[Intro: MNEK]
Yeah, yeah

[Chorus: MNEK]
They may not play this on the radio
So I'm gonna make damn sure
This is the realest shit I ever wrote
So hear my spirit roar
Roar free, in myself
Through my melody
Kill this thug, it's a felony
I'll make sure you remember me
I'll make sure you remember

[Verse 1: Tinie Tempah]
Uh, climb new heights and I break new grounds
Got a new crib and you can't come round
This year haters gonna big me up
This year no one's gonna hold me down
Yeah, I'm the shit, yo word to my bowels
I don't wear snapbacks, yo I wear crowns
Price as rich if I wasn't this blick
Price as big if I wasn't this proud
Yeah, 8 years sittin' on top
Yeah, I been there, done that, had that what
'Fore I did rap, had two, two jobs
Hip-hop, Grime and then I went pop
Trade your life for my life, let's swap
Go clean in my dad's old shop with a mop
Where a man knew if a guy was gettin' money on the ends
When he used to wear Lyle & Scott
Used to love hoes, now I want bae
Used to want dough, now I want change
Used to be wilder, now I'm more tame
Used to be crazy, now I'm insane
Yeah, I'm insane, yeah
Talkin' to the mirror like, "How did I get this vain?"
TBT '07 and 8
Me and Rich like how we gonna get this played
I was like, mate, uh

[Chorus: MNEK]
They may not play this on the radio
So I'm gonna make damn sure
This is the realest shit I ever wrote (that I ever wrote)
So hear my spirit roar
Roar free, in myself
Through my melody
Kill this thug, it's a felony
I'll make sure you remember me
I'll make sure you remember

[Verse 2: Tinie Tempah]
Yeah, uh, I think she in love with a married man
I fell in love with a married chick
Sometimes I drive to a random place
Sometimes I'm scared of not havin' shit
Sometimes I fear I might lose it all
It's such a crazy world, law of averages
I don't know how Drizzy manages
I don't know how Jigga manages
Nearly fell apart in the first year
Didn't think that I can handle it
Wu-Tang Clan, Gravel Pit
Whip smelling like we sellin' cannabis
Who in the fuck do they think they are?
Hope they don't think I'm some any guy
Hope they don't think I'ma let it slide
I got every single line memorised
Love letter to the city, city, city
Love letter to my city
Thank you for fuckin' with me
I know the mayor, I know the nitties
Lost some payings but I gained the masses
Wrote my will before I made a classic
Take a pill and let it change to magic
Fuck whoever tryna hate on Patrick

[Chorus: MNEK & Ray BLK]
They may not play this on the radio
So I'm gonna make damn sure
This is the realest shit I ever wrote (that I ever wrote)
So hear my spirit roar
Roar free, in myself (roar free)
Through my melody
Kill this thug, it's a felony (it's a felony, it's a felony)
I'll make sure you remember me
I'll make sure you remember

[Post-Chorus: MNEK & Ray BLK]
This is my
Love letter to the city, city, city
Love letter to my city
Thank you for fuckin' with me
Thank you for fuckin' with me

[Bridge: Tinie Tempah]
We bring the stars out
We bring the whole Geordie Shore cast out
Got the mandem, up in Bizarre, wow
I'm in Val d'Is√®re, I'm in France now
I ain't even tryna gloat
We the only black boys skiin' on slopes
Where's the Rizla and the roach?
Ace boy with the carpet and the rope, uh

[Chorus: MNEK & Ray BLK]
They may not play this on the radio
So I'm gonna make damn sure
This is the realest shit I ever wrote (that I ever wrote)
So hear my spirit roar
Roar free, in myself
Through my melody
Kill this thug, it's a felony
I'll make sure you remember me, yeah (I'll make sure)
I'll make sure you remember me
Said you'll remember
Always gon' remember, always gon' remember

[Outro: Tinie Tempah]
Climb new heights and I break new grounds
Got a new crib and you can't come round
This year haters gonna big me up
This year no one's gonna hold me down
Yeah, I'm the shit, yo word to my bowels
I don't wear snapbacks, yo I wear crowns
Price as rich if I wasn't this blick
Price as big if I wasn't this proud, yeah
