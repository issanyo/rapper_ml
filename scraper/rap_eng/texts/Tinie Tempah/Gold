[Verse 1]
I can feel it in the air
I'm here, I'm geared, I'm ready, I'm aware
I've been waiting for a chance like this
All day, all week, all month, all year
Yeah, to be at the top I put all my bloood, my sweat, my tears
For my career and the cheers
I made a wish, I said a prayer
But there's still a long way
To run things you've gotta win a long race
Sunshine means a longer day
Rappers wanna be heavy but don't want the weight
What more can I ask now
I'm in the spotlight with my arms out
I said Distrubing London was gonna branch out
Stand up and where ever you are shout

[Hook]
(Gold) I wanna scream out (Gold)
(Gold) I wanna scream out (Gold)
We've only begun
There's so much to come
Straight to the finish line
We've already won
We're going for gold
We're going for gold

[Verse 2]
We started off local, ain't gonna stop til we're global
Big up all my boys playing pro-pool
All students and all future Olympic hopefuls
At time life gets so so
You have your ups and downs like yo-yos
And bad luck comes round that will turn your whole world upside down like snow globes
But I'm so close, I'm nearly there
[?] perri√®re, sincerely yeah
Talk loud til the whole world clearly hears
Nigga listen I am 21 years prepared
Don't say nothin' if you don't care to share
Haters can kiss my derriere
But if you stick by me year to year
Nigga make some noise so the world can hear

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
So close, so near
Slow motion but show no fear
So right, so rare
Another feeling don't compare
And it's all too much to take
The pressure can make you suffocate
And then you realise what you've done to date
Let's celebrate cause we run the race

[Hook x2]
