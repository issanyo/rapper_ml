[Hook: Willow]
I whip my hair back and forth
I whip my hair back and forth (just whip it)
I whip my hair back and forth
I whip my hair back and forth (whip it real good)
I whip my hair back and forth
I whip my hair back and forth
I whip my hair back and forth
I whip my hair back and forth

[Verse 1: Tinie]
Now this riddim was made by a youngun
So I'm tryna watch my tongue before I go and say something
I'm crazy and I'm stubborn, rocking Paisley like it's nothing
Fuck size zero models, they're too veiny and disgusting
All my niggas in sync so I guess I'm playing Justin
E-e-every day I'm hustling's why my chain is so encrusted
I'm Dmitry Medvedev, all my words will rush
I don't just have my cake and eat it, bitch I have that cake with custard
I must've stumbled from the jungle
Cause I can't be fucking human, man, I'm really tryna be humble
Over a million singles sold, my fans just keep on buying these bundles
Daddy's really tryna be Dad, uncle's really tryna be Uncle
Man, my life so good, I can't even grumble
But push me and I'll turn this place into a royal rumble
Cause I whip it, I whip it, I whip it back and forth
And the gas ain't getting to my head, yeah, astronaut

[Verse 2: Willow]
Hop up out the bed, turn my swag on
Pay no attention to them haters
Because we whip 'em off
And we ain’t doin' nothin' wrong
So don’t tell me nothin'
I’m just trying to have fun
So keep the party jumping
So what's up? (yeah)
And now they don't know what to do
We turn our back and whip our hair and just;
Shake em off, shake em off
Shake em off, shake em off

[Pre-Hook: Willow]
Don’t let haters get me off my grind
Whip my hair, if I know I’ll be fine
Keep fighting until I get there
When I’m down and I feel like giving up
(I think again)

[Hook: Willow](x2)

[Verse 3: Willow]
I'mma get more shine in a little bit
Soon as I hit the stage applause
I’m hearing it
Whether is black stars, black cars
I’m feelin it
But can't none of them whip it like I do (I)
I get to the mm-yeah go hard
When they see me pull up
I whip it real hard
I whip it real hard
Real hard
I whip it real hard

[Pre-Hook] + [Hook](x2)

[Bridge: Willow](x2)
All my ladies if you feel it
Gone and do it, do it
Whip your hair (whip your hair)
Don’t matter if it’s long, short
Do it, do it whip your hair!

[Hook](x2)
