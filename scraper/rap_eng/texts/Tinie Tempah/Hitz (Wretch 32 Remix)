[Intro]
I make hits. Not the public!
I tell the DJs what to play. Understand?
Weed is the original don of all dons
Weed is the original don of all dons
I make hits. Not the public!
I tell the DJs what to play. Understand?

[Verse 1: Tinie Tempah]
Uh!
Baa baa black sheep, rock star, rap G
Make enough dough to own a black card, that's deep
I've been getting real fucking friendly with the banks man
And I don't mean Phil, Carlton, Hilary or Ashley
Papz see me up in the vicinity and flash me
I'm the definition of definitive and catchy
The only thing that's bigger, quicker, slicker
More black and more upper London is a taxi
Bitch I'm so sick, I need a mother fucking vaccine
Pinky ring shine like some mother fucking vaseline
Centre of attention like a Bang & Olufsen
HD (scratch) in vision for a flat screen
The only ever time I see you niggas on
Kiss is like 2am or when you go to pucker up
Nought to sixty in four, babe you need to buckle up
All my women so Zoo, all my women so Nuts

[Hook: Kivenc Sezen]
Don't say that I didn't ever warn ya
Swear down, I told ya
(Weed is the original don of all dons)
Don't cross the line, don't make me have to show ya
Don't say that I didn't ever warn ya
Stop lyin', I saw ya
(Weed is the original don of all dons)
Don't cross the line, don't make me have to show ya

[Verse 2: Tinie Tempah]
So raw and uncut, no fucking edits
She won't even get a hype, she made no fucking effort
And all you silly singers and you ring tone rappers
Like school dinner curries
My car is a unleaded, got a yard with a terrace
She called me chauvinistic but she can't even spell it
I don't wanna hear another nigga say you fly
If you ain't never been on business class on the Emirates
I'm a racket, I'm tennis, I'm Dennis, I'm a menace
Call me Rob Pattinson, I got a lot of niggas jealous
I'm a mentos mint in a can of Dr Pepper
That's tick, tick, tick, tick, boom to you fellas
Tom Ford, nigga, Martin Margiela
Ain't lipsing if her name ain't Remi or Stella
Got a big bag of tricks and Mary Poppin's umbrella
Cause we're 'bout to rain on them like London weather

[Hook: Kivenc Sezen]
Don't say that I didn't ever warn ya
Swear down, I told ya
(Weed is the original don of all dons)
Don't cross the line, don't make me have to show ya
Don't say that I didn't ever warn ya
Stop lyin', I saw ya
(Weed is the original don of all dons)
Don't cross the line, don't make me have to show ya

[Verse 3: Wretch 32]
Now I ain't saying I'm a legend, but when I die they'll remember me
Full stop, you couldn't put an end to me
If the whole game's about hits
I've got the balls, I'mma be here for a century
The boy in me got me feeling like spoiling me
My royalties got me feeling like royalty
Yeah, and I'm just living my dream (ahh yeah)
Can't believe that I get employed to sleep
Welcome to my dream world
I've been a living nightmare for your dream girl
She'll probably say I'm well mean but I mean well
Cause Alexander's my queen when I retail
Well, I got my name on my trainers
You runners up will be chasing my status
I use my card when I wanna change suit
You can't walk in my trousers, they're tailored

[Hook: Kivenc Sezen]
Don't say that I didn't ever warn ya
Swear down, I told ya
(Weed is the original don of all dons)
Don't cross the line, don't make me have to show ya
Don't say that I didn't ever warn ya
Stop lyin', I saw ya
Don't cross the line, don't make me have to show ya
