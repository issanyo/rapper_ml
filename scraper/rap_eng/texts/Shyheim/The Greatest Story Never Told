[Intro: Shyheim] + (Jasmine Rae)
Man, I'm givin' a shout out to my mother and father
That's currently locked up in correctional facility in New York state
I just came home, man, you know what I'm sayin', it's real
Thank you for your support, love, loyalty, respect trust and honor
(Yeah, I've been through ups and downs, I've had so many days
Thinkin' and dreamin', with no real direction, come on
Shy, what's good?, let 'em know)

[Hook: Jasmine Rae]
I've been through ups and downs, I've had so many days
Thinkin' and dreamin', and growin', with no real direction
They're comes a better time, and from a clearer way
Let it unfold, my life's the greatest story never told

I've been through ups and downs, I've had so many days
Thinkin' and dreamin', and growin', with no real direction
They're comes a better time, and from a clearer way
Let it unfold, my life's the greatest story never told

[Shyheim]
My life's the greatest story never told, I really want y'all to know
Shyheim won't be a fake or fraud, that fronts and fold
Made my contribution, to hip hop history
And I'm one of the only niggas that ever rocked, with 'Pac and Biggie
At the same time, with one mic, that night is crazy
In '93, I did joints with Big Daddy Kane and Jay-Z
I'm the youngest veteran, muthafuckas, I'm back at it
Even though my moms was a drug addict, made it to the big screen, acting
With Pam Grier, Denzel Washington and Whitney
Parenthood, with Robert Towsnend, listen up, you still with me?
I'm shorty who got shot, in Waterfalls, TLC video
R.I.P., Left Eye, mama, you still with me, yo
I wrote songs for Raven Symone, went on tour, with Immature
And Vicious, catalog's long, I'm written in Wu-Tang scriptures

[Hook: Jasmine Rae]
I've been through ups and downs, I've had so many days
Thinkin' and dreamin', and growin', with no real direction
They're comes a better time, and from a clearer way
Let it unfold, my life's the greatest story never told

I've been through ups and downs, I've had so many days
Thinkin' and dreamin', and growin', with no real direction
They're comes a better time, and from a clearer way
Let it unfold, my life's the greatest story never told

[Shyheim]
Smokin' that dust so much, really put me off balance
It made me crazy violent, I was bullshitting, wastin' my talent
On Shaolin, Mother Mallon, used to tell me boy you fuckin' off
Ridin' around..
