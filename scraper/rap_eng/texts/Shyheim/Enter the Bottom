You want a chick likes mines? A whip likes mines?
A four fifth with a kit that lick like mines?
That look like mines, you want a piece of the pie?
You want go to Cinderella's and throw ones in the sky?
But you can't be I, big S-H-Y
Got crazy niggas on payroll, like S.S.I
You think you really want drama, for the rest of your life
It ain't easy being greasy, my neezy, believe me
I got felonies, nigga, got Big L in me, nigga
Slow's ya cell in me, nigga, people taking my picture
The young God fisher, Bottom Up Militia
Getting richer and richer, and I'm a Staten Island, nigga
You should B.U., nigga, cuz you can't be me
Bottom Up, C.E.O., L.E.O., V.V
Bottom Up Embassy, the sugar honey iced tea
Ay, bishop, so you wanna be a gangsta
Don't bishop, when we raise them k's up
When I come, I raise four, why was I caged up?
See, I ate, everybody want heaven, but they not want dead
Everybody wanna hustle, but them not want feds
I'm America's ghetto idol, fuck what Simon says

[Lucky Me]
Fuck what Simon says...
It's amazed, I'm never afraid, my struggle's, my energy
Just me, the war is on, got me feeling timid
My goal's the gold, I'mma get it, I'mma spend it
Yeah, I'm a fighter, I talk it, cuz I always live it
Yeah, I was bragging like the kid, what's back now
Life is strange, cuz I be tripping, to get packs out
And they won't squeeze, so you won't catch me now
I got a heart of God, plus I'm smart so the devil won't get me
Yeah, but I'mma get mines by any means
Just me, I don't need a team, no crack, I don't need the fiends
It's like since I left ball, they took my dream
I be smoking, getting high, is not for me
Like round ball, now watch me get it up
I break rules, but girls, they give it up
I speak the truth, one year past, now I'm back where I started from
No money's saved, one kid made me another one
Or a life lesson, or could it be I'm just dumb
Lucky Me, make dollars, true believers
I overcome everything, I'm close to a genius
I fell so many times, I can't count no more
So what's the reason why ya'll counting for?
From the Bottom, the Bottom, the top of the top, I'm still close to the floor
I'm rich, I wasn't born to be poor, I wanna do shows
Radio City, Canargie Hall
Hot 97, freestyling, getting it on
A-Town stomping, I'm doing songs with Lil' Jon
To get me a wifey, maybe Christiana Milian
Who you know, get it popping like me
Lucky Me, man, I'm hot in these streets

[C-Tera]
You think you nice, nigga? I'm twice these niggas
To tell the truth, man, I don't even like these niggas
This was 199 some, I would fight these niggas
This a new millennium, I have to light these niggas
I was down on my luck, it was fuck me, nigga
Now that I'm on, and you not, fuck you niggas
That's right I cuss you niggas, I don't trust you niggas
I got 27 styles, just for you niggas
And I'm a real life cat, before I was rapping
That mean when shit jumped off, I'm coming out clapping
And I'mma write a verse about it, just like it happens
So they can play it on 106 and Park, and get it cracking, nigga
Heat backing out the side of the whip
Blood leaking from the side of your life, stop snitching, nigga
