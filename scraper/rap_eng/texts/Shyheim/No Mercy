[Intro: sample from "The Karate Kid"]
Fear does not exist in this dojo, does it? (No, sensei)
Pain does not exist in this dojo, does it? (No, sensei)
Defeat does not exist in this dojo...

[Chorus: sample from "The Karate Kid"]
(Strike first, strike hard, no mercy) I, can't, hear you
(Strike first, strike hard, no mercy) I, can't, hear you
(Strike first, strike hard, no mercy) I, can't, hear you
(Strike first, strike hard, no mercy) I, can't, hear you

[Shyheim]
Talk about my life, whenever I rhyme
I don't just make up shit, to finish a line
Or sample the next man, to describe my grind
Catch me doing, never try'nna, cuz I'm destined to shine
Shyheim don't give a fuck, if the feds is watching
Being broke ain't an option, I'm brought in Tompkins
For the love of this dope money, it gets to popping
And after you die, shit still ain't stopping
Switch ships round the clocking, twelve to six
Six to twelve, Chef it in the kitchen, that's that fix you smell
Sales got me in the six, with some six spreewells
Made the plan to be the man when I was in 16th cell
Figured out right here on Earth, there's a heaven and hell
It's getting so hot, in here, it got me feeling like nail
Figured out the plan when I was in 16th cell
Now I'm sitting in the six, with some six spreewells

[Chorus]

[Shyheim]
Oh well, this is life, I just gotta deal with it
I'd change a lot of shit, if I had a meal ticket
My moms'll have a drag, or shoot some bags of bee lizard
Every weekend at the prison, my dad'll have a visit
If I had mad gwop, all this bullshit'll stop
Money don't mean everything, but it sure means alot
When your feets in the street, and you wake up to nothing to eat
Things are better in your dreams, so you go back to sleep
There was times, I wish I died in mines
All I had worth everything was my book of rhymes
As I look up to the sky and get lost in the clouds
I found out, nothing's new under the sun, so how
Can something be discovered, my pain and rain
It's thunder, the same as my chain brother

[Outro: Shyheim]
And I love you niggas, you my comrades...
Uncle Tah, keep ya head up, stay strong, nigga
G's up, nigga, you heard?
