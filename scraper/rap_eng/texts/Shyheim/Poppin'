[Intro: IMF Blue Steele]
Yeah, yeah, yeah... Big dog, yeah, yeah...
IMF Blue, yeah... One shot, yeah...
Embassy, yeah... Big Lou, yeah...
Yeah, yeah, yeah... Holla at me!

[IMF Blue Steele]
Alright, The IMF Blue is ready to go
When I put my chain on it's like I'm buried in snow (haha)
I gotta get Con Eddie to roll
Cuz when Con Eddie roll it's already a show
(We get it popping, popping, popping) No joke, bro, roll, lemme smoke mo'
IMF is amazing, and move with a swagger, don't leave on the pavement
Cuz he'll show you bastards the reason ya hating
(We get it popping, popping, popping)
When I fall on the spot, I make sure I got my dogs to the spot
Cuz if not, them niggas might be throwing some shots
And somebody might be calling the cops, y'all just watch
(We get it popping, popping, popping) Wherever we at
That's why you never ever let me react
I'm (popping, popping, popping) And I'm fleeing the scene
I do it big with just me and my team

[Chorus 4X: IMF Blue Steele]
We get it popping, popping, popping
And ain't no stopping him, the IMF keep on rocking it
Listening, ain't no stopping INF

[IMF Blue Steele]
Now, I tried to hop skip to the bar
But the club was so big, how you get to the bar?
Damn, I got a pocket full of jars
A thicky so raw but I need a cigar
(We get it popping, popping, popping) Nothing but ass out
A lot of niggas getting they blunt rolled or passed out
(We get it popping, popping, popping)
And I'm up in the spot, got my cup filled up to the top
And you should know if I'm there, I'm sipping something
I got the whole party, bop dipping jumping
It's (popping, popping, popping) We got the vans wrapped
Lou's in front of the club, like where my man's at
(Popping, popping, popping) But we in already, we all posted
Look at the itinerary (popping, popping, popping)
Now I'm trying to score
Now I already got my eyes on a whore
And I ain't got time to throw game to a slut
Nope, I pull her to the side and say the name of my truck

[Chorus 4X]

[IMF Blue Steele]
Now, we dove outside of the spot
I'm drunk, moving side to side with a bop
I just finished taking pulls of that raw
And Grant spilled a whole cup on my velour
It's (popping, popping, popping) And I ain't mad at that
Mami got a big ol' butt, I'm a stab at that
Asked her was she coming with me? She did the cabbage patch
Got a lot of karets with me, so where ya rappers at?
(popping, popping, popping) We all Benzes, all be pigeons, y'all all get in
This (popping, popping, popping) Don't stand still
You know you want it, why you looking in my man grill?
Come on, ma', you in his face for real
Cuz his earring's looking like a baseball field
But it's (popping, popping, popping) So we cruising, doing what we doing
You know I ditch, tell a bitch, "Quick, hold my dick"
And pull off in a 4.6, we pop shit

[Chorus 4X]
