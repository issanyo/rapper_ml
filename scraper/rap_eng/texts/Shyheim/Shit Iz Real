[Intro]
Yeah yeah, hah
Where all my niggas at?
We up in here, what?
Word up, all my peoples
Crim-criminals in the penile
Where ya at? Cats sacking green
Bill/Hill Clinton

[Hook]
It be real when I pack a steel
Everyman for himdelf send my love to a battlefield
Ain't no wack, it's a straight up fact
Or dip down in black once you hear the clap clap

[Verse 1]
Shit is real, ain't no time to catch no butterflies
Pass the St. Ide's screwface is my disguise
Don't look me in my eyes that ain't wise
The first chump that jumps is the first chump that dies
Raw, spell that backward that's war
Lay low scarecrow I'm knocking at your front door
Pointing a pistol to your peekhole, pussy
Warning: my trigger finger gets pushy
Blaow, a single shot straight to the headpiece
Decrease the peace and watch the murders increase
See I'm ruthless, pistol whip a nigga toothless
Me getting hit that shit is ludicrous
I'm on my P's and my Q's
Try to put your foot in my shoes kid
You gotta pay the fucking dues
I ain't the one to play Pammy
I leave the head all red like that little orphan Annie
I'm dressed in black like Streets of Harlem
Pat punk's pockets down with no problem
And get away just like an Unsolved Mystery
You don't believe me G, check my pedigree
And you can feel how I deal with the motherfucking steel
Ain't no game boy, it's real

[Hook x2]
It be real when I pack a steel
Everyman for himdelf send my love to a battlefield
Ain't no wack, it's a straight up fact
Or dip down in black once you hear the clap clap

[Verse 2]
Shit is real, I'm in some real shit
Niggas wet up the lab, Ma Dukes got hit
Now they knew I was trying to give em what I owe em
But now I gotta act like I don't know em
The motherfuckers violated to the fullest degree
They did it smart, now they gotta see me
And I'ma flip like an acrobat,to get them bastards back
And let them know where my head is at
I pack a cannon, I know where them faggots be standing
Near the stores, with them Hip Hop whores
And there I was all dipped and fatigued
Going Rambo, G.I. Joe of a dolo
Dropping bodies, bodies they was dropping
Like rain from a black man that went insane
They dissed my Earth I had to diss they whole universe
Blew up the block, stepped back then watched it burst
Niggas was running, I was steady gunning em down
They hitting the ground from the impact of the four pound
Some kids tried to dip in the whip, I emptied the clip
And watched a car do a fucking flip
Reloaded at the same time the car exploded
Spotted a Gangsta Bitch, told her to hold it
It only took five secs for she squealed, Blaka! Blaka!
Two shots to the twat, shit is real

[Hook x2]
It be real when I pack a steel
Everyman for himdelf send my love to a battlefield
Ain't no wack, it's a straight up fact
Or dip down in black once you hear the clap clap
