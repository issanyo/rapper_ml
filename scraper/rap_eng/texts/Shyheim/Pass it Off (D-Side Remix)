[All] Pass it off I wanna flip
[Shy] I got the loaded clip
[All] Pass it off and move it back
[DLR] I'm reachin in my napsack
[All] Pass it off I wanna flip
[Rub] Let me show you how
[All] Pass it off (*echoes*)

[Shyheim]
You better look out kid cuz I'm the Wu-Tang's smallest artist
When I come thru brothas be jettin like I'm narcotics
I'm the shorty that'll bust but yet I hit the hardest
When I rose up on ya squad just show me where ya heart is
You'll start to snitch like a {bitch}, cold drop a dime
I cut that {ass} short like a tree of alpine
But I'm not lumberjack, black and a matter of fact
I flip your stacks like two kilo's of crack packs
I let off quick like a four-fifth automatic
Who got Static like Spike Lee? I gotta have it
And I'm the bomb like a black leather jacket
I keep it movin like I did on my first LP
I stay true to The Grain of G.P
Word to my motha I could never be a sucka
I Die Hard too, yipee-cahier motha{fucka}

[Down Low Recka]
Now it's the Down Low comin thru with the roughness
Technique, brothas packin needles can't bust this
Teflon style that I master, my art
Hit the chart, wait, combine with the track from the heart
I take shape and break, the best when they fake
Maneuvers, are natural born when into these losers
Ego bruiser, fly wiz chooser
Marijuana user, Valentine Hell enducer
Be too slick and sly for the guy with the best try
Brotha fake a move, ya gotta die
I got the loaded clip and I'm about to show ya how
We murder brothas style with the slang from the Shaolin Isle
Now...

[All] Pass it off I wanna flip
[DLR] I got the loaded clip

[Pop] I'm reachin in my napsack

[Pop Da Brown Hornet]
It's about time to bust a cherry, or should I say a {nut}?
You can run if you want to, I'll still catch you in your butt
My aim is on point like a racist cop
And I get down and dirty like a project mop
If you're in between a crack I'll find just where you're at
Expose you, beat ya butt like no one knows you
I have no sympathy for no mouse MC
Once I snap you in my trap there ain't no turnin back
I got you where I want you, that's under my wing
You ain't it, your wisdom treats me like a king
So please motha f'er with that premium choice {shit}
By the looks of things, I think that it's best ya forfeit
A true experience should be taken for a scroll
I'm big time baby, ya gonna need a centerfold

[Rubbabandz]
Murder, all I see is gats in my mind
Cock back ready for combat, pass the nine
I'm a mind blower, constructin boats like Noah
So I could never drown in this rap thing
I keeps it real, like Shaquille O'Neal on the court
You better recognize or get played like a sport
My flow's comin down, somethin terrible
Down pat when I be on the train ridin R tracks
Styles is phat, contact, the lyrical smoke got me open
Infact, I think I'm ready to rock steady
I leave ya white like Betty
Froze you and plus you're not quick like Ever-ready
Oh shhh that clown just took the bait
And lost more blood then Nobra lost weight
Prepare for gladiation, I'ma slam the nation
It doesn't matter if you're Japanese or Jamaican

Yo, the rhymes that I be kickin be the bomb baby
I be the bomb on this swarm, that's a fact I got it goin on
What's that a doubt? I'm never on a lyrical drought
My mind out concentrated, so I let my long thesis out
And represent to the fullest, I don't be fakin
I {shit} you out of service like some bugged out Jamaican
