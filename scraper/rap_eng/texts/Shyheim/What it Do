[Chorus 2X: Rodo]
All ya'll tell me what it do
From my hood and your hood, I'm good, what it do
I'm blowing off sticky green and I came fast as you
Cuz you too, far away, oh what it do

[J-illa]
I'm in ya hood like what it do, daddy, do daddy
Rodo the truth, he swerve in the blue caddy
What it do, you got that purpl' and kush
The swisher sweets, that's what it do, hah, let's ride
What it do, let's cruise through the east side
See I'm playing the strings, so I'mma let the beat ride
Where Pace at? I seen ya'll in east side
What it do, west side, north Chuck, south Chuck
What it do? Keep dipping on the jake, dog
Keep blowing that sticky, keep getting cake, dog
That's what it do, in the club, in the VIP section
That's what it do, that's what it do, cuz
See Hypnotic got my mind gone, cuz I seen this chick
In the club that got my dick ticking like a time bomb
What it do, ma, shit I'm trying to take you places
Like Vegas, you might meet Sean John

[Chorus 2X]

[Shyheim]
I'm in the hood like, what it do, slut, what it D.O
I'm in the laundrymat putting in this last load
The assholes drive slow, who the assholes?
The assholes is po-po, if you didn't know
Well any old way, it's just a regular old day
And, I get a call from West D.A
And, it's the comrade J-illa, he like 'say man'
'What it take, man, for us to do a little tape, man'
Hoodie on my head, niggas still recognize me
They see me coming and run like the exercise, B
They thought they seen The Exorcist when I arrived, see
Fresher than a pimp, and I'm cleaner than Ivor
S.I.N.Y., Cyanide's where I be
S-Town where niggas be tripping off that bomb b
Asking about Shyheim, niggas tell you that I'm chief
Rep 7 everyday, but nothing bout me weak, nigga

[Chorus 2X]

[J-illa]
Damn you look good, ma, tell me what ya name is
Is you real or faking, tell me what your game is
With me it's all or nathan, tell me what ya range is
Just by staring at you, tell me what it do
If I'mma hit the club up, I'mma hit it up on 22's
Just what it do, D.K.N.Y. loc's on, I'm seeing everything
Act up and get stole on wit the range of a convict
That came parole home, I'm feeling shit
If you don't want no problems, you better move, cuz
I'm so hot, like them flow tech, out it, cuz
You screaming on 'em, what it do, if you feeling my vibe
My vibe be feeling you, what it do, woo
This goes on and on Shy, west Vicca, keeping it hood, man
So welcome to my hood, man
We both drink Henny, so it's all wood grain
That's what it do, killa, I see ya killas ain't killed nothing
Illa still here, I'm living proof, nigga

[Chorus 2X]
