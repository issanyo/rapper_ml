[Chorus 2X: Desert Eagle]
You can see it from far, you can see it from near
You can see it from here, nigga, look at my (back)
You can see it from Brooklyn, Manhattan, or the Stat
You can see it on the track, nigga, look at my (back)

[Desert Eagle]
I told niggas look at my back, yo your boy feen' to
Mow niggas, show niggas, how to fluff crack
Young and old niggas know I know Crack, you can catch me in the trap
If you really trying to catch me for a track
Feen to blow niggas reppin' for the Stat, pimp or stay
Fine riders, line riders, reppin' to the max
Nigga, look at my back, it's looking like Texas
On the map, I'm the widest and I'm stepping with a mack
Swiss cheese and level three, better be ready for the brat
I'm punk, ya little niggas not ready for the match
Nigga, kill all rats, spit pesticides on wax
Ya'll done caught hella bodies on dat
Ain't put in no work, hella hommys on wax
Can't do nothing with me, hella mamis know that
I'm still, in the lac, low, tommy on my lap
Scrambler Stones, coming through, they got my back

[Chorus 2X]

[Chunk Amillo]
Step through, g-slack, pardon my back
I'm 16, strong team, hear them semi's who clap
It's really a wrap, Chunk and in the team, on the map
I'm back with Bull, kick you, turn and run in ya back
I ain't no wrap, but Chunk, but still about his cheese
Any nigga gon' act, then that nine gon' squeeze
I prolly then breeze, leave ya body ready to bleed
My bullets pop up and slang, ain't no dungarees
It's the Stone Rangers, and you know we spitting that crack
Just know, we take ya chain, you ain't getting it back
So the next time you hear me, on that next hot track
You like, yo, that's that nigga who told me pardon his back

[Chorus 2X]

[Desert Eagle]
King of words, full fledge, king of the verb
Dump lead, to be king of the curb
Ruling my hood, trying to be king of the birds
Crown me king of the ring, Jah, king of the herb
God Allah be the king of the earth, didn't King James
Get a bible, his birth'll title the church
King Just crush Summer Jam first, I'm a Buick and my bitch
Got that H2 Hummer in the skirt
And my lover never get a nigga murked
Cuz mami got a semi in her purse, a Philly full of chirp
Guaranteed she a libra, nigga, murk
Think I been in dirt, DNG's, nigga, putting in the work
I'm a dartsmen, I put 'em through ya girth
Make ya knees buckle, two llama shots, send them to church
Deadly venom, and I hit 'em til it hurts
Dart for dart, I'm a master at my artwork, nigga

[Chorus 2X]
