[Intro: Lord Superb (Shyheim)]
Aiyo, the Rugged Child is something else, man
First met that nigga (I ain't even like ya'll niggas)
Straight told me that shit, man (don't be coming in my circle)
They like why, he don't fuck with a lot of clowns (I heard you)
Straight business dude, you know? Up front type of guy

[Shyheim]
Yo, I don't rock with you dick-in-the-butt-ass kids
You ain't a thug with this saw-headed doing bids
Kill a what? You wouldn't kill a fly
Nigga, front like you ready to die, cuz you high
But when I let the ten milli, buck on that, who done it
Bloods take it in blood, your life is a course
I give your girl a dog dick, to tell her more, bitch
And cluck like the bird that she is, but that's your wifey
Since I came out, she like me, Rugged Child fanclub, she write me
Get hype g, lose your windpipe, breath through your tube
I love to win, I hate to lose, one of them crazy Wu-Tang dudes
A Killa Bee, I attack the suite, niggas killing me
Softly, talking bout the street
What they know about this life? I think they persian
Close the curtain, stop the press, they can't fuck with the S

[Chorus 2X: Shyheim (Lord Superb)]
It's hard to cope with (cope with) so they smoke shit (smoke shit)
You ain't equivalent (equivalent) you suck ass and you suck a dick
You ain't dangerous (dangerous), you ain't terrorist (terrorist)
Go against, and you will pay the penalty (you shall pay)

[Shyheim]
I'm giving you the cold shoulder, lil' nigga
But a big notorious gun holder, cocoa broke
I get it fresh and white, like a boulder
There, pump it anywhere, spots, blocks, still
I got to get this money like Tiger Woods
Dick good, so I'm wanted by the shorties in the hood
Once moved like valor, and rock a worldwide tour
Fuck a BMW, I wanna buy a store
What you selling crack for, your looks? You ain't a crook
In the 4 building, you got your Air Max took
And yea I can respect, Tommy Hill down
On the V.I. with the specs, cuz when my numb bust
Clear the echo, I'm so bad, I get bail with a parole hoe
Guzzle them Olde Gold

[Chorus 2X]

[Outro: Lord Superb (Shyheim)]
Killa Kane (Reddy Red) Red One, that nigga Pull, Pop
Tray (Stapleton) you know, Shaolin, (Ill P) the Rugged Child is here forever
(Real Gil), the millennium, the millennium, (Debo)
(All my niggas locked down, we don't go against the grain)
Forever, nigga (if we do, death is a penalty)
Superb signing out (I don't fuck with ya'll, chop my head off, you know?)
