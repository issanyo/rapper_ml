Chorus (x4)
Say yeah!
Come on ya!

Here I am, here I am, where you at?
I be the ruff cat with a back and the napsack
Takeing all the shorties out with my wicked flow
Wu-tang on the go, never slow time to blow
Up so wuzz up, you better duck or get buck
Live cool shortie who don't give a flying fuck
So whats up sonie? Now let me throw the the Kay
The little rascal with a fade and rugged boxs braise
So a born a born terror, a.k.a a rugged child
Niggas on my tip so hard I be the life style
But I get silky, go for you like milk gee
Brothers sun on wack on waxs like Milli Vanilli
Uhh! you know I've got the style with the flavor
When I stick you up you need more then life savers
If I rob a bank can't forget to be swip and if he runs his lip
That as will be his

Chorus (x4)
Say yeah!
Come on ya!

Im the jam, I slam, cause I am the man, hut damn!
