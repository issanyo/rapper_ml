[Hook: Hell Razah]
You got my back, I got your front
From start to finish
Goin' out altogether cause we're co-defendants
Take my back, got your front
From start to finish
Goin' out altogether cause we're co-defendants
Got your back, take my front
From start to finish
Goin' out altogether cause we're co-defendants
Got my back, got your front
From start to finish
Goin' out altogether cause we're co-defendants

[Shyheim]
I'm a N.W.A. with a nineteen shot glizzy
I'm Mo' Thug than Krazyie, Layzie, Flesh, Wish and Bizzy
I'm too wild, you don't wanna see my act up
Police gotta call the national guard for back up
My shit don't stink, I never tuck my link
Shyheim never sleepin, my eyes just chinky
And my army moves same, same

[Hell Razah]
Stick him for his mink
Yall niggas on some frontin shit, amped off a drink
Money like the Brinks truck, bomb you till you faint
I roll with top rank, soon to judge the angels sing

[Shyheim]
I'm ghetto like SunDu, Wu-Tang Clansman
We banned from the tunnel

[Hell Razah]
We're scorin touchdowns, while yall wack rappers fumble

[Shyheim]
And talk about the projects, we never see you come through
Catch em at their shows, they're hidin in a limo

[Hell Razah]
We claimin Donnie Brasco, black Robert Deniros
We're dirty street heros in the six double zeros

[Shyheim]
Benzes, Glocks with the infra-red lenses
Money over bitches, like P, I'm infamous

[Hell Razah]
Thoughts is infinte, me and Shy run together
Like concurrent sentences

[Shyheim]
We're co-defendants, society's menace
I became a Jon Doe, so I can't be printed

[Hook: Shyheim]

[Hell Razah]
Aiyyo, it's war faces, I see outside the court cases
Ezekiel, first chapter comes the bone body fracture
I roll with player haters, down to mad rappers
Out to put the gat to anybody playin actor
Climbin up Jacob's Ladder, the common factor
Red hook, never shook, crooks, you get your shit took
Black hook indian givers with a sick look

[Shyheim]
Hit with the book, I was hit with the book
I'm a walkin timebomb, I smoke weed to keep me calm
The psychic said, "I'm a bad muhfucka"
When she read my palms, I been armed fuck a felony
And with my moms tellin me, I'm twenty-seven D.B.D
For reals in a magnet, in the incenerator
Is where we stash the krills
It's all about the hundred dollar bills, Nigga what
If shorty pussy too big, I stick it in her butt

[Hook x2: both]
