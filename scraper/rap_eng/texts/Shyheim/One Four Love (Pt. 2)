[Verse 1 - Shyheim]
The precinct is crooked.  My man got grabbed up
Had cracks on him worth about a bullet
They just took it, asked him a few questions like, "Where the guns?"
They tried to G him to tell them where was Un (how they come?)
Ten deep in a red 15 Passenger
Guns out when they jumped out, pointed at us
Here comes what they call a procedure
Slammin' us against a gate, cuffin' us before they beat us

[Verse 2 - Channel Live]
It's like they can't trust us, they wanna bust us and rush us
They sayin' "F" us.  There's no peace, no just-us
They claim to protect us, they serve and they wreck us
Never respect us, arrest us and always stress us

To see the Devil die is my purpose of [?]
Self-determinance is the must, I practice Kujichagulia
Yo, free your mind and yo *bitch* is sure to follow
And when freed men come to lock it down, look out for tips that's hollow

[Verse 3 - Wise Intelligent of Poor Righteous Teachers]
It's P.I.T. Soprano
Mix it down, dedicated to Steve Feliciano
Directed at Steve McGarrett and Danno
F' the 5-0 pronto cause I know
First head to take the white and burst lead
Never did but might have to do it
Lies, twenty-five, hollow shots in a pro-active unit
Exit 7A, NJ stop the BS movement—that's how we do it
Mobilize the people, conscious *niggas* get to it

[Hook 1 - Mos Def]
My people unite and let's all get down
We gotta have what? Love, peace, and understandin'
One god, One love, One light
One aim, One voice, One fight

[Hook 2 - Mos Def]
My people unite, hop up, and do it right
We gotta have what? Love, peace, and understandin'
One god, One love, One light
One aim, One voice, One fight
My people unite, hop up, and do it right
Do it right ya'll, keep it tight ya'll, do it right ya'll, just do it

[Verse 4 - Cappadonna]
Yo, forget police brutality—I work for a salary
And did time for a crime I didn't commit
They tried to beat me in my head, make a brotha submit
Hit me in the face with sticks, lockin' me down for bein' around
I still remember.  Never surrenderin' to the beast
The man, peace for Diallo
My reality is to fight back police brutality

[Verse 5 - Crunch Lo of Othorized F.A.M.]
Mr. Officer got me trapped in a dark corridor
Long hallway, they in love with the gunplay
Swing night sticks, run thicker than Bloods and Crips
Harass mad cats and it don't make sense
Roll around in dark tints, fiend to match fingerprints
Search me down everyday and you still ain't content

[Verse 6 - Rock of Heltah Skeltah]
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Calm your nerves down, bop your heads too high
(Let 'em know, Rock) Stop wonderin' why you keep gettin' knocked
Cause you a part-time dealer, prob'ly a part-time pops
Part-time killer, but them dudes is full-time cops
Pick a hustle, stupid.  You half-*ass* black, act
Stab.  Use your head for more than a hat rack, jack*ass*
Start runnin' your life instead of runnin' the streets
Runnin' your mouth (oh yeah) and stop runnin' from peace

[Hook 1 - Everyone Lead by Mos Def] (x4)
My people unite and let's all get down
We gotta have what?  Love, peace, and understandin'
One god, One love, One light
One aim, One voice, One fight
