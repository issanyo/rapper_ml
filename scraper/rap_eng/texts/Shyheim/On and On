[Verse 1 ]
Nowadays you gots’ ta walk the street and watch your back
Cause brothers with the gats don't be knowin’ how to act
They always pull the Glock when somebody rocks a knot
And if they get shot they often snitch to the cops
Now tell me this ain’t livin foul
She just had a baby child and she’s back to sellin’ cracks vials
On the Ave cause she’s addicted to the fast cash
How long will that last before the cops be up in that ass
But honey-dip dont wanna listen cause she’s in no position
Now nobody gives a pot to piss in
Her life is stuck and filled with bad luck
So she fucks and fucks to earn another buck
She don't really care about pride
And she jumps into another ride then comittin’ suicide

[Hook 2x]
June Luva:
Hey Yo, this goes on and on Shy
Everybody's doin' their own thing
From hookerin' to drug slang (repeat 2)

Verse Two (Shyheim):
Times is gettin' hard, word is bond I swear God
I even got caught tryin' to steal from the junkyard
A born terror, A rebel without a pause
Ain't nevah had a good Christmas so who is Santa Claus
I walk the streets at night with my head down
In this lil’ town you see clowns that wanna be down
So they get a Glock and lick shots to get props
And when shit rocks you can hear when the shells drop
An old man got shot in the parkin' lot
In front of my buildin' I hang with his grandchildren
And for the nigga that pulled the trigga and tried to slide
And hide, but he got knocked by the homicide
And this happens everyday around my way
So I pray that I can live another day

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Shyheim]
Hey Yo, get a load of this guy you know the Mr. Hard-y
He the one who talk about gats but ain't' bustin nobody
He speaks the name game so he can just maintain
I'd blow him out the frame but his mom said he gang bang
But his rep was hi-tech in the projects
Pulled his knuckle-jacks so he got mad respect
The niggas in hoodies packed up their loaded gats
Met up in the back so they could plan the attack
Wasn't hard to tell that these kids was no joke
They let the pistol smoke and at nine was dopin’ and coked
I seen it happen everyday where I live
I know a few brothers, drug dealers, most of them fugitives
