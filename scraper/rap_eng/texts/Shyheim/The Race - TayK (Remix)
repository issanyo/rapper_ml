(Shyheim- Verse 1)

Fuck a beef
Bitch I’m all about my cake
But if you wanna beef
That choppa cook a opp like steak ( cook a opp like steak)
Can’t trust these niggas
They be turning into snakes (nah)
That’s why I keep this .40 and this .38 (that’s why I keep this 40)
Keep 30 rounds
Run up on me i’ma gun you down
Yea they talk a lot of bullshit
But it’s full clips
So ain’t shit said when I come around
Was broke I’m getting money now
Thinking back it’s so funny
How I went from walking in the rain
Scraping up change
But I’m thumbing through them hundreds now
( through them hundreds)
Shout out to CBE that money make em hate (make em hate)
But these niggas change when they get it
I guess that money make em fake (make em fake)
But I just can’t relate
‘Cause none of these niggas ain’t kin to me
Tryna act like a friend to me
But on the low yea you envy me
Cooking up with no recipe (nah)
Working hard so I never sleep (nah)
Ball game my specialty
I keep a tech with me like a referee (uhh huh)
And you can best believe
That I Ball hard never foul out
No Nick Cannon I wild out
Like Tony Romo coming out the game
The way a young nigga bring that nine out

(Shyheim-Verse 2)

But back to this beat
Had to jump on this shit
‘Cause you already know i’ma kill it (you already know)
One thing I learned from my Pops
Never put my trust in none of you niggas (never)
And I’m only riding with my day ones
I don’t fuck around with new niggas (nah)
So if you ever see me riding three deep
I’m probably riding around with two pistols
And ya day ones change up too
So you never know who with you
But it’s RIP to my cousin Trav
‘Cause I do this shit for you nigga (do this shit for you nigga)
