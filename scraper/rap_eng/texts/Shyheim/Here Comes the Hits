Hit after hit makin' MC's quit then they jump on my tip for that old raw hit
You thought I got stuck nah kid you're outta luck
You can bet your best buck that I serve it up
Boom bow, upside your head with the lead, A down low ill type brotha nuff said
You thought I couldn't flip ill style's like this word peep it
Look out for the hit as I freak it, jump all around only if you're outta jam
But yo keep your ground when brothaz get flam
Danger Danger better start runnin search for cover kid the hits comin
Check the technique raw rough and rugged came across mad con but never fronted
Cause they'll be none of that I keeps on comin' back for more
To add more points to the score sound the alarm for destruction iz near
Explosion there ain't no escape from the real
It's hectic, tic, tic tic Boom I flips real quick
Awww shit, here come the hits

Here comes the hits ya'll

Comin out of nowhere with the ill plan of attack
Staten Island comin soon to your map
Better get it and enter the realm of the Wu
Try to front, the kid got by to get you
Hits up to here puttin out mad fear
Then I appear after the smoke clears
Then drop my game on your girl let her know that I'm thorough
I grand slam in every burrow cause I'm on third base throwin ill styles
Bad little bastard aka Rugged Child, next up to pop no one is on second
The nasty one man gang you can't hang so step back cause u ain't
Qualified burn her
Cause u know and I know there's only one son on first, now here comes
The man to clean it up
Here comes the hit now duck, the click we all got props to earn
When its time do ya we all take turns, its my go now
Put on your wool can't quit till im done shut up and sit
Cause here come the hits

Here come the hits ya'll

In case that ya'll ain't done I got a bitch that's illa
First at bat upon Killa, a shorty that holds his own with no problems
All just the cream is quickly I'll solve 'em
With just a little slick slang from my tongue
Or got done by the sword that I brung, the ruckus is with so move back
And clear the way
Peace to "Doe" who couldn't be here today
But this one's bein' sent to you by a crew that's thick
(You know the flav) here come the hits

Here comes the hits ya'll
