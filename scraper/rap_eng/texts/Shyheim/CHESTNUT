Chestnut


[Verse 1]
Sextus to Lucretia to niggas pointing nails up at the youth that’s banging heaters for the shit up in the meters(add adlib after meters)

Ain’t no “good boy” to a boy darker than Okiku, just “oh WELL, Shell”, know that boy evil

Streets showed love though, like Guandisimo to Wanda, when no heart emojis typed by the Cosmos

Fetti got bipolar disorder, like he just outta order, don’t try to treat it, just say fix the nozzle

Bottle up these feelings and I’ll bust on niggas like a carbonation rush

The aqueducts will bust and family don’t say much

Not to mention Oklahoma’s poverty rate, 17 percent ain’t got no cents to keep the leaves raked(add adlib after poverty rate)

He fake, follow trends just like a statistician, he see his homie itching, then he gotta grab the Smith n’

But ain’t thought about his feelings, probably neglected in his home, all alone, need to feel admitted

I feel it, middle school was no Lays with the double ham

More like Charlotte, had me caught up in a web

Picked on everyday, these niggas always tried to catch my fade

Ready to scrap, I had that work like El Tigre

Life ain’t easy, for a young black kiume, that’s why he like arthroscopy, needy(add adlibs after this rhyme)

Not always explicitly, but peeling caps up in the streets, a bag of trail mix that they forgot to eat



[Hook]
Ain’t no table for me cuz I don’t belong
Call me chestnut, call me chestnut
Ain’t no table for me cuz I don’t belong
Call me chestnut, call me chestnut[sings]
Always on the road, tryna make the money long
Call me chestnut, call me chestnut
Always on the road, tryna make the money long
Call me chestnut, call me chestnut
(Add background vocals)




[Verse 2]
Sorry if my mind scatter like I’m Louis Armstrong(oooo wee)

But, that’s how it is when you always feeling weak

Growing up was bleak, I had to fortify IV like iron sheik

Always called a freak, the Son of Sam, was always with the geeks

Crying everyday, but something told me, “keep it lowkey”

Dad always busy, mama back and forth from Boley

Never got to spend a day with Keke in a sauna

First hood nigga who ain’t close to his mama

Fuck that tho, I let the globe gift me with some girls so sunny, the skin need Coppertone

No cameras shown, lotta assets, like bitch, I’m grown, tryna swim in billions like I’m John Malone

Cuz I was raised where the laundry hang from the oak trees, Ramen was our only feast, and had no electricity

Kinda feeling like a batch of eggs catching hands from a whisk, cooked on a skillet, yea, kinda beat

Cousin beat me till I looked like Liv in iZombie, truthfully, that was the threat that forced me in passivity

Said “shut the fuck up”, ‘fore your tears make my tea

Cuz I didn’t clean, man, the cow strolled to the pasture with that

But honestly we all pulled our thatch
