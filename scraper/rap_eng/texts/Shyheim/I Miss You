[Intro: Caniven]
Our father, who art in Heaven, hallowed be thy name
Thy kingdom come, thy will be done on earth as it is in Heaven

[Bucks]
I love this life a whole lot, that's why I just can't stop
I take an L to the end, rememinse on these dots
Spot on the block, where we used to puff our choc'
In the building politicking 'til the Sun made us stop
Spliff building to building, me and the God building
On making the hood, a better place for the children
Got me illing, on how haters come in between
You and ya dreams, my son ain't even see eighteen
What you know about the I.C. Unit
Watching a coma, take away a piece of ya unit
You can't feel how I feel unless you been through it
This ain't the first time, and damn sure won't be the last
That me and my team, gotta feel the streets' wrath
As time pass, mine's pass
And how long before time decide to grab my ass?
And how many times time almost had my ass? But...

[Chorus 2X: female singer]
I look to Heaven
And I know some day that I'll see you
My life without ya
Has been problems, I miss you

[IMF Blue Steele]
Son, I never told you this, but I love you a lot
We spent time on them corners, spent time on them blocks
Wrote rhyme to ya fights, got high in ya hallway
With two mom dueces, left mine in ya hallway
Ya mom's like to people "Y'all get out of my doorway"
We moved, we was oozed off them bottles of O.E
Stood there stuck, trying to get it together
We broke the Dutch but we still tried to put it together
I love you Dutch, I'm still gon' put it together
You left us eartly in the game, they put 'em early in the rain
Ran up on my nigga, put it early in his brain
When I heard, son, it hit me early with the pain
But you know, I survived the wars
Cuz I still got Canive' and Lord, and we gon' ride for sure
But you know, niggas hide they thoughts
They put it in they minds, it's lost
Contend to hurt themself

[Chorus 2X]

[Caniven]
No named boo, my sister's boyfriend
We like kin, well, he was the boss
He gave me packs of crack and told me "Get 'em off"
She found 'im one morn', in the hallway torched
Stretched on the floor, key in the door
Few grand in the pocket, had to be a hit
We all went out, on some avenge you shit
That's when Pop got killed, by accident
Straight shots from his own man, god damn
Now I'm fifteen, five grand, got plans
Get money in Edgemire, Maine, over there
But he got killed, getting high on the stairs
Now we pour out beers, and say word to you
Seen Fatboy and Ty on they way to 42
So I run through Brooklyn, and learn that too
Marco Polo, only love to the Boost
Heard he got wet right in front of the stoop
Low life dude, son was the truth
Paints all creased, p-wing Ming
Smooth Kwan got killed by a dope fiend
That ain't right, I could go all night
Dutch got hit on some Blood, gang bang shit
Son had no kids, feel like I lost my own child, I raised that kid

[Chorus 5X w/ ad-libs]
