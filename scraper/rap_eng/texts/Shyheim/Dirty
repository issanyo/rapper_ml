[IMF Blue Steele]
I don't understand how you did what you did
She lived in ya crib, she did a full bid
Feds are kids, even, bids are kids
And when the NARC's rushed, she cleared ya spid
When shit got dark, she aired ya niggas
True story, Brownstone, but upstairs you lived
And you ain't never tell her 'bout that night you slid
To the East and shot up police with a rifle spread
Then came home, wilding on her like you ahead
Then told ya man, "Don't worry, son, my wife in her bed"
You had 2 mans with you, 82 grams with you
Plus y'all ate at that Jamaican spot right by the figure lot
And y'all ain't give a fuck if it was safe or not
And you only shot the police cuz he heard the shots
And everybody know him, cuz that's Curtis' pops
And everybody know him, cuz he served the block
And they gon' come get you if ya scared or not
Who cares, cuz they gon' come get you if ya scared or not
And now you back home, getting ya act on
Slap on, beating ya wife, ya mans laugh on
And she don't even know about the trouble you into
And she don't even know about the trouble you been to

[Chorus: IMF Blue Steele]
That's dirty, son, you did her dirty
How you gon' live like that?

[Hook 2X: IMF Blue Steele]
You disrespect her shit, neglect her shit
You stress her shit, that's how you live

[Chorus 2: IMF Blue Steele]
And that's dirty, son, you did her dirty
How you gon' live like that?

[Chorus]

[IMF Blue Steele]
Not everything bleaches, y'all took the Kingston to the beaches
Forfeit ya live weekend, the kids with big mama, y'all thought y'all
Was creeping
Got home, and guess who not home?
Big mama 'nore the kids, she got to sort the crib
But nothing never showed, y'all remember that story that's never told?
Stepped in the kitchen, seen the letter on the stove
With a candle lit, embedded with a rose
"This is C4, I got ya kids
Yo I shot my pops for some rocks in the spiz
Disrespectful on the block where I live
I should sell off all ya kids with shots to the wigs
But I ain't even wanna do ya kids that dirty
Cuz I ain't even wanna do ya wiz that dirty
But I ain't gon' worry cuz I got ya moms
So I know I got the faggot-ass right in my palms"
And that's dirty, he got my moms? How you gon' live that that

[Chorus]

[Hook 2X]

[IMF Blue Steele]
"Don't worry", that's what you told ya wife
After, all the time you scold ya wife
Nigga, and Peter, son, you know how you treat her
She took a likkle stare and said "Look up here"
It's her address, you turned and knew it
Same place you shot that cop, on Vern and Lewis
You know it was her time and you burned it through it
Trying to gather up ya thoughts like "How I'm gon' do this?"
Ya wife in ya ear like "How you gon' do this?
Somebody got my kids cuz you killed a cop
If they don't get to kill you, I'ma kill you, watch
And I don't understand after all we been through"
And y'all don't understand, this will all continue...

[Chorus 2X]
