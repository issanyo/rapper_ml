[Bomb Official]
Yo, I be the boss of the bossman, supplying the team
Be the jack of all trades, you can crown me king
Put a stop to ya whole regime, when I step on the scene
They just love it how a gangsta lean
Be my stats, so I wore my hat low, no Fidel Castro
And I ain't talking bout my cash flow
I got coke out the ass, yo
And the mean is green weed, just sprinkle the seeds and watch the grass role
Life in the fast lane, I'm into fast dames
That like doing something strange for a piece of change
Call me propane, cuz I'm known to spit flames
And torture nigga, whether from far or close range

[Chorus 2X: L.E.O.]
Rain, pour, these boys bring thunder
Ya'll slow 'caine with hurricane storms this summer
Look, we the umbrella you under
We the money you re-up, you just a little come up

[Mike Millz]
I done been around the world, seen a lotta shit
Fought alotta niggas, seduced alotta chicks
Did all of my jail time, never did I snitch
Rep the wall wit gem stars, never got a skitch
Off a rep, I warn a nigga, stop the charades
Since my high school days, I been popping the gauge
Went from jump shots to handling the rock, to get paid
Now they wave, cuz I made it from the block to the stage
What a feeling, and it used to be me
Greeted and treated like a star, for tormenting these beats
I walk the streets without a care in the world, that's how I dose it
Even the youngings, admire how I thug it
Got to love it, I went from rubbers to star studded
And on top of all that, I'm well respected by the public
I ain't got a blood or crip tear tat in my face
To prove that the kid match my great, in this bitch

[Chorus 2X]

[L.E.O.]
Fucked up alot of lives, product I sodomize
Coke holla crime, but holla I'm, dollar signs
Out of this grind, out of my mind
Well, not at the time, I stop at the prime
I'll die, know that I try to get chips, know that I ride
Don't cry, just try to get rich bitch
Fuck a cell block, nigga, I bail hop
Gingerbread runaway train, until the rail stop
Now, picture me rolling, bitches burning, snitching
Roast is the work, cuz now I'm pitching the murders
Picture me under the building, gun by the pillar
Nothing but killas, drug dealers, young niggas
Dag, welcome to puff golla, know what the marks know
Talk to the NARC's now, walk through the dark
And see scars of stigmata on his rider
Know that I was marked by the big father, holla

[Chorus 2X]
