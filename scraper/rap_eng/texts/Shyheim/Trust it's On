[Shyheim]
Made my click vanish
Ya'll be co-respeonding
With my niggas in critique attings
I run when the jiggy come, I'm on probation
Can't get caught with another gun, serious buissnes
That's why I never be in one spot for more than 5 minutes!
I'm menace like O-Dog, oh Lord
You will be a body and your man will be a witness
Do it for dolo, shot knees no existance!
If I want my niggas then we co-defendant
One love, one thug till the last love
Made up mad slang when my phone was bugged
You bite so much of mine or high-speak dub
Copy my shit, I'll fuck you up in the club
You can get your doors, Glock a 44
Do you think they stop making guns when they made yours?
27, we get money and break laws, gettin' you sick
We be all up in your porsche

[Hook: Infamous Bluesteele]
Yo, we shoulda blow
Let your guns spark, It's on!
When you see my fam commin' with the rush, It's on!
When we crush, It's On!
When we flush, It's on!
Leave my fam, get the erv, you hit that dust
It's on! We shoulda blew
When you trust, it's on!

[Shyheim]
I'm like Ice Cube, to my shoes I bring it Mack 10
With the death long vest on, more points than an african
You can trust it's on, thats my word is bond
I put that on twin, niggas is broke
They don't bail out, they blood in
Then they blood out when I bring the dog out
Make them call for a loung-out on the concrete
I rock a fellon like Bleek, niggas know me
I think your CD is weak, if the shit ain't in my Jeep
Straight cheese, skinny nigga but I walk like I'm ??
Death to my enemy's...

[Hook]

[Infamous Bluesteele]
When I'll be yellin "blaze dem"!
If you got the razor, chase e'm
If you got the 44 then lift e'm up
Raise e'm, jus't don't come
Bunny back to me, son I grace e'm
Raise e'm, son you better murder the man
We need his body in this soil
So we further the land
You heard of the plan?
Then you know how we rock you
Never grace a nigga, niggas heartpiece stop
And his heart leave not, likely a rush
To leave a nigga leakin' this, slightly touch
I think Mike need the bus cos presically he bust
And he could turn a hardrock, I see the slot
And the mic be the trust, that I gamed before
If Kani got him 'sessed, son it's basically law
Shy says fuck the roof and I'm raising the floor
And my ? don't shit, that's why you praising the lord
(Praising the lord) What?!
(Nigga) (Straight Up)
