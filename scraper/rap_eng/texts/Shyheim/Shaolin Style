Yeah yeah
Where my Shaolin peoples at?
Stapleton, the craziest, y'all know what time it is
Wild wild West
Now born, Killa Hill, port to the Richmond
Jungle Nilz, let's get money y'all

[Verse 1: Shyheim]
It be the Cess and Hennessey that make me act like this
I'm wild hit ‘em up projects style never plead the fifth
Regardless, to the charges, chickenheads will be at court
Fightin’ and slicin’ each other to see who lies at my fort
Who woulda thought, little Shy Big Willie
Ninety-six we rollin dutches, nine-trey it was Phillies
First of the month be like Christmas to dealers
Hundred dollar sales come through the school zone area
Children at play keep the heat on the low
Little kids getting’ hit, projects flooded with po'
Now shorty's rockin’, Versace and Donna Karan
Playin’ the Miss Mob Queen role knowin’ hon the cousin Sharon
I live the glamorous life, girl
To go from limos with Don Perignon, rich hotels

[Hook x4]
M.E.T.H.O.D. Man Sample:
"Wild, the Shaolin Style is all in me
Child, the whole damn isle is callin me"

[Verse Two: Squig]
Facing two-five to life incarcerated activated
Stressed behind a cell with no way to escape it
Holdin’ on, true to ‘ock steel tryin’ to appeal
Be landed without a bail so let the commisary reveal
I feel it's time, for me to let this sparklin' wine
Wet my throat rockin’ the trenchcoat, flashin to get mine
Not hesitant, cause the Henny keeps me bent
Just tryin’ to make a cent, diggin’ pockets down to the lint
Regardless of all the charges the D's want me for
Warrant after warrant, so I avoid the law
Stapleton on the rise, twenty-seven where it lies
From day one until they none don't take it as no surprise

[Hook]

[Verse Three: Shyheim]
I'm havin’ suicidal thoughts cause I'm screwed up in the game
But today's thang, is to hold it down and maintain
I got thirty days until I get remanded for this gun charge
Still I'm livin’ large, joint hard up in the mode and
Sexin', this European model
I'm young black rich and dangerous, livin’ like I won the lotto
So ‘nough of wine sex and dutches
Them kids know who us is
GP Wu, hundred-twenty-seven hustlers
Runnin’ from D's when they try to bust us
Fly crimes and gats, mainly black cops, them faggots love us
And my district attorneys wanna send me to jail
I told em, "People wanna kill me, that's why I had the nine milli’’
I bust ‘em dead and not to injure
Remember what I quote
Before you, enter my center

[Hook repeats until fade]
