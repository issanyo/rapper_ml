"You and me, we can make it last
You and me, must forget the past
You and me, we can make the best, that we have together" -
Sample repeats throughout

[Intro: Shyheim]
Hey baby girl, what's happening?
I know ya looking down on me
Yeah, I finally popped this Bottom Up shit off
(Embassy) Yeah, Blue and 'Nive, they my niggas
You know, it's... everything's going well
You know, I had a little girl, she just called me Dada a little while ago
You know how it go... you know
And I miss you though, for real
Rest in peace...

[Shyheim]
I remember the first time I laid eyes on Tiff
How could I forget? She my baddest bitch
Excuse my French, I mean, lady
And this is the soulmate, ring she gave me
My baby, was one in a million
I reminisce, on the days, it was just us chilling
She was caught up in the game that didn't deal with feelings
They called her dope girl, dope girl
Her dreamhouse was Scarface's, but the globe would say it's her world
We was like twelve, at the beginning of the saga
Rob, was her father, he got murdered in the harbor
When the deal went sour, she hid in the shower
Then moved to Stapleton, to live with her aunt
Cuz her mother O.D.'d with a needle in her arm
I would meet her in the park, we would have these heart to hearts
Until it got dark... and then she died

[Outro: Shyheim]
Shit, man.... that stray bullet fucked my baby face
And head all up, her chest was all leaking (faggot ass)
I was crying, son, that shit it fucked me up
I miss you, girl, yeah, I miss you
The next time a nigga shoot, shoot and aim right, nigga...
