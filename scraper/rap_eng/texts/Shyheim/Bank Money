We walked up in the CitiBank, on a normal business day
Security guard in my way, blew him the fuck away
Everybody on the ground, while my niggas checked the safe
Smacked the bitch with the guage, don't look in my fucking face
Ya'll niggas had me up, already told me it's late
Kill all that greedy shit, we can't take all the cake
Jiggy coming, oh man, fuck the jake
Fuck police, come on, pig, make my day
Get on your radio, go ahead and be brave
Leukemia patient style, get your fucking head shaved
We rushed out the back door, jumped in the black Ford
Money bagging soda, why you grab that last bag for?
Bitch get in the fucking store, I ain't playing with you, son
I shoot you in your fucking cunt, like shit is where the first one
They jumped in the front, I jumped in the back
And we was out like that, for the love of cash

*talking*

[Shyheim]
Blowing down Richmond Terrace, pushing a buck
I'm hanging out the back window, blasting the pump
Screaming out the top of my lungs, nigga, what?
It's gonna take more than ESU, to cuff us
Mad shots in the police car, and so what?
Next day, NY 1 was talking about us
But the picture's they sketched didn't look shit like us
So we laughing got all the cash and, puffing blunts
Oh shit, we forgot the hostage in the trunk
Oh well, it's too late, we burned the whip up
Hey, what can I say? This world is fucked up
DA got no evidence, case closed shut
Feds so embarrased, we been under the rug
Bank robbery money, nigga, brought drugs
Dropped the price on the grams, show the hood love
The more the frost, moving more water than a tub
