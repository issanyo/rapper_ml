Verse One:

I wake up to another day of life and wish I didn't
Cuz my records predicted a future of Bill Clinton
But I continue to do my thang to make a livin
Fuck the police and Judge Brennan cuz I ain't givin in
I'm cops so say the notorious killa
Last seen in the hilla in a black vigga
Smokin' lye with an unidentified man
The feds believe it was a member of the clan
A wild nigga so jiggy better be cautious
Fuck wit Delores Im bringin 50 crime bosses
From BK to Jersey niggas wanna murder me
Ain't nuttin sweet kid they bettah bring their whole army
Fake ass gangstaz pretend to be killaz
End the drama with a slug from the 4-5th for real uh

1 - Makin green for the next man
Money ?strugglin plans for the dividends
Look in my eyes and tell me what you see
(repeat)

Verse Two:

Same shit different day I scheme to make the paper
God dreams of livin large makin niggas steal and rob
Fuck the pleadin Ill leave ya bleedin
If ya take to long deliverin
Dividends, see nigga, Im menances like 8 sharp
Cracks on my moms china plate
Bag 'em up and wait till it gets late and hit the gate
Keep my eyes open cuz po po they be keepin
They tryin to get locked on Friday and spend the weekend
Then on ruckus island adolescents be watchin
So when Im in the four buildin Im hollerin Staten Island
With my ? in my hand like a 4-5th
The first nigga to fake a move is gettin phillied with the quickness
I'm hip to this wild ass game called street life
It's a cut throat BI with mens who live trife
You Squig you my nigga (no doubt to the death)
I got the isle in my right hand so son part in the left
And let's go to war I got a tech and nine and 3 3-80's
Straight from Haiti, Ill turn a nigga into gravy
And fuck the media ? ? put this on the news
Cause its so safe to know the notorious rulz

Repeat 1
