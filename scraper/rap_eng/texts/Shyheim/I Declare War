[Shyheim]
With my x-ray vision
See through you lames for days
Every bullet counts
And we don't bust strays
I pop you in your waves
Leave your shit, spittin'
Hollow heads in your head
Head on head collision
I'm bad news
Extra, extra, read about me
Blowin', stolen
Cops glockin' 197 lobby
My philosophy making niggas think they rockin' me
They can't possibly!
I'm not a suspect, i'm far from that
And that uncontrolled substance
Like crack, cocaine
And Inspectah Deck
I don't know how yall see it
But it clean ya specks
I'm too complex, what you say complex?
I leaved you stressed with a complex
You better stop playin' games
That's the advice I suggest

Chorus 2X:
I walk like I'm at war
Talk like I'm at war
Don't sleep like it ain't war
You speak like it ain't war
Better read the "Art Of War"
Before crossing my lines
You better read the "Art Of War"
Before crossing my lines

[Shyheim]
It ain't over till we even
I even got the life support
Machines just to keep you breathin'
I'm beef increasing, bees in season
You can be my 8 by 10 photo
In the 120 in prison
I'm runnin' to your vision, squeezin'
For no reason, make it so hot
Hot summer, Shyheim should be a season
Be the greatest like Ali Muhamed
We get a million youths to march
Trough New York like I live Muhamed
Predicted platinum by Nostradamus, ya know should dimers
27 conglomerates, we communists
And ghetto richs to the extreme
Devine put the money behind the dreams
Of the microphone fiend
Now rushin' trough your screens...

Chorus 2X

Outro:
Bottom lines...
*Sounds of war*
