Hah, oh word up, this is one of them
Yo let me tell ya son
This one of them gettin dick sucked type tracks
Im tellin you, in the closests or where check it out

Verse One:

What up boo, how life treatin ya girl
Hopefully you're takin care of yourself out in the world
As for me, I'm mainting in this packed hell hole
Hopefully in the year 2000 Big Kane'll be home
My old school crew frontin on me cept for a few
It's a shame that jail had to make me feel the way I do
But it's all good, enough for me what's up wit you
You don't write or come and visit me like you used to
What's the problem huh Why all of a sudden you dissapearin
Now that I need you the most you actin like you don't care and
It hurts my feelins but life must continue
I heard that Big Mark died please don't say this shit is true
If so that's fucked up oh tell my niggas what's up
And don't get caught up in no bullshit and get sicked up
How is my seeds doin I know they're crazy big by now
Tell 'em daddy loves 'em no matter what the fuck goes down
And Love Dark ha, he's a dead man walkin for talkin
To Jiggy Jake I'm puttin him in a coffin
Ay yo I'm vexed so Ima end this little letta
So take care of yourself for worst or for fuckin betta

Are you still there for me baby I need to know
You're one of the only things I got in this whole wide world
You're my whole wide world
(repeat)

Verse Two:

All I do is party and bullshit
Fuck big chicks that's mad thick
Roll through the big city
In BM's and Cruiser Land's
But damn, it ain't the same without my fam
You niggas understand
On New Years I drink beers and bust off heat
I'm in this little street doin by any means to eat
You gotta get up get out and rob suntin
Ha don't let dem niggas with that cream walk by that's right
I be shootin and stabbin, robbin niggas whateva
For gold chains, rings, watches, diamond studs and leathaz
My peoples one love ya'll stay bugged
Don't crimp your style none cause we thugs..foreva

Are you still there for me homiez I need to know
You're really the only thing I got in this whole wide world
You're my whole wide world
(repeat)

(My cousin Tawana, rest in peace girl, you're my whole wide world)

I need somebody there when it's hard kid oh yeah yeah
When they bring the ruckus to me
You're my whole wide world
