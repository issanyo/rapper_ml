[L.E.O.]
I heard the shots, that they just let blow
Word from the hospital, you just let go, Capo
Where you go, why you go, I don't know
I ain't get there yet, but say what up to that nigga O
Rest in peace, O.J., Boobie and Donny
Rest in peace, to my nigga Dush, Crippy and Bobby
Why we, die so violently, and subconsciously
In my mind, the good vs. bad, inside of me
Public apologies, to the mother's that mourn
Over they sons, with no good reason on why they gone
Be strong, the hood is guiding us wrong
They might be dead on my arms, but I give 'em life on the song, live on

[Chorus 2X: L.E.O. (male singer)]
I heard the shots, that they just let blow
Word from the hospital, you just let go, Capo
(I lost niggas and it's thugging, yo, I really love 'em though
The streets'll leave my nigga Capo)

[L.E.O.]
Yeah, to make a friend, just today to lose 'em
Hear they name forever, just today to make this music
But it's fucked up, I wish I never had to make this music
And what's fucked up, too many of us relate to it
Enough's enough, fake nigga, tell you to kill
For something light, while real niggas tell you to chill
Thanks love, I'm far from a saint though, as hard as it on
Regardless of pain, man, it's to thank ya'll
Stand in the paint, ya'll, like this is ball
Understand your man, a young man that understand the arts of war
You shouldn't have start a war, if you gonna call the law
Like you shouldn't start a war for something, all that small

[male singer]
Niggas die, mother's cry, forever miss
They never come back, they gotta thank all that for this, yo
