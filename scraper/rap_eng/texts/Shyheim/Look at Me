[Intro: Shock G sample]
"Yeah, I called you fat, look at me, I'm skinny
It never stopped me from getting busy, I'm a --"

[Shyheim]
Fat boy, I'm back
You thought you'd keep me quiet, putting up two stats
A-hah, gotta laugh at that
A-hah, they all laugh behind your back
Like yo, Shy really called him fat
Everybody acting suprised, like ya'll ain't know that
Like you ain't tell 'em for yourself, how you fiend for crack
Kids don't listen to this dope head, crack is wack
You fall asleep around Rae, you better lay on your back
It be like 4 in the morning, you feeling his tap
He trynna roll you over, but once you wake up
He fronting like he looking for the remote controller
Stop what? I'mma do it again
Til you wearing that same damn 'Lo sweater again
And if he ain't your enemy, you ain't my friend
Come on, dog, you gotta get better hitmen
They ain't rollers, they couldn't out think the spinning rim
They ain't rollers, they couldn't out think the spinning rim

[Chorus: Shock G sample (Shyheim)]
"Yeah, I called you fat, look at me, I'm skinny
It never stopped me from getting busy, I'm a --"
(G-L-A-D-I-A-T-O-R, nigga, ya'll don't want war)
"Yeah, I called you fat, look at me, I'm skinny
It never stopped me from getting busy, I'm a --"
(I'mma G, what? I'mma G, what? I'mma G, what? nigga you already know)

[Shyheim]
I'm seen when I wanna be seen, they say I'm washed up
Yup, punk, I'm zestfully clean
Yah mean, I say what I mean
Shyheim, rhyme what I do, what I've seen
A-hah, this nigga is hilarious
Pumping that garbage-larity, like Immobilarity
That shit was faggoty, you had the Island looking raggity
Change your voice Clyde, be somebody else and battle man
It's just your imagination, you just being glad he made it
Assassinated, now living a different world and Dwayne Wayne it
I say what I wanna, I don't gotta explain it
You call it what you name it, I just call it how you say it
The Staten, ain't no Island for old men
The Bottom where it's rotten, your body'll be rotting when they find it

[Chorus 2.5X]
