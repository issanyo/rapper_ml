[Intro: 12 O'Clock (Sandman)]
Two On Da Road right here
(Uh-huh, somethin for the radio, nigga)
Two On Da Road
Uh, Two On Da Road

[Chorus 2X: *singing*]
When you see me at the party
Homey get at me
And don't be mad
When your girl try and spit at me
Cuz when the beat
Got doo-doo-doo-doo-doo
It ain't no limit to the things that we can do

[12 O'Clock]
I'm at the bar, Long Island Iced Tea
Double shot of Hennessey
For this pretty piece
With pretty feet smellin like Victoria Sec'
I could see her bra and panties were pink
Lookin Spanish or Greek
Finest thing I seen all week
Movin with her cousin and niece
I'm movin with my mans Monk and P
Stayin at the Waldorf, Room 3-3-3
Pussy for free like ODB
High off the eves
Bitches lookin like Pamela Lee
Butt-naked on their hands and knees
Roll up the trees
Burn somethin 'fore we leave
Give your friend your car keys
Slide with me

[Shyheim]
Peace
Hey vagina, my name Davey Crocket
I'm king of the wild frontier, your sex hostage
MMMMM..
Mr. Lover-man, what's cookin good lookin?
Let's jump in the fryin pan
Fuck yo' man
He don't want it with us killas
With E-40 Skrilla
For real-a

[Doc Doom]
Pop a bottle for the Wu years
And I'ma hit the flo' after a few beers
Tell the DJ the Black Knights is up in here
Wu-Tang is in here
The whole Killa Bee Gang is in here
And ladies holla when we in here
Cuz they know it's Big Pimpin
Goin on in here
And in the VIP, ho's take it off in here
So get at me
Cuz I know you wanna spit at me
And I'd be a fool
To let that phat ass pass me

[Shyheim]
You wanna ride in the 600 BAAA-BAAAY
With your head out the window like "HEY HEY"
Tell everybody in the hood you my LAAA-DAAAY
We pimpin' for life so you crazy

[Prodical]
This killa dog
Puffin green danny
Ready to sink through some panties
Caught some eye candy
Sippin on Coke mixed with Brandy
--Yo Monk--
Shorty got a lot of junk in her trunk
Bouncer surfin through the crowd
For our weed that's skunk
My nigga 12
Rockin treasures like the jewels of the nile
Twenty-seven, ManChild
From the Isle of Shaolin
We sky Sushi bar, Meoshi par, chronic cigars
And the ladies in the place
Wanna know who we are
Gumah Oz Dubar
My hand all in her bra So what's the deal ma'?
Can me and my Clan Bar Mitzvah?
Call your girlfriends, after-party
House on the hill
Come if you will, she said "I'm burnin hot off the pill"
Drinks for free, I got my own VIP
Two or three
Or it can be just you and me
Let's get it on and poppin
Crack-a-latin with no debatin
No time for the fakin, baby girl what's shakin?

[Monk]
Catch Monk
In the midst of party crackin
Don't dance
But I boogie to the beat low key
I stay splashin
Drunk still drinkin, poppin major with the ho's
I'm groovin
With this bad bitch
She stuck by my slang and my dress code
I got close, whispered
"What's up with the Bar Mitzvah?"
Then I grabbed her ass, she laughed
With a porno look
Then pussy popped her ass
On rhythm with the beat
"replied
She with her man
But her friends came two cars deep"

[Chorus 6X]
When you see me at the party
Homey get at me
And don't be mad
When your girl try and spit at me
Cuz when the beat
Got doo-doo-doo-doo-doo
It ain't no limit to the things that we can do
When you see me at the party
Homey get at me
And don't be mad
When your girl try and spit at me
Cuz when the beat
Got doo-doo-doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo-doo-doo
When you see me at the party
Homey get at me
And don't be mad
When your girl try and spit at me
Cuz when the beat
Got doo-doo-doo-doo-doo
It ain't no limit to the things that we can do
