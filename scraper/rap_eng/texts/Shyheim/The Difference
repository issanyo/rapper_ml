[Intro: Caniven]
Oh, the d-i-fference, Caniven
Bottom Up, Rahmaddan, I want in
I'm in, in...

[Caniven]
From sun up to sun down, I'm known to bust rounds
T-top Coupes, spin out and rush towns
Leaders of the dust now, dare a nigga fuck 'round
Play like you fire, get clipped like a bust down
Gave these niggas 'nough pounds, no more love
And I gave these niggas 'nough time, no more drugs
You ain't had the proper respect to switch up, cuz
Keep playing cuz it's crunch time, you still on dubs?
Better show 'em that it's lunch time, dare y'all grub
Better show 'em that I bust mines, here y'all slugs
That's what ya chest'll say when I raise the A.R. hub
Put the I in the middle cuz I air them out
When I come around, start to hand it out
And when we stare down, you could tear and pout
That's how it go ba' bro, this is my hometown
Where they double up, flip and, bubble up quick, and
Know they dead wrong, and, take it to trial
And I don't give a fuck, the whole city is, wild
And when I say that, my nigga, gimme a pound
But I ain't talking 'bout a handshake, fifth'll make ya hand break
Clap him 'til he pepperseed, laughing when he Harlem Shake
You get hit from far away, baby boy, we far from cake, cake
Wait for a minute, it's attack on you bitches
You would stagger on my pivots
Seem to hate, the hate for you niggas
But the cake here now, it ain't safe year round
Yes, fresh, in my Maury's and Guess
Cardier specs, bracelets, Princess gets
And you loose nuts front, I'ma tighten 'em up
Lighten 'em up, fuck around, dyking 'em up
When he lifting up his shirt, he see that diaper mush

[Chorus 2X: 5 Mics and Caniven]
I heard y'all niggas, after eating, and y'all getting y'all grind up
It's Rahmaddan now, mothafucka, ya time's up
Them icy-ass chains, you don't wanna remind us
Don't get lined up, nigga, rewind us

[IMF Blue Steele]
In the middle of the night, I fiddle with ya life
Hit you with that white, have you whistle through a pipe
Listen, this is right, that is what is wrong
You get a little ice, wanna brag it on the song
Faggot, get a thong, you will never score
I'm straight to that basket, faster than LeBron
Or skip to my Lou, I skip to my Lou
Wan' flip? I spit hollow tips through ya goose
Hollow tips through ya braids, hollow tips through ya waves
Hollow tips through afros, Gumby's or fades
Lot of pricks and assholes, they want me to fade
Lot of pricks and assholes, they want me to graze
When I'm straight for ya face or straight for ya legs
Anything to slow you down, and make sure you beg
Like, "Please, son, it's not that serious"
Now ya ass should've known, kid is shot, that's serious

[Chorus]
