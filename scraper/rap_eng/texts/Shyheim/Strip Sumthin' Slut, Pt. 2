[Intro: Shyheim (girl)]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, Shyheim
Uh-huh, Bottom Up, yeah (Bottom Up)

[Chorus 2X: Shyheim (girl)]
Strip something slut, strip something slut
Strip something slut (pull ya money out, trick)

[Hook 3X: Shyheim]
It's Bottom Up and we wanna fuck
And if you feeling like us, say "strip something slut"

[Chorus 2X]

[Shyheim]
Can you slide down a pole quicker than a fireman?
And, clap ya ass like ya fucking hands?
Then, I'll take my money out my rubber bands
And, if it's really good, I'll take another dance
To watch her...

[Chorus 2X]

[Hook 2X]

[Chorus 2X]

[Shyheim]
A.C., D.C., N.C., S.C
I've seen more chicken strips than K.F.C
N.Y., N.J., L.A., V.A
P.A., A.T.L., won't ya...

[Chorus 2X]

[Hook 2X]

[Shyheim]
Big girls tried to squash me
But I think with my dick, so baby, come and brainwash me

[Chorus]

[Shyheim]
Tick, tock, tock, tick
Look at these hoes all over my dick
Drip, drop, drop, drip
Hoes be talking shit but steadily gobbling dick

[Chorus 2X]

[Girl]
Pull ya money out, trick (3X)

[Shyheim (girl)]
Strip something slut (pull ya money out, trick
Pull ya money out, trick)

[Hook 2 2X: Shyheim (girl)]
Strip something slut
(Pull ya money out, trick, pull ya money out, trick
Pull ya money out, trick)

[Shyheim]
Strip something slut

[Hook 2X]

[Shyheim (girl)]
Strip something slut (pull ya money out, trick)
Strip something slut (pull ya money out, trick)
Shit, I gotta dollars if you wanna holla... get at me!
