See it in your eyes you can't lie you know you want me
Give me a little time, Ill make you change your mind
Im ready if you will so baby let's chill

Verse One:

Settlin' down is the last thing on my mind honey
No time to be all lovey dovey gotta make this moeny
So I can get my thug on and pimp the world
Shorty just hold on and Ima put you in girl
You're mad sweet and plus you look good like a mutha fucka
But Ima playa and not just a one woman lova
I'm all about skins, diamonds and G notes
I ain't tryin to hit dis one girl now but you never know

Yeah ok but I wanna have your love tonight
And ya know that I'm gonna do you right
I know that romance just ain't a thang
But if you give me time we can do this ?here this way

But is this the lifestyle you wanna live love
In a game with only two ways to get up at 'em
Dead or in jail and I ain't tryin ta see neitha
Proceed to smoke the reefer hold on tight to your heata
Make me a believa, that what you're sayin is sane G
