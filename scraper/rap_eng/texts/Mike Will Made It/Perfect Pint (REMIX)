Verse 1:
Said I'm from that part of town, they sell more than weed, It's a guarantee
Getting jumped only thing coming free
Nothing ever said will ever save me
Cause this molly in my drink is so amazing
This joint up to my lips It's got me crazy
With the pad out, and the beat on
Only thing we could ever agree on
Is your girls head homie please be gone
You could never compete on a track
Never see me on a rap
All these mouths they like to gab
All these kids is talking crap
Saying how they slang dope,bitches, waving a gat
But don't talk shit without six homies behind they back..
