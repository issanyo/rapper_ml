[Hook]
They hopin' we live young and die fast
They feel we take over the game
Feel we take over the game

[Verse 1]
I bought her Dior and poodles
I put the shrimp in the noodles
I gave you love like a guru
I seen the whale in the wave
We laugh at you niggas and fuck your bitches
We don't know how to behave
We been so viciously trained
I've seen the gift in the game and the curse
I watch that pussy get wet in a 'vert
We can flow through the hood like you drivin' a hearse
All this shit peaches and cream
I ride the B with the wings
Put a few of them B's in the ring
You deserve to get treated like a queen
Don't let this shit go to your head
Don't let the dick go to your head
Sippin' purp, I don't fuck with the red
She want titties? I bought her some breasts
I pray it don't go to your head
I pray it don't go to your head
Can't forget about my bitch on the side
I tell Uber to give her a ride
Popped the cruiser, I'm back in the skies
Maneuver the streets with my guys
The money didn't come in disguise
They thought it all came overnight
I flood out my neck with some diamonds
I gotta thank God for this life
Too many malicious suspicious bitches
Got a hell of a vision, I need some Ritalin
Got that kush in my cataracts, ask my dentist
I got them golds and the permanent, yeah

[Hook]
Whole lotta guap on me, got a whole lotta guap on me
Don't hold your nuts on me, don't hold your nuts on me
Got a whole lotta guap on me, got a whole lotta guap on me
That bitch gon' fuck for free, that bitch gon' fuck for free
Whole lotta guap on me, got a whole lotta guap on me
Don't hold your nuts on me, don't hold your nuts on me
Got a whole lotta guap on me, got a whole lotta guap on me
That bitch gon' fuck for free, that bitch gon' fuck for free

[Verse 2]
She know the culture
She know I'm flier than a poster
She know I ride with the toaster
I have a work on my line with them boulders
I'm makin' my quota
I sip out the soda
I trip off the soda
I live for the dodie
Get worshipped like Moses
Heavenly sent from the crew are my niggas
I'm liftin' my niggas, I love the young niggas
Wrote on your sneakers young nigga
Servin' illegal my nigga
Duckin' them people my nigga
Smokin' my reefer my nigga
We get to grindin' and makin' these moves on these niggas
Nothin' to prove to these niggas
Just schoolin' these niggas, we tutor these niggas
Fuck on that bitch and her friend like there's two of me nigga
They thick and they bi, got me two on me nigga
The tool on me nigga
They suckin' me that mean they chewin' me nigga
I put them bezels in Jesus face
Got this yellow bitch look just like Lisa Ray
Hatin' on me and I go and fuck Lisa Ray
You niggas always wanna imitate
Take your bitches out on dinner dates
I get some head on the interstate, ay

[Hook]
Whole lotta guap on me, got a whole lotta guap on me
Don't hold your nuts on me, don't hold your nuts on me
Got a whole lotta guap on me, got a whole lotta guap on me
That bitch gon' fuck for free, that bitch gon' fuck for free
Whole lotta guap on me, got a whole lotta guap on me
Don't hold your nuts on me, don't hold your nuts on me
Got a whole lotta guap on me, got a whole lotta guap on me
That bitch gon' fuck for free, that bitch gon' fuck for free
