[Hook:] (x2)
Tity Boi back, Louie bandana
Tall ass nigga look like I play for Atlanta
Look at my whip, it 2011
Look at my watch, this shit so bright that it's yellin

[Verse 1:]
I'm a a problem like arithmetic
Still won't show a bitch shit but dick, yeah
I have sex with my necklace on
By the time breakfast done I'll extra gone, yeah
Niggas know I got a special flow
When they come to the crib they leave their shoes at the door, oh
Tity Boi they call me deuce for short
I just had an accident now I'm on Kush support
If I say it then I did it, I did it then I mean it
This is not a hand me down when I give niggas the bizness
2 black cars on 24 inches
That's my first 48 I'm killing these niggas

[Hook] (x2)

[Outro:]
Yeah, 2 Chainz, ya feel me, it's gonna be a hot summer man

Burn you niggas, bow bow, ya feel me
No guarana either nigga
