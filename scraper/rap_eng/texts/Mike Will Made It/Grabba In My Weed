[Verse 1]
High grade smoking everywhere
Babylon a come but we no care
To rawtid, me one spliff done now
Haffi get back some kush, someway somehow
Nah go ever see me inna no coke zone
Me love high grade weh home grown
If you nuh have no kush and you waan buy it

[Bridge]
Grabba in my weed
No carry no seed
Make mi eyes a bleed
That a weh me need, me want
So gimme my light, pass my light

[Chorus]
And we can't stop, chalice load back
Coke head can't ask me fi no light
Unuh too bloodclaat fucking bright!
We can't stop, chalice load back
Non-smokers can't 'par with we
Excuse me, make me light my weed

[Hook]
Kush inna wrizzla, me smoke when me want

[Verse 2]
Day no pass when me no go check Kiki
The way me regular, him give me weed free
So anytime me step in the party
We haffi have a pass fi rap up from Archie

Spliff long 'til it a bend like elbow
Bwoy try give me bush weed, me say. "hell no"

[Bridge]
Grabba in my weed

Unuh too bloodclaat fucking bright!
We can't stop, chalice load back
Non-smokers can't 'par with we
Excuse me, make me light my weed
