[Hook: Gucci Mane]
You betta not lose that load
Don't lose that load
Don't lose that load
You betta not lose that load
Nigga I got blow
And I sell dope
I know El Chapo
I cannot lose no load
You betta not lose no load (x4)

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
They say 10 a key
Tennessee, shit I wanna see
Gucci Mane you know I got the D
I'mma hit the D
Thousand pints I copped them in the D
Come and shop with me
Gucci Mane or Gucci call me Guwop
Nigga 1 and 3
Raised with the fiends and the crackhead queens
It's funny how the J's keep J's on my feet
I learned to make the money the money can't make me
Got no money and no powder your ass up shit creek
They call me barbershop Guwop cause all I do is cut the top
[?] diamonds should have shopped with the Wop
Shoulda kept it hood with me but you done shopped with a cop
All these blocks, hit the spot look like I'm signed to the Roc

[Hook: Gucci Mane]
You betta not lose that load
Don't lose that load
Don't lose that load
You betta not lose that load
Nigga I got blow
And I sell dope
I know El Chapo
I cannot lose no load
You betta not lose no load (x4)

[Verse 2: Chief Keef]
Aye
I ain't gonna lie, I lost the load
Fucking with the cops I was selling blows
Look at me now, look how I was
I'm Chief Keef bitch I gotta bust
Smoking dope with my fellas
And we getting fucking cheddar
From the block we still tote Berettas
Berettas rip through your damn leather
Sending bullets like letters
Up bitch like a ladder
Fly like feathers
Iâ€™m a machete bitch, I move my cheddar

[Hook]
You betta not lose that load
Don't lose that load
Don't lose that load
You betta not lose that load
Nigga I got blow
And I sell dope
I know El Chapo
I cannot lose no load
You betta not lose no load (x4)
