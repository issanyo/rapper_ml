All I rap 'bout nigga
G-shoe, trapshit, money
Finessing
Damn, it's goat shit, nigga

Brand-new money

That's all I think about, ha!

[Verse 1]
Hop up out the whip
Fresh than a bitch
Know a nigga rich
Ferragamo, bitch
I - done?
Broke? My wrist
I - done? Smashed - yo' bitch!
700 for my robbins, it's tragic
Making all these pints and some pill, like a nigga knows magic
They get it, they get it, they get it, they get it
Young nigga got money
Whippin', flippin' in the sunny
Wrapping the bricks up like a mummy
Bullets ripping through your Tommy
All I think about is that money

That's all I think about
That's all I think about, swag!

[Verse 2]
You niggas swag
You driving cactus, sipping on actis
I'm sippin' on Actavis
Rich Gang, my wrist and
My ice on my neck, and my ice on my neck, and I ride on a jet
Young Soulja, Young Soulja, Young Soulja, I flex... finesse!
Runnin' my check up
I need a check up
I'm sick
My ice on my wrist, they pissed, the diamonds, the shit
Rich Gang is my clique
I'm riding the 'Rari, I holla tomorrow, I sending the shit in them hollows
[?]
We sparkle
Bells tomorrow
Whippin', flippin' with my hands
Takin' a trip to Japan
Hella money in my hands
Tonetos just like I'm a fan
[?]
Your girl, she say I'm the man
Michael Jordan [?]
Mixing the white with the tan
Plenty pistols in my hand
Pocket rocket murk your man
Flying the dope to the pan
Ready they say I'm on fire, man
Slangin' the world like I'm Spider-Man
Smoking on kush, I get higher, man, I think I can't get no higher, man
[?]
Bluetooth, I can use no wire man
Riding the Forgiatos on my tyre man

[Hook]

That's all I think about
That's all I think hell-a-bands!

That's all I think about
That's all I think about
That's all I think about, swag!
