[Chorus]
I forgive you
I ain't 'bout that shit, so I forgive you
It's too late to switch, so I forgive you
It ain't 'bout that bitch, so I forgive you, but I'll forget you
I forgive you
I ain't 'bout that shit, so I forgive you
It's too late to switch, so I forgive you
It ain't 'bout that bitch, so I forgive you, but I'll forget you

[Verse]
I didn't mean all the shit I said
But it's better than what's going on in my head
How dare you bring another chick in our bed
You’re lucky I’m doing my yoga, or you might be dead
I ain’t doin nothing that could take away my zen
Gave you another chance and then you fucked it up again
Life’s a bunch of tests, and we all just do our best
Searching for something outside ourselves to bring us happiness, yes

[Chorus]
I forgive you
I ain't 'bout that shit, so I forgive you
It's too late to switch, so I forgive you
It ain't 'bout that bitch, so I forgive you, but I'll forget you
I forgive you
I ain't 'bout that shit, so I forgive you
It's too late to switch, so I forgive you
It ain't 'bout that bitch, so I forgive you, but I'll forget you

[Bridge]
You and I dont know what goes on for us
If we leave through the stars, we’ll both know what’s aligned for us

[Chorus]
I forgive you
I ain't 'bout that shit, so I forgive you
It's too late to switch, so I forgive you
It ain't 'bout that bitch, so I forgive you, but I'll forget you
I forgive you
I ain't 'bout that shit, so I forgive you
It's too late to switch, so I forgive you
It ain't 'bout that bitch, so I forgive you, but I'll forget you

[Outro]
Forgive you, but I'll forget you
I'll forgive you
