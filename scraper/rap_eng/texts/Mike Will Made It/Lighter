[Chorus]
When we're driving, you're saying "go faster"
And when we're singing to the radio, you're saying "make it louder"
And you roll another one
You wanna get higher
And when I need the fire, you're always my lighter

[Verse 1]
When we're rolling, you always put your feet on mine
And when I’m running late, you always remind me of the time
When I'm feeling low, you lift me to the moon and back
Back into your arms
I won't let go until I know how much you really love me, baby

[Interlude]
I see a light

[Verse 2]
And I've heard we never truly see ourselves
You gotta leave it up to someone else to know how beautiful you really are, baby
We never get to see ourselves sleeping peacefully next to the ones that we love
We never see us cry, when someone dies, they see us crying
Someone new was born, baby

[Chorus]
When we're driving, you're saying "go faster"
And when we're singing to the radio, you're saying "turn it louder"
And you roll another one
You wanna get higher
And when I need the fire, you're always my lighter

[Bridge]
I see a light coming towards me
Moving slowly, but coming quickly at the same time
I think it represents what's going on in my mind
When we're together, everything's so sweet
Nowhere in the world I’d rather be
As long as I got you, and you got me, baby
I could leave here
I don’t need nothing but you
You’re starting out beyond just us two
Forever gets complicated, but it don’t have to be that way, baby

[Outro]
I see a light coming towards me
Moving slowly, but coming quickly at the same time
I think it represents what's going on in my mind
What's going on in my mind
I think it represents what's going on in my mind
What's going on in my mind
I think it represents what's going on in my mind
What's going on in my mind
