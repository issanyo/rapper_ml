[Intro: Ciara & Future]
You go
Do you go?
Where you go?
Go go go yea
Where you go go go go go go go
Where you go?
Where you go?
Where you go?

[Hook: Future & Ciara]
It was time when I seen you happy
Where you go?
It’s been a minute since I’ve seen you smile
Yea
Where you go?
Where you go-o-o-o?
Where you go?
Where you go?
Where you go-o-o-o?
Where you go?
Where you go?

[Verse: Ciara]
There’s a light in the sky
It was brightened by your face
I could see it in your eyes
Then it went right away
Yea

So don’t hold your feelings in
You can trust me as a friend
Whatever you need to make it right
I’mma be standing right by your side

[Pre-Hook: Ciara]
My love it goes on and on on
Every single night and day
I’mma be here for you on and on on
Baby can you tell me? (Tell me)
Where you go?

[Hook]

[Verse: Ciara]
Don't wanna see, don't wanna cry, don't wanna hurt no more
Don’t have no fear, I got that cure, baby my love is pure
I need you now now now (I need you)
I’m stayin down down down

[Pre-Hook: Ciara]
On and on on
Every single night and day
I’mma be here for you on and on on
Baby can you tell me? (Tell me)
Where you go?

[Hook]
