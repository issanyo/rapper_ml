[Intro: Trey Songz & Juicy J]
Trigga
Your boy Juicy J, yeah
Y'all know what it is
Better hide your girl, mane, we lookin' for a broad

[Chorus: Trey Songz]
I ain't the type of nigga thinking 'bout relationships
I be on that late night shit
They going crazy for the DJ when he play the shit
They be on that late night shit
One o'clock, two o'clock, three o'clock, four
Five o'clock, six o'clock, you can hit your boy
If you ain't the type of bitch talking 'bout relationships
Hit me up, hit me up on that late night shit
On that late night shit, on that late night shit
Hit me up, hit me up on that late night shit
We on that, on that late night shit
We on that, on that late night shit, we on that
Hit me up, hit me up on that late night shit

[Verse 1: Trey Songz]
Is this all for me? It's finna be a great night
A lot of fish in the sea, I'm feelin' like a great white
Girl, you got a face like oh, oh
Might wanna see you in the daytime, oh, oh
If the money don't sleep, I ain't tryna close my eyes for a second
You come first, I come second
'Bout to give you this blessin', finna teach you this lesson
Get you out of that dress and I don't know nothin' 'bout affection

[Pre-Chorus: Trey Songz]
What's up? If you wanna spend some time
Baby, you know when the club is over, over
I'ma let you know ahead of time
Baby, I

[Chorus: Trey Songz]
I ain't the type of nigga thinking 'bout relationships
I be on that late night shit
They going crazy for the DJ when he play the shit
They be on that late night shit
One o'clock, two o'clock, three o'clock, four
Five o'clock, six o'clock, you can hit your boy
If you ain't the type of bitch talking 'bout relationships
Hit me up, hit me up on that late night shit
On that late night shit, on that late night shit
Hit me up, hit me up on that late night shit
We on that, on that late night shit
We on that, on that late night shit, we on that
Hit me up, hit me up on that late night shit

[Verse 2: Juicy J]
I'm a dog so gon' let a dog bone
One night stand, you wake up, I'm long gone
Girl, quit playin', Juicy J can't be your man
No discussion, weâ€™re strictly fuckin' then toss you with the band
She ratchet, Dirty Diana, doin' anythin' to get on that camera
Screenshot tryna get her Instagram up
On the internet gettin' niggas jammed up
Know your type, the only thing I'm spendin' with you is the night
Turn you on it and if the face lookin' right I might hit it twice
Drill the chick after the club and then I sent her back
Might as well work at Lids the way she give me cap
She throwin' that like a quarterback
Call me Warren Sapp, I tackle that
Hit me when I'm in your town, I'm smashin' that

[Chorus: Trey Songz]
I ain't the type of nigga thinking 'bout relationships
I be on that late night shit
They going crazy for the DJ when he play the shit
They be on that late night shit
One o'clock, two o'clock, three o'clock, four
Five o'clock, six o'clock, you can hit your boy
If you ain't the type of bitch talking 'bout relationships
Hit me up, hit me up on that late night shit
On that late night shit, on that late night shit
Hit me up, hit me up on that late night shit
We on that, on that late night shit
We on that, on that late night shit, we on that
Hit me up, hit me up on that late night shit

[Verse 3: Trey Songz]
Hit a nigga up if you 'bout that life
Let's get fucked up, yeah, bring your girls
Endin' up on that tub, but for now we on this club
My hands all on your butt, you grabbin' all on my what?
She can say, she can say, baby let 'em talk about it
You know like I know that they don't know about us
You know like I know you wanna give me all love
You know like I know so baby tell me what's up?

[Pre-Chorus: Trey Songz]
What's up? If you wanna spend some time
Baby, you know when the club is over, over
I'ma let you know ahead of time
Baby, I

[Chorus: Trey Songz]
I ain't the type of nigga thinking 'bout relationships
I be on that late night shit
They going crazy for the DJ when he play the shit
They be on that late night shit
One o'clock, two o'clock, three o'clock, four
Five o'clock, six o'clock, you can hit your boy
If you ain't the type of bitch talking 'bout relationships
Hit me up, hit me up on that late night shit
On that late night shit, on that late night shit
Hit me up, hit me up on that late night shit
We on that, on that late night shit

Hit me up, hit me up on that late night shit
