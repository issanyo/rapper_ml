I don't know your name cause I fuck new bitches everyday
Hoe, I don't remember your face
Identify yourself, I can't go to sleep unless my pistol on the shelf
I can't fuck that bitch 'less I got a rubber on
All these percs got me feelin on myself
All this work, ain't shit for the low
Hell nah nigga I ain't givin no deals
