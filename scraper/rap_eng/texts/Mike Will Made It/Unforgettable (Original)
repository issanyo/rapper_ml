[Chorus: Swae Lee]
It's not good enough for me, since I been with you
It's not gonna work for you, nobody can equal me
I'm gonna sip on this drink, when I'm fucked up
I should know how to pick up
I'm gonna catch the rhythm while she push up against me
Oh, was she tipsy
I had enough convo for 24
I peep'd you from across the room
Pretty little body, dancing like GoGo, aye
But you are unforgettable
I need to get you alone
Why not?
A fucking good time, never hurt nobody
I got a little drink but it's not Bacardi
If you loved your girl then I'm so, so sorry
I got to give it to her like we in a marriage
Oh, like we in a hurry
No, no I won't tell nobody
You're on your level too
Tryna do what lovers--

[Verse 1: French Montana]
Feelin' like I'm fresh out, Boosie
If they want the drama, got the Uzi
Ship the whole crew to the cruise ship
Doin' shit you don't even see in movies
Ride with me, ride with me, boss
I got a hard head but her ass soft
She want the last name with the ring on it
'Cause I pulled out a million cash, told her plank on it

[Bridge: Jeremih]
You are unforgettable
I wanna get you alone
Now you wanna chose
Just pop the bubbly in the 'cuzi

[Chorus: Swae Lee]
It's not good enough for me, since I been with you
I'm gonna sip on this drink, when I'm fucked up
I should know how to pick up
I'm gonna catch the rhythm while she push up against me
Oh, was she tipsy
I had enough convo for 24
I peep'd you from across the room
Pretty little body, dancing like GoGo
But you are unforgettable
I need to get you alone
Why not?
A fucking good time, never hurt nobody
I got a little drink but it's not Bacardi
If you loved your girl then I'm so, so sorry
I got to give it to her like we in a marriage
Oh, like we in a hurry
No, no I won't tell nobody
You're on your level too
Tryna do what lovers--

[Verse 2: French Montana (& Jeremih)]
Oh oh, You ain't enough for me
Too much for you alone
Baby go and grab some bad bitches, bring em home
Know the jet's on me
I'ma curve my best for you
You don't know, so pick up that dress for me
You rest on me
Too much convo 24 hours
When you stand next to 24 karats
She left her man at home
She don't love him no more
I want your mind and your body
Don't mind nobody (heyyyyy)
So as long you never hurt nobody (body)
Baby girl work your body (body)
Work your body (ooooohh..)

[Chorus: Swae Lee]
It's not good enough for me, since I been with you
I'm gonna sip on this drink, when I'm fucked up
I should know how to pick up
I'm gonna catch the rhythm while she push up against me
Oh, was she tipsy
I had enough convo for 24
I peep'd you from across the room
Pretty little body, dancing like GoGo
But you are unforgettable
I need to get you alone
Why not?
A fucking good time, never hurt nobody
I got a little drink but it's not Bacardi
If you loved your girl then I'm so, so sorry
I got to give it to her like we in a marriage
Oh, like we in a hurry
No, no I won't tell nobody
You're on your level too
Tryna do what lovers--

[Verse 3: French Montana (& Jeremih)]
Aye, 'cause enough can't be enough
Your man ain't the plug, baby he a dub
Drink, smoke, gettin' high
Baby put your panties to the side
On the blue dot gettin' loose
Hit it doggystyle on the Gin and Juice
Sneak up from behind
What's your name, what's your sign? (heyy..)
We can make back money
Can't make back the time (aye..)

[Outro: Swae Lee]
Drug me
I'm smoking, blowing O's, and feeling stars
Getting so high off my supply
I do it so easy, I don't try
Can't you see yourself...
