Loud money
Macho money
Stunt money
Show money
Blow money
Dough money
Your money
No money

[Verse 1: Curren$y]
I do my thing in the booth, the streets know
You hear my chains in the booth, I wear my gold
We pull up front of your bitch, lift up them doors
She all about that jet life so fuck yours
These bitches know I’m stoned anywhere I go
And when ain't coming in if we can’t smoke
Fuck your rules, I’m too cool for that, bro
I buy the building, throw you out the back door
Carlito shouldn’t have let Benny Blanco go
Cause everywhere you turn they coming for your throat
That’s why I keep my circle tight, jet lifers in the cypher
Bending corners, breaking bitches, making dough
Coming up

[Verse 2: Juvenile]
Dope money, that’s paperweight
Loose leaf my paper straight
C-notes and they face to face
China nigga, no paper plates
Silver back we’re not silver spoon
Business man but I’m still a goon
I’m rolling, nigga, like wheelbarrows
Y’all joke niggas like Will Ferrells
My money stupid like Lil' Darryl
Y’all bank account is getting real narrow
I fuck the deal, up and run at night
Vampire on that life
And I know you hate my guts, woa'
Cause I got everything you want in life
Waking up and I’m counting up
Cause that mula start my morning rite
Well my morning right and my evening good
When my evening good then my family eating
My family, get sanity
That sanity is that man to me
And that man to me know what he said to me
Man as me and no damage me
I don’t plan to leave and no baggage either
Nigga didn’t give no bands to me
I’ve got

Some mike will made it
Fore mike will made it
My middle name mike
Like mike I'm fading

Away for three
Off the easter pink drink
Some booms lucy leaf
Plus green and dmt

Even a few more
But sadly i know
Ya momma bon hear this
And pick up her phone

Alone in the woods
Under the moon
That cancels out more
Than half of the room

My heart pounding
My voice even louder
But not loud enough
To get through to my uncle

Now I'm in my den
Bout to watch a film
I was the main role
But its different on drugs
