[Intro: Tag]
Better check your resource...

[Chorus: B.A. The Great]
I'm just seeing niggas talking (mhmm)
Loose lippin’, (mhmm)
Double cuppin' (mhmm)
Mud sippin' (mhmm)
My niggas stomach growl, (mhmm)
Like they ain’t had dinner (mhmm)
Young educated nigga sellin' dope, nigga, ridin' and roamin'
(Let me paint this picture)

[Verse 1: B.A. The Great]
Pay a brick for a sentence, and a whip that's tinted
Got finesse here, I don't live it
Fuck the dope, I'm chemist
In the pot, I'm a menace
I got pull like a dentist
Get the money, [?] the winners
Live my life without the limits
Since I started rappin’, started trappin, nigga
Yeah, you pussy niggas finished
I’m sorta like the closest to the Western Union
I get my money in a minute
You nigga gon' stop with the gimicks
I’m going [?] and against it
Fake rappers only rapping fake shit
I'ma go down as the realest

[2x Chorus: B.A. The Great]
I'm just seeing niggas talking (mhmm)
Loose lippin', (mhmm)
Double cuppin’ (mhmm)
Mud sippin' (mhmm)
My niggas stomach growl, (mhmm)
Like they ain't had dinner (mhmm)
Young educated nigga sellin' dope, nigga, ridin' and roamin'
(Let me paint this picture)

[Verse 2: B.A. The Great]
What a [?] roll the dope ball
Red and purple, poe both of 'em
Waking [?] like some [?]
Old school, ridin' over
Dope dealin', that's the motor
Gettin' money, that's the motive
What's your purpose, what's your motor
Million dollar, that's the quota
New whip with the chauffeur
I never drive when I'm posted
We just [?] glow up
My gun never in the holster
How the hate make us buy a car as fast
We just super tied to motive
Stick to the code, lesson [?] true
You won't serve, if I don't know ya

[2x Chorus: B.A. The Great]
I'm just seeing niggas talking (mhmm)
Loose lippin', (mhmm)
Double cuppin' (mhmm)
Mud sippin' (mhmm)
My niggas stomach growl, (mhmm)
Like they ain't had dinner (mhmm)
Young educated nigga sellin' dope, nigga, ridin' and roamin'
