[Intro]
Ever stare the sun in the eyes?
The future is now
Past is yesterday
Tomorrow isn't promised

[Bridge]
She said she don't need none from nobody
She just on all on my line, won't stop callin
She just wanna whip the Lamborghini, I let her
Ain't no pressure, I just tell 'em

[Hook]
Don't you wanna ride shotgun in the brand new Murcielago
Put your cup down baby, let me know, you're drinkin' out the bottle
Bad bitch, yeah baby, tell me something good, you know you wanna swallow
I'm just tryna split a million dollars with all of my partnas

[Verse 1]
Look too good, girl you gotta be a centerfold
Stack of Ben Franks do not fold
Can't recall the last time I had a bill fold
The way we live we gon' need damage control
Punch the pedal, go as fast you can go
She ride it like she got a special license
The way she grip the wood is mesmerizing

Street's what she prefers, livin' like a blur
Daddy was a thug, so she smoke gas
She don't want a thing but some good dick, Dolce purse, Montclair furs
She bad and she know the deal
And she do it just for the thrill
And she got no fucks to give

[Bridge]
She said she don't need none from nobody
She just on all on my line, won't stop callin
She just wanna whip the Lamborghini, I let her
Ain't no pressure, I just tell 'em

[Hook]
Don't you wanna ride shotgun in the brand new Murcielago
Put your cup down baby, let me know, you're drinkin' out the bottle
Bad bitch, yeah baby, tell me something good, you know you wanna swallow
I'm just tryna split a million dollars with all of my partnas

[Verse 2]
Champagne bottles, spray it on the bitches, I don't give a fuck
She got her own cashflow and she throwin' up the bucks
Kicked out the 'W', make too much noise when we fuck
You only got one life young nigga, better live it up
Smoke a whole pound, oh my, she on cloud 9
High sex the best, good neck, she suck the life out me
She bad and she know the deal
And she do it just for the thrill
And she got no fucks to give

Independent, she don't need for nothing
Kicked up with the bosses off the top
Bonnie and Clyde, mu'fuck the cops
We ballin' hard and that's non-stop
Match made in heaven don't care, we don't care
Together we stack paper to the air, the air

[Bridge]
She said she don't need none from nobody
She just on all on my line, won't stop callin
She just wanna whip the Lamborghini, I let her
Ain't no pressure, I just tell 'em

[Hook]
