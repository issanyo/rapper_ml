[Intro:]

AHH!!

(yeah, yeah, yeah, ahh) x4

[Verse:]

Forbidden knowledge you can't learn in college in my Merkaba
Feels like the Universe has unified to come and murder Buck
But we immortal, hopping out of portals; Damn we turning up
May the fire that my soul acquired make the furnace bust
Under Bodhi tree, its only me and all these inner demons
OMG, I'm rolling tree cause the Galactic Center breathing
I don't perpatrate, I meditate to elevate the dead
Magic with they 'K' instead; Outer space where I was bred
Alienated; My nigga they hating but I'ma keep it all love on the real
Adding Angel Numbers like they ain't among us til its looking like a couple of mill
Feeling like my only function to chill
Sitting down like a stump on a hill
I remember when I wanted a deal, now I'm paying homage like its a bill
(Holy, Holy)
Holy water in my Holy Grail
Show me brail instead of acting like you know me well
The system's set up and it's promised that my homies fail;
So I'ma show my fucking ass until I go to --
11:11, a rebel in Heaven
I got the vision and a little direction
My vertabrae got my body flexing but the weight of the world got my shoulders stressing;
So I hold it down when I be lifting up
Drunk monk so my liver stuck
Slowing down from living in a rush
Spitting sixteens like the celings, bruh
