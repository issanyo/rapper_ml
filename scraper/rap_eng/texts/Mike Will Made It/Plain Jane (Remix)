[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
I know my body took a lot of ink
Know I smoke a lot of stink
Bladder piss a lot of pink
Because that lean I like to drink
My face got a lot of tats
My grill got a lot of gold
My mouth talk a lot of shit
My dick fuck a lot of hoes
My stomach be filled with shrimp, Legs limping like a pimp
Gazelles on my fucking frame, waves all in my temp
My mind it be on the prize, hands on with the nine
My traphouse it keep a line, because I'm selling Duncan Hines
Gucci Mane a millionaire, my house I be seldom there
I always be on the road, bank account got several 0's
My britches be True Religion, in the kitchen cooking chickens
Smoking Swishers, busting Phillies, bought two raris, spent a million

[Hook]
This watch right here cost ninety thousand plain jane
But I'mma put some rocks off in it anyway
These haters they gon' hate on you like anyway (anyway)
So I'm gon' put some rims on my shit anyway
Anyway (anyway) Anyway (anyway)
I dumped her, I can find another any day (any day)
Anyway (anyway) Anyway (anyway)
It's not that hot outside but I'mma drop it anyway

[Verse 2: Rocko]
Maybach sitting way back
Said Maybach? Yeah it's out back

She got a fat ass and some big tits
I fuck with her cause her accent
Where the Hublot? Cause it accent

Plus it match the Ace of Spades
On to new ones talkin Audemars got two of 'em
One plain jane, one iced-out
Nigga tried me, knocked his lights out
Got goonies but I'm hands-on
Run the check up for my man's 'nem
That's A-1 FBG
Free Boosie, Free B.G. (You know that's anyway)
I'm a Don ho; your house the size of my Condo

Last of a dying breed

Old school, still wear Tree Timbs
Where that money at? I want me some
With your main bitch and your little sis
Know what time it is nigga, threesome

[Hook]
This watch right here cost ninety thousand plain jane

[Verse: T.I.]
Yeah homes I'm still on

Them big boats I chill on
A nigga talk that shit, but I'll kill homes(BOW!)
My paper-trail stretch real long
They career dead its stillborn

I'm still going in clubs throwing dough until dawn
Popping pills on Sunset
In a aqua Bentley and a plum Vette
I'm all that ho
Call that ho and tell the King say "run that"
Hustle Gang is my entourage
I Striver's Row my camouflage
I got Louis on them new LeBron's

Like my dro, I'm too strong
In the A-town I can't do wrong
Them pussy niggas wanna diss me it take at least two of em' on two songs

We'll never be in the same lane
What you paid for that with them cloudy diamonds, my shit was triple that plain jane
