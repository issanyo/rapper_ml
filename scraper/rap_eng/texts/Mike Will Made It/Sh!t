Aye
Lawd, aye
Knowledge, nigga

Spending money on these hoes
Nigga you ain't fucking shit
Spending money on these hoes
Lawd

[Verse 1]
I
Know my position
I'm poised to point out I'm past important
I'm pretty sure my intentions pure as a priest and pastor
Egregious bastard that's never seen, but I seem to capture
Sleeping slumber something cumbersome, I come and slaughter them
Saw the mountain top I reach the peak, and still I plead the fifth
Pleased to meet myself, it's nice to make my own acquaintance nigga
Came out, saw and conquered
Confidence is through the fucking roof
A lucid dream I like to live, I base it off the honest truth
Bitch I be taking you way back
Giving you literal pay back
Like take that with a new flow
For the few dope
In a four door
What they don't know
Is I goes in
But it will show
And they all froze
And the four all
With a good plan
But a new time
And I need space
I alleviate for this leniency
My levels are up where they need to be
And I only focus on progress
With no pretense
And I can't judge
I won't give up
Push past pain, I'm in the fast lane
I can't stop, nor [?]
But these rappers' slides are ridiculous and derivative
This regurgitation is quite amazing
You ain't the same to enjoy the same
That Monday monotonous
With no common sense, but these compliments
That poor cadence, won't you change it
Been too brainless, that's my opinion
This pen and document anything that I ever think and that's detrimental
Sinning away, you in love with the pace
And the pain is the most, for the sake of the track
With the vibe that I bring, and I swear to protect
I punch your lungs with punctuation, pronunciate and I paraphrase paragraphs
But my language aristocratic
Combative, I'm at this shit like an addict
With extra additives added
Inside my daily routine
I'm serene, seen with a sedative
[?]
Perhaps I'll snap and attack the psychiatrist trying to conversate, talking about my past
"What do you think that you lost and recall the emotions that you have repressed"
Tell me all your sins, I want to hear them
I'm just trying to help
You gotta open up, can't be selfish so please explain yourself
I'm, a young sociopathic sin serenader
Sedated, save with this lyrical love of label
But later I learn intellectual lessons
The dissertation for sure, kinda sore
With the extra essence I effortlessly enunciate
Mentally I'm unstable, emotionally I fluctuate
Force the flows to facilitate
Censorship not incorporated
You reap what you sow, so in other words that's reciprocation
Feeling I supply sophisticated, call it fisticuffs
Physical altercation, I suffocate with my energy
I've attracted the elegance necessary to supersede
I can't succeed by seeking the deeper meanings of life
I live a meager one, personally the way I prefer
Mercilessly murder and mutilate
I melodically communicate, the coup d'Ã©tat
My cross to bear's a lower self esteem
Assume positions to submit and quit
[?] praises to the king, I'm cleaning house
I'm numb, as cold as they come
Accustomed to destitution
Broke the mould while most of these motormouths were conceived
[?] of my keen ability to adjust
It's uppercuts for [?]
I function barely fair enough
My fear is falling if I attain what I work to receive
Then I recede, the [?] regresses if I haven't progressed
I'm just a shell of myself
A deficiency of determination
Mostly motivated by major mistakes that I have made
Was drastically affected by separating myself
See I choose to do this alone
I refuse to accept [?]
You think material wealth and I pray for my mental health
I had hopes that Jehovah could hear me
I fail my test and assignment
He's given me many talents for that I should be appreciative
Instead I ignore it and only focus on the negative responses and the comments
Fuck that I'm givin' a masterpiece
Make a [?] and they mad at me
Said I'm one of the realest to do it
I mean it my nigga well actually
No faculty distracting me, lawd

[Verse 3]
All these, niggas, rap a, 'bout a, life they, know they, never, lived
I don't, give a, fuck I, never, have and, swear I, never, will
Tell 'em I'm the sickest
I sit in sin and repent
I'm the illest of villains [?]
Originator of deprecation is the foundation
Face the facts, I fast for the hell of it
Help the hold on reality
Realistically rationin'
Rappin' circles around 'em
Content with killin' contemporaries
Necessary verbal assault
And they so illiterate
I'm literally livid they livin' minus literacy
But I'm mindin' my bidness
So motherfuck 'em, I'm adios
I don't know about monetization or making money off this
I author the truth and I work so the rest'll fall in place
Said that I'm bringing the real in
We do not care about feelings
I [?] you killing
You people have got to be kidding
The way that I do it is different
Me and my niggas not givin' in
Positionin' myself to be one of the greatest of all time
And the rhyme is like an idea
Nigga, I fear no man breathin'
I stay breachin' these limitations
I won't stop, still going crazy
Can't be touched, just realize that it's not surprisin' I'm this good
[?] Cobain my inspiration
Played "Nevermind" in my infancy like damn
