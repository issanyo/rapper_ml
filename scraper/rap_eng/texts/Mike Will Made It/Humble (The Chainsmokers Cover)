[Verse 1: Andrew Taggart]
I remember making bedroom hits, and now we're counting this
Then I took the "Selfie," this ain't healthy, kids ain't down with this
Wanna meet the plan I took for granted 'til the xanax hits
I can't even read it, 'cause I'm the one to kill the analysts
A.M. to the P.M., P.M. to the A.M., funk
Don't let me down, we're back in town for the greatest, funk
We're just playing around and I still miss my momma, funk
Chris Martin in my apartment, how the fuck we do this, funk
The "Sick Boy" just went viral
Platinum going on the top, [?]
Alex P on TMZ, hello like [?]
There's levels to it, you and I know

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
Bitch, be humble
(Bitch, hol' up, bitch)
(Bitch, hol' up, bitch)
(Bitch, hol' up, bitch)
(Hol' up, hol' up, hol' up)
(Bitch), sit down, be humble (hol' up, bitch)
Sit down, be humble, bitch, sit down

[Bridge: Andrew Taggart]
These songs aren't for the critics, they're for every kid at home
That wants to push the limits and
These songs are not for the critics, they're for every kid at home
That wants to push the limits and
These songs are not for the critics, they're for every kid at home
That wants to push the limits and not...
These songs are not for the critics, they're for every kid at home
That wants to push the limits, sit down

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
(Bitch, hol' up, bitch)
(Bitch, hol' up, bitch)
(Hol' up, hol' up, hol' up)
(Hol' up, hol' up, hol' up)
Bitch, sit down
(Hol' up, hol' up, bitch)
Sit down
(Hol' up, hol' up, bitch)
Sit down
(Hol' up, hol' up, bitch)
Bitch, sit down
