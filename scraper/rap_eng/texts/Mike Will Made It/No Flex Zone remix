[Verse 1:Jordeezy]
Y'all boy jordeezy is back on the spot
Y'all forgot that I got
The talent it's no flex zone for y'all bitches your girl love my kisses
I'm straight vicious you don't got the business
To flex boy I'll straight destroy your crew your screwed now nigga
I launch that trigger
Like I been flexing I been on my blessings
Homie you been stressing
Cause I been giving you that X-ray scan
Homeboy it just began I got plans
For you bitch boy no flex zone
I be sending my drone
Like its World War 3 on this big motherfucker
Your girls is a sucka for real nigga that straight flexing
It's getting hot in here cause girls be crazy in love with my dick I'm so sick like I'm a topic
That y'all can't forget lord give me a sign that I might be overcome on certain shit
I'm hella legit
This shit getting so reckless
I been making your girl breathless
I could see you getting jealous
Cause I'm still shining I know y'all like my rhyming scheme
I'm taking this shit to extreme
No flex zone y'all no better that I be the best
Y'all don't wanna test
Me cause I'll make your day end I can't stop my shining cause my flow still growing
I be rolling
In the deep
I got the best heat
On my shit uh boyz in the hood yeah that's right homie I straight flexing with my homies
"Slay rage" "King dubble" "brain busta" ink cause y'all can't flex in our zone you a straight phony

You better sleep in the nest
Y'all get arrested y'all better quit cause I'll keep going hard until I reached my legacy
I already reached my destiny

[Bridge]
I guaranteed Ima keep outshine y'all
Peace out ooh they didn't want me to have another anthem so I made sure I got another anthem

[Verse 2:Brain Busta]
Busta's so good y'all can't flex in my zone
Y'all ain't taking no rap skills home
Cause you ain't got none and when it comes to brains you ain't got one
Let's say rap skills are fish you ain't caught none
Get outta my grill cause I'm too dope for you
Ain't opening my bottle of talent you ain't got a corkscrew
These are some awesome skills you ain't gonna own
Cause you've only got shit skills in your bones
Y'all can't reach the level of me and Jordeezy
Destroying you would be so damn easy
I know that my lyrics can be cheesy
You want to destroy me but just give up and we'll sign a peace treaty
I know I'm cheesier than nachos and a slice of pizza
But if you've ever beat me in a battle then you're a cheater
Way beyond the level of all you haters
With rhymes more powerful than even Darth Vader
This ain't no game unless you play by my rules
Cause you're just some wannabe and I'm so damn cool
I ain't no fool even though I'm only in middle school
I'm known as the king of rap while you're the king of ridicule
So don't fuck with me unless you wanna get destroyed
Don't underestimate me just cause I'm a little boy
You ain't gonna beat me and make it to the next zone
You ain't good at all you ain't in my flex zone

[Verse 3:Infamous]
Call it flex zone
I'm in the next zone
Ahead of rappers
That be crappers
Got my flex on
This type of rapping leave you asking where's the next song
I got them clapping
Tryna rap I got a vest on you'll see me strapping what ya lacking
When I injure the beat
These little rappers get to acting adding cringe I repeat
You'll see me laughing at your battles I'm a freak on the streets
You'll see me packing in the shackles I ain't needin' my heat
Bang I get to busting when I'm creeping on crime
Hang I get you coming when i'm speaking of time
Gangs ain't something people need to speak of or try
Hand got the trigger ima need it to fly
Calling 911 an emergency fleet
Dialing mine run on I'm eternally free
I'm finding tryin' real hard my eternity bleeding
Got them crying real barred I'm concerned when I'm peeping

[Verse 4:Mental Breakdown]
These anesthetic so pathetic
It makes me want to put you to sleep get it
The vet imbedded
A pen in my head now I need to be beheaded
In order to stop rhyming I cause a hot climate to a lieutenant Ain't a snake without the venom skin shedded your spit synthetic
The skin shredder holding Berettas like they were never invented
A veteran with the veterans venting with inventions
In Venezuela and Venice
Have you bleeding blood from your sweat & tears I'm Dennis the menace
A savage with a tennis racket I'll bend ya backwards
I became a reckless biohazard a genesis bastard
And if I take a punch I'm swinging swords
And if you faggots bring your crew I'm bringing war
Yeah you got a thing for money but me...I got a thing for gore
I think of more important ways to kill you all you demons put on your thinking horns
You living a lie and I'm a living legend all my weapons got double edges
I sever your life sentence in seconds
Dead bodies I be bench pressing you mutha fuckas been testing the testament
But instead I'm demented
Sleep on me and you're resting
On a rusty nail bed and I'm reading
You when flexing I ascended from darkness and all my family descended from heaven
I'll be two stepping with guns pressing
Against your chest ask for a blessing
