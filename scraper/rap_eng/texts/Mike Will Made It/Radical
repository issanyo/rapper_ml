[Intro]
Radical, Radical, Radical, Radical, Radical

[Hook: Gucci]
Radical, Radical, Radical, Radical, Radical
I hit the club I’m strapped up like a Radical, Radical
Drop the top to make this shit Dramatica-matica
White girls and them black girls say I’m Radical, Radical, Radical Radical, Radical
Hit the club I’m strapped up like a Radical, Radical
Drop the top to make this shit Dramatica-matica
Radical, Radical, Radical, Radical, Radical

[Verse 1: Gucci]
Riding with this money but I’m riding like I’m pissed off
Too young to be her daddy but still Gucci Mane the bitch boss
No luggage on the jet but it got a lotta bags doe
And when they unload the jet I make a lotta cash flow
Gucci Mane’s an asshole, boogers on my bank roll
Blow my nose with money bitch gotta lotta pay roll
All I do is hustle baby all I do is win
Sent her to the voicemail she callin' back again
She keep asking me she harassing me
Two butt naked hoes they harassing me
Never let a bad bitch passin’ me, Got stamina no outlasting me
I flowed in without gravity, bitches call me your majesty
Worth some millions not actually, firearms in my faculty

[Hook: Gucci]
Radical, Radical, Radical, Radical, Radical
I hit the club I’m strapped up like a Radical, Radical
Drop the top to make this shit Dramatica-matica
White girls and them black girls say I’m Radical, Radical, Radical Radical, Radical
Hit the club I’m strapped up like a Radical, Radical
Drop the top to make this shit Dramatica-matica
Radical, Radical, Radical, Radical, Radical

[Verse 2: Gucci]
I’m radical, radical, I’m super cool
I shave it off the top just like a barber do
My engine sound louder than what a Harley do
The way I’m switching gears thought I went to ‘Rari school
Radical, dramatical
I slow my words I’m not very grammatical,-matical
They let me up they locked me up in Attica
But Diamonds on my chest they from Africa, Radical
Old national, a bachelor with two hoes in my grand national
Seen another walk now lets be rational
Swerved and picked her up now its four passengers

[Hook: Gucci]

White girls and them black girls say I’m Radical, Radical, Radical Radical, Radical
Hit the club I’m strapped up like a Radical, Radical
