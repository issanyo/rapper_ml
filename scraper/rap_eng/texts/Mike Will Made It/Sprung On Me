(Synthesized voice intro)
Go Charlie
Get funky

(Chorus)
Sprung on me baby
Sprung on me baby
You must be crazy
Sprung on me baby

(Verse 1)
As I can plainly see
You're really into me
I got you sprung on me
Just a wannabe

I am reality
You're just a fantasy
As I can plainly see
Just a wannabe

(Chorus)
Sprung on me baby (you're just a fantasy)
Sprung on me baby (as I can plainly see)
You must be crazy (I got you sprung on me)
Sprung on me baby

(Verse 2)
You think your style's unique
It's fixed on G.A.P
There's no apology
From the wannabe

(Bridge)
Sorry, Uncle Charlie
Because I was standing first in line
Tell me no way, are you ok
You must have been out of your mind

(Chorus)
Sprung on me baby (whoa)
Sprung on me baby (oooh)
You must be crazy (uhh)
Sprung on me baby

(Rap verse)
Most pretend but really have no way
Copy cats turn the situation from thick to thin
Reaching the tic-toc But never but give props
And even the hip-hop they gettin' a thrown like Flip Flops
So give up just do it, don't try to bust through
You know who you are so tell me why must you
Continue to imitate, sound like an emulate
Try to be Charlie, of course it's going to sound great
Charlie's back though, I'm letting you all know
He's blasting off so you better just get low
Just a word to the wise and small fries
We're cutting off all ties and Giants are Four Guys
So Beware For A Beats Worst Nightmares
Some don't dare, and others just don't compare
I said, "Charlie why is everybody riding your beats?"
He said, "It's simple G, they sprung on me"

(Bridge)
Sorry, Uncle Charlie
Because I was standing first in line
Tell me no way, are you ok
You must have been out of your mind (oh oh)
Sorry, Uncle Charlie
You must have been out of your mind
Tell me no way, are you ok
You must have been out of your mind (miiiind)

(Chorus)
Sprung on me baby
Sprung on me baby
You must be crazy
Sprung on me baby (I gotta sprung on me)

Sprung on me baby
Sprung on me baby (I gotta sprung on me)
You must be crazy (ooh-wee)
Sprung on me baby
Sprung on me baby
Sprung on me baby
