[Hook]
Sean Spicer is a goddamn liar
Shit is lit, p-p-pants on fire
First day on the job you whylin'
Said the crowd was big, I heard it was dumb quiet

Both sides of the aisle, they geekin'
You lie for whatever reason
Think that we won't care
Stay sleep, bitch

Next time wear a suit that fits (ay)

[Verse]
What in the world was you thinkin'?
Everybody knows that you were reachin'
Said the spot was litter than Obama's
That's like me sayin' I hit Ivanka

I'm a fuckin' black Tweeter
Amazon Prime keeper
I don't lie 'cause I don't need to
Won't say hello if you evil
Took a pic, at the march
But not really 'cause my knee hurt
Kellyanne, on the TV, I don't really wanna see her

SHE GOES OFF!

Man she goes off
Said the media hatin' - "YOU NIGGAS WRONG"
But bitch we saw them pics what is you talm'bout?
Just stick to pollin', you must be trollin'

[Hook]
Sean Spicer is a goddamn liar
Shit is lit, p-p-pants on fire
Day one, niggas just started whylin'
"IT'S ALTERNATIVE", alternative to what's right (yuh)

You lied all goddamn weekend
You lie for whatever reason (TELL D TRUTH)
Think that we won't care
Stay sleep, bitch

Next time wear a suit that fits (Tampagne!)
