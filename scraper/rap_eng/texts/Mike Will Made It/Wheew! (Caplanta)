[Hook: Lil Capp]
Big stacks (wheew!)
Kush packs (wheew!)
Big gats (wheew!)
This track (wheew!)
I'm in the zone (wheew!)
My money long (wheew!)
If you ain't busting your chrome, then you gone (wheew!)
Big stacks (wheew!)
Kush packs (wheew!)
Big gats (wheew!)
This track (wheew!)
I'm in the zone (wheew!)
My money long (wheew!)
If you ain't busting your chrome, then you gone (wheew!)

[Verse 1: Lil Capp]
I pop my collar, I'm throwing dollars
Them hoes follow, they wanna swallow
Damn, I'm the truth, swag through the roof
And Lil Capp the President, who the fuck are you?
I'm getting cash, I'm popping tags
You looking mad, so kiss my ass
Higher than E.T., I'm 'bout to phone home
Patr√≥n, it got me gone, goddamn, I'm in the zone

[Verse 2: Slim Dunkin]
Slim rolling like I popped a bean and chop them, make you jump and scream
Bitches shots drop the team and gangstas turn from [?]
Never been a sucker, lollipop, I don't need that
Don't talk to me, let you [?] where the weed at?
Them bands, I be popping them
Her pants, I be dropping them
She choosing (why?)
'Cause she saw me with Capp and Flock and them (with who?)
B. Ceezy touched down and the crowd like, "Whoa!"
When Chaz get home, we gon' win the Super Bowl

[Hook: Lil Capp]
Big stacks (wheew!)
Kush packs (wheew!)
Big gats (wheew!)
This track (wheew!)
I'm in the zone (wheew!)
My money long (wheew!)
If you ain't busting your chrome, then you gone (wheew!)
Big stacks (wheew!)
Kush packs (wheew!)
Big gats (wheew!)
This track (wheew!)
I'm in the zone (wheew!)
My money long (wheew!)
If you ain't busting your chrome, then you gone (wheew!)

[Verse 3: Waka Flocka Flame]
Sidekick, sidekick, man, I love my side bitch
Late night, late night, you can get beat right
Kush blunt, doubleshot, that'll keep my dick hard
Hit Squad, Brick Squad, we go so hard
Pass me the O.J. 'cause I'm fucking rolling, man
I'm getting money, diamonds like a soda can
Cooler than a fucking fan, higher than the ceiling, man
Waka Flocka Flame and I'm 'bout to get a million, man
