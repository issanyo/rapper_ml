[Hook: Future]
I come looking for you with Haitians
I stay smoking on good Jamaican
I fuck bitches from different races
You get money they started hating (turn up!)
I woke up in a new Bugatti (Remix!)
I woke up in a new Bugatti (Remix!)
I woke up in a new Bugatti (Remix!)
I woke up in a new Bugatti (Remix!)
I woke up in a new Bugatti (Remix!)

[Verse 1: T.I.]
And it's paid for nigga
Got racks, stack 'em up like Lego nigga
I'm a motherfuckin' G, I don't play with no nigga
Multi-millionaire self-made ho nigga
H-U-S-T-L-E gang
For that, in God we trust, we bang
I'm the new John Gotti in a new Bugatti
I got a few young hotties wanna get shit poppin'
Right, put it in the light
Nigga got ice but it don't look right
If a nigga buy a brick and it don't cook right
I'll whip that shit for a rack, sit tight
I got a bag full of tools and some yay to move
And all I want is money, leave the fame to you
I graduated out of gladiator school
So all I know is GO like I’m trained to do
Right now took my Masi
Pedal to the metal I’m ashin' out
I let the top down in my Phantom drop
Blowin', I'm high as an astronaut
When you see me, I'm cashin' out
Walked into Mercedes bought half the lot
You keep carrying on, you getting carried out
Cause I don’t take ass whoopins, just pass ‘em out
Is this worth getting blasted about?
No forreal, is it worth getting blasted about?

[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]
Money conversation
Get so high, I be scrapin'
Got my eyes like a Asian
In my ride, like I'm racin'
In the sky, like a plane
It's Gang or die
Ain't no lames up in my circle
Ain't no ho shit in my eyes
Throwin' money in the air
Poppin' bands and let it fly
Where I'm from, you come up short
Pull that thing and let it fly
You know me, blow so much dank, think I'm Marley
Got so much ink on my body
Brought so much drink to the party
I fell asleep and woke up in a new Bugatti

[Bridge: Future]
I woke up in a new Bugatti...

[Verse 3: RiFF RAFF]
Yeuh, aqua jewels - white Sprite
I just won 100K at the Mayweather fight
Finna take life - I live like nine lives
Cookin' crab legs at Drake's house the next night
Ballin' hard, but I don't play sports
Drank a whole bottle of Henny
Damn near crash the Porsche
I hit the full court riding on the white horse
Unzip the windbreaker pants into Versace shorts
My shows are sold out from everywhere to February
Ah shit, look who it is, the white Tyler Perry
Ridge Berry, straight pints for the eye gems
They figured I was kin to a dentist the way I floss a Benz

[Hook: Future]

[Verse 4: 2 Chainz]
Flow hot as the Mojave
Gimme that sloppy shit
On my Tyras did
Give her some money, she did
Like this, I'mma say this
Fuck it, I'll say it
If you got good pussy
You should always have your rent paid
Stroking some bands... if I'm not mistaken
Add up my outfit - fashion statement
This the school of hard knocks, graduation

(I woke up in a new Bugatti!)

[Verse 5: Ace Hood]
I'm sick of y'all niggas all talkin' crazy
Hottest nigga spittin' and they can't debate it
I didn't really know 2Pac or Big
But know the beast within'll reincarnate 'em
Fuck underrated, I'm constipated
I'm shittin' on 'em, fuck toilet paper
You're now tuned into the fuckin' greatest
Ace Hood, congratulations
Say name one nigga that's rockin' with him
Flow like a hundred round choppa nigga
Made a way out of the jungle
And now they in trouble, I used to be humble as shit
Recently flooded my neck and my wrist
Tell all them critics to suck on the dick
Nigga...

(I woke up in a new Bugatti!)
