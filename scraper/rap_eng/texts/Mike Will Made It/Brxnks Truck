[Intro]
Ear Drummers
Jxm

[Chorus]
Bring out the Brink's truck, I'm young, fly and iced up (icy)
100 yard dash, bitch, I had to run my price up
Nigga, boss your life up, I had to boss mine up (ayy)
10,000 dollar outfit, hundred dollar lineup (ayy)

[Verse 1]
You know these bitches checkin' for me
In the DMs gettin' naked for me (ayy)
I ain't even took a dollar out my pocket
And the girls still shakin' for me (shake, shake)
And I'm frosty like Tony (ayy)
In the club smokin' weed with the owner (woah)
I can walk on water
Poppin' Ace of Spades like Corona (ayy)

[Refrain]
When you on top, niggas gon' hate on you
That's what they're s'posed to do, I don't know how to lose (yeah)
I think the 'Rari go faster without the roof (skrrt, ayy)
When you on top, niggas gon' hate on you
That's what they're s'posed to do, I don't know how to lose (yeah)
I think the 'Rari go faster without the roof (Jxm)

[Verse 2]
Fuckin' on shawty, I might go a round or two
Stackin' up, I love how my money counter move (I love it)
N.W.A., nigga with attitude, I got a bag or two
And I dropped out of school (dropout)
I'm goin' up, check my vertical (check it)
Fuck it, mane, I'm breakin' every rule (every rule)
TMZ harassin' me, I got a camera crew (woah)
I'm addicted to shoppin', so everything brand new (everything brand new, yeah)
I'm friends with the jeweler, my diamonds like Shamu (my diamonds like Shamu, ayy, ooh)
She rubbin' the head like she applyin' shampoo (she rubbin' the head, yeah)
Pretty face, she got a lil' ass, too (she got a lil' ass, yeah)
Keep a few racks on me, I used to work in the factory
Niggas been hatin', that shit never bothered me
I make they bitch come and swallow me
Nut on her back, then I tell her to follow me (woo)
Teacher said that I'm a mothafuckin' prodigy (Jxm)
When I'm shoppin', I don't care what it's costin' me
Ten bands, really, that ain't a lot to me (woo)
Turn up my swag to infinity (Jxm)
I leveled up on these niggas (leveled up)
Yeah, I leveled up (woo, woo)
I bezeled up on these niggas (bezeled up)
Yeah, I bezeled up (woo, woo)
I ain't got time for no negative energy (no)
I'm on a winnin' streak, I'm on a killin' spree (we winnin', my nigga)
The devil be doin' the most, but he don't ever get to me

[Chorus]
Bring out the Brink's truck, I'm young, fly and iced up (icy)
100 yard dash, bitch, I had to run my price up
Nigga, boss your life up, I had to boss mine up (ayy)
10,000 dollar outfit, hundred dollar lineup (ayy)

[Refrain]
When you on top, niggas gon' hate on you
That's what they're s'posed to do, I don't know how to lose (yeah)
I think the 'Rari go faster without the roof (skrrt, ayy)
When you on top, niggas gon' hate on you
That's what they're s'posed to do, I don't know how to lose (yeah)
I think the 'Rari go faster without the roof (Jxm)
