[Intro]
Black Bottoms in ya city
She acting so sadity
Yet her nigga be with me

Don't you know, he don't want you girl
You steady subtweeting, acting so delusional
Meanwhile ya nigga throwin it back on the low

[Chorus]
That man is a real dick eater. (He dick eat)
Waterfalls when he sucking on me, yah. (Suck on me)
Throw it back, three strikes on me, yah
Make it bounce like a trampoline, yah

When he with you, he be thinkin' 'bout eatin' this. (He thinking)
Come home, breath smellin' like penis. (Smell like peen)
But, you're so oblivious to the scene, yah
You with a DL gay, poor thing, yah

[Verse]
You really out here looking like Boo-Boo. (The fool)
You need to pay attention to what dude do
See, I ain't one to be exposing people
But, it's so see-thru, no peephole

He's a fuckin' Black Bottom
Fell in love with the sodom
Hillary prolly taught 'em
You can tell how he ride 'em (Rodham)

I'm a fuckin' Black Tiger
Big Daddy be the title
On my line, never idle
He get louder than recitals

And Polly Pocket ya pants
Then spendin all of the bands
On Avereaux. That's ya mans
But this dick keep 'em entranced

Make 'em ride for me
Shawty, are you sure you wanna rival me?Understand, I'm the man
Stupid lil' ho, you a fan of a fan
When I began, that's the end

And that's bible, bitch
Diggin' in him like a ditch
He be catching when that white get pitched

Yeah, you might get ditched
Baby girl, this dick is rich
And I heard that you got that fish
Ahhhhhh

You childish, stay in a kids place
And when you kiss 'em
Come & tell me how my kids taste

[Chorus]
That man is a real dick eater. (He dick eat)
Waterfalls when he sucking on me, yah. (Suck on me)
Throw it back, three strikes on me, yah
Make it bounce like a trampoline, yah

When he with you, he be thinkin' 'bout eatin' this. (He thinking)
Come home, breath smellin' like penis. (Smell like peen)
But, you're so oblivious to the scene, yah
You with a DL gay, poor thing, yah
