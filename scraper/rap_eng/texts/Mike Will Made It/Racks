[Intro]
It's Dolph, uh huh
Yeah, hey

[Verse 1:]
Shining harder than Times Square
You can see the ice from a mile away
Little nigga with a big bank
Big pistol and a two toned Wraith
Momma told me
Don't fuck with these booster ass niggas cause they too faced
Just spent me another 60k on me another big face
You out here chasin' these nothin' bitches
I just met me a bad bitch at the bank
I don't kick it with fuck niggas or fake niggas cause I can't relate
Tried to leave the streets but can't escape
Takin' over shit, fuck being patient
I told lil momma that ass so fat that she deserve a motherfuckin' trophy
Lil nigga playin' with all the paper still gettin' geeked like I'm smokin'
I'm already high as hell but the weed so good I keep rollin'
Got a driveway full of foreign shit
Everybody know I love a juicy bitch
I smash her good then I lose the bitch
I lose the bitch yeah I'm through with it
Yeah I got to get back to that paper
No I ain't got no time for relations
I'd rather go weigh some paper before my time get wasted

[Hook]
I got racks on me, I got stacks on me
I got racks on me, I got stacks on me
I spend it and go get some more
I spend it and go get some more
I need it to get in this dope
I spend it and go get some more
I got racks on me, I got stacks on me
I got racks on me, I got stacks on me

[Verse 2]
I spend it and go get some more
I jump in that Porsche and pull up on your ho
I got bread on me
Hey call me back bout 30 minutes, I'm gettin' some head homie
I put 'er to sleep wit' my dick
Roll up a blunt while I'm drivin', I got racks on me
I got stacks on me, I ain't stoppin' homie
Nigga I got paper to get
Your diamonds ain't hittin' like this
Your bitch don't look like shit
Nah I don't see these little niggas
Nah I don't see these little niggas
Better go get you some skrilla
Sippin' on syrup, tippin' strippers
Smokin' weed, takin' pictures
The bad bitches love a nigga
I'm nothing like the other niggas
Only if you knew what I had to do to get it
All of my niggas they with it
I got rid of all of my bitches
Tryna keep up with me a nigga gonna run theyselves crazy
Tryna keep up with these bitches these niggas gotta be crazy

[Hook]
I got racks on me, I got stacks on me
I got racks on me, I got stacks on me
I spend it and go get some more
I spend it and go get some more
I need it to get in this dope
I spend it and go get some more
I got racks on me, I got stacks on me
I got racks on me, I got stacks on me
