[Pre-Hook: Curtis Williams]
Instead of loading a chopper I'd rather roll me a blunt
But if you looking for problems, my nigga, get what you want
I'm at your house and I'm black, couple nines in the front
A couple nines in the back so nigga, move if you want

[Hook]
Cause we want everything, nigga, everything
Everything, nigga, everything
Everything, nigga, everything
Everything, nigga, everything

[Verse 1: Curtis Williams]
Designer, my clothes and my drugs
I pull up in skinnies at clubs
Your bitch on my dick, she come to the crib
She passed around, no love
My niggas, they skating and dealing
She saying the money appealing
Ain't worry about what a fuck nigga gon say
All the real niggas say they gonna feel it
Said I got crosses all on my denim
Bands stuffed up in them
My bank card and my face card
Hold the same weight I'm chilling
Smoking weed when I'm rolling weed
And I'm drinking, too
Not one gram of my new dutch, ho, I need two
Just a bunch of young niggas getting paid
She gonna smoke but she never get saved
Drop a song but they never get played
Blunt full of kush, my closet got BAPE
Drop a tab and I'm straight
These other niggas too late
Said my niggas got now, this other niggas gotta wait

[Pre-Hook]
Instead of loading a chopper I'd rather roll me a blunt
But if you looking for problems, my nigga, get what you want
I'm at your house and I'm black, couple nines in the front
A couple nines in the back so nigga, move if you want

[Hook]
Cause we want everything, nigga, everything
Everything, nigga, everything
Everything, nigga, everything
Everything, nigga, everything

[Verse 2: Jace]

Run up in the crib like runnin
Give us all the drugs and the money
Give us all the ones and the hundreds
Smile when we done like it's funny
Blacked out nigga, he ain't even see it coming
Caught him in the back, wait, no nigga, no running
From the East Side, my nigga, this nothing
Al Horford, Kyle Korver
Hit him with the Hawk then it's all over
Going through the freezer and I'm runnin through the mattress
Fuck the bullshit, nigga, tell me where you stashing
Last name Bronson, all about action
38 golden, let a nigga flash it
Uncle Sam grams, nigga still taxing
Chopper gon sing like a Braxton
Camera on the set but it's still no acting
Caught up in the money and we still gonna trap it, nigga
Now it's Alexander Wang and your bitch on my wang
I fucked her in the rain, she almost broke my chain
Murakami on the plane, what the fuck you saying?
We don't want a little, we want everything

[Pre-Hook]
Instead of loading a chopper I'd rather roll me a blunt
But if you looking for problems, my nigga, get what you want
I'm at your house and I'm black, couple nines in the front
A couple nines in the back so nigga, move if you want

[Hook]
Cause we want everything, nigga, everything
Everything, nigga, everything
Everything, nigga, everything
Everything, nigga, everything
