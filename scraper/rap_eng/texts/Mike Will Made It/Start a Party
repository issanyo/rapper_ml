[Hook: Slim Jxmmi & (Swae Lee)]
Beaucoup bitches in the lobby
Bust it open like piñata
Beaucoup bottles on the counter
This is how you start a party
(This is how you start a party)
(This is how you start a party)
(Tell a friend to tell somebody)
(We about to start the party)

[Verse 1: Swae Lee]
I told my niggas I'ma pull up to the party
Give me 20 minutes (Im on the way)
Show up in some leather pants
With some bitches you ain't even know existed
Tossed up a lot of mothafuckin' money
She said, "Let me guess, you a drug dealer"
Said, "Nah, I just brought a lot of money
And a whole lot of drugs with me"
You don't smoke loud, be quiet
Shut the fuck up, nigga, be quiet
All hail that nigga Swae Lee
I done told y'all too many times
Five bad bitches sittin' in line
Fuckboys, hatin' on me from the side
Can't see y'all niggas, I'm blind
Y'all niggas ain't Swae like mine
Y'all niggas ain't real, stop lyin'
Them hoes I fuck be dyin'
Them bitches I diss be yours
Everything I touch turns gold
My bankroll just won't fold
Goddamn them hundreds too old
Gettin' money my favorite sport
Carrera my favorite Porsche

[Verse 2: Slim Jxmmi]
Slim Jxmmi, got a whole bunch of hit bitches with me
Got your main girl on a bean and the lean
Shakin' like a walkin' tambourine for the green
I can show you how to start a party
I can show you how to pop a bottle
I can show you how to get retarded
Pop the cork on this Dom Perignon
Pour it all on your body, yeah
I can shoot that K like
Got Chinese women like Shanghai
I got Playboy bunnies on standby
If you can make it clap, put your hands up
Who got the ass I can grab on?
Lemme see you clap for the camera
I can throw a whole lot of cash out
(Whole lot of, whole lot of cash out)
Walked in the party, got the booze, got the booze
Rockstar, so I mixed it with the juice, juice, juice, juice
Bad bitches bustin, come here, let me touch it
The money keep fallin', her ass keep bumpin'
