Work ya muscle
Move that muscle

[Verse 1: Eearz]
Working my wrist, about to break the stovetop
I pull up on my block, they like “Bro what you got?
Crank up the feed then I smoke out the lot
Threw off the roof then we open the spot
Look in your eyes, real nigga you is not
Pour up liquor for my niggas who is not
She took 40 shots, load it like a [?] Glock
Poppin’ her back, lil mama go and work that, work that

[Hook: Eearz]
Work ya muscle
Move that muscle
Throw the money
Made a puddle
Bring that duffel

Move that muscle
Work ya muscle
Move that muscle
Work ya muscle
Move that muscle

Move that muscle
Work ya muscle
Move that muscle

[Verse 2: Eearz]
Let me hear a nigga stacking up residuals
Got line three painted on my [?]
Cause your bitch oversized like kimbo
I’ma ah-ah-ah on his wife [?] phone
Money change in the game [?] in for

THC, young nigga been dope
Still nigga gon’ work that, work that, work that

[Hook: Eearz]
