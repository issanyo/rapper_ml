I don’t got no type
Bad bitches is the only thing that I like
I just hope it's tight
My mama say I’m wavy imma be like this for life

[Verse 1]
I don’t got no type
You don’t got no hype
Put that chick to sleep
Tell that bitch goodnight
Wavy, wavy
Boy thats what I’m livin like
(I mean it)
I don’t splurge a lot
Don’t get curved a lot
Dope to serve a lot
Whips I swerve a lot
Roley oh roley
No tick to turn the clock
(You seen it)
And the Spanish hoes call me Mí-les
I bet the game’ll make that bitch flip
Nintendo DS
Slide out them jeans, that pussy on recess
I talk like I’m livin' I be with the BS
Broke, nope, I’m not with that crowd
My folk, folk blow down piff that loud
She gone get with it drop a band or something
'Cause I don't fuck with no chick that browse
That pussy talking to me
It know my language
And I bet ya booty could clap
Like the 'Nolia can't it

Just like you from the N.O
Ain’t got no nigga, she a widow
She think she just my type
No I did not get the memo

[Hook]


[Verse 2]
Hola hola
Hope the pussy doper
Like a line of coca
Play in it like Ponderosa
'Cause the bitches love me just like they love Sosa
I'm young & wavy plus I'm dreaded up
My nigga plugged me, yeah he set it up
Now I got the juice
Light up a Newport and pour me a duece
I get to leanin' all in that pussy
Might do the Molly to give me a boost
She say she like my tongue
We do the 70 minus one
I tell her don't throw it back too fast
You do too much and I might just cum
She stupid thick
Tatted my name when she Google it
She say my Soundcloud got bookoo hits
Plus her main nigga be all on that fufu shit

But you can't be my main
You might get in the way right now
Plus I ain't lookin for bae right now
