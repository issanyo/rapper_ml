Verse 1:
Devil in my ear saying go back to that trap
My homie hit me up saying pull up with a mask
Real crip nigga got put on just like a hat
Been through that struggle ain't no plans of going back
Nigga cross me cross Em out just like an X
Fuck and leave a hoe then I move onto the next
Niggas really bitches, young thug with that dress
Lights went out so I had to call my connect
All these niggas pussy they're gonna fold up under press
Before I trust a nigga put Em on to the test
Call my Memphis savage and he'll pull up with a tec
And I'm a street nigga ain't got time for the rest
I'm just tryna get that motherfucking cheddar
Lied to the judge said a nigga gonna do better
In and out the rain I ain't ever had a sweater
How is he your homie you ain't even wrote him letters
Haters pillow talking tryna knock me off my game
Bust a nigga head if he reaching for my chain
Whole lot of money heard lil benji is a stain
Fuck a red dot, I ain't gotta do no aim
The system, it got my fingerprint
Dirty money talking it might need a peppermint
