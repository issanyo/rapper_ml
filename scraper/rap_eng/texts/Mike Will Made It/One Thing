[Verse 1]
I stay with some kush, I stay with some bitches
I stay with some money, just counted a ticket
I stopped drinking Lean, went right back to liquor
Pull up on your biotch, she know I'm that nigga
First she gon' get in, roll out with a thug
She wanna have sex, she wanna do drugs
Ty not a pimp, $ign is a player
$ign won't save her, $ign will fuck but won't date her

[Hook]
I'm thinking one thing, I want one thing
I'm thinking one thing, one thing
More money, more money, more money, more money
More money, more money, more money, more
More money, more money, more money, more

[Verse 2]
I'm doing this shit for the dope, doing this shit for my bro
Doing this shit for the love, smoking this weed just because
I'ma fuck and give her back, that bitch ain't shit but a rat
Whoa, I get head from my bitches, then I hit 'em from the back
If a nigga try me, my gun go rat-a-tat-tat
From the west side of LA where the young niggas banging
Homies getting out of jail and meet the new generation
Young nigga nation, fuck being patient
All my bitches bad, all your bitches basic
Dolla $ign a monster, Dolla $ign a problem
Dollar signs and commas, money ain't a problem

[Hook]
Thinking one thing, I want one thing
I'm thinking one thing, one thing
More money, more money, more money, more money
More money, more money, more money, more
More money, more money, more money, more

[Bridge]
The money, the money, the money
All of my bitches tell me they love me
I tell them, "Go get me the money"
Money, the money, the money, the money

[Hook]
Thinking one thing, I want one thing
I'm thinking one thing, one thing
More money, more money, more money, more money
More money, more money, more money, more
More money, more money, more money, more
