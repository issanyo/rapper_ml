[Chorus]
Things we did do, nights we've been thru
I'll still call you, I gave all I had to...

[Verse 1: D. Unis]

How could I forget all the memories that we made
And I was only just a young boy who fell in love with the chase, I can not forget that taste, when I finally won the race
But time is always winding but I knew that time would change
I'm happy that you finally moved down south
I'm happy that you planned it and you got it figured out
I hope you find the perfect family and perfect spouse
I hope that you followed all your dreams
I hope that you'll forever remember me

[Chorus] x2

[Verse 2]

Hate that you think it's best that we probably just stay distant, I'm Trying come and hint to ya but you never do listen
I was gonna take you but The music got too busy
If you just stayed patient you'd be making this news with me, and I know that I told you just hold on
And time is of essence but you didn't wait too long
So I said, things we did do
Nights we've been through
Somehow I knew, I gave all I had to you

[Chorus]
