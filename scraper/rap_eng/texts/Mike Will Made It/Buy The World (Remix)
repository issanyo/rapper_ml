[VERSE 1: Shanaweezy]

Shanaweezy sign these
No bitch I ain't doin' shit for free
I'mma do it for the vine, you gonna do it for the D
If it makes no sense it makes no penny
Not even a sheldon from the big bang theory
All I want is pretty girls no igloo no siri
Only 16 & I got my own business
Headed to the bank and it ain't even Christmas
Shanaweezy worldwide got fans from a distance
Shoutout to Roaa, Layal, Kindah, Foad, Jafar, Noor & islayyou for instance
The air from my concert's gonna cost a fortune
Got the balls to come for me? Testicular Torsion!
Got a sexy butt chin
I just wanna buy the world with no budget
Yooo.. Payday waiting for my check at the door
Someday imma get my boss to open the doors
Mind on my dough
I am your goals
Our time is worth money there's so much you don't know
Jafar & Me... Let's go!
Ain't talking building blocks but Leggo!
I just wanna be next to Biggie & Pac... Impossible? Well nothing's impossible to God
SHANAB!

[VERSE 2: Jafar]

Second time is a charm
Me & Shanaweezy on the beat.. REST IN PEACE
10 years ago I was broke
Now if it ain't about money then me no concern
Reppin for my crew till they put me in a coffin
But right now? there ain't no stopping
All eyez on me, bitch close your book
Y'all can't smell what I'm trying to cook
Haven't started yet and already helping other rappers get views
He had to pick, I didn't refuse
A few more years and I will be on the news
Rap like I'm broke and doing this shit for a living
I got money to the ceiling but I'm tryna show you how I'm feeling
I will keep getting better with time, just watch
This is just the beginning, I'm in the building now
It's just me right here, look out
Bitch I'm the only thing you'll hear about
