[Verse]:
Queen!
I don't fuck with no rip rappin' bitches
These hoes want features
They wanna be friends
Wanna give my pussy some kisses
You just want the pussy
You don't want shit else
You don't want the wealth
You don't want the help
You don't wanna do it for self
You just wanna do it my belt
I know how it feel and I know how it felt
To be all alone be in my zone
Be in my phone leave me alone
Need it alone
Fuck going home
Bitch I'm finna be on
Felt that shit in my bones
Mama was wrong but fuck it, forgive her
If she need it, we gone bitch, stop it failure not an option
I just took a bitch nigga he just took me shoppin'
Next I need an island, take a bitch to Thailand
Pussy so good he moanin', I'm silent
I don't let nobody alter my songs
You could offer yo' dome, offer yo' chrome
They gone offer a clone
Bitch I need me a Rome, bitch I need me a city
Suck my titties fuck it, I'm pretty
Yo' hoe silly
Bitches shitty, cause they ain't fuckin' with me
I do not fuck with no rappers
Rappers are cappers
Cappin' ass rappers
Cappin' ass rappers
Rappers are cappers
These cappers are rappers
I-I-I do not fuck with no rappers

[Outro]:
Rappers are cappers
Cappers are rappers
Bitch tweakin', Ima slap her
Cappers are...
Cappers are...
Cappers are rappers
