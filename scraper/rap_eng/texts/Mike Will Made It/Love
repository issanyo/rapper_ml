[Intro: Swae Lee]
EarDrummers!
Don't be cryin' off lashes (nah)
Sayin' your last goodbyes (last goodbyes, goodbyes)
Who gave you wings for days?
Mike WiLL Made-It
Yeah, I'm on a low, low tide
It's like...
(Fuck Love)

[Chorus: iLoveMakonnen]
Ever since that day
When you went away, hey, hey
Love hasn't been the same
You used to light up my day (hey, hey)
But so much changed
Now all I see is grey
I smoke now, you turned me into a stoner
I'm heartless, and I don't need a donor
This is who I am (hey, hey, hey)
Because of you I am
Fallin' down
I'm smokin' up
Since you ain't around
I got my middle fingers up
Fuck love

[Verse 1: iLoveMakonnen]
I'm the type of guy, kinda used to bad luck
I start to see a little different lookin' back on us
You seem to have a lot of pride as we accept defeat
You said you had another ride from leavin' me
So I don't think about how you're doin'
We know our hearts took a bruisin'
From the last time you were playin' off
'Cause your last game you were playin' us
Yeah, yeah, it sucks
I know, you put so much
On the ground, in the dream
And so now I don't speak your name

[Chorus: iLoveMakonnen]
Ever since that day
When you went away, hey, hey
Love hasn't been the same
You used to light up my day (hey, hey)
But so much changed
Now all I see is grey
I smoke now, you turned me into a stoner
I'm heartless, and I don't need a donor
This is who I am
Because of you I am
Fallin' down

[Verse 2: Swae Lee]
Time out (time out)
We don't wanna play anymore (yeah)
I'm thinkin' why-y not?
Shoot my shot, it's girl's night out next door (it's goin' up)
I'm so caught up with Lindsey (yeah)
Her friend is quote, unquote, "with me" (yeah)
I explained that I could never fall, fall, fall
She said there'll never be another (ooh)
So maybe you should leave your number (ooh)
I'm not sayin' that I'll blow you up (blow you up)
Sometimes I wonder, just who it was for
If it wasn't for us, if it wasn't for us

[Chorus: iLoveMakonnen]
I smoke now, you turned me into a stoner
I'm heartless, and I don't need a donor
This is who I am (hey, hey, hey)
Because of you I am
Fallin' down
I'm smokin' up
Since you ain't around
I got my middle fingers up
Fuck love

[Verse 3: Slim Jxmmi]
When I think about the time we wasted (yeah)
I find a way (uh) to make it make sense (yeah, yeah)
She's a heartbreaker (heartbreaker)
She ain't lookin' for a man to save her (nah)
No she ain't lookin' for a man to save her
I shoulda known (shoulda known)
It wasn't love at first sight, it was lust all along (woo)
Shoulda left that girl alone
Ignored the voice inside my head, I guess I'll never learn

[Chorus: Slim Jxmmi & iLoveMakonnen]
Ever since that day
You went away, life hasn't been the same
You used to light my day
'Til you went away, now all I feel is pain
I smoke now, ooh, I'm such a stoner
I drink now, yeah, I'm such a loner
This is who I am
Because of you, I am
Fallin' down
I'm smokin' up
Since you ain't around
I got my middle fingers up
Fuck love
