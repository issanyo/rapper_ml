Cartel, Cartel Cartel, Cartel, cartel

Brick after brick on table
Nigga when i pull it out
Cocking them hammers
I squeeze it
Nigga you know we can shoot it out
Dance on these niggas at the round table
See the ring nigga who the king
See the plug
Get the drugs
Move the drugs
What the f***
You know that I'm hungry
I'm asking for mouths
Trapping and packing my nigga we holding the fort
We ain't talking on the phone nigga doing landlines
Cell phones they be tracking nigga doing fed time
The plug say he love a nigga
He pass me the work
Im gonna pass it to another nigga
Keep in mind don't play with that
Bag it nigga and bring it back
See me in the kitchen
See me whipping
Now give me that
