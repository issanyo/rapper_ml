[Verse 1:]
I've done it before, I've seen it before
Tears splashin' the floor when I close the door, in her face
Quoth the Raven nevermore, yo got a Poe face
She got a million dollar body and a welfare face, yo poor face
Rae Sremmurd said it best, yo face look like Donald Trump
Lie to me, act like I'll believe anything, I don't believe yo face
I drew a picture of me with Beyonce
This could be us, but yo face is ugly, hoe

[Hook:]
So back to what I was saying (money make the world go 'round)
This could be us but you're playing (money make the girl go down)
This could be us but you're playing (money make the world go 'round)
I'm high, I hope I don't sound crazy (money make the girl go down)
Fuck what them bitches was saying (money make yo Mom go down)
This could be us but you're playing (moneyjrgoijrewoimfioewmrt)
This could be us but you're playing (money money money money)
But shit, that's all I was saying (pussy money pussy titties)

[Verse 2:]
We could be like Cerberus and Hades!
Could be like Solange and Jay-Z
Even I don't know what I'm saying
Instead of saying "Shay, PLEASE!" it's "Shay, please..."
And we could be like Anne Frank and Hiler, Chris Brown and a fist pound
Pikachu and Ash Ketchum, but you give me blue Pokeballs
Toss a condom in the air, girl
Watch how it falls and hit a whore (ooo, ooo, there's one... yep she tossed it back, she ready)
We could've been like Buzz and Woody
'Stead girl, you're in the club, gettin' buzzed and a woody, in ya butt
Krillin's fuckin died a million fuckin' times
But Krillin's still alive, and our love's fuckin' not, hoe

[Hook:]
So back to what I was saying (money make the world go 'round)
This could be us but you're playing (money make the girl go down)
This could be us but you're playing (money make the money go 'round)
I'm high, I hope I don't sound crazy (money make the strippers want money)
Fuck what them bitches was saying (money money money money)
This could be us but you're playing (cash rules everything around me)
This could be us but you're playing (other stuff about money)
But shit, that's all I was saying (paper money stacks paper)

[Bridge:]
Spin the bottle, spin the fuckin' bottle
It's not fuckin AP Chemistry, bitch
Spin the bottle
Truth or dare, nah you don't have no balls
So pick dare, I dare you to spin the fuckin' bottle
Actually no, I don't wanna kiss you, don't spin the bottle
Truth or dare, no, I dare you to take the bottle
And shove it up your butthole, then we won't have no problems
So spin the fuckin bot-idk that bridge is stupid

[Hook:]
So back to what I was saying (money make the money go 'round)
This could be us but you're playing (kle shay this song is stupid)
This could be us but you're playing (i know i'm just really stoned)
I'm high, I hope I don't sound crazy (money make the money go down)
Fuck what them bitches was saying (this mixtape make yo braincells go down)
This could be us but you're playing (money sucks money money)
This could be us but you're playing (i don't even know anymore)
But shit, that's all I was saying (money make yo girl go down)
