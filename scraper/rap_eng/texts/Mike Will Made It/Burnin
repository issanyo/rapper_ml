[Intro: Richie Spice]
Burning, burning, burning, all you do is, all you do is
Burning, burning, burning, all you do is
Burning, burning, burning, all you do is, all you do is
Burning, burning, all you, all you, all you
Burning, burning, burning, all you do is, all you do is
Burning, burning, burning, all you do is
Burning, burning, burning, all you do is, all you do is
Burning, burning, all you, all you, all you

[Verse 1: Andrea]
Yeah, I'ma give 'em what they want
But really don't care if they want it or they don't
'Cause either way all these motherfuckers gotta cope
With the fact that I'm comin' for these niggas in they throat
Nigga, how the game go, put on my payroll
Give 'em a couple grand, count me the pesos
Pop with the rubber bands that I came for
Rockin' Moschino pants with the red toes
We come hard, nigga, if you want beef
I been ticked off, now shit is on eat
Run niggas up like five hundred degrees
Celine shades on, it's five hundred a piece
Niggas best believe, I came to win
I came to conquer, not aim to please
So with the small talk, bitch, just count the cheese
I just stack the chips, get the money then I leave, nigga

[Bridge: Richie Spice & (Andrea)]
Burning, burning, burning (burnin' niggas up)
All you do is, all you do is
Burning, burning, burning (burnin' niggas up)
All you do is
Burning, burning, burning (burnin' niggas up)
All you do is, all you do is
Burning, burning (burnin' niggas up)
All you, all you, all you

[Verse 2: Andrea]
If these bitches really want it, let the shit pop off
Try to play me, get your shit knocked off
Brought the Ramb' in the coupe with the black top off
NIggas really think they 'bout it 'til the first shots off
I get it non stop, so they don't want a problem
What you gon' cop, bitch? I already bought them
Money spring green watch 'em fall like autumn
When the head comes, I just sit back and applaud 'em
Come through, white suit like CO
Either wanna stay, black shades like woah
I'm with the one you bitches fucking like clones
The shit they can't get so they study my flow
This that easy, no bitch could ever seize me
Been on my grind, so the bitches just sleazy
'Cause I've been tryna eat with them up at fashion week
While all y'all wanna suck and fuck and still sleep with them
Only one thing, money what I'm tryna seek
While I'm on my own shit, you niggas one and the same
When it shine, better get the grind to get paid
Tryna play the prophet but don't even know the game
You niggas one and the same
When it shine, better get the grind to get paid
You niggas in the same lane
I've been with it, nigga, fuck is you sayin'?
