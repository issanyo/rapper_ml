(Hook)
I stay up (stay up)
And stay strong
Hell yeah I can do this all night long
I stay up (stay up)
And stay strong
All my homies know I gotta stay on

(Verse 1)
I stay up (stay up)
In the crib (in the crib)
Making lyrics (make lyrics) for a live (for a live)
I stay on
My figures (my figures)
I gotta make sure they can reach they’re new goals
Say hell no to these mama’s especially dem hoes
Cuz all they want to do is get paid on dem poles
They be shaking, and not hesitating
They disrespect themself
For hustler nation

(Hook)
I stay up (stay up)
And stay strong
Hell yeah I can do this all night long
I stay up (stay up)
And stay strong
All my homies know I gotta stay on

(Verse 2)
Wait a minute I’m bossed up
At the top of my crew I stay up
Don’t have time for sleep
Need to wake up
Because I’m trying to get to the top of the lump
I’m standing (i’m standing) on a mill
Ain’t losing this… cuz I wanna work for a bill
If I don’t get my title up
I will run out of time to get my idol up
I’m out here trying get my name out there
YAMINE is Yamine for a fair
So I stay on
My little brothers
I tell them to get there sprites come

(Hook)
I stay up (stay up)
And stay strong
Hell yeah I can do this all night long
I stay up (stay up)
And stay strong
All my homies know I gotta stay on

Hey. hey. Hey. hey. Hey. mhm. Hey. hey. Hey. hey. Hey

(Hook)
I stay up (stay up)
And stay strong
Hell yeah I can do this all night long
I stay up (stay up)
And stay strong
All my homies know I gotta stay on

Uh huh Yamine out here let’s get it
