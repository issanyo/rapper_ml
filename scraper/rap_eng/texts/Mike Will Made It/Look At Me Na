[Intro]
Ear Drummers
Mike WiLL Made-It
Ayy, tell 'em this shit for dope boys only
Mike WiLL Made-It

[Verse 1]
You got it locked
You on the block with that work
You strapped up
That .45 right under your shirt
Your mama tweakin'
She tellin' you to go to church (church)
You noddin' off
'Cause you been sippin' on that syrup
You been payin' killers
Painkillers, you been poppin'
You them same niggas
Who was wreckin' shit and robbin'
Pocket full of money
That shit hangin' out your Robbins
Chopper or the carbon, you been killin' shit for hobby
You a cold nigga
You on that fuck them old niggas (fuck 'em)
You went smashed on the OG and you went and told niggas
If you owed niggas (what?)
Chop it up 'cause you ain't payin' (pull up)
Pull up and you're sprayin', let 'em know you ain't playin'
You with young niggas

[Chorus]
Na na na
One twenty in my mama's room (mama's room)
We was breakin' down dope in the livin' room (in the livin' room)
Big bruh shootin' dice in the other room (in the other room)
I knew I'd be thuggin', na na na
Lot of guns in the other room, na (na na na)
In a kitchen with a fork and spoon, na (na na na)
Dope in the attic, we ran out of room, na (na na na)
Look at me na na (ooh, na na na)

[Verse 2]
I'm straight out of Memphis
I really got it out the mud
And my raps real
I really got it off the drugs
On that Plies shit
I really ran off on the plug
Didn't want to be a rapper, I just wanted to be a thug
Look at God work
This hard work from all work (work)
I'm a superstar but I was a dope boy first
Got a stupid car but buy my mama one first
Bought a stupid watch but made my partner's bond first
One thing about it (what?)
Ain't fucked about no bitch nigga, that hoe out of pocket (pocket)
Think I'ma cut my wrist nigga if I fucked up (never, fucked up)
I'ma go hit a lick nigga (I am)
Then get my ass in 'cause I'm with the shits nigga

[Chorus]
Na na na
One twenty in my mama's room (mama's room)
We was breakin' down dope in the livin' room (in the livin' room)
Big bruh shootin' dice in the other room (in the other room)
I knew I'd be thuggin', na na na
Lot of guns in the other room, na (na na na)
In a kitchen with a fork and spoon, na (na na na)
Dope in the attic, we ran out of room, na (na na na)
Na na na, look at me na na (na na na)

[Outro]
Look at me na na
Look at me na na
