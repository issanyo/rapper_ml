[Intro : Ludwig Goransson]
How dare you walk from me
I'm where I'll always be
It's all downhill from here

[Verse 1 : Vince Staples]
Ice cold, you know? (Ice cold)
I ain't go for broke
No joke, want smoke?
I ain't mad at you dawg
I scrapped before
I'm strapped, compact, I've clapped before
Who want to meet their makers
Who want to meet their saviors
I'm in a big house now
Who never seen their neighbors
Who want to see my greatness
Best believe I'm pay-per-view
Best believe I'm made for few
Boy better shoot, stay dangerous

[Verse 2: Vince Staples]
Who want to meet their makers
Who want to meet their saviors
Who want to see my greatness
Best believe I'm pay-per-view
Best believe I'm made for few
Boy better shoot, stay dangerous
This for the rich and famous
This for the broke and basic
Best stay outta my way
I want it, I take it
I want it, I'm jaded
I want it, I've made it
I'm scoring so you can keep count here
Just don't count me out, yeah
You know?
