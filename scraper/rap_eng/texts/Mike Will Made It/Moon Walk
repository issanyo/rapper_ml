[Chorus: Akon & Gucci Mane]
Moon walk
Beat that pussy up so good
Man, I make that bitch moon walk (huh)
Sliding up and down that wood
Shoulda seen that hoe moon walk
Screaming out, "Daddy, you so good"
Watching you getting to it
'Cause you's a freak, and I knew it
Fucking it backwards and forwards and sideways (hee, hee)
That pussy be sore for like five days (hee, hee)
Oh, moon walk, beat that pussy up so good
Man, I made that bitch moon walk, moon walk (huh, huh, let's go)

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
Gucci Mane's a smooth criminal
Billy Jean is not my lover (damn)
But I'm so motherfuckin' hot
I got Elvis Presley's precious daughter (wow)
You can be my baby
It don't matter if you're black or yellow (no)
Balmain jeans and matchin' sweaters
Moon walkin' in Maison Margielas (yeah)
King of Pop, come rock with me
Show you who bad, I beat it, beat it
Takin' all kind of prescription pills
Like Michael Jack, I'm super geekin' (geekin')
Super freaky, gangster geechie
Gucci give you that gangster love (Wop, Wop)
Diamonds dancin' on my pinky
Like it's Michael Jackson's glove
Like Janet Jackson, scream for me (burr, burr)
Like Joe Jackson, I'll slap ya up
I'm dangerous, I'm off the wall
It's Thriller when I'm in the club (burr, burr)
Beat that pussy so good
That she use the same ad-libs Michael does (hee-hee)
Now turn around and back it up

[Chorus: Chris Brown & Gucci Mane]
Moon, moon walk
Beat that pussy up so good
Man, I made that bitch moon walk
Sliding up and down that pole (damn)
Look at that girl moon walk
You screaming "Oh, baby, you so good" (oh)
And I'm watching you getting to it
You a freak, and I knew it
Backwards and forwards and sideways (hee, hee)  (damn)
That pussy be sore for like five days (hee, hee)
Moon walk, beat that pussy up so good (huh)
Man, I made that bitch moon walk, moon walk (Wop, go)

[Verse 2: Gucci Mane]
Caucasian women, Black women (ha, ha)
Spanish, Russian, Asian women (yeah)
Fall out when I touch their hand (yeah)
They rush the stage like Michael did it (yeah)
Live my life like Michael Jackson (yeah)
Made more stars than Michael Bivins (damn)
Like Michael Jordan, livin' legend
I'm the best that ever did it (it's Gucci)
White diamonds, Elizabeth Taylor (burr, burr)
White folks money crazy paper
Vegas mansion, Cali ranches
Monkeys, tigers, zebras, pandas (damn)
Giraffes and panthers, I'm so handsome
On stage with a hundred dancers
I got so much fuckin' money
I could buy one hundred Phantoms (Ghost)
I'm Jackson 5, but Gucci dolo
I'm so dope, I'm goin' solo (yeah)
I'm so high, might pull a no-show
So leaned out, need take a lodo (faded)
That's your hoe but she a thot though
She just moon walked through the door though
I'm The Wiz and you the Scarecrow
This ain't Motown but I want some more dough

[Chorus: Akon, Chris Brown & Gucci Mane]
Moon walk (huh, huh)
Beat that pussy up so good
Man, I make that bitch moon walk (ooh)
Sliding up and down that wood (huh)
Shoulda seen that hoe moon walk
Screaming out, "Daddy, you so good" (wow)
Watching you getting to it
'Cause you's a freak, and I knew it
Backwards and forwards and sideways (hee, hee) (damn, damn)
That pussy be sore for like five days (hee, hee)
Moon walk, beat that pussy up so good (huh)
Man, I made that bitch moon walk, moon walk

[Outro: Gucci Mane]
