I smoke a lot of green, call it Asparagus
Fuck the Police and the Sheriff bitch!
We smoke a lot of green, call it Asparagus
They tryna judge my team, they call us terrorists

[Verse 1: CrackTheSafe]
Smokin' weed 'cause I'm stressed out
Break it down take the stems out
Half a kilo for ten thou
Imma turn that shit to a penthouse...
Heard this hater tryna flex now (huh??)
Heard this hater tryna flex now? (who?)
Heard this hater got a Benz now
Heard this hater got a dent now
Let me paint you a narrative (shhh)
It's CrackTheSafe: no comparison
I ain't tryna be arrogant
But I'm in the air like I'm Harrison
Parents think I'm an embarrassment
Doctors think I need a therapist
Government thinkin' I'm a terrorist
I'm like "oh my God they might be scared of this"
I'm takin' off in these pair of kicks
They hatin' on my heritage (why you hatin?)
Gotta grind just to get some asparagus (money)
'cause I started from the bottom, no inheritance (money)
So I gotta get this money like a robbery (mula)
Yeah I gotta get this money like a lottery (mula)
KeepitG Records in the muthafuckin' buildin' and we bout to get that money like monopoly (mula) YAHH

[Verse 2: Rebel Pops]
Open up the window let out weed smoke
Bitches love my voice they say I speak dope
I'm usin' auto-tune, I'm hittin' each note...
I'm prayin' for y'all haters 'cause y'all need hope...
I'm gettin' hella money I'm on a viscous grind
I hit it from the back she got a twisted spine
...and you should've known that this bitch is fine
...and if she actin' up I tell her "get in line!"
