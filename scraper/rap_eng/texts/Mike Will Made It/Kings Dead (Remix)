(KILO) - aye ian got no time for the bs
Niggas know that i’m the coolest
Ima criminal like mike
I’m the smoothest
Think i’m worried competition then you foolish
Ian had time to hear yo new shit
Cuz ain’t no off days when u do this
Woahhh why these niggas
Prioritize paper and materials
That could never make you greater to yo superiors
What woruld be doing if money ain’t exist
I’d still be writing rhymes in the abyss
Coming for em like a demon in the wind
Like a ninja hidden in the mist
Ian worried bout getting rich
I just love doing this shit
Oh ya think harder than me
Well you might be smarter
I’m still ya father ya see
All these niggas
Got me on they necklace
If you i told you i was jesus
You might sell it
No lies i be the king 2 the mf throne
No mercy like ye'
Sippin act i just love taste
And yea i beat that case
Look in the mirror i see god
Look up at the ceiling i see stars
What are these i believe bars
Ain’t no future
Just every lasting moments
Gripped the world by the reigns
Now i own it
Fuck the competition
Fuck my opponent
He a fan but idk even know him
Put me on the court
Can’t hold me
Pull up like i’m kobe
Skin a nigga top
Like ginobili
Feel like ai in 03
Killin myself slowly
Nodding off on codiene
Tried to thank god ian od
Now he act he don’t know me
Nigga im comin up slowly
Ha don’t try 2 hold me
Bitch nigga u just don’t know
I have all your souls yea
Devil at my high
God at lows
Yea yea
Ian got no friends
Ian got no foes
Take a lil break
An you think you next up
See you struggling
Tryna get them bars like a hiccup
Don’t make a sound
My killas hit the corner
With they sticks up
Take a break
They say the kings dead
But i’m here bruh
Foot on ya neck
Like give it up
Im everything you wanna be
So pay me w respect
And if a nigga hatin it’s fuck what he said
Purge his whole family just to leave him in debt
Ar W da red beam just might crash the whole fuckin lobby
Population control
Dare a mf try to stop me
Run up then you droppin
Got a whole cult behind me
They think we illuminati
Bust a nigga brain
Skrt off in a hell cat
Idgaf u can tell 12 i said dat
Fuck a nigga bitch
Make her snatch his necklace
What i can i say i’m reckless
Don’t tell me i should know better
Cuz all the bitches
Sending shots at me
So tell me what makes u so special
