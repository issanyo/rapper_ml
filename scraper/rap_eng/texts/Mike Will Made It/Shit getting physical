[Intro: Malik]
Its fucked up man…
Fuck all you bitch ass niggas that turned on me (fuck em)
Thats really how I feel on this shit man

[Verse 1: Malik]
Why niggas keep testing my patience
They don’t believe that’ll turn you into some patients
I want some tall money like Yao Ming
Break up with your girl, she was just a summer fling yea
Ballin with the team, no Capo
Ya girl a freak ting, no cap tho
Smoking all night, I’m feeling mellow
We all coolin in OKC, no Melo
Who the fuck gon stop me?
Young nigga, and I’m so cocky
Bring it back girl like you twerkin
Hoes laugh that you a stripper, I’m just proud that you working
Bills paid, rent paid, cell phone bill paid
Hair done, nails did, pussy good you got it made
Lost a couple pounds, but you bad no matter how you weighed
You gotta nigga on his teflon shit, some untouchable Bishop Don Juan shit
Sauce it up, KJ got them grippys tucked
So if a nigga act up, we goin shoot it up
Test my gangsta if you want to, but bitching me is something that you won’t do yeah

[Hook: Malik]
Shit getting critical, I would love for this shit to get physical
You can call me all the names you want to
But putting ya hands on me what you won’t do

Yeah shit getting critical, I would love for this shit to get physical
You can call me all the names you want to
But putting ya hands on me what won’t do nigga

[Verse 2: Kyim Jordan]
Lil K
Gotta go that way. Bitch gotta go that way (bitch)
Roach in the ashtray. Aim 38 in his black face
Roll ‘round nigga, got that pump in the pass seat
These cop tryna catch me, but its hot when I got the heat on me
Drug dealers, rich niggas
Fucking with us, cause they see we getting figures
Your bitch I fingered
She wanna go get dinner
I’m killing shit, Hitler
These niggas rats, Splinter
Stop playing on my phone with that hating shit
That bitter shit. That Tekashi shit
My whole gang finna blow up on some Saudi shit
My nigga lost his life, still shot back, on some zombie shit

[Hook: Malik]
Shit getting critical, I would love for this shit to get physical
You can call me all the names you want to
But putting ya hands on me what you won’t do

Yeah shit getting critical, I would love for this shit to get physical
You can call me all the names you want to
But putting ya hands on me what won’t do nigga
