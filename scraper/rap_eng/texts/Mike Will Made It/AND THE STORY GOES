"I'm terrified at the moral apathy, the death of the heart, which is happening in my country. These people have deluded themselves for so long that they really don't think I'm human. I base this on their conduct, not what they say. And this means that they have become, in themselves, moral monsters."
-James Baldwin


Hook:
And the story goes:
I was just a dollar to you
Then you left me hanging
Like a follow through do
Do you, do you like strange fruit cocktails?
Difference 'tween you and D'evils I cannot tell
Let me tell you, let me tell you, let me tell you like
We surrounded by these moral monsters
We surrounded by these moral monsters
We surrounded by these moral monsters
We surrounded
We surrounded
We surrounded
We surrounded by these moral monsters
We surrounded by these moral monsters
We surrounded by these moral monsters
We surrounded
We surrounded
We surrounded

Verse 1:
What's your boy to do
It's unavoidable to get hated on
According to them forms and rules
I'm melanated wrong
Three five, three five, three five
I'm barely human in your mind, ain't I?
Dark skin, it ain't like you
But I'm a child of the divine ain't I?
You don't see blood
You don't see tears
You don't see me
You only see animal
You don't see love
You don't see fear
You ain't even free
You more like a cannibal
I know you better than you know me though
You ain't even seen my eyes
So when I call you on the okie doke
Don't you be backing up your lies

Bridge:
Breaking down your plan 'til it's all gone
Ain't no shaking of the hands 'cause you all wrong
Nightmares, fangs, claws, horns got me tripping
Wishing it was different but I'm dealing with the realness

(Hook)

Verse 2:
Staring right into the eyes of the beast
Rough skin from the crown to the feet
Yellow goo start to ooze out the teeth
Salivating steady ready for a feast
And you revel in your readiness to eat
Are you present to the devil in your feet?
Rather settle for defeat
Than to pedel for the peace
There's a level up, believe
But you're tethered to a thief
Your fear is destroying you
It's unavoidable to turn monstrous
Where your heart go?
You done turned cold
You need to realign your chakras
People don't pay no attention to prophets
Unless it's for profit and then they about it
Check the new cotton and who advertises
And don't be surprised when uprises get violent

(Bridge)
