[Hook: Waka Flocka Flame & Slim Dunkin]
Let's do it, let's go
Let's do it, let's go
Let's do it, let's go
Let's do it, let's go
Let's do it, let's go
Let's do it, let's go
These niggas say they want beef
Let's do it, let's go

[Verse 1: Slim Dunkin]
Nigga, I ain't finna play
Don't give a fuck what you finna say
Shawty like that grandmama cream
Y'all niggas been gay
Flexing ass nigga, stop putting on with them tacos
Them cheesy ass kicks, all you need is some nachos
Nah, I ain't the first to say, but yeah, I'm the first to spray
Red flag on me, but I feel like rocking blue today
Do what the fuck I'm wanna do
Say it, then I'm gonna do
Why y'all niggas fuck with me?
'Cause nigga, I don't fuck with you
I ain't got no sympathy, y'all niggas can't do shit to me
I'm a hundred percent, y'all niggas ain't a tenth of me
If there's beef, I'm cocking pistols, tying up my Timbs
Y'all niggas copping deuces like you trying to buy a rim

[Hook: Waka Flocka Flame & Slim Dunkin]
Let's do it, let's go
Let's do it, let's go
Let's do it, let's go
Let's do it, let's go
Let's do it, let's go
Let's do it, let's go
These niggas say they want beef
Let's do it, let's go

[Verse 2: Waka Flocka Flame]
I'm handing out dope to J's like they party flyers
I'll murk your whole family like I'm Michael Flocka Myers
I love tricking, it ain't nothing, nigga
What the fuck you think? It'll have your left side missing
Weed for free, bitch, that'll get you murked quick
That Benz keep spinning rims, going helicopter
Acting like juggernauts, that'll get your muscles shot
I'm dumping at your face, bullets swimming in your waist
Smoking out the pound, all the girls on my dick
I fucked Tisha, I fucked Lisa, and I did it at the same time
Love the triple threat sex, a nigga stay horny
Got that Glock on me, what? Number forty

[Hook: Waka Flocka Flame & Slim Dunkin]
Let's do it, let's go
Let's do it, let's go
Let's do it, let's go
Let's do it, let's go
Let's do it, let's go
Let's do it, let's go
These niggas say they want beef
Let's do it, let's go

[Verse 3: Slim Dunkin]
Ain't no second guessing me
Yeah, I got the best with me
And I got that recipe
I'll crunch them like a Nestle
Y'all niggas wanna be me
Flow magic like a genie
Front me the work
I'll disappear like Whodini
Bubble gum shit, we chew it up and we spit it out
Purse got your swagger right, fuck these niggas talking 'bout
You ain't blood, you ain't raw
Don't know who you are
You best give up your scent to me
Y'all niggas can't get rid of me
You said you want beef? Then a massacre it finna be
So Icey is a union, fuck is you doing?
Can't find you, we shoot up your reunion
[?] 'cause it's all that
Dressed up, all black
Fuck that, all red
Red dot, y'all heads
All shook, all scared
Don't leave, all dead
I ain't here to fuss or fight
I ain't give you what you like
You try me today and I bet it's going down tonight

[Hook: Waka Flocka Flame & Slim Dunkin]
Let's do it, let's go
Let's do it, let's go
Let's do it, let's go
Let's do it, let's go
Let's do it, let's go
Let's do it, let's go
These niggas say they want beef
Let's do it, let's go
Let's do it, let's go
Let's do it, let's go
Let's do it, let's go
Let's do it, let's go
Let's do it, let's go
Let's do it, let's go
These niggas say they want beef
Let's do it, let's go
