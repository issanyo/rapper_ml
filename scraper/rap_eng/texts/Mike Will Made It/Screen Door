[Hook: Bankroll Fresh]
Comin' up, I knew that one day I'd be the man
Started out sackin' up grams at Gram's
Nigga had a plan soon as the money hit my hand
Time to expand, it's time to advance
Workin' out the door, hold dope, whole sold out
Cameras see you roll out, come in, purchase a whole lot
See you through the screen door, we ain't gotta keep the door locked
Cause the .44 pop, pop, pop, pop, bop

[Verse 1: Bankroll Fresh]
Young nigga got a swag like no other
Run off we extort your brother
Pull up right there where your mother
Until your bitch ass discover
These niggas play undercover
That's why I could never trust you
You know that these streets ain't for you
I came here to make it double
Blue hundreds, they're stuck together
My stones invisible set 'em
Get wrong pussy, we'll check 'em
Boy, hoes I got several
If I fuck, they'll let yah
They call me the street's professor
I came here to give a lecture
Wintertime month, that sweater
Matchin' the Margiela
I'm fresher than whoever
I'm trappin' out the ghetto
Hotter than a tea kettle
I got racks on my schedule
Mike WiLL, he blessed the beat
Street money, bless the streets

[Hook: Bankroll Fresh]
Comin' up, I knew that one day I'd be the man

Cameras see you roll out, come in, purchase a whole lot
See you through the screen door, we ain't gotta keep the door locked
Cause the .44 pop, pop, pop, pop, bop

[Verse 2: Bankroll Fresh]
I came from the era where niggas trappin' to get it
I'm from the era where we turn quarters to fities
You from the era where niggas too lazy to get it
These niggas layin' down
They gettin' outworked by the bitches
Me I keep this shit consistent
My card don't got no limit, I'm spendin'
I'm with your bitch, it's none of your business
Know that my cars is tinted, you dig it?
I love money and plenty of women
Jesus piece, forgive me for sinnin', (forgive me for sinnin')
Jesus piece is on me, goddamn I'm gettin' it
