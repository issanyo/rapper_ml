[Intro]
Ear Drummers
My niggas ride like Al-Qaeda
Mike Will made it
My niggas ride like Al-Qaeda
My niggas ride like Al-Qaeda
My niggas ride like Al-Qaeda
My niggas ride like Al-Qaeda
My niggas ride like Al-Qaeda

[Chorus]
My niggas ride like Al-Qaeda
You think it's cheaper to keep her
You think it's cheaper to keep her
I ride with dope like it's legal
My niggas strapped with Osama
My niggas strapped with Osama
My niggas strapped with Osama
My niggas strapped with Osama
The young niggas strapped with Osama
The young niggas strapped with Osama
The strap niggas strapped with Osama
The young niggas strapped with the rrra-rrra

[Verse 1]
You niggas ain't nothin' but bitch niggas
You niggas ain't nothin' but snitch niggas
You niggas ain't nothin' but hoe niggas
You niggas ain't nothin' but broke niggas
Wanna come around, act like you don't know niggas
Ima let the .44 kiss ya, Ima let my bottom hoe hit ya
I be hangin' round some toe-taggers
Had ya smellin like some clam chowder
Transport 'em like a space pilot
I got bands on me, ain't got no wallet
I got xans on me, I got plenty molly
Got some young niggas & they suicidal
Got my young nigga that's my Julianny[?]
Hit ya with the nickle fuck a snowbunny
Hit ya with the nickle have ya soul runnin'
I just walk around with a check
She just fucked my friend for a check
I know money mean everything to you baby, but you gotta have respect

[Chorus]
My niggas ride like Al-Qaeda
You think it's cheaper to keep her
You think it's cheaper to keep her
I ride with dope like it's legal
My niggas strapped with Osama
My niggas strapped with Osama
My niggas strapped with Osama
My niggas strapped with Osama
The young niggas strapped with Osama
The young niggas strapped with Osama
The strap niggas strapped with Osama
The young niggas strapped with the rrra-rrra

[Verse 2]
I'm strapped like Osama, my pocket got llamas
I'm fresh in balmains
I trapped out the hummers, say fuck all that drama
I'm bustin' ya brain
Ain't trustin' you bitches, ain't trustin' these bitches
They fuckin' for fame
Ain't no love for your niggas, no love for these bitches
No love in this game
Used to steal at the store, used to skip out of school
Nigga jump on the train
I go fuck on your hoe, nigga fuck being broke
I got money I'm made
I go stand on that corner, won't never afraid
I was never afraid
I go hit up a lick, I go jugg off a brick
I got money to make
I got ways to get paid
I get straight to that check, I was crazy depressed
I get money i'm fresh
You didn't know I was stressed, you my nigga for life

[Chorus]
My niggas ride like Al-Qaeda
You think it's cheaper to keep her
You think it's cheaper to keep her
I ride with dope like it's legal
My niggas strapped with Osama
My niggas strapped with Osama
My niggas strapped with Osama
My niggas strapped with Osama
The young niggas strapped with Osama
The young niggas strapped with Osama
The strap niggas strapped with Osama
The young niggas strapped with the rrra-rrra
