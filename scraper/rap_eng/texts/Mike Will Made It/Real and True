Messy sheets all over bed
I crawl upon your warm chest instead
Not really sure
How you feel
But baby know
That this is real

We vibing in the frequency
Of your fast beating heart
Relax baby, I'm not gonna go hard
Lets calm you down

For a start, Imma climb on you
As if you're a Billboard chart
Take you where you need to be
Show you what you need to feel
Yeah..

I want to take you
Somewhere with no space nor time
Baby Im yours
I want you to be mine

Messy sheets all over bed
I crawl upon your warm chest instead
Not really sure
How you feel
But baby know
That this is real

This is real
This is real
