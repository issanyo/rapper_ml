[Intro]
Mmmm, yeah
Goodbye

[Verse 1]
We never said that we would be perfect
We only said that we'd try
And when you said that we were forever
I guess it's just another lie
Let me slip right through your fingers
I hope you know it's real this time, yeah
You know that I said I'd never come home for a last goodbye, yeah

[Chorus]
I don’t wanna let you go if you still love me
'Cause I don’t wanna see you cry, yeah
But it feels like you and I are dying
And there’s no one that can save our lives, yeah
And I know we're sick and tired of fighting
Sick and tired of being sick and tired, yeah
But I know that you're gonna want me to come home for a last goodbye

[Post-Chorus]
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, aye
Bye-ye-ye, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

[Verse 2]
Laying in the dark with you against me
I can't even open my eyes
'Cause the pain has outweighed the pleasure
Don't think I can take another night
How has my best friend become such a stranger?
It seemed like everything was fine
We've already been through this twice
And I'm never coming home for a last goodbye

[Chorus]
I don’t wanna let you go if you still love me
'Cause I don’t wanna see you cry, yeah
But it feels like you and I are dying
And there’s no one that can save our lives, yeah
And I know we're sick and tired of fighting
Sick and tired of being sick and tired, yeah
But I know that you're gonna want me to come home for a last goodbye

[Post-Chorus]
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, aye
Bye-ye-ye, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

[Breakdown]
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, yeah
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, yeah

[Chorus]
I don’t wanna let you go if you still love me
'Cause I don’t wanna see you cry, yeah
But it feels like you and I are dying
And there’s no one that can save our lives, yeah
And I know we're sick and tired of fighting
Sick and tired of being sick and tired, yeah
But I know that you're gonna want me to come home for a last goodbye

[Post-Chorus]
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, aye
Bye-ye-ye, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

[Outro]
You let me down
I gave you up
I took you back
I guess I can't blame ya for this when I told myself
I’ll never say that last goodbye
I'll never say...
That last goodbye
