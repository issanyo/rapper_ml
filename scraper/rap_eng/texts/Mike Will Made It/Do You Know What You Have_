[Intro]
They say you don't know shen you're losing a good thing
Until it's gone
And I sometimes think to myself
Does he know?

[Verse 1]
Now all I hear you say is don't stop
Did, did you forget that?
What's that look on your face, are you surprised?
You act like you can't believe this
Go on and lay your head back (what?)
While I set it off (what?)
What you thinking about (what?)
Is it me or her? (what?)
You say you'll never leave (what?)
I ain't insecure (what?)
What you yelling for? (oh)
Already?

[Chorus]
Do you know what you got here?
Do you know?
Do you know what you got here?
Do you know?
Do you know what you got here?
Do you know?
Do you know what you got here?
Do you know?

[Verse 2]
I don't think you recognize love
I'm certified, ride or die trust
Why do I have to ask? (what?)
Is it good enough? (what?)
Don't you see in me (what?)
How much I'm meaningful (what?)
Take a bullet for ya (what?)
If I had to (what?)
Take my heart from me
Might point it at you

[Chorus]
Do you know what you got here ?
Do you know?
Do you know what you got here?
Do you know?
Do you know what you got here?
Do you know?
Do you know what you got here?
Do you know?

[Bridge]
If you forget what's waiting here
You changed your mind but
You're free to go, just do me a favor
Leave your keys on the table
If you forgot what (ghe way this feels)
You changed your mind, boy
You're free to go, yeah, yeah
Does he know?

[Chorus]
Do you know what you got here?
(Do you know what you got here?)
Do you know?
Do you know what you got here? (in here)
Do you know? (do you know?)
Do you know what you got here?
(I don't think you see what you've got in me)
Do you know?
Do you know what you got here?
Do you know?
