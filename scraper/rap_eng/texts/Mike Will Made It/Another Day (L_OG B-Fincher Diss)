[Intro:Yamine]
Yamine, Fudge. EAST ATLANTA!!!!!! ZONE 3 My Nigga!!!! HAHAHAHA!

[Verse 1: Yamine]
Verses after verses
Curses after curses
Making new songs at StoneTree on purpose
I don't care, cuz I purchased
Another day out, I go fill her purses
I don't know what I'm talkin' bout
It's just words that come out my mouth
I'm from Zone 3, Pontiac Street
Yeah that's down south
I don't care what you thinkin about
We getting bitches and don't give a doubt
My momma always told me to get what you get and don't ever pout (what)
She go on a walk?
Bros go out and stalk
They back in the Penitentiary
Because they had no thought
That pussy wasn't worth it
You mad cuz she went tourin
Now you in a cell, because you wasn't important
It's not my fault
You up in that crap
It wasn't my fault that your game is so wack
Yes I'm talking crap
Once you get out I'm coming back
I kept a low profile and silent for five years
Now you coming out, and I'll have you in some tears
Ha ha

[Bridge: Fudge]
All I do is fuck bitches and get paid
I never gave a damn, on what a hater gotta say
I work real hard and I walk like a slave
This ain't nothing NEWWW! It's just another day

[Hook: Fudge]
Just another day
Just another day
Just another day. day. day. day. day
Oooh
Just another day
Just another day
Just another day. day. day. day. day
Oooh. just another day
