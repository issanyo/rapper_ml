If somebody is fucking with my familly
I probably will got to get in a street fight
I knows that thers a lot of crimes
But all of this fight are tiny coneccted with me

For just one sanddwich these motherfucker been fighting
Ayy, I've been fighting for my 'lil bitch
To she sits on my dickness
Like I've been acting as I'm the strongest
But only one time I will be the wickest

Ayy, If I lost a fight, I won't be alive more, ayy
Ayy, I could try inpress her, ayy with my beutyness, ayy
But most of these girls been inpress under a lit fight, ayy

Kodie is my main stright
After her look I would need a CPR
So, than we goes like
You and I knows
Bitch don't be agressive more, ayy (yeah, yeah)

Left chick, right chick, back chick, front flip
But now my name is not Phillip, ayy, aye
I should switch the channel, ayy, ayy
MacShanell on a TV, ayy, ayy
Than I see the Black Sea, aye
On a Moto TV is BMW M3, ayy
But I remember, If I quit your BM, I still ride Mercedes, funk, aye, yeah

I don't think about these haters (No More)
They just been looking like an ATARS
I don't take care of these demonstrators
Cause they been just indicating, ayy
I'm singing this because I think I will be depresive
Too I got that feeling I need to see more degressive
But than you show me somehing that make me possessive, ayy, yeah, yeah

Going to the front door is like a Ranodo
Magestic by your Condo
Is it you Fernando
Ayy, I can blow up with my money, ayy kids been eating bread and honney, ayy
I can boast up with my iPhone, ayy but nobody seen that it is a my phone, ayy
Ayy, your pussy is a dry zone, ayy I can boast it to be fire zone
Ayy, you leave me to die alone, ayy but only you been sitting on a throne

Kodie is my main stright
After her look I would need a CPR
So, than we goes like
You and I knows
Bitch don't be agressive more, ayy (yeah, yeah)

Left chick, right chick, back chick, front flip
But now my name is not Phillip, ayy, aye
I should switch the channel, ayy, aye
MacShanell on a TV, ayy, ayy
Than I see the Black Sea, aye
On a Moto TV is BMW M3, ayy
But I remember, If I quit your BM, I still ride Mercedes, funk, aye, yeah
