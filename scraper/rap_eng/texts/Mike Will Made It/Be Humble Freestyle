BE HUMBLE

These bitches the weakest

Not believe this
(Noooooo)

[Cassidy]
Ay, I remember tuna sandwiches and buying cans of fish
Now one picks a nigga hands and wrist it looks like ?
Before I had a record deal with a legal team and managers
I was moving grams of piff that was stickier than bandages
I'm still undefeated my last battle was unanimous
Ask the analyst, he can't recover from the damages
Before I was getting bands from this, I was a fan of this
Back when I thought that Canibus was hot as grandma grits
How you think he hot and you can't even understand his shit
I can't stand this shit, because I can't tell if he a man or bitch
Take it in their booty, niggas fruity as banana splits
Just like prostitutes but they say they shoot and got banana clips
If my trigger finger on my hand will itch, my hand will lift
Extended clips, in the cannon bitch and I don't plan to miss
P.M to the A.M, A.M to the P.M (Grind!)
Promo touring I remember that po-dium (Grind!)
Now I'm touring stadiums and coliseums (Grind!)
Until i'm gone I'm sure that you gone' probably see him (Grind!)
My freestyle just went vi-ral
Bars back, it's a wrap just like Gyro
I get paper in Abu dhabi and Dubai though
If you a hater you can die slow

If he mumble .... Tell him sit down
If he mumble .... Tell him sit down
If he mumble .... Tell him sit down
If he mumble .... Tell him sit down


.... Tell him sit down .... Tell him sit down
