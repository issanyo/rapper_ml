Young boy
Betta do some research
Fuck around &
End up on a t shirt
I'on hit
'Less you hit me first
And I ain't did that since beepers
Trying to hang around with the creepers
Get found in the ground with the sleepers
Pound to the ground with some sneakers
Nike, or the puma, or Adidas
15 for the show & the feature
Trying to drop hits like Tinker
Can't shoot now
I'm a thinker
Get another hitta on the speaker
Tell'em this dude is a tweaker
Winter time
Time to buy heaters
Shout out to the robbers &
The robbers only
Been out the game
For a minute now
Shout out to guys that a
Snatch ya homie
And will stay quiet when
The sentence down
Pour a lil liquor
For the deceased
Can't knock your view
I'm not in these streets
I went to school
& hoped on these beats
Now that I'm thru
It's all on me
Been that way for
A minute
Gotta apologize to the fam
Greatness
Can't be rushed
Was trying to figure out who I am
Since I am a God (me & the squad)
Beat all of the odds
& This is the start
I gotta work hard
So we Can get far
Can I get a break
Shit
God damn!
