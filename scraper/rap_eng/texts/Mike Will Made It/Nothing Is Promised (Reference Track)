[Intro]
Mike WiLL Made-It

[Chorus: Future]
Ain't none of this shit promised, ain't none of this promised
Ain't none of this shit promised, ain't none of this promised
Ain't none of this shit certain, ain't none of this certain
Ain't none of us perfect, I hope it was worth it

[Verse 1: Future]
Shoppin' in Paris (yeah)
We gon' go shoppin' in Paris, nigga (we goin', we goin')
They can't even compare us (no)
They can't even compare us, we're rarer than niggas
Rarer than niggas
I never'd imagine this shit comin' (I never imagined)
This shit comin'
We swimmin' in money, we drownin' in hundreds (yeah, yeah)
Ayy, I keep a duffle bag on me like Tity Boi and Dolla (duffle bag, duffle bag)
Where I'm from, these niggas they'd murder for a dolla' (murda, murda)
For a fresh pair of Jordans and some new Balenciagas (murda)
I'm in love with the kush, I put that on my mama and father

[Chorus: Future]
Ain't none of this shit promised, ain't none of this promised
Ain't none of this shit promised, ain't none of this promised
Ain't none of this shit certain, ain't none of this certain
Ain't none of us perfect, I hope it was worth it

[Verse 2: Future]
Goin' to France (yeah)
We gon' vacation in France, nigga (yeah!)
Advanced niggas
Can't nobody stop me, I'm past niggas
I'm past my limit
I'm drunk and I'm blowin' a whole lot of gas, nigga (yeah)
Ten million in cash (cash)
Put up in a stash, it's under my mattress (yeah, yeah)
Ayy, I put the money in the ground like my nigga Frank Lucas (Frank Lucas)
Got a turbo Porsche and I don't even move it (skrrt)
I'm back on the lean, it's so hard not to use it (pour up)
I'm continuously winnin', my nigga, I can't see me losin'

[Chorus: Future]
Ain't none of this shit promised, ain't none of this promised
Ain't none of this shit promised, ain't none of this promised
Ain't none of this shit certain, ain't none of this certain
Ain't none of us perfect, I hope it was worth it

[Verse 3: Future]
Go to Australia, leavin' Dubai we go to Australia
They gotta pay us, just to come visit they gotta pay us, nigga
Waking up everyday, everyday, everyday, everyday makin' a film
Niggas be braggin' bout shit that they doin', honestly I never see 'em
I keep cash money on me like Birdman Slim
You might catch me in a whip and it cost me a mil
With a choppa on seat like a nigga in the field
While y'all countin' these hunnids, I'm holding back tears

[Chorus: Future]
Ain't none of this shit promised, ain't none of this promised
Ain't none of this shit promised, ain't none of this promised
Ain't none of this shit certain, ain't none of this certain
Ain't none of us perfect, I hope it was worth it

[Outro: Future]
Ain't none of this promised, ain't none of this promised (nope, no no)
Ain't nothin' in life guaranteed, put that on my mama (I put that on my mama)
Ain't none of this shit promised, ain't none of this (none of this)
Ain't none of it promised
Ain't none of this certain, not even one of us perfect (yeah)
Ain't none of this shit promised, ain't none of this (woo)
Ain't none of this promised (turn up)
Ain't none of this shit promised, ain't none of this (none of this)
Ain't none of this promised
Runnin' the counter inside of the studio, rapping and praying
You can see nothing but VVS all in my neck and my wrist and my hands
(You can see nothing but the VVS all in my neck and my wrist and my hands, hey)
I love the money, yeah I love you money
I'ma never put nothing above this money
I'ma wake up and then hug this money, yeah yeah
