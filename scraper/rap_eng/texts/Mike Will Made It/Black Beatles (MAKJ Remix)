[Intro: Swae Lee]
Black Beatles in the city
Be back immediately to confiscate the moneys
(Ear Drummers)

[Hook: Swae Lee]
That girl is a real crowd pleaser
Small world, all her friends know of me
Young bull livin' like an old geezer
Quick release the cash, watch it fall slowly
Frat girls still tryna get even
Haters mad for whatever reason
Smoke in the air, binge drinking
They lose it when the DJ drops the needle

[Bridge: Swae Lee]
Black Beatles in the city
Be back immediately to confiscate the moneys

[Hook: Swae Lee]

Small world, all her friends know of me
Young bull livin' like an old geezer
Quick release the cash, watch it fall slowly
Frat girls still tryna get even

They lose it when the DJ drops the needle
