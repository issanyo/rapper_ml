[Chorus]
Ma ain't raise no fuckin' fool
I'mma go and get the cheese, nigga
Take the who and leave the what? (what?)
Get the muthafuckin' weed, nigga
Get the dope and get the weed, nigga
Get the cash and get the weed, nigga
Get the dope and get the weed, nigga
Get everything before you leave, nigga
Tell em' pull across the track
Hope you ain't spooked of the front line
Youngins they posted on front line
Let ya lil patna shine one time
He keep talkin' bout wait but the time is now
He keep talkin' bout wait but the time is now
He keep talkin' bout wait but the time is now

[Verse 1]
Don't cross that gun line (gun line)
Just tryna get my dope staked up from one time
Nah stop your begging (nah nah nah)
You tried to count me out think I wouldn't catch it (tuh)
I stayed down, I prayed up, I knew I would get it
No matter, I shall, I just knew I would get it
You lovin' the bitches who I was just sluttin' duke (dummy)
I promise to God that I was just tryna get it, you hatin
Know to keep that lil' distance
Know I shoot better than lil' homie from Pistons do
Wet, like the ice cream (wet)
Bitch wet, try your life lame (don't go out like that)
Fire be retarded hoe
Bitches fire on my damn name (damn, that's okay)
Still fire on my rider hoe (fire, still strapped)
When I was sinkin' you jumped off my boat (went got ghost)
I remember everything
Bitch I'm drinking everything
Somebody got clean, somebody got beans
Young hitter right off the back of that boat
Whole team tryna get the Ms
Whole team tryna get the
Somebody got beats, somebody got freaks
Somebody got sum
Whole team tryna get them Ms
Whole team tryna get the, Ms

[Chorus]
Ma ain't raise no fuckin' fool
I'mma go and get the cheese, nigga
Take the who and leave the what? (what?)
Get the muthafuckin' weed, nigga
Get the dope and get the weed, nigga
Get the cash and get the weed, nigga
Get the dope and get the weed, nigga
Get everything before you leave, nigga
Tell em' pull across the track
Hope you ain't spooked of the front line
Youngins they posted on front line
Let ya lil patna shine one time
He keep talkin' bout wait but the time is now
He keep talkin' bout wait but the time is now
He keep talkin' bout wait but the time is now
He keep talkin' bout
