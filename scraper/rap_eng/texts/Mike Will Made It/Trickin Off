[Hook – 2 Chainz]
It ain’t tricking off, it ain’t tricking off
This ain’t tricking off, this ain’t tricking off
Money, I got that
Hoes, I got that
Flows, I got that
Clothes, I got that
It ain’t tricking off, it ain’t tricking off
This ain’t tricking off, this ain’t tricking off

[Verse 1 – 2 Chainz]
It ain’t tricking, bitch I got it
Get em, got em
Spoil my girl rotten
Every weekend I like to take my girl shopping
Every day is Valentines, here go your chocolate
Money, I got that
Hoes, I got that
Flows, I got that
Clothes, I got that
It ain’t tricking nigga, figure we can kick it nigga
Serve some niggas chicken dinners like we was at Mrs. Winners
She winning, she wishing more women
I tell them girls to get in, oh hell yeah they get in
And then we [?], oh yeah we down to business
Right behind the tinted, zoom, no witness

[Hook]

[Verse 2 – 2 Chainz]
Checker board Louis, nigga you fuey
Spit at your niggas like loogeys
Your girlfriend bited, she might start chewing
That little money ain’t nothing, I stack mine taller than [?]
And urine, the presence of the Benz, I’m fresh up out the Lex
She got tattoos on her booty and I just got me a check
I told her bend over, let me see what I can get
Shawty said she had that juicy and it wasn’t and outfit
Damn

[Hook]

[Verse 3 – M Beezy]
This ain’t tricking off, but I be spending on her
And her, let me see you in that thong
Jimmy by the hour then I hit it then I’m gone
Straight to voicemail, she can’t even reach my phone
Me and Tity tag team em, all I know is bad divas
You can see them bad divas when we pull up at a show
We don’t wait in line, we walk right up to the door
With a bag full of money, tell em bitches let’s go

[Hook]
