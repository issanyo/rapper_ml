[Intro: Labrinth, ???]
Opera singing
Majesty, Majesty, Majesty, oh oh

[Part 1: Good Form: Nicki Minaj]

[Intro]
Mhm, yo, hold up, hold up
Mhm, mhm, mhm, mhm, mhm

[Verse 1]
Yo, hold up, hold up, hold up, okay, hold up
You see a bad B coming through yo what's the hold up
I’m in that new new me and New New when I roll up
I told the valet, "Park my Benz and bring the Rolls up."
Yo, hold up, hold up, hold up, okay, hold up
He see me lookin' pretty every time he scroll up
Might gotta let the blicky hit you if you stroll up
Now put your hands up, it's a hold up
Run me the money (yeah)

[Refrain]
’Cause I be the baddie B, Barbie Tingz
Banging body B, everybody be on my D
Yo I gotta be in reality, suck a D if you doubted me
Back of the back, back of the back
Back of the back, back of the back
Who on Barbie D? Who on Barbie D? Everybody
Who you gotta see? Honestly, on my odyssey
I'm the baddest B, I don't even know how to speak
Hat to the hat to the back and relax, you in the back of the 'Bach

[Verse 2]
See a chick got more, than a game room
So we ain't ever hatin' in TheShadeRoom
See I keep my sons in-
So me and you ain't ever in the same room

[Chorus]
I tell him eat the cookie 'cause it’s good for him
And when he eat the cookie he got good form
He know I don’t ever cheat because I'm good to him
Might gotta have his baby, nurses yellin’ push for him
You see I let him eat the cookie 'cause it's good for him
And when he bite, he eat the cookie he got good form
He know that when I'm pullin’ up I'm in a good foreign
I be like ooh he love me, ooh he love me, good form
Come on, come on, come on
I be like ooh he love me, ooh he love me, good form (come on)

[Part 2: Woman Like Me: Little Mix & Nicki Minaj]

[Intro: Nicki Minaj, Little Mix]
It's the Queen and Little Mix
The Queen and Little Mix
Swish
Woman Like Me, like a woman like me

[Verse 1: Jesy Nelson and Leigh-Anne Pinnock]
I always say what I'm feeling
I was born without a zip on my mouth
Sometimes I don't even mean it
It takes a little while to figure me out
I like my coffee with two sugars in it
High heels and my jewellery dripping
Drink and I get all fired up (Hey, hey, hey)
Insecure but I'm working with it
Many things that I could get rid of
Ain't about to give it up

[Pre-Chorus: Jade Thirlwall, Perrie Edwards, (Jess Glynne)]
I made a few mistakes, I regret it nightly
I broke a couple hearts that I wear on my sleeve
My momma always said, "Girl, you're trouble" and
And now I wonder, could you fall for a woman like me
And every time we touch, boy, you make me feel weak
I can tell you're shy and I think you're so sweet
Spending every night under covers and
Still I wonder, could you fall for a woman like me
(A Woman)

[Chorus: Jade Thirlwall and (Jess Glynne)]
Woman like me, like a woman like me
La-la-la, woman like me, like a woman like me (A woman)
La-la-la, woman like me, like a woman like me
La-la-la, woman like me, like a woman like me

[Verse 2: Nicki Minaj]
Yo, woman like me, yes a woman like me (oh)
Soon as I brush up on him I could tell he like me (oh)
You know all them mandem, a try to swipe me (kyuh)
Knotted up, he could afford to ice me (Hh, rhrr)
Tell 'em there's a bad Trini —- inna your area (uh)
But the more bad chicks, then the more merrier (c'mon)
Baddies to my left and to the right a little scarier (uh)
Rude boy, tell me, can you handle all this derrière? (da derrière, rhrr)
Uh, a million I'm getting a billy on
Greatest of all time, 'cause I'm a chameleon
I switch it up for every era, I'm really bomb
These girls really wanna be Nicki, I'm really mom
Apple cut the cheque, I want all this money
Seven Up, go grip the TEC, and leave all this bloody
It's the Queen and Little Mix, skated on 'em, sorry
My daddy is Indian (Swish), a-all this curry (Mhm)


[Breakdown: Jade Thirlwall]

[Pre-Chorus: Jade Thirlwall, (Jade & Perrie,) Perrie Edwards]
(I made a few mistakes, I regret it nightly)
I broke a couple hearts that I wear on my sleeve
My momma always said, "Girl, you're trouble" and
And now I wonder, could you fall for a woman like me, yeah
And every time we touch, boy, you make me feel weak
I can tell you're shy and I think you're so sweet
Spending every night under covers and
Still I wonder, could you fall for a woman like me
Yes Nicki!
Let's go!
