[Hook: Tyga]
Snapbacks back, snapback back
That's all these niggas saying, I brought snapback back
I'm a fresh ass nigga, bitches know I'm the shit
25 for my belt, nigga get off my dick
Snapbacks back, snapback back
That's all these niggas saying, I brought snapback back
I'm a fresh ass nigga, bitches know I'm the shit
25 for my belt, nigga get off my dick

[Verse 1: Tyga]
I brought the snapback back, snapback back
Man all these niggas foul like hack-a-Shaq
Nigga racks on racks my bitch ass so fat
Yo bitch booty like a pancake, flat flapjack
I make your dollars collapse trail low in the strap
Shells big as a turtle master splinter to rap
Suspend you like Urkel your body hanging from fat
Thought you was sharper than tacks, get you thrown like some jacks
All these bitches with these tassels on their titties tryna tax
I don't give a fuck if none of y'all don't rap
I could pull a bitch just turning my back
Who knew that, venus trap
Flyest nigga in the class
Goyard bag, see that tag?
I could pay your rent all year boy
Yo mama know, your cousin, sister brother and your mama know
Your cousin, sister brother and your mama know
Your cousin, sister brother and your mama know
Bitch, your granny know nigga

[Hook: Tyga]
Snapbacks back, snapback back
That's all these niggas saying, I brought snapback back
I'm a fresh ass nigga, bitches know I'm the shit
25 for my belt, nigga get off my dick
Snapbacks back, snapback back
That's all these niggas saying, I brought snapback back
I'm a fresh ass nigga, bitches know I'm the shit
25 for my belt, nigga get off my dick

[Verse 2: Chris Brown]
Leggo, snapback bac,k put V.A. on the map
I'm a young nigga, heartthrob, girls cardiac
I got your girls all on my dick, yeah them chickens giving me neck, nigga
You ain't talkin' 'bout shit, fuck your city, press eject
Too busy coughing up them hairballs
Fur coat, bear dog
Spray these niggas like aerosol
And fuck them old niggas, Geritol
Hold up, snapback on
Champagne MCM backpack on
Lucky that my situation in this probation
Won't even let me strap that tome
My condo ain't no hotter, I be right at home
What you mean nigga I'm coherant
Steez out with my D out and you wonder
Why your shorty be disappearing
Haha, I brought the snapback back
Last Kings and them Ti$as, yeah they sell like crack
You got no car insurance, no Ray Bans
This Geico, caveman
First of the month you do a praise dance
Like I'm moving on up, aye man
Stop that, drop a hat in the club
They gon' be like that nigga on drugs
Get more respect in L.A. than you do
But your welcome for the pub

[Hook: Tyga]
Snapbacks back, snapback back
That's all these niggas saying, I brought snapback back
I'm a fresh ass nigga, bitches know I'm the shit
25 for my belt, nigga get off my dick
Snapbacks back, snapback back
That's all these niggas saying, I brought snapback back
I'm a fresh ass nigga, bitches know I'm the shit
25 for my belt, nigga get off my dick
