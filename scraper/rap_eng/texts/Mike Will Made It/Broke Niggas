[Intro: Gucci Mane & Young Thug]
Go, go, Wop, huh
He back, hoo!
Family, yeah, ya digg
Ya digg?
Ayy man I stay down with him like it's motherfucking [?] you know what I’m sayin

[Chorus: Gucci Mane]
Started in the trap, now I'm a plug nigga
Lil bitch you know you dealin' with a drug dealer
All this gold on me, I’m looking for a gold digger
It ain't here fault, I guess she used to fuck with broke niggas

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
This lil bitch dancing on the table, where her table manners?
Haters watching my Snapchat like it's they favorite channel
Had to put my cape on and my wings, fly in, and save Atlanta
I'm in a ragin' cajin', seats Caucasian, amazing Phantom
I was a corner boy, I turned into a drug lord
I tell her go bitch, I tell her go bitch
I need a nigga like a need another gun charge
I tell her go bitch, I tell her go bitch
I wear four watches on one arm, I'm tryna punish these bitches
Any problems that I had man I confronted the snitches
Soon as they let me out the Feds I tried to run to the dentist
And now I'm smiling with the money in the front of the Bentley

[Chorus: Gucci Mane]
Started in the trap, now I’m a plug nigga
Lil bitch you know you dealin’ with a drug dealer
All this gold on me, I'm looking for a gold digger
It ain’t here fault, I guess she used to fuck with broke niggas

[Verse 2: Young Thug]
Fuck with these poor niggas
You fuck with these broke niggas
[?] nigga
I was just serving that soap to niggas
I ran up my rackades
You bleeding, no band-aid
I'm dripped in my white but no mayonnaise
Red rag on my head match the  [?]
She dripping my sauce
I got a new whip and it cost
That fire come out the exhaust
I just throw 10 racks at the bar
I just could've bought a new [?]
But instead I just got high as a star
I just could've chopped off a roof
I just poured a 8 in some juice
I hopped in a Rolls and I tore up the streets
I got a new Jeep and I tore out the seats
I tear out the guts just to ride up the street
I tear off the shoes and I put on some feet
I turn up my baby and now she unique
She cool as a fan, got her off of the street
Today I feel just like [?]
Today I just might [?]

[Chorus: Gucci Mane & Young Thug]
Started in the trap, now I’m a plug nigga
Started, started in the trap, now I'm a plug, hey
Lil bitch you know you dealin' with a drug dealer
I said little bitch you know you dealin' with a drug dealer, yeah
All this gold on me, I'm looking for a gold digger
I said all this gold on me, I'm looking for a gold digger
It ain't here fault, I guess she used to fuck with broke niggas
