Sunrey:
Hasbro the way im toyin with em
Flows is what a young boy switchin
If you need the proof, the pudding’s standing right in front of you
Babe ruth with the hits, every day i’m writing one or two

All about that paper, can’t miss a beat
I don’t think that chase would, disagree
If we talking slappers, i’m the king of that
I sing and rap, if we talking stacks

Chase:
I’ll bring it back, if i see ya cap, ima peel it back
Hit his ass like i'm trimmin grass off a chia pet
We to rap, like what metal gear was to sneak attacks (!)
You gon have get up out that box if you gon see success

Hit her with this solid snake and she gon be your ex
And if you think she cut you deep, you should see my back
Hate to beat a dead horse, but i got her in bed more
Than rick in episode 1, comatose with bed sores

Sunrey:
My new attitude cavalier, it’s on quicken loans
I hit every single one of my fucks with eviction notes
Bitter neighbors bitching cause i blast my shit fortissimo
Tryna get my beak up in the bread like chicken tikka rolls (masala)

When i’m on stage, issa sacrament
Born A Rap Savior, peep them letters, issa acronym
Ooh, bring it back if you ain’t catch that shit
Always hostile to these rappers like they backpacking

Chase:
Bring it back, and release the kraken, i'm a beast, you maggot
Reach the magazine, and sear his ass until he hears the masses
U kiss the barrel, get a big bang, y’all can keep the scrappin'
Know when this' K pop, i leave a G draggin'

Red velvet highlights, had to wet 'em up
If she bad i hit it twice, inside her bentley truck
I don't miss a false flagger, when i gun 'em down
Run mothafucka, run, better run, now

Sunrey:
Sun, burn you like a bunsen, you done, blaow
You sound dumbed down, well i’m done, tell you bums, ciao
Coming at your jug, make you gulp, spit your gum out
Two of us buzzing, this just sesh one, like kung pao (yummy!)

Wrote this shit in calcutta, whole crew on the same side, last supper
Those who, tryna take mine shall suffer, i capture the whole movement, like fast shutters, yeah
Ya novia over she get the churro hard, duro
Secret rapper sun leave you in the dark, chiaroscuro

[BEAT SWITCH]

[Verse 2: Chase and Sunrey]

Okay, bring it back, get it back to rap, i got sick of that
Me and walker link up on a track, homie issa wrap
From 44 to the three and a third
We fucking up the game, giving y’all the bees and the birds

You see how we murder, mc’s with just the ease of these words
We takin up the first and second, but you easily third
Don’t take it personal, name a rapper hot as me that you heard
Man, most of y’all still going backwards turning cheese into curd, listen

I guide the squad to the top like a sherpa, ooh
I said take off that bra gimme top like a shirt bruh
I’m finna cop a cavali fur for my mom
Your mcm just chomped down on a tide pod

We transatlantic, tryna cross us there’s a chance you vanish
Crew behind us yeah we troop heavy like afghanistan is
Man the cannons, cameras can’t capture the catalysmic
Catastrophes we exhibit when tellin rappers to can it

Rap my shit and they abandon they ship, like crackin the whip
No juugin’ nor finessin’, they just hand me they shit
Saturday latter day saint, got all your baes in my whip
Happily they get passed down like the family biz

Rappers throw tantrums and diss, i can’t be mad at my kids
Don’t worry i ain’t finna hurt em just a slap on the wrist
But, see this smack go cracking down through your skin and ligaments
Nigga, this shit’ll burn like sunrays on solstices

The most gifted, the hoes don’t get this whole dick
I juxtapose ‘em, just to pose ‘em, just to post a pic
I'm just supposed to boast and coast on every beat we chose to rip
MCs get barbecued, spit roasted, over an open pit

Bitch
