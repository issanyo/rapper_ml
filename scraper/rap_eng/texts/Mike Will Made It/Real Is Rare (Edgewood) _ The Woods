Eardrummers
Swear to God
Nigga just get the bag, don't give no fuck 'bout nothin' else, get the bag anyway fuck 'em

[Chorus]
Fuck niggas I can't fuck wit 'em
Fuck niggas I can't fuck wit 'em
Real is rare so I rarely fuck wit niggas
Real is rare so I rarely fuck wit niggas
Fuck niggas gotta duck niggas
Fuck nigga you's a fuck nigga
Real is rare so I rarely fuck wit niggas
Real is rare so I rarely fuck wit niggas

[Verse 1]
What's this, A-plus nigga (what's this)
You fuckin' wit a A-plus nigga (woo)
Try to tell my young'n stiffen up he trust niggas (whoa)
Been burned by that bullet, I know not to trust niggas (I been burned by that bullet)
Put faith in a bitch, she went and fucked a fuck nigga (lame ass hoe)
Same fuck nigga I would slide and duck wit her (ridin' round wit a broke boi)
Jokes on a broke ho, her folks want forgiveness (tuh)
Went and got a ticket bitch soon as I got out the prison (aye)
Fuck wrong wit ya huh, you not makin' noise
Let ya get a taste of this pure, streets got spoiled
Hit a nigga off wit a forty, you playin' hard
When I say you hit a nigga off wit a forty, he ain't Paul George
Lights out, I'm the one ceasin' the crowd noise
Ain't a damn thing happened to Skoob, it's murder one
That's a homicide, let's get the bag, no no more drums
I say get a drum, fuck a fuck nigga guess what gon' come huh

[Bridge]
Big Troub, Bi-Bi-Big Troub
Real is rare that why I rarely fuck wit niggas (swear)
Real is rare that why I rarely fuck wit niggas (swear)
Keep it in real quick, Big Troub
Real is rare that's why you cannot fuck wit niggas (huh huh)
Real is rare that's why you cannot fuck wit niggas (huh huh)

[Verse 2]
Now that I'm done thinkin', I can get this paper
Goddammit still drinkin', still say yes to capers
They say I'ma bad influence, told you that few years ago (I told you)
Prolly had ya main hoe bustin' on her tip toes (what)
Nigga screamin' thug life (thug life), I ain't ever seen them
I be where it's swole at, only hope is dope or rap
Dice game, four-four and rap, dice game, four-four or trap
Dice game, four-four and rap, dice game, four-four or trap
Dice game'll blow ya cap backwards, you playin' games (games) Draco shoot through bricks bitch, I done watch the change frame (frame)
One time for the Westside, yo kinfolk yo patna them (my patna) One time for the Eastside, you good then you my bruddas them (my brudda)
That, that's it, feel upset, murder by the kid
That, that, doin' all that, I'm just poppin' shit
That, that's it, feel upset, bustin' by the kid
Yeah yeah

[Chorus]
Fuck niggas I can't fuck wit em
Fuck niggas I can't fuck wit em
Real is rare so I rarely fuck wit niggas
Real is rare so I rarely fuck wit niggas
Fuck niggas gotta duck niggas
Fuck nigga you's a fuck nigga
Real is rare so I rarely fuck wit niggas
Real is rare so I rarely fuck wit niggas
