[Hook]
Pour it up, Pour it up, Pour it up
Fill it up
Baby girl girl give it up
Niggas can't handle us
Bitches can't handle us
We live like Toy's-R-Us
I'mma pull up and I'm not from New York
But I'm living notorious
Hey, hope I don't get you beat up by barbarius
You better walk little boy there ain't no scaring us
I'm living life like an angel while smoking on angel dust
We stuntin' ain't no playin' us
Drop top, make it rain on us (don't try it, don't try it)
I'm fuckin' her and ain't nut
And she don't wanna bang with us (woo, woo)
(Ha,ha,ha,ha,ha,ha,ha,ha!)

[Verse]
I'mma fly down on that bitch like a bald eagle
Baby don't say shit to me in public because you are a cheater
Even when I'm in the library studying, I'm smoking loud reefer
It ain't nothing but I caught 3 fever (gas, gas, gas)
That's that gas mufucka, that's that gas mufucka (swish, skrrrt)
Pull off in  drive a brand new loft on em'
Whole 7 and a blunt make em cough on em
Real ice just like a life, Make her mouth on it
When I say keep that then that's sauce homie
I'mma win I hope you can take a loss homie
I'mma pull up like a martian on 4 homie
Take em way out the street, take em way out the street, ayyy
We ride 5 in a car you know you can't be beat, ayyy
Ain't no mouse, but I'm chasing cheese, ayyy
I'mma walk into McDonalds get a cup of ice and something to eat
Right before I
