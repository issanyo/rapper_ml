[Intro]
(Ayy) Ear Drummers
Y'all niggas always talking 'bout you want a bad bitch
But you can't handle no bad bitch (Sound like Santa on the roof)
'Cause bad bitches comes with bad habits
I want a new fit and some Gucci shoes
And I want my hair done and my nails, too
So what you gon' do?

[Chorus]
Your bad ass ain't gettin' nothin' for Christmas
Your bad ass ain't gettin' nothin' for Christmas
Your bad ass ain't gettin' nothin' for Christmas
Your bad ass ain't gettin' nothin' for Christmas
Your bad ass ain't gettin' nothin' for Christmas
(Freaky girl, freaky girl)
Your bad ass ain't gettin' nothin' for Christmas
(Hey, freaky girl, freaky girl)
Girl, show me your wishlist (Hey, bad girl)
I can't read your wishlist (Yeah, bad girl)
Your bad ass ain't gettin' nothin' for Christmas (Ayy, bad girl)
(Yeah, bad girl)

[Interlude]
Ho ho ho, Merry Christmas to everybody
Merry Christmas

[Verse]
Let me contradict myself
I just bought my baby Chanel (Hold up)
Even though she like to act up (What?)
I took her to get the D-cups (Hey)
Baby say she wants a new butt (New butt)
'Nother spring comin' up (Comin' up)
Benihana's for lunch (For lunch)
She don't want no scrubs
You know we love them good girls, good girls
We love them good girls, good girls
We love them bad girls (Ayy)

[Pre-Chorus]
So you say you want a bad bitch, huh?

[Chorus]
Your bad ass ain't gettin' nothin' for Christmas
Your bad ass ain't gettin' nothin' for Christmas
Your bad ass ain't gettin' nothin' for Christmas
Your bad ass ain't gettin' nothin' for Christmas
Your bad ass ain't gettin' nothin' for Christmas
(Freaky girl, freaky girl)
Your bad ass ain't gettin' nothin' for Christmas
(Hey, freaky girl, freaky girl)
Girl, show me your wishlist (Hey, bad girl)
I can't read your wishlist (Yeah, bad girl)
Your bad ass ain't gettin' nothin' for Christmas (Ayy, bad girl)
(Yeah, bad girl)

[Outro]
Your bad ass make a nigga wanna spend it fast
Santa ain't the only one with a bag
Your bad ass make a nigga wanna spend it fast
(Freaky girl, freaky girl)
Santa ain't the only one with a bag
(Hey, freaky girl, hey, freaky girl)
(Hey, bad girl, yeah, bad girl)
(Hey, bad girl, yeah, bad girl)
