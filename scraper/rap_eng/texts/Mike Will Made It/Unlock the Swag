[Verse 1: Slim Jimmy]
I blow, I lie, I chill, I sway
How much, cash do, I make, a day?
Enough, to brag, enough, for tags
6 bands, I drop, Celine, big bags
My pants, they bustin'
My bitch, she bluffin', keep lyin', for nothing
I win, I'm winnin', I walk, in Fendi
My head, still spinnin', from last, night's women
Who got, more guap? No flex, boy stop
Push off, the lot, with all, you got
My leather, is soft, my top, it's off
Can't speak, too boss, I drop, the sauce

[Verse 2: Jace]
Swa-Swag unlocked like I picked it
Twistin' fingers, gang signs, no pinky
P.A.C, how a youngin' gon' kick it
Sauced up shawty, in here drippin'
Got your shawty in here strippin'
Off 'shrooms and molly and some weed I got from dealers
'Bout to have a party so you better pay attention
So much Stussy on my body I’m like one of Shawn’s children
I said I'm in, here high, the fuck, you think?
I said it's purple, inside, of all, my drinks
I said, "Good God, the label, all my blunts, they stink like piu
Man I wouldn't want to be you, I'm in London like a Beatle
Countin' Euros with my people, rollin' up, blowin' diesel
Been switchin' up my cash, my nigga
Been had paper, my bag, my nigga
Been had loud blunts on blast, my nigga
You know what's up, don't ask, my nigga
I am perfect at pickin' a piece, workin' and rippin' a beat
Crew worth a milli at least, money when dealin' with me
Your girl is leavin' with me, it's honestly easy to see
Swag unlocked and you know that I give her the key

[Verse 3: Swae Lee]
I curve, your doobie, then blaze, my own
Let's get it, some Givenchy, droppin' racks, I'm clumsy
I'm drenched, in money, she hate me, she love me
I'm rich, I'm young, I splurge, for fun
Care less, about your... campaign
Enjoy, myself, employ, myself
Woke up, last night, was all, a blur
4 Seasons, 3 words, do not, disturb
