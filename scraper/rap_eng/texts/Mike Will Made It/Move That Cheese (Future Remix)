“The poets have been mysteriously silent on the subject of cheese.” - G.K. Chesterton

[Hook]
Big Teacha move that cheese
Big Teacha move that cheese
Move that cheese, move that cheese (8x)

[Verse 1]
Stacking cheddar cause I’m betta
Than Ezra poundin dough for mo'rella
Twice as good as Gudda Gudda
Call that murder for Gouda
Cuba Gooding Junior: show me the money (show me the money)
Like mice 2 da cheese, I’m trapping for money
Bass bumping da whip, I'll surround ya like Dolby
So up ya bricks, bruh, or get shredded like Colby
Jack the Rapper, grab chance by the throat:
“Make ya next level cheesin, call me the GOAT"
I go fiend on my foes, fighting for muenster
Keep even Em on his toes, cause I’m friends with his Monster
Get Ri on da hook, cause I’m looking to conquer
Get brie on da cook, taste be buddin for slaughter
Tyler created, just to call dat kid yonkers
German green grated: my limburger’s longer
