[Verse 1]
So this how it gon' be
Tried pressing charges cause your credibility deceased
You took a huge hit and you couldn’t accept this defeat
Needed your ass humbled so we put you in a hot seat
Sit down, before you get your ass beat
You be flexin' on the gram to feed insecurities
Overshadowed by your brother, got the short end of the genes
Explains why the fit is breaking at the seams
You wack like a 4th string quarterback
That likes to talk smack
Claimin' you’re all that, thinkin' you’re on track
But you ain’t got no game, man your claims so insane
You hit this, you hit that, but your girl denying the claims
Did I say your girl I meant your ex
The one you thought you’d use latex
You ain’t give that girl no rest
Sending all those disturbing texts
Oh yeah I heard you masturbate
To Fortnite … wait
Did I hear that right, no way
You did it 3 times a day

[Hook]
Miss me with that weak shit
You only pullin' hoes with that small dick
You be only pullin' ugly bitches
A nigga fell in love and he can’t face it (can’t face it)
You claimin' these are rumors but we the witness (the witness)
I guess gettin' curved is a fitness (a fitness)
You ain’t hittin shit x3
You ain’t hittin-

[*Scratches*]

[Verse 2]
So you asked to be friends with benefits
After girl broke up with you and never let you hit
Messed with girl’s hearts for a quick fix
But you know your fakin' ass ain’t on some pimp shit

You’re just a horny ass, lonely ass
Lookin' for girls cause you can’t get passed
The fact that your ass got thrown in the trash
And now you stuck livin' in the pass

You lost your chance at romance
And all your dreams of slow dance
So now you try to get in hoes pants
To get your clout enhanced

How you gon' claim “pull-god status”
When your love life is tragic
Where is the magic
You’re dreamin' if you think you had it
So keep tellin' all them lies
You’re in for a surprise
Wanna clapback don’t try
You could never beat these rhymes
You can’t block this
The whole world is gonna see your bullshit
The whole world is gonna see through all that bliss
Now who’s the culprit
Your that nigga with a crooked dick

[*Scratches*]

[Verse 3]
I’m tired of sippin' tea, I got to play my part
Sending shots through the dark to hit your heart
This ain’t somethin' that I did start
But this is somethin' Imma finish
That’s something you never did in Women
Your whole life is a gimmick, I’ve reached my limit
Can’t amend it, you’re pathetic
You’re a menace, that’s living off his mom’s dependence
You really claim you’re a fitness model
You think girls should feel like they hit the lotto
You look like your parents still give you bottles
Your whole defense mechanism is ostinato
Always have to bring your ex into this
Always gotta talk about how you so fit
But deep inside you just a scared Lil' bitch
Deep inside you know that you ain’t shit
11/10 can’t ever hang
You’ve done so much to taint these names
You flex so much you’re just a strain
It’s time we all cut you out the frame
Get exposed with the murder I wrote
All the sleepers are woke
I got all the quotes
I’m clearing the smoke
Take this shit like a man instead of getting others involved
You can’t hold your own like a kid with mods
Thinking you’re untouchable you ain’t no god
You hide your true feelings with this weak facade
You only pullin' ugly bitches
You fell in love and you can’t face it
You claimin' these are rumors but we the witness
Getting curved is your fitness

[*Scratches*]

[Verse 4]
Real quick let’s go, last verse

Got me breathing with dragons
I'll crack the egg in your basket, you bastard
I'm Marilyn Manson with madness
Now just imagine the magic I light to asses
Don't ask for the most hated flexer
(He dead!) Yes Sir
(Amen!) Mosque
(He dead!) I killed him
(Amen!) Bitch

You thought that I was finished
I got your ass for another minute
Perk your ears up and listen
Here’s what people do for things that glisten
Let’s see if you can step to this better than you did when you auditioned for international night
Got rejected wait that’s normal for you every time you try to smash a girl, right?
We were the realest friends you ever had
What happens when it all will crash
Those friends will leave you trashed
Even when you drop the bag
They talk behind your back like you to us
Your camp is under attack even the ones you trust
It’s the ones that are closest
That disappear like hocus pocus
They never gave you this notice
Now this fire is so potent wow
How you think I found all this out anyway?
Be careful about what you say
That shit runs in your DNA
You’re just a snake lookin for prey
This is just a PSA
To let you know you’re in a disturbing place
It doesn’t matter now about what you say
Cause this nigga just went and cracked the case
Cracked the case like you did your dick
Cause you beat your dick with a clenching fist
