[Intro]
I’m lookin’ for him
I’m lookin’ for him
I’m lookin’ for him
I’m lookin’ for him

[Verse 1]
Is that him in the VIP-line
Chucks on, [?]
Said he flew from tampa, ride a skateboard
I don’t want him, his friends are stoners
And I heard that sell was a loaner
His homie was an owner
I don't even drink the most [?]
Make sure you use a [?]
It's fallout forever
Think dirty sprite is better
You said roll it with me
I said these boys will work together
If you wanna live better
We can turn up lover
Don’t get too thirsty, get used to it's cheddar
I wanna tell the world about you, you're the cutest boy ever
And if you see ‘er ‘fore I do tell ‘er I wish that I’ve met ‘er

[Hook]
Turn on the lights
I’m lookin’ for ‘er too
I heard he take it's time, and need to see if this is true
I heard that he been dreaming, we gon' see what we can do
I heard he be there anytime you need ‘im, he come through
Turn on the lights
I’m lookin’ for him
I’m lookin’ for him
Turn on the lights
I’m lookin’ for him
I’m lookin’ for him
I’m lookin’ for him
I’m lookin’ for him

[Verse 2]
Send him my way
Tell him I’ve been lookin’ for him in the broad day
Hangin’ with the drink kids out in silverlake
Better know, to keep me boy you gotta get that cake
Turn on the lights
I’m lookin’ for him too
I heard he got a hair like [?]
And hair like [?]
You kiss me in the parking lot, you kiss me in the sand
He flyer than a plane, so i just tell em where to land
We gonna do it my way, boy you need to understand
When we get together we gon' make it hit the charts
I call up boy because i [?] making art

[Hook]
Turn on the lights
I’m lookin’ for ‘er too
I heard he take it's time, and need to see if this is true
I heard that he been dreaming, we gon' see what we can do
I heard he be there anytime you need ‘im, he come through
Turn on the lights
I’m lookin’ for him
I’m lookin’ for him
Turn on the lights
I’m lookin’ for him
I’m lookin’ for him

He's a rude boy
But he's a good boy here
