Just a small town girl
Livin' in a lonely world
She took the midnight train goin' anywhere
Just a city boy
Born and raised in south Detroit
He took the midnight train goin' anywhere

A singer in a smoky room
A smell of wine and cheap perfume
For a smile they can share the night
It goes on and on, and on, and on

[Chorus]
Strangers waitin'
Up and down the boulevard
Their shadows searching in the night
Streetlights, people
Livin' just to find emotion
Hidin' somewhere in the night


Workin' hard to get my fill
Everybody wants a thrill
Payin' anythin' to roll the dice
Just one more time
Some will win, some will lose
Some were born to sing the blues
Oh, the movie never ends
It goes on and on, and on, and on

Strangers waitin'
Up and down the boulevard
Their shadows searchin' in the night
Streetlights, people
Livin' just to find emotion
Hidin' somewhere in the night

[Chorus]
Don't Stop Believin'
Hold on to the feelin'
Streetlight, people
Ohh-Ohhh-Ohhhhhhhh

Don't Stop Believin'
Hold on to the feelin'
Streetlight, people
Ohh-Ohhh-Ohhhhhhhh

Don't stop believin'
Hold on
Streetlight, people
Ohh-Ohhh-Ohhhhhhhh

Don't stop believin' (Fading)
Hold on...????
Streetlight, people
Ohh-Ohhh-Ohhhhhhhh

Don't Stop..(Fading)
