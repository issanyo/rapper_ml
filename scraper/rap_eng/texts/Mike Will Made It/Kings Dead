Miss me with that bologna raise a brow on Jabroni
Take my crown off and hangout the King fled
[one night only]
That ornament come with soldiers
And castles and gun suppressors
That's aimed at your neck
They want the King dead
If you take my place just know that karma
Coming with Kama sutra and hellfire TVs
That only show commercials
Don't take it personal that's how the cookie dismantle
Take a shot at the top and you
Shoulder what you can't handle
I've been standing my ground
Heel and toe to the floor
Gotta steady stroll on the prowl
Am i human or totodile, mellow or sorta loud
Flagrant or kinda passive if so I'll throw in a towel
When your opinions allowed in
FYI it's most likely never don't use your breath to vent
Telling me what I could've should've would've been better if
The betterment of me is to settle with Trends and lesser than
The better side of me is not olive branching to messy friends
Cutting damaged ends if the resolution ain't make a mends
A bitter end is sweet if you dead the beef with shaken hands
One on one's irrelevant niggas is shooting from the stands
Reputations everything shoot him or do the running man
Victim did the Donovan couldn't escape the flame in hand
Eagle landed shells in his pelvis he'll never walk again
Damn his family ready for war they loading AR's and more
5-0 ain't helping for sure hit the floor floor

Miss me with them problems my parents kept me out of
You cherish nada my bare essentials will tear your heart out
I'm King Joffer you Randy Watson
You'll never top me like pizza toppings
So meet defeat and sleep in the parking lot
Better than having your body chalked
Or Coroner's picking you up in pieces
And family wearing you on a t-shirt
Attacking your home back for the throne
Back for the crown on your Dome
Back to you peasants stab if you want

Miss me with that bologna raise a brow on Jabroni
Take my crown off and hangout the King fled
[For one more night]
That ornament come with soldiers
And castles and gun suppressors
That's aimed at your neck
They want the King dead
