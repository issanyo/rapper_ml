[Verse 1]
Chapter one; we started happy
The second that you said you loved me
Started questioning us
Are we really in love?
Tryna figure out chapter three
But you're not giving me anything
If this is what we are, then I gotta move on
You think this is everything, but this is no book of love

[Chorus]
You might think I'm crazy
That I'm lost and foolish leaving you behind
Maybe you're right
You might think I'm crazy
That I'm lost and foolish leaving you behind
Maybe you're right
Maybe you're right

[Verse 2]
Here comes the part of you and me
Arguing about nothing
You tell me it's as good as it gets
Yeah, I'm real emotional
Blame it on your mental jokes
How much did you think that I could take?
So much for taking this too far
You can't blame me for who I am
It's too late for us to try to be in love right now

[Chorus]
You might think I'm crazy
That I'm lost and foolish leaving you behind
Maybe you're right
You might think I'm crazy
That I'm lost and foolish leaving you behind
Maybe you're right
Maybe you're right

[Bridge]
Fill the pages now, this chapter's done
Moving on up and forward onto all that will become
If you ever get to the place where the sun is shining every day
Then I'll be on your mind

[Chorus]
You might think I'm crazy (Crazy, yeah)
That I'm lost and foolish leaving you behind
Maybe you're right
You might think I'm crazy
That I'm lost and foolish leaving you behind
Maybe you're right
Maybe you're right
