[Verse 1: Malcolm Elliott]

Sleep

Yea, Check me out look

Look they created a monster
It's the mac
And I'm back
On Attack

You a fiend
And these raps
Be the crack
Don't blink

Cause you thought
It was water up in the sink
Can't drink Flow is ice
And the beat is the rink

Betta skate Getting hot
So you Betta ventilate
Yo mistake I'm awake
Who the best I'm a wait

You a snake
But you looking
Like a steak
On my plate

Rap game
This cake
Fast lane
Never break

Light it then put it in roto
It hit like it's Cotto
They see me like
"Oh no" You know

That I snap like photo
You know that I'm cold though
Heard you in love
With the CoCo

Round here
They be walking
Wit Bricks like they Toto
Boy I'm a dragon, Komodo

Tcdub all on my logo
She saw it then
Tried to hop all on
My pogo in slow mo'

You know how that go though

Look

We bouta get down
To that nitty gritty
Coming from the city
Where yo chances of making it

Itty bitty it's a pity really
Yea I'm 20
But i want that pretty penny
Talking 100's and 50's

Something like Sean
He came outta Cass
I came out of Renni
This outta respect

I'm tryna ball
Cause we want it all
So You can't get any

If Sean hit the booth and
He went super Saiyan
I would say I'm cooler
Than Frieza but
Better yet Super Gogeta

I'm hot like a heater
Boy yea I'm hot like fever
I pull out a VISA
Make something shake like a seizure

Lyrical reaper
You gotta turn up yo speaker
A creature that's spitting this either
Fame and the glory
Well I don't want either

Do this for the love
Do it for the rush
But it's not enough
Cause a lot a lust
Burn a lot of trust

Re-adjust

Never give it up
When it's Getting tough
You can Trust
Man when I bust
Ima live it up

Paradise

Man they push and shove
For the light
Take flight like a dove
Sleep tight
Me and raps fit nice
Like a glove

Flow like the sea
So I just gave her D
For all of D above like


Malcolm I heard
You the man
Blow me
I heard you a fan

Rappers are butter pecan
Man we just hop in the van
Run up and dot you
Like you was Japan

Snapping man
What is you saying
Now they be checking me out
Like they gotta scan

Over before It began
Way before
Before Breezy and Tyga
Both messed with a Tran

Bet you it hit like
Muhammad Ali
I'm the best
So who else do you
Want me to be

Am I rapping like him
Or he rapping like me
Well I want you to know
I'm not rapping for free

It's a wrap for these rappers
They actors to me
Don't come correct
I'll be taxing the fee

Man either way I'll be
Counting the cheese
Let 'em keep Sleeping
They counting the Z's

But this is what Paradise
Sound like to me

[Elixir Hipster]

I don't know why
This feels so good
Come on you know
This feels so good
I don't know what it is
But this feels good
Come on you know
This feels so good
