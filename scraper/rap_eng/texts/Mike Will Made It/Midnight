[Verse 1: Tessa Thompson]
Closer and closer until we fall (We fall)
The space that we keep is just default (Default)
But I know it won't be long
'Til we touch the sun, it's gone
Bonded, I need a feeling
Bonded, I need it

[Chorus: Tessa Thompson]
Closer and closer until we fall back
I want it, I need it, you see it, you know that (Keepin' me calm now)
I just lost all control (Keepin' me calm now)
I just lost all control (Keepin' me calm now)
I just lost all control (Keepin' me calm now)
I just lost all control

[Verse 2: Gunna]
Midnight, met her at her room at midnight
Midnight, met her at her room at midnight
Comin' from the inside, I really wanna spend time
I put her on the next flight, I let her live her best life (Best life)
You can do what you want to
Do whatever you want to
I know the choices you gon' choose
Once we join forces, we won't lose
Roll like a coaster, don't stop, ooh
She walked out your life with some nice shoes
Paid off Rolls Royce and some iced jewels
I might talk, but I know you are goin' on your own
No mysteries on my own, you deserve you a home
And I earned me a crown, from the curb we done grown

[Chorus: Tessa Thompson]
I want it, I need it, you see it, you know
That's when I start to lose control
Takin' off my clothes, don't you let me go
Don't you let me-
That's when I start to lose control
(I just lost all control)
Takin' off my clothes
Don't you let me go
Don't you let me
(I just lost all control)
Closer and closer until we fall back
I want it, I need it
You see it, you know that
