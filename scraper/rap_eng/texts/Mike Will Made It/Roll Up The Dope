Roll up the dope, roll up the dope

[Verse 1:]
I'm like roll up the dope, where the bitches at
Designer everything, and it's mix match
MUBU gang, fuck and give your bitch back
MUBU gang bang, yeah, we with that
I'm like roll up the dope, pour another 4
If you ain't getting money what you living for?
If you ain't try to go, bitch, what you get in for?
It's crazy where I'm from, it get critical

[Verse 2:]
I'm like roll up the dope, I be off the shits
My bitches with the shits, baby, give a kiss
We rolling, yeah we rolling, you can call us cars
Right now I'm on my way to a m√©nage
My hoes, they do drugs and I do 'em with 'em
If niggas ain't gettin' money I ain't screwing with them
If he ain't with the shits, what you doing with 'em?
I'm smoking heavy dope, I need another smoke
It's like I can't go broke, cause everyday I'm broke
It's not a water fight, but that AK, it soak
MUBU checking bands we get a lot of cash
Money throwing party, it's a dollar bash
Can take some fucking days off, I get a lot of ass
Along with a lot of bandz, and smoke a lot of gas
