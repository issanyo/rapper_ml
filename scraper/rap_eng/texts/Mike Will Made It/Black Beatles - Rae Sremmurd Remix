Intro
Black beatle up and comin im destine for the moneys
I sent you flowers but you said you didn't recieve them but you said you didn't need them
Chorus
That girl is a  real crowd pleaser small world all her friends know of me
Young bull livin like an old geezer, release the cash watch it fall slowly
Frat girl still tryin to get even haters mad for whatever reason
Smoke in the air binge drinkin, they lose it when the dJ drop the needle
Verse 1
What in the hell was i thinkin, mixin up the blowin with the drinkin
Well have lessons to the grave, and still theres money to be made
Won't stop til i pull up at my momma crib, when you love your family then you honor them(1 for the team)
Rockstar (3x) bobby johnson shit
Father to a new age, oh i think im bobby johnson bitch
You can throw shade but you won't turn the lights out
And we gone keep shinin cuz we like a lighthouse
And you can throw shade but we, we too bright now
And we will not pipe down, no fuck next, we right now
Got a plan to balance out like a checkbook
Left a star all alone like westbrook
You the type to fold like a netbook
She wanna see wanna feel how my chest look
I can see she lookin for the truth up in her eyes baby hold on to the truth while you prowlin through the times
Chorus
That girl is a  real crowd pleaser small world all her friends know of me
Young bull livin like an old geezer, release the cash watch it fall slowly
Frat girl still tryin to get even haters mad for whatever reason
Smoke in the air binge drinkin, they lose it when the dJ drop the needle
Verse 2
Sharp as a needle thats for the record baby
Baby and hold it down any direction baby
We goin up thats what you tell em baby (2X)
She claim she love me i tell her stall it
Know one was there for me til i was ballin
Said look at all the great things it did for me
Momma ain't raise no sucker but still they lick on me
They claim they love me, now im important
But im too busy with my family and recordin
Black beatle, im a rock don cheadle
Im instructin my people right through the pineal, slidin wheel
She want legendary, everything extrodinary
Heart as cold as february, and you know she never worried
All that shit is secondary to whats comin necessary
Go until her vision blurry, warrior team we give em curry
Baby we can go anywhere you wanna go
Put me in your circle, if you on a roll, and she know to bowl
Both of us fanatics im mean look at our habits
She like trina im the baddest and im like yup no talkin but we made magic
Chorus
That girl is a  real crowd pleaser small world all her friends know of me
Young bull livin like an old geezer, release the cash watch it fall slowly
Frat girl still tryin to get even haters mad for whatever reason
Smoke in the air binge drinkin, they lose it when the dJ drop the needle

Hands in the air (repeats)
