[Verse 1]
Sweat dripping down your chest
Thinking 'bout your tattooed knuckles on my thigh, boy
Cold shower
You got no power to control how I make you my toy
My hips rocking, as we keep lip locking
Got the neighbors screaming even louder, louder
Lick me down, like you were rolling rizla
I'm smoking, come and put me out

[Chorus]
I'm your dream girl
This is real love
But you know what they say about me
That girl is a problem
Girl is a problem
Girl is a problem, problem
Ooh baby, you so bad, boy
Drive me mad, boy
But you don’t care what they say about me
That girl is a problem
Girl is a problem
Girl is a problem, problem

[Verse 2]
I got your name hanging from my chain
Don't you wanna claim my body like a vandal?
You got the cure underneath your shirt
Don't you wanna save this dirty little damsel?
Got my mink coat falling on the motel floor
You're on the bed wolf whistling louder, louder
Your lips smudging all my makeup
Kicking both my heels off
Come and pin me down

[Chorus]
I'm your dream girl
This is real love
But you know what they say about me
That girl is a problem
Girl is a problem
Girl is a problem, problem
Ooh baby, you so bad, boy
Drive me mad, boy
But you don’t care what they say about me
That girl is a problem
Girl is a problem
Girl is a problem, problem

[Breakdown]
That girl is a god damn problem
That girl is a god damn problem
That girl is a god damn problem

[Bridge]
We're hell-raising, and we don’t need saving
'Cause there's no salvation for a bad girl
We're rock bottom, but there ain't no stopping
'Cause they don’t know nothing about love
We're hell raising, and we don't need saving
'Cause there's no salvation for a bad girl
We're rock bottom, but there ain't no stopping
'Cause it's you and me against the world

[Chorus]
I'm your dream girl
This is real love
But you know what they say about me
That girl is a problem
Girl is a problem
Girl is a problem, problem
Ooh baby, you so bad, boy
Drive me mad, boy
But you don’t care what they say about me
That girl is a problem
Girl is a problem
Girl is a problem, problem

[Outro]
Let me see you take your shirt, shoes, jeans, all off
Shirt, shoes, jeans, all off
And we ain’t even at the beach
I'ma take my skirt, boots, rings, all off
Skirt, boots, rings, all off
And we ain’t even at the beach
God damn problem
