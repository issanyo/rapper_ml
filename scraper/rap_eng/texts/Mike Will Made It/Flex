[Intro: Yamine]
Yamine, Shea, BJ Rhymes, Brodecai
Let's Go

[Hook: Yamine]
Flex, flex, flex,flex,flex,flex,flex, flex, flex,flex, flex, flex, (repeat)

[Verse 1: Yamine]
East Atlanta with a light-skin flow
All red everything
And I know that's for sure
All these raps I make is the perfect flow
All these plays I make... is the perfect show
VBS dripping, Ya, ya, drippin' ya ya
Serving people off a scale, scale
Off a scale, scale
Making people's raps for Taco bell
Taco bell bell
You know what I'm talking bout now
Homie forget Hell

[Hook: Yamine]
Flex, flex, flex,flex,flex,flex,flex, flex, flex,flex, flex, flex, (repeat)

[Verse 2: Shea]
My name is Shea
And I know that for fact
We all make each other happy
In our own raps
We all make money everyday back after back
I love my mom and she knows that. hey

[Verse 3: BJ Rhymes]
Uh, Gucci on collar
Go call Obama
I got the trap phone
Which cost a dollar
I have the flow
And I can flex
I got the 12s and the packs
Hey
Me BJ Rhymes stuck up with them friends
Forget them figures we throwing up them bandz
At the talent show looking for a benz
Look at Michelle making all the friends

[Verse 4: Brodecai]
Oh. Look this newbie
No new phrase
I'm chasing that booty
All of this gold is just for me
I had a map
So I went over Seas
My name RJ, but I like Brodecai
I make these songs on my Blue Mike
New Blue Yeti is a one of a kind
I spent all of this money
Which was worth a dime
Now I gotta fine
From the cops no lie

[Hook: Yamine]
Flex, flex, flex,flex,flex,flex,flex, flex, flex,flex, flex, flex, (repeat)

[Hook2: Shea, BJ Rhymes, Yamine]
Flex, flex, flex, flex
We don't play with guns
What the heck
Flex, flex, flex, flex
We getting in the moment
Strapped with a vest
