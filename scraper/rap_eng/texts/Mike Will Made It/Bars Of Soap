[Intro: Swae Lee]
Ayy, ayy, ayy (Ransom)
Ayy, ayy, ayy
Ayy, ayy, ayy (Ransom)
Ayy, ayy, ayy
Ayy, ayy, ayy (Ransom)
Ayy, ayy, ayy
I'm a running man
Sandals slippin' off my feet, on the sand
Countin' up the bills with my dominant hand, yo yo
Took twos on, take this appreciate it
This too? Why tear up the rim shop? Haha
Mike WiLL Made-It

[Verse: Swae Lee]
I'm goin' postal, loco, coast to coast like La Nostra
My G.I. Joe present, I've yet to see a cobra
So off my rocker got me sippin' club soda
Some bombs never go off, some stars never blow up
I'm pitchin' and never in a dug out
Reachin' in my pants and I can't take a head count
Flash back '03, things was lookin' run down
Now I set foot in the place, it's a luau
Killin' shit like ten counts, y'all know how we get down
House with the fence around, y'all know that we in route
Transition from the Impala to the Fisker
I should charge admission for that girl to get the dessert
Left the doors up, now the Lambo' has pigtails
Since you gettin' comfy, I'ma let you sit there
I'ma let you stay there, when I shed a tear
They didn't have no care, so I'ma charge retail
I brought some kush 'cause you say you want set sail
If you love sick in the room, you best get well
Every dog has its day, what the hell? No tuck tail
Swae Lee went to magazine, XXL
Floss with your Gucci on, blunts dipped in goo
Colors burst on the cars and the jewels
I'm a wanted man
Seats lookin' like they got a spray tan
When I was without, not a helpin' hand
I got some women that throw it back and make me drop the cans
I told Ben Frank' just to drop a pin
I collect my fit goal to the highest bid
Yes, I might drop in, it all depends
Junior high, I was dreamin' of a Mach 10
I'm comin' clean though, I mean not a speck
My girl be servin' looks, I could kiss the chef
Katana sword poppin' out my walkin' cane
I'm overseas, my Cali bae like, "How was Spain?"
We gettin' to the money and you niggas havin' issues
I bought a fuckin' piece and it came with a wet suit
The Buddha left me without breath, I really am a mess
I'm moochin' off my mother-lovin' self
She be hopin' that I take a knee like Kaepernick, yes
I be open to that "SremmLife" shit (SremmLife!)
This is how we live, this is how we exist
Hoes love the kicks and we love the hits
All in the house and I'm home-wreckin'
If I sleep with his wife, I'm a home-wrecker
I'm in my own world, throw the money up and make my own weather
Mami playin' with my balls like tether, on my leather
Money talk, it's a lecture
80 pointers dance on me, it's electric
Niggas gon' hate, I'm still unaffected
Chip on my shoulder, I move undetected
She said pop the question, the question got deflected
Man them men my boy, that's my motherfuckin' brethren
Let's cut to the chase
It's only on the house when we in the place
My Houston lava boys got it up in some flames
Stirrin' up the cup with my wrist, souffle
Shaka Zulu chains with my name engraved
I told you all in "Swang", don't say my name in vain
We bring it to your door like, "You rang?"
Spendin' all the money then we watch it boomerang
With the fendi belt, angry face like Pootie Tang
Put some gold on my fingers, neck and shoestrings
"Long time, no see," that's what they say when they see me mane
I been goin' crazy, just to stay sane
Hey, your girl went missin', who's to blame?
Young whipper snapper with the Range
Pause, then I went deranged
Call that hottie on my station
Long week, but a great day
Someone got my blowin' tree like Sage
On me you should get erased
On me, yeah, you can hate
