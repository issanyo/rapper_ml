It's the Ivy League (x2)
The crowd screaming cause they wanna see a prince
So I came to this bitch to represent for the ivy league
It's the Ivy League
The crowd screaming cause they wanna see a prince
So I came to this bitch to represent for the ivy league

[Verse 1]
Gone and light a tree this is ivy league
Number 1 rule never wife a freak
Let the team hit while I'm smoking green shit
Got so much brain man I could of made the dean's list
Preachin on some martin luther king shit
I get my loud from Cali my mid come from Phoenix
Or San Diego on the block like a Lego
Arabs pay me dinars and Mexicans give me peso's
My shooters don't shoot unless I say so
I'm wit a bad bitch who look like Jalo
I gets laid cause I make chips like potatoes
And I got the swag sauce niggas call me sway go
Khakis full of paper I'm acne on a hater
Cause when I pop up in they face they ain't got nothing o say bruh
Curren$y got the jets and wiz got the taylors
So catch me in my blazer screaming out
