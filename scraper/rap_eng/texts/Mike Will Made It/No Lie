[Verse: Traphik]
Yea I got a bad chick and a new place
Flow fresher than toothpaste
They girls love me so dudes hate
You can't predict me like 2 face
Vodka and Capri Sun. my pockets, I got deep ones
They like Timmy, why you ain't got a deal? I told 'em I don't need one
I make more money than signed cats
Your views, ten times that
Got groupies, show they boobies
And ask me, can I sign that
All day I dream about sex Adidas
Then all night I pray 'cuz I'm blessed, Lawd Jesus
They say that I'm cheesy 'cuz I'm so facetious
But the world is so evil, I know that they need this
So tell me you love me, and fuck you if you don't feel me
I'mma do me, and keep on, till I blow or somebody kill me

[Hook: Drake]
I say fuck you, less I’m with you
If I take you out of the picture
I know real niggas won't miss you
No lie, no lie, no lie-ee-i-ee-i
No lie, no lie, no lie-ee-i-ee-i
Real niggas say word
You ain't never told no lie
You ain't never told no lie
Real niggas say word
You ain't never told no lie
You ain't never told no lie
Real niggas say true
You ain't never told no lie
You ain't never told no lie
That's a thing I don’t do
Nah I just do it for the niggas
That are tryna see a million fore they die
Wattup
