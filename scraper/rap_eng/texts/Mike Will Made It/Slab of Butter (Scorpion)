[Intro]
I'm 'bout to get fucked up, wanna get fucked up?
Fucked up
I'm 'bout to get fucked up, wanna get fucked up?
Fucked up
I'm 'bout to get fucked up, wanna get fucked up?
Fucked up
I'm 'bout to get fucked up, wanna get fucked up?
Fucked up

[Verse 1]
The only laws I obey, the ones I'm makin' for myself
So why you make me play on the rules of someone else?
Self control is not something I'm working on
We fuck, you turn me on, is all I can say about you

[Chorus]
I feel like a slab of butter that is melting in the sun
Aggression melts away now that you and me are one
Now that you and me are one
Now that you and me are one
You turn me on
You turn me on
You turn me on
You turn me on

[Verse 2]
Nature made a hole and now it's open full of sweat
Like a scorpion on fire, stinging myself to death
I canâ€™t extinguish what is instinctual
You turn me on, is all I can say about you

[Chorus]
I feel like a slab of butter that is melting in the sun
Aggression melts away now that you and me are one
I feel like a slab of butter that is melting in the Sun
Aggression melts away now that you and me are one
Now that you and me are one
Now that you and me are one
You turn me on
You turn me on
You turn me on
You turn me on
