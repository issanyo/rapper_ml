[Hook:]
Imma turn up to the max
Imma turn up to the max
Imma turn up to the max
Imma turn up to the max
Nigga be getting them racks
Imma turn up to the max
Imma turn up to the max
Imma turn up to the max

[Verse 1:]
Know I got pints of the lean
Know I got pounds of the gas
Water whipping in the kitchen
I'm grabbing the brick and wrapping the brick with Saran
[?]
Whipping and cooking I did it again
Bought me a rover then bought me a benz
Forgiato for a young nigga rims

[Hook:]
Imma turn up to the max
Imma turn up to the max
Imma turn up to the max
Imma turn up to the max
Nigga be gripping that Mac
Nigga be getting them racks
Imma turn up to the max
Imma turn up to the max

[Verse 2:]

Walk inside the club throwing bands up
Fuck a bad bitch with her hands up
Gucci on my belt though
Ferragamo tuie
Everything is Gucci
Money mixed with Louie
Aye, Make a movie
Yeah, Aye, Buy new rims
Standing in the kitchen getting it in
I'm addicted to that lean I pour a six
Pouring lean, pouring drank
Cashing out when I'm in the bank
Walking round hunnit thousand cash
Grab the IA do the dash, dash, dash

[Hook:]
