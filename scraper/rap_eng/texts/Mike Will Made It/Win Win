[Hook: B Smyth]
Tell your friends to call some friends and all of us can be friends
We can treat the weekday like it's apart of the weekend
Party after party girl just tell me what you're thinking
If you down, then I'm in, shawty that's a win win
That's a win win (for me)
That's a win win (for me)
That's a win win (for me)

[Verse 1: B Smyth]
Shawty you can order what you want
The perks of when you messin' with a star
If all your girls can fit inside my car
Then baby you can bring em all along
Girl if you tryna get me in my zone
Bust it open baby get out on the floor
Cause we gon be here till tomorrow morn'
So baby we got all night along

[Bridge]
What you came for if you ain't lookin for fun?
Why you wear that if you gon cover it up?
Why you dancin' on me like you tryna make love?
Got me turnt up and I can't get enough
So baby

[Hook]

[Verse 2: B Smyth]
It's bout 4 AM and we just gettin' started
We left the spot now we inside the lobby
My room will turn into the after party
Girls dancin' up in there as if they want it
Cause they don't wanna have some fun they want all of it
Whatever you need girl you can get
I got money to blow, I got money to spend
Whatever we do tonight, tomorrow we'll do it again

[Bridge]
What you came for if you ain't lookin for fun?
Why you wear that if you gon cover it up?
Why you dancin' on me like you tryna make love?
Got me turnt up and I can't get enough
So baby

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Future]
(Top notch shit, top noch stallion ya dig?)
VVS on your neck
VVS on your chain
VVS on your ring
VVS on your wrist
I'mma take you to back just to fuck on the bottom
Ooh ooh ooh, that's you're only talkin'
Merk that pussy (chop chop)
Yeah, Yeah, Yeah
Put you in that mansion shawty and I took you out that lobby
Take her to another level now she drippin' Future sauce
Put her in a Panamera now she skirt when she pull off

[Hook]
