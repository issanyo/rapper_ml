I remember being a jit really wanna smoke really wanna hit it
I was focused on the cash niggas come around gone hit a lick and
It was all about the thrill like mufuck consequences
Any nigga talkin shit could quickly get it
I ain't never gave a fuck nigga that's my mental
Niggas like she dumb numb damn right no feelings
I stay detached but she act so clingy
I just wanna fuck she don't believe me
I'm reppin that 305
Where street flames stay high
Dope dealers pill poppers outchea hustlin by the age of nine
Training like they in the army every day another drive by
In these streets have ya armor or
Say ya prayers and be prepared to die
(Nigga best be humble
Or nigga we'll lay ya ass down
Nigga best be humble or nigga get laid the fuck out) repeat
