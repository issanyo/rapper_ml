[Verse 1: Trae Tha Truth]
In first class, presidential
Money flyin' like Continental
Kill them niggas, no accidentals
They feelings hurt like they was sentimental
All I see is these hoes flexin'
I turn 'em up 'til these hoes 'plexin'
I should've known I couldn't come to chill
These broke hoes crowd my whole section
'Hood jumpin' like nothing's stoppin'
They spend the shit if ain't nothin' poppin'
I don't like no bitch that be boppin'
Can't fuck with me 'less you rockin'
Your clothes cool, but they droppin'
Your friend cool, but she blockin'
They low as Hell when I go off
Let money fight like we boxin'

[Verse 2: Rihanna]
Strip clubs and dollar bills
Still got more money
Patron shots, can I get a refill?
Still got more money
Strippers goin' up and down that pole
And I still got more money
Four o'clock and we ain't going home
Cause I still got more money
Money make the world go 'round
I still got more money
Bands make your girl go down
Still got more money
A lot more where that came from
Still got more money
The look in your eyes, I know you want some
Still got more money

[Hook: Rihanna]
Oh
All I see is signs
All I see is dollar signs
Oh
Money on my mind
Money, money on my mind
Throw it, throw it up
Watch it fall out from the sky
Throw it up, throw it up
Watch it all fall out
Pour it up, pour it up
That's how we ball out
Throw it up, throw it up
Watch it all fall out
Pour it up, pour it up
That's how we ball out
That's how we ball out
That's how we ball out
That's how we ball out

[Verse 3: Rihanna]
Valet cost a hundred bill
Still got more money
Gold all up in my grill
Still got more money
Who cares how you haters feel
And I still got more money
Call Jay up and close a deal
Still got more money
My fragrance on, and they love my smell
Still got more money
So who cares about what I spend?
Still got more money
My pockets deep, and they never end
Still got more money
I'm goin' dumb with all my friends
Still got more money

[Hook: Rihanna]
