[Intro]
Thugger Thugger baby

[Chorus]
She suck on that dick on the plane and I just called her airhead (Woo! Hee!)
I just went hunting, I found me a rabbit, I picked out the carrots (Picked out the carrots)
I'm just tired of smoking kushy, I need some Moonrock out in Cali (Uh-uh-uh)
I got a white bitch and she give me that Becky but her name is Sari (Hee!)

She bad, I might stay with her
Stack it up like a Lego, yeah
