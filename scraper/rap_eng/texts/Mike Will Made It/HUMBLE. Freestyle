[Verse]
Number one for hip-hop
Started at the bottom then I climb 'til I'm at tip-top
Harry Mack I'm on it 'yo you know I'm 'bout to rip shop
'Yo these other rappers they should probably just quit stop
Get up off of his jock
Harry Mack I do it live
When I'm off the top of this you know I came to improvise
Hold it 'til apocalypse
They like Mack you so gone, we can barely see 'ya
I woke up at 6am now I sip Tia Ramia
Harry Mack I'm in it, I came to get my bars up
Had to get a bomb warmed up croissant from that Starbucks
Now I'm feelin' good about it, Harry Mack I spit it out
Chillin' here with J Cruz, you know what I'm about
Rhymin' over this instrumental Harry Mack flip it off the top of the mental
When I'm on the mic yeah they know its essential
Matter fact step, I'ma crack your dental
Really in effect I be live on the mic
Comin' through with the- stuff that you like
One time tryin' not to swear
Harry Mack I'ma make 'em aware
Yeah one time, shout out J Cruz 'cause he's like my mentor
'Yo we live on radio so you know that its censored
If the word comes out I gotta stop before it falls out
I'm up on the radio we came through just to ball out
Yeah, one time you know my freestyles skill is vital
Like K. Dot told you my left hook just went viral
Like a Harry Mack vid
Yes I be that kid
When I'm live on the mic it was improvised I don't need to act this
'Yo, when I'm in it, you know I'm 'bout to kill it
The rhyme up on my mind, son, you know I'm 'bout to spill it
We here for Freestyle Fridays, nothin' is prepared
Shout out E-Man on beats, yeah I'm makin' 'em aware
Check it out when I'm on the mic, yeah I come off the top you know I bomb boo
Any rapper who wanna rumble
I'ma tell 'em just stay humble
Sit down, get down
'Yo we got that K. Dot
Harry Mack up off the top of the dome you know that I stay hot
So tune in on your station
Yeah we got that brand new
When I spit too fast they be like 'Mack we don't understand you'
Got to get 'yo mind up, in the studio you can find us
I'm 'bout to give it up to K. Dot
Harry Mack my time's up
