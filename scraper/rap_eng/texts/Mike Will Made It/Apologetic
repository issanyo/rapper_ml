[Intro]
What I seen that the nigga like he goin' back to back like just, to the main spot end up goin', ya know some in and out shit just like another one, here and there, or like a week later, like three days, three days in between, this one is the trap
And you stayin' there for the longest and all your time up there, that's the spot
Eardrummers
Whatlilshoddysay
Mike WiLL Made-It

[Chorus]
Lil' dawg tryna make him some money, so I respect it
If they ever get outta line you need to check it
Lockdown, had me up thinkin' bout how I'm blessed
Streets taught me to get it, I'm sorry ain't apologetic

[Verse 1]
I said boy you ain't jugg nothing, you ain't jugg nothing
Know what you did, that's a violation
Bring the hood sum', I sit back wit my youngin
We chop game out in the hole
To the door bitch we gettin' it
Know [?]
Choppers on lil pissy ass hoe
How you goin' out sad last time left me down cold
How you talmbout you gon kill sum shootin' wit ya eyes closed
That's a nina that's a forty baby never mind though
Know dawg if I'm wit ya I'ma ride out my role
Ain't gotta tell you much just keep your fuckin' mouth closed
Game fucked up but still its game time
They say woopty woop been doin' his thang now
You best of been stackin' up your change now
Pussy boy ain't playin' I want my money bitch
You stressin' bout some shit don't even benefit
He stressed some cause he knew that boy there been a bitch

[Chorus]
Lil' dawg tryna make him some money, so I respect it
If they ever get outta line you need to check it
Lockdown, had me up thinkin' bout how I'm blessed
Streets taught me to get it, I'm sorry ain't apologetic
Lil' dawg tryna make him some money, so I respect it
If they ever get outta line you need to check it
Lockdown, had me up thinkin' bout how I'm blessed
Streets taught me to get it, I'm sorry ain't apologetic

[Verse 2]
I'm sorry but I can't be sorry for being me
I'm sorry but I can't be out chasin' nann freak
Them Rari's lookin' enticing I'm good wit a Bentley though
Firestone, in me, plenty henny and hoes
Youngn ain't been havin' nothin' he hustlin' but goin' backwards
Case is wide open I feel ya been through ya chapter
Lockdown, opened my eyes and I seen the bullshit
How you leave your holmes on stuck, boy you the bullshit
Solo most the time when I'm ridin', business I'm mindin'
Old friends showed me gangsters tell too, won't mind it
Old hundreds put up with them blue barely been grindin'
Old bitches lookin' for my line I know they dyin'

[Chorus]
Lil' dawg tryna make him some money, so I respect it
If they ever get outta line you need to check it
Lockdown, had me up thinkin' bout how I'm blessed
Streets taught me to get it, I'm sorry ain't apologetic
Lil' dawg tryna make him some money, so I respect it
If they ever get outta line you need to check it
Lockdown, had me up thinkin' bout how I'm blessed
Streets taught me to get it, I'm sorry ain't apologetic
