[Hook: Skeme]
I swear I don't know who worse
These lame niggas or these square bitches
They both be working my nerves
It's so hard to tell who worse
These lying bitches or these broke niggas
They both be working my nerves
Man I swear I don't know who worse
These sucker niggas or these thirsty hoes
They both be working my nerves
Man I swear I don't know who worse
These lame niggas or these square bitches
They both be working my nerves

[Verse 1: Skeme]
Sox Gang nigga, make the world twist
I'm on the throne and my lap where your girl sit
Talk paper when you talking to the Duke
Any other conversation nigga I just ain't concerned with
Flow flame, burn haters in the third degree
Niggas got to be deaf if they ain't heard of me
I've been geeked by the week no sleep, no complaints out of me
Young Skeme well oiled machine
Keep a bitch in the back, a hoe in the front
One blowing me down the other blowing me up
I got a forty tucked, that's a forty to bust
Hardly missing, even if you duck a forty up
I'm from Inglewood, they already know what's up
Off-brand niggas talk sound foreign to us
Get your lady, why the bitch keep blowing me up
And you treat her like a queen but she be hoeing with us
Duke!

[Hook: Skeme]

[Verse 2: Danny Loc]
All these broke niggas get on my nerves
And you gullible bitches believing everything you heard
Real niggas like myself get everything we deserve
Better learn nigga, we gon' burn nigga on this private reserve
And I'm a earn my respect, all my haters gonna remain wack
If I don't got it, the big homie stay strapped
Fame can't change a nigga lane cause I'm laidback
Real hood nigga caught fades by the train tracks
Why you steady fucking with me like you want some?
But none of you niggas know what I come from
Homies locked up, dead gone keep my head strong
Breaking from the feds, that shit be looking like fun run
Stayed down, I ain't dealing with the same clowns
I've been out hear trying to make it happen since the playground
Yeah my nigga Skeme hit me with a scheme and we hit the scene
From the bottom, it ain't shit you can say now

[Hook: Skeme]

[Verse 3: Skeme, Donny Loc]
And that's real shit, you a simp if you don't relate
In the state pimping hoes and that's word to a skank
At a bank see a bitch with a purse, I'm a snatch it
Unattach your bitch, ways to make it happen
Presidential rollie got me plotting about the White House
Every time I drop a new flow rappers take a bite out
Lately I've been shining, niggas want to turn my light out
But the loaded FN in, wipe any problem right out
Woah!
Niggas coming up from below
Got a fat stack, I'm a class act with the flow
Got a black mat, nigga better act like he know
I don't trap shit but the sack fact for the whole hood
Gotta get it unapologetic by my methods
Murder be my profession that be on and off the record
Me? I'm one of the illest that came up my section
Only rappers I be feeling can test me are peacefully resting
Hol' up
