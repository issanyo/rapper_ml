Mike Will Made-It

[Chorus: Swae Lee]
You can look me in my eyes and tell I'm tired of trying
Look me in the eyes and tell that I've cried
Plenty rockstar scars, I'm not tryna hide them
Remember those who win, not the ones tired
Look into my eyes, tell me what is it you see?
Lately, watching you, watching me
Lately, watching you, watching me
Look into my eyes, tell me what is it you see?
Lately, watching you, watching me
Angry, watching you, watching me

[Verse 1: Kodak Black]
I've been thuggin' for so long tryna bypass
I be doin' so much wrong, I see my life flash
Through the pain, I persevered and I ain't even shed a tear
Overcomin' every obstacle like I ain't got no fear
And don't you know it wasn't easy, ayy
What you thinking when you see me? Yo
Even when the sun goes down, I'm up tryna keep my family straight
I just be holdin' it down and every real nigga gonna gravitate
Every day ten toes down, I swear I ain't never goin' down this way
My nigga, I'm not your man, you don't know me, I ain't from 'round this way
Go hard, I'ma die when I sleep
Go hard, I can sleep when I die
Tryna find a piece of my mind

[Chorus: Swae Lee]
You can look me in my eyes and tell I'm tired of trying
Look me in the eyes and tell that I've cried
Plenty rockstar scars, I'm not tryna hide them
Remember those who win, not the ones tired
Look into my eyes, tell me what is it you see?
Lately, watching you, watching me
Lately, watching you, watching me
Look into my eyes, tell me what is it you see?
Lately, watching you, watching me
Angry, watching you, watching me

[Verse 2: Slim Jxmmi]
Eh, ever since I came up, yeah, I've been
Living like tomorrow ain't gon' come
Switching girls like my heart can't go numb
Pedal to the floor like I'm on the run
All this shine, all the rain gotta glum
Gotta get mine or it's back to the slums
Back to the crumbs
I don't feel the pain, I need a little luck
And I puff my herb and I sip my drink
'Til my words get slurred
I work that bitch 'til she work my nerves
And then move on to the next city like "word"
What I do is none of your concern
I take my shot, you can wait your turn
Every single thing I got I earned
'Cause every single loss is lesson learned, yeah (Jxm!)

[Pre-Chorus: Swae Lee]
You're the reason why my back is turned (You're the reason)
Only took one time for me to learn
I won't say a thing you don't deserve
I won't do a thing you don't deserve (Yeah)
I x you out, what for?
Because survival's my only choice
I'm living life like I know it's short
Oh, it's a miracle to find remorse

[Chorus: Swae Lee]
You can look me in my eyes and tell I'm tired of trying
Look me in the eyes and tell that I've cried
Plenty rockstar scars, I'm not tryna hide them
Remember those who win, not the ones tired
Look into my eyes, tell me what is it you see?
Lately, watching you, watching me
Lately, watching you, watching me
Look into my eyes, tell me what is it you see?
Lately, watching you, watching me
Angry, watching you, watching me
