[Hook 1: B.o.B]
Looking at the world through my rear-view
Searching for an answer up high
But is it all wasted time?
Everything is crumbling around me
Feels like the ending of the times
Or is it all just a sign?

[Verse 1: B.o.B]
Uh, I dozed off in my notebook
Ever since, never woke up
Hey, I've been traveling for lifetimes
Still I got many miles before it's over
Yeah, I kept it hundred like I'm suppose to
But everything in the world ain't kosher
See it's crazy when your friends turn to strangers
But then strangers running up like they know you
And the further away from reality I go
I can feel the truth getting closer
But hey, it's a path that we all on
If you in the fast lane or the slow one
And you might break down on the shoulder
You just gotta know who to call for the tow-truck
I guess we all gotta exit to the next boulevard when the road's up

[Hook 2: B.o.B]
Looking at the world through my rear-view
Searching for an answer up high
But is it all wasted time?
Simulated automated breakthroughs
Everything appears to be fine
Or are we all digitized?
Everything is crumbling around me
Feels like the ending of the times
Or is it all just a sign?

[Interlude: Playboy Tre]
Yeah, sometimes
Sometimes I'm wondering if what I'm seeing in front of me
Is even real

[Verse 2: Playboy Tre]
Yeah, gon' roll up some of that killa
We call this slasher smoking
Gone off those Michael Myers
I can barely keep my lashes open
6 shots of the rum I'm done
Thinking about my partners death
I'm angry, in a flash he was gone
Man how can that day not rearrange me
All of my days, they cloudy
All of my nights, they rowdy
He told me "'Tre keep suckers in your rear view"
If so IÂ´m smashing proudly
Is it all in my head?
Am I just wasting time?
All of my rear-view mirror
Looking for answers 'bout to lose my mind

[Hook 3: B.o.B]
Looking at the world through my rear-view
Searching for an answer up high
But is it all wasted time?
Simulated automated breakthroughs
Everything appears to be fine
Or are we all digitized?
They say you only get one life time
Then it's gone in a blink of an eye
Or is it all just in my mind?
Everything is crumbling around me
Feels like the ending of the times
Or is it all just a sign?

[Bridge: B.o.B]
I saw the lights dancing up so high
I wonder is it really a sign?
Or just imagination, imagination
As golden rivers flooded off the sky
Pouring from the sands of time
Congratulations, we finally made it
I saw the lights dancing up so high
