[Verse]
PARAPHRASE Pac, all pupils on me
Boredom catching bodies, better call BT
DATABASE to ya face, like OMG:
Choice of any engine, got whips for free
Indiana Jones, I put whips to the cheeks
Going Gambino: got Freaks and Geeks:
Geek Squad, Lit Squad, I'm on my Teach
MLA Mafia, and I'm Big Meech
Topics on deck, so put ya techs on sleep
No blood round here 'cept PLAGIARIST thieves
Yeezus done put blood on the leaves*
But his moms was a prof, murdered first degree
Reload that Chrome that done slain Deweys
99 problems? THESES ain't these!
Revise my lines, But I scorn y'all peeps
Only in my class to catch some Z's
WHO TAUGHT YA?

Remote rewind unwinding lines; re-listen it's profound
I more than raise the roof, double flowing the entendres;
Ice be on my bars as proof: flow whirring (flowering) in the tundras
Rushing rulers for the ring, Brooklyn Nets were housed in wonder
And Roc Nation signed Durant, but BT he bring the thunder
LIT SQUAD in the house! we deal in verse and stanzas;
I be teaching like a boss: lonely island, tony danza
King of all the beasting ballers, my offspring is Mufasa
Y'all know I'm pretty fly for white, a monster just like Mothra
Poet, singer, slanger I bang: in every genre
On the gank for the grail: like Sean Connery or Shawn Carter
Murder by a Misfit from that gat: Flannery O'Connor
The game is gruesome, more like war, and I 'Nam ya
