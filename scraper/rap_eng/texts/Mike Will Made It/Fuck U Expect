[Intro]
Fuck you expect
Fuck you expect
Fuck you expect

[Verse: Jace]
Ballin' in this bitch like Kobe
Syrup in my cup like Jody
Watch, I'ma get me a Rollie
This so much coke, I'ma OD
Prolly shouldn't be sippin' codeine
Past two weeks I've been rolling
Mike call the shooters, if a problem, we can do it
But you know you don't know me
One, two times for the lean sippers
Three, four times for the coke dealers
Four, five, six, seven, eight, nine times
For the youngin's that be doin' that dope, nigga
If you don't like me you a broke nigga
I can tell, I can tell, I can tell
My pockets got racks and they swell
Love Jesus but I give 'em Hell
Everywhere I go I'm a suspect
Me and your baby mama ain't fuck yet
But it's early as shit so man don't trip
Still stuntin' and I ain't even done yet

[Hook: Jace]
Got the whole gang here
So you know where your ho's at
Money clean like laundry
And I can't even fold it
Fuck you expect?
What the fuck you expect?
I just got me a check
What the fuck you expect?
What the fuck you expect?
What the fuck you expect?
I just got me a check
I came to flex, what the fuck you expect?
What the fuck you expect?
The fuck you expect?
I just got me a check
I came to flex, what the fuck you expect?
