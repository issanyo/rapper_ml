[Intro: Plies]
(EarDrummers) (Zaytoven)
Got the racks up to my ear, like I'm talking to the phone
Got the racks up to my ear, like I'm talking to the phone
Got the racks up to my ear, like I'm talking to the phone

[Hook: Plies]
Got the racks up to my ear, ayee
Got the racks up to my ear, ayee
Got the racks up to my ear, ayee
Got the racks up to my ear, ayee
Got the racks up to my ear, ayee (can you hear me now?)
Got the racks up to my ear, ayee (can you hear me now bih?)
Got the racks up to my ear, like I'm talking on the phone
Got the racks up to my ear, like I'm talking on the phone, ayee

[Verse 1: Plies]
Got the racks up to my ear, aw man can ya hear me now?
I'm feelin' like Floyd, after he woped  Pacquiao
Might do it big and buy some head for my whole team
Fall off in the mall bih, tell 'em that is on me
I'm a motherfucking boss, nigga you a do-boy
Bosses only talk to bosses nigga, who is you boy?
When it come to get money out here, I'm the CEO
A broke nigga can't tell me nuthin'  bih but how to  go broke
When I look in the mirror, I'mma tell you what I see:
Self paid, self-made motherfucker from the street
Gold bottle in my hand, bitch quoting Jay Z
What's fifty grand to a motherfucker like me

[Hook: Plies]
Got the racks up to my ear, ayee
Got the racks up to my ear, ayee
Got the racks up to my ear, ayee
Got the racks up to my ear, ayee
Got the racks up to my ear, ayee (can you hear me now?)
Got the racks up to my ear, ayee (can you hear me now bih?)
Got the racks up to my ear, like I'm talking on the phone
Got the racks up to my ear, like I'm talking on the phone, ayee

[Verse 2: Young Dolph]
Got the racks up to my ear
Got the racks stacked up to here
Told her bring that pussy here
Diamonds, ice water clear (It's Dolph)
All I drink is medicine, I never bought a beer
I got so high yesterday, I went 'bout another whip
Let's count up mil, crack a seal
Told that bitch real pop this pill
I just left the strip club, now I'm finna go to club LIV (lit)
Every other fucking day I'm at the bank, that's where I live
Walkin' out my traphouse, with three thousand hundred dollar bills(Racks, racks)
That's three hundred racks, if you slow nigga
(dope boy)
I ain't buyin' no more cars, I want a boat nigga
Formerly known as the neighbourhood dope dealer
All these racks got me down your hoe throat nigga

[Hook: Plies]
Got the racks up to my ear, ayee
Got the racks up to my ear, ayee
Got the racks up to my ear, ayee
Got the racks up to my ear, ayee
Got the racks up to my ear, ayee (can you hear me now?)
Got the racks up to my ear, ayee (can you hear me now bih?)
Got the racks up to my ear, like I'm talking on the phone
Got the racks up to my ear, like I'm talking on the phone, ayee

[Verse 3: Plies]
I just counted so much money I swear to God that shit just scared me she said that she bleedin'
I told her that mouth ain't bih so head me
If you ain't got more money than I got
Then you can't beef with me
If you got too much hair sittin' on that pwussy
Then you can't sleep with me
I got so much money in my pocket look like my pocket print
I got so many sticks off in this whip I feel like I'm in the Navy
You act like you got it but you can't show it, bitch you pump faking
Niggas want to talk about you bad, that what motivate me
My response to anybody hating hating what's your net worth
Question for you hating bitches too what's your neck worth
Got them racks up to my ear right now I'm on a money call
And I ain't clicking over if you ain't talking 'bout the money dawg

[Hook: Plies]
Got the racks up to my ear, ayee
Got the racks up to my ear, ayee
Got the racks up to my ear, ayee
Got the racks up to my ear, ayee
Got the racks up to my ear, ayee (can you hear me now?)
Got the racks up to my ear, ayee (can you hear me now bih?)
Got the racks up to my ear, like I'm talking on the phone
Got the racks up to my ear, like I'm talking on the phone, ayee
