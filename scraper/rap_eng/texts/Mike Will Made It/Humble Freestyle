[Intro]
Yeah, woo, yeah, yuh, yuh
Yuh, yuh, yuh, yuh, yuh, yuh, yuh

[Verse]
Only the strongest survive so we maneuver like gods
Hang with the killers at large then pray for forgiveness tomorrow
Please don't play games 'fore I aim at your brain
I'm the one to go blaze so I better refrain
Through the [?]  I'm livin' the way, that's a lot of my business
Look at my eyes, you can see all the pain that I've been through
So how did I feel like I'm Vishnu
Proud my light Thomas Edison
You better hope that they don't let us in
We hangin' like Aaron Hernandez
