[Verse 1]
Focused since a day old, watch me mold the kids like Play-Doh
Foreign chick move when I say go, watch my back like she got Halo
Every rap I drop is fatal, kids contact, I leave 'em pale
I start taxin' people, pay up, slap a rapper season, day one
Uh, niggas like runnin' with the flow 'til they get exposed
But I'm too apex to be cloned, gotta know I'm next for the throne
On the West where I roam, my amigos say it's destiny, hoe
Tell my ex-bitch "Get, get gone", now I got a new chick in a Saint Laurent
Like Anubis, when I'm dead I'm gone
If you check my blueprint, we defy all odds
Woke up to some flavors, shit so loud, got angry neighbors
And I didn't even smoke it, it's just crushed up on the table
On my Rushmore, once inhale it, lung failure
Niggas be frontin' like Brian, they pumpin', they ain't really thuggin', I'm tellin' ya
I'm from the junction where niggas be thumpin' and niggas be cuzzin'
But still made it out and I got the street buzzin'
My shit always hot like I hopped out the oven
So I gotta run it up, everyday runnin' up
Niggas don't want it with none of us
Every step shaking the earth like I'm Juggernaut
Fuck it up, fuck it up, fuck it up
Got this bitch jumpin' like we playin' double dutch
Dalai Lama with the piece, we fix the problems, let it blow
Hold your comments or get silenced on some mobbin' shit, woah
All my fans say I'm the greatest like Muhammad bitch, woah
We don't play that, we ain't say that, want no drama shit, no
We just pull up to front door, cross 'em out like Tic-Tac-Toe
Then get right back to the dough, we pay the lawyer, no one know (nah, shh)
Hit my nigga Sam up for the zittles, that's the dro' (Uh)
If you ain't a fan then you can't hit it, that's fo' sho' (Uh)

[Chorus]
Uh, be humble lil bitch, sit down
Uh, be humble lil bitch, sit down
Uh, be humble lil bitch, sit down
Uh, be humble

[Verse 2]
Yo, hop back on the track, might get derailed
I told my pastor I'm the savior, wrap a Backwood like It's tailored
Travel atlas, stackin' paper, with no label, but still major
Y'all just imitators, but this God-flow, you can't fade it
AK be the greatest, be humble

[Chorus]
Uh, be humble lil bitch, sit down
Uh, be humble lil bitch, sit down
Uh, be humble lil bitch, sit down
(Aye sit down)
