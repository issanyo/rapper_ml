[Intro]
Man, fuck these niggas

[Hook]
Tunechi's  back
Tunechi’s back
That's all these bitches screaming
That Tunechi’s back
All eyes on me
Nigga picture how I’m rolling
Strapped up with that Mac
Masked up like a goalie
Man my bitch on that coke
She snorted 4 and a baby
Now the bitch owe me
She selling pussy and pay me
They saying Tunechi’s back
Tunechi’s back
And I brought them twins with me, nigga
Click and Clack
Let's go

[Verse]
Out on bail
Work on the scale
Put some change on your head
Boy, you're on sale
Yeah I'll see you in Hell
Pop-pop, get well
Make breakfast
'Cause I got you walking on egg shells
Xan with that lean
I ain't a begging motherfucker
But, nigga please
And I aim this motherfucker
At your memories
And all my niggas Bloods
But we make you niggas bleed
Yeah, Bloody Mary
I’m the one with the money
So I ain't the one with the gun
All I do is give the word
To the one with the gun
I’m triple OG
Fuque's splitting the Sweet
Fuck bitches, get money
Mission complete
Man fuck these niggas
I ain't worried 'bout 'em
These niggas pure pussy
Pull a pearl out 'em
Yeah
I got a virgin, I call her Madonna
But I ain't trippin', her head is a monster
Yeah, we do this for real
Swear to God
I never shoot unless I’m shooting to kill
Young wild motherfucker
Pop you and a pill
Boy instead of writing raps
You should be writing your will
You a dead man
I get to poppin’ this bitch
Watch where your head land
I ain't right, I swear to God
I need my head scanned
Stand up and eat that pussy
While she on a head stand
I’m a dog, ho
Camo cargos
Semi auto
My bitch sniff more lines than a barcode
Yeah
Wish I could take a shot of Ciroc with Pac
Sorry for the wait 'til my album drop
