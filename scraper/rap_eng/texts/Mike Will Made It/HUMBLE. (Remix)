Intro
Everyone pray for me
Living that day for me
Skrrrrrrrrrrt
Skrrrt, skrrrt, skrrrt, skrrt

Verse 1 Jaisenzz
I remember everyday eating some breakfast
Tried to turn on me now you playing tetris
Every girl that listen to the song feel offended
Made his first song charting top ten
So close to number 1 Mike said you need to make some sense
Everyone prayed for me
Pray for me niggas I'm talkin' daily
Get off the stage when I rap I'm lending
Get off the stage her name Remy
Said the irrelevant chick didn't write
Remy you couldn't rap your own song you must have stage fright
My left stroke so close to being viral
My right stroke made it look like a high note
When I leveled up only me and Kendrick will know

Hook
Next time we need to be super humble
Next time be super duper humble
Wait until night
Girl got stage fright
Said she would fight
But she ain't got no might
Go to Lil Wayne he does give tips
But guess what girl you gotta give him lips

Verse 2
Kendrick is my man
He dissed Drake I understand
Don't worry we In the lambo
With the pizza guy Michael Angelo
Word on the street
Murda On Da Beat
More Life was fire
Kyle made me think that this was really inspired
Get off the gold that is mine
I took a women looking different off her spine
John Doe is coming after me
ROBLOX you see
RobloLuckyAli

Hook
Next time we need to be super humble
Next time we super duper humble
Wait until night
Girl got stage fright
Said she would fight
But she ain't got no might
Go to Lil Wayne he does give tips
But guess what girl you gotta give him lips
