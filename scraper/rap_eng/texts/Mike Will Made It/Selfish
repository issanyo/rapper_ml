You say you love me I ain’t seen it
All this money just got you fiendin’
You gon do next to anything for this
I tell you my dawg I seen it
Fake love my dawg won’t see it
Fuck all that dawg, I done felt it
Muhfucka be so selfish
I keep it pushin' like I’m on the block (yeah)
Keep it pushin you don’t rock how I rock (yeah, swear)
Keep it pushin’ like I’m on the block
Keep it pushin' you don’t rock how I rock

[Verse]
I dream of Gina that lil' nigga you livin' a fairy tale
I seen my patna get crossed by a nigga bout a piece of mail
I seen a married hoe step out on her husband for a piece of dick
Whole while I’m tryna help mom dukes on her bucket list
I can’t respect it, you'll do anything for cash say you can't help it
So I know you'll take the stand, yeah you gon tell it
I was down bad like please somebody help me, they didn’t
Left me down bad, yeah like by myself, yes they did
So I stayed down, right off by myself, yes I did
Through all that sucka shit I promise ain’t gon make me move like one
Ima keep that shit there pushin, my best dudes say they gon love me

[Hook]
