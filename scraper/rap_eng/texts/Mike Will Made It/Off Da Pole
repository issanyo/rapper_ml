[Intro]
Ayy, Mike WiLL
That's a real bitch right there, you heard me?
Shawty put a nigga on his feet
Shawty helpin' niggas eat (what she doin'?)
Shawty sellin' hair like it's dope
Shawty really in the streets (what she doin'?)
Shawty got a strong foundation
All you other hoes weak (I know)
Ear Drummers
I know, I know, I know, I know

[Verse 1]
Shawty workin' Magic City Monday (Monday)
Shawty strip and go to church on Sunday
Shawty got one agenda (what?)
Let's get to the money (let's get it)
She more focused than she ever been
Fuck a nigga, she just tryna win
She gon' fuck a nigga, she gon' fuck her friend
And she'll chill, fuck her friend
Weekdays, catch her at college
Weekends, catch her at Follies
She ain't drinkin', she been stayin' focused
She been sippin' water, they been poppin' molly
Tryna maintain a reputation
She don't got a lot of bodies (bodies)
Shawty fine as fuck, everything after
She done did a lot of modeling
'Cause she a stripper, she a hustler (hustler)
She ain't fuckin' no customers (customers)
You get money, you be fuckin' it up (fuckin' it up)
Man shit ain't nothing to her
I think she know she different (I think she know, I think she know)
Break bread on shawty, where the fence in

[Chorus]
Shawty dance and get it off the pole (pole)
Shawty pay her rent off the pole (pole)
Shawty break a nigga, fuckin' hoes (hoes)
Fuck with me and I'm a pot of gold (gold)
Fuck with me, I'm in a new Rolls
And I fuck with her, she in a new Rover (Rover)
Shawty dance and get it off the pole (pole)

[Post-Chorus]
Shawty put a nigga on his feet
Shawty helpin' niggas eat
Shawty sellin' hair like it's dope
Shawty really in the streets
Shawty got a strong foundation
All you other hoes weak (weak)
And I think she know, I think she know

[Verse 2]
Shawty pay her rent off the pole
In a Jeep without the doors (door)
Get the baby food off the pole (baby)
She a mix, she fuck with hoes (hoes)
Never dressin' down on the clothes
Always dressin' up on these hoes (sauce)
Yeah shawty need a centerfold
High fashion, she should be in Vogue (Vogue)
She a different breed, different mold
She the prototype, I'm tryna break the code
Bonnie and Clyde, yeah, she down to ride
I was on the stove, she was banging O's
Better not call her no stripper
Shawty said she a dancer
She ain't sellin' no pussy
Stayin' real, running bands up

[Pre-Chorus]
Shawty put a nigga on his feet
Shawty helpin' niggas eat  (for real)
Shawty sellin' hair like it's dope

Shawty break a nigga, fuckin' hoes (hoes)
Fuck with me and I'm a pot of gold (gold)
Fuck with me, I'm in a new Rolls
And I fuck with her, she in a new Rover (Rover)
Shawty dance and get it off the pole (pole)
