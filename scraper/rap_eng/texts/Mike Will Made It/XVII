At 17
I was charged
With a robbery
Wasn't hard
To see
The judge
Had it out for me
Actually
Quietly
I listened & learned
Public pretenders
Helped the courts
Make innocent burn
No support
We was broke
Can't afford
Mom thanks
Just a man
In a child's body
Tom Hanks
This was like
A big deal
Ponds lakes
Filled with tears
Of the pawned banks
Over the years
It appeared
That I learned a lesson
Sometimes you're
Forced
Thru divorce
To get gods blessings
Don't look back
Let Em work
Or get turned to salt
Get out them streets
Keep the peace
Or get out lined with chalk
