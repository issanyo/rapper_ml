[Chorus]
Back back
Back pack
Full of that
Cloth in that
Shoe in that
More personal than that
Doing exercise you answer that
Who questionnaire
Like ain't hear
Nothing but the fresh air
Get out of here
Back back
Back pack
Full of that
Cloth in that
Shoe in that
More personal than that
Doing exercise you answer that
Who questionnaire
Like ain't hear
Nothing but the fresh air
Get out of here

[Verse 1]
My birth place in africa
Then coming to america
Thanks to my late grandpa
Every time we spent together
Can't forget the game
Blessed with the game
Chipasha got the name
My thoughts are insane
Drove me insane one reason left minasoko
Life is a bitch give a fuck on a choke hold
Ever working talking work
On my myself what i'm working on
Tryna be the greatest what i'm working on
Fuck your stupid ass jokes
You's a lame don't wanna poke
Finna get to preachin but no pope
Have faith in what you think you know
My flow is deep no water fall

[Chorus]
Back back
Back pack
Full of that
Cloth in that
Shoe in that
More personal than that
Doing exercise you answer that
Who questionnaire
Like ain't hear
Nothing but the fresh air
Get out of here
Back back
Back pack
Full of that
Cloth in that
Shoe in that
More personal than that
Doing exercise you answer that
Who questionnaire
Like ain't hear
Nothing but the fresh air
Get out of here
