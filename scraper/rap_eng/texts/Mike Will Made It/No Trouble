[Intro: Matt O'Brien]
Takin' the AP
Calculus AB
Teeeest (yeah,yeah!)

[Verse 1: Matt O'Brien]
Ayy, I remember graphing functions and then finding intercepts
Complete the square to factor, find the answer, without skipping steps
That was all in Pre-Calc, not a challenge for my intellect
But in AP Calc, I find my answers are all incorrect
Yeah, I can differentiate with the chain rule
But that won't always work, I can't use that as my main tool
I need something good that will help me to remain cool
I can use the sum, the power, product, or the quotient rule
Use your calculator for more than just simple math
TI-84 will just plot it on a graph
Integrating X, you get X squared times a half
Don't forget a C, that's a constant, you need that
Y prime gives slope that's vital
Don't try to find it through error and trial
You'll waste your time, don't do that, that will take a while
Derivatives will make you smile

[Chorus: Matt O'Brien]
It's no trouble
Calm down
No trouble
Calm down
No trouble
Bro, calm down
No trouble
Calm down
It's no trouble
Calm down
No trouble
Calm down
No trouble
Bro, calm down
No trouble
Calm down

[Verse 2: Matt O'Brien]
Sine of X, yeah, the derivative is cosine
Just remember that and you'll finish this in no time
This advice is solid, we ain't talkin' revolution
If you get stuck don't forget U-substitution
I'm so, sick and tired of related rates
Everytime I see them, I just freeze up and procrastinate
When you get the correct answer, it's okay to estimate
Just be sure to round it to the third decimal place, ayy
Studyin' like crazy, ayy
Practice tests like everyday
Gonna do amazing, ayy
8 a.m., 15th of May
No exaggeration, ayy
We've had months of practice, ayy
I'll be ready for it, ayy
College credit for it, ayy
This that free response, that multi-choice, they both count, ayy
50-50, you need both amounts, ayy
With this extra practice, it's no trouble, we'll be fine
And with some luck we might get a 5

[Chorus: Matt O'Brien]
It's no trouble
Calm down
No trouble
Calm down
No trouble
Bro, calm down
No trouble
Calm down
It's no trouble
Calm down
No trouble
Calm down
No trouble
Bro, calm down
No trouble
Calm down
