[Intro: RJZ]
I’m packing up my bags again
I told my girl I’m traveling
Don’t know when I’ll be back again
I’m leaving I’m leaving
She like what are you imagining
Is gonna happen when you gone so long
You so absent in this relationship
We’re quarreling and she’s winning

[Verse 1: E.L]
But yo I gotta catch this flight
To a concrete jungle from this exotic paradise
If time with love is what I’m gonna have to sacrifice
So be it I’m addicted
I can’t ignore this appetite
Stay with me
Say you’ll leave and come away with me
Let’s go let’s just get out of here
Maybe we should go and chase this dream and start afresh
It’s not here what my purpose is
Is not here
She gazed at me and said it’s not fair
Just go

[Chorus: RJZ]
I walk alone everyday I roam
Looking looking for that home that I never known yeah
Baby girl I’m in my zone
And you know I never do you wrong
Going emo everynight
We fuss and we fight
Who’s wrong and who’s right
‘Cause she know that I’m leaving
Baby girl I’m in my zone
Now you know I never do you wrong

[Verse 2: E.L]
I’m wide awake in this city that never sleeps
I’m a stranger in the city of dreams
Isn’t that ironic
That back homme my status is simply iconic
Treated like [?]  to two bedroom apartments
Before I left my mama begged me to keep a promise
Saying do or die never forgetting where your heart is
To be an artist is to be a target
I will not be tarnished
While these rappers go the hardest
Watch me go the furthest
Madison Square Garden, 34th street
Do it by myself people can barely foresee
I’m banging on the ceiling
Just trying to make it outside
You dressed up with nowhere to go
Niggas is House fly

[Chorus: RJZ]
I walk alone everyday I roam
Looking looking for that home that I never known yeah
Baby girl I’m in my zone
And you know I never do you wrong
Going emo everynight
We fuss and we fight
Who’s wrong and who’s right
‘Cause she know that I’m leaving
Baby girl I’m in my zone
Now you know I never do you wrong

[Bridge: E.L]
Probably never settle down
Probably never settle down
I mean I want to
I just don’t think I have the [?] for it
Probably gotta settle down

[Chorus: RJZ]
I walk alone everyday I roam
Looking looking for that home that I never known yeah
Baby girl I’m in my zone
And you know I never do you wrong
Going emo everynight
We fuss and we fight
Who’s wrong and who’s right
‘Cause she know that I’m leaving
Baby girl I’m in my zone
Now you know I never do you wrong
