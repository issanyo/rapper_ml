Ok, ok now we feeling cranked up
Ok, ok now it's time for take off

All the dirty dancers in my dresser(Aye Aye Aye)
God that spliff, about to spark up(Power)
And these fucking demons good at pour up(Pour up)

Ok, ok now we feeling cranked up(Crank up)
Ok, ok now it's time for take off(Go,go)
Okie dokie, saucer clear for take off(Take off)

Yeah, Swae
Dressing like we swag, we are swag just like i'm a spliff
If you wanna smoke loud keep that shit to your motherfucking self
I'm jumping of this roof with this cross bearing ganja, make your baby do what ever I want, woo
When i look in the mirror all I see is pure dope, bring 12 coming at your fucking door, whoops
Park my audi backwards, bringing parties to the panthers
Snag your main bitch in a heart beat, she want to go do it in the audi
I'ma hit her with the kamikaze
Then I'ma hit it up with the panthers
Niggas need to stop complaining
Because us young niggas shown up and we mean it

I'm the illest nigga walking in with a check up(Oh my God)
All the dirty dancers in my dresser(Aye Aye Aye)
God that spliff, about to spark up(Power)
And these fucking demons good at pour up(Pour up)

Ok, ok now we feeling cranked up(Crank up)
Ok, ok now it's time for take off(Go,go)
Okie dokie, saucer clear for take off(Take off)
Ok, ok now we feeling take off (Oh my God)

Flexin like you rich, filthy rich, c'mon man cut the shit
Take a look around, not a whole lot niggas flexing left
My bitches are always hotter than whoever man i'll say it and I motherfucking mean it
I'm so high, in the clouds, looking down at these clowns, man whatever I say i motherfucker mean it
Drive my rari backwards
I took swag to my whole new level
Get so high, want to run and buy NASA
Pockets so fat I can split some with yeah
Should I send my money skydiving
Bad bitches perfect timing
I don't know why you niggas keep playing when you know us young niggas fucking mean it

I'm the illest nigga walking in with a check up(Oh my God)
All the dirty dancers in my dresser(Aye Aye Aye)
God that spliff, about to spark up(Power)
And these fucking demons good at pour up(Pour up)

Ok, ok now we feeling cranked up(Crank up)
Ok, ok now it's time for take off(Go,go)
Okie dokie, saucer clear for take off(Take off)
