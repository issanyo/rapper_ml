[Hook: Yung Joey]
Drippin' in diamonds, covered in gold
I flooded my AP, I'm outta control
I'm still in the gutter, dippin' them Os
Workin' them euros, I'm out of control
When you're gettin' dinero, more things are possible
Anything possible, anything possible
When you hustle like I do, all things are possible
Anything possible, anything possible

[Verse 1: Yung Joey]
I come from the ghetto, I just wanna be rich
Now the money is comin', ain't that a bitch
My crib like perfection, baby show me them tits
If money could talk, these niggas ain't sayin' shit
Ain't afraid of the po-po, pussy nigga I'm lit
I take care of my family, you spend cake on a bitch
You gon' get her the Louis bag, I'ma give her this dick
She gon' come back for more, call that money well spent
I started from zero, took that to a hunnid
Brought that to a thou wow, now play with them stacks now
Catch me in traffic, but that could be tragic
Got a couple new shooters, get you laid in a casket

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Dej Loaf]
You're my type for sure, I'm tryna see what shorty 'bout
Thugged out, pants sag with a .40 cal
I was in Vogue, they wrote me an article
I want that cover, anything's possible
How is it possible you on my dick?
I don't even got one, man this shit is sick
My grandma confused me like fuck as a kid
I had no idea she was more like a pimp
Bitch I get money
My niggas not starvin', my niggas not starvin'
My niggas not starvin'
I'm drinkin' my Hennessy listenin' to Marvin

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Yung Joey]
Overcomin' the obstacles, these niggas popsicles
Ridin' dick like a prostitute, for that cake I'm in high pursuit
Word to my mommy, I stay with that Lami
Dare you to play, I'm not with the flexin', I'm down for that homi'
I got a lady, she got a lady
But if you fuck my lady, then you gotta pay me
These bitches, they love the kid, and you know that
Don't play them games I used to, I'm like a throwback
You treat the special, Bobby Womack
Me? Fuck no, can't picture that with a Kodak
On the run like Jay Z, I got me a Beyonc√©
Just to sit with me courtside, watch the Knicks at the Barclays
