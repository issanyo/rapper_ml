[Intro: DON RYAN and Trouble]
(Back, bring it-bring it back, bring it back, back)
Aye, aye, aye
(Bring it back, bring it-bring it back, back)
I heard Tyler talkin' about bring it back
So I thought I would...
(Bring it back, bring it-bring it back, bring it back, back)
Aye, aye, aye, aye

[Verse: DON RYAN]
Who's on my set
Got you, boo!
When she fret
She threaten me with sex
Doctor Who when I threat
And I'm cool with a check
Got a tool in my shed
And it drool, I attest
It a fool with the neck
It drool, bring it back
Instead, bring a noose with a knot
Second thought, I'm a fool how I shoot
Fuck the stool, you a slop when you slip
And you die, got your neck, now you dead
Then I dip
Ya'll got me pissed
Ya'll can't assist shit
Ya'll just a cyst
All up on my shit, shit
Ya'll get the gist?
Hop off my wrist, bitch
Gotta let it tick, quick
Let it stick, uh
Stiff, uh
Hit'em with the stiff arm
Try hit it back, you get slit arm
Try to kick-back, you get kicked on
When I'm with ya bitch, I get hit on
Climb the hierarchy, fall off cliff, uh
On a higher key, you just Vision
I got the Infinity shit on
It ain't ya time, get your shit, uh
So I bring it back, tear ya shit off
Shoulda gone for the head, lift off
(Lift off, lift off, lift off)

[Break: DON RYAN]
Lift off
Should've gone for the head, lift off
When I'm with the ya bitch I get lit, uh
Pull up on a nigga with the stick, uh
(Inaudible)

Bring it back, bring it back
Bring it back, bring it back
Bring it back, bring it back
Bring it back, bring it back
Pull up on you with the, uh
Bring it back, bring it back
Bring it back, bring it back (aye)
Bring it back, bring it back (aye)
Bring it back, bring it back
Bring it back, bring it back
Bring it back, bring it back
Bring it back, bring it back

[Hook: Trouble]
Bring it back, bring it-bring it back, bring it back, back
Bring it back, bring it-bring it back, bring it back, back
Bring it back, bring it-bring it back, bring it back, back
Bring it back, bring it-bring it back, bring it back, back
