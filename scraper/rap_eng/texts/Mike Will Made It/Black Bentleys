[Intro]
It’s JG Trigga!
All you bitches petty, I know you all ain’t ready
I be making money, I’ll be flexing on you dummies
Hahah.. what you got?
Got flowers, wish I didn’t go receive them
All your lies, I knew I never believed them

[Hook]
That girl is a real crowd pleaser
Small world, all her friends know of me
Young bull livin' like an old geezer
Quick release the cash, watch it fall slowly
Frat girls still tryna get even
Haters mad for whatever reason
Smoke in the air, binge drinking
They lose it when the DJ drops the needle

[Verse 1]
Boy, I’m living life without thinking
I swear I’m in the zone, I ain’t blinking
But hey, there’s money to be made..
Not giving a shit ‘bout the hate
Gon’ be in a black Bentley
Rockstar, Jimi Hendrix
Rockin’ Johnny Lennon lenses
SB’s, skinny Levi (Levi’s)
I'm a motherfucking star
Lookin’ fly, know I’m pretty
Fucking bomb, can’t sit with me
Ain’t nobody gonna bring me down

[Interlude]
Get it on, come on let’s get it on
Get it on, come on let’s get it on

[Verse 2]
On, on the rise, I've been doing good things and such
Got success, haters lookin at me with disgust
They so petty and bitter when they see me up
I throw Exxon on ‘em when it's time to gas them up
Wait, wait...hold on a second, hold on, did I see
All you bitches steal my flow like this is B.I.C (Lighter brand)
So tell me honey, how the fuck do you resemble me?
I am my own boss! No one can render me
You know I’m feeling myself, feeling that the Jack Rabbit
I’ll be dropping M’s! Like I got a bad habit
Chea!

[Interlude]
Get it on, come on let’s get it on
Get it on, come on let’s get it on

[Verse 3]
Dropping bunch of wack bitches like FML
You think you’re funny like you are in SNL?
Better watch your mouth cause all I do is kiss & tell
I can make your life hell while rocking Lagerfeld
Some of ya’ll need that K2 cause you’re too, too damn loud
Better chill out, you’ll be the talk of the town
Stay on my grind, getting mine, go get Saint Laurent
A motherfucking beast always out to dine

[Interlude]
Get it on, come on let’s get it on
Get it on, come on let’s get it on

[Verse 4]
Who said I ain’t the realest if they fuck with snakes
They don’t know where the deal is, they got lost in place
You know I am the illest, you know I always kill it
Oh boy, I am the baddest, reaching high to the ceiling
Who said I ain’t got chill when most of them crybabies
Cannot take an opinion or fact, only be hating
Claiming you a thug online said that you that crazy
But when we meet in person, you become Slim Shady

[Bridge]
That girl is a real crowd pleaser
Small world, all her friends know of me

[Hook]
That girl is a real crowd pleaser
Small world, all her friends know of me
Young bull livin' like an old geezer
Quick release the cash, watch it fall slowly (Mike WiLL fuck with me!)
Frat girls still tryna get even
Haters mad for whatever reason
Smoke in the air, binge drinking
They lose it when the DJ drops the needle
