I'm a real chick
I'm a real chick
I ain't, I ain't got time for no fake shit
I'm a real chick
I'm a real chick
I ain't, I ain't got time for no fake shit

When I look at you
I can see your fly
I know you're not real at all
What you do, it ain't new to me
All you are is custom jewelry

You're so fugazi
You're so fugazi
You're so fugazi
You're so fugazi

So you ? a shiny car
And you can buy out the bar, can you?
And you're no longer with your baby mama
That [?] be together
So that [?] to be [?]
And you don't just wanna get in my drawers
I ain't saying that you don't want me to be yours
If you're not like all the other boys
