How you wrong but your money long?
How you wrong but your money long?
Ye ain't wrong if the money long
How you wrong when your money long?
If your money long, how a nigga wrong?
Ye ain't wrong when your money long
How you wrong but your money long?
Ye ain't wrong if your money long

[Verse 1]
I just fucked a nigga's bitch and I left her in a ditch
She was really on my list but the bitch wouldn't listen
Listen, all my niggas inmates
All my niggas menace, all my niggas ready for the [?]
I'ma keep the peace, I'ma get you killed later
Niggas pocket watchin' but it ain't no calculation
Niggas speculatin', bitches speculatin'
I just want relations with your old lady
If you gettin' money, you ain't wrong, okay
Take another nigga's bitch and put her in your fuckin' home, okay
Take your other wrist and put some ice up on that shit, okay
Ye ain't wrong, ye ain't wrong, ye ain't wrong, ye ain't wrong, okay

[Hook]
How you wrong but your money long?
How you wrong but your money long?
Ye ain't wrong if the money long
How you wrong when your money long?
If your money long, how a nigga wrong?
Ye ain't wrong when your money long
How you wrong but your money long?
Ye ain't wrong if your money long

[Verse 2]
Know word on the street gotta be street
Fuck you, bitch, I'm in love with me
Just got a bag, I'ma spend it on my own
And she just got mad so I left her on her own
How you mad when another nigga bitch on your arm?
How you wrong when your money so long?
Money in my hand, while your palm still itchin'
She only call my phone when her nigga start bitchin'
[?]
Oh lord I'ma need me a witness
[?] in the telly, in her mouth like a dentist
I love my dog, nigga, fuck these bitches
She love me, dog, you can fuck my niggas
She love you dog, she just get you richer
I'm just tryna see the bigger picture
I'm just tryna see the bigger picture
She can make you Paul George leg
I'ma have to grip her like a spare
I'ma have to treat her like a kid
Mac11 got a few kids
Pitt, over there it's a pitt
Over there, everywhere I'm at it's a pitt right there
Pitt over there, it's a pitt over there
Everywhere I'm at it's a pitt right there

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
I just bought a nigga's bitch, I ain't use Craigslist
I just showed her my wrist, wrist, wrist, wrist, wrist
Niggas try to pull rich just to get this
If you ask about the wrist I'ma have to tell you this
I'm so [?], Free Lil Holly boy
We got hella bands, boy you wish you could
Boy I wish you would, bands a make you die
Ooh, sit back, count booku
Ooh, it's all I do
Ooh, they want this money
Ooh, I'ma tell the truth
Shit, gotta work real, real, real hard
And can stack that money, you can tell that bitch like...
