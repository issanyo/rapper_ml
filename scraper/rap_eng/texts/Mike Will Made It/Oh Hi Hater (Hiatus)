[Verse 2: Fortune]
I play Norman like Pandora, I'm scorin'
She foreign, but I pipe it up, take off and I'm gone, hey
Make it easy for me, baby
Being black hard enough
Million dollar plays, yeah, that type of stuff
Come here, baby, come here, girl, let me pipe you up
Tint your windows up, paper hush that fuss
Roll that pressure, extra special stuff
Walk inside the club feelin' like uh
Tell the girl I wanna see her like uh
In your feelin' 'bout a nigga, girl what
I be takin' girl feelin' like ayy
Dancin' like what needs to be, to see you on the camera
Dancin' like what needs to be, to see you on the camera

[Chorus: Fortune]
Oh, hi hater
I'm on my high, hiatus
Oh, hi hater
I'm on my high, hiatus
Oh, hi hater
I'm on my high, hiatus
Oh, hi hater
Don't do no favors
