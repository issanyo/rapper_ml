[Chorus]
Drive my heart into the night
You could drop the keys off in the morning (In the morning)
'Cause I don't wanna leave home, without your love
Without it

[Verse 1]
You told me that you wanted this
I told you it was all yours
If you're done with it, then what'd you say forever for?
If forever's out the door
I'll ignore when you call

[Chorus]
Drive my heart into the night (Yeah)
You could drop the keys off in the morning (In the morning)
'Cause I don't wanna leave home without your love
Without it

[Verse 2]
You told me you were coming back, right back
You promised it was real, and I believed that
But if I fall for it again, I will be a fool
If our love is at the end, then why do I still want you? Yeah
But I guess I got no valentine
Send me roses, I'll just let 'em die
I was crazy thinking you were mine
It was all just a lie

[Chorus]
Drive my heart into the night
You could drop the keys off in the morning
'Cause I don't wanna leave home (leave home) without your love
Without it

[Bridge]
I always knew I never wanted this
I never thought it could happen (Never thought it could happen)
You acted like you wanted this
But then you led me on (Led me on)
I thought you would be there when I go (When I go)
You promised you would be there when I go (I go)
But all broken promises, I won't miss, I'm finished
All I know are the facts
That when I look you in the eyes, all I see are the lies
Been there, done that

[Chorus]
Drive my heart into the night (Yeah, yeah)
You could drop the keys off in the morning
'Cause I don't wanna leave home without your love
Without it
