[Intro]
Ear Drummers, yeah
Mike WiLL Made-It

[Chorus: Rihanna]
Ain't none of this shit promised, ain't none of this promised
Ain't none of this shit promised, ain't none of this promised
Ain't none of this shit certain, ain't none of this certain
Ain't none of us perfect, I hope it was worth it

[Verse 1: Rihanna (Future)]
Shoppin' in Paris (yeah)
We gon' go shoppin' in Paris, nigga (we goin', we goin')
They can't even compare us (no)
They can't even compare us, we're rarer than niggas
Rarer than niggas
I never'd 'magine this shit comin' (I never imagined)
This shit comin'
We swimmin' in money, we drownin' in hundreds (yeah, yeah)
Ayy, I keep a duffle bag on me
Like Tity Boi and Dolla (duffle bag, duffle bag)
Bruh, we ain't takin' that weed, oh no
And if they don't love me, fuck whatcha talkin' 'bout
I'm in love with the cash, I put that on my mama and father

[Chorus: Rihanna]
Ain't none of this shit promised, ain't none of this promised
Ain't none of this shit promised, ain't none of this promised
Ain't none of this shit certain, ain't none of this certain
Ain't none of us perfect, I hope it was worth it

[Verse 2: Rihanna]
Goin' to France (yeah)
We gon' vacation in France, nigga (yeah!)
Advanced niggas, can't nobody stop me, I'm past niggas
I'm past my limit
I'm drunk and I'm blowin' a whole lot of gas, nigga (yeah)
Ten million in cash (cash)
Put up in a stash, it's under my mattress (yeah, yeah)
Ayy, I put the money in the ground like my nigga Frank Luke (Frank Lucas)
Got a turbo Porsche and I don't even move it (skrrt)
I'm back on the green, it's so hard not to use it (yeah)
I'm continuously winnin', my nigga, I can't see me losin'

[Chorus: Rihanna]
Ain't none of this shit promised, ain't none of this promised
Ain't none of this shit promised, ain't none of this promised
Ain't none of this shit certain, ain't none of this certain
Ain't none of us perfect, I hope it was worth it

[Bridge: Rihanna]
Ain't none of this promised
Ain't none of this promised (nope, no no)
Ain't nothin' in life guaranteed
Put that on my mama (I put that on my mama)
Ain't none of this shit promised, ain't none of this (none of this)
Ain't none of it promised
Ain't none of this certain, not even one of us perfect (yeah)
Ain't none of this shit promised, ain't none of this (woo)
Ain't none of this promised (turn up)
Ain't none of this shit promised, ain't none of this (none of this)
Ain't none of this promised
Ain't none of this shit promised, ain't none of this
Ain't none of it promised
Ain't none of this shit, none of this shit, none of this
Ain't none of it promised
I love you, money, I love you, money
I'ma never put a nigga above this money
I'ma wake up and just hug this money
Yeah, yeah

[Outro: Rihanna]
Ain't none of this promised
Ain't none of this shit promised, ain't none of this
Ain't none of this promised
Ain't none of this shit promised, ain't none of this (yeah, yeah)
Ain't none of this promised
Ain't none of this shit promised, ain't none of this
Ain't none of it promised
Ain't none of this shit, none of this shit, none of this
Ain't none of it promised, promised
