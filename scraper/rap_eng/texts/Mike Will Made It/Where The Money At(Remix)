(Verse 1:)
The leader of the new school, class is in session
So kids sit down for this fucking lesson
I call the shots on this block, like a Smith and Wesson
If you want that conscious shit go peep accession
Pass the ammo, I’m an apex predator
Won’t stop till i have 8 figures on my cellular
Trapping in my condo, you know that imma thrive
My mama always told me to get a 9 to five
I was like fuck that, where the money at
Proficient with these flows yeah i got it down pat
Assertive with these hoes when they try to pat down
They say we ain’t enslaved but even jesus wore a crown
What good is a flower if you’ve never felt thorns
A product of my environment since i was born
Up off the hinge, just on the fringe, we coming in hungry
We raiding your fridge, lights out and shit get ugly

(Hook:)
My auras is open to those who above me
Don’t open my circle, I only trust Gs
That fiction ain’t stunning, that bullshit keep running
Im out here and cunning, just waiting for something
We came up from nothing, No acting or thumbing
Im stuntin so my flow is thundering if you wondering

(Verse 2:)
Still got a few tricks up my sleeve, don’t be deceived
Disrespecting my steez that is my pet peeve
Your pains relieved, pump you full of chemicals
Ignorance is bliss, demons imprison our mentals
So why we feining for the gualla
They contoling, paroling in a impalas
Homies really out here bagging dimes to make nothing back
I’m just like fuck that where the money at
So why do you act like you stencil
You can go and earn you credentials
I just painted myself with a pencil
Tryna get a curb with no rental
Our minds are forsaken, correct me if I’m mistaken
These lames is just faking, the world is mine for the taking
When they shake me down, I gotta hold my ground
Don’t want to be a good dawg in the pound

(Hook:)
My auras is open to those who above me
Don’t open my circle, I only trust Gs
That fiction ain’t stunning, that bullshit keep running
Im out here and cunning, just waiting for something
We came up from nothing, No acting or thumbing
Im stuntin so my flow is thundering if you wondering

(Verse 3:)
Back in the bitch with a passion to split
A dutch down the middle, and get me real lit
Filled with that purp if you need it than holla
Do it for the free ain’t even bout a dollar
A youngin so proper with flows like a plumber
Come in my waters the pirates will plunder
The treasure is near, but your chakras are blocked by the beer
Kick my grind into gear, tryna be proud of the man in the mirror
Every sentence severe, come step it up you are not in my tier
With change is fear, the grass is much greener now that we here
Still a distance away from the pearling gates
United by fate, so my peoples relate
We gotta stand up and retaliate
Over an O and you get put in probate

(Hook:)
My auras is open to those who above me
Don’t open my circle, I only trust Gs
That fiction ain’t stunning, that bullshit keep running
Im out here and cunning, just waiting for something
We came up from nothing, No acting or thumbing
Im stuntin so my flow is thundering if you wondering
