[Intro]
Black Beatles in the city
Be back immediately to confiscate the moneys
I sent flowers, but you said you didn't receive â€˜em
But you said you didn't need 'em

[Chorus]
That girl is a real crowd pleaser
Small world, all her friends know of me
Young bull livin' like an old geezer
Quick release the cash, watch it fall slowly
Frat girls still tryna get even
Haters mad for whatever reason
Smoke in the air, binge drinking
They lose it when the DJ drops the needle

[Verse]
Everybody want what I have now, I ain't about to let 'em have that
Ask 'round, got the whole scene on lock down, come through "Zoom-zoom" where the cash at
Everybody want a little piece of the pie
And they think that I'm blind, I can see the disguise
And they mad 'cause I got more heat than a dryer, capiche.. I'm a beast, pull your teeth out with pliers
Yeah, I'm the one to call, 2Pac mentality like "Fuck 'em All"
I've been out there in the rain and the thunder storm, and now they all uptight like a wonder bra
But you my son-in-law, you don't have any talent, they say I'm too dope, goddamn.. it's a habit, if you come too close you're gettin' jacked like a Rabbit
Get shot and stop moving, mannequin challenge
Motherfucker, you should be yourself, skinny-ass jeans and you need some help
All these people wanna see me fail
But I'm still livin' large like three XL
Let's be honest, homie, all a yall a dead broke, it's like dyin' in jail with my pants stolen
You're pussy, period, menstrual
Give you the work up in your grill like dental

[Chorus]
That girl is a real crowd pleaser
Small world, all her friends know of me
Young bull livin' like an old geezer
Quick release the cash, watch it fall slowly
Frat girls still tryna get even
Haters mad for whatever reason
Smoke in the air, binge drinking
They lose it when the DJ drops the needle

[Verse 2]
I'mma head out to Hawaii, I can use a tan
In Canada, we screamin' "brr-brr" like Gucci Mane
It's cold out here, see the snow out here
I started at the bottom, trynna grow out here
I do it for the fans and my bros out here
Frozen as forty or below out here
I might eat Rae Sremmurd like a free steak dinner, my shit's so fire like a heatwave hit 'ya
You show by the show with the DJ spinning 'cause you don't want beef, you are free range chicken
Real shit, though, that's a fact, so put your platinum plaque inside your fanny pack, you spittin' candy-raps with your pansy-ass
But I'm the shit when I spit, where the pampers at?
I'm the nicest out, I'm what the hypes about
They try to bite my style until I find it out and I show by the crib with a rifle loud, a bang-bang.. shots rang til the lights run out
I say "Hey, hey" .. I should prolly relax, I'll punch you in your stomach, put your face right where your feet at
It's Merk

[Chorus]
That girl is a real crowd pleaser
Small world, all her friends know of me
Young bull livin' like an old geezer
Quick release the cash, watch it fall slowly
Frat girls still tryna get even
Haters mad for whatever reason
Smoke in the air, binge drinking
They lose it when the DJ drops the needle

[Verse 3]
I spent a lot of time as a young kid, doin' dumb shit for the hundreds
Now they pay three grand just to show by the function and get drunk like fuck yeah
I'm on top, lookin' down, got a view from the roof.. 'cause the movement is movin', approved from the booth, don't got a coupe but I'm usin' a fuel from the youth 'cause I grew from the stoop had a tool in my boots
No testin' me, I'm the referee, I got a squad of OGs that are next to me, if you act like a dick then you might get cut... vasectomy
We used to shop down in winters, now it's lobster for dinner and your crew all squares like croppin' a picture
We get papper like top of the printer, takin' shots to the liver from this bottle of liquor

[Bridge]
I get excited, I should prolly try to slow down
We used to pick up twenties, now we buy it by the whole pound
They used to talk shit, but they show up at our shows now
Tryna get a picture in a lobby of a hotel, oh well

[Outro]
