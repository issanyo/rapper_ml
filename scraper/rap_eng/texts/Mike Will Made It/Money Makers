(Ear Drummers)

[Verse 1: Slim Jxmmi]
These girls, these girls
They wanna move their body
These girls, these girls
They wanna move their body
These girls, these girls
They wanna move their body
These girls, these girls
They wanna move their body

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus: Miley Cyrus]
Lulu lives for the dough, yeah
Pop that ass like a trunk, nice
Lookin' so good, call it ice cream cake
Make the boys wanna cut it like a knife, slice
Got more back than a backpack wall
Throw it back while I'm on snapchat, go
MC hammer in pajamas, look but you can't touch this
No way, uh-hun, no way
He wanna taste my gummy, it's magically delicious
Put my titties on the platter and I'll make them do the dishes
