Ya'll haters corny with "Yojance Can't Sing" shit
Instagram, catch my fly and like all my shit
I'm so reckless when i rock my Zara Tiller hat
Do your own and i'll do my best all the time

I'm coming from the islands
No one can stop my grind
You mix that passion with that platano
Get Dominican bomb!

I like it when they tell me that they love all my songs
And when they ask me when its gonna be my next show
Cuz you know i be grinding, minding my own business
Found your boo on my DM

I see it, I ignore it
I stunt, yellow-bone it
I dream, I work hard
I grind til I own it
Fuck off to my haters
Snakes, cats and traitors
Fake people won't support you
Until you making millions

Sometimes I go off (2X)
I go hard (2X)
Get whats mine, take whats mine
Im a star!
And i slay (8X)
I'm Yojance (8X)

All my haters please just get in formation (2x)
(cuz i said!)
Please get off my Instagram right now
(Right Right Now)
Positivity ONLY on my timeline

And then they tell me that they saw me on tumblr (2x)
(I Dont Care!)(2X)
I don't give a shit cuz I'm doing my thing right
And I'm getting my paper
Focused on myself doing my thing right
And i just keep on stacking paper
You know theres more to do than social media (2x)
Focus on yourself
No one gives a shit
And don't worry about what I'm doing
Cuz I'm doing my shit
And i might be a Kanye West in the making

I see it, I want it
I stunt, yellow-bone it
I dream, I work hard
I grind til I own it
Fuck off to my haters
Snakes, cats and traitors
Fake people won't support you
Until you making millions

Sometimes I go off (2X)
I go hard (2X)
Get whats mine, take whats mine
Im a star!
And i slay (8X) (Can't You see that i am a Star)
I'm Yojance (8X)

All my haters please just get in formation (2x)
Please get off my Instagram right now
Positivity ONLY on my timeline

Ok haters now just get in Formation (2x)
