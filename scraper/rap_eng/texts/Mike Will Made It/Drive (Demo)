[Chorus]
Drive my heart into the night
You could drop the keys off in the morning (in the morning)
'Cause I don’t wanna leave home without your love
Without it

[Verse 1]
You told me that you wanted this
I told you it was all yours
If you're done with it, then what'd you say forever for?
If forever is out the door
I’ll ignore when you call

[Chorus]
Drive my heart into the night
You could drop the keys off in the morning (in the morning)
'Cause I don't wanna leave home without your love
Without it

[Verse 2]
You told me you were coming back, right back
You promised it was real, and I believe that
But if I fall for it again, I would be a fool
If our love is at the end, then why do I still want you?
But I guess I got no valentine
Send me roses, I'll just let 'em die
I was crazy thinking you were mine
It was all just a lie

[Chorus]
Drive my heart into the night
You could drop the keys off in the morning
'Cause I don't wanna leave home without your love
Without it

[Chorus]
Drive my heart into the night
You could drop the keys off in the morning
'Cause I don’t wanna leave home without your love
Without it
