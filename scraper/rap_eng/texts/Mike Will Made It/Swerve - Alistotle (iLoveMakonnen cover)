(Intro)
Yeah, HA!
NAMG

(Verse 1)
Back in this bitch, yeah I rap in this bitch
When I'm passing the blunt, I'm racking this bitch
I pass the blunt, I don't smoke that shit
But I rack my brain, stretch mark on this bitch
Talk about Alistotle, you can call me Harry Potter
Cause I do battle rap, lose an eye like Fetty Wap;
With the game I go to war, and all I get
Is a scar
Boulevard to the fame
Got a bullet with a name
Takin' shots in the dark, ballin' hard, leap of faith
Takin' over Cairo Scene
Straight outta EGP
Mandou sayin' Believe Me
Represent till I D I E
What up, Bill? Hear the screams?
Oh, you wakin' up; lucid dream and I'm scheming the beacon of knowledge
Philosophic with the songs and I'm looking up cause I'm a flower
Back with the rap, back to back
Like Drake, put the city on the map, uh!
Massive the masses, I master the bastards
Doin' this shit for free, uhuh!
Like a Plutarch I'ma write down how
I set my benchmark, like a blue shark
Only one Alistotle in the ark
And I wouldn't double up
Suit up if you were Tony Stark!

Yeah, let me get it back, uhuhuh, HA!

(Verse 2)
NAMG takeover
2016
Better beware, look over your shoulder
Your bitch I drove her crazy
Like a Range Rover
It's bonkers but Yonkers is where I'm headed to next
Hey Tyler, I may have
Found my wings; I'm a bird
Mothafucka you can hear me sing uha!
Park in a park
Hometown falls down yeah, call it barking a bark
New sound yeah, call it marking a mark
We embark on this trip in a barque
Bloom in the dark
Flowers and Sunshine, sunshine is here
Am I still in the darkness?
Should I think more and talk less? I'ma post this
Just like that I'ma be ...
I'm outta control, one verse is all it takes
I'm a hyperbole!
I been hibernating, in a dormant state
With the state of things, I'ma shut down malls! Yeah!
I'ma shut down malls
In the city of stars I be droppin' them bars
Mothafucka I'm a boss; call me Rick Ross (UGH)
I may be back in a Maybach when I play tracks
In May, pay me back
My mixtape drops like a beat, like a mic, like it's hot
Like a college course, drop me out of this bitch
I'ma live right here in the studio
I be doin' some shit like
I'ma sing now!

(Hook x2)
Grew up in a city where it's all wrong, woah
Got me feeling like I'm so lost, no
Y'all can hear me, you don't feel me though
Got me feeling so emotional
But I be swervin', swervin', swervin'
Been rapping too long
I be swervin', swervin', swervin'
All up in this song
Now I ain't tryna start a party (party)
But I be swervin' homie all day (all day)

All day, nigga (x2)
