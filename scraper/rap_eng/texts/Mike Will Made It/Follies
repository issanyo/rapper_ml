[Intro]
Yeah
Whoa
Yeah
Look
Heh

[Verse]
Girl you know I like the way you're dancing
Ass big, so a Rudder glancing
Gyal just wok and shake de damn ting
'Cause I ain't really down for romancing
Watchin you climbing that pole though
Making a Rudder go loco
That ass, it buildin up confidence
It rising up mih lolo
Gyal is u lettin me poke though?
Asking me how big it is
Wouldn't you like to know? O-
K you can see it ... no Jojo
Damn... whoa whoa
So deep down in your throat though?
Wood extending like you're getting lied to by Pinnochio
Nah, I ain't from Tokyo
But I'ma eat that sushi
Then we go bull just like it's a rodeo
Until I'm ready to soak you

Why go to Follies if you don't want a freak
Your chances like Memphis, they're 100% bleak
How's my marijuan? On fleek
I've got a ton of teak
Done know I could produce if you wanna beat
Love them teets
Ain't talking pearly whites
But I could give you some of that on top of it

Get it?
Talking 'bout biting nipples and jizzing on jugs
Pum pum approved, it get the stamp like I killing some bugs
Moaning while I'm filling you up
Sex is coffee level, got keeping me up to the tee
'Til you let me spill on your mug
Want a towel nigga? I'z a chivalrous thug
Apple bottom, I go take a bite, then nibble your buns
Feels like a porn with Sinnamon Love, Sara Jay
Lisa ann, make me skeet nah dan
Feel like a million bucks
Twerk it 'til you sharp knife... gimme the cut
That pum pum is the G.O.A.T., you should call it Billy or something
Face like Olivia Munn
Show them double D's
Have a rudder moving like I'm south park Timmy, so dumb
After u want TLC? What? I'z Chili or sum?
For you to hit the blogs and gossip, like iz Jimmy or sum

Bun that
Actually, don't mind if I do
You'll catch a contact
For weed I'z a backer, but no Jamaat
Wait... what's that? Go RAW?
Pssh... you're really high
'Cause I ain't coming into contact
Without straps

Double entendres
Got 'em on lock like a rasta's...
Hair
Excuse me lil' mama
Digging them outfits you love to...
Wear
Twerking your charm for
This Trini nigga to stop and...
Stare
I got me some condoms
So come around like karma...
Gear finna drop to the floor floor floor
Clap that ass, bend over touch your toes toes toes
Here it goes
Uh
First take a suck of the lolly
I'll give you the wood, bun a Holly
That's what a nigga be thinking
When I see strippers twerk it at Follies
Bands

[Outro]
Yeah dawg
That's my fantasy, you know what I'm saying?
Heh
Get it? Bands? Fantasy?
Yeah
Even my ad libs have metaphors
Bitch
