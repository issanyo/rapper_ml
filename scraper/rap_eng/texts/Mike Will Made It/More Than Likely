2 chainz, yeah
Mike WiLL Made It, yeah
Okay

[Verse 1: 2 Chainz]
Oh I'm deep in it, sleep in it, thinking about keeping it
Looking at them pussy lips, like I can make them speak to me (yeah)
I say hello wassup, I said how are you girl
You know I I birthday sex, Jeremiah (I-ah)
Fire flames to the other side-ah
If you scared, say you scared, ride around with bibles
If you knew what I knew, you'd ride around with rifles
And if you rap muthafucka, then you are my rival
Check my agenda, it's something to remember
First thing, don't fuck around with pussy niggas
First nigga 'round here wearing Gucci emblems
I'm a man of my word, that's the definition
This is repetition, I keep counting money
Over and over, ain't no slipping like a transmission


[Hook: 2 Chainz]
Is there money in my pocket, more than likely
I see some badass girls, we need some more likely
Got a couple chains (2 chains), on my polo white tee
I know somebody in this muthafucka gonna like me
I know somebody in this muthafucka gonna like me (yeah)
I know somebody in this muthafucka gonna like me (yeah yeah)
I know somebody in this muthafucka gonna like me (okay)
I know in this muthafucka (yeah)

[Verse 2: Cap.1]
Fresh fitted, fresh watch, push button just press start
Off sets on the best cars, got the baddest bitches hitting restaurants
[?], Benihana, Ruth's Chris, I'm getting steak and lobster
'Bout to get it with [?], like bring it partner
Man we got the kush and she can bring the vodka
Shouts out to my girlfriend, four five with that pearl hand
White girl, white rock, and we sold out, we like Pearl Jam
Plug call when that girl in, call 'em back when that work gone
Call back on my trap line, or that bat line, or that work phone
Call back with that stupid shit and your ass is 'bout to get snapped on
Call back on my second line, cause that's just for hoes to break backbones
Bounced out and I'm back on
Make it stretch and then make it lie
Drop the ice and then scrape the pot
Fuck the roof, we trying to break the top
