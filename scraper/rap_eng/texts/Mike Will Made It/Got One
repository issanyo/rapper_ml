[Verse 1]
Sometimes I have them thoughts
Like I'm too real for this shit
Labels keep callin'
I need 2 mil for this shit!
Took a mixtape
Turned it to a mansion
Then I took my last pack
And it turned into gymnastics
The crazy thing about it
I been knew I had it
I was being patient
Y'all was being stagnant
The crazy thing about it
I been gettin' money
I been gettin' pussy
Shades cost 600
The crazy thing about it
I don't need nobody
I don't need no co-signer
Talking bout I got 'em
The crazy thing about it
Everything been crazy
My girl cousin died
Now who gon' take care of them babies

[Chorus]
A-Town, we got one
Westside, we got one
Eastside, we got one
Southside, we got one
Got one, I got one
This pistol on me, I got one
This check homie, I got one
Respect homie, I got one
A-Town, we got one
Westside, we got one
Eastside, we got one
Southside, we got one
Got one, I got one
This pistol on me, I got one
This check homie, I got one
Respect homie, I got one

[Verse 2]
This Polo, not Izod
I get dough like Tae Kwon
Asking me what I'm on
I say my bank account is on steroids
Trappin' off my Android
Tryin' not to go fed for it
Cause I'm so high, talkin' I'm so fly
I don't know if I should l land for it
Addicted to codeine
My side effect is a red girl
If I buy the pussy you payin' for it
Put your head through the headboard
I say it but, I don't get no credit for it
Pull up in that short bus
Tell 'em this is Sp. Ed. Tour

[Chorus]
A-Town, we got one
Westside, we got one
Eastside, we got one
Southside, we got one
Got one, I got one
This pistol on me, I got one
This check homie, I got one
Respect homie, I got one
A-Town, we got one
Westside, we got one
Eastside, we got one
Southside, we got one
Got one, I got one
This pistol on me, I got one
This check homie, I got one
Respect homie, I got one
