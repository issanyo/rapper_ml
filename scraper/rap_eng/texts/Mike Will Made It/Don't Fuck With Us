[Verse 1]
Look, I ain't really with the talkin', bitch I'm really 'bout that action
I'm runnin' up a ticket and fuckin' bitches in traffic
Got a hundred million dollars, I could give a fuck about a hater
Oh, they be with the snitchin' and bitchin', they like investigatin'
Ain't tryna run down with that 4, let your homie know
All my niggas strapped like GI Joe, man you niggas toast
All you niggas pussy, lyin', claimin' you a real nigga
When we pull up and press your line, then we see who the real bitch is

[Chorus]
And I'm just tryna pay no mind, won't waste my time
Won't give it all to a fuck nigga
Don't wanna show 'em the thriller, nigga don't make me a killer
You all pitchin', we all hitters, don't fuck with us

[Verse 2]
I got too many felonies, my PO keep tellin' me
To piss in the cup, don't give a fuck, I'm 'bout to smoke my weed
Plottin' in the club, man I wish a nigga plot on me
Thinkin' you gon' ball, I'ma slide, you gon' rest in peace
I got a couple bands in my hand right now
Me and all my homies know these bitches only fuck with Gs
Now I can see why you hatin' me
All these bitches in the back of VIP, made that pussy leak
I can't give that hoe a place to sleep, but that pussy free
Fuckin' with my woods, throwin' Ps, in London, gettin' P
I'm just throwin' on that Project Pat, 8ball, MJG
Shoutout my nigga Juicy J, know I keep that drink on me, all the baddest bitches know

[Chorus]
Won't waste my time
Won't give it all to a fuck nigga
Don't wanna show 'em the thriller, nigga don't make me a killer
You all pitchin', we all hitters, don't fuck with us

[Verse 3]
A nigga a savage, any car that you thought 'bout buyin', I had it
My bitches the baddest, any hoe that you thought about fuckin', I smashed it
You spendin' paper and plastic, always tryna come up on a plug
Run a check up like I run her up, bitches love fuckin' with a thug
OHB, only hot bitches, out here ballin', too much confidence
100 B, ain't no stoppin' this, out here brackin', you need binoculars
See my team, diamonds immaculate, sing sing, send 'em packages
Bang bang, in the line of fire, then them niggas come after ya

[Chorus]
And I'm just tryna pay no mind, won't waste my time
Won't give it all to a fuck nigga
Don't wanna show 'em the thriller, nigga don't make me a killer
You all pitchin', we all hitters, don't fuck with us
