I've been painting a couple pictures
Like Kodak tunnel vision
Just sit back rewriting my story
My DNA one of glory
Out the mud now on stages
Your girl screaming my name
Now I really can't complain
All aboard the money train
Niggas funny entertaining
The pressure feels so amazing
Can't knock the hustle
Niggas like cows grazing and hatin
But they can't mooove me
I know where I'm headed
Yourâ€‹ efforts deluded
Never ahead
Yeah it's all a delusion
And stuck in ya head
Ya scared
Ya in the rearview
Left for dead
