[Intro: Tag]
30, you a fool for this one...

[Chorus: B.A. The Great]
I done rob so many fuckin' moneychimps
I’m a boss, ain't no fuckin' manager
I’m so playa, I may get a manicure
Pull up foreign, steppin' out this brand new gear
Cartiers just to make my vision clear
Fuckin' wit the gang, this shit that get you killed
They screamin' blood nigga, I can get you dipped
2-20 nigga, watch the fuckin' truck

[Verse 1: B.A. The Great]
Diamonds in my chain dancing
Got your bitch up out them pennies
Fly nigga, comin' out the projects
Flying here, never landing
Watch these niggas-niggas tellin'
Pull up in 9-11
Stack my trap money up, fuck the streets
Niggas glad that a nigga rappin'
Catch a big ’fro, lookin’ at my chain
Street nigga, but I'm flashy
Crack baby, break the glasses
Cook a brick and get the dabbin’
Drinkin' codeine is a habit
The money, I flip and then stash it
I hit the lick and I stashed it
I hid the bricks in the attic
No calculator the addict
A playa, got that from my dad
I always told myself when I get out the trenches
I'ma buy me a mansion
[?] look what happened?
Dope boy living lavish
I dreamed about it now I'm havin’ it
When she suckin', she so nasty

[Chorus: B.A. The Great]
I done rob so many fuckin' moneychimps
I'm a boss, ain't no fuckin' manager
I'm so playa, I may get a manicure
Pull up foreign, steppin' out this brand new gear
Cartiers just to make my vision clear
Fuckin' wit the gang, this shit that get you killed
They screamin' blood nigga, I can get you dipped
2-20 nigga, watch the fuckin' truck

[Verse 2: B.A. The Great]
Diamonds they dancing, they shining
My rollie don't tick, it be glidin'
My verses you have to rewind them
Fly nigga, seats are designer
Look [?] be reclinin'
Pop a [?] feel like I'm flyin'
Had not stand in the line
[?] if I ever return
Cook up a brick, I'm a relo
Stackin' and stackin' that c-note
In Cali I'm high like [?]
The package just [?] buritto
I used to raw finesse, the country niggas come in the town with the legal
Having my way, Carlito
She snorting dick, like a kilo
In the foreign, jumpin' out designer
Cartier shinin'
Lookin' like the plug, look at my diamonds
Bitch, they be shinin'
Had to thank new women reclinin'
Watch how it slidin'
Little trap niggas standin' around me
Watch how they crown me

[Chorus: B.A. The Great]
I done rob so many fuckin' moneychimps
I'm a boss, ain't no fuckin' manager
I'm so playa, I may get a manicure
Pull up foreign, steppin' out this brand new gear
Cartiers just to make my vision clear
Fuckin' wit the gang, this shit that get you killed
They screamin' blood nigga, I can get you dipped
2-20 nigga, watch the fuckin' truck

[Outro: B.A. The Great]
100 dollar for a [?]
Livin' legend, yeah I'm [?]
100 dollar for a [?]
Livin' legend, yeah I'm [?]
