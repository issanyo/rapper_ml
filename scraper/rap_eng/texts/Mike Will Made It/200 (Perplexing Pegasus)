Yaaaa
They already know me
My career took off like 24 kobe
Run the bmore game u can't Toby
Don't listen to anythin anyone told me
Word to my mama she don't lke me rappin
But still lov the city west side i'm reppen
U know my sniper gang got s dub dead shot
Mind do sharp I mess around and cut by head off
If and igga wanna run up on me
He gon need a better performance
Them iggas gon need some backup
Fore I find they whip they leave off in a Honda
Play wit the beat some
Wait till it click then I'm on one
Gave a rookie nigga his first taste
Now that know that they don't mess wit u like them old days
Yaaaa

Hop on wit Donny
U know by igga ride like a Harley
They ain't getting close to me
Cuz i never have Donny far from me (my igga)
Hop on wit atm
He produce that cash like and atm
One month das 200
I ain't wit them lil numbers keep it 200


200 plays yeh
I did it in 30 days yeah
Ill give u 60 days yeah
So what i did and u can slay yeah
I could jump in a Pegasus
But no one ever would let me rip
I ain't on perc I ain't on lean but i spit bars
Boi u need to keep them drugs far
I'm goin up
They saw i was rich now they messin wit shtump
Now they gon remember this tap
After this song i think i might just qiut rap
FER REAL

Hop on wit Donny
U know by igga ride like a Harley
They ain't getting close to me
Cuz i never have Donny far from me (my igga)
Hop on wit atm

I ain't wit them lil numbers keep it 400
