[Intro: Miley Cyrus]
If you came here to have a good time
If you came here to have a good time
One shot, two shot, three shot, four
This the one that brings the pretty girls to the floor
Swag drip drop, eatin' molly in here
Party turnt up long as molly in here, and

[Hook: Miley Cyrus]
All pretty girls just wanna have fun
All pretty girls just wanna have fun
Yeah all pretty girls just wanna have fun
All pretty girls just wanna have fun

[Post-Hook: Miley Cyrus]
Fun, fun, fun, fun
Fun, f-fun, f-fun, f-fun
F-fun, f-fun, f-fun, f-fun
F-fun, f-fun, f-fun, f-fun

[Verse 1: E-40]
I made a detour out the game when I was hustlin' crack
Made a couple of dollars, made a little bit of change, never looked back
You can find me at the shootin' range practicin' bustin' gats
Or in a vocal booth in the studio, bustin' raps
Put some gold on my body, got my body off Carlos Rossi
I'm sloppy, I treat my luxury scraper like a Bugatti
La di da di, she like to party off molly, Bacardi
Let her get naughty, a hotty up in the lobby, she stopped, she said
"Fortywater, where you 'bout to be?"
I said, "Follow me, follow me, follow me, bitch, room 223"
You got to pay me or pay me no attention, that's how I do
When you're born and raised in the V, Northern Cali, Silicon Valley

[Bridge: Ty Dolla $ign]x2
Your baby momma love me
Your baby daddy hate me
Your bitch wanna fuck me
I said your bitch wanna fuck
So we gon' get it like

[Verse 2: Miley Cyrus]
If you came here to have a good time
If you came here to have a good time, turn up
Mirror mirror on the wall, who's the flyest of them all?
Mirror mirror on the wall, who's the flyest of them all?
Mirror mirror on the wall, who's the flyest of them all?
Mirror mirror on the wall, who's the flyest of them all?

[Verse 3: Juicy J]
Hey nigga, I'll make it happen, turnin' her ratchet
Thick chick under my arm make your chick look average
Thick bitch, yeah, a big ol' ass, poke it like a cactus
And she got a face that belongs up in a beauty pageant
It's ya boy, Juicy J, trippy, I got realer pimps
Balling hard everyday, ratchet bitches can't resist
I stay laughing to the bank but my dough ain't funny
I run out of rap before I run out of money
When I pop a pill, that's foreplay
Now I'm all in her face like Olay
I'm like "okay", I kill the pussy like OJ
When I'm finished with ya woman, she gon' think we soulmates
