[Intro]
Mike WiLL Made-It

[Chorus: Quavo]
Mama said, Boy, get your shine on (mama)
No Tony how I get my grind on (no Tony)
Came in the game with a blindfold (blind)
'Cause I can whip dope with a blindfold (cook it up)
I can whip dope with my eyes closed (skrrt skrrt, cook it up)
I can whip dope with my eyes closed (skrrt skrrt, skrrt skrrt)
I can whip dope with my eyes closed (skrrt skrrt, cook it up)
I can whip dope with my eyes closed (yeah)

[Verse 1: Quavo]
My eyes closed like Michael Jordan at the free throw (23, Jordan, woo)
Give me a blindfold, I can cook up a whole kilo (cook it up, cook it up, skrrt, skrrt)
Throwaway (throwaway), no AK (brrt, brrt, AK)
Cookin' trade (cookin'), servin' pancakes (woo, yeah)
If you don't understand me, proper grammar, bitch, I want a Grammy (bitch)
Reppin' the Porsche, laffy taffy (skrrt skrrt), and the top side panoramic (skrrt skrrt)
Access, granted (access), I'ma drug taste like candy (yum)
44 (bulldog), damage (woo), leave 'em hangin' like a hangmen
Pull up with 'em when you do pull up, my niggas got snipers for when you do look up (pew, pew)
I got some Act' in my 'frigerator, nigga, you know it's already put up (Act')
Who got 5 on the cooker? (5), 5 on the cooker (5)
Who got 5 on the cooker? (5), 5 on the cooker(yeah, uhh!)

[Chorus: Quavo]
Mama said, "Boy, get your shine on" (mama)
No Tony how I get my grind on (no Tony)
Came in the game with a blindfold (blind)
'Cause I can whip dope with a blindfold (cook it up)
I can whip dope with my eyes closed (skrrt skrrt, cook it up)
I can whip dope with my eyes closed (skrrt skrrt, skrrt skrrt)
I can whip dope with my eyes closed (skrrt skrrt, cook it up)
I can whip dope with my eyes closed (yeah)

[Verse 2: RJmrLA]
Look, hey
Yeah nigga, hey
Beat the back up like auntie May
Only gotta trap for half a day
MrLA, if I go blind and all
Nigga, I can still eyeball the world
Bitch, I ain't got a dime to borrow
You beggin' for it, better find a church
Out first, I got the urge
Eastern nigga like what it's worth
Feed your killers, call it time served
Got heat to chickens, I can fry the bird, yeah
Whip up a drive like a car light, yeah
Keep shit inspired 'cause they all hyped, yeah
Feed all my trap, ain't no part shy
But that wheel in her back, she can part tyres, yeah
Pull up with 'em when you do pull up, my niggas got snipers for when you do look up (pew, pew)
Cook up while I trap my hood, no matter the price, I want the hook up
I can go on, want me a brick up
Watch me go warm me a brick up
We got your order for pick up
You take it too far, my niggas deliver, ayy

[Chorus: Quavo & RJmrLA]
Mama said, "Boy, get your shine on" (mama, ayy)
No Tony how I get my grind on (no Tony)
Came in the game with a blindfold (blind)
'Cause I can whip dope with a blindfold (cook it up)
I can whip dope with my eyes closed (skrrt skrrt, cook it up)
I can whip dope with my eyes closed (skrrt skrrt, skrrt skrrt)
I can whip dope with my eyes closed (skrrt skrrt, cook it up)
I can whip dope with my eyes closed (yeah)
