[Hook: Rich The Kid]
Pull out the choppa, do damage
Ride with the baby, no family
I got the racks that you talk about
Stay in the trap, I'mma break a pot
Rollie water, real deal
Drink, pour up the whole seal
Mama, I made it like Mike Will
Trippin' on lean and two pills
Pull out the choppa, do damage
Ride with the baby, no family
I got the racks that you talk about
Stay in the trap, I'mma break a pot
Rollie water, real deal
Drink, pour up the whole seal
Mama, I made it like Mike Will
Trippin' on lean and two pills

[Verse 1: Smokepurpp]
Hurricane, rollie wrist
Diamonds piss on a bitch
Get the pack off the ship
Racks fatter than a brick
I'm pourin' the tech and it's red
I'm leanin', I can't feel my head
My phone, I can't talk to the feds
The Glock is right under the bed
Stand in the kitcken, I break a pot
I'm geekin' off pills and I'm sippin' wok
Doin' donuts in the parkin' lot
Maserati and its push-to-start
I already fucked on your main
She already fucked on the gang
She takin' pictures of my chain
She takin' pictures in the Range

[Bridge: Smokepurpp]
Rollie water, real deal
Bitch, I'm geekin' off a pill
Got soo many pints, I'm just crackin' a seal
I pour up a four and I drop in a pill
Rollie water, real deal
Bitch, I'm geekin' off a pill
Got soo many pints, I'm just crackin' a seal
I pour up a four and I drop in a pill

[Verse 2: Yung Bans]
(Money soo long, money soo long)
Stain, catchin', money, stretchin'
Dumb, rich, pull up, blessin'
Pull out the choppa, I ride with the llama
So hot Benihana, still pourin' the wok
While I wipe the whole block
I'm juggin' and robbin', got rich off the pot
I'm up, I'm up, got racks, but I'm fuckin' 'em up
These niggas gon' hate, just know that I don't give a fuck
Draw down with the K, I bet that lil boy give it up
She eat it like lunch, she suckin' so long, but I won't bust a nut
My pockets on stuffin', thanksgiving dinner
I go so deep in her, I'm breakin' her bed, hear it crack when I bend her
Lord knows I'm a sinner, bitch I came out a winner
New audi, no roof, it cost me a check
