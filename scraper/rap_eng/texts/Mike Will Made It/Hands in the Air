[Intro: Miley Cyrus]
Let me see your hands in the air

[Verse 1: Miley Cyrus]
I remember dreaming 'bout the things I do right now (right now)
Like I climbed onto a cloud, scared to look back down
I remember when I was all alone (All alone)
Nobody 'round to hold me down (Hold me down)
But now, you're here with me tonight
Look at what you found

[Pre-Chorus: Miley Cyrus]
I was lonely for some time
Now it's only you and I
I won't live without your love tonight, tonight

[Chorus: Miley Cyrus]
I'm dancing to the sound of my words in the crowd
Too high to come down
So let me see your hands in the air
Let me see your hands in the air
Let me see your hands in the air

[Verse 2: Ludacris]
It's go hard or go home, and it ain't no looking back
My toughest enemy's in the mirror
Would you look at that?
I'm top five, dead or alive, one of the best to rhyme
And if I ever take a seat, I stood the test of time
Every verse, every song, every feature I was on, better know that I abused it
If I die before my time, I'll still be living through my music
I cracked the industry open, but still got this shit on lock
Even on the highway up to Heaven, Luda still will be on top

[Chorus: Miley Cyrus]
I'm dancing to the sound of my words in the crowd
Too high to come down
So let me see your hands in the air
Let me see your hands in the air
Let me see your hands in the air

[Chorus: Miley Cyrus]
I'm dancing to the sound of my words in the crowd
Too high to come down
So let me see your hands in the air
Let me see your hands in the air
Let me see your hands in the air
