[Hook: Lil Smack]
Let's start this mixtape right
Smack squads taking over all u rappers move aside
Smack the next in line
Killing all these other rappers he just on his grind
Im about to rise
Can't nobody stop me cause i know im bout to shine
I'm just living life
Working in the studio and party every night

[Verse 1: Youngcsmack]
I coming for the crown like the new Jay Z
But it's YoungCSmack not ROC
Headed to the game for okay seats
Now I'm sitting court side at OKC
All these singer girls know me like do-re-mi
Fa-so-la-ti-do but dough come first
No late fees
Kool-Aid smile, colgate teeth
The bigger that I get the more I need shrinks
I got a lot on my mind
I got more on my face
If I ain't going to get it
That day is going to waste
I'm trying to move in my safe
Like the safe was a safe house
I ain't going out to eat but these hoes stay on the stakeout
Spitting hot bars you should check the degrees
You little rappers is trash go and get the Fabreze
While I blew up on you rappers all I leave is debris
They call me new LeBron cause I'm the king of this league

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Youngcsmack]
You know me I be in and out of town
Still making plays even when I'm out of bounds
Automatic bottle popping never out of rounds
Tell me where the throne, that's where I be sitting down
I run up in your city, run the spot, run the town
Even run that motherfucker when I'm not around
Time to get serious ain't no time to mess around
Coming for the king boy I'm here to snatch the crown
Alone in my zone tell me don't it sound stunning
Y'all better watch out YoungCSmack is coming
If I ever fell off I would hit the ground running
I ain't ever been the one for forth down punting
Imma drop these hits like the heat I keep repeating
That way everyday my fan base keep increasin
It's winter right now but y'all should start your Spring cleaning
Cause when we take over all year it's smack season

[Hook]
