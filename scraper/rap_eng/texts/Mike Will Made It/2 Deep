Don't get your ass beat (I'mma beat the shit outta one of you lil niggas, that's on everything)
Don't get your ass beat (Don't get to playin' with me nigga, on Bompton)

[Verse 1-YG Hootie]
YG, look, look

Bitch nigga mad cause I'm fucking his woman
Get your ass beat, put to sleep
Dub SD gang, we too deep
Was popping caps on Grove Street
I'm smoking kush, it feel like Bompton
Bumping my wave, I stay popping
He was hating YG so I had to sock him (West gang)
Central Ave., Parmalee
Guns ring out like a harmony
1-4-2, 1-3-4
She fuck the best? I think so
She think so, we so on
Beat your ass like a Tyson highlight
I ride on you that's my type
The gang life, that's my life

[Verse 2-P. Smurf]
Bright red flag, I'm a Figueroa nigga
[?] over this green, just like my Grove niggas
Fuck a job, get that shit over the stove nigga
Smell of blow on my muthafucking clothes nigga
Grind all day, party all night
Canary yellow diamonds, Ferrari all white
They say that boy a killer, to me he all right
That nigga ain't got it all, shit we just alike

[Verse 3-Slim Dunkin]
I ain't no vegetarian, bitch I like the beef
Put your lips on the curb, make you bite the streets
Cut your fucking ankles off if I like your sneaks
Put your ass on the mud, like some Nike cleats (lets go)
Quit acting before I put you in the trunk dummy
Better break fast before I take your lunch money
You had a good show, them goons had to clap ya
I ain't want your bitch, she got a [?]

[Verse 4-Lil Capp]
See I came to the club on that bullshit
My partner outside with a full clip
And that bitch hold 100 you don't want to fight
Cause after we beat your ass you gone lose your life
So let that shit go, pussy tuck that pride in
Cause when your niggas sleeping, my niggas ride in
Grove Street killers, my niggas wilding
The chopper hanging on my shoulder like a violin

[Hook-Waka Flocka Flame]
G-R-O-V-E Street, B-L-O-O-D we too deep

Brick Squad so deep, its a privilege to speak
All my fans say "Whats up?" and my [?] meet in Greece
Living [?], code name: muthafuckit
2 Bloods in a bucket, 78 cutlass
Monsters, monsters, Gucci Mane's a MunStar
TTG, is the title of my young stars

1017 Brick Boyz, Mac-11s

[Verse 6-Frenchie]
P-I-R-U, your own sides [?] I'll buy you
3 niggas in the back of the G ride, thats how we ride
I'm a threat on the east side
Black Panther with no peace sign
Bitch I'm bossing out, look how fast I reach mine
The only thing hanging, is the pants on you
Knock you out, you'd swear I had Ciara's feet dancing on you
All my niggas trained to go, strapped from head to toe
Players stunt man, and I'll put Shawty Lo

[Verse 7-IceBurgandy]
Blood tell em where you from, West Side Englewood
Go and tell em your name, IceBurgandy from neighborhood
Clip hanging out my pocket like a [?]
My flag dark red, like a brick wall
Englewood Avenue, our parties like Grove Street
I'm a young head, respected like an OG
I ain't scared of shit, look up in my eyes
I push the line, I think I'm Suge in 1995

[Verse 8-Wood Da Kid]
First rule never ride if that nigga snitching (Yes)
They going find him in the lake, while them boys fishing (Grrr)
