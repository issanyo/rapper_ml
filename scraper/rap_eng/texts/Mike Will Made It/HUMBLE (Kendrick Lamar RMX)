[Hook]
Humble, I say stay humble
Humble,I say humble
Humble, I say stay humble
Humble, I say humble

[1 verse]
Everybody's lookin' at me like I'm not right
Like they're never seen a white guy
Puttin' inside a dick in a night
I have to try, to be quite

Yeah! I'm a tattooed guy
But dispite all of this shitty things
I don't give a fuck about it
Or what u think

Nah! You're not rap kings
Take back your briefcase, you suck in each case
'Cuz we win every situation we face (Shh)
Fill this free space (Ahh)

I know that u can't
You want the permission I can't grant
You've dick addiction, you're a plant
Deserve a ricognition of cognition, little ant (coughs)

I was choking with your clitoris
Your flow is hit or miss
Provoke he or me a deserve a little bit of bliss
I'm hot like lit torches

Never got the money
Never said I'm funny
Never had a bunny
Never had a myth to be

Never said the guilty is he
And I will never be free 'cuz with the boss i have to agree
I never act like u want
'Cuz you're little worm  (you little worm, you fuckin' little worm)

[Hook]

[2 verse]
I have to use another words to you little kids
Have to produce little shitty track but you can't beat me
Have to reduce production I'm the illest, the prettiest
You mini shit, the silliest brighter than the cities
Confused as the city is

Chaos, you suck
IOS, game they're lost
Today 'em are praying 'em, cross
Lay 'em across the road mayhem 'till the A.M. say it again (DAAAAMN)

You say my tattoos sucks, your's not better
Hope 2 trucks kill u, after send me a letter
From the beyond
I don't assure u to be able to respond

I've dyed my hair blonde
To dye your soul u deserve a wand
Agent 777 Dark Wayne Bond
(WTF I'm saying?)
