[Verse 1]
Heard your man couldn't smoke a loud, he smokin' hookah (yeah)
He ain't a dope boy, he a swiper (scammer)
If he ain't trappin' I ain't like him (ram him)
If he here today, done took his time like a real nigga, I'ma write him (write him)
If he told on his people, I don't got to know the nigga, I dislike him
Trap house boomin', Metro Boomin

Big boy sack, on no one (no one)
Bust down Rollie for the culture

Never been the type of nigga, never will be the type of nigga
That dislike a nigga 'cause he gettin' money
That's a hoe type of nigga, I don't fuck with him
A half a mil small, I been countin' this shit for hours
Love my gas stove, it brought me money and the power

Soon as junkies hit the door, they be yellin', "Free smoke, free smoke," yeah
Burnt my hand on the stove, yeah (ayy)
Le-learnt the game from my old head (yeah)
Trap calendar on the refrigerator
I just need a scale and calculator (calculator)
Trap doin' numbers, payroll (payroll)
We pour drink in Faygo's (Faygo's)
We got blocks like legos (legos)
Take your bitch to Turks and Caicos
We got meds like a pharmacist (pharmacist)
You runnin' round with informants and shit (yeah)
We told you 'bout it, you ignored the shit (told you 'bout it)
Come to find out you recordin' shit
You the type of nigga tell on your mama
You the type of nigga fuck up the summer
You ain't a plug, you a fuckin' runner
You a bitch, nigga, you ain't a fuckin' hundred
How the fuck you wonder
You would get more money then the mil you're under
I guess this ain't comin'
I can't see you haters, yeah, I'm Stevie Wonder
Lord bless the trap each and every Sunday
