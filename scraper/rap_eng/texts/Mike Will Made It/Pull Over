[Hook]
Smoke weed with my driver got a plug show her
She gon' play with me, he got the crew show her
We done got cold I stand body ain't gon' pull over
I make it two times the bezel I can't bring two toasters
I see them blue lights, nigga I ain't gon' pull over
Everybody get out my way, you better pull over
Don't understand my struggles so I can't pull over
I always been on go, I just can't pull over

[Verse 1]
Kicking the Lex carat, chop it like karate
I'ma pull up in the Mazi, now watch me
Came from the dirt, this shit still hurt
This shit get worse, now watch me
Ayy, I do not these vegetables, but I keep broccoli
Crippin' in the stretch Maybach, it's doing pullulates
Do it for my popsie, she shakin' her head like it bounce in her body
We up in the party, I hit the gas like I just run through the Harley
Ayy, double my respect
How'd you want the check, y'all can keep the rest
Told my mom before she died, that I'd be the best
I finna stop till I'm nothing but the best

Everybody get out my way, you better pull over
Don't understand my struggles so I can't pull over
I always been on go, I just can't pull over

[Verse 2]
Ay look out the window
