[Intro: Miley Cyrus & Future]
Stand by me
Oh, my darlin'
Stand by me

[Verse 1: Miley Cyrus]
I walked through a puddle of water
When I seen the shadow of a broken-hearted girl
Pictured us walking to the altar
For better or for worse

[Chorus: Miley Cyrus & Future]
Why don't you stand, stand by me?
Oh, my darlin', stand by me
'Cause we gon' make a movie, a movie
And it's gon' be in 3D, in 3D
And we gon' make a movie, a movie
And it's gon' be in 3D, in 3D

[Post-Chorus: Miley Cyrus & Future]
Why don't you stand, stand by me?
Oh, my darlin', stand by me

[Verse 2: Miley Cyrus & Future]
I ain't pop no Molly
But you still got me sweating
What happened to that feeling?
We'll never get it back
I ainâ€™t take no shots, but you still got me hot
What happened to the feeling?
I wish it wouldn't stop
We were supposed to be together
We were supposed to be together, yeah

[Bridge: Miley Cyrus]
They say that love can hit you so fast
Plenty odds are running out of time
But ours are on the boardwalk, baby
Take me as I am or not
I can't breathe without you, without you as mine

[Chorus: Miley Cyrus & Future]
Why don't you stand, stand by me?
Oh, my darlin', stand by me
'Cause we gon' make a movie, a movie
And it's gon' be in 3D, in 3D
And we gon' make a movie, a movie
And it's gon' be in 3D, in 3D, yeah

[Interlude: Miley Cyrus]
Stand by me (Yeah)
My darlin', stand by me
Stand, yeah
3D, yeah
Movie, it's gon' be in 3D, 3D, yeah

[Chorus: Miley Cyrus & Future]
Why don't you stand, stand by me?
Oh, my darlin', stand by me
'Cause we gon' make a movie, a movie
And it's gon' be in 3D, in 3D
And we gon' make a movie, a movie
And it's gon' be in 3D, in 3D, yeah

[Outro: Miley Cyrus & Future]
Stand by me (Yeah)
My darlin', stand by me
Stand, yeah
