Can't be the same all the time you know

Time after time after time
I'm never giving fucks it's like you niggas waste your time
Care ain't never on my mind
It ain't never on my mind
I find a hater then I tell 'em think again
Uz x Reap HL till the end
It's HL till the end
HL till the end
(Yeah) I'm wreaking havoc on these niggas and I know
But I'm always on the roll cause that's all a nigga know
There's ambition in my eyes
Keep ambition in my eyes (yeah)

I see a lot of niggas in the booth
But I don't see not one of 'em that can fuck with Uz
And this is real talk I ain't being rude
Never holding nothing back I'm screaming fuck the rules
Smoking grade A like we still in school
Thrashing with the 'Fits and yeah we keep it cool
Still keep it wild cause that's what Dw33bz do
Some young niggas blowing up for being fools
Been chasin' the same dream since I was 13
And on my road to success no one can intervene
Which means nothing will ever make it in between
Promise Ima raise the bar and that's a guarantee
Yeah

Time after time after time
I'm never giving fucks it's like you niggas waste your time
Care ain't never on my mind
It ain't never on my mind
Find a hater then I tell 'em think again
Uz x Reap HL till the end
HL till the end
HL till the end
