[Intro: Future & (Ciara)]
CC (Yeah)
It's poppin' babe (We gon' do it like this)
I really wanna ease your pain (For all the lovers out there)
I really wanna ease your pain
Don’t wanna see you shed a tear again
Don’t wanna see you shed a tear again
I wanna be the best of friends
Oh, we can become the best of friends

[Verse 1: Ciara]
Baby, baby don’t mistake me
I wanna get up on it right now (right now)
But if I let you take me, will you forsake me?
Cause boy, this game is breaking me down
Sometimes I dream about you
Can’t sleep without you, but boy, you got me trippin’
I try to fight and I cry at night cause I can’t forget this feeling
You missin’ me right now, you could be kissin’ me right now
You walked away, I walked away, we should've stayed, baby

[Chorus: Ciara]
All you had to, all-all you had to, all you had to do, do-do
All you had to, all-all you had to, all you had to do
Is say that I’m sorry, sorry, sorry
Say that I’m sorry, sorry, sorry
You know you want me
You gon' miss this body, you gon' miss me shorty
Baby, say you’re sorry

[Verse 2: Ciara]
Baby my body's callin' yours
But the voice in my head is sayin' no
Would this be the last time I let you play with my mind?
Cause' this beat in my heart, I can’t control (oh)
You be trynna' act hard, but I know your cards
Boy, who you think you’re trickin'?
You could have any girl around the world
But she can’t give you this feeling
I know you missin' me right now
You could be kissin’ me right now
I walked away, you walked away
We should’ve stayed, baby

[Chorus: Ciara]
All you had to, all-all you had to, all you had to do, do-do
All you had to, all-all you had to, all you had to do
Is say that I’m sorry, sorry, sorry
Say that I’m sorry, sorry, sorry
You know you want me
You gon' miss this body, you gon' miss me shorty
Baby, say you’re sorry

[Verse 3: Future]
You know my ego bigger than the earth
I’d spoil your appetite, I’d eat you for dessert
I could’ve told you sorry, but I bought the ‘rarri
You got me goin’ in the zone, girl you got me vibin’
And then I pull up in that new Bentley splurging
I’m a franchise, nigga, I know what you’re worth
Wanna go to Paris, we can go to Paris
I don’t wanna lose you, I just gotta have you

[Outro: Ciara]
I’m really missin’ you, I really wanna hug you, boy
I really wanna touch you, boy
Oh, baby won’t you say you’re sorry?
You know you miss me too, so tell me what you waitin' for
Baby, won’t you say you’re sorry?
Oh, woah, oh
