[Intro]
I told Mike, you know what I'm sayin'
Came from motherfucking nothing nigga, and and and
I'm tired of doing interviews cause
They don't be asking me the real shit
How a nigga really feel

[Verse 1]
I took the bitch out of Steve, bitch out of Steve
I took the bitch out of Steve
Then I put blonde on her weave
I took them hoes outta Soho, then I put them in Manolo
I told the bitch you do not fuck with bozos
But now you fuck with boss on the low low
I had a bitch on the side
Then I gave that bitch some pride
I told her come through tonight
Then I took her on a flight
I took you out of apartments, then I put you in the condo
I had you off in the trap room, you was the one in the bando
You didn't abandon a nigga, you stayed down for the kid
Now I gave you where to live, now you pull up in the lear
I went from two door to four door
Went from a two door to four door
From four door to two door
I'm back in the coupe
Nigga I ball like I'm hoopin', shit

[Hook]
Ask me how it feel to watch your bitch fuck another bitch
Ask me how it feel when you smashin' all this G shit
Ask me how it feel just to smash some R&B shit
Ask me how it feel when they thought you wouldn't be shit
Ask me how it feel, ask me, ask me how it feel
Ask me how it feel, ask me, ask me how it feel
Ask me how it feel when you smash this R&B shit
Ask me how it feel to watch your bitch eat another bitch

[Verse 2]
I pour champagne on you bitches
I blow the weed on you bitch
Bitches ain't worth shit to me
The kush is worth more than you
I took the bitch out the hood
I told the bitch she a thot
I got the bitch a new condo
I put her in a new spot
She know my dope on the scale
She know I travel the world
I know the Migo the LA the Reid I know Jimmy and Jimmy and Reid
We know the Drake from the Mike
I went from Mike to Young Metro
I go from Metro to Mike and I'm back with Young Will
You know how it petro
Told em we back goin' ape, nigga we smokin' so great
Nigga went straight from the A, now we back out in LA
Nigga went straight to the hills, we just got time to build
Money on money on M's

[Hook]
Ask me how it feel to watch your bitch fuck another bitch

[Verse 3]
I got a AR the Chopper
A chopper the FN, the 40
The 40 the eagle and a 30
The .38 bust you so ugly
They chargin' a sixty to walk
I'm chargin' em 70 to talk
I went from the trenches to cool
A mill ain't enough for my crew
I put a brick on a brick
Then I put bricks on my wrist
I put a brick  on my chain
Then I had fucked up the game
After I fucked up the game
Went and bought me some cocaine
Cocaine it right on my neck
And that shit come with a Tec
And that shit came with a house
What all the hate is about
I put the hate with the hate
Then I got snakes on a snake
I told Mike Will get a M
We gon' put this shit on film
Then I jumped right on a M
Then I put C on a B
I put a B on a C

[Hook]
