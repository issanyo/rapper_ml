Wake up, no make up
Wake up, no make up
Wake up, no make up
Wake up, then turn up
[repeat]

MA bag, Prada bag, I don’t even know
Louis on, J’s on, I don’t know what goes
I don’t know what goes
Fifty on a presidential rollie and it’s gold
Money’s not a problem, I get money by the loads
Milli, Lamborghini, Murciélago on the roads
Turn up, I’m swerving on these hoes, ah
Turn up, I be swagging on these hoes

I’m about to put it on you
Now don’t you say I didn’t warn you
You love the way I ride it
You love the way I turn up, turn up, turn up
Turn up, turn up, turn up, oh

Wake up, no make up
Wake up, no make up
Wake up, no make up
Wake up, then turn up
[repeat]

Been around the world, yeah I’m international
Really, really, really, really European flow
Blackanese, Japanese, big in Tokyo
Vertu Phone, cutting-edge everything I want

I’m about to put it on you
Now don’t you say I didn’t warn you
You love the way I ride it
You love the way I turn up, turn up, turn up
Turn up, turn up, turn up, oh

Wake up, no make up
Wake up, no make up
Wake up, no make up
Wake up, then turn up
[repeat]
