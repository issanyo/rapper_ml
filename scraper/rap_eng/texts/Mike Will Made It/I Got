[Hook: Young Thug]
I got bitches in the dirt just like a fuckin' termite
And this bitch must think I'm green but ho I'm red like a car light
And him against me, bae I'ma win like a pipe
And give me 8 million, I come to the rescue
Yeah I'ma protect your heart just like a vest do
And I'm a prince, I don't wake up like the rest do (no way)
I'ma ride on your ho like she a Mongoose

[Verse 1: Young Thug]
I'm in the booth and yeah I'm goin', yeah I'm flowin'
My bitch don't speak English
She ching chong and ching cho-in'
I make her sister suck me up when I get bored
I make her mama suck my bro every time he on
Money, condos, and dollars, paid, shine like Prada
I'ma holla at mama tomorrow just for a follow
Pi√±a colada, bosses make her pop it like a collar
Lord knows just what she'll do for guala (oo!)
Baby give me hat, oops I mean head
Baby ride it like a track, oops I'm meant peg
Baby suck it for a sack, oops I'm in it
News say that he was shot, oops he was dead
Head dead (yeah yeah)

[Verse 2: PeeWee Longway]
She on the same drug like me, can't wait to meet her
Pumped that dick inside her stomach like a test tube
It's pinky boogers in my pinky ring, dope boy demeanor
Givenchy vest over your heart just to protect you
Ride that bitch booty like a Mongoose
Pourin' out mud, sippin' lean out a big flute
Foreign whip wrapped can't get it got a big roof
For the 8 milli, Longway is comin' to get you
Slowin' down, millionaire plug named Hesus
I dream a genie, my bitch live in vases
They politickin' on me by catchin' cases
Packagin' OG, stash it in the basement
I got the jungle fever, that white shit
Crippin' in soowoo Kanyeezy
Dope residue in my Nikes
Thugger tapped me, said that ho mama easy
She went to hit it one night
She eat up the wood like a termite
Switcheroo, I got what these bitches like
She can't think I'm green cause I'm red like a light
My homie be bleedin' and bangin' on the right
Longway, bitch

I got bitches in the dirt just like a fuckin' termite
And they pretty much think I'm green but ho I'm red like a car light
And him against me, bae I'ma win like a pipe
And give me 8 million, I come to the rescue
Yeah I'ma protect your heart just like a vest do
And I'm a prince, I don't wake up like the rest do
I'ma ride on your ho like she a Mongoose

[Verse 3: Mike WiLL Made It]
And all my shooters on go, choppers on the floor
Nigga we'll kill you, gotta prick the blood
And we gon' rob him just to pay the rent, flex you if you wanna split
And all my blood protect me like the president
(Woah woah woah)
All of my shooters on go ha!
Money over all these hoes, she gon' go take off her clothes
Pull up and shoot you and go
We sold that [?] dope
She sold that [?] dope
Suckin' me up 'til like 8 in the mornin'
I got bitches wit' me, shooters with me
Roo with me, and my nigga crippin'
I got niggas push up on you, give you the business
He snitchin' on that case for a lighter sentence
