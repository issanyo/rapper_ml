He just walked off like went to the bathroom
But from the whole time he hit Atlanta, was like three months
Dear God
We just looked like, yeah, say a lil’ prayer out here, whatever he did
I barely, rarely ever come to ya 'bout things ya know. 'Cause I feel like you gave me a, great mind so I handle things on my own but I need you to watch shawty for me man, really love ‘em. You know Lord I live by certain rules that, I live by street rules and I hope you can understand that 'cause that’s the way I was brought up and that’s the way I was raised so, the way we gotta go get it is the way we gotta go get it. But I feel you know that my heart is pure, you know. And I’m not doing this out of ill intentions. I really need this one, I really need this to work. Please Lord don’t let him fuck over young'n ya know. I need him. Bring him back to me. It’s in yo hands, it’s in yo hands
