[Chorus]
If you're looking for love, know that love don't live here anymore
He left with my heart
They both walked through that door without me
If you're trying to find pity, well, you need to look somewhere else
'Cause I surely can't help you
I'm hurting myself
I've turned into someone else

[Verse 1]
I used to believe love conquers all
'Cause that's what's seen in movies
Come to find out it's not like that at all
You see, real life's much different

[Refrain]
I don't wanna see you go
I only wanna see you smile
It hurts so much just thinking of
Felt like this for awhile
I can't stand to see us there
We cried, we lied
Cannot pretend to take us back to what we had
To make us feel alive again

[Pre-Chorus]
Hold me close
Don't let me go
I hope
Tell me now is not the end

[Chorus]
If you're looking for love, know that love don't live here anymore
He left with my heart
They both walked through that door without me
If you're trying to find pity, well, you need to look somewhere else
'Cause I surely can't help you
I'm hurting myself
I've turned into someone else (Someone else)
I've turned into someone else

[Verse 2]
I used to believe love conquers all
'Cause that's what I felt when you held me
I thought you'd catch me if I fall
And fill me up when I'm empty

[Refrain]
I don't wanna see you go
I only wanna see you smile
It hurts so much just thinking of
Felt like this for awhile
I can't stand to see us there
We cried, we lied
Cannot pretend to take us back to what we had
To make us feel alive again

[Pre-Chorus]
Hold me close
Don't let me go
I hope
Tell me now is not the end

[Chorus]
If you're looking for love, know that love don't live here anymore
He left with my heart
They both walked through that door without me
If you're trying to find pity, well, you need to look somewhere else
'Cause I surely can't help you
I'm hurting myself
I've turned into someone else

[Bridge]
Love is patient, love is selfless
Love is hopeful, love is kind
Love is jealous, love is selfish
Love is hopeless, love is blind
Love is patient, love is selfless
Love is hopeful, love is kind
Love is jealous, love is selfish
Love is hopeless, love is blind
Love is patient, love is selfless
Love is hopeful, love is kind
Love is jealous, love is selfish
Love is hopeless, love is blind
Yeah, yeah
Ooh, yeah

[Outro]
I've turned into someone else
