Bad bitches do it big in this motherfucker
Let's go!

[Hook: Slim Jxmmi]
Shake it fast, shake it fast, shake it fast, bitch shake it fast
Don't be playin' when you see us, see us spendin' cash
Don't be playin' when you see us, see us spendin' fast
Shake it fast, shake it fast, shake it fast, girl shake it fast
Don't be playin' when you see us, see us spendin' cash
Don't be playin' when you see us, see us spendin' fast

[Verse 1: Slim Jxmmi]
Bitch shake that ass like I'm Too $hort
And that bitch spendin' cash like it's a new sport
I'm in the bitch blowin' gas like it's a new sport
Ball so hard that I need two courts (I'm goin')
Let me see you get nasty, make that ass clap
You gon' let me hit you with this wood or not?
Young nigga comin' straight through with the guap
Got a bitch in Hollywood, she good with the top
Pussy pop, pussy pop
Show to me you're worth spendin' all this guap
Uncle Jxmmi tryna bring the freaks out
If they can make that ass clap let me see it now
Let me see it now, let me see it now
Baby bust it open like she from the south
She gon' break a nigga whole bank account
But she with some bouncers so she ain't playin' round

[Hook: Slim Jxmmi]
Shake it fast, shake it fast, shake it fast, girl shake it fast
Don't be playin' when you see us, see us spendin' cash
Don't be playin' when you see us, see us spendin' fast
Shake it fast, shake it fast, shake it fast, girl shake it fast
Don't be playin' when you see us, see us spendin' cash
Don't be playin' when you see us, see us spendin' fast

[Verse 2: Swae Lee]
Well I done got the whole spot on flood watch
I can tell she ain't never-ever missed a squat
Zig-zags in my pocket I'ma free the pot
I'ma egg her on because she dancin' on my crotch
Niggas third wheelin' tryna cock-block
Young Swae in this bitch playin' with a fat knot
I wanna hit the bottom girl and your best friend
I brought a check in, that's what I call checkin' in
You know it's lit, do the splits
New phone, who dis
Like my Porsche Carrera old girl sittin' pretty
She gon' shake it cause we mean somethin' to the city
Every time she contort it, I support it
I see some broke niggas tryna put they dough together
I get to ballin' like Kobe in the fourth quarter
So much money on me I can't even get it sorted

[Hook: Slim Jxmmi]
Shake it fast, shake it fast, shake it fast, girl shake it fast
Don't be playin' when you see us, see us spendin' cash
Don't be playin' when you see us, see us spendin' fast
Shake it fast, shake it fast, shake it fast, girl shake it fast
Don't be playin' when you see us, see us spendin' cash
Don't be playin' when you see us, see us spendin' fast

[Verse 3: Juicy J]
(Juicy J up in this piece
I got you Rae Sremmurd, yeah)
Let me see you bust it, shake it like a wet puppy
Shake it like you at the crap table feeling lucky
Shake it like some pancake mix in the morning
Let me see you do it on the dick cause I'm horny
Shake the panties off, baby girl, don't be boring
Never mind the cameras girl, I swear we're not recordin'
She ain't got no gag, shawty swallow all that pipe
No wonder why her nigga in the club tryna fight
Shawty do it all, it should be against the law
Lockjaw, she can suck a bowling ball through a straw
Gon' shake that ass, make it rain, make it splash
Outta cash, bout to swipe my black card between her ass
Me you and you, let's do what it do
Leave this bitch then go get us a room
Then bang-bang-bang like John Witherspoon
And we ain't wakin' up till tomorrow afternoon

[Hook: Slim Jxmmi]
Shake it fast, shake it fast, shake it fast, girl shake it fast
Don't be playin' when you see us, see us spendin' cash
Don't be playin' when you see us, see us spendin' fast
Shake it fast, shake it fast, shake it fast, girl shake it fast
Don't be playin' when you see us, see us spendin' cash
Don't be playin' when you see us, see us spendin' fast

[Outro: Juicy J]
I know a little freak from Hollywood
Sucks on dick, does it real good
