(Chorus)
First of a kind, put the city on my (back, back)
Time to go viral, put the city on the (map, map)
Waitin’ on the check that my bills be (paying, paying)
Cause everyday I'm hustlin’ (everyday I'm hustlin’)
In this music business like a bee I be buzzin’em
Don't give a fuck about the competition (murder them)
Ain't that much on instagram but I be toe-taggin’em
I be toe-taggin’em (toe-taggin’em)

(Verse 1: NA Bill)
Who's first in line for a whopping ass?
In the Ass-ton Martin there's an ass to smash like an aftermath
My rhymes are ill mixed with some coke to snatch
Rhymes are ill cause God is ghostwriting this batch
And I believe in God but I’m not praying that much
And I believe in myself, that’s why on rappers I be preying for lunch
I call it a day off tryna take my time
Then come back and snatch it with a rhyme
Mixtape is going crazy
Guess they don’t make awards for that type of shit
Biggie came into my dream and told me
When you were a fetus in your mom's womb
I was feeding ya (yeah)
Now lyrically insane I'm finessin’, ha
Man I'm on a higher level that’s why
I can’t achieve a common ground witcha
Young at a simple state of mind
Mind of an intricate youngster
Dedication to the delivery of the vain insane like bane emotions
Or the plain puff drugs mind corrosion
Nothing less to say

(Chorus)
In this music business like a bee I be buzzin’em
Don't give a fuck about the competition (murder them)
Ain't that much on instagram but I be toe-taggin’em
I be toe-taggin’em (toe-taggin’em)

(Verse 2: Alistotle)
HUH, maneuvering in with Bill in the building (no limits)
I’m crackin’ the ceiling, abusing the music, amusing the muses
My temper I lose it at Lollapalooza
I gaze at Medusa to try to seduce her
I’m fuckin’ immortal, they said I’m a loser
They causin’ my downfall, they cooking my goose
And I ain’t got no limits
The music? I did it, they be askin’ how I did it
When I told’em I’m the last man standing in the booth (booth)
Some fucker disbelieved and now it’s all about you (you, you)
This could be us, nigga you playin’
I’m grinding hard
My next mixtape is gon’ be
The best mixtape like my last mistake was my mixtape
And I owe it to fate, it’s a piece of cake
And you lovin’ it bae
I do this for you
The magnum opus, I’m definite proof, impeccable truth
We settin’ to settle, to makin’ a living, to cashin’em checks
To stand in the booth, to starting a movement
Flowers and Sunshine
I don’t need your approval
This whole time I been drafting a doodle

(Outro)
This could be us, nigga you playin’
This could be us, nigga you playin’
This could be us, nigga play’em
This could be us
