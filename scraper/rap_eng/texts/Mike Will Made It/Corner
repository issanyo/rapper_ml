Yeah nigga, the corner can get you rich
Black Migo Gang
You already know I'm bout a sack
Nigga I'm always in the streets

[Hook]
You can get rich off the corner
Million dollars made on the corner
Nigga feed they kids off the corner
Nigga done bout Bentley's off the corner
It's some real street niggas on the corner
Them young niggas acting a fool on the corner
Everybody got money issues on the corner
You know you can't be slipping on the corner

[Verse 1]
The corner done bought me everything
These juggs done took me a long way
Swoop young nigga like the RJ
Lil Joshy on the block every day
Lil Mexico, nigga we bossed up
Don't talk your label talk boss talk
On the corner they gettin' their hustle on
On the corner you might lose everything
Shooting dice nigga might bet everything
On the corner get it back then next day
My corner got a trap like a runway
Jugg house on a one way
Thats just for my hundred plays
Drive through, driveways
Salute my niggas with brick fair
Get fucked up nigga got [?]
The corner could get you long years
Don't wanna get caught with traffic in it
That dope po-po gone handle ya, so watch who you hand it to
For work nigga, do what you do
Don't let that corner handle you

[Verse 2]
I done got a million dollar cash on the corner (A ticket)
Hundred pounds of schwag sold on the corner
In Vegas, on vacation, Jag parked on the corner
With Future on the road I left four bricks back on the corner
I just backdoored a nigga, brick house on the corner (finesse)
Numbered money issues, ain't no rules on the corner (Freebands)
You gotta be bout your issues if you say you're from the corner
Just smoked a pound of gas cost me 65 hundred
Schooled in on the flex, finessin' nigga as well
My corner like a pharmacy, got everything for sale
Remix lean and swag, stupid price tag
Stupid band jugg, she can throw it in the bag
