[Intro]
You can't stop what gon' happen, nigga
This shit was destined to be happening
Made It Mafia, we here forever
As a little kid, I knew I was destined to make it
Do something big

[Hook]
We went against all odds so we could be here
We went against all odds and now we live here
We went against all odds so we could stay in a mansion
We went against all odds now la familia is set
We went against all odds (2x)
We went against all odds so we can live above average
We went against all odds now the lifestyle we live lavish

[Verse 1]
Go to college, make ya mama proud, how you gon make her proud
Rolling stones, off ya mobile phone, what you gon do, serve an ounce
Hey, pick ya career, make us feel like we all made it
My styrofoam cup medicated, I was underrated, but I elevated
Luxury living , yeah nigga you living luxury damn
Hey, didn't you do a crime?
Weren't you like me once upon a time?
Down to your last, down to your thoughts, down to your dreams
Downing the alcohol, hoping everything would wash away clean
Runaway teens, runaway kids, I wanna live
How could you survive without shedding any more tears?
Popping pain pills, wishing for a permanent relief
Grinding all them years made you turn into a beast

[Hook]
We went against all odds so we could be here
We went against all odds and now we live here
We went against all odds so we could stay in a mansion
We went against all odds now la familia is set
We went against all odds (2x)
We went against all odds so we can live above average
We went against all odds now the lifestyle we live lavish

[Verse 2]
I'm paralyzed to the envy, I'm paralyzed to the greed
There comes a time when you gotta move on, you gotta leave
Stuck inside of your slump, tryna get over your hump
You picture you love your life, once you start living your life
Keep your head above your shoulders, don't drop your chin to your chest
If you do it, do it for yourself and make sure you progress
Keep your word to your nigga, do that nigga keep his word?
You familiar with loyalty, and I know what you deserve
A kilo 'round my neck, so dealing birds is not an issue
For better or for worse, and the day it finally hits you
The day you finally realize it's la familia, nigga
The day you become a don and put them first, nigga

[Hook]
We went against all odds so we could be here
We went against all odds and now we live here
We went against all odds so we could stay in a mansion
We went against all odds now la familia is set
We went against all odds (2x)
We went against all odds so we can live above average
We went against all odds now the lifestyle we live lavish
