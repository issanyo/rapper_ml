[Intro: Farmer Vish]
Susan B. Anthony, Lucretia Mott
Elizabeth Cady Stanton
That's alot of women to roast
Straight killers from the coast
East side reppin young
Vish, I, Neemus
With the dose

[Verse 1: Farmer Vish]
First we start off with Susan
Your newspaper got me snoozin'
"The Revolution" it was callled
It got all my boys appalled
You want to vote
Not gonna happen
I'm spitting fire
Just like a dragon
Seneca Falls 1848
You set up an event
On this date
You called it a convention
Laugh out loud
Your hopes so high
They in the clouds
We done with you
On to the next
Lucretia you're up
Against the best!

[Verse 2: Bad Boy i]
Yo it's me, Bad Boy i
What a time to be alive
To be a guy, To be so fly
My flow is so hot
It's mid-July
You old hag
Named Lucretia
Your skin looks like
I tried to crease ya
1840
Started your flight
Hope's so high
Get off your flight
Declaration of Sentiments
How do I put this delicate?
You copied the
Declaration of Independence
Now I'm done
With my part
Finna cop some J's
Call me Paul Blart
Vish take it away

[Verse 3: Farmer Vish]
First of all
Your name's so long
I tried saying it
I was talking lifelong
This ain't ping pong
No back and forth
Just me killing
You're running back and forth
They call you Prezi
Of the NWSA
About to present this rap to
Mr. Keahey
