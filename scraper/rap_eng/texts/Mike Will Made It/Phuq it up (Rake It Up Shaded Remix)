[Intro]
J-A-Y
Yo
This was a request
Most of these was fuckin' requests
But...
Whatever

[Hook]
I switched my flows
I'm around
Curtains close
Don't make a sound
Smoke out the nose
L got me downed
Face in the pussy
I almost drowned

Fuck it up
Fuck it up
Keep it down
Turn it up
Play it loud

Fuck it up
Fuck it up
Keep it down
Turn it up
Play it loud
Hey

[Verse 1]
Shit tighter than a tight rope
Everything I write
Gets em hype tho
Snow White glow
On the mic hoe
Short shorts so her thighs show
And I go get it like Fido
It's all Ra Ra till the squad gone
And they all hate til the drive's on
And the right Jawn
Have em all on
My wave
And the feedback be on point
It's music till the grave
Me and rhythm be conjoined
Every song is worth the wait
Can't let em brake it up
*Bust it, Bust it*
Bust it down
Like ops
They be around
Under cover
Crafty motherfuckers
Lurking on the gram
Like damn
I must be the man
No keys for a push start
She Passenger seat with the head smarts
Tires spin as i depart
Let me break this down into 3 parts
Let me make it simple for you retards
Tell Mami i send my regards
Like Ha
I'm super duper nova like 3 stars
Destroy shit like glass jars
Or the windows in ya car
I'm a real man
Ya story telling ass be Babar
Throw backs be that hard
Copy the key
The shit has been made
Turn this shit up
U fucking wit jay
Bass too heavy
Can't hear what you say
Rake up what?
My shit on lock
Don't know if you real or not
They be mad like shades just stop
But i just turn my head and grab my cock
Run my shit back like a jock
Mixing beats around the clock
I'm seeing that you forgot
Fuego Gang we fucking hot
Gets shit popping like a 44 Glock
When i pull up in the parking lot
Get ya ricer shit out my parking spot
I rap in the Stu
But outside I don't talk a lot
Jay shady shades i won't stop till i hit the top
I'm gone

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
I'ma leave that pussy soaking
*Aye (x3)*
Bend it over bust it open
*Aye (x3)*
Rub her down with some lotion
*Yeah (x3)*
Get to quick with the motions
*Yeah, fuck it up*
Get her loud make commotions
Fuck it up (x2)
Aye

Oh

Aye
