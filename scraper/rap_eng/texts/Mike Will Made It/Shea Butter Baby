[Intro: Ari Lennox]
Ooh
Hold it, need it, need it, yeah
Shea butter baby, fuckin' up your pillow

[Verse 1: Ari Lennox]
Touch me, take me, kiss me
Love me, impress me
Pull up, black truck, ganja
Wrist so blinding, heart so timeless
Wishing, you could meet me, see me, read me

[Pre-Chorus: Ari Lennox & J. Cole]
You lost in the shape of my hips
Hope there is a mood
If you really down, we can find it
Lost in an alley, make love by a trash can, ayy (Oh, oh, oh, oh)
Hope there is a mood (Oh, oh, oh, oh)
And if you really down we can find it
Lost in an alley, make love by a trash can

[Chorus: Ari Lennox & J. Cole]
Shea butter baby, fuckin' up your pillow
Shea butter baby, fuckin' up your sheets
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)

[Verse 2: J. Cole]
You crossed my mind a thousand times
The cost was fine, I draw the line
I'm back, relapse, I'm fiending
Yes, what's that? In fact, I'm dreaming
Coconut oil, the scent of your body still lingers on sheets
I got a shot at you, you wouldn't reach
Cock back, cock back, trigger release
Pop that top, take a sip of your holiest water
I know I'm a part of your flow now
Said when you cut her, don't matter you love her
And now you got part of her soul, now
I ain't know then, but I know now
Apologies due, the one and the few
The ones I been through, but never loved you
I pray you found peace and you whole now
I'm doin' better, I got me a chocolate bar
Climbin' on top of the bar
Think of the shape, and I lick in the places you only gon' lick when you rock with her forever

[Pre-Chorus: Ari Lennox & J. Cole]
You lost in the shape of my hips
Hope there is a mood
And if you really down, we can find it
Lost in an alley, make love by a trash can, ayy (Oh, oh, oh, oh)
Hope there is a mood (Oh, oh, oh, oh)
And if you really down we can find it
Lost in an alley, make love

[Chorus: Ari Lennox & J. Cole]
Shea butter baby, fuckin' up your pillow
(I can get close to you baby, pull me closer, what are you about?)
Shea Butter baby, fuckin' up your sheets
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
(I can get close to you baby, pull me closer, what are you about?)
