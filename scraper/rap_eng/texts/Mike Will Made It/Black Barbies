[Intro: Nicki Minaj]
Mike WiLL Made-It, nigga
SremmLife
Black Barbies in the city
Fat ass and pretty titties
Get dummies for they money
You sent flowers but I wish I didn't receive ’em
All your lies I wish I didn't believe 'em

[Hook: Nicki Minaj]
That boy is a real pussy pleaser
All that fetty but he never met Masika
Tuck the chrome 22 in his sneaker
El Chapo but he crazy like La Quica
Young girls always lookin' for a soulmate
But I shoulda listened to what momma told me
Furry moon boots, shades Dita
Too high to give a shit about PETA

[Verse 1: Nicki Minaj]
Sativa so strong I'm not blinkin'
What in the world was I thinkin'?
New day, new money to be made
New things for them to imitate
I'm a fuckin' black barbie
Pretty face, perfect body
Pink seats in the 'Rari
Always fuck him like I'm sorry
Who the fuck is gon’ protect her?
If I really gotta check her
Peter Piper picked a pepper
And my cake is triple decker

[Interlude: Nicki Minaj]
No Flex Zone, No Flex Zone
(Yeah, oh no, no, no, no) No Flex Zone

[Verse 2: Nicki Minaj]
I see these silly nigga’s flexin', it’s a no zone
You gon' be floatin' in dem rivers like you know Joan
Island girl, Donald Trump want me go home
Still pull up with my wrist lookin' like a snowcone
She said she got a hit record, I said "Oooh shit!"
Picked up my phone cause I had to call "Bullshit!"
These bitches havin’ nightmares of my new shit
These bitches pussy and they don't ever do shit
Hahaha, get it? Douche-...hahahahahahaha
Half a mili on the Maybach Pullman, bought it
Now I'm prayin'  all my foreigns don't get deported
Niggas love me so much they be sendin' me gifts
And these clown niggas actin', I'mma send 'em some skits
Bitches can't rap for shit, I'mma send 'em some tips
All these bitches is my sons, should be suckin' my tits

[Interlude: Nicki Minaj]
(Yeah, oh no, no, no, no, yeah, oh no, no, no, no)

[Verse 3: Nicki Minaj]
Now usually I don't do this, I'm Popeye, she's Brutus
Usually I'm a Christian but this peace is Buddhist
All of my niggas draw but none of them Cartoonists
Usually I'm the baddest, usually I'm the cutest
Usually I'm the flyest, usually you're the stewardess
And we ain't playin' ball but usually its some shooters
Are these bitches drunk? These bitches ain't lucid
Go against the queen your career will be elusive
Where your plaques at? Where them stocks? Word to NASDAQ
Bitches ass-back, they was never in my tax-brack
(Yeah, oh no, no, no, no, yeah, oh no, no, no, no)

[Outro: Swae Lee]
That girl is a real crowd pleaser
Small world, all her friends know of me
Young bull living like an old geezer
Quick release the cash, watch it fall slowly
Frat girls still tryna get even
Haters mad for whatever reason
Smoke in the air, binge drinking
They lose it when the DJ drops the needle
