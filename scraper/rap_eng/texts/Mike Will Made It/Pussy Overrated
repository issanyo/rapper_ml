[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]
Yea I know what niggas tell you, you're finer than a mothafucker
Be on Instagram and on Vine like a mothafucker
Rich nigga get you, he don't ever put nothin' above you
Every time I see you, I don't ever want nothin' from you
Seen you in the club, actin' like somethin' wrong witcha
Ain't spendin' shit, so I prolly won't get along with you
Ain't one of them niggas, late night, stay on the phone witcha
I just wanna smoke the strong witcha but you're always trippin'

[Hook: Future]
I've been so many places and I've seen several faces
I told ya throw it back and stop, and then you hesitated
I knew you weren't gone take it, after you stripped naked
You're supposed to fuck me like a star, girl you know you're fakin'
(Your pussy overrated, your pussy overrated
Your pussy overrated, your pussy overrated, your pussy overrated)

[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]
Now why you keep askin' when you can hit the weed
When you know you should have one already rolled?
And why every time I get done doing my thing
I gotta see you backstage at my show?
I'm like woah!
Where you from, where you gone, who you came with?
And how many times you did the same shit?
I see you every other city we go
And every other video

(Your pussy overrated, your pussy overrated
Your pussy overrated, your pussy overrated, your pussy overrated)

[Bridge: Wiz Khalifa]
Might have showed a little love, but you can't say nothin' to me no more
Yea we got turned up but you can't say nothin' to me no more

[Verse 3: Wiz Khalifa]
Oh you must think you a star don't ya?
Wanna be front seat in my car don't ya?
Cristal from the bar, don't ya?
Oh you must think we'll go far don't ya?
Oh you must think I'll fall hard don't ya?
Don't you know I play my part, don't ya?

Your pussy overrated, your pussy overrated, your pussy overrated)

[Outro: Wiz Khalifa]
Every other city we go
And every other video
