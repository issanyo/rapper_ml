[Intro]
Mike WiLL Made-It
Gotti made it
No, I really really made it, for real
Ear Drummers

[Verse 1]
I'm just tryna build a legacy
Cocaine Musik, that's my legacy
I'm a savage, no finessin' me
I'm a savage, no finessin' me
I'm just tryna build a legacy
Got a whole lot of weaponry
Ten cars in my legacy, yeah
Took that Lambo to New York (skrrt)
Yeah, that was legendary
Let off shots at lil' buddy (brrrrr)
Yeah, that was necessary
I be strapped up every day (day)
Yeah, I ain't never worried (never)
All these niggas act like pussies (pussies)
I got more heart than February
Roc chain in my legacy
Talk to L.A. Reid on a trap phone (hello)
Ooh, I think I got the recipe (I do)
I can put the whole trap on
Free my nigga Kodak Black (lil' Kodak)
Tell them crackers gon' let the trap home
Free that nigga NBA YoungBoy
And I ain't never even met homes (one hundred)
Niggas tryna rep the set wrong (set wrong)
Watch a hater get shit on (uh)
I'm just tryna build my legacy (legacy)
It all started with the bricks home (bricks)
It all started with your bitch home (bitch)
It all started near your clique home (clique)
Mike WiLL made the beat
And this shit cost two bricks home

[Chorus]
My kicks are legendary
I'm legend (legend), legacy (legacy)
Legacy, fortune, fame, that shit ahead of me
I built a legacy
Pots, pans, kitchen, regularly
I built a legacy
Money, lawyers, cases, fire
They all felonies

[Verse 2]
I be still bumpin' Trap or Die from Jeezy (Trap or Die)
I be still bumpin' Carter One from Weezy (Carter 5)
I be still on that 2Pac and that Biggie shit (I am)
They like Gotti need to calm down, boy you big as shit (I am, I know I am)
MC Murda still my fuckin' favorite rapper (ride for my niggas)
And Big Meech still my fuckin' favorite trapper (trap for my niggas)
And your bitch just want me to come through, kidnap her (skrrt, kidnap her)
If she got the best of me (best of me), she part of my legacy

[Chorus]
And that pussy legendary
I'm legend (legend), legacy (legacy)
Legacy, fortune, fame, that shit ahead of me
I built a legacy
Pots, pans, kitchen, regularly
I built a legacy
Money, lawyers, cases, fire
They all felonies
