[Hook]
This is that real shit, building up real shit
Picking peppers, for Peter, pipe her, pen shit
Pimping, and simplistic pickings, pick apart the pit
Or pick a lock, and key him, oh God!
Ya'll slipping, like you not appealing
Ready for the killing, ready for the millions
Ready for the fillings, like I'm at a dentist
I be making noise, like onomatopoeia

[Verse]
Like it's never been about that
Should I really announce that?
I've been skilled, since I left out my fathers nut sack
Real shit but pause, I be getting rap niggas upset
Cause I'm the youngest nigga, doing no set
A nigga be silent, I'm a no say
But I'm bout to show niggas, that I murked rap
Give a fuck bout a enemy
Only care bout my inner me
Giving remedies, I'm a entity
I use the good in me, but when a nigga
Get a little bit pissed, then I might have to aim my pistols
Up entering, I might aim with a 3 just like I'm reading Leviticus
Got a bitch that Dominican, and the pussy I'm ending it
When the asshole is in the building, you know that I'm killing it
When I'm in the business, I'm a killing ya many man
Ya'll are mouses, fuck ya spouses, I'm a mormon
Need 4 houses, fuck allowance, if I need money
I get it, I guess I'm just money couching
I'm immortalized, real like them older guys
Shout out, to Nas, and Big Daddy Kane
Not to mention Raekwon, them niggas rapped at face
3 OG's in one, Puff, Big, and Mase
I don't wan't another nigga try to rap fast
And if anybody do, they getting back slashed
All these niggas they goin talk but pause and back down
Get back up, and they will go back down
And my flow echo like surround sound, ok
Niggas near me with they bars, say they rap at heart
But to me that be noise hoe, I call that surround sounds
I don't point fingers but I'm appointed
This smoke in my bones, I'd say it's jointed
I want every dead bolt rapper to rest in peace
Need to focus on these bars, with they ADHD
I'm running the beat ya see, I cut the piece
With the peace, piece of me, and peace
All black, push ya melon in, niggas gonna bite
The apple that Adam and Eve bit in
But that's different sin
2 times the liking of these apples
I gotta pair em out, ya'll cats be outta oxygen
That shit's approximate, I guess my punches aired it out
Got so many dreams, I have 4 bank accounts
Cause of my parents, and if I don't prove
That I got success, then I guess I'm a be more broke than you
And that's just something that I will regret, f the world!
