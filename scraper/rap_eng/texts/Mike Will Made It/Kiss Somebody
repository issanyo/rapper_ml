[Verse 1]
Turn off all the lights and I can see you in the dark
Maybe not with eyes but I can sense you with my heart
The fact that they don't understand us is my favorite part
I hope the world can hear me when I say

[Chorus]
You just gotta kiss somebody, just kiss somebody
Kiss somebody, just kiss somebody, babe
Accept your obsessions and learn all the lessons of your heart
You just gotta kiss somebody, just kiss somebody
Kiss somebody, just kiss somebody
Turn your aggression into a blessing, play your part, yeah

[Verse 2]
I don't, I don't ever have to know what lonely is
Baby, baby, I remember when you told me this
Told me, told me that you love me and you showed me it
They won't ever, ever know it

[Chorus]
Only if you kiss somebody, just kiss somebody
Kiss somebody, just kiss somebody
Kiss somebody, just kiss somebody
Kiss somebody, babe, yeah, yeah
