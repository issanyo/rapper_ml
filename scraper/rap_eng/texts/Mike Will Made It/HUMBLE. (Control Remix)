Alright let’s do this shit man
It’s time to get hype
Whooo
Yeah! Yeah!

[Verse 1]
You can keep on talking shit, because you think that youre the best
But I'm breaking all your backs, when i come on the attack
All my motherfucking rhymes are gonna rip your chest
Taught myself rap, and look at me now
Man, Im Spraying out bars, and I dont know how
Supersonic flow and I won't slow down
And, You had your shot, but i just called foul
Lyrics razor sharp, man just the thought gives you a major cut
Burning up some bitches bout to torch the fucking fakers up
People keep on dissing me, do I look like a give a fuck
Guarantee it won't be long before theyre running outta luck
So when I’m stepping on the track you know I’m staying lyrical
I go on the attack and they be calling me a miracle
My flows are staying frozen while I'm dunking like DeRozan
I be hanging with the pros and all these other brothers knowing
That I'm Changing up the formula but never change the plan
Making rhymes all the time while im getting all the fans
Making bands in the pans in American lands
That's the dream that I planned and I know you understand

My OneTake just went viral!

I'm Slow and steady but I'm sitting on a high note
Humbled by the people helping me to rise though
I'm Gonna go and make it I know, but Bitch be Humble

[Hook]
Sit down, be humble
Sit down, be humble
Sit down, be humble
Sit down, be humble
Sit down, be humble
Sit down, be humble
Sit down, be humble
Sit down

[Verse 2]
I'm Cruising down the street, i make impressions when I'm gazing man
Amazing phasing, tasing lazy daisies, bitch im raising grands
Abusing bruising, losers, that be using cuz i hate them man
I'm Breaking all the faking, like the Drake and then awaken fans
Stitching up the snitches, ill be making an example
Educated bars, did you bitches want a sample?
Looking for alliteration bitch I've got a handful
Billing big bad bimbos, boy I'm building up the bands fool
Aye, my flows way too crazy (ay)
Bitch Your hate don't faze me (ay)
See the haze I'm making (ay)
See the records breaking (ay)
See the shit I'm staking (ay)
You don't see me faking (ay)
Got these people waking (ay)
Give but I don't take it (ay)
I don't have to flex it (ay)
You know i perfect it (ay)
I think I'm the greatest (ay)
Stupid when you say this ay)
Better Wipe that smirk off (ay)
Ill burn you like some Smirnoff (ay)
Just to make sure you dont' crumble, go on home and you stay humble

[Hook]
Sit down, be humble
Sit down, be humble
Sit down, be humble
Sit down, be humble
Sit down, be humble
Sit down, be humble
Sit down, be humble
Sit down, be humble
