[Intro]
Today will be the day when
It will be the utltimate change up
Your life will sway
30, you a fool for this one
Things will happen that you can't explain
Mike WiLL Made-It
Faded I cut off my loose ends (Are you ready?)
Allow it to follow the heart (You better be)
Promise that I’ll make you a part (The world just  gon' keep spinning)
Mike WiLL Made-It

[Chorus: Eearz]
Faded I cut off my loose ends
Allow it to follow the heart
Promise that I’ll make you a part
Left side of my chest went dark
Take another sip, watch the room spin
Emotions are all under lock
All of my emotions unlocked
All of my emotions unlocked

[Verse 1: Eearz]
Spendin' my day, smokin' my weed and reflectin', countin' my blessings
Stressin' 'cause havin' enough to me is really just settlin' and I want it better
I admit shit is gettin' better but difference between wantin' now and havin' forever
Tryna figure all this shit out
No, I'm not pickin' up the phone off and
Our communications seem on and off and
I'm just gettin' shit together, nobody understand though
To be selfish with myself so I can help somebody else
That's that part of me, give it out, I could be immaculately honestly this prophecy, uh
No apologies, I'm givin' 'em everthin' over the sun
It's a thin line, can pop it off, ain't never cross none
I'm walkin' straight to my goons better, no one got to die
Please don't play me for a yellow belly, cold still carry
Everythin' I see is real, so if you real, I know you smell me
All for the love of what we could be, please

[Chorus: Eearz]
Faded I cut off my loose ends
Allow it to follow the heart
Promise that I’ll make you a part
Left side of my chest went dark
Take another sip, watch the room spin
Emotions are all under lock
All of my emotions unlocked
All of my emotions unlocked

[Verse 2: Eearz]
Now now my nigga, tell me how you feelin'
Wakin' up everyday and you tryna get that bag for your family and your children's children
You start to tell when people plot and got new intentions
You wanna be the man of the top floor of that buildin', listen
I'm 'bout to speak out these schematics, draw your ass a blueprint
Then you grew up, so wild and ruthless, can't just be a nuisance
You gotta hold it down and start regroupin'
You better buckle down and get your two [?]
Get your grip on life, can't loosen
Let's act like you know better, they ain't give no handouts, so finna hold out my hands
Humble up, stand down
And and soak up all this knowledge that I'm pukin', just student of the game
See what I'm learnin', push my bros to the same
My body's gone, yet these words still remain
I hope a struck a cord of change or at least part the brain
So maybe this is what we all needed
The one that made it right up out the streets
And showed us how to get up on our feet, preach

[Chorus: Eearz]
Faded I cut off my loose ends
Allow it to follow the heart (it's the streets, it's the streets)
Promise that I’ll make you a part
Left side of my chest went dark
Take another sip, watch the room spin
Emotions are all under lock
All of my emotions unlocked
All of my emotions unlocked

[Outro: Eearz]
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Tryna get down
[??] shit
It's like a nigga [??] what's gon' happen next
[??] pray and pray
Earz to the streets  Earz to the streets
Earz to the streets  Earz to the streets
Earz to the streets  Earz to the streets
