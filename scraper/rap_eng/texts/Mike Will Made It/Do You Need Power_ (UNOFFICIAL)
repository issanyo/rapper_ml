[Bon Iver]
Talk back, talk back with 'em
With your full rebound
I ain't nothing with such cautious time
The buzzards all over now
It all ain't nothing if you don't survive
Do I need power?
Do you need power?

[Capo Dim]
Started from a youngin
In the hood villain always be
This is what i is, this is me
What else can i be
Ain't shit else to be, but be me
This is what i be, buzzing where i bee
You can tell me if you disagree
But fuck it dawg fuck you dog
Fuck this shit and fuck a hug
I don't need it you can keep it
Ive been through it like a bandit
Bitch i mean it, bugs moran it
So you fucking understand it
Do you need flower or
Do you need, do you need
Do you need power?
