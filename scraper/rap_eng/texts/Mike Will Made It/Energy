[Verse 1: Tinashe]
I've been playing so shy
You've been running the game
Said I've been stuck on your mind
Baby, don't play
We love Saturday nights
Where they're making it rain
In the deep of the night
Storm is coming my way

[Pre-Chorus: Tinashe]
Hit me up, ready to roll
Still early out, we're still good to go
Feeling right, I'm feeling right
Come here tonight, come here tonight

[Chorus: Tinashe]
Baby, hit me like lightning
Feel my body flowing into me
Gonna feel it inside me
Light me up, you give me energy

[Post-Chorus: Tinashe]
I'm feeling right, come here tonight
I'm feeling right, come here tonight
I'm feeling right, come here tonight
I'm feeling right, come here tonight

[Verse 2: Tinashe]
Let your mind fly
Taking this shit how I like
It's been a sweet, sweet life
Gonna never let you go
Never wanna see you cry
Never gonna say goodbye
I'll never believe a thing you say
But you know I like it anyway

[Pre-Chorus: Tinashe]
Hit me up, ready to roll
Still early out, we're still good to go
Feeling right, I'm feeling right
Come here tonight, come here tonight

[Chorus: Tinashe]
Baby, hit me like lightning
Feel my body flowing into me
Gonna feel it inside me
Light me up, you give me energy

[Post-Chorus: Tinashe]
I'm feeling right, come here tonight
I'm feeling right, come here tonight
I'm feeling right, come here tonight
I'm feeling right, come here tonight

[Verse 3: Juicy J]
She showed up in a trench coat
With nothing on underneath that
I cut her up like a chainsaw
And lay that wood like a lumberjack
That grade A, keep you coming back
She 'bout that action, didn't come to chat
When the lights go out, we go back to back
Sweating like we've been running laps
We doing jumping jacks, we doing yoga
She exercise, she eat yogurt
She read books and watch Oprah
I let her ride me, I'm her chauffeur
She wine fine, she classy
She rock designer clothes, drive foreign cars
My private movie star
She put on a show and we record it all
And ain't nobody gotta know our business
Tell them haters go mind they own
We stay shining on 'em, no rhinestone
We ride private jets and switch timezones
Your friends jealous, don't get it twisted
Ain't no secret, they in their feelings
But I bet they'd give up both kidneys
If they could be in your position

[Pre-Chorus: Tinashe]
Hit me up, ready to roll
Still early out, we're still good to go
Feeling right, I'm feeling right
Come here tonight, come here tonight

[Chorus: Tinashe]
Baby, hit me like lightning
Feel my body flowing into me
Gonna feel it inside me
Light me up, you give me energy

[Post-Chorus: Tinashe]
I'm feeling right, come here tonight
I'm feeling right, come here tonight
I'm feeling right, come here tonight
I'm feeling right, come here tonight
