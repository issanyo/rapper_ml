(Hook: Darius Brown)
We got the hoes

All my niggas know
All my niggas know (repeat)

(Interlude: MGKGod11)
Bro hold up let me go. let me go

[Verse 1: MGKGod11)
All my niggas know what I do everyday
I be mixing up the dough and I also play in that clay
I can pull four hoes up in the sand
Every-single day I'm making that band
New raps, new moment
I have a new fan
All my friends cook up the pot in a can
We like Migos, but a better band
I don't know what the fuck I'm thinking about
Cuz I'm the man, i'm the man, I'm the man
Fuck with me your in a trans

[Verse 2: Lud Shawty Zone 3]
Ya'll some haters
Ya'll some haters
Cuz I'm beating that pussy like craters
I'm like BJ Rhymes
I keep all my niggas all up in a fine
We know how we working
She know how she twerking
I will throw up them bandz and tell her to keep it working
I fucked is momma in my van
And the whole night I was the man
What you mean? she a can?
Ho. what you mean she a can

(Hook: Darius Brown)
We got the hoes

All my niggas know

[Verse 3: Michael Johanson]
I'm mixing up the sauces
I'm all up in a race
I'm never double-crossing
I will blow a hundred K in your face
I've been eating pussy almost everyday
You know how this is I'm always in a race
Find a pace
Or find case
I get some cake
Throw it in yo face
I'm the nigga with the taste
Big ass and big titties
Flat stomach
I ain't fucking with no biggy

[Verse 4:Darius Brown]
Glocc 47
Clock 47
I don't ever stop it, I keep it 24/7
I'm in heaven
I'm not Rnb
All I drink is that tea
All this gold on me my nigga
I can't get through any scene

(Hook: Darius Brown)
We got the hoes
We got the shows
All my niggas know
All my niggas know (repeat)
