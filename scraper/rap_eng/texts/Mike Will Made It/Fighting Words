[Verse 1: T.I.]
I'm a young nigga in an old school
I got new money and an old 'tude
O.G.'s salute when I roll through
Fuck niggas ain't beef, they tofu
I'm so cool, got a crew of ho's
In nobu eating sushi rolls
Right after that, we headed back
To the condo where they eat kuchi hole
I'm stupid ho. Run through the ho
You dream about it, I do it, ho
Ass fat, face beautiful
Throw 'em a sack of twenties
They good to go
Niggas don't fear me, they should though
And they can't hear me, they would though
If they was up on my plateau, but I'm wacko
Bet that ho

[Hook: T.I.]
What you talking bout ho

What you talking bout ho
Who you talking to, nigga
Bitch nigga, pump ho, pump ho
Bitch nigga, pump ho, pump ho
What you talking bout ho
Who you talking to, nigga
What you talking bout ho
Who you talking to, nigga
Bitch nigga, pump ho, pump ho
Bitch nigga, pump ho, pump ho
You don’t like me nigga hit me in my face then
Got a problem when you see me nigga, say it then
Bitch nigga, pump ho, pump ho
Bitch nigga, pump ho, pump ho

[Verse 2: Juicy J]
Got a rocket in the club and ain’t afraid to pop it
Nigga run your lips I put that barrel to your sockets
Haters out here hating cause that flexing never stopping
Keep that blue dream in my bomb and the hash for the toppings
That niggas all stay on me, so homie don’t play with me
I keep them bills, I keep that lean, I keep a ak with me
A real street nigga, catch me in the streets nigga
Got something to hit your chest hard
And I ain’t talking liquor
Don’t need no nigga fuck rapping
Nigga talk that shit I’m blasting
That .44 to your face bitch, it’s gonna be a closed casket
Your whole life is a storyline
You ain’t gangsters, you niggas lie
Make massacres like the valentine
Turn this club into the columbine

[Hook:T.I.]

[Verse 3:Trae Tha Truth]
Get the fuck out in this building
Ass hole, fuck what you feeling
Feel the 48 my wrist cause I’m killing
Pety nigga run they mouth and I’m stealing
Then I hurry a couple of niggas feel it
When I jump out the ...but no ceiling
With a bitch in the back on that fuck shit
I beat it up you can tell it wouldn’t heal it
You don’t like me, what the fuck is you talking
You can ...bitch it’s whatever
I don’t give a fuck you won’t get it together

All on a nigga ass like a nigga who tripping

Get the whole pot and get out the fuck my way
... got a couple niggas that will...bitch I got you
