[Verse 1]
Yeah
Now-a-days, these bitches be tellin' me, "All you need is money, fame"
Sign a pact with devil, as you know, it will take away your pain
All they ever say is, "Gettin' money & the bitches"
I keep listenin' in that
So my brain said, "Fuckin' chase it"
It's 2017, they still racist
Time to face it, I'm gon' say it
Try to stop it, pull the trigger, I say, "Fuck it"
I ain't lyin', people dyin'
What you think these leaders doing on it?
All they ever want is one world order and do hidden crimes
Have to get the money, have to get the bitches
Otherwise, you just a piece of shit
Have to pay the bills, see your momma cryin'
Broke as fuck got me feelin' like I'm dyin'
You ain't got that, you ain't got this
All they ever say is, "Where the money is?"
All these fuckin' questions got me really pissed
I don't have a choice
Fuckin' signed the deal
Now I'm gettin' money
Now I'm gettin' cheddar
Now these bitches love me
Now they wanna fuck me
Now I got the shows
Now I got the hoes
Chillin' with my dawg
Drug overdose
Now my momma proud
Now I got the foes
Now they takin' pictures
'Cause I'm the fuckin' fad
Now I'm gettin' all the things I never had
Now I'm rappin' but they never call me mad
Why? 'Cause I got the money now
Why? 'Cause I got the bitches now
Why? 'Cause I got the cars now
Why? 'Cause I got famous now
Yeah, apparently every each one of us want money and the mafuckin' fame
It's this culture, this occult that's been stoppin' us from thinkin' 'bout the other things
Bitch, I don't want that fake shit like you do
So fuck you
And they say that money is the root of all evil
But bitch, we love money, the more we love people
If you rich than you big
But if you poor, you ain't equal
Gotta get flyer than Knievel
So we gotta get rich, don't give a fuck about the people
Yeah
But I ain't fake like this, got realest shit up in my DNA
They keep sayin' shit, I'm dreamin' big, I'll make it to the VMAs
I got that hustle adroit maneuver in my DNA, bitch

[Bridge]
5, 4, 3, 2, 1
Yeah
Let's get this shit done
Uh

[Verse 2]
I'm thinkin' 'bout money and bitches like 24/7
I can't get it off my mind
I'm cursed, I'm lyin'
I'm smokin' that pine
I feel like I'm blind
I must have to find
A way to get outta this shit
Sold my soul just to get all of this shit
But why am I not satisfied?
Why I feel like my body ain't alive?
Why these demons keep me wakin' up at every night?
It's not a normal fight
It's like me vs Skulls and Bones, Bohemian Grove, Rockefeller, Bilderberg, CIA
These motherfuckers knew about 9/11
They still givin' weapon
They still makin' terror
And they blamin' Muslims
Where they the main reasons
Bring 'em outta prison
Stop takin lives
We ain't scared to fight
We done gave lives for this motherfuckin' independence, we ain't independent still
One day I'll be on the bed with 8 motherfuckin' record deals
What you know about that
Sex, money, murder in our DNA
We the brainwashed homo sapiens
Just to let you know, the end is really near
Just to let you know, the end is really near
Yeah, the end is really near, bitch
I swear
