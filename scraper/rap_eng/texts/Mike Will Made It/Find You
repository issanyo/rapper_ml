(Bridge: Trevor Jackson)
You can try to look in my mind
You won't ever see what I see
Your blind
I got a problem with you
Everyday when you ain't around me
I'm just a problem killer
Let me tell you what I'm on

(Chorus: Trevor Jackson)
I be on another level
On another level
I be on another level
On another level
You ain't gone find me
Watch me take it to another level (find you)
Yo I sware  I tried to tell her

(Hook 2: Yamine)
I stay up in the freaking trap
You know that I can rap
I keep my prices up high and I know that for a fact
Everytime I look at you I get embarrassed
I Single out some white chicks
[?]
She don't know what she want to do
I'm doing everything for you
I go 24/7 for [?]
I throw them dueces up
Cuz I don't give a fuck
I'm up in the club
Forget the drugs
I worry about the pussy and worry about the love
Short hair, I don't care
Your name starts with a B
It's really me
You know who I'm talking about
Yeah aww!


(Bridge: Trevor Jackson)
You can try to look in my mind
You won't ever see what I see
Your blind
I got a problem with you
Everyday when you ain't around me
I'm just a problem killer
Let me tell you what I'm on

(Chorus: Trevor Jackson)
I be on another level
On another level
I be on another level
On another level
You ain't gone find me
Watch me take it to another level (find you)
Yo I sware  I tried to tell her
