[Verse 1: Rico Pressley]
I don't give a fuck man, I promise, I promise
I look at your bitch and that bitch looking Amish
I promised myself that I wouldn't go to college
I don't give a fuck man, I don't need no knowledge
I'm sipping that brew nigga, I'm alcoholic
Foreign lil bitch with me, she looking flawless
She suck on my dick and she left that shit polished
And all this damn money, it chill in my wallet
I'm balling, I'm balling like Ali, huh
Slam your girl home like I'm Wallace, huh
I got the cheese, no cottage, huh
The tats on my arm are symbolic, huh
Stay with two niggas, they solid, huh
Car full of bitches, it's haulin'
Car full of bitches, it's haulin'
Car full of bitches, it's haulin', huh
I only fuck bitches with clout

What goes around comes back around
What goes around comes back around
Yeah, what goes around comes back around
I only fuck bitches with clout
I only fuck bitches with clout

[Verse 2: Swae Lee]
Hugo sittin' on my shoes, yeah
Find a frisk, not no Trues (yeah)
That bitch she wasn't ran through, yeah
I took that bitch on a cruise (hey)
Them niggas is mad, I'm like woo-sah
They stealing swag, I'ma sue ya
My bitch is not Betty Boop
Shaking that body just like hula hoop
I cannot make no excuse
I'm balling out like a new recruit
Dominate in a used coupe
But the sedan is brand new
Ear Drummers, that is my crew
Yeah, they already know what we do
Can't chase run around Sue
Can't chase run around Sue
Say he got it but when it's time to spend
Something just doesn't compute
Baby I'm high, high, high and I got a good view
What's on the menu, that girl'll be havin' the crew

[Chorus: Rico Pressley]
I'm like baby, what's the move, yeah
I'm like baby, what's the move
Pull up like, what it do, yeah
