[Intro: Blac Youngsta]
Pill popper, pills
Pill popper, pop, seals

[Chorus: Blac Youngsta]
Lean molly water, Perc pill popper
Pull up at Follies on pill, pill, pills (pop!)
I'm on that drank, red and yellow
Rest in peace Pimp C, pop seal, seal, seals (pop!)
You ain't bout that action, you ain't no gangsta
You ain't never been in the field, field, fields
Nigga you a rat, if the laws come and get you right now
Nigga you'll squeal, squeal, squeal (pop!)
You ain't lost shit, you ain't got it out the dirt, lil nigga
You don't know how I feel, feel, feel (pop!)
I'm on that Henny, I'm on that X
I'ma fuck yo bitch out her heel, heel, heels (pop!)
Pill popper (pop!) seal popper (whoa!)
Run up (pop!) he'll pop you (pop!)
She suck my dick in my flip-flops (pop!)
I do not fuck with no hip-hopper (rappers!)

[Verse 1: Blac Youngsta]
Ho I'm a dog, bitch I don't text
'Cause I can't spell everything I wanna say
I don't know your name cause I fuck new bitches everyday
Ho, I don't remember your face
Identify yourself
I can't go to sleep unless my pistol on the shelf
I can't fuck that bitch 'less I got a rubber on
All these Percs got me feelin' on myself
All this work, ain't shit for the low
Hell nah nigga I ain't givin' no deals
Shoot the weedman if the dope ain't smokin'
Playin with my drank, this shit ain't sealed (pop, gang!)
Seal popper (gang!)
Most of you rappers just shit-talkers (gang!)
I'll fuck around, shoot your lip off ya (gang!)
Run up (gang!) he'll pop you (bang!)

[Chorus: Blac Youngsta]
Lean molly water, Perc pill popper
Pull up at Follies on pill, pill, pills (pop!)
I'm on that drank, red and yellow
Rest in peace Pimp C, pop seal, seal, seals (pop!)
You ain't bout that action, you ain't no gangsta
You ain't never been in the field, field, fields
Nigga you a rat, if the laws come and get you right now
Nigga you'll squeal, squeal, squeal (pop!)
You ain't lost shit, you ain't got it out the dirt, lil nigga
You don't know how I feel, feel, feel (pop!)
I'm on that Henny, I'm on that X
I'ma fuck yo bitch out her heel, heel, heels (pop!)
Pill popper (pop!) seal popper (whoa!)
Run up (pop!) he'll pop you (pop!)
She suck my dick in my flip-flops (pop!)
I do not fuck with no Hip-Hopper (rappers!)

[Verse 2: Lil Yachty]
Lil Boat!
Yeah, right wrist (huh) in the air (huh)
Ride around (huh) through Bel-Air (whoa)
Bitch, I don't fuck with no welfare hoes
Yo baby daddy broke, he eat Cheerios
I'm a record-breaker
New whip with no CD player
Fuck niggas can't talk to me
Old whips can't park near me, huh
Pop shit (yep!) flood wrist (skrrt!)
Red whips (ho!) take trips (bitch!)
Molly got the lil ho doing backflips
Model lil bitch lookin' just like a Q-tip
Skinny, but she might cost you a penny
All of these bitches be mouses like Minnie
Not many niggas hangin' 'round me that's real, real, deal
Most of these niggas gon' squeal on God

[Chorus: Blac Youngsta]
Lean molly water, Perc pill popper
Pull up at Follies on pill, pill, pills (pop!)
I'm on that drank, red and yellow
Rest in peace Pimp C, pop seal, seal, seals (pop!)
You ain't bout that action, you ain't no gangsta
You ain't never been in the field, field, fields
Nigga you a rat, if the laws come and get you right now
Nigga you'll squeal, squeal, squeal (pop!)
You ain't lost shit, you ain't got it out the dirt, lil nigga
You don't know how I feel, feel, feel (pop!)
I'm on that Henny, I'm on that X
I'ma fuck yo bitch out her heel, heel, heels (pop!)
Pill popper (pop!) seal popper (whoa!)
Run up (pop!) he'll pop you (pop!)
She suck my dick in my flip-flops (pop!)
I do not fuck with no hip-hopper (rappers!)

[Outro: Blac Youngsta]
Pill popper, pills
Pill popper, pop, seals
