[Intro]
Jacuzzi, Mike Will Made It
Lafleur, word
Don't be shy when them cameras come out
Fuck around make a story

[Chorus]
Hair, hair like Pocahontas, dancin’ like nobody’s watchin’
Shake that ass for papi, pop it like nobody’s watchin’
Party at my crib until the neighbors stop it
For now, we dancin’ like nobody’s watchin’
Hair like Pocahontas, dancin’ like nobody’s watchin’
Shake that ass for papi, pop it like nobody’s watchin’
Party at my crib until the neighbors stop it
For now, we dancin’ like nobody’s watchin’

[Verse 1]
I’m a dog off the leash; I bring sand to the beach
I bite off more than I can chew, cause all my niggas gotta eat
Lil mama got a G-string on with a booty so big
Put a song  she gon turn into a stripper
If your girl tryna smoke, I got something she can roll
Not me, I just need a little liquor, oh
Baby I’m gone for the summer, oh
I might just pull up in the Hummer, yo
You know Jacuzzi been the underdog
And I still keep my money in my box of jars
My bitch don’t know how to sing, but she been rocking Celine
Step out the store in Dior, covered in bling
I feel like Wayne, I dare you to blink
I’m so in love on my drink
Look at my chains, all covered in pink

[Chorus]
Hair like Pocahontas, dancin’ like nobody’s watchin’
Shake that ass for papi, pop it like nobody’s watchin’
Party at my crib until the neighbors stop it
For now, we dancin’ like nobody’s watchin’
Hair like Pocahontas, dancin’ like nobody’s watchin’
Shake that ass for papi, pop it like nobody’s watchin’
Party at my crib until the neighbors stop it
For now, we dancin’ like nobody’s watchin’

[Verse 2]
Throw it back don’t hurt me, throw it back don’t hurt me, ya ya
You throw it back so perfect, you gon’ bring it back by twerkin’
The Henny got the niggas friggin cursin’
Now, I ain't saying you got a nigga nervous
But finna turn the strip club into a circus
Shake it for me like you do behind them curtains
You gon Snapchat that in the club with your hoes
Out in v live where niggas get throwed
We gon make plans when you’re done with the pole
At my crib, got a call, what’s that? No clothes
Baby got a cake, she gon make it shake
All these baddies with no panties in my crib, I gotta set em straight

[Chorus]
Hair like Pocahontas, dancin’ like nobody’s watchin’
Shake that ass for pappy, pop it like nobody’s watchin’
Party at my crib until the neighbors stop it
Hair like Pocahontas, dancin’ like nobody’s watchin’
Shake that ass for pappy, pop it like nobody’s watchin’
Party at my crib until the neighbors stop it
