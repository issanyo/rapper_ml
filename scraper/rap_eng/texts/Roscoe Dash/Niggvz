The rumors go out like a policy

Bitches 69 in front of me

I got n****s I don’t want to see
Honestly I got jersey’s hanging 10 yrs
That is worth the plan
When n****s with silent jerseys waiting when

So murder infatuating
So now how much murder in front your face

Aim like came like you can bring that shit back

[Verse 3]
I’m smokin' purple
I’m sipping purple
Use to pray for times like this
Patients a virtue
You know who you fucking with
No don’t act confused
You can never be this biff
Can’t take this shoes
I never see these n****s snoring
This shit gets boring
I might just hop off this tour and
Pull up like door man
My new bitch she is alluring
Just looking foreign
Who the hell you think she with
When she ignoring
She will be spiffing
She exploring
Receiving blessings
With the jelling in my time
Feeling like I learn my lesson
Hey they see me come home
I put weight on me
Who I think they going to hate on me
My n***a I’m living your daddy dream
My blunt in my cup they have gasoline
