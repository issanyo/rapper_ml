Verse 1:
Str8 out mf perry
Shooting like Brent Barry
They through the this was over done with
Now the situations getting scary
All my real niggas next to me
Dolos never been the recipe
But if them bitches sitting funny
Man U know I cut em just like a misectemi
Less is free
But for the best of me
I need everything
I every dreamt for me
Reciprocation like a lift to me
If the ratings bad it wasn't meant for me
I got family ties

Ain't no dandelion when it's planting time
Dis lil friend of mine
Got a temper I ain't really
But u know I hit for mine
Apologies apologies
Save that for your following
All ya bad bitches swallowing
Cuz u gon have to explain
This lil outline from the chalk thing
Writing checks u can't cash is costly
When it really never was a cost thing
This the greenest light since Boston

My body boughta stiff up
All this jibbering jabbering
When somebody gon give this shit up

Someone stop me
It's highway robbery
I'm living Godly
Sad true and oddly
The glitter didn't stop me
The goat
I been under cloak
I been under oath
Fuck around
I might eat ya slow
Then eat ya coat
Under normal circumstances
It'd go just like u planned it
But the real is back
Like a heart attack
Consistently causing damage
Fuck all that back n forth

The young phenom they couldn't stand it
Do it left hand landis
