Lord knows I ain't perfect
Lord knows I ain't perfect
Lord knows I ain't perfect
Lord knows I ain't perfect
But im close ah
Perfect for me, perfect for her, perfect for we
Perfect ain't perfect to em cuz niggas ain't me
I been searching my whole life but i finally see
Nobody got me the way
I got me so shout out to me!
Oooh whats up?

[Verse 1]
I been putting in that work (Work)
So everything look same to me
I dont drive around chauffeur (chauffeur)
Really dont know bakery
I been running, running awww (money)
Money be chasing me
Hit after hit
Like I played for major leagues
Dont play with me
Ahaahhaaa
Begging is something I never did
Even if I fell off
I left the game with several kids
Mini me's
The way they walk or talk, yeah thats plenty me
They carry on for centuries
No way they never gonna get rid of me
Ohh memories
Who taught these folks how to turn ups they learn us then burn us
I get all of my love
But because they learn us
Thts why this time around
(this time around)
Naaa naaa this time around
I'ma wake up next to my senses

Perfect for me, perfect for her, perfect for we
Perfect ain't perfect to em cuz niggas ain't me

Oooh whats up?

[Verse 2]
Money dun got to me, women on top of me
Came way along of my partery
Got to be lottery, look how dem dollars be
Falling in power look as tall as me
Making a sandwich of monocheese
Gotta watch out for em rats
Cuz the rats gonna rattle and rats gonna pass em
You got to pay homage to that
Thats why Im rich then a bitch, like a nigga selling bricks
I can't give a hoes some time
But I can give that hoe the dick
I been living on my bag
Cuz a nigga wanna trip
Couple nigga like spandex
But talking wreakless by the click
Ok thts (?)
Office top less ciroc
No question no nuttin in the maufucker blessing in the mug no coffee pie
I m the maker I m the maker
I m the coach I m the player
No thats thats relevant to irrelevant
(?) to these motherfucking elephant
