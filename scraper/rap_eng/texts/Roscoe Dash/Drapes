Pussy got me slidin’
Like a new pair of skates
Head so fire brought her shoes
And the wraith
I'm working to the T
It got me comin home at 8
Water so good
I can drink it from the lake
She in a lace
Got me straight
Just wanna taste
Don't wanna wait
I say my grace
She sit it on my face
Don't need a plate
I spread her like some Drapes

Get her out them draws
Push her to the limits
Fucking way too hard
I might catch a sentence
Broke that pussy down
Like a stage when I'm finished
Hit from long range
Like a Range when I’m in it
I'ma donate...eat her like steak
Throw the rod, bait
I might fish fillet
She put the water on me
I might rinse away
Cloudin’ up the room
She precipitate

Don’t panic
We make a Scoe Sandwich
She deserves some Jacksons to her name like Janet
She gonna bring her frnd too
We gonna both plan it
It ain’t no damage
We get so savage
Yeah Too much ain't too much
We Netflix and chill
We don't do much I got her takin shots
Got her too clutch
Bought her a headband and a new (?)

Pussy got me slidin’

Got me straight
Just wanna taste
Don't wanna wait
I say my grace
