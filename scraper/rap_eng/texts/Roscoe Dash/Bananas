[Intro: Strap]
I go banana-nana-nana, I go crazy crazy crazy
Crazy, crazy, crazy, stupid, stupid, stupid

[Hook: Strap & Roscoe Dash 2.0]
I go banana-nana-nana, I go crazy, crazy, crazy
I go stupid, stupid, stupid, yay, yay, yay, yay
If you know you turnt up, say: "yay, yay, yay"
If you know you turnt up, say: "yay, yay, yay"
I'm so turned up right now, stuck, but I can't turn down
I'm so turned up right now, stuck, but I can't turn down
I'm so turned up right now, stuck, but I can't turn down
I'm so turned up right now, stuck, but I can't turn down

[Verse 1: Ali]
Crazy, crazy turkey, ham, banana
My life is very crazy, I am something you can't handle
You don't like what you seeing? I suggest you change the channel
And for you thirsty hoes, here's a dollar, buy a Fanta
Or buy a Tropicana, she told me watch my manners
I think that I'm the shit, I need to go buy me some Pampers
I'm all the way in Savannah with this girl I call Diana
I hit it from the back and then Ali just went bananas
But shawty keep on texting me, molesting me, why is she harassing me?
And asking me, 'Why are you so crazy, crazy, crazy'?
I don't know why I'm so crazy, man, I got a stomach-achey
In the morning, eggs and bacon, told your girl don't fix it naked

I go banana-nana-nana, I go crazy, crazy, crazy
I go stupid, stupid, stupid, yay, yay, yay, yay
If you know you turnt up, say: "yay, yay, yay"
If you know you turnt up, say: "yay, yay, yay"
I'm so turned up right now, stuck, but I can't turn down
I'm so turned up right now, stuck, but I can't turn down
I'm so turned up right now, stuck, but I can't turn down
I'm so turned up right now, stuck, but I can't turn down

[Verse 2: Roscoe Dash 2.0]
I'm so high in the air, I cannot breathe
I'm so low to the Earth that I can't even touch my knees
I'm so right that I'm left and I'm so up that I am down
And if you want some trouble, well, look just what you found: it is me
One Fifty Six Three in the 350Z
Riding down Columbia Drive, yeah you niggas remember me
So when I pull up it's a unreal crazy-azy-yay-yay
If you turnt up to the max, then scream: "yay yay yay"

[Hook: Strap & Roscoe Dash 2.0]
I go banana-nana-nana, I go crazy, crazy, crazy
I go stupid, stupid, stupid, yay, yay, yay, yay
If you know you turnt up, say: "yay, yay, yay"
If you know you turnt up, say: "yay, yay, yay"
I'm so turned up right now, stuck, but I can't turn down
I'm so turned up right now, stuck, but I can't turn down
I'm so turned up right now, stuck, but I can't turn down
I'm so turned up right now, stuck, but I can't turn down

[Verse 3: Strap]
Crazy, crazy, crazy, banana-nana-nana
This shit should be illegal, try to lock me in the slammer
Turn up, turn up, turn up, turn up, turn up, I am
Burning, burning, burning up (goddamn!)
Keisha, Misha, Nisha, all them hoes got rammed
Pass her to my partner's partner and that hoe got rammed
This shit getting ridiculous, make these niggas sick of this
Got these niggas bitching, licking on me like some licorice
'Cause I be going bubble
Roscoe, Quez and Ali drunk, but man, I think I'm drunker
Can someone check the bottom for me, well, are you doing numbers?
Numbers, numbers, I'm doing numbers

[Hook: Strap & Roscoe Dash 2.0]
I go banana-nana-nana, I go crazy, crazy, crazy
I go stupid, stupid, stupid, yay, yay, yay, yay
If you know you turnt up, say: "yay, yay, yay"
If you know you turnt up, say: "yay, yay, yay"
