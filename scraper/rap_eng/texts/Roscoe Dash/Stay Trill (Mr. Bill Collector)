[Verse 1: Trae tha Truth]
Don't be thinking about my money, nigga, no
Anybody try to stop it, they gotta go
When I pull up in this new shit niggas know
Probably run up to your bitch with another ho
In these streets I'm still the king
And I wouldn't sell out my city
Probably made to come to move
And I be bringing my city with me, Houston
Gotta get this money right now
Gotta get this money right now

[Hook: Trae tha Truth]
I stay trill
Fuck niggas ain't shit to me
And that's how I feel
Pussy niggas keep testing me like I ain't real
All this money I'm getting, bitch, gonna blow it still
Somewhere off  in this traffic, ain't time to chill
This just how I feel
Nigga, that's just how I feel

[Roscoe Dash]
The only way to live your life is to keep it running til you get to the pesos
So every single day of this life I'm trying to get it
Cause enough ain't enough till I say so

[Verse 2: Trae tha Truth]
All I do is get to the money collecting a sack
While broke niggas be talking, I’m shining,  they way in the back
Got so much a my money on corners I run It like track
Like I dunno wana hear bout nuthin if nuthin don’t stack
Imma be in the spot for a minute tell em take focus
Cuz I'mma focus on hatas til everyone of em notice
If I’m forever the king of the place they say I’m the closest
Can’t nobody compete with the truth they say im the coldest
Pussy niggas keep testing probably cause they was stressin
When see me pull up hoppin outta something n flexin
Everyone a they hoes lookin at me like I'm a blessin
Bout a send em a message and I ain’t talkn bout texting
I get doe til there’s no more
Other niggas wanna shine but all I do is wanna get more
In the city ridin solo if it ain’t fast cash everything else slow-mo
I gtta get this money my hustle got me going insane
All this money keep on calling my name

[Hook: Trae tha Truth]
I stay trill
Fuck niggas ain't shit to me
And that's how I feel
Pussy niggas keep testing me like I ain't real
All this money I'm getting, bitch, go through this deal
Somewhere off in this traffic, ain't time to chill
This just how I feel
Ain't no time to chill
Nigga, that's just how I feel

[Verse 3: Krayzie Bone]
We forever on the paper chase
We chase paper, never time for sleeping, better wake up
And cake up, ain't talking about no money, what you say?
I can't hear you, you're breaking up
Nigga, get off of my cell
If you ain't calling me about me making a mill
Or me making a sale
We money incorporated here
The product he was producing, orchestrated here
And if you look into my eyes
You'll see the reflection of dollar signs
My mind chaotic like the stock market
You would think a nigga starving because a nigga go hard
In the paint go hard if I can't get through
See the domino effect when I knock em off the edge
Mo money for me
And if you wanna try to rob me
You better ask somebody and understand what you coming to see
A nigga coming with heat you better watch out for Frank-Lin
We the true definition of the phrase
Made men, Braveheart, stay hard
Let me shine, let me get a little light, you can stay dark
You can stay pushing filla's in the park, I'd rather move kilos than be your boss
A nigga wanna run shit so I'm never on the dumb shit
And always come equipped
Don't be messing with my money, nigga no
See when Krayzie pull the pump, then I kill em all
The bill collector need his ends he won't ease up tonight

[Hook: Trae tha Truth]
I stay trill
Fuck niggas ain't shit to me
And that's how I feel
Pussy niggas keep testing me like I ain't real
All this money I'm getting, bitch, go through this deal
Somewhere off in this traffic, ain't time to chill
This just how I feel
Ain't no time to chill
Nigga, that's just how I feel

[Roscoe Dash]
The only way to live your life is to keep it running til get to the pesos
