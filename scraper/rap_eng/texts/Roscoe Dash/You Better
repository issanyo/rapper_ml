[Chorus]
I can't flex, girl, you're up next
Like right now, you got 'em upset
Club packed out, she gon' act out
With her back out, I can't back down
Like she don't know no better
She tryna get together
She wanna Run's House
Cameras and Coogi sweaters
She wanna Kim K
She down to do whatever
Girl, if I let you in
Ooh, you better (hey)

[Verse 1]
Ain't no pressure
Blew cheese like the dressin' (blew cheese)
Goin' up like progression
She get down like depression (hey)
Gold rings like protection
Neck freeze like a session
And if she come through like a message
She might not never wanna leave like exes

[Bridge]
Like police, they gon' cop
I got P's like a plot
Hit her knees like sagat
All my weed like Barack
To a tee like a touch
She gon' pull it like a lever
And just like she set me up, she wet me up
I wear a scuba suit when we together (hey)

[Verse 2]
Holla back 'fore your shift over
'Bout to tip over, slap it, put some licks on ya
Yeah, like I been told ya
Yeah she bad, make her bend over
When I send for her, like (yeah)

[Chorus]
I can't flex, girl, you're up next
Like right now, you got 'em upset
Club packed out, she gon' act out
With her back out, I can't back down
Like she don't know no better
She tryna get together
She wanna Run's House
Cameras and Coogi sweaters
She wanna Kim K
She down to do whatever
Girl, if I let you in
Ooh, you better

[Verse 3]
Actin' like a lil' freak or somethin' (yeah)
Actin' like lil' Keisha cousin (boy)
Shakin' ass when she need some money
But don't ever really need it for nothin' (shake it)
Club jumpin' like the Easter bunny (boing)
I'm fresh like Easter Sunday (clean)
Got bottles on keep 'em comin'
I took her home like Felicia comin'

[Bridge]
Like police, they gon' cop
I got P's like a plot
Hit her knees like sagat
All my weed like Barack
To a tee like a touch
She gon' pull it like a lever
And just like she set me up, she wet me up
I wear a scuba suit when we together (hey)

[Verse 4]
Girl, you a meal like [?]
We Netflix and chill like coffee
Wet like seal and bought me
She can't keep her lil' hands off me
She gon' fuck on the kid
Throw that ass like a pitch
Hold up, you just made the list
Break her off like a switch

[Chorus]
I can't flex, girl, you're up next
Like right now, you got 'em upset
Club packed out, she gon' act out
With her back out, I can't back down
Like she don't know no better
She tryna get together
She wanna Run's House
Cameras and Coogi sweaters
She wanna Kim K
She down to do whatever
Girl, if I let you in
Ooh, you better
