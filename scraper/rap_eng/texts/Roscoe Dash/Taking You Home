[Verse 1: Lloyd]
We walk up in this bitch like we the owners
Shawty sipping Moscato, I'm sipping on a Corona
Now she gimme the eye so I know that she wanna
And shawty popping we on a, when it's over she gonna take them clothes off
Girl why you acting brand new round here?
Girl get naked in our section, just the crew round here
And ain't nobody looking for bull round here
You from Texas, girl let's trap it up and screw round here
Hello, if you ready leggo
Keep your ass in there, we keep them ones on the floor
Cause girl you already know that you fine like a glass of red wine
Shawty I just wanna have a good time

[Hook: Roscoe Dash]
Take a shot of this and it's on
Higher than an airplane and we gone
In the VIP counting up and it's on
Shawty be while I'm on, that's why I'm taking her home
Yeah I'm taking her home, yeah we gone
That's why I'm taking her home and we gone
Yeah I'm taking her home, yeah we gone
Shawty be while I'm on, that's why I'm taking her home

[Verse 2: Lloyd]
Got a fine Trinna dime with head to her behind
Off a molly and the pine, man I'm on one
Sipping this red wine, my red flag flying
Bitch I got it on my mind, you don't want none
50 shots to the beat of my drum
She told me put the gun to the tip of her tongue
Told her open up her eyes so she see it when it come
The whole world is mine and she just want some
Yeah she wanna go dumb, go crazy
She want me to go half on a baby
She wanna have fun like everyday the weekend
Ain't nowhere to run, let the games begin

[Hook: Roscoe Dash]
Take a shot of this and it's on
Higher than an airplane and we gone
In the VIP counting up and it's on
Shawty be while I'm on, that's why I'm taking her home
Yeah I'm taking her home, yeah we gone
That's why I'm taking her home and we gone
Yeah I'm taking her home, yeah we gone
Shawty be while I'm on, that's why I'm taking her home

[Verse 3: August Alsina]
You think she on but she don't do that
You looking for your girl but you know she where the crew at
You should know her position, she the centre
And shawty like a Ferrari, doors open, we in her, leather so soft
Run up in that pussy like a track star showing off
Passing the baton to the team now she going off
Shawty head game on fire, blow it off
Giving brain to the whole crew, she a know it all
Lemme know what you sipping, I got it girl, it ain't tricking
I give you what you been missing, girl lemme beat it up in my kitchen, cool
Call a cab when we get through, hell naw I ain't kissing you
But when we in the club, like's through

[Hook: Roscoe Dash]
Take a shot of this and it's on
Higher than an airplane and we gone

Yeah I'm taking her home, yeah we gone
That's why I'm taking her home and we gone

Shawty be while I'm on, that's why I'm taking her home
