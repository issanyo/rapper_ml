Hook:
I got a problem all I wanna do is
Just fuck around and fuck around
Can’t get enough, I keep ended up spending bucks
Just fast I get it like
We Don’t give a fuck ‘cause I don’t don’t don’t don’t don’t
Money come, money goes
And thts the same (?) it goes
These niggas they come
Me I want nothing

Verse:
Everything good, everything would
Bitches chop-chop till a nigga struck struck
I ain’t never gave a f*ck and I still don’t
I ain’t never pay for ass and I still won’t
All the niggas with the same wanna steal bro
When I try with my ride I go real slow
So they all can see, thought of mockery and get the prime let
Let me feel so, amazing I’m sayin’
Every night feel like a vacation
Bad hoes and my lover just waitin’
Think too and then in the 8 year
I get rappers in bed, rappers ahead
So much here I forget what I said
But every time I say thank you she give it again
I’m like thank you, thank you the shit never ends, I mean

Verse:
I go and .. reaching the motherf*cking light limes
So get moon up for the sun up till the night time
Now every day is the best of your life time
The only thing missin’ is the lover of your life time
Bad girls, out girls tell me feelin’ like I’m new here
But some of girls got girls, so when we f*ck it like a true weather
So my dick light weights, too good .. tights fighting over whole ..
But it’s all love they come together and they in just for some true neck
Go pack true .. that’s my favourites .. with a new beaming, that’s my favourite
Feel my new crib on my favourite .., so waited and my favorite pirate
So feel uo money and I made it first
Your bitch made that’s a make a skirt, you niggas get down
I get money and die, big bills on the nigga ..the time, real
