Hook:
I got words for these birds
But I keep it to myself
If the cost ain't involve
Cut it off at the steps
Lord knows
They be watching
Throwing flags like a ref
But I'm so official
She don't see nobody else
100 bottles in the vip girl we got options
100 models pass em off like magic johnson
The way I run it maybe I should run for office
Presidential till they put me in a coffin

Verse 1:
Yeeeaaahhh
When she see me she see me
When she don't she like Stevie
U like bae cook clean and feed me
I just slide in like lungi
Water I bottle her Fiji
Spill it we might need a squeegee
Shooters
Michael dunleavy
Balling not just on yo tv i
My broads don't fight till they leave me I got a cycle believe me
Like its that time of the month
It's always that time of the month
Got one that roll up my blunts
Got one to drive when I stunt
One with a big ole ass and double Ds in the front
I might just pull up in that Lamborghini flexing
With a bag finna blow it like the redskins
Man these niggas so lost
They need direction but I don't fuck with y'all niggas
I'm a lesbian

Verse2:
Yeeeahhh
What's the deal
Girl u got sex appeal
All that ass less dress to fill
I'm playing golden eye
Yeah I'm dressed to kill
I'm dead for real
Let's spin the wheel on
Netflix and chill
We might net flix for real
It's hard to have a bad day
I ain't seen roaches since the roaches in my ashtray
I ain't had less than the best since my last bae
I'm hella str8 like they wrapped my in a cast
(Aye)
Walk it like I talk
Just in case they thought I lost
If yo bitch in designer
Bag it and put it in a coffin
I feel like I'm in Boston
All this green around me
And I got a line to back it

Got damn I'm saucin
