[Verse 1: Roscoe Dash]

Woke up next to two hoes
Two empty bottles of nuvo
Im like, "What the fuck is this, nuvo?"
And my dick lookin' like "You know!"
Me, you, and them and some sumo
And that ass "Shh" keep it cool though
These hoes stay tryna cuff it after they buss it I don't want nothing!
I'm just not go be able
To fuck with you or that fable
Got stallions off in that stable
Keep steak and shrimp on my table
Got a TV screen with no cable
So everytime its movie time
Straight shots, no juice of mine they taking pics of me and my, Clique!
Damn right bitch!
These ducks think they the shit!
But ain't never dropping no hits!
I'm 22 and I'm rich!
So is the fare on my clique!
So when these fuck niggas start bumping im like "Live life trick!"
Man we do this

Everyday x6
Every, every
Everyday x6
Every, every
Everyday x6
Every, every
Everyday x6
Every, every, everyday

[Verse 2: Roscoe Dash]

Woke up in my car
With this bad bitch named star
Only reason why I remember
Cause I was looking up at them stars
When her head was glued to my lap
She ain't even talk or look back
She did her thing, she dipped out, and she ain't even want no dap
Got damn I love that ho for that
She always welcome back
So good I'd pay if I was lame
But I ain't so back to my rap
Damn I'm drunk I need breakfast
Got another bitch like 3x's
Away from here but she crazy she'll get all clingy, started, then reckless
And I'm just not go be able
To fuck with her or that fable
Got a bachelor pad with a maid who
Keep steak and shrimp on my table
I bow my head cause im greatful
Even for the dumb and distasteful
And them lames who love to hate you
But can't say or do shit to break you and yo clique!
Damn right bitch!
These ducks think they the shit!
But ain't never dropping no hits!
I'm 22 and I'm rich!
So is the fare on my clique!
So when these fuck niggas start bumping im like "Live life trick!"
Man we do this
