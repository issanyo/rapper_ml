[Verse 1]
Let me set the stage for ya
Cause you know I like it when I dance for ya
Been anticipatin' when you make it over
Furniture rearranged, I need some space open
Ooh, you lose your mind every time
Life's crazy ain't it
We should party on it
Lifestyle's finally changing, (damn)
Feels like something's going
All live entertainment
Champagne's finally pourin'
And baby, baby, I swear
Close your eyes I'm taking you there

[Pre-Hook]
These flashing lights
I'll let you love me, cause I can tell that you want me
Just you and I
Body to body we gettin' out of this party
Flashing lights
I'll let you love me, cause I can tell that you want me
Just you and I

[Hook: Tinashe (Roscoe Dash)]
Feels like Vegas don't it
Feels like Vegas don't it
Feels like Vegas don't it
Feels like Vegas don't it
Feels like Vegas don't it
(Life's crazy ain't it)
Feels like Vegas don't it
(In the sky, that's crazy ain't it)
Feels like Vegas don't it
(We should party on it)
Feels like Vegas don't it
(In the sky, that's crazy ain't it)
Feels like Vegas don't it

[Verse 2]
How you like it, throw me on the bed
Show me how, to love you the right way, hey
When you're runnin', and I just can't take no more
You go even harder and we end up on the floor
Hey, feelin' on my body
Love it when I call you daddy
Telling me go come get it
I say "baby, I'm ready"
Every kiss getting wetter
Money can't buy this pleasure
I say "baby I'm doin' better, yeah"

[Pre-Hook] + [Hook]

[Break] (x2)
Hypnotised by the flashing lights
Flashing lights, flashing lights
Flashing, flashing, flashing lights
