[Intro]
Watch them trying to rain down on you
Trying to throw a lot of drug seen
Transport 48 I’m your suspect

Bright light down on me
Get crossed and cross the street

And all of them for me
Maufucker

We ain’t got no breaks

And I got the two bars always raised
Girl who’s side you on
She want’s a bad boy like mase
To provide it all
Girl you know I got it

Motherfuckers when you ball
Niggas want to pay attention
I Came up and the mother fuckers came up missing
All these niggas trying to second they could never wizz it
I don’t know what you came to do but I kinda get it

Making ways I make you suck a dick
Hang like a motherfucking curtain
Beat the pussy black and blue like

You in the corner man wishing that you had bitches
Got 99 problems homey but the cash is an issue
Keep a word from me make a bitch splash in it

They all make a sound the amount of cash you get
She made that dick disappear thats a magic trick

Local joker slam dunk in your bitch boy I
Have a future I lead

And I’ll be standing up in that pool
And I’ll be living up on these fools
And trying to hang out with my crew
Pussy popping like a (?)
