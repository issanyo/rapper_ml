[Intro]
Is just too much azz on dat
Too much azz on dat
I can spend ma cash on dat
Is just too much azz on dat
Too much azz on dat
I can spend ma cash on dat

Waddup it’s yo boy Juve the great
Kicking it with ma homie DJ FlyGuy
Play another classic for him

[Hook]
Is just too much azz on dat
Too much azz on dat
I can spend ma cash on dat
Mhhhh  can you work it all night
I promise I can make it all right
No problem I got it I swear
It don’t matter how much I don’t care
And we don’t do ones around here
It’s too much too much
Too much azz [?]

[Verse 1]
Uh (skip)
Everything’s presidential
I even got ma butler and ma maids their credentials
Everything good got it made like a Stencil
Hit Mo put some diamonds in ma chain for the mentals
I been getting I‘ve been sitting up high like a pigeon
My vision so blurry no worries I ain’t tripping
Got a driver and a rider home girl right beside her
Two freaks one me I’m as happy as can be
Now drop it down by the palla gets too much on yo plate
And give me head like you love me
But too bad that I’m late
Yo home girl up under her
With her face in the cake
Slow motion bitch you learn that from Juve the great
Ya heard me flow mean
Stay cleaner than detergent
Sipping while I’m tipping so excuse me
If I’m swerving
When I tell em work hard that’s ma words of encouragement

[Hook]
Mmmmm
Is just too much azz on dat
Too much azz on dat
I can spend ma cash on dat
Mmmmm can you work it all night
I promise I can make it all right
No problem I got it I swear
It don’t matter how much I don’t care
And we don’t do ones around here
It’s too much too much
Too much azz [?]

[Verse 2]
Riding in the back now
Started in a super school
Niggas looking super stupid
At me cause they super fool
I’m about to make it stupid big
I need a stupid hoe
I’m a hood nigga
Took the corner to the studio
Everything is coolio
I’m smoking on a [?]
Visit from yo girl
Come in with [?] and she a cutie yo
Not a lot a booty but I can work with it
Gotta pay attention to it pretty bitches and niggas
I don’t fall for it
Might have to bat it if it’s called for it
Yeah that pussy good
But not enough to lose it all for it, I’ll pass
You bit fine but you down bad
Ain’t the only hoe that got a body like hour glass
She got me with my hands up, Hallelujah
She like how I be shitting on these niggas like manure
And she say she want a nigga from the ghetto I’m the sewer
Baby I get it in I’m about to tattoo ya
Stop playing

[Hook]
Mmmmm
Is just too much azz on dat
Too much azz on dat
I can spend ma cash on dat
Mmmmm can you work it all night
I promise I can make it all right
No problem I got it I swear
It don’t matter how much I don’t care
And we don’t do ones around here
It’s too much too much
Too much  azz [?]
