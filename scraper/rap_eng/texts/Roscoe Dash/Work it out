She got a booty hanging out her skirt
She got her boobies poking out her shirt
She hit the dance floor and made it twerk
Now all the other girls feelings hurt yeah
Gone work it, gone work it, gone work
Gone work it, gone work it, gone work
Gone work it, gone work it, gone work
Get it poppin' in this club, in this club

[Verse 1: Roscoe Dash]
So baby girl you know juts what you doing
You shouldn't be dressed like that
People gone think you be prostituting
I don't mind though, in my eyes girl you fine so
You already know what I'm trying to do
Get you home and take my time on
You ooh, ooh girl you so nasty
You dropping it low I'm on my booty patrol
And ain't a damn thing getting past me
So go and gone swing my way, DJ let this song play
Crazy thoughts all in my mind
But you give me the business all day
So can we make that happen? The vision is attraction
Said she had an A in math
Dropping in the club lights, camera, action
Then came to action, right there on the dance floor
Ha, and this how I dance yo
I said she work it out, while I work it out
Round 1, round 2 , bring the curtains out
She a bad girl, with a perfect mouth
And a body only God had heard about

[Hook]
She got a booty hanging out her skirt
She got her boobies poking out her shirt
She hit the dance floor and made it twerk

Gone work it, gone work it, gone work
Gone work it, gone work it, gone work
Gone work it, gone work it, gone work

[Verse 2: YT]
Lil Mama had one hellava of walk
And I know that she bad

From the look in her eyes I can tell that she wants me

Girl gone do what you gone do put this cash in front of you
