[Verse 1]
Boy don't mess up
Cause you already know I got plenty on my line
And boy guess what
I be doing me, ain't got any on my mind
Cause I be doing me, I be doing me
So what you gonna do, what you gonna do
What you gonna do?
You know you gotta come correct
Cause you only get a one time
That you only get a one time
If you only get a one time
You already know what's up
Gotta come and meet right
And it might be your night, night, night

[Verse 2]
I see you put a work in
And it all looks the same
Yeah, it all looks the same
But I don't even like it
And I won't say a thing

You know you gotta come correct
Cause you only get a one time
You only get a one time
You only get a one time
You already know what's up
Gotta come and meet right
And it might be your night, night, night

Always feel the pressure
Hard to measure up
When its ups go for several
