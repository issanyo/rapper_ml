[Verse 1]
How they let me go and get a beat from kane
I swear these 808s & snares make me go insane
Aye hold up baby girl I really wanna know your name
And let me be your superman & you be Lois Lane
It's showtime like cable, get up on that table
I love your sexy body & I know you love this paper
Bottles coming like they got legs on 'em
The way I kill 'em man this beat will make 'em wanna call the feds on me

[Hook]
I'm orderin' a hundred shots of patron
Girl you better get a cup
And once I get you home
Girl you better give it up
And we gon' have a good good night
Good night, good night
Good night
Good night
We gon' have a good night
Good night, good night
Good night
Good night

[Verse 2]
I got an open palm with cash in it
I could be up for mvp
I'm just tryna out do my last visit
Pockets fat like they pregnant
And 'bout to have triplets
I got 20s flyin' send ghetto benji to adlib it
Hah, get it, I'm so far ahead of my time
No C-section
Y'all club we v.i.p section
Party bus full of women
Like weed next to me
Woulda thought it was a gym the way we flexin'
Line full of sexy ladies tryna get with me
I'm just tryna grand slam like the boy Ken Griffy
And I'm at the bar nine shots no fifty
'Bout to bring a hundred more
Errybody get tipsy

[Hook]
I'm orderin' a hundred shots of patron
Girl you better get a cup
And once I get you home
Girl you better give it up
And we gon' have a good good night
Good night, good night
Good night
Good night
We gon' have a good night
Good night, good night
Good night
Good night

[Verse 3]
We gon' have one hell of a time
Girl I am feeling fine
You know what's on my mind
Give it up
This mad in my swisher got me fine
Your sexy little body got me stuck so what's really good
Girl I wish we really could do what we really should
I know your last boyfriend was only really good
Well I'm excellent a sexual perfectionist
I creep up behind ya deep inside ya no exorcist
That's that extra shit , real long extra thick
A different type of breed a upgrade from that metric shit
It's time to make ya question all the rest ya messin' with
I'm tryna tell ya I'm the one to hit the exit with

[Hook]
I'm orderin' a hundred shots of patron
Girl you better get a cup
And once I get you home
Girl you better give it up
And we gon' have a good good night
Good night, good night
Good night
Good night
We gon' have a good night
Good night, good night
Good night
Good night

[Outro]
We gon' have a hell of a time
Girl I am feelin' fine
You know what's on my mind
Get it up
This mad in my swisher got me fine
This switch on got my mind
Your sexy little body got me stuck so what's really good
