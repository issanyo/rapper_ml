(Hook)
I remember way back when
I used to turn up by myself
Now we done came a long way
Look at everybody else
All they wanna do is turn up
Turn up, turn up, turn up
All they wanna do is turn up
Turn up, turn up, turn up
All they wanna do is…

(Verse 1)
I feel like ridin through the city with my top back
Bad bitch on my head like a top hat
Reminiscin on the money I ain’t got yet
Kill the pain, never gon see me, gotta count that
Whatever I want, at whatever time
Or just a hell of dream for a hell of a wife
For one hell of a blunt I got my head over high
I want a pair for that chick with her hands high
I smoke one hell of a blunt to get my hell of a high
Got a billion texts and know that I’m a good driver
My ex-bitch keep textin, I never replied
Because I went back where she start my nigga without me
I snuck up in the club like I know somebody
I could bought a hotel, even own a lobby
Got so many women I got hoes somebody
And get paid every day like they owe somebody
If you got what it takes better show somebody
Shit, what’s the deal, what’s the word
That nigga Scoe say he ain’t doin hooks no more
Mau’fucker didn’t heard
That nigga got dope bars on deck
No charge, A1, no flaws
Man that nigga go hard as a motherfucker
On God, take pause

(Hook)

(Verse 2)
Look I’mma get money til the casket drop
Yall thought a nigga quit cus I had to stop
I have too much weight, they just have to cop it
And I make some new shit, I just have to drop
Like cut my cheque’s like I had a top
Cus a nigga done been there
You was watchin me, I’m turnin for yo mom’s girl
That’s why you blind over 2 nails
Let me throw a competition on politician
A bearing fact that yall cost efficient
I don’t answer the phone if a cop is missin
So that shit is 911 permission
I need a window and a pot to piss in
I need MJ and Scottie Pippen
And all that help but it still won’t help
Nigga kill yourself but you watch the news
And niggas try to overlook what they don’t understand
But really other bitches turn me out of hand
And I got so many hits that this bitch wanna say
Who wanna catch me? Now enough of that
And it’s a nigga really know song for real
Yea they know it yeah
Cus I’m really better that’s all
And a little bit of that hoe

(Hook)

(Verse 3)
I don’t really be standing I
All the time
And get to this money that’s on my line
I said I’m way too, oh never fall behind
And that’s the same for you and the niggas fall in line
This rap shit can be so much game
It’s like a vacation, the niggas think you down
Some bitch niggas get a glimpse of shinin
Start runnin round screamin that we world is my shit
That ain’t yo line bitch
I get dough in there
Extra fair so stay on top of my shit
Musically I still used to be where I used to be
But I got tired, I’m over that shit
You niggas should be proud of losin’ I’m tired of cruising
I wanna drive off in that shit
Yo bitch won’t slide off of my dick
She love it, uhm I says much ass
You love my style but you’re stuck at me
She stuck to me, I’mma bounce back
To go where she want when she want
Transportation, translation, amputation
Fuck cutting, fuck something
Our squad is the nigga city, can’t come, you never see when I kick it…

(Verse 4)
I’ma in 300 million show
And these flocks just screaming go..
I smoke green, see green I go
Not to wet it with the green I know
I saw it all across the globe
Get 100 thousand a show (money!)
Took off all that shit I owe
Put off all that shit you owe
Never mind that shit cuz it’s right back
Been flexin all on yo bitch ass
I just got a new necklace
And a watch with my wings ass
My girl kissed her girlfriend on the mouth
What a sick ass, you know my sex drivin
She don’t never ever ever ever ever wanna get my game bad
I’m Sinbad, no I sin bad
But every day I got 10 swag
Kill these motherfuckers like Bin Laden
Flow on fire like 10 dragons
She called to the game, yall been laggin
I guess that’s what they mad for
I always knew we was number 1 but just really don’t like the press
So I just kick it…
