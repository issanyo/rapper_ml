[Hook]
I can't turn it off
I'm so nasty with the switch up
I play ball
I'm smoking dopey
And I'm so lit don't know bout yall
I'm rocking shows
Yea I'm rock & rolling
Yes I'm stoned
My bitch she said she miss me
She won't leave me lone
I got ratchet bitches coming out they draws
I'm rocking shows
I'm rock & rolling
Yes I'm stoned
My bitch she said she miss me
She won't leave me lone
I guess I got the juice
I can't turn it off

[Verse 1]
I guess I got the juice
I can't turn it off
I'm so nasty with the switch up
I play ball
I can write for someone else
And rap to ya'll
I'm the chef in the kitchen dripping sauce
And my bitch she ain't got no flaws
And your bitch she ain't got no walls
She let my dawgs hit it playing baseball
Throw it at me then I Knock it out the park
Need fifty, if she want a green card
I caught the game, Now I run it like a bolt
Shawty fuck around like my name too short

[Hook]
I can't turn it off
I'm so nasty with the switch up
I play ball
I'm smoking dopey
And I'm so lit don't know bout yall
I'm rocking shows
Yea I'm rock & rolling
Yes I'm stoned
My bitch she said she miss me
She won't leave me lone
I got ratchet bitches coming out they draws
I'm rocking shows
I'm rock & rolling
Yes I'm stoned
My bitch she said she miss me
She won't leave me lone
I guess I got the juice
I can't turn it off

[Verse 2]
Ain't nothing counterfeit
I created this wave, You doubted it
Most of ya'll broke and ain't found a fix
You ain't doing no numbers, you rounded it
Now you all got to witness, if you been talking keep ya distance
I could switch up in a instant
Pull your card and use your minutes
You can come up short like 4th & inches
Dripping sauce on my cross
Praying hands for your loss
Pocket off when I walk
Hit the club, spread the alkaline, fuck the voss
Expensive water up the cost
Broke ya ankles don't get crossed
Hugs & Kisses send her off
In ya ears like the sloth
You krispy kreme when it's off
Erase ya name like it's chalk

[Hook]
I can't turn it off
I'm so nasty with the switch up
I play ball
I'm smoking dopey
And I'm so lit don't know bout yall
I'm rocking shows
Yea I'm rock & rolling
Yes I'm stoned
My bitch she said she miss me
She won't leave me lone
I got ratchet bitches coming out they draws
I'm rocking shows
I'm rock & rolling
Yes I'm stoned
My bitch she said she miss me
She won't leave me lone
I guess I got the juice
I can't turn it off
