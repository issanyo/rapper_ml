[Bridge: Blaq Tuxedo]
I want you babe
Put that ass on me
Pour me up another drink
I will make you scream my name

[Hook: Blaq Tuxedo (Roscoe Dash)]
Cause this right here for the record
(For the record)
Cause this right here for the record, yeah
Cause this right here for the record
(For the record)
Tell your boyfriend leave a message
Leave a message, (hello?)

[Verse 1: Blaq Tuxedo]
They done let 'em off the leash
Going everywhere I know you wanna be
Who you know that can do it like this, yeah, lease
I compare you to [?]
Tell me what you wanna see?
I hope you're leaving with me tonight

[Pre-Hook: Blaq Tuxedo]
So what do you say, what do you, what do you say, what do you say girl, what do you say girl?
So what do you say, what do you, what do you say, what do you say girl, what do you say girl?

[Bridge] + [Hook]

[Verse 2: Blaq Tuxedo]
When I come in better have my money
Laughing to the bank nigga ain't shit funny
Is that your girl? Cause we know her, but that's another story

[Pre-Hook] + [Bridge] + [Hook]

[Verse 3: Roscoe Dash 2.0]
Riding on top of the ceiling up under the floor
Faded off [?] bitches who already good but thirsty for more
Let's get high, I be honest girl
Probably won't remember half the night, in the morning girl
Cause I've been on ten
Drop top mix
Starts with some lemon drops and some shots of the Henn
And they all finna sin
Said she don't fuck with them hoes
Don't fuck with them hoes
But it's probably gonna happen again
Ass like a Benz, beep beep back it up for me
Three at a time live it up for me
All just for me
She know enough ain't enough for me
Cause this right here for the record
