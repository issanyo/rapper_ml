How come it feel like
Hip hop make a meal aah
Might just take a break from this rap shit
See I dont do it for the money
I do it for the message
They ain't getting so i might just do so acting
Leave by example
Dreams are a sample
Or whatever you way in your mind able to accomplish and
If you could believe it
You can achieve it
Maybe succeeded
Fixation no othtopidic
