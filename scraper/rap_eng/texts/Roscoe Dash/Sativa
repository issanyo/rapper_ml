[Intro]
(I want to get high, so high [x3])

I cop shit they never get
My synopsis is win no other option
Often underrated overpatient it's all good
On vacation in locations they wish they all could

That's as far as I got

*Inhale* It's me and you

2 Point O

Scoe!

[Verse 1]
I prayed all my life one day I'd Find somebody like you
And when I opened up my eyes the only thing on my mind was you
I know it may seem strange, but some things in life ya can't change
I know I know, Obama said, but I'm positive we were made
For each other, Cause no other
Makes me feel like you do girl it's true
I put that on my Mother, As your lover
Raise my hand girl I solemnly swear
To be the kick to your snare
To be the clouds in your air
Together we can do anything
We seen plenty things in our years
Can't nobody understand
Without you theres no life, on god
So if loving you is wrong, then I don't wanna be right
It's me and you for life
Don't need no backups, no options
We A-1 and they watching
Big girls need love too, now they mad as hell they ain't got one
[Hook]
I'm fiendin, I'm fiendin
I need it in the mornin' time
In the evenin', the evenin'
Two times to go to bed
To leave her, to leave her
Would be suicide
It's you and I, Sativa, Sativa
[Leggo!]
It's somethin' bout your love I swear it's got me goin' crazy
God done put you on this earth with me now look what we created
I don't need nobody else but you
I swear girl, you my baby
So it's me and you until the end
No ifs, and, buts, or maybes

[Verse 2]
You been in love befo'
I been with other hoes
But don't none of that matter today [Na!]
We living in holy matrimony
Before we amen bow our heads let us pray [Go!]
I do, Take you
Like the lines on a new tattoo
Through the good, bad, and untrue
I still spend it all on you
My addiction, no friction
She keep my attention
I'm gone off her pulp seed, she blurrin' up my vision
Now all these niggas be wishin'
They could break it down like I do
Fore' I take her down like I do
Now she got love for me and my crew
Shit, and I wonder what we gon' do on our honey moon
I wonder what we gon' do on our honey moon
We should ball out, splurge a little
We gettin' money soon
It's funny when the love of your life is right in front of you

[Hook]
I'm fiendin, I'm fiendin
I need it in the mornin' time [Background: The whole time... HA!!]
In the evenin', the evenin'
Two times to go to bed
To leave her, to leave her
Would be suicide
It's you and I, Sativa, Sativa
[Leggo!]
It's somethin' bout your love I swear it's got me goin' crazy
God done put you on this earth with me now look what we created
I don't need nobody else but you
I swear girl, you my baby
So it's me and you until the end
No ifs, and, buts, or maybes
[It's me and you]
