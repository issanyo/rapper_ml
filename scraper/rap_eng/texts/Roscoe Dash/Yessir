[Verse 1]
Seems like we already been through this (do this)
My flows like Nike "Just Do It" shooters
My own style still shitting on your newest oo-est
Funny these niggas all cubes ain't never Rubix, stupid
I make the game different the same shippin' my aim different
They came slippin' and stay pimpin' but ain't pimpin'
Lanes was a thing for the game, I stay switching
Where age can't change and things they ain't sippin', for real
I pop the seal, what's popping I'm popping seal
I'm the only nigga even for cops I'm hard to kill, what's real
Been slick like eel, I never need the leverage
Niggas level pushing till they find out where the edge is
These labels telling you fabel's, I turn the tables
Black and whites to the dice thats right, I cut the cable
I get cash like flash move fast they like a dreidel
I leave hand spinning like one of them toys up on your cradle

[Intermission]

[Verse 2]
I be opening minds with undermined
I was high but everything will be fine in due time
Definitions free divine when I'm the cosign
Dope like rhymes we shine like goldmine
Legend in the making used to be a product of it
Told me it was real but I know it probably wasn't
So nigga we just steal start it at the bottom of it
And I never ever change even when the common does it, no sir
Inappropriate that's what I prefer
Cause' when shit gets ugly only place to go is go dirt
I try to stay away from liquor so I'm always sober
But when I whop a nigga ass like I'm the chauffeur
No mistaking could be steaking could be replaced in a heartbeat wha-what you thinking you should be thanking
But nigga chafe when they think they see something adjacent that ain't' adjacent cos just they never been a racist ah

[Intermission]

[Verse3]
I feel like Kanye with Taylor, I made em' famous
But I would never taint it cos money could never pick or paint it
This shit relate the way it looks when niggas pave the way and made a way when neighbours way away don't need to say their names
I'm the youngest in charge kept the leash on cause' the swarm like Jesus is home stand up and form
Niggas ready to reform a dorm like he was born
I got plans for the night take flight, meet at the moon
Somebody present, there's somebody present, somebody's present, somebody's probably present but they probably ain't' there probably isn't
I speak Somalian like it's mildly present but it's been a while since somebody's called a body in this ah...
