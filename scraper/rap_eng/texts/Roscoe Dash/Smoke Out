[Verse 1]
Before we get started I got to say shout out to Lue
I’m as high as I’ve ever been smoking in my residence
That’s what I do smoking flavors on flavors
Can’t savor across can’t blow to the face
Rolled up as fat as thumb and gets dumb every time
Have a session with vexing we texting
I spend every dime I ain’t lying
Spying and I’m high as a kite
And the spike rolled up
And I’m leaning no spider
I might have a party with all hoes
So many hoes where is waldo
And that’s also It’s all pro I’m all mess
You just all pro I’m all mess
She’ so set now no judging
And I’m stabbing them to the motherfucking pole
They said they having girl problems smoke out uh

[Verse 2]
Gasoline in the jaw
One hit will start your car
One pound will start a war
Will smell it through the studio door
This hoe don’t tell no flow
Tell tomorrow plans we bought
Destination paper making
Situation get you far
Palpation my heart
My heart only beating for green
Money and weed my el camino
That motor making a scene
I wasn’t even trying to be seen
I was just trying to slide off the scene
With a bitch so bad she just mean
With a big ol’ ass in that glass house
I put that bitch on them knees
