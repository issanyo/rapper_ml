[Hook: Roscoe Dash]
I be over here, I be over there
You be on the outside wishin you were here
I be at the club, I be at the spot
You be talkin big but you really, really not
Cause you ain’t me and I ain't you
I ain't even gotta try, this is what I do
Cause you ain’t me and I ain't you
I ain't even gotta try, this is what I do
This is what I do

[Verse 1: B.o.B]
This is how my day go
Wake up, cross over, fade ho
I wake up with that leggo, 28th floor but I lay low
No lease ‘cause it’s paid fo, stack chips with my queso
Straight shots no hangover, real bitches, no fake hoes
Two chicks in Barbados, we bake O's like begals
Hasta luego, pasta alfredo
Authentic Italian linguine, Pasta, no Prego
Call me lieutenant, riding in a whip windows tinted
Got a tour bus with a room in it, loud pack, no stems, no seeds in it
When I ride on the beat, man I groove in it, hell yessir, I handle bussiness
I'm so prolific, it's no impostor-ing and no pretending

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Roscoe Dash]
Do it, do it, I did it, did it; it’s done, it's done, it’s finished, finished
Since I gotta put in that overtime gotta make that mine - I spin it
Man I got hits on hits on hits so why the hell they keep on pitchin
Got a whole lot of haters who don't '@' me when they mention
My music is like a drug man I’m just filling another prescription
I'd duck school and put the beat it at the school dentention
Call me Captain Hook, man absolute, murder make me a burger
I’m so further like some place that you ain’t hurt the pound working
See I gotta handle my business, I am so ambitious
I got big dough, that's biscuit, 30 knots ain't trippin'
So when I walk around that’s fitness, I passport when I visit
Overseas ball no pivot, you talk about it and I live it

[Hook]

[Verse 3: B.o.B]
Since day one you heard me from the underground to the surface
I rose out of the fire, I emerged out of the furnace
But I knew that my time would come, And I couldn't be more deserving
Man I swear I'm good for life, but still I'm far away from perfect
Shit I’m straight like 12:30, I'm eatin' good, Im burping
Chillin with brown sugar and cinnamon, one butter scotch and one Hershey (Good God)
With a booty so big you can probably Google Earth it
I’ma hit it girl with that long jump, With that Jackie Joyner, that Kersee
Now squirt for me, twerk it for em
I’m the professor of Real Nigga University
I hold my team down, anchorman Ron Burgundy
I’m tryin tell you man, I'm sharper than surgery
Bobby Ray!
