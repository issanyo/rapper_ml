[Chorus: Roscoe Dash]
Call me shorty shorty, I got all the shorties
Light skin, dark skin, all kind of shorties

Light skin, dark skin, all kind of shorties, tell 'em
Shorties, shorties, I got all the shorties

Call me shorty shorty, I got all the shorties
Light skin, dark skin, all kind of shorties

[Verse 1: Kid Ink]
Yeah, you could call me take her home shorty
Herbal Essence in me, I can make her moan shorty
Hit it so good, might break a bone shorty
And she calling right now, better take her phone shorty
You a ten in the game, naw this ain't notary
But she on my joy stick tryna play me 'til the morning
See the green light, headed straight for her Xbox
The ex shorty tell her suck it like xpock nigga
You could call her long drive shorty
Ride all night, no pit stop shorty
Is that your chick? Don't leave her lonely
Cause my middle finger's up, I don't give a fuck shorty, tell 'em

[Chorus: Roscoe Dash]
Call me shorty shorty, I got all the shorties
Light skin, dark skin, all kind of shorties

Shorties, shorties, I got all the shorties
Shorties, shorties, I got all the shorties
Call me shorty shorty, I got all the shorties
Light skin, dark skin, all kind of shorties

[Verse 2: Kid Ink]
Said it's Kid Ink baby, 'bout to pop her gayno
Kick flip chicks, got them shorties like skaters
I ain't Chris Brown nigga but it's deuces to the haters
Bring your girl around me and watch it change her behaviour
Transform, turn her to a little freak, little freak
TLC shorty, finna creep
Better cuff your chick, we'll be outta here shortly
Get her in my circle, that's all like Porky
You know it's been this way since the shorty
I be in the section for the very important
Need some drink in my cup, baby you can pour it
Call me swisha sweet shorty, turn this room into a forest

[Chorus: Roscoe Dash]
Call me shorty shorty, I got all the shorties
Light skin, dark skin, all kind of shorties
Call me shorty shorty, I got all the shorties
Light skin, dark skin, all kind of shorties, tell 'em
Shorties, shorties, I got all the shorties
Shorties, shorties, I got all the shorties
Call me shorty shorty, I got all the shorties
Light skin, dark skin, all kind of shorties

[Bridge: Kid Ink]
Yeah, yeah, I see your shorty get it
Yeah, yeah, I see your shorty get it
Yeah, yeah, I see your shorty get it
Get it, get it, I see your shorty get it
Rocket ship shorty in this bitch right now
Phantom high in space, tell a nigga, "Come down"
Said it's rocket ship shorty in this bitch right now
Phantom high in space, tell a nigga, "Come down"

[Chorus: Roscoe Dash]
Call me shorty shorty, I got all the shorties
