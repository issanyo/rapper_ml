[Verse One: Roscoe Dash]
A lot of shits changed since the last time I saw you
A lot hasn’t they prolly still wishing that I would fall through
Rappers told me if I ever need it just to call you
So here I am again to tell you everything I aught too
Monsoons, typhoons, hurricanes tsunamis
All the shows, Rolls, planes all remind me of you
You, you, you, you
You, you, you, you, you

[Hook]
Ever since I started its been me and you regardless
Through all the popping bottles and all the pain and hardships
Its you, you, you, you, you
Its you you, you, you…
And me
