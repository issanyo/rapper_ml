[Intro]
Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo
Doo
I just wish you knew (Doo, doo)
How much I still love you (Doo, doo)

[Verse 1]
I've got to see you
Wherever you are
And I've got to be there
I'm wishing on stars
I've got to reveal what's inside of my heart
But the words escape me
And I'm paralyzed
So helpless when I
Look into your eyes

[Chorus]
And how I wish you only knew
What I feel inside for you
You probably haven't got a clue
But I wish you knew
How I love you, baby
(How I love you, how I love you)

[Verse 2]
Honestly I know it's silly of me
To want you so badly
But keep it concealed
See my inferiority complex kicks in
And the words escape me
And I'm paralyzed
So helpless when I
Look into your eyes

[Chorus]
And how I wish you only knew
What I feel inside for you
You probably haven't got a clue
But I wish you knew
How I love you, baby
(How I love you, how I love you)

[Spoken Bridge]
I don't know if anybody else outside there tonight
Who knows what it feels like
To want somebody so bad
That nothing and nobody
Can ever seem to fill that void
That is the situation that I'm talking about right now
And if you feel me
Sing the song with me
Come on

[Chorus]
And how I wish you only knew
What I feel inside for you
You probably haven't got a clue
But I wish you knew
How I love you, baby
(How I love you, how I love you)
I wish you only knew
What I feel inside for you
'Cause you probably haven't got a clue
But I wish you knew
How I love you, baby
(How I love you, how I love you)
I still love you
