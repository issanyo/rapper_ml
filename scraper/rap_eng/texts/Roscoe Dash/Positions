[Verse 1]
On on on
On a contrary to what you believe
I get ma mo money bags from often these beats
Some for my mom some for my daughters even some I can keep
But bottom lines the bottom line ain’t no one fucking with me
I’ve been spending all my time and keeping all my receipts
And I ain’t gotta read the paper
They know talking is cheap
I get so up in the cloud ma week be trying to compete
You’re in the presence of greatness right now as we speak
Lost an abundance of sleep
From niggas sleeping on me
Don’t need your sorry
I’m sorry but you can keep it homie
All ma shit be busting
Oh yeah I keep it on me
Surprise to all those who waited
Until the weekend for me
Here I go bombing first GI-Joe
I’m the lean and roll
Who these people need to know
This the Cleveland show
I’m who these niggas eating on
Who’s seeds they seeding on
Who they call when they need a song
Who you leaning on
Asking favorite artists
Who they favorite artists
I don’t need to bug
And that ain’t my department
Jumping steady acting like I’m John [?]
Fucking up yo market like ma name coming
The shit we on stepping on em
King coming gone to the champ
Like Michael without his rings on
Who wants contest, best guard your chest
Could hook him dead in the mouth
But the chest takes all of your breath

[Verse 2]
Mind jogging like I’m Marshall Fargo
They don’t love me many laws and they just like to talk it
Who’s the hottest on the market that’s an easy target
Make him have to pee the pocket fore I catch a carcass
Get rich or die trying
I’m doing both regardless
I said that way back when
Oh now ima go the hardest
This year it’s all about home
Y’all just gone have to margin
Or else we can’t do business
Y’all just gone have to forge it

[Hook]
Ima give these niggas what they came to see
Still the same street homie
Ain’t no change in me
I’ve been the one dog and its plane to see
All these people really need is a gang of me
And I know I ain’t tripping
And I know I ain’t tripping
I done been here before
Now they know I was pimping
Gotta pay all they hoes
Now they know I was pimping
I just play my position
I just play my position

[Verse 3]
I bring you my strategy
Every time no inns bust are possibly
Maybes maybes but only if she catch my babies
I can sell some babies
Cage me [?]
The illest nigga alive since 2008
See ain’t shit change but the date and time
It’s all rhetorical but the moves I make
Are far from dreaming
Somewhere the story go back down I order you
I’m getting money more than you
Too much juice I’m [?]
Porter house by the porter pool
Pour some drinks and enjoy the view
I call this the finer things
But you ain’t hip to that cause you been trapping all kinda things
Started rocking designer chains fame pussy forgot your name
And you expect for us to listen to what you tryna say
I passed dope pass your back down
Don’t ask all good weed cash flow
Win some Instagrab em
Been holding down the pay and got venus a bonus
The hood is just a bonus incase you ain’t notice
They gone learn this time I swear I’m ma only
And they gone spend the rest of they life tryna clone it
Look at my phone there’s so many unread messages on it
Just as I expected just when I’m excelling

[Hook]
Ima give these niggas what they came to see
Still the same street homie
Ain’t no change in me
I’ve been the one dog and its plane to see
All these people really need is a gang of me
And I know I ain’t tripping
And I know I ain’t tripping
I done been here before
Now they know I was pimping
Gotta pay all they hoes
Now they know I was pimping
I just play my position
I just play my position
