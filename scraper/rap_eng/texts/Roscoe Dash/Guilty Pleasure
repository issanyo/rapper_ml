Go girl you bad as fuck, ass fat and you tatted up
I cant lie, baby I might die, if I leave alone I cant pass it up
Theres no competition, no catching up
Them other girls be mad as fuck
You slave for it, they pay for it
They made for it, ain't adding up
You hit the stage with your ass out
Work hard till they pass out
You the one that they ask bout
They steady bringing them racks out
You work out till you pass out
Work hard till you pass out
Work hard till you pass out
Show them hating hoes what that cash about

Go girl, its movie time
Go and do your thang
I wish I had a camera and a film crew, I do
Cause I do the major pain
Drilling like a hole in the ground
I lay that pussy in a hole in the ground
A killer not a word or a sound
Or a beat the ...wet wet, cigarella could have drown
I can tell you work overtime for that body
Overtime for that profit
And damn girl I got it
I mean damn girl you got it, ha
Say you putting girls to shame
Ben franks to blame
You go crazy for that mula
I give a fuck about no fame
I give a fuck about no chain
Doesnt get in no chain
And I guess that makes me the main
Cause I fucked before I even knew your name
Now I just say

I just wanna see you, in something to see through
I know that we just met girl
But I still feel like I need you
I want to, believe you
When you say its all mine girl
Work so hard need a chiropractor
Let me fix your spine girl
Take you back to my condo
Hit you up like Rondo
You drop it low like a lambo
I kill the pussy like Rambo
Damn it, damn it, feel so good, I
Got you working overtime
Soon as you get off girl
Thats when Im gonn get mine
I know you work hard, I know you twerk hard
You know I stay hard, now its time to play hard
You like a guitar, and Im a rockstar
Get in it like pornstar, keep working girl and you go far
