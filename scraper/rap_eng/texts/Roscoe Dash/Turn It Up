[Intro: Mishon]
I see the life of the party
We don't get it started
Till' I I I I I walk in
Till' I I I I I walk in
Till' I I I I I walk in
Dj turn it up up up up up up up
Dj turn it up up up up up up up
Now watch the girls pick it up and drop it down (drop it down)
Watch the girls pick it up and drop it down

[Verse 1: Mishon]
Now I ain't got no curfew, so when this thing ends
On to the next one, we gon' get it in
Let the crowd rock and let the beat spin
Heard 'em say encore, drop it again
Grab a lil' shawty, hands all on her body
Walk into the bass while she droppin' it low
Sweat all on her hands soon as she hit the floor
Then she turn around and had my eyes like woah

[Pre-Hook: Mishon]
Yep the beat steady knockin'
Then you see me walkin'
And i'll be like go'on girl, go'on girl do yur thing, stop
That's why them girls like to party with me
That's why them girls like to party with me

[Hook: Mishon]
I be the life of the party
We don't get it started
Till' I I I I I walk in
Till' I I I I I walk in
Till' I I I I I walk in
That's when the Dj turn it up up up up up up up
Turn it up up up up up up up
Now watch the girls pick it up and drop it down (drop it down)
Watch the girls pick it up and drop it down

[Verse 2: Mishon]
Girls gon' wild, pullin on my shirt
Treat 'em like its 9 ta 5 Imma go to work
Its time to clock in, I'm puttin on a show
They don't even know, they don't even know
Rock to the left, rock to the right
Girl now slooooww motion bring the beat back
Keep it goin don't stop till ya break that back
Ta, tell the Dj its yur song, yu need ta play that back

[Verse 3: Roscoe Dash]
Drop it drop it down drop it down to the floor

[Verse 4: Roscoe Dash]
All these pretty ladies, I don't know which one to choose
So I think I'll take 'em all, there's noway I can lose

The party don't start, until I get up in it
And i keep it turned up (turn me up)
