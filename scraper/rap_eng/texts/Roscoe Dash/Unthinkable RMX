Chorus
No weapons formed against me
I'm on my way, on my way to destiny
But before i go
I promise, i promise to give the best of me
And bring back whatever's left of me
When my journeys over, when my journeys over

Verse 1
Girl, you're the one that i started with
Had a lot of good times about the harder shit
To be without ain't an option, postpartum shit
We gonna make it work no matter how hard it gets
We came far from preforming the unthinkable
And if i ever scared enough id love to be unsinkable
The outcome really ain't for me to know
I just want that codeine love, girl just take it slow
