[Bridge: Reo Cragun]
I was working on myself, had to get my mind right
Busy thinking about the past, now I have no hindsight
I would've been without a dollar, many days of my life
Now I'm 'bout to hit the stage, ready for the limelight
Limelight

[Hook: Reo Cragun]
Ayy
Ready for the limelight, limelight
Ayy
Ready for the limelight, limelight
Ayy
Ready for the limelight, limelight
Ayy
Ready for the limelight, limelight

[Verse 1: Sincerely Collins]
Yo, these niggas all in a glass case of emotion
Damn fam, you sittin' in last place and I'm coastin'
Saucin', I got the potion
Puttin' women in motion
Get em' wet like the ocean
Oh shit, call me Moses
Oh my god, oh my god
If I die, I'm a legend
Yeah I'm a prophet, a teacher
Nigga, school is in session
See, I was stuck at the bottom
Homie, that was depressin'
But then I reached for the stars
Homie, that was a blessin'

[Bridge: Reo Cragun]
I was working on myself, had to get my mind right

[Hook: Reo Cragun]
Ayy
Ready for the limelight, limelight

[Verse 2: Troy Ave]
Hard work, dedication
And many prayers to the lord
I've been working on myself
You could say I'm self-absorbed
Self-made, self-paid
You ain't gettin' any man, you wildin'
I'm always stallin', 'cause I'd made it like Tallinn
Swimmin', I see me shinnin'
Singin' "Ha, Imma stove!"
Got a few chicks, but I keep a spit
Imma car, "vroom!"
Drivin' women crazy
Ayy these bitches bad, ayy these bitches mad
I'm the Rabies
You can't do nothing, word

[Verse 3: Roscoe Dash]
I got way too many cameras all in my face
You know I love that limelight
But sometimes I need space, nigga
Old girl callin' my line, she know that a nigga patience thin
Then they dudes can't hang with me
They was never made for this, please
Imma need fifty racks a week, Imma feed the whole team
I been thinkin' about the limelight since a boy used to be a dream (Hold up)
I found my way, I kept it low-key (Hold up)
Yea, you better ask about me
Yeah, I've been waitin' for the limelight
Man, I've been waitin' 'till the time's right
Alright, flow hella cold, Klondike
Nigga always blow an Ellen show, like a Blonde Dyke (Alright)
You wanna up and up, up, this ain't enough
You niggas can't get with me
See I just got a curtain for my Jacksons
Back to backs, and in the mattress, like I'm fifty
Man, I got a bad bitch like an actress, but she don't be actin' when she with me
Lil' mama be packin' like a century
Swear to god she got a backside of the century
What a comma
These days, these days
I'm fuckin' up these stays
Got me waitin' on a drop, like a box from East Bay
Damn it, spendin' on my Air Max tryna win the freeway
But no, this not a sweepstakes, cheapskate
I’m eatin' good, hella cheese steak
When you mention us, mention that we straight
What’s a player without all of his teammates?
Sincerely
