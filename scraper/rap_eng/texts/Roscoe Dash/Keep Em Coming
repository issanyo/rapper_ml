I just wanna party till I can’t no more
Buy all of the bottles 'till there ain't no more
Tonight I’m going in like it’s my last
Tell them keep em coming you ain’t even gotta ask( you ain’t even gotta ask )
Keep em coming
Keep em coming

It’s a Friday, time to party man tha nights young
Club full of women just like I like ‘em
What to Drive? Man, Tha black or the white one
I be shinning, look like day in the night time
I gotta go & pick up my partner
He designated to drive
Cause I might get too intoxicated
Tonight might just be that night
I feel like buying off the whole bar
Make'em hit the store to get more
We celebrating, Y'all hesitating
What the fuck is you waiting?
I said don’t worry about us running out
We got stupid bottles, we plenty loud
Stupid Benz We Kick'em out
But We wrecklesz man so it’s going down
I say grab a cup, fill it up, throw it back & pour another one
We going in, we on ten, can’t stop now the partys just begun

I Just Wanna Party Till I Can't No More
And Buy all of the bottles till there ain't no more
Tonight I’m going in like it’s my last
Tell them keep em coming you ain’t even ( you ain’t even gotta ask )
Keep em coming
Keep em coming

Keep em coming, keep em coming all night long
I’m just looking for a cutie I can take home
I just want the DJ to play the right song
Can’t fight the feeling, fight the feeling
Cause the feeling strong
I’m out … she almost got out
I’m watching while she grind
She got me fantasizing, I’m bout to loose my mind
I whisper in her ear, she put my hand on her behind
I asked her what she trying to do
She said she trying to ride
Trying to hit her and her partner
20 piece, 2 dimes
They thinking I ain’t down for it
I’m up right on time
I got a head full of intentions
That’s submissions I’m gonna try
I’m drunker than a fool
Man, it’s going down tonight, let’s go

I Just Wanna Party Till I Can't No More
And Buy all of the bottles till there ain't no more
Tonight I’m going in like it’s my last
Tell them keep em coming you ain’t even ( you ain’t even gotta ask )
Tell them keep em coming
Keep em coming, keep em coming, keep em coming
