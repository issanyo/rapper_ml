Everywhere I go I
Dress up and I go out
I got lots of gwalla, let me show you how I show out
Everywhere I go I
Dress up and I go out
I got lots of gwalla, let me show you how I show out

(Show out) Gucci, Louis, Prada, man I'm all about my dollas
(Show out) I be all up in the mall ballin like it's no tomorrow
(Show out) Gucci, Louie, Prada, man I'm all about my dollas
(Show out) I be all up in the mall ballin like it's no tomorrow (out out out out)

[Verse 1:]
I got lots of gwalla, I spend it
I'm a ball-a-hollic like my money, never ending
Pockets so swole just like Popeye on his spinach
Like Roscoe why you grind so hard? I'm like I'm tryna get it
And that's just how I do it, hit the mall with bout 10 stacks; but you know that I blew it
Hit the blunt, and threw it. That's just how we do it
V.I.P. with M.M.I. you know we gon be stupid
You know I make it rain ho, Goosey by the bottle, blowin fruity like a mango
Gone and catch this change ho, yeah we in this thang ho
It's R-O-S-C-O-E dash, I'm headed for the fame ho

[Verse 2:]
Show out, show out, show out, all I do is show out
Inhale the kushhh, then I blow out
SS Camero bitch, watch me as I go out
Back to the crib with yo girl and I go out
We don't even go out, all she do is ho out
I don't even know her and I fucked er, what you know bout that?
See all she know is Roscoe got dem racks
Now my meat's between her buns like a fuckin Big Mac
And everytime she place her order, I beat her then deport her
I get heads and tails like both sides of the quarter
Shawty bad, she expensive; so you prolly couldn't afford er
But every time I see her it's crunch time, like we in the fourth quarter, and I'm gone
