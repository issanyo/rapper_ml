[Chorus:]
H & M Whats' Up
Adidas What's Up
American Eagle What's Up
True Religion What's Up
And I be rockin' all type of colors
I be swaggin' like no other
And I be so animated
Cuz my face on every cover
H&M and American Eagle got me fly
Adidas-Adidas-Adidas I'm on fire

[Verse 1:]
And I be rockin all type of colors
My swag is like a sauna (er)
I be dressin like a hippie
You could swear I was a stoner
Where'd you get ya swag from
Sir I swear that I'm the owner
Why should I believe you
Cuz I don't fuck with loaners
I get it how I live it I swear that's my true religion
I spent 25 strong just in true religion
Then I hit Adidas just to get my feet up
That's another 20 bands damn
I'm glad I got my cheese up
I be shoppin, shoppin, shoppin, shoppin, shoppin all day
And land in station H&M damn near every day
Then I hit the eagle now I'm flyer than a eagle
And the way that I be swaggin'
Man this shit should be illegal
Come on

[Chorus:]
H & M Whats' Up
Adidas What's Up
American Eagle What's Up
True Religion What's Up
And I be rockin' all type of colors
I be swaggin' like no other
And I be so animated
Cuz my face on every cover
H&M and American Eagle got me fly
Adidas-Adidas-Adidas I'm on fire

[Verse 2:]
Roscoe dash be poppin' tags
Please get the picture
Shout out to ATL express

Big Ups to David Swisher
For supplying all these swishers
But cuz we need 3 mo' bottles
And these ladies won't a picture

Standing on the furniture like DJ turn me up
Ending how we feel online

They penny pissed we gettin' rich
That's why we got them stacks
Every days a pay day so you know where to find me
Many say in Atlanta station
Ballin' like a athlete
Roscoe Dash got stupid swag if anybody ask me
Where I be shoppin at I reply

[Chorus:]
H & M Whats' Up

[Lil Doom:]
Got a eagle on my chest and I'm lookin real fly
When I hit the mall all the girls give me the eye
And people we must ride
Them Journey's Keep Me high
When I fill my white boy swag
Yea I look the way I shop
I got all different colors

Keep me hotter than the summer
Got mo' kicks than a plunter

And I be so animated
Put my face on every cover
Ohhh Ohhh Ohhhh

Check my jeans What's Up
Swag on Me What's Up
And I hit the mall
And I and I hit the mall like
