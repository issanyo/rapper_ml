Alright, come on
Oohhhhhhhhh
Come on...
I know I sound a little different on the radio
But don't be mad, I'm just doin what they pay me for
I find myself constantly thinkin "what they hatin for?" but I know...
It's cuz I'm headin to the top and
I ain't never stoppin, can't nobody bring me down...
Be the fire from a flame, now watch me change the Game
This gonn be how they cool me down...

Ooooooooooooohhh

I'm burnin up, when you hear me on the radio, gon and turn it up...
Mr. Often Imitated, but never duplicated...
Wonderin why these niggas hatin, but it's probably cuz I made it...
And the top is such a lonely place
Like everywhere that I go I can't help but to see a phony face
Cuz the same ones down me
When I come pound me, get the fuck around me now...
Roscoe Dash goin straight to the top
Cuz I'm so turned up and I can't turn down... I swear its...
It's all I know, I grind hard, and I know it shows
But it's all I know...

Come on...
I know I sound a little different on the radio
But don't be mad, I'm just doin what they pay me for
I find myself constantly thinkin "what they hatin for?" but I know...
It's cuz I made it to the top and
I ain't never stoppin, can't nobody bring me down...
Need a fire from a flame, now watch me change the Game
This gonna be how they cool me down...
