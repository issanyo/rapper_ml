[Intro]
Scoe!

[Verse 1]
She used to ride in a Taurus
Before I found her
Now she ridin' them horses
But ain't no horses no where around her
She be cruisin' all through the city
Top off showin' them pretty titties
Doin' 95 inside a 50
Shawty tryn' to get a ticket
Rollin' up the palm baby I'm with it
Hit the weed, baby smoke something
It's so much better when you're on a high
And we can switch where you want
Cause a it's gonna be a long drive

[Hook]
Me you and the road
Bout to get closer than we ever been
I got all the gas you need
We don't know where we going
But hopefully this trip will never end
You got all the world I need

[Verse 2]
We almost up outta Georgia
(I told her slow down)
But she don’t wanna (Nope)
She told me she rides, she rides
‘Til we die 3 times (Damn)
Whatever that means
That’s my baby
She’s on the D
She kiss, leave hickies all over me
She don’t want nobody, only me
On this four lane highway with only two lanes
Road rage, baby you do things
I’m in love, fully yours
Truly yours..I’m fully on

[Hook]
Me you and the road
Bout to get closer than we ever been
I got all the gas you need
We don't know where we going
But hopefully this trip will never end
You got all the world I need

You Murk-in' these bitches
Goddam
God dang goddam
You Murk-in' these bitches
Goddam
Ah Murk Em!

[Verse 3]
She know where she walkin'
The bitch tippin' like she money could coughin'
But she way more badder
Ass way more fatter
It e'en got the bitches drippin' like faucets
She buzzed as hell, gets high as hell
Fat as sin and I'm tryin' to tell ya
Lots o niggas been tried and failed
But I got it, yeah, I got it yeah
I order three for me, I order three for her
Wanna leave with me, she wanna be secure
It's been a while since you took a trip on the wild side
Take ya out there with a real nigga outside
Tell me where you wanna
She reached up and said, "Where you want me?"

You Murk-in' these bitches
I swear you Murk Em
I swear you Murk Em
You Murk-in' these bitches
I swear you Murk Em
I swear you Murk Em
