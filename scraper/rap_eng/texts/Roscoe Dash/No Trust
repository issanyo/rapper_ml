(Intro)
I guess this is how it’s gotta be
Just can’t fuck with me pussy nigga
Yea
Ha ha

(Bridge)
I got a bad bitch that’s gonna ride for me
When the time comes she gon lie for me
I don’t know what the bitch said
If it came down she a die for me
Man I don’t trust these bitches (No, no)
I don’t trust these bitches just like I don’t trust these niggas

(Verse - Spiff)
But my brother ‘Scoe – that’s a real nigga
But you already knew that
Cuz he went and showed me love
When he didn’t much had to do that
I’m rollin with no thugs
Mom you raised a go getter
And I got up out the mud so I don’t owe shit to no nigga
Well let’s go nigga, that’s gold nigga
I’mma show you how it’s build straight
On the second album nigga
So fuck you and yo mixtape
And I don’t trust these bitches (Nooo)

(Hook 1)
I got a bad bitch that’s gonna ride for me
When the time comes she gon lie for me
I don’t know what the bitch said
If it came down she a die for me
Man I don’t trust these bitches (No, no)
No I don’t trust these bitches

(Hook 2)
Got some real niggas that gon ride for me
When the time comes they gon lie for me
I don’t know what the nigga said
If it came down he’ll die for me
Man I don’t trust these niggas (No, no)
No I don’t trust these niggas

(Verse - Roscoe Dash)
Sitting back looking at my past time
Way before I even had mine
Studio everyday just to pass time
So we blew up like a landmine
Tryna part on halftime
Bad bitches and the same was the last time
Mami anytime I have time
And I ain’t really even have time
Some things never change nah (Leggo!)
I swear it’s funny how they used to
Niggas wanna come around, when?
I’m steady getting money, spending money just as fast as I get it
Hoes getting mad, you don’t call when you visit but
Way back then
Them bitches say hey back back then
Had your back then and I back then clap clap
Baby lights camera action

(Hook 1)
I got a bad bitch that’s gonna ride for me
When the time comes she gon lie for me
I don’t know what the bitch said
If it came down she a die for me
Man I don’t trust these bitches (No, no)
No I don’t trust these bitches

(Hook 2)
Got some real niggas that gon ride for me
When the time comes they gon lie for me
I don’t know what the nigga said
If it came down he’ll die for me
Man I don’t trust these niggas (No, no)
No I don’t trust these niggas
