[Hook: King Chip]
They said I was gon' get paid, my nigga, but damn
They said I was gon' get laid, my nigga, but damn
Real nigga don't got friends, nigga just got fam (x2)
They said these niggas gon' hate, my nigga, but damn (x2)
Real nigga don't got friends and we just got fam (x2)

[Verse 1: Roscoe Dash]
Everyday, I wake up and I praise the Lord
Cause it's another day I get to ride around in what they can't afford
I beg your pardon, my whip's clean, I'm fresh as fuck
My bitch mean, there's no pressin' her
And she freshin' up while I'm restin' up
So, when I wake up, it's the naked butt
On the regular, my nigga, I been gold, go figure
So they spoil me like I was royalty
I'm well taught to be so that's venom
On the beat, I go gorilla, guaranteed to go vanilla
Every time, all the time, I got money all in my phone line
I said one time for my crew
Out to get paid as fuck cause we do
Out to get laid as fuck cause we do
But, wait, if we lame as fuck, that makes you
Haterade for the hater-made
I'm on layaway and this player say
Wit' mad wishes, two bad bitches
That use they teeth to play badminton like

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Dusty McFly]
Got a bag on the way though I'm just waitin' on it, one phone call
Tell my nigga don't stress for shit cause, one day, we all gon' ball
Real nigga from day one and I'm puttin' all of my niggas on
Real nigga from 4-1, niggas know that's my hood, dog
I wake up with a hangover off Ros√© and Dom P
Light skin nigga, wipe-ups, hoes swear they thought they seen Jon B
[?] Ave where you find me, broke ass niggas can't outshine me
Paid 20 sleeks for the time piece and the wipe-ups cost 5 sheets
Been grindin' non-stop for eight weeks, bout to hit ya main bitch, she a straight freak
Been thinkin' bout flooding me a AP cause the spot still bangin' like Dre beats
Got bowls of the Rick, bout eight each, can't let y'all broke niggas fade me
Y'all ho ass niggas, they hate me, but it's always "Fuck you, pay me"

[Outro Hook: King Chip]
They said these niggas gon' hate, my nigga, but damn (x2)
Real nigga don't got friends and we just got fam (x2)
