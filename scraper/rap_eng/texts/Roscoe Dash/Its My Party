It's a mu'f*ckin party
And We finna turn it up
Them hatas still hatin on ya
Well, I don't really give a fuck
I never did, no I never did
It's my party I'll get fly if I wanna
So pops and every smoke that plus marijuana, aha
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
And we gonna set this b*tch off
Okay we gon' set it off then
I'm with stony clear franky what the cost is
And white girls tryin to sneak that Kate Moss in
But all I want is green like I'm from Boston
Sippin on this Sampson, feeling like I'm on a lamborghini
Highs f*ck ..tryin to figure out who just passed me this
But two German broads both pacifist
And never learned heard after this
But they both love my songs, they do
So they all out comers extravagant
She wrote me, she roll her and I chauffeur
Six speeds and if I hit three than it's over, I swear
She say she miss me 'cause she get D like I owe her
And that's when i told her

Hook:
It's a motherf*cking party, and we finna turn it up
Them haters standing hatin on ya
I don't really give a f*ck
I never did, no I never did
It's my party I get fly if I wanna
So pops and every smoke that plus marijuana, aha
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
And we gonna set this b*tch off
Money money, party party party party
Grab them double cups and turn up, turn up, turn up, turn up

[Hook:]
Okay I walk in this bitch with contraband
Is it wrong that I light this tree?
Is it wrong that I hate your stance
Because I would rather see you on your knees?
Is it wrong that I
That I that I that I came here just to fuck?
Or am I okay,'cause she walking round the room like an 18 wheeler truck what's up
Skirt, pull up that skirt
I could be the punisher and make that hurt
I could be above you like I'm Captain Kirk
And you could be a hater roller up that dirt
(That What?)
That dirt! You know what that's worth?
A piece of bubble gum and an old bitch purse
But I keep a piece of bubble kush in the gas that I chew real fast cause I like that purt
I'm real as fuck and you faked out
Savin hoes you caked out
Put a gas mask on that fine ass burn the smoke the hoes face down
Fuck music my Jay's loud
And these other rappers shit play it down
