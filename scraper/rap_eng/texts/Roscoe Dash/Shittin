Tellem we did it
And i ain't done yet
No i ain't done yet
Noo i aynt done
And i ain't done yet
No i ain't done yet
Noo i ain't done

(Verse 1)
Top Down
Rolling in my sixty three
Same Block, Same hood like, Remember me (remember)
Lotta Money, Lotta Money to be twenty three
Police escort, like i'm dealing keys
Energy in the breeze
Like we in the trees
All my frienemeis
Still my frienemeis
On my phone
At the home like they finna eat
And that's they way i like it
Hike it Man we goin deep
Touchdown touchdown When i touchdown
Run the town, Shut it down
Like who run it now
Fuck em all day, Fuck em all night
We don't love these Hoooooooooooes
And i ain't done yet
No i ain't done yet
And i ain't done yet
No i ain't done yet
I'm Shittin

(Hook)
My Apologies

Noo i ain't done

(Verse 2)
More Toilet paper (Charmin)
You know it
Hella haters (hella haters)
I know it (know it)
Never gave a damn about em (never)
Don't i, i show it (fuck em)
We went a different route (different)
Partyhard we stick a barbie
Then we kick em out
Niggas jealous
They don't get it
You should share the freaks
And let a queen be a queen
She prepare the feast
Lotta niggas misconstrued we ain't in the streets
But i got niggas who would killem if they didn't eat
You know it
Problem with these niggas
They don't live enough
Get Enough good champagne in yaa

(Hook)
My Apologies

Noo i ain't done

(Verse 3)
I make them bitches wobble dee wobble
Heads Bobble dee Bobble (bobble)
If you relied on that ass you'd be gone by tomorrow
See My main chick bad, Ass fat like Cheetara
And i made that Kitty Purr
With my faith in good karma
I oughta, gotta be deported
I'm starting to get too important
100 thou in at my shows man that's more than tour did
No assistance so persistent too consistent to worry
Plus i'm on my 3rd ring
Three part Robert Horry
Hold the glory, like its Maury
And i know the whole story (true)
Bitches whorey
Fucked with Corey but i know the whole story (true)
Inspiration demonstration
And you couldn't afford me
Cuz in the car spouse yard house
I'm all Michael Jordan
My niggaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa (my nigga)

(Hook)
My Apologies

And i ain't done yet
No i ain't done yet
Noo i ain't done
