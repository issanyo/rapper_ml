[Intro: Derez De'Shon]
Yeeaahh.... yeahh
She say she wanna fuck a rockstar, yeahh...

[Chorus: Derez De'Shon]
She say she wanna fuck a rockstar
I bought a guitar and played her favorite song
And told her to come over and we
Rock, rock.. Rock hard! Yeaaah!
She say she my biggest fan and wanted me to band
So I took her backstage, told her bring some friends and we
Rock, rock.. Rock hard!
She say she wanna fuck a rockstar

[Verse 1: Derez De'Shon]
Well, I'm D-Bo Hendricks
Played her favorite song, took all her attention
Face full of piercings, tattoo on the titties
And she begging me to come and get it
I'm just Charlie Sheen'ing, touch down when you beaming
Xan bars and I'm leaning, [?] so loud he screaming
I just flew to Pheonix, rolling off [?]
KK or red albino, I'm so high the sky low
Twitter [?] tweet, I'm looking at her bio
Says she like Miskailo, she a freak, I told her "Â¡Vamos!"
I put that on the bible, gass, pack, propane
I ain't playing no games, switchin' off four lanes

[Chorus: Derez De'Shon]
She say she wanna fuck a rockstar
I bought a guitar and played her favorite song
And told her to come over and we
Rock, rock.. Rock hard! Yeaaah!
She say she my biggest fan and wanted me to band
So I took her backstage, told her bring some friends and we
Rock, rock.. Rock hard! Yeah!
She say she wanna fuck a rockstar

[Verse 2: Slim Dunkin]
Well, I'm Slimmy Kravis
Indy 500, ra-racing down in Indianapolis
Savage for the cabage, Macho Man Randy Savage
And she begging me to come and get it
[?] caucasian, blazing [?]
Asian bitch from overseas are far way too amazing
Kush so loud can't hear you, VVS so clear too
Whole body froze like a motherfucking igloo
Ro-Rockhard cafe, gass in the ashtray
Mounted up spaceship, taking off from NASA
Pussy so good had to take her home
We we're backstage fucking till her face was gone

[Chorus: Derez De'Shon]
She say she wanna fuck a rockstar
I bought a guitar and played her favorite song
And told her to come over and we
Rock, rock.. Rock hard! Yeaaah!
She say she my biggest fan and wanted me to band
So I took her backstage, told her bring some friends and we
Rock, rock.. Rock hard!
She say she wanna fuck a rockstar

[Verse 3: Roscoe Dash]
Maaaane
I rock out with my cock out, I do!
And she with it? Yeah!
I high schooled and she dropped out
So much for perfect attendance
She wanna party and bullshit
I'm a rockstar, man I do this
I ended in her corner pocket, no cube ball or pool stick
Tongue out, no kiss baby
V-V.I.P., no wrist band
Required, we perspire
Now she tried as fuck and need a nigga six man, right now!
Everyday she want a Marvin Gaye and Chardonnay, she do!
So we do that, then I send her on her merry way

[Chorus: Derez De'Shon]
She say she wanna fuck a rockstar
I bought a guitar and played her favorite song
And told her to come over and we
Rock, rock.. Rock hard! Yeaaah!
She say she my biggest fan and wanted me to band
So I took her backstage, told her bring some friends and we
Rock, rock.. Rock hard! Yeah
