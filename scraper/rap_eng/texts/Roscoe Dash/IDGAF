[Intro]
Pardon me, but I couldn't help but notice your eyes, those thighs
And I was wondering if you could join me as we proceed to ermm...

[Hook]
Let's get faded, have the time of our life
Smoke a lil' somethin', drink a lil' somethin'
So when we leave it's for sure
It's going down, going down, yeah wherever we go
(We don't)
We don't give a fuck about
Nothin', nothin', nothin', anything goes
We don't give a fuck about
Nothin', nothin', nothin'
We don't give a fuck about
Nothin', nothin', nothin', anything goes
We don't give a fuck about
Nothin', nothin', nothin'

[Verse]
Rules are meant to be broken, words were meant to be spoken
It's like the water park in my dream and I just wanna water slide in that ocean
I'm feeling like Wesley Pipes, better yet Ron Jeremy, why?
Cause I don't give no fuck
And she don't need to do whatever to take care of me
And it's lit, extra thick
With her nice brown hair, baby sit on this, wait
With an ass like and we drunk like this
It would be wrong if it didn't get taped
Cause we done had way, way too many shots to keep count
Somehow we ended up here, butt naked on the couch, like
What is this Monster's ball? Cause baby I can make you feel good
From the front, back, drop me off, she top me off
Ciroc must make me taste good
Said she ain't never dated, said she ain't never tried but
According to my calculations, she a mah'fucking liar

[Hook]
Let's get faded, have the time of our life
Smoke a lil' somethin', drink a lil' somethin'
So when we leave it's for sure
It's going down, going down, yeah wherever we go
We don't, we don't give a fuck about
Nothin', nothin', nothin', not a damn about
We don't give a fuck about
Nothin', nothin', nothin'
We don't give a fuck about
Nothin', nothin', nothin', anything goes
We don't give a fuck about
Nothin', nothin', nothin'

[Interlude]
See, see I knew from the firs time that I laid eyes on yuo that you was gonna be the one, and I was right

[Bridge]
Cause we done had way, way too many shots to keep count
Somehow we ended up here, butt naked on the couch
Movie or a dream, I don't wanna wake up
Cause we done had way, way too many shots to keep count
Somehow we ended up here, butt naked on the couch
Movie or a dream, I don't wanna wake up

[Hook]
Let's get faded, have the time of our life
Smoke a lil' somethin', drink a lil' somethin'
So when we leave it's for sure
It's going down, going down, yeah wherever we go
We don't, we don't give a fuck about
Nothin', nothin', nothin', not a damn about
Not a damn about
Nothin', nothin', nothin'
We don't give a fuck about
Nothin', nothin', nothin', anything goes
I don't give a fuck
Nothin', nothin', nothin'
We don't give a fuck about nothin'
