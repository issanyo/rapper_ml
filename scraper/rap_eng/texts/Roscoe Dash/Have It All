[Hook]
If there’s ever a good time
There’s never a good time for you
So I’ma sip on this good wine
And roll up some good pine for you
I said the good girls ain't no fun
The bad bitches have it all
I said the good girls ain't no fun
The bad bitches have it all

[Verse 1]
Yea good weed white wine
And you know those things
Come alive in the night time
Put them on the cheeks like
I work at a priceline
Then bitch you get left
Bitch I’m in my right mind
You is a life line
Trying to meet a millionaire
Every party take a pic
There is a million here
Make up dress
Just did a million here
Cause you and your friends
Got to be the illest here
Cause they all have extensions
She wants it without permission
Cause they know them bad bitch
They get all the attention
And once she is number one
Fuck the runner ups
See even if she got to fuck the
Runner up to get there
Big booty nice tits I’ve been there
Good quarter mile and those shoes
She got ten pair
She got it poppin like a pimp with a skank here
What a trip take it from me I’ve been there

[Hook]
If there’s ever a good time
There’s never a good time for you
So I’ma sip on this good wine
And roll up some good pine for you
I said the good girls ain't no fun
The bad bitches have it all
I said the good girls ain't no fun
The bad bitches have it all

[Verse 2]
Prada mission prada visions
She is a politician
Swallow pills swallow ills
They swallow rific
What you calling get your messing
When she ain’t around
Mistletoe kiss it slow
Like we making out nope
I don’t take her out
She just take me in
To the head in the bed
On a mercedes benz european leather
European ran for it her foreign
And she’s my latest peace
Legs like sailor V yo anime
Eat the cake clean the plate
I command a day
No I don’t beat it where the mike go
Anytime insure it geico
Bad body we ain’t talking light bulb
Crazy psycho every time is movie time
Hype mode lately you’ve been falling off
She’s been calling in a birthday suit like
She modeling n***a

[Hook]
If there’s ever a good time
There’s never a good time for you
So I’m a sip on this good wine
And roll up some good pine for you
I said the good girls ain't no fun
The bad bitches have it all
I said the good girls ain't no fun
The bad bitches have it all
If there’s ever a good time
There’s never a good time for you
So I’m a sip on this good wine
And roll up some good pine for you
I said the good girls ain't no fun
The bad bitches have it all
I said the good girls ain't no fun
The bad bitches have it all
N***a
