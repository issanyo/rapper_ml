[Roscoe Dash - Verse ]
Can I take You Down
We Can Go To 12 Rounds
You So Wet I'm a Bout To Drown
I Know You Feel Me Girl
When Nobodys Around
You Going Up And Down
We Sweating Hard It's Going Down
I Love It When You Go
So Shawty Cut The Lights Low
Come In Your Nightclub
Let Me Get in My I Can Change Your Life Mode
The Only Mission Tonight Is To Prove I Can Be The Best You Ever Had
So Shawty Won't You Bust That Pussy Open And I Tell Her Bring It Back
Shes A very Freaky Girl Doesnt Know How To Throw It Back
Got Me Standing At Attention Like Them Soldiers In Iraq
Shawty Lose Control But I Know How To Handle That

[Kalio - Verse]
First Off I'm K-K-K-Kalio
I'm Worried Bout Your Man Cause He Can't Do It Like I Can Girl
Tattoos On My Face So You Know I Got Them Band Girls
So Quit With All That Playing Girl Let's Get To What's Playing Girl
I Bet When I Finish You'll Forget Bout Your Man Girl
He Can't Touch You Like I Can He Can't Kiss You Like I Can
And When A Nigga Done She Cool Me Down Like A Fan
And When A Nigga Did it she Screaming Your The Man
But Understand That Pussy Girl I Will Evaluate
Lay Behind Your Hair While I'm Booming Out Your Brain Girl
Kalio So Strange They Shouldve Left Me on the Chain Girl
Jus Say My Name Cause I'm 2 Of Everything Girl

[P.I. - Verse]
See It Ain't Nothing Like Fuckin With A Real Nigga

So If You Feelin Freaky Baby Bring That Body Here
