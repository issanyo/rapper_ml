(Verse 1)
Getting money still
Feel like i could never lose
Tell me how it feels
I be way too lit to drive
Uber take the wheel
I been lifting way too long
Weed stronger still
I...I...I...I take trips out to the other side
They don't know, legends never die
We multiply know the ropes
I got sound sound going crazy
They taking notes
When it comes to this style shit
I'm the GOAT
Wait a minute
Whips got way too many miles on it
Fountain got way too many mouths on it
I been whipping with the styles on it
Waiting on the real, Its been awhile doing it
If I ain't in control
I just might lose my mind
But If I pull up
What they all gone say?
Pull up in that aww
What they all gone say?
