Girl you absolutely doing a damn thing (You are)
Go and work it out ‘til you pull a hamstring (go)
You fine thts for sure girl (it is)
But there’s one thing tht I think you should know girl
If I get you out here
You gonna have a real fuckin’ night girl
You might feel like a mack truck hit you
We’ll be at it all fuckin' night girl
Yeah I know what you want
Yeah I got what you need
Yeah, yeah
You gonna have a real fuckin' night girl
Yeah I know what you want
Yeah I got what you need
Yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
Baby your style, yo, I love this atmosphere
Your hips and thighs, oh my, gotta get you out of here (i do)
Them Christian Luis you got on and them tattoos (dammn)
Got me down to do whatever I have to (leggo)
With these dirty intentions of ours, in submission
I proceeded inside with pride and ambition
We went at it all night, we’re tired from repetition
Now it’s the time of our life
And it sounded like I don’t kiss it for love
I knocked that pussy out of here (i did)
I give it to you just the way you like girl
Feeling like a mack truck hit you
Now that’s a good fuckin' night girl

[Hook]
Girl you absolutely doing a damn thing (You are)
Go and work it out ‘til you pull a hamstring
You fine thts for sure girl (it is)
But there’s one thing tht I think you should know girl
If I get you out here (out of here, out of heaar)
You gonna have a real fuckin’ night girl
You might feel like a mack truck hit you (yeaah yeaah yeaahhh)
We’ll be at it all fuckin' night girl
Yeah I know what you want
Yeah I got what you need
(I got what you need girl)
Yeah, yeah
You gonna have a real fuckin' night girl
Yeah I know what you want
Yeah I got what you need
Yeah, yeah

[Verse 2]
Shit, I guarantee she like it
I fill her with excitement
She ride it like she cycling
Man I saw syrup, no words, no spices
Man, I’m Alexander Mc Queen
If they ain’t thieves, then I don’t like ‘em (Naaah)
When she rock a mic, I go hype (i do)
I drill her like I’m Bison
I contain her, I can beat her
Sprite and lean her like we fighting
You should hear the noises she make
Whenever I ride her, Roddy Piper
I can’t wipe her, I don’t write
Our words are too hot to decipher
I just give a 8 miles of the future
Word to Phifer
