Hook:
Dis feel like a win
Been wanting since I was ten
She gon feel this bank
Dancing on her skin
Pulling up in a foreign
Sitting behind the tint
Smoke all in my Ye's
Fogging up my lenses

You might think this flexing would just motivate
But they don't seem to think so
All they know is hate

Dis feel like a win
Came up another ten
Too much ain't enough
I might win again

Verse1:
I got the
I got the
I got the
I got the juice
These haters gon sit round and tell u a lie
But I tell u the truth
Just so these n**gas can see me
I might lose the roof
I done mastered my roshi
It came with a yoshi
Now bring me my soup
We known to spend them benjis
Rollie cost a chicken
Might drop another 10
Watch the water rinse
Too much ain't enough
Game ain't game enough
Bentley paint it up
That chain don't gleam enough
Rings don't ring enough
Awww I seen enough
Fuck em by the group they teaming up
Got hits I'm T'ing up
So much cash in the air
When it land on the floor
Whole team gotta sweep it up
(Hey)
Balling with no rim
Pockets never slim
They don't stand a chance
I'm jumping out the gym
Had too much to drank
Might need my liver cleansed
Might need another hand
To count up all these Ms
