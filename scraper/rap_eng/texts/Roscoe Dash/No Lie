[Verse - Roscoe]
Im tired of hearing trash, on the radio and in the clubs too
That shit be making me mad, like real niggas wanna have fun too
Who is he, he is not i, that imitation will not fly
Im like rampage on a rampage no octagon or stop sign
Now a days er’body wanna rap, id like to blame it on these jockin asz niggasz
And i get so fresh i should try out fa mah pictures
If it ain't doe then i can't fuk with ya
Cus these niggas take yo kindness for weakness to get all ya have
Flexin like they ball hard bt got injuries to the wrist and calf
You can't amount to me your like half of half
I spend half the time you got half the cash
I been out half as long you got half the swag
So compared to you ill be half his asz
Im standing on a comet so every things a far
Only way to reach my levels to reach upon a fallen star
I live my life on the edge like every days a blue moon
I got money on my car me a father time be on oovoo
He told me scoe i got yuh, just give it to em proper
And thats what we gone do till the end that’s on my momma!

I say fuck you, 'less I'm with' ya
If I take you out of the picture
I know real niggas won't miss ya
No lie, no lie, no lie-ee-I-ee-I
No lie, no lie, no lie-ee-I-ee-I
Real niggas, say word
Ye ain't never told no lie
Ye ain't never told no lie
Real niggas, say word
Ye ain't never told no lie
Ye ain't never told no lie
Real niggas, stay true
Ye ain't never told no lie
Ye ain't never told no lie
That's a thing I don't do
Nah I just do it for the niggas
That are trying to see a million 'fore they die
Whatsup

[Verse2 - Roscoe BONUS]
Well i do it for my niggas in the chi
Twenty twelve po pimpin smoking hay like do or die
I was far down at the bottom thought i never woulda got up
I was brought up by a lot of top shottas and cold robbers
Who, dont give a fuk
Quit bitchin and pour up
On so many papers i should get a folder but no sir
Im out of my mind, in control of the mid and lows
And when im high i suppose i should grow up
Im just killing these hoes then i bury em all in a row
No lie-ei-ei this you already know
Sacrificially reprimanding and slaying instrumentals
Cuz this that no lie remix layziielay and roscoe yup
