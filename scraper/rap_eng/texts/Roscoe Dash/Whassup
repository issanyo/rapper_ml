[Hook: Roscoe Dash]
I got bitches in my grotto like tomorrow's New Years Eve
Popping bottle after bottle they gon' swallow on they knees
And I can't help but to facilitate
When they need to get away, but they coming anyway
Pick it up, drop it down for me
Hold up, wait for the beat, wiggle it 'round for me
They say that when you on the grind it's going down
So it's always going down cause I keep another round 'round me what's up

[Verse 1: Roscoe Dash]
Bitches on bitches, I did it
Bitches ain't God, he's my witness
Comin' they come to my senses
Come when I want to - consistent
When I can't decide which one I want I just take them all
It was Fat girl at the club
No slack you gotta uh
Drop it down, talking about
Smash, you know
Whoa, bars, Mars, Bruno
She listen to Drake all the time when we fuck I don't hate on it
It's all motivation she on it she know how to wait on it, wait on it lord
I learn it from her do it to the death when I bought me a grotto
I'm the man of my city
Get wind in my city like I was born in Chicago
I don't got much time so I only fuck bitches who drink macchiatos (espresso)
I keep them hoes moving like como de yamos [?] I do

[Verse 2: Waka Flocka Flame]
She call me her getaway that's why my shorty fuck with me
We don't do the U.S.A we only flyin' overseas
Bottles sparkles you know me don't buy it that shit came for free
Drop the top girl, feel the breeze
I'm feelin' her she fuck with me
[Hold up] Execute the pussy, guillotine
Next stop to the Philippines where she and me fulfill her dreams
BSM you know my team
On prescription pills and lean
Shawty every night's a party celebrate like new years eve
Waist real little huh
Ass real fat uh
Hair down her back
I can see your booty crack
The way you drop it to the floor, girl bring it right back
Everything's on me

[Hook]
