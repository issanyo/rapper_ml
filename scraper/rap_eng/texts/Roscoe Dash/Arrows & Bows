[Intro: Hefna Gwap]
You my valentine every day
And I mean what I say
You my valentine every day
Arrows and bows

[Verse 1: Roscoe Dash & Hefna Gwap]
Cupid hit the right persons when he hit you and I
You be the right verses lookin' like cursive, no ink: you my type
And I love to push the right buttons when I see you at night
Fuck dartboards, like chalkboards I'm drawing you with my unborn
And I'm really missing the fuck out of you, so many things that I wanna do
So many places that I need to [?] on you, fo' sho, that's like everyday
I hit [?], spin back
It be hard for her to look back, we get all them drugs and mix that
Can't wait for you to throw that back on me, when I touchdown home
Cause you keep your mouth where the [?] at
And I know you came [?], blowin' up my phone
Lately I've been wanting that like Hennessey in my Cognac

[Pre-Hook: Roscoe Dash]
In case you didn't know there's been several things
That I wanna do but hey, none like you plus there's
Many things that I want with you, and I know
I don't need to think (arrows and bows)

[Hook: Hefna Gwap]
You my valentine every day
Every day, every day
Every day, every day, every day
Arrows and bows

[Verse 2: Roscoe Dash]
Arrows and bows, diamonds and roses
Camels and toes's, you know, I
I want you, I hit 'em with that, hit back
It be hard for her to get back
I just sit back, get that, ahh
My nigga we rollin', we on a roll an' nobody knows it
She's striking my favorite poses, take that dicky in doses
Chocolate, opposite off in this often this murder scene
Love out of this world so you  she [?]
She just curved the team [?]
All the joy it brings, it's like poisonin', it's to die for
She the total package, ass-ass backwards, ass crazy ain't it, that's the only ass I have time for
I ain't lyin' boy, 99 boy, that's the many times we done did it
And even after that's said and done I'm down to go and she wit' it

[Pre-Hook: Roscoe Dash]
In case you didn't know there's been several things
That I wanna do but hey, none like you plus there's
Many things that I want with you, and I know
I don't need to think (arrows and bows)

[Hook: Hefna Gwap]
You my valentine every day
Every day, every day
Every day, every day, every day
Arrows and bows

[Pre-Hook: Roscoe Dash]
In case you didn't know there's been several things
That I wanna do but hey, none like you plus there's
Many things that I want with you, and I know
I don't need to think (arrows and bows)

[Hook: Hefna Gwap]
You my valentine every day
Every day, every day
Every day, every day, every day
Arrows and bows
