[Chorus]:
Dirty thoughts all in my mind
I just wanna take you home
And I can’t even lie
Girl you got it goin’ on and
Girl I’m in the mood to do some freaky thangs to you

Shawty say she fiendin' and she want it right now
She buss that pussy open and I get the sap out
Girl I’ll show you things you never seen befo’
So come on

She want it on the counter and she want it right now
I put her in submissive till I make her tapout
Girl I'll show you things you never seen befo’
So come on

[Verse 1]:
(Damn!) Shawty what yo name is
I swear you started lead the way
Cause girl your body’s dangerous
Tell me what your aim is
Better yet what’s your number
Got a sweet wet room and covers
That I really want you under
Girl ain’t no time for slumber (No!)
Girl you rainin’ let me thunder
I’m the captain of the ship
Girl I put it down like no other
She’s fiendin' and I’m her drugs
She’s addicted and all in love
She’s my socket and I’m her plug
She’s the one who got all of these haterz

[Chorus]:
Dirty thoughts all in my mind
I just wanna take you home
And I can’t even lie
Girl you got it goin’ on and
Girl I’m in the mood to do some freaky thangs to you

Shawty say she fiendin' and she want it right now
She buss that pussy open and I get the sap out
Girl I’ll show you things you never seen befo’
So come on

She want it on the counter and she want it right now
I put her in submissive till I make her tapout
Girl I'll show you things you never seen befo’
So come on
