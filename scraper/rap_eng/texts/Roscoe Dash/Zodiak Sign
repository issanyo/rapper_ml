She's hotter than summer time a hundred times
I underline her undefine
Some the time I rupture spine and stamp it
So she knows is mine, feels like we livin for a purpose
Now I donate 'cause this the type of love you want to last forever
Oh, is so complicated 'cause all the winner obligated
I also feel the need to spoil and over compensated
Contemplate it but it's never concentrated
Just to snug it or cut it but it's a please it when you want
Know, what time it is
Late night you ain't sleeping alone
Those can't get sober whenever
But those things you hear about in fairy tales it's so whatever
Happinessin' don't exist without understanding
Plus our business is so vivid when we under planning

Pre Chorus:
Girl I don't wanna waste no time
Cuz I already know what's on your mind
You know, tonight the moon and the stars are aligned
So I've been looking for my zodiak sign
Talking about

Aquarius, Scorpio, Cancer, Leo
Gemini, Taurus, Pisces, Virgo
Libra, Aries, Capricorn, Sag
Tonight somebody getting smashed
Aquarius, Scorpio, Cancer, Leo
Gemini, Taurus, Pisces, Virgo

Tell me how Aquarius storm could trigger a fire alarm
I'm on my para flow take over your boat
Rock it back and forth, back in forth
That's her favorite song sex drive over time
I get my Kobe Bryant on
Girl you're sweeter than a berry
That ass a thousand carry, got me one to make you feel good
Girl Halle Berry
And we should make a movie the house the Jacuzzi the bathroom
My tattoo ain't saint to find that pussy
Do it anyway she wanna, our loves like California
That's a five hour flight
She hot n cold pure pneumonia
The way I put it on her she needs a substitution
I tear that ass up, can't get enough shout out to cupid

Pre Chorus:
Girl I don't wanna waste no time
Cuz I already know what's on your mind
You know, tonight the moon and the stars are aligned
So I've been looking for my zodiak sign
