[Verse 1]
Awww she know when she walkin'
To pay attention like she mighta got Hoffman
Way more better, ass way more fatter
Even got the bitches drippin' like faucets
She buzzed as hell, gets high as hell
That's ass heat and I'm tryin' to tell
Lots a niggas done tried and failed but
I got it yeah, I got it, yeah
I ordered three for me, three for her
She wanna leave with me, she wanna be secure
It's been a while since she took a trip on the wild side
'Til she hopped in with a real nigga hot side
Tell me where you want it
She reached in and said "where you want me"?
