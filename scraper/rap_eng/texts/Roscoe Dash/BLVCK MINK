[Hook]:
Can't take too long when ya getting ready
Money got too long
Pockets getting heavy
What did I do wrong
Besides get it steady
When a nigga get wrong
We get super petty

Diamond link
Black mink
No shirt
Awww I come clean
Pink slips
I don't think they ready
I been Turnt
Aww don't be forgetty

[Verse 1]
I ain't really for the drama
Shout out to my baby mama
I don't pay her not a dollar
Bitch I'm Turnt
Baby rocking baby Pradas
Spending saving not a dollar
Even tho I know I oughta
Bitch I'm Earnt
Stepping in Giuseppe everytime that I'm stepping out
Just in case a nigga wanna know what that check about
Saying Scoe now, now, now
Let's not be disrespectful now
Still got that shit that make em spin they neck around
I just F around but I'm G doe
I'm a bald head no Kemo
You like Shaq at the free throw
They like damn son
We really need those
Bunch of bad bitches they with me tho
Tryna take a shot I got D tho
Finna slide up in it like a ski slope
Wine and dine she want meatloaf

Still shut it down still shut this bitch down
Still buss it down still smoke a whole pound
Still ill
Still will
Nigga we just still
Rich as hell without a deal

Can't take too long when ya getting ready

Besides get it steady
When a nigga get wrong

[Verse 2]
I done came along way ain't that the truth
I be staying out the way kicking cool
I gotta a million other things I can do
But today imma sang it just for you
On a roll like a coal train
Can't fold like I don't fold things
Spending paper from my old ways
Diamonds dancing like soul train
I been fly and high soul plane
I might join Trinidad and gold gang
Cuz all my shit 100 no change
I got that work nigga no slaves
And I still

Still shut it down still shut this bitch down
Still buss it down still smoke a whole pound
Still ill
Still will
Nigga we just still
Rich as hell without a deal
