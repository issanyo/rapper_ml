(Verse 1)
Yeaaaahhhhh...
You keep causing static in our connection
You keep causing drama, I need protection
Always cause a scene
Ain't nothing special
You ain't been a clean case, girl you an infection
No interest in a team just interceptions
All that yelling hurt my ears
Like a bad song selection
You'll never keep a real nigga
This is my suggestion
You should major in BS
And make it a profession
I know it ain't me, its on you
You ain't 100
We expect that shit from you
Its a whole lotta girls
Playing the games that you do
But this ain't about them
Shorty this about you

(Hook)
Oh yeah we know ya type
We know ya type
I know ya type 2x
We know ya type 2x
Type to come around and try to get over
Tell all type of lies but a thrill nigga know ya
We know ya type 2x
I know ya type 2x
We know ya type 2x
Type to come around and try to get over
Tell all type of lies but a thrill nigga know ya

(Verse 2)
Real Nigga since day one
Still down with my A1's
Getting loose leaf and some
And i keep some for her tantrums
Head and shoulders, No Dandruff
Might drop the top, i might tan something
Must not know where my clan from
We gone get ours like and ones
When i land come
We plan something
I bang that ass like a band drum
Like my anthem
You and one of your friends
Who down to go and pretend
Who gone text every weekend
Tryna save more than she spend
Like that counts as a win

Bridge
Awww Goddamn
We know ya type 2x
But her head good, I play along
I know you like

(Verse 3)
When i spend dough so i spend it all
Pass it off like Chris paul
This song ain't meant to diss y'all
Just to let know why we get along

(Hook)
Oh yeah we know ya type
We know ya type
I know ya type 2x
We know ya type 2x
Type to come around and try to get over
Tell all type of lies but a thrill nigga know ya
We know ya type 2x
I know ya type 2x
We know ya type 2x
Type to come around and try to get over
Tell all type of lies but a thrill nigga know ya
