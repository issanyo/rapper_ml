[Chorus]
I swag, you don't (You don't)
I can have any bitch I want (I can)
I'm rich, you broke (Sorry)
I eat Benihanas when I want (I do)
I flex, I'm shinin' (Shinin')
Import all my diamonds (Please)
Boy I'm on that fly shit
Yeah I'm auto pilot, 3, 2, 1
3, 2, 1, lift off, 3, 2, 1, lift off
3, 2, 1, lift off, 3, 2, 1, lift off
Boy I'm on that fly shit
Yeah I'm autopilot

[Verse]
I wake up and piss excellence (I do)
I exceeded all estimates (Yeah)
I'm sky high and I'm extra lit (Woah)
I make 1st place look effortless
As long as I keep thinkin of this clever shit
There's way more money that's left to get (cha-ching)
I keep riding around in expensive shit (Skrrr)
Credit cards unlimited (Go)
And we flexin (Yeah)
I'm out of this world, no reception (Yeah)
2020, no Jetsons (Yeah)
Campaign, this ain't no election
No stressin (Naa)
Fuck y'all predictions
All models missing
Everything's a hit
That's called precision
They ain't got no choice but to get in line with
The most unconditioned autopilot

[Chorus]
I swag, you don't (You don't)
I can have any bitch I want (I can)
I'm rich, you broke (Sorry)
I eat Benihanas when I want (I do)
I flex, I'm shinin (Shinin')
Import all my diamonds (Plea)
Boy I'm on that fly shit
Yeah I'm auto pilot, 3, 2, 1
3, 2, 1, lift off, 3, 2, 1, lift off
3, 2, 1, lift off, 3, 2, 1, lift off
Boy I'm on that fly shit
Yeah I'm autopilot
