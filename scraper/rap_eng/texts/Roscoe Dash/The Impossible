And let it air dry on the stairs
The stairs, the stairs, the stairs, the stairs
And someone tell me what’s the use for the bed
When you up in the air, the air, the air

She took the whole thang, she took the whole thang
And now I’m asking, is you straight
She said yeah quit talking boy switch up your tempo
She had her right backs, I'm the King Sacramento
And she loves it, she loves it, she loves it
When I stand up in that thang
