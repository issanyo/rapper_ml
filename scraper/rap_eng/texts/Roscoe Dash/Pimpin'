Hoe

[Verse 1 - Spiff Roussell]
Let a nigga breathe
I was fuckin' on the low
She wouldn't let a nigga leave
Nigga please
Got a brother overseas
If I ever fell off, say we got hundred G's
Jeeze
Phil Knight, on the keys
Called her over for the night
Put her right on her knees (damn)
Tradition, keep a bitch up in the kitchen
Keep a bitch that keep my robe
Keep a bitch up in detention
I'm pimpin'
Man ya'll better pay attention
Got some R&B bitches
Got some hoes that I can't mention
Man, ya'll better pay attention
I'm pimpin'
(I'm gone)

[Chorus]
I'm pimpin'
I be pimpin' hoes
I be sippin'
I be, tippin' fo's
I'm pimpin'
I be pimpin' hoes
I be sippin'
I be, sippin' fo's
I'm pimpin'
I'm pimpin'
I'm pimpin'
I'm pimpin'
I'm pimpin'
I'm pimpin'
I'm pimpin'
I'm pimpin' hoes

[Verse 2 - Roscoe Dash 2.0]
I been pimpin' since pimpin' hoes
I been gettin' high since 'Get Low'
No limp doe
What handicap
Sit in strip club and hand me that, paper
Can't save 'em, no caper
Fresh suit and shape up
Ain't a, nigga like me
She untie these Nikes
I be somewhere that ya never been
Fuck her once, we never ever have sex again
Headache no Excedrin, et cetera
New chauffeur for every car
She grab that dick from very far, very far
And this the same for every car
That's luxury and spacious
The champagne it came wit is ancient
New waves, Calvin Cambridge
The bitch don't ask what my name is
Hoe I'm, pimpin', pimpin'
Sickest nigga runnin' man you better pay attention

[Chorus]
I'm pimpin'
I be pimpin' hoes
I be sippin'
I be, tippin' fo's
I'm pimpin'
I be pimpin' hoes
I be sippin'
I be, sippin' fo's
I'm pimpin'
I'm pimpin'
I'm pimpin'
I'm pimpin'
I'm pimpin'
I'm pimpin'
I'm pimpin'
I'm pimpin' hoes
