[Hook: August Alsina]
She say 5 for the table, 10 for the lap
25 a song if we take it to the back
And I said “Damn, tell me what would you do for the rack?”
And she said “Damn, I don’t know if I should answer that”
Because she work hard for that money, work hard for that cash
Work hard for that money work hard for that cash
Work hard, so she twerk hard, she love shaking that ass
She work hard for that money, work hard for that cash

[Verse 1: August Alsina]
Girl, you see how many bottles that we popped, so don’t stop dropping that ass, down up, down up, jiggle that back
Drop it to the floor, girl, make that ass clap, if we take it to the back for a stack, it’s a wrap
And you know that, you love hearing that real shit
I love the way that them heels fit and the way they’re making that ass sit
And your outfit is the dopest, now take it off, stay focused
Got a tattoo of your stage name, them other niggas don’t notice
You killing hoes with your pole tricks, you work hard or get no tips
You ball hard, I’ve got more whips and a drug dealer got more chips

[Pre-Hook: August Alsina]
And I can’t, I won’t stop staring at your body cause it looks so good on the stage
Girl it's amazing, that’s why you’ve got every nigga in here paying

And she said “Damn, I don’t know if I should answer that”
Because she work hard for that money, work hard for that cash
Work hard for that money work hard for that cash
Work hard, so she twerk hard, she love shaking that ass
She work hard for that money, work hard for that cash

[Verse 2: Roscoe Dash]
New day, new money, more than often
Nowadays my lifestyle is more than costly
Them nights at the Saint, drunk and so exhausted
No for me, girl for you, girl I’m more than bossing
But girl you’re stunning, Stone Cold Steve Austin
What a hell of a catch, Calvin Johnson
You belong on the cover, should give thanks to your mother
Man, need time to recover if we go to the buzzer
Good to know I’m a drummer, fuck it then I’mma beat it
Thought she was into the other but she was happy to meet it
So she wrote down the number in case I wanted to keep it
But I decided to pass, on the count I ain't need it
Some would call it conceited, but I call it original
Dark and spicy, that line was subliminal
Call me Mr. Clutch, put me in when it’s pivotal
Watch me kill it and leave it, I’m a hell of a criminal

[Pre-Hook: August Alsina]
And I can’t, I won’t stop staring at your body cause it looks so good on the stage
Girl it's amazing, that’s why you’ve got every nigga in here paying
