[Intro: Ali]
I wanna know what really turns you on
And I wanna know if I can be the one
She never tells me no, just hit it and I go
Even though I met little shawty, like, three months ago
Whenever I'm in town, she always comes around
She say, "Ali, I need you, so just come and beat it down"

[Hook: Roscoe Dash 2.0]
She say she wanna see me, but know she got a man
She say he put it down, but he can't do it like I can
So I'ma put it down, we both go for twelve rounds
She say she wanna do it everytime I come in town
Oooh-ah-ooohh, oooh-ah-ooohh (I got her screaming like)
Oooh-ah-ooohh, oooh-ah-ooohh (I got her sounding like)
Oooh-ah-ooohh, oooh-ah-ooohh (every time I put it down)
Oooh-ah-ooohh, oooh-ah-ooohh

[Verse 1: Strap]
I got hoes for days
These hoes know the game
Jordan from [?], Tyana in Savannah
And then my week is scheduled when I'm down in Alabama
Monday, it's Morgan, Tuesday, it's Tiffany
Wednesday, I'm wasted at the W with Whitney
Oh, oh, owww
Making love all in her mouth
Shawty say she loves to go down
And she's the type to never spit it out
Okay cool, let's do it
I'ma lay back and relax and you put on some music

[Hook: Roscoe Dash 2.0]
She say she wanna see me, but know she got a man
She say he put it down, but he can't do it like I can
So I'ma put it down, we both go for twelve rounds
She say she wanna do it everytime I come in town
Oooh-ah-ooohh, oooh-ah-ooohh (I got her screaming like)
Oooh-ah-ooohh, oooh-ah-ooohh (I got her sounding like)
Oooh-ah-ooohh, oooh-ah-ooohh (every time I put it down)
Oooh-ah-ooohh, oooh-ah-ooohh

[Verse 2: Quez]
I will never ever fall in love
Why do fools fall in love?
I will never ever fall in love
She hit me up, but she ain't really looking for no love
Whenever I'm in town, I'm chilling at her house
Her man is not around, so I made her say her vowels
A-E-I-O-U, baby, how are you?
Girl, I'm with my team, so just let us slide through
She said her man ain't doing it right
So she called me up, say, "What you doing tonight?"
I say, "You, you, and your roommate, too"
Because I'm with Roscoe, Ali, and Strap da Fool, fool

[Hook: Roscoe Dash 2.0]
She say she wanna see me, but know she got a man
She say he put it down, but he can't do it like I can
So I'ma put it down, we both go for twelve rounds
She say she wanna do it everytime I come in town
Oooh-ah-ooohh, oooh-ah-ooohh (I got her screaming like)
Oooh-ah-ooohh, oooh-ah-ooohh (I got her sounding like)
Oooh-ah-ooohh, oooh-ah-ooohh (every time I put it down)
Oooh-ah-ooohh, oooh-ah-ooohh

[Verse 3: Roscoe Dash 2.0]
Hello, shawty, how you doing?
Damn, girl you bad like you starring in a movie
Matter of fact, scratch that, we should make a movie
An action-packed flick, going ham in a jacuzzi
Ooh-wee, yeah
She love the way I do it while I'm pulling on her hair
We started on the stairs, ended everywhere
I'm like, "You got a man", she like, "Who the fuck cares?"
So I'm like, "Okay cool", she wetter than the pool
We did the kamasutra and she breaking all the rules
She go up, down, up, down, legs up, touchdown
She say she wanna do it every time a nigga touchdown

[Hook: Roscoe Dash 2.0]
She say she wanna see me, but know she got a man
She say he put it down, but he can't do it like I can
So I'ma put it down, we both go for twelve rounds
She say she wanna do it everytime I come in town
Oooh-ah-ooohh, oooh-ah-ooohh (I got her screaming like)
Oooh-ah-ooohh, oooh-ah-ooohh (I got her sounding like)
Oooh-ah-ooohh, oooh-ah-ooohh (every time I put it down)
Oooh-ah-ooohh, oooh-ah-ooohh
