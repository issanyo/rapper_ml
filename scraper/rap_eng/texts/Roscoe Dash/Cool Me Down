[Intro]
Cut it up
C'mon c'mo
Roscoe

[Chorus]
Shawty ima baller, a big shot caller
If I give em 10 digits best believe I'm gon' call her
Shots of tall glass of water
I'm hotter than a sauner
I think i'm feelin' for her, so shawty come cool me down
(I'm burnin up) Cool me down
Shawty come cool me down
Cool me down me down, me down, me down

[Verse 1]
Mrs Aquafina, hi it's nice to meet ya
Been standin' cross the room, admirin' ya feature
And all i'm thinkin' bout is the things that I wanna teach ya
And ima say I think you're a very exotic creature
Wanna do some freaky things to you
Make a name for you
If you was a dollar girl I'd make some change for you
You was sent from heaven let me be ya angel food
And we gon' do everything we was made to do

Let it go, I may ball a lot but that is not my ammo
Tryna get some air from between your lips
Like my nickname was Nintendo
I'm going for the first so you know that my team don't end slow
I'm all over your hard drive just call me new window

[Chorus]
Shawty ima baller, a big shot caller
If I give em 10 digits best believe I'm gon' call her
Shots of tall glass of water
I'm hotter than a sauner
I think i'm feelin' for her, so shawty come cool me down
(I'm burnin up) Cool me down
Shawty come cool me down
Cool me down me down, me down, me down

[Verse 2]
Oh my god! She's bad
She's hotter than California and I really want her ass
So I grabbed her by the hand asked her if she had a man
She said "mmm I don't know", so I said let's make plans
And she is hotter than an oven, I am cooler than a fan
She never been a groupie so you can't call her a fan
I be droppin' bands like my name was no hands
She cool a nigga down and she do it with no hands
I'm the man
She call my phone like C-C-C-C-Calio
Don't want it on your bed so just meet me on your patio
So I hit the patio, gladly hoe
St-st-st-stopped by then I passed a hoe
I'm sicker than your average though

[Chorus]
Shawty ima baller, a big shot caller
If I give em 10 digits best believe I'm gon' call her
Shots of tall glass of water
I'm hotter than a sauner
I think i'm feelin' for her, so shawty come cool me down
(I'm burnin up) Cool me down
Shawty come cool me down
Cool me down me down, me down, me down

[Verse 3]
I'm burnin' up, hotter than the sauna
My persona got me blowin' where I wanna nigga
Ten digits best she call damn that glass tall
I'm talkin' five star bitch that's a bad broad
And I'm a bad boy, and I like bad things
Been a baller bet I give your bitch hood dreams
Now come and cool me down
My checka loose brown
We passin' fruity around, she wet enough to fuckin' drown
That ass nice and round
I tell her scrub the ground
She throw it back and I catch it no pitcher's now
Boy I'm all turned up gon' and mix me down
That's two 2's and a nine but I'm inked down

[Chorus]
Shawty ima baller, a big shot caller
If I give em 10 digits best believe I'm gon' call her
Shots of tall glass of water
I'm hotter than a sauner
I think i'm feelin' for her, so shawty come cool me down
(I'm burnin up) Cool me down
Shawty come cool me down
Cool me down me down, me down, me down
