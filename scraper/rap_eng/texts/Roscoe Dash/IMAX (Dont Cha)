You wanna have fun
I’m a take two
But you gotta take one
This gonna get you lose girl
Put it on your tongue
It’s only the beginning girl
And the night is still young
Yea you only live once
Tomorrow we going to do it
Everything under the sun
You don’t want to stop
Once your body feel numb
The grade A shit
Got too much will get you sprung
Oh I want to keep the light on let me see it
I don’t mean to lie I don’t mean it
So turn the camera on I’m trying to HD it
My life can guarantee it like you need it

[Verse 2]
Box office said to the roof
I’m feeling all made a bus fair
Like baby girl you looking cruel
Pulled up in a Bentley GT BB
For a girl on the road
Paparazzi taking pictures
Of hoes with your fat baby booty
Ain’t yours so true
Now that you know it
You got it you show it any way possible
You seeking you dropping and killing
You do the kim possible
You know it
They offer you everything possible
To get on top of you but you don’t follow through
Telling you take them cause killing and stepping
Take those chips out like you know it
Money we blow it
Grandma yea yea and they know it
Don't even report it
Check those tens they going to show it
In the VIP loaded smell like a rodent
She going to do it for sure cause she
Already know it time to go homie
Now you going like you know it
Lil n***a
