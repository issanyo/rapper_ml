[Verse 1: Roscoe Dash]
She's hotter than
Summer time A hundred times
I underline her undefined
Some the time I rupture spine and stamp it so she knows it's mine
Feels like we're livin' for a purpose now don't it
Cause this the type of love you want to last forever
Ohh it's so complicated, cause although we're not obligated
I often feel the need to spoil and over compensate it
Contemplate it, but it's never concentrated on
Just a snuggie a cuddy buddy to please you
When you want, know what time it is
Late nights you hate sleepin' alone
Those can get solved wheneva'
But those things you hear about em'
Fairy tales are so whateva'
Happy endings don't exist without understandin'
Plus our visits are so vivid
When we under plan it

[Hook: Lloyd]
Girl I don't wanna waste no time
Cause I already know what's on ya mind
And know
Tonight the moon and the stars are aligned
So I'll be lookin' for my Zodiac Sign
Talkin' bout
Aqua, Scorpio, Cancer, Leo
Gemini, Taurus, Pisces, Virgo
Libra, Ares, Capricorn, Sag
Tonight somebody gettin' smashed
Aqua, Scorpio, Cancer, Leo
Gemini, Taurus, Pisces, Virgo
Libra, Ares, Capricorn, Sag
Tonight somebody gettin' smashed

[Verse 2:Roscoe Dash]
I be hidin', quiet storm
Could trigger a fire alarm
Im on my pirate flow
Takeova' ya boat
Rock it back and forth, back and forth
Dats her favorite song, sex drive
Overtime I get my Kobe Bryant on
Girl ya sweeter den a berry
Dat ass and thighs you carry
Got me wantin to make you feel
Good girl Halle Berry
And we should make a movie
The house, the car, jacuzzi
The bathroom I tattoo and sanctify that pussy
Do it anyway she wanna
Her love's like California
That's a five hour flight
She hot and cold that's pure phenomena
The way I put it on her
She need a substitution
I tear that ass up can't get enough
Shout out to cupid

[Hook: Lloyd]
