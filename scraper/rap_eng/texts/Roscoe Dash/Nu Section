(Verse 1)
I'm still ridin' round with yo main bitch
Ballin' hard, come from Cambridge
Still waking out everyday
Get right back on that same shit
That's what the fuck I wanna do
Drive the same cars that stunters do
I wanna do, but I'd rather do what you wanna do
I'm in front of you, what you gon' do?
Get money and bitches at the same time
Only got a bitch on face time
Nah, i ain't talkin' bout face time
Finn the time mufucka really ain't mine
I ain't lyin', you can ask the niggas I been with
They make note cuz they seen it
So many bottles makin' nigga sea sick
So hot, wear pair of (?)
Still get way in yo ass is greasy
Lax wait long, Norwegian
Still askin' how much my features
Since No Hands I don't really need it
Ain't no sense in make believin'
I used to have a dream
But those who were way back before I achieved it

(Hook)
I got so many hoes in my section, I'm flexin'
What's that Nu that's on like that?
I got so many hoes in my section, I'm flexin'
What's that Nu that's on like that?
We always been gettin' on like that
Everything in mine is turnt up, whachya tryna say?
You ain't on one song you can break it down
I just spend the money, You gettin round in all kinda ways
So remember what I begin now

(Verse 2)
I got so many covers in my bank account
And now in my deposit gotta take some out
Bitches greet me with their faces out
And they come amount of two, they come flag and fall
Fuck niggas really be hatin' now
Use the bus, I'm really up for debatin' now
I Got deep breath, I'm breakin' out
Peace here, you take this out
Funny niggas, Dave Chappelle
My name gon' weigh like a major scale
You always topple ova a major fail
And whoever told you dip put this ? (crime don't sell?)
My niggas out of GC made betta
Ain't neva goin' back like Sam Cassell
We all in Jamaica gettin' tanned as hell
Spiff,Ronnie, chase the wheel
First KD keep flyin' Kale
Bitches, liquor, time to kill
(?) I flex, my mind is real
Got checks on deck like summer sell
True nigs, more? Yes, and time will tell
Y'all hands outside, y'all toppers killed
I am 23 with a money tree and everything I want right in front of me

(Hook)
I got so many hoes in my section, I'm flexin'
What's that Nu that's on like that?
I got so many hoes in my section, I'm flexin'

We always been gettin' on like that
Everything in mine is turnt up, whachya tryna say?
You ain't on one song you can break it down
I just spend the money, You gettin round in all kinda ways
So remember what I begin now

(Bridge)
Imagine what I be gettin', who the fuck is you kiddin'?
Imagine what I be gettin', who the fuck is you kiddin'?
Imagine what I be gettin', who the fuck is you kiddin'?!
Imagine what I be gettin', who the fuck is you kiddin'??!?
