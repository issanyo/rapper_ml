[Chorus: Roscoe Dash]
She says she want a nigga that will buy her nice things
A getaway where he don’t wanna do the right things
I told her she ain't never met a nigga like me
And when she bust it open, I send it right back
Give it to you ways that you ain't never seen girl
I'ma put it on you 'til you scream girl
Come and let me show what I mean girl
I make you cream girl, I bet you like that

[Verse 1: Roscoe Dash]
She said go dumb and I do that, put it in a suplex
Work it out broke two sweats, doggystyle like two pets
Baby I'm a nuisance, use it to it's useless
Send you right back to your man
Just to let him know he's juice-less
Don't mean to brag but I'm on it right now
She like the way the paint switches, peach to scarlet right now
I walk in the room, well it started right now
I left her house, she do is call and say I want it right now
Been on the top two years, two summers (yeah)
'bout time someone took me under (yeah)
And who better then your bitch? (go)
That's my favorite girl, no wonder
You feed her breakfast, lunch, and supper (yeah)
I text her, meet her, fuck her (yeah)
You kiss her at the end of the night 'cause you’re a sucker, hah

[Chorus: Roscoe Dash]
She says she want a nigga that will buy her nice things
A getaway where he don’t wanna do the right things
I told her she ain't never met a nigga like me
And when she bust it open, I send it right back
Give it to you ways that you ain't never seen girl
I'ma put it on you 'til you scream girl
Come and let me show what I mean girl
I make you cream girl, I bet you like that

[Verse 2: Derez De'Shon]
I'm D-Bo, you Felicia, baggin' bitches, yeah I feed her
Two hundred dollars for that pussy and two bands for my sneakers
Man she face down all in the pillow, ass all in the air
I fuck her like she never been, then slap her and pull her hair
DDT that pussy, pin up, she tap out
Roll it out on some dice, watch how quick she crap out
I like bad bitch with a good coochie, bad job I'ma pull her Gucci
Kick out on express way, Chris Brown, throw the deuces
She like it, she love it, she suck it, she fuck it
I kiss it, I lick it, she pop it, I bust
D Dash, he smash, all four, no knee pads
She glad, but he mad, she love me with her freak ass

[Chorus: Roscoe Dash]
She says she want a nigga that will buy her nice things
A getaway where he don’t wanna do the right things
I told her she ain't never met a nigga like me
And when she bust it open, I send it right back
Give it to you ways that you ain't never seen girl
I'ma put it on you 'til you scream girl
Come and let me show what I mean girl
I make you cream girl, I bet you like that
