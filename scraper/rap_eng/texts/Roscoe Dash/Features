[Hook]
Go!
I can’t help but off em man
It’s true
Off is very often in your crew
I’ve been gettin’ money more than you
Can’t talk to me
Can’t talk to me

[Verse 1]
Wheels go round on the runway
We’re gonna have lots of fun day
I just made a 100 grand
No uncle sam on the monday
B**** I get it don’t wait for it
For heart no wait for it
Make it rain like a rain forest
Burning things is the thing
But I ain’t for it
Celebrate my birthday
Lit a cake for it
Where the F****  is Rihanna at?
No nervous shot, disturbia
You narcissist
Can’t stomach that
Hand it off when i’m running back
From Belina hurt tummy fat (yeah)
I was always a mob
F**k still a mob
Mufukka gah damn
I ain’t no turning back(yeah)
P***y ,party ,broke, niggas watchin’
Ain’t it just like a nigga
Ain’t it darling pan begging palm
When you take a break you fall enough(yeah)
I’ve been getting money all along
Kick back, speed of [?]
In a morning what is sexy puss
Put that real s**t echelon
B*****s  real shity call enough
B*****s lick d*** balls n’ all
But to my headache Tylenol
I know my nope not at all
If I could I will sign em all
But I keep the hoes in check
No sweat ( yep)
Signin’ off your name(yeah)
Lil nigga

[Hook]
I care but often merely true
Off is very often in your crew
I’ve been gettin’ money more than you
Can’t talk to me
Can’t talk to me
Your talk is cheap and I ain’t hard to see (We know)
I got a lot to see
I got a foreign visa
I go
My apologies I got a lot of features I don’t
(Yeaaahhh)


[Verse 3]
Mic check this is sound boy
Ok good coz I’m gone boy
I’m so on my
So nobody’s saw a s**t that I’m on boy
I’m the man you look [?] boy
So collected and calm boy
And I’m rollin’ to with that convoy
As I grip the game on my palm boi
And I’m always to the max
No minimum killin’ em
And am kinda many on fillin’ em up
With a little some
Little bit of feather em
Whatever they want coz they tell me
Nothing’s really on my budget
I’m Steve Jobs to this rap s**t
A bee asked on my chalice
My hand and the wonder wand
Down in the wonderland
Knockin honey jack back with Alice
My team on my back like I met this
(yeah) my steez on some Dijon
I ain’t talkin like a salad
Everytime I spit I got these other
Motherf*****r doing face palms
Similar to Dj Cali
I made a good dream for my nightmare
Right here ahead of everyone else by lightyears
My kindness sake witness it’s mercy
Coz my chair is a throne
So do i care? No, I don’t

I can’t help but off em man
