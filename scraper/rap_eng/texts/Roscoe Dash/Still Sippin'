I'm Sippin' I'm still Sippin'
Tryna kick me out the bar
Boy you must be tripping hold up
I'm Sippin' I'm still Sippin'
How the hell I'm supposed to leave
Without all these women hold up
I'm Sippin' I'm still Sippin'
Nah don't be mad
Cuz I'm out here living hold up
I'm Sippin' I'm still Sippin'
Tryna kick me off the bar
But I'm still Sippin'

Walk thru the door
Tryna empty up the bar
When I talk to your girl
Tell her anything she want
And it's not really wrong
When the liquor is involved
Till she like...
And I'm like..

So after that
We just throw the shots
Back to back to back to back we 3-peat
Everything we do can't take back no receipt
Put your number in my phone
And a place to meet me
And you are about to find out
When the jeep go beep beep
She got lost with a sip of Voss
When I lick across
I'm the boss, whatever it costs til
She take it off..take it off.. Take it off

I'm Sippin' I'm still Sippin'
Tryna kick me out the bar
Boy you must be tripping hold up
I'm Sippin' I'm still Sippin'
How the hell I'm supposed to leave
Without all these women hold up
I'm Sippin' I'm still Sippin'
Nah don't be mad
Cuz I'm out here living hold up
I'm Sippin' I'm still Sippin'
Tryna kick me off the bar
But I'm still Sippin'


How is it?
How many just spending
And the lights ain't even came on yet
And you are telling me
I'm at my limit
I don't get it
Look at all these women
How the hell could you player hate
And stand here just grinnin'

She say she got a man
But she likes to creep creep
Shoulda came with a button
Cus this shit is too easy
That puun puun fire
Not enough to keep me
So she better snapchat
And put the night on repeat

Pour up the Jame-o
The party don't stop till I say so
We sip gin by the caseload
Yeah you better get high or lay low

I'm Sippin' I'm still Sippin'
Tryna kick me out the bar
Boy you must be tripping hold up
I'm Sippin' I'm still Sippin'
How the hell I'm supposed to leave
Without all these women hold up
I'm Sippin' I'm still Sippin'
Nah don't be mad
Cuz I'm out here living hold up
I'm Sippin' I'm still Sippin'
Tryna kick me off the bar
But I'm still Sippin'

Pour up the Jame-o
The party don't stop till I say so
We sip gin by the caseload
Yeah you better get high or lay low
Pour up the Jame-o
The party don't stop till I say so
We sip gin by the caseload
Yeah you better get high or lay low

But I'm still Sippin'
Tryna kick me off the bar
But I'm still Sippin'
