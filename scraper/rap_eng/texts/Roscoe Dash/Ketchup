We the only way to what each other
We just want the bread and cheese and extra lettuce
We’ve been far and cause we brought the drugs
They won’t let us they thought
They were leading until a n***a catch up
And this is how we play catch up where we from
And this is how we play catch up where we from
And this is how we play catch up where we from
And this is how we play catch up where we from

I might pass by one more time
But I might pass them blind

Walking bendo
Checking money anywhere I can though
Oh fuck we going to make a movie on Samuel
Staying big by the benz
Bought a benz for my benz
Now I pull up like I’m full of family
Call my exes wonder what it could have been
Now I’m flexing now I know we going to bring your money
For these days these rebels they come and they go
I am coming and you still got to come and come in low
You n****s funny like bubbing your funny bone
I know some n****s playing catchup
Someones got to step up
How these n****s got so
And they always mess up

[Hook]
We the only way to what each other
We just want the bread and cheese and extra lettuce
We’ve been far and cause we brought the drugs
They won’t let us they thought
They were leading until a n***a catch up
And this is how we play catch up where we from
And this is how we play catch up where we from
And this is how we play catch up where we from
And this is how we play catch up where we from
