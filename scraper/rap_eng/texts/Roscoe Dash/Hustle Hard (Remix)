[Intro]
Figured everybody else doing this shit, I might as well do it too.. Know what I mean?

Look..

[Flow]
Okay I hustle hard, Tim Tebow (Tebow!)
Lamborghini, no evo (no!)
Big Catholic casinos (whoa!)
Freeze me like it's TiVo
I got swag baby, they choosin' (choosin')
[? :22] is up and y'all losin' (yeah)
Y'all said we couldn't, we proved it
Now we brick walls, we ain't movin' (no!)
Okay and I'm on ten like eleven, (go!)
Two new hoes, they caressing (whoa!)
We fornicating, record the tape and you watching, viewers discretion
So I understand why y'all hatin', (yeah)
Got so much cheese I can't grate it (no)
Flow is dumb, you can't phase it, they like "look what y'all done created" (damn)
I got stupid hits with no album out, (no)
Stupid shows and I'm cashing' out (here)
Groupie hoes that got so [? :45] they hit the room with no panties now (damn)
Got my old hoes, my hand-me-downs
We work hard while y'all stand around
It's been a long time coming, we ain't going nowhere, so you got some time to plan around
And I'm flawless baby... Excellent
In every subject, and predicate
I'm focused man, I go locust man, on top of that there's too much bread to get
So for y'all the same old shit... Just a different day
Y'all working double time, just for second place

'Cause I hustle, hustle, hustle... Hard
Hustle, hustle, hustle... Hard
Hustle, hustle, hustle... Hard

Closed mouths don't get fed on this boulevard (no!)
