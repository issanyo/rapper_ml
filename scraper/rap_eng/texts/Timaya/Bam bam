If I no get money, tell me wetin I gain? (eh)
Nobody feel to feel the way I feel the pain
Nobody saw the tears, I no get energy they want to drain (eh)

Hustle every night jostle** in the morning
Gat to get my doe, gat to get the money

F*ck it, my nigg*s know me, f*ck it, am not your homie (eh)
Am all about my money, nobody t’o le burn mi (eh)
Came from the bottom to top, and I ain’t never flopping
Ain’t never scared of nobody, and ain’t gon’ stop (eh)
Ah, I no be game, you want dey play with me (eh)
Ah, when I dey grind, you no dey stay with me (eh)
Ah, when I dey fast, you no dey pray with me
Now you cock-blocking all because you see them paying me (eh)

Ah, let’s take it to club and give them sanko (eh)
