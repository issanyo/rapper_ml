[Intro]
To know the truth is to know the self
To know the self is to know the Mecca
Mecca's not a state of mind or a place
Mecca is a way of life
It is the answer to all confusion
The attribute
Adolpho, Abdullah, Mohammed
Makes way for the return of the Mecca
Salaam

[Hook x8]
Return of the Mecca

[Verse 1: C.L. Smooth]
Be sure to explore the hardcore that came before Columbus
Discover no other serve the soul on a dish
Okay means official kid, not decrepit though
The lyrical dynamo set the flow when I do so
Entice the price with the mic device
Hit ya slice so precise that you never hurt twice
Fierce how I pierce when you near the frontier
A world premiere so put the armor on your gear
The overlord aboard with the two-edged sword
Adored and restored, now the young gun toward
Preserve the herb, never kick it to the curb
Vocalize a verb, and the return of the word
Mecca, the reincarnated selector
From the whole agenda, something to remember
A richer voice than Robin Leach
I'll reach with a speech, no bleach so you can't impeach
Monumentally smooth, I'll prove it sincerely
To barely when you're near me clearly never sound weary
Maintain the gravity, assault and battery
So sweet the repeat you're bound to catch a cavity
My ability to wreck a facility
C.L.'s potential, smooth and sequential
Deep in every measure, hit the lotto for the beggar
The midnight wrecker, return of the Mecca

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Pete Rock]
Overstand the Mecca in command
Part of the plan is the man who built the land he began
A scripture ripped out the piece of a scroll
Better the know yes, a foretold, the beautiful and bold
Start em in Harlem with the motto, the Apollo
Boogie to me, I'll swallow hollow when you follow
Stable like a turntable, lyrics I cradle
No fable, label or run my tongue around your navel
You're coming to me so therefore the program's Mecca
The silhouette, a weirder fella, darker than vanilla
Talking about the theoretical, isometrical
Alphabetical rebel, a dissect-the-devil
Unveil a tale in detail, the third rail
Read it in braille, a bigger male leave a trail
Now I sink into the link, that'll make you think
You's too large to shrink, I need a drink
And toast to emperor, Mecca said to invent
To know of a child, worth your while so surrender
And never to be lobotomized, the flexin' of the stanza
But you know the answer when I drop a proper grammar
Tabasco, the Late Show, flow to make a peso
I manage to do damage so honey, get Macco
Risen from the prison, the division, Black and Decker
Strictly for your pleasure, return of the Mecca

[Hook]

[Break]

[Verse 3: C.L. Smooth]
OD off the black Baryshnikov
Taking it up north, back and forth, never been soft
Bound to see me swollen like a Beethoven
Listen wide open, never toking, do or die's my slogan
Save the sarcasm, I'll hit you like a orgasm
Back off of that and maybe later let you pat em
Necessary for any adversary to worry
The legendary, primary, never secondary
Dip in Peru, overdue in Honolulu
Now if you knew the preview, could bubble like shampoo
Outclass the mass so we'll look in the hourglass
No time to waste for those in contrast
Like the New York Philharmonic, sent to blow melodic
With the logic I hear like a narcotic
Put your best to rest, so get your bulletproof vest
I got the wild, wild west to your chest
You know the cause of death, so forget the autopsy
Another got sloppy so I lit it in poppy
Smooth as Peabo, with dough like Lillo
For the grand finale I slip on like a Bally
C.L. and P.R., categorizing we are
The soul brother, Mecca lover, funky by far
The classic fantastic, rip it like elastic
Here to get drastic, return of the Mecca

[Hook]
