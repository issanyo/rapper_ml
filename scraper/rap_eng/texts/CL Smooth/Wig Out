[CL Smooth]
Circulate us in the vein, set to ride the cracks on your brain
Like a novocaine, I train to ease any pain (word?)
Yeah, get your wig loose, I relieve tension
The path to my lesson is the highway to heaven (ahh yeah)
Plus, what a rush, catch another one flushed (uh-huh)
Now you got a crush, makin dames wanna blush (yeah)
I stomp out your campfire; liar, retire (uh)
Cause none of these homefries here is Oreida (yeah)
The Wiggy-Wig get the big bread; known to break em like a twig (whoo!)
Gimme beef cause I don't eat pig (uh)
Who runs the joint with the flavors in the Vernon? (uh-huh)
Got _One Life to Live_, _As the World Keeps Turning_ (yeah)
More, take a draw, then react to contact (uh)
A buzz from my cuz I back as a fact (yeah)
Just like the reverend, I make you wanna jump and shout (say what?)
CL Smooth got the Wig Out..

[Pete Rock]
It's the Wig Out, uhh
It's the Wig..
It's definitely the Wig
Wig Out! C'mon, ahh yeah
Come on.. yeah..

[CL Smooth]
With the pace of a racehorse, I cover like lipgloss
Roll with force to get you wigged of course (uh-huh)
The honey-coated brown eyes wise to the franchise
Notice other guys, never twist his size (uhhh, uhhh)
Bigger than life, I hit the wife undercover
You discover when my dog ate the drawers off the mother (uh-huh)
Called her Greedy Gretchen, my pet came fetchin
And shot Old Yeller with the big Smith and Wessun (whoo!)
CL and double-X-L ring a bell
Supplied by the inside, never been a shell
Rowdy, but thoughts got cloudy, you choked
In a puff of smoke, mics were lit, and then broke (yeah)
Back and forth like a game of Ping-Pong (what?)
I get the cypher going like Cheech and Chong (yeah)
And glide through your system, on a funk rhythm (uh-huh)
Honey don't pout, CL got the Wig Out..

[Pete Rock]
Like I said..
It's the Wig..
To make your head go.. AOOWWWWWW!
Yeah.. it's like that..

[CL Smooth]
CL, the A+, while you wear a F like a freebie
With your nine lives this arrives, here kitty-kitty
No more to savor cause I'm here to kick flavor
The most common denominator, said none graver
Sufferin succotash, a blunt for the cash
Whiplash, FloJo in a forty yard dash (uh)
Solid like a dome, never fall like Rome
A notch for your crotch so honey heat it I'm home (uh)
My baby's a lovechild, say whassup to ya (uh-huh)
Like Dr. Welby, I keep the boy healthy (yeah)
Pete knowledge me, flip it over and it's sweet
Entwined when I mentally design verse three (uh)
Appears so real when the Soul Brother sun (yeah)
If you rate it on a chart, it would be number one (uh-huh)
Spread it like sauerkraut, the main event doubt
You wind up in a rout, CL got the Wig Out..

[Pete Rock]
CL got the Wig.. come on
CL got the Wig Out.. yeah
Shit is funky..
Yeah.. uh-huh..

Wig Out! Uh, the Wig Out!
The Wig Out.. *fades*
