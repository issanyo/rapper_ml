[Verse 1]
It's time to dip dive dip, you might break a hip
To the sound that's legit, I've come to make a hit
I usually bust scratches with my brother, C.L. Smooth
But, I decided to get wreck on this groove
As I provide the slide you're going on a ride
I know the weather's nice, there's no need to play the outside
Guess who's on the flyer, the man of your desire
Pete Rock and C.L. Smooth all the honey-dips admire
Beats are rough and rugged, Pete Rock is the creator
Now I'm busting raps while switching cross-faders
Making sure my sound hits from here to Grenada
Honey gave me skins, man, I told her friends I ate her
But, wait up, I save this subject for later
But, it's time to get wreck with the creator

[Verse 2: Pete Rock]
I'm addicted like a stoag, not into vogue
(Yo, Pete, there's a girl on the phone)
Tell her to hold cause I'm busy kickin' rhymes to the rhythm
Fortified with soul cause that's what I give 'em
Honeys form a line form a line cause I always seem to capure
Beats made of rupture, rhymes made of rapture
Far from illiterate, always seem to get a hit
If you try to step to this, don't even consider it
Skins when I want 'em, but, only when I need 'em
To set the record straight, I'll be damned if eat 'em
Call me Pete Rock, I make the girls flock
And if you want a beat like this, I got them in stock
So, flow with the flow, because you know I'm good to go
As I proceed to get wreck on your stereo
Not an imitator, just a crowd motivator
But, it's time to get wreck with the creator

Now, C.L. Smooth, cut it up like this
(scratching)

[Verse 3]
Now, I'm'a take a try and get a piece of the pie
If they give me one sec to get some wreck
Never filled with anger, a good body banger
If you try to step to this you'll get hung on my hanger
Before I say good-bye suckers gave a good try
But, point blank you just can't see this
My word is beneficial, Pete Rock is the issue
And I know you know my style is official
I might give a scratch (Yes, cousin)
Or I might kick a verse (No question)
Either one, I can't be seen, honeys call me tall and lean
And if you want to stick around, I'll show you what I mean
Not an imitator, just a crowd motivator
But, it's time to get wreck with the creator

It's time to get wreck with the creator
Get wreck with the creator
The creator

C.L. Smooth, get busy
