[Verse 1: CL Smooth]
You're everything that I dream about, talk about
Walk around and brag about, cause I don't give a damn about
What they say, what he say, or she say
I'm addicted like drugs to your loving, but hey
You got me strung like I'm young and it's crazy
You're making me nervous, I don't deserve this, I'm Swayze
I wish I could be but you really got a hold on me
With your sex appeal, I'm telling you how I feel, shit is real
Now I don't really want to play myself so I say to myself:
"Self get a grip and don't slip"
Cause I don't want you to think I'm some clown from out of town
I get down, I've been around, I ain't no hand-me-down
So you gotta show respect for me if you're checking for me
And don't sweat me cause I really don't want no sweat on me
If you got it, good, flaunt it
You know what it takes and you know how I want it

[Hook (2x)]
(I know how you want it) Don't tease me, just please me
(I know how you want it) Now what you gonna do when you get it?

[Verse 2: CL Smooth]
Everybody knows you and they show you mad respect
You give me funny feelings with your million-dollar step
Never quiet is kept, honey always stayed dip
I'm thirsty for your love, sugar can I get a sip?
Well maybe just a taste in the place that make your face bend
And I would never try to kick it to your best friend
So what's the deal, what's the haps, where we at now?
Keeping it strong, moving it along, I'm here to show you how
So all I wanna know is what you really wanna do
I try to flex but sex ain't sex unless I'm sexing you
And I'll be swimming in some trim with a beachfront view
Cause all I wanna do is get next to you
Now leave your crew so we can step into my hideaway
So I can step into it right away
If you got it, good, flaunt it
You know what it takes and you know how I want it

[Hook (2x)]

[Verse 3: CL Smooth]
Before you sit back and think I ain't saying nothing
You need to sit back and think about what I'm saying
Now relaying, my carmel flow
So you can see the arrow fly before it leaves the bow
Slow like Cupid, taken from a mobster
At night I crack her open just like a lobster
(My CL Smooth) It's all good baby
Now you know why I'm stressed when you act shady
Sometimes you chit chat, now and then hide the cat
When all I wanna do is just flip that
But there's a side to me only you can see
Only you can so believe in your man
I want you to love me in a special way
When I come home from making lucci to parlay
If you got it, good, flaunt it
You know what it takes and you know how I want it

[Hook (4x)]
