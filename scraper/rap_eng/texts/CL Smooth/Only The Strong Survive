[Intro]
Yeah, DJ Krush in the house, the Carmel kingpin C.L. Smooth
And only the strong survive

[Verse 1]
Actual facts, the ghetto reacts to warfare
Real bullets miss you by your hair
Survival of the fittest, hell for the three time losers
The prisoners of enemy maneuvers
Hold down the fort, cause life is short enough to get it taken
Forsaken when your mental plane's breakin'
Concealin' a 4 pound with every area we surround
Cause clown, I get down for my crown
Take it to the streets for the honor and respect
Connect the lethal, plus my young guns are unbeatable
Aidin' and abettin' the foul is a violation
That's why my retaliation is premeditation
The invitation is to run with a crew you can't do
And too great to infiltrate from a nickel-plate
I state: This be the illest ever known on a rush
Swervin' with the krush

[Verse 2]
Slip into the world of sheisty individuals
A troubled man stalked by criminals
Creepin' through the city, I step on the block to chat
With thugs from all the drugs for fatcat
Steppin' off the set, now hand on my tool
Thinkin' how bad I wanna flip on that fool
Times are wastin', chasin' these punks for petty loot
When there is a real mission to execute
I put the plan in effect, forget what you heard
When you get the word from 1st and 3rd
For real, I got the fam and all my soldiers to feed
With the yardi gunslingers on stash puffin' weed
Envision the prison that I walk through, leavin' any witness
When I'm about to handle my business
No escape from the duct tape and artillery
Now tell me big man, where's the money? Ain't a damn thing funny

[Verse 3]
Cops play for medals, killers play for corners
And in the middle are your sons and all your daughters
Who gives the orders to chaos and mayhem?
Who has the proper guidance and mind to save them?
From this cold world of heartless ghetto dwellers
Pimps to prostitutes and dope sellers
Fellas, strive to be the lead, not follow
Ladies, you can be the queens of tomorrow
Dig it, I want all that and more for my peeps in the struggle to jilter
Food, clothin' and shelter
Is essential to maintain the hardcore from the soft
That pushed me to the edge but I can't fall off
My battlegrounds keep the sound of babies cryin'
Gunshots and cursin', can you feel my reel?
Here's the deal, by any means necessary, go all out
And keep this alive, cause only the strong survive
