[Intro: CL Smooth]
"So bring it down"
Bust it off
"So bring it down"
Uh lick shot one time for the Mecca don
"So bring it down"
And the Soul Brother #1
"So bring it down"
Job is done with the YG'z Menace II Society
"So bring it down"
Feel the real steel, the hot metal
"So bring it down"
"So bring it down"

[Verse 1: CL Smooth]
It's the kill or be killed, rugged skill, that's often
And land your fucking asses in a coffin, what
You see cold steel, cause niggas wanna mill'
Like Shaquille, O' Neal
Bullets are real, cock it back and then I peel off
Fuck the kamikaze Mecca is on the shotty hottie
The cops are running white chalk around your dead body
Abandon ship, niggas are ready to flip and bag a punk
They can't fight next night, twist a lism by your grave sight

[Verse 2: Tommy Guest]
Over, yes you over, six feet under
You sleep, I'm outta these, you're deceased
A reason for the treason, hunting season
Not for rabbit
I deals for niggas drinking beers lounging off block
Till the early morn', word is bond, another brother gone
Caught up in bullshit, quick talking with nines and banana clips
Vermilion with bloodshed, the color red, two to the fucking head
Man you're dead, Death Becomes You

[Hook][8X]
"So listen" - Slick Rick
"So bring it down"

[Verse 3: CL Smooth]
Infrareds locked on ya heads here come the feds
Freeze now when I squeeze hot metal breeze
Right through your arteries to bring you to your knees
I think he's dying black
I got the track to send you silly ass niggas back
Snatch ya ho stab ya pimp and watch him limp away
I fiend Luchi till I'm fucked up old and gray
Hey dog I send you to the morgue
I'm from the Vernon ville blood spills shells drop
Because I gotta kill

[Verse 4: Kenny Austin]
When ya heard it go pop-pop
My Glock hit a nigga's knot
Cause I'm one of the hard akh's smokin' motherfuckers like crack rocks huh
So back up, be ghost when I keep my toast Murder She Wrote yo
Fully equipped with this death blow, flippin'
Because I'm on the level like the rebel crazy bodies and tombstones
Straight to the devil, nigga lay in ya bedspread
Because ya through from evil that men do
Shifty nigga Death Becomes You

[Hook][8X]
"So listen"
"So bring it down"

"So listen to what we say because this type o' shit it happens everyday"

[Verse 5: Cl Smooth]
No resurrection with protection slay cut up in the blender
Just like Mohammed blowin' up the World Trade Center
The hellraisin' burner blazin' stressin' major caution
See the Mecca Don showing a tongue like Jordan
Anything you cherish I perish, I'm here to roll
And now you punks are pickin' lead out ya asshole
Gun smoke when the hood is broke and need the riches
Cause all this nigga want is more dough and more bitches

[Verse 6: Pete Rock]
Buck-buck-buck-buck rat-tat-tat I'm on a mission nigga
I shoots to kill when I pull the motherfucking trigger
I'm sick in the head I'm crazy I'm fuckin' wild
I swear to God I'm coming straight from the penal
I'm Menace like Dennis so don't try to play me close
I wave my gun in the air yo I don't fuckin' care
It's Pete Rock on the mic check one, two
I got the Glock nigga, Death Becomes You

[Outro]
"So listen"
"So bring it down"
"So listen to what we say because this type o' shit it happens everyday"
"So bring it down" "So listen" etc
