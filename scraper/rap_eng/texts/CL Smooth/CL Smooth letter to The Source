A point of clarification in the Pete Rock & CL Smooth "True to the Game" article [by Louis Romain, August '92]. Referring to the quote "If LL takes his hat off, he's over..." I did not intend to imply that LL Cool J fell off, is wack, etc., but rather to note that he uses a specific gimmick as an artist (case in points: Humpty's nose). I grew up with LL being one of my favorite rappers and he was an inspiration for me to do what I do today
