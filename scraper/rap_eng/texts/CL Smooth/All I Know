[Verse 1: C.L. Smooth]
I make it move like I wanna move with them horns
Let 'em play with them strings
While I spit the life of kings
Put a could in it
Stood with it, we at it
Dudes that was meant to have it
Fans wanna reach out and grab it
I'm just an ordinary man
With an un-ordinary lifestyle
Seen early, I would live as a child
I was conceived a mistake
But through God was really all it take for me to be born
And make the earth shake
This was raised from the bottom
So before them plain cones got 'em
Soak up the four square miles to pop 'em
It's me in the flesh
Here to put the rumours to rest
And let you celebrate hip hop's best
From the womb to the tomb
Hit the game real soon
With a tune that's gonn' take sun
Straight to the moon
Taddau
See it's my turn now
All competitors bow
All you sayin' is "WOW"

[Hook]
All I know
It's the way it gotta go
And everything you take to hold me down
All I see
It's the way it gotta be
If you came to see me hit the town
This is my vibe
The way I survive
And peoples can't play me out of bounds
Here's my point
On the Jazzy Jeff joint
That's why C.L. can wear the crown

[Verse 2: C.L. Smooth]
When you think about the pedigree
I own the whole catalog
All I'm sayin' is
Don't sleep on me dawg
I really waked them streets there
Schooled them young wolves
C.L. will slay anything in his way
Okay it's all about the aura I project
That ultimate connect
And how you see me as a man of respect, right
So it's like a mutual agreement
All your feed is in the seamon
Learn the rules
Let you earn your pay sure
Knows of when you think of what it cost me
And how the world forced me to kill 'em softly baby
How the music sound from the basement
And how the world blessed me
Who let you see the fame don't impress me, dig it
Why it's cut from a different cloth
Blood it, set it off
Keep a real nice piece of the love easy
Anytime you can hold ya head
Then you can hold some bread
And relate to what C.L. said
Yes....

[Hook]

[Verse 3: C.L. Smooth]
It's Jazzy Jeff on the turntables
C.L. on the M-I-C
Philly on up to the N.Y.C
And breakdances, God
Tags in the trainyard
Wild style fat laced
Thugs locked up
From a 1980's case
Goons with them grown kids
Used to them long bids
Meet you on the dance floor
Slash the visit then
A lot from the rep to
And seein' it all makes sense
If I'm the king
Then that should make you the fresh prince
Send for the driver
You lookin' at the real soul survivor
Like my man J. Period
Mix tape
The man on fire
Featuring the guested Jeff host
You marvel at the up close and personal
Meetin' other minds
You should read the signs
This is what reclines
The thoughts in my lazy boy
Fit like a hand and glove
Through the city of brotherly love

[Hook]
