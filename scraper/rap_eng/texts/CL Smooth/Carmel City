[Verse 1: C.L. Smooth]
Let me take you on a journey through Carmel City
Where CL's God, and the ladies gotta hit me off
Ballin on the set now baby what's the matter
When all this is Hot Sex served on a platter
Enter my flow so I can hit this show with somethin rugged
It's mainly how all the honeys dug it
Like every single day and, bounce around the way and
Chicks are never waiting when the bodies start marinating
We expand in player's land to unknowns
To turn my stumbling blocks, into my stepping stones
The pound Donna Karan New York down found
Where there can be no type of slacking in your macking
The whole agenda is for me to decide; the major hustle
Is God, when brothers coincide, with the bonafide
CL Smooth, you know the Mecca Don
Where love is only for me, in Carmel City

[Hook]
C'mon y'all

[Verse 2]
Top notch, butterscotch, lyrics hits the mode
To make the most gorgeous women wanna get nude
Your eyes stay glued, when this is popping word is bond
Wifey's gone, now I'm about to get my swerve on
Lay my clothes across the bed, cause I'm here to make a point
Plenty chips, got me balling in a hot joint
Respect the sextafied aura you could never take light
It's like bringing a knife to a gunfight
My large releases got me mixing with the dimepieces
And down to rival one of Uncle L's little nieces
In my palace of pleasure, everything is done properly
And if you didn't know, you better ask somebody
Right now, the players are the power structure
Check the roly-poly, now it's time you see the brother
CL Smooth, you know the Mecca Don
Where love is only for me, in Carmel City

[Verse 3]
It's freaktacular, wasn't hard to get em out the blouse
If only wifey knew, hubby got a stash house
And what moves your man got with so much emphasis
Maybe one or two many get ridiculous
So scandalous, the honey arrives with her crew
And now they're talking bout coming back without you
Yeah my boys are balling, here's the raw deal:
Come to my house, you gotta get naked for real
Indulging, my peoples said let's have a talk
About the time my lady's plane hit New York
I'm bailing off the set, heading for the crib G
Cause I'm the first thing the woman wanna see
Take a hot shower, slip on some linen
Now it's a new time, a new day, a new beginning
CL Smooth, you know the Mecca Don
Where love is only for me, in Carmel City
