[Verse 1: CL Smooth]
Open Sesame, stepping through the mist, it's the specialist
Coming to box, and flooded with rocks
We'll get down for mine, the kind that makes cement feel us
Standing in the company of killers
Follow my trail as I walk through the valley of death
Left, to fear no evil, cause what I grip is legal
I'm hot like yard, the point guard of this group, on the loop
Never your right, raising all your game type tonight
Entering the level of high gear
You'd think it took a Bob Marley spliff to get here
Front to rear God of the drugs that you're hearing
While my neighbors say we need to be jailed for rackateering
Now appearing, Pete Rock and CL Smooth to the jugular
Now you got Mecca and the Soul Brother
Slightly, you might raise a hair of doubt
But if we don't rock the spot, The Sun Won't Come Out

[Hook: Pete Rock]
Check it out, without Pete Rock and CL Smooth
Without Anger in the Nation
Yo, without Mecca and the Soul Brother
You know The Sun Won't Come Out
Without Pete Rock and CL Smooth
You know we can't Reminisce
If we don't Straighten It Out
You know The Sun Won't Come Out

[Verse 2: CL Smooth]
Un-chained heat, I hustle on the street a beat
To keep you on the edge of your seat, you consumer
A QB-like Boomer, the ultimate team
But if I wake up in another woman's bed, I'mma scream
I'm settin up shop pop to overthrow Castro
Chokin over Noriega's Garcia Vegas
Guess who supplies the pies and dope triples
Now she leaks ass cheeks, pearly whites and titty nipples
Would CL ever trick loot on PC?
Even if I never had sonny boy I disagree
Cut the small talk, I give more marks than a school of sharks
On attack, so keep your ass back
When it's wack you get a thumbs down, another record deal wasted
Listen man, find another occupation man
Here's the persuasion, blazin one amazin route that's all about
The Sun Won't Come Out

[Hook: Pete Rock]
Yo, so check it out, with Pete Rock and CL Smooth
You gotta Act Like You Know
If It Ain't Rough, It Ain't Right kid
You know The Sun Won't Come Out
Without Pete Rock and CL Smooth
You can't Reminisce to T.R.O.Y
If we don't Straighten It Out
You know The Sun Won't Come Out

[Verse 3: CL Smooth]
I woo chicks off acoustics, watchin the Knicks
We up ten, we need to stop shootin bricks
Put the jailhouse funk in under stars
Til the lines on my looseleaf, look like some metal bars
My forecast hits a megablast, and what I invent
A pack of bloodhounds could never get the scent
Payin off the beast now my bills increase
If there's a five dollar rock sold in the park I want a piece
The Sun Won't Come Out, unless the crowd start this
Cause if it was my choice, you all dance in darkness
Cause any verse rips a total eclipse for sun rays
Anyways was the phrase back in my younger days (so check it out)
Now the God displays the attribute, dealin with heat
From the basement, enterin the streets you meet
Pete Rock and CL Smooth and when you see what it's about
You know The Sun Came Out, now pass my shades

[Pete Rock]
Yo, without Pete Rock and CL Smooth
Without Anger in the Nation
Yo, without Mecca and the Soul Brother
You know The Sun Won't Come Out
Without Pete Rock and CL Smooth
You gotta Act Like You Know
If It Ain't Rough It Ain't Right kid
You know The Sun Won't Come Out
Without Pete Rock and CL Smooth
We can't Reminisce
Yo, if we don't Straighten It Out
You know The Sun Won't Come Out
Without Pete Rock and CL Smooth
Without Ghettoes of the Mind
If you know what I'm talking about
You know The Sun Won't Come Out, so check it

[Outro]
One two, Pete Rock and CL Smooth for ninety-four
Breakin you off somethin proper
Check it, peace y'all
