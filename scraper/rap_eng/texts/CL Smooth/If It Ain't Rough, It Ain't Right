[Produced by Pete Rock]

[CL Smooth]
Above the level of a mezzanine, healthy as Ovaltine
The dominant gene clean, I mean go, the light's green
The protege could play like chess to quest the best
Confess, never poor as Bangladesh
I get busy like a boxer, operate like a Doctor
Seal like a locker, pop like Orville Redenbacher
Buy the tape, LP, CD
All me, and Petey, to cater to the needy
Like a Prayer for Madonna but A Different World for Jasmine
CL is well a physical attraction
Let me make myself perfectly clear:
While I'm there, I make a peer a positive pap smear
Really I do, once I light the barbeque
Thread the loose ends, see my friends are the crew
The fright night King of New York like Frank White
If it ain't rough it ain't right man listen..

[CL Smooth]
If it ain't rough enough, to mingle in the stuff
To scar and scuff and make you cuckoo like a cocoa puff;
It ain't right so I smash the satellite
Check the farenheight, before I take flight
Unique as Mozambique, here to freak Sheik
The skills that won't leak, and never antique
Warm like a oven you're lovin the style I'm druggin
Alleyway muggin, heavyweight sluggin
No fibs I kick the ad libs and rock it in the cribs
Break your ribs like a toothpick cause you were never slick
? you lacked back when I first started
CL's the one who got the Red Sea parted
My conversation qualification is a doozy
The rude Rudy wreckin write you off as a floozy
I shoot for the moon, but even if I miss
I'm among the stars, to put a bullethole in Mars..

[CL Smooth]
In my frame of mind I design the best-seller
For rougher cats can Rockafeller you're Penn and Teller
Steady with the convo, rough like Brillo
Let your head hit the bed and knock the feathers out your pillow
The master intelligent, with the black testament
Found it relevant, and mailed it to the President
But overall I get papes for my labor
With the physical manifestation of a saviour
You wanna test this, but I slay anyway
Cause your rhymes are old, with more wrinkles than a shar pei
Mecca Don upon the streets of Babylon
Pass the baton to respond like Farrakhan
Hard like Shaft with the staff for the Backdraft
A blazin aftermath, so hon make a path
If you don't trust him, bust him
But if you don't have a weapon, then kid keep steppin
The main idea in here for the hemisphere
CL's here to get wreck for the year
A large man's appetite, blowin like dynamite
If it ain't rough it ain't right, COME ON!
