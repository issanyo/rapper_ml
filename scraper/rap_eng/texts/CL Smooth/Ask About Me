[Chorus]
Ask about me
When the time is now
Ask about me
When you know my style
Ask about me
Why they stand and bow?
Hold up!
Ask about me
How they pop champagne
Ask about me
How they entertain
Like something for the brain

[Verse 1]
They're like "who that?"
Center stage and relevant
Like the 5 star G is the president
Put it down for hip-hop is the policy
The way I play the rap game, call it prophecy
How I get that hood love is magical
But how I get my respect is international
Heard I chef good food and I blow scum
And walk these streets like a godfather
When I present myself as a gentleman
Show love to me, status is irrelevant
Like a boss move, rolling with force prove
You see when things get wrong, I was so smooth
My balls are lethal, but I am for the people
When you measure catalogs there is no equal
In my world no such thing as pretend
Just a real life artist that set the trend

[Chorus]
Ask about me
When the time is now
Ask about me
When you know my style
Ask about me
Why they stand and bow?
Hold up!
Ask about me
How they pop champagne
Ask about me
How they entertain
Like something for the brain

[Verse 2]
Man, he looks familiar, what his name is?
That old school cat, oh the dude famous?
Still look the same, still a high roller
Get another hit shake and boil the game over
All these swaggerless monkeys, I remain humble
In this position I played, is king of the jungle
Don't mistake the forest from the trees
The rats from the cheese, the lames from the Gs
If you can ride on horses, saddle up
I got your number right now, just dial it up
In the right frame of mind with the ability
I'm into taking all power literally
The higher hierarchy, the ones in position
To eat their food, that is the mission
When it switch, when it change in the transition
How to wire that?
Come here, take a listen

[Chorus]
Ask about me
When the time is now
Ask about me
When you know my style
Ask about me
Why they stand and bow?
Hold up!
Ask about me
How they pop champagne
Ask about me
How they entertain
Like something for the brain

[Verse 3]
You see my model is where the paper leads me
Even though that my reputation precedes me
Put your money on your mind, let it calculate
Feel the safe up nice, and let it marinate
Let the word bubble, can't knock your hustle
But if I gotta break it down, then I charge double
The uncut raw, you're looking at the connoisseur
Minds is on the block 100 percent pure
Nothing stepped on, but my enemies' backs
No lies I'm living
I just state the facts
Same number with the tax, my new creation
But if the price skyrocket, call it inflation
Translation? I'm kicking, naw I mean? (Yao Ming)
Point God but I'm patient, set the screen
Taught the rap game on how to survive
I'm top 50 all time, dead or alive

[Chorus]
Ask about me
When the time is now
Ask about me
When you know my style
Ask about me
Why they stand and bow?
Hold up!
Ask about me
How they pop champagne
Ask about me
How they entertain
Like something for the brain
