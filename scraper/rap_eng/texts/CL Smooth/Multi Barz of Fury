[Verse 1: CL Smooth]
Why is it a perfect fit
With that purple lit
To drop that smooth gangster shit
Classical material
Whats love compared to fearing you
The biggest names in the game hearing you
Spit Multi Barz of Fury
Nothing else can cure me
But a whole 'nother way to hustle surely
Thugs gotta eat it up
DJ's beat it up
The kid put his feet up
And watch it all heating up
The way this stay when it made your wardrobe sprinning
But not in that order
First run my tub water
The Bed, Bath & Beyond to come and relax the don
I breathe hits no matter whose track I'm on
Them old days is gone
I'm here to make new ones
New chemistry, new broads, new guns
Right now son, send them over
Have them all bent over
Follow me, its gonna happen just like I told ya
They hate me, bitching, untrustworthy
Switch from the first pitch, the reason you not rich
And often ripped, wouldn't handle a rubber grip
We got 'em under the arm or right on the hip
Give jake the slip
Improv half the script
Regardless we got steady bank to flip
Aim, squeeze, and dip
And take it down south
But I'm a die-hard New Yorker
We hit him in the mouth
No surprise I'm that real
Its what I'm all about
When the man came to do what the experts doubt
From exile, a high profile
Never liked my style
But let one or two moves stick
Now you on my dick
Separate the real from the counterfeit
Cause I'm the last one who wanna be around that fake shit
This is glory, penned up from the Morey
Damn that money earnin' nigga from Mount Vernon at it again
Here's a two-way send, we set the trend
The drama only brings out the best in them
But do I trust it? No
When it comes to that dough
More than half these meatballs gots to go
And I'm letting it flow, you're not letting it grow
CL can take it where it never been before
So when I step in the door
No more dodging and running
Time to ante up, CL is coming
Now here's the issue
Dude's wanna work for me and make it official
All I really need is my word and that pistol
Knife down or fist you
Never could have dissed you
Beam it won't miss you
Highlights are bloated, every little password is coded
Anything high tech we tote it
Women all spread out
Across the bed, across the hall
And right around the hot tub I lost them all
Lay low, they know all that is gravy
No lacks-a-dazy
Love me then pay me

[Outro: ?]
Gotta go and get the money
Gotta go and get the dough
Gotta go and get the money
Gotta go and get the dough
