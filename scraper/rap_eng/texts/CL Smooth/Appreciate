[Intro: Children singing] (5x)
"Two four six eight, who do you appreciate"

[Verse 1: C.L. Smooth]
First of all, you better count your blessings
Cause when you got C.L. now you got bad boy, your connections
In return, while we live and we learn, then you know what it is
To only build a bigger future for the kids
In peace, in war, lets take it to the floor
Every time we take two steps, the crowd takes four
Lay the heat, how I come to the street, how I cut through the beef
Let me handle that, that's why you make me chief
It's packed, what they want in this here
Can we weather the storm, six minutes, C.L. Smooth you're on
All the anger and the fear, was in the dressing room prayer
That we came out to light it up and put it in the air
That's real, so holler back at ya boy, step aside Leroy
To all my ladies, who want tickets, enjoy, cause
I spit it and you gotta get with it and you'll never forget it
Yes, I want the best out, count 'em all

[Hook]
"Two four six eight, who do you appreciate"
To the fans and to all my people that supported us
"Two four six eight, who do you appreciate"
To the mama and the daddy and everything they taught us
"Two four six eight, who do you appreciate"
Tell them kids they gotta stay in school or ride with us
"Two four six eight, who do you appreciate"
When it all goes down, baby, All We Got Is Us

[Verse 2: C.L. Smooth]
Tell 'em this is history in the making, avoiding disasters
This run is for the green jacket, I fit, the masters
My crew havin' business, save, put it in through my office
The security is tight and the secretary is gorgeous
That's official, me and Pete in the lab, that's what they want
Pushin' that real hip hop, up to the front
The game's been good to me, preserved my youth
Not only did it capture my goals, it told me the truth
Look out my hustle, made a living, paid and driven
See why they tour around the world came to save us from prison
It's great, I'd rather love than hate
You think it fell out the sky, I'm here to tell you, why believe in faith
Hard work, payin' of and them wishes comin' true
Bolt open and you out to lunch, and left us two
Now you know we can't let that pass to get that cash
We in the big numbers, count 'em all

[Hook]

[Verse 3: C.L. Smooth]
Why my Uncle Doc left me everything when he died, and
When pop passed, two weeks later I cried, and
When great grandma left it all went crazy now
All I had left was grandma Pam, that's my baby
Can't talk bad about me, she'd tell 'em, why we need to give her
All her roses while she could smell 'em
I live this moment used to stay how we were
How my mother came to her in a dream and told her
Corey will come out of this deep dark depression, stand by me
Give my insight a resurrection and heal me
And feel me, what you got is to love, got a thing
This little woman who brought back the thug, let's grind
Ghetto's Of The Mind while I'm in my prime
I left, so y'all can catch up, I'm ahead of my time
Your legacy and that lazy boy say it ain't fear
My next generation triple my digits, add 'em up like

[Hook]
