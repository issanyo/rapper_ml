[Verse 1: C.L. Smooth]
Never judge a book by the cover
Discover the soul brother with the Mecca don
Working brunette to blonde
How many Edison con when I respond in full black
With us having the vernon villains back-to-back
Amazing grace when I face the great paper chase
For real it’s long overdue
So I don’t wanna talk to you
I stroke the hell out of mademoiselle who insisted
Every night, she get her back twisted in the unlisted
I’m living through my son so daddy see it this way
I want him in the NFL, his brother in the NBA
No doubt I'm with a piece, down in mecca, all crazy
To the late Eve, none of this is make-believe
I breathe some of the most powerful lyrics of our century
Battle physically, conquer mentally
Essentially, you’re dealing with a Mecca affair
So anywhere you wanna go y’know, I’ll take you there

[Hook]
C.L, whatcha gonna do
You know, you can make me, boo
Over, over again
Come on and take me there

[Verse 2: C.L. Smooth]
Control now so in the future see me calling the shots
From larger plots to cash to mini-bikes and open mics
I’m blowing up spots for knots in the millennium years
And now I drop it on my peers, brings tears and fears
And now the question manifest in my only
My soldiers wear Versace or the army fatigue
That brings a world of intrigue and glamour to my arsenal
Of gods, pimps to players and layers of decepticons
My whole mind-state gravitate to weapon
Making people in the business get a misconception
It ain’t hard to the core, it ain’t sex on the beach
It’s just another plateau the brothers have to reach
Emphatic with non-cypher, then we were broke and misguided
Try to gas me like Hitler once we get divided
No question, you’re dealing with a Mecca affair
So anywhere you wanna go, I’ll take you there

[Hook]

[Verse 3: C.L. Smooth]
Set it so I can make em all respect my fame
When brothers try to count all my chips in the game
Now let me civilize your foolish acts of gunplay
The plan of a stick man, the price in how to get away
Chose for negroes, the most hypnotical flows
On the planet, another East Coast track rose, goddammit
My theme, to mainstream’s the knocker
Only time I get writer's block is when my lucci's on lock
Pretty much I’m coming through in the clutch see
My thought is a bombshell, built to only propel
Or is it just my style of hustle making a mark
To rumble the playgrounds with more danger than Jurassic Park
It was dark, when I brought it to the light, for spite
My staff’s got me taking nothing but champagne baths
Now the aftermath’s dealing with a Mecca affair
So anywhere you wanna go, I’ll take you there

[Hook]
