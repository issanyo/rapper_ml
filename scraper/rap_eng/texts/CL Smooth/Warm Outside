[Intro/Hook]
When it's warm outside (let the top down feel the wind blow)
When it's warm outside (you had all winter just to get dough)
When it's warm outside (take your top off let your skin show)
When it's warm outside (turn Smooth up on your radio)

[CL Smooth]
With a mean summer joint gettin plenty airplay
Mixed in the forecast, sunshine all day
Have it your way, love to see me walk around
But still I don't dress that up, I dress that down
Simple wifebeater, bouncin off the tennis sneaker
CL is that trendsetter, born leader
Hot two-seater, fresh out the barber chair
Blow one with my boy boy, then we there
Eatin, shoppin, into full body massaging
Me and my lady, set to do it up crazy
Over wine and cheese, it's times like these
That make you wanna drop the top and feel the breeze
Back in the hood, doin anything I wanna
From shootin hoops to shootin dice on the corner
No helmet on the dirt bike, {?} over to Tim
Hear the broads say ain't nothin colder than them

[Hook]

[CL Smooth]
To make it like a block party come with t-shirts too
Cases of brew and plates of that barbecue
Slay to Clue can tell you are not bluffin
The time of the year where women hardly wear nothin
System pumpin, late until the night is jumpin
Game is tight, know you bound to lead with somethin
Leanin back, in no shape or form reject me
Warm weather just preserve my grown and sexy
In daylight, up and on our race bike
Cake like, my shorty on the back got it straight right?
The scene is blue skies and tanned skin up on me
My whole mood is tropical, true story
How the man livin you can tell that's connected
When you can walk in any neighborhood and get respected
My bad boys move silent
And get it all wet like they opened up the fire hydrant

[Hook]

[CL Smooth]
See me chicks go bananas; I make niggas think twice
About comin through and squeezin them hammers
And ain't it a pity~? With all this +Sex in the City+
It's why them little pea-brains really don't feel me
Heat cause tension, every summer fill morgues
I'm enjoyin the day outside walkin my dogs
Mommas strollin they kids and old people feedin the birds
You see them d-techs pull up on them curbs
I'm out here 'til I got no work left
Deep in the street, it's why them wolves love me to death
As big as my heart is, you look at my team
Got every kid on the block eatin some ice cream
Don't mention it, cause see when money ain't no thing
A dude like me got no problem spendin it
End of the day, wax down my new ride
Just sippin pina coladas, relaxin by the poolside
