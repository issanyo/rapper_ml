[Produced by Pete Rock]

[Verse 1: CL Smooth]
Introducing C.L. then face the feats
Then I remind you of third street when it was sweet
See this, move on and grow to another plateau
With me and... havin that dough
In the last days when critical times, Ileft
To deal with my grand daddy's endeavors
When correcting my errors the first shot came in 91
E.P. done my struggle
To label this untouchable foundation due in 92, top ten review
Respect new when that flew, They Reminisce Over You
Skirt chasin what they rate me in this whole rap affair
But when it really comes down to it who cares
Like the tortoise and the hare ya know the race I run
But ya losin all the nights, ya let the rabbit get the gun
Number one wit a bullet and my pit name, black
It's the best who ever did it on a Pete Rock track

[Hook x2: Pete Rock]
Ayo two cool cats who reclaim the name
Pete Rock and C.L. Smooth in this here rap game
But the good news is that there is a crew
Not 5 not 4 not 3 (Just two!)

[Verse 2: Pete Rock]
In the beginning, let it be like the record spinning
As a child I stack 45's in a pile blow the dust off
Put it on before I can walk
Play static on my pop dukes automatic
I knew I wasn't average music in my bloodstream
My pops watch his son live his dream
Now as time flew, the original classy rock crew
Shine through on streets and avenues
The next chapter you read it MC Shan said it
Gotta give the man behind wheels credit
Yes yes y'all, BLS and Marley Marl
The Rap Attack put my talents on the map
Now it's Pete Rock for days in Tha Basement
As I amaze watch me blow in 98 ways
I specialize in rap, DJ and produce
With more hot tracks then Carlos DeJesus

[Verse 3: CL Smooth]
What it look like, ain't nothin changed but the weather
Still riding with C.D.'s and leather, roll fives and better
For all that's folded in ya pocket, how long it take
To re-up and clock it, drop and make a profit
And lay my position with you that we know what to do
And not to do, stop this fighting each other
God knowledge ya wiz, that you know who the enemy is, furthermore
Don't hide it divide it then X ya squares
To keep them other cats folded like beach chairs
Got an eye on that street aristocrat
Let C.L. show ya where the strengths at
Turn it up right here or just call the cop
Cuz we on it like this to the last stop
The next Humphrey Bogart, mastering art
Like a jeweler wit a diamond cutter, taking em apart
Don't start what ya can't finish
When ya bubble wit skills that never diminish
Ya best team against mine is a light scrimmage
So play like Popeye and eat spinach

Hook x2
