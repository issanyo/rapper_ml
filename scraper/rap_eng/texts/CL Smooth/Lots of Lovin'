Lots of lovin, lots of lovin...

[Verse 1: C.L. Smooth]
A sweet serenade, sip lemonade
As we laid inside the shade
My heart was captured when you possessed it
Carressed and blessed it, even suggested
You love me and I love you
And together, it would just be us two
I would protect ya, in your moment of fear
Relax, lover come here
And let's create this heavenly fantasy
When you lay next to me
I need you, and only you, to give me more
Tender love right down to the core
If you could read what's on my mind
You will find my feelings are genuine
Day after day, you're the one I'm thinking of
With lots of love

Lots of lovin, lots of lovin...the heat

[Verse 2: C.L. Smooth]
Some say the blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice
Make love everyday, okay, produce
I ride through the tunnel of love, share a milkshake
Carve our name in a tree by the lake
Look in your eyes cause I miss you much
The way you say, "I love you, C.L." and your gentle touch
We reminisce with a french kiss
And out of all the girls, you're the first on my list
The only one now, and truly for life
My fianc√©e and future wife
Now you realize, you're the one I'm thinking of
With lots of love

Lots of lovin, lots of lovin...the heat

[Verse 3: C.L. Smooth]
You want to be treated like a queen, stroked like a kitten
Every night you're the mitten I'm fittin'
Tease your lips with the tip of my tongue
And there's no doubt about it, lady, I'm strung
On your love, looks, and affection
You qualify, top choice selection
Woman of a darker breed
Mmm, cutie, you got what I need
Pour the champagne and toast the glass
Taste, but don't drink too fast
Cause we got many nights to cuddle by the fireplace
You blush when I touch your face
Now you realize you're the one I'm thinking of
With lots of love

Lots of lovin, lots of lovin...the heat

[Verse 4: C.L. Smooth]
Allah made you beautiful and youthful
So I feel giving you love is suitable
A walk by the beach, watch the sunset
Love is strong, like when we first met
Wake up in the morning, see your face
And I feel no one can take your place
Ever, so don't even think about it
I need your love and I can't live without it
Baby, you're the one I'm thinking of
From C.L. Smooth, with lots of love

Lots of lovin, lots of lovin...the heat
