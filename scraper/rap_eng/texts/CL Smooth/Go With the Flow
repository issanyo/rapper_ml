(Get on up)

[Verse 1: C.L. Smooth]
Yo', from the intro, I flow
Three in a row, buildin' like a Lego
Stacks upon stacks it attacks the wax
Scrub it like Ajax, relievin as a X-Lax
The night cap of rap here to make another hit
To undercover, smother, word to mother
Pump it for the playground, world renowned
Pete Rock & C.L. Smooth is in town
I design a logical line a mastermind
So recline and listen to what's mine
I'm untouchable, lovable
Some try to imitate, but you can't make a double of
Me, the capital C, capital L, capital S
M-double o-t-h, yes
A pro, so you know
You gotta go with the flow

[Verse 2: C.L. Smooth]
Smooth as ya ever gonna get to hear
Crisp and clear, so step to the rear
And make room for daddy, bigger than a Caddy
To move a crowd? Hm, gladly
It's all done with ease, past MC's
And all they feel is a breeze
The technician with the first division
Like a surgical incision, deeper envision
My flow the naked eye can't stare
But only hear another poet like Shakespeare
C.L. the swinger, ringer, clinger
And oh yes, you know, another hum dinger
Wreckin any studio, love to make cash
So kick it like judo, big like a sumo
Rhymes like a pro, so you know
Like a flute I blow, and go with the flow

[Verse 3: C.L. Smooth]
I rock the microphone but you probably know
To hype the show I gotta go with the flow
And take it to another degree that many people wanna see
But above elementary
I made lyrical, any kind of material
More than minimal, for any individual
That I send, to reach the end
And just like Clark Gable, it's 'gone with the wind'
And take flight, through the night
Like a meteor, right insight to shine like a bright light
You gotta tip-toe from the get-go
Live in stereo, rhymes gotta flip, so
Pete Rock can move your butt and cut the strut
( *scratching* ) Yeah what?
Just like a pro, so you know
I'm ready and set to go with the flow
