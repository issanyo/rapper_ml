I reminisce, I reminisce

I reminisce for a spell, or shall I say think back
Hella great things that tell the way we act
Born on the 12th of October
Never smoked, never drank, life-long sober
Over-stated as underrated since the beginning
When in second grade it was stated that I was a musician
From piano to the sax and other woodwinds
Lessons with jazz legends where Inglewood ends
From the vinyl to the tracks and bumpin' good blends
Breaking and tagging and banging with my 'hood friends
I was about that life for more than a minute
Even though my parents raised me different, I was in it
Irresponsible, plain not thinking
Peers and constables, years of obstacles
Finally hurdled and liquidated like Squirtle
When I verbally murdered derkles, underground never commercial
I make music because music made me
It seems you all forgot the value of it lately
Appreciation is missing, so I'm on a mission
To help you see it glisten when you close your eyes and listen
Positive over negative, gotta let it live
Before it dies - that's a lesson in rhetoric
De ja vu, still the crew gets hella blue
When they reminisce over Drew
Good lord

I reminisce, I reminisce
Reminisce
