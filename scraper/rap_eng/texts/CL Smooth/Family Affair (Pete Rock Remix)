[Intro: Pete Rock]
Mary J, Mary J, remix, remix
C.L., C.L., Pete Rock, Pete Rock
Mary J, Pete Rock, C.L

[Verse 1: C.L. Smooth]
The way I let it
Loose, for real, could only boost, the deal
The bigger the flip, the better it feel
Ladies up shakin', doin' they dance, hands in the air
When Mary drop, it's nothin' but a family affair
Now once you got C.L. poppin', baby, ain't no stoppin'
It's all gravy, once you got the whole hood coppin'
With the queen on my lap with some new paper
Daddy, it's a rap

[Verse 2: Mary J. Blige]
Come on, everybody, get on up
Cause you know we gots to get it crunk
Mary J is in the spot tonight
And I'm a make you feel alright
Come on, baby, just party with me
Let loose and set your body free
Leave your situations at the door
So when you step inside, jump on the floor

[Chorus: Mary J. Blige]
Let's get it crunk up on
Have fun up on up in this dancery
We got ya open, now ya floatin'
So you gots to dance for me
Don't need no hateration
Holleration in this dancery
Let's get it percolatin', while you're waiting
So just dance for me

[Verse 3: Mary J. Blige & Pete Rock]
It's only gonna be about a matter of time
Before you get loose and start to lose your mind
Cop you a drink, go ahead and rock your ice
Cause were celebratin', no more drama in our life
Get the… remix… pumpin', everybody's jumpin'
Go ahead and twist your back, and get your body bumpin'
I told you, leave your situations at the door
So grab somebody, and get your ass on the dance floor

[Chorus: Mary J. Blige]
Let's get it crunk up on
Have fun up on up in this dancery
We got ya open, now ya floatin'
So you gots to dance for me
Don't need no hateration
Holleration in this dancery
Let's get it percolatin', while you're waiting
So just dance for me

[Bridge: Mary J. Blige & Pete Rock]
We, don't need, no haters
We just tryin' to love, one another
We just want y'all to have a good time
No more drama in your life
Work real hard to make a dime
If you got beef, your problem, not mine
Leave all that BS outside
Then we gonna celebrate all night
Let's have fun tonight, no fights
Turn that… remix… way up high
Making you dance all night and I
Got some real heat for ya this time
Doesn't matter if you white or black
Let's get crunk cause Mary back

[Verse 4: C.L. Smooth]
I'd probably boot these thoroughbreds and bully the draw
Step up in the club, and all they wanna start is the biddin' wars
Compared to the young C.L. A much more ruthless
Muck more richer, but it's a family affair
Then I guess I'm just that much more sicker
Cigar blowin', champagne flowin', be easy
Like movin' units is nothin' further that could please me
But how ya marinate my check late with M.J.B

[Chorus: Mary J. Blige]
Let's get it crunk up on
Have fun up on up in this dancery
We got ya open, now ya floatin'
So you gots to dance for me
Don't need no hateration
Holleration in this dancery
Let's get it percolatin', while you're waiting
So just dance for me
Let's get it crunk up on
Have fun up on up in this dancery
We got ya open, now ya floatin'
So you gots to dance for me
Don't need no hateration
Holleration in this dancery
Let's get it percolatin', while you're waiting
So just dance for me

[Outro: Pete Rock]
