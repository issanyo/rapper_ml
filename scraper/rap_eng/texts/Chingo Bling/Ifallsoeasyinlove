[Intro]
I hate that i fall so easy in love (Yeah)

{Bridge 1]

I just want what's mine
You just want what's yours
Won't hold back my life
I've been hurt before
Dance into the night
'till the sun arise
Dance into the night
Taking back my life!

[Verse 1]

Had you in my eyes
Since the moment I arrived
Everything stops
When you walk by
Click the remote
Pause and rewind
Come on baby don't be shy
Let's talk 'bout
You and I
And how the hell you be this fine
Tell me why you should be mine

[Hook]
So fine
God damn hoe
So fine
God damn yo
So fine
God damn hoe
So fine
God damn yo

[Verse]
Got a body I can work with
Got all these women feeling hopeless
They can't talk to you they nervous
Oh that's your man? he bogus!
You should leave with me
Lets walk by so he can see us leave
Or sneak out the back
Keep it between you and me
Baby you're so beautiful
No way that I'm losing you
Close my eyes
Still stuck inside of my cuticles
I love it when you scream my name
We should make a musical
(a musical) This is how it goes

[Outro]
I hate that i fall so easy in love (Yeah)
X3

Love me like you used to
Kiss me like you used to
Hug me like you used to
Love me like you used to
Love me like you used to
Love me like you used to
