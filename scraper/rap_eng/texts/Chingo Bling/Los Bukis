[Chorus: Marco Antonio Solís]
Te quiero
Te quiero
Se olle en mi pecho
Es el grande amor que me has hecho
Latido a latido
Te siento conmigo
Yo quiero ser mas que tu amigo

[Verse 1: Chingo Bling]
Top top top top down got them hoes looking
Heisenberg in the lab back to cooking
Headed out west to expand the business
Now its palm trees Los Angeles
The only fucking Mexican in illuminati
Fuck that newest member of chinga tu madre
I heard your tape and that shit was basura
Switching lanes on that ass screaming la tuya!
I know how it feels to catch 100 bands
I know how it feels to lose 100 bands
Never made a million but I came close
Fame and the power made a player overdose
Yo baby momma said I got the best D
When your girlfriend with me I be stress free
Jesus piece Marco Antonio Solís
Feeling like Los Bukis

[Chorus: Marco Antonio Solís]
Te quiero
Te quiero
Se olle en mi pecho
Es el grande amor que me has hecho
Latido a latido
Te siento conmigo
Yo quiero ser mas que tu amigo


[Verse 2: Chingo Bling]
The blunt plus [?] equal teamwork
You gotta be patient let the dream work
Cause back in the day buying bread with pennies
With the same old jeans same old tennis
Now the only fucking Mexican up in first class
But one day nothing but Mexicans up in first class
I can't fuck with a bitch if she bipolar
Lifes a bitch if she bipolar
Love in the streets that's the hood grammy
It ain't gotta be said it's understood family
I never hit the pen never came close
Got some good as lawyers case closed
Getting head in the whip in your girl car
Arm out the window yelling out worldstar
Jesus piece Marco Antonio Solís
Feeling like Los Bukis

[Chorus: Marco Antonio Solís]
Te quiero
Te quiero
Se olle en mi pecho
Es el grande amor que me has hecho
Latido a latido
Te siento conmigo
Yo quiero ser mas que tu amigo
