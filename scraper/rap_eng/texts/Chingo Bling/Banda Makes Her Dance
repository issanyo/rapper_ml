All these chicks popping pussy

Bands a make her dance
Bands a make her dance
These chicks clappin'
And they ain't using hands

Short hair like Nia Long
Loose one she don't need a loan
She start twerking when she hear a song
The stripper pole her income
We get trippy and then some
So nasty when she rolling
She put that ass off in my hands
I remote control it
She give me dome when the roof gone
At the K.O.D. she leave with me
She got friends bring three
I got drugs I got drinks
Bend it over, Juicy J gone poke it like wet paint
You say no to ratchet pussy Juicy J can't
Racks everywhere, they're showing racks I'm throwing racks
In the VIP rubber on I'm stretching that
Rich niggas tipping
Broke niggas looking
And it ain't a strip club if they ain't showing pussy

Uh, pop that pussy for a real nigga
Pull out my black card, that's my lil' nigga
Make a movie with your bitch, Steven Spiel-nigga
Smokin' on Keysha, Cole give me chills nigga
What's your real name, and not your stripper name
I make it rain on ya, like a windowpane
Bands a make her dance, Tunechi make her cum
Hit it from the side like a motherfuckin' bass drum
Two hoes on one fuckin' pole
Two hoes on my fuckin' pole
I don't tip, I pay bills
Bitches call me Buffalo
Her stomach in, her ass out
I'm flyer than the ones they pass out
If money grow on trees, I branched out
I'm just waitin' for my bitch to cash out!

2 Chainz, four bracelets
Let me see that ass clap, standing ovation
If yo girl don't swallow kids, man that hoe basic
Got two bitches with me, take a shot of one hoe
Using her friend for a chaser
Bands a make her buss it, buss it
Let me see you touch it, touch it
Money talk you ain't got none, end of discussion
Bands a make her do it, do it
Pocket full of money, money
Young nigga getting head while the engine's runnin'
Err! Let me see you wiggle do it for a real nigga
I be laughing to the bank, all you do is kiggle
Balling in my coupe, call it sports car
Drop the top and freak the chick
That bitch just like a porn star
