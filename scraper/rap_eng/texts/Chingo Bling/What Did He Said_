He primo wachala con mi disco is gonna com out real soon
Its called Chingo Bling, the name of the CD is "what did he said" ,because
A lot of people they like to say "what did he said" alright, i dont know whys

Yall some little putitos some little jotitos
Got more wood in my wrinkle
Than them boys in home depot
Chingo Bling culero the number one freestylera
You might know me from el grupo "Los Traileros"
Hog the lane swang and bang Chingo Bling piece n chain
Got a rooster on my back and under that it says my name
Little diamonds on my chain
Big diamonds on my ring
Other one is on my pinky crawlin on some twinky inky
Chingo Bling i'm on fire
You can't stop me, you dont know
I just bearly met your hoe, took her back to MÃ¨xico(wachala)
Diamonds platinum how i chine
You dont wanna see me pull out my 9
Diamonds on my wrist that'll make you go blind
Cover your eyes if you dont wanna go blind
-Hey louisa why you left me for Chingo-
-Cause you dont got no diamonds stupiiiiid-
You see me at the pulga you dont see me at the mall
I started to run fast, but the migra made me fall
Sopita de rice, sopita de pollo
Tengo dientes de ice you got dientes de foil

Aqui mero culeros por Los Stone City Records
Mirame girl mira mira
Platinum and diamonds stupid no chingaderas
You know what you wanna see me with big tiggers en el basement
Or you might see me with Johnny Canales
