(feat. Mike Jones & Paul Wall)

[Chingo Bling:]
Aqui mero culeros
It's the ghetto vaquero
El compadre Chingo Bling, Mike Jones, y Paul Guero
We like bad hoes
We ride 24's
The kind that don't stop jes sir we ride those
(Bloop Bloop)
Drip drop, candy paint and flip flop
Alligator trench coat, with ostrich gym socks
Mi disco Tamale King Pin is in sto's
Ain't no bootlegger gon' get my dough
North side of H-Town, North side Tamaulipas
Some call it chitlins, but we call it tripas
Got beef by the pound, chicken by the ounce
We headed to Fiesta in the Regal top down
Got a tortilla with a lobster tail hangin' out
That's how we do it down south, no tiggity top now
When we do our tour, we gon' need bigger venues
I bet McDonald's put tamales on the menu, putos

[Mike Jones:]
Mike Jones, (Who?!) Mike Jones, Jones, Jones

I'm on the grind that's why I shine
I lay the rules down all the time
I hit the club spend like a pound
Hop in the drop and let my top down
Piece and chain, watch it blang
Open mouth, watch it shine
M.O.B. 'till I resign
'Cuz Mike Jones stay on the grind
2813308004 hit a nigga' up on the low
'Cuz Mike Jones about to blow

Gimm'e 2 more years and my website'll be number 1
Mike Jones, Chingo Bling, we the coldest in the ring
If we come up with a tour now, we'll kill everything (X2)
My album, Who Is Mike Jones? comin' soon (X2)

[Paul Wall:]
Chingo Bling, Mike Jones, and Paul Wall

What it do it's Paul Wall in the mix
I'm with my patna' Chingo Bling out here hittin' them licks
That boy servin' up tamales
Movin' weight like dolley's
Duckin' them federales
Ridin' on chrome polish
I'm candy paint, swanga's is red so I'm hurtin' these boys
I'm 7 30 NexTel so I'm terpin' these boys
I'm playin' with toys
I knocked off, for SS Impala
Bought all my cars cash, tell me who's the real balla
It's Paul Wall, call me the iced out gringo
Wit' Mike Jones and Chingo
Wit hoes I mingle
My trunk pop like Pringles, and wave goodbye
24 Inch chrome why I sit so high?
Baby Bash in the deck How It Get So Fly
I'm sippin' all so you know that my throat ain't dry
I can't lie I'm on the grind 'till the day that I die
I'm tryna get myself a piece of that American Pie, baby
