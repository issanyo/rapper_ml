[Chingo Bling]
What It Do Culeros?
Texas & Cali
On The Same Track
We Out Here In L.A. Baby
Chino Grande Set It Off

[Verse 1]
Mo Money By The Stacks
Paper Route Lookin' Heavy
Bou-Bouncin' In That Bitch
Like A Six-Four Chevy
C-G On The Block
Tugging Twins Ain't Ready
In The Club Make It Rain
Dolla Bills To Confetti

Got The Line Round The Club
Poppin Bottles Like Ooh

We Gon' Be What?
Everybody Gettin Tipsy

Middle Fingers With A Twist
She Gon' Love The Way I Pimp Right
Huh? Yeah

Turn It Up- Up

[Chorus]
This Is What It Is
Shorty Holla What It Do
Throw My Fingers To The Sky
Just Me & My Crew

I Could Tell The Way She Move
Dia-Diamonds On Her Neck
Tenderonies Like Who?
Uh Shorty What?
Turn It Up Like What?
In The Club Like Huh?
Turn It Up Like What?

[Verse 2: Chingo Bling]
Fresh Off The Curb

Hoes Walkin' Round This Bitch
With They Nose Froze
They Use To Pop Mollys
Now They Snort Those Bitch
Its The Future Of Chicano rap
Sent Your Girl A DM
She Swallow For A Follow Back
Who The Ese Rappin' Bout The Border?
Get On The Mic & Talk Shit
The Boy Flow Like Water
Ugh Walk Up In The Fiesta
Lightin' Up The Yesca
Tu Vieja Me La Presta
Por Favor Presenta
I Bust A Couple Nuts
And Then I Take A Siesta
Playa If I Was You
I Wouldn't Even Kiss Em
H-Town South Fe Leoh
In The Streets
My Name Burnin' Em
Hotter Than Gonorrhea
Yeah, I'm New Out Here
I Need A Plug On It
Got 99 Problems
But Respect Ain't One Homie

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Bouncin In The Club
Bou-Bouncin In The Club

She Could Bounce It In The Club
Bou-Bounce It In The Club
She Could Bounce It In The Club
Just To Handle What It Does
