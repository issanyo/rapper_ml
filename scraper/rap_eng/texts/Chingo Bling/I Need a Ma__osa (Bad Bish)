Mañosa, I need a Mañosa (Pasadena gots a Mañosas)
I need a Mañosa, I want a Mañosa (Deer Park gots a Mañosas)
We need some Mañosa, we like the Mañosa (Spring Branch gots a Mañosas)
I want a Mañosa (Clear Lake gots a Mañosas)

(verse 1)
See want a MWA - A Mexican With Attitude
In this little club, ain't no bitchin' here as bad as you
Thousand dollar booty contest, she done won that
Wope 'em out, shake 'em good, chico were the funs at?
Big, fine, keepa gutta
Fat ass baby mother
Super sex a salad strugga
Keep a stash up in the trucka
Always dodging undercova, bust a thong? She buy another
Ain't no puta try tut, bust them with the nunchuckas

She walk like a Mañosa, talk like a Mañosa
She don't need your chit, she got her own, she a Mañosa
Bad bish with good cat (meow), know what she good at
Sophisticated hood rat, asking where that good at
South east and Brenam Park
North west Gulfbank
Bad bish with good date, and her kitty don't stank (meow)
East side Jacinto city, south west with big tittes
H-town be her city, and she looking so pretty

Now thats a Mañosa, now thats a Mañosa
Now thats a Mañosa, now thats a Mañosa
Girl, you a Mañosa, girl, you a Mañosa
Girl, you a Mañosa, girl, you a Mañosa
Huh? you need that syrup? she got it in her purse
Thats the type of bish i be rapping 'bout in that verse
Yeah, you need that weed? she got it in her purse
Thats the type of bish i be rapping 'bout in that verse
