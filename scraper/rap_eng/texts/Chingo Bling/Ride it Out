You play that song so we could keep it crunk 'til the early mornin'. We say eeooh [2x] ride it out
Baby, ride out. Eeooh [2x] ride it out baby ride out. (C'mon)

[Verse 1:]
Abre las puertas muy abiertas let the southwest shine. Hungry like I'm homeless and I can't stop
My grind. I tell you'll struggle but '06 is mine. Magic City's like kronick, see my blood shine
Eyes. I couldn't stop this even if I tried when I'm at the car show I got them sayin' brown pride
Like Roger Troutman, talkbox, so fly dropped the slow jams to make the young girls cry. Not just
The verse, homie this is my life ever since my first solo back in '95. My home studio brought hits
Everytime that's why I gotta claim NB Ridaz 'til I die

All my playaz, thugs, and my ballaz. All my peeps in the clubs spendidng dollas. Hey Mr. DJ won't
You play that song so we could keep it crunk 'til the early mornin'. We say eeooh [2x] ride it out
Baby, ride out. Eeooh [2x] ride it out baby ride out. (C'mon)
