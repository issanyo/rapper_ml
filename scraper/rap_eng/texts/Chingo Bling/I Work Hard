(The Moon Guys)

[Chorus: Chingo Bling]
(I work hard)
I've been working hard x2
(I work hard)
I've been working hard x2
(I work hard)
I just want it all x2
(I work hard)
I just want it all x2
(Dirt Rich in this mother fucker, Chingo Bling in it)

[Verse 1: Chingo Bling]
Staying on the grind like it's clockwork
Some partners slang hard and it's soft work
A star in these streets like my converse
When you see me shining, player, that's just hard work
PTSD like I'm shell shocked
Hustle hustle hard 'till I sell out
Put some money in my mama's mailbox
It feels good to see her shining at the nail shop
Living to the fullest don't know what to tell you
Cousin lost his life due to kidney failure
Inhale life don't let it inhale you
My boy Dirt Rich always got the paraphernalia
Leaning to the side like an old person
Now I'm getting paid ain't no more hurting
Take a long drive do some soul searching
Live life to the fullest 'till they close curtains

[Chorus: Chingo Bling]
(I work hard)
I've been working hard x2
(I work hard)
I've been working hard x2
(I work hard)
I just want it all x2
(I work hard)
I just want it all x2
[Dirt Rich] (Yeah, Dirt Rich mother fucker)

[Verse 2: Dirt Rich]
What you know about hard work?
Money on my mind but I gotta put God first
It could be a lot worse
And fuck rap this is more than just a hot verse
I was dreaming about this when I was sixteen
Now I've got my name written on the big screen
Big dick probably somewhere in your chick's spleen
Nah they ain't 20's but I swear I keep the shits clean
No Ice Cube, no Day-Day
Broke right now but next Friday is payday
Straight to the bank
Smell like dank
Bob Ross flow I go hard in the paint
Had a quarter tank
Now I'm on E
But I'm right where I wanna be
I chase dreams when I can't sleep
Let me tell you one thing about me

[Chorus: Chingo Bling]
(I work hard)
I've been working hard x2
(I work hard)
I've been working hard x2
(I work hard)
I just want it all x2
(I work hard)
I just want it all x2
