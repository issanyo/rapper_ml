[Hook: Kap G]
Okay I'm working like a Mexican
Posted with them immigrants (Home Depot)
He needs his papers from the government
'Bout 50 men and just one caravan
Okay I'm working like a Mexican?
Posted with them immigrants? (Home Depot)
He needs his papers from the government?
'Bout 50 men and just one caravan

[Verse 1: Kap G]
She think I'm hansome, mucho gracias
I just beat it like maracas
Mucho gracias, I'm with muchachas
I got my new cabra boots from Footlocker (snake)
I talk that real spit, like saliva
I know some shooters 'bout them Andre Iguodalas
And they be farmin', Julio César Chávez
I'm in that Honda 88, Tony Gonzalez
You smokin' me homes? Ay no mames
Hey, RIP to Ritchie Valens, la bamba
And if they don't let us sing, then we gon' conquer
And young migo kickin' shit, Jorge Campos

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Chingo Bling]
Fire like habanero
Panamere with Halle Berry
Swapped her out, feed-a-gary
Gettin' money, two faries
Who trillaz, Playboy
Go 'head and pass the mary
Had to get that fur, cause my jury just like "burr"
It's young rich migo gettin' money like I'm Heisenberg
Working like I'm Heisenberg
Say you called the plug, but boy you know you lyin'
Everybody know the plug ain't got no telephone line
Started from the border, from the bottom
My daddy crossed the border so my family won the lotto
My homie I said eat from corporate, Crispy got the deported
So we sendin' money to coyotes, boy you know it

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Kap G]
You keep on talkin', 'bout havin' commas
Aye boy you lyin', like Mufasa
A lot of vatos working in gardens
Them migos keep they Houston Rockets, James Harden
You still buy fake J's from Muhammad
Sellin' tacos en la cancha
My OG though dancing Bachata
The tour is BIG, call me big papa
I keep a small circle, like a cypher
My brother inked up, type rida
Aye young Picasso, eatin' picadas
Got your bitch tip-toein' on my carpet
