(Let the bodies hit the floor)

[Xavier Wulf]

Now let me tell you how I know that I ain‘t who to test
I‘ll cut your ass up and leave you out with the dead
I‘m the AlphaK9, I‘m trying to see some red
You trying to plot on me, bitch you stupid in the head
And nigga yeah, nigga yeah, nigga he ran on me
And I was just chillin‘ but I killed him in the streets
My right hand Kenpachi, he will cut a nigga deep
If any fool make me mad I'll turn into a creep
I‘m lifted off some drugs, and I‘m violent as can be
I‘m the 14th squad captain, wulf the killer freak
I‘m out here every day, trying to hustle just for me
I don‘t give a fuck who I kill as long as I can eat, Bitch!

(Waaaaaan)
