[Chorus 2x: Crunchy Blac]
Love to get high mane
Roll to get high mane
Love to get high mane
Roll to get high mane
Oh please oh please oh please
Just give me just one more hiznit
This hydro weed I got some
I might blow you a shotgun

[Verse 1]
I cheif-ah a swish-ah
My lungs is full of buddah
I choke up the dope up
And then I pass it to ya
I'm high-yah can't lie yall
Man this shits some fire
Covasier,that good hay
And weed bong,got damn yall
I lit it lit it lit it
And then I hit it hit it
I'm smokin like a dope fiend
I need to quit it quit it quit it
Take a pull inhale
Still waitin to exhale
Eyes got bloody red cells
And I'm sippin on some Martel
Its a party goin on inside my fuckin in my fuckin body
And its too wild I can't hang and can't nobody stop it
I smoke that green dope
That high I'm on cloud 9 dro yah
I don't fuck with seeds
You keep your weed I got my own hoe
Shit, you wonder why La Chat don't speak when bitches pass me by
9 times outta 10 when I'm in the wind I'm either drunk or high
And to you smokers holla at me I'm gone smoke some witcha
But if you don't smoke wit me we can smoke
Take a pull for me my nigga

[Repeat Chorus 2x]

[Verse 2]
I keep that chronic in mind
I try my best to stay high
I smoke an ounce of that pure
Man fuck some nickels and dimes
I get to thinkin bout shit
My nigga fuckin this bitch
My thoughts get outta control
I'm finna cut off his dick
Blow me a gun to my nose
My throat is hung up wit smoke
I don't fuck wit you on that dope
If its not makin me choke
I roll up in them sweets
Who got that shit in the streets
I smoke until I'm asleep
Its just the thuggin in me
I hope you already know
You gotta give me some dro
The way you smoke wit yo niggas
Thats how we smokin lil bro
My nig will get a hoe high
But he won't get high wit me
But I ain't fucked up bout that
Its niggas givin me weed
Id go to all neighborhoods
And smoke you out if I could
A smokin session on me
Id charge it all to the good
Mane I'm gone ride and get high
Until the day that I die
I know my lungs ain't bout shit
Cuz dog I keep me some fire

[Repeat Chorus 2x]
