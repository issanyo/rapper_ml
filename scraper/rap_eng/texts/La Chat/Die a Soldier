[Chorus: DJ Paul]
I'd rather die a soldier, than nigga live a coward
I'd rather die a soldier, than nigga live a coward
I'd rather die a soldier, than nigga live a coward
I'd rather die a soldier, than nigga live a coward
I'd rather die a soldier, than nigga live a coward
I'd rather die a soldier, than nigga live a coward
I'd rather die a soldier, than nigga live a coward

[Verse 1: Lord Infamous]
Bullets are spitting alright
I will let the metal slide
I'm laying with late at night
The Hindu's state you will die
I know you ho's petrified
Cause Infamous set you right
With shotguns and falsty knives
That blow you clean out of sight
You're with all your might
Your conscious is staying by
You all in that sacrifice
I'm going to cut off your lights
I'm going off in the fight
The rope 'round your neck is tight
You pop out your fucking eyes
And that way you'll never cry, never cry

[Verse 2: La Chat]
Now, nigga how you gonna act like you
Didn't fuck up, so accept the fact
How many times have you've been warned
It's murder when you fuck with Chat
Don't need your sorrow or your pity
Should've thought before you did it
Ash to ash and dust to dust
Ya'll rest in peace
You know Chat when a motherfucker run on up
Yeah you's a great bitch
Just letting you know got thoughts of red
Oh, no remorse I buck you down with the .44
Never see my cowards
I got too much pride to let it ride
My nigga it's whatever
We can buck it out til one of us reach the sky

[Chorus: DJ Paul]
I'd rather die a soldier, than nigga live a coward
I'd rather die a soldier, than nigga live a coward
I'd rather die a soldier, than nigga live a coward
I'd rather die a soldier, than nigga live a coward
I'd rather die a soldier, than nigga live a coward
I'd rather die a soldier, than nigga live a coward
I'd rather die a soldier, than nigga live a coward
I'd rather die a soldier, than nigga live a coward

[Verse 3: Project Pat]
Coming like a duck-a
You know I came for trouble
Some thug wit' the crosser
Hollow let a bust-a
The hood for the money
Coming from a junkie
Your nose kinda runny
You feel like a mummy
Your pockets are crummy
But mine's getting phatter
Your lips gettin' blacker
To me, it don't matter
You pay what you owe-a
Player oh fa' show-a
True mentality of a ghetto soldier

[Verse 4: T-Rock]
Don't never get next to me
Although platinum thugging is my pedigree
I calculate my weapons to killing is my recipe
Bless it be, my militant Memphis when in jeopardy
Testing me, I blast him and he opens like sesame
West it be, a much bigger man than what they measure me
My mother and my rifle are my only 2 treacheries
Best believe, a singular shot you plead heavily
Never breathe, I guess a casket was his destiny

[Chorus: DJ Paul]
I'd rather die a soldier, than nigga live a coward
I'd rather die a soldier, than nigga live a coward
I'd rather die a soldier, than nigga live a coward
I'd rather die a soldier, than nigga live a coward
I'd rather die a soldier, than nigga live a coward
I'd rather die a soldier, than nigga live a coward
I'd rather die a soldier, than nigga live a coward
I'd rather die a soldier, than nigga live a coward

[Verse 5: Crunchy Black]
I got a problem
Money, dividends, gotta solve them
I heard you niggas, they out to rob me
I can't let 'em get me bro
I can't let 'em get me
No, I gotta stand ten toes down
I got keep a strap on me
I make sure no phony catch me cornered
Out here on that street life
I'd rather die a soldier than a coward any night

[Verse 6: Gangsta Boo]
How you wanna do it
How you wanna take it
You gon' wake up naked in the bed with Satan
Shaken, waking up and shit
Bitch, I betcha when the tech be pointed at ya
Maybe you will catch a fucking bullet
Never pistol playing, never, bitch
Bitch, I'd rather be soldier than a coward any day
Bitch, I'd rather smoke a hydro watch my cash flow anyway
Call me Gangsta, Gangsta, never fuck me, thank ya
If you ain't no man, with no cheese ask some niggas who know me

[Verse 7: M.C. Mack]
Sitting back, contemplating, waiting for another bitch to slip
I'm living on the verge
That's where I stay, strapped with them pistol grips
I never ever come up short
When it's time to jack a rudy poo
Just place the thing up to his brain
Bitch, I'm M.C. Mack, I'll close your shop
Trick, you devoured
I'd rather go out like soldier
Than even fuck off with you cowards
Come up on me, run up on me
Nigga, like you got some anna
Play that role like you so buck
And Kamikaze gonna find ya
They better remind ya

[Verse 8: Scanman]
Kamikaze's dark, nigga
Quiet, nigga
Don't play me, nigga
I don't give fuck, nigga
Test me if you wanna, nigga
Slugs gonna hit you, nigga
Leave you in a gutter. nigga
Police ain't gon' find me, nigga
'Cause I'm long gone, nigga
Should've listened to me, nigga
Told you, I'm a testy, nigga
[?] dead, niggas
Called on by the Scanman, nigga
We be like whatever, nigga
Whoop ya Kaze style, nigga
If you want us, come get us
Come bring it to the camp, nigga
