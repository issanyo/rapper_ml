I'm sick and tried of coward bitches taking advantage of me
I told these hoes that I can't go I grip my chrome three-eighty
I keep my distance from these bitches cause they are with that shit
Ain't got no choice these hoes be clicking
La Chat can't fuck with no bitch
I'd rather kick it by my lonely cause I'm all that I need
I'd rather kick it by my lonely cause I don't share my weed
You see most of these niggas
See they do not know
Gone call La Chat that come with flow that make you kick in them does
So most of you hoes that be trying to run dope
Fuck'em hong'em by the rope befoe I grab you in a chock
Tossing foties hold up shorty niggas there ain't no love
Don't give a fuck bout what you say and I don't play with that bud
I'm hitting a seven on my row cause you can't fuck with a mac
If you fuck up no hesitation I'm gone go get my gat
I got my block I slang my rocks
I'm now busting down them streets
That chick so hot my baby daddy got the vest watching me

(chorus) 2x's
Hoes can be like niggas
And pull triggas slang
Dope up on a curb and
Droppin bodies in the river
I said
Hoes can be like niggas
And pull triggas slang
Dope up on a curb and
Droppin bodies in the river playa


My everyday race is different places
Yeah I'm about that chedder
When I got my Glock my drank and smoke I'm guaranteed to feel better
A real true thug ass bumping slugs
Ain't got no ho in my blood
These fake ass bitches throwing falses so I show them no love
Ol' shit tell my why these bitches be bringing me ana
They must don't know where I stay
So strapped on situations I handle
We could be feddy
I be ready to release out these slugs
You pump your nuts its going down
Bitch you better be strapped up
Hoes you should think before you start
Cause once you start I'm gone finish
I guarantee your so called niggas ain't gone want to get in it
Can't catch me slipping
You fucked up I keep ny nine in my truck
They call me that psycho bitch that't leaving you dead on your porch
A bad ass bitch that's making sure
I'm teaching all hoes a lesson
Muthafuck a friend
I don't need no friend
My friend is spim'em west'in
Grab that skee mask off my dresser and that rifle to get ya
Just letting you know that I'm the bitch with no decision but kill ya

(chorus) 2x's
