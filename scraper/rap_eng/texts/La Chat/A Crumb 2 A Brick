[Hook] x1
I flip a crumb 2 a brick
A brick 2 some rocks
Some rocks 2 a juice
(Now we chopping up them for food)
A chevy 2 a lac
A lac 2 a vet
A vet 2 a benz
(With this dough we makin' ends nigga)
I flip a crumb 2 a brick
A brick 2 some rocks
Some rocks 2 a juice
(Now we chopping up them for food)
A chevy 2 a lac
A lac 2 a vet
A vet 2 a benz
(With this dough we makin' ends nigga)

[Verse 1]
You can call Mrs. Serv On, cause I get my hustle on
Looking for some donkey kong, got me blowing up my phone
So you wanna get along, got no money but you (?)
I'mma break you off a crumb, leave me in the early morn'
Always trapped up with a tone, Always shoot you when you gone
All you robbers got me wrong, I will show up at yo' home
Gotta make my money job, Fuck wit me and you'll be gone
Always striking for they call, La' Chat gotta make it known
I be bout' that money mayn, For the top is where I am
I don't play no looser games, Niggas always say my name
Shit I be the one to blame, When they ain't to booming thangs
In these streets they got to fight, Mayn you know I can't be lien'
Always strugglin' for they chains, Try my best to maintain
Watch them shoot it in they thang, It be throbbin' in the brain
I be causing plenty pain, (?)
Servin to much cocaine, Theya'll gone love me when I'm game

[Hook] x1

[Verse 2]
I be posted on the tracks, Slanging rocks back-to-back
Shit I even fuck with packs, Everybody know La' Chat
Mayn I'm gone make a kill, Flip from rocks to servin' deals
Catch me on the corner still, Cause I'm out to make a mill'
Niggas thinkin' that I'm heavy, Cause I'm ridin in there chevy
(?) cause I'm sweaty, Got that ho bumped down and ready
I'm a bitch about that skrilla, Got more work than half you niggas
Just to keep it on the realla, I'm a buy a drug dealer
Thuggin' on yo' fuckin block, Keep my eye up on the narks
I ain't tryin to make it hot, So I get from spot to spot
Got to keep my 9 on me, Always ready fo' some heat
I don't know if you got beef, It's so hot out in the streets
But this how I choose to live, Thanks the lord to be forgived
This is how I pay my bills, This is how I eat a meal
I would give it up one day, When that day I can not say
Cause I feel I'm livin' straight, Slangin' dope what keep me paid
