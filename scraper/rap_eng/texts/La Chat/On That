On that thug shit
On that drug shit
On that bullshit
On that devil shit

[Verse 1: Lil Wyte]
Pocket full of drugs stumbling in the party
I'll kidnap your ho and take her straight to Molly
Take pictures with every bitch that's up in that party
Put every bitch in that party on that same fucking Molly
Rock out with my cock out
They can jam out with they're clams out
Me and Gangsta Boo up in this motherfucker
Getting loose in this ho 'bout to jam out
We back up on that thuggin' druggin' boolin' devil shit
This some of that 2036 MAFIA mix level shit
On point like shark senses
Fuck with me my homies will smell the blood
On a one way ticket to hell you headed
Beheaded with me no love
I got real killers that did real time at all times on my left and right
Better think twice when you fuck with Lil Wyte
An extended clip can fuck up your night
Alright?

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Gangsta Boo]
I'm smoking like a motherfucker and I'm going crazy
Riding with Wyte with a bitch with no babies
Y'all already know I'm back up on that ratchet shit
Get wrong one time leave ya in a ditch
Bumpin' that new triple six
You niggas y'all know what it is
You high and you gone off them pills
That's why I'm just keeping it real
I'm back on that old ass I don't give a fuck type legendary status
I ain't gotta come with no hype
99 problems but you hoes ain't one
I don't fuck with ya I just fuck with y'all for fun
I'm doing shit you can't
I be all up in the bank
Looking like a million dollars smelling like a pound of dank
Aye!

[Hook]

[Verse 3: La Chat]
Yeah, I'm a thug bitch
You drugs bitch
I love the hood and my folks be on that bullshit
Gone catch you slippin' so don't play in Memphis
We 'bout that life so get right
Hope you pay attention
Them goons they be lurkin' they come out at night
Mayne for yo' pockets then yo' wallet they will take yo' life
Clubbin' druggin' thuggin' all the way until the sunny light
Party's at my house we live as hell 4sho we'll get you right
Blowing nothing but herbs through my lungs got my mind blown
Dip it in that drank my words slurred now I'm super throwed
Fuck it, it ain't nothing else to do, so I hit up Boo
We so with the shit it ain't no telling what we finna' do
We thuggin!
