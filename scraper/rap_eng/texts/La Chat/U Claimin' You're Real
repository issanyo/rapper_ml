[Chorus]
Bitch you claimin yo real

[Verse 1: La Chat]
I got these bitches jockin me cuz I stay on they mind
I'm strickly dickly while you lickin I don't fuck with ya kind
Yeah you's a weak ho fuck ya
Ain't no love for ya ass
You fuck with me you talk that shit I hope you ready to blast
It be these ugly bitches talkin always sayin my name
It be these ugly bitches fuckin all these niggas for fame
A big mistake is when you fuck up and you fuck with La Chat
Your ass is coward as some ????? cuz I do not play that
You in my face bitch talkin I don't pay you no tention
I got you hot cuz everytime you speak my name it get mention
You tellin sad story lies everything just to kick it
You don't get the picture yet stupid bitch I ain't listenin
La Chat I'm strapped I'm stayin focused got ya ass figured out
You keep on talkin watch out ho 12 gauge slug in yo mouth
A real bitch you done ran across you better be scared
Cuz La Chat don't give a fuck about doin time in the fed

[Chorus]
Bitch you claimin yo real

[Verse 2: Project Pat]
I'm Mr. ride on these bitches who talk that shit to me
A homicide on these bitches, a murder in the street
Hypnotize, stackin' riches and you ain't got a dime
Poppin' slugs into snitches cuz I ain't doin' time
Project Pat, I'm in this mutha, I know you hear this shit
I shot yo dog and yo brother, you betta feel this shit
Niggas hatin' undercover but smiles in my mug
Coward ass motherfuckers - I'll smoke you like some bud
I got that thang cocked and ready, to hell with some peace
Cookin' beef like spaghetti - a blood recipe
Suckas need to get some cheddar, my name out ya cap
But you gets a bloody sweater, a permanent nap
All this dissin' in your rappin' just shows you's a ho
All this talkin' and this flappin', I let some bullets flow
Through the air to your d-izz-ome, connectin' the dots
Meet your end from the chr-izz-ome, the Glock hit the spot

[Chorus]
Bitch you claimin yo real

[Verse 3: La Chat]
Look at me ho, I'm smilin, but you know ain't no love
You turn that smile upside down
Bitch and what you see is my mug
Now Imma break it down so plain
And I'm gonna make it so simple
You in the wrong and now its on
The Mossberg pump to your temple
See I don't fuck with bitches bitch I kick it with the thugs
And I be ???????? hoes like you and keep it on the hush hush
You wanna witness what I issue wanna see I ain't playin
La Chat won't ???? now ho so what the fuck is you sayin
Now this the bizness motherfucker first I need me a witness
Jump with that thang ready to bang I got whoever get in it
I told you bitches once before you hoes ain't ready for anna
Don't give a fuck shit mane whats up I'm buckin bitches at random
I'm makin it known in everyway La Chat ain't barrin no hoes
And for you niggas fuck you too I'm buckin holes thru the doe
I hope you think that I'm a bitch thats only talkin that shit
I show your ass that I'm a ho get make up everywhere bitch

[Repeat Chorus]
