Drop em in the trunk lock em in trunk real fast you'll be flying

{Juicy J}
We bout to ride on these fools cock these nines on these fools (x2)

{DJ Paul}
Like thisssssssssss
Now in my city its some real in my city its some fake
Got some niggas that's gone play got some niggas that's gone hate
Got some niggas that's gone dis the treal niggas on the tape
But them the ones who want the streets so they start to evaporate
That's why them niggas ain't around no more
Cause them niggas couldn't sell no more
Without the Hypnotize or the Prophet nigga you is no more
Got plaques up on my walls
Got 20's on my cars
Keep coming like you coming and I'm gonna show you
I ain't fucked up bout no charge nigga

{Juicy J}
Can you niggas feel my pain
Catch me standing in the rain
Holding on a rusty tool
Bout to act a fuckin fool
Is the 6 the devil though
Make you wanna powder your nose
Have you smoking hydro weed
Satisfaction guaranteed
Bucking wild and throwing signs
Knowing these niggas done loss they minds
Blame it on Caribbean, Ooh
When we cock them thangs and shoot
Thinking somebody had seen my face
Neva gon' catch a murder case
Just gonna beat him round for round and leave him in the river to drown

{[DJ Paul] Crunchy Black}
[They try to]
We bout to ride on these fools cock these nines on these fools (x4)

{DJ Paul: talking}
Hahaha y'all niggas still don't understand
Nigga look around motherfucker look the fuck around you
And see who you see nigga all you see is me
Hypnotized C-A-M-motherfuckin-P bitch
Come on come on keep it coming keep it coming keep it coming

{Project Pat}
So you wanna try-a
Nigga with the nine-a
Creep up from behind ya
Like I'm a sunridah
Shoot ya in your spine-a
Slap ya like a minor
Patch out your hizead
Slug bloody rizeed
Staying on the low low
Hating that's a no no
Duck taping trick up
In the trunk you go go
You gon' shake and shiver
Pain I deliver
Kidnapping fools throw they body in the river

{Koopsta Knicca}
Let get this on
You think I just piss off them fuckin sluts then a
The streets auto traffic gonna fuck you up but now
I had to tremble quick cause he bump with it
Got some midgets in my clizick now I'm pimping bitch
My friends have brand new teams
Twenties hundred ain't she motherfuckin funny
North Memphis come we catching everything and money
Home at night keep my motherfuckin eyes open
Cause last night I'm dealing with the fedz in the corner store

{Crunchy Black}
Yo yo yo yo yo yo yo
I locked em in the trunk
And dropped they bodies off
See cash in B.Z. you get that sawed off funk
Point to your head and then left someone dead
Then try that with thugs and be half out your head
See messing with me is like messing with the fedz
See messing with me is like being halfway dead
Most niggas don't walk my path I done already laid
Put 2 in the gun and flex so I won't be in that resting place

{Lord Infamous}
Don't make me get ignant,feel the incision,arsenic fragments,dagger is jaggin'
Poison and lashes, 2000 hazardous
Can you imagine, me with the Magnum
Fire breathing dragon, blow away the ashes
What the fuck happen, torture and trap them
Satan is digging, Scarecrow premonition
The world is ending, please make a decision

{LaChat}
Mayn fuck that shit
Go get that bitch and throw her ass in my trunk
That infrared net be getting her head
She make more sounds and she dumped
Where the fuck the evidence bitch
Only heat for my witness
You think I'm playing what you saying
LaChat ain't bout her business
I tote my Glock I keep it cocked
The .38 slug for a nigga
Could be my brother husband cousin
Fuck him I pull the trigger
Got no remorse won't sympathize
Ain't got no love in my soul
Don't fuck with me know who I be
LaChat that murdering ho

{T-Rock}
I got him running from my slugs wrath
Niggas get they mugs snapped
Licking shots from plastic Glocks
You marinate in blood baths
Ignorance leave my manner
Silently conceal the Anna
Ho I visualize your skull
And split it with the snipers scanner
Insert the cap in Glock
Gunpoint get faster props
Lock and load like master lock
And hit you for an aftershock
No mistake so meet your fate
Confiscate the paper chase
Triple 6 is running shit
Cooperate or we make you wait

{Lil Pat}
You's out there thinking we just bullshittin
About this shit gon' wind up interfering
Motherfuckers with they wig split
Laying there in a coma
That you just can't seem to come out of
Now you think a nigga still playing
Bitch what's up cuz
Like I always said
I'm gonna tell you once and ain't no more
I think I done made it clear enough
On how these ballers like the road
I'll have you know again
Don't mess with me when I get full-of-that funk
Or you gonna find yourself locked in the fuckin' trunk

{Juicy J}
(background mixed)
Drop em in the trunk lock em in trunk real fast you'll be flying
