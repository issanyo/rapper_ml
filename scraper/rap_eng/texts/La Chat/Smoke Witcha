[Juicy J]
Yeah, you niggas about to witness somethin'
You have witnessed before you know what I'm sayin'?

[La Chat: Chorus]
All I wanna do is just smoke wit cha smoke wit cha
Break down da weed smoke dope wit cha dope wit cha
All I wanna do is just drank wit cha drank wit cha
Get drunk, pass out, and faint wit cha faint wit cha (x2)

[Verse 1: La Chat]
It's been a long night I ain't got a apetite
So full and gone off dem muthafuckin' Bud Lights
Can't even lie I be drunk (shit) full of dem beers
Get cho ass on nuthin' but drankers kick it ova hurr (here)
Come on and join gimmie some mayne it's goin' down
My head is spinnin' super fast ain't no stoppin' now
At the level now I'm searchin' for da marijuana
Can't find no dro' now I'm sick on grandma's last Corona
Heniken be my friend mixed wit' juice n' gin
The way I drink it let me know it is my favorite sin
That Icehouse (oo) I'm strung out on da couch
Before I leave I'm guaranteed to take a nigga mouth
And what chu know about dat Red Dog? Fuck yall
That shit don't play it have you runnin' up da fuckin' wall
I drank until the circum up who da fuck is able
Step up I jump yo' ass under da fuckin' table

[La Chat: Chorus]
All I wanna do is just smoke wit cha smoke wit cha
Break down da weed smoke dope wit cha dope wit cha
All I wanna do is just drank wit cha drank wit cha
Get drunk, pass out, and faint wit cha faint wit cha (x1)

[La Chat: Verse 2]
I'm hollerin' at a dude say "Roll up some mo' to smoke"
Try to keep my cool, but "damn dis some good dope"
"Wanna roll a joint?", "naw dog rollin' optimo"
"Well wanna go smoke?", "i ain't smokin' inless it's dro'"
Love to get high when I'm flexin' in my ride
I keep my mean mug for da hatas outside
You wanna get up wit' me all you gotta do is hit me
I keep my two-way jumpin' gotta keep my pimpin'
I'm full of dat pure, mayne we gone off dat grunja
Drunk off dat beer, system full of marijuana
Tryin' to hit my weed, but La Chat ain't got nuttin' for ya'
Can't smoke for free, so I'm gonna holla at cha
I'm creepin' through da hood niggas try to flag me down
I throw da W cuz' I'm Westwood bound
I'm feelin' good as hell mayne dis dro' has got me high
My daily routine is to smoke and ri-ide

[La Chat: Chorus]
All I wanna do is just smoke wit cha smoke wit cha
Break down da weed smoke dope wit cha dope wit cha
All I wanna do is just drank wit cha drank wit cha
Get drunk, pass out, and faint wit cha faint wit cha
