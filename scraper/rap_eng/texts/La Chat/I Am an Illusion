[Hook]
I am an illusion, you ain't really seeing me
You ain't really seeing me, you ain't really seeing me
I am an illusion, you ain't really seeing me
You ain't really seeing me, you ain't really seeing me
So don't watch me, focus on your money
Focus on your money, focus on your money
So don't watch me, focus on your money
Focus on your money, focus on your money

[Verse 1: Waka Flocka Flame]
What I live for? (money)
What I die for? (my boys)
1017 Brick Squad, making all the noise
You can't tell me shit, buddy, so please stop calling
I am an illusion, so focus on your money, partner
Man, they scared of us, police search us in the club
Pussy ass nigga, you don't get no fucking love
Smoking purp, just the purp like my name was Sheist Bubz
In the club, not VIP, but thirty deep, I'm so thugging
Westwood, hanging with those Pirus, I'm so Blood
And Orange Mound, blowing on some orange kush
Flowing on a Luger track, mob style, where the bat?
If you fuck with La Chat, Waka Flocka Flame is back
Flocka

[Hook]
I am an illusion, you ain't really seeing me
You ain't really seeing me, you ain't really seeing me
I am an illusion, you ain't really seeing me
You ain't really seeing me, you ain't really seeing me
So don't watch me, focus on your money
Focus on your money, focus on your money
So don't watch me, focus on your money
Focus on your money, focus on your money

[Verse 2: La Chat]
While you bitches watching me, hoe, watch how La Chat get this money
I'm laughing at you bitches, 24's, I'm high and stunting
These hoes be out here hating, these hoes be out here faking
But soon as I hit the door, these weak ass hoes be out here shaking
But bitch, I'm always strapped, I'm gon' put holes off in your back
I told you hoes long time ago how I stay [?] off with that yak
And for sure, I'm gonna tag, ain't no hoe, bitch, I'm La Chat
Got the red beam and a mean team, come dressed up in all black
I'm a bitch that's legendary with a certified status
These boys be trying to holler, keep me in that dope boy magic
That break me off these stacks and they take me on these cruises
These bitches cannot see me or see Flocka, we illusions

[Hook]
I am an illusion, you ain't really seeing me
You ain't really seeing me, you ain't really seeing me
I am an illusion, you ain't really seeing me
You ain't really seeing me, you ain't really seeing me
So don't watch me, focus on your money
Focus on your money, focus on your money
So don't watch me, focus on your money
Focus on your money, focus on your money
