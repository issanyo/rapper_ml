[La Chat talking]
Mayne look uh hurr, I'm tired of all these micrphone killin' ass hoes
Yah know wha I'm talkin' bout'?
Da type of hoes das gon' run they mouth behind the muthafuckin' mic
But ain't gon' kill shit and ain't gon' let shit die
These studio gang-style hoes
Talkin' all dat muthafuckin' shit
Bitch bring dat shit on to tha doe' come on hoe
Come on let's go

[Chorus]
Don't sang it hoe (hoe)
You gotta bring it hoe (hoe)
Now don't be sangin' hoe (hoe)
You gotta bring it hoe (hoe)
Cuz' I'm da bitchy, da bitchy, bitchy
Da bitchy, bitchy, da bitchy, bitchy
Bitchy you love to hate
You think you know me bitch (bitch)
But you don't know me hoe (hoe)
You wanna start some shit den bring it to da doe'
Cuz' I'm da bitchy, da bitchy, bitchy
Da bitchy, bitchy, da bitchy, bitchy
Bitchy you love to hate

[Verse 1]
Da stout bitch, but I'm packin' da fat ass beer belly
Niggas wanna get in my shit, but they ain't ready
If it's somethin' you wanna get den go get it
If I'm not strapped den I'm packin' da mesheti
I don't give a fuck cut chu' bitches up like spaghetti
Shootin' off 70 rounds so don't test me
I'm out hurr just doin' my thang, you gon' let me
I'ma keep keepin' it real, so don't sweat it
Fight a bitch over a nigga I ain't petty
Put em' in da trunk wit' da bump of da chevy
Holla at my brother Big Steady das so heavy
He be droppin' pounds of dat shit wit' no waitin'
See yo' gurl den pushed it and she ridin' da big boi Expy
Hooked up wit' da Hypnotized Camp so don't hate me
Shall not play no games when it come to dat ghetty
I don't love none of you bitches, you ain't steady

[Chorus]
Don't sang it hoe (hoe)
You gotta bring it hoe (hoe)
Now don't be sangin' hoe (hoe)
You gotta bring it hoe (hoe)
Cuz' I'm da bitchy, da bitchy, bitchy
Da bitchy, bitchy, da bitchy, bitchy
Bitchy you love to hate
You think you know me bitch (bitch)
But you don't know me hoe (hoe)
You wanna start some shit den bring it to da doe'
Cuz' I'm da bitchy, da bitchy, bitchy
Da bitchy, bitchy, da bitchy, bitchy
Bitchy you love to hate

See I be roastin' hoes, but I will (?) fa sho
Hate to see yo' bitch to draw a crowd, I ain't gon' do nothin' doe'
For dat shit I got some manners to take it to da highest level

If my crew don't come dat mean I'm comin' wit' grenades fool
Ain't no need in watchin' me you betta watch yo' back hoe
Tell yo' mammy to lock da doe' and keep da fuckin' curtains closed
Push rewind and listen good again before you get done in
