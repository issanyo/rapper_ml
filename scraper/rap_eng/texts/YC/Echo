[Verse 1: hidingtobefound]
I’ve been talking to my skeletons
Discussing proper etiquette
Pretty evident, don’t have to say I’m feeling dead again
Whether it’s the weather I’ve been weathering
This medicine’s irrelevant when all you said
Instead is left inside my head (I guess)

I had to become another casualty
Dancing through your galaxy, death the only gravity
You’d second guess and ask the rest when I was half asleep
Meander through this afterlife, I guess it had to be

Me and you sitting like its tea for two
Time it never lasted, only passed us like we seem to do
I never meant those things I said
And never said what I was meaning to
Glass between our grasps, we couldn’t see it through

No there's nothing left here, choking on regret, dear
No needle pulling thread, I reckon just a wreck instead
We’re on a lonely road not even god’ll know
He’s never really audible
Besides, I don’t know why, but he never shows

[Hook: hidingtobefound]
All I hear is the echo
We dug the grave where the rest goes
You saw the fire in my eyes when we’d lie awake at night
Until the aching would subside
All I hear is the echo
We dug the grave where the rest goes
You saw the fire in my eyes when we’d lie awake at night
Until the aching would subside
But we let go

[Verse 2: hidingtobefound]
They think I’m mental
I’m not like them, though
Just trying to find the fragments of whats left and assemble
You should’ve chased me to the depths
They were just a couple steps
That I had missed, now the quietness in my chest grows

No guessing, it’s repetitive
So give in to the negative embedded in my head
But never mentioned it
Eyes heavy, and I’m blinded by my envy
Lying on my bed again, wrapped up in the emptiness

Been watching colors on my TV
I guess it’s noisy static on a repeat
Television visions vivid all that lingers twisted into
Insignificance with my existence on a bleak screen

Cause I’ve been on display
And honestly, I’m coughing up these Namastes
Here I stand and as I bow to the divine in you
My mind rewinds and I’m unglued
I guess I lied to you, cause now I’d stay
