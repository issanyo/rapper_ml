AYEEEE
Shout out G Herbo man
AYEEEE
AYEEEE

[Verse]
Everything I did everything I do
Strictly for the money never for the fame
Rap for the money trap for the money
When it come to cash try do anything
Since my uncle died I've been down to ride
Took his own life real suicide
That's when I was six last time I cried
Might be traumatized think of homicides
Chasing after cash focused on the prize
Posted on the block me and all the guys
Selling bitches dreams tell them bitches lies
Take em out to eat burgers and some fries
Ray-Bans on my eyes 40 by my side
Gotta stay alert even when I'm high
Molly in my body I ain't scared to die
Nigga this your chance better use it wise
Sneak dissing niggas fucking up the game
Niggas only tough when they think you lame
Come around me everything change
Bitches don't speak niggas tucking chains
Imma change the game one way or another
Owe it to my muvah owe it to my bruvahs
Imma take a chance with this rap shit
If it don't work back to selling butters
Right back on the block I ain't on the couch
Back to pushing weight like I'm working out
OG got bricks we can build a house
Duct tape lips I don't run my mouth
Mickey ass niggas wanna be a mouse
How you niggas get respect where you from
Tsunami your block I'll wet where you from
I got killers I tell where you at and they come
My niggas hungry we need a dinner plate
I'm trynna make a way niggas just in the way
Wasn't paying attention in school I had better things
Was a bad ass I got kicked out the seventh grade
Took my lil woeder he ain't make it seventeen
Pray to Allah hope he open up heaven gates
Pray to Allah hope he send me some better days
Ride in the Chevrolet I want an Escalade
I used to sleep on the floor I ain't gone lie niggas use to be poor
That's the same reason I stopped asking niggas for shit
And I just started kicking they door
Aye I can not show no remorse these niggas some whores
They ain't did what I did niggas still had a curfew
When my niggas jumped off the porch
Had to stop popping them xans made me forget bout my enemies
Paranoid thought my niggas was friendnemies
Momma asked me what the fuck was gettin' into me
Started shooting niggas just for the energy
When I was broke niggas used to be stingey
Now you can't call me for more than a penny
And my PO want me working at a Wendy's
I'm still on probation for toting my semi
