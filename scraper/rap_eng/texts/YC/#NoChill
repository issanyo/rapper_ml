And These people can Be hating

All You Nikkaz Check Da Clock Cause Your Time Is Up On The Wall

If She Flat Then You better know i won't stare

She Date a Rapper ale ko kasi Wa boaster
Now She Too Attached She also Wanna be on posters
An I told Aro jika daa Ko Dollar
Re reke Sphatlo maybe Le twizza ya Cola
After daar Re kano Jika ko Sabona
Show yu pheli an I'm talking every Corner
I can tell By your Looks That your Ex ne ao bora
