[Hook: hidingtobefound]
You were the light
You’d ignite like the night sky into day from the nighttime
And we’d fly like some kites, high
Goodbye’s never quite right, but it seemed like the right time

[Verse 1: hidingtobefound]
I’d feel you when you said it, love instead of empty rhetoric
But now I’m feeling copacetic cause the sedative is setting in
Here’s hoping that we meant it, now I’m headed for the medicine
For coping with genetics left inside my empty head again

Mind over matter when my mind didn’t matter
But define "automatic" when I'd lie still and panic
We could lie still and plan it, it but it died, what we’d planted
Buy time for a dime; who is mine on this planet?

Tilt leads to shift as we’re all circling the sun
New seasons insist before the others have begun
If no meaning exists, there’s no reason for this
My mouth was pleading the fifth while I was biting on my tongue

And daily you were mating with that high-low
Rapid cycle psychobabble battles, check your vitals
Constant flux or constant tidal waves goodbye
We’re the same, insane
Sing the day away, a waste recital

[Hook]

[Verse 2: hidingtobefound]

That optimist consciousness
Walked it with cautiousness
You waltzed in and offered to
Talk with my conscience while
I’d barter with god, still it’s godlessness I’d insist
You honestly promised the longest when I’d persist

And pieces of our perfect little verses
Turned to gazes intercepted and diverted
Still accept it as our worser fate, we faded in the cursed words of the serpent
Ate it like it aided in the weightlessness of the short term


This sinner’s inner synergy was the single winter made the winner of the inner we
We could be or flee, but still beginners of this spring, I think we’d better leave
Better off biting off the bitter half than betting everything

So day to day, un-sink our teeth and fade away
Way to make the days decay and
Sway away the sympathy
You'd find us in the dark where we’d play the part
Fly us half-mast on the ship then we'd disembark

[Hook]
