[Intro: YC]
Racks, racks, racks, racks, racks

[Chorus: Slim Dunkin, YC & Derez De'Shon]
I wipe my ass with fifties and blow my nose with hundreds (racks)
And I don't fuck with twenties, I keep this shit a hundred (racks)
I wipe my ass with fifties and blow my nose with hundreds (racks)
And I don't fuck with twenties, I keep this shit a hundred (racks)
Bitch, I'm 'bout them hundreds (hundreds)
Bitch, I'm 'bout them hundreds (hundreds)
Bitch, I'm 'bout them hundreds (hundreds)
Bitch, I'm 'bout them hundreds (hundreds)
Bitch, I'm 'bout them hundreds
Bitch, I'm 'bout them hundreds
Bitch, I'm 'bout them hundreds
I said bitch, I'm 'bout them hundreds

[Verse 1: Slim Dunkin & Derez De'Shon]
I keep this shit a hundred
I'm freezing, this cost me
Foggy ass diamonds, boy, your chain need defrosting
Dunk on the block, make them plays, Randy Moss-ing
Think I found my mojo, call me Powers Austin
Austin Powers kush, hasta luego
Pockets stuffed burritos, still Block Illegal
Stop flexing with them ones, use them tens to wipe my baby butt
Counting all these hundreds, man, I think I got a papercut
True Religion fiend, talking robbing, ain't concerning me
More horseshoes than the Q-Dog fraternity
Y'all two step, I just let my pockets dance
Dunkovia, Wells Fargo in my pants

[Chorus: Slim Dunkin, YC & D-Bo]
I wipe my ass with fifties and blow my nose with hundreds (racks)
And I don't fuck with twenties, I keep this shit a hundred (racks)
I wipe my ass with fifties and blow my nose with hundreds (racks)
And I don't fuck with twenties, I keep this shit a hundred (racks)
Bitch, I'm 'bout them hundreds (hundreds)
Bitch, I'm 'bout them hundreds (hundreds)
Bitch, I'm 'bout them hundreds (hundreds)
Bitch, I'm 'bout them hundreds (hundreds)
Bitch, I'm 'bout them hundreds
Bitch, I'm 'bout them hundreds
Bitch, I'm 'bout them hundreds
I said bitch, I'm 'bout them hundreds

[Verse 2: YC]
YC, YC
Fuck a fifty, need nothing but some hundreds
Ain't talking about weed, just money
Hundreds got a nigga this fly, now I'm [?] talk cash
Hell yeah, bitch, I love to talk about money
Playing with the cash, never glance at a tag
Feeling like Fab, just throw it in the bag
They throwing up the cash, they running through racks
They running through bands, they blowing on gas
Double cup, love sipping on lean
Keep bands in the pockets of my jeans
Got work, but it's all for the fiends
[?] ain't talking about beans
Brand new Chevy, yeah, just bought that
Wet paint, set it on some offsets
Can't nag a bad bitch that I ain't caught yet
Wanna talk these racks? Yeah, I'm 'bout that
No twenties, just fifties and hundreds
Big play shit, yeah, we been getting money
My nigga, don't flex, they keep it one hundred
What you talking 'bout, Willis? My sack like the Drummonds
YC, Jody Breeze, Slim Dunkin
If you ain't talking money, you ain't talking nothing
Racks on racks got a young nigga buzzing
YC, YC

[Chorus: Slim Dunkin, YC & D-Bo]
I wipe my ass with fifties and blow my nose with hundreds (racks)
And I don't fuck with twenties, I keep this shit a hundred (racks)
I wipe my ass with fifties and blow my nose with hundreds (racks)
And I don't fuck with twenties, I keep this shit a hundred (racks)
Bitch, I'm 'bout them hundreds (hundreds)
Bitch, I'm 'bout them hundreds (hundreds)
Bitch, I'm 'bout them hundreds (hundreds)
Bitch, I'm 'bout them hundreds (hundreds)
Bitch, I'm 'bout them hundreds
Bitch, I'm 'bout them hundreds
Bitch, I'm 'bout them hundreds
I said bitch, I'm 'bout them hundreds

[Verse 3: Jody Breeze]
'Bout them hundreds, Breeze act a fool
Think I'm playing? Hit the mall, couple grand on some shoes
Damn, a hundred grand on some jewels
And I don't even wear them, I gave them to my goons
Chris got racks on racks on racks
Yeah, I got straps on straps on straps
So pimp, don't trip, don't trip, don't trip
'Cause you can get clapped, get clapped, get capped
Got a .45 and I call that Chrome, beam all over your dome
Yes, I'm gone off that lean, I'm smoking on this Irene
Can't fuck with the flow, you know that
Been getting money, nigga, blow that
Say you a player, where your hoe at? Claim her 'cause I ain't finna cut a bitch no slack
I blow my nose with twenties, I wipe my ass with fifties
'Cause I'm stacking hundreds and I'm on my hustle, Nipsey

[Chorus: Slim Dunkin, YC & D-Bo]
I wipe my ass with fifties and blow my nose with hundreds (racks)
And I don't fuck with twenties, I keep this shit a hundred (racks)
I wipe my ass with fifties and blow my nose with hundreds (racks)
And I don't fuck with twenties, I keep this shit a hundred (racks)
Bitch, I'm 'bout them hundreds (hundreds)
Bitch, I'm 'bout them hundreds (hundreds)
Bitch, I'm 'bout them hundreds (hundreds)
Bitch, I'm 'bout them hundreds (hundreds)
Bitch, I'm 'bout them hundreds
Bitch, I'm 'bout them hundreds
Bitch, I'm 'bout them hundreds
I said bitch, I'm 'bout them hundreds

[Outro: Slim Dunkin]
I wipe my ass with fifties, blow my nose with hundreds
And I don't fuck with twenties, I keep this shit a hundred
I wipe my ass with fifties and blow my nose with hundreds
And I don't fuck with twenties, I keep this shit a hundred
Bitch, I'm 'bout them hundreds
