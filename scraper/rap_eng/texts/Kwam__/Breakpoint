[Intro]
Come on
Should've made that ball
Damn it
What next?
OK
You know what?
I've got this

Yeah, now and again we see stuff go pear-shaped
It's all part of the life, that's fair play
Sometimes, fate's gonna throw down bare rain
Just so you can appreciate clear days
If you let your pulse and your hair raise
Too high to the point where you can't stare straight
That's a bad move and I dare say
If that's what they're on, it won't be their day
Not gonna win through losing your rag
You better [?] do to the back
Can't say [?]
Are you grown up or a yout in a pram?
Not gonna win through losing your cool
If it's that, you'll just be losing the duel
Strengthen your mindset, make it a rule
Don't tell a lie, don, don't be a fool
Now and again, we see stuff go wrong
It's all part of the life, get along
Sometimes, fate will make the wind strong
Just so you can appreciate when it's gone
If you lift your voice and your tone up too high
To the point where you just go nuts
You're not gonna scare any grown-ups
You're just gonna look like you're a doughnut
Not gonna win by waving your arms
Not gonna win by taking your garms off
I'm sure you think you're not but you are lost
More so than the newborn of a castoff
Not gonna win by waving your tongue
Not gonna win by screaming your lungs out
I guess you might be good for the one round
Carry that forward, though, you'll get run down

[Chorus]
When you're at breakpoint
You need to stay calm when the crowd make noise
Trust in the strength of your mind and voice
Keep on swinging out, don't get annoyed
Yeah, when the heat comes on
You need to stand firm on your feet, no long
Please don't be scared to get things wrong
Anyting ah anyting, life goes on, so
When you're at breakpoint
You need to stay calm when the crowd make noise
Trust in the strength of your mind and voice
Keep on swinging out, don't get annoyed
Yeah, when the heat comes on
You need to stand firm on your feet, no long
Please don't be scared to get things wrong
Anyting ah anyting, life goes on

[Verse 2]
One time, I was at breakpoint too
Looking for the exit, didn't have a clue
Thought to myself "shit, what do I do?"
Doesn't look good but I don't wanna lose
If you ever get that thought, stop right there
If you're thinking that you flopped right there
Don't wanna lose so you can't ever win
May as well chuck all your hopes in the bin
Me, I take loss with a smile and a grin
Life still carries on, it's not a thing
If a guy battled and came up short
Well it is what is, then it's not a ting
You will never see me making a din
When I lose, I take defeat straight on the chin
I go home and I work in my dojo
True, I don't need any mates in the gym
I've been at breakpoint more than once
Everybody has, though, many men front
Don't lie to yourself when you're trapped in the funcs
Say bye to your health if you're gonna just stunt
Going on big when you're really a runt
I'm like how are you meant to get larger?
Real talk, how are you meant to get harder?
Man start running their gums and get carved up
Totally turned all over the gaffe
Confusion all over their tracks
It was always gonna be this way, they went mad
Messed up every last chance that they had
When you lose your focus, I'm afraid that's that
In a flash, you'll have your face on the mat
If you'll never learn concentration lacks
You're gonna flop, that's a blatant fact
Me, I don't fret when I'm under the cosh
I keep calm when the storm clouds come across
You will never show a man fear of a loss
What's more, I may be mad, pull it off
Walk with my head high like I'm a toff
Walk cause I know what I'm capable of
Might see a one sweat bead on the brow
I rarely back down when I'm placed on the spot
Feels like I'm made for the pressure
So many times, I've got 'em smiling
Next man are reaching the end of their tether
It's been this way for a while
I swear down, you lot have got to come better
You can't be so easily riled
What you shouting your mouth for? That's not clever
Might see [?] a bit, not on this fella

[Chorus]
When you're at breakpoint
You need to stay calm when the crowd make noise
Trust in the strength of your mind and voice
Keep on swinging out, don't get annoyed
Yeah, when the heat comes on
You need to stand firm on your feet, no long
Please don't be scared to get things wrong
Anyting ah anyting, life goes on, so
When you're at breakpoint
You need to stay calm when the crowd make noise
Trust in the strength of your mind and voice
Keep on swinging out, don't get annoyed
Yeah, when the heat comes on
You need to stand firm on your feet, no long
Please don't be scared to get things wrong
Anyting ah anyting, life goes on

[Outro]
You get me?
When you feel the heat on your neck
Stick to what you know
See me when I'm at breakpoint down?
I just go out wide in the serve, pull him into the tramlines and volley it into the open court
And if it don't work, I lose the game
If it works, I'm still in there swinging, baby
Yeah
