[Verse 1: AJ Tracey]
AJ from the lane, but I'm no hero
Said that you have straps but you've got zero
Me and PK bring the coffee, Nero
Us man are really on the pitch, sincero
AJ from the lane, but I'm still D-low
I weren't on the mic, I was tryna get kilos
Bare chicks giving man love like Bebo
You man are jokers, Dandy and Beano

[Verse 2: PK]
The Mexican black Chinese ombré
When you see me then man move shake
When you see me then man move snake
I'll open your face with my brand new blade
Blade, blade, ombré
When you see me, then man move shake
When you see me then man move snake
I'll open your face with my brand new blade

Kill 'em when I'm spitting a written, you know I shell that

[Verse 4: Lyrical Strally]
Yo, L Strally here, when I spray, I'm sure
That's every man tanned, Geordie Shore
Can't act like a badman in Shoreditch
Washed MCs get ditched on the shore

I'mma drop this one here
Droppin' it, couldn't be restricted here
Show you powers of the mystic breh
Challenge me, then you will witness fear
Hit 'em like a lightning bolt, Ixion's here
Get them, now they wanna switch their careers
No reception when they spit, who cares?
Can't let myself be a myth, that's air

[Verse 6: Elf Kid]
E to the L, I'm live on a set
From mic to the decks, they know that I rep
I ain't got time for phoning a sket
Hold up a deck, niggas out my ends
Will clap out all your friends and run from the feds

Till I had bars that were stuck in my head
Nah, they don't wanna chuck it again

Yo, let me tell you why
I'm the best MC you'll ever come by
Verse any bredda, murk any bredda
Jerk any bredda just to prove I'm right
Spray my ting like a nursery rhyme
MCs wanna be jerking lines
You best start learning yours, stop watching mine
Cause I'll rip man apart like it's surgery time

[Verse 8: Nico Lindsay]
Codename Lin, location in
No holstery, just deep within
Abstract like seethrough skin, with words, I swim
In a pool, they're peeking in

Want some grime respect? Then come and earn it
Swinging off bars like a curtain
I don't give a monkey's
Can't XP MC, I'm a whole new version
Whole new software, hold up, stop there
I hit your soft spot, turn a man soft there
Bros call me for beef, I'm like "What? Where?"
Stop by, all of the mandem are getting gwop there

[Verse 10: Ghostly]
See the way that man are moving?
That's top boy spitter in the game movements
That's man are creating a wave movements
That's I told you, this ain't a game movements
