[Intro: Kwam]
Alright, we've got some different flavour here
From mainland Europe
Out to Lorenzo on the switches
And if you ever forget
You can use this tune as a reminder that we do do this

[Bridge: Kwam]
Uh, while I'm alive
Better know we're gonna do this live
Do this calm
Better never try and tell me I can't
While I'm alive
Better know we're gonna do this alive
See, I do this Kwam
Better never try and tell me I can't

[Verse 1: Kwam]
No apologies
Come through, say what I like on the set
Lyrics that'll slap man right in the chest
That's when they clock they're right in a mess
You can have a one two tune getting airplay
But you don't sound too live in the flesh
You're a dibby MC, you better slide to the left
Don't try slide to the right with the best
Little punk, wanna start hype on the net
What about when you had mic on the set?
No big talk on the tunes or benders
Pipe down, you're not a goon, you're tender
You're a more deluded loon than Wenger
What? Saying you're fire, that's bollocks
I'll fan out the flame, leak on the embers
I'm in a class where you can't speak to the members

[Chorus: Kwam]
Bar for the bants
Flows in the bank
Live in the mix
Lyrical tricks
Look for the truth
Hooks in the booth
They're saying we're killing ourselves
Can you show a man proof? Please

[Verse 2: Kwam]
You don't have it
No beat around the bush, I can't have it
We're getting the levs to lift rapid
You're off the pace and it's tragic
I said, no apologies
Come through, say what I like on the set
Better lyrics that'll slap man right in the chest
That's when they clock they're right in a mess
You can have a one two tune getting airplay
But you don't sound too live in the flesh
You're a dibby MC, you better slide to the left
Don't try slide to the right with the best
Please, God, this ain't entry level
You wanna spit it? Best be levels
You're not levels, can't try meddle
Can't get a word in unless I settle

[Chorus: Kwam]
Bar for the bants
Flows in the bank
Live in the mix
Lyrical tricks
Look for the truth
Hooks in the booth
They're saying we're killing ourselves
Can you show a man proof? Please

[Chorus: Kwam]
Bar for the bants
Flows in the bank
Live in the mix
Lyrical tricks
Look for the truth
Hooks in the booth
They're saying we're killing ourselves
Can you show a man proof? Please

[Chorus: Kwam]
Bar for the bants
Flows in the bank
Live in the mix
Lyrical tricks
Look for the truth
Hooks in the booth
They're saying we're killing ourselves
Can you show a man proof? Please

[Verse 3: Kwam]
Know you're the best
Flows on the regs
Feel good when you're at the shows on the sets
Calm, big man won't wanna test
Right, they won't wanna test, no
They won't wanna speak or murmur
You think you're deep? I birthed ya
You're really meek, I'll learn ya
Going on like say it's peak when you turn up
One box'll leave your beak all churned up
Now you're there like "why did I reach?"
Run away far, go cry to your team

[Bridge: Kwam]
Uh, while I'm alive
Better know we're gonna do this live
Do this calm
Better never try and tell me I can't
While I'm alive
See, I do this Kwam
While I'm alive
See, I do this Kwam
