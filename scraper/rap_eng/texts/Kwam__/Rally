[Intro]
Seats, quickly, please
Any available seat, please
Kwam MC won the test
[?] to serve
Ready for play, seats quickly, please
Ready? Play

[Verse 1]
Rally on the tune like say I'm Del Potro
Big shots, stop an MC with a next honcho
I've bars involved, they weren't from Costco (not cheap)
Some man ah chat like say they've got a god flow
Heard two bars, thought to myself "not so"
Skipping on the track like say I've got hot soles
Tried moving the TEC but then you flopped though
Now your head's down, total drop though
Rally on the tune like say I'm Serena
Can't say that's a reach out, what'd you mean, bruv?
There's nobody on levs, have you seen her?
Nobody's anywhere near on the meter
I take dibby MCs for amoeba
Or tadpoles or a next little creature
(Small fry), if you've got a problem, speak up
I go really cold, in need of a heater

[Hook]
Rally on the tune like Novak and Andy
Rally on the tune like Roger and Raf
Rally on the tune like say a man's Berdych
Rally on the tune just like Stanislas
Rally on the tune like Novak and Andy
Rally on the tune like Roger and Raf
Rally on the tune like say a man's Berdych
Rally on the tune just like Stanislas

[Verse 2]
Walk in the place, scowl on my face like Harley
I ain't come here for a party
In this scene, I'm old school, I'm Atari
Don't give a shit who's holding a swammy
If you're not fully-grown, don't barge me
I'm a big man so a boy can't par me
Real talk, everybody thinks they're nasty
Till they get whacked up with their own car keys
One bang to your throat, now you sound raspy
Next bang to your mout, now you're all gaspy
Jump on the set, start blowing out raspberries
Come to the TEC, man's going on lardy
Going on lardy, going on heavy
Going on fat with the flow, straight like that
Don't chat to me, you ain't my mate like that
Tell a man buss out, you ain't my dad
I tell a fella you ain't my old man
If you wanna go clear, create your own plan
Old school so I tell a man don't ramp
I take down my voice for no gangs
It's a ting where I ain't scared to hold bangs
You're in deep trouble if I decide to throw back
That'll be a whole lot of stuff going on that you don't want
I suggest you don't lack

[Hook]
Rally on the tune like Novak and Andy
Rally on the tune like Roger and Raf
Rally on the tune like say a man's Berdych
Rally on the tune just like Stanislas
Rally on the tune like Novak and Andy
Rally on the tune like Roger and Raf
Rally on the tune like say a man's Berdych
Rally on the tune just like Stanislas

[Verse 3]
Back to back, you wanna backtrack
I'll have your prospects looking all matte black
Just in case you didn't catch that
In lamer terms, I mean far from bright
Can't be nice to be far from bright
We're different, kinda like dark and light
You're a little man, so you wanna bark and hype
Man wanna know why I laugh at guys
You wanna know why I laugh at guys?
Man ah man are trying way too hard, that's why
Now you wanna flex as if you are that guy
Can't get spun by the bars man right
Do you really think we think you're smart? That's lies
We can all see that you can't act right
All this chat about this thing and that thing
All this chat about watch when I catch him
Man love chatting up, dem man are ratchet
So much imaging, dem man attracting
No, we're not alike, don't say we're matching
Man said he's running it, I've already lapped him
Dem man are washed up, bring a new batch in
For the dibby MCs, I'm a captain
Dem man tell you they think I'm a headache
I tell dem boy dere go get an aspirin

[Hook]
Rally on the tune like Novak and Andy
Rally on the tune like Roger and Raf
Rally on the tune like say a man's Berdych
Rally on the tune just like Stanislas
Rally on the tune like Novak and Andy
Rally on the tune like Roger and Raf
Rally on the tune like say a man's Berdych
Rally on the tune just like Stanislas

[Outro]
Said I rally on the tune like Novak and Andy
Rally on the-
Man know anyway
Man know exactly what's going on when I touch the microphone
Leave it
Sending out to Trends every single, yeah?
Wotcha
