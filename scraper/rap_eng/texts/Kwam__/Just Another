[Intro]
Hold tight Moj
Bigging up the entire human race
All living organisms, in fact
I don't think we're all a million miles different, really
Hold tight everyone going through trials and tribulations
Everyone living good
I don't really know where my head's at still

[Verse 1]
Why do I take this?
Why are so many folks still racist?
I dunno where I'm going; will I make it?
How do I still find life so amazing?
If three men murder twelve people
Do those men represent a nation?
Wait, why are these things so blatant?
I smell the bullshit, it's not fragrant, wow
Why do we accept it?
Why are these people so unreceptive?
Are you safe in the place that you rest in?
If you say yes give thanks for your blessing
Why do we talk about free thought
If we get mad when somebody tests it?
Why do we hear somebody talk sense
And only take note of the clothes they're dressed in?
Well I guess that's the easy way
Best not to think, you get me, mate?
It's Black Friday, go on, fill up your plate
Get it all right now, why wait?
But it's moving fast, better not be late
Don't get left out, that's a nasty fate
Fuck them, I couldn't care less about FOMO
I ain't gonna give all my coin to your logo
Are you with me or should I go solo?
Socially speaking, what's the next low blow?
What you got for us next there Bo-Jo?
Will I ever be out of this dojo?
I want a place where the air's warm and nice
Hopes aren't high but of course I might
I feel like school never taught me right
I learnt lots there but it never taught me life

[Hook]
Just another bit of random music
Just another lot of random musings
I keep asking myself why I do this
I still find it faintly amusing
I walk so tall but I stay losing
I'm top draw but I've still gotta prove it
I'm not ticked off, same way I'm not moving
Guess the time's right - better stop cruising
Just another man who thinks he's someone
Just another one chasing a lump sum
No chance, it's about so much more
I'm used to it now, from day I been poor
But what's money, dough?
See, my mind's worth more than its weight in gold
Yeah, what's money, dough?
See, my mind's worth more than its weight in gold

[Verse 2]
Can't take man apart
I wanna rule the world like john part
Won't get a better MC in these parts
Can't try tell them I got no heart
Oi, what are you, cark? You little tart
You're trying to be too clever by half
I'm kicking up a stink like a red meat fart
Man's still here, gone too far
It's not a joke out here, not a lark
Black men are getting chopped down like bark
I want the best for myself and my dargs
Ain't got a clue why I still write bars
Maybe I think it'll buy me a yard
Maybe I think I'm making a mark
How misguided am I? What a par
Totally gassed till the end we are
When I say we, I mean the dreamers
We're still doing our bit to achieve
We're still doing our best to believe
No matter how bad it ever gets or seems so
When it all starts coming loose at the seams
Attach the needle, start the machine
Please don't tell me I can't have dreams
I'm gonna do my ting till I leave
I'm gonna do my ting till I go!
Do my ting to the death, right to the very last breath
Till I got no puff left
Not till then should you let me rest
Hold tight everyone, big up your chest
Remember, I told you - we are the best
You deserve the best, so don't take less
No enemy of progress shall transgress

[Outro]
Straight like that
Whatever happens
Keep putting one foot in front of the other
I'm telling myself that much more than you guys
If it helps you, take it and go forward
Say nothing
