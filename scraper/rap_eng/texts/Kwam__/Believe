[Verse 1]
Tomorrow ain't promised
Why wait for a next day to be on it?
Jump on your grind in whatever it may be
You don't wanna waste any time saying maybe
Tomorrow ain't given
Why wait for a next day to be driven?
You know you're too good to be hidden
So stop killing hours, you aren't in a prison
Tomorrow ain't granted
So don't look past it
You can use today to work out what the task is
It'll help when you're grafting
You're gonna meet doubting Toms on the way
Smile when they're laughing
It's all part of the path that you're crafting
Hear what a next man said when they asked him, he told them

[Chorus]
I ain't gonna be another hard luck story
You can't ignore me
And I could ask for a chance but I'd rather take it
I won't rep myself poorly
I ain't gonna be another should have been someone
It's about more than a lump sum
I wanna play a part in the present and future
And not get lost in the humdrum

[Verse 2]
And I didn't think of that chorus first
There's others who are far better versed
They'll tell you without work you'll be cursed
With a mediocrity you'll take to your hearse
Carried off without a mark on the earth
I'm not sure what could be worse, like
Ain't we all got a worth?
Living a life just to die when you're dead seems kinda perverse
I ain't gonna be a man who didn't quite get there
That's why you won't see me rest here
And yeah it's true that I've slowed to a walk
Truth is, that's only so we can talk
If my counterparts are the reds in the pack
Then I must be the brown in the baulk
Since I was young I've had that same thought
Lemme just say what I'm saying in short

[Chorus]
I ain't gonna be another hard luck story
You can't ignore me
And I could ask for a chance but I'd rather take it
I won't rep myself poorly
I ain't gonna be another should have been someone
It's about more than a lump sum
I wanna play a part in the present and future
And not get lost in the humdrum

[Verse 3]
If you're gonna be another hard luck story
You can go ahead and ignore me
After all, what do I know surely?
This could all be one big porkie
I could be trying to mislead you
I could well be doing a misdeed
On the other hand I could be giving out
Good solid advice, so take it, it's free
Come again, what's that? You're gonna be a didn't quite get there?
No sweat, grab a deckchair
I'll walk on in the rain and the cold
And come out of the other side shaking my wet hair
Now I've got no doubt I can rep here
I was in darkness, never saw death there
I got my best years coming up, how do I know that?
To the same statement I go back

[Chorus]
I ain't gonna be another hard luck story
You can't ignore me
And I could ask for a chance but I'd rather take it
I won't rep myself poorly
I ain't gonna be another should have been someone
It's about more than a lump sum
I wanna play a part in the present and future
And not get lost in the humdrum

[Verse 4]
Hail the creators of hard luck stories
Fuck the Tories
In the same breath, let me say fuck Labour
The lies they sold a nation were brazen
In sixth form they came and sold us a wheeze
At that time they'd already cheapened degrees
Now they wanna bill the cost to kids who are teens?
It's all obscene
I hear what they're saying, they must cut deep
But a scratch to the well off would make poor bleed
Man are making calls on things they've not seen
I may as well give hair tips to the Queen
Is that not dumb?
These times brown nose George ain't been to the slums
Yet he's allowed to call the residents scum?
Fuck that, I'm a start bursting my lungs yelling out

[Chorus]
I ain't gonna be another hard luck story
You can't ignore me
And I could ask for a chance but I'd rather take it
I won't rep myself poorly
I ain't gonna be another should have been someone
It's about more than a lump sum
I wanna play a part in the present and future
And not get lost in the humdrum
