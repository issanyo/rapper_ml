[Verse 1: Kwam]
This one's got man spazzing out fully
I'm a start take piss like a playground bully
I'll have the other kids getting all boomy
While I'm all having a laugh, they're like "how could he?"
Grab a next man and give a next man a noogie
When I'm done I dash man like the roach on a zoobie
They wanna know why I'm going on terrible
It's 'cos man are living too cushy
Couldn't care less if man think I'm pushy
Blood, the grime scene's in need of a shakedown
It's like I'm knee deep in a wasteground
I wanna flood your TVs with the great sound
Grime! That's what I've been on all this time, what
Give it up? Nah I'm okay, that's fine
Couple of aunts think I've lost my mind, still
I'll be dead before I lose my spine

[Hook: Kwam]
We got the strength of an ox on the tune
Take us out's what you're not gonna do
If I say we lose our headtops in the booth
You'll say "gas" but it's not, it's the truth
We got the strength of an ox on the tune
Take us out's what you're not gonna do
If I say we lose our headtops in the booth
You'll say "gas" but it's not, it's the truth

[Verse 2: Nico Lindsay]
What are they gonna do?
Claiming they're raping the tune
Is that a new joke? Listen, have a new flow
That one's dead, hit me up for the cro
On a serious note
In five years can you vision your goals?
The scene's full of doughnuts and fruit cakes, leave it alone
Maybe at home with your fan base
I'm around like a bad taste
Can't get rid of me, swear down, outrage
Try cut me out like an outtake
I'll take you out, put you back in your damn place
Lyrical nutter and surgeon general
Keep looking straight and you'll see us ahead of you, obvi
On a track we're a bit cocky
Noonies get wet and merked for a hobby!

[Hook: Kwam]
We got the strength of an ox on the tune
Take us out's what you're not gonna do
If I say we lose our headtops in the booth
You'll say "gas" but it's not, it's the truth
We got the strength of an ox on the tune
Take us out's what you're not gonna do
If I say we lose our headtops in the booth
You'll say "gas" but it's not, it's the truth

[Verse 3: Kwam & Nico Lindsay]
Nah take us out's what you're gonna do
Nico ain't your new squeeze, me neither
And if you think you're too deep, we're deeper
You'll get smacked up, I don't care who sees us
We've been about! Now we got a neat buzz
There ain't much about grime you can teach us
If you got something good we're all ears
If not, bang this one out your speakers
Who said you're hard? I ain't heard of you!
Sound all hype and gassed on the tune
Can't hear a word from you!
Noise no lyrics, they spit it, observe then move
I listen, start thinking they're burning food
I'll come around on a different tip
As I sink in quick! Listen, prick
You'll say "gas" but it's not, it's the truth

[Hook: Kwam]
We got the strength of an ox on the tune
Take us out's what you're not gonna do
If I say we lose our headtops in the booth
You'll say "gas" but it's not, it's the truth
We got the strength of an ox on the tune
Take us out's what you're not gonna do
If I say we lose our headtops in the booth

We got the strength of an ox on the tune
Take us out's what you're not gonna do
If I say we lose our headtops in the booth
You'll say "gas" but it's not, it's the truth

Yo, we got the strength of an ox on the tune...

I said, we got the strength of ox on the tune
Take us out's what you're not gonna do
If I say we lose our headtops in the booth and you don't believe?
More fool you!
