[Verse 1: Milli Major]
Yeah, and I didn't do a gunshot riddim
So rah, I'mma let the gunshot hit 'em
Somebody tell me this boy didn't
Just try indirect on a riddim
Didn't wanna do it, now they wanna try do it
Nah, they didn't wanna do it, now they wanna try do it
Nah, they didn't wanna do it, now they wanna try spitting
I just tell 'em it's the life I'm living

[Verse 2: Big H]
Shooting stars
Them MCs better write new bars
Better write like Nas
Major, hit 'em in the head with the vase
Big MC in the room
Kill an MC for a tune
Evening and afternoon
AK rifle, zing zing zoom

[Verse 3: Kwam]
It's me

Most underrated player in this ting
Forget the rest, are you listening?
Drop one, two bars then I pass the bar
No, never that, watch how I'm living
You would've thought the boy [?]

[Verse 5: Sharky Major]

So when I power shouting shoutout rat-a-tat-tat
B-boom, b-boom
Give me the riddim, I'll diss man on a tune

The fire that I've got might blaze 'em, drop and erase 'em
If I ain't rating a yout

[Verse 8: Typah]
Headtop, lick off his headtop
Man ain't ducking the legshot, mek a man know

One wrong move, I'll be letting it swing
Nah, you don't wanna get all your boys involved
So it's best man chill out all-out at the back cuh
Dem man are moist, they can't see a ting
Nah, they don't wanna see me wile out with the strap

[Verse 9: Dimples]
See, I don't hold back, thump up a beat
And it's bait like a strap tucked under the seat
Me ah make grime's dead, radio's live
On a Taliban ting, AKs in the sky
Dem man are basic, levels ain't raising
Now they wanna offer me change like I'm saving
They're raving lunatics, save it
Never seen his track on an iPod playlist

[Verse 10: Jammin]
They can't chat to the kid
No sparks, I bet you ain't no match for the kid
I'm on a big man ting, they're acting a kid
I'm the farrda, I will give slaps to a kid
They act bad when I put them on
Man, I made them shine like I gave my chaps to a kid
You just turned bad, I've been bad from a kid
School with the compass, jooked up a kid

[Verse 11: Rival]
I'm on a BlackBerry swipe
Jack berries, clamp berries, that berry's nice
Got a BlackBerry, berries getting buried
In rivz's pocket, I don't care, it's a hype
I'm on a BlackBerry swipe
Jack berries, clamp berries, that berry's nice
Got a BlackBerry, berries getting buried
In rivz's pocket, I don't care, it's a hype

[Verse 12: Tre Mission]
See me when I come through solo
Your girl wanna come through dolo
My gear when I come through polo
She like "oh yes", I'm like "oh no"
See me when I come through solo
Your girl wanna come through dolo
My gear when I come through polo
She like "oh yes", I'm like "oh no"
