Yeah
It's me again
Send out to Trends again
And this time, you better know
If you wanna come rally with the kings
You better have a right royal game to play with

[Verse 1]
Yeah, better have a good game
Come against this, better have a good day
If they can't perform, I send 'em a way
Like "thank you, come again, have a good day"
You're just one of them with a good face
You've got a nerve tryna get on my case
Everybody knows that I've got style and grace
I'm ahead more than a mile in pace
This time, now, it ain't even a race
It's only laughs and health that I chase
Anyone who intrude on my personal space
I'mma say this again, look at my face
I'm a grown up, there's no time to waste
Bin man don't receive time of day
Waste girls need to move right away
I'll tell you now, it's not that type of day

[Hook]
Yeah, better have a good game
If you wanna come and try rally on the set
True, I'm on a lev that you might not match
Bring it at a pace that you might not catch
Yep, yep, better have a good game
If you wanna come and try rally on the set
True, I'm on a lev that you might not match
Man are zapping at a pace that you might not catch

[Verse 2]
Yeah, practice makes perfect
Trust when I say reacting ain't worth it
Go on like say you're a match for eight persons
True say, you're not on act, you ain't certain
I hear the bars, they aren't coming easy
You can't run up on air and unsee me
Style and grace put a man away neatly
Chat bad but they're nice lads when they meet me
And you know what? That suits me
True say, I don't really wanna do beef
Don't involve me in any new grief
I don't wanna box out 2 2 teeth
I never came here for the arms
But a fist at 'em will free up the arms
You don't know me, I don't know who you are
So don't start putting your hands on my garms

[Hook]
Yeah, better have a good game
If you wanna come and try rally on the set
True, I'm on a lev that you might not match
Bring it at a pace that you might not catch
Yep, yep, better have a good game
If you wanna come and try rally on the set
True, I'm on a lev that you might not match
Man are zapping at a pace that you might not catch

[Verse 3]
Bruv, no apologies
Come through, say what I like on a set
Bare lyrics that will slap man right in the chest
That's when they clock they're right in a mess
You can have a 1-2 tune getting airplay
But you don't sound too live in the flesh
Dibby MCs better slide to the left
Don't try stand to the right with the best
Now you little fons wanna start hype on the net
What about when you had mic on the set?
No big talk on the tunes or blenders
Pipe down, you're not a goon, you're tender
You're a more deluded loon than Wenger
What? Saying you're fire, that's bollocks
I'll fan out the flame, leak on the embers
I'm in a class where you can't speak to the members
I said no apologies
Come through, say what I like on a set
Bare lyrics that will slap man right in the chest
That's when they clock they're right in a mess
You can have a 1-2 tune getting airplay
But you don't sound too live in the flesh
You dibby MC, you better slide to the left
Don't try stand to the right with the best
Little fons wanna start hype on the net
What about when you had mic on the set?
No big talk on the tunes or blenders
Pipe down, you're not a goon, you're tender
You're a more deluded loon than Wenger
What? Saying you're fire, that's bollocks
I'll fan out the flame and then leak on the embers
I'm in a class where you can't speak to the members

[Hook]
Yeah, better have a good game
If you wanna come and try rally on the set
True, I'm on a lev that you might not match
Bring it at a pace that you might not catch
Yep, yep, better have a good game
If you wanna come and try rally on the set
True, I'm on a lev that you might not match
Man are zapping at a pace that you might not catch
