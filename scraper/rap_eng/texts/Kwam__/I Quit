[Verse 1]
And I'm only on a part-time contract
But it's like I'm in a constant combat
For the rest of my free moments
"No overtime please!" I was quite cogent
Never left anyone in doubt when I told 'em..
I guess nobody cared
Or it went in the first then out the other ear..
To cut a long story short, that's why I'm 'ere
Today I'm on a 10 till 10
This lot have given me jip* since the get-go
And I've gotta put up with them till then
Five hours left and I'm already spent
But if I take off then I can't pay rent
Not worth making a fuss to be fair
Gimme one minute, I gotta refill the pens
Yeah, I know nowadays, a job's a job
But these employers have all lost the plot
Man are saying "make work pay" but it's not
I don't think anybody's asking a lot
Me now I don't need more money
But in light of the fact I'm not a dummy
I do hope mine will stop going on funny
That's why I get vexed
These pricks never wanna stick to the text
I know they want us all to have flex
But they got me in a mix like say I'm on decks
Coming in work like "rah what's next?
Robbing the poor again? Yeah, I bet!"
And I shouldn't feel bad I guess
It's not my hand pushing them into debt

[Hook]
You know what? That's it
I've had it up to here with this shit
Can't take all the treachery, it properly gets to me
I may as well work with the CIDs
These products are harmful
Without the proper instruction and guidance
Instead Coral, Paddy and the rest
Show a million deals to the public and blind 'em
You know what? That's it
I've had it up to here so I quit
Can't take all the treachery, it properly gets to me
I may as well work with the CIDs
These products are harmful
Without the proper instruction and guidance
Instead Coral, Paddy and the rest
Show a million deals to the public and blind 'em

[Verse 2]
Quit my job... yeah, right
I was back in the very next night
Blame it on Errol he got me too hype
My pockets are way too light
Anyway it's normally quiet of an evening
There aren't any more UK meetings
No stress, long as we don't get any chiefs in
One sec, how much on the machine?
You want 600 on the machine?
But you only just now did 450
You could say the man's quite keen
Or you could say somebody sold him a dream
Those machines are way worse than they seem
You can do a few bags in alarming speed
I'm only gonna say the following once
I could keep quiet but I think that's mean
Don't put money in the machines to try and make money
The companies use machines to make money
Odds and payouts are all controlled
They end up getting in sacks full of dough
Is it all random? I'm telling you no
I've got a financial figure sheet in my home..
Which clearly shows
How low this lot have sunk with the con
I can't be part of these lies it's wrong
I can't be part of this crime, I'm gone
My morals are way too strong
To accept the stench of the pong
I never said I'd be 'ere for ten years but
Even another day in this job's long
While I'm 'ere there's not a thing to be proud of
Selling people stuff they don't really want

[Hook]
You know what? That's it
