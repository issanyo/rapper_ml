OK
So, remember on the previous track
I was saying how I'm not sure where my head's at?
This track's kind of an extension of that thought
Bigging up Shy One, thank you
Thank you very, very much
Hold tight all the crew, yeah?
If you can relate to this, enjoy
Check me

[Verse 1]
Look I don't want much
If I'm being honest I already had a touch in life
My parents are still husband and wife
I've already done so much in my time
Mum says that's not enough I gotta shine
Mumma, take time, I'm still reaching my prime
I don't wanna get too deep with the rhymes
Let me keep still on the seat of this bike
Cause I don't wanna get bum sores
I can't control what's gonna happen, it'll run course
Told man you can't fully trust in a plan
All you can do is do all that you can
So I'm stood here thinking aloud
Cause I get days when I don't know who I am
Start to beat myself up then I remind myself it's normal
And I'm only a man

[Hook]
Stood here thinking aloud
What am I here to do? What's this about?
Do I wanna get money? If so, what amount?
Do I want so much that I can't count?
Here trying to work out just what I need
I think truth be told, I just wanna be
Not sure what I want or what I need
Truth be told, I've just gotta be

[Verse 2]
Women in my life don't get this
They think I don't care cause I don't sweat shit
Like say I can't see where Wretch is
I do my ting, they don't have to respect it
What's more, they don't have to believe me
I trust myself, I ain't gonna get weepy
You don't trust me it's all good, leave me
I'ma work hard till I get sleepy
Going so hard when they can't see me
Might be the reason they reckon I'm dreamy
This ain't a game and I ain't no genie
I can only do my best in the present
Treat the future like it's a present
True, I don't really know what I'm getting
Best case, I can have a faint idea
I can only try to make mine here

[Hook]
Stood here thinking aloud
What am I here to do? What's this about?
Do I wanna get money? If so, what amount?
Do I want so much that I can't count?
Here trying to work out just what I need
I think truth be told, I just wanna be
Not sure what I want or what I need
Truth be told, I've just gotta be

[Verse 3]
If not being sure is a crime, I'm guilty
I'm an animal, I'm filthy
But I don't think that it's all that deep
Don't see why you wanna call that weak
I'm just being honest, so fall back, please
Never did say I don't wanna make Ps
Man know I don't wanna drop back to my knees
I just don't wanna be part of any sleaze
If not being sure is a crime, then jail me
Chuck away the key, don't bail me
No sweat, don't check for me, don't mail me
You're best to steer clear for your own safety
Sounds mad, but it's how I feel lately
Being unsure's nothing like being lazy
Saying that, maybe it is and I'm wrong
Same way again if it isn't I'm not

[Hook]
Stood here thinking aloud
What am I here to do? What's this about?
Do I wanna get money? If so, what amount?
Do I want so much that I can't count?
Here trying to work out just what I need
I think truth be told, I just wanna be
Not sure what I want or what I need
Truth be told, I've just gotta be

[Hook]
Stood here thinking aloud
What am I here to do? What's this about?
Do I wanna get money? If so, what amount?
Do I want so much that I can't count?
Here trying to work out just what I need
I think truth be told, I just wanna be
Not sure what I want or what I need
Truth be told, I've just gotta be

[Outro]
Just a little bit of food for thought
Just in case you were feeling peckish
Yes
