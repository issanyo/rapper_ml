[Verse 1]
There's a war going on
Intellectual fire and brimstone
All the focus on money and skin tone
Misdirections I think so, it's known
I ain't the first or last that'll say this
But while we keep battling about who's
Light skin or dark skin time is 'a wasting
I've had it up to here, now I'm impatient
One man can never outsize a nation
Or hold a conversation
In short what I'm saying here is bun separation
The many are stronger than the one and it's blatant
Don't care whether man are Dutch or Haitian
If she's an African or Australasian
Look at the person you're next to
You're a human, they're a human, that's the relation
There's a war going on
There's a war going on
Please don't think it's all a dance and a song
When I look around, I find the evidence strong
Common sense on the road seems to be gone
Everyone's out for themselves, am I wrong?
Wouldn't be a problem if we had balance
Sad thing nowadays is that we haven't
Fuck the American dream, it's a nightmare
Now I see government bringing it right here
Our social framework was a world leader
Now man are pushing the disconnect deeper
You can hear all this and think I'm a preacher
That means your mind's caught fast in a sleeper
Get your brain out of the tight snare
We've gotta force the system to fight fair

[Verse 2]
No bare knuckles
No putting the poor in more trouble
Most important above all
No person is important above all
Let's adore and endure each other
You can't be the best yourself, you need others
Let's adore and endure each other
I don't want enemies, me I need brothers
I don't want enemies, me I need sisters
No way can I do me against system
From a lone stance, the goal looks distant
I'm gonna need some assistance
We can break down doors if we stay persistent
No long ting I'm insistent
If enough people scream enough man can't miss 'em
At that point they'll have to listen
Then we've gotta ensure what's heard is turned to some action
That's called giving the movement more traction
Not just a pic in the paper with a caption
I'm talking actual tangible change like
Forcing the likes of Starbucks to pay
Not coming here for our bucks to take
Like building actual housing estates
Not cardboard flats that are easy to raze
I wanna see us come out of this phase
We're being taught to move in selfish ways
Sometimes when I say hi to a neighbour
I will get an odd look like I'm a stranger
I'm like what's going on these days?
Are we still fretting about a man's race?
Certain times I wanna scream out "wait!
Stop the world, I'm getting off now, straight!"

[Verse 3]
There's a war going on
Intellectual fire and brimstone

Light skin or dark skin time is 'a wasting
