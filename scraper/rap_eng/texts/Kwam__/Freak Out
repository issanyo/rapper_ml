[Intro]
OK
OK, the first thing is to say big up Trends
Because this one is unbelievably good, thank you
Next thing to say
I know there's been a lot of mental things going on
In the media, of late
But I think we should all just try and remain calm because
I think we're all gonna be OK, ultimately
Hopefully

[Verse 1]
Got flows to make the people dance
Live on the set with a regal stance
But it's futile, it's all a feeble farce
You think the future's bright; the sequel's dark
We never kept evil far
Now we see it everywhere that we are
Near the brink, it's clear that we are
The men in charge don't care who you are
They're on the TV dressed in their garb
More time these man are killers at large
We're not safe, we're all collateral darg
Like say you can't get shot by a narc
Ask Azelle, go ask Smiley as well
I wonder if those names ring a bell
Who's next up? Only time's gonna tell
I just hope I'm not the next to be felled

[Verse 2]
Everybody, freak out just go nuts
Whether you are children or grown ups
Are you not aware that we're so fucked?
There is no avoiding we're gonna die
The media said so and they never lie
So I'm giving up now, it's like why try?
Fuck being shook, man's gonna live life
I'm gonna live right, never gonna think twice
Fuck politics, I'm gonna do peace
I'm gonna do me, lighting a doobie
What's the solution? Ain't got a Scooby
I'm just one of these brers from the past
Who ain't got the answer, oh well sue me
I won't let the press turn me loopy
If you trust them you must believe your life's a movie
And these are scary times!

[Verse 3]
Dark days are ahead
Will you come out your yard or hide in your bed?
I'm not afraid, I will show my head
I'm not a wasteman, I know my levs
Towards the sky's how I hold my neck
Walking proud with the rest of the plebs
We shall overcome, no more or less
There will be bloodshed, pain and stress
But as long as our kids live better that's bless
It'll be good to clear this mess
Let's help to ease their duress
I will laugh in your face when you claim I jest
This ain't a joke, it's happening now
And that's the point I'm hammering down
Don't believe me now, but I won't hold that against you
When you start clamouring round
