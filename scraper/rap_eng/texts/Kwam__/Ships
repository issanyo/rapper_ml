[Verse 1: Kwam]
Listen, I don't get you
I wanna get you, am I gonna get to?
You don't get me
I wanna tell you every time you let me
Guess I'm not clear enough
Or you're not clear enough
It's looking like we're not hearing us
Points of view that aren't near enough
I don't wanna do this, but I've gotta do this
Said I want you, I've gotta prove it
Tell me how do you tick? Sorry, I was cruising
I was on the job snoozing
You don't wanna kiss me, let me know your history
I get why you wanna diss me
Cause I get flimsy, and I was being ditsy
And I only did what fit me

[Chorus: Kwam]
We speak the same language
Where's our understanding?
We speak the same language
I don't understand this
We speak the same language
Where's our understanding?
I don't understand this

[Verse 2: Kwam]
You and I are just drifting apart
You and I are like ships in the dark
You think I'm not fit for the task
You think I wanna stick to my path
You and I are just drifting apart
You and I are like ships in the dark
You think I'm not fit for the task
You think I wanna stick to my path
We're drifting apart
Like ships in the dark
Or boats in the night
Look, I don't wanna fight
I wanna keep hold of the prize
But I can't if it won't be alright
Do you think you can show me a sign?
Come close to me, show you my eyes

[Chorus: Kwam]
We speak the same language
Where's our understanding?
We speak the same language
I don't understand this
We speak the same language
Where's our understanding?
We speak the same language
(I don't understand this)

[Verse 3: Kwam]
You wanna see me show that I'm keen
I was here thinking "I know what you mean"
Now you're there thinking "I don't wanna meet"
Cause I said a one little show's on the Beeb
And I'll watch it later
Now you wanna tell me "don't be a faker"
How you gonna tell me I'm an imitator?
Why on earth are you saying that's a major?
It's a minor, you're twisting my mind up
Fluffy little bits in the grinder
Honey, let me in for a night cuh
Do you think we can find us?
Or can we get a little tighter?
Look, I don't wanna fight ya, you know that I like ya
I'd pipe up but I doubt light's enough
I even doubt my love's quite enough

[Chorus: Kwam]
We speak the same language
Where's our understanding?
We speak the same language
I don't understand this
We speak the same language
Where's our understanding?
We speak the same language
(I don't understand this)
