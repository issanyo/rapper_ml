[Chorus]
Hot boy, I'm a hot boy
Girls look twice when they see this boy
I'm a hot boy, I'm a hot boy
Look at my height, I must be a big boy
Hot boy, I'm a hot boy
Girls look twice when they see this boy
I'm a hot boy, I'm a hot boy
Look at my arms, I must be a big boy

[Verse 1]
Girl, let me take you to a next zone
Look at these arms, so long, so toned
Neither of us two should be alone
You know what girl, pass me your phone
Drop me a one text when you get home
I wanna speak to you when I'm indoors
I'm handsome, I really ought to be yours
Not perfect but I embrace these flaws
I'm a guy that'll start opening doors
Ladies see me round town and pause
It's a whole next ting when I'm in shorts
I'm feeling like Odin, but I ain't norse
I'm a big boy but I'm no horse
I rate myself but I'm not lost in the sauce
Babes, it's bait you rate man slyly
Come and get lost in my aura's force

[Chorus]
Hot boy, I'm a hot boy
Girls look twice when they see this boy
I'm a hot boy, I'm a hot boy
Look at my height, I must be a big boy
Hot boy, I'm a hot boy
Girls look twice when they see this boy
I'm a hot boy, I'm a hot boy
Look at my arms, I must be a big boy

[Verse 2]
Girl, let me take you to a next place
Look at this skin colour, look at this face
See, me, I'm so proud of my race
Babes, I'm hot chocolate, come get a taste
Have a one sip, you'll be amazed
Look at that smile all over your chevy
Wait till you see my belly
You're gonna think I'm a guy from telly
But it's not that, B, I'm not Reggie
I'm just a guy that knows he's heavy
Shea butter rubbed in, now I feel ready
My skin tone's ugly? Not on your nelly
F that, I look much better than Nelly
Black soap washes, I've had so many
Can't compare me to a next fella
It's like you're comparing a pound to a penny

[Chorus]
Hot boy, I'm a hot boy
Girls look twice when they see this boy
I'm a hot boy, I'm a hot boy
Look at my height, I must be a big boy
Hot boy, I'm a hot boy
Girls look twice when they see this boy
I'm a hot boy, I'm a hot boy
Look at my arms, I must be a big boy

[Verse 3]
Walk on the tube, lean on a pole like I own it
Can't tell me about zoning
Ladies look at me thinking of boning
All 'cause I got superior toning
Be assured, I'd have you moaning
If you ever laid in my bed where my home is
I'll give you all you can cope with
You'll be all haps when you're telling your homies
I think I'm a sexual master
Some girls think I'm a bastard
If you know one of them you can ask her
What I'm like then wait for the answer
I think I'm a great catch
Out to the girls that I once knew way back
Big shout to the women who could take that
The ones that wouldn't just lay back

[Chorus]
Hot boy, I'm a hot boy
Girls look twice when they see this boy
I'm a hot boy, I'm a hot boy
Look at my height, I must be a big boy
Hot boy, I'm a hot boy
Girls look twice when they see this boy
I'm a hot boy, I'm a hot boy
Look at my arms, I must be a big boy
