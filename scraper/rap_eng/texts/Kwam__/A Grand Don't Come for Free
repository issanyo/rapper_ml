So many people are scared of a graft
What d'you mean you don't wanna work hard?
How are you meant to have it all? Have a laugh
It's about time I took you to task
Can't be a boss if you ain't in charge
Can't be in charge if you don't wanna grind
Summink for nuffink? You're out of your mind
That might be your view, it's sure not mine
Next man are screaming they wanna take over
Ain't got a clue that they gotta take time
Hit a little problem and jump on Twitter
Not trying to solve it they just wanna whine
Carry on sending out tweets online
That's not gonna do shit for your spine
Watch when the whole world leaves you behind
I say that 'coz I'm being cruel to be kind
Can't see that well I'm sorry you're blind
Or you don't wanna open your eyes
You won't succeed if you don't wanna try
None of those words are a lie
Can't sit down if you wanna climb high!
If you're on the same time join the ascent
No way do I wanna be 'ere and then die
If you ask me that's a waste of a life
A waste of a cycle we don't get twice
See a lot of people with chip on their shoulder
And palm stretched out and I know just why
They've had the will squeezed out of their lives
Messages contradict all the time
Telling us to be one of a million odd guys
A structure in place to reduce our drive
Never get sucked in while you're alive!

These kids want the world without lifting a digit
They see hard work and they fidget
A grand don't come for free so get with it
A grand don't come for free so get with it
These kids want the world without lifting a digit
They see hard work and they fidget
A grand don't come for free so get with it
A grand don't come for free so get with it
Man want it all but they don't wanna stretch their limits
Too wrapped up in their gimmicks
A grand don't come for free so get with it
A grand don't come for free so get with it
If your head's screwed on you don't wanna waste time chilling
You could well end up finished
A grand don't come for free so get with it
A grand don't come for free so get with it

These kids want the world without starting a journey
They wanna reap rewards early
Mention work, their faces turn surly
Like they're saying "serve me, I'm a ledge"
So I'm thinking rah, what kind of ledge?
What, self-appointed? That's kinda dead
Your head needs rest, go find your bed
Believe me you were not born worthy
I saw Respect on the road, I asked her
"How do I get you?" She replied "Earn me
You're on the right path, it'll get curvy
Any time it does, keep your belief sturdy."
I said "Is that so?" A next voice said "Yes!"
Turned round trying to see who to address
She saw my face and said "Don't be alarmed
You don't know me yet; I'm Success
We see how you're going through Strain and Stress
Like Bereavement, they're awful places
We wanted to show you our faces
And remind you keep on chasing"
Respect spoke again, she said
"Believe me, when you get where you're going it's amazing
Keep focused till you arrive, when you're there
You'll have all the time for any gazing!"
So if you don't really wanna stretch your limits
You stay in that trap you made
I don't wanna follow suit, that's too waste
If you want a bit of that, that's you slain
Think you're the one to impress with a few minutes' work?
Get out of here, that's Usain!
Your first step can't be in the fast lane
If you hear what I'm saying let's scream it again

These kids want the world without lifting a digit
They see hard work and they fidget
A grand don't come for free so get with it
A grand don't come for free so get with it
These kids want the world without lifting a digit
They see hard work and they fidget
A grand don't come for free so get with it
A grand don't come for free so get with it
Man want it all but they don't wanna stretch their limits
Too wrapped up in their gimmicks
A grand don't come for free so get with it
A grand don't come for free so get with it
If your head's screwed on you don't wanna waste time chilling
You could well end up finished
A grand don't come for free so get with it
A grand don't come for free so get with it
