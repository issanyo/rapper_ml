[Chorus: Rival]
Man ah lock off the rave
When I'm back with the remix, I lock off the rave
Eight bars drop, MCs watch
That's why you can't push your luck in the rave
Look, man ah lock off the rave
When I'm back with the remix, I lock off the rave
Eight bars drop, MCs watch
That's why you can't push your luck in the rave
Rave, man ah lock off the dance
When the eight-bar drops, man ah lock off the dance
Eight bars drop, MCs watch
That's why you can't push your luck in the dance
Look, man ah lock off the dance
When the eight-bar drops, man ah lock off the dance
Eight bars drop, MCs watch
That's why you can't push your luck in the dance

[Verse 1: Rival]
You know dem ways dere
Where it's hard-hitting sound that will blast up your town
Nah, man, I ain't not calming it down
One for your speakers
Lock off the rave with the remix, Jesus
Yeah, still hit 'em in a next place
Watch, let me set pace (shotty)
Remove his head from his neck, mate
Back with some bruddas that'll end raves, dun know

[Verse 2: Discarda]
I rhyme on, rhyme on
So I keep on rhyming
They try put me down, I keep on smiling
Try knock me down, I keep on climbing
The rave will get lock off
It's thirty-six ounces, minimum drop-off
I keep on grinding
Back off, I keep on wiling

[Verse 3: Jammin]
Cannon, watch how I lock off the rave (hey)
Done any place, any dance (hey)
Lightest day, I get dark (hey)
Leave 'em like "oh my god"
When I step in the room, the dance is dead (hey)
Watch how I reverse the vibe
The crowd get hype when I get the mic
Cuh man ah get dark like reverse the light

[Verse 4: Nasty Jack]
Quick time, lock off the rave, early
I'll do a Bossman big birdie
On all you wannabe grims, Shirleys
Bun with the stainless stick, dirty
Fire much more than a hot sixteen
When I come in, I let off the whole magazine, early
Nasty flipping them keys, turning
Not like me, I'm on fire, burning

[Verse 5: Kozzie]
I'll fight my formula
It's a fresh one, watch me go in
From early, I've been on this Ustream ting
What does that mean? I'm a Ustream king
Back again, smart and got the fans locked in
Grime generation, I run the thing
Course I'll get Rival, Marger and Merky
Won't see me give out my BB pin

[Verse 6: Badness]
Ok, duppy and leave, duppy and leave
Badness come and duppy and
Duppy and leave, ehhh
The rave, Badness come and duppy and
Duppy and, duppy and leave, duppy and leave
Badness come and duppy and
Duppy and leave, ehhh
Badness come and lock off the rave

[Verse 7: Merky ACE]
Call for your back up, you will get smack up
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight
Nine, ten headshots, points get rack up
You're on a beef ting, but I'm tryna get my stack up
Roll to the rave, spit two bars
Then I get paid
I dare any eediat boy get brave, to Merky ACE
I'll start a stampede and lock off the rave

[Verse 8: Sharky Major]
Look, I will take 'em out, blaze 'em now
With bars that'll break 'em down, the rave's crown
On a swift ting, with no thinking, Major's a kingpin
Lock off the rave in an instant
It's no big ting
What I devise when I write can make wigs spin
Farda to a scene I can see a whole load of my kids in
But still lock off the rave, quick ting

[Verse 9: Danny D]
Out for the treasure, island
Try move to man, backfiring
I'll have you hanging up your booth retiring
We're unidentified flying
It goes boom, bang, why they trying?
About headshot bars
Them man are weak, some Deadshot bars

[Verse 10: Kwam & (Big Narstie)]
Yeah, I got flows to shut the dance down
No, you are not cold, so take your arse out
Of the building, up the road to your gaff please
Firm up before you come tryna chat greaze
Me, I'm on a mad one, somebody slap me
Hold tight Avalanche, MC family
Most shower MC giving it gladly (ouch!)
Come off of it, you ain't actually bad breed

[Verse 11: Big Narstie]
Man better know, blud, man better know, blud
Man better know I'm gassed
Man better know, blud, man better know, blud
Man better know I'm gassed
On a next ting, on a next ting
On a next ting, on a next ting
Gas

[Verse 12: Blacks]
Yeah, oh Jesus
Watch the way that I lock off the rave
These man do it and don't get paid
Promoters all wanna give me champagne
Them man are lucky if they get a Fanta
I'm Blacks, aka banter
These yutes are just gassed off the camera
Me, I'll lock off the rave, I'm gangster

[Verse 13: Dark Boi]
Scatter
Man get hit with the dagger
Run, run, I'm the attacker
Think you're bad? Draw for your clapper
Cuh, straight gangster
He'll get b-b-brapped up
Dark Boi ain't no lacker
Still moving into the next chapter

[Verse 14: Ego]
Shot them from all angles, lock off the rave
Please don't think man ah just spit bars
I will roll to your dance
Lick down anyone tryna look hard
I ain't tryna put on no bad boy stance
Jump in the middle, get dropped
I ain't tryna prolong any arms
Man wanna come here, hyping to me and my dargs
Like say I won't done their dance

[Verse 15: Diesle]
I'll lock off the rave, lock off the dance
Anybody acting rough when I come through
Buss off a hundred percent from France
Dose up a guy, leave guys in a trance
Either that or my bars stay loads
Straps and weed, that's a reload
Them likkle pussy over there can't lock off the rave
'Cause them little pricks can't get a reload

[Verse 16: Jammer]
It's a champagne campaign when I come through with the P
Buy out the bar, that's me
Celebrate that with champs and weed
Ten green bottles on the wall for the team
And Boy Better Know, it's a team, so shut off
And none of my crew don't call for police
All my dargs dem roll with the Ps
Aim for the target, buss, then breeze

[Verse 17: Jamakabi]
Yo, the dance get lock off
Any disrespect, your head get tek off
Don't wanna see the big ting start let off
Watch how I lock off the rave and hum off
Eight bar murder-ation ah go pop off
Come through, duppy the dance and then fuck off
Show respect, man ah vet, no knock-off
How you mean, the rave get lock off

[Chorus: Rival]
Man ah lock off the rave
When I'm back with the remix, I lock off the rave
Eight bars dropped, MCs watch
That's why you can't push your luck in the rave
Look, man ah lock off the rave
When I'm back with the remix, I lock off the rave
Eight bars dropped, MCs watch
That's why you can't push your luck in the rave

[Outro: Rival]
Yes, headshot season
Dun know, Lock Off The Rave Remix
Shout out all the MCs
Darq E Freaker, madness
