[Verse 1]
Yo! Who's me?
You're over late, I'm Kwam MC
Big black brudda with the bars and cheek
The one that don't live for stars and P
Man hear my flows, there's bare rahs and screams
Now them man are like "Nah, restart that please"
I never ever say too much I'm a tease
Yeah I keep my shit tight like Vs
And I don't rate many other MCs
Look at them same way I look at McD's
I ain't got time for these
These little twats don't come to my knees
Tell a man don't lemme call time on your lease
Before you get dumped out on the streets
Don't you know that I'm the MUP?
Blood, you're pissed if you and I meet, you and I meet

[Hook]
It's me
Forget the N-U-T
Address me as the MUP
I don't wanna hear anybody say who's he
What d'you mean? It's me
Forget the N-U-T
Address me as the MUP
I don't wanna hear anybody say who's he! Who's he?
It's me (me)
Forget the N-U-T (T)
Address me as the MUP
I don't wanna hear anybody say who's he
What d'you mean? It's me! (me)
Forget the N-U-T (T)
Address me as the MUP
I don't wanna hear anybody say who's he

[Verse 2]
"Reh keh keh, blah blah blah
You're saying you're Kwam, I don't know who you are"
I've had them kinda pars
But it's never stopped man doing it large
Watch it all change when I make my mark
I'll probably have man trying to eat my farts
Acting hysterical like young tarts
Getting all gassed up when I come past
It won't make me happs though, I got class
Truth be told I got a much bigger task and at
These times I ain't even done half
Gotta keep my eyes fixed on my path
When I do land I'll blow the Richter apart
Make man a man look shit for a laugh
All in a day's work none of it's hard
Who told a man I'd be scared of a bark?

[Hook]
It's me
Forget the N-U-T
Address me as the MUP
I don't wanna hear anybody say who's he
What d'you mean? It's me
Forget the N-U-T
Address me as the MUP
I don't wanna hear anybody say who's he! Who's he?
It's me (me)
Forget the N-U-T (T)
Address me as the MUP
I don't wanna hear anybody say who's he
What d'you mean? It's me! (me)
Forget the N-U-T (T)
Address me as the MUP
I don't wanna hear anybody say who's he

[Verse 3]
Might see me
With a weird face on my white tee
Got lined up by the ArdWear team
Man done a good job, it was well worth the P
Might see me, IC3
Letting off bars with the Alien team
Won't hear anybody here say "reem"
Us lot are men, leave that for the teens
Us lot are men, leave that for the neeks
Don't bring that around MUPs
Hold a box, it might send you sleep
Your flows are washed, it don't let loose heat
Real talk your mates are gonna get you beat
Can't eat with us, we never set you seats
Still man say they don't know about me
I gotta educate the next who speaks on who I be

[Hook]
It's me
Forget the N-U-T
Address me as the MUP
I don't wanna hear anybody say who's he
What d'you mean? It's me
Forget the N-U-T
Address me as the MUP
I don't wanna hear anybody say who's he! Who's he?
It's me (me)
Forget the N-U-T (T)
Address me as the MUP
I don't wanna hear anybody say who's he
What d'you mean? It's me! (me)
Forget the N-U-T (T)
Address me as the MUP
I don't wanna hear anybody say who's he
