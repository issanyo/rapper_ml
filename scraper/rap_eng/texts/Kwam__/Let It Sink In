[Intro]
Alright, yes, OK
Things might be going too fast or too rubbish or whatever
But I'm gonna need you to just relax
Take a deep breath
And let it sink in

[Hook]
Let it sink in
Through to your skin
Into your pores
That's it, relax and pause
Fret no more
Do no chores
This time's yours
So let it sink in

[Verse 1]
Feel stressed? You're not alone
Let it all out, have a good moan
You don't want all that in your dome
Take two minutes, let it all go
It's quite normal to get a bit low
But don't stay down there, it's not a good zone
You got annoyed by a berk at work?
Don't still be annoyed at home
Feel stressed? Time for a break
Don't sweat how much time it'll take
Show love to your brain
Take good care of your mental state
Defeat that hate
Release that hate
Delete that straight
You don't need that wave

[Hook]
Let it sink in
Through to your skin
Into your pores
That's it, relax and pause
Fret no more
Do no chores
This time's yours
So let it sink in

[Verse 2]
Is your head still pounding?
Do you feel you're drowning?
The bad vibes are crowding
Don't worry, though, just start shouting
Now, is your head still hurting?
Do you feel that working?
Now, I can't be certain
But I think it's worth it
Well worth letting your emotions flow
Well worth letting your frustration go
It's not easy, I know
Please, just go with the flow
Ride with the highs and the lows
You were down on the ground, then you rose
Now you feel better from your head to your toes
And that there's how a good vibe grows

[Hook]
Let it sink in
Through to your skin
Into your pores
That's it, relax and pause
Fret no more
Do no chores
This time's yours
So let it sink in

[Verse 3]
We are the best
Say that again, we're the best
We can handle the stress
We can pass any test
We are the greatest
Say that again, we're the greatest
We're alive, so we're amazing
We all deserve some enormous ratings
Push out your chest and breathe
Release your anger, it's not that deep
Push out your chest and calm
Release your anger, it's doing you harm
Send it away
Get ready for a brand new day
Put this one away
Go again when you see those rays

[Hook]
Let it sink in
Through to your skin
Into your pores
That's it, relax and pause
Fret no more
Do no chores
This time's yours
So let it sink in

[Outro]
Hope you enjoyed listening
Not just to this track, but all of 'em
And remember, it's not a bad thing to say you don't know
It's OK to say you don't know
