The year's 2011
Where the masses clean up the mess that a small few made
And MPs remain all too fake
Shutting amenities left right middle
A strange response to an old riddle
Spit on a man's big society, see all of that?
Big boy ginals
Taking the mick, more than a little
Libraries shut but not enough of us care
It's amazing
It's like man don't know books are amazing
Watching our public services cave in
It was bound to be this when Cameron and his lot came in
Lining their private sector mates up
With the big contracts
And calling it saving

Oh 11 where toddlers play shoot 'em ups
And man wanna ask why youts are fucked
In a few years' time I'm due to cut
I ain't bringing up kids here
Boys opening up heads like lids here
No I don't believe my mindset fits here
Burying a child's every parent's big fear
I just thank God that stray shell missed
If not I would have been down one sis
Man think it's a video game inna dis
But this is real life not a level
A human's worth much more than the price of a bezel
Breitling, Roley, Jacobs, whatever one
I don't care if the strap's a pure leather one
And if you believe any different
I believe you must be stood to the right of the devil

The year's 2011
Trust for your fellow man is a myth now
We're squashed together in a big town so it's no shock
We all know the cost if you ever doze off
Big thanks to the press
You do a great job raising our stress
If I believed everything I heard from them
I'd kill myself thinking the world was a mess
Two zero one one
Where your hard-earned money gets less
People are existing under duress
Next people top themselves over their debts
How can you blame 'em?
With the amount of calls they get daily laden with threats
Not to mention all the texts, I've been there
They make you feel as if say you've sinned bare

It's oh 11, and nobody cares
A man lays hands on his queen in the street
Everybody acts like nobody hears
Somebody help, what is nobody there?
I was on a bus when I saw it occur
Mum's life nobody there said a word
I'll tell you why no one intervened
They're clearly all scared of the things they've heard
It comes like we've lost our nerve
A bag of eyes were just fixed to the kerb
That's when I clocked it's all for ourselves out here
And it wasn't a nice thing to learn
A society of selfish sods
I swear it makes my gut churn
And no these aren't just good words in a verse
Please be aware that it really does turn

The year's 2011
And we ain't got no respect for the old
I'll tell you now there'll never be a day
Where Mum or Dad just get left in a home
If they shit themselves, I'll clean that
I ain't having either of them getting screamed at
The olders built the world that we're living in now
It's like us younger folk can't see that
Oh eleven where the old are an inconvenience
To be placed to the side
Society ain't got space for their type
Society's like 'this lot are wasting our time
They're taking our room and breathing our air
And times are hard so believe we can't share
That's what it is, so if YOU wanna live
You won't receive a chance here

Two thousand and eleven these days
Flats are built to last 10 years tops
All it takes is a change of agenda
Sign a contract, and then they're dropped
These days saving's a myth
When your paycheck mostly goes to renting your plot
Add utilities, bingo! Bye bye money
It stinks like a stench in a bog
So that means we know what it is
It's the reason why we get loans or a bit
What d'you think guys do things on the side for?
With a mentality like "bun the tight laws!"
When all's said it's survival the fight's for
Nobody wants to be left in the race
Nobody wants to be left on their face
With all of that clear we're not resting again

The year's 2011
Some say there's only one year left
Judgement Day paranoia is spreading
I'm glad to say it's not come here yet
I guess you'd only think that way
If you really truly are scared of your death
But I can't live my life living it warily
That's why I leave the fear to the rest
I keep calm and carry on doing mine
That's the football, the family and grime
The genre lasted all of this time
At times it was dodge, nowadays it's fine
See them three things that I mentioned?
Without them I'd lose all momentum
