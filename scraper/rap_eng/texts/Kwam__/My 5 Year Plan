All this chat about planning ahead
If you ask me you're all mad in the head
Stop all the chat about long-term
You're acting like say this ain't God's world
I'm not saying don't have a plan, do bruv
I'm just saying don't rely on it too much
You gotta keep on thinking of new stuff
Who knows when a plan's gonna go pear-shaped?
You don't wanna end up tear-faced
When you got no leg to stand on and you've got bare weight
Telling me you gotta plan ahead, yeah fair play
But it's no use if you stay too rigid
How you gonna have a life and you don't live it?
I hate hearing that, it makes me livid!
Man want an answer to where I'll be in five years
I'm sorry but I'm not gonna give it

How can I say where I'm gonna be in five years
When I don't know if I'll get to the morning?
I live my life a turn of the world at a time
And I'm still not sure of my calling
This tune isn't supposed to be morbid
Still see me with a smile when I'm talking
Despite that, we don't know when it's all done
So I don't waste time when I'm walking

....I just keep on
Putting one foot in front of the other
Trying to be a good first son to my mother
And be there for my father, sister and brothers
That's just one of my plans amongst others
Don't come around me trying to play silly buggers
If I say I'm gonna be in this place at that time and it flops
Believe me, that WILL be a bunner
And I ain't talking no weed man
Yeah it might sound like gas when I say I don't need plans
But I really don't, they're just there
I can't hear man telling me I must care
Won't find anybody making a fuss here
We're just doing our ting dot com
I'm not hyping the steeds up any more
Last time I did, the ting got long

How can I say where I'm gonna be in five years

No I can't say where I'll be when I'm 30
At the minute I'm too busy laughing
Go and come back and I'll still be on a calm ting
But don't mistake my calm for skylarking
Don't think that I live life by chancing
My mate would say I'm on point if you ask him
You probably think I'm starved of success, not really
This whole time I've been fasting
Eating at times when a man couldn't see
Not focused on anybody else but me
There's a thousand ways of living in London
I'm not stressed if I don't break in the scene
I got a good frame and a good brain so I'm okay
I'm gonna be someone either way
When it's gonna happen I don't need to say
Furthermore, I can't anyway
