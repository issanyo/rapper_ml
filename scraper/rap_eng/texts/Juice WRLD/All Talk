[Chorus]
I remember Ring Pops
Now it's Rollie stopwatch
Went and bought a new Glock
Lookin' for a new opp
I've been workin' nonstop
First day of the year
Until when the ball drops
Diamonds, rubies everywhere
Look like I got small pox
You niggas' all talk
My niggas' all shot
Don't get us pissed off, yeah
You niggas' all talk
My niggas' all shot
Don't get us pissed off, yeah

[Chorus]
I remember Ring Pops
Now it's Rollie stopwatch
Went and bought a new Glock
Lookin' for a new opp
I've been workin' nonstop
First day of the year
Until when the ball drops
Diamonds, rubies everywhere
Look like I got small pox
You niggas' all talk
My niggas' all shot
Don't get us pissed off, yeah
You niggas' all talk
My niggas' all shot
Don't get us pissed off, yeah

[Chorus]
I remember Ring Pops
Now it's Rollie stopwatch
Went and bought a new Glock
Lookin' for a new opp
I've been workin' nonstop
First day of the year
Until when the ball drops
Diamonds, rubies everywhere
Look like I got small pox
You niggas' all talk
My niggas' all shot
Don't get us pissed off, yeah
You niggas' all talk
My niggas' all shot
Don't get us pissed off, yeah
