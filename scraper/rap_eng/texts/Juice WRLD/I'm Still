[Intro]
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Like oh, ooh-oh, oh

[Chorus]
I'm holding my breath and watching my step
I'm listing regrets and you made that list
You're my depression
Your first impression was in deception
You were lyin'
Bitch, I'm still flexin' with my heart broken
Got my heart open, I'm not hidin'
Bitch, I'm still moving, I'm in slow motion
I rolled my dosage, I'm getting higher
Bitch, I still, I still love my pills, Advils
You can't feel, I feel, you can't feel, I feel
Bitch, I still, I still love my pills, Advils
You can't feel, I feel, you can't feel, I feel
Oh, ooh-oh, oh
Oh, ooh-oh, oh

[Verse]
Fell in love with your face off the shrooms
The way it animates your eyes in the room
I can see the stars when I'm gazing at you
Now I need the car with the stars in the roof
Elephant all in the room, she buried me in a tomb
I'm feeling over consumed
She walking me to my doom, I see her face in my room
When I'm alone in the room, I'ma blame that on the shrooms
Oh, feeling ridiculed, feeling like a fool, don't know what to do
Lost my heart, don't got shit to lose

[Chorus]
I'm holding my breath and watching my step
I'm listing regrets and you made that list
You're my depression
Your first impression was in deception
You were lyin'
Bitch, I'm still flexin' with my heart broken
Got my heart open, I'm not hidin'
Bitch, I'm still moving, I'm in slow motion
I rolled my dosage, I'm getting higher
Bitch, I still, I still love my pills, Advils
You can't feel, I feel, you can't feel, I feel
Bitch, I still, I still love my pills, Advils
You can't feel, I feel, you can't feel, I feel
Oh, ooh-oh, oh
Oh, ooh-oh, oh
