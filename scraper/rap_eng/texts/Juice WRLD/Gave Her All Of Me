[Chorus]
Met her in the Summer, later the fall of me
Yeah, such a bummer
I gave the bitch all of me
Met her in the summer, later the fall of me
And it's such a bummer
Cause I gave the bitch all of me

[Verse 1]
I gave her my all, yeah, yeah
I showed her my flaws, yeah, yeah
Round of applause, you got me
But I still won, becuase you topped me in your back seat
In an all black cavalier, don't you remember, that December
Admit, lil bitch don't be scared
Don't you remember? You were my little sinner

[Chorus]
Met her in the Summer, later the fall of me
Yeah, such a bummer
I gave the bitch all of me
Met her in the summer, later the fall of me
And it's such a bummer
Cause I gave the bitch all of me

[Verse 2]
I gave her all of me
I gave her all of me, physically, spiritually, oh
Fake Spiritual hoe
I gave her all of me
Mentally leavin' me cold, takin' love from my soul
Love Respect, in that order, I gave her all of me
Even walked across the water, I gave her all of me
Hopped the fences, crossin' borders
I gave her all of me, literally all of me

[Chorus]
Met her in the Summer, later the fall of me
Yeah, such a bummer
I gave the bitch all of me
Met her in the summer, later the fall of me
And it's such a bummer
Cause I gave the bitch all of me
