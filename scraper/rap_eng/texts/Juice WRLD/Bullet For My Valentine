[Intro]
Hayo, you've been a wonderful audience
For our last song (we goin' in there)

[Chorus]
Uh-huh, uh-huh, I know you love me, but I know I'm not enough
I know you regretting the day you fell in love
You see me falling victim to the double cup
Past mistakes keep catching up
Guys from the past coming after ya
This shit like Scott & Ramona
In love with you, ain't even know ya
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
Evil ex, you always telling me about the evil ex
You tell me it's something I gotta experience
I feel like I can't compare like
Why in the hell do you care still
His name in my ear like bad bells
How the fuck should I feel
When I know he's caressing you and your head still

[Bridge]
Damn, life hit me hard that time-time-time
Imma' serve my time-time-time
Heart break sentence for life-life-life, life-life

[Chorus]
Uh-huh, uh-huh, I know you love me, but I know I'm not enough
I know you regretting the day you fell in love
You see me falling victim to the double cup
Past mistakes keep catching up
Guys from the past coming after ya
This shit like Scott & Ramona
In love with you, ain't even know ya
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 2]
No connection
You tell me there was no connection
Once upon a time, there was wifi
But that system started failin', yeah
Ventin' to me, tattle-tellin', yeah
You not from here, you're an alien
You told me that you're from Mercury
Let's take off, I guess I'll meet you there (At your home planet)
I'm gone off the Jackson, no Janet
You hate it when I'm high, sit down, you can't stand it
Funny thing is we both get high, god damn it
South by Southwest, she was off the xans rambling

[Chorus]
Uh-huh, uh-huh, I know you love me, but I know I'm not enough
I know you regretting the day you fell in love
You see me falling victim to the double cup
Past mistakes keep catching up
Guys from the past coming after ya
This shit like Scott & Ramona
In love with you, ain't even know ya
Yeah, yeah, yeah
