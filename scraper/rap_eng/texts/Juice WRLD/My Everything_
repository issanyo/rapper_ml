Lyrics From Snippet

[Chorus]
I had a dream you left me
I woke up scared to death
'Cause I won't have nothing left if you leave me
I had a dream you left
I woke up scared to death
'Cause I won't have nothing left
You're my everything

[Verse]
It's funny when they tell me I'm a sad boy
Bitch, what you think I'm using all the drugs for?
Wreck the Benz truck while listenin' to Benz Truck, huh
I won't be sad no more
Somewhere down the line I met a sad girl
Next thing you know, she in my bed
Next thing you know, she in my world
Next thing you know, she in my head

[Bridge]
Let's add a little drama to the scene
This is where I tell you that I love you when you leave
This is where you tell me that I don't mean anything
Then that's where I tell you that you are my everything

[Chorus]
I had a dream you left me
I woke up scared to death
'Cause I won't have nothing left if you leave me
I had a dream you left
I woke up scared to death
'Cause I won't have nothing left
You're my everything
