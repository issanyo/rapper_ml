[Intro]
Yeah
This one for all the people that believe in me
We gon' make it there
Juice
Juice

[Chorus]
You still at the bottom
I’m still at the bottom I'm not goin' anywhere
I’m chasin' the stardom
Might happen tomorrow
Just hold on I know we gone' make it there
We could look in the past and just drop it
But if you gone' keep it I guess we could take it there
They say life is a game
Well if that is the case then I guess I'm just not gone' be playing fair
You still at the bottom
I'm still at the bottom I'm not goin’ anywhere
I’m chasin' the stardom
Might happen tomorrow
Just hold on I know we gone’ make it there
We could look at the past or just drop it
But if you gone' keep it I guess we could take it there
They say life is a game
Well if that is the case then I guess I'm just not gone' be playing fair

[Verse 1]
Fuck everybody they hate me
Hold hands and jump off of that fucking cliff
Imma start off by answering unanswered questions
The answer is no you can’t fuck with this
But you don't have to
Lets cut to the chase I'm a god of a rapper
And when I say cut to the chase
I mean run off and hope I don't stab you
Hope I don't have to
Fuckin' attack you
Spittin' more ink than a mafuckin tattoo
Bitch I'm not bashful
Bitch I will bash you
You just a sack to my tackle
I'm just a rapper with weapons
Wrappin' this rap up in raps
So I guess I'm just wrappin' it up
Life is a drug so I trip like a Klutz
To the point where I'm really not giving a fuck
I think that I'm crazy
Fuck it I know that I lost it
Ain't using my brain so I might as well toss it
If you don't like me then jump in a coffin
I bet you're exhausted
Poke out your eyes so you can't see me flossin
And cut off your tongue so I can't hear you talkin'
Cut off your ears so you can't hear me yappin'
I ain't mean to wake yo ass up with my rappin'

[Chorus]
You still at the bottom
I'm still at the bottom I'm not goin' anywhere
I'm chasin' the stardom
Might happen tomorrow
Just hold on I know we gone' make it there
We could look at the past or just drop it
But if you gone' keep it I guess we could take it there
They say life is a game
Well if that is the case then I guess we just not gone' be playing fair
You still at the bottom
I'm still at the bottom I'm not goin' anywhere
I'm chasin' the stardom
Might happen tomorrow
Just hold on I know we gone' make it there
We could look at the past or just drop it
But if you gone' keep it I guess we could take it there
They say life is a game
Well if that is the case then I guess I'm just not gone' be playing fair

[Verse 2]
Im up with the rockets
Im so outta pocket
I take off I'm out of this atmosphere
I'm so out of this world
I'm so out of my mind
I'm so out of my place
I'm so out of here
Please get out of my way before I go insane
And then put yo ass out of your misery
All these niggas say that I'm so out of it
Well I guess I don't know whats gotten into me
I'm just cruisin' and coolin'
I vibe to survive and I hope you pick up on my energy
Catch his ass while he snoozin' that's straight homicide
If you ever try takin' some shit to me
Swear the girl is the love of my life
It's a cheating if I say that life is a bitch to me
And I mean if I tell you to go straight to hell
And that you niggas do not mean shit to me

[Chorus]
You still at the bottom
I'm still at the bottom I'm not goin' anywhere
I'm chasin' the stardom
Might happen tomorrow
Just hold on I know we gone' make it there
We could look at the past or just drop it
But if you gone' keep it I guess we could take it there
They say life is a game
Well if that is the case then I guess I'm just not gone' be playing fair
You still at the bottom
I'm still at the bottom I'm not goin' anywhere
I'm chasin' the stardom
Might happen tomorrow
Just hold on I know we gone' make it there
We could look at the past or just drop it
But if you gone' keep it I guess we could take it there
They say life is a game
Well if that is the case then I guess I'm just not gone' be playing fair

[Outro]
Not gone' be playing fair
Not gone' be playing fair
Yeah
I'm just not gone be playing fair
They say life is a game
Well if that is the case then I guess I'm just not gone be playing fair
