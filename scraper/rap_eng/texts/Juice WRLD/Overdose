[Chorus]
She do coke while I sip codeine
Rap game, crack game servin to the dope fiends
She like courtside, still catchin nose bleeds
9-1-1, this bitch boutta OD
Passed out on my couch, someone take her out
Medics in n' out, tellin her breath in n' out
Neighbors nosier than a bitch, askin' me what's this about
Shorty took too many drugs, tryna overdose for clout

[Verse]
Molly on her tongue, got her goin dumb
She older than me, she know that I'm young, but I'm not young and dumb
Fuck a bitch, get a bitch sprung
Pull up on a scene, they run
I pull out my gun, heater on me
Kinda like the sun, bitch I'm not the one
Fuck with me, choppa get you smoked like a chimney
Jiminy, cricket how they jumpin on my wave, B
It's crazy, now I'm making money on the daily
I'd be hating on me too, if I wasn't gettin paid
I'd be hating on me too, if I wasn't gettin laid
On a daily basis, on a daily basis
Presidential brain, from your main Sarah Pailin
Tryna judge a nigga, you don't even got a Bailiff

[Chorus]
She do coke while I sip codeine
Rap game, crack game servin to the dope fiends
She like courtside, still catchin nose bleeds
911, this bitch boutta OD
Passed out on my couch, someone take her out
Medics in n' out, tellin her breath in n' out
Neighbors nosier than a bitch, askin' me what's this about
Shorty took too many drugs, tryna overdose for clout

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
She do coke while I sip codeine
Rap game, crack game servin to the dope fiends
She like courtside, still catchin nose bleeds
911, this bitch boutta OD
Passed out on my couch, someone take her out
Medics in n' out, tellin her breath in n' out
Neighbors nosier than a bitch, askin' me what's this about
Shorty took too many drugs, tryna overdose for clout
