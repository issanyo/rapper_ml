[Chorus]
It's the same old things
I say all the same things
In my mind, they're haunting
The darkness distracts me
Cause my heart is hurting
Heal it with the money
That don't mean a damn thing, that don't mean a damn thing

[Verse]
I'm fine, I lied
I'm doing all the best things, havin' the worst time
She'll leave soon, almost her time
And I was feelin' real love for the first time
Hate it when she gets like this
Ain't no gettin' to her, Ain't no gettin' through her
Lovin' her is a slit to the wrist
Sadness cutting through her, ain't no gettin' to her
