Lyrics From Snippet

[Intro]
Woman speaking
CardoGotWings

[Chorus]
She say she know and I be tellin' a lie
She told me I'm like all of those other guys
Well, alright, alright
Alright, yeah yeah, alright
In my anxiety I'm buried alive
Some of your words are fuels to fire
Catastrophic when you ignite
Do you still want this? You decide
Well, alright, alright
Alright, yeah yeah, alright
Alright, alright
Alright, yeah yeah, alright

[Verse 1]
Haha, yeah, mood change, mood change
You have a rainbow on your head [?] moon rain, moon rain
I do anything I can to see you happy, happy
I know I am not enough, that's okay, okay

[Pre-Chorus]
Ah, I'll be strong, make me feel like I belong, yeah
Ah, I'll be strong, make me feel like I belo-o-ong

[Chorus]
She say she know and I be tellin' a lie
She told me I'm like all of those other guys
Well, alright, alright
Alright, yeah yeah, alright
In my anxiety I'm buried alive
Some of your words are fuels to fire
Catastrophic when you ignite
Do you still want this? You decide
Well, alright, alright
Alright, yeah yeah, alright
Alright, alright
Alright, yeah yeah, alright
