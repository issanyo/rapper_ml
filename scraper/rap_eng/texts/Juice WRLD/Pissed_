Lyrics From Snippet

[Verse]
Machete, mm
Comin' with pistols, I'm pissed
Off this Perc, big, huh
Barely breathin'
I'm high off the finest lean, I feel like I'm a eagle
You think you're a bitch, uh huh
I'ma put a bullet hole in your ego
God damn, I love my straps
But, no, I don't fuck with these people
Bitch, I'ma [?] off the lean, yeah
Got your ho gassed up, still fucked her on E (Oh yeah)
New Bentley truck, red seats (Oh yeah)
Ain't even keep the receipt (Oh yeah)
[?] (Yeah)
All this [?] clean (Yeah)
Walk in the room, look like a hundred G's, uh
Fuck nigga sayin'? He ain't takin' my watch, nigga, please, uh
Folks on the Internet show his Glock, uh, nigga, please, uh
All my guns got a cold, I'm gon' make 'em sneeze
I say my wrist is enchantin'
