[Intro]
Enviyon on the mix
When I saw her

[Chorus 1]
When I saw her
It was like a daydream, felt like yesterday
I won't love her
Love is such a sad thing, giggles in the way
I'm a stalker
I can see you're comin' from a hundred miles away
I should call her
Ring, ring, ring, baby, please don't make me wait, me wait

[Verse 1]
Let's have dinner by the lake
You can meet me 45 past 8
You look beautiful today
But I guess it's everyday, okay
I don't wanna fall in love
But you makin' it too hard for me
I know I'm stuck in my ways
But you been stuck in my mind all day
You been stuck in my mind all day
You been stuck in my mind all day
All day

[Chorus 2]
When I saw her
It was like a daydream, I think I'm awake
I might love her
Love is such a new thing, giggles in the way
I'm a stalker
I can see you're comin' from a million miles away
I'ma call her
Ring, ring, ring, baby, please don't make me wait

[Verse 2]
Let's take a walk across the beach
Let's go to my favorite place, LA
Don't know what's happenin' to me
I think I'm fallin' in love, no way
Girl, this gotta be a dream
Damn, I gotta stay awake, awake
Now I find it hard to breathe
Every time I see your face, your face

[Chorus 3]
When I saw her
It was like a daydream, I know I'm awake
Yeah I love her
Love is such a strong thing, can't keep it away
I'm a stalker
I can hear her breathin' from a million miles away
I'ma call her
Ring, ring, ring, baby, please give me your time o' day (Day, day, day)

[Outro]
Please give me your time o' day (Day, day, day)
