[Chorus]
I'ma have a party tonight, go tell your friends bitch
You ain't gettin' money, then you ain't gettin' in bitch
Leave the heartbreak, at the crib bitch
Come to L.A., I can show you how I live bitch
Bet I get Wetter Wet, like a cruise ship
She been flexin' hard on my name, Terry Crews shit
No more parties in L.A., Kanye West shit
She do Codeine with Cocaine, that's the best shit

[Verse]
Think I found the love of my life (Where she at?)
In a bottle, in a bottle
Codeine up in my Sprite
Baby bottle, baby bottle
I'm lookin' at my future like, Hi, Hey!
You look so bright (Bling, bling)
The VVS on my wrist, so ice (Bling, bling)
But somethin' in my chest don't feel right
Somethin' in my chest don't feel too good
Thought I left my heartbreak in my old hood
Ex bitch in my phone, up to no good
Ole gold diggin' bitch you know you ain't gettin' no goods
I ain't really feelin' too good
The pills make me feel too good
I know you want me no more
So I put my heart on the floor

[Chorus]
I'ma have a party tonight, go tell your friends bitch
You ain't gettin' money, then you ain't gettin' in bitch
Leave the heartbreak, at the crib bitch
Come to L.A., I can show you how I live bitch
Bet I get Wetter Wet, like a cruise ship
She been flexin' hard on my name, Terry Crews shit
No more parties in L.A., Kanye West shit
She do Codeine with Cocaine, that's the best shit
