[Hook]
I know the secrets to you baby
You say the drugs, they drive me crazy
I don't believe a word you say
You're the one that's drivin' me insane
No more getting in my way
No more ruining my day
No more getting in my way
No more ruining my day

[Verse]
I fly high, on planes
Crash down, but I am not afraid
Lost in life, like a maze
I'm so high, I'm amazed
That you were still walkin' through my brain
Killing me and driving me insane
I don't know why you won't go away
You're just another problem that I face
Speakin' of face, I can't feel my
You've been away for such a long time
Keep tellin' myself that it's alright
Keep tellin' myself, but it's all lies
Keep tellin' myself that it's alright
Speakin' of face, I can't feel my
Speakin' of face, I can't feel my

[Hook]
I know the secrets to you baby
You save the drugs, to drive me crazy
I don't believe a word you say
You're the one that's drivin' me insane
No more getting in my way
No more ruining my day
No more getting in my way
No more ruining my day

[Outro]
No more, no more
No more, no more
No more, no more
No more, no more
No more drving me insane
No more xanny to the brain
No more driving me insane
No more getting in my way
No more, no more
No more, no more
No more, no more
No more, no more
No more driving me insane
No more xanny to the brain
No more driving me insane
No more, no more
