[Bridge]
Smoke cigarettes, cancer in the chest
Like cardiac arrest
I've been feeling stressed, tryna find ways to impress her
Showin' her that I love her, tryna show her my effort
Gotta keep it together

[Hook]
I dont wan' be lonely no more-ore
I dont wan' be lonely no more-ore
She picks my heart off the floor-oor
I'm addicted yeah I need me some more
I dont wan' be lonely no more-ore
I dont wan' be lonely no more-ore
She picks my heart off the floor-oor
I'm addicted yeah I need me some more

[Verse 1]
Oh oh
This a love letter that I wrote
She keep me up when I'm feeling low
She's my overdose-dose-dose
Being heartbroken is so last year
Haven't break down since she wiping my tears
Ive been feeling fine ever since she been mine
In other words, yeah, she changed my life
Open up like a book let her read me
One call away if she ever needs me
If I ever fall apart, I know she gon' keep me together
Treat me like a promise baby keep me forever
I dont wan' be lonely no more-ore
I dont wan' be lonely no more-ore
Imma meet you back at the chorus
P.S. Baby girl you're so gorgeous

[Bridge]
Smoke cigarettes, cancer in the chest

[Verse 2]
If I find my way to the bottom of this bottle
Shes in my head please dont get me started
I could talk about her all day
Shes on my mind always
If I find my way to the bottom of this bottle
Shes in my head please dont get me started
Thinkin' bout her all day
She's on my mind always
I dont wan' be lonely no more-ore
I dont wan' be lonely no more-ore
Imma meet you back at the chorus
P.S. Baby girl you're so gorgeous
