[Intro]
This song is literally my canvas, I can say whatever the fuck (Yeah)

[Chorus]
Drownin’ in the Hennessy
It feel like I’m dreamin'
They say liquor bad for me
They say I don’t need it
But I’ma drink the the whole fifth this evenin’
I’ma drink the whole fifth this evenin’
Sometimes I like codeine
Sometimes I like leanin'
Sometimes I like perkies
Sometimes I like beamin'
But I’ma drink the whole fifth this evenin’
I’ma drink this whole fifth this evenin’

[Verse: 1]
I’ma drink the whole damn fifth
Then I’ma fuck a bad ass bitch
Then I’ma take a few Xanax
So in the mornin’ I might forget
Now there’s some random bitch in my bed
But she says that she had a good time
Same girl keeps running through my head
I won’t let you get away this time
I gotta broke heart can you fix, mine
I gotta full cup come and sip, mine
I gotta new script come and flip, mine
I won’t let you get away this, time (Yeah)

[Chorus]
Drownin' in the Hennessy
It feel like I’m dreamin'
They say liquor bad for me
They say I don’t need it
But I’ma drink the the whole fifth this evenin’
I’ma drink the whole fifth this evenin’
Sometimes I like codeine
Sometimes I like leanin'
Sometimes I like perkies
Sometimes I like beamin'
But I’ma drink the whole fifth this evenin’
I’ma drink this whole fifth this evenin’

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
Drownin' in the Hennessy
It feel like I’m dreamin'
They say liquor bad for me
They say I don’t need it
But I’ma drink the the whole fifth this evenin’
I’ma drink the whole fifth this evenin’
Sometimes I like codeine
Sometimes I like leanin'
Sometimes I like perkies
Sometimes I like beamin'
But I’ma drink the whole fifth this evenin’
I’ma drink this whole fifth this evenin’
