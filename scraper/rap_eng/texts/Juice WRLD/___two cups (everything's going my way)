[Intro]
Enviyon on the mix

[Chorus]
Two cups, pour me up a A
New drugs, do you wanna taste
New girl, from around the way
New car, do you wanna race
Why these niggas in my way
High key, all these niggas lame
Nike, checkin out the game
Cartier, all up on my frames
Everything's going my way
Everything's going my way
Everything's going my way
Everything's going my way
Everything's going my way
Everything's going my way

[Verse 1]
Running up the money, come and go
Every day I'm balling on my own
Remember, I don't wanna be alone
Now I gotta get it on my own
I ain't never ever going broke
I ain't ever lovin on a hoe
Even tho I'm sluttin on the low
Bitches always frontin on the low
I just wanna pull up in the Rolls
Always rocking pretty nigga clothes
Ksubi jeans with the VLONE
Always got Ksubi jeans on
Always got pinky rings on
Get the green and put the team on
Get the green and put the team on
That's how that go
Double cup, get my lean on
Double cup, get my lean on
I'm in slow mo
Get the green and put the team on
Get the green and put the team on
That's how that go
Double cup, get my lean on
Double cup, get my lean on
I'm in slow mo
Get the green and put the team on
Get the green and put the team on

[Chorus]
Two cups, pour me up a A
New drugs, do you wanna taste
New girl, from around the way
New car, do you wanna race
Why these niggas in my way
High key, all these niggas lame
Nike, checkin out the game
Cartier, all up on my frames
Everything's going my way
Everything's going my way
Everything's going my way
Everything's going my way
Everything's going my way
Everything's going my way
