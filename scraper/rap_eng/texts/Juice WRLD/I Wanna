[Intro]
Sweatin' bullets boy

[Chorus]
Bitch you goin' hard, I'm goin' harder
VVS wetter than some water
Hey I know you see me ballin' like a starter
I want money, money, money in that order
Hey, young nigga, I could fuck yo daughter
Young nigga still could fuck yo momma
I do what I want because I wanna

[Verse 1]
I heard that yo nigga was a loser
I don't fuck with school, I'm Ferris Bueller
Fuck with me, I'm finna get my ruger
Pretty nigga, but I still be that shooter
Bad bitch look like she at Hooters
Glock clip lookin' like a ruler

Woah, time to switch my flow, yeah

Run up on me, dumb mama, let that Nina blow yeah

[Chorus]
Bitch you goin' hard, I'm goin' harder
VVS wetter than some water
Hey I know you see me ballin' like a starter
I want money, money, money in that order
Hey, young nigga, I could fuck yo daughter
Young nigga still could fuck yo momma
I do what I want because I wanna
I do what I want because I wanna

[Verse 2]
Surfin' on yo bitch, it got me wavy
Red bottom boolin' got me brazy
Finna come and take yo little lady
I'ma fuck that bitch and she gon' pay me
Gold grill flossin, got me pretty
Told that bitch, I never walk, I run the city
Keep a couple real killers, they be with me
Down to shoot a nigga in his kidney
Hey, what, I just be fuckin' that bitch again
Nigga I'm tryna get rich again, yeah
That's how I live again, yeah
Run in yo crib again, put the pistol to yo kids again, yeah

[Chorus]
Bitch you goin' hard, I'm goin' harder
VVS wetter than some water

Hey, young nigga, I could fuck yo daughter
Young nigga still could fuck yo momma
I do what I want because I wanna
