[Hook]
Uh, I don't feel like coming to the phone today
I wish everyone would leave me alone, uh
I don't feel like coming to the phone today, (ring, ring, ring me)

Uh, I don't feel like coming to the phone today
Everyone should just leave me alone, uh
I don't feel like coming to the phone today
I don't feel like bein' alone

[Bridge]
I can’t deal with the chills on my own, freezing all night long
Can't tell what's real, or where I belong

[Verse 1]
Uh, day to day same thoughts
This is all the devil's fault, I need an angel
Often, I pop, all three, I'm off, all three
So many fours like the rings on my Audi

Xans with the Everclear got me seeing foggy
I wonder how something clear got me seeing foggy
Somethin' ain't right bout' the pills but I bought em'
Somethin' ain't right with my mind so I lost it

Drugs turn my knob to the right that's a faucet
But it ain't water it's wine
I'm tired, I'm tired of getting high it's exhaustin'
I was told it'd get better with time (ring, ring, ring me)

[Hook]
Uh, I don't feel like coming to the phone today
Everyone should just leave me alone, uh
I don't feel like coming to the phone today
I don't feel like bein' alone

[Bridge]
I can’t deal with the chills on my own, freezing all night long
Can't tell what's real, or where I belong
