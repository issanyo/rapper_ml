[Hook]
You've been on my mind, since we first met
I've been gettin' high, it's a process
Heartbreak girl, we beyond that
Just be honest
The sorrow and the pain, I can't digest
Take my time, got no time left
Take my heart, all of my love
Just don't waste it
I was always scared to go find love
Waiting on cupid, to find us
But I'm on life in the hourglass, time up

[Verse]
I just caught feelings for my styrofoam cup
Lean put me down, but it's fillin' me up
Fallin' to the ground, shit is tearin' me up
I'm fucked up
I try to pretend I don't care so much
When I wake up, and I see that you're gone
Got me doin' drugs, walkin' into my room
Dear lost love, Dear lost love, Dear lost love
Got me doin' drugs, walkin' into my room
Dear lost love, Lost love
