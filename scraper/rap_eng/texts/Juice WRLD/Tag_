Run up, then gang tagged
Run up, then gang tagged
Everybody know my racks [?]
Everybody used to sad songs
Good heart gone bad
Emo shit I'm combattin'

Yeah I gotta keep my strap on
I live in a warzone
Please don't try at
This is where you die at
Gonna make this shit clear, might go platinum this year
Take a shit on my peers, said I wouldn't make it here
[?] by my lonely
VLone shit like Bari
At the crib fuckin' on wifey
I don't fuck with parties
Yeah
