Bad bitch, I hit it from the back, uh
I'm in Dior, spend a rack, uh
Maybe a rack on a rack, uh
Where I'm from, I say, "I'm from Chiraq", uh
Run up on me, them pistols'll clap, uh, yeah

Doped up like the 80's, huh
Big guns like the navy

[Verse 4]
Man, i could really talk some shit on this one
Pull the trues down, i could take a shit on this one
I feel like a baller, set a pick on this one
She wanna fan, she gon' take a pic on this one
Take a picture sitting on my dick, huh
Hit the filters up to make sure that it's fixed

Yo' girl fuckin', that bitch bashful
She got her hands in the air listenin' Beyonce
"Single ladies over here", that's what I say

[Verse 5]
Early to the party
Then again, I'm fashionably late off the molly
Run a train on yo' bitch
That's a stylish ass trolly
Out Dior, spend a couple pounds, nigga try me
Did I say, "a couple pounds"?
I meant a couple thousand
Money in my pocket, could build a platinum fountain
And if I pull up with security
That's my 40
Cause never in my life have i needed bouncers
I been so "fuck this" and so "fuck that'
My bitch talks up it, say, "Get the fuck back"
I feel like a crackhead hiding- woah
I feel like a crackhead hiding work how i spit crack
I got so much drive, if I stop it, you catchin' whiplash
I hit the strip club
Throw a couple bands on yo' bitch ass
I was getting cash ever since I was a youngin'
I feel like Drake and Future, ballin'
Jumpman, Jumpman, Jumpman
Pull up on me, get to bussin'
Choppa on me with combustion
My word is my weapon
So is my [?] and i got that from the West end
With a bad bitch, she bussin'
And he best friend more open than a book, uh
She fucked my cousin, I ain't even have to look, uh
Ain't talkin' boxing, I ain't gotta throw a hook
I freestyle crazy, kinda like an open book
That's probably cause when I was little I was reading books, uh

[Verse 6]
See, now I'm smarter
Got my arm in the rim
I'm ballin' like Vince Carter
Always ball like a starter
At yo' head like a barber
Bombin' hard, Pearl Harbor
Try me if you want it
You get smoked like a Backwood full of marijuana

[Outro]
Ain't no weed getting saved around me
That bitch fuck for free
That shit a guarantee
I'm in London, so I tell her she not my cup of tea
Talkin' dumb-
