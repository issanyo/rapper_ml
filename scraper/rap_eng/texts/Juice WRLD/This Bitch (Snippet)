[Lyrics from Snippet]

[Hook]
Back in this bitch
Smoking thrax in this bitch
Back in the day I was in the trap, moving packs in this bitch
Run up on me like a pimp, you get slapped in this bitch
40 like a bad hoe, on my lap in this bitch (huh)
Running too fast, that's a lap in this bitch (huh, yuh)
I go hard, cashin' n' shit
Pullin' up in an Aston n' shit
Wanna fight Chapo, left right left right like cashes n' shit
Cashin' n' shit

[Verse]
Cash out on a bitch
Damn right, I'ma hit
Damn right I make hits, I can't miss, I can't miss
Fuck your bitch in the kitchen
So everytime when she cooking you up grits, she reminiscing (you digg)
Damn I talk too much, I should really shut up
But I talk too much cause I'm a money maker
I say what I want, or don't say shit at all
Bitch, I shoot to kill
You shoot to make 'em fall
Bitch I feel like Vans, my shit be off the wall
Doing percocets while fuckin' with that adderrall
Bitch knock it off, come over here and top me off
And I can't gon' pick you up, but I'll drop you off
