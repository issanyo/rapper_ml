[Intro]
Please leave your message after the tone...
Hello?
Hello?
You need to hit me back...

[Chorus]
You used to call me on my trap phone
Late night when you need my drugs
You would call me on my trap phone
Late night when you need my drugs
And I think all that hotline bling
That could only mean one thing
I-I pick up that hotline bling
And I say that you titling

[Verse 1]
Brought the whole cartel with me, ooh!
You know I'm smokin' now
I got them drugs so pay that cut now
I'm serving everybody, I don't give a fuck now
Ev-Ever since I hit the city, you
You know I got the gas now
The cops be on my ass now
But I can never back down

[Chorus]
You used to call me on my trap phone
Late night when you need my drugs
Call me on my trap phone
Late night when you need my drugs
And I reply that hotline bling
That could only mean one thing
I reply that hotline bling
I swear you are titling

[Verse 2]
Brought the whole cartel with me, ooh!
You know they got the white now
I'm serving the people in the white house
Yeah we got that white now
Ever since I hit the city, you
You know I got the dope now
I look like I be selling dope now
Matter of fact I look like I be selling coke now!

[Chorus]
She used to call me on my trap phone
Late night when she needs my drugs
She would call me on my trap phone
Late night when she needs my drugs
And I reply like hotline bling
That cocaine got me a Gucci [?]
And I reply like hotline bling
I'm serving niggas I don't even take

[Verse 3]
You know how it go
I've been serving on a roll, baby
I've been serving after shows, baby
But I don't got it for the low, baby
I got the extacy to go, baby
I got the molly at the show, baby
She sucked me up and it's a [?], baby
She smoked a dope and now she going, baby

[Verse 3]
Just because she hit me on my trap phone
She was on my trap phone
I've been robbin' niggas all day, boy, I'm robbin' robbin' robbin' like a bad [?]
Now what the fuck does you want?
You ain't boomin' like my trap phone
But that bitch hit me on my trap phone
Yeah, that's you're bitch callin' on my trap phone

[Chorus]
She called me on my trap phone
Late night when she need my drugs
Call me on my trap phone
Late night when she need my...

[Outro]
Oh well
