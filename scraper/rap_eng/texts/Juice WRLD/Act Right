[Chorus: GDo & Juice WRLD]
You know I don't act right, act right
Sippin' act right while I song write
I can see her face in the fog lights
Let's get to the chase have a long night
Been a long day, been a long ride
Flag on the play that shit offsides
Now I'm getting high till I'm upside
Down in the dumps but I'm high so it's alright

[Verse 1: Juice WRLD]
She tell me that it's all my fault
Alright, been a long night hoping that I won't die
Remember when I met you on the North Side
Panties had you wetter than your first time
Super wet, yeah when I flex
Cause she love it when I flex
Imma hit it from the back
She don't stand a chance
But my heart under attack
I got too over-attached
No, not again, no not again
I got too over-attached
Once you leave you know she ain't coming back
She with him so I know she won't hit me back
No, not again, no not again
I got too over attached
Once you leave you know she ain't coming back
She with him so I know that she with hit me back

[Chorus: GDo & Juice WRLD]
You know I don't act right, act right
Sippin' act right while I song write
I can see her face in the fog lights
Let's get to the chase have a long night
Been a long day, been a long ride
Flag on the play that shit offsides
Now I'm getting high till I'm upside
Down in the dumps but I'm high so it's alright

[Verse 2: GDo]
I know I don't act right
Last time couldn't really be our last time
Getting high anticipating my last flight
In other worlds loving you is like suicide
I don't wanna lose
Go do what you do
I won't pity the fool
I'm gon' tell you the truth
Are you ready for the truth?
Cause the truth ready for you
Feel like you were mine in a past life
Now I'm too addicted to the fast life
I just had a blast like last night
Could've flat lined
But I only poured a half pint
I don't wanna lose
Go do what you do
I won't pity the fool
I'm telling you the truth
Are you ready for the truth?
Cause the truth ready for you
