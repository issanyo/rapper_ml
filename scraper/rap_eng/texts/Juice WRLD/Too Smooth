[Chorus]
I think I'm too smooth for my own good
Think I'm too smooth for my own good
I think I'm too smooth for my own good, ay ay ay (too smooth)
Think I'm too smooth for my own good
Same niggas came from my old hood
Yeah I'm too smooth for my own good, yeah yeah yeah

[Verse 1]
Let me tell you niggas what It's been like
This is real life, toting real knives, that's a real pint
Run up on you with a .40, shoot you five times
You pussy nigga, sure I shot you nine times
Ay, and that's real on the real shit
Scratch 'em off like a lil lotto quick pick
Burn a nigga, I ain't talking about incense
I ain't been the realest nigga since I was an infant (too smooth)

[Chorus 2]
Too smooth for my own good
Think I'm too smooth for my own good
Came with em OG's from my old hood
Yeah you know they always up to no good

[Verse 2]
Ay, shouts out to my dad for teaching me
To be free and I can be what I wanna be
Yeah, I came along way from piano
Now I'm playing these blocks, like I'm playing a soprano
Who these niggas was, thought they fuckin' with the kid
Run up on a nigga, probably pop you like a zit
Probably pop you like a zit, ay ay
Pussy you do not exist, ay ay

[Chorus 2]
Too smooth for my own good
Too smooth for my own good
Came with em OG's from the old hood
Too smooth for my own good

[Interlude]
Ay, you know I'm up to no good
Cause I'm trying to get some more good, yeah
All my niggas finna get good
Cause I'm too smooth for my own good, yeah

[Verse 3]
Still at it
Brother still whippin' in the kitchen serving addicts
Making work disappear, I ain't talking magic
Nigga talking tragic, then we catch his ass in traffic
Heard he stretch the truth and I ain't talking about elastic (too smooth)
That's just how we get it
.45 aiming at a pussy nigga vision
Niggas know I'm in it, in the cut like scissors
Make him disappear, he a motherfucking wizard, old pussy ass nigga (too smooth)


[Bridge]
Too smooth for my own good
Too smooth for my own good
Catch me running through my old hood
Too smooth for my own good
Pop a xan now it's all good
Papa's getting feed now its good
Too smooth for my own good
For my own good, for my own good

[Verse 4]
Yeah, and I still keep it going
Real nigga talking, so I still keep it flowing
In too deep in this street shit, like the ocean
These niggas talking stupid, but they never opposing
Cause they know I got the .30 and .40 it's reloading
It's TNT when I pull up cause that's a damn explosion
Yeah, and that's as real as it gets
I kill you and your mom, I'm as trill as it gets (too smooth)

[Outro]
Too smooth for my own good
Too smooth for my own good
You can catch me up to no good
Too smooth for my own good
