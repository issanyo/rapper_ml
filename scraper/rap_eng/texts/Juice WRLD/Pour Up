[Chorus]
I'm finna pour up a four, you finna pour up a one
You finna pick up a fist, I'm finna pick up a gun
I was just smokin' on piss, you was just smokin' on bum
I was just smokin' the flavor, you was just smokin' on nun
I'm finna pour up a four, you finna pour up a one
You finna pick up a fist, I'm finna pick up a gun
I just been smokin' on piss, you was just smokin on bum
I just been smokin the flavor, you ain't been smokin' on nun

[Verse: 1]
Came in this bitch with a couple of shooters, you with niggas beefin' over computers
Baby I'm tellin' you, your man a loser
Come this way, I know you be choosin'
Come this way, I know he gon' lose you
Pop Champaigne, and do Codeine, sometimes cocaine
On the way to the bank
You the, You the best that I ever had bitch, no Drake shit
I know I can get the pussy wet, no lake shit
Fuck all night, take percs by the cases
Get so high, I don't hear what she sayin
Somethin' 'boutta moon sign, somethin' 'bout a leo
I'm thinkin' of a orgy, I'm thinkin of a trio
She'll only cheat on me if you speak creo
Lost in Miami, gotta find her like nemo
Old dude, probably put (?) on her
Not surprised
Hope she ain't try to put who on me
I'm not the guy
She don't know what I do with my dark R
It's when I'm higher

[Chorus]
I'm finna pour up a four, you finna pour up a one
You finna pick up a fist, I'm finna pick up a gun
I was just smokin' on piss, you was just smokin' on bum
I was just smokin' the flavor, you was just smokin' on nun
I'm finna pour up a four, you finna pour up a one
You finna pick up a fist, I'm finna pick up a gun
I just been smokin' on piss, you was just smokin' on bum
I just been smokin' the flavor, you ain't been smokin' on nun


[Chorus]
I'm finna pour up a four, you finna pour up a one
You finna pick up a fist, I'm finna pick up a gun
I was just smokin' on piss, you was just smokin' on bum
I was just smokin' the flavor, you was just smokin' on nun
I'm finna pour up a four, you finna pour up a one
You finna pick up a fist, I'm finna pick up a gun
I just been smokin' on piss, you was just smokin' on bum
I just been smokin' the flavor, you ain't been smokin' on nun

Im finna roll up a zip
U finna roll up an eighth
I just cashed out on a whip
Baby i pullup in rafe
Gota stay away from 12
I can never catch a case
Niggas be talkin that shit
Get the hell out out my face

Get out my face
Get the hell out my face
Imma pullup with a kay
Sparky gone hit with a kay
Running from 12 everyday
Smoking this dope everyay
Baby i just hit a stain
Now im heading to the bank

Im finna pour up the wock
I finna pour up the tuss
I just pulled up in a range
My diamonds never finna rust

I just pulled up in a range
U just pulled up in a bus
I just pulled up in a range
U just pulled up in a bus
