[Verse 1] ???
I'm high as hell on this shit, man
Juice, what up, man?
I know you rollin' off them pills
I'm finna tweak on this bitch, man
Gang shit tho

I spaz on the track, y'all niggas so wack
In the booth turnt up, and Juice up next
Ring, ring on my line, yo bitch wanna sext
I don't ever call back, hell nah, just text

I'm a young ass nigga and I swung so blessed
Won't ever be broke, smoke dope for the sesh
Yeah I'm 'bout that life, I don't even need hoes
Left hook, right hook, knock a nigga out his soul

I just wanna get rich, gettin' money is the goal
Want a foreign ass whip with a bitch that's gold
With a fat ass crib, one of these count rolls
I need fame and ???, ooh shit gettin' old

[Juice WRLD]
Like woah, I'mma get the money then go
Pass the bitch like a give and go
I'm on a roll, I just want dough
I told you niggas what the fuck that I'm on

All of my niggas be rollin', these bitches be rollin'
They rollin' wit' us and we goin'
All of my niggas they gone blow when they strong
Got a gun on me so my life is long

Told you on demand, don't forget it
Boss with a god, I'mma aim at his vision
And it cut, give a fuck, hell nah, we scissors
Abracadabra, I turn to a wizard

Freestyle shit I don't even gotta write it
I can see the future like a muhfuckin' psychic
Girl gonna ride my dick like a bike
She a li'l ass bitch, call that shit Little Tikes

Muhfucka, yo girl that shit I like
Boy, told you I'm in it for real, duh
All of my niggas be rollin', I swear I be ???
I pop me a pill

All of my niggas go crazy
What the fuck is you, huh?
All of these niggas be lazy
But there's millions on my futon

Millions on my futon, ayy

[Mortal Kombat announcer] Finish him!

[Juice WRLD]
Uh, I'm goin'
These hoes, they be goin', they already know it
Hope Coconut Head told yo' girl it was snowin'
All of these bitches ain't loyal, they hoein'
Fuck is you talkin' 'bout, all of my niggas, they ballin'

Swear that they ballin' like Spalding

Taught you to auction
Gettin' money ,boy, I'm doin' these verses, the highest the offer
Look, boy I get high, me touch the sky
I'm too fly
Girls kissin' girls, I swear that they bi
And after I fuck, I tell they ass "bye"

Any nigga wanna come get it, I got it
Don't forget it, I'm moving up high
It's blurry ass vision
I swear these niggas talk dumb til I pull it out, shoot on the spot

Any nigga wanna come get it, we gone
I get this shit then I'm gone
I'm out workin' all night
I do all this rapping shit on my own

I need shouts out to my nigga Zay
You know that's the game though
And I feel like Future all day
'Cause when I turn up I get on beast mode

Sick of this rap game
Getting used to these cheap clothes
My Glock sing all day
Bitch, I ain't even talkin' 'bout legal

Stitch 'em up like Lilo
Run up on me, that's some dumb shit
These niggas talkin', they just starting rumours
But these bitches follow by assumptions

And I'm just tryna get this money
I get this money like it's nothing
It's Halloween when I come around
Mask on, we is snatching pumpkins

'F' everything, nigga I ain't even talkin' 'bout that I'm flunkin'
But all these niggas stupid, boy I'm A1, all these other niggas flunkin'
