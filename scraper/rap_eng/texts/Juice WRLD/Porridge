[Intro]
Yeah, it's early as fuck in the morning
It's like some early-in-the-fuckâ€“
Oh yeah it's on some early ass music too
Just waking up in like the 70's or something, yeah

[Chorus]
Good morning
Woke up smokin' gas in a foreign
I'm in Los Angeles with a bad bitch
And a savage
Got a ratchet
Let 'em have it
Pull up without warning (Skrrrt)
Sunny day but them bullets make it stormy
She gon' blow the whole team like porridge
You got lean, whatchu waiting for pour it, yeah

[Verse 1]
Book a flight, she from out the country
Bad lil bitch, she from Paris bring me some Givenchy
Cocaine got her fienin', yeah, gas got me dreamin', yeah, yeah
She call me everything except sober and single, yeah
In the strip club I'm just tryna mingle, yeah
Checkin' hoes lookin' at they ring finger, yeah
Got my Gucci jacket out the drycleaners, yeah
Gotta stay fresh, yeah, fresh to death, yeah
Easy season, all four seasons
Flex-finessin' all these women
Bad bitch, fat ass, bad habits
High fashion, fabric livin' lavish
Smokin' gas I ain't never on "E"
Outer space baby, yeah I'm outta your reach
Ball like NBA baby, yeah I'm outta your league
Fuck all night off a perky, don't get fatigued

[Chorus]
Good morning
Woke up smoking gas in a foreign
I'm in Los Angeles with a bad bitch
And a savage
Got a ratchet
Let 'em have it
Pull up without warning (Skrrrt)
Sunny day but them bullets make it stormy
She gon' blow the whole team like porridge
You got lean, whatchu waiting for pour it, yeah

[Verse 2]
I'm in Cali, Moonrock get the backwoods ready
Bro got a .40, cock it back, aim it steady
I do as I please, record deal under my feet
She tryna play me, I play her like PS3
Game on, VVS put my chains on
Hang on, lemme get rich and put the gang on
Two phones, one for the women and one for the hoes
Nowadays I could prolly fuck on the bad bitches back at home
That wouldn't let me hit, now they let me hit, split
Prolly fuck they friends, suck me for a quick fix
Don't forget it 'til you, look like I hit a lick, you
Love the way that she lick you, I buy like a pick you [?]

[Chorus]
Good morning
Woke up smoking gas in a foreign
I'm in Los Angeles with a bad bitch
And a savage
Got a ratchet
Let 'em have it
Pull up without warning (Skrrrt)
Sunny day but them bullets make it stormy
She gon' blow the whole team like porridge
You got lean, whatchu waiting for pour it, yeah
