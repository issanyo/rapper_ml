[Intro]
I can't take no chances, no chances
Lookin' at the, yuh, yuh

[Chorus]
I can't take no chances, no chances
Lookin' at the devil face to face, while she dancin'
I feel like a rebel, Marilyn, no Manson
She takin' advantage, she take me for granted
Heartbreak boolin' in my lungs, like cancer
Everybody playin' love games, it's a standard
I'm so pissed off, I feel like Bruce Banner
I forgot to show you to the door, mind my manners

[Verse]
I can do this on my own, fuck your help
I took my heart out my chest, and put it on my shelf
I told myself I wouldn't fall in love with anybody else
Next thing you know I'm on a dinner date, straight to hell
Funny thing is this not my first time here
I've been here so much, I'm really startin' to like hell
Toxic relationships got me killin' myself
On the phone with a therapist, bitch I need me some help
Shorty really got the key to my soul
Shorty play me like piano maestro
I was taught to let live and let go
I don't trust you, they gon' shoot you, they treat me like Metro
Cannon on my hip, like Metroid
Cupid wanna shoot, I'ma shoot back boy
Spinnin' Bobby Brown, that's the new crack boy
I'ma play this shit like a black JAG, boy

[Chorus]
I can't take no chances, no chances
Lookin' at the devil face to face, while she dancin'
I feel like a rebel, Marilyn, no Manson
She takin' advantage, she take me for granted
Heartbreak boolin' in my lungs, like cancer
Everybody playin' love games, it's a standard
I'm so pissed off, I feel like Bruce Banner
I forgot to show you to the door, mind my manners
