[Chorus]
I'm too much to grasp
You know you won't get me
You want my cash
You gotta come get me
I'm with the girl of my dreams
She with me
I told my ex to die slow
Don't miss me
Too much to grasp
You know you won't get me
You want my cash
You gotta come get me
I'm with the girl of my dreams
She with me
I told my ex to die slow
Don't miss me

[Verse 1]
I told my ex to die slow she can
My other ex could race her to hell and
I'll go through hell just to get a benz
Free all my niggas locked up in jail and
I will never love a hoe again
I get the girl I want and she loves me
My ex told me we should try again
I said I'll break your heart like you did me
I hope your boyfriend fucks and you miss me
I hope you say my name when he's hitting
I hope you think of me when you're kissing
I hope you call I'll decline I'm busy
I keep on balling Kobe I'm swishing
You must be having an off game you're missing
You got no money, that chump change you're getting
My Rollie cost the crib that you're renting
Ah, you got no money, that chump change you're gettin
My Rollie cost the crib that you're renting

[Chorus]
I'm too much to grasp
You know you won't get me
You want my cash
You gotta come get me
I'm with the girl of my dreams
She with me
I told my ex to die slow
Don't miss me
Too much to grasp
You know you won't get me
You want my cash
You gotta come get me
I'm with the girl of my dreams
She with me
I told my ex to die slow
Don't miss me

[Verse 2]
I told my ex I'll see her in hell
Matter of fact I don't wanna go there
I told my girl I'll give her the world
Lets go to London I gotta show there
Forgive the past I left all my hoes there
We're moving fast there no moving slow here
Girl if we crash atleast it was worth it
I'll make it last you'll make me feel perfect

[Outro]
I want to be held close
I feel distant
I feel all alone
I said I want to be held close
I feel distant
I feel all alone (all alone)
To be held close
I feel distant
All alone (all alone)
