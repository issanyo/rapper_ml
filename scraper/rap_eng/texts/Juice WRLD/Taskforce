[Chorus]
Take off, fast four
In a black Porsche
Whippin' all the white, even though I'm a black boy
Terry Crews, flexin' on your crew, steroids
She lookin' at us, like I love them boys
Take off, fast four
In a black Porsche
Whippin' all the white, even though I'm a black boy
Terry Crews, flexin' on your crew, steroids
Lookin' at us, like damn I love them boys

[Verse 1]
Pull up Taskforce, in a four door
Choppa on my hip, it's heatin' up like human torch
If I catch him I'ma score, wait
Hit the floor
Then I take his whore, in that order
Bought a bunch of Gucci bitch, that cost about a quarter
25k not 25 cents bitch, oh yeah
Big gun make a nigga walk with a limp bitch, oh yeah
I still wear bathin' ape, no chimp bitch, oh yeah
Everyday I poor, lean
Need some more
Broke niggas, askin' the cost I tell em a quarter
25, no not 25 cents bitch, oh yeah
25 Pints cost 25 bricks bitch, oh yeah

[Chorus]
Take off, fast four
In a black Porsche
Whippin' all the white, even though I'm a black boy
Terry Crews, flexin' on your crew, steroids
She lookin' at us, like I love them boys
Take off, fast four
In a black Porsche
Whippin' all the white, even though I'm a black boy
Terry Crews, flexin' on your crew, steroids
Lookin' at us, like damn I love them boys

[Verse 2]
Need a beautiful girl, No Sean Kingston
Life of a lonely boy, all these hoes tweakin'
She gon' suck me in the back of the Porsche, then she leavin'
Hit her pussy good, I'm a hit then repeat
Hit it 3 times, call the shit 3-Peat
I've been xan free, almost been 3 weeks
Still on beans, still on percs, still on Codeine
She say coke, ain't a joke
She get nose bleeds
She finna OD, Don't call the police
Pray the drugs don't take her home, yeah
Say that she ok, but she not ok
Molly takin' over her soul
Another love goes down the drain, where it belongs
Another love goes, where the drugs go

[Chorus]
Take off, fast four
In a black Porsche
Whippin' all the white, even though I'm a black boy
Terry Crews, flexin' on your crew, steroids
She lookin' at us, like I love them boys
Take off, fast four
In a black Porsche
Whippin' all the white, even though I'm a black boy
Terry Crews, flexin' on your crew, steroids
Lookin' at us, like damn I love them boys
