[Chorus]
The race is beginnin'
Everybody push to start their engines (Skrrt)
The race is beginnin'
Everybody push to start their engines
Re-Re-Red light, yellow light, go!
Red light, yellow light, go
Red light, yellow light, go
Everybody push to start their engines

[Verse 1]
Caught him at the red light, had to leave him dead right
Shoot him in his head, right
We don't aim for legs, right
Ride around your hood, like my name was lil Red Ride
Out of soda, I've been pourin' up the red wine
Doctor told me that it's supposed to help me unwind
Takin' them xannies, I'ma fuck around and stop time
Freshman year, I was poppin' pills in the lunch line

[Chorus]
The race is beginnin'
Everybody push to start their engines (Skrrt)
The race is beginnin'
Everybody push to start their engines
Red light, yellow light, go!
Red light, yellow light, go
Red light, yellow light, go
Everybody push to start their engines

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
The race is beginnin'
Everybody push to start their engines (Skrrt)
The race is beginnin'
Everybody push to start their engines
Red light, yellow light, go!
Red light, yellow light, go
Red light, yellow light, go
Everybody push to start their engines
