[Verse 1]
Hold up wait a minute let me get my cup and pour me up a double
Ballin' on these niggas fuck around and Imma get a triple double
I've been flexin' on my exes I don't really have to move a muscle
If you wanna be a dummy run up on em' bake em' like a oven
I just want a Lamborghini pull up seats same color candy
I just wanna fuck her bust a nut and leave puddle in her panties
I just wanna buy my mom a house and get a grammy for my granny
I just wanna catch a fuck nigga with the semi automatic
He dont really want the ratchet
If he want it he can have it

Bitch you gotta be the baddest
Fuckin' hoes in designer clothes just became another bad habit
I know niggas still in the kitchen whippin wrappin dope up in plastic
I know they gone' get the message
They know ballin' is a habit
If you want it then we got it

And you know I got my girl with me I could never ever leave without her
Never ever leave without her
