Yo girl look like sprinkler system from the way I get her wetter

I'ma go hard, catch the shot like Belly
I'm the best to ever do it, have 'em leakin' body fluids
Feel like Waka Flocka "O Let's Do It" when I'm on this music
Off the dome when I'm kickin' it
Kinda like I got an impediment when I'm spittin' it
I been rippin' writtens without writing a damn thing
I'm Doin' my damn thing, I rap and I sing
I ring like bells, king
That's me, you better king me

Yo bitch too sleazy, 40 bless yous, sneezin'

Uh, breaking Bad method how I sell this meth
Retrospect, put that shit back in retrospect
Take yo specs, take yo bitch, grab her breast, tat her chest
I'm the best to ever do it, I'ma say that again
Lord forgive me on this mic, 'cause I know I'm finna sin
Killin' him, him, and him, referencin' Eminem
All these other rappers ain't shit but thinnin' in
I don't really got time for it
They can have a penny cause I don't really have a dime for it
Catch me rockin' Tom Ford and some Air Forces
With a passport and a black torch
Comin' up the full court, pressed like Kobe or somethin'
Super clutch in the fourth like Ginobili or somethin'
You say you ballin' like you Jordan nigga, nah, you frontin'
Run up on me that's okay, that choppa on me get the Jumpman

Im'ma the best to ever do it, say that again
Off the dome, kickin' it, that's just how it is
I don't got to write shit, I see it like a psychic
Your girl like a Huffy commercial, she ride like bikes, kid
I'm the best to ever do it, yeah I said it and I meant it
Listen to my lyrics, man I vibe on this bitch
Roll a blunt up, a OG, and get high on this bitch
Mix it with the pills and liquor, I may die on this bitch
Dude, I do that shit on purpose, suicide in that bitch
Suicide doors with a suicide whore
Drivin' off a bridge, I call that a suicide Porsche
We kickin' it, man, look
I pull up in a four-door flippin' like parkour
Fuck yo bitch on camera and call that shit a hardcore
Hard porn, Sharper than hard poons
I come through with three bullets in my face, that's a war room
Animated like cartoons when I'm off the shrooms
Niggas dirty so they choppas actin' like brooms
Niggas salty like Spongebob and spittoon
Pull up on the scene, that's just me
Hey, switch that shit up real quick
I may come back to that, I don't know

[Verse 2]
Uh-huh, I was just talkin' about how I like Tyler and then cole
Uh, Im'ma, uh
I'ma fuckin' Dapper Dan in a pair of Gucci socks
Runnin' up on me you get popped
Catch the shot out the Glock, I'm the Juice, word to Pac
Run up on me, pop the top, matter of fact, better back up
Cause I'm in the back of the truck with the MAC tucked
Turn that nigga into a condiment or somethin', he need to catch up
He can't catch us, them niggas can't back us
Man, them niggas need some backup
I'm on the scene, boolin' with my bros
Like Drake with the 6, runnin' through it with my woes
Run up on me like Shaquille and the paint I'm throwin' bows
You a ballerina cause I keep you on your toes
Shout out to them Florida niggas, I know some zos
Run up, that's okay, I'm finna let the choppa blow
I'm on Westwood, ridin' through yo hood
Like Red Ridin', strikin' like bright lightnin', my flow is too excitin'
I'll end yo world like Mayans, off the dome, kickin' it
Try me if you think I'm lyin', now listen how I do it
I get brain from a smart bitch but she stupid
Put an arrow through yo heart but no, I'm not Cupid
Like you shuffle when I shoot, but no, it's not Cupid
The wordplay is so cold, my heart is so gone
Yo bitches so sprung, yeah I put the team on
She gon get the whole team head, call that a crew neck
But I'm wearin' a sweater, I'ma get her wetter
I'm the best to ever do it, I'ma say that shit forever
No matter the weather, knock 'em out like Floyd Mayweather
I'm off the dome kickin' it, that's just how it is
I'm Khalifa with the reefer but I never been a wiz
Tricks are for grownups, they said they were for kids
Hell naw, cause you will get popped off like a zit
If you fuckin' with my money cause I'll all about a grip
Tell yo bitch to swallow kids and I'll tell you to swallow clips
Rest in piss, rest in this, matter of fact, I'ma go hard
Spit crack like Bobby Brown and grill 'em like Bogart
Stomp the yard like Chris Brown like he got shot in the movie
I'm hotter than white bitches chillin' in a jacuzzi
My money got longer, shout out to Uzi
I'm in the scene with a nina, you run up, I'm shootin'
I swear that you don't want no problems with me, it's over with
Call me everything but sober, I am not with that sober shit
It's a union with my gang, comin' round like it's Soviet
Matter of fact, I'm finna gamble for this shit with yo poker chips
If you run up, you will, you will get cranked like Soulja did
I'ma drop bars same way I drop bombs, you ain't on shit
WW-dot-com, I forgot a W, I took that out, that W stand for "Win"
And I never took the losin' route, I always took the losers out
Eeny meeny miney moe, I always pick the choosers out
She got titties, when she come around I pick the hooters out
Run up on me, that's okay, they beefin' with computers now
I'm not worried about these niggas, keep a thirty on my hip
I Steph Curry about these niggas
These niggas hella soft, man I worry about these niggas
I never run away, I don't flurry away from niggas
That nigga lil' pussy, he furry, ain't he, lil' nigga?
Pull up on the scene, you know I'm with it
My windows tinted, pulled up clean with a "Stop, you finished"
You know we did it
I'm ballin' like Dennis Rodman, I'm fuckin' awesome
My bombin' like atomic, my eyes are redder than demonic
I'm faster than sonic, I'm faster, withdrawals got me fastin'
My stomach movin' slow like molasses, I got it
Run up on me, I'm poppin'
Feel like Drake when I'm rappin' cause I start from the bottom
All this shit that I'm talkin', I could probably back it
I slide into yo bitch DM like a sled and toboggan
For yo brains I may bargain, I caught you lackin' that target
I'll turn yo ass to a target then threw yo ass in the garbage
Run up on me, it's nothing, I swear to god that I'm bussin'
Like a Proactiv commercial or somethin'
These niggas makin' assumption, me, I'm just makin' this money
I wear Givenchy, you still in Abercrombie, you see the difference?
Broke niggas and rich niggas, showin' the distance
This is a business relationship, fuck a friendship
All these other niggas fake like "What you got over there?
Let me get something off your plate", nah
I did this all by myself so I don't need nobody's help, shit
I'm a giant, you an elf, I put yo brains up on a shelf after I collect it
Matter of fact, my mind is my weapon
Slide through yo block again and catch some sloppy seconds
That's a preference, I heard you talkin' about heaven
Well I send yo ass to hell, right next to Jezebel
You can catch 20 shells, you a fat person, you get shot, Garfield
I got bars like jail barbells, these niggas not funny, Seinfeld
But my flow is so unpredictable
Fuckin' with me is like steppin' in a minefield
Man, I could never mess up, I gotta fess up, this is a confession
I pull up on the scene with my 40, it came from my plaster
That shit is a blessing, I leave you in the past tense
I rap to wrappin' plastics, that's just some plaster rap
But I'm still the realest rapper after the fact, can you imagine that?
Man, these niggas sick to hell, Johnson couldn't magic that
Man, this rappin' shit is such a passion
Not a father when I did it so I'm callin' me a bastard
And these niggas talkin' dumb to me
But that shit doesn't matter, cause my pockets gettin' fatter
And I'm climbin' like a ladder, outta space, I'm up on Saturn
With some niggas that came from my hometown
They really rowdy, you run up, that's okay
I swear to God we get to growlin' and bouncin' and pouncin'
You gon need a bouncer, we robbin' yo accountant for everything
So much money that I ain't even count yet
Life's a bitch, why is mine keep playin' farfetched
These niggas ain't locked up, haven't seen bars yet
My gun singin' like Barbra, guess, Streisand
I got a knife in my right hand, yo bitch in my left hand
And her meth in my back pocket, I'll give it to her in a second
If she keep jockin', I'll rip your eyes out of your head
If you keep watchin', I am the best rapper in here
The best rapper over there, the best rapper everywhere
I can say what I want and it'll come out how I want it
Run up if you want, that's okay cause it's over
I really do not condone it, I don't fuck with opponents
It's commas, no exponents, but these bullets come in three
And they singin' like Jonas, I don't really got no smoke
But if you want it I got it, I pull it out and I pop it
I send some shots at your noggin, I remember rockin' Robins
Back at the bottom, now it's Givenchy and Gucci
All over my pant pockets, man, maybe I should stop it
Let's keep goin' man, I'm just feelin' nauseous
Off the Henny, that's the remedy
A hundred in these clips so if I shoot it that's a centipede
I stick it on the Lamborghini, drivin' like a century
It's 21 inside the clip, like the century, I'm schoolin' niggas
Ruler and the Glock, elementary, I'm in her mouth like a dentist
She made me replenish, I'm ballin' like I'm Dennis
Rodman, rotten, plottin', freestyle, no jottin', I got it
Man I could rap forever if I go broke Westwood I'ma trap forever
So cold I could go to Siberia and trap the weather
I could trap in Siberia, I could trap wherever
Man, rainy weather, sunny weather, either way, it goes
My gun with me cause it go, oof!
Next beat, next beat, I may come back
Next part, what should I kill? Cool

[Verse 3]
Catch me spittin' on this Kill beat
Hopin' that these niggas would just feel me, the real me
My weapon is concealed and
You know I'm a suspect when I walk into the building
I came to London just to make some noise
The shit I say is for grown men, these bars are not for lil boys
I'm Andy with these toys
You run up on me, you get flexed on like Terry Crews and steroids
Listen, I been ballin' like a Piston
I been marchin' on niggas like I am army enlisted
You run up on me, you get it
My choppa' retarded and spittin' on these goofy ass niggas
Pop a roofie, I'm gone, in a whole nother zone
Put my dick in yo mom, that's the shit that I'm on
Yeah that's the shit that I'm on, you ain't on shit cause you dumb
You run up on me, you gone, that choppa' on me, it's rung
You get hung like a noose
I'm about the war, give a fuck about the truce
All about myself, I give a fuck about you
Matter of fact, I may just shoot the fuck up out you
Put an X next to your name like Malcolm
I guess you didn't weigh your options out, your outcomes
You did the wrong shit on the right day
We turn a white day into a red day
Fuck what yo mom say, fuck what yo' dad say
I keep it 3K like my first name Andre
If I go broke, I'm probably servin' like an entree
In Bombay with yo girl suckin' all on me
Off the Xannies, I'm a zombie
Don't believe me, try me, fuck around, stomp you
I'm kinda hungry off the weed, I may chomp you
And that shorty, she a eater, she a muncher
Man I'm feeling like a monster
Straight Jeffrey Dahmer when I'm grippin' the Llama
You don't want problems, no smoke at all
I take your whole pound and smoke it all
I take yo bitches then fuck 'em all
They on my D, I'm hatin', I duck 'em all
And she look at my whole team then suck 'em all
Macaroni on me, it'll buck-buck 'em all
Man somebody tell me to stop, nah, I'mma keep goin', just watch
I take yo Rollie, yo watch, yo bitches all on my cock
You run up on me, get popped, they judge a nigga like Cochran
They forgot to stop it, run up on me here
I got a rocket on me, no launcher
I feel like I am the bestest, I'm deadlier than asbestos
My word is really my weapon, I'm coming back for some seconds
Freestylin's a preference, send you to stairway to heaven
Man, these niggas writin' the shit that I say
The beats beat when I'm beatin' like Doctor the Dre
I pull up on them with the choppa', and screamin' out "Hey!
Fuck you, pow pow, have a nice day"
And my wrist is like an ice tray, and yo bitch she do what I say
Yeah, she put her hands in the air when my song come on
Like single ladies and Beyonce, yeah
And the way that I spit shit
I burn niggas like Jamaicans with the incense
Been the realest with the shit ever since I was an infant
I'm a misfit, Tony Hawk on my grind like a trip tip, you could get hit
Choppa leave you cryin' like a chick flick, I'm a sick kid
Bitch, I been lit, man these niggas ain't shit but some pussies
And pork ass niggas, fuck is a piglet
Fuck is these niggas, I don't fuck with these niggas
A four-leaf clover on a bullet, good luck with these niggas
Man it must suck for these niggas, ol' sufferin' niggas
YouTube ol' video bufferin' niggas
Ol' big bad wolf huff-puffin' ass niggas
Til I pull up on the scene like "You think you hard?"
I put a bullet hole through your muffin ass, nigga
Man, all the songs that I'm bumpin', I got the partiers jumpin'
You run up on me, it's over, that chopper's on me, it's dumpin'
I'll dump you like a bad relationship, hold on, wait, wait, wait
Let me take this shit, it may take a bit
I spit the shit I say, go back, re-say it
Then say somethin' different, replacin' it, man they hatin' us
It's presidential brain from yo bitch Sarah Palin kid
Still sellin' John McCain, like you got yo shit snatched
My flow is off the chain, pull up in the rover, yeah I got the range
I feel like Drake, nothing was the same
Niggas love to hate, get up out my face before you catch a AK
Shoot him in his face, tell that nigga bye-bye, man down, mayday
Pull up to his mom house and turn it to my safe place
I need a safe haven, I'm too busy slayin'
Dyin' my hair like Super Saiyans, leave his face on the pavement
Jackie Chan when I'm smokin', I really feel like an Asian
Fuck yo bitch when I'm high, call that shit Asian persuasion
I rush out with yo girl, she fuck for hours up in the shower
I feel like I got superpowers, I'm so superb
I'm bout the action, you niggas bout action verbs
I don't gotta say a word, I shoot for the green, feelin' like Larry Bird
On the competition, I drop and take a turd
Shove it in they ears, they hearin' every word
Really though, I get it poppin' like a nigga hittin' wheelies hoe
Or an ollie hoe, or a molly hoe
Run a train on yo bitch, that's a trolley hoe
Don't try me how I do you like Dej Loaf
You want to go to heaven so bad, here's a halo
My gun sing like J Lo, you better get low like limbo
Before you catch a couple shots for yo kinfolk
I'm Rambo with the ammo, I don't never let go
Money kinda stick to me, call me Juice Velcro
Say you gettin' money now, fuck nigga hell no
You don't like Adidas but this choppa give you shell toes
This choppa' give you shell toes
And leave yo ass dancin' on the floor like a red nose
Beam on my gun, that's a red nose
Pull up on the scene, let the shit blow
Yonkers, Yonkers, in this bitch with Westwood, man

[Verse 4]
Yeah, let's do it, oof, got a lil' more bounce to it, don't it?
Uhh uhh, I've been going through a lot as of lately
You can call me crazy
Bitches wanna play me
Really I got blueprints
Feelin' like I'm JAY-Z
My flow in the morning, Westwood no Sway B
That's just how it is, boy
My flow so brazy, my flow so cool
My flow so outdated, so old school
But then nigga switch it up to something so new
These niggas walking around like they bulletproof
'Til the bullets shoot, leave the bullets through his sunroof
Kill his son too
Give a fuck, ohh, give a fuck
Nah, not what I do
I'm the type to pull up on your youth group
With a choppa and a machete, that's fuckin' useful
Matter of fact, here it go
I ain't the same nigga I was a year ago
I feel like Jesus in the studio
I'm spittin' miracles, I'm in that white whip
What you call that shit? A miracle
Fuck yo bitch from the back singing negro spirituals
Got a seal, like fate, like a fuckin' envelope
I ain't dope, I'm anti-dope, word to Travis
You run up, that's okay, you gettin' played like Lenny Kravitz
I never had a father, like I said I'm such a bastard
You run up, uh cool, I'ma let your brain splatter
The bullet rim rattle
I feel like Shaquille in the fourth
Break backboards
How I break her back when I hit it from the back, boy
I'm up to bat, boy, it's out the park like Barry Bonds
You best believe that boy (huh)
I spit crack boy
I spit anything they want
I sell it and make it right back boy
You run up on me you get smacked, boy
You get smacked like a bitch and a pimp running laps boy
I'm running shit like gym class on your bitch ass
Leave you leaking like maxi pads, grab a Tampax
I pull up on 'em with two guns, they attached
Knocked 'em out, ping ping ping, boxing match (uh)
But my flow is unmatched, my flow is outmatched
My flow is so hard, your flow is wack
My flow is so crack, your flow is so mid
My flow is so kill, your flow is so eeeh
I don't got time for it
Suck on my dick, tell your bitch to come over and swallow my kids
Choppa' on my hip I had to hollow my tips
Hallowed be thy name, pray to catch his ass slippin'
Pull up on his ass leave him leakin' I get 'em
Walkin' with a limp .40 heavy like I'm pimpin'
Matter fact I have 'em dancin' when I shoot it crippin'
Niggas talkin' stupid 'til that nigga end up missin'
UFC when I fight 'em I put 'em submission
Hand on a Smith and, I'ma go and get 'em
Stevie Wonder with it, still got 20/20 vision
You can't fuck with me (uh) you can't fuck with me (huh)
I'm like a bad STD bitch you stuck with me (huh)
.40 on my hip I up it on me luckily (huh)
Rushin' hours, like I said got Chrissie Tuck with me (aye)
Couple niggas that's bound to not give a fuck with me (huh)
Just in case these other niggas try fuck with me (uh)
Kept my wits about me luckily, you know I'm smart (uh)
I've been flying through the air I feel like Bonaparte (uh)
Keep two bitches in my circle like I'm Noah's Arc (uh)
Fuck with me I up that choppa' tear your bones apart (uh)
Felt my grove on this track now I'm goin' (huh)
In too deep with this rap shit the ocean (uh)
I'm a flow of the purple, the potion (uh)
I'ma catch me a op in the open (uh)
I make this shit look easy while you strugglin'
I'm ballin' triple doublin' while you doublin'
I exposed like shrooms get it? I be truffilin'
It's Terry Crews with this shit you know I'm musclin'
Watchin' Regular Show laughin' at Muscle Man
Chip on my shoulder it's lookin' like a Pringles can
Desert Eagle on my hip, I'm not a Eagles fan
You know I'm from Chicago they my people man (yeah)
Try me if you wanna
I'll smoke you like a backwood full of marijuana
Matter fact you run up on me you don't want no drama
I'ma leave you scratched like a DJ after DJ Drama touched it
I don't give a fuck, I'm on my fucked shit

I turn my bucket list into a fuckin' fuck it list
So when I kill I walk away like fuck it, shit

Pullin' up in the Chrysler like John Dillinger
Rich as fuck like, "Damn, is you drug dealin' bitch?"
Nah, I'm rappin, used to be trappin'

Takin' craps on all these niggas takin' naps on me
They was sleepin'
Westwood they was sleepin'
Couldn't believe 'em
Now I'm the type to beat the beat up 'til it's bleedin'
Choke it out 'til the mutha' fuckers barely breathin'
They ain't know a rockstar could rap like this
I'ma MC off the High-Tech mixed with High-C
You don't want that
Shoot you in your stomach that shit hard to digest
Make a art project out the projects
Shoot you in your eyes put the shit in prospect
Lookin' at your mindset, I'm beyond that

Niggas beefin' all over computers
Until I catch 'em lackin' in my city
Beat him in his head until he catch a tumour
Tell his momma that I did it, she confused
"Why my baby all over the fuckin' news?"
"What the fuck my baby went and fuckin' did?"
He prolly' went and fucked with Juice The Kid
Thats my old name, now it's Juice WRLD
Went to a different planet
Now I'm up in two worlds
Fuck that shit I'm up in two girls
Diamonds and pearls, I'm ruling the world
Revenge on my body bitch cause thats my state of mind
Stevie Wonder like I said before cause I'ma rob you blind
I got all these answers that these niggas search to find
And they bitches kinda bad I'ma have to get behind
Hit it from the back until I fuckin' break her spine
After that I may just have to go and take whats mine
Yeah yeah turn on that Mob Deep shit

[Verse 5]
Uhuh uh uhuh uh oh
Ain't no such thing as half way
Ain't no such thing as half way
Ain't no such thing as half way gangsters
You in them hallways, you ain't in the streets
Niggas really thinking that it's cool to make beef
And become enemies of enemies
How come all of my enemies was friends to me
How come all my enemies is frienemies
How come all my enemies is blind
I catch 'em lackin' and kill 'em before I read all they energy
I guess that's my energy
I don't know whats gotten' into me
I'm kinda fucked up, well at least mentally
Physically I'm richer than a bitch, who I'm meant to be
I'm up in London gettin' in bustin'
Head like concussion
Run up that's okay I swear to god that its nothin'

She say the syrup in these pills finna kill me
But sometimes I think it brings out the real me
Sometimes I think it brings out the concealed me
Sometimes I think it exposes and reveals me
So what happens when the real meets the real
What happens when Juice meets the pills
Uh-uh-uh, yeah
Westwood shit
I'm up in London
Gettin' it bussin'
Ain't no disscusion, run up on me then I'm drummin'
My choppa sick or something
Like it was drunk I up it it'd start to vomit (ooh)
That's a bar
Lookin' at my watch like that's a star (huh)
Lookin' at my spaceship like that's a car (huh)
Lookin' at my pills, them Xanny bars, nah
In 2016 I was poppin' them Xannies
Now I'm in Percies
Lastin' forever in [? 59:54]
Run up on me goin' harder than granny
Sit down muhfucker 'cause I know you can't stand it
Outlandish, I'm gorilla in the mesh
You just a Kung Fu Panda
I ain't sippin' clean nothin', this some dirty Fanta
With a bitch on my lap like my first name Santa
You get jacked like a pumpkin, no O'Lantern, uh
VVS on my ring like the Green Lantern you gon' kiss it like a Mafia king
I'm a boss, that's a Mafia thing
808 my chopper that's a Mafia thing, yeah, uh
Yeah, I did it
Mom, I made it
From goin' to physics class, to
Tourin' the world, shittin' on everybody, the world is my potty
I'm shitting on every possy
And I don't even got a team like that
I aim with my eye, I don't need a beam like that
Run up on me, choppa make you sing like that
Make you march like Martin Luther King, in fact
I'm blacked, and excellent
I'm shittin' on these niggas, this is a excrement
I rapped on another beat that's some extra shit
You niggas gon' have to deal with the mess of it
I thought I told yo' ass not to mess wit' it
I see this shit before I say it, telepathy
It's like I talk to my conscious, I say what it's tellin' me
Anything besides money, eh, it's kinda irrelevant
I can't focus without codeine, my medicine
I sip it until I'm slurrin' and spittin' impediments
I'm ballin' to the point where I think I need a Letterman
Westwood at the gates of London, he just had to let 'em in
I'm here, spazzin' on every single track he pass
You run up, I leave you leakin' on a maxipad
I'm ballin', hard, these other niggas on the bench
I swear, they need to stay where they at
Nigga, I'm takin' over the world, a map for a map
I'm off of a ecstasy pill, that's a flat for a flat
I'm up to bat, throw a fastball, it's a hit
I hit a lick, then I hit a hit on yo' bitch I don't miss
Listen, I heard yo' bitch on my hitlist
I hit that bitch, then I'm dippin'
You run up on me, I'm shootin'
That choppa on me is spittin'
My wordplay is amazing
My flow is so brazy (huh)
I'm shakin' shit up like I said, no Haiti
This is freestyle shit, it's authentic
My flow, it burns niggas
Careers is arsenic (uh)
My flow badder than bad women
I rock shows like Kravitz and John Lennon
Yo' sins ain't forgivin'
I'm the rap god, call me Juice Allah
Did I take it too far?
Did I take two bars, to get on Mars?
To more like [? 1:02:28] (hold on)
I got a little tongue twisted, but I'm still gifted
Still spittin', still rippin' writtens
This premonition is really killin' it
And these niggas ain't shit
But Civics, me I'm Bentley
Get it, bitch
Don't you forget it
The shit that you talking, I really lived it (uh)
I sold my soul then bought it back, I finessed 'em (uh)
You run up on me, choppa holy it'll bless 'em (uh)
He talking stupid 'till they shoot him, that's my weapon (uh)
I got a couple of bars I could spit
Maybe I'll just use 'em in this shit
Or maybe I'll just use 'em in a skit
My first guess, they wanted shit
My next project, it's gon' be harder
My arm in the rim, really, I feel like Vince Carter
I'm at yo' head nigga, I feel like a barber
You on the bench nigga, and I am a starter
I die for my shit nigga, feel like I'm a martyr
My shit's off the charts
You run up, that's okay you catch a hole to your heart
I put that on my life, and that shit come from the heart
I'm freestyling on live, that's how it is
Yo' bitch swallow the kids
She up in my crib, I'm tellin' you how it is
Man, this rap shit serious like XM (huh)
I ex them (huh)
I fuck the bitch that he's next to (uh)
She hangin' out, fuck her curfew (uh)
You my son, lil' nigga I birthed you
But I shine, like the pair of them church shoes
I ain't been to church in a long time, 'cause they all lies
All the legends, where they at? They all die
Well, I don't wanna be a legend up in my prime
But, I know it's still prime time
Stars, how I shine
When they align with the planet, you know some shit is goin' on
I transform like Omegatron, when my favourite song is on
Fuckin' that bitch like the Ramadan
Man, I spit shit
So cool
I breakdance shit like the old school
I'm never runnin' out of energy, I'm a suspect grippin' this [? 1:04:35] vicinity
Try me if you want, 'cause I swear it's not gon' end cool
I'ma prolly pull up to your cruel like, "Where the fuck is you"
Cock it back and then I shoot
W-W-W, I can't lose
Ayy, I flew from London to Chicago
Money in my pockets, I may get a Murciélago
That's all that I know
Shout out to my kinfolk, they know I'm totin' ammo
In the streets they call me Rambo, ain't no peace where I'm from
But these pieces, we tote 'em, you run up on me it's over
Like a cig, we gon' smoke 'em
I put yo' ass in a coma
Smokin' kush, this aroma, leave yo' ass in a coma
Ballin' out like I'm Odom before the crack, don't you get it?
Spittin' crack on these niggas, define niggas like physics
Shut the fuck up and listen, I'm ballin' hard like a Piston
Nigga this shit's enlisted just like a army lil' nigga
I swear to god I'm invincible you can't harm me lil' nigga, yeah
I'm talkin' to you
I sent you my address a couple weeks ago, you ain't come through
'Cause you know we was gon' leave yo' ass dropped like a sunroof on a new coupe
Haha, I talk a lotta shit
But it all means something
