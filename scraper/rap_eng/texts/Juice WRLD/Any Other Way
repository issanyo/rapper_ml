[Chorus]
Wouldn't have it any other way
Wake up gettin' money every day
Remember writin' raps in my basement
Now I'm up in Cali, every day a vacation
Still takin' drugs to the face
Pills full of thrills, take your sufferin' away
Rob your connection, you buff for a day
I bet you'd kill to be me for a day

[Verse 1]
Take one perc, 3-0 to the face
Scratch my problems away
Callin' up the gang, is it a problem today
They don't catch feelings, but they'll catch them a case
Took your bitch to Cali, you take L's in LA
I just want the Rolly, with the diamonds in the face
Glizzy and the Goyard, [?] on my waist
Wear it around my neck so I look pretty when I spray
I put codeine [?], money gangster, pourin' up
If I tell him you a problem, he gon' fuck you up
He told me nothing gettin' between us and these fuckin' bucks
We gon' run it up, we gon' run it up
So much cash, we gon' need a dump truck
Tryna rob me, you such a dumb fuck
That bitch say she love me, she such a dumb slut
Say he wanna kill me, lil nigga what's up?

[Chorus]
Wouldn't have it any other way
Wake up gettin' money every day
Remember writin' raps in my basement
Now I'm up in Cali, every day a vacation
Still takin' drugs to the face
Pills full of thrills, take your sufferin' away
Rob your connection, you buff for a day
I bet you'd kill to be me for a day

[Verse 2]
You'll probably kill me if you had the chance, huh
Probably cause I spent a couple thou on pants, huh
Probably cause I got your bitch to dirty dance, huh
Fuck her then I'll leave her, call me Dirty Dan, huh
She scratch her head, like she got dandruff
You is my son, like my name Sanford
Hatin' niggas turn me into Bruce Banners
I ain't Megaman, but I got two cannons
Keep a few cannons
Soundin' like a drumline, nigga, Nick Cannon
Said she had fun time, cocaine dancin'
She wanna go to hell tonight, Marilyn Manson
Marilyn Monroe, I fuck on a white hoe

[Chorus]
Wouldn't have it any other way
Wake up gettin' money every day
Remember writin' raps in my basement
Now I'm up in Cali, every day a vacation
Still takin' drugs to the face
Pills full of thrills, take your sufferin' away
Rob your connection, you buff for a day
I bet you'd kill to be me for a day
