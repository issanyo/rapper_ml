[Intro]
Eh-eh
Yeah-eh
Humans ain't made for this shit
Yeah uh
Carti made it in the stu


[Chorus]
Humans ain’t made for this shit
Why is our society like this
You know that the pressure on me, enormous
Everyday we fight, but we wanna forfeit
I don't wanna wake up sometimes
I don't wanna make up my mind
Why do we live just to die
Do we just live to survive
Money, pussy, power
Money, pussy, power
Money, pussy, power
Money, pussy, power
Money, pussy, power
Money, pussy, power
Be the only things that they want us for


[Verse 1]
We were born in the world
That’s when we had the most bless
Thought you could be fucking rich if you focus
Spent your first 52 years so focused
That you didn't notice you drive a Ford Focus
Rich mother fuckers don't get rich following the sandstorm
But we only give a fuck about money 'cause we part of the system
(5-4-3-2-1 ignition sequence start)
If aliens come look up on this earth
They'd probably go back
They'd rather live with dinosaurs
TBT thrwback
Cause people laying shit
I swear that's just human nature
I called her a bitch 'cause she only wants the paper
I would do anything just so I can save her
Just so she can break my heart a couple months later


[Chorus]
Humans ain’t made for this shit
Why is our society like this
You know that the pressure on me, enormous
Everyday we fight, but we wanna forfeit
I don’t wanna wake up sometimes
I don't wanna make up my mind
Why do we live just to die
Do we just live to survive
Money, pussy, power
Money, pussy, power
Money, pussy, power
Money, pussy, power
Money, pussy, power
Money, pussy, power
Be the only things that they want us for


[Verse 2]
Fuck everything that be holding me back
Because life about time that we don’t have much of that
But my whole life a lie I can not trust a fact
Because everything true is eventually bad
Woke up, wanna throw up before I pull up
Roll up, gotta relax and get my gold up
People used to put me down, now watch my glo up
Now they pay the premium to see me show up
There's a galaxy in those eyes
The whole universe in your mind
You'll be worry one in no time
In front of you is a whole life
(Back in 1970 the middle class encounter
For sixty three percent of average house income
Today the middle class encounter
For just forty three percent
Yet more proof the regonomics is socially rich)


[Chorus]
Humans ain't made for this shit
Why is our society like this
You know that the pressure on me, enormous
Everyday we fight, but we wanna forfeit
I don’t wanna wake up sometimes
I don't wanna make up my mind
Why do we live just to die
Do we just live to survive
