[Chorus]
Heartbreak
That shit hit me in the face
Told me that you loved me then you went and changed your ways
Feel like it's been months, you ain't talked to me in days
"Move on", that's what everybody say
Ha, easier said than done
I thought you were the one
The way that you loved me, girl I'll never forget
You're onto new things
And I can't be choosey
It's all in my head
Heartbreak
That shit hit me in the face
Told me that you loved me then you went and changed your ways
Better off dead, yeah I'm counting down the days
"Move on", that's what everybody say
Ha, easier said than done
I thought you were the one
The way that you loved me, girl I'll never forget
You're onto new things
And I can't be choosey
It's all in my head

[Verse]
Days of the future, so close man they looked great
Now my heart is split in half
I had a smile on my face like everyday
Now you just sit back and laugh
Can you call, I really need you
All these fucking tears baby, I just wanna see you
Tell me it's okay and I try to believe you
I take prescription to make me feel less blue
Can't say I hate you
But I can't replace you
Glimpses of hope in my head
You were my everything
For you, I'd do anything
Let's just be real I love you more than myself
Now I'll just wait and frown
For you to come back around
Baby come back to me, I know you need help
This is depression
I feel obsession
When you were here I didn't think of myself
Gave you my heart you don't care

[Bridge]
Say you need time alone
Girl I just don't condone
But hey, whatever you say
Now all I feel is rain
Running right through my pain
Everywhere I am it's grey

[Chorus]
Heartbreak
That shit hit me in the face
Told me that you loved me then you went and changed your ways
Feel like it's been months, you ain't talked to me in days
"Move on", that's what everybody say
Ha, easier said than done
I thought you were the one
The way that you loved me, girl I'll never forget
You're onto new things
And I can't be choosey
It's all in my head
Heartbreak
That shit hit me in the face
Told me that you loved me then you went and changed your ways
Better off dead, yeah I'm counting down the days
"Move on", that's what everybody say
Ha, easier said than done
I thought you were the one
The way that you loved me, girl I'll never forget
You're onto new things
And I can't be choosey
It's all in my head
