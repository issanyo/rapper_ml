I go so hard, I go so hard
I'm a rockstar, my brother with that stick talk
We don't say shit at all we don't like that shit talk
Ain't no off days at all but we get them bricks off
I sip wockhardt with the moonrock
In that Bentley truck, yes I feel exotic
Your shit ain't there yet, put some drip on it
I take you whole check, and than I shit on it

[Verse 1: Juice Wrld]
Rollie white as fuck like I just put a brick on it
Your Rollie fake as fuck boy you can hear the tick on it
The way she sucked me up I thought it was a tick on me
I get the money than I split it with my big homies
You show your man off that nigga ain't got shit on me
My clothing like my state of mind I got Revenge on me
F&N on me thats a sick homie
Not big enough my shit will smoke you like a cig homie
I bought a couple Gucci coats cause it's a cold world
I dropped the pill in the lean watch it fizz on me
Ain't enough love for me in the whole world
My apologies my heart be getting big on me

[Hook: Juice Wrld]
I go so hard, I go so hard
I'm a rockstar, my brother with that stick talk
We don't say shit at all we don't like that shit talk
Ain't no off days at all but we get them bricks off

In that Bentley truck, yes I feel exotic
Your shit ain't there yet, put some drip on it
I take you whole check, and than I shit on it

[Verse 1: Juice Wrld]
Sip so much everyone think I'm gon' die on em'
I put my heart into this shit like I just cried on it
My brother flippin' in his grave there's niggas lyin' on him
His homies wasn't ever my homies
Niggas get to shootin' like they Prigioni
I get lean straight from Houston, that's the Whitney on me
You see that bag round my neck, that's the semi on me
If I got a backpack it's probably cause it's a titty on it
I spent ten-racks all on shoes, hella kicks on me
It make me feel some type of way, like my name Rich Homie
New Balenciaga's on me I bought two pairs
They ain't runners but you niggas know I'm still runnin'

[Hook: Juice Wrld]
I go so hard, I go so hard
I'm a rockstar, my brother with that stick talk
We don't say shit at all we don't like that shit talk
Ain't no off days at all but we get them bricks off

In that Bentley truck, yes I feel exotic
Your shit ain't there yet, put some drip on it
I take you whole check, and than I shit on it
