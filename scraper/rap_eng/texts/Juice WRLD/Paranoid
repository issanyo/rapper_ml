[Intro]
Listen this shit really has me thinking man
Fuck, fuck

[Chorus]
Just another day without you
I can't go a day without you
Cocaine all on the counter
Remember you in love with the powder
Just another day without you
I can't go a day without you
Still xanax all on the counter
Remember I'm in love with the downers

[Verse]
You can stay or you can leave
I just wanna lock you out and throw away the key
I just wanna lock you out and throw away the key
I just wanna lock you out
Hold on wait a second
You've been providing me depression
You've been abusing your position
Using your words as a weapon
You got me paranoid of other women
I'm knowing you got a ploy
You on a mission, you wanna see me destroyed
Oh no, you play with me like I'm a toy
Oh no, and I can't take it anymore
So you gotta leave
Now I gotta lock you out and throw away the key
Now I gotta lock you out and throw away the key
Now I gotta lock you out

[Chorus]
Just another day without you
I can't go a day without you
Still cocaine all on the counter
You got me in love with the powder
Just another day without you
I can't go a day without you
Still xanax all on the counter
Remember I'm in love with the downers
Downers, downers
