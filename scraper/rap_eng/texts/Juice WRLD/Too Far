[Intro]
I took it too far, I took it too far (too far)

[Chorus]
I took you too far, she was my getaway broad
I need a getaway car, I need to get away far
'Cause I took you too far, she was my getaway broad
I need a getaway car, I need to get away far

[Verse 1]
I'm taking two bars, now I am on mars
I took you too far, I'm taking your heart
You don't play your part, you don't play your part
No, I don't play fair, but I still play hard
(I took you too far, I took you too far, you don't play your part)

[Chorus]
I took you too far, she was my getaway broad
I need a getaway car, to get away far
I took you too far, she was my getaway broad
I need a getaway car, to get away far

[Verse 2]
I took you too far to where ever you are
Where ever you are, don't take it too far
I've been going to hard, tryna get yo attention
I know that you feel relentless
I've been feeling restless, 'cause I took it too far
To where ever you are
