[Hook]
I'm high, and I'm nauseous
Oops, I meant obnoxious
These hoes flockin'
These niggas watchin'
Runnin' outta options'
Gettin' outta pocket
These hoes watchin'
These niggas flockin'
Runnin' outta options
Gettin' outta pocket
These hoes watchin'
These niggas flockin'
Runnin' outta options
Gettin' outta pocket

[Verse 1]
I see fake shit almost every day
Choppa get the beats like Dr. Dre
Drunk off percocets, and aliz√©
I get high, so I feel numb, so it's okay
My problems is dead, but I just run away
Xanny my umbrella, for a rainy day
These niggas ain't straight, look like gay parade
Choppa got a gold tip like Flava Flav
Member I ain't had no gun, I used the razor blade
It was still a drill, when I came around, I feel like Major Pain
Prince up in that double cup, I been sippin' purple rain
I be throwin' hands and throwin' bands, never throwin' shade

[Hook]
These hoes watchin'
Runnin' outta options
Gettin' outta pocket
These hoes watchin'
These niggas flockin'
Runnin' outta options, yuh, one take gang

[Verse 2]
Runnin' outta options, I was given too many
I save all my money, I'm not spendin' a penny
Boy I'm lyin', I just spent 2 thousand up in Supreme
Over shit I don't wear, I don't fuck with them jeans
I still bought em, cause I couldn't remember when I couldn't
Wish a nigga would, I never wish a nigga wouldn't
Run up on me, no he shouldn't
Oh no, no he shouldn't
Pull up on him with that choppa, like oh no he didn't
Pull up on him, with my room, you know that shit was missin'
UFC, he wanna fight, my fist put him in submission
I don't fuck with pussies, but I still beat up the kitten
He was totin' a Taurus, nigga I was totin' a smithon

[Hook]
Watchin', these hoes watchin'
Runnin' outta options
Gettin' outta pocket
These hoes flockin'
These niggas flockin'
Runnin' outta options
Gettin' outta pocket

[Verse 3]
Freestyle the whole song, I don't even care
You unaware that your bitch over here in her underwear
That VVS on my wrist is lookin' like a Solar Flare
My choppa like a home run, get that nigga outta here
Goin', goin', gone
Transform to a car, like Megatron
Fuck yo bitch, I glow up in the dark, I feel like Tron
I choose you, she come and suck my ball like Pokemon
Call of Duty, with that choppa, watch how all my niggas spawn
Cal me Juice Osam, walkin' and I'm flyer than that bomb

[Outro]
Uh, huh
These hoes flockin'
Runnin' outta options
