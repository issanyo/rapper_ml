[Intro: Juice WRLD]
808 Mafia
Uh, uh
In your room, playin' 'round fair
I ain't never playin' fair, never playin' fair
Seph got the waves
I ain't never playin', uh, yeah
YK

[Chorus: Juice WRLD]
I ain't never playin' fair, never playin' fair
My heart never been a playground, don’t play there
I ain't never playin' fair, never playin' fair
My heart never been a playground, don’t play there, uh
Lookin’ at your face, tryna not act scared
I can’t take no more of the pain, baby, don’t you dare
I was thinkin’ we should play a game, truth or dare
Is it true that you may be a real one? No dare

[Verse 1: Juice WRLD]
I pray to god that I don't feel numb
Really gettin' tired of lookin' dumb
Breaking hearts ain't that fun
Especially if you're the one
I can see the devil on your tongue, tongue, tongue
It's got an illusion of the damage done
I always base my future on the past, it's wrong
Can't help it, I know it ain't healthy
Icebox as a heart, shorty got it meltin'
Cupid got the shooter, swish, swish, uh, Raymond Felton
Hope the hammer goes down, yeah, I already nailed it
Had to sink the ship here before it started sailin'
Rain comes down, then it'll get to hailin'
Smokin' heart, like loud, yeah, I inhaled it
Shot Cupid down, hit him in the belly
Got his blood all over my Burberrys

[Chorus: Juice WRLD]
I ain't never playin' fair, never playin' fair
My heart never been a playground, don’t play there
I ain't never playin' fair, never playin' fair
My heart never been a playground, don’t play there, uh
Lookin’ at your face, tryna not act scared
I can’t take no more of the pain, baby, don’t you dare
I was thinkin’ we should play a game, truth or dare
Is it true that you may be a real one? No dare

[Verse 2: Tracy]
Yeah, keep my heart in your Fendi purse (Fendi purse)
Diamonds are forever, rock my chains in a hearse
I hate myself but I really love her
You know we stay fly, guess we're really love-birds
It’s the way you say my name, yeah, I really like that (like that)
I want this for life and I’ma die by that (die by that)
Touchin’ on her like I touch my racks (racks)
Playin’ with my heart, baby, don’t do that
Ooh, I don’t play fair, baby, I could do that too
I swear, my other bitch look just as good as you
But I could never love her, I could never trust her
I could only fuck her (I could only fuck her)
I been sippin’ on this red wine (red wine)
Wondering when I'll die
I ain't playin' fair, no, I ain't playin' fair
But if you go to hell, baby, I'ma be there (be there)
