[Intro]
So alone
Count the money while my lonely (Money while my lonely)
I ain't really fucking with the police (I ain't really fucking with the police)
And you know I keep it on me (And you know I keep it on me)
I ain't really fucking with the-
I ain't really fucking with the po-lice
Enviyon on the mix

[Chorus]
She told me she in love with the old me
But I don't love the old me
In the fourth quarter balling like Kobe
I'm super clutch just like Gin贸bili
Time is money so I went and got a rollie
New girl looking like a trophy
She do the cocaine till her nose bleed (Nose bleed, nose bleed)
And she don't even know me

[Verse 1]
I've been balling while you sitting in the nose bleeds
911, I don't fuck with police
Niggas claim they know me when they don't know me
Say you a real nigga, better show me
I don't fuck with no one (Aye)
Brother locked up, told you that's that Akon
I got AKs spilling like I'm Osam, aye
Pop a xan then I forgot, aye
I forgot to remember her name
Life is a picture I guess I got my hand in the frame (Hand in the frame)
I forgot to remember her name
Life is a picture and I got all my hands in the frame

[Chorus]
She told me she in love with the old me
But I don't love the old me
In the fourth quarter balling like Kobe
I'm super clutch just like Gin贸bili
Time is money so I went and got a rollie
New girl looking like a trophy
She do the cocaine till her nose bleed (Nose bleed, nose bleed)
And she don't even know me (And she don't know me, know me)

[Verse 2]
They sing the right songs they just hit the wrong notes
Remember old days when I had my heart broke
And now I'm in the stu and I love to spit dope
Brought brother in the trap and he love to fix dope
These niggas never change I could never fix broke (Fix broke)
I run up on his ass, get the shooter Rambo (Rambo)
I know some niggas brazy, they run like Elmo (Like Elmo)
I'm sticking to the money like I got velcro
You say you getting money but I know it's hell no
You don't got no Adidas but I give you shell toes
I'm balling like Shaquille Imma throw an elbow
You don't get no birds like a fucking scarecrow

[Chorus]
She told me she in love with the old me
But I don't love the old me
In the fourth quarter balling like Kobe
I'm super clutch just like Gin贸bili
Time is money so I went and got a rollie
New girl looking like a trophy
She do the cocaine till her nose bleed (Nose bleed, nose bleed)
And she don't even know me (And she don't even know me, know me)


[Outro]
I don't love the old me
Balling like Kobe
Gin贸bili
