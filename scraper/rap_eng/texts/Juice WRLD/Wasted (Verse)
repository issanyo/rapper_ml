[CB on the beat, ho]
[This is the R-r-r-r-r-r-remix]

[Chorus: Juice WRLD & Maybel Montez]
Wasted, GTA love, bitches wasted
Wasted, I'm on these drugs, I feel wasted
Wasted, get her off my mind when I'm wasted
Wasted, I waste all my time when I'm wasted
Wasted, GTA love, bitches wasted (Wasted)
Wasted, I'm on these drugs, I feel wasted
Wasted, get her off my mind when I'm wasted
Wasted, I waste all my time when I'm wasted
Wasted

[Verse: Maybel Montez]
I feel so wasted
All my bitches famous
Silenced like the Masons, public information
So many vacations, I know that I'm on it
But I noticed that you want it
I'm just honest, so one hundred, yeah
Don't ever get caught on the way in
Cos I can tell you that they instigation
Know them niggas haten let's just face it
And I don't wanna have to spray
88 verses with catch phrases, you ain't relating
I get it, I got it I got it I get it
I'm making business decisions
I'm in it to win it like minute to win it
You gotta admit it
All of my lyrics make bitches go take they clothes off
From my old songs
And still they scream "Maybel Wright" like I don't know wrong
"Because of you" gotta keep getting it
I feel like I have been losing my patience
"And Then There Were 2"
And "Discovery Cove" is still in the making, right now I am

[Chorus: Juice WRLD & Maybel Montez]
Wasted, GTA love, bitches wasted
Wasted, I'm on these drugs, I feel wasted
Wasted, get her off my mind when I'm wasted
Wasted, I waste all my time when I'm wasted
Wasted, GTA love, bitches wasted
Wasted, I'm on these drugs, I feel wasted
Wasted, get her off my mind when I'm wasted
Wasted, I waste all my time when I'm wasted
Wasted
