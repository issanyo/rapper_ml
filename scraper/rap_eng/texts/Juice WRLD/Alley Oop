[Intro: Wolfkendrick & Juice WRLD]
Aye Juice
Let these niggas know what the fuck going on
Alley Oop, Wolfie Woo
Uh, Huh

[Chrous 1: Juice WRLD]
Sip on 44's tipping with a bad hoe
Full of shit ass niggas I'm an asshole
On the scene with my 40 with my cash flow
Throw a band she gone drop that ass low
Told that bitch to ride my dick just like a lasso
I was taught to let live than to let go
I was taught to pull up with the shell toes
I'm the cut Shaquille O'Neil doing them elbows yea

[Verse 1: Wolfkendrick]
Sipping straight drop
Pouring 44's
That lil bitch she wanna fuck me for my cash flow
Silence with the Glock
Tipping on my toes
Busting niggas in the kitchen just to move dope
Alley Oop
Ducking in the booth
Shoot at me my nigga icy busting through your room
Working hitech
Mix it with the wock
It's amazing how a feature make the panties drop
Alley Oop
Wolfie Woo
Got her screaming wolfie all night in the back room
Now I'm in the booth
Her room smell like (inaudible)
Me and Juice are bad boys what you gonna do

[Chrous 2: Juice WRLD]
Sip on 44's tipping with a bad hoe
Full of shit ass niggas I'm an asshole
On the scene with my 40 with my cash flow
Throw a band she gone drop that ass low
Told that to ride my dick just like a lasso
I was taught to let live than to let go
I was taught to pull up with the shell toes
I'm the cut Shaquille O'Neil doing them elbows yea
