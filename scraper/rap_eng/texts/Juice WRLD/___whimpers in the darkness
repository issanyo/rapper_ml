[Intro: KILL.ZERO]
Yuh!

[Hook: KILL.ZERO]
I can hear the whimpers in the darkness
Lyin' to me tellin' me I'm flawless
Promisin' this shit is very harmless
All my feelings dead, I need to save the heartless
Voices makin' me the main target

[Verse 1: KILL.ZERO]
I just popped two now I'm off it
I'm not livin' I just sprang up from a coffin
Spirits brought me down to Austin
Speak of diamonds and the flossing
I might skrt skrt in an Aston
I might wife a Toni Braxton
Bitches diggin' cause they want the latest fashion
I might kill because I'm heartless
You know KILL is heartless

[Hook: KILL.ZERO]
I can hear the whimpers in the darkness
Lyin' to me tellin' me I'm flawless
Promisin' this shit is very harmless
All my feelings dead, I need to save the heartless
Voices makin' me the main target

[Verse 2: Juice WRLD]
I told her I don't start
She don't know about the voices in the dark
Everyday I take a walk through the park
Dead bodies bury them in my yard
I been fuckin' bitches, I been pulling cards!
I've been doin' drugs, I've been goin' hard
I just sold my soul for a couple Ms (uh)
Found out that shit like 5 PM (ayy)
Then I drunk another 5Energy
Mix it with the xannies and the perkies that's some symmetry (ayy)
Voices in the dark (uh)
Back of the bus nigga no Rosa Parks (uh)
Two hoes at a time nigga no Noah's Ark (yuh)
I tear you apart (yuh ayy uh)
I'm a dog, bitch watch me bark (yuh ayy)
I'ma march n' shit like a sergeant (yuh ayy)
Only one of me, fuck a squadron (yuh ayy)
Feeling like a god, let's be honest
Fly without tryin'
That's autopilot (yuh)
I can see the voices in dark (yuh uh ayy)
She can see the poison in my heart (ayy yuh)
Cupid aimin' at me with a dart (ayy uh ayy)
Dumb bitch (uh) don't start (yuh ayy ayy)
Fuck this (uh) I'm out

[Hook: KILL.ZERO]
I can hear the whimpers in the darkness
Lyin' to me tellin' me I'm flawless
Promisin' this shit is very harmless
All my feelings dead, I need to save the heartless
Voices makin' me the main target

[Outro: KILL.ZERO]
Lyin' to me tellin' me I'm flawless
Promisin' this shit is very harmless
All my feelings dead, I need to save the heartless
Voices makin' me the main target
