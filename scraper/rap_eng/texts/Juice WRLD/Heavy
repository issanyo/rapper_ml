[intro]
Uh Huh, yeah

[Juice Wrld : Hook]
Sip on 44's, tipping with a bad hoe
Full of shit ass niggas i'm an asshole
On the scene with my 40 with my cash flow
Throw a band she gon' drop that ass low
Told that bitch to ride my dick jus' like a lasso
I was taught to let live then to let it go
I was taught to pull up with the shell toes
Im the clutch Shaquille O'Neal doin' them elbow's

[Dontello : Verse 1]
Yeah this shit feelin' heavy just gotta take it slow
This my new shit you ain't ready, fornication bitch you cold
You told me you loved me i was on the same note
Broke my heart, left me to drown but I stay afloat
Yeah, just copped me a rollie then i bust it down cold
I gave my soul to you, but then you crush it down to coal
Watch me burn in flames bitch you evil, where's your soul
How long does this last, I can't take this any more
(Yeah this shit feelin' heavy just gotta take it slow
This my new shit you ain't ready, fornication bitch you cold
You told me you loved me i was on the same note
Broke my heart, left me to drown but I stay afloat
Yeah)

Yeah, you was my girl my right hand (ayy)
But you was fake, i don't like that (yeah)
The love that i gave you, can't take back (no)
And now i'm up so you talks back
Basic hoe i ain't gonna take that shit no more
Nah bitch yeah we over and im just walkin' out the door
No i dont want your sorry's now bitch i know that you cold
Pour me up another bottle this bitch got me feeling low
