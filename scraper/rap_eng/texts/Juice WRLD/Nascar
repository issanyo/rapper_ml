[Chorus: Juice WRLD]
Yeah she take off like a NASCAR
GTR, full throttle that's a fast car
Make a movie with your shorty she a pornstar
I forgot it in the morning, I love Xan' bars
Woah, takin' off like a NASCAR
GTR, full throttle that's a fast car
Made a movie with your shorty she a pornstar
I'll forget it by the morning, I love Xan' bars

[Verse 1: Juice WRLD]
Yeah my heart hurts and the pain feels bad
But the drugs work, so I can't feel that
In the trap house, got her voice in my head
Tryna whip bricks out but her voice in my head, hey
Now the drugs don't work and my plug won't pick up
Rob a nigga 'cause I'm mad "Bitch, it's a stick-up"
I've been takin' love with the lean that's a lix-up
Xanax, only take it with the liquor

[Chorus: Juice WRLD]
Yeah she take off like a NASCAR
GTR, full throttle that's a fast car
Make a movie with your shorty she a pornstar
I forgot it in the morning, I love Xan' bars
Woah, takin' off like a NASCAR
GTR, full throttle that's a fast car
Made a movie with your shorty she a pornstar
I'll forget it by the morning, I love Xan' bars

[Verse 2: Lil Durk]
I'm off a Xan, I'm off the lean, ya bitch i'm geakin', ey
I am the man, the fuck is you sayin', these bitches tweakin', ey
Niggas be mad, my bitch is bad, your bitch is decent, ey
You disrespect, my niggas black, these niggas leakin', ey
I heard bro don't got the drugs, I want all of those
Shorty mad, I won't call her, I don't call no hoes
Blow this TEC, niggas test, i'm on under row
I got bands in my pants, with a lot of post

[Chorus: Juice WRLD]
Yeah she take off like a NASCAR
GTR, full throttle that's a fast car
Make a movie with your shorty she a pornstar
I forgot it in the morning, I love Xan' bars
Woah, takin' off like a NASCAR
GTR, full throttle that's a fast car
Made a movie with your shorty she a pornstar
I'll forget it by the morning, I love Xan' bars
