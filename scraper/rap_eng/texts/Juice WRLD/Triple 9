[Intro]
Bitch it's triple 9

[Chorus]
Rolly on me triple time
Bitch I'm triple 9
Light it up like Alkaline
She can feel the vibe, see it when I'm in her eyes
When I'm lookin in her eyes, yeah they hypnotize
Yeah my rolly triple time
Bitch Im' triple nine
Light it up like Alkaline
She can feel the vibe, see it when I'm in her eyes
When I'm lookin in her eyes, bitch I'm triple nine, triple nine

[Verse]
Yeah the mood feel right, dancin' in the moonlight
We gon' do it all night, yeah we gon' do it all night
And that's on triple nine
That's on triple nine, triple nine
She be snortin' that white, cocaine what she like
Codeine on ice, double cup what I like
With the dirty sprite
Sippin' triple nine, triple nine
Sippin' triple nine, sippin' triple nine
And I got my nine
Put that on triple nine

[Chorus]
Rolly on me triple time
Bitch I'm triple nine
Light it up like Alkaline
She can feel the vibe, see it when I'm in her eyes
When I'm lookin in her eyes, yeah they hynotize
Yeah my rolly triple time
Bitch Im' triple nine
Light it up like Alkaline
She can feel the vibe, see it when I'm in her eyes
When I'm lookin in her eyes, bitch I'm triple nine, triple nine

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
Rolly on me triple time
Bitch I'm triple nine
Light it up like Alkaline
She can feel the vibe, see it when I'm in her eyes
When I'm lookin in her eyes, yeah they hynotize
Yeah my rolly triple time
Bitch Im' triple nine
Light it up like Alkaline
She can feel the vibe, see it when I'm in her eyes
When I'm lookin in her eyes, bitch I'm triple nine, triple nine
