[Intro]
I can make it sell

[Chorus]
Chillin' with the crew, icy all my jewels
Bad bitch, and I got her wetter than a pool (I can make it sell)
I do what I do, run up don't be fooled
40 on my hip and it's gon' do what it do
Almost made the news, but I hit the cruise
Police came around, so you know I couldn't lose (I can make it sell)
I do what I do, I do what I do, I do what I do, and I do it better than you

[Verse 1]
Pockets so high, I don't ever see low
Ballin' in the paint, finna hit an elbow
Yeah I get the green I ain't talkin' Ceelo
Yeah I play piano, and I got the C-Notes (I can make it sell)
Pull up on his ass, choppa make him hit low
Hit low, low like a limbo, let's go
Run up on me I blow, 40
Make a nigga call the, Five-0
I can make it sell (I can make it sell)
Ballin' on these niggas, goin' back to shoot a free throw
Headshots, leg shots like I'm D Rose
Steal a buck, GTA feel like D Bo

[Chorus]
Chillin' with the crew, icy all my jewels
Bad bitch, and I got her wetter than a pool (I can make it sell)
I do what I do, run up don't be fooled
40 on my hip and it's gon' do what it do
Almost made the news, but I hit the cruise
Police came around, so you know I couldn't lose (I can make it sell)
I do what I do, I do what I do, I do what I do, and I do it better than you

[Verse 2]
I can never lose, that's just what I do
Me and my crew just walked in the room
Acid and shrooms, I'm fly like a broom
Run up get hit, boy you dirty like broom (I can make it sell)
Gucci on my shirt, Goyard on my belt
Feel like I'm a wrestler, I'm flexin' with my belt
I make all this money, and I make it by myself
And you know I got that fire, I can send you straight to hell
I can make it sell, yeah you know I got them bells
I remember trappin', movin' bells (I can make it sell)
UPS I got them workers through the mail

[Chorus]
Chillin' with the crew, icy all my jewels
Bad bitch, and I got her wetter than a pool (I can make it sell)
I do what I do, run up don't be fooled
40 on my hip and it's gon' do what it do
Almost made the news, but I hit the cruise
Police came around, so you know I couldn't lose (I can make it sell)
I do what I do, I do what I do, I do what I do, and I do it better than you
