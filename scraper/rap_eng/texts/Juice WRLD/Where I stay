[Intro]
Hey girl thanks for coming to pick me up
No problem, so what made you come back to Chicago
Just visiting my mama
She okay?
Yeah she good
So by the way Juice called me, why you not gonna see him?
I don't know, I just got a lot on my mind

[Chorus]
Why you never come to where I stay
You was over there but you came to Chicago
Why you never come where I stay
You say you Foreign so I called that a Murcielago
Why am I tweaking on niggas that be on they basic shit
Please do not fall for these niggas they be on they basic shit
Please do not fuck with these niggas just get on your race and shit
Forget all these pussy ass niggas just get on the race and shit
I heard all this, basic shit like

[Hook]
You was over there but you came to Chicago
Why you never come to where I stay
You say you Foreign so I called that a Murcielago
Why am I tweaking on niggas that be on they basic shit

[Chorus]
Why you never come where I stay
We can go here we can drive to Chicago
Why you never come to where I stay
When I get this record deal baby I'ma get me a Murcielago
I don't really know bout no fucking relationship
But me and this money I swear we got the best relationship
I'm looking for me a new girl I can have me relations wit'
Cause you know that is some of my favorite shit

[Bridge]
You was over there but you came to Chicago
Why you never come to where I stay
You say you Foreign so I called that a Murcielago
Why am I tweaking on niggas that be on they basic shit
Please do not fall for these niggas they be on they basic shit

[Verse]
Twisted, I-I swear my vision is twistin'
I-I hope you hear just to listen
I hope I shine and I glisten
I know my niggas be ballin'
Just like a pivot
I want you baby, I don't got no hoes, I don't do none that pimpin'
But I'm ballin' Like Pippen
Say you like others well I beg to differ
Let's take down some liqour
Break this down quicker
Break down this swisher
Get in our feelings
Count to this money
Count up our winnings
I love smoking weed with you, Lord forgive me

[Outro]
Why you never come to where I stay
None of these niggas fuckin' wit' [?]
Smoking this grass
[?] in the [?]
Why you never come to where I stay
(Come to where I stay, Come to where I stay)
