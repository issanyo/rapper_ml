Teardrops in my eyes, I think she left me to die
I felt real love for the very first time. Do a miracle, give me a second try. Shawty I just wanna be right by your side. I know i'm weird, but that's how i live my life. Baby please don't make me cry. I give loyal love so baby do not hide. Take my hand, lets go for a ride. I promise you the time of your life
