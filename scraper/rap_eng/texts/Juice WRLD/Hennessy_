I've been thinking all night
I've been dreaming of the fast lane
Yeah, the fast life
I just left my black wife
For another black wife
Then I fuck my white wife
Four times, three nights

[Pre-Chorus]
She said she don't do coke
I call that a white lie
Even when I'm in Givenchy
I still tuck a .45
And it's still 3 9's 'til I die
And it's still 3 9's 'til I die
