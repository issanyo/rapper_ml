[Intro]
They're rotting my brain

[Verse 1]
I admit it, another ho got me finished
Broke my heart, oh no you didn't
Fuck sippin', I'ma down a whole bottle
Hard liquor, hard truth, can't swallow
Need a bartender, put me out my sorrow
Wake up the next day in the Monte Carlo
With a new woman, tell me she from Colorado
And she love women, she'll be gone by tomorrow
Who am I kiddin'?
All the jealousy and agony that I sit in
I'm a jealous boy, really feel like John Lennon
I just want real love, guess it's been a minute
Pissed off from the way that I don't fit in, I don't fit in
Tell me what's the secret to love, I don't get it
Feel like I be runnin' a race I'm not winnin'
Ran into the devil today, and she grinnin'

[Bridge]
Oh, oh, oh-oh

[Chorus 1]
All girls are the same
They're rotting my brain, love
Think I need a change
Before I go insane, love
All girls are the same
They're rotting my brain, love
Think I need a change
Before I go insane

[Verse 2]
Ten minutes, she told me it would take ten minutes
To break my heart, oh no she didn't
Fuck livin', I'ma drown in my sorrows
Fuck givin', I'ma take not borrow
And I'm still sinnin', still losin' my mind
I know I been trippin', still wastin' my time
All the time given, am I dyin'? Am I livin'?
It's fuck feelings, sorrow go up to the ceilin'

[Bridge]
Oh, oh, oh-oh

[Chorus 2]
Now I am insane
Demons in my brain, love
Peace I can't obtain
'Cause all these girls the same, love
Now I am insane
Demons in my brain, love
Peace I can't obtain
'Cause all these girls the same, love

[Outro]
All these girls the same, love
They're rotting my brain
