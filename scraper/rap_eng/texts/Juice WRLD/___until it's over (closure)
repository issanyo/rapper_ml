[Intro]
Bread, then I get my head
Bread, then I get my head, then I get my closure
Losing my composure
Get my bread, then I get my head, then I get my closure (my closure)
Losing my composure (my composure)
Enviyon on the mix

[Chorus]
Get my bread, then I get my head, then I get my closure
Dead bullets in his head, shouldn't have been a poser
Yeah, I don't want no friends, I'ma be a loner
Yeah, in it 'till the end, in it 'till it's over
Bread, then I get my head, then I get my closure
Dead bullets in his head, shouldn't have been a poser
Yeah, I don't want no friends, I'ma be a loner
Yeah, in it 'till the end, in it 'till it's over

[Verse 1]
Cash I need all the bread, need it all
Fourth quarter range ball, till I fall
Spend 50k floss in the mall
Countin' all this money Ima spend it all
Molly in her drank got her off the wall
Now she takin' xans with some adderall
Baby I'm the plug like I'm in the wall
I won't tell a soul baby, not at all
Jumpin' in the party and we finna rock out
He was talkin' shit I told that boy to pipe down
He don't know my brodie got it on him right now
Say one more word click-clack lights out

[Pre-Chorus]
One more word
He don't know my brodie got it on him right now
One more word
Say one more word click clack lights out

[Chorus]
Get my bread, then I get my head, then I get my closure
Dead bullets in his head, shouldn't have been a poser
Yeah, I don't want no friends, I'ma be a loner
Yeah, in it 'till the end, in it 'till it's over
Bread, then I get my head, then I get my closure
Dead bullets in his head, shouldn't have been a poser
Yeah, I don't want no friends, I'ma be a loner
Yeah, in it 'till the end, in it 'till it's over

[Verse 2]
Yeah, in it to the end in it to the end
Have no friends, pull up in the Benz, fuckin' on yo friends
On yo friend, that's my fuckin' main, she gon' do what I say
Whole time I'm runnin' game, run it like a relay
Whole time I'm runnin' game, run it like a relay
Fuck on yo fuckin' main, scratch it like a DJ
In my lane, in my fuckin' lane, 90 on the freeway
That's yo main, she just gave me brain, we just had a three-way
We just had a three-way
Money comin' three ways
Everyday I get paid
Everyday I get laid

[Outro]
And that's my closure, dead bullets in his head
Shouldn't have been a poser (he's a poser)
I'm in it 'till it's over
I'm in it 'till it's over
Then I get my closure
Shouldn't have been a poser
Ima be a loner
In it 'till it's over
Then I get my closure
Shouldn't have been a poser
