[Chorus]
I used to trap out Durangos
In the cuts I would lay low
Now I pull up in woods like Django
Talkin' shit then I give you a halo
I just wanna count up my pesos
I just wanna count up my pesos (huh)
I just wanna count up my pesos (yeah)
I just wanna count up my pesos (huh)
I used to trap out Durangos (yeah)
In the cuts I would lay low
Now I pull up in woods like Django
Talkin shit then I give you a halo
I just wanna count up my pesos
I just wanna count up my pesos (huh)
I just wanna count up my pesos (yeah)
I just wanna count up my pesos (huh)

[Verse: 1]
I wanna count up my pesos (yeah)
I shoot the three with my eyes closed (aye)
Ball on these hoes like an iso (yeah)
I used to trap on my iPhone (pew, pew)
I fuck with bitches that like hoes (hey)
Can't get enough of these white hoes (hey)
Look at my wrist it's a light show
If I look at your bitch then she might go
Remember when I trap at a light post (huh)
Whippin' my wrist like a psycho (yeah)
Gun on my hip like a psycho
Trap got green like Geico
Pop that bean, I'm psycho (huh)
Swim through the money like Michael (yeah)
I got my hand on my rifle (yea,yea)
I got my hand on my rifle
Remember when I trapped at a light post (light post)
Whippin' my wrist like a psycho (psycho)
Gun on my hip like a psycho (psycho)
Trap got green like Geico (geico)

I just wanna hop in that foreign
Drive it so fast that you think that I'm racin' (I'm racin')
Your boyfriend talkin' shit
I beat him so bad, that they thought I was racist (Like I'm racist)
Pull up in that whip, with them chains on my neck, but no I do not fuck with slavery (Nope!)

Your girl she lovin' the sex (ooh)
She love everything that I'm sayin' (yeah)
