[Chorus: Juice WRLD]
Wait, aye, pray to God I live another day (oh oh oh)
Chopper on me, put it to your face (oh oh oh)
I'm so high that I can't feel my face (woah woah woah)
Chopper like a pencil, get erased (go go go)
Shoot a motherfucker in the face (in the face)
She gon' give me top inside the Wraith (in the Wraith)
I keep all my rackades in the safe (ch-ching, ch-ching)
Combination, put it in the safe

[Verse 1: D Savage]
Combination, put it in the safe
I can't sleep until them pussies in the grave
What a day, what a day
Out of line, we gon' put you in your place
Claimin' you a shooter, knock it off, you ain't got no bodies
You a nobody, bloody and I'm cold hearted
Slidin' with my goons, that's my blood
Put you on the news, just because

[Chorus: Juice WRLD]
Pray to God I live another day (oh oh oh)
Chopper on me, put it to your face (oh oh oh)
I'm so high that I can't feel my face (woah woah woah)
Chopper like a pencil, get erased (go go go)
Shoot a motherfucker in the face (in the face)
She gon' give me top inside the Wraith (in the Wraith)
I keep all my rackades in the safe (ch-ching, ch-ching)
Combination, put it in the safe

[Verse 2: Juice WRLD]
Me and D Savage boolin' by the lake
Lookin' for some hoes to dinner date
If niggas want some beef, we make 'em steak
Pull up on 'em, no license plates, leave a nigga too erased
Yeah, I stay up in the studio, ain't takin' no calls
My homies just took your bitch, my nigga, that's your fault
You talkin' shit to us, we leave you face down in the sidewalk
Don't gotta say much, load it up and I'm lettin' my gun talk

[Chorus: Juice WRLD]
Aye, pray to God I live another day (oh oh oh)
Chopper on me, put it to your face (oh oh oh)
I'm so high that I can't feel my face (woah woah woah)
Chopper like a pencil, get erased (go go go)
Shoot a motherfucker in the face (in the face)
She gon' give me top inside the Wraith (in the Wraith)
I keep all my rackades in the safe (ch-ching, ch-ching)
Combination, put it in the safe
