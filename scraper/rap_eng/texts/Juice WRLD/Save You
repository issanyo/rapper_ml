[Intro]
Uhh
Would you really kill yourself
Told me that you're suicidal
It's really hard for me to help
Saving you, I'm not a bible
But if you did I would never forgive me
All my life I would probably feel empty
Close my eyes, I would think of you, baby
That's why I care when you say "save me"
Put your head on my chest
Put your pain on my neck
Close your eyes, don't be upset
Just know that I love you
Just know that I lov-


[Chorus]
Would you really kill yourself
You told me that you're suicidal
It's really hard for me to help
Saving you, I'm not a bible
But if you did I would never forgive me
All my life I would probably feel empty
Close my eyes, I would think of you, baby
That's why I care when you say "save me"
Put your head on my chest
Put your pain on my neck
Close your eyes, don't be upset
Just know that I love you
Just know that I love you


[Verse 1]
Nobody dying today, baby
I'll be here 'cause I want you to stay, baby
Leave the past 'cause those people were shady
Cut 'em off, they was making you crazy
You're better off with me
Let's take off Houston not dying like Whitney
Can't drink liquor with some fucked up kidneys
I'm not trynna be lean, washed up by 50
No, I just really, really, really wanna ride with you
Sold the fucking Yeezy to just vibe with you
I don't need nothing to get high with you
I'll give you the world if it's alright with you


[Chorus]
Would you really kill yourself
You told me that you're suicidal
It's really hard for me to help
Saving you, I'm not a bible
But if you did I would never forgive me
All my life I would probably feel empty
Close my eyes, I would think of you, baby
That's why I care when you say "save me"
Put your head on my chest
Put your pain on my neck
Close your eyes, don't be upset
Just know that I love you
Just know that I love you


[Outro]
People taking steps towards suicide
It's very important that you support them
One thousand percent
It just sucks when it gets to a point to where there is no-
No way to change what happened
There's no way for me to bring this girl back
