[Intro]
Yeah

The pieces in my life, go right with you
I really care for you
Forever in my life, only you

The pieces in my life, go right with you
Forever in my life

[Verse 1]
Forever forever she stay on my mind like forever forever, forever forever
For worse or for better I'm willing to fight for her heart it's a pleasure
Hope she get the message I swear she a angel thats born back to heaven
Man fuck all the stressing and fighting I want you forever forever
I'm writing these verses, rehearse it, record it and play it at your request
I feel like it's us two forever, but I think that we just don't know it yet
I swear life is a bitch Imma toss it to pong cause I feel like it's playing fetch
You keepin' my heart hurt you tossin' it baby I know I hate playing catch
Forever forever, say that no matter no weather
Heart getting colder than winter
But I say no matter the weather and don't you forget it
I look at love and then have all these questions
I look at you and then get all these answers
Fuck all these hoes can you please mind my manners
Monkey around cause you drive me bananas
You put the nails to my hammer
Without you I'm deadly like cancer
Think of you once and i feel like its rushin' the plan
And then baby I'm not being antsy, I'm just hoping you understand me
Look what you do to me, this is so crazy
I'm happy to call you my lady
I'm happy to say we together and I hope this shit last forever forever

[Chorus]
Forever in my life, only you
The pieces in my life, go right with you
Yeah
Forever in my life, only you
I love you
The pieces in my life, go right with you
I hope you feelin' this as much as I am
Forever in my life, only you
The pieces in my life, go right with you
Forever in my life, only you
It's really crazy how I feel about you
The pieces in my life, go right with you

[Verse 2]
This one finna' get personal though, check
I'm losin' my mind, I'm losin' my mind, you drivin' me crazy
The shit we got into, the shit that we been through, shit life is amazing
I'm not going nowhere, you not going nowhere so baby just face it
You're perfectly perfect for me
Baby I'm able to actually give you this label my queen
Girl you deserve it we been through our bullshit, but girl it was worth it
I found Ms. Right, I can't do no more searchin'
Fuck all the clowin', shit this not a circus
I love for a reason I love for a purpose
Wasn't an accident this is on purpose
Put that on God I can't do no more merchin'
Don't turn your back I can't take no more hurtin'
Baby I swear that your love get me the highest I look down below and I think that I'm flying
But really I'm falling, falling in love with you
Girl it's because of you girl you the finest
Searching for love and you just helped me find it
Lets leave the bullshit and garbage behind us
Fuck the mistakes lets not let them remind us
Cause we at the top and lets do some more climbing
Girl at this point, I'm pretty sure now you know just what you do to me
This shit that's new to me girl
Finding my way through this jungle of life and it's foolery so just get used to me girl
I'm new to relationships usually girls be abusing me they just be using me girl
This got me thinking forever no matter no weather that it's gone be you and me girl
