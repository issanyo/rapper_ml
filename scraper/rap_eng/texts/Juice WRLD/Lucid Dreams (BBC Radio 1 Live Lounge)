[Chorus]
I still see your shadows in my room
Can't take back the love that I gave you
It’s to the point where I love and I hate you
But I cannot change you, so I must replace you, oh
Easier said than done, I thought you were the one
Listenin' to my heart instead of my head
You found another one, but I am the better one
I won't let you forget me
I still see your shadows in my room
Can’t take back the love that I gave you
It's to the point where I love and I hate you
But I cannot change you, so I must replace you
Easier said than done, I thought you were the one
Listenin' to my heart instead of my head
You found another one, but I am the better one
I won't let you forget me

[Verse]
I have these lucid dreams where I can't move a thing
Thinking of you in my bed
You were my everything
Thoughts of a wedding ring
Now I'm just better off dead

I'll do it over again
I didn't want this to end
I should’ve listened to my friends, no
I put this shit in the past, and I want it to last
You were made outta plastic, fake
I was tangled up in your drastic ways
Who knew evil boys had the prettiest face?
I gave you a heart that was full of mistakes
You gave me your heart then you made heart break

[Bridge]
You made my heart break
You made my heart break
You made my heart break again
You made my heart break
You made my heart break
You made my heart break again

[Chorus]
And I still see your shadows in my room
Can’t take back the love that I gave you
It's to the point where I love and I hate you
But I cannot change you, so I must replace you
Easier said than done, I thought you were the one
Listenin’ to my heart instead of my head
You found another one, but I am the better one
I won't let you forget me
