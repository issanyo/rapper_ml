[Chrous]
Same way she come (Same way)
Same way she leave (Yeah, the same damn way)
All women scum (oh)
Get the fuck away from me (uh uh, uh uh, uh uh)
I was blinded by love (I was blind)
But now I can see (I can see, I can see)
You ain’t never made me happy (no, no)
You just made me believe

[Verse: 1]
Realest shit I ever spoke, spoke, spoke
Realest shit I never wrote, wrote, wrote
Mixed the perky with the Four Loko whoa
You're not supposed to mixed the liquor with the narcos
Damn that’s to numb the pain from these
Scandalous bitches in my brain I mean
All girls seem to be the same I mean
Your girl still gon' give me brain I mean
Let the wind blow her out my life
Anything romantic turns to suicide, suicide
Let the wind blow her out my life
Anything romantic turn to suicide, suicide

[Chorus]
Same way she come (Same way)
Same way she leave (Yeah, the same damn way)
All women scum
Get the fuck away from me (uh uh, uh uh, uh uh)
I was blinded by love (I was blind)
But now I can see (I can see, I can see)
You ain’t never made me happy (no, no)
You just made me believe

[Verse: 2]
You make me believe
Love ain’t meant for me
This is crazy, this insanity
Thought you was my lady, now you hate me
Still got the blueprints yeah, no Jay-Z
I wear Gucci, Louis, Fendi kicks just to hide the pain
Balenciaga on my sweater and umbrella for the rain
I always told myself I would never fall in love again
The next day I find a new queen to fall in love again
Don’t got nothin' to gain
I’m sittin' in the rain
She just ruined my life, and she stole my cocaine
I don’t even do no cocaine
I don't want that shit no way
I go that shit for her to increase the foreplay
Yeah

[Chorus]
Same way she come (Same way)
Same way she leave (Yeah, the same damn way)
All women scum
Get the fuck away from me (uh uh, uh uh, uh uh)
I was blinded by love (I was blind)
But now I can see (I can see, I can see)
You ain’t never made me happy (no, no)
You just made me believe
