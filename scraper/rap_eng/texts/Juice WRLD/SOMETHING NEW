[Intro]
Money come and go
Bitches come and go too
Money come and go
Bitches come and go too
Money come and go
Bitches come and go too
Money come and go
Bitches come and go too
Money come and go
Come and go
Money come and go
Come and go

[Chorus x2]
Money come and go
Bitches come and go too
She was getting old
Have to cop something new
First I'll drop my hoe, then i drop my sunroof
Then I throw my dough up, because I want to

[Verse 1]
Gettin' to these commas, cause you know I want to
'Member when they hated on me in the lunch room
Now they on my phone and they wanna come through
Imma play these hoes like they in a game room
Looking at the world, like what has it come to
Looking at your girl, Imma make her cum too
I don't gotta chase, Imma make her run too
She ain't just for me, boy she for the whole crew, oh
Look at my shoes, hoe
Rick Owens too, gettin' my groove on
Fuckin' your new hoe
All in my room (? my new hoe)
Rick Owens too, gettin' my groove on
Fuckin' your new hoe
? my new hoe

[Chorus x2]
Money come and go
Bitches come and go too
She was getting old
Have to cop something new
First I'll drop my hoe, then i drop my sunroof
Then I throw my dough up, because I want to

[Verse 2]
When I get my cash up
Tell 'em catch up
I just took his main hoe
In this backup
Now she wanna act up
Tell her back up
He gon' need some backup
Get 'em back up
Waitin' for my moment and the time is right now
Presidential rally like I'm in the White House
I was in the trap cookin' Amy Whinehouse
All my niggas ballin', we shouldn't lie south
Don't try me, I got the pipe out
Lookin' like the winter time, I got the ice out
Don't try me, I got the pipe out
Lookin' like the winter time, I got my ice out
50K on shoes
Maison Margiela, when I'm ballin' I don't lose
Eeny meeny miny moe, these bitches finally shoosh
I finess the revenue

[Chorus x2]
Money come and go
Bitches come and go too
She was getting old
Have to cop something new
First I'll drop my hoe, then i drop my sunroof
Then I throw my dough up, because I want to

[Outro]
Had to cop me something new
Then I drop my sunroof
Because I want to
