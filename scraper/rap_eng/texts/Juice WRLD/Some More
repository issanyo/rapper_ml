[Chorus]
Love don't love me
Bitch I know
But the drugs still love me
That's for sure
She fell in love with a junky, gettin' the dough
Fuck her one time, then show her to the door
Everything she said, I heard it all before
I see all these demons, they disguise as whores
All I know is count the money up from the floor
If the pussy good, I might just go get some more, more

[Verse]
Say she want my heart, she can't afford it
Maybe cause I'm on my way to getting on the Forbes list
Pretty Jiggy nigga, can't ignore it
Ballin' bitch, I feel like Michael Jordan
Sip Codeine, I'm snorin
Til' the mornin'
Got the heater on my hip, like global warmin'
Run up you get shot, this is a warnin'
Freddy Kruger in your dreams, I'm filled with torment
She say that she love me bitch, whatever that means
I remember her and our friends were laughin' at me
Now they tell me I can fuck, that shit so funny to me
Lost 10 thousand playin' basketball, 100 to me

[Chorus]
Love don't love me
Bitch I know
But the drugs still love me
That's for sure
She fell in love with a junky, gettin' the dough
Fuck her one time, then show her to the door
Everything she said, I heard it all before
I see all these demons, they disguise as whores
All I know is count the money up from the floor
If the pussy good, I made you go get some more, more
