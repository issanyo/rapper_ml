[Lyrics from Snippet]

[Chorus]
Codeine Guzzler on a notha level
In a Tesla, rollin' off a Tesla
Niggas tryin catch me lackin, get the best of
Me but, I got my hand on my Smith and Wesson
This a Waveee, I’m the ocean
Shawty like a slaveee, with my chains on
Flex that at the Raveee, get my Rave on
Slide in a Wraithhh, Avon

[Verse]
Kind of Rich just handle my business
Bitch trippin get out yo feelings
I been winning, winning we winning
Hop on my dick bitch like Tigger
I need a thick bitch with a figure
Wi-wi-wipe me down
Got it on the rideee right now
Ask where I'm from baby Im from Chi-Town
[?]

[Chorus]
Codeine Guzzler on a notha level
In a Tesla, rollin' off a Tesla
Niggas tryin catch me lackin, get the best of
Me but, I got my hand on my Smith and Wesson
This a Waveee, I’m the ocean
Shawty like a slaveee, with my chains on
Flex that at the Raveee, get my Rave on
Slide in a Wraithhh, Avon

[Verse]
Birkin Bag they gon stop and stare
Whatchu got in there? Nun of yo Beesness
Half a brick to share with my niggas
Got some swishers yea filled with killas
[?]
Niggas say they some killers, not gone do it if they don't have a pill
Pull them back like a Banana, Bananas up on me the Draco is real
[?] , eat these fools like a happy meal
[?], than a happy meal
I can show you how to rap for real
I can show you how to trap for real
In the trap with the RAF's for real
