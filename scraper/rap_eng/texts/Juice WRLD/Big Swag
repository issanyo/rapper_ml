Do yo dance on they ass, make em pissed off

Young rich nigga run up a check

Richer than a bitch, I can't go back

[Verse 2]
Damn, would you look at the time (tick tock)
The whole wide world is feelin' the vibe
Sit down, buckle up, it's a long ride
This a spaceship, all hands inside
Zoom, past the hate
In the room, gravitate
From your doom, to a new day
I pour you up some lean, with some Dousse
Not a role model, I just know how it go
Do this for the kids, yeah the fans at my shows
If she don't love you, let her go, he a hater let him know
Then throw them hundreds in the air, and turn up the stereo

[Chorus]
On that big swag
On that big sauce
On that bitch, drip
On that bitch, ball
On that big swag
On that big sauce
On that bitch, drip
On that bitch, ball
Hater mad, hater really pissed off
Do yo dance on they ass, make em pissed off
On that big swag
On that big sauce
On that bitch, drip
On that bitch, ball
On that bitch
Young rich nigga drippin' and flexin
Young rich nigga run up a check
Young rich nigga drippin' and flexin
Young rich nigga run up a check
