[Intro: Ski Mask the Slump God]
Huh
Wet

[Chorus: Ski Mask the Slump God]
Hey, mister (Mister), I might give a Glock to my sister (To my sister)
'Cause it's a dirty world, you could get hurt (You can get hurt, huh)
Told her enemies to kiss my keister (Huh, my keister)
Hey, mister (Hey, mister, huh, huh), hey, mister (Mister, huh)
I might give a Glock to my sister (To my what? Huh)
It's a dirty world, you could get hurt (You could get hurt, huh)
Told her enemies to kiss my keister (Kiss my keister)
Hey, mister (Hey, mister)

[Verse: Ski Mask the Slump God]
Hey, mister (Mister)
Yeah, bustin' at these bitches like a blister (Huh)
TSA her any day, I frisk her
Sippin' on this lean until my lips hurt, ow, my liver
Know your pockets hurt, yuh
Renegade, I'm 'bout my currency
You'll get a fist serve, yuh
Balenciaga sock on me all green like the Grinch, sir, yuh
Your diamonds hurricane cloudy, they might need a rinse sir, huh
When I attack her, my dick like a sword, I'ma fence her
Warm up my dick, bench her
Call her my dear, Prancer
When she call my phone, no answer
I'ma dip on the bitch like ranch syrup
Spread the positivity like cancer
Tryna kill my spirits, they can't, sir
Dress retro like a lancer (Ayy, ayy)
Like Spongebob, hereâ€™s my answer

[Chorus: Ski Mask the Slump God]
Hey, mister (Mister), I might give a Glock to my sister (To my, to my)
'Cause it's a dirty world, you could get hurt (Water, you could get hurt)
Told her enemies to kiss my keister (Kiss my keister)
Hey, mister (Hey, mister)
Hey, mister (Mister), I might give a Glock to my sister
It's a dirty world, you could get hurt
Told her enemies to kiss my keister
Mister

[Verse 2: Juice WRLD]
Hey Mister (Mister)
Tried to shoot at 'ya but I missed 'ya (but I missed 'ya)
Now I gotta aim it at your sister (I'ma get her)
What your peoples tell you about getting your fam involved?
You got a funeral next week, guess what, nigga?
That's your fucking fault

[Chorus: Ski Mask the Slump God, Juice WRLD & Both]
Hey, mister (Mister), I might give a Glock to my sister (to my sister, huh)
'Cause it's a dirty world, you could get her (You could get, water)
Told her enemies to kiss my keister
(Kiss my muthafuckin' ass! my keister)
Hey, mister (Hey, mister)
Hey Mister (Mister), I might give a Glock to my sister (To my-what?)
It's a dirty world, you could get hurt (You could get hurt)
Told her enemies to kiss my keister (Kiss my keister)
Hey, mister (Hey, mister)

[Verse 3: Juice WRLD]
Bitch, I said the keister
Hey, mister, don't you try to run or we'll find 'ya
Yeah, this uzi, we ain't playing, we gon' blind 'ya
Yeah, we run through your front door, we don't like ya's
One stripes, two Stripe
Pull up to your block and let off all the stripes
Hey mister, don't you get hurt playing gangster
You a lame, you a joke
Hey mister
It's a dirty world you would get hurt
Might give a Glock to my sister
Please sir, it's a cold world, you would get hurt
Please sir, leave red stains on your t-shirt
My turf, get hurt, bitch I am a loser
Once you get a clue sir
Bye-bye, loser
