[Chorus]
The Asylum
Oh no, oh no, niggas beefin' over hoes
Oh no, I can't love no hoe, that's a no go
She only came for the promo
Oh no, oh no, niggas beefin' over hoes, oh no
One thing I know that's for sure though
You can't love no hoe, no

[Verse]
You're damn right, you're damn right I know
You're damn right, you're damn right I'm lovin' no hoe
At least not anymore
It's alright, I know my heart broke
It's alright, I don't give a fuck no more
It's all about the dough
It's all about the dough, yeah I know
I'm fuckin' on your hoe
You should know, she's not as loyal as you think so
It's time to leave her and get a new hoe
I'm done with one girl, I fuck with two hoes
I hit the party and get a few more
I'm fresh to death, this Gucci my funeral
I'm fresh to death, this Louis my funeral
I'm fresh to death, I'm fresh to death
She tells me love is breaking bad, no crystal meth
She said this shit is suicide, don't kill yourself
Just treat it like a broken glass, just build yourself
It's alright, I know my heart broke
It's alright, I don't give a fuck no more
It's all about the dough

[Chorus]
The Asylum
Oh no, oh no, niggas beefin' over hoes
Oh no, I can't love no hoe, that's a no go
She only came for the promo
Oh no, oh no, niggas beefin' over hoes
One thing I know that's for sure though
You can't love no hoe, no, no, no
