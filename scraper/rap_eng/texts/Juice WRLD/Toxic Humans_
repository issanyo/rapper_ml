Snippet

[Hook]
I've been waiting, I'm contemplating
Say you love me girl you were playing
None of this don't matter when we die
I won't wipe your tears not when you cry
This ain't love girl, this more like hatred
I've been down this road so many times before
Hoes in my phone, they're your replacement
But they feel nothing like you, you made me whole

[Verse 1]
I can't tell, if this is a dream
Am I awake or am I asleep
I don't have answers, philosophies
Mean nothing to me right now
And I can't tell, if you were with me or against me
All my friends say you're icky vicky
I feel like Timmy, I keep on wishing
For better days, better days
Need some stronger pills for better days
I been risking my life since you been away
Tryna' get your attention from far away
I've been having lucid dreams, stupid dreams
Thinkin' bout you and me, fluently
I've been experimenting to take the pain away
Wake up thinking I heard your name

[Hook]
I've been waiting, I'm contemplating
Say you love me girl you were playing
None of this don't matter when we die
I won't wipe your tears not when you cry
This ain't love girl, this more like hatred
I've been down this road so many times before
Hoes in my phone, they're your replacement
But they feel nothing like you, you made me whole

[Verse 2]
This is the part where I confess that
Most of my relations were toxic
Happiness will come when its ready
Hold out your hands and embrace it with open arms
This is the part where I confess that
Toxic humans come off attractive
I made this song for anyone that's
Going through it, I'll clean up the mess
Na na na na
Na na na na
Na na na na na na na
Na na na na
Na na na na
Na na na na na na
Whats the matter
Questions are unanswered

Hey

I've been waiting, I'm contemplating
Say you love me girl you were playing
None of this don't matter when we die
I won't wipe your tears not when you cry
This ain't love girl, this more like hatred
I've been down this road too many times before
Hoes in my phone, they are replacements
But they feel nothing like you, you made me whole
