[Intro]
(She an angel with them devil horns, yeah)
(Devil horns, yeah)

[Chorus]
She an angel with them devil horns, yeah
Devil horns, yeah, devil horns, yeah
Never met a girl like this before, yeah
This before, yeah, this before, yeah
She put my belongings at the door, yeah
At the door, yeah, at the door, yeah
Close the coffin, put it in a morgue, yeah
In a morgue, yeah, in a morgue yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
She was like the girls from the movies
Everybody saying she gon' use me
She really had me looking like a fool, who am I fooling?
She was way more than a groupie
Pretty like a fresh pair of Gucci
She give me brain and she smoke on them loosies, so loosely
I told her nothing ever really moves me
So I don't know why she got me up in my feelings
And I don't know if it's agony that I'm feeling
But I'm feeling

[Bridge]
Na na na na, na na na
I regret everything that I said
Drink my sorrows and regrets away, away

[Chorus]
She an angel with them devil horns, yeah
Devil horns, yeah, devil horns, yeah
Never met a girl like this before, yeah
This before, yeah, this before, yeah
She put my belongings at the door, yeah
At the door, yeah, at the door, yeah
Close the coffin, put it in a morgue, yeah
In a morgue, yeah, in a morgue yeah, yeah

[Verse 2]
As the liquor kicks in, she's swimming through my head
Her hands in my dreads, yeah
Fill me up with dread
Watch as she goes, as I come too close
To my overdose, she won't hold me close
If she does the most, yeah I mean the most of the pills
And the Henny, I ain't living on my own

[Bridge]
Na na na na, na na na na
Na na na na, na na na na
Na na na na, na na na na
Na na na na, na na na na

Na na na na, na na na
I regret everything that I said
Drink my sorrows and regrets away, away

[Chorus]
She an angel with them devil horns, yeah
Devil horns, yeah, devil horns, yeah
Never met a girl like this before, yeah
This before, yeah, this before, yeah
She put my belongings at the door, yeah
At the door, yeah, at the door, yeah
Close the coffin, put it in a morgue, yeah
In a morgue, yeah, in a morgue yeah, yeah
