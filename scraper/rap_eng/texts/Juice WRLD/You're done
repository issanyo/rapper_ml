[Intro]
Lost in the abyss over ya

[Chorus]
Bitch you're done [x5] (uh)
Bitch you’re done [x3]
What have you done (what have you done)
Bitch you're done [x3] (yeah)
Bitch you are done (bitch you are done)
Bitch you're done [x3]
I’m not the one, I'm not the one (bitch)
I'm not the one (bitch)

[Verse]
I will not fall inside of your abyss
I will not fall for the golden rod
Bully cause I'm around
Bitch goes around
Karma's a bitch
God has a ugly frown
I know that first hand
And so you will too, too, too, too
You'll catch smoke by the second hand
Cancer is coming to you, you, you

[Bridge]
Time is up, time is up, time is up, yeah time is up
Bitch you're done [x3], in the abyss

[Chorus]
Bitch you're done [x5] (uh)
Bitch you’re done [x3]
What have you done (what have you done)
Bitch you’re done [x3] (yeah)
Bitch you are done (bitch you are done)
Bitch you're done [x3]
I’m not the one, I'm not the one (bitch)
I'm not the one (bitch)
