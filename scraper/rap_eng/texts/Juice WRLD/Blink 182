[Intro: Juice WRLD]
Fucked your boo

[Chorus: Juice WRLD]
I just fucked your boo
To Blink 182
An anti-social dude
She don't like people too
I just fucked your boo
To Blink 182
An anti-social dude
Ohh-ohh-ohh-ohh

[Verse 1: Juice WRLD]
I'm having a blue day
So I'm listening to Green Day
Then I fuck her to some Coldplay
Then I fuck her to some Cobain
While she snortin' up the cocaine
We get high just so we won't feel pain
Umbrella man the drugs for the heart ring

[Pre-Chorus: Juice WRLD]
Ah-ah-ah-antisocial
Ah-ah-ah-antisocial
[?]
Oh, ohh

[Chorus: Juice WRLD]
I just fucked your boo
To Blink 182
An anti-social dude
She don't like people too
I just fucked your boo
To Blink 182
An anti-social dude
Ohh-ohh-ohh-ohh

[Verse 2: Tyla Yaweh]
I fell in love, this girl just overdosed
This bitch, she talk too much
You niggas acting way too sus'
Know I'm the hood and I'm never wearin' robins
Always in the hood and my niggas keep it solid
40 on the waist so you know they gonna rob 'em
Hittin' licks daily, you know they gonna rob 'em
I take drugs too much, and I can't trust no one
So I keep 40 tucked, 'cause I can't trust no one

[Chorus: Juice WRLD]
I just fucked your boo
To Blink 182
An anti-social dude
She don't like people to
I just fucked your boo
To Blink 182
An anti-social dude
Ohh ohh ohh ohh
