[Intro]
If you flexin' on my name get a lesson (x2)
Bring the party this way
Chop a chop a brick, I been trappin' like a sensei
We can do it

[Chorus x2]
You will never catch me flexin'
Demo checkin'
With my weapon
Step in my direction
You'll get wrecked in
Fuck her for a couple seconds
Then I pass
Run up got my Smith & Wesson
You won't last
And I'm flexin'


[Verse 1]
If you flexin' on my name get a lesson
said she love me till' she found out im finnesin'
Well im sorry baby
I'm goin' money crazy
So this money comin' first you come in second
Never second, always first like impressions
That's impressive
I'ma fuck that bitch for pleasure
That's forever
Diamonds froze change the weather
For the better


[Verse 2]
I'm Mayweather with the fists
Winner with the wrists
Fourth quarter shawty
I'ma ball like a bitch
Molly in the mix
You can bring the party this way
Chop a chop a brick, I been trappin' like a sensei
We can do it that way
We can do it this way
We gon' do it my way
We won't do it his way
Baby I will check him
I will demo wreck him
Never catch me flexin'
But I bet I flex
And you'll never catch me flexin'


[Bridge]
With my weapon
Step in my direction
You'll get wrecked in
Fuck her for a couple seconds
Run up got my Smith & Wesson

[Chorus x2]
You will never catch me flexin'
Demo checkin'
With my weapon
Step in my direction
You'll get wrecked in
Fuck her for a couple seconds
Then I pass
Run up got my Smith & Wesson
You won't last
And I'm flexin'
