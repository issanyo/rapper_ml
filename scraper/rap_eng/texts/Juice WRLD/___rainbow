[Chorus]
Pockets on big not little
Got white like Malcolm no middle, oh
My bitch give me migraines, need percocets, no Tylenol
If I want it I get it
Fuckin with me she get it all
Diamonds different color like Skittles
Diamonds different color like Skittles, oh
She taste the Rainbow
While I count the bankroll, oh
She taste the Rainbow
While I count the bankroll, oh
Pockets on big not little
Diamonds different color like Skittles
Diamonds different color like Skittles, oh

[Verse 1]
I'm getting faded
I'm driving different places
I'm in L.A. livin' life
Put my dick in your wife
I tie up my laces
I'm ballin' like I'm Calvin Cambridge
My Margiela's make me Like Mike
Jumping from the free throw line
She's running through my head
Do Xanax 'til I'm dead
Came up on so much money that shit do not make no sense
My diamonds different colors like a rainbow in hair
I smoke away my problems but they won't disappear
I don't have any friends
I'm in it 'til the end
My girlfriend say she hate me cause' of percocets again
She always think I'm cheating, all these hoes in my crib
I tell her I don't love them I just fuck them and dip
I just fuck them and dip
Taste the Rainbow

[Chorus]
Pockets on big not little
Got white like Malcolm no middle, oh
My bitch give me migraines, need percocets, no Tylenol
If I want it I get it
Fuckin with me she get it all
Diamonds different color like Skittles
Diamonds different color like Skittles, oh
She taste the Rainbow
While I count the bankroll, oh
She taste the Rainbow
While I count the bankroll, oh
Pockets on big not little
Pockets on big not little, oh
Diamonds different color like Skittles
Diamonds different color like Skittles, oh

[Verse 2]
Pockets on big not little
Pockets on big not little
I just got that white, Malcolm in the Middle
Play her like a fiddle
Play her like a fiddle, oh
I'm in her mouth, put my dick all in her jaw
She taste the Rainbow
Fresh to death, Gucci's with a halo
Run up on me, I'm Kalo
Choppa on me shoot fuego
She taste the Rainbow
I shoot like Rambo, oh
Feel like Mutombo
Get that shit up out my house
I'm 'bout my money
I'm gon' stack it out
Your girl dancing
Watch her walk it out
She know what I'm talking 'bout
Fucking all these bitches in they mama house
Then I fuck they mama in they mama house
You know what I'm talking 'bout
She taste the Rainbow
Oh, she taste the Rainbow

[Outro]
Got white like Malcolm no middle, oh
My bitch give me migraines, oh
Fuckin with me she get it all
Diamonds different color like Skittles
She taste the Rainbow, oh
She taste the Rainbow, oh
Pockets on big not little
