[Intro: Future & Juice WRLD]
Feel like (I'm working on dying)
The world on drugs
The world on drugs, drugs
I need a fix

[Chorus: Future, Juice WRLD & Both]
The world on drugs (Uh), can you give me some? (Uh)
I don't feel no pain 'cause this pill got me numb
The world on drugs, yeah, yeah
The world on drugs, yeah, the world on drugs
The world on drugs, yeah
The world on drugs

[Post-Chorus: Future & Juice WRLD]
I can hear these voices in my head
If I'm sober then I might be dead
I can see the devil in my bed (In my bed)
I was born a rebel, I'm not scared (I'm a rebel)
You been takin' drugs, and you been hidin' it from me (Hidin')
You been takin' drugs, and you've been lyin' to me (Yeah)
Ayy, I don't believe you (I don't believe you), I done popped off (Popped off)
I don't believe you (I don't believe you), you a knockoff (Yeah)
I don't believe you (Don't believe you), go on and pop off 'Cause the world on drugs

[Chorus: Future & Juice WRLD]
'Cause the world on drugs (The world on drugs)

[Verse 2: Future & Juice WRLD]
I came in stylin', I don't need a stylist (I don't need a stylist)
Yeah I'm good on deposits, I don't need a wallet
'Bout to go up, call me Scotty
I'm 'bout to go up, you can pass me a water
I pop the pills in the 'Rari
Had lil' mama gone in the passenger
You tryna sneak and get high
You need to come talk with me
I just be actin' shy, poppin' these Mollies
I can't never be sober
I'ma come knockin' at your door like Jehovah
Girl, I brought us a pill, let's go take it
I brought us some chronic, ain't gon' lace it
We been in the club in the matrix
There's not a better feelin', no replacin' it

[Chorus: Future & Juice WRLD]
The world on drugs, can you give me some?
I don't feel no pain 'cause this pill got me numb
The world on drugs, the world on drugs
Yeah the world on drugs, yeah the world on drugs
The world on drugs

[Post-Chorus: Future & Juice WRLD]
I can hear these voices in my head
If I'm sober then I might be dead
I can see the devil in my bed (In my bed)
I was born a rebel I'm not scared (I'm a rebel)
You been takin' drugs, and you been hidin' it from me (Hidin')
You been takin' drugs, and you've been lyin' to me (Yeah)
Ayy, I don't believe you, I done popped off
I don't believe you (I don't believe you), you a knockoff
I don't believe you (Don't believe you), go on and pop off 'Cause the world on drugs
