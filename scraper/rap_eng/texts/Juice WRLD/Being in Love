[Chorus: Juice WRLD]
Even when I'm sleep, I feel awake
When you're away
Everything with you is such a chase, cut to the chase
Almost left my side the other day, it makes me shake
Knowin' you would go and walk away, you can't be replaced
Can't tell you how I feel, I can't explain
But for you I'ma try to get these lyrics out my brain
And for you I will fly, through the hell, through the flames
Always, always, love you always

[Verse 1: Juice WRLD]
For your love, workin' all day, fuck a off day
You lookin' cute in your Bape shit baby, you could go Ape
All of these other bitches are sha nae naes, Martin like Payne
I am in love with a beautiful lady, she's in my brain
Star you set my heart on fire, 420 blaze
Yeah, no cliche, I can't explain
I got your name, tatted on my brain, tatted on my mind
Teen Titan, got the Starfire by my side
Clark Kent if she kiss me, it make me fly
Sad boy, if she leaves me it makes me cry
Flash boy, if she needs me, be there in no time
She's all right
So I gave it a go, I gave it a turn
I gave her my heart, I'm willin' to learn
And it changed my life, I'm tryna get close with the stars tonight

[Chorus: Juice WRLD]
Even when I'm sleep, I feel awake
When you're away
Everything with you is such a chase, cut to the chase
Almost left my side the other day, it makes me shake
Knowin' you would go and walk away, you can't be replaced
Can't tell you how I feel, I can't explain
But for you I'ma try to get these lyrics out my brain
And for you I will fly, through the hell, through the flames
Always, always, love you always

[Verse 2: RY$TER]
She's a devil in disguise, yeah an angel in my mind
She be flyin' to my heart, [?]
Yeah I'm tryin' to run away but she be wasting my time
Yeah she be so fine she mine, and she's the only one in mind
Yeah baby you're one of the best that I've ever had
Yeah some kind of drug and I can't have enough
When I see you 'round I can't sober up
And you said that you loved me, and I trusted you
I can't make the same mistakes, nah no way
And people change, feelings change, so did I
Don't worry baby, I won't listen to no lies
And I thought you were the one
Yeah, then you broke my heart, left me in the dark
I can see you in my nightmares, I can see you in my nightmares

[Chorus: Juice WRLD]
Even when I'm sleep, I feel awake
When you're away
Everything with you is such a chase, cut to the chase
Almost left my side the other day, it makes me shake
Knowin' you would go and walk away, you can't be replaced
Can't tell you how I feel, I can't explain
But for you I'ma try to get these lyrics out my brain
And for you I will fly, through the hell, through the flames
Always, always, love you always
