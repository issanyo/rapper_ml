[Intro: Kodak Black]
I'm stompin'
Let's start a moshpit
Fuck a protest, let's start a moshpit
Yeah

[Chorus: Kodak Black & Juice WRLD]
Red bottom kicks, I feel like stompin' in here (Ya dig)
No oatmeal and grits, I'm eatin' codfish in here (Uh-huh)
New space coupe, feel like a martian in here (Yeah)
Fuck a protest, let's start a moshpit (Fuck a protest)
Red bottom kicks, I feel like stompin' in here (Ya dig)
No oatmeal and grits, I'm eatin' cod fish in here (Eatin' cod fish in here)
New space coupe, feel like a martian in here (Skrrt)
Fuck a protest, let's start a moshpit (Start a moshpit)

[Verse 1: Juice WRLD]
Out of space, hot like a martian in here
Doing donuts in the lot, ain't no parkin' in here (Yeah)
We about that action, ain't no talkin' in here
Shorty twerkin' on the walls, Peter Parker in here (Ayy)
Haters in the rear view
Ex on my phone, we too loud, I can't hear you
His blood turn his coat red, I will Paul Revere you
I'ma ball 'til I fall, I will Cavalier you
Space Jam jumpin', they askin' who let the monsters in here
I'm with killers I'm with straight Jeffrey Dahmers in here
I hang with animals, lil' brodie brought the llama in here
Money old, old enough to fuck your mama in here, oh yeah

[Chorus: Kodak Black & Juice WRLD]
Red bottom kicks, I feel like stompin' in here (Ya dig)
No oatmeal and grits, I'm eatin' codfish in here (Uh-huh)
New space coupe, feel like a martian in here (Yeah)
Fuck a protest, let's start a moshpit (Fuck a protest)
Red bottom kicks, I feel like stompin' in here (Ya dig)
No oatmeal and grits, I'm eatin' cod fish in here (Eating cod fish in here)
New space coupe, feel like a martian in here (Skrrt)
Fuck a protest, let's start a moshpit (Start a moshpit)

[Verse 2: Kodak Black]
Fuck a protest, let's start a fight in here
I just stepped up in the party, all my snipers here
I be rocking Tom Ford, poppin' Molly, though
Now I'm eatin' calamari, no more sloppy joe
Choke sandwich in my mansion, tryna save for dinner
I'ma start a moshpit in the Staples Center
All you niggas bitter, it's alright, though
Codeine in my liver, I'm sippin' hydro
I'm blowin' nitro, smokin' jetpack
Hatin' on a street nigga, can't respect that
I wanna jump out in a crowd, but I be scared to do it
'Cause if they pull on me the wrong way, I'ma go to shootin'

[Chorus: Kodak Black]
Yeah, red bottom kicks, I feel like stompin' in here
No oatmeal and grits, I'm eatin' codfish in here
New space coupe, feel like a martian in here (Yeah)
Fuck a protest, let's start a moshpit
Red bottom kicks, I feel like stompin' in here
No oatmeal and grits, I'm eatin' cod fish in here (Ayy)
New space coupe, feel like a martian in here
Fuck a protest, let's start a moshpit
