DeCicco, what up my nigga?
DeCicco

[Hook: GDo]
I took a dip in the sauce
To end up a boss
[?] losses
Ain't no debating the cause
I made it right to the cream
Benjamin Franky on me
Family hating on me
Plotting to take it from me
I took a dip, in the sauce
To end up a boss
Never settle for a loss
I made it right to the cream
Benjamin Franky on me
Family hate how I eat
Plotting to take it from me

[Verse 1: GDo]
Yes I did it again, I’m on a scorestreak
I went over and over again
She see that rover, and say she coming over again
I'm a high roller, we met like I dont know her again
Watch how I pull off the lot, dropping the top
[?] ain't the art, but yeah we good with the Pablo
Know what to do with the rocky, point at the fool and I pop
Im the plug, she the sidekick, thats why she steady shopping
Fuck her in the [?], its physical, I look like a miracle
[?] so Adidas, we got a check on my tennis shoe
How I’m rockin, I dont want no [?]
We never serve hits, buts thats always what I'm dropping
Took a dip when I drive my first whip
Got my first clip when I packed my first zip
I was taught to keep some franky on me
That's the only reason they hate on me

[Hook: GDo]
I took a dip in the sauce

Everybody hate [?] they just tryna take it from me
