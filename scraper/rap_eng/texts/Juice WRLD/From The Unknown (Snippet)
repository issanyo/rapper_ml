[Intro]
From the unknown, oh oh oh
I ran away I don't think I'm coming back home

[Chorus]
Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa
Like a cross space it's a dark place I roam
Ain't no right way just the wrong way I know
I problem solve with styrofoam
My world revolves around a black hole
The same black hole that's in place of my soul, uh
Empty, I feel so goddamn empty

[Verse 1]
I make a roll-

-with us in the hills, hills, hills
I don't have entity then and I still don't have any of these
Still, still, still
Being me I rock B&B
These hoes actin like god still-

-Oh my old me how they kill me slowly
Slowly I been gettin' no P's
OD, Feel like overdosing
