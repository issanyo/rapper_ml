[Intro]
Hooley
Let me tell you about a girl that I know
Her name holds too many titles
Let me tell you about a girl that I know
Her name holds too many titles
Sadness, Oppression, Anger, Aggression
Make a nigga go suicidal
(D-D-Danny Wolf)

[Chorus]
Ayy, Freezing in my agony, but shit is getting warm
She took me to hell, I ask her why
She say because
Love ain't meant for demons, baby
Love ain't meant for demons, baby
Freezing in my agony, but shit is getting warm
She took me to hell, I ask her why
She say because
Love ain't meant for demons, baby
Love ain't meant for us

[Verse 1]
Yeah, yeah
She whispers that in my ear
She made it crystal clear
That there ain't no love over here, here, here
Yeah, yeah
Told her put her hands in the air
She move a little too much for me
I'm scared that she ain't gon love with me
I'm scared that she ain't gon fuck with me, abundantly
She'll get sick of me, a month of me
Now I rot my brains in agony
Smoke a half a P, that's a blunt to me
God damn, feel like I woke up in hell, yeah
I wanna fuck on her hell, yeah
Please don't go there

[Chorus]
Freezing in my agony, but shit is getting warm
She took me to hell, I ask her why
She say because
Love ain't meant for demons, baby
Love ain't meant for demons, baby
Freezing in my agony, but shit is getting warm
She took me to hell, I ask her why
She say because
Love ain't meant for demons, baby
Love ain't meant for us

[Verse 2]
Ooh, ooh
Bust on her neck, get her in the mood
She gon' act like Satan in those Jimmy Choo's
WW, I can never lose
But when you split the W in half, you get two L's
One way ticket straight to hell
Smoke my demons, I inhale
When I'm in hell
Ooh, ooh
This is the end of my song
Now I got a hand over my soul
I won't let her go

[Chorus]
Ayy, Freezing in my agony, but shit is getting warm
She took me to hell, I ask her why
She say because
Love ain't meant for demons, baby
Love ain't meant for demons, baby
Freezing in my agony, but shit is getting warm
She took me to hell, I ask her why
She say because
Love ain't meant for demons, baby
Love ain't meant for us

[Outro]
Let me tell you about a girl that I know
Her name holds too many titles
Make a nigga go suicidal
