[Intro]
I smoke two blunts, I call that double dutch
Woah, oh, oh
Woah, oh, oh

[Chorus]
I'm on the money hunt, I'm on the money hunt
I got my hand on my Ruger
I be cooler than a cooler
VVS on me, no jeweler
Rolly with that new Franck Muller
Run up on me, I'ma shoot ya
Versace on me like Medusa
I got my hand on my Ruger, I got my hand on my Ruger

[Verse: 1]
I fuck yo bitch in my show, she hit me on the radio
She say she wanna do me slow, I said that I already know
Baby girl just hit my phone
I pop a xan and a half
Niggas won't leave me alone
I know that there's one more of me
These niggas some clones
These niggas some clones, these niggas some hoes
Fuckin' that bitch, I ain't takin it slow
Pop a molly then I'm losin' control
After I fuck her then she gotta go
She already know, they already know

[Chorus]
I'm on the money hunt, I'm on the money hunt
I got my hand on my Ruger
I be cooler than a cooler
VVS on me, no jeweler
Rolly with that new Franck Muller
Run up on me, I'ma shoot ya
Versace on me like Medusa
I got my hand on my Ruger, I got my hand on my Ruger

[Verse: 2]
Bitch I'm ballin, and shot callin
I want it, I got it
Run up on me and I pop it
I keep my gun in my pocket
Three thousand up in my wallet
I just may take yo bitch shoppin, I'm takin off like a rocket
Versace all up on my waist
I'm [?]
Run up on me, then I'm shootin, I'm doin' you in
Niggas be stealin my flow, same way I'm stealin' they hoes
Already know, fuckin' that bitch on the floor
Tell her come give me some more
Fuckin' that bitch in the room, in the kitchen whippin' dough
And then she put it in her nose
She said that she lovin' the blow, finna blow

[Bridge]
I smoke two blunts, I call that double dutch
Stack my money up, stack my money up
Came from a long way, goin' 90 on the highway
I'm on the money hunt, I'm on a money hunt

[Chorus]
I'm on the money hunt, I'm on the money hunt
I got my hand on my Ruger
I be cooler than a cooler
VVS on me, no jeweler
Rolly with that new Franck Muller
Run up on me, I'ma shoot ya
Versace on me like Medusa
I got my hand on my Ruger, I got my hand on my Ruger

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
I'm on the money hunt, I'm on the money hunt
I got my hand on my Ruger
I be cooler than a cooler
VVS on me, no jeweler
Rolly with that new Franck Muller
Run up on me, I'ma shoot ya
Versace on me like Medusa
I got my hand on my Ruger, I got my hand on my Ruger
