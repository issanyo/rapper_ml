[Hook:]
I need beans, I need lean, yeah the codeine
Ran up out of percs, so I'm taking morphine
We sit courtside she still catching nose bleeds
Fuck 12 [?] run it with the police
I take beans, with the lean, yeah the codeine aye
All these drugs got me dying baby slowly, aye
On the lowkey I be overdosing, aye
It ain't my fault that a nigga lonely, aye

[Bridge:]
All on my own
All on my own
Off the drugs I [?]
Far from my home

[Verse:]
Percy got me tweaking, I be tweaking
Caught my ex lurking, in my recents
Think that she a bad hoe, only decent
Lil bitch you look thirsty, here take this semen
I can't forget, wait drugs they make me forget thats how it is
Don't be swallowing my kids, hollow my tips
Can't go for that hater shit, pull up I'm hot
I be on that [?] shit

[Hook:]
I need beans, I need lean, yeah the codeine
Ran up out of percs, so I'm taking morphine
We sit courtside she still catching nose bleeds
Fuck 12 [?] run it with the police
I take beans, with the lean, yeah the codeine aye
All these drugs got me dying baby slowly, aye
On the lowkey I be overdosing, aye
It ain't my fault that a nigga lonely, aye
