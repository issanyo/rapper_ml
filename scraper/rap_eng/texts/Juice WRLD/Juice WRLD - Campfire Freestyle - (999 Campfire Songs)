Don't go to work baby call out
In the bed room aw awoe
Percs on the counter can't wait to take em
Blunts on the counter can't wait to face it
Bad little bitch yeah she be my favorite
All my songs they all on her playlist

I don't really now if she take it but she can take it
I don't really slow it down unless I'm in the matrix
Presidential brain that bitch like Sarah Palin

Thank god for it everyday Issa miracle
In the trap house singing negro spirituals

Pull up on them with the Rollie thats prefect timing

Guns sing like cece winans
Chain shit just like the climate
Sit back and my seat reclining

Im in another country getting new money
My money got depression yeah its blue money
Feeling like I got depression I was blue or something
Until I smoked a pack then I blew or something
Listen to the way I flow off this shit is off the top like a wave cap
Pull up to the scene and u getting knocked like a base bat
Put the Mac 11 bullet where ya fuckin face at
Eating good cocaine on a placemat
And thats where the bitch put her face at
Eating good cocaine on a placemat
And thats where the bitch put her face at
