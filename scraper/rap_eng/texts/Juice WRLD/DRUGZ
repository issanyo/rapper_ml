[Hook: King Jefe]
Drugs, drugs, I love my drugs
Pour up that mud, that shit got me stuck
Drugs, drugs, I love my drugs
I pop two xans and leave the land, I love my drugs
Drugs, drugs, I love my drugs

Drugs, drugs, I love my drugs
Drugs, drugs, I love my drugs

[Verse 1: King Jefe]
Drugs, damn, I love my drugs
I roll a blunt then spark it up, I can't get enough
Too much mud up in my cup that shit got me fucked
But bitch I can never damn lack I still got semi tucked
Trucks, love, what the fuck is that?
If that nigga got my money then we run up in his trap
Bitch I don't need nobody and you ain't even remember that
Bitch I am self made, I got my own fucking bag
