[Chorus]
Don't know what to think, when I think about you
But you okay
You like Dolce
Fuck me for this Dolce
Don't know what to think
Don't know what to think, when I'm thinking bout you
But you okay (yeah, uh huh)
Don't know what to think, when I think about you
But you okay
And you like Dolce
Fuck me for this Dolce

[Verse]
Elevate my mind, woah
Fucking on a thot, ow
Elevate her spine, then hit it from the back
I'm so high out my mind
That I don't know how to act
But I'ma keep pouring act right
Giving your bitch some act right, yeah
Then I leave that bitch in the past, wow
I know that I'm such a cash cow
I get the money then cash out
I take the percs till I pass out
Your bitch your memory and past now
I don't remember the past now
They don't want no smoke at all
Percocets, no Adderall
Tell your bitch knock it off
Just top me off
Pull up, the top is off
Drop the top on them hoes
Got yo thot she on the block, she givin top to the bros

[Chorus]
Don't know what to think, when I think about you
But you okay
You like Dolce
Fuck me for this Dolce
Don't know what to think
Don't know what to think, when I think about you
But you okay (yeah, uh huh)
Don't know what to think, when I think about you
But you okay
And you like Dolce
Fuck me for this Dolce
