[Intro]
I know one thing
I know one thing
I know one thing
Yeah, I know
Yeah, I know

[Chorus]
I just left her for my new thing, like a mood swing
Pull up in my two seat, with my new queen
Yeah I got a few queens, they my new things
They my new things
They confusing, but I know one thing
Imma get this money, I know one thing
Imma keep it comin', I know one thing
I know one thing

[Verse 1]
Yeah you say you got a bad hoe, wait
I got three of those, hey
Want my money 'lone, hey
So leave me alone
Why yo hoe just call my phone, hey
Say she comin' over
She gone' fuck me lone', hey
She ain't comin sober
Fuck your bitch like oh my god not again
Might as well have a Minaj in the Benz
She say she love me, but I don't think she understand
That Imma only break her heart in the end
I don't wanna have to let her go
Yeah she better than them other hoes
Put them Yeezys on her feet like what are those
Phillip Lahm from her head to her toes
I don't wanna have to let her go
Yeah she better than them other hoes
Put them Yeezys on her feet like what are those
Phillip Lahm from her head to her toes

[Chorus]
I just left her for my new thing, like a mood swing
Pull up in my two seat, with my new queen
Yeah I got a few queens, they my new things
They my new things
They confusing, but I know one thing
Imma get this money, I know one thing
Imma keep it comin', I know one thing
I know one thing

[Verse 2]
Yeah I know
I know it's hard to love me when you know my heart is cold
I know its hard to trust me when im fucking on these hoes
But I don't wanna lose and I don't wanna choose
So I just fuck em' all

Hey if you a bad bitch fuck em' all
You ain't talkin' money then I cut you off
No more Mr. nice guy not at all, not at all, not at all
Sorry, but I had to let her go

I was busy fucking other hoes
I put them Yeezys on my feet like what are those
Phillp Lahm from my head to my toes

[Chorus]
I just left her for my new thing, like a mood swing
Pull up in my two seat, with my new queen
