[Chorus: Corbyn Besson & Jack Avery]
I still see your shadows in my room
Can't take back the love that I gave you
It's to the point where I love and I hate you
And I cannot change you, so I must replace you, oh
Easier said than done, I thought you were the one
Listenin' to my heart instead of my head
You found another one, but I am the better one
I won't let you forget me

[Chorus: Zach Herron, Jonah Marais]
I still see your shadows in my room
Can't take back the love that I gave you
It's to the point where I love and I hate you
And I cannot change you, so I must replace you, oh
Easier said than done, I thought you were the one
Listenin' to my heart instead of my head
You found another one, but I am the better one
I won't let you forget me

[Verse: Daniel Seavey, Jonah Marais & Corbyn Besson]
You left me falling and landing inside my grave
I know that you want me dead
I take prescriptions to make me feel a-okay
I know it's all in my head
I have these lucid dreams where I can't move a thing
Thinking of you in my bed
You were my everything
Thoughts of a wedding ring
Now I'm just better off dead
I'll do it over again
I didn't want it to end
I watch it blow in the wind
I should've listened to my friends
Did it all in the past, but I want it to last
You were made outta plastic, fake (fake)
I was tangled up in your drastic ways (tangled up in your drastic ways)
Who knew evil girls had the prettiest face?
You gave me a heart that was full of mistakes
I gave you my heart and you made heart break

[Bridge: All, Zach Herron & Daniel Seavey]
You made my heart break
You made my heart ache
You made my heart break
You made my heart ache (ooh ooh)
You made my heart break
You made my heart ache (oh no)
You made my heart break again

[Outro: Corbyn Besson]
I still see your shadows in my room
Can't take back the love that I gave you
