[Intro]
Aye
Hey

Hey

[Chorus]
I treat this shit just like my dick I'm goin hard
That's your boyfriend he could barley keep a job
And I don't fuck with niggas I just fuck they broads
And I don't talk to hoes bitch I talk to god
Set your boyfriend up I bet his ass get robbed
I got the head and then I pass it to my slime
They ask me how i'm doin' bitch I'm feelin fine
They ask me what i'm doin bitch I'm in my prime

[Verse 1]
Tony Hawk bitch yeah I'm on my grind
She wanna suck me up thats a waste of time
He tried to set me up but I had the 9
He tried to wet me up at least a nigga tried
He say he real well you know the nigga lied
How he real when he can't even work a 9 to 5
You ain't in no trap you still stay at yo mama house
You ain't shoot no Glock you still got super soakers out
You's a little boy, better grow up
Better move around, you don't know us
Dumbin through a check, new money
I might cash that goddamn all these blue hunnids yeah

[Chorus]
I treat this shit just like my dick I'm goin hard
That's your boyfriend he could barley keep a job
And I don't fuck with niggas I just fuck they broads
And I don't talk to hoes bitch I talk to god
Set your boyfriend up I bet his ass get robbed
I got the head and then I pass it to my slime
They ask me how i'm doin' bitch I'm feelin fine
They ask me what i'm doin bitch I'm in my prime

[Verse 2]
Bitch I said I'm in my prime you better take a seat
All these niggas tryna ball but never make the team
You don't make no money all you do is make believe
And Imma keep that shit 100 that's a major key
She gone work for me, she gone pop a perc for me
She gone lurk for me, she gone do my dirt for me
I got nine shots, three of y'all get three a piece
I been through it all just to say the least
Couldn't sleep last night had to pour the lean
Activist out the seal cost a couple g's
I don't wanna pop a pill imma make a scene
And I don't want your fucking heart I'm married to the green

[Chorus]
I treat this shit just like my dick I'm goin hard
That's your boyfriend he could barley keep a job
And I don't fuck with niggas I just fuck they broads
And I don't talk to hoes bitch I talk to god
Set your boyfriend up I bet his ass get robbed
I got the head and then I pass it to my slime
They ask me how i'm doin' bitch I'm feelin fine
They ask me what i'm doin bitch I'm in my prime

[Outro]
Bitch i'm in my prime
She wanna suck me up that's a waste of time
Told that bitch i'm in my prime
She wanna suck me up that's a waste of time
Lurk for me
She gone pop a perc for me
Do my dirt for me
She gone work for me
Aye
This shit was sick
