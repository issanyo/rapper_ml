(Chorus)
(Yeah) She do coke while I sip codeine
Rap game, crack game, serve it to the dope fiend
She like court side, still catchin' nosebleed
9-1-1, this bitch boutta OD
Passed out on my couch, someone take her out
Medics in n' out, tellin' her "breathe in n' out"
Neighbors nosier than a bitch, askin' me what this about?
Shorty took too many drugs, tryna overdose for clout

(Verse 1)
Molly on her tongue got her goin' dumb
She older than me, she know that I'm young, but I'm not young and dumb
Fuck a bitch, get a bitch sprung
Pull up onna scene, they run
I pull out my gun, heater on me
Kinda like the sun, bitch I'm not the one
Fuck wit me, choppa give you smoke like a chimney
Jiminy cricket, how they jumpin' on my wave, B
It's crazy, now I'm makin' money onna daily
I'd be hatin' on me too, if I wasn't gettin' paid
I'd be hatin' on me too, if I wasn't gettin' laid (uh)
On a daily basis, on a daily basis
Presidential brain from your main, Sarah Palin
Tryna judge a nigga, you don't even got a bailiff

(Chorus)
She do coke while I sip codeine
Rap game, crack game, serve it to the dope fiend
She like court side, still catchin' nosebleed
9-1-1, this bitch boutta OD
Passed out on my couch, someone take her out
Medics in and out, tellin' her "breathe in and out"
Neighbors nosier than a bitch, askin' me "what this about?"
Shorty took too many drugs, tryna overdose for clout

(Instrumental break)

(Chorus)
She do coke while I sip codeine
Rap game, crack game, serve it to the dope fiend
She like court side, still catchin' nosebleed
9-1-1, this bitch boutta OD
Passed out on my couch, someone take her out
Medics in and out, tellin' her "breathe in and out"
Neighbors nosier than a bitch, askin' me "what this about?"
Shorty took too many drugs, tryna overdose for clout
