[Intro]
Man, what?
This shit funny
I was like, this hennessy strong as fuck boy

[Chorus]
She told me put my heart in the bag
And nobody gets hurt
Now I'm running from her love, I'm not fast
So I'm making it worse
Now I'm digging up a grave from my past
I'm a whole different person
It's a gift and a curse
But I cannot reverse it

[Verse 1]
I can't reverse it
It was a gift and a curse
And now I'm drinking too much so I'ma talk with a slur
Last time I saw you it ended in a blur
I woke up in a hearse
You said you love me first
One thing my dad told me was "Never let your woman know when you're insecure"
So I put Gucci on the fur
And I put my wrist on iceberg
One thing my heart tells me is "Flex on a hoe every time you're insecure"
I guess you came through
I'm running from you
Is your love for real?
Is your love really true?

[Chorus]
She told me put my heart in the bag
And nobody gets hurt
Now I'm running from her love, I'm not fast
So I'm making it worse
Now I'm digging up a grave from my past
I'm a whole different person
It's a gift and a curse
But I cannot reverse it

[Bridge]
You gave me the run around
I really hate the run around
You really got me paranoid
I always keep a gun around
You always give me butterflies
When you come around
When you come around
When you come around

[Verse 2]
You let me know love is not the answer
Not the answer, not the answer
I love to do drugs so mind my manners
I get high when you don't decide to answer
Phone home, I need to phone home
I'm throwing rocks at your window, I need to go home
I don't wanna leave
I just wanna be with you
You, you, you

[Chorus]
She told me put my heart in the bag
And nobody gets hurt
Now I'm running from her love, I'm not fast
So I'm making it worse
Now I'm digging up a grave from my past
I'm a whole different person
It's a gift and a curse
But I cannot reverse it
