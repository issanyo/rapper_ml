[Hook]
Sometimes Sometimes Sometimes
Sometimes Sometimes Sometimes
Sometimes Sometimes Sometimes
I wanna be by my lonely
I pop these Percs by my lonely
I put in work by my lonely
40 on me you know that's my homie
I wanna be by my lonely
I take these Percs by my lonely
I put in work by my lonely
40 on me you know that's my homie

[Bridge]
My mind sometimes
Gets dark and wild
My mind sometimes
I don't want to be bothered

...

[Verse]
...Breathing just got a lil harder
I mean well, I mean well
Alls well that ends well
Inhale, exhale
Losing my sanity probably
I'll see you in hell, yeah
Ima meet you there
As i'm letting my demons they bother me
When I'm sleeping they sittin' on top of me
And wherever I go they'll follow me
I fell into the pit and it's bottomless
There goes my soul, but it isn't my property
Try and take it from me, demonic robbery
Crazy the way the Devil will lie to me

[Bridge]
Just leave me alone
I could do better on my own
I get on high on my ass on my own
[?]
But if she don't love me no more
[?]

[Hook]
Sometimes Sometimes Sometimes
Sometimes Sometimes Sometimes
Sometimes Sometimes Sometimes
I wanna be by my lonely
I pop these Percs by my lonely
I put in work by my lonely
40 on me you know that's my homie
I wanna be by my lonely
I take these Percs by my lonely
I put in work by my lonely
40 on me you know that's my homie

[Outro]
There ain't no place like home
I wanna go back home
I hate the world we know
There ain't no place like home
I wanna go back home
I hate the world we know
