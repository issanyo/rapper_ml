Machete
Cut em' to pieces
In pieces
Hope this perc beatin' me
Barely breathe, huh
I'm high off the finest lean
I feel like I'm an eagle
You think you a bitch, aha
Imma put a bullet hole in your ego
God damn, I love my straps
But no, I don't fuck with these people
Bitch Imma pit off the leash
Got yo hoe gassed up
Still fucked her on e, oh yeah
We been through [?]
Ain't even keeps the receipts
Ran in the game, no cleats
All this green it clicks

Walk in the room with like a 100G's
Fuck nigga say he'd take my watch, nigga please
Fucks on the internet shoot his Glock, nigga please
All my guns got a cold, I'm gone' em' sneeze
[?]
