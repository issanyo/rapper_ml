(Hook)
She do coke while I sip codeine
Rap game, crack game, servin to the dope feinds
She like court side, still catch a nosebleed
911 this bitch bout to O.D
Passed out on my couch
Someone take her out
Medics in and out, tellin her breath in and out
Neighbors nosey then a bitch, askin me what this about
Shawty took too many drugs tryna overdose for clout

(Verse)
Molly on her tongue
Got her goin dumb
She older than me
She know that I’m young
But I’m not young and dumb
Fuck a bitch get a bitch sprung
Pull up on the scene they run
I pull out my gun
Heat on me, kinda like the sun
Bitch I’m not the one
Fuck with me
Choppa get you smoked like a chimney
Jimmeny
Cricket how they jumpin on my wavey
It’s crazy
Now I’m makin money on the daily
I’d be hatin on me too if I wasn’t gettin paid
I’d be hatin on me too if I wasn’t gettin laid
On a daily basis (x2)
Presidential brain from your main Sarah Palin
Tryna judge a nigga you don’t even got a bae look

(Hook x3)
She do coke while I sip codeine
Rap game, crack game, servin to the dope feinds
She like court side, still catch a nosebleed
911 this bitch bout to O.D
Passed out on my couch
Someone take her out
Medics in and out, tellin her breath in and out
Neighbors nosey then a bitch, askin me what this about
Shawty took too many drugs tryna overdose for clout
