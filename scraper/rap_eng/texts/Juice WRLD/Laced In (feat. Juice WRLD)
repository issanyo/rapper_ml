[Intro]
Cash Money AP
Cash AP got the beat tight

[Chorus]
They told me that I got a way with words
But couldn't get away with my heart
She told me she gon' kick me to the curb
But I've been on the curb from the start
I've been takin' drugs to the face, yeah
If I run out, call the plug for replacements
In the basement, takin' pills til' I'm shakin'
Fixations, rich drugs I'm laced in

[Verse}
I've been on the curb from the start
Thinkin' bout the girl that stole my heart
I've been mixin' weed with the codeine
I've been waiting for this for like so long
Got me mixed up, all my feelings washed up
Threw me in the dryer now she put me on the cycle
Waiting, wishin' that I never even started
Girl, you are the reason that my heart became so harden

[Chorus]
They told me that I got a way with words
But couldn't get away with my heart
She told me she gon' kick me to the curb
But I've been on the curb from the start
I've been takin' drugs to the face, yeah
If I run out, call the plug for replacements
In the basement, takin' pills til' I'm shakin'
Fixations, rich drugs I'm laced in

[Verse]
Rich drugs I'm laced in
Looking at the top, hope I make it
I've been on my real shit, no faking
Hit the bulls-eye, you know where I'm aiming
Pop a pill, now you're round my mind, on my sight
Sober up, see you again, then I fill my cup
How did I get here?
Where does this road end?
Maybe in another time I'll see you again

[Chorus]
They told me that I got a way with words
But couldn't get away with my heart
She told me she gon' kick me to the curb
But I've been on the curb from the start
I've been takin' drugs to the face, yeah
If I run out, call the plug for replacements
In the basement, takin' pills til' I'm shakin'
Fixations, rich drugs I'm laced in

[Verse]
I'm just smokin' on chronic
Poppin' these pills, rockin' my designer
My insides hurt, but my outside's flawless
Fresh to death, like I'm out a coffin
Bitch it's Deja Vu, I done seen it before
I, wonder if you don't love me no more
Too many pills, now I'm down on the floor
I woke up wanting some more
I woke up crying for more

[Chorus]
They told me that I got a way with words
But couldn't get away with my heart
She told me she gon' kick me to the curb
But I've been on the curb from the start
I've been takin' drugs to the face, yeah
If I run out, call the plug for replacements
In the basement, takin' pills til' I'm shakin'
Fixations, rich drugs I'm laced in
