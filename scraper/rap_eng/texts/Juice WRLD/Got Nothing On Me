[Chorus]
Young, young nigga but I'm bummin' like a double OG
Fuck one barrel, got a double on me
I got backpack cash, keep a duffel on me
And I'm on the shrooms, keep the truffles on me
Your boyfriend ain't got nothing on me
Got nothing on me, got nothing on me
Your boyfriend ain't got nothing on me
Got nothing on me, got nothing on me
Your boyfriend ain't got nothing on me
Got nothing on me, got nothing on me
Your boyfriend ain't got nothing on me
Got nothing on me, got nothing on me

[Verse 1]
Ooh, more drip than a typhoon
And I got a way with words, Doc Seuss
And I always keep some killers in the room
Make the tool go "ooh"
VVS Jewels, go "ooh"
Shine like a gold tooth
I'm the new ting
You're the old news
Red bottom drippin', like a Pyru
Bet your man can't do what I was gon' do
Girl you better pick a side, it's him or I
Go on and leave him sick inside, Need an MRI
She know I've been gettin' high, see it in my eyes
Avoid the lows, ayy
Pop pills with my bros, ayy
Hide the blues, in the back, so they don't see
And check the Gucci, they forgot to check the Dolce
Vision blurry, still drive, I'ma be straight
Pullin' up early to the cash, I won't be late

[Chorus]
Bummin' like a double OG
Fuck one barrel, got a double on me
I got backpack cash, keep a duffel on me
And I'm on the shrooms, keep the truffles on me
Your boyfriend ain't got nothing on me
Got nothing on me, got nothing on me
Your boyfriend ain't got nothing on me
Got nothing on me, got nothing on me

[Verse 2]
Stunt so damn hard, I ain't even notice she was standin' there
I don't even know about you, but shit, it feel like I'm the man in here
WIth that choppa, I'm a hot boy
Got a fan in here
On the corner of your block boy, like a thot boy
They hit your potato head, turn to tater tots boy
I'm a grown kid, used to loan that kids bop, boy
Hung up on yo bitch, if she hit me back, tell her my phone died
Really I was talkin' to a bitch I met on the north side
I'm so confused, yeah I'm super high
I ask all the girls, I'm a super guy
Get my heart away, such a stupid guy
Still I ball so hard, I don't even try

[Chorus]
Bummin' like a double OG
Fuck one barrel, got a double on me
I got backpack cash, keep a duffel on me
And I'm on the shrooms, keep the truffles on me
Your boyfriend ain't got nothing on me
Got nothing on me, got nothing on me
Your boyfriend ain't got nothing on me
Got nothing on me, got nothing on me
Your boyfriend ain't got nothing on me
Got nothing on me, got nothing on me
Your boyfriend ain't got nothing on me
Got nothing on me, got nothing on me
But I'm bummin' like a double OG
Fuck one barrel, got a double on me
I got backpack cash, keep a duffel on me
And I'm on the shrooms, keep the truffles on me
Your boyfriend ain't got nothing on me
Got nothing on me, got nothing on me
Your boyfriend ain't got nothing on me
Got nothing on me, got nothing on me
