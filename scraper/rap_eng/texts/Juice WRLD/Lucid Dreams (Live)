[Intro]
I still see them

[Chorus]
I still see your shadows in my room
Can't take back the love that I gave you
It's to the point where I love and I hate you
I cannot change you, I must replace you
Easier said than done, I thought you were the one
Listenin' to my heart instead of my head
You found another one, but I am the better one
I won't let you forget me
I still see your shadows in my room
Can't take back the love that I gave you
It's to the point where I love and I hate you
I cannot change you, I must replace you
Easier said than done, I thought you were the one
Listenin' to my heart instead of my head
You found another one, but I am the better one

[Verse]
You left me falling and landing inside my grave
I know that you want me dead
I take prescriptions to make me feel a-okay
But it's all in my head
I have these lucid dreams where I can't move a thing
Thinking of you in my bed
You were my everything
Thoughts of a wedding ring
But now I'm just better off dead
I'll do it over again
Didn't want it to end
Watch it blow in the wind
Should've listened to my friends
Leave this shit in the past, but I wanted to last
You were made outta plastic, fake, ho
Tangled up in your drastic ways
Who knew evil girls had the prettiest face?

[Chorus]
I still see your shadows in my room
Can't take back the love that I gave you
It's to the point where I love and I hate you
I cannot change you, I must replace
Easier said than done, I thought you were the one
Listenin' to my heart instead of my head
You found another one, but I am the better one
I won't let you forget me-e
I still see your shadows in my room
Can't take back the love that I gave you
It's to the point where I love and I hate you
I cannot change you, I must replace you
Easier said than done, I thought you were the one
Listenin' to my heart instead of my head
You found another one, but I am the better one
I won't let you forget me-e

[Outro]
Yeah, yeah
I won't let you forget me-e
Yeah, yeah
I won't let you forget me-e
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I won't let you forget me-e-e-e-e-e-e-e
Hey
La-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
