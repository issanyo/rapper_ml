[Chorus]
I hopped out my bag, bitch I'm in my bag
Revenge on my bag, get the last laugh
Choppa in my bag, like it's Afghan
I'm cranky as hell, I just took my last xan
That bitch eating white pills like she Pacman
High as fuck, swinging through them trees like I'm Tarzan
Bi as fuck, she gon' fuck on me then her best friend
Bruce Wayne, I'm in all black like I'm Batman

[Verse 1 Juice WRLD]
Hit the curb, put it in reverse, yeah I had to swerve
Fuckin' with my green, I'ma shoot
Feel like Larry Bird
I know that my fans are the youth, they feel every word
Feel like superman in the booth, going ham in the booth
R-E-V-E-N-G-E on my body
Bad bitch say she gon' ride like a Kawasaki
All this ice
Choppa hockey stick, but I ain't playing hockey
Feel like Stevie Wonder, right
I can't see nobody, right
In that ghost like Poltergeist
Way she ride this dick, she treat it like a motorbike
After I get my nut, I tell her that it's over right (Yeah It's over right)
Then I hit my plug for that lean, sip it over ice

[Verse 2 lil flow]

Lil flow
Bitch what's in my bag
Bitch you already know
I ain't go nowhere without my fucking dope
I ain't go nowhere without my fucking gang
Lil flow, I'm just out here doing my thang
Pulling up civic, speeding, yeah and switching lanes
It'll come round like a boomerang
Those pills you popping look like ying and yang (They fake)
I got caught up in the rain
Throw your contract in the drain
Choppa leave you fucking sprained
Know I keep a candy cane
Yeah you're talking shit about me
Let me guess you're out of money
Let me guess you're out of money
