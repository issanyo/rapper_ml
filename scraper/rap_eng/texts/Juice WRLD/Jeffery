[Intro]
Money on me, hunnid on me (Hunnid)
Money on me, (Hunnid, Hunnid)
Money on me, (Ay)
Hunnid on me (Hunnid, Hunnid)
(Woah, Ay, Brrp, Brrp, Brrp, Skrrt)

[Chorus]
Money on me, hunnid on me
Bro gon' catch a body, then he flee the scene
I still put the G-Star on my jeans
She ask me if I love her, only in her dreams
Keep my stick on me, make you bleed
Would have never shot you if you let me be
Young Rich Nigga, that's a guarantee
I be with a killer, like Jeffery

[Verse: 1]
No Dahmer, I'm a problem
You a goon cool, I got goblins
Fuck with me, make you leak like a faucet
Mix the liquor up, skrt now I'm nauseous
I don't sip the lean, used to love codeine cause I love to dream
Now mix henny with the remmy, cause I love to drink
And I don't love to think
Feel like I'm finna puke
Can't do it on the mink, me
Money on the way, what is the, hold up, hold up
I can't drive, still hit a donut
Nineteen, multi-millionaire
Ain't no lookin' back, all that broke shit there

[Chorus]
Money on me, hunnid on me
Bro gon' catch a body, then he flee the scene
I still put the G-Star on my jeans
She ask me if I love her, only in her dreams
Keep my stick on me, make you bleed
Would have never shot you if you let me be
Young Rich Nigga, that's a guarantee
Ugly, but I'm killer like Jeffery

[Verse: 2]
I get drunk and act a fool
If you want a altercation, put you on the news
With the channel crew
They know I be makin' moves
W Gang, I can't ever lose, like your boyfriend
I can never be a fool, like your boyfriend
He a bitch, nigga I went to school with your boyfriend
Real as hell, I came from my move like your boyfriend
Next thing you know, she want me to be her boyfriend
That's how that shit go, she do coke, I gotta make it snow
Pull up with the pole, like who want smoke
LOL to the bank, richer than a joke

[Chorus]
Money on me, hunnid on me
Bro gon' catch a body, then he flee the scene
I still put the G-Star on my jeans
She ask me if I love her, only in her dreams
Keep my stick on me, make you bleed
Would have never shot you if you let me be
Young Rich Nigga, that's a guarantee
Ugly, but I'm killer like Jeffery
