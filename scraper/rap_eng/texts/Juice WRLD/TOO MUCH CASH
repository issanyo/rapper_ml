[Intro]
Yeah, too much cash
Yeah, can't fit in my pockets

[Chorus]
Startet with a quarter then I turn it to a half
I was boolin with ya baby momma in the trap
He was talking shit, so we caught him on a ave
Imma woop his ass, beat him like his dad
Fuckin' on a slut you know Imma dick her down
I'ma fuckin' slut, she know Imma get around
Molly in the water, Imma drink it till I drown
Baby I'm a dog, baby I'm a fucking hound

[Bridge]
Too much cash, can't fit in my pockets
Goyard bag, I don't need a wallet
She's so bad, I needed her number, huh
I give her pipe like a plumber, huh
After I fuck her I pawn her

[Verse 1]
I know why you mad (why you mad)
No you ain't gettin' no money
Hatin' on me but you broke and you bummy
Fuckin' your hoe put my dick in her tummy
Go-go with a stick, gun on your lip
Up in that choppa, you know that she runnin'
I wear that Gucci, you wear Abercrombie
Poppin' the xannies I feel like a zombie
Hold up, wait a minute
Let me put some money in it
Drive by, windows tinted
Pull up on you, sloppy finish
Serve up, call it tennis
You could catch me while the whip in
Grow up, robbin' niggas
Now I just go shoppin' with 'em

[Bridge]
Too much cash, can't fit in my pockets
Goyard bag, I don't need a wallet
She's so bad, I needed her number
I needed her number
I needed her number

[Chorus]
Startet with a quarter then I turn it to a half
I was boolin with ya baby momma in the trap
He was talking shit, so we caught him on a ave
Imma woop his ass, beat him like his dad
Fuckin' on a slut you know Imma dick her down
I'ma fuckin' slut, she know Imma get around
Molly in the water, Imma drink it till I drown
Baby I'm a dog, baby I'm a fucking hound

[Verse 2]
Baby I'm a dog, I'm a dog in my whip
Drivin' like it stolen, I be swervin' my shit
I-I get what I want, cause I deserve and shit
She gon' fuck me and my team, cause we perfect and shit, ay
Imma pull up in a new whip
Imma go fuck on a new bitch
Niggas they know how I do it
Run up on me then I shoot shit
My choppa lookin' like a pool stick
Niggas faker than allusions
I had my mind and then I lose it
I fucked a bitch and then she clueless

[Bridge]
Too much cash, I gotta have it
Talkin' smash, I up automatic
Saw my guys, we ridin' in traffic, huh
Niggas they don't want no static, huh
This'll dissapear like it's magic, yeah

[Outro]
(turn into a half)
Too much cash
