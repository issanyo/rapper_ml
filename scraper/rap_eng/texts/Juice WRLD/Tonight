[Intro]
M-M-M-Murda

[Chorus: Juice WRLD]
Are you feeling yourself tonight?
Do you feel like yourself tonight?
Do you wanna talk about it?
Or put it up on the shelf tonight?
We got a lot to bite into
Good thing I got overbite
Good thing my love over nice
You put my heart over ice, right
But I don't feel like myself tonight
Take a pill off my shelf tonight
I think that I may melt tonight
No, I don't feel alright, over high
Too much hate, over drive

[Verse 1: Valee & Juice WRLD]
Live on a Sunday, I think God want me to do that
Squeeze in a lunch date with your boo, might be what I wanna do
My shoes cost 3 racks, can't use tissues 'cause I'm removin' the scuffs
Adderall too potent, it takes too, yeah, yeah
These brand new Balenci's, I don't do layaway
And these hoes suckin' me up, day to day
And she know I'm not gon' let her stay today
She can't stay here, dumb bitch, you can't stay here
I'm in a straight A, still took too long, but I'm not missin' no exes
My bitch in a 2 door mini X, don't got more than two Xs
We keep a gun on us, it feel like they let us
Drippin' with no problem, like somebody wet us

[Chorus: Juice WRLD]
Are you feeling yourself tonight?
Do you feel like yourself tonight?
Do you wanna talk about it?
Or put it up on the shelf tonight?
We got a lot to bite into
Good thing I got overbite
Good thing my love over nice
You put my heart over ice, right
But I don't feel like myself tonight
Take a pill off my shelf tonight
I think that I may melt tonight
No, I don't feel alright, over high
Too much hate, over drive

[Verse 2: Juice WRLD]
Hmm, knew it wasn't love
Didn't know what it was
Thought you were on drugs
You say that I am, don't say shit, I shrug
Who am I to judge? Who am I to judge?
Who am I gon' love with you gone? Like uh
This shit got me feelin' all alone like no
It's to the point where I would want to hit your phone
Emotional, unavailable

[Chorus: Juice WRLD]
Are you feeling yourself tonight?
Do you feel like yourself tonight?
Do you wanna talk about it?
Or put it up on the shelf tonight?
We got a lot to bite into
Good thing I got overbite
Good thing my love over nice
You put my heart over ice, right
But I don't feel like myself tonight
Take a pill off my shelf tonight
I think that I may melt tonight
No, I don't feel alright, over high
Too much hate, over drive
