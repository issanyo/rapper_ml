Baby keep that on the low though (on the low, the low, the low)
Bands on me got more dope (cash)
I'm a dragon boy you a Komodo (you know what i mean)
Pose, life's a photo
Pull up on the scene with my bros (gang)
Runnin' through the 6 like my woes, Drake (head)
Pockets fat, look like Ricky Rosay (head)
Money on deck baby, okay (rich)
