[Chorus]
Let's play a game, big bank, take a lil' bank
Let's play a game, sniper, I got range
She play games, she hyper, she love cocaine
She gimmie brain, I like it
I got the touch like Midas
She wanna fuck, I might
I'm full off of food, got the Itis
It's been a long day, I'm tired
But I made it ride like a bike
I told her her friends are invited
Fuck 'em off codeine, I tried it
Ask if you think I'm lying

[Verse]
Just give me a stage and a mic
I bet I turn into Mike
I beat it up like I'm Ike-right
I beat it up like I'm Ike
VVS, shit like a night-light
But you niggas ain't that bright
Your bitch wanna fuck
Lucky for you, she ain't my type
Young nigga come in a fight, right
But I get the pipe right
Green bean, money like limelight
Shoot when the time's right
Bad bitch say that she only like girls
What would she do for a Klondike?
Hit it from the back in the back of a Bentley truck
While she eat a blonde dyke

[Bridge]
You dig? (brain)
You dig? (nah, keep that shit)
You dig?
You dig? (ya dig?)

[Chorus]
Let's play a game, big bank, take a lil' bank
Let's play a game, sniper, I got range
She play games, she hyper, she love cocaine
She gimmie brain, I like it
I got the touch like Midas
She wanna fuck, I might
I'm full off of food, got the itis
It's been a long day, I'm tired
But I made it ride like a bike
I told her her friends are invited
Fuck 'em off codeine, I tried it
Ask if you think I'm lying

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
Let's play a game, big bank, take a lil' bank
Let's play a game, sniper, I got range
She play games, she hyper, she love cocaine
She gimmie brain, I like it
I got the touch like Midas
She wanna fuck, I might
I'm full off of food, got the itis
It's been a long day, I'm tired
But I made it ride like a bike
I told her her friends are invited
Fuck 'em off codeine, I tried it
Ask if you think I'm lying
