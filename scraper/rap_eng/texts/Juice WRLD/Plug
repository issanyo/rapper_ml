[Intro]
I found out that love was a drug
Now I need to look for a plug
I found out that love was a drug
Now I need to look for a plug

[Hook]
I found out that love was a drug
Now I need to look for a plug
Yeah I met her right in the club
Like a cold, love
I found out that love was a drug
Now I need to look for a plug
Put my heart under the rug
No one got to know
No one got to know
Heartbreak, heartbreak, just another hole
Cupid keep on knockin' at my door

[Verse 1]
Imma let em in, ooh
Bad hoes, Imma let em in, too
Ballin' hard, like a letterman, ooh
You got me intoxicated, all the things that you do
Always had these complications when I'm lovin' on you
Yeah, I care about your heart, you should, too
You be tearin' me apart, like you do
And I told you from the start, I love you


[Hook]
I found out that love was a drug
Now I need to look for a plug
Yeah I met her right in the club
Like a cold, love
I found out that love was a drug
Now I need to look for a plug
Put my heart under the rug
No one got to know
Everybody knows, bitch you gotta go
Cause I said, so
Said, so

[Verse 2]
Laid up in the casket, thought it was your mattress
First we made love, then you made me die
You gave me your heart, and I know that it was plastic. Fake!
Everything comes back to Lucid Dreams
Next thing you know, you hurt me
I'm just tryna keep it on the lowkey
Pour a cup of Hennessy, my stomach turnin'
Feel it in my chest, straight burning
Feel it in my chest, straight working
Mix it with a perky, now I'm slurring
I'ma fuck a bad bitch, come from Germany
She be tryna judge a nigga, can't tell me

[Hook]
I found out that love was a drug
Now I need to look for a plug
Yeah I met her right in the club
Like a cold, love
I found out that love was a drug
Now I need to look for a plug
Put my heart under the rug
No one got to know
