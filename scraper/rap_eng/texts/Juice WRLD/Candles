[Intro]
I don't know if it's because my heart hurts or if I'm insecure
I'm not sure
(Yeah, I like that)
Uh

[Chorus]
Yeah, I'm not sure
I don't know if it's because my heart hurts or if I'm insecure
Baby, you're not her
My last girl had me so fucked up, it was a blacked out blur
Baby, you jump first
It's a long way to hell, I ain't really tryna leave this Earth
Baby, do your worst
I've come to the conclusion you can't kill me if I kill you first

[Verse 1]
I've been through the wringer
Tryna put a diamond ring on her finger
She love drama, she be watching Jerry Springer
Next thing you know, we all on Jerry Springer
I play love games, but no, I'm not a cheater
She hate it when I sip codeine, I'm a leaner
The devil on my shoulder keep on telling me to keep her
Should I take her out or should I take her to the cleaner?
Love don't end good for me, no good for me
She's good for me, too good
These hoes love playing me, heartbreaking me
Don't pray for me, just give me drugs

[Bridge]
Just give me drugs
Just bring me drugs
Just give me drugs
Just bring me drugs
Just give me drugs

[Chorus]
Yeah, I'm not sure
I don't know if it's because my heart hurts or if I'm insecure
Baby, you're not her
My last girl had me so fucked up, it was a blacked out blur
Baby, you jump first
It's a long way to hell, I ain't really tryna leave this Earth
Baby, do your worst
I've come to the conclusion you can't kill me if I kill you first

[Verse 2]
I told her, "Run around and get away"
I think I need a getaway
I need to call a timeout, I need to set another play
I need a umbrella 'cause every day feels like a rainy day
I need something other than Xannies to take the pain away
I ran away to California, I'm tryna cut corners
Satan bossing me around but you know I don't take orders
Yeah, I had to move around, I was starting to feel cornered
Starting to feel cornered, I can't see the front door
Starting to feel cornered, starting to feel slaughtered
Started to not give a fuck, screaming out "Why bother?"
My ex-bitch too bad, my next bitch way hotter
We met in a car crash, she ride it like full throttle

[Chorus]
I'm not sure
I don't know if it's because my heart hurts or if I'm insecure
Baby, you're not her
My last girl had me so fucked up, it was a blacked out blur
Baby, you jump first
It's a long way to hell, I ain't really tryna leave this Earth
Baby, do your worst
I've come to the conclusion you can't kill me if I kill you first
