Teased At Concert

[Intro]
We turn this bitch up for the culture (Oh)
Lost my composure
I lost my composure, I lost my composure (Yeah)
I lost my composure, I lost my composure
Hide 'til it's over and there'll be time for this

[Chorus]
Count the winnings (Yeah), fuck about your feelings (Yeah)
Get to these millions (Yeah), fuck about your feelings (Yeah)
Duck these bitches (Yeah), fuck about your feelings (Yeah)
And don't forget to get high (Yeah), live life with no ceilings (Yeah)
Get high to get by (Yeah), watch my friends die (Yeah)
See 'em in the distance (Yeah), you gotta be kidding (Yeah)
Gettin' high to get by (Yeah), watch my friends die (Yeah)
See 'em in the distance (Uh), you gotta be kidding (Uh)

[Verse]
The world's getting colder, friends die young
No believe in older, they all die young
My heartbeat is slower, codeine sipper
No, I'm not a poser, I'm a power tripper, yeah
I got so high that I might never come back, yeah
We ran the train to get her on the right track, yeah
That's your bitch? Nigga, how do you like that?
Don't worry 'bout her, we'll send her right back

[Pre-Chorus]
Just got that colder, the world on my shoulders
I keep my composure just to find something [?], yeah

[Chorus]
Count the winnings (Yeah), fuck about your feelings (Yeah)
Get to these millions (Yeah), fuck about your feelings (Yeah)
Duck these bitches (Yeah), fuck about your feelings (Yeah)
And don't forget to get high (Yeah), live life with no ceilings (Yeah)
Get high to get by (Yeah), watch my friends die (Yeah)
See 'em in the distance (Yeah), you gotta be kidding (Yeah)
Gettin' high to get by (Yeah), watch my friends die (Yeah)
See 'em in the distance (Uh), you gotta be kidding (Uh)
