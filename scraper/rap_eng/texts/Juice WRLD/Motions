[Chorus: Juice WRLD]
I think I'm hooked on emotions (yeah)
I'm in too deep like the ocean (yeah)
I know I'm lost in the moments (yeah)
Baby I do not condone this (yeah)
But I've been drinkin' and smokin' (yeah)
You think it's funny, I'm jokin' (yeah)
But I'm so serious, without you I am delirious, yeah
I think I'm hooked on emotions (yeah)
I'm in too deep like the ocean (yeah)
I know I'm lost in the moments (yeah)
Baby I do not condone this (yeah)
But I've been drinkin' and smokin' (yeah)
You think it's funny, I'm jokin' (yeah)
But I'm so serious, without you I am delirious, yeah

[Verse 1: Juice WRLD]
I put my heart in the backpack
Packin' my shit up to leave
No I won't look back
Drama be lookin' for me
Baby where you at?
That's where I wanna be
That's where I wanna be, yeah
Let's go to lunch we can eat there
Got a hotel we can sleep there
I'm only sleeping if you're there
Girl I'm so happy that you care
Runnin' my fingers through your hair
Ready for love, I am not scared
But I'll be scared if I open my eyes and you not there (yeah, hell yeah)

[Chorus: Juice WRLD]
I think I'm hooked on emotions (yeah)
I'm in too deep like the ocean (yeah)
I know I'm lost in the moments (yeah)
Baby I do not condone this (yeah)
But I've been drinkin' and smokin' (yeah)
You think it's funny, I'm jokin' (yeah)
But I'm so serious, without you I am delirious, yeah
I think I'm hooked on emotions (yeah)
I'm in too deep like the ocean (yeah)
I know I'm lost in the moments (yeah)
Baby I do not condone this (yeah)
But I've been drinkin' and smokin' (yeah)
You think it's funny, I'm jokin' (yeah)
But I'm so serious, without you I am delirious, yeah

[Verse 2: Madeintyo]
I really want you next to me
Fuckin' you, givin' you what's left of me
God keep blessin me
Give me good head, stop stressin' me
[?] sauce, with the recipe
Bad bitch on me
Why you gotta stress me
Why you gotta stress me
Over seas, yeah with a bad one
Wanna get your hair done
CDG on my hoodie
Baby on me, what's goodie
Got a couple plaques on the wall
Bank account fat, never fall
Put it on the line for you
With that song with Juice

[Chorus: Juice WRLD]
I think I'm hooked on emotions (yeah)
I'm in too deep like the ocean (yeah)
I know I'm lost in the moments (yeah)
Baby I do not condone this (yeah)
But I've been drinkin' and smokin' (yeah)
You think it's funny, I'm jokin' (yeah)
But I'm so serious, without you I am delirious, yeah
I think I'm hooked on emotions (yeah)
I'm in too deep like the ocean (yeah)
I know I'm lost in the moments (yeah)
Baby I do not condone this (yeah)
But I've been drinkin' and smokin' (yeah)
You think it's funny, I'm jokin' (yeah)
But I'm so serious, without you I am delirious, yeah
