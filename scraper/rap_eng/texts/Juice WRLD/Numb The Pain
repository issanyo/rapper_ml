[Chorus]
I've been feelin' needy, this love shit ain't easy
You've been all on my mind, I've been barely breathin'
Had a panic attack, I thought you were leavin'
And I thought you blocked me, text message turn green
Damnit, had to OD, tryna numb the pain
You was in my hotel room, finna run away
Prolly gonna slit my wrists if I don't see you every day
I think I'm obsessed, girl there's gotta be a better way

[Verse]
I'm willin' to die for this shit, suicide love
I'm too high for this shit, doin' my drugs
If you ever leave, they gon' find me in a pool of my blood
That should tell you how much I love ya
Would you ever die for this, my suicide love?
You're too high for this, she took all of my drugs
Now I'm in a trance, off the xans, tryna double my cup
So much for bein' sober
If we break up, that's a bad dream, I won't wake up from
Back to the sadness, and sleepin' by my lonesome
Wait, it feel like I'm bout to throw up
Sit down, stay awhile, girl don't say that it's over

[Chorus]
I've been feelin' needy, this love shit ain't easy
You've been all on my mind, I've been barely breathin'
Had a panic attack, I thought you were leavin'
And I thought you blocked me, text message turn green
Damnit, had to OD, tryna numb the pain
You was in my hotel room, finna run away
Prolly gonna slit my wrists if I don't see you every day
I think I'm obsessed, girl there's gotta be a better way

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
I've been feelin' needy, this love shit ain't easy
You've been all on my mind, I've been barely breathin'
Had a panic attack, I thought you were leavin'
And I thought you, text message turn green
Damnit, had to OD, tryna numb the pain
You was in my hotel room, finna run away
Prolly gonna slit my wrists if I don't see you every day
I think I'm obsessed, girl there's gotta be a better way
