[Lyrics From Snippet]
From the unknown, whoa whoa whoa whoa
I ran away, I don't think I'm coming bick home, whoa whoa
Whoa whoa whoa whoa
Like a cross space, it's a dark place I roam
Ain't no right way, just the wrong way I know
I problem solve with styrofoam
My world revolves around a blackhole
The same blackhole that's in place of my soul, uh
Empty, I feel so goddamn empty
I make a roll-

-us with the hills, hills, hills
I don't have entity then and I still don't have any of these still, still, still
Uh, Being me, I rock
B&B, these hoes
Actin' like, god still
D-

Moshpit, squishing me
On my old me
How they, kill me slowly
Lowly, I've been gettin' no Ps
OD, feel like overdosing
Low-
