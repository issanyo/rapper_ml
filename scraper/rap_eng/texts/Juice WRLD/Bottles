[Intro]
Whoa, drownin' in a Hennessy bottle
Oh-oh-oh, yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
Drownin' in a Hennessy bottle (bottle)
New .45 filled with hollows (hollows)
She says she got a new boyfriend
Well he won't live to see tomorrow (tomorrow)
Drownin' in a Hennessy bottle (bottle)
New .45 filled with hollows (hollows)
She says she got a new boyfriend
But he won't live to see tomorrow (tomorrow)

[Verse 1]
She says she got a new boyfriend (whoa)
My heart's still hurtin' (whoa)
Girl, is it worth it? (whoa)
I'm a whole different person (whoa)
You're a girl and a serpent (whoa)
Yeah, I am certain (whoa)
You say you wanna play (whoa)
It's time to close the curtains (whoa)
Show's over (whoa)
Pull up in a 'Rari or a Rover (skrrt skrrt)
Call me anything except its sober (whoa)
I invite your best friend over (whoa)
Fuck her until she fall into a coma (whoa)
Drugs got me roamin' (whoa)
Feeling like I'm back with the Romans
Ooh, 'cause I fuck her with the Trojans
Yeah, she loves me like Makonnen

[Chorus]
Drownin' in a Hennessy bottle (bottle)
New .45 filled with hollows (hollows)
She says she got a new boyfriend
Well he won't live to see tomorrow (tomorrow)
Drownin' in a Hennessy bottle (bottle)
New .45 filled with hollows (hollows)
She says she got a new boyfriend
But he won't live to see tomorrow (tomorrow)

[Verse 2]
Drink 'til they drown (yeah, yeah)
She make me frown (yeah, yeah)
She let me down (yeah, yeah)
She let me down (yeah, yeah)
Jumpin' in a Hennessy bottle (bottle)
Told her if she suck me, then swallow (swallow)
New .45 filled with hollows (hollows)
Put her man right after sorrow (sorrow)
Remember we was boolin' in the crib
Playing Grand Theft Auto
I was trying to show you how I live
Like Grand Theft Auto

[Bridge]
Ohh, ohh, ohh
Yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
Drownin' in a Hennessy bottle (bottle)
New .45 filled with hollows (hollows)
She says she got a new boyfriend
Well he won't live to see tomorrow (tomorrow)
Drownin' in a Hennessy bottle (bottle)
New .45 filled with hollows (hollows)
She says she got a new boyfriend
But he won't live to see tomorrow (tomorrow)
