[Intro]
Why you mad, why you mad?
Why you mad, why you mad?
That is all I wanna know
You're lookin' like a joke, dry humor at the most
Steady chokin' on your shade like a dick in your throat
Well if you're gonna throw shade my way
Maybe you should throw with a little more aim
It's a cold day in hell when they dirty up your name
They don't got no business talkin' in the first place, I'm freezin'
(Freezin', bitch I'm freezin', freezin', freezin', freezin', freezin')

[Chorus]
All these fuck niggas on my line
Damn nigga you must wanna die tonight
Yeah, I rock a choker with a .45
And I know some niggas that are down to ride
All these hatin' bitches on my line
Damn bitch you must wanna fuck tonight
Let me guess, you're my biggest fan, right?
You wanted an autograph
All you had to do was ask, woah (Huh)

[Verse 1]
But you lookin' like an asshole
Up on twitter and you lookin mad, woah
Talkin' bout me, but you lookin' bad, woah
Like the ugly daughter that I never had, woah
And what's up with these niggas?
Got my name in they mouth like they swallowin' my children
I never got why niggas hate
It's probably cause I'm doin' better than them anyway
It's probably cause I get they bitches wetter anyway
It's probably cause I'm livin' and they're in a lower place
They walkin' in the slums while I'm vibin' out in space
Crash land just to take they girl on a dinner date
When haters see me winnin' they just hyperventilate
They always try to stop me but I never hesitate
Just follow all your dreams and when you reach them, celebrate
That's the only way to truly make a hater suffocate

[Chorus]
All these fuck niggas on my line
Damn nigga you must wanna die tonight
Yeah, I rock a choker with a .45
And I know some niggas that are down to ride
All these hatin' bitches on my line
Damn bitch you must wanna fuck tonight
Let me guess, you're my biggest fan, right?
You wanted an autograph
All you had to do was ask, woah

[Verse 2]
Why you mad, why you mad?
Why you mad, why you mad?
That's all I wanna know
You're lookin' like a joke, dry humor at the most
Steady chokin' on your shade like a dick in your throat
Well if you're gonna throw shade my way
Maybe you should throw with a little more aim
It's a cold day in hell when they dirty up your name
They don't got no business talkin' in the first place, I'm freezin'
But these haters not breathin'
Stevie Wonder to these haters no seein'
And I don't believe it
They hate me, hate me for no reason
They hate me for no reason, woah
Oh-oh-oh

[Chorus]
All these fuck niggas on my line
Damn nigga you must wanna die tonight
Yeah, I rock a choker with a .45
And I know some niggas that are down to ride
All these hatin' bitches on my line
Damn bitch you must wanna fuck tonight
Let me guess, you're my biggest fan, right?
You wanted an autograph
All you had to do was ask, woah
