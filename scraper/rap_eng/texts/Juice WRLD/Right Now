[Intro]
What, aye bitch
Slow Down
Going dumb
Coolin' with my dogs
Yeah we're on drugs

[Chorus]
Right now
She say I'm a dog, bitch I bite down
I be with my dogs, bitch we bite down
Please don't run up, got it on me right now
Please don't run up, got it on me right now
She say I'm a dog, bitch I bite down
I be with my dogs, bitch we bite down
Please don't run up, got it on me right now
Please don't run up, got it on me right now

[Verse 1]
Bitch right now
Mike Tyson, KO with the lights out
Take your bitch out, all the way out
Laid out baby, case you stay out
I don't got time for the cake house
I'm too busy runnin' on the cake route
Bitch I'm royalty, you better bow down
Run up, that's okay I got it on me right now
I got it on me, but I'm still by my lonely
That's yo bitch if she want me
She just want my Givenchy

[Chorus]
Right now
She say I'm a dog, bitch I bite down
I be with my dogs, bitch we bite down
Please don't run up, got it on me right now
Please don't run up, got it on me right now
She say I'm a dog, bitch I bite down
I be with my dogs, bitch we bite down
Please don't run up, got it on me right now
Please don't run up, got it on me right now

[Verse 2]
Bitch right now
Mike Tyson, KO with the lights out
Take your bitch out, all the way out
Laid out baby, case you stay out
I don't got time for the cake house
I'm too busy runnin' on the cake route
Bitch I'm royalty, you better bow down
Run up, that's okay I got it on me right now
I got it on me, but I'm still by my lonely
That's yo bitch if she want me
She just want my Givenchy

[Chorus]
Right now
She say I'm a dog, bitch I bite down
I be with my dogs, bitch we bite down
Please don't run up, got it on me right now
Please don't run up, got it on me right now
She say I'm a dog, bitch I bite down
I be with my dogs, bitch we bite down
Please don't run up, got it on me right now
Please don't run up, got it on me right now
