(mumbling) Fall down
I ain't finna fall down
Fourth quarter, shorty, I'mma a ball out
Don't go to work, baby call out
Ain't no waitin', no stall now
I'm finna ball out
Fourth quarter, shorty, no call outs
Don't go to work, baby, just call out
(uh) In the bedroom, all out
Percs on the counter
I can't wait to take 'em
Blunts on the counter
Can't wait to face it
Bad lil' bitch, yeah
She be my favorite
All my songs, they all on her playlists
I don't really know how to say it but I'mma say it
I don't really know if she take it but she could take it
I don't slow it down unless I'm in the matrix
Presidential brain that bitch like Sarah Palin
Here it go
I'm not the same nigga that I was a year ago
I thank God every day for this, a miracle
In the Trap House singing mingles, spirituals (yeah)
Aunt Jemima, best believe I'm in trap, goin' entry lining
Pull up on 'em with the Rollie, that's perfect timing
I guess that means that the stars aligning
Gonna sing like CeCe Winans
Changed shit just like the climate
Sit back in my seat reclining
I call that shit perfect timing
I'm in another country getting new money
My money act depression, yeah that's blue money
Feeling like I had depression, I was blue or something
Until I smoked a pack and then I blew or something
Listen to the way that, I flow on this shit is off the top, like a wave cap
Pull up on the scene you get knocked like the bass back
Put the Mac-11 bullet where your fucking face at
Eating good cocaine on a placemat
And that's what a bitch put her face at
Eating good cocaine on a placemat
And that's what a bitch put her face at
