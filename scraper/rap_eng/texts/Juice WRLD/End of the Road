[Chorus]
This is as far as it goes
This the end of the road
This the end of the rope
The other end at her throat
It's suicidal she wrote
This is the end of the show, it's over
We doin' drugs 'til we in a coma

[Verse 1]
We don't love these hoes, our hearts got colder
It's hard out here for a lonely stoner
I know I'm doin' drugs, but so what?
Just pray to God I never throw up
I pray to God my plug I pour up
I pray to God my plug still show up
I know the last time, we tried to rob him
He lucky, bro'nem ain't fucking off him
I'm drinking, driving in the Bentley coupe
So it's hard for me to drive, I move too slow
I told you, baby, I ain't saving no hoe
I only save the money, antihero
I burned my old clothes and got some new clothes
I left my old hoes and got some new hoes
My brother got a chopper and it's kickin' like judo
He shootin' while I'm drivin' the two-door

[Chorus]
This is as far as it goes
This the end of the road
This the end of the rope
The other end of the throat
It's suicidal she wrote
This is the end of the show, it's over
We doin' drugs 'til we in a coma
This is as far as it goes
This the end of the road
This the end of the rope
The other end at her throat
It's suicidal she wrote
This is the end of the show, it's over
We doin' drugs 'til we in a coma

[Verse 2]
I'm smokin' dope 'til I'm in a coma
The moon rock on me, I love the aroma
I get so high that I'm in the clouds with the fallen angels
Demons with halos
She love the coke, but not Coca-Cola
But she'll still pop it like a soda for ya
Her name rings bells like a Motorola
I lay the bitch off like I'm her employer
And she gon' ride like a roller coaster
And I'm gon' hide when the love is over
But it's far from over, losing composure
In a coffin, laying stiff like a boulder

[Chorus]
This is as far as it goes
This the end of the road
This the end of the rope
The other end of the throat
It's suicidal she wrote
This is the end of the show, it's over
We doin' drugs 'til we in a coma
This is as far as it goes
This the end of the road
This the end of the rope
The other end at her throat
It's suicidal she wrote
This is the end of the show, it's over
We doin' drugs 'til we in a coma
