[Intro]
She'll kill me if she heard it (kill me if she heard it)
Aye bitch you kill me
She’ll kill me if she heard I was poppin' ecstasy
She'll kill me if she heard I was poppin’ ecstasy
[Verse 1]
She'll kill me if she heard I was poppin' ecstasy
Or a fat mean Madison but I been stressin' out
Imma blame it on the government yeah it's the men again
They treat us niggas just like manikins we just get tossed around
Even when a nigga president they still gon' fuck around
Bein' sober is an understatement but it's overrated
I’m smokin’ 'till my eyes are bleedin’ and my head is blazin'
I'm poppin' till my hands are shakin’ and my heart is racin' yeah
I need molly molly molly let's get wasted yeah (yeah)
I felt the temperature drop I hear what you sayin' and I understand
I get it I get it I know I should stop, I need a way to get back to the top
I need a way to get outta this slump
I need a way to get way out and stay out and build up a layout to fuck up the world
I go political for the publicity imma get ignorant just for the industry
I get chaotic to match all the chaos and imma get radical just for my enemies
Fuck it I'm fucked up I know it I know it
Lookin' like what in the fuck's gotten into me
I said the hennesy mixed with the remmies the remedy
Look at your boy doin' chemistry
[Refrain}
This shit is so fuckin' sick
Change the world type shit
Screamin' fuck everything you feel me
You gotta live your life like, like it's yours ya feel me
Don't give a fuck about nothin' bro just do you
[Chorus]
Imma turn up till I can't do it no more
Imma fuck her till I can't do it no more
This is real life this is not a promo
Imma fuck the world up nigga let's go
Nigga let's go, nigga let's go
We gon' fuck the world up nigga let's go
Nigga let's go, nigga let's go
We gon' fuck the world nigga let's go
[Verse 2]
Perfect I'm gon' pop a percocet
Imma pour me up some purple shit to find some perfectness
I mean all these niggas clowns take 'em to the circuses
And I swear this case is closed like the fuckin' curtains is
That nigga said I don't play but you be on your actin' shit
I got brothas movin' packages and poppin' Xe mints
Want that work they give it to you ain't no fuckin' estimate
I been shittin' shittin' shittin' on 'em hear my excrement, yeah
[Chorus]
Imma turn up till I can't do it no more
Imma fuck her till I can't do it no more
This is real life this is not a promo
Imma fuck the world up nigga let's go
Nigga let's go, nigga let's go
We gon' fuck the world up nigga let's go
Nigga let's go, nigga let's go
We gon' fuck the world nigga let's go
