[Intro: Juice Wrld, Shiloh Dynasty]
Tell me why I'm waiting for someone
That couldn't give a fuck about me
Like I don't wanna talk about it, yeah, well look
No, no, you wouldn't...
Taylor 'bout to fuckin' flex

[Verse]
I was in the cut with a AK
Caught a nigga lackin' on the same day
Run up in his trap, that's a vacate
Turned his mom house to a danger place
God damn, on my danger zone
Fuck your bitch, that's why I'm on my own
President, feel like Obama on
Ks and shit, that's that Osama, whoa, ay
Ayy, they wonder why I rap like this
I'm off the xans, and the Hen, and the gin, damn
They wonder why I act like this
And, why I talk my crap like this?
Yeah, why I tote my strap like this?
Yeah, I feel like Santa in Christmas time
Three hoes in my lap, like shit
Yeah, huh, ayy, they call me the radio
I fuck yo' bitch, that's yo' wifey? Well I call her a crazy hoe
I got a black bitch, a white bitch, a black bitch, I call that a Oreo
I see the future like a fortune teller, they call me a oracle
I feel like Jesus, call out to Jesus, fuck her like miracles
