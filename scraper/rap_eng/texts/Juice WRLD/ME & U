[intro]
I tripped and almost crashed
I tripped and almost crashed
Into you
I’m into you
You got me soaring

[Chorus]
Woah
Yeah, I’m falling through the skies you got me soaring
Your my dream girl, I can’t ignore it
I was running away from love so fast
And then I tripped and almost crashed
Into you
Yeah, I’m into you
It’s just me, oh
What to do, what to do

[Verse 1]
Hypnotized by her eyes, girl you got me hung
For love I’m going dumb
Your name all on my mind
You’re in my head
Let’s go for a drive yeah the night is young
These words are on my tongue
I'm xanning
I’m forgetting what I said
I can’t forget, the first time when I saw your face
Like damn I wanna see that girl again
And I can’t forget, the first time when I called your name
Like damn I wanna say her name again

[Pre-Chorus]
Falling through the skies you got me soaring
I tripped and almost crashed
Into you

[Chorus]
Woah
Yeah, I’m falling through the skies you got me soaring
You’re my dream girl I can’t ignore it
I was running away from love so fast
And then I tripped and almost crashed
Into you
Yeah, I’m into you
It’s just me, oh
What to do, what to do

[Verse 2]
From your eyes
To your smilie
To your face
To your name
To the way that you say what you say
I’m okay, just a little bit, crazy over you
Take out time out my day, just to say anything
That’ll bring a little smile to your face
Okay, okay
I’m really crazy over you
Aye, I admit it (I admit it)
I admit it (I admit it)
I admit it (I admit it)
I admit it (I admit it)
I admit it (I admit it)
I’m crazy over you
And I can’t forget, the first time when I saw your face
God damn I done fell in love again
And I can’t forget, that all my love just fades away
But I won’t let the shit get out of hand

[Pre-Chorus]
You got me soaring
I tripped and almost crashed
Into you

[Chorus]
Woah
Yeah, I’m falling through the skies you got me soaring
You’re my dream girl I can’t ignore it
I was running away from love so fast
And then I tripped and almost crashed
Into you
Yeah, I’m into you
It’s just me, oh
What to do, what to do
