[Intro]
Holding your hand, taking a chance
Holding your hand, and taking a chance (yeah)
I'm not holding your hand, I'm not taking a chance
I won't say it again, I won't say it again
Ran out of drugs I feel like

[Hook]
Ran out of drugs, I feel like it's the end
I'm on a bench
You say you love me, I'm not holding your hand
You say you love me, I'm not holding your hand
Ran out of drugs, I feel like it's the end
I'm on a bench
You say you love me, I'm not holding your hand
You say you love me, I'm not holding your hand

[Verse]
Time will tell, time will tell
I can do bad all by myself
I feel too cold, and lonely
Drugs my only, homie
Fuck my life up, why don't you
I don't trust, I don't want to
I found love, but drugs found me first

[Bridge]
They told me it wouldn't hurt me
They told me not to worry
But that's what I get for talking to the pills, no benefits
They told me it wouldn't hurt me
They told me not to worry
But that's what I get for talking to the pills, no benefits

[Hook]
Ran out of drugs, I feel like it's the end
I'm on a bench
You say you love me, I'm not holding your hand
You say you love me, I'm not holding your hand
Ran out of drugs, I feel like it's the end
I'm on a bench
You say you love me, I'm not holding your hand
You say you love me, I'm not holding your hand

[Bridge]
They told me it wouldn't hurt me
They told me not to worry
But that's what I get for talking to the pills, no benefits
They told me it wouldn't hurt me
They told me not to worry
But that's what I get for talking to the pills, no benefits
