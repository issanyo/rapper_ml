[Chorus]
Feel like I ran out of peace, yeah
I don't know what's happenin' to me, yeah
Burnin' up 500 degrees, yeah
I always thought to love them and leave them, yeah
I ran out of the peace, yeah
I don't know what's happenin' to me, yeah
I always thought to love them and leave them
I always thought to love them and leave them, yeah

[Verse]
She makes it cold, without no snow
Girl I know you came a little to close
To take my soul away from me
You pray on love, and play for keeps
Girl you gon' regret the day you let go
Hunnid racks on the floor, nowadays there's more for me
I ball so hard, think I need a trophy
Watch her block my shot, hoe you not a goaly
Heard she love my style
Take a number, sit in line, wait awhile (hey)
I heard that she love me cause I'm wild (hey)
Ballin' think I need a timeout, get a triple-double now I'm out

[Chorus]
Feel like I ran out of peace, yeah
I don't know what's happenin' to me, yeah
Burnin' up 500 degrees, yeah
I always thought to love them and leave them, yeah
I ran out of the peace, yeah
I don't know what's happenin' to me, yeah
I always thought to love them and leave them
I always thought to love them and leave them, yeah

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
Feel like I ran out of peace, yeah
I don't know what's happenin' to me, yeah
Burnin' up 500 degrees, yeah
I always thought to love them and leave them, yeah
I ran out of the peace, yeah
I don't know what's happenin' to me, yeah
I always thought to love them and leave them
I always thought to love them and leave them, yeah
