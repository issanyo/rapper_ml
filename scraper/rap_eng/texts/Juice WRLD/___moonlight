[Intro]
Enviyon on the mix

[Chorus]
Girl, you know I'm far from perfect, I won't lead you on
But tonight is feelin' perfect, this your favorite song
I know that mood right
I know that mood right, oh
Dance in the moonlight
Dance in the moonlight, oh
Dance in the moonlight, oh
Dance in the moonlight, oh
Dance in the moonlight
Dance in the moonlight, oh
Dance in the moonlight, oh
Dance in the moonlight, oh, oh, oh
Dance in the moonlight, oh

[Verse 1]
Don't know when I met you but I met you
Don't know why I love you but I love you, oh
It's something 'bout that dress, the way it fit you
I don't even wanna tell you to take it off but baby take it off
We in this party on Molly, no time for monologue
She say I'm Kevin Hart funny so she gon' ride along
She say she came in with endurance so she gon' do me all night long
We could dance in the moonlight, oh
She got a man, I told him come to the moonlight brawl
Don't stand a chance
Don't stand a chance in the moonlight, oh
We throw them hands
We throw them hands in the moonlight, oh

[Bridge]
I'm in love with the moonlight, ah
Make love in the moonlight, oh
I've been myself since birth, nigga
Ain't nothin' like y'all
I'm in love with the moonlight
Make love in the moonlight, oh
I've been myself since birth, nigga
Ain't nothin' like y'all

[Chorus]
Girl, you know I'm far from perfect, I won't lead you on
But tonight is feelin' perfect, this your favorite song
I know that mood right
I know that mood right, oh
Dance in the moonlight
Dance in the moonlight, oh
Dance in the moonlight, oh
Dance in the moonlight, oh
Dance in the moonlight
Dance in the moonlight, oh
Dance in the moonlight, oh
Dance in the moonlight, oh, oh, oh, oh
Dance in the moonlight, oh

[Verse 2]
Girl, you know I'm far from perfect
But I'm really worth it
She say that I'm pretty
I'm prettier in person
I'm drivin' her crazy, you know I'm really swervin'
I'm cuttin' too deep, I'm feelin' like a surgeon

[Chorus]
Girl, you know I'm far from perfect, I won't lead you on
But tonight is feelin' perfect, this your favorite song
I know that mood right
I know that mood right, oh
Dance in the moonlight
Dance in the moonlight, oh
Dance in the moonlight, oh
Dance in the moonlight, oh
Dance in the moonlight
Dance in the moonlight, oh
Dance in the moonlight, oh
Dance in the moonlight, oh, oh, oaoh
Dance in the moonlight, oh
