[Chorus]
Yeah, I hate to say it but I fell in love again
We needed a vacation, so we took a trip to France
I just spent $2000 on a shirt and a pair of pants
If you niggas couldn't tell, I'm never goin' broke again
I love poppin' Percocets, my baby love the Xans
Had to cuff her up, can't do that single shit again
I really love her style, but I really hate her friends
They'll be hating outside the club when they can't even get in

[Verse 1] [Juice WRLD}
Look at me now like Chris Brown
I'm a king, that's my queen, better bow down
All the hoes on my line 'cause I'm up now, yeah
Come through when she's not around, yeah
I'm just playing, bae, you know I'm here to stay
This is real love, I ain't here to play
I need real drugs, not the fake Perks, but the real ones
I remember I was caught up in my feelings
All these women starting to look like evil villains
Baby, you're a hero, you're so different
Had to put the drug talk down for a minute
Listen, this bitch got me tripping

[Chorus]
Yeah, I hate to say it but I fell in love again
We needed a vacation, so we took a trip to France
I just spent $2000 on a shirt and a pair of pants
If you niggas couldn't tell, I'm never going broke again
I love poppin' Percocets, my baby love the Xans
Had to cuff her up, can't do that single shit again
I really love her style, but I really hate her friends
They'll be hating outside the club when they can't even get in

[Verse 2] [Ft. Lil Vamp}
Baby, yeah I'm broke down
I fall to the ground, I need you around
Way to bonded
Rollin' off a perky feeling nauseous
Ah shit, Pop to many I'm not using caution
Lost it, on another planet think I've lost it
Im outraged, Let out some aggression need a moshpit
Way to high i don't ever wanna come down
You're way too hot burning up like the sun out
All up on my mind, Yeah its hard to forget know
Need you all the time, if you leave me then I'm dead now
{Baby won't you stay}



[Chorus]
Yeah, I hate to say it but I fell in love again
We needed a vacation, so we took a trip to France
I just spent $2000 on a shirt and a pair of pants
If you niggas couldn't tell, I'm never going broke again
I love poppin' Percocets, my baby love the Xans
Had to cuff her up, can't do that single shit again
I really love her style, but I really hate her friends
They'll be hating outside the club when they can't even get in
