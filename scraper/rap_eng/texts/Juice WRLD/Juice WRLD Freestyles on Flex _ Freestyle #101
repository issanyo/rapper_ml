[Intro]
Uh-huh, uh-huh
Man, man, man, man
Uh

[Verse]
On these beats, I feel like I'm a murderer
Who are these niggas? Who are y'all, have I heard of 'em?
Who am I? I'm a murderer, uh
Niggas always on a sneak diss murmuring, uh
I ain't really got no time for the chit-chat, bitch get back
This choppa break pussies in half, Kit-Kat
Run up on me that's cool, up the choppa out the mismatch
Designer that you can't afford, uh
Hop out a foreign, these up niggas in a Ford
Yo' bitch like a car, yeah, that bitch a whore, uh
A four-door, huh, yeah, yeah, yeah
Presidents like 'more, yeah, yeah, yeah
I feel like I'm the best at what I do, I swear it
Pull up on the scene, that blood, you gon' wear it
Brains get the tearin', all that fallin', ballin'
Bron on the Lakers like spalding, damn
This is how I play
Me and G-Money gamblin' over 2K, that's 10K
Yo' advance, not 2K
Off the top with the freestyles no tupe
I kick push work in my city like Lupe
That bitch don't cross the street, yeah she go both ways
My choppa shoot 'em four times, that's foreplay
Make you ring like a single finger, no Beyoncé
Man, it's 3K for the wrist, André
Just to fly out a bitch from the islands, Bombay
I do me all night and all day, dawg
Run up on me than that choppa gon' spray, dawg
I'm not a XBOX, no I won't play, dawg
That shit dead like your people's in the graveyard
No offense, nah fuck that; all offense
Police come through, I'm out the trap, I hopped the fence, uh
Man, I do this everyday though
In the cut, like I kill people nigga, Tadoe
World in my hands, I'ma mold it like Play-Doh
Full of shit, hell yeah, rich ass A-Hole
A-Hole on the a-list
Fuckin' all the bitches on the a-list that you ain't even see yet
I'm meeting in all the legends, that all these goofy ass peasants, didn't even get to meet yet
They askin' for features
I'm shittin' on my exes, these niggas and my teachers
You pull up that's okay
Remember in school when we caught yo' ass lackin' and we jumped you by the bleachers
That's a true ass story
Yeah, I got kicked out
Fuck the bitch in the porta potty, my dick out
I'm on the scene goin' crazy, runnin' sick routes
I had to bring that shit out, man
I'm exposin' these niggas
I don't take breaks from raps, no reloading, lil' nigga
My clip on infinity, shootin' up yo' lil vincinity
I get Duff Clinton, lil' money like my name Hillary
I feel like a pastor, the triple 9 is the ministry
Nigga they be pussy like a menstrual bleed
