Count the winnings
Fuck up out your feelings
Get to the millions
Fuck up out your feelings
Dog these bitches
And don't forget to get high
Live life with no ceilings
Gettin' high to get by
Watch my friends die
See em in the distance
You got to be kidding
Gettin' high to get by
Watch my friends die
See em in the distance
You got to be kidding



The worlds getting colder
When friends die younger
Believe in older, they all die young
My heart beat is slower, codeine sipper
No I'm not a poser, I'ma power tripper
Yeah, I get so high I ain't ever coming back
Yeah, ran a train to get her on the right track
Yeah, That's your bitch nigga, how do you like that
Don't worry about it, we'll send her right back


Just got that colder
The world on my shoulders
I keep my composer
Just to find something closer


Count the winnings
Fuck up out your feelings
Get to the millions
Fuck up out your feelings
Dog these bitches
And don't forget to get high
Live life with no ceilings
Gettin' high to get by
Watch my friends die
See em in the distance
You got to be kidding
Gettin' high to get by
Watch my friends die
See em in the distance
You got to be kidding

Niggas gonna be.....
