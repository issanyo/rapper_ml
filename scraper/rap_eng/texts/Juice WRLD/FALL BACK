[Intro]
Need a flight overnight to Paris and all that
She text me saying that it's over in all caps
It's gnarly

[Chorus]
Need a flight overnight to Paris and all that
She text me saying that it's over in all caps
Now I'm taking xanny with a perky it's all bad
Damn love burns like a furnace so fall back
Need a flight overnight to Paris and all that
She text me saying that it's over in all caps
Now I'm taking xanny with a perky it's all bad
Damn love burns like a furnace so fall back

[Verse 1]
Last night I had my first show it was too rad
Even though I only made a 100 in all cash
Whole crowd jumping to my music and all that
Rockstar status baby that's what you call that
How come when I call baby you never call back
Heartbreak hotel that's what you call that
You got a new one and I'm all sad
I got hoes but they're nothing but fall backs
I take drugs just so I can not feel bad
Already dead so the mission accomplished

[Bridge]
I'm already dead so the mission accomplished
I hope that you feel bad

[Chorus]
Need a flight overnight to Paris and all that
She text me saying that it's over in all caps
Now I'm taking xanny with a perky it's all bad
Damn love burns like a furnace so fall back
Need a flight overnight to Paris and all that
She text me saying that it's over in all caps
Now I'm taking xanny with a perky it's all bad
Damn love burns like a furnace so fall back

[Verse 2]
Flexing on my ex's and I'm starting to feel bad
Xanny with a perky and a molly it's too bad
Rockstar status baby I'm feeling to rad
I just made my ex girl too sad
I know that you feel that
That's my ambition baby you'll never kill that
Cupid tried to get me baby I told him get back
I'm ballin' on these niggas a mismatch
I know that you feel that
You're so fake you don't know where the real at

[Bridge]
Thats my ambition baby you'll never kill that
I know that you feel that
You're so fake, I know that you feel that

[Chorus]
Need a flight overnight to Paris and all that
She text me saying that it's over in all caps
