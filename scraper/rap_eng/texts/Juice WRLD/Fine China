[Intro: Future & Juice WRLD]
The world on drugs
Ten (Yeah) thousand dollar plates
Thousand dollar plates
Thousand dollar plates, fine china
Shorty like a, uh
Shorty like a
(Wheezy outta here)

[Chorus: Juice WRLD]
Shorty like a thousand dollar plate, fine china
Tell her that she beautiful every day, I remind her
Then I jump in the pussy like a lake, I'm a diver
And her last man was a pussy, had a vagina
I get lost in her eyes, like dust from the skies
It's her body or nobody, I refuse to compromise
So if she leaves, I'ma kill her, oh, she'll die
Did I say that out loud? I'm so crazy about mine

[Verse 1: Juice WRLD]
Goin' insane, feel you pickin' up and movin' things inside my brain
I know I don't have to argue about everything
But we don't have the same soul
Went and sold drugs 'til we got a bigger bankroll
Tell me that you love me, baby, say it again
Repeat it over and over until it's in my brain
Picked up the drugs so I let my brain go
Woulda fried yours too, but I'm selfish about my Percs, oh

[Chorus: Juice WRLD]
Shorty like a thousand dollar plate, fine china
Tell her that she beautiful every day, I remind her
Then I jump in the pussy like a lake, I'm a diver
And her last man was a pussy, had a vagina
I get lost in her eyes, like dust from the skies
It's her body or nobody, I refuse to compromise
So if she leaves, I'ma kill her, oh, she'll die
Did I say that out loud? I'm so crazy about mine

[Verse 2: Future]
I'm so crazy about mine (Wheezy outta here)
I'm goin' to Pluto with my girl (Oh, shorty)
I'm goin' to Jupiter with my girl (Don't call your exes)
I'm goin' to Mars with my girl (Don't call your exes)
I'm goin' to Saturn with my girl
Been feelin' like I'm runnin' out of space
You need to send your location, I can't think
I done fell in love twice but I gotta be lyin'
'Cause I'm livin' ten lives, I go crazy about mines (Ayy)

[Chorus: Juice WRLD]
Shorty like a thousand dollar plate, fine china
Tell her that she beautiful every day, I remind her
Then I jump in the pussy like a lake, I'm a diver
And her last man was a pussy, had a vagina
I get lost in her eyes, like dust from the skies
It's her body or nobody, I refuse to compromise
So if she leaves, I'ma kill her, oh, she'll die
Did I say that out loud? I'm so crazy about mine

[Outro: Juice WRLD]
Did I say that out loud? I'm so crazy about mine
