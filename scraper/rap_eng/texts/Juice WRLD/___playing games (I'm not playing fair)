[Intro]
Enviyon on the mix
Baby where you at
We can play these games, if you wanna

[Chorus]
We can play these games, if you wanna
And you can say my name, if you wanna
We can take it there
You can be my main, if you wanna
Or you could give me brain, if you wanna
Baby where you at
Hey, my mama told me never play with karma
The only thing I'm lovin' is the drama
I'm not playing fair
Hey, I'm playin' love games cause I wanna
And even if I lose I'mma lace up and play again
Lace up and play again
And even if I lose I'mma lace up and play again
La-la-lace up and play again
And even if I lose I'mma lace up and play again

[Verse 1]
Before I get ya name, girl, I gotta warn ya
I'm so cold, moved to California
Just to even out, just to even out
Now that we got that out the way
Girl, what you about?
Time passes, chillin' wit' a few hoes
One is on my lap, it was 3 in my 2 door
They know me too well, showin' all my loopholes
Now I gotta move to some hoes from the west coast
All they wanna do is coke, give em' red nose
Now I got em' on the leash, I'm like let's go
All they wanna do is coke, give em' red nose
Now I got em' on the leash, I'm the dog 'doe
Crash! All this broken glass, I feel like a vandal
Smash! When I do the dash, I'mma crash the lambo
Love how it never lasts, love is like a scandal
Yeah, my love is like a scandal

[Chorus]
We can play these games, if you wanna
And you can say my name, if you wanna
We can take it there
You can be my main, if you wanna
Or you could give me brain, if you wanna
Baby where you at
Hey, my mama told me never play with karma
The only thing I'm lovin' is the drama
I'm not playing fair
Hey, I'm playin' love games cause I wanna
And even if I lose I'mma lace up and play again

[Verse 2]
Lace up, lace up, lace up
Better keep it bool, I'mma heartbreaker
She gon' give me head till' she drip make-up
Get up in her head, and see what she made of
Go cry to your man but he can't save ya'
Go and tell him that another nigga played ya'
I can see the tears all in your face
Knowing damn well, you can't run away
You can't run away
Knowing damn well you can't run away
I can see the tears in your face

[Chorus]
We can play these games, if you wanna
And you can say my name, if you wanna
We can take it there
You can be my main, if you wanna
Or you could give me brain, if you wanna
Baby where you at
Hey, my mama told me never play with karma
The only thing I'm lovin' is the drama
I'm not playing fair
Hey, I'm playin' love games cause I wanna
And even if I lose I'mma lace up and play again
Lace up and play again

[Outro]
And even if I lose I'mma lace up and play again
La-la-lace up and play again
And even if I lose I'mma lace up and play again
