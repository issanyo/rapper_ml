[Intro]
Murda On The Beat So It's Not Nice

[Chorus: Juice WRLD]
Go with your bitch, she gon' come
Pull a choppa out, they gon' run
I don't got no time for no dubs
In the strip club throwin' dubs
All the bad bitches show me love
Got a cabinet filled with drugs
I don't got no time for no dubs
I don't got no time for her love

[Verse 1: Juice WRLD]
I don't got no time
I'm gon' tote my 9
Transform to a chopper, call that bitch Optimus Prime
You gon' need a doctor, if you fuck with me and mine
You don't want no problems, bitch
My gun sing like the opera bitch
Money like I'm Oprah bitch
Thought I fuckin' told you, bitch
You'll get cranked like Soulja bitch
Fuck you, then it's over with
Everything but sober bitch
Union like a Soviet
Life's a gamble, I don't scramble
I risk all my poker chips
40 blow you out like candles, you don't want no smoke lil bitch
LOL, you a joke, lil bitch
I'm a rich nigga, you a broke lil bitch
Run up on me, you'll get poked lil bitch
Big guns, I'm gon tote lil bitch
My dick in her throat, lil bitch
Best believe she choke a bit
All of my niggas they ballin', they swishin', Calvin Cambridge
Pull up on him with my clip, it's extended
Fuck nigga ain't [?]

[Chorus: Juice WRLD]
Go with your bitch, she gon' come
Pull a choppa out, they gon' run
I don't got no time for no dubs
In the strip club throwin' dubs
All the bad bitches show me love
Got a cabinet filled with drugs
I don't got no time for no dubs
I don't got no time for her love

[Verse 2: D Savage]
I don't got no time for her love
Baby, I'm too fucked up off these drugs
In the club, throwin' dubs
Got the choppa and my niggas in the club
I'm so high, might blast off
Steal yo shit and skrt off
Gas pack, cookies what I'm smokin' on
I pour up a 4 for my niggas
I think I got mud in my liver
On the block rollin' a Backwood, cause we do not fuck with no Swishers

[Chorus: Juice WRLD]
Go with your bitch, she gon' come
Pull a choppa out, they gon' run
I don't got no time for no dubs
In the strip club throwin' dubs
All the bad bitches show me love
Got a cabinet filled with drugs
I don't got no time for no dubs
I don't got no time for her love
