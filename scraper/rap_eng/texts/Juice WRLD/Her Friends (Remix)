[Chorus - Juice Wlrd]
Yeah, I hate to say it but I fell in love again
We needed a vacation, so we took a trip to France
I just spent $2,000 on a shirt and a pair of pants
If you niggas couldn't tell, I'm never goin' broke again
I love poppin' Percocets, my baby love the Xans
Had to cuff her up, can't do that single shit again
I really love her style, but I really hate her friends
They'll be hating outside the club when they can't even get in

[Verse 1 - Juice Wrld]
Look at me now like Chris Brown
I'm a king, that's my queen, better bow down
All the hoes on my line 'cause I'm up now, yeah
Come through when she's not around, yeah
I'm just playing, bae, you know I'm here to stay
This is real love, I ain't here to play
I need real drugs, not the fake Perks, but the real ones
I remember I was caught up in my feelings
All these women starting to look like evil villains
Baby, you're a hero, you're so different
Had to put the drug talk down for a minute
Listen, this bitch got me tripping

[Chorus - Juice Wrld & Lonelynite]
Yeah, I hate to say it but I fell in love again
We needed a vacation, so we took a trip to France
I just spent $2,000 on a shirt and a pair of pants
If you niggas couldn't tell, I'm never going broke again
I love poppin' Percocets, my baby love the Xans
Had to cuff her up, can't do that single shit again
I really love her style, but I really hate her friends
They'll be hating outside the club when they can't even get in

[Verse 2 - Lonelynite]
Yea I hate to say it but I fell in love again
You need a vacation so you took a trip on cid'
I just spent $2,000 on some brand new Gucci pants
Diamonds round my neck it gon' put you in a trance
Told her that I love her but I really hate her friends
She look me in my eyes begging that I make amends
Yea I hate to say it but I fell in love again
You need a vacation so you took a trip on cid'
I just spent $2,000 on some brand new Gucci pants
Diamonds round my neck it gon' put you in a trance
Told her that I love her but I really hate her friends
She look me in my eyes begging that I make amends

[Chorus - Juice Wlrd]
Yeah, I hate to say it but I fell in love again
We needed a vacation, so we took a trip to France
I just spent $2,000 on a shirt and a pair of pants
If you niggas couldn't tell, I'm never goin' broke again
I love poppin' Percocets, my baby love the Xans
Had to cuff her up, can't do that single shit again
I really love her style, but I really hate her friends
They'll be hating outside the club when they can't even get in
