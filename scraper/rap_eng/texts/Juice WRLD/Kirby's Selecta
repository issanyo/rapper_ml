[Intro]
I take Hennessey to heal the pain
Styn
I take Hennessey to heal the pain
It'll heal the pain
I take Hennessey to heal the pain
Percocets to forget my name
Ahh, woah
Pour up, pour up
I take Hennessey to... pour up

[Hook]
I take Hennessey to heal the pain
Percocets to forget my name
They gon' put me out my shame
They gon' put me out my shame
I heard she do cocaine (white), we got cocaine
I heard she like good gas (gas), we got propane
I think that all girls the same
I think that all girls the same
Never been a superhero
No Batman baby, I feel like Bane
This music shit like heroin heroin, put it in your veins
They ask me how dare I dare I, say the shit I say

[Verse 1]
But know I feel the same take a [?] with me and show them
Like to move but I shine like the money dance
If I want you dead I even pay a hundred grand
But I don't got time for it, I just gotta dance for it
[?] I'm like damn we got the drugs for it
That bitch say she need some drugs but what she do for it
Bro say he wanna be gang but would he shoot for us
Wouldn't shoot for us, wouldn't shoot for us

[Hook]
I take Hennessey to heal the pain
Percocets to forget my name
They gon' put me out my shame
They gon' put me out my shame
I heard she do cocaine, we got cocaine
I heard she like good gas (aye), we got propane
I think that all girls the same
I think that all girls the same
Never been a superhero
No Batman baby, I feel like Bane
This music shit like heroin heroin, put it in your veins
They ask me how they ride they ride, say the shit I say

[Verse 2]
She addicted to my sound like a dope fiend
I got a confession, I love codeine
Ain't nothin' to brag about, ain't nothin' to brag about
But I could afford some Actavis so that's something to brag about
Enough about the lean, lets talk business
Choppa with a beam that's my vengeance
I'm a loner I need a 30
So there'll be no need to keep some henchmen
I got a stick, dummy
I let it hit, dummy
I got a grip on me
Baby I get [?]
Hundred round drum on me
Ridin' with me you a big dummy
Ain't takin' shit from me
All these shooters on me
They been talkin' tough to me but they ain't doin' nothin'
Imma risk it all, let 'em know its all or nothin'
I remember when the hoes wouldn't pick up the phone
Now every time I call they gon' come runnin'

[Hook]
I take Hennessey to heal the pain
Percocets to forget my name
They gon' put me out my shame
They gon' put me out my shame
I heard she do cocaine, we got cocaine
I heard she like good gas, we got propane
I think that all girls the same
I think that all girls the same
Never been a superhero
No Batman baby, I feel like Bane
This music shit like heroin heroin, put it in your veins
They ask me how they ride they ride, say the shit I say
