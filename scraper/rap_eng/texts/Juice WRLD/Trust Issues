[Hook]
Tell me that I got trust issues
You know I can't stand her
Codeine in my Fanta
Three hoes in my lap lil' bitch now what you want from Santa?

[Verse]
Say I got trust issues
She know I can't stand her
Dirty in my Fanta
Three hoes in my lap lil' bitch now what you want from Santa?
Jack 'em like O'Lantern
Gucci on the pattern
Outer space, on Saturn
Pop a Molly, XT it's the same damn thing
Bitch I'll go Bathing Ape you like a chimpanzee
Bought the whole crew Xans now the whole crew sleep
And my chopper got a kick I call that ho Bruce Lee, eyy
Feel like Freddy Kreuger I'm walkin' in a dream
Fanta be my best friend I'm walkin' with the lean
And my gun got pink eye, red beam
Ballin' like prime time, dream team

[Hook]
Tell me that I got trust issues
You know I can't stand her
Codeine in my Fanta
Three hoes in my lap lil' bitch now what you want from Santa?

[Outro]
Say I got trust issues
