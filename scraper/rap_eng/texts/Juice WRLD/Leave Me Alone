[Chorus]
Okay, okay, alright
I've been getting high all night
Went to LA and I took the wrong flight
Got high then I took the wrong ride
Balling but I feel like off sides
Smoking weed just to pass time
Can't live in the past time
Looking at the future on my own

[Verse 1]
I remember when I fell in love
Fell in love, and it blew up in my face, land mine
I remember doing hella xans, hella Percocets
Thinking I was finna pass time
I feel like I'm Tony Hawk, kick push, kick push
Yeah, I'm on my grind
They wanna see me on TV, yeah
Cause I be ballin' like it's Prime time
And my ex calls my phone
Every now and then she won't get a response
Cause it's money on my phone (Cash on my phone)
Ballin hard in the Saint Laurent

[Hook]
Leave me alone
You know I'm gone, yeah you know I'm gone
Why you still on my phone
You know what I'm on, I'm on a money hunt, yeah

[Bridge]
I just gotta keep the shit together
I just gotta keep the shit together
I just need, I just need the money that's forever
You know what I'm on I'm on a money hunt, yeah
I just gotta keep the shit together
I just gotta keep the shit together
I just want the money that's forever
That's forever, that's forever, that's forever
You know what I'm on, I'm on a money hunt

[Chorus]
Okay, okay, alright
I've been getting high all night
Went to LA and I took the wrong flight
Got high then I took the wrong ride
Balling but I feel like off sides
Smoking weed just to pass time
Can't live in the past time
Looking at the future on my own

[Verse 2]
Looking in the future, all mine
Searching for the shit you can't find
She gone let me fuck I'm inside
Ain't run from nothing, no high
I ain't feeling low I'm too high
Bad bitch and she came from Dubai
Only took me two tries
(One two, one two)


[Outro]
Let me talk my shit
Let me spark my blunt
Let me pour my fifth
You can't talk like this
You can't walk like this
Now they're on my dick
Rose gold
My watch look like piss
Everybody loves Juice
Everybody hates Chris
Water on my wrist
Probably fucking your bitch
Silly rabbit tricks are for kids
Aye
Talk my, talk my
Talk my shit
Let me talk my shit
Let me talk my talk
Hey
