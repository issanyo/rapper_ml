[Chorus]
I'm gon' ball on these hoes, Larry Bird
Talkin' shit, you get hit, you out of words
I ain't kickin' it, I kick you to the curb
I get drunk then I talk with a slur
Last night was a blur
Almost crashed, had to skrt
I ain't R Kelly, but bitch I'ma flirt
Then I get in her guts, Dr. Miami Surgeon
Ray J with it, I'll hit a bitch first

[Verse 1]
That bitch wanna fuck me, where?
In the front seat
Gun in my Givenchy, I gotta stay comfy
I know they gon' hate me, yeah
They gon' love me
2 Thousand on a sweater, bitch you know that you can't touch me
Her contact name is vacuum bitch, cause I know she gon' suck me
Don't know if I'm really handsome, cause the money hide the ugly
She say she wanna cuddle, nah
But I'll buy her a snuggie
I'm sorry, I'm not sorry
To this love shit I'm a zombie, yeah
Pill pop, drugs, I'm a junky
Spend my cash on Percocets, I may run out of money
Say you wanna beef, nigga lemme know sumn'
I don't throw hands, but that gun throw sumn'

[Chorus]
I'm gon' ball on these hoes, Larry Bird
Talkin' shit, you get hit, you out of words
I ain't kickin' it, I kick you to the curb
I get drunk then I talk with a slur
Last night was a blur
Amost crashed, had to skrt
I ain't R Kelly, but bitch I'ma flirt
Then I get in her guts, Dr. Miami Surgeon
Ray J with it, I'll hit a bitch first
