[Chorus]
I heard if you look her in her eyes, you might die
Bad bitch prolly make a grown man cry
Heartbreak bound to leave a nigga traumatized
She's my drug, I gotta personify
Don't say her name in a mirror 3 times
Learned the hard way, but that was the last time
Endin' my life, committed her last crime
Thought that was her last time

[Verse 1]
I told her that her secret safe with me
I told her that her love is all I need
Her soul, I'll keep, it helps me sleep
Helps me Rest In Peace
Don't know where to go, don't know where I've been
I've been to high off Klonopins
Lord knows I don't got any other friends
I befriended the drugs again
I fell in love with the plug again
I put it under the rug again
I'm drownin' in a cup full of mud again
Cross my heart and hope I don't give in

[Chorus]
I heard if you look her in her eyes, you might die
Bad bitch prolly make a grown man cry
Heartbreak bound to leave a nigga traumatized
She's my drug, I gotta personify
Don't say her name in a mirror 3 times
Learned the hard way, but that was the last time
Endin' my life, committed her last crime
Thought that was her last time

[Verse 2]
Ooh, ooh
What do I do, this shit's so suicidal
Percocets, in my vitals
Bible of the rifle, that's all that I know
Codeine got a nigga mind froze
Codeine got a nigga time slow
The devil in the red dress kills
They told me not to take the red pill
I took the red pill and the blue pill
Last night was to real


[Chorus]
I heard if you look her in her eyes, you might die
Bad bitch prolly make a grown man cry
Heartbreak bound to leave a nigga traumatized
She's my drug, I gotta personify
Don't say her name in a mirror 3 times
Learned the hard way, but that was the last time
Endin' my life, committed her last crime
Thought that was her last time
