[Chorus]
I'm in my black Benz, uh
Doin' cocaine with my black friends, uh
We'll be high as hell before the night ends, yeah
We'll be high before the night ends
Before the night ends
Switch up to the white Benz, uh (Benz)
Doin' codeine with my white friends, uh (friends)
Uh, we'll be high as hell before the night ends, yeah (night ends)
Before the night ends (woah)
Before the night begins

[Verse 1]
Lord have mercy
I know that these perkys finna hurt me, ayy
Sometimes I feel like they doin' surgery
Tell me, are they workin'? (Are they workin'?) Are they workin'?
Tell me, are they workin'?
I party too damn much
And you niggas can't keep up
I'm getting too fucked up, too fucked up
Yeah, I'm too fucked up
Won't look up til' the sun come up
Pills with the Hennessy, I might throw up
I might throw up, I'll be okay

[Chorus]
In my black Benz, uh
Doin' cocaine with my black friends, uh
We'll be high as hell before the night ends, yeah
We'll be high before the night ends
Before the night ends
Switch up to the white Benz, uh
Doin' codeine with my white friends, uh (friends)
Uh, we'll be high as hell before the night ends, yeah (night ends)
Before the night ends (woah)
Before the night begins (woah)

[Verse 2]
Every day's a party, don't let no one tell you different
No lames allowed, you should really keep your distance
Smokin' on loud, and that codeine I sip
Pourin' up this purple shit until it's in my piss
R.I.P. to Prince, we got purple rain on deck
She love Bobby Brown so we keep the 'caine on deck
There be haters 'round, keep a AK on deck
Man down, man down, on board
Party animals, I'm a lion in the zoo
Party animals, I'm a lion at the zoo
Party animals, I'm a party animal
I'm a party, yeah

[Chorus]
In my black Benz, uh
Doin' cocaine with my black friends, uh
We'll be high as hell before the night ends, yeah
We'll be high before the night ends
Before the night ends
Switch up to the white Benz, uh
Doin' codeine with my white friends, uh (friends)
Uh, we'll be high as hell before the night ends, yeah (night ends)
Before the night ends (woah)
Before the night begins (woah)

[Outro]
Before the night begins
Before the night begins
