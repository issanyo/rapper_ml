[Chorus: Lil Ox]
Uh-huh, yuh this one for the legend
I feel like a king
And these other niggas peasants
We should take a another niggas lose as a lesson
Hopefully I finna meet this niggas up in heaven
I feel like I’m lost in my mind sometimes
I feel like I’m dropped like a dime sometimes
I just tryna find out what’s mine sometimes
Just tryna find out what’s mine sometimes
I get lost in the sauce way to often
Got my soul back like I fucking sold it
(Uh-uh) this shit is cold this is scoldin
I think about my life when it’s over
Sometimes I think it’s running up
I think it’s comin up
Yes imma keep my .40 tucked
I cannot go out
I cannot go out
I will not go out
Gotta show out
Ball too hard these niggas blow out
Yeah, it’s a blow out
Suicide if you tryna take my drugs (x3)
Homicide, baby will you hold my gun
Suicide if you tryna take my drugs
Live a lie, look at all the shit you’ve done, uh
Suicide if you tryna take my drugs
Homicide, here’s my gun
Specify, all the lies you’ve told me
Look at me, what am I on?
Perky, molly, xanny, all that shit finna do me shit
I’m so high that I cannot remember to forget
Matter a fact let’s just take a sec
REST IN PEACE X X X YEAH YEAH YEAH
Rest In Peace the niggas that left
Pray for all dem niggas the best
I feel like I’m up in my prime
But who am I gon share my prime wit
Who am I gon share my time wit
Sometimes its just perfect timing
Singing like I’m X X X TENTACIÓN
Damn, this shit is some wyhnin
Yeah, suicide if you tryna take my girl
Homicide, you tryna fuck me up
Homicide, if you tryna take my girl
Imma hit a hit like I smack that tung
