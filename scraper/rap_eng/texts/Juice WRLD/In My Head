[Verse 1: Juice WRLD]
Sometimes life brings me to my knees
Drowns me in my misery
Cuts me deep, makes me bleed
I'm ten feet at the cemetery
Maybe it's all in my head, yeah
Maybe I just need rest, yeah
Lately I've been stressed, tryna impress
The whole world
I'm lost in a cold world

[Chorus: Andrew Taggart]
'Cause every night
I convince myself it's all in my head
Maybe none of this is real life
Or maybe I'm just not feeling it yet
So every time
I hear the voices scream inside of my head
I let 'em know if this is real life
We're on our own, so we better be friends

[Drop: Juice WRLD]
Oh, ah, ah
Oh, ah, ah

[Verse 2: Juice WRLD]
Will I see better days? I don't know
Bet you've never seen a frown like this before
I was told to always look at things a little different
See my demons through kaleidoscopes
Here goes some advice I found
Say it with me, scream it loud
Don't let nothing bring you down
And out, and out

[Chorus: Andrew Taggart]
'Cause every night
I convince myself it's all in my head
Maybe none of this is real life
Or maybe I'm just not feeling it yet
So every time
I hear the voices scream inside of my head
I let 'em know if this is real life
We're on our own, so we better be friends

[Drop: Juice WRLD]
Oh, ah, ah
Oh, ah, ah
Oh, ah, ah
Oh, ah, ah

[Chorus: Andrew Taggart]
‘Cause every night
I convince myself it’s all in my head
Maybe none of this is real life
Or maybe I’m just not feeling it yet
So every time
I hear the voices scream inside of my head
I let ‘em know if this is real life
We’re on our own, so we better be friends

[Drop: Juice WRLD]
Oh, ah, ah
Oh, ah, ah
Oh, ah, ah
Oh, ah, ah
