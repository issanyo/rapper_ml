[Chorus]
Let my insecurities take over
Right now it's kinda hard to stay sober
Last thing I wanna hear is "it's over"
Love is deadly it's gon' put me in a coma
If I lose you, then I'm losing my composure
Got me flipping in my coffin, turnin' over
All this pain in my chest got my lungs hurt
She gon' stab me on my left side, heart burst

[Verse]
I'm so scared, I'm so so scared
That I cared, and you don't care
Momma always told me not to have any fears
But this shit is deadly like electric chairs
You told me you leavin', death to my ears
This shit ain't Houdini baby, don't disappear
Heart break and harmony, feel it in the air
Tell Cupid stick to his day job yeah
I passed out in the party, almost died right there
All the drug use starting to pay off, yeah
I don't work a job, but I lay off, yeah
The devil on my shoulder need to stay off, yeah

[Chorus]
Let my insecurities take over
Right now it's kinda hard to stay sober
Last thing I wanna hear is it's over
Love is deadly it's gon' put me in a coma
If I lose you, then I'm losing my composure
Got me flipping in my coffin, turnin' over
All this pain in my chest got my lungs hurt
She gon' stab me in my left side, heart burst
