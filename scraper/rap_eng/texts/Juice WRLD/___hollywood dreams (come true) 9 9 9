[Intro]
Yo
You've been a wonderful audience
And for our last song
We'll be performing Hollywood Dreams
1-2-3-4
Enviyon on the mix
I'mma go to Cali, I will never come back
I ain't never comin' back

[Chorus 1]
I race in a Wraith, ooh
Bad bitch only coming over for a taste, for a taste, ooh
Wake up in the morning taking drugs to the face, yeah
Cuttin' to the chase, yeah
And keepin' it true, yeah
I've been runnin' from you, yeah

[Verse 1]
I just wanna feel like the next big thing
I just wanna feel like the next big thing
I'm looking at the TV-screen
Like one day, that'll be me

[Chorus 2]
Hollywood dreams, Hollywood dreams
My Hollywood dreams, Hollywood dreams
Come true to me, come true to me
Hollywood dreams, Hollywood dreams
My Hollywood dreams, Hollywood dreams
Come true to me, so new to me

[Verse 2]
When you broke my heart, I couldn't reverse it
I knew from the start, that it wasn't worth it
It felt too perfect
I gotta run away now
Catch me in a valley in the middle of a lane now
I just want somebody who will hold me down and stay down, yeah
That's my Hollywood dream, Hollywood dream
Come true to me, come true to me

[Chorus 1]
I race in a Wraith, ooh
Bad bitch only coming over for a taste, for a taste, ooh
Wake up in the morning taking drugs to the face, yeah
Cuttin' to the chase, yeah
And keepin' it true, yeah
I've been runnin' from you, yeah

[Chorus 2]
My Hollywood dreams, Hollywood dreams
Hollywood dreams, Hollywood dreams
Come true to me, come true to me
My Hollywood dreams, Hollywood dreams
Hollywood dreams, Hollywood dreams
Come true, my dreams come true to me
Hollywood dreams, Hollywood dreams
Hollywood dreams, Hollywood dreams
Come true to me, come true to me
Hollywood dreams, Hollywood dreams
Hollywood dreams, Hollywood dreams
Come true, my dreams come true

[Chorus 1]
I race in a Wraith, uhh
Bad bitch only coming over for a taste, for a taste, uhh
Wake up in the morning taking drugs to the face, yuh
Cuttin' to the chase, yuh
And keepin' it true, yuh
I've been runnin' from you, yuh

[Outro]
Once I go to Cali, I ain't never coming back
I ain't never coming back
I ain't never coming back
