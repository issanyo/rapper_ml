[Intro]
Menoh
Yuh, yuh, yuh
Yuh, yuh, yuh
Yuh, yuh

[Chorus: KILL.ZERO]
Never scarred, pop-punkstar
Don't have a heart, dead from the start
I'm a dark pop-punkstar
Been torn apart, been torn apart

[Verse: Juice WRLD]
She's a rebel, yeah, wait
She's a rebel, yeah, hey
She's a rebel, I'm the devil
Heart empty, but I got a head full
No brains 'cause the pills got 'em scrambled
Listening to Megadeth, watchin' Death Note
Michael Phelps, hit her with the backstroke
Collar round my neck bark but I won't choke
No I won't go, on my way home
Rolling up dope, to the same songs
Codeine, fuego, lean a day old, yeah I love the taste
Sip it 'till I go to sleep and drink it when I wake
Unload that choppa on 'em, earthquake
Do a drive by while blasting Green Day, hey

[Chorus: KILL.ZERO]
Never scarred, pop-punkstar
Don't have a heart, dead from the start
I'm a dark pop-punkstar
Been torn apart, been torn apart
