[Intro: 0 and Juice WRLD]
Yuh!
Uh

[Chorus: Juice WRLD]
I told her that I don't care, ooh
I know you standing over there
With that other guy
But I don't care, huh
'Cause I got a bitch right here, aye
Red hean like a reindeer, ooh
Rolled off with the new Glock, ooh
Had rocks in the tube socks, oh
Bad kids like the BoonDocks, oh

[Verse: KILL.ZERO]
I finesse don't need a Glock
She can't sip my wok
I don't needa tote no stick
One call and you get chopped
Asking to get popped
Lackin' in the lot
All this dirty money got me feelin' like I stank
Sprintin' to the bank
Stare and you'll get shanked
Bitches wanna fuck I got no time to pipe a skank
I just want the head
Can they give me that instead?
I made shorty mad
I started hitting all her friends

[Chorus: Juice WRLD]
I told her that I don't care, ooh
I know you standing over there
With that other guy
But I don't care, huh
'Cause I got a bitch right here, aye
Red hean like a reindeer, ooh
Rolled off with the new Glock, ooh
Had rocks in the tube socks, oh
Bad kids like the BoonDocks, oh
