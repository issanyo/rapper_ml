[Intro]
K. Swisha
Uh, uh, life's not fair, but I'm here so don't fear
You're not the boss of me now, you're not the boss of me now
You're not so big, yeah

[Chorus]
Life's not fair, but I'm here so don't fear
Even though your heart may tear, don't be scared
Don't be scared, cause I'm here
Life's not fair, but I'm here so don't fear
Even though your heart may tear
Don't be scared, don't be scared, don't be scared

[Verse 1]
Can't nobody tell you how to love
Can't nobody tell you how to live life
Can't nobody tear me from the drugs
Can't nobody tell me what it feels like
I'm not the one to give advice
Social suicide, see you on the other side
If I speak my mind, they gon' have me crucified
Gonna crucify, baby, I'm ready to die
But even if I'm gone, I'm still here, so don't fear
My lost years are hidden in her tears, inspired by her fears

[Chorus] x2
Life's not fair, but I'm here so don't fear
Even though your heart may tear, don't be scared
Don't be scared, cause I'm here
Life's not fair, but I'm here so don't fear
Even though your heart may tear
Don't be scared, don't be scared, don't be scared

[Verse 2]
I don't fear no one, paranoid, going in my gut (ayy)
To be honest, I feel like the one
I feel like the one, like the chosen one
You the silver one, I'm the golden one
This my own style, yeah, I be stealin' up
I love smoking gas, she be feelin' me up
When I fall on the ground, drugs be picking me up
Molly, holy ghost, gimme a holy ghost
I fuck another hoe, I fuck a couple of hoes
Cocaine overdose, she had a bunch of those
She had a bunch of those, she had a runny nose, woah
Play rough, ain't try to throw no balls
Ain't try to make no friends, ain't try to make no foes
No need new friends like Drake
Say you want beef, got steak, she say I'm not her type
Wasn't trying to fuck no way, hey
