[Chorus]
I'd do anything in my power, to see, you just smile
I want you to prosper, and come proper
Even if that means I ain't by your side
I'd do anything in my power, to see, you just smile
I want you to prosper, and come proper
Even if that means I ain't by your side

[Verse 1]
Devil on my shoulder telling me I'll die soon
I don't really want that to impact you
But I don't know, maybe I'm just paranoid
I just want the best for you, I just want what's left of you
Oh, will you tell me that you're sad inside
I'm sad that I can't satisfy
Yeah I pray that I'll get it right this time
Maybe we'll be alright
Oh, will you tell me that you're sad inside
I'm sad that I can't satisfy
Yeah, I pray that I'll get it right this time
Maybe we'll be alright

[Chorus]
I'd do anything in my power, to see, you just smile
I want you to prosper, and come proper
Even if that means I ain't by your side
I'd do anything in my power, to see, you just smile
I want you to prosper, and come proper
Even if that means I ain't by your side

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
I'd do anything in my power, to see, you just smile
I want you to prosper, and come proper
Even if that means I ain't by your side
I'd do anything in my power, to see, you just smile
I want you to prosper, and come proper
Even if that means I ain't by your side
