This one for the legend I feel like a king with these other niggas present we should take another night lost as a lesson hopefully imma meet these niggas up in heaven I feel like I'm lost in my mind sometimes I feel like I'm drop like I'm dying sometimes I'm just Tryna find when that was my sometimes I'm just tryna find when that was my sometimes ay I get lost in the sauce way to often buy my soul back like I fucking sold it this shit gold this shit golden I wonder what will happen when my life is over ay some times I think it's coming up I think they running up yes so imma keep my 40 tup I can not go out I can not go out I will not go out I gotta show out I ball on these niggas to hard I can not blow out Ye it's the blow out
(chorus)
Suicide if you try to take my drugs
Suicide if you try to take my drugs
Suicide if you try to take my drugs
Homicide baby would you hold my gun
Suicide if you try to take my drugs
Live a lie look at all the shit you done
Suicide if you try to take my drugs
Homicide gonna hold my gun
Specify all the shit you've done
Look at me what have owned
(verse 2)
Perky molly zeni all that shit in one mix
I'm so high I can't remember to forget
Matter fact let's just take a sec
Rest in peace to the niggas that left
Rest in peace to the niggas that left
And praise all the niggas that's left
I feel like I'm up in my prime
But who am I gonna share my prime with
Who am I gonna share my time with
Sometime it's just perfect timing
Singing like I'm cc winis
Dam this shit so whinny
(Chorus)
Suicide if you try to take my drugs
Homicide if you try to rob my pub
Homicide if you try to take my gun
Ima hit a lit like I smack that tounge
Suicide if you try to take my drugs
Homicide if you try to rob my pub
Homicide if I'm reaching for my gun
I'm not the one I'm not the one ay
