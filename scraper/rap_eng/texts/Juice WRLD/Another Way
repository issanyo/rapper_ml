[Chorus]
I smoke another to the face
Whenever I don't feel okay
It's gotta be another way
For me to get rid of my shade
Take narcotics to the face
Fuckin' up my brain
My emotions in a cage
They keep me contain
They keep me contained
She want me out her way
Shorty throw away the key
Love is not a game, I am not ashamed

[Verse 1]
Bitch I'm fucked up, tryna clean the mess up
Yeah I fucked up, yeah I had to fess up
I'm a robot for her, love Alexa
When they say her name wrong it's Alexuhh
This is not an ordinary women
I feel like I love her to the fullest
Cupid ain't been shooting at me with no ordinary bullets
That's my biggest problem, I feel overhooked
Shit I was always scared of gettin' overlooked
Consequences in my side, I wish I never looked
Breaking up, never us
Fuck the time, it's forever us

[Chorus]
Whenever I don't feel okay
It's gotta be another way
For me to get rid of my shade
Take narcotics to the face
Fuckin' up my brain
My emotions in a cage
They keep me contain
They keep me contained
She want me out her way
Shorty throw away the key
Love is not a game, I am not ashamed

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
Whenever I don't feel okay
It's gotta be another way
For me to get rid of my shade
Take narcotics to the face
Fuckin' up my brain
My emotions in a cage
They keep me contain
They keep me contained
She want me out her way
Shorty throw away the key
Love is not a game, I am not ashamed

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
I smoke another to the face
Whenever I don't feel okay
It's gotta be another way
For me to get rid of my shade
Take narcotics to the face
Fuckin' up my brain
My emotions in a cage
They keep me contain
They keep me contained
She want me out her way
Shorty throw away the key
Love is not a game, I am not ashamed
