(Intro)
I don't want to go there, with her
That lil bitch a no good woman
I'm calling it quits, I guess I'm a quitter
That lil bitch a no good woman
I don't want to go there, with her
That lil bitch a no good woman
I'm calling it quits, I guess I'm a quitter

(Verse)
I guess I'm a quitter, had to lose you so I could become a winner
Never been god so no I'm not a forgiver
I'm a grown lil man, could fuck on a baby sitter
Life's not fair like Malcolm in the Middle
Oh these bitches really tweakin, skeet and I delete em'
I drink lean by the liter, codeine fever
I got stripes like a tiger but I'm still a cheetah
She don't fuck with me, I don't fuck with me either
