[Intro]
Cash Money AP
Cash AP got the beat tight

[Chorus]
They told me that I got a way with words
But couldn't get away with my heart
She told me she gon' kick me to the curb
But I've been on the curb from the start
I've been takin' drugs to the face, yeah
If I run out, call the plug for replacements
In the basement, takin' pills til' I'm shakin'
Fixations, rich drugs I'm laced in

[Verse]
I'm just smokin' on chronic
Poppin' these pills, rockin' my designer
My insides hurt, but my outside's flawless
Fresh to death, like I'm out a coffin
Bitch it's Déjà Vu, I done seen it before
I, wonder if you don't love me no more
Too many pills, now I'm down on the floor
I woke up wanting some more
I woke up crying for more

[Chorus]
They told me that I got a way with words
But couldn't get away with my heart
She told me she gon' kick me to the curb
But I've been on the curb from the start
I've been takin' drugs to the face, yeah
If I run out, call the plug for replacements
In the basement, takin' pills til' I'm shakin'
Fixations, rich drugs I'm laced in

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
They told me that I got a way with words
But couldn't get away with my heart
She told me she gon' kick me to the curb
But I've been on the curb from the start
I've been takin' drugs to the face, yeah
If I run out, call the plug for replacements
In the basement, takin' pills til' I'm shakin'
Fixations, rich drugs I'm laced in
