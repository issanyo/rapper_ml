[Intro]
Woah, woah
I don't know what planet I'm on
All we do is roll up that strong, boy I swear
Boy I swear, I take a couple hits then I'm gone

[Chorus]
Boy I swear, boy I swear
I'm the man, I'm the man
Boy I swear, boy I swear

[Verse 1]
Boy I swear, I'm better than ever and I'ma be better forever
Boy I swear, she fuckin' whoever whenever, I fuck her whenever
Boy I swear, just keep it together, the money I get it forever
Boy I swear, forever forever, fucking forever forever
Boy I swear, I'm laced up, caked up with this ecstasy
I treat these drugs like my women, I keep 'em next to me, ay
I got more green than that spinach, I need my veggies
Breathing heavy but steady, this x it keep me from stressin'
I'm gone, ay ay
I don't know what planet I'm on
All we do is roll up that strong
Take a couple hits then I'm gone, and we gone

[Verse 2]
Girl I swear, you wasn't there when a nigga needed you (no no no)
I was doing everything I could to please you
Now I'm finna leave you, your ass is see through
I ain't Stevie, but I swear that I can't see you
Ay, and I'ma tell you what I do
I'm the man, I'm the man, with or without you
I don't need you at all, abide by my rules
I'ma smash every day, I'mma lose my cool
Boy I swear, boy I swear, get this mansion for my mama
Boy I swear, get a condo, a beach house in the Bahamas
Boy I swear, smokin' weed and talkin' business with Obama
Boy I swear, I'mma do it all and I don't want the drama

Boy I swear, boy I swear

I'm the man, I'm the man

[Verse 3]
You know I swear, you know these niggas talking
But me, I am not caring
I never walk the streets, I just run 'em, ain't talkin' errands
I'm the man, I'm the man

Boy I swear, boy I swear
Boy I swear, I'm that man
I'm that man, I'm that man, I'm that man

All we do is roll up the strong
