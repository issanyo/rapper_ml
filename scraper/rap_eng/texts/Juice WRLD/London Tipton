[Chorus: Juice WRLD]
I've been runnin' off on plugs, I need to rob another one
I've been rubbin' off on all these niggas, cause they steal the sauce
Fuck niggas and hatin' hoes, bitch I hate those
That lil bitch goes "hiss, hiss", she a snake hoe
Somethin' like a bad kid, I don't listen
Baby these not advils, these perscriptions
I just dropped a xan bar, in my Lipton
I'm livin' the suite life, London Tipton

[Verse: Juice WRLD]
Damn hoe, damn hoe
You ain't no fair
Fast life, fast life, no slow here
Got a Columbian plug, she a coke head
Told her come and ride dick like Moped
Take off, then she take her shirt off
Start the car, then skrt off
Then she take her skirt off
I love poppin' pills, mix it with the Smirnoff
Told me when I get too high and throw up, that's a turn off
Light my demons on fire and pray to god they burn off
I ain't Birdman baby, but I'm still Stunna
Drip or Drown with the sauce, like my name Gunna
I like percocets way more than Marijuanna

[Chorus: Juice WRLD]
I've been runnin' off on plugs, I need to rob another one
I've been rubbin' off on all these niggas, cause they steal the sauce
Fuck niggas and hatin' hoes, bitch I hate those
That lil bitch goes "hiss, hiss", she a snake hoe
Somethin' like a bad kid, I don't listen
Baby these not advils, these perscriptions
I just dropped a xan bar, in my Lipton
I'm livin' the suite life, London Tipton

[Verse: Doobie Dalil]
Get it how you live then, fuck my enemies
I just put a pyramid, in my Hennessey
I'm in the streets, and if she got an ass I'm prolly in her cheeks
She like "I gave Doobie some pussy, he don't remember me" I never do
Slidin' in my DM, who the hell is you
Vibin in this bitch, I'm smokin stank and eatin' edibles
Fuck it if it do not benefit, or bring us revenue
50 on my glizzy, one up top how I prepare to shoot
Gang bitch, run off on the plug, it's the gang shit
It's like I don't even wipe my ass, how I stain shit
Fuck her rough, choke her while I slam it like I'm Kane, bitch
And I swear I don't [?] my dick inside the same bitch

[Chorus: Juice WRLD]
I've been runnin' off on plugs, I need to rob another one
I've been rubbin' off on all these niggas, cause they steal the sauce
Fuck niggas and hatin' hoes, bitch I hate those
That lil bitch goes "hiss, hiss", she a snake hoe
Somethin' like a bad kid, I don't listen
Baby these not advils, these perscriptions
I just dropped a xan bar, in my Lipton
I'm livin' the suite life, London Tipton
