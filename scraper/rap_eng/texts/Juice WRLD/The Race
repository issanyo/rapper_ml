[Intro]
Murda on the beat so it's not nice

[Chorus]
Tell me she don't love me, she don't feel me
Drownin' in my sorrows baby, 10 feet
I remember I was wearing 10 deep
Now I'm wearing Gucci to my track meets
I'll be damned if these fuck niggas catch me
I'll be damned if these fuck niggas pass me
But I catch a fuck nigga like a taxi
Leave a pussy nigga leakin', need a maxi

[Verse 1]
I'm so busy rolling off the molly
This is why I don't fuck with parties
My brother had to send up a party
Niggas in the A was tryna act gnarly
I'm a smoker, feel like Bob Marley
Run a train on your bitch, that's a trolly
Tony Hawk on my grind, no ollie
Self-destruct off the drugs, kamikaze
I don't think that anyone can stop me
You ain't police bitch, why you tryna cop me
I don't think that anyone can stop me
I'm not a beat bitch, you know you can't drop me

[Chorus]
Tell me she don't love me, she don't feel me
Drownin' in my sorrows baby, 10 feet
I remember I was wearing 10 deep
Now I'm wearing Gucci to my track meets
I'll be damned if these fuck niggas catch me
I'll be damned if these fuck niggas pass me
But I catch a fuck nigga like a taxi
Leave a pussy nigga leakin', need a maxi

[Verse 2]
I took too many drugs, 'bout to OD
I robbed too many plugs out the OG
I remember when we came up on 5 piece
I remember when we ran from the police
These niggas really thinking that they know me
Nigga you don't know me cause of IG
I can prolly fuck your bitch on the high key
I'ma keep her in check nigga, Nike
I done fell in love with the perkies
I'm on go, I'm on go, nigga flying
Run up on me, I'm strapped nigga dying
Traumatized, leave a fuck nigga crying

[Chorus]
Tell me she don't love me, she don't feel me
Drownin' in my sorrows baby, 10 feet
I remember I was wearing 10 deep
Now I'm wearing Gucci to my track meets
I'll be damned if these fuck niggas catch me
I'll be damned if these fuck niggas pass me
But I catch a fuck nigga like a taxi
Leave a pussy nigga leakin', need a maxi
