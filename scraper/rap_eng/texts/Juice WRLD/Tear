[Chorus]
Put your hand on my chest
Tell me that its okay
I'll handle the rest
We'll be happy some day
Put your hand on my chest
Tell me that its okay
I'll handle the rest

[Verse]
Tears
I hate it when you drop tears
You're telling me {?}
I don't wanna say that I don't care {?}
But who am I to talk?
All my good songs got my Ex involved
I'm throwing shade with a lil pinch of salt
Yeah I know your right, I'm wrong
Everything's all my fault, right?
Our relationship is on the sideline
Ain't gonna be an earthquake this time
We'll be fine

[Chorus]
Put your hand on my chest
Tell me that its okay
I'll handle the rest
We'll be happy some day
Put your hand on my chest
Tell me that its okay
I'll handle the rest
