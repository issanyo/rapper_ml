[Lyrics From Snippet]
Sometimes, sometimes, sometime
Sometimes, sometimes, sometimes
Sometimes, sometimes, sometimes (hoo)
I wanna be by my lonely
I pop these perks by my lonely
I put in work by my lonely
40 on me, you know he my homie
I wanna be by my lonely
I take these perks by my lonely
I put in work by my lonely
40 on me, you know that's my homie
My mind, sometimes gets dark and wild
My mind, sometimes
Uh, I don’t wan' be bothered-

-hell
Breathin' just got a little harder
I mean well, I mean well
All is well, it ends well
Inhail, exhail
Losing my sanity, prolly
I’ll see you in hell
Yeah, I'ma meet you there
Isn't letting my demons, they bother me
When I'm sleeping, they sittin' on top of me
And wherever I go, they are following
I fell into the pit and it's bottomless
They want my soul but it isn't my property
Try and take it from me, demonic robbery
Crazy the way that the devil a lie to me
Just leave me alone, I could do bad on my own
I get high off my ass on my own
Girl, [?] I know you're strong
But if she don’t love me no more
I’m open more
Sometimes, sometimes, sometime
Sometimes, sometimes, sometimes
Sometimes, sometimes, sometimes
I wanna be by my lonely
I pop these perks by my lonely
I put in work by my lonely
40 on me, you know he's my homie
I wanna be by my lonely
I take these perks by my lonely
I put in work by my lonely
40 on me, you know that’s my homie
Oh, oh, There ain't no place like home
I wanna go back home
I hate the world we know, oh, oh, oh
There ain't no place like home
I wanna go back home
I hate the world we know
I'm fumbling, fumbling, fumbling, fumbling
Eye wondering, wondering, wondering
