Lyrics From Snippet

[Intro]
[?]
Purp, what's good, man?

[Chorus]
She know me well, well, well, she know me well
Told me she loved me still, bitch, go to hell
All the drugs I did, it was worth it, super worth it
Tell me why you had me feeling worthless
Now your heart broken, you need a surgeon, yeah
I know one thing for sure, one thing for certain, yeah
I know one thing's for sure, one thing's for certain, yeah, yeah, yeah
We ain't gon' do this, not again
Gucci cardigan, I'm the flyest gent
I found out what the problem is, breaking promises
It was the both of us

[Verse]
Oh
