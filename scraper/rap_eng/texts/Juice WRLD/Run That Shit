[Chorus]
Run that shit, ooh
Run that shit, ooh
I get paid today, I could fuck yo bitch
Glock with a razer blade, I never miss
Off White, just to match the Louboutins
Run that shit, yeah
Run that shit
Whole crew fresh as fuck, we run yo bitch
Load the clip, air it out
Reload again, run that shit
Fuck nigga run that shit

[Verse 1]
I just want the brain, psychiatrist, right
I don't see another nigga fly as this, right
I'm the type to bring a knife to a fist fight, so imagine what I'll bring to a knife fight
Shine bright, VVS, just like a night light
Make the night bright, I'm still rockin' Off White
All my purple dark, don't stick to the sides
Never feelin' low, I'm already high

[Chorus]
Run that shit, ooh
Run that shit, ooh
I get paid today, I could fuck yo bitch
Glock with a razer blade, I never miss
Off White, just to match the Louboutins
Run that shit, yeah
Run that shit
Whole crew fresh as fuck, we run yo bitch
Load the clip, air it out
Reload again, run that shit
Fuck nigga run that shit

[Verse: 2]
I admit, I'm the shit
I remember when they said I wasn't shit
Doubtin' it, now I'm clouded and it gon' surround the kid
But fuck that shit, fuck that shit, ooh
Rolly on who, that shit cost a brick
I do what I want to, you do what you need to
Choppa got a kick, I taught that bitch Kung-Fu
I just got a whip, it came with a sun roof
You was talkin' shit, come see what my gun do
You don't know me, baby I don't know you
I'm a real one, I don't gotta show you

[Chorus]
Run that shit, ooh
Run that shit, ooh
I get paid today, I could fuck yo bitch
Glock with a razer blade, I never miss
Off White, just to match the Louboutins
Run that shit, yeah
Run that shit
Whole crew fresh as fuck, we run yo bitch
Load the clip, air it out
Reload again, run that shit
Fuck nigga run that shit
