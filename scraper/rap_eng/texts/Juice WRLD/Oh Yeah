[Chorus: Juice WRLD]
Okay, let's skate
Bad bitch finna come my way
Going 90 when I'm on the highway
Can't go high without the high, ayy
Everyday I wake up, smoke another gram, ayy
I don't give a fuck or another damn, ayy
I'm smoking the kush from the Hoover Dam, ayy
I'ma let these bitches know who I am

[Verse 1: Lil Pump]
Fucked your bitch, told her, "bye-bye-bye" (yeah, ouu)
Smashed your main hoe, nut in her eye-eye-eye (brrt, Lil Pump)
Got a lot of racks on me (ouu, yeah)
Got a lot of gas on me (brrt, yeah)
Couple M's in jewelry (ouu, yeah)
And my wrist like jetski (ouu, yeah)
And I can't buy you no flight, no (ouu)
Look at my bustdown shine (yeah)
Pop some more molly (ouu), drink some more lean
Damn I just missed my flight (ouu, goddamn)
Pick a hundred bands up for the next show (brrt)
I don't wanna fuck, bitch, I just want throat (no)
I didn't wanna tell you that your mama was a hoe (yeah)
Million dollars cash just layin' in the floor (Lil Pump)
All this ice on me drippin' (ouu, drip)
Kick a bitch out, she trippin' (yeah, ouu)
I'm too rich to listen (ouu, brrt)
And my pinky ring still glisten (yeah)
Told her don't lie-lie (ouu)
No, you can't spend the night (ouu, yeah)
Bitch do not ask me why (no, yeah)
Cut the check or bye (yeah)

[Chorus: Juice WRLD]
Okay, let's skate
Bad bitch finna come my way

Can't go high without the high, ayy
Everyday I wake up, smoke another gram, ayy
I don't give a fuck or another damn, ayy
I'm smoking the kush from the Hoover Dam, ayy
I'ma let these bitches know who I am
