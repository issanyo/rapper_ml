[Intro]
Drugs, oh
They need lighters up for this one, heh
Drugs got me sweatin', but the room gettin' colder
Lookin' at the devil and the angel on my shoulder
Will I die tonight? I don't know, is it over?
Lookin' at my next high, I'm lookin' for closure

[Chorus]
Lean with me, pop with me
Get high with me if you rock with me
Smoke with me, drink with me
Fucked up liver with some bad kidneys
Lean with me, pop with me
Get high with me if you rock with me
Smoke with me, drink with me
Fucked up liver with some bad kidneys

[Verse 1]
Told her if I die I'ma die young
Every day I've been gettin' fucked up
Finally know the difference between love and drugs
Shorty tell me I should really sober up
This shit ain't fiction, it's too real
Fuck one dose, I need two pills
I'm lookin' for trouble so I know I'm gonna find it
Ring, ring, plug hit my phone, perfect timin'
I know I'm not right
But I'm not wrong, no, I'm not wrong
Girl, you hate it when I'm too high
But that's where I belong, where I belong (where I belong)

[Chorus]
Lean with me, pop with me
Get high with me if you rock with me
Smoke with me, drink with me
Fucked up liver with some bad kidneys, yeah
Lean with me, pop with me
Get high with me if you rock with me
Smoke with me, drink with me
Fucked up liver with some bad kidneys

[Verse 2]
Eyes red, no Visine
Crashed the Mustang, no Saleen
I love beans, I love lean
I laugh when they ask if my piss clean
Smoke with me, pop with me-e-e
Gucci store, come and shop with me-e-e
Overdose, would you drop for me-e-e?
I don't even wanna think about that right now
Let's get high, reach a new high
Take the pills and the shrooms at the same time
Went to Hollywood hills from the street life
Took too many drugs, I don't feel alright

[Chorus]
Get high with me if you rock with me
Smoke with me
Fucked up liver with some bad kidneys
Lean with me, pop with me
Get high with me if you rock with me
Smoke with me, drink with me
Fucked up liver with some bad kidneys

[Outro]
Oh, oh
Oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
