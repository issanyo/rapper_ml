[Pre-Hook: Juice WRLD]

It’s called Codeine Reasons
(Mumbles)
Aye I'm a player
Got a brand new gun, it got a Major Lazer
I took her to my lair
In the Himalayas

[Chorus: Juice WRLD]

I took her to my lair, in the Himalayas
Her boyfriend hatin' on me, got a Glock with a lazer
Ain't worried 'bout a god damn thing
I'm all about the paper
I'ma do my god damn thing, fuck all of them haters
Your momma found out you was suckin'
She like jesus save her, mmm
I may fuck that bitch, but I won't never save her, mmm
Pussy so good, damn I had to save it, mmm
Just so my lil thot can eat her out later, mmm

[Verse 1: Juice WRLD]

Can't organize my thots, don't need no note paper
Off the dome shit, smoke creative, anyways
You late to the party, have you belated
And if you want smoke, leave you cremated anyday
Put the bullet holes, in his windshield
Even if I'm havin' a bad day, I win still
Wake up, pray to god
Even thought that I sin still
Devil weighin' on my shoulders, like an anvil
Perky got a nigga itchin' uhh, ant hill
Fuck that bitch, then put her on my ad libs
You happy fake, bitch I'm mad real
Make that choppa masturbate, like a porn film



[Chorus]

I took her to my lair, in the Himalayas
Her boyfriend hatin' on me, got a Glock with a lazer
Ain't worried 'bout a god damn thing
I'm all about the paper
I'ma do my god damn thing, fuck all of them haters
Your momma found out you was suckin'
She like jesus save her, mmm
I may fuck that bitch, but I won't never save her, mmm
Pussy so good, damn I had to save it, mmm
Just so my lil thot can eat her out later, mmm


[Verse 2: Based]

Yea Just so my lil thot could eat her out later
Yea Going up the billboard like a elevator
She ain’t tryna fuck witchu she use a vibrator
Yea She vibin at my crib I kick her out later
Yea niggas really squares
I can’t play with em foreeal
I got shawties on a drill yea yea
I know niggas poppin pills
And they throwing up forreal
Codeine livers on the field yea ye
Visit molly at the follies yea
Capa Based, college parties
Calabasas flying like im jeff hardy
Im with a baddie from Australia ain’t no playboi carti


[Chorus]

I took her to my lair, in the Himalayas
Her boyfriend hatin' on me, got a Glock with a lazer
Ain't worried 'bout a god damn thing
I'm all about the paper
I'ma do my god damn thing, fuck all of them haters
Your momma found out you was suckin'
She like jesus save her, mmm
I may fuck that bitch, but I won't never save her, mmm
Pussy so good, damn I had to save it, mmm
Just so my lil thot can eat her out later, mmm
