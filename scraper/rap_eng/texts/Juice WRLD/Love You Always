[Chorus]
Even when I'm sleep, I feel awake
When you're away
Everything with you is such a chase, cut to the chase
Almost left my side the other day, it makes me shake
Knowin' you were gon' walk away, you can't be replaced
Can't tell you how I feel, I can't explain
For you I'ma try to get these lyrics out my brain
And for you I will fly, through the hell, through the flames
Always, always, love you always

[Verse 1]
For your love, workin' all day, fuck a off day
You lookin' cute in your Bape shit baby, you could go Ape
All of these other bitches are Sha Nae Nae, Martin like Payne
I am in love with a beautiful lady, she's in my brain
Star you set my heart on fire, 420 blaze
Yeah, no cliche, I can't explain
I got your name, tatted on my brain, tatted on my mind
Teen Titan, got the Starfire by my side
Clark Kent if she kiss me, it make me fly
Sad boy, if she leaves me it makes me cry
Flash boy, if she needs me, be there in no time
She's all right, so I gave it a go, I gave it a turn
I gave her my heart, I'm willin' to learn
And it changed my life, I'm tryna get close with the stars tonight

[Chorus]
Even when I'm sleep, I feel awake
When you're away
Everything with you is such a chase, cut to the chase
Almost left my side the other day, it makes me shake
Knowin' you were gon' walk away, you can't be replaced
Can't tell you how I feel, I can't explain
For you I'ma try to get these lyrics out my brain
And for you I will fly, through the hell, through the flames
Always, always, love you always

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
Even when I'm sleep, I feel awake
When you're away
Everything with you is such a chase, cut to the chase
Almost left my side the other day, it makes me shake
Knowin' you were gon' walk away, you can't be replaced
Can't tell you how I feel, I can't explain
For you I'ma try to get these lyrics out my brain
And for you I will fly, through the hell, through the flames
Always, always, love you always
