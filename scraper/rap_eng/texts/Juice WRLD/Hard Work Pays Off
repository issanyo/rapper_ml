[Chorus: Juice WRLD]
They say hard work pays off, I've been feeling paid off
Tryna take it then you dead, Nate Dogg
Put the chopper to your head, and take it off
Fast break, taking off, dunk on the bitch, John Wall, woah
Keep niggas on they toes
I ain't never play fair, throwin elbows
This an AK, yeah, bullet to your skull
Damn, now its blood all on my Rick Owens

[Verse 1: Juice WRLD]
Blood all on the Rick's, Rick's, Rick's, Rick's, Rick's
I'm richer than a bitch, bitch, bitch, white bitch
Blue face everywhere
Pull up, they stare
Fendi, my underwear
She suck my dick she like "Damn"
I didn't need a money counter, (Count em')
Money all over the kitchen counter
I think I need me a money counter, (Count em')
Money all over the kitchen counter
Call my doctor to handle my pain
Perky's taking my life away
I'm a bag your bitch, because I can
I'm a go take your wife away
Choppa on me Afghanistan
That bitch kill many men
Over the bag, over the cash, yeah

Over the bag, on your ass, yeah
Hoppin out the van
Switched up to the Lamb
How you niggas like me now, yeah
No limit, the gang
Try it, they gonna shoot you down, yeah
Loaded up, they gone gun you down

[Chorus: Juice WRLD]
They say hard work pays off, I've been feeling paid off
Tryna take it then you dead, Nate Dogg
Put the chopper to your head, and take it off
Fast break, taking off, dunk on the bitch, John Wall, woah
Keep niggas on they toes
I ain't never play fair, throwin elbows
This an AK, yeah, bullet to your skull
Damn, now its blood all on my Rick Owens

[Verse 2: Future]
They say hard work pays off, I've been feeling paid off
Dripping on them everyday, steak sauce
Put the chopper to your head, take it off
Fast lane, taking it off
Breaking your ankle, Chris Paul
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I'm so on 'em now my legacy will never fade
I've been traumatized before but still I'm not afraid
I done seen friends turn foe it don't amaze me
Came from the bottom of the creek that shit was ugly
Made it to the top of the mountain drankin' muddy
Everyone around me change and I feel so neglected
Hopping on the bird, with some birds, they respected (Yeah, yeah)
24/7 everyday we get it in (Yeah, yeah)
Yeah, started living out my dream, feel like I was born again

[Chorus: Juice WRLD]
They say hard work pays off, I've been feeling paid off
Tryna take it then you dead, Nate Dogg
Put the chopper to your head, and take it off
Fast break, taking off, dunk on the bitch, John Wall, woah
Keep niggas on they toes
I ain't never play fair, throwin elbows
This an AK, yeah, bullet to your skull
Damn, now its blood all on my Rick Owens
