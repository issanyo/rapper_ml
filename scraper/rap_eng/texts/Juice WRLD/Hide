[Intro: Juice WRLD]
Need a drink? (Hoo, ayy, ayy)
Found my home (Hoo, ooh, hoo, oh)
She make me leave the thrills at home and I'm fine...

[Chorus: Juice WRLD]
Really think I found my home, shorty made me feel at home
She made me leave the thrills at home and I'm fine with it
She really made me lose control, I'ma let my love unfold
We're just two lost souls, but we're fine with it

[Verse 1: Juice WRLD]
There's love at my front door, short notice
She not like the sane girls, I noticed
Think I met my soulmate, yeah, I know it
When it gets dark outside, in you I confide
You help me face my demons, I won't hide, hide
Girls like you are hard to find
I hope you don't mind, if I give you the time of your life, life, life

[Chorus: Juice WRLD]
Really think I found my home, shorty made me feel at home
She made me leave the thrills at home and I'm fine with it
She really made me lose control, I'ma let my love unfold
We're just two lost souls, but we're fine with it

[Verse 2: Seezyn]
Life is not the same with your pictures in my frame
Now that you're here, I want nothing to change
You pick me up when I'm down, I need you around
You seen me through my darkest times
Love isn't something that you try to find
You brought meaning to my life
All because of you, I do right
Because of you, I have a purpose
Fight for the world because you're worth it

[Chorus: Juice WRLD]
Really think I found my home, shorty made me feel at home
She made me leave the thrills at home and I'm fine with it
She really made me lose control, I'ma let my love unfold
We're just two lost souls, but we're fine with it
