[Intro]
Don't forget it, I ain't have love in a minute
I was on the drugs for a minute
I'm sorry
I ain't have love in a minute
I've been on drugs for a minute
I ain't hit my plug in a minute

[Hook]
I ain't have love in a minute
I've been on drugs for a minute
I ain't hit my plug in a minute
Lately I've been drownin' in my feelings

[Verse 1]
Hooked up with this bitch I met on twitter
She gon' need some love when I'm finished
She gon' need some drugs when I'm finished
Put that shit under the rug when I'm finished
She be tryna ball hard in the scrimmage
Then I tell you I don't care about practice
Run a full court press on a mattress
In the strip club, throwin' dubs, she hit back flips
Yeah I feel in love with a stripper (yeah, yeah, yeah)
In the bedroom, I'ma tip her
Fuck her off a xan, and forget her
Call the club up, tell her come and get her
Now I'm mixin' pills with the liqour
Prolly put a nigga down quicker
She don't wanna fuck, though she got a sister
I'ma hit that bitch up on twitter

[Hook]
I ain't have love in a minute
I've been on drugs for a minute
I ain't hit my plug in a minute
Lately I've been drownin' in my feelings
I ain't have love in a minute
I've been on drugs for a minute
I ain't hit my plug in a minute
Lately I've been drownin' in my feelings

[Instrumental Break]


[Hook]
I ain't have love in a minute
I've been on drugs for a minute
I ain't hit my plug in a minute
Lately I've been drownin' in my feelings
I ain't have love in a minute
I've been on drugs for a minute
I ain't hit my plug in a minute
Lately I've been drownin' in my feelings
