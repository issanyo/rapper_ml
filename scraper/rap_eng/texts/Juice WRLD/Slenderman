[Chorus]
I pop up like Slenderman
Gucci boots, I don't wear no Timberlands
Scooby Doo, bitches they be Meddlin'
Who are you? We were never ever friends
Where I'm from? I'm from Never Ever Land
Keep that cannon on my hip like Megaman
You either kill or be killed over here, Afghanistan
I pop a handful of pills, over here won't feel again
But as long as you stay real over here, you bound to win

[Verse 1]
Uhuh, yeah
Said that shit, I meant it
Uhuh, yeah
It's money over bitches
Uhuh, yeah
You niggas don't see the difference
That's why you broke and I'm rich
Because I see the difference
I spend 100k in a month, I don't got shit to show for it
But I ain't worried bout shit I know I could always make more
Racks came in, stretch it out the long way
Came a long way, from wearing Choos up in the hallways, yeah
I did it by myself, ain't had no company
Everybody get they hands out now, Fuck do you want from me?
You want the secret to my sauce, you a wannabe
You will never ever be a boss, employee

[Chorus]
I pop up like Slenderman
Gucci boots, I don't wear no Timberlands
Scooby Doo, bitches they be Meddlin'
Who are you? We were never ever friends
Where I'm from? I'm from Never Ever Land
Keep that cannon on my hip like Megaman
You either kill or be killed over here, Afghanistan
I pop a handful of pills, over here won't feel again
But as long as you stay real over here, you bound to win

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
I pop up like Slenderman
Gucci boots, I don't wear no Timberlands
Scooby Doo, bitches they be Meddlin'
Who are you? We were never ever friends
Where I'm from? I'm from Never Ever Land
Keep that cannon on my hip like Megaman
You either kill or be killed over here, Afghanistan
I pop a handful of pills, over here won't feel again
But as long as you stay real over here, you bound to win
