[Chorus]
I'm like, woah, woah, woah, woah

And she like, woah, woah, woah, woah
And I'm like, woah, woah, woah, woah

And she like, woah, woah, woah, woah
I'm like, woah, woah, woah, woah (I'm like)

[Verse 1]
Yeah, I keep sayin' "woah" cause I'm high
I'm so high I'm up in the sky
You keep talkin' shit, you could die
Killing shit, I don't even try
You know you a liar
I'm exposing these hoes
I'm exposing these bros that's not really bros
Cause them bros gotta go
Talking that shit you a ho
Talking that shit take your ho, take your ho
And then go take your ho to the hoe patch
A ho to my bro, then my bro finna scope
Like woah, he's gone
I'm balling, I'm balling like Jordan
I'm so high that I'm soaring
I might fuck your bitch in the morning
This lean I got, I keep pouring
I swear I'm the man and you know it
I swear I'm the man and you know that she know it
So now you know why that bitch gone

[Chorus]
I'm like, woah, woah, woah, woah
I'm like, woah, woah, woah, woah
And she like, woah, woah, woah, woah
And I'm like, woah, woah, woah, woah
And she like, woah, woah, woah, woah
I'm like, woah, woah, woah, woah
And she like, woah, woah, woah, woah
I'm like, woah, woah, woah, woah (I'm like)

[Verse 2]
Woah, I say that a lot
I mean it a lot, I told you I'm in it
I don't give a fuck about bitches and niggas
Just bitches and niggas, you know that that's true
And you know that I'm true
If you listen to me, I'mma listen to you
That I told you I'm preaching to you
I swear that I'm teaching to you
I'm seeing it through
I see the visions, I swear that I mean it
My nigga, you know that it's true though
All of my niggas they high
I'm another planet coolin' on Pluto
And somebody got a problem
I'm kicking shit like I major in judo
All my niggas getting money
Yes me, myself, and I
That numero uno

[Outro]
Woah, woah
You know how it go, I pull up
Woah, woah
I don't gotta reload, I shoot up
Woah, woah
You know I'm the man, hold up
Woah, woah
Let me pop the xan, hold up
