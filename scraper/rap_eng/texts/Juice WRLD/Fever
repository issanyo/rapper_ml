[Intro]
Past hoes, comin' back in the present (woah)
Past hoes, comin' back in the present

[Chorus]
She wears short skirts, she's a keeper
She don't love me, I don't either
No more drugs, I caught a fever
She don't know me, I don't either
It's been awhile since I been this gone
It's been awhile since she turned me on
Old hoes, comin' back in the present
Open up like a present
It's been awhile since I sang this song
It's been awhile since I hit your phone
Past hoes comin' back in the present

[Verse]
She don't love me, she say I'm a loser
How can I lose, when I fucked on my tutor
I told her to hold my Ruger
Cause when twelve comes, she'll be the loser
It's been awhile since I've seen your face
It's been awhile since I've been this wasted
Lookin' in the mirror and I'm startin' to see my enemy
It's been awhile since I've been this wrong
It's been awhile since you've turned me on
Liquor bringin' memories
Tryna fight the devil for some inner peace

[Chorus]
She wears short skirts, she's a keeper
She don't love me, I don't either
No more drugs, I caught a fever
She don't know me, I don't either
It's been awhile since I been this gone
It's been awhile since she turned me on
Old hoes, comin' back in the present
Open up like a present
It's been awhile since I sang this song
It's been awhile since I hit your phone
Past hoes comin' back in the present
