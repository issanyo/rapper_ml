Now she wonder why friends don't fuck with her
I just had two girls, I double up
I just had codeine, I double cup

Got two Glocks, I'm locked and I'm loaded
Driving drunk inside that Lotus
Hope the cops don't pull me over
Love to stay, but girl it's over
This is called a leaving notice
This is called a leaving notice, yeah
Got two Glocks, I'm locked and I'm loaded
Driving drunk inside that Lotus
Hope the cops don't pull me over
