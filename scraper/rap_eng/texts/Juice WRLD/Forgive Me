[Chorus]
I miss talking to you everyday
You went away and I never knew what to say
Things changed and I never really was the same
You were my best friend now I can't look you in the face
Wish I could take it back, all of the things I said
I'm still up every night, replaying it in my head
Feels like a constant fight, that I will never win
Cause I know you'll never forgive me
I miss talking to you everyday
You went away and I never knew what to say
Things changed and I never really was the same
You were my best friend now I can't look you in the face
Wish I could take it back, all of the things I said
I'm still up every night, replaying it in my head
Feels like a constant fight, that I will never win
Cause I know you'll never forgive me

[Verse]
I betrayed your trust and you were so let down
I know it still hurts you too
I cut off everyone that I ever called friend
And now I'm left with nothing
I have these lucid dreams where I turned back the time
To a better day with you
You were my best friend, never thought it would end
Now I know I can't pretend
I tried to brush it off, but it never goes away
We need to have a talk, but I don't know what to say
Leave that shit in the past, you'll just think I'm an ass
Said I was being childish and fake
I was tangled up in my drastic ways
Didn't really care for a couple of days
And now it's been a bunch of fucking days
And I still can't even say your name

[Bridge]
I fucked it all up, I just want you back
I fucked it all up, I just want you back
I fucked it all up, I just want you back
I fucked it all up again

[Chorus]
I miss talking to you everyday
You went away and I never knew what to say
Things changed and I never really was the same
You were my best friend now I can't look you in the face
Wish I could take it back, all of the things I said
I'm still up every night, replaying it in my head
Feels like a constant fight, that I will never win
Cause I know you'll never forgive me
I miss talking to you everyday
You went away and I never knew what to say
Things changed and I never really was the same
You were my best friend now I can't look you in the face
Wish I could take it back, all of the things I said
I'm still up every night, replaying it in my head
Feels like a constant fight, that I will never win
Cause I know you'll never forgive me

[Outro]
I was tangled up in my drastic ways
Didn't really care for a couple of days
And now it's been a bunch of fucking days
And I still can't even say your name
Wish I could take it back, all of the things I said
I'm still up every night, replaying it in my head
Feels like a constant fight, that I will never win
Cause I know you'll never forgive me
