[Lyrics From Snippet]

[Intro]
...ife
I need to get right
It's a long ride (Uhm)
The drugs help me high
The drugs help me high, oh

[Chorus]
I need to confide
Truelove’s hard to find
I'll wait for her to come find me
I'll even pay the flights
I need to confide
Truelove’s hard to find
I'll wait for her to come find me
I'll even pay the flight

[Verse 1]
Okay, It's been a long ride
Still the beginning of the ride
I'm gettin' high before the flights
L.A.X to the Chi
Memories on mind
Been reflecting on my life
Somethin' don't feel right
Down deep inside, I’m scared of my own demise
I need to confide to the love of my life, life
It’s getting dark outside...
