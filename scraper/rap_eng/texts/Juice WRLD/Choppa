[Intro]
Mega, you played that boy

[Hook: Juice WRLD & D Savage]
I just bought a choppa with a scope
If D Savage tell me blow, then I’ma blow
So, might wanna protect yourself
All headshots, so the vest no help
Yeah, I was just boolin’, smokin’ dope
I’ma pop this perc just to float
And I keep a bag on me (racks)
Ballin’ like an athlete

[Bridge: Juice WRLD]
I remember when they used to laugh at me
Now they want a feature, so I’m taxin’
Pull up on a nigga from the back seat
Turn this fuckin' party to a track meet

[Verse 1: D Savage]
Catch a opp gun him down, hundred rounds, fifty rounds
Make a move out of town, I was broke, but I'm up now
Bad bitches wanna fuck now, in the trap with my guns out
Niggas fu, baby, I got bills to pay
Bitch, get on your knees, bust all on her face
I go apeshit like the Bathing Ape
Cribs in different states, but no real estate
Feel like Rick Ross, how I'm pushin' weight

[Verse 2: Juice WRLD]
Feel like Rick Ross, uh
2 guns, make you jump, call 'em Kris Kross
R Kelly with funds, boy, you pissed off
So get pissed on, ballin' out like a '89 Piston
Aye, VVS up on my wrist, just watch it glisten
I don't really see no competition, aye
Me and D Savage water whippin' in the kitchen, aye
Ain't no Popeyes over here, but we got chickens, aye

[Hook: Juice WRLD & D Savage]
I just bought a choppa with a scope
If D Savage tell me blow, then I’ma blow
So, might wanna protect yourself
All headshots, so the vest no help
Yeah, I was just boolin’, smokin’ dope (brr)
I’ma pop this perc just to float
And I keep a bag on me
Ballin’ like an athlete
