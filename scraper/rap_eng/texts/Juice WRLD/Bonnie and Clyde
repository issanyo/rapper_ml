[Chorus]
Missed the days I woke up, you were next to me (yeah)
Get a quick reply when you be textin me (yeah)
And you always keep it real, don't gotta flex to me (yeah)
So no matter where I go, I'll always need you by my side
Yeah you're down to ride
Bonnie and Clyde
If a nigga try to take you, straight homicide
That's on my life
Just be my wife

[Verse: 1]
Let me come and sweep you right up off your feet (aye)
I'm so used to sadness, that shit follows me (aye)
Happiness you bring, baby be my queen
Yeah I know these demons comin' after me (aye)
With you in my arms, I ain't worried bout a thing
Can't get enough of your kisses, baby I miss it
When I'm around you I fit in, usually feel like a misfit
I know we just met, but baby this is different
You're so self-sufficient, choke you like submissive (aye)
Baby if I said it, then I fuckin' meant it (aye)
I will never treat you bad like these other niggas (aye)
I know these perscriptions got a nigga trippin (aye)
But on the real, I'm tryna overdose on you

[Chorus]
Missed the days I woke up, you were next to me (yeah)
Get a quick reply when you be textin me (yeah)
And you always keep it real, don't gotta flex to me (yeah)
So no matter where I go, I'll always need you by my side
Yeah you're down to ride
Bonnie and Clyde
If a nigga try to take you, straight homicide
That's on my life
Just be my wife

[Verse: 2]
Let me show you something you ain't ever seen (aye)
Got me cuffed up like a felony (aye)
Hit it from the back, that shit heavenly (aye)
Now we in the groove like the 70's (aye)
Won't take no call, still pickin up your phone calls
Baby I'm a beast
Girl you got me in a world that's drama free
All these other hoes, they be wanna-be's
I don't wanna be with nobody except you, you, you

[Chorus]
Missed the days I woke up, you were next to me (yeah)
Get a quick reply when you be textin me (yeah)
And you always keep it real, don't gotta flex to me (yeah)
So no matter where I go, I'll always need you by my side
Yeah you're down to ride
Bonnie and Clyde
If a nigga try to take you, straight homicide
That's on my life
Just be my wife
I'll give you the world to have you next to me
