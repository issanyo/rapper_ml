[Hook]
I don't wanna lose, I don’t wanna lose you
Turn into a swimming pool
Turn this Hennessy into a swimming pool, pool

[Verse]
Now I’m drowning, I am not aware of my surroundings
You used to make me feel perfect, and now I am a whole different person
I dont wanna lose, I don’t wanna lose
Turn this Hennessy into a swimming pool
I keep going down misery avenue, I keep driving down misery avenue
Don't know what to do
Love is such a war, Ima call a truce
Taking all my demons in this fucking booth
Ima just keep it bool, But I can’t keep my cool
Cause, yeah, I don't wanna lose
You keep me on my ps & qs, You keep me on my ps & qs
Life is a race and I’m in last place, everything turned gray
Shit is not straight, Shit is not ok
Your in my way, but you make my day
And I see the love fade, I see the love fade
I always throw shade, and it's coming your way
Cause it’s not ok, yeah it’s not ok, it’s not ok
Ima deal with it, life is hard to swallow take a pill with it
Looking for a new girl to have now, who gon hold me down
I said I’m Looking for a new girl to have now, who gon hold me down
In the studio, hit it twice to go girl feel like coolio
That's yo ex cool, that's my newest ho
Fuck one I need two of those

[Hook]
I dont wanna lose, I don’t wanna lose
Turn this Hennessy into a swimming pool
I dont wanna fucking lose, Turn this Hennessy into a swimming pool
Turn this Hennessy into a swimming pool

[Outro]
I don't wanna lose
I don't wanna lose
I don't wanna lose
