[Chorus]
40 with a 30 thats a dick, no stop, pause
Talkin' all that shit and get your ass popped off
Got your bitch doin’ cocaine 'till she lockjaw
Only did it once don't know how it feels, you should ask her
Life of a rockstar rap trapper
Keep me a guitar, AR, and a tractor
Only see the snakes in the grass when I ride through (hiss hiss)
Got my nine, pull up, blow it like a drive through

[Verse 1]
Your bitch is an Xbox, play her like game room
I was tweakin’ off the percs, mix it with the shrooms
Now I'm itchin' seein' shadows in my fuckin' room (lucid dreams)
Cute chocolate bitch, thats a fuckin' Reeses
Heard her nigga was talkin' shit, pull on him and crease him
Snort the molly off her tits, energy increasin'
Replenish me, prevent from finishing, when I beat, uh
Rollie on my wrist, did it for the season
Then I put a Patek on my wrist, for no fuckin’ reason
Automatic in my grip, got it for a reason
If a nigga try to take my shit, imma leave him bleedin’

[Chorus]
40 with a 30 thats a dick, no stop, pause
Talkin' all that shit and get your ass popped off
Got your bitch doin’ cocaine 'till she lockjaw
Only did it once don't know how it feels, you should ask her
Life of a rockstar rap trapper
Keep me a guitar, AR, and a tractor
Only see the snakes in the grass when I ride through (hiss hiss)
Got my nine, pull up, blow it like a drive through

[Verse 2]
I'm ballin’ out while you sittin on the bleachers
Get rich just to go back and fuck on my teachers
None of them believed in me
Now they hit my twitter congratulating me
Nigga I don't fuck with y'all people
Old hoes hit me, I'm sorry
I wasn't tryin' to lie to y'all either
Yeah, I dont need 'em
Pretty bitch, good facial features
Three blunts to the face then I eat her
Two percs to the face, I'm geekin'
Gotta put them down I'm tweakin'
Sometimes it feels like I need them
Sometimes I feel so defeated
My mind be racing like damn
"What the fuck is Juice WRLD thinking?"
Momma told me I look happy
I told her clean her glasses

[Chorus]
40 with a 30 thats a dick, no stop, pause
Talkin' all that shit and get your ass popped off
Got your bitch doin' cocaine 'till she lockjaw
Only did it once don't know how it feels, you should ask her
Life of a rockstar rap trapper
Keep me a guitar, AR, and a tractor
Only see the snakes in the grass when I ride through (hiss hiss)
Got my nine, pull up, blow it like a drive through
