[Lyrics From Snippet]
Uh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Uh, I try to be everything that I can
But sometimes I come out as being nothin'
I try to be everything that I can
But sometimes I come out as being nothin’
I pray to god that he make me a better man
Uh, maybe one day Im'ma stand for something
I'm beggin’ god that he made you part of the plan
I guess I ain't go through all that hell for nothin'
I'm always fucking up and wrecking shit, It seems like I perfected it
Offer you my love, I hope you take it like some medicine
You tell me, ain't nobody better than me
I think that there's better than me
Hope you see the better in me
Always end up bettering me
I don't wanna ruin this one
This type of love don't always come and go
I don’t wanna ruin this one
This type of love don’t always come and go
We take drugs then you hold me close-
