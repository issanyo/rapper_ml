(Hook: Juice WRLD)
(Yeah, Aye) She do coke while I sip codeine
Rap game, crack game, serving to the dope fiend
She like court side, still catchin' nosebleed
9-1-1, this bitch boutta’ OD

Passed out on my couch, someone take her out
Medics in n' out, tellin' her "breathe in n' out"
Neighbors nosy than a bitch, askin' me what this about?
Shorty took too many drugs, tryna overdose for clout

(Verse: Juice WRLD)
Molly on her tongue got her goin' dumb
She older than me, she know that I'm young
But I'm not young and dumb
Fuck a bitch, get a bitch sprung
Pull up on the scene, they run
I pull out my gun
Heater on me
Kinda like the sun, bitch I'm not the one

Fuck with me, choppa’ give you smoke like a chimney
Jiminy, cricket how they jumpin' on my wave, B
It's crazy, now I'm makin' money on the daily
I'd be hatin' on me too, if I wasn't gettin' paid (yuh)

I'd be hatin' on me too, if I wasn't gettin' laid (uh)
On a daily basis, on a daily basis
Presidential brain from your main, Sarah Palin
Tryna’ judge a nigga, you don't even got a bailiff

(Hook: Juice WRLD)
She do coke while I sip codeine

She like court side, still catchin' nosebleed
9-1-1, this bitch boutta OD
Passed out on my couch, someone take her out
Medics in and out, tellin' her "breathe in and out"
Neighbors nosier than a bitch, askin' me "what this about?"
Shorty took too many drugs, tryna overdose for clout

(Verse: CincoTheFlexGod)
*Lil $torm, Yeah*

In this world, I got the juice
For you, there’s no use
Diamonds on my neck
Hitting like abuse
Sorry I can’t lose

Hit her once, throw up the deuce
Wings all on my shoes
Fucked around, dropped my roof
Who you?
I don’t have a clue
Let me introduce

Little $torm
But don’t get it twisted, bitch i’m wavy
Crazy
How these niggas really actin’ shady
Free my brother, 12 be on his back like he Tom Brady (Slatt, Slatt, Slatt, Free Jett3ye!)
Lately
I been seeing water like the navy

Ice on my neck and its frozen
Cinco, the one that was chosen
Can you call 9-1-1?
All of my pockets are swollen
Look like I got a promotion

I know she was sleeping on me
Now she be having wet dreams
Cinco was born with the sauce
That shit be all in my genes

(Hook: Juice WRLD)
