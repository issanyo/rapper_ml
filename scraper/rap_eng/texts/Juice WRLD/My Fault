[Intro]
Oh
Oh-ohh-oh
She told me that it's all my fault
It woulda been a right and not another wrong (Huh)

[Chorus]
She told me that it's all my fault, it woulda been perfect all along
It woulda been a right and not another wrong
And it would be a happy not a sad song, oh
Cause it's all my fault, she would have been perfect on her own
I should have took a right but I took a wrong
And now this ain't a happy it's a sad song, oh

[Verse]
She like a mouse in a mouse trap, stuck up
She got me rolling weed now, I fucked up
You talking too much, so shut the fuck up
You heated too much, you're high, the sum up
I'll let you cool down
And I brought you round momma
But you let me down, yeah you let me drown in drama
You talking too much, so shut the fuck up
You talking too much, so shut the fuck up
You talking too much, so shut the fuck up
You talking too much, so shut the fuck up
I'll let you cool down
And I brought you round momma
But you let me down, yeah you let me drown in drama

[Chorus]
She told me that it's all my fault, it woulda been perfect all along
It woulda been a right and not another wrong
And it would be a happy not a sad song, oh
Cause it's all my fault, she would of been perfect on her own
I should have took a right but I took a wrong
And now this ain't a happy it's a sad song, oh

[Bridge]
She told me thats it's all my fault
It would of been a right and not another wrong
And it would be a happy not a sad song
Cause it's all my fault
She woulda been perfect on her own
And now this ain't a happy it's a sad song

[Chorus]
She told me that it's all my fault, it woulda been perfect all along
It woulda been a right and not another wrong
And it would be a happy not a sad song, oh
Cause it's all my fault, she would of been perfect on her own
I should have took a right but I took a wrong
And now this ain't a happy it's a sad song, oh
