Who gone' hold me down
Who gone' hold me down
Who gone' hold me down

[Chorus]
Money come around
Money go around
Who gone' hold me down
Who gone' hold me down
When I’m not around they be talkin' down
When I come around they don’t make a sound
Money come around
Money go around
Who gone' hold me down
Who gone' hold me down
When I’m not around they be talkin' down
When I come around they don’t make a sound

[Verse 1]
Tell me you, tell me you
Tell me that you here for me, is it true
Tell me you’ll be there for me, when I’m low
Tell me that you’ll care for me, when I’m cold
I don’t wanna leave
But I gotta leave, I gotta go
Tell me what you see
When you look at me and all this gold
Boy I look like money now
Pull up and I’m stuntin' now
[?] comin' now
Baby they’ll just hold me down
Told you that I run it now
I know that you love it now
I told her I do this for real and that boy make believe
Flexin' on my ex she call me Hercules
Niggas wanna hate but they not hurtin' me
And I don’t work for money money work for me

[Chorus]
Money come around
Money go around
Who gone' hold me down
Who gone' hold me down
When I’m not around they be talkin' down
When I come around they don’t make a sound
Money come around
Money go around
Who gone' hold me down
Who gone' hold me down
When I’m not around they be talkin' down
When I come around they don’t make a sound

[Verse 2]
Yo bitch outta date she goin' outta style
She ain’t know me then I bet she know me now
She ain’t love me then I bet she love me now
And if she ain’t fuck me then then she can’t fuck me now
Too much on my plate Too much in my face, okay
I’m not down to earth catch me outer space, okay
Two girls in my face that’s a double date
Goyard on my waist cost a couple k
Boy I look like money now
Pull up and I’m stuntin' now
[?] comin' now
Baby girl just hold me down
Told you that I run it now
I know that you love it now
I told her I do this for real and that boy make believe
Flexin' on my ex she call me Hercules
Niggas wanna hate but they not hurtin' me
And I don’t work for money money work for me

[Chorus]
Money come around
Money go around
Who gone' hold me down
Who gone' hold me down
When I’m not around they be talkin' down
When I come around they don’t make a sound
Money come around
Money go around
Who gone' hold me down
Who gone' hold me down
When I’m not around they be talkin' down
When I come around they don’t make a sound

[Outro]
Who gone' hold me down
