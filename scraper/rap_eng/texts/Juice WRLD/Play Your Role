[Intro]
Ayy, play your role
Play, your, role

[Chorus]
Play your role, like an actor in a movie
Roll up, let the backwood soothe me
Loaded up, if a fuck nigga try me
She say that I'm too damn high for her liking
Play your role, like an actor in a movie
Roll up, let the backwood soothe me
Loaded up, if a fuck nigga try me
She say that I'm too damn high for her liking

[Verse: 1]
Keep her checked like Nike, Shoes too pricy
Move with the tool, so the dudes won't fight me
In the groove, with the crew, so the hoes still like me
I'ma do what I do, cause my neck still icy
Woah, keep a choker with a .45, woah
Run up on me, you gon' die tonight, woah
Save the drama for another time, woah
We'll leave a nigga traumatized

[Chorus]
Play your role, like an actor in a movie
Roll up, let the backwood soothe me
Loaded up, if a fuck nigga try me
She say that I'm too damn high for her liking
Play your role, like an actor in a movie
Roll up, let the backwood soothe me
Loaded up, if a fuck nigga try me
She say that I'm too damn high for her liking

[Verse: 2]
And I'm too damn cool
It ain't my fault, Raf Simons on my shoes
I won't lose
Hoes gon' be hoes, bitches gon' do what they do
I hate you, and you hate me so the feeling is mutual
I got guns, and funds to do whatever the fuck I want to
These hoes tell lies, so she lyin' when she tellin' you that she bein truthful
Go sell my drugs, or count my money bitch, make yourself useful
I think she had enough of that
So when she call me, I don't think I'm callin' back
All girls are the same, don't know how to act
So sell my drugs and make yourself useful

[Chorus]
Play your role, like an actor in a movie
Roll up, let the backwood soothe me
Loaded up, if a fuck nigga try me
She say that I'm too damn high for her liking
Play your role, like an actor in a movie
Roll up, let the backwood soothe me
Loaded up, if a fuck nigga try me
She say that I'm too damn high for her liking
