[Chorus: Juice WRLD & Tmmrw]
Yeah, I hate to say it but I fell in love again
We need a vacation, so we took a trip to France
I just spent 2000 on a shirt and pair of pants
If you niggas couldn't tell I'm never going broke again
I love poppin' percys, that's my baby, love the xans
Had to cover up, can't do that single shit again
I really love her style, but I really hate her friends
They be hatin' outside the club when they can't even get in (Tmmrw)

[Verse 1: Tmmrw]
Look at me now like Chris Brown (yeah, yeah)
I'm a king, that's my queen, better bow down (better bow down)
She pop a bean for the team, she so high now (she so high now), oh yeah
Come through when she not around (not around), yeah
I'm just playin' babe
You know I'm here to stay
This is real love
Don't tell me that it's fake
She want some real drugs, (no no no)
Not the fake percs (yeah, yeah)
She wants a real one (no)
I remember I was caught up in my feelings (my feelings)
All these women start to look like evil villains (evil villians)
She said the way you act you movin' way so different (was so different)
And we so distant (ah, nah, nah)
And now I'm missing (yeah)
All our tension baby

[Chorus: Juice WRLD & Tmmrw]
Yeah, I hate to say it but I fell in love again (fell in love again)
We need a vacation, so we took a trip to France (took a trip to France)
I just spent 2000 on a shirt and pair of pants (pair of pants)
If you niggas couldn't tell I'm never going broke again (yeah, goin' broke)
I love poppin' percys, that's my baby, love the xans (yeah, yeah)
Had to cover up, can't do that single shit again (oh no no no)
I really love her style, but I really hate her friends
They be hatin' outside the club when they can't even get in (no)

[Verse 2: Tmmrw]
All you ever cared about was all the money I would spend (yeah)
And you were so distracted, you just wanted this to end (you did)
And I was riding for you baby, you was riding trends (yeah, yeah)
But everytime I see you, I just fall in love again (oh yeah)
And I've been waiting like a stand still, am I your man still
You trashed me like a landfill, burns like a candle (no no no)
You did this way to often, I'm buried me in a coffin (yeah)
I thought that I was hard, but you knew that I would soften (on what)
You told me I don't wanna live like this (no no no)
No I don't wanna live the life I live (no no no)
You told me I don't wanna live like this (on what)
But baby I don't really give a shit (a shit)

[Chorus: Juice WRLD]
Yeah, I hate to say it but I fell in love again
We need a vacation, so we took a trip to France
I just spent 2000 on a shirt and pair of pants
If you niggas couldn't tell I'm never going broke again
I love poppin' percy, that's my baby, love the xans
Had to cover up, can't do that single shit again
I really love her style, but I really hate her friends
They be hatin' outside the club when they can't even get in

[Outro: Tmmrw]
I remember I was caught up in my feelings
All these women start to look like evil villains
I remember I was caught up in my feelings
All these women start to look like evil villains
