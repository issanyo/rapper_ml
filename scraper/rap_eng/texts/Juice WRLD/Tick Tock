[Chorus]
I don't got the time for a bitch (tick, tock)
I don't got a dime for a bitch (wrist watch)
Percocet I pop, make me itch (get off)
She was in my mind, like a tick (get off)
I don't got the time for a bitch (tick, tock)
I don't got a dime for a bitch (wrist watch)
Percocet I pop, make me itch (get off)
She was in my mind, like a tick (yeah)

[Verse 1]
That bitch in my head, parasite
Pull up in that ghost, Poltergeist
Triple 9 my shit, fuck the pastors wife
Pull up with the pipe, shoot em 40 times
He don't want no smoke, cancerous
Prolly smoke him like a cancer stick
Give me head, no psychiatrist
Pulled up with that choppa, let it hit
You a clown, you a clown, it
Playin' tag with that gun, you're it
Get the cash, fuck these hoes, that's it
Pockets fat, lookin like Norbit

[Chorus]
I don't got the time for a bitch (tick, tock)
I don't got a dime for a bitch (wrist watch)
Percocet I pop, make me itch (get off)
She was in my mind, like a tick (get off)
I don't got the time for a bitch (tick, tock)
I don't got a dime for a bitch (wrist watch)
Percocet I pop, make me itch (get off)
She was in my mind, like a tick (yeah)

[Verse 2]
Now I got these labels on my dick, right
If it ain't 50 million, that shit hit, right
Cause every song I make, that shit a hit, right
And see every song I make, I get a bitch, right
I should count how many songs I have
Cause that's how many bitches that's gon' pull up and get smashed
See I'm gon' ball so hard, I feel like Kevin, no Durant
You know I'm doin' everything they said that I can't, I'm the man
Money in rubber bands, ran through 20 bands, that shit ain't even stand a chance
Keep a white mask, no Ku Klux Klan
Bet you never seen a drive by, in a Sprinter Van

[Chorus]
I don't got the time for a bitch (tick, tock)
I don't got a dime for a bitch (wrist watch)
Percocet I pop, make me itch (get off)
She was in my mind, like a tick (get off)
I don't got the time for a bitch (tick, tock)
I don't got a dime for a bitch (wrist watch)
Percocet I pop, make me itch (get off)
She was in my mind, like a tick (yeah)
