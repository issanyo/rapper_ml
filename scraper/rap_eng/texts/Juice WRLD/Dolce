[Verse 2: BB Knight]
Baby girl bust 'cause the money great
Wanna love, take me on a money date
New cash and I get it every way
Rack it up, baby girl, put it in the safe
Invest in my mama, got options
Helmut Lang in my closet, no problem
Big Glock, meet the Pippi Longstocking
I'm Batman, Bruce Wayne, no Robin
Nitrous, out the Hellcat rocket
I know you wanna ride, no problem
She going anywhere for some dollars
Ask Juice what she do for some commas
Shake that ass, shake that ass, don't stop it
Beam on the silencer of the yopper
Let me show you how to smoke gas proper
Gelato stuffed all in Fronto
Air it out, Phantom of Opera
Gone head and kick down your front door
If my hush mans really gotta solve it
Life is like some dice, it get tricky
And I think little choosy tryna pick me
But I'm tryna make bands, make history
Don't know what to think when you miss me

[Outro: BB Knight]
Aye, don't know what to think when I'm thinking 'bout you
But you okay, yeah, aye
Don't know what to think when I'm thinking 'bout you
But you okay, you okay, but you okay, yuh
