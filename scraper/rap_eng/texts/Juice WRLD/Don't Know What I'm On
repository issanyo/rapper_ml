[Intro]
She know, I know
She know, I know

[Chorus]
I don't know what you've been told, but I'm getting higher
I don't know what you've been told, but I
I don't know the lies you tell, she's lyin'
I'm too drunk right now, no I can't drive
I don't know what you've been told, but I know
It's okay to get a little high
I don't know what you've been on, but I'm going, I'm going
On my way to dancing in the sky
On my way to dancing in the sky
She told me that I'm not her type of guy

[Verse 1]
She don't know, no she don't know what I'm on
She just said that she can't match my flight
They don't know the drugs that I'm on, yeah I know
Bae, I need a minute give me some time
They don't know, I told you that they don't know
They don't know, they don't know what I know
They don't know, I'm tellin' you that they don't know
They don't know, they don't know what I'm on
They don't know what I'm on

[Chorus]
I don't know what you've been told, but I'm getting higher
I don't know what you've been told, but I
I don't know the lies you tell, she's lying
I'm too drunk right now, no I can't drive
I don't know what you've been told, but I know
It's okay to get a little high
I don't know what you've been on, but I'm going, I'm going
On my way to dancing in the sky

[Verse 2]
I'm too drunk right now yeah

I can't feel my face when I'm with you
I'm too drunk you know what I want
5 more shots with Oxycodone
Now I can't feel my face when I'm with you

[Bridge]
I get so damn high that I can't move
I get so damn high don't know what to do
I'm too drunk right now yeah
I want 5 more shots with Oxycodone, I can't feel my face
I can't feel my face when I'm with you
I'm too drunk right now, no I can't drive

[Chorus]
I don't know what you've been told, but I know
It's okay to get a little high
I don't know what you've been on, but I'm going, I'm going
On my way to dancing in the sky
