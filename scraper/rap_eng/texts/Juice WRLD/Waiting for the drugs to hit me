[Intro]
Waiting for the drugs to hit me (Oh)

[Chorus]
Waiting for the drugs to hit me
Went to LA for 2 weeks I know my momma miss me
I'm so fucking paranoid I came back with a semi
Tote the Glock in my designer gon' get pretty ricky
Shoot a nigga in his face I never show no pity
When she stab me in my heart she never show no pity
Codeine in my cup I carry it to every city
She told me that she wanna go to hell with me, go to hell with me

[Verse]
You know that I show no pity
So I fuck her and I tell her that she comin' with me
Sippin' liquor till my liver spinnin' round my kidney
My ex bitch say that's karma come and fucking get me
Bitch come fucking get me
All i know is get high, just to get by
I got mob ties, bitch I got gang ties
And your blood get baptized, and your blood get baptized
I heard you were talking shit well this'll be the last time
We be throwin' xanny fits until we go to nap time
I was never up in school, I always hated class time
I feel like Kobe Bryant how i'm jumpin' from the baseline
Call me from my trap phone, bitch I hate FaceTime

[Chorus]
Waiting for the drugs to hit me
Went to LA for 2 weeks I know my momma miss me
I'm so fucking paranoid I came back with a semi
Tote the Glock in my designer gon' get pretty ricky
Shoot a nigga in his face I never show no pity
When she stab me in my heart she never show no pity
Codeine in my cup I carry it to every city
She told me that she wanna go to hell with me, go to hell with me
