[Lyrics from Snippet]

[Intro]
Cardo-Got-Wings

[Chorus]
Wouldn't happen any other way
Wake up gettin' money every day
Remember I had racks in my basement
Now, I be in Cali every day of vacation
Still takin' drugs to the face
Pills full of thrills, take your cell phone away
Rob your [?] bar for a day
I bet you'd kill to be me a for a day

[Verse 1: Juice WRLD]
Take one pipe, 3 all to the face (oh, oh)
Scratch my problems away
Callin' up the gang isn't a problem today
[?]
Took your bitch in Cali you take L's in LA
I just want the Rollie with the diamonds in the face
[?]
Wear it around my neck so I look pretty when I spray
I'mma call you down money gang still pourin' up
If I tell him you're a problem he gon' fuck you up
He told me I ain't give a [?] I said he's fucking bugs
We gon' run it up
We gon' run it up
So much cash we gon' need a dump truck
Tryna rob me, you're such a dumb fuck
That bitch say she love me she's such a dumb slut
Said he wants to kill me I said nigga what's up?
I said

[Chorus]
Wouldn't happen any other way
Wake up gettin' money every day
Remember I had racks in my basement
Now, I be in Cali every day of vacation
Still takin' drugs to the face
Pills full of thrills, take your cell phone away
Rob your [?] bar for a day
I bet you'd kill to be me a for a day

[Verse 2: Juice WRLD]
You would probably kill me if you had the chance (huh)
Probably 'cause I spend a couple thou on pants (huh)
Probably 'cause I got your bitch the dirty dance (huh)
Fuck her then I leave her call me Dirty Dan (huh)
She scratch your head like she got dandruff
You is my son like my Sefrin
Hatin' niggas turn me into Bruce Banners
I ain't Megaman but I got 2 cannons
Keep a few cannons
Soundin' like a drumline, nigga, Nick Cannon
Say she had a fun time, cocaine dancin'
She wanna go to hell tonight, Marilyn Manson
Marilyn Monroe, I fuck on a white hoe

[Chorus]
Wouldn't happen any other way
Wake up gettin' money every day
Remember I had racks in my basement
Now, I be in Cali every day of vacation
Still takin' drugs to the face
Pills full of thrills, take your cell phone away
Rob your [?] bar for a day
I bet you'd kill to be me a for a day
