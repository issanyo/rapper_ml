[Chorus]
I've been to three cities in the last two weeks
I fucked a few hoes that I met on the internet
They tried to impress me with the Gucci shoes
Bitch I ain't really into that
Hotel room start to look like a runway
Save no hoe Friday, fuck a Sunday
I know, I know she wants me for my clothes my Dior lookin' lovely

[Verse]
Four white hoes in the back of the Humvee
Knives to the back all these hoes wanna cut me
All girls are the same, pretty hoes still ugly
No good for me, no good for me
In the last three weeks, I've been to three cities tryna find these freaks, I know
It's wrong and heartbreak is real, but so are the pills
So I cannot feel whole
No good for me, no good for me
No good for me, no good, no good
They adore me, but they don't love me
They adore me, but they don't love me
She rock Off-White, straight from the source
Clothes brand new, you ain't seen them before
She know I got the juice, 2Pac Shakur
Lean got her passed out on the floor
I need some more
I'm getting bored of the same old drugs and the same old hoes
I need something for my nose

(No good for me, no good
No good for me, no good)

[Chorus]
Been to three cities in the last three weeks
Fucked a few hoes that I met on the internet
Couple of these hoes tried to impress me
Got Gucci shoes, look bitch I ain't into that
My bedroom starting to look like a runway
Save no hoe Friday, fuck a Sunday
I know, I know she want me for my clothes my Dior lookin' lovely
