[Lyrics From Snippet]

[Chorus]
She told me that we perfect
So if we break up, I'm gon' turn into a circuit
She got a new nigga, well I'll be in their bushes lurkin'
When, what? With a .40, what I'm gon' do?
Im'ma merk 'em

[Verse]
Uh, that's a play on play, close the curtains
All this heart break shit blow like his name curtains
All she ever do is do blow and make me nervous
This a AP, not a Hugh Blow
But let me stay focused
A lot, a lot of you know, if you leave me
You're asking for the gun smoke
This is real, no cap, baby, no joke
You are my home, crack a smile when your name surfaces on my phone
Remember when I was in Europe, we was in a different time zone
Conversations, what we still made time for
By the way, I pop molly
I don't rock Tom Ford
My hobbies are catching bodies, riding bikes and skate boards
It's the 'gram life, look at juice move, girl
Some of yall is really fucking with this new girl
But some of yall are like "fuck her" that's his new girl
Like who the hell invited her to live in juice world?
I think Juice WRLD invited her to live in juice world
That's juice girl, nigga, that's not your girl
So with that being said
I'm holding her close, I'm taking off clothes
I'm taking her soul, I'm letting her know
That she really make me whole

[Chorus]
She told me that we perfect
So if we break up, I'm gon' turn into a circuit
She got a new nigga, well I'll be in their bushes lurkin'
When, what? With a .40, what I'm gon' do?
Im'ma merk 'em
She told me that we perfect (that we perfect)
So if we break up, I'm gon' turn into a circuit
She got a new nigga, well I'll be in their bushes lurkin'
