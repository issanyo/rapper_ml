[Part I: Golden]

[Intro]
Go-golden
Go-golden
I told her she could leave when the sun shine
Last night, yeah, we had us a good time
Now she in that Uber with a sad face
Tattoos on her body, I got bad taste

[Chorus]
Told her she could leave when the sun shine
Last night, yeah, we had us a good time
Now she in that Uber with a sad face
Tattoos on her body, I got bad taste
She was all the way from the north side
One ride, just to fuck for the one time
Told her come and ride it like she stole it
You may be poison, but that pussy golden

[Bridge]
Golden, golden, golden, golden
You may be poison but that pussy golden
You may be poison but that pussy golden
Go-golden

[Verse]
She my ride around (go-golden)
She not from my side of town (go-golden)
I may bring her 'round (go-golden)
Yeah, shawty chosen
Heart cold, frozen
She gon' break it down, bust it open
Go another round, keep stroking
Now she feelin' heart broken
Cause she ain't worth a dime, like a game token
She gon' break it down, bust it open
Go another round, keep stroking
Now she feelin' heart broken
She ain't worth a dime, like a game token

[Chorus]
Told her she could leave when the sun shine
Last night, yeah, we had us a good time
Now she in that Uber with a sad face
Tattoos on her body, I got bad taste
She was all the way from the north side
One ride, just to fuck for the one time
Told her come and ride it like she stole it
You may be poison but that pussy golden

[Outro]
Go-golden
Go-golden
Go-golden
Yeah, shawty chosen
Heart cold, frozen


[Part II: Get Away]

[Intro]
You ain't safe by me, I will play you

[Chorus]
All the way, all the way, all the way there
I don't play, I don't play, I don't play fair
I'm away, in my ways, and I stay there
Get my way, get my way, with my ways, yeah
All the way, all the way, all the way there
I don't play, I don't play, I don't play fair
I'm away, in my ways, and I stay there
Get my way, get my way, with my ways, yeah

[Verse]
Get away from me, get away, uhh
You ain't safe by me, I will play you
If your man bring you 'round, I will take you
Take you to the condo to taste you
Next day, I replace you
Heartbreak, I will waste you
Everything feeling so unstable
Don't you love it when I turn the tables

[Outro]
All the way there
I don't play fair
You ain't safe by me, I will play you
