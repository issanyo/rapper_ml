[Chorus]
She love me like the dope man
She don't like poppas, she still a coke fiend
I've been ballin' just like Calvin Cambridge
She ask what I need, need, I need brain bitch
But she love me like the dope man
She don't like poppas, she still a coke fiend
I've been ballin' out like Calvin Cambridge
She say what you need, need, I need brain bitch

[Verse]
All the love, love shit, I don't need it
Treat her like the change, you can keep it
Hoes all the same, no difference
Moods change like the seasons
I need the bitch to hide the pills for us
These bitches think they real for us
But would they really kill for us?
I doubt it
Won't even hide the pills for us
What makes you think she'll kill for us?
What makes you think she'll feel for us?
I doubt it

[Chorus]
She love me like the dope man
She don't like poppas, she still a coke fiend
I've been ballin' just like Calvin Cambridge
She ask what I need, need, I need brain bitch
But she love me like the dope man
She don't like poppas, she still a coke fiend
I've been ballin' out like Calvin Cambridge
She say what you need, need, I need brain bitch
