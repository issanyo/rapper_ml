I heard that's your shorty, that's my barbie (That's my barbie)
I met her in the party, she got naughty (She got naughty)

She told me she could feel it in her tummy (Yaa)
Chillin' in my Raf piece (Raf Piece)
You ain't got these (Got these)
I should charge these niggas just to watch me (Just to watch me)
Ice around my wrist just like some hockey (Freeze, Freeze)
She gon' ride it like a Kawasaki (Skrrt off)

[Verse 1]
She gon' ride it like a motorcycle (Skrt, Skrt, Skrrt Off)
She said she gon' pop off like a rifle (Ooo)
She can have whatever, whatever, just not a title (Not a title)
Now make that money stack just like the Eiffel (Green, Green)
Touch down in that end zone, never fumble (Oh)
Lyin' in the jungle (Ya)
Rebel, heavy metal, you can hear the crowd jump (Ya)
She gon' take that Adderall to get her heart pumpin' (Ya)
Now we started something (Ya)
Fuck her then I let her go (Then I let her go)
Give her molly she 'ill never know (She 'ill never know)
She my little private show
I just hope she doesn't overdose (Doesn't overdose)

No, don't overdo it (No)
Fuck me in this super-ride, come take this wood (Woah)
Every day we gettin' high, come roll this wood (Ohh)
Listen to the story-line, it's getting good
