[Chorus]
I'm in my black Benz
Doin' cocaine with my black friends
We'll be high as hell before the night ends, yeah
Before the night ends
Before the night ends

Switch up to the white Benz
Doin' codeine with my white friends
We'll be high as hell before the night ends, yeah
Before the night ends
Before the night begins

[Verse 1]
Lord have mercy
I know that these perkys finna hurt me
Sometimes I feel like they doin' surgery, ayy
Tell me, are they workin'? Are they workin'?
Tell me, are they workin'?

I party too damn much
And you niggas can't keep up
Too fucked up, too fucked up
Yeah, I'm too fucked up
Won't look up til' the sun come up
Pills with the Hennessy, I might throw up
I might throw up, yeah

[Chorus]
I'm in my black Benz
Doin' cocaine with my black friends
We'll be high as hell before the night ends, yeah
Before the night ends
Before the night ends

Switch up to the white Benz
Doin' codeine with my white friends
We'll be high as hell before the night ends, yeah
Before the night ends
Before the night begins

[Verse 2]
Let's go the party 'gain, again
Let's go to the party day and night
I promise you, I will never ever kill your vibe
'cause I know how it feels to be lonely at the night

Let's go the party 'gain, again
Let's go to the party day and night
I promise you, I will never ever kill your vibe
'cause I know how it feels to be lonely at the night

Please, baby
Coming back on me
'cause you know I want Ì¶
Never set you free
You're the one that always walking on my mind
Even though I woke up, won't leave me behind

You're the one that I want, you're the one that I want
There's no other girl that can replace you, can replace you

You're the one that I want, you're the one that I want
There's no other girl can replace you, can replace you

[Chorus]
I'm in my black Benz
Doin' cocaine with my black friends
We'll be high as hell before the night ends, yeah
Before the night ends
Before the night ends

Switch up to the white Benz
Doin' codeine with my white friends
We'll be high as hell before the night ends, yeah
Before the night ends
Before the night begins
