Snippet

[Hook]
I feel the worst, but I'm still wishing you the best
Every morning woke up mad at me, reminding me of my past
Seems as though I'm only good at one thing, making you upset, uh
Treat me like a pest, then wonder why I left
I'm getting tired of all this stressin', unable to rest
Wonderin' what type of bullshit you'll get mad at next
I ain't even wanna do it, but I had to, shit I was glad to
You was shooting at me with your words, so I stabbed you

[Verse 1]
Die just, die just
This lil' heart of mine, I won't let you smash it
Burn me up inside, turn me into ashes
Why, why
This lil' soul of mine, won't let it get intertwined
With somebody I, always fail to realize that
They were never mine, they were never ever mine
I was just a part in her pics, they get processed
This lil' soul of mine, never let you get control of mine
Unless you control my mind, I gotta keep that mindset
This lil' soul of mine, never let you control mine
Well now you finna stay and work it out, not this time

[Hook]
You the worst, but I'm still wishing you the best
Every morning woke up mad at me, reminding me of my past
Seems as though I'm only good at one thing, making you upset, uh
Treat me like a pest, then wonder why I left
I'm getting tired of all this stressin', unable to rest
Wonderin' what type of bullshit you'll get mad at next
I ain't even wanna do it, but I had to, shit I was glad to
You was shooting at me with your words, so I stabbed you
