[Chorus]
She want a title
I'm in denial
Don't need a rifle
Everyone suicidal
Imma burn a bridge
I feel like a pyro
Imma say my prayers
I'll be hellbound tomorrow
I'm in my sorrow
Oxy-my-codone
Does someone have a heart
That I can borrow
Tear me apart
Does someone have a heart
That I can borrow, borrow, oh

[Verse]
Time after time they let me drown in my sorrow
I went through the night, I only wish for tomorrow
Love, love, love, got me walking in circles
Something isn't right
I'm living a lie
Ain't no you and I
Walking in circles
Something isn't right

[Chorus]
And I'm in denial
I don't need a rifle
Everyone suicidal
Imma burn a bridge
Feel like a pyro
Imma say my prayers
I'll be hellbound tomorrow
I'm in my sorrow
Oxy-my-codone
Does someone have a heart
That I can borrow
Tear me apart
Does someone have a heart
That I can borrow, borrow, borrow

[Outro]
It's crazy how I feel, right
I wonder if this real life
Will I see tomorrow, tomorrow
