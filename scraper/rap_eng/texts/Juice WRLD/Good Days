[Chorus]
I miss ridin' round town with my friends
.40 in the stash box, we ain't come to start nun
Cooler then the boys in the band
Color of my dreadlocks, choker on me, headlock
Good days, good days, reminisce the good days
Close my eyes, I tell myself it's okay
Good days, good days, reminisce the good days
Close my eyes, I tell myself it's okay

[Verse 1]
Now we're all grown up, we all came a long way from the start
We all went the wrong way, once or twice
We can't help that shit, it's life
I miss my old friends, member we was doin' xans
Up in school, the teachers said we will be in jail or dead
Now I make way more money then them
Hit up the plug, spend they rent, I bought a pint, red Hi-Tech
I miss my mom, I miss my friends, I miss my house, I miss my pet
Layla fetch! Mom come to L.A., I'll get you a jet
Got off my ass and I got to a check
Feelin' sorry for the niggas who slept
Yeah, on me and my gang, cause we runnin' shit this year
Fuck a phone, I'm gon' hold those hundreds to my ear

[Chorus]
I miss ridin' round town with my friends
.40 in the stash box, we ain't come to start nun
Cooler then the boys in the band
Color of my dreadlocks, choker on me, headlock
Good days, good days, reminisce the good days
Close my eyes, I tell myself it's okay
Good days, good days, reminisce the good days
Close my eyes, I tell myself it's okay
