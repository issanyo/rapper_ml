[Hook/Chorus]
Shoot for love
Like a gun in my hand
We can run up them bands, love
Pop me a Xan, on our way to France, love
Gun in my hand, we can run up them bands, love
Shoot for love
Shoot for love (ohh, ohh, ohh)
Shoot for love

[Verse 1]
She an angel, she with the doves
I be high, I be off the drugs
What would you do for love?
What would you do for love?
Would you shoot for love?

Are you ready or not? Here I come
I done put my heart on the rocks so don't run
I done put my name on a bullet in my gun
I'ma shoot for love
Baby, are you ready or not? Here I come
I done put my heart in this song so don't run
Got my name in a bullet in my gun
I'ma shoot for love

[Bridge]
Run babe, go and hide babe, just don't fall in in love
Run babe, go hide babe, just don't fall for love, in love

Are you ready or not? Here I come
I done put my heart on the rocks so don't run
I done put my name on a bullet in my gun
I'ma shoot for love
Baby, are you ready or not? Here I come
I done put my heart in this song so don't run
Got my name in a bullet in my gun
I'ma shoot for love
Shoot for love

[Hook/Chorus]
Like a gun in my hand
We can run up them bands, love
Pop me a Xan, on our way to France, love
Gun in my hand, we can run up them bands, love
Shoot for love

[Verse 2]
Don't care if you're ready or not, 'cause I'm done
I done had enough of the pain, its not fun
Got my name in a bullet in my gun
I'ma kill for love
Don't care if you're ready or not, 'cause I'm done
I done had enough of the pain, its not fun
Got my name in a bullet in my gun
I'ma kill for love

[Chorus]
Like a gun in my hand, we can run up them bands, love
Pop me a Xan, on our way to France, love
Gun in my hand
We can run up them bands, love
Shoot for love, shoot for love
