[Intro]
Cause they know us

[Chorus x2]
I just told her hold up
I had to get my dough up
Cop a 3 seat then I roll up
Energy tea with the dose up
Keep it low-key when we post up
Cause they know us
Cause they know us, yeah
Cause they know us

[Verse 1]
In the VIP
With a bad lil thing
Heard a nigga he hate on me
Now that I got cake on me
Bad bitch she wait on me, yeah
She gon' fuck for free, yeah
That's a guarantee, yeah
I mean look at me, look at me
I'm so gorgeous
Ball like Jordan
I met her tonight
Fucked her till the morning
Imma take this flight
All the way to London
Imma fuck her right
All the way to London
Making money, I don't make assumptions
Making something and that’s out of nothing
Making money, I don't make assumptions
Making something and that’s out of nothing
She keep comin' when this money comin'
Put it out and now these bitches runnin'
She keep comin' when this money comin'
Put it out and now these bitches runnin'

[Chorus x2]
I just told her hold up
I had to get my dough up
Cop a 3 seat then I roll up
Energy tea with the dose up
Keep it low-key when we post up
Cause they know us
Cause they know us, yeah
Cause they know us

[Verse 2]
Keep it low-key when we post up
Keep 'em posted

So you locked and loaded
Fuck her I don't know her
Living in the moment
Looking at this money, all these millions i own it
I hop in my car, drive it like it stole it
I-I just stole your car, but I drive it like I own it
Boy you know I'm gone, yeah I'm zonin'
They be stealin' flows, nigga I loan it, ay, er
Let me get my shit back now
Oh I got that ? brown whip, like a trap house
Yay, let me get my shit back now
Oh I got that ? brown whip, like a trap house

Don't you hear I'm crying in the back ?
Ay, I can make a nigga back down, huh
Don't you hear the niggas crying

[Chorus x2]
I just told her hold up
I had to get my dough up
Cop a 3 seat then I roll up
Energy tea with the dose up
Keep it low-key when we post up
Cause they know us
Cause they know us, yeah
Cause they know us

[Outro x2]
Dough up
Cop a 3 seat then I roll up
Energy tea with the dose up
We post up
