'Cause a n- got gold
Extraordinary swag, a mouth full of gold, uh
Yeah, uh, yeah, uh, yeah, uh
Off the dome, don’t write it, these other rappers writin'
They prob'ly got writers, my flow so exciting
Like the Buddha, so enlightened, I’m feelin' so entitled
I could swear on yo bitch titties, same as the bible
Pull up with a rifle, on barrel like the Eiffel, huh
Hell yeah I shoot 'em both, I'm indecisive, uh
I'ma fuck ya if I want it 'cause I like it, uh
I'm a Yachty with this shit 'cause I won’t knight her, ay
One night her, lean up in the apple cider
Run up on me, I’ma kill 'em, bullets poison like a viper
Boy I’m fly off the drugs, feel like I got superpowers
Ay yo bitch wet as fuck, get the fuck up out that shower, uh
Off a perc he fuck for a hour, uh
Fuck for another, now after thirty the hour's up
Thirty on me too, hell yeah it'll bust
Sicken niggas, what I nickname my gun? Robitussin
I ain't with the firin’ shit, I ain't with the tusslin'
Ted Cruz when I'm flexin', I don't move a muscle
Niggas talkin' stupid 'til I pull up with the duffle
You don't want no trouble, droppin' bombs like truffles
That's a shroom head
I'm off shrooms goddammit, I'm a shroom head
It is dirt in my closet, get the broom, yeah
And that bitch suckin', yeah, she all on my head
Oh my goodness, my flow god
I need a goddess, oh my god
Run up on me, cool, that chopper on me like a extra arm
I'm super armed, that forty stick on me like a lucky charm
These niggas talkin' stupid, boy they need God
I'm just being honest like Future, wait 'til I make
My own beats, I'm a be a rockstar and then producer
Niggas fake as fuck like some optical illusions
Pull up on 'em like Nike, check 'em, yeah I just do it
Pull up, hell yeah, have 'em leakin' body fluids
Juice WRLD, 999 bitch, it's a movement
Ain't nothin' to it but to do it, I'ma do it
Pull up on the scene, I'ma prove it, I'ma prove it
Takin' Ws all day and he losin'
And that's your main thing? Goddammit, she choosin'
I don't want to fuck her, I just want the neck, no disrespect
Pull up on 'em, chopper like a referee, get a tech
All my niggas ballin' super hard but we don't need no ref
Boy I feel like Breaking Bad, I go broke sellin' crystal meth
Uh, I intercept, take the pass, uh
Puff, puff, pass when I'm smokin' grass, uh
Disrespect the gang, then we on ya ass
We gon' leave a pussy leakin', Maxipad
Harder than a nigga tryin' to catch taxi cab
Call of Duty with the gun, that's delag, uh ay
Aftermath, beat his ass after class, add the money
That's the aftermath from the aftermath
Not the original math, nah, that's the math after that
Niggas want to freestyle? I could do it, battle rap
Feel like Shaquille O'Neal up in the fourth, I rim rattle that
Yo nigga a snitch, he a pussy, he a tattle cat
I don't got no time for this shit, uh, throw a penny on
Got no dimes for this shit, uh, off the dome
I'ma lose my mind off this shit, uh, Stevie Wonder
