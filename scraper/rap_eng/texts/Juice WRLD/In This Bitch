[Intro]
Mega, you played that boy

[Chorus: Juice WRLD & Lil Bibby]
I-I-I been boolin' with my team in this bitch
Mix the 'Xanny with the lean in this bitch
Things ain't really what they seem in this bitch
Got a choppa with the beams in this bitch
I been boolin' with my team in this bitch
Mix the 'Xanny with the lean in this bitch
Things ain't really what they seem in this bitch (ayy, look, say it)

[Verse 1: Juice WRLD & Lil Bibby]
I remember I was down on my dick
Got Versace on my nuts, tell that bitch check my drip
Now lil' shawty kill 'em dead, but I really like her lips
Fuck her dead, I'ma fuck her face an' put her in a Lyft
Sorry, I ain't sorry, that's just how it is
Drove her crazy, now she seein' a psychiatrist
I been ballin' so damn hard, I need a scholarship
Runnin' out of drugs, I need to see a pharmacist
Took too many drugs, I think my plug love me
Pretty nigga even though they too ugly
Feel like Midas, I get golden, don't touch me
I be on the track, yeah, you know it's still bussin'

[Chorus: Juice WRLD]
Got a choppa with the beams in this bitch
I been ballin' with my team in this bitch
Mix the 'Xanny with the lean in this bitch
Things ain't really what they seem in this bitch
Got a choppa with the beams in this bitch
I been boolin' with my team in this bitch
Mix the 'Xanny with the lean in this bitch
Things ain't really what they seem in this bitch

[Verse 2: Juice WRLD & Lil Bibby]
Keep a couple bank rolls, they stay with me
That bitch not from here, she speakin' Japanese
And her friend not from here, she from Italy
Kick 'em out the crib, bitch, this is not Airbnb
I'm the one who hit that mini-man so I brought my semi in
Got your bitch off Remy, Hen, and I'm with Juice, he hit her friend
Yeah I'ma hit her, then I'm gonna fuck her sister
Run up on me, get hit up
Choppa put you on the ground, can't get picked up
They find you out back of the woods if you think it's Swisha
My squad like a pack of wolves, he want beef get bit up
Choppa face the frame if he can't get the picture
She gon' give me brain 'cause she know I'm that nigga

[Chorus: Juice WRLD]
Got a choppa with the beams in this bitch
I been boolin' with my team in this bitch
Mix the 'Xanny with the lean in this bitch
Things ain't really what they seem in this bitch
Got a choppa with the beams in this bitch
I been boolin' with my team in this bitch
Mix the 'Xanny with the lean in this bitch
Things ain't really what they seem in this bitch
