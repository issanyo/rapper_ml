[Chorus]
Yesterday my mom found out I was a junkie
But she don't care, cause I'm over here gettin' all this money
So I don't care if she don't care, just keep them perkies coming
You unaware I got it on me, run up .40 drumming
Where you at, ayy
Run it back, bae
Get the sack, chase
This a drag, race
Where you at, ayy
Run it back, bae
Get the sack, chase
This a drag, race
Yesterday my mom found out I was a junkie
But she don't care, cause I'm over here gettin' all this money
So I don't care if she don't care, just keep them perkies coming
You unaware I got it on me, run up .40 drumming

[Verse]
Listen up, hey
I was in the cut with the semi tucked
High as a bitch, I really feel like throwing up
Perkies more lean, we be pourin' up
10k for a show, or I ain't showin' up
I know life's a bitch, I'm really startin' to like her
Ain't tryin' to argue, I'm a lover, not a fighter
I keep it on me, I'm a shooter, not a fighter
I date the devil, she gon' set my heart on fire

[Chorus]
Yesterday my mom found out I was a junkie
But she don't care, cause I'm over here gettin' all this money
So I don't care if she don't care, just keep them perkies coming
You unaware I got it on me, run up .40 drumming
Yesterday my mom found out I was a junkie
But she don't care, cause I'm over here gettin' all this money
So I don't care if she don't care, just keep them perkies coming
You unaware I got it on me, run up .40 drumming

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
Yesterday my mom found out I was a junkie
But she don't care, cause I'm over here gettin' all this money
So I don't care if she don't care, just keep them perkies coming
You unaware I got it on me, run up .40 drumming
Yesterday my mom found out I was a junkie
But she don't care, cause I'm over here gettin' all this money
So I don't care if she don't care, just keep them perkies coming
You unaware I got it on me, run up .40 drumming
