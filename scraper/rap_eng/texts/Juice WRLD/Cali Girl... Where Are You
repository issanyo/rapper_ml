[Intro]
Let's go to Cali

[Chorus]
Let's runaway to Cali
You can be my Cali girl (you can be my Cali girl)
You can be my Cali girl
Cali, you can be my Cali girl
Hollywood signs and fun times in Cali world
Cali, you can be my girl (you can be my Cali girl)
You can be my Cali girl
Cali, you can be my Cali girl
Hollywood signs and fun times in Cali world

[Verse]
Hollywood signs and fun times, it's alright
You're so fine, you define a good time
Youâ€™re one of a kind, you're all mines, we're aright
When the sun hits your eyes I become blind
You give me adrenaline, got me fallin' in love
Look at all the scenery, palm trees and mountains
There's a way you got me feelin', I'm thinking that it's the drugs
I lost my heart, I met you and found it
I love our surroundings
The hills and the houses
The smells and the good vibes
You bring them around me
Damn, pretty lady
Let's move to the valley
Driving me crazy

[Chorus]
Let's runaway to Cali
You can be my Cali girl (you can be my Cali girl)
You can be my Cali girl
Cali, you can be my Cali girl
Hollywood signs and fun times in Cali world
Cali, you can be my girl (you can be my Cali girl)
You can be my Cali girl
Cali, you can be my Cali girl
Hollywood signs and fun times in Cali world

[Outro]
Hollywood fever
I think I need her
She is a keeper
She drives me crazy
My Hollywood fever
I think I need her
She is a keeper
She drives me crazy
My Hollywood fever
