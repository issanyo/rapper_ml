[Chorus]
I don't talk shit, I let the stick talk shit
Shots to the chest, got em' crip walk-ing
I been getting high off the skywalk shit
Then I mix it up with the moonrock shit
Stick talk let the stick talk shit
Shots to the chest, make him crip walk shit
I been getting high off the skywalk shit
Then I mix it up with the moonrock shit

[Verse 1]
Mix it up with a little bit of that and a little bit of this
I told you baby I'm too high to take a pic
I understand you wanna vibe a little bit
But understand that I'm too high to give a shit
She told me I don't tell the truth I'm full of lies
I told her it's the ugly truth, don't be surprised
I told her I would only tell her one time
Now shut the fuck up and have a good time
When she walks in the room, you see Margiela on her shoes
But she's as shallow as a pool, so I don't know what to do at all

[Chorus]
I don't talk shit, I let the stick talk shit
Shots to the chest, got em' crip walk-ing
I been getting high off the skywalk shit
Then I mix it up with the moonrock shit
Stick talk let the stick talk shit
Shots to the chest make him crip walk shit
I been getting high off the skywalk shit
Then I mix it up with the moonrock shit

[Verse 2]
When I walk in the room, I'll be walking to my doom
So I'll have my hand on a tool
I know they want me to lose, and fall
Bitches come in twos, so I'll admit I fucked a few
But just a few will never do
If I fuck one I guess, I gotta smash em' all
Don't get it confused, I'm nothing like these other dudes
I treat hoes like Pikachus, I guess I gotta catch them all
I do what I wanna do, I know you're not amused
And I'm always on the move, I can teach you how to move
Got her wet like a kiddie pool, yeah she's a splasher
They know that I'm too ahead and they can't catch up
When I walk in the room, I'll be walking to my doom
But I got my hand on my tool
They won't catch me slipping at all

[Chorus]
I don't talk shit, I let the stick talk shit
Shots to the chest, got em' crip walk-ing
I been getting high off the Skywalk shit
Then I mix it up with the moonrock shit
Stick talk let the stick talk shit
Shots to the chest make him crip walk shit
I been getting high off the Skywalk shit
Then I mix it up with the moonrock shit
