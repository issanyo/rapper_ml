[Verse: 1]
She told me she in love with me, and that's lovely
She kinda bad, but her attitude ugly to, me
I'm fuckin' that bitch then I leave
And she can't believe (yeah)
Houdini it's me
Abracadabra, put the pussy on the platter
I thought the bitch was security, the way she give me pat downs
All I ever do is rap now, yeah I had to put the packs down
It's me, rockstar out the trap house

[Verse: 2]
She wanna get in my ride, it ain't for me to decide
Babe if the feelin' is right, you can do whatever you like
That's on me, as long as we keepin it lowkey
And we dodgin the police, cause they think that they know me
When they don't even know me
No, no, no
I ain't goin outside
I'm winnin' and makin' them mad
I know some bitches that do anything for the cash
Last night was so fun, yeah I had a blast
Damn they gotta run it back
I remember doin' xan bars in class, I ain't wanna do the math
I'm with niggas that be takin' other niggas cash
Put the money in the bag
Hit his bitch from the back, she ain't know how to act
Kick her out after that
Then run up a check in my dew rag
All these niggas be stealin' the Juice swag
They lookin' like how did he do that, got a gun in my hand I'ma shoot that
All these niggas got something to prove, but I know they ain't finna prove that
He tellin me what he gon' do, but I know he ain't finna do that
And we ain't got nothing to lose, my niggas pull up and they shoot
It ain't my fault I got more money then you though
I told her handle my dirty work, baby go make yourself useful
I be livin' in the fast lane, shit you ain't used to
Hey, I ain't lookin for a main thing, I'm tryna use you
