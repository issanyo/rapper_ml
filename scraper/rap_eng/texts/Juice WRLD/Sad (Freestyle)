Uh-uh, yeah
Uh

Uh, this one for the legend, uh
I feel like a king, and these other niggas peasants, uh
We should take another nigga loss as a lesson, uh
Hopefully I'm finna meet these niggas up in heaven, uh
I feel like I'm lost in my mind sometimes, uh
I feel like I'm dropped like a dime sometimes, uh
I'm just trying to find out what's mine sometimes, uh
I'm just trying to find out what's mine sometimes, uh, ayy
I get lost in the sauce way too often
Uh, bought my soul back like I fuckin' sold it
Uh, aye, huh, this shit cold, this shit scolding
Yuh, ayy, I wonder what happens when my life over
Sometimes I think it's coming up
I think they runnin' up
So yes, I'ma keep my 40 tucked
I cannot go out, I cannot go out
I will not go out, I gotta show out
I ball too hard on these niggas, it's a blowout
Yeah, it's a blowout

Uh, yeah, ayy
Suicide if you try to take my drugs
Suicide if you try to take my drugs
Suicide if you try to take my drugs
Homicide, baby would you hold my gun?
Suicide if you try to take my drugs
Live a lie, look at all the shit you've done
Uh

Suicide if you try to take my drugs
Homicide, go on and hold my gun
Specify, all the lies you've told
Look at me, what am I on?
Percy, molly, xanny, all that shit in one mix
I'm so high that I cannot remember to forget
Matter of fact, let's just take a sec
Rest in peace to the niggas that left
Rest in peace to the niggas that left
And praise all the niggas that's left
I feel like I'm up in my prime
But who am I gon' share my prime with?
Who am I gon' share my time with?
Sometimes it's just perfect timing
Singing like I'm CeCe Winans
Damn, this shit's unwinding
Yuh, yeah, yeah, ayy

Suicide if you try to take my drugs
Homicide if you try to rob my plug, ayy
Homicide if you try to take my gun
I'ma hit a lick like I smack that tongue, yeah
Suicide if you try to take my drugs
Homicide if you try to rob my plug
Homicide if I'm reaching for my gun
I'm not the one, I'm not the one, ayy

RIP
I'm sad I know yeah
I'm sad I know yeah
