[Chorus x2]
Yeah, the party’s over
But it never ends
She coming over
I do her in
I fuck her over
Say that again
I say it’s over
Say that again

[Bridge]
Imma make this money come in circles
I just mixed the molly with the purple
Party with her friends, party with her friends
Overdose and drive, Imma crash the Benz
First class body, no commercial
Coke bottle body [?]
Party never ends, party never ends
Even at her end, party never ends

[Verse 1]
I put that Gucci in her casket, at her funeral
Broke her heart so bad, yeah she had to go, oh
And you know it’s not my first, yeah
(Breaking hearts is the worst, yeah)
I just let them down and I let them go
Yeah, I had to grab the wheel, had to take control, oh
Cause she know I love to crash
Every heartbreak worse than the last

[Chorus x2]
Yeah, the party’s over
But it never ends
She coming over
I do her in
I fuck her over
Say that again
I say it’s over
Say that again

[Verse 2]
I know that you’re scared Imma hurt you
If I was loving me I would be scared too
You know how it ends, you know how it ends
Breaking all these hearts, yeah it never ends
Time after time Imma leave you
Now you think that I’m evil
Coming to an end, coming to an end
Go and tell your friends, go and tell your friends

[Hook]
I put Versace in her casket, at her funeral
Broke her heart so bad yeah she had to go, oh
And you know that’s like my third, hey
Breaking hearts is a curse, yeah
I just let them down and I let them go, yeah
I let go of the wheel then I lose control, oh
Cause you know I love to crash
Every heartbreak worse than the last

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh
Yeah the party’s over
(I just let them down and I let them go)
It never
I do her
I fuck her over (I fuck her over)
Say that again
I say it’s over
(Every heartbreak's worse than the last)
Say that again

[Chorus]
Yeah, the party’s over
But it never ends
She coming over
I do her in
I fuck her over
Say that again
I say it’s over
Say that again
