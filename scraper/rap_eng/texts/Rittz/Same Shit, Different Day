[Verse 1]
Cell phone keep ringin' off the hook
Cause my homeboy tellin' to call him back
I knew that something was wrong
I could tell that he was outa breathe on the phone
And pissed off sayin' "Dawg it's on" said he was all alone
N' said go offa O' Noir cross the street and he started pumpin gas
Some punks we had beef with then a pass
Rolled up and they jumped his ass
His face busted bad i hung up and called the crew up
Said i knew were these dudes live and we gotta do somethin'
Motherfuckas tryna prove somethin tryna have a dude jumped
Four cars deep when we pulled up
They was outside ready to start ringin'
And swingin' brass knuckles and aluminum bats
It'll do any task, just wait a minute
Up in the hospital, we cut a life pour it in a bag

[Hook]
Same shit different day, Same shit different day
Same shit different day, Same shit different day
Same shit different day, on the Northside of the A
Same shit different day, Same shit different day
Same shit different day, Somebody got robbed
Somebody got sprayed, somebody got paid
Said wuddup homie wudduya say
Same shit different day

[Verse 2]
Homeboy and his girl wanna grab a drink
No nightclub
They just went and hit the local bar
They been dating for a month
They were just in a long-term relationship
But broke it off
