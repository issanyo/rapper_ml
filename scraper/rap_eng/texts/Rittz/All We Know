[Verse 1: Rittz]
It's a problem when you
Can't afford to eat shit but a double cheese from the dollar menu
Gotta pay in quarters
Bitch behind the window pissed she sick of taking orders
Shit aren't we all
Ridin round on E waitin for the car to stall
With a engine cut chick lookin in the mirror puttin on lipstick wishin that she lookin like a barbie doll
Infatuated with all the stars in hollywood wanna wear what the rappers wore
Buy shoes that you can't afford
With no gas in your car to go to the package store to get a pint of martins
Wishin you could drink ciroc I had a brand new watch that didn't turn your wrist green its not cool to shop at K-Mart
The Girls all think you twat
You start hustlin n bumpin
You was movin and end up getting pop'ed
And now you locked up
Pacin and Facin time
Every time you call home your lady cryin
Talk about her period late and I'm pregnant no you ain't what you think I'm blind
The doc say It's a boy we gon name him Brian
He said first we gon make sure the baby mine
I know you out there fuckin bitch thinks I'm blind


[Hook: Jihad]
Sometimes it feels like there ain't no hope
When all you see is darkness it's hard to blow
Holdin' to the scars so the pain don't show
Holdin' to the past 'cuz we can't let go
Don't blame us 'cuz it's all we know
This is all we know (X2)


[Verse 2: Rittz]
Luxuries
Got a couple bucks in my pocket next to my cutlass keys
Don't gotta tuck my piece
Gotta couple soldiers with me attention at ease
With no associate degrees but still better than a drug disease
We confused and lost
Poppin. Loritab, Roxy, Oxy contin
...goin through withdrawals...no mood...
Called my homeboy trynna shoot the shit. "Hello"
Dude its Rittz what the hell been up?
He said that he fell in love with some stupid bitch in one month she was movin in
Everything goin good then his boo done went and left him for a minute, had loot to spend
Now he said he feels stupid, said he gonna shoot her, see the tool homie gonna do em in
All I could say was keep your head up
He said what is that? Never mind dog It was good to catch up
Feelin that though he never really had love
We all done bad shit doesn't add up
Laying with a bad bitch on a mattress
So the dude like me can't get a back rub
These days we pray please holla back god
But I guess you gotta take the good with the bad so

[Hook: Jihad]

[Verse 3: Rittz]
All she wanted was to have some kids
And a husband, love and happiness
Sayin' where does a life like that exist?
No family, she ain't seen daddy since she came out the womb with a bunch of bastard kids who got dissed with the disadvantages
So the optimism vanishes
Made a wish when she lit the candle stick
Like God hear me out
I appreciate you
I don't wanna seem like I'm being ungrateful
I'm lucky that I'm livin I ain't been no angel
But ever since grade school shit has been painful
I don't owe a person a explanation
How am I to live up to your expectations
I'm addicted to meth to say that I'm depressed is an understatement
Estimation. Need some medication or at least some love
My boyfriends cheatin, he beats me up
Gotta best friend but shes strung out too
When I talk to her she says join the club
And I dont wanna die but I'm losin my will to live
Please God forgive
In the name of Jesus I pray Amen
She hit the chittle again cause that's all she know
