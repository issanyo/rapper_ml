[Verse 1: Rittz]
She was irate cause she got off work late for the second time this week
Racing home in a white Ford Escape
Had a nice quiet place by the lake up in Washington state
Her fiancee was paid but he had to take a trip out to Vegas and they ain't got no family
Or neighbors close by so she called him on the phone and let him know that she had made it home safe
Might have spoke too soon, as soon as she went inside her bedroom a man with a mask lashed out from inside of the closet
Put a knife up to her neck and said "Be quiet, try to scream and you'll be dead"
Ignoring what he said she screamed, it seemed to piss him off he shoved one of his gloves into her mouth
Tied her hands behind her back then he stabbed her in the abdomen and threw her on the bed
For 3 hours straight he tortured and raped her she tried to pray and fake like she was dead
She bled so much she knew that she was dying, closed her eyes
And when she opened them she noticed he was gone
Somehow she managed to make her wrists slide out of zip-ties
Used all of her strength crawling on the floor to lock the bedroom door
She made it to the nightstand and grabbed the phone and called 9-1-1

[Verse 2]
He was a single parent that had retired, him and his teen daughter live together
He never had problems with her as a kid
But she been misbehaving lately, that's a part of growing up
She was so in love with her new boyfriend - he was older
Her father told her he didn't want her seeing him
Cause she and him were skipping school just to sleep with him
And he could tell that they'd been doing drugs
Her father took her cell phone and car keys from her as punishment
Even threatened to send her to live with her momma
200 miles away but that would only make her hate him
Started plotting on her dad
One night when he sleeping he figured that he was dreaming cause he opened up his eyes
Saw his daughter staring at him from the bottom of his bed
And her boyfriend was standing right above him with a bat
Before he could react, or try to defend himself against her boyfriend, all you heard was whack
He hit him repeatedly, his daughter acted
Emotionless watching his blood splatter on the wall
Beat him to a bloody pulp for at least thirty minutes
There were fragments of his skull on the bed
Then her boyfriend left
Cracked the window, grabbed the telephone
She tried to play it off and called 9-1-1

"Calm down, calm down"
"daddy...daddy... are you ok?
"We'll send somebody out there right now."
"Daddy are you ok? Breathe, dad."
