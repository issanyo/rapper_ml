[Verse 1: Tech N9ne]
I'm just tryin' to get it the way I know it - by doin' music and so it's - been goin' really good I flow up - because (a groesh Nina?) got the money to show it -
But when other people hurt your people they make you blow up
'Cause they shit basic now you workin' the day shift
That makes this paste as low as a sunken cake, get
Laced with hatred, he goin' home and your loved one gotta face him
Women in this predicament ain't the safest
Full of the trees, Hennessy, he's trippin'
What you believe is intimacy, whippin'
All on his lady he callin' the baby to witness
He gotta be crazy and he ought to be eighty-sixed
This ain't when you mind your business, in this
Flippin' his noodle back like a gymnast, grimace
Off my square and almost pulled the trigger
Gentleman, I say if you ever hit my sister, nigga I'll kill you

[Hook: Wrekonize]
See the lines were crossed 'cause you no longer took care
Look there, look there you just caught me off my square
You don't wanna end up feelin' lifeless in despair
Look there, look here you just forced me off my square
I don't ever wanna see your face again, beware
Look here, look there you just pulled me off my square
Ain't nobody gonna escape, no you will not be spared
Look here, look here you just forced me off my square

[Verse 2: Bernz]
Writin' another postcard from the edge
Instead of pointing the barrel of a gun at my head
Just buried another friend on the eve of the end
2016, and daddy still in the feds
Thank God for my seed and weed from my head
'Cause lately they been tryin' to break me in pieces again
My momma told me that baby don't be weak with the pen
'Cause somethin'  has gotta give and you don't dream when you're dead
I used to think that life was predetermined
Used to kneel and just believe the sermons
But now I know you 'lone until it's curtains
And still, I spill my will until it's burnin'
I'm killin' 'em all, I'm willin' to fall from grace
Whole shit a facade, I was livin' where Y'all fake
Guess it is what it ain't until I reincarnate
When I wreck and rotate and you're gone from the face of the Earth

[Hook: Wrekonize]
See the lines were crossed 'cause you no longer took care
Look there, look there you just caught me off my square
You don't wanna end up feelin' lifeless in despair
Look there, look here you just forced me off my square
I don't ever wanna see your face again, beware
Look there, look here you just pulled me off my square
Ain't nobody gonna escape, no you will not be spared
Look here, look here you just forced me off my square

{Verse 3: Wrekonize}
Ha, check it out
Travelin' souls, we out on the road and [?]
Day after whole we feedin' our souls with juice 'cause
Tourin' can take a toll and brake your soul if you ain't really payin' attention to what you're used to
I heard word it was a Twiztid show
At the Palladium down the street, let's go
A couple of fans offered a couple of hands
It's something I really thought must've didn't go slow
Took it out, I split it with a friend with mine
Waitin' for the feeling I have felt like several times
But it never came, it felt like something else was prime
What the hell is this, that you would call an X, you lyin'
Strapped in, holdin' on tight by the journey
I think this might've been just tryin' to disturb me
Off my square and I rectangle to scurvy
Bring up a life was really tight quite no nerve

[Verse 4: Rittz]
Oh shit shit, what are the odds?
I was watching the same show
Then I recognize Wrekonize
Started screaming Hey Yo!
I ain't seen him in a minute
We was kickin' it
He told me what had happened
Ironically we was on the same boat
Sorta kinda
I was drunk and I wanna snort a line o'
Some dude I ain't know said he know someone who got it
I was wishin' that he woulda took my hundred dollars
But instead, this muthafucka probably got some fake coke
I ain't know it 'til I tried, shoulda said no
But I got myself excited
He was gone, couldn't find him
Started walkin' through the concert
It was obvious I lost it
I was talkin shit, confrontin' anybody lookin' like him
That was when I seen Wreck
Really it was perfect timin'
He had to calm me down then we started drinking jack
When I finally seemed relaxed
