[Verse 1]
A-town bound drinkin' straight Crown
Everyday we celebrating like we seen the peace drop
Drink a bottle of liquor then we restock
Got the free blow for the hoes and the geek squad
Be my guest, you can say that I'm blessed
I don't get a lot of rest but I get to do my dream job
D-dot shades on, my Levi's, J's, black T-shirt with a CNT sign
CTS-V series, the interior's soft
Showing off spread my feathers like a peacock
I'ma keep grinding til the day I finally got a diamond
On my finger bigger than a ring pop
Finally hit the sweet spot, you can hear the beat knock
Rumble in the sheet rock, why you try'na eavesdrop
In the hotel with the Molly Ringwald
In the field like I took a pill in Ibiza, ya-ya-uh-yeah
Life is a like a see-saw, feeling like I'm stuck in the air
Everyday I'm discovering something I wasn't aware
I been winning for the last five years
I ain't like them when I rap, I'm rare
Like a flash in the night in the sky
They swear they saw a

[Hook]
Shootin' star
I've been known to go stupid hard
Shootin' star
Fly and showing my jewelry off
Shootin' star
Speakers boom when I'm zoomin' off
Shootin' star
My kind is kind of unusual
I've been known to go stupid hard
Fly and showing my jewelry off
Speakers boom when I'm zoomin' off
People see me and swear they saw a
Shootin' star
Shootin' star
My kind is kind of unusual

[Verse 2]
Smokin' on a Cuban Cigar
Feelin' like King Crook with my homeboy Doug
Kickin' it with Detroit Don up in Heart Rose in the neighborhood where the cop won't come
If you wanna get an Uber
Fuck her till the crowd showed up
I can hear 'em cheering Rittz and my heart got pumped
Time for me to give it to 'em raw and uncut
Bout to see a shooting star close up
Play the hi-hat
Everybody in the crowd relate to me and they be singing A to Z
'Cause they can see that we are not afraid to keep our head up
When they said that we was bade to be the underpaid and
Can't achieve our fantasy, that's damaging our confidence
Never had a scholarship or went to college but the ones who did
I bet they kinda wishin' they done had a major that had got 'em in a dominant position
But instead they went and got a job but OfficeMax, damn
Don't be mad, it's a job and it's finally Friday, it's five pm
Hit the bank, you could save it or spend what you made, hit the ATM
Life might not quite go the way we planned
We about to sleep in, we been up all night getting high
We been looking in the sky like man, I seen a

[Hook]
Shootin' star
I've been known to go stupid hard
Shootin' star
Fly and showing my jewelry off
Shootin' star
Speakers boom when I'm zoomin' off
Shootin' star
My kind is kind of unusual
I've been known to go stupid hard
Fly and showing my jewelry off
Speakers boom when I'm zoomin' off
People see me they swore they saw a
Shootin' star
Shootin' star
My kind is kind of unusual

[Outro]
Speakers in my trunk boomin' hard
Hear my speakers in my trunk boomin' hard
Speakers in my trunk boomin' hard
My kind is kind of unusual
