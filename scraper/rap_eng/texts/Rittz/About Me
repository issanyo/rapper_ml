[Hook: Jelly Roll]
And I don't give a fuck
What you say about me
I don't care what you say about me
And I don't give a fuck
What you say about me
I don't care what you say about me
And I don't give a fuck

[Verse 1: Jelly Roll]
It's still [?] zone
And I keep them gangsters round me
They talking shit but really
They don't know a thing about me
Cops asking questions then I pull my disappearing act
'Fore this rap I sold it cheap
Like it was on a clearance rack
And I'm still the same dawg
Ain't shit changed dawg
I can rap with eyes closed while juggling chainsaws
It's easy, man it's nothing to a G
When it comes to me
Now ain't nothing for the free

[Hook]

[Bridge: Jelly Roll]
What you drink, don't make me piss
And what you eat, don't make me shit
Now
And I don't give a fuck
What you say about me
I don't care what you say about me
I'mma be me

[Verse 2: Jelly Roll]
It's Fat Man Jones
Incase you fuckers forgot
Look at a super bad bitch
Like are we fucking or not?
Now whenever she need it
I know who she gonna call first
Cause I fuck her good
And eat that pussy till my jaws hurt
Now I'm off in Hollywood
And they like 'there that man again'
And I'm country as a sumbitch
How's your mommi now?
Hit a lick for half a brick
And plus a thousands good pills
Got it free and sold it cheap
I feel like the Goodwill
Man I fuck with Tech N9ne
I swear I'm so Strange with it
Insane in the brain with it
I go David Blaine with it
Tell my publicist to call that I need a kitchen
Cause I'm fat and I'm funny and I'm famous

[Verse 3: Rittz]
I'mma log onto Youtube now, read the comments
I don't give a fuck about, what a hater gotta say
But every now and then
I let them get under my skin and cuss 'em out
Well here's one, someone said my songs are boring
I'm fat and I have an annoying voice
But all the bitches say my voice is smooth
And I'm fly flamboyant like I'm georgous George
And you ain't gotta listen to my shit
The choice is yours, well here's another one
Here's someone who done said I was a wannabe
What you mean? wanna be what? wanna be rich? hell yeah
I don't wanna be struck, being broke man
The shit will make you wanna eat rust
Slumerican apparently you wanna be us
But I bet you really wanna eat one of these nuts
Now you someone that I see and wanna beat up
Having trouble, keep it
I got a good laugh when I got on Facebook
And said I'm finally rich
Somebody else said I look like Suzie top
But this is hair, not a beard, what you roger bitches?
Thinking I do meth, I'm a coke head, oh well
People gonna make accusations
And I don't snort coke everyday, but I do on special occasions
