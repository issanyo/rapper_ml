[Intro]
Dear Lord
Please forgive me
I'm so ashamed of everything that I've done
I'm trying to be a better person, God
I need your help

[Verse 1]
Who the fuck gon' pick me up when I fall?
Waiting on my Xanax to dissolve
Eat a bar just to go on stage
Just a bottle was a problem that I just can’t solve
On the “Slumerican Made Tour” last Fall
Everything snowballed, lookin' back and I’m appalled
Hit an all time low, had a two month binge
On that Blow, and I know you heard that song
But this real life
Ever wake up from a drunk night like you pissed people off?
That was me the whole tour
When I got home, I was so embarrassed
Had me feelin' like I need to call - Wolf
And say “Sorry” for bein' so obnoxious
And constantly actin' like a junky, a Jay
On his bus doin' bumps, in my bunk
In the dark, from my heart, and the A

[Hook]
God bless my soul
Demons following me everywhere I go
That temptation in my face I can't control
Trying to chase them down this straight and narrow road
Here I go
Just say no!

[Verse 2]
But I can’t, goin' up to fans
About to damn near beg for drugs
Tellin' them I can get 'em into backstage
If they get me some, my self-respect was gone
I stayed up all night with Ounce and Big Henry
Then go and get a room about 2 P.M
Eating Xanax in the afternoon
Cause I’m panicking from the Coke
My heart, don’t know what mood it’s in
I FaceTime with my girl in my room
And when I finally fall asleep I make her watch
It’s a daily routine, I tell her I can’t breathe
And to keep an eye on me, just in case I stop
Look at my face in shock
My nose was so inflamed and swollen
So much abuse to it that it got infected
It’s five times it’s normal size
Plus, I blew my knee out
Drunk, tryin' to slap box a wrestler
Up at Whistler center, about to hit the E.R
It’s hard to explain yourself
Why your nose is the size of Gonzo's
The doc knows you’re a cocaine addict
You can only blame yourself
Here I am in the hospital bed
But instead of regret, I’m thinking about the cocaine I left
On the bus, I officially flushed
I told my girl I'm okay, I’ll be home in two days to rest
I got home, but really all the damage was done
Couldn’t go out into public without being nervous
And my dick didn’t work for like a month
Couldn’t bend my knee up in physical therapy
But as far as Coke and the urge, I was done
Didn’t learn shit, cause I did the same thing on the next tour run

[Hook]
God bless my soul
Demons following me everywhere I go
That temptation in my face I can't control
Trying to chase them down this straight and narrow road
Here I go
Just say no!

[Outro]
No!
No!
NO!
Yeah..
Fuck it, give me some
I'll do a little bit
Yeah..
Fuck...
