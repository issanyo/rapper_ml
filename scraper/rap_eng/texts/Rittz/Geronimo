[Hook]
I been drinking till the bottle's gone
And I'm all alone
So high don't what cloud I'm on
Look out below Geronimo
I'm bout to jump out the window
The time has come
And I gotta go
I told the Lord I'm coming home
Look out below Geronimo
I'm bout to jump out the window

[Verse 1]
See Jonny says that life is overrated
He says that every day is so monotonous he hate it
He's had a 9 to 5 since '99 and he don't make shit
He lying on his applications saying he graduated
And he blame it on his parents back in the day they separated
Did music in the basement daily he was dedicated
Sedated on you name it but it made him feel creative
He's embarrassed now he feels like he might have wasted
All his time he'll never make it
Growing up he always had a lot of friends
But some just did him dirty others doing as bad as him
Feeling grimm they getting old and can't relive the past again
Wishing that he had some cash to spend
But the only cash he has he has to ration it
His girlfriend is everything she love him
But all they ever do is get drunk on alcohol and
Talk about how they got nothing
I heard him from a couple floors above me
He screaming that he's jumping drunk and singing to his woman

Look out below Geronimo

[Verse 2]
See Tanya and her mom don't get along
What makes it even harder Tanya father's always gone
He's never home it's like he's hiding from his family at his job
Instead of coming home right after work
He's spending his time up at the bar
That's why his daughters lost and craving some attention
Feening for it screaming for it won't nobody listen
Started having sex and found a way to get affection
Everyone she slept with says they hit and they didn't use protection
And left when she started to get attached
And all she wants is love it's like her heart is up for grabs
The doctor says she's pregnant but she don't know who's the dad
And he parents kicked her out because they racist
And the baby daddy's black
So now she's shacking up in one of her friends apartments
Drinking while she's pregnant talking about
How cold her heart is from hardships
She look up at the sky sighing why am I alive
I should dive off this balcony she cried

Look out below Geronimo
I'm bout to jump out the window
The time has come
And I gotta go
I told the Lord I'm coming home
Look out below Geronimo
I'm bout to jump out the window window window

[Outro]
