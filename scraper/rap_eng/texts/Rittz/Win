[Intro]
Yeah
You know what I'm talkin' about
It's a trip when you're goin' down
And you got all 'em suckers around
You know what I'm talkin' about
But what's really fucked up
Is when you get up off your ass
Them same suckers that wanted to see you finish
Now they got to see you winnin'
And they got to see you winnin'
Tabernacle cathedral

[Verse 1: Rittz]
Ain’t shit changed, but the time on the wrist watch
And my shit might rhyme, to design this [?] hoodie, they send another gift box
Not the type of rapper you gon’ find inside a thrift shop
Running to the money like a pitboss (whoa!)
Taking trips cross-country, My inbox full of titty pics, make a pit stop
You can see the lip prints on my dick from your lip gloss
Pimp shit, bitches always looking shy, tell ‘em get lost
My celebrity affectin’ me, somebody must have tipped off people where I live
See them riding by my crib with they phone, poppin’ flix off, getting flicked off
I’ma upgrade soon, 'cause I just made 200,000 every time I check my balance
I’m astounding, counting down my racks, I’m 'bout to lift off
NASA, plasma TV 65 inch, class of 98’, skated out in 96’
Glass of Crown Royal, splash of a lime
Whizz, Massive amounts of gas, used to have to buy mids
Used to have to fry fish, thinking how can I fit all this shit inside this
Dumpster without having to dive in, making $9 an hour
I barely had enough to buy cigs
And I ain’t trying to say that I’m rich, but I ain’t trippin' on no ‘Port package
Livin’ more lavish, New York status
Got the horseradish and the Au Jus  on the side of my prime rib
I’m just proud of what I did
When people see you living better, they [?] lots of Dry Gin
But I ain’t finna let 'em nestle under my skin
Game over, I win in the end 'cause

[Hook: Rittz]
So much time was spent
Trippin' 'cause I never had a dime to spend
Situation made it hard to find my strength
To convince myself in the end one day
I'd finally win
I knew I'd finally win
And I'ma keep winnin' again, and again, and again
'Cause so much time was spent
Broke in the same boat with my friends
But when I blew there were
More then a few that would try to act cool
But I knew they hate to see me win
They hate to see you win
But I'ma keep winnin' again, and again, and again, and

[Verse 2: Hitman Shawty]
Feelin' Tom Brady in the Super Bowl
Ridin' in the ' Vette they gon' stay patrol
Rizz on that brown, don't lose control
All the work gone bring another load
Don't leave the state, out on parole
Safe full of money, kill me for the code
This a celebration , Laco make a toast
Everybody eatin', fuck who ate the most
Going coast to coast, shop at different states
Jet skis on the lake, feds try to build a case
Stab me in back, smile in your face
Laid back, windows tinted
Home run, ninth innin'
'member days with some pennies
They don't wanna see me winnin'

[Hook: Rittz]
So much time was spent
Trippin' 'cause I never had a dime to spend
Situation made it hard to find my strength
To convince myself in the end one day
I'd finally win
I knew I'd finally win
And I'ma keep waitin' again, and again, and again
'Cause so much time was spent
Broke in the same boat with my friends
But when I blew there were
More then a few that would try to act cool
But I knew they hate to see me win
They hate to see you win
But I'ma keep waitin' again, and again, and again, and

[Verse 3: Kane]
I've done it all, seen it all
Slick boy , bitch, I was born to ball
Been kickin' up dust and stirrin' up fuss
Since a young nigga was about two feet tall
Been takin' trips back and fourth out the mall
Fuckin' up checks and servin' hard ball
Smoked the best green and shot at dope fiends
And hung with niggas who got lawyers on call
But now we gotta deal with the new wave
Some fake like Shaq wearin' Toupees
All the Instagram cap get you melee'd
Twelve addin' up shit like fifth grade
Some of the friends we grew up with
Ain't to be fucked with and crab any chance they get
Say that we'd kill for you but steal from you
Too old for that duck shit, quit
Actin' like you solid when you know you ain't
Ho runnin' through your vein like a blood bank
I mean the shit just pitiful, the hatin' gettin' critical
It rub off on a player like wet paint
Tell your partner that you comin' when you know you can't
Tell your homie you gonna help them when you know you ain't
Claimin' that it's all good but the shit fake
I can tell if you're a lame from a handshake
Ground floor, I'm getting money be the mandate
At the spot shit movin' like an earthquake
Fuck around get flipped, bitch, pancake
Do a 8, treat the shit like a mixtape
Say I'm strange but my clientele Norman Bates
Open 24/7 with the best rates
Watch the company you keep
Streets give or take
Ain't a perm on my name and I'm still straight

[Hook: Rittz]
So much time was spent

'Cause so much time was spent
