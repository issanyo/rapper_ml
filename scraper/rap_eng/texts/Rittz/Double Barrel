[Intro]

[Verse One - Yelawolf]
Hello Rittz
Know you over there burning kush
Red hairdo popping out of that black stocking cap like a burning bush
Well let me let mine go
Let my hair down and let a line go
Never mind though like an old wino
Sipping on lime and coke I'm dope I'm Dope
Yeah bitch don't judge my rope
Won't find another like this in the store
No dope come and get you one of these
Money in the bank won't make an emcee
That's true but it's making him believe
Shitting me buddy Yela shaking up the tree
Handing over weeds? like a weeping willow jack
Cause a ratchet ? now fella go to sleep?
I got em peeping over seas
Got a check coming I ain't tripping over cheese
Unless it's a stack the size of a tree trunk
And I'm in an atv
RING RING
I'm throwing mud I'm showing up
I'm blowing drugs I'm so clean I'm blowing suds
You know whats up?
Hey when I get down I get the FUCK down
Double barrel from the side of the truck
Click click bang the fuckers down
10 pointer
See that's three 3 points and one
Bitch get off me
Big pen on the page like a plastic handgun
White trashes bitches and some
Black eyelashes in hand? and boobies too
Ritz crackers in the box
Wanna eat want a treat
Well get on it dude

[Verse Two - Rittz]
Yeah bitch its Rittz and Catfish Billy
Chucking me the light while I crack this philly
You ain't never heard anybody rap this illy
I'm the limelight kid
Higher than a mother fucking skyline is
Dick gag a bitch till her eyeliner start dripping down her cheek like a teardrop
Clear chopped out on a mirror the beer disappeared so we drinking on the Smirnoff
We're not the alcoholics but you can find me on the late night sipping on a whiskey beverage
In the bed with my red head between some legs
I bet I eat her pussy better than Melissa Etheridge
Eat meth for breakfast snort coke for lunch
I think I need to go and see Dr. Drew
Load the gun under the seat of the aqua blue Monte Carlo the cops in hot pursuit
Fuck an obstacle I got pot to move and you can tell when you smell the good dro
Yeah that's me in the club I got a bitch by my side and we getting gone at the Yelawolf show
With the Dixie Mafia the homie transcend bout to put the damn pen to the J-Plymp track
Other rappers that tried either died or they got denied because they came and they ain't been back

[Verse Three - Yelawolf]
Double barrel back in my truck window is impeccable
Elastic on beats my wordplay is stretchable
Popeye on the street with my green Chevy bass up treble low
I grew up with hot sauce on tables for my vegetables
Skateboard on my feet and a backpack full of that work load
I drop off the weight and pinch a gram before I let go
Never fuck with techno
Never popped the purple haze
Stoners caught the elbow
Ravers bought the special k
Flashing lights of red and blue
Paparazzi hide
And you don't have no hand? cause you're a friend of mine
Rittz is synchronous so Yelawolf has to got fly
J-Plymp is whipping tow trucks I had to catch a ride
