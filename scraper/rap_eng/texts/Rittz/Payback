[Verse 1] Demrick
Me no play that shit, not a little bit
Fuck the middleman, we don’t feel the kid
Catch him still in here, watch how real it get
Watch how militant, when it come to stacking paper up
The tracks is bumping, wake the neighbours up
Got guns with lasers, baby come and blaze you like my favourite flavours, twist it in a blunt
Only live once so I’ma make the best of it
Fuck the rest of it
Hard to rest knowing death coming
You keep coming up like upset stomachs
You owe me, I’m coming in head busting
And none of those packs short
You better add a back force
Crash like them backboards
We deep like the task force
You get what you ask for
‘Cause mama got to eat
Sister got to eat, brother got to eat
Dirty money coming in every other week
Rinse and repeat. (Woah.)
We ain’t missing a beat
We can hear when you lie through your teeth. (For real.)
So please say that shit, we don’t play that shit. (Nah.)
You [?] play that shit
My patience is paper-thin. You know I play to win
We don’t play pretend
‘Til the end it’s
(Let’s go!)

[Hook] Demrick
Please don’t play with me
We don’t play that
Please don’t play with me
We don’t play that
Please don’t play with me
We don’t play that
If you play with me, you ‘gon get that pay
