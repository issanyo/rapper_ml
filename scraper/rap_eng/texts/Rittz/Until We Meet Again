[Verse 1]
Another school shooting just occurred today
Thinking what on earth
Could make somebody run up in a school or a church
And take innocent lives away based on a person's race
Little school kids stripped of their vertebrae's
Fake rumors start to circulate
They beat his ass on camera, cause they heard he's gay
The YouTube views almost over 30k
The internet got us so shallow that we impersonate
Celebs' thinking that we all should be one
And not that we failed
The world, they need male role models
Wish you knew your pops but he's gone
And mom don't keep up, she got two jobs
Don't like stress, working for her children
She's at work while her teenage daughter
In the room with a dude and she twerking while he filming
Hurt somebody's feelings
Shit all we do online is diss and talk bad, and we bash
Total strangers
Hope's endangered
Glad to see my homie's made it back from Iraq
But his limbs are torn up, his friends got blown up
Enlisted as a kid, ever since, they grown up
They been through so much, disposed to death in combat
How the fuck you come back and adapt?
My homie just got Hodgkin's Lymphoma
I'm praying every day hoping he gonna beat it
Strong motherfucker on the phone with me
Telling me jokes while he's going through his chemo treatment
And he didn't put one sob story on his timeline
Instagram or Facebook ain't always real life
People staring at their phones so much that they forget to look up and see the skyline
Thinking that they Einstein cause they wrote a clever post
It's  Just a flash in a tiny attention span
Music is chewed up like fast food and spewed out
Like "I'm new with a menu plan"
I can't hear shit..
Sincerety clearly has died
My lyrics are merely mirrors to the tears in my eyes


[Chorus]
I’ve done my best to share my life
My privacy's been sacrificed
But now we've reached the end
Until we meet again
I've put my soul in every word
I've shared my pain until it hurts
But now we've reached the end
Until we meet again
Ah yeah

[Verse 2]
Woke up and I checked Worldstar this morning
A cop just shot and killed a black kid
It was all recorded
Just like the incident they put up two days before it
It's become so normal that it sickens me
I know that I'm probably going to piss some people off listening
Because I'm white and I'm talking about some shit we generally don't go through
But still I can't ignore it
There's so many people with power that won't go forward
The problem ain't gonna solve itself
Half of the cases are unreported until it's caught on someone's cell
And this is not a diss to all law enforcement
We call on them to help out when there is a threat
But I guess it's because I'm white, if I was black I'd be scared to death
When David Banner asked us
"Where were all the white rappers at when Mike Brown got gunned down?"
I couldn't think of any answers
I felt ashamed and afraid of the future
With no contribution or any helping hand to lend
I went to Kansas City
Shooting videos for my last album
And I could feel the tension
Another time of my life that I felt I was guilty for the color of my skin tone
Three months later, I was back in Missouri
On tour the same night that the verdict was read
I was in shock, on Twitter venting
Then one of my fans tweeted that Mike Brown deserved it
I said, "Man, you dumb as fuck
Imagine you went to the store for blunts
And tried to run out the door with a pack
And the cops didn't bother arresting you
Or give you a lecture
But instead they just murdered you dead, man this shit ain't right!"

[Chorus]
I’ve done my best to share my life
My privacy's been sacrificed
But now we've reached the end
Until we meet again
I've put my soul in every word
I've shared my pain until it hurts
But now we've reached the end
Until we meet again
Ah yeah..

[Outro]
We hold these truths to be self-evident
That all men are created equal
They are endowed by their creator
With certain unalienable rights
And among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness
That to secure these rights
Governments are instituted among men
Deriving their powers from the consent of the governed
All men are born free and equal
And have certain natural, essential, and unalienable rights
Among which may be reckoned the right of enjoying and defending their lives and liberties
That of acquiring, possessing, and protecting their property
And find that of seeking and obtaining their safety and happiness
We've taken too many steps forward to take this many back
We've taken too many steps forward to take this many back
