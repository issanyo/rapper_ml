Now rocking with / Rittz on Ballers Eve / bitch follow me
Drunk as hell / still / mixing alcohol and weed

Knocking motherfuckers out / like Rocky
Bet I'll crack ya / like Apollo Creed / with no apology

My eyes / chinky like I'm asian
Ching chong / spitting fire like I'm cajun

And the radio / play me all day long / like a drake song
And I did it without siga-singin' / ay! / like Akon

T-Pain Trae Song / I'm gorilla with it / when I spit it
Homie / I'm about to get my ape on

Dare a mafucka / hate on me / man I'm fresher
Bout to catch ya / wearing dickies / and an apron

Way way / gone / but the flow goin' ham
Dro in the bowl / call it golden gram

Bout to take a ho / from the show
To the hotel room / then I turn into the Trojan Man
