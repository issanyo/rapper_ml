[Hook]
Smoking weed and staying high
Partying till late at night
‘Cause all we do is drink
And all we do is smoke
And all we're doing is wastin’ time

[Verse 1: Rittz]
High school dropout chapter one
On the way to school smoking massive blunts
My mom was at work, my dad was gone
It felt wrong, after first period we run
Inside the woods, back of Berkmar High on 29
Skipping school made the winter feel like summertime
Getting U's in every class but fuck if I don’t pass
I don’t plan to graduate I really wanna rhyme
In my cutlass I’m 16 meek leans
And vogues on that rapper shit
Call my mom at work and told her "fuck high school
I ain’t never going back, I quit"
She cried her eyes out, all I did was laugh and click
Hung up on her
What a dick, looking back at it
That was the last thing she need
She would cry herself to sleep every night
‘Cause my dad just left for shit
Maybe this a reason for rebellion
Maybe it’s the reason I’m inhaling
Stealing, doing gas runs, breaking in the vacuum cleaners
Driving stolen cars like a hellion
Smoke another L then trying to act grown
But we was just children, snorting coke, taking acid
Another shotgun to the nose
10 years in a row
High watching time waste and pass us

[Hook]
Smoking weed and staying high
Partying till late at night
‘Cause all we do is drink
And all we do is smoke
And all we’re doing is wastin’ time
I know I need to change my life
But it’s hard for me to say goodbye
‘Cause all we do is drink
And all we do is smoke
And all we’re doing is wastin’ time

[Verse 2: Rittz]
Kids my age done graduate in college
Some married some have some kids
Most of them have credit cards and cars
Or large houses, me I'm on that rapper shit
Which means I don’t got a job
I just have a couple hundred dollars
And a sack and a pack of cigs
Still smoke with the crew but it ain’t fun like it used to be
We got high, we don't laugh, we bitch about
Shit we don’t got funny enough
Somehow we always got money for drugs
Getting too old to be running for cops
Expired tags drunk driving with a gun in the glove
With no permit turned into a drug addict
Yesterday my dad called and he said that I concerned him
‘Cause I’m pale and i’m frail
When I sitting inside my house with my girlfriend like a hermit
Hurry pull the curtain
Working dead end jobs part time for the extra cash
But it never lasts, and i never had
Any backup plan, broke, running from a driver of a checkered cab
I need to catch a nap but
I’ve been up for 3 days doin meth with my so called better half
‘02 — '05 was a blur, it occurred to me one night, I was in the lab just

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Big K.R.I.T.]
Well I was wastin time while I was pacing around
With that MD20/20
Rap game ain’t paying my pockets ain't banging, my fridgidaire still empty
Ribs are stickin, my mouth is dry, looking for another couch to occupy
Mama like come on baby maybe this ain’t for you
Give another 9 to 5 a try
But I rather sell bootleg movies out of my partner’s hooptie
Bang my music, roll a doobie
Sip some lean, hit the strip
Bang a bitch that probably average
But when she pops a pill she’s a savage
And I was half lit when I smashed it
Woke up at 2 there's an eighth
Think I’m losing my faith, good Lord ain’t have shit
Eviction notice fuck being focused
I’m overdosin on Jim Beam
Black out then I come to
Like what we sipping on, who got the green
‘Cause I need it
One 55 soaking wet, damn I ain’t eating
It’s a blessing I’m still breathing
‘Cause I was”

[Hook]
