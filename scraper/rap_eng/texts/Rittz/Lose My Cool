[Verse 1]
Northside Atlanta ambassador, back for more
The second I see 'em mash record
I’m spazzin' on 'em if they’re askin' for it
The first to put it on the map, so don’t be actin like I passed the torch
Ain’t got the patience for the back and forth
The murder rap has got me on a wanted poster with a cash reward
I’m short tempered, these boys better be glad I’m on
When I was young, I would jack you for your pack of ‘ports
They know me at the local package store, they give me discounts
Thirty minutes out from Midtown, where we sip Crown Royal
Someone swole, they get drunk and run they big mouth
Then somebody punch 'em, they unconscious for the ten count
This rap game is similar to being back in school again 'cause
All my crew is in the building and the in-crowd
It’s cool to be lame nowadays, so excuse me if my attitude is
Who the fuck are you to say what’s in style?
Red 'fro retro, Atlanta got the red look
I be turning heads everywhere you see me step foot
Check stub full of commas, told you I was next up
Rollin' through Gwinnet I hit up both and now we're thista
Made a play on Pleasant Hill rolling through Sonesta
Phone ringing, I don’t answer so they blow my text up
Going the speed limit, police are eager to arrest you
Plus I had a lot of drank, I’d probably fail the breath-a
Lyzer test, change it up, I’m back to rhyming I confess
I think I’m the best , besides a couple guys alive or dead
Running over rivals, tire tread
Their entire head busts just like a virus spreading virally and I infect
Non-believers, fighting like a fly inside my spider web
Tell them give me my respect, climbing up a flight of stairs
Finessin' rhyming since the first Vanilla Ice was said
Ain’t nobody try me yet, I just pray to God I said

[Hook]
Forgive them for their sins, my lord
They know not what they do
I’ve been trying to ignore the things they say to ruin my mood
Never know what I’ve been going through lately if they only knew
They’d watch the shit they say before they make me lose my cool...
Fuck around and lose my cool...
A A A town shit
A A A town shit
A A A town shit
North side, A town shit

[Verse 2]
What you know about being the only white boy
Deep in the hood, in the city, waiting for hours trying to do a song
You hit the stage, you could tell they wanna boo you off
Before you even get started you gotta prove 'em wrong
Or say fuck 'em, my chain tuck 'em, my jewelry on
Go head pull your gun, I hope you’re shooting to kill
The few screws that I have inside my head already loose
Go head shoot me, I’m suicidal, I’d do it myself
I might have got a record deal 'cause I rap good
But before you ever heard of me I earned my respect
I kept it cool with people, some were scared to come to my crib
Stories going around Gwinnett about the ones who got the gas
Wolf, by the cash door
Blaming me for what my boys did, Moreland oh nab bind over Jorlan, Homie Rj’s shortin' them for dollar bills
People pullin' pistols on me saying who this white boy is
And I ain’t saying this to try and be hard, but I ain’t fought no games
Don’t believe me had some boys act strange
They done toured with me, can be sure
That they knew if someone pissed me off, I’d swang 98
Homie shot a lady and a baby, point blank range
And he set 'em on fire in the trunk of a car
My best friend in sixth grade killed a lady for nothing
Now he’s a manager at Denny’s, Servers call him the The Boss
The point I’m tryna get across is I got a heart
I don’t wanna harm anyone, but I’ma finish what they start
Got an emptiness and dark side in me 'cause I’m scarred
People start to think you’re soft, when you’re caught without your guard
Thinking you’re an entertainer and the odds are getting got
Talking shit ain’t gonna happen, get the addy where you are
Pull up on you with the crew pull your car
Fuck a fade, we’re gonna stomp you like we’re putting out a fire
Pray to God like

[Hook]
Forgive them for their sins, my lord
They know not what they do
I’ve been trying to ignore the things they say to ruin my mood
Never know what I’ve been going through lately if they only knew
They’d watch the shit they say before they make me lose my cool...
Fuck around and lose my cool...
