[Verse 1: Tech N9ne]
(CHEAH)
I just wanna party, hit the drink until I'm numb (CHEAH)
I'm the nigga with the pineapple and malibu rum (CHEAH)
Plus the 151, I'ma get you stupid doo doo dumb (CHEAH)
Get the nookie when the cookies feelin' good up in her lungs (CHEAH)
Hella faded when I get up in the spot I hit the bar...(CHEAH)
Everybody want a photo with the Nina, I'm a star...(CHEAH)
And if anybody want it my nigga 'zilla got the gun
But we just wanna kick it and pick up a couple bitches
Who be looking so delicious, we give them all of they wishes
Then we done (done)

[Hook: Darrein Safron]
My crew's all tripped out, off that real good green
The liquor's taking over, and we just wanna party
(This shit we) party, we just wanna party
(This shit we) party, we just wanna party
This shit we party, Sunday Monday Tuesday
Wednesday Thursday Friday, through the weekend

[Bridge: Tech N9ne]
Saturday to Sunday she be calling in on Monday
I live in the Boonies, if your ride is outie, then it's like you're traveling with a one way

[Verse 2: Tech N9ne]
We wanna put D on her
We gone, we zoned, in a weed coma
She don't belong if her squeeze phone her
And he want leads on where the G's home was
Ease on, she won't get to breathe on us
Tea's gone, we bone bitches elong' us
See schlong, she moan when I deep dong her
When he's grown, he is known to s-neeze on ya
Beez Holmes, we Jones'd, for the V on her
She's long, these songs get ya free dome
For the weed blown with the tone like I'm Steve Stone brotha
Keep on, be strong, never no leash on us, we beast on ya Biancas

[Hook: Darrein Safron]
My crew's all tripped out, off that real good green
The liquor's taking over, and we just wan- (hold up)

[Verse 3: Rittz]
Party animal, looking hammered, couple of handles of
Crown, we pound the shot cause it ain't shit for me to handle my
Liquor buzz, and bitch I wanna get to bust it open for the gram of Molly
Got her pupils huge, her hands are clammin' up
Took advantage of the situation now she dancing to
My music when I turn around she taking her bra and panties off
Tan lines looking like she just got back from Panama
See these sparks flying like I lit a Roman candle up
Damn I just, can't think of your name, what is it, Angela?
Amber, Tammy, Pamela? I blame it on my Xani buzz
But blondie all my homies wanna hit it, so I hand her off
Pimping since an infant, I can't help that I'm the center of
Attention, trying to get paid, like Travis O'Guin, you see the symbol of
Snake and Bat, The Famous Stars and Straps, the Gucci signature
The ring that's on my pinky, you should throw the deuces, beam me up
Go stupid in the booth, I'm flexing like I'm Lou Ferrigno, ya-uh-yeah!

[Hook: Darrein Safron]
My crew's all tripped out, off that real good green
The liquor's taking over, and we just wanna party
(This shit we) party, we just wanna party
(This shit we) party, we just wanna party
This shit we party, Sunday Monday Tuesday
Wednesday Thursday Friday, through the weekend

[Outro x2: Darrein Safron]
Girls just wanna have fun (hold up)
Guys just wanna get fucked (hold up)
