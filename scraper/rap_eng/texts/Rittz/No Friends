[Hook: Rittz]
No! No! No! No! No! No! No!
I ain't got no friends
Shit, I ain't fuckin' with them
I'm even havin' trouble trustin' kin
Man, I ain't got no friends
Shit, I don't spot no tens
Hang around when you got no ends
I ain't got no friends
Mothafuckas sayin' we been tight
But there they go hatin' again
I ain't got no friends
Fuck the world, and my boys, and my girl
Fuck family and my best friend
I ain't got no friends
No! No! No!
I ain't got no friends
No! No! No!
I ain't got no friends
No! No! No!
I ain't got no friends
Fuck the world, and my boys, and my girl
Fuck family and my best friend
I ain't got no friends

[Verse 1: Rittz]
I'm a loner
Feel like everything changed when ya grown up
Seem like everyone I know from the motherfucker past life
Act like they don't wanna show love
Homie hold up
See me progress, wanna see me slow up
Got a show but they don't never show up
Guaranteed if I ever were to see a little dough
They gon' be right there when I blow up
Ridin' my coat tails, suckin' me dry
Bringin' me down with all the negative vibes
Sometimes I be thinkin' they wish I wasn't alive
And now I see it, no more, I ain't lettin' it slide
Same motherfucker that you thought was down
He tried to fuck your bitch when you not around
And he knows you love her
Knows you suffer with a broken heart
But still hopes to fuck her
Tryna joke and clown on you behind your back
Tryna hide the fact it feel good to tempt
Resentin' you for every cent you make
But wanna stay down with you till your ends are spent
So who can I trust? Can I trust my girl?
She won't ease of the leash a bit
She don't want me to succeed
So scared of cheatin' she'd rather me be a piece of shit
So she argue with me till my energy gone
Sick of never gettin' along with her
She gettin' on my nerves
Thinkin' all women are dumb
I'd probably kill myself if someone give me a gun
I'm cuttin' my ties with everybody that corruptin' my life
Don't even try to look me up in the eye
Pull your knife and shove it inside my back
I better rap at these motherfuckers despises
I ain't got no friends

[Hook: Rittz]
No! No! No! No! No! No! No!
I ain't got no friends
Shit, I ain't fuckin' with them
I'm even havin' trouble trustin' kin
Man, I ain't got no friends
Shit, I don't spot no tens
Hang around when you got no ends
I ain't got no friends
Mothafuckas sayin' we been tight
But there they go hatin' again
I ain't got no friends
Fuck the world, and my boys, and my girl
Fuck family and my best friend
I ain't got no friends
No! No! No!
I ain't got no friends
No! No! No!
I ain't got no friends
No! No! No!
I ain't got no friends
Fuck the world, and my boys, and my girl
Fuck family and my best friend
I ain't got no friends

[Verse 2: Rittz]
Homeboys that I grew up with
Start switchin' on me, bitchin' 'bout this music shit
They say I'm all about the movement Rittz
Then they take my kindness and confuse it with a weakness
I guess they wish they could fit the shoes I'm in
But they can't stand to see me in the spotlight
Sayin' Rittz done changed
He don't ever say our name on the stage goddamnit
I wish I could rhyme like him
I been tryna rap before for
Fifteen years and I still ain't got shit to show for
All my hard work and so forth
But I always figured I would have my homeboys up in my corner
But they been gone and talkin' shit behind my back when the doors are closed
Actin' like they deserve a little cheese just to wear my T-shirt and go to shows
If they were smart they would play their part but they're not
There so envious, I feel the tension just
Buildin' and I'm feelin'
Like it's time to separate the friendship from the business and
Mothafuckas only come around me hopin' they can benefit
Dick ridin' everyone I introduce them to
Like "Fuck Rittz, I do music too"
Embarassin' me when they look and I'm like "Who is you?"
I got a new motto "I ain't got no friends"
You ain't write a record for me
I don't owe you a dime
Either roll with us or we'll leave you behind
I don't really want the negativity on my mind
I'm finally cuttin' my ties with everybody that corruptin' my life
Don't even try to look me up in the eye
Just pull your knife and shove it inside my back
I better rap at these motherfuckers dispises
I ain't got no friends

[Hook: Rittz]
No! No! No! No! No! No! No!
I ain't got no friends
Shit, I ain't fuckin' with them
I'm even havin' trouble trustin' kin
Man, I ain't got no friends
Shit, I don't spot no tens
Hang around when you got no ends
I ain't got no friends
Mothafuckas sayin' we been tight
But there they go hatin' again
I ain't got no friends
Fuck the world, and my boys, and my girl
Fuck family and my best friend
I ain't got no friends
No! No! No!
I ain't got no friends
No! No! No!
I ain't got no friends
No! No! No!
I ain't got no friends
Fuck the world, and my boys, and my girl
Fuck family and my best friend
I ain't got no friends

[Verse 3: Shawty Fatt]
Ain't got no time, ain't got no talk
'Bout who gon' ride on they life
[?]
I done heard it all
I got you nigga, word is bond
I need you nigga, pick up the phone
He let me down, let me pick up the tone [?]
Don't he fuck with [?]
Didn't Wolf get signed to Interscope right?
What they talking 'bout, [?]
Yep the same amount of minutes
You got to get on before you die
[?]
Used to act like you don't know me guy
'Cause you smell a nigga about the chain
Look who's on my ding-a-ling
Guess who needs some bigger jeans
Guess who said I wasn't go blow
The same mothafuckas I left
I signed and smell the mothafuckin' gold
I am a mothafuckin' ho if I
Fuck with a nigga that ain't my kind
My water is 'sposed to be my [?]
I hung a nigga out to dry
Tossed me in like a poker hand
[?] pointin' me to the stand
I'll tell you everything we did
Flyin' up to them with them things like shit
Cooked up yellow dope that looked like piss
Everybody used to come buy his shit
One come out, one go in, fucked me up
Muthafuck a friend
[?]

[Hook: Rittz]
No! No! No! No! No! No! No!
I ain't got no friends

I'm even havin' trouble trustin' kin
Man, I ain't got no friends
Shit, I don't spot no tens
Hang around when you got no ends

Mothafuckas sayin' we been tight
But there they go hatin' again
