[Intro]
Fell a victim to myself again
But who's gonna help me when
I need 'em
Pray, they prey on my demise they can smell the scent
I'm weak and losing strength
I see 'em
You think when you're sinking they won't let you drown
The ones that you trust come and kick while you're down
They stomp you enough you won't get off the ground
Anymore

[Hook: Rittz]
When your worth feels under attack but you won't flee
When a person is shackled and trapped but they broke free
Double crossed, get stabbed in your back but you won't bleed
When it all falls flat but you're back up on both feet
In the end, you're indestructible

[Verse 1]
In the booth of the 214 on stage faking, you thinking it's all good
I was just in a green room
Had me crying looking at my lady lie in a pool of her own blood
Through a text, cut herself for something that I had done
Overseas, but I always get followed by bad luck
Bad time, I call on my homie but he ain't wanna console me
Instead he told me that Top of the Line sucked
He was buzzed like I was, going on Tech N9ne's buzz
Trying to fight the TM, I was in the wrong
I was sick, had untreated strep throat doctors didn't catch
Had a rash spreading up my arms
Spreading up my legs
A fever that stayed around for months
No days off, trippin, skin crawling in my bunk
Of course my voice would be hoarse for these huge crowds
I was dying, why the fuck he calling me a drunk
Damaging my reputation, need a restoration
Had to rest, to put a halt to all my calls
My homie think I'm dodging him outta desperation
He said he gonna kill himself, it's all my fault
This is deja vu, back in 2014 when I came home broke
Eight grand in the hole
Had to postpone having kids, owning a home
Gonna go through the motion alone 'cause

[Hook]
When your worth feels under attack but you won't flee
When a person is shackled and trapped but they broke free
Double crossed, get stabbed in your back but you won't bleed
When it all falls flat but you're back up on both feet
In the end, you're indestructible

[Verse 2]
Get comfortable, love the show
Adjust or fold the crutch you hold
You trusted those that cut your throat
That dug the hole, that stunt your growth
Disrupt the flow
The 'Net shot like it struck your pole with thunderbolts
You cut the flow that sucks you so, you search your soul, the bubble blowin'
You busted, poke and punch your hoes
You couldn't even walk on my shoe, barely scuffed the sole
And play a couple notes
Took a shot, smoke a blunt, maybe numb your nose like who cares
It's Rittz, bitch

[Verse 3]
Homie fresh up out of jail, violent environment
Tryin' hard to turn his life around and his mindset
Never had a nine-to-five, places he applied at
Said he wasn't hiring, he coming out retirement
I couldn't really blame him, hard to rearrange the wiring
Hear somebody bring the hotter game that they desiring
Entertaining, inquiring, cocaine pirates
Wrist game, whip-whip-whipping like a wire whisk
Scars on the skin been surviving in the fire pit
Hold on had 3rd degree burns
Gotta do your research on the people that you keep around assuming they believe in teamwork
Hate to see you coming up, wanna  see you reverse
Want us in the street curb when you tryna go straight
Always trying to throw shade but it never holds weight
But I got 'em in my scope, won't fold, won't break 'cause

[Hook]
When your worth feels under attack but you won't flee
When a person is shackled and trapped but they broke free
Double crossed, get stabbed in your back but you won't bleed
When it all falls flat but you're back up on both feet
In the end, you're indestructible
