[Verse 1: RyattFienix]
Is this right, is it what I'm supposed to do?
Will a piece of my heart always remain inside of you?
Will I ever be the same, can I ever get it back?
Because without you, I feel my life has gone off track

[Hook: RyattFienix]
And I wonder, is this the end of the road?
Is this suicide, suicide?
Lovestruck suicide?
And I wonder, should I have never let you go?
Is this suicide, suicide?
Lovestruck suicide?

[Verse 2: RyattFienix]
I lost myself when I let you go
Because I gave you everything, I gave you my soul
What a foolish thing for me to do
Because I'm completely empty now without you

[Hook: RyattFienix]
And I wonder, is this the end of the road?
Is this suicide, suicide?
Lovestruck suicide?
And I wonder, should I have never let you go?
Is this suicide, suicide?
Lovestruck suicide?

[Bridge: RyattFienix]
If the dial tone sounds one more time
I'm going to kill myself
X4

(phone ringing)

Pick up, pick up, pick up, come on

(dial tone, phone hangs up)

[Verse 3: Rittz]
Thinking about you, looking at photo albums
All on my phone for hours
Wishing you'd text, wishing I'd never said "I wish you the best"
We could have got through the issues we had
But instead I just picked up and left, I've been a bit of a mess
Sitting in restaurants, looking like I lost my best.. friend
Call you my lady, refusing to call you my ex
When I listen to music it just reminds me of you
The song deuces came on, and I wept
The fact that weâ€™re thru is too hard to accept
Can't even watch movies we saw together
I'm starting to reflect, starting to regret
The fact I suggested we separate, what was I thinking?
I overreacted ignoring a possible consequence-causing event
Got drunk and I called
And left you a message expressing my feelings
But you ain't responded
I can't sleep, I got you on my mind
On your Twitter, I'm starting to stalk you online
One day maybe you'll call me and find
Maybe we can be happy together again
If not, then I guess that I'm meant
I'll always regret what I did
I wonder if (damn)

[Hook: RyattFienix]
And I wonder, is this the end of the road?
Is this suicide, suicide?
Lovestruck suicide?
And I wonder, should I have never let you go?
Is this suicide, suicide?
Lovestruck suicide?
