[Verse 1]
Yeah
I went from forging my report card
Skipping courses with my boys
Smoking 'Ports up in the courtyard
Poor choices wasn’t going far
Rapping, hoping doors would open
I was sure to be a born star
I kept my sword sharp
Rhyming when I finally got a deal at thirty-two
I put the pedal to the floorboard
Proving I could score points for the label, playing forward
Steady waiting for the day to play the point guard
Either way I’m still onboard, still on tour
Sixty days and still long gone
Hard to explain the feeling placing on the Billboard charts
Whores rush the tour bus but you’re busted
You’re nothing but a dildo toy
Objectified, undress when you step aside
And sexy and set beside the leather, fluorescent lights
Set the vibe, never said goodbye, only next in line
This is life, catch a flight: this is my exercise

[Hook]
When the hard times come wave ‘em goodbye
In the end I won, time to take my victory lap
Stand up for me, whistle, and clap
It’s Last Call, homie, Rittz will be back
On the track put ‘em up
Put your peace signs up, have a good time
It’s been one good run, 'bout to take my victory lap
I’m thanking ya’ll for putting me on the map
It’s Last Call, homie, I’ma be back
I promise that
Ya-Uh-Yeah

[Verse 2]
They say I only rap fast but it’s my comfort zone
Before, the younger me stumbled on Thuggish Ruggish Bone
I’m like a bumble bee buzzing, functioning drunk and stoned
Did a bump a blow and smoked a blunt
And went and chugged Patron
Running like I recovered the fumble thrown
Running wrong way down the field, like fuck a go , internal compass broke
No direction coming from a place, you could tell it’s safe
Like you left the base and slid into the open home
Like the kid that’s eatin' lunch alone, I don’t belong
Raps redundant shit no wonder why they humming country songs
Switching up, giving up. Punctured holes sunk they boat
Throwing in the towel cause when they dug they never struck for gold
Fuck it , search your soul, you could grunt and moan
Like I used to do with you, you could just adjust your tone
Get the cream, fuck the cone
Fuck it, grow up, it goes up, but no one controls what you want

[Hook]
When the hard times come wave ‘em goodbye
In the end I won, time to take my victory lap
Stand up for me, whistle, and clap
It’s Last Call, homie, Rittz will be back
On the track put ‘em up
Put your peace signs up, have a good time
It’s been one good run, 'bout to take my victory lap
I’m thanking ya’ll for putting me on the map
It’s Last Call, homie, I’ma be back
I promise that
Ya-Uh-Yeah

[Verse 3]
I done been around this country more than I can count
Unfortunate my mind is cloudy. Why can’t I remember shit?
I done sold some albums, nothing to write home about
I hope that when I’m gone I’ll be remembered for my penmanship
I done noticed most of the rappers that I’ve met
Are egotistical but fool you like they got a humble temperament
From the outside looking in you think the game is what it ain’t
It ain’t the music it’s the money and percentages
Some business shit that you can't comprehend so don’t pretend you can
Shooting vids in alley ways, my Timberlands got bitches' shit
Up in the tread so bad  that they got trashed, they  was a Christmas gift
Shit like this reminds me of the time we wasn’t privileged
Penny-pinching wasn’t spending it, so frivolous
So this is for the fans in the beginning, they were listeners
And let me and music have a chance and I’m appreciative
My mission ain’t accomplished but you brought it where it is so

[Hook]
When the hard times come wave ‘em goodbye
In the end I won, time to take my victory lap
Stand up for me, whistle, and clap
It’s Last Call, homie, Rittz will be back
On the track put ‘em up
Put your peace signs up, have a good time
It’s been one good run, 'bout to take my victory lap
I’m thanking ya’ll for putting me on the map
It’s Last Call, homie, I’ma be back
I promise that
Ya-Uh-Yeah
