[Verse 1:]
Yeah
When the rest of the world go to sleep, I
I be getting drunk, probably on some kind of drug
Tripping looking at the street light
Tryna write a rap, on a laid back beat
But its hard, I'm on a speed high
The C-N-T my crew, we cool
But we grew up in the street life
In other words, we gon' sting 'em when they swinging at the bee hive
Rewind, ain't nobody reach out
Back when I was coming up, now they hit me and get mad if I don't reply
Where were you when I was cleaning out the deep fryer?
Didn't wanna swing by
Hoes saying he's fine, yeah right
Saying that I wanna fuck, she lying, she trying
I can tell by her face that her pussy smell like a sea lion
Only D she gonna get is denied
Couple grand inside my Levi's
T9 put me on, and he always wear red
But I swear if somebody disrespect him, I'ma check him
He don't gotta give a green light
Listening to Big Mike, rap music used to be tight
Some of it still is, but a lot of it is street hype
Back when I was praying I would make it
This ain't what I thought it'd be like, despite -
All the fake shit, I'm really happy to achieve my -
Childhood dreams and a ton of shit's sweet
Every now and then its sour like a key lime
And when it is I gotta remind me
That I made it to the big time
And I know I might not be as big as T.I
But guaranteed, if you see me getting behind
A microphone, I'ma bring the heat each time

[Hook:]
Cause I was born for this
I'm so lucky to be this fortunate
My life, my heart, my soul got poured in this
And I'ma keep going until my story ends
Until the Lord above me decides to turn my lights out
But for right now
I ain't trying to put this mic down
Stage is mine now

[Verse 2:]
Told my parents I was gonna make it one day
They ain't never look convinced
I was just a little kid at a young age
They probably thought it was a dumb phase
And I quit school, said I'm stupid, told me just wait
I regret it and I do, I was thinking I was cool
Started fucking with the drug trade
Just knowing I might end up blowing up big
I was finally of age, hitting up Atlanta at the club late
Doing every open mic, looking like a straight target
I was unsafe, in the middle of the hood
Only white boy on stage, had to let my nuts hang
Fifteen years later, all the work paid off
Kids coming tryna run game
Only difference is, I was a lyricist
Before the internet opened up the floodgates
When white boys had to have skills
If you didn't, then you getting booed, getting jumped
What you just say?
Had to live what you rapped back then
Nowadays you can say you 'bout gunplay
When you shot a target at a gun range
You can say you got a plug, I ain't following for the pump fake
Saying Usher's your cousin, your uncle is Just Blaze
As far as bullshit go, nothing much's changed
I'm getting better every year
All I see is competition to me that I wanna try to upstage
And there's still a lot of people that ain't never listened to me in their life
I think it's time to get an update
Rappers that I gave my demo tape to in the past
Tryna come and get my number, we should touch base
They could be me one day, but I'm hotter than a sun ray
I'm blazed

[Hook:]
Cause I was born for this
I'm so lucky to be this fortunate
My life, my heart, my soul got poured in this
And I'ma keep going until my story ends
Until the Lord above me decides to turn my lights out
But for right now
I ain't trying to put this mic down
Stage is mine now
