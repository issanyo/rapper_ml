[Verse 1]
Welcome to the Jonny Valiant show
I'm about to blow
Independent with a hundred thousand albums sold
Rappers used to crowd around me, funny now they don't
No one's in my lane, my competition going adiós
No magician but I dissipate 'em in a cloud of smoke
Revvin' they engine up and I'm a thousand miles down the road
You ain't ever heard of me, fuck it now you know
It's hard to take you serious and I ain't out of jokes
Most of the shit you rap about is unaccountable
Saying nothing, making noise with your mouth like Al Jarreau
Never seen an ounce of blow, flexin' like you Al Capone
Sink your teeth and we can seek a sweet like brownie à la mode
Pocket full of bread, I ain't counting sourdough
Shittin' on 'em from above, funny how the roles
Got reversed, when it was him, they never said "Look out below"
Never tried to lend a hand, I was down and out and broke
With no balance in my bank account and just a couple 'O's
Now we feastin' beef medallions while we toastin' Crown and Coke
Cheers. Weird. Where'd the talent go? Now it's like there's no one left
Someone said you blowing up, they trolling on the social net-
-Work. I murk my foes, I choke 'em out and never broke a sweat
You knock one out the box, now watch it cause a domino effect
And I’m a monster so these ghosts and goblins don’t impose a threat
I ain't scared of no one, seen a hater and I told him that

[Hook: Rittz]
If you don't start shit, there won't be none
'Cause I don't really need no reason
To be the one responsible for your extinction
'Cause when it comes to competition, I don't see none
They all went ghost on me
Ain't nobody coming close to me
It's like a goddamn ghost story
It's a goddamn ghost story
It's a goddamn ghost story

[Verse 2]
Go ahead and sound the horn, like every boring rapper does
I wish the dude behind the booth would pull the power cord
Just quit and do some shit you're good at
Your stage show is hard for me to look at
Like the unibrow on Al B. Sure!
The difference between our music's night and day
I'm getting busy but you shitty like a giant pile of cow manure
So watch that mouth of yours
I never thought I'd see the day it'd be okay to let these rappers dress like Shalamar
They wanna dance, suck a dick, fuck these kids, knock 'em off they balance boards
Beat 'em down and settle out at court
Ugly as fuck but these sluts pulling down they drawers
White bitches love me like an Abercrombie outfit stores
Sick and never found the cure, sipping on the Crown I poured
Wild and rowdy, bumping Scotty ATL and Alley Boy
Some dummy said I wasn't hungry since I made it and I'm famous
Bitch, I'm starving like the Army was in Valley Forge
Was dope enough to get a deal back in 2004
I was born a killer, tried to warn 'em, better tell the boys

[Hook]
If you don't start shit, there won't be none
'Cause I don't really need no reason
To be the one responsible for your extinction
'Cause when it comes to competition, I don't see none
They all went ghost on me
Ain't nobody coming close to me
It's like a goddamn ghost story
It's a goddamn ghost story
It's a goddamn ghost story

[Verse 3]
I'm just really being honest y'all
I'm just sick of being modest all the time
When all these artists talk like they the hottest and y'all
They don't get away with murder
They just rhyming words together, ain't no substance to their monologue
They go on stage and spray the crowd with water
Rapping over top they vocals to distract
The fact, they sounding awful dog
We ain't playing volleyball, I ain't going back and forth
If you diss me and then piss me off, then I might smack you for it
Run up in the studio while you were on like everything
It's coolio, I jack you for your laptop and your Mac keyboard
You think I'm playing? You mistaken
Shit, you faker than the movie Taken
You ain't got no skills, you only act the part
Come and get a battle scar, thicker shit that's caviar
You fictional like Battlestar Galactica and Avatar
I'm on another planet then these rappers I'm on Saturn, Mars
Venus, Jesus, we the C-N-T and we just laugh at y'all
An open casket, I just killed a Kato track
If you feel it, play it back
Really, I'm just stating facts that

[Hook]
If you don't start shit, there won't be none
Cause I don't really need no reason
To be the one responsible for your extinction
Cause when it comes to competition, I don't see none
They all went ghost on me
Ain't nobody coming close to me
It's like a goddamn ghost story
