[Intro:]
North Side
A-Town
Ye-uh-yeah, uh

[Verse 1:]
Can't find a lane? Then you should make one
We the future like an alien intruder with a ray-gun
Fly as fuck or scared of heights or aviation
You lookin' for someone as tight as me, there ain't none
Uneducated but I ain't dumb, paint shinin' on my Cutlass
She's my pride and joy like Stevie Ray Vaughan
Got a lot of dollars off my occupation
Jealous, poppin off, it's obvious they pocket change shrunk
Now they wanna come apologize and make up
Got ho inside em', they should go apply at Avon
And those the type of guys I try to stay away from, they be too lame, but they say they keep it A1
I bet I lay one
Out across the pave-ment
If they say somethin', I don't play no types of games son
I'm representin' where I came from
North Side of the A, bitch until the day my grave's dug
Standin' straight, weight on my shoulder weigh tons
Representin' Clintel-Strange-Slum it's Rittz bitch!

[Hook:]
My time has finally come to take what's mine
I see my past life behind me, I just wave goodbye
I'm reachin' for the stars, I'm reachin' for the stars
I finally see the stars align
I'm reachin' for the stars, I'm reachin' for the stars
I finally see the stars align
It's about that time

[Verse 2:]
Look, I heard your entire tape and wasn't inspired
It was hard for me to make it through but since I'm a - rapper
I feel like I should listen, now I'm wishin' that I didn't
I would rather watch an episode of Empire 10 times
And I don't even like the show, chopping rocks of white
Just know I tried to crush it up but then my license broke
Your style's old like yellow stripes on [?] and wire spokes
It's time to go, I know your goal ain't to retire broke
But on a brighter note, they might be hiring at Kohl's
Try Verizon Wireless, there's always people buying phones
Drunk or flying drones, crowds at shows are multiplying
Fire marshal tryna say we violating codes
Spraying my cologne, smelling like a millionaire
Silver pair of Jeremy Scott's I hardly ever wear
Black hoodie but the fabric's made of leather
Looking fresh like I was Fred Astaire, with a better head of hair
With no fedora on, fuck is going on?
Rappers dressed like Def Leppard, so, "Pour Some Sugar On Me" in the name of love, I ain't never changing up
I be backstage with the - bitches in there taking bumps
Love to blow a dick so much she just might suck the pigment off the skin
And when you nut she rubs it in like it was facial scrub
Too busy getting money, I can't conversate with ya
And I don't rap for free, I want some compensation, bruh
Mike was cooking up the beat, he hung his apron up
And when he did I picked my pen and paper up
It's Rittz, bitch

[Hook:]
My time has finally come to take what's mine
I see my past life behind me, I just wave goodbye
I'm reachin' for the stars, I'm reachin' for the stars
I finally see the stars align
I'm reachin' for the stars, I'm reachin' for the stars
I finally see the stars align
It's about that time

[Verse 3:]
Listen, I'm not your homie bro, we barely know each other
You think we close because we did a couple shows together
Some folks I met on the road, I'll probably know forever
You just kissing ass, always asking, "Can I open for you?"
I got a talent for spotting hidden agendas (Like what?)
You tryna copy me, watching like an apprentice (Hell nah)
I'm not Italian but I got some homies down to do a hit for me
They caught him and shot him in his appendix
It's funny all these dudes, they shoes and scarves
And thinking they look original but they copying Jimi Hendrix
But everybody's looking for something like Annie Lennox
I'm looking for someone to bring the Xanax
Higher than Bob Ross, watch me while I paint the canvas
And you just a ho, I figured you oughta know, shout out Alanis
Morrissette, portraits I painted, ain't it gorgeous?
Still I made a fortune, Porsches and Corvettes
Run up with the torch lit
Run off at the mouth and we gon' show up at your doorstep
Fuckboy, probably think he fly inside his Ford Flex, pocket full of Boar's Head
Cheddar but never seen competition, doomed to corpses
You must've been born deaf, really you can't be serious
You making Silkk the Shocker sound like he's the greatest lyricist
That ever lived, that's not a diss, I'm just comparing them
I might not be the biggest fish in this aquarium
But everybody in the water scared to fuck with me
So fuck I'm chalking up the piece, slumping in my bucket seats
Like, Riiittzz Biitchh

[Hook:]
My time has finally come to take what's mine
I see my past life behind me, I just wave goodbye
I'm reachin' for the stars, I'm reachin' for the stars
I finally see the stars align
I'm reachin' for the stars, I'm reachin' for the stars
I finally see the stars align
It's about that time
