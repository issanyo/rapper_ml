Niggas wanna wake me up
Bitches wanna set me up
Judge wanna give me time (time)
Gotta keep my head up (head up)
Me against the world like pac
Middle finger up, mothafuck the cops
All gas, no breaks, thankin god for another day
Cancer took my grandma away, poppin pain pills, still feel the pain
In a chain gang, slang gold chain, out the chain gang, do the same thang
Ridin through the rain
All white range, all about the money, mothafuck the fame
Police know my real name, call me by my nickname….hitman

I cried I cried
My hearts full of misery
I cried I cried I cried
My hearts full of misery
I cried I cried

All my life I been rappin tryin make it big I always figured I was suppose to blow
15 years later got my paper wait this ain't the way this suppose to go
My neighbors finally buzzin but it wasn’t big enough for me to go and quit my 9 to 5
So between this job and music now my lady sayin that she feel unsatisfied
I'm just baffled, just had her wrapped around my finger
Man it seems I lost the upper hand, same week my mixtape dropped
She admitted that she had been seein another man
So now I gotta bounce, outta mommas house, I just lost my bitch, I just lost my crib
I been poppin tags, hopin the pills will heal the way I feel, but nothing ever did
Shit the pressure of my managers be stressin me to work, you need to write some songs
Got one of the hottest wives decided to end it
How do I even begin to act like nothings wrong
My homeboys is shiesty, think they might be happy
That im down and going through a thing
100 dollars to my name, if you look behind these Gucci frames man I’m...

I cried I cried
My hearts full of misery
I cried I cried I cried
My hearts full of misery
I cried I cried
