[Hook]
I'm only human
It's hard to count all of my mistakes I've made
I'm only human
Don't have the power to save the day, I can't
I'm only human
Nobody's perfect, I've been ashamed of things I've done
I need improvement, I need to work it
So many things for change to come
I'm only human

[Verse 1]
We all breathe the same air, share the same living space
Breath the same from the day that we came up out our mom's womb
Character traits from our parents, we behave how we've been taught to
Identify by a country, and a state, and a race, and a faith we belong to
From our face, what we're  labeled and named we respond to
All too innocent until we get imprinted from the images we witness
And eventually resemble what we gone through
Some people say the shape of your fate is beyond you
Other say that fate is what you make it
I try to do right 'cause they glue you up to state when they see you make a wrong move
But I ain't superhuman, I don't got a cape or a costume
Homie on the dog food, thought he got clean
Talkin' to him, all he doin' is nodding out sleep
Who am I to judge him? Hard for me to drink and not fiend
Scared they gon' find my dead body on the box-spring
Know a lot of cool chicks, some with daddy issues
Hard to tell how many men have been up in her mouth piece
Men fuck a ton of women, they a certified pimp
When the shoe was on the other foot, they holler out freak
Like she isn't wife material
Both got venereal diseases, burnin' while they piss
Friends in long-term relationships, lying to each other
Never told them about the dirt they went and did
Kids acting out, searching for a dad
Young adults feel at fault to their parents 'cause they want a college grad
I can background check you, do research about your past
But I never know that person in the flesh 'cause

[Hook]
I'm only human
It's hard to count all of my mistakes I've made
I'm only human
Don't have the power to save the day, I can't
I'm only human
Nobody's perfect, I've been ashamed of things I've done
I need improvement, I need to work it
So many things for change to come
I'm only human

[Verse 2]
Like the girl on Instagram tryna show her body off to get more likes
Had a dude who got in trouble 'cause his girl saw him hit the heart sign
Waking up, embarrassed, my manager pissed at me 'cause I was drunk on live
Last night on my phone doing blow like it's cool when I know it ruins lives
Several times it almost ruined mine, what a waste
Wanna lie like I'm doin' fine, but I ain't
Wanna quit before it's too late, pump the brakes
Insecure, I wanna lose weight, but I can't 'cause I drink socially
The only way that I can function
Dissing people in the public based off an assumption
When I should have called and had a one-on-one discussion
Disgusted, I'm cussing out someone I trusted
Guilty and the glove fit
Stuck in a rut, hit ignore the minute that my friends called
Last Christmas I was dissed, feeling pissed and I went off
Fuck I wish I didn't involve my in-laws
Fist's all swollen, giant hole inside a thin wall in my living room
And ever since it's been a pitfall
Really need my family, I don't never call them ask them how they kids are, tell them I miss y'all
Can't ignore the insults, thought I had a thick skin, you could just unfollow me, don't gotta leave the ten cents
Caught up in this business and I don't really fit in
Call on my prescription to calm me down like Prince did
I don't got a spotter when I bench press all the pressure on my chest
Lost another friendship hopin' they forgive me, I forgive them
This wasn't my intention

[Hook]
I'm only human
It's hard to count all of my mistakes I've made
I'm only human
Don't have the power to save the day, I can't
I'm only human
Nobody's perfect, I've been ashamed of things I've done
I need improvement, I need to work it
So many things for change to come
I'm only human
