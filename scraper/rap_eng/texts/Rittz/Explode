You sleepin' on me then that's your loss
The shit I hear you listening to the type of music that I’m bored of
Some of you dumber than a door knob
"Blowjob Betty" I’ll be in my super sport bumping short dog
Old-school even if I could afford a sports car
Funny all the sudden it’s popular to support us
Riding cross the country in my tour bus
Throwing up the north still reppin Lawrenceville and Norcross
Lilburn, still burn, still on that pure soft
Pop a pill when I feel like it wore off
Cli-N-Tel, we don’t chill with these morons
Strapped but my steel is concealed from the warthogs
Paint a visual got the skill of a Warhol
Signed a record deal pop the cork off of some champagne
With my lady she was down when I was broke so I would never go and leave her for a stripper or a porn star
Fuck a judge and his scorecard
Your magazine don’t cover me your company been doing a poor job
I’ve been going hard in Atlanta since the 90s motherfucker now you finally want to try to get on board nah
I don’t got no friends only checks to get
See my crew riding from Cheshire Bridge to Breckenridge
Perfected this so they’re expecting nothing less but excellence what you expected bitch

[Chorus]
The spotlight is on me I'm ready to go for the gold
I've waited my life for this moment I'm 'bout to explode
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh [x4]
I've waited my life for this moment I'm 'bout to explode

My goal is so close I'm focused
This Journey's been like a roller coaster of broken roads
Back when I was broke and hopeless
And hoes would look at me like I was gross, repulsive
Now they’re showing up the shows with posters
Posing naked and posting pictures, it got me mixed with emotions
Write about the past, try to live in the moment
Same past where the happiness was the missing component
(I’m) bout to murder competition opponents are Foes get exposed
They talking shit I’ll dispose them
Find the king of the throne throwing stones at his army
The Holy Ghost inside me I’m feeling so explosive
Listen to my flow and under go hypnosis
Snakes crawling all around me seeing boahs, cobras
People acting like theyre gangsters the Stallone's Travolta’s
Both impose a threat to me but I believe in destiny and God has been directing me, the road is chosen
Weight of the world on my shoulder with scoliosis
(but I’m) electrifying like a jolt of voltage
Diamonds on my necklace shinin like a bowl of goldfish
Ain't no time to rest cause I know I got dough to go get
Sick of penny pinching like I’m trying to hold some roach clips
Busted through the wall I was poking holes in
I was meant to be the centerpiece I’m sick of playing second base to anyone
The day has come to blow, exploding and

[Chorus]
