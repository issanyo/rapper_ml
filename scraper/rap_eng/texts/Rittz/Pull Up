[Intro]
This is for everybody on that motherfuckin west side, that east side, that south side, and that motherfuckin north side

[Verse 1]
You might see me cruising with my crew inside my Buick Regal hard top
Might see your reflection cause I'm fresh up out the car wash
Crankin the music up we flexin while the neighborhood watch
Trunk boomin speakers beatin like the school of hard knocks
Clintel the movement stupid got a large knot
In my pocket they be hatin' on us cause they squad's squat
Local legend I don't got no beef I call shots
North Side representer I've been given carte blanche
Riding Beaver Ruin I just rode this shit from 29 on Buford Highway
Smokin out from Berkmar High to Norcross
Its ghetto up in Meadowcreek I bet if these police they see me riding
They gonna pull me over just because, watch
There ain't shit to do but catch a buzz and bar hop
Chillin in my car parked, smokin' hit the unlock button
Got my door propped open and a couple hoes inside of a Corolla pull up on me and they jaws drop
Pleasant Hill to Pleasantdale smoked so much we left a trail
Bumping Jazzy Belle and Extraterrestrial
Snortin lines SNL
Tryin to bite my fresher feel
Life is like a movie this the director's reel
Blowin kisses to these bitches got 'em catchin' chills
Catchin' feelings bet you if I met you you gon' let me drill
Like a Craftsman or Black and Decker back and better than before
I got em screaming "Ye-uh Yeah"

[Chorus]
They be yellin' when I pull up, pull up
They be trippin' when I pull up, pull up
Ladies love it when I pull up, pull up
All the bitches they be wishin' they was ridin' when they see me driving I pull up, pull up
They be waiting when I pull up, pull up
Haters hatin' when I pull up, pull up
Tell that mother fucker watch his mouth cause I'll pull up on you
I'll pull up on you
All the bitches they be wishin' they was riding when they see me drive away

[Verse 2]
I'm a pull up, reclining on em I ain't tryna scoot up
I'm shinin' on em now they look at me like I done blew up
Next time you say Atlanta then you better not have screwed us
The Clintel the crew and our respect is overdue but
They hate I'm getting paid and I don't have to push a broom a
Cross the kitchen pockets sticking like I'm made of rua
Plus up in a shooters alley where my homie blew a few bucks
We left to get some food, he said he knew a ho at Hooter's
That had to sit with friends that were fans and if they got a chance
To come and party with us they would let do what
Ever so I hit up my connect and and got some mollys
Try to start up a menage pourin' vodka and Kahlua
It's just another day in her life like I just drew a
Picture for you like I'm sitting for the interview with Don Shula
I can coach you how to move like I maneuver
Said I do the kool and fuck if you a goon or you a shooter
You're assuming I'ma sweat on you like Harry Connick Jr
Slide up to you missy have you screaming ooh aah
I might be in Tucson, Arizona maybe in Missoula
Might be with a country bitch and pull up in Dacula
I might cuss her out drop her off and throw the deuce up
Crazy like I lost a couple screws out my tool box
Bitches try to lay me like they met me at a luau
Police say my music too loud they be yelling when I pull up

[Chorus]
They be yellin' when I pull up, pull up
They be trippin' when I pull up, pull up
Ladies love it when I pull up, pull up
All the bitches they be wishin' they was ridin' when they see me driving I pull up, pull up
They be waiting when I pull up, pull up
Haters hatin' when I pull up, pull up
Tell that mother fucker watch his mouth cause I'll pull up on you
I'll pull up on you
All the bitches they be wishin' they was riding when they see me drive away
