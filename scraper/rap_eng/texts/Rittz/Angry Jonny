[Chorus: Poe]
Jonny, Angry Jonny...
This is Jezebel in Hell
I wanna kill you
I wanna blow you, away
I wanna kill you
I wanna blow you, away

[Bridge: Rittz & (Poe)]
Ya Uh, Ya Uh Yeah
(Jonny, Angry Jonny...)

[Verse 1: Rittz]
We been together like forever crying everytime I reminisce
Remembering how happy we was, sadly it's been a minute since
I look at you I see the man I miss
You changed so much over the years it's like there's barely a resemblance
Of who we used to be, I never thought that you'd be physically abusin'
I wish I knew how bad your temper was
When I met you I'd of left you but instead you acted like you never hit me
On several different instances
You get belligerent the other night I couldn't breathe
Had me pinned against the wall cause I received some instant messages
And I don't even know that guy, plus I would never cheat
I caught you cheatin' on me once but I was scared to leave
I can't believe I told you yes when you said "marry me"
You used to cheerish me I think you need to see some therapy
Hystericaly I wake up in the morning cryin'
Horrified I'm going blind couldn't see the warning sign
Comin' Jonny

[Chorus: Poe]
Jonny, Angry Jonny...
This is Jezebel in Hell
I wanna kill you
I wanna blow you, away
I wanna kill you
I wanna blow you, away

[Bridge: Rittz and (Poe)]
Ya Uh, Ya Uh Yeah
(Jonny, Angry Jonny...)

[Verse 2: Rittz]
Getting sick of putting up with this shit
It's bad enough you used to slap me now everytime
That we have a spat you clutching your fists you hit me like I'm a man
Black and blue, trying to mask it with make up and sunglasses
Going to work telling my boss that I slipped
You say I'm not allowed to talk to my friends
Like I'm a prisoner, if I was to mention getting divorced I'd be dead
I know it
I should have fled or filed for a restraining order, it's torture
You pushed me when I was going down the steps
To reassure if I left you that I'd regret it for good
You stood above me, yelling at me, on the floor while I bled
Being forced into sex when the thought of fucking you just makes me cringe
So bad it's getting hard for me to play pretend
Self-esteem so low that I can go get naked in a mirror and see myself as I add up all the days I spent
Telling lies inside a hospital
I bet they wonder why I never called the cops on you
Cause I love you Jonny

[Chorus: Poe]
Jonny, Angry Jonny...
This is Jezebel in Hell
I wanna kill you
I wanna blow you, away
I wanna kill you
I wanna blow you, away

[Bridge: Poe]
Jonny, Angry Jonny...

[Verse 3: Rittz]
This was never the way I wanted to live
I never thought that this would come to an end
And if it did I figured I would be the one that be dead
I begged you not to buy that gun but you did
I bet you wished you never showed me where you had it hid up under the bed
Everytime you pulled it out when you were drunk I was scared
You use it on me, I finally had enough of your shit
And your demons no more bleedin' no more mistreatin' me cheatin' repeatedly, me pleading to stop beating me
Jesus I gave you everything you wanted all I wanted back
Was your love but really I was just your punching bag
And if I go to hell for killing you I'm willing to
I feel like you done already took me to hell and back Jonny
And I can tell I caught you by surprise
From the expression in your lifeless eyes
Say my goodbyes to my one and only
While I'm standing in the puddle by your bloody body
I love you Jonny
