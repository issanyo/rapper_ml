[Verse 1 Rittz]
Do you remember when ('member when)
We had our first argument arguing (arguing)
I was on the love seat you was on the ottoman
And we were talking shit
I called you a whore you're jaw dropped when I called you it
You punched me in the mouth with a closed fist
I choked you right and front of your mom and them
Do you remember that 'member that
We was at my nephew's Christening and you were mentioning mentioning
Some dude that you screwed and instantly I got pissed and we
Started causing a seen cussing loud in the parking lot at the church
You scratched me then I slapped you then we went home and fucked right afterwards
I think that were

[Hook]
Meant to be meant to be
We got a special chemistry
With a lotta drunken memories
But I'll always love you endlessly
But sometimes love results in injury

[Verse 2]
We get drunk to fight (drunk to fight)
That's like what we do for fun
The condo we moved in was brand new till we argued throwing shit
You would punch a bunch of holes in the wall holes in the wall
You remember when you broke the door so many carpet stain I throw coke in your
Face you spit on me hoping to provoke me more
I ripped your necklace off then the dog would run
Then your mom would come trying to instigate
That night that you hit with me the dinner plate
I pissed and I hit you with the Wendy's bag
I took the burger out and I mushed you with it
You were hungry to I slung all the fries in the hall
Then you hit me in the balls and cried
Other couples hang with us and be like God you guys are just

[Hook]
Meant to be meant to be
We got a special chemistry chemistry
Whole lotta drunken memories memories
But I'll always love you endlessly endlessly
But sometimes love results in injury

[Verse 3]
So many vacations got ruined we fucked up Disney Land
We got into a huge fight that sucked we showed out right in front of
Your brother and his wife but Fuck that whats they get for inviting us
We don't know no better we get hype and drunk
Me at the Hawks game I was trashed blacking out
Going up to groups of dudes and I said You some diesel motherfuckers that I need to slap around
They coulda fuck me up thank God they didn't
We shoulda went to jail fighting by the conference center
I threw your brand new cell out the window you threw mine too
Then you ripped off my car antennae
Kelly and Charlie's that wedding was the worst of all
I think the whole hotel could hear
Us screaming and fighting cussing and fussing and fucking
Everyone could tell that we're

[Hook]
Meant to be meant to be
We got a special chemistry chemistry
With lotta drunken memories memories
But I'll always love you endlessly endlessly
But sometimes love results in injury
