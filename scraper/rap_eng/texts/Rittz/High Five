You ain't gotta tell 'em bitch

[Verse 1]
Everybody lookin' ever since they sayin' where'd he come from?
From the north side of Atlanta Tropicana
Bubblegum in the blunt [bom bom bom]
Beatin' in the trunk, in the donk cutaway
Straight beatin' like a tom-tom drum or a gun stump
Feel the cocaine that I snorted
Come on buddy, shut up when you see us fly by
Snapback full of buddha and a cooler full of Highlife
Somebody gimme high five
Jeremy Scott Adidas on my feet, they got the biggest pinky ring
You ever seen upon a white boy's hand
White boy going ham, y'all wearing tight jeans
Going glam, going going going damn
Got 'em buzzin' in the club like boing boing blam
Like a fat couple fuckin' in a Dodge Ram
Cup fulla Crown, who drunk as I am? (I am!)
You ain't yet! Let me dive in
That fro like a retro porn star
Pocket fulla money, I don't gotta go to Coinstar
Now I'm at a four star
Restaurant, eatin' foie gras
Waiter comin' to the table, sayin' voilà
La la, tastin' like key lime pie
You can probably smell the weed when we ride by
Then it's back to the crib, back with a bitch, back in Gwinnett
And I'm buzzin' in my bee hive high
So stupid with it, flow so terrific, so futuristic, he's sci-fi
I know the magazine'll wanna gimme five mics
Feel like I'm the hottest MC times nine
Kick shit like a Kung Fu flick, hi-ya
'Bout to go down on this bitch, sky dive
Live from ya playlist, in ya iPod
It's Rittz in this bitch, can I get a high five?

[Verse 2]
Yela put me on the elevator goin' up
Any rapper steppin' to me on the mic I'mma bury him
I ain't scared of bein' arrogant, never gets
Hard, but these bars hard like a barbarian
Plus a motherfucker represent Slumerican
Wolf passed me the torch, course I'mma carry it
Now I'm in the limelight, I might take a hoe to see Twilight
Finger her inside the theater
And get some brain until I'm feelin' like Einstein
Why my, pleasure
I be at the party cuttin' lines on the dresser
Get a bitch high and undress her
Have her on the bed sceamin OMG like I'm Usher when I touch her
Yessir
Ain't nobody fresher I'm the next big thing thing
Homie I just wanna see my neck piece swing swing
Anybody wanna try and test me, ding ding
Swingin' on 'em like I'm in a wrestling ring ring
Kill a motherfucka like I'm Chris Benoit
You don't really wanna fuck with Rittz then boy
Blow another kiss to them bitches, muah
Have 'em screamin "Oh Lord" like a Christian choir
Man I'm finally on fire
If they only knew how much time has gone by
I got Crown up in my Styrofoam I'm
Poppin' X pills and I'm rollin' like a Firestone tire
Can I get a high five?

[Verse 3]
Rittzo go schizo when I'm sippin' on the Cristal
Swingin' like I'm Klitschko 'til my fists swole
Fuck around and I'mma split yo wig
Haters lookin' mad because I exploded
They was hopin' I would never get noticed
I don't think I've ever seen my dick so big
Got these bitches in they thongs like Sisqó did
In my '64 smokin' San Francisco shit
Ridin' 85 strapped like the Cisco kid
Want a sack, meet me where the cit-go is
Money stacked, can't get the shit folded
Kill a motherfucker then I dispose his
Dead body, bury him beneath a bed of roses
Mel Gibson bitch, I got my swisher lit
I'm 'bout to fill it with some killer, get a whiff of this
Pimp shit like fish and grits
Gwinnett County where they found me
In the valley of the crystal meth
Hello... good mornin'
Still sippin' coke with the Captain Morgan
Still reppin' Georgia, still fresh and gorgeous
Gotta a closet full of Pradas, Air Max and Jordans
Got a cutie smellin' fruity like an apple orchard
'Bout to torch it up, and you can tell by the smell I'm high
Everybody wishin' me well - likewise
Represent the Clintel, can I get a high five?
