[Verse 1: Jackie Chain]

Yeah I'm certified, stand still and I'm crew man
Paid my fucking dues man
Ain't got shit to prove man
Been around the block a few
Yeah I seen a thing or two
Sellin dope and get knocked up and getting back out ain't nothing new
So my city up five stitches
Movin packs and stackin britches
Ain't no slippin' strip club pimpin'
Getting money out these bitches
All day I get it in and all night I put in work
Pleasure house my enterprise I run the shit like Captain Kirk
SMKA beam me up, yellow glint up in my cup
Sour Deez up in my blunt, white girls backstage takin bumps
Hit the keg and fill my cup
Grab the crown and turn it up
All my partners slanging cuz'
Yo everybody burn it all

[Verse 2: Rittz]
Call me Rittz bitch this is that certified shit
They never should've let me in the music industry I'm 'bout to burglarize it
Every verse that I kick is murder I spit
Cuz' fill that blunt should maybe throw some herb inside it
With Jackie Chain smoking then it's got to be fire
Send me to prison I probably seem high
My girlfriend afraid that I'm a go up and do a bunch of coke and overdose like the Oxy-clean guy
But I don't got a weak heart
Eat bars, shock charge
Pop these my team not the geek squad
We gone, whose next we are
Yeah I said it we are
White Jesus, please god
Uh, middle fingers to the devil-man
You can try to be better then me and you never can man
Cause your girlfriend a fan
Got her backstage head-banging on my dick like she was singing for a metal band
Got Canadian whiskey in a dixie cup
I'm about to hop in so I'm a riding blazed
And the cops won't see my red eyes
So they hidin' behind some designer shades
Slumerican, a movement you ain't fucking with the crew and you would do it, see us dominate
S-M-K-A A A A they don't really want a problem 'eh
Cause we certified, yeah

[Verse 3: Jarren Benton]
Certified, Murder guys
Big dick bitch un-circumsized
Grim reaper nigga meet your demise
Put 'em in the dirt earth fertilized
Can't believe the nerves of guys
I bet I'll leave you terrified
And if you real then verify
That can't leave a mother fucker paralyzed
Hannibal Lecter petal through the metal detector
Then when I pull the metal who gonna protect ya?
Eat a nigga's heart for breakfast
I'm fucked up 7:30 you know I'm local and I'm reckless
East of my niggas in Texas
Eastside niggas the freshest
Might be in back of your Lexus
With a mask and duct tape, a machete
I'm ready to put the motherfucker over your neck bitch
Semi-auto, Demi Lovato
Give me a motto
A hole to swallow a whole 40 ounce bottle
I ain't got it all in my nachos
I ordered ground beef, the black beans, cheese, and avocado
Couple of toasts, a dope nigga we high
Leave a sucka' nigga floating on the seaside
I ain't gotta verbalize
Niggas know I'm certified
Mr. Benton nigga live from the East side
