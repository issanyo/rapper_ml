[Verse 1]
My wife's best friend Wendy, always been the life of the party
She come to chill with my girl at our crib
All three of us drinking from the night to the morning
Her personality is one of a kind, so funny
Make you laugh til you cry from a story
I haven't seen her in a while then my wife came downstairs
Crying saying "Wendy just called me"
Told me that she thought she had something wrong with her
For a long time, finally went and saw a doctor
They did an ultrasound, found cancer in her thyroid
That was rare and uncommon
Started crying harder, I was try'na calm her
She's the last person that I thought would ever get sick
She's a mom to Sebastian, Mia, and Karma
Hard enough alone, even worse with three kids
Lost a nine to five and the house where she lived
All her belongings that she used to own are gone
Stolen when her mom let her move into her home
Now they gotta go remove a tumor from her throat
Let you know that what you're going through could be worse
Such a strong person, I could never be her
Hoping all the chemo and the surgeries work
The redness on her neck is from the third degree burns
Hurting, try'na turn her head, losing weight, losing hair
Hard to understand her, can't swallow, can't talk
Can't drink water, nurse told her just nod
Choking on the burnt skin, got her coughing up blood
Got a feeding tube feeding through her stomach
Cause she does it when the meds
Ain't working 'cause the chemo got her sick
She could catch a virus easy on the treatment
The doctor says she's not allowed to be around her kids
Gotta smoke a cigarette saying she don't wanna live
But she done come to grips with it coming to an end
She ain't understand at the time
That she had the will inside to survive, dying wasn't in the plan
And she talk about her family and her friends
And her kids, what she been through
For them, she would do it all again
There are people that survived, but there's some that never did
I'm just happy that she's in the situation that she's in
She's alive

[Hook: Rittz]
They said my time was ticking, I was blown away
Tomorrow isn't promised, I can go today
They told me I was sick inside but I'm okay
Cause when I beat it and survive then I'ma say
Fuck cancer
If I go to bed and die before I wake
I'ma beg and pray the lord my soul to take
'Cause I ain't rolling over, I got total faith
I'ma win the battle, when I do then I'ma say
Fuck cancer

[Verse 2]
One of my best friends in the whole world felt a lump in his armpit
It was small so he thought it was a bruise
When he saw it getting larger, it started to alarm him
Tried to put it off for as long as he could
But he knew pretty soon that he's gotta see a doctor
When he did, they just said it was an ingrown hair
Don't be scared, 'cause it's probably not a problem
But he still want to get a second opinion so they sent him
To a place they recommended so that he could see a specialist
When they started to examine it, they said
"I hate to say it, I'm afraid that the lump is something cancerous"
Set him up for surgery
They removed the lump, he was try'na not to sweat it
Wondering what the result says
Waited three long days til he finally got to talk to the doctor
He told him he had Hodgkin's, third-degree cancer
That's a lot to process
When he told me, I was thinking anybody not him
He the type of guy that light a room up when he walk in
He just tied the knot, he's a newly wed, a husband
Thought of all the moments in his past, all the time spent
Doing drugs, chasing money, suddenly was nonsense
Told the lord above him he was done with that, I promise
Dying ain't an option, there's too much to accomplish
His father right beside him, caught a flight from Puerto Rico
Sweating out the chemicals inside him from the chemo
His wife was like his rock when he need someone to lean on
And when he's weak, she be motivating him to keep going
Didn't want no pity, only told so many people
Even shot a documentary when he was sick , so
He could reach the people in the same position
Maybe get some optimism
That it's possible to beat it and achieve gold
He's determined he gon' live to see another year
Turned his fear into anger
The anger that's inside of him provided him with strength
Now his vision's clear
Even when they told him he was sick, he never shed a tear
Til the day they called him up and told him he was cancer-free
I could see his mom up in heaven smiling now
Barely recognize him cause he lost a hundred pounds
Muscle bound, running miles, went and turned his life around
He's alive
