[Verse 1]
Yeah, growin' up we never knew what we was in for
Got the devil pokin' at you with his pitchfork
Thinkin' you'd be old and rich as fuck but now you piss poor
Plus you got a bunch of kids you got to fend for
Baby food and insurance
Ain't no optimism when you livin' life that you don't enjoy
You feel like jumpin' off the tenth floor
At ya 9 to 5, shoulda been a year since you been employed
Injured, I'm just tryin' to vent lord
My lady sick as fuck and I can't  get her insured
People at the hospital treated us like trash
No cash for the bills, no check to pay the landlord
I'm trynna write and set a benchmark
But its hard with all the drama in my life I gotta endure
At least I'm not up in the pen for
Somethin' that I did as a kid, bunch of men without a mentor

[Hook](x2)
Lost in the world, trynna find a way
Caught in the flames with no fire escape
Darkness replacing the brighter days
That's when I look up in the sky and pray and I beg
God, don't strike me down
God, don't strike me down
God, don't strike me down
If this my life, show me how to ride it out I feel...

[Verse 2]
Ain't no peaches, Sandy Beaches or no palm trees
Strong armed out of peace like it's beyond reach
Struggle since the day you had a heartbeat
Ten family members packed in an apartment like they sardines
Thought I had a Ozz beat
Newborn baby covered straight up in a car seat
And dreams of livin' like the Cosbys, are over when the
Homies that you grow up with are murderers and car thieves
Hustlin' on the corner in the harsh heat
Ridin' dirty in a rental car deep PD
Pull you over, handcuff you on the concrete
Said you got a warrant you're involved in a stolen credit card ring
The number of my homies gunnin' so it daunts me
Wish they were Here to see my name up on the Marquee
We put our glasses up for them and that Cairoc piece
Gettin' drunk, geeked up, singin' off key we

[Hook](x2)

[Verse 3]
God please forgive me
I had so much evil in me
As a teen and then we
Turned into grown men with no men to teach me
How to get rid of my demons that seem to send me
Further away from your spirit, I keep descending
And I keep befriending
The wrong people to be depending
On for positive energy but I keep extending
My hand out, family condemning me
My knees are bending
As I pray to you
I try to walk a straight line but the rope that's underneath my feet is flimsy
But I promise if I fall off, I'll keep attempting
And I know you heard that a hundred times, I keep on sinning
Been a loser all my life so it's hard envisioning me winning
In the name of Jesus, amen, I pray, I hope my life'll have a peaceful ending
Cause I'm

[Hook](x2)
