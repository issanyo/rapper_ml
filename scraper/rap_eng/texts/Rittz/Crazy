[Intro]
Yuh uh yeah
Burn one, Burn one

[Verse 1]
You ain't never seen an underground MC like me
Go harder, I'mma start a revolution
People talkin' shit but they don't wanna do none
Rappers wanna battle, lyrically execute them
Gruesome, super than a buffon, too dumb
Name hotter than the sun is over Tucson
People sayin "where the fuck dude from?"
Come and look, got 'em stuck, like I shot 'em with a glue gun
White Ice Cube stompin' with some black boots on
Got your girlfriend drinkin' on some Boone's Farm
Send her back to you drunk
You don't wanna kiss her 'cause I came inside her mouth
Now get the fuck up off the futon
On the paper route, I betta get a move on
If I ever wanna register with DuPron
To get the coupe with the roof gone
Tryna stack dough like a crew, son, pocket fulla croutons
Who got dope and on stupid purp
Will Power said here's a super hot beat you could merk
I'mma treat her like a loud mouth bitch
When I spit it's like I'm physically abusing her
White Jesus, I'm Lucifer
Toebiz cool shoes, then you don't wanna shoot the bird
I'll tell a wack rapper too berserk
Maybe they can study how to execute the verse
'Cause my pen may 'cause your balloon to burst
Don't nobody give a shit 'bout who ya worth
'Cause I can move the Earth and use the words I'm finally here
I came back from the future first, there's no maybes
I'm too for sure that these stars align, and this year is mine
Doin' a line of clear when they hear me rhyme 'cause I'm

[Hook]
Goin' crazy, too berserk, so high now I'm nuclear
Outta this world, I'm Jupiter, flow so tubular
And I'm smokin' crazy, stupid herb
Finally got a little loot to burn
Hops out the Cadillac hearse but you're finally here
I came back from the future first
To go crazy, too berserk, crazy, nuclear, crazy
I'm finally here, I came back from the future first
The DJ go crazy
Yee-uh

[Verse 2]
I'm an OG dog, when y'all was in the classroom
I was on the beats
I was gettin' geeked up, y'all was goin' to sleep
Y'all prolly goin' to college, I was all up in the street
Now the music industry is calling me
This big head should've never got released
Trans Am never should've let me off the leash
I'm a veteran, a G
I'mma eat mothafuckas like I'm Hannibal, a beast
Hungry for the money, I'm about to have a feast
When I'm battlin' I'm beast, and I let 'em know
Thinking we ain't deadly down in 7-7-0
Cinnamon and when I'm spittin' venom then they go
Lookin' now like another enemy below
They can see the fro, diamonds and the gold
Jewelery, you should be, shovelin' a pro
Back then gold diggers never would've spoke
Now you see these hoes at the show and

[Hook]
Goin' crazy, too berserk, so high now I'm nuclear
Outta this world, I'm Jupiter, flow so tubular
And I'm smokin' crazy, stupid herb
Finally got a little loot to burn
Hops out the Cadillac hearse but you're finally here
I came back from the future first
To go crazy, too berserk, crazy, nuclear, crazy
I'm finally here, I came back from the future first
The DJ go crazy
Yee-uh

[Verse 3]
Anybody lookin' for me you can find me in the A
Find me in the north
Riding in the Cadillac with Lamborghini doors
You can see me in The Source
Representin' Wolf, he the only reason that I even got an opportunity to make some noise
So you know I got his back, representin' Slumerican with the homie Shawty Fatt
G.C., G.A. is the damn campaign
Northside bitch, rep my shit, don't gangbang
Pop a lotta bars, drop a lot of shards
White boys ridin' 'round in Civics and Accords
Dope boys tryna make a livin' off of drugs
Jack boys tryna hit him lookin' at the buzz
We don't wanna fight nobody, we just wanna bust
My homies do the spit, when I do we get a rush
So I do it for the love, 'cause the music in my blood
When I'm in the club 'cause I must be

[Hook]
Goin' crazy, too berserk, so high now I'm nuclear
Outta this world, I'm Jupiter, flow so tubular
And I'm smokin' crazy, stupid herb
Finally got a little loot to burn
Hops out the Cadillac hearse but you're finally here
I came back from the future first
To go crazy, too berserk, crazy, nuclear, crazy
I'm finally here, I came back from the future first
The DJ go crazy
Yee-uh
