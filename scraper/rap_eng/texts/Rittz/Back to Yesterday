[Hook]
One day everything that I ever loved was gone
It all got stripped away
So now I'm crying inside and I wish I could turn the time
Back to yesterday
Let's go back to yesterday
Let's go back to yesterday

[Verse 1: Rittz]
Remember Valentine's Day 2010
She was so upset 'cause I had to go to work
We ain't got to spend much time together lately 'cause the rap was finally taking off, I had to put it first
My boss said one of us can take off early
I was like "me please" 'cause I wanted to surprise – her
So I drove to her job, turned my lights off in the parking lot 'cause she was getting off at 5
My stomach giddied out when she came outside
She was walking with a guy, laughing and something didn't seem – right
And when she noticed me she looked like she was busted doing something
Tryna kiss me, I said "who the fuck is he?" – my gut
Feeling was killing me, I couldn't even eat
'Cause I felt like she was hiding shit, I couldn't let it go
I asked her one more time "is there something going on between you and him?"
She looked at me and told me "I don't know!"
"You don't know?! What the fuck you mean? You've been cheating on me?"
She admitted her and him had kissed, crying
Telling me that all I do is spend my time writing, working nights, neglecting her, she don't love me like she did
Well the last 5 years were for nothing
Yeah we struggled but we loved each other now it's coming to a sudden end
Fighting, tryna move my furniture up out of momma's crib
Pack my shit, kiss our dog on the head then I left and I felt like
Death

Stayin' in the basement of my mom and dad's
Staring at her Facebook, every pictures that she posts
Every comment, tryna' see if she gon' call me back on an over lonely heart
My mama said it's gonna pass playing 80's music back to back, Johnny Hates Jazz "Shattered Dreams"
How am I supposed to live without you?
When I've been loving you so long
She already sending kisses, I wonder if she's started fucking him or not I bet you
I sent her texts saying "I miss you", she don't write back
I know I shouldn't but at night I like to ride past
The house I used to call ours yeah my name's still on the bills
Scared to switch 'em thinking there's a slight chance
That she's just going through a faze we'll get back together soon
But it's 2 a.m., I wonder where her car is
And how the dog is
I wish I could go inside and pet him
I never thought that you would ever do me wrong, bitch!
I need to calm down, sadness turn to anger
Xanax putting me into a deep depression
All I can do is wait now, shit I almost had a break down
Up at Tree Sound, we was mixing Wishin'
White Jesus just dropped everything I dreamed about when I was younger is coming true while I'm in this position
It's like my life is finally supposed to be the shit but isn't chewing on the barrel of my pistol
Never visioned that this bitch would do me like this

One day everything that I ever loved was gone
It all got stripped away
So now I'm crying inside and I wish I could turn the time
Back to yesterday
Let's go back to yesterday

[Outro: Rittz]
True Love:
True Love is counted by the health, well-being and happiness to another person to a greater degree than your own health and well-being and happiness
When you care for your saying of words, thoughts and actions, that’s specifically how you figure out a person. Your love

A Soulmate:
A soulmate is a person who’s perfectly suited to another person’s temperament
A person who strongly resembles another person in their attitude and belief
A close friend who completely understands them
A person who has the same beliefs and opinions as another person

A Douchebag:
A douchebag is someone who reads slow  at the end of a song
Just rinse the douchebag nozzle in warm water after using it
Let the douchebag dry completely, use twice a day
One day

[Hook]
One day everything that I ever loved was gone
It all got stripped away
So now I'm crying inside and I wish I could turn the time
Back to yesterday
Let's go back to yesterday
Let's go back to yesterday
