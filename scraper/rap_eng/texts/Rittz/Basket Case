[Verse 1: Rittz]
Self, self-pity, self-self pity
Why the fuck is everybody else giddy?
I woke up and felt shitty
Matter fact I felt the same all week
Let down like my last album on the shelf sitting
And I think I might need help getting out of bed
Cause I'm here and I keep spinning out of thread
I'm my own worst critic and I gotta write a album
But I keep hating on myself, it's like I get obsessed
Cause I hate what I write, say something tight
I be thinking too much wondering what they gonna like
I don't got a lot of fans, I'm afraid that I might
Let 'em down if what I make don't relate to them right
If it don't, then they ain't gonna buy my record
And if my second doesn't sell better than the last
I'mma owe the record label cash
So it's hard to relax and write raps
I be losing concentration sometimes
I look at what they saying online
Somebody unfollowed me and call me out cause I ain't respond
I'm behind on my deadline and I got a home life
To juggle ain't no free-time
My manager clowning, "what you write another deep song?
What is it this time, your lady, your struggle trying to be some{thing}?"
Not in the mood to write a weed song
I take the beat and give myself a mental beat-down when I rap

[Chorus: Rittz]
I'm my own worst enemy the energy I have's a waste
Cause I use it battling myself cause I'm a basket case
(Da, da, da, da) I'm a basket case
(Da, da, da, da) I'm a basket case
Staring at this glass of whiskey, wishin' I would pass away
But I'm always wishing for the worst cause I'm a basket case
(Da, da, da, da) I'm a basket case
(Da, da, da, da) I'm a basket case

[Verse 2]
I can't have conversation with rappers
I'm not an asshole to anyone unless I have a reason to be
But God forbid if they ever had a buzz or a name
Then they feel like we are equal, and these dudes always want a feature for free
I try to network and help 'em out, I just gave 'em a tweet
But I'm starting to wonder if the shoe was on the other foot
Would these motherfuckers do the same favor for me?
But, on the other hand, people think I'm all famous
I ain't half as paid as you think, when I tell 'em what the price is
To get me on a record they act like it's too expensive just to pay me a G
And I'm starting to feel guilty
Cause I'm known as the guy who never quit and never gave up his dreams
So a bunch of dudes tell me that I gave them motivation
Not to quit and they gon' try to do the same thing as me but
Only difference is, I spent fifteen plus years studying my favorite MCs
So I kept getting better some of y'all ain't got it, can't hear it, but it's blatant to me
And I don't want to hurt their feelings so I tell 'em that the music that they making is tight
But your image looks bad, and you suck, and you need to give up, and you're wasting your life
And it's all my fault... damn

[Chorus: Rittz]
I'm my own worst enemy the energy I have's a waste
Cause I use it battling myself cause I'm a basket case
(Da, da, da, da) I'm a basket case
(Da, da, da, da) I'm a basket case
Staring at this glass of whiskey, wishin' I would pass away
But I'm always wishing for the worst cause I'm a basket case
(Da, da, da, da) I'm a basket case
(Da, da, da, da) I'm a basket case

[Verse 3]
They tell me that I need to tweet more, but I feel kind of immature, typing my thoughts online
Plus the fans that I got will probably hate me if they knew what type of shit that crossed my mind
Cause I hate rap
Let me take that back, I just hate whack rappers for the most part
Even though I rap fast, I don't like when people try to impress me with double-time
And they be swearing that they go so hard
They don't really even say shit
Anyone can rhyme, thinkin' and drinkin' and sinkin'
Inside my Lincoln and think it's dope, it ain't about the speed
You gotta make it make sense
And did I mention that I really hate fake fans?
I don't understand how one minute everyone could be on your dick and they say you hot
A year later the same fans steady be talkin' shit 'bout that rapper Actin' like they forgot
That's how the shit works
First they love you, then they hate you, then they love you again
You gotta toughen your skin
This kind of shit hurts
This music industry is dumb, dumber than the comments on YouTube
Saying that I use the N-Word? (Hell Naw)
I don't rap like that, I don't hang around white boys who act like that
I done said too much, 'bout to snap, I'm mad
At the world, even I don't really have my back when I rap it's like... damn

[Chorus: Rittz]
I'm my own worst enemy the energy I have's a waste
Cause I use it battling myself cause I'm a basket case
(Da, da, da, da) I'm a basket case
(Da, da, da, da) I'm a basket case
Staring at this glass of whiskey, wishin' I would pass away
But I'm always wishing for the worst cause I'm a basket case
(Da, da, da, da) I'm a basket case
(Da, da, da, da) I'm a basket case
