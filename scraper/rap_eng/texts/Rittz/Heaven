[Intro: Rittz]
I wrote this song on mushrooms, I get all﻿ fucked up
It's like an illusion, I throw up, look in the toilet
It's like paradise, it felt so great

[Verse 1: Rittz]
Have you ever been to outer space?
Tour bus living liquor bottles all over, no counter space
Evaluating 'em I'm like what's the future's hard to calculate (Calculate)
Pissed off, but you gotta look at everybody putting on a smiley face
Like you seen the sun shinning on a cloudy day
You like the overcast you really hope it's that
Cause you like the darkness it's comforts you
Like-like-like-like-like a compass do
Buzzer 'em like you just-just blew a cazoo
Higher than a middle school kid huffing glue
Suckin' helium out from the balloon
Vick’s vapor rub sticks, we snort for fun
Knowing that the real shit was coming soon
And Stevie Wonder song the tune I heard it backwards
(Erus Rof) closed my eyes and saw blackbirds
Eating on a dead raccoon
Started thinking back when I was scared to say bad words
Before for the internet making up Facebook passwords
I see Casper floating in my room
When I pray maybe I should come down and pray afterwords
People kill deer for their antlers
I didn't really wanna pet one
I didn't really wanna let one live
On some futuristic shit like a Jetsons
Yes man flirting with my home boy's step mom
Thumbin' through my pop's old record collection
Take a sniff then I drift into depth with my headphones
Staying on the floor in the restroom yes I'm

[Hook: Rittz] (2X)
Looking at the world with my eye lids shut
We give it all to live but when we die then what
My high's electrifying like the lightning struck
I look up in the sky and hope that I end up
In heaven, heaven

[Verse 2: Yelawolf]
You motherfuckers, hey
Hey, pass me the squeegee (Somebody threw up)
I’m about sick of you and Newport doin' coke (On my bus)
A‘ight, Newport ain’t doin’ coke but (You are) and (So far)
You done brought 2 hoes backstage (The the the Sammy Hagar)
You told me 3 hoes was Dio cause they was (Headbanging)
Or you could be certain that the meat curtains (Was hanging)
Hey let me get another shot of Jack (FUCK YOU!)
What?! Oh you drank it all (FUCK YOU!)
Fuck it where's the Canadian mist
Now I'm on some plastic bottle drinking shit
And my tour manager's looking for somewhere to sink his dick
(Brooklyn!) Represent, represent-sent
Tribe called meth, represent, represent-sent
The bottle ain't girl for queen queen
Two bottles of ways to swim badadduuu duduuu
And I mean that from the bottom of my nuts
3 more shots of moonshine I do fine, I
