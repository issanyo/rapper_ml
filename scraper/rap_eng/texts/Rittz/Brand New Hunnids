[Hook: Frizz]
Ay, ay
I'ma keep it real like a brand new hunnid
Ay
'Bout that life, I ain't ever ran from it
Ay
Everywhere I go I try to get to the money
Ay
Everywhere I go I try to get to the money

[Verse 1: Rittz]
I've been feeling like Pablo in the Wells Fargo
I ain't here to talk about a car loan
Pockets on my cargo shorts full of money
And a duffel bag stuffed full, hard to keep the zipper on the top closed
You can barely pay a car note
Why you mad at me because your credit score low?
I done gone broke but I bounced back
Leaning on the counter while she look at my account
Can I have a lollipop though?
Runnin' game flirtin', with the bank teller
I can tell she thinking I'm a cocaine dealer
I got cash 'cause I rap, I don't trap
I was hurting when I didn't have money, now the paper like a painkiller
The Internet say I'm worth four mil'
It used to be a way worse ordeal
No more Dollar Menu orders, eating four course meals
Thought I was a winner, look at what the scoreboard said
Forrest Gump in the end zone and kept running
On the way to make a milli you can bet on me
You sitting still like a crash test dummy
Like you got a check coming
Tryna flash, you ain't got Tech money
You ain't ever live lavish, tryna be Travis
You ain't ever built like that
You been living in a fantasy knowing that you can't achieve
I'ma tell you real life fast
Keep it real like that
Yeah

[Hook: Frizz]
I'ma keep it real like a brand new hunnid
Ay
'Bout that life, I ain't never ran from it
Ay
Everywhere I go I try to get to the money
Ay, ay
Everywhere I go I try to get to the money
Ay
I'ma keep it real like a brand new hunnid
Ay
'Bout that life, I ain't never ran from it
Ay
Everywhere I go I try to get to the money
Ay
Everywhere I go I try to get to the money

[Verse 2: Tech N9ne]
Get some big ones, shit comes, quick son ditch 'em
'Cause they gonna get to begging from the rich one
For the money for tummy, booty, and they tits done
Cross yo neck with a razor
For the fetty when they see you livin' major
How they comin' for money ya job paid ya
When not even one of them did a little bit of labor
With them brand new hunnids
Damn you done it
Not a way somebody can ever ban you from it
How can you stomach
The poverty I hit the lottery
So when you go in the pile can you plummet
Damn you stuntin'
On the land when you expand the grands
They gonna stand who run it and the jam you brung it
Comin' from all the fans the Kansas City man do gun it
Take all the paper don't let the paper take ya
Big money maker you're gonna wait to vapor
From all the haters they wanna waste ya
Like a trip when they hit a gallon of Jäger
Off with the money is why they shoot ya
'Cause they jealous they makin' the shotty juice ya
I ain't slippin' or givin' nobody boosters
I keep the brim a hunnid 'cause Tech is a crowded poosta
Nigga, ay

[Hook: Frizz]
I'ma keep it real like a brand new hunnid
Ay
'Bout that life, I ain't never ran from it
Ay
Everywhere I go I try to get to the money
Ay, ay
Everywhere I go I try to get to the money
Ay
I'ma keep it real like a brand new hunnid
Ay
'Bout that life, I ain't never ran from it
Ay
Everywhere I go I try to get to the money
Ay
Everywhere I go I try to get to the money

[Verse 3: JL]
Like a brand new hunnid dollar bill
When they put the light to me they will know that I'm real
I'ma get to the money
But I give 'em what they can build in it
Rock at the rigorous on the go without a chill
We two up, it's too much money to be made
Too much money for me to ever be a slave
Too much money for me to not wanna get out of the bed and go get it
Somebody already gettin' paid
It don't matter if you rappin' or thuggin', be stackin' or pluggin'
It’s either you are slackin' or pumpin', how bad do you want it?
Look even if you hover at the oven and you wrapping a couple of 'em
Moving two by fours like Jim Duggan, you buggin'
If you don't got the lucrative hustle
Looking for loot producing part of productive 'cause you
Gotta be tough and plus you gotta do what you must do
Throw it when you win, they will son the rustle
But I see hawks when I see these thots, and I read thoughts
Let them wonder ‘bout the bread
He financially flaunts 'cause he know what she wants
Let alone fucks I give 'em the photo cred
Even though I do collect the dough, I haven't changed yet
Never quit, never sit waiting for a paycheck
To the paid jet, then get lifted like a weight set
With a loud pack, hit a chronic like a Dre set
Jay high that's a safe bet

[Hook: Frizz]
I'ma keep it real like a brand new hunnid
Ay
'Bout that life, I ain't never ran from it
Ay
Everywhere I go I try to get to the money
Ay, ay
Everywhere I go I try to get to the money
Ay
I'ma keep it real like a brand new hunnid
Ay
'Bout that life, I ain't never ran from it
Ay
Everywhere I go I try to get to the money
Ay
Everywhere I go I try to get to the money
