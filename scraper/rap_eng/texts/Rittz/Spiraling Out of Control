[Verse 1]
Global warming, hot all year long
Minimum wage ain't enough income
Make America great again, and trust in Trump
I been looking at the country like what the fuck went wrong
Why the fuck is the water in Flint, Michigan brown?
But instead of investing government spending tryna fix it
They gon' build a wall fit to keep illegal immigrants out
Feeling like it's game over but the ball's in bounds
We the bomb, we the controversy and conflict
Trump went and fired the head of the FBI
Must advance corruption with our Russia friends
It's like an episode of Spy Vs. Spy
Your god verse mine, the religious beliefs to keep us all divided
I don't care what god you praise
I'm just lucky I'm not stuck in the streets ,starving and naked Through the garbage try'na salvage all the stuff we waste
Feel like Judgment Day might be right around the corner
Water drying up around the world, supply run short
Scientists try to vision life on Mars
More wars make us wanna go and buy more guns
Had one epidemic at the methadone clinic
Your friend or your family member got the zombie face
Our military still at war while we calm and safe
From the Islamic state ,they screaming bombs away
I pray

[Hook]
I don't know how long we got left 'cause God only knows
I think the whole world is spiraling out of control
Take off my blindfold, my eyes open, I don't see hope
I think the whole world is spiraling out of control

[Verse 2]
First of all, Trump sucks
Let me say it just so I can set the record straight
If that don't make you wanna listen to my record, great
I mean he's funny for a guy with some money
On the news he's entertaining, as a president elect, he ain't
You feel strong about your views, that's cool
Me and you can just agree to disagree
You win, I lose, I'm just voicing my opinion
While I listen to him trying to convince me, saying it is fate
Fake news, fake shoes, fake ass, fake boobs
Fake ass, fake dudes, fake cash, fake nudes
Wait a minute, that was real, Caitlyn Jenner got a pussy?
Now it's hard to see the picture straight
He's fake too, fake proof, fake jewels, fake shoes
Waste spools, wait dude, you ain't gotta fuck
You can shoot it in a cup
You could have a son or a daughter, artificially inseminate
I ain't got a problem with that, or the sexual partners you have
They say to go behind closed doors
I say fuck it, make it a public display
What you choose to do with your body is up to you, I'm prochoice
We got bigger problems to handle, preventing world wars
North Korea with their bombs, showing off in a parade
That's been going on for years, back and forth, it's a game
They improving the nuclear reign so I pray 'cause

[Hook]
I don't know how long we got left 'cause God only knows
I think the whole world is spiraling out of control
Take off my blindfold, my eyes open, I don't see hope
I think the whole world is spiraling out of control

[Verse 3]
Watching Worldstar, god not again
Another kid shot on a cop's bodycam
Cops got a hard job, could somebody
Not invent a weapon that'll drop a person without causing death?
That's a thought, later on put my phone away
But all the images I've watched are popping up inside my head
Kids knocked out cold, fist fights, air strikes
Rats eating dead mice, someone lost a leg
Lot of kids watching vids that I did
When they put a kitten in a microwave, parents act shocked
Give 'em iPads, pay 'em no attention, no adult restriction
Then you wonder why they having bad thoughts
Got the hammer cocked back on their dad's gun
One mistake and they gon have to say bye world
Was everybody so surprised
Almost every girl in my school acting like the cash me outside girl
How 'bout that?
Young and begging to get pregnant
They were skinny saying now I'm fat
Download apps and still take selfies of themselves
Really selfish they baby daddy bounced
They kid ain't got no dad
But her momma love the drama 'cause it's all she had
She be smoking while the baby in the car seat strapped
Social workers came and got him
Now he's someone else's problem
Looking in the crystal ball, to me it all seems bad
But really

[Hook]
I don't know how long we got left 'cause God only knows
I think the whole world is spiraling out of control
Take off my blindfold, my eyes open, I don't see hope
I think the whole world is spiraling out of control
