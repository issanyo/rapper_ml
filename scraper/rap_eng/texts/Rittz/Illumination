[Intro]
It's Rittz, bitch

[Verse 1]
I can hear the DJ play my first song
I can hear the crowd is loud and intense
Screamin', I can feel that love
So come refill my cup
Because the pill I took just kicked in
When the curtain opens up I can smell the fire
All I see is the smoke and the eyes of my fans
Light the pipe when they recite my words and when it flies at first
I feel the goosebumps rise on my skin
'Cause the music gave us something in common we all feel
Now we get together up under the same roof
Let them bring upon the TNT
We screamin' CNT
Until the E-N-D
We can't lose
With the movement of muscle and scrubble of bamboo
Salute from the back of the bar to the front row
Bartender said they got no Crown because it got sold out
That's what the fuck goes down at my show
And somebody threw an 8-ball on the stage
Put it in my pocket, if I just flew
I'ma straight chug another bottle
When I vibrate out I take Tums, I won't stop it 'cause
'Cause the vibe right now is great
I don't want no problem
Busting bright lights off my chain
Watchin my medallion
When the crowd shouts out my name
I'ma take a bow when they cry out loud , my king
I just feel empowered
Put you lighters and your phone up in the sky, wave 'em 'round as

[Hook]
We illuminate the night
We illuminate the night
We illuminate the night
We illuminate the night
It's CNT and we illuminate the night
We illuminate the night
We illuminate the night
We illuminate the night
It's illumination
Taking over
Through the nation
Made it global
It's illumination
Made 'em notice
Jubilation
Can't control it

[Verse 2]
People told me that they made a mistake and judged a book by its cover
When they discovered my music but that don't make any sense
If you got a glimpse of me and you can see I'm a player illuminating
Then you basically as lame as it get
Probably wouldn't relate to me if you made an attempt
Customizing all my sneakers and I lace 'em with gems
Blinded by my diamond ring, I think it's making them squint
Take an average day and make it an event, lady and gents
It's the white boy that they call Rittz
Throw the middle finger up like, what's good?
CNT and we don't fuck with y'all bitch
Lace the Crown with the Xanax bars we crushed up
I don't get a lot of promised economy, rappers, see 'em and I laugh
Commenting constantly tryna see if I react
All my followers calling me, I'ma lead 'em down a path
We got problems in common, so I'ma speak on their behalf
'Cause they said I'd never win, I was called a loser
By my ex girlfriend, I bet she feel kinda stupid
But I just go cash my check, I been moving units
All my fake ass friends I had, throwing up the deuces
The mistakes I made have past, looking at the future
So I pray and raise my glass, straight up when I shoot it
But I owe it all to you because the music is a movement
And we glowing like the ring around the moon this is

[Hook]
It's illumination
Taking over
Through the nation
Made it global
It's illumination
Made 'em notice
Jubilation
Can't control it
I'm seekin' to illuminate the night
We illuminate the night
We illuminate the night
We illuminate the night
Strange Music
We illuminate the night
We illuminate the night
We illuminate the night
We illuminate the night
