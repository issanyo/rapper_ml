(Intro)
(Phone Rings)
Pick up the fuckin' phone, pick up the goddamn phone
Ah fuck, oh goddammit
Baby if you get this call me back immediately this is a fuckin' emergency
I, I think I did too much shit my fuckin' heart feels like it's about to shut down
So call me back, quick as fuck please. Bye

(Verse 1)
Cocaine in my nostril hair
White lines chopped up on a cloudy mirror
Heart beat tellin’ me to slow it down
I ain't listenin’ and I can hear it loud n’ clear
My ribcage’s clinchin’ I’m pourin’ sweat
Still tryna snort lookin’ for a drip
Trippin’ out knowin’ I did too much
Havin’ a panic attack I feel short of breath
I shut the bathroom door n’ wet my face hopin’ that the water might cool me off
Tryna throw up in the toilet to get it out my system my nose started pourin’ blood
And that made it worse, the blood stained my shirt, im contemplatin’ wakin’ my parents up
Tellin’ the truth I’m overdosin’ on coke but maybe it’ll go away I’m just paranoid
I went back in the room and I shut the door
Got some Xanax to the dresser drawer
Here I go again mixin’ uppers and downers the sound of my heart like a tug o’ war
Cause all I heard as I laid in bed “please God lemme live I promise I will never do drugs no more”
Closed my eyes an realized that I wasn’t sure
I calmed down and I snorted more like goddamn

(Hook)
Now I lay me down to sleep
I pray the Lord my soul to keep
But if I die before I wake
I pray the Lord my soul to take
Amen, Amen, Amen, Amen
Let me see another day again

(Verse 2)
Holes in the gloves of the homeless man
Freezin’ as bad as the cold cement
On the corner beggin’ with an open hand
The weather man said it’s probably gunna snow again
There more holes in his clothes that expose his skin
Sick with pneumonia he’s old an slim
Hopin’ when somebody walks by and sees him freezing they may throw him a coat
The wind is unbearable, he hasn’t ate in days
Diggin’ through the trash find a burger that’s halfway eaten some packets a mayonnaise
Beggin’ all day nobody gave em change
He just lays in waste below the underpass
Last year he done almost froze to death
But this winter is much colder
The homeless shelter too full now there’s no one left to come rescue him
He’s outta breath they can’t give him a second wind the snowfall arrives
Prayin’ out loud “please God I apologize for anything I done wrong” he cried
He can’t feel his fingers his legs is numb
But everyone else is at home warm inside
He’s up under the bridge bout to freeze to death
Singin' to God I don’t wanna die like dear Lord

(Hook)

(Verse 3)
Life of her was so promising
Popular, a homecoming queen
Dreamed a becoming a doctor one day
She’s smart so her grades were astonishing
Her boyfriend gave her a promise ring
It was a prime example of puppy love
They act as if they was attached at the hip
Every time you saw one they was coupled up
Neither one of them drunk that much
But one night they got the invite to go n‘ drink with friends
It was started out to be a normal night
But change the course her life and have a tragic end
And then 10 shots later said they had to leave
Her friend said stay you okay to drive?
One of the dudes tried to take her keys
She said please you’re trippin’ I’m okay I’m fine
She got behind the wheel her boyfriend was trashed
On the highway goin’ way to fast
Hit a sharp corner round a bend and crashed
Her boyfriend’s head went through the windshield pass
Her neck gashed wide open her ribs are broken her boyfriend’s gone in the car he died
She hangin’ on waitin’ for the Jaws of Life to get her out
And she started to shut her eyes and she said God

(Hook)
