[Intro]
Ye-uh-ye-uh-ye-uh-yeah
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, R-I-T-T-Z bitch!

[Verse 1]
Starry night when I'm riding
I'm a modern-day Van Gogh
Luchini falling from the sky
Coolie High like I'm Camp Lo
My music beating so loud
No wonder why my last amp broke
Them Rockford Fosgates knocking my drop
Might rock that lamp post
Got powder all in my beard
I ain't been eating no french toast
I finally got a little bread
Went from a Kimbo Slice to a French loaf
Success done went to my head
I just spend more on my dress code
The Clintel is my team
I play point and I'm the head coach
It's Rittz, bitch!

[Hook]
My future lookin' so bright
I ain't sweating my past now
I've been working all night
I finish up and I cash out
Fly away and get high
Take shots of Crown 'til I pass out
Ain't no stealing my spotlight
They can play the background
There ain't no lookin' back now
Nooo-ooo, R-I-T-T-Z bitch!

[Verse 2]
I wanted to throw in the towel
I came so far that I can't quit
I have to say it feels great to finally see a hundred K on my bank slip
These hoes, they wanna strip down
But I got prior engagements
My lady's laying on the bed my leg in her ear, my hand on her anklet
She loved me when I was a bum
But I got a deal, I'm still letting it sink in
It's Monday morning, I'm home and I feel liberated like Big and Dre did
It's cool to rep for your town
Still, at the end of the day you gotta think rich
Still cruising on Crews road, gold flexin' my candy paint drip
Like yeah
People walk up on me in the liquor store they wanna take a pic
I can hear them arguing up in the aisle right beside me
Saying, "Is it really him?" and I promise you it is
I got time to shoot the shit
Even if they gonna talk on me to death
Told me he got Jonny Valiant and it never left the deck
Til he got Next to Nothing, so yo when's that new shit coming
Here it is
Ye-uh-ye-uh-ye-uh-yeah

Clintel in this bitch like

[Hook]
My future lookin' so bright
I ain't sweating my past now
I've been working all night
I finish up and I cash out
Fly away and get high
Take shots of Crown 'til I pass out
Ain't no stealing my spotlight
They can play the background
There ain't no lookin' back now
Nooo-ooo, R-I-T-T-Z bitch!
