Questions 2012 - Rittz - Lyrics

Jyeah
(This rap shits crazy man)
2012
(People be asking me all kinds of crazy shit like, Who you gone sign with dog?)
Jyeah
Yeah
(Can you do a track for free?)

People ask me questions
When were you gonna get a mill?
You blowing up Rittz
Tell me how the fuck I feel
You was on a song with Yelawolf, right?
Did you sign to Interscope?
Were you tryna get a record deal?
Why you sitting still?
You ain’t puttin' on nothing new
In a minute, but fuck it truthfully
I've yet to hear
You come wack on the track
Matter of fact, I hit your manager up about a feature
You ever check your mail?
You be on Twitter still?
I think I messaged you a couple days ago
You ain’t responded yet
You snapped on a Krizz Kaliko record
You ever think you gonna get to do a song with Tech?
You really snort coke like you say you do in your record?
If so then let me know because I got the soft on deck
I thought you would suck when I first saw you
Then I listened to you I was shocked, much respect
I really thought you was black
When I heard you on Box Chevy
Really I never checked on it to see who you was
I see you on tour with Wolf now
Do you think could sign this?
You think that we could speak on the bus?
Can I bust a freestyle for you
Me and you are just alike listen to me I rap fast like you
Me and my homeboy got some produced beats
I think that you would like some of the track we do
You wanna shot? You wanna bump?
You wanna smoke? You want some hoes?
I got a bitch that'll give us all head in a hotel room
You wanna go?
Does your girl really trip on you when you be on the road?
Is she the one you talk about in “Sleep At Night”?
Is that her in the video?
Nah dummy that's an actress
My real girlfriend at home pissed
Cause she on Facebook and saw me take a picture with a fat bitch
What you like fat chicks? You like black chicks?
Why you so pussy whipped I never see you mack chicks
I don't rap to get the women
I just want a wife, and a normal life one day
I never had shit
Last year I was cooking in the kitchen
One night I made Toni Braxton a piece of catfish
Getting off work sweating, changing my clothes
Goin' to a show wearing Gold
Frontin' like I had bread
Limping on my last leg
But you got bread now right?
Can you hook me up with a job?
You never wanna pick up when I call
All my homies looking at me like they got some on the prob
But where your hair at dog?
I hope you ain't cut it off
I play your music all the time, my homies say you're the shit
Besides Eminem, them, him and him
I swear to God you are the best
I said nah, I'm next
