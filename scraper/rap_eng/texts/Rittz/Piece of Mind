[Intro]

[Hook x2]
Piece of mind
Life on the streets of crime
Violence and people dying
It’s the blind trynna lead the blind
We can't leave this life that we lead behind
We trynna find some

[Verse 1 : Rittz]
Ain't no peace in the Peach state
Most of us totin' a loaded weapon
And children get exposed
When they grow and they show aggression
And hate
Their parents never took a second to take
A look and make sure the direction
That they were headed was straight
In tenth grade my friend tate was alive
Fresh outta middle school
They stabbed him in front of an arcade and he died
Over Cambodian gang tats
Eroded the brain back
Memories of his funeral
The moments of pain that
I endured as a teen
I done seen my fair share of scares
My crew and I went everywhere prepared
Because ?I'm harmless?
The calm side of life had been tarnished
One of my best friends took a knife in the armpit
For winning a fist fight
9 years later I still pray to god
Thanking him for letting him live life
The damage was done
Same night, people came to rush my crib
He came to fight em' with his bandages on
Cause there ain't no mother fuckin peace

[Hook x2]

[Verse 2 : Rittz]

Man Atlanta ain't as peaceful
As the people would think
Everybody's mind ain't equally synched
My homie "hoodlum" 15 got arrested for robbin
An adolescent they kept him inside corrections
Now he’s legal to drink
Sure you heard the same story before
Just cause mine's recorded
It ain't any more important than yours
It's all distorted
Were easily influence by money, power, respect
Nobody wants to work for hours and sweat
Specially when their parent’s struggle
And they house is a wreck
Every other kid around
Is getting down with a set
When I was young I was ?focused?
Down with the crips or the bloods
If not your crew was probably
Hittin liqs and the drugs
My homie "slick" used to show me the ropes
The dos and dont's of the streets
My homie Charles made the both of us meet
Now im his daughters godfather with pride
Can't forget the day in '99 he cried
Told me Charles had died
Cause ain't no mother fuckin peace

[Hook x2]

[Verse 3: Rittz]

Everybody wanna rep with the tough guy
What goes around comes around
You better be expecting some gunfire
Trynna mature trynna ignore
The drama cause kharma been harmin'
Been leaving dad and momma to mourn
There will always be more problems
Try to handle 'em safely
I don’t want to end up in the ambulance racing
With my family waiting in the emergency room
Alotta prison facing death
Convicted murderer doom
Say goodbye to the hot sun
My boy black told me get burnt
He caught a couple bullet shots from the shotgun
Hit is bicep instead of his chest
Coulda bled to his death
He wasn’t ready yet
I guess he was blessed
I thank the lord that Im here
Lookin forward to livin
Instead of being someone
People find important or fear
Maybe then a little peace
Will be in Georgia
Or near your part of town
My eyes are watered down
Pourin with tears
I need peace
