These motherfuckers make me laugh
They L-A-F, they Lame As Fuck
Look at how they dress
They L-A-F, they Lame As Fuck
Listen how they rap
They L-A-F, they Lame As Fuck
Trying to say they fresh, trying to say they tough
You ain't ever been about it, you just make shit up
You lame as fuck

[Verse 1]
You ain't spittin' and your music don't jam
Try to study me like I'm a student exam
Hard for me to take a lyricist serious
Especially a dude in sweatpants wearing unisex Vans
What was you expecting, made a song 'Fuck Swag' and
Ain't nobody say shit, I guess they afraid if
They get out of line I'm 'bout to have to grave dig
A great big hole, kill him, leave them where you lay bitch
A.K.A Mr. Make-'em-Wanna-Rewrite
I guess I'm the one they want to be like
These guys get a feature from me study me on every record
Then they switch they whole style up
Homie I can see right through it
You ain't never used to chop like that
Now you talk about your girl and your struggle
Tryin' to get it, how you did a lot of soft
How you're pissed off at your boss
You ain't used to have the same 9 to 5 I had
Need to find your own lane, you and I might crash
Get in mine, hope you had a good time, (I'm back)
Rap game looking like Revenge of the Nerds
And ya pants and ya shirt too tight, is that plaid?
We ain't seeing eye to eye like I have an eye patch
No class having motherfucker you can die
You gone wish you had a life raft
My style is hijacked, did I kill him, my bad

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
With your lame ass socks showing, stop trolling
Going online posing with your Glock showing
You ain't never shot no one, stop lying you are not blowing
Trying to copy me, you thinking I would not notice
Cockroaches couldn't see me like they got some glaucoma
Comment under my photos bout the way that I look
I bet that I could get your lady to fuck
And suck dick, quicker than you
You said the two of you was in love
You're lame as fuck and I bet that you the type of dude to come up
And tell me that I look familiar, knowing damn well ya
Seen my videos and know my name and it would kill ya
Not to be lame so instead I gotta tell ya
Washed up rappers acting like I owe 'em something
When I needed them before I made it, they would never help ya
Lame ass homies wanna party at my crib
So they can drink up all my liquor they don’t ever buy they-self none
They say they recording, you ain’t got songs
Tryna say you performing, you ain’t got fans
But it’s hard to ignore 'em, lame motherfucker
Probably like, foam-a-sites, always rockin’ team Jordans
Lame ass bitches insecure and distorted
She tried shave her head on some Cassie shit
Now she thinkin’ she gorgeous
Never keeps a boyfriend, she fucking everybody, little nasty bitch
A lot of people in my city try to say that they relate to me
But still so many in Atlanta don’t appreciate a thing
I did or even heard of me
Its almost like they trained to be a slave to what they playin’ on the radio
They proceed to put me in a cage because my record label Strange
They need to listen, if they did they'd probably end up devastated
We don’t play, we put the music business in a Strangeulation
Other record labels lame to me, these motherfuckers L-A-F
Actin’ hard, never take a day off (they L-A-F)
Still rappin’, shit'll never pay off (they L-A-F)
Still trappin’ acting like a straight boss (they L-A-F)
Get arrested, they confessing, they decide to play ball (they L-A-F)
They be actin’ like we cooler than we are
If I met you doing music, don’t be stupid, this a job
You are not a friend of mine, just a dude I never call
Bombing on 'em, Shock and Awe
