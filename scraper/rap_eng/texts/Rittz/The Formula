[Intro]
Yeah
Nobody fucking with us
Rittz up in this bitch, when I spit I'm a warrior
Still got that Crown Royal in my cup, 'bout to pour it up
Biggest independent in the game, if you lame we're ignorin' ya
Everytime I get with Tech on a track it's historical
You better warn these hoes, I said...

[Hook]
Watch out for your spot, here I come, I'm warning ya
They said that I'm hot, really I was just warming up
Haters wanna see me flop, I’m outperforming 'em
Everywhere we go people point at us
They wanna join us 'cause we making noise
We was born with the formula
Strange Music got the formula
Tech N9na got the formula
White Jesus got the formula
People wanna point at us
They wanna join us 'cause we making noise
We was born with the formula

[Verse 1: Rittz]
From Atlanta to the MO
From the second that I connected with Tech I set the precedents
Killin' a beat for Seven's effortless
Rappers stressing us, so what’s or who it do
You know who coming neck to neck with us
Nobody - I'm just resurrecting Keith Sweat for the heck of it
Sometimes I hate my aggression it gets the best of me
Like I was possessed and I need the exorcist
Until they hear me I keep rushin' up the field like Emmitt Smith
Cocky like a boxing champ
Do excuse me 'cause my mind is kinda like a lava lamp
Savage like I'm Macho Man
Go induce a logo on the side of my Versace lens
Thinking like I should be singing in a Mariachi band
Hola, que pasa guey?
You should really watch the way you stepping to me
Fuck around and now you lost a leg
And now you look like Drake in his Degrassi days
Crippled, lame as fuck, and it ain't tough for me to spot a rotten egg
Had to squash you, homie, I'm a giant, I'm colossal
You a cartoon drawer, motherfucker I'm Picasso
I just need a Xannie bar, a couple shots inside my nostril
When I'm Michael coming harder than Lamar inside a brothel
Fuck a rapper, I would rather be compared to Aristotle, where the bottle?
Simply miss, another Caribou, where the Lou?
Pussy fronting with a gun they scared of you, scared of who?
Somebody better go and let them know that what they better do is

[Hook]
Watch out for your spot, here I come, I'm warning ya
They said that I'm hot, really I was just warming up
Haters wanna see me flop, I’m outperforming 'em
Everywhere we go people point at us
They wanna join us 'cause we making noise
We was born with the formula
Strange Music got the formula
Tech N9na got the formula
White Jesus got the formula
People wanna point at us
They wanna join us 'cause we making noise
We was born with the formula

[Verse 2: Tech N9ne]
Pop pop pop pop off at the mouth
How I do it so fluid spew it, never soft as a mouse
Sick as sewage, I grew it too, it’s coolest talk at the house
Missou is the truest, you is foolish, flossin' about
Bickin' it back and I’m bein' a better one, somethin' better was never done
If you win-win this cheddarrun you really better go get a gun
Yes, I’m packin' the potion that’s never lackin' promotion
Have you stackin' and toastin' 'cause now you rappin' and grossin'
People set in they sin, 'bout the bread I’m makin'
That I made and never gave it yo where the heck is they been?
Said the label ain't charitable, gonna be checkin' they chin
The second they grin you really want it step and say when
But I’m in Monaco, on a boat, puffin' that chronicle
Dishonorable when they hate the Snake and Bat logo upon the coat
So if they wanna mope and leave us you can bet I'ma vote
Gassin' like Conoco and killin' 'em off is comical
You should prolly think about it 'fore you get up and you
Doubt it 'bout the pen game, definitely insane
I will become the in thing, music will then change
Take your family and friends brain, now they within Strange
The formula
Rittz got it to a T that’s why we gettin' the sound spread around now
With Tecca N9na right beside 'em you know it be goin' down diggy-down diggy-down-down!

[Hook]
Watch out for your spot, here I come, I'm warning ya
They said that I'm hot, really I was just warming up
Haters wanna see me flop, I’m outperforming 'em
Everywhere we go people point at us
They wanna join us 'cause we making noise
We was born with the formula

[Verse 3: Krizz Kaliko]
Yes sir
Kali put the rocket in the pocket and the feet upon the dresser
At first, so dope she wanna off the God, I'm guessin' I'm a bless 'er
Jonny and Donnie, we get money, no Illuminati
We show at the party, you feel like it? Let us in yo body
Oddity, how did he make 'em a commodity?
Hardly handle the bussin' it's a part of me
I feel like we're picking on other rappers and labels
They ain't sitting at the table with us, able as us
Maybe they division is 'cause they lacking in paper and we pay bills
What happened to some cray deals
Snake and the Bat, we lackin' on nuttin, we'd be gauge strapped
Sayin' that rap it ain't 'bout nothin', they be frontin' frontin'
Takin' 'em back to putting paper in people's hands
So fecal on evil people, I'm making all the people dance
I know there'll be a lot of handgrabbin' and man baggin'
Even if they pants saggin' they be damn faggots
I'ma stay in creased khakis with a tan jacket
They can stand back 'cause Sam going ham sandwich
Bringing the same same mainstream game to the Strange team game 'cause the people really borin' ya
When we chop, it's kinda hard to understand we be
Speaking like a foreigner, maybe it's the formula

[Hook]
Watch out for your spot, here I come, I'm warning ya
They said that I'm hot, really I was just warming up
Haters wanna see me flop, I’m outperforming 'em
Everywhere we go people point at us
They wanna join us 'cause we making noise
We were born with the formula
