(Verse 1)
Summertime riding on Sugarloaf
Group of people trying to flag me down and beep their horn
Yelling out the window at me saying "Rittz Bitch!"
"We proud of you Homie, keep it going!"
And my reaction?
I was smiling ear to ear
Off in Sugarloaf Mills shoppin off in Manhattan
Fans asking me shit while I'm picking out clothes
Used to wish that I'd be famous for this rappin then it happened
Homie said I'm snapping I dapped him up
Took a pic for Instagram in Sunglasses Hut
I told him "Post it up and tag me bruh
I follow back, spread the word"
I don't ask for much and that's some real shit
One of my friends said "Does that get hard to deal with?"
Fuck no man I'm hoping that I still get
Love five years down the road from now or when it's over
I'm about to soak it up until then
People staring at me in the restaurant
On the days I want ‘em to nobody notice me
But when I'm in my comfy clothes and leave the house
Someone's gonna know it's me and come approach
I see a kid walking to my table
My girlfriend said fuck she ain't trying to be ungrateful
She just hates that she can't leave the house without makeup
People post shit on Facebook and end up saying something hateful
Homie wasn't trying to take a pic of us
He said I can't believe it's you I keep up with your stuff
You music got me through a stint in rehab and a bad breakup I relate so much
You're blowing up now
He said it's got to feel great that your paid and you made it
I bet your life changed a bunch
I told him everything’s great I done made a little name
Maybe one day the pay will come but I'm

(Hook)
Broke and famous
Taking pics with total strangers
When you're broke and famous
Everyone knows what your name is
When you're broke and famous
Kinda feels like I done made it
Still I'm broke and famous
Broke and famous

(Verse 2)
I just made it down to South by Southwest
And hollered at the league of extraordinary G'z
Me and Gabo out there kicking it
Took a picture with the kid he told me keep it Strange
And then he asked me is my album out yet
What? I said yeah motherfucker
Jonny Valiant drop last year, fuck you been?
And then I realized
Just because people recognize you don't mean they bump your shit
But some people think I done struck it rich
Because my shit is in the stores
And I did a lot of tours
And they seen me in the cypher on the BET awards
I figured I'd get 100,000 Twitter followers, that was that
I didn't, I'm not complaining this is all fact
Taking flights to LA and New York
Doing radio interviews
Opening huge doors
Money spent is towards your budget
You ate good for a minute
It's finished and now you got to pay it all back
When I get frustrated gotta fallback
And recall back
When I called that number for le Cordon Bleu
I got to study for my GED
I'm broke as fuck and need a job bad
Fast forward to now my bank account ain’t huge
But this is a decent way to live
I get to do my dream job
Homie working at the wing spot asking me to take a pic cause I'm
