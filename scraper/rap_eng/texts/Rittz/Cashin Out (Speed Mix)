[Intro: Ca$h Out & Rittz]
(I ride around with that nina)
(You know we smokin' on Keisha)
(Hi, can I?)
Hold up! (yeah yeah yeah)
This the muthafuckin' SpeedMix
Let's snort a line

[Hook]
Puttin' shit up my nose, I'm choppin' up that Christina
(I be on that white)
If I'm not on no blow then I'm prolly geeked up on Tina
(snortin' on that ice)
I was hooked on pills so I had to switch my routine up
(I be on them bumps)
Now I'll never let myself go down I don't wanna start fiendin'
(I don't wanna start fiendin')
Snortin' lines of dope off my CD case that I pass around
(I snort that line)
Got a dollar bill in my nostril still and I'm passin' out
(Got a dollar bills yo)
Puttin' shit up my nose, I'm choppin' up that Christina
(I be on that soft)
If I'm not on no blow then I'm prolly geeked up on Tina

[Verse 1]
I be paranoid, ridin' with the nina
Geekin' on Christina
Crushin' up the Tina, crystal clear as Aquafina
Got a mirror or magazine or somethin' hard
So I can chop another line, take a sniff
Heartbeat will start to speed up
I'm an animal, a cheetah
People say that I'm a piece
Of shit 'cause I sniff Methamphetamine
And beat 'em in the mornin' while you sleepin'
I ain't never been a dreamer, I be paranoid
And peekin' out the window like a tweaker
I need a Xanax, damn this
Damn my whole esophagus, it was fucked so I stopped
Now I'm doin' soft again
When they said they was comin'
I said I was out, 30 minutes later
I was crushin' it and choppin' it
Always had a problem with suckin' on the coke or the ice, clit dope
Call it white man crack
Now I'm layin' in my bed
Geeked up in the dark
Choppin' out lines by the night stand lamp

[Hook]
Puttin' shit up my nose, I'm choppin' up that Christina
(I be on that white)
If I'm not on no blow then I'm prolly geeked up on Tina
(snortin' on that ice)
I was hooked on pills so I had to switch my routine up
(I be on them bumps)
Now I'll never let myself go down I don't wanna start fiendin'
(I don't wanna start fiendin')
Snortin' lines of dope off my CD case that I pass around
(I snort that line)
Got a dollar bill in my nostril still and I'm passin' out
(Got a dollar bills yo)
Puttin' shit up my nose, I'm choppin' up that Christina
(I be on that soft)
If I'm not on no blow then I'm prolly geeked up on Tina


[Verse 2]
It's taboo to rap about snortin' shit
But it's cool to write a song about green and E?
Shit I been up so many days I think I'm seein' things
And every time I roll a blunt I add a sprinkle in
So go on and smoke 3 whole blunts
And fuck McDonald's, I don't need no lunch
No appetite, I snorted 3 more bumps
You think I'm bad off on the soft?
Gimme some speed and we gon' be awake for 3 whole months
Become paranoid, talkin' 'bout aliens and the government
Drawin' on the walls, fuck up, then tryin' to cover it
Gettin' too deep with hoes you barely know
Geeked, doin' freaky shit when you fuck 'em just for the fuck of it
So who the fuck you judgin', bitch?
Nose fucked up, got coke residue in my mustache
[?]
They can tell I'm geeked up
Fuck 'em, I'ma hit the bathroom
And do another key bump

[Hook Rittz]

(They call me Rittz)

[Outro: Rittz (rambling)]
I swear to god its like some Jedi shit like fuckin'
Id rather do speed than do coke 'cause like
I like coke but fuckin', I like I hate coke
But then like once you do coke
You wanna do some more coke
'Cause thats just the way coke is but
Like I would rather do speed and stay up 'cause
Like when I write dog I like write like
Fuckin 15 songs or some shit like that
You know what im sayin I get it in
Like this shit will burn the fuck out your nose
Tho thats the thing but my shits on fire right now
I mean im fucked up
Like I ain't been to sleep in like 3 fuckin days
But fuck dude I was like I got on the scale the other day
And I lost like 30 fuckin pounds
But I dont give a fuck tho man like
Shits been good man like
I like doin this shit like im feelin good like
Fuckin I dont even know what day it is
But shit its dope tho im writin
I been gettin beats done
I been gettin all kinds of shit done so
Fuck man if you got some fuck cut it out
You can do a bump
Or like smoke the shit eat the shit
Whatever you wanna do
Like my nose is fucked up like
Last month I had to eat the shit
This month im smokin shit and snortin shit
So like im all the way good
