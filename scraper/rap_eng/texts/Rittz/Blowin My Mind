I’m in my '87 Cutlass Supreme, looking clean
Smoking on that green while I lean
And the weed smoke is blowing my mind (my mind my mind)
And the swisher smoke is blowing my mind (my mind my mind)
You can find me riding 85 north for the A
Where the bitches fuck for riches and they see me getting paid
And the ladies they be blowing my mind (my mind my mind)
And these bitches they be blowing my mind (my mind my mind)
So now I’m

[Verse 1]
Shining like the North Star, see me out on Pleasant Hill
I may be out in Norcross, maybe up in Lawrenceville
Still really ain't no tellin' where the fuck you gonna see me
Maybe in Atlanta, see me partying on Beach Street
Looking Japanese cause I been smoking on that green green
Super clean clean, homie we be
Sniffing shit like porn stars, partying like animals
I drink then I pop more bars
At night I pop a couple Adderalls
All the bitches wanna get with this
I’m pimping and my day straight
Looking like she could have been a Playboy playmate
Fuck her to the rhythm of the 808 bass
See you take place up in my

[Verse 2]
Bumping DJ Burn One, looking like the white Dolemite
Got candy on the outside, but the leather in it’s cocaine white
My 15’s kicking down the street like it’s a stampede
Waving at some bitches that I seen up in the Grand Prix
Got to put some [?] on, I almost ran into a Camry
Goddamn she, looking fancy
Smelling like some pine trees, smoking with the windows up
The cops are right behind me, pull me over they gon' fine my buzz
So I hid it in my underwear, it’s reeking so much, still smell
Guess I’m paranoid cause I just seen 'em make a quick left
Accelerated on the pedal and I fishtailed
And I exhaled, up in my

[Verse 3]
Showing off, gold flakes in the paint job
I’m rolling like a bowling ball
Strike, knock em down, when they see me cruising
All you hear is "oohs" and “aww”s and “wow”s
I make motherfuckers bite like crocodiles
Go ahead jock my style
It’s all good, it’s impossible to be me
Jonny Valiant, white bitch with me got titties like Foxy Brown
So when they see me at the red light, you can see her head lights
I ain’t talking bout the European front four
Bout to take her home and beat the pussy up
I'mma hit it like a gong or conga, bongo
I done had my fun with you but now I got to run, ho
Back up in the Cutlass, so roll it up
Smoke another like a locomotive does
Pullin' up at the local pub
I’m in my... bitch... yeah
