[Intro:]
Ya-uh Yeah
Slum Shit
Yeah

[Verse 1:]
What you mean you don't like my shit?
Well, it's obvious that you don't have no taste and your opinions suck
And I don't expect to be everybody cup of tea
But don't act like I ain't killing everything I touch
I crush every record I'm on
So holla if you wanna get a feature while the price is right
See I try to be friendly, the MC's offend me
And now it's time for y'all to kiss the nice guy good bye
Besides, everyone hanging around me is a big shot
When is it appropriate for me to act like one?
I try to be humble among you motherfuckas
But some of you frontin' really lookin' mad I won
And done what I done already it's barely begun
It's scary cause everyone's wary and they say when I come
Wearin' my hair like it's hilarious tell me what's funny
They running when they see me drunk and my gun
Dumpin' they know they're gonna die...

[Hook:]
Die
Haters step aside, they wanna fuck with me
I swear to God, I’ll kill 'em 'til they show respect, or not
And everybody’s gonna
Die
Dead, shedding blood
I got the grave digger diggin' ya plot
I got ya body rottin' deep in the ground
Cause everybody gonna
Die

[Verse 2:]
I'm not used to this music shit
I guess that I'm cut from a different cloth
Photographers, bloggers, producer pricks
And musicians as a whole are starting to piss me off
Not all, just some of them rub me wrong
Is it possible that everyone's an entrepreneur?
Talking to you like they a Hollywood star
And you should be lucky that they even let you get your foot in the door
All I hear a ear full of manure
I don't know them much more
I can't ignore it, they just trying too hard
To be cool, and cuttin edge and wiggle they fucking dreads
I feel like I'm surrounded by dorks and corn balls galore
Does anybody know I'm up? I'm torn
I'm going off on 'em and I'm continuing the manure
Maybe I should have my boys tie 'em up with the phone cord
At gun point and tell em hit the floor
Cause everybody gon' die

[Hook:]

[Verse 3:]
It's Johnny Valiant: the head turner
I turned to a head hunter
I bet if I met - one of your girls I got head from her
And came on the bed comforter and she didn't swallow it
I zipped up my denims and then I gave her a fake number
And told her to "Hit me up, it's totally cool ho,"
My homie co-signed me so I came in and bull-dozed
My way in the industry any rapper offended
And wanna test me let me know I'll get to cover ya tombstone
I cock away all the way pull my weapon and draw
Homie by the way, I don't play, disrespect me I brawl
Take your life away by the way I'm as deadly as Saw
I'll prolly be a killer 'til I'm George Jefferson bald
Look at 'em all running for cover, they panicking
Frantically, they don't even stand a chance with me
My plan's to be famous and get a bad bitch
Maybe Casey Anthony'll marry me
Then everybody gone die
