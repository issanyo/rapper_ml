[Verse 1:]
Time to log on to Instagram
I'm busy but I gotta check it when I can
I'm bout to post up a pic again
I love to get positive comments from fans
But everyday someone starts bitchin' when
I don't accept or see the request they sent
They get upset feelin' like I rejected them
Impossible to talk to everyone that send DM's
But why you actin' like a bitch? Some dudes are hoes
Comments sayin' "Fuck you and the food you post!"
I hit em back, they retract everything they was sayin' like they was playin'
Homie I ain't in the mood for jokes
I'm not an actor rappin' in a movie bro
And I don't know you but know that you a douchey troll
With no do's or dont's
It's hard to recognize a face but I've seen some of you at shows
I'm lookin' at em like..

Is that that bitch?
That been talkin' shit online?
Is that that bitch?
That's been commenting all night?
Is that that bitch?
Mothafucka must've lost they mind
Thinkin' that you know me cuz of the internet but never met me in real life?
Cuz you don't know me bitch
You don't know me bitch
Hell nah you don't know me bitch
Is that that bitch?
You don't know me bitch
Hell nah you don't know me bitch
Is that that bitch?
You don't know me bitch
Hell nah you don't know me bitch
Is that that bitch?
Mothafucka must've lost they mind

[Verse 2]
Not a day goes by when someone ain't talkin' shit
They either brutally honest or the opposite
He said "He doesn't really feel my style, but you can rap good luck!"
That's a backward ass compliment
I can't respond to them I really want to snap
"Is it just me or does Rittz suck, he's wack"
It's like no wonder why my postures bad
Too many hatin' swinging on the only pair of nuts I have
So why the fuck you mad?
"I sent a track way back I was hopin' you could tell me what you think of it"
Man I think I get this once a week
Sendin' me a song for me to hear without a link to click
Irritated sayin, "How much for a feature Rittz?
You said it was a G on Basket Case"
It was a Grand back in 2011 and went for 3-5 now, I'm sorry you might have to save
It's funny people tellin' me what type of track to make
"You should do a song with him, put him on the end"
Namin' big name rappers that don't fit in my budget but they don't understand the biz they imagine it
On the real though If I could do a track with Drake or Kanye I would do the shit cuz I'm a fan
Made a joke and I post like I did and now my so called fans said they was unfollowin'
Like what's the problem dam?
"What you tryna go mainstream on us Rittz?
You supposed to keep it Strange"
My opinion is if you support a label that was underground then you should wanna seem em be the biggest name
Playin on the radio like every single day
Now where the real fans that be thinkin' out the box?
I show love for Jump St
These other punks need taught a lesson
When I see em I'ma cuss em out

[Verse 3]
Look I'm realistic
I know a lot of people don't think logistically before they go and type some shit
The internet makes everyone accessible
You can go and tell 'em what you didn't like or did
And you can get it off your mind, and vent
And feel like you lookin' someone eye to eye and spit
Like your opinion matters, at least it got you feeling like it did
But what's your name again? I forget
I'm looking at them like
