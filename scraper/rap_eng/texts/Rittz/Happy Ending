[Verse 1]
Feel like I got too much on my plate at once (plate at once, plate at once)
But I ain't got no place to run
Where do I draw the line cause I know I can't walk a straighter one (straighter one, straighter one)
Waiting on a chance to come
Only you can make a change cause you ain't getting waited on (waited on, waited on)
So really what you waiting on
Everyone that I hung around feeling bummed and they barely hanging from
A string believing in they faith in God
Blame it on the past but problems pop up unannounced
We so drunk that we forgot what we was arguing about
Wanna put the bottle in the trash but I can't 'cause I'm afraid to go without
All I really wanted was a wife and a family, maybe one day own a house
But it ain't that simple with addiction, can't control myself
Gotta get back my ambition, if I don't I fail
Only you can make the right decision, no one else
Instead of going to anger that you're holding
Let it go, 'bout to take a load off, now I just be

[Chorus]
Riding by my lonely (lonely, lonely)
Blowing out the smoke trying to ease my mind
The stars above are glowing (glowing, glowing)
I see em and I hope they can be a sign
There ain't no way of knowing (knowing, knowing)
What the future holds, we can speed up time
'Cause life is like a story (story, story)
I'm hoping in the end things'll be just fine

[Verse 2]
There's a happy ending at the end of every motion picture
(Motion picture, motion picture) But we ain't on no movie set
People look for love but what they visionin' is fiction
(-in' is fiction, -in' is fiction)But this ain't Romeo & Juliet
Friends'll disappear like they were tricked by a magician
(By a magician, by a magician) Out of a hundred, just a few are left
Thinkin' that this shirt that's on my back, that that'll fix it
(That'll fix it, that'll fix it) We're all a victim of a booby trap
Thought that we'd be paid, livin' straight, by the age of 25
Then I'm not, by the time that we were 30, surely, shit will turn around
But it kept reversin' further down the road, it's worser now
Now we lost in the dark, and this spark that we had in our head we burned it out
But I refuse to be content with the status quo
Used the rap platform as a way to vent my
Pain that's inside and maybe then by
Doin' so it might can be a way to lend my
Hand to help somebody that the weight done pinned down
They goin' into work with a fake, pretend smile
To pay the rent by the end of the month
Take a minute, decompress, get high, I just be

[Chorus]
Riding by my lonely (lonely, lonely)
Blowing out the smoke trying to ease my mind
The stars above are glowing (glowing, glowing)
I see em and I hope they can be a sign
There ain't no way of knowing (knowing, knowing)
What the future holds, we can speed up time
'Cause life is like a story (story, story)
I'm hoping in the end things'll be just fine

[Verse 3]
Happy ending, this ain't no album cut
I wrote this for those who pre-order my CD
A simple rap is an appetizer to satisfy them, wish this was a sneak peek
Or the full length album, wearin' this out, you gonna get it with a poster, or free tee
I be signing my booklets, I'm lookin', I'm thinkin' 'bout how good it is to be me
I just want to thank you, four albums later and shit still don't seem real to me
Y'all are the reason my dream came true, you gave me the ability
To have a full time job as a rapper, so many told me to quit, it was impossible
Even if I had a record deal I could never pay the bills
And nobody came to watch my show
I spend your hard earned money when you buy my merch
Money that you spent helped me buy my first
New car and a house even wife my girl
When I write you ignite all the fireworks
Being patient in the line for the meet and greet
But the pleasures all mine, want to shake your hand
You could be brand new or a day one, I'm grateful you became my fan
You might follow me on Facebook and Instagram
Some people got tattoos of me, that's permanent
I want to say how grateful I truly am
I want to put it into words, I can't
It doesn't do it justice for you, it does shit
In layman terms, it's time to wave the flag
C-N-T in this bitch, we the crew
And I owe all to you and the snake and bat
Happy ending
