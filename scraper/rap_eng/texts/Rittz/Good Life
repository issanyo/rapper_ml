[Verse 1]
From the outside looking in
Pictures on the internet, you be thinking all I do is chill and live large
Gotta save what you made when you tour 'cause it’s August and I ain’t made a dollar since March
Shit’ll make you go create a Kickstart page, dark days homie, I was really hit hard
Last year, spent 25 grand trying to help my best friend beat a serious charge
Me and my fiancé been engaged, but to help him with his case, I was dipping in the paper that I saved
For the wedding and the family ain’t chip in shit, so I’m paying for the caterer, the cake, everything
And the dates coming soon, money doing down payments and all of the arrangements are made
Even though we’re going broke so excited to get married, everything felt great for a change
Plus I had some tour dates up in Canada and the wedding’s one month away
That’ll help to support us, Out of nowhere my world got rocked
With some girl I was getting blackmailed and extorted
Wouldn’t pay her, so my lady had to deal with her as torment
Right before the wedding and it ruined it
Honeymoon room with a gorgeous view, can’t enjoy it
We was thinking we was gonna start to live a

Good life
Who doesn’t want to live a good life?
One day I’m gonna live a good life
Shit ain’t as easy as it looks like
Why the fuck is it so hard to live a good life?
Who doesn’t want to live a good life?
One day I’m gonna live a good life
Shit ain’t as easy as it looks like
Why the fuck is it so hard to live a good life?

[Verse 2]
It's a cruel world when you don’t have a day job
Need to take a vacation, instead we got a room at the Aloft for a few days
Chef Chad hooked us up at the Rafain Steakhouse, feeling great now
My lady said it was okay if I went to bed, she stayed up
Got drunk by herself, had one too many, tried to walk, fell and hit her head
Good thing I went to check on her 'cause she was unconscious and drenched in blood
I looked and I could see the white meat
People staring while the paramedics pushed her through the lobby
Now they’re in the hospital hooking her to IVs
Sitting there drunk inside a M.R.E, while they stapling her head
Then she got a CAT scan, came back and they said they found a hemorrhage
On her brain, and explained how bad her condition is
We were having dinner, this gotta be a dream, she just fell
Now you’re telling me her death may come in a matter of some months
We were crying, saying that we love each other and we wish we would have just stayed home
The nurse came back and she said good news, my fault, must have read the x-ray wrong
That your brain’s okay, you should both slow down
If you don’t then you won’t live long have a

[Verse 3]
Gotta separate your homies from your business partners and it’s hard to
Several times, severed ties with my friends who had done a contract and I’m caught up in a lawsuit
My lawyer said I’m gonna take a lose in the courtroom, Gotta settle it and pay 'em like you got loot
Conflict of interest, comes with the business, articles are endless
Tryna figure out who double crossed who, Followed by the devil in a costume
Thought you knew I loved food, cooking is my plan B
Now the doctor tells me what I can and can’t eat, said I’d have a heart attack
Telling me I can’t drink, can’t think without a pill, panicking I can’t breath
Pop a xanex on the couch, me and my wife both no job, no drive, both dying
Both drinking, watching time fly by, but we both die slow
Thought the money would have changed us
We was broke, [?] , but we both know we lucky to be alive
Always wanted to be famous, wonder when we’re gonna wake up, appreciate the luxuries of life
And it doesn’t take a genius to see that drugs and alcohol took its toll, done it one too many times
Getting drunk and took a dive, like fuck if I survive
I don’t want to die, I just want to try to live a
