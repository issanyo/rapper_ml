[Verse 1]
This rap thing ain't happen overnight
Back when I first approached the mic
Get drunk, smoke and write
And put my life in the page but I hope some might
One day blow this mic the negative bullshit I ain't know was white
I'm the rapper you ain't supposed to like
Knowing if the moment is right
Around the corner so I'm about to knock them down like a bowling strike
My flow is like a bowl of lightning
And I know it's frightening and it's almost like my time's finally here
I got everybody eyes and ears on weed now, wonder why they're trying to hear
I spit a verse back then reminiscing on my finer years of high school
I was outta here
I dropped out. Said that I'm 'bout to be a rap star. So much time spent at dead end jobs hoping that a dream would come
Two but it's hard to keep keeping on
Wishing that I would have got a decent job
The money in my pocket, self-esteem is gone
But I still keep a clean pair of sneakers on
Turn it up, let the speakers bump
See me and beat become one in sequence
With the dream, can't nobody keep me from because

[Hook Female]
Ain't no telling what is comin'
When the sun is gone it's stormin'
But I'm gonna overcome it
In the end I'ma be triumphant
Feel it in my stomach
People wanna see you plummet
But i'm gonna rise above it
In the end I'ma be triumphant
I'ma be triumphant
In the end I'ma be triumphant

[Verse 2]
I got no education, no check that came in
It ain't paying the bills, I feel desperation
My dedication to this dream ain't getting me nowhere
There's really no explanation
Why I ain't made it, but now I made my bed
So I'ma lay in it, what a way to live
Dreaming that I'm eating on my daily bread
Wishing I could run a tour, rock a label head
You would recognize my amazingness
Everything I be complaining less
Just to be alive I could say I'm blessed
Life then a dozen roses. Making threats
Won't give a damn what a hater says
I feed the fire when I take it all in
Then, turn me in-to a stronger man
Fly my own flag in the wind 'cause

[Hook Female]
Ain't no telling what is comin'
When the sun is gone it's stormin'
But I'm gonna overcome it
In the end I'ma be triumphant
Feel it in my stomach
People wanna see you plummet
But i'm gonna rise above it
In the end I'ma be triumphant
I'ma be triumphant
In the end I'ma be triumphant
