[Verse 1: Ubiquitous]
It used to be I wan’t brave enough to do it so I’d lie and
Say I did it, now I do it but I’m afraid to admit it
I know some people out there are hatin' pray that I quit it
Provin' those people wrong is just part of staying committed
Pray I remain consistent, smiling and taking pictures
Make your wishes a change of fate, could only take an instant, pimpin
I’m flyin like Aladdin I’ve been Arabian knighted
The current in my life so strong I’d be crazy to fight it
Back in the day recycled sounds had gave me consignment
I wish that Anne could see me now and the way that I’m shinin
Wrestle with pain in private still they can’t fade me at rhymin
Cause all of that pressure that they gave me just made me a diamond

[Hook: Godemis and Ubiquitous](x2)
They try and front but the pressure on us
But y'all know it ain't nothin' for real
It's all to the energy in this piece
I'm saying peace so you know it's for real

[Verse 2: Godemis]
They wavy rotten in the line with them cheapskates
Provide the murder with the word whenever the beat breaks
You, you got a better chance of winning the sweepstakes
Me, I'm playing chicken with a comet in deep space
Unaware who the fuck they fornicating with I flash
You don't feel what I'm spilling pucker up and kiss my ass
Keeping it on the humble they figure I'm a pushover
My PMC's never sober no need of luck from a clover
The opposite of Jehova I know they wanna box me in
I shine inside of the darkness should radiate human being
And seeing me working at it should make you wanna get at it
Come out and support the music and girl maybe even get tatted
Cous'...

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Rittz]
Yeah, I always dreamed that I would be big
Still shaking off the dirt that we did
In the past, it’s too bad we can’t relive
Excuse the prefix, I seen kids get some dope and show off
Too much gets broke off like a tree twig
Some street shit, you wasn’t cut out for no beef, pig
Might got you some paper but you faker than an e-cig
I’m tryna piece it up, I finally made it bro
They’re playing me on the radio but they don’t know like Rico Love
To get to where I’m at was challenging
Talented vultures was flying down on me, trying to stick their talons in
I just drink gallons of crown with my gal and I gallivant
Around Atlanta, bent like an Allen wrench
I’m smiling when there’s pressure
Jonny Valiant and the Ces Cru
Yeah, motherfucker

[Hook][x2]

[Verse 4: Ubiquitous]
Let me keep it real with you, this is the meal ticket
Couple homies still kick it, wonder why’s feel different
I’m livin in the moment, know one day I will miss it
But what is the point of reminiscing while I’m still in it
I kill the mission efficient and chill with bitches
She been feelin interested getting twisted and stealin
Kisses if the pictures surface, chill the missus will misinterpret
I’ll end up in a ditch as a missing person, it’s the gift and the curse
All of that love and attention come with some tension
You motherfuckers bunt for the fences come to your senses
I ain't the one to mention, you’re livin in one dimension
It’s all to the energy and we frigid with numb intention
