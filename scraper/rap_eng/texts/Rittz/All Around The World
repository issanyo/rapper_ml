[Intro]
All around the world
All around the world

[Verse 1:]
I'm just a kid from the G.C
Who would've thought you would see me
On MTV one day, I done came a long way from printing up CDs
Up in the basement on Cruse Road
Used to do shows with no cameras there
Now I'm doing shit in the House of Blues in LA
On stage a whole crowd is cheering me on
Disappear when we gone
Up in the tour bus on to the next state
The last one was eleven weeks long
Friends saying you made it Rittz
You don't play the shit
Eating dry egg stakes on a Vegas trip
Die hard fans that be showing up
They like, "Hey, would you please sign my ladies tits?"
I'm like, fine
You can touch them Rittz I don't mind
I say congratulations on your ladies tits
You got pics donâ€™t put em online
Cause my girl might trip out
Me and her we done had a hard time
7 years we ain't never had a dime
Even though it ain't much it, I feel like I'm getting rich now
I just signed a deal so I'm a get it now
I told Tech and Trav I won't let them down
It's an honor to be a part of Strange Music
A label that's down to go to the extra mile
And I could crack a smile without faking it
Cause a few people knew me in the A
Now I got dudes over in the UK
They getting tattoos of my face they know me all...

[Pre Hook]
Man ya gotta understand like...
I'm so grateful to be in the position I'm in, you know
I been, I been doing this shit for 15 years
It took, it took me 15 years to get to this point
It's real shit

[Hook]
All around the world
All around the world
They know me all around the world
All around the world

[Verse 2]
One time for the homies in Toronto
Fans say that they feel me in Montreal
2 years ago if it wasn't for no bad luck
I'd probably wouldn't have no luck at all
Had to drive my car to do spot days
My piece of junk would stall, not knowing who to call
Shit over heated in Tennessee
Hundred degree weather stranded by Ruby Falls
I'm like no...
Danny Boone, Demun Jones
Help me expand my fan base
When I was dead broke they would throw me some cheese for shows
And that's real
We done stayed in some shitty hotels
Sleeping on top of the covers, wearing socks in the showers
And not knowing if the shit would go well
On stage on the country hall but nobody knew me
Opening for rehab again
5 months later I was on headline
Cheap Jynx Burn One come at me went
Across country fans buyin' tickets just to come see
Me, on my own I ain't had nobody fund me
3 star hotels used to be a luxury
Now we're getting kicked outta' of this for disrupting
Smoking weed, drinking crown
Celebrating Lincoln town
Cars would take us to the after party
Weird I was begging for my pick and out
And I'm blessed but now I gotta go and get more
I was just a kid in Gwinnett with a dream
Tryna' be like Dre and Big Boi
Now they know me all...

[Pre Hook]
Shit, man I'm so lucky man
To be in the position I'm in, you know what I'm saying
You know how many musicians never get discovered
And got talent and shit
I'm getting to live my dream, you know
I just bought a new car and shit
I ain't never had a new car. Yea

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Third verse I'm a dedicate to my homies
Slick boy, Chico, freaky freeze
What up Ralo, trans ain't held me down
But thank God they believed in me
My boys mandatory Irish nut
We hit a motherfucker if we start the but
Shortcut name Rittz and kids named me White Jesus
Look what you started bro that's love
Dallas I done finally came up
For the days and back in 9th grade for the football
Game trying to sound like Bone Thugs
And to the friends I miss
Growing up and we had to part ways
We was young and said it would all change
But its still Clintel homie that is always
Pay homage to my rapping friends we're all vulnerable
Praying one day that we get to live our dreams
They told me the talent is valuable
But truthfully timing is everything
It's unfair
That's why I gotta thank my fans
I could be the best rapper alive but without them nobody really give a damn now they know me all...

[Pre Hook]
Thank you. Naw for real, thank you
I mean you could have all the co-sings in the world, you know
But without fans really, really feeling your music
Really liking your shit, you ain't shit
And I'll never forget that, thank you so much
Yu-uh-yea

[Hook]
