I finally sucka free
So many fake friends tryin suck up to me
Turn my back and I can hear'em talk about me
Underneath they breath wanting to be
In my position hatin when they see me on T.V
You never heard about me let me bring you up to speed
MC can't see me like im invisible
Double Timing the rhyming it's unconventional
But listen I can teach you I should start a Institute
Im on the blog's daily don't know body mention you
Nobody's rockin your Merch, Nobody's copin a verse from you
It's obvious your dumb and you thinking you killing it
But your really just an imbecile
The way I spit the sickest whimsical
Sleeping on me time to wake up
They must be delusional If I was you Id be on time
And never quit my day job
People wanna rap and fall flat like a lady with an A-cup
Neva had no papa so I'm scraping up my cake crumbs
Finally got a deal Been trying to take a pay cut
Been at it for years determined to be mentioned in the
Categories wit the Scarface's and Raekwon's
Ok I might have set my goals to High
But I'm definitely not the rapper to get roasted by
Groupie sweatin me at a show I tell'em open wide
UT Ooh I come and go hello goodybye so don't you try
To step to me, you'll end up on the asphalt
Probably thinkin I'm underneath the influence of Bath $alts
In the Cadillac Drinkin speedin like it's Nascar
Ugly but my girl look like I took her off the cat walk
Hats off when you see me relax yall no back talk
I'ma have to silence the hate they call me Rittz - Jonny Valiant
I be down in the North side of the A
Ye-Ye-Ye-Uh-Yea
