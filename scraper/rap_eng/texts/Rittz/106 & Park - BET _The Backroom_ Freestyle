[Intro: DJ Live]

What up? I'm your boy DJ Live and we're in The Backroom right now
I got the A-Town Ol' Rittz in the building with me right now stepping to that mic
Yo Rittz, step to that mic and speak to it boy..!


[Rittz]

Live from the back room, baboon
I'm an animal and I blew like BOOM!
Every lyric that your hear feeling like a stab wound in your stomach
In the clouds shining like a half moon, get your nose broke get your eyes blacked raccoon
Slow poke hating my raps smack goons in the mouth schooling rappers- Welcome to my class room
Independent killing majors they can smell the gas fumes
My Cadillac VROOOM!, 85 north, A-town, homie, we ain't riding skate boards
My boys hittting licks they ain't trying to pay for it
Down on my luck forgive me when I pray Lord
Rapping for the underground until I'm in the grave yard, they be rooting for me on the TV screen
White got soul like i'm B.B.King, a rock star like I'm B. Springsteen
You wanna battle ring the bell, homie, DING! DING! DING!, dodging bullets hear 'em PING! PING! PING!
Everybody be ducking and what i'm smoking looking greener than a string green bean
Up in my cutlass dummy it's money green, she seen me on the shelf in the store cause my albums out
Its "The Life And Times of Jonny Valiant" now, go and get it if you like what you hearing
If you didn't, you don't know what you talking bout!

Strange Music, Slumerican, Northside A-town

Ya-uh-yeah!!!!
