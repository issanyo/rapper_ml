(Hook)
Been out on the road so long I
Feel like I'm locked out my own life
It could be worse it ain't like I'm dying
Lonely is my company
Can't wait to get home and relax
But I'm out here grinding believe that
It could be worse but the fact remains that
Lonely is my company

(Verse 1)
This touring shit ain't what you think it is
Coming up in this music biz ain't  glamorous
We just left Atlanta drove from Boston to Los Angeles
Somewhere in between I lost my mind like I began to just
Party like I'm trying to die call an ambulance
I almost overdosed again
My time is mostly spent
Alone inside my room at some shitty motor inn
There's  roaches in the shower
But the show is in an hour
When it's over we inside the van on the road again
Last night I got so drunk that I was comatose I went
And punched a bunch of holes up in the wall and broke my hand
Puking blood from too much liquor tripping snorting coke with fans
One of my closest friends called my phone and asked me how's it been
Told him man I been…

(Hook)

(Verse 2)
On tour with Tech I had to catch a plane to Hollywood
Mansion in the hills
Shooting Switch Lanes I done made it
Can't believe it's real
Right in the middle of us filming got a text from my girl
Pictures of her bloody face
She slit her wrist and fell
Pills in her system
Doctors said she tried to kill herself
Put her in a padded room
Sent her to a mental health
Facility they're telling me that they won't let her out
1000 miles away there's only so much I can do to help
Now my album's coming out in like a week or so
My videos on MTV
The love of my life is stuck in Georgia Regional
They let her use the phone
She called me and she's crying
Saying "Get me out!" "I'm trying"
At the meet and greet I'm lying
Like I'm fine, I've been dying

(Hook)

(Verse 3)
I was out on tour with Snow and Jarren Benton
It's so embarrassin when
You're drunk and acting dumb
A ton of strangers there to witness
Late nights with DJ crisis getting drunk and talking business
In the winter overheating
Turning on the air condition
Mostly I was lonely
Talking no one there to listen 
Crying in the mirror staring at my own reflection
Drugs and alcohol got me all emotional
Overall I'm in no condition to battle my own addiction
Before you know it though the tour is over so it's history
Missing Thanksgiving day but hey you made it home for Christmas
You see the one you love and try to pick up where you left it
I love her and I missed her
But she says I'm acting distant
Told her listen I've been

(Hook)
