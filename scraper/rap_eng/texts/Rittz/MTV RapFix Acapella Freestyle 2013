[Verse 1:]
Nobody kill a beat like me, admit it
Me taking over couldn't be prevented
I'm sick, I need to see a clinic
Ain't tryna save, I take my cheese and spent it
Signed a deal and got my Buick Regal tinted
Put some speakers in it, bought some sneakers then I hit the bank - I
Withdrew some money, you could tell the teller could smell the dank of a chink guy
Like I was born in Shanghai, smoking dro in Tokyo
I go for broke that I would stop, but you was hoping so
So Rittz is heading to the top, they're like "I hope he don't"
[?] of growing old like Master P and Romeo
You feeling froggy? jump, these punks don't want to do-si-do
Pinocchio rappers lying, they never sold a O
I pulled an okey-doke, [?] but every time you rhyme you on some desperado ish like you Antonio Banderas
Blowing up like airbags, ripping a rapper's pair of Jeremy Scott's, these ain't no Air Max
Another bloody murder, run a circle around your square ass
All you could do is just stare as we take flight
You mad this ain't your aircraft, you hate life
You're broke and barely scrape by
This industry's an ocean, I'm a great white shark they might get ate by - killed
Prey like a snake bite, so pump your breaks boy
Before I swing and knock the daylights outta ya
Running your mouth online is fun until you see my face outside of the window in your momma's house
And now you can't come out of your own home, you coward
Got your girl and we showered an hour
Bodies loose, we was screwing around [?]
Dog, if I was you, I would be too
I'd probably kill myself, if there was a way that I could be you
I'm finally making green, is that the reason you seem blue?
Your blue jeans too tight, things that you think's cool
I think is lame as hell - and cheesy, there ain't no Babybels
So many MCs that want to be trendy [?] paint they nails
They call me Ri-Rittz, I came to claim the ATL
Competition scared, people 'pare to take a L
Ye-uh yeah
