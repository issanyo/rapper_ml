[Intro]
Yeah
Sometimes I just get fucking pissed off
I just get sick of all this bullshit

[Verse 1]
Shit's sad growing up in the gutter
But I made a lot of kids want to be like I am
It's weird, people see you on the come up
Think you happy with some money but I'm mean and I'm pissed
My girlfriend knows that I love her
But I mentally abuse her and I treat her like shit
We both suicidal, she a cutter
All I do is self-loath, what's the reason I live?
Bunch of empty liquor bottles in the cupboard
Lying to each other like next week we'll quit
Get drunk, make a straw outta dollar
But it's okay, it's only cocaine, not meth
My family looking at me like a fuck up
And they're right, and I don't want to disappoint my twin
I pray one day I'll recover
But it's like I'm tryin' to schedule an appointment with the - devil
Lord knows I don't wanna - die
So I'm begging, praying help me please
I lie like I'm covering for someone
With anxiety and I ain't got no self-esteem
Lot of people are going wanna tell me shut up
Cause they got it way worse, I'm a selfish piece of shit
Make a motherfucker wonder, what it's gonna take for me to change mentally
Bags underneath my eyes cause I live too fast
Grey hairs on my beard
Feelin' like I can't breathe if I don't take a pill so I'm always on a Xan
Drink a bottle every night, I feel them doing damage to my liver
I ain't ever been this fat and disgusting
I don't wanna rap, I wanna nap on my love-seat
I ain't sayin' this to get no pity, I'm just feelin' shitty
Lookin' like a piece of metal rusting, and trust me

[Hook]
And I don't really like
The person I've become
This isn't who I thought I would turn into when I was young
But now I'm grown and they say I'm
No Good (x6)
I'm just a drug addict, drunk, I'm
No Good (x6)
They say I need to turn my life around

[Verse 2:]
I don't know, maybe I'm a hater
I'm supposed to write a rap, but I hate rap now
Stop breathin' when I'm sleeping then I wake up
Still in my clothes, can't remember how I passed out
Lately I'm an angry drunk am I'm afraid I
Might have been a dick, best friend's gettin' cussed out
But, fuck it then I guess I'll found out later
What I done, 'nother hungover day bummed out
True shit I ain't no exaggerator
Nose bleedin', trying to act like I ain't sniff shit
People think they're motivating me to take up a different lifestyle
Fuck them and their Fitbit
They just wanna help but don't appreciate uh
Cause they love me, and they don't wanna see me die young
Every day I'm dissapointin' my creator
I've been strugglin' to get up out the hole I dug
Lately I've been switchin' over to the vapor
Chain smokin Newports hope I don't crush my lungs
I can see my future and it's as plain as day my
Girl cryin' to the operator, calling 9-1-1
I tour, blessed to be an entertainer
Been spendin' months away from home, there's nothing I find fun
Signed a record deal, I love the record label
Three albums later, underrated when it's my time come
Couldn't afford the tour bus, so I went and bought a van
There's some money selling records, so I got to tour again
I don't wanna bore the fans, so I bought a couple lights
Plus some background singers, but I can't afford a band
Jealous of these rich rappers and the money that they make
I was up outside of Chili's having lunch and a lame
Started rooting for his team on the screen
When I see happy people wanna punch them in the face
I'm ashamed cause

[Hook:]
I don't really like
The person I've become
This isn't who I thought I would turn into when I was young
But now I'm grown and they say I'm
No Good (x6)
I'm just a drug addict, drunk, I'm
No Good (x6)
They say I need to turn my life around

[Outro:]
Yeah!
Ye-ye-ye-uh-
Ye-ye-ye-ye-FUCK!
Fuck it
