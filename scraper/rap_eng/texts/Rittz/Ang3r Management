Excuse me, Rittz is here to see you

[Rittz]
Yo, what's up man, you wanted to see me?

[record exec]
Hey, what's up Rittz man? Have a seat

[Rittz]
Yeah, pretty excited about first week man, evrything's going good right?

[record exec]
Ima be completely honest with you here Rittz, your last album was called Next to Nothing, this should've been called thanks for nothing, because that's exactly what this is

[Rittz]
What're you talking about?

[record exec]
I can't work with this shit

[Rittz]
Why not? I think it's some of my best work

[record exec]
You know why Tech's been so successful at building an empire?

[Rittz]
Yeah, he's Tech N9ne, he's amazing

[record exec]
Because he's not rapping about snorting coke off of assholes and committing suicide

[Rittz]
I mean that, I rap about, that's what I do in real life and it's my music you know?

[record exec]
Hey, you know what Sonya from Best Buy had to say?

[Sonya]
What up. This is Sonya, the buyer from Best Buy. I just listened to Rittz's new album. Really? He must be slipping. If I bring this crap into Best Buy it better sell, or I'll be pissed. Oh, real talk, put a sister on the guest list next time Rittz is in town, cause Sonya don't do lines

[record exec]
Yeah, how bout that? Oh, and here's one from Violet Brown. Here's what Violet Brown had to say

[Rittz]
Wait, wait, but Violet Brown's my friend

[record exec]
Is she?

[Rittz]
Yeah

[record exec]
Well listen to this:

[Violet Brown]
Hey Rittz, this is Violet Brown. It's been 16 years, man, since anything has moved me. I'm calling you right now, as you're listening to Top of the Line, to tell you to go fuck yourself, man. Rittz, go fuck yourself

[Rittz]
Jesus Christ

[record exec]
You know what Rittz? Never mind. This album's not gonna fucking come out. You know what? Go write me another sad song and get the fuck out of my office
