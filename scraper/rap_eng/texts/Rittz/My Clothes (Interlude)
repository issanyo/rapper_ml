Let me tell you something right now
Don't you ever try to call me back
You understand me?
I'm gonna say this right now for the record
I'm 100 percent on my mom's life
On my sister's life, on your life
I never ever ever caught a fucking girl
Never
Some bitch gave me a fucking number
With some meth attached to it
I took it and threw it to the table
I don't know who the fuck called that bitch
But it's sure as fuck wasn't me
I told you never ever ever ever ever try to touch my fucking clothes
And realize that I'm the only only fucking reason you have any structure in your life
Do you fucking understand me?
I will fucking bury you
I will fucking kill you
I will fucking push you under the fucking ground
Do you fucking understand me?
You little motherfucker
I'm out here tryin to make a living for the both of us
You fucking ungrateful, you fucking asshole
I'm out here tryin to make a living for us
And all you give a fuck about is some bitches
And facebook, stay the fuck off of facebook
Do you understand me?
I am fucking sick , all day long I was hoarse trying to talk to you
I will fucking bury you
Do you fucking understand me?
You put my fucking clothes back you son of a bitch
