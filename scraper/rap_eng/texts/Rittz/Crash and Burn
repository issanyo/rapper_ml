[Verse 1]
My homie and his girl just had a kid
They debated keeping it at first but now they're glad they did
People doubting he's a daddy, but he adamant he is
Both of them cheated round the time that she conceived it, he believing that it's his
His family tell him take a test so we'll be sure
But that just pissed him off, so he side with his baby momma more
He could see himself inside the baby's eyes, it bring him joy
Plus they was on the verge of breaking up
They thought the pregnancy would be the cure to stay together
But instead it was the last straw
She's crying saying that they need to talk
She told him that her ex took a test, he's the daddy of the baby
Now he got a broken heart up in the car

[Hook]
He's on the road now
Feeling zoned out
Need to slow down
'Cause you're going full speed ahead
Swerving on the road now
Feeling zoned out
Need to slow down
'Cause you're going full speed ahead
'Bout to crash and burn

[Verse 2]
She was just a teen when dad got busted cheating, parents got divorced
Mom done lost her voice from crying so much, lots of shock, absorbed
Family structure crumbled. Lost support
Used to talk about college courses with her dad while watching sports
Now he just honks the horn and leaves , the peace done got restored
He just chops the doors, split the family up in pieces, tears are seeping through the carpet floor
Mom ain't home to watch and lock the doors
One time she lost it when she caught some boys inside her daughter's closet in their boxer shorts
She could discipline her, when she tried her daughter fought her
She blamed her, saying she's the reason she don't got a father
She's always on the bottle, drunk when momma called the police
'Cause she slapped and snatched the cash up out her purse and stole her keys

[Hook]
She's on the road now
Feeling zoned out
Need to slow down
'Cause you're going full speed ahead
Swerving on the road now
Feeling zoned out
Need to slow down
'Cause you're going full speed ahead
'Bout to crash and burn

[Verse 3]
He's an entertainer , yeah , it beats a nine to five
Sometimes he's scared there'll be a day when he runs out of rhymes
Sick of having to repeat himself a thousand times
But be careful you'll get eaten, these are mountain lions surrounded by
These wolves ,only dressed like sheep
Some people whoop when I lit my dream
But I still ain't rich, I don't got a plan B
Get the fans and then I cop
Jump ship, I sink
So I gotta hit the road, only way to get paid
So my lady at home gotta patiently wait
She's afraid when I'm gone ,gotta pray I'm okay
How much more can I take from the fame and the stage

[Hook]
I'm on the road now
Feeling zoned out
Need to slow down
'Cause you're going full speed ahead
Swerving on the road now
Feeling zoned out
Need to slow down
'Cause you're going full speed ahead
'Bout to crash and burn

[Outro]
And do you have to learn
Before you have returned
Beneath the grass and dirt
Besides the casket/urns
We'll put your ashes first
Come bring you back to Earth
Before you crash and burn
