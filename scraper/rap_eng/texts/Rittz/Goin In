(Verse 1 Rittz)
The-the-the-they say who the white boy that done signed with strange
No security, but I don't gotta hide my chain
A lot of rappers cryin' now they see that i done came up
Maybe some of these babies need a diaper change
I'm driving drunk I'm bout to hydro-plane, but i don't care though
Flyer than a jet-liner at a air show
Custom jeremy scott i bet you wish you had a pair ho
Try to hit a lick i'll leave you stiffer than a scarecrow
Weed I'm smokin' purple like a varicose vein
Strange piece hangin' from the franco chain
A select few newcomers get approved from us
We just make fun of no way jose
I'm surprised i gotta fan base
Can't fake with em try and I'll deprive you of a handshake
Can't wait til my album drop
Ima cop a monte carlo supersport tee top and a mansion with a man cave
Choppin' up trees like a landscape, growin' plants
Motherfuckers wanna copy me like photo prints
I ain't changed signed a record deal with no advanced
Makin' show money on the road again blowin' grands, open hands
Coming from a brown nosing friends, like these groupies showin skin
They expose themselves
I got the competition overwhelmed
Swingin when i heard the openin' bell get KO'd or killed its like

(hook x2)
Just when you thought that you've seen it all
I come outta nowhere ring the alarm
Chain Tarzan swinging black beanie on
You know the word bitch sing along this shit goes like this
Bitch take cover, I'm goin' in
Bitch take cover, I'm goin' in
Better take cover, I'm goin' in
Uh oh, here we go again

(Verse 2 Rittz)

So fuck what the Mayans say
Cause I just set a record deal
When the plan is too annihilate
In 2013 I was warmin up on the Revival Tape
These motherfuckers sleeping now they see I'm wide awake
I got â€˜em caught inside my web like a spider egg
I was already hot the booth is like a fire place
The bitches wouldn't give me the of time of day
Tryna' to beg for it, dick wetter than a wiper blade
It's rape when I stick it in 'em
Stacks so big hard to fit it in my Denim
Sippin Grey Goose straight with the hint of lemon
Buzz on the Street getting bigger, bet you wish you had a similar
Dilemma Northside representers Steve Reynolds down the indian trail
Weed greener than some spinach or kale
I'm like a chemical spill on the street
I'm toxic on that white boy shit
Slumerican Moshpit then we swap Chicks
Bout' to turn your girl into a straight whore
Wasted at the bar fuck a tab I don't pay for it
6 deep and the super 8 on the same floor
Geek crushing up speed with the AAA Card
Another 8 ball came when I came and carved my name
In the paved cement sippin Canadian Club, it's 8am
And I ain't been asleep yet
Let the games begin it's like

(Hook)

(Verse 3 Rittz)

I did it I'm guilty, my lyrics are filthy
I'm the rapper these fat bitches ask about
Should've asked around before you fuck with me
Now turn your ass around we're going ass to mouth
We're doing massive amounts of coke
What you thought I was lying on the remix of Cashin Out You wanna sniff Some get my dick sucked by a young bitch
Bumpin' a Taylor Swift song when they get you pissed off
It's fiction you can't believe every single word you hear in the record
We just be rhymin stupid dumby you a mummy
You ain't feeling me you're dead or you a zombie
Simple minded would you rather talk about illuminati? What you juice and do Pilates, you read and you meditate
Watch the history channel you really think
These rappers are part of some secret society
You probably think that David Blaine levitates
Probably think I'm hooked on meth I can't quit my habit
Ri ri ri rittz in this bitch and back at it
Bout' to kill another victim that shit is tragic
My dad's a maniac too I figure it's genetics
Synthetic no etiquette shit is just pathetic
You step to me you gonna fuck around and get Be-headed
On the stage butt naked drunk n' grabbin my dick, saying any girl that wanna suck it can grab it, I said it
And

(Hook)
