[Verse 1]
North side shit, you can find me out on beaver ruin
Up inside a Cutlass or a Buick
Instead of hating on it just salute it
Don’t be sad my car looks better than the one that I see you in
The police pulled me over, I was cooling
Tried to say that I was under the influence
Well I was on the brew and on a pill
Said I got a script, tell em I don’t distribute it
I got a plan, it’s time to execute it
Awhile ago man I was going through it
Now I’m looking like I’m MJ
Dunking on a bunch of Patrick Ewings, like you win
Your money grow, a ton of hoes be chewing
But fuck em, I ain’t into rescuing, but you can
I’m smoking on that Cali when I flew in
But it 770 you know I’m bout to go tattoo it
My crew be kicking it on Steve Reynolds road
You wanna holler, meet me at the Dollar General
I’m with a Slum bitch by the name of Indigo
She known to twerk it like she working on the stripper pole
A playmate, face, body like a centerfold
I get her hooked, leave her squirming on my fishing pole
I get a stack of Benjamins up in a envelope
It’s time to let em know it’s 7-7-0, cause I...

[Hook]
Started in the A, now it’s nation wide
All around the world I be getting love
Look at how I do it, I ain’t got to try
So fly, man it’s in my blood
And I’m sitting straight
I’m living good
Want to hate on me, I wish you would
I’m sitting straight
I’m living good
Getting money that you wish that you could
I put my foot in a brand new pair of Js
Everywhere we go, people stare at us
I was born to be a star, I ain’t got to try
I’m so fly, man it’s in my blood
And I’m sitting straight
I’m living good
Want to hate on me, I wish you would
I’m sitting straight
I’m living good
Getting money that you wish that you could

[Verse 2]
You know I party every day like it’s the weekend
We was getting drunk at 3pm
Eyes leaning like I’m a Korean
Drinking Jameson, has got me feeling European
These bitches showing titties on my DM
Chiefing Colorado in my G-Pen
Haters, they don’t really want no beef, nah
Heaters turn a hater to a vegan, now beat it
I beat them up and leave them on the cement
Swimming in the money, stick your feet in
My tour manager that my TM
He be sending all the bitches to the lobby in the Sleep-Inn
And we ain’t even peaked, this a pre-lim'
My life is like a movie you can sneak in, so peep it
I’m leaning in my Cutlass, playing who’s that creeping in your window
In a ski mask, these motherfuckers sleeping

[Bridge]
Cause I be representing for the north side of Atlanta
I stand out in a crowd so they start pulling out they camera
Bout to speed it up, I slow it down so there ain’t no misunderstanding
That I’m bout to blow, on that dro and that Marilyn Monroe
Arrogant, no, but it's apparent I'm dope
And they know I

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Internet tripping on my new release
Killing the industry like I went on a shooting spree
My pockets finally growing up, they went through puberty
I spent a couple hundred dollars on my shoes at least
I got your boo stripping, coming out her Gucci jeans
Some ooh wee and a bottle full of booze to drink
And baby blue '82 Caprice, if you cool I'mma take it down a few degrees
And you know I

[Hook]
