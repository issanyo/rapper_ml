[Verse 1]
They should know by now, when I rap I got a reputation
Causin' devastation, I get down for mine
See Tech N9ne fucked around and signed
An individual that's visibly out his mind
It's hard to count the times, how many rappers I've
Massacred, Al Capone,  and every day is St. Valentine's
It's Jonny Valiant, I'm the first thing that comes to mind
When you hit the Gwinnett County line
I'm on powder and Crown combined
I like to mix the uppers with the liquor then I switch up
Poppin' the Klonopins, I got me a prescription
Watch out for the rappers tryna plot another stick up
Reminisce the kids in my clique that ain't with us anymore
They ain't live to see past twenty
Tryna see fast money, got they ditch dug early
So no wonder why it's hard to be religious
White boy shit, we ain't hoppin' in a pickup
They depict us to be redneck
Let my bread stack till I'm in a Benz truck, limo tint
Gotta wipe a pimp down with a lint brush
Oh-ee, Louie
Symbol on my shoe, blew two Gs, too clean
Groupies turning up, they wanna fuck
And turn the bus into a nude scene, that's routine
Fuck the YouTube views and your news feed
'Cause your whole style is whack
You getting clout nowadays when you sound exactly like another man
I ain't tryna vouch for that
Used to wear button downs and slacks but now you trap
You strapped but you swear that you down to clash
'Cause mumble rap's in style you be trying hard to sound relaxed
You take words and pronounce them bad
To sound like you have an accent, really that's it?
I never thought I'd use the word "flabbergasted"
It's an exact fit to explain my reaction, like I'm yackin' in a trash bin
I don't use a bunch of ad-libs to distract fans
I combine the real with the metaphors and bars
From the wheel struggling to get a deal
Through the valley in the hills
Like you tryna win the Tour de France
You can't tell me I don't kill shit
Turn me up with the Coup√© de Ville feel with a foreign car
Been ten years and I'm still lit
Now my Colorado homies, and it's twenty past four o'clock
It's last call but I got another quart to pop
And I ain't ever wore a cap and gown
But got mass amounts of cash to count
I'm rapping now for spazzing out
So tell 'em when they ask around

[Hook]
I get down
Down for mine, down for mine
I get down
Down for mine, down for mine
I get down
Down for mine, get down for mine
I told 'em I don't fuck around about a thousand times
I show out and shine with no doubt in mind
I get down
Down for mine, down for mine
I get down
Down for mine, down for mine
I get down
Down for mine, get down for mine
I told 'em I don't fuck around about a thousand times
I show out and shine with no doubt in mind
I get down

[Verse 2]
That's truth that you can't dispute
It's CNT in this bitch, what a man'll do
Dick Tracy, attention to
I'd be the same ol' me if I wore tight pants and boots
Is that a diss? Incorrect, get an 'X' like (buzzer)
Ain't no family feud, the seed planted bloomed
We hit Atlanta, flew to France and landed Coco Vance and broke madams and pampered dudes
Them ugly motherfuckers smiling for the camera crew
I'm getting bands of loot, the broke shit discussion
'Cause I finally got a check, we can stretch out money
Maybe you were meant to be a fitness instructor
Witness destruction when I represent for the misfits amongst us
The old heads, kids, and youngsters
Fuck with me you'll be stuck on me
Like you had unsafe sex with an ex of Usher's
Is you a bald bitch? What you need a hairpiece? Got the herpes?
Sue me, I'ma throw you down the staircase
You try to tell me that I broke too many barricades
That's why you never hear my music on the airwaves
I drop a nuke on every record, that's an air raid
Pull your hair weave, bitch suck and bob
I need to find a chick kinda like Blac Chyna
To give me all the checks she collect from Rob
You never see 'em interview me on the The Breakfast Club
But they know me in New Zealand and Czech Repub
Up in Cleveland and Lincoln, Nebraska, Reno, Nevada
Alaska has extra love
Mic check like Tech, I'm a regular
You saw All Eyez on Me, thought you was 2Pac
But you a Little Richard homie wop-bop-a-loo-bop
You shocked that I blew up?
I thought that you knew

[Hook]
I get down
Down for mine, down for mine
I get down
Down for mine, down for mine
I get down
Down for mine, get down for mine
I told 'em I don't fuck around about a thousand times
I show out and shine with no doubt in mind
I get down
Down for mine, down for mine
I get down
Down for mine, down for mine
I get down
Down for mine, get down for mine
I told 'em I don't fuck around about a thousand times
I show out and shine with no doubt in mind
I get down
