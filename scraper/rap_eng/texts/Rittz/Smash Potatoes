[Intro]
Yeah-Uh-Yeah
Slumerican shit...
Yeaah

[Verse]
The machine gonna stank
It's a Burn One beat, time to burn a sweet
In the studio, smoking something purplely
When it occurred to me
You might have heard of me
If not then follow me I take you on a murder spree
I've been reading all the comments every person leaves, trying not to take the criticism personally
Trying to tell me that I need to show diversity
I love to hear 'em try and spit a hotter verse then me
They can't cause verbally, I'm hercules, I murder beats, I murk MC
Kill 'em and bury 'em in the dirt beneath, and hop in the hearse and speed off
Leave 'em for the worms to feed, I'm in the lead, I've been hot for a hot sec...
"Got a record deal, Rittz?"
Not yet but I got a lot of prospects
And I'm gettin hotter and now they got me on the front of DJbooth.net, live and direct
I'm fresh baby '87 monte carlo
Drinkin' pineapple snapple mixed with del melado
With a little Cointreau
North side G shit
Ya'll be making pop songs, ale-alejandro
Get found duct taped right inside your condo
Bragger trying to show off weight
Everybody know you're so not paid
Your flow is so not great
Your style is played out like rappers in the mo-hawk phase
So why you playing with me homie this ain't no arcade
Pushin' the wrong buttons and jumping all on my joystick
I don't give a fuck if you're voicetress, I'll destroy shit
I ain't trying to go back to driving a fucking forklift
Get fired, tired of filing unemployment, it's embarrassing having to borrow money for gas
Getting' fucked in the ass, like a ho in a porn flick
Now you fucking with a little bit of nut and a half
Old pie face rocking tight jean with a G-shock
Need to go and get some Maybelline with some knee highs
Please guys, be wise, besides
You don't want to swing at a bee hive
Get stung 17 times
Mama la pinga you can suck it and love it ho
My manager telling me that its finally crunch time...
But I'm sick of the industry like I'm sick of these rappers ad-libing every time they come with a punch line haaaa
Fun time busting these rappers
I better calm down, I need a muscle relaxer
Can't eat, can't sleep
Just geek geek geek on ice
All night like I play for the thrashers
This-this-this some DJ Booth shit
GA music, we make movies
Homie we ain't losing...
In a old school ride, looking so brand new bitch
I'm floating like I'm driving a cruise ship
You know I got a grip on the wood grain foot on the gas
All hoes look when I pass...
They love it when I roll up
When I roll up
Every time I roll up on that ass...

Yeah-Uh-Yeah
