[Intro]
Rittz up in this bitch again
Those who listen, witnessin'
Uncut dope, I lift a pen
And those who diss get disciplined
My imprint is infinite
Getting tense and intimate
When I'm pissed shit hits the fan
(Who's ready for Rittz?!)

[Verse 1]
This rap game's so mundane, I just play dumb
Trying to listen to songs playing, then what main come
Making fun of them, none of them ever was A1
Trying to front like they John Wayne, well I'm James Bond
In my blood-stained tux, people that played me they thinking they got away with it
I'm taking out my frustration
Finally shedded the dead weight, settled the debt, paid
We done shoveled the red clay, we dug graves up
Got a couple of homies that owe me some favors
And show they appreciation, they told me that they would bust they guns
But instead of it I debted it and just gave love
I’ve been heavily indebt and I done took pay cuts
Might have been a lot to me, to them it was just cake crumbs
I’ve done been around a minute, but I just came up
Hungry for dinner, but shit, I just ate lunch
At the Optimus, tapas, scallops and crustaceans
Tuna tartare, the way to act above all, like wah lah
I’m sipping crown and soda, but I would rather have the monarch
Thinking bout how far came when I’m out on tour
4 AM I’m in the bed, I’m drunk and I’m staring at the wall art
I fought off the competition like I was a war lord
I swore I should have blew in 2002, but given a minute
I would hit a higher altitude, then I surprised you from out the blue



[Hook]
From the middle of nowhere
People wonder how I blew, where I come from
The middle of nowhere
I'm on tour my crowd's the proof, in some town in
The middle of nowhere
You should watch your mouth 'cause you, might get punched from
The middle of nowhere
It might be lights out for you, you get found in
The middle of nowhere

[Verse 2]
This your first time hearing me, then you should go backwards
Listen to Top of the Line and study the craftwork
Then check out Next to Nothing, that was me expressing what I thought it was and what it wasn’t by becoming a rapper
After that then play The Life and Times of Jonny Valiant
Listen to "My Interview" and study my answers
Then check out White Jesus, that was me, yeah
In the studio after working a double and my back hurt
Staining my apron, pouring buckets in the grease trap
Thinking that I need to try and take a G.E.D. class
Thirty and hurting for money, feeling like a sleaze bag
Feelings that I had are reoccurring when I recap
People biting me up in my lane without a Peach Pass
I ain’t gonna touch on that
I put on debt, but look I’m next, I took my steps, I stood out
I’m feeling like there ain’t no one I couldn't out-rap
But since I made it people wonder why I look all mad
Because I’ve been trying to ride a wave, I'm in a boat without a paddle
Start to notice shit as I was growing as an adult
It’s hard for me to sugarcoat it like a bowl of Kellogg’s
They love you for a minute, but they’re quick to say you fell off
But I’ve been getting bigger and bigger and bigger
Mistaking me from the beginning, they still be getting overshadowed
The fans love me and they gonna travel to the


[Hook]
The middle of nowhere
People wonder how I blew, where I come from
The middle of nowhere
I'm on tour my crowd's the proof, in some town in
The middle of nowhere
You should watch your mouth 'cause you, might get punched from
The middle of nowhere
It might be lights out for you, you get found in
The middle of nowhere

[Verse 3]
Want bars or want me to chop?
I’mma do both then, I’m like a piranha inside a bowl of goldfish
It’s hard for you to smell me like your nose is clothes pinned
I went and did a show in Minnesota, Bone Twins
No shit, so lit, no rapper’s my match
With white trash, getting money acting high class
High stacks, it’s hard to fold the bills
Pockets fat as Jonah Hill before and after the gastric bypass
Chugging the Zinfandel, then I smash the wine glass
Picture my dick, the bitches had to bat they eyelash
A maximum line slash from Dimebag Darrell, long hair and don’t care I wanna catch down back
You at the IMAX theatre ‘bout to see me in 3D
Listening like they had me wiretapped
Paid cash for fast cars, you had to finance
Scientist inside of my lab


[Hook]
In the middle of nowhere
People wonder how I blew, where I come from
The middle of nowhere
I'm on tour my crowd's the proof, in some town in
The middle of nowhere
You should watch your mouth 'cause you, might get punched from
The middle of nowhere
It might be lights out for you, you get found in
The middle of nowhere
