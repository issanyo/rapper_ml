My shit’s snapping, my shit-my shit’s snapping
Speakers and tweeters beating, my whip got that rattle back
My shit’s snapping, my shit-my shit’s snapping
My whip got that rattle back, my whip got that rattle back

[Verse 1]
You can find me out on [?] hill with Sally Ray Deville
24s on it got a [?] dressed to kill
Tryna smoke another Phillie while I grip the wheel
Weed spinning out the window like a weather reel
Still sipping on Bacardi with that ginger ale
Riding like a bitch, like a fish, smelly round the wheel
Kick off your heels and knock them, bitch let’s go pop some pills
I got the Xanax, white girl looking like Paris Hilton
Hair cut low like Keri Hilson
Kept saying that she turned me on, and she jerked me off
Kept swerving I could barely help it
12 was roofless, and then Yelawolf is
On my CD player, somewhere to go
Speakers booming, and my beeper booming
Tryna go and get a bottle from the liquor store
Then I kissed the ho, and told her thanks for the handjob
Bitch see you later, bye
Then it’s back inside the Cadillac on 85
Coppers want to follow us and try to give us DUIs
They be thinking that we drinking and we way too high
Probably right, got an 8 ball of white and some rock a wear
Everybody stop and stare when they hear all the knock that I got to hear
Will shake many out a rocking chair
Roll down the window a cloud appear
Looked like a goddamn volcano
Saying hi to the haters like they know
Niggas in the chain know what it is
Lame old, they know

[Hook]
My shit’s snapping, my shit-my shit’s snapping
Speakers and tweeters beating, my whip got that rattle back
My shit’s snapping, my shit-my shit’s snapping
My whip got that rattle back, my whip got that rattle back
My shit’s snapping, my shit-my shit’s snapping
Speakers and tweeters beating, my whip got that rattle back
My shit’s snapping, my shit-my shit’s snapping
My whip got that rattle back, my whip got that rattle back

[Verse 2]
These hoes just love my speakers, sounds like Justin Bieber
Tied up in the trunk and kicking
Blacked out Mustang, Dub Edition
We in the front puffing on some Bubblicious
Just delicious, mustard business
All we talk about is money motherfucker listen
Got concussive stitching, Rittz in the head
Rest like a redneck revving up the engine
At the red light, ain’t nobody fresh like me
Feel like I got everybody out here beat
Chain still swang on the [?] tee, yelling out I’m pimping
Know they get the outfit free
Got the ADID, ASJS, wings on my ring like [?]
[?] got your Aviators, I’m afraid of majors
Take an eye out every time I wave to haters
Rocking imitation jakers, seal the fate of fakers
Everything is [?]
Ain’t no other rapper hotter than me who ain’t got a deal
Last year record labels didn’t want to sign me now they probably will
Still got the coke residue sticking to my dollar bills
Still represent [?] and [?] until they put me in a mausoleum
Living in the club and the coliseum
Bout to get a cup of Xanax bars and eat 'em
Ain’t nobody really give a shit when I was struggling and working for the minimum wage
But now they want to say that’s it when I spit really get
When they see me on the stage they say that

[Hook]
My shit’s snapping, my shit-my shit’s snapping
Speakers and tweeters beating, my whip got that rattle back
My shit’s snapping, my shit-my shit’s snapping
My whip got that rattle back, my whip got that rattle back
My shit’s snapping, my shit-my shit’s snapping
Speakers and tweeters beating, my whip got that rattle back
My shit’s snapping, my shit-my shit’s snapping
My whip got that rattle back, my whip got that rattle back
