[Intro]
See what's goin' on in this mothafucker
Bitch pass me that mothafuckin blunt mothafuckin' trippin'
God damn lame, let me see what's goin' on.. What's happenin'

[Verse 1]
Check it out we taking shots, posted up
Drinking that Crown we toasting cups
Bitches looking at us like they so in love, they about to go uncut, no one’s frustrated we faded we celebrating life cause we made it we elevated and we smoking bud
The party doesn't end until we sober up
'Til your ladies layin' naked on the sofa drunk
Better come on in, get inside
Slick brought the pills Rowdy Bizzle brought the white
When I mix em' it's a feeling that I can't describe
But I guess I'll give my best to try
Daily shit can get too heavy to carry so every now and then my body needs the opposite of exercise
So I pull the plastic wrapper off the cap of my
Crown Royal bottle, somewhere in Gwinnett you'll find me

[Hook]
Chilling
I'm high
I'm feeling
Sublime
No killing
My vibe
If you're drinking raise your glasses high
Cause we ain't trippin' on the past or the afterlife
Cause right now we sippin' on that Crown Royal
Drunk when I pulled up, they already know what's in my cup, they know I'm sippin' on that Crown Royal
This ain't no champagne, they already know what's in my drank

[Bridge]
I pull that crown up outta that purple bag
Crown up outta that purple bag
Crown up outta that purple bag
That purple bag
They know I'm sippin' on that Crown Royal

[Verse 2]
We've been turned up all day long, long day off
We gon' drink until the alcohol is gone
Neighbors saying that they're going to call the law
I ain't tripping on that blasé blah
Playing music loud as fuck and the house is a cloud of smoke
These hoes be showing titties like they been at Mardis Gras
Her song came on I guess that's when her bra came off
We gon' party all night like we got insomnia
Red cups in hand, some got spilled, I'm on tilt my eyes on slant
Lightweight drinkers they don't stand a chance
They're about to make a crash landing, trying to keep up with me Going shot for shot is not the move
My tolerance is through the roof I'm like a champion
Shot king wanna hang out bring a bottle of some Crown Royal
Bout' to go whole ham, oh man I'm

[Hook]

[Bridge]

[Verse 3]
Nothing better than a bottle you just bought off the shelf
And you see the logo with the golden crown that sits on the pillow
You run your fingernail across the sticker right in the middle
And take the bottle out the bag and save the baggy for later
Maybe to put your weed inside or hide your jewelry or paper
You make a mixer with some soda or you shootin it straight up
With the reserve or the black or maple original flavor
You know that shit is my favorite, no other whiskey is player
Like that Crown

[Outro]
They know I'm sippin' on that
They know I'm sippin' on that
They know I'm sippin' on that
