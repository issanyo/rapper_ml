[Verse One]
Got a deal but I'm still broke mad as fuck
The money comin' shit ain't addin up
Drunk, feelin' like fuckin some rappers up
I don't give a fuck what they said they [?]
Scavenger, haven't ya heard about me I'm the captain of
The Cli-N-Tel clique, North-side Atlanta bruh
I drink a fifth of Crown and snort a gram of Pamela
Then pop up on you like an episode of [?]
You talk a ton of shit on Twitter just cuz I ain't answer ya
Don't mean I didn't see it
Now I'm in your city and you act like you a fan of my
Music cuz you scared I might flip and put my hands on ya
Say you got your hammer cocked but you ain't never shot nothin'
You just cannot stop runnin' your cock-suckin mouth, frontin', you 'bout nothin
Your music shitty too, I end up hittin the stop button
Soon as I hear you talk, You think you snap and you not bussin
I'm under appreciated ahead of my time
Never blew up, always been on a steady incline
And I don't care, Underground or big name
EP, mixtape, nobody album better than mine
If I was you I'd spend another six seconds on Vine
And make a video smokin' instead of tryin' to rap
This is a diss to everybody spittin' recycled trash
Try me I'm a psyhcopath, and I'm dyin' to snap on a BITCH

Yeah motherfucker, keep on fuckin' playin with me, keep on fuckin' playin with me man
I'll finger fuck the shit out your girlfriend, I'll fuck her in the ass with a dry dick
I'll fuck her mouth, I'll fish hook her fuckin' mouth and fuck her throat you fuckin' bitch

[Verse 2]
Yeah!
Shit I ain't never heard of y'all
Never seen you in the XXL, the Source, or MURDER DOG
But Tech told me to kill em, so I'm just followin' protocol
Wish dominance over all, cuz I was out workin hard, but y'all was just jerkin off
Expectin' shit to fall in your lap, I'm just gettin' started, far from the curtain call
While [?]
I'm sick but the terminal illness, realness and I'm gonna milk this
Game, for what it's worth I got the world on my dilznik
They say my music is a bad influence to lil' kids
Well discipline your kids you lil' bitch
I'll take some methamphetamine and crush it to lil' bits
And snort it up my nose right now if I want to..
*snort*Uhh..*snort* Fuck yeah.. Uhh
Same person that I am on TV
Frustratin' other rappers cuz they cannot see me
What I say I really do, they just good at actin' gangster lames
These rap game James Gandolfinis, I got em trampolining like Bruno Sammartini
They bout to say I'm legendary, they can hear it in my first song
Push play homie puff until the herbs gone
It's Rittz in this bitch DJ Burn One
Yah-uh Yeah
