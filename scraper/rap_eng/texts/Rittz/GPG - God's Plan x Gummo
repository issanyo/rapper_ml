[Verse 1]
I'm wishin' that someone would take this pistol from me
But I'm all alone inside my crib, I've written some things
On a note, I hope they read it and eventually see
When I'm dead and gone they'll finally appreciate me
I guess I gotta die for them to miss me
I go online and see that they've been dissing on me
They pissed 'cause I don't call 'em when they text me
I'm a raging alcoholic, I'm addicted to speed

If this is God's plan, God damn
All the folks that I call fam
Got hands out, tryna get some money from me, I lend
Out so much and I wanna give them more to help but I can't
Nothing inside my bank account, my pocket's full of balled lint
My fans don't understand the industry, if they caught wind
How this shit really work, they'd finally see why shit did not pan
Out, I got [?] stuck inside, just watched my claw print
Carved in the wood from struggling inside this coffin

Bad things, looking at my classmates
Wishin' I was born like them and all I made was bad grades
Didn't graduate, mom and dad praised
My siblings, but I'm sitting in my bat cave
With the strap aimed
At my temple, trying to end the show
Can't write, it's like my pencil broke
My wife just tried to slit her throat
I'm looking at pics she sent my phone
I'm crying while the intro song is playing
And the tears are rolling down my face
Can't cancel, though, I wrote the fucking cancer song
To give some hope and shed light, to fight the shit instead of dying
I'd trade so they could live their life, 'cause I just take for granted mine
Don't see no speed limit signs, most people think I'm living my
Dream so I can see why they don't understand or empathize
If I was 26 then I'd be cool with time just ticking by
This ain't what I visualized when I was washing dishes, I
Figured I would get to sign a deal and count them dollar signs
Instead of followers online and poppin' xanny bars like imma
OD, feelin' like I'm snow skiing, every dollar got a coke ding
It's a [code 3?]
Hit the lights before I sniff a line, I know it's gon' sting
Puttin' holes inside my nostrils like I got a nose ring
Curtains closing on me, man I heard a ghost speak
Telling me that I was chose to tell my story, don't leave
Go lean on your fans that are lost and lock hands
Even when you at the bottom, let them know there's options
This is God's plan

[Verse 2]
CNT official, hoe
Independent business on the give and go
Stones inside my emblem glow and glisten like a disco ball
Figuring inside the strobe lights invite this pigeon-toed
Bitch to show me tricks, she treats my dick like it's a stripper pole
Benjamins you [cannot fold]? to fit up in this envelope
They say we should hit the road but they don't sell no tickets though
Spittin' like I'm dipped in [?] but this is slow, I switched the flow
Tryna make a record 'cause homies that are wishin' me the best I put and enter to your energy
I'm finishing the enemy to Hennessey is mixed with coke
Not my dream but when in Rome I'mma give a toast to the friends that rode and we kicked in doors till the hinges broke
Went and did them shows when we didn't have dough
Tried to get back home on the [?] flow
When the cops came, nickel say, "Quick, 5-0"
I would smoke and forget where I hid my dope
Then get suited up, like I was got that two-liter saluted, bruh
Scoopin' up that ice cream like a 19-year-old in a [bruiser's?] car
Can't even flirt with a girl anymore, hard to tell what they'll accuse you of
Saying I forced you to screw me, what?
All I said, "If you don't get this movie part
You can always get a job at the booty club, you cute" and that's a compli-
Ment that I meant from the heart, later on this bitch is all on top of
Me but I'm way to big to try to have sex in a Hyundai Elantra
But instead she just gave me head, well if she don't swallow I'mma lick cum on the console
Uh, uh, wet your tongue, nah, need to be calm, strong
Busted a load and dumped her like I'm driving in a dump truck
Don Juan eatin' Mongolian beef and wonton
Dumplings, high, it's munchy time, my eyes look like a Vermont [con?]
Rockstar like I'm Post Malone and 21
Some of them come hard from the john
Summer come, bubble gum, kinda want a number one hit, better get your Spotify numbers up
Sticking out like a sore thumb in the industry, some disease in the history lesson
Or a listening session, I can smell pussy like I'm in the women's restroom
What, you miss your menstrual schedule? What, you [lay in pee and resting?]?
Take your shit, put it in your [?] and put it in, ain't no BMXes
Take it, flip it, reinvest it, I might buy a studio
I might blow some stupid dough and spend it all in a jewelry store
You just don't look cute, so one of your fake diamonds in a ruby stone
Fake Gucci skully, Gucci clothing, Gucci shoes, and Gucci clone
Tripping like some [?], honey gripping that Coolio
And fuck anyone who don't approve, it's CNT the movement, hoe
It's Rittz, bitch
