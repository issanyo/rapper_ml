[Rittz: Verse 1]

Yeah
Re-re mix
Yeah
I'm on
Three shots of whatever
Three shots of whatever
Jaegermeister, Jameson, and Flaming Dr. Pepper
That'll start me off correct I
Really don't suggest ya'
Disrespect us dog I'm drunk who standing in my spot I'm next ta'
Bet ya'
Never heard of me but you about to find out
I was in a hole but Yela' helped me climb out
I'm back and now these rappers gotta sit in timeout
Coming from Atalanta baby give a pimp a wipe down
Where your girlfriend at I got her in a night gown
Going down on my pipe like wow
I'm bout to bust one here dear swallow my child
While I blow white clouds of some high priced loud
We can fist fight like like like lights out
Pull a knife get sliced right by your eye brow
We gone like ciao
See ya' later bye now
Where the fuck is my Crown
We ain't drinking Icehouse
Slumerian the crew I rep and I vow
To clean house rappers whose buzz has died down
My styles unorthodox
No discriminating pussy take Porsche Foxx
And get Courtney Cox to go raw
Get a phone call saying I'm the baby daddy na' surely not
I'm on fire you more like sorta hot
I'm high like its twenty past four o'clock
You better try to secure your spot
You can't ignore this bitch I got em' sweating like they're shitting in a porta-John
Rap Mortal Kombat
Get folded like origami
I was bored and lonely
Last year this year I was touring boning
Any girl that want a penis like I'm organ doning
That line probably gonna make my chick get mad
It's sad trying to rap pussy whipped this bad
This bitch ass game ain't ready for me white kids said they never nobody spit this rad
What is this mishap
Who let him get past
While I sit back watch em' with my feet kicked up
Down three more shot then I take a deep breath bout to kill it when the beat switch up
Your girl want me to autograph her titty at a show
I told her we back at the Marriot she wanna go
I said that she coming and bring her friend and them with her she gotta fuck the whole posse and when it's over adios
Who you know that's fucking with me anybody even close
When I said it to em' they was looking like they seen a ghost
Claiming that they wanna travel all around the globe
But I still rep 770 they call me Rittz bitch.... White Jesus
