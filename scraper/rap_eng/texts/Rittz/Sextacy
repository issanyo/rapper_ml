[Intro]
It's been a while since we popped some pills and shit
I'mma get freaky tonight
Ya-uh-yeah, it's something beautiful
Yeah

[Verse 1]
Me and you pop a couple E pills, we chill in the bed, just talking
Both of us look lost in each other's eyes, getting high, drinking [?]
We be laughing 'bout how much you gonna [?]
God, it's been a long time since I first laid eyes on you, I was lucky i see
That you look like a British princess
If looks could kill, I'd already be dead
Now we laying in the bed and the stress and the troubles of the world don't exist
Only us right here, as I pull my fingers through your blonde hair
Playing round with your pussy, pussy, down here
God damn, I can feel this pills start kicking in, stop reminiscing and
Started getting into me, started tongue kissing hard, I'm intense and I feel my skin tingling
When she run her fingertips down my chest and began to undo my belt
Then I undid hers, I'm about to make a meal
Like a fine dude, God, you're beautiful as her
Like a Goddess, here, let me give you a massage, just chill
Let the baby oil spill, on your skin, let the sextivity begin
Cause it feels like

[Hook]
Esctasy when I'm next to you
It feels like everything is cool
It feels like esctasy when I'm sexing you
It feels like everything is cool

[Verse 2]
Now we feel fresh, freaky and picking on that E, I'm in raising hell
Fucking you like I just got released from jail
Bet the neighbors know my name, I make you moan and yell
Louder and harder then I'm pulling on your ponytail
Pull it out here, taste it, that's you, don't you taste great baby, and she ain't afraid to take it
Anywhere I wanna place it, nothing like sex on the X, it's [?] faces
Hey, let's take it to the shower
Me and her are down to the shit that other freaks won't do
We must be geeked up cause you peed on me, I peed on you
Let me [?] to the wet towels and the mattress
Started kissing, ain't no kissing you in black dress
Then I said let's fuck outside, been a while since we had sex on the back deck
Covering your mouth, a couple crickets in your yard
I can see headlights, fuckers in the cars
All they gonna see is figures fucking in the dark
Rolling on the E pills underneath the stars
And it's back to the room, think I'm bout to bust real soon
Boom, shot it to the moon
All over your grill, swallow daddy's girl
Then she said it feels like

[Hook]

[Outro]
Now it's time for a round two
