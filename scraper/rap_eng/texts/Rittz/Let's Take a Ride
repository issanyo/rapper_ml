Potluck! Yeah...

[Verse 1 - UnderRated]
Cocaine in the brain, turned a plains jane
To a vane dame, when I hang, let her maintain
Fucking with us trust, you wanna do the same thang
Back of the bus sluts, they must get gang banged
We in the middle of the boondocks, bumpin a boombox
She wants to come and roll a lotta moon rocks
No sleep eyes black like a raccoon
Got her in the back, tryna smash in the bathroom
Coke for the pound, coke for the nose dive, time for some action, we both doin blow
She don't wanna smoke, she don't like a reaction
But I do it all, call me Bo Jackson
Gimme the blunt, we doin dabs all day too
I ain't no punk, and ain't nobody gon' play you
Or play me, I ain't the same lately, a drug snortin cowboy go crazy
Loosen up, hallucinate, so close to overdose, that I'm blue in the face
Got a girl with some ass watch her masturbate
Clibatin' every day until I pass away
All my people on my team scream yay for the yayo
Pure MDMA is in my nasal
[?] like to be hotbox the Winnebago
She don't like the yayo but she'll do it if I say so
Get her kitty on the table
Take her to the bed head spinnin' like a dradle
Winnin' and sinnin' and I'm a do it all day though
Bob Marley spittin' like I'm in a volcano
The night's never gon' end, if she's fallin' asleep then I'm fuckin' her friend
Grinding my teeth feeling so sublime
And I think I'm gonna do another line

[Hook]
C'mon
Let's take a ride, let's step over that line
Push it to the limit, do a bump and be fine
(I puff a J, I'm sippin' lean, come roll with me, see what I mean) 2x
C'mon
Let's take a ride, let's step over that line
Push it to the limit, do a bump and be fine
(I'm climbin' high, unto the sky, to see what I can find
I blow my mind, I'm out my mind, I'm feelin' so fly)

[Verse 2 - Rittz]
This scene always seem like a re-run
Take a shot up out a bottle then it's followed with a key bump
Doin' em and now my teeth numb
Wanna come and chill with us up on the woods you gotta bring some
Now the party begun, Cheech you better be Slum
Coke will even out the alcohol so I don't seem drunk
If it ain't good enough I'm gonna need a refund
Potluck got it, ain't no need to make a weed run
Life is like a scene from Scarface
Heart racing, like a middle in a car chase
Shark face, got the crooked mouth, it's hard to talk straight
Headed to a dark place, I think I need to eat a Xani bar, wait!
I don't wanna eat it though, I would rather crush it up
Two hoes love me, R. Kelly bout to (double up)
One got titties, but the other got a (bubble butt)
Bust it on a bitch's stomach now she got a (puddle of)
Love on her belly button, baby clean your tummy up
Coke, we're in love, I'm bout to cut and set another one
Hit me instantly, I could have went and did a somersault
Chilling with me, guaranteed there's gonna be some drugs involved
Walking on air (?) Js and we party everyday like it's Mardi Gras
Maybe I can fill ways to ignite a buzz
Potluck and Rittz bitch you wanna come with us, let's ride!

[Hook]

[Verse 3 - 1 Ton]
Everyday I start my morning with a wake and bake
A Bloody Mary or a Vodka and OJ
The best way to a fight a hangover the next day
Is start the next party, first thing, right away
Dig it out with a bump and some coffee
Mushroom trippin', puffin' up our weed
Pop a molly, drink a long island iced tea
I need a chick who love to do drugs like me
4:20 on the clock, getting high
Puffed with the damn keys facin' up in the parking lot
Marijuana 'til I drop, eating edibles in the ride on the way to the next party spot
She love my type, and all damn night wanna hold my pipe
All fucked up and she's doing me right
Bottles pop, bitch drop her right
Rock star life, I be going like a machine
I Rick James, Hefner, Charlie Sheen
Off the chain, I'm sippin' lean
Come roll with me, see what I mean
Go hard or go home, taking shots to the dome
Pop pills, want a (clone?) of the green
When I'm in the zone, I hit Humboldt home grown getting so-so stoned from the weed
Better come by, we on the (?)
Hella high, rollin' out to the dark side
Never tongue tied, I'm getting it done right
She wanna try to be part of my love life
From the sunset to the sunrise
I'm a poke Visine in my eyes
Been a cool cat and I got nine lives
Tryna do dabs and I feel so fly

[Hook]
