[Verse 1]
Yu-Uh-Yeah
Look
If you ain’t in my circle I ain’t got no trust in you
You a lame, using slang I ain’t accustomed to
Saying what the fuck I do
Like when a lady wake up naked in the bed
Laying next to Dr. Huxtable
What you uncomfortable? Wonderful, smoke with one apple
I hit a blunt with you then go and crush a box of Lunchable’s
A Smucker’s Uncrustables and a couple pack of Gusher’s
Bust a bag of Ruffles open, start a crackin' Dutches
Let the guts fall out, y’all can shut y'all mouth
But y'all can suck it out in public saying fuck all out
What that embarrass you?
With no comparison or similarities with me
And who is in the mirror that you stare into (That's you)
I’m pimping bitches why you scaring them like man this dude
Experimenting with ‘em let ‘em share ‘em while the cameras shoot
They need a director’s chair, you’re repping the censored ,yeah
An ode to C-N-T is deep connected like checkered square
Giuseppes and Natty’s and I just bought me a fresher pair
My guess is you would step into some Sketcher’s I’d never wear
No sense of style, I went to Fifth’s and I was in and out
With stacks of cash so massive it could be a risk to count
My pockets fat ain’t been no slimming down
Only getting fatter like a bitch done had an infant child that sits around
And you could say that I’m harsh, say my flavor is posh
I say that you ain’t getting paper, no más
You a hater and I think I know why
'Cause I be taking long vacations in locations where they say Aloha
And having luaus, a mansion with a pool house
With you down bass
Sleeping on couches that expand into a pull-out
Broke in Neiman Marcus seen him glancing at the shoe aisle
But you ain’t got no money, you just flex like you do
Your rep is questionable, in fact you’re destined to lose
You ever test me, get me deadly, that’s inevitable
You on a stretcher with a medical crew, rescuing you
'Cause I decked you I ain’t testing no new wresting move
Suplexing dude, you would look fresh with a blue vest on
Working the Crawlmart, did you check the dude’s restroom?
Get the carts from the lot? Get a carpenter job
Or lay some carpet. Ever thought of giving Arby’s a shot?
Just not rapping acting like your bars are hard when they’re not
Honest to God they couldn’t market the garbage you got

[Hook]
You say the shit that you’re about to regret (Motherfucker)
That’s why you never get one ounce of respect
You messed up and stepped in a pile of deep shit
I think it’s time to get your reality checked
Check one, two
Check one, two
One, Two

[Verse 2]
They say I murder shit and I just say affirmative
I just write what I observe like I’m a journalist, I'm merciless
My purpose ain’t to further your encouragement of surfacing
I heard your shit, your verses need refurbishing
But let’s be honest we done thought we heard the worst but then a trend emerges with a surge, the words just reoccur again
Is that a her or him? I work my pen so much it hurts my hand
Like when you fingering a bitch to make her squirt and can’t
Her meat curtains look like turkey skin, screaming lord have mercy like I witnessed bitches twerking at a church event
And I’ve done fucked in church before don’t judge me for it
I’m sure the lord above forgave me, maybe understood the circumstance that I was in
I was in and out of consciousness
A constant itch to put a straw up in my nostril, hit the soft and sniffed
Confidence was lost I used to say I was incompetent, but now I’m balling hanging off the rim like David Robinson
Bought my bitch exotic whips, ain’t no S&M
A lot of artists getting played, ain’t no record spin
A lot of trends are getting dated, like leopard print
For years I watched the game and waited, but sat the bench
You convinced about it like you could do it like I did
Signed a deal at thirty-two, but still doing you in the process
Maybe I made it look easy, admit it, there isn't a stake in it making it feasible, they should have taken a breather instead of believing the people they keeping around and they lie
But really I’m a good guy, and I just stood by
But this is getting silly, good try
It’s time to quit but you’re delusional as usual
So you just go and hate on me online, but I’ve been on the look out

[Hook]
You say the shit that you’re about to regret (Motherfucker)
That’s why you never get one ounce of respect
You messed up and stepped in a pile of deep shit
I think it’s time to get your reality checked
Check one, two
Check one, two
One, Two
