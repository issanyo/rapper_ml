[Verse 1:]
People all in my business
Talk about me online
Homies saying I'm changing
Calling me on my downtime
I can't pick up my phone because I just got home
And I've been gone two months my time is spent
I got a fiance take a while to adjust being home then I'm gone again
How the fuck you know how much money's in
My bank account, its funny the assumption made
Crumbs don't become a cake overnight
On the road for over fifty-something days
And I still can't post a GoFundMe page
Without a dumbass telling me, "You got it, Rittz"
So many hands in my pocket
I feel like the cops are frisking me looking for my dollar bills
I took 'em so low on the OD tour, lost like fifty-five grand
Lesson learned, I can't afford to bust shit
I told my girl we gotta cancel our plans
And I went off on a tangent
A wreck, cause I'm panicking
Life as a rambling man disappearing
And I'm damned and I can see they can't get a handle of saying it
But do it for my handful of fans
And I still ain't changed

(Simultaneous with hook:)
Never
It's Rittz, bitch

[Hook:]
People change and I don't know why
Cause I'm still the same old me
Aw yeah
Money come and go, but so what?
I'm still the same old me
Aw yeah, aw yeah

[Verse 2:]
Look, might've seen me on a poster or the grocery store
People that are scared to approach me are
No different than me
I write raps for a living and I'm overjoyed
And even if I get no awards for my music
Fans say it helped them cope before
Made 'em hope for more
Sometimes the sky can seem so out of reach
When you're sitting on the ocean floor
I did Breakfast with Sway
On Shade 45 with Heather B
You can see the YouTube video
Where the mic fell, shit was embarrassing
Did a song with Trae the Truth
I met Devin the Dude
And man, I just did a video with Twista
Shit I - think somebody needa pinch my - arm
Here, lets take a picture for the Insta - gram
This is Famous fam with no Travis Barker
Tagging "Rittz Bitch" with a magic marker
The Agora Theater in Cleveland to Phoenix
It's like I'm on a magic carpet
Shit I'm dreaming a bit
Sold out shows, I was up in the arena with Tech
Then I flew back home to Atlanta, did a show for my homie
Only 25 people was there, but I rocked that bitch

(Simultaneous with hook:)
Cause I still ain't changed
It's Rittz, bitch

[Hook:]
People change and I don't know why
Cause I'm still the same old me
Aw yeah
Money come and go, but so what?
I'm still the same old me
Aw yeah, aw yeah

[Verse 3:]
One time for the dreamers
I pray your day will soon come
It's hard to know what you here for
It'll reveal itself in due time
I rap with friends who ain't made it
Let your lyrics channel through mine
Two times for the fans that motivated me the minute I started to lose sight
They be showing up in each, state
Fans overseas saying peace, mate
They loving the lyrics because they re-late
They give me the motivation to cre-ate
When I'm fettered it gets hard for me to see, straight
To my family I used to be a di-sgrace
The time I'm spending rapping was a big, waste
But I finally got a record deal a big, break
Time to be, great
Homie we, chase
The paper til the muscles in our feet, ache
And finally I got to have a sweet, taste
Of victory, picture me rolling with the homies C-N-T, mane
Everybody in the world wanna de-bate
Who's better Meek, Drake?
I'm just hoping that I reach, they
Level, went back-to-back-to-back
Haters saying he, changed

(Simultaneous with hook:)
Like really?
Ain't shit changed
I still live in Gwinnett
Still got the same homies
Clintel
I ain't rich, bitch
I'm Rittz, bitch
Yeah

[Hook:]
People change and I don't know why
Cause I'm still the same old me
Aw yeah
Money come and go, but so what?
I'm still the same old me
Aw yeah, aw yeah
