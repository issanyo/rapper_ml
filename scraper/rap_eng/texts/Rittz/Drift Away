[Verse 1]
My dodge charger like a starship
Smokin' and I'm floatin' like I'm on a magic carpet
Eat a xany bar and I chase it with captain Morgan
I hit the night life, so I can see what's on the market
See me tippin' out the darkness, lookin' sharp
It's a feature when the speakers like so much I play the organ
Take 'em to church, give 'em the works, with every verse
I spit I put my heart in and my hand is like a shark's fit
I'm bad like a white LL, homie, I'm I-L-L
I put some purple off inside my L
I wish that you could see how high I feel
You wanna drink, you got the right idea
So here's to another lifetime, cheers
Hundred dollar bills will help me dry my tears
Sayonara, see you later haters, bye-bye fear
I ain't switched and went Hollywood homie I'm right here
Without y'all or nothin', got the latest fillet
Maybe it's the taste of music and the way we was raised
Or the fact that we was trappin' found a way to escape
Through rap music, and thats beautiful ain't it today
I woke up and saw the sun sky high like it's g mo b
Prayin' everyday to G.O.D
Thankin' him for every single thing I G.O.T
Now follow me and we can all go to the T.O.P

[Hook]
I said, come with me, we can drift away
Some-sometimes life can be in disarray
So anyone who wanna come participate
We can all get high together, we can drift away
I said, come with me we can drift away
Sometimes life can be in disarray
So anyone who wanna come participate
We can all get high together, we can drift away
Now let's go, oh-oh-oh-oh
Roll it up, let's go, oh-oh-oh-oh

(Reverse Talk)

[Verse 2]
We could be on top of the world like 8 ball and MJG, shit
Seemed way more simple in them days
I try to restore the feelin' by chiefing some weed
My speakers beating like a drummer when they playing the djembe
Scarface, Outkast, Biggie and Eminem was my Sensei
I listened and I polished my skills, for years
I steal the will to make it up hills and valleys
And now it's finally time for me to make an imprint date
Ready? I hope I'm ready too I'm sick of being hypothetical
When talkin' 'bout makin' it, it's pathetic shit
I'm 32 the years in the struggle is unforgettable
You got a dream, I hope you live to see it comin' true
Feelin' like I was unconscious finally comin' to
Either that or the negativity's out of view
Looking at living now from a different altitude
It's shocking this positivity shit is powerful
High as fuck, head in the clouds I'm sittin' powder blue
And it great no more and the same goes for
My future finally lookin' brighter and ain't it great homeboy
Me and my homies gettin' paper like a Staples store
Woke up this morning saw the sun sky high like it's g mo b
Prayin' everyday to G.O.D
Thankin' him for every single thing I G.O.T
Now follow me and we can all go to the T.O.P
