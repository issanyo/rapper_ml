[Verse 1]
Mom and Dad split up when she was just a kid, she lost all her trust, her trust in relationships, the unfaithfulness;
It was a shame
Both of them cheated, leaving her a non-believer in falling in love
She was jaded since day one, looking for someone to blame
She never really had shit, she don't give a fuck about how much you got, she don't care if it's a little or a lot, no matter what she bought
She was lied to so many times by guys in disguise, trying to be something they not
I kept it real so I'm hoping that she'll let me get a shot
I told her I ain't gon' try to fill her head up with fairytales
And I know that she was scared as hell
You let your guard down so  you gotta wear a shell
Cause every male that ever said it was gonna be forever bailed
Her pops left out the door so fast like a jetpack was on his back
Got abused by her step-dad, the only way to get attention was a sex act
Momma never taught her to respect herself
She had to learn on her own, had a lot of obstacles, and barriers that herd her along
Beneath the surface was a girl in search of true love, she's a queen that deserves to be crowned
And I can recall the first time I seen her, I was in awe
It was like I had a crystal ball, it was her and I
And I ain't tryna say you about to have the perfect life because I heard goodbye girl

[Hook]
Cause I'm gon' be your knight in shining armor
And everything will be okay
Together we gon' fight through all your problems
Until they all go away
Cause I'm gon' be your knight in shining armor
And everything will be okay
And you can find me right beside my woman
She's the one, she's my soulmate

[Verse 2]
We both used to be heavy into drugs, until we finally got each other clean
Used to fuck on a hand-me down twin bed, now we make love on a California King
Had to share a car, working double shifts, Christmas came around, couldn't buy each other gifts
Summertime couldn't turn on the A/C, Fan's blowin in our face while we eating frozen fish
Had to go and pretend like we had our own place
Saving up to stay up in a cheap motel
Now we got a two car garage, three cars, a big house, paying bills we don't need no help
65 inch T.V., she don't care about no money, she just love me, and I feel the same for her
Told her she don't gotta work, kick your feet up
She's just about to get the life she deserve

[Hook]
Cause I'm gon' be your knight in shining armor
And everything will be okay
Together we gon' fight through all your problems
Until they all go away
Cause I'm gon' be your knight in shining armor
And everything will be okay
And you can find me right beside my woman
She's the one, she's my soulmate

[Verse 3]

Cause even when the times got hard we were always laughing
Even if we were single, nobody else is gonna have us
We're both so crazy, 10 years in never lost attraction
And there's gotta be a god cause he crossed our paths when we were lost and had it with the dating game
I pulled a David Blaine inside the bed, never lost the magic
Got her dripping like I took her white water rafting
And I know there's gonna be some people that'll hear the song and trash it, I don't really give a fuck what they say
As a rapper you really ain't supposed to act like you in love
Fuck 'em they don't even gotta hit play
Fuck touring, fuck music, fuck money, fuck the internet, and anything that gets in the way
Even her friends and family members' opinions don't matter
Cause it's only me and you at the end of the day, and just know that:

[Bridge]
I'll run through flames to rescue you
There's nothing I would rather do
Than be next to you

[Hook]
Cause I'm gon' be your knight in shining armor
And everything will be okay
Together we gon' fight through all your problems
Until they all go away
Cause I'm gon' be your knight in shining armor
And everything will be okay
And you can find me right beside my woman
She's the one, she's my soulmate
