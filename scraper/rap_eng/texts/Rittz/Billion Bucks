[Intro: Jarren Benton]
Jarren Benton
Kato on the track, bitch
Uh, that rapper named Rittz, bitch
White Jesus in this hoe
Let 'em know I say

[Chorus: Jarren Benton]
Woke up and I feel just like a billion bucks
Billion bucks, billion bucks
They gon' hate, but we don't give a billion fucks
Billion fucks, billion fucks
I'm in VIP, I'm with a billion sluts
Billion sluts, billion sluts
Every day I feel just like a billion bucks
Billion bucks, billion bucks

[Verse 1: Jarren Benton]
Uno, dos, tres, leggo
Y'all sucka ass niggas soft like Jell-O
Pull up in the Trans-Am, nose on the whole gram
Of the white girl nigga, Jay Othello
Kick a nigga door for the k-i-l-o
Blunt full of kush make a nigga feel mellow
Sayonara to the bad guy to the .45 in the SK muthafucka say hello
Hello, hi, me I'm high, mesmerized by neon lights
Bitch you know I'm throwed off, doctor said I'm not right
Got a white bitch but shes not bright
If the bitch'll blow a nigga for his Snickers then imagine
What the hoe would do for a Klondike!
Feelin' like a billion
And then I'm about to kill again
He's on his own island bet them niggas think I'm Gilligan
No resilience I'll pop a nigga, drop a nigga Heath Ledger nigga
I'ma pop a little pill again
What up to my homie Ned Fresh up out the pen again
I shove a muthafucka's head right inside the ceiling fan
Leave a pussy nigga shaking in his Timberlands
D-d-d-d stuttering and tr-tr-tr-tr-trembling
Wake up feeling like a billion bucks
Bitch get to steppin' if you don't fuck
I need a ho to give me futuristic head
Blow me in the space ship, call the bitch, Aeon Flux
Fall off in the club with the heat on tuck
This my year, y'all peons suck
Gone off that Charlie Sheen, that tiger blood, bitch we goin' nuts like

[Chorus: Jarren Benton]
Woke up and I feel just like a billion bucks
Billion bucks, billion bucks
They gon' hate, but we don't give a billion fucks
Billion fucks, billion fucks
I'm in VIP, I'm with a billion sluts
Billion sluts, billion sluts
Every day I feel just like a billion bucks
Billion bucks, billion bucks

[Verse 2: Rittz]
Okay Jarren, dog I know they scared
When they see me and you together man it's so unfair
The way we killin' these rappers I bet there's no comparin'
Not a fan of they music, I hate the clothes they wearin'
And I'm so embarrassed, at the state of my city
Cause everybody rep they hood in the white boy spot
But when they really in the hood, try and tell 'em where they from
They be lookin' at 'em like, "Boy, stop!"
But not me, I'm from the north side, feeling like a billion
I'm a Slumerican, honkey-town affiliate
I’m with a Brazilian, bitch who let me drill her
Afterwards she call me up and say she never wanna chill again
It's too unsafe, my crew untamed, the shit true
My black friends always rob my white friends
My white friends get drunk and start fighting each other
And when they bloody they be like, "Are we tight man?"
And this red light, damn, and this ain’t shock rap
Talk that shit on the internet when I see you
I'ma tuck my hair inside of my sock hat, cock back
And swing at your jaw, SMACK, somebody better tell him to fall back
The southern hip-hop's Josh Koscheck, prob'ly got a weapon in the Octagon
I’ll stomp you while my Jeremy Scotts is on
What you thought, come on, it’s my time man your watch is wrong
I’m gone, I’m on a whole 'nother playing field
My name is still buzzin' the fuckin' streets are watchin'
Rollin' up the Sour Deez in the Cut' Supreme
I could spend this cream in the Neiman Marcus
Lookin' clean, you are steamin' -- heap of garbage
You could scheme, homie I’ma be me regardless
People talk a lot of shit, ‘cause I’m an easy target
Eatin' xani bars, drinkin' Thompson, it got me feelin' like a billion...

[Chorus: Jarren Benton]
Woke up and I feel just like a billion bucks
Billion bucks, billion bucks
They gon' hate, but we don't give a billion fucks
Billion fucks, billion fucks
I'm in VIP, I'm with a billion sluts
Billion sluts, billion sluts
Every day I feel just like a billion bucks
Billion bucks, billion bucks

[Verse 3: Jon Connor]
Flints own, Flintstone, made this buzz on his own
You ain’t on ya grind, but I stay on mine
So what y'all do? Piss, moan
Y'all niggas real fake, my nigga's Bill Gates
Killin' the industry what a difference a year make!
I’m here for your ear sake, you wanna hear great?
You fuck outta luck, I can hear the mirror break
You niggas so basic -- fly
The 'Stairway to Heaven' yo it lead to my basement
Based in the fucking basement it’s amazing
The Matrix that I haze 'em can't save ‘em
Hits give ‘em Canseco on site, I’m a psycho when I write tho like a rifle
Took all of my rivals, I swear that I bless every track (yup)
Hand on the Bible
Backyard, H squad
I came out the hood nigga just like y’all
Love how I stand on my own two feet
But the haters they pray that I just might fall
Nah, never that, I drop classics, nigga, gimme that
See how my name buzz on the internet
If it’s me against the world then I’m winning that
See? Look, my niggas struggle like five in the bank
You bullshittin' like five in the tank
See I, grind for mine, I earn my shine
So I ain’t got another nigga to thank
Moe Cleaves gave me game at a young age
Say niggas only read what's on the front page
And I know that’s true, so he looked me in my eye and say
"Do what you gotta do to make sure that’s you!" Connor...

[Chorus: Jarren Benton]
Woke up and I feel just like a billion bucks
Billion bucks, billion bucks
They gon' hate, but we don't give a billion fucks
Billion fucks, billion fucks
I'm in VIP, I'm with a billion sluts
Billion sluts, billion sluts
Every day I feel just like a billion bucks
Billion bucks, billion bucks
