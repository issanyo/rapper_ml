[Verse 1: Rittz]
Let me tell you a story
Yeah, well let me tell you about Kesha and DERON
Kesha was afraid OF getting cheated on, he was always gone
One day she was peeking through his phone
Saw a couple texts about sex DIDN'T KNOW WHO THEY WERE FROM
She just tried to play dumb
The following Friday, he said he's gonna kick it with his boys at the drive way
She hopped inside her Honda and followed him
I'D A, paranoid if I was him
But he ain't see her follow him, behind him when he PULLED into the parking lot
Met this white girl, Kesha's jaw just dropped
When he kissed her and he piNched her LITTLE ass right in front of her
Kesha started crying, she just couldn't stomach THE THOUGHT OF HER FIANCE underneath the sheets
FuckIN SOMEONE ELSE pulled a gun from underneath the seat OF THE CAR
SCREAMED "DERON how you gonna do me like this?
You wanna leave me to SCREW this stupid white chick?"
She said, "who are, you?"
"I'm his future wife bitch, Kesha BLACKED OUT HER PUPILS LOOKIN HUGE AND lifeless
She pulled the trigger, shot the bitch in the head
Shot DERON and she CRIED while he bled
All she said was...

He don't love me, love me
He don't love me anymore
Don't love me, love me
Not the way he did before

[Verse 2: Rittz]
Well let me tell you about Cindy and Todd
Todd got Cindy pregnant so they moved in together to start
A happy family but everything is falling apart
They always arguing cause Todd is partying hard
He's got a credit card again so he could save his cash
Spend hers on the gas SPEND HIS ON A BAG OF SOME ICE plus he stay up all night on mother's day
HE HAD A STORY CINDY SURE HE'S HITTIN USHER LATE
She's crying, why you choose the drugs over me
Every night you either GEEKED up, drunk, or smokeIN' weed
How we the fuck we supposed to be decent parents when the baby comes
You ain't EVER HOME I'M ALREADY RAISIN' ONE
But
She know better, she's what you call a CUTTER
When she's depressed, she goes in to the bathroom CUPBOARD AND TAKES A BOX CUTTER SCRAPES HER ARMS TILL THEY BLEED
No wonder in the summer she was wearing long sleeves
ALL SHE REALLY WANTS IS A MAN OFF SPEED
"GOD PLEASE" SHE WAS SCREAMIN CARVIN IN HER PALMS CREASE
Bloodstains on THE CARPET
Scars on her thighs, all she does is sit in her apartment and cry like "why?..."

[Hook]
He don't love me, love me
He don't love me anymore
Don't love me, love me
Not the way he did before

[Verse 3: Rittz]

And starts to feel guilty bout the father he's become

WANTS TO try to work on his marriage, first he got it break it off
With Joann, when THEY HAD THAT phone call
She just lost it, she said, "your love is all I needED, it was god sent
It's all I ever wanted, I can't live without it
You wanna live without me, I just won't allow it"
The next night at 11:34 PM, she just went and broke in DevIn's door
Creeped up the stairCASE to his daughter's room
Neighbors said all YOU heard, was a loud boom
AND she shot his son TOO laying in the BUNK bed
Dude on the news said it was a blood shed
DEVIN'S RUNNIN DOWN THE HALL THEN YOU HEARD A GUN GO OFF THEN YOU HEARD SOMEBODY FALL
