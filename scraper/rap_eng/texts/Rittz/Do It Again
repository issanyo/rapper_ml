[Hook]
I fuck shit up, then I do it again
Sorry, not sorry, I do it again
Take one shot then I do it again
Come tomorrow, Ima do it again
Come tomorrow, Ima do it again

[Verse 1: Whitney Peyton]
Go ape then I do it again
I don't give a damn what kinda crew that you in
Showin' up to parties uninvited, drinkin' liquor
While they're lookin' at me like "uh, who let you in?"
Smash cake then I steal the pinata
Fill it with vodka, medulla oblongata
Split and I give em these stars like Mufasa
Homies I know hufflepuff on the potter
I'm legit a sinner
When I grip the gin, so just admit the winner
Anybody thinkin' any different I'ma come and ninja star your face with a fidget spinner, bitch!
Too hard, too dark
Whitney Peyton, your music is gettin' too harsh!
If you're wonderin' the reason I be schemin'
Haters look in the mirror cause you are, now
Back to the positive vibes
Back to the party and henny on ice
Usin' my name when referring to White Girl
I am too hyphy to ever need lines
My my!
Screwed in the head
My team is hot!
You just pretend
My shit is poppin'
You just in bed
Snap on the mic and then do it again

[Chorus]
I fuck shit up, then I do it again
Sorry, not sorry, I do it again
Take one shot then I do it again
Come tomorrow, Ima do it again
Come tomorrow, Ima do it again

[Verse 2: R.A The Rugged Man]
I fuck shit up
And I do it, again again and again
Wonderin' where the veteran been
I'm better than them
A legend when I pick up the pen
The message I send I do it for real, I never pretend
Better send in your men
He's spittin' venom again
Put 'im on an award show but he never attend!
Maybe I wasn't invited, stupid bitch you could bite it
I got the anger inside of me now the spark is ignited
I stick my dick in the drywall
I kick in your eyeball
They wishin' that I fall
They ready to die, all
I do it, I did it, I did it
Just a little bit I hit it
Didn't want to get me admitted into the clinic
Had to do a little better, had to beat em and burn em
He was the knight of the livin' dead and I needed to learn him
It's real life, not twitter, so you can't block me
And when I rock on the block, roll through with the posse
I spit on a racist and knock out a nazi
Piss on his body like sorry not sorry
Ruthless, Eazy-E
Diggy diggy dock
Punk rock, Iggy Pop
With the city, diddy bop
Put a bullet in the oink oink little piggy cop
West coast, east beef, shook, Diddy, Biggie, Pac
When I shatter the Earth into little pieces and demolish anybody that wasn't capable of seein' the knowledge
When I'm teachin' and preachin', I'm always speakin' Adonis
You little bitches better be ready to be payin' me homage
Let 'em know my little homie Whitney P is a goddess
And anybody fuckin' with her catch a beating I promise
The NYC Apple, the source is rotten
It's a  land where the legends are lost, forgotten
They thought that that'd be crack
Put the battery stack
In the battery pack
(?)

[Chorus]
I fuck shit up, then I do it again
Sorry, not sorry, I do it again
Take one shot then I do it again
Come tomorrow, Ima do it again
Come tomorrow, Ima do it again

[Verse 3: Rittz]
Sorry, not sorry
Like a lady on Maury
They got a baby, accusin' the man that's maybe responsible
For the pregnancy but when they finally read the results
But she was shocked cause the dude she thought that maybe the father was
Negative and he was gon' to roger rabbit the cars
And tell the crowd what they (?)
Then she ran backstage, crying
Kinda reminded me of a groupie
Wantin' in my dressin' room but she can't
Without fuckin' the stage manager
Blowin' the merch guy
Happened the first time, she'd do it again
If you weren't a fan, you probably won't know me
But since I'm sorta famous you be thinkin' maybe you have a chance
Nope
And I can see through 'em like I'm zoomin the lens
On the can with a camera, laughin' in a coupe with the tints
But watch, got some ice cubes and a band
I'm about to pull a Mike Busey show me whatcha gonna do for the gram
They horny like a bull skull and a ram
But we ain't nothin' but mammals
Me and Whitney Peyton just an example
Underdogs comin' up with the handful
Of rappers that we had to trample over
Cause we hustled and gambled
Tryna get to where we are today, I'm chuggin' a handful
Of some Crown Royal chillin' at some industry party
And I don't give a fuck who is, or isn't important
They lookin' at me wrong guarantee some shit'll get started

[Both Whitney and Rittz]
Cause I fuck shit up then I do it again
