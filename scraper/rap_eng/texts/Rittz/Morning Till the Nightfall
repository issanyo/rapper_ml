[Intro: Rittz]
Ya-uh-yeah
I feel so good
Yeah, let's go

[Verse 1: Rittz]
We ain't rockin' no shell toes
Fly Giuseppes, got brimstones on my Velcro
Strapped, lookin' like Michael Jackson walkin'
Don't be mad at me because you let yourself go
My gat too big to let my belt show
(But you got a gold belt on?) Hell no
But these chicks think I'm rich, they be screamin' Rittz when I'm on stage, let me get a Chippendales show
Got real dough, 18 karats on my deed, I see my future clear
Been all around the world here's a souvenir
I'm in Aruba with the coolest scuba gear (you mean scuba gear?)
Yeah homie, dive in, I be in the penthouse in Sydney
Chillin' on the balcony, grillin' out
No more Applebees, eatin' Wafflehouse, or Denny's (what you even havin' for dinner?)
No, I'm so 2017 (right)
Call me Young Johnny, call me Lil' Rittz
Even if I'm broke you could still feel rich
Hundred dollar bills, and the millions, brilliance
Gotta show Brazilians (Rittz keep it real, pimp)
Even when you feel pinned to the ground
Ceilings can be broke through, old school
Gold tooth, shinin' when I'm smiling you can get a little glimpse

[Hook: Rittz]
I went from strugglin' every day to gettin' dough
People said I'd never make it, I should let it go
I was holdin' my convulsion knowin' I was next to blow
Everybody, every day, and we be fresh from head to toe
From mornin' to the nightfall
From the mornin' to the nightfall (aw, yeah)
Mornin' to the nightfall
I'm higher than a fly ball shinin' like a light bulb
From the mornin'

[Verse 2: Krizz Kaliko & (Tech N9ne)]
Am I broke? No
Can I get the paper by the boatload?
Doing him a favor when I'm rockin' out later
Alligator on my shoes and boots
And new suit mean new recruits, ya dig?
('Cause you a pimp?) Well I think I is
I get drunk and I think I is
I like to drink my whiskey in a tall glass with a short straw
They pay me but they short ya'll (Okay)
I boat costa from Costa Rica
Better get the holes open, it's supposed to freak ya
They ain't 'sposed to see ya, they 'sposed to be ya
A chariot on my penis (Whatchu mean by that?)
Rojo, when I chose to be a, never lovin' no hoes, never goin' there
But I'ma shoto, can get everything, I rock a Manolo
But it's a no no, don't take that picture like a photo
(I see you bro)
Then get the pot and go Doe Doe quick
I get O's from the Pogo stick (They think they all so slick)
They call Rittz while we both go pimpin'
Our names on the oval blimpin'
And it's so simple, they bow to us both like temples
Our names are all in they dentals (All ya'll ballin' now, huh?)
But we don't pay no rent and all I know is I went

[Hook: Rittz]
I went from strugglin' every day to gettin' dough
People said I'd never make it, I should let it go
I was holdin' my convulsion knowin' I was next to blow
Everybody, every day, and we be fresh from head to toe
From mornin' to the nightfall
From the mornin' to the nightfall (aw, yeah)
Mornin' to the nightfall
I'm higher than a fly ball shinin' like a light bulb
From the mornin' to the nightfall

[Verse 3: Wrekonize]
See me workin', I've been waitin' on the high call
Been away from home for so Goddamn long but nobody ever tell me that my hyped called (that's poppin')
This is the path I've been bustin' my ass to keep on and get loose (word)
Waitin' for moments like this since way back when I was just a youth
Back then it was carnival, with a couple bars you could top it all
Spit shine on the track call me Armor All
And walk off with a life size Barbie doll, I'm like damn
My degree in high school came a couple clicks late
But I never took a break and I never changed pace
Lookin' back I never thought I would be livin' this great
(You mean you rich?) Well not exactly
I mean I'm in a band, I don't mean like Backstreet
I mean we juice it like a bunch a Russian athletes
All full of acne at a fuckin' track meet (Ha, I feel you)
You be thinkin' that I made it over night, you may wanna check in on the right call (Word)
None of it is oversight, if you don't believe me you just wait until the nightfall

[Hook: Rittz]
I went from strugglin' every day to gettin' dough
People said I'd never make it, I should let it go
I was holdin' my convulsion knowin' I was next to blow
Everybody, every day, and we be fresh from head to toe
From mornin' to the nightfall
From the mornin' to the nightfall (aw, yeah)
Mornin' to the nightfall
I'm higher than a fly ball shinin' like a light bulb
From the mornin' to the nightfall
