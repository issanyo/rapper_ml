[Verse 1]
We reppin' up Atlanta 770's the area code
A part of Georgia rarely exposed
Take a walk with me while I share with the globe
The darker side of the burbs
The drug supply is undeniable, lighters occurs
And now the time is fly
Yeah a lot business is hirering
Great place to raise kids, [?] just for retirement
When I look at where I live I see a different environment
Nobody's swinging fist, they pulling pistols and firing
Southern bitch who gets rated
When dad's have meth labs
Some pieces going out to task force they'll embed it
They be starving for action
Crash the party, you be starve for relaxin'
Somebody drunk outside a bar and blasting
On Jimmy Gordon they trapping
Laurence [?] just the same
They banging, watch your colors
They gon' ask you what you claim, fuck you name
Cause everybody say they from the A
Like they're ashamed to say Gwinnett
But this is where they come to stay now

[Chorus]
Come to my side
Homie it's time to let them know
GC in this bitch, we reppin' 770
Tell 'em (we’re from Gwinnett County)
(Watch out for Gwinnett County)
Come to my side bitch
It's time to let them know
GC in the house, we reppin' 770
Tell 'em (we’re from Gwinnett County)
(Watch out for Gwinnett County)

[Verse 2]
Use to rhyming to Ice
And I ain't talking 'bout diamonds and Jacob watches
Gratuated from YA, so we're blazing jelly
Crystal meth is in feed and they just favorite wave
That they can escape, hope it takes the greyness away
They can't blame it on age
I know some 40 year old's who snort up their nose
And can't afford they four year olds clothes
More imporant to hoes, be addicted to steal
Sippin' pregnant, wonder why they live infinite [?]
They better know your surroundings
I suggest it and recommend it
You might be living next to a registered sex offender
Teenager say 'fuck school' is boring and lame
And boys are joining they game, so they're doing the same
Living like they ain't got no one left
They know when someone dies in your apartment
Every time they change the name of the complex
From bar's to club's, sweat water's the satellite
We got the appetite for the cash and the faster life
G town!

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Ain't no [?] in my booze
A little burned up cross and [?]
From Laurence's little [?]
We profit and parked up a loot
And use a fellow who's runner
Like let the ancher shoot
The helicopters are follow them
Until they stop the pursuit
Don't get it wrong, Gwinnett ain't the hood
I really hate the way that it's judged
The radio never gave us the love, that we deserve
Now we the first creating the buzz
[?] ain't as safe as it was
We uncovered it and let 'em inside
Before me the only time you heard Gwinnett
Was on 11 and live, channel 2 with Monica [?]
You should take the [?] and precaution
No longer will the town persona be softened
Marijana's looking greener in a grinder, we cough it
We poppin' xanibars
A gram or shorts'll have you flying of the handle bars
A snort'll give you high
It's time you down in Georgia ridin' North on 85
Holler at your boy Rittz bitch

[Hook]
