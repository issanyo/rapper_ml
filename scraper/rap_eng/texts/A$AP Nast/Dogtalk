[Intro]
D33J on the beat and it bump

[Chorus]
Oh, Big Dog act like it
I ain't got no time for no bitch
Oh, Big Dog act like it
Hoe, pull up with the new one and I dip
Oh, Big Dog act like it
100 in the lane and I switch
Oh, Big Dog act like it
Hoe, I ain’t got no time for no bitch

[Verse 1]
A$AP GANG got your bitch turned on
Get big chills when I put my chains on
Yeah on, nasty too cold
Big tonka truck when i'm riding run them over
Cup running over
Copy that over
All these lanes we over
Know me I don't know ya
Ya nigga you old bruh
Your bitch coming over
I bet she give me head and let me fuck her on the sofa

[Chorus]
Oh, Big Dog act like it
I ain’t got no time for no bitch
Oh, Big Dog act like it
Hoe, pull up with the new one and I dip
Oh, Big Dog act like it
100 in the lane and I switch
Oh, Big Dog act like it
Hoe, I ain't got no time for no bitch

[Verse 2]
Na, na, no bitch, no bitch, no
Shorty on the ski lift, nose full of snow
Now we in the whip and I drift tokyo
In that all white fit, ya drip no yoke
I suppose this the life that I chose
No sleep, old jeep and new clothes
I remember ramen noodles, no heat the crib was cold
Now I'm gonna die rich, count the blueys till I'm old

[Chorus]
Oh, Big Dog act like it
I ain't got no time for no bitch
Oh, Big Dog act like it
Hoe, pull up with the new one and I dip
Oh, Big Dog act like it
100 in the lane and I switch
Oh, Big Dog act like it
Hoe, I ain't got no time for no bitch
