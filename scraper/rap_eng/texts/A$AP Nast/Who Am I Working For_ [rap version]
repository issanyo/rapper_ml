I gotta get another job now
Cuz I can't seem to make enough money
Damn, I've been working so hard now
But I still can't provide for my family

There is a knockin' at the door
Tax-man here, government want more
(Want more, government want more)
Who am I working for?

(And I wanna let go)
My strength is running out but I can't quit now
(Ooh-oh)
And I'm nearly going under... can't help but wonder
Who am I working for, who am I working for?
(Work, work)
Who am I working for, who am I working for?
(You better sing with me)

We can only go up from here, I believe
While you're at the bottom, I'mma be so high it's hard to see

I try to smile, but my troubles are so hard to forget
And I'm working like a dog just to get ahead
Wondering every single day, "Is it my turn yet?"
But somehow I can't get out of debt

There is the devil at the door
Tax-man here, government want more
(Lift me up, fuck being afraid)
Who am I working for?

(And I wanna let go)
My strength is running out but I can't quit now
(ooh-oh)
And I'm nearly going under -- can't help but wonder
Who am I working for, who am I working for?
(You better sing with me)

We can only go up from here, I believe
No one's more enslaved now than the ones who falsely feel they are free
