[Verse 1: A$AP Nast]
Here I go, hear me walk
Through the night, tip-toe
Here I go, got it
Run it, you got it
Big body, through the lanes
Swang my chain, watch me dance
On tha guap, I'm the man
Beat yo bitch, like Pootie Tang
She know how it go, she on go fo' sure
So we hit the crib, she take off her clothes
Give me top, in my Porsche
Turbulence, we taking off, hey
Takin' ova, you a lame
That's yo fault

I'm a boss, what's the cost?
Fuck the cost, buy it all
Buy the mall, buy em' all
See the RAF, throw it off
She can have my RAF, please don't touch my Comme
If you touch my Comme bullets to yo dome
