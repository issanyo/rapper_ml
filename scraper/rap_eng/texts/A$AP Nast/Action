[Verse 1: Joey Fatts]
Bitch I'm 'bout that action
I'm [?] going traffic
Tryna' case us, nigga slipping, we gon' let him have it
Glock clips long as intenines' if you want that static
In the whip, arm out the window, all my niggas blasting
Rockstar tatted
Cutthroat savage
Foreign coupe smashing
Bitch I'm 'bout that action

Her face up in the mattress
She throw it back, I slap it (Ay')
To the bros, I pass it (Ay')
Shawty' said she from Bay
Flew that bitch out to LA

Then a young nigga straight
Sticks like a drummer
Put that pump to your face
Like he asthmatic (Ay')
Boy don't come around the gang

[Verse 2: Joey Fatts]
Chop him to a fraction
If he think he active
Boy I'm really in these streets
You niggas on that that rap shit

Pull up, let you have it
Leave you where you standing
I'm in love with Dallas, but I got hoes in Houston
Slim waist, fat ass
On some fuck the crew shit
I'm in love with Dallas, but I'm in love with Houston
Southwest Alief Texas, Kream clicc the movement
And they 'bout that action
My niggas 'bout that action
You ain't want no action
Leave a nigga tragic
