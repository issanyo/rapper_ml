[Intro: Kevin Hart]
Me, by myself
One guy, one bullet
All day, every day
Wake up, go back to sleep, take a nap
You ever go night night, nigga!?
You about to go night night, nigga!
Everybody go night night, nigga!

[Hook: A$ton Matthews]
Then it's rock-a-bye baby
Rock-a-bye baby, rock-a-bye baby
Rock-a-bye baby
When the choppers knock, baby, then it's rock-a-bye baby
Rock-a-bye baby
Rock-a-bye baby, rock-a-bye baby
Rock-a-bye baby
When the choppers knock, baby, then it's rock-a-bye baby

[Verse 1: A$ton Matthews]
You never know names, my shooters got range
Get removed for the sane
When these new niggas hang, they new to the game
And the chopper leave brains
Who bringing the pain? Rang-a-tang on that ang
And it's gon' leave a stain
Hop out, do my thang, skrrt skrrt through the lanes
No face and no names
Give a fuck 'bout these lames, got ice in the cup
Got ice in the chain
Your bitch in the cut, dry sex in the cup, you want make it rush
Then bring it to us, you get in a jam, then you don't know us
We move on the hush, finessing, we juggin'
That shit that we clutchin', we'll need no discussion
It's nothin', my niggas know it's nothin'
Brick Mick Foley, flex Pac, arm, arm, leg, then headshots
Shorty, drop that acid, and show me what that neck 'bout
Neck service, that neck service, she'll bust it open if the check worth it
Money and the power, now these bitches tryna hang with me
Driver and a shooter, make a move, it ain't a thang to me
Hit a lick and then hit the road, catch five shots 'fore you hit the flo'
She hit the do' and hit the dome, that's a redbone under mistletoe

[Pre-Hook: A$ton Matthews]
My bitches, they foreign, you slippin', I'm scorin'
Two two-threes, I'm Jordan, you slippin', I'm scorin'
You slippin', I'm scorin', you slippin', I'm scorin'
You slippin', I'm scorin', I'm scorin'

[Hook: A$ton Matthews]
Then it's rock-a-bye baby
Rock-a-bye baby, rock-a-bye baby
Rock-a-bye baby
When the choppers knock, baby, then it's rock-a-bye baby
Rock-a-bye baby
Rock-a-bye baby, rock-a-bye baby
Rock-a-bye baby
When the choppers knock, baby, then it's rock-a-bye baby

[Verse 2: A$AP Ferg]
Rock-a-bye baby, bitch, you crazy
You think you killing me? I hit up your auntie and baby
Now ain't that your grandma Mercedes?
Cut that bitch and your grandpa, [?] Hades
Get her ass burned in the Benz
Window shield wipers with daises
Talk-and-never-do-the-shit nigga
Catch him messing with them hooligan niggas
A bunch of [?] demons off the wet
And the chiefer finna pull up, lookin' thru you with the blinker
Hit 'em with the lead like a number two pencil
Hungry while I wait, well then motherfuck this nigga
Catch a nigga dreaming while he drooling on the pillow
I pray to the Lord I could have a day, no sinnin'
Swear to God, stressed 'cause my head getting thinner
I wanna win, never motherfucking winter
Keep it in the jeans, pistol, need a zipper
Seeing life through the eyes of a killer
Catch him on the block like Thrilla in Manila
Make his ass shake like Ali and Frazier
Run up on his ass like a motherfucking pacer
Put him in a lake so I guess he a Laker, swim

[Pre-Hook: A$ton Matthews]
My bitches, they foreign, you slippin', I'm scorin'
Two two-threes, I'm Jordan, you slippin', I'm scorin'
You slippin', I'm scorin', you slippin', I'm scorin'
You slippin', I'm scorin', I'm scorin'

[Hook: A$ton Matthews]
Then it's rock-a-bye baby
Rock-a-bye baby, rock-a-bye baby
Rock-a-bye baby
When the choppers knock, baby, then it's rock-a-bye baby
Rock-a-bye baby
Rock-a-bye baby, rock-a-bye baby
Rock-a-bye baby
When the choppers knock, baby, then it's rock-a-bye baby

[Outro: A$AP Nast]
You ain't fucking with it, you feel me?
I want you to hurt niggas' feelings out here, bruh
Like seriously, my nigga
Like if you gon' move how a nigga move, man
You gotta be out here wilding out on these niggas, bruh
Don't fucking talking to niggas, don't sign no autographs
Don't talk to kids, slap babies
All this crazy shit, my nigga, you feel me?
That's the type of shit I'm on, bruh
We 'bout to take over the world, man, Out Here Boys, nigga
Yeah, you know what they call me, right?
