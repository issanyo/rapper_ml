[Intro: A$AP Bari]
Oh we finna fuck up a check today
Nigga, fuck that!
Oh we finna get paid today
I'm about my cash today (rrah!)
I'm 'bout my dough today, I'm 'bout my hoes today
Money on my mind every fucking day (Harlem)
Honeys on my mind every fucking day
Get that money young nigga!
Get that cash young nigga! Take that cash young nigga!
Flacko!

[Hook: A$AP Rocky]
I'ma ride, I'ma ride, I'ma ride, I'ma ride
I'ma ride, I'ma ride, I'ma ride
All that I wanted man, wanted some money man
Look at my wallet man, countin' up hunnids
Call me the money man, she do the money dance
I keep the money man, keep it one hunnid, yeah

[Verse 1: A$AP Rocky]
Cash rules everything around me, nigga ask about me
I swear my shooters be my juniors, call me Robert Downey
He held it down, he held his own, now holding down the county
It just so happen now, she wet and now I'm all outta Bounty
I'm the quicker picker-upper, still don't give no fucks bruh
Quick to pick her up, I be that pretty mothafucker
For fuckin' up my cash on Ubers, time to switch the truck up
Tip the driver, turn the Future up, fuck up some commas
Homicide, pussy good, eat it good, treat it good
Beat it good, peck a wood, wish you could
Love or ride, ride or die, ride it back forth, side to side
Make it shake, surfboard, make a nigga go dumb for it
I'ma ride, I'ma ride, love the bitch 'till I die
Genuine, Bonnie/Clyde,, we gon' die, homicide
Suicide, two of us, you and I, crucified
Truths and lies, you despise, I'm the best, you decide

[Hook: A$AP Rocky]
I'ma ride, I'ma ride, I'ma ride, I'ma ride
I'ma ride, I'ma ride, I'ma ride, I'ma ride
I'ma ride, choose a side, suicide
You and I, crucified
You despise
I'm the best, you decide

[Verse 2: A$AP Nast]
Pulled up on lil shawty, hello, howdy, Audi
I just hopped up out my Rover, shine my Rollie, uhh
I just hit my jeweler threw some diamonds on it
Told that hoe don't come I ain't got no times for phonies, uhh
I've been gettin' money, why you niggas fronting?
Uhh, Flacko told me "fuck 'em", I'm like "nah let's buck 'em"
I ain't got no time, these niggas want discussion
Told her drop that ass, I ain't tryna fuck you
Uhh, I just bought a stripper pole, I put it in my bedroom
Got your hoe plus several more sliding down the metal
666 off in your bitch, she call my dick the devil
She like "nasty baby demon", yeah that boy a rebel

[Hook: A$AP Rocky]
All that I wanted man, wanted some money man
Look at my wallet man, countin' the hunnids
Call me the money man, she do the money dance
I keep the money man, keep it one hunnid
Look at my product man, I'm made of money man
Check out my closet man, callin' it contraband
Fuck with the rubber bands, I count a hunnid bands
She see the money man, she do the money dance

[Outro: A$AP Rocky]
I'ma ride, I'ma ride, I'ma ride, I'ma ride
I'ma ride, I'ma ride, I'ma ride, I'ma ride
I'ma ride, choose a side, suicide
You and I, crucified
You despise
I'm the best, you decide
