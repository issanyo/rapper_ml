[Verse 1: A$AP Twelvyy]
I was born as a king, I'ma die as a lord
Know them niggas can't stand that
Man, I do this shit for Steve
I'ma prosper 'til I leave, I'll die to bring my man back
In a fresh pair of Air Max
Wilding on fear fact' with them dick eaters and them Benz at
I was overseas, brought a tan back
Shawty got a body, where her friends at?
And I'ma take care of that, she like what I like too
Only change your life for a night boo?
Then I'm on a flight to that Eiffel
Passport stamps, and some haiku
Super street fighter, call me Ryu
I know some niggas reppin' Piru
Sex, money, murder on the side too
Bickin' back boolin' through the drive thru
Party in the sixty, had to the slide through
This is what I ride to

[Hook: MD$]
Give up pressure, unattested
I just might testify against the love
If that's not right bitch I want more
Just live so fast, but we live long
Your girl know who you hid it from
My boy got free, so so so
Took one step back from this life I chose
Now it's time for money, drugs, and fine hoes
Money drugs and fine hoes
Money drugs and fine hoes
Money drugs and fine hoes

[Verse 2: A$AP Ant]
Hopped off the Chinese bus to Castle Hell
Shout out emails and my nigga bills
AK, broad day, get a nigga killed
Hitman selling contract, done deal
Got fans from the U.K. to Brazil
Your careers flipping, banana peel
Hungry niggas die like abortion pill
(God damn!)
(For real)

[Verse 3: A$AP Nast]
Not for nothing, I been hoping for a brighter day
Cuz ever since we lost a big homie I've been feeling like I'm 'bout to fade
Told my niggas keep it real
If you real on the real than you never change
I know we out here on the field and we feel how we felt but one day we can levitate
Smoking weed for the medication
Brain dead but he selling Valium
High enough we can celebrate
Got our wings, we can fly away
Like fuck a rolls, let's just cop a space ship
Get our ones up, let’s cut this cake
Like fuck ‘em all, went from broke to paid
Check the phone, you can see her name
Let's get it on cos we getting paid
We hater proof, that's just how we stay
Fuck around we just made a way
We some young niggas livin'

[Hook: MD$]
Give up pressure, unattested
I just might testify against the love
If that's not right bitch I want more
Just live so fast, but we live long
Your girl know who you hid it from
My boy got free, so so so
Took one step back from this life I chose
Now it's time for money, drugs, and fine hoes
Money drugs and fine hoes
Money drugs and fine hoes
Money drugs and fine hoes
