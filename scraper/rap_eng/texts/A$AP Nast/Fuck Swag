Uh, swag swag swag swag swag
Bitch, swag swag swag, uh

[Verse 1]
I been on a mission for a minute in my zone
Not concerned what all of these niggas actin like bitches throwin salt
So, fact is like to say he livin' he ain't livin' it at all
I throw money at these bitches in the minute that they call
Thats when i'll be up in they draws
Puttin' graffiti in the wall
Pussy poppin on that hand-stand, after that she hit the floor
Rackin them dollars, get that dough
Fuck you think im ballin' for?, grabbin' my jacket,robber mask(?)
I got shoe-strings touchin' the floor, middle finger to that low
Grippin' my pistol, standin tall
Get my point across with words, dont make that cannon get involved
Cause if that cannon get involved, I can guarantee you piece
Only a pillow and some sheets, cause you sleep
R.I.P, Rest in peace nigga
Fuck yo beef nigga, and we in these streets
Makin that dollar, rollin the weed
Windows down so bitches can see
You rollin along?, come fuck with some Gs
Roll with the best you ever seen
Never the less, you fuckin with me
Cause I can keep shit G bitch, uh
I be on some next level rebel shit
Fucked yo bitch, and her friend
They just wanna get in the mix
Not Scheming for Lunch thatâ€™s Lafayette
Get down the block from supreme n shit
Fightin these demons off, one of myself
Disguisin myself in these clothes, (?)
(?)
This is how we do it man, on the mothafuckin' east
