[Intro]
I get my breath together, drop that shit

[Verse 1: A$AP Nast]
From a crack hole down in hell's gates
To a new breathe of air and a brighter day
It some lighter way
I feel good enough to buy a bunch of real estate
Move my momma outta state
Why? Cause this the new power anthem
And nigga, we the new Black Panthers, bitch
Get your hands up, we in it for the ransom
Money, power, respect, blocks gave us the answer
New world order shit, always strive and prosper
I know God is watchin' over me
Wash away my sins now I'm in this bitch a longer stay
A$AP nigga, tell my cuzo that I'm on my way
In a hurry, fuck a hater, I just gotta tie my lace
Close my eyes, I'm outer-space
Huh, cause this the new power anthem
And nigga we the new Black Panthers
Bitch get your hands up
Yeah, they say lords never worry
Real lords never worry, real lords never worry, not
Kill y'all, never worry
Real lords never worry, hard on February, huh
Ugh, we the new Black Panthers, yeah
We the new Black Panthers, real lords never worry

[Verse 2: A$AP Twelvyy]
I bet the Lord never worried
Couple niggas buried
Man the good die young, gun shots and it's blurry
So I'm off in a hurry
I ain't forcin' no jerk to convince me
Trill shit, I'm tryna stay pig free
Got a budget for the lawyer, it's my freedom on the corner
It ain't worth it, making history is more important
My thoughts is soarin', smokin' power
Mighty Morphin' tripped the vegee in the mornin'
Gettin' jiggy with a foreign
Look I just finished tourin', world wide residential
All started with a pencil, now my suites presidential
Layed up with a bad bitch that never had shit
All these bags and gold, she think I'm mad rich
Now I'm average, simple and I'm humble
Bring your cameras to the hood, takin' pictures of the jungle
Man it's all thugs out here, all Bloods out here
You with a real rice so it's all love out here

[Verse 3: A$AP Rocky]
I wrote this shit in business class, gave me jet lag
This for years of oppressions and the set backs
This for chinks, niggas, jews, and the wetbacks
Crackers, towel heads, and I can't forget the last, fags
This is Huey Newton with the Uzi shootin'
The trill Martin Luther finna spark the Ruger
Malcolm X's Muslim army marchin' to ya
Flacko bring the chopper to ya, preacher screamin' hallelujah
Dear Mr. President, I'm the shit
No hope for the kids
Young Blood was a thug, caught slugs from a Crip
My Father, God Father, our Father
Glocks in the air, Hiiipower
This is Kendrick off to visit Jimi's watchtower
A long it, seems like Martin dreamin' for the longest
Niggas I do songs with is the same that I put on with
Stupid with my flow because biters, they be on it
It's safe to say you stole it nigga ever since I loaned it
Cause I only let you hold it, now you frontin' like you own it
I know it (Shorty's gonna be a thug)
Said he's gonna be (A GNT saw the blood)
I'm a young lord, that's the bottom line
Gold grills, black nails, little niggas out of line, huh?
