[News Reporter]:
And here at the scene our cameras clearly show the extent of destruction. Indicating it was truly a miracle that no lives were lost. Although a small number of people were injured. And as unthinkable as it is to believe. All the eye witnesses name the same culprit

[Bumpy Knuckles]:
Y'all know the name
Haha. It's Bumps

Turn up the music it's Bump back in the booth
Let you punk motherfuckers that claim clappin' the roof
Make you certified hardcore
I slap ghostwriters and niggas they writin' for
What you bitin' for?
I Van Gogh the art of war and stomp like a dinosaur
Doin' damage I'm a connoisseur
A bit strange the pitch range is bitch range
These new niggas will suck dick to get change
It's bigger than words, it's deeper than verses
(Y'all know)
I wake up with beef, you sleepin' in hearses
(No talk)
Predictable flows, your words are the safest
(Let's keep it real)
You fuckin' with Bump, I feel like a rapist
(Let's rock out)
You know Bumpy Knuckles name equal knuckle game
With a .45 caliber that buckle frames
In the bullpen warming up the mount
Three and two is the count and I'm bringin' in the fire arm
These bitch niggas at bat ain't spittin' rap
They just hoggin' up airtime tryin' to get their liar on
Got five nines like Royce
For each day of the week cause weekends I rest my voice
I'm doin' damage
