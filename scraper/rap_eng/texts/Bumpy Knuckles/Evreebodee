[Intro]
Ha
Yeah
Ha, ha ha ha
Let's ride, ha

[Verse 1]
Everybody want to be sexy
Everybody want to be rich
Everybody want to be gangster
But deep down you're really a bitch (word up)
Everybody want to be kingpin
Sit down and watch a real kingpin
Hip-hop bars that sit behind the beat
While yall wack niggas can't even find the beat
Ha, Premo did it
Pass it to Bump so he can fuck with it (word up, ha)
I keep a hammer on me still like I'm John Henry
I don't want to meet your friends 'cause I'm non-friendly
Huh, And bitches love my attitude
I show long black gratitude (word)
I keep a fat knot of hundreds tucked in my boot
And I will slap jacking niggas tryna take my loot
OG's know me (word up), on stage
Rocking with Premier, that's what people wanna see
So that's what people gonna see

[Bridge w/ Scratches by DJ Premier]
"To the beat yall!" (And to be beat yall, C'mon)

[Verse 2]
Everybody want to be angry (Why you mad?)
Where was yall when Bumpy was angry? (the shutdown)
Everybody want to be a DJ
Lot of yall suck at being DJ's (Word)
Everybody want to be rappers
Bars be corny as shit
A lot of yall sideline clappers
Know you're being phony as shit
My voice so nice over Premo style
Pimp shit through kick and snares
Bumpy 'bout to get another run in the rap game like
Me and D.M.C. done paired
I still like ripping mics, 'cause that's what MC's do
Preem on the 1 and 2, I'm one of few
That can stand before boom bap greatness
And body shit like I do, true

[Outro w/ Scratches by DJ Premier]
"Everybody"
(Yeah
Everybody, everybody, everybody
Yeah
Everybody, everybody)
