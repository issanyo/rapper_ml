[Intro - Akrobatik]

[Verse 1 - Akrobatik]
Bumpy Knucks, Big Ak, yeah we doin it big, pack
The spots, make it hot and never be where the pigs at (uh)
I miss that money, when I don't make it
So if your nose is all up in my biz, I gotta break it (no doubt)
I don't burn bridges and such
But if you fuckin with my business, you gettin fucked up
Broke legs, hurt feelings and dreams deferred
All I gotta do is give my team the word (yeah)
Then the vision of your scheme is blurred (blurred)
Courtesy of the illest cats that you ever seen or heard (what up!)
The third rock away from the sun is now mine (mine)
So to anybody fuckin with me or my shine (yeah!)

[Verse 2 - Bumpy Knuckles]
Yo, it's the dopest MC, with the O.G. flow
That real nigga shit, I spit, will drop you yo
Don't act like Ak won't come back with Bumpy, to clap
That's how I rock for my comrades, black ,
In a hoodie, all black, carhartt, forty belows
And it ain't no talkin, just two 40's that blow (BLAOW!)
"How You Like Me Now" like Moe Dee
If niggas murder you, I'm the Co-D (what?)
Since I was a roadie, I was studyin oldies and O.G.'s
Ask any gangsta, they know me (that's what he do, my nigga)
See if we can't build, then you will be destroyed
Startin them bullshit beefs, you should avoid
If I get annoyed
You'll make the Amber Alert like a missing little boy (whoa!)
