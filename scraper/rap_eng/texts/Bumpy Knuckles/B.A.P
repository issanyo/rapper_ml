(When the streets are full of smoke and the sound of roaring guns, they'll say to you: do you think we were really brave or just lacking in imagination? Well, they've been warned that the testing days are ahead. Of the past months, we may well say: we've live a life, and not an apology
And of the future, I think most of them would say: we shall live hard, but we shall live)

Headqcourterz rest in peace

(How this nigga stay so hot?!)

[Hook]
How come so many people wanna hear me and the Priem
Cause that’s that boom-bap killer supreme
Niggers get scared And they run to Priem
Can you please ask Bumpy to release the team

Goon in the booth now you're all quiet
Cause you know you in the room with the truth
I don’t give a fuck about your gun I got one son
The difference is I pop like gum
You run like Rev
No diss just real metaphorically sick with my shit
Because I put time into the rhyme style quality moments
In the booth, I write down truth and spit it
Salute my nigga Gifted Unlimited Rhymes
But really was a comrade who spazzed sometimes
Back stage antics on stage plant it
Pretty girl right in the front you bagged it
Waiting for signature Primo scratch
Big Shug and Bumpy Knuckles got your back
Brim low with the frames on like prescription
Friendschip versus biaa... To write description
I could never figure what the distance was about
But I did see the infiltration playing out
See, some sick nigga see weakness
Fertilize it and tweak it
With the hate
And motherfuckers stay clean away from me
Cause he knows I'd a leaked him, like a lake
And when he did see me he didn't look in my eyes
Cause he know how to peep him
Cause he fake

[Hook]
I think hip hop thinks I fell off
I hope you don't think I fell of
You buggin', you buggin'
I'm still gangsta

[Hook]

Cowards got real niggers playing themselve
Begging for a dollar when they really could take it
You catch me fucking around one of these niggers
It would be in his house with his momma butt naked
Get get getting my fuck on
Two 'o' clock in the morning
She notice the truck gone
The love song is 'If You Think You Are Lonely Now'
Playing in the background
You still horny and I am back now
Real gangsta shit this ain’t plastic spit
Pass the blit we way past the spit
And I am committed to hip hop
That’s my bitch Priem and Bumpy knuckles we make that shit
Boom bip, boom bap
Right in your face
And make a motherfucker styleswitch right in your face
I'll punch you right in your face

[Hook]

How these rap niggers get legendary status
And they really ain't legendary niggers
They never rap real shit
And when they walk real shit
They gots to call real niggers
You don’t ever wanna get so comfortable
You feel you can test my gully
I shoot a hole in your skully
Soak you in so many left-right blows
It's like you in a knuckle shower
You won’t like those
I got a big butt bitch with real nice toes
That will put the snub nose on tip of your nose
And my back bitch strike a pose
She gon' shoot holes
In your mother fucking clothes

[Hook]
