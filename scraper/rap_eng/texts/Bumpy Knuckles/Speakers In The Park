[Verse 1]
Speakers in the park project beats
Under Speakers in the park
Emcee skills is a must
Old-school niggas don't fuss
We got way too many rhymes to bust, trust
Remember "Yes yes y'all" and "Don't stop the body rock"?
I was a part of that
Cause shots that I popped made they body rock
Body drop
Records, like boxes are way too heavy
It's Freddie Foxxx, off the top
Lyrically balanced
Everything I rhyme about ain't all about violence
Even if I put violence in it
It's only for a minute
Twenty four hundred a minute
Is that collaboration limit for you gimmicks
You niggas rhyming for a ham sandwich
The middle of a man sandwich -- pause

Step up your flow game
Some you niggas sound so lame
Still acting like no-names
No gain, no game
No pain, no bitching
No lying, no crying
No shitting on the tour bus
Guns loaded that will bust
If anybody disrespect us
We trust that the real niggas will respect it
Cause all the real niggas stay connected
Y'all on that Internet shit talking beef shit
I'm on some bust you in your head on the motherfucking street shit
Leak your Yankee fitted
And the streets gon' thank me with it
Fuck your ideologies
I'd rather hear the hood stories of Prodigy over Primo
That speaks to all the cats that we know
Salute Andre 3000 and Cee-Lo
Who invented that steelo?
It's just an argument amongst me and my niggas
Cause everybody gotta start somewhere
You probably saying, what the fuck do you care?
Cause y'all niggas up north can't get your records off
And, I agree with that
Cause y'all Dirty South cats got copycats who started rap
Now that's powerful and pitiful
That a legend can't remain spittable
Niggas is classic, literal
I'mma keep rocking to this beat cause it's so dope
Baldhead Isaac, lyrically I'm sick
My rhymes put cats under pressure
Cause I weave my words through they songs like a sweater
They start sweating, become sweat-ers
Watching how I spit every letter
Words which I spit better
Vocabulary, you spit hard but you scary
That scares me
Or better yet, concerns me
That's why I keep them hammers on my hip
The same ones that burn me
Twin Glizzle
Front and I show you they still work, for shizzle
Can Bump Knucks say, "For shizzle"?
Well, I respect E-40 and Snoop D-O-double gizzle
And before the game fizzle
I gotta give props to certain niggas
I respect they grizzle
I'm not dissing -- never no disrespect ever
Bumpy Knuckles raising niggas up like a lever
Elevator, cause I like to elevate you
I never hate you
Y'all niggas made the game more relevant
While I remain the elephant
Stomping out snakes and fakes
