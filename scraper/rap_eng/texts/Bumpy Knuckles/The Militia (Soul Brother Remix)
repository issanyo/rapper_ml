"A special guest"
"It's The Militia, The Militia"
This is a conquest, so I suggest you take a rest
Or keep a breath, but definitely keep a vest on that chest
Rhymes I'm packin', just like a thug at a car jackin'
Shoot off your hat when I start cappin', this is no actin'
G A N G, S T A double R
And you don't want no trouble up in here, baby pa
From the late night drama, of the New York streets
To the hoods of LA, real niggas likin' Primo's beats
Put suckers on glass, send 'em, back to class
And kick hot shit, so we can stack the Johnny Cash
I brought the God, Rakim, lyrically gunning you wanna dash?
I got Dub C, from South C, what you doubt me?
Travellin' through war zones with my infrared microphone
In the year One Mill, destroying, enemies' chromozones
Words burn through flesh, leavin' nothing but skeletal
You best pay respect to the legends, boy I'm tellin' you, Militia
The illest, realest, representin'
Bringin' the ruckus, let it be known
The illest, realest, word up
It's The Militia, The Militia
The illest, realest, representin'
Bringin' the ruckus, let it be known
The illest, realest, word up
It's The Militia, Militia
Makin' a move, makin' a move, who's that nigga that's makin' a move?
It's the Shadiest rhymin' back, actin' a motherfucking fool
Four, four packers, my jackets? Hittin' the tag? Saggin', baggin'
Foot on my rag, mess up a bag, leavin' my enemies in bodybags
You niggas was crackin', what y'all thought it wasn't gon' happen?
Dub C and my East Coast sisters gettin' together rappin'
Gun clappin', chump smackin', kiss the ring of your highness
Look while I'm in New York City
Walkin' with two of the Brooklyn's finest
My two affiliates from the East we all bang
But if y'all don't mind, this is still Westside Connec' gang
Dress code the same, just new pieces on my neck
East Coast brownies, house shoes, and hair nets
Y'all can't see this, so peep the sister G is pushin' a Six
As I freak this, caviar Gang Starr Militia remix
It's Dub C the jankiest loc', I'm runnin' this here
With the Guru and New York's hardest, DJ Premier, Militia
The illest, realest, representin'
Bringin' the ruckus, let it be known
The illest, realest, word up
It's The Militia
The illest, realest, representin'
Bringin' the ruckus, let it be known
The illest, realest, word up
It's The Militia
Yo, it's The Master, mister, Musical Massacre
Passion for disaster, paragraph ambassador
R get the red carpet, just call me on
Corner the market like the mic's last name was Corleone
The facade killer, come through your city like Godzilla
Think of the sickest thing you ever seen, Ra's iller
My vision's are vicious, suspect suspicious
Plans is ambitious, my motive's malicious
No interferin', if you ain't down, you got to swearin'
These cats they ain't carin', habitat awarin'
Crack appearin', from out the track that I'm hearin'
It's either that or I'm going back to racketeering
Yo, you should see me, I got a crew like Mussolini
But Kool as Moe Dee, my flow be, smooth and easy
Pretenders every sentence to wilers, you get the picture?
Rakim is, the minist', with malice, Militia
Gang Starr, The R, Dub C, baby pa
Straight up, check it out
