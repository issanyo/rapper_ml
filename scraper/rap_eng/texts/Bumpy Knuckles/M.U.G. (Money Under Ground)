[Verse 1]
[O.C.]
Penicillin on wax, the cure for rap
Crooklyn Dodger number two back on the map
Perhaps you thought I was gone, well, surprise, nigga
Not physically, but I'm a massive figure
Al Pacino status, the baddest, exotic
Repetition like a automatic, can't stop it
High potent, poke Satan like coke snortin'
When I was a fetus, moms thought about abortin'
Important, am I? Gotta ask myself
But then I think twice like a Gemini
Authentic, percentage
Calculating my mind state equals infinite
Bizarre, pa, ain't it? Flow lethal like Draino
Lava, from a volcano
Scorchin', torchin' the microphone, I lost it
Poppin' shit, who got my back?
Freddie Foxxx with the twin millies
Burn a temperillo
Ayo Foxxx, fuck these niggas
Slice 'em up like an ox, pop

[Freddie Foxxx]
Yeah
Ok, it's time to bring these rap cats from Fantasy Isle
I bring it to these fake niggas with a Tec and a smile
You know my stid-dyle, America's most feared entertainer
Yeah, from New York to Cali, I'm called an acid rainer
While you frontin' like you ballin', son I stays in the mix
Same bullets in your burner since '76
Act like you can't tell, shit be live as hell
Bustin' so many shots
When my shells hit the ground it sound like "Rock the Bells"
Call me Bumpy Knuckles 'cause my hands be swell
From knockin' niggas out from the lies they tell
Oh well, I bet you feel me all up in your chest
I make the softest nigga catch a body, blame it on stress
And if he snitch, I bail him out and murder his bitch
And then sedate him with my four pound clap
Shit's only rap
But I'm livin' like that
So when while niggas be talkin' like dogs, and walkin like cats
Niggas mouths is gettin' way too fat
But O.C. & big Fid-Oxxx, we 'bout to bring it back

"Let's go back"
"I'm tellin' it just like that"

[Chorus: O.C. & Freddie Foxxx]
We be money under ground but you can't get none
'Cause if you step into my round, you be one dead son
We get love where niggas be scared to come
And we got a whole lot to give, but you don't want none

[Verse 2: O.C. + Freddie Foxxx + (both)]
Yeah, any nigga play high post, I'm rollin' over
O.C. weigh tons like a fuckin Range Rover
Tellin' niggas to they face that the facade is over
Now it's time for this real nigga shit, can you feel this?
No question, we manifestin', what we feel
Bust up in your session, smack niggas up like adolescents
Like at D&D, I can't see a gang or no motherfuckin' body seein' me
That's just pure fantasy
True indeed, son, we ain't the ones
While niggas goin out like that, we bring it on like Scarface
That's means murder case, I bring highs to any base
Disrespect the closed session and your ass gets laced
(So all of these beats and these rhymes attached)
Mean that real niggas on the mic, bringin' it back
It's mad potent, like good crack, it's type addictive
All up in ya mind, you don't wan't hard times

[Chorus: O.C. & Freddie Foxxx]
We be money under ground but you can't get none
'Cause if you step into my round, you'll be one dead son
We get love where niggas be scared to come
And we got a whole lot to give, but you don't want none

What?
