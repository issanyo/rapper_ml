[Intro]
To the beat, y'all
Salute to hip-hop all the time
The greatness
Yo

[Verse]
This is Premo to the next level
And I'm smiling at you hating ass niggas, rebels
I bring bass to your treble, trouble, devil
Four fifth to you lung, now take off the bezel
I'm the prodigal article in the rap article [?]
I go hard at you, getting in the way, I make it hard to do
I watched a lot of rappers in the last 12 years lose faith
'Cause sun don't shine in their states
It's a continuous grind with the culture in mind
Stop talking like bitches, and shut up and rhyme
Salute to DJ's that really do it
New rhymes with an old style attached to it
It's time to make that move Shalamar, Howard Hewett
Can't forget the old style, duke, I used to do it, fluent
To say you started it is wack shit, the flow is classic
You'd know it if you was digging through them discount baskets
Jewelry is just a dressing
I'll strip you down to raw skills, purify the lesson
A lot of niggas think that 'cause they rhyme on Premo, that can validate your skill
Yeah, but we know that is not the real scenario
Like Milo, Danko, and Brown on stage without Busta
That's not the real scenario
Real niggas listen, I'm noticing that hip-hop is splitting
Into branches like trees do
Saying you're the next one and you gon' save the game
Well please do, we need you
DJ's are selling out faster than cheap cars
MC's are selling their best bars for cheap cars
Ain't nobody paying, and ain't no weight to nothing these corny niggas are saying
What game are you playing?
When niggas used to say "yo, you heard what he said?"
But now they say "yo, I heard that, the lyrics is dead
Where's the next one, and try not to be versey
Can you start it off with controversy? Put a hook on it"
360 and you're rocking for that label paper
Now your money's gone and you can't eat 'cause the crooks own it
