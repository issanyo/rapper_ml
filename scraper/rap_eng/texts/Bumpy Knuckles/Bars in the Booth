[Intro]
To the beat, and you don't stop
Bump Knucks, and you don't stop
Freddie Foxxx, and you don't stop

[Verse]
That cocky nigga got the mic back, word is on the streets that
He ain't tryna hear that, so y'all niggas peep that
Fuck you and your whole team, I was taught shoot or kill
Hammer in the stash spot, '85 Coupe de Ville
Beefing with the white cat, show up in the G suit
[?], some British and a Lee suit
Spit the hottest pea soup, ya niggas should regroup
This joint got a blast that will turn you into tree roots
Ya niggas is grapefruits, I should call you ate food
Served to the rapper that makes niggas pay dues
Way before the gay rules, I was down with BDP
Bangers do pop when you fuck with a real MC
Bumpy got an appetite, niggas hate to see me eat
Here's another style to bite for niggas tryna to keep it street
Cold beef with you nigga, that's why I'm bringing heat
Hot like a stage light, brighten up your grave site
I'm a problem in the night time, straight through the daylight
Your block is like a campsite, we gon' put that time in
Nigga, there's a problem in the hood when I'm grinding
Grinding with the rhyming, Hotter than the sheep skin on June 10th
When the sun is up beaming new strength
Shotty in the full length, that's why you see the goon limp
With a way better plan than yours, I'm like the new Sprint
Yeah I'm like a nuisance for new dollars, new cents
Act like I'm out of my mind but I got good sense
You nicer than Bumpy Knuckles is pretense
Nigga, spot screwing your face, you're only decent
Ice grill in the mic and when it feed back
You duck, movie over action cut
You niggas don't sound confident but constipated
My mic and the bars related
I came in this game with the mindset to win
No matter who doubt me, I got to get it in
Deal makers, deal breakers, all you cats are million-dollar fakers
When it come to spitting lakes, I'm the Lakers
Get rich being a giver, exposed all the takers
Walk like a don, God like Adonis
Violate me and you die, I promise, all rhymes honest
People pray for me to lose, I feel like Floyd Mayweather
Counting 20 million on the cruise
With my name on the boat, Ciroc and pink lemonade moisten up the throat
Bad bitches while I float, Trump calls me the Goat
Trained in the art of connecting star makers
Flame is the light, I'm reflecting what I'm made of
War with the demons on my way up
Fuck all this talking nigga, pay up or lay up

[Outro]
Yeah, Bump Knucks
Preem, bars in the booth, knock out your tooth
Truth
Bitch nigga
Run it
