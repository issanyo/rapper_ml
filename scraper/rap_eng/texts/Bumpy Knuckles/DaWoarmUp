Turn up the rebel just another level, reason why
I was just a boy reading Die Nigga Die!
I noticed that the ways and ethics of the slavecatch
In today's blacks -- how the fuck can I say that?
Cause way back, niggas signed niggas and jerked them
Then they sign you and jerk you
You happy with a chain, you jerk you
Promote you, they eat, and that hurts too

Raw with the flows like raw through the nose
From raw through the nose, rawest rapper niggas know
Gorging off shows, George Forman-type flows
Grilling y'all niggas, I feel like killing y'all niggas
Because the hate is unbearable
Flows sound terrible, you no way comparable
Rhyme styles are wearable, but not like clothes
Like tires, I'm still fire
Frame sliders, name riders, motorcycles and shit
So loud that your ears can't handle the shit
