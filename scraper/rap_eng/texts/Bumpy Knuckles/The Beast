[Verse 1: The Audible Doctor]

The beast on beats slanging this heat, with street slang and it's deep
Retreat playing ain't me, it's peace or hanging them see
Deceased dangling from trying to tangle with me
Angling for change for chains, Django in this bitch I'm free
You don't want mine
Record into the boards and leave them more shook than an epileptic upon a fault line
I cause rhymes to enter your mental cavity
Rattling your brain if you feeling insane enough to battle me what
Another casualty is nothing leave them slain
I came to dead everything and leave them suffering in shame
For even bluffing that the name Audible's nothing to the game
Caught a few fronting leave them laying for cutting out of their lane
Fuck the fame of this, I been recording since before you were nameless
Got the nerve to kick the console to watch the game shift
The aim's sick something we don't play with
Audible and Bumpy the beast bumping through tape decks what

[Hook: The Audible Doctor]

The beast back in this bitch
So ease back 'fore it kicks
With these tracks you get hit
To teach rap to the kids
The beast back in this bitch
So ease back 'fore it kicks
Uh, the beast back yeah
The beast back in this bitch what (x2)

[Verse 2: Bumpy Knuckles]

Yo
Nine's are ringing like little vocal singers
These bitch ass rappers they get the middle finger (fuck you)
Legendary footsteps on a live stage
Bump in this motherfucker lock off of my cage
My age my rage set strikes against me
Fuck you your opinion made me independent
Better be careful what you say, cuz you might offend me
Knowing the next show you do, I'll be there to end it
Knuck Audible recordable over boom bap on a boombox that's portable
25 nickle plated in the front pocket
Hoping my day goes well so I don't have to pop it
Lot of tough guy housewives, this game's been downsized, on downtime
The 45 in the brown bag, don't sound bad, to my comrades
Word

[Hook: The Audible Doctor]

The beast back in this bitch
So ease back 'fore it kicks
With these tracks you get hit
To teach rap to the kids
The beast back in this bitch
So ease back 'fore it kicks
Uh, the beast back yeah
The beast back in this bitch what (x2)

[Verse 3: The Audible Doctor]

The knock designed to make them nauseous
They all fraudulent make pawns of men
And dispense them to penetrate your fortress
Be cautious I'm not the one to war with
He swore with is hand on the bible
That all his rivals will be tortured
Of course it's just a matter of proper offense
In all tense the past, present and what you wanted
A future but it's looking sorta like you can't afford it
Which is funny with all that money you claiming who would have thought it
I'm off it these tracks be like a mosh pit
You feel the angst of the youth rebelling I'm banging the truth of course it's
The monster breathing flame and aiming to torch this
Maiming your baby momma making sure she can't support ya
Used to be you could snort it, now you being aborted
That fetus flow, people know, you wasn't born for this
The warriors of boom bap who rap just glorious
Notorious for these tracks we laugh victorious
What
