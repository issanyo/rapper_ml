[Hook: King Myers]
Tell 'em relax
I came to bring the pain, at the end of the day, ain't nothin' pullin' me back
And I ain't here to play, cause I'm here to stay
So you can tell 'em relax, relax, relax, rela-axxx
Tell 'em relax, relax, relax, rela-axxx
Tell 'em relax

[Verse 1: King Myers]
Matta fact I tell 'em fall back, cause they don't really want no problems
I'm tryna get paid, a lot of numbers with commas
I know a couple people that'll wrinkle ya collar
If you ever in ya life step to me with drama
So don't bother the King n*gga
Cause I been tryna get rich since I was 3 n*gga
Now I'm a grown kid and I mess with 3 women
If she willin', I'll take her to the crib and show her how a King get it
I'm a monster, I live life on the side
Give me some dough and some cheese, now that's 8 pies
No I don't bake pies, I just make pies
These other cats just died, now they got 8 lives
Yeah I be movin' fast, I don't brag
And you could catch me with a Queen, but I don't drag
They on my backside so I'm flashy with it
Boy I'm nasty, something like Magic with it (ha-ha)

[Hook: King Myers]
Tell 'em relax
I came to bring the pain, at the end of the day, ain't nothin' pullin' me back
And I ain't here to play, cause I'm here to stay
So you can tell 'em relax, relax, relax, rela-axxx
Tell 'em relax, relax, relax, rela-axxx
Tell 'em relax

[Verse 2: Freddie Foxxx/Bumpy Knuckles]
Sit back and relax while I bench press this track
And rep it like Barzenegger
I show up at shows with cars of n*ggas who protect my life
Like I'm MC Hard to Get At
And they earn that, microphone bless and return that, it's real talk
Every I go, always rep New York
And body every time
Tell 'em when they speak of Uncle Bump, that n*gga Foxxx body every rhyme
Underground legend in Hip-Hop, and I ain't trippin'
Four five on the OG, and I ain't slippin'
Clown n*ggas get a front row seat to see the master
School these n*ggas, at the mic rippin'
Not too many rhymes spit sicker than mines
And I know more n*ggas so you easy to find
I certify King Myers yeah it's really his time
Ha-ha, and let it breathe right here, c'mon!

[Hook: King Myers]
Tell 'em relax
I came to bring the pain, at the end of the day, ain't nothin' pullin' me back
And I ain't here to play, cause I'm here to stay
So you can tell 'em relax, relax, relax, rela-axxx
Tell 'em relax, relax, relax, rela-axxx
Tell 'em relax
