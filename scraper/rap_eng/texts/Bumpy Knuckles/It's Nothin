[Intro:]
I am the realest rapper
Not gonna lie, I am by far the realest rapper
I really did it
If you go to my roots, I really did it
Not showing them a jump off
Like i really did
When Chris Lighty signed me
I had benzes and Bmws and trucks and er'thing

[Verse 1:]
I body this beat I'm a track Killer
You gon have to sue me, Mack Miller
Ever since 16 I'm a crack dealer
Spit 16, straight crack ask Mack Miller
Ask Bumpy if i knuckle up
Lil' haze, Lil' Dro, Double ducks
Ray allen couldn't shoot a nigga
Bitch accept the ball like a tutor giver
She got my kids in her mouth, she a baby sitter
Make a hit then I'm out [then I'm out]
My nigga locked up, bail him out
Nigga stop asking bout flow Joe
New whip, New chain, same logo
Turn a deuce-deuce to a 44
Itâ€™s a no-go if it ain't rose gold
In the rose gold spark outs SoHo
I got crack for sale
Niggas wanna crack me down
They smile in my face but those niggas really wanna see crack in jail
I got crack [crack x2]

[Talking]
Listen I know you coming back to the game
Absolutely
And I know you coming like for real ???
Absolutely, We got some, we got some joints
A lot of joints done already
Joints with Fat Joe ??? We working... We working with a lot of big names

[Verse 2:]
Now niggas, Talk about me but please don't touch
Cuz I ain't got no safety homie, I might bust
And when I bust my hot rocks gon hit you
And if they miss you, then my dawgs will sic you
And we ain't had no shots so we got rabies
And if you put up your dukes you'll be pushing up daisies
I'm lazy from all that piff that I blow
And I get it for cheap from this bitch that I know
On the east side, I get on top then she rides
When I bus' off I dust off and be slide
Gotta go, I'll be back yo
I meet the bitches and exing them out like tic-tac-toe
Get that that dough, is what I live by
And I'mma get that dough until I desire

[Talking]
Yo freddie foxxx, what's good my genes
It's always been the guest MCs that body everybody's records
Cuz i've been underground doing this like that for a while

[Outro:]
Wappy knuckle spirituals
Bitch [??]
So I an even deeper brotherly bond
What level he murderous flow
Probably party and hoes
Double he's as he goes
[?]
My killers in the 4 5 roll through and make the vibe airy
The whole outside line leery
Cuz the bump is here
It's bout to be some funk in here
Real niggas in the room
Lule 1 no search, two guns
Two shooters on the wings
The last thing you wanna do around me
Is brag about selling em' things
Tempting, raw from the underground pipeline
