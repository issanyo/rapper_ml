[Intro: Bumpy Knuckles]
Ah, ya niggas love Bumpy Knuckles on this Premo shit
Word up
Kolexxxion
This a banger
This is big
This hip-hop has got to be
This
We got to play this shit right here in a big stadium
This is stadium music right here
Hip-hop, let's take it back to the stadium
Salute to hip-hop
Everybody in hip-hop, throw your hands up right now
We're going to get this motherfucking popping
Bumpy Knuckles
Let's go

[Verse 1: Bumpy Knuckles]
I call this the stadium shaker
Right hand coming from the ear, CRACK!, cranium breaker
I don't give a fuck about the story that make ya
I'll pop you and be out before the Lord can take ya
In the game, I'm an OG, nigga face it
When I'm in the room, y'all faces get basic
Niggas tone their mask, see the nigga Bumpy Knuckles?
He gon' stay with two blickies, right through the 60s
Hard stance, tighten hands
Bumpy throwing knuckles with lightning hands
These beats bang hard like pots and pans
On Premo, you get Freddie Foxxx enhanced
C'mon

[Hook 1: Flava Flav (Bumpy Knuckles)]
Yeah boy, this shit is hot (shake the room)
Hip-hop is terrorizing the spot (shake the room)
New York City block on the rock (shake the room)
We got a club banger, get off your jock

[Verse 2: Bumpy Knuckles]
When a DJ want to show you he nice, he spin wax
When rhyming is a part of your life, you spit facts
When MCs step on stage with a nigga who don't give a fuck who you know
They fall back
You're talking to a bonafide pimp with the 45 on him type limp
I dare you to say something
Standing on the side of the stage, couple of goons, mic check
Premier, play something
You ain't a big enough for me to get a rep on like 25 pounds
I put it down, hit the bench
Three hundred on the rack, two deep breaths
And I throw that shit back like a shot of yak
Word up

[Hook 2: Flava Flav (Bumpy Knuckles)]
Come on yo, let's go (shake the room)
We get it in baby, yo (shake the room)
Freddie Foxxx on the motherfucking floor (shake the room)
What the fuck do you motherfuckers know

[Verse 3: Bumpy Knuckles]
When MCs fall off, the pain is felt
From the bottom of the deck, the game is dealt
These punk ass niggas with their blowjob deals
I miss Guru, fuck how Solar feels
I step to you, show you how the crowbar feels
Put knots to you, speed like over this hot shit
You always want it to be like
Boy, here's the green light, c'mon
Hands in the air, I'm the king of this here
Even though it ain't fair, there will never be an heir
Hands in the air, ladies titties out
Now we're stomping your city out
Come on, shake

[Flava Flav (Bumpy Knuckles)]
This shit is straight up crack (shake the room)
A world premiere break your back (harder)
We got a club banger homie, word up (shake the room)
Got something to say, shut the fuck up (C'mon)

[Verse 4: Bumpy Knuckles]
Bumpy on the block, I got a banger from Perm
Boom bap, underground, when will you learn?
Bumpy Knuckles, Premo, we making moves
Kolexxxion, bangers, shaking rooms, c'mon
Shake

[Flava Flav (Bumpy Knuckles)]
Yeah boy, this shit is hot (shake the room)
Hip-hop is terrorizing the spot (yeah)
New York City block on the rock (shake the room)
We got a club banger, get off your jock

[Verse 5: Bumpy Knuckles]
The boom, hip-hop spitfire goon
And I was better than I was yesterday afternoon
A lot of y'all niggas is rhyming womb
And how we get 'em out, we shake the room, c'mon
Shake

[Flava Flav (Bumpy Knuckles)]
Come on yo, let's go (shake the room)
We get it in baby, yo (shake the room)
Freddie Foxxx on the motherfucking floor (shake the room)
What the fuck do you motherfuckers know

[Outro: Bumpy Knuckles]
Word up
Bumpy Knuckles
DJ Premier

And what it means to shake the room
Is to get all the haters out of your space
Shake, shake, shake, shake, (shake the room)
Shake, shake, shake, shake, (louder)
Shake, shake, shake, shake, (shake the room)
Shake, shake, shake, shake
