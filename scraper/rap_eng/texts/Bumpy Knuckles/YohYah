[Verse 1]
What's really good? When a nigga from the hood
Make a couple of dollars and get a brand new Benz
Start losing friends or either they stuck to 'em
Long as he give a buck to 'em
Y'all know them niggas that always got the best plan
But need financial backing, lacking collateral
Everything is flattery, chargin' up the battery
Y'all niggas ain't gassin' me
I seen crews destroyed because of big egos
I seen Big destroyed because of his people
Black people, rap people
And we do it to ourselves every time, it's the rap sequel
Until the game is faded and the credits roll
Many wanna see they name, but never play the role
With faithful friends and strong protection
You could keep your life in the right direction
Pete Rock is the real Konexion
And DJ Premier is the Bump's KoleXXXion
That's why these niggas barely breakin' even
Show up at the table, low money
Fore the record is out you start thievin'

[Hook]
It's all good when niggas wanna see you drown
And don't come around when the money's down
I got love for you
I make this music and share my feelings
But keep my gun around for you
I just want to rock the microphone baby
Lay this down for you
Hip-hop for the haters
Yohyah yo yo yo yo yo yo, yohyah yo yo

[Verse 2]
Yo, why everybody A&Rs? Or even rap stars
And try to act like music has come that far
Do you know who you are? Do you know who they are?
What kind of niggas showed up on the radar
Yo Baby Pa pat 'em down, Suede check his man
Move like that with killers, cause we can
Bump on the stage and the beat is rockin'
Riders in the house cause of Biz & Rocky
Hip-hop wanna be, stand far away from the
Hip-hop raw emcee
I know you would kill to be as raw as me
We spit tickets for flights cause there's more to see
So turn it up and let's blast these haters out the room
Then wipe 'em off the deck, get 'em off your neck
Pick the way you find your friends or it'll destroy your future
Cause he'll be the closest to you to shoot you

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Yo, love ain't betrayal, betrayal is hate
That cause some cats to do things they can't take back
So watch who, watch your back
And the nigga who watch him
Get somebody else that could watch that
I seen it with Cena, jealousy formed
When me and John Cena formed a brotherly bond
Some people too much into status
So they never sit right with the fact that you the baddest
Word up, jealousy is just a germ in the blood stream
That won't let you put loyalty above things
In the right place, where it ought to be
If the play is confusing, call an audible
I work hard so lifestyle's affordable
I spit hard so micstyle's recordable
And must I remind you again
About that 44 Magnum travelin', portable

[Hook]
