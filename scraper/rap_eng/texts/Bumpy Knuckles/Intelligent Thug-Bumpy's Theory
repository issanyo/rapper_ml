Alright, check it see
A lot of times rapppers use the word thug very loosely
Like they use the word "love," you know what I'm saying?
And people outside of the circle start to believe that thugs are unintelligent people who don't really know nothing
But I'm gonna show them different I'm gonna show them how intelligent and how smart a thug is
Check it out, a thug will see, like, a rapper, right, with a deal, he'll see
Or go to one of the shows and see that he really don't got no muscle
He got lyrics, you know, good deal, driving in limos and all that but he ain't got no muscle
His crew is weak, so what he'll do is he'LL slide in and say, "Look here man you know what I mean
I've been feeling your shit, you spit that gangsta shit"
And he'll start planting a seed in his head that he's the same type of nigga as a street nigga, which is not so
And what happen then is that this nigga starts spitting on his record that he's a killer, he's a gangsta, he's selling xyz, and the bottom line is he's a cold coward and being a coward you know he's going to fall victim to it cause he's scarred to go against a nigga who's a real killer anyway

So this nigga get's up on them and starts telling em all these stories about how he's live and all that
And when it's time to throw down and put your hands up he ain't gonna do that, he ain't gonna bust his gun
He ain't gonna do shit but the fucked up part is he'll get the blame
The law will come at him, he'll pay for all the lawyers
He'll be the one sitting in jail with all that street credibility
But he really ain't that his heart really ain't there
So my point is who's the smart motherfucker here, the thug who sits back and not only does he know about the music business but he got in for free
He ain't have to do nothing for
So now you got a bunch of thugs in the game and I respect that more than that chump ass mo fucka gettin on the record talking all that other bullshit
