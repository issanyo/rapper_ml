[Intro]
That's right
Aiyyo Primo...watch this
"Lazy!!!"
See I know there's a lot of rappers right
You give 'em some real akward shit like this
And what they do they come back cryin' like;
"I can't see it I can't feel it"
What it is though, is this "Lazy!!!"
See it's to make 'em lazy crazy "Lazy!!!"
This hot shit right here
Let's make 'em motherfuckin' lazy "Lazy!!!"
So here's how I'mma to flip it for you
Check this out

[Verse 1]
I make short people pay me cause that's way I MAKE MY EARNINGS
Keep it right you keep your life
I don't wanna be in front of your house WITH MY FOUR POUNDS BURNIN'
Cause I will give you a light
I'mma hardcore nigga from downtown so NIGGAS CAN FEEL ME
Cause I'm hard when I deliver
But I won't stop rockin that hard sound SO NIGGAS CAN'T PEEL ME
I bring god when I deliver
I'm straight from the strongest isle AND I GOT NO FEAR B
And get wild in any burrow
To my warriors on Rikers Isle I HOPE YOU ALL CAN HEAR ME
Make 'em knife and be this thorough
We're a nation of hip hop but everybody down ain't ROLLIN'
Cause it's Bump takin' the lead
I'm not down with ya hypocrisy FUCK AROUND GET STOLEN
Cause I peal niggas for greed
Stop grinnin' in a motherfucker face WHEN YOU KNOW YOU DON'T LIKE ME
You get slapped the bitchy way
You can put a bunch of brawl in your voice BUT YOU DON'T SOUND LIKE ME
You'll get chased er witcha way
If you beefin on my 2-way PLEASE BE A THUG AND SIGN IT!
Cause it's gay for you to hide
I put your body in the river N-Y-P-D WON'T FIND IT
And I pray for you to die
I'm Bump nigga how many times I got to tell you BUMPY
Freddie Foxxx his other half
And I'll thump nigga right from the heart SO YOU NIGGAS CAN'T JUMP ME
I don't waste none the air baby "Lazy!!!"

[Hook] (2x)
Everybody you know, everybody we know (Come on, that's right)
Wanna spit a rhyme on a beat by the Primo "Lazy!!!"
But everybody I know and everybody you know
Know that's one thing everybody can't do though "Lazy!!!"

[Verse 2]
Bump bringin' you another selection FROM MY MAIN MAN PRIMO
To the heart forever Pearl
For blessin' hip hop with the one nigga PRODUCERS CAN'T SEE THOUGH
To the end she'll be our girl
If it takes me a lifetime to prove I'm THE NICEST MC
Then I'm down for every war
And if it ever get bigger than rap THEN I GET MY SHIT B
Come on down, I'm holdin' fours
I hate to be pain in the ass CAUSE IT REALLY AIN'T LIKE ME
But I couldn't help but notice
You come into this game with a mask AND SNEAK AROUND LIKE WIFEY
And get popped like shooky sodas
Rap voters get Al Gored, which means low scores
On all the music awards
It's all good though, niggas from the street DON'T SWEAT NO TROPHY
Cause it don't make you hot
Aiyyo Roy I'm the heavyweight champ of hip hop WALK LIGHTLY
Some of y'all must've forgot
Means nothing to me if another nigga got a Knuckle CAN TRUST ME
And I swear that forever
Cause I ever take a ass-whipping dude YOU WOULD HAVE TO BUST ME
Pretty much I'm sayin'; Whatever
See I punish MC's that come in with big dough
Cause I know they gonna pay they way right through flow
These Hollywood niggas from the hood better know
I'm so ever so forever flow
Always quick to respond I'm never slow
I'm probably something you don't wanna do, let it go
Basketball players, boxers, wrestlers
Don't take it personal cause I'll get the best of ya
Ask these sorry-ass RAPPERS
They know I'm so CRAZY

[Hook]
