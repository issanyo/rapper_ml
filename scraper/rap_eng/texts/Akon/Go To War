Ya wanna go to war lets get it then
If war bring peace im wit it then
I don't start beef i finish it
Ghetto soldiers, we militant
[Akon:]
I dont like to fuss or fight
Just trying to live life rightt
Don't take my kindness for weakness
Cuz i will take your life....
At first i will walk away...
Unless they push me to play
But thats something I know you will regret
So please dont forget
[Akon:]
Im a ghetto soldier, desporatoOoOo
Im a ghetto soldier, (dont man say nooOoo)
Im a ghetto soldIER, (how white say nooOoo)
Yes a ghetto soldier, (black man say nooOoo)
Got an S on my chest hahaha
[Papoose:]
The soldiers get trained by the leutinent
The leutinent get all of his orders from the captain
General, when i was young i got drafted
Sent me to the army of Brooklyn, those bastards
Full of soldiers, my homies lay in caskets
They couldn't survive the heat
Just like the mavericks
And I dont buy wolf tickets from niggas
But niggas be wolfin so i walk around on my clippers
Some of my people was alive from my struggle
But ain't lived to see my success
They wanted to see me make it, but got stripped naked
And layed in the mall cuz of death
So yo now im successful how can i celebrate it?
They died early, so in their eyes I never made it
I ain't goin' give you my life, you gotta take it
Soldier, I'm going out Blazin'

[Papoose:]
We said the same thing at the same time
I ain't knock on wood
Black cat crossed my path, my luck still good
Brook a mirror, i ain't get 7 years of bad luck
Nuttin bad ain't even happened, my left eye jumped
Put my hat on the bed when i walked in the room
Swept my feet, and i ain't even spit on the broom
What im try'na say is, Im not supersticious
Akon what am I ?
(Im a ghetto soldier)
My right hand itchin, been havin money kid
I even opened the unbrella in da crib
Bought my girl some shoes, she ain't walk outta my life
No bad luck, I skipped the po twice
No superstition, just wise intuition
On the battle field get killed or do the killin
By the way my good luck charm is a bisquit
Ghetto soldier to the ended
[Akon:]
Im a ghetto soldier, desporatoOoOo
Im a ghetto soldier, (dont man say nooOoo)
Im a ghetto soldIER, (how white say nooOoo)
Yes a ghetto soldier, (black man say nooOoo)
(hey!)
[Papoose:]
No pain no gain
All of the trama is killing me
Pain can't swim thats why I drown in that Hennesey
Tired of the enemy, runnin to your crib
Slumped you in your fireplace and have smoke comin outta
Your chimney
I could see straight through your plast? and your trickory
It dont mean shit to me, im trying to get to the bottom of it
But I lost a whole lot of my energy
Tryna get to the bottom of a bottomless industry
Now-a-days all i got is my pride and my dignity
You ridin with sympathy
They say misery needs company, why people company
You kiddin' me, when I could grab a weapon and put him outta his misery
Says shots asked you to tell you Im not playing!
When you fire back you let me know what chu saying
This gun busting its like an unspoken language
We communicate with our guns, this shit is dangerous
[Akon:]
Im a ghetto soldier, desporatoOoOo
Im a ghetto soldier, (dont man say nooOoo)
Im a ghetto soldIER, (how white say nooOoo)
Yes a ghetto soldier, (black man say nooOoo)
(Ya know)
