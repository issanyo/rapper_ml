[Intro]
You know they don't wanna see us together
You know they don't wanna see us together
You know they don't wanna see us together
But it don't matter, no
You know they don't wanna see us together
But it don't matter, no, 'cause I got you
'Cause I got you
'Cause I got you
'Cause I got you
'Cause I got you
'Cause I got you
I got you
'Cause I got you
I got you
'Cause I got you

[Chorus]
One way or another, I'ma love you
Slidin' under covers, undercover
They don't wanna see it happen—but we say, "Fuck it"
They don't wanna see it happen—but we say, "Fuck it"
One way or another, I'ma love you
Slidin' under covers, undercover
They don't wanna see it happen—but we say, "Fuck it"
They don't wanna see it happen—but we say, "Fuck it"

[Outro]
'Cause I got you
'Cause I got you
'Cause I got you
One way or another, 'cause I got you
One way or another, 'cause I got you
One way or another, 'cause I got you
One way or another, 'cause I got you
I got you
I got you
'Cause I got you
