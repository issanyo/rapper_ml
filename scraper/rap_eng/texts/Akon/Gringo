[Intro]
Konvict music upfront
Gotta get my block sold up... ya know me
Gotta get my block sold up... ya know me

[Hook]
Eyo gringo (gringo), eyo gringo (gringo)
I heard you want some marijuana (marijuana)
Want some pure white coca (coca)
Eyo gringo (gringo), eyo gringo (gringo)
You see I've never been a smoker (smoker)
I'm just your neighborhood dealer (dealer)

[Bridge]
And I'm tryin' to keep my block sold up
Tryin' to keep my block sold up
Tryin' to keep my block sold up
Tryin' to keep my block sold up
Tryin' to keep my block sold up
Tryin' to keep my block sold up
Tryin' to keep my block sold up
Tryin' to keep my block sold up

[Verse 1]
See I woke up early as hell one morning
And I noticed my stash was half gone (half gone)
Cause these fiends can't stop smokin my rocks
Cause lately around my way these niggas been warrin'
Fightin' for teritory that's mine (that's mine)
Cause these cats can't stop liquors or shots
I'ma show you right now the only reason the block is movin'
I got dubs at the price of a dime (a dime)
That's why I'm on top and it don't stop
Cause I get it so cheap no matter what I won't be losin'
Re-up spots is so hard to find
But I got one , cool ass mexican

[Hook + Bridge]

You can find me on the other side of the border
With a hundred grand in my pocket (a pocket)
For the first trip just pack a little bit
Cause I'ma bring the work back by air or even by water
What ever it take to get to the crib (the crib)
Gotta play it safe cause they out there
See I got so much clientele home waiting
I can't just make one trip (one trip)
But I gotta get enough to supply the city
But I gotta be careful smugglin' in
Vaseline Reynolds Wrap to hide the scent
Off on the next trip while I wait for Jose
He'll bring it to me

[Hook + Bridge]

[Outro]
Cause I'm a konvict (ae)
Never gonna be a convict (ae)
Cause I'm a konvict (ae)
Never gonna be a convict (ae)
