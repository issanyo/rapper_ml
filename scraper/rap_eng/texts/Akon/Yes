[Intro]
Your body's tellin' me yes, tellin' me yes
Your eyes are tellin' me yes, tellin' me yes

[Verse 1]
Don't give it to me easy, make me work a little
We move aside, aside and you work the middle
That was one word to describe your ways
It's a [?]
I'm a teapot, come on, blow the kettle

[Pre-Chorus]
I see the trouble that you're trying to make
I see you're doing what your lips won't say
Baby, I ain't gettin' in your way, in your way

[Chorus]
Your body's tellin' me yes, tellin' me yes
Your eyes are tellin' me yes, tellin' me yes
So you don't have to say words to me
No, you don't have to say
Your body's tellin' me yes, tellin' me yes

[Verse 2]
If you say you can't do it then you better do it
'Cause I'ma take your word, I'ma hold you to it
Soon as you start steppin' in the place
You put all [of my other girls?] to shame
Now I already know who I'm leavin' with

[Pre-Chorus]
I see the trouble that you're trying to make
I see you're doing what your lips won't say
Baby, I ain't gettin' in your way, in your way

[Chorus]
Your body's tellin' me yes, tellin' me yes
Your eyes are tellin' me yes, tellin' me yes
So you don't have to say words to me
No, you don't have to say
Your body's tellin' me yes, tellin' me yes

[Bridge]
I see the trouble that you're trying to make
I see you're doing what your lips won't say
Baby, I ain't gettin' in your way, in your way

[Chorus]
Your body's tellin' me yes, tellin' me yes
Your eyes are tellin' me yes, tellin' me yes
So you don't have to say words to me
No, you don't have to say
Your body's tellin' me yes, tellin' me yes

[Outro]
Tellin' me yes, tellin' me yes
Your eyes are tellin' me yes, tellin' me yes
