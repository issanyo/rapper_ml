She on the pole, watch her break it down
Her booty swole, her ass shake the ground
Pop that booty now, pop that, pop that booty now
Pop that booty now, pop pop pop that booty now
Breezy in this bitch, I make 'em yell, I make 'em holler
What you talkin' 'bout? Hell yeah, I got them dollars
And money on they mind, money money on they mind
And my presidents is goin' in the air when she whine on my
Potty mouth, she's from the south, she's dancin' on my whoa
After that, I give her more bread then she dances on Polow
Up and down just like pogo, give her more money then she go
On the floor, on the floor, take it down, take it down, down low
For all the strippers that's on my hitlist, watch how many racks I blow
They say this liquor is bad for my kidneys, I know, I know, I know
And I got 'em all takin' off their clothes and I got 'em all workin' on that pose
I'm the bomb like napalm, Akon what you're waitin' on? Leggo

[Hook: Akon]
Take it down, take it down, take it down, take it down low
Take it down, take it down, take it down, take it down low
