I'm facin' trouble everyday
Tryna' walk away from a life of sorrow
It's a struggle everyday
Trying not to rob G's, still I borrow

[Verse 1:]
I need to take it slow
My heart is growing cold
I'm tryna' hide my feelings
From the people that I know
And everywhere I go I'm trying to lay low
Can't afford to get in no trouble cuz I'm on parole

I'm tryna' live life right
God knows with all my might
But I'm just barely getting by
Cuz money's way too tight
And I can say this right
The struggle and the fight
It's weakin' all the muscles in my body like kryptonite
It's making me feel like there is no other way
But the different streets get that dough
Got me hopin' and then prayin' for a better day...So!

[Hook: x2]
I'm facin' trouble everyday
Tryna' walk away from a life of sorrow
It's a struggle everyday
Trying not to rob G's, still I borrow

[Verse 2:]
Streets, I ain't no longer on it
Don't need feds all upon it
I done left that life alone
Cuz all I did was impress, my homie!
And then my conscience told me
"Careful you tendarone!"
Always complaining after I ain't never did
She always lonely. So what am I to do
Gotta get money for food, cuz if she starves to death
Then I gotta deal with her attitude
And I in that type of mood cuz I ain't type of dude
It's bad enough, I gotta deal with all this I'm going through
It's making me feel like there is no other way
But to hit the streets and get that dough
Got me hopin' and then prayin' for a better day...So!

[Hook: x4]
I'm facin' trouble everyday
Tryna' walk away from a life of sorrow
It's a struggle everyday
Trying not to rob G's, still I borrow
