[Intro]
These children are living in a world where their friends, their brothers, their sisters, their cousins, their classmates are dying violently
They are trying to live with good thoughts, with hope, and with vibrancy in a world that offers them that
Our only, only choice is to stand in here with them and to say you're right, you can hope for a better life, you can do it differently
Miss Shakur did not go on a rampage about the people who shot her son

[Verse 1: The Game]
I'm feeling like a muthafuckin' boss bangin' 2Pac
High as a muthafuckin' Queensbridge rooftop
Blowing on this purple haze, feelin' invincible
Sellin' dope, never snitch, hood nigga principles
Abide by it, live by it, die by it, nigga
Even when I'm finga fuckin' hoes, finga on tha trigga
Diamonds in my crucifix, feelin' like a priest
Open the doors of my garage, see that '92 Caprice
Soldier for the cause, don't leave home without the strap
Know the map like the back of my hand, therefore I trap
See them cars and them street bikes, shining under street lights
Blowing on this peace pipe, welcome to the street life

[Chorus: Akon]
Can't sleep through the night
Man, you better believe that I'm a street rider
Can't sleep through the night
I keep it tucked in my sleeves cause I'm a street rider (Uh-huh)
I'm a hustla, ghetto entrepreneur (Uh-huh)
And addicted to money, cars and hoes (Uh-huh)
Got my toolie tucked and ready to draw (Uh-huh)
With a middle finger up, screamin', 'fuck that law!' (Uh-huh)

[Verse 2: The Game]
The Phantom can't hold me, so I went and bought a Spider
Nigga, I Swizz Beatz like a fucking Ruff Ryder
Can-am engine, suicide rims
Niggas can't live wit' it: commit suicide then
Wish cancer on a hater, wish AIDs on a slut
Take the ride kill me 'cause ain't a bitch that I trust
I'm just rollin' up this kush, 'bout to crash my girl truck
Her friend texted me tryna to kick it like the world cup
She just tryna get some ace of spades, tryna hit the blunt
She a cunt, hit her once and call her ass next month
See these bitches tryna stunt and these niggas stay hatin'
See my watch a cold bitch, call that hoe Sarah Palin
All my albums went platinum, nigga, thanks to the block
Voice raspy as ever, nigga, thanks to them shots
Back reppin' Aftermath, nigga, thanks to the Doc
And these hoes in my Panamera thanks to Ciroc

[Chorus: Akon]
Can't sleep through the night
To all of my gangstas, street rider
Can't sleep through the night
Goin' out to mu hustlas, street rider (Uh-huh)
I'm a hustla, ghetto entrepreneur (Uh-huh)
And addicted to money, cars and hoes (Uh-huh)
Got my toolie tucked and ready to draw (Uh-huh)
With a middle finger up, screamin', 'fuck that law!' (Uh-huh)

[Verse 3: Nas]
I switch from chillin'
Cause rappers harassin' me, illin'
They rich, infatuated by just casually livin'
The bitch could have a threesome with 'em, so now they pimpin'
Lil' monkey, that's how a king is 'pose to be
How you open, when she willin'
Let me take you to '87
14 years old, I was a ladies legend
38, a bird in the safe, '98 Oldsmobile
I ain't frontin', I don't know Pharrell
He wear pastel colors
I wear the pain of the Soledad brothers
And them chrome gat busters
An R&B wife on the arm, I close shop
I showed niggas they first Bentley, fuck I window shop
Show niggas they first ice, now they like, 'I love you'
Remember when they hustle, was tryna sue Russell
For what other nigga did to him, sounds sickenin'
That's why I cut him off, word to God, he was snitchin' then

[Chorus: Akon]
Can't sleep through the night
Goin' out to my gangstas, street rider (Out to my gangstas, yeah)
Can't sleep through the night
Goin' out to my hustlas, street rider (Goin' out to my hustlas, uh-huh)
I'm a hustla, ghetto entrepreneur (Uh-huh)
And addicted to money, cars and hoes (Uh-huh)
Got my toolie tucked and ready to draw (Uh-huh)
With a middle finger up, screamin', 'fuck that law!' (Uh-huh)

[Outro: Akon]
When I can't sleep through the night
Keep my eyes wide open, street rider (My eyes wide open, yeah)
Can't sleep through the night
When have you known me for jokin'? (When have you known me for jokin'?)
Street rider (uh-huh)
I'm a hustla, ghetto entrepreneur (Uh-huh)
And addicted to money, cars and hoes (Uh-huh)
Got my toolie tucked and ready to draw (Uh-huh)
With a middle finger up, screamin', 'fuck that law!' (Uh-huh)
