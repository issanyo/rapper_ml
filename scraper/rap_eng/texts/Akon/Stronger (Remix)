[Verse 1: D1]
Used to say I don't love them ho's
I would fuck em then duck em like punches thrown
If the numbers unknown, wouldn't touch the phone
Kept em at a distance like too much cologne
Till I met this bad chick who ain't never had shit
Mom died young and her Dad was mad sick
Somethin bout a life that was so tragic
Kept me comin back like elastic, might have passed if
She didn't soothe my soul through the night like Gladys
Cause livin in the dark, man the lime light clashes
It flashes and blinds you, and even when ya eyes adjust
Lack of trust still contrasts to remind you
I said "How the hell'd I find you?"
Well, that was an answer that I knew
But I get so lost when I'm inside you
Now I promise I ain't boltin like Michael
Recycle our love, we can't throw it away
Now we always keep it tight like rollin a J
What can I say? Sometimes the heart gets what it wants
She wasn't my type so she switched up the font
Now she's always on my mind like the top of my skull
She's a hell of a catch and I ain't droppin the ball
She's gotta stand tall to show she's stronger than all
But I don't want her to fall, nah

[Hook: Akon]
She'll do whatever
To hold on longer
It makes her stronger
What makes her hold on to it
And continue latching on (to it)
To hold on longer
It makes her stronger
Why she has to pursue it
Won't stop before she cries fluid
For love

[Verse 2: Suai]
Nothing in this world's too hard
When you've been through it all
No where is ever too far
For me to catch u when u fall
You'll never understand
What i've gone through with so far
How this woman loves her man

She'll give up all that shes got
When it comes to what she loves
Whether it's right or it's not
Oh even though she don't fit that glove
She'll do everything she can
Nothing could ever be 2 much
When a woman loves her man

[Hook]
She'll do whatever
To hold on longer (longer)
It makes her stronger (stronger)
What makes her hold on to it (to it)
And continue latching on (to it)(to it)
To hold on longer (longer)
It makes her stronger (stronger)
Why she has to pursue it (pursue it)
Won't stop before she cries fluid (fluid..)
For love

[Verse 3: Suai]
Ain't no limit to the things i'd do
My heart's been broke, torn apart for u
You ask do i care?
Just know id do it again
Ain't no limit to the things i'd do
My heart's been broke, torn apart for u
If you ask why i care?
Just know id do it again
Yeah-ah

[Bridge: Akon]
Oh oh oh
Cuz that's why I love ya
Oh oh oh
And I'm gonna be witcha forever
Oh oh oh
Cuz that's how much i need ya
Oh oh oh

[Hook]
Cuz she'll do whatever
To hold on longer
It makes her stronger
What makes her hold on to it
And continue latching on (to it)
To hold on longer
It makes her stronger
Why she has to pursue it
Won't stop before she cries fluid
For love

[Outro: Suai]
Hotter than flames from the sun
(stronger)
Deeper than any ocean
(she's stronger)
Is anyone stronger than
(stronger)
When a woman loves her man
(stronger)
