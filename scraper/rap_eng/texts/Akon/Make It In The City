This for all my grinders world wide
Keep Your Head Up

I’m just a thug on the other side of the law
Raised in the hood, never thought I’d make it this far
I went from standing on the block dealing, totting my Glock
Weighing product on a triple beam
I even got hassled a lot, mainly by crooked cops
Life wasn’t easy as it seems!

Chorus:
Trying to make it in a city
Where we stay on the grind
Stay on the grind, stay on the grind
Trying to make it in a city
Where we stay on the grind
Stay on the grind, stay on the grind
Trying to make it in a city
Where we stay on the grind
Stay on the grind, stay on the grind
Trying to make it in a city
Where we stay on the grind
Stay on the grind, stay on the grind

Gets harder everyday to come up with the rent
And ain’t got a job (ain’t got a job)
Trying to keep the bills paid
But don’t wanna get locked up no more! (locked up no more)
See my Parolee Officer almost caught me with that stuff
Tossed it so he wouldn’t find a trace! (wouldn't find a trace)
Not to mention my baby mama, the bitch is greedy as fuck
Got child support steady on my case

Chorus:
Trying to make it in a city
Where we stay on the grind
Stay on the grind, stay on the grind
Trying to make it in a city
Where we stay on the grind
Stay on the grind, stay on the grind
Trying to make it in a city
Where we stay on the grind
Stay on the grind, stay on the grind
Trying to make it in a city
Where we stay on the grind
Stay on the grind, stay on the grind

Gotta a little personal but let me break it down
I’m not the only one out here that’s going through it now
It’s international, recession's all around
We gotta be here for each other when it hit the ground
I know your hurtin' (hurtin') and workin' (workin')
Don't give up it will all work out (work out)
Can’t ever stop hopin' (hopin'), for certain (certain)
I’ll be grinding until the day that I die!

Chorus:
Trying to make it in a city
Where we stay on the grind
Stay on the grind, stay on the grind
Trying to make it in a city
Where we stay on the grind
Stay on the grind, stay on the grind
Trying to make it in a city
Where we stay on the grind
Stay on the grind, stay on the grind
Trying to make it in a city
Where we stay on the grind
Stay on the grind, stay on the grind
