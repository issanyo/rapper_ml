[Verse 1]
Im like a bird and I am so high
In my lair looking at the blue sky
Can't let another day pass by
Without you knowing what I feel inside
Cause its embedded in my soul
The day I stop will be the day I turn cold
Let you know I'm breaking out of that hole
And let go

[Pre-Chorus 1]
So I can be free to do what means most to me
And you can look back one day
And know I shared with you my gift
I hope you wouldn't think I just leave
Pack up and roll up my sleeve
Give it all up and live for nothing to take with me all I got to give

[Chorus]
Thats why
I just want to make you clap again
Just clap again
I just want to make you clap again
Just clap again
I just want to make you clap again
Just clap again
I just want to make you clap again
Just clap again

[Verse 2]
So if your life is twisted and ain't going right
Let's forget about it tonight
I just wanna make you happy baby
Dancing and clapping (dancing and clapping)
Cause we plan to be here till the morning light
Can you feel the change in your life?
Ain't it feeling like magic baby?
I'm the one that make it happen baby

[Pre-Chorus 2]
So you can be free to do what was meant to be
And you can look back one day
And know I shared with you my gift
Would you think I just leave?
Pack up and roll up my sleeve
Give it all up and live for nothing to take with me all I got to give

[Chorus x2]
