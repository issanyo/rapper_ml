(But I love you)
I had my doubts before
I thought it through, now I'm gone for sure

I hope for goodness sake
That you would just cheat, make some mistake
(But I love you)
So perfect, [Incomprehensible]
You gave me no reason to escape
(But I love you)
Won't hide, I got skirts to chase
Don't wanna be throwin? it in your face
(But I love you)
I pray to God some days
We fight and go our separate ways
What's love gotta do with it
Gotta do with it, gotta do with it?
What's love gotta do with it
Gotta do with it, gotta do with it?
