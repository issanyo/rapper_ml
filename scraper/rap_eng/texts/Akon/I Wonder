Sometimes I wonder
Is it the place we live
That make us a Gangsta, Make us a hustla...
Creating the problem..

Creating the problem..
I gotta know right now

[Verse 1: Dolla]
I was raised in a broken home
Daddy died when I was 5
Mama raises 3 kids on her own
At the tender age of 23 against all odds
I seen her baging up weed when them times got hard
I'm on my knees, prayin to god
Askin the lord why she gotta work 3 jobs
It's the end of the month, we waiting on the 1st
E.B.T. still comin but it could be worse
Sometimes I sit and wonder if the way I was raised
Is a reflection on the way I behave
I'm stuck in my ways....just the child of the struggle
Otherwise I woulda stayed outta trouble

[Verse 2: Dolla]
Maybe I'm a victim of circumstances
If I was raised in the Hamptons, I'd be on campus
On somebodys college, doctor or lawyer
Instead I'm on a corner, the Eastside of Georgia
We all given choices and I made mine but sometimes
I think If I was from the other side of town
My homies wouldn't be dead, locked in them cells
It's hard to see heaven when you growing up in hell
I can't prevail cus round here drugs is all we sell
On top of that I'm a young black male
I can't get a brake cus my skin ain't pale
Another statistic, they wanna see me fail

[Verse 3: Dolla]
Maybe I got to my environment
If I wasn't from the ghetto I wouldn't be so violent
If I didn't have the weight on my shoulders
I wouldn't grow stronger, as I grew older
Now I see my surroundings, made me who I am
At such a young age I was forced to be a man
Mama did the best she can and this I know
When you scared around here you can't let that show
Only the strong survive, the weak get ate
End up dead or In jail from the decisions we make
If I had both parents, things would be different
But I don't so I'm sitting here wishing
