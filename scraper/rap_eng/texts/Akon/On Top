I like to watch your body move when you're ridin' on top
On top, on top, on top, eh
I like to watch your body move when you're ridin' on top
On top, on top, on top
Movin' them hips, ride me ever so slowly
Actin' so grown and sexy, you know what I wanna see
I like to watch your body move when you're ridin' on top
On top, on top, on top, eh
Look at how she make it move like jelly, man
You know I gotta get a shot with a steady cam
You can have a brother coming out the pelle pants
If I gotta keep on looking at the way you belly dance
She got a cute portfolio
Fast like a NASCAR like she drove before
Because I can tell by the way she ride that stick
That she ride that dick like a rodeo, eh
On top while I'm huggin' them thighs
And you know I like looking at what I do see
I try to hit it from the bottom
But she told me to be real still 'cause she wanna do me
Like a gangster when I touch her
Thought I was rough, but she was rougher
She cut me, I didn't cut her
We tradin' places like Usher
She drop to the floor with an ease
Come and rock my boat like Aaliyah
If you can grind on me like Shakira
With you on top, then I just might see ya
He don't really know the way you can work
He said he ain't hit it good while he was at you
But you be givin' me the vision of a freak
So I gotta lay back, I wanna see what that do 'cause
I like to watch your body move when you're ridin' on top
On top, on top, on top, eh
I like to watch your body move when you're ridin' on top
On top, on top, on top
Movin' them hips, ride me ever so slowly
Actin' so grown and sexy, you know what I wanna see
I like to watch your body move when you're ridin' on top
On top, on top, on top, eh
I feel it how you bump and grind with the twist
Come and slide with the twist, if you ain't got plans
How you doin'? And I knew that she was ready
When I saw the way the fatty look in them black pants
And you know that I know would be good
When you be on top and giving me a lap dance
You move your body like a choreographer
I would lay down and watch if I got that chance
I would be owing you an apology for thinkin' I'ma be better
But I'm lovin' the way she rockin' me
Possibly I could be up in the Odyssey
For my good the bottom be when I let her get on top of me
I knew that she was hidin' a bumper when she got in the truck
I wanted to hit it after sippin' the yak in the cup
I like the way the booty look when she backin' it up
Come with me and let's get buck in the back of the bus
A good time, are you with that there?
Come and give it to me 'cause I gotta get that there
New beau was here, go and sit that there
Then pop this here, let me hit that there
So sexy, a vial of 5'8"
When she ride me, she make her body vibrate
When I'm looking at her, I never get irate
When she got on top of me and then gyrate
I like to watch your body move when you're ridin' on top
On top, on top, on top, eh
I like to watch your body move when you're ridin' on top
On top, on top, on top
Movin' them hips, ride me ever so slowly
Actin' so grown and sexy, you know what I wanna see
I like to watch your body move when you're ridin' on top
On top, on top, on top, eh
