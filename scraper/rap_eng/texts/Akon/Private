OC(huh)
Its about to get hot!
US(huh)
Its about to get hot!
All this (huh)
And the beat it don't stop
We keep rockin it
We keep rockin it

Everybody watching her
The way she sway to the beat
From the left to the right
Tryin to see what up with her
Who's the lucky man who gonna have a wild for the night
I wanna say she's eyein me
But I can't really tell cause its dark in the place
So I'm watching shorty quietly
And I'm thinkin to myself should I chill or should I chase

I could tell by the way she looked at me
She was somebody who could be
The type that I need in my world
