Ok, this shit is so random
And when I'm with you
Its like our heart beats, are in tandem
And when our lips lock
I just wanna hold your face for ransom
You're beautiful and I'm handsome
That'll be good for the babies
If ever we go there maybe!
It's crazy, no titles but your my baby
When I'm idle that's your time
Show time, and for you, I wish I had more time
Red wine, chocolate
Baby you could be my Valentine
More than just sex exchanged, baby you my Boo Thang

Hey, girl, so glad that I've found ya!
Uh huh! Tell your friends, they're leaving without ya!
Got a hotel room with a view of the city that I know you gonna like
Got the candles leading to the bathtub baby, let's hop inside!
Ride in the two door with the roof gone
My oh my, baby it's been too long
So grab your coat and your purse
I'll walk out of here first
Wait about five and I'll be parked outside!

I know we ain't got no strings attached
But this could be a perfect match!
And girl, we ain't no cuddie buddies
Cause this is way more than that!

You're my boo thang
Can't get enough, I love yo stuff!
Let's turn it up, you get what you want
Cause you're my boo thang
And when your friends ask
I'm not ya man just the closest thing that you have!
To a boo thang, boo thang
Boo thang, boo thang
Boo thang, boo thang!

Hey, girl, I can't leave here without you, uh huh!
And how you're looking I love everything about you!
Girl it's more then your body, I'm making love to your mind
And every time that I want you
You're ready all of the time!

I know we ain't got no strings attached
But this could be a perfect match!
And girl, we ain't no cuddie buddies
Cause this is way more than that!
