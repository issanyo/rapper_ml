We making it cause we make it move

Come on baby and drop it
Scrub the floor and just mop it
Show these gangsters how you pop lock it
Don't care what you got in your pocket
I get the way that you rocking
Flip that thang thang don't stop it
When I just bang bang and pop it
While the club crowded just watch you (work it out)

Got a gang of cash and it's all thrown out on the bar (now work it out)
And it's going fast cause I feel like a superstar (now work it out)
And you may not have it, I might just broke the law (now work it out)
It's your time to grab it, now make this whole thing yours (now work it out)

Some pressure that we can push
Ladies can't get enough
Got my fitness, I'm looking buff
And all my people with me, I trust
Holding down for my city
If they asking you, I'm not guilty
All the thing that I'm guilty of is making you rock with me (work it out)

Got a gang of cash and it's all thrown out on the bar (now work it out)
And it's going fast cause I feel like a superstar (now work it out)
And you may not have it, I might just broke the law (now work it out)
