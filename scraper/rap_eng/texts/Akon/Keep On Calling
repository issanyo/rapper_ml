You know - Check!
It's Akon, man, and my man, P
It's the magic city, baby
Yeah, I think we got it one on this one
So when them haters wanna scream our name
(Let them keep on calling)
And they weren't supporting us before and then they wanna scream now?
(Let them keep on calling)
We just gon' let them keep on calling, baby, just keep calling
(So keep on calling)
And for our supporters
Ya'll know ya'll can just keep calling as long as you want
(Keep on calling)
I use to be up on the corner all day
Trying to figure out what's gon' get me out there
Dope dealing and hugging the block
I done found out they ain't gon' get me nowhere
Used to keep a nine milli' for protection
Just in case a nigga wanna take my bread
Then a voice came down from the sky and said
"Akon, use your head"
I had to re-evaluate my thoughts
And think about what got me this far
Had to keep a strong faith in believing
Know one day I'd be a star
But I knew that it wouldn't come easy
Seen a whole lot a hating, believe me
Despite all the bullshit, we had to still work hard
To get to where we are

[Chorus]
So when you hear them calling out "Akon"
Let them keep on calling
When you hear the world calling out "P-Money"
Let them keep on calling
'Cause we went through hell and back to get here
So keep on calling
Let me hear you now
Let me hear you now
Let me hear you just keep on calling
Senegal, West Africa, to New Zealand
Blessed to have the gift to make music with meaning
'Cause I never thought I'd come this far
With a mansion and a fancy car
Never thought success would come this quick in the beginning
But I've seen it
And all along, I'm sitting there thinking
It's harder when you came from the hood
And all I had to do was put my mind to it
And realise that it was all good
'Cause once I got rid of what held me down
Best believe I wasn't turning back
I had to keep on moving and then keep on grooving
Right here on this P-Money track

[Chorus]
And so when you hear them calling out "Akon"
Let them keep on calling
When you hear the world calling out "P-Money"
Let them keep on calling
'Cause we went through hell and back to get here
So keep on calling
Let me hear you now
Let me hear you now
Let me hear you just keep on calling
Keep on calling
Keep on calling
Just keep on calling
Keep on calling
Just keep on calling
Keep on calling
Just keep on calling
Keep on calling

[Chorus]
When you hear them calling out "Akon"
Let them keep on calling
When you hear the world calling out "P-Money"
Let them keep on calling
'Cause we went through hell and back to get here
So keep on calling
Let me hear you now
Let me hear you now
Let me hear you just keep on calling
