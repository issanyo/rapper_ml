[Verse 1:]
What have I missed living like this?
Who'd think I'd get this far
Fancy house and my fancy car

Why you living like this
Together as kids?
You were my best of friend
All the trouble you got up in

[Hook:]
See, I been deaf
And I been scared
I been discriminated against and compared
To you whose my brother
Thanks to you I discovered
There's only one way to go in life
And that's be right

[Chorus:]
There's only one way to do right (right, right, right)
There's only one way to do right (right, right, right)

See me, I ain't always done right (right, right, right)
That's why I'm here to help you fight (fight)
To do right

[Verse 2:]
You were the queen in my future
I was the one you was used to
It was like we were one
Up under the sun

And narcotics in your system
The love I should have i missed it
Now look what we've become
But I shouldn't judge

[Repeat Hook:]

[Repeat Chorus:]

[Bridge:]
'Cause in life
There are decisions to make
But it's your choice
But I chose to walk away rather than wilding out
And get locked away

See my friends all chose the fast money
But I chose my Father
'Cause I knew he'd come for me
And recover me, already dead

See what I'm trying to say is
I'm trying to be the best man I can be
And when I see you too
Struggling to do the best you can do

You may run into a rock
But you can't let it stop what's planned for you
So make the right choice

[Repeat Chorus 2x:]
