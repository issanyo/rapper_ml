It's been so long
That I haven't seen your face
I'm tryna' be strong
But the strength I have is washing away
It won't be long before I get you by my side
And just hold you, tease you, squeeze you, tell you
What's been on my mind

Girl, I know mistakes were made between us two
And we show our selfs that night even said somethings weren't true
Why'd you go and haven't seen my girl since then
Why can it be the way it was
'Cause you were my homie, lover, and friend
