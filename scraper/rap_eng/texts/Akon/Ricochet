[Hook]
Been here before
Pushed back, back and forth
That doesn't matter
This won't stop me
Nothing can drop me
It's still a struggle

Ricochet, ricochet, hit that wall and keep on moving
No obstacles stand in my way, hit that wall and keep on moving
Ricochet, ricochet, hit that wall and keep on moving
No obstacles stand in my way, hit that wall and keep on moving

[Verse 1]
Wherever I may go, whatever I might be
I may not stand alone but I am standing tall, ten toes two feet
I've never been a pushover, never asked for a handover
Worked nine five, broke day and night, if you only knew what I hurdled over

[Hook]
Been there before
Pushed back, back and forth
That doesn't matter
This won't stop me
Nothing can drop me
It's still a struggle

Ricochet, ricochet, hit that wall and keep on moving
No obstacles stand in my way, hit that wall and keep on moving
Ricochet, ricochet, hit that wall and keep on moving
No obstacles stand in my way, hit that wall and keep on moving

[Verse 2]
Ready to take blows, suited ...
... my hands are bruised but I am still gonna stay true
Motivated by ... and the names I salute
Unbreakable I made it through and there's so much more to do

[Hook]
Been here before
Pushed back, back and forth
That doesn't matter
This won't stop me
Nothing can drop me
It's still a struggle

Ricochet, ricochet, hit that wall and keep on moving
No obstacles stand in my way, hit that wall and keep on moving
Ricochet, ricochet, hit that wall and keep on moving
No obstacles stand in my way, hit that wall and keep on moving
