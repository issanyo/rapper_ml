Akon.. Antoine..

[Verse 1: Akon]
When you move I’m in another place
Want to get into your outer space (uh uh)
You're like the treble, I’m the bass
You never leave my mind without a trace (no)
When I take you to paradise
When I’m looking into your eyes
All I’m seeing is clear blue skies (woah)
I just wanna spend every day
With you loving up all on me
Can't believe this is my real life

[Chorus: Akon]
Underneath the soleil
We ain't in no hurry
You make every day a holiday
We can take it slowly
Be my one and only
Let's make every day a holiday
A holiday

[Bridge: Akon]
Aye aye aye ohhway, aye aye aye (hey)
Aye aye aye ohhway, aye aye aye (a holiday)

[Verse 2: Akon]
Girl you wear that sunshine when it rains
And you're taking all my stress away (woah)
How you put a smile up on my face, when I’m with you
No return trip, just one-way (girl)
When I take you to paradise
When I’m looking into your eyes
All I’m seeing is clear blue skies (woah)
I just wanna spend every day
With you loving up all on me
Can't believe this is my real life

[Chorus: Akon]
Underneath the soleil
We ain't in no hurry
You make every day a holiday
We can take it slowly
Be my one and only
Let's make every day a holiday
A holiday

Underneath the soleil
We ain't in no hurry
You make every day a holiday
We can take it slowly
Be my one and only
Let's make every day a holiday
A holiday

[Outro]
Aye aye aye ohhway, aye aye aye (AY)
Aye aye aye ohhway, aye aye aye (a holiday)
