You need to quit it, ohh
Girl you need to quit it

[Verse 1: Akon]
So many girls outside, and I wanna go take a cruise
And I know you a sex machine and I wanna do summin' new to you
The way you roll them thighs, and your girl doin' it too
If you want we can mix it up, I could set it up, she can get it too
We got plenty of drinks', plenty plenty of water
We got plenty of things comin' from Cal-ifornia
And we all got that bank so believe we can afford this
So stop, playin' and show me what you can do
And don't be actin' like that (like that) I know you wanna ride
Cause my Lamborghini doors go up and down
Now all these gorillas' here, all these women here
Somebody here gon' fuck

[Hook: Akon & T-Pain]
That's why I'm tryna holla holla (holla holla) holla holla (holla holla)
Holla holla (holla holla) holla holla (holla holla)
I'm tryna holla holla (holla holla) holla holla (holla holla)
Let me holla at you girl

[Verse 2: T-Pain]
I gotta big truck outside, and it sittin' on twentysixes
I'mma bout to step out my ride, with about twenty bitches
And they all like girls, so they all be kissin'
That's why I'm tryna put you in this, girl
While I'm up in this club, gotta get my groove on
If you wanna roll with a nigga, go with a nigga try to get a move on
And I hope that you like girls, cause I wanna see you kissin'
And now I'm tryna put you in my world
So don't be actin' like that (like that) I know you wanna ride
Cause my Lamborghini doors go up (and down)
(Now all these gorillas' here, all these women here)
Somebody here gon' fuck

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Akon]

Shawty I'm tryna do summin' to you, yeah

[Verse 4: T-Pain]
Shawty, Uh, I'm tryna holla holla

Actin' like that (like that) I know you wanna ride
Cause my Lamborghini (doors) go up (and down)
