Rubbin' on that Italian leather
Konvict Jeans on
Ay yo Weezy, you ready?
Yeah!

I get it in 'til the sun rise
Goin' 90 in a 65
Windows rolled down screamin' "Ah!"
Hey-ey-ey, I'm so paid

Number one hustler gettin' money
Why you wanna count my money?
I'm a hustler and don't need them
One of y'all, you see, I'm so paid

I see police on that crooked, I
Doin' 100 on Interstate 95
My shorty leanin', blastin' that 'Do Or Die'
Wishin' that a motherfucker would, 'cause we certified

Got a system that'll beat and knock your wall off
Got a pump under my seat, sawed-off
Got a bunch of goons, hope they never call off
I'm a sniper sittin' on the roof, already saw y'all

Ain't too much to put a strain on me
That's the reason why I had to put the blame on me
I'd rather have them dollar bills rain on me
Than to let them haters come and make a name off me

That's why I get it in 'til the sun rise
Doin' 90 in a 65
Windows rolled down screamin' "Ah!"
Hey-ey-ey, I'm so paid

Number one hustler gettin' money
Why you wanna count my money?
I'm a hustler and don't need them
One of y'all, you see, I'm so paid

I'm the boss, it only takes one call
For a driver to hit you up and drop you off and that's all
Guess what? I won't be takin' that fall
Homie, I got cake, that's what I'm payin' them for

Ha ha, ain't that funny?
'Cause niggas they want war but ain't got money
'Cause I've seen 'em all talk until they start gunnin'
Quicker than Usain Bolt, the fastest thing runnin'

Yeah, Akon! Weezy!
Block oil holdin' down Jersey
Devine makin' sure we gettin' it up front
My little brother Boo got that vision, baby

I get it in 'til the sun rise
Doin' 90 in a 65
Windows rolled down screamin' "Ah!"
Hey-ey-ey, I'm so paid

Number one hustler gettin' money
Why you wanna count my money?
I'm a hustler and don't need them
One of y'all, you see, I'm so paid

Ah-oh, big money Weezy
White wife-beater with the sig underneath it
How do I feel? Bitch, I feel undefeated
Snap my fingers, disappear from the precinct, yeah

I'm ballin', we ball out
Thoughts of we fallin' until the ball bounce
I send some niggas with guns at y'all house
Only to find out you live in a doll house

Damn! But I thought you was tough though
We carry choppers on our necks, call it cut throat
We bury powers on the set that they come from
We know magic turn weed smoke to gun smoke

We ball first when we ride
You in a Hearse when you ride
I put my shoe down baby
And I'm holdin' down Young Mula baby

That's why I get it in 'til the sun rise
Doin' 90 in a 65
Windows rolled down screamin' "Ah!"
Hey-ey-ey, I'm so paid

Number one hustler gettin' money
Why you wanna count my money?
I'm a hustler and don't need them
One of y'all, you see, I'm so paid
