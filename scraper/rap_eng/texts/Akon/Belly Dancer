Shake ya body like a belly dancer
Excuse me, beg your pardon girl
Do you have any idea what you startin' girl?
You got me tingling, come to me mingling
Steppin' off, lookin' bootylicious and jingling
When you walk, I see you baby girl
When you talk, I believe it baby girl
I like that, thick-petite n' pretty
Little touch is a ditty
Love to work the kitty like purr, she loves to stir it up purr
I can hear her purring up
Cause shes the type that'll get arousy of
Get you excited and call her boyfriend up
(Oh no)
What's the plan without the plan B
We can meet up at the hutter house for the TV
So stand by like a butty pass
While I watch this beautiful thang shake that ass

Girl, I must say you the flyest thang in here
So hot we gon' need some rain in here
Type to make ex-gangstas bang in here
Girl you could do anything you want in here
Clown if you want to, frown if you want to
You ain't even gotta drop down if you want to
Cause I'd rather see you shake it standin'
Either way you do it girl you look outstandin'
And now you got me spending
The way you got that body bendin
Ass like that girl you gotta be kickin'
And we goin' to church next day repentant
Lap dancing for my FA crew
Slide it ova to boo cause he want some too
Up in the VIP with no fee
Blessing you with the G even though we gettin' it free so

Whatever you do don't break your body, body
After the party party, grab a hottie hottie
In the back seat of your Maserati-rati
Jiggle jiggle it to the left

Jiggle it to the front then jiggle it to the back
And jiggle jiggle it all, all night
