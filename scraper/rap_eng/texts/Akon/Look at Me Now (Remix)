[Akon: Hook]

Dont know about you my nigga but the street's been good to me
Even took a whole lotta bullshit but it made me a stronger G
Dont know nuttin else but the street life when it come to me
I never thought I'd ever think about bitin' the hand that fed me
Look at me now
Lookin' for a way to get off the block
Said look at me now
This life I'm livin must stop. Man
Look at me now
Think about it each and every day
Look at me now...

[Obie Trice]
Obie Trice, real name no gimmicks
I came in the game profane, no image
I came in the game widda name I was given
From a mane
Who ain't give a fuck about his chitlin'
I proclaim the name though
Never in vain, no!
Watch the change grow
A young nigga who done gained from fame
Copped a range rov'
Now they want my brains on the main road
But they don't understand what I came fo'
I came forth, with a million sold
Who say you can't grow from mildew and mold?
Get money like Ross Perot
I'm often told, "A coffins the routes I go."
Oh, thats the road you on, oh no!
Im down for the rightful tone of .44
Don't never try to send a nigga home, no! no!
I know you wanna catch me at Sunoco
Show me that ya loco
Put holes in my photo
NOPE!
Ope
Hold toast no jokes since thugs beat the polo'

[Akon]
Stayin' here I'm just gettin much older
S'time to go stack up enough cheese
Hot Glocks just gettin' much colder, dodgin' and duckin' the police
How much longer must I stand on this corner?
I Gotta get off right away
How much longer must me see sell on this corner before they take my life away?

Dont know about you my nigga
But the street's been good to me
Even took a whole lotta bullshit but it made me a stronger G
