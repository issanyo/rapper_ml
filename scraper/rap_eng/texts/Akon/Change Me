[Chorus: Akon]
You know that I love you
You know that I love you
You know that I need you
You're my air that I breathe you
You know that I love you
You know that I love you
You know that I need you
You're my air that I breathe you

[Post-Hook: Akon]
So don't try to change me
So don't try to change me
Why would you change me?
Why would you change me? (baby, I will let you go)
So don't try to change me
So don't try to change me
Why would you change me?
Baby, I will let you go

[Verse 1: Keri Hilson]
You know I
I had my
My vices
You said you could handle it
But you lied
Cause you tried to change me
Mold me, no
Everything you loved before
You don't love no more
Everything I did for you
You don't want no more
Maybe I'm not quite the girl you been lookin' for
But you agreed
So how could you not see it?

[Chorus: Akon]
You know that I love you
You know that I love you
You know that I need you
You're my air that I breathe you
You know that I love you
You know that I love you
You know that I need you
You're my air that I breathe you
So don't try to change me
So don't try to change me
Why would you change me?
Why would you change me? (baby, I will let you go)
So don't try to change me
So don't try to change me
Why would you change me?
Baby, I will let you go

[Verse 2: Akon]
Why must I
Decide on
Whether I love you are the world
You met me
You fell deeply
In love with me
So what is the problem now?
Everything you loved before
You don't love no more
Everything I did for you
You don't want no more
Maybe I'm not quite the man you been lookin' for
But you agreed
So how could you not see it

[Chorus: Akon]
You know that I love you
You know that I love you
You know that I need you
You're my air that I breathe you
You know that I love you
You know that I love you
You know that I need you
You're my air that I breathe you
So don't try to change me
So don't try to change me
Why would you change me?
Why would you change me? (baby, I will let you go)
So don't try to change me
So don't try to change me
Why would you change me?
Baby, I will let you go

[Bridge: Keri Hilson]
Why would you wanna change me
Arrange me
Is that what you call love?
Maybe you need somebody different
Somebody who fits you like a glove
But don't change
Everything that you love
About me
When you love them

[Chorus: Akon]
You know that I love you
You know that I love you
You know that I need you
You're my air that I breathe you
You know that I love you
You know that I love you
You know that I need you
You're my air that I breathe you
So don't try to change me
So don't try to change me
Why would you change me?
Why would you change me? (baby, I will let you go)
So don't try to change me
So don't try to change me
Why would you change me
Baby, I will let you go
So don't try to change me
