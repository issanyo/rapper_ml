[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown]
It ain't nothing to make you want it
Get you tipsy, a little blunted
I pulled up in the S-500
Fucked up, feeling all up on it

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
You know what I came to do, you
You know what I came to do
You know what I came to do, you
You know what I, oh
You know what I came to do, you
You know what I came to do
You know what I came to do, you
You know what I came to do
You know what I came to do, you
You know what I, for all my ladies
You know what I came to do, for them girls
For all my ladies, for all my ladies

[Verse 1: Chris Brown]
Baby you're so damn beautiful, and I, I really like it
I love your smile and the way that you move, yeah yeah
Baby, can I have a minute? Girl, I promise I won't waste your time
Cause I know you're kinda busy
Basically all I'm tryna say is you caught my eye
I know you need love, I'm tryna give it
And if you don't trust me, I'll show you, I'm a man of my word, girl
And if you're ready for the world I'll give it to ya, I'm so in love, like

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown]
It ain't nothing to make you want it
Get you tipsy, a little blunted
I pulled up in the S-500
Fucked up, feeling all up on it

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
You know what I came to do, you
You know what I came to do
You know what I came to do, you
You know what I, oh

[Verse 2: Akon]
To all my ladies, see I'll give you what you want
And he'll give you what you don't
I'm the man of the year, he just the man of the month
A hundred stacks in the trunk, he gon' do it
She got a hundred packs in the dump, he won't do it
And she type to fuck with real niggas
Yeah, and I'm the type that you want, and you knew it
See I'm just out to getting money while these niggas need a loan
Why you fucking with these dummies? We need to be alone
Cause I'm wanting you, baby, so what it do?
Cause I wanna change your life, me and you

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
You know what I came to do, you
You know what I came to do
You know what I came to do, you

You know what I came to do
Yeah, this for all my ladies, for all my ladies
