[Intro]

[Verse 1: Miwa Yoshida & (Akon)]
We lay like lovers in a warm embrace (Lovers in a warm embrace!)
Your kisses thrill me like no one before (Eh!)
Baby, I'm all yours, (Uh huh!) living just for you (Uh huh!)
(Uh huh!) (Yeah!)

[Verse 2: Miwa Yoshida & (Akon)]
I can see the moonlight shining through the mist (Shining through the mist!)
The moonbeams playing over you and me (Eh!)
I see the light of love (Uh huh!) shining in your eyes (Uh huh!)
(Uh huh!) (Wee!)

[Pre-Chorus: Miwa Yoshida, Masato Nakamura & (Akon)]
I'm holding you in my arms (Love you!)
Loving you beneath the stars
I don't want the night to steal you away
(Steal you away)

[Chorus: Dreams Come True & Akon]
Hold me close, I want you so
Don't you know that, baby?
Your love has touched my very soul
Can you feel it, baby?

Oh, Never let me go, darling
'Cause we're so in love
And we can dream on
Sweet dream

[Interlude]

[Verse 3: Miwa Yoshida, Masato Nakamura & (Akon)]
Your shadow captured in the silent night (In the silent night!)
I feel your breath, it whispers like a breeze (Eh!)
Oh baby, please be mine (Uh huh!) till the end of time (Uh huh!)
(Uh huh!) (Yeah!)

[Pre-Chorus: Miwa Yoshida, Masato Nakamura & (Akon)]
I'm holding you in my arms (Hold you in my arms!)
(Love you!) Loving you beneath the stars (beneath the stars, yeah!)
I don't want the night to steal you away
(Steal you away, steal you away!)

[Chorus: Dreams Come True & Akon]
Hold me close, I want you so
Don't you know that, baby?
Your love has touched my very soul
Can you feel it, baby?

Oh, Never let me go, darling
'Cause we're so in love
And we can dream on
Sweet dream
