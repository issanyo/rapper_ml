[Verse 1]
Two in the morning, girl you wake me up
Yelling "Some girl is calling" and I just got caught up
Cause you was going through my phone
And saw something you're not supposed to see
Baby girl you are so wrong and that shows you never trusted me

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm guilty of one half, you're guilty of the other
So baby we both have to answer to each other

[Chorus]
Stop going through my phone
You're the only one I call on
Stop going through my phone
You ask why I'm tripping like you ain't got no secrets
Stop going through my shit

[Verse 2]
Baby now you're telling me to leave you alone
When I'm there I'm yours baby
I can't control what they say through my phone
Girl tell me why you're looking for something
If you search hard enough you gon' find it
It's fucked up, I ain't done nothing
Baby you're so wrong
You're so wrong

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm guilty of one half, you're guilty of the other
So baby we both have to answer to each other

[Chorus]
Stop going through my phone
You're the only one I call on
Stop going through my phone
You ask why I'm tripping like you ain't got no secrets
Stop going through my shit
