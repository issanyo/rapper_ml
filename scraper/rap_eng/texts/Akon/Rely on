[Verse 1: Akon]
If your eyes could speak, they would tell me
What you see when you lookin' at me
And if your hands can talk, they would tell me
What you feel when you touchin' on me
And if your feet can see, they would show me
How far you've gone just to kick it with me
And these are tall tell signs that shows that you are mine
It's how your body translates to me

[Hook: Akon]
I wanna be the one that you can rely on
I wanna be the one that you can rely on
And give you everything, give you everything
You need to set you free
And give you everything, give you everything
You need to set you free

[Verse 2: Akon]
Cause if you didn't want me, you would tell me
Face to face that I'm not just your type
And if you didn't love me, you would tell me
To pack my bags and get out of your life
But instead she told me, not to worry
I'm the one man worth her sacrifice
And these are tall tell signs that shows that you are mine
It's how your body translates to me

[Hook: Akon]
I wanna be the one that you can rely on(can rely on me girl)
I wanna be the one that you can rely on(you can rely on me girl)
And give you everything, give you everything
You need to set you free
And give you everything, give you everything
You need to set you free

[Verse 3: Akon]
Cause I wanna be there, when you lonely and stressed
Wanna be there, when your car goes bad
Wanna be there, just to show you I care for you
You know I care for you
Cause I wanna be there, when you lonely and stressed
Wanna be there, when your car goes bad
Wanna be there, just to show you I care for you

[Hook: Akon]
I wanna be the one that you can rely on(rely on me babe)
I wanna be the one that you can rely on(you can rely on me babe)
And give you everything, give you everything
You need to set you free
And give you everything, give you everything
You need to set you free
