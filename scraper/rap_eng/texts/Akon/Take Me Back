Uuuuh... Baby yeah... ladadada

Take me back to the place where we were free
Didn't have a care in the world you see
All that raely matter was you and me

Times were still the world was frozen
A pretty pictured love was
Best friends and Lovers till eternity
You and me

But now the seasons chainging
Everythings will rearange and
Now your Kisses seem so cold
To visit your door
The Things we used to
It ain't the same anymore

Take me back (ooh)
Take me back to where it was good (ooh)
Take me back to where I was new (ooohoo)
Take me back (ooh)
'Cause I know things haven't been the way that they should (ooh)
But I know if you try than Baby you could (ooohoo)
Take me back

Let's troughlive this special moments
The moments that we took for granted
They way you helt my face in your hands (ohoo)
Caught in amazing love so true
Never thought that I loose you
Baby what I might do (dooo)

But now the seasons chainging
Everythings will rearange and
Now your touches seem so cold
To visit your door
The Things we used to
It ain't the same anymore

Take me back (ooh)
Take me back to where it was good (ooh)
Take me back to where I was new (ooohoo)
Take me back (ooh)
'Cause I know things haven't been the way that they should (ooh)
But I know if you try than Baby you could (ooohoo)
Take me back (Take me back)

Baby we can't dinigh
What we had it was right for so long
(Where d we go wrong)
So let's try to replay all these magical days
'Cause we've been trough the grey cancel the stormclouds away

Take me back (ooh)
Take me back to where it was good (ooh)
Take me back to where I was new (ooohoo)
Take me back (ooh)
'Cause I know things haven't been the way that they should (ooh)
But I know if you try than Baby you could (ooohoo)
Take me back (Take me back Baby)
