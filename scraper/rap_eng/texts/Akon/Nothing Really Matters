[Verse 1]
When she's ok
Then I'm alright
When she's awake
I'm up all night
And nothing really matters
Nothing really matters

[Verse 2]
I see her face
And in my mind
I seize the day
Whenever she's nearby
It's like nothing really matters, no
Nothing really matters

[Pre-Chorus]
She completes me
It's how she reads me
Right or wrong
It's so clear she's
All that I need
All I need yeah

[Chorus]
I know what it feels like
I know what it feels like
Swimming through the stars when I see her
And I don't need air because I breathe her
I know what it feels like
I know what it feels like yeah
I breathe her
Breathe her
Every time I see her
Every time I see her

[Verse 3]
When I'm lost
And need a sign
She leads the way
And I'll be fine
And nothing really matters
Nothing really matters

[Pre-Chorus]
She completes me
It's how she reads me
Right or wrong
It's so clear she's
All that I need
All I need yeah

[Chorus]
I know what it feels like
I know what it feels like
Swimming through the stars when I see her
And I don't need air because I breathe her
I know what it feels like
I know what it feels like yeah
I breathe her
Breathe her
Every time I see her
Every time I see her
Every time I see her
Every time I see her

[Verse 1]
When she's ok
Then I'm alright
When she's awake
I'm up all night
And nothing really matters
Nothing really matters
