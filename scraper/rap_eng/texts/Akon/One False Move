[Intro: C-Murder]
I'm C-Murder, and I'm back
Respect my mind
One false move, they tryna do your boy some dirty, ya heard me?
But it ain't gon' work, man
(?) CP3, Tru Records
That's how we rockin', homie

[Hook: Akon]
See, everybody wanna fake and pretend
But me, I'm tired of goin' in and outta the pen
I'm done with disobeyin' the law
One false move and I'll be back in the yard
If I had a choice, I wouldn't do it again
I'll unload the clip and conversate with my friend
Now this thing shouldn't be that hard
I done lost my dog, now I'm fallin' apart

[Verse 1: C-Murder]
They got me caught up in a situation, hectic, got me crazy like glue
My homies dyin' for colors, but me, I'm ridin' for Tru
See I ain't sidin' with you, I'm always dodgin' the blue
I got two records on the rise, I'm only signin' my crew
Forever loyal, no lyin'
No broken links, come try
I'ma rep the CP3 until the day that I die
Daddy threw it at me, but then I threw it right back
Tried to hit me with that curve, but I'ma fool with that bat
Now how you like me now, I'm gettin' bigger and richer
A third world villain, come here shorty, take a picture
Still thuggin' in the streets all day, just a lil bit
You see them cutboys loadin', now that's a real click
Straight goons with some change, bust brains, maintain
I'm the same lame with something to gain
So I pray for 'em tryna cross, cause I'm the boss
Papi's moves was false, now he lost, the street's cost

[Hook: Akon]
See, everybody wanna fake and pretend
But me, I'm tired of goin' in and outta the pen
I'm done with disobeyin' the law
One false move and I'll be back in the yard
If I had a choice, I wouldn't do it again
I'll unload the clip and conversate with my friend
Now this thing shouldn't be that hard
I done lost my dog, now I'm fallin' apart

[Verse 2: C-Murder]
I'm havin' visions of a nightmare, every sucka's playin' me close
I'm on the cover of The Source, with america's most
So many memories of thuggin' and pushin' it to the limit
Didn't have it, I had to get it, them forces I'm comin' with it
Them wigs was gettin' splitted, I'm tatted up, ya dig me?
Task was tryna kill me, railroad and deal me
I had to make em feel me, no duckin' and hidin'
200 on the dash of the whip I was drivin'
I hit the studio, let the pain flow
Watch the grange dro, rock that chain low
Calio the same coat
Dirty G, Porch Boy rest in peace
I won't let them bustas bury me, mane, I'm a beast
Drinkin' 1 and 1's, 2 and 3's, and let my mind free
I'm against the wall, cause my enemies behind me
They wanna see me in the bin or the pine, B
I'm under the radar, homie, you'll never find C

[Hook: Akon]
See, everybody wanna fake and pretend
But me, I'm tired of goin' in and outta the pen
I'm done with disobeyin' the law
One false move and I'll be back in the yard
If I had a choice, I wouldn't do it again
I'll unload the clip and conversate with my friend
Now this thing shouldn't be that hard
I done lost my dog, now I'm fallin' apart

[Verse 3: C-Murder]
The streets keep calling me, mayne, I'm in the zone
50's and four-nickles, you trippin', hang up the phone
Who can I trust? I'm lookin' at friends whichever lies
They capitalize, tryna survive
They gettin' high, I'm getting by
I only hate you, if you hate me
Your mama made you a hater, but the streets made me
The game (?) makes me
For face to face, (?) case to take me
Ain't no way to break me
(?)
(?) I rap, I don't sing
Now welcome to my world, it's kinda grimey at the bottom
Only the strong survive, you poachers watch me dodge
Homie, I'm a rider, label me suicidal
Political refugee of war (?)
Assassinate my (?) you feel my arrival
Now check me,  wrong move, homie, it's my survival

[Hook: Akon]
See, everybody wanna fake and pretend
But me, I'm tired of goin' in and outta the pen
I'm done with disobeyin' the law
One false move and I'll be back in the yard
If I had a choice, I wouldn't do it again
I'll unload the clip and conversate with my friend
Now this thing shouldn't be that hard
I done lost my dog, now I'm fallin' apart
