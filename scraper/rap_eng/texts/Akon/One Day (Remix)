[Verse 1: Akon]
See, everybody that's existing got a mind of their own
We're all kings and queens with a throne of our own
Tryin' to raise our families in a healthy home
We got to learn to stick together, hate to be here alone
'Cause the world is a place
That will eat you alive in one day
Said the world is a place
That you can't survive without faith

[Pre-Chorus 1: Matisyahu]
Sometimes in my tears I drown
But I never let it get me down
So when negativity surrounds
I know some day it'll all turn around, because

[Chorus: Matisyahu]
All my life I've been waiting for
I've been praying for
For the people to say
That we don't wanna fight no more
They'll be no more wars
And our children will play

[Refrain: Matisyahu]
One day (one day), one day (one day), one day
One day (one day), one day (one day), one day

[Verse 2: Matisyahu]
It's not about win or lose
'Cause we all lose when they feed on the
Souls of the innocent
Blood-drenched pavement
Keep on moving, though the waters stay raging
In this maze, you can lose your way (your way)
It might drive you crazy
But don't let it faze you, no way (no way)

[Pre-Chorus 2: Akon]
Gotta hold on (one day, one day)
And live your life day by day
Gotta hold on (one day, one day)
Put your focus on that one day

[Chorus: Matisyahu]
All my life I've been waiting for (waiting for)
I've been praying for (praying for)
For the people to say
That we don't wanna fight no more (fight no more)
They'll be no more wars (no more wars)
And our children will play

[Refrain: Matisyahu]
One day (one day), one day (one day), one day
One day (one day), one day (one day), one day

[Bridge: Matisyahu + Akon]
One day this all will change, treat people the same
Stop with the violence, down with the hate
One day we'll all be free and proud to be
Under the same sun, singing songs of freedom like
Gotta hold on one day, one day
And live your life day by day
Gotta hold on one day, one day
Put your focus on that one day

[Chorus: Matisyahu]
All my life I've been waiting for (waiting for)
I've been praying for (praying for)
For the people to say
That we don't wanna fight no more (fight no more)
They'll be no more wars (no more wars)
And our children will play

[Refrain: Matisyahu + Akon]
One day (one day), one day (one day), one day
One day, one day
One day (one day), one day (one day), one day
One day, one day
