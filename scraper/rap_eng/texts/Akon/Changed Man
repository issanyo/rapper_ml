[Intro: Nino Bless]
Heh, dim the lights down real quick tryin to get in my zone, Nino, see anybody can make the wrong choice, mistake, but a real man it'll make him a better individual, Akon

[Hook: Akon]
Mama hold her head and cry because I was shot down on the streets and died, that was just a dream but I took it as a sign to rethink my life

[Verse 1: Nino Bless]
All this sh*t I done it I passed and blamed it on my mother or dad, blamed it on the gutter all the trouble I had, stuck on the ave, no soul lookin for sumthin to grab, I probobily get a gun and blast just for a hundred in cash, the lack of a budget or sallary, had me with a f**kin mentality sh*t is sad but a F**ked up reality, look for everytime I mistreated my mom I reached to god till I bleed for my palms, but dont recive a response maby I should be the quran, maby I should leave it alone who knows but I preach to the corner I speak for my people in hunger, so I can't leave the streets and diss on them, I gotta keep on it, beach em cause I beat wit it beat from where they breath from with week lungs and eat crums these slumbs and im teachin each one with each rhyme, not a reason to speak of u see how.chea

[Hook: Akon]
O! im a changed man, for the evil things ive done to them just let me live my life again, and I apoligise today, im a changed man, a changed man" for the way that I treated within just let me live my life again and I apoligize today ima changed man

[Verse 2: Nino Bless]
Late night in the ghetto papa wasent there hed pop up in my ear but I just nevenr care cause I was over here blaming god he and the coldest air raining shot cause he ignored a prayre, I hoped a fence in a popular sence they thought id probibly be locked and boxed in the pen, sippin vodka gettin bent one day I gripped a pen, I knew I could repent when a vand marker was a pent, the cheddeer I blamd I urned for the cash but a much better man would learn from his past, but the pain won't go away I know a stage and it weigs, the strips heavey on my shoulder blades, on those days I sit back and im so amazed my life changed but try thing and striped cane my right pain, so my aim though I got condo pop song im in top form just hearing my block form

[Hook: Akon]
O! im a changed man, for the evil things ive done to them just let me live my life again, and I apoligise today, im a changed man, a cahnged man" for the way that I treated within just let me live my life again and I apoligize today ima changed man

[Bridge: Akon]
The streets are watching well then the clouds are listning then everything in between must be death and blind cause were still not listning, then the streets are watching well then the clouds are listning then everything in between must be death and blind cause were still not listening

[Hook: Akon]
