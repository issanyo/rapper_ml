[Verse 1]
Yes, I can see her
Cause every girl here want to be her
Oh she's a diva
I feel the same and I want to meet her
They say she low down
It's just a rumor and I don't believe 'em
They say she needs to slow down
The baddest thing around town

[Chorus]
She's nothing like the girls you've ever seen before
Nothing you can compare to your neighborhood, hood
I'm trying to find the words to describe this girl without being disrespectful
The way that booty moving, I can't take no more
Had to stop what I'm doing so I can pull her close
I'm trying to find the words to describe this girl without being disrespectful

[Hook]
Damn girl!
Damn you'se a sexy chick
A sexy chick
Damn you'se a sexy chick
Damn girl!
Damn you'se a sexy chick
A sexy chick
Damn you'se a sexy chick
Damn girl!

[Verse 2]
Yes, I can see her
Cause every girl here want to be her
Oh she's a diva
I feel the same and I want to meet her
They say she low down
It's just a rumor and I don't believe 'em
They say she needs to slow down
The baddest thing around town

[Chorus]
She's nothing like the girls you've ever seen before
Nothing you can compare to your neighborhood, hood
I'm trying to find the words to describe this girl without being disrespectful
The way that booty moving, I can't take no more
Had to stop what I'm doing so I can pull her close
I'm trying to find the words to describe this girl without being disrespectful

[Hook]
Damn girl!
Damn you'se a sexy chick
A sexy chick
Damn you'se a sexy chick
Damn girl!
Damn you'se a sexy chick
A sexy chick
Damn you'se a sexy chick
Damn girl!
