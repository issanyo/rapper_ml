[Hook]
Wish I could keep you much longer
I know you gotta go cause you got things to do
Wish I could keep you much longer
Now you too busy for me girl, like I was to you

[Post-Hook]
Wish I could stop by and maybe say "hi"
Wish I could just stop by and lay by your side
Wish I could just stop by and maybe say "hi"
Wish I could just stop by and lay by your side

[Verse 1]
The tables have turned
And I've finally learned
That this is making up for every day I was gone
And that's why I'm concerned
But now it's confirmed
That you spread your wings and learned to fly but all alone

[Pre-Hook]
Darkness in the night, I'll find that light for you
As long as I got eyes, I'll have a sight for you
Long as I'm alive baby, I'd die for you, wanna be with you

[Hook]
Wish I could keep you much longer
I know you gotta go 'cause you got things to do
Wish I could keep you much longer
Now you too busy for me girl, like I was to you

[Post-Hook]
Wish I could stop by and maybe say "Hi"
Wish I could just stop by and lay by your side
Wish I could just stop by and maybe say "Hi"
Wish I could just stop by and lay by your side

[Verse 2]
You're always on my mind, while I'm racin'
While I'm paper chasin'
You were there when I said one day I'd get up out that basement
Playin' as my agent
For you there's no replacement
You will always be my girl, you can hold me on that statement

[Pre-Hook]
Darkness in the night, I'll find that light for you
As long as I got eyes, I'll have a sight for you
Long as I'm alive, baby, I'd die for you, wanna be with you

[Hook]
Wish I could keep you much longer
I know you gotta go 'cause you got things to do
Wish I could keep you much longer
Now you too busy for me girl, like I was to you

[Post-Hook]
Wish I could stop by and maybe say "Hi"
Wish I could just stop by and lay by your side
Wish I could just stop by and maybe say "Hi"
Wish I could just stop by and lay by your side

[Bridge: Akon]
Baby, I know you and how we do
Doing exactly what I taught you
Gotta get that money first before you
Come spend that precious time with your boo
And know I gotta just take it
Even though it's drivin' me crazy
Always want to see my girl make it (ooh, yeah)

[Hook]
Wish I could keep you much longer
I know you gotta go 'cause you got things to do
Wish I could keep you much longer (I wish, I wish I could keep you so much longer)
Now you too busy for me girl, like I was to you

[Post-Hook]
Wish I could stop by and maybe say "Hi"
Wish I could just stop by and lay by your side
Wish I could just stop by and maybe say "Hi"
Wish I could just stop by and lay by your side

[Hook]
Wish I could keep you much longer (Wish I could keep you, baby)
I know you gotta go 'cause you got things to do
Wish I could keep you much longer (Wish I could keep you, baby)
Now you too busy for me girl, like I was to you

[Post-Hook]
Wish I could stop by and maybe say "Hi" (I just wanna keep you longer...)
Wish I could just stop by and lay by your side
Wish I could just stop by and maybe say "Hi" (I just wanna keep you longer...)
Wish I could just stop by and lay by your side

[Outro]
I just wanna keep you longer...
I just wanna keep you longer...
