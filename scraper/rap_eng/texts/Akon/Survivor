We'll do this don't stop
All the seed is like a fire, like a fire
Show no sympathy
I'll be way upon the mountain
Lying down for me
'Cause I am a survivor, survivor
I'm a survivor
'Cause I am a survivor, survivor
I'm a survivor
When my hand lifts up for me
Not to mean the flair
Got them always darkle flame me
Higher like flair
Momma know that I will leave
'Cause that's what I provided
Every day I get raised
And live by the sun
All the seeds like a fire like a fire
Show no sympathy
I'll be way upon the mountain
Lying down for me
'Cause I am a survivor, survivor
I'm a survivor
'Cause I am a survivor, survivor
I'm a survivor
Seems there is no sympathy
Or no mercy for the wind
What surrender all retreat
I'll make you remember me
And for those who want to kill me
Know exactly where to find me
Down in a concrete jungle
Like I don't care like I ever pleased
Don't tell me
I hunted miles and running
Never bad gun on a hard blood coming
I'll tell her relook stunning
'Cause I am a survivor, survivor
I'm a survivor
'Cause I am a survivor, survivor
I'm a survivor
I am so high upon the mountain
Can't find the way but don't
Watch me flow the step of fountain
Sadly does a girl
I'll the loft to kill me
Then let me kills evils
'Cause I'm a junker I'm a hero
'Cause I am a survivor, survivor
I'm a survivor
'Cause I am a survivor, survivor
I'm a survivor
