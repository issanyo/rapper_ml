Ay this one right here goes to all the shawty's in the world that need a real man in their life

Oooo, damn girl your on fire
Oooo, damn girl your on fire

All the beautiful girls in the world
(From the A-town to the south of France)
Feeling they ain't getting enough of love
(And you're sick of what you're dealing with)

If I had you here you know what I'd give you. Ooo, the next time he hurt you bad baby
Let me make it all ok

(Out the hood with no fear)
Don't wanna have to pull my gun
(But if I have to I will)
For two days straight I'm a keep you up
(Make you feel like you ain't felt)
In my bed hitting it like he didn't hit it bad

(I know you on fire) And your man don't F*** you right
Damn, my side is cold just come on in
(I know you about it) You gon' get your chance to show tonight
Stress no more, just come on in. [x2]

It must be hard to spend every night and. (Getting no love)
Only affection that you getting is when he

Everything will be ok

See I know your getting out of control. (Out of control)
Cause the one your dealing with is really getting old. (So getting old)
Know I got that brand new
Do more than your man do
Go on and go grab some chocolate before the market close
Show 'em you lady. (Hey)
Show 'em you my baby. (Hey)
Now raise your hands up
Oh, I forgot that ring too heavy. (Hey)
Man I had to get it. (Hey)
And rock you steady. (Hey)
Had to keep my baby close to my hip like a machete
(I wouldn't be here) I wouldn't be here for you if I didn't care
Wanna do what I do with you shawty and pull your hair
Is that too rough? (When the going gets tough)
Put you in handcuffs. (Can you go right there) Gotta change, you'll never be nowhere but in my care

First I'm a come and get you girl
(Out the hood with no fear)
Don't wanna have to pull my gun
(But if I have to I will)
For two days straight I'm a keep you up
(Make you feel like you ain't felt)
In my bed hitting it like he didn't do it bad

(I know you on fire) And your man don't F*** you right
Damn, my side is cold just come on in
