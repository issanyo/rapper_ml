[Hook: Akon]
That girl ain't no joke
I love the way she roll
Especially when she working going up and down that pole
Cos she's a professional and she'll stick you up without a weapon, oh she's so cold
If you don't know she'll rob you for your silver and gold (gold, gold..)
She will take it and go (go, go..)
For your silver and gold (gold, gold..)
She will take it and go(go,go..)
If you don't know..
Yeah

[Verse 1: Sway]
Just hopped off a plane
Name just popped up again
UK just got hot again
Konvict music, top for the game
I'm in the club and I'm watching the dame
Who's in love 'cos shes watching the watching the chain
And where there is drop over range
One thing is for sure
It's the top of the range
Clubs about to close
Follow me to my crib, come without your clothes
Most girls are happy with a rose
She rather have bottles of rose hennessy and more
She's out for the dough
She'll bounce for anyone with an account full of 0’s
Got bounced from anyone when her account gets low
'Cos money money money makes the girls get low

[Hook: Akon]


[Verse 2: Sway]
Yeah I'm on the beat, got the whole club feeling like Rio on the beach
She got them pretty Louis V upon her feet
And she loves me 'cos im a CEO of my team
And she could tell where you came
Running with Akon but I ain't T-Pain
Get a little change, but I exchange pounds
Make it thunder in the club, who da hell needs rain
Baby love glamour she ain't never been played
She loves London but she ain't never been Spain
She's always telling me how much she loves my accent
But she's thinkin to herself, what the hell is he saying
Yeah she's out for the dough
She'll bounce for anyone with an account full of 0’s
Got bounced from anyone when her account gets low
Cuz money money money makes the girls get low

[Hook: Akon]


[Bridge: Akon]
If you never been exposed
You better be..
Ready for this type of woman
Cuz shes outta your league
I watched her make the most powerful men just crawl on their knees
Beggin for mercy..
