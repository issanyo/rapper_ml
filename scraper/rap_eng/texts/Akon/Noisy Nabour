My binoculars on, alone
Staring out of my window
I see the best creation of
Woman that I ever saw in
A long, long time

Some say it is wrong
But what if she knows
That I am spying on her
Would she strip down
Naked and entertain me

Oh my God she's doing it

Taking it of (x5)

She's getting naked (x4)

She threw her shirt
(Off on the floor)
Then threw her bra
(Off on the floor)
Then threw her skirt
(Off on the floor)
Then threw her drawers
(Off on the floor)

(I can't believe )
(She's getting naked)
(X4)
I'm wanting her, off on the floor
On top of her, off on the floor
No stopping her, off on the floor

She knows I'm watching her, off on the floor...

(I can't believe)
(She's getting naked)
(X4)

TAKING IT OFF!
