I'm steady tryna find a motive
Why I do what I do?
Freedom ain't gettin' no closer
No matter how far I go

My car is stolen
No registration
Cops patrolin'
And now they don't stop me and I get locked up

They won't let me out, they won't let me out
They won't let me out no, they won't let me out
They won't let me out, they won't let me out
They won't let me out no, they won't let me out

Headin' uptown to re-up
Back with a couple keys
Corner blocks on fire
Under covers dressed as fiends

Makin' so much money
Ride up smooth and fast
Put away the stash
And as I sold the last bag fucked around and got locked up

They won't let me out, they won't let me out
They won't let me out no, they won't let me out
They won't let me out, they won't let me out
They won't let me out no, they won't let me out

'Cuz visitation no longer comes by
Seems like they forgot about me
Commissary is getting empty

My cell mates getting food without me
Can't wait to get out and move forward with my life
Got a family that loves me and wants me to do right
But instead I'm here locked up

They won't let me out, they won't let me out
They won't let me out no, they won't let me out
They won't let me out, they won't let me out
They won't let me out no, they won't let me out

Maybe a visit
Send me some magazines
Send me some money orders

Maybe a visit baby
'Cuz I'm locked up
Where's my lawyer?

I'm locked up
Get me out of here
I'm locked up

Baby, I'm locked up
Where's my niggas, on the lock-down?
Damn, I'm locked up

I'm locked up
Oh
Can you please accept my phone calls?
'Cuz I'm locked up, locked up, locked up
