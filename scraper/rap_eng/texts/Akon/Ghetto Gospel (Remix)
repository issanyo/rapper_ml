If I could recollect before my hood days
I'd sit and reminisce, nigga and bliss on the good days
I stop and stare at the younger, my heart goes to 'em
They tested, it was stressed that they under
We never really went threw that coz we was born B.C u n me b4 crack
In our days, things changed
Everyone's ashamed to the youth 'cause the truth looks strange
And for me it's reversed, we left them a world that's cursed, and it hurts
Cause any day they'll push the button
And y'all condemned like Malcolm x and Bobby Hunton, died for nothin
Don't them let me get teary, the world looks dreary
But when you wipe your eyes, see it clearly
There's no need for you to fear me
If you take the time to hear me, maybe you can learn to cheer me
It ain't about black or white, 'cause we're human
I hope we see the light before its ruined
My ghetto gospel

Whoever said that this struggle would stop today
A lot of niggas dead or locked away
Teenage Women growing up with aids
Cause that's the life when your
Living in the (ghetto)
Or eating in the (ghetto)
Or sleeping in the (ghetto, ghetto)
That's the life when your
Living in the (ghetto)
Or eating in the (ghetto)
Or sleeping in the (ghetto, ghetto, ghetto)

Tell me do you see that old lady ain't it sad
Living out a bag, but she's glad for the little things she has
And over there there's a lady, crack got her crazy
Guess she's given birth to a baby
I don't trip and let it fade me, from outta the frying pan
We jump into another form of slavery
Even now I keep discouraged
Wonder if they take it all back while I still keep the courage
I refuse to be a role model
I set goals, take control, drink out my own bottle
I make mistakes, I learn from everyone
And when its said and done
I bet this brotha be a better one
If I'm upset, you don't stress
Never forget, that God hasn't finished with me yet
I feel his hand on my brain
When I write rhymes, I go blind, and let the lord do his thang
But am I less holy
'cause I choose to puff a blunt and drink a beer with my homies
Before we find world peace
We gotta find peace in that war on the streets
My ghetto gospel
