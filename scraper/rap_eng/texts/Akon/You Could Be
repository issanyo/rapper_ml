[Verse 1]
See I met her at club on the Friday
Big booty, small waist
Seeing her coming my way
So I had to bag her
I really had to have her (oh-ooh)
I didn't see a ring on her finger
I asked her have you ever been with a singer before
She said no (oh-ohh)
So let me introduce you to my world
Big diamonds and pearls all of part of being my girl
(I got that piper)
Bet you ain't never seen before
Saw around the world
I got them coming back for more

[Chorus]
And thats when I noticed
People are watching!
But we dont care
The way I am touching your body
Cuz we dont care
See you droppin and poppin
But we dont care
Makes me want to keep grinding
But we dont care (oh-ooh)
See I bet youre nasty
When youre on the dance floor
You got me going: Oh-Oooh!
Could you be the reason why Im losing control
Fo Sho! Shawty we don't care!

[Verse 2]
Got shorty right where I want her
Strapped up, hands trapped in the corner
Grinding slow, and I won't let go (no-ooh)
Baby more better than ammonia
Feeling tipsy from the bottle of Corona (oh-noo)
She probably let go (oh-ooh)
She said she wants to bring me to bring me to her world
She whispers some words
That damn near made my toes curl
She said shes got that
That I have never seen before
And if I get the taste
Ill be coming right back for more

[Chorus]
And thats when I noticed
People are watching!
But we dont care
The way I am touching your body
Cuz we dont care
See you droppin and poppin
But we dont care
Makes me want to keep grinding
But we dont care (oh-ooh)
See I bet youre nasty
When youre on the dance floor
You got me going: Oh-Oooh!
Could you be the reason why Im losing control
Fo Sho! Shawty we don't care!

[Verse 3]
Im working your body
Like you are in my bedroom
YeahYeaUh-uhhYeahYeah
Everybody in the club got a clear view

[Chorus]
But that won't stop us
Cuz we dont care!
People are watching!
We dont care
The way I am touching your body
Cuz we dont care
See you droppin and poppin
But we dont care
Makes me want to keep grinding
But we dont care (oh-ooh)
See I bet youre nasty
When youre on the dance floor
You got me going: Oh-Oooh!
Could you be the reason why Im losing control
Fo Sho! Shawty we don't care!
