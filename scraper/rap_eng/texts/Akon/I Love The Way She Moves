I love the way she moves
I see the way she's coming
I wanna rock her body
I know she's waiting for me (x2)

(Zion)
She's like shakira belly dancing on the grammy awards
Like beyonce clappin her booty on the MTV show
She so amazing, She drives me crazy
Baila baila mamita que te quiero ver
Rompiendo la pista abusadura
Eres bien tentadora
De toda la mas seductora
Baila baila mamita que te quiero ver
Rompiendo la pista abusadura
Eres bien tentadora
De toda la mas seductora

For me itÂ´s so tempting that i can't deny
For us to be together side by side
La noche esta buena para experimentar
Just me and you together sin parar

The way her body jiggling all in her attire
Dropping in down low while she bring it up higher
While we singing our

(Akon)
Shorty so sexy i wanna take you to my crib
Excuse me kon let me help you out she don't speak no english
Ella se ve de lo mas bien quiero sacarte de aqui
Por si no lo sabias esta noche your gonna end up with me
Then i can describe you, You know slip and slide you
Flip you over good loving is what i can provide you
If you don't want it then walk away cause its your right to
But i wanna show you to the world never hide you
Cause your the most beatifullest thing i've ever seen
And you get the potential to blow me up like gasoline
And am trying to be pacient trying to be a gentleman
Can't you see what you doing to me

I wanna rock her body (rock you body right now)
I know she's waiting for me(x2)
