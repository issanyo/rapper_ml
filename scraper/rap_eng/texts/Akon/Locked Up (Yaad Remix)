[Intro: Vybz Kartel]
Prison life never, never, never nice
Prison life anuh nothing like paradise
Prison life, man will take your life
And when you rest in peace, another man a f- your wife
Prison life never, never, never nice
Prison life anuh nothing like paradise
Prison life, man will take your life
You know it's Kartel, the Jamaican
Akon!

[Verse 1: Akon & Vybz Kartel]
I'm steady tryin' to find the motive
Why I do what I do? (Why?!)
Freedom ain't getting no closer
No matter how far I go
My car is stolen, no registration
Cops patrolin' and now they done stop me
And I get locked up

[Hook: Akon & Vybz Kartel]
They won't let me out (Let me out nuh)
They won't let me out, (Hey! Let me out!)
I'm locked up...
They won't let me out (Let me out nuh)
No, they won't let me out (Let me out)
I'm locked up...
They won't let me out (Let me out nuh)
They won't let me out (Let me out nuh)
I'm locked up...
They won't let me out (Let me out nuh)
No, they won't let me out (Hey!)

[Verse 2: Vybz Kartel]
When Shotta go a jail
Me no empty no shit pail
Grill fly, me no peep through rail
Me have weed for sale
Mi lawyer a big Queen's Counsel, so me never worry 'bout bail
When Shotta go a jail
Ward a send in fi him mail
High grade, inhale and exhale
Me no nyam prison food, a steam fish and lobster tail
Hennessy bore mi head like nail
Dem can't beat me! Like wha' dem do Arthur Wale
Me have a judge woman a Meadowvale...and one a Greendale
The bwoy weh lock me up, when him see me him haffi hail
Blinga anuh gyal like Suzie Q weh deh pon Reggae Trail...
Fi crush like bread when it stale
When you go a prison, you go college bigger than UWI and Oxford, Harvard and Yale

[Verse 3: Akon]
Heading uptown to re-up
Back with a couple keys
Corner block's on fire
Undercovers dressed as fiends
Making so much money
Product's moving fast
Put away the stash
And as I sold the last bag
Fucked around and got locked up

[Hook: Akon & Vybz Kartel]
They won't let me out (Let me out nuh)
They won't let me out, (Hey! Let me out!)
I'm locked up...
They won't let me out (Let me out nuh)
No, they won't let me out (Let me out)
I'm locked up...
They won't let me out (Let me out nuh)
They won't let me out (Let me out)
I'm locked up...
They won't let me out (Let me out nuh)
No, they won't let me out (Hey!)

[Verse 3: Vybz Kartel]
Jail anuh daycare center, no Petcom no Creech
You can't wear brief, anuh beach
If you soap drop, that go, no care how you preach
Watch weh you walk barefeet
Bwoy, you hold your straight, beaten fi who don't -
Thugs and gays no locate
Jawbone mi dislocate!
Knife cut burn your skin like Neoprosone and Neo-Vate
Bwoy cyan take mi visits
Tell me him a Shotta, mi say, "Is it?"
Him have murder charge, me go quiz it
Find say the charge him deh pon was smaller than a midget
Knife stab, double digit
Madden fridge it
Prisoner support sure
Central Greater Portmore
One day you must walk through the door
Gyallis galore!
Zebra a' raper so lowe him but please free up Jah Cure!
Please?

[Verse 4: Akon]
â€˜Cause visitation no longer comes by
Seems like they forgot about me
Commissary is getting empty
My cellmates getting food without me
Can't wait to get out
And move forward with my life
Got a family that loves me
And wants me to do right
But instead I'm here locked up

[Hook: Akon & Vybz Kartel]
They won't let me out (Let me out nuh)
They won't let me out, (Hey! Let me out!)
I'm locked up...
They won't let me out (Let me out nuh)
No, they won't let me out (Let me out)
My nigga, I'm locked up...
They won't let me out (Let me out nuh)
They won't let me out (Let me out)
I'm locked up...
They won't let me out (Let me out nuh)
No, they won't let me out (Hey!)
I'm locked up...

[Outro: Vybz Kartel]
Prison life never, never, never nice
Prison life anuh nothing like paradise
Prison life, man will take your life
And when you rest in peace, another man a f- your wife
Prison life never, never, never nice...
