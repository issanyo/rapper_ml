[Verse 1]
What makes you want to live again
Goodbye my enemies, hello my friends
And what would make you forgive the man
Who was once your enemy but now your friend

The sunshine is waiting for me on the other side of the rainbow
The point of no return, my life's changing

For the better
The better (x4)

[Chorus]
Cause now I know better
So, thanks to my past
Oh, baby now it's all better
Let's make this shit last
Oh, yes, cause now I know better
So, thanks to my past
Oh, yes, I know there nothing better than now [?]

[Verse 2]
Hello pretenders, hello my friends
Hello to those who didn't want us to win
Hello backstabber and your cheap grin
There's more just like you that's listening

The sunshine is waiting for me on the other side of the rainbow
The point of no return, my life's changing

For the better
The better (x4)

[Chorus x2]
