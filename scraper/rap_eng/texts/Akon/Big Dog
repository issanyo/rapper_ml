Feeling like a big dog
Woof! Hey!
Feeling like a big dog
Woof! Hey!
Feeling like a big dog

Ever since I got bitten by my dog, things changed
Everything is different and my life is not the same
I must've been infected when he bit me on my hand
And now I understand why I'm feeling like a big dog

Feeling like a big dog

I can see a lot farther, I can hear a lot clearer
My senses getting better, transitions getting narrowed
I noticed that I'm chasing every cat that pass by
And I think I know why I'm feeling like a big dog

Feeling like a big dog

Now are you feeling like a big dog
Oh yeah
Said are you feeling like a big dog
Oh yeah
Come and shout it out, hey, out, hey, out, hey
Come and shout it out, hey, out, hey, out, hey

I can see a lot farther, I can hear a lot clearer
My senses getting better, transitions getting narrowed
I noticed that I'm chasing every cat that pass by
And I think I know why I'm feeling like a big dog

Feeling like a big dog
