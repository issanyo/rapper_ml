Mark AKON word for now (yeah Un Huh?)

As life goes on, I'm starting to learn
More and more about responsibility
And I realize that everything I do
Is affecting the people around me
So I want to take this time
To apologize to things I have done
And things that haven't Occurred yet
And things they don't want to take responsibility for

[Hook]
I'm sorry about the way I've been acting
You were serious, I was joking
I'm sorry about the way I've been making people laugh
You were serious, I was joking
I'm sorry for the wrong things that I've done
I really don't mean anything I said
You were serious I was joking
I'm sorry for the names that I call you
I'm sorry for the pain I left in you

Chasing my dreams with my hands and legs
