Keep slurring keep pourin' swerving out of control
Stevie Wonder's own eyes damn near closed
Rockin' 85, slidin' on them deuce four's
Fucka speed limit bitch I'm living life in slow mo
I'm living life in slow mo
Stevie Wonder's own eyes damn near closed
Rockin' 85, slidin' on them duece four's
Fucka speed limit bitch I'm living life in slow mo

Money J Verse 1:
Slow motion, I left my last girl heart broken
I'm just blowing gats with the doors open
Pop the seal on the lean, and start pourin'
Yeah my car old school but my bitch is foreign
This is the life of a young boss
On 85 getting head with my top off
50inch TV's in my Sprinter
Balling on these niggas Summer, spring and in the winter
Fuck with the team baby girl we're some winners
Fucking with them lanes whatcha see in them niggas
Got my Stevie Wonder's on I ain't seein' me niggas
Killing these rappers, R-A-P'n these niggas

[Chorus:]
Keep slurring keep pourin' swerving out of control
Stevie Wonder's own eyes damn near closed
Rockin' 85, slidin' on them duece four's
Fucka speed limit bitch I'm living life in slow mo
I'm living life in slow mo
Stevie Wonder's own eyes damn near closed
Rockin' 85, slidin' on them deuce four's
Fucka speed limit bitch I'm living life in slow mo

Akon Verse 1:
Moving slow in this McLaren so they all can see me
Nigga winnin' attitude, shit is so easy
I'm living life, I'm on top of mine
And there's nobody here on Earth could ever stop my grind
Say slow money, is better than making none at all
So I'm taking my time because I need it all
Paper chasing, getting money on another level
But still rocking with them goons and them fucking rebels
Ain't a movie a spril life, I really live it
If you heard me talk about it then I probably did it
Real talk slow down take your time homie
Go hard or go home when it's time homie

[Chorus:]
Keep slurring keep pourin' swerving out of control
Stevie Wonder's own eyes damn near closed
Rockin' 85, slidin' on them duece four's
Fucka speed limit bitch I'm living life in slow mo
(Slow Motion)
I'm living life in slow mo
Stevie Wonder's own eyes damn near closed
Rockin' native, slidin' on them duece four's
Fucka speed limit bitch I'm living life in slow mo

Money J verse 2:
Slow motion, fuck the speed limit slow mo
I like a light skin bitch 5-4
Got my true religions on with the bank roll
Got your girl legs up like a feel go
Fo'Real doe, I get dough
That 72 Chevelle made me feel old
These hoes say I'm concieted
In my ever bullshit and i don't even need it
Catch me on the east of Atlanta with a 2 liter sprites, some zan's and jolly ranchers
All black car like the fucking black panthers
I smoke so many poes that I might catch cancer

[Chorus:]
Keep slurring keep pourin' swerving out of control
Stevie Wonder's own eyes damn near closed
Rockin' 85, slidin' on them duece four's
Fucka speed limit bitch I'm living life in slow mo
(Slow Motion)
I'm living life in a slow mo
Stevie Wonder's own eyes damn near closed
Rockin' 85, slidin' on them duece four's
Fucka speed limit bitch I'm living life in slow mo
Slow Motion
Slow Motion
Slow Motion
