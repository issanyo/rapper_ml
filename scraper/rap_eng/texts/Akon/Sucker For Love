I'm not a sucker for love
X4 hahahaha yea

We're fussin' and fightin'
All day and nights end
Wondering if we ever change
Sittin' here thinking'
For one damn reason
Why you wanna push it away

I swear that I know you know
I never knew you
The shit that we've been through is not
The only thing that broke me down
Girl you should know by now
I should've never put my trust in you

So listen to me girl
Cause this is how it goes
You play me for a fool
I've been down that road before
Cause I ain't even trying to go back to be giving everything
Cause ain't nothing better than reconsidering the pain
Now your heart is bleeding tears
They're falling down your face
Said to get a grip cause you can always be replaced
Cause I ain't even trying to go back to giving you my all
Cause ain't nothing better than reconsidering the fall

I'm not a sucker for love
You can be my homie be my lover
Girl I put that on everything
I'm not a sucker for love (no)
Even though I wine you and dine you
And always keep you entertained
I'm not a sucker for love
Don't take my kindness for weakness
And then expect me to treat you the same
I'm not a sucker for love (no)
I'll drop you off on the turnpike
Then continue switching lanes

Cause I'm over you
Uh-huh
Over you
Uh-huh
Over you girl
I'm not a sucker for love (no)
X4
(cause I'm)

If there's a moment in truth in a relationship
You getting close to it
Girl I ain't trying to hear it
Don't try to explain
I give you everything
You're throwing it away
Hey hey girl
Now your telling you need a minute or two
To think about those 4 letters you said to me
Your pushing me to the ledge
Hangin over the edge
And I'm about to let it go

So listen to me girl
Cause this is how it goes
You play me for a fool
I've been down that road before
Cause I ain't even trying to go back to be giving everything
Cause ain't nothing better than reconsidering the pain
Now your heart is bleeding tears
They're falling down your face
Said to get a grip cause you can always be replaced
Cause I ain't even trying to go back to giving you my all
Cause ain't nothing better than reconsidering the fall

I'm not a sucker for love
You can be my homie be my lover
Girl I put that on everything
I'm not a sucker for love (no)
Even though I wine you and dine you
And always keep you entertained
I'm not a sucker for love
Don't take my kindness for weakness
And then expect me to treat you the same
I'm not a sucker for love (no)
I'll drop you off on the turnpike
Then continue switching lanes

Cause I'm over you
Uh-huh
Over you
Uh-huh

I'm not a sucker for love (no)

Oh let it breathe
Take it like amphetamines
Try to lead try to dream
See it as possibilities
Be real with me
Even with my ego you deal with me
See we close the deal you see
From pico to melanie
Giving you everything
Everything that you see
Necklace no diamonds
Watches no time and
Grinding
I'm a show you California's finest
If you trip then you letting out that demon
Going and buyin in

I'm not a sucker for love
You can be my homie be my lover
Girl I put that on everything
I'm not a sucker for love (no)
Even though I wine you and dine you
And always keep you entertained
I'm not a sucker for love
Don't take my kindness for weakness
And then expect me to treat you the same
I'm not a sucker for love (no)
(cause no one loves you like love you)
I'll drop you off on the turnpike
Then continue switching lanes

Cause I'm over you
Uh-huh
Over you
Uh-huh
Over you girl
I'm not a sucker for love (no)
