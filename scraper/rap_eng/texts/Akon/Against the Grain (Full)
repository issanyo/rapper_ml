Konvict, Konvict, Konvict

So soft and slow, never knew a girl
Could be so god damn cold
I know, the way she move
Got me spendin' my dough
And yo, if you would've seen
What I seen on the pole, just know

That I was wrong for fallin' in love
I was wrong for fallin' in love
(They always say don't love a ho)
I was wrong for fallin' in love
(Don't do it, yo)
I was wrong for fallin' in love
(They always say don't love a ho)

But I just went against the grain
It was a feelin' I can't explain
And it felt like harmony, singin' in my face like
Diddy, daddy, doo, dah, day

I don't want it to ever go away
I want it 'round me every day
Singin' in my face like
Diddy, daddy, doo, dah, day

Look at me, I'm stuck, that bubble in my pants
Got me caught up, I never had no luck
Thinkin' with the wrong head got me
Jumpin' out there with no glove
It feels so good, had me sprung out all messed up
Now I'm stuck

That's what I get for for fallin' in love
That's what I get for for fallin' in love
(They always say don't love a ho)
That's what I get for for fallin' in love
(Don't do it, yo)
That's what I get for for fallin' in love
(They always say don't love a ho)

But I just went against the grain
It was a feelin' I can't explain
And it felt like harmony, singin' in my face like
Diddy, daddy, doo, dah, day

I don't want it to ever go away
I want it 'round me every day
Singin' in my face like
Diddy, daddy, doo, dah, day

So thick, so raw, that oil all over her body
Stole my heart, I'm caught
The way she drop down won't allow me
To close my drawers 'cause I'm already in love
And I knew better from the start, oh, no

I was wrong for fallin' in love
I was wrong for fallin' in love
(They always say don't love a ho)
I was wrong for fallin' in love
(Don't do it, yo)
I was wrong for fallin' in love
(They always say don't love a ho)

But I just went against the grain
I was a feelin' I can't explain
And it felt like harmony
Singin' in my face like
Diddy, daddy, doo, dah, day

I don't want it to ever go away
I want it 'round me every day
Singin' in my face like
Diddy, daddy, doo, dah, day

It was a feelin' I can't explain
And it felt like harmony
Singin' in my face like
Diddy, daddy, doo, dah, day

I don't want it to ever go away
I want it 'round me every day
Singin' in my face like
Diddy, daddy, doo, dah, day
