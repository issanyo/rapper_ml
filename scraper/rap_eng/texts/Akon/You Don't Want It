[Chorus]
Nigga you don't want it
Cause we ain't the one
Bad men raised around scum
Nigga you don't want it
Illegal alien, and I kill people for fun
Nigga you don't want it I heard you pack a big gun
But when the beef come you run
Nigga you don't want it (cause you ain't a gangsta)
Said that you don't want it (cause you ain't a gangsta)

[Verse 1]
See when I come through niggas never asking "who the fuck's you"
Cause they can recognise bad man and crew
'Bout 50 thugs heat near you to put the dot on your head like a Hindu
White T's and my chicks rockin' short skirts
You can see the handgun through the t-shirt
Don't make me change your name to Joe Dirt
Cause we here to work

[Chorus]
Nigga you don't want it
Cause we ain't the one
Bad men raised around scum
Nigga you don't want it
Illegal alien, and I kill people for fun
Nigga you don't want it I heard you pack a big gun
But when the beef come you run
Nigga you don't want it (cause you ain't a gangsta)
Said that you don't want it (cause you ain't a gangsta)

[Verse 2]
This nigga think he hard cause he pack a lil' heat
But like the music boy you will skip a beat
Fuck around with the wrong nigga on the street
You will fall asleep never wake up to eat
You don't want it you don't know now
Get the hell up off my ground, ohh
Life breaking out the beat on the next light
19 Gs on the bricks only if you want it
And that's the lowest I go
Get a better price on the dro cause oh
Got niggas from state to death row
Relaxed and waiting for me to blow
Cause you don't need it
The kinda drama we bring, the one that have your mom hiding
Nigga you don't need it
And I can see it in your eyes that you ain't no thug for life

[Chorus]
Nigga you don't want it
Cause we ain't the one
Bad men raised around scum
Nigga you don't want it
Illegal alien, and I kill people for fun
Nigga you don't want it I heard you pack a big gun
But when the beef come you run
Nigga you don't want it (cause you ain't a gangsta)
Said that you don't want it (cause you ain't a gangsta)
Nigga you don't want it
Cause we ain't the one
Bad men raised around scum
Nigga you don't want it
Illegal alien, and I kill people for fun
Nigga you don't want it I heard you pack a big gun
But when the beef come you run
Nigga you don't want it (cause you ain't a gangsta)
Said that you don't want it (cause you ain't a gangsta)
