(Intro: Akon (Baby Cham))
And this is my story (True ghetto story)
And this is my story (Real ghetto story, Hey!)

(Verse 1: Akon)
See I was born poor like many men and didn't have nothin
Came to America try to make somethin out of somethin
You see we Africans we love huntin
Found my way up to the top like it wasn't nothin
And hooked up with some Puerto Ricans up in Jersey
We used to be called the Baldwin posse
Had it locked we zoned it up to Union City
And a couple of projects in New York City

(Verse 2: Baby Cham)
I remember those days when Hell was my home
When Me and Mama bed was a big piece a foam
An mi never like bathe and my hair never comb
When Mama gone a work me go street go roam
I remember when Danny dem tek me snow cone
An mek him likkle bredda dem kick up Jerome
I remember when we visit dem wid pure big stone
An the boy Danny pop out something weh full chrome

(Verse 3: Akon)
But cats know better than to play around me
And knew I kept the AK displayed around me
And I moved down to the A to find more cheese
And I found out cars make more than we

(Verse 4: Baby Cham)
I remember when we run, Fatta get him knee blown
An mi best friend Richie get, two inna him dome
I remember so the avenue tun inna warzone
An ,Mickey madda fly him out, cau she get a loan
But, Mickey go to foreign and go tun Al Capone
Mek whole heap a money and sen in our own
Now a we a lock the city and, that is well known
Yesterday Mickey call me pan mi phone
Mi say Mickey...

(Chorus: Baby Cham {Akon})
Wi get di ting dem
Dem outta luck now
Mi squeeze seven and the whole a dem a duck now
Wi have whole heap a extra clip cau we nuh bruk now
(This a survival story, True ghetto story)
Rah...Rah..Rah...Rah
Wi get di ting dem, So dem haffi rate wi
{And this is my story, Akon story}
Cau we a tek it to them wicked of lately
And now the whole community a live greatly
(This a survival story, True ghetto story)
Rah...Rah..Rah...Rah

(Verse 5: Baby Cham)
I remember bout '80, Jamaica explode
When a Trinity and Tony Hewitt dem a run road
That a long before Laing dem and even Bigga Ford
When Adams dem a Corporal nuh know the road code
I remember when we rob the chiney shop down the road
An rumour have it sey the chiney man have a sword
But we did have a one pop wey make outta board
So you know the next day mama pot Overlooaad

(Verse 6: Akon)
How could that be? Chop shops in the city call me the ring lead
Never thought I flee, some how the Po' Po' still caught up with me
But then I got locked up, then while we shacked up
Focused on locked up, then they let me out but
Two years later my brother Screw got shot up
And got the whole block royal like now what

(Verse 7: Baby Cham)
Jamaica get screw, tru greed an glutton
Politics manipulate and press yutes button
But we rich now ,so dem caan tell man notin
Cuz a we a mek Mama a nyaam Fish an Mutton..Ehhhh
Ova dehso mek mi tell unnu some'in...
Tru mi dey a foreign now a guy kill me cousin
An mi here sey TD deh dey but him sey he wasn't
Anytime mi fly down him a get bout dozen... Cause...

(Chorus: Baby Cham {Akon})
Wi get di ting dem
Dem outta luck now
Mi squeeze seven and the whole a dem a duck now
Wi have whole heap a extra clip cau we nuh bruk now
(This a survival story, True ghetto story)
Rah...Rah..Rah...Rah
Wi get di ting dem, So dem haffi rate wi
{And this is my story, Akon story}
Cau we a tek it to them wicked of lately
And now the whole community a live greatly
(This a survival story, True ghetto story)
Rah...Rah..Rah...Rah
