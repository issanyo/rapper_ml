(Tay Dizm)
Nappy Boy!
Ooowww!

[Hook: Akon]
(She's just the type) That I been searchin' for all my life
(The type) That'll make a nigga so proud
(The type) That'll rather make love than fight
(The type) That gets it poppin' every single night
She's my dream girl, my one and only
My dream girl, love it when she call on me
She's my dream girl, my lover, my homie
My dream girl, it's just me and you against the world

[Tay Dizm]
Ass poked out like Lisa Ray, jelly hips, thighs, waist, Gabrielle Union's face
Strapped with Oprah Winfrey's cheese, in a house on a hill in the West Indies
If you let me I could give you anything that you need
Speedin', switchin' lanes, wide open
You're what I'm lookin' for, for certain
There's no person that could take your place
I'm like a fat kid with cake when we face to face
Heart paced when you're here but erased when you're gone
Kinda hard to pick a team when your racin' alone

[Hook: Akon]
(She's just the type) That I been searchin' for all my life
(The type) That'll make a nigga so proud
(The type) That'll rather make love than fight
(The type) That gets it poppin' every single night
She's my dream girl, my one and only
My dream girl, love it when she call on me
She's my dream girl, my lover, my homie
My dream girl, it's just me and you against the world

[Tay Dizm]
First time nigga Dizm put his eyes on you
No lie girl, I feel like my dream came true
You a dime plus ten, and a little bit more
And the motions in your hips got your boy like WHOA!
You the type of girl that'd keep a dude fenin for more
Like I feel good girl please let me know

You my dream girl, baby so it's all about you twenty-four seven
Girl Im all about you (and that's real) whenever you need me girl I'm right here

[Hook: Akon]
(She's just the type) That I been searchin' for all my life
(The type) That'll make a nigga so proud
(The type) That'll rather make love than fight
(The type) That gets it poppin' every single night
She's my dream girl (YAY!), my one and only
My dream girl (OK!), love it when she call on me
She's my dream girl (YEAH!), my lover, my homie
My dream girl, it's just me and you against the world

[Tay Dizm]
She's my dream girl, gonna make her my only
She's my dream girl, I want you to put it on me
She's my dream girl, wanna make her my baby
I'm goin' crazy for you
(For you)

(She's just the type) That I been searchin' for all my life
(The type) That'll make a nigga so proud
(The type) That'll rather make love than fight
(The type) That gets it poppin' every single night
She's my dream girl, my one and only
My dream girl, love it when she call on me
She's my dream girl, my lover, my homie
My dream girl, it's just me and you against the world
