Ghetto, ghetto, ghetto, ghetto we livin'

These streets remind me of quicksand
When your on it you'll keep goin' down
And there's no one to hold on too
And there's no one to pull you out you keep on fallin'
And no one can here you callin'
So you end up self destructing

On the corner with the tuli on the waist line
Just got outta the bing doin' state time
Teeth marks on my back from the K9
Dark memories of when there was no sunshine
'Cause they said that I wouldn't make it I remember like yesterday
Holdin' on to what God gave me

'Cause that's the life when your
Living in the
(Ghetto)
And eating in the
(Ghetto)
Or sleeping in the
(Ghetto, ghetto)
That's the life when your
Living in the
(Ghetto)
And eating in the
(Ghetto)
Or sleeping in the
(Ghetto, ghetto, ghetto)

No need to cherish luxuries 'cause everythin' come and go
Even the life that you have is borrowed
'Cause your not promised tomorrow
So live your life as if everyday's goin' be your last
Once you move forward can't go back
Best prepare to remove your past

'Cause ya gotta be willin' to pray
Yes there gotta be there gotta be a better way
Yes ya gotta be willing to pray
'Cause there gotta be there gotta be a better day
Whoever said that the struggle would stop today
A lot of niggas dead or locked away
Teenage women growin' up with AID's

'Cause that's the life when your
Living in the
(Ghetto)
And eatin' in the
(Ghetto)
Or sleepin' in the
(Ghetto, ghetto)
That's the life when your
Livin' in the
(Ghetto)
And eatin' in the
(Ghetto)
Or sleepin' in the
(Ghetto, ghetto, ghetto)

Gun shots every night in the
(Ghetto)
Crooked cops on sight in the
(Ghetto)
Everyday is a fight in the
(Ghetto)
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
(Ghetto)
Got kids to feed in the
(Ghetto)
Sellin' coke and weed in the
(Ghetto)
Everyday somebody bleedin' in the
(Ghetto)
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
(Ghetto)

'Cause that's the life when your
Livin' in the
(Ghetto)
We livin' by the
(Ghetto)
And eatin' in the
(Ghetto, ghetto)
'Cause that's the life your
Livin' in the
(Ghetto)
And sleepin' by the
(Ghetto)
Livin' in the
(Ghetto, ghetto, ghetto)
