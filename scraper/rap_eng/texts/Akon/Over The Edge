I'm here at the crossroad
Where my life is heading? Man, I don't know
Should I stay or should I go?
Cause anything's better than what I've been through

What I would give to get a sign from up above?
Letting me know that everything would be okay
I wish someone would pull me off from out of the mud
Will anyone out there say to me

I'm here, for you
Don't worry cause I got you
Don't trip, don't stress
My life seems to be heading

Over the edge
Feels like I'm heading over the edge
Feels like I'm heading over the edge
Feels like I'm heading over the edge
The edge, the edge

Now everyday that goes by
I see things that'll make another man cry
I'm sitting wondering why
I can't find that someone to fit in my life

See I was searching, but am I worth it?
And did they ever think I'm good enough for love?
Despite my suffering I felt the loving
The blessing came when I needed it the most

And that's the sign that I received from up above
Letting me know that everything would be okay
And that was that something that pulled me out of the mud
And also was the one that said to me

I'm here, for you
Don't worry cause I got you
Don't trip, don't stress
My life seems to be heading

Over the edge
Feels like I'm heading over the edge
Feels like I'm heading over the edge
Feels like I'm heading over the edge
The edge, the edge

I'm here, for you
Don't worry cause I got you
Don't trip, don't stress
My life seems to be heading

Over the edge
Feels like I'm heading over the edge
Feels like I'm heading over the edge
Feels like I'm heading over the edge
The edge, the edge

I'm here, for you
Don't worry cause I got you
Don't trip, don't stress
My life seems to be heading

Over the edge
Feels like I'm heading over the edge
Feels like I'm heading over the edge
Feels like I'm heading over the edge
The edge, the edge
