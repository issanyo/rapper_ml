[Verse 1]
It's been so long
That I haven't seen your face
I'm tryna be strong
But the strength I have is washing away
It won't be long
Before I get you by my side
And just hold you, tease you, squeeze you
Tell you what's been on my mind

[Chorus]
I want to  make up right now
I want to make up right now
Wish we never broke up right now
We need to link up right now
I want to make up right now (na na)
I want to  make up right now (na na)
Wish we never broke up right now (na na)
We need to link up right now (na na)

[Verse 2]
Girl, I know
Mistakes were made between us two
And we show
Our eyes that night, even said some things weren't true
Why'd you go?
I haven't seen my girl since then
Why can't it be that way it was?
'Cause you were my homie, lover, and friend

[Chorus]
I want to  make up right now
I want to make up right now
Wish we never broke up right now
We need to link up right now
I want to make up right now (na na)
I want to  make up right now (na na)
Wish we never broke up right now (na na)
We need to link up right now (na na)

[Verse 3]
I can't lie (I miss you much)
Watching everyday that goes by (I miss you much)
Until I get you back, I'm gonna try (yes, I miss you much)
'Cause you are the apple of my eye (girl, I miss you much, I miss you much)
I can't lie (I miss you much)
Watching everyday that goes by (I miss you much)
Until I get you back I'm gonna try (yes, I miss you much)
'Cause you are the apple of my eye (girl, I miss you much, I miss you much)

[Chorus]
I want to  make up right now
I want to make up right now
Wish we never broke up right now
We need to link up right now
I want to make up right now (na na)
I want to  make up right now (na na)
Wish we never broke up right now (na na)
We need to link up right now (na na)

[Verse 4]
I want you to fly with me (want you to fly)
I miss how you lie with me (miss how you lie)
Just wish you could dine with me (wish you could dine with me)
The one that'll grind with me (said, one that'll grind with me)
I want you to fly with me (want you to fly)
I miss how you lie with me (Oh, miss how you lie)
Just wish you could dine with me (wish you could dine)
The one that'll grind with me (Oh, one that'll grind)
Yeah!

[Chorus]
I want to  make up right now
I want to make up right now
Wish we never broke up right now
We need to link up right now
I want to make up right now (na na)
I want to  make up right now (na na)
Wish we never broke up right now (na na)
We need to link up right now (na na)
I want to make up right now (na na)
I want to  make up right now (na na)
Wish we never broke up right now (na na)
We need to link up right now (na na)
