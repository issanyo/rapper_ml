Workin with 'em snitches
Endin' up another raid
On a cocaine cowboy (cowboy)

On a cocaine cowboy (cowboy)
(This is kon life)
On a cocaine cowboy (cowboy)

[Verse 1: Akon]
Some stone cold killers
With a pocket full of triggers
Here to terrorize your town boy
Considered to be the realist
Of all the other dealers

See they causin' a lot of havic
In movin a lot of traffic
From the white to the brown boy
N' they willin' to get down
Put you up in the crown
Where you can't be found boy
Just so you know they will
Connect that n' they won't be disrespected
Movin' things by the pound boy
So if you want it you get get it
Just be heading south bound n'

See em creepin' round your way
Steady spreadin' it around boy

Searchin' round for that cowboy
They gon get it, it's just about waitin'
For his share boats rockin' by
The docks filled with hundred
Dollar bills bout to be there
Livin' right across the water to
His place straight to a cowboy
N unload it on the spot
Pay a couple gals just to watch
Gotta keep it movin' cause they
Ain't got time on the clock
All it takes is one fuck up
Somebody gets popped
