(Konvict, Konvict...)

[Verse 1 - Akon]
I met her on the walk way
Staring as she walked pass
She looked back at me sideways and said
I can't help but to ask
I said, "You want to be starting something
You got to be starting something
I said you want to be starting something
You got to be starting something"
We end up going back to her place
Wish I could tell you what I saw
The sexiest women in a negligee
We hit it off until the morning
You heard her say

[Hook - Akon]
Ma ma se, ma ma sa, Ma ma ku sa
Ma ma se, ma ma sa, Ma ma ku sa
Ma ma se, ma ma sa, Ma ma ku sa
Ma ma se, ma ma sa, Ma ma ku sa (Why'd I make her say...)
Ma ma se, ma ma sa, Ma ma ku sa
Ma ma se, ma ma sa, Ma ma ku sa
Ma ma se, ma ma sa, Ma ma ku sa
Ma ma se, ma ma sa, Ma ma ku sa

[Verse 2: Akon]
Billie Jean is always talking when nobody else is talking
Telling lies and rubbing shoulders
So they called her mouth a motor
Someone's always trying to start my baby crying
Talking, squealing, lying
Saying you just want to be starting something

[Chorus - Akon]
I said you want to be starting something
You got to be starting something
I said you want to be starting something
You got to be starting something
You're too high to get over (Yeah, yeah)
Too low to get under (Yeah, yeah)
You're stuck in the middle (Yeah, yeah)
And the pain is thunder (Yeah, yeah)
It's too high to get over (Yeah, yeah)
Too low to get under (Yeah, yeah)
You're stuck in the middle (Yeah, yeah)
And the pain is thunder (Yeah, yeah)

[Verse 3: Michael Jackson]
You love to pretend that you're good
When you're always up to no good
You really can't make him hate her
So your tongue became a razor
Someone's always trying to start my baby crying
Talking, Squealing, lying
You got my baby crying

[Chorus - Akon & Michael]
I said you want to be starting something
You got to be starting something
I said you want to be starting something
You got to be starting something
It's too high to get over (Yeah, yeah)
Too low to get under (Yeah, yeah)
You're stuck in the middle (Yeah, yeah)
And the pain is thunder (Yeah, yeah)
It's too high to get over (Yeah, yeah)
Too low to get under (Yeah, yeah)
You're stuck in the middle (Yeah, yeah)
And the pain is thunder (Yeah, yeah)

[Hook - Akon]
Ma ma se, ma ma sa, Ma ma ku sa
Ma ma se, ma ma sa, Ma ma ku sa
Ma ma se, ma ma sa, Ma ma ku sa
Ma ma se, ma ma sa, Ma ma ku sa (Why'd I make her say)
Ma ma se, ma ma sa, Ma ma ku sa
Ma ma se, ma ma sa, Ma ma ku sa (Heeey)
Ma ma se, ma ma sa, Ma ma ku sa
Ma ma se, ma ma sa, Ma ma ku sa (I shouldn't have made her say...)

[Verse 4 - Akon]
It's getting a little crazy (It's getting a little crazy)
Always messing with my baby (messing with my baby)
And that's the reason she cries
When I am not by her side
I have the loneliest night (without my baby)
But what I love 'bout you
Always pop up when I'm thinking about you
I want to bring back the night and share that look on your face
When you say

[Hook]
Ma ma se, ma ma sa, Ma ma ku sa
Ma ma se, ma ma sa, Ma ma ku sa
Ma ma se, ma ma sa, Ma ma ku sa
Ma ma se, ma ma sa, Ma ma ku sa (I'd like to make her say...)
Ma ma se, ma ma sa, Ma ma ku sa
Ma ma se, ma ma sa, Ma ma ku sa
Ma ma se, ma ma sa, Ma ma ku sa
Ma ma se, ma ma sa, Ma ma ku sa

[Chorus]
It's too high to get over (Yeah, yeah)
Too low to get under (Yeah, yeah)
You're stuck in the middle (Yeah, yeah)
And the pain is thunder (Yeah, yeah)
It's too high to get over (Yeah, yeah)
Too low to get under (Yeah, yeah)
You're stuck in the middle (Yeah, yeah)
And the pain is thunder (Yeah, yeah)

It's too high to get over (Yeah, yeah)
Too low to get under (Yeah, yeah)
You're stuck in the middle (Yeah, yeah)
And the pain is thunder (Yeah, yeah)
It's too high to get over (Yeah, yeah)
Too low to get under (Yeah, yeah)
You're stuck in the middle (Yeah, yeah)
And the pain is thunder (Yeah, yeah)
