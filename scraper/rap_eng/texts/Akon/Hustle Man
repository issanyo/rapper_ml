You know, this is not just another song to me
I've been through the struggle and I've been through these years
Man, it's a long way up, that's the story of my life
I'm ready, and nothing's gonna stop me

The cash might not flow, got no dough
Give it just a second and it just might grow
'Cause I work hard, play my cards
Now I'm going to reach up for the stars

You never fail, unless you quit
Listen to your heart and just stick with it
If it is to be, it is up to me
Take two letter words that will talk to me

I don't know how, know how to quit
If you put your mind to it, you can do it
All you gotta do is pursue it
I don't know how, know how to quit
If you put your mind to it, you can do it
All you gotta do is pursue it

I'm a hustle man
Hustle till the day I die
I'm a hustle man
If you don't give up, no, I won't cry
Yes, I'm a hustle man
'Cause I worked so hard and it is my time
I'm a hustle man, my time to shine

So stick to the fight when you're hardest hit
When things seem worse that you mustn't quit
People try to put you down
Saying you can't do it till you might get outta town
But I know deep in my soul
The truth is, I was made for this

I don't know how, know how to quit
If you put your mind to it, you can do it
All you gotta do is pursue it
I don't know how, know how to quit
If you put your mind to it, you can do it
All you gotta do is pursue it

I'm a hustle man
Hustle till the day I die
Yes, I'm a hustle man
If you don't give up, no I won't cry
Yes, I'm a hustle man
'Cause I worked so hard and it's my time
Yes, I'm a hustle man, my time to shine

I'm a hustle man
Hustle till the day I die
Yes, I'm a hustle man
If you don't give up, no I won't cry
Yes, I'm a hustle man
'Cause I worked so hard and it's my time
Yes, I'm a hustle man, my time to shine

Remember, quitters never win
And winners never quit, so what are you?
