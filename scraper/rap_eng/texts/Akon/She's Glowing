[Akon]
I'm looking at an angel
And believe me when I say she got the whole place glowing
She got that whole place glowin (x2)
I'm looking at an angel
And believe me when I say she got the whole place glowing
She got that whole place glowin (x2)

[Verse 1]
She's got the whole place glowing like
Lights be off but she be so bright
She's so right, I'm so wrong
I fucked up, now I'm all alone
What do I need to do to get you back
You've given me a heart-attack
I need you girl
You need me too
I love you
You love me too
You know I'd do whatever
Anything to make it better
I'd kiss you, slowly
I'd make your favorite sauce, guacamole
I'd rub your feet, play with your, massage your back
Just to hear, those words, come off your lips
(What she say, what she sayin'?)
"I love you, Dylan"

[Akon]
I'm looking at an angel
And believe me when I say she got the whole place glowing
She got that whole place glowin (x2)
I'm looking at an angel
And believe me when I say she got the whole place glowing
She got that whole place glowin (x2)


[Verse 2]
I thought everything was just fine
Turns out, I wasn't right
So what, I guess I'm wrong
But guess what, I loved you all along
Baby girl, you know that was no lie
I gave us both a new life
A new attitude to stick to, and baby girl me and you just need to be together
And baby girl you're all I need
When it is cold you are my sleeves
When it is hot you are the leaves falling off of that tree
But now I am that tree
Goddamn, I need you back
Give me your lovin' not a lovin' heart-attack
Goddamn, I love you

I'm looking at an angel
And believe me when I say she got the whole place glowing
She got that whole place glowin (x2)
I'm looking at an angel
And believe me when I say she got the whole place glowing
She got that whole place glowin (x2)
