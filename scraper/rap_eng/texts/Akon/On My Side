[Intro - Nicole Scherzinger/Akon]
Awwhowwoho
Ahwwhowwoho
Konvict
Sellin se selling me
To think that I could leave you
Sellin se selling me
To think that I don't need you
Ahwwww

[Verse 1 - Nicole Scherzinger]
How could I tell somebody what I've been feeling
Looking to be and think that I'll be tripping
But say what you want 'cause baby that means nothing
I play this game but now I'm tired of fighting

[Refrain - Nicole Scherzinger]
Who needs your love and I do
Who needs your touch and
Your call when you caress and I do
Nobody loves me like you
And when I need and I fix nobody do it like you

[Chorus - Nicole Scherzinger]
Sometimes I gotta fight, just to get through it
Think of little me
That I could do (that you on my side)
Sellin se selling me
To think that I could leave you
Sellin se selling me
To think that I don't need you

I got to stop so I don't lose it
Remember 'bout the stakes
But I am closing (that you on my side)
Sellin se selling me
To think that I could leave you (on my side)
Sellin se selling me
To think that I don't need you

[Verse 2 - Nicole Scherzinger]
I'm not your bird without wings, I'm trying to get higher
Keep on my everything light this fire
Wanna talk about you, wanna be about you
Oh 'cause I get to live without you

[Refrain - Nicole Scherzinger]
Who needs your love and I do
Who needs your touch and
Your call when you caress and I do
Nobody loves me like you
And when I need and I fix nobody do it like you

[Chorus - Nicole Scherzinger]
Sometimes I gotta fight, just to get through it
Think of little me
That I could do (that you on my side)
Sellin se selling me
To think that I could leave you
Sellin se selling me
To think that I don't need you

I got to stop so I don't lose it
Remember 'bout the stakes
But I am closing (that you on my side)
Sellin se selling me
To think that I could leave you (on my side)
Sellin se selling me
To think that I don't need you

[Verse 3 - Akon]
Dear God here's my letter
Writing to you cause my life has gotten a lot better
Got heart but I didn't sweat it
Cause I know you'll be there for me no matter the weather
I just wanna say thanks for being there for me every day
And when I got taken away wanted to get away
You made me stronger to continue the fight
You made me give up the life I had on the streets
Gets rough and I've been on the hold on
Never questioned that you're the one that I call Lord
And just wanna show you I appreciate
Thank you for the rest no matter what it is

[Chorus - Nicole Scherzinger 1 x2]
Sometimes I gotta fight, just to get through it
Think of little me
That I could do (that you on my side)
Sellin se selling me
To think that I could leave you
Sellin se selling me
To think that I don't need you

I got to stop so I don't lose it
Remember 'bout the stakes
But I am closing (that you on my side)
Sellin se selling me
To think that I could leave you (on my side)
Sellin se selling me
To think that I don't need you

[Outro - Nicole Scherzinger]
I got to stop so I don't lose it
Remember 'bout the stakes
But I am closing
