[Dolla] (Speech)
Yeah! Hey what up girl, how you doin'
Here's a celebration you wanna talk about
So all you need to do is put your bottles up
And your glasses in the air

(Chorus)
Let's make a toast
We ain't never going back to being broke
Every day stay stacking up the dough
Let's make a toast (Woaaah oh) (Let's make a toast)
Yeeeeah, Let's make a toast
Let's make a toast
How she poppin' when she drop it down low
I just whisper in her ear [Do it slow]
Let's make a toast (Woaaah oh) (Let's make a toast)
Yeeeeah
Let's make a toast

[Dolla verse 1]
We gettin' paper like a billy goat
Remember being really broke?
You should see my safe, boy, that thing look like a jewelry store
Money grow like Chia Pets, I just gotta get it wet
Stretch it out like spandex
We don't rent apartments
We gon' buy the complex bein' broke is nonsense
I don't get the concept but understand the context
Money on my conscience money on my mind
100,000 on the watch
Who said you can't buy time?

(Chorus)
Let's make a toast
We ain't never going back to being broke
Every day stay stacking up the dough
Let's make a toast (Woaaah oh) (Let's make a toast)
Yeeeeah, Let's make a toast
Let's make a toast
How she poppin' when she drop it down low
I just whisper in her ear [Do it slow]
Let's make a toast (Woaaah oh) (Let's make a toast)
Yeeeeah
Let's make a toast

[Dolla verse 2]
Let's make a toast cuz we gettin' it, and we already got it
If you can't see me now, wait 'til I stand on ma wallet
If money is a topic, you consider me in
I get that guaranteed money 'fore the season begin
We can fly in any weather, touch the season we in
That's winter, summer, spring, fall
And we get it again, let's make a toast
[I forgot, what's the reason again?]

[Oh we got Pablo at the bar and he be sneaking 'em in]
That's why she leaving her man
It's just me and a friend
I told her meet me at the telly, I could teach you to bend
Keep on playing wit' them losers, I could teach you to win
20 bottles of the Spade, I could teach you to spend

(Chorus)
Let's make a toast
We ain't never going back to being broke
Every day stay stacking up the dough
Let's make a toast (Woaaah oh) (Let's make a toast)
Yeeeeah, Let's make a toast
Let's make a toast
How she poppin' when she drop it down low
I just whisper in her ear [Do it slow]
Let's make a toast (Woaaah oh) (Let's make a toast)
Yeeeeah
Let's make a toast

[Julian verse 3]

[Dolla verse 4]
Hey make a toast to the Benjamins
Chaloupas in the dividend
Fettuccini pasta, and all the other synonyms
Women I be swimming' in
Carolyn and Marylyn, Virginia and Savannah
It feel good to be American
I done hit the cities and left jackas in the ambulance
Chillin' in your house
Waitin' on you like a brutha man
When it come to the money I don't under, I overstand
Middle finger in the air, bottle in my other hand

(Chorus)
Let's make a toast
We ain't never going back to being broke
Every day stay stacking up the dough
Let's make a toast (Woaaah oh) (Let's make a toast)
Yeeeeah, Let's make a toast
Let's make a toast
How she poppin' when she drop it down low
I just whisper in her ear [Do it slow]
Let's make a toast (Woaaah oh) (Let's make a toast)
Yeeeeah
Let's make a toast'
