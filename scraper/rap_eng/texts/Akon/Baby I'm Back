Don't look no farther! (Yeah)
Baby I'm back (yeah)

I'm here to cater to you (any thing that you want me to I'll do it)
Cause I'll be your lover (I'll be your lover)
I'll be your best friend
Tell me what I gotta do (tell me what I gotta do and I'll do it)

[Baby Bash]
Now I'm back in the flesh
Feelin' so blessed, back in your corner sugar, sugar don't stress
Forget about the rest; let's go inside, I'm back in your zone
Baby I'm back in your vibe, now I can't be denied I can lie I'm on ya
I never ever wanna say "Sayonara"
Somebody told me that the grass was greener
On the other side andale arriba
Never really intended on being a cheater
What I gotta do to be your keeper
These words comin' out the speaker, true love is off the meter

[Baby Bash]
I was gone for a minute but now I'm home
Please forgive me for being a rolling stone
Please forgive me let me polish it up like chrome
Get off the phone till he swears to leave you alone
Let me spark your interest, now there's no more dating on the internet
'Cause you already know how I get it wet, how I keep it so saucy and I get respect
You don't have to look no farther, you dealin' with the whole enchilada
You don't have to look no farther, you hotter then a fire starter
