What up John (testing one, two, three)
What up Kon (hey convict music)
Let's go (can you believe it)

Fresh white tee, fresh car walls, summertime hood niggas look like stars
Jewelry drip, fresh white airs
Mommy shake it up keep your ass right there (oh, can you believe it?)
My man got liquor and my cup's right here
I can smell smoke pass the dutch right here
Nigga pass that, Capri pants with the waist cut off
I wanna smash that (oh, can you believe it?)
Party ran pack, mingling baby, and I can LL shake, you jingling baby?
Back your ass up, I'm a start tingling baby
We can have more fun if wiggling baby (yea, can you believe it?)
P hit the club with a dutch and a dub with it
Nigga don't cuff it if you ain't in love with it
Matter fact let the grub get it
Please don't hate cause at least you can say you was with it

[Chorus]
Can you believe it? Get a break and get off the streets
Clear my mind from the shit I see
In a world full of smoke, contact from the weed
That's when it really bond on me
I'm a be here for life, I ain't never gonna leave
The ghetto is all that I know
It's just another day in the hood my nigga
Laying back trying get this dough
Yellin out ohhhhh, all up in the club
And you know how we roll, squad deep like oh
Bad little bitch*s with their booty on score trying to beat like whoa
Know your ass feel it cause its outta control
Let me hear you say oh, let me hear you say oh oh
Can you believe it?

Big ass truck, brand new rims, tank top Yankee, tanned out Tims
Bracelet, chain, fronts bob thin, new tattoos
New black shoes (hey, can you believe it?)
Gucci, Ermays, do that too
Wanna feel the breeze get a new black coupe
Nigga drop the top, come through the hood
Put a hundred on your three or your foul line shot
(ooh, ooh, oh can you believe it?)
Lending outfits all in the bus cause none of us could
See a summer without trips (none of us can see it)
Mad hoops so the little boys might bark at you
But they all lack good if the hood bothered you

Can you believe it?
Get a break and get off the streets
Clear my mind from the shit I see
In a world full of smoke, attack from the weed
That's when it really bond on me
I'm a be here for life, never gonna leave
The ghetto is all that I know
It's just another day in the hood my nigga
Laying back trying get this dough
Yellin out oh, all up in the club and you know how we roll
Squad deep like oh
Bad little bitch*s with their booty on score trying to beat like whoa
Know your ass feel it cause its outta control
Let me hear you say oh, let me hear you say oh oh
Can you believe it?

Basketball tournament, pitbull pups
Ladies in the club poring Chris in cups
Niggas in the jail calling home on the phone (cause they locked up)
But you still trying to act like ain't shit enough
Mad sieves in the park, mad fights in the park
Niggas talk how they run every night from the narcs
Aside from the light to the dark then the dark to the light
I wanna smoke but I could search for my life

Can you believe it?
I've done spent ten again, watching her bend again, dancing for many men
Tell me have ever though about getting in
A room full of convicts and D Block militants
We'll show you the time of your life
You can occupy my passenger side
Introduce you to the street life
Watch you fall in love after just one night
Ohhhh, all up in the club and you know how we roll
Squad deep like oh
Bad little bitches with their booty on score trying to beat like whoa
Know your ass feel it cause its outta control
Let me hear you say oh, let me hear you say oh oh
Can you believe it?

Can you believe it? (Can you believe it? )
Lil' John, Akon, S.P. the ghost
Feel what we trying to do (Can you believe it? )
Can you believe it (Can you believe it? )
