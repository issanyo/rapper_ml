[Intro: Chamillionaire]
I'm lookin in my rearview
And I can see a clearer view of you
This is the remix, I see you waitin, I know you hatin...

[Hook: Akon]
I see them watchin, they waitin
For an opportunity to ride up on me
Hopin they don't roll up on me, cause today I'm ridin dirty
And if they stop me, I might be goin to jail tonight
I see them watchin, and waitin
For an opportunity to ride up on me
Hopin they don't roll up on me, cause today I'm ridin dirty
And if they stop me, I might be goin to jail tonight

[Verse 1: Chamillionaire]
(Ch-chea! Chamillitary mayne, uh, yeah)
I got 20 grand in my pocket and
I'm ridin' around with my pockets crammed
You the one that got the contraband
And you smokin that like you in Amsterdam
Before I know it, I see them sirens
I'm pullin' over - aye, we just ridin'!
Don't talk back, won't be no violence
Just shut up, and sit in your seat in silence
Now the police is searchin who?
They searchin me and then they searchin you
They smell the breeze and you smell like trees
Cause you hit the blunt and hit the purple, too
Now the lie is irreversable
Because you just told 'em we were ridin' clean
They question you, but they ain't question me yet
I'm thinkin the police ain't find a thing
Standin on the side of the freeway
Wishing they would just hurry up
And I can see, you walkin up to me
Like he about to put me up in them cuffs
I turned around and I look at you
And you look away like you feeling sick
I'm goin to jail for what I didn't commit
I must admit, that I hate a snitch

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Chamillionaire]
Ever since they heard the song "Ridin' Dirty"
The whole world been listening, I'm glad you heard me
Some cops that representin the badge assure me
Every cop ain't bad or tryin to scurr me
A year after "White and Nerdy"
On the grind, still tryin, still flyin birdies
That stuff still in ya cup, still drivin' swervy
Ridin dirty like the vehicle inside the derby
A little inspired by U.G.K
And the rest inspired by the life I'm livin
Seen that Impala, he was drunk
And that's when I saw the red lights go get 'em
And it's ironic that during the chase
Seen "Murder Chase", and this kid was Christian
Movin target ran across the street
And unfortunately the car didn't miss him
And now the family is soon to know
That they gon have to do another funeral
The angels ain't singin to ya tune no more
Don't move too fast, baby move it slow
Cause one day ya here, baby
Next thing ya know, next thing ya know
Everything that used to move don't move no more

[Hook]

[Outro: Chamillionaire]
(This is not a movie, it's real life, yeah, yeah...)
It's real life, it ain't just a song, it's a message
Nobody ever opens they eyes till somebody gets killed
Rest in peace to Sean Bell
Chamillitary Mayne
