We still playin' by hood rules
We about to ride out, ski masks down
Let's go
Yeah

Hook
[Akon]
Loadin' up banana clips in the jeep, sittin' in the back seat
Four deep on the creep, 'bout to fire on these niggas, ride on these niggas
'Cause this how we live everyday as a gangsta
Loadin' up banana clips in the jeep, sittin' in the back seat
Four deep on the creep, 'bout to fire on these niggas, ride on these niggas
'Cause that's how we live everyday as a gangsta

Verse 1
[Tru Life]
I'm in the back of the Pontiac (*car peeling off*)
Puttin' shells in the clips, click clackin' the tommy back
Sern was driving you know he was leaked up
Bones was in the back seat, had to be geeked up (*snorting coke*)
Jaw was straight stiff, mad wired (wired)
We about to make the papers, man down shots fired
Niggas killed my nigga, my heart big biz
Baptised my son, I baptised his
I gotta ride, take the life who took is
We've been down since the Johnny Pump (yeah)
I can't let it slide, gotta let the shotty dump
Did it all together, even our communion
Played ball together, we was like the union (union)
We fought one time, the first time he moved in (I remember that)
We use to tell the hoes we was cousins (cousins)
Now I can't believe you gone, I'm sittin' here buggin'

Verse 2
[Tru Life]
It's been 36 hours, still ain't slept (nah)
Lookin' at pictures of us, when we were fresh to death (man)
We brung meanin' to the word pimpin'
Two pretty gangsters who just wouldn't listen (mwah)
Just got the call where they layin' at (layin' at)
I'm thinking crazy right now, I know where his kid stayin' at
Lord forgive me, the rage got me
He was the only one who banged out when niggas shot me
Slow the car up, pull the window down
Feel it in the air, nigga it's going down
I hopped out, caught him playing dice
Spit a lunky (*coughing up phlegm*) in his face, then I shot him twice
Shot him again, then I shot him again
I ain't miss nigga, yeah, I got him again
Then I pulled the picture out, like remember him?
(You remember him mother fucker?!)
