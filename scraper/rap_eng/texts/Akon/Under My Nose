First kiss, when I touched your lips
I admit I was nervous, baby
My friend, the only one that I could
Share my heart with, baby
We rushed too fast into this
Only in time will tell

'Cause we don't know
If love will affect our friendship
It's a risk though
It's a risk that I want to take
'Cause baby, you know
That I'll never leave your side
'Cause girl, I've realized that

You've been under my nose, my nose
After everythin' that we've been through
You've been under my nose, my nose
I can't believe I overlooked you
Right under my nose, my nose
Momma, I had you steady searchin'
For somethin' that's been here all along

It was like I was plannin' for gold
When I have a diamond mine just waitin' at home
And it took forever to see that you were match for me
I never saw this comin', no

Can't stop, it's not exactly the truth
I've always been attracted to you
But I didn't want to ruin what we had
Thought of losin' you, it made me sad
We rushed too fast into this
Only in time will tell

You've been under my nose, my nose
After everythin' that we've been through
You've been under my nose, my nose
I can't believe I overlooked you
Right under my nose, my nose
Momma, I had you steady searchin'
For somethin' that's been here all along

You've been under my nose, my nose
After everythin' we've been through
You've been under my nose, my nose
I can't believe I overlooked you
Right under my nose, my nose
Why am I out here steady searchin'?
For somethin' that's been here all along

Did you ever think that I would be
[Incomprehensible]
[Incomprehensible]

You've been under my nose, my nose
After everythin' that we've been through
You've been under my nose, my nose
I can't believe I overlooked you
Right under my nose, my nose
Momma, I had you steady searchin'
For somethin' that's been here all along

You've been under my nose, my nose
After everythin' we've been through
You've been under my nose, my nose
I can't believe I overlooked you
Right under my nose, my nose
Why am I always steady searchin'?
For somethin' that's been here all along

Girl, you know you that you are mine
