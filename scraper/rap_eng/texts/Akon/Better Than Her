(What up, girl?)
I can do it better than her
I can do it better than her
I can do it better than her

I'll do it better than her
I'll do it better than her
I'll do it better than her

Hey, Akon
I'm looking at you, I'm looking at my girl
And it's making me wanna go and question
What I'ma do with you in my world
When I just replace you with that blessing

But I don't know, I can just hear you talking
About your good sex lessons
Need you to show me that weapon
Otherwise I can just keep on steppin', girl

You hear there was a party
Tonight and I'd be here
I just saw you lookin' at me
Even though she's here

Every time I turn around
You seem to be worried about me
(Is dat right?)
What about me?
(Is dat right, girl?)

I can settle down for the things you like
I'm a girl who can take the lead
But I'm still the fall back type

Give you the space you need
Even though I can't explain
How I do the damn thang
I would put it on my life that I

I'll do it better than her
I'll do it better than her
I'll do it better than her
I can do it better than her

I'll do it better than her
I'll do it better than her
I'll do it better than her
I can do it better than her
I can do it better than

Hey, hey, hey
If you can do it better
Say hey, hey, hey
Everyone together now

Hey, hey, hey
If you can do it better say
Hey, hey, hey
(Bring it down)

You showed up to the party
For all the wrong reasons
She said if you look over again
That she's leavin'

I don't really feel so bad
Cause I know ya better without her
(Is dat right?)
What about her?
(Is dat right, girl?)

You settle down for the things you like
I'm a girl who can take the lead
But I'm still the fall back type

I'll give you what you need
And even though I can't explain
How I do the damn thang
I can show you tonight

I'll do it better than her
I'll do it better than her
I'll do it better than her
I can do it better than her

I'll do it better than her
I'll do it better than her
I'll do it better than her
I can do it better than her
I can do it better than

Hey, hey, hey
If you can do it better
Say hey, hey, hey
Everyone together now

Hey, hey, hey
If you can do it better say
Hey, hey, hey

Not only did you come back
And throw that body on me
But you made a non-believer see a miracle, miracle
Now I got to decide to do the right thing

Like I was Spike Lee
Tell me would you allow her
To break you off
Break you off

Shake it on me, shake it on me
Shake it on me
Go ahead and break it on me
Girl, just make a statement on me

Shake it on me, shake it on me
Shake it on me
Go ahead, now break it on me
Girl, just make a statement on me

Hey, hey, hey
If you can do it better
Say hey, hey, hey
Everyone together now

Hey, hey, hey
If you can do it better say
Hey, hey, hey

I'm still better than her
I'm still better than her
(So you can do it better, girl)

I'm still better than her
I'm still better than her
(So you can do it better, girl)

I'm still better than her
I'm still better than her
(So you can do it better, girl)

I'm still better than her
I'm still better than her
(You can do it better, girl)

I'm still better than her
I'm still better than her
I'm still better than her

I'm still better than her
I'm still better than her
I'm still better than her
(You can do it, better)
