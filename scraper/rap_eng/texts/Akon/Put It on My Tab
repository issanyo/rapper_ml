Hey, sexy body, keepin' low key, is with nobody
Chillin' in the spot, so hot
Fellas walk by ya and they wanna try
To get up in your face and holler
Talk about what they got

Don't they know that you're not the type of
Girl to take 'em home for one night
You just came to have a drink

Chorus:
Put it on my tab, I'm buying, I'm sending a bottle your way
Put it on my tab cause you had a long day
Put it on my tab, I'm buying, I'm sending another your way
Put it on my tab, keep doing your thing
Put it on my tab, oh..

Hey, pretty lady, lookin' at you
I'm thinking maybe I can slide up and talk
Feel my active, feeling attraction
Gotta brother thinking of asking if I could know your name
Your age, your sign, what's on your mind

You might think that I'm the type of cat
That wants to hit it tonight
But I just came to have a drink

Chorus

Akon: Hey Mr. Bartender, please make a pina colada
Hold the alcohol, please
And whatever baby girl is sippin' on right there
You can tell her drink is on me
'Cause we got money to burn, as if it really grow on trees
'Cause her beautiful body got me willing to party
And she got a big hold on me
She's holding, oh yes, she's holding
Holding on as much as I'm holding back
Steady, tryin' to keep her mind on me
You're the reason why I'm tossing these stacks
As a matter of fact, tonight the drinks free

Chorus 3x
