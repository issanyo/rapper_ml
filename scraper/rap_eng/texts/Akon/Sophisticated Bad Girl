Every time I saw you, girl
I wanted to walk up to you
And make a move, and make a move
Every time misleadin', girl, I'm not turnin' back
Now it's time to act

Maybe, baby, I could call you up
Grab your cell and fall in love
No girl, I'm just kiddin?
I just really wanted to hook up

Interested in you
Are you interested in me?
This girl has got the game on lock
Homie, can't you see?

She's a sophisticated bad girl
Tryin' to make her mine
She's a sophisticated bad girl
But I'm runnin' outta time

She's a sophisticated bad girl
Tryin' to make her mine
She's a sophisticated bad girl
But I'm runnin? outta time

If I could just spoil you to a date
A day of happenin?, a day of pamperin'
And all I ask is to just hear you say
You wanna do it again, you wanna do it again

Maybe, baby, I could call you up
Grab your cell and fall in love
No, girl, I'm just kiddin?
I just really wanted to hook up

Interested in you
Are you interested in me?
This girl has got the game on lock
Homie, can't you see?

She's a sophisticated bad girl
Tryin' to make her mine
She's a sophisticated bad girl
But I'm runnin' outta time

She's a sophisticated bad girl
Tryin' to make her mine
She's a sophisticated bad girl
But I'm runnin? outta time

We can go to the mall
Just shop all day and get your heart desires
And if you don't wanna go
Just try to listen, I'll be your goal for high

Expect the best
'Cause you're nothin' like the rest
Just stop for a sec and think

She's a sophisticated bad girl
Tryin' to make her mine
She's a sophisticated bad girl
But I'm runnin' outta time

She's a sophisticated bad girl
Tryin' to make her mine
She's a sophisticated bad girl
But I'm runnin? outta time

She's a sophisticated bad girl
She's a sophisticated bad girl
She's a sophisticated bad girl
She's a sophisticated bad girl
