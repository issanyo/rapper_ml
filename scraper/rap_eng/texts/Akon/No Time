[Verse 1: Akon]
See, I ain't got time for these niggas
No time for these lames
I ain't got time for bitches, no
No time for these games
Just another nigga on the grind
Steady tryna make a killin'
And I ain't really for no waisting time
Cause that kinda shit hurt my feelings
Got a large amount of dope
And it ain't from [??]
Got a black op [??]
Keep it tucked, hidden under my coat
(woo, woo)
Lovin' the way that I'm living
What I'm doing for
But when I say they don't believe me
That I'll never go broke
Its infinity bro
Gotta get it cause its [??] me bro

[Verse 2: Money Man]
I went and put my life on the line
I buy them bricks 10 at a time
She wanna open up her thigh
And look a real nigga in the eye
Shout out [??] for the mention
Shout out Seattle for the pressure
All them bags, nigga come with that shit
I know the broads in every state
These broke niggas love to hate
Came out the trenches, I made a way
Pour an eight and then fade away
I'm a plug, nigga show respect
I drop a hunnit Ps on a fan
I just can't lie like I'm on the stand
I just can't hate on another man
I shoot a lil nigga in the face
Then go to church and say my grace
She gimme head on her knees like she pray
I drop a verse, then I go make a play
I drop a turd, then I fly to the bay
And mail a hunnit to the A
I turn a predator into a prey
Just got a foreign watch by a [??]

[Hook: Akon]
I ain't got time, no time, no time...

No
I ain't got time, no time, no time...

[Verse 3: Akon]
So I ask my self "What have you done for me lately?"

Gotta get it all, get it no matter what stand in my way
