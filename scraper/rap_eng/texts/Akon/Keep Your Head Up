[Verse 1]
When the stars ain't really lining up
And your family don't show you love
Everybody 'round you don't know who to trust
Looking at the numbers, then ain't adding up
When the water'round you is getting deep
And the shore's too far out of reach
When you're going through your rough time
Maybe I could be your lifeline

[Chorus]
Keep your head up, when you're down
Keep your head up, when you're alone
Keep your head up, when you're underwater can't breathe
Feelin' like you're drown
Keep your head up through the dark
Keep your head up, when it's hard
Keep your head up, when the love runs out
And you need somebody right now

[Post-Chorus]
And you need somebody right now
Keep your head up, keep your head up
Keep your head up, keep your head up
Keep your head up, keep your head up
Keep on the, keep on the, keep on your head up

[Verse 2]
When everything goes from good to bad
And you realize all the things you had
When they come to repossess your cars
And your friends stop taking all your calls
When the water 'round you is getting deep
And the shore's too far out of reach
When you're going through your rough time
Maybe I could be your lifeline

[Chorus]
Keep your head up, when you're down
Keep your head up, when you're alone
Keep your head up, when you're underwater can't breathe
Feelin' like you're drown
Keep your head up through the dark
Keep your head up, when it's hard
Keep your head up, when the love runs out
And you need somebody right now

[Post-Chorus]
When you need somebody right now
Keep your head up
When you need somebody right now
Keep your head up, keep your head up
Keep your head up, keep your head up
Keep your head up, keep your head up
Keep on the, keep on the, keep on your head up

[Bridge]
(I know)
It can help sometimes
(I know, I know)
When the sun don't shine
(I know)
When the love runs out
And you need somebody right now
(I know)
When the love runs out
And you need somebody right now

[Chorus]
Keep your head up, when you're down
Keep your head up, when you're alone
Keep your head up, when you're underwater can't breathe
Feelin' like you're drown
Keep your head up through the dark
Keep your head up, when it's hard
Keep your head up, when the love runs out
And you need somebody right now
