(Intro)
Dream, dream, dream
Warriors!

(Chorus)
We own the nightlife
Under the spotlight
Here, it the highlight
Warriors
Under the moonlight
We light up the night sky
Dancing 'til daylight
Warriors

(Interlude)
Better dream
Better speak
Better learn
Better think
Do you dare to conquer?
Better do
Better be
Better learn
How to dream
What's your dream?
What's your dream?

(Verse)
Warriors!
Lift you up!
We lift you up!
Under the street lights
We only do what's right
Bring guns to a night fight
We warriors!
G6 is what we fly
Masseuse through the blue sky
What it sound like when doves cry
We warriors

(Interlude)
Better dream
Better speak
Better learn
Better think
Do you dare to conquer?
Better do
Better be
Better learn
How to dream
What's your dream?
What's your dream?

Warriors
We don't judge
Warriors
We don't fight
