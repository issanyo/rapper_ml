I've had a little bit too much, much
All of the people start to rush, start to rush by
A dizzy, twisted dance
Can't find my drink oh man
Where are my keys I lost my phone

What's going on, on the floor
I love this record baby but I can't see straight anymore
Keep it cool, what's the name of this club
I don't remember but it's alright, I'm alright

Just dance, it's gonna be okay da da doo-doom
Just dance, spin that record babe da da doo-doom
Just dance, it's gonna be okay
Da da da
Dance, dance, dance
Just, just, just, just dance
