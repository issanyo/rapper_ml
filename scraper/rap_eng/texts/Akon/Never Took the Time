[Verse 1]
A moment ago it seemed, it was yesterday
You were here with me
And everything seems to be the same
What am I supposed to do
With all these empty rooms?
Sit here in solitude
With the smell of your perfume

[Hook]
You never took the time to know me
You never took the time to understand
You never took the time to know me, yeah
‘Cause loving you is all I ever had
Said loving you is all I ever had

[Verse 2]
This wasn't what I wanted to be
A man in misery
Girl, I look back a thousand times
And can't believe that you left me
(Why you leave me, baby?)
Why can't you understand my pain?
How can I explain?
Girl, I don't know what I'm doing wrong
I can't believe that your love is gone

[Hook]
‘Cause you never took the time to know me
(Said you never took the time to know me)
You never took the time to understand (ohhhhh yeah)
Said you never took the time to know me
(Said you never took the time to know me)
See, loving you is all I ever had (had, I had)
Baby, loving you is all I ever had

[Instrumental for 33 seconds]

[Over hook]
Ooh yeah, you're all I need
You're all I see
And I wish that we could do it again

[Hook/Outro]
‘Cause you never took the time to know me
(Baby, you never took the time to know me)
You never took the time to understand
(Ohh-ohh-ohh, ohhh, yeah)
Said you never took the time to know me, yeah (ohhh)
Because of you, now I'm just a lonely man (ohh)
Because of you, now I'm just a lonely man
