[Intro: Akon]
Konvict... {*jail bars close*}
Akon... and E-40, ohh yeah

[Hook: Akon]
I know you ain't used to havin real niggas like me around
I'm here to change to your whole life girl, so you don't deal with clowns
And treat you like a superstar that you are
Cause I'm a superstar too and I know exactly what I must do to make you...
(FEEL!) I'm about to wake it up, (FEEL!) See I'm about to wake it up
(FEEL!) I'm about to wake it up; don't it feel so good girl?
(FEEL!) I'm about to wake it up, (FEEL!) See I'm about to wake it up
(FEEL!) I'm about to wake it up; don't it feel so good girl?

[Verse 1: E-40]
I keep it 100's, don't carry nothing but 100's
I'm trying to wake it up, I'm on your line like Vonage
I'm a real one, ma, get rid of that clown, get with a factor
Patna don't count, he a lame he don't matter
Shining like a big dipper, glowing like a star
Lookin' up a paw, pullin' up in my car
Walked right up to the front where the bosses park at
I got a cold mouth piece can talk a chick out her check
Security loves me, let me in with no sweat
I see asian persuasion, caucasian, all kinds of chicks
Milk skin, chocolate boned, lambs and Haitians
Tryna take me something home and have some relation

[Hook]

[Verse 2: E-40]
Good God Almighty! Look at that body
What you holdin'? Girl you a banger!
You ain't off the back porch, you're off the Hanger!
You working with something, you gotta personal trainer?
Whole crew fine but you're one of a kind
You a ten piece, shawty you a dime
Back that thang up, baby press rewind
I'mma Scorpio, shawty whats your sign?
I'm just tryna know you, hold a conversation
Spoil you a lil', lightweight cupcakin'
Spend a lil gouda, get your hair done up
I'mma show you how a tycoon wake that thang up

[Hook]

[Interlude: Akon]
Don't stop get it get it
Bout' to jump up all in it
Love the way you drop low and bend it
Girl you're killin' me, wait a minute
Love the way you that shake it up
Too natural you to make it up
Won't be long for we wake it up
(That's right)
