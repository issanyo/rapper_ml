Hourglass shape make a place go 'woo!'
Waistline makes my soldier salute

High heels push up ya ass last name
And you livin' in the fast lane, eyes like an angel
Goddess, watch my gal and how she undress

Spotless, heartless, bad to the bone
Make me wanna go put me in the triple-X zone
Lames don't know how to talk to you

Not like a hooker but more like a Princess
