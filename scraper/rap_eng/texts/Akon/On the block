Konvict music upfront
Gotta get my block sold up... ya know me
Gotta get my block sold up... ya know me
Eyo gringo, eyo gringo
I heard you want some marijuana
Want some pure white coca
Eyo gringo, eyo gringo
You see I've never been a smoker
I'm just your neighborhood dealer
And I'm tryin' to keep my block sold up
Tryin' to keep my block sold up
Tryin' to keep my block sold up
Tryin' to keep my block sold up
Tryin' to keep my block sold up
Tryin' to keep my block sold up
Tryin' to keep my block sold up
Tryin' to keep my block sold up
See I woke up early as hell one morning
And I noticed my stash was half gone
'Cause these fiends can't stop smokin my rocks
'Cause lately around my way these niggas been warrin'
Fightin' for teritory that's mine
'Cause these cats can't stop liquors or shots
I'ma show you right now the only reason the block is movin'
I got dubs at the price of a dime
That's why I'm on top and it don't stop
'Cause I get it so cheap no matter what I won't be losin'
Re-up spots is so hard to find
But I got one cool ass mexican
Eyo gringo, eyo gringo
I heard you want some marijuana
Or some pure white coca
Eyo gringo, eyo gringo
You see I've never been a smoker
I'm just your neighborhood dealer
And I'm tryin' to keep my block sold up
Tryin' to keep my block sold up
Tryin' to keep my block sold up
Tryin' to keep my block sold up
Tryin' to keep my block sold up
Tryin' to keep my block sold up
Tryin' to keep my block sold up
Tryin' to keep my block sold up
You can find me on the other side of the border
With a hundred grand in my pocket
For the first trip just pack a little bit
'Cause I'ma bring the work back by air or even by water
What ever it take to get to the crib
Gotta play it safe cause they out there
See I got so much clientele home waiting
I can't just make one trip
But I gotta get enough to supply the city
But I gotta be careful smugglin' in
Vaseline Reynolds Wrap to hide the scent
Off on the next trip while I wait for Jose
He'll bring it to me
Eyo gringo, eyo gringo
I heard you want some marijuana
Or some pure white coca
Eyo gringo, eyo gringo
You see I've never been a smoker
I'm just your neighborhood dealer
And I'm tryin' to keep my block sold up
Tryin' to keep my block sold up ohhh
Tryin' to keep my block sold up
Tryin' to keep my block sold up
Just tryin' to keep my block sold up
Tryin' to keep my block sold up
I said I'm just tryin' to keep my block sold up
Tryin' to keep my block sold up
Cause I'm a konvict
Never gonna be a convict
'Cause I'm a konvict
Never gonna be a convict
