[Verse 1: Akon]
Miles in between us
It's been so long since we last talked
I hear your voice grow weary
On the line every day we have to say goodbye

[Chorus: Akon]
A hustler's ambition keeps me on the road
I do it for our family that I need to provide for
I know you're tired of sleeping alone
Cause I've been gone so long, so lo-lo-lo-long
Girl tonight, tonight
'Fore you turn off the lights, off the lights
Lay your head on my pillow and close your eyes, close your eyes
Pray I'll make it back home safe tonight, safe tonight
And when you wake up, I'm by your side
I'll be home in the morning
Home in the morning, home in the morning, home in the morning
I'll be home in the morning

[Verse 2: Monica]
How I wish you could stay
Still I pack your suitcase just the same
Don't know how long you'll be away
But these pictures in the frame
We must be together every day, yeah

[Chorus: Monica + (Akon)]
A hustler's ambition keeps you on the road
You do it for our family that you need to provide for
I know you're tired of sleeping alone
Cause you've been gone so long, so long long long
Boy tonight (tonight)
Will you turn out the lights (out the lights)
Lay your head on my pillow and close your eyes (close your eyes)
Pray you'll make it back home safe tonight (safe tonight)
And when you wake up, I'm by your side
You'll be home in the morning

[Bridge: Akon + (Monica)]
Sunlight shines upon your face
Sunlight upon your face
Put down my bags and crawl into bed, crawl into bed
Try not to wake you as I put my arm around your waist
(Oh, but I know you're there)
(I feel whispers in my hair)

[Outro: Akon + (Monica)]
Girl tonight (tonight)
'Fore you turn off the lights (turn the lights)
Lay your head on my pillow and close your eyes (close your eyes)
Pray I'll make it back home safe tonight (make it safe, baby)
And when you wake up, I'm by your side (by your side)
I'll be home in the morning (oooh oh-oooh oh-oh-oh)
Home in the morning, home in the morning, home in the morning (in the morning)
I'll be home in the morning
I'm home in the morning, home in the morning (I'm home)
Home in the morning, I'll be home in the morning
(I'm on my way)
(I'm coming home to you)
(I'll be there in the morning)
