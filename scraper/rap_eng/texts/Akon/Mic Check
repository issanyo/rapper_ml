[Verse 1: Keri Hilson]
I let you talk, and even though you overreact
I try to listen, didn't give you any feedback
Every time I tell you what I need, you don't care how much I bleed
Am I coming through? Check, 1, 2, 1, 2
Down to the wire, you're over looking the red lights
And every little issue is amplified
I'm feelin' unheard, went back like reverb
Coming from my tears over you, 1, 2, 1, 2

[Bridge]
Had to turn it up a notch (one notch), hate to fuss
Better listen up, better listen up
Cause it's over, I had enough, I'm tired of keeping it down
Not gonna bottle it up, you're 'bout to hear me out

[Hook]
Mic check c'mon, mic check 1, 2, c'mon
It's the final round, I'm 'bout to bounce
Baby I'm out, can you hear me now?
Mic check c'mon, mic check 1, 2, c'mon
It's the final round, I'm 'bout to bounce
Baby I'm out, can't you hear me now?

[Verse 2: Keri Hilson]
You cut me off 'fore I started, I'm not gon' run it back
You told me that I gave you static and I mean that
I mapped it out, I gave you clues, now I'm blowing a fuse
Am I getting through? Check 1, 2, 1, 2
Sike, read my facial expressions, see how I'm pulling back
You say I'm tripping, bet you'd like me to believe that
I'm standing my ground
Yup, stubborn and I'm proud
Am I gettin through? Check 1, 2, 1, 2

[Bridge]

[Hook]
Mic check c'mon, mic check 1, 2, c'mon
It's the final round, I'm 'bout to bounce
Baby I'm out, can you hear me now?
Mic check c'mon, mic check 1, 2, c'mon
It's the final round, I'm 'bout to bounce
Baby I'm out, can't you hear me now?

[Verse 3: Akon]
You said I switched it up, not sticking to the game plan
Now you're talking down on me like I'm Rainman
Feel like acting a fool, I'm tryna keep it cool
Whatchu expect me to do? Check 1, 2, 1, 2
I let your speakers bump, turn up the volume
I heard you loud and clear, baby girl it's all you
So if you wanna leave, baby there's the door
I ain't gonna hold you here if you really wanna go
I'ma need that whip, kick rocks, take the bus
Better hurry up, better hurry up
If you need your space, baby that's what's up
I'ma need my place, baby get your stuff
