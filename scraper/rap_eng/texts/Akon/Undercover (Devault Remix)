[Verse 1]
You know they don't wanna see us together
But it don't matter, no, 'cause I got you
Anytime you're under the weather
Babe, we can always go, if I gotta pull up on you
On the east side, in the late night, in a disguise
You know I could pull up on you, keep you all night
We could stay right, on the safe side

[Chorus]
One way or another, I'ma love you
Slidin' under covers, undercover
They don't wanna see it happen—but we say, "Fuck it"
They don't wanna see it happen—but we say, "Fuck it"
One way or another, I'ma love you
Slidin' under covers, undercover
They don't wanna see it happen—but we say, "Fuck it" (fuck 'em)
They don't wanna see it happen—but we say, "Fuck it"

[Drop]
Way
"Fuck it"
Way
"Fuck it"
Way
"Fuck it"
Way
"Fuck it"

[Verse 2]
Baby, they don't wanna see me be happy
'Cause they ain't happy, no—they don't got you
Somethin' 'bout the way we be acting
Babe, we are magical
Might just have to hit me up, on the late night
When it's game time, I don't play nice
I need you to hit me up, on my fake line
Hit that 6-9, yeah, that FaceTime

[Chorus]
One way or another, I'ma love you
Slidin' under covers, undercover
They don't wanna see it happen—but we say, "Fuck it"
They don't wanna see it happen—but we say, "Fuck it"
One way or another, I'ma love you
Slidin' under covers, undercover
They don't wanna see it happen—but we say, "Fuck it"
They don't wanna see it happen—but we say, "Fuck it"

[Drop]
"Fuck it"
"Fuck it"
"Fuck it"
"Fuck it"
Way
"Fuck it"
"Fuck it"
Way
"Fuck it"
But we say
Way
Way
Way
Way

[Chorus]
One way or another, I'ma love you
Slidin' under covers, undercover
They don't wanna see it happen—but we say, "Fuck it"
They don't wanna see it happen—but we say, "Fuck it"
One way or another, I'ma love you (way)
Slidin' under covers, undercover
They don't wanna see it happen—but we say, "Fuck it"
They don't wanna see it happen—but we say, "Fuck it"

[Outro]
Way
Way
Way
