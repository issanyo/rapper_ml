Hey-ey-ey, hey-ey-ey
Upfront.. Konvict
Hey-ey-ey, hey-ey-ey, ooh yeah

I gotta find a way to get outta here
I gotta find a way to get outta here
This ain't the way that I wanna live, no
This ain't the way, somethin gotta give
In a rush, rush - gotta keep on movin
I'm in a rush, rush - gotta keep on movin
I'm in a rush, rush - gotta keep on movin, yeah
I'm in a rush, rush - gotta keep on movin, yeah

Cause I find myself on the fast track side of life, drivin me crazy
In the hood daylight to night and you can find me grindin daily
Ay, and it ain't gon' change
As long as we gettin money keep the same mindframe
Same hood, better pop that thang
Same big whip on the block same fly dame
With my lady just rollin
With the sunshine and the wind blowin
Gotta keep my mind cleared from all this crime
Hopefully one day learn from it, but

Girl.. it's like I can't see the sun
Six in the mornin I'm still on the run
Day to the night rushin around town
Tryin to get this done 'fore the case come down
Gotta feed my fate, face to face
With no place to race except straight
I can feel them close on my heels
Gotta keep goin so I'm takin the wheel
Tryin to outrun my fears, outrun my peers
Outrun the killers and escape them years
Yet again, so I take out my pen and say
"If you find this letter please pray for me" - GEAH!

Now can you picture me growin up on the bad side of town
Where them outlaws are hangin out, all them women get down
Where cash money's the only answer to problems around
And if ya missin your people most likely they underground
This cruel world, this cruel world
Gotta leave this town forever, break away and just start o'er, ohhh
