[Hook: K Camp]
Tell me where you wanna go
Tell me what you wanna do
Baby, just be comfortable
I'll be right here next to you

[Verse 1: 50 Cent]
50, sit back, get comfortable
You tryna go shorty, we can take it there
Wrong way, get away, we can make it. Yeah
Fly higher than the jet when the bomb burnin'
Hittin in the same direction the world turnin'
Progress, regardless, we get ahead
And you know I like it when you start givin' me that
Pull up on me?, got me starin' at your legs
It's mid-day, you make a nigga wanna go to bed
A ghetto girl'll give her upper class swag
Have a Fendi monster hanging off a Kelly? Bag
I say if she want it, just get it, don't think
They should burn the money like a joker in the bank
I'll get it right back, to me it ain't a thang
Top down, feel a breeze in the fast lane
Get it on the next flip, live without limits
You a product, shit move without gimmicks

[Hook]
Tell me where you wanna go
Tell me what you wanna do
Baby, just be comfortable
I'll be right here next to you
Baby, just be comfortable
Tell me what you wanna do
Baby, just be comfortable
I'll be right here next to you

[Verse 2: K Camp]
Look, I ain't worried too much bout shawty, no
Cause I know that she be workin'
In the spare time shawty just countin' dough
We all know she's important
Let me know if you gon' ride for a fella
Me and you together super fly like propellers
I love to hold her bag and I told her about whatever
Get it while it's good cause nothing last forever

[Pre-Hook: K Camp]
G5 flight, lord oh my
Can't help to stare, every time you walk by
You got thang for a nigga I can see it in your eye
What I gotta do for a piece of tha' pie
Tell me you feelin' alright
I'm tryna' get with you tonight
I'm with the shit that you like
I'm with the shit that you like

[Hook: K Camp & (Akon)]
Tell me where you wanna go (Tell me)
Tell me what you wanna do (Ohh tell me)
Baby, just be comfortable (Be comfortable)
I'll be right here next to you (Next to you babe)

[Verse 3: Akon]
Ohh, first let me say
You lookin' gooder than a mah'fucker
Ohh, just concentrate, on this wood like a mah'fucker
Tell them fake ass niggas to give up that space cuz a real nigga want it
Matter fact, sit your ass right back cause you're mine now... and you know it
Cause I see the pain on you, do the thangs he ain't gon' do
That when he ain't come through, it's all the big picture frame on you
Spend too much time on yourself girl
(To give a fuck about a nigga) [You a bad bitch]
Won't help if you laugh girl
(Don't give a fuck about a nigga)

[Hook: K Camp & (Akon)]
Tell me where you wanna go (You wanna go)
Tell me what you wanna do (You wanna do)
Baby, just be comfortable (Comfortable)
I'll be right here next to you (Next to you)

[Bridge: K Camp]
Let's be real you know you're dealin' with a real one
Let's be real you know you're dealin' with a real one
Let's be real you know you're dealin' with a real one
Let's be real you know you're dealin' with a real one

[Verse 3: K Camp]
I ain't gotta say it all the pretty bitches want it
When I get the chance I'mma fuck you like I own it
Feel good comin' from a real nigga, don't it?
When we in the bed I just tell jump up on it
Remy all wet falling right down your spine
I ain't tryna front I just want it from behind
Hope you don't mind for the time girl you mine
Tell me one more time

[Hook]
Tell me where you wanna go
Tell me what you wanna do
Baby, just be comfortable
I'll be right here next to you
