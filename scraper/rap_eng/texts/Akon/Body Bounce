[Intro] [Kardinal talking]
Hey yo 'kon. We keep givin it to them every day my nig
We got another one? Here we go

[Verse One]
Ahhh shit here we go again
I'm lookin' at you but I'm seein' your friend
Both my hands fit around her waist
Her astronauts takin' up my space yo
I'm about to launch my rocket
Take off!
Your clothes and reach in my pocket
Grab the controller, similar to Wii
It's a game and I'mma let you beat me

[Akon]
Shawty's body's like an hourglass, that's no lie
You know if she bring it to me
The cash bout to fly, man
I'm so ready for her, I wanna throw it so fast
But I just wait to show her the blast

[Hook] [Akon]
Love the way you make that body bounce
Lovin' how you work it
Love the way you make that body bounce
Lovin' how you work it
Love the way you make that body bounce
Lovin' how you work it
I love the way you make that body bounce
Lovin' how you work it
Work it, work it

[Verse Two] [Kardinal]
Bounce, twerk
Show me a little work
I'mma take them calories off with that shirt
Look how you bouncin'
All of the sudden I think how many men try to climb that mountain
Them heels you got is no joke
Even Akon might go broke
Spendin' them ones, throwin' them twenties
I'm in love in the back throwin' up centuries
That's the body of the century
You a little insecure but baby you got plenty
Them stretch marks on your hips
Is just bungee cords bringin' you back when you dip
I read your lips, my game stay literate
I ain't scared, not a little bit
Gotta let you know
You're worth about a million ounce
Now just bounce

[Hook] [Akon]
Love the way you make that body bounce
Lovin' how you work it
Love the way you make that body bounce
Lovin' how you work it
Love the way you make that body bounce
Lovin' how you work it
I love the way you make that body bounce
Lovin' how you work it
Work it, work it

[Bridge]
Da da da da da da da da da
(I wanna see you bounce)
Da da da da da da da da da
(I wanna see you bounce)
Da da da da da da da da da
(I wanna see you bounce)
Da da da da da da da da da
(I wanna see you bounce)

[Verse Three]
Chyeaa, T.O.!
PS3, the PS stands for Pssst
If ya body bouncin' around me
Then it's game over, act like you older
Either we bouncin' right now or your dirt off the shoulder
So extra
Mr. Material
Let me feel on your birthday suit texture so resilient
I like how on the inside its like a wetsuit brilliant
Water resistant up to 9 inches
Wrap that, let me open it up like Christmas
I'm about the same height as Sidris
Keep on your heels, let's get down to business
No gym but I'm seein' your fitness
With my eyes closed you pose as a witness
Every word the body language you pronounce

[Hook] [Akon]
Love the way you make that body bounce
Lovin' how you work it
Love the way you make that body bounce
Lovin' how you work it
Love the way you make that body bounce
Lovin' how you work it
I love the way you make that body bounce
Lovin' how you work it
Work it, work it

[Akon]
Just show me how you do it baby
Just let me see
Thinkin' how you dippin' so amazing in front of me
Really into lookin' hot
Always at the body shop
Workin' on that beautiful figure

[Hook] [Akon]
Love the way you make that body bounce
Lovin' how you work it
Love the way you make that body bounce
Lovin' how you work it
Love the way you make that body bounce
Lovin' how you work it
I love the way you make that body bounce
Lovin' how you work it
Work it, work it
