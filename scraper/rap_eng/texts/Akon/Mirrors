[Verse 1]
Shut your mouth and close the door
I wanna watch you while you take it off
I'm gonna take a blindfold put it on
And then I drop the leather to the floor
I said, "shut up!"

[Chorus]
Turning the lights out, burning the candles
And the mirrors gonna fog tonight
Turning the lights out, tighten the handcuffs
And the mirrors gonna fog tonight

[Verse 2]
My stiletto on your neck
Until I tie your hands above the bed
You're 'bout to
But boy, don't pull the trigger yet
Na-na-na, I haven't reloaded the clip
Na-na-na

[Refrain]
Squeeze hard, hold that pose
You know I like it, do it
Sweetheart, I'm the boss
And when you get close to it
I'm gonna make tonight a show (oh-oh-oh)
I'll make your love grenade explode (na-na-na)

[Chorus]
Turning the lights out, burning the candles
And the mirrors gonna fog tonight
Turning the lights out, tighten the handcuffs
And the mirrors gonna fog tonight
Turning the lights out, burning the candles
And the mirrors gonna fog tonight
Turning the lights out, tighten the handcuffs
And the mirrors gonna fog tonight

[Bridge]
Sex, love, control, vanity
Sex, love, control, vanity
Sex, love, control, vanity (and the mirrors gonna fog tonight)
Sex, love, control, vanity (and the mirrors gonna fog tonight)
Sex, love, control, vanity (and the mirrors gonna fog tonight)
Sex, love, control, vanity (the mirrors gonna fog tonight)
Vanity, vanity

[Refrain]
Squeeze hard, hold that pose
You know I like it, do it
Sweetheart, I'm the boss
And when you get close to it
I'm gonna make tonight a show (oh-oh-oh)
I'll make your love grenade explode (na-na-na)

[Chorus]
Turning the lights out, burning the candles
And the mirrors gonna fog tonight
Turning the lights out, tighten the handcuffs
And the mirrors gonna fog tonight
Turning the lights out, burning the candles
And the mirrors gonna fog tonight
Turning the lights out, tighten the handcuffs
And the mirrors gonna fog tonight

[Outro]
And the mirrors gonna fog tonight
And the mirrors gonna fog tonight
