Ok...Akon stay out of trouble now son
Akon... stay out of trouble now son

Let me tell you what hurts the most
I'm a convicted felon and I can't work
No matter where I go I try to get paid
They never give me the job cuz they are afraid that
I'm a stick em up oh yea stick it
Rob the manager and everybody in it
Thats the everyday life of a convict tryin to make it
Why they sayin to me

[Hook: X2]
The judges said don't trouble nobody
Probation said don't trouble nobody
Stay out of trouble, don't trouble nobody
And I'm a try not to trouble nobody

Me and my niggas on the block all day clockin dimes
Lookin out for police
Cause this the type of shit that we go through
Up in the ghetto jus to make some cheese
Street life got me gettin locked up about 5, 6 times a week
And then a made bond, take it from the profit of the weed
All this just to feed my seeds, yeah

[Hook]
I got a stop this livin, I witness one to many killings
I've seen the hardenst niggas straight propped up
And a pound that's never ever been found so..

[Hook: X2]

I'm tryin to stay away from trouble everyday
But its hard when the things you need
Picture lookin at your babies in the face
When they hungry and they need to eat

[Hook]
Tryin not to do wrong
But they won't let me do right
Even though I done changed my life
Criminal records what they judgen me by
That's why..

[Hook]
Momma said don't trouble nobody
Papa said don't trouble nobody
Stay out of trouble don't trouble nobody
And I'm a try not to trouble nobody

[Hook]
Momma said don't trouble nobody
Papa said don't trouble nobody
Stay out of trouble don't trouble nobody
And I'm a try not to trouble nobody
