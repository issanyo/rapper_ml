Steve:

See I know and you know that we ready
Let's go while I roll in my Chevy
Well I can see you wanna break me
And I can feel you wanna bring me down
First you gotta make me
Won't be easy coming in my town
Cause everybody in my city wanna be number one
They'll be only one that's standing at the end of this run 'cause

We ready
We ready
We ready
We ready

Because I'm a Champion
And I move like a Champion
Whoever will be a Champion
Born to be a Champion

Piper:

Ain't nobody that can stop me
I'm seeing this shit through
If I want it I'ma get it
There's nothing I won't do
Man my focus is ridiculous
Strategy so meticulous
Relentless if I'm comin to get it
You best move to the side
Math the Piper don't hesitate
He just ride
Heart of a lion with the fire in my eyes
Push it until it shuts down
I'm the last man standin
With cannon like what now
And I'm on it
They should've never let us in
Payback and revenge
It's the beginning of the end
Yousa gonner
And as sure as the sun sets
If we ain't won yet, then we ain't done yet

We ready
We ready
We ready
We ready

Because I'm a Champion
And I move like a Champion
Whoever will be a Champion
Born to be a Champion

Chantelle:

Yes I know and you know
That we'll win it so let's sweat it
Let's press it till we get
Till we get it
Cause we're defying gravity
We're going up and never coming down
Our team is ready
They cannot beat us till we're in the ground no

Cause everybody in my city wanna be number one
They'll be only one that's standing at the end of this run
'Cause

We ready
We ready
We ready
We ready

Because I'm a Champion
And I move like a Champion
Whoever will be a Champion
Born to be a Champion

We ready
We ready
We ready
We ready

Because I'm a Champion
And I move like a Champion
Whoever will be a Champion
Born to be a Champion
