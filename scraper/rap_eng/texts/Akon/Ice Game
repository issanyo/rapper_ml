[Intro: Young Scooter]
Look at my ice game
These real diamonds in my diamond chain
Haha, fake ass jewelry nigga

[Hook: Young Scooter]
Ice game, ice game
VS1’s in my diamond chain
Ice game, ice game
Spent a half a million dollars on my ice game
I see your jewelry ain’t shining
Lighthouse, real diamonds
I be flexing with my ice game
You lose your life, you reach out for my fucking chain

[Verse 1: Young Scooter]
You know my diamonds, they’ll spook a bitch
Shout out to Spook, my partner Lil Rich
We was young niggas sellin’ bricks
He was selling clean and I was selling bullshit
I’m always flexing with my diamond chain
You got fake diamonds, switch up your ice game
Look at my watch and my diamond ring
Lighthouse nigga, bling bling

[Hook: Young Scooter]
Ice game, ice game
VS1’s in my diamond chain
Ice game, ice game
Spent a half a million dollars on my ice game
I see your jewelry ain’t shining
Lighthouse, real diamonds
I be flexing with my ice game
You lose your life, you reach out for my fucking chain

[Verse 2: Akon]
I’m rocking chains like I’m King Tut
Diamonds hang to my left nut
Honestly I don’t give a fuck
Got ice right now in the Brink’s truck
Yeah nigga, sure you heard
Diamond mines in Johannesburg
Top connection in Angola
And Akon is your password
Black as hell so we shine bright
And that’s why I stay in all white
VVS’s so disrespectful
Run up on me and lose your life
I’m watching these rappers
Watching them rack all that fugazi jewelry
Got a whole lot of bitches
Only one I care about is my TIffany
Y’all niggas ain’t foolin’ me
Cubic [?] all in your jewelry
Nigga stop rocking that foolery
Before I come pull up artillery

[Hook: Young Scooter]
Ice game, ice game
VS1’s in my diamond chain
Ice game, ice game
Spent a half a million dollars on my ice game
I see your jewelry ain’t shining
Lighthouse, real diamonds
I be flexing with my ice game
You lose your life, you reach out for my fucking chain

[Verse 3: Young Scooter]
They call Atlanta Black Hollywood
Jugged out white in Weezy’s spot, ducked off in Lakewood
But that’s before this rap game
Look at me now, I own twenty chains
Yeah these real diamonds
You know I got this shit from grinding
Please take off them fake chains
Throw diamonds in the pot, cool off the cocaine

[Hook: Young Scooter]
Ice game, ice game
VS1’s in my diamond chain
Ice game, ice game
Spent a half a million dollars on my ice game
I see your jewelry ain’t shining
Lighthouse, real diamonds
I be flexing with my ice game
You lose your life, you reach out for my fucking chain
