[Chorus Akon]
When the party's over
And the lights cool down
When everybody go
I'm hoping that you stick around
When the high is over
And we sober down
When everybody go
I'm hoping that you stick around

[Verse 1 Akon]
I know we just met
I know we just started
But there's something here
I can tell we got it
We like a classic song
I been singing all night long
And it goes like

[Pre-Chorus Akon]
Oh my love
My darling
When we sober up
Will you still be mine?

[Chorus Akon & Matoma]
When the party's over
And the lights cool down
When everybody go
I'm hoping that you stick around
When the high is over
And we sober down
When everybody go
I'm hoping that you stick around
When the party's over
And the lights cool down
When everybody go
I'm hoping that you stick around, stick around
When the high is over
And we sober down
When everybody go
I'm hoping that you stick around

[Verse 2 Akon & Matoma]
I know we just met
I know we just started
But there's something here
I can tell we got it
We like a classic song
I been singing all night long
And it goes like

[Pre-Chorus Akon]
Oh my love
My darling
When we sober up
Will you still be mine?

[Chorus Akon & Matoma]
When the party's over
And the lights cool down
When everybody go
I'm hoping that you stick around
When the high is over
And we sober down
When everybody go
I'm hoping that you stick around

[Bridge Akon & Matoma]
So please stay over (stay over)
Take care of you through your hangover
Let's make love through the moonlight until the daylight
And then we both think back like: what a night
Let you decide, alright

[Chorus Akon & Matoma]
When the party's over
And the lights cool down
When everybody go
I'm hoping that you stick around
When the high is over
And we sober down
When everybody go
I'm hoping that you stick around

[Outro Akon]
The party's over
The lights cool down
Hoping that you stick around
Oh sober down
Hoping that you stick around
