[Hook: Akon]
Oh, don't even look at me wrong when I come through the hood
Ain't nuttin change still holla at my homies (Like Sean More, RaDaKiS, Reece)
Ohh and when I hit the block I still will kill (RossWeLoveRoss, Jason Chu)
And I don't want to, nigga but I will if I got to (Jakil3, Cammy, William, Mik Milne)
Kill, if niggas get to fucking around
If niggas get to fucking around

[Verse 1]
PuKe King ain't mewling, I'm puking, I'm spewing
A list of Bill's words, yeah, uh huh, lets do it
The game's a-foot, like I cut your fucking ankle off
And shoved it in my PS2 to use it like an analogue
You're pussying out now, what the fuck you shatting for?
See Sick's right all the time, like tides, tell me, am I wrong?
And I don't skim milk, yeah I skim mixtapes
And I don't hear skills, so yeah I still skip fakes
And I'm just being real, when I say what Sick plays
Cos I'm fucking ill, like my man RaDaKiS says
Plus I'm awful hectic when I smash the mic
And you are epileptic when I flash the lights
I'mma make you understand me now homes
Til I'm familiar in your mouth like my name was household
I'm grown, old too bold for this shit
I'mma make you understand me with your wrists slit, bitches

[Verse 2]
Any prick dissing Sick, gets beat with fists like discipline
My lyrics hit with swiftness just tailored for your listening
I'm sticking in, I'm sickening, I'm thinking I've gone crazy
Cos this Atmosphere is actual weird cos I never shone daily haha
Slug, they don't get me when I speak
Call me Spock as I prosper, fuck it, call me God freak
I'mma make your God be, humble as pie
Do not preach your rhetoric where Sick closes eyes
See, I used to over-think, now I'm over thinking
Used to think drinking's cool, but now I'm sober drinking
You can't take it all but the kitchen sink I'm taking it
Having cheese cut don't teach you what real greatness is
Famous, you ain't lived enough to claim it yet
I'll fuck you face so hard, I'll earn the title rapist
Or rapper, fuck it, I'll wrap your knuckles with my fist
Fucking glory hole, you don't know who you're fucking with
