[Verse 1: B.o.B.]
Ask her, I make a nigga spend cash
I make a nigga make rational decisions in a flash
She started out catching cabs
Now she got keys to your pad
Be smarter now
You been tryin’ to wife her up and all the while
She decided to start freakin the whole party out
Said she on a spa day really she at my place
She was steady calling she just put her phone on vibrate
Damn! You thought she was all yours
She just want a baller or a NBA Power Forward
The hip hop awards she in town for
And for a nigga like me she in line for
You see the biggest mistake you can make
Is to chase a pretty face with a shape
And create fantasies that are fake
It’s even harder if you do believe in fate
A heart always turns cold when it breaks

[Hook: Akon]
Gotta let this go and fade away
When you let me go
You made the biggest mistake
The biggest mistake
When you let me go
You made the biggest mistake

[Verse 2: Daniel Martiniano]
Never wanted to be that guy
Got me all caught up in a million lies
How was I supposed to know
Shoulda told you way back then
Guess I never thought I’d see you again
You made me crash and burn
The sky is above me I’m high as a bird
If you never love me then why use the word
You know what it looks like
You’ve done this before
I won’t let you fool me...

[Hook]
