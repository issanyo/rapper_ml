Convict, up front
Akon, Slim Shady
I see the one
Could she be that lady

I feel you creepin', I can see you from my shadow
Wanna jump up in my Lamborghini Gallardo
Maybe go to my place and just kick it, like Taebo
And possibly bend you over

Look back and watch me (Smack that), all on the floor
Smack that, give me some more
Smack that, 'till you get sore
Smack that, ohohohohoho

Smack that, all on the floor
Smack that, give me some more
Smack that, 'till you get sore
Smack that, ohohohohoho

Up front style, ready to attack now
Pull in the parking lot slow with the lack down
Convicts got the whole thing packed down
Step in the club, the wardrobe intact now

(I feel it) Go on and crack now
(Oh, I see it) Don't let back now
(I'm-a call her) Then I put the mack down
(Money? No problem) Pocket full of that now

I feel you creepin', I can see you from my shadow
Wanna jump up in my Lamborghini Gallardo
Maybe go to my place and just kick it, like Taebo
And possibly bend you over

Look back and watch me (Smack that), all on the floor
Smack that, give me some more
Smack that, 'till you get sore
Smack that, ohohohohoho

Smack that, all on the floor
Smack that, give me some more
Smack that, 'till you get sore
Smack that, ohohohohoho

Oh, looks like another club banger
They better hang on when I throw this thang on
Get a little drink on, they goin' flip
For this Akon shit, you can bank on it

Pedicure, manicure, kitty cat claws
The way she climbs up and down them poles
Lookin' like one of them Pretty Cat Dolls
Try'na hold my woody back through my drawers

Steps off stage, didn't think I saw her
Creeps up behind me and she's like, you're
I'm like, yeah, I know, let's cut to the chase
No time to waste, back to my place

Plus from the club to the crib's like a mile away
Or more like a palace, shall I say
And plus I got a pal, every gal is game
In fact he's the one singing the song that's playing! (Akon!)

I feel you creepin', I can see you from my shadow
Wanna jump up in my Lamborghini Gallardo
Maybe go to my place and just kick it, like Taebo
And possibly bend you over

Look back and watch me (Smack that), all on the floor
Smack that, give me some more
Smack that, 'till you get sore
Smack that, ohohohohoho

Smack that, all on the floor
Smack that, give me some more
Smack that, 'till you get sore
Smack that, ohohohohoho

Eminem's rollin', D an' them rollin'
Boo an' Oh Marvelous an' them rollin'
Women just hoin', big booty rollin'
Soon I be all in them an' throwin' D

Hittin' no less than three
Block will style like wee, wee
Girl, I can tell you want me, 'cause lately

I feel you creepin', I can see you from my shadow
Wanna jump up in my Lamborghini Gallardo
Maybe go to my place and just kick it, like Taebo
And possibly bend you over

Look back and watch me (Smack that), all on the floor
Smack that, give me some more
Smack that, 'till you get sore
Smack that, ohohohohoho

Smack that, all on the floor
Smack that, give me some more
Smack that, 'till you get sore
Smack that, ohohohohoho
