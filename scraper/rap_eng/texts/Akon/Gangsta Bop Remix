[Intro: Akon]
Ayo, it's the illegal alien, man
To make a long story short
This how we get down
It's me and DJ Skee right here
Lets get it crackin'!
Go gangsta, keep boppin'
Rock wit me lets keep this bitch poppin'
Go gangsta, keep boppin'
Like back when a nigga was clockin'

[Verse 1: Game]
Guess who's back?
In the 6-4 Impala with the gold D's on it
15's in the trunk, let it bump
Soon as Akon breathe on it the club get crunk
Swallow the snare, inhale the bass and watch the club jump
Everybody getting drunk and it's all on me
You 21? Let me see I.D
That ain't you, get out the V.I.P
I'm rap's M.V.P., toasting up for Pac and B.I.G
Smoke somethin...

[Hook: Akon]
I don't know you, you don't know me
You don't know the history I got on these streets
Only if you see what my eyes have seen
Then you'll understand why I'm surrounded by G's
If you owe me, or we got beef
I recommend you reach for your heat and don't freeze
Pause for a minute guaranteed you gon' bleed
Cause that's how we was raised growing up in these streets

Go gangsta, keep boppin'
Rock wit me lets keep this bitch poppin'
Go gangsta, keep boppin'
Like back when a nigga was clockin'

[Verse 2: Game]
When I say "bounce," everybody in the club gon' bounce
All the homies put your rags in the air
All the ladies put your drinks in the air
Light it up, take a puff
Grab a cup, fill it up
Throw Patron shots back til you dizzy and your head bust
Mix the silver with lime and call it a head rush
Meet me in the V.I.P., we on some gangsta shit
Every time you see Akon he on some gangsta shit
Ridin' wit me, it'll be a gang of half-naked chicks in the club
Imported from South France
Got em throwing up dubs
Drinking outta champagne fountains blowing on dubs
Cristal mixed with Chronic now they throwing up bras
Look at em rocking all that ice tryna glow in the club
I make em strip like a chick 'fore she get in that tub
I'm getting tired of these fake ass thugs
In these fake ass clubs
Running up, Akon pass me the snub

[Hook: Akon]
