[Hook:Akon]
Hey girl I see you standing next to him
And i can tell you ain't happy
You rather be on the side of the club
Ballin out with a nigga like me
I can see you imagining those thoughts in your head
By the way your staring
Ill help your fantasies come true
All you gotta do is look me in my eyes
Look me in my eyes
Look me in my eyes
Look me in my eyes
Ill take you to that place all i ask is look me in my eyes
Look me in my eyes

[Verse 1:Blast]
What it do mama they call me young Blast
And I couldn't help but stop as soon as I rolled pass ya
I seen your pretty face you ain't supposed to frown
Who needs your man anyway imma hold you down
And I ain't dont brag but he ain't fly like me
He ain't on by your side ride like me
Now look around ain't no guys like me
You can look into my eyes and see

Im all the things that your man can't be
Down to do it all fulfill your fantasies
I need a freak that'll late night creep
Hop up in the coop then we cruise through the streets
Ride to the tele then straight to the suites
Turn the lights low and then straight to the sheets
Your man buggin you dont need that mess
All I need is one night let me ease that stress
He running game ma I ain't gotta lie to you
Akon sing the hook tell her what she gotta do

Look me in my eyes

We'll take it to that place where we can escape alone
So turn off the side kick two razer phones
So whats it gonna be its either him or me
When your ready shorty I'll be in the VIP

Chunk at him deuce tell him that your rollin with Blast
