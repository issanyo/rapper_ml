(feat. Team Invasion)

This Goes Out To Them Clowns
Talkin Bout They Got The Block Locked Down
Sewin Up The Compound
Only U If Knew How My Squad Get Down
You Think You Met A Bad Man Walkin
You Ain't Met A Bad Man Till You Walked Up On Me
Hit You With The Glock 2 Times
Fuckin Up My Show Shoe Shine
Once You Drop Down
See Niggas Ain't Got No Dough
Fakin Like They Wanna Be Loco
I See You Jakin My Jewels
I Ain't The One You Want To Stand Next To
You Think You Met A Bad Man Walkin
You Ain't Met A Bad Man Till You Walked Up On Me
Its An Invasion
Dont Give A Fuck Black Red Caucasian

Yo Yo Between U And I
Theres A Truth No Lie
You Gon Die 4 The Fact That Hood Rules Apply
I Hold My Ruger High
B4 I Shoot The Sky
Shoot Your Alla Shoot Your Father
Haze Got Me Super High
My Team Movin Pies
My Team Move And Rise
Clutchin On 45s
Fuck With Us Its Suicide
Cuz U Get Crucified
Green Got Us Flyin G-Fulls
Commercial Time We Use To Fly
I Dare U To Try
To Test The Evil Genius
We Got A Crew And I
We A Bunch Of Trigger Squeezers
They Call Us Nigga Bleeders
We Make Niggas Bleed
We Can't Get At You
Shit We Kidnap Your Seed
And Thats A Hood Rule
So Beef In My Streets
With My Heat
Ain't No Tellin What I Could Do
Who Write The Crook Rules
This Is For The Mixtapes In The Streets
Nigga Makin Shook Moves

I Ain't Gonna Tell You No Lie
See Them Hood Rules Do Apply
'F You Choose Not To Abide
Guarantee Youll See A Grown Man Cry
You Think You Met A Bad Man Walkin
You Ain't Met A Bad Man Till You Walked Up On Me
U Think You Been Slidin
Way More Grief Than The Nigga Bin Laden
Cuz We On The Block All Day
Some Crooks Some Movin That Ye
Gotta Get That Pay
Stick Up Kids Tryin To Stomp That Brake
You Think Seen A Bad Man Walkin
You Ain't Met A Bad Man Till You Walked Up On Me
Keep A Double Loose On Here
You Dont Do That Dance
Keep It Under That Sand

I Got My Nose In The Hood Like Coke On The Table
Go Against My Rule Get A Slug In Your Naval
Even My Brother Can Get It True Like Can Enable
Times Are Hard And The Rich Still Do
So By Any Means Nigga Your Ass Is Expendable
Hoes Ain't A Friend To Me Theyre Just My Enemy
I Only Got Love For Dollar Bills And Hennesse
Most Niggas Ain't Worthy Of A Slug Or Knife
So I Pistol Whip Them Dudes The Blunt Trauma
With The Chrome Laama
I Learnt A Lot From The Mo' Dramas
The Game Of Life Is More Like Blood-Sport
Thats Why A Lotta Niggas Gon Died On The Court
Rule 73 Keep Your Gun Oily Clean
Just To Be The Last Man Standin At The Crime Scene
Heart Beatin Crazy Cold Sweatin Cuz U Made It
Now Make Ya Escape With The Toast And The Cake

You Met A Bad Man Walkin
You Ain't Met A Bad Man Till You Walked Up On Me
Its An Invasion
Dont Give A Fuck Black Red Caucasian
