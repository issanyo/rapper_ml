(Oh, oh)
People are watching
But we don't care, the way I am touching your body
Cause we don't care, see you droppin' and poppin'
Like we don't care, makes me want to keep grinding
Like we don't care

(Oh, oh)
See I'm getting nasty with you on the dance floor
You got me going
(Oh, oh)
Could you be the reason why I'm losing control?
Fo sho, like we don't care

See I met her at club on the Friday
Big booty, small waist
Seeing her coming my way
So I had to bag her, I really had to have her
Oh

I didn't see a ring on her finger
Asked her have you ever been with a singer before?
She said no
Oh

So let me introduce you to my world
Big diamonds and pearls all a part of being my girl
I got that type of *shit* that you ain't never seen before
It's all around the world, I got them coming back for more

That's when I noticed people are watching
But we don't care, the way I am touching your body
Cause we don't care, see you droppin' and poppin'
Like we don't care, makes me want to keep grinding
Like we don't care

(Oh, oh)
See I'm getting nasty with you on the dance floor
You got me going
(Oh, oh)
Could you be the reason why I'm losing control?
Fo sho, like we don't care

Got shorty right where I want her
Strapped up, hemmed up, trapped in the corner
Grinding slow and I won't let go
No, no

Baby, more iller than ammonia
Feeling tipsy from a bottle of Corona
Oh, no
I feel she bout to let go
Oh, oh

She said she wants to bring me to her world
She whispers some words that damn near made my toes curl
She said she's got that *shit* that I have never seen before
And if I get a taste I'll be coming right back for more

And that's when I noticed people are watching
But we don't care, the way I am touching your body
Cause we don't care, see you droppin' and poppin'
Like we don't care, makes me want to keep grinding
Like we don't care

(Oh, oh)
See I'm getting nasty with you on the dance floor
You got me going
(Oh, oh)
Could you be the reason why I'm losing control?
Fo sho, like we don't care

We dancing together like we belong in my bedroom
(In and out the sheets, what we doin' it on the dancefloor
If we share mattresses you leave me no headroom
(Loose as one can be and she's flaunting it, damn it's hardcore)

People are watching
But we don't care, the way I am touching your body
Cause we don't care, see you droppin' and poppin'
Like we don't care, makes me want to keep grinding
Like we don't care

(Oh, oh)
See I'm getting nasty with you on the dance floor
You got me going
(Oh, oh)
Could you be the reason why I'm losing control?
Fo sho, like we don't care

Fo sho, like we don't care
Fo sho, like we don't care
Fo sho, like we don't care
