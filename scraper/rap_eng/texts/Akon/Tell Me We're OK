[Verse 1]
Tell me what you feel
Don't tell me it's nothing
It's gotta be something
You still want from me
Tell me what you hear
If my words mean nothing
Wish they would say something
Something that would heal

[Pre-Chorus]
But I'm out of my mind
And you know it, know it, know it
I show it, show it, show it
And I'm running out of time
I know it, know it, know it
You show it, show it, show it

[Chorus]
Just tell me that we're okay
There's something left to say
Just tell me we're okay
Just tell me that we're okay
If there's something left to say
Just tell me we're okay

[Verse 2]
Tell me through your tears
That this don't change nothing
And we still mean something
'Cause some things are real
Tell me that you know
That I would be nothing
But we could be something for all our years

[Pre-Chorus]
But I'm out of my mind
And you know it, know it, know it
I show it, show it, show it
And I'm running out of time
I know it, know it, know it
You show it, show it, show it

[Chorus]
Just tell me that we're okay
There's nothing left to say
Just tell me we're okay (We are okay)
Just tell me that we're okay
(That's all I need to hear, baby)
That we're gonna make it (Oh, we're gonna make it)
Tell me we're okay (Just tell me we're okay)
If there's something left to say
Just tell me we're okay

[Outro]
Tell me that
Tell me that, tell me we're okay
