[Intro]
It'd be so nice if you didn't have to feel so lonely
It'd be so nice if I could sneak you for a moment

[Verse 1]
I know you like to get away, go away far away
To a place where there's just us two
Got a busy day everyday but not today
'Cause I'm here to take that stress from you

[Chorus 1: Lionel]
So you can just chill and clear your head
And let me do everything for you 'cause you deserve it
Prepare your meal and make your bed
Well, let just first make this with you 'cause you are so worth it

[Chorus 2: Akon]
I just want us to go, go, go
Drop everything and just go, go, go
I just want us to go, go, go
Drop everything and just go, go, go

[Verse 2]
How would you like to sail away in the Bahamas?
Just you and me, girl
So far out in the sea where nobody can find us
Just the end of the world
'Cause there is no rush
For you to come back and face the rain
'Cause there is plenty sunshine where I'm taking you
And I'm here to reduce the pain
I know you like to get away, go away, far away
To a place where there's just us two
Got a busy day everyday but not today
'Cause I'm here to take that stress from you

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 2]

[Bridge]
Just imagine when you tired and laying by my side and
Sipping on some wine while I stand and massage and
Releasing all your tension I couldn't handle the time and
And my job is to keep my baby smiling

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 2] [x2]
