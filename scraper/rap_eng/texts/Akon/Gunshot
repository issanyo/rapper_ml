Have you ever spent one day on my block?
Had to make good with crooked ass cops
Witness innocent by-standers get shot
Made a living ready or not (We)
(To stay true!!!) To all my niggas
Things getting hard but we still grinding up
(To stay true!!!) To all my niggas
Still don't came up and cops cribs by the river
Men we imported export keys
Before the feds came down on we
True bad man no counterfeit g's
Maybe wanna stick around and trust you will see (That)
