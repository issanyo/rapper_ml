[Intro: Akon]
Keys to my, to my...
Keys to me start...

[Verse 1: Akon]
She’s the keys to my starter in my automatic car
Yeah she make me wanna go harder and she always lift the bar
When she keep that spotlight glowing cause she is a superstar
Everybody know this is girl when she step up in the place whether near or far

[Chorus: Akon]
The way she crank it up
The way she crank it up
The way she crank it up
The way she cranks it up
The way she crank it up
The way she crank it up
The way she crank it up
The way she cranks it up

[Post-Chorus: Akon]
She might not be the one you see in a magazine
She might not be the one you fantasize in your dream
She’s the only girl left in the world that can guarantee what you need tonight

[Verse 2: Akon]
With my G's and we riding in a magnificent car
And we rollin' with the baddest chicks and you won’t see a flaw
Booty riding up so perfect, badder than my Audemars
And I pound it up so perfect it'll hit her 'til tomorrow

[Chorus: Akon]
Watch her crank it up
The way she crank it up
The way she crank it up
The way she cranks it up
The way she crank it up
The way she crank it up
The way she crank it up
The way she cranks it up

[Post-Chorus: Akon]
She might not be the one you see in a magazine
She might not be the one you fantasize in your dream
She’s the only girl left in the world that can guarantee what you need tonight

[Refrain: Akon]
With my G's and we riding in a magnificent car
And we rollin' with the baddest chicks and you won’t see a flaw
Booty riding up so perfect, badder than my Audemars
And I pound it up so perfect it'll hit her 'til tomorrow

[Chorus: Akon]
The way she crank it up
The way she crank it up
The way she crank it up
The way she cranks it up
The way she crank it up
The way she crank it up
The way she crank it up
The way she cranks it up

[Bridge: Akon]
She’s trying to make me fall in love again, yeah
The way she moving I can tell you she’s almost there, yeah

[Post-Chorus: Akon]
She might not be the one you see in a magazine
She might not be the one you fantasize in your dream
She’s the only girl left in the world that can guarantee what you need tonight

[Chorus: Akon]
The way she crank it up
The way she crank it up
The way she crank it up
The way she cranks it up
The way she crank it up
The way she crank it up
The way she crank it up
The way she cranks it up
