[Verse 1]
I'm sittin' on my porch, watching the law
As they ride past in they patrol cars
So tell me why I feel like the enemy
They're supposed to be here protectin' me
I might have went too far
Helping to contribute to making they job hard
Serving fiends like these people ain't no enemy
I can't believe I'm out here killing my community
If you knew how far I came (far I came)
From where I am and where I used to be (where I used to be)
Don't want it, you can tell by the look at me
This gangsta life ain't no longer in me

[Hook]
And I'm tired of the runnin', tired of the runnin'
Tired of the runnin', runnin' from the law
Baby, you gotta believe me
Said I'm tired of the runnin', tired of the runnin'
Tired of the runnin', runnin' from the law
Baby, you gotta believe me

[Verse 2]
I know there's things I could've changed, girl
I know there's things I could've done a lot better
Instead I'm in the streets tryin' to make that cheddar
Thinking in my mind that you gon' be there forever
I know I could've let it all go (let it all go)
But I was thinking it would make life better
Instead I'm sittin' in this cell, writing this letter
Thought I wouldn't get caught ‘cause I was way too clever
I learned there's no one to catch you when you're fallin'
And they'll be no one to hear you when you're callin'
Do you know what it's like to wake up in the mornin'
While you're starvin' and you're hearing bugs crawlin'?
Reminiscing on them days you was walkin'
With pretty women on your arm while you're flossin'
Thankful that I didn't end up in a coffin
Something you see too often

[Hook – x2]
And I'm tired of the runnin', tired of the runnin'
Tired of the runnin', runnin' from the law
Baby, you gotta believe me
Said I'm tired of the runnin', tired of the runnin'
Tired of the runnin', runnin' from the law
Baby, you gotta believe me
