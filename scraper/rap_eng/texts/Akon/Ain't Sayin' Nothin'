Real niggas recognize real
Know you heard it before, I seen the blood spill
Cause in the hood, niggas dumpin'
And when they askin' questions then you ain't sayin' nothin'

It never left, I just had to chill
Me and fifty one hundred niggas that will still kill
Them snakes in the grass, tryna police niggas
Say I'm livin' too large, I'm obese nigga
Eight hundred million and I cashed out
You ain't got it by now, well then you assed out
I read the blueprint, and then I ran with it
Gave it to Boo, he went and built his brand with it

Real niggas recognize real
Know you heard it before, I seen the blood spill
Cause in the hood, niggas dumpin'
And when they askin' questions then you ain't sayin' nothin'

In position of power, so now they hear me
May not admit it, but I know these niggas fear me
Every year I grind harder than the last one
Life's short, you never know when it's your last one
Black as fuck, my girl Yellow calls us her dealers
Keep it a hundred when niggas in high can kill us
You wanna hustle, just know I supply the dealer
How you live in the jungle and you ain't a gorilla, yeah

Real niggas recognize real
Know you heard it before, I seen the blood spill
Cause in the hood, niggas dumpin'
And when they askin' questions then you ain't sayin' nothin'
