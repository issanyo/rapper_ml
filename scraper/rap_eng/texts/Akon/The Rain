[Akon]
The pressure's buildin up (oh) I feel like givin up (oh)
How in the fuck am I gonna back my first album up?
Well everything has changed (oh) it'll never be the same (oh)
Nobody knew me then, now everybody knows my name
... and I feel so ashamed
I never been the kind of nigga that would complain (complain)
But it's so crazy man
It's no different, every day it's just the same thing
Now it's been months out on the road
On tour doin so many different shows
Head spinnin feelin like it's gonna explode
And I just wanna know
If anybody out there's feelin me
I'm losin my mind and I can't believe
I let this shit get the best of me
And now I gotta let ya know

[Hook: Akon]
What's got me insane?
Ohh, cause I can't stand the rain
Ayy, it's hitting my window pane, a little too much
And now I gotta let ya know
What's got my face in a frown?
Ayy, cause I can't stand the sound
Ohh, the thunder that's crashing down, upon my house
Ay, cause now I gotta let ya know

[Akon]
Now I got, no more worries now (now) my pocket's fatter now (now)
Look in the mirror, my reflection looks different now
You're gettin bigger Akon you need to settle down
Why do I feel this way?
Should I be happy or, should I just ignore
Everything that I've been given, please help me Lord (please help me Lord)
It's all over but - I can't escape the raaaaain
Now it's been months out on the road
On tour doin so many different shows
Head spinnin feelin like it's gonna explode
And now I gotta let you know
If anybody out there's feelin me
I'm losin my mind and I can't believe
I let this shit get the best of me
And now I gotta let ya know
