[Hook]
I've tried so hard, I can't seem to get away from misery
Man I've tried so hard but will always be a victim of these streets
It ain't my fault cause I try to get away but trouble follows me
And still I try so hard hoping one day you'll come and rescue me
But until then I'll be posted up right here rain sleet hail snow
But until then I'll be posted up right here with my heat gettin' dough

[Verse 1]
I tried so hard and I'm feeling like I'm lost now
My minds getting tossed around
I'm trying to escape now but don't know where to run to
Or who to turn to, what am I to do
The stress is getting me, uni and family, and love, yeah it's been affecting me
My thoughts are clouded with mystery
I play basketball or rap to try and think a bit more clearly
One night I was dreaming, catching some Zzz's and, I started falling, and woke up screaming
Now I'm walking through a maze tryna find myself, and yet, there were no signs of help

[Hook]
I've tried so hard, I can't seem to get away from misery
Man I've tried so hard but will always be a victim of these streets
It ain't my fault cause I try to get away but trouble follows me
And still I try so hard hoping one day you'll come and rescue me
But until then I'll be posted up right here rain sleet hail snow
But until then I'll be posted up right here with my heat gettin' dough

[Verse 2]
Lately I been feeling non-existent
Friends and family have become distant and I miss 'em
The girls I used to love hardly speak to me
It's like they don't wanna hear a peep from me
My heart feels like it's weakening
It keeps on breaking and there's just no reasoning
I can deal some relationships aren't meant to be
But I miss every second you both spent with me
S'pose you both don't care enough, and I suppose I care too much
It's not just both of you it's my family too
On my own like an alien race
I'll try to escape fate while me and Pac pray for Better Dayz

[Hook]
I've tried so hard, I can't seem to get away from misery
Man I've tried so hard but will always be a victim of these streets
It ain't my fault cause I try to get away but trouble follows me
And still I try so hard hoping one day you'll come and rescue me
But until then I'll be posted up right here rain sleet hail snow
But until then I'll be posted up right here with my heat gettin' dough

[Verse 3]
Yeah I've had a broken heart or two
And yeah I've walked out the house a time or two
Maybe a time or two too many but, who else could possibly know my story better than you
You know who you are I shouldn't have to tell you
I hope we can get back to, being friends and you could help me through
The shit I'm going through, you know that I'm here for you, if you need me to
It's got me down, tell me what to do
You know how my mum and I don't get along
I only act strong, but I still persist and fight on
Is it so wrong that I tried to mend this broken bond, guess I just tried too hard, for too long

[Hook]
I've tried so hard, I can't seem to get away from misery
Man I've tried so hard but will always be a victim of these streets
It ain't my fault cause I try to get away but trouble follows me
And still I try so hard hoping one day you'll come and rescue me
But until then I'll be posted up right here rain sleet hail snow
But until then I'll be posted up right here with my heat gettin' dough
