[Verse 1]
I walk the land and released all the weight on my shoulders
And I sailed the seas and watched all of my dreams come true
I flew the sky and seen everything from a bird's view
And I rode the streets and reality brought me back to you

[Chorus 1]
That's when I realized that we got to be alive
Yeah and party like there's nothing left to give

[Chorus 2] [x2]
Yeah, it's nothing, yeah, there's nothing
Yeah, party like there's nothing left to give

[Verse 2]
Can you imagine going through life so crazy?
So busy, don't have time to be with your baby
Need to go out and enjoy this nightlife to save me
I been feeling oh so good about how things going lately

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 2] [x4]

[Chorus 3] [x2]
People to the left hey, people to the right hey
If you want to do some things in life just know it's going to be alright

[Chorus 4] [x2]
So can you give it all to me, so can you give it all to me
Want to feel your energy, oh yeah, want to see you rock with me, oh yeah

[Chorus 2] [x2]

[Outro]
Party like there's nothing left to give
