I've been writing you this letter
I wanna say boy that I love you so
They just don't know
Even though they try to tell me forget about you
'Cause you locked away

And baby ill wait ten thousand days
Whatever it takes
To see your face
Where ever you are
No matter how far
Can't tear us apart
You got my heart

I wanna do this
Never leave you no

And I can't even for a minute imagine my life
Without you in my world
And baby ill wait ten thousand days
Whatever it takes

Missing you so bad

Why did you have to leave?
So hard when you're away from me
But I'm your girl
And I know that ill see you soon
Boy I'm counting down the days
Just to be with you
No matter where you are
They can't break us apart
You know you'll always have my heart
