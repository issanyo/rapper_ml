[Intro : Akon]
Im steady tryin' to find a motive
Why do what i do?
Freedom ain't gettin no closer
No matter how far i go
My car is stolen, no registration
Cops patrolin
And now they done stopped me, and I get locked up

[Chorus]
They won't let me out, they won't let me out (I'm locked up)
They won't let me out no, they won't let me out (I'm locked up)
They won't let me out, they won't let me out (im locked up)
They won't let me out no, they won't let me out

[Verse 1 : Nas]
What's up kid? I know shit is rough doing your bid
When the cops came you should've slid to my crib
Fuck it black, no time for looking back it's done
Plus congratulations, you know you got a son?
I heard he looks like you, why don't your lady write you?
Told her she should visit, that's when she got hyper
Flippin, talk about he acts too rough
He didn't listen he be riffin' while I'm telling him stuff
I was like yeah, shorty don't care, she a snake too
Fucking with the niggas from that fake crew that hate you
But yo, guess who got shot in the dome-piece?
Jerome's niece, on her way home from Jones Beach
It's bugged, plus little Rob is selling drugs all the dime
Hangin out with young thugs that all carry 9's
At night time there's more trife than ever
What's up with Cormega, did you see 'em, are y'all together?
If so then hold the fort down, represent to the fullest
Say what's up to Herb, Ice and Bullet
I left a half a hundred in your commissary
You was my nigga when push came to shove one what? One love

[Verse 2 : Akon]
Headin up town to re-up
Back with a couple keys
The corner blocks on fire
Undercovers dressed as fiends
Makin so much money
Products moving fast
Put away the stash
And as I sold the last bag I fucked around and got locked up

[Chorus]
They won't let me out, they won't let me out (my nigga I'm locked up)
They won't let me out no, they won't let me out (I got locked up)
They won't let me out, they won't let me out (baby girl I'm locked up)
They won't let me out no, they won't let me out

[Verse 3 : Akon]
Cuz visitation no longer comes by
Seems like they forgot about me
Commissary is getting empty
Cell mates getting food without me
Can't wait to get out and move forward with my life
Got a family that loves me and wants me to do right
But instead I'm here locked up

[Chorous]
They won't let me out, they won't let me out
(ohhh I'm locked up)
They won't let me out no, they won't let me out
(my nigga I'm locked up)
They won't let me out, they won't let me out (I'm locked up)
They won't let me out no, they won't let me out

[Verse 4 : Nas]
Dear Born, you'll be out soon, stay strong
Out in New York the same shit is going on
The crack-heads stalking, loud-mouths is talking
Hold, check out the story yesterday when I was walking
The nigga you shot last year tried to appear
Like he hurtin' something word to mother, I heard him fronting
And he be pumping on your block, your man gave him your Glock
And now they run together, what up son, whatever
Since I'm on the streets I'm gonna put it to a cease
But I heard you blew a nigga with a ox for the phone piece
Whylin on the Island, but now with Elmira
Better chill cause them niggas will put that ass on fire
Last time you wrote you said they tried you in the showers
But maintain, when you come home the corner's ours
On the reels, all these crab niggas know the deal
When we start the revolution all they probably do is squeal
But chill, see you on the next V-I
I gave your mom dukes loot for kicks, plus sent you flicks
Your brother's buck whylin' in four maine he wrote me
He might beat his case, 'til he come home I play it lowkey
So stay civilised, time flies
Though incarcerated your mind dies, I hate it when your moms cries
It kinda wants to make me murder for real-a
I've even got a mask and gloves to bust slugs for one love

[Outro : Akon]
Pay me a visit (they won't let me out)
Send me some magazines (they won't let me out)
Send me some money orders (they won't let me out, no)
Pay me a visit, baby (they won't let me out)
Cuz I'm locked up, they won't let me out
Where's my lawyer? (they won't let me out)
I'm locked up, they won't let me out, no
Get me out of here (they won't let me out)
Im locked up (they won't let me out, they won't let me out)
Baby, I'm locked up (they won't let me out, no)
Where's my niggas? On the lock-down
I'm locked up, they won't let me out
I'm locked up, they won't let me out
Ohhh... they won't let me out
Can you please accept my phone calls?
Cuz I'm locked up, locked up, locked up
