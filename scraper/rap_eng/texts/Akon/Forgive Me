[Verse 1]
There's a first time for everything
It's definitely one of them nights
I knew when I looked in his eyes
That he was gonna be trouble for me
I never wanted to lie
I knew that my baby would cry
If he knew what we were doin'
But if his love don't pass the test
I gotta get it from somewhere else
Well, I'm grown and I need a man
Hope he understands, forgive me, baby

[Chorus]
But I gotta take a chance tonight
So I'm doin' me, myself
And I can't wait no more
Sittin' all alone
Man, I really hope, hope you forgive me, hey oh oh
Hope you forgive me, hey oh oh
Hope you forgive me, hey oh oh
I can't wait no more
Man, I really hope, hope you forgive me

[Verse 2]
Been a long time since I did something good for myself
But why should I be put through hell
When he's doin' what he wanna do?
I finally found somebody else
Who really wants to make me feel
Things that I've been missing so long
And his love always passed the test
It's a shame I had to look somewhere else
Well, I'm grown and I need a man
I just hope that he understands, forgive me, baby

[Chorus]
But I gotta take a chance tonight
So I'm doin' me, myself
And I can't wait no more
Sittin' all alone
Man, I really hope, hope you forgive me, hey oh oh
Hope you forgive me, hey oh oh
Hope you forgive me, hey oh oh
I can't wait no more
Man, I really hope, hope you forgive me

[Bridge]
Forgive me, but I need to be loved too
Forgive me, but I can't wait around for you
Forgive me if I found a man who understands
Just what I need, oh
Forgive me, but I need to be loved too
Forgive me if I can't wait around for you
Forgive me if I found a man who understands
Forgive me, baby

[Chorus]
But I gotta take a chance tonight
So I'm doin' me, myself
And I can't wait no more
Sittin' all alone
Man, I really hope, hope you forgive me, hey oh oh
Hope you forgive me, hey oh oh
Hope you forgive me, hey oh oh
I can't wait no more
Man, I really hope, hope you forgive me
But I gotta take a chance tonight
So I'm doin' me, myself
And I can't wait no more
Sittin' all alone
Man, I really hope, hope you forgive me
