[Chorus Akon]
Don't look no farther!
Baby im back (yeah)
Im here to cater to you (any thing that you want me to do: ill do it)
Cause Ill be your lover (ill be your lover)
Ill be your best friend
Tell me what I gotta do (tell me what I gotta do and ill do it)

[Baby Bash]
Now im back in a flesh
Feelin so blessed, back in your corner suga, suga don't stress
Forget about the rest; let's go inside, im back in your zone
Baby im back in your vibe, now I can't be denied I can't lie i'm on ya
I never ever wanna say sayonara
Some body told me that the grass was greener
On the other side of lake ariba
Never really used to be a mean to cheat her
What I gotta do to be a keeper
These words comin out the speaker, true love is off the meter

[Chorus]
[Baby Bash]
I was gone for a minute but now im home
Please forget me for being a rolling stone
Please forgive me let me polish it up like chrome
Get off the phone tell them squares to leave u alone
Let me spark your interest, now there's no more dating on the internet
Cause you already know how I get it wet, how I keep it so saucy and I get respect
You don't have to look no fartha, you dealin with the whole enchilada
You don't have to look no fartha, you hotter then a fire starter

[Chorus]
[Baby Bash]
I was gone for a minute, (oooohhh) [repeat x4]
Now im back let me hit it (oooohhh) [repeat x4]

[Chorus x2]
