Lonely
I'm Mr. Lonely
I have nobody
For my own

[Bridge]
Tune Mere Jaana (You , My Love)
Kabhi Nahi Jaana (Never did understand)
Ishq Mera (My Love)
Dard Mera (My Pain)

Aashiq Tera (Your lover)

Tune Mere Jaana (You My Love)
Kabhi Nahi Jaana (Never did understand)
Ishq Mera (My Love)
Dard Mera (My Pain)

[Verse 1]
Damn , you just walk away , telling me that i don't care
You know i always had tears in eyes , everytime i put down that cell from my hand
Just because you are away , out there in the world making your own steps
I had a dream to walk every path with you holding your hand
To face this life together forever like a friend
Wish i could see you once again 
Again like that fine day when i first saw you 
I don't know i felt like i already know you
Wish that every single star that you count 
I'd be there beside you 
With a note i wish never ends
Infinite papers to write down to
I hope that someday you will realize and think about 
Those little things i always do just make you smile 
Now that look i above , i can only see the emptiness 
The hollowness , the darkness is the only place that i could be in 
Cause the moment , you're gone i forgot whats called togetherness

Aashiq tera , bheed mein khoya rehta hai (Your lover , Is All Alone Even In The Crowd)
Jaanejahan pucho to itna kehta hai (If Sonmeone Asks , All Just He Says !)

Tune Mere Jaana (You , My Love)
Kabhi Nahi Jaana (Never ever knew)
Ishq Mera (My Love)
Dard Mera (My Pain)
Aashiq Tera (Your Lover)
Bheed Mein Khoya (Is All Alone Even In The Crowd)
Rehta hai
Rehta hai

[Verse 2]
Wait , don't go away
I'm still standing at the shore
The waves can only take me with them , Or wash me like a stone 
Come hug me like a tide , and let my mistakes flowing by my side 
I promise in this life , I'll be that shadow that you never see
I'll be that person , that you always wants me to be 
Not for you , just for me 
I know i can't love again , but i can always be 
And i'm so
