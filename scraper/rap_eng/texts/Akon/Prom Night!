We're gonna party like it's prom night

I just wanna sweat it out
On my clothes and in your mouth,yeah

[Verse 1]:
Dress me up, paint the town
Spike the punch
(oh woah)
Got me gone, I'm blown, I'm out to lunch
(oh woah)
Taser in my pocket
Got the flask, got the pipe
I know, I know what you like
I know, I know what you like

[Pre-chorus]:
I'll come pick you up
(I know you wanna)
Disappear with us
(we're going under)
Underneath your love
(make a dirty mess)
I'll make you remember this

[Verse 2]:
Dress me down, turn me on
Spill my drink
(oh woah)
Push it hard, push it good
Make me scream
(AHH oh woah)
I've never done this before
Condom wrappers on the floor
Oops I lied
Yeah we do this all the time

Underneath your love

I can't wait around
I'm gonna steal the crown
Everything I want I get
C'mon gimmie gimmie kiss
(muah)

We don't waste our time

You're too fine
You take everything I give
C'mon put this on your lips
(ha, ha ha ha)

Oh my god you look so beautiful
Wow, thank you
