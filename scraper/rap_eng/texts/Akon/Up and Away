[Verse 1] INNOSS'B
Where did you come from, uh la la la?
That's what I say is that I like
Come on into my world
Let me make you my girl!
Hang you my heart, keep it a while
I swear my love, die for your smile
I wish I had to surprise
Be the sun of my sky!

You got me, babe, don't let me go!
We're going, I'm invisible

[Verse 2] INNOSS'B
Put your pretty hand inside of mine
You'll see flies, when you have a good time, oh oh, yeah
Tell me your secret, I'll do no harm
Be when you need me, running to my arms
Babe, nothing can hurt you now, yeah!

[Verse 3] AKON
Yeah, yeah I'll make you fly when I get up
Excuse me if I'm rolling
I'm trying to get up with her, catch me at the mall and
She know how this pimping thing go
And if she doesn't, I'mma have to put it down slow
Cause she's the type of woman I'll pick a fence in the garden
House in the suburbs to wake up every morning
The love I have for you I do know
You're the woman in my life I don't let go!

Oh, oh you're my baby
Oh, oh, you're my baby
Oh, oh you drive me crazy
Oh, oh forever my lady!
