Lonely, I'm Mr. Lonely
I have nobody for my own
I'm so lonely, I'm Mr. Lonely
I have nobody for my own
I'm so lonely

Yo, this one here goes out to all my playas out there, man, ya know?
That got that one good girl, dawg, that's always been there, man, like
Then one day she can't take it no more and decide to leave

Yeah, I woke up in the middle of the night
Wonderin' why she had to go and take that flight
Could've sworn I was dreamin', for her I feenin'
So I had to take a little ride

Back trackin' on these few years
Tryin' to figure out what I do to make it go bad
'Cause ever since my girl left me
My whole life came crashin' and I'm so

Lonely
(So lonely)
I'm Mr. Lonely
(Mr. Lonely)
I have nobody
(I have nobody)
For my own
(To call my own, girl)

I'm so lonely
(So lonely)
I'm Mr. Lonely
(Mr. Lonely)
I have nobody
(I have nobody)
For my own
(To call my own, girl)
I'm so lonely

Can't believe I had a girl like you
And I just let you walk right outta my life
After all I put you through
You still stuck around and stayed by my side

What really hurt me is I broke your heart
Baby you a good girl and I had no right
I really wanna make things right
'Cause without you in my life girl I'm so

Lonely
(So lonely)
I'm Mr. Lonely
(Mr. Lonely)
I have nobody
(I have nobody)
For my own
(To call my own, girl)

I'm so lonely
(So lonely)
I'm Mr. Lonely
(Mr. Lonely)
I have nobody
(I have nobody)
For my own
(To call my own, baby)
I'm so lonely

Been all over the world, ain't never met a girl
That could take the things that you been through
Never thought the day would come where you would get up and run
And I would be out chasin' you

'Cause there ain't nowhere in the globe I'd rather be
Ain't no one in the globe I'd rather see
Than the girl of my dreams that made me be
So happy but now so lonely

Lonely
(So lonely)
I'm Mr. Lonely
(Mr. Lonely)
I have nobody
(I have nobody)
For my own
(To call my own, no)

I'm so lonely
(So lonely)
I'm Mr. Lonely
(Mr. Lonely)
I have nobody
(I have nobody)
For my own
(To call my own, girl)
I'm so lonely

Never thought that I'd be alone
(Be alone)
I didn't think you'd be gone this long
(Gone so long)
I just want you to call my phone
So stop playin' girl and come on home

Baby girl I didn't mean to shout
(No)
I want me and you to work it out
(Work it out baby)
I never wished to ever hurt my baby
And it's drivin' me crazy 'cause I'm so

Lonely
(So lonely)
I'm Mr. Lonely
(Mr. Lonely)
I have nobody
(I have nobody)
For my own
(To call my own, no)

I'm so lonely
(So lonely)
I'm Mr. Lonely
(Mr. Lonely)
I have nobody
(I have nobody)
For my own
(To call my own, girl)
I'm so lonely

So lonely, so lonely
Mr. Lonely, so lonely
So lonely, so lonely
So lonely, Mr. Lonely
