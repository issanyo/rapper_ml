Its akon man, my man P
Its the magic city baby
Yo i think we got one on this one

So all them haters, wanna scream my name? (then keep on calling)
And they wouldn't support us before but wanna scream now? (let them keep on calling)
We gonna let them just keep on calling baby, just keep calling (so keep on calling)
And for our supporters, you know you can just keep calling as long as you want (keep on calling)

I used to be up on the corner all day, tryin to figure out whats gonna get me out there
Dope dealing and hugging the block, i done found out ain't gonna get me nowhere
Used to keep a nine milli for protection, just in case a nigga wanna take my bread
Then the voice came down from the sky and said... Akon use your head

I had to re-evaluate my thoughts and think about what God made us for,(made us for)
Had to keep a strong faith and believing, know one day I'd be a star (A star)
But I knew that it wouldn't come easy(Come easy)
Seen a whole lotta hate and believe me (believe me)
Despite all the bullshit we had to still work hard, to get to where we are

So when you hear them calling out "Akon", let them keep on calling
When you hear the world calling out "P-money", let them keep on calling
Cause we went through hell and back to get here, so keep on calling
Let me hear you now, let me hear you now, let me hear you just keep on calling

Senegal West Africa to New Zealand (New Zealand)
Blessed to have the gift to make music with meaning (With meaning)
Cause i never thought i'd come this far, with a mansion and a fancy car
Never thought success would come this quick in the beggining (but I seen it)

And all along I'm sitting there thinking that its harder when you came from the hood (Came from the hood)
When all I had to do was put my mind to it, and realise that it was all good (It was all good)
Cause once the good word went and held me down, you best believe I won't be turning back
I had to keep on moving and to keep on grooving right here on this P-Money track
And so

When you hear them calling out "Akon" Let them keep on calling
When you hear the world calling out "P-Money" Let them keep on calling
Cause we went through hell and back to get here, so keep on calling
Let me hear you now, let me hear you now, let me hear you just keep on calling
Keep on calling, keep on calling, just keep on calling, keep on calling
Just keep on calling, keep on calling, just keep on calling, keep on calling

When you hear them calling out "Akon" Let them keep on calling
When you hear the world calling out "P-Money" Let them keep on calling
Cause we went through hell and back to get here, so keep on calling
Let me hear you now, let me hear you now, let me hear you just keep on calling
