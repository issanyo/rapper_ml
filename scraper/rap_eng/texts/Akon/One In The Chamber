[Verse 1: Akon]
She's a drama queen
Queen from a movie scene
Scene, she did everything
Thing, and that's all I could ask for
Know she was a pain
Pain, oh how I miss her brain
Brain couldn't stop that train
Train brushes colder than glass scars

[Hook: Akon]
That chick had one in the chamber
Just when I thought I was out of danger
Four ring and I still went out and banged her
Banged her, it's all fucked up now
It's all fucked up now
That chick had one in the chamber
Just when I thought I was out of danger
Four ring and I still went out and banged her
Yeah, I banged her, and it's all fucked up now
It's all fucked up now

[Verse 2: Akon]
Should've known the first time
First time felt good, but it was the worst time
The worst time, them pretty birds fly
Then them doves cry
It's all fucked up now
Cause I'm hooked up now
It'll never be the same now
Cause my only hopes going down the drain now
There is just nothing left to say now
Say now, cause it's over now
It's over now

[Hook: Akon]
Cause she had one in the chamber
Just when I thought I was out of danger
Four ring and I still went out and banged her
Yeah, I banged her, and it's all fucked up now
All fucked up now
That chick had one in the chamber
Just when I thought I was out of danger
Four ring and I still went out and banged her
Oh yes, banged her, it's all fucked up now
It's all fucked up now

[Bridge]
She got one in the chamber
She got one in the chamber
She keep one in the chamber
That chick keep one in the chamber
Chamber
