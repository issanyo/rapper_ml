[Chorus: Akon]
I Can't Go Know Where
Unless Your By My Side
I Gotta Have You Here
Right Here By My Side
Can't Roam The Town
Unless Your By My Side
Gotta Have You Around
Right Here By My Side

[Verse 1: Trazz]
Ok
See Heres Some Things Im Tryin To Say Dyin To Say
I Keep Real With You Ain't No Crime Today
See I Been Thinkin About It All Day
In Brod Day
How You Stuck With Me And Been By My Side Like An Entray Before Imma Give You Diamonds Like Kanye
Nuttin Less Then 3000 Like Andre
And When I Come Home Sick You Always Stay Up With The Light On For The Kid Like Motel Sex
Never Think About Flowin With This
Callin It Quits
So I Can't Give A Damn About These Hotel Chicks
Comming At Me Like A Linebacker Blitz And That Don't Me Shit But Keep A Close Snitch To Get Hitch Like Will Smith(So Uh)
You Blowin My Ways And All The Things I Hate About You You Would Be Willing To Change We Was In The Right Lane The Way This Smash Was Made So There Ain't A Damn Thing Im Willin To Change This My Stand

[Chorus: Akon]
I Can't Go Know Where
Unless Your By My Side
I Gotta Have You Here
Right Here By My Side
Can't Roam The Town
Unless Your By My Side
Gotta Have You Around
Right Here By My Side

[Verse 2: Trazz]
Yeah
Listen
We Go Together Like Coffee And Cream
Water And Steam
As Long As Your Supporting Your Dream It's Your Team
When Im Done You Be Keeping Me Up Like Caffine
So As Long As Money Is Green Your All I Need
And I Dont Know What Ive Done To Deserve It Cause You Always Keep My Head Above Water Like A Life Preserver
So I Buy You Ruggs And Purses Just To Give Worser
And We Prey For Life Situations Where It Determines
Chicks Holla But They All About The Dollars
I Never Bothered You Were Here When I Started It
And You Been Making It Clear How To Still Support The Kid When You Have Your Own Career When Like Anything
We Been Through Up And Downs Hand And Hand And Can't Imangine Me Going Through What I Did Without You Here(Uh Uh)
So I Promise You Bearts As A Man You Can Have The World When Its In The Palms Of My Hands

[Chorus: Akon]
I Can't Go Know Where
Unless Your By My Side
I Gotta Have You Here
Right Here By My Side
Can't Roam The Town
Unless Your By My Side
Gotta Have You Around
Right Here By My Side

[Verse 3: Trazz]
Yeh
Now Baby Tell Me Wats Good Wat U Love Cause We Were Goin Through Out Trials Like A City Court Judge
Givin All
And My Life Right Here In Front Of This Judge So My Goons Out
Problems Here Give Me Slugs
Cause I Hate To Keep You Waitin But Things Are So Close Right Now I Can Taste It
And You Gonna See It All Shopping Sprees And Vactions So If U Eva Left I Would Never Find A Replacement

[Chorus: Akon]
I Can't Go Know Where
Unless Your By My Side
I Gotta Have You Here
Right Here By My Side
Can't Roam The Town
Unless Your By My Side
Gotta Have You Around
Right Here By My Side..Right Here By My Side
I Can't Go Know Where...
I Gotta Have You Here
Can't Roam The Town...
Gotta Have You Around...
Right Here By My SÃ¯de...
