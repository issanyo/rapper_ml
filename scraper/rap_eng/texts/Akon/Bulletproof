[Intro]
Konvict

[Verse 1]
This is true love
Another day we won't fall
Beauty and the beast, boy
We'll find a way to carry on
We ain't never gonna let go
So forget about the past
The future is now
And we gotta make it last 'cause I--

[Pre-Chorus]
Love you
In spite all we've been through
Trial after trial
Ain't nothin' gonna tear us down (no-oh-oh...)
Because we're built with
A love that keeps us shielded
So let them keep on shootin'
Them shots gon' hit the ground

[Chorus]
'Cause love will find a way-ay-ay
Even through the hurt and the pain
'Cause what we got is bulletproof (bulletproof) bulletproof
They can't kill our love (they can't kill our love)
'Cause what we got is bulletproof (bulletproof) bulletproof
They can't kill our love
Ain't no threat to us
We're bulletproof

[Verse 2]
So go ahead and throw your sticks
And you can cast all your stones
Anything you throw our way
I bet we gon' duck
I bet you gon' miss if we don't
But we laugh and we cry
I don't gotta cover your heart boy
I'm by your side
Ready to ride and it's all because I--

[Pre-Chorus]
Love you
In spite all we've been through
Trial after trial
Ain't nothin' gonna tear us down (no-oh-oh...)
Because we're built with
A love that keeps us shielded
So let them keep on shootin'
Them shots gon' hit the ground

[Chorus]
'Cause love will find a way-ay-ay
Even through the hurt and the pain
'Cause what we got is bulletproof (bulletproof) bulletproof
They can't kill our love (they can't kill our love)
'Cause what we got is bulletproof (bulletproof) bulletproof
They can't kill our love
Ain't no threat to us
We're bulletproof

[Bridge]
We'll get past
Every lie
And we'll swim through
Every tide
Even if they let
A thousand rounds go
I bet
We survive...

[Pre-Chorus]
I love you
In spite all we've been through
Trial after trial
Ain't nothin' gonna tear us down, oh no (no-oh-oh...)
Because we're built with
A love that keeps us shielded
So let them keep on shootin'
Them shots gon' hit the ground

[Chorus]
'Cause love will find a way-ay-ay (we'll find a way)
Even through the hurt and the pain (and the pain)
'Cause what we got is bulletproof (bulletproof) bulletproof
They can't kill our love (they can't kill our love)
'Cause what we got is bulletproof (bulletproof) bulletproof
They can't kill our love
Ain't no threat to us
We're bulletproof
