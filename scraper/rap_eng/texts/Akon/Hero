We get it poppin' on site
I'm sure you already know my stylo
See I've never been a buster just a true hustler, my squad is lethal
Come with the right price
I can make you look bigger then nino
Just put a gun in your hand let you ride with the man cause I'm a motherfucking hero

[T.I.]
Just to make sure he don't get it clear like Pallegrino
From asceno to a kilo I'mma neighborhood hero
They be talking blow but they ain't never seen a key though
Never chop them 63's down to triple 0
Hate on me so much but I'm what you wanna be though
Might of went triple platinum but you never been a G though
I keep the 50 with me tote it round like it legal
Fly like a seagull, ride around with 3 girls
Keep it pimpin' with me you know you don't want to see those
So what we can meet up you get your ass beat up
The reason people honor me the reason why you under me
You don't believe we run the streets well come and see nigga

[T.I.]
I'm the man that's apparent even when I'm running errands
Got to be the McLaren or what I'm wearing got 'em staring
Bitches I share em if they in my harem
They ain't getting high well I don't go near 'em
Nigga wanna die tell him buck I dare 'em
I ain't gonna spare 'em homie I'm gonna tear 'em
Apart from his heart to his ass swear to God
Give a fuck about his partner give a damn about a charge
I take it to far pull up where ever you are
Empty clips in your new car
Picture you dead and zoom off
Admit it you lost probably cause shawty to raw
You flaw ayy tell em how we do dawg

[Hook: Akon]

[Akon]
Got a box of ammo that I rarely use
9 millimeter that shine like shoes
Hope the day never come where a nigga have to
Let it go on the bust and hope it ain't you
Cause I be on deck on the grind like sex
Taking over local city street like feds
Breaking down ever nickel, every dime, every brick
Down to the last dollar, I mean every bit
