This is so annoying
I'd say grow up but I know that you won't
I don't understand what's so hard
You either wanna be with me or you don't

One day you love me
Next day you wanna leave
You're so up and down
Off in your own

Well, I'm about good and tired of this
Too fly for you to not know what you want

So let me know whatcha gonna do?
Stay or go 'cause I'm not waiting
Baby, yes or no, I'm about to decide for you
Stay or go, stay or go, stay or go
Stay or go, stay or go

Tried to give you real love
That's when you up and run away
But when I act like I'm done with you
That's when you decide you wanna stay

I don't got time to waste like this
Too fly to put up with your day to day

So let me know whatcha gonna do?
Stay or go 'cause I'm not waiting
Yes or no, I'm about to decide for you
Stay or go, stay or go
Stay or go, stay or go

Let me know whatcha gonna do, do, do?
I gotta know, know 'cause I'm not waiting
Not anymore, about to decide for you
Stay or go, I gotta know, stay or go

Yes or no, whatcha gonna do?
Stay or go 'cause I'm not waiting
Yes or no, I'm about to decide for you
Stay or go, stay or go
Stay or go, stay or go
