Run so many miles
I run
I left the others in the dust
I know exactly what i want
I'll catch up
Because

Ooh i want you now
Want you now now now
Feels like i'm off the ground
Off the ground ground ground
'til i find you i'm never coming down down down
Until you're mine i'll be dreaming of you
Even with so much to lose
Being without you just won't do
And since this world is so confused
You should know that

I'll be chasing you
Heading straight to you
'til i'm facing you
I'll be chasing you
Ooh i want you now
Want you now now now
Ooh i want you now
Want you now now now

Time
I'm always racing time
Cause i forget that you and i
Are written in the stars
And i can't rest 'til i'm where you are

Ooh i want you now
Want you now now now
Feels like i'm off the ground
Off the ground ground ground
'til i find you i'm never coming down down down
Until you're mine i'll be dreaming of you

Even with so much to lose
Being without you just won't do
And since this world is so confused
You should know that

I'll be chasing you
Heading straight to you
'til i'm facing you
I'll be chasing you
Ooh i want you now
Want you now now now
Ooh i want you now
Want you now now now

I left my doubts in the shadows
Threw caution to the wind yeah
Finding you somewhere somehow was never a question no
Cause while i'm restless searching for you
I know you're restless searching for me too

I'll be chasing you
Heading straight to you
'til i'm facing you
I'll be chasing you
Ooh i want you now
Want you now now now
Ooh i want you now
Want you now now now

Run so many miles
I run
I left the others in the dust
I know exactly what i want
I'll catch up
