[feat. Layza]

(Intro)(Layza)

One step two step killing sum breh (breh)
I'm known to kill mans then move somewhere
Man looks at me and he's in for a scare (scare)
Bust out the chorus and pass me the chair

(Chorus)(Kano)
If you think I'm hot... Show me your tits
I will pick a gyal then take her to the ritz
We fuck all night then make sum kids
Then back to the studio to make sum hits
[x2]

(Layza)
So look, how come I'm in top notch
And you're out on the streets trying to kotch
I don't mean to offend thee but it's just my turn
Let me spit my lyrics and watch you burn
Yeh Mr ka to tha no... And layza...
Sounds of the Carpenders Park or perhaps the Watford?
Nahhhh

(Kano)
Watch out for the album on it's way
