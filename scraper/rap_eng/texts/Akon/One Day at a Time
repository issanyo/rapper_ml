[Intro]
Akon, Enrique
Red One, Konvict
One day at a time
One day at a time

[Verse 1]
I saw you in the club
You were dancing with somebody
So close so tight
You were killing me so slowly
My friends were telling me what you're doing
Can drive a man so crazy
I try to live my life
It's been 6 months since you left me

[Pre-Chorus]
So I oh I oh I
Still thinking about you baby
I try I try
But I guess I gotta take it

[Chorus]
One day at a time
I gotta let you go
One day at a time
It seems so impossible
One day at a time
I gotta let you go
And I know
Yes I know
I gotta take it
One day at a time

[Bridge]
One day, one day, one day
One day at a time
One day, one day, one day
One day at a time

[Verse 2]
I am not of jealous type
But you stole my heart baby
Dancing with that guy
Made it so hard for me to watch baby
I just spinning around in circles
I'm going through it in my mind baby
Had to suck up the tears from my nostrils
To stop from crying out loud baby

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh I oh I
Still thinking about you baby
I try I try
Can't stop thinking about you baby

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
First thing I gotta do is try to face it
But your voice keeps playing in my ear
It just makes me crazy trying to fake it
The true event's so bad, it's not what I wanna hear
But I guess I gotta take it

[Chorus][x3]
