[HOOK]
Everybody I know, around my way still there, (everybody still there)
Waitin' for a miracle to pass them by (by, by, by)
Most of them are known drug dealers and I know them well
Yes I know them well
That's the only way they know how to survive
Cause it's the way to get by, (it's the way to get by)
It's the only way to get by, (it's the way to get by)
Cause if I had a choice aside from this life, God knows I'd try

[VERSE]
Blood stains on the concrete, and all the wall
Little snotty nose kids with guns up in their draws
You'll see it all in them project halls
I'm surprised I'm still sane with all I saw
Spoons, dirty needles, and death is on the daily
Nobody is exempt, not even little babies
We just tryna survive out here, how many really livin'?
We ain't alive out here!
Makin' it to 21 is a blessing, little homie only 12
Why the fuck is he stressing?
His mama's a crackhead, his sister's a bloodhound
His daddy's a jailbird, so he can sit full now

[HOOK]
Everybody I know, around my way still there, (everybody still there)
Waitin' for a miracle to pass them by (by, by, by)
Most of them are known drug dealers and I know them well
Yes I know them well
That's the only way they know how to survive
Cause it's the way to get by, (it's the way to get by)
It's the only way to get by, (it's the way to get by)
Cause if I had a choice aside from this life, God knows I'd try

[VERSE]
In the same jeans everyday, hustlin' for the gwap
Day in and day out, hopin' I don't get knocked
Keep my mind on my money, money on my mind
My finger on the trigger, hand on my nine
By any means, I'm playin' for the win
Momma told me to slow it down, or I'm goin' to the pen
Fuck it, I gotta get it, it's a must
Cause it's grimey out here
Tell me, who can I really trust?
Me, and only me, I'm strapped up and on one
Niggas out here know I ain't takin' shit from no one
Little niggas, big niggas with the llamas
And anyone else who want any type of drama

[HOOK]
Everybody I know, around my way still there, (everybody still there)
Waitin' for a miracle to pass them by (by, by, by)
Most of them are known drug dealers and I know them well
Yes I know them well
That's the only way they know how to survive
Cause it's the way to get by, (it's the way to get by)
It's the only way to get by, (it's the way to get by)
Cause if I had a choice aside from this life, God knows I'd try
(to get away...)
