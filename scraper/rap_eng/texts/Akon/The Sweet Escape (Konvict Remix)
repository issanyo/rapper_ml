[Intro: Akon, Gwen Stefani, Both]
Konvict Remix
Akon and Gwen Stefani
We wanna get away up front

[Verse 1: Akon, Gwen Stefani]
Shorty I know you, and you know me
Imma find ways to get to that cheese
Steady trynna stake, run off in them streets
Similar to Bonnie and Clyde on TV
Ain't nobody driving me crazy
But my money, pride and my lady
Please don't go, we're too far to chase it
Been to close for me to escape it
So I, jumped up in the Audubon of my my Maserati
Switched up real quick and peeled off in my Bugatti
Girl, Imma run away with you
Let me rub all over your body
When you can run away with me
While I kick back watch you get naughty

[Chorus: Gwen Stefani]
If I could escape and recreate a place that's my own world
And I could be your favorite girl (forever), perfectly together
Tell me boy, now wouldn't that be sweet? (sweet escape)
If I could be sweet, I know I've been a real bad girl (I'll try to change)
I didn't mean for you to get hurt (whatsoever)
We can make it better
Tell me boy, wouldn't that be sweet? (sweet escape)

[Bridge: Gwen Stefani]
If I could escape
If I could escape

[Verse 2: Gwen Stefani]
You melt me down, I'm at my lowest boiling point
Come help me out, I need to get me out of this joint
Come on, let's bounce, counting on you to turn me around
Instead of clowning around, let's look for some common ground
So baby, times get a little crazy
I've been gettin' a little lazy
Waitin' on you to come save me
I can see that you're angry by the way that you treat me
Hopefully you don't leave me, wanna take you with me

[Chorus: Gwen Stefani]
If I could escape and recreate a place that's my own world
And I could be your favorite girl (forever), perfectly together
Tell me boy, now wouldn't that be sweet? (sweet escape)
If I could be sweet, I know I've been a real bad girl (I'll try to change)
I didn't mean for you to get hurt (whatsoever)
We can make it better
Tell me boy, wouldn't that be sweet? (sweet escape)
Woo hoo, yee hoo
(All my ladies, all my fellas)
Woo hoo, yee hoo
(All my ladies, all my fellas)
Woo hoo, yee hoo
(All my ladies, all my fellas)
Woo hoo, yee hoo
(All my ladies)

[Bridge: Gwen Stefani]
Cause I've been acting like sour milk all on the floor
It's your fault you didn't shut the refrigerator
Maybe that's the reason I've been acting so cold?

[Chorus - Gwen Stefani]
If I could escape and recreate a place that's my own world
And I could be your favorite girl (forever), perfectly together
Tell me boy now wouldn't that be sweet? (sweet escape)
If I could be sweet (be sweet)
I know I've been a real bad girl (I'll try to change)
I didn't mean for you to get hurt (whatso ever)
We can make it better
Tell me boy wouldn't that be sweet? (sweet escape)

[Outro: Gwen Stefani]
Woo hoo, yee hoo
(If I could escape)
Woo hoo, yee hoo
Woo hoo, yee hoo
(If I could escape)
Woo hoo, yee hoo
Woo hoo, yee hoo
(If I could escape)
Woo hoo, yee hoo
