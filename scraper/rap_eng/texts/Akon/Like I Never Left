[Intro]
Konvict
Akon and Whitney, yeah
(Oh yeah)

[Verse 1: Whitney Houston]
Did you ever wish you could get back
Something that you did in your past?
If it wasn't for me I know what we had
Was definitely gonna last
I admit that we say some things
We don't mean when we're mad
But I realize that I've been foolish
I never should have turned my back

[Pre-Chorus: Whitney Houston]
Because it's a cold world when you're out there all alone
So many times that I wanted to just pick up the phone
And tell you ooh baby, baby, I missed your loving so
I ain't holding back no more, your girl is coming home

[Chorus 1: Whitney Houston]
And I want you to love me
(Like I never left)
And I want you to hold me
(Like I never left)
And I want you to touch me
(Like I never left)
Come give me what I'm missing, yeah
(Like I never left, yeah)

[Verse 3: Akon]
Do you think we can pick up
Where we left before the day?
That I told you it was over, packed my things
And moved away

[Bridge: Akon]
Because I see that without you
My world is just an empty place
Taking one step away from you feels like
A million miles away

[Pre-Chorus: Akon]
Because it's a cold world when you're out there all alone
So many times that I wanted to just pick up the phone
And tell you ooh baby, baby, I missed your loving so
But I ain't holding back no more, your girl is coming home

[Chorus 1: Whitney Houston]
And I want you to love me
(Like I never left)
And I want you to hold me
(Like I never left)
And I want you to touch me
(Like I never left)
Come give me what I'm missing, yeah
(Like I never left, yeah)

[Chorus 2: Whitney Houston]
I had enough, I miss you bad
What I did, leave in the past
Yes, your girl is coming back
Like I never left, oh

[Verse 4: Akon]
Said back in the building, back on the block
You and me together, we back on top
Kind of love we got, it just don't stop
Like I never left

[Chorus 2: Whitney Houston]
I had enough, I miss you bad
What I did, leave in the past
Yes, your girl is coming back
Like I never left, oh

[Verse 4: Akon]
Said back in the building, back on the block
(I'm coming back home, boy)
You and me together, we back on top
(Yeah)
Kind of love we got, it just don't stop
Like I never left

[Bridge: Whitney Houston]
(And I want you to love me)
Like I never left
And I want you to hold me
Like I never left
(Oh, and I want you to hold me)
And I want you to touch me
Like I never left
Come give me what I'm missing
Like I never left, yeah
(And I want you to love me)

[Outro: Whitney Houston]
Oh baby, come love me, come hold me
Come touch me, come give me
Like I never left
(I never left you, baby)
Oh baby, come love me, come hold me
Come touch me, come give me
Like I never left
(I never left you, baby)
