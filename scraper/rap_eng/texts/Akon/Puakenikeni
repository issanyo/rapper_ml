[Intro: Akon]
Y'all ain't ready
Y'all ain't ready
Y'all ain't ready
Well, how you get 'em girl? Ami down south

[Chorus: Nicole Scherzinger]
That's how you get 'em girl
That's how you get 'em girl
That's how you get 'em girl
How you get 'em girl? Ami down south
Everybody's looking at me (That's how you get 'em girl)
They like the way I turn up the heat (That's how you get 'em girl)
So all let's go get out on the streets (That's how you get 'em girl)
That's how I get 'em girl, Ami down south

[Verse 1: Nicole Scherzinger]
Every time I move, I feel like they up under me
Call it intuition, but I know they wanna see
Wanna see, wanna see, oh, the curiosity
How far they can take it with this wicky Hawaiianea

[Pre-Chorus: Nicole Scherzinger]
Don't you wanna pick my Puakenikeni?
Don't you wanna pick my Puakenikeni?
Don't you wanna catch me in my red bikini
Nothing's sweeter than my Puakenikeni

[Chorus: Nicole Scherzinger]
That's how you get 'em girl
That's how you get 'em girl
That's how you get 'em girl
How you get 'em girl? Ami down south
Everybody's looking at me (That's how you get 'em girl)
They like the way I turn up the heat (That's how you get 'em girl)
So all let's go get out on the streets (That's how you get 'em girl)
That's how I get 'em girl, Ami down south

[Verse 2: Nicole Scherzinger]
I see you scoop and jump to get a little closer to me
Thinking I don't notice, you have been all up on me
50 feet, 50 feet, boy, get up off from me
The way I drop my arm and make them rush all over me

[Pre-Chorus: Nicole Scherzinger]
Don't you wanna pick my Puakenikeni?
Don't you wanna pick my Puakenikeni?
Don't you wanna catch me in my red bikini
Nothing's sweeter than my Puakenikeni

[Chorus: Nicole Scherzinger]
That's how you get 'em girl
That's how you get 'em girl
That's how you get 'em girl
How you get 'em girl? Ami down south
Everybody's looking at me (That's how you get 'em girl)
They like the way I turn up the heat (That's how you get 'em girl)
So all let's go get out on the streets (That's how you get 'em girl)
That's how I get 'em girl, Ami down south

[Verse 3: Brick & Lace]
Sit 'em up then, sit 'em up, .... wants to know it
Sit 'em up then, sit 'em up, .... wants to know it
It's Brick & Lace and Nicole up at night to party
And when we're on, we downsouth, get 'em roudy
Haven't said that woman Puakeni, said it sweet (yeah)
We get that something from the Puakeni-tree
I'm like Eve in the Garden, I feel tempted to eat this
My love is wicked, people want to repeat this

[Bridge: Nicole Scherzinger]
It ain't incorrectly (They callin' out ya name)
It ain't incorrectly (They gonna start a flame)
It ain't incorrectly (They callin' out ya name)
It ain't incorrectly (They gonna start a flame)

[Pre-Chorus: Nicole Scherzinger]
Don't you wanna pick my Puakenikeni?
Don't you wanna pick my Puakenikeni?
Don't you wanna catch me in my red bikini
Nothing's sweeter than my Puakenikeni

[Chorus: Nicole Scherzinger]
That's how you get 'em girl
That's how you get 'em girl
That's how you get 'em girl
Well, how you get 'em girl? Ami down south
Everybody's looking at me (That's how you get 'em girl)
They like the way I turn up the heat (That's how you get 'em girl)
So all let's go get out on the streets (That's how you get 'em girl)
That's how I get 'em girl, Ami down south

[Outro: Nicole Scherzinger]
Don't you wanna pick my Puakenikeni?(That's how you get 'em girl)
Don't you wanna pick my Puakenikeni? (That's how you get 'em girl)
Don't you wanna catch me in my red bikini? (That's how you get 'em girl)
How you get 'em girl? Ami down south
