[Verse 1]
I'm blind, where is my sense
Feeling like I'd never seen me again
Oh I deserted myself
Promised that I'd never leave me again
Who'd ever thought I'd run away?
From what's been chasing me so long
If I would've learned to love the pain
I'd be right here all along

[Pre-Chorus]
Did I just die and I guess it feels like I'm flying
Finally feel so right in my eyes, no disguising

[Chorus]
I'm a stranger, stranger, stranger
Keeps getting, stranger, stranger
I'm a stranger, stranger, stranger
Keeps getting, stranger, stranger

[Verse 2]
My eyes, look at my face
Somebody tell me who is she
Alive, touched in space
Kissed by a shadow haunting me
And like a hostage to my doubts
Trying to be anything else but I
Soon as I let the mask fall down
You tell me that you love me harder now

[Pre-Chorus]
Did I just die and I guess it feels like I'm flying
Finally feel so right in my eyes, no disguising

[Chorus]
I'm a stranger, stranger, stranger
Keeps getting, stranger, stranger
I'm a stranger, stranger, stranger
Keeps getting, stranger, stranger

[Bridge]
Keeps getting, stranger, stranger
Keeps getting, stranger, stranger
(Fear, run)
I'm not afraid of imperfection
(Fear, run)
But I'm afraid of being remembered for my imperfection
(Chase)
I will not stalk my desires
(Chase)
Before I run towards reality

[Pre-Chorus]
Did I just die and I guess it feels like I'm flying
Finally feel so right in my eyes, no disguising

[Chorus]
I'm a stranger, stranger, stranger
Keeps getting, stranger, stranger
I'm a stranger, stranger, stranger
Keeps getting, stranger, stranger
