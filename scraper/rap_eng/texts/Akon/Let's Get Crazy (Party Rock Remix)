[Intro: Redfoo & Cassie]
Once again we at the party it don't stop (don't stop)
We LMFAO we make it hot (make it hot)
Once again we at the party it don't stop (don't stop)
(Let's get crazy tonight)
We LMFAO and Cassie (we Party Rock)
Once again we at the party it don't stop (don't stop)
We LMFAO we make it hot (make it hot)
Once again we at the party it don't stop (don't stop)
(Let's get crazy tonight)
We LMFAO and Cassie (we Party Rock)
(Party Rock, Party Rock, Party Rock)
(Let's get crazy tonight)

[Verse 1: Cassie]
I'm right here, all over the place like bubbles
My shine is like America's next top model
Hands clap when I'm rolling my body
That's a seven if I was rolling the dice
I don't care, I'll be dancing upon your table
Steal your bottle and I'll suck it down to the bottom
Think that I'm cute to you, just smile
What you gon' do about it now?
Let's get crazy tonight
Let's get crazy tonight

[Chorus: Cassie]
Let's get crazy tonight
Let's get crazy tonight
Let's get crazy tonight
Let's get crazy tonight
Let's get crazy tonight

[Verse 2: Akon]
Shawty so wow, shawty got style
Doing everything to me to make me just want it now
I can see how, body keep mesmerizing on me with that beautiful smile
Checking me down
To a point to where I can't even speak no more
But needing you to know
That I'm a fan
And the way you got me caught up on you tonight I'll never understand
Taking every bit of me to be so polite to be a gentleman
But I can't help to have the same [?] that you have in your command
So let's just go crazy

[Chorus: Cassie]
Let's get crazy tonight
Let's get crazy tonight
Let's get crazy tonight
Let's get crazy tonight
Let's get crazy tonight

[Verse 3: Redfoo]
Now everybody put your drink in the air (the air)
And down the mothaf***** like you just don't care
Now everybody put your drink in the air (the air)
And down the mothaf***** like you just don't care
Now bounce that booty's poppin out
Make me wanna scream and shout
I'm jumping up and down (causing mayhem)
Damn she drop it to the ground
DJ play it loud, that Party Rock sound (to the AM, rock in peace)

[Chorus: Cassie]
Let's get crazy tonight
Let's get crazy tonight
Let's get crazy tonight
Let's get crazy tonight
Let's get crazy tonight
