Konvict
Akon and Rasheeda

[Rasheeda:]
Cause I got this hump (yeah)
In my back (yeah)
And everytime he hears the bass
He just wants to clap(yeah)

[Akon:]
Let it clap, clap, clap, clap, clap, clap, clap [x2]

Come on and let it

Clap, clap, clap, clap, clap, clap, clap [x2]

[Rasheeda:]
Come on and let it clap
Picture perfect
Paint a perfect picture
What's the dime pieces in it in the club get quicker (Woah)
Now let's make this clear
Got a lil' tips and now we bound it over here
Rasheeda got them fiddling
Sit inside daze boy I see you later
Tell me what you thinking
Is that really you talking or what you drinking
You better put a tag on it
See this hump in my back
Now you wanna grab on it
I can make it pop like it's got a tag on it
If I let you beat it up you gotta put a man on it

[Bridge: Akon]
Now the way you open up like a folder
Wanna see it clap when you bend it over (eeh)
Watch how you grind on me
Drop down likes down on me

[Rasheeda:]
Cause I got this hump (yeah)
In my back (yeah)
And everytime he hears the bass
He just wants to clap(yeah)

[Akon]
Let it clap, clap, clap, clap, clap, clap, clap [x2]

Come on and let it

Clap, clap, clap, clap, clap, clap, clap [x2]
