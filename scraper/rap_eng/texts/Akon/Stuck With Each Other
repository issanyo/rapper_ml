{Shontelle}
You can, think you could get free
You think you won't need me
That you're gonna get you somethin' better
But you know that we're in this forever
And you can, think you can walk out
Even with your doubts
But you know that we're in this together
You can try to push me from you
Nothing you do can pull us a part
{Chorus}
Cause it's too late, there's no escape
Might as well face it
Baby we're stuck with each other
Stuck with each other
Ain't nothin you can do about it
It's been too long, this is too strong
Cause we belong here
Baby, we're stuck with each other
Stuck with each other
Stuck in love with each other
(Stuck in love with each other)
(In love with each other)
[Akon]
Yeah
Now I can say that I would not care
If you were not there
Tell myself that I'll be fine without ya
But I would die if I was not around ya
And I can, try to convince you
I don't need to be with you
But my only thoughts are thoughts about ya
What can I do, love is like glue
There's no way to
Tear us a part

[Chorus]
Cause it's too late, there's no escape
Might as well face it
Baby we're stuck with each other
Stuck with each other
Ain't nothin you can do about it
It's been too long, this is too strong
Cause we belong here
Baby, we're stuck with each other
Stuck with each other
Stuck in love with each other
(Stuck in love with each other)
(In love with each other)

[Bridge: Shontelle]
There's nothing I'd rather do
Than to sit with you forever
Can't think of nothin' better
Than being stuck with you
Cause it's too late, there's no escape
Might as well face it
Baby we're stuck with each other
Stuck with each other
Ain't nothin' we can do about it
Oh yeah
Cause it's too late, there's no escape
Might as well face it
Baby we're stuck with each other
Stuck with each other
Ain't nothin you can do about it
It's been too long, this is too strong
Cause we belong here
Baby, we're stuck with each other
Stuck with each other
Stuck in love with each other
(Stuck in love with each other)
(In love with each other)
(x2)
Ain't nothin' gonna stop me and you eh
Cause you know we just stuck like glue eh
Ain't nothin we can do
We stuck in love with each other
