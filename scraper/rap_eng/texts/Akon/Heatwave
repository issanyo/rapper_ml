[Verse 1]
Try so hard to get away
Think about you every day
Try so hard to live without
But no, no más
Sun shine is shining far away
Birds eyes just looking out
And they can see that you’re, you’re mine

[Pre-Chorus]
‘Cause when we’re together, your love is controlling my brain
Like plunging inside of that fire I cannot contain

[Chorus]
Our love is like a heatwave
It’s burning through the evening rain
Sets sail out on an ocean wave
‘Cause our love is like a heatwave
‘Cause our love is like a heatwave

[Verse 2]
I never will walk away
Unless you’re right by my side
Burn gas in the Chevrolet
She’s so hot
And our connection’s like Wi-Fi
Just love how you ricochet
Won’t stop ’til you’re satisfied

[Pre-Chorus]
‘Cause when we’re together, your love is controlling my brain
Like plunging inside of that fire I cannot contain

[Chorus]
Our love is like a heatwave
It’s burning through the evening rain
Sets sail out on an ocean wave
‘Cause our love is like a heatwave
Heatwave heatwave heatwave
‘Cause our love is like a heatwave

[Bridge]
Strong current won’t stop you
Just makes me want you more
Couldn’t leave if I want to
I wash up at your door
I know at times, we break the rules
Temperatures rise when I’m with you

[Chorus]
Our love is a heatwave
It’s burning through the evening rain
Sets sail out on an ocean wave
‘Cause our love is like a heatwave
Heatwave heatwave heatwave
‘Cause our love is like a heatwave
