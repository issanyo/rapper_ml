(Verse 1 - Colby O'Donis)
I know that you be workin 9 to 5 girl
Gotta act professional, but you too fly girl
Too fine to be taken s*** for granted from any guys girl
So tell me why do you stay

Baby you should be ( you should be)
Not breakin your back, workin endlessly
You should chase your dreams ( chase your dreams )
You should chase your dreams ( chase your dreams )
Baby i should be ( i should be)
The guy that provides all your needs
Im behind yor dreams ( behind your dreams )
110 you'll see

( Chorus - Colby O'Donis And Girlicious)
(Baby dont turn back, dont look back)
You stressin up, ain't your love
(Dont turn back, dont look back)
Cause im done, found a way
(Baby dont turn back, dont look back)
Visulise a kite in the sky, be amazed
That what you think and see, i'll make reality

(Dont turn back)
Oh oh oh
(Dont turn back)
Dont go
(Dont turn back )
All i can say, is just look away

(Verse 2 - Colby O'Donis)
Now i know you think im crazy, but im bout girl
The only things that make you happy, scratch the frowns girl
Cause a princess in your form, without a crown girl
I felt that i had to say

Baby you should be ( you should be)
Not breakin your back, workin endlessly
You should chase your dreams ( chase your dreams )
You should chase your dreams ( chase your dreams )
Baby i should be ( i should be)
The guy that provides all your needs
Im behind yor dreams ( behind your dreams )
110 you'll see

( Chorus - Colby O'Donis And Girlicious)
(Baby dont turn back, dont look back)

You stressin up, ain't your love
(Dont turn back, dont look back)
Cause im done, found a way
(Baby dont turn back, dont look back)
Visulise a kite in the sky, be amazed
That what you think and see, i'll make reality

(Dont turn back)
Oh oh oh
(Dont turn back)
Dont go
(Dont turn back )
All i can say, is just look away

Baby only, baby only in time you'll see
Its your choice who you wanna be
The reality sets in
You realize that your free
Free from all the pain and cries
Even things that make you sigh

( I, I, I got you )
Oh i got you babygirl
( I got You)
Said i got you babygirl
( I got you)

Baby you should be ( you should be)
Not breakin your back, workin endlessly
You should chase your dreams ( chase your dreams )
You should chase your dreams ( chase your dreams )
Baby i should be ( i should be)
The guy that provides all your needs
Im behind yor dreams ( behind your dreams )
110 you'll see

( Chorus - Colby O'Donis And Girlicious)
(Baby dont turn back, dont look back)
You stressin up, ain't your love
(Dont turn back, dont look back)
Cause im done, found a way
(Baby dont turn back, dont look back)
Visulise a kite in the sky, be amazed
That what you think and see, i'll make reality
