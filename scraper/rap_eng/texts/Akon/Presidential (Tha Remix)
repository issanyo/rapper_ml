[Bridge: Sean Paul & Akon]
I tote that thing, nah mean
Hat lean, clothes smell like green
And some white tees and white rees
About bread real G's get cheese
Back to the streets, back with (Akon)
Back for the A, reppin' for the slums
Put ya hood up show a nigga where ya from
And if they hate that then get the job done

[Chorus: Akon & Sean Paul]
Hey, I'm sure you know my steez
Rollin' presidential through ya hood like G's
Gotcha higher than Chris Tucker
Sittin' in my Cutlass system beatin' like a motherfucker, hey
But we smoke, that kush (Uh huh)
(Oh, oh, oh uh huh) Presidential shit, George Bush
(Yeah) How we do it (Uh huh)
(Oh, oh, oh uh huh) Get crunk, big big, big, big (Hey)

[Verse 1: J-Bo]
Sixteen, I'ma give it to ya raw
Take it to ya ass, slap ya clean cross the jaw (cross the jaw)
Now where they at where they, you want some
See I don't think y'all really want none (want none)
See I'm back with a whole new clip
With a badass chick, on some brand new shit (new shit)
Now put 'em up (put 'em up) to the sky (to the sky)
Get buck, get drunk, get high (get high)
Shake 'em off, ya know what to do
Take it to the floor, call out ya whole crew (whole crew)
Like what (what), knuck if ya buck
See we still don't give a damn and I never gave a fuck
See I'm big timin' wrists stay blindin'
With four or five freaks, and my pinky ring shinin'
I stay grindin' and true to the streets
If you ever need to find me then you know where we can meet

[Chorus: Akon & Sean Paul]
Hey, I'm sure you know my steez
Rollin' presidential through ya hood like G's
Gotcha higher than Chris Tucker
Sittin' in my Cutlass system beatin' like a motherfucker, hey
But we smoke, that kush (Uh huh)
(Oh, oh, oh uh huh) Presidential shit, George Bush
(Yeah) How we do it (Uh huh)
(Oh, oh, oh uh huh) Get crunk, big big, big, big (Hey)

[Verse 2: Sean Paul]
I build big bank (big bank) and drank drank (drank drank)
That's why I got a purple Sprite, and y'all ain't (y'all ain't)
I ride big rims (big rims), sittin' this tall (this tall)
So when ya step down, baby girl don't fall (don't fall)
Y'all niggas know the name (name), they call me Sean Paul (Sean Paul)
And I ain't got no flaws, except breakin' the laws (the laws)
Niggas call me dope, cause I'm hard and I'm raw
Can call me that fiend, one hit'll make ya cough
It's always beside me, watch got diamonds
I ain't part timin', I'm full time grindin'
The nigga wasn't shinin' live nigga blindin'
I'm with niggas with the dimes in the whips I be ridin'
And I don't pull 'em out, until the trunk beat (beat)
And ya can see ya movie sittin' in the back seat
They wild on the east, they live in these streets
So I'ma keep my piece sittin' on the front seat (front seat)

[Chorus: Akon & Sean Paul]
Hey, I'm sure you know my steez
Rollin' presidential through ya hood like G's
Gotcha higher than Chris Tucker
Sittin' in my Cutlass system beatin' like a motherfucker, hey
But we smoke, that kush (Uh huh)
(Oh, oh, oh uh huh) Presidential shit, George Bush
(Yeah) How we do it (Uh huh)
(Oh, oh, oh uh huh) Get crunk, big big, big, big (Hey)
