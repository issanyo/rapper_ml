[Intro: Pitbull]
Yo le doy le que pide
Tell me mamita dime
Go ahead baby see it, see it
Esso me gusta, feel it
Mr. WW, 305
Afrojack, budda
Put it down, con Chris carmelito

[Hook: Chris Brown]
I'm fuckin' faded

[Verse 1: Pitbull]
You don't know who you're messin' with
Go getter, I'm good at gettin' it
It's a movement, I don't know if you get it
But you can but your ass, if she's bad she's gettin' it
Get it? Get it? Got it, got iT
Sexy, erotice
El carito mio, she ride it
Dale Chris Brown put it down for the pound

[Verse 2: Chris Brown]
East side, simmer down
It's too late 'cause we in here now
Are you in or out?
Take this here ,put it in your mouth
Pretty tits in her blouse
If you're not on the list, we gon' kick you out
Amazin', amazin'
Another round of loud, still blazin'

[Hook: Akon]
Bring me the love
Oh, make me feel alive
Live like you're gonna die
Take a walk on the wild side
I'm fuckin' faded

[Verse 2: Pitbull]
Now I'm seein' double
That mean she got 4 tig ol' bitties, trouble
And her booty lookin' like a bubble
If you got that voli rollin
Rollin'
You don't have to know me
Just to show me what I wanna see
Ain't that that Breezy?

[Verse 3: Chris Brown]
Yeah, you're quite entertainin'
I think I might just detain it
Money, money, I throw out, it's rainin'
Spray bottles in your face, rainin'
Bottles in the air, what it look like?
You're f*cked up, yeah 'cause it shook right
Amazin', amazin'
Another round of loud, still blazin'

[Hook: Chris Brown, Akon, & Pitbull]
Bring me the love
Oh, make me feel alive
Live like you're gonna die
Take a walk on the wild side
Bring me the love
Oh, make me feel alive
Live like you're gonna die
Take a walk on the wild side
On the wild side, on the wild side
Take a walk on the wild side
Welcome to the wild side
Welcome to the wild side
I'm fuckin' faded
Bring me the love
Oh, make me feel alive
Live like you're gonna die
Take a walk on the wild side
I'm fuckin' faded
