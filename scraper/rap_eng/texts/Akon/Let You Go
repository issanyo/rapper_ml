Konvict, Konvict, Konvict

It’s so hard to let you go
Hey mmhmm yah

I’m not so good at breakin’ up
But I’m so good at makin’ up
Why don’t
Baby you make this easy it’s uncomfortable
And I’m the type of guy
Who would hate to see you cry
So it is wise, I’m not leavin’ your side

Could it be I am thinkin’ to much
Hopin’ for a better day (a better day, a better day)
Oh, girl I’ve been tryin’ to stay
I don’t know what to do
You’re everything I know, It’s so hard to let you go
I’m not tryin’ to break your heart
But this ain’t fair to you
You’re everything I know, It’s so hard to let you go
Hard to let you go it’s so hard to let you go hard to let you go

Hey, I’m wastin’ time
You’ll be my best friend
I won’t die till end
You see if I turn back, If I look back
We could start over again
We could start just only friends
Just you an I, you and I

Could it be I am thinkin’ to much
Hopin’ for a better day (a better day, a better day)
Oh, girl I’ve been tryin’ to stay
I don’t know what to do
You’re everything I know, It’s so hard to let you go
I’m not tryin’ to break your heart
But this ain’t fair to you
You’re everything I know, It’s so hard to let you go
Hard to let you go it’s so hard to let you go hard to let you go

If you feel what I says
Feelin’ this song
Feel free to sing along
You’ll say oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh

And If you’re hurtin’ inside
Feelin’ so wrong
Feel free to sing along
You’ll say oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh

Oh, girl I’ve been tryin’ to stay
I don’t know what to do
You’re everything I know, It’s so hard to let you go
I’m not tryin’ to break your heart
But this ain’t fair to you
You’re everything I know, It’s so hard to let you go
Hard to let you go it’s so hard to let you go hard to let you go
It’s so hard to let you go hard to let you go It’s so hard to let you go hard to let you go It’s so hard to let you go
