[Intro: Kabaka Pyramid]
Kabaka P yeah

From the motherland

Africans arise

Keep hope alive
And be the eye in the storm, yeh

[Verse 1: Kabaka Pyramid]
I beg you please excuse me
If you're not an African child
Stop diggin' up we African soil
Crimes weh dem do to we, we have it pon file
Them kill of Ghaddafi fi we African oil
Conflict diamonds, ebola, syphillis
Missionaries but we don't know what dem mission is
Politicians giving fo'fo's to the little kids
Still the possibilities limitless

[Chorus: Kabaka Pyramid]
Africans arise
And be strong, yeh
Keep hope alive
And be the eye in the storm, yeh

Africans arise
And be strong, yeh
Keep hope alive
And be the eye in the storm, yeh

[Verse 2: Kabaka Pyramid]
Huh
Mama Africa she wear the pain of the world on her shoulders
And she never complain
And even through the modernisation effort
She still keeps her ancient traditions the same
The metropolitan cities bright and beautiful
But be mindful not destroy the landscape cah
No matter your religion
Or national division
Cyaa out this ya burning flame

[Chorus: Kabaka Pyramid & Akon]
Africans arise
And be strong, yeh
Keep hope alive
And be the eye in the storm, yeh

Africans arise
And be strong, yeh
Keep hope alive (hope alive)
And be the eye in the storm, yeh

[Verse 3: Akon]
Akon!
Me see the ghetto every time I pass by (pass by)
These little youth dying and they don't know why (ay)
Them holding on to the piece of the pie
Because let it take men then light it on fire
Oh
Cause I will bleed and will fight you for it (yeah)
And I won't neglect my [?] (no)
And I respect me from morning (yeah)
And if you is a soldier you know this
Cause I [?] my life
Just to get through the night (to get through the night)
I barely survived (barely survived)
Just tryin to do it right (do it right)

[Chorus: Kabaka Pyramid & Akon]
Africans arise (uh yeh)
And be strong, yeh (oh)
Keep hope alive (hope alive)
And be the eye in the storm, yeh (yeah)

Africans arise (uh, rise)
And be strong, yeh (oo)
Keep hope alive (ah)
And be the eye in the storm, yeh (yeah)
