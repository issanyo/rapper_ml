Wake up, I put on my makeup
They wanna blow me, blow me, blow me kisses
Hey bitches, if you want the riches
Then you should come, come come along with me now

Every day like Charlie Sheen
Blacked out cause a scene
Wasted in my limousine

Woah oh oh ooh oh!

Every night like Jersey Shore
Passed out on the floor
An now you wanna be a whore

I hope I remember all this in the morning
I hope I remember cuz all I know is
Tonight is the best night ever, best night ever-ever
Best night ever, best night ever-ever
Best night ever, best night ever-ever
Best night ever, best night ever-ever

Oh shit, whiskey so delicious
Swallow it down, downâ€¦ get another round
Wait! hold up! She about to throw up
No shame, turn around and tongue you down (OKKK!!!)

Every day like Charlie Sheen
Blacked out cause a scene
Wasted in my limousine

Woah oh oh ooh oh!

Every night like Jersey Shore
Passed out on the floor
An now you wanna be a whore

I hope I remember all this in the morning
I hope I remember cuz all I know is
Tonight is the best night ever, best night ever-ever
