[Intro: Verse Simmonds, Pitbull & (Akon)]
I could just be in my feelings, yeah, yeah
I could just be in my feelings, yeah, yeah
It's been a while, papo, haha
(Akon)
I could just be in my feelings
Now let's do what we do best
Situation is fleeting
(Verse, yeah)
Let's take over the world
(Oh, yeah)
Mr. Worldwide
I could just be in my feelings, yeah, yeah
Verse on the remix, the remix
Ayo Jay

[Verse 1: Verse Simmonds]
All in my feelings
Baby got me all in my feelings
Used to be the one she used to call for the lovey dovey
Now she got another nigga in it
You know I try
To be the one in your life
To say I never loved you, that's a lie, lie, lie
Every day I miss when you were mine, mine, mine
Shawty got the hoops in, pretty with the titty
Haitian and Cuban, girl, you too litty
Whenever we touch, roll shut down city
Now I'm all alone 'cause you ain't here with me

[Verse 2: Pitbull]
These boys act like they hard
Knowin' that pussy make the world go round
Always talkin' 'bout they hit your broad
Knowin' that the woman is the first to go down
I'm talkin' these boys more bitches than bitches
While I'm under bitches with bitches and all of them mad
Hittin' everythin' that they pitchin'
Ain't no need to be mad, grow up and be a man lil' boy
Keep messin' with them
Little Instagram or Snapchat stragglers
Think it's a game? Let's play
And get your ass stuck up like Kim K

[Pre-Chorus: Verse Simmonds]
I don't know how you put these feelings on this plate
I've gotten too used to doing things my own way
Oh, you're not mine, so why are we fighting this time?
Maybe I'm lying and I care more than I try

[Chorus: Verse Simmonds]
I could just be in my feelings, yeah, yeah
I could just be in my feelings, yeah, yeah
I could just be in my feelings, situation is fleeting
You got me in my feelings, yeah, yeah

[Verse 3: Akon]
(Let's keep it real, man)
I know we always say that we don't love these hoes
But we do, do, do, do, do, we do, do, do, do, do
I know we always say that we don't love these hoes
But we do, do, do, do, do, we do, do, do, do, do
We be all in our feelings
Switching 'em up like we dealing
Up until we get grade
Usually we be the ones that be playing
But eventually, lady
Spending more time with my baby
'Cause I can't stand the thought of another
Just touching her, sexing her crazy
Like na, na, na, na, na
Rubbing that kitty like na, na, na, na, na
Wanna get with me 'cause I'm type to fuck her with money and show her a good time
Send her right back to her hunny bunny, wishing that she was mine

[Chorus: Verse Simmonds]
I could just be in my feelings, yeah, yeah
I could just be in my feelings, yeah, yeah
I could just be in my feelings, situation is fleeting
You got me in my feelings, yeah, yeah

[Verse 4: Ayo Jay]
(Ayo Jay)
In my feelings
Oh, girl, you fucked up
I know you want me to nut up
I remember those times we used to
Want it
But now you walked up
Don't run across the west side, girl, you wanna
Don't forget I gave you money for the laptop
Girl, do you remember when I put that smile up on your face?
Do you remember when I wiped those tears up off your face?
In December, I came and shoveled the snow away
'Cause forever, I'm there for you to be my bae
'Cause I gave you the keys to my house
Went and took you to Porto
And whenever you act like a rebel
You go on and call me daddy
Every day, it is on you
Got me feeling this way
Either it's the truth I'm tryna say
Or I could just be in my

[Chorus: Verse Simmonds & Ayo Jay]
In my feelings, yeah, yeah
I could just be in my feelings, yeah, yeah
I could just be in my feelings, situation is fleeting
You got me in my feelings, yeah, yeah
In my feelings, yeah, yeah
I could just be in my feelings, yeah, yeah
I could just be in my feelings, you know the situation is fleeting
You got me in my feelings, yeah, yeah
