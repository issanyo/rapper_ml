(Intro) (Akon)
Streets!
This One Goes Out To The Struggle
Gregstreet Akon, And Imma Can't Scramble Words

[Bridge] (Akon)
Even When You Feel Like Your Hope Is Gone
And You Stuck At The End Of The Road
Keep Going You Can, Whether The Storm
And Don't Fall

Stay Strong, Stay Strong

Your Unstoppable
Unstoppable (Unstoppable)

Just Stay Strong, Stay Strong

[Verse 1][Beenie Man]
Come On
Praising Never Stop Me
Bullet Never Stood On That Momentum When They Shot Me
I Leave 'em When That Vipers, And The * Coming At Me
Never No Fear Because That See I Got The
Higher Nither Friends Of Fear
So Let Them See, They Shot Me
Would They Made Me Defensive
Missing Even Tryna Drop Me
Than Better Got Front For Significance
That All Life At Me
Pocket Full Of Greens Like Rock Cliff
Hover Look That Sit & Sleeping In That Tree
Show You From The Way, To Overcome
Bend To That And Marching Like Soldier Gun
Ricket People Wants To See That Roller Gun
Tell'em To Trust Me If I Have To Hold A Gun
Make Me Once Speak Out Loud,Laugh And Show The Gun
Do They Ask To Make A Fool Of
I Think They Want To Run
Holla! See That Smoke And Drink A Cola-Bun
I Don't Bought My Misery's And Some More I Got
Oh-My-My

[Bridge] (Akon)
Even When You Feel Like Your Hope Is Gone
And You Stuck At The End Of The Road
Keep Going You Can, Whether The Storm
And Don't Fall

[Chorus] (Akon)
Your Unstoppable
Unstoppable (Unstoppable)
Unstoppable (Unstoppable)
Unstoppable
Stay Strong, Stay Strong

Your Unstoppable
Unstoppable (Unstoppable)
Unstoppable (Unstoppable)
Unstoppable
Just Stay Strong, Stay Strong
