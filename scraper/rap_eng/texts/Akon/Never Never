[Intro]
(Konvict)
Oh, no, no, no, no

[Hook]
You can pop ya collar, thinkin' you gon get it
Touch me with cha dollar thinkin' you gon get it
Keep your money, I got it too, you just don't get it
Show me your A game, you betta come with it

[Verse 1]
Cause I be riddin, switchin' lanes, crusin' real slow
Workin' up the fast lane, puffin' on dro
You're lookin' like I'm the one that cha wanna get to know
Until you get the green light it's not cha time to go
So ya...

[Chorus]
Never, never, never, never gon get it
Never, never, never, never gon get it
I might think about it if you treat me like a lady
I might think about it and you just might get it
Never, never, never, never gon get it
Never, never, never, never gon get it
I might think about it if you treat me like a lady
I might think about it and you just might get it

[Verse 2]
Cause all you fellas be trippin'
Everybody frontin' like dey pimpin'
Cause I can guarantee you
I can do it better than you
I'm not for fakin' or pretendin'
I be in the club with my girls stayin' low
Fellas rubbin' all up on me tryna get close
Wantin' to unwrap me like a candy in a store
Until I give the green, goodie bag stays closed, yeah

[Hook]
You can pop ya collar, thinkin' you gon get it
Touch me with cha dollar thinkin' you gon get it
Keep your money, I got it too, you just don't get it
Show me your A game, you betta come with it

[Chorus]
Never, never, never, never gon get it
Never, never, never, never gon get it
I might think about it if you treat me like a lady
I might think about it and you just might get it
Never, never, never, never gon get it
Never, never, never, never gon get it
I might think about it if you treat me like a lady
I might think about it and you just might get it

[Bridge]
Keep up, if your going slow then ya better speed up
If ya get the chance then don't freeze up
Come with it, babe, you know you got to bring it
Can ya swing it?
Can ya dig it?
If you can't, ease up

[Hook]
You can pop ya collar, thinkin' you gon get it
Touch me with cha dollar thinkin' you gon get it
Keep your money, I got it too, you just don't get it
Show me your A game, you betta come with it

[Chorus]
Never, never, never, never gon get it
Never, never, never, never gon get it
I might think about it if you treat me like a lady
I might think about it and you just might get it
Never, never, never, never gon get it
Never, never, never, never gon get it
I might think about it if you treat me like a lady
I might think about it and you just might get it
Never, never, never, never gon get it
Never, never, never, never gon get it
I might think about it if you treat me like a lady
I might think about it and you just might get it
Never, never, never, never gon get it
Never, never, never, never gon get it
I might think about it if you treat me like a lady
I might think about it and you just might get it
