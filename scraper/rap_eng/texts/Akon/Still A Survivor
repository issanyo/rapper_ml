Yeah! Still a Rider!
A Sole Survivor!
Your back is up against the wall and there nowhere to turn
You can feel the heat from the fire burn
There’s nowhere to run and you’re down to the wire
Remember that you still a rider, still a rider
Still a survivor, a sole survivor!
Remember that you're still a rider, still a rider
And that's all I ever been known to be
Post up under them city lights and you know I got that thing on me
Ready in case they bang on me try to plug and put a blood stain on me
If it go down in history nigga don't forget to label me
Rider
Even though we struggling trying find ways to double it
Cuz in the hood nigga we bubbling
Funny how people love it when our community is crumbling
If you keep up on stumbling
We'll end up under that shoveling
Survivor
That’s what I’ll always be!
Might of had to move candy but believe money I'm so sucker free
AK I load that 8K I throw that
State case I closed that so what you do when
Your back is up against the wall and there's no where to turn
You can feel the heat from the fire burn
There's no where to run and you're down to wire
Remember that you're still a rider, still a rider
Still a survivor, a sole survivor!
Remember that you're still a rider, still a rider
Just like my niggas that really never made it home
Been in and out of state getting that money
Trying they best just find their family
No matter what hustle going
We'll find a way to get up on it
Gotta put that muscle on it
Stand on the corner till the morning
Rider
Like everybody in the hood
Did it when nobody thought you could
I see you my nigga whats good gripping leather and wood
9 mille hidden under the hood
Get the rich and give to the pour
Like a modern day Robin Hood
Survivor
That’s what I’ll always be!
Might of had to move candy but believe money I'm so sucker free
AK I load that 8K I throw that
State case I closed that so what you do when
Your back is up against the wall and there's on where to turn
You can feel the heat from the fire burn
There's no where to run and you're down to wire
Remember that you're still a rider, still a rider
Still a survivor, a sole survivor!
Remember that you're still a rider, still a rider
Keep on riding and do what you got to do for surviving
Keep on riding and do what you got to do to keep on providing
Rider just keep on survivor

Come on let me hear you sing it
So what you do when
Your back is up against the wall and theres son where to turn
You can feel the heat from the fire burn
Theres no where to run and youre down to wire
Remember that you're still a rider, still a rider
Still a survivor, a sole survivor!
Remember that you're still a rider, still a rider
