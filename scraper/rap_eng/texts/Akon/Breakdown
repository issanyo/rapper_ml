Konvict... Yeah....Yeah
You found the soujla
But I’m a man of peace
I fight for your love
They thraten to take it me from me
Then protect your heart so you never be hurt again
But it’s a sacrifice cause I’m an old fashion working man
Which means I won’t be home like I use to
On the phone like I use to
Won’t be long for see you too
Yeeah
We live with no fears
And you never disappear, you showed me how much you care
You was never insecure, I love the fact you let me live and you
Then you help me down for years
The hardest part from here it’s when you cry
I’m not there to wipe your tears
So baby don’t breakdown, hold me now, I need your love too
Make it back all, I don’t know how I’ll do with out you
So baby don’t breakdown over now, I need your love too
Make it back all, I don’t know how I’ll do with out you
With out you, I’ll do with out you
With out you, I’ll do with out you
With out you, I’ll do with out you
With out you, I’ll do with out you
Can’t do with out your love, your love, your love
Can’t do with out your
Love
I know you hear the rumors, I know you hear the lies
I know you hear than I’m no different for all this others guys
I wanna come home sooner
To make you realize that life’s just a context and you have been to take my price
We live with no fears
And you never disappear, you showed me how much you care
You was never insecure, I love the fact you let me live and you
Then you help me down for years
The hardest part from here it’s when you cry
I’m not there to wipe your tears
So baby don’t breakdown, hold me now, I need your love too
Make it back all, I don’t know how I’ll do with out you
So baby don’t breakdown over now, I need your love too
Make it back all, I don’t know how I’ll do with out you
With out you, I’ll do with out you
With out you, I’ll do with out you
With out you, I’ll do with out you
With out you, I’ll do with out you
Can’t do with out your love

You found the the soujla
But I’m a man in a piece
I fight for your love
They try to take it me from you
Then protect your heart so you never be hurt again
But it’s a sacrifice cause I’m an old fashion working man
Witch means I won’t be home like who you use to
