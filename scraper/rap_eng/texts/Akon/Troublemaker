[Hook: Akon]
Most stared up in the club, just swagging doing my thang
Popping bottles with models and just watching them drank
Partying so hard, the ladies don't want it to end
They looked at me and said, "I heard that you're a heartbreaker"

Baby I'm a troublemaker, I heard that you're a heartbreaker
Baby I'm a troublemaker, I heard that you're a heartbreaker
Baby I'm a troublemaker, I heard that you're a heartbreaker
Baby I'm a troublemaker

[Verse 1: Akon]
See, I'm that type of guy you won't love
I'm that type of guy you won't cuff
I'm that type of guy your daddy won't let you go out
Cause he thinks I sell drugs

I'm that type of guy that will save ya
I'm that type that will call you later
Won't be around to give you that time
Gotta get on the grind and get to that paper
That I can do

Gotta keep my baby girl laced in the latest and the fliest suits
Never one for none, let's stay caked up, hold it down, that's all you gotta do
Then I walk up in the place, with a pocket full of money, my brother like I are the dude
Stepping out with the finest suits, look at me now

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Akon]
See I'm that type of guy that like kissing
I'm that type that will pop the clip and
I'm that type of guy that put you in your place
If your bougie just start tripping

I'm that type that will let you go
I'm that type that will let you know
That everywhere I go I can find a pretty ho
But there ain't too many know how to get that dough

That's the type of girl I want around me
Even though I'm a with her, make a man feel free
Roll with the fellas, even hold my cheese
Look like something you would see on TV

She don't mind climbing up that ladder
Similar to the words, it don't matter
But this time they wanna see us together
Look at us now

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Akon]
You're not for sure
Even though I wanna take you everywhere I go
Because of you, all the girls is staring, taking notes
And I realize being with you girls bring more girls
And that's just what I'm attracted to

And I'd rather go all the way
Love her long time, till the break of day
I won't let her ever leave my bed
Till she sees the color purple like Anna Mae
Now she wants to start holding on me, like whatever she's smoking on
I'll be long gone before you can say, "Look at me now"

[Hook]
