Yeah.. (up front)
Its the one bele..
Akon and Glasses.. uh huh.. Konvict music.. Akon and glasses... uh huh
Niggas spit fairy tales, G issues the facts
Not Jeezy, but I sold my fair issue of crack
Not Weezy, but Malone got that hustla's music and them hustla's use it
Serve customers to it
Went from two to three hundred got them mexicans down
Hundred Crip, hundred blood, hundred mexicans now
Hundred round in the clip, man you wanna get done
With these new west bread on these eight town drums
With these new west bread daddy call in a play
When we sackin' whack rappers niggas call it a day
Down south, call them choppers dont call it a k
Either way ambulances come and haul 'em away
It's Luda-vision bitch, I'm the soul of the crew
Hundred girls on my heels like the sole of my shoe
Got tupe in the kitchen, let it simmer and cook
Now Kon break it on down and deliver the hook!
(let's go)
I ain't for all that beef-ay, got niggas to bust ya head for no reason
Ask around the streets man I'm certified
Cross seas all my customers are satisfied
See I ain't for all that beef
Ay matter a fact I'm just tryin' to chill with the squeeze-ay
Ask around the hood man I'm certified
Now I'd hate to have to put a bullet in ya mind
Got the bloods on my team who gonna fuck with cuz
I'm heavy in the street nigga fuck the club
I make g's bouncin wanna buck the snubs
Takin down everyday you spendin bucks to plug
I was jus' a lil pissed I didn't sign with Jay
(?Mil clus?) couple months feelin fine today
(?Mil clus?) couple blunts they say runnin the hood
And I'm laughin at you rap niggas runnin from Shug (Knight)
Talk greezy on your records stop pushin' me hoe
Face to face turned bitch, your lil pussy's exposed
You a mark, I'm a G. So when you pop your checks
You could buy any car but not the streets respect
One of few gangsta rappers that the street respects
And blacks and nothin less then what the streets expect
Got tupe in the kitchen, let it simmer and cook
Now kon break it on down and deliver the hook!
(let's go)
I ain't for all that beef-ay, got niggas to bust ya head for no reason

Cross seas all my customers are satisfied
See I ain't for all that beef
Ay matter a fact im just tryin to chill with the squeeze-ay
Ask around the hood man im certified
Now I'd hate to have to put a bullet in ya mind
Wassup lil momma, wassup
Wassup lil momma, wassup
Wassup lil momma, wassup
You won't find another nigga spittin beastier shit
I'm hot in the west, hot in the south
Fuck bars, nigga often puttin' Glocks in your mouth
Fuck bars, Its the flow so easy and smooth
Charismatic on the mic like easy the Q
No attitude though, fuck stoppin' the grind
No whitey in my mix, homie robbin me blind
Go hyphy in this bitch, the only problem is time
Cuz my bentley watch broke, but got the properly shine
In the base model 5, put the (?brobers?) in line
Once I made back ends, its the Maybach Benz
Got tupe in the kitchen, let it simmer and cook
Now kon break it on down and deliver the hook!
(let's go)
