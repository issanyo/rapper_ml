Losing It

I'm Losing It, I'm Losing it
She got me, she got me, got me
She got me, she got me gone

I'm Losing It, I'm Losing it
She got me, she got me, got me
She got me, she got me gone

She got my mind blown
I feel like I'm gone
Way outta my head, did ya hear wat I said?
It's with the lights on, and with the lights off
I know I'm kickin' , she's so, that I don't even care
I'm not her type but I don't ever listen to it
They said, don't waste my time, i continue to do it
She is super hot, gotta get her, I bet im not
Girl, I just won't stop, you even know

It's been so long long long loonng
All I do is stare, her lips are strong strong strong stronngg
I didn't know it there, so am i wrong wrong wrong wronng
Forgettin of the past, she got me gone gone gone gonnee
She don't even care

I'm Losing It, I'm Losing it
She got me, she got me, got me
She got me, she got me gone
[x4]

What am I gunna do now?
My heart ain't makin a sound
Count everybeat whenever this girl come come around

She's so intreging
She got me day dreamn'
Each and everytime I see her, see I count the feelin

Anytime that I see her pretty face,pretty face
And the way she swing her hips on her waist, on her waist
Oh girl you take me to a whole other place
And the feelings just won't go away, girl

It's been so long long long loonng
All I do is stare, her lips are strong strong strong stronngg
I didn't know it there, so when im wrong wrong wrong wronng
Forgettin of the past, she got me gone gone gone gonnee
She don't even care

I'm Losing It, I'm Losing it
She got me, she got me, got me
She got me, she got me gone
[x4]

Girl you are fire, oo you are burnin' up
You really take me higher when you turn me up
Girl you are fire, oo you are burnin' up
You really take me higher when you turn me up
Girl you are fire, oo you are burnin' up
You really take me higher when you turn me up

I'm Losing It, I'm Losing it
She got me, she got me, got me
She got me, she got me gone
