[Intro]
Oh (Fuego)
Oh, oh (Hey)
Oh (Sweat)
(Hey, hey) Oh, oh
Oh (Akon)
Esto es pa' las nenas salvajes
Hey ya, hey
Pa' to' el mundo

[Verse 1: Akon]
She wants to impress somebody now
So she movin' through the city with her body out
She knows how to make ya really feel good
But won't go without the money now
Booty too big for her to do run-run
Wish they could try to pitch to her, but she won't come
And I can see you watchin' while my money's in the air
And fallin' down, down, down
While that body's rollin' 'round, 'round, 'round
Now my heart is stolen
I can't take no more
When you movin' up on the floor
There's only one Latina, wet like Aquafina
Want to be between ya, so
Here we go

[Chorus]
Love ya, love ya body like dinero
(Me encanta como te mueves)
Girl you're so, so fire, fuego
(Acércate a mí)
Love ya, love ya body like dinero
Girl you're so, so fire, fuego

[Verse 2: Keith Sweat]
I love it when you come around and say, "Baby, let me dance"
And girl, you got a body that'd bring a freak out of any man
Got me spendin' all my money
Throwin' twenties and them hundreds
But you're somethin' money can't buy
What you givin' me tonight, I'm your lucky guy
It must be personal
Baby give me more and more
I ain't tryin' to let you go
But you don't seem to want let me know, oh baby
You can do it like you wanna do, baby
Hey, girl, I ain't tryna go crazy
Baby, work your body just the way I like
Just let me see you dance

[Verse 3]
Ella vive en el momento
A ella le canta, le canta rápido y lento
Sexo bien violento
Vente pal' safari, nos volvemos animales

[Chorus]
Love ya, love ya body like dinero
(Me encanta como te mueves)
Girl you're so, so fire, fuego
(Baby girl, you know I love you)
Love ya, love ya body like dinero, ayy
Girl you're so, so fire, fuego

[Verse 4: Alkaline]
One gyal alone a create pandemonium
About two grand in yah once me throw down
Girl you so perfect just to say the least
I want you to myself, bear with me please
Do anything except go on my knees
I don't want nobody else, you're all that I need, girl
If me and you a deal, keep it pon the low down
Anytime me lef' the stage, girl, the show done
She tell me she single, I do not believe
Grab on pon my body, no want you fi leave
Don't want nobody else, you're all that I need
Those other girls out there, they're not in your league, no
Quad gyal, nothing no wrong with that
But a real bad gyal no pay fi come back
'Mount of time me seh mi and you done chat
Pack your things and ready fi cut and haffi tun back
Because

[Chorus]
(Girl, you know I love you)
Love ya, love ya body like dinero
(Me encanta como te mueves)
Girl you're so, so fire, fuego
(I said goddamn me)
Love ya, love ya body like dinero, ayy
Girl you're so, so fire, fuego
Bring it back now

[Verse 1: Akon]
She wants to impress somebody now
