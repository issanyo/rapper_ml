Ooooo ooooo

(bridge)
Rain or shine
Sleet or snow
You're the reason why I ain't gon' go
Cause I'm playing mine
High and low
Ain't afraid of that whole world know


Hello, my love
I heard a kiss from you
Red magic satin playing near, too
All through the morning rain
I gaze - the sun doesn't shine
Rainbows and waterfalls run through my mind
In the garden - I see west
Purple showers, bells and tea
Orange birds and river cousins dressed in green
Pretty music I hear - so happy
And loud - blue flower echo
From a cherry cloud baby

(chorus)
A present from you
Strawberry Letter 22
A present from you - yeah
Strawberry Letter 22


(bridge)
Rain or shine
Sleet or snow
You're the reason why I ain't gon' go
Cause I'm playing mine
High and low
Ain't afraid of that whole world know


Feel sunshine sparkle pink and blue
Playgrounds will laugh if you try to ask
Is it cool?, is it cool?
If you arrive and don't see me
I'm going to be with my baby
I am free, I am free
Flying in her arms, over the sea
Stained window, yellow candy screen
See speakers of kite - velvet roses diggin' freedom flight
Ooo yeah

(chorus)
A present from you
Strawberry Letter 22
A present from you - yeah
Strawberry Letter 22

Rain or shine
Sleet or snow
You're the reason why I ain't gon' go
Cause I'm playing mine
High and low
Ain't afraid of that whole world know
