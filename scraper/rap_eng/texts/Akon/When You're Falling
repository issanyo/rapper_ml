Ooh baby

Oh oh baby

Oh yeah...

Baby we facing our death
Oh baby take your last breath
I see when you fall I fall too
I know what you see I know who you be
We need to fall together
If you fall I will change forever
My mood will change the weather
Oh baby I won't ever let you fa- fall

Oooh

Baby I won't let you fall
When you're falling
I'll save you always and forever

Please I fight at all
Oooh no no no

Ill send you my text
If you fall you'll be missed
Ill text you my last kissed
If you fa- fall
Who will be my prince to take me to the ball
Ooh baby who who who
I want you you and only you
When your falling apart
You can have my heart
Because...
