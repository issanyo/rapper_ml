Dont know about you my nigga but the street's been good to me
Even took a whole lotta bullshit but it made me a stronger G
Dont know nuttin else but the street life when it come to me
I never thought i'd ever think about bitin the hand that fed me
Look at me now
Lookin for a way to get off the block
I said look at me now
This life im livin must stop man
Look at me now
Think about it each and every day
Look at me now
Dont know about you my nigga but the street's been good to me
Even took a whole lotta bullshit but it made me a stronger G
Dont know nuttin else but the street life when it come to me
I never thought i'd ever think about bitin the hand that fed me
Look at me now
Lookin for a way to get off the block
I said look at me now
This life im livin must stop
Man, look at me now
Think about it each and every day
Look at me now
Just look at me now
[Obie Trice]
Obie Trice, real name no gimmicks
I came in the game profane, no image
I came in the game with a name i was given
From a man who didn't give a fuck about his legitamate
I proclaim the name though
Never in vain no
Watch the change grow
A young nigga who didn't gain from fame
Copped a range rov'
Now they want my brains on the main row
But they dont understand what i came for
I came forward, wit a million sold
Who say you can't grow from mildew and mold
Get money like Ross Perrault
Im often told, a coffins the routes i go
Oh thats the road you on, oh no
Im down for the rifle tone of faux faux
They'll never try to send a nigga home, no no
I know you wanna catch me at Sunoco
Show me that your loco, put hoes in my photo, NOPE!
Ope, hold toast no jokes since thugs beat the poli'
[Akon]
Stayin in im just gettin much older
Its time to go start puffin up trees
Hot Glocks just get much colder, dodgin and duckin the police
How much longer must I stand on this corner?
I Gotta get off right away
How much longer must me see sell on this corner before they take my life away?
Dont know about you my nigga but the street's been good to me
Even took a whole lotta bullshit but it made me a stronger G
