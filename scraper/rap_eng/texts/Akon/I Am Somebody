[Verse 1: Big K.R.I.T]
Country bumpkin this, country bumpkin that
I be damned if I prove them right
Pimp the pen and wrecked the mic
There ain't no stopping me baby I'm on my mission
Been that way since grandma kitchen, livin' conditions wasn't all that easy
I promised her before she up and left I'd make good on my talents
You can't fall if you balanced
Never stray from a challenge ever
And never be the type to give up on your dreams
Things ain't what they seem
So pay attention, play your position, and be a leader
Remember your scriptures, no matter the feat, the lost need ya
Reach they soul, break the mold, encourage your own folk out the gutter
The hood can't ever love ya like I love ya
Ain't no bubble they can put you in
Cause your accent hard
They might judge you by your skin
But they don't know your heart
The struggle of the ups and downs
Of being positive when negative is all around
Cause I am somebody

[Hook: Jesse Jackson + (Akon)]
I am somebody
(I am somebody)
I am somebody
(I am somebody)
I am somebody
(I am somebody)
I am somebody
(I am somebody)
I am somebody
(I am somebody)
I am somebody
I am somebody
I am somebody

[Verse 2: B.o.B]
I am more than just a color
To my niggas doin' time, you are more than just a number
To all of my amigos, I support you like a brother
Why they call it human race, are we competin' with each other?
Oh the world ain't fair, the world don't care
When the sun goes down, the world ain't there
Protect and serve what? Protect and serve who?
I am not the enemy, please don't shoot, hands up
It was all cool back when we was shootin' hoops
Now the streets ain't safe, man somebody call the troops
What happened to democracy?
Really it's the opposite
The neighborhood watch is the neighborhood watchin' me
Maybe it's cause these young niggas ain't got no one to chop it with
Fed up with the world, sick of wonderin' where their pops is at
All these trendin' topics, fuck the dollars, where the knowledge at?
And if you copy that then holler back
Let me hear you say, I am...

(I am somebody)
I am somebody

I am somebody
(I am somebody)
