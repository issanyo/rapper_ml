[Intro: Akon & Plies]
Konvict
Plies, Plies, Plies

[Chorus: Akon]
I see you winding and grinding up on that pole
I know you see me looking at you and you already know I wanna fuck you (fuck you)
You already know I wanna fuck you (fuck you)
You already know, girl

[Verse 1: Plies]
I wanna sit you in the donk, show you off to the goons
And show you what a real nigga with money do
I'm caked up and well respected with shit to prove
Be straight up with you, I wanna fuck you
I'm a street nigga, so you know I ain't got too many manors
Want you to bust it open so I can drop that dick in you
I'm thug and X-rated plus I'm a real nigga
I wanna lay in that pussy, I don't want your phone number
I wanna take you to the crib and fuck you to sleep
And let you get a little rest and wake you up beating
I bet a stack you ain't met a nigga fucked that ain't me
And how I'd beat you, you'd swear to God I was on three

[Chorus: Akon]
I see you winding and grinding up on that pole
I know you see me looking at you and you already know I wanna fuck you (fuck you)
You already know I wanna fuck you (fuck you)
You already know, girl

[Verse 2: Plies]
Let me fill you up with liquor and fuck it out you
And lay you flat on your back and get that noise out you
And feel it in your stomach, tell me how to back up out you
I wanna hear you moan, baby, I wanna hear you holler
Don't worry about your hairdo, I'll shoot you a few dollars
'Cause when you start riding me, get on them toes for me
I don't like a quiet fuck, so tell me how you want it
You need to act like it's your dick while you on it
I know I'm a freak, baby, and I'm loving that
Now I need to get you on the same level where I'm at
But when I get you out there, ain't no turning back
And I'ma take you from liking it to loving sex

[Chorus: Akon]
I see you winding and grinding up on that pole
I know you see me looking at you and you already know I wanna fuck you (fuck you)
You already know I wanna fuck you (fuck you)
You already know, girl

[Verse 3: Plies]
And if the pussy good, I'll fuck you a week straight
And meet you at the crib and fuck you on your lunch break
'Cause I'ma stay up in that pussy until you nut, bae
And put tears in your eyes and a smile on your face
Give me that pussy one time, that's all it take
And I'ma treat you like a big girl, okay?
And I can tell when you nut, I can see your legs shake
And at that point, I'ma give it to you all the way
'Cause I'ma make you wanna fuck me everyday
"Fuck me at your own risk" is what I'm trying to say
'Cause I'ma have your nose wide open after this
And make your panties get wet when you think about the dick
You wanna leave me alone but you can't quit
Whenever I ain't in that pussy, you feel sick
The more times I get it, the better it get
And next time you see me, think about this

[Chorus: Akon]
I see you winding and grinding up on that pole
I know you see me looking at you and you already know I wanna fuck you (fuck you)
You already know I wanna fuck you (fuck you)
You already know
I see you winding and grinding up on that pole
I know you see me looking at you and you already know I wanna fuck you (fuck you)
You already know I wanna fuck you (fuck you)
You already know, girl
