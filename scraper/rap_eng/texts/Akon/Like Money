I'm trying to show you how to touch me
I'm not just a girl
I'm more precious than pearls
And I deserve all you got babe

My heart is a treasure
One that can't be measured
Let me teach you how to love me

[Verse 2: Akon]
Stop listening to your friends
They just want your man
Misery loves a little company
Don't feed into them lies
Want you by my side
Why is it so hard to trust me?
Let go of your fears girl
Promise I'll be here girl
I won't let your heart skip a beat
I'll take care of you if you take care of me girl
Won't ever leave you lonely

[Verse 3: Yubin]
Look boy I've been through some things
Seen a little sunshine, seen a little rain
My heart's been through some pain
And I don't wanna go back through it again
So I'm letting you know upfront
If you plan on being the one
Listen to my instructions
Coz I'mma teach you how to love
(Love me like Love me like)
Hundred dollar bills, brand new wheels
(Love me like Love me like)
Fresh new haircut, boy I need you
(Love me like Love me like)
New pair of kicks, ice on your wrist
(Love me like Love me like Love me Love Love Love me Oh~)
