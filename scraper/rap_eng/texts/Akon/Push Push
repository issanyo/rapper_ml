[Intro: Kat DeLuna & Akon]
Kat Deluna
And Akon
Yeah, yeah, oh

[Verse 1: Kat DeLuna]
I see you dancin' with every girl
Lookin' for someone to rock your world
I'm checkin' your body, it's lookin' right
Boy, I can tell that you go all night

[Pre-Chorus: Kat DeLuna]
Sweet boy
I just wanna be your fantasy, boy
If you want it, boy
You gotta...

[Chorus: Kat DeLuna]
Push push baby
Don't stop for a minute
Oh oh, oh oh, ooh oh oh, oh oh oh
I said push push, baby
Take it to the limit

[Verse 2: Kat DeLuna]
Push it baby just the way I like (you know I want it)
Pick me up and take me for a ride (you know I want it)
Sexy body
Don't you wanna turn me out? (you know I want it)
When I hop into it
We take it to the crowd
Oh oh oh ohh

[Chorus: Kat DeLuna]
Push push baby
Don't stop for a minute
Oh oh, oh oh, ooh oh oh, oh oh oh
I said push push, baby
Take it to the limit

[Verse 3: Akon:]
Akon
I feel like I won the lottery with you
'Bout to go get my claim on
Damn, you look like a perfect picture
'Bout to go get my frame on
Lookin' like the type
I've been searchin' for to put my last name on
Come on closer
With your umbrella
Cause you're 'bout to get rained on

Clap it up, baby
Keep on clapping
Back it up
By the way you're stacking
Kat Deluna's now the captain
And Akon wanna know what's cracking

[Chorus: Kat DeLuna]
Push push baby
Don't stop for a minute
Oh oh, oh oh, ooh oh oh, oh oh oh
I said push push, baby
Take it to the limit
Oh oh, oh oh, ooh oh oh, oh oh oh
Push push baby
Don't stop for a minute
Oh oh, oh oh, ooh oh oh, oh oh oh
I said push push, baby
Take it to the limit
Oh oh, oh oh, ooh oh oh, oh oh oh
