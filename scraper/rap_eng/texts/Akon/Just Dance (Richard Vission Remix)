[Verse 1]
Wish I could shut my playboy mouth
How'd I turn my shirt inside out? (Inside out, right)
Control your poison, babe
Roses have thorns, they say
And we're all gettin' hosed tonight

[Chorus]
Just dance
Just dance
Just dance

[Pre-Chorus]
What's going on on the floor?
I love this record, baby, but I can't see straight anymore
Keep it cool
What's the name of this club?
I can't remember, but it's alright, alright

[Chorus]
Just dance
Just j-j-just dance
