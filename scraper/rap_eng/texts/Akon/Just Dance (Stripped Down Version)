[Intro]
RedOne
Gaga

[Verse 1]
I've had a little bit too much, much
All of the people start to rush
A dizzy twister dance
Can't find my drink or man
Where are my keys?
I lost my phone

[Pre-Chorus]
What's going on on the floor?
I love this record, baby, but I can't see straight anymore
Keep it cool
What's the name of this club?
I can't remember, but it's alright

[Chorus]
Just dance
Gonna be okay
Da-da-doo-doot-n, just dance
Spin that record, babe
Da-da-doo-doot-n, just dance
Gonna be okay
Da-da-da-dance, dance, dance
Just j-j-just dance

[Verse 2]
Wish I could shut my playboy mouth
How'd I turn my shirt inside out?
Control your poison, babe
Roses have thorns, they say
And we're all gettin' hosed tonight

[Pre-Chorus]
What's going on on the floor?
I love this record, baby, but I can't see straight anymore
Keep it cool
What's the name of this club?
I can't remember, but it's alright, alright

[Chorus]
Just dance
Gonna be okay
Da-da-doo-doot-n, just dance
Spin that record, babe
Da-da-doo-doot-n, just dance
Gonna be okay
Da-da-da-dance, dance, dance
Just j-j-just dance
