Yeah
You know we gotta do this one worldwide, you know
(It's time for a change, you know!)
Gotta let everybody know that... (It's time for a change!)
What's going on out there
(I do recognize)
Uh
Kasinova Tha Don

[Verse 1]
Dear Lord, can you help me?
I’m feeling trapped in a world that ain’t healthy
Nobody knows all the misery that I live on
It got me feeling like a child when my hopes gone
My mama told me: "never worry baby stay strong"
The cemetery is a place where I lay low
I send my hearts to the troops in the cold war
I try to picture in my head what they die for
And you and I know the truth but we won’t speak
And everybody need to reach if you want peace
Please Make a step if you wanna live good
Never settle for less because they know we could
I make a difference to the world today
And we can put it back in motion nothing more to say
Heavenly father help the seeds grow
And all the damage in the dark let it all show

[Chorus] x2
This is what we do
Between me and you
Imma tell the truth
(I’m revealing it for you)
Baby it’s not cool
You know the rule
Don’t play the fool
(I’m revealing it for you)

[Verse 2]
Selling my soul was a never mind
You know a brother did enough when he dead in line
Look at the world that we all face
Even Japan had it hard with the earthquakes
We got to do it worldwide so we can't wait
And everybody grab a plate choose your own fate
You'll never let them see you down and out
And if your talking you can show them what the pounds about
And keep it walking they will never know
Watch my foes cause this is all real
I pack steel cause they wanna see my cats peel
Picture me drowning in my own blood
Never that because I know that its no love
Sewn back
Wanna get em in ya living room
So baby follow my lead and I can show where we going soon
And if you got a good plan people let it stick
And I can tell you right now we ain't 'bout shit

[Chorus]x2
This is what we do
Between me and you
Imma tell the truth
(I’m revealing it for you)
Baby it’s not cool
You know the rule
Don’t play the fool
(I’m revealing it for you)

[Verse 3]
How many times did I have to show ya?
So don’t get mad at Kasinova
It takes time to remain true
I take a part of my brain and give it back to the cold youth
I tell the truth but you wanna keep secrets
So what you hide? you know we already seen it
Here comes a revolution
And so the cops get to shooting and stop my recruiting
So now we coming back for more- cause what you saw
And that your city couldn't take another war
Promised the streets to be lift from the concrete
And when we fall, can't bounce to our own feet
Swallow my melon, ain't no tellin' if a fella make it
Started selling, remain thugging now affiliated
And if you want it then you know that you got to get it
And work hard, stay free, baby stay commited

[Chorus]
This is what we do
Between me and you
Imma tell the truth
(I’m revealing it for you)
Baby it’s not cool
You know the rule
Don’t play the fool
(I’m revealing it for you)
