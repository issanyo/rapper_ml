Yo, excuse me, beg your pardon girl
Do you have any idea what you starting girl
You got me tingiling, come to me mingiling
Steppin off lookin bootylicious and jingling

When you walk, I see you baby girl
When you talk, I believe it baby girl
I like that, thick-petite and pretty
Little touch is a ditty

Love to work the kitty like purr
She loves to stirr it up purr
I can hear her purring up
'Cause she's the type that'll get arouse-y of

Get you excited and call her boyfriend up (ohh)
What's the man without the plan B
We can meet up at the hutter house for the T.V
So stand by like a butty ass
While I watch this beautiful thing shake that ass

So hot I gon' need some rain in here
Type to make ex-gangstas bang in here
Girl you could do anything you want in here

Clown if you want to, frown if you want to
You ain't even gotta drop down if you want to
'Cause I'd rather see you shake it standin'
Either way you do it girl you look outstandin' (uhhuuuhh)

And now you got me spending (uhhuuhhh)
The way you got that body bendin' (uhhhuhh)
Ass like that girl you gotta be kickin'
And we goin' to church next day repentant

Lap dancing for my FA crew
Slide it ova to boo 'cause he want some too
Up in the V.I.P. with no fee
Blessing you with the G even though we gettin' it free so

In the back seat of your Mazaratti-ratti
Jiggle jiggle it to the left (ah ah ah)

Jiggle it to the front then jiggle it to the back
And jiggle jiggle it all all night (ah ah ah)
