Yeah!

I'm lookin' for some trouble... (I'm a gangsta nigga!) {NON STOP! }

[Chorus]
Catch me in the back, Mack on my 'Lac
Now workin' trap, got that dope and that crack
Yeaah! (yeeeeaaahh!) - A known supplier!
Yeaah! (yeeeeaaahh!) - Yay got that fire!
Yeaah! (I got enough nigga!)
I got that haze, (12 .12s!) got that dro, got that piff, (58 .58s!)
Got that shit, that you sniff, man, I hold the .fo'-fifth;
Yeaah! - A known supplier!
Yeaah! - Yay got that fire!

[Verse]

Got your bitch on tha plane when she? air to Pu'to? . (BRING IT DOWN NOW!)

But it don't worry me  - cause I stay with a Mack!
And I ridin' a 'Lac - with some shit on my lap!
BLAAAAAAAT!  - I hate ya whole team, lay down flat!
The world's a big pussy - waiting to get fuck!

Roll up in that Porsche truck - a grand Turbo!
You's a blunt here and prose - with big .fo'-fo'

Now the kid is home, it's my time to shine! (YEAH!)

[Chorus]
Catch me in the back, Mack on my 'Lac
Now workin' trap, got that dope and that crack
Yeaah! (yeeeeaaahh!) - A known supplier!
Yeaah! (yeeeeaaahh!) - Yay got that fire!
Yeaah! (I got enough nigga!)
I got that haze, (12 .12s!) got that dro, got that piff, (58 .58s!)
Got that shit, that you sniff, man, I hold the .fo'-fifth;
Yeaah! - A known supplier!
Yeaah! - Yay got that fire!
