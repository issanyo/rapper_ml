Hoola lalala hoola lalala
Hoola lalala lalalala
Hoola lalala hoola lalala
Hoola lalala
[Verse 1]
Oh, I wanna be with you
Oh, I know you want me too

[Pre-Chorus]
So can I get a toot toot for the lovers tonight
Toot toot love when it's just right?
Toot toot, it's about to go down
So here we go, here we go now

[Chorus]
Why you gotta feel so right?
Why you gotta, why you gotta leave me open wide?
Love it when you love me right
Why you gotta, why you gotta take over my mind?
Every time, why you gotta take over my mind?
Every time, why you gotta leave me hypnotized?

Hoola lalala hoola lalala
Hoola lalala lalalala
Hoola lalala hoola lalala
Hoola lalala

[Verse 2]
Oh, you got me in your palms (hands)
But I want, want you in my arms, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
So can I get a toot toot for the lovers tonight
Toot toot love when it's just right?
Toot toot, it's about to go down
So here we go, here we go now

[Chorus]
Why you gotta feel so right?
Why you gotta, why you gotta leave me open wide?
Love it when you love me right
Why you gotta, why you gotta take over my mind?
Every time, why you gotta take over my mind?
Every time, why you gotta leave me hypnotized?

Hoola lalala hoola lalala
Hoola lalala lalalala
Hoola lalala hoola lalala
Hoola lalala

[Bridge]
You got my mind, girl, spinning 'round and 'round
You got it spinning
So far away, girl, where it can't be found
Just go and admit

[Pre-Chorus]
Toot toot for the lovers tonight
Toot toot love when it's just right?
Toot toot, it's about to go down
So here we go, here we go now

[Chorus]
Why you gotta feel so right?
Why you gotta, why you gotta leave me open wide?
Love it when you love me right
Why you gotta, why you gotta take over my mind?
Every time, why you gotta take over my mind?
Every time, why you gotta leave me hypnotized?
Hoola lalala hoola lalala
Hoola lalala lalalala
Hoola lalala hoola lalala
Hoola lalala
