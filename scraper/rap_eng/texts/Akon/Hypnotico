[Intro]
All of the girls that know that they sexy
C'mon

[Verse 1]
Flip it, slap it down, it's gonna get nasty
Hypnoti-notico, hypnoti-notico
Shimmy-shakers, earthquakers up in the city
Hypnoti-notico, hypnoti-notico
They love me for my body, I'm original sexy
Hypnoti-notico, hypnoti-notico

[Chorus]
All the boys all love it when we do our thing
We're just some silly heartbreakers tonight (Tonight)
All the boys all want it, but it don't mean a thing
We got tonight (Tonight), we're just some silly heartbreakers tonight
All the boys all love it when we do our thing
We're just some silly heartbreakers tonight (Tonight)
All the boys all want it, but it don't mean a thing
We got tonight (Tonight), we're just some silly heartbreakers tonight

[Post-Chorus]
Hypnoti-notico, hypnoti-notico

[Verse 2]
Red eyes widen, envious smiling
Hypnoti-notico, hypnoti-notico
Sunburned, baby, hurts like crazy
Hypnoti-notico, hypnoti-notico
Hungry for some yum, yum, gonna get me some, some
Hypnoti-notico, hypnoti-notico

[Chorus]
All the boys all love it when we do our thing
We're just some silly heartbreakers tonight (Tonight)
All the boys all want it, but it don't mean a thing
We got tonight (Tonight), we're just some silly heartbreakers tonight
All the boys all love it when we do our thing
We're just some silly heartbreakers tonight (Tonight)
All the boys all want it, but it don't mean a thing
We got tonight (Tonight), we're just some silly heartbreakers tonight

[Bridge]
Ah-ah-ah-ah
Hypnoti-notico, hypnoti-notico
Ah-ah-ah-ah
Hypnoti-notico, hypnoti-notico
'Cause all the boys go crazy, 'cause all the boys go crazy
Hypnoti-notico, hypnoti-notico
Whine up your body like you're a boricua
All of the men love a silly heartbreaker
Hypnoti-notico, hypnoti-notico

[Chorus]
All the boys all love it when we do our thing
We're just some silly heartbreakers tonight (Tonight)
All the boys all want it, but it don't mean a thing
We got tonight (Tonight), we're just some silly heartbreakers tonight
All the boys all love it when we do our thing
We're just some silly heartbreakers tonight (Tonight)
All the boys all want it, but it don't mean a thing
We got tonight (Tonight), we're just some silly heartbreakers tonight
Tonight, tonight
All the boys all want it, but it don't mean a thing
We got tonight (Tonight), we're just some silly heartbreakers tonight

[Outro]
Hypnoti-notico, hypnoti-notico
