[Verse 1: Rihanna]
I was picking up your clothes in the closet (closet)
I was about to throw your jeans in the washer (washer)
'Till I saw a piece of paper saying Tasha (Tasha)
I gotta say I found this a bit shockin (shockin)
It's on receipts here to tell you went shopping (shoppin)
You bought some Nike shoes, but why you buying stockings?

[Pre-hook: Rihanna]
Boy how could you lie to me? Thought you would die for me
I'm not accepting another apology
After 3 years, I'mma let it go
I ain't standin' around crying no more
Got your bags packed sitting by the door
I'mma leave your heart broken on the floor

[Hook: Rihanna]
You're gonna be in the emergency room
I'm standing by your bed
And so tempted to pull out your I.V
You're gonna be in the emergency room
I'm fighting with myself
I can't hurt you even though you hurt me
You're gonna be in the emergency room
Tryin to call a nurse but nobody can help you now
Let me see you try to live without me
Now where's your heartbeat? Flat line on the EKG

[Verse 2: Rihanna]
Well, I was home late at night watching TV
Got a call from my girl saying "RiRi
Saw your man in the club I thought he was out of town doing business
Said that he'd be back in three weeks?"
And now I'm mad, sitting in the kitchen getting sad
Looking at your pictures

[Pre-hook: Rihanna]
Boy, How could you lie to me
Thought you would die for me
I'm not accepting another apology
After 3 years, Ima let it go
Can't standing around crying no more
Got your bags packed sitting by the door
I'mma leave your heart broken on the floor

[Hook: Rihanna]
You're gonna be in the emergency room
I'm standing by your bed
And so tempted to pull out your I.V
You're gonna be in the emergency room
I'm fighting with myself
I can't hurt you even though you hurt me
You're gonna be in the emergency room
Tryin to call a nurse but nobody can help you now
Let me see you try to live without me
Now where's your heartbeat? Flat line on the EKG

[Verse 3: Akon]
I did you wrong, girl
Had a bunch of numbers in my phone, girl (I did)
But we been in this relationship too long, girl
For you to be listenin' to your silly home girls
Better go on, girl
Now baby think about it (think about it)
Everything we do they gonna read about it (read about it)
Put it on a radio and TV outlet
Do you want to see your picture in that paper?
You know them haters
You hear that 808, the drum
That's my heart beat, I'm going numb
I said Rihanna, I'm feeling stressed
I'm going under cardiac arrest

[Hook: Rihanna]
You're gonna be in the emergency room
I'm standing by your bed
And so tempted to pull out your I.V
You're gonna be in the emergency room
I'm fighting with myself
I can't hurt you even though you hurt me
You're gonna be in the emergency room
Tryin to call a nurse but nobody can help you now
Let me see you try to live without me
Now where's your heartbeat? Flat line on the EKG
