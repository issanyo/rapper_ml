[Intro: Akon]
Give it back to me, babe
If I give love to you

[Verse 1: Akon]
Let's get it out in the open
Can't leave it unspoken
Baby you got the potion
Love and devotion
Affection and closeness
This feeling is golden

[Bridge: Akon]
What must I do to be that guy to you
Why not try something different from what you're used to
Both in the same position know what you go through
I know, I know

[Chorus: Akon]
If I give love to you, If I give love to you ooh
If I give love to you, say if I give love to you, ooh
Would you give it back to me? Said would you give it back to me
Would you give it back to me? Said would you give it back to me
If i give love to you, say if I give love to you, ooh
Would you give it back to me?

[Verse 2: Akon]
This could be amazing
Got good conversation, with great penetration
Don't do well with patience, so don't keep me waiting
Just get in formation

[Bridge: Akon]
What must I do to be that guy to you
Why not try something different from what you're used to
Both in the same position know what you go through
I know, I know

[Chorus: Akon]
If I give love to you, If I give love to you ooh
If I give love to you, say if I give love to you, ooh
Would you give it back to me? Said would you give it back to me
Would you give it back to me? Said would you give it back to me
If i give love to you, say if I give love to you, ooh
Would you give it back to me? Would you give it back to me?
Said would you give it back to me? Would you give it back to me?
If I give love to you

[Bridge: Akon]
What must I do to be that guy to you
Why not try something different from what you're used to
Both in the same position know what you go through
I know, I know


[Chorus: Akon]
If I give love to you, If I give love to you ooh
If I give love to you, say if I give love to you, ooh
Would you give it back to me? Said would you give it back to me
Would you give it back to me? Said would you give it back to me
If i give love to you, say if I give love to you, ooh
Would you give it back to me? Would you give it back to me?
Said would you give it back to me? Would you give it back to me?
If I give love to you
