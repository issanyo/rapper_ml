A moment ago it seemed it was yesterday
You were here with me and everything seems to be the same
What am I supposed to do with all these empty rooms?
Sit here in solitude with the smell of your perfume
You never took the time to know me
You never took the time to understand
You never took the time to know me, yeah
'Cause lovin' you is all I ever had, still lovin' you is all I ever have
This wasn't what I wanted to be, a man in misery
Girl I look back a thousand times and can't believe that you left me
(Why you leave me baby)
Why can't you understand my pain, how can I explain
Girl I don't know what I'm doin' wrong, I can't believe that your love is gone
'Cause you never took the time to know me
(Said you never took the time to know me)
You never took the time to understand, yeah
(Oh, oh )
Said you never took the time to know me
(Said you never took the time to know me)
See lovin' you is all I ever had
(I had, I had)
Baby lovin' you is all I ever had
Ooh yeah, you're all I need, you're all I see
And I wish that we could do it again
'Cause you never took the time to know me
(Baby you never took the time to know me)
You never took the time to understand, yeah
(Oh, oh)
Said you never took the time to know me, yeah
Because of you now I'm just a lonely man
(Oh)
Because of you now I'm just a lonely man
