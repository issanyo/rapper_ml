[Verse 1: T-Pain]
Don’t nobody wanna live right no more
Everybody wanna live wrong…
And they wanna give up
Cus they don’t really wanna fight no more
Shit’s been going on… way too long
But if you take a look at this
And listen to it
I guarantee that you’ll know
Homie I got yo back
I’m not gon leave you out to dry
I will take you off the street
And I’m gon show you everything you can about it

(Hook)
If I got then you got it (and we got it)
If I got then you got it (and we got it)
If I got then you got it (and we got it)
If I got then you got it (and we got it)
If I ain’t got it we gon get it get it get it get it get it get it get it get it get it get it get it uuh
If I got then you got it (and we got it)
If I got then you got it (and we got it)
And we got it

[Verse 2: Akon]
If I eat ain’t nobody around me ever gon starve
24/7, no days off, a nigga work hard
I know my niggas
My niggas know me
On everything I love cus I struggle real hard just to feed these streets
A real live nigga, so real
You can ask Big Meech (bout me)
You can ask T Money (T Money)
You can ask South West T (fo real)
Ain’t got a whole lot of time (time)
But I got a whole lot of money
Whole lot of women, a lot more love to give

(Hook)
So if I got then you got it (and we got it)
If I got then you got it (and we got it)
If I got then you got it (and we got it)
If I got then you got it (and we got it)
If I ain’t got it we gon get it get it get it get it get it get it get it get it get it get it get it uuh
If I got then you got it (and we got it)
If I got then you got it (and we got it)

[Verse 3: 2face]
You see a hungry man is an angry man
It could be hunger for some knowledge, hunger for the truth
So I gotta keep my hustle on, so I can get it
And I acquire the knowledge and I pass it on to you
One man down, to another so the thing go
One by one, the whole world will know
But it’s funny how sometimes the world will make you want to give up
So I tell you now come tele mi
If I tell you the truth make you come tele mi
So feel free, feel free

(Hook)
If I got then you got it (and we got it)
If I got then you got it (and we got it)
If I got then you got it (and we got it)
If I got then you got it (and we got it)
If I ain’t got it we gon get it get it get it get it get it get it get it get it get it get it get it uuh
If I got then you got it (and we got it)
If I got then you got it (and we got it)
And we got it
