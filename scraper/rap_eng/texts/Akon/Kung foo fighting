Oh-Oh-Oh-Oh
Oh-Oh-Oh-Oh
Oh-Oh-Oh-Oh
Oh-Oh-Oh-Oh

Everybody was kung fu fighting
Those kids were fast as lighting
In fact it was a little bit frightening
But they fought with expert timing

There were funky china man
From funky china town
They were chopping them up
They were chopping them down

It's an ancient chinese art
And everybody knew their part
From a faintin' to a slip
And a kick in from the hip

Everybody was kung fu fighting
Those kids were fast as lighting
In fact it was a little bit frightning
But they fought with expert timing

There was funky Billie John
And little Sammy John
He said: Here comes the big boss
Let's get it on

He took a vow and made a stand
Started swaying with the hand
But emotion made me skip
Now we're into a brand new trick

Everybody was kung fu fighting (hooh)
Those kids were fast as lighting (hyah)
In fact it was a little bit frightning (hooh)
But they did it with expert timing (hyah)

Oh-Oh-Oh-Oh (hyah)
Oh-Oh-Oh-Oh (hyah)
Oh-Oh-Oh-Oh (hooh)
Oh-Oh-Oh-Oh Keep on, Keep on, Keep on, Keep on (hyah)

Everybody was kung fu fighting (hooh)
Those kids were fast as lighting (hyah)
In fact it was a little bit frightening (hooh)
Make sure you have expert timing (hyah)

Oh-Oh-Oh Kung Fu Fightin
Hands and feet, fast as lighting

Oh-Oh-Oh-Oh (hooh)
Oh-Oh-Oh-Oh (hyah)
Oh-Oh-Oh-Oh Keep on, Keep on, Keep on, Keep on (hooh)
Oh-Oh-Oh-Oh (hyah)
