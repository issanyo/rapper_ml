[Verse 1]
I know they wanna come and separate us
But they can't do us nothin'
You're the one I want and I'ma continue lovin'
Cause you're considered wife and I'm considered husband
And I'ma always be there for you
And either way you look at it, I ain't goin' nowhere from my muffin'
Cause she gonna hold it down, can't nobody tell her nothin'
That got the kind of love that always make a better fussin'
And that's what gets me closer to you

[Pre-Chorus]
And no one know why I'm into you
'Cause you'll never know what it's like to walk in our shoes
And no one know the things we've been through
Can never measure up to half of what I put you through
That's why we'll break through

[Chorus]
And I don't care what they say, I'm gonna be with you
I'm gonna be with you, I wanna be with you
And I don't care what they do, I'm gonna be with you
I'm gonna be with you, I'm gonna be with you

[Verse 2]
Seems like every day that go by, things are gettin' harder
Wanna be the one that give you the whole enchilada
Cause I know what my baby like, I lean you on that Prada
You ain't got to match with the shoes
All about knowin' you, I'm into doin' things to keep her longer
Stickin' together forever, watch you grow stronger
That's the way it has to be, everythin' proper
Keepin' it always true

[Pre-Chorus]
And no one know why I'm into you
Cause you'll never know what it's like to walk in our shoes
And no one know the things we've been through
Can never measure up to half of what I put you through
That's why we'll break through

[Chorus]
And I don't care what they say, I'm gonna be with you
I'm gonna be with you, I wanna be with you
And I don't care what they do, I'm gonna be with you
I'm gonna be with you, I'm gonna be with you

[Bridge]
You are everythin' in my life, see the joy you bring
And ain't no one I compare you to
And I know that you will never walk away from me no matter what
And that's why I plan to do the same thing for you
And I want you to know

[Chorus]
And I don't care what they say, I'm gonna be with you
I'm gonna be with you, I wanna be with you
And I don't care what they do, I'm gonna be with you
I'm gonna be with you, I'm gonna be with you

And I don't care what they say, I'm gonna be with you
I'm gonna be with you, I wanna be with you
And I don't care what they do, I'm gonna be with you
I'm gonna be with you, I'm gonna be with you
