[Kat DeLuna]
Sleepless night
All that I could think about was us
And the way that only you know how to touch me
I try to move on
But I know I'm just fooling myself
Don't wanna be kissed,touched,loved
Or give my heart to someone else

I wanna make up ... na na na na
But before we make up ... na na na na
Promise me you'll never do it again
Tell me that we'll make it through to the end

I wanna make up ... nana na na na
But before we make up ... nana na na na
Promise me you'll never do it again
Tell me that we'll make it through to the end

[Akon]
Girl I know mistakes were made between us two
And we show our eyes that night even said somethings weren't true
Why'd you go and haven't seen my girl since then
Why can't it be the way it was
You are my homie lover and friend

[Kat DeLuna]
I wanna make up ... na na na na
But before we make up ... na na na na
Promise me you'll never do it again
Tell me that we'll make it through to the end

I wanna make up ... nana na na na
But before we make up ... nana na na na
Promise me you'll never do it again
Tell me that we'll make it through to the end

Don't lie (Don't lie)
Promise everyday you're gonna try (Try)
To make me feel like everything's alright (Make me feel alright)
Like I'm the apple of your eye (Of your eye)

I wanna make up ... na na na na
But before we make up ... na na na na
Promise me you'll never do it again
Tell me that we'll make it through to the end

I wanna make up ... nana na na na
But before we make up ... nana na na
Promise me you'll never do it again
Tell me that we'll make it through to the end

I wish I could fly with you
I wish I could lay with you (Lay with you)
I just wanna die with you (Die with you)
Get out my grind w√Øth you
