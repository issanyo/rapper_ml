[Intro]
I can see it, it's funny, man
‘Cause this life is not going nowhere
And you gon' see it
Wherever there's struggle, knahmean?
{"Once in a while I could look at you"}
I see my pain in yo' eyes, man
So I know you feeling me
{"And see the twinkle in your eyes"}
It's that twinkle, man
That sign of struggle, I've seen it in me

[Verse 1]
‘Cause everyday I can't help but see it
That people ain't satisfied
And you're hating your 9 to 5
And e'rybody wanna live another life
But ain't no length you go or mountain you climb
Not to better your days
But all that would do is leave room for people to say
"I guess you're living better now
Share a little of that cheddar now"
‘Cause I remember days back when
A brother was hustling and robbing too
I done tossed the Beretta now
On a whole nother level now
Still I can't enjoy my fame
Unless my people doing the same and get money too

[Hook]
{"Once in a while I could look at you"}
Ohh, once in a while
{"And see the twinkle in your eyes"}
And I can see that you don't ever wanna struggle no more
Struggle no more
{"Once in a while I could look at you"}
Ooh yeah
{"And see the twinkle in your eyes"}
And I can see that you don't ever wanna cry no more

[Verse 2]
‘Cause every time you ask me, I'm grindin'
It shouldn't have to be that way
You shouldn't have to pay my way
I shouldn't have to want for a brighter day
Got a little little problem on the way
Bounty hunters checking state to state
Child support lady on your case
Not to mention tickets you ain't never paid
"Oh what must I do?" is what you'll be asking
God, please hold it down for me
Don't let Satan get ahold of me
I'm tryin' to tell you, it can happen to me too
But it happened a lot worse to my brother
Muhammad, I thank God he recovered, yeah

[Hook] w/ variations + ad libs

{"Once in a while I could look at you"}

[Bridge]
‘Cause I see your pain now (ooh yeah)
‘Cause I see your pain now (ooh yeah)
And I can feel you strain now
And I can see you cryin'
And inside you're dyin'
You're no longer the same now (‘cause you got to)
But you gotta maintain now

[Hook] – 2X w/ variations + ad libs

[Outro]
Ooh yeah, ooh yeah
Ooh yeah, ooh yeah
Ooh yeah, ooh yeah
