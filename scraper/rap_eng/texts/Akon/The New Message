[Intro/Chorus: Akon]
See, I'm a real G from head to toe
The whole West Coast to let you know
Got a flow that's thick as the ammonia
Never will I leave California
Where is my Ds?

[Unidentified Artist]
You know, sometimes you gotta go back
Back in the time, back to the basis
Til we understand, what is goin' on
Okey

WHAT'S GOIN' ON! -----] Chuck D
So yo, KAM
[KAM] Said what?
KICK THAT SHIT -----] Flavor Flav

[Verse 1: KAM]
Man, real motherfuckin' fags everywhere
And keep positions in the game and it's just ain't fare
How they call the shots and they make the choice
In this business real niggas ain't got no voice
Rats in the videos catch small chat
Caught speed up in Cali' like they all that
I tried to get paid, but I can't get far
Cause they don't never wanna see real nigga Rap Star
But I was born, with a creative mind
Inclined to resurrect the deaf, dumb and blind "That's right"
A nigga tried to troop, so when I ride on you
Man, only God knows what I'm gonna do
I roll through every ghetto, and be in every state show
When I move it, like I be movin' heavy weight
So all the places where y'all dip in and where y'all stay
Mayday, cause ain't body save today

[Hook: KAM]
Aiy, don't blame me like West Coast rap is dead
Y'all are tryin' not to break no bread

[Chorus: Akon w/ variations]
Okey, see, I'm a real G from head to toe
The whole West Coast to let you know
Got a flow that's thick as the ammonia
Never will I leave California
Where is my dreams?

[KAM:] It's like a struggle to rhyme, make you wanna just get outta California
[Akon] Then, where is my dreams?
[KAM:] It's like a struggle to rhyme, make you wanna just get outta California

[Verse 2: KAM]
Devils gettin' mad
Radio and TV got niggas doin' too much, just tryin' to be Rap ??
All my niggas on the front line battle or fight
And can't even get to shine, man, you know that ain't right
Killers and gangsters, they ring my phone
And be askin' me: why I'm not on?
A lot of dumb hateration, just cause I'm in the nation
Can't get no love on TV, or the Radio Station
The cold ramp torture the nigga 'til he cracked
I just got to turn it down, most of these crackers really whack
A damn shame, it's so lame, a nigga case ignite
Right sometimes I think I do the same
That's where I might put it to tame

[Hook: KAM]
Aiy, don't blame me like West Coast rap is dead
Y'all are tryin' not to break no bread

[Chorus: Akon]
Okey, see, I'm a real G from head to toe
The whole West Coast to let you know
Got a flow that's thick as the ammonia
Never will I leave California
Where is my dreams?

[KAM:] It's like a struggle to rhyme, make you wanna just get outta California
[Akon] Then, where is my dreams?
[KAM:] It's like a struggle to rhyme, make you wanna just get outta California

[Verse 3: KAM]
These fools liars, they're all ain't nothin' but haters
They ain't thugs, pimps or pushers, these niggas is big fakers
Drivin' big cars on 20 Inch rims
But will they help you blow? "No" well alright then
They're suckers, faggots, blockers, maggots
Dick jackers and some of them even drug addicts
But you say I'm rude? - uh, I'm a nice dude
I just wind up knockin' out Ice Cube "SOLO"
So now my thugs say: Homie, I don't need no record deal
Cause the East is the turf, I'm just keepin' it real
And all my niggas smokin' leafer, cause shit's gettin' deeper
Got them paranoid, tryin' to avoid the Grim Reaper
Keepin' hands on their heats, chucks on their feats
Wearin' white Ts and runnin' the streets
Cause it's all about money in this land of milkin' honey
So I'm down with Farhekahn, ain't a damn thing funny, nigga

[Hook: KAM]
Aiy, don't blame me like West Coast rap is dead
Y'all are tryin' not to break no bread

[Chorus: Akon]
Okey, see, I'm a real G from head to toe
The whole West Coast to let you know
Got a flow that's thick as the ammonia
Never will I leave California
Where is my dreams?

[KAM:] It's like a struggle to rhyme, make you wanna just get outta California
[Akon] Then, where is my dreams?
[KAM:] It's like a struggle to rhyme, make you wanna just get outta California

[Akon]
Awww, awww, bang bang
Awww, awww, bang bang
Don't test me now, bang bang
Awww, awww, bang bang
This is the Westcoast sound
