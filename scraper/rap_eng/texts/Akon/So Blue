[Verse 1]
I see you every damn day and I can't help wondering why
Why you look so good, but I ain't ever seen you smile
Got a man that could buy you everything in this world
But I guess he ain't loving you right, girl, no

[Chorus]
Cause I, I can see that you're lonely
Baby, your one and only
He ain't giving you attention
Wanna know, wanna know, wanna know
Is he telling you you're sexy?
Girl, I wonder if you let me
When I look at you I wonder, wonder, wonder
What's he doing with a girl like you
I wanna know, know, know, know
You're too fine to be looking so blue
So blue, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh [2x]

So blue, so blue

[Verse 2]
With a body like that, girl, you being his ain't fair
See, I will love you all time and all around town, I swear
I can see that he ain't been hitting that at night
One ride with me would change your life

[Chorus]
Cause I, I can see that you're lonely
Baby, you're one and only
He ain't giving you attention
Wanna know, wanna know, wanna know
Is he telling you you're sexy?
Girl, I wonder if you let me
When I look at you I wonder, wonder, wonder
What he's doing with a girl like you
I wanna know, know, know, know
You're too fine to be looking so blue
So blue, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh [2x]

So blue, so blue

[Bridge]
See, blue ain't your color
Baby, you need a lover
That knows what your life comes through
Every time it ain't acting as it should
I'm that solution, cause your man is a loser
I'm looking, you feel so blue, so blue, so blue

[Chorus]
Cause I, I can see that you're lonely
Baby, you're one and only
He ain't giving you attention
Wanna know, wanna know, wanna know
Is he telling you you're sexy?
Girl, I wonder if you let me
When I look at you I wonder, wonder, wonder
What he's doing with a girl like you
I wanna know, know, know, know
You're too fine to be looking so blue
So blue, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh [2x]

So blue, so blue

[Outro]
Too fine to be looking so blue
Too fine to be looking so blue
How he ended with a girl like you
Too fine to be looking so blue
