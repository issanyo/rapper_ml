A dark whiny room
Running down with my had gone
And its’ so cold
Hide behind the ..station
I can feel blood hands sniffing and getting closer
I need to leave town ‘cause I just shot down an officer

[Hook:]
I’m victim I wanted
Two strikes and this will make three
They beat me down like Rodney
A victim of brutality it was self defense, self defense
All I know is that i’m innocent
Is a conspiracy

No time to waste
I’m runnin from incarceration
Get out my way ‘cause i’m not going back to prison
They make me a long long
The moment when they stash that .. in my car
Didn’t do nothing illegal
But I’ve been set up to be the one to take the fall

[Hook]

Just another routine stop ‘cause I was speed it
Thought they just give me a ticket and i’ll believe it
Little that I know I was a part of a big ..
Drug deal august ..straight about ..
Why so many other, in one spot
Something isn’t right, no is just not
But before I could figure out what was going on
I was on the ground getting beat up and stump on
I’m half day, i’m half day
What did I do to deserve this
I must escape before they kill a nigga
I’d rather gone from this host and pull a trigger

[Hook]
