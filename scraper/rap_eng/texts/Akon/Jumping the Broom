[Verse 1]
A part of me knows, a part of me knows
A part of me don't want nothing you're not a part of
No way that I, would wish to die
That's right there with your perfect love and by my side

[Pre-Chorus]
Look at your perfect face, there is no time to waste
Baby I'd go as far for you

[Chorus]
As jumping the broom, jumping the broom
You'd jump for me and I'd jump for you
Jumping the broom, jumping the broom
Nothing my love wouldn't do for you

[Verse 2]
Baby, wanna see you shine, shine
And I don't want nothing else but this dream of mine
I want all the sea, your sky and I don't want to see doves cry
Baby this kind of love was made by design

[Pre-Chorus]
Look at your perfect face, there is no time to waste
Baby I'd go as far for you

[Chorus]
As jumping the broom, jumping the broom
You'd jump for me and I'd jump for you
Jumping the broom, jumping the broom
Nothing my love wouldn't do for you

[Bridge]
Hey love, promise I'll never let you go
Hey love, hey love
Jumping the broom
You'd jump for me and I'd jump for you

[Chorus]
As jumping the broom, jumping the broom
You'd jump for me and I'd jump for you
Jumping the broom, jumping the broom
Nothing my love wouldn't do for you
