Yeah!
Let's go some trouble
Yeah, hey hey

At night that I've planned to enjoy aha
Go... All of my boy
Let... By the toy
And watch them ladies all get...
I hear the whispers in the boys
Sayin that I'm the perfect choice
She says she want a bad boy
To make a... Joy

Chorus:
You remind me of my favorite girl
Who loves to party and it's... Girl
And when she's tipsy she... Girl
And I just wanna know if you're just like her

Chorus:
And so let's get trouble
I'm in the... Trouble
Let's... Some trouble
I'm... Trouble

Got something here to... Sleep
So s*** that you can't believe
Call on her when I'm in need
She said just ask charlie sheen
I watched her croll up on her knee
She had me begging pretty please
No my... She follows
But this time I stay down beneath

[2 x Chorus:]
