Better than the average show
But the question is do you wanna
'Cause you've heard this all before
You gotta be tired of the same things
The same old tunes, the same old games

For the right type of guy
I can be, be that guy
But I wanna take my time with you
No rushin', no rushin'
Take my time with you
So I'll start by askin' you to

Tell me this
Girl, what's you name?
And I'll tell you that
Ooh, you look so good

I wanna take you to dinner
'Cause it's a sat you've never been
I'll buy a dozen roses
And put a diamond on your hand

I'll take you on the road
To all my shows
Girl, it won't be the same
'Cause I'mma change the game
