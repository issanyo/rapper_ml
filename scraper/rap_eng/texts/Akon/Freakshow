[Chorus]
'Cause I guarantee you've never seen a show like this before
Gonna show you something that you can't ignore
Wanna take a peek?
Then open up the curtains
'Cause I guarantee you've never seen a show like this before
Gonna show you something that you can't ignore
Wanna take a peek?
Then open up the curtains
Baby, it's a freakshow

[Verse 1]
I wanna know, what do you like?
What would you say, if I said I'd do anything to you you want?
I wanna know
Yeah, it's alright
New positions, bet you would like
You've been screamin', "Stop, yes, please, hon!"
Baby, you've got tricks in my head
Craziest chick you've ever had
I heard what you said in your sleep
You wanna wear, you wanna mend
I like it rough, I like it fast
I know that deep down you're a freak

[Pre-Chorus]
Just say the magic words and I'll come
I'll hypnotize you
You're gonna lose your mind, don't you know?
Baby, it's a freakshow

[Chorus]
'Cause I guarantee you've never seen a show like this before
Gonna show you something that you can't ignore
Wanna take a peek?
Then open up the curtains
Baby, it's a freakshow
'Cause I guarantee you've never seen a show like this before
Gonna show you something that you can't ignore
'Cause I'm sure you're tired of being certain
Baby, it's a freakshow
Baby, it's a freakshow

[Verse 2]
When you're alone, what do you dream?
I wanna know your fantasy
Don't matter how wrong it might be
I wanna see, know what I mean
Psycho and fun, sexy and mean
It's just different when you're with me
I want it all
I got a spell, put it on you and I won't tell
Your secret, 'cause I am your slave
You want it hard, you want it tough
I like it long, never enough
I promise that I won't behave

[Pre-Chorus]
Just say the magic words and I'll come
I'll hypnotize you
You're gonna lose your mind, don't you know?
Baby, it's a freakshow

[Chorus]
'Cause I guarantee you've never seen a show like this before
Gonna show you something that you can't ignore
Wanna take a peek?
Then open up the curtains
Baby, it's a freakshow
'Cause I guarantee you've never seen a show like this before
Gonna show you something that you can't ignore
'Cause I'm sure you're tired of being certain
Baby, it's a freakshow
Baby, it's a freakshow

[Bridge]
Gimme gimme that
Gimme gimme that, oh
Give you, give you that freaky, freaky, freakshow
Like it like that kitty, kitty cat, oh
Baby, it's a freakshow
Gimme, gimme that
Gimme, gimme that, oh
Give you, give you that freaky, freaky, freakshow
Like it like that kitty, kitty cat, oh
Baby, it's a freakshow

[Chorus]
'Cause I guarantee you've never seen a show like this before
Gonna show you something that you can't ignore
Wanna take a peek?
Then open up the curtains
Baby, it's a freakshow
'Cause I guarantee you've never seen a show like this before
Wanna show you something that you can't ignore
Wanna take a peek?
Then open up the curtains
Baby, it's a freakshow
'Cause I guarantee you've never seen a show like this before
Gonna show you something that you can't ignore
'Cause I'm sure you're tired of being certain
Baby, it's a freakshow
Baby, it's a freakshow
Show, show, show, show
Show, show, show, show
Baby, it's a freakshow
