[Intro: Kanye West]
Heavy hitters fo' life, heavy hitters fo' life

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
You rappers think I give a fuck about the way that they spit
Wanna be on my album but don't want me on they shit
Everybody thought I was makin' a compilation
I was really makin' myself they competition
Fresh off the plane from the All-Star game
Bone girls on TV so it's All-Star trains
Just picture man (uh-huh), no snitchin' man
Somethin' for the fiends fresh out the kitchen, man
Last 9/11 I was poor on the ave, 'til I pluraled my math
Now it's Porsche 911 and I'm floorin' the gas
Gotta lotta problems, money's one that I not have no more
Uh, well Dame look at how everybody changed
Tell Jay that I'm 'bout to change the game
Tell Biggs that we about to get paid
All my niggas about to have it made
This makes everything else sound played
Goddamn Kanye! (Kanye! Kanye!)
Now hold up... Ain't nobody messin' with me dog
Now you say it ("Ain't nobody messin' with you at all!")
I told dude, "You can't even rap on my interlude"
Now does that make me as rude as Jude?
("When the album comin' out?") Man the peoples is askin'
Yamamoto Adidas is sick with the fashion
Y'all already got dough so just spit for the passion
The way ya rhyme give me Tribe Called QuestÂ‹ flashbacks
And let's not even bring up the tracks, man
Nope, nope, let's not do that man
You eatin' up the game like Pac-Man
And got the whole world shakin' just like crack fiends

[Hook: Kanye West]
Heavy hitters fo' life, Roc-a-Fella is fo' life
Throw your diamonds up, throw your diamonds up
Throw your diamonds
Let the beat ride out for a minute

[Interlude: GLC (Kanye West)]
Let's take it there, take it there man
It's not supposed to be [?]
(GLC where you at homie?)

[Verse 2: GLC]
How many niggas you know that put their life on the line
To get signed? Did a few high crimes, almost had lights out
After the sunshine you thinkin' it might count
How could I might doubt? Just look at my account
I used to work at the mall with nothin' at all
Seein' niggas that ball, that shit was depressin'
Keep my clothes in the cleaners, I ain't with the pressin'
When I copped them pounds it was my best investments
Dre got shot and that taught me a lesson
For stickin' niggas up and them rubbery masses
Last like Batman minus the tight pants
Would hit your baby momma but her elbows is ashy
Four different blues, man your outfit is clashin'
You ain't got no muscles, you weakling bastard
Man, look at your haircut
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, NAW, your hair sucks
How many niggas you know is really heavy hitters?
'87 Go-Getters, two hoes like John Ritter
Even did it on his crime picture and yeah
And offers to sell and yell, uh

[Hook: Kanye West]
Heavy hitters fo' life, Roc-A-Fella is fo' life
Throw your diamonds up, throw your diamonds up
Throw your diamonds
