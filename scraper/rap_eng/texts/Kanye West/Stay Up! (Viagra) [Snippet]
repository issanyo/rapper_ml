[Intro: 88-Keys]
Stay up!
Stay up, uh, stay up!

[Spoken: Kanye West]
Yo, this my dog 88-Keys joint right here
It's called “Viagra (Stay Up),” you know?
It’s on his new album, The Death of Adam
I can't give ya the whole thing
I'm just gon’ give you a piece of that
Yeah (Plain Pat, what up?)
It's kinda crazy, right?

[Verse: Kanye West]
What she got is so Niagara
Make a young nigga straight need Viagra
Make a old nigga give keys to Jaguar
Just to keep from all the tease and laughter
Her telling her homegirls that he couldn't stay up
In the restaurant with her voice way up
Please keep it discreet
Keep the business out of the street
She said "I would if he-a handle biz up in the sheets!"
Pop off like a thang thang, he keep keep
And every time that she bang bang, he skeet skeet
And he so bullheaded tried to three-peat
Try imagining something passionate
Between you, Cassie, and Kim Kardashian
Maybe that'll work when you get to hit that ass again
Or you can grab a Red Bull and sip that twice
Now y'all can have sexy time, it's nice!

[Interlude: Malik Yusef]
Wow-wow
The wordsmith, Malik Yusef
Yes!

[Spoken Word: Malik Yusef]
Well, once again
The Merlot has her so
Ready to succumb
Can we call it foreplay
If I use my thumb? Ay!
Will you still be feeling me
After I do you numb?
I wanna kiss your soul
So remove each Gucci shoe
Baby, be my baby
And I'll make your coochie coo
She bites my clavicle
While getting out her screams
Could tell by this music
We just getting out our dreams

[Outro: Kanye West]
Yeah, here go my dog Kweli shit
We just hit you with the snippet real quick
