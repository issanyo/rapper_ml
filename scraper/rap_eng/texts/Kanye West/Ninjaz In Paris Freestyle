MODENINE - NIGGAZ IN PARIS FREESTYLE

Listen , im here for the shock value the mode will lyricute ya
Fashion police licence to kill dont let me shoot ya
The way you kids are dressed i predict an odd future
Your colors loud ya talking loud , i gots to double mute ya
Compulsive biting got em exposing their worn teeth
Youll be amazed when we meet call it corn beef
Maize meat corn beef
I kill em with share wit but wit cannot be physically shared
You gotta stool flow your baddest linewill not be cheered (chaired)
Carrot jeans and over 30 then we should be scared
Some artiste show me love in public like we really peers
But when i call em up for a track they diva uh that shit weird
Uh i scratch my temple thats kinda queer
Fuck em fuck em fuck em fuck em fuck em
Pardon my french but you can suck the cocks on six apes
Dont even need you anymore no fox and the grapes
Yes im hardcore and youre a limp biscuit
Your careers eeeeeeerrr you dont wanna risk it
Im a guerilla tyrant call me Ghengis Kong
You ain't trying to rap with me go sing a song
Man rap is on a low , thanks to Drake
And if you mad at that line - jump in a lake
Hiphop is undead we eating , Zombie feast
But you dead to me relationship now deceased
Give it the blindfold cigarette call a priest
Firing squad you a lap dog im a fucking beast
Fight the power like ten thousand Chuck D's
Your chick will go far , i gave her cock feed
The ones on their knees are likely to succeed (suck seed)
Pearl necklace hot beads for you skets and tarts
And you arseholes won't do shit you just fart
I love my haters Bazinga im giving them the finger
