[Keyshia Cole]
Got me doing the things that I do, do
Ain't nobody treat me like you do, you
Keep me held down, when no one else is around
You show me love

[Verse 1: Rhymefest]
S-s-s-s so you say, used to diss me every day
Now she happy, Lil Scrappy, see me, she like, "OK-K"
Naw bitch naw, down with your drawers
You gon' need some Tylenol
For my head Tag Team said
"Take it to the house", naw, we gon' take it to the bed
And kick you out, put you out for the times you wasn't puttin' out
Take off your shoe, you finna put your foot in your mouth
I got my new ho, so what the fuck I'mma need you fo'?
Matter of fact I'mma need you to go
Hop back in your broke Yugo
And that go double for these bitch ass niggas
These snitch ass niggas, you just can't get rich ass niggas
Rhymemode's my crew
Sunday through Monday I'm out on the block
With of bundle of money like Russell who touchin' you
Wasn't you, nothin', who bustin' you lames?
So Pusha Man finna go out and get money

[Hook: Kanye West (w/ Bump J)]
Game gettin' unusual man
Go to war like Bush for change
You don't know, then you's a lame
(Man, I'm the pusha man)
Man, I'm the pusha man
(Man, I'm the pusha man)
You don't know, then you's a lame
Man, I'm the pusha man

[Verse 2: Bump J]
Get the O's and bag 'em up
Get the shit off fast as fuck
I give you a pack, you don't wanna get clapped
You better have my dust
Ask the hoes 'bout my pimp game
Spit game insane
Get brain while a nigga switch lane
Mom was short when the rent came
So her youngest boy had no choice but to go out and flip 'caine
Now I'm caught up in the mix man
I let a clip bang
Runnin' 'round lookin' for that big [stain?]
Hundred niggas gonna follow and the models
If it don't make dollars then it don't make sense, lame
Since the birth been hustlin'
I don't hurt for nothin'
Get rid of bricks like I work construction
If I ever kick off, front line with the iron, I'm the first one bustin'
If you ever run up I'mma hurt you cousin
Swisher Sweet full of that purple stuff then
Bump is on and it hurts you doesn't it?
Chump
I got my...

[Hook: Kanye West]

[Verse 3: Kanye West]
How can you say Kan is so pompous?
You ain't been to his concerts?
You just talking that nonsense
He in the same league Nas is
Or Jay is
My favorite
A lot of people say that's where 'Ye is
Though a freshman still the West man
One of the best, man, like Taye Diggs
And I was oh so patient
While niggas straight disrespectin' him
So I did what they ain't expect from him
Dropped The Dropout and blazed 'em
And ain't nobody feel my pain
Until the hits that I came with
I'm Kanye not Kayne
But to you, I'm Rick James bitch

[Hook: Kanye West]

[Verse 4: Bump J]
And they said I couldn't take it, said I wouldn't make it
Hate it that I'm this far
Hate to see Bump in that big car
But I flix hard when I spit bars
You gots to listen I come from the gutter
Do you know what it took to get these rocks to glisten?
On the block with biscuits I copped and pitched it
Back then I ain't have a pot to piss in
And to all my women that's caught up in the struggle
That gotta strip just to pay tuition
Baby daddy trippin', I feel your pain
If you don't know then you's a lame
I give you food for brain
And I'mma do my thang just like I'm supposed to
I had to quit the game, I used to flip the 'caine
Now I'm spittin' flames on these Pro Tools
Young bloods from my niggas in the old school
I know exactly what y'all gotta go through
Keep pushin' it's gonna go through
I'm yo proof

[Hook x2: Kanye West]
