I had a dream I could buy my way to heaven
Woke up, I spent it on a necklace
I told God I'd be back in a second
It's so hard not to act reckless
To whom much is given much is tested
Until they get the message
Now I'm under more scrutiny
But I act more stupidly
My momma couldn't get through to me
I'm talking like it's just you and me
I guess the money should've changed him
Should've forgot where he came from
So let the champagne splash
Let that man get past
You don't need to stop to get gas
If he can move through the rumors, he can drive off the fumes, cause
How do you move in a room full of no's?
How do you stay faithful in a room full of hoes?
He must be in tune with his soul
He's buried in a tomb full of gold
They'll be looking like "Why God?"
When they reminisce over you, my god
La, la, la, la
La, la, la, la
Wait till I get my money right
Then you can't tell me nothing right
