[Intro]
Let me get more volume
Nah, nah
Louder than my voice

[Verse]
Roll some, think I’ll roll some
To know some, if we both honest
Who lasts? yeah, you lie
Spent the whole summer
Tryna be at the wrong place at the right time
But I know what's mine when I see it
I know, I know, I know when I see it
Riding down the 405, baby
Pacing, thinking, to myself
If I should make it right
When I pulled up to the light
And then my phone started ringing
Diamonds in the colors of those eyes
Don’t know why, but I know a sign when I see it
