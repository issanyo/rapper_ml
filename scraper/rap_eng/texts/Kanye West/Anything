[Intro: Kanye West]
I mean wow. You know? Man

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Lookin' out my loft windows man my dreams became true
Lookin' at the mirror, wondering if it's the same dude
Lookin' at my closet wondering if it's all about clothes
Look right next to me, wondering if it's all about
Hop in the car and asked the OnStar where this life goes
And I drive so fast I blur the light post
They say Drive Slow, I say "I know"
Then errrr, away I go
And the way I flew
In this year or two
I know this is what God put me here to do
But in this excitement
You just might miss
A shorty with a demo like "Hey, you might like this"
And see
He
Remind me of me
Just a year ago
Now he
Tellin' me
I'm his her-ro-oh
I took his CD and asked him what he's lookin' for
He said, "Man, I don't know. Maybe a miracle"

[Verse 2: Patti Labelle]
Time, they say (true story, [kanye west])
There ain't no way
Your dreams are gone see the light of day
Don't believe
That you can't achieve
Whatever you're after
You can't be swayed
By the simple minds
That wanna hold you down
And in His time
The pain you carry
Will be left far behind

[Pre-Hook: (Patti Labelle) and Mary Mary]
If you listen to the sermons
And ask the Lord for guidance
You will see the many blessings (blessings you have received)
When you give Him all the glory (glory)
Gonna talk to, don't ignore thee (ignore thee)
Listen to all the stories
Meant to sing Your name

[Hook]
Don't let no one stand in your light
Change the way you feel inside
Nobody on this earth
Can tell you what your worth
Stand up, your the child of The King
And you can do anything

[Verse 3: Patti Labelle]
You try to please everyone
Time to live your life
Release those old illusions
Stop wasting time and
Start embracing
His light and let it shine

[Verse 4: Patti Labelle]
(Don't you listen) when they say
(You won't make it) oh it ain't no way
(Through the madness) never stop believing in yourself
In the morning you'll see
All the answers that free
You from chains that would seem
To keep you standing still

[Hook]
Don't let no one stand in your light
Change the way you feel inside
Nobody on this earth
Can tell you what your worth
Stand up, your the child of The King
And you can do anything

[Verse 5: Consequence]
I got an angel on my shoulder and I know he been warning me
To stay out the clubs where the police and warrants be
Cause that will lead to prison where the inmates and wardens be
But a lot of times we follow them when we know we ought to leave
And stay up in the party when we know that we ought to leave
But the women be callin' me
The liquor be callin' me
And what's the sense in Cons tippin' strippers named Diamond?
If he gonna be conflicted no different than diamonds
And the Lord is the only one that he can confide in
So I don't know how you think that you could deny Him
I open up the Book and the message is clear
But I still be in the hood so the pressure is there
To grab at that fast money just to get out of Queens
To bag up the work that they give out to fiends
But that ain't gonna work if I say what I mean
Cause at the end of the day I'm trying to Get Out My Dreams

[Hook x2]
Don't let no one stand in your light
Change the way you feel inside
Nobody on this earth
Can tell you what your worth
Stand up, your a child of The King
And I can do anything

[Outro]
Oh yes I can
Yes I can
I can do all things [?]
Nobody on this earth can tell you what you're worth
You're a child of The King
Never stop believing in yourself
The way you feel inside
Nobody on this earth
Stand up, stand up
And you can do anything
(Hallelujah)
