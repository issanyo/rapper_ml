[Verse 1: Alicia Keys]
Boy I said it once before
But baby I'm just making sure
I know that there is nothing more than you
So they can take it all away
I don't need it anyway
I just want another day with you

[Pre-Chorus: Alicia Keys]
Some people just don't know what they have
But boy I'm so glad I got you
Some people say they search all their life
But boy it's so nice I found you

[Chorus: Alicia Keys]
Some people want it all
I don't want nothing at all
If it ain't you baby
If I ain't got you baby
Some people want diamond rings
Some just want everything
It means nothing nothing
If I ain't got you

Ooh, you you you
Ooh, you you you
Ooh, you you you, you you you, you you you

[Verse 2: Alicia Keys]
So people looking forward to
The things they can't afford to do
All I'm looking forward to is you
You could never sacrifice
Boy you know I'm really fine
I would even give my life for you

[Pre-Chorus: Alicia Keys]
Some people just don't know what they have
But boy I'm so glad I got you
Some people say they search all their life
But boy it's so nice I found you

[Chorus: Alicia Keys]
Some people want it all
I don't want nothing at all
If it ain't you baby
If I ain't got you baby
Some people want diamond rings
Some just want everything
It means nothing nothing
If I ain't got you

Ooh, you you you
Ooh, you you you
Ooh, you you you, you you you, you you you

Ooh, you you you
Ooh, you you you
Ooh, you you you, you you you, you you you

[Spoken Interlude: Alicia Keys]
Uh, yeah
That's how I feel
I wanna say more but
The last record I did with Kanye
Talked your ear off so, hahahaha
All I wanna say is

[Sung Interlude: Alicia Keys]
Baby, baby
Nothing in this whole wide world
Don't mean a thing
I ain't got you with me

[Chorus: Alicia Keys]
Some people want it all
I don't want nothing at all
If it ain't you baby
If I ain't got you baby
Some people want diamond rings
Some just want everything
It means nothing nothing
If I ain't got you

Ooh, you you you
Ooh, you you you
Ooh, you you you, you you you, you you yo
