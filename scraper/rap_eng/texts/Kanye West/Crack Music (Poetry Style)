[Verse 1]
How we stop the Black Panthers?
Ronald Reagan cooked up an answer
And people say, “Oh, Ronald Reagan’s that president”
But type “Black Panther” and “Ronald Reagan”
And see what you get
Being that he was the governor of L.A
Ronald Reagan cooked up an answer
You hear that? What Gil-Scott was hearing
Why all our heroes and heroines end up on heroin?
Crack raised the murder rate in D.C. and Maryland
We invested in that; it’s like we got Merrill lynched
And we been hanging from the same tree ever since
Sometimes I feel the music is the only medicine
So we cook it, cut it, measure it, bag it, sell it
The fiends cop it; nowadays, they can’t tell if…
That’s that good shit? We ain’t sure, man
Put the CD on your tongue; yeah, that’s pure, man

[Chorus]
That’s that crack music
That real Black music
La la la la la la la la
La la la la la la

[Verse 2]
From the place where the fathers gone
The mothers is hardly home
And the maricóns lock us up in the Audy Home
How the Mexicans say? “We just trying to party, homes”
Who gave Saddam anthrax?
George Bush got the answers
Back in the hood, it's a different type of chemical
Arm & Hammer baking soda; raised they whole quota
Right when our soldiers ran for the stove 'cause
'Cause… dreams of being Hova
Went from being a broke man to being a dopeman
To being the President; look, there's hope man
This that inspiration for the Moes and the folks man
Shorty come and see his momma straight overdosing
And this is the soundtrack
This the type of music that you make when you 'round that
Crack music!
