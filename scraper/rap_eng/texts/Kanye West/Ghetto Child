Shoutout to Reflex for bringing me this sample. Any and everybody who helped with the Be album, we brought back that real hip-hop shit. This is one of the greatest times of my life. You know we workin' on a new joint "Finding Forever" right now, be in stores this summer. Depending on what year you're listening to this mixtape, it might've been in stores last summer, depending on what year that is. I won't say the year because Extra P told me don't say the year. So from now, till forever baby "Finding Forever". Hi boys and girls, I always wanted to say that over this sample, I have nothing else to say though. Hooooo!
