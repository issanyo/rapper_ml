[Intro: Kanye West & Quavo]
When I came up had to show my ass, yeah
Clothes tight, clothes tight, hoes tight, hold tight
Hold tight, hold tight
Hold tight, hold tight
Hold tight, hold tight
Hold tight, hold tight
And I just figured out the whole time
Uh, I was actin' like I'm white

[Verse 1: Quavo & Kanye West]
When I came up, had to show my ass, yeah, that's the black side
I was trappin' out the bando, nosy ass neighbors uptight
When I come around, when I come around, niggas don't act right
I'm yellin' out, "Please don't come with that fake shit," screamin' it all night
What the fuck did you say? What the fuck did you say? (ayy, uh)
I'm on my Wraith shit, I'm on my, I'm on my Wraith shit (race, yep, woo)
Get the fuck out my face, get out of my way (move, fuck did you say?)
I'm on my Wraith shit, I fell in love with all races (race, yep)
When you're aiming for something I tell 'em
Hold tight, hold tight, hold tight
When you're aiming for something I tell 'em
Hold tight, hold tight, hold tight
When you're aiming for something I tell 'em
Hold tight, see that melody right there? That's why I'm me
When you're aiming for something I tell 'em

[Verse 2: Kanye West & (Quavo)]
I be actin' like I'm white (white)
Fuckin' white bitches, black and white dick (oh, ayy)
[?] like we don't tiki talk shit, bossed up
100 bump, I do that shit all night
Sniff a line
I be sniffing Miley Cyrus with Miley Cyrus
In a bathroom with my thumb in her ass
Now I'm actin' like I'm white

[Pre-Chorus: Kanye West  & Quavo]
You stayed 3 exes up and you never came to see me in my own room
You the only good enough for the mountain
Only good as the people you got around you
This is all associations around you
I only got [?] but never doubt you
Forgive me if I ever doubted you
Forgive me if I ever doubted you
Forgive me if I ever doubted you
Forgive me if I ever doubted you
Forgive me if I ever doubted you
Please forgive me if I ever doubted you
Forgive me if I ever doubted you
Please forgive me if I ever doubted you
Forgive me if I ever doubted you
Please forgive me if I ever doubted you
Forgive me if I ever doubted you

[Chorus: Quavo]
Ayy, 'cause I'm actin' like I'm white
Don't make me show my ass, that's the black side
Yeah, I'm actin' like I'm white
Don't make me show my ass, that's the black side
'Cause I'm actin' like I'm white
Don't make me show my ass, that's the black side
Yeah, I'm actin' like I'm white
Don't make me show my ass, that's the black side

[Verse 3: Young Thug]
I'm chillin', pourin' up until I can't feel my anger
Blessed my nigga Yeezy with a banger
I was sharin' all my thoughts with a stranger
Wrestle this bitch like Kurt, no Angle
I can see them diamonds drippin' off me like a sink
Act inside a pineapple mango
She been in the [?] with no angle
Whoop, I'm adios, as-salamu alaykum (nigga, that that)
I just want a round house, we gon' have 'em bleedin'
Nah, I ain't green, sharin' is carin', bae, I be just feedin'
Coca Cola shape, I don't want to fuck it bae, I just want see it
Lil nigga late, I been done did but you just ain't see it
Wait, lil' nigga, I can afford it
I just was broke with no shawty
I just found out it's important
To take off the factories and put on some Forgies
I got six rings, I'm just lordin'
I used to be broke and so boring (broke, borin', yeah)
I came out that swamp, can't ignore it (yeah)
Now all my pockets is on Norbit

[Verse 4: Takeoff]
They mad 'cause we grinded up from the top
I was on the block, no guap, runnin' from cops
They talk about me, they wanted to see the album flop
And we will never stop, the game on Buscemi lock
I do wrong and do right, forgive me for not livin' right
Sippin' on Bud, like givin' you advice I'm actin' white
Mansion on acres, my white friends I only invite
Even when I'm wrong, it feel like a nigga right

[Verse 5: Quavo]
Dr. King sacrificed his life (King)
Because they didn't treat us right (no)
Don't call a young nigga racist because my best friend white (white)
Yeah, my best friend's white (ayy), white (uh)

[Verse 6: Offset]
I was actin' like I'm white (white)
Diamonds shinin' off the lights (shine)
Pain came with the limelight (pain)
Feds put me in the spotlight (feds)
Mama told me that these bitches ain't never gon' count (these bitches don't count)
'Cut you off, don't wanna talk, I'ma see you around (I see you around)
This is the way that we kick it (we kick it)
200 thou' in my kitchen (200 racks)
Bad bitches in the facility (bad bitches)
I put my hoe on a mission (ayy)
Y'all niggas better hold tight (hold tight)
I gave 200 to Jews, told 'em make it right (make it right)
They mad, we blew up like dynamite (mad)
I can see everythin' like a satellite (I can see)
