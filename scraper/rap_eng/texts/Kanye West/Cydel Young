Cydel Young they feel me in Belgium
And when I die I'm going back to the heavens I fell from
I fell from
Back to the heavens I fell from
Cydel Young they feel me in Belgium
And when I die I'm going back to the heavens I fell from
Back to the heavens I fell from
Back (back) to the heavens I fell from

[Verse 1: CyHi The Prynce]
My father named me Cydel
My momma pushed out a diamond
Took out the del off my name and put the H-I behind it
That's CY-HI short for your HIghness
Then I added The Prynce
So you know where my mind is
My sister asked me when I'm goin' to get married
When it's affordable to get my wife six carats
Supposed to have a brother but my mother had a miscarriage
So every blessing he was supposed to get i'll inherit
I really wanted to be an athlete
So, it's the Olympics every time me and the track meet
I'm so ahead of my time I'm finna lap me
I know the Lord is Thy Shepherd though I'm the black sheep
I ain't gotta act street you can ask V
It was nothing to get off of key
Like a wack beat
I hit the gas let the 'lac creep
My partner riding shotgun same thing was in the back seat
I ain't worried bout niggas sayin' I'm wack
Cuz when I was in the traps
Some niggas really tried to wack me
Ya don't really know the feeling
Prynce ain't from Queens
But I've seen supreme dope dealing
King pin shit in this ring there's no squealing
Disciplined gangsters no women no children
At the age of nineteen I had the coupe no ceiling
Selling fruit while I'm bumping number two Lord Willin
If I ever make a million
I don't want to lose it all; Curt Schillings
I got a homie who didn't deserve prison
Tried to tell him that the man he killed wasn't worth killing
But that's the life of a young goon
When it rains it pours caught in a monsoon
I'm hoping that his day come soon
Memories of us rapping beatin' on the table in the lunchroom

Cydel Young they feel me in Belgium
And when I die I'm going back to the heavens I fell from
I fell from

Cydel Young they feel me in Belgium
And when I die I'm going back to the heavens I fell from
Back to the heavens I fell from
Back (back) to the heavens I fell from

[Verse 2: CyHi The Prynce]
Cydel Young homie I'm seldom
Seen in the club because i go to sleep like at 12 sumthin'
I used to sell plums
I'm used to the bail bonds
Man you niggas actin' like going to jail's fun
When Butchy got shot I instantly felt numb
We was like fifteen when we first held guns
But beef can get you killed though
At least for twenty years when you gotta lot at stake
It's gotta be well done
Tales from a place where ain't no fair ones
This my gift from God my nigga you welcome
A buncha rappers bootleggin' my rhymes
These niggas tryinta illegally sell rum
But they liquor is cheap
Rapping like Iâ€™m in a gym
Working on my figure of speech
I'm going back to the original me
Back before all my friends shitted on me
Playin' sideline bus in the middle the street
Before my girlfriend became a miserable freak
One man's trash is another man's treasure
And I mean that, literally
I was cool with the killers and thieves
Got black eyes from fist fights they tried to Forest Whitaker me
But I survived shorty I survived
I knew I would be famous my nigga I'm not surprised
Came a long way from hamburgers and apple pies
I was so broke sometimes I couldn't ask for fries
But I knew that God had a plan for me
All the problems in my life made a man of me
Took three bags to my folks at Scott-dale
Came back with like twenty grand on me
Call me watcha want
Just don't put your hands on me
I'm Cyhi but everybody on Redan know me as

[Hook]
Cydel Young they feel me in Belgium
And when I die I'm going back to the heavens I fell from
I fell from
Back to the heavens I fell from
Cydel Young they feel me in Belgium
And when I die I'm going back to the heavens I fell from
Back to the heavens I fell from
Back (back) to the heavens I fell from
