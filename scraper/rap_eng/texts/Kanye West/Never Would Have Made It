[Intro]
Never would have made it
Never would have made it without you

[Chorus]
You are the highlight of my life
You are the sunshine in my night
Oh how, oh how, oh, how do I
Ever repay you

[Verse 1]
Finally, I know what I want
I learned from my mistakes and my heartbreaks
The road to hell was paved with good intentions
No matter which way you, no matter which way you take

[Pre-Chorus]
Never truly follow my heart
Made a lot of decisions based on everyone but me
But now, I'm strong enough to let it go
I'm wise enough to take control
My mama told me everything
My mama told me everything I know

[Chorus]
You are the highlight of my life
You are the sunshine in my night
Oh how, oh how, oh, how do I
Ever repay you

[Bridge]
Stand up, press forward, move on
Don't cry, we'll make it through the night
For sure

[Chorus]
You are the highlight of my life
You are the sunshine in my night
Oh how, oh how, oh, how do I
Ever repay you

[Outro]
Never would have made it
Never would have made it without you
