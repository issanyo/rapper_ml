[Intro: T-Pain]
Ahhhhhh! Take a sip of this
Ayyy, let's go {*beatboxing and skatting*}
I want you to feel this beat baby
I'm not tired, let's go! {*beatboxing and skatting*}

[T-Pain]
Listen (whassup?) This ain't the way I wanted it to end
But I gotta go - gotta get missing!
You ain't gotta kick me out, I'll get out my own house
But you still need to get yo' shit together girl

[Interlude]
What do I do, what do I say?
Gotta get us back to the way that we used to be back in the day
Who do I call to talk to?
Shorty you ain't gotta be scared of me, all we need is therapy

[Hook: T-Pain]
Like 1-2-3-4, get the hell up out my door
5-6-7-8, I don't need your sex I'll masturbate
9-10-11-12, you can go to hell all I care
Yeahhhh
Can't do it shorty, can't deal with you babe
Can't handle the pressure of you - yeah yeah
Can't do it shorty, can't deal with you babe
Can't handle the pressure of you - yeah yeah

[T-Pain]
Listen (whassup?) I know you ain't used to us being friends
But I gotta go - no more kissing!
You ain't gotta go away, but I know I can not stay
Cause you still gonna get yo' shit together girl

[Interlude] + [Hook]

[Kanye West]
Ohhhhh, ohhhh; ohhh you too much pressure doll
You gon' raise my cholesterol
I gotta lower the phone decibels
Just to talk, just a thought
I'mma get a girl with a ass just as soft
You swear men dogs like reservoir and I was Mr. Pink
Remember those nights on the kitchen sink
I was choking you in a good way, good way
Now we in the streets and I'm chokin you in a hood way
When the cops come what I could say?
You know how all that gossip is
Next morning Bossip, Perez
Any girl I take out, Mediatakeout, I need a break now
Before I break now (ah ah ah ah)
Show me your Janet Jacksons if you nasty
You said you want to cut my nuts off like Jesse Jackson, classy
Ohhh, why she say that, OUCH~!
Bitch, give me back my couch
On that same couch casting
Now listen to T-Pain and sing

[Hook]

[T-Pain]
BETTER GET OUT MY FACE BITCH!
