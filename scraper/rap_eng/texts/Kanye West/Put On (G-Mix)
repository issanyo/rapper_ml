[Intro: Young Jeezy]
Rest in peace, homie
Lil Mike, let's go
I put on (ay Cliff)
I put on (yeah, "The Recession" on the way)
I put on (ay Young)
The Recession on the way, hey, but on another note
A lot of sounding like Young, tell 'em register to quote
See I rolled them back-to-back like I'm registered to smoke
Yeah I got it on me now but I ain't registered to tote

[Verse 1: Ludacris]
You could ask Dallas Austin you could ask Rico Wayde
I kept the lights on in Atlanta when Goody and Cash took a break
And you can say that "he this" and you can say that "he that,"
But one thing's for damn sure I put the city on my back
And I ain’t goin' nowhere that movin' money ain't changed em'
But the vaults were too small at the bank so I rearranged em'
These rappers around my way ain't got mo’ money then me
I’m blinded by my own ice but I got mo' money to see
And I ain’t dissin' I’m just spittin’ what I call is the truth!
So catch me ridin' without that thang what you call is the roof!
I got the money in my palms like I carved the Malouf!
Cuz I gotta make myself clear just like a bottle of Goose!
And I can see right through ya
Don’t let the mic fool ya
Say the wrong words and my click might do ya
So before you go runnin' your mouth and say some shit you'll regret
This is just a small verse so that these boys don't forget
I put on

[Hook: Young Jeezy]
I put on, I put on, I put on
I put on for my city, on-on for my city
I put on for my city, on-on for my city
I put on for my city, on-on for my city
I put on for my city, on-on for my city

[Verse 2: Young Jeezy]
When they see me off in traffic they say "Jeezy on some other shit"
Send them pussy niggas runnin' straight back to the dealership
Me, I'm in my spaceship, that's right, I work for NASA
This FNH is not a fraud, call that bitch my bodyguard
"Call that bitch your bodyguard?" Yeah, that's my bodyguard
Wear a lot of jewelry, Young don't do security
What's whiter than a napkin, harder than a dinner plate?
If you want it, come and get it, you know I stay super straight
Ran up in my spots and now I'm working out the Super 8
Know you niggas hungry, come and get a super plate
Y'all sing happy birthday, yeah, I got that super cake
Hundred karat bracelet, I use it like some super bait

[Hook: Young Jeezy]
I put on for my city, on-on for my city
I put on for my city, on-on for my city
Put on (Eastside) put on (Southside)
Put on (Westside) put on, let's go!
I put on for my city, on-on for my city
I put on for my city, on-on for my city
Put on (Eastside) put on (Southside)
Put on (Westside) put on, let's go!

[Interlude: Jay-Z + (Young Jeezy)]
'Ey Guru, put a lil' T-Pain on my shit too
Clear my throat, know what I mean? Uh
I put on... G-Mix
I don't need no T-Pain, I got this one
(Oh you bout to put on Hov?) Yes

[Verse 3: Jay-Z]
I put Marcy on the map, I put Brooklyn on my back
I put Fab back on the charts, I put Biggie in my raps
I put Nas with Def Jam, I let Diddy do my tracks
I put on for my city, that's a motherfucking fact
I put Mike Jack' on stage at Summer Jam, "Billie Jean"
I put Prodigy in his place on that Summer Jam screen
I put Preme in my truck told him leave them streets alone
I predicted jail would happen, shit, I tried to put him on
All these niggas taking credit for the work that I put in
If you really put me on, put yourself on then
I put miles on that hooptie, I put hours in that kitchen
Put that on my "Dear Mama" this is fact not fiction
Feds were trying to build a case, I was headed for conviction
Til the greatest flow in the world put me on television
I put on for my city so when I'm dead and gone
I got one last wish: put my Yankee hat on

[Hook: Young Jeezy]
I put on for my city, on-on for my city
I put on for my city, on-on for my city
Put on (Eastside) put on (Southside)
Put on (Westside) put on, let's go
I put on for my city, on-on for my city
I put on for my city, on-on for my city
Put on (Eastside) put on (Southside)
Put on (Westside) put on, let's go

[Bridge: Kanye West]
I put on, I put on, I put on
I put on for my city, I put on for my
I put on for my city, I put on for my city
On

[Verse 4: Kanye West]
I feel like it's still niggas that owe me checks
I feel like it's still bitches that owe me sex
I feel like this but niggas don't know he's stressed
I lost the only girl in the world that know me best
I got the money and the fame, man, that don't mean shit
I got the Jesus on a chain, man, that don't mean shit
Cause when the Jesus pieces can't bring me peace
Yo, I need just at least, uh, one of Russell's nieces
On, I let my nightmares go
I put on everybody that I knew from the 'Go
I know hoes that was frontin' when they knew he was broke
They say, "Damn, Yeezy Yeezy, you don't know us no more?"
"You got that big fame, homie, and you just changed on me"
You can ask big homie, man, the top so lonely
I ain't lyin
So lonely, I ain't lyin!
Let me see what we have tonight (what we have tonight)
I'm high as a satellite (satellite)
I see those flashing lights (flashing lights)
Cause every night, every night, I put on

[Hook: Young Jeezy]
I put on for my city, on-on for my city
I put on for my city, on-on for my city
Put on (Eastside) put on (Southside)
Put on (Westside) put on, let's go!
I put on for my city, on-on for my city
I put on for my city, on-on for my city
Put on (Eastside) put on (Southside)
Put on (Westside) put on, let's go!

[Outro: Kanye West]
Let me see what we have tonight
I'm high as a satellite
I see those flashing lights
Cause every night, every night
Let me see what we have tonight
I'm high as a satellite
I see those flashing lights
