AJ Calloway: First of all I got to say you all look absolutely fantastic

Kim Kardashian West: Thank you

Kanye West: Thank you so much

AJ Calloway: Are you excited about tonight?

KW: Very very excited

AJ Calloway: Who do you wanna see inside with the performances? Whats going on?

KW: I like to see Madonna perform

KKW:  Yeah

KW: John Legend

KKW: I'm excited to see Kanye perform "Only One". I know everyone is really hyped to see the Paul McCartney RIhanna performance, but I am psyched to see the solo. That'll be really special

AJ Calloway: At Superbowl, that was an amazing performance. I saw you watched it, she liked turned in to a fan. I've never seen Kim watch you perform

KW: What?! She's come to a few shows before. Before we were together. That's how I got her. I put on a whole Watch The Throne concert to court Kim Kardashian, turn her in to Kim Kardashian West. I need Jay Z to be my rap partner, I need a cube with some shark tanks, it worked out

AJ Calloway: I gotta say congratulations to you, I was there for the BET honours and the award that you were given it was absolutely incredible, how did that make you feel, being honoured in that way?

KW: Sometimes it feels funny cause I've had to deal with so much, you know, negative energy and misunderstood and I really had to just put my words together, I'm not not only not just about myself, I'm about humanity, how can we make the world better with what I do, with my music or my presentation, clothing, what I do, I think it's cool

AJ Calloway: Y'all been enjoying the week, I saw you at the Roc Nation brunch, that's like, I mean, the couples, you had Jay and Bey, you all, Rihanna in the building, just takes it to an overload

KKW:  It was fun. It's the Grammy's weekend, I am just here with him

KW: It was like the old Puff white parties, it was like freak-nick, you know. It's finally good to get some real culture and soul and people just coming together again
