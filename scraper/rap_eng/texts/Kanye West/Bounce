[Verse 1: Rhymefest]
Bounce my nigga
You dont want no beef with these Chi-town niggas
You ain't got the phlegm for the four-pound spitters
Underground underneath everything that glitters
Still gold, still selling 500 thousand
Not satisfied till we push another thousand
Park the vehicle right in front of public housing
So the shorties with nigga half
?????
Run a little math and
Count that paper
???
Bounce back later
Have green parties but not Ralph Nader
Black like Darth Vader
You know me, ain’t squeeze, talk later
“That’s my baby”
What my mama say when I got her that Mercedes
Make that old woman feel like a young lady
That’s crazy
I went from broke as a yoke to no jokin homie just ???

[Hook: “Can't Give You Anything (But My Love)” by The Stylistics]
If I had money I'd go out
Buy you furs, dress you like a queen
And in a chauffeured limousine
We'd look so fine
But I'm an ordinary guy
And my pockets are empty

[Verse 2: Rhymefest]
You want to know what the Midwest is?
Wild and restless where reckless niggas might snap ya necklace
And next them niggas might jack ya Lexus
Whole blocks fighting over blocks like Tetris
That’s so foolish
We finna flip the rocks and stocks ???
Buy everybody computers
Every ride is the newest, every chick be the nudest
Doin’ it for ourselves
Ya'll know how them crackers do it
So you bounce my nigga
??
Like we smoke an ounce my nigga
???
We about to flip the game
Equip the ??
Buy three houses
And we decorate our cribs the same
So take that witcha
Starving artists naw man
Paint that picture
??? Got my film
Can't get richer
Standin’ by me
Without a deal
Making this mil

[Hook x2]
