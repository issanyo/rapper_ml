Franchise, Crosby, American dream
All-star point guard, third year in the lead
First round, number-two pick, the heart of the team
I done set and watch 'em jump off the screen
I done seen and shaken [?] shoes
Fake baseline, [still and step and pull up a tomb??]
It's the franchise, I'll leave a tooth in the game
Boy comes straight out of D.C. doing his thing
The terrapin off in Maryland, chocolate leaves
So [I'll pertain they're 'bout to drop him a sleeve??]
I'm Scarface from the [age dark?], king of the block
"We are one" on my t-shirt and shoes are Reebok
And the streets rock what we rock, the battle is won
Crossbender with the franchise, you know I was done
It's like this, it's like that, it's like this and uh
It's like this, it's like that, it's like this and uh
It's like that, it's like this, it's like that and uh
It's like this, it's like that, it's like that and uh

Def Jam sound, baby!
