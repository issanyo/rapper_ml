[Verse 1]
I'm like Twista on the rap side
I'm like weave on the track side
I'm Don Juan on the mack side
I'm Michael Jordan, Scottie Pippen and Pac's son
I'm Phil Jackson, this is South Side
They call me Kan', the Louis Vuitton don
But I still might throw on a little (?) on
Same place where the (?) from
Same place I got my flows from
Place I got my hoes from
Talkin', tell me if you know somethin'
Go on 'head, roll somethin'
Bitches get they (?) on when you turn Luke on
Gangstas dance, but they still get they (?) on
Bad Boys II on and she want to go
I'm a cop the bootleg from it for the show
Watch the DVD in the car cause the way a nigga live
We have more TVs in the whip than in the crib
My nigga sells cellphones, we call him Lil' Flip
Welcome to Chicago, my city is the shit
