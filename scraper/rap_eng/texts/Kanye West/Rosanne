[Hook: GLC]
From that one twelve to
That two twenty four
To that four forty eight
Watch a player get straight
Got that Rosanne
Cause a player got weight
Call me Lieutenant Dan
Cause I got that Rosanne

[Verse 1: GLC]
Started with that 28
Moved it up to 56
Buck 50 crocodile hunter out here taking risks
I saw the video for Promise just like 50 Cent
Now I wanna hit Ciera just like 50 Cent
Call me Tom Cruise I'm on risky biz
Pulling hoes buying clothes And taking risks
Hit the Swaporama to get my ruler kit
Got another one from folks cause he wasn't using it
We was wearing Coogi the first time around
Now you wearing Coogi only cause the price come down
I got the Spizzikes you got the replicas
We up several flights please don't try to step with us
And we keep that pot call it Harry Potter
And we wearing minks you wearing a hairy otter
A German Shepard a sheared possum
I'm Batman you in Gotham
And we up them things not no boomerangs
And we talk our own language just like
Pooty Tang tippy tow why you tripping now
At first it was a drought but now the block is tipping now

[Hook: GLC]
From that one twelve to
That two twenty four
To that four forty eight
Watch a player get straight
Got that Rosanne
Cause a player got weight
Call me Lieutenant Dan
Cause I got that Rosanne
From that one twelve

[Verse 2: GLC]
Got it up to two two four
Them people watching me
My life is like the Truman Show
Rap phenomenon nigga ask Big O
Shoot that money dog
Tell me what they hitting for
A new car tons of reefer
And it's always selling out
Call it  Condoleezza
No we never bailing out I'm my brothers keeper
When I get to BET imma bone Juliesa
Yep I'm a young and eager
But I'm driving slow
I can take you through the Go and back
With my eyes closed
In another city traffic take the side roads
But we bringing all that traffic through
The side doors
I'm GLC like [?] Washington
I run the city I got the block on ten
Fuck you if you never thought that I can win
You ain't a hustler I expose you
I can not pretend
