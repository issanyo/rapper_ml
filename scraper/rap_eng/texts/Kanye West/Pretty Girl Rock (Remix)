[Intro: Keri Hilson]
I can do the pretty girl rock, rock
Rock to the pretty girl rock, rock, rock

[Verse 1: Keri Hilson]
My name is Keri, I'm so very
Fly, oh my, it's a little bit scary
Boys wanna marry, looking at my derrière
You can stare, but if you touch it, I'ma bury
Pretty as a picture
Sweeter than a swisher
Mad 'cause I'm cuter than the girl that's with ya
I ain't gotta talk about it, baby you can see it
But if you want, I'll be happy to repeat it

[Verse 2: Keri Hilson]
My name is Keri, I'm so very
Fly, oh my, it's a little bit scary
Boys wanna marry, looking at my derrière
You can stare but if you touch it I'mma bury
Pretty as a picture
Sweeter than a swisher
Mad 'cause I'm cuter than the girl that's with ya
I can talk about it 'cause I know that I'm pretty
And if you know it too, then ladies sing it with me

[Chorus: Keri Hilson]
All eyes on me when I walk in
No question that this girl's a ten
Don't hate me 'cause I'm beautiful
Don't hate me 'cause I'm beautiful
My walk, my talk, the way I drip
It's not my fault, so please don't trip
Don't hate me 'cause I'm beautiful
Don't hate me 'cause I'm beautiful

[Verse 3: Kanye West]
For the nigga, they love to hate
But all the bad model girls, they love to date
You need to check my swag and get up to date
Check, check, check my swag and get up to date
Cause when we cut, I'm razor blading
I'm so lazer, I'm so major
I'm so Flava, I'm so Flava
Baby, I should have a clock on
While ya get ya, get ya, get ya pretty girl rock on
For all my girls from Atlanta out to Stockholm
And they looking like "what the hell you got on?"
"What you mean, babygirl? I got homes!"
Different cribs, new whips
And I'm feelin fly, fly like a G6
Fly, my swag hit on ladies unknowingly
Pleased to meet ya, its a pleasure knowing me
Back when I was poor I used to pull em with my poetry
Tick that yes or no for me, I guarantee she go with me
But the only thing I need to know right now's
What a pretty girl like you doing in this part of town
With a city girl swag and a country girl smile
I mean, you demoralizing bitches with your style
Wow, well how about now?
My jewelry so loud, my girls so wow
I mean, I mean swag so loud
I guess thats the reason all the concerts sell out

[Post-Chorus: Keri Hilson & Kanye West]
Aye, now do the pretty girl rock, rock, rock
Do the pretty girl rock, rock, rock
Do the pretty girl rock, rock
All my ladies do the pretty girl rock, rock, rock
Do the pretty girl rock, rock, rock
Do the pretty girl rock, rock, rock
Do the pretty girl rock
Now where you at?

[Verse 4: Keri Hilson]
If you're looking for me you can catch me (hot spot)
Cameras flashing, daddy's turned his head as soon as I passed him
Girls think I'm conceited 'cause I know I'm attractive
Don't worry about what I think, why don't you ask him?
Get yourself together don't hate (never do it)
Jealousy's the ugliest trait (don't ever do it)
I can talk about it 'cause I know that I'm pretty
And if you know it too, then ladies sing it with me

[Chorus: Keri Hilson]
All eyes on me when I walk in
No question that this girl's a ten
Don't hate me 'cause I'm beautiful
Don't hate me 'cause I'm beautiful
My walk, my talk, the way I drip
It's not my fault, so please don't trip
Don't hate me 'cause I'm beautiful
Don't hate me 'cause I'm beautiful

[Outro: Keri Hilson]
All eyes on me when I walk in
No question that this girl's a ten
Don't hate me 'cause I'm beautiful
Don't hate me 'cause I'm beautiful
My walk my talk the way I dress
It's not my fault so please don't trip
Don't hate me cause I'm beautiful
Don't hate me cause I'm beautiful
