Sitting on a runway, time on my hands, thinking of you again
As I replay our conversations, pray that everything fell in place
Like a mirror lookin' back at me, sayin' you're the only one
Makin' me feel I could survive, so glad to be alive
Nowhere to run, I got a song to sing
Messed up inside and it's been raining all day

[Chorus]
Since you went away, Southside serenade
Since you went away, Southside serenade

[Bridge]
South-south-southside, southside
South-southside, southside
South-southside

[Chorus]
Since you went away, Southside serenade
Since you went away, Southside serenade
South-south-southside
