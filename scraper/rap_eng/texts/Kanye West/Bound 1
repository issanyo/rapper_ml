[Hook: Charlie Wilson]
I know you're tired of loving, of loving
With nobody to love, nobody, nobody

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
What you doing in the club on a Thursday?
She say she only here for her girl birthday
Okay, the hundreds here, [?] Thursday
They ordered champagne, why they look thirsty?
I know I got a bad reputation
Walking 'round, always mad reputation
Leave a pretty girl sad reputation
Start a Fight Club, Brad reputation
Success, and it's time for [?]
It's like the first time back in the basement
[?]
[?]
Uh, this that prom shit
This that what we do, don't tell your mom shit
This that red cup, all on the lawn shit
Got a fresh cut, straight out the salon, bitch

[Hook: Charlie Wilson]
I know you're tired of loving, of loving
With nobody to love, nobody, nobody
So just grab somebody, no leaving this party
With nobody to love, nobody, body

[Outro: Charlie Wilson]
Yeah
I know you're tired of loving, of loving
With nobody to love, nobody, nobody
Just grab somebody, no leaving this party
With nobody to love, nobody, nobody
