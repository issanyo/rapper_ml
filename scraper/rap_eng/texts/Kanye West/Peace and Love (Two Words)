[Verse 1]
Lo- Lord, the air is foul with the smell of hypocrisy
As bloody armies scream- screams for victory
Lying there in the mire is a mama and child
Their anguished cries trampled by boots on either side

[Solo]

[Verse 2]
Now with bloodshot eyes we look out beyond earth's gate
Seeking new planets to plant seeds of hate, yeah
Progress, it's said, makes for a softer bed, mmm
But no one will lie easy if everyone lies dead
Now it's time, I think, and I think you'll agree, oh
To love thy neighbor and set all men free
So take the shackles from the wings of the dying dove
And permit her to fly away to peace and love, yeah

[Instrumental Outro]
