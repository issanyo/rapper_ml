[Verse 1: Rythmatik]
We are living in a 33rd Century, Futuristic space dome
We flyer than the Jetsons,and rock harder than Flintstones
Man I'm feeling like leopold, We uphold the code
We the race that was given the power centuries old
So I'm power tripping these hoes
I'm power steering that rarri', so everybody go home
You don't deserve to flow, you don't deserve to flow
Like penises after steroids, you don't deserve to grow
No one man should have all that power
Either I'm making it rain, or the world is my shower
No one man should have such big hands
To jump off stage, and grab all that ass
Fuck the mask, I'm gonna fuck you raw
I don't hear that jazz, like I'm hating on Utah
Niggas see me ball, they be like, who you? Paul?
Telekinetic dick, I give a fuck what you thought
Got bitches lke Pam, Anderson, Dash, Stacey
Cuz' this lil nigga a star, like the red kind from Macy's
I'm Hercules with this hot shit, flowing str8 outta Hades
Like Yeezy, I got that crack, Like I took a trip to the 80's
Predicted they was gone hate me, when I went and took a listen
To the shit that I be dripping, on these rap game hypocrites
Critical to illiterates, Hit em with my benevolent dick
Leave a pussy nigga irrelevant quick
No one man should have all that legroom
Two bitches in the coupe, I need headroom
Lord forgive me I'm a sinner
But with all this gold, I'm looking more like a winner
Im hot as hell, so I'm guessing I'm set for wintr
That luis V got me feeling like Luis V in the winter
It's a dash for the cash, and I'm an African sprinter
You T-Mobile? Well, a nigga's eating bars for dinner
I'm appalled at you niggas, I'm appalled at you niggas
I go to Mars on you niggas, I go to Mars on you niggas
I'm on my spacecraft, Et'ing your cycling ass
Stuck in a loop, target the coupe, when they see me drive past
This is the, future that I see, future that is me
Erasing all infidelity, there's no telling me
Nothing, nothing, you ain't saying nothing

[Hook 1]

[Verse 2]
I Lucille ball, in every State, Church, Mall
Penitentiary, University, And State Park
My flow ill, till it's un-dead, creeping outta the morgue
My flow dejavu, its like I, been here before
Like I'm fucking with a past life
Dick hard like I been fucking with ya past wife
But you ain't no ass right? Fuck around and get smoked
And blasted right into the past, your irrelevant ass, goodnight
2 packs of condoms on your bitch? Now that's a good night!
2 Pacs of condoms on your bitch? Now that's a Suge Knight
Now you mad, 'cuz you can't do it like I could right?
[Devil's Bad Bitch Reference]

[Hook 2]
All my bitches do is, fuck and sleep, but we don't sleep
We be up all night, trying to get things right
Nigga, we don't sleep
If you know me, you know we don't sleep
