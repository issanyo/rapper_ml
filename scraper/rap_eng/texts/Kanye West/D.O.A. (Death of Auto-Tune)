[Intro]
La-da da dah, hey-ayy-ayy, goodbyeeee...
(Good riddance) hol' up!

[Chorus]
Only rapper to rewrite history without a pen
No I.D. on the track let the story begin, begin, begin

[Verse 1]
This is anti-auto-tune, death of the ringtone
This ain’t for iTunes, this ain’t for sing-alongs
This is Sinatra at the opera, bring a blonde
Preferably with a fat ass who can sing a song, wrong
This ain't politically correct (uhh!)
This might offend my political connects (uhh!)
My raps don’t have melodies
This should make niggas wan' go and commit felonies (uhh!)
Get your chain tooken
I may do it myself, I’m so Brooklyn! (uhh!)
I know we facing a recession
But the music y’all making gon' make it the Great Depression (uhh!)
All y’all lack aggression
Put your skirt back down, grow a set man (uhh, uhh!)
Nigga this shit violent
This is death of auto-tune, moment of silence

[Chorus]
La-da da dah, hey-ayy-ayy, goodbyeeee... hol' up
Only nigga to re-write history without a pen
No I-D on the track let the story begin, begin, begin

[Verse 2]
This ain't a number one record (uhh!)
This is practically assault with a deadly weapon (uhh!)
I made this just for Flex and
Mister Cee, I want niggas to feel threatened (uhh!)
Stop your bloodclot crying
The kid, the dog, everybody dying, no lying
You niggas' jeans too tight
You colors too bright, your voice too light (too far nigga) (uhh, uhh!)
I might wear black for a year straight (uhh!)
I might bring back Versace shades (uhh!)
This ain’t for Z100
Ye told me to kill y'all to keep it 1 hundred (uhh!)
This is for Hot 9-7
This shit for Clue, for Khaled we the best'n (uhh!)
Nigga this shit violent
This is death of auto-tune, moment of silence

[Chorus]
La-da da dah, hey-ayy-ayy, goodbyeeee... hol' up
Only nigga to re-write history without a pen
No I-D on the track let the story begin, begin, begin

[Verse 3]
Hold up, this shit need a verse from Jeezy (HEY!)
I might send this to the mixtape Weezy
Get somebody from BMF to talk on this
Get this to a Blood, let a Crip walk on it (uhh!)
Get 3 Thou' to style on this
I just don’t need nobody to smile on this (uhh!)
Y'all niggas singing too much
Get back to rap, you T-Paining too much (uhh, uhh!)
I’m a multi-millionaire
So how is it I’m still the hardest nigga here (uhh!)
I don’t be in the project hallway
Talking 'bout how I be in the project all day (uhh!)
That sound stupid to me
If you a gangsta, this is how you prove it to me (uhh, uhh!)
Nigga just get violent
This is death of auto-tune, moment of silence

[Outro]
La-da da dah, hey-ayy-ayy, goodbyeeee...
