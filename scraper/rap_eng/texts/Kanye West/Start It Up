[Intro: Kanye West]
What you gon do? It’s G.O.O.D. Music and G-Unit
Ugh, Banks, Loso

[Hook: Swizz Beatz]
Ladies and gentlemen
You know they mad cause cause cause I’m hood rich
You never ever ever seen a nigga good trick
You want a problem
Start it up (vroom vroom)
Start it up (vroom vroom)
Start it up (vroom vroom)
Wait a minute

[Verse 1: Lloyd Banks]
Big blue, hot and sandy shoe
Cotton candy coupe
Hard knock, orphan Annie loop
Off the stoop
Play with me, see what the swammy do
My canary shoe
High beams pointed right at you, peek-a-boo
Benji paper made me hater-proof
All your family dues
Menage a trois, purple haze and goose, got me loose
Kick my way in and now I got the juice, Gucci bubble goose
Thousand kicks couple hundred boots getting fucking loot
My top down, I’m flashing on em
I’m passing all them, pullover and hit the hazards on em
The ratchets on ‘em, pay my dues, now it’s back to ballin'
Your raps are boring dead men, I dip the casket for em
I’m back performing, I bag em
Break their back, don’t call em
Look down on em like Dikembe, Patrick, Mourning
Cash is pourin’
Stunt stormin, got these bitches soaked
Camera phones capture everything that pictures don't

[Hook: Swizz Beatz]

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
We keep these G’s in an alloy safe
And stash the weed in an Altoids case
They say good things come to those who wait
So I’mma be at least about a hour late
I’m so fresh bitch I should be arrested
New Cody Chesnutt with my nuts on your chest bitch
She said “hey ‘Ye,” I said “Yes, bitch”
"Damn I’m only asking you a question"
I met this MILF at the All-Star getting action
A cougar with more rings than Phil Jackson
Told her beauty is why God invented eyeballs
And her booty is why God invented my balls
I’m a rockstar, huh, start it up
Start it up, huh, start it up
So popular you should get a shot of us
Niggas don’t take shots at us that is only obvious
The first album I vomited, the second I colonic’d it
Ain't nobody fucking with me, I Platonic’d it
Bet I got some slippers on, bet niggas gon' honor it
These ain't even real clothes, homie I’m pajama rich
Banks told me homie go switch the style up
These bitches on me homie only to arouse us
Told her I ain't paying tonight I’m only browsing
She pulled her blouse up, said “It’s free,” I said, "wowzers"

[Bridge: Swizz Beatz]

[Ryan Leslie]
Let's get it started, get it started, get it started yeah yeah

[Verse 3: Fabolous]
Plenty hate, they be taking shots, never penetrate
Money generated, if we ain't in the house, renovate
Tryna eat, we ain't finna wait, where’s the dinner plates?
BMW, 10 to 8, Interstate 95
Passenger, baddest bitch in the states
Half Spanish, half Trinidad, complexion Henny straight
Y’all ain't got your business straight, track star, finna state
Time is money and I can’t afford to be a minute late
It’s time to make a movie let the haters watch
Diamonds spinning round the bezel that's tornado watch
My independent chick, I like my ladies Koch
She got an appetite for dick, I guess her plate's my crotch
Y'all soft as tater tot, little niggas try me not
Under the wings, fried rice at the Chinese spot
I hear ‘em talking it but ain't really living it
Opinions are like assholes so who gives a shit
