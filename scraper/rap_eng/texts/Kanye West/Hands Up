[Intro: Freddie Gibbs]
Yeah, fuck you nigga, you broke
Nigga, 'bout to rob me a nigga, put yo' hands up nigga

[Chorus: Freddie Gibbs]
Go and empty ya pockets (it's like that?)
Take ya money out yo' wallet (it's like that?)
Nigga give me all ya jewelry (it's like that?)
Hell yeah, talk slick and I'mma peel yo' cap
Go and empty ya pockets (it's like that?)
Take ya money out yo' wallet (it's like that?)
Nigga give me all ya jewelry (it's like that?)
Hell yeah, talk slick and I'mma peel yo' cap

[Verse 1: Freddie Gibbs]
Go put yo' hands up homie, bitch I'm broke
This a muthafuckin' stickup, it ain't no joke
If you don't wanna get a slug put up in yo' throat
Then I suggest you hop out that Davoucci coat
Bow, you ain't got nuttin' to worry about
Talk shit lil nigga, I'mma hurl ya out
I'm way outta control, my abandon is reckless
I might shoot you for yo' watch and yo' necklace
Yeah, you lookin' like a million bucks
So I'mma hit yo' ass up while you sit in the truck
Broad daylight nigga I ain't givin' a fuck
You got som' that I want, well you givin' it up
"Don't shoot me" man I ain't gon' shoot yo' ass
Put yo' face in the grass, nigga give me the cash
Don't be comin' around my neighborhood tryna floss
If you do you gon' pay the cost, like this

[Chorus: Freddie Gibbs]
Go and empty ya pockets (it's like that?)
Take ya money out yo' wallet (it's like that?)
Nigga give me all ya jewelry (it's like that?)
Hell yeah, talk slick and I'mma peel yo' cap
Go and empty ya pockets (it's like that?)
Take ya money out yo' wallet (it's like that?)
Nigga give me all ya jewelry (it's like that?)
Hell yeah, talk slick and I'mma peel yo' cap

[Verse 2: Freddie Gibbs]
Go on witcha punk ass, yeah keep frontin'
You say you roll deep, man that don't mean nuttin'
I saw you and ya lil clique poppin' collars
"Man, come on dog I know you got more than twenty dollars"
It be them same niggas that be
Be the ones gettin' robbed when they leave the club
Bein' broke hurts, so I'm tryna have the most merch
Bitches get it too, I hit ya for ya Coach purse
Yeah, that boy Freddie a mess
Don't tempt me, cause I'm the wrong nigga to test
And you got them 24's, sittin' up on ya Lex
Got me wantin' to put bullets all up in ya chest-aaa
Come on, I'm about to give ya the blues
If they fit, God dammit I'mma take the shoes
Why you cryin'? you ain't got no cash on you at all?
Let's hit the ATM homie we gon' make a withdrawal

[Chorus: Freddie Gibbs]
Go and empty ya pockets (it's like that?)
Take ya money out yo' wallet (it's like that?)
Nigga give me all ya jewelry (it's like that?)
Hell yeah, talk slick and I'mma peel yo' cap
Go and empty ya pockets (it's like that?)
Take ya money out yo' wallet (it's like that?)
Nigga give me all ya jewelry (it's like that?)
Hell yeah, talk slick and I'mma peel yo' cap

[Bridge]
This a stickup nigga, hands up
This a stickup, put ya hands up
This a stickup, nigga put ya hands up
Yeah, put yo' muthafuckin' hands up

[Verse 3: Freddie Gibbs]
Yo it's a rebel rap as far as I'd like to rob
Like Nelly, Baby, The Terror Squad
Come down dog, ain't nothin' personal dude
I just wanna hit you up cause you got some nice jewels
I really don't care what you got to say
If you act tough Freddie got som' to spray
If you see me in the streets, better pack ya heat
Cause I'mma jack you for ya cash, then jack ya beat

[Chorus: Freddie Gibbs]
Go and empty ya pockets (it's like that?)
Take ya money out yo' wallet (it's like that?)
Nigga give me all ya jewelry (it's like that?)
Hell yeah, talk slick and I'mma peel yo' cap
Go and empty ya pockets (it's like that?)
Take ya money out yo' wallet (it's like that?)
Nigga give me all ya jewelry (it's like that?)
Hell yeah, talk slick and I'mma peel yo' cap

[Outro: Freddie Gibbs]
Ugh, niggas gettin' stuck the fuck up
Put yo' hands up
This a stickup nigga, put yo' hands up
Ugh, put yo' muthafuckin' hands up
Ugh, when you see me in the streets put ya hands up
