[Chorus: Mr. Hudson]
And I feel like taking off
Let me be your supernova
Before you make the biggest mistake of your life
Just give me the chance to get it right
Get it right, get it right, get it right, get it right

[Verse 1: Mr. Hudson]
They got it all
They've got all the things I thought I wanted
But I can't afford, to fake anymore
To live this facade and smile as the warm champagne pours
Out on the lawn
We'll pretend we're having tonnes of fun in this world where we don't belong
Some bloke all alone
Is she thinking of me, did she forget what we once had?

[Chorus: Mr. Hudson]
And I feel like taking off
Let me be your supernova
Before you make the biggest mistake of your life
Just give me the chance to get it right, get it right
Get it right, get it right, get it right

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Oh, they got it all, you can see they got it all
They got the cars, the boat, and the beautiful house by the shore
And you know there's more
But I can't take another minute of it all
He wants his kids and the dog, he wants his breakfast in bed
He's got his trust fund saved, not a worry in his head
But it's not you, homie
I wanna break up the scene and see you running back to me

[Chorus: Kanye West]
'Cause I feel like taking off
Let me be your supernova
Before you make the biggest mistake of your life
Just give me a chance to get it right, get it right
Yeah I feel like taking off
Let me be your supernova tonight
Before you make the biggest mistake of your life
Just give me a chance to get it right, get it right

[Outro: Mr. Hudson]
Let me be
Let me
Let me be
Let me
Let me be
