Now what if Michael Jordan decided to stick to baseball and Jay-Z decided to stick to crack
Just Blaze decided to stick to engineering and Kanye never decided to rap?
What if a nigga from the Chi that was ill got a deal on the hottest rap label around?
But he wasn't talking about coke and birds, it was more like spoken word
'Cept the nigga's really putting it down
And he explained the story about how blacks came from glory
And what we need to do in the game
But kept in mind as long as [?] folks and niggas is dead broke
Some things they gone never change
But it ain't them [?] folks, it's the white folks that brought us over here with boats and tight ropes
But don't forget it was [?] niggas cause
The kings got rid of us, they selling a crackhead soap
Now follow me, sometimes I feel like dream is subtitles
Say things that mean things but hide them in club titles
So you'll hear something real but think that it's meaningless
Like, "Damn, I know I feel but I don't know what the meaning is!"
See that there's what make it so ingenious
And that's why Kweli never was lenient
Cause he know what I got, know I was making it hot
'Fore I was making a lot, 'fore I made it to the Roc
