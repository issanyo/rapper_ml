Oh you didn't think we can it again
Twista, Kanye West, from Po Pimping to Poppin Tags
From Chunkiest to Slow Jamz, oh baby
We can even make you a overnight celebrity
Know what I'm saying, come on
Why don't we, play something these hoes'd like
Drive whips, I know they like
Twista, you told her right
(I could make you a celebrity overnight)
Give you ice, like Kobe right
We sorta like Goldie right
The way, we mode em right
(I could make you a celebrity overnight)
Girl I see you, in them apple bottom jeans
Chinchilla on your back, I wanna know your name
Girl I'm Twista, I could blow your brains
Put you in a chameleon, 0-4 Range
Still sexy, when you smoke that flame
Jerk you like a chicken, when you throw that thang
She got me hotter than a oven, the way that she talk
Switching to freaky, so I'm loving the way that she walk
You looking good girl, you oughta be in pictures
Listen to me, I see your career going sky high
Taking you home to the crib, in the Chi
And everytime I see your thighs, I cry when I drive by
Watching you should be a thrill, got the fellas
Hustling trying to get, steady screaming my-my-my-my
Walk on the carpet, with the bells that flick in the dark
Kicking it on the couch, at 106 & Park
I can see your beauty, on the big screen
I can see me freaking you, with whip cream
I can see you on stage, at the awards
With a dress better than Jennifer's, and doing big things
Kick it with me, I can mold your life
You looking good girl, show you right
Dre told me, you the prototype
I can make you a celebrity overnight
Why don't we, play something these hoes'd like
Drive whips, I know they like
Twista, you told her right
(I could make you a celebrity overnight)
Give you ice, like Kobe right
We sorta like Goldie right
The way, we mode em right
(I could make you a celebrity overnight)
Why don't we, play something these hoes'd like

You want fame, you can take that path
Candlelights, when you take a bath
You got, such a sensational ass
I'ma get you Jimmy Chew, and Ma Baker bags
I can cop her, a 2000 and 3
Make her smile, when she sees Spre's
I can get you on cd's, and DVD's
Take you to BB's, and PCBG
I can get you in the places, to be into
The people to know or show you things, sticker than to
I wanna be your lover, undercover Don
And protect you from others, don't ever let a brother pimp you
If you want the style, you can rich your blood
Y'all take a look at her, she got such an astonishing body
I can see you in some Gucci, or Erika Vali
And I bet she gon put a hurt on em, hard in the party
And you know you kill em in the club, we go
You was born to be a po', how you gon sticking fo' do's
And I love you, cause you freaky with the dope clothes
Drop it to the flo', let it go when you roll slow
And I love it, when I hit it from the back
And you get on top of me, and have a brother going oh-oh
Girl I love, how you roll me right
I can make you, a celebrity overnight
Why don't we, play something these hoes'd like
Drive whips, I know they like
Twista, you told her right
(I could make you a celebrity overnight)
Give you ice, like Kobe right
We sorta like Goldie right
The way, we mode em right
(I could make you a celebrity overnight)
You see, see baby girl
You see how you make a brother break down
I just gotta ask you, what you need
What you need from me, oh you wanna be a star
Are you messing with the right one
I can take you there, I can make sure
You've got all the finest things
Let me be your manager
Come here girl, I could see you bored
Took you to the queen, that I see you for
Take you shopping on sprees, in stores
I'ma get you, to the MTV awards
We about, to do a show tonight
You looking good girl, show you right
Take you places, I know you like
I could make you a celebrity overnight
Come here girl, you could hang if you bored
We could do, plenty things plus more
I'm about to have you, change in the stores
I can even get you, to the Soul Train awards
We about, to do a show tonight
You looking good girl, show you right
Take you places, I know you like
I could make you a celebrity overnight
