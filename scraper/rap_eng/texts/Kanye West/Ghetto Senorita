Baby don't you know I need ya
I want you to be my ghetto señorita
And drive my two-seaters and hold my heaters
You look so good, you make me want to say (na, na na na)
.Baby don't you know I need ya
I want you to be my ghetto señorita
And drive my two-seaters and hold my heaters
Matter of fact, take this ring I promise I'll never leave you

[Verse 1: ?]
Christina the next Diva; Dope like reefer
Flow sicker than fever hold two heaters
Roll in a two seater chicks like me-a
Get off the meter, yeah I put my feet up
Nigga follow the leader or get off my ???
?????
Haters with my tape be like "Oh you a cheater"
Here we go again, real foes in my beeper
She getting married man, man told her he bout to leave her
I'm too hot to feed her, two shots of 'grita
Somebody tell her to ease up when ???
Six-Double O, shit gives you seizures
It don't pay to be ho, when we got our G's up
