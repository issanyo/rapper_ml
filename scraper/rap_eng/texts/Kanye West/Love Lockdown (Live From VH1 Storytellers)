[Verse 1]
I'm not loving you, way I wanted to
What I had to do, had to run from you
I'm in love with you, but the vibe is wrong
And that haunted me, all the way home
So you never know, never never know
Never know enough, 'til it's over love
'Til we lose control, system overload
Screaming, "No, no, no, n-nooo!"
I'm not loving you, way I wanted to
See I wanna move, but can't escape from you
So I keep it low, keep a secret code
So everybody else don't have to know

[Hook]
So keep your love lockdown - your love lockdown
Keeping your love lockdown - your love lockdown
You keep your love lockdown - your love lockdown
You keep your love lockdown - you lose

[Verse 2]
I'm not loving you, way I wanted to
I can't keep my cool, so I keep it true
I got something to lose, so I gotta move
I can't keep my-self, and still keep you too
So I keep in mind, when I'm on my own
Somewhere far from home, in the danger zone
How many times did I tell you 'fore it finally got through?
You lose, you lose
I'm not loving you, way I wanted to
See I had to go, see I had to move
No more wasting time, we can't wait for life
We're just racing time, where's the finish line?

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
I'm not loving you, way I wanted to
I bet no one knew, I got no one new
Know I said I'm through, but got love for you
But I'm not loving you, way I wanted to
Gotta keep it going, keep the loving going
Keep it on the roll, only God knows
If I be with you, baby I'm confused
You choose, you choose
I'm not loving you, way I wanted to
Where I’m bout to go, I don't need you
I've been down this road, too many times before
I'm not loving you, way I wanted to

[Hook]

So keep your love locked down, so keep your love lockdown
So keep your love locked down, so keep your love lockdown

Is anybody in the house right now in love right now?
In love right now, well keep your love lockdown
If anybody in the house right now is in love right now
Try your best to keep your love lockdown
Keep your love lockdown
Keep it on

Is it better to have loved and lost, than to never have loved at all?

This brings us to the end of my VH1 Storyteller
Thank you for
Being my shrink today and the stage as my couch
Thank you for allowing me to get some things off my chest and out of my mind
The ghosts out of my head so they will not haunt me at night
And just for this moment as I hear clap and hear you scream, just for this moment
I feel alright

My pain shall be your pleasure, my torment and tragedy

I'm not loving you, way I wanted to
See I had to go, see I had to move
No more wasting time, you can't wait for life
We're just racing time, where's the finish line?
Where’s the finish line?
Are we at the finish line?
Running for the finish line
Running for the finish line
Are we at the finish line?
Are we at the finish line?
Are we at the finish line?
Are we at the finish line?
You run for the finish line
You run for the finish line
I’m not ready to fi-finish life
But I’m on the finish line
So I run from the finish line
I run from the finish line
‘Cause I’m not ready to finish life
I gotta run from the finish life

So keep your love lockdown, so keep your love
You keep your love
We’re low…

Not loving you, way I wanted to
What I had to do, had to run from you
I'm in love with you, but the vibe is wrong
And that haunted me, all the way home
So you never know, never never know
Never know enough, 'til it's over love
'Til we lose control, system overload
Screaming, "No, no, no, no, no, noo
I'm not loving you, way I wanted to
What I had to do, had to run from you
So I keep it low, keep a secret cold
So everybody else don’t have to know

So keep your love lockdown
You keep your love lockdown [3x]

So keep your love lockdown [3x]
You keep your love lockdown and you lose

Is anybody in the house right now that’s in love right now?
You gotta keep your love locked down, you gotta keep your love
Promise me, promise me, promise me, promise me
Please, please, promise me
Please, promise me, please
That you will keep your love lockdown
Just try to keep your love lockdown

You don’t want to make the music
I’m forced to make right now
I know it sounds good and all
But I would rather have my love lockdown
That number one hit don’t mean shit
If it’s nobody to celebrate with
To celebrate with, to levitate with

You gotta keep your love lockdown, your love lockdown
Your love lockdown, your love lockdown
Now keep your love lockdown, your love lockdown
You lose
