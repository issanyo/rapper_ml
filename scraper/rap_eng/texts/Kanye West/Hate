[Phonte]
Yeah, what up? It's Phonte, Phontigga
I gotta take time to address 'em
Kanye, I know you understand where I'm comin from baby
Uh, all you non-believing motherfuckers - this is for y'all

[Hook: Phonte]
They got hate for that, they ain't gon' pay for that
They gon' download it nigga, they can't wait for that
But I don't care if our shit flop
It's dope beats, dope rhymes, nigga that's Hip Hop
They got hate for that, they ain't gon' pay for that
To see me fall off my nigga, they can't wait for that
But I'mma do what I feel like
Three albums in the game muh'fucker, we still tight

[Phonte]
Yo, let me get into it
Stop all the fame and applause
And name callin at them famous award shows
Nigga that's just brainless and Lord knows
What would happen if I wasn't rappin for them lost souls
Who feel that Hip Hop's at the crossroads
And miss that type of shit that they can feel in they torsos
I wish this shit was easy, oh not so
Even the road less travelled is littered with potholes
And booby traps, 'Te is more than hot flows and booty raps
But, niggas who missed their shot can't seem to handle that
So, they hate on us like Soviets
But we keep them niggas in check like Wachovia
And it ain't over yet
Cause hater niggas marry hater bitches and y'all know the rest
Yes... stop your crying baby

[Hook: Phonte]
They got hate for that, they ain't gon' pay for that
They gon' download it nigga, they can't wait for that
But I don't care if our shit flop
It's dope beats, dope rhymes, nigga that's Hip Hop
They got hate for that, they ain't gon' pay for that
To see me fall off my nigga, they can't wait for that
But I'mma do what I feel like
Three albums in the game muh'fucker, we still tight

[Phonte]
You know the feelin when your hard workin
Hustlin pays off (pays off), pays off (pays off)
And you can finally get all your credit cards paid off (paid off), paid off
Nigga they got hate for that, lately I've been takin my time
Tryna sit back and chill, get away from the grind
For the sake of my rhymes, and the sake of my flows
Got your girl in here naked steady touchin her toes
Like them porno hoes, what would you do for a threesome?
I mean a Halle Berry, Sanaa Lathan and Free-some
Oooh they have love for that
They might show up raw dog with no glove for that
'Te, your check'll be there on Monday
Three months later, your check'll be there on Monday
That shit ain't funny, I ain't no dummy
Fuckin with my money, do I need to call my niggas Big Dho or Dunny?
I know y'all hatin and I hope y'all hear this
I don't give a goddamn, y'all can just keep starin
Yeah, uh

[Hook: Phonte]
They got hate for that, they ain't gon' pay for that
So much hate I know they probably hate this track
But I don't care if our shit flop
It's dope beats, dope rhymes, nigga that's Hip Hop
They got hate for that, they can't wait for that
Found this loop like "Damn, 'Ye got payed for that"
I don't give a damn if our shit flop
It's dope beats, dope rhymes, nigga that's Hip Hop
