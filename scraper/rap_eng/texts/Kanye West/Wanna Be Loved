[Intro]
Yeah, you wanna be loved, yeah
Oh, come on, come on, come on, come on
You wanna be loved, yeah
Listen

[Verse 1]
Everywhere I go, everywhere I’ll be
I see lonely hearts and falling leaves
Where do those hearts go, do they find their match
Or do they drift away, it’s time to bring them back

[Hook 1]
They wanna be loved, they wanna be loved
Come on, it’s simple enough
They wanna be loved, yeah

They wanna be loved, they wanna be loved
A little piece to the heart
They wanna be loved

[Verse 2]
But everybody knows it don’t always last
But if I can’t have it for long, then I want it fast
Better love for now, then for never old
So baby, if you’re down, give me a call!

[Hook 2]
I wanna be loved, I wanna be loved
Come on, it’s simple enough
I wanna be loved, yeah
Alright, c'mon

I wanna be loved, I wanna be loved
A little piece to the heart
I wanna be loved
Yeah

[Bridge]
La la la la
Yeah, don’t you wanna be loved
Yeah, sing for love, yeah!
Yeah, don’t you wanna be loved?


[Hook 3]
You wanna be loved, you wanna be loved
Come on, it’s simple enough
You wanna be loved, yeah
Alright

You wanna be loved, you wanna be loved
A little piece to the heart
You wanna be loved, oh yeah!
