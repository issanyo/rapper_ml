[Intro: Kanye West]
Yo
I go by the name of Kan the louis Vuitton Don
I'm chillin with my homegirl Myleka, and she wanted to let you know something real quick

[Hook: Myleka]
Baby, don’t you wanna play with me
Mama taste like candy, come give me a kiss
All over my sexy body, I work it like a gypsy
You know you want this

[Verse 1: Myleka]
I like a man who can stimulate my mind
Wet lips that whisper dirty things sometimes
I take it slow, don’t wanna rush but you got me so hot and curious
This is my little secret confession, just have one question

[Hook: Myleka]
Baby, don’t you wanna play with me
Mama taste like candy, come give me a kiss
All over my sexy body, I work it like a gypsy
You know you want this
Baby, don’t you wanna play with me
Mama taste like candy, come give me a kiss
All over my sexy body, I work it like a gypsy
You know you want this

[Verse 2: Myleka]
I can feel your eyes undressing me, you’re next to me
Imagining you sexing me
Don’t tell me no lies
If I give it to you will everything be alright?
What I got is so sweet
Tell me what you gonna do
So I can give you what you need

[Hook: Myleka]
Baby, don’t you wanna play with me
Mama taste like candy, come give me a kiss
All over my sexy body, I work it like a gypsy
You know you want this
Baby, don’t you wanna play with me
Mama taste like candy, come give me a kiss
All over my sexy body, I work it like a gypsy
You know you want this

[Verse 3: Kanye West]
If you got any little freak in you then I’mma find it
These niggas read the pimp manual but I designed it
I see you bouncing it up and down and ooh I like it
I know you gonna be mine, because ooh I’m psychic
You said you taste like candy do, right?
Why don’t you go ahead, let me get two bites
How about this: bust out the whip cream
Let’s have a real freaky food fight
Oh no, it’s getting too tight
So I never ever say I’m ever too tight
If I come in the middle tonight then Myleka I’mma do whatever you like

[Hook: Myleka]
Baby, don’t you wanna play with me
Mama taste like candy, come give me a kiss
All over my sexy body, I work it like a gypsy
You know you want this
Baby, don’t you wanna play with me
Mama taste like candy, come give me a kiss
All over my sexy body, I work it like a gypsy
You know you want this
Baby, don’t you wanna play with me
Mama taste like candy, come give me a kiss
All over my sexy body, I work it like a gypsy
You know you want this

[Outro: Myleka]
Kiss me from head to toe
Now do it in slow-mo
You’ve got me in the zone
Never ever gonna let you go
Kiss me from head to toe
Now do it in slow-mo
You’ve got me in the zone
Never ever gonna let you go
All over my body
I taste like candy
