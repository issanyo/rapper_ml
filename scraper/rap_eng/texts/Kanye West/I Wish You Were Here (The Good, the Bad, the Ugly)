[Intro: Kanye West (& Al Green)]
This is actually an official mixtape
It's really me
And I've
(Got good music on my radio)
I got DJ A-Trak on the cut!
(I've got good music on my radio)
I got [Don C Lane?] on the cut
(I've got good music on my radio)
It's GOOD Music!

[Verse 1: Al Green (& Kanye West)]
Birds singin', tryin' to make things right
(Right now, I just wanna take y'all back
Right when I hear this music, it brings me back to a place and time
It brings back a lotta memories
So hopefully, when y'all hear this tape)
Lookin' out my window
(It'll bring back a lotta memories for y'all)
Sun shinin' bright
(Yeah)
Birds singin', tryin' to make things right
I've got good music on my radio
How did your love songs play from those doors?
I don't want no one to come in to catch me sigh
But every since you left, said goodbye

[Refrain: Al Green]
I wish you were here with me
I wish you were here with me

[Verse 2: Al Green]
Somethin' 'bout your kiss, gloom all around me
Seem like love is never gonna find me
I keep on looking for a, a brighter day
When all I see is time slipping away
I've got to stop and get myself together
All I can see is stormy weather

[Refrain: Al Green]
I wish you were here with me
I wish you were here with me
