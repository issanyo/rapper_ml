[Rick James]
Yeah, Kanye, Bump J, and I'm Rick James bitch
Coming at you live

[Hook: Rick James & Bump J]
You wanna lock me down, cuff me up
Since we hooked up, baby I'm on the run
(I'm on the run that's the dope)
And I can't stop now
I'm driving at top speed now, top is down
You hear the cops shout cause baby I'm on the run
And I can't stop now

[Verse 1: Bump J]
I'd be a fool to stop now, I'm on a roll
If I ain't on these blocks hustlin' I'm on and off the road
I'd rather be in the seat of the 645 with two shotguns
Or in a suite taking off your clothes
And yes, the connection and sex is crazy
But you just want to be like Jodeci, forever my lady
I don't think we on the same page see
I just wanna kick it, hit it, and you tryna have my baby
Lock me down while I'm young, but I'm livin' my life
Shawty I can't stop now, I'm on the run
This is not the end, we can still be friends
Just as long as you understand that you can't

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Don't think that we a couple cause I'm with you tonight
I gotta hit the streets, I gotta move this white
And when it comes to spoilin' you, I'ma do you right
You tryna put the cuffs on me like the blue and whites
Do what I can for ya, shoes on that brand new Lamb for ya
Carats on ya neck and hands for ya, ya man love ya
He got plans for ya, you know now
Ya moving too fast, slow down
We can do it up, private jet around the land
Go tan on the yacht, dock by the sand
I'll put it all in your hands
Just as long as you understand that you can't

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
I got this girl in L.A, she's so Hollywood
Gotta whole lot of paper cause her father good
Take me shoppin' 'round town, and she want Bump J to settle down
And for the [?], I probably should
I'm just jokin', I told her when I'm in town I'll call her
I don't see her much, she done found herself a baller
Good for ya, I was no good for ya
You deserve somebody like that, I'm way too hood for ya
And every other girl that Bump might've ran
They got a mixed signal, thinkin' I'ma be they man
It ain't over, I probably am
Just as long as you understand that you can't
