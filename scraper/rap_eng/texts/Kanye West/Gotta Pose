[Intro]
Kanye to The, yeah, you heard the name
Checks plus raps finna murder the game, uh
Can y'all get it? Fuck y'all
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh

[Verse 1]
All these niggas believe
They breathe the same air that I breathe and bleed like I bleed
Only difference though, I fuck better hoes
Iceberg clothes, I got to pose
Every whip with the studio in a hospital
This nigga flow is very sick
Plus very rich hoes, very thick chain, very thick
Feel like I could fuck every bitch
Twenties at the bottom, carry the six
If I cop back, then shot him, I buried him six
You can't hate this nigga with the platinum braces
I rather need new teeth than a whole facelift
Plus your taste is rather tasteless
Test my aim and watch me ace this
You wack rap cats need a replacement
So I hit the basement, took it back to basics
Reach down to my Timbs, grab my laces
Got loops on niggas, y'all want a tight noose on niggas
If I ain't holler at you for (?), niggas
What the fuck I got to do, another truth for niggas?
See, it don't really matter what y'all prove to niggas
Y'all ain't satisfied 'til we shoot some niggas
So if somebody got to die, tell me who want it
That Chi-Town, South Side bullshit, we on it

[Hook]
Who you know twenty-five that rolls?
Fifteen carats on top of the white gold
Pull up in the drop, then froze
I got to pose
Go on 'head, baby, you could pose
Gettin' naked at Go-Getter shows
Then she drop, then froze
I got to pose

[Verse 2]
Man, bitch, I ain't finished with your ass
Heavy all night, spendin' cash at the ball
At the show and before we got back
At the gas station buyin' your ass snacks
At the liquor store buyin' act right juice
So when we get bid-ad, you know how to hit that
Next time, bring some friends for me to get at
But no fat hoes, you expect me to hit that?
Molly set me up like, "K got scratched"
Run up in the crib mad, stuck with that
Y'all niggas talk that, but y'all don't really lit that
So I had to hit them with the flat out, get your ass out
You tuned in with the boss of the bosses
NFL, no fuckin' losses
Chain flossless, fuck with it cost us
We go broke, we take y'all for hostage

[Hook]
Who you know twenty-five that rolls?
Fifteen carats on top of the white gold
Pull up in the drop, then froze
I got to pose
Go on 'head, baby, you could pose
Gettin' naked at Go-Getter shows
Then she drop and froze
I got to pose

[Verse 3]
You see me rollin', smokin', coastin', boastin'
Plus a little gone off the potion
Oh, and known for flossin' a little too often
Might end up in a coffin
I'm floatin' cause I don't smoke like that
Y'all niggas want to plot, we don't joke like that
Faggot-ass niggas get approached like that
Matter of fact, murder gettin' wrote like that
I'm finna take these niggas back to the streets
Back to hoppin' out the 'Lac with the heat
Back to the fifty, posin' with some bitches
In front of that airbrushed 2Pac picture

[Hook]
Who you know twenty-five that rolls?
Fifteen carats on top of the white gold
Pull up in the drop, then froze
I got to pose
Go on 'head, baby, you could pose
Gettin' naked at Go-Getter shows
And then she drop and froze
