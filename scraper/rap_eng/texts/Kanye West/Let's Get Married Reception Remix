Just gots me a crib and a new car too
I got the ring, but I gotta have you babe
C'mon let's get married babe
C'mon let's get married
Let's have some kids with a dog with a house
A lil white fence, just like this, babe
C'mon let's get married babe
Let's get married

[Jagged Edge]
Meet me at the alter
In your white dress (your white dress)
You won't ever need another man
You never, ever want from another thing, no
I've been feeling you
I must confess (must confess)
Ain't nobody gonna break this thang up
I ain't going nowhere, no
Cuz when I think about you and think about me
Plain to see that we might as well do it (do it)

Babe, how bout ten (how bout ten)
Is it good enough for you to brag on
When you show your friends (show your friends)
I just want to be with you
Girl there ain't I think I won't do
Want you to be the one to say I do
We can start a family
Cuz when I think about you and think about me
Plain to see that we might as well do it (do it)

With my tuxedo
He asked me do you take this
Woman to hold and keep the safest
Plus to lace her, floss wit paper
Crib and a car, man you know tha basics
Diamonds your best friend
That makes sense because
You a princess and you deserve the princess cuts
But as long as you gots ya defenses up
You can never get the love that was meant for ya
Shoot, you know that I "use to come through on da club tip"
Real thugs don't never fall in love
Always on the g-o, for the d-o
Man I had to take t-o, smits some cutie
Since my money gettin' right these days
I wanna give you more ice than the ice capades
I gots the church, the ring
There's something I'm forgetting
Oh, we gotta have J.E. sing at the wedding
