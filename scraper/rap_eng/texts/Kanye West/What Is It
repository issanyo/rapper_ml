I’ve been watchin’ you from over here on the other side of the club lookin’ at’chu all through that
Smoke
What do you drank, -drank
Little Patron, a little Grey Goose, a little Hennessey
But when I see you, all my girls like “What do you—
“Thank?”
“How do you feel,-feel?”
Butterflies running all up and down my chest but he’s so hot to death and I’m Sophia Fresh and that’s
Real

Get up and walk to a th-iz-ug and act like I'm innocent and cute?
Nah, I’mma step like

Double L while the A-C blows so
Cule
How does it ride –ride?
24s on the back wit a fifth 24 on the back
Twenty hits on a lac truck back up to a
Glide
Super high from the ground
I feel like I’m an alien in a UFO
Somebody better beam me up back on down
What else am I suppose to do?
Get up an’ walk to a th-iz-ug and act like im innocent and cute?
Haha, I’mma step like…

[Verse 3: Kanye West]
Uh, I don’t need no little ass
I need a ghetto ass
Girl wit a little car that can make it cross town wit just a little gas
I know when we first met
You was a little gassed
But you wanna keep your swag
So you was holdin’ back
Yo’ little brotha luv me
He say “Yeezy got some fresh clothes”
Yo’ grandmother luv me ‘cause I always dress in dress clothes
I can switch yo’ dress code
Change your life like “Presto”
I am like that aston martin engine, you just press “Go”
Why –why you ac’in’ like you ain’t impressed for?
Oh, see, why you listen to the press, though?
I-I-ain’t fitta ‘splain my life up on no Larry King ‘cause when I show her that thing, she say
“That explains everything”
“Everything”
“That just changed everything”
Yeezy on her name ring
Yeezy with her chain bling
Yea I throw Barack up, but
Baby, you get my vote
Love a ghetto girl
With more ass than the models
(See-see-see I did the-the skrewed up shit myself)
(I didn’t put no effect, no – you know)
