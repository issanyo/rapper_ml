[Verse 1]
Why would she make calls out the blue?
Now I'm awake, sleepless in June

[Chorus]
Hey hey hey hey
Don't say you will
Hey hey hey hey
Don't say you will, unless you will

[Verse 2]
Mrs. So Fly crash-lands in my room
Can't waste no time, she might leave soon

[Chorus]
Hey hey hey hey
Don't say you will, you will
Hey hey hey hey
Don't say you will, you will, one day you will

[Verse 3]
When I grab your neck, I touch your soul
Take off your cool then lose control

[Chorus]
Hey hey hey hey
Don't say you will, unless you will
Say aye aye aye
Don't say you will, I pray you will, I pray you will

[Verse 4]
I wish this song would really come true
I admit I still fantasize about you, about you

[Chorus]
Hey hey hey hey
Don't say you will, you will, you will
Hey hey hey hey
Don’t say you will, unless you will, I pray you will

[Instrumental Break]

[Extended Chorus]
Hey hey hey hey
Don't say you will, you will, you will
Hey hey hey hey
Don’t say you will
Hey hey hey hey…
Don't say you will
Hey hey hey hey
Hey hey hey hey
Hey hey hey hey
Hey hey hey hey
Don’t, don’t, don’t, don’t say

[Outro/Monologue]
Keep the music on

This is a
This song was written for
A special moment in my life
Someone so special, that I love forever

And you know like, when you break up with somebody
And you have those times where you wanna see ‘em again
And you’re trying to make plans on a Friday night, in New York City
And you clear your whole schedule for this person, even though you’re not together no more

‘Cause there’s nothing better than, someone you know and love
Even if you know you can’t love them no more
You can’t love them no more

Today, take presidents over anybody you dating or going out with or just hooking up with
And she knows who she is
To have someone so special in your life, that you’re inspired by them
I ask myself, as I date
What am I looking for?
The requirement of this position is inspirement
The requirement is inspirement
And I am higher in
But also firing
Also firing, firing

I wanted to express that story better, it didn’t come out as good as I wanted
Wasn’t as poignant as I wanted to make it for my favorite story and for my ode to my loves
