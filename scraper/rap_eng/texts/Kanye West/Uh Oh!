[Intro: Kanye West]
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Man, I know what type of guy you is
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Money, that's my girl! Lookin', you dig?
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
You know what man, I'm used to y'all
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Fuck you! Shit you heard that?

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
I hated on y'all niggas before
But not on no ho shit, I just wanted your hoes
And I ain't gon' lie, I'll lie to a bitch
Quick as hell, you sick as hell, that bitch thick as hell
I let her get my pager, she let me get the cell
Picked her up, did her well, dropped her off, get my mail
Y'all know, she wanna page me all day
Wanna ride the dick like yippee Kanye
I figured though, long as she don't let a nigga know
Game tight, like ankles on Girbauds
And you know go getters be on these hoes
Genuwine, they wanna ride my pony though
Cause their niggas all lame, need to give back their name
Or return their jersey and retire from the game
Why this nigga wanna hate me mane?
Make me take it off safety mane, and make me aim
.380s make it hotter, 87 street
Eight deep in a Cadillac Escalada
That I just leased out with my pants creased out
When I pull the piece out, niggas like peace out

[Hook: Kanye West]
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Why these niggas wanna hate me mane?
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Why these niggas wanna hate me mane?
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Gotta take it off safety mane
No, no, no, no, no
No I can't let 'em take me mane

[Verse 2: Timmy G]
They don't wanna see a nigga got it made, rappin' on stage
They'd rather see me packin' a gauge, and actin' my age
They say to get your eyes swole, let 'em know how I roll
Never seen six niggas jump out one Oldsmobile
Nah eight, bumpin' Ice Cube
I push rhymes like weight, with nothin' to lose
Still runnin' from the feds in my And 1 shoes
I went from hoppin' fences to jumpin' out of Benzes
Whippin' 4 doors with the mo mos
The gate go up and down like yo-yos
Don't try to play me out 'fore these shots spray you out
Could really give y'all niggas somethin' to hate about

[Hook: Kanye West]
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Why these niggas wanna hate me mane?
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Why these niggas wanna hate me mane?
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Gotta take it off safety mane
No, no, no, no, no
No I can't let 'em take me mane

[Verse 3: GLC]
It's that go-getter life, bogus life, all I know
Stood on the block for 20 minutes, nigga got off all my blow
Silver rockin' niggas try to hate my gold
Bouncer ass niggas wanna hate my swole
Fiends run around, tryna hate my blow
I found a hater broke in my crib and I'ma break his nose
This ho nigga tried to get me, but he didn't so he slippin'
When I see him, that's when I get him
Now his people say he missin'
I tied him up inside of my truck
Would've been dead if I didn't duck
Could've been shot, I could've been bust
But I dropped, didn't get touched
Just my luck that I had this pump
Nigga didn't know that I had this pump
Came at the nigga like "Uh huh"
What, nigga? Up them funds
Smokers just wanna have fun, bustin' a gun
Kept my Ones laced up when them people chased us
Plus my work in the toilet down in the basement
And I stay a step ahead of all of you haters

[Hook: Kanye West]
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Why these niggas wanna hate me mane?
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Why these niggas wanna hate me mane?
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Gotta take it off safety mane
No, no, no, no, no
No I can't let 'em take me mane
