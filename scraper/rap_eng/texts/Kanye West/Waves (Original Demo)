[Intro]
I want to make some real love, ya dadada
That was kinda raw
Yo ma that melody that shine
(turn it up)

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Step up in this bitch like (turn it up!)
I'm the one your bitch like
Mack you down like a quick dyke
Tell your friends they can hitchhike
And your tan looking just right
She grabbing on my like
She want to see if it'll fit right

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Waves don't die
Let me crash here for the moment
I don't need to own it
No lie
Waves don't die, baby
Let me crash here for a moment
Baby I don't, I don't need to own you
No lie, no lie, no lie
You set this night on fire
Still gon' be here in the morning no lie

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Step up in this bitch like (turn it up!)
I'm the one your bitch like
Mack you down like a quick dyke
Make your man take a hitchhike
He don't understand how you hit right
Try it on if it fit right
Now its on [?]

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Waves don't die
Let me crash here for the moment
I don't need to own it
No lie
Waves don't die, baby
Let me crash here for a moment
Baby I don't, I don't need to own you
No lie

[Outro]
Check me
