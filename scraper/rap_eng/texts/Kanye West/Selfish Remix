I'm calling
Out to
All my
Y'all my ladies, and I can't
Let you, be with, no one, but me, baby

Gotta admit to this little addiction
To the ladies and they just can't fix him
Conversation and the drinks start mixin'
And I'm a champ like the Detroit Pistons

I tried to contain myself
But I can't restrain myself
I can only blame myself
Maybe I need to get some help

Now what can I do?
It's so hard to choose
This one's for you
Yeah all of you

I'm calling
Out to
All my
Y'all my ladies, and I can't
Let you, be with, no one, but me, baby

My starting five how do I pick them?
I came up with this rating system
I think about how it feels when I kiss them
And when I'm gone do I truly miss them?
Well baby, you made the team
Now go cook my favorite things
Greens and some chicken wings
Tastes so good that you make me wanna sing

So what can I do?
It's so hard to choose
This one's for you
Yeah all of you

I'm calling
Out to
All my
Y'all my ladies, and I can't
Let you, be with, no one, but me, baby

I'm calling
Out to
All my
Y'all my ladies, and I can't
Let you, be with, no one, but me, baby
