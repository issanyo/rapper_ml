[Intro: Kanye West]
I know what it's like to feel down little girl
I hope someone lifts you up like the big guy who lifted me up
I'm talkin about the big guy right here: Cleveland Brown

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Not long ago I was lower than Lohan
No plan, a lost man, raisin' my little girl in a Cadillac Brougham
My quest success, but my life was a mess
Poor Kenny West, no zest, anti-depressed
Not dressed to impress
Matter fact more stressed
Than John Mayer waiting on his AIDS test
Then I met a man who taught me how to live large
Took me out of my car
Now I'm in his garage
Turns out all I needed was some inspiration
Like Mr. Miagi but a lot less Asian
My game was timid now my flow much bolder
Got a chubby brown angel on my shoulder, sayin'

[Hook: Keke Palmer, Kanye West, Mike Henry]
You know, it don't matter what you do
Cause I'll always be there for you
Be-Cleve in yourself, grow a mustache
Be-Cleve in yourself, slap your wife's ass
Be-Cleve in yourself, never smoke grass
Be-Cleve in yourself, really pass gas
Be-Cleve in yourself, Goochland! Goodnight!
