Christmas in Harlem
Right after autumn falls
Soakin’ it all in
Then we go hit the mall
Even though we ain’t ballin’
Feels like we bought it all
The mistletoe’s right here
Come give a kiss to Santa Claus

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Merry Christmas to all, and all a good night
Huh, now we all livin’ the good life
Yeah, though it’s forty below the wind chill
And we wipin’ snow up off the windshield
It’s still, wonderful night to be alive, baby
And I’m, so happy I’m with my baby
And we a li’l late wit’ the Christmas gifts
Rushin’ for the mall, don’t trip, you know I drive crazy
The streets lit up, it feel like Christmas officially
Told her that “You the star at the top of my Christmas tree”
My only question is, “Where my presents?”
She said, “Shhh,” she got a gift for me that ain’t for the kids to see
Well, I like the way you think, mami
Now pour some more eggnog in you drink, mami
Got a surprise for you that ain’t on your Christmas list-es
Gave her the hot chocolate, she said “It’s D-ricious”

[Verse 2: Cyhi the Prince]
First, I wanted to say Merry Christmas to y’all
For Santa Claus, so bake a turkey, burn a few logs
I be there soon, on my sled, me and Rudolph
Thugs think I’m a Blood ’cause I won’t take this red suit off
Ha, I swear I got the freshest wardrobe
I let my beard grow ’cause it’s cold in the North Pole
Her voice slow ’cause “I always got a sore throat”
Okay, stop it, no more jokes
You never see me ’cause I shop when the stores close
And my sleigh go faster than the Porsche go
Ha, I got nine reindeers
That’s Dancer, that’s Prancer on the fourth flo’
That’s Comet, that’s Cupid, that’s Vixen
That’s Donner, that’s Dasher, that’s Blitzen
Happy Kwanzaa, and for the ones that aren’t Christian
Everybody gets gifts as long as I’m livin’
So look forward to havin’

[Hook: Teyana Taylor]

[Verse 3: Teyana Taylor]
All the flashin’ lights up on a tree
The house lit up ni-ice
Wit’ your family’s where you wanna be
Here on Christmas night
When you wake up and you see the gifts
Don’t that make you feel go-ood?
So since we all snowed in in Harlem
Let’s have Christmas in the hoo-hood

[Bridge: Teyana Taylor]
All of the flashin’ light
Yeah, when they shine so bright
Always for you and me
Baby, you’re Christmas Eve
If you like what you see me
Won’t you come sit on my knee?
Tell me everything that you want
‘Cause, baby, I’m your Santa Claus

[Hook: Teyana Taylor]

[Verse 4: Kanye West]
I peeped it, you know what?
Need some reindeer for this one
I wanna hear sleigh bells on this one
Got a new suit on this one
The newborn look too cute for this one
Yeah, the new winter coat for this one
Yeah, gotta let it snow on this one
Huh, all the Christmas cheer for this one
The whole family up in here on this one
Yeah
