[Intro]
Bom bom bom bom bom

[Hook]
Last night I saw you in my dreams
Now I can't wait to go to sleep
Last night I saw you in my dreams
Now I can't wait to go to sleep

My mama, mama, mama
I wanna scream so loud for you, cause I'm so proud of you
And let me tell you what I'm about to do
I know I act a fool but, I promise you I'm goin back to school
And I appreciate what you allowed for me and I

[Verse 1]
I was three years old, when you and I moved to the Chi
Late December, harsh winter gave me a cold
You fixed me up something that was good for my soul
Famous homemade chicken soup, can I have another bowl?
You work late nights just to keep on the lights
Mommy got me training wheels so I could keep on my bike
And you would give anything in this world
Michael Jackson leather and a glove, but didn't give me no curl
And you never put no man over me
And I love you for that mommy can't you see?
Seven years old, caught you with tears in your eyes
Cuz somebody cheatin, telling you lies, then I started to cry
As we knelt on the kitchen floor
I said mommy I'mma love you till you don't hurt no more
And when I'm older, you ain't gotta work no more
And I'mma get you that mansion that we couldn't afford
See you're, unbreakable, unmistakable
Highly capable, lady that's makin loot
A living legend too, just look at what heaven do
Send us an angel, and I thank you Mama

I wanna scream so loud for you, cause I'm so proud of you
And let me tell you what I'm about to do
Mama, you know I love you so, and I'll never let you go
And I wrote this song just so you know that when you go

[Hook]
Last night I saw you in my dreams
Now I can't wait to go to sleep
Last night I saw you in my dreams
Now I can't wait to go to sleep

My mama, mama, mama
I wanna scream so loud for you, cause I'm so proud of you
And let me tell you what I'm about to do
I know I act a fool but, I promise you I'm goin back to school
And I appreciate what you allowed for me and I

[Outro]
And this life is all a dream
And my real life starts when I go to sleep
My mama, mama, mama
