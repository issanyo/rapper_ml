[Hook]
I go to Jacob with 25 thou, you go with 25 hundred, wow
I got 11 plaques on my wall right now
You got your first gold single damn nigga, wow

[Verse 1]
H to the Izzo did 3 thou spins in a week
You get a thou in a month, wow
Y'all niggas want credit but y'all need to slow down
Kanye to the killin' y'all from Chi-town, how your wife gon say
She never sold drugs a day in her life, but she still wanna pump the Ye
And y'all mad 'cause y'all not knowin, 'cause these canaries so yellow
When y'all pull up whether to stop or keep goin
I got G’s, rock Rock n Roll tees wit no sleeves
Tats showin', tucked in strap showin'
How he get seven TVs in that ‘lac ‘lac
3 in the front, 2 in the back, 2 in that back, back
While you in that hatchback
And tryin to sell work and don’t get shit from them packs back
And try to rap, the studios won't give you ya daps back
And try to get publishin', all you get in your ass capped
And that’s that

[Hook]
I go to Jacob with 25 thou, you go with 25 hundred, wow
I got 11 plaques on my wall right now
You got your first gold single damn nigga, wow

[Verse 2]
Magazines call me a rock star, bitches call me cock star
Billboard pop star, neighborhood block star
Chi-town go-getting pimps, we mob-stars
Gingerbread man even says “You’re a monster”
Remember that, uh-huh, that’s that Shrek shit
Remember back in ’92 niggas used to catch wreck shit
Remember that track I tracked for you bout 3 months ago?
Uh huh that’s the one, now cut my check bitch
And I ain't feeling that Lexus - more that CLK
See me like "Damn! A CL-K!?”
Yeah that’s how we eating and, keep us looking peace and then
I ain't know he rap as good as he do beats, and then

[Hook]
I go to Jacob with 25 thou, you go with 25 hundred, wow

You got your first gold single damn nigga, wow

[Outro]
H to the Izzo did 3 thou spins in a week
You get a thou in a month, wow
Y'all niggas want credit but y'all need to slow down
Kanye to the killin' y'all from Chi-town
