[Verse 1] Famous Kels
She's my queen I'm her king
Ain't no fucking with me
I remember the first time I say you up in those jeans
I give it all up too ya'll
Cause you know you my boo
And I ain't have a clue
Your love is like voodoo
We got matching tattoos
My boy said I'm a fool
They said that you was cruel
But I'm breaking the rules
Now its time to review
In the streets I out grew
Quit the game all for you
Shopping sprees in Peru
Gucci Louie Prada Dolce I buy it all for you
Bought you your first Mercedes
Cause I thought you was lazy
But since you had my baby
You won't have to work lady
Wifey type you all ready know your love drive me crazy

Damn right your worth it
Fuck me good on purpose
Make your ex so jealous
Cause you driving reckless
Baby let me tell you that I promise
Cause our love is so platonic
Cause you know you was nervous
Cause I am ah so famous
Ex models yeah I dated
Groupie girls yeah I tainted
Fans see me yeah they fainted
Ex girls they want to hate it
Because they best friends be like damn I wanna see him naked
I know I'm right
But sweetie you alright
Its just been me and you no reason to fuse and to fight
You ask me I'll tell ya
I just might put in flight
If you feeling so right
Marriage just might be right
