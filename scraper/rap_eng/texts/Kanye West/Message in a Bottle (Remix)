[Verse 1: Sting]
Just a castaway
An island lost at sea
Another lonely day
With no one here but me
More loneliness
Than any man could bear
Rescue me before I fall into despair

[Chorus: Sting]
I'll send an SOS to the world
I'll send an SOS to the world
I hope that someone gets my
I hope that someone gets my
I hope that someone gets my
Message in a bottle
Message in a bottle

[Verse 2: Sting]
A year has passed since I wrote my note
But I should have known this right from the start
Only hope can keep me together
Love can mend your life
But love can break your heart

[Chorus: Sting]
I'll send an SOS to the world
I'll send an SOS to the world
I hope that someone gets my
I hope that someone gets my
I hope that someone gets my
Message in a bottle

[Interlude: Sting + Kanye West]
Mr. Kanye West, everybody
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Put your hands in the air

[Verse 3: Kanye West]
I'm sendin' a message in a bottle
It says we need a new tomorrow
And we need some new leaders to follow
Yeah we need some new leaders to follow
I'm tellin' you everything that I know
Al Gore got robbed cause he got my vote
And I'ma tell you this because I should
Sting, you the only police good in the hood
And, and, now throw your hands in the air
And, and, we gon' elect John for mayor
And wave 'em around like you just don't care, yeah
Wave 'em around like you just don't care, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Outro: Sting + Kanye West]
Sending out an SOS
We can save the world
Sending out an SOS
Sending out an SOS
We can save the world
Sending out an SOS
We can save the world
Sending out an SOS
We can save the world
Sending out an SOS
We can save the world
Sending out an SOS

Sending out an SOS
