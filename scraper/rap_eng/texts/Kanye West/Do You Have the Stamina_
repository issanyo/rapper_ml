[Intro: sample from Kanye West's "Pinocchio Story"]
"Do you really have the stamina?
For everybody that sees you that say, 'Where's my camera?'
For everybody that sees you, to say sign a autograph
For everybody that sees you cry, and say you oughta laugh
You oughta laugh!"

[Hook: Kanye West sample] + (B.o.B)
"Do you really have the stamina?"
(Do you have the stamina)
"For everybody that sees you that say, 'Where's my camera?'"
(Where's my camera)
"For everybody that sees you, to say sign a autograph"
(Sign an autograph)
"For everybody that sees you cry, and say you oughta laugh"
(You oughta laugh) "You oughta laugh!"

[Verse One: B.o.B.]
Well, posing for pictures and living on a poster
The hardest thing for me is to keep my composure
I ain't always happy, and I ain't always sad
But when the spotlight is on, you have to handle the task
And even the people who swear they love so bad
A go and put your dirty laundry on the cover of mags
Then everyone sees it and gets a good laugh
And now your whole persona is just a thing of the past
Now, when people see they ignore all the pain
They only think about the rumors and mistakes you made
So that's why I don't read all the comments on the blogs
Everybody's a fan if you boo me or applaud
Now give me your energy, even if you're my enemy
Or trying to be friends with me, aggressively or timidly
Put my next to anyone in this industry
You still will never find someone that's in my league

[Hook]

[Verse Two: B.o.B.]
Celebrity this, celebrity that
Reality TV fiends addicted like crack and smack
My business is rap, and my business is politicing with that
And then my business is put on the map
Yeah, the bigger I get, the better the hat
The better the slacks, the better the shirts, the more I adapt
The more you pay attention to my sentences
The more you'll realize why I'm a lyricist
And why I sacrifice my time for this experience
And why my album still isn't in your speakers yet
You think you know me now, and you ain't even seen me yet
Well, except maybe on your TV set
Bring the bridge
