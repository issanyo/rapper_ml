[Hook]
Don't let them make you believe
That I'm crazy, that I'm crazy

[Verse 1]
I think it's a couple more things they owe us
I think it's a couple more things they owe us
Billions and cars and weed
And mothafuckin' minks is all that they show us
But we are the owners
I think it's a couple more things they owe us

[Hook]
So don't-don't-don't-don't
Don't-don't-don't
Don't let them make you believe
That I'm crazy, nigga I'm not crazy
I'm tellin' you
Don't-don't-don't
Don't-don't-don't
Don't let them make you believe
That I'm crazy, nigga I'm not crazy

[Verse 2]
See that's the magic of racism, it works on itself
We hate each other, screw each other, kill each other
When we can't kill nobody else
See that's the magic of lackin' resources, it works on itself
500 niggas gettin' pop-pop-pop-pop-pop-pop-popped
And North Carolina didn't help
See that's the magic of racism, it works on itself
Niggas hate niggas, hate niggas, hate niggas, hate niggas
Hate niggas, hate niggas, ayy, niggas, ayy, nigga
And I was born in the A, nigga
And my name Ye, nigga, ayy nigga

[Hook]
Don't-don't-don't-don't
Don't-don't-don't
Don't make, make you believe that I'm crazy
I'm not crazy
Don't-don't-don't-don't
Don't-don't-don't
Don't let the media make you believe that I'm
That I'm...

[Outro]
See that's the shit I don't like
