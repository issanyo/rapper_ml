[Intro]
Angel, angel
Angel, angel

[Verse 1: Common]
I spent my day so, first I pray yo
Then I lay low, looking for the halo
Or more yayo, my little angel
Reminded me to stay playful
Faithful walks I take in the woods, thinking what's good
Things that I can change I should
Things I can't, need to be understood
Th-this is the bliss, I used to drift from the hood
For a second at least, I'm resurrecting the peace
Pipes that Indians used to light, we called it Chief, right?
Stepping on the leafs right to reach heights
Th-th-th-that I never seen, it's so so evergreen
Some use it for medicine, or to write better things
I was in Amsterdam man, bike pedalling
To the nature spot to taste the flavors they got
My eyes drop, I like it a lot
Yeah, my angel

[Hook]
I wanna turn up the sound and spread my wings
Because I'm riding with my (angel)
Going through the city of the Chi
Makes me feel like I'm in the city of (angels)
Ohh, I wanna fly, fly away with my (angel)
She takes me high, she will always be my (angel)

[Verse 2: The Game]
Th-th-the way that I rhyme blow nigga's mind
Like the first time you heard Mary J. and you were standing in line
To purchase tickets to see her blow like Chicago wind
And I'm ridin with Common looking for Chicago Zen
And like Chicago winds, I was once a Street Disciple
Rockin every Jordan shoe, Nike put out by Michael
That made me feel like I could fly, sometimes I wanted to die
Prolly cause the angel dust was fuckin with my third eye
So I start hip-hop and I understand why Common used to love her
She got me open so I even had to fuck her
But I used the rubber, cause she was married to Rakim
So I bought me a gold chain, pretendin' that I was him
So I can get close to the girl I loved the most
But she left Cali and went on tour with Ne-Yo and Ghost
Big gave her one more chance and she took Big down
I should've knew when Shock G and Pac told me she get around
An angel

[Hook]
I wanna turn up the sound and spread my wings
Because I'm riding with my (angel)
Going through the city of the Chi
Makes me feel like I'm in the city of (angels)
Ohh, I wanna fly, fly away with my (angel)
She takes me high, she will always be my (angel)

[Verse 3: The Game]
Fly away, fly away
My love for her is not about jewelry and cars
I love her cause she love me, just for who I are
Who I is, who I am, resembles the rims on the Lam'
I shine like Shyne when Barrington Levy was sayin
"Didilly whoooa!", I got love for the streets
Peace to New York and every hood in the East
Before I was duckin' cops, gunshots
I used to be an L.A. Dodger, now I'm a (angel)
From the city of lost souls, Impalas and polished gold
Between the car and the rims, we got a lot of chrome
Your hood not alone, they knockin, we not at home
And when they bust in, we not Caesar, but gotta roam
Cause they try to wire phones, I'm talking Verizon phones
The ones they put wires on, they got us on tap
But I put wires on, my Bentley in fact
I spit it through the wires on a Kanye track

[Hook]
I wanna turn up the sound and spread my wings
Because I'm riding with my (angel)
Going through the city of the Chi
Makes me feel like I'm in the city of (angels)
Ohh, I wanna fly, fly away with my (angel)
She takes me high, she will always be my (angel)

[Outro: Common]
Yeah, it's The Game and Common
Spread your wings, follow your dreams
Things will be so serene
L.A. and the Chi is a team
Yeah, angel supreme, yeah, keep on
Yeah, it's for the world boy
We do it forever, yeah
