Hurry, hurry, hurry

Keep your eyes all on this fatty
If you like what you see take your hands and grab it

Late night get like all this real magic
Ride it automatic till the sun come up, ooh

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Bad Trinidadian, need to let daddy in
If I need to spend some cash, fuck it, then, I'm zaddy, then
She in love with a man she can’t be with
But she know that pussy gon' leave him seasick
Every time she round, she get treat like the sidekick
Until that side chick went and got some side dick
Sun-kissed princess, gold toe ring
Smacker lip gloss, backside swole thing

[Chorus: Teyana Taylor]
Keep your eyes all on this fatty
If you like what you see take your hands and grab it
Hurry, hurry
Hurry, hurry
Late night get like all this real magic
Ride it automatic till the sun come up, ooh
Early, early
Early, early

[Verse 2: Teyana Taylor]
I don’t know no patience, ain't got no more time to waste
Serious need that one or two or three more times after foreplay
Rocket-rocket-rocket-rocket ship blast like it's Jimmy Neutron
Told him fuck me good with them Jimmy Choo's on
I can't wait till you're all on me, yeah (yer-yer-yer-yerhhh)
You know I love it, love it, love it, love it (uuhh, uuhh)

[Chorus: Teyana Taylor]
Keep your eyes all on this fatty (uuhh)
If you like what you see take your hands and grab it
Hurry, hurry

Late night get like all this real magic
Ride it automatic till the sun come up, ooh
Early, early

Keep your eyes all on this fatty
If you like what you see take your hands and grab it
Hurry, hurry
Hurry, hurry
Late night get like all this real magic
Ride it automatic till the sun come up, ooh
Early, early
Early, early
