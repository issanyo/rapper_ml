[Verse 1 - Kanye West]
Tell me right now
Do you really want to spend your whole life alone?
A little time out might do you good
Might do us good, before we be done for good
Cause I can make it good, I can make it hood
I can make you come, I can make you go
I can make you high, I can make it fly
Make it touch the sky, Hey maybe so
All of the time you be up in my checkin' through my cellphone, baby no
You wanna kill the vibe on another night, here's another fight
Oh, here we go (x6)

[Chorus - Kanye West]
Why are you so paranoid?
Why are you so paranoid?
Why are, why are you so paranoid?

[Verse 2 - Redfoo]
They said that drum machines ain't got no soul
They said rap was a fad, but its surpassed rock and roll
Yeah my jeans are tight, and my hoes is white
And they play my songs, in the club, every night
We done lit the fuse, we done fuckin' blew
Blame it on the goose but don't blame it on the auto tunes, oh

[Chorus - Kanye West]
Why are you so paranoid?
Why are you so paranoid?
Why are, why are you so paranoid?

[Verse 3 - SkyBlu]
Tight pants, Party Rock shirt
She on my jock (uh-huh), no need to flirt (nah)
Haters mad, say I look funny (oh)
But how you look funny with a pocket fulla' money? (can't do it)
Stay grillin', imma stay chillin'
Shots all around when a nigga in the buildin'
Party Rock, album in stores
Get one for your mama and one for your hoe!

[Bridge]

[Chorus - Kanye West]
Why are you so paranoid?
Why are you so paranoid?
Why are, why are you so paranoid?
