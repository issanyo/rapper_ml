[Intro: R. Kelly]
The rulers! Rulers of the world!!!!
Every hood, stand up, every street, stand up
And be accountable, yeah, come on....

[Verse 1: R. Kelly]
Sunglasses (Glasses) Black T man (T man)
Red carpet all cameras on me man (Me man)
But the cameras can't see what I see man (See man)
Why I had to treat the haters like fleas man
Mu'fuckers wanna talk about me man
I check the ice and I brush off my sleaves man
I'm too hyped to have dirt off my shoulders
Lyrics from heaven CHUUCH!!! Thought I told ya

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
I know it's been a while sweetheart
We hardly talk I was doing my thang
I know it was foul baby
A bay, lately, you been all on my brain
And if somebody woulda told me a month ago
Frontin though, yo I wouldn't wanna know
If somebody woulda told me a year ago
It'll go get this difficult
Feelin like Katrina with no F.E.M.A
Like Martin with no Gina
Like a flight with no visa
First class with the seat back I still see ya
In my past, you on the other side of the glass
Of my memory's museum
I'm just sayin, hey Mona Lisa come home
You know you can't +Rome+ without +Caesar+

[Chorus: Dwele]
As I recall I know you love to show off (Off)
But I never thought that you would take it this far (Far)
What do I know? (Flashing... lights)
What do I know? (Flashing... lights)
Knoowwwwwwwwwwww!!!!!!!!!!!
As I recall I know you love to show off (Off)
But I never thought that you would take it this far (Far)
What do I know? (Flashing... lights)
What do I know? (Flashing... lights)
Knoowwwwwwwwwwww!!!!!!!!!!!

[Outro: R. Kelly]
Come on! So flash your light on me (Flash your light on me)
So that the world can see (So the world can see)
