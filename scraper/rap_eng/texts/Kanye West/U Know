[Kanye West - talking]
I just got off the plane Chicago
It's ya boy Kanye West on the beat
Ay White Boy

[Hook x2: Kanye West]
I just want you to know, I just want you to know
I just want you to know, this boy here finna' blow
Southside up in here, Westside up in here
Eastside up in here, throw your hands in the air

[Kanye West]
Kanye the best in the game, now we got that, that thing clear
Kanye West is the name, Southside up in here
Y'all niggas stole the soul, y'all niggas all some clones
Y'all need to change y'all tone, nigga I control the gold
Motherfucker close the do', light the weed and let the douja blow
Why you keep bawlin' though girl, you ain't been around hoes before?
Why my chain rosey gold, why my wrist below zero
How the hell I know B-Lo, why them girls tell you no means no
No means no just as sure as green means go, green means paper
Dream team, caper we see haters like shorty on the 'Sixth Sense'
Y'all finna' see some dead people, come through ya block and air people
My people ain't scared people, only FIG-I-AIR people

[Hook x1]

[White Boy]
White Boy back in the mix, and I'm in the atmosphere
Crunkin' for stackin' the fifth, and we got them gats in here
This is not a game, Cris is not a lame
Chi-town drop the flame, White Boy got them thangs
White Boy a hot damn shame, White Boy hot like mars
Y'alls flow hot like March, y'all can't stop these bars
White Boy drop these charts, White Boy got the ball
Lyrics gon' shock you all, Cris gon' cop them cars
Get a couple foxy broads, out they shoes socks and bra
This is not so hard, Cris got a rocky heart
Pimp wit' a monster walk, Cris got hostile thoughts
Y'all better watch it dawg, me and West rock you dawg

[Hook 2x]

[White Boy]
Rap profit, plat gothic, slash convict raps jock it, phat
Pockets mac, hopin' crack, poppin' stacks
Droppin' cakes, stoppin' wakes, knockin' hate
And you fakes, watchin' base, on relate
Gossip fakes and I make, opt-Yeah
In case I catch a case gots to pay, confrentrate
Need ya way, from this place, cause it ain't common (nope)
If this ain't the way, Kan-ye, then it's straight
Colleges, in ya veins cause you spit what you came from
Straight knowledge, I was raised in the street
Praised in my heat, holdin' on my Nextel
Hopin' for the next cell, focused on the best cell
Smokin' on a fresh L, posted like FedEx mail

[Hook 2x]
