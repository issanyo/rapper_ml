[Hook: ?]
Left, right, right, left
We go left, right, right, left
C'mon left, right, right, left
We gon tighten up our boots and march till it ends, c'mon
Left, right, right, left
We go left, right, right, left
C'mon left, right, right, left
We gon tighten up our boots and march till it ends

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
This a story about a bad girl that used to be good
A miseducation of Lauren that stayed in the hood
See she probably could have made it in Hollywood
But she was misguided, misled, and misunderstood
She wanted her baby dad with good hair like Blair Underwood
And push a whip with 12 cylinders under the hood
[?]
Now she got 6 kids to feed under her roof
She didn't want her daughters to end up in the same position
So she named one hope named the other ambition
[?]
But the problems with poverty left them with no choice
Then one got locked
Then one got popped
[?]
Don't worry Mom
