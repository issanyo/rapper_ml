[Intro: Kanye West (Tim Westwood)]
Doesn't get much better than that (Nah!)
So unfair, so.. unfair advantage
(Yo, it doesn't feel much better than that)

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
It's the dream, it's Kobe and Jordan on the same team
In the best prime of their game and the same Kanye
You know the name and it's not pronounced Kane
And every time, you know I spit that flame
Ayo we gettin' out our dreams, gettin' out our dreams
And we gonna buy some things, and we got him out of Queens
Talkin' 'bout my man Consequence, once for the Tribe
Talkin' 'bout my man GLC and now he's around
Talkin' 'bout John Legend, take 'em all the way to Heaven
Speakin' of Heaven, Common speaks the heavenly words
The nouns and verbs and whatever you heard
Whatever synonym, we killin' 'em, everybody feelin' him
The people's choice, the people's champ like Paul Wall
All haters, I gotta say fuck all y'all
No, I won't waste my energy no more
I have to be more concerned about Sierra Leone
I'm talkin' 'bout people that's dyin' for diamonds
And the way that uh
They got uh, capa
What I want to say, monopoly over the country
And every time you say somethin' people act funky
The diamond industry want me, they say I'm bringin' out the bad
What I want, people to stop buyin' diamonds?
No, I want everybody to stop lyin'
They say conflicts is only one percent, and look at all the money rappers spent
We throw the diamonds in the screen, nah mean?
But it affects the families cause people is dyin' for these things
I mean in the diamond rivers they'll mine all day
And might only get paid two cups of rice a day
Is this the price to pay for the icy way?
We like to floss away, even your boy 'Ye
With my Jesus piece, I gave diamonds to my niece
If I had a brother, Kanye, Common made "I Used to Love H.E.R."
Used to love her and I still do, lyrically I kill you
Dog I don't feel you, your style is like mildew
Real old, I'm real cold, listen to this beat, real soul
Your style is real old, dollar bill fold
Stackin' money ain't funny, and I'm out in UK
And I ask 'em who's the best, and they say "you K"
Ooh way ooh way
Yeah I feel it and I gotta kick it off the top of the dome
Microphone controller, that's an M.C., it's in me
I can lead a crowd, I went to your show, it's empty
Go to my shit, it's sold out, every single seat
Every time I drop, because like Shaq, I bring the heat
And anybody that freestyle on the level that I do
Should be winnin' Grammys too
So if you do it like me, you can do it like this
And uh, they say I'm a teacher like the one called Kris
That's KRS but nah it's Kanye West
And every time I spit the rhymes, uh straight off the flesh
I could bring it down to the bone straight from the heart
And from the heart is where I did it 'fore I ever chart
And then I spit it, we get it, we did it, we do it a lot
Kanye spit it, we do it, we makin' it hot
I got patterns like Saturn, the rings, the rings
Uh, Gold Digger, that's the single, the single
Gotta hit the club just to mingle, to mingle
Why you all in my face? I'm tryna do my thing dude
Back off, I'll have Barry smack the fuck out of you
Everybody wanna know what they can get out you
Aww here's my demo, dawg, here's my group
Dawg, please back me up, you're heated up, you're soup
Y'all gassed, I passed, I flow, I rhyme
I'm uh, that's the way, that yah boy gotta shine
Straight from the Chi city, everybody ride with me
And you see the same questions and I gotta teach the lesson
This some, this some sick freestylin', I hear you're readin' it
I gotta keep goin' cause y'all fans, y'all needin' it
Uh, you say I'm too high like I smoke weed in it
And they say "he arrogant, he's always conceited, shit"
Well what you want from me? Y'all just can't stop me
You could look in my pants and tell that I'm cocky

[Bridge 1: Kanye West (Tim Westwood)]
(Laughing)
(Oh my God, Oh my God)
(Damn) Yeah
We back, we back like we ever left, huh
(Crazy!)
Like we ever left, huh, like we e', like we ever left, huh
Like we ever left, uh, uh, uh, yeah, yeah

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Can I get an encore, do you want more?
Kanye on the Westwood Tour
Chillin' with Westwood
Go to Chicago, that's Kanye West's hood
And the label called G.O.O.D
Should I holla at these bitches? You should
You might need one, you might need one
You might fuck one
If you eat out like McDonald's
I ain't no clown like Ronald
Uh, more like Donald
Trump, with the way I get it crunk
Like my man Lil Jon, but call him Lil Kan'
He all the same, flow like Lil Wayne on Tha Carter
And I'm signed to the Carter faculty
'Cause the Roc is in back of me
Actually, that look like stacks to me
Ch-ching, ch-ching
Yah nahmean, yah nahmean, I'm doin' my thing
Out in U.K., London
And they call me number one
Japan, you're number one
That's Ichiban
And I learned that from KRS-One
Won once again like One
Like Puff, my friend, and One
One, give me one of them
Talkin' 'bout one drink, one hand
One cup of Henny, one cup of Hypno
If you ran out of it, yo, you got to get more
And I might sip slow but I never sip Mo
I sip Cris-o, Cris-y-Cris
And I gotta break it down like Missy Miss
She had the "hee hee, who got the keys?"
You don't need that if you got the no start V
Where you push the button, that ain't nothin'
All y'all talkin' somethin', y'all stay frontin'
Kanye dropped the beats to get 'em jumpin'
Lucifer, top of the morning to yah
Cheerio, hit up the flow, bring it back, oh
From Chicago, uh
And I'm rockin' the Dolce Gabbana
Fashionable persona
GQ, who knew he'd be the flyest?
Like T.W.A.C.W.K
K.A.N.Y W.E.S.T
Be the B.E.S.T

[Bridge 2: Kanye West (Tim Westwood)]
You know, I'mma stop it right there
(Laughs) I just, I just feel like
I 'on't know if I feel like rappin' right now
(Oh my God!)

I got raps for yah, uh huh
I got raps for yah
I got, uh, I got raps for yah
We goin' to mass today, we have to pray
Besides what the pastor say
Uh, uh
I 'on't know, I 'on't know what
I got so many joints right know, runnin' through my head
I 'on't even know what to yeah
What should, what should I spit?
I could just freestyle off of these messages
Please can you tell
Okay this is a girl writin' this
Please can you tell my uh, boyfriend Danny
That I love him loads, with all my heart
And I can't wait to see him tomorrow

[Verse 3: Kanye West]
She can't wait to see you tomorrow Danny
She love you, mhmm
You know what that mean?
You gonna get some
I wonder if she gon' be wearin' one of those tight outfits
And you know that I like that shit
I ain't sayin' I ever met her but come on
You must be pimpin' and you ain't sweat her, you know?
She writin' you on one of these hip-hop shows
Made me wonder if she's a hip-hop ho
No disrespect, you know
I don't know you so
I will not disrespect, so don't please press eject
On the tape cassette, and don't knock it out of your decks
So with much respect, obliged, when I rhyme
Sometimes some things just pop out, sometimes
I must be a, I forgot the medical name
Not a narcoleptic that be sleepin'
How people was sleepin' when I made it deeper
And I gotta be creepin' cause you know they didn't peep it
Uh, they call me Rockafella's best little secret
Uh, I got the beats for the Jeep
When people used to rock Amigo's and Suzuki's
And the Isuzu's, this the way you flow
Do flow, aye yo you just like Menudo
Played out about mad years ago
And uh, I could rock off the top, I got years of flow
I got so many albums to go, at least about seven
Jesus Walks had me all the way
Thought I was gon' rhyme that, no you didn't time that
Yo that's where the line's at
Look at my shows, look how long that the line's at
All the way to the back, sold out, one night
That's the way it is when you done it right
Take time to drop a album, don't just be buyin' beats from everybody
Cause everybody ain't got it, I got it
I get it, I only give it to those who really live it
Like Jay-Z, the Game, and my dogs that really did it
Like Kweli, like Common, like dudes that really spit it
I'm talkin' 'bout they go onto the radio and hit it
And as far as makin' your songs, it's all wrong
You be doin' everything that everybody else is on
Man, I'mma break it down, let me take it down
Here goes the instructions on how to not say nothin'
Look, you take the crack concept
And you do that 'til it's all dead and gone, you do it all wrong
Now uh, you take the car concept
And I see it every video, every single place I go
Same shit

[Bridge 3: Kanye West (Tim Westwood)]
Man you know the beat ran out on me
I was gonna, I was gonna, I was gonna break down
(That was mean, that was mean!) I was gonna break down to people
Exactly how to make the good song and the good album for a change
(Let's go, let's go, let's go!)

[Verse 4: Kanye West]
First of all, what you need's a beat from me
If you can't get a beat from me, get a beat from your guy
He'll prolly do it for free
And if he do it like [?] he'll prolly do it for E
And if he do [?], he'll prolly do it for skeet
Yo, yo-yo, yo-yo-yo, you gotta bring with your flow
You gotta take it on-beat and off-beat
And don't rap on no fuckin' soft beats
You know that real hard shit, regardless, I played my part in this
Like, this Corner beat, this what you want when you want a beat
And that's when you really is gonna be
A hip-hop legend like Kan, like Kan
Like, of course the Louis Vuitton, 'ton, don, don
If I do say so, myself
And I do all the time, every rhyme
Cause I'm, I'm feelin' myself
And if you was me, you'd be feelin' yourself, you see
If you out in London, you just hopped on a plane
And you just came out of the bathroom, you just got you some brain
Uh, you doin' your thing
And plus you flossin' that Rocafella chain
Aye yo, you know you let Kan spit on 'em
I'm rockin' the Rocafella chain with no conflicts on 'em
Oh, oh
Now let me bring it back to the flow, flow
And how you make the album and you make some dough, dough
Get you a good manager cause your manager'll fuck your game up
Fuck your name up
And uh, if you've been runnin' to a [?]
Trade your chain for some studio time
See a lot of people be flossin' before they get a chance to
A lot of people want club records they wanna dance to
A lot of people want basslines, they will enhance you
Bass in the club is good too, what you should do
Is prolly get a single like Alicia Keys
And if you don't know her, holla at Alicia please
You know one of 'em light skin bitches with the braids
Actin' like they got it made
[?] you give a dawg with a fade
You get somebody that's weak, you get somebody that you know can't flow
And you rap before him, and let him go
And people gon' be like well least you was better than dude
And [?] I don't mean to be rude
And another thing you can do
If you could channel the spirits like I channel
I'm not talkin' 'bout lightin' candles, I'm not talkin' sayonce
I'm talkin' 'bout talkin' to God, I mean just like once
What I do before I rhyme, every day is I pray
I pray to God that he make these songs in a certain way
I let him speak through me, through the beats, through the music
I mean, sometimes I go into the booth and lose it
I mean, I know he speakin' when I freak it in it a way
That I coulda never thought of somethin' better to say
So, our father, who art up above us
I know any time we fuck, you still love us
Like when I'm cursin' in my verses and I even do, what's worse is
When I'm spendin' too much, spendin' on purses
And shoes for my girl when I should be helpin' the world
Give back to the charity, he still don't embarrass me
He still let me be, He still keep it real
See that's the thing about humans, we got free will
See the angels gotta do exactly what God want 'em to do
God is still with you, even when we don't do
So, follow the path, follow the laws
Follow the reason, the reasons why it's wrong
You never heard a freestyle like this before-'fore
And I know that hip-hop fans want more

[Outro: Kanye West]
Westwood, what's good
Holla at your boy, Kanye the Louis Vuitton Don
The Roca stay, buildin'
Yeah, it's G.O.O.D. Music baby
After you freestyle like that you just talk shit for about eight minutes
