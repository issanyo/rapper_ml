(Chorus)
I swear, I would lock the door if the cops came and tell em you gone
I swear, I would rest in eternal sleep if they would let you live a little bit more
I swear, I'd give em my right arm, if they would just leave you alone
Tell the truth, how much do I love ya
Tell the truth, more than you'll ever know

(Verse 1)
I' told you from childhood nigga I will always be wit ya
Through hell or hot water it'll be me and you nigga
This can go down in the test of time
Whether Ripley believe it or not, make it happen once in a lifetime
Kinda hard to find, two niggas that growed up on two different sides of town
That get down like I get down, and done his like I done mine
Hit it off first time around, been solid as the foundation under the house
This some, shit for us to brag about (bout it bout it)
We answered the question and never had to take the time to think out
That's why I'll ride for my nigga, cry for my nigga
Die for my nigga
Hold ya one hand in the sky for ya nigga
Tell them you gone always remember

(Chorus)

(Verse 2)
You know you one of the reasons I'm still breathin cause without you I don't know where in the hell I would be
(homeboy)
You know life's been hard at home (homeboy)
That's what made us turn to the streets (homeboy)
I think that's what had us claimin thugs, sellin drugs
Duckin from the fuckin police, indulgin in
Booze and women, foolish niggas
Young, dumb, and off the leash
Outta control, but I wouldn't change it
If I could I would do it the same (if I can do it)
But if it wasn't for the game, teachin us game
We prolly would be stuck with the lames (but DAWG)
Somehow we made it, and I'm glad that I can tell ya today
That my nigga gone always be my nigga
Cuz that's the way it's â€˜pose to be

(Chorus)

(Bridge)
Sometimes I wanna play some ball, Sometimes I wanna walk through the mall
(Sometimes I Wanna play some ball, and just walk through the mall)
Sometimes it ain't about the broads, and I just wanna spend some time alone
(Sometimes it ain't about the broads, and I just wanna spend some time alone wit my niggas)
Sometimes I wanna hop in the car, and drive till tomorrow
(Sometimes I wanna hop in the car, and just drive till tomorrow)
Sometimes I wanna pick the phone, just to see what's goin on
(Sometimes I gotta pick up the phone, just to see what's goin on wit my niggas)

(Chorus 2x's)
