[Intro: Kanye West]
Hello, you there?
Yeah, I'm here
You breaking up, I can barely hear you
Naw, you clear
You cool? you mad?
You talk? bad
You up? You been good?
Naw I been bad
What you mean, you been bad?
Baby girl you know I got bad nerves
Got me cursing with the kids in the car
"Mommy, daddy using bad words!"
No more tripping while you at work
No more texting while I'm at church
No more switching up the password
That's the shit that get your ass hurt

[Chorus: Alicia Keys]
We got way too much in common
If I'm being honest with you
We got way too much in common
Since I'm being honest with you

[Post-Chorus: Alicia Keys]
Who wants to love somebody like me?
You wanna love somebody like me?
If you could love somebody like me
You must be messed up too
Who wants to love somebody like me?
You wanna love somebody like me?
If you could love somebody like me
You must be messed up too

[Verse 1: Alicia Keys]
Said I'd be gone by five
But it's sunrise and I'm still in your bed
Goodnight usually means goodbye
Me replaying memories in my head
Look at you, look at you
Look what you made me do
How do you, how do you think know my every move
Who are you? Who are you? You look so familiar
I know you, I know you, baby, I know the truth

[Chorus: Alicia Keys]
We got way too much in common
If I'm being honest with you
We got way too much in common
Since I'm being honest with you

[Post-Chorus: Alicia Keys]
Who wants to love somebody like me?
You wanna love somebody like me?
If you could love somebody like me
You must be messed up too
Who wants to love somebody like me?
You wanna love somebody like me?
If you could love somebody like me
You must be messed up too

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Folks all up in our business
Yeezy Season, I'm trending
I bet you they respect the name now
So are we done or we finished?
Cause no matter what anybody say
We been through shit you can't make up
And at the end of the night bae
We'll be back in bed like we famous

[Verse 3: Travis Scott & Alicia Keys]
We got way too much in common
Way too in common
Drama, gotta silence
The violence, gotta link up
For my black skin, the brown ones
Yeah, you can't check us, CNN
Get your baggage, this nigga BET
And everybody taking EBT
Ice cold, my jewelers, go up
Be careful what you wish and hope for
Made it from the hood to the road when the grind was dope
Made it from the hood to the road when the grind was dope

[Chorus: Alicia Keys]
We got way too much in common
If I'm being honest with you
We got way too much in common
Since I'm being honest with you

[Post-Chorus: Alicia Keys]
Who wants to love somebody like me?
You wanna love somebody like me?
If you could love somebody like me
You must be messed up too
Who wants to love somebody like me?
You wanna love somebody like me?
If you could love somebody like me
You must be messed up too
