It's still bigger than hip hop, hip hop, hip hop, hip
It's bigger than hip hop, hip hop, hip hop, hip hop

Uhh, uhh, uhh One thing 'bout music when it's real they get scared
Got us slavin for the welfare, ain't no food, clothes, or healthcare
I'm down for guerilla warfare All my niggas put your guns in the air
If you really don't care Skunk in the air, make a nigga wanna buck in the air
For my brother locked up In the jump for a year, shit is real out here don't believe these videos
This fake ass industry gotta pay to get a song on the radio
Really though, DP'z gon' let you know: it's just a game of pimps and hoes
And it's all 'bout who you know, not who we are, or how we grow
I rap 'bout what I know, what I go through, what I been through, not just for no dough
Even though the rent due, what I'm into ain't for no dough
Or just no fame, everything must change, nothin remains the same
Sick of the same ol' thang, it's bigger than "Bling Bling"

If I feel it, I feel it, if I don't, I don't
If it ain't really real, then I probably won't
Rollin with my soldiers, live soldiers, ready to ride
For this real hip hop, y'all, I'm ready to die

Uhh, hip, what, hop, what, hip, what, hop, what, hip, what, hop, what, hip, what, c'mon

My soldiers, live soldiers, ready to ride
For this real hip hop y'all I'm ready to die

Hip hop means sayin what I want never bite my tongue hip hop means teaching the young
If you feelin what I'm feelin then you hearin what I'm sayin cause these fake fake records just keep on playin
What you sayin huh DP bringin the funk Let the bassline rattle your trunk, uhhh!
Punk pig wit a badge wanna handcuff me cuz my pants that's tend to sag
Hip hop means throw up your rag, soldier flag whether ridin on the bus or you stole a jag
M-1 mean freedom, burn the cash revolutionary love til the day we pass
Will they play it on the radio maybe not, maybe so we gon keep it pumpin though
Everybody know we headed for the whoa, fo sho

Ay, dogg, that label is that slave ship owners got them whips
And rappers is slaves If you really wanna eat you gotta hear the same thing
With the football, b-ball, or if you slangin that dope
Ain't never seen no hope, brainwash video shows be foolin my folk
What the hell a brother gon do though, huh, when the rent due, when the lights and the gas
Gonna get cut off, drop them raps or cock them gats
Ain't never had shit ever since we came to this bitch
Why I gotta feel pain to get rich 'stead of stackin chips, finna pack them clips

If I feel it, I feel it, if I don't, I don't
If it ain't really real, then I probably won't
Rollin with my soldiers, live soldiers, ready to ride
For this real hip hop, y'all, I'm ready to die
Uhh

Ride to this if you miss 2Pac (come, come)
Bounce to this if you love Big Poppa

My soldiers, live soldiers, ready to ride
For this real hip hop, y'all, I'm ready to die

Uhh, hip, what, hop, what, hip, what, hop, what, hip, what, hop, what, hip, what, c'mon
It's bigger than hip, what, hop, what, hip, yeah, hop, what, hip, what, hop, what, hip, what, c'mon
It's bigger than hip, what, hop, ride, hip, ride, hop, ride, hip, yeah, hop, yeah, hip, bounce, c'mon
It's bigger than hip, what, hop, what, hip, ride, hop, ride, hip, bounce, hop, bounce, hip, yeah, c'mon

If I feel it, I feel it, if I don't, I don't
If it ain't really real, then I probably won't
Rollin with my soldiers, live soldiers, ready to ride
For this real hip hop, y'all, I'm ready to die
Uhh
