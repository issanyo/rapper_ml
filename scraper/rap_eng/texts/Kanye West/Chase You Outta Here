[Verse]
I told niggas I'm a hustler, it's like they keep on forgetting
36 mil in 8 months, you still think I'm bullshitting?
Catch me on top of Fortune's Hot 100
Head of G-Unit Enterprises, still getting blunted
Went from selling crack to rap, that's two different games
But they're parallel to each other, homie, so they're quite the same
You know that crack spot so hot, you better off playing the block
Fiends can't help but be fiends, they come and cop for the cops
Back in the pens again, penitentiary doors spin
The game full of heartbreaks, can I win for Christ sakes?
Ace after ace, Lady Luck just won't fuck with me
That's why I got this attitude, nigga don't say what up to me
I took something heart-pumping, move and I'll pop something
Cop bricks, break 'em down to pieces and prop something
Niggas stay in stunt mode so I stay strapped up
My body language saying ''fuck around and get clapped up''
I sip on Coke when it's with Henny, go for broke with the semi
Niggas talk behind my back, but they don't really want it with me
Pussy niggas pop shit, me I'm on that block shit
That rubber band, hundred grand in that night box, bitch
You know the raps bought the Benz, and the crack's bought the rims
Vivica she bought the gym, told ya I'm a fuckin' pimp
I was born a bad seed, I defied the odds
I ain't play the hand I was dealt, I switched the cards
Still I keep a poker face, frontin' I'mma catch a case
Flip out, poke your face, you're laid out, now what a waste
I'm Super Fly Ron O'Neal of this rap shit
When that drama pop and you get shot
Let's see you bounce back, bitch

[Hook]
You nigga, you come around this bitch frontin'
I'mma have to chase you outta here
