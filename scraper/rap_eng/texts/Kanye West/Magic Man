[Hook: Kanye West]
I am the magic man
Got the world in his hands, world in his hands
He said I am the magic man, world in his hands, world in his hands
Is anybody out there?

[Verse 1: Kanye]
The magic man
The show goes on in 6 minutes and this is his lovely assistant
She's so beautiful don't you agree?
He made her to the star she always wanted to be
Buhblaaoowww, are those the stars you wanted to see?
The magic man could make the roof disappear in every car in his fleet
Was on dubs, he could take a bird flip it to 3
Release the doves, turn any bar into the fight club
Gotta fight every night to prove my love
You messing with this joker but you need a king
Cause he'll club anybody trying to jack his queen
I'mma call a spade a spade from the start
He gave you diamonds, should've gave you his heart, you see?
Jealousy strikes again, but she, said I'm just trying to wave at the man
Then he, turned her eyes black and blue with the wave of his hand
The Magic Man

[Verse 2: Malik Yousef]
The magic man
Abracadabra, from a dime piece to pieces of a dime bag lady
Each package, new baggage
Implemented a tragic plan
A volunteer from the audience, for the magic man
I have doubt my hat with natural flowers
She wanted work but wouldn't put any actual hours
Her dude had the keys to super natural powers
So she still with this new guy who can supply that white tiger like Siegfried & Roy
Indeed the boy, had that sweet street magic like David Blaine and she made it plain
If I had any advice that could save her, I could just save it man, and I can't understand that baby
She said you ain't no Houdini, ahhhh I know I ain't
I am an artist that can help you escape
Do y'all feel that, or is it cold just in here
For his next trick, Ta-da, he made her soul disappear
The magic man

[Verse 3: Common]
The magic man
Voila!, she knew that I was into the stars
I didn't have to tip her, she was into my bars
A Tender, as slender as the pictures you remember, when you were younger
You wonder how she get from under, the sheets
She do a trick and keep it discreet
She wore a mink, fuck a rabbit just to keep the mystique
High like the magic frank had in the streets
In the sweetest way her status and her habits are meet
Its kinda tragic to see, this young woman cut in half
Thought she was the one but she couldn't do the math
In a flash, so fast i watch her ass disappear
He had game, pulled a quarter from the back of her ear, and macked in her ear
And played with her dreams, in a world where everything ain't the way that it seems
Under her spell, she let any dave cop a feel, I tried to tell the girl the magic man is not for real
The magic man
