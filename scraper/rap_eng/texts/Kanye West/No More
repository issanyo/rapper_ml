Oh

[Hook]
You can't see me no more
You can't hold me no more
You can't see me no more
You can try, oh you can try
You can't see me no more
You can't hold me no more
You can't see me no more
You can try, oh you can try

[Verse]
Walk in heavens, hallelujah
Feel the trials, but I'ma triumph
Nothin' to worry, not in a hurry
You can say what you want, quit standin' like a mummy
Oh, I'm lovin' the life that I'm livin' right now
Have friends in high places right now
I'm makin' more than I'm spendin' right now
People talkin', tryna start that shit with me right now
Oh I'm lovin' that
Oh I'm lovin' that
Oh I'm lovin' that
Oh I'm love, oh
Oh I'm lovin' that
Oh I'm love....

[Hook]
You can't see me no more
You can't hold me no more
You can't see me no more
You can try, oh you can try
You can't see me no more
You can't hold me no more
You can't see me no more
You can try, oh you can try

[Bridge]
Hmm yeaaaaah
Hmm yeaaaaah
I'm tired of this shit now
Quit this shit now
Tired of this hmmm now
Oh shit; What do I do now?
I said I said I know

[Hook]
You can't see me no more
You can't hold me no more
You can't see me no more
You can try, oh you can try
You can't see me no more
You can't hold me no more
You can't see me no more
You can try, oh you can try
