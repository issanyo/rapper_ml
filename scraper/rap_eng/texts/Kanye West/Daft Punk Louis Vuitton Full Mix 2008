N-now th-that that don't kill me
Can only make me stronger
I need you to hurry up now
‘Cause I can't wait much longer
I know I got to be right now
‘Cause I can't get much wronger
Man, I've been waiting all night now
That's how long I been on ya
Work it harder, make it better
Do it faster, makes us stronger
(I need you right now!)
(I need you right now!)
Harder, better, faster, stronger
I don't know if you got a man or not
If you made plans or not
If God put me in your plans or not
I'm trippin', this drink got me saying a lot
But I know that God put you in front of me
So how the hell could you front on me?
There's a thousand you's, there's only one of me
I'm trippin', I'm caught up in the moment, right?
‘Cause it's Louis Vuitton Don night
‘Cause it's Louis Vuitton Don night
‘Cause it's Louis Vuitton Don night
Well, I'd do anything for a blonde dyke
‘Cause it's Louis Vuitton Don night
‘Cause it's Louis Vuitton Don night
‘Cause it's Louis Vuitton Don night
Well, I'd do anything for a blonde dyke
And she'll do anything for the limelight
And we'll do anything when the time's right
Uh, baby, you're makin' it
(Harder, better, faster, stronger)
N-now th-that that don't kill me
Can only make me stronger
