[HOOK: (Consequence)]
(You got to...)
Relax yourself, or we'll back you down
Relax yourself, or we'll back you down
Relax yourself, or we'll back you down
Relax yourself, or we'll back you down
Relax yourself, or we'll back you down
All day long man, we back in town

[Consequence]
Homie check it out I got her mesmerized
So when your hooker choose Cons, she telling you "Bye"
Street poetry is how your boy get paid
In that brand new Escalade, metallic, black or beige
And when I walk up in the club, you know I do not pay
Aiiyo my man Kanyeezy, he got something to say

[Kanye West]
Aiyyo my name is Kanyeezy from the Roc-A fam
Where the Glocks don't jam, so when we pop, them scrams
See I showed you on "The Champions" how we get down
So don't twist your lips up like Bobby Brown
You got B2K all on your bedroom wall
But if you be with Kan', I'm gonna work your walls
Straight from the South Side of them Chi-Town streets
The top three in the game, with these here beats

[Consequence]
And if you talk about him, aiyyo I take you out
Either with the nine, or the Tec's in his mouth
And if that dime getting friendly then the orgy's at eight
But y'all niggas don't shine, so you couldn't relate

[HOOK: (Consequence)]
Relax yourself, or we'll back you down
(You couldn't relate)
Relax yourself, or we'll back you down
(You couldn't relate)
Relax yourself, or we'll back you down
So relax yourself, or we'll back you down
Relax yourself, or we'll back you down
Relax yourself, or we'll back you down

[Consequence]
Quence was out the game, now he's back to ball
Drive you insane, drop a tat at the mall
You staring at my rose gold way too long
But I ain't scared to ride, that's why I wear Teflon
I took her on the ave' and she expect me to trip
But I made her window shop while I bought me some kicks
So if you want the drama, holler at your boy

[Kanye West]
Original rude boy like Pastor Troy
The G-500 is my favorite toy
They say "he don't look like a thug or a hood"
"But he keep them gorilla's, so he still be good"
By the way my name is K, don't forget the A
And the N-Y-E, out N.Y.C
I'mma still rep the gold, no matter where I go
Everybody say I'm hot, I'm sayin I'm cold
Hate when niggas leave the city and switch up they raps
On the real homie, I don't get down like that
I'mma milk the game, 'til we all can eat

[Consequence]
Now the Chocolate Factory is what I bump in my jeep
So roll me up a L, but don't lace it with leak
'Cause that shit'll have me zoning for a couple of weeks

[Kanye West]
Now your momma told you let the cleavage show
'Cause that's the best way, to get a nigga with dough
They'll fake a pregnancy, and call the attorney up
But she ain't know I'm cheaper than IKEA furniture

[Consequence]
Kanye, White, Malik, Little and D
Menace, Skates to Lou and the Puffs from L.B
They know that Consequence be wearing gold and ice
Cause I got out the projects, where it's flooded with mice
Eh shorty, let me tell you 'bout the rules of my nights
It seems I always keep it moving, I don't hit nothing twice

[HOOK: {Consequence} (Kanye West)]
So relax yourself, or we'll back you down
{Don't hit nothing twice}
Relax yourself, or we'll back you down
{Don't hit nothing twice}
Relax yourself, or we'll back you down
So relax yourself, or we'll back you down
Relax yourself, or we'll back you down
Relax yourself, or we'll back you down
Relax yourself, or we'll back you down
Relax yourself, or we'll back you down
Relax yourself, or we'll back you down
Relax yourself, or we'll back you down
All day long man, we back in town
(We back in town)
Relax yourself, or we'll back you down
(We back in town)
Relax yourself, or we'll back you down
(We back in town
Relax yourself, or we'll back you down
(We back in town)
Relax yourself, or we'll back you down
(We back in town)
Relax yourself, or we'll back you down
