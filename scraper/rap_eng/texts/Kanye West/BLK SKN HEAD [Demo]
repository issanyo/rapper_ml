[Intro]
AAAA!!!
AAAA!!!
AAAA!!!
AAAA!!!

[Verse 1]
For my theme song
My leather black jeans on
My by-any-means on
Pardon, I'm getting my scream on
Enter the kingdom
But watch who you bring home
They see a black man with a white woman
At the top floor they gone come to kill King Kong
Middle America packed in
Came to see me in my black skin
My money was number one draft pick
They still burned his jersey in Akron
If I don't get ran out by Catholics
Here come some conservative Baptists
Claiming I'm overreactin'
Like them black kids in Chiraq bitch

[Hook]
Four in the mornin', and I'm zonin'
They say I'm possessed, it's an omen
I keep it 300, like the Romans
300 bitches, where the Trojans?
Baby we livin' in the moment
I've been a menace for the longest
But I ain't finished, I'm devoted
Y'all can't keep playing with my emotions

[Bridge]
So follow me up cause this shit 'bout to go DOWN
I'm doing 500, I'm outta control NOW
But there's nowhere to go NOW
And there's no way to slow DOWN
Runnin' outta time - movin' fast
So just sit back and enjoy the crash

[Hook]
Four in the mornin', and I'm zonin'
They say I'm possessed, it's an omen
I keep it 300, like the Romans
300 bitches, where the Trojans?
Baby, we livin' in the moment
I've been a menace for the longest
But I ain't finished, I'm devoted
And you know this, and you know this

[Verse 2]
Stop all that coon shit
Early morning cartoon shit
This is that goon shit
Fuck up your whole afternoon shit
I'm aware I'm a wolf
Soon as the moon hit
I'm aware I'm a king
Back out the tomb bitch
Black out the room, bitch
Stop all that coon shit
These niggas ain't doin' shit
Them niggas ain't doin' shit
What do you say to a masked man
This Inglorious Bastard thatâ€™s rapping
We might have to burn this whole suit down
Like the theater that Hitler was trapped in

[Hook]
Four in the mornin', and I'm zonin'
I think I'm possessed, it's an omen
I keep it 300 like the Romans
300 bitches, where the Trojans?
Baby, we livin' in the moment
I've been a menace for the longest
But I ain't finished, I'm devoted
Keep it goin', keep it goin'

[Bridge]
So follow me up cause this shit 'bout to go DOWN
I'm doing 500, I'm outta control NOW
But there's nowhere to go NOW
And there's no way to slow DOWN
Runnin' outta time - movin' fast
So just sit back and enjoy the crash
