[Verse 1: Jay-Z]
I'm up out M-a-r-c-y P-r-o-j-e-c-t
Ain't no other motherfucker in the rap game harder than me
I go hard and get it in like a porn star
Follow my moves you wanna make it to the top
I'm OnStar for new born stars
Even when the camera stop
I'ma hundred million dollar movie, hand on my cock
Big Homie from the back block
When you first learned how to slap box
Then you even learned how to dribble the pill
Or to hand the pot, bring it back, rock
Number one rule: if your ass get popped
Don't chatterbox to the Matlocks
Death before dishonor, I'ma honor the code they created
Number 2 Rule and it might sound rude, but...
Yup! Fuck you, pay me!
I drown my pain in Porsches, I lost my partner to the bullshit
Still tryna hold on to my religion so
I put a couple diamonds in the crosses
Close your eyes, see the darkness
That's what it's like where I'm from
No lawyers no doctors
So either I go the hardest or I could just call this a night
On dark nights, it's like I see better
On Dark Knights I'm like Heath Ledger
Even if I overdose on drugs, motherfuckers can't kill my buzz
Wait, I ain't done; I'ma freestyle this, Khaled let it run
What's the hardest county in the Yayo?
'Cause I'ma go harder then they go
I'ma go harder than Baltimore
Philly gon' say they can't touch the boy
Where you at Duval? I'ma go harder than you all
Harder than New York, turn the Pro Tools in the booth off
I'ma go harder than Ye go
And Ye go hard; that's baby bro
Put some more beat on that joint

[Hook: T-Pain]
If you could you would get rid of me
What you gonna do when a nigga got to go hard
But I won't let you get to me
You should already figure I'mma go hard
If you were as real as me
You would never let another nigga step in yo yard
Makin money ain't shit to me
This in my veins and it gets to my heart
So I am, I will, I gots to go
You got another way to live you gots to go on
I am gettin it in until the end I got to go, go, go, go hard

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
I ain't ever been scurred
Never been a type to bite my words
When I came up ya'll gave me shit
Now I'm gunna make ya'll eat them terds
Always said what the fuck I felt
Gon head spit that murder I wrote
Man I dont care what what you felt
Fuck you nigga I know I'm dope
Dope like I'm comin to get my all
Felt like I had to play the fly on the wall
Felt like niggas was stuntin on me
Funny how I'm flyer then them all
Now I'm at the top ain't know where to go now
Instead of me, she gon go down
Maybe I would've slowed down
If I knew what I know now
I'm stupid, yeah I know I'm dumb
It could get fuckin old but its good I'm young
But my heart get cold as the hood I'm from
Tell me what it take to be numba one
I guess its gon be what its gon be
But heres one thing ya'll got to hear
I'mma tell you like George Bush told me
Fuck ya'll niggas I'm out of here

[Hook: T-Pain]
If you could you would get rid of me
What you gonna do when a nigga got to go hard
But I won't let you get to me
You should already figure I'mma go hard
If you were as real as me
You would never let another nigga step in yo yard
Makin money ain't shit to me
This in my veins and it gets to my heart
So I am, I will, I gots to go
You got another way to live you gots to go on
I am gettin it in until the end I got to go, go, go, go hard
