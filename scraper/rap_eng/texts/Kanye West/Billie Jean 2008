[Bridge: Michael Jackson & Kanye West]
People always told me be careful of what you do
And don't go around breaking young girls' hearts
And mother always told me be careful of who you love
And be careful of what you do cause the lie becomes the truth
Hey
Yeah, uh
Uh, uh

[Verse 1]
She was more like a beauty queen from a movie scene
I said don't mind, but what do you mean I am the one
Who will dance on the floor in the round
She said I am the one, who will dance on the floor in the round
She told me her name was Billie Jean
As she caused a scene
Then every head turned with eyes that dreamed of being the one
Who will dance on the floor in the round

[Bridge]

[Hook]
Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son
She says I am the one, but the kid is not my son

[Verse 2]
For 40 days and for 40 nights
The law was on her side
But who can stand when she's in demand
Her schemes and plans
Cause we danced on the floor in the round
So take my strong advice, just remember to always think twice
Do think twice
(Do think twice)
She told my baby we'd danced 'till three
Then she looked at me
Then showed a photo my baby cried
His eyes looked like mine
Go on dance on the floor in the round, baby

[Bridge 2]
People always told me be careful of what you do
And don't go around breaking young girls' hearts
And mother always told me be careful of who you love
And be careful of what you do cause the lie becomes the truth
Hey

[Hook]

(Uh uh, yeah yeah yeah, number one)

Billie Jean is not my lover
Billie Jean is not my lover
Billie Jean is not my lover
Billie Jean is not my lover
Billie Jean... Billie Jean...
Billie Jean is not my lover
Billie Jean is not my lover
Billie Jean...
