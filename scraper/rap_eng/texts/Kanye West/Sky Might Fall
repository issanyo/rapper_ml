[Intro]
Oh
Oh, oh

[Verse 1]
What a world that I'm living in
Will the rainstorms ever end?
Still I feel my
Path narrow, I run again
Seem happiness is gone again
And then you see 'em
Grey clouds up above man
Metaphor to my life man
Still I feel my
Heart stronger than it's ever been
Strong will 'til my journey ends
Until then I roll
More than I ever rolled
Not pills, but the Mary though
Still I feel my
Eyes heavy when the day goes
Nothing helping when my head doze
But I ain't sleep
Awake in another state
Living in a new space
Still I feel my
Mind running at a steady pace
God help me so I'll win the race
Until then I go

[Hook]
The sky might fall
The sky might fall
But I'm not worried at all
C'mon, c'mon
The sky might fall
The sky might fall
But I'm not worried at all

[Bridge]
Hey, hey
I let 'em know somethin'
I let 'em know somethin'
I let 'em know somethin'
You can listen up, listen up, listen up, listen up
Hey, I let 'em know somethin'
I let 'em know somethin'
I let 'em know somethin'
You can listen up, listen up, listen up, listen up

[Verse 2]
Grey clouds stuck together, fam
Lightning piercing through another land
Over the desert where the lost play
Soul searching each and every way
And then you see the
Awesome sound, so profound
When it â€“ it'll grip you
You can see it
If you hear it you can feel it too
Something special I am running to
Until then I go
Away, very far away
To another universe
Where all the people say
It's the new-new place
For the special to embrace
Like a Martian who seemingly
Wandered out of place
Take what you need
From the valley of the hope, where
Even if you drown
You'll be floating higher up, and
You can say bye, bye, bye
Sky might be falling
But remember you can fly, high

[Hook]
The sky might fall
The sky might fall
But I'm not worried at all
C'mon, c'mon
The sky might fall
The sky might fall
But I'm not worried at all

[Bridge]
Hey, hey
I let 'em know somethin'
I let 'em know somethin'
I let 'em know somethin'
You can listen up, listen up, listen up, listen up
Hey, I let 'em know somethin'
I let 'em know somethin'
I let 'em know somethin'
You can listen up, listen up, listen up, listen up

[Outro]
I keep running, yeah
I gotta keep up, I gotta keep up, yeah
Gotta keep up, I gotta keep up
And I keep running, yeah
I gotta keep up, I gotta keep up, yeah
Gotta keep up, I gotta keep up, yeah
'Cause I'm gone
Yeah, na-na na-na, na-na na-na
I'm up, and away
Na-na, na-na
Know what I'm talkin' 'bout?
Hey, hey
