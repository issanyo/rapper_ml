[Intro: Kanye West & Young Thug]
High lights
Tell my baby I'm back in town
High lights
Tell everybody I'm back in town
High lights
Tell my baby I'm back in town
High lights

[Hook: Kanye West & Young Thug]
We only makin' the highlights
Tell my mama, tell my mama, that I only want my whole life to only be highlights
We only makin' the highlights
Tell my mama, tell my mama, that I only want my whole life to only be highlights

[Post-Hook: TWF Tony Williams]
I wanna play with you all night long
Then after tonight

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Can we play that back one time?
And after that night I'm gon' wanna play this shit back, I don't know
Sometimes I'm wishin' that my dick had GoPro
So I could play that shit back in slo-mo
I just shot an amateur video; I think I should go pro

[Hook: Kanye West & Young Thug]
We only makin' the highlights (slow motion, slow motion)
We only makin' the highlights (slow motion, slow motion)
Tell my mama, tell my mama, that I only want my whole life to be only be highlights

[Post-Hook: TWF Tony Williams]
I wanna play with you all night long
Then after tonight (slow motion)

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
I bet me and Ray J would be friends
If we ain't love the same bitch
Yeah, he might have hit it first
Only problem is I'm rich

[Interlude: Carole King & Kanye West]
You've got to get up every morning
You've got to get up every morning
I live my life on the highlights
You've got to get up every morning
With a smile on your face
And show the world that you've got love in your heart
Oh no, gotta play this shit back

[Verse 3: Kanye West]
And eventually there's gon' be so many niggas
[?] pool party on the weekend, that's the business
There's one white girl told me she hate white cock
That's when I knew hip hop was the new rock
When you know you gotta keep your business zip-loc'd
Cause the nigga still got her Gucci flip-flops
[?] take her on a c-cold adventure
Old bitches know I put the dick on they dentures
Might tell 'em Lexington Steele is my mentor
Famous people act so damn pretentious, huh?
What she need is an hour of some inches, huh?
Got a thick dick hopping on some trenches, huh?
Got the Fruit of Islam in the trenches. huh?
Even though they know Yeezus is a Christian, huh?
She spent a whole check on some Christians, huh?
And that bitch ain't even religious, huh?
I'm respected, I'm way too prestigious
Y'all motherfuckers throwing bows like Riddick
Crack coke, crack sale, white niggas got mail
Might drop a baby line and call that shit Pastel
Walkin', livin', breathin', god, you know my past well
Hard to believe in God, your nigga got killed
Bad bitches fuckin' Rob, though he overweight
I wish my trainer would, tell me what I overate
So when I'm on vacay, I need to kick back
Hah, huh, what you want?
Want a boss or an R&B nigga with a six pack?
I need every bad bitch up in Equinox
I need to know right now if you a freak or not
I need every bad bitch up in Equinox
I need to know right now if you a freak or not
I need every bad bitch up in Equinox
I need to know right now if you a freak or not
I need every bad bitch up in Equinox
I need to know right now if you a freak or not

[Sample: Jen Selter]
(I love social media, I love fitness and I love photography)

[Verse 4: Kanye West]
I need at least seven days with Chloe Sevigny
Since I saw Brown Bunny, it ain't never been the same
I ain't gon' tell ya that I've never been a lame, but
Ever since with Hov, I got that Roc-A-Fella chain
Man, shit just changed, shit just changed
My nigga Dame said let's get this change
Get this thing, iPhone thing
[?] then I hit

[Hook: Kanye West & Young Thug]
We only makin' the highlights (slow motion, slow motion)
We only makin' the highlights (slow motion, slow motion)
Tell my mama, tell my mama, that I only want my whole life to be only be highlights

[Post-Hook: TWF Tony Williams]
I want to play with you all night long
Then after the night
I want to play with you all night long
Then after the night

[Hook: Kanye West & Young Thug]
We only makin' the highlights
Tell my mama, tell my mama, that I only want my whole life to be only be highlights
