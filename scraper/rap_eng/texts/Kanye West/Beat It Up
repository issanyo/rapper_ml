[Intro]
You know you got me fucked up
I don't wanna, I don't wanna, I don't wanna touch nobody else
Physically I'm so, so into you
Daydream about us, even when I'm by myself, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
I know that we're not together girl but I know everything about your body
Girl you love it when I take my time and dive in
Makes it better cause you know we only close friends
Spread them legs, I'mma give it to ya all night, all night, all night, I'mma have you screaming

[Chorus]
Call when you need it cause you know I beat it up
You know I beat it up
Call when you need it cause you know I beat it up
Girl I'mma come through, I'mma put it down on you
I'mma beat it up, you know I beat it up
Call when you need it cause you know I beat it up
Girl I'mma come through, I'mma put it down on you
I'mma beat it up

[Verse 2]
Catching feelings
I don't wanna, I don't wanna, I don't wanna mess things up between us
But I love them feelings
You give me when I'm wrapped up in your love

[Pre-Chorus]
I know that we're not together girl but I know everything about your body
Girl you love it when I take my tongue and dive in
Makes it better cause you know we only close friends
Spread them legs, I'mma give it to ya all night, all night, all night, I'mma have you screaming

[Chorus]
Call when you need it cause you know I beat it up
You know I beat it up
Call when you need it cause you know I beat it up
Girl I'mma come through, I'mma put it down on you
I'mma beat it up, you know I beat it up
Call when you need it cause you know I beat it up
Girl I'mma come through, I'mma put it down on you
I'mma beat it up

[Bridge]
Oh I'mma beat, I'mma beat it up girl
Girl, yeah, yeah, oh

[Pre-Chorus]
I know that we're not together girl but I know everything about your body
Girl you love it when I take my tongue and dive in
Makes it better cause you know we only close friends
Spread them legs, I'mma give it to ya all night, all night, I'mma have you screaming

[Chorus]
Call when you need it cause you know I beat it up
You know I beat it up
Call when you need it cause you know I beat it up
