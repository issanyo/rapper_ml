[Chorus: Kanye West, Teyana Taylor & The Younghearts]
We got love, love, love
You better believe it (Love, love)
Said we got love, love, love
You better believe it (Love, love)

[Verse 1: Teyana Taylor & Kanye West]
I got house and a carriage, yeah
I got Black love and marriage, yeah
They gon' say you can’t have it, but
I might go kill the messenger
We gon' kill the stigma up
Huxtables turned to Obamas
It ain't about where you been, where you from
What you got
It’s all about love
Self-love is the best love (Love)
When you gon' take that wristband off? (Off)
That pity party been over (Been over)
Don't need make-up to dress you up (Dress you up)
I gave birth on the bathroom floor (Bathroom floor)
Just me, Iman, and headphone cords
Don't let this life defeat you
I hope this message reach you

[Refrain: Teyana Taylor & Kanye West]
Throw your hands up
Play catch with the hundreds
Love is the new money
I'm just chillin' with the homies
Home is where the heart is
Throw your hands up
Play catch with the hundreds
Love is the new money
I'm just chillin' with the homies
Home is where the heart is
Throw your hands up

[Chorus: Kanye West, Teyana Taylor & The Younghearts]
We got love, love, love
You better believe it (Love, love)
We got love, love, love
You better believe it (Love, love)

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
I live in abundance, love is the new money
I’m mentally wealthy, spiritually conscious
I’m fresh out of Onyx, I'm ballin’, I'm ballin'
I play with the hunnids, love is the new money
That's my frequency, stock up, burn the sage
Clear the room, heal the hate, love is the new wave

[Refrain: Kanye West & Teyana Taylor]
Love is the new money, love is the new money
I’m just chillin' with the homies, home is where the heart is (Ahh!)
...play catch with the
Love is the new money
I'm just chillin' with the homies, home is where the heart is (Ahh!)

[Chorus: Kanye West, Teyana Taylor & The Younghearts]
We got love, love, love
You better believe it (Love, love)
We got love, love, love
You better believe it (Sing it, love, love)

[Refrain: Kanye West & Teyana Taylor]
Play catch with the hundreds
Love is the new money
I'm just chillin' with the homies
Home is where the heart is (Ah!)
Play catch with the hundreds
Love is the new money
I'm just chillin' with the homies
Home is where the heart is

[Outro: Lauryn Hill]
Above all you keep your clarity
You keep your focus
You keep your sense of love
And you keep your sense of purpose
Those are, they're integral
You know, they're key
Happiness
You know, um a lot of people define success differently
You know for me
You can have everything
You could have all the money in the world
But if its not enjoyable, if its not sustainable, you know
If you can't be a person of integrity while having all these things
What does it matter?
What does it mean?
The value is internal
Your value is internal
