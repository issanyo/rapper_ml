[Sugar J]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yo
Check me out, yo
This is J 'Sug', yo
I know you been around the world, man
I don't fuck wit' the sheisty niggas
I don't fuck wit' the sheisty hoes
I done did it all, nigga

[Loon]
Yo, what would make a scared man pull a trigga'?
The same thing that make a scared man act bigga'
The same thing that make me grab my tec and empty quicker
Adrenaline rush, on the hush
You will die fuckin' wit' us
Vacant lot is my home and In my team I trust
So don't talk about them things if yo' things don't bust
I knew a guy like you, his name was Filipe
Had me on 3-way with the D.A
Tryin' to find out where we stay
So on my 24th b-day I'm locked up in V.A
He don't know my guns turn commotion to slow motion
Then from slow motion to no motion
Run up in the place he hip hoppin'
Spit shots in, clip droppin', if I get caught, get Cochran
And give Pedro my pesos so he don't snitch while I lay low
For 'bout a week or two
Come back like peek-a-boo, you see me, I see you
And if you talk, you be in ICU

[Cardan]
Yo, yo, this Cardan
I know you know a hundred brotha's that sheisty
Like I know a hundred brotha's that's real
But I think it's time you know how we chill

[Meeno]
1 - I have been a hundred places and nothin' excites me
Hit a hundred ho's and none of them wifey
For every thousand that love me
A hundred don't like me
So how you wit' a hundred cats and none of the sheisty?

[Drag-On]
We the niggas wit' the homicides
And got niggas the most traumatized
And how they actually sat there and watched they mama die
But don't worry about it, you second
Just had to get her first
Cuz she was the one that gave birth
And we can't have no more dirt in the earth
I hate to be the last nigga to turn off your lights
Without usin' a switch, and throw you in a ditch
Ya body don't fit, cuz niggas could still see ya kicks
So do you really wanna take that risk?
So unball ya fists cuz I'm always a step ahead of ya'll
You ball ya fists, I cock back
You take a swing and you got that
And that's what they gon' mop at
This gun is from a foreign land
I don't know why it got it in my hand
And I'm gonna get off every penny
I don't care if its automatic or semi
If I payed 300 flat, that means I'mma send a hundred cats back
If 300 attack, but it don't hafta be an exact
I'm gonna get the gatts and get 'em all in one house, and run out
And sprinkle some on the grass, and spit on it
And come back to a pile of ash

Repeat 1

[Meeno]
Yo, yo, yo, a hundred sheisty, a hundred and quicker
We strap up inside the 18-wheeler
A drug dealer with cold cash, but so as
To get his stash would be no task with no mess
Love to get you hot and blast, than fast
My infared beam is on yo' ass, my team is on yo' ass
Plot and schemin' on yo' ass
That bitch you came wit' stay screamin' on her ass
Put three on her ass cuz nigga, we love the cash
Harlem World niggas got G's in the stash
No questions asked, time will tell, Heaven or hell
You don't wanna be the nigga who be catchin' the shell
Meeno, and then I be, be the team to prevail
So when you pray, tell Jesus how you wanna be helped
MuthaFucka!!!!

Rock-a-bye baby [repeated til end]

Repeat 1 until fade
