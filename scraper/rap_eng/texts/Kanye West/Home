Go ahead roll it up and pass it round
Cause lately's been a whole lot of bullshit going down
A lot of soldiers ain't make it through this year
So lets just celebrate that we still here and
Oh, never leave me alone
Tell em holla at ya boy, and cause I'll be comin home
I'll be comin home, oh, never leave me alone
Tell em holla at ya boyyy and cause I'll be comin home
I'll be coming home

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
My homie called me like what up man
Not from Florida but what up fam
It's been a whole lot of hatin' again
And if they hatin' on me damn what up then
I met this girl when I was 3 years old
And what I loved most she had so much soul
She said "Excuse me little homey, I know you don't know me
But, my name is Windy and I like to blow trees"
And from that point I never blow her off
Niggas come from out of town, I like to show her off
They like to act tough, she like to tow 'em off
And make 'em straighten up they hat 'cos she know they soft
And when I grew up she showed me how to go downtown
In the nighttime, her face lit up, so astoundin'
I told her in my heart is where she'll always be
She never mess with entertainers cause they always leave
She said "It felt like they walked and drove on me
Knew I was gang affiliated, got on TV and told on me"
I guess that's why last winter she got so cold on me
She said "'Ye, keep making that platinum and gold for me!"
But if you really cared for her
Then yiy woulda never hit the airport and followed ya dreams
Sometimes I still talk to her, but when I talk to her
It always seem like she talkin bout me
She said, "You left ya kids, and they just like you
They wanna rap and make soul beats just like you
But they just not you, and I just got through
Talkin bout, what niggas tryin to do, just not new"
Now everybody got the game figured out all wrong
I guess you never know what you got till it's gone
I guess that's why I'm here and I can't come back home
And guess when I heard that? When I was back home
In the interviews I'm representin you makin you proud
Shoot for the stars so if you fall you land on the clouds
Jump in the crowds, spark ya lighters and wave 'em around
If you don't know by now, I'm talkin about Chi-Town
