If you ever see somebody next to me, know that they're better than me at something

So -- bars. Bars

So it's really good to have this event tonight which we decided instantaneously, the way we put this shit together, y'all comin' out here tonight vibin' with us. In the way this whole albums put together. The amount of producers that came together for it and the way we worked on this shit really collectively, collaboratively. We didn't give a fuck about what nobody else said outside lookin' in, anything. We just wanted to make the best product possible. And this is just the beginning of an entirely new mentality of how to make music directed for the people. What I said last night is like, we drop this shit June 18th. This ain't about waitin' until August and havin' some big this and that. It's about deliverin' some shit for y'all to go to work to, ride to, listen to while y'all workin' out and shit. Whatever y'all doin' to provide a soundtrack for this shit that's gon' come out. We gon' keep on doin' this shit over and over and over. Makin' shit for my core, my cut

With the creative director Matt Williams and Virgil Abloh, the whole team, Don C, Ibn, all the Been Trill family, and the combination of all the people we brought together from Daft Punk workin' like 3-4 joints on the album. The first joint "Onsite", "I Am A God", bless me, and Mike Dean. Travis Scott workin' on the album, Hudson Mohawke, Arca. And of course, at the end, last -- wait a second, am I forgettin' some people and shit?

Last, but not last, that came and helped bring this whole shit together, the executive producer of this LP and the family, is Rick Rubin comin' in and finishing up the whole shit for us. Which is legendary because everything we did on this project, everything I get like when we release 'Numbers on the Boards", from the video to the "NO ARTWORK" to the sound of the song and everything. I was like, "What would Rick Rubin do? What was his Def Jam shit that they were doing?" Because I remember like Ricky would say, "When we did Def Jam, we wasn't really feelin' like we was in competition with nobody, cause this shit was so direct." Where we at right now? We in the middle of the city right now, over into the motherfuckin' streets and nobody shuttin' down shit while we makin' real music and yall vibin out to this shit.. So it's good for me to go to the God, Rick Rubin, and play him my shit. Ask him questions and allow him to take this project to an entirely new level and he made a lot of great decisions at the end and brought it to a whole new level. And I wanted to explain something about the title Yeezus

Simply put: West was my slave name and Yeezus is my god name
