[Verse One: DJ Class]
I got them diamonds on my neck, got Patron in my cup
If you want it come and get it shorty I don't give a fuck
See it's friday night, and I just got paid
I done had a hard week, now it's time to celebrate
Tell the DJ play my shit, on that club music shit
Them girls wanna freak, back it all up on my dick
See it's on tonight, tryin to leave with somethin' right
I'm a grown ass man, so shorty you can spend the night

'Ye is in the buliding, let everybody know
I got the world in my hand and I ain't finna let it go
Is that yo' girlfriend? I really like her
I'm talkin' only for a night, I wouldn't wife her
I got them Yeezy's on my feet, I got them Louie's in the sto' (Want some?)
And I dropped another album, 'fore we finished up the tour
And it's still top 10, 'bout fifteen weeks later
So that's a middle finger for you 808 haters
