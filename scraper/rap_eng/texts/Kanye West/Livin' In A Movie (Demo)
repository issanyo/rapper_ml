[Intro: Kanye West]
Um, I'd like to introduce myself
Coming to a theater near you this summer or, really, like right now
Oh
It's Kanye, to the
I used to live in the movies, you know
So uh, get your popcorn, get your condiments
Turn your cellphones off, you don't wanna miss nothing

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
I had to stab big nigga, tryna sell me a lick
He said "Analyze this, this as good as it gets"
Now don't be bedazzled by the purple haze
It ain't gon be the color of *Purple Rain*
I told him
Just break it off, light it up, set it off man
How hot? Better make Eddie cough, man
And them shrooms'll have a man on the moon
Cookin up flow in the boiler room
I want DMX style of run, exit wound
I want the X-Men around me, Malcolm X could use
Like no one man should have all that power
Get all that powder in 48 hours
And he stick the kingpin. or king of New York
They probably just queens of comedy
If you in my things, you *Suicide Kings*
There's only *Three Kings*, *Me, Myself and Irene*

[Chorus: Kanye West]
And I'm livin' the movies, not livin by rules
It's just a movie, don't lose your cool
I'm livin the movies, not livin by rules
It's just a movie, don't lose your cool
Sit back and enjoy the show

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
They call me *Edward Scissorhands* cause I'm trying to cut
She claim she got cramps, I'm gon' get you to suck
And you not gon' use your teeth, you hear?
You gon' find out *What Lies Beneath* right here
*The Preacher's Wife* don't give head, get a divorce, man
*The Kids* been calling you the headless horseman
Like *Sleepy Hollow*, see she swallow
Suck like ol' girl, got booed at *Apollo 13*, *Ghosts*
Use my *Hollow Man* for *Friday 13th*
You be *Ghost*, *Backdraft* from the toast
Niggas who drop names is oh so shameless
Get a chain that's stainless, now they *Almost Famous*
My bling got 'em calling me *Lord of the Rings*
*The Shining* make it hard for her to *Do The Right Thing*
But *I Don't Say a Word*, I'll never tell
Until you get a Kanye beat, you'll never sell

[Chorus: Kanye West]
And I'm livin' the movies, not livin by rules
It's just a movie, don't lose your cool
I'm livin the movies, not livin by rules
It's just a movie, don't lose your cool
Sit back and enjoy the show

[Verse 3: Kanye West]
I know *Something About Mary* (mm-hmm)
*I Know What You Did Last Summer* before Sally met Harry
Back when I was sprung on *Carrie*
Must've been on some *Shallow Hal*
Cause she was definitely wasn't no Halle Barry
I guess I did it for the *Glory*
Now the players love that *Neverending Story*
My Christian story, shorty
Talked about my outfit, but they quit
Cause I'll shoot your eye out, kid
Don't forget
My school days back in *Cooley High*
I wasn't trippin, just foolish, just crusin by
Yo Gerard, Dr. Nichols in the hospital
Yo, I was out to prove that it was possible
And why your *Bodyguard* come home like Kevin Costner do
I love men who can pimp her, like a prostitute
I tell her this relationship is like the 1st rule of *Fight Club*-
Don't talk about *Fight Club*

[Chorus: Kanye West]
And I'm livin' the movies, not livin by rules
It's just a movie, don't lose your cool
I'm livin the movies, not livin by rules
It's just a movie, don't lose your cool
Sit back and enjoy the show
