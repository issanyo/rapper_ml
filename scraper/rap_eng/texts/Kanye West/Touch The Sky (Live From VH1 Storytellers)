Let's have some fun now
Get up and touch it
Get up and touch the sky, come on [7x]

[Bridge]
I gotta testify
Come up in the spot lookin' extra fly
Before the day I die, I'mma touch the sky
Testify
I'm up in the spot lookin' extra fly
'Fore the day I die, I'mma touch the sky

[Verse 1 - Kanye West]
Back when they thought pink Polos would hurt the Roc
Before Cam got them hits to pop
The doors was closed, I felt like Bad Boy's street team
I couldn't work the locks
Now let's go, take 'em back to the plan
Me and my momma hopped in that U-Haul van
Any pessimists I ain't talk to them
Plus I ain't have no phone in my apart-a-ment
Take 'em back to the club
Least about an hour I stand on line
I just wanted to dance, I went to Jacob an hour
After I got my advance, I just wanted to shine
Jay favorite line: "Dawg, in due time!"
Now he look at me, like, "Damn, dawg! You where I am!"
A hip-hop legend, I think I died
In a accident, cause this must be heaven

[Bridge]

[Hook]
Now let's take them hi-ah-igh-igh-igh-ighhhh(Top of the world baby)
(Top top of the world)
A-la-la-la-lah-la-lahhhhh(Top of the world baby)
(On top of the world)

[Verse 2 - Kanye West]
Back when Gucci was the hits to rock
Back when Slick Rick had the shit to pop
I'd do anything to say I got it
Damn, them new loafers hurt my pocket
Before anybody wanted K. West beats
Me and my girl split the buffet at KFC
Dog, I was having nervous breakdowns
Like "Man - these niggas that much better than me?"
Baby, I'm going on an airplane
And I don't know if I'll be back again
Sure enough, I sent the plane tickets
But when she came to kick it, things became different
Any girl I cheated on, sheets I skeeted on
Couldn't keep it at home, thought I needed a Nia Long
I'm trying to right my wrongs
But it's funny them same wrongs helped me write this song

[Bridge]

Now say: I'm, I'm sky high

Feels good to be home, feels good to be home

Are y'all happy you came to VH1 Storytellers?

Get up and touch the sky, come on

I am so disappointed, that I cannot see me perform
Except for on playback
My greatest pain in live, is that I'll never see me perform
So you are welcome to know a pleasure, that I will never have

Come on [20x]

This song is what inspired 808's and Heartbreak more than anything
Because we used do this at the end of the tour every night
And I would do it for – how many of you saw the Glow In The Dark tour in the room tonight?
Thank you so much, for coming to the tour

So y’all remember at the end of the show I would do this song
And I would say some inspirational words and I would sing
And I had the opportunity to just kind of do it and play it off
But I discovered that I love to sing
So much and to my thing and harmonize and just go up and down and just fuck around

I really feel like a vessel
And I open my mouth and God will let beautiful words flow through
That’s why I realized that he chose me and he has a path for me
Because half the things that come out, I can’t be responsible for
And I guess he just wants me to say more and more and more and never be insecure and always be sure, be sure
And he will give me the strength I need to endure, for sure
As I tour and bring the pure
So much more, more, for sure
For your entertainment, education and relation
To take away your hesitation and segregation

In a country full of immigrants, where no one really was born here, but separated here
It’s a beautiful thing that in a country that was so divided by the concept of black and white
We now have a black and white president

And this is what the future is to me
The juxtaposition: two things that you think don’t go together

When a black, super-Hip-Hop-dressed dude gets on an elevator and there’s an old lady with Chanel and she grabs her purse
I’ll give you a cliché example
What would happen if they actually talk to each other?
What would she learn? What would he learn?

When the rich man hopping out the Lincoln Town Car, passes by the homeless person
And they actually talk to each other
What would he learn? What would he learn?

If a black man, that came from Chicago and was taught to stand so far away from gay people, ‘cause you do not want to be accused of being gay
Was to talk to a gay person
What would he learn? What did I learn?

I learned that people in Chicago was wrong
And I’ve been an asshole all along
A lot of things that you learn are wrong
So don’t be an asshole too long, too long, too long
You can’t be an asshole too long
You can’t be an asshole too long

‘Cause the more you know, the more you grow, the more responsibility you have show what you know
And give everything that you got to give, baby that’s the reason God let me live through the accident without practicing
Okay, got to bring this up and bring it back again
Okay, okay, okay, okay
Alright [7x]
No publishing Outkast, please
Alright [5x]
Shout out to three G’s
One of the few dressed quite as fresh as me
