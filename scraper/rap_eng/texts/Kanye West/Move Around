[Kanye West]
Yo Bump, I just want to make sure everybody knew who did the track
Kanye-to-the, with the GOON SQUAD!

[Hook: Bump J]
Shawty you know the game's
Bout pickin' and choosin'
You don't know when you won
You so used to losin'
Move around now, move around now
Move around now, move around move
I know you see me tryna party homey
Give me that room
Don't make me up this 40 on me
And click ta clack boom!
Move around now, move around now
Move around now, move around move

[Verse 1: Bump J]
I ain't going back to doing a book a day
I'm at this rap full time, my future's lookin' great
Feds not convinced, think I'm still movin' weight
Move around clowns, don't even look my way
Bump's a hustla, got cheddar to check in
For real you would die for whatever you reppin'
You smart, you would carry a weapon
Mines'll make you do a back flip better than Mary Lou Retten
I'll shoot somethin' up, I'm from grimeyville
You know it's shoes on that truck if I'm behind the wheel
They know me and so I got it locked I remind them still
Cause every line that I put up in a rhyme is real
And you wonder why the label shoot you down
Your album will never leave the shelf cause you's a clown
Look at me, flickin' somethin' serious through the town
You rap niggas couldn't be serious, move around now

[Hook: Bump J]
Shawty you know the game's
Bout pickin' and choosin'
You don't know when you won
You so used to losin'
Move around now, move around now
Move around now, move around move
I know you see me tryna party homey
Give me that room
Don't make me up this 40 on me
And click ta clack boom!
Move around now, move around now
Move around now, move around move

[Verse 2: Bump J]
See there, it ain't poppin' 'less we there
Your barkin' better stop before I hit you with the three squared
That's a nine if you failed math, I bail pass in that pale Jag
Cause I push weight and you sell bags
Come and cop that from me
My [diesel?] have cluckers noddin off like they ain't slept in weeks
Whoever disrespect the chief
I'll have the Tec put you pets to sleep
That's all you birds I catch singing to detects police
You ain't my dogs, you rats and you cats can rest in peace
I post up on a deck for weeks
You can ask K-West, I'm a masterpiece!
I got a good name, and I spit good game
Tried ya baby mama out, and she got good brains
I look lames in the face and tell 'em
You ain't a Goon, you's a fruit, I'm a gansta mella

[Hook: Bump J]
Shawty you know the game's
Bout pickin' and choosin'
You don't know when you won
You so used to losin'
Move around now, move around now
Move around now, move around move
I know you see me tryna party homey
Give me that room
Don't make me up this 40 on me
And click ta clack boom!
Move around now, move around now
Move around now, move around move

[Verse 3: Bump J]
Look, I got a crazy flow so while you hatin' Joe
I'm off in Mejico posin', frozen H20
Around my neck and wrists, a couple ladies so
If I was to go tonight, it's all gravy Joe
Went from the US to USSR
In the best private jets nigga, you just test cars
But when I am on my land, I'm stylin'
My rims chop like the karate man from Shaolin
And the Goons hit the club, and pile in
We in these streets wildin', chumps where ya'll been?
We move around, I'm off on the islands sipping daiquiris
See why you niggas so mad at me
I'm enjoying the rewards of this hip hop
On the West Coast in my tank top and flip flops
Smoking something you can smell through the zip lock
Never find another nigga this hot, no

[Hook: Bump J]
Shawty you know the game's
Bout pickin' and choosin'
You don't know when you won
You so used to losin'
Move around now, move around now
Move around now, move around move
I know you see me tryna party homey
Give me that room
Don't make me up this 40 on me
And click ta clack boom!
Move around now, move around now
Move around now, move around move
