[Intro]
Man Mel, G
I gotta pour my heart out on this track you made
It just made me feel like I had to say something
Like what I'm going through right now
I'm Kanye-to-the and the Roc is in the building right now
Feel me on this

[Hook]
Oh, oh
Let me call some, call some girls that I know, know
I don't mean the bougie ones from before, 'fore
I need some girls that's really down to get low, low (to the wall)

[Verse 1]
Now if my man Benzino got a Benz and they call him Benzino
When I get my Bentley, they gon' call me Bentlino
A lot of shit changed since I hooked with Jay-Z, yo
For the tracks, charge around 800 C-notes
So glad I ain't take the job at Home Depot
Right now my car and home would be repo'd
I broke up with my girl today around 3-0
My man said, "Let's call some girls that we know"
Sometimes I wanna say, "Fuck my bitch"
But I don't want nobody to fuck my bitch
Even if a modelin' chick sucked my dick
It wouldn't make me not feel so sick
Just because, they came over to cheer me up
Smoked, drank, and yeah we fucked
But nothin' that they did could've been enough

[Hook]
Oh, oh
Let me call some, call some girls that I know, know
I don't mean the bougie ones from before, 'fore
I need some girls that's really down to get low, low (to the wall)
Oh, oh
I'ma need to take a hit of that dro
I'ma smoke l never smoked before
And bring some girls that's really down to get low (to the wall)

[Verse 2]
Now this weed, drank got me faded
That Malibu is so underrated
She mad at me, that's an understatement
I can just see your girlfriends hatin'
Girl, told you don't leave his ass
And when that nigga blow he gon' leave your ass
But when he get low, he gon' need your ass
If he cryin', callin', bawlin'
Y'all've been together too long for all this name callin'
Y'all'll be back together in a day or two
Yeah we be makin' up but when we makin' up
All we're makin' up is the truth
Damn, I know she love me, oh
But I'm in the Matrix and I'm feelin' I'm Neo
She could fight for my love like Aaliyah
Or write a four page letter like Aaliyah
But I'm a Gemini that's bossy like a Leo
And sometimes I don't know what side I'm on
I just know this Patr√≥n got me gone
And I've done fucked up so bad that I can't go home

[Hook]
Oh, oh
Let me call some, call some girls that I know, know
I don't mean the bougie ones from before, 'fore
I need some girls that's really down to get low, low (to the wall)
Oh, oh
I'ma need to take a hit of that dro
I'ma smoke like l never smoked before
And bring some girls that's really down to get low (to the wall)
