Let me tell y’all something. There will never be a Watch the Throne 2. You know why? Because that’s the reason why I wasn’t on the song ["Pop Style"]. I wasn’t on the song because of Hov. Because of some Tidal/Apple bullshit. This shit get me tight every time I perform this motherfucker. Y’all didn’t get what y’all was supposed to get with me and Drake on this song because of some Tidal/Apple bullshit. This shit got me tight. Every time I perform this song I think about the shit. I think about the politics and the bullshit. I think about how hard I go for music, for art, for y’all, for the fans—how hard we go

I started freestyling to it. Jay thought of a couple lines. I said, 'Man, just go ahead and throw that on there. They’ll be so surprised. He probably wouldn’t expect you to be on there.' And [Drake] was like, 'Oh shit, The Throne is on this shit!' Then Jay thought about it and, out of respect for Meek Mill, he ain’t want to be on the track. And I said, 'Look, I’ll call Drake, I’ll call Meek, I’ll call y’all…we gotta let people have this song!' But then it went out of that territory and it went into some Tidal shit, some political shit, some shit about percentages on songs. I can’t take this shit, bro! Our kids ain’t never even played together. Run that shit
