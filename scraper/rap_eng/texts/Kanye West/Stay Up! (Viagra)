(Stay Up)
Stay-
(VIAGRA!!)
Stay up
Stay up (Yeah)
Stay up (Kinda crazy, right?)
Stay up

[Kanye West]
What she got is so Niagara
Make a young nigga straight need Viagra
Make a old nigga give keys to Jaguar
Just to keep from all the tease and laughter
Her telling her homegirls that he couldn't stay up
In the restaurant with her voice way up
Please keep it discreet
Keep the business out of the street
She said "I would if he'll handle biz up in the sheets!"
Pop off like a thang thang, he keep keep
And every time that she bang bang, he skeet skeet
And he so bullheaded tried to three-peat
Try imagining something passionate
Between you, Cassie, and Kim Kardashian
Maybe that'll work when you get to hit that ass again
Or you can grab a Red Bull and sip that twice
Now y'all can have sexy time, it's nice!!

Man this is classic, call her National Geographic
Her ass is African, but her eyes so Asian
Plus the waist and, time's a-wastin'
This some good pussy, dog please don't waste it
You said "Fuck that, man I'm gon' tape it!"
And came before you barely even got the tape in
She had the maid outfit, it's all on her apron
I know a friend who got drunk and claim a fat bitch raped him

[88 Keys]
I heard that bitch hate men and she covers up her crotch
But she love to show her girls like Sanaa Lathan
And she throwing passes like Troy Aikman
And she really into twisting facts like false statements
He's into twisting backs by throwing his weight in
But she ain't waiting for him to rise to the occasion
He's like "Be patient, this a contact sport
So you can save your pep talk, give me that oral support"
And stay up

[Hook] (Kanye West & 88 Keys)
