[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Fresh off the plane, konitchiwa bitches
Turn around another plane, my passport on pivot
As for what I did it, that asshole done did it
Talked it and he lived it, spitted then he shitted
I don't need to write hits, I might bounce ideas
But only I could come up with some shit like this
I done played the underdog my whole career
I've been a very good sport, haven't I, this year

[Verse 2: Jay-Z]
Like a mama you birthed me, Brooklyn you nursed me
Schooled me with hard knocks, better than Burkley
They say you murked me by the time I was 21
That shit disturbed me, but you never hurt me
Hello Brooklyn, if we had a daughter
Guess what I'm a call her, Brooklyn Carter
When I left you for Virginia it didn't offend ya
Cause you know I only stepped out to get dinner

[Verse 3: Ne-Yo]
Ooh it's something about
Just something about the way she moves
I can't figure it out
There's something about her
Say Ooh it's something about
Kinda woman that wants you but don't need you
Hey I can't figure it out
There's something about her
Cause she walk like a boss, talk like a boss
Manicured nails to set the pedicure off
She's fly effortlessly
She move like a boss do what a boss
Do she got me thinking about getting involved
That's the kind of girl I need

[Hook: Ne-Yo]
She got her own thing
That's why I love her
Miss Independent
Won't you come and spend a little time
She got her own thing
That's why I love her
Miss Independent
Ooh the way you shine
Miss Independent

[Verse 4: Lil Wayne]
Ridin' by myself well really not really
So heavy in the trunk make the car pop-a-wheelie
Who? Weezy Baby or call me Young Baby
My money 360, you only 180
Half of the game too lazy
Still sleepin' on me but I'm bout to wake em
Yep! I'm bout to take em to New Orleans and bake em
Yeah it's hot down here take a walk with Satan yeah
Come on mama let The Carter make ya
Toss ya like a fruit salad strawberry-grape ya
They ball when they can and I'm ballin' by nature
Addicted to the game like Jordan and Payton
Ya'll in a race and me I'm at the finish line
They running for too long it's time to gimme mine
Straight down ya chimney in ya living room is I
Weezy allergic to wintertime...
