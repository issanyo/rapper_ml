[Intro: Grav]
Like this
From the realm of the dunzillas
From Chi town to uptown
My man Rashaun, Kanye, Seldom C, Sway
Meet Grav
And spark on this like 4th day 'Raq

[Verse 1: Grav]
Flow's wicked like eurocentrics, magically makin' men emerge
Spiritual urge, that leave from their body to surge to witness my verbs
Leave holes in chest cavities like vaginas black
Finger poppin' souls with facts
Mishaps and missteps, repulsive acts nonstop
We load the clip to keep my mind skills on cock
Against corrupted MCs, splittin' their skulls with one swift motion
Cosmic destruction cause I get high from Merlin's potion

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Yo mad niggas got dreams of the Lexus and coupes
Got their signin' bonus and bought TECs for the video shoot
Ayo them shits backfired before the cameraman arrived, he died
For his image, now let's start the scrimmage
In the first quarter, I sacked 25 MCs
By halftime you still got rhymes but they are diseased
They infected with 75 seconds of life left
I cremate MCs and breathe they ashes in my life's breath
In a life or death situation
I come through with the Chi representation
And bleed you pussies every month like ovulation
The sensation'll shine through your mind
Take it line for line

[Chorus: Grav + Kanye West]
Play across the board to rob these niggas blind
When we're takin' 'em line for line
Yo let's react with our mind, kill the black-on-black crime
I'll be takin' it line for line

[Verse 3: Seldom C]
Yo what you got, nigga?
I got a fix for your binge
Laced dope that soaks nerves numb
Slung in slums to a steady stream of clientele
Eager tongues fold under pressure, the parallel
Doubt disarrays the strongest efforts like a spell
The spell will lift, the truth be even more vague
Infectious on phonograph, a verbal plaque plague
That preys on focused ears, I steer the culture in a new direction
Disarm your psyche before you can reach your Smith & Wesson

[Verse 4: Sway]
I write like a cartel
Melody mercenaries that fits the art well
A secret order of chosen artists summoned from global markets
Plottin' precise assaults on sub-terrainian targets
Citizens seek refuge from bombshed that drops constant
Poetically potent content executed on some calm shit
Yo I heard they said [?] ghettobred, thorough head
That an MC that can't rhyme is better off than said
Best music off rhymes like [?] holdin' 8ths
From a malicious mouth face that makes radioactive space
The science we seek, world supremacy over beats
A league of crowd catalysts unleashed on the streets

[Chorus: Seldom C + Sway]
Why you reachin' for your heat? My shit's concealed in the mind
When I'm takin' 'em line for line
Anonymous masterminds shiftin' a paradigm
When I'm takin' 'em line for line

[Verse 5: Rashaun]
From the cotton fields runaway slaves misbehavin'
My cravings remain eclectic, stay pathetic
Prognosis, verbal dope feign who overdoses
Regain focus, but hold, the pale horse approaches
Roaches, collect the Ls up, my head said it
Plus up the magnetic, I keep shit connected
When crews get beheaded, slave ring the antiseptic
My man Sway erect shit lace it then I bless it
Ayo, uptown heads gravitate toward Saturn
Moon spin me while Seldom C's gone with the wind
On the third day let my mental ascend
Where platinum dicks make your portals do tricks
Dimensional slits trip through space and time
While you black cats remain blind I become sunshine

[Verse 6: Grav]
Risen from tombs
To wreak stress havoc and doom
On flesh and bones of niggas who think microphones
Are restitutes for gods controllin'  the weather
Verbal showers and razor blades rain down to sever
Body parts to expose their inner skin linin'
Death to weak foes from my in depth rhymin'
My timin' is exact and quick to stain brains
From gusts to strong winds and ill hurricanes
Somethin' wicked this way comes
Hey yo in the side of the norm
Niggas'll run take cover from the storm
I cause, when provoked and forced to get loose
With the same lightnin' bolts that I stole from Zeus
It's a holocaust with terror that most niggas fear
Grizzly type style that's rather hard to bear
Forces driven by ancient spirits
That's barefoot with naps, goatees and Chuck spears
Yo, check, as shadow emits from headstones to headphones
Bust eardrums, leave dead tones
In hemispheres of brains used to comprehend
How me and my niggas turned gods to mortal men

[Outro: Rashaun, Grav & Kanye West]
In apocalyptic times I let my third eye shine
When I'm takin' 'em line for line
I take five niggas' souls and convert 'em into mine
Now we takin' 'em line for line
Take 'em now, take 'em now, take 'em now
Take 'em to the side
Side for side
