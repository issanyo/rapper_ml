According to all known laws
Of aviation


There is no way a bee
Should be able to fly


Its wings are too small to get
Its fat little body off the ground


The bee, of course, flies anyway


Because bees don't care
What humans think is impossible


Yellow, black. Yellow, black
Yellow, black. Yellow, black


Ooh, black and yellow!
Let's shake it up a little


Barry! Breakfast is ready!


Ooming!


Hang on a second


Hello?


- Barry?
- Adam?


- Oan you believe this is happening?
- I can't. I'll pick you up


Looking sharp


Use the stairs. Your father
Paid good money for those


Sorry. I'm excited


Here's the graduate
We're very proud of you, son


A perfect report card, all B's


Very proud


Ma! I got a thing going here


- You got lint on your fuzz
- Ow! That's me!


- Wave to us! We'll be in row 118,000
- Bye!


Barry, I told you
Stop flying in the house!


- Hey, Adam
- Hey, Barry


- Is that fuzz gel?
- A little. Special day, graduation


Never thought I'd make it


Three days grade school
Three days high school


Those were awkward


Three days college. I'm glad I took
A day and hitchhiked around the hive


You did come back different


- Hi, Barry
- Artie, growing a mustache? Looks good


- Hear about Frankie?
- Yeah


- You going to the funeral?
- No, I'm not going


Everybody knows
Sting someone, you die


Don't waste it on a squirrel
Such a hothead


I guess he could have
Just gotten out of the way


I love this incorporating
An amusement park into our day


That's why we don't need vacations


Boy, quite a bit of pomp...
Under the circumstances


- Well, Adam, today we are men
- We are!


- Bee-men
- Amen!


Hallelujah!


Students, faculty, distinguished bees


Please welcome Dean Buzzwell


Welcome, New Hive Oity
Graduating class of...


...9:15


That concludes our ceremonies


And begins your career
At Honex Industries!


Will we pick ourjob today?


I heard it's just orientation


Heads up! Here we go


Keep your hands and antennas
Inside the tram at all times


- Wonder what it'll be like?
- A little scary


Welcome to Honex
A division of Honesco


And a part of the Hexagon Group


This is it!


Wow


Wow


We know that you, as a bee
Have worked your whole life


To get to the point where you
Can work for your whole life


Honey begins when our valiant Pollen
Jocks bring the nectar to the hive


Our top-secret formula


Is automatically color-corrected
Scent-adjusted and bubble-contoured


Into this soothing sweet syrup


With its distinctive
Golden glow you know as...


Honey!


- That girl was hot
- She's my cousin!


- She is?
- Yes, we're all cousins


- Right. You're right
- At Honex, we constantly strive


To improve every aspect
Of bee existence


These bees are stress-testing
A new helmet technology


- What do you think he makes?
- Not enough


Here we have our latest advancement
The Krelman


- What does that do?
- Oatches that little strand of honey


That hangs after you pour it
Saves us millions


Oan anyone work on the Krelman?


Of course. Most bee jobs are
Small ones. But bees know


That every small job
If it's done well, means a lot


But choose carefully


Because you'll stay in the job
You pick for the rest of your life


The same job the rest of your life?
I didn't know that


What's the difference?


You'll be happy to know that bees
As a species, haven't had one day off


In 27 million years


So you'll just work us to death?


We'll sure try


Wow! That blew my mind!


"What's the difference?"
How can you say that?


One job forever?
That's an insane choice to have to make


I'm relieved. Now we only have
To make one decision in life


But, Adam, how could they
Never have told us that?


Why would you question anything?
We're bees


We're the most perfectly
Functioning society on Earth


You ever think maybe things
Work a little too well here?


Like what? Give me one example


I don't know. But you know
What I'm talking about


Please clear the gate
Royal Nectar Force on approach


Wait a second. Oheck it out


- Hey, those are Pollen Jocks!
- Wow


I've never seen them this close


They know what it's like
Outside the hive


Yeah, but some don't come back


- Hey, Jocks!
- Hi, Jocks!


You guys did great!


You're monsters!
You're sky freaks! I love it! I love it!


- I wonder where they were
- I don't know


Their day's not planned


Outside the hive, flying who knows
Where, doing who knows what


You can'tjust decide to be a Pollen
Jock. You have to be bred for that


Right


Look. That's more pollen
Than you and I will see in a lifetime


It's just a status symbol
Bees make too much of it


Perhaps. Unless you're wearing it
And the ladies see you wearing it


Those ladies?
Aren't they our cousins too?


Distant. Distant


Look at these two


- Oouple of Hive Harrys
- Let's have fun with them


It must be dangerous
Being a Pollen Jock


Yeah. Once a bear pinned me
Against a mushroom!


He had a paw on my throat
And with the other, he was slapping me!


- Oh, my!
- I never thought I'd knock him out


What were you doing during this?


Trying to alert the authorities


I can autograph that


A little gusty out there today
Wasn't it, comrades?


Yeah. Gusty


We're hitting a sunflower patch
Six miles from here tomorrow


- Six miles, huh?
- Barry!


A puddle jump for us
But maybe you're not up for it


- Maybe I am
- You are not!


We're going 0900 at J-Gate


What do you think, buzzy-boy?
Are you bee enough?


I might be. It all depends
On what 0900 means


Hey, Honex!


Dad, you surprised me


You decide what you're interested in?


- Well, there's a lot of choices
- But you only get one


Do you ever get bored
Doing the same job every day?


Son, let me tell you about stirring


You grab that stick, and you just
Move it around, and you stir it around


You get yourself into a rhythm
It's a beautiful thing


You know, Dad
The more I think about it


Maybe the honey field
Just isn't right for me


You were thinking of what
Making balloon animals?


That's a bad job
For a guy with a stinger


Janet, your son's not sure
He wants to go into honey!


- Barry, you are so funny sometimes
- I'm not trying to be funny


You're not funny! You're going
Into honey. Our son, the stirrer!


- You're gonna be a stirrer?
- No one's listening to me!


Wait till you see the sticks I have


I could say anything right now
I'm gonna get an ant tattoo!


Let's open some honey and celebrate!
