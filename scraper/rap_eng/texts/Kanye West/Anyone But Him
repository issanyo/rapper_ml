[Verse 1: Mr. Hudson]
Anyone but him
I'd rather hear you'd have the whole football team
Than have to watch his filthy lips on your skin
Anyone but him
Anyone but him
With school boy fists, we can take this outside
But knowing my luck, that fuck would win
Anyone but him

[Chorus: Mr. Hudson]
Who's gonna take you home?
Who's gonna take you home?
Who's gonna take you home?
If it isn't me, if it isn't me, if it

[Verse 2: Mr. Hudson]
Anyone but him
My blood boils as my eyes turn green
Is this the best of the best of the scene?
Anyone but him
Anyone but him
With school boy fists, we can take this outside
But knowing my luck, that fuck would win
Anyone but him

[Chorus: Mr. Hudson]
Who's gonna take you home?
Who's gonna take you home?
Who's gonna take you home?
If it isn't me, if it isn't me, if it

[Verse 3: Mr. Hudson]
Anyone but him
Look past the leather, and the dash, and the rims
And you'll see his whole hustle wears thin
Anyone but him
Anyone but him
He's gonna take what you can't take back
Then he's gone out the door on a whim
Anyone but him

[Chorus: Mr. Hudson]
Who's gonna take you home?
Who's gonna take you home?
Who's gonna take you home?
If it isn't me, if it isn't me, if it isn't me

[Verse 4: Kanye West]
Uh, yeah, yeah
Now once she go black, she ain't never coming back
I'm sorry Mr. H, I thought you already knew that
You will see her on a black street like Chauncey
I'm a bad boy like Sean C
Rock a fella like Shawn C
Keep them Apes with me like Don C
Like Jay, keep Beyonc√©
I'm just talking nonsense
So nonchalantly
See my Mark like Ronsy
Pop my collars like Fonzy
Paparazzi is on me
I see your girl want me, I'm filling up her glass
Feeling on her ass, feeling so upper class
And your boy so fresh, I might even flash cash
So at the end of the night, you ain't even gotta ask

[Chorus: Mr. Hudson & Kanye West]
Who's gonna take you home?
Who's gonna take you home?
Who's gonna take you home?
If it isn't me, if it isn't me, if it isn't me

[Outro: Mr. Hudson & Kanye West]
If it isn't me
Who's gonna take you home?
If it isn't me
Who's gonna take you home?
If it isn't me
If it isn't me
Who's gonna take you home?
If it isn't me
Who's gonna take you home?
If it isn't me
Who's gonna take you home?
If it isn't me, if it isn't me, if it isn't me
