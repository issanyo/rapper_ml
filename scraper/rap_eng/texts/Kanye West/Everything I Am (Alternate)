[Hook]
Here we go again
People talkin' shit, but when shit hit the fan
Everything I'm not made me everything I am
Here we go again
People talkin' shit, but when shit hit the fan
Everything I'm not made me everything I am

[Verse 1]
I'll never be picture perfect Beyonc√©
Be light as Al B. or black as Chauncey
Remember him from Blackstreet?
He was as black as the street was
I never be as laid back as this beat was
I never could see why people'd reach a
Fake ass facade that they couldn't keep up
You see how I creeped up?
You see how I played the big role in Chicago like Queen Latifah?
I'd never rock a mink coat in the summertime like Killa Cam
Or rock some mink boots in the wintertime like will.i.am
Let me know if you feel it, man
Cause everything I'm not made me everything I am

[Hook]
Damn, here we go again
People not sayin' what's not for him
But everything I'm not made me everything I am
Damn, here we go again
People talkin' shit, but when shit hit the fan
Everything I'm not made me everything I am

[Verse 2]
And I'm back to tear it up
Haters, start your engines, I hear 'em gearin' up
People talk so much shit about me at barbershops
They forget to get they hair cut
Okay, fair enough, the streets is flarin' up
Cause they want gun talk or I don't wear enough
Baggy clothes, Reeboks or Adidos
Can they add that he just spazzed out at that show?
So say goodbye to the NAACP award
Goodbye to the India.Arie award
They'd rather give me the Ni-Nigga Please award
But I'll just take the I Got A Lot of Cheese award

[Hook]
Damn, here we go again
People talkin' shit, but when shit hit the fan
Everything I'm not made me everything I am
Damn, here we go again
Everybody talkin', but when it hit the fan
Everything I'm not made me everything I am

[Bridge]
Keep the pianos goin', goin', goin', goin', goin'
And I'll keep flowin', flowin'
I got to keep it goin', goin', goin'
And I'm a keep flowin', flowin'
And I'll keep flowin', flowin'
And I'll keep flowin', flowin', flowin'

[Verse 3]
When I wrote this dope shit, what I noticed was so bogus
A lot of people talk about you when you growin' up
But you got to stay focused
People who was number one in school end up like smokers
People you talk the most about
No doubt, sometimes end up the dopest
Anybody know they can't touch the way I flow
I guess it was the way I run from school to school
And sometimes wasn't treaten cool and broke all the rules
And always ended up in the office like Michael Scott
Now I got rings like Michael got
That's Jordan, let me tell you somethin' more important
You think I wrote this, no, it just comes off the top of my
Whatever topic I
Stop it, I'm probably the best out, Mr. West out
Yo, don't nobody want to bout
I knock people out in the first round. the first down
Hear the touchdown, y'all don't even want to clown
With the red shoes on just to let you know I'm freestylin'
Yes, ill, I'm wilin'
I see you, uh, at the mall to show this is my mornin' flow
So imagine my midnight sight when I ignite lyrically
I just might, everybody just bite
When I wrote this, I was picturin' a little girl in high school
With people pickin' on her, tellin' her what she not
Then she'd grow up to be model, so they'll be hot
And everything she not made her slam it
Everything she not made it everything she am
That's incorrect English, but I'm way too distinguished
Can understand this, I rock the planets
Cameras be candid, on, I was lookin' at my prior image
My wire image, this week has been a bad massage
I need a happy endin', get it?

[Hook]
Damn, damn, here we go again
People talkin' shit, but when the shit hit the fan
Everything I'm not made me everything I am

[Bridge]
And I'm a keep goin', goin', goin'
And I'm a keep flowin', flowin', flowin'
And you just keep goin', goin', goin'
And I'm a keep flowin', flowin', flowin'

[Outro] (x3)
Now when they get hard, I need you to keep goin', goin', goin'
And I'm a keep flowin', flowin', flowin'
And one day you gon' show them, show them, show them
And one day you gon' show them, show them, show them
