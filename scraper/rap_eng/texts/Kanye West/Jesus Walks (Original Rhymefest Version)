[Intro]
I ain't innocent, Jesus walked me to the Grammys
Thank you God, now I can sin again!

[Verse 1]
I had the "Jesus Walks" sample and a dope idea
If K hook it up then this could be the song of the year
So I give my nigga the sample and the joint took off
But the verse that 'Fest did somehow got lost
Somewhere got tossed
Homie, I ain't mad at ya, doin' your thing
Let every man be his own king
With no fear ladies and gents, what you finna hear
"Jesus Walks" Rhymefest verse world premiere

[Hook]
(Jesus walks)
God show me the way cause the Devil trying to break me down
(Jesus walks with me)
And the only thing that I pray is that my feet don't fail me now

[Verse 2]
You know what the Midwest is? Young and restless
Where coppin' that work is your best investment
And none of my niggas gonna answer questions
'Cause none of my niggas know who the feds is
We hustle hard for dollars like we grew up checkless
Pops wasn't around, mom's smokin' the breakfast
Before I sold weed, we was roach infested
The two girls downstairs was both molested
I promise if I ever made it out of this hellhole
I wouldn't sell blows, I would just sell flows
My niggas had Nikes, I had Pro Wings shell toes
Kids knew it was Payless, Footlocker ain't sell those
I got a girl that ain't my girl
That got my baby so she bug me
She ain't even cute so my baby prolly ugly
Man sometimes I feel like God don't love me
Maybe the problem is I don't love me
My granny think I'm crazy, the streets is a virus
Sometimes I just want to rest in peace like Osiris
Wait, rest in peace like Osiris
