[Verse One: Brisco]
I'm from the cocaine era, packs in my stroller
Two beepers and a flip, startech Motorola
Bally silts, Kangol tilts
Stand straight when the boss talkin, hush yo lips
My affiliates contract hits
I let the street declare war when you want that beef
Talk cheap, get money, I was taught to ride
Loyalty came first and we don't switch no sides
I'ma savage on the block, nickel rocks and heroin hopes
I walked the ghetto like them but I was takin' my notes
Certified goon, the locks on standby
I just need a couple real niggas I can stand by (C.M.B.)
A bad bitch with hips and two niggas on the interstate takin' them trips
I'm into carrots like Bugs Bunny, Young Brisco, the New Cash Money

[Verse Two: Lil Wayne]
Reportin' live from the booth
I'm killin' these bitches, Young Wayne Carruth
Untamed and loose, plus drank and juice
I was once a spark, into a flame it grew
I don't complain to you, don't complain to me
Everbody got beef and I just came to eat
I'm in the game for keeps, if you in my lane I beep
I been runnin this shit and I ain't neva sprained my knee
And guess who came home, Ronnie the O.G
He still on paper, nigga we neva free
And for my homie Streets, I'mma twist one up
He can't even hit the kush he gotta piss in the cup
What is this on my wrist, shit is sicker than uggh
Yo Brisco, there ain't a sky bigger than us
What's good, I'm in diamonds is you tippin' or what
I took your bitch and she ain't comin' back to work for a month, Weezy

[Verse Three: Lil Wayne & Brisco]
I'm in the all-red slide spur, sittin' on Asantis
With a bad redbone that look somethin' like Ashanti
OK, light brown, sorta tan medina
With a, light brown thick thing like Trina
Um, you prolly seen us, rippin' the streets up
With no top between us, You're so genius
That's my word, you know I got you, twin
You a real nigga dog, thanks for lettin' me in
Yea, he in the game now and I'm bettin' he win
And I'm the rap landlord just collectin' my rent
I put the house on Lil' Bris, he gonna eat this year
Stop for the real niggas who ain't see this year
Open your eyes, open your eyes Cash Money has a new face
And we gon tie the shit up like a shoelace
And that's me, the young hood messiah
'07 I'mma set the fuckin' hood on fire
