[Intro]
I know that you’ve been waiting such a long time
For me to say to you
Just how I feel about you baby
Pardon, but I need to say to you

[Hook]
Girl I'm nervous, I won't lie
I know that time is passin' you by
So wake up (I want to eff you right now)
Please wake up
Don't want you thinkin' I don't try
But I'll admit there's things that I'm
Afraid of (I want you right now)
Please wake up, girl (I need you right now)

[Verse 1]
Baby, uh, you still sleep?
Can I interrupt your dreams?
Made ya breakfast
Freshly cut roses and a confession
You smellin' all good
I must have spilt a whole bottle of cologne on me
But there's things I've been meanin' to tell you
This ain't easy

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Come on girl, wake up
I bet if I snatch this sheet off your ass
Damn, look at you
Layin' there with nothin' but your womanliness
Look at me makin' a mess
Well I'm gon' eat this french toast right off your booty
Truth is, every time I get ready to talk about real stuff
I can't get past this

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Let me put it like this
I'm like Shaka Zulu, straight up warrior
And you, you're like Nefertiti
Titty, 'Titi, titties
See what I mean?
I'm just sayin' it's not a man's nature to show his vulnerable side
But girl, I love you

[Hook x2]

[Verse 4]
You know you mean the world to me
Just learn to read the signs
You know when I’m grabbin' and squeezin' on that booty
I see us in paradise
That’s not what I meant to say, man
Baby don’t wake up
All this crazy love talk
Girl this ain’t me
I’m out
Hello?
Slowisha, wake up
Hey girl
Girl you should have heard what Tony just told me


You know you need the world to me
Just learn to read the signs
You know when I'm grabbin' and squeezin' on that booty
I see us in paradise
That's not what I meant to say, man
Baby don't wake up
All this crazy love talk
Girl this ain't me
I'm out

[Outro]
Phone dialing/ringing

Hello?
Slowisha, wake up
Hey girl
Girl you should have heard what Tony just told me
