[Verse 1: Carl Thomas]
Now I can't sit here and act like, my girl ain't...
Never did nothin' for me
No
But right now she's just not the same...
Woman she used to be
And I tried to explain how I feel
But she just don't know what it takes
No, no
So I'mma take whatever time that I have...
And give it to you

[Chorus]
(Cause my baby don't love me)
The way that you do
Takin' time hangin' out, bangin' out
Gotta give it to you
(Cause my baby don't love me)
The way that you do
So from now on
My love is for you

[Verse 2: Carl Thomas]
Now I ain't gonna sit and complain how she never would cook or clean
Never would cook or clean
Oh, no
If it wasn't for Christmas or my Birthday
She never bought me a thing
Never bought me a thing
But she had the nerve to turn around and ask me for a ring
No, but instead I might just turn it around and give it to you

[Verse 3: Kanye West]
Ever since I been flossin'
My girls totally awesome
Girls wait to exhale
They don't breathe often
Claim that my game stone cold, Steve Austin
Claim that I boss 'em
Basically Diana Ross 'em
But who's to blame for all these fights
When you ain't always wrong
I'm just always right
And I just always like
To see exactly how your face look
Right when I walk down that hallway right
When I pack my bags
When I got that cab
You never thought Kanye would ever got that mad
You acting like I ain't the reason that you got that Jag
That you got that bag
Let's talk about amnesia
Yeah you got that bad
Kanye the best dressed nigga next to fags
And I'm the best version of Mase next to Fab
And I'mma call your best friend up just to stab
Cause of the way that you do
