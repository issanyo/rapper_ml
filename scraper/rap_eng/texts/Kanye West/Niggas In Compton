[Hook]
I said I Blood so hard red cross can't find me
First niggas gotta find me
Who started this gangtsa shit? Motherfucka please remind meÂ 

[Verse 1]
Blood so hard everything red
Niggas Blood more than me this shit weird
Light the tree come on T.V
Niggas throwing up signs like Paul pierce
Blood so hard I forever bleed
Join a gang out here you can never leave
When the album drop, I'm the new PAC
My bitch wanted me to get a nose ring
Blood so hard nigga nose bleed
Why you motherfuckas sittin in the nosebleed?
I'm on my twitter dm'in hoes
Why you motherfuckas bein so nosy?
How could you fall for that fakeout believing that media takeout
Talkin bout how I ate the box bitch you can't even get takeout
One beef nigga meet me at the steakhouse
Come alone nigga this ain't no stakeout
No cops in here just Glocks in here
This shit will blow your face out
Niggas be all up on myspace put the hammer on your Facebook
I come around upside down frown show a nigga how that k look
Come around lay it down nigga jay showed you
And jay told you
And jay showed you

[Hook]
