[Chorus]
N- n- now th- that that don't kill me
Can only make me stronger
I need you to hurry up now
Cause I can't wait much longer
I know I got to be right now
Cause I can't get much wronger
Man I've been waitin' all night now
That's how long I've been on ya

[Bridge]
I need you right now
I need you right now

[Verse 1]
Lets get lost tonight
You could be my black Kate Moss tonight
Play secretary I'm the boss tonight
And you don't give a damn what they all say right?
Awesome
The christian in Christian Dior
Damn they don't make 'em like this anymore
I ask, cause I'm not sure
Is anybody out there anymore?
Bow in the presence of greatness
Cause right now thou has forsaken us
You should be honored by my lateness
That I would even show up to this fakeness
So go ahead go nuts go apeish
'Specially on my best stand on my bapeness
Act like you can't tell who made this
New gospel homey take six, and take this, haters

[Chorus]
N- n- now th- that don't kill me
Can only make me stronger
I need you to hurry up now
Cause it can't get much longer
I know I got to be right now
Cause I can't get much wronger
Man I've been waitin' all night now
That's how long I've been on ya

[Bridge]
I need you right now
I need you right now

[Verse 2]
I don't know if you got a man or not
If you made plans or not
God put me in the plans or not
I'm trippin' this drink got me sayin' a lot
But I know that god put you in front of me
So how the hell could you front on me
There's a thousand you's there's only one of me
I'm trippin' I'm caught up in the moment right?
This is Louis Vuitton dime night
So we gon' do everything that 'J' like
Heard they'd do anything for a klondike
Well I'd do anything for a blonde-dyke
And we'll do anything for the limelight
And we'll do anything when the time's right
Baby you're makin' it
Harder, better, faster, stronger

[Chorus]
N- n- now th- that don't kill me
Can only make me stronger
I need you to hurry up now
Cause I can't wait much longer
I know I got to be right now
Cause I can't get much wronger
Man I've been waitin' all night now
That's how long I've been on ya

[Bridge]
I need you right now
I need you right now
I need you right now
I need you right now

[Outro]
Don't act like I never told you
Don't act like I never told you
Don't act like I never told you
Don't act like I never told you
Don't act like I never told you
Don't act like I never told you
Don't act like I never told you
Don't act like I never told you
