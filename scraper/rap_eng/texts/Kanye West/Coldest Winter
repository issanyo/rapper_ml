[Verse 1]
On lonely nights, I start to fade
On lonely nights, I start to fade
Her love's a thousand miles away
Her love's a thousand miles away

[Hook]
Memories made in the coldest winter
Goodbye my friend, will I ever love again?
Memories made in the coldest winter

[Verse 2]
It's 4 a.m. and I can't sleep
It's 4 a.m. and I can't sleep
Her love is all that I can see
Her love is all that I can see

[Hook]
Memories made in the coldest winter
Goodbye my friend, will I ever love again?
Memories made in the coldest winter, winter, winter
Goodbye my friend, will I ever love again?
Goodbye my friend, will I ever love again?
Goodbye my friend, will I ever love again?

[Verse 3]
If spring can take the snow away
If spring can take the snow away
Can it melt away all of our mistakes
Can it melt away all of our mistakes

[Hook 2]
Memories made in the coldest winter
Goodbye my friend, I won't ever love again
Never again
