[Verse 1: Grav]
My style stays on point like spraypaint on eight trains
Try to picture that shit and it'll blow you out the frame
Now c'mon, my rap skills are beyond
Verbals make niggas fold like futons
When they try to switch styles and get convertible
I loosen up screws so that their joints ain't workable
My tongue is a drill on a mission to kill
Sabotage all those who put up a facade
And fake like they're kings, they're just peasants
Tempted like Christ meetin' the devil in the desert
Repentin' for their mortal sins
Tryna fuck around with Grav when they couldn't win
Yo check my lyrical microphones
Just like [?] speaker cones
See when a nigga spends time in the lab
It works fast so we givin' others jet lag
That's how me and my team keep catchin' [?]
And expand like bands on a soloflex
So what all these bitch niggas want?
Ain't no need for Grav to ever front, yo forever like this

[Hook: Grav]
What these niggas want from skills you'll never [?]
Represent Down to Earth forever, who? G-G-G-Gravity
Yo what they want? Front skills never mean
Represent Down to Earth forever, who? G-G-G-Gravity

Oooh God I warned yah, I hit that ass catacorner
And still be gettin' straight to the point
Smoke mics like joints, wack rappers on the ave
With nothing better to do for the evening, now [?]
[?] behind in a cloud, ka-pow
The dirt and dust, from ill lyrics that I bust
Rhymes are more underground than archaeological finds
So thus I influence minds, like narcotics
I [?] if you don't [?]
[?] funk mechanisms than robotics
I be tellin' weak crews, come on [?]
[?] in a planetary like [?]
I [?] cause my flows is prime
And my mind skills is optimus, it ain't no stoppin' us
Yo even if you built the strongest barricade
GRAV breaks through, niggas still gettin' slayed
Yo even if you had the longest ruler
You still couldn't measure, nigga's too deep like sunken treasure
