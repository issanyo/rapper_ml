[Intro: Fuzzy Jones]
Well, it is a weeping
And a mourning and a gnashing of teeth
It is a weeping and a mourning
And a gnashing of teeth
When it comes to my sound which is the champion sound
Believe

[Hook]
Okay, Lamborghini Mercy
Your chick, she so thirsty
I'm in that two-seat Lambo with your girl
She tryna jerk me
Okay, Lamborghini Mercy
Your chick, she so thirsty
I'm in that two-seat Lambo with your girl
She tryna jerk me
Okay, Lamborghini Mercy (Swerve)
Your chick, she so thirsty (Swerve)
I'm in that two-seat Lambo with your girl
She tryna jerk me (Swerve)
Okay, Lamborghini Mercy
Your chick, she so thirsty
I'm in that two-seat Lambo with your girl
She tryna jerk me

[Verse 1: Chris Brown]
Look, I'm in a Lamborghini, with 2 models
21 bottles, a Murcielago
A nigga gone when I hit the throttle
Then she give me the crazy head, a nigga swerve, then hit a pot-hole
I'm riding in that big boy, 500K on my outcast
A gotta whole lotta girls in Dubai
I got a bush bitch in the outback
Got Adidas from my feet up, check my sneaker
Get a 100 thousand for the feature
I'm ballin' while you niggas talkin' shit
And y'all bitch ass niggas in the bleachers
With this Versace, just watch me kick my feet up
It's too many niggas in my clique
We all got hits, you niggas gettin' beat up
Believe us, OHB up in this place
Got them Louboutins on
Kick a nigga in his face
I'm a real Virginia nigga, in LA got VA plates
She say I'm sexy, I'm just flexin'
Wayne Gretzky, I skate, yikes

[Hook]
Okay, Lamborghini Mercy (Swerve)
Your chick, she so thirsty (Swerve)
I'm in that two-seat Lambo with your girl
She tryna jerk me (Swerve)
Okay, Lamborghini Mercy (Swerve)
Your chick, she so thirsty (Swerve)
I'm in that two-seat Lambo with your girl
She tryna jerk me (Swerve)

[Outro: Fuzzy Jones]
Well, it is a weeping
And a mourning and a gnashing of teeth
It is a weeping and a mourning
And a gnashing of teeth
When it comes to my sound which is the champion sound
