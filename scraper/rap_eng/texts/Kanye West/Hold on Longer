[Produced by 88 Keys, Dave Tozer & Kanye West]

[Verse 1]
Broken hearts rain on our heads 'til it floods
But I won’t run, I’m with you, that’s enough
Kiss me now so you won’t run

[Hook]
Out of breath underwater
Girl you can hold on longer
Girl you can hold on longer
Girl you can hold on longer
Long as you want
Oh, oh, oh, oh

[Verse 2]
Love is an ocean
Swimming and try not to drown
Right in the waves
Praying we don’t go down
In the undertow I’ll pull you out

[Hook]
