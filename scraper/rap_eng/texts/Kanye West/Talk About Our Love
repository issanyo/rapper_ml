[Verse 1: Brandy]
What ya hear this time
Go on and speak your mind
I know somebody's lying
It's always somethin
Her auntie told your cousin
Then all your homies jumped in
And now the whole hoods buzzin
He said, she said
Don't let it get in ya head
Baby don't say
Something that you will regret
I'm on your team
It's us against them you'll see
Hey, we ain't gon stop
They just want what we got

[Chorus: Brandy]
The more they talk about our love
The more they make it obvious
The more they seem so envious
How can they talk about our love
When they don't know one thing about us
Instead they just runnin they mouths
So all we do is tune them out

[Verse 2: Brandy]
I swear they got some nerve
Spreadin what they heard
I can't give them no burn
I can't be concerned with all that talk
I won't be involved
That's my word
See I'm not the one
They got me confused
They got me messed up
Don't you think I've had enough
When it comes to what we do
All that matters is us two
Don't pay them no mind
We just gon show and prove

[Chorus: Brandy]
The more they talk about our love
The more they make it obvious
The more they seem so envious
How can they talk about our love
When they don't know one thing about us
Instead they just runnin they mouths
So all we do is tune them out

[Verse 3: Kanye West]
Heres a couple of things I can't honor man
How you listen to a girl that still wanna man
Tell me the truth is that a man or Juwanna Man
I'm wonderin why she ret ta go like Wanda then
When we met you was a V like Madonna, man
Now you in the field, runnin' plays like Donovan
McNabb before you get in a cab
I trade in my cash
Just to take you back to last summer, man
You don't remember when you was my sweetest
You don't remember I called you Reese's Pieces
Cause it's no wrong way to do you know what
She turned around, giggled, said "You so nuts!"
But nowadays we actin' way too grown up
Like how ya ex girl get that new number
The rumors was so numerous
For sticking' by me, I had to give you two thumbs up
And that's why

[Chorus: Brandy]
The more they talk about our love
The more they make it obvious
The more they seem so envious
How can they talk about our love
When they don't know one thing about us
Instead they just runnin they mouths
So all we do is tune them out

[Outro: Brandy]
The more they talk about our love
The more they make it obvious
The more they seem so envious
How can they talk about our love
When they don't know one thing about us
Instead they just runnin they mouths
So all we do is tune them out
I don't wanna hear it no more
