Alright
To my niggas
Alright

When I had no dough
I had no ride
You wouldn't even talk to me
Now I got a record deal
When my Bapes is right
Now you want to fuck with me, (to all my dogs)

I said "No, bitch. I’m not the one"
You can't win your game on me
So I spend my dope on some money hoe, (yeah)
When now I get the pay for free, (Uh, uh, uh, uh)

All of a sudden now she's on my dick
Was in the sound factory when she heard my shit
We met a few times before
I knew her girl, Lenore
Told Lenore I couldn’t score
Too rugged and raw
But once girlfriend heard I did the benjamins
And that I rolled with Puff Daddy and all his friends and them
And that I moving on up like George Jefferson
Girl, I fucked him way back, but I'll fuck him again
So she
Casually
Walked by me
Winked her eye
Showed her thigh
She wants to talk to me
I caught your drift
You caught my sniff
You smelling sweet, boo
And for the fifth or sixth time: nice to meet you
So she wants to talk about shit I don't give a fuck about
All I want to know if we fuckin', boo
What time we out?
My truck's out front with TVs in it
And if I ain't fucking you tonight like BIG
I ain't with it

When I had no dough
I had no ride
You wouldn't even talk to me
Now I got a record deal
When my Bapes is right
Now you want to fuck with me, (smile)

I said "No, bitch. I’m not the one"
You can’t win your game on me, (yeah)
So I spend my dope on some money, hoe, (they come in all shapes and sizes, you know what I'm saying)
When now I get the pay for free, (even when they got it)

I met this bad rich bitch
Bank account on swoll
Said she loves to get high
But don’t know how to roll
So y'all know me
Always on my J.O.B
And since she keep a nigga high
The blunt stays on me
5'5", chinky eyes like Nia Long
Says she gets horny when she hears my song (hmm)
She got a team of hoes
Fine, but dirty and rotten they scheming hoes
Says she saw me in my videos minked out
Blue face rolly
Cuban linked out
Detroit player style
Pinked out
At bar buying the drinks out
That's how players do
Wait in line and I’ll be playing you
Here's the keys to room 112 where I'll be slaying you
And disobeying you
Getting you before you get me
Shit, I'll pay for a cab, bitch
Pussy was free

When I had no dough
I had no ride
You wouldn't even talk to me
Now I got a record deal
When my Bapes is right
Now you want to fuck with me, (we gotta get his money)

I said "No, bitch. I'm not the one"
You can't win your game on me, (can't win your game on me, baby)
So I spend my dope on some money, hoe
When now I get the pay for free

When I had no dough
I had no ride
You wouldn't even talk to me, (you wouldn't even fuck with me)
Now I got a record deal
When my Bapes is right
Now you want to fuck with me


I'm keeping it real
You cut off everything you say
But in your head you finish the statement
But you end it with "you know what I'm saying"
But you know what I'm saying already
We, we, but we gotta figure it out is what I'm saying
You don't be saying what you be meaning
Or you don't completely say what you be saying
But you know what I'm saying without me saying it
Yeah, but I gotta, I gotta go to math class or some-I gotta go another school to figure it out, like I-you know
When I speak, I speak directly at a nigga
Like yo ,yo, I want-I'm hungry, I'd like something to eat
You be like you be like yo like yo, your stomach ain't kinda like hurting like....
