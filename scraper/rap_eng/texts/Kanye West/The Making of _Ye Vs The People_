[Kanye]
Like these is all super pretty things that make you feel everything is safe
I got my polo shirt, I got my horse, it's all good
I got my cross on me

[T.I.]
I agree, but I just think that when you have lives lost
As artists, that gives us an obligation to stand up against all of that kinda shit

[Kanye]
You know, me putting the hat on forces an evolution because
There's, even for me, I know so much more in the past 3 days
Because I'm getting this energy, positive or negative
Agreeing with me, disagreeing with me
It's like, and that like sharpens the diamond, that shit
Our mind, our conscienceness the way we're thinking
Just breaking some shit

[T.I.]
Your intentions, from what you tell me, are pure
But the direction that you took to get there is a bit unorthodox
And kind of... I would say - some people would say thoughtless

[Kanye]
If I had not done what I felt and I just thought
Then it would've just never happened
And when I wear that hat it's like a fight for equality
Like "oh I can wear this hat too"
I think people get mad at me when I name my idols
And I don't say Michael Jordan, I say Disney

[T.I.]
I just want you to consider all the people who just might be terribly, like, just torn apart and hurt

[Kanye]
I really wanna take that hurt off of them and let them understand that I did not wear that hat to hurt them
Half the shit Trump does, I don't agree with

[T.I.]
What half do you agree with?
Let's get that out

[Kanye]
Just the ability to do what no one said you could do
To do the impossible is the most inspiring thing to me

[Kanye, to someone else in the room]
Did you play that umm, the one that said
"Tell Daddy what you learned in school"
(You wanna play with that, boy?)
I wanna play with that, yeah
(Alright, okay)

[Kanye, on a playback of "Ye Vs The People"]
"I was in debt and the car that broke
The same shit I've been saying for years they called it "loc"
Successful man, a man that [?] the [?]
The most successful man the one's who can afford the most mistakes
And play with them"

[Kanye]
You could mix into that cause I basically gave a lotta my side on that

[T.I]
Sure

[Kanye]
You know what I'm saying?
And your shit come in, you say
"Whoa whoa whoa, what you say?
How could that be?
[murmurs]"
You know what I'm saying?
The exact conversation we're having
And what would you say?

[T.I.]
Sure
"Yeah I'm just trying to figure where you're trying to go with this
Some things you don't align with and some shit you just don't go against"
That would kinda [gestures], you know

[T.I., in recording studio]
Let me hear it bro, let me see what we got here

[T.I. listens on a set of headphones]

[T.I., recording]
"... you're goin' now
'Cause everything that you built can be destroyed and torn down"

[Kanye, recording]
"... know everybody emotional
"Would it be better if I rapped about selling crack?
Because it's cultural?
Or how about I'ma shoot you? Or fuck your bitch?
Or how about all this Gucci, or I'm fuckin' rich?"

Or uhh, I could fuck your bitch

[T.I., recording]
"Here's a suggestion, be selective with your critical views
Of people who done made greater contributions than you"

[Kanye, on a playback of "Ye Vs The People"]
"I know Obama was heaven-sent
But ever since Trump won, I felt like I could be president"
