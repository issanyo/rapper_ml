[Intro: Cam'ron over Chorus]
Killa, Killa, Killa, Killa, uhh
Bring 'em, uhh, yo, uhh yo, yo, yo
Uh, Killa, Dipset

[Verse 1: Cam'ron]
Yo, yo, yo, the way I been treated in this industry? Not nicely
Little faggot motherfucker like {*Mike Lighty*}
Tried to get someone to pop my chain
Gettin' robbed dog, is not my game
My nigga hopped out the van real quick, cocked that thang
Reversed the situation, popped his chain
Be happy we ain't pop his brain
Ayo, I treat that show money, Mike..
Like it's coke money, aight?
So you better have it, consequence could be a casket
I'm beyond forensic, a menace with a matic
I'ma leave 'em in the streets just splattered
Beat and battered, fuck cops, police don't matter
Bring 'em to me

[Chorus]
Bring 'em dead or alive (WHOA!)
Ah-oh no, bring 'em dead or alive (WHOA!)
Bring 'em dead or alive (WHOA!)
Ah-oh no, bring 'em dead or alive (WHOA!)
Bring 'em dead or alive (WHOA!)
Ah-oh no, bring 'em dead or alive (WHOA!)
Bring 'em dead or alive (WHOA!)
Ah-oh no, bring 'em dead or alive (WHOA!)
Bring 'em dead or alive (WHOA!)
Ah-oh no, bring 'em dead or alive (WHOA!)

[Break: Jim Jones over Chorus]
Triple noooooo, come on, B's up, Dipset, uh

[Verse 2: Jim Jones]
Yo, ayo I pop to my name
With not a dollar, not a cent, not a rock to my name
Yo I'ma keep it funky dog, I'll hop my chain
For a block of cocaine, now it's back to my block with cocaine
You know, re-in up, and fillin' up them pots with cocaine
Then you chop it up, and bottle up and top the cocaine
Got watch for the cops and they chains
For them Diplomatic affairs, automatic'll flare
I whips everything from automatics to gears
Yeah, you know sticks I clutch 'em
Shots with 6 I bust 'em, cop kicks to scuff 'em
Fuck 'em, hop out the 6 and crush 'em
Hop in the 6 and dust 'em, BOOM!

[Chorus]
Bring 'em dead or alive (WHOA!)
Ah-oh no, bring 'em dead or alive (WHOA!)
Bring 'em dead or alive (WHOA!)
Ah-oh no, bring 'em dead or alive (WHOA!)
Bring 'em dead or alive (WHOA!)
Ah-oh no, bring 'em dead or alive (WHOA!)
Bring 'em dead or alive (WHOA!)
Ah-oh no, bring 'em dead or alive (WHOA!)
Bring 'em dead or alive (WHOA!)
Ah-oh no, bring 'em dead or alive (WHOA!)

[Verse 3: Cam'ron]
Yo.. ayo, these niggas talkin' shit?
They about to get hit with fuckin' clips
You better let 'em know
I got girls that'll buy my a quarter
Supply me with water, beef come? Drive me to borders
Kamikazes with they hommies, body your daughter
Turn your whole crew into Dodgers like Tommy Lasorda

[Verse 4: Jim Jones]
Yeah, come on
So you faggots have that money in order
Jim'll come through with wolves and let the hungry extort ya
Now how is that for the drama suspense?
Any beef, our piranhas get sent
Kidnap your momma for rent
Hot shots from the Beretta'll a fly
I'm breakin' bread with my guys, we want it dead or alive
Dipset, BOOM!

[Chorus]
Bring 'em dead or alive (WHOA!)
Ah-oh no, bring 'em dead or alive (WHOA!)
Bring 'em dead or alive (WHOA!)
Ah-oh no, bring 'em dead or alive (WHOA!)
Bring 'em dead or alive (WHOA!)
Ah-oh no, bring 'em dead or alive (WHOA!)
Bring 'em dead or alive (WHOA!)
Ah-oh no, bring 'em dead or alive (WHOA!)
Bring 'em dead or alive (WHOA!)
Ah-oh no, bring 'em dead or alive (WHOA!)
