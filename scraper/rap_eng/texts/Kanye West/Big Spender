[Hook: (Kid Talking)]
Hey big spender, hey big spender, hey big spender

[Bridge: Nick Cannon]
I don't see no shows, I don't see no rolls
I don't see no lolos, and a low profile
As far as the wardrobe goes, all those ain't your clothes
The product placement videos with no logos
You got a chain, no glow
Got a deal, no dough
Just the same, Joe small throwbacks and corn ropes

[Verse 1]
Not a good first weeks, worry gonna blow
But there's no need to front you broke we both know
Had the hoes rolling in drows
Now you over exposed
Pointing to your account and the amounts you owe
Your record was so close not def just so so
How you label don't know you on talking no show
The only time you in the streets is just signs for promos
Yo everybody know who wrote your stole flow
You gotta pay him too, your publician's a no go
I got speddy gonzales dollars and yours is slow mo

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
You never seen a nigga quite like this before
He was stunting hard as hell before you even got to blow
Magazines claim he gassed like Texaco
Cause Jesus walk with him in Mexico
Back when the cars cost too much to floss
Them alligator boots? I stitched those
Body official, how, when my money stayed in the rear like Game or DJ Quik's clothes
And I just wanted to go platinum one time
Nick, he still spending money from Drumline
Man when I finish this Usher tour up
I'ma try my best to clear my credit score up
It it cause the Yves Saint Laurent on the glasses?
Or is it cause my name on them backstage passes?
Niggers always asking where his maybachs is
Motherfucker have you seen my taxes?

[Hook](x2)

[Verse 3: Nick Cannon]
They thought you was gonna blow, but now you weren't
I got good news though, I just saved the car insurance
You probably learn and this music game all in crack
Need to go back to slinging crack
In fact you wasn't even good at doing that
Yo your street credibility, you ruined that
Trying to be [?] and pursuing rap
Far as wack contracts, you was doomed from that
Manger threw your door, now you sewing black
What I get for a track you never make in life
I'm like when coke just hit, I make a million a night
Yo what happened to your [?]?
Yeah I seen you on cribs, that's not what you live
Man  I know your babies mom
Why you dodging your kids?
Yeah I make big money, yeah I drive big cars
But I can do that dog, I'm a movie star
