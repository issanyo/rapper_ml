[Verse 1]
I've got something new for you
When it hits you won't know what to do
Relax let me move you
Don't resist it's in the air
Just one taste will take you there
Let it flow right through you

I know your getting tired of the same old thing
But I'm gon' break the rules gonna change the game
You'll be screaming my name
And I'm gonna take you places that you've never seen
You couldn't picture this in your wildest dreams
Don't fear cause you're here with me

[Hook]
Let's get lifted
(Lifted)
Ohh I'm gonna get you high
I'm really gonna blow your mind
We'll get lifted
(Lifted)
Your gonna feel it in your soul
And baby you will lose control
We'll get lifted
(High)

[Verse 2]
And once you take a hit of this
You won't ever wanna quit
You'll be so addicted
Then I'll have you spinning round and round
Crazy making freaky sounds
You won't want to come down

And then I'll have you seeing things and hallucinating
Even walking funny 'cause your legs are shaking
All night we'll be blazin'
I'll take you for a walk to the other side
We can get high and enjoy the ride
Hold tight and we'll be alright

[Hook]

[Outro]

Yeah I'll take you there come on let me take you there

(So much I wanna show you I'll take you high, high)
Yeah I'll take you there come on let me take you there
I will show you
(So much I wanna show you I'll take you high, high)
Yeah I'll take you there come on let me take you there
(So much I wanna show you I'll take you high, high)
