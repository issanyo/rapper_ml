[Intro: Ken Kaniff]
Uhh, hell yea man, hm, oh fuck yeah
When I'm not at home beating my shit to death
I'm listening to The Madd Rapper's album
This is Ken Kaniff and I'm still mad as hell, fuck you

[Verse 1: Eminem]
I'm crazy with this razor, with this razor I'm crazy
With this crazor I'm razy, razor crazed, I'm crazy
(Okay, I'm re-loaded) Go bring Jay Z
(Tell them him I'mma ghostwrite for him) on Dre's beats
Ran in the ladies' room naked in a blanket
At the banquet and started to spank it (ahh)
Came in the bank with a tank fired a blank at the clerk and handcuffed her ankles
To the safe and thanked her but I didn't take nothing (thanks)
Every bullet came from the same gun, just from different angles
Cause I was picking strange places to aim from
(Man, I bet you fifty bucks you won't jump out the window Shady)
*Crash* (Ahhhh!!) pay me

[Verse 2: The Madd Rapper]
Psyche, no bread, fucked up in the head
Shot my girl and my sister cause I caught them in bed
(Wait, wait, wait)
I'm a crazy motherfucker might shoot me a Fed
Or I just might start a fist fight instead
See as far as the dough go, I go loco
See me pumpin' gas at your local Sunoco
Stuck off the hydro, mixed with cocoa
Jump turn styles, then run from po-po

[Hook: The Madd Rapper & Eminem] x2
Life stinks, we don't give a fuck son, we crazy
Tear up the clubs and do drugs, we crazy
Fuck wild hoes and bust slugs, we crazy
Madd rapper is crazy, Slim Shady is crazy

[Verse 3: The Madd Rapper]
I wish I'd been aborted, my pockets got a shortage
Everything I wanna floss I can't afford it
I'm trying to sell an o, my pops trying to snort it
My daughter's babysitter is about to be deported
I'm mad cause I still stand in line for clubs
Mad cause my rottweiler still shits on the rugs (God Dammit Spike)
Feeling kinda crazy now, I just might flip out
Slim Shady gave me shrooms and I might trip out, like
(Eh.... Oh... Dude
Yo, this shit is crazy... oohhhh..... This is
Incredible... ohhh....)
Fuck that Slim keep that for yourself
You a crazy white dude and you need some help
Word

[Verse 4: Eminem]
I got a beautiful wife, kids, and a gorgeous home
What would make me jump in the tub with a cordless phone?
I'm straight vicious, I hit you with plates and dishes
Leave you with eight stitches
What I'm gay cause I hate bitches
Slut, don't be nice to me, I've had it with girls
And I'll still be mad at the world
Even if it apologized to me (sorry)
You're hearing the last thoughts of a man about to blow his fucking brains out
Fall back with a blood stained blouse on top of his spouse
Spread out on a blood stained couch
In front of his kids that he just killed in the same house
I'm sicker than Boy George picturing Michael Jackson
In little boys' drawers shopping at toy stores
Shady said it, Shady meant it, I stay demented
I'll throw a stroller at you, with a baby in it
Go ahead pull the plug, think I won't smack you
I just dropped a fucking pill mom, don't vacuum

[Hook]
