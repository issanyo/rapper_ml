[Verse 1: Teyana Taylor]
Anything for my baby, I'd do some crazy things (yeah)
So whatever he want, he can get that
Long as I like, we can hit that, hoes, we don't love 'em, no
Soon as we done she leavin' right out the door
If you can keep our freaky secret on the down low
We can have a special thing going on, woah

[Chorus]
Threeway, I couldn’t wait to have with you
'Cause I know it turn you on, so let's do it, babe
'Cause two heads are better than one
Threeway, I couldn’t wait to have with you
'Cause I know it turn you on, I had to do it, babe
'Cause two heads are better than one (one, one)

[Verse 2: Teyana Taylor]
I'ma take off my skirt then she gon' touch me right there
Then it's gon' be your turn, so, baby, don't you be scared
We gon' need all of your lovin', whatever you got to give
You was talkin' and shit, time to get up in them ribs tonight
I told you I’ma ride til' I die

[Chorus]
Threeway, I couldn’t wait to have with you
'Cause I know it turn you on, so let's do it, babe
'Cause two heads are better than one (one, ooh)
Threeway, I couldn’t wait to have with you
'Cause I know it turn you on, I had to do it, babe
'Cause two heads are better than one

[Verse 3: Ty Dolla $ign]
Ooh, three ways, her on top of me
You, on my face, ride me like the Wraith
With the stars on the ceiling, told me I'm too deep in
No, I ain't been cheating, I swear you always reaching, oh
You said you a freak just like me baby
Guess you met your match
I watch you licking on her while I beat it from the back
Your secret lies safe with me, I'm with it whenever you ready

[Chorus: Teyana Taylor & Ty Dolla $ign]
Threeway (woah, woah)
I couldn’t wait to have with you (with you)
'Cause I know it turn you on (turn me on)
So let's do it, babe
'Cause two heads are better than one (ooh yeah, ooh yeah)
A threeway, I couldn’t wait to have with you
'Cause I know it turn you on, I had to do it, babe
'Cause two heads are better than one
