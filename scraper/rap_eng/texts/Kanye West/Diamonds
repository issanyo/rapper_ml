Diamonds, darlin'
(Christina)

(Kanye)
Aye, aye
Uh
You love my diamonds, don't you?
Love the way a nigga shine, don't chu?
Baby what's your disposition
Have you ever tried dis position?
You my dream girl
From the poster's that I thought I'd never get a close to

In a black limousine with chauffeurs
Right next to the testerosas
It's funny how all the jewelry
Just get your cat so furry
They look so good all together
They say they are forever

You love my diamonds, don't cha
That I bought from all this rhyming
But I know you'll never love me
You'll only love my diamonds

(Christina)
You pick me up on a hot summer night
I fall in love with you multiple times
Got me wrapped around your finger
Boy, I hope your love lingers
(I doo I doo)

You're my one and only rock in the rough
I like to floss you, baby
You light me up
And there ain't no way I give you away
He's my d-d-diamond daddy and I just gotta have him

When I love you, baby
I wanna love you just like I love my diamonds
Diamonds, diamonds
And when I wear you out at night, boy
Yeah, we'll be shinning
Diamonds, Diamonds

I'll treasure you, cherish you
Where you on my body, ooh
Cause we go together like diamonds are forever
You're my ice blue baby
Oh
And I love you like my diamonds
I do

Like every girl
I'm into fabulous things
Like oyster pearls and big raft diamond rings
But you're my precious possession
I'd rock you 24/7
(I doo... I doo..)

All my accessories
I'd give them up
(Yeah, just like you)
On eBay
Trade them in for your love
(That's what I'd do.)
There ain't no way
I'm giving you away
You're my diamond daddy and I gotta have you

When I love you, baby
I wanna love you just like I love my diamonds
Diamonds, diamonds
And when I wear you out at night, boy
Yeah, we'll be shining
Diamonds, diamonds
I'll treasure you, cherish you
Where you on my body, ooh

'Cause we go together
Like diamonds are forever
You're my ice blue baby
Oh
And I love you like my diamonds
I do

You sexy, you fine
I'm so glad you're mind
You sexy, you fine
He's my one of a kind

You sexy, you fine
I'm so glad you're mind
You sexy, you fine
He's my one of a kind

When I love you, baby
I wanna love you just like I love my diamonds
(Diamonds, diamonds)
And when I wear you out at night, boy
Yeah, we'll be shining
(Diamonds, diamonds.)

I'll treasure you, cherish you
Where you on my body oooh
'Cause we go together
Like diamonds are forever
You're my ice blue baby
Oh
And I love you like my diamonds
I do
(Diamonds, diamonds.)
