At number 5 we start with the conceptually beautiful "telegraph ave. ("Oakland" by Lloyd). Partners in crime Donald Glover & Ludwig Goransson deliver an 808 bass line and intuitive use of equipment to snare a nostalgic sound. I had the pleasure of speaking to Goransson about the beat and he commented on the use of an iPhone microphone to capture Donald's voice, essentially making him sound like a sample. It worked wonders, the overlap of Donalds crooning on the aged sonics works a treat!
