[Hook: Tony Williams]
It don't really matter what you do
There'll never be another you
They ain't never been up in your shoes
There'll never be another you
It don't really matter what you do
There'll never be another you
Baby you ain't got nothing to prove
There'll never be another you

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Aye...B, C, D, E, F
We picking up right where we left...
Off, and I took a recess
When I get back you gon' take that...
Off, in the mirror like hey me, stay me
I make money, money don’t make me
Hey honey, what do you take me...
For, don’t look at me like I’m crazy
Don’t ever think that'd phase me
You ain’t finna do nothing, you ain’t crazy
You ain’t built like, that
Hey baby what it feel like, ahhh
Just forget I said it, screw it
It don’t really matter what you do when you do it
Tony Williams in this bitch, who you is

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Tony Williams]
You can go, you can come
You can walk, you can run
Do whatever you want: just have fun
Dictatorship's not for human people
What good is love if we can't be equal
What good if light if it does not shine?
Go on and get yours cause I'm gonna get mine
How do you get old if you never been new?
I'm telling you the truth baby!

[Hook]

[Bridge: Tony Williams]
Here’s another day in the life
Of a champion knight
Do I still have some fight
I’m ashamed but I might
Whether wrong, whether right
I see danger in sight
Are we going in?

[Verse 3: Kanye West]
I’m feeling like Stevie right now, you know…
I had the strangest feeling lately
The nigga's so fake I'm off it
And every time they flake like frosted
I just make my profit
And get a girl who barely bra fit
Aw shit! He back on his feet like carpet
He was just playing possum
Playing like I wasn't awesome?
Yeah I got some jokes, don't I?
Ha ha ha, laugh it up
And they'll be wack
And we'll be the last ones cracking up
Matter fact, because you nigga wanna doubt me?
Let's see how it feel without me
Taking off on this rocket, Yao Ming

[Hook]
