[Intro: The Younghearts]
We got love
Love, love
You better believe it
We got love
Love, love
You better believe it

[Verse 1]
I got house in the carriage yeah
I got black love in marriage yeah
They gon say you can't have it but
I'm like don't kill the messenger
We gon break the stigma up
Huxtables to the Obamas
It ain't about where you been
Where you from
What you got
It's all about love
Self love is the best love
When you go take that wristband off
That pity party been over
Don't need makeup to dress you up
I gave birth on the bathroom floor
Just me, Iman, and headphone cords
Don't let this life defeat you
I hope this message reach you

[Chorus]
Throw your hands up
Play catch with the hundreds
Love is the new money
I'm just chillin' with the homies
Home is where the heart is
Throw your hands up
Play catch with the hundreds
Love is the new money
I'm just chillin' with the homies
Home is where the heart is
Throw your hands up

[Bridge]
We got love
Love, love
You better believe it
We got love
Love, love
You better believe it

[Verse 2]
I live in abundance
Love is the new money
I'm mentally wealthy
Spiritually conscious
I'm fresh outta Onyx
I'm bawlin' and ballin'
I play with the hundreds
Love is the new money
That's my frequency
Spark up burn the sage
Clear the room kill the hate
Love is the new wave

[Chorus]
Play catch with the hundreds
Love is the new money
I'm just chillin' with the homies
Home is where the heart is
Play catch with the hundreds
Love is the new money
I'm just chillin' with the homies
Home is where the heart is

[Bridge]
We got love
Love, love
You better believe it
We got love
Love, love
You better believe it
Love, love, love
You better believe it
We got love
Love, love
You better believe it

[Chorus]
Play catch with the hundreds
Love is the new money
I'm just chillin' with the homies
Home is where the heart is
Play catch with the hundreds
Love is the new money
I'm just chillin' with the homies
Home is where the heart is

[Lauryn Hill Interlude]
Above all you keep your clarity
You keep your focus
You keep your sense of love
And you keep your sense of purpose
Those are, they're integral
You know, they're key
Happiness
You know, um a lot of people define success differently
You know for me
You can have everything
You could have all the money in the world
But if its not enjoyable, if its not sustainable, you know
If you can't be a person of integrity while having all these things
What does it matter?
What does it mean?
The value is internal
Your value is internal

[Bridge]
We got love
Love, love
You better believe it
We got love
Love, love
You better believe it
