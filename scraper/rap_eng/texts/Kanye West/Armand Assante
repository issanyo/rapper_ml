[Hook]
"Baby, don't let me suffer, cause another won't do
Baby, don't let me suffer, cause another won't do"

[Verse One]
The game's on, Hot Karl dominates y'all ears
I'm making suckas disappear like Amil's career
I'm just joking but you having trouble coping
Cause you beating me is like Def Leppard's drummer jump-roping (not happening)
Cause me and Kanye made this real picante
And grande, while you suckas act Armand Assante
Suburban strangler, angled to rip a stranger
With lyrics so hard I even make Mystikal say "danger"
And right here's an MC that you should fear
Underground like snuff films, throwing 'bows like Laimbeer
Crushing the rest 'til there ain't nobody left
And if I don't go double platinum then I'm blaming Wyclef
So rhyme for rhyme, line for line let's get it done
None other will do when my crew's out there having fun
Punchlines like landmines, Bensonhurst to Anaheim
I'm dropping dimes while y'all suckas silent like pantomimes
What

[Hook]
Don't let me
Run off at the mouth

[Verse Two]
I'm always into something, got everybody running
It's my year, dawg, warn Tyrese that I'm coming (I'm coming!)
Fucking up the scene, take away the self-esteem
The Jewish Jay-Z, call me William Hollastein (Hova!)
I keep attacking and send your crew packing
Nobody's feeling you, like Kobe Bryant rapping (ouch)
So keep on yapping, it's obvious you hate me
Real racy, expose myself like I was K-Ci
Now I'm bringing new views to the table
Able to bring in more kids than Jermaine Dupri's label (so def)
Take you out and watch you blow come to an end
Able to go three the hard way without Puffy's friends (let's did it)
Changed the game before one song was finished
Spent so much cash, made Farmclub go out of business (ching!)
You ain't touching the Baldwins at all
It's a family dawg, drink babies and suck balls
Like what

[Hook]
Don't let me
Run off at the mouth

[Verse Three]
Can't wait until I'm platinum and drowning in wealth
So I can talk about my cash and sound like everyone else
Wrecking this, more infectious than asbestos
Making heads bob up and down like motherfucking Pez dispensers
I'll take your wig and part it in the middle
Cause any one of ya mizzles ain't fucking with Hot Kizzle (nope)
And that's for shizzle, obvious and of course
Dangerous like sporting ice to the next Source Awards
The shit I kick is on a unique level
And we call it rebel when we got some fights that we want settled
Beatin' em 'til they can't hear like Halle Berry
You try hard but still fuck up, like Darryl Strawberry
Rip you apart, so baby don't start
Driving down Mulholland in a Hummer go-kart
This is lyric shit, tough shit, never soft
Hot Karl dot com, log on, fuck off
Fuck off

[Hook]
Don't let me
Run off at the mouth

Hot Karl
Ripping up some lyric shit for you
That is, in case you had any questions about the content
Yo
Hot Karl
Kanye West
Uh
Right up in your grill like that
