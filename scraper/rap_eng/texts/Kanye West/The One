[Intro: Cassius Henry]
Check it out
If you're for me girl, I'ma treat you right
Cause tonight I know, you are the one
If you're for me girl, I'ma treat you right
Cause tonight I know, you are the one

[Verse 1: Freeway]
We out in the UK
Free shut 'em down, open up shop
See the spot be the spot with your pay
Me and Cassius killin' the club
And y'all thugs not feelin' him
[?] you're all busts
International Free, still package the D
Rap version of Spike Lee, I write thuggism
Spend a grip then throw a clip at the party
Snatch your chick and have her drippin' for Free
We're rap stars, nigga

[Hook: Cassius Henry]
This party, up in the party
Got my eye on one special shorty
This shorty's gonna be ours and
She's got eyes for me
This party, up in the party
Got my eye on one special shorty
This shorty's gonna be ours and
She's got eyes for me

[Bridge: Cassius Henry]
So beautiful
Just a look at you, girl, turns me on
Damn you smell so good and on the floor
I feel the sexy moves you do

[Interlude: Cassius Henry]
Yo sniper, cut it
Spit it through the wire Kanye

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Look
Anything I sugges'
Just say yes
Cause we rep the UK like SAS
And I got that polo best, yeah I'm fresh to death
Probably the best dressed, yes I confess
And I roll with Cassius
And you know how his cash is
So let me see how that ass is
Baby back it up, yeah that's it
Only thing left to ask is
Who the hottest in UK?
They holla back "You, K."
What more can I say?
If I be tourin'
Don't be borin'
Don't be actin' all righteous, you ain't Lauryn
Maybe this chain'll constitute some brain
I know you ain't no prostitute, but I'm saying
I got the hots for you, and you playing
Baby I'm gone, I need a sure thing
