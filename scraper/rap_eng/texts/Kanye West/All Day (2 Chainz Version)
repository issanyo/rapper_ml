[Intro: Kanye West & (Theophilus London)]
All day, nigga
(Dance, ayy, ayy ayy ayy)

[Chorus: Kanye West]
All day, nigga
How long you niggas ball? All day, nigga
How much time you spent at the mall? All day, nigga
How many runners do you got on call? All day, nigga (swish, swish)
How long they keep you in court? All day, nigga
Take you to get this fly? All day, nigga
Tell your P.O. how-how long you been high? All day, nigga
You already know I'm straight from the Chi, all day, nigga
South, south side! All day, nigga

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
This Ye, nigga
Shoppin' for the winter and it's just May, nigga
Ball so hard, man, this shit cray, nigga
And you ain't gettin' money 'less you got eight figures
For that Jesus piece, man, I've been saved, nigga
Just talked to Farrakhan, that's sensei, nigga
Told him I've been on ten since the 10th grade, nigga
Got a middle finger longer than Dikembe, my nigga, uh
I don't let 'em play with me
I don't let 'em talk to me no kind of way
Uh, they better watch what they say to me
Niggas still gettin' popped on the day to day
Yeah, I still got the hundred with the small face, nigga
Might spend 50 racks on my off day, nigga
You a fake Denzel like the Allstate nigga
If you run into me, better have Allstate with yah
You a Rico Suave nigga
Ride 'round listen to Sade, nigga
If you ain't with us, you in our way, nigga
You an actor, you should be on Broadway, nigga
Cause you do shit the broad way, nigga
Your bitch got a ass, but my broad way thicker
Late for the class, in the hallway, nigga
Yeah, the dropout at it as always nigga, as always
All day, nigga

[Refrain: Allan Kingdom]
I took a young sweet breath, and I reached into my Earth
Gave him what I had left
At that moment I dispersed
At that moment I dispersed

[Chorus: Kanye West]
All day, nigga
How-h-how long you ball? All day, nigga
How much time you spent at the mall? All day, nigga
How long it take you to get this fly, fly? All day, nigga
Tell your P.O. how-how long you been high, high? All day, nigga
Pour some Hen out for my niggas that died, all day, nigga
And I keep a bad bitch on the passenger side, all day, nigga
And you already know that a nigga from the Chi, all day, nigga
South, south, south side, side! All day, nigga

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
I could do this all day, boy
You know I wanna get down (yeah)
Like a light skinned slave, boy
We in the mothafuckin' house! (ayy)
Don't really matter what I make, boy
You know I still go wild
They need that Ye in the streets, boy
There's been a mothafuckin' drought
24/7, 365 days, everybody gettin' paid
People lookin' at me like I'm worth both MJs
Made the release date a police date
People sayin', "Ye, Ye, take it easy"
20 Gs for the Yeezys off of eBay
Niggas do the most and they ain't done shit
Only way I can sum it up, sumbitch

[Bridge: Theophilius London & Kanye West]
So won't you dance? ayy, ayy ayy ayy
All day, nigga

[Guitar Interlude: Paul McCartney]
Whistling

[Interlude: Kanye West]
All day, nigga

[Refrain: Allan Kingdom]
I took a young sweet breath, and I reached into my Earth
Gave him what I had left
At that moment I dispersed
At that moment I dispersed

[Verse 3: 2 Chainz]
Hotter than a blowtorch
Bank account just had a growth spurt
If my partna' goes up, I can play whole court
All we used to do is eat cold cuts, yeah
All day, nigga
Used to sell yay out the hallway, nigga (hallway)
Gunshots rang in the broad day, nigga (broad day)
I like it when my shrimp is sautéed, nigga (sautéed)
All day, nigga
I said you can play this shit like all day, nigga (all day)
Playin' no games, no arcade, nigga
Been doin' this shit since a bald fade, nigga (nigga)
Nigga, dreadlock rasta
Got a lot of dimes in my goddang roster
Put Forgiattos on a red Lamborghini
Now that mothafucka lookin' like a goddang lobster (whooh)
All day, nigga
Smoke me a joint then them eyes red, nigga
Please don't make me fuckin' irate, nigga
If swag was a sport then I'd race niggas, vrrrrrm
Fuck it, I'll annihilate niggas
Came here to violate niggas
Violence, most valuable player
All these checks in the mail
I could check the mailbox all day, nigga

[Outro: Kanye West]
Get low, alright
All day, nigga
Get low, alright
All day, nigga
Get low, alright
All day, nigga
Get low, alright
All day, nigga
South, south, south side, side!
All day, nigga
