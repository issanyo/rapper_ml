[Intro: Madonna]
... back in town

[Hook: Kanye West & Madonna]
We only making the highlights
Baby I'm back in town
I want my whole life to only be highlights
We only making the highlights
I want my whole life to only be highlights
(Highlights)

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Can we play that back one time?
And after that night I'ma wanna play this shit back, I don't know
Sometimes I'm wishin' that my dick had GoPro
So I could play that shit back in slo-mo
I just shot an amateur video; I think I should go pro

[Hook: Kanye West & Madonna]
We only making the highlights
Tell my baby I'm back in town
I want my whole life to only be highlights
We only making the highlights
Baby I'm back in town
I want my whole life to only be highlights

[Interlude: Kanye West]
Uhh (highlights)
Shine like me
(I live my life on the highlights)
(Highlights)
(Oh no!)
(Gotta play this shit back!)

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Ain’t gon lie that pussy might give her a pay stub
She tryna make the highlights how she made love
Whoever did her hair and makeup
Definitely need a pay cut
She went from Ds to an A cup
Tryna get a me to theJacob
