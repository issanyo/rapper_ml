[Kanye West]
I hear the girls scream soon as we arrivin'
You can ask Ibn, we be straight mackin'
Y'all work at IBM, hotels they be in
Ooh la la, tres bien magnifique
Any street

Father is the black Bruce Wayne
Only shorty in preschool rockin' two chains

If you talkin' 'bout marriage, you mean multi-million heiress
