[Bridge]
Yo Yo
Ayo my silent moments, loud as the crack of thunder
My hunger is like the crocodile that attacks the hunter
It ain't commercial or underground, its true cause I
(wanna be good to you)

[Hook]
Call it skill, call it game, call it glow, call my name
Like the lord, all in vain, screaming like you all in pain
Treat it like a drug, all up in ya vein cause (wanna be good to you)

[Verse 1]
We make the squares dance, and get the do like dosey
Y'all niggas roll with pussycats like Josie
All spoiled rotten like ghetto groceries yo
I clutch the mic like ya grandma clutch her rosary yo
Swooping the industry, like a bird to prey
My stanzas has got stamina, ya verses lack vertebrae
I heard them say I was a conscious rapper
But I'm a monster when I hafta smack the shit out of a nonsense actor
Using my 'hands solo' and I don't need Chewy
Over your head like Yarmulkes and Kufis yo
Fuck the screen gems y'all niggas act in B movies
Type of niggas proud to be groupies
Followers in the herd running over the cliff
I'm the "Buffalo Soldier", smoke ya like a dreadlock rasta
Blowing the spliff, loading a clip to spit high
Like you holding blow in a stolen whip, rolling the strip
Looking to hit cops, now that's a 4 alarm
Black queen falling on my arms, you could call it charm
Mater fact call it what you want, its up to you bro
(wanna be good to you)
Yea
Yea
Yea

Chorus (1x)

[Verse 2]
How many niggas ever been in love'
How many niggas really think they thugs
And can't think without the drink and drugs
How many niggas can't get in with hats and sneakers on
Say 'fuck security' and get inside and keep them on
How many niggas think that gats make the weaker strong
Can't do for self and wanna snatch the plate you eating on
That don't take heart, slave nigga play ya part
I'd rather jump over board nigga, face the sharks
We stay doing it, later for the conversation
Hammers is cocked and waiting, niggas is not debating
We ain't got the patience. You found popping shit
Come in to town just to run you down like poppa ditch
And dig a proper ditch, you lying like a politician
Your proposition meets opposition like contradictions
Get out my House, you ain't no real Representative
I make it happen, you ain't official, you tentative
Niggas is sensitive, see how they catching feelings
It's so hot, the sweat rise and it wet the ceiling
Barracuda, Spitkicker nigga that's the crew (wanna be good to you)

[Breakdown]
Whoo! (yeaahh)
Come on
Yeah
Well alright
Yo
Yo
Yo

[Verse 3]
Niggas be claiming shit, find a gangsta movie, put
They name in it, biting like there ain't no shame in it
You the hardest on the beat, I'm the fire that you playing with
You a artist from the street, I'll give you the blood to paint it with
So yeah I'm positive, I'm positive I'm the best
Spit bullets to split ya vest and deposit them in ya chest
Dark is the flesh on my bones, calling Brooklyn home
Hang up on niggas like 'I want you to meet my nigga tone, word
Leave me alone like Michael Jackson
Or there will be more than butterflies in your stomach
Waiting to see what happens
You see me out, know that my crew is flawless
So called gangstas need more security than the Rawkus office
Yo, I thought you bust ya gun
You just a big joke, thinking you a Big Pun
Yo, Kanye this is the big one (wanna be good to you)
Me and my niggas having big fun

Bridge (1x)

Chorus (1x)
