[Intro: Kanye West]
You a bad girl and your friends bad too, ooh
We got the swag sauce she dripping swagu
You a bad girl and your friends bad too, ooh
You got the swag sauce she dripping swagu, ooh

[Verse 1: Beyonce]
I may be young, but I'm ready
To give you all my love
I told my girls you can get it
Don't slow it down, just let it go
So in love
I'll give it all away
Just don't tell nobody tomorrow
So tonight
I'll do it every way
Speakers knocking till the morning light

[Hook: Beyonce and Slick Rick]
Cause we like to party (ay)
We like to party (ay-ay)
We like to party (ay-ay)
We like to party (ay)
Party, Party
Cause we like to party (ay)
We like to party (ay-ay)
We like to party (ay-ay)
We like to party (ay)
Party, Party
Cause we like to party

[Verse 2: Beyonce]
Your touch is driving me crazy
I can't explain the way I feel
Top down with the radio on
And the night belongs to us
Just hold me close don't let me go
So in love
I don't care what they say
I don't care if they're talking tomorrow
Cause tonight's the night uh uh oh aye
That I give you everything
Music knocking till the morning light
Cause we like to party

[Verse 3: J. Cole]
We out in Abu Dhabi, we like to party
We don’t cause trouble, we just ride Bugatti
Bad chick shawty, sorta resemble Sade
Imported her in from Raleigh
And pulled up into the valet
The boy dropped the keys tryna sneak-a-peek at that body
See this that time of the week, she like to freek-a-leak and get naughty
Therefore I like to thank God and Ice Cube for Friday
Cause La-Di-Da-Di… (we like to party)

[Bridge: Beyonce]
So in love
I'll give it all away
Just don't tell nobody tomorrow
Cause tonight's the night uh uh oh aye
That I give you everything
Music knocking till the morning light

[Hook: Beyonce and Andre 3k]

[Outro: Kanye West]
You a bad girl and your friends bad too, ooh
We got the swag sauce you dripping swagu
You a bad girl and your friends bad too, ooh
You got that swag sauce she dripping swagu, ooh
