[Intro]
At last I am free
(So lost, know what I'm sayin')
I can hardly see in front of me
(I'm tryin' to get to the top)
I can hardly see in front of me
(I just need some sorta direction baby you know what I'm sayin')
At last I am free
(Yup, feel like I'm goin' in circles right now)
I can hardly see in front of me
(Lord help me)
I can hardly see in front of me

[Verse 1]
I'm feelin' like I'm losin' my mind, I'm walkin' blind
I'm just rollin' no destination no point or time
I'm lost, tryna find out which way is up
And get what I can get before my days is up
My life was rough, but fuck it shit it could've been worse
I'm free, when I could be in jail or a hearse
Most folks look at my lifestyle and say that I'm blessed
They see my smiles they don't see all the heartache and the stress
They don't see our hoes and foes pretend to be your friend
They love you and down for you 'til your cash flow in
When shit switch they split quick to treat you like a stranger
Then your hangin' like a hanger and give you the middle finger
Like you done somethin' wrong cause you don't provide 'em with drugs
Or do the shit you used to do like payday weigh in the club
I'mma show y'all some love if you don't love me
It's fair exchange or nothin' ain't no robberies
I'm so lost

[Chorus]
At last I am free
I can hardly see in front of me
I can hardly see in front of me
(I'm so lost)
At last I am free
I can hardly see in front of me
I can hardly see in front of me

[Verse 2]
I saw it a million times niggas balled and fall
I witness boys on they feet kneeled down and crawl
I know nothin' lasts forever everything must end
Losers live for the day and the future planners win
But at the same time, niggas grind and shine
We live in danger who's to say tomorrow we won't be dyin'
What's the use of workin' hard if you can't display
What's the use of bein' a baller if you can't go play
It's a lotta ups and downs, smiles and frowns
One day you're here the next day you're gone
I used to dream of gettin' money rockin' diamonds that blind
Nowadays I wish and pray, for a peace of mind
I was safer when I was broke I had to dodge less snakes
When you got some, you don't know who's real or fake
Every day my heart aches from the drama that unfolds
This world cold, I'm tryna find my soul
I'm so lost

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
I'm tryna stay focused, keep both eyes open
Stay on top before my career starts slopin'
Ain't no time for jokin' no time for chokin'
They wanna see me broken I know what they hopin'
Writin' rhymes 'til my pen starts smokin'
Makin' sure hot lines are spoken I got the token
To the game, and it's my job to claim
The fortune and the fame that the industry bring
It's simple and plain, those that work hard share profit
Nobody can stop it you can't stop 'til you got it
I'mma do what I wanna do, live like I wanna live
Spend what I wanna spend yield what I wanna yield
That's how it is I'm controllin' my fate
And shinin' on those who hate to see me live great
I'm snatchin' my plate, takin' my steak and eatin' good
I suggest you do the same and get the fuck out the hood
I'm so lost

[Chorus x2]
