[Hook]
I know that you know I can rip it, I hope that you listen
Blood burgundy soul, heart cold, surgery flowed
They operate like an emergency (Listen to my heartbeat)
Harder, I know that you know I can rip it, I hope that you listen

[Verse 1]
Listen, I know my position, I'm young, your profection is distant
I run to it, it feels like it comes closer but misses
I been exposed to the most vicious, meanin' I know the difference
Between those that are dope or those that are Pulp Fiction
My words are weapons, they serve and protect
Behind verbs and a lesson I teach for the nerve that your testin'
I'll reach you from like thirty directions
Heat you like, the early detections like he questions the reaper to strike
Your number it came and crumbled your fame, into a ball
A umbrella dissolved into flames, you under my brain
You fell in my shower, lyrics my power
Your time is now, this is your hour to listen and it's windin' down
Your mission to make your way if your smart
He play his part, you can never take away his heart, listen

[Hook]
I know that you know I can rip it, I hope that you listen
Blood burgundy soul, heart cold, surgery flowed
They operate like an emergency (Listen to my heartbeat)
Harder, I know that you know I can rip it, I hope that you listen

[Verse 2]
My spit is like a fix or the rinse cycle that gets
Under the dirt, that gets, under the skirt of your bitch
Under your nose, so get onto your toes
This is the reason you ballers is leavin' me all in control, my brother
You should play the back if you loud, I make you fade the black
If you wild so you should stay in back and be proud
I never take for granted my style cause him who handed it down
To me, Slim who demanded, take advantages now
I'm breezin' away from competitive ways
Every day I'm leavin' a race, I'm leadin' every step of the way
That I'm breathin' and the reason that the hunger's increased
I'm under my peeps speed and I'm underneath the numbers I seek
I speak if you never show me respect
No longer lookin' up to rappers, in fact I’m after the ones that I’ve met

[Hook]
I know that you know I can rip it, I hope that you listen
Blood burgundy soul, heart cold, surgery flowed
They operate like an emergency (Listen to my heartbeat)
Harder, I know that you know I can rip it, I hope that you listen
