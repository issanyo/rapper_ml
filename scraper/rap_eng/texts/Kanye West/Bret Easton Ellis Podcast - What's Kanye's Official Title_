Kanye: For me, right now I’m able to talk and be here and live in LA and have a living and get engaged to my girl because I’m a successful musician currently. But if I were to write my title, like, going through the airport you have to put down what you do, I would literally write 'Creative Genius', except for two reasons. Sometimes it takes too long to write that, and sometimes I spell the word “genius” wrong.
