[Kanye West]
And I swear she a riot folks
How she order all that food and a motherfucking Diet Coke?
He said "You lying yo, why is you lying Joe?
Cut it out, quit it G, you hurting my kid-i-neys."
Naw, she talking bout a couple of kids for me
She's hinting at a ring from Tiffany's
Right then and there I had an epiphany
I swear since that day I've been treating fat girls differently
She told me if you read music you a genius
I don't play but I'll introduce you to my pianist
She said you need a little ice just to keep me cool
No dimes but baby here go the family jewels
I'm tight with my doe like my family Jews
Uh! I said "Jews" my career is screwed
I ain't mean in the Hanukkah sense of the word
I realize it's a sensitive word
Plus a lot of best friends is white
I mean ah, I mean my Air 1's, my diamonds and my Benz is white
And I ain't one of them producers that pretend to write
Ayo, Teefa, uh why don't you come on grab the mic

[Teefa]
Yo yo
I know you use to being a womanizer
Coming at me and girls talking 'bout a men-a-
You're some fool
Thinking I'm gon' strip like Moulin Rouge
While you biting off my garter
I'm not easy you gotta come harder
I want a man, not just a baby father
Teefa no [?] no appetizer
Haha
Why you kick it with your guys fo'?
You got eyes for girls, just spread it out
You done pissed Teefa off like draining my bladder out
Haha

[Interlude]
[Kanye]: Aw, you crazy
[Teefa]: You got me up in here tripping
[Kanye]: Nah, but look, I said, I said look

[Kanye]
Ayo my Rocafella chain hurt the game very bad
My girl rocking the little lamb that Mary had
A little bit of Ghostâ€™s style mixed with Mos's style
I'm versatile I'm the poster child
Getting cheese so I'm suppose to smile, get it
We making hits like Sosa now, hit it
And I hate when girls acting bougie as hell
And I already seen them naked like Blu Cantrell

Aw, forget it, forget it
