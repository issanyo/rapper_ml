(Verse 1) Freeway
You better call your local authorities
Switch phones if ya jack not working
Free done hooked up wit Twista
The shits on
And theses clubs don't want no part of me
Say they system got a short and they mics stop working
I throw bows like Ludacris
Light my purple and fall back
Sixty-eight Joe Louis flow
Nothing you can do wit this
If you try to come through wit clips
Tell ya peeps wear skates to ya funeral
Money know
If the show go on
It's going be me Twista his bitch/ hotel
Go-go's on
Light goes off
Her clothes off
And you sitting in the crib like what went wrong
The show jumped off
And she jump on the band wagon
Don't mind her
Next time leave her at home
Can't find her
She wit Twista in a Rover
We got what it takes to take the club over

(CHORUS)
EEEEEEEEEeeeeeeeeeee
Don't let the show go on (2x)

(Verse 2) Bennie Franks
Hey T, Hey Free
Man these niggas want our status
But they ain't sold shit
Man we five hundred in
Records or O's bitch
Thousands yall want promotions
Yall don't wanna work
Who me shit I'm a hustla
I will never hurt
Opps I mean a gangsta I put in work
And if this shit don't sell
Then fuck it we'll rob
But yall gonna learn from fuckin wit ours
I mean yall gonna burn from fuckin wit ours man
I use to sell jars now I slang bars
I use to hang around them bars tryin to stick up stars man
You say you ballin but you gettin it hard
Fuck it
You can keep yo evens let me get yo odds man
Ain't got the dot six but I got a range shit
I can move the blow but I prefer the Cain
Yall gonna respect the name
Legit ballaz colab wit roc a fella
If the show stop
Fuck it we'll spit it acapella

(CHORUS)

(Verse 3 - Twista)
I pop hoes
I'm demanding respect like saso
Gave Bennie blanco from the Bronx
Stuck for yo banco and props
Well I come dressing
To teach these little fellas a lesson
Got the to-tool hid in the bathroom of the delicatessen
I stop him from breathing
Drop his body
While the Spreewells rotating
Niggas hating on how I move my karachie
I catch people open like Carlito
Through the peep hole
So fresh I got him stabbing hisself in the chest like Peoples
You can't fuck wit my flow
Sip on my Moe
Smoke on my dro
And you can't stop a LB show
I spit G rhymes
While you fakers get the vapors
Chants like Jimmy Two Times
I get the papers get the papers
Can't fade us
Match us
Back us
Too good in the kitchen
Me Bennie Franks and Freewezy easy
Make hundred g's moving chickens
Get shit through customs wit passports
We can serve words or pull birds out tha dashboards
Open them curtains while you cry--

(CHORUS)
