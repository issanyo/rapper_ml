[Intro:]
This one for my baller niggas
That hate when the weakest ho in the club try to approach him
Some songs the ladies love me
The girls gon' hate me for this one
But I gotta do it
Come on

[Hook 1:]
Bitch, do I look like your type?
Don't get me wrong, you still gotta look cool to me
Bitch, do I look like your type?

[Verse 1:]
She asked
Is that pronounced N-Y-C?
No, that's a niche
Rock Clavin Klein
So she can see K
I'm still doing 120 on the freeway
She still got a prom picture in her key-chain
I told her look
This ain't high school no more
I'm tryin'a fuck being cool no more
So niggas go ball
Just to perform
Cause all these rats be talking up a storm
I know what they worn
I know what they be liking
If they hair short
Said "They probably be dyking'"
Probably a drying
Probably you like it
I can't know what
You're probably a psychic
I know a crazy bitch by the look in her eyes
I know a cheating bitch gonna look at my guys
I know a fat bitch gonna look at them fries
Tell me on the side like
"Can I supersize?"
Got my meat in my ride
Go down while I drive
Some hoes ain't for show
You just keep 'em inside
Call 'em at 3 AM and get deep up inside
Blow me and my homie, when you see me you don't know me
You heard?

[Hook 2:]
Bitch, do I look like your type?
Don't get me wrong, you still gotta look cool to me
Bitch, do I look like your type?
This ain't a song I made for ugly hoes to start approaching me

[Hook 1]

[Verse 2:]
Woah
She
Rock the jeans above the knees
Oh them must be some kid capris
So I spend cheese
Urp!
Bitch please
Your girlfriend ain't tell you 'bout me
Kanye fuck 'em and leave 'em
Act like he don't need 'em
See titties and squeeze 'em
For no fucking reason
"Ugh, he's so classless grabbing asses
How would you do a nerd bitch with glasses"?
Pimp nigga never spent no dough on a booty
I wish I would take this fat hoe to the movies
Them niggas must not know the price of the Coogi
I'ma little too rich to fuck this broke bitch
The survey says: "By the streets according
Kanye more important than Michael Jordan
Got this rap game locked, you could call the warden
Give hoes cock then I'm gone by morning

[Hook 1 + Hook 2]

[Verse 3]
Damn I was wrong..how could I stoop so low?
Pull up in a four door volvo
Dropped the top and swooped yo hoe
Woah..oh no
I don't want no wild body bitch in my wild body 6
No fucking weak hoes in my fucking Regal
No bitch that's whack in my Cadillac
No bitch with a fade in my Escalade
No sluts with a gut in my Beamer truck
No ? in my gold Jaguar
Deep voice bitches like "{vocalizes deep murmurings}"
"I never thought Kanye would take it this far!"

[Outro]
Remember back in high school?
Like prom queen, right?
She was like 37-25-36
Now she 37 with 25 kids
Ya' know what I'm sayin?
Now she on the come up
Tryna get a baller nigga
Bitch heard my song on the radio
She heard me on the Jagged Edge shit
Memorized my cell phone number out the blue
Called me on some..
"I wasn't sure if that was you or not"
Bitch you ain't hear me say Kanye Titter at the beginning?
Gold digging bitch
