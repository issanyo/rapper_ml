[Intro: Pharoahe Monch]
Violinist extraordinaire
Uh, Miri Ben Ari
Kanye on the beat
And Pharoahe Monch in your area
About to cause mass hysteria
Let's go

[Chorus]
We can't stop let's go, oh
We are the future, you are the past
Don't get in our way, 'cause we'll kick your ass
You might be on top now, but time moves fast
Oh oh oh oh oh, we can't stop, let's go

[Verse 1: Pharoahe Monch]
The master speaks, masterfully, what he has mastered
For floors to change, new laws are forecasted
It's bigger than the dirty south, but bi-coastal
It's global, war and the weapons we choose are Pro Tools
Rap moguls get slapped with vocals
Until they learn this colloquialism, we going postal
It's what I am supposed to do, is oppose you
Revolution to stop the thinking that's old school (whoo)
Let me assist you like Malone from Stockton
I'm in the cockpit, cocked back and locked in
Indoctrinated with these [?] toxins
Refuse to be labeled, degraded and boxed in
Let's go

[Chorus]
Oh oh, we are the future, oh oh, you are the past
Oh oh, don't get in our way, oh oh, 'cause we'll kick your ass
Oh oh, you might be on top now, oh oh, but time moves fast
Oh oh oh oh oh, we can't stop, let's go

[Verse 2: Pharoahe Monch]
We put the gospel on wax, sit back through time
Some five years from now is when I'll conceive the rhyme
The future, fuck, you might want to rewind it back
20-0-9, free speech is a crime
You destroy the very planet you inherit from the past
Tomorrow does not accept credit cards and cash
Quick, you need to push Bush stinking ass outta office
Then observe a 40 day fast, for real
So that the darkness will end
Miri sang with strings, Kanye did it again
Pharoahe provides the light but y'all still question the future
The omen to what's destined, oh

[Chorus]
Oh oh, we are the future, oh oh, you are the past
Oh oh, don't get in our way, oh oh, 'cause we'll kick your ass
Oh oh, you might be on top now, oh oh, but time moves fast
Oh oh oh oh oh, we can't stop, let's go

[Violin solo: Miri Ben-Ari]

[Chorus]
Oh oh, we are the future, oh oh, you are the past
Oh oh, don't get in our way, oh oh, 'cause we'll kick your ass
Oh oh, you might be on top now, oh oh, but time moves fast
Oh oh oh oh oh, we can't stop, let's go

[Violin outro: Miri Ben-Ari]
