[Hook]
I go to Jacob with twenty-five thou
You go with twenty-five hundred, wow
I got eleven plaques on my wall right now
You got your first gold single, damn, nigga, wow

[Verse 1]
H to the Izzo, did three thou spins in a week
You did a thou in a month, wow
Y'all niggas want credit, but y'all need to slow down
Kanye to The killin' y'all from Chi-Town
How your wife gon' say she never sold drugs a day in her life
But she still wanna pump the yay
And y'all mad cause y'all not knowin'
Cause these canaries so yellow
When y'all pull up, whether to stop or keep goin'
I got Gs, rock, rock and roll tees with no sleeves
Tats showin', tucked in, strap showin'
How he get seven TVs in that 'Lac, 'Lac?
Three in the front, two in the back, two in that back, back
While you in that hatchback and tryin' to sell work
And don’t get shit from them packs back
And try to rap, the studio gon' give you your daps back
And try to get published
And all you get is your ass capped and that’s that

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
I just bought my mom a new car and a house
And that's a lot to say for a college dropout
I drove to New York with ten dollars to my name
And brought back a couple platinum plaques on the plane
And brought back that soul shit that changed the game
They have no beat, they had to aim the stain, the steel
Got lizards in my R. Kelly strain
They real, man, I swear to God I wish I had a dollar bill
For every time a nigga told me, "Stick to the beats"
I could've ate at Cheesecake at least six times a week
I got killed these niggas on that lyrical shit
Mayonnaise-colored Benz, I push miracle whips
Gonna save purple haze and some syrup to sip
It have you so right, you drive on the left lane
Gettin' head, crash
Your head hit the window, now that's brain
