Heavy Hitter for life
Heavy hitters for life

You rappers think I give a f*ck about the way the day spent
Want to be on my album but don't want me on they sh*t
Everybody thought i was makin a compelation
I was really makin myself they competation
Fresh off the plane form the all star game
Bone girls on t.v so it's all star trains
Just picture man. No stichin man
Somethin for the phiends fresh out the kitchen man
Last 9/11 I was poor on a half till I floored up my math
Now it's Porsche 9/11 and I'm floorin the gas
Problems that i had no more
Well damn look at how everybody den changed
All my niggas is bout to have it made
Tell j that i'm bout to change the game
This makes everything else sound played
Goddamn Kanye! Kanye! Kanye!
Now hold up. Ain't nobody makin with me dog now you say it
Ain't nobody messin with you at all
I told dude you can't even rap on my interlude
Now does that make me as rude as Jude?
When the album comin out man the people is askin
Yall got motive adidas ya sick with the fashion
Ya already got do so ya spit for the passion
The way ya rhymes give me Tribe Called Quest flash backs
And let's not even bring up the tracks man
Nope nope let's not do that man
Ya eatin up the game like Pac man
And got the whole world shakin just like crack phiends
Heavy hitters for life
Roca fella is for life throw them diamonds up throw them diamonds up trow ya diamonds
