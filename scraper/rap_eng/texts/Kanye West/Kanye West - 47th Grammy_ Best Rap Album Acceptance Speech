And the Grammy goes to... 'The College Dropout', Kanye West.

Umm, ya'll might as well get the music ready cause this is gonna take a while. Umm, when I had my accident, I found out at that moment nothing in life is promised except death. If you had the opportunity to play this game of life, you need to appreciate every moment. A lot of people don't appreciate their moment until its passed. And then you gotta tell them Al Bundy stories, "you remember when I..." but umm. Right now, is my time and my moment, thanks to the fans, thanks to the accident, thanks to God, thanks to Roc-A-Fella, Jay Z, Dame Dash, G, my mother, Rhymefest, everyone that has helped me and I plan to celebrate. I plan to celebrate and scream and pop champaign every chance I get cause I'm at the Grammys baby! I know... I know everybody ask me that question, they want to know, "what Kanye is getting well louder, he's gonna do something crazy." Everybody want to know what I would do if I didn't win... I guess we'll never know.
