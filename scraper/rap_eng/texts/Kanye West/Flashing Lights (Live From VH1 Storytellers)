Let’s go, let’s go, let’s

[Verse 1]
She don't believe in shooting stars
But she believe in shoes and cars
Wood floors in the new apartment
Couture from the store's department
You more like "love to start shit"
I'm more of the trips to Florida
Ordered the hors d'oeuvres, views of the water
Straight from a page of your favorite author
And the weather so breezy
Man, why can't life always be this easy?
She in the mirror dancing so sleazy
I get a call like, "Where are you Yeezy?"
And try to hit you with the ol-wu-wopte
'til I got flashed by the paparazzi
Damn, these niggas got me
I hate these niggas more than a Nazi

[Hook]
As I recall I know you love to show off
But I never thought that you would take it this far
What do I know? (Flashing lights)

[Verse 2]
I know it's been a while sweetheart
We hardly talk, I was doing my thang
I know it was foul, baby
Aye babe, lately, you've been all on my brain
And if somebody woulda told me a month ago
Fronting though: yo, I wouldn't wanna know
If somebody woulda told me a year ago
It'll go get this difficult
Feeling like Katrina with no F.E.M.A
Like Martin with no Gina
Like a flight with no visa
First class with the seat back, I still see ya
In my past, you on the other side of the glass
Of my memory's museum
I'm just saying, hey Mona Lisa come home
You know you can't roam without Caesar

[Hook x2]

You know, I’m ‘sposed to talk about what some of these songs mean
And some of the stuff is so personal to me
And some of the things I’ve been through is so real
In the form that I’m ‘sposed to break down certain things
And this is one of the first times, because I feel like I’m placed in front of the audience right now
And uhm, certain things are just hard for me to talk about
And I’m sorry VH1 for that
But it uhm, certain things are too serious

And I stand before you, just a human being trying to improve under the microscope
Just the star of the Truman show
As every day I take as calculated
Every time I put on my shoes
Under the flashing lights

Just got an email today
A new book coming out
Doctor Adams: the Truth about Donda West
What the media doesn’t want you to know

And you know, now that my momma passed
Would she really want me to put myself in a situation where I go to jail?
FOR KILLING ‘EM

Under the flashing lights
And the public perception
Where I feel like I’m always in defense of myself
And I realize that I’ve made some mistakes, but I grow from them
It’s like I’m fighting to be me, but I have to leave the fight
‘Cause it helps everyone else be who they wanna be

That’s a story for your ass…
