Visions of the world being mine
Through blood, sweat, tears and my rhymes
A nigga who whole life was spent tryna find
A way to rule the Earth, and make the world mine

Yo everyday is a struggle to achieve
The future that my friends and fam didn't believe could happen
Yo rappin is my destiny
Tread water so currents don't get the best of me
Cause sounds in the ghetto can make one drown
Guns blast like corn sticks lit up in Chinatown
So I manifest gifts that God gave
Just to avoid becoming a slave to the wave of ignorance that swarms the land
In mind of every black woman, child and man
I'm on a mission but Satan's on my tail in hot pursuit tryna make sure that I fail
Cause see my soul is the prize in this game and plus the thing that can extinguish the flame
So when the Devil build walls and try to bend me
I break 'em down with swift blows like John Henry

Yo stress is a constant thing in the rap field for real
Tryna avoid the raw deal is dealt
Burnt flesh can probably be smelt but it's a quick death and yo no pain is felt
See checkers is a game that's something like the streets
Bullets crown kings and leave niggas for dead meat
The game that I play though is more like chess
With the mind stimulated and always ready to flex
Yo every move is crucial
If negatives seduce you
The daemons on the Earth will be ready to use you
As a tomb to bring forth the doom of the few that have knowledge in the millions of fools that
Roam the land and still get caught in the fucked up visions of the concrete thoughts
So now my rhymes are just the first sign of how to shape the mind of all mankind

Visions of the world being mine
Through blood, sweat, tears and my rhymes
A nigga who whole life was spent tryna find
A way to rule the Earth, and make the world mine

Visions of the world being mine

See now my brain is the shelter for the imagination
Of bringing forth the nation of millions
Using my rhymes to build men but still men doubt
So I gotta show niggas what it's all about
I roll my soul on hot coals to unfold the steam needed to manifest my dreams
Touch tangible things, visions of reality
Waited my whole life to unleash forces of gravity
Upon spirits of men, mortal men who sin with clipped wings with no way to ascend to the
Heavenly skies of a God most high
Train brains with rhymes so they minds don't die
Struggle paid off see I created armies of men ready to die so no one can harm me
Control the Earth through verbs and vibrations a flawless plan for world domination

Visions of the world being mine
Through blood, sweat, tears and my rhymes
A nigga who whole life was spent tryna find
A way to rule the Earth, and make the world mine

Visions of the world being mine
