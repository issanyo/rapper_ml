[Verse 1: Bon Iver]
Could be lookin' at you
From a freeway trailer
If you'd handled what I'd taken
Separate loans, separate codes
No fine line, don't have to be dead right
Cause dead right can go wrong

[Chorus: Francis and the Lights]
We could be friends
We could be friends
Put your head on my shoulders

[Verse 2: Francis and the Lights]
I'm Francis
Still dreamin' of a glory
Of somethin' new
I can't remember what it's like
To never wanna let go
It's all good though

[Chorus: Francis and the Lights & Kanye West]
We could be friends
We could be friends
Just put your head on my shoulders
I will straighten out, for you
Don't wanna know if you made mistakes
I'm still waiting on your sunshine

[Verse 3: Francis and the Lights]
Ooh, LA
I guess you gotta chase that ghost
Heard you bought some land in Mexico
And I said, "Way to go, man"
Cause wherever you may roam
Remember who you know
There's a station playin' rock and roll
So stay tuned in mi amor
Stay tuned in

[Chorus: Justin Vernon & Francis and the Lights]
I will turn around for you
I will straighten up for your girl
Just put your hand on my shoulder
We could be friends, for you
We could be friends, for you
I will make this promise to you
After all these promises
I'm looking at you now
Still looking for you, still waiting for you
I told you, I'm sorry... I was waiting on a different story
Still waiting on your sunshine
What I tell you
Still waiting on your sunshine
