[Intro: Kanye West] + (Ryo-Z in background)
Yeah
Welcome, ladies and gentlemen
You're so privileged right now to be in the presence of
The truth (The days)
The creator (I praise)
The originator of this style (It's a shame)
Accept no immitations
Kanye To-The (The days)
With The Teriyaki Boyz (I pray)
Big Money League in effect (It's a shame)
I-I-I-I still love H.E.R
I-I still love H.E.R., Hanto E. Rap

(Verse 1)
(Ryo-Z in background)
[Ryo-Z] I remember anokoro wo omoikasu pen

Deai wa School Daze nori de day moushikon demo
[Wise] Say he's just a friend
[Ryo-Z] Mori ni break
Are kara mainichi kimi ni tegami shitatameru
Tame nai chie shibori bokyabu wo drop
Daremo ga hotto, kyashinai hodo hot
Na baby, wo rock, suru ima ja boku no job
[Wise] When They Reminisce Over You, my girl
[Ryo-Z] Torimaku raibaru tachi tono sci-fi
Kimi to asonde itanda maiban
[Wise] I remember (I remember)
I remember (I remember)
I remember back in the day, high tops haite
Sugureta MJ no Dunk Shot kakete
After school, kimi to futari no park
Yofuke made odotte takke
Next day, jugyou chuu, as I read my S.A
Message
Kokoro komete ne
Futari dake no himitsu vocabulary
Chiribameta roburetaa

Got a lot of soul and you know that your on my mind

(Verse 2)
[Verbal] I remember once again, all the times that we spent
All the words that you said, mada kizamarete
Ima demo can't forget
How you let the rhythm hit
Represent dokashitetane just to get a rep
Sonna koro ga fresh
Demo ima de ha all about the
Ikka ku senkin, 'bout the benjamins
About the mesaki no seiko bakari
Ryuu shutsu seiki rara pose on the internet
You know the whole repetoire
Kuchi guse wa kukumei
Datta no ga ima dewa, "Money makin'"
Atari mae no you ni time's racing
Dakedo ano koro no
Days, remember?

[Illmari] I remember kake meguru omoide
Koko de hodoite
Gutto kuruyou na omoide
Nagamete mae no hou ga poi ze
Choice is yours, na no ni poison
Erabu no wa doshite
Kimi ni moshi deru I still love
H-E-R
Tell me why
Hoka no ko wa hayari de Passin' Me By
Shiteku kedo kimi dake only one
Do what you like
If that's your style
Sonna ima no kimi to odottetai

Kore ga hajimaridatte
Remember, kimi wa Hanto E. Rap

Repeat Pre-Chorus

Repeat Chorus

[Kanye West]
I know

[Verse 3: Kanye West]
This is what y'all all looking forward to
This is more than historical, anything that I say that is audible
Ought to blow, just like a chick givin' oral, yo
Lick the black, get the cream, like a Oreo
Hit the track, get the C.R.E.A.M., same story, yo
Trick that on Armani Emporium, it's more important, though
Yes sir, my aura is orchestral, but way fresher
'Cause I simply throw a symphony, on a SMPTE, but I know
That niggas steal beats, so after I emcee, I empty the M.P
So I can stay out of reach, they used to say, "You'se a producer"
I'm glad I never listened to you losers, cause now, I'm in
Shibuya, buyin' somethin that's, way too exclusive
Uh, ra-ra-ra-ra-rappers are in danger, this floor is from a manger
But meaner than Lucifer, yeah, and this is the new drug
I'm the new high, y'all want ya weed back?
Yell, "I still love H.E.R., Hanto E. Rap!" (E. Rap...)
E. Rap

Repeat Chorus

[Verbal]
Alright
