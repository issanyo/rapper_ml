[Intro: Mykki Blanco]
Work this pussy, work this pussy, work this pussy
Work this pussy, work this pussy, work this pussy
Work this pussy, work this pussy, work this pussy
Work this pussy, work this pussy, work this pussy
Work this pussy, work this pussy, work this pussy
Work this pussy, work this pussy, work this pussy
Work this pussy, work this pussy, work this pussy
She's a motherfucking international sensation
She's not your average showgirl
Allow Miss Taylor to sing the blues

[Chorus: Teyana Taylor]
I'm still, I'm still wet here tonight
So I will make you cum through the night
Will you touch me? Will you go deep in me?
I will in the sheets
I will, I will, I-I-I will

[Spoken Interlude: Mykki Blanco]
She’s a mother fuckin’ international sensation
She’s not your average show girl
Allow Miss Taylor to sing the blues

[Chorus: Teyana Taylor]
I'm still, I'm still wet here tonight
So I will make you cum through the night
Will you touch me? Will you go deep in me?
I will in the sheets
I will, I will, I-I-I will

Work this pussy, work this pussy, work this pussy
Work this pussy, work this pussy, work this pussy
Work this pussy, work this pussy

[Spoken Interlude: Mykki Blanco]
Save your tears honey
You’re a mother fucking diva
These banjee cunts can’t take you, Miss Taylor

[Outro from "Paris Is Burning" & Teyana Taylor]
I believe that there's a big future out there with a lot of beautiful things
I want so much more I want, I want my name to be a household product in the high fashion world
