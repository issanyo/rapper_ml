[Intro]
Uh, yeah
Uh, uh

[Refrain]
Hopped off the Amistad and made "I'm A God"
It's always a lituation when I'm involved
It's always a lituation when I'm involved

[Verse 1]
Parents are the strippers, strip kids of they confidence
Teach white dominance, question your common sense

[Refrain]
Hopped off the Amistad and made "I'm A God"
It's always a lituation when I'm involved
See, I say what they say when the mic is off
