Ay Grav, didn't you use to mess with those girls over there right there?
Oh yeah man she loves mad moanin'!
Ha! You know what I'm sayin'? Aight?

Yo premonitions of the mission of this hun that I was lookin' for
Now whores come in scores but this girl had more in store
My foot taps floors as I be in different realms of deep thought
Thinking of how I got caught
We made an even trade
I got the skins while the hottie got played
At least that's what I thought but it seems that my heart's been taken, been took
Cause as I proceed to look through my black book
Name after name, everything looks the same
Seems that the whole situation's gotten lame
Start to question if I can survive in this state of mind where her face keeps on arrivin'
She says (Boy you said you loved me)
I do! (You can't; the only time you want me's when I'm pullin' down my pants)
Well monkey see monkey do, you do me then I'll do you
Girl I'm just teasin' what's the reason for the treason?
(Seems I caught you skeezin') Now girl, what the hell?
(Do the names Tonya and Tameka ring a bell?)
Now my train of thought starts streakin' when a bo like me starts thinkin' of some shit like this here:
Honey you be's the one I wanna be's with when I do birds and bees (Whatever)
But sometimes it be's like that, one of her girls be on up on these, 'cause my shit's fat (fat-ass nigga!)
But the next like she relays on the phone is dial tone, now a nigga chillin' all alone
But I guess since my name's Gravity relationships are bound to go up and then come down

I thought it was on
(I thought you knew this shit was on)
I thought it was on
(I thought you knew this shit was on)
I thought it was on
(I thought you knew this shit was on)
I thought it was on
(Nigga you thought wrong)
I thought it was on
(I thought you knew this shit was on)
I thought it was on
(I thought you knew this shit was on)
I thought it was on
(I thought you knew this shit was on)
I thought it was on
(Nigga you thought wrong)

Yo now nobody really knows all of the trouble I've seen since then
It's been about three years but man I never thought I'd see your girl again
But to my surprise, seen her at a party I could tell by the eyes, hips, and the thick thighs
Could have swore she still had feelings, yo
She even sported a dress I bought her years ago
Now this had to be that girl, Lord knows that I was wishin'
Collect my courage, put my mind on the mission
Of fulfillin' my dream of me playin' the role of a king, she could be my lovely black queen
Tapped her on the shoulder, "Yo miss, how do you do, do you remember me, because I remember you
It was back in September of '92" (Um, I think so, ain't your name Drew?)
Well God damn girl, you got the memory of an elephant
Let's start anew yo the past is irrelevant
Grab her by the hand, ask honey to dance
Thank God for givin' brothers a second chance
But somethin' wasn't right, y'all it just wasn't the same
She didn't have a problem with me spittin' her game
But I tried to ignore that fact that somethin' was wrong
Cause the thought feelin' was strong
All night she kept grabbin' me
It was too quick to be havin' me, she didn't want Drew, she wanted Gravity
So now she's makin' tracks y'all, with two off the loosky, same sample that we call groupie
It hit my heart, yo it cut like a knife
I created a monster that was now livin' trife
The old girl had to go, now there's only holy matrimony to my flow

It could have been on
(I thought you knew this shit was on)
(I thought it was on)
(I thought you knew this shit was on)
(I thought it was on)
(I thought you knew this shit was on)
(I thought it was on)
(I thought you knew this shit was on)
(I thought it was on)
(I thought you knew this shit was on)
(I thought it was on)
(I thought you knew this shit was on)
(I thought it was on)
(I thought you knew this shit was on)
(I thought it was on)
(I thought you knew this shit was on)

(Know what I'm sayin', shorty was straight playin' herself, right?)

(Fat-ass nigga!)
