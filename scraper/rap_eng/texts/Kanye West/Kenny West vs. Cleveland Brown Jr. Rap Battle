[Verse 1: Kanye West]
It's Kenny sippin' Henny, rhymes slicker than Teflon
At Stoolbend High, I'm the black Zac Efron
And when I meet a shorty, you know, we're goin' backwards
Pullin' more tail than my man, John Edwards
Lumpy, chunky, booger-eatin' chump be
Actin' outta place like Hootie singin' country!
Leave my girl alone and get your own tenderoni
C'mon, who are we kidding?
You're used to being lonely

[Verse 2: Kevin Michael Richardson]
I need to say something here
Eh, hello, can you hear me?
A-B-C-D-E-F-G, someone should've told you not to fuck with me!

You think you can rhyme, man?
Your flow was amateur
I'm a nerd! I can smoke you with iambic pentameter!
Mess with me, homeboy, don't wanna risk it
I'll burn you like Mrs. Friedman's god-awful brisket
Yeah, how you like me now, bitch?

[Verse 3: Kanye West]
Fall back, big boy, cuz ya steppin' to the best
Kenny West, test, test, test!
Yo, is this thing on?
Qach. yo’ baq HIch qaq!
Yeah, I just dissed you in Klingon

[Verse 4: Kevin Michael Richardson]
NuqDaq pa’ ra’ qa', yeah, I speak Klingon, too
So kiss my chocolate ghunta', and also, HaH you!
Your flow is faded, dated, deflated, and constipated
If I had to rate it? Hate it!
Translated? You ate it!
Hey, cheeseball, you've been grated
Chewed up, swallowed, and defecated
Ha! To restate it, on the DVD, this won't be pixelated

[Kanye West]
Alright, alright, I know you think you so hot
Question is, can you sing like a robot?

[Kevin Michael Richardson]
Yes, I can sing like a robot

[Kanye West]
Now, y'all just witness history in the makin'

[Kevin Michael Richardson]
Greatest combination since eggs and bacon

[Kanye West]
Kenny West and Cleveland Jr. Brown!

[Kevin Michael Richardson]
Let's get up...

[Kanye West & Kevin Michael Richardson]
And burn this mutha down!
