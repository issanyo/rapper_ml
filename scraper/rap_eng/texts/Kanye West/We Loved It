[Seal]
Come sweetly, stab me through the shadow of an open door
Wait quietly now, take us to the helplessness of it all
And I wonder as I watch you slip away somehow
Wonder if the only thing left is love
Wonder if I ever will wait

[Hook]
Will I ever love again?
Will I ever love again?

[John Legend]
Oh, lie to me
Lie to me, tell me I'm not wasting time
Yeah, yeah
Oh, oh, convince me you miss me
Your heart still beats as fast as mine
Tell me lies
We loved it, loved it even more than we knew
We lost it, and I don't even know what to do
Tell me what to do
Cause I wonder why it had to slip away somehow
I wonder if you'll ever wanna see me now
I wonder if I'll ever be the same

[Hook]
Will I ever love again?
Will I ever love again?


[Bridge]
Oh, you eyes haunt me, taunt me, pierce straight through my heart again
Will it ever end?
Cause I

[Seal + John Legend]
Wonder as I watch you slip away somehow
I wonder if you ever wanna see me now
I wonder if I'll ever wait

[Hook]
Will I ever love again?
Will I ever love again?
