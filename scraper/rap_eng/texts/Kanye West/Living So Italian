[Intro: Andrea Bocelli & JAY-Z]
Por ti volaré
Hov just landed in Rome, nigga
Espera que llegaré
All hail, Caesar's home, niggas
Mi fin de trayecto eres tú
Chin Don, ciao bella
Para vivirlo-
Come money dance with the good fellas

[Verse: JAY-Z]
Hov keep gettin' that dinero, got it
Even if a nigga gotta rob it, get it?
Black Jack in a casino
A nigga got unlimited credit, uh
A nigga got a lot of vendettas, uh
But we the Black mob, we gonna set it, uh
Peel off in a Lamborghini Countach
200 in the dash, we gonna rev it, skrrt
Lucky Luciano is what they call me, paesano
A 100 keys at the piano
Plays across the Verrazano
El Padrino, in the villa in Venice, sippin' vino
Not bad for a mulignan
Y'all know like we know, I got it
