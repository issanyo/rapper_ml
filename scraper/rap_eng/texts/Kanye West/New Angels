[Hook]
New angels still learning how to fly
Still learning how to fly
And lay your love on the line
New angels
Who will make the sacrifice?
Who will make the sacrifice?
And lay your love on the line

[Verse 1]
Forget everything that you know
You're way too far from home
Hollow sign for kingdom
And you're ready, you're ready, you're ready
To hold on to [?]
Poppin' [?]
Having to run the game over
Ready she ready, she ready, she ready

[Hook]
The new angel
Still learning how to fly
Still learning how to fly
And lay your love on the line
New angel
Who will make the sacrifice?
Who will make the sacrifice?
And lay your love on the line

[Verse 2]
Hollow [?] I can't love
Hell if I, hell if I know
Hell if I, hell if I know
Love and the [?]

Act like youâ€™ve met me before
Swear that she met him before

Holdin' and [?] it on

You knew it
