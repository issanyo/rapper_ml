[Verse 1]
A little trouble in the city
Trouble in my home
She told me love don't live here anymore
I wanna run to the light
It's too dark in this part of night
I need somebody who can make it right

[Hook]
And it's on tonight
How about we go and save the night
I can see you want it and so do i
How about we go and save the night
Let's save the night

[Verse 2]
I'm not a one man band
I want to sing a duet
You and me would sound much better
You look so good in my bed
And if your gonna go out
Your gonna go out with a bang
Let's save the night i'll be your superman

[Hook]

[Bridge]
I see the night flashing before her eyes
Resuscitating bring it back to life

[Hook]
