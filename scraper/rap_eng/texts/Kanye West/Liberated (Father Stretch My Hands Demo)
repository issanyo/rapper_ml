[Pre-Chorus: Kanye West]
Who can I make that them better right now?
Who, oh I know that'll make it better right now?
Who do I know that'll make 'em better right now?
Who do you know?

[Chorus: Kanye West]
I just wanna feel liberated I, I, I
I just wanna feel liberated I, I, I
If I ever instigated I, I
Tell me who will never related, I

[Verse: Kendrick Lamar]
Annie, are you okay? Ooh, yeah (ooh, la-la)
Annie, are you okay? Ooh, yeah
Do you like foreplay? Ooh, yeah
Do you go both ways? I really need confirmation
Your love is abomination, fucking you is like a bomb of nations
Area 51 in that pussy, ah
The president 'bout to cum in that pussy, ah
I got mind control, I got dick control
I reel 'em in for the fishing pole
I love legs like Robyn Fenty
Stretch them shits like limo Bentleys
Catch them tits with an open mouth
The interview up outta that Oprah house
You know I love it when it's pokin' out
You know I'm thuggin' even in the drought, you know him
I fuck around and crash a brand new Bugatti
In the mothafuckin' lobby so you know I'm in it better
Won't you kiss it, baby? Take a picture
I, I, I, I, I'm killin' em
Illuminati want my money and my body
Even Donny rollin' by me, looking aggravated that I made it
Fuck you and your mama, nigga
I, I, I, I, I see the bitch in them, I got the Benjamin
I got the dividend, I'm on my toes like Serena at the Wimbledon
Pie Ã  la mode on a Monday for my woman-friend
I'm in the mode of a mortal man
I'm living in the orbit of deliverin'
Sex in a cathedral, empty, Grand Marnier that I reload, ten Gs
In the hallway, she a Leo, I'm a Gemini
Give me mine, genocide, kill 'em all, thirty times

[Pre-Chorus: Kanye West]
Who can I make that them better right now?
Who, oh I know that'll make it better right now?
Who do I know that'll make 'em better right now?
Who do you know?

[Chorus: Kanye West]
I just wanna feel liberated I, I, I
I just wanna feel liberated I, I, I
If I ever instigated I, I
Tell me who will never related, I

[Outro: Kanye West]
Why I fucked you this evening
At Southside, live for these things
By the way, how you feelin', forgot
I don't give a fuck about your family and that, oh
Back it up, back it up, oh oh
Back it up, back it up, oh oh
Back it up, back it up, oh oh
Back it up, yeah
