[Verse 1: Cassidy]
I used to pump dimes, now I spit punchlines
I'm tired of cats trying to rap cause they want shine
I be writing to enlighten those that was once blind
This political warfare, and I'm on the front line
I'm a soldier who grew to be a general, but generals is soldiers too
And I'm willing to do what soldiers do
But you know an animal can't control a zoo
And I always been a leader, I control my crew
You gotta school other dudes trying to roll with you
And I'm getting more mature, I'm getting older too
But I'ma rock 'till it's over like Hova do
And I don't tell lies like most of you
I really did sell pies, held toasters too
I might exaggerate a little but it's mostly true
And the truth come to the light like it's supposed to do

[Chorus: John Legend]
Dance little brother, don't give up the fight
Hang on 'till tomorrow, the truth will come to light
Dance little sister, don't give up the day
Hang on 'till tomorrow, tonight we celebrate, celebrate

[Verse 2: Cassidy]
Get the obituary ready, get the Reverend
My old style died, and went to punchline Heaven
You cats know that that's my flow, I'm a legend
Big up John Legend for doing the song
Aye, wha a gwaan Kanye
I ain't a Juvenile, but I been on the grind-ye
I had a murder case, I was facing some time-yee
But that's something small to a giant like Andre
And they was talking 'bout giving me life, y'all
But I knew I was leaving for believing in Christ
Y'all, you could live it up, but don't give up the fight, y'all
We elevating, so we celebrating the night, y'all

[Chorus: John Legend]
Dance little brother, don't give up the fight
Hang on 'till tomorrow, the truth will come to light
Dance little sister, don't give up the day
Hang on 'till tomorrow, tonight we celebrate, celebrate

[Verse 3: Cassidy]
Hang on lil' girl
Soon all your troubles will be gone lil' girl
Sometimes you probably wish you wasn't born lil' girl
But God know what he doin', lil' girl, so keep fighting
And hang on lil' man
You can't quit now, keep goin' lil' man
Sometimes you probably wish you wasn't born lil' man
But God know what he doin' lil' man, so keep fighting

[Chorus: John Legend]
Dance little brother, don't give up the fight
Hang on 'till tomorrow, the truth will come to light
Dance little sister, don't give up the day
Hang on 'till tomorrow, tonight we celebrate, celebrate
