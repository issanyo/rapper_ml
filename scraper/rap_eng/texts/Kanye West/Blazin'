I fly, I fly high, I’m blazin', I’m blazin', feels like I’m blazin'
I fly, I fly high, I’m blazin', I’m blazin', feels like I’m blazin'
Feels like I’m–

[Verse 1: Nicki Minaj]
How could it be, little me
Had the power to be the best B, in the league
Yeah, inevitably, but could it belittle me?
You was heckling me, now it’s monotony winning regularly
I catch rec on recreation, so I exceed all your expectations
Bitches ain't got it in ‘em, I kill ‘em and then I skin ‘em
The contract was signed, but I am the addendum
So wh-where my dawgs at, Randy
Ma-ma-matter fact, get off my dick bitch, Andy
Ca-ca-ca-cause everything is fine and dandy
Go against me nooooow, I dare you, Bambi
Half a million dollars just to upgrade the car show
I ain't even detonate the bombs in the arsenal
Before the storm comes the calm
Hope you can take the heat like LeBron
Ahh, ha hahahaha ha
I’m the best now, anybody with some money should invest now
Soccer moms need to organize a pep rall’
Your game over bitch, Gatorade, wet towel
Mothafuckers ain't ready, they neva' been
As long as I am in the game, you’ll never win
I’m on that different type of high, heroin
Put on my cape and hit the sky, heroine!

I fly, I fly high, I’m blazin', I’m blazin', feels like I’m blazin'

Feels like I’m–
I fly, I fly high, I’m blazin', I’m blazin', feels like I’m blazin'
I fly, I fly high, I’m blazin', I’m blazin', feels like I’m blazin'

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
This is the moment, grab your Kodak
While I’m flying with a flow that is
The greatest throwback since that Nolan Ryan
And the days been crazy and the nights even wilder
And the lights even brighter, baby, stand next to my fire
Only higher is Messiah or notes from Mariah
‘Rari six hundred horses, that’s my chariot of fire?
Where we flying, they can’t find us all them broke days behind us
I just took your whole life and redesigned it
I think I’m Marc Jacobs, I think I’m Lagerfeld
I think without makeup, you still bad as hell
I'mma grab your waist then, I'mma grab your face and
Then I'mma taste it, then I'mma blaze it
Hello all my bad girls, this just in
Yeezy hurt the beat like he fucked her best friend
And she let him back in, and he just did it again
He crazy, he blazin, he off the deep end
I’m blazin’, I’m flagrant, I'm crazy, I’m saying
Too much for the World so they abbreviate him
His past is her fav, his stats is amaze
Her dress is just per’, uhh
Prada coloured beige
It obvi’ we the ish and I’m rolling with my Brits
So real, you so trill, baby, everything legit
How you feel? They say we crazed 'cause our styles so diff’
They'll be jeal' when we in the mag looking magnif’
As if I ain't used Magnums on your favorite bad bitch
Fuck these background niggas, I was tryna ad-lib
Add this, we blazin’
Nicki what you think? I got two White Russians, but we also need some drinks
