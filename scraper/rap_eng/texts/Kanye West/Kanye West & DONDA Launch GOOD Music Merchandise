Kanye West and his creative enterprise DONDA have officially launched the GOOD Music Merchandise online store featuring multiple designs on everything from socks to snapbacks. After recently opening the Yeezus Tour Pop-Up Shop (curiously placed right next to the Kardashian trio's "D-A-S-H" store), Yeezus has dropped a whole new line of merchandise in support of his record label and newest enterprise in DONDA. The GOOD Music merchandise online store features all black and white items and some of the merchandise has even been worn by Yeezy himself.


Recently, West spoke in an interview with Power 106's Big Boy Neighborhood denouncing high-fashion company Louis-Vuitton claiming their prices were "too extreme."

"If I had the opportunity to design for Louis Vuitton now I wouldn’t, because the prices are just too extreme,” said West. “I don’t want to use my message to have kids saving up that much to be a part of what the ideas are. That’s the problem to me with luxury.”

West's desires to keep prices more affordable and "less extreme" shows in his recent ventures with both the GOOD Music store and his collaboration with PacSun and Wes Lang that offers Yeezus Tour shirts for $40 per shirt. Merchandise from the GOOD Music store ranges from $34-$160 (plus shipping and handling.) His less recent collaboration with A.P.C. has also been considered more "accessible."
