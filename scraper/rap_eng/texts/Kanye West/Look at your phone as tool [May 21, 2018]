Look at your phone as tool not an obligation.    Would you walk around with a hammer in your pocket?    You would pick up a hammer when you needed it   you would never be addicted or obligated to it.  Use your phone like a hammer only pick it up when you need it.

there was a time when we completely operated without phones.  We're addicted to our phones.

the century of self   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJ3RzGoQC4s …        It’s 4 hours long but you’ll get the gist in the first 20 minutes      Basically Sigmund Frued’s nephew Edward Bernays capitalized off of his uncle’s philosophies and created modern day consumerism

before Edward Bernays Americans purchased things based off needs       There was a a time in the 20s when women didn’t smoke in public so Edward Bernays masterminded a campaign to make it culturally acceptable so that companies could sell more cigarettes..it’s that kind of vibe..
