[Verse 1: Madonna & Natalia Kills]
I can give you everything that you want
(Bitch, get off my pole)
(Bitch, get off my pole)
You can't buy this at no luxury store
(Bitch, get off my pole)
(Bitch, get off my pole)

[Pre-Chorus 1: Madonna]
There's a place you gotta go
Before I let you take it all
It's like a drug, it should be illegal
Baby, you should get down low
And drink my precious alcohol
You look so thirsty, I think you need it

[Chorus: Natalia Kills & Madonna]
Kiss it better, kiss it better
Don't it taste like holy water?
Make it wetter, make it wetter
Don't it taste like holy water?
Kiss it better, make it wetter
Don't it taste like holy water?
Kiss it better, kiss it better

[Verse 2: Madonna & Natalia Kills]
I can teach you all the things you don't know
(Bitch, get off my pole)
(Bitch, get off my pole)
It's rare like mink, it's something you wanna own
(Bitch, get off my pole)
(Bitch, get off my pole)

[Pre-Chorus 2: Madonna]
There's something you gotta hit
It's sacred and immaculate
I can let you in heavenâ€™s door
I promise you it's not a sin
Find salvation deep within
We can do it here on the floor

[Chorus: Natalia Kills & Madonna]
Kiss it better, kiss it better
Don't it taste like holy water?
Make it wetter, make it wetter
Don't it taste like holy water?
Kiss it better, make it wetter
Don't it taste like holy water?
Kiss it better, kiss it better

[Bridge: Madonna]
Don't it taste like holy water, like holy water?
Don't it taste like holy water?
Bless yourself and genuflect
Don't it taste like holy water, like holy water?
Don't it taste like holy water?
If you like it, please confess
Don't it taste like holy water, like holy water?
Don't it taste like holy water?
Bless yourself and genuflect
Don't it taste like holy water, like holy water?
Don't it taste like holy water?
Yeezus loves my pussy best

[Interlude: "Vogue" Sample]
Ladies with an attitude
Don't just stand there
Don't-don't, don't just stand there
Don't just stand there, let's get to it
Strike a pose, there's nothin' to it

[Pre-Chorus 2: Madonna]
There's something you gotta hit
It's sacred and immaculate
I can let you in heaven's door
I promise you it's not a sin
Find salvation deep within
We can do it here on the floor

[Chorus: Natalia Kills & Madonna]
Kiss it better, kiss it better
Don't it taste like holy water?
Make it wetter, make it wetter
Don't it taste like holy water?
Kiss it better, make it wetter
Don't it taste like holy water?
Kiss it better, kiss it better

[Outro: Madonna]
Don't it taste like holy water, like holy water?
Do-don't it taste like holy water?
Bless yourself and genuflect
Don't it taste like holy water, like holy water?
Do-don't it taste like holy water?
Yeezus loves my pussy best
Don't it taste like holy water, like holy water?
Do-don't it taste like holy water?
Bless yourself and genuflect
Don't it taste like holy water, like holy water?
Do-don't it taste like holy water?
Yeezus loves my pussy best
