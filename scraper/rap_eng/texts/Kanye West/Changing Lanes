[Kanye West]
And you say Chi city
And you say Chi city
I'm down with Chops in Philly
Nothin' really just to Roc, me, Free and Mac Milli

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Listen, yo
I drove to New York with ten dollars to my name
Brought back a couple platinum plaques on a plane
Brought back the soul to change the game
Had a little beef I had to aim, it's stainless steel
The lyrics in my heart I can't restrain they real
I swear to God I wish I had a dollar bill
For every time a nigga told me stick to the beats
I could have ate at Cheesecake at least six times a week
Plus I'm killin' these niggas on that lyrical shit
Mayonnaise colored Benz I push miracle whips
Dawg I'm killin' these niggas on that lyrical shit
Mayonnaise colored Benz I push miracle whips
Changing lanes
Yeah, I'm changing lanes

[Verse 2: Chops]
And you say West Philly
And you say West Philly
I'm down with Kanye and Chi City
Nothing really, just Chops with beats to smack you silly
Listen

Let it be said and let it be known: without a touch of ego
The Chops is out your league like Pete Rose
To see most of these Joe's that make beats
Their flows is type-weak yo, like Shaq on the free throw
The difference between them and me though
Is similar to Big Pun and Suave Rico
Cause they beef oh, artificial like insemination - in vitro
When I bust like a depot, I be colder than December when the heat cold
Cool breeze leave the street froze
Quantum leap over these freak shows, I be unique yo
And check the stink, it fucking reeks so
Instead of making money, making music, that's the creed oh
On the D-low stack chips and lay like Frito's
Instead of making money, making music, that's the creed oh
On the D-low stack chips and lay like Frito's
Changing lanes
