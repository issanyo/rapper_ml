[Verse One: Kanye West]
And I’m back in a major way
And she's singing like Jamaicans say
"Waa daa dang, waa daata daata dang
That nigga got a whole lot of chains
And a whip, and a boat like a slave
And he hopping out the motherfucking Range
Why’s she getting so amped?
Cause I'm sucking on her neck like a vamp
You can feel the fangs
And she looking at my phone book like "Ayo
You got a whole lot of names."
And I’m looking at your phone book like, "Hey yo
You got a whole lot of lames."
That’s why is time to switch lanes
Cause before us it's also the same
So far, before Joistarr
And that’s why I got my favorite chick sang

[Hook: Joistarr]
I want you to be my lover
I want you to be my friend at the
At the same time
Don’t need one more than the other
I need both of him at the
At the same time

[Verse Two: Joistarr]
You are not from here
Baby, take me out
Baby, show me around
I could tell you are not from here either
I mean you want something else
I perceive all the rest, oh yes!

[Hook]

[Verse Three: Joistarr]
I’m waiting for the weekend cause…
OK, we’ll be children, so…
That you’re my homie
But I want you to have all of me!

[Hook]

[Verse Four: Joistarr]
Hey, boy you know I feel the way I do
I’m so gone
I want you, I wanna kiss in my …
In my dress, in my chest
In my heels
Isn’t me that you feel cause I

[Hook]
