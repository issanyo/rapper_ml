[Verse 1: Un Casa]
It's a shame how I rap so bananas
It's Mr. Two-Gun Un
Motherfuckers better cock back them hammers
You might catch me in the drop blowin pop with Santana
The hawk on me's not from Atlanta
It's just the father to the Glocks in the hamper
Look in the rear view the cops in the camera
I flow hot like blocks down in Tampa
And leave you dead pop shot from them blammers
And go down south and rock wit them bamas
And come back in the Porsche color hot banana
Vanilla coat seats piper made by Tropicana
Speakers do the wop rims do the Macerana
This is Taliban Dipset Roc-A-Fella
It ain't nuthin for Two-Gun to pop a fella
Killa signed me now I got the mozerella
I promised Hell Rell Un Cas gon' rock forever

[Interlude: Un Casa (Cam'ron)]
What's really good Flee what's really good
(Aiight flee I mean that, that that's what's really good
I can't front)
Well what's really good can I finish
(I mean I mean what's really good hold up Two-Gun
I'ma let you finish I mean what's really really good now)
What's really good
(I mean what's really good)
What's really good
(I mean you did your thing I'm with you what's really good
Let's finish up let's right what's really good)

[Verse 2: Un Casa]
Yo I'm livin' in the equinox
Niggas eat with Glocks
Enough steel it'll cease the block
Add yeast to increase the rock
I got knowledge that can teach my pops
Watch my pockets increase with knots
Play the low so I speak to cops
Walk the beat in my bop in my beef and brocs
Ice in my piece an watch
Ain't too many niggas that can reach the top
Or speak this hot
Peep this pop I leave you not
I rhyme over beats with the meanest drops
And teens'll flock
Seen my spot, seen my prop
Ran when you seen the cops
Got your wife sucking semen cocks
I'ma Taliban lyrical monster
They'll shout a city I conquer
White Ice cinnamon Parker
Al Qaeda's most vividest author
Hundred thou just ta glitter the charm up
45th sides grittiest monster
The truck look like the city of Tonka
Dame here ta say this nigga is bonkers
Whoa far as the flow I'm the realest nigga spittin' it
Niggas talk hustle game but I'm really gettin' it
Anything I want an need nigga I'm gettin' it
745 Gucci top with the stick in it
The ice is so clear like the shit fishes swimmin' in
I ain't Diddy y'all but I'm strictly for the benjamins
I'm the boss I ain't dealin' with you middle men
Bout ta cop a Yukon white made in cinnamon

[Outro: Un Casa (Cam'ron)]
Niggas get y'all fuckin' car game up
(Diplomats, that's what's really fuckin' good)
