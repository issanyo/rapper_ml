[Intro: CyHi The Prynce]
Where all my real ones at?
Hey!

[Chorus: CyHi The Prynce]
All the haters stand on dat side
All the suckas stand on dat side
All the lames stand on dat side
All the bustas stand on dat side, dat side, dat side, dat side
All the haters stand on dat side
All the suckas stand on dat side
All the lames stand on dat side
Dat side, dat side, dat side, dat side, dat side

[Verse 1: CyHi The Prynce]
Got two bitches bumping clits, that's a cat fight
I'm ridin' with the stick, that's that act right
In here with all my jewels like I'm a Rabbi
Zone 6, East Atlanta, I'm from that side
Uhh, I asked the plug for a kilo
He hit me with a brick like I'm Deebo
Hah, I charged the high for the zero
But we gon' keep that on the D-low
Hah, assault rifle with the peephole
It go A-B-A-B-B-B, Mortal Kombat cheat code
And I'm in here with my chico
Might get you whacked, you standing three close
So

[Chorus: CyHi The Prynce]
All the haters stand on dat side
All the suckers stand on dat side
All the lames stand on dat side
All the bustas stand on dat side, dat side, dat side, dat side
All the haters stand on dat side
All the suckers stand on dat side
All the lames stand on that side
Dat side, dat side, dat side, dat side, dat side

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
All the haters hating, wait a minute, stand on dat side
I don't need no allies, I don't feel the need to fraternize
Yeezys in the field, Yeezys, Yeezys in the field now
Made it to the NBA, we in the NFL now
All the haters hating, wait a minute, stand on dat side
Moved into a neighborhood where I'm the only black guy
People claim they praying for you, really, they be preying on you
All this shit is weighing on you, don't look back, they gaining on you
"'Ye, look down, they aiming for you, all this shit is draining on you
And the people claim to know you, put 'em on, get famous on you
Then they go and blame it on you, you just good, they can't ignore you"
Don't respect who came before 'em and made they lane so I
Pulled a Lambo out and then I went and got it baptized
Moved into a neighborhood where I'm the only black guy
Neighbors said they think I gave the neighborhood a black eye
They too worried 'bout what I'm doing so I gotta keep my grass high

[Chorus: CyHi The Prynce]
(Dat right, dat right, dat right, dat right, dat right)
All the haters stand on dat side
All the suckas stand on dat side
All the lames stand on dat side
Dat side, dat side, dat side, dat side, dat side

[Verse 3: CyHi The Prynce]
I'm so anti, I'm so, I'm so anti
Seen my buddy passout, I'm careful who I stand by
All you do is tell stories, you a campfire
You can barely hold your water, you a damn liar
Look at all the haters who came out to see him
I'm fresh to death, my closet is a mausoleum
They don't like I'm always hopping out of BM's
They don't know how many times I coulda loss my freedom
Went from open mics to rocking coliseums
I just bought your bitch a flight with my per diem
But I would never invite that hoe to my museum
I'm gone by 12 o'clock PM, that just how I treat 'em
So tell them groupie bitches stand on that side
I call these niggas groupies too cause that what niggas act like
Stand on that side, I don't need your advice
Spit my trap like moving weight, I'm a fat guy
Wait, I just wanna see my paper stack like that high
Wait, my girl waist a 28, I like 'em that size
Wait, and them cakes a 38, I like 'em that wide
They ask why I was late, I pointed down and told 'em, "That's why"

[Chorus: CyHi The Prynce]
All the haters stand on dat side
All the suckers stand on dat side
All the lames stand on dat side
Dat side, dat side, dat side, dat side, dat side
