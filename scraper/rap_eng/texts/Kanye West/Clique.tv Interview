Mouloud Achour: I always wondered, when we were talking with Jean, he was saying that it was hard for you to get into this "fashion world", and you were saying it was hard for Michael Jackson to put his videos on MTV. And I don't realise, how much a guy like you, that I listen to everyday, I watch everyday, and influences the use - everytime you do something, people wanna do it. So how is it possible that the big houses don't understand that?

Kanye: The thought was that everything popular was very basic and not complex and the negative connotation of commercial. So soon as you're commercial, you don't have the complexity of a Bach, a Mozart, a Basquiat, and if you say out loud as a commercial person that you're in the same breath as Basquiat, then everyone looks at you like you're an egomaniac or something. But then you'll be like, wait a second, you know I was a gifted artist since age 5, and like in national competitions and went to art school. I'm actually getting an honorary doctorate on May 5th from the Art Institute of Chicago so, it was a great wall to break down

But also, what's fun about playing in the pop field versus the art field is you get a lot of exposure and the majority of the pop artists don't have the same responsibility to the sensibility so it's easy to slam dunk them. To hit that BRIT Awards performance super hard against everything else that's going on. And, but I want all the best for all of the pop stars. I want all of us to have as inspiring of performances as possible. I think it's important, you know, our point of references, we need to study Fellini and Jodorowsky, Corbusier, and the different information that I've got from living out here with Paris, hanging out with Jean, and going to the French flea market and everything, that constant information, education, education is the power
