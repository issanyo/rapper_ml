[Hook]
Our love's an asylum
Where you and I go
Our love's an asylum
Where we go, go, go, go crazy

[Verse 1]
In a state of madness
Wrapped up in your magic
Ecstatic, an addict
Oh we've landed
On another planet
And it feels like home here
We'll never go back there
Cause we're crazy
I'll go crazy with you
You're so crazy
I'll go crazy with you

[Hook] x2

[Verse 2]
Can't nobody save me
I'll go down with you, baby
I'll take you, you'll take me
Crazy - I'll do crazy with you
Let's go crazy, I'll go crazy with you

[Hook]
