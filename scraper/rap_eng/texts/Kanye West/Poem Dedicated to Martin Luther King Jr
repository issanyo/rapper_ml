A man who fought for freedom
A man who fought for equality
Those who were against him
Were too blind to see
What this man was fighting for
So Blacks, Hispanics, Jews and Asians could put their foot in the door
Yes, we know that this man is great
That's why today we celebrate
Everyone lifts their voice and sing
For a man who wanted freedom to ring
Martin Luther King is who I'm speaking of
A man whose name means love
