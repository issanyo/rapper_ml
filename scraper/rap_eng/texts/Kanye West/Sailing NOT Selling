[Verse 1: Jhene]
See I got a lot to say
And I ain't afraid to say it
Mind on money so it's why I'm tryin' to make it
Yeah, but the money's what you make it
Let it make you see where it's gon' take ya
Hey, you'll be headed nowhere
Moving so fast you won't even care
Yeah, but when you get there
What you gon' do when nobody's there?
Ay, I know what you're gonna say
Made it there alone so you don't worry 'bout they
Hey, but when it all goes away
You gonna be stuck so what I'm tryna say is
Don't lose your

[Hook]
Soul
Oh, Let go, let go of your ego
Don't lose your soul
Sail your soul
Sailing soul

[Verse 2: Jhene]
Is it really worth it?
You are only hurting yourself
You will never grow if you lose control over yourself
(Don't let go)
If you don't get a hold of yourself
Then you will end up with no self
You're Playing the game for the fame in the end
But what do you gain when you're paying to win?
You don't
You better keep your soul
Set sail or get sold, oh

[Verse 3: Kanye]
I sold my soul to the devil thats a crappy deal
Least it came with a few toys like a happy meal
This game you could never win
Cause they love you then they hate you then they love you again
Get away from me loneliness
Get away from me misery
Get away from me fake bitches, I can’t take the phoniness
Get away from me whack tracks
I can only make only hits
I’m an only child lost in the World
Where did the lonely kids go when the bell rings
It's feeling like hell rings
Bringing me back down
He's checking my background
It's ironic whats happening, imagine if I didn’t have the ends
I wouldn't have so many imaginary friends
I’m spaced out dog, I be on that Moon talk
Wonder if God ask Mike how to moonwalk
I swear to momma wish me and my father talk more
I stopped visiting around the time I was a sophomore
I guess everything I hate about me I see in him
And I ain’t finna change, so we'll never agree again
Just a few things pouring out my soul
Rosewood, we can see out with our eyes closed
G.O.O.D. Music
