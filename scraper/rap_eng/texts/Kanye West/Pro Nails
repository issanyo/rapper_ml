[Hook x8]
Got her toes done up
With her finger nails matchin'

[Verse 1: Kid Sister]
Shake it up up, rock your body and
Make it knock knock, when you're partyin'
Take a break right in the audience
Do your footwork, break, and stop again
I'm lookin sharp, you can't compete with the champ
Steady flickin', I'm holdin down that layaway, rent
Put rhinestones all in they face
Gold charms and paper chase
Talk smack from around the way
Gotta put these chicken heads in they place
I ain't rockin' no stupid bapes
Ain't trippin', I'll juke all day
I ain't slippin' 'cause either way
When I hit the block, all the people say

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Aye, yo this motherfucka's jammin'; I'm on it, it's an anthem
Who is that in the Phantom? Please no cameras
They gone have me on Concrete Loop in my pajamas
To hide the goods, I would need pants big as Hammer's
I be tippin' them dancers, they be sayin' I'm handsome
I was pretty before the dough but now I'm just the man
You remind me of my old chick, on that '84 shit
Oh shit, did you see the way she got her toes did?

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Kid Sister]
Girls be so thirsty, thirsty
Fast forward to the end of my song
And say third verse me, verse me
Whenever I hit block I see
Tricks try to rehearse me, 'hearse me
From manicure sets to silky weaves
They be so grimy, nasty, bogus
Germy, dirty, uh oh
Sure did, ou ain't slick
Naw, let the pioneer blast my shit
Wait a minute, hold up
Bubble letters on my butt say "fresh"
Oops I'mma go, bails like whoa
Acrylic base, top all gold
Colors on my nails to the paint on my toes
Stay fresh, I'm accustomed to gold

[Hook]
