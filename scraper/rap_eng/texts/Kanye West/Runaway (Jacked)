[Bridge-Arie Dixon]
I never thought I'd feel
The same as that feeling that I felt when I felt about you
And all my friends know it
But they don't say it cause, I'm not the same without, you
And I can't deny it, even if I try it, shit
I know it's so true
And as crazy as it sounds, you'll never know what I go through

[Verse 1 - Arie Dixon]
I'm not gonna lie though, I'm feelin like I died slow
Sitting back like damn, where did time go
Lookin back with regeret cause I know
When you left, a part of me died slow
I kinda sorta feel defeated
I'm disappointed cause this missions incompleted
But, I can't believe that I'm free now
The noose's loose around my neck, I can breathe now
Cause, I would've told you go fuck yourself
You ain't care about shit, but yourself
Try to treat me like half a man
I should've fucked your best friend when I had the chance
Holy shit, this hoe's a trick
She tryna hit me up now like I owe her shit
Fuck that bitch, you can kiss my asshole
Because of you I am an asshole

Cause you always find, yes you always find
Bitch you always find something wrong
And i've been puttin up with your shit just way too long
Because of you

[Hook]
I'm so gifted at finding what I don't like the most
So I think it's time for us to have a toast
Let's have a toast for the douchebags
Let's have a toast for the assholes
Let's have a toast for the scumbags
Every one of them that I know
Let's have a toast for the jerkoffs
That'll never take work off
Baby, I got a plan
Run away fast as you can

[Verse 2 - Kanye West]
She find pictures in my e-mail
I sent this bitch a picture of my dick
I don't know what it is with females
But I'm not too good with that shit
See, I could have me a good girl
And still be addicted to them hoodrats
And I just blame everything on you
At least you know that's what I'm good at

[Bridge (2)- Kanye West]
Run away from me, baby, run away
Run away from me, baby, run away
It's about to get crazy, why can't she just, run away?
Baby, I got a plan, run away fast as you can

[Verse 3- Pusha T]
24/7, 365, pussy stays on my mind
I-I-I-I did it, all right, all right, I admit it
Now pick your next move, you could leave or live wit' it
Ichabod Crane with that motherfucking top off
Split and go where? Back to wearing knockoffs, haha
Knock it off, Neiman's, shop it off
Let's talk over mai tais, waitress, top it off
Hoes like vultures, wanna fly in your Freddy loafers
You can't blame 'em, they ain't never seen Versace sofas
Every bag, every blouse, every bracelet
Comes with a price tag, baby, face it
You should leave if you can't accept the basics
Plenty hoes in the balla-nigga matrix
Invisibly set, the Rolex is faceless
I'm just young, rich, and tasteless
P!
