[Verse 1: Kanye West]
I got a big ego, (hahaha)
I’m such a big ego, (uhuhuh)
I got a big, (eheheh), ego
She love my big, (eheheh), Ego
She stroke my big, (eheheh), Ego
I like to joke around a little bit but here we go
Welcome to the wonderful world
Of gold-plated Earl, cause
Everything I throw up, blow up
Talking to the girl
She said, "Know what, grow up, you nasty,"
"I don’t understand why they trippin’, if you ask me,"
Flow is just the nicest
I emit the propane
I just spit, probably
Just raised the gas prices
Everybody in the club
Try and get as fresh as me
What you want dog
Trying to stay recession free
And spit, refreshingly
When I rock the stadium
You probably get sweaty
You should bring a extra tee
Now I’m standing next to Jay
Who standing next to B
You coulda been anywhere in the world
But you’re here with me
That’s good for my ego
Me and my ego
And it go wherever we go
My ego is my imaginary friend
He was with me when I was only imagining
I had dreams of the league
One day I play Kobe
I walk up to Puff and he already know me
Coulda let the dream killers, kill my self esteem
Or use the arrogance as a steam that power my dreams
And my ego

[Verse 2: Beyoncé]
It's on baby, let's get lost
You don't need to call into work cause you're the boss
For real, want you to show me how you feel
I consider myself lucky, that's a big deal
Why? Well, you got the key to my heart
But you ain't gonna need it, I'd rather you open up my body
And show me secrets, you didn't know was inside
No need for me to lie

[Hook: Beyoncé]
It's too big, it's too wide
It's too strong, it won't fit
It's too much, it's too tough
He talk like this cause he can back it up
He got a big ego, such a huge ego
I love his big ego, it's too much
He walk like this cause he can back it up

[Verse 3: Beyoncé]
Usually I'm humble, right now I don't choose
You can leave with me or you could have the blues
Some call it arrogant, I call it confident
You decide when you find on what I'm working with
Damn I know I'm killing you with them legs
Better yet them thighs
Matter a fact it's my smile or maybe my eyes
Boy you a sight to see, kind of something like me

[Hook]
It's too big, it's too wide
It's too strong, it won't fit
It's too much, it's too tough
He talk like this cause he can back it up
He got a big ego, such a huge ego
I love his big ego, it's too much
He walk like this cause he can back it up

[Bridge: Beyoncé]
I, I walk like this cause I can back it up
I, I talk like this cause I can back it up
I, I can back it up, I can back it up
I walk like this cause I can back it up

[Hook]
It's too big, it's too wide
It's too strong, it won't fit
It's too much, it's too tough
He talk like this cause he can back it up
He got a big ego, such a huge ego
I love his big ego, it's too much
He walk like this cause he can back it up

[Verse 4: Beyoncé]
Ego so big, you must admit
I got every reason to feel like I'm that bitch
Ego so strong, if you ain't know
I don't need no beat, I can sing it with piano...
Woah...
Woah, Woah, Woah, Woah
Woah-oh-oh-oh
Woah-Woah-Woah
Woah-Woah-Woah
Woah-Woah, Woah-Woah, Woo...

(Oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh, oh-oh-oh)
