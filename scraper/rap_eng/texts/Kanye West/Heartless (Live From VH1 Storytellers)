Heartless
How could you be so?

[Hook]
In the night I hear them talk
The coldest story ever told
Somewhere far along this road
He lost his soul
To a woman so heartless
Heartless [x2]

[Verse 1]
How could you be so
Cold as the winter wind when it breeze yo
Just remember that you talking to me though
You need to watch the way you talking to me yo
I mean, after all the things that we been through
I mean, after all the things we got into
Ayyo, I know of some things that you ain't told me
Ayyo, I did some things but that's the old me
And now you wanna give me back and you gonna show me
So you walk round like you don't know me
You got a new friend
Well I got homies
But in the end it's still so lonely

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
How could you be so Dr. Evil?
You bringing out a side of me that I don't know
I decided we weren't gonna speak, so
Why we up 3 AM on the phone?
Why do she be so mad at me for?
Homie, I don't know she's hot and cold
I won't stop, won't mess my groove up
Cause I already know how this thing go
You run and tell your friends that you're leaving me
They say that they don't see what you see in me
You wait a couple of months, then you gon’ see
You'll never find nobody, never find nobody better than me

[Hook]

[Bridge]
Talk, and talk, and talk, and talk
Baby let's just knock it off
They don't know what we been through
They don't know about me and you
So I got something new to see
And you just gon’ keep hating me
And we just gon’ be enemies
I know you can't believe
I could just leave it wrong
And you can't make it right
I'm gon’ take off tonight into the night

[Hook]

How could you be so heartless? [4x]
How could you be so? [x2]

In the night I hear them talk
The coldest story ever told
Somewhere far along this road
He lost his soul
To a woman so, a woman so…

There is no Gucci I can buy
There is no Louis Vuitton to put on
There is no Y.S.L. that they could sell
To take my mind out of this hell
Or my heart out of this jail
There are no clothes that I could buy
That could turn, back in time
There is no vacation spot I could fly
That could turn back, a piece of real life
Real life, I ask you tonight
What does it feel like?
What does it feel like, I ask you tonight
What does it feel like?
To live a real life
I just wanna be a real boy
Pinocchio's story goes, to be a real boy
People say, you keep it too real boy
Pinocchio's story goes, to be a real boy

With a woman so heartless
So heartless
Is it my fault that I make you heartless?
Maybe I made you heartless, but regardless
That don’t give you the reason to act retarded
Yeah we fall, but you started
You started

No, no, no, nobody knows
Nobody knows

Did it have to go that far?
Did we have to take it that far?
You say things some time that you just can’t take back
Take back, take back
You’re gonna hit me one day, so take that, so take that
And that’s something you just can’t take back
Take back, take back
Never do nothing you can’t take back, take back

Does this hurtful comment have a receipt?
Does this staggering piece of truth
That was never told, have an expiration date?
Or can I take that back?
Take that back

And I guess it’s in the nighttime, I hear ‘em talk, talk
The coldest story ever told, the coldest story ever told
The coldest story ever told, the coldest story ever told
Ever told, never told
When I say the coldest story I mean the voices in my head
When I lay down in my bed, the voices in my head
When another woman is beside me in my bed

In the night I here ‘em talk
Coldest story ever told
Somewhere far along this road
He lost his soul
To a woman so heartless
How could you be so heartless?
Did I make you be heartless?
Did I make you be heartless?

50, look at me now
Singing on the ground
With my pink shirt on
Does this look gay to you?
Well, I don’t know what else to say to you
Look at me now
I’m on the ground
And my heart can still not be found
‘Cause I’ve looked all around
And my heart will never be found
I looked all around
And my heart’s nowhere to be found
Where is my heart right now?

With a woman so heartless
How could you be so?
How could you be so heartless?
How could you be so?

In the night I here ‘em talk
Coldest story ever told
Somewhere far along this road
I lost my soul
To somebody so heartless
How could you be so heartless?
How could you be so heartless?
