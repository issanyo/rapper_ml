[Verse 1]
It's amazing, I'm the reason
Everybody fired up this evening
I'm exhausted, barely breathing
Holding on to what I believe in

[Hook]
No matter what, you'll never take that from me
My reign is as far as your eyes can see
It's amazing, so amazing, so amazing, so amazing (x2)
It's amazing

[Verse 2]
I'm a monster, I'm a killer
I know I'm wrong
I'm a problem
That'll never ever be solved

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
I'm a monster, I'm a maven
I know this world is changing
Never gave up, never gave in
I'm the only thing I'm afraid of

[Hook]

So amazing, so amazing, so amazing

No matter what, you’ll never take that from me
My reign is as far…
Bring it back down though

It's amazing, I'm the reason
Everybody fired up this evening
I'm exhausted, barely breathing
Holding on to what I believe in
No matter what, you'll never take that from me
Never take that from me

No take it back down, take it back, keep going

It feels like you're on trial sometimes
And in a relationship, you can also be on trial
And be convicted with no jury

And this song was sort of like that moment where someone tells you ain't, you ain’t - you gotta say I am - an emancipation, if you will
Cause you can't take that from me
My self-esteem

So whether it something in your own home, or a situation like mine
Where you're under the microscope of the media

Never let them take that from you
I never let them, let them take that from me

You have to be amazing sometimes
I and I know I do not always state popular opinion

Amazing, Michael Jackson, amazing
Michael Phelps, amazing
OJ Simpson, amazing
Is he not?!
What he did when he did what he did, was he not amazing though?

I think I saw in a movie - I get my quotes from movies cause I don't read
Or from like, go figure, real life or something
Like live real live, talk to real people, get information, ask people, questions
And it was something about, you either die a superhero or you live to become the villain
I'M CHILLIN'

*Kanye chicken noise*

I'm chillin'

So many times they try to make me out to be the villain
I don't understand what I did
I apologize for acting like a bitch at award-shows
It's an award-show, didn't kill anyone
But yet and still I apologize for my ungraciousness

I was a spoiled little Chicago-boy, who got all these awards as he came in the door and people clapped and sang his praises
And he soaked it all up and believed his own hype
To the point where he could not lose
And if anyone didn't pick him, they could not choose
As he swooves with the who's-who's and broke all the rules
And even lost his cool
Hey, nothing new
Now they don't like you, hey they don't like you
Look at what you've done boy, trying to be the number one boy

And I'm thirty-one years now and I've leaned from my mistakes

Just play pianos...

Super-hero music, pain

This hardcore, so hardcore
That's why I sing:

I'm a monster, I'm maven
I know this world is changing
Never gave up, never gave in
I'm the only thing I'm afraid of
No matter what, you'll never take that from me
My reign is as far as your eyes can see
It's amazing
