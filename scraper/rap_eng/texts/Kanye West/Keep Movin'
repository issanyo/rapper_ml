I move rhymes like retail
Make sure the shit sell
I move rhymes like retail
Make sure the shit sell

The cycle starts: freestylin and ciphers at a party
Hardly no 'round town but still move bodies
The hotties only cut skills
Ungodly thoughts of "get it on" constantly bombard me
But I take everything in stride with time
Nowadays niggas ain't careful with their rhymes
Hey yo the glory that they all can't find
I sit and visualize how the shit would be mines
I got a plan with blueprints to sprint from one level to next from the rhymes I flex
So, who's ready to get whipped with text?
Grav fuckin your brain is the best of sex
If I had a condom, I still harmed 'em
Every time I thrust yo the condom would bust
I'm on a mission and I can't be stopped
First stage of a nigga tryna reach the top
Keep movin

I move rhymes like retail
Make sure the shit sell
(Keep movin)
I move rhymes like retail
Make sure the shit sell
(Keep movin, keep movin, keep movin)
I move rhymes like retail
Make sure the shit sell
(Keep movin)
I move rhymes like retail
Make sure the shit sell
(Keep movin, keep movin, keep movin)

Stage two of figuring out what to do to make things, these dreams manifest come true
Yo not to brag, but my rhymes is the fattest but it seems 'round town I got a whole new status
See now my name's gettin known and shit
Up in clubs always rockin microphones and shit
(Ay yo Grav, there's mad new faces around!)
Yo dips givin me hugs, niggas givin me pounds
But I gotta decipher who's real and who ain't
While a lotta niggas real more niggas is fake
Yo they got way too much time to kill
While I'm out bustin ass tryna pay my bills
Nine to five tried to rip a brother apart
But the rap game stayed deep down in my heart
Monduks always said (finish what you start)
It ain't a damn thing that can take me off my mark
Keep movin

I move rhymes like retail
Make sure the shit sell
(Keep movin)
I move rhymes like retail
Make sure the shit sell
(Keep movin, keep movin, keep movin)
I move rhymes like retail
Make sure the shit sell
(Keep movin)
I move rhymes like retail
Make sure the shit sell
(Keep movin, keep movin, keep movin)

So in these hard times I hope and pray my heart finds the right path to take, the right moves to make
Avoid fakes so my soul ain't scarred cause the soul warned me of potholes in my lawn (word bond)
So I took heed to the warnin, that's why God blessed me with life every mornin
Yo plus I kinda find it strange how cause I make moves niggas think shit changed
(Ay yo Grav the same) Just closer to his visions, stayin on my toes, makin the decisions
To make all my talents manifest to achieve one goal: life with less stress
Knife damage on my back's made of metal, for the niggas that's gas my foot is on the pedal
To accelerate past your mental state for a head-on collision with fame with no brakes
