[Chorus]
I'mma testify, come up in the spot looking extra fly
Till the day you die, we gonna touch the sky
We gonna touch the sky
Let me testify, come up in the spot looking extra fly
Till the day I die I'm gonna touch the sky

[Verse 1]
Now let me take you back to 2003
I just graduated tryna figure now where I should be
Now let's be honest, your collage really wasn't for me
And there wasn't no entry schools that gave out collage degrees
Now hold up, hold up
Contrary to what they believe
I found Full Sail on back of the magazine
And that was after my guidance counselor threw his hands up
For that I say fuck you, let me pull my pants up
Mama looking at me cry bout to leave a baby
Let me in Florida like 'Boy don't worry you gonna make it!'
And at least you made it this far, long way from Dayton
Told me hit the crowd and don't trip over your
Days that I didn't eat, days that I didn't sleep
Class though that seven, I'm still five trynna make that beat
You falling the pressure if you let it and he make you weak
And what don't kill you make you stronger, shit as you can see

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
And now let's take it high
Now let's take it high

[Verse 2]
My lil' cousin died so I said fuck school
I went back home like what the fuck I'm gonna do
Stressing but in every tragedy comes a blessing
Not in anger I done turn my passion into an obsession
Wasn't drinking, wasn't smoking, wasn't killing, wasn't fucking
Nigga I won't do nothing going crazy, I'm like fuck it
I don't know the last time somebody saw me out in public
Mama said 'Don't give up, just believe your time it's coming!'
Girls keep coming and go, I'm impossible to deal with
Telling me they hurt, they bout to leave and I don't feel shit
Lost so many girl that really love me on some real shit
Niggas came through some nights like you ain't gotta deal shit
Fighting a frustration, back and forth from Flint to Florida
Was [???] every week was at a bus station
I guess it paid off, what more can I say?
Cause all that hard work got me sitting next to Dre

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Justin Daye]
I'm the five foot seven
The way I'm rhyming remind em of 9/11
If the sky's the limit I ain't fucking with you niggas
I'm still plotting the scheming to get to heaven
I'm still dreaming of being on David Letterman
Crossing over to popular culture, like I'm supposed to
The living I envision in my head is what's pulling a part of me closer
I'm hardly a bolster, it's no homicides in Burbank
You dwelling on negativity when my niggas ain't
My niggas ain't got time to waste, I'm placed with kings
The crown sitting on the side of my face
This is for niggas who die for it while I'm alive for it
The opportunity though is mind blowing
This girl from school told me I wasn't gon' win
I really wonder how a 9 to 5 going

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
