[Verse 1]
Three lines in the peace sign
Me you God perfectly combined
Birds singing in the wind still flying free
Melodies made talk to me softly
While the sun fades the clouds haze
Warming colors
Come together from the sun rays
And when I sit and think
The sky turns pink
And your face becomes alive

[Bridge 1]
The wind in my hair
I roll back my eyes
The echo inside
Said you have a place right here
The Miss rages on
The water calls out
She said it aloud
Baby you're smooth like cashmere

[Verse 2]
Four types in the word love
Let our vain efforts unshackle us
Listen to the rich sound
Of the thumping heart
Mixed in with the thoughts of going far
The ending day the moon raised
Glowing brightly
Like a spotlight on the dark waves
Singing to the lay he begins to play
And the song becomes alive

[Bridge 2]
The voice in your soul
It roars in the night
Me hearing the right
It resonates through my ears
The Miss rages on
The waters call out
She said it aloud
Baby you're smooth like cashmere

[Hook]
Baby you're smooth like cashmere
I don't want nobody else here
No I don't want nobody else here
Because you're smooth like cashmere

[Break]
Flowing like falling water
Easy as the breeze
(Come on just hear me)
Soft like the scent of honey
Sailing so serene
(Babe believe me)
Still like a bird in mid flight
Calming is the view
(I enjoyed this day with you)

[Verse 3]
Five times to the good will
Vibes floating  everywhere with the Small chill
Sitting back
Watching God make the next day tells me
Everything will be okay
You take my hand I catch a glance
Of someone who knows that we both have a chance
Staring at the sky with our eyes wide
We watched the heavens come alive

[Bridge 3]
He told us hello
And then said good bye
He made us realized
That our minds are very clear
The Miss rages on
The waters call out
She said it aloud
Baby he's smooth like cashmere
