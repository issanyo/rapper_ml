Will.i.am:
We start that stuff that then become cool
We start them trends that then become rulez
Leavin' stickers on hat that your kids wear to school

Kenny:
Kenny West, teeth Crest
Came up from the gutter
Never fooled by Fabio, I can't believe its not butter

Bruno:
Low in cholesterol, yeah

Kenny:
Don't hear what we're sayin'? Just ask some white teens
Where you think they got the shutter shades and tight jeans?

Will.i.am:
And we're up in this club with more secrets than Free Masons
Never have to pay for beats because we always free basin'
Movin' in silence that's how the crew goes
Runnin' this like a snotty nose

Nicki:
Gonna need a tissue

Will.i.am:
Disappear like the career of Kevin Costner
While we're sittin' here drinkin' beer with Jimmy Hoffa

Kenny:
That's my eyeball looking at you from the pyramid on cash
We're so bad we can make an iPad run Flash
Got more secrets than deodorant
Bitch, we don't perspire
We're uncredited consultants on HBO's "The Wire"

Bruno:
Mmmnnn, once again
I love the Bubbles, de-de-de

Will.i.am:
Yeah, we start that stuff that then become cool
We start them trends that then become rulez
We're the first one to wait thirty minutes before swimming in the pool

All:
Illuminati starts shit that then becomes cool
Illuminati starts the trends that then becomes rulez
Illuminati!
