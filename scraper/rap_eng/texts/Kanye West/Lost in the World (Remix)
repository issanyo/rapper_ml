[Intro]
People looked at me differently and they knew I was with somebody. I didn't have to wait in the line at bakery on Sunday mornings anymore for fresh bread. The owner knew who I was with and he'd come from around the counter. No matter how many people were waiting, I was taken care of first. Our neighbors didn't park in our driveway anymore, even though we didn't have a car. I mean at 13, I was making more money than most of the grownups in the neighborhood.  I mean I had more money than I could spend. I had it all!

[Chorus]
I'm up in the woods
I'm down on my mind
I'm building a still
To slow down time
I'm lost in the world
I'm down on my line
I'm new in the city
And I'm down for the night
Down for the night
Said shes down for the night
I'm lost in the world
I'm down on my line
I'm new in the city
And I'm down for the night
Down for the night
Said shes down for the night

[Verse]
Look at my situation, I couldn’t ask for more
I’m the real Situation, I should be on Jersey Shore
Look what that kilo sent me, that Porsche is key less entry
That girl is high and drunk, I swear the rest is elementary
We found a superfreak, no, she won’t know what hit her
I’m on my Rick James, minus the beads and glitter
You’ve got to beg my pardon, this shit here is money talking
You don’t get good dick too often, I’mma have you funny walking
See that shit I pull up parking, make your neck snap the fuck off and
Damn, too late you lost it, back to that world you lost in
Back to that world you lost in

[Bridge]
I'm up in the woods, I'm down on my mind
(Run from the lights, run from the night)
I'm new in the city, but I'm down for the night
(Run for your life, down for the night)
I'm lost in the world, been down my whole life
I'm new in the city, and I'm down for the night
Down for the night
Down for the night

Who will survive in America?
Who will survive in America?
Who will survive in America?
Who will survive in America?

[Outro]
I'm lost in the world, been down my whole life
I'm new in the city, and I'm down for the night
Down for the night
Down for the night
I'm lost in the world, been down my whole life
I'm new in the city, and I'm down for the night
Down for the night
Down for the night
