[Chorus]
Breathe out, breathe in
American oxygen, woah
Every breath I breathe
Chasin' this American Dream
We sweat for a nickel and a dime
Turn it into an empire, woah
Breathe in this feeling
American, American oxygen

[Refrain]
American oxygen
Breathe in this feeling
American, American oxygen

[Verse 1]
Oh say, can you see - this is the American Dream
Young girl, hustlin' on the other side of the ocean
You can be anything at all in America, America
I say if you can't see
Just close your eyes and breathe

[Chorus]
Breathe out, breathe in
American oxygen, woah
Every breath I breathe
Chasin' this American Dream
We sweat for a nickel and a dime
Turn it into an empire, woah
Breathe in this feeling
American, American oxygen

[Refrain]
American oxygen
Breathe in, this feeling
American, American oxygen
American oxygen
Breathe in, this feeling
American, American oxygen

[Verse 2]
Oh say, can you see - this is the American Dream
Young boy, hustlin', tryna get the wheels in motion
But he can be anything at all in America, America
I say if you can't see
Just close your eyes and breathe

[Chorus]
Breathe out, breathe in
American oxygen, woah
Every breath I breathe
Chasin' this American Dream
We sweat for a nickel and a dime
Turn it into an empire, woah
Breathe in this feeling
American, American oxygen

[Bridge]
This is the new America
We are the new America
This is the new America
We are the new America

[Chorus]
Breathe out, breathe in
American oxygen, woah
Every breath I breathe
Chasin' this American Dream
We sweat for a nickel and a dime
Turn it into an empire, woah
Breathe in this feeling
American, American oxygen

[Refrain]
American oxygen
Breathe in, this feeling
American, American oxygen
American oxygen
Breathe in, this feeling
American, American oxygen

[Outro]
This is the new America
We are the new America
This is the new America
We are the new America
