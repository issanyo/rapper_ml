[Verse 1]
My friends say I'm a fool to think that you're the one for me
I guess I'm just a sucker for love
Cause honestly the truth is that you know I'm never leaving
Cause you're my angel sent from above

[Pre-Chorus]
Baby you can do no wrong, my money is yours
Give you little more because I love ya, love ya
With me, girl, is where you belong, just stay right here
I promise my dear I'll put nothing above ya, above ya

[Chorus]
Love me, love me, say that you love me
Fool me, fool me, oh how you do me
Kiss me, kiss me, say that ya miss me
Tell me what I want to hear, tell me you love me
Love me, love me, say that ya love me
Fool me, fool me, oh how ya do me
Kiss me, kiss me, say that ya miss me
Tell me what I want to hear, tell me you love me

[Verse 2]
People try to tell me but I still refuse to listen
Cause they don't get to spend time with you
A minute with you is worth more than
A thousand days without your love, oh your love

[Pre-Chorus]
Baby you can do no wrong, my money is yours
Give you little more because I love ya, love ya
With me, girl, is where you belong, just stay right here
I promise my dear I'll put nothing above ya, above ya

[Chorus]
Love me, love me, say that you love me
Fool me, fool me, oh how ya do me
Kiss me, kiss me, say that ya miss me
Tell me what I want to hear, tell me you love me
Love me, love me, say that ya love me
Fool me, fool me, oh how ya do me
Kiss me, kiss me, say that ya miss me
Tell me what I want to hear, tell me you love me

[Bridge]
My heart is blind but I don't care
Cause when I'm with you everything has disappeared
And every time I hold ya near
I never want to let ya go, oh

[Chorus]
Love me, love me, say that you love me
Fool me, fool me, oh how ya do me
Kiss me, kiss me, say that ya miss me
Tell me what I want to hear, tell me you love me
Love me, love me, say that ya love me
Fool me, fool me, oh how ya do me
Kiss me, kiss me, say that ya miss me
Tell me what I want to hear, tell me you love me
