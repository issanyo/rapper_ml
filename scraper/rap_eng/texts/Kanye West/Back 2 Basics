[Intro]
W-W-W- Well Done
Let’s try some different shit

[Verse 1]
Ahhh
I’m so flashy, you so ratchet
Twelve jewels fashion with a pedal to Matchin'
New Maybach, that’s a hit nigga
Could’ve been the 3rd member, the clipse nigga
Listen niggas, I go grizzly that’s Memphis nigga
Ross rap that 24, ain’t gotta convince niggas
Early pimpin, throw like Blake Griffin
Lips zip it
Niggas gossip like it’s tradition
These bitches can’t drive my car
The melt engine, hell’s risen
Ride Diablo to a baptism, he Christian
Fear nothing but God, kill all except women and children
I don’t testify not in my interest
Persistence, diligence, the skill I bring can feed the hunger mission
Got the whole world, fill em on my brand but they won’t mention it
You afraid of my accomplishments
You a bitch, straight up got a taser for my bitch with a laser
And she just wishin' for a genie in the bottle
This is not a novel, we no feel for sorrow and it shine tomorrow
Super dollars like a super lotto, shootin' at yo collar
Now you sippin' soup to swallow
Go throwin' in the towel
Our time is now but we devour everything we offer
Then pop it up but drink and blow a sake
Mr. kick shit Myiagi
Wax on, wax off
Ferrari, she gon' lick the lolly
I am not the baby boy terazi, slick lody
Laughin at yo clown pose, you bust into you
I got arsenal, time to give to be impossible
Options to embarrass you, I just choose what God would do
Can’t waste my time on you
Fuckers can’t rhyme no more
Bout crime no more
Made so much money at home, didn’t even tour
My fans waitin', savin' up for greatness, I appreciate it
Let’s get back to basics
