Disick: Hey, do you like Kanye West?

Cheban: Yeah, he's okay, I guess

D: Well, the early work was a little too hip-hop for me in my taste, but when Dark Twisted Fantasy came out in 2010, I think he really came into his own, both musically and lyrically

D: Kanye's been compared to Jesus, Hitler, Walt Disney, and even Steve Jobs

C: Hey Disick

D: Yes Jonathan?

C: Why do you have copies of Billboard magazine all over the place? Do you have a little dog - a little chow or something? *laughs*

D: No, Jonathan!

C: Is that a raincoat?

D: Yes, it is! Now, Kanye's decided to release this, Yeezus, his most exciting record so far. It should be obvious by now that "New Slaves" is the undisputed masterpiece of Yeezus. A song so catchy, most people won't even remember the lyrics! But they should. And then there's the song "I Am a God". The title practically speaks for itself, but of course the insecurities of the mainstream music press will never understand its true meaning because it's about me! Hey Jonathan!

D: Try getting the Yeezus album now motherfucker!
