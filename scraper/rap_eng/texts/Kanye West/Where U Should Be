[Intro]
That girl looking good over there man. What should I do?

[Kanye]
It's your big brother Kanye To The. And I know how you feel about shawty. Man, I was going through the same thing when I was your age

[Young Leek]
I got you

[Hook: Ne-Yo]
I'm just saying
This is where you should be
Girl let him know that he alright but
You wanna rock with me
Let it go
Come and let me
Give you what you need
Come and let me
Give you what you need
Girl don't play
Send him on his way
Come ride with me

[Verse Two: Kanye West]
And the party was just so tense is
But all this waiting around is just so senseless
And I've been calling her phone so relentless
Mama said the phone bill was so expensive
Your eyes slanted like Lucy Liu
You're frank couture to the juicy suit
Your lips sweater than a Juicy Fruit
From your Louie Vuitton bag to your Gucci boots
Whether we on a train or a two seat Coupe
I'mma fiend for you like Pookie do
I was there with [?] Whoopty Woo
She was there with her man, some goofy dude
And I ain't really trying to be rude to dude
All I need is a change to advance, take my hand
Understand from a dance I could end up your man
If I'd been scared wouldn't have seen her again
Oh

[Hook]
