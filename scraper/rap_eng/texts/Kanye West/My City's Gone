[Verse 1]
They boarded up my favorite bar
The Frenchman lost his restaurant
And the secret alleys were rearranged
I woke one day and it had changed

[Chorus]
My city's gone
My city's gone
Feeling lost in inevitable

[Verse 2]
On forty-three, my heart once beat
On forty-five, I came alive
And there was a spirit, so young and free
It spoke to you, it spoke to me

[Chorus (Kanye West)]
My city's gone (my city, oh oh)
Oh no, my city's gone (my city's gone)
Feeling lost in inevitable

[Verse 3]
I met a man who coughed and swore
That it had been changing since it was born
That it was I and nothing more
From twenty-three to thirty-four

[Chorus]
My city's gone
My city's gone
And I have to go
My city's gone

[Outro]
I still found me back in the mall
I will not decline
Still feeling lost and nothing more
I feel lost in time
Does anybody happen to know (happen to know)
Way after I'm
Still feeling lost and manageable
I say nothing's right
Tell it all from the heart
I'm sitting out at the bar
Tell it all that I'm making my way
