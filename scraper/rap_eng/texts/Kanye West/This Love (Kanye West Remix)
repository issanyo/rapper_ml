[Interlude: Adam Levine & John Legend]
Ohh, woah, woahh
Ohh, woah, woahh

[Verse 1: Adam Levine]
I was so high I did not recognize
The fire burning in her eyes
The chaos that controlled my mind
Whispered goodbye as she got on a plane
Never to return again
But always in my heart

[Hook: Adam Levine (W/ John Legend Vocals)]
Oh, this love has taken its toll on me
She said goodbye too many times before
And her heart is breaking in front of me
I have no choice
'Cause I won't say goodbye anymore

[Interlude: Adam Levine & John Legend]
Ohh, woah, woah

[Verse 2: Adam Levine]
I tried my best to feed her appetite
Keep her coming every night
So hard to keep her satisfied
Oh, kept playing love like it was just a game
Pretending to feel the same
Then turn around and leave again, but

[Hook: Adam Levine (W/ John Legend Vocals)]
Oh, this love has taken its toll on me
She said goodbye too many times before
And her heart is breaking in front of me
I have no choice
'Cause I won't say goodbye anymore

[Interlude: Adam Levine & John Legend]
Ohh, woah, woah

[Bridge: Adam Levine]
I'll fix these broken things
Repair your broken wings
And make sure everything's alright
Oh, my pressure on your hips
Sinking my fingertips
Every inch of you
'Cause I know that's what you want me to do

[Hook: Adam Levine (W/ John Legend Vocals)]
Oh, this love has taken its toll on me
She said goodbye too many times before
And her heart is breaking in front of me
I have no choice
'Cause I won't say goodbye anymore

[Outro: Adam Levine]
This love has taken its toll on me
She said goodbye too many times before
And my heart is breaking in front of me
She said goodbye too many times before
Oh yeah, yeah...
And she will be loved...
