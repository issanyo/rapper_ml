“I’m not gonna mention him no more, I’m past that,” Yeezus said of the president on Philadelphia station Hot 107.9. “That’s out my thoughts. That’s lowering my priority of thinking at this point.”

“Oh, you talking about how he use to come and visit me and my mama and tell me he’s about to run for president?” Ye' replied when asked if he would ever "break bread" with the president and continued, “I just think that we’re pop icons, and the president likes to use that type of thing just to be down. People was fine with me being everyone’s punching bag for about five years — ‘This is the person we love to hate, so if you want to distract people from everything that’s going on … just say you hate Kanye and there’s going be 30 other people who say they hate Kanye.’ That was kind of my position in culture and he kind of used that too — ‘Oh, he’s a jackass’ — because that’s how the world felt."

“I don’t care if someone’s the president or not,” Kanye finished. “I care about thoughts and how you helping people and what you bring to the world.”
