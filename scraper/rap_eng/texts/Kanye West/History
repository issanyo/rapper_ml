[Hook]
Now that all the smoke is gone (lighter)
And the battle's finally won (give me a lighter)
Victory’s finally ours (Lighters up, lighters up)
History so loved, so long, so long, so long…

[Verse 1: Jay-Z]
In search of victory, she keeps eluding me
If only we could be together momentarily
We could make love, and make history
Why won’t you visit me, until she visits me
I’ll be stuck with her sister, her name is defeat
She gives me agony, so much agony
She brings me so much pain, so much misery
Like missing your last shot and falling to your knees
As the crowd screams, for the other team
I've practiced so hard for this moment victory don’t leave
I know what this means, I’m stuck in this routine
Whole new different day, but the same old things
All I got is dreams, but nobody else could see
Nobody else believes, nobody else but me
Where are you victory? I need you desperately
Not just for the moment, to make history

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Jay-Z]
So now I’m flirting with death
Hustling like a G, while victory wasn’t watching
Took chances repeatedly
As a teenage boy, before acne
Before I got proactive, I couldn’t face she
I just threw on my hoodie and headed to the streets
I swear I met success, we lived together shortly
A success is like lust, she's good for the touch
She's good for the moment, but she’s never enough
Everybody’s had her, she’s nothing like V
A success is all I got, unfortunately
But I’m burning down the block, hopin' in and out of V's
But something tells me that there’s much more to see
Before I get killed, cause I can’t get robbed
So before me, success and death ménage
I gotta get lost, I gotta find V
We gotta be together to make history

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Jay-Z]
Now victory is mine, she tastes so sweet
She’s my trophy wife, she's coming with me
We'll have a baby who stutters repeatedly
We'll name him history, he'll repeat after me
He’s my legacy, son of my hard work
Future of my past, he’ll explain who I be
Rank me amongst the greats, either 1, 2 or 3
If I ain’t number one then I failed you victory
Ain’t in it for the fame, that dies within weeks
Ain’t in it for the money, can’t take it when you leave
I wanna be remembered long after you grieve
Long after I’m gone, long after I breathe
I leave all I am, in the hands of history
That's my last will testimony
This is much more than a song, it’s a baby shower
I’ve been waiting for this hour, history, you're ours
