[Intro]
A'udhu Billahi min ash-shaytaan-i'r rajeem. Bismillah-i'r Rahman-i'r Raheem

Allahu Akbar, Allahu Akbar
Allahu Akbar, Allahu Akbar

This is one's for all my brothers and sisters who died in Iraq, Israel, Afghanistan and right here in America
(Jesus Walks)

Abraham Taught
Muhammad Taught
And Moses split the sea
(Jesus Walk with me)
I ain't tryin' to profit off the prophets so this one's for free

[Verse 1]
G's up along with Muhammad and Jesus
In the Quran they call him Isa
Don't think Osama and Saddam is our leader
We pray for peace, but the drama intrigues us
All, so we fall for the illusions of the beast
So instead of tryin' to teach we show our teeth
Same God, different beliefs
Hijabs, Sunday clothes, yarmulke, kufi, same mission beneath
We all tryin' to get to where the sufferin' ends
In front of the Most High bein' judged for our sins
Can't front for the Most High, so the struggle
Continues
You, every bee, bird and tree, he, her and me
We virtually on the same boat
With the same goats, on the same sea
Tryin' to stay afloat, and put the devil in the yoke
With a couple of God's quotes

[Hook]
Ash-had an la ilaha illa llah
(Astaghfirullah)

[Verse 2]
And to the sisters and the mothers of ours
Who cover theyselves cause they're lovers of God
The Creator of the worlds, Sculptor of the stars
During Hajj, we walk, through Ramadaan, we starve
Though you not eatin', there's a feedin' of the mind
A defeatin' of the demons, a seein' of the signs
A leanin' on the lines from the surahs
Getting purer, God deemed it unclean
(There's no eatin' of the swine)
Nor drinkin' of the wine
We all bend to his whims, so I send out a message to my kind
I’m cordial to Mr. Norful, Mrs. Adams you’re the theme song when I’m battling
Creflo, player, what’s happening? I can hear the truth in your rappings
(No)
Sex before you marry
No grudges
You should carry, no lyin'
Not supposed to be gamblin'

[Hook]
(I know it sounds familiar)
We all the same man
It's all a game
The devil hate each and every one of us exactly the same
(I wanna walk like Jesus, talk like Jesus sall Allāhu ʿalay-hi wa-sallam)

[Verse 3]
You know
(uh)
And to my Akh's tryin to stay on their deen
It gets mean especially when you stay on the scene
And at the same try to stay out of trouble
But don't forget the blessin' is in the struggle
The Most Forgiving will forgive it if you stay repentant
And hustle
You gotta stay on your salats, your zakats, your Quran
To my homies and miskeen
Astagfirullah
Allah forgive us all
For we all are sinners
Bless us to be among the winners
When it ends
But until then please strengthen the mission within our hearts
All praise is due to God
(Amen)
Tellin' it how it was taught me
I ain't tryin' to sell it can be brought for free
This is how it is
Now how it ought to be
Muhammad talk to me
Jesus walk with me
I hope

[Hook]
(I know it sounds familiar)
We all the same man
It's all a game
The devil hate each and every one of us exactly the same
(I wanna walk like Jesus, talk like Jesus sall Allāhu ʿalay-hi wa-sallam)
