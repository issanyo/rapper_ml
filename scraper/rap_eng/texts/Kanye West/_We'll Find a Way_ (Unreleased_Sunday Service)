[Verse 1]
There's been a lot of change in my life
Some might've guessed and some dared to find
Must keep the faith in, faith in each other
You are my brother, family

[Chorus]
Bodies on the wall around us (yeah-yeah)
Watching people all around us (yeah)
Gotta wake up to the call above us (Ooh-ooh-oh)
Then I know it's gonna be alright (Yeah-yeah)
It's gonna come around, we're enlightened
Praying that we all stay guided
Some way, somehow (Ooh-ohh)
We'll find a way

[Verse 2]
We will weld this world, world back together
Let's make a way, We'll lead the way (Must)
Must keep the faith, faith in each other
You are my brother, family

[Chorus]
Bodies on the wall around us (Trap)
Watching people all around us
Gotta wake up to the call above us
Then I know it's gonna be alright
It's gonna come back around, we're enlightened
Praying that we all stay guided
Some way, somehow (Ooh-ohh)
We'll find a way
Hey (Ooh-ooh-ooh)
We'll find a way
Some way, somehow (Ooh-ohh)
We'll find a way, we'll find a way

[Verse 3]
There's been a lot of change in our lives (Change)
Some would've guessed and some dared to find (Ooh-ohh)
Must keep the faith in, faith in each other (Ooh)
You are my brother, family

[Chorus]
Bodies on the wall around us (Yeah)
Watching people all around us (Yeah)

Praying that we all stay guided
Some way, somehow (Ooh-ooh)
