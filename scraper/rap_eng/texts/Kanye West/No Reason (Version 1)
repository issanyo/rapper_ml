[Chorus: Kanye West]
A hunnid years from now we gon' all be dead, all be dead
All be dead, so tonight, bitch, I might as well get head

[Bridge: Post Malone]
I got a tan line, I wear my fuckin' Rollie so much
Lil' bitch, you think you somethin' but I find you in the gutter
Kinda want it, bought it with the money, oh look
Which girl you don't fuck, I'm gonna tell you how to fuck her

[Refrain: Post Malone]
Count a hunnid bands, watch it swerve on the street (oh-yeah)
Count a hunnid bands, will I know? No, not me (oh-oh-oh)

[Verse 1: Post Malone]
An' I got a hunnid-thousand in my motherfuckin' bag
Pull up Saint Laurent and I put it on the jet (oh-oh-oh)
Motherfuckin' jet, drop the top on a Bent'
Pull up to the fuckin' club and I'm smackin' on your bitch (oh-oh-oh)
Lil' mama gon' suck me up, hell no, 'cause we're on your season (oh-oh-oh)
Now I got shawty on my...
Yeah, I left her for no reason
Leon DeChino gon' fuck on your bitch
I just don't remember nothing when I wake
I just put forty-thousand on my wrist
I just be like I'm a man on a mission (oh-oh-oh)
Got a rattlesnake, keep it hissin' (rattle)
And I hold it now with no reason (ayy)

[Bridge: Post Malone]
I got a tan line, I wear my fuckin' Rollie so much
Lil' bitch, you think you somethin' but I find you in the gutter
Kinda want it, bought it with the money, oh look
Which girl you don't fuck, I'm gonna tell you how to fuck her

[Chorus: Kanye West]
A hunnid years from now we gon' all be dead, all be dead
All be dead, so tonight, bitch, I might as well get head
A hunnid years from now, we gon' all be dead, all be dead (Boom!)
So tonight, I might as well get head

[Verse 2: Justin Bieber]
And you talkin' that shit for no reason
When you know you comin' home this evenin'
Why you wanna come and play with my emotions?
When you know you should be going through the motions
We don't got no time to waste, whoa-oa-oa
This is not the time or place, oh-oh-ohhh
This the shit that make you wanna wow (wow, wow)
And I really think I'm on that king shit
Make you wanna bow down (bow down)
Ooh, I'm feelin' like I lost it now
Got me runnin' like a faucet now
Tell 'em there's a new boss in town
Girl, I'm feelin' like I'm lost and found
'Cause I'm so up and down

[Refrain: Post Malone]
Count a hunnid bands, watch it swerve on the street (oh-oh-oh)
Count a hunnid bands, will I know? No, not me

[Chorus: Kanye West]
A hunnid years from now we gon' all be dead, all be dead
All be dead, so tonight, bitch, I might as well get head
A hunnid years from now we gon' all be dead, all be dead
So tonight, I might as well get head
