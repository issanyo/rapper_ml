[Verse 1]
Baby it seems the time is never right
You're goin' left and I'm goin' right
Its crazy
But I'm still waiting

[Prehook]
If I play my cards right
My lucks gonna strike
Until then there's a night
All I wanna do

[Hook]
Is dream, dream, dream, dream
Dream, dream, dream, dream
Like lovers do
And it might come true

[Bridge]
If I dream, dream, dream, dream
Dream, dream, dream, dream
It just might be the only time that I'm with you
When I dream, dream, dream
Dream, dream
Oh, I dream
Yes, I dream
Dream, dream
Dream, dream
They say that dreams they sometimes do come true

[Verse 2]
Your star shines so bright
You're the queen of my night
In the daytime not quite
But I'm so glad that I

[Hook]
