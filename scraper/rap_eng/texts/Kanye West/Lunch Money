[Chorus]
Yeah, I'm taking niggas' lunch money
Too bad, I was fucking hungry
Real niggas don't notice you
I'm the only dope boy quotable

[Verse 1]
Mami tryna land a Sinatra
So she don't fuck niggas with Apple watches
Cause Rolex shopping is more exciting
Shout out to dope boy lit 16 swipers
Howard homecoming kingpins
Movie on my neck with the screen gems
Me and my nigga havin' bottle wars
40 thousand on the floor when them bottles pour (Spill, nigga)
A Blu Ray to your DVD
You might've caught me on TMZ
Cameo tryna sue a nigga (Fuck 'em)
Cause I party hard like it's three of me
America's still abusing us
And 9/11 is the Ku Klux
So why wouldn't I fire back
When every day them niggas shooting us?
True enough, I'm out of line
You better stand for something 'fore you out of time
This is crime by design
If the crown ain't mine, tell me who am I behind

[Chorus]
Yeah, I'm taking niggas' lunch money
Too bad, I was fucking hungry
Real niggas don't notice you
I'm the only dope boy quotable

[Verse 2]
Poppy get me everything I want
Riding 'round with Miguel Cotto in the trunk
What I'm cooking in the kitchen, niggas
Bobby Brown, New Edition, niggas
What I'm wearing in this blizzard, nigga
Mink, leather or it's lizard, nigga
Saint Laurent, I'm in all layers
The mannequin to you ballplayers
Shout out my Mac 11 monster
Grew up on Nintendo playing Contra
And though that nigga only 5'9"
100 bodies on his timeline
What's the price of success?
Lost my bitch, bought a chef
The 911 cost 211
Watch looking like a jeweler's heaven
Hottest 7, I'm so alive
Your bank account Swiss, nigga, so is mine
This is crime by design
If the crown ain't mine, tell me who am I behind

[Chorus]
Yeah, I'm taking niggas' lunch money
Too bad, I was fucking hungry
Real niggas don't notice you
I'm the only dope boy quotable
