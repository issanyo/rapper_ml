[Intro]
And it'll be a long time, before you ever see me again, me again

[Verse 1]
They want me, hold my head in shame
So I hold 'em on, holding hands in vein
Couple [?] of the feds say I'm insane
A psych said I'm going [?]
And then his son told me put down the drink dawg
I got a [?]
I guess [?] finna chop it's head off
I need a little something to knock the edge off
Aside from this song, life sucks
[?]
[?] modest
And every, god needs a goddess
And every, star couldn't guide us
It falls upon something that's inside us
So I [?] with my riders
[?] with my Riders
[?]

[Hook]
And I don't like them, and they don't like that
They don't like that, and I don't want that
And it'll be a long time before you ever see me again
Don't worry about me, worry 'bout you
Worry about something, don't worry what I do
Hating motherfuckers, it'll be a long time
Before you ever see me again, me again

[Verse 2]
See I need some time to meditate
Naw bitch I'm fly I need time to levitate
And I don't sound try, tryna' hesitate
[?] nigga, you a featherweight
And I'm a heavyweight and I'm very great
I put the everyday rocking in every state
Do not debate, you cannot cape
I must've on faith, getting knocked of faith
Guess it's not faith, guess it was written
I can sell a phone, guess I was different
That was cellphone back then, that was different
Now I'm spitting and everybody's just spitting
And what it sound like when everybody sound like
What you sound like, bumpin' 'em on a round mic
I don't even have a knife
Feel like [?]
And these niggas are secondary like Pippen around Mike
Trippin' around sight, something on that down light
I'mma be downright, you niggas is downright biters
And I'mma [?] fighters
And my shit downright fire, from the corner buyer
And I'm alone, eh

[Hook]
Don't worry 'bout me, don't worry 'bout them
Don't worry 'bout you, and what you gonna do
And it'll be a long time before you ever see me again
Don't worry 'bout me, don't worry 'bout me
Don't worry 'bout you and maybe I do
[?]
And it'll be a long time before you ever see me again
Don't worry 'bout me, don't worry 'bout you
I worry 'bout something not we can do
[?] me
And it'll be a long time before you ever see me again, me again
Don't worry 'bout me, na na na na
And it'll be a long time before you ever see me again, me again
Again, again
Before you ever see me again, me again, again, again
It'll be a long time before you ever see me again

[Bridge]
Can you clap your hands, hands
Clap your, clap your hand, hands
Clap your, clap your hand, hands
And I wanna something, I wanna something then
Can you clap your hand, hand
Need you to clap your hand, hand
Need you to clap your hand, hand
Need you to clap your hand
Need you to clap your hand, hand
Need you to clap your hand
Need you to clap your hand, hand
Need you to clap your hand

[Verse 3]
So the song like a Section 8
So I pass that dick around like the collection plate
I can sell 'em on Sunday with the [?]
I be stunting with the stunnas, and that's the best you make
So if everybody just stand now, and shit don't pan out
Throw your hands up, at least give them a handout
And with the sun shown, it's like the Jerome is
[?] on the cellphone days, I'm homeless
Or feeling like Ike at the end of the movie
Wait, just need two shows just to get to me
Or feeling like Eddie Kane, I still got it
And it's something but the problem is, you still not it
Or maybe if it's sicker, they say I'm "that nigga"
Or maybe if [?] is not a cellphone [?]
Or maybe damn, I could just blow my shit [?]
Maybe I should stop being real, maybe I should get on Twitter
Maybe I should [?] I could reconsider
[?] cellphone liver
And I'mma drink until I can't stand and got no liver
I can stand and deliver 'til the [?]
And I'mma spit it, like it get it, gonna die by the [?]
I'd rather live by what I live by, then die when I'm fine
I'm gonna stand by my self 'til my very last breath
Cause you know what? A coward dies a thousand deaths
And I'm proud [?]
And I could style on [?], hell with this
You can't style on me, nigga I'm [?]
I'm liable to be a liability [?]
You plan to style on me, trying to style on me
Nigga, I'm liable to be a liability, and my ability
I can sound like [?]
[?]

[Hook 2]
Don't worry 'bout me, worry 'bout you
Worry about something, something will do
And motherfuckers, it'll be a long time
Before you ever see me again
So don't worry about me, I'll be fine
I'll be up some, going for mine
And it'll be a long time
'fore you ever see me again, me again
Don't worry 'bout me, worry 'bout you, worry 'bout you
'fore you ever see

[Verse 4]
Don't worry about what I been up to
When the fuck I'm going hard, nigga fuck you
Who the fuck is going, I can [?]
Who the fucks asking? I'll put the summer on blast and
Who the fucks lasting?
And be the last standing
Caught up on the [?]
Get a better tan and
I been feeling dandy
And who can run the planet? Pass them a Xanax
And n afternoon I annex
And all of the damage [?]
Left on the [?]
Who [?] after all, I guess it's a small world after all
Stunting on the sun, cus I have to ball
I run the world cause it's a small world after all
And I'm never after y'all
I have to loss somethin' and I got it all
And you feeling like you got it all?
[?]
Nah nigga, not at all

[Hook]
Worry 'bout me, don't worry bout me, just worry bout you
And what'chya gon' do?
It'll be a long time, before you ever see me again

[Verse 5]
[?] on the all out, [?] all out [?]
Last summer, last fight, and y'all had a fall out
I can sense [?] what y'all 'bout?
Bumping [?]something, and everything that y'all 'bout
Y'all had your ups and downs, you don't fuck around
Put everything on the [?] something then you go and fuck around
Bet you felt something, now you feel nothing now
Y'all feelings felt something, ya'll don't feel nothing now
Her tears dried up, [?] a specialist
I was under [?] and learning what the lesson is
What the ebony of essences, the Genesis
I got the fetishes, something on the [?]
[?] and you had to look at innocence
I wish we just could take it back to the Book of Genesis
Before the hook is in is there any point of any of this?
[?]
[?] put hands on you, then put his front side and put hands on you
Just turn around say for really? I'm done motherfucker
I [?]

[Hook]
Worry bout me, just worry bout you, I can [?] when I be good
And she said that
It'll be a long time before you ever see me again, me again
Don't worry 'bout me, just worry 'bout you
And I'll be up now, what I've been up to
And it'll be a long time before you ever see me again, me again
Don't worry 'bout me, don't worry 'bout them
And it'll be a long time before you ever see me again, me again
Me again, me again
It'll be a long time before you ever see me again
