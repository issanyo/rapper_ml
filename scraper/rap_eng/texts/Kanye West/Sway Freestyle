[Verse 1: Kanye West]
I can make shit rhyme
I can make shit rhyme if I'm... feel like
And if I, don't... So I just might not, cause I, don't want
And i'm just gonna, freestyle for the first time
With a freestyle, that don't even go together
Ough
No rhymes that's my new shit!
Nothing rhyme!
How that sound!
Uh ohh!
Wap!
You ain't got the answers Sway!
I could sing all, night!
