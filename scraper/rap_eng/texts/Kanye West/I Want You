[Verse 1]
Feels like I'm goin' in circles
You're like a maze I can't get through
Should I go back, should I go back?
Should I let you stay for the night?
It's like a seesaw when it comes to your love
Boy, when you're up, this girl is down
And I just can't figure it out

[Chorus]
'Cause you know that I want you
And you know that I need you
Is that any way to be?
Just have your way with me
My body is cryin'
These tears - can you wipe 'em?
Is that any way to be?
Just have your way with me

[Verse 2]
I'm goin' out with guys I don't wanna go
To places that I've been before
They pitchin' the same game
Boy, it's a damn shame
How I wish it was you callin' me
I want it to be you holdin' me
Boy, it needs to be you kissin' me
'Cause it's like a seesaw, when it comes to your love
Boy, when you're up, this girl is down
And I just can't figure it out

[Chorus]
'Cause you know that I want you
And you know that I need you
Is that any way to be?
Just have your way with me
My body is cryin'
These tears - can you wipe 'em?
Is that any way to be?
Just have your way with me

[Bridge]
Listen
Have your way with me anytime, anywhere
Have your way however, I don't care
Have your way with me
And you can have it tonight
Tonight, tonight, boy, tonight

[Chorus]
'Cause you know that I want you
And you know that I need you
Is that any way to be?
Just have your way with me
My body is cryin'
These tears - can you wipe 'em?
Is that any way to be?
Just have your way with me
'Cause you know that I want you
And you know that I need you
Is that any way to be?
Just have your way with me
My body is cryin'
These tears - can you wipe 'em?
Is that any way to be?
Just have your way with me
