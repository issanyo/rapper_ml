Baby, baby, baby, from the day I saw you
I really really wanted to catch your eye
There's something special 'bout you
And I must really like you
'Cause not a lotta guys are worth my time, no
Ooh baby, baby, baby
It's gettin' kind of crazy
'Cause you are takin' over my mind

And it feels like ooh
But you don't know my name
And I swear
It feels like ooh
But you don't know my name
(Round and round and round we go, will you ever know?)

Baby baby baby
I see us on our first date
You're doing everything that makes me smile, yeah
And when we had our first kiss
It happened on a Thursday
And ooh, it set my soul on fire
Ooh baby baby baby
I can't wait for the first time
My imagination's running wild
And it feels like oooooh
But you don't know my name
And I swear it baby, it feels like oooo ooooo ooooo ooooo
But you don't know my name
(Round and round and round we go, will you ever know)
Break

"See, he don't know what he's doing to me
Got me feeling all type of crazy ways
Got me feeling like uh
Owww! Ooooo Oooooo"

I’m doing more than I've ever done for anyone's attention
Take notice of what's in front of you
‘Cause did I mention, you're 'bout to miss a good thing
And you'll never know how good it feels to have all of my affection
And you'll never get a chance to experience my lovin'
‘Cause my lovin' feels like ooooooo
But you don't know my name
And I swear it feels like oooo ooooo ooooo ooooo
But you don't know my name
(Round and round and round we go, will you ever know)
Ohhh

And it feels like oooooh
But you don't know my name
You don’t know it
And I swear on my mother and father it feels like
Oooo ooo oooo ooo ooo ooo
Oooo ooo oooo ooo ooo ooo
You don't know my name
(Round and round and round we go, will you ever know?)
Will you ever know it? My name…yeah…yeah…yeah
Thank you
