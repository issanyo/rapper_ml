Try love, try love, try love. You see, they’re laughing at me. You heard ’em? They scream at me. They bully me. They bullied me backstage, they said, Don’t go out there with that hat on.
They bullied me backstage. They bullied me! And then they say I’m in a sunken place.
You wanna see the sunken place?
Ok, I’m gonna listen to y’all now.
Or I’m gonna put my superman cape on.
And this means you can’t tell me what to do.
Follow your heart and stop following your mind. That’s how we’re controlled. That’s how we’re programmed.
If you want the world to move forward, try love.
Thank y’all for giving me this platform.
I know some of y’all don’t agree. But y’all be going at that man’s neck a lot, and I don’t think it’s actually that helpful.
I think the universe has balance.
90% of news are liberal.
90% of TV, L.A., New York, writers, rappers, musicians.
So it’s easy to make it seem like it’s so, so, so one-sided. And uh… I am kinda free.
I thought this country said I could be me.
(I love you Kanye)
I love me too.
And I love ya’ll too – so bring the band back!
Bring the band back.
When you feel that, you’ll understand that.
Wave your motherfucking hands up!
I feel good.
