[Verse 1: Diabolic]
You want to blam-blam, keep your hand balanced and pull it
Take your best shot or use your most talented bullet
Black talons and full clips.  I could clap too
You couldn’t catch a body if I threw somebody at you
I’m Strongholding, slap you ‘til my palm’s swollen
Then cut your baby mom open like Ron Goldman
Traum rolled in green-tubed Garcia Vegas
I’m sharp as razors raised with a heartless nature
I don’t care about airing out your parents’ house
‘Til blood splatters on your mom’s Donna Karan blouse
It seems apparent now.  If I’m staring at you
You’d better fall back like someone’s there to catch you
Trust me, ‘Bolic decide what the truth is
The truth is I’m the truth.  Y’all lie in your music
I’ll find it amusing.  That’s to say the least
I say, “It’s beef.”  You hide out and pray for peace
I’ll move next with two TECs, accusing ya
Executioner here to two-step with Lucifer
Stepped into Hell.  Then Heaven just fell
I got questions but I’ll never question myself
See, I’m tipsy, too busy checking my cell
Or in the drunk tank, cops checking my cell
Diabolic.  Always foul when I speak
Shit on you and wipe my ass with this Kanye beat
I’m wild in the street, can’t keep my composure
I don’t see people.  I see people as cobras
Sic the pitbulls, unload clips and hit you
Or pistol-whip you like Shady’s chick just kissed you
My crew will attack.  We staying true to the facts
Stronghold Mixtape Volume 2.  It’s a wrap
