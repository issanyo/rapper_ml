[Intro]
Wassup, wassup, wassup
It's your man DJ PlayForFree getting you through this rush hour
As promised I got that Teyana Taylor "Your Wish is My Command"
On WZUP

[Chorus]
Your wish is my command
(It's like he said to me)
Your wish is my command
(That's ok with me)
Your wish is my command
(Boy don't play with me)
Your wish is my command

[Verse 1]
Are you ready, let's talk about
Said you giving up a piece of your heart
I want to see it, oh walk that walk
Boy I want to be blown away

[Bridge]
In love a lot of love
There here and gone the next day
I've been there done there over this thing
You say you feeling me
You never had a woman like this
I hear you but it's hard to really hear you
Oh he said

[Chorus]
Your wish is my command
(It's like he said to me)
Your wish is my command
(That's ok with me)
Your wish is my command
(Boy don't play with me)
Your wish is my command

[Verse 2]
Lately, you've been on it
Got me really thinking you were heart
If you say it, you better mean it
Don't be saying that it's love, it's not
Oh he say

[Bridge]
In love a lot of love
There here and gone the next day
I've been there done there over this thing
You say you feeling me
You never had a woman like this
I hear you but it's hard to really hear you
Oh he said

[Chorus]
Your wish is my command
(It's like he said to me)
Your wish is my command
(That's ok with me)
Your wish is my command
(Boy don't play with me)
Your wish is my command
