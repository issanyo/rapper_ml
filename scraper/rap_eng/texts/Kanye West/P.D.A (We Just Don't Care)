[Chorus]
Let's go to the park
I wanna kiss you underneath the stars
Maybe we'll go too far, we just don't care
We just don't care, we just don't care

[Verse 1]
You know I love it when you're loving me
Sometimes it's better when it's publicly
I'm not ashamed, I don't care who sees
Just hugging and kissing our love exhibition
We rendezvous up on the fire escape
I like to set off an alarm today
The love emergency don't make me wait
Just follow I'll lead you, I urgently need you

[Chorus]
Let's go to the park
I wanna kiss you underneath the stars
Maybe we'll go too far, we just don't care
We just don't care, we just don't care

Let's make love
Let's go somewhere, they might discover us
Let's get lost in lust, we just don't care
We just don't care, we just don't care

[Verse 2]
I see you closing down the restaurant
Let's sneak and do it when your boss is gone
Everybody's leaving we'll have some fun
Or maybe it's wrong but you're turnin' me on
Ooh, we'll take a visit to your mama's house
Creep to the bedroom while your mama's out
Maybe she'll hear it when we scream and shout
But we'll keep it rocking until she comes knocking

[Chorus]
Let's go to the park
I wanna kiss you underneath the stars
Maybe we'll go too far, we just don't care
We just don't care, we just don't care

Let's make love
Let's go somewhere, they might discover us
Let's get lost in lust, we just don't care
We just don't care, we just don't care

[Bridge]
If we keep up on this fooling around
We'll be the talk of the town
I'll tell the world I've a love in the town
Let's open the blinds cause we really don't mind

[Verse 3]
Ooh, I don't care about the priority
Let's break the rules, ignore society
Maybe all neighbor want to spy us too
So what if they watch when we do, what we do

[Chorus]
Let's go to the park
I wanna kiss you underneath the stars
Maybe we'll go too far, we just don't care
We just don't care, we just don't

Let's make love
Let's go somewhere, they might discover us
Let's get lost in lust
