[Kanye West - Alternative Second Verse]
The brown hero, live from Ground Zero
Machine gun flow, made of ghetto Ross Perot
And this is disestablishmen-tarianism
With my night goggles on, yeah, military vision
And it’s still a very Christian way to think about livin’
When you prayin’ for freedom ’cause your mind been in prison
‘Cause they tryin’ to control every single big decision
You ain’t effin’ the system, then why the eff is you livin’?
Look, dawg, you can cop whatever suits you on
Three-piece, cuff links and the accoutrements
They been feedin’ us ish without the nutrients
So I’m back with another hit to let the truth be known
And your boy still fresh with the Gucci on
Them Italians sure know how to make what the moulies want
And they really can’t take what dude be on
But I be on the same thing ’til you prove me wrong
