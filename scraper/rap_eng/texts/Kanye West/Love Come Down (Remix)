You are now listenin to the sounds of Dirty Money
{You are now listening to the sounds, of Dirty Money}
Yo, turn me up a lil' bit

[Diddy - rap verse]
London, Paris, where we goin next?
Shit~! I don't know, what planet would you suggest? (Don't stop)
Wherever we go you just bring a little dress
And I'll just take care o'all the rest (Let's go)
I feel like affection, I'm givin you my best
I'm underestimated as the greatest one left
So if you ready to fly, better take a deep breath
I put you in the sky and take yo' heart up outcha chest
Now you got me goin in... -- (in-sane)
We can sit under the sun until your skin change
Now whatchu REALLY know about ownin a big plane?
Landin on the Autobahn's, come with champagne
Ain't that a damn shame? C'mon

[Bridge - Kaleena]
I want a feeling I can feel
I want a love, I know, is real
I can't believe, this is happenin to me
Baby right here is where I wanna BEEEEEEE...

[Jay-Z sample]

{You are now listening to the sounds, of Dirty Money}

You make my love come down... {Dirty Money Crew}
I feel you love me now... Oh-oh!

[Diddy]
Aiyyo, aiyyo
I ain't finished wit you
Now the funny thing is that the world stop spinnin
When my energy in the air
You could sell the world twice, still never compare
+Been Around the World+ so many times, I got my own atmosphere
Now, London, Paris, where we goin next?
I don't know, what planet would you suggest?
Wherever we go you just bring a little dress
And I'll just take care o'all the rest
Dirty Money, c'mon

[Outro]
(Baby, can you love me dooooooooooooooown?)
Baby, can you love me down?
(Everything, you give me alllllllllllll)
Can you give me all

[Diddy]
