What in the fuck was that, Kanye?! I told you to do some shit for the kids! You can give me your muthafuckin' graduation ticket right now! You give me this muthafuckin' robe before you catch some senioritis! You will not walk across that stage, you won’t slide across that stage! A muthafucka can’t pull you across that stage, Kanye! Who told you? See, I told you to do somethin' uplifting! I’m tryin' to get you out here with these white people and this how you're gonna do me! You know what, you's a nigga. And I don’t mean that in no nice way. Had little kids sing about the shit, the jokes on you. You throw your muthafuckin hands in the air, and wave good-bye to every-mothafuckin-body! Cause you gettin' the fuck out of this campus! What the fuck you gon' do now, Kanye?

I'm no longer confused, but don't tell anybody
I'm about to break the rules, but don't tell anybody
I got something better than school, but don't tell anybody
My momma would kill me, but don't tell anybody
She wants me to get a good ass job, just like everybody
She ain't walked in my shoes, I'm just not everybody
