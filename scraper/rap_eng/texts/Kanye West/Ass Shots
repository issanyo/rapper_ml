[Intro: Kanye West]
I don't know why niggas tripping on a nigga
For clippers, I hate you niggas too
But I'm black and Mexican, we gon' change that, haha
I hate you niggas too!

[Hook: Kanye West]
If you ain't had good pussy, nigga, try some
Your girl ain't got no ass, she need to buy one
Out west, Southwest, where you fly from
New Jersey, Teterboro where I fly from
You ain't got no Ghost, you need to drive one
That bitch is so broke, try to find some
And she ain't got no money, tryna find some
I swear these bitches funny, hahaha
Hahaha, hahaha
I swear these bitches funny, hahaha
Hahaha, hahaha
You still owe me money, nigga, yeah, yeah

[Verse 1: French Montana]
Got a bad bitch at build-a-body
Get a bad bitch and build a body
When your pop, the slim nigga shady
When your pop was Slim, I was Baby
I came for them chips like I'm K.D
Came for them bricks like I'm Maisie
We hit up the trap which is booming
Hustle, French John Newman
Fuck making the move, we the movie
Fuck the whole group, I'm a groupie
All that money rolling through the lobby
VVS is dripping off my body
You can do what you want when you got it
Go get a bitch and then build her body
They wanted Versace Milan
We do what we want and then copy
Smack a Roley on my arm
Skrrr, middle fingers to the feds
Put a hundred dollars on your head
Price of life hit you
And all my dawgs gotta eat
And all the money get divided
Snipe game be the wildest
Get a bad bitch, build her body
Get a bad bitch, build her body, haan

[Hook: Kanye West]

[Verse 2: Cam'ron]
Harlem to the death, I'mma forever front
A problem with the kid is what you never want
That's what you want, I had my niggas waiting for you
Like you sitting at a table in a restaurant
Slice you like pizza, I keep six in the squeezer
My jewelry is nice, dressing is iced
It's how you can sit in the freezer
Keep my dick in the diva, word, no problem licking it either
Baby girl could be a believer, we could just kick it like FIFA
All the women heavy like pallbearer
That Henney got that cake like Carvel
Carvel, me, I'mma die
Inside the pussy, man, I know just how Lamar felt
My bitch sit on me flat without no tummy tuck
She no stripper but all she do is pick money up
Five-o called me over, word to my homie, I ain't tell 'em shit
He seemed aggy, so all I did was tell him this
