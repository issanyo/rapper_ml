Nobody's perfect

[Hook]
(Please don't let me)
Die before repenting my sin
(Please don't let me)
Drink and drive ever again
(Please don't let me)
Ever smoke meth or crack
(Please don't let me)
Get HIV with no get back
(Please don't let me)
Don't let me fail
(Please don't let me)
Ever spend another second in jail
(Please don't let me)
Come this far to fall off
Please don't let me fuck mine off

[Verse 1]
I got vices I like, like vodka on the rocks
Catch me at some Grammy party next to Jaime Fox
I'm not, marriage material, more like Heff
I got knowledge of self, I'm sorta Mos Def
Except, I'm a slut for a pretty-faced bitch
Youngin used to say I got a lust demon trick
Consequences every lifestyle you living
Some rappers got herpes, the gift that keeps on giving
Even worse than that
I seen people go too far and can't come back
Straight guys tricked by transvestites, sick
Be careful who you let suck on your dick
That bitch might be a boy
I be frisking hoes in the club, I'm paranoid
I don't exercise and that's bad with black folks
Hypertension, heart disease, heart attacks, strokes

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
All my ex girls, say I'm selfish
Shit, we in a recession, I need help, bitch
Rent too damn high, I need help, bitch
Pour the Doc, no pork, but I eat shellfish
And I ain't looking for beef
But bitch niggas get money, and think shit is sweet
I ain't taking no L's, we keeping it street
Both sides pack heat, let the grim reaper reap
And as far as rap concerned
I don't feel like talking, homie, I'm taciturn
Industry blackball wouldn't give Ras a turn
But I'm the best nigga rapping, write classic burns
And y'all dickride rappers who don't even write they own raps
What kind of rapper is that?
Multi-talented, overcame my challenges
Don't bring me here just to die like Richie Valens did

[Hook]

[Outro]
No
Apollo Brown
What up my nigga?
I ain't even gonna lie, bro
I'm sometimes my own worst enemy
Most times my own worst enemy
