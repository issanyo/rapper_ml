[Intro: Planet Asia]
Knahmean? Forever M.C., ya mean?
This how we do this shit G, word
Can't stay on the plantation forever, knahmean?
Shout out to my nigga Ras Kass
Immortal Technique, hmm

[Verse 1: Planet Asia]
Graphed of the madness, gladiator status, mold the data
While I blow minds like big bowls that shatter
Catapult quotes, electric volts
Shoot .45-Colt speed, one-time can never catch a ghost
I'm in the streets movin' militant
What a time to be alive, let's experiment
We takin' no shorts
Rides in the streets up against the forces that be, blood-suckers of the poor
You want a war, well fuck it let's get it on
I got nothin to lose, quality of life is what we aimin for
Peace to the civilized, my enterprise is movin
Showin' and provin', that it's lucrative to run a movement
Beats I keep scorchin'
My beginnin' is land royalty rich, African natural resources
Was it the past that got me caught in a curse?
Or was it because my queen was the salt of the earth?
They'd rather have me in the cage 'til I'm schizophrenic
They don't wanna see us rich with families
It's only one solution, where you fit in, get
Go for yours and if you ever feel like your life is threatened empty ya clip

[Hook - Chuck D]
He might not be king but he's one type of man
Kill men, rape the women, took the land
Type of man stole souls
Is it the greed of man? Kill 'til they all alone
Could build a college built on skull and bones
Callin' other men "boy" when they grown
Mass graves, with no headstones
My brother we'll may never know (never know)

[Verse 2 - Ras Kass]
Applause, uh, salute my nigga (baow)
I speak life, communion red wine on the mic
Blood money and Cristal became the body of Christ
Shaytan, I'm outta your vice, prophecy is fulfilled
Captain America died so I'm keepin' his shield
Y'all stay in the house, we knee-deep in the field
Peepin' they yield, Nat Turner and we finna kill
Black burner, attach the fact learner, we finna build
Heaven help me, no games, I'm Meek with a Mill
Blessed what I wrote, spit carcinogens from cancer I smoke
Goat, and it's just the flesh what I quote
So, ashes to ashes, dust to PCP
Good-hearted fella released from the CDC
(???), I ate rappers for ECC
9-7-1-9-0, completely free
I put on for my city, serve truth
And you could fight jackin' off while hangin' like kung-fu, nigga

[Hook - Chuck D]
He might not be king but he's one type of man
Kill men, rape the women, took the land
Type of man stole souls
Is it the greed of man? Kill 'til they all alone
Could build a college built on skull and bones
Callin' other men "boy" when they grown
Mass graves, with no headstones
My brother we'll may never know (never know)

[Verse 3 - Bronze Nazareth]
A'ight P-K-7, listen
Bury me in stardust, too much has been seen
I tied with bullets, my pews is concrete
Good rule, club rounds, smoke a asphalt leaf
What I say more than how it's said, turn pastors to fiends
Inside my mind is a disaster scene
Flashes of mental passes and my brother's last scream
My head steams, I want revenge for Laquan
And a bronze diamond-studded chain to remind me of God
I pray to myself, load and spray it myself
I found myself when I'm waitin', I'll make him his dealt
Walk through the fire, emotion niggas cop out a feel
I'm off the third rail, laughin' and leakin' L
There go producer M.C., complete your will
Wrote sutures in crack, the street get peeled
This bittersweet calligraphy should equal hundred mil'
But my ill street blues got sequels still

[Hook - Chuck D]
