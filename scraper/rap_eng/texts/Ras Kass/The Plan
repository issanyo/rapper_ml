Oh
More cowbell
Ha ha ha
Shit is so nostalgic
Yeah

I'm feeling like LL
Fuck the bells 2012
Ghost riding nigga, I be spitting how shells
Ya'll bastards can burn in hell
I'm the California Christ
Jesus feeding hand with the nails
Rap faggots, don't ask don't tell
I flush you out the bush like a cracker hunting quail
Used to be a jailbird, now I just pteradactyl
Shit these rappers say keep smelling like mackerel
Sounds fishy 'cause the truth ain't in you
When I read soundscan, all I see is a menu
Kindle (?)
When I crash in the paper its the evil that men do
This shit crack like the liberty bell
I got a ginger bitch, nickname: Yosemite Sam
I pull my borthers up, just give me a hand
I'm with the revolution comrade, just give me the plan
