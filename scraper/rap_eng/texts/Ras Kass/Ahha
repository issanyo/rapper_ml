[Intro: Ras Kass]
Ah!

Ya know

DJ Da Boy

Brooklyn's Onasis
It goes:

[Hook: Ras Kass]
Ahha!
If you like the way it goes, keep it ra-ra!
Big drank, money and hoes! Look at ma-ma!
Ooh-wee! Losing her clothes. You get na-da!
Bitch please go work them poles!
Ahha!
If you like the way it goes, keep it ra-ra!
Big drank, money and hoes! Look at ma-ma!
Ooh-wee! Losing her clothes. You get na-da!
Go work them Cap'n-Save-a-Hoes!

[Verse One: Ras Kass]
These niggas rowdy-rowdy!
Never rains in Southern Cali -- only cloudy! How we
Hit the Valley in black Denalis like I am Johnny Gotti's
Street army that rock Armani!
Sorry somebody's baby mammy got fucked liked Oochie Wally Wally!
Probably, I'll be
Arriving tardy at my platinum party --
Poppin' wheelies on a Ducati! {phew!}
Bacardi got me
Arrogant, grouchy and cocky like jockey
I be too complicated to copy;
Can't stop me or cock-block me
Or block this craving for broccoli
My nuts' too big homey; they got me walking nutty!
I pop three collars at a time --
That's mine, my dime's, and every rhyme -- oh whoa!

[Hook]

[Verse Two: Ras Kass]
So quick, so fast:
Young niggas in the street is quick to blast
So get your cash up, mash, and sag your pants
See that's fo' sho'

They don't build niggas like us no more!
Cops better be robo -- we refuse to move slow!
Ye know!
Rassy Kassy at the Hard Rock Café
With Floyd Mayweather, cussin out the valet
Shoes by Bally keep a nigga on his toes like ballet
Keeps a bitch like Cali? next to me now I shoot a movie
Or I slang with big drinks, big smokes, basically big thangs!
So kick rocks before we get in your ass like shit stains!
Bitch jock aka we switch names!
I am Dante, ain't really that much more to say
I speak latex -- let my plastic talk like parquet
Sumamabitch! That's how I lost my ex-fiancée;
She said, "Say my name!," then I came, and yelled "Beyoncé!"

[Hook]
