[Intro]
Yeah, squeeze the juice out the headphones to this

[Verse 1]
Classic, I'm on my backpack ratchet
Spillin' Jack Daniel's on my Bloodbath jacket
Uh huh, that's called cross brandin'
Like a little old lady with a rosary in her hand and
Cheerin' Pope Fran while she standin' in the Vatican
I'm coppin' Gucci sneakers, speakin' Latin up on Madison
And 5th, Trayvon Martin hoodie on
Fuck police, we singin' the sizzle piggy song
Die piggy piggy, fry, bacon
Kevin, degrees, 187
Legend, Caesar with the half moon cresent
Order the pheasant, throw scraps to the peasants
But on a brighter note
Bitch up on shrooms, he saw kaleidoscopes
Shout out the rappers in my liner notes
And all the fly ladies who vagina dope with pretty faces
Love women too much to be racist
Don Sterling got banned for life
So fuck him and his wife
Brown, black, or white, fuck what haters think
'Cause last time I checked, all pussy is pink

[Hook]
Chocolate on the outside, strawberry on the inside
Vanilla on the outside, strawberry on the inside
Galletas on the outside, strawberry on the inside
Gelato on the outside, strawberry on the inside
Mochi on the outside, strawberry on the inside
Yogurt on the outside, strawberry on the inside
Mac Daddy with a stable, got bitches galore
I walk in the room and drag my dick on the floor

[Verse 2]
Uh, and I walk with a bop
New Years Eve every day, like the ball, she drop
You funny niggas small as Hart
Next bar; rap falls apart like malls with Blart
Glass crashin' like Mazel Tov
Chart to top, then I'm not fallin' off
You could say that I fell on, was most underrated
Had a nice list of some celeb chicks, I fornicated with
Coming from Alaska
Strawberry Shasta, yeah, I'm a bastard
Rock yellow gold, to rep the Golden State
Diego, Sac, to Fresno, the Golden Gate
Ask my nigga Cleatus Mac, Ras P back east
From flows to the hoes, Razzy Kazzy been a beast
Red, yellow, brown, fuck what haters think
'Cause last time I checked, all pussy is pink

[Hook]
Chocolate on the outside, strawberry on the inside
Vanilla on the outside, strawberry on the inside
Galletas on the outside, strawberry on the inside
Gelato on the outside, strawberry on the inside
Mochi on the outside, strawberry on the inside
Yogurt on the outside, strawberry on the inside
Mac Daddy with a stable, got bitches galore
I walk in the room and drag my dick on the floor

[Outro]
Yeah (Strawberry on the inside)
What up, Meth? It's like "Ice Cream, Pt. 2," nigga
(Strawberry on the inside)
Shouts out to my butter pecan 'Ricans...
My pi√±a coladas, my sherberts, my sorbets, haha
(Strawberry on the inside, strawberry on the inside)
