[Verse 1: Apathy]
Don't touch that dial, these rappers tunin' into my style
I'm turning into some vile human beings eating bile
From a corpse, Larry Bird on the basketball courts
I'm East Coast as Puerto Ricans smokin' Newports in Jorts
I'm the Human Torch, flames flicker on my skin
Head covered in pins like Hellraiser, my sins
Are far too numerous to mention, let's just say that I'm fucked
I'm on a highway to hell inside a gasoline truck
I got hoes on my dick, pussy pics in my inbox
A drawer full of fangs more powerful than Grimlock's
I'm Mike Tyson rib shots, I'm bright like the Gremlins
I'm Michael Knight revvin' KITT's engine and assemblin'
A Kalashnikov stormin' the Kremlin
Benchpressin' a Soviet missile, I got a posse of henchmen
Recruited from an alternate time another dimension
I brought down the earth with my scientific invention

[Hook: Apathy]
Livin' life like, I never know if the sun will rise
Look me in the eyes, this is all I got
Bunch of notebooks, songs with no hooks
The Genesis, God said, "Let there be light"
Livin' life like, I never know if the sun will rise
Look me in the eyes, this is all I got
Bunch of notebooks, songs with no hooks
The Genesis, God said, "Let there be light"

[Verse 2: Ras Kass]
When 27 my young jawn in the bed and so I'm headin'
To the headphones pressin' the pencil lead, back to the drawin' board
We were skaters then I'll be shreddin', (720 gazelle flip), I'll make it look easy they break a leg
And I'm eggin' 'em on, like break a leg and sing 'em a song
I'm John Legend, the new John Lennon, I'm rhyme legend
Some niggas like every line pregnant, combine segments
Cellular mitosis, the building blocks of creation, divine tetris
I design the outdoor room with no exits, to entertain Cedrics
All in the genetics not the Edison Electrics
If I stomp you with my Nikes I can cross it off my checklist
They left us the underworld not even supposed to survive here
Underground hip hop, we thrive here
Chemistry, C.T., let's cruise like a PT
Apathy, Ras Kass and O.C

[Hook: Apathy]
Livin' life like, I never know if the sun will rise
Look me in the eyes, this is all I got
Bunch of notebooks, songs with no hooks
The Genesis, God said, "Let there be light"
Livin' life like, I never know if the sun will rise
Look me in the eyes, this is all I got
Bunch of notebooks, songs with no hooks
The Genesis, God said, "Let there be light"

[Verse 3: O.C.]
When Ap sent out the beacon my pen was ready
Verbal variables with attitudes
When ideas get to spinnin' for a song
It's negated by the bars and my peers this just the tone
Listen to the voices hit notes blend with the flow
Faint sound of xylophones, pen left and right
Vocal sound as if I'm writing me a [?]
Peep the monotone, after my sixteen's done
I fold it and place it inside an envelope
Postmark it, first class overnighted back to Gatsby
It's no race but I call it a track meet
Anchor to the song's finale, the baton
Passed to me by Ras Kass, lead off by Apathy
When that starter pistol rang and his feet left the blocks
Via Flash, Jay Garrick all rappers saw was a blur
Too quick for the mind's eye to deny
Non-confirmed release date, to be determined, got these rappers nervous

[Hook: Apathy]
Livin' life like, I never know if the sun will rise
Look me in the eyes, this is all I got
Bunch of notebooks, songs with no hooks
The Genesis, God said, "Let there be light"
Livin' life like, I never know if the sun will rise
Look me in the eyes, this is all I got
Bunch of notebooks, songs with no hooks
The Genesis, God said, "Let there be light"

[Outro: Rass Kass]
Yeah, O.C., Apathy, RK
It's another day man. Let there be light
Roll that spliff up. Let there be light
Yeah, we're rocking out

[Sample: Theatre West]
"We are the children of tomorrow's dream"

[Rass Kass]
This shit feels like UFOs and shit, like aliens nigga
