[Verse 1: Ras Kass]
How A 6’4 Manwhore gone take me to war?
You gotta marshmallow core Ima make me a smores
Couldn’t knock me out! Gave me 2Pac clout
Hit me from behind with a bottle, couldn’t knock me out?!
Ima 5’8 gameboy Icey watch, REUP still hanging form my chain boy
White sweater no blood stains boy
Game over
I rolled dolo outside went up to ya rangerover
Told ya “I got ya” undercover cops came over
LA love me plus my spit flame nova
Got that wrinkled ass forehead so Ima maime Yoda
Dog my aim colder
When we get at you…
You are truly got butterfly eye bet his Asshole got that Rainbow tattoo
Crotch filled wit cock this the dick in ya mouth
And this ain't the first time you been on my young jock
Remember you was tryin to rap for me on the ‘Shaw
Now you lyin on the net claim you broke my jaw fool!
I ain't sounding like Kanye West
Bitch nigga I rep Cali this that Bombai best
Walked the mainline, you walked the soul train line
Yeast infection his khaki thong is on too tight
And something ain't right-fuck 300 bars
I’d already locked behind 300 bars
And still might be
For murking this fake ass B L double O D
Lancaster ain't close to Compton mayn
& Caz from 6 0 want to know why you scared to catch that fade
You already dead so now I gotta disturb you
And the truth is the whole coast want me to serve you

[Verse 2: Ras Kass]
Hey ya”ll Game on publicity stunt
Cuz Doc (Dre) don’t fuck with him, city call him a punk
And he don’t go out without paying street taxes
So he got a few real niggas he bribed to be active
This the same JT from “change of heart”
Your bitch said you cried a lot and you played the part
Then your bitch went on a date had a “change of heart”
Ima put something in your chest bitch and change your heart
You gonna need a transplant, really have a change of heart
From a stripper so you end the same way you start
“Doejer”
No tats JT, just buttoned down hawaiin shirts and kool-aid smiles
Streets of LA can’t believe you now
Even your own brother say you ain't reputable
And word on the street you gonna end up a vegetable
You past tense, Ima make your bobble head collectable
Pathological liar, said I mentioned your son by name
See fame shows the world who lame
And I still don’t know your son’s name but I do know this
It’s a shame that his father’s a bitch
You thought you was going to pin-the-tail on the donkey
But Ima Asshole, nigga you shook your ass like a monkey
G A M E, we gonna drop the M E
Just like you tried to drop me
Now it’s just G A, and we gone add the letter Y
And lets play, the game is officially just GAY
