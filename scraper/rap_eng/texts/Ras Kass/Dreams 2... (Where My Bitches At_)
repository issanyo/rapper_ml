Intro: Ras Kass

That's some real shit
Sometimes I be watching, you know what I'm saying
The little videos and shit
I just be trying to imagine them bitches fuck faces, you know?
I can't help it dog, I got dreams too (what)
Yo Doo Wop, what's wrong with a nigga?
Tell B.I.G. rest in peace

Verse One: Ras Kass

As I sit back relax drinkin Alize and 'Yak (Cognac)
And lust over R&B bitches with wide gaps
I fantasize at night if I can up Lauryn Hill
Just to show her how that thing really feel
It's really ill what the dilly with T-Boz and Chili?
I'd rather have this big dick than a Big Willie
Cause TLC know they love Scrubs
I fuck Left Eye in the passenger seat of my man VW Bug
Wanna G Alliyah
But Mya look flyer
BIG said she looked scary but I'd still fuck Mariah
Shanice is a piece plus the pussy is deep
Kelly Price look aight but she to obese
To say the least
Veronica's skins is in the top ten
Don't need a dildo to break Monifah shit again
Deborah Cox is hot let me lick that pussy up
I had a crush on you since MTV The Cut
What?
I'm just chinky eyed chocately cute
The girl is mine me and Monica knockin' da boots
As Brandy too crew
She like it wow from the back
Getting her braids pulled while her ass get smacked
Remember Fresh Prince, Tatyana Ali
Now she old enough to pee so now she old enough for me homey
Late night with a fifth of JD's whisky
'Cause I gotta be pissy drunk to fuck that bitch Missy

Chorus: Doo Wop (repeat 4X)

Where my bitches at?
From the front to back I wanna hit that

Verse Two: Ras Kass

Fuck some Taco Bell, "Yo quiero Jennifer Lopez"
Fat ass dough legs I switch my last name to Ropez
It's true, I love 702
Divine got hazel eyes, bang em blind like Mr Magoo
Erykah Badu is cool but 'Dre is my dog
Got the Spice Girls taking turns hummin' my balls
Tell me what's the Total when the niggas attract
Kima and Keisha in a menage with Pam and Da Brat
Has to escape Xscape they was trying to rape me
Raven Symone is statutory wait until she 18
I'd bang all 3 cuties from Blaque, believe that
Without make-up Elusion is wack like two fuckin sleestacks
Chante Moore fly though but she probably know Tae-Bo
Destiny's Child is wild plus I want to try 4, wait
Who's them five white bitches wearing pink, hah
My bad that's them 'niggas' N'Sync
I'd bang Les Nubians from France to the Motherland
Stretch Mona Lisa like a rubber band with no rubber man
Faith is off limits but Mary J can get it
Them big ass lips known to cold suck a good dit-ick
One little black ass core but I like my chickens extra crispy
Slide down Whitney and her mom Sissy
But Bobby probably kill so chill
Had Tamia walking wobbly stealing meals from Grant Hill

Chorus
