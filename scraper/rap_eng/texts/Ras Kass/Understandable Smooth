For the live ones, not the shook ones
For the riders, not the hook ones

Immaculate conception, like a black Madonna in mangers;
My crew consist of millionaires, failures, and gangbangers
Say my name like Candyman
Then I'm creepin' out the cut with a gallon in hand
I span 49 states, bounce rock skate;
Similar to movin' weight out of state
Lyrics lacerate spinal columns, "I bury all cockroaches";
Stare in his face, Stomp-in on bustas like Kirk Franklin
Intrigued by the speed of a 911 Porsche? But of course
Still screaming "Behold a pale horse."
Watch my flame turn green like a Promethean torch;
Pay no child support when me and my mic divorce
Some of y'all cats in the game look confused;
Where's your butterfly collar and your crocodile shoes?
Gotta pay dues, street crews â€” you know it's off the hook when
Oh-three-one is gangbangin' in Brooklyn ...

I puff the Black & Mild, crusin on a Harley -- flickin ashes
Givin crazy baldheads the finger like Bob Marley
Suaver than synthetic players, that's my word
See ever since the days of Turkish gold chains and cross cords
Uncle Sam wanna play me on some
"All you people do is get on welfare and have crack babies"
Yeah maybe, but a lot of po-po is racists
They keep a brother fightin federal cases, "ju know"
I'm sick of gettin the short end of the stick -- so I sharpen it...
And stuck Ron Goldman
If ain't nothing wrong, something just ain't right
Sometimes I'd rather have two dykes than five mics
See I'm fat, my shit is mo' John Blaze than that
I got John Blaze shit, and then I was un-recognized, and then fuck that
Who is you to be askin me questions?
Bustin caps in nine-eight, exposin niggas intestines

Now if I ever fall off, then take a picture trick
But I'ma play Dennis Rodman and kick you in the... damn!
Hip-hop smoothed out on the R&B tip, with a pop feel appeal to it
I'm so for real to it
I cream it, wet dream it
Support it like a Wonder Bra, when I bust like cleavage
Eff a spot lock up, I rock three-quarter top Nikes
On the handlebars of the homey beach cruser bike
Fifty-thousand dollar warrants, just-us/justice, no peace
No bail, no release, from Inglewood court
South to La Brea then East to the pen;
Handcuffed, I shoulda jumped off the roof like Mack 10
Create the funny styles with the chokers round the neck
Flossin' at the chest hairs in a sequined vest
Ras Kass-a-nova, Don Juan, the phenomenon
You know I'm the bomb, I raise hell like Spawn ...
