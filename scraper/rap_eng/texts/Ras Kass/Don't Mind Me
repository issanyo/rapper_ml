[Intro: Cee]
Let’s get it
Cee, Rasy, TMF Bitch ah
Listen

[Verse 1: Cee]
I once heard that a learned man acts like he's all that
But a wise man admit it when he's wrong coz if he slippin' then he fall back
So please don't mind me, I try to be the latter
Forgive me family, believe it that my reason matters
I mean well, I'm only working just to better y'all
My methods ain't the best but it's hurting if I ain't get involved
My skin forever blessed with the Fam now, I'm damn proud
So fuck a fad, how we be fitting in tryina stand out?
So don't mind my ways, get a little bit tired these days
Sick of dealing with the dramas, don't let it get to me, hardly I'm phased
I couldn't be more focused
Man what more can I say? Nothing else matters and this is my Black Album opus
So watch us close kid
My dues paid, me and Notion through playing, the crew changed and they saying that we the dopest
All the struggles bring us closer, we a Movement, see
We keep it comin', its fuckin' nothing so don't mind me, yeah

[Hook: Bekah]
Look at us now
We’re heading in the right direction
Everything happens for a reason
Don’t you know
So don’t mind me
Everything I do is for you and I’m loving you forever don’t you see

[Verse 2: Ras Kass]
Live and let live, I’m not perfect but I twerk it
You wanna see me jumping through flaming hoops like the circus
I am not a toy, you see what that tiger did to Roy?
Go play with Woody, I’m the Real McCoy
I’m not tryina change you
And I can be irritated by some of the vain shit that you do
Way I always saw it, the good outweighs the bad
‘Til you treat me like a private in Vietnam tryina raise the flag
Out of sight, out of time
Forgive me if I’m out of line
[Bekah] I don’t mind yeah
I just wanna make you mine, but you can’t change me
I’ma stay up on my grind, girl you can’t blame me
Trying not to start a fight, you keep the drama going
She tryina make a scene ‘til the whole damn club is knowin’
So close to leave, honestly I’m supposed to leave
So either get over it or be forced to get over me

[Hook: Bekah]
Look at us now
We’re heading in the right direction
Everything happens for a reason
Don’t you know
So don’t mind me
Everything I do is for you and I’m loving you forever don’t you see

[Verse 3: Cee]
And don't ya see that?
I'm motivated by love, I've given everything up so I can succeed at
Just being that Cee cat, the path is hella hard
But nothing easy be worth achieving, so I'm regretting none
And baby if I'm getting worked up and I'm nervous
It's just that I'm excited and impatient when the work comes
And it's urgent, coz me and my lady, we skating never
I'm a movement by myself but we a force when we together
And yo, so don't mind me, with this hindsight, I'ma sightsee
And this limelight finna blind me, but my mind right and my heart's at ease
And I, want it more now, wanna tour now, wanna see her smile, wanna see y'all proud
Stage tore down, records sold out, big tings homeboy, I want it all now
Yeah, we always been the motherfuckin' underdog
And now the kid has got ya ready for the summer y'all
Ya wanna know just why we do it? Just ask us
We relentless with this effortless passion, homie don't mind me

[Hook: Bekah]
Look at us now
We’re heading in the right direction
Everything happens for a reason
Don’t you know
So don’t mind me
Everything I do is for you and I’m loving you forever don’t you see
