[Verse]
Let freedom ring with a buckshot, but not just yet
First, we need to truly understand the nature of the threat
And a pale man walks in the threshold of darkness
Roughly 20,000 years ago the first humans evolved
With the phenotypical trait, genetic recessive
Blue eyes, blonde hair and white skin
Albinism apparently was a sin to the original man, Africans
So the mutants traveled North of the equator
Called Europeans later, the first race haters
So here's the Devil's alpha to the beta
'Cause history's best qualified to teach one
Quoting German philosopher Schopenhauer
"Every white man is a faded or a bleached one"
Migration created further mutation
Genetic drifts, evolution through recombination
Adaptation to the climate
As the Caucus mountain man reverted to that of a primate
Savage Neanderthals, until the late Paleolithic age
That's when the black Grimaldi man came
With the symbol of the dragon, fire and art
Check cave paintings in France and Spain to the Venus of Willendorf
Around 2000 B.C. Southern Russians migrate in small units
Those who travel West populated Europe
Those who went East settled in Iran, known as Aryans
1500 B.C. some crossed the Khyber Pass into India and
Created Hinduism, the first caste system, the origins of racism
A white dot on the forehead meant elite
The black dot - defeat; untrustable, untouchables
They wrote the holy Vedas in Sanskrit
That's the language that created Greek, German, Latin and English
Now the Minoans around 2000 B.C
Starts on the island of Crete in the Agean Sea
The Greek culture begins Western civilization
But "Western civilization" means "white domination"
Mycenaeans learned from Kemet, called Egypt in Greek
It existed since at least 3000 B.C
Creatin' geometry and astronomy
This knowledge influenced Plato, Socrates and Hippocrates
'Cause Imhotep, the real father of medicine
Was worshiped in Greece and Rome in the form of a black African
The word Africa comes from the Greek "Aphrike"
Meaning "without cold"
The word philosophy means "love of knowledge"
Stole from first man, Greek power expands
The first Greek fraternities band
The word gymnasium is Greek for "naked"
This was the place where adolescent boys were educated, and molested
This was accepted because Greek culture was homosexual
For example, Sappho trained girls on the island of Lesbos;
Hence, the word Lesbian (ey, let these dumb motherfuckers know!)
December 25th, the birth of Saturn
A homosexual god, now check the historical pattern
December 25th, now thought the birth of Christ
Was Saturnalia, when men got drunk
Fucked each other then beat their wife
Fact is, it was still practiced, 'til they called it Christmas
So put a gerbil on your Christmas list
The Hellenistic Era, Alexander the Great
Conquers all the way to India leavin' four successor states
By the Fifth century B.C., R.O.M.E
Succeeds to be the conqueror of Egypt and Greece
But had the threat of the black Phoenicians in Sicily
The Punic Wars begin, 264 B.C
The black general Hannibal and Carthaginian Peace
In 146 B.C. Carthage fell after a six-month siege
Rome sold every citizen to slavery
The first genocide of history
And more bisexuality in sight; Julius Caesar was known as
"every woman's husband and every man's wife"
Spartacus Revolt, a slave rebellion that lost
Where 6,000 slaves was nailed on a cross
Cross, aw, shit, Jesus Christ, time for some act-right
Christians get your facts right
'Cause Christ was not his name, that's Greek for "One who is anointed"
Yeshua Ben Yosef was his name, do Christians know this?
So who do you praise? Do you know his name?
Or do you do this in vain?
Accepting the religion they gave slaves to behave?
Peep the description of historian Josephus
"Short, dark, with an underdeveloped beard was Jesus"
He had the Romans fearin' revolution
The solution was to take him to court and falsely accuse him
After being murdered by Pilate how can it be
These same white Romans established Christianity
Constantine would later see the cross in a dream
In his vision, it read In hoc signo vinces
"In this sign we conquer" - Manifest Destiny
In 325 he convened the Nicene Creed
And separated god into three
Decided Jesus was born on December 25th
And raised then on the third day is a myth
Plus to deceive us
Commissioned Michelangelo to paint white pictures of Jesus
He used his aunt, uncle, and nephew
Subconsciously that affects you
It makes you put white people closer to God
(No! Man got game like a motherfucker)
True indeed, fuck it, Jihad
In the eight century Muslims conquered
Spain, Portugal and France and controlled it for 700 years
They never mention this in history class
'Cause ofays are threatened when you get the real lesson
Moors from Baghdad, Turkey threatened European Christians
Meaning, the white way of life; hence the Crusades for Christ
On November 25th, 1491
Santiago defeats the last Muslim stronghold, Granada
King Ferdinand gave thanks to God for victory
And the Pope of Rome and declared this date to forever be
A day of "Thanksgiving" for all European Christians

Now listen, when you celebrate "Thanksgiving"
What you are actually celebrating
Is the proclamation of the Pope of Rome
Who later, in league with Queen Isabella
Sent Cardinal Ximenos to Spain
To murder any blacks that resisted Christianity
These Moors, these black men and women were from Baghdad, Turkey
And today, you eat the turkey for your "Thanksgiving" day
As the European powers destroyed the Turkeys
Who were the forefathers of your mothers and fathers
Now fight the power, bitch-ass niggas

Now around this time, whites started callin' us Negroes
That's Spanish for "black object" meaning we're not really people
But property, and the triangle trade begins - they seize us
Queen Elizabeth sends the first slaves on a ship named Jesus
Stealin' land from the indigenous natives
Gave them alcohol to keep the Red Man intoxicated
Whites claim they had to civilize these pagan animals
But up until 1848 there's documented cases
Of whites being the savage cannibals, eating Indians
In 1992, it's Jeffery Dahmer
They slaughtered a whole race with guns
Drugs, priests and nuns
1763, the first demonic tactic of biological warfare
As tokens of peace, Sir Jeffery Amherst
Passed out clothing and blankets to the Indian community
Infested with small pox, knowing they had no immunity
Today it's AIDS, you best believe it's man made
'Cause ain't a damn thing changed, let me explain
Now since people of color are genetically dominant
And Caucasoids are genetically recessive
And whites expect to be predominant, meaning survive as a race then
They simply must take precautions
That's why they're worried about their future now
'Cause by 2050 almost all the Earth's population will be brown
Then black, so understandin' that, whites counter-react
(Man I'm saying, the fools ain't nothing but a teaspoon of milk in a world coloured with joy)
So they created a system
To force blacks into an unnatural position
That re-enforces the position of natural inferiority
In addition, created guns and developed the ethnocentric view
That God justifies every fuckin' thing they do
Condition people to perceive whites' culture as civilized
And every other culture considered primitive - not true
Racism is the system of racial subjugation against non-whites
In every areas of human relation
Entertainment, education, labor, politics
Law, religion, sex, war and economics
See blacks were 3/5ths of a man with tax purposes intended
You think you're Afro-American? You're a 14th amendment and a good nigga
Jews don't salute the fuckin' swastika
But niggas pledge allegiance to the flag that accosted ya
They never teach about the break of islands like Jamaica
But before slaves came here whites would take a
Pregnant woman, hang her from a tree by her toes
Slice her stomach with a knife and let the unborn baby fall to the flo'
And stomp an unborn child in front of all the slaves
To inbreed fear, so they'd be scared and behave
And not rebel more
Understand all whites must be perceived as potential predators
I paraphrase historian Ishakamusa Barashango
"Understand that, regardless of the lofty ideas engraved on paper in such documents as the Constitution or Declaration, the basic nature of the European American white man remains virtually unchanged"
So, check
This is the nature of the threat
