[Intro: Haile & Stefflon Don]
Yeah, in my zone, yeah, yeah
Seh she haffi do it 'til the mornin' come
Oh, you know we haffi do it 'til the mornin' come

[Verse 1: Stefflon Don]
He only messin' with the real don, cuz he rude too
If I ever got a problem, he got one too
Guns cock if the Don cry, everythin' die
No boy could never test I, that could never fly
So what you sayin' to me?
Uh, Will to the Jada
Elizabeth, he need me like the paper
I got a bad attitude and it stink
But he still loves me like alcoholic loves a drink
And he love my imperfections
Stretch marks any part in the section
Quick thoughts, no phones or reception
My baby keep me calm with affection

[Chorus: Haile]
Money neva buy my favourite girl
Sing out you are my favourite girl
Lookin' inna mi eye, my favourite girl
Go down, and nuh behave it
Sing out the song now, oh
What is this loving?
Only Jah know
Sing out you are my favourite girl
Look inna mi eye my girl
Say she haffi do it 'til the mornin' come
Bruk, bruk, bruk, bruk, bruk
Get love in di phone 'til the callin' done
Bruk, bruk, bruk, bruk, bruk

[Verse 2: Stefflon Don]
(Don, uh)
[?], heard I'm next up, yeah, I'm on draft
Labels stop when I ring 'cause I'm hot prob'
Puttin' rocks where my vest up, call that chest love
Foreign rocks like it's hopscotch and I won't stop
I dismiss all you chicks
Spit from the E 5th and I'm proud
Here's to BIG PON
Diamonds lookin' like my albino friend
Stick with, repossession tick when they hear the click, click
Pussy drippin' like a broken tap, drip, drip
Boss up, pon my fat back, make it clap
Belly fat, pussy poppin' from the fat

[Chorus: Haile & Stefflon Don]
Why I never whine my favourite girl
Sing out you are my favourite girl
Lookin' inna mi eye, my favourite girl
Go down, and nuh behave it
Sing out the song now, oh
What is this loving?
Only Jah know
Sing out you are my favourite girl
Look inna mi eye my girl
'Cause you know we haffi do it 'til the mornin' come (bruk it dung)
Work, work, work, work, work
Give me good lovin' so mi nah gi yuh bun (bruk it dung)
Work, work, work, work, work

[Bridge: Stefflon Don]
Yeah, babe, you know mi nah gon' lie
Me neva beg a guy, hopin' I don't lie
You don't see mi with no other guy
Baby, you set the temperature high
Lovin' what you do, what you do to me
Give me good love, I don't need money
Love the way you whine up on my body
Love the way you whine up on my body
Mmm, mmm
Mmm, mmm

[Chorus: Haile]
Money never buy my favourite girl
Sing out you are my favourite girl
Lookin' a mi eye my favourite girl
Go down, and nuh behave  it
Sing out the song now, oh
What is this loving?
Only Jah know
Sing out you are my favourite girl
Look inna mi eye my girl
Say she haffi do it 'til the mornin' come
Bruk, bruk, bruk, bruk, bruk
Get love in di phone 'til the callin' done
Bruk, bruk, bruk, bruk, bruk
Say she haffi do it 'til the mornin' come
Work, work, work, work, work
Get love in di phone 'til the callin' done
Bruk, bruk, bruk, bruk
