[Intro]
She's 'bout that life. She's 'bout that life. Too much of a good thing. Too much of a good thing. Too much of a good thing. Yo

[Hook - Larina]
She's 'bout that life she twerks her body
She likes to be life of the party
So we keep coming back with more and more gifts
She likes to flirt, stay out and party
So I say, "Cool, don't hurt nobody."
But she keep coming back with more and more chips

[Verse 1]
Boy meets girl
Girl likes boy on girl on girl
And it's our world
She be bringing dimes home, this our swirl
Having fun since we was younger
Competing, who can get the most numbers
Them other girls don't come between us
Unless we make her cum in-between us
She say I keep her satisfied
Bad bitch and she fucking with a badder guy
But then she started doing her excluding me
Walked in the bedroom like "Who is she?"
Life with an exotic dancer
Arguing like Sway and Kanye, you ain't got the answers
Can't commit and I hate the shit
How do you close an open relationship?

[Hook]
She's 'bout that life she twerks her body
She likes to be life of the party
So we keep coming back with more and more gifts
She likes to flirt, stay out and party
So I say, "Cool, don't hurt nobody."
But she keep coming back with more and more chips


[Verse 2]
A leopard can't change his spots
Could I ever be faithful when you forever not?
Cross your heart and hope to die
You say it ain't cheating cause I know you bi
See at first we was having fun
But now you having too much and I'm not having none
Why do I get upset?
Coming home with fucking hickys on your neck
Lipstick on your dress
I'm sure she was hot, but I don't wanna hear the rest
They say sharing is caring
So start caring, share Emily and Sharon
Double standard, some other girl
And you don't want me with no other girl
Unless you there too
But that ain't fair boo

[Hook]
She's 'bout that life she twerks her body
She likes to be life of the party
So we keep coming back with more and more gifts
She likes to flirt, stay out and party
So I say, "Cool, don't hurt nobody."
But she keep coming back with more and more chips


Too much of good thing {x6}
