[Intro: Barack Obama]
To make the killing or capture of Bin Laden
The top priority of our war against Al-Qaeda
Even as we continued our broader efforts to
Disrupt, dismantle and defeat his network

[Hook]
We in the streets like Al Qaeda
In the black on black ??
I be on 28s screaming nigga take that
It's the getaway driver
While we blasting out the back
Military isn't jack
Hello Iraq

[Verse 1: Ras Kass]
You would make a sexy corpse
I should resurrect Jeffrey Dahmer
So he could suck your lifeless ??
Damnation in a verse by any means
???
Queensbridge projects
???
Sipping codeine
38% unemployment, living off chili beans
Little niggas with neck tats and skinny jeans
No role model, daddy split like Billy Jean
Looking for a winning team, ??
Gangs go to war retaliate on their enemies
Some join the armed forces to get that military issue
Ain't no coming back when that M16 hit you
We in the sands of America
??, ain't nowhere we own
Nigga be strong, or be gone
??? revolution ???
We the next hood dictator
CIA collect data
Now that Bin Laden dead, can we get our civil liberties back
That George Bush stole with the Patriot Act
My homie facing terrorist threats
Tell this bitch she getting slapped
8am in the ghetto
Hello Iraq

[Hook]

[Outro: Barack Obama]
I met repeatedly with my national security team
As we developed more information about the possibility that we had located Bid Laden
Hiding within a compound deep inside Pakistan
After a firefight they killed Osama Bin Laden and took custody of his body
