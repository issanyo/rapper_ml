[Intro]
Stupid rapper, you just won a Biillion dollars.  What are you gonna do?
I'm a buy a fucking car and a chain

[Verse 1: Ras Kass]
A nation is free
I mean it's built to create poverty
Designed to give us poor education so no jobs for me
And that's the hypocrisy
Playing cops and robbery
Made us felons for selling weed then opened up the pharmacy
Auntie play the Lottery but the ghetto rich with artistry
It's what the future George Washington Carvers be
The freshest barbers be Dominicans and 'Ricans
Latin niggas so hood, they ain't even Spanish speaking
So rep your home team, Dodgers, Braves
Yankees, Astros and Golden State
Lions, Red Sox, the place you swerve
Up Seattle, fuck Redskins, that's a racial slur
The hood full of Games but ain't no amusement park
You get abused when dark so we dress to confuse the Narcs
No enjoyment old ladies stand in long ass line just to collect their unemployment for the DMV and the DMV
Take 9 hours, 11 minutes for the EMT
'Cause the ghetto is just like the Capitol
Big White House surrounded by nothing but broke blacks, ya know?
Yeah, this nation a plantation by definition
Christian, but don't drink the water in Flint, Michigan
Free admission, a lot of dead-end routes
It's easy to get in but it's hard to get out
I love the lessons it gave me the hood made me
Keep the mentality too long the hood would drive you crazy

[Hook: Ras Kass]
You know where I'm going, take me to NigsneyLand
I'm going to NigsneyLand, I'm going to NigsneyLand
I know my white people understand
But get for real, don't say it
I'm going to NigsneyLand, I'm going to NigsneyLand
I know my white people understand
But get for real, don't say it

[Verse 2: Ras Kass]
For entertainment we hop on rides
Ho's hop inside whips the hot guys drive
On the roller coaster with d-boys and strippers
Fire works pop light up the night from pistolers and hit niggas
Six Flags, Bloods and Crips niggas
Surenos, Latin kings who don't admit niggas
Vice Lords and G.D.'s with literature
So stick to the script, nigga
Somebody snitch, then the pigs convict niggas
So rep your home team, the Steelers, Clippers
Da Bulls, Padres, Suns, 76ers
The Heat, big Wings, watching the Saints vs. Patriots while Brady Deflate-Gate
Heard the haters gon' hate is that what they meant
When they gentrified the hood by steady raising the rent
Cop stops a single mother for a bullshit ticket
Paid minimum wage, can't afford it, too expensive
Working part-time raising kids court is relentless
Judge added five hundred dollar late fee licence suspended
Now how to get to work on time, baby to the sitter?
She had to risk it, pulled over for the warrant and convicted
Car impounded 30 days, lost her job
She on the bus to get on food stamps now, the cycle's vicious
And that's a carousel, remember it's free admission
Designed to create self-hate and drug addiction
But the strong survive and sometimes the bad guys win
I'm a keep it 10 times 10
Dressed for success, I guess
But it's kinda hard to ball on Metro PCS

[Hook: Ras Kass]
I'm going to NigsneyLand, I'm going to NigsneyLand
I know my white people understand
But get for real, don't say it
I'm going to NigsneyLand, I was born NigsneyLand
I know my white people understand
But get for real, don't say it
