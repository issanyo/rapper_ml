[Hook]
"Soul on ice"

[Verse 1]
I was told two wrongs don't make a right but three rights make a left
Act your age not your color, but I'd rather act darker
Mark a page with mazes of labyrinth
Fuck up a rhyme so bad I leave the microphone abstinent
To MC or not to MC?
Beyond B.E.T. and MTV exists me
Origin cause God created man and man created hip hop
I declined to participate until I was orientated
I heard 50,000 drivebys and 49,999 was lies
No surprise, as the sun rises, thine eyes have seen the light
But we stalk the night, I expose like an overbite
In limbo I lamp, rape the lady kill the tramp
The wrong action for the right motive, so now
Give me 50,000 black angry role models
Take me to DC I'll throw the first fuckin' bottle
Cause I don't give a fuck about a menial existence
And I don't give a fuck about nonviolent resistance
Civil rights will not suffice
In the name of Jesus Christ they got my soul on ice

[Verse 2]
Walkin' on skulls cause I'm two steps ahead so I started at square three
Now I'm Cubed like O'Shea Jackson be
Subzero catching fatalities to my spirituality
Smoke like a chimney, drink like a Kennedy
Still no remedy
Fuck shooting a fair one
Cause open cuts from fuckin' some nigga up
Can lead to contracting HIV positivity
You never know who got traits of femininity
What agwan, pussy wool blood clot
And deal with the bullshit batty-boy business fi' dat
You play the villain
There will be another soundboy killin'
Benadryl pumps through my adrenaline
Feelin' my raps weight, I track Heavy like Tony Dofat
Hip hop is 2% milk but mostly no fat
And most MCs ain't prepared
So what I say goes over your head like pubic hair
In 1999 (flip the script) triple six
One world government "Novus Ordo Seclorum"
Check your dead president, represented on the one dollar bill
And if Clinton was the answer it was a stupid question
My soul's on ice, baby
