[Intro: Ras Kass]
No woman love me like the Hennessey
It's all about the 'yac
It's all about, uh, the 600s, property (Big thangs, nigga!)
Take care of your kids, your momma
The pussy you went up in, and the pussy you came out of
Are the most important ones!
It's all I'm saying
Aside from that, yo niggas, it's all or nuthin'

[Verse 1: Twista]
All or nothin', fuck all the bluffin', won't let the po-po arrest me;
Try to hit the deck to bless me
But I'm still broke so I ride like Frank & Jesse
But they can't catch me. Breakin' niggas off like a sawed-off
Comin' for the fetty, man; my millimeter bringin' better things
When I pull, like a better bang, so if I have to, I'mma let it rang
Gotta handle my functions, but an outcome, I have a somethin
Instead of nothin', haters hold me down
And servin' thru a stickup or somethin'
Now I gotta pick up the pump and let it ride
All or nuthin, step aside, or you can hit the paper big time;
You gon' murder like strychnine, wit' a grip nine, sever bitch time
Cuz I gotta mine, and it's on

[Verse 2: Ras Kass]
You comin' up short like a million midgets masturbatin';
Masqueradin' as the most murderous madman militia
My nigga Twista told me
Monopolize, strategize, maximize, make money to win
With career sinners enter center
Turn ya whole placenta magenta, quintessential inventor
Please, we C's and B's, VL's and GD's;
Got OG's, OZ's, keys for these millionaire mo-neys
Release your shells, my nigga;
Knew the job was dangerous, when I took it, why's a player
From Keyser Soze y'all how to walk crooked, look it
Got a sophisticated ho mob
With assassin bitches that give my shotgun barrel blow jobs
So when the four stickin out like a sore toe thong
It's no prob, vocally for sure squad, thorough man

[Hook: Twista]
Gotta get that cash, gotta get that dough
Stacks that you can't float
Kick in the door, we on the floor, come up off a G and 2 hundred mo'
Gotta get that cash, gotta get that dough
Shit, all or nothin', no bluffin', if I have to, I'm bustin'
Gotta get that cash, gotta get that dough
Stacks that you can't float
Kick in the door, we on the floor, come up off a G and 2 hundred mo'
Gotta get that cash, gotta get that dough
Shit, all or nothin', no bluffin', if I have to, I'm bustin'

[Verse 3: Twista]
Nigga worthless to bones, like nickels to quarters
Fallers to shot callers, all of gotta get the paper somehow
For the school of the gun style, see me til the cops call us
Hell brought us, to a situation where we gotta driveby
Let the bullets from my nine fly, to murder who you was deprived by
But I admit sometimes if it wasn't for crime I'd
Probably be broke and homeless while the start keep it low goin, homeless
So I'm hookin up wit Ras Kass, on some shit we can stack cash
But if I have to pull back a rag fast, on that ass nigga

[Verse 4: Ras Kass]
These savage streets full wit jackas, racists, crackers and cannibals
So it's understandable, why I'm half man, half animal
Ridin' through the hood on my elephant like Hannibal
See, I used to have dreams of fuckin' an R&B bitch
And I used to dreams of bein' 21 and rich
One outta two ain't bad, though, now I'm tryin' to be rich by age 25
Inshallah, I'll survive that new world abchao
But you don't hear me

[Hook: Twista]
Gotta get that cash, gotta get that dough
Stacks that you can't float
Kick in the door, we on the floor, come up off a G and 2 hundred mo'
Gotta get that cash, gotta get that dough
Shit, all or nothin', no bluffin', if I have to, I'm bustin'
Gotta get that cash, gotta get that dough
Stacks that you can't float
Kick in the door, we on the floor, come up off a G and 2 hundred mo'
Gotta get that cash, gotta get that dough
Shit, all or nothin', no bluffin', if I have to, I'm bustin'

[Verse 5: Ras Kass]
Homeboy, my game's tight:
I could talk the Virgin Mary out her panties the same night
From a cocoon on the dark side of the moon
The illest nigga existin', I know who you are:
FUBAR, fucked up beyond all recognition
In the middle of the ghetto I'm buildin' a casino
Like Bugsy Siegel illegal employ niggas and Latinos
Shootout wit the ATF and FEMA, to free C-BO, see dough
They got me  like Steven Biko, cept I  pack vente cinqo
Rowdy Los Angeleno, you got knocked the fuck out like Deebo

[Hook: Twista]
Gotta get that cash, gotta get that dough
Stacks that you can't float
Kick in the door, we on the floor, come up off a G and 2 hundred mo'
Gotta get that cash, gotta get that dough
Shit, all or nothin', no bluffin', if I have to, I'm bustin'
Gotta get that cash, gotta get that dough
Stacks that you can't float
Kick in the door, we on the floor, come up off a G and 2 hundred mo'
Gotta get that cash, gotta get that dough
Shit, all or nothin', no bluffin', if I have to, I'm bustin'
