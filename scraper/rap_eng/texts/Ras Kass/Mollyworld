(Bridge) x2
What the fuck did you put in that cup
Molly fool , you better buckle up
I heard that shit's a hell of a drug
Too late now ,you better buckle up
Hold you wet and wanna let you fuck
Mollywood ,you better buckle up
Speeding now I just can't slow up
Mollywood ,you better buckle up

(Hook)
Fame, it's even more addictive than cocaine
Releases the same dopamines that's in your brain
Lose touch with reality delusions they no sane
But all you wanna do is be a star so let's go mane

(Verse)
Rock you to sleep like muslim stoning thief
Adultery is bare in flesh you belong in the sheet
Wrapped up sleep in the coroner's office
Meanwhile I'm eating taco bell the riddle shelf smell look like nachos
Fire sauce, 'bout to set the riot off
This the crusades, I'm king Richard the Lionheart
My homies at the bake and soda but they buy us off
And it's the game changer I can make a lion bark
I spit a remarkable arsenal that's the often flow
A narcissist markable artist who get the profit though
Roll out the carpet , I walk it from there it's all a bling
I'm on the good with my nigga this bitch despite the drinks

They say fame, it's even more addictive than cocaine
Releases the same dopamines that's in your brain
Lose touch with reality delusions they no sane
But all you wanna do is be a star so let's go mane

(Verse)
Faster , better , speeding, burning
Staking niggers like an appendix
Don't need it, pull it
Knock on squize it, the trigger , then please don't pull it
Couldn't make that person come back busting probably shouldn't ye
I'm flying stealth under the radar, filla
I'm too legit to quit drinking carlo and rasie, bila
Mila Kunis I want you bitch screaming hold down Jesus
Kill the lorax now we smoking all your trees up
Chiba, get my fees up , lead the cheese in tortillas
Like the piece of cake sadilla ,select a damn ninja
Walk the post coital , and can't remember who this whore is
I can't pay my rent rent but I'm fucking gorgis
