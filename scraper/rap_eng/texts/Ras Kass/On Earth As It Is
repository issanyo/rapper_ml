[Intro]
Hallelujah when I do ya

[Verse 1]
Shit, I ain't never seen an angel, virgin bitches with halos
But my secular metaphysical theology is fatal
'cause me with a mic cable is a religious experience in itself
I got a message from God
He said, "Don't even try to fuck with me," suckers reluctantly
Carried the cross and uppercuts in Nazareth, I'm hazardous
I speak to the heads and raise the dead like Lazarus
Led the fucking lambs to the slaughter and walked on water
When it's frozen, in a crown of thorns I'm on point
Like the unicorn and Cuneiform
To bring rains to deserts; storm for 40 days and 39 nights
So my cerebral flows flood the Earth with uh, megahertz
And the first shall be last and the last shall be first
Reciting a biblical verse before I make your melon burst
Like that nigga Jules from Pulp Fiction
My salvation is salivation, and diction, crucifixion
It's a blessing just to live another day they say
'cause the Lord giveth and the Lord taketh away
So my niggas pray five times a day and still
Carry a trey-five-seven (On Earth, As It Is In Heaven)

[Hook]
(On the planet) Earth, it was my place of birth
Born to be the sole controller, of the universe
Drink liquor with the Lord and shoot dice with Christ
Hitting seven, On Earth, As It Is In Heaven

[Verse 2]
Feeling like a prophet, cause I be talking to a burning bush
But I'm not knowin' till I fornicated with the ho and
Caught the clap so, my first communion consists of
Bread and wine and Doxycycline one-hundred milligram capsules (Amen)
Let the commandments begin again
Cause just like Moses on Mount Sinai, I broke all ten
Call it even if Eve sinned in Eden when I covet my neighbor's wife
I do dirt and good works to breathe life into mics
And give us this day to make our daily bread
Cause if I'm broke I'm serving cavi in Bethlehem
Or selling my soul to Satan, six figure record deal temptations
My religious denominations be C-notes
I be the coming like when Mary's water broke
So let there be light, so niggas can see I rock mics religiously
Those who believe, ye shall receive
But non-believers, you niggas doubt my existence like agnostics
The hostile gospel, I apostle, each epistle from speaking in tongues
For God so loved the world he gave his only begotten son
To set it on niggas, blowing backwards bastards to Kingdom Come
And knowin the Judas in my crew
So do unto others before they do unto you (that's right)
Like Rastas heads be dreadin'
Phonetic armageddeon (On Earth, As It Is In Heaven)

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
I hit the planet like a plague
The Book of Revelations' red dragon with ten horns and seven heads
And seven crowns skills concealed until the Seventh Seal's revealed
To fulfill prophecy
From B.C. to AC/DC radio receivers
The messiah comes back in nineteen nina fever and the rap world ends
The hereafter is after
You hear the HemisFear trinity raps rapture your Babylon vinyl
And thou shalt not worship false idols
Just like David guillotined Philistines, even God is homicidal
Fucking these kids like Catholic priests after mass
Pubic hair of lamb's wool, and feet of burned brass
That I can put up in your platinum ass, son
Spare the rod and spoil the child, every knee shall bow
When the divine styler is speaking in parables
Like old baptist churches, I'm getting old bitches hysterical
HALLELUJAH! Praise be to my medula oblongota
Not another nigga hotter, believe that Meshach
Your hip-hop martyr who sacrificed and gave my life
But got 4Pac, so I'm livin the Thug Life in the afterlife
Then I be walking through the pearly gates
With an infared scope ten millimeter heater (Why?)
Cuz if my name ain't in the Book of Life I'm snuffing St. Peter (Do it)
Drinking the blood of Jesus Christ and pissing holy water
No question who can come cleaner
M-P-C plus M-I-C equals holy B-I-B-L-E to me
Matrimony is getting head but I refuse to break bread
With Jezebels, my management already gets twenty percent
So fuck tithing, go to Hell
I'd rather continue backsliding
You're not from the tribe of Judah, so why you lying?
From Watts to Zion, I'm signifying
The next shit to wreck shit and see the Exodus
Amen

[Hook]
