[Intro: Ras Kass]
Once again, we tango for cash
Ras Kass, Dr. Dre and Mack 10 connected
We ghetto fabulous baby
The best food, drink and pussy that money can buy

[Verse 1: Ras Kass]
Every day of my life is off the ringer
That's guaranteed, like a fistfight on Jerry Springer
I got the hottest flow to hit the street since lava
So holla, we all hustle for dollar dollars
From Sac to Houston, New Orleans to D.C
We drinkin' V-S-O-P the beats beep
Bangin, catch me with a dimepiece next to me
My body all over your body like LSG
Neighborhood celeb with the keys to my city like the mayor
Rookies askin us how to be a playa
Get in where you fit in, and never get your ghetto pass revoked
No matter how much money you make
Stay true to the game loc, guest list terror clothes
In jeans and tennis shoes, breakin your strict dress codes
Spit lyrical bricks, thirteen g
So I can be richer than Master P sellin 'Ghetto D'

[Hook: Mack 10]
We Ghetto, fabulous
Money make the world go round so let's handle this
Ghetto, fabulous
Broadcastin live from Los Angeles
We ghetto, fabulous
Money make the world go round so let's handle this
Ghetto, fabulous
Broadcastin live from Los Angeles

[Verse 2: Dr. Dre]
You ain't heard of me, you ain't listenin hard enough
Started in Compton servin from a ice cream truck
Now ten years later whippin a custom Navigator
Steppin on your toes playa, stuffin up your alligators
I'm ghetto, like Newport cigarettes, feel me
Boom bap and slap that ass silly
This is for the full time students slash part time strippers
And young niggas, clockin at least five figures
Some of us pro atheletes, some of us rap over fat beats
Some of us hustle in the streets
Twenty deep in Club Nikki's so you know we gots to mingle
Trickin' off a pocket full of singles, huh
And it's all bueno, musical mafia like Frank Sinatra
Pop a thirteen shot Glock to make you Go See the Doctor
Ain't nuttin nice
From hood to hood, love livin the lavish life

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Ras Kass]
Nigga Stu-B-Doo in the GS300 playing number two Tekken
Zero to sixty in six point seven seconds
*tires screech* hanging out the window acting up
Chickenheads like "You doin fo'(4) much!"
Flexin the Rolex oyster perpetual, thirty-five diamonds
Across the face, still eatin out foam cups and paper plates
We don't call it playa hatin in the nine-eight
It's P.I, that's pass intereference, automatic first down
Want Juice like 2Pac, then Obey Your Thirst clown
Be in the PJ's in NY, rockin DK
Mix EJ with OJ, OK, we say
"L.A. niggas got crazy game
Like John Elway got a superbowl ring"
The homies down for whatever, we stack the chedda
Swiss bank accounts, and mo' mozzarella fella

[Hook]

[Outro]
Ugh! And it don't stop!
HAHA, WESTSIDE RIDERS BABY, HAHA!
