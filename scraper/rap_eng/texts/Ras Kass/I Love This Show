[Hook]
First comes the family , animation comedy
Then reality kicks in, that's when the drama beat
Queue in suspense, will he live? will he DIE
Romance, thriller , obligatory sex scene
Life's a documentary, action signed by comicon for the trekkies
Next scene aura, word to the Koran
Everybody die like Sodom and Gomorrah

[Verse 1: Ras Kass]
Ye, and I love this show
I love it when you can't love yourself, I don't love this dough
Y'all niggers fucking muppets I can come and go
Universal remote, I will turn this show
Abel catching Cain with the thing I will serve this road
Righteous sides, pick at your funeral service though
You wanna be a baller, updates turn this stone
The professional , protecting young cole to the death and more
Progressive with the flow , but I ain't selling car insurance though
Just a preview to let you know
That I am the watcher , prometheus invoker block buster
The homies win the streets with a chopper
Money shop but this not porn
Act the mac 8 and your bitch hand up in my popcorn
More testosterone, it rams we can lock on
Convertible your skull cap, leave a nigga top torn
Craving out of me be peeping the screen play
Label ride PD's who we pimpin' the DJ
So radio tell 'em exactly what he play
With all of this respect, don't give a fuck about what he say
Most rappers is actors, I'm just being honest
The door ain't never locked on just come up out the closet
Harlem sperm and just came in your deposit
Assholes solution just shot it without the artist
I did the knowledge, I could easily predict
Exactly what's gonna happen already with the script
Attack to their show
I Sarah Jean Underwood, spectacular rack
Ethics to the credits my miraculous blow
The only thing's missing is my black and them placs
Petite arson on the map, no patch works off my back
So I support it the substance 95 that's a fact
Huh, ye warrup my guy, poor people die
And trust me Fox News goin' live
In 20 years the government gonna tax off for breathing
Reality's uneven it's like beefing with a vegan
I spill burp the bars, look it's film the tracks
Mercedes black baby bout DeNiro with a bat
So don't turn your back my friend
The prequel and the sequel I be back again

[Hook]

Life's a movie and I love this show (x4)
