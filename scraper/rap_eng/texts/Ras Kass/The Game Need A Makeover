[Intro]
California be like that sometimes
You can see the palm trees
All on Venice beach
You see the bright lights on on Hollywood
You think its all good right
You getting dressed, you ready to go out
You see some bad bitches
That same bad bitch will set you the fuck up
You walking out the club from having a good time
Like you ain't tipsy
Before you know it you got a bag on your head
And you in the back of a van
Going somewhere you ain't never been in your life
That's the reason that you caught the fuck up right now
You don't understand, this shit about (?)
Next time you come out here
Maybe you should just stop a motherfucker
And ask

[Verse: Ras Kass]
My life consists of unsurpassed writing, flowing
Future CEO and (?) ultimate fighter
And millionaire matchmaker
Studio rat, make a pilgrimage to the booth
With a cute exotic girl
With a bottle of something 80 proof
(?) and she just bringing me food
But for some reason I keep giving her attitude
And I wonder why they even put up with a nigga
So let's get it construed
If you a little confused I'm an intricate dude
Lot of these niggas is bitches
Shouldn't be getting dick with a mule
Somewhere in a TJ donkey show
Man evolved from primates
Still see a lot of monkeys though
Yo
Monkey see, monkey do
Monkey get a wrench
And try to fuck it up for you
Bro
So
I spit it how I see it
Got a frog in your throat?
You can croak like Aaliyah
Rock the boat but in the end we all leave her
The Earth
Meaning try to make it real spit through a speaker
210 West
And I crawled off the 134
Arguing with some dirty whore
I met in Notrh Hollywood a little earlier before
Reminded me to catch up with my nigga Symptom
Ya heard
And I know my bars like pyrotecnnics
And that's why Piru's and Crips respect it
Even in hip-hop who ya'll claim is dope
Ain't the dopest, motherfucker must have slain the goat
Sold his soul to the devil to remain (?)
Cause if you ask them about Ras, that's all she wrote
Nigga
