"The streets was my playground
Tears, tears was my toy
People don't you see
The po' man's son is me"

[Hook]
Fuck a black republican, our people is struggling
Look homie it's easy to see
Fuck Fox News and fuck Ted Cruz
Shit in the Kool-Aid, pee in the Tea
Fuck every conservative, y'all devils are murderous
Look homie it's easy to see
Fuck southern plantations, trying to slave the whole nation
And that's why I pee in the Tea

[Verse 1]
I'm mixing Arnold Palmer with karma
I'm not a fan of Obama
I'm George Washington Carver, basic overall scholar
Y'all making peanuts and y'all don't know your own dollar
Squalor, the working poor can't survive
Wal-Mart workers in Ohio had to do food drives
For they own employees
Not even in the ballpark
When Wal-Mart workers can't afford to shop at Wal-Mart
So y'all thought the black dude was the savior
He just stole our privacy and paid all the haters (Wallstreet!)
Droned motherfuckers five times more than Bush
Never closed Guantanamo, come here nigga look
Crook, then managed to make racism overt
He Kenyan, Trump wanted his certificate of birth
Congress cut Welfare
And six million, stupid angry white racists on Welfare
Screamed "Hell yeah"
Tubby
Blinded by they hatred
So they don't want Obamacare cause sales rocket everywhere
Armageddon for Evangelicals is, when niggas get a good job
Good God

[Verse 2]
All minorities unite
They hate women's rights
Blacks and latinos on sight
Gays, but they killing poor whites too
Thinking they more like you? (NO)
The richest 1% stealing your slice too
Divide and conquer
Till you blame the Mexicans
But Wall Street hire senators from Texas and
Created this recession
Stole all our investments and never got arrested when
Homes foreclosed
They ejected residents
Pepper sprayed innocent
Occupy protesters while CEO's give themselves 20 mil bonuses
Potus did
Taxpayers bailed the U.S. out the excrement
Fuck
Billion bucks, what it cost to run for president
The Koch Brothers, Murdock bought your presidents
Special interests runs America, not your president
There is nothing supreme about the Supreme Court
Ain't nothing just about Scalia or Clarence Thomas
Uncle Tom nigga pledge allegiance to demonics
When Chief Just. Robertson run rule and demolished
Everything that Dr. King and Civil Rights accomplished
On the wrong side of history
No democracy
Not equal when corporations are people
Got me at the NRC in a neat V
Dockers unzipped with my dick in the sweet Tea
