[Intro: Ras Kass]
Yeah, O.D.B
Marlon Brando from the Sporty Thieves
Salute... Markis Precise... let's get it
Oh... oh... oh...

[Verse 1: Ras Kass]
Rassy never spit a wack bar, let alone a wack verse
Shrimp versus shark, nigga guess who get attacked first
My jeans conceal the girth of my bratwurst
My Jean Grae conceal the gat, her name's black purse
I eat your favorite rapper for a snack
Excuse me, no table manners in fact worse
Pack hertz like whack nerds
Car stereo louder than black church
Turnt up sound, won't turn down
Fuck Zimmerman, fuck Duck, fuck Stand Your Grand
And fuck Florida juries, only God can judge
Walk with legs over my head, homie I'm the grudge
Fake verse the real
Graffitied on my living room wall just to build
Reminder of universal law
Like real men don't drink from a straw, the stance is southpaw

[Hook: Ras Kass]
Name my pinky finger Dilla, ring finger Biggie
My middle finger 2Pac, fuck the world quickly
My index finger Big L, my thumb Big Pun
So when I make a fist to write a rhyme, it gets done
It's 5 fingers of death
It's 5 fingers of fresh
Salute my fallen comrades, it don't stop
May real music live on, it's real hip hop

[Verse 2: Ras Kass]
E-S-R-E-V-E-R, engineering
I rose from the grave, started hearing
The newest rap songs but they kept disappearing
Calendar went backwards, grown men turned to cheering
2000 to the 90s, 80s to the 70s
Kool Herc and Afrika Bambaataa, the Bronx apparently the genesis
Rassy hit the scene in '93, left niggas heads sticking up like stymie
Why me, cause I'm student of the art form
Fan first, lyrics buttery like the popcorn
And I stay on my street shit, I'm special like dark bitches with pink nips
Fuck your Bugatti, let's battle for the pink slip
Walk down in '95 fucking bitches at the freaknic
Dung beetles, most these niggas eat shit
After I just spit it, left hand no gimmicks

[Hook: Ras Kass]
Name my pinky finger Dilla, ring finger Biggie
My middle finger 2Pac, fuck the world quickly
My index finger Big L, my thumb Big Pun
So when I make a fist to write a rhyme, it gets done
It's 5 fingers of death
It's 5 fingers of fresh
Salute my fallen comrades, it don't stop
May real music live on, it's real hip hop

Name my pinky finger Dilla, ring finger Biggie
My middle finger 2Pac, fuck the world quickly
My index finger Big L, my thumb Big Pun
So when I make a fist to write a rhyme, it gets done
It's 5 fingers of death
It's 5 fingers of fresh
Salute my fallen comrades, it don't stop
May real music live on, it's real hip hop

[Post-Hook: Scratching]
The R-A-S
Microphone fiend
Can't nobody stop me
The waterproof emcee
Real, I'm only being real
The R-A-S
Now welcome to the terrordome
Remember the name, Ras Kass
I just stay hip-hop

[Hook: Ras Kass]
Name my pinky finger Dilla, ring finger Biggie
My middle finger 2Pac, fuck the world quickly
My index finger Big L, my thumb Big Pun
So when I make a fist to write a rhyme, it gets done
It's 5 fingers of death
It's 5 fingers of fresh
Salute my fallen comrades, it don't stop
May real music live on, it's real hip hop

[Outro]
Yeah, R.I.P. Heavy D, Eazy-E, Pimp C
Jam Master Jay, MCA, Mac Dre
