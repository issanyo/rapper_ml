[Verse 1: Ras Kass]
I’m sharp as a Puerto Rican’s line up
The bitches come, stay focused, get your grind up
I refuse to dumb it down, get your mind up
Fuck what you heard, like ears had vaginas
Coochie dog tags all shined up
I rhyme nastier than homeless people fucking
EFN production, catch me on Collins with a Cubana
Tan cassavas like it’s nothing
Yeah, today was a good day
More niggas in the pump than a hood day
And I get these hoes moist like good yay
My music hot, bitch just push play
Tell haters hashtag DMY
Go fuck yourself, eat shit and die
Call him LeBron for a reason
I shit a steamer on their chest then I’m leaving for Cleveland

[Hook: Rone Jeremy]
Everything we got in this world, nigga we earned it
Never follow your rules, took a lighter and burned it
Underground, nah we right here on the surface
Our rap sheet is perfect, we rap for a purpose
Everything we got in this world, nigga we earned it
Never follow your rules, took a lighter and burned it
Underground, nah we right here on the surface
Our rap sheet is perfect, we rap for a purpose

[Verse 2: Black Milk]
It's the flow flow, never so so with the writtens
One take in a break like intermissions
In the middle of the map, bottom of the mat
And you still listen to a tape that’s banging out the system
Wishing for them flashing lights to be flashing
My way like cars down the highway
Had to be high just to be at ease
Most of these niggas dreams turned to memories
But my niggas was like hell nah
Don’t even know how to spell the world fail
Not even in our vocab, we was on the grind from
Sundown to sunshine, the whole nine
That was old times
At the time old timers didn’t understand what was playing out the speakers
Music rumbling the tweeters make haters turn believers
Ladies that couldn’t leave us
You know, out the back door
Fade to black, pull a disappearing act, gone
Didn’t mean to stay long, just checking if my mics on
Yo we on?

[Hook: Rone Jeremy]
Everything we got in this world, nigga we earned it
Never follow your rules, took a lighter and burned it
Underground, nah we right here on the surface
Our rap sheet is perfect, we rap for a purpose
Everything we got in this world, nigga we earned it
Never follow your rules, took a lighter and burned it
Underground, nah we right here on the surface
Our rap sheet is perfect, we rap for a purpose

[Verse 3: KB Imean]
I’m ready for work like Monday
Catch me in LA on sucker free Sundays
On the porch like Smokey and Q on Friday
It’s a work week, and these suckers just work weak
Get busted like a condom popped when the sperm leak
Can’t touch me, like I’m sick and they germ freaks
I should sanitize their mouth for the dirt they’re spitting out
I remove em like a spot and my nickname was shout

[Verse 4: Rone Jeremy]
All I do is think of the dudes who got murdered
From the center, from the cypher, from bangers, from freestylers
Either palm trees or green weed growing in sunny Cali
Catch me in that V8 with smoke round me
I’m from Cali to the seas and I don’t need no triggers
Don't rock jewelry or long chains cause that’s for ugly niggas
The wolf stay hunger so we tryna hit the buffet
We work for that meal like the sign from a bum say

[Verse 5: Famous]
Back at it again, back hand battle for spins
We ain’t compatible, better watch who you’re calling your friends
Line you up for the firing squad, even the odds
In the city of emeralds, only taking what’s ours
Eyes on the prize, these busters is Mark Jacobs
Feeling divine, these models is all aces
We ain’t playing your cards right, but we come from a crazy hood
So your shot look crazy like Bill Cartwright

[Hook: Rone Jeremy]
Everything we got in this world, nigga we earned it
Never follow your rules, took a lighter and burned it
Underground, nah we right here on the surface
Our rap sheet is perfect, we rap for a purpose
Everything we got in this world, nigga we earned it
Never follow your rules, took a lighter and burned it
Underground, nah we right here on the surface
Our rap sheet is perfect, we rap for a purpose

[Verse 6: Cory Gunz]
I ain’t with none of that
I ain’t never in the back where all the frontin' at
Militia the gang, CMB enterprise
Somebody pray for me cause it’s dinner time
Hide your wife and your kids, bitch I’m a home wrecker
Guard your chest, and get a vest full of chrome checker
Yessir, little Redman on his own method
Niggas suck and y’all like em, you’re dome neckers
Anyway I go out, I’ll be mobbing for dole
Mama lonely, in your hood, ask about me, they know me
Respect is given, if less delivered, respect is taken
More chops and drops than niggas record breaking
Tell a threat fake and nigga name a place, time
And Imma take seconds, nigga ain’t gone waste time
Love how you niggas doing tank time
Fucking rats house rats, snake spawn
