[Intro: Kurupt (Killah Priest)]
Headless Horsemen in the building
Killah (Maccabeez officials) nigga
Ras nigga, Bis nigga, it's Priest nigga, Horsemen nigga
("They spit like something else")
Maccabee (as the books get close and we move on)
It isn't human
I'm get you nigga (or the other) this how we do it

[Verse 1: Killah Priest]
I hide my face like the Elephant Man
Follow you, reach out of long black sleeves with skeleton hands
Touch rappers, watch them rot, their skin fall off
Boil in the pavement on a cold boardwalk
Then I laugh like the Joker while pissing on them
Then put on my hood wait on the next corner
The next victim look in his face with tears in my eyes
That crystallize and turn into stone before they fall from my dome
Like an avalanche, the way I spit sound like an African chant
The Priest run through MCs like I'm trampling ants
Peep the form, it's the Vatican stance
The Pope victor the first the flow spit with the curse
The sicker the verse the more bodies we stick in the dirt
Wait around I'ma pick you a hearse
I like the long black ones, drive around while spinning on two wheels
It's whatever you feel, blue steel
On black day, silver clouds when the mac spray
Turn rappers back into clay
My minds a museum filled with microphone exhibits
Of rhymes that I write that look like pictures

[Verse 2: Ras Kass]
Aiyo my technique is berserk
I predator y'all niggas, pull your fucking skin off like a t-shirt
Retort, no remorse
Donate aborted rappers to stem cell research
I spit a few bars and niggas is FUBAR
You wouldn't ride on me if you was driving two cars
Homey, the mind of Cesar Augustus
Rocking a Caesar, eating a Caesar salad in August
Plus I'm illustrious, I've been with the Moors
Born and raised in L.A. by Monster Cody
Slowly chose the dark side for ice cold 40s
Like Obi-Wan Kenobi with an iced-out rollie
And might fuck a white bitch, don't get it fucked up
Love black chicks but they don't like to suck nuts
So tell me what the hell am I supposed to do
It's like sipping sizzurp in Houston, I'm supposed to screw
Talk slimy like okra, TiVo shit backwards
Just to make Harpo out of Oprah
Rass spits sicker than most groups put together
Cause y'all put together, I put fool to leather
And walk over dead bodies like Rise of the Machines
Don't be surprised nigga, it's Idi Amin
Rappers get ate up like the number on Kobe's jersey
Goddammit, I pop the clergy

[Verse 3: Canibus]
Canibus, the only MC on Earth
That did geophysical research about the new rebirth
The Sun turn the Earth to rotisserie dirt
Listen before you start dissing me first, this will be worst
Twelve degree pole shift displace the ocean
They send space probes in, they come back broken
Armageddon omen, Planet X inbound and rapidly approaching
None of us are chosen
Field manual 2-0 dash 4-6
Your life's getting away, you better run for it
Population reduction, mass destruction
The reset button is coming and some of us love it
The return of Nibiru, we will prepare you
Stay away from the media, they will scare you
Rappers respect beef, tactics and technique
I'ma show you how the best compete, let's peep
My verse on the mic is surgical strike
Of herbal delight with no personal life
Live Saturday Night, sacrifice batter the mic
Jab to the left, jab to the right

[Verse 4: Kurupt]
I'm the scripture sculptor, volcanic
You ignoramus I'm the future
Volcanic vulture firebird
I fire words catch this cannon
All opponents poetry Leonus
Spartan you just can't sink me
Shots, Hell's Kitchen to Helsinki
Since I was born its all about Roman
Since the Roman wars I been Caesar
Master sieges, master of diseases
Throughout the Legions, temperatures beyond degrees
Terrifying like Saddam in legions
Ingenious fuck ya, I don't wanna have to bust ya open
But I think ya looking to closely
And I don't wanna have to bust ya eyes, fuck it, fuck ya eyes
Fuck ya mama, fuck the drama
Who needs it? Who like it? Who bleeds it?
Who think it? Who smoke it? Who drink it?
Motherfucker I'm a start shrinking
Each and everyone of you niggas, you just particles
You walk in and get read like articles
Shredding I'm a teach all y'all
How to start poetry beheading
I'm the Headless Horsemen nigga, read the prescription
Try it once instantaneous addiction
If you ever wanna see me
H-O-R-S-E-M-E-N, nigga
