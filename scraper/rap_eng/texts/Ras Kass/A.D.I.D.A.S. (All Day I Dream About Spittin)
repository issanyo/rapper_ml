[Verse 1: Ras Kass]
It was all a dream
I used to read the Source magazine
2Pac and Biggie Smalls drinking Hennesseys
You fiend to see Public Enemy number one with a bullet
Cap peeler turn niggas ?seasons? to mullets (like whoa!)
Like ninja assassins!
Make the floor creak, bottom of my feet got latches
All grown up; now I'm smashin' an Aston
The world turns about as fast as the cash spends
Avalanche, leave them gaspin' in Aspen
You a never was, I'd rather be a has-been
But I'm right now and this is right now
You're allergic to skill so put the mic down
My bitches take E pills, daze and vic- down
My shoe game's sick, shit looks like Niketown
I see through niggas just like a nightgown
You're about to witness the evolution of sight sound

[Hook]
ADIDAS - All day I dream about spittin
ADIDAS - The freestyle sounds like writtens
A.D.I.D.A.S - I'm so fresh
ADIDAS - All day I dream about spittin
ADIDAS - Put the mic down, dawg, you're bullshitting
A.D.I.D.A.S - I'm so fresh


[Verse 2: Ras Kass]
Sportin my suede PUMAs
Gore-Tex, K-Swiss, Diadora, Ellesse
British Knights
FILAs ma mia, Morris, Reeboks
Sergio Tacchini suedesuits
Remember back in the days
EK glasses, snakeskin on the frames
Don't hate on me man
I walk the street like its magic data grain
Once again, an unsigned hype
Hypochondriac, I'm sick all the time
What kind of style do y'all like?
I got that SARS, that swine flu
Spit bubonic, arthritis flow
Retire old cats like cush did to chronic
And my pistols demonic
So you can go to hell with an ass full of ?blue bonnets?
Yeah now they're finally dropping hot shit
Brittany Spears eating toys made in China - I'm toxic
Pick a bitch up holdin' my wood like chopsticks
While young niggas sold dope just to cop shit

[Hook]

This message is live and direct from the T dot
416 to the 954
Letting you know that your morning voice is very sexy
And I dig your thick smooth skin
