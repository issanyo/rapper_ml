[Verse 1: Ras Kass]

Catch me at the North Pole, living with the Inuits
Seal-skin hoody, hunting Saint Nich-o-las
European holidays and niggas so ignorant
Got Prancer and Blitzen’s heads mounted in my kitchen, bitch (funny!)
My Uncle family, Jehova’s witnesses
As kid’s we thought they was crazy for not celebratin’ shit
Went to college, learned Christmas is ridiculous
Pagan holidays, ain’t no Christ in it
Cause a holiday, means a ‘holy’ day
And December 25th was the birth of the God Saturn
Ancient Romans would celebrate
The upper class worshipped Mithra
The God of the uncontrollable Sun
And that’s Christmas
In the western hemisphere
December 22nd is the shortest day and longest night, of the year
Rains for 3 days, hence the Sun died
The Sun resurrects December 25
So the S-U-N, is the Sun of God
In man-made religion, metaphorical Son of God
Named him Amen-Rê, named him Saturn, named him Mithra, named him Christ, the same pattern
Ancient astrology, the Egyptians wrote this
Scientifically put, it’s the Winter Solstice
And after the Catholic Church came to power
They absorbed festivals already popular
In the slave days, they gave us as gifts, fuck!
Bound us in metal chains and they whipped us
Went to church and smiled, right after they lynched us
You still a fucking slave if you celebrate Christ-mas!

[Verse 2: Ras Kass]

Snow in Bethlehem is rare as fuck
Ain’t no evergreens and reindeer, y’all is nuts
The history of Christmas is a mix of customs from pagans
Y’all clowns just decoratin' Satan
The Yule tree was first decorated in the 16th century
In Livonia in Germany
In northern Europe, the Druids during winter nights
Kept evergreens as a symbol of everlasting life
Vikings in Scandinavia went a little farther
Thought of the special plant of the Sun, got bolder
The Germanic tribes worshipped ?? ?? white horse
Original Santa Clause, rode one of course
And the Dutch called him Sinterklaas
His sidekick ?? named her ??
Bad children killer dawg
Sinterklaas myth, combined with Saint Nick
A 4th century Greek bishop who gave gifts
Said he liberated an Ethiopian from a slave ship
Who was so grateful he became his servant
It’s so racist, the boy he called Peter
The origin of the elves is so fiendish
Black Peter in English, Zwarte Piet in Swedish
Why do you need this, look it up if you don’t believe it
And even to this day in the Netherlands
They still dress up in blackface, now go to bed again

[Verse 3: Ras Kass]

Listen
I respect fact over faith
The Catholic Church ?? its celebrations on pagan dates
Culturally, every European participates
Then after the pilgrims emigrate to the United States
All those European customs assimilate
Forcibly imposed on every other race
New York city was first colonized by the Dutch fam
It was called New Amsterdam
Now I see a lot of sinners in dementia
Worshipping 70ft trees in Rockefeller centre
Stupid if you ain’t Viking or a Druid
If you Christian and or black, you are fucking foolish
I’ve seen Miracle on 42nd Street, wasn’t no Asians or Latinos, you disrespected me
Mental genocide, it’s black lost
I’m just being real, this is fact from Jack Frost!

[Outro: Ras Kass]

We live in a country where 1% of the population controls 99% of the wealth. Where a black President kisses corporate American ass. Not one single criminal Wall Street banker spent the day in prison, but they’ll arrest 5,000 peaceful Occupy Wall Street protestors. We in the biggest recession since the Great Depression, but y’all throw your fucking money away, 5.3 billion on Black Friday
You not just a stupid consumer, that’s not capitalism, that’s a slave mentality
