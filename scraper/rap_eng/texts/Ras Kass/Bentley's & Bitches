Get chipped up, fresh out the gate - yea we strive for that
Homie wanted it bad enough so he died for that
I'mma follow my dreams like never before, knah'mean
They givin out time like trick-or-treat candy
And every day is Halloween
And that one time, ay Lo why the call it 'one time'
Cuz it only takes one time to get yo' ass behind
Them iron bars, I used to steal cars
Never wheel cars all around that D
Gleam gleamin on the scantlous hoes - beware of the cuthroats
Mad cuz kids be pointin to my mami that's bullet loc'ed
God told me "Go study the ants", I'mma work like 'em
Never pass emcees, give them dust like dirtbike 'em
And in the process of that, I progress with that
I know to get out here and get my scratch
Break the door down for my loved ones, you know who you are
And I'mma leave the bank open like ahhhhhh!

When I die bury me butt-naked and face down in the grass
So I can fuck the world while y'all kiss my ass
Like that faggot - crawlin out this bitch like a 6 foot maggot
For the lust of livin lavish
I rhyme in a cocoon so nobody can find me
And that rapper who dick you ridin, ten years behind me
Motivation switched from freestyle to buy me
Nigga gotta twist this paper like oragami

I'm in the business of Bentley's and bitches, and my chips
And I'm keepin four eyes on them schemers, when I dip
In the business of Bentley's and bitches, and my chips
And I'm keepin four eyes on them schemers, when I dip

In this cold-hearted world, nobody give a damn about you
When your on a mission to come up, they wanna knock it out ya
But as soon as you break the ice you gone see how they fake it
"That's my dawg right there, damn, I knew he was gone make it"
Ha yea right, I done heard it all, your full of yourself
When I needed your full support, where the hell was the help?
You was nowhere in sight, but I flooded the airways
You thinkin about plottin, huh, I'm thinkin about diggin ya grave
You wanna hurt me huh, wanna do it real bad huh?
Cuz I kick it with Cash Money, that's makin you mad huh?
But I worked to hard for this, you know the game gets stressful
But I know my biggest revenge is to keep being successful
You instigated, ya hater, who would have let you in?
Fool, just give me forty feet cuz you know what I'm doin

I spit from the genitals bitch, leave masculine stench
Got niggas panickin' petro, I'll make a mannequin flinch
Grew up botanical inch - the root of all evil
Green thumb for greenbacks, 'reign of the tech'
But we can't all eat though (Why?)
Cuz y'all fecal, we brawl lethal
Homicide victims off of Fairfax & Pico
Sugar, nobody's ever Equal
Cuz the more we make, the more we're taking from other people!
Pimp in Puerto Rico, pandering LAX to JFK
At baggage claim with three hoes, like Santa say (ho ho ho)
My third eye be the equivalent of the algebraic Pi
So if I give you a piece of my mind; it's multiplied times infini(tum)
Spiritually elevate so high, I commit driveby's while I skydive
Sip a Mai Tai, and perform shit only concieved in sci-fi
So why try test?
It's boom-bye-bye, Mr. Ice-Grill guy
You must be lookin somewhere else like Biggie Smalls' lazy eye
Ha, sicker than your average
Aquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome infectin faggots
