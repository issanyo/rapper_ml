[Intro: Dina Rae]
Ah (x7)

[Verse 1: Ras Kass]
I'm tryna rock Coachella on a [?]
Five thousand feet, raining down lightning from the sky like "Why Lord?"
Red eye like cyborg, mind tour
Like Afghanistan and Iraq, warfare with a mic cord
I fight for the little man like flyweight, I'm 5'4"
My rhyme book belong in a psyche ward
My minds eye, photographic memory bank too big to fail
Even if Wall Street had Alzheimer's
Threat to all rhymers and rock climbers, another Wall Street reference
God MC, fuck being famous
They say everything is big in Texas, so guess what my dick name is
These rappers sell they soul to get [?] anus

[Bridge]
And what would you do if you were me
My people die hard to live free, yee
Now what would I do if I were you?
Suicide would become a viable option like asking me if I could go back in time and kill baby Hitler
No question, I'm baptized Catholic [?] confession
Arm the African, Native American tribes with Tec-9s, land mines, colonialists die
Trade places

[Hook: Dina Rae & Ras Kass]
I wish we could change faces
Switch it up and trade places
Walk a mile in my shoes
W-Walk a mile in my shoes
Trade places
I wish we could change faces
Switch it up and trade places
Walk a mile in my shoes
W-Walk a mile in my shoes

[Verse 2: Ras Kass]
What if the world was female dominated?
Men got sexually subjugated, religiously incriminated
Cause evil started with men
When Adam bit the apple and created original sin
What if men got payed less for doing the same work?
Roles reversed and it was men who gave birth
9 months carrying 8 pounds in your ball sack
Paper turning [?] your job like "fuck all that"
Old female politicians want abortion illegal
But it's your testicles, homie, why these people so evil?
Or worse, you're in a culture where virginity's a must
To prevent intercourse they sewed your dick to your nuts
Where sex is punishable by death [?]
Instead of female circumcision they cut little boy's dick heads off
Shit, now how would you feel?
We live in a world with no compassion, it's so ill

[Sample]
So if an abortion could be considered, what about in the case of rape?

First of all, from what I understand from doctors, that's really rare. If it's a legitimate rape-uh-the female body has ways to try and shut that whole thing down

[Bridge]
Now what would you do if you were she?
Women's reproductive rights belong individually
And what would she do if she were you?
Abortion would become a viable option like asking me to forgive the murder of citizens by police
How they come in like Gestapo and occupy the streets
You forget that every American is an immigrant, except the natives
Building a wall is not our liberty, it's created
Trade places

[Hook: Dina Rae & Ras Kass]
I wish we could change faces
Switch it up and trade places
Walk a mile in my shoes
W-Walk a mile in my shoes
Trade places
I wish we could change faces
Switch it up and trade places
Walk a mile in my shoes
W-Walk a mile in my shoes
Trade places
