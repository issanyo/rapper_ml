[Intro: Richard Pryor]
Some fuckin' is good for you, though, Jack. Gettin' some pussy beats havin' a war. I ain't lyin', cummin' is a lot of fun

[Hook 1]
Drink Irish, smoke Jamaican
Fuck Brazilian model chicks on vacation
Shag hot Swedish girls on holiday
That's the American way

[Verse 1: Slaine]
You ain't in, early sobriety, girlie don't lie to me
I dirty your diary, your eyes all perverted and fiery
Her in the lobby, slurrin' and probably higher than I be
Dawg you're connivin', fast livin', how we're survivin'
Obvious I've been, brought up, caught up in violence
Psychotic, narcotic, hot white product environments
Sirens in bunches comin' to stop the bullets and punches
Streets is bloodthirsty, obnoxious, full of [?]
Runnin' 'em up, shitfaced, with her in the truck
Cuttin' it off, I'm grabbin' on her cunt and her muff
She wanted it rough
Told me that she liked to be choked
And get her hair pulled, I don't know, it might be the coke
But I'm a weirdo, kept her till the night could be broke
Drop her off, polish off a pint and light me a smoke
I don't need to be fixed cause I ain't actually broke
And at 7:58 I'm waitin' the Paki to open

[Hook 1]

[Hook 2]
Drink Irish, smoke Jamaican
Fuck a bad Canadian on vacation
Bag a Japanese girl on holiday
No work and all play

[Verse 2: Sick Jacken]
Drink Irish when there's no Tennessee
I wanna dick her down, one pint Hennessy
I know you've got Antonio mad, just don't let me see
Give me a jager without the bomb, no energy
Guzzle like a V-12, there's no end to me
Got it goin' on, I'm the envy of my enemy
This ain't no trust fund money, work carefully
Everything I have I obtained independently
The sickest man alive needs therapy
ATM account, no crutch, no parakeet
Do it all tonight, tomorrow's not guaranteed
Freeloaders fillin' up their cup where the [?] be
They got 5 on it, but drink 20 worth
Gentlemen jacks G, go ahead and serve
Let me get my purp, swerve, look for a miniskirt
Find a little bunny, let's see if the Henny work

[Hook 1] + [Hook 2]

[Verse 3: Ras Kass]
Jameson, breakfast of Champions
They love American, black, worldwide for rappin', son
I'm on spring break in summer time
Get to your girl's bottom like an underline
Goodbye bitches, good night bitches
Left stroke def with a mean right, bitches
Done 'em right, bitches, kegel all day
And keep it tight, bitches, even you dyke bitches
We doin' keg stands in the Netherlands
She blowin' me backstage and I just met her, man
And never took it out her mouth at all
Blame it on the ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-alcohol and molly
Prolly roll a couple spliffs then afterparty
Then after hours, then R. Kelly time
That's golden showers, and she off the powder
My Aston Martin is like Austin Powers

[Hook 1] + [Hook 2]

[Verse 4: Sean Price]
P!
Drink Irish, sniff Dominican
Kill your whole family, tree Branch Davidian
Dope comes three times, where the fuck is my dividends?
Simple rhymes from Sean but Sean ain't no simpleton
Medicated master, dedicated rapper
School of hard knocks, ock the educated rapper
Street smart on MLK Boulevard
Entourage packin' a gun, my son camouflaged
African ape, Jack Johnson, King Kong
Slapped to your face, Charles Bronson the big [?]
Gunned up already, thumbs up, Fonzarelli
Smacked over stupid shit cause Sean petty
Type to get your shit split in the club
And then have a peace treaty, nip the shit in the bud
You let shit pass, nigga
Fuck out my face, you bitch ass nigga, P
