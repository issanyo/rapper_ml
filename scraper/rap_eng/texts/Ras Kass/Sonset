[Intro]
Oh yeah, it ain't over motherfuckers
Yeah, we suppose to elevate not segregate
And we got love for the East
And I know the East got love for the West
But there's certain niggas, you know what I'm saying?
Wanna talk shit, dissing where I'm from
So basically, for every action, there's an equal and opposite reaction

[Hook]
Now I'm a rap fan who never saw Bam Rock the park
In the Bronx, but I still snap skulls in the dark

[Verse 1]
So can you recoginze shit is real
When I shove this ampex 4-9-9 up your rectum
I'm ready to bust every bitch nigga's cherry
See these floods in January got me lookin' in the mirror
Screamin' Bloody Mary
Unnecessary representing, equal set tripping
Divided by my tennis shoe pimping
Got all ya'll niggas dipping, like Lipton Tea Bags, son
His steelo Jeet Kune Do the way of the intercepting fist
Intercepting every subliminal diss
Geographic, prejudice against increments of incredulous legislature
Psychologically, I masturbate with the hands of fate
So bust nuts on Mother Nature, coming on your landscape
I'm pressing California license plate
For nigga's in all 50 fucking states
But its biting me and fighting me
Inviting me to rhyme I can't hold it back
I'm lookin' for the line
Takin' off my lambskin Marc Buchanan
'Cause I'ma make you see L.A. like Ed O'Bannon
Nigga come in peace and brothers can kick it
But you ain't gonna walk me streets
When back east you selling wolf tickets
Reciprocate the player hating
Bring the bullshit to you
Going through yo coast, like the Green Gary GNU
Who said no is good gnews
But gniggas is gnot gnowing about the gnext shit that I be flowin'
So don't represent at my expense
It's too expensive
The first and last line of my defense is my sentence
You got caught off the coast of the Pacific Ocean
Found face down floating
With your fucking neck broken

[Hook]
(Snap some neck for some live effects)

[Verse 2]
I walk the planet and create tremors
If nothing else here's all you need to remember
LLA'Y LLA KCUF for all you backwards-ass niggas
Psychologically, we grapple an MC
Like Gracie at the UFC so place me in your octagon
Coward on mixtapes and interviews, I'm hearing you
Certain dissidents dis from a distance
Disrespect and discriminate
Nigga I laminate that ass
And wear it at the New Music Seminar for a badge
Mash or get twisted
Dem gwan front like Rosa Parks
But them marks is broke wristed (bitch)
Superiority complex
Based on old statistics, now listen
Respect due to the pioneers
But what you borough did in 83'
Is ancient history brah'
So why these niggas acting like
Since they live in the state
That rap originates
They automatically, all time greats
It takes classic material to make phat shit
Not proof of New York residence and an accent
Who expresses the freshest
The West Coast was resurrected
By me, I'm the mother fucking man like homo erectus
So why it matter where rap started
If I wanted to hear from the asshole I would have farted
I'm a West Coast artist down with cliques from 510 to 516
But diss indiscriminately and you diss me
Fundamentally is the ability to smother suckers
So if rap was born to another then that makes me a motherfucker
Cause I'm the type of nigga to go to yo' show
Fuck yo' ho
Then nut on yo' promotional T-shirt
Alert the solar eclipse, the planet earth eternally verbally
I fucks your head up like Florence and Normandie, normally
(Normally)
(Easily I approach)

[Hook x8]
