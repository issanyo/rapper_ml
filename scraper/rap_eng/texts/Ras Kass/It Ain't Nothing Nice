[Intro]
Nigga, get yo' hand outta' my pocket
Nigga, get yo' hand outta' my pocket
(Buuuurp)
Fuck all y'all
Fuck all y'all

[Hook]
It ain't nothin' nice
It ain't nothin' nice
(It ain't nothing nice)
It ain't nothin' nice
It ain't nothin' nice
(Nada, nada)
It ain't nothin' nice
(it ain't nothing nice)
It ain't nothin' nice
(It's only real)
It ain't nothin' nice
It ain't nothin' nice
(Act like you know)
It ain't nothin' nice

[Ras Kass]
Son I be skimmin' through the billboard top for an R&B album
Wonderin' my outcome
Want the fat triangle, but I'm real with or without one
'Cause I'ma still sport wrinkles on my new jeans
Smokin' beadies to the pink stream
On a microphone, I'm like the mooly Michael Corleone, 36 zone
(Zone)
The homies  told me to be the man, understand
If niggas is playin' hardball, then why the fuck you throwin' underhand?
See only the small mind is small time
That's the reason that bustas still sellin' nickel sacks and ganja
You two-bit hustla, I'm the grown brother like clockers
Went and give you five cents to put cheese on the whopper
So steer near, deal, a mere near rear bia
I'm rollin' with the crowbar clear
Still wearin' my favorite suit like I was asshole naked
Now fake it till you make it, or take it, nigga

[Hook]
Oh, It ain't nothin' nice (Haha)
It ain't nothin' nice
It ain't nothin' nice
It ain't nothin' nice
(Nice)

[D.B.A. Flip]
My motions in school going through that whole childhood
Ya pushin' rocks on the block, 'cause the spots what ya found flip
I made my dough and I made sure I kept my name on tight
Layin' low in the day and turn the day by moonlight (Au)
They out of sight when they go wild
Just to let them [?] service cluck as they stroll by
Lowkey, the smokies know my name
Ain't no slippin' when they crippin', 'cause I done peeped game
Now I had closed, but then they raided, ran me out
I sold my last ounce, then I bounced to my baby mama's house
Time to bail, couldn't spend no time in jail
Had to be out on them streets, hurry up and make my sales
But now it's on, 'cause I'm grown and I'm still a G
But it's [?] I sell my crack by the tracks in this industry
Remember me, when you hustle runnin' right do or die, on the side flip for life
Biatch

[Hook]
It ain't nothin' nice
It ain't nothin' nice
It ain't nothin' nice
My nigga, it ain't nothin' nice
It ain't nothin' nice
It ain't nothin' nice
It ain't nothin' nice
It ain't nothin' nice, my nigga
Get your hustle [?]

[Ras Kass]
Now it's either give me the money, give me the power
Give me 4.25 an hour, what the fuck you think I'm gone do
To be honest with you, I'm gonna' get mine(mine)
'Cause I known niggas that's college graduates that's broke
Askin' for dimes and nickel sacks
Nigga give me that, and I give you some
You watch my back, I watch yours
I do rap chores while niggas be looking for the rapture
I don't understand, 'cause niggas gots to capture
Your own, now keep your eyes on the prize
'Cause Clinton is pimpin', nigga you might as well be chimpin'
I wanna be eatin' jumbo shrimp and lobster
I want 200,000$ in the bank, you wanna be the imposter mobster
Recognize like Sam Snead, I got 'em four twins to feed
So make the next man bleed, I just might
'Cause ain't nothin' right in my life
God help me (Help me)
It ain't nothin' nice

[Hook]
But, it's wrong
And ain't nothin' nice
It ain't nothin' nice
It ain't nothin' nice
It ain't nothin' nice

From LA to NY, ATL and back, it ain't nothin' nice
To all my niggas and my bitches, throw your motherfuckin' hands in the air
And keep 'em there
[?]

[Hook]
It ain't nothin' nice
It ain't nothin' nice
It ain't nothin' nice
It ain't nothin' nice
(Hahahaha)
Nigga, I can't sigh (Can't sigh, can't sigh, can't sigh)
Nigga, I don't give a fuck
[?]
