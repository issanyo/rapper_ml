[Verse 1: Ras Kass]
I be the cop in a plan fella
And I ain't got the patience of Mandela
Rather hop out the van yelling "Battlecry"
I'mma [?], give us free or give us die
Patrick Henry said in 1775
And he's an American patriot
So why when I say it they claim it's hatred
Pot calling the kettle, they paint you as racist
When they still discriminate cause the color of our faces
Disenfranchise ingentrificated
Disproportionately incarcerated
Racial profiled them, slayed them [?]
Hood with bamboos or they miseducated
Shit, but still we rise
Against Oscar Grant's murder and Oakland homicide
Fuck police it's time to ride
Against the American injustice, human rights violations worldwide
Your struggle is our struggle, our muscle is your muscle
From y'all fort to the back, it's all struggle
Ended [?], but the fight ain't done
Al Capone shit, hand me my machine gun

[Verse 2: Ras Kass]
I'm that Malcolm X photo, By Any Means
Peaking out the window with a M16
Still sagging my jeans, yeah my wrist may gleam
Bumping Wu-Tang, cause in this life it take cream
And after your money right, then you go to war
That's Machavellian, and The Art of War's core
I'm like Bilbo taking the ring to Mordor
Battling orcs, politicians, wizards and more whores
And if I'm forced to fight, the battle must be won
Starting with bitch niggas in these slums
Racist ass corporate America wrote the play
But my [?] watchmen said "Freedom ain't free"
And I wish the war was there, but the rich kill the weak
And I wish we could all just hold hands like Dr. King's speech
But it ain't so - 'till that day comes
I'm front line soldier, hand me my machine gun

[Verse 3: Ras Kass]
The laws of God are above the laws of man
I'm like David fighting Goliath, AK in my hand
Make em today when it's time to take a stand
Black Panther Party, Nation of Islam
W.E. Du Bois, Frank Douglas and so on
Cause they send you to Iraq to drop bombs
Come home and they still gon' call you a nigga
Boys call us [?], how's that not clear?
I've gone fishing, I'm not here
I'm on the roof, sniper rifle, I will pop here
Or hop out with the saw chase a nigga down
Place ammunition, point, lay a nigga down
Lyrically I weigh a thousand pounds
We withstand one hand holding a 50 cal
Assassinate all my enemies, then I'm out
Hide in Bolivia then escape to Liberia
