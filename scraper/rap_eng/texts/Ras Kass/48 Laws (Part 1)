[Intro]
Young Razzy put you up on game
Show you how to be a boss, so your nuts gon' hang

[Verse 1]
I've been in this game for years, it made me an animal
It's only pimps and hoes, everybody a cannibal
Rob Greene wrote the manual, I just transcribed it
To keep myself reminded, to succeed and grind with
Rule number uno, never outshine the master
Dudes at the top insecure, egotistical bastards
Threatened by a nigga if you better than them
Scared you shine too much, make more cheddar than them
Rule number 2, 2Pac told me
Keep your enemy's close, nigga watch your homies
Rule 3, conceal your intentions
Keep haters out your business
Quick to get jealous and try to monkey wrench it
Rule number 4, always say less than necessary
Like politician's rhetoric, keep 'em second guessin'
Rule 5, is guard your reputation
Intercept the hate in every situation
Rule seis, court attention at all costs
Ball 'til you drop but they claimin' you fall off
And Puff Daddy perfected rule number 7
Get others to do your work, but take all the credit
Rule 8, make others come to you
He been used bait, a lot of us learn 9 too late
Is win through actions, never through argument
Even if you right, they resentful wanna harbor shit

[Hook]
You gotta learn the tricks of the street [x8]

[Verse 2]
10, avoid the unhappy and unlucky
Negativity rub off, stop fuckin' with Schleprocks
Next spot, 11, what pimps and slave masters do
Keep people dependin' on you
Rule 12 is how you avoid animosity
Use selective honesty, disarmed with generosity
Marie Antoinette said "feed 'em cake"
That shit could backfire, find your head on a stake
13, when askin' for help, appeal to people's self interest
Like lookin' out for you is good business
14, pose as a friend, work as a spy
Watch them hoes, dog, they do it all the time
1-5, crush your enemies totally
No unfinished beefs, niggas scrimmage with heats
And get revenge homicidally
You don't wanna end up like O-Dog and Caine in Menace II Society

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Next rule's a jewel, stay exclusive as fuck
Don't be a regular, last asshole leavin' the club
17, stay unpredictable, 18, never isolate yourself
Rule 19 is good for your wealth
Know who you're dealin' with first, before you start cursin'
Offend the wrong persons, mothafucka then it's curtains
Rule number 20 is don't commit
Rule 21, seem dumber than your mark, play stupid
Deuce deuce, transform weakness to power
Let meekness devour, sweetness is sour
Concentrate your forces, don't spread yourself thin, son
Jack of all trades, master of none
That's rule number 23, here's 24 then
He got game though, but not Mike Jordan
Make the people love you, play the perfect courtier
Be that nigga, so they always supportin' yah
The little man be playin' the fool
So how you gon' win when you playin' to lose?
And when you master these, then come see me
Get your prescription refilled by Razzy PhD, nigga
48 laws of power
Here's the first 24 and it's not Jack Bauer
Young Razzy put you up on things
Show you how to be a boss, so your nuts gon' hang

[Hook]
