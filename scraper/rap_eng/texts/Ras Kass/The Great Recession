[Intro]
It is all out war on the productive class in our society for the benefit of the moocher class
The makers and the takers
The raccoons: they’re not stupid
They intend to do it the easy way
We make it easy for them; just like well fare recipients all across America
Welfare will create generations of utterly irresponsible animals

[Verse 1: Ras Kass]
Fightin’ with Ras
You Qaddafhi with a knife up his ass
Gun to the temple with blast
Simple and fast
Might switch up the tempo and spazz
Either Occupy Wall Street or get you some cash
Start wars in the Middle East and get you some gas
And if you not the 1% then get you some class
I mean get you some Adderall. Pay attention
The middle class slaves pay the wage of the rich an’
Corporations outsource to China, jobs missing
Emeril, Rachael Ray, too many cooks in the kitchen
Drones explode on homes to quench oil addiction
No correcting the system, economic nepotism
A world affliction, listen
Kill the old, poor, and non-white the mission
Of evangelical Christians, empty soul no conviction
Police state, a debtors prison
Because capitalism today is high tech lynching

[Hook]
700 billion bailing banks out of TARP (but, but, but, but wait it gets worse)
Families evicted out of homes living under tarps (but, but, but, but wait it gets worse)
CEOs with million dollar bonuses and black hearts (but, but, but, but wait it gets worse)
So I’m jumping out of water like a great white shark (but, but, but, but wait it gets worse)
Pentagon create tsunamis in Haiti so thank HARRP (but, but, but, but wait it gets worse)

[Verse 2: Doc Hollywood]
I’m still trying to learn how to break down a blunt
And roll it with one hand, dirty old man. Governate &
Father a child with my maid like Conan
Grow an afro and tan, be looking like soul man
Kick shit like don’t mess with the Zohan
Argue with my girl over head, Michael Lohan
Did enough blow to make abominable snowman
Blow jobs plus no hands equals romance
Call it the good old days… way, way back in 2007
Before the stock market crashed and Bernie Madoff went to heaven
I mean prison before The Great Recession
When the country knew we had an idiot for president
Before Oakland PD assaulted Iraq War veterans
Currently unemployed, our money no good the currency is unemployed
In Greece, people riot in the streets
We so underground, I’m leviathan on beats
Wall Street gamble your pensions and sell shares
Ask for justice they call it class warfare

But, but, but, but wait it gets worse
But, but, but, but wait it gets worse
[Hook]
