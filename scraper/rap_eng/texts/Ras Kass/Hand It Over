[VERSE 1 - 8-bza]

Call me Bizzy Deniro or 8 Stallone
Eye of the tiger on mics
Flowing with sight beyond sight
Obey me like Sprite
Or Mister Sickness
Influenza that's contageous
Outrageous
I shouldn't
But you couldn't match trying to say this!
Cadence of ancients
While times are forever shapeshifting
Jammed in reverse
Pull up the hearse
Time for casket lifting
You absent witted
I'm acid spitting
Souls are frigid
You better off with Activision
No games
Out of order
The mic's out of quarters
So as for hip hop
You could say I'm all for closing the boarders
I'm an eligible bachelor
So lock up your daughters
We stay fly
Why you think they make them giant swatters, killa?
You fools are Powerpuff
Garbage truck
Wack as fuck!
If I was a coach
Believe you me
I'd have to cut!
At least a buck
You ain't even worth 50 more
Cause you don't know thing one 'bout treating the mic like a filthy whore, sucka!

[Chorus - scratch quotes by Imaginary friend]

Hand over the mic!
Garbage on the mic while other fools can't manage
Hand over the mic-rophone!
Locked
Loaded
Ready to roll!
Hand over the mic!
Garbage on the mic while other fools can't manage
Hand over the mic!
Hand over the mic-rophone!
Oh yeah!
IT'S OVER!

[VERSE 2 - Ras Kass]

Call me Razzy Dustin
Hoffman
Dusting off men
Often Austin
Fucking awesome
Spit coffins
Fill them with a legion of rappers and leave ophans
For Madonna and Angelina
To adopt and get abortions
Source of distortion
I can offer you this portion
I'm a Horseman
Y'all kids just Mighty Morphin'
Heavy bars
A new demon to fight with
My mic's Mike Vick
Dog yo ass
Electrocute my bitch!
Huh!
Hit him so hard
He can't feel time tick
And y'all coughing up the rock like a Heimlich
So tell the world they need to get up on my shit
And all you niggas need to get off of my dick!
Sort of reminds me of equality
Y'all just ain't there
Me against you homie?
That just ain't fair
My werewolf fang's stuck in a lame duck
You get ate the fuck up like Wolfgang Puck!

[Chorus - scratch quotes by Imaginary friend]

Hand over the mic!
Garbage on the mic while other fools can't manage
Hand over the mic-rophone!
Locked
Loaded
Ready to roll!
Hand over the mic!
Garbage on the mic while other fools can't manage
Hand over the mic!
Hand over the mic-rophone!
Oh yeah!
IT'S OVER!

[VERSE 3 - 8-bza]

The pathogen and the Waterproof MC
Slaughter booth structures
If you ain't helping you harming
But you ain't alarming
We spit flames for the few of you out there still caring 'bout shit
And y'all ignorant drones
I pray to god you get a scare out of it
I got a pulse so hip hop is still living
Still giving the ill rhythm
It's just some fools ain't listening
Evolution is key
But they just regressing
Only when they bankrupt
They really learn a lesson!
Ras - you down to make them all rethink their professions?
[Ras Kass] - yeah
If they don't learn I guess we just gon' start beheading
Like P.E. said
It's gonna be bedlam
Taking their severed heads and straight jamming them in their rectum
You wanna speak ill of all of the god's endeavors
But your lineup's more fuckededed up than a barber with tremors
I gotta end it there before it gets too brutal
But you know
And I know
That it's just business as usual
WHAT!
