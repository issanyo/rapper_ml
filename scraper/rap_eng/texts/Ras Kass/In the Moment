[Verse 1: Ras Kass]
My city Spanish for “the angels”
I’m a native, Jackie Robinson was too
This Dodger fitted is my halo, azure blue, that’s number 42
I’m unplugged in Malibu, I was in Santa Monica, I had a lotta booze
And I’m around women, I love to turn you on
A day in the life, I’m John Lennon

Don’t mind me, I’m just zoning out
Overdosed on molly took a strong amount
The Ciroc say peach, bonfire on the beach
Watching the waves crash make my thoughts know peace

'Cause my thoughts so deep, like I’m under the bridge
Needle in my vein like Flea
I’m just living in the moment
'Cause everything else is just a bonus

[Hook: Ras Kass]
Let’s turn up on some 60s shit
Free love, free drugs, on some hippy shit
Feeling psychedelic on some 60s shit
Dread head, Dead Head on some trippy shit

[Verse 2: Ras Kass]
Ab-Soul from C-Arson
They asked "But can he make a Soul on Ice?”
That brother keep his darts sharpened
He always pouring out his soul on mikes
Sand in my Nikes, embers barking, dudes laughing, girls dancing
And the moon is bright
I’m unplugged in Cape Town
Long Street, how will I escape now?

Don’t mind me, I’m just zoning out
Overdose on peyote took the wrong amount
The Ciroc say peach, campfire on the beach
Hearin’ the waves splash make my soul flow free

'Cause I was born in the USA
Try telling that to Yasiin Bey
I’m just living in the moment
And everything else is just a bonus

[Hook: Ras Kass]
Let’s turn up on some 60s shit
Free love, free drugs, on some hippy shit
Feeling psychedelic on some 60s shit
Dread head, Dead Head on some trippy shit
