Ras Kass
Lock it!

[Verse 2: Ras Kass]
Yo! Yo!
Yo! It's a given that I'm taking
No shorts, not even from midgets
Spittin' cancer at your colon
Fucked bitches to death - 367 trojans magnums killed her
Wake up, her credit card is stolen!
And it's a given that I don't give a fuck
Like prostitutes, so show me the money!
Money, living bummy?
Oh! Ain't nothing funny, thunny
Straight inflatable lemurs? and fedoras?, ya big dummy!
Since a shortie, like Brasco?, my nose runny
The Roscoe chicken 'n waffles, I chose money
I rate flows, stank hoes and new Savannah Joes
Bank rolls, Black snow and white crows
I write prose for cons
Dangerous minds
Be in the hood like a rebuilt engine chillin with guns
We ghetto fab, I rode the hog, I'll be the mothafuckin Fonz
Now who rock Benetton sweaters and still racist?
Ras, the illest!

[Hook]
See it's a given, what I expect to get
Hiphop quotable every time that I spit
And it's a given, what you cannot be
That's me, mothafucka, the Water Proof MC
And it's a given, what I expect to get
Respect, money and bitches, nigga the whole shit!
See it's a given, given, given...

[Verse 2: Ras Kass]
And it's a given, that I ma get even
Like adding odd numbers!
Turn your wood-grain frame back to scrap lumber
Your mac thunder boomerang like down under
Slug ricochet off my chest, you catch underground slumber
My underground sound got crews bouncing like Flubber
I'm dumb nice, maybe Dumb and Dumber
And selling couples used rubbers
Like if I was pimpin pregnant women - a true mothafucking hustler
My least dope rhyme outsprint drug runners in Hummers!
A nigga backward hustled and started mugging muggers!
So I love it when niggas ask me:
"Ain't you Ras Kass?
Kick it wit dawgs with penitentiary scars?
Who bear arms like grizzly claws?
In German luxury cars?
Chillin' in luxury spas?
Expat bar menage a trois, hidin hoes bras?
Ghetto Superstar like Pras, so fuck yours?
Applause?
Givin peace to the gods?
Didn't you say you split airwaves like 3D jaws?
Don't your jaws Dominique Dawes across 46 bars?"
Of course, "I am", like Nas!

[Hook]
See it's a given, what I expect to get
Hiphop quotable every time that I spit
And it's a given, what you cannot be
That's me, mothafucka, the Water Proof MC
And it's a given, what I expect to get
Respect, money and bitches, nigga the whole shit!
See it's a given, given, given...

See I don't give a fuck, and I ma get paid
It's a given, I'm the illest emcee ever made
I don't give a fuck, and I ma get paid
It's a given, I'm the illest emcee ever made
Nigga I don't give a fuck, and I ma get paid
It's a given, I'm the illest emcee ever made

I'm the illest emcee ever made, made

See it's a given, what I expect to get
Hiphop quotable every time that I spit
And it's a given, what you cannot be
That's me, mothafucka, the Water Proof MC
And it's a given, what I expect to get
Respect, money and bitches, nigga the whole shit!
See it's a given, given, given...

See it's a given, what I expect to get
Hiphop quotable every time that I spit
And it's a given, what you cannot be
That's me, mothafucka, the Water Proof MC
And it's a given, what I expect to get
Respect, money and bitches, nigga the whole shit!
