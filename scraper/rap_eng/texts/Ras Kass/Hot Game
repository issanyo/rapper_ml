[Intro]
For my nigga Fred Jordan. Drank something, smoke something up in Heaven. Run it

[Verse One]
Now-a-days everybody gangsta, okay
Tell ya what's gangsta is this
Fuck with me, I toss the gat and beat yo' ass with this clip
Y'all man tans, sleep and eating studio thug
Bamboozle, Bambaataa
So who's hotter?
Lose nada
True rider, rock a pair of blue dada and new Prada
Brush my teeth with a fly swatter, spit pesticide
Pop your collar and spinal column make your neck divide
Mo' dirty
S.C. fo' thirty
Steering with my knee, eating a plate of beef curry
Gives a fuck, I'm trying to trephinate the game
So play like Chinese good and get low mayne/lo mein
Or face this capital punishment
But y'all gon' fertilizer, guess Ras Kass running shit
Plus doubt y'all thuggish men
Really own 2Pac and The Outlawz 80% of y'all publishing

[Scratch Hook]
"Hot game"
"They calling you hot" - Royce Da 5'9" 'Boom'
"It's a shame" - Big L 'Size 'Em Up'
MC's ain't spit no more
Hot game
"No competition to this shit we got here" - Method Man 'Funkmaster Flex Freestyle'
"The real shit"

Hot game
"Now it's a circus of clowns
A whole lot of lip from cliques I'd probably rap circles around" - Royce Da 5'9" 'Boom'
"Quit talking it's over" - Royce Da 5'9" 'Boom'
That's why
"Every time I spit, I tick to show you it's hot" - Royce Da 5'9" 'Boom

[Verse Two]
Now who the illest lyricist in the game today
If it's to ghetto plus hits then I'ma give it to Jay
If it's the most unit's sold gotta give it to Em'
And if I never move units I'ma lyrical them
Listening to Nas 'Illmatic'
In a Coupe drinking something 80 proof, fucking something Spanish
Point is, same shit different toilet
Shoot you went Back To The Future so your mom will get aborted
And don't tell me about disrespecting a bitch
When female artists on materialistic shit
Take a nigga whip and take a nigga chips
Like some profits from pussy lips like money clips
(That's some dummy shit)
Where I'm from we don't trick
Crip Walk and not a Crip you get yo' fucking ass kicked
Y'all faggots on some rap shit
Put wack shit on wax like Suzy Chaptstick
Wack bitch

[Scratch Hook]
"Hot game"
"Cause they calling you hot"
"It's a shame"

Hot game
"It's over now" - Big L
Rap dudes ain't spit no more
Hot game
"Now it's a circus of clowns
A whole lot of lip from cliques I'd probably rap circles around"
"My advice, quit talking it's over"
That's why
"Every time I spit, I tick to show you it's hot"

[Verse Three]
Ever winning a Grammy, rocking a body condom
Industry cats hop on your dick dog like ticks y'all
Sick naw? I spit RU-486
Wasn't down from the jump then get lost
I've been flossed by some of the hottest rappers and producers in the game
Told we couldn't do a song cause I ain't got no fame
Guess I'm not on Billboard so I ain't got no flame
Got head from a bald chick then she got Rogaine
A lot changed
X platinum plus
Got homies that follow your tours just to jack your bus
Plus we do selectively crew
The type of nigga to go to your album release party
Grab the mic then boo you
Like, "Who you?"
Fuck who's who, I'll make a nigga's doo rag do not want to
Nephew let's connect the dots, dead man
Select ya plot
Cause homie you ain't thug, that's your boyfriend's Glock

[Scratch Hook]
"Hot game"
