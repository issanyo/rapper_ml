[Verse 1: Ras Kass]
When shit go wrong they always blame it on Ras
Keep that thang on the dash, bitch with my name on her ass
Drive-by with the pistol while my feet on the gas
All my UK homies call that "bangers and mash"
Spit flame for the cash, mangle and spaz out
A hypocrite, enjoy throwing rocks from my glass house
Forgive me I just lash out
Ray's goggles, I down Jamie and pass out
Hong-Kong on flight, the flow Britta
Trying to Skrillex shows for mo' skrilla
First class, almost send the pilots presents
Stewardess close that curtain like "FUCK Y'ALL PEASANTS!"
Dick infinite
My pen Gillette, you tell her, you ain't saying shit
She kinda indiscriminate
Cause when I'm hitting it we enemies with benefits

[Hook: Ras Kass] {​x3}​
Enemies with benefits

[Verse 2: Ras Kass]
Now riddle me this
A little old lady stops
Hops out a wheelchair on [?] and LaMerk Park
If she use a cane to get to the bus stop
And gangsta's drive past, ain't she doing the Crip Walk?
I know, random shit I be thinking 'bout
Y'all shitty niggas prairie dogging, just peeking out
I'm like Carson's Batman, put the beacon out
4-5 just keep on keeping south
Nigga, the educated hood star
Few things I learned, don't stand behind Suge's car
So honk if you love Jesus
Keep texting while driving and you really gon' meet him
My ex chick hate my guts
But she still get horny and wanna let me fuck (bitch)
She kinda indiscriminate
Cause when I'm hitting it we enemies with benefits
