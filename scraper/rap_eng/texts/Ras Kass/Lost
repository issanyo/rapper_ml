(Hook)
Just because I'm losing doesn't mean I'm lost (lost, lost, lost)

Verse 1:
If I had a nickle for every time I had a nickle and dime
I'll be richer than every line that I done spit to a rhyme
Either way I'mma get paid like its an industry conspiracy
Silence maybe cause they fearing me and my born supremacy
But ya'll ain't hearing me
Silly me for standing up against the tyranny
But I don't speculate, cause I expect the hate
No good deed goes unpunished...wait
Dont ignore the elephant in the room
They wonder is Ras Kass relevant, fucken bafoons
These niggas bars ain't all that
You can trick these 16 year old girls but most of ya'll wack
It's a shame how hip-hop turned its back on skill
And let politics decide who's hot and not who's real
In fact pimping is alive in rap
But ya'll the hoes cause rappers literally be on the track
Niggas get fame then act strange
Don't be surprised when you see me chilling back stage
Still with a hot chick, rocking shit, looking well off
Just when you was thinking I thought that nigga fell off

(Hook)
Just because I'm losing doesn't mean I'm lost
(lost, lost, lost, lost, lost, lost)

"And even when I was close to defeat I stayed on my feet"

Verse 2:
You got platinum artists biting my punch lines
Like I ain't said that shit 6 years ago, lunch time
Go get your school meal until the school starts charging tuition and its all intuition[?]
Trials and tribulations put the god on the mission
Sacrifice till I get to the next level, it's all an audition
Till the machine kick in, then my pay raise increase
Like I've been in the NBA draft for 15 years straight, I'm a mothafucken beast
Overdue for a ring, Lebron, Miami Heat
Club promoters low balling, fronting on dough
Like city said overcharge him for every time they said no
See, the rap game like Vegas
The bitches all groupies and they mostly fuck with haters
So you ain't gotta ride with me
But when the phantom come bitch don't try to slide with me
Reached out to my friends in the biz asking for help
Ain't even return my call only concern with theyselves
Thanks for nothing
Thanks for fronting
But I'm aging backwards nigga, Benjamin Button
