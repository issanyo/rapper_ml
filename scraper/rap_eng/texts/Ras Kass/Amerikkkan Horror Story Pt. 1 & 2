[Part 1: Ras Kass]
{"You know what you are, you don't give a damn"}
Fuck this
The change that never was
How many times can you wash your hands of the innocent's blood?
Land of no love, home of the tyranny
Showed the whole world America's still on the wrong side of history
Non-threatening Negroes sing "Kumbaya"
Sistah Souljah tried to told ya, they want to start a race war
Brobama got elected, some call it a "whitelash."
In this election, the White supremacy strikes back
Past 20 years crime, national decrease
But more unarmed shootings by police
Increase in White hate groups rose 813 percent
Just because we had one Black president
These Christian zealots, the media neglected to tell us
Evangelicals the felons believe non-Whites are the Devil
Same thing in the '60's during the Civil Rights protests
Signs "interracial marriage is the Anti-Christ."
*spits* America spat in our faces
Trump came down the escalator then called an entire nationality rapists
Dissed China, Muslims and nigs
And half the country said, "He's just tell it like it is!"
Huh? The compulsive liar, war dodger, tax evader
Three-times cheater, he gon' make America greater?
Billion-dollar losers, xenophobe, misogynist
Possible incest committer, you ain't got a problem with this??
Christie, Guliani, Ted Nugent, Mike Pence
Roger Ayles; damn even FOX had some common sense
Damn...

[Part 2: Ras Kass]
2016 was a political coup with surgical precision
America's autopsy, let's make the 'Y' incision
This wasn't my decision
Lincoln, Kennedy, King, this wasn't what I 'visioned
"Make this world a better place", that should've been our mission
"Take our country back", rally cry of the opposition
3rd party split votes but people didn't listen
Blacks and millennials chose defeatism and indecision
Realest statistics I'll ever quote
3 party votes cost Hillary 90 electoral votes
Lost: Florida, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, Nevada
Arizona, Michigan and Utah
A lot of Blacks and young people didn't vote
'Cause they don't trust Hillary, thought indifference was "rockin the boat."
Nah, joke on you dick, of people who took the time to vote
71% was White, Latinos showed up
But we ain't back 'em up
We too busy "trappin" homie and that's wack as fuck
Trump won with less votes than McCain and Romney who both lost
So blame yourself, when your civil rights get fucked off
Put a sociopath in the most powerful seat
On an even extreme right-wing beat
Spiteful Republican Senate, Republican House
Appointing neo-con judges to the Supreme Court now
And that's a royal flush right down a solid gold shitter;
Exactly why the rich get richer
They want ObamaCare repealed, yeah
Twelve million people losing their healthcare, yeah
Women's Reproductive Rights gone, First Amendment Rights gone
1960's, they gon' send us back to Jim Crow
And trust, this 'legal weed' turning back to felonies
To fill the prisons somebody gotta build that wall for free
Deport 11 million Mexicans
Border Patrol Nazi Gestapo for the Texas men
And when we're mad as hell 2020 election
Remember they gerrymandered districts, practiced voter suppression
And that kinda is where we are, sadly
Feels like I'm watching America's series' finale
White Nationalists took their country back
But never offered Native Americans that, facts
I guess equality was never meant to include
Muslims, gays, women, Latinos or Blacks
They made us scapegoats
Lower class Whites, "Why so much hate, folks?"
Used dog whistles like the inner city and moochers
Hip hop thugs who sell their white children drugs
The KKK and NRA
With Putin, Wikileaks and the CIA
Evangelicals voted for Trump, the Amish voted for Trump
White Catholics voted for Trump, what the fuck?
Even Jehovah's Witness did this
Drawn to a message of reinstating White privilege
Claim to be the "Beacon of the World", liberty's flame
You just a nation of bigotry, we should all be ashamef
