[Ras Kass]
Everything I say don't be llello
Haters in batter rams, I slam
Like syringes in heroine, four hundred and fifty grams
Overdose, every coast, one hundred spokes chrome knock offs
And malt liquor bottle Molotovs
Don't gotta floss, huh, ain't that the truth
Flyin' in Booby's silver 600 coupe
Like whoop whoop, holla at me big baby
Sop me up wit a biscuit, cuz you know it's all gravy
Linquistical flow, I ain't Mystikal, but "Y'all ain't ready"
If a nigga don't rhyme about crack, clothes, pussy and 'fedi
Eat a dick, that's music to my balls
Like Gloria Estefan fuckin Hakeem Olajuwon
How this black lil nigga get more head than a beauty salon
Guam, blowin ya shit out like Chaka Khan
For sheezy, my favorite women is sleazy
Bisexual triplet freaks, forty five at they sexual peaks
I'm fuckin three Tony's, like Raphael Saadiq
And got a trick up my life, manufacturin cheese
I make tricks matriculate with melodies
Rehabilitated hood rats, shake the speezie
I'm tryin' to die filthy rich and +Ruthless+ like Eazy
C-Arson niggas is know for flossin'
But I still buy my T-shirts and socks from the Slauson

[Hook: Ras Kass & Curtis Daniels]
It's a must that I smash when I mash for me
Ass, cash, and gas, nobody ride for free
OohWee, they say, "Ras, are you a rider?
I reply wit', "Hell yeah, I'm a rider"
I give it up for C-Arson
That's the city north of Long Beach, southwest of Compton
They say, "Ras, are you a rider?"
I reply wit', "Hell yeah, I'm a rider"

[Ras Kass]
Watch me catch, Del Amo and the patch bitches
Fuck set trippin', homie, don't even trip
I never seen a hood wit' a retirement plan or medical benefits
I'm 'bout seein black folk wit chips, and hundred-thousand dollar whips
Instead of monkey see, monkey piru peelin' you wit' banana clips
I plan to flip my manuscript, like dyslexics
To set it, to bet it all, genetic telekinetic brawl
See, I'm the difference between booty calls and blue balls
Telethon wit Lou Rawls, and bevelin two percent off the top
S-s-sorry, Clinton got to break mines off
Decapitated, so where's he headed?
I decapitate niggas, damage is bodily
Put your tire on flat, and killed by a gat like Ennis Cosby
Ain't no "probably," ho: Recognize me

[Hook]

[Ras Kass]
My tennis shoe pimpin is more like twenty shoe
Cause no woman love me like the Remy do
I write raps while pullin' the lint off my nutsack
You 50% butt crack, I mean half-assed
MC's rediscover the mathematic format
Beneath your Norplant I'm guaranteed to come well
Like a reverse doormat, 64 bit Sega, 80 proof Cognac
And toll-free pagers
I'm still comin' out like unborn babies wit' hangers
My crew consists of millionaires, failures and gangbangers
The dangers of loaded language, like cocked heat
Got it made, me known for laid, paid, then shot out like suede
Raid the police, cuz they sellin' more crack then Latinos and blacks
See, we knows the facts, how Europeans jack
I'm sellin' Native Americans gats so they can take they land back
