[INTRO: RAS KASS]
Yeah, yeah
Flint Town, Dayton Family, I.D., Killafornia
Ras Kass, yeah, yeah
For all the Sophisticated Thugs
Yeah, for all the Sophisticated Thugs
We're going to dedicate this to y'all
In the memory of my homeboy Pac, like this
(Rest in peace)

[VERSE 1: RAS KASS]
A young nigga gotta keep the rims chrome
That's why my arteries pump brimstone
Disappear after breaking your chin bone
Ready to flip ten zones
I make my sense known
Feet to Terra Firma like bedrock to a Flintstone
Flint Town, Michigan
Who riders back up in this bitch again
Rolling like Bentleys on Michelins
You said life ain't shit but bitches and money
Chronic and Henny, taxes and tombstones
And slanging llello with killers on the payroll
But anyway though
If we did sell drugs
We're Sophisticated Thugs
Keep prepaid cells
So the Feds can't bug
Ras Kass, I.D., Dayton Family
Scared niggas don't cry
Cause we all gonna die
Spice boy niggas get Wesson
Cause they're all gonna fry
Open up some projects in Hell
They need more room
Cause most of y'all bitch niggas is coming there soon
(What)

[HOOK: BOOTLEG]
I don't give a fuck if you Blood or Cuz
Long as you got love for thugs (Sophisticated Thug niggas) (x4)

[VERSE 2: BOOTLEG]
All Eyez On Me
Hollering "Thug Life!" on BET
Gave the whole world the finger on MTV
2Pac Shakur, he was born to be a renegade
A product of the streets
Now look at what our streets done made
And took away all in the course of a day
Frivolous beef got me looking the other way
You used to say that you was never afraid to die
So put a blunt in your casket
Let you get your dead homies high
A true thug that was born to ride
Say what you say, when he passed away
The game died
It was You Against the World
I know that shit was crazy
Believe me though the whole world wasn't against you, baby
You told sisters to Keep Their Head Up and never switch
And if you switched, I bet you Wonder Why They Call You Bitch
Died too soon from unnecessary bullet wounds
Now college professors do lectures in their classrooms
On your lyricism
Damn Pac, I wish that you were here so you could hear them
Incredible, unforgettable, Biggie you was true
You're Nobody Until Somebody Kills You
Sophisticated Thugs!

[HOOK]

[VERSE 3: ???]
In the city where hands get blown
Every city I mash through
There's at least 60 niggas that'll blast you
Mash you out
Cash, stash and heat-seeking lies
On the day, only on the earth 16 years and already crazy
Maybe I'll get blasted trying to master perfection
Packing weapons, niggas tripping when you in the wrong section
Flexing muscles, we're tussling
Doing it only for nothing
Cause the fight is all over when the pistols get to busting
But that's enough, I don't think no one is listening
They're trying to make us think it's cool
The world order we're living in
But so every memory, and all the game that they're giving in
We're really giving in
Living life for the sin
And death
I bet somebody dies raw 'fore the end of this song
That's the reason why I pray
So I can make it back home
To be on top's where I belong
Can't afford not to succeed
But everybody's killing over clothes, bitches, and weed
It's plain to see it's about the money
But when they snatch the money
We're robbing for food like ain't nothing funny
In 1999, all major leaders have a meeting
Then the ATF and FEMA, black people they defeated
I said, in 1999, all major leaders have a meeting
Then the ATF and FEMA, black people they defeated

[HOOK]

[OUTRO: BOOTLEG]
2Pac Shakur, one of the realest thugs ever to pick up a microphone
I gives a fuck what anybody else says
Fuck what you heard
Fuck where you from
East or West coast, I don't give a fuck
I know who was representing
And who moved me when he picked up a mic and spit that shit
2Pac-motherfucking-Shakur
Died a soldier, lived a soldier
From the Cradle to the Grave he was thugging
And I know you bitch ass niggas feel what I'm saying
Thugs
