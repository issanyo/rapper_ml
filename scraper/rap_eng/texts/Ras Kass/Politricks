[Intro]
You know what politics are?
Let's break the word up
Poly meaning many
Ticks, blood sucking insects
So you know what politics are
We're gonna explain what Politricks are
Emilio Rojas, MZM....

[Verse 1: Emilio Rojas]
Dear Donald, I heard that you're a racist and a hypocrite
Paid 100 grand to take Salma Hayek to dinner but
You wanna ship her cousins and her family back
And all the minutemen with automatic guns, but who they blasting at?
Shouldn't be allowed to speak, all of that hypocrisy
If you get elected, turn the land to idiocracy
There ain't no democracy, the rich make the decisions
Islam and [?] gon lose all they religion
Don't excuse the shit I'm spitting, this is aimed at you
All the corporate corruption [?] affairs, they should've came for you
I don't even blame you though, I blame all your supporters
They just wanna live around a bunch of shit like they some hoarders
And nobody could afford to be, a Muslim or minority
Cause the Trump Gestapo gonna deal with us accordingly
I think your biggest problem is that you never think before you speak
And if you do, well that's what worry me, I'm sayin'

[Verse 2: Ras Kass]
Both political parties is private clubs
That's not a democracy, That's the mantra {?}
Demonic
Controlled by rich elite and economics
Never trickle down, and convict you if you brown
Shoot you in cold blooded murder if you black
But tell you join the Army, here's a gun, invade Iraq
Get em the oil, get maimed by a bomb
When veterans get home, congress can't blame Saddam
Wounded warriors can't get health care
Pentagon admits that this is corporate welfare
Making tanks they don't use, planes they don't fly
And immigrants do the hardest jobs to get by
Racist whites Brexit, here they blame the Mexicans
Stole all the land with California to Texas'
Remember the Alamo? Forgot the slave trade
Forgot they stole us from Africa, gave us slave names
Playing brain games, trick knowledge is not giving your citizens universal health or free college
Cause that's a investment in your country's future
America keeps it's citizens in ignorant stupor
Canada and Germany do it, but if
Bernie Sanders do it, he's a socialist
The banks steal from the 99 for the 1 percent
Congress takes orders from the lobbyists
The IRA sell fear to sell guns pretending
Republicans sell Christianity, and sell ethnic cleansing
Private prisons, military industrial complex
The game's rigged, you was never winning the contest
And they wonder why the country's going to shit
Politricks

[Verse 3: MZM]
Dear Donald, tell us the truth, what you wanna do?
Word to Big L, your mama should've swallowed u
We different skin pigment, that's why you beef with us
But them tanning beds turned your skin to Dorito dust
And this whole time, you been on a campaign
People asking questions, but you ain't answer a damn thang
All you do is talk shit, pop shit, drop shit
Bet a crisis come, and you won't stop shit
I'm a Muslim, born here same as you
Part of society, pay taxes same as you
Scratch that, I pay, u just commit fraud
Bullshit about your worth, when confronted, get pissed off
Dog, you reopened the scab, holding us back
Said get over the past but that's a joke and a half
And hope you dimwits comprehend this
You can't make us great again, we wasn't great to begin with
Racial divide, buried under beneath
And what you did was expose the Klan from under the sheets
And fuck the media, cause y'all cause damage too
Thinking that practicing my faith'll make you radical
Here's a lesson, lemme teach you perception
They'll take my aggression, spin it off with deception
They got people brainwashed, as if it's a movie
Thinking a hijab and kufi, means we'll bomb and shoot things
And every time shots ring, they hashtag it up
Extreme and radical then point hands at us
Causing mass panic trying to pass a ban on us
Abandon us, made a bandwagon just to banish us
But we peaceful, not the way you describe it
And we come in all different shapes and sizes
Can't tell who's one of us, how you gon' try dude
Cause some of us are white too, think about it, haiku
Nonsense embedded, pathetic, I said it not to set it
When I yell Allah-u-akbar, I'm unapologetic
You define hate with the message you harbor
Give this shit a rest but first apprentice your barber
Making known issues off what you can't control issues
Circus show issues, bounce
Take your taco bowl withchu
You're the cancer disease, yeah, we need an IV
Here's my circumcised dick, that's a Muslim ID
