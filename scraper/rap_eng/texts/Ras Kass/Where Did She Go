Chorus:

Verse 1:
I grew up listening to everything
From De La Soul to NWA
Never thought I'd see the day
That skills don't matter, record labels got fatter
To rappers WWE being real don't matter
And youngsters tell me I'm out of touch
Cause I don't wear skinny jeans that expose my nuts
And I'm supposed to what?
Act like most ya'll fucks wear some chucks
I'd rather be in the cobra clutch
Rap niggas get exposed and its nothing new
Cause the kids confused and they as fake as you
I expect rap to evolve and I know the biz is corny
And everyday niggas sell they soul to get money
I just never expected it
To be disrespected
By strippers and snitches who claim they perfected it
But maybe they did cause their show on tour
So maybe she changed and I just don't know rap anymore
(damn!)

Chorus:

Verse 2:
Now it's a ringtone game so everybody chasing hits
And even some of the greatest just ain't saying shit
Like they going through the motions
They groupie only smoking
Trash nigga get hot, next album you cameo em (eww)
Woah, guess we karaoke then
Cause every nigga rapping sound like the one right before the end
The same outfit, with the same ass flow
Talking about they got swagger, for heavens no
Ya'll got clones
That's clones of some clones
I'm an asshole but I solve riddles like bones
Some use the guys of hip-hop to promote homosexuality
Or at least sexual ambiguity
Man it be
Hard to tell men's clothing from the women
And the girls making out cause the boys so feminine
If it wasn't for Rae album and Slaughterhouse I wouldn't flow
Cause maybe rap changed and I don't know it no more

Chorus:
