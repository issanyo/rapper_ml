Pollute the airwaves with all these wack songs on
Gassed up niggas putting holes in the ozone
My homies smoke trees til the bongs blown
Global warming so the hoes ain't got no clothes on

Its time I go green but I don't recycle
Homie, I make my own lane like a motorcycle
They call me arrogant and sorta trifle
Rob a nigga Jackson, and moon walk like I caught a Michael
Spit accurate as a sniper rifle
And if I like your girl, I let my hotter wifey skype you
Right before I pipe you
Reach over and grab her ass cheek and tell her goodnight too (true)
They always gonna bite you
Deny you exist, religious right
That's why the humidity so high
Stupidity so high
Record breaking temperature, so everybody fry
Intelligent design, so their gas price rise
Catch this silver bullet, Mr. Soul on Ice
Product of Ice-T, Ice Cube, few more
Niggas claim they fuego, Im too cool though
My nuts hang low, so I walk in their studio
Dipping 2 Plutos
And they menudo
Catch me in a fucked up sweat-suit like Hugo
Scratchin a lotto
Orderin an iced caramel macchiato
Raspy Soprano
Selfish tweeter, don't ask me to follow
Ask me my motto
Ass in the grotto
Pass that bottle, to Ras Kassiano

[Hook]
Pollute the airwaves with all these wack songs on
Gassed up niggas putting holes in the ozone
My homies smoke trees til the bongs blown
Global warming so the hoes ain't got no clothes on
Chilly chill in the cold microphone zone
Polar cats melting, putting holes in the ozone
I want the crown too, I ain't watching no throne
All in friendly competition, though its on homes

The bronze Fonz who's fond of blondes
So I cut down Amazons, in the tanning salon
Y'all just niggas with pom poms, that twirl batons
And I'm
Ego-maniacal like Sean John
When its all said and done
And all the cheese raked
Half the industry walkin to Brooklyn to get me some cheesecake
Frozen arms, I'm so beyond
Might hop in your iPad 2
Turn to Tron
Layin niggas so flat, homies think you plankin
Only realize you dead, when the corpse start stankin
At least you bio-degradable
I am unfuckwitable, unfadeable
Inhospitable, Sahara Desert
And still washin oil off you pelicans feathers

Drill baby drill though
Kill a baby seal flow
Rasy got the coldest mouth piece, without a grill yo
Should be on the blade, mackin hoes at Fillmore
40 below, no Timbo
You too commercial, Chernobyl
Givin off radiation
Like Dasvidaniya
Stoli Vodka mixed with acqua panna
Just tryin to make a better life for my kids
Flamboyant rappers keep fuckin with my eyelids
Got these Gucci shades
To block your UV rays
If your station play wack shit
Need some new DJs

[Hook]
