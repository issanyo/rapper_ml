Xzibit Intro:
Yo it's the almight Xzibit. In the Law House huh
With Laylaw huh and D-Mac huh (Ras Kass)
Ntroducing huh. The nigga Ras Kass ha
We all know and love him ha
Yo let's bring it through youknowhatI'msayin'
Bring that shit through nigga. What's up yo yo

Ras Kass:
Well it's the R double AK triple S the letters of my name
For you and your bitch to unscramble on Soul Train
This Arch Angel got niggas shooked like crack babies
I think of bomb shit like my brain was made outta M-80s (caviar)
I flow 16 Pablo Escobar perverse perversion' so fat my dick got a double chin
My MCin' produce more semen than wet dreamin'
Of hostin' BET with Rachel in the Caribbean
C-arson home of niggas with gold Visas and heaters
Sendin' Jesus subpoenas
(Got you singin' duets with Selena nigga)
So Sister Act
Cause black nun (none) get love
And I'm a have juice till Mark Ferman plants the bloody glove
I drive European cars and smoke Cuban cigars
Bring it phat to your ears like Warren G's keyloyds
From B-boys to D-boyz it's like shippin' keys from overseas
Please I move MC's like o-zes

Hook:
See niggas from outta town don't even fuck around

Ras Kass:
But there ain't no angel that you can strangle Los Angels

Xzibit:
See handguns and girls that's the way of the underworld

Ras Kass:
There ain't no angel that you can strangle Arch Angels (say what?)

Ras Kass:
See left coast niggas is the Craziest
I dodge shotgun pellets in the felonious Los Skandalous
Golden State
Home of dysfunctional gang truces
5.8 quakes where glass houses pancake (westsiiiiiide)
But I be in the hood like a rebuilt engine
Fuck what I'm benchin' I weave through tracks like extensions (nigga)
I'm ridin' for chips like on time on motorcycles
And for looters to get trifle
I'm like a chink on a Slason swap meet roof with two automatic rifles
Puberty got me Vicious
And these generation X bitches is too big for they britches
15 goin' on 30
"I wanna fuck" written all over their faces with mack compact blowin' kisses
Promoted like seven oasis gettin' niggas twisted in statutory rape cases
But I write rhymes in enough white lines askin' Melle Mel my punchlines
Hit from the baseline like six by nines
Crack addicts and Reggie Miller
That's fo reala
I X more Hollywood Squares than Phillis Diller

Hook:

Xzibit:
Yeah niggas from outta town don't even fuck around

Ras Kass:
But there ain't no angel that you can strangle Los Angels (yeah)

Xzibit:
Welcome to the place where niggas make moves

Ras Kass:
Nigga there ain't no angel that you can strangle Arch Angels

Xzbit:
Handguns and girls that's the way of the underworld

Ras Kass:
But there ain't no angle that you can strangle Los Angels (ha)

Xzibit:
Home of the scandalous big bad Los Angeles

Ras Kass:
But there ain't no angel that you can strangle Arch Angels

Ras Kass:
You know man all I have in this world is two things man
That's my word and my balls
Or maybe that's three things
So on microphones I let my nuts hang like John Homes
And took so many niggas out I should change my name to Chaperone
D-Mac and Laylaw know that on mic cables
I got one thousand two hundred techniques similar to the turntable
So if it's crem de la creme since I'm smarter I oughta
Float like dead bodies in water
Manana tell your girl this here mayatti got one extra backstage pass
If she put 'em on the glass
Cause she be jockin' rappers that be seen with who's who
The single charters so she blows me for a hit like cluckheads do
No MC parallels they behind bars like Rick's jail cell
To rock well I need a beat like...
Child abuse victims (ha ha)
Everything I say turn to yay
This shit was blowin' kids away before Timothy McVeigh

Hook

Xzibit outro:
Yeah yeah straight from motherfuckin' Xzibt ha ha and the Lawhouse
YouknowhatI'msayin' with that nigga Ras Kass (he's guilty)
Yeah yeah. Break it down. It won't stop. West coast hip hop (yo yo)
It's the almighty Xzibit (booyaka)
