Chorus:
(4x) Jack Frost nipping at your nose
(sample of Nat King Cole)

I'm sporting Triple down rain gear
Dumping on flying reindeer
And that overweight queer with the red and white sleeping apparel
Sliding down the chimneys, but staring down this double barrel
I'm putting Santa on alphabetical Medi-Cal
It's survival of the fittest as the milleneum approaches
By then the only existing life on Earth is real niggas and roaches
But see, I'm colder than nuclear winter
So concoct the contender, I'll make a nigga change agenda
Change gender, change men to feminine
Women in masculine genitalia
Seasons beatings 'til the next Saturnalia
Ain't no competing, defeating all persons in paraphernalia
Compel me to inhale the aroma
("I smell.. I smell.. I smell PUSSY!!!")
My nigga, you could use some heart like a fucking organ donor
In conflict, whenever you plan it, I'm a split it like the equator
My Sanskrit box an' liquid nitrogen strike the mics colder than polar
I'm like "Wonder Twins Activate!", pimp in the form of icy boulder
Mister sister sister, fool I'll make your scrotum blister
Fool, if you ready to be the man then I'm a hit ya
Like Bar Mitzvah, the ideal
I'm the rhyming Simon Phoenix with that "murder, death, kill."
You got me all fucked up, I'm the abominable flow-man
Kiss ya ass goodbye. Your record deal was standing under mistletoe
And I'm Mandingo
My cultural experiences doesn't include Kris Kringle
Celebrating Satan, no, sorry, Santa
It continues to be a mind boggler
When black people be picking shit off the ground
And eating it like a toddler
I shoot the gift like Kwanzaa
That holiday is pagan, 626 like Mazda
And a billion bucks a fuck
That's bringing up the slack in the gross national product
Like water, my mind avalanches expressions
And from papas erection and mama's C-section
Before Norplant contraception conception
The only exception was the immaculate deception
Cause contrary to what my bereaved mother believes
Jesus was conceived by a Mitochondrial Eve
I leave gangrene when I slang these below zero
So niggas better bring more "Heat" than Al Pacino and Robert De Niro

Chorus:
Jack Frost nipping at your nose
(sample of Nat King Cole)

Gollllden State Waaaarrriioooors, come out to pllllaaayyyyyyyy!

Ha haaaaa! Yo. Yes, Yes, Yes

This goes out, you know, to the West Coast
All my niggas on the East Coast
All my niggas down South, you know what I'm saying. All them phat Dj's

All the heads, and all them bitch ass niggas, you know what I'm saying

(DJ Rhethmatic Scratching Nas sample from "It Ain't Hard to Tell)
"I'll leave them froze like heroine in ya nose"
