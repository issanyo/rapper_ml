This ain't a diss record man
This a real record
(Ooh ooh ooh ooh)

[Verse 1: Ras Kass]
You got 99 problems and a bitch is 98
Funny watching like gang green eyed mamas boy tape
Head back to the fact anyway
Me versus you
(?)
(?)
He should go fry seafood and jump out a cake
You getting kicked in the noggin click like
Razzy's dick jump in and out of chicks
Spit
And I'm back on your case
He couldn't be a real nigga with the black paint on his face
Washington D.C. had to pack an estate
And I ain't never (?)
But a smack in the face
Cause he make diss records
Get cracked in the face
So you forever sidelined
Bitch back of the race
Spread lies about me
But we all know the real
You'd groupie my baby's mom for a fucking record deal
Bitch

[Hook: Paul McCartney]
Say, say, say
What you want
But don't play games
With my affection
You, you, you
Stay away
So long girl
I will see you never

[Verse 2: Ras Kass]
You can't make me love you
Bitch you can't buy me
Try me
Forced to say goodbye to me
Tell me I'm heartless
Cause I stay focused
You try to derail me
Hope I stay hopeless
I'm way out of your league
That's why you're insecure
If I leave you
I could get to more
Money don't define me
Even if I'm broke
I'm rich in character
And its America
I got hustle
My will don't break
So if I ain't shit
Why you call for two hours straight
Do yourself a favor
And leave me be
My life ain't (?)
See everything I lost I could get again
And I don't want no woman if she not my friend
Understand what you did to me
Homie made me resent you deeply
So

[Hook: Paul McCartney]
Say, say, say
What you want
But don't play games
With my affection
You, you, you
Stay away
So long girl
I will see you never

[Verse 3: Rass Kass]
I be tripping off my so-called homies
They meet my bitches, they try to tell on me
Like Ras do this, and Ras do that
Ras got other bitches, why you got Ras back?
And you would fuck mine up except I'm real
Girls I fuck with already know my deal
They like yah I know, you and your mouth like a hole
And that's the reason I let weak niggas go
So

[Hook: Paul McCartney]
Say, say, say
What you want
But don't play games
With my affection
You, you, you
Stay away
So long girl
I will see you never

[Outro: Ras Kass]
Yo check this out man
You wanna know something funny
How a motherfucker be mad at you
Cause you don't wanna fuck with them
