When I'm walking on the scene
Like Akeem The African Dream, mean
Fuck your life and sipping lean
I been in the hole like I overdosed on Ketamine
Then jumped up out with a better scheme
Full-steaming ahead and headed to get this team to scream
You ain't agreeing?
We ain't being civil lil' b*****s like Cybil Shepherd
We freezing 'em with weapons like Duncan in Double Dribble
Brittle plate of vittles, get your body broke
Jake Palumbo, Road House & the album got you by the throat
Over the ropes, choke, no hope
Just toke like a chief does
I been dealing with these childish angry underground angry artists
So long that I know they need a brief hug
And I'm over the emotions and Different Strokes my favorite show
So I don't watch these Re-Runs
Watch us leave guns, leave blood in a crisis
Leave you lifeless like a pre-cum
Got a license for this mean drum, I'm Seagram's
We run this racket like Acolytes
Terry Bradshaw, this the sacrifice

HOOK - Jake Palumbo

This is Rated E for Everyone
Wolfenstein 3-D, cheat codes for every gun
For every schmuck that say I'm too hard to market
I'm Jackie Shell with his eyes on target
And if I had a guarantee I wouldn't go to hell and fry
I'd have illegitimate kids & bad people would die
Try to hold my liquor, long run thinking bigger
Jackie Shell, Bounty Hunter with his finger on the trigger

VERSE 2 - Jake Palumbo

It's a stick-figure line between genius and insanity
Every day I lose my keys plus my faith in humanity
Faceless, Sean Hannity, bar-faced lies
Spoiler Alert: Life ain't fair, Scarface dies
I'm a product of the 3rd worst schools in America
Where they break into Rite-Aid with butter knives & a Derringer
Brutal staff sergeant in Platoon, Tom Berenger
I'm 11 years down, can I last another decade
In this god-awful oddball occupation
I'm obsessed with slinging cock and balls in mid-ovulation
Hit my side-chicks raw, wear a condom in the hot tub
What kind of sense does that make? My logic is impossible
Get high and preach the gospel, Jake The Snake Roberts
Never let a lazy artist disrespect my pockets
I'm booked too solid, circuit judge got the docket full
Why settle for crack? This amphetamine rocket fuel

(REPEAT HOOK)

VERSE 3 - Ras Kass

I'm B.B. King calling out your TV screen
Contorted like that bitch from The Ring, the blue scene
Lead guitar string gets picked
On the chitlins circuit
I paid dues till I paid off all debts, but still never get no service
My credit score should be 851
Caribou Lou with the 151, go dumb
Feeling so numb, I can't feel my Face-book
This bitch sniffing Adderal on my iPad
That's why I hate Brooke, but thanks, Brooke
You gave me some life bars
It's just another day at the beach like being a lifeguard
Homies pack blammers, so when you feel the burn
It won't B. Sanders
Guerillas with bananas, we shoot Tarzans
And peel your wig back like George Costanza
Call the ambulance or meet up at the rapture
Adapt to evolve & conquer tatted on my bicep
I'll probably f*** my country up like Wyclef
