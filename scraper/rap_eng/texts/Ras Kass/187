[Intro: Ras Kass]
What up Diamond?
You know it's going down
Stunts, Blunts and Hip-Hop nigga
One more time, one more again
We in the drug lab
Watching the first Planet of the Apes
You know what afterbirth is right?
Well this is death's afterbirth

[Verse 1: Guilty Simpson]
When I call late with intents to motivate
Spread love cause I know the hate
All too well, I been through hell
And back, then return with a story to tell
Listen: I had a rough transition
Peasant with a king's ambition
Imperial, toast with no cereal
Will visit you if you need a visual
The General, I generally
Move at a pace something like General Lee
I write from left feel, the best yiel
Face so familiar, remember the G
Hit em with the semi and flee
Try to go from MC to the front of a T
Literally - like that quick
When real life interferes with rap

[Chorus]
Deadly with a pen
Multiple 187's
Rest in peace
Deadly with a pen
Multiple 187's
Rest in peace
Kick your front row in and drag them out

[Verse 2: Ras Kass]
This is death's afterbirth
Fly on a corpse and you ride in a hearse
Family crying, your spirit just glide from the Earth
Like July on the 4th
Mister you just a guy in the dirt
Mind a weapon they can't find in a search
I satisfy your widow with the size of a girth
I dive in a tsunami and arrive in a surf
Standing on Shamu in a referee shirt
Can't compare me, I'm the best
Work at the [???]
Twist MC's like they possess [???]-leptic, do the metrics
If ya pop is dead then I'm a vampire on records
Undead, haters wanna take me out of my zone
You can't push my buttons I'm a iPhone
Diamond, Diggin' in the Crates: art
I dig in your chest and rip out your beating heart

[Chorus]
Deadly with a pen
Multiple 187's
Rest in peace
Deadly with a pen
Multiple 187's
Rest in peace
Kick your front row in and drag them out
