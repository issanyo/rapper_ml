Rasy, Dustin Hoffman
Dusting off men
Often Austin
Mr. mother fuckin' awesome
Live from C Arson
My statement's Californiacation
I fuck words up and masturbate with the bass then
Come in the speakers face then
Call that a money shot
No freestylin, show me the money, I make ya bunny hop
Tummy knot
Funny like a hot chick, crying, nose runny snot
Mascara smearing, why won't he stop
I'm Leonidas, got all my Spartans cheering
Kick you dead in the chest
Down a well you're disappearing
My shits so USA, it's UK
Might speak the queens English
While I'm drunk driving the wrong way

Chorus
I'm from the Dub
12th Planet from the Dub
Double dose of Dub Step
West coast dub
West coast dub
West west coast dub
Double dose of dub step
West coast dub
[ Lyrics from: http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/r/ras_kass/west_coast_dub.html ]
Verse 2
Put me in the octagon
With the octomom
Near a tent with eight tentacles
Swiss army knife, I perforate your ventricle
Ho's be on my genitals
I'm just a sexy bastard in general
O.C. says you like the vitamins and minerals
12th Planet will spin a show
Ras Kass will spit a flow
You hit em high, I high em low
Celestial and gigolo
But you all don't hear me though
I duck haters like George Bush duck gators
Actually he duck loafers from Iraqi reporters
The raven up in your Scion
Let me Edgar Allen Poe ya
Niggas flow is Detroit Lions
Whole 16 to 0
Party in the sewer
Underground super hero

Chorus
I'm from the Dub
12th Planet from the Dub
Double dose of Dub Step
West coast dub
West coast dub
West west coast dub
Double dose of dub step
West coast dub

Verse 3
Slumdog Billionaire
Bought a lifetime supply of Bidi's
Your sweet ass deer meat
Probably die of diabetes
Science like Archimedes
In the age of rap graffiti
Break dancing
Now I'm advancing sipping Riunite

Jeans is 300 a pop
Bitch I'm shallow
Fuck it, sue me
Or just feed the boy his alpo
Dog eat dog and hogs eat shit
Do I don't eat pig
Hate cops and smoke cigs

If the world was a blender
I would peel these nigga's wigs
Fly around rushin' mother fuckers like 3 MIGs
Probably went over your head like foreskin
Just remember nobody ever do it like we did

Chorus
I'm from the Dub
12th Planet from the Dub
Double dose of Dub Step
West coast dub
West coast dub
West west coast dub
Double dose of dub step
West coast dub
