[Intro]
(Skillz)
(Rassy Kassy)
Ain't no way out the streets but up and down, look around
Either six figures or six feet under the ground
Ain't no way out the streets but up and down, look around
Either six figures...Yeeah
(Yeeah)

[Verse 1: Ras Kass]
My new motto is mash with a passion
Stash cash and rock fashion
Try everything once, except incest and folk dancing
Reminiscing is cruel to a has-been
So cry now, laughing at the assent
Revenge is a struggling niggas best friend, believe that
Make the bubble even sweeter
Puffin' the Cuban go even with a diva meet her
G's up, hoes down, Lewinsky style, swallow the leader
Bitch nigga, swallow the heater
Eat a hallow millimeter, you can't follow a cheetah
Beat a genie emcee? You better bottle your beat up
'Cause I'll murk your whole single with exclusive freestyles
Ras be locking peniles with The LOX like free Styles
Death by spit 'til I'm deaf or senile
What happened to me? Like D.O.C
Branch through my esophagus hanging from a tree, nigga
And while the L.A. respect the flow
The realest, the next Makaveli, unbelievable

[Chorus: Ras Kass]
Ain't no way out the streets but up and down, look around
Either six figures or six feet under the ground
Ain't no way out the hood but up and down, look around
Either six figures or six feet under the ground

[Verse 2: Skillz]
A lot of y'all try to match my wits
End up collapsing like Elvis by the toilet trying to match my shit
The way I stack my chips, it's a shame
You a dealer? Deal with the fact that I won't get out of the game
So get out the lane and do the shit fast
'Cause your little neutral ass ain't got enough power to give gas, get it?
Look at the look on your face
I should've known from your short little tour bus you wouldn't get it in the first place
Six figures or six feet
I spit and hit sixty rappers over a sixth of a beat
In zero to sixty Skillz bring the heat
And once you try the same thing you'll lose sixteen of your teeth
Hit up Jake? They can't do shit to me
And if they catch Ras, we making history
Come on fam, you running with kings
It will be the first time an East nigga break a West nigga outta the bing

[Chorus: Ras Kass]
Ain't no way out the streets but up and down, look around
Either six figures or six feet under the ground
Ain't no way out the hood but up and down, look around
Either six figures or six feet under the ground
Ain't no way out the hood but up and down, look around
Either six figures or six feet under the ground
Yeeah

[Verse 3: Skillz]
Listen up, I'ma tell y'all cats how it goes
How that little dude from VA spit his flows
How he always in the club with a mass amount of hoes
But you already know that so...
Listen, check it, this rap game is getting a little retarded
I'm ahead of my time like a day after tomorrow
But I'm still cocky still talking greasy
Still walking pass your whip chilling with your breezy
Now, I know what you're saying, "He's just like us"
But you wrong homie, you could never be like us
I hit the town, pull a dime piece, hittin' the clown
I tell a chick to pack it up or put it down, thinking now, yeah
Show respect or I'ma have to slap you
Plus I'm the best I don't really fuck with rappers
'Cause, a lot of 'em got too much gall
Y'all speak, I speak, but I don't fuck with y'all

[Chorus: Ras Kass]
Ain't no way out the streets but up and down, look around
Either six figures or six feet under the ground
Ain't no way out the hood but up and down, look around
Either six figures or six feet under the ground
Ain't no way out the hood but up and down, look around
Either six figures or six feet under the ground
Ain't no way out the hood but up and down, look around
Either six figures or six feet under the ground
