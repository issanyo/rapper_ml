Elite Year ft Ras (Lyric Sheet)

Chorus:
We want shots of Patron, yea, getting it on, Stayin Blown ain't nobody going home. We want shots of the goose, make the ladies get loose. Got respect like bishop in juice. 24/7 we don't go to sleep here. 366, even in the leap year, uh, even in the leap year 366, even in the leap year

Verse1 Patrick Antonian:
Take the swooper right over the hill. them valley boys, piecing up we gone spend about a mil. fresh dressed with a license to kill. Ready to start it right. shot of patron cheers up to the party life. Hollywood nights turn to hollywood days, before the suns coming up we gone hop off the stage and hit the after hours popping at 2/3 like jordan, we ain't leaving till 6 in the morning. Then we cruising off back to the telly, drunk as fuck ima put it in her mouth. Acanelly. Bumping that makiavelli actin a fool. middle finger out the window till we back to the room. another epic story shot out to T and 40, shot out to cousteau & OMG them the homies. Buying out the bar in hollywood restaurants, AJ tell em what the fuck we want

Chorus:
We want shots of Patron, yea, getting it on, Stayin Blown ain't nobody going home. We want shots of the goose, make the ladies get loose. Got respect like bishop in juice. 24/7 we don't go to sleep here. 366, even in the leap year, uh, even in the leap year 366, even in the leap year

Verse2 Ras Kass:
Dilated brains evoke, hop out covered in smoke. Shoot through the nose, park my shit in the from row. Hot nigga status, my bitches badest. I don't pay, I don't wait in line, they know who Ras is. Radical dictator, ima a fuckin fashist. You and your girl friends, jeans, fashion faggots. I got hoes from carson to calabasas. That live next to Kardashians with fatter asses. San Fernando Valley, where the ladies at. Los angeles girls make it crack. Im back stage vip, drinking out the bottle like mr marcus Im a real hard act to follow. Matter fact at times I attract a model, but grown dick, Im a real hard act to swallow. Between the partying, the pills, the pot, the bitches, and double shots, it don't stop

Chorus:
We want shots of Patron, yea, getting it on, Stayin Blown ain't nobody going home. We want shots of the goose, make the ladies get loose. Got respect like bishop in juice. 24/7 we don't go to sleep here. 366, even in the leap year, uh, even in the leap year 366, even in the leap year
