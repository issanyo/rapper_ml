[Hook: Ras Kass]
Kicking back home sipping on that patrone
Gucci swap, gucci belt like get my match on
Hating ass niggas need to get off my dick
And don't be surprised if I call you a bitch
Getting money, have fun, stay heated
Calm down girl you're just a little too conceded
If you pretty with a bad attitude you ain't shit
Don't be surprised when I call you a bitch

[Bridge: Dina Rae]
Buster, wankster , fuck boy, snitch
You cunt , you tramp you make me sick
Buster, wankster , fuck boy, snitch
You cunt , you tramp , you stupid bitch

[Verse 1: Ras Kass]
Ya don't mind me
I'm just seeing double like it's PIP
Hannah Montana she can be my lead
And I don't give a fuck bitch I'm VIP
Here, get it cracking like a relapse
82 I stay bent like knee caps
Reckon labels better raise my pay rate
Cause I connect the chosen people like Jay Jay
I'm what the world excited for
I'm the type to shoot a mom with a silencer
I'm not one for the frontin
Got nothing good to say then don't say nothing

[Pre-Hook: Ras Kass]
And I should be weighing more mature
But I got a way with words
So till that day occurs
I'ma say too short favorite words

[Hook: Ras Kass]
Kicking back home sipping on that patrone

If you pretty with a bad attitude you ain't shit
Don't be surprised when I call you a bitch

Buster, wankster , fuck boy, snitch
You cunt , you tramp you make me sick
Buster, wankster , fuck boy, snitch
You cunt , you tramp , you stupid bitch

[Verse 2: Ras Kass]
Fuck rappers, I throw more stars than a ninja
Promote a nigga watch me do numbers like Avengers
I'm the champ in the top fire contenders
My homies break down the birds with a blender
And we don't fuck with the rats
Niggas who switch gangs and hold the dog back
Jerking off since you came on the scene
Hang in there sport David Carradine
Still let the haters try without me
You clown ass bitch was doing fine without me
Till I hop in the quadron fourth maseratti
Coming home with the face dripping all bukake

[Pre-Hook: Ras Kass]
And I should be weighing more mature
But I got a way with words
So till that day occurs
I'ma say too short favorite words
