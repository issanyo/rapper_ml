(Sound without Focus... is just noise)

[Pro-Verb]
With so much knock in the LBC
It was hard not to claim that DPG
Summertime popped in the L-A-C
With the music courtesy of D-A-Z
And the Soopa, Doopa, Fly for the troopers
Riders, supers, hoes, groupies
All of 'em with the short tight jeans on
"Let's Play House" all of 'em theme song
Word on the gangsta, squad up
Black, brown, throw a St. Ides up
Then the West got harder
And Soopafly hit 'em on the head on Tha Doggfather
Don't nobody party like the West though
G-Funk been the sound since Death Row
Where you think we got the kicked-in clap at?
Time to bring it back, bitch, and it's like that

[Chorus: Latoiya Williams]
Only in L.A. (Only in L.A.)
Where the gangstas play (Where the gangstas play)
Catching up on fame
Summertime in, West Coast ride

[Ras Kass]
I'm about that shit, hoe, gotta get this money
Long Beach, C-R-Son, all the shit is sunny
Put the monkey in it, like the shit is funny
Banana Clip Rassy 'bout to spit this dummy
But funkers told me to kick back
I like revenge, retaliation, and get back, nigga
Got more bars than Kit-Kat
Get smacked like Katt Stacks if you lip jack
A muh'fucker betta recognize
With a flick of my wrist like a Vulcan, you all die
All I do is ball high
Tryna stay above the rim like a tall guy
Dat Nigga Daz, Soopafly, alright
Lexus, [?], left lanes, all ride
OG to BG, I thought I warn ya
Only in California

[Chorus]

[Kendrick Lamar]
Moving down Rosecrans, bumping D-A-Z
Feeling like 1-9-9-3, only one to the 710
I'm in Long Beach, home of Dillinger
Dealing the gangsta shit, gangsta killa
You wankstas quit filling ya iPod up with classics
Ain't a nigga out could match them ad-libs
D-P-G-C General
Gin on my breath while Jennifer hold my genitals
Yeah it's like that cause I was taught that
Back when Dogg Food dropped in the Compton Swap Meet parking lot
Daddy V had three, sold one to my pops
We was popping out, the trunk in the Caddy was rocking out
Slap a nigga in the face with the 808s
Even made Pac salute, snares like a bear trap
They're unbearable too, bare witness
Hits like Barry Bonds, Daz the realest

[Chorus]
