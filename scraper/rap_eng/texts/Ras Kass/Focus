[Verse 1: Ras Kass]
Come up out that shithole, gotta get this money
Long Beach, CR, all this shit is sunny
Put the monkey in it like the shit is funny
Banana clip Ras about to split this dummy
The funk just told me to kick back
I like revenge, retaliation and get back, nigga
Got more bars than Kit-Kat
Get smacked like Kat Stacks if you lift, Jack
A motherfucker better recognize
With a flick of my wrist like Kevorkian, you all die
All I do was ball high
Trying to stay above the rim like a tall guy
That niggas' ass super fly
Y'all ride Lexus, (?), left lane, tall ride
OG to BG, I tried to warn ya
Only in California

[Hook: ProVerb]
Only in L.A, in L.A
In the gangsters' place
Catching up on things
Summertime, let's go ride

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
Rolling down Rosecrans bumping D-A-Z
Feeling like 1-9-9-3 '91 to the seventh jam
I'm in Long Beach, home of dillagent, dilligent gangsta shit
Gangsters killing, you wanksters quit filling your iPod's up with classics
Ainâ€™t a nigga out can out-match them adlibs
DPGC general
Jay know my breath marching, hold all my genitals
Yeah, it's like that cause I was taught that
Back when Dog Food dropped in the Compton swap meet parking lot
Daddy rehab three, so going to my pops we was popping now
The trunk in the caddy was rocking now
Slap a nigga in the face with a little waist, even make 'Pac salute
Snare like a bear trap, they're imperible too
Bear witness
Kids like Barry Bonds, that's the realest, nigga

[Hook]
