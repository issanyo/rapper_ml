[Intro]
"So many homies in the cemetery"

[Scratching]
"Rest in peace"

Celebrate with me, bon voyage
Put your lighters up

[Verse 1]
R.I.P. loved ones that we lost
Celebrate whatever the cost
I pop a case of Grey Goose on the Greyhound
I'm 'bout to land a G6 down in Cape Town
I'm like a broken carousel, I don't play 'round
Fist to the North Star, west, I'm LA bound
Lay down, real niggas stay down when it gets ugly
We be playin' rough in the streets like rugby
Mama used to hug me and tell me that I'm special
Self actualized, now I'm reachin' my threshold
Almost broke my spirit, how much pain can my flesh hold?
Rap got corny, started spittin' bars electro
But thanks to real hip-hop, I'm inspired
And I will not stop, I will fill that spot
Planes, trains and fast cars, hope my wheels don't pop
Money, my, my, my, Jonny Gill on guap

[Scratch Hook]
Rest in peace
So many homies in the cemetery
Rest in peace
Rest in peace
Rest in peace
So many homies in the cemetery
Rest in peace
Rest in peace

[Verse 2]
Life's a journey, not a destination
Success is opportunity plus preparation
My mortality's emancipation proclamation
I'ma live life my way, end of conversation
Fuck you, I'm blacker than crude
Now watch me put the toothpaste right back in the tube
Witness the confidence that I can exude
And watch the calculated asshole when I'm in the mood
That's my family heirloom, slaves to sharecroppin'
Pride for Louisiana's migrating Watts to Carson
Yo, maybe I'm the evolution?
Maybe Ras's target free to execution
Maybe our bloodline's the revolution
A soldier, Doc Holiday, his Tombstone shootin'
God bless the dead, love 'em while they're here
We all disappear but keep me in your heart near and dear
Let's cheer

[Hook]
Rest in peace
So many homies in the cemetery
Rest in peace
Rest in peace
Rest in peace
So many homies in the cemetery
Rest in peace
Rest in peace

[Verse 3]
Rest in peace Eazy-E, rest in peace Biggie
Rest in peace 2Pac, I know y'all can hear me
R.I.P. Punisher and Jam Master Jay
R.I.P. Proof, Eazy-E and Mac Dre
Rest in peace Big L and ODB
Rest in peace J Dilla and Pimp C
Salute Nelson Mandela

[Outro]
Yeah, and we out
Celebrate
Rest in peace Po
