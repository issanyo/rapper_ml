[Verse 1: Voodu]
In the beginning there was darkness
Then God made light and then that came
And soon after that he created the planet
And Voodu was his name
Which means I'm not large, I'm astronomical
A mastermind of murdering men, my slaying style's abominable
Like a snowman no man can withstand
My catastrophic oesophagus, larynx avalanche
From Pakistan to the Himalayas to Mt. Everest
Never rest the walking exorcist
If I was a storm, I'd reign supreme
So check your weather forecast for natural disasters
Extreme when I storm the stage like a one man cyclone
Faced bones crack upon a pack of my rhymes tones
I got it going on
MC's and microphones get torn to bits in my zone

[Verse 2: LMNO]
Once every maroon moon, buffoons flow
Releasing info, that's non-beneficial
One supplement for microphone congestion
Muzzle half-steppers before they learn the lesson
I don't need Fila's to rock a fresh crew
Flesh ain't eternal, hear and now boo
Subjects skipping consistently
Relevance is a key quality
I cock my clock when there's time to kill
You can't avoid getting popped like a pill
Here 'til don't fuck with LMNO
Or I'll send your demo tape to Jerry Heller

[Verse 3: Mean Green]
Two years ago I planted a seed
Now I'm making the microphone bleed
When my vocals are freed, I'm liable to start up a stampede
I roll up weed in the track and blow out feedback
I hold my jewels while I stroll through L.A
And my mind is always on cruise control
I swing facts and dope raps over fat tracks
Melt wax and remain sharp as an axe, bet
I'm like Russian roulette with a tape cassette
Not a vet yet just getting my feet wet
But don't sweat, when I hit it will be all net
My reps unknown, many heads get flown
Can't figure out why it took 'em so long
For them to let me drop my vocals on top of a rap song
Write rhymes strong, so my pockets stay long
Not the counterfeit, my shit hits like a bong

[Verse 4: Ras Kass]
Son I comes clear as fiber optics
So if you hear a pin drop (ping), I'm writing classic nigga
Who wanna take the weight and catch a hernia
I got the fabric of your psyche unraveling
Dolly Madison couldn't create a cupcake with more fillin
Than when the objective is illin instillin, poetic to penicillin
Grillin niggas like Jeffrey Dahmer's Labor Day Picnic
Not E-40 but I get sickwidit, mentally likwit
Ketone steelo: COCH3 COCH3
On a microphone, I'm acetone B
Cause it's kinda dope that most niggas is wack
Claimin to have phat lyrication
But lost all the carbonation, so your style went flat like white bitches backs
Plus your fronts was all silicone implants
Studio rappers with more punches than WBA
Heavyweights saying they can't be served observe

[Verse 5: Key Kool]
Crainum salads must be tossed from the brains of
MC's reposin in the vegetable mind frame
Machines connected to the temples monitoring innovation
In their rhyme minds result in a flat line
Cause wack MC's combust without combustion of
Spontaneous nature the grade card reads C+
Only a bit better than the average, but never above
The up so they get upset so they get upset when five minds connect
In a conglomeration of formulations
Kaleidoscopic manifestations of rhyme manipulations
Broadcasting to the heads like frequency modulations
The stations call letters KOOL
Always coming natural counter-factual
To the artificial so bust da scientifical
Five MC's equal to the eclectic brain shower
E=MC to the fifth power
