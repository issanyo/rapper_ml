[Chorus (Ras Kass)]
What do you want? - I want it all, I wanna ball
I want a million hoes to call
What do you want? - A nine to pop
And 24s so clean, they blind the block (bling!)
What do you want? - Y'all to admit it I'm good
I don't talk it, I live it, I'm hood (Forget it)
What do you want? - Paper to waist
So much paper, Bush wanna take it away

[Scipio]
Yeah, it might sound selfish, but I want a lot
Everything possibly attainable on a block
One shot rifle, revolver Glocks
I'm greedy, gimme what chu got or get shot
I, need about a million dollars to chill
And get ride of these clowns and showcase the real
Show these hoe casing folk'll lace ya grill
Fold ya face, playing in a baking field
I will smash any rapper that talk shit
Clap and leave a cavity the size of my fist
I am no bitch, I'ma let it be known
When I let the baretta go, niggas betta hit the flo' (ah!)
Get the chedda and go, I repo green
Flame spitter, with a deep ol' lean
Got bitches like - "He's so clean!"
Young Scipio ill, plus got a leth-al team
So tell me

[Chorus (Ras Kass)]
What do you want? - I want it all, I wanna ball
I want a million hoes to call (C'mon!)
What do you want? - A nine to pop
And 24s so clean, they blind the block (bling bling)
What do you want? - Y'all to admit it I'm good
I don't talk it, I live it, I'm hood (Forget it)
What do you want? - Paper to waist
So much paper, Bush wanna take it away

[Scipio]
What do you want? - A different chick for every day of the week
They steady bringing me cheese
What do you want? - The same bitches to know
I don't play, I need my dough (hoe!)
What do you want? - My vehicle's thorn
I want Lil Kim to stop rapping and do porn
What do you want? - To spit forever
I'm immortal with the flow when putting this shit together
What do you want? - Nine hundred thou' up front
I want these record labels to know I ain't no punk
I'll tell ya what I want, stop re-making Pac hits
Cos when y'all was beefing, you was quiet as shit (bitch!)
What do you want? - Ya don't really wanna know
Go toe to toe with a pro, that's colder than snow
Colder than the toe of the hoe that's working the track
Y'all niggas don't want it with that, I'll tell ya

[Chorus (Ras Kass)]
What do you want? - I want it all, I wanna ball
I want a million hoes to call (C'mon!)
What do you want? - A nine to pop
And 24s so clean, they blind the block (Scipio!)
What do you want? - Y'all to admit it I'm good
I don't talk it, I live it, I'm hood (Forget it!)
What do you want? - Paper to waist
So much paper, Bush wanna take it away

[Scipio]
I want a house by the lake, my account fulla cakes
Super models that'll kid, be my spouse for the day
Out to get paid, I got a motivated click
Scipio's will let 'em crack the game and get rich
It's about time I get some shit that I want
Like a chick that won't front, and gimme face 'til I'm done
Chill in the slums, post 'til a nigga touch down
And still ride with me doing 80 off Crown (What do you want?)
Gimme a G-S, X-L-P-D-X
On Check Bailey's, and heat with a feet rest
I got homie's that'll pop off a clip
And run up in ya property cos you're proabably a snitch
I want outer towners, to stop rocking our fits
Khakis and chucks like you started this shit
I want y'all to admit that dude is nice
Don't get it mis-con-screwed, I'll do ya wife

[Chorus (Ras Kass)]
What do you want? - I want it all, I wanna ball (yeah, yeah!)
I want a million hoes to call (C'mon!)
What do you want? - A nine to pop
And 24s so clean, they blind the block (Scipio!)
What do you want? - Y'all to admit it I'm good
I don't talk it, I live it, I'm hood (Forget it!)
What do you want? - Paper to waist
So much paper, Bush wanna take it away (Uh huh)
What do you want?

[Ras Kass]
A hun'ed mill, five mic, a five riker ak-rite
I'll settle for five dike
What do you want? - Wrist ice, neck frozen
Good help, I'll do the thing my by god damn self
Ha, you know how we do
Scipio, Ras Kassiano
What do you want? - I want that Re-Up to come up, what? put 'em up
What do you want? - Westcoast, westside, worldwide, nigguh
What do you want? - Yo mama, sucking my dick, haha

What do you want? - Kill the white people!...except Mike
