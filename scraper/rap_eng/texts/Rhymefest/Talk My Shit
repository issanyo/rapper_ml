[Intro: Best Kept Secret]
Chill! Chill!

[Chorus: Best Kept Secret & Rhymefest]
You motherfuckers better learn how to act
Real talk, we just stating the facts
Let me talk my shit
Broke loose, ain’t no holding us back
You want war? You know where it’s at
Let me talk my shit
So get your hands up high, can you feel it? (Can you feel it?)
This is hip-hop, you rocking with the realness (The realness)
You can feel it when we enter in the building (C’mon!)
Swagga on a hundred thousand trillion!

[Verse One: Rhymefest]
It’s that Chicago mindset on deck (Yup)
Zero below, Joe, you get frostbit
Rappers garbage, lose my target when these bars hit
Tell Steve Carell I will come spray up the office
Aww, shit, he’s about to spaz, hit the off-switch
Nah, bitch, First 48, you cowards all slick
He is like a chick flick, cater to them hoes again
I am not the Soulja Boy, I’m the flamethrower, man
Repping for the real niggas, niggas that will kill niggas
Black-on-Black crime’s slavery, we all field niggas
Used to be on J Records, wrote some Kanye records
Next Grammy’s just mine, this is El Che’s record
Jeffrey Manor, street low, T. Hunt, D-dope
If you are the janitor, then you should put your keys up
Hide ‘em all from them boys that’s kicking in the do’
Have you on the floor, only thing that you can say is (Oh!)

[Chorus: Best Kept Secret & Rhymefest]
You motherfuckers better learn how to act
Real talk, we just stating the facts
Let me talk my shit
Broke loose, ain’t no holding us back
You want war? You know where it’s at
Let me talk my shit
So get your hands up high, can you feel it? (Can you feel it?)
This is hip-hop, you rocking with the realness (The realness)
You can feel it when we enter in the building (C’mon!)
Swagga on a hundred thousand trillion!

[Verse Two: Rhymefest]
“‘Fest on some ignorant shit!” I ain’t ignorant
I don’t like that nerd-rap either, I’m not into it
Boy, put some bass in ya voice, you sound intimate
Hip-hop’s supposed to have edge, you so innocent
Wet behind the ears, I make Chucky disappear
I’m respected by my peers and I’m blessed beyond my years
I don’t kiss nobody ass, I don’t pump no nigga gas
And my name ain’t Terrence Howard
I don’t hustle, flow, and crash, I…
Stay grounded, I’m too damn fly
Look at yo pants, why? Froot Loop Toucan fly
Even ‘fore Wale bricked, I tried to pull him to the side
And say, “Them white boys won’t sell yo’ shit”
Uh-oh, what’s the grand total? Willie Bobo
BKS hit me with the go-go, I’m from the Chi!
So they got the white even when the snow blow
Sho’ nuff, I’ma let my soul glow (Oh!)

[Chorus: Best Kept Secret & Rhymefest]
You motherfuckers better learn how to act
Real talk, we just stating the facts
Let me talk my shit
Broke loose, ain’t no holding us back
You want war? You know where it’s at
Let me talk my shit
So get your hands up high, can you feel it? (Can you feel it?)
This is hip-hop, you rocking with the realness (The realness)
You can feel it when we enter in the building (C’mon!)
Swagga on a hundred thousand trillion!
