[Chorus:]
(Some of these days)
I wanna bust some heads
(Some of these days)
I'd rather lie inda bed
(Some of these days)
Im out tryna get love
(Some of these days)
I'm just up in the strip club
(Some of these days)
I feel like crying
(Some of these days)
I feel like dying
(Some of these days)
MAA-N!
(Some of these days)
Woooo, thank you very much now

[Verse 1:]
I wanna spaz out
Throw a brick thru' a sucker ass nigga glasshouse - wit cho'
I know the time comin
Child support gonna bust in and try to find something - but no!
My baby momma just don't understand
I ain't rich bitch it's just an advance - but she know
She better off wit some of these nigs
Whose baby dads don't even care for these kids
I don't kick it wit cowards, this my career you just rap in the shower
You ain't stackin on power, he ain't....??
You ain't ready to ride, get yo' ass out that impala... Holla!
I'm on my grind, be back in an hour
I'm like a bully up in the class, whose waitin for a chance to whopp yo ass, but then again
I used to get cheese, kids said they actin white....???? but then again
Ain't no benefit, 'fest can't not lose coz he get ignorant
I ain't innocent, Jesus walked me to the grammies
Thank you god, now i can sin again

[Chorus]

[Verse 2:]
I feel like puff daddy, coz i ain't vote and I ain't die
I ain't a hypocrit, I don't hate rap music, i just love my shit
Kanye, common and twista, that's it
But then again, i kinda like eminem, he be funny and dissin
I bought his record, it's a one time listen
But man, some of these days Im mo' black and i be ready to blast
Till i see a white girl with a black girl ass
I wanna take that white girl give her a black girl mask
But if i get a dark italian girl, it just might paaaass
I wish i wasn't good at rhyming, coz then my dumbass would go dining
But until that time arrive i won't play thug
Just say hey this is tough love

[Chorus]
