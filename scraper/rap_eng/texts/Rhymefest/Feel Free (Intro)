I see you out there in the congregation this evening
And you're wondering what's wrong
What's wrong with this world that we can't find somebody
That has the true feeling
Everybody's emulating and copying this one and copying that one
Nobody has the fortitude or the brain (?)
To come to honesty
What I'm here to tell you this evening
There's a young man from Chicago, Illinois
That is sure to bring that feeling back
He's been touched and anointed
And if you want to feel this young man
Allow yourselves in the congregation
You sinners, you wonderers
To be free

I want to be free
