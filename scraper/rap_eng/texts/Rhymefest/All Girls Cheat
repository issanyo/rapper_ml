{"And everything's gonna work out fine"}
I don't know man {"Ohhh Lord"} not the way things is lookin
Look, let me tell y'all somethin
Women, they do the same thing that men do man
They cheat, they go out, they wild, they girls goin wild
But they a lil' better at it than we at!
See they plan it out man
And and if you don't understand how the game works
You know what? I think it's time for me to break it down to ya
Let me tell you my story

Now your sister lyin for you when I walk in the house
She like, "Oh you just walked in, she just stepped out!"
What I'm two seconds behind you, take detectives to find you
Let me just, remind you, who the hell you lyin to
Said that you was goin out with Claire
I called Claire (*Hello?*) she was at home, you wasn't there
I'm like ahh hell naw, dawg she wouldn't dare
Dare she did, went to the club, there she is
That's my word, I started thinkin all absurd
I started listenin to Tank like {"Maybe I Deserve"}
Yeah yeah I cheated once, twice, maybe three
But hey, that ain't the point, we ain't talkin 'bout me
Don't change subjects and claim you love 'Fest
When every other day I don't know who you gon' fuck next
I'm thinkin you my girl, my lady, my boo
Tell me admit nothin, we can work this through - psych!

[Hook: Mario] + (Rhymefest)
Are we, really sure (yeah, yeah)
That a love that's lasted for so long can still endure
(Can it still endure?)
Do I, really care (yeah, yeah) la-da-da-da-DAH-DAH-DAH
Hey hey I'm talkin 'bout distractions, goin on elsewhere

[Rhymefest]
Oh you don't think you need game, homey you better have it
Cause women cheat like men, only they better at it
You kiss your girl on the cheek, thinkin she sweet
She got a man to meet at least for every day of the week
Monday - she with Larry, he think he slicker than hair grease
Big daddy with a Caddy and he rockin his hair piece
He like to show off, he's spendin the bucks
But she ain't even gotta fuck him cause he cain't get it up
Tuesday - she with Claude, he on some treat her like a lady shit
Chivalrous, pull the chair out and he's always there to babysit
So - Wednesday and Thursday - she can go out and dance
And if she met me, she probably had a one night stand
Friday - she back wit'chu, kissin and cuddlin
Talkin 'bout her hard week and lookin for love again
Now I ain't tryin to tell you that you wrong for keepin her
All I'm tryin to say is you don't own her, you leasin her

[Hook: Mario] + (Rhymefest)
Are we, really sure (uhh, c'mon)
That a love that's lasted for so long can still endure
(Can it still endure?)
Do I, really care (I don't know) Hey hey hey
I'm talkin 'bout distractions, goin on elsewhere

[Rhymefest]
Look I'mma sing it one mo' time - man, don't get distracted
Your woman cheat like you, only she better at it
She come up with the plan befo'hand, befo' you even ask
"Where was yo' ass?" She tell you where she been and then
Give you a hug, backrub, run the water for the tub
By now, you done forgot she was a thug?
Wait, you need some help stud
Yo' girl wearin perfume and spandex like
I'm goin to the health club with Sheryl
(You know Sheryl!) Yeah you know Sheryl
With two baby daddies, one for her and one for yo' girl
And the whole world knows, but they cain't convince him
That's his baby momma and he's so defensive
She ride around in the Benz and spend them ends up
Took me to the mall, I was so expensive!
I ain't tryin to tell you not to give her your best
But you might wanna still have a paternity test

[Hook: Mario] + (Rhymefest)
Are we, really sure (are we really sure)
That a love that's lasted for so long can still endure
(Can it still endure?)
Do I, really care, hey hey hey
I'm talkin 'bout distractions, goin on elsewhere

[Mario]
Talkin 'bout it goin on elsewhere
Cause there's so many girls, around the world
Goin on elsewhere, goin on elsewhere
Cause there's so many girls, around the world
Goin on elsewhere, goin on elsewhere
Hey hey hey HEYYYY!
