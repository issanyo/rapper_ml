*Over Nice & Smooth's 'Something I Rhyme Slow'

[Chorus] [Rhymefest]:
Sometimes I rhyme slow, sometimes I rhyme quick
Sometimes I rhyme slow, sometimes I rhyme quick

[Verse One] [Rhymefest]:
Sometimes I rhyme slow, sometimes I rhyme quick
Whatever way I chose you'll hop on my {uggh}
You can live poor but I will die rich
You can die tryin', I am 50 Cent
I am Malcolm X so my album's a threat
I am '88 so the outcome is "fresh"
I love it when she get undressed
With a nice soft bath and some all night sex
I feel good
Real good, nice state of mind
Did it in a caddy cause the seats recline
He say, she say they heard it through the grapevine
I just wanna know how it got online
No static, got a sex habit
Too much of anything makes you an addict
Lindsey Lohan, dated a snowman
In the club dancin' with a girl to a slow jam
Poor white girl need an 8 step program
Coke on her face like she ain't got no tan
Did an intervention at the clinic they released her at 10
And now she's sniffing again

[Chorus] [Rhymefest]:
Sometimes I rhyme slow, sometimes I rhyme quick
Sometimes I rhyme slow, sometimes I rhyme quick
Sometimes I rhyme slow, sometimes I rhyme quick
Sometimes I rhyme slow, sometimes I rhyme quick

[Verse Two] [Scram Jones]:
Sometimes I smoke 'dro sometimes I smoke piff
Sometimes I don't smoke but still I don't quit
Roll up that good barney like a Bob Marley
Pass it to 'Fest but he like "awww G"
So instead we get the juicy Advil
Go back up in the lab and I produce a track
Take it down to Sue's I might lose a stack
Put a chick up on my lap cause her booty fat
I fell into her booby trap
Must have been that Patron and that Super Cat
So now she my new bang bus
In the backseat let me play two hand touch
(She's kinky)
Pullin' out two handcuffs
Tried to put it on me, but I don't do that stuff
(Why?)
Cause I know how chicks run pockets
That's not me girl, c'mon stop it
