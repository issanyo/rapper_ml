[Intro]
Um. I want to tell you a story un, about one of my friends that um, kinda wasn't my best friend no more but...I still kinda like her...but...you know...I'm kinda overwhelmed. I can't really express myself nigga! I'm so overwhelmed. Look, it go like this

[Verse One]
I see yellow leaves fallin' in the fall time
And I'm crusin' with the greatest girl of all time
She was so dope it was blowin' my mind
I had to close my eyes and pretend that I was blind cause...
We been homies since back in elementary
And when she talk her boyfriend she never mention me
My breath ain't stink, it wasn't mint for me
You like Barbie she like "Yeah, you like Ken to me."
If I could get another chance
I'd be your first love you would be my last romance
Her daddy taught me how to drive and I crashed his van
But it was all good cause we was fam, damn
If I was dealt another hand
I'd probably tell you how I felt and I wouldn't pretend
But for right now people say "Is that your man?"
She like, "Nah, nah we just friends"
And I'm still singin'

[Verse Two]
She had body like Christina
Attitude Trina
This sister look kinda good like Serena
Celeta or Lauryn Hill, somewhere in that arena
I tried to play it down so I used to call her Xena
She said I looked like Elmo, she called me 'Ugmo'
Then we would play wrestle and baaaow! She caught the elbow
She asked me if I liked her boyfriend, I'm like "Hell no."
(Why not?)
He only trying to get in your pants
Tried to school her to the game so she knew in advance
I would do the same thing if I was given the chance
Truth be told
I kinda hit it once or twice
After the Taste of Chicago on a hot summer night
But you still claimin' virgin, how is that true?
She like, "Nigga it ain't even really count, it's just you."
My guys ask if I would hit it again
I'm like, "Nah dawg, we just friends"
And I'm still singin'
