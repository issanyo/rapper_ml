[Rhymefest]
Yo, I gotta call Juan Carlos
He'll know what to tell me to do man
Gotta stop trippin {*phone rings*}
C'mon pick up, c'mon man

"Bueno?" Yo Juan
"Che" Juan Carlos, whassup man?
{*Juan starts speaking really fast*}
Yo yo yo, yo Jo chill out
Juan, c'mon man, c'mon Juan
You know I don't speak Spanish man
You gotta speak English to me bro
"Bro, you gotta learn Spanish if you gonna work with the people"
I know man, I know but look Juan
I need the quickest way to, oh yeah man
I bumped into a agent on the train
"Bro you can't go to O'hare, you can't go to Midway"
"There's men at my mom's house, they're following"
"You can't even go to Union Station, you gotta find a way out"
Wha-wha-wha what should I do Juan?
I gotta, I gotta get out of here man
"Make, make it to the Canadian" y'knahmtalkinbout?
"Make it to the Canadian border"
"And from there, take a plane to Cuba"
That's not gon' work "Why not?"
You just said it on the phone
"Damn, well if they're listening, porque no lo dices {?}"
You said tell 'em, tell 'em somethin? "Si"
Aight

I hope y'all like dis
It gotta be special for us to act like dis
Gas prices, spy devices
Parking cars under the bridge wearing disguises
SO, none of y'all can know our whereabouts
Revolution was all we cared about
With a cigar from the side of my mouth
I make the whole world shout it, shout it!
El, Che
You tell Castro I'm back so
Bullets in yo' chest give yo' back a back do'
Back to back combat
Fightin in Sierra Maestra jungle
Heat fuckin up my asthma, AHHHH
Tell Death I ain't dyin motherfucker
You missed bitch I ain't cryin motherfucker
Get out my path, I know my way
So fuck the fame, I know my name
I'm, El, Che!
And just so you know
It's a Che all around the globe
It's a Che in the Afghan, Che's in Iran
Che's in Iraq, Che's in Pakistan
Che's in Isreal, yes this is real
Don't think I will not, yes I will kill
Che's in the UK, Che's in Cuba
WAIT~! Carlos, introduce us
"Che estan aqui, they're here, they're here!"
{*gunshots, dial tone, phone clicks*}
