[Chorus][John Mayer]:
I’m writing you to catch you up on places I’ve been
And you have this letter probably got excited
But there’s nothing else inside it

[Verse One] [Rhymefest]
All the places I’ve been, people I’ve seen, women I’ve sinned
Been a long time since I wrote, my friend
They say all good things gotta end
How is that? We fam
We done been through the thin and the thick
Throwing rocks at cop cars when they chase we dipped
See at eight, I had my first bag of weight
And at nine, we was turned to a life of crime
Through it all we was homies
Growth and development
Bangin' on them niggas with they hats turned the wrong way
Then the ghetto life got us involved
With the drugs and the alcohol
Fuck en all
I’m moving out on the first bus – meet me
Said “No, Joe – you go, the hood needs me.”
I don't know how we arrive here but this block man, I ain’t finna die here

[Chorus] [John Mayer]:
I’m writing you to catch you up on places I’ve been
And you have this letter probably got excited
But there’s nothing else inside it

[Rhymefest]
When they told me you died, I was out in Japan
Upset
I never said bye to my friend
Regrets
I felt like I should of went back to the hood to protect you
But I knew it was out of my hands
We come from nowhere
I been to London, Morocco, Cuba, you ain’t even suppose to go there!
We from Chi-town
You never went past downtown
But there’s a whole world past O’hare
Yeah, I’m still rhyming
Your little brother joined the military
He out in Greece on assignment
Even Ty moved down south
We thought he’d be locked up somewhere on solitary confinement
But you can go around the world and back again
Same things happening
Fiends and crack and then
White folks laughin'
At the Blacks and Africans
Till it’s they child
Call up the state now
This is the letter I wrote to all the soldiers that fell
Holding their guns bustin shots for hope
PS. Ask God if he can make some room
Cause El Che is finna come there soon
Until then

[Chorus] [John Mayer]:
I’m writing you to catch you up on places I’ve been
And you have this letter probably got excited
But there’s nothing else inside it
