[Intro]
I want to tell niggas a little bit 'bout...'bout where I come from. We recordin'?

[Verse]
Chicago's like a video game
When your face blow
They want to set up you on extra hard hate mode
Rob you for your jewelry and pesos
Juan to Pedro, you want my ring nigga? Blaow! Take a halo
Fire rice, egg rolls
Guy rode meat for nine whole weeks
Cause all I eat at 35
I'mma die, all that grease
Producers thought that I was vegetarian the way I ate all they beats/beets
I know my time is comin', I ain't finna lie
I might be scared of Jason, but I ain't scared to die
When you see me bumpin' Scarface
Know that My Mind Is Playin' Tricks On Me and I lost faith
I feel like a greyhound in a dog race
If we make it to the manor my nig, we all straight
If you see me runnin' out of the bank, let's all break
Meet me on a 103 we all split cake
If you see me runnin' out of the dope house
That means they prolly sell it to the Feds and Nino Brown got smoked out
And I don't really like to run
But instead of lookin' at fear, you staring down the barrel of a gun
Hop in the ??, hit the pedal with my son
Death is like the devil with a shovel when he come
So I never settle for a little of the crumbs
It's the streets that we run in the ghetto where I'm from nigga

[Hook]
I don't give no flying fuck
Cause niggas finna give up the doe
Run out and buy my shit
If you don't nigga than you'se a bitch
Say it one mo' time
I don't give no flying fuck
Cause niggas finna give up the doe
Chicago you know it's the truth
Cause I got stripes of proof
I'm from ??
