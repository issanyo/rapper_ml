(Intro)
(Brand New) x5

(Hook: Kanye West) x2
I don't like it unless it's (brand new)
You might see me in my (brand new) whip
With my (brand new) bitch, pumpin' my (brand new) shit
You don't like it - get off my (brand new) dick

(Verse: Kanye West)
They say your attitude determines your latitude
I'm high as a motherfucker - fly as a motherfucker
And still the motherfucker you love to hate
But can't - because you love what I make
Now ain't - that about a bitch
And I'ma talk shit until I'm out of hits
They don't want to turn they speakers up they claim I ain't deep enough
All that talkin' I feed off of - keep it up
I'm relaxin' my feet is up - I'm leavin' you haters
Like when Shaq left the Lakers just to "Heat" it up
I state the stats to stunt - I don't need to front
Make black history e'ry day - I don't need a month
The survey says - by the streets according
Kanye's just important as Michael Jordan
Was to the NBA when he was scorin'
Ralph Lauren was borin' before I wore him and..

(Hook: Kanye West)
I don't like it unless it's (brand new)
You might see me in my (brand new) whip
With my (brand new) bitch, pumpin' my (brand new) shit
You don't like it - get off my (brand new) dick

(Hook: Rhymefest)
Yo wait - I don't want it unless it's (brand new)
You might see me in my (brand new) whip
With my (brand new) bitch, pumpin' my (brand new) shit
You don't like it - get off my (brand new) dick

(Verse: Rhymefest)
Now some women hit the mall and some shop at the thrift store
Some of 'em mix and match and make it look like they get more
Some of y'all know you wear a sixteen - squeezin' into a six
Damn - what you make them jeans rip for?
I guess she's lookin' for a brand new man who
Ain't always gotta sit down cause he can't stand you
Boo - this the brand new jam to dance to
While you givin' me "Head" like shampoo - come as you came
Skip the brand name - I won't brand you
What you do here'll stay here like Cancun
Besides your breasts is augmented - I like things authentic
Look at all my whips, they're all vintage
I got a loft with a view of the sea
See I take some more shit and make it new for me
Pimp it out like Xzibit to the (oomph) degree
Why spend and arm and a leg - we can kick it for free you see..

(Hook: Rhymefest) x2
I don't like it unless it's (brand new)
You might see me in my (brand new) whip
With my (brand new) bitch, pumpin' my (brand new) shit
You don't like it - get off my (brand new) dick nigga

(Verse: Rhymefest)
Now Che bustin' and then hit 'em - fuck the cynicism
I'm quick to give y'all niggas constructive criticism
Like "Wait - you basically suck" - his mother said "My son wanna rhyme!"
I'm like "Ma'am - I don't agree with that decision
Nothin' against him - but if he step I got to diss him
I listen to that weak shit - all of it - I can't follow it
(Barf) Excuse me - I'm "whack"tose intolerant
"I worked too hard to get my baby ballin' kid!"
Down the fives - had me blue collar poppin' it
Now I'm in the club - and look who I get it poppin' with
Me and 'Ye go back like crew cuts
He hook me up - as long as I don't ask him for too much
But even he know 'Fest is layin' it down
Cause this is just an old beat he had layin' around!

(Hook: Kanye West)
I don't like it unless it's (brand new)
You might see me in my (brand new) whip
With my (brand new) bitch, pumpin' my (brand new) shit
You don't like it - get off my (brand new) dick

(Hook: Rhymefest) x2
Kanye I don't want it unless it's (brand new)
You might see me in my (brand new) whip
With my (brand new) bitch, pumpin' my (brand new) shit
You don't like it - get off my (brand new) dick homey
