[Intro]
Yo, during the making of this album...a lot of people tried to gauge me on beats and tracks and features. You know who you are. They saw it was an open budget and they thought it was open season on Rhymefest. So I'mma tell you exactly who it is you shouldn't fuck with man. I made my own track. Check it out. Look!

[Verse]
Tell Pharrell "Go to Hell"
Tell Chad he can stay in the pad
Niggas charging an arm and a leg
Makin' me lose my head, I made my own track instead
You over rated ass niggas I can buy my own
Sell two or three tracks, I can buy my home
Man producers ain't cool when you got your deal when
And they send your ass a bill and it's 80 billion
That'll hurt your feelings
I ain't stupid, I gotta recoup that
All you did was chop and loop that
I wrote the rap, how you produce that?
Scott Storch? I ain't feelin' him
I wanna rap and make beats like Eminem
Like I was a black Eminem
"Look at him it's Bleminem!"
Yes, Rhymefest again
So hey Kanye, hey Cool & Dre
I love that track but I can't pay
I'll put something down on layaway
"What the fuck didn't Rhymefest sign to J?"
Hey!
Don't talk about my business in the streets just get them beats
And I won't have to up my piece
And blaow your brains out in them streets
I know this doe is how we eat
But when you cheat man I can't sleep
And I won't make a promise that I can't keep
"Look dawg I'm broke"
"Nah man you cheap"
Well maybe I am but you a scam
So I made my own track nigga, this my jam

[Hook]
Let's ride
If you feel it deep inside
Inside the burning fire
It's like a roller coaster ride
That you wanna ride
On a natural high
Can't keep the
What what? My beat
What? My beat
What? My beat
What? My beat
What? My beat

[Outro]
