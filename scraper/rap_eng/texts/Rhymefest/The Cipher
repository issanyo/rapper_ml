[Intro] [Michael Jackson talking]
Oh boy. What could I sing? Who is it? Ummm

[Rhymefest talking]
Just, just c'mon dude let's do it like this

[MJ] Hee Hee! I just sing it

[Rhymefest] Yeah, c'mon

{Michael starts beat boxing]

[Rhymefest]
Yeah, yeah, look, okay, look
Rhymefest, I got that trouble touch
You get the beat I hop in it like double dutch
Yeah Mike you famous, the crowd is learnin' me
I'm big in the hood but you big in Germany
I take an MC out, make him dead, permanently
Maybe that ain't a word, but it ain't concernin' me
C'mon

[Michael singing]
I gave my money, I gave my time
I gave up everything inside, one heart could find
It doesn't seem to matter and it doesn't seem right
Cause the wheel has brought no fortune still I cry alone at night

Oooowww!

[Rhymefest]
Oooh, that's cold G! Now, see, that's what you call a cypher!
