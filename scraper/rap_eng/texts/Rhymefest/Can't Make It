"You can't get out (wooh!) of the game, no, no..."

"Hey, it's the Best Kept Secret"

[Intro]
El Che is comin'! This the only dedication album ever done ever. You can't duplicate this man! Mark Ronson you ready?
Aight look, look, uh

[Verse]
I think you runnin' outta time... runnin' for your life
Runnin' from the cops like you runnin' from a crime
Check your rear view, yeah who comin' from behind?
I'm, El Che, never runnin' outta lines
Rappers (can't make it) Thinkin' that these fuckin' record deals
Finna change your fuckin' life when you signed? (Nah)
Labels is fallin', whole industry's on decline
It ain't no more dope in the streets, only mine
Only a matter of time before you see the pattern unwind
And I disappear, take that as a sign
Of who's the man behind the mask in front of the shrine
Every revolutionary who defined their time
Like Booker T., Muhammad Ali, Huey P
You and me, yeah nigga I said it, you and me
Either you fight or I'ma pull a Harriet Tubman
And put a shotgun blast to your head until you free
It ain't Pooh or Phonte, Common or Kanye
My name is Rhymefest, El Che, El Carm and Dante
Servin' up the hood like an entr√©e
With over 3000 OutKast without a motherfuckin' Andre, nigga

[Hook: Rhymefest] + (Michael Jackson)
If you keep sellin' dope on the block we (can't make it)
Without education and jobs we (can't make it)
And everybody know what it is homie we livin in the...
All these rappers (can't make it)
That ring tone shit isn't rap, you (can't make it)
I'm bringin' real hip-hop back, you (can't make it)
And everybody know what it is, homie we livin' in the...

[Verse Two]
Yo, yo, I get so loose, I'll turn your brains
Into fresh pro-duce, mixed vegetable, cauliflower tofu
Skip what they told you, runnin' scared, let 'em go (boom!)
Black Jason in the Faust with a gold tooth
Music (can't make it) We went from Marvin Gaye
To Stevie Wonder to Michael Jack to "A Bay Bay"
Now El Che-ay-ay, from LA down to the A-A-A
And I ain't hatin', just clear my way
Late-lay I've been the king of this underground thing
Don't believe me, then jump-jump-jump to get sting'd
Like Killa Bees, I come from a city with killa Gs
Artilleries, bullets will make your ass feel a freeze
If this was Jeopardy, the answer would be me
The question would be "who is hard?", bitch, I leave you scarred
Napoleon Dynamite, you fuckin', retard
(GOSH!) This year 'Fest came so hard
Straight starched, so thirsty, I'm so parched
So dirty yet so clean, my money is washed
I spend everything man, no matter the cost
And I don't need a million men, bitch I'm still gon' march

[Break]
Yeah, this is Rhymefest A.K.A. El Che. And we doin the Michael Jackson dedication album, never been done before
Let's kick it off the right way baby. We livin' in the game homie, c'mon

[Hook]
