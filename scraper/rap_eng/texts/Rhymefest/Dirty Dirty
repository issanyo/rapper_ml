[Ol' Dirty Bastard]
Two steps from the border line
Anything closer will kiss the nine
Think I'm out the game? You out of your mind
Cuz I stay on track, like transit line
Keep it nappy or braided up
Dirty in the cockpit, blazin' up
Stop frontin' when you made it up
Tellin' all my hoes, you can't spray it up
Hah, huggin' nuts like tighty whites
Still trickin' on hoes like Heidi Fleiss
You know why niggas don't give you much respect
Cuz they seen you gettin' slapped with the empty gat
Know Dirt, like bow know death
When I'm huntin' down, birds of rap
Hate Dog, cuz I ate your cat
And you can eat my ass and have a coke with that
Use a spoon, unless you want a fork
Pull my dick out, watch the room get dark
Stay high with the zombie walk
Gotta sit my ass down, like Rosa Parks

[Hook 2X: high pitched female (Ol' Dirty Bastard)]
Dirty Dirty, you tell me how you do it
It look so easy, like there was nothin' to it
But they don't understand, about the Dirty M.C
It's the.... (Ohhhhhhhhhh), new track by ODB

[Rhymefest]
They say dirt and sunshine make the flowers grow
I say, fuck a bitch raw and drive your nut on the floor
Call it what you want, you son of a ho
I was 5 percent til' white bitches came and dropped it down to four
3, 2, 1, I can lick the sun with my tongue
Pull it out and smack a nigga, just for thinkin' I'm done
Shut your trap, razor blade cut your wrap
Fat girls seen me comin', started tuckin' their flab
Rhymefest and Dirt Dog, gon' spark this
The day he got to heaven, track mud on the carpets
Hot like the hot potato, you niggas ain't macho
You hot as gazpacho
Go to the show, for hot dogs and nacho's
This me and Dirt Dog's style, it's not yours

[Chorus 2X}

[Ol' Dirty Bastard]
What can make a ho, look more cuter
Hennessey shots, or smoke more Buddha?

[Rhymefest]
I don't know Dirt, now she look like Zab Judah
Test my manhood, go get my dick ruler

[Ol' Dirty Bastard]
Now you hungry, wanna eat right through her
But you better first track for a noter
Like does she have a best friend, or a daughter
Has she ever tried fuckin' under water

[Rhymefest]
Down down with the fishes, deep sea dishes
I ain't a genie, bitch, I don't respect your wishes
This trick ain't fuckin' me though, god damn
Something very wrong, I don't understand

[Ol' Dirty Bastard]
Misinterpetate, let me break it down
Two pulls make the your merry go round
Touch your toes, show me that rose
Butt naked, in a Wu-Tang pose
Wide open, girl, everything goes
Real freaky, when you powder that nose

[Rhymefest]
Keep it and move, I sleep in the nude
I'm keepin' it rude, pull out my dick and pee in the food
On the way to the stars, don, where's the map?
We fuckin' there, and we gonna fuck back

[Hook 2X]

[Outro: Rhymefest]
Yeah, Dirt Dog, Rhymefest, you want it, man
Rest in peace, I know you heaven right now
Trackin' mud on the carpet, so, we gon' let ya
Do what you do it's the ohhhhhhh
Don't forget the crew, it's the Wuuuuuu
I thought you knew, it's the Ol' Dirt Dog
Rhymefest, yeah yeah, from now to 3000, man
What's rap with Dirty? What's the world without Dirt?
Just a bunch of fuckin' water, ohhhhhhhhh
We out....
