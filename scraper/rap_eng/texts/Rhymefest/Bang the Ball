[Intro]
Yeah you already know what it is man
This for the ballers huh
The real ballers not you fake shit
You know what I'm talkin' about
Let me tell you what's really goin' on in the hood man
Come on

[Verse 1]
I'm out of my mind I'm out of control
I say what I feel I feel like I'm fiddin' to explode
I live in the hood, the ghettos are holes
Watchin' us all with cameras on top of the pole
I'm dealin' with kids, I'm dealin' with bills
I'm dealin' with to [?] rap so I'm dealin' with deals
Bigger don't spoil my Cadillac know that I'm loyal
I'm a drawn out [?] just to [?] fresh from [?] I'm back on the block
Got a purple heart and still can't come up on a job
Back of the court back of the sport
Cross over like aye bangin' the board (yes)
I know that I'm hot 'cause all that I got
Is a wicked ass jump shot I bang the ball

[Chorus]
Yeah you can see it in my soul
When I take 'em to the hole and I dunk like Damon Wall
Uh you can see it in my stride when I fake 'em and I slide
And I dunk like Damon Wall (woo)
I ain't ever in a slump
I ain't never been no punk when I dunk like Damon Wall
Yeah yeah it's all good yeah yeah yeah it's all hood
I bang to ball

[Verse 2]
The women ain't scared the cowards are scared
The hour is here I shine from the sweat in my hair
I'm runnin' the rock I'm racin' the clock
I'm lovin' the game I hate it to stop
Embrace the prophet (yeah)
Don't step on my J's my Nike's are suede
They customly made my foot is on top of your braid (stomp um)
The chief of the hood the head of the hill
The boss of the ball the king of the [?]
I bang to ball

[Chorus]
Yeah you can see it in my soul
When I take 'em to the hole and I dunk like Damon Wall
Uh you can see it in my stride when I fake 'em and I slide
And I dunk like Damon Wall (woo)
I ain't ever in a slump
I ain't never been no punk when I dunk like Damon Wall
Yeah yeah it's all good yeah yeah yeah it's all hood
I bang to ball

Yeah yeah yeah
Okay

[Verse 3]
What is you said my people is trained
Makes your game come down on your ankle it's sprained
Hit by the train you shouldn't have been inside of my lane
My train of thought teamwork runnin' the train (woo)
A locomotive we just a local with motive
We ain't internationally noted we grab a rock and we hold it
Yeah this for the hood, this for the world the sport
Homie this is not for the court
We bang to ball

[Chorus]
Yeah you can see it in my soul
When I take 'em to the hole and I dunk like Damon Wall
Uh you can see it in my stride when I fake 'em and I slide
And I dunk like Damon Wall (woo)
I ain't ever in a slump
I ain't never been no punk when I dunk like Damon Wall
Yeah yeah it's all good yeah yeah yeah it's all hood
I bang to ball
