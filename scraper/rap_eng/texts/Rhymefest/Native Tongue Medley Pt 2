Pure breed MC straight from Chi
I'm from the

Gangstas, hustlas, pimps that ride

Take my girl out for a good ass time

Back to the crib, it's the place I reside
On the
(Southside, southside, southside, southside)

Educated man, from the windy land
Yeah, they call me a star cause that's what I am

Back before Chicago was a music town
With multi-platinum artists just walkin' around
I was walkin' around
I was layin' it down
I was battlin' Juice he was the king of the town
Then I took it to heart, put my heart on my sleeve
And I met Kanye that's when I start to believe
We could make it out the city if we start to believe
It was bigger than him, way bigger than me
Man, you gotta be delusional just to dream
When they say you crazy that's a good thing
They don't understand your plight your struggle
Your fight your grind to the top to sing
Face the crowd, make me proud
Not tomorrow this the power of now
They said my second album wouldn't even come out
El Che' mothafucka, here take it and bow
