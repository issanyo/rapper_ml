"The door is closing"

[Rhymefest]
Yeah man

Got my passport, my intinerary, it's about to be on

"Jefferson Park is next"
"Doors open on the left, at Jefferson Park"

(You got a trip planned? Where you goin Che?)

And how you know my name, fool? I don't know you
(Ready to talk to us?)
Am I ready to talk to you?

Listen man, I'ma get on this plane
And when I'm outta here, ain't nuttin y'all can do about it
And HELL NAW I ain't talkin to you~!
Whatever book you got open, you might as well shut it
I'M OUT~!
(Alright see you at your next stop Che)

{*breathing hard*} I think I lost him
Aight look, this is revolution
The new era, of freedom fighters
Most governments call terror
I live by the gun, they march and write letters
Born in Argentina, Ernesto Guevera
Some people knew him as El Commandente
Mexicans said, "Che mucho mucho hombre!"
Enemies knew I was good with the gunplay
But today, I'm, I'm, El, Che!
Yeah, that's my name
Communist shit's all the same
We was born in the hood where we stood slingin lots of 'caine
In the drought ask God for rain
What it's 'bout when you fin' to lose your house and yo' spouse and say
You diggin in the couch for change
You wanna blow out your brains, everybody need a hero
What's my name, what's my name?
I'm El, Che...
