[Sample]:
"I can't help it, but I"

[Verse One] [Rhymefest]:
I love my life, love my wealth
Love the fam (uh huh), I love myself
I go to war put the love on the shelf
It's the champ baby give him the belt
Let me dance around with it like Cassius
Foot in they asses
Never had a father so my flow is a bastard
Never had a flop, Blue Collar's a classic
Bitches just ain't grasp it
I walk through the hood like Moses with a gun and a tablet
Givin' nigga commandments and givin' 'em caskets
Givin' chicks the business, my dick is magic
(Wow!)
That's what's happenin'
I'm the captain
Plus he's snappin'
This is q real life, youse the has been
I'm in fashion, young and dashin'
God damn I'm fine
"I can't help it, but I"

[Hook] [Rhymefest]:
I can't help myself
Uh, just started workin' out gotta holla at hoes
(AYE!)
I can't help myself

[Twone Gabz]:
My rents three months late, I went and bought some clothes
(AYE!)

[Rhymefest]:
I can't help myself
You know I just got paid, finna hit the club cause
I can't help myself
Can't help myself
Can't
"I can't help it, but I"

[Verse Two] [Twone Gabz]:
Girl, we could party in good taste
And you a Christian girl, give me some sex and good faith
Slim waist and cute face
Use protection, I examine the pussy, to me it looks safe
I'm just playin', I don't go that far though
Her coochie kinda loosey/Luci, I ain't Ricky Ricardo
Escargo, my car go, 160, swiftly on Lake Shore in Chicago
Do it to the fullest, crack open a bottle
Mixin' light and dark like some kind of retardo
I'm callin' off tomorrow
Like, "Boss, this Twone Gabz, KISS MY ASS!
And if I'm fired, just send my cash."
I partied last night like it's my last
And I live my future like it's my past
Ate good, hit the club, got pussy and crashed out

[Hook] [Rhymefest]:
I can't help myself
My baby momma keep trippin' on child support
(AYE!)
I can't help myself
I still hit it now and then, this one for the road
(AYE!)
I can't help myself

[Twone Gabz]:
I got a big box Chevy and the rims is cold
(AYE!)

[Rhymefest]:
I can't help myself
Can't help myself
Can't
"I can't help it, but I"

[Twone Gabz talking]:
Man 'Fest, this your song man. You hear how they snappin' for you? Man they want you to give 'em some mo'. Give 'em the grand finale. Wrap it up for 'em

[Verse Three] [Rhymefest]:
Alright, look
You got a deadbeat dad and a part time dad and child support dad that's a father?
When the deadbeat dad, he don't really come around
And the part time, he don't even bother
Now the child support dad never visit cause he mad
But he feel a little bad so he send a little cash
Little shorty cryin' cause he wonder where his dad
But he couldn't really wish got what he never really had
Now all three of these kids have the same momma
But all three of these dudes got a different drama
Child support dad is pissed
He givin' all his money to this chick while deadbeat don't do shit
So he sent goons to stomp him out
Deadbeat got mad as hell, found part time and chumped him out
Now all three daddy's can't believe
They baby momma ran away with me
Haha

[Hook] [Rhymefest]:
I can't help myself
When the rents overdue but still look fly
(AYE!)
I can't help myself
The rims on the old school cost more than the ride
(AYE!)
I can't help myself
You know I'm faithful to my chick and the one on the side
