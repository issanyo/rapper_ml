I think I'm ready to do some type of report
Tell me whatcha really want
Look at how lovely (Mark Ron)
What they don't know (Rhymefest) it's bout to get ugly
From the East to the Midwest
Lemme tell ya how we do it here
(It's 'bout to get ugly)

You know we shot till I die
And I'm lovin' the spot
But when I'm up in NY they say the clubbin is hot
They say
You could meet a broad
Take her home on the spot
And that broad could get a broad
Bring 'em home and just watch (Yes!)
They say Club Cheeta'
That's the place where all the niggas gettin' shot in the face
We can hit central fly
Long as the chicks is fly
I need some head no time to waaaaaste
Who that DJ be
They said Ronson
Step in the club with one hand on mah Johnson
That Midwest attitude gettin' 'em respondin"
Talkin bout "Ohh his accent is so charmin'"
Yeah, you wanna dance chick lets go
Glowsticks, lollipops, right foot, left toe
Looked around the room
I ain't see no Negroes
Like ahhh "niggas don't listen to techno"
Slow it down now, we goin downstairs
They got the Cristal
They got the lounge chairs
With the pretty Puerto Rican girls around here (hey baby)
I know its everyday for you
I ain't from round here

Tell me whatcha really want, look at how lovely
What they don't know it's bout to get ugly
What they don't know it's bout to get ugly
Right now it's gonna get ugly
Tell me whatcha really want, look at how lovely
What they don't know it's bout to get ugly
Tell ya right now it's bout to get ugly
Right now [?most thinkin' it's lovely]

I'm dancin with this chick, right?
Music hard got her ass jumpin all night
DJ throwin' out [?the pity part] that's right (No shirt on)
Hey playa what that is, the White Stripes? (oooohhhh)
Hold up
Where the hell he get that mix
White boys goin' wild doin back flips
Playin rock n' roll
Mixin' with the black shit
M.O.P AC/DC
That's it! Keep it goin'
Now its Rob Zombie
I never liked rock n' roll
But now its gon' be
Blonde hair blue eyes
Kissin gold chains
I'm Mos Def
She the queen of the stone age
Rhymefest
I'm the king of my own age
Get your motor running
Head out on the highway
The way this DJ like the start to the stop shit
Should we dance?
Hell nah, start a mosh pit
And let 'em know we just
Tell me whatcha really want, look at how lovely
What they don't know it's bout to get ugly
What they don't know it's bout to get ugly
Right now it's gonna get ugly
Tell me whatcha really want, look at how lovely
What they don't know it's bout to get ugly
Tell ya right now it's bout to get ugly
Right now it's gonna get ugly
Tell me whatcha really want
For me to miss my plane
Stay in NY and do it again
Tell me whatcha really want
Rock stars, electric guitars
Baby who's pullin' your strings
Tell me whatcha really want
The DJ in the booth
Thinking that we not playin the truth
With the hard rock, hip-hop
East to Midwest
Mark Ronson's on the cut
And my name is Rhymefest

(Right now it's getting pretty ugly)
(Riiiiight now,)
(Doin' it again, Doin' it again, Doin' it again, Doin' it again now
(Going to get ugly right now,)
(I can't, I can't help myselfâ€¦)
