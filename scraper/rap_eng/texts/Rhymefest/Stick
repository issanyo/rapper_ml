Woo! Yeah...
Ladies and gentlemen, what you are about to hear
Is another, Rhymfest, Animal House classic
So get on the flo' and just

(Back it up, back it up) Now put it on my stick
(Back it up, back it up) Now put it on my stick
{Back it up, back it up} Now put it on my stick
{Back it up, back it up}

Now Columbus discovered America (yeah)
And look, and I just found me some Erika (hi!)
Back it up, put it all in this area (ooh)
You send the vibe like a messager carrier
And wait - I just got off of work and all
And I ain't think I'd meet a chick that could work it all
Move in, you ain't gotta go work at all
Now first of all, I ain't thirsty y'all
I just wanna sit-sit and drink wit'chu
And then get you tip-tip, tipsy too
Forget myself then I start pah-payin you
Girl you know that ain't true, I'm just playin wit'chu
C'mon, now I ain't fin' to get soft or trick off
Blindfold yourself, spin around and get lost
I put my dick all around your mouth like lip gloss
Girl you better "Jump" like Kris-Kross before I make ya

Put it on my stick, put it, put, put it on my stick
Put it on my stick, put it, put, put it on my stick
{Back it up, back it up} Put it on my stick
Put it, put, put it on my stick
{Back it up, back it up} And put it on my stick
{Back it up, back it up} And put it on my stick

Now Ben Franklin found 'lectricity
And it's electric when you be kissin me (muah!)
Let me take you on a ride through history
Before the fame and her ass was dissin me
But ho! .. Don't get up and leave
This the part of the show you won't believe
David Blaine gon' complain when he see me
On BET, and MTV
And girrrrrrrrrl, skip the entourage
It's a two-seater Porsche in my garage
I'mma take you out the hood like bon voyage!
Introduce you to stars and it ain't no mirage
My radio, believe me I like it loud
I be outside of the club and movin the crowd
Then I get her to the crib to remove the blouse
Look baby no mistakes allowed, you better turn around and oooh

Farrakhan just marched with a million men
But I got a million dollars in fives and tens
Back it up on my lap, I'm ready to spend
Put it all on the table I'm ready to win
Woo! Woo~! .. Now you ready to bend?
And she sayin that it hurt but I barely was in
Livin life carefree is still like a sin
God let me start over, and do it again
Like OHHH-OHHHH, OHHH-OHHHH
These hoes is on the flo'! Work it out
OHHH-OHHHH, OHHH-OHHHH
These hoes is on the flo'! You need to back it up and
