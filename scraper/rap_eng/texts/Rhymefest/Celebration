It's so amazing
How life changes
Doing what you love
Let's celebrate, Special occasions
That no one's promised of
I spend my dues
I'm living proof
That nothing stays the same
Got to stay true until I'm through
This may not come again

[Verse 1: Rhymefest]
How you feeling?
I woke up this monrning, feeling great
Get to enjoy this day that god made
A classic
?
?
I want my 3 P's: Paper, Pussy, and Passion
I'm like a broke street light, boy I'm flashing
Got to hit the lake, crack open the Hennessy
Today, we ain't giving haters no energy
No beef, no B.M. drama
Little kids say "see him mama, he's cool"
Let the top down, we can ride round chi town
Everybody fixing to act a fool
Graduation, Celebration
You just got married? Congratulations
This is a jam for any special occasion
You know how it feels? Amazing

[Verse 2: Rhymefest]
What's the one time of your life you wanna visit?
Not to change nothing, just to re-live it
Just to feel it, the first time you ever made love
Your first car, your girl's first hug
If you had a time machine, would you use it at all?
Or live in the present, or go to the future and ball?
Live is a blessing, and hopefully you won't fall
Family and friends are rare, but good for us all
The chosen few ?
The summer, the fun we be feeling it
The woman, or weed we get higher than helium
I touch people with words, That's why they fe
They say the black man's life span
Is sixty-five
You have then, let's get it in, while we alive
Gloria Gaynor, I tell them haters "I Will Survive"

[Outro: El]
A special occasion
If you're doing what you love
No one is brown man's dust tomorrow
No one, No one
