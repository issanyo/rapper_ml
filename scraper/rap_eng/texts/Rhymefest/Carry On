[Verse 1: K21]
My luggage packed a little hollow
It’s for travel funds I begged for, stolen or borrowed
Last day of my journey and I’m unsure what follows
But I ain’t fallin' asleep because I’m going home tomorrow
And I’d love to stay forever and a day
But I gotta pack it up and get on the next plane
And I learn a lot from wherever I stay
But no one ever really seems to get it when I say
That Adelaide is my very own
Home, cult city with the churches where I roam
A place that you might never go, but fall in love
If you get to know it enough, so allow me to set the tone
State of the festivals, when it’s burning up here
'Cause you ain't had a summer this hot till you come near
Home of some of the best beaches that you’ll ever see
The same shores that they used to turn away the refugees
Spread knowledge but a little love is all that we need to grow
Epidemic with ice and most of us ain't seen the snow
Still I carry on moving with what I need to know
I love this city but once in a while you need to go and

[Chorus: Rhymefest]
Pack a couple things in your carry on
Not too much, it's just to carry on
Lemme take you to a place that I call home
We could spend a couple days 'fore we carry on
Pack a couple things in the carry on
Not too much, it's just to carry on
Lemme take you to a place that I call home
We could spend a couple days 'fore we carry on
Carry on, carry on
Carry on and on and on
Carry on, carry on
Carry on, on and on

[Verse 2: Rhymefest]
Chicago, that’s my very own
Ho cops shoot kids and they carry on
We gon' burn this bitch down like [?]
P.E., "Welcome to the Terrordome"
The Windy City is a tale of two sides
Somewhere in the middle, the truth resides
Out west you can see the poverty in they eyes
Down south you can smell the gun smoke in the skies
Up north is a disguise, the party is live
You almost forgot this is where [?]
Got assassinated in his own sheets
Then a black roses grew from the concrete
Born in Hawaii but developed 'round my street
The first black president lived around me
Yeah, I pack the carry on, get the [?]
I got a spot on the lake we could get married on
The best food in the world, there’s no comparison
I welcome you to my own lil scary home
Now unpack [?] come on

[Outro: Rhymefest]
Carry on, carry on
Carry on and on and on
Carry on, carry on
Carry on, on and on
Carry on, carry on
Carry on and on and on
Carry on, carry on
Carry on, on and on
