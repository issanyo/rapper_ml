[Sample]:
"Do it again"

[Verse One]:
Let me tell you about the story of mine
80 Grand my advance, put my name on the line
I was young and hot, I was ready for a spot
Next Kanye and Common, 'Fest and Mark Ronson
Press was respondin'
Critically acclaimed, he like a mix between street and conscious
With humor, charisma, fresh for the listeners
We dropped Brand New then gave it to the mixers
Some played it, some of y'all didn't
Give it to B.E.T., they ain't did nothin' with it
Went up to MTV, they said, "Dawg it ain't hittin'"
Went back up to the label they said, "Fest you bullshittin'"
Even though I had a hot ass album?!
A lot of y'all didn't know nothin' about him
No tears cause it's clear, what they fear in the mirror
Man Mark disappeared, now I'm all that's left here
Man FUCK IT
This is life and I live it so I love it
If I fall I get up, dust it off and keep truckin'
I ain't mad at nobody, I don't blame y'all for nothin'
The other day Clive called he's goin' open the budget

[Chorus]:
And I'mma do it again
I'mma do it again
I ain't holdin' nothin' back I'mma do it again
I'mma "do it again"
I'mma "do it again"
I'mma "do it again"
And I ain't scared of nobody, I'mma do it again
Get ready for El Che, we gon' do it again
I'mma "do it again"
I'mma "do it again"
I'mma "do it again"

[Verse Two]:
It was A Tribe Called Quest tour, the time of my life
The whole crew was there, Q-Tip, Jarobi and Phife
We was rippin' it every night
Givin' fans they fill
But the only feeling I had, this can't be real
Imagine, on the road with a group you grew up with
They got your back and even tryin' to help you blow up quick
I know God is real cause he answered my prayers
One reviewer even said my show was better than theirs
I called my mom and told her about it
We might even get some extra paid shows up out it
I might even start actin' and get some roles up out it
Loud as hell at the airport, I was bold about it
To my surprise, the next day on the phone
Q-Tip was mad as hell sayin' I had to go home
He accused me of dissin' him
Said I shouldn't mention him
When I was at the airport his guy was listenin'
Right behind me, grimy, the drama
It didn't even matter I was talkin' to my momma
The only thing I could do was just throw up my hands
Apologize and ask Tip for a chance
C'mon man

[Chorus]:
Let me do it again
Let me do it again
Let me out on the stage, I'll do it again
I'mma "do it again"
I'mma "do it again"
I'mma "do it again"
Look, and I don't care what they say, I'mma do it again
Get ready for El Che, he gon' do it again
I'mma "do it again"
I'mma "do it again"
I'mma "do it again"
