[Hook] {X4}
I'm the dirtiest nigga
You the lulliest slut
The alcohol in my liver make me rub on her butt

[Verse One]
It goes hippa to the hoppa and you just don't stoppa
Peace to Big L, Big Pun and Big Poppa
Jam Master Jay, down to 2Pac ah
Lisp watch your lips, spit your shit proper
Yeah, I beat the odds
Your Honor trying to put me away, I beat the charge
Callin' all cars, Ol' Dirty and Fest at large
Fuck cash, I got bitches with Visa cards
I'm a monster
You can't fit in my genre
More guns than Contra like how I'm gon' conquer
The King Kong of sing song
Bitch sing 'long
C'mon
C'mon
C'mon
I'm the dirtiest nigga
You the lulliest slut
The alcohol in my liver make me rub on her butt
Ain't no nigga that be bigger than us
And when I lift your skirt up
It's like "God damn, that's your butt!"
Yeah
I ain't show my ass, I just mooned 'em
And Michael ain't touch the kids he just spooned 'em
Mark Ronson picked me up and got me groomed
But I'm 'bout to get dirty climbing into your room
