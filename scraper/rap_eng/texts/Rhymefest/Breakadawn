[Rhymefest]
This Rhymefest right here...
On the Michael Jackson dedication album, yaknahmsayin?
Get ready for the new album, "El Che"
In stores, in spring or summer
Or whenever J Records get, that thing together
Heh, look...
We gon' do a lil' somethin like this though
We gon' sit back and relax
Uh, to the old school trax! Uh...

Do you remember your first love?
The first time you ever got your girl's first hug?
It's a lot of things in life to be the first of
As far as rap goes, this year I be the first up
But Michael Jackson was the first to sell fifty mil
Seven number ones on one album is pretty ill
I was the first to get a Grammy for my record out
And sell a hundred-somethin thousand off of word of mouth
But Michael Jackson was the first to Moonwalk on Earth
And buy a Beatles catalog, imagine what that's worth
I was the first rapper to ever fly on British Air
And meet with members of Parliament on Hip Hop Affairs
Then Michael SNAPPED when he got knighted by the Queen
Okay, Mike, this time you win, keep doin your thing
To the!

[Chorus: original De La Soul chorus, Rhymefest]
"Breakadawn.. breakadawn.."				Yeah, yeah, to the	
Ah one two, ah one two
"Breakadawn.. breakadawn.."				To the sun come up	
Ah one two, ah one two				To the sun come up
"Breakadawn.. breakadawn.."				To the moon come down	
Ah one two, ah one two				Just messin around
"Breakadawn.. breakadawn.."				To the... yeah, yeah, yeah	
Ah one two, ah one two				Merriweather c'mon! Where you at?

I can't help it, noooo...				Alpha Live, one time!

You shoulda seen me in the roots, speakin of birthplace
And thanks to my moms, "Off The Wall" was my first tape
Now, I think I'm "Bad" in the leather and good jeans
But, as a shortie "Thriller" gave us bad dreams
From imitating moves to singin to "Billie Jean"
To getting older and experience what it means
And I remember watchin Moonwalkin' so many times
To get the "Smooth Criminal" lean, I broke the rewind
Word, and now we back to Beat Jacks and Hi-Tops
And Michael stood on his toes like, loafers and white socks
And anybody "Black or White" can name songs
Cause we still wanna rock with you...

[Chorus: original De La Soul chorus, Rhymefest]
"Breakadawn.. breakadawn.."				To the breakadawn
	Ah one two, ah one two				To the breakadawn
"Breakadawn.. breakadawn.."				Till the sun go up!
	Ah one two, ah one two				And the moon go down
"Breakadawn.. breakadawn.."				I'm just messin around	
Ah one two, ah one two				With that Michael sound
"Breakadawn.. breakadawn.."				To the, yeah, yeah, to the
	Ah one two, ah one two				Dane Merriweather WHAT?!
