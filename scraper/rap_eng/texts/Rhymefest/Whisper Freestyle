[Verse]
I know you tired of these same lame niggas tryin' to holla
In the strip club only tip ya a dollar
And he steady tryin' to act like he baller convention
That little shit don't even buy you extensions
Smack you on the ass tryin' to get your attention
You should turn around girl and smack his ass back
Booty like a horse, I'mma have to saddle that
Climb on top and straddle that
But I'm from the hood and you know we like to ride Cadillacs
Climb in back and relax
I'mma play the principle, pull your pants down and paddle that
Tattle tale, tattle tale, run and tattle that
And while you at it, don't forget to remember
That my Blue Collar album drop in September
Wait, I ain't really good at the whispers
But all these wack niggas is fearin' it

Wait to you hear my shit
Wait to you hear my shit, September
Wait to you hear my shit, Blue Collar
Wait to you hear my shit
