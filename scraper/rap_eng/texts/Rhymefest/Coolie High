[Sample]:
"Meet me in paradise. Now is the time"

[Verse]:
I keep that Frank Lou bubbly on, Mr. Don Juan
Straighten your tie, shine your shoes, manicure nails
Third rail shock, electrify crowds standin' 'round
Anticipatin' the Super Fly sound
Curtis Mayfield, Freddie's dead, overdose over the ledge
Held his heart and made a pledge I will never die scared
See, if you want somethin', just be still
Fear is false emotions that appear to be real
Don't get your panties in a bunch
You can always count on 'Fest in a crunch (time)
I used to love school, dropped out of that shit too
When I took the shorty money in the lunch (line)
That's when I knew that there was money on the block
Call me stupid but this dummy had some money in his sock
Big rocks, picture them Birds, Alfred Hitchcock
You know how it end, you bound to get shot
But them the choices that we got to make
Either poor all your life or be king for a day

[Chorus] [Camp Lo]:
You need to come inside and check Lo
Relax yourself and let the sugar Lo flow
Coolie High got you wide
You need to come inside and check Lo
Relax yourself and let the sugar Lo flow
Coolie High keeps you wide
You need to come inside and check Lo
Relax yourself and let the sugar Lo flow
Coolie High got you wide
You need to come inside and check Lo
Relax yourself and let the sugar Lo flow
