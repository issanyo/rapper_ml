[Intro]
Even the black folk who got big money, they still fraid-afraid
They still scared. So they become well adjusted to in-injustice
So they walk around almost like peacocks
Look at me, look at me, my achievements and so forth
And you can hear Curtis Mayfield saying
"Peacocks strut because they can't fly."
Nobody wanna be an eagle. Why? Cause they shoot eagles

[Rhymefest talking]
Behold, the cry of the ghetto is coming for them
And I have seen the oppression and heard their cries
Thus the voice came to me and said, "I am, who I am."
And I have sinned to set my people free

[Verse One]
What's the closest you ever been to death?
You ever let your soul levitate over your body to watch you rest?
Or put a gun to your head so you can play Roullette?
Or take a whole bottle of pills till you felt no stress?
What's the closest you ever been to life?
You ever got a felony charge because the whole jury is white?
Or seen a child, born on crack, cry through the night?
The only bottle that he want is the pipe
Man, what's the closest you ever been to being rich, Aspen ski trips?
This is the Mafia, how many chicks you want Three 6?
Bottles floatin' around the club, the club is sea sick
You feelin' like the pharaohs in Egypt
Feelin' like men
Feelin' like Ken
Feelin' like the Hurricane Katrina shit will never ever happen again
Feelin' like you travelin' home

[Rhymefest talking]
Let's all turn to Exodus. 5-1

[Verse Two]
What's the closest you ever been to your family?
Your pops locked up, your mama beat you, now you live with your granny
Your streets are closer to you then your uncle or auntie
Fuck school, it's time for plan B
You know what that is
Holdin' the heat
Lettin' it squirt
Puttin' in work
Tryin' to find a Heaven on Earth
I pray to God and the Devil in church
I'mma worship whoever help me first
Folks
What's you know 'bout trust?
You ever got locked up and had the prosecutor say, "You in luck
Tell us, who gave you the dope? Who gave you the pistol
Who told you to shoot it?"
Think smart, and your sentence is cut
Yeah, that's the same shit that set Fred Hampton up
And that's the reason them crackers got the clamps in us
Sell dope little nigga, rap, dance for us
I saw the cops beat a shorty when his hands was cuffed
Ohh
What you know 'bout honor?
What you know 'bout fear?
What you know 'bout the power of the subconscious mind and that's why I'm here
I'm a mountain man
You can't move me
Calm or cool me
I keep a tool right where the jewels be
And keep my money right were the Jews be
I keep the pen next to the loose leaf
With the Koran next to uzi
Ohhh
What's the closest you ever been to revenge?
What's the closest you ever been to your friends?
Nigga what's the closest you ever been to bein' broke, gettin' evicted again?
Charlie, what's the closest you been to sin?
Man, what's the closest you been to havin' a chain flooded with ice?
This is Vegas so bet your life
And if, and if
You never been through none of this in your life
What's the closest you ever been to Christ?
