Yeah, I aim to spit, and maim your clique
I bang your bitch, bitch I'm dangerous
Down I came to get, up to claim my shit
Raw like 'caine and gettin brain from brainless chicks
It's, yo', party - dowutchyalike
Dis, my, mission - gon' fuck tonight
Up in the club and like see what the buzz is like
Niggas who pop shit gon' feel what crutches like
The slugs is like; I keep the whole hood fiendin
I don't smoke but I know what drugs they like
I'm the man to see, livin the fantasy
Pocket full of Stones like Sly and the Family
Lift your shirt girl, show me the mammaries
Next week I'll still have good memories
All, I, Do, the clique with me
Sign the check nigga don't say shit to me
This is history; what rapper you know
Before his record drop is a Grammy winner G?

Bounce from town to town, 'Fest gon' put shit (down)

This my town dawg, watch what tone you get
This Windy City nigga, don't get blown to bits
Archaeologist nigga I stay with a bone to pick
Goin tit for tat, black aristocrat
Born with a gift to mack anywhere chicks is at
Malaysians, Haitians, Asians mixed with black
Bring 'em back to the block like yeah nigga, get with that
Fuck raisin the bar, man I MADE the bar
Went to Harvard Law like Cochran, I aced the bar
Just in case I get faced with a case tomorrow
Look in my face and they race to get Che disbarred
Nah I'm chillin baby, now make it poke child
With meditate I help you bring your inner ho out
We'll regulate and get it crackin like a coke house
Pretty panties with some fanny I'mma make her go (down)
