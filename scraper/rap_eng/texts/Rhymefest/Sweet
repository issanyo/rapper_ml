Power moves, yo
El Che, Motorcycle Diaries
Let me show you how I'm coming
I don't like it unless it's brand new
You might catch me in my brand new whip
With a fifth, take a sip
Drink and drive, we can Tokyo Drift
Passing through city hall yelling "fuck politics"
How the fuck is it a black vote when don't nobody black vote
Neighborhood fucked up since we got off that black boat
Burnt down, burnt up, all you see is the black smoke
Obama must be a stone, cause he ain't really black, folks
My pipe dreams turned into crack hopes
Everybody's high blown when they start to tax dope
You ride Chevys on 30s and like to stand out
Uncle Sam taxing for every gram you hand out
So how that coke in the pot supposed to pan out
When if you don't pay, they take everything in the damn house
I could talk about how fresh I am
Ghetto Black Eyed Peas, you could call me Yes.I.Am
Add up all the other rappers and they less than him
He's underground and underrated, well I guess I am
I hate when niggas say they overstand
Acting like they know the plan when they just devoted fans
Chi-town, frozen land, hit you with the cold shoulder
Smack you with the frozen hand
Turned around, it steel on you with it closed again
Like Rick James when he saw doctors closing in
I'ma run for alderman, "There he goes again"
