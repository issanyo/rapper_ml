[Intro]
Do you wanna take it higher? (Higher!)
Do you wanna take it higher? (Higher!)
Do you wanna take it higher? (Higher!)
Do you wanna take it higher? (Higher!)
Do you wanna take it higher? (I said higher!)
Higher! (Higher!)

[Chorus]
Right now! (Higher!) Higher! (Higher!)
Right now! (Higher!) Higher! (Higher!)
Higher! (Higher!) Higher! (Higher!)
Take it higher, people!

[Verse One: Rhymefest]
When I do my thing, the crowd goes nuts
Rappers hate, the media says, “What—
Kind of music is that for him to rap?”
Pro-black, no crack, El Che is back, I
Kill it, hot like skillet
Chuck D with muscles, here, baby, feel it
Jaguar Paw, I fight for my village
Hands up high, you see how we feel it, uh
Touch that, rub that, love that
I’m 24s, your boyfriend’s a hubcap
(Knock ‘em out, ‘Fest) This ain’t love taps
It’s 21 questions, but this ain’t love raps
It’s more like sweat-and-blood raps
Six feet below, but I rise above that
From dirt to light, back to the fire
Let me hear it from the choir, I’ma go

[Chorus]
Right now! (Higher!) Higher! (Higher!)
Right now! (Higher!) Higher! (Higher!)
Higher! (Higher!) Higher! (Higher!)
Take it higher, people!

[Verse Two: Rhymefest]
Come, get some, son of a bitch
Made a half-mil and I still ain’t switch
Didn’t sell records and I still ain’t quit
Kill dogs like Vick, cool like fix [?]
Moulin Rouge, y’all do’s like this
Voodoo, true blue, diamonds, priceless
Get this, you want a battle? Tsk-tsk
I give yo ass a slipped disk
Get your thumb out
Get a ride home, hiking, hitch-hitch
Hope you get killed in a ditch-ditch
Bring your girl around Rhymefest?
She gon’ get kissed lips
Drug test, you all piss-piss
Karate snake-bite mother-(woo!)
I call it Hiss-hiss
Dick chocolate like Swiss Miss, sip this

[Coda: Michael Jackson]
Higher! Oh!
Wanna take it higher? Come on!
You got to take it! Oh!
Why don’t you take it? Ooh!
Come and take it higher!
You wanna take it higher?
Ooh! Oh!

[Outro: Rhymefest]
Yeah, see, we gon’ get the Holy Ghost in here tonight!
We gon’ raise the roof up in here tonight!
See, you could let your grandmama hear this!
