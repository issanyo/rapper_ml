[Chorus]:
Every time it feels my feet are too close to the edge
It's always you that pulls me right back in
And when I'm in these streets too deep and I'm drowning
It's always you that pulls me right back
It's always you that pulls me right back in

[Verse One]:
I always tried to be the cool one
Level head, kill the drama, try to move on
Before it turn into some beef we gotta move on
And I ain't scared but when it's on, turn the news on
It's Chi-Town, niggas know how we get down
Gang bang wrong colors, turn your hat round
So many shorties, flat line, layin' flat down
Or locked up, doin' time from the pat down
Black, brown, momma please, what you tellin' me?
I can't vote I already got a felony
I supply the key, rules don't apply to me
Fuck sobriety, the Hennessy can cry with me
At Ford, 80,000 jobs was all cut
And last week, some shorty shot the mall up
So now either we can ball or we can ball up
And I don't really give a damn what they call us
It's all lust

[Chorus]:
Every time it feels my feet are too close to the edge
It's always you that pulls me right back in
And when I'm in these streets too deep and I'm drowning
It's always you that pulls me right back
It's always you that pulls me right back in

[Verse Two]:
My grandmother keep tellin' me to slow down
My grandfather said, "Let that boy go now."
My girlfriend always wanna focus on her goals
Picket fence, bank account with a couple 0's
My old homies wanna see me on the straight path
But when I'm doin' right my new niggas straight laugh
And that's what make it bad
And that's what take me back
To the place where everything I do I wanna make it last
I work hard, but I still wanna make it fast
Maserati, no breaks, me and you on the gas
At a speed so quick we can erase the past
There's no way that this feeling wasn't made to last

[Chorus]:
Every time it feels my feet are too close to the edge
It's always you that pulls me right back in
And when I'm in these streets too deep and I'm drowning
It's always you that pulls me right back
It's always you that pulls me right back in

[Verse Three]:
I don't want your sympathy, we don't need the handouts
Just even the playing field and give us some land now
Ghetto Godfather, I'm the black Marlon Brando
Ahhh
Livin' life like it's planned out
But you can never foretell my tale
And you bought the CD but I'm not fo' sale
It's somethin' you gotta feel like blind folks braille
And I can't leave the state cause I'm out on bail
Hell
Has no fury like a jury
Sentence me, no tears, eyes not blurry
Surely, I'mma come back with the fury
Hands in the air man, holla if ya hear me

[Chorus]:
Every time it feels my feet are too close to the edge
It's always you that pulls me right back in
And when I'm in these streets too deep and I'm drowning
It's always you that pulls me right back
It's always you that pulls me right back in

The cops wanna take away my freedom
Haters don't wanna see me in a pool
Take away the cars and the jewelry
Then I'm only here cause of you

[Chorus]:
Every time it feels my feet are too close to the edge
It's always you that pulls me right back in
And when I'm in these streets too deep and I'm drowning
It's always you that pulls me right back
It's always you that pulls me right back in
