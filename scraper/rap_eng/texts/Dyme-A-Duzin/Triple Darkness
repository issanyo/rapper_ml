Darkness

Darkness everybody

[Verse 1]

Headphones on the A train my base blaring
Fuck I ain't caring they keep staring at me
Like I don't have a second to breath
Paycheck spent cause I invested in trees
Just to connect with my celestial beings
They told me never stress because I'm destine to lead
You in it for the bitches then its best that you leave
Cause resting with these heffers how you catch a disease, follow me now
Sheesh, Freshest in the school, never tested
Pressed or messed with because he cool but his text spit
Never take his kindness for weakness
Or the shotty will tie dye your t-shirt they'll find you in bleachers
He body who beefing, solemnly decided emceeing
Killing cafes in the cafe cause nobody could beat him
A cash cow now, gotta be somebody to see him
He overseas he ain't seeing niggas, he ain't even seen niggas

Play the strings for a young King nigga

[Hook]

Flawless, Lawless
Regardless, Triple Darkness
Flawless, Lawless
Regardless, Triple Darkness
Flawless, Lawless
Regardless, Triple Darkness
Triple Darkness, Triple Darkness

[Verse 2]

Just when you thought New York rap was gone I gift wrapped a bomb
Bump it hard thorough your city block
Stunting hard for the city cops
See a pimp stacking like a dealer L's lit I'm high
I'm here to revive its no Biggie Pac
You should already know my STEEZ
These molly rappers are TUH, tell them easy on the E

No Pun intended, its R.I.P nigga fuck your feelings

This world today, such a burning age
Is being fueled by computers that your on all day
They think your stupid, which you eventually are kid
Should've listened some more you're pissing me off, get in the car
Let me drive you somewhere thats not to the grownd
A nourishing concoction of sound we washing it down with HOPE
And Hopefully it leaves an after taste to carry to the masses
Take a breath and speak a real world after fake

Got me preaching like pastor Ma$e
Next lap pass the collection plate

[Hook]
