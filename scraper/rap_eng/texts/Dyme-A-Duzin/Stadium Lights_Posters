Stadium Lights/Posters

This that mufuckin Crown Fried shit man
Let me get a 2 piece and a biscuit
Welches grape
Hot sauce in my bag you know
Cause we here
Greasy finger lickin good man
Crown Fried!

Can't be sitting round waiting for better me
I ain't fuckin with that shit if it don't better me
If she leave me I know she won't find a better me
I'm the boy they wanna be and you can bet on me
Better me been turnin shit up for the 17
Veterans been in this shit since I was 17

Feel like everybody ridin in a foreign
Feel like everything wanna fuck a foreign
Feel like everybody gotta have what everybody got
But can't even see the beauty that's in yours
Damn
Everybody competition, pass the baton to my parter guess this is our Olympics
Ghetto, that's how we living
Stilettos supply my women
La pearl la & vicky secret
Not minding how high the rent is
Eye low as my intention
Span need it right this minute
Land we can park whips in
Phantoms & Maserati
Inspire through optimism
Choose Queens careful
She dont understand she not your wisdom
Dont fuck around and give a thot your children

All these bitches tryna come up on a corn
You sucka you a lick and this her sport
Heard you trickin from a pillow talkin source
But I ain't snitching, she a body, she a corpes


Can't be sitting round waiting for better me
I ain't fuckin with that shit if it don't better me
If she leave me I know she won't find a better me
I'm the boy they wanna be and you can bet on me
Better me been turnin shit up for the 17

Blocks full of stadium lights
Shine through the day and the night
Cameras are on for the show
Better learn the game and play it right

Feel like everybody ridin in a foreign
Till I catch'em ridin on the Iron house
All that skurt skurt, you just makin noise
Boy to be a boss gotta have the balls
Pause
Money is the motivation, facing the avenue
Authentic depictions of living to show it gratitude
Then come these cynical local niggas attitudes
Mad at you. Not seeming that enthused when you back with news
Fuck rap, I done made a milly off the rock
City on the map, imma bring a billie to the block
You ain't never represented, you ain't in it, you just watch
That ain't really who you are, this ain't really what you want
Put in work, for you criticize, give any advice
Put in 5 for you come & hit a spliff up in this cyph
Sinners sin, niggas lie
Police lights, lit the night
Theivers theive, swipers swide
Love is free, life is life

Member when the broadies said we goin win
Said we goin win, said we goin win
Member when the broadies said we goin win
Said we goin win, said we goin win
Member when the broadies said we goin win
Said we goin, said we goin

Posters on my wall of my victims
Posters on my wall of my victims
We adored you as children
No remorse gotta end em

Jay on my wall, Ye on my wall
Eminem, Snoop Dogg & Dre
Greats on my wall, all day I'd recorded
To one day replace every name on my wall
Sheesh
You know it's ok to aim for the greatest right?
And thinking you trash ain't the same as hatin right?
I just slave to slip in the list of my favorites
And ain't no bars in the sentences that you mention my name in
Twitterin subliminal disses, internet gangsters
I can tell they all in they feelings, it's in their faces
I praised Gods, copied their styles, studied their cadence
Learned from your stories, pops never taught us it's like you raised us
But lately I feel we were Marvin Gaye'd
Encouraged us to engage in self destructive behaviors
Hung to every word I would listen
Time cut you off find my vision
