Brooklyn, New York is our hometown

It’s DyMe-A-DuZin
Swank Sinatra
I feel old Brooklyn, let me bring you up to date on this

[Verse 1]
Uh, I’m a product of Jay, Biggie and Kane
Hotter than a cart with no conditioner on a train
Saw hood niggas change, blood and crippin’ in their gangs
Into hipsters when their jeans start fittin’ to they legs
Mashed Out Posse’s, Mos Def’s and Kweli’s
Lil’ Kim’s Foxy’s, Fat, Busta Rhyme’s
I’m Sunset Park, East New York Canarsie
Brownsville, Bushwick, Red Hook, the Fort Greene
Hustle like the youngin sale'in reefa out on Fulton
I’m hood like a quarter-water, ballin’ like I’m Jordan
Got a hood-chick from Flatbush, forever let me smash it
Jizz her and I dip’, she call me Ol’ Dirty Bastard

Baby, you should spread your love it’s the Brooklyn way
Ordered Chinese food ‘cause mama didn’t cook today
I tried to holla at this chick when I was on the A
Turned up her music, guess she wanted me to go away
Well excuse miss flower Coochi
I seen enough movies to know you’ll be a groupie
When I’m rollin’ in the Jag’
Trashed my bus-pass
‘Till then I use this metro less I got it for a caps
I like my trees like my girls when I’m rolling my piff up
You be going green like a Williamsburg hipster
30-some to name, gotta budget my shit
I bought a dub and spent a dollar on bummy and chips bruh
My clique live but labour day at the parkway
Show’s packed opening day at the Barclays
BK all day, even if we part ways

Brooklyn, New York is our hometown

[Hook]
Cross the bridge, walk with me
Tried to warn you but you all were sleep
We taking over, you boring me
My coast is here, and we all are beast

And we representin’ Brooklyn, Brooklyn
X3

Cross the bridge, walk with me
Tried to warn you but you all were sleep
We taking over, you boring me
My coast is here, and we all are beast

And we representin’ Brooklyn, Brooklyn
X3
And we representin’…

Brooklyn, New York is our hometown
