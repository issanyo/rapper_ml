Verse 1 Dyme]


[Chorus]
Now everyone put your left hand in the sky
We still bout' the right because everybody lies
So is it really right to put it up to God
Knowing that we live a life ascending til' we die
So with all to respect Mr most high
Are you willing to propel me
This is my time
Baby this my time
This is my time The Rebith



[Verse 2 Dyme]



[Chorus]
Now everyone put your left hand in the sky
We still bout' the right because everybody lies
So is it really right to put it up to God
Knowing that we live a life ascending til' we die
So with all to respect Mr most high
Are you willing to propel me
This is my time
Baby this my time
This is my time The Rebith



[Verse 3 Capital Steez]
We all got a few problems to address
But me I got a few things pilled on my chest scratch
Trying be the best
[?] respect to the death
You only can be what your mind lets you
So i turn that beat
To find rugfuess
The side effect of minor getttin inspired by a pencil
To move everything around me is limitless
The kind is like the biggest threat
To ever hit the internet
But infinity something you can't find
Unless you open your mind
But to bad we are blind
Before the seeing I have to paint a picture for em'
We thinking wrong and we happily missin {?}
Doobies can stink higher when they mention me
I highly disagree because knowledge is the missin key
And with it we can do the impossible
Thats the death to industry and power to the trinty



[Chorus]
Now everyone put your left hand in the sky
We still bout' the right because everybody lies
So is it really right to put it up to God
Knowing that we live a life ascending til' we die
So with all to respect Mr most high
Are you willing to propel me
This is my time
Baby this my time
This is my time The Rebith
