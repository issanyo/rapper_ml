[Hook]
Letting go my problems
Switching old to new
Got a couple dollars and im off of school
Its alright now
At least right now

Trying to get my shine because it's overdue
Bagged a couple numbers and im over you
Its alright now, well
At least right now

[Verse 1]
Finger-pop the haters
Screw the world and make the bed shake
Things are looking up like a perv
At the bottom of the staircase
These other MCs can't match up near his weight
Share a plate?
Dymez, E & Pat, a sure way to get your ears raped
Sheesh, quit with all that boring ish
Skeeting on recordings
And your whore can get a quart of it
Horning chicks
That I thought i'd only see in porno flicks
Stunting on your blog raps
With corvettes and cardigans
Looking for a cat to bring back the art again
God painted the character
Made a movie star in him
You are all the audience
But are all applauding this
Corniness more of these
Frauds and its, got me pissed

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Got my fam straight
Got my band cake
Ride with the =X army
Fuck a fanbase
They seem to be the only ones that understand they
Much love if you been riding since negative ten days
Life is just a ride and im enjoying it
If I ain't had music to survive
Then what's the point of it?
Some A&R's will brush me off because they dont get it
In the meeting, just a bowtie
Blazer I'm spitting
Like im crazy and demented
Maybe because that is it
But I know I can't please them all
So im just chilling
Long as the people hearing him
And im saving them from getting thin
From giving in november
Gifting heaters in the winter
Then im good, good, good
