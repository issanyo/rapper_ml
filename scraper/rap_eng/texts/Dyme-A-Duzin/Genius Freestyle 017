Just another day of painting pictures spittin' scriptures aye
If I died tomorrow I'd forever be that nigga aye
I will never put no Xan or lean up in my liver aye
I am from New York I'm not these bammas that we imitate
Get it straight, niggas love to dab and hit them folks
But I'm from crack viles, blocks of broken glass and missing folks
Cop harassing us the most
Ducking wagons, getting low
But coming where I'm from and looking at us now, you wouldn't know
This ain't gentrified or hipster, chickens fried, and niggas broke
Shrooms and acid shit is mad we wasn't having this before
Iron horses with a fire breathing dragon in my coat
He want the bread he get the toast
I hope his ass is with the smoke

I finesse on every track they feel the passion in my quotes
They surprised I'm on their roster
Bitch I'll pass I been this dope
They was shady now look at the aftermath, I'm in their scopes
Was sunning cats before a crown dad hat was in a store nigga

You knew I murdered this before you heard this shit
Bodied the bag, toe tags and church services
You heard of this lyrical verbalist, slash herbalist
The wrath of these cold blooded verses are merciless
Been in my Birkin I'm certain this what my purpose is
She just want a purse from a rapper her man worshiping
Splurging on the perks you can't purchase it
Funny how she curved me in the DMs but in person I'm inserting it
Woooow, I'm back in my bag
These freshman niggas not in my class
I'm like a dark skin Curry, from the East
Still slick like Dickies with the crease
Desiigner on my feet
In a Yacht a couple thotties on the beach
Reeking for the Herb is in the leaf, niggas know that Paak
Since 21 been a savage you ain't know that, facts
This Lil Uzi that I carry make ya Kodak black
