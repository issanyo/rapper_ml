[Verse 1]
I ain't seen you since the summer
Think it's time I pulled up on you
Ain't forger to save your number
It's something that I won't usually do
But it's cold where I'm planning to land
And I'm the mood to hold a hand
On a PJ in my PJ's
Tryna make it there by midnight
Faster than a freeway
Had to make it to you on time
I'm not one for cuffing season [?]
But I'm feening what I ain't used to

[Chorus]
Want you around my [?]
[?]
Blowing trees
I got a gift from the job it make you wanna get up from your sleep
My gift so loud probably hear me through the chimney (Chimney)
Cause tonight I only have eyes for you
Tell me what you want from me?
I only have eyes for you
Making love under the tree
Cause I am the one that you been wishing for
Wrapped in a ribbon outside your front door
I only have eyes for you

[Verse 2]
Got some goodies in the oven
Careful not to pick 'em up too fast
Often sweet just like my loving
Curving like a fucking hourglass
Let's not save this just for holidays
Let's make love like this everyday
It's gon' be like it's snowing in California when I have you froze up
It's gon' be like gifts under the tree when I wake your ass up
I want the perfect [?]
So you would know what's going down, down
Now you know it's going down

[Chorus]
Boy won't you come around my [?]
Blowing trees
I got a gift from the job it make you wanna get up from your sleep
My gift so loud probably hear me through the chimney (Chimney)
Cause tonight I only have eyes for you
Tell me what you want from me?
I only have eyes for you
Making love under the tree
Cause I am the one that you been wishing for
Wrapped in a ribbon outside your front door
Cause I only have eyes for you
