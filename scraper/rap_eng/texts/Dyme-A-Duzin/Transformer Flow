[Intro]
It's Dyme-A-Duzin
Brooklyn, BROOKLYN!
LORD DIGGA!

[Hook]
They tried to jock my Swank so I had to transform my flows
I got some money in the bank & my friends transformed to foes
But I don't need them (NO) no I don't need them (NOPE, NOPE)
I dont need them (NO) no I don't need them. (NOPE)

[Verse]
SHEESH, rappers biting styles never paying homage
Tapes is garbage, I'm spitting rounds now my safety's off
So name the target
Take them apart & you can tape & watch it
Blog it & beg whoever's hardest to come take a part in
Name an offering, I'll double that & then I'll take it all
You think you hard but, I call it management just raping artist
Taking prophet, but you so loyal & patriotic
That you bend over & take it all. Its shameful dog, I'm facing ganja
I'm fried, no tempura, your rhymes are transparent, my flows are transforming
These men, are menstruating, relax, no tamps for them
Mad they moving packs & I'm traveling lands foreign
I would die for this, 11 years I've had to strive to get the tittle, shit
So why these sissy's got such a sense of entitlement?
Fake followers & "viral hits"
Its ruff for rappers, all that shine don't make you diamond kid

[Hook]
They tried to jock my Swank so I had to transform my flows
I got some money in the bank & my friends transformed to foes
But I don't need them, no I don't need them
I dont need them, no I don't need them
