Verse 1:
The world is full of cruel people
That you think are cool people
'Till they get close enough to be cruel to you
I keep my circle small but surprisingly
The haters and the backstabbers keep
On finding me
But you're a different type of chick
Not to mention the perfect match for my
Lips
Just playin' I made a list
And it goes a little something, like something, like this

Verse 2:
I like you more than like
Pepsi over Coke
I like you cause you're sexy
I like you cause you're Dope
I like you cause you had a sense of humor when we spoke
I'm Cool with everybody, but I like you more than most
You compliment my swank, Girl I like your style
Never getting jealous when these other girls around
I like that you ain't scared to hit it when we blowing down
Never backstage but supportin' in the crowd
I like you for you're freedom
I like you for you're space
I like you for you're brain and I mean that both ways
I like you cause you're real and them other girls fake
Thats if the real you is what you showing to my face

Chorus:
Go on
Do you
Live life
Until I get to hold you again
Be my wife
For the night
Because I gotta hold you again
Love me for good, Love me forever more
Love me realistically until I'm a bore
But if I'm not then call
And we'll start all over again

And we'll start all over again.(4x)

Love me for good, Love me forever more
Love me realistically until I'm a bore
But if I'm not then call
And we'll start all over again

Verse 3:
I like you cause you're honest
I like you cause you're sweet
When you walk in front of me and let me squeeze you're cheek
My peeps really like you
I like you for my peeps
Phony as a group and me individually
I like it when we kiss
Act like a couple
I like the way them other boys stare cause they want you
Actually I don't
But I like your smile
I like the look you gimme when you know it's going down
I like you when you're flirty, when you hold my hand
I like the way you sounds in my head, I'm you're man
Yeah it does, Doesn't it?
Don't you like it too?
You won't pay attention cause you busy doing you
You just like the party
You just like to chill
No strings attached, whether or not it's real
Sheesh!
I like when it's something I can't even help
Problem is that so does everybody else
