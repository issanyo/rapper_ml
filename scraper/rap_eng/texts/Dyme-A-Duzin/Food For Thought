Phone going off cause they waiting on him
I told them "hold on, imma place your order
We hitting blocks, store fronts & the corners too
So if you know what you want, you know what do. Huh?
You can get the food, you can get the food
You can get the food, you can get the food
We serving Blacks, Latins, Asians, Caucasian too (OK)
So if you know what you want, you know what to do

For that chicken Popeyes on the Ave, yeah my niggas different
Cause you can get the 2 piece or you can get the biscuit
Another brother lost his soul what the people tell me
Caught slippin, had the biscuit he ain't  squeeze the jelly
Reminded me of Juice or a scene from Belly
Shots pluck his top off he ain't need a skelly
Even pies in the hood like a hot & ready
Meanwhile, shit I'm good man I'm hot already

Bobby shmurda made Hot already
& then they did the shit again like it ain't hot already (OOOUUU)
Been chef cookin with the pot already
1 hit & then you flopped? DAMN not already (not already)

6am I'm on the block already
Food keep me compensated, I supply the commissary
Momma screaming, child in need of feeding, bitch why you fiending?
No freals on a higher scale tryna really beam it. (Hello?)

Welcome to the crown can I take your order?
A pair of wings to help you levitate. Some water?
Purple drank or you get baked off the eights & quarters?
But keep our secret safe cause Jake tryna make a quota
Crown rollie with the black face
It's less about race when you got cake
..Project nigga winning in this rat race
Blind to the experiment that got me feelin that way

Stunting for the days that they called me a lame
Then explain all the rewards, the tours & the fame
Broad on my arm thats looking like a foreign exchange
Why supporting em? how he going off on the stage? Why they applauding him?
How he moving forth in his lane?
You live & you learn in the life & when your growing there's pain
As I got older all the stories that they told us didn't mean much
Cause they just as districtive as the substances they feed us

FOOD, can't sit at my table im superior
FOOD. Eating off your style & getting rid of ya
FOOD, Your indenty's whatever that we're telling ya
FOOD, Read it in your history & literature
FOOD
This is warfare, this warfare
FOOD
Treat us like the Gods don't belong here
FOOD
Your destinies a dealer not a ball player
FOOD
Go up to the yard, all your dogs there
FOOD
Dogs serving, China man serving dogs here
FOOD
And still getting dogged, cause we dont care
FOOD
A writer that enlighten them them like Voltaire
FOOD
Saving young society from Paul bearers
FOOD
Hope they dont get caught up in crosshairs
FOOD
Prayer that the devil ever cross here...
