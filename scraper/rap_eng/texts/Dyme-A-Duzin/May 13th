[Verse 1]

I been that nigga since birth and I knew it, hey
Sheesh
I been that nigga since birth and I knew it
And I knew, hey
Finna win me a Grammy, an Emmy, an Oscar
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
This money, I want it, I need it to prosper
This vision I see it, lets leave this behind us
And swear that we really gone be there soon
Somewhere in the air with the city in our rearview
High above the seas, I can see it its a clear view
Anywhere but here's cool
Anywhere but here, could you take me away

[Chorus]

I been that nigga since birth and I knew it
I been that nigga the news just new to you
Knew my destiny all that was left was to do it
I'll be that nigga till death and I know it

I been that nigga since birth and I knew it
I'll be that nigga till death and I know it
I been that nigga, a nigga just new to you yeah
Yeah

[Verse 2]

Aye, you looking thicker in your pics oh my
The one I'm tryna get with oh my
You and me together be the shit oh my
Who this nigga that I'm seeing that you with?
I be preein just to see if its legit
He be on the scene think I see him in the mix
Girl you should be free you don't need that shit
If you were would me wouldn't be like this
How many times is you finna let him slip?
All up in your friends DM's thinking he a pimp
Get him off your brain you don't need that shit
Since the 9th grade been a fiend like this
& I'm talking sidekick, blackberry, BBM days
Flattop, bowtie & some sunshades
Inviting you to shows but you never ever showed
Now I'm packing out the rows, hope to see you one day
Back when your right hand tried to get hit
Couldn't the risk, you a dime, she a nic
And I'm guessing that its all in God's timing & shit
Born at the same time girl you mine I'm convinced like..

[Pre-Chorus]

I pray you find
Your hearts made to be closed to mine
Prioritize our other lives
Our souls just said "I do"

[Chorus]

I been that nigga since birth and I knew it, hey
Sheesh
I been that nigga since birth and I knew it
And I knew, hey
I been that nigga since birth and I knew it
I'll be that nigga till death and I know it
I been that nigga, a nigga just new to you yeah
Yeah
