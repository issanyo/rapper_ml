[Intro]
Hey you
I just landed
For some reason you not pickin' up ya phone
Just seein' wus good witchu
Miss you
Hit me back

[Verse 1: Kehlani]
You up at 6am at JFK for a flight
You callin my phone to see if I'm alright
But I can't answer now cause my roommate's asleep
It's 3am in Cali and I just hit the sheets
Because I worked all night, and you worked all night
You just called to hear my voice before you catch that flight
And I hope you know to call me as soon as you're safe
When you first hit the ground, when you get to your place

[Chorus: Dyme-A-Duzin & Kehlani]
I got time
If you got time
When you made me yours, I made you mine
Regardless of the space we're fine
Regardless of the space we shine
So when you're so far, so gone
You're so far away
Every facetime, phone call, I just called to say
I love ya, I love ya (2x)

[Verse 2: Dyme-A-Duzin]
Stay up!
You the only one to make me
Stay Up!
Girl I'm comin' home why dontcha
Stay up!
As soon as I touch down
I'll make sure you're high
You'll never come down
Even though I'm in another time zone
You the only one that my mind on
Hit ya Skype but ya signed off
Hit my FaceTime on ya time off
Blowin up
We both get our grind on
Knowin' that we gotta stay focused
On that red eye
Stay hopin'
I'm back to the woods
I'm the first thing smokin'

[Chorus: Dyme-A-Duzin & Kehlani]
I got time
If you got time
When you made me yours, I made you mine
Regardless of the space we're fine
Regardless of the space we shine
So when you're so far, so gone
You're so far away
Every facetime, phone call, I just called to say
I love ya, I love ya (2x)
