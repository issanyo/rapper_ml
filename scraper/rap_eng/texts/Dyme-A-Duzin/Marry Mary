[Intro]

Shout out to Kount he my day one
Cru Alxndr my day one
Steelo he know he my day one
1160 them my day ones
Best in Brooklyn don't play dumb
You disrespect they might spray sum
My clique get masked up like Jason
Your kids'll vanish no trace son

[Verse 1; Dyme-A-Duzin]

Godly presence in my energy
Enterprises in my intellect
Irritating all of my enemies
Buzzing like intercoms in the jects
(Nigga I'm) Not a nigga from the Internet (Nope) not a nigga that you finna test
(Nigga I'm) Not that nigga that you finna try (Nope)
Get your family if you figure that (Family)
Bar stool cross your bitch's back, car pool, get your children wet
Hov & Biggie is my competition these new Brooklyn niggas never been a threat
(In the west) With a marijuana cigarette
Fuck your wave I'm on some bigger shit nigga
My bitch is wavy on some Bigga shit
I go hard seven days on some Adventist shit
Why NY struggle for hit? We invited this
I just speak the facts and vent in my sentences
I release a track & end the pretending shit
When you say real shit the censor it
I kept it real since I rolled with them phony niggas
Glowing no way to control me nigga
Move through the beef like I'm Kobe nigga
She hold the D like a trophy nigga
D-Y-M-E

[Chorus; Dyme-A-Duzin]

Back in the bitch on my bullshit
They didn't give it I took it
They wonder why I'm so Brooklyn
Back in this bitch with a full clip
My niggas trap & do music
I just might snap if you push me
I just might marry that Mary
I just might marry that money
I just might marry that pussy
I just might marry that Mary
I just might marry that money
I just might marry that pussy

[Verse 2; Broadway Joe]

They wondering what I am doing here
Sitting clean and the newest pair
You can tell by my shoes that this dude is rare
When I look in your eyes I see super fear
When you walk around the town man you super scared
What you doing here?
I bang on these beats I'm like Luger here
Double cups, double pumps bring the ubers near
Cause my shooters here

[Verse 2; Dyme-A-Duzin]

Tryna double up the net worth while you worry bout who got the best verse
Before I ball in my bars I'll invest first
Stock in the 40/40 & the Nets first
Presidential after the award ceremony hitting shorty in my dress shirt
Views of the water while I'm slaughtering your daughter, 21 she an expert

[Verse 2; Broadway Joe]

16 had the best purp, flex first every morning cash a check first
I bool on the block and these angles protect me
I'm ducking the ops cause they tryna detect me
Just explain it Dymez, don't be wasting time
We just hit a lick, we just made it Dymez
Bitches poppin pills, yellows taking lines
I don't wait in line, Imma do it all
Till it fade to white
So Imma go marry this money
Imma go fuck on your honey
Blowing out smoking while I'm doing 100
Gosh you niggas ain't getting no money
Man I just trap & do music, take the gun & the mic & just fuse it

[Chorus; Dyme-A-Duzin]

Back in the bitch on my bullshit
They didn't give it I took it
They wonder why I'm so Brooklyn
Back in this bitch with a full clip
My niggas trap & do music
I just might snap if you push me
I just might marry that Mary
I just might marry that money
I just might marry that pussy
I just might marry that Mary
I just might marry that money
I just might marry that pussy
