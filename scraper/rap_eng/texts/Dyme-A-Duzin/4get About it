(Intro)
It’s like
I swear
It’s not really what I expected
Guess it was my mistake
My shallowness uh
Shit, uh

(Verse)
She only a freshman
But seemed so mature that I had to arrest her
And look so good that my homie should step in
Try to block on the clock, dom I’m next in
But she only a freshman
Park sloap chick in the burn into sexing and but
Between convertin  and lesbian
A jump off if you thinkin more, what the fuck is you getting in?
Guess I had to learn the hard way
Now I’m stuck between a rock and a hard place
The hard place is in my pants
And the rock is in my face but she’s too hardheaded to understand
And I wanna be her man cause she stupid
An immature brat that I make through my girl lust in Cupid
Tryna stay with it is useless
You wanna fool with it and I’m like do you , foolish

(Bridge)
This is the end I suppose, as far as we know
As far as we know
We could've had the time of our lives
But your emotions put you too far behind
I don’t have the time
To stop and double back
It’s too much trouble, girl I think

(Hook)
We should 4get about it, we should 4get about it
We should 4get about it, we should 4get about it
We should 4get about it, we should 4get about it
We should 4get about it, we should 4get about it
We should just…

(Verse)
How can I love one that’s in love with a blunt?
Or give to one, I don’t know what she want
Or be romantic but want out to front
Even though I’m with her
It’s been a month then I’m feelin like another nother
I can see why you wanna get a Asian and black from the backpack and luggage with her
Laid back we relax and it’s fun to chill
But try to get deeper than that, there’s really nothing in her
Just an innocent soul into in dust charcoal  ‘cause of cigarette’s smoke
Every shallow dude's goal
Cute pic comment , every internet post
In the window they stare
At Kimora Lee's twins, show these images of hoax
But I really don’t care
Did that, been there and I already know

(Bridge)
This is the end I suppose, as far as we know
As far as we know
We’re gonna have the time of our lives
But your emotions put you too far behind
I don’t have the time
To stop and double back
It’s too much trouble, girl I think

(Hook)
We should 4get about it, we should 4get about it
We should 4get about it, we should 4get about it
We should 4get about it, we should 4get about it
We should 4get about it, we should 4get about it
We should just…

(Verse)
Need me a bottom Shawty
Ain’t got no time for kids
Thought you were something special
But that’s just what you is
Girl forget about it, I don’t need you, go!
Experience, experiment, girl live yo life

(Bridge)
This is the end I suppose, as far as we know
As far as we know
We’re gonna have the time of our lives
But your emotions put you too far behind
I don’t have the time
To stop and double back
It’s too much trouble, girl I think

(Hook)
We should 4get about it, we should 4get about it
We should 4get about it, we should 4get about it
We should 4get about it, we should 4get about it
We should 4get about it, we should 4get about it
We should just…
