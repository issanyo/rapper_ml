[Verse 1]

I got the music in my mind, hit the booth and its alive
Search the truth and ye shall find
That the flows been the coldest since 06 and you ain't know shit
They boasting like the best but thats just marketing/promotion
Dope, money got them thinking you the dopest till they hear that Hip Hope shit
My hits potent, spitters in my clique focused while these boy band niggas Chris Stoke'in
Thats just gross, my wrist golden
Sewed seams over seeds I'm sewing
See the silk when I leave it open
Suit swank still reefer blowing
I used to chief on Sunday morning, think the Deacon noticed
Dosing tryna keep composure, street a leave you decomposing
Shit, I'd rather be composing, overseas performing
The preacher told him write scripture with your penmanship
Pulled out the pen while thinking fuck arithmetic and spit the real shit my nigga

[Chorus]

Why Lie? When I'm soaring through the sky
Yeah, we starved but the hungriest survive
My story is divine, this is God's gift, I hardly even try
Now these lines switch our water into wine
Like nigga, why lie?
When I'm soaring through the sky
Yeah, we starved but the hungriest survive
My story is divine, this is God's gift, I hardly even try
Now these lines switch our water into wine

[Verse 2]

In reality the industry ain't what it seems
It ain't about your record label its about your team
And now-a-days it ain't what you write its about the hype
And outsiders say they love you but they bout the cream
Some things I've seen and I share it with my Kings & Queens
Keep it in the fam, cause these vultures focused on feeding theirs
Know that and be prepared, no money being scared
If you ain't have no intentions to stay, why you even here?
Raised on the east side, all I would see is grind
Mama made church hats and Daddy sold bean pies
Made me a mixtape, serving CD's, T's & flyers
Your admired if you helped me reach these highs
Shout out to my step pops, supplying equipment
Micky, Shnider and Fritz, and Preedomworld for the fire & mixes
Send love to the home for my grandma
Lost both of her legs but still heres something to dance to
