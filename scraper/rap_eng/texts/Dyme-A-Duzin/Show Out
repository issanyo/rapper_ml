Workin too hard, been going in way too long
Family & friends like what are you waitin on
Enegry runnin on low my & patience gone
Still I give it all

You can run & tell somebody that your boy done blown up
I turned stuntin to a hobby, hatin don't concern us
Even though you try to hide it we already know whats up
I Know ya'll know that it's a body every time we show up
Show out, show up
Show out, show up
Show out, show up
Show out, show up
You can run & tell somebody that your boy done blownup
Know ya'll know that it's a body every time we show up
Show out, show up

Showed out when I showed up, showed up when I showed in
Wanna know what the show bout
Watch close cause the shows him

From the Marks & On Nostrand
Hilltop where I'm posted
What a good job that my folks did
Nah mama ain't never take no shit
Pop & me wasn't the closest
We wasn't too social, visions of
Pictures from prison I'd pin up like posters
On visits I'd tell you I love you but to an extent cause I just didn't know you
Let me not get too emotional
I need that chicken to produce
I'm so much bigger than local
Garments calm from the middle east
Won't let this new garbage belittle me
Won't fall for your trickery
I'm on a new vibe different enegry
Ain't surprised you a fraud you been finicky
Jeolous of the star that I'm finna be
Raise a bar you could never reach, Dyme-A
The greatest the God, the Jordan, Lebron, 23

Workin too hard, been going in way too long
Family & friends like what are you waitin on
Enegry runnin on low my & patience gone
Still I give it all

You can run & tell somebody that your boy done blown up
I turned stuntin to a hobby, hatin don't concern us
Even though you try to hide it we already know whats up
I Know ya'll know that it's a body every time we show up
Show out, show up
Show out, show up
Show out, show up
Show out, show up
You can run & tell somebody that ya boy is blowing up
Know ya'll know that it's a body every time we show up
Show out, show up


SHEESH
I need to separate from the basic
I need first place in these races
I don't have a place in this matrix
You dont feel the pain in these statements
You don't shop at dollar tree, ya family dont gotta
Broil waqter just to bath in the basement
(Red lining) all your bank's aren't racist
No lights , no fridge (section 8 shit)
Can't whip cause I'm missing my payments
Suspensed for swipin my ubers
Got no line just Wi Fi & computers
No A&R or producer thats lendin a hand like "I like what you doing"
I put my life in this music
When you unripe & abuse it
Sore bones Ache when it rains
Battle scars on me still unduring pain
But if your team want a war,  no second thought boy it ain't a thang
Cause my 1 got a gun, 2 bang blue, 3 throw B's, like Meda Worldpeace
And the 4th & the 5th let the 45th shoot, swish

Told my day ones they ain't even gotta wait too long
Feelin like I'm the one Brooklyn been waiting on
Candidates running on low & ya'll patience gone
So I give it all to you
