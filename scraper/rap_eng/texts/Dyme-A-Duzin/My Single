[Hook]

Know these finals got you stressed, now I finally put your body to the test. What it is? What it do?
What you hiding in that dress? Am I finding gold or diamond in your chest? Is it there? Who are you?
She don't know my single but she like me
She ain't even single but she like me
She don't know my single but she like me
We ain't even single

[Verse 1]

Let them talk about us, so what
Fuck em they don't even know us
Call me when your coming over
Got so much I wanna show ya
I'm longing for your lust again
Your pictures got me practicing
No, I ain't cum to kick it with you

Cause clearly we too old to be fronting take your clothes off or something
Its the two of us and no one is around
I want us to explore one another, never blow it up cause girl that ain't my style
Let me lay you down

[Verse 2]

Take off your shoes, let me get your coat
Let me spark this conversation while we sip this slow
Stimulate your mind until I strip your soul
Get a snippet of whats inside before I enter holes
HOLD UP, my homies want her
A work of art I hope to bring her home to MoMa
She was holy till she rained that holy water
Now she be wet, so wet she want me to record her, (plus she older)
Cause clearly we too old to be fronting take your clothes off or something
Its the two of us and & one is around
I want us to explore one another, never blow it up cause girl that ain't my style
Let me lay you down

[Bridge]

You know that I been wanting you
Showed you my soul now show me that theres one in you
I know this moments over due but
I had to find the time to find myself in you

(Oh boy you know I want it) I know you do
(Oh boy you know I want it) I know you do
(Oh boy you know I want it too)
(You feel so good that I might fall in love with you)

[Verse 3]

She like a model
She like, She like, She like a
She like a model, aye
SHEESH
She like a model from a video
So fine I even got her in my video
Gotta see me every time I'm in your city
Gotta see me every time I'm in your city
Like, Like a model from a video
So fine I even got her in my video
Gotta see me every time I'm in your city
Gotta see me every time you in my city
