[Verse 1]

Perfect range to aim & flame ya
Pray our Lord and savior save ya
Trini ting look like Topanga
Grabbed the grip and than I banged her

Hit the flex they know ya boy
Know ya boy now polaroids
Designer clothes they throw ya boy
Swag at shows I showed you boys

You sold your soul posin boy
Hold this L, it's over boy
The crown newest golden child
Brooklyn's latest poster boy
Your jewls foil Soulja boy, whoa
10 fold, Going overboard
You niggas bickering over boards
I bent her and over Bon voyage

I need a bitch from the islands to top me while I'm bending blocks in a stolen ride
I need the police to chase me while I'm gettin face all on Facebook recorded live
I'm not to play with I told you guys
Genuine heart and perverted mind
But they won't get it niggas pull up with a mask and a blick and they mortified, that..

[Bridge]

When you get the time put that pussy on me
Girl you're way too fine to be feelin lonely
You know I'm on the rise (Bitch act like you know me)
Come fuck with me tonight

[Verse 2]

Danger, danger, danger, danger
The game is not how they portray it
Half these cats is lame and famous
Artless aims to gain the paper
Shit just ain't the same for gangstas
Our role models changed and changed us
They ain't spittin flames they flamin
They ain't finna fade they flagrant

Ballin, ballin, ballin
If that's really what you call it
More than often I been on it
Filmin porno or a lit performance darn it
I deserve to be rewarded
Must admit it I been exhausted
All of the Intercourse and the concerts
Run up the commas and run thru condoms

I been a star I'm just in alignment
Dyme been that nigga since birth
Ghetto Olympics my shirt
I used to spit in church
Reminitant of the holy scriptures when a nigga spittin a verse
If he trippin then get a with a Nigga that's richer & triple your worth

[Bridge 2]

When you get the time put the pussy on me
Girl you're way too fine to be feelin lonely
You know I'm on the rise (bitch act like you know me)
Or your girl can get the pipe (I might hit your homie)
