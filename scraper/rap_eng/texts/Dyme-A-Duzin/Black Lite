[Bridge]

Pardon me young Dolly Parton
Just seeing you could get me started
Hate to see you leave but love to watch you walking
From front to back you know your shit retarded
I don't wanna stress no more, no
Baby pass that fronto
Show you what I got in store
You know I love it babe

[Verse]

You don't need you a mini ass bitch you already in a coup
On the real in the city I ain't never had a shorty like you
Ass so fat in the Black Lite glowing like blue
Still in my memories, still mean what you meant to me
I know your secrets
Bout who you been with, who you be with, all your demons
Celebrities thats tryna fuck & how they fiendin
These niggas lust, you never trust, you got your reasons
Quit all that tough shit you the sweetest, girl
That pussy poetry to me, even when your lips don't speak
And when I arrive
Its therapy to me, a feeling that these pics don't please
I'm ready to ride
Sanctuaries praising your shrine
Praying for the day that your mine
You sitting pretty what it do?
I'm in your city what it do?

[Hook]
Tats all on your body
Black Lites in this party
Black Lites in this party
Henny & Hypnotic
Henny & Hypnotic
Henny & Hypnotic
Tats all on your body
Black Lites in this party
Black Lites in this party
Tats all on your body
Henny & Hypnotic
Its just you & me in this party

[Bridge]

Pardon me young Dolly Parton
Just seeing you could get me started
Hate to see you leave but love to watch you walking
Might have to take another trip to Slauson
I don't wanna stress no more
Baby pass that fronto
Show you what I got in store
You know I love it babe
