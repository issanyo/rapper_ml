[Verse 1]

Baby we stars, star, ain't nothing that you can tell us
Cause we gracing the carpet, but still live in the ghetto
Don't know our names but they flick, celebrates looking at us
Chillin' with models that buy out the bar and smoke cigarillos
She said he flashy, flashy, girl I'm glad you feel that way
A model and she bout to blow? You should come and demonstrate
Being thirsty ain't for me, I don't chase women
My life's straight with the people god placed in it
Shorty called me Diamond Duzin but I ain't trippin'
I'm finna put Diamonds in her mouth like Wayne's dentist
Cause my bop got a little more swank in it
And yo bop got a lot of NSYNC in it

[Hook]
If you're looking for the Phonies we'll be posted by the bar
With our fake I.D.s, Sheriff Pj & Elijah getting Lawst
Plus it's Elbee Thrie, Grizzy B, Aja G & Bari Boss
And we flippin' the fingers at all ya'll
Sippin tequila we Lawst boy (2X)

[Verse 2]

Memoirs of a hood star, hitting yo local hood ARE
I don't even battle no more, but I still wish a nigga would (BARS)
Crew them up, spit them out, how could you take these rappers seriously?
Avery tried to get at me, who's still around though him or me?
Thought so, back to macking shiggys by the bar bro
Lil liquid courage turned our convo to a talk show
You heard these new rappers? What you think bout 'em?
(She) said this "drink got me clouded", never mind girl keep downing
Got a rose gold wrist and she lick her lips and talk like she bout it
But its so much chicks if I home run hit then I'll miss the 3000
I got her number cause her body was amazing
Little does she know that I be riding on the A train

[Hook]

[Verse 3]

Flows are the illest, foes didn't feel it
Now my clique gonna blow so they pose like they in it
Hatin' on our shows but your girl there though
Got her in the front row and she knows all the lyrics
(I told you so) never fold for a critic
Or a weak one trynna put holes in your spirit
One rolled in a swisher, oh what a feeling
How I'm getting bank rolls just to show how I'm living
Nah I ain't focused on the throne you trynna sit in it
Just trynna provide jobs keep my homies outta prison
Knowing that they'll never leave me dolo in a mission
Anybody harm then you know who goin get'em
Got a whole lotta women and some hoes in attendance
Won't let a nigga breath like holes in your tennis
Signed my deal wrist froze in a minute
Ring worth more than your soul lil nigga, like SHEESH
