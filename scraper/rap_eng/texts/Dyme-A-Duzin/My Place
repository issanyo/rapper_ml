You just feel it, From the flow to accent in lyrics
Feelin outcasted, I was scared & detached, I'd would fear it
Forced to adapt in, project habitats fit to kill us
Slave masters & prisions
Storms poured cause cracks the ceiling
Here I capture the vision,  how we whipped in the back system
Black babies left basterts, section 8 but still swaggin
Incarceration in masses, somehow we weave thru the maddess
Don't care if it's weave or its natural to me it dont matter, lately I been
Havin fantasies of Grammys
Feed the family
I need some mo for the posse let's up the anti
Granny an amputee, cancer just struck my auntie
She claim she can't breath but puff them cigarettes daily
Bless her heart, we was livin in the livin room
Couldn't keep a meal at home, cousins always stealing food
Bro still boost, on the bus, but his kicks are cool
Yeezy, yeezy, please make these affordable  for niggas toooooo (You ain't got no Yeezys nigga?)

My mama taught me respect, my city taught me finesse
My cousin toaded a tec
He'd leave his heater in bleachers & ball at the rec
.Try to play me or talk any foul shit I make call and you wet
2 from the line, 3 from the distance, I call it calling collect
Call the connect, up for the shipment, shout to my plug in the west
.I hit the road on
Returned to my mother with checks
But I admit that I missed it

And when I'm gone I get a strong feelin
Its that "I been away too long" feelin
And when I'm gone I hope that home feel this
Cause I need that
Cause I be that

You raised me right
Watered me wiser
Opened my mind up

A loving fighter
Sinful & rightious
I'm from the Heights, yeah

And all I wanna do is, give you praises and the truth is
I don't know why I just want you to love me


I was bought up in a church round corner from the parkway
Found it hard to focus on jahova tryna make the preacher my fiancé (Beyoncé)
I was tryna make beats while my niggas on the corner pitched Kanye
Hard drive crashed I would dash to the ave and recorded by the Barclays
I been handling the rock but I'm not quite own
Wear Crown on the head, whether ceaser or dreads, walk royal through the spots I rome
With influence I create, and the moves that I make all my piers feel a lot like clones
But the friends that make and the fans that I meet make the world feel alot like home
