[Verse 1]

My hands on you, you got a man, thats cool
Cause we here (and he's not, he's not, he. Wouldn't want you to be lonely)
I got some plans for you. If your down. 
Then let me know right now, let me know right now.
The universe has chosen where we're led. 
So my way with with words didn't get you in my bed
Some things in life are better left unsaid.
So close your eyes, open wide. 
Pop that thought bubble and bring it to life

[Chorus]
Does he really (X3)
Mean as much as you made him seem.

[Verse 2]

Lips, hands, connected by an excuse
But who knew you wanted it too
Now you're right in front of me boo
Been stuck in reality for a long time
Would you save me, baby?
We've gone too far, but I'm as wrong as you are
But "one day" just happened to be today
Put down, your guard
and see it's not that hard to be
Bad, does he really?

[Chorus]
