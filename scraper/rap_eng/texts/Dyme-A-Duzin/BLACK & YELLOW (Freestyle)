[Freestyle: DyMe-A-DuZiN]
Dudes are feminine the dyme a douche getting in'em
Spittin' venom, till the little tracks they get are finished
I'm in a white and navy. Yeah the ish is rented
Lease I ain't got my wife and kids living in it
Broke aaaaa, rappers getting toe tagged
Rapping over yo smash, bang it in it's throat (gag)
Since I'm underrated and hated on the most
Imma be banging on yo doe, telling these labels they can blow (Me)
Screw you please don't follow standards, suit and tie
Because I'm into classy, fashion. You don't seem to match it
A women is a queen don't call her B unless she act it
That's if she a stinger to the green she be attracted
...She's nasty, (player), You mad, see you (later)
If you want to see me at your spot, this time, doing that, then past me the paper
It's mastery, work real hard like an ath-a-leet, mad at me?
You will get dragged and beat, GOD you don't even matter
It had to be, a low life talking it saddens me
Why do these boys be attacking me
I don't Phil that noise ya'll Jazzin' me
Throw'em out the back of the balcony
Cause you being ungrateful
No "thank you"'s in a house full of banks
It's Ashley, Hilary, Carton
A rap artillery, all in ya coffins
Coming soon, catch a milf hunter in your mothers womb
Lauren London used to be my baby till she **** with tune
Nah no disrespect, love Weezy give'em dap
But I know I ain't the only one that's thinking that
I got these dumb rappers putting on they thinking caps
In the presence of a real emcee perhaps
They hear the beat I snap, my ADEEN attached
Jimmy riding with me, he a "g" for that
Phony people back, we a bad breed
Mad, be giving rappers headaches, bad weed
Every game take it to the hole like Raz B
Here to bring hip hop justice like Flash Team
Broadway Bow Tie click
Finish up ya coke line, co-sign this
Cause we so bomb, wouldn't wanna pass on nucca
Who you with, gon' flake like pork grind chips
Cause they fake. What kinda "ish" you on mate?
These rappers be acting like pads beneath them always
That D.A.D never gone never change, he was better off (chained) and they let'em off mayne, now he bout to set it off, see you can bet it all
Still don't gotta say curse word to be a threat to ya'll. And I'm headed off...


Yeah You know what it is, when it's time to ball I'm balling like a Knick
18 points 22 assist, if the beat is hot then Imma borrow it

Yeah... yeah... lemme borrow it

Yeaaah lemme borrow it
