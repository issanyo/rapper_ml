[Verse 1: Dyme-A-Duzin]
This is my world,
You can all enter,
Marijuana field with no gold picket fences
Cracks in the yellow brick road to the riches,
Everything ain't pretty
But the gold digging chicks is
Informers & snitches
All in your business
Never used a fist but they palmin' the clips
It's war with the boys in uniform
And the kids
And the boy's tryna ball
And the boy's on the benches
We're all on defensive
In case somebody try to take mine
Life's hard but I gotta keep tryin
I wonder if they taping my line
Cops circling my block 3 times
I'm looking all around
All I see is red eyes
Painted on smiles
Fake friends in disguise
I'm just a man with a heart
Getting caught up in the lies
Coming from every direction
So there's nowhere to hide

But this is my world

[Hook]
This is where I was sent
But not where I was meant to be
And though nothing is changing
I can't let it get to me
So where do I go?
It's killing my brain
And destroying my soul
But this is my World
This is my world

[Verse 2
There it go..
There it go, there it go
There it go, there it go
They don't know
There's something sharp up in my coat
Waiting for 'em when they approach
Nah, I ain't no gangsta
But get shanked thinking ima lick
A damn shame it's the way we gotta live
Putting fear in the hearts of innocent little kids
To feel they'll never escape
And see what life really is
But keep your head up, little one
There is way more to life than these slums
Life in these slums
Knowledge is everything, little one
We are kings
We are queens, little one
Ah, and they know
We are worth way mo'
Don't let 'em make you feel low
Cause they know
We'll be having power of knowledge
And cease all of the violence
They can't stop us
This is our world!

[Hook x2]
