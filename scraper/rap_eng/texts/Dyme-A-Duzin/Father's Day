[Verse 1]

Whats the purpose of a father?
Shiiit, I'm doing pretty good without mine
I even grew to be a man while he was serving his time
So whats the use it? I got a pop dukes in my moms
I mean hey, I don't care bout you missing some graduations
Thanksgiving, Christmas's, every time that I played in
No Father figures, just bigger sisters to raise him
Sending jail pictures to get a look at your face, man
These are moments pictures ain't replacing
Love me all my life, but you'll never find your way in
How could you love someone that you were never there for?
Therefore my lack of love won't let me feel yours
And I'm reminded every Father's Day
Years of birthdays you never sent a call my way
Years I needed male advice and you were gone away
"Have faith, God is your Father" thats what my Mom would say

[Hook]

But some times I really wish
I grew to know and love the reason I exist cause
On the real, ain't nothin that I wouldn't give
Just to be with (My Father) I think I need a therapist
But some times I really wish
He taught me how to ride a bike or how to drive a whip, thats
Probably reason that I still can't do the ish
Because I needed a, because I needed a

[Verse 2]

Nah, I don't care about all that
I've become a master at ignoring my own past
Blow grass, cypher with the Phonies, go home
Mama compare me to the man that I'm embarrassed to call "Dad"
I be high, in my genes so I see why
3rd grade, you got out, bow ties, bean pies
Reppin in new movements, told me that I shouldn't do music
No fast food, no red meat
"I'm back no, get used to it"
You weren't packing 4 bags and moving into shelters
No support, she was by herself and nobody helped her
So I don't wanna read your pamphlets or messages
How you gettin married t a tramped in Connecticut
When the wedding is, how rap is irrelevant
And how you won't claim ebony cause she's a lesbian
I blame you for keeping us from each other
And me not knowing my sister well enough to say I love her

[Hook 2]

But sometimes I really wish
You were around to raise me & my bigger sis, see
We try chatting but it doesn't really click
Because we need our (Father) I think I need a therapist
But some times I really wish
He taught me how to ride a bike or how to drive a whip, thats
Probably reason that I still can't do the ish
Because I needed a, because I needed a
