[Intro: DyMe-A-DuZiN]
That's the the type of shit like (x5)
DyMe-A-DuZiN
Traphik, yeah
EOM on the beat

[Verse 1: DyMe-A-DuZiN]
New school kid with an old soul
Shoes should be saddled, head should be soul glow
Or even further back, old school ford, rose
Cadillac, hand me down a throwback Volvo
And I’ll be cruising down the road with my misses
Pose then I go and grab the door when she gettin' out (Check her out)
You can tell she thick from her silhouette
In a dress, huggin' on her body like a pillow pad (Gorgeous)
Only thing lower than the horses is my hypeness
Got a swag like King George VI
With no hesitation
My clothes will show for the spectatin'
Don't know where you been then you ain't going places
I go where the globe had soul and I stay in
And bring it back to you
Only people is the crew
Traphik and DyMe's phone tag with your moms (Coward)

[Hook: DyMe-A-DuZiN]
They don't understand my style
They told me that I'm stuck in the past
Ain't nothing wrong with the now
I just want that old thing back
We some fly young gentlemen (Fly young, fly young)
I'm a fly young gentlemen (Fly young, fly young)
We some fly young gentlemen (Fly young, fly young)
I'm a fly young gentlemen (Fly young, fly young)

[Verse 2: Traphik]
Now, who you know who do it better than me
A fresh pedigree that’s ahead of my league
I’m that real man that you ain’t ready to see
With a swag on a level that you’ll never believe
Fly young gentleman
Buy my own car, no rentals, man
Ladies tell me I got gentle hands
Tryna make them all smile that’s my dental plan
Skinny leg jeans, too proud of my kicks
Walk into the room, they announcing my shit
People gather round at the sound of my hits
And by the way my IQ is like a thousand and six
Clear the runway me and Dyme so fly
James Bond steez with our fresh bow ties
Bums stay home cuz you not gon' pass
Step ya life up and act like you got some class

[Hook]

[Verse 3: DyMe-A-DuZiN]
I'm into Facebook, poke-war with Sarah Palin
I think that old wine is fine, know what I'm sayin'?
These immature chicks like immature players
See they love Chris Brown 'til he punched his girl face in
But gentlemen'll never hit a chick unless she's into it
While being intimate
Rihanna holla at a kid, you so bad
Let's make a baby and be in the wind
Promise I won't do you like the black Eminem

[Verse 4: Traphik]
Dyme's you a fool, we can put it on the milf
I keep my nuts cool always got them in the silk
I drink champagne with my chicken wings
And I don’t give a damn what ya kids will think
That new Hugh Hefner, find me at the grotto
Sippin' from the bottle keep it cooler than gelato
Fly Young Gentlemen, that’s the new motto
Couldn’t buy my fly even if you won the lotto
Biatch

[Hook]
