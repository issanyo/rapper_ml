This is not your anthem, this is not to dance to
This coke with arm hammer, quotes from cemo to cancer
A note from angry neighbors, "fuck you" to space invaders
"Bye" to the gentrifiers, won't sell our souls for the paper
This is a million lions. Rowdy cause rent is rising
Our culture disregarded, our leaders tipped to silence
How could you walk the land I've lived for life and criticize them?
Shittin & sleepin in parts you could never spend the night in
You are still without a paddle swimming up shits creek
Hold on to your chicken your chick Bitch ain't shit sweet
Niggas still from the dirt
You can still get murked
Cap peeled for your percs
If you scared go to church

Runnin round my city like you own it
If you ain't from the block then why the fuck you on it?
In my day I'd would rob for your Jordan's huh
Police wouldn't pull up or report it
Life of the poor and unimportant
Foreigners with fortunes, landlords are cornered
Forced to move the family cause can't afford it
Shit done changed in where I came from I just can't ignore
The wave of tourist, we never welcomed somehow they staying for longer
Culture is fading , I'm down to go in a blaze glory
Cribs gettin raided, hidden leases, homes taken homie
Shit gettin crazy, they movin in and then enslave the homies
Life of the poor and unimportant
I grew up on this block and imma fuckin own it
In my day I should pop you for your Jordan's
Police wouldn't do a muthafuckin

Crown Heights gone bounce to this
Bed Stuy gone bounce to this, uh
Flatbush gone bounce to this
Brownsville gone bounce to this uh
Fuck that Fake Brooklyn shit
Fuck that Fake Brooklyn shit uh
Fuck that Fake Brooklyn shit
Fuck that Fake Brooklyn
