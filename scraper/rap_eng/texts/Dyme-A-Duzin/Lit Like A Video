I got my eyes to the sky, I'm praying to the suvior
They been dying for the sauce, I thank him for the favor
When the times get hard, escape them with the paper
When the times get hard, escape them with the paper

You know what he saw?
Seashells at the seashore, wait
Hold on, man I think I seen whores yo
What's that? Bro I think I see more, hey
The shit lit like the videos
Shit lit like the videos
We in VIP with the pretty, whoa, hey
The shit lit like the videos

Batman of this rap scam, they flash cams
Watch the women & wonder which one I smash, damn
I tried to leave a Louis lane for you bustas
But you just didn't do this no justice this just in
Big Dyme-A's back, sounding like the albums crack
Shit ain't even drop I need a platinum plaue
Saw shorty ass and caught an asthma attack
When them shots buck duck down for your crown get tapped
Woah
Lane switchin, what kinda shit he on
Been abroad, I kicked my year off with a thicker jawn
Niggas pawns, I'm  spittin better and doing iller songs
Tell Flex, fuck these niggas I need a bigger bomb
This Sadyme-A-Duzin, Smoke LAden, Barack O-Dyme-A
Pass that potent, pop that bottle
Pour it for a pop bitch too, I'm not that shallow
But when we leave, her, not you. I need a model

Got my eyes to the sky, I'm praying to the suvior
They been dying for the sauce, I thank him for the favor
When the times get hard, escape them with the paper
When the times get hard, escape them with the paper

You know what he saw?
Seashells at the seashore, wait
Hold on, man I think I seen whores yo
What's that? Bro I think I see more, hey
The shit lit like the videos
Shit lit like the videos
We in VIP with the pretty, whoa, hey
The shit lit like the videos

Amongst the snakes and the vultures Dealing turnt users
I'm just prayin that they all overdose to take over, never
Toast with enemies I'd rather stay sober
Dealin with the game know you bound to change
Chains & designer things, lights make the life seem closer
That ting out ya range less you tryna Range Rover
Niggas goin broke tryna keep up with them folks
Twirlin in whirlwinds, wifing up thots leaving girlfriends
Bags & purses, racks on plastic surgeons
Trashed and earlin, Gram goddess trash in person
I ain't sittin here and actin like my past is perfect
I'm just hate a nigga had to be the last to learn it, the fuck

You know what he saw?
Seashells at the seashore, wait
Hold on, man I think I seen whores yo
What's that? Bro I think I see more, hey
The shit lit like the videos
Shit lit like the videos
We in VIP with the pretty, whoa, hey
The shit lit like the videos


You're gonna change the game
However as long as you go along with what's popular
Your never gonna be succeed at what you're doing
You gotta change the whole game and you can do it
