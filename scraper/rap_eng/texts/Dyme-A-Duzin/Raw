[Intro]

[Verse 1: Dyme-A-Duzin]
Uh, my city gentrified and my chicken fried
My rent is high, but I'm getting high (uh)
I know the system ain't designed for a nigga
Who these laws even written by?
It's clear they allowed the genocide
My desires like a set of crimes
The government is [?] to legitimize
I ain't nothing but another nigga in they eyes
Man down
Niggas turn to zombies over xans now
Proceeds feeding all the fam' now
Police preying on the [?] now
We just eating how we can
And if we don't really got it, we can find it and we share
It's a product of environment, the dollar bill is scarce
Now the eyes up to the sky to see if God is really there (pray)
Father help us find what wealth is buying
Necklace, rock designer, move our mommas out the projects
And the [?]
I'm surrounded by McDonald's, Checker's, Popeye's and [?]
Fast life is popular, regardless Im'ma pop under pressure
Maybe die of diabetes, like my grandpops in this pressure
Pop you 'cause I'm popped, couldn't get my pockets together
Played 'em for pussy
Act surprised, 'til he got popped when he pressed him
That pussy like perkies, I pop 'em, forget her
Strive for the cheddar, but...



[Chorus: Dyme-A-Duzin]

[Verse 2: Oswin Benjamin]
My god
Momma prayed to take the stress away
She working
Check the check, I check the pay-stub
Income's lower than her self-esteem
She raised a rose from out the streets
Fertilized her from the shit they talkin' 'bout
Trump is bringing back the Reagan era
The crack [?] sell it off for a small amount
The writing on the wall, tell you what it's all about
[?] on the elevators
Pist-off at pissy fumes with elevators
To reach the stars
Still laying on a cloud of loud
Of sour d
These [?]
