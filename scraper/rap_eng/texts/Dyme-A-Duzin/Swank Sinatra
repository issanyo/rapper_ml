[Intro: Sample]
Well I got something to say, you know what i mean
(Yes)
I I haven't been on the radio before, you know, hey baby how you doing today?
(Haha)
You know I wanna say hello to my brother out there
(Hey, a lot of folks been around)
EY BROS
(Thank you again)
(Fine, enjoy the show)

[Intro: DyMe-A-DuZiN & Capital STEEZ]
This for all my Murrow niggas
Beastcoast
Pro Era
G shit
It's Phony Ppl
Plain Pat what up

[Verse 1: Dyme-A-Duzin]
Difference between me and you
You think you should have it and I deserve it
Dwelling on the past and I'm in the lab working
Never spoke to God in the hood, there's bad service
But I guess I got bars cause he sending 'em for certain
Swanky Sin, got critics questioning what lane he in
I'm just turning crowds into stadiums
Pounds, I be blazin' the haze when I listen to Waves
On the road searching for stones like Jackie and Jade

[Verse 2: Joey Bada$$]
Ain't shit fly unless I rock it
High like drop kicks in cockpits
Red Eye fly shit, holding chop sticks
Split cheese with monsters
Switching keys in partures
Ain't pick a decent sponsor but bet I'll still archer
Yo Dymez, I got them, slow ride through Gotham
The villain drink black like I'm Gothic
I be in the lab spitting topics
Mixing toxics 'til the prophet's pockets profit
Or 'til I get boxed in

[Verse 3: Capital STEEZ]
T-shirt from Polo, the rebirth of YOLO
If I'm trying to find a Pro though all I got to do is yodel
Steaming on the low, got have me dreaming like a mogul
The humidity is killing me, I call that the ozone
Capital Swank, finally had the cash up in the bank
So the snakes want to ask me if I'm great
We laughing in your face cause rap was a mistake When the entrees came, they almost had me eating steak

[Verse 4: CJ Fly]
This hip-hop with a fly feel
You'll be dead if you lie still
It's all about what you choose to do, buy steal
Hood niggas like grim reapers, they soul takers, black hoodie bone breakers
Put you to sleep, then you won't wake up
I mean, you could go from weight rooms to waiting rooms
Be armed or curled up, when that piece to your chest, so make your move
No April Fools, I just say the truth
Gonna be a vacant tomb if you break the rules

[Interlude: Sample]
(How about style, performance?)
Oh, style is, is, is, is cool man, you know
(Mhm)
And i mean, it's got to be sharp

[Verse 5: Joey Bada$$]
My gift is my curse if I lift it I burst
But fuck arms, I do enough harm when I'm kicking a verse
I heard niggas went missing, where the dirt is when you surface?
What you mean I ain't earn this?
They ask for my service
Emotions in his flow caught a wave, now he surfin'
But notice these demons and serpents be lurkin'
It's urgent, still a rebel, fuck school, burn shit
Don't ask him to pull up his pants up, it irks him

[Verse 6: Dyme-A-Duzin]
Til I die of an overdose of the dopeness, I'm floating higher
Flying above the coast and just scoping and getting wiser
I am a product of this box we call pop culture
Creative pop filter bringing our collapse closer
Batman of this rap scam, they gasp over
Spit facts over these tracks, deeper than Shaq's vox
Dyme's dope, stay on my grind cause I know
That time slow, puffing that lye smoke but time don't

[Verse 7: CJ Fly]
Wait
You causing quakes when you're moving plates
Illuminate, eliminate got me thinking that it's the same
Won't let a flow like mine ever slip through the drain
Cause I'm fit for the game, watch me shift through the planes
The rap monster boss is popping off if cops involved
Shocked them all, dropping draws/jaws, now they chakras off
Eating lobster sauce, stop it, dog, I'm above the law
Led 'em on, weapons drawn, it's the art of war

[Verse 8: Capital STEEZ]
I can feel it getting closer
As Ls turn to clips
Clips turn to roaches and those turn to bowl hits
Oh shit, looks like we getting high again
That's another gramof fires right to my diaphragm
I blaze a dutch, then I pay the cut
You be on the wall posted up, trying to make a cuff
Groupies on my arm just to prove that we swank enough
Let me see you take a puff while I break it up

[Outro: Sample]
(Fine, thank you very much sir)
Yeah, thanks, look here man
(Yes, mhm)
I sure appreciate you calling me all these things, because I don't be doing too many interviews and things
(Well, fine, we appreciate your time and, uh)
Yeah
(Thank you once again)
Ey look here, you know, I mean my people tact, and we has becoming vocal, in, in, in, in the world today
(Enjoy the other show, we'll talk to you again)
Oh it's very, hey, hey, look here man, look
