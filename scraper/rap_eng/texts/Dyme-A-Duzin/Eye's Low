[Hook: DyMe-A-DuZiN]
Turnt up but my eyes low
Full cup taking toaks a the Fronto
Blow the smoke in the air while I ride slow
Blow the smoke in the air while I ride slow
With my ex getting text from my side ho
The whole world waiting for my shit to drop ho
Blow the smoke in the air while I ride slow
Blow the smoke in the air while I ride slow

[Verse 1: T-Shyne]
Riding through the industry, All these bitches into me
Labels tryna hinder me, but they won't get my energy
Before that ill be the black Cobain sippin Hennessy
Gun up on the counter couple bullet that's the remedy
I might just pull it, get up out my skin this ain't no leprosy
They don't want to see me make it and that's because of jealousy
All these niggas want is Audemars
My niggas doing B's & E's going door to door
Shorty want the seamen like she going overboard
Speaking of sea my niggas'll leave your body by the shore
The industry ain't playing no games
Cause them niggas will Robb your ass for your whole name

[Bridge: T-Shyne]
The industry nah wan fe see mi make it
They just want mi soul but mi won't let them take it
The industry, The industry nah wan fe see me make it
They just want mi soul but mi won't let them take it

[Hook: DyMe-A-DuZiN]
Turnt up but my eyes low
Full cup taking toaks a the Fronto
Blow the smoke in the air while I ride slow
Blow the smoke in the air while I ride slow
With my ex getting text from my side ho
The whole world waiting for my shit to drop ho
Blow the smoke in the air while I ride slow
Blow the smoke in the air while I ride slow

[Verse 2: Hefna Gwap]
They say he live like, he got no expectations
But do expect em movin quick
Swift like Jason
Life lika long road in the pitch black
You know niggas out there 2get u
And niggas like bats
Industry street like the trap
These Fukin bloggers be like checkpoints
When I'm pullin off drunk
No way? O Kay
I really do this shit for oj
T bring the propane
Blow the dope in the air
Fuk the 5 0
Ski skirt on the office ass niggas
Like a white road
Check the flow
These label gone hear me
I go stecope
Bet I blow
A cocktail be my gennie
Like, I bet I blow
Bet he hot
Put that on wood like I bet they hop
All on on dick
These candy rappers fallin
On some some fallin shit
Garbage them

[Bridge: T-Shyne]
The industry nah wan fe see mi make it
They just want mi soul but mi won't let them take it
The industry, The industry nah wan fe see me make it
They just want mi soul but mi won't let them take it

Full cup taking toaks a the Fronto
Blow the smoke in the air while I ride slow
Blow the smoke in the air while I ride slow
With my ex getting text from my side ho
The whole world waiting for my shit to drop ho
Blow the smoke in the air while I ride slow
Blow the smoke in the air while I ride slow
