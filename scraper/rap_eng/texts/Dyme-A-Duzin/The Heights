Live from the mighty Mecca
He of the livest ever
Home of the greatest artist it's hard to describe the pressure
Heights I must climb and measure
Trying to strive for better
Cheers for your solid effort it's time for the God to step up
Reside on the Marks & Nostrand
Lived with moms & sisters
I chose the pen & pencil
Pops in the pen for pistols
Pop and your kid'll miss you
I never front because of his credentials
I earned my stripes the lines I penned official
Fuck is the referee, I got them pinned for 3
The best to be, when I bless the beat, you can bet I'll beast
I penned these niggas hits, they really reference me
Like became international unintentionally
My trap house, kinda like my dope spot
Utica my bros spot, school you what you know not
Whipping over stove tops, you can say the kitchen is my booth
Whip a hundred hits a day and then distribute it to you
Comin hrough, back up, back up
Presidential shit, comin through
Back up, back up, young kings gettin rich
Channel Jordan in the sixth, while I'm pouring up a fifth, or a forty
Put a try to trey to any one you niggas trip
Hunnit


You've been gone for so long
You've been low for so long
So afraid of the heights
So afraid of the heights
You've been gone for so long
Oh you've been low for so long
So afraid of the heights
So afraid of the heights


Live from the belly of the beast
Deeper fried niggas swimming in the grease
Ock sellin out the deli up the street
Head shots never pity the police
Center of the city where I sleep
Prospect to the west & the Vill is on the east
North side Bed Stuy, Flatbush & the Gardens at the bottom it don't matter how you get it, gotta it (Chicken)
All I ever wanted was to run it, all I ever need was some money
I remember fiendin for the bitches
Now he got dimes by the dozen
Pull up & the scenes star stunned
Make a bad bitch pull it out the genes start dumbin
Cash out and blow thru my budget
Smokin to cope with my brothers


D.C chillin in a hotel out of state
In the bed with a shorty from a show I had yesterday
Hey, I think it's safe to say
I'm not a kid anymore
Cause all I see is
Hunnits, (Real hunnits) hunnits
Hunnits, (Real hunnits doe) hunnits
Hunnits
Hey, I think it's safe to say
I'm not a kid anymore


Wakin, bakin on the lords day
Satan on my shoulder
Concentrating on what God say
Hatin niggas I considered fam wasn't for me
And I figured out the hard way
I don't say "what up" to niggas, I don't fuck with sucka niggas
I know fakin is your forte
Suck a dick I got no patience for the foreplay
This isn't love it's a lie, I can feel the vibes
My city gentrified and my chicken fried
My rents raised to more than I can afford
Got a feeling that they don't want the kid alive
Every corner got a crown or a liquor store, damn
You see that new juice bar right? They won't stop till my hoods all white
Plus my niggas still move off white and swipe, fuck around and have to boost our price


To the ones I feel I've led astray
Been along time since I've been away
No more waiting this Kings here to stay
Foes are fleeing, feel the wrath they face
Been a long time since I've been with you
Spent all summer seeing my vision through
Fuck your feelings this Kings here to rule
Foes are feeing

D.C chillin in a hotel out of state
In the bed with a shorty from a show I had yesterday
Hey, I think it's safe to say
I'm not a kid anymore
Cause all I see is
Hunnits (Real hunnits) hunnits
Hunnits, (Real hunnits doe) Hunnits
Hunnits (Yeah, real hunnits)
Hey, I think it's safe to say
I'm not a kid anymore
