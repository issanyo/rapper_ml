Brooklyn (Ghetto Olympics)

[Verse 1]
Some niggas blood and some niggas crip
Some niggas thugs and some niggas is bitch
Some niggas really ain't got nothing, some niggas rich
Some niggas die frontin', some niggas live in the shit
Nobody gon' speak your truth
Gotta story, you should tell it
Ain't nobody gon' speak your truth
