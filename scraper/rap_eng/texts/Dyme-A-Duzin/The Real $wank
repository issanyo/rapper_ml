[Intro]
Crazy

[Verse 1]
I'm full of myself, my iTunes full of myself
Securing my wealth, they thought that I was put on the shelve
But its funny how the homies that you help be the same ones
To get up on their feet and then forget where they came from
I changed none, never been a slave to the fame son
Still a give an emcee the beats if they play some
Still a man that your managers a say stay away from
Still planning this World Dyme-A-Nation
Imagine us shapeshifting our ways through your radio stations
Getting paid in places you never could play in
Calling me competition then your caught in the matrix
I'm Dyme-A, I'm Keanu ya'll agents
You must of popped a molly & forgot who you came with
Some Trinidad Jame$ shit, your PUMA Disc ain't got the same fit
Your compacts ain't got the same hits
You ready for combat? I'm sitting on the empire waiting

[Chorus]
"Feeling So Unreal"
Gotta thank the lord
We made it far and we still going
Still changing, still grwoing


[Verse 2]
Rappers biting styles never paying homage
Tapes is garbage, I'm spitting rounds now my safety's off
So name the target
Take them apart & you can tape & watch it
Blog it & beg whoever's hardest to come take a part in
Name an offering, I'll double that & then I'll take it all
You think you hard but, I call it management just raping artist
Taking prophet, but you so loyal & patriotic
That you bend over & take it all. Its shameful dog, I'm facing ganja
I'm fried, no tempura, your rhymes are transparent, my flows are transforming
These men, are menstruating, relax, no tamps for them
Mad they moving packs & I'm traveling lands foreign
I would die for this, 11 years I had to strive to get the tittle, shit
So why these sissy's got such a sense of entitlement?
Fake followers & viral hits
Its ruff for rappers, all that shine don't make you diamond kid

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
I heard they waiting on me, they waiting on me
Waiting for it to be our go, these rappers corny
Like how dare you start shit with your big homie's big homie
Like flows don't roll deep, my only broadie ho I'm Pro D
I only know me, your whole team is for themselves solely
If duckets were on your dome they would buck it & let your soul leave
I'm charging bricks for a mention
They playing internet killers, I'm on the internet killing
I ain't into the twitting, so I'm offing every kid in attendance
Put your career in a coffin for getting caught in your feelings
Orphans into your children, this isn't war its scrimmage
Got a problem then I'm coming at your boss with the business
Show me your leader, show me verse, play me a heater
Show me a show, show me a vid, I never seen one
Spit something hard scribble a bar & respond back
Like your chick hasn't been in every kid in my squads lap
But I don't judge her past, we used to date but when I saw her last
She was drunk off 40z telling us how you be coming fast
The last violator Chris Lighty co-signed
You just a groupie dick riding getting no shine
Raiding rappers cubbies, cutting into the lunch line
Running in the ring giving stunners & clotheslines
Eating off my swank for too long & now I want mine the pioneer
Annihilation thank you for waiting the Dyme is here

[Outro]
The Real Swank (X3)
Nigga its the real
The real
Its just the beginning niggas
HIP HOPE, let the music speak
