[Verse 1]
I bagged an older chick, and she's ultra thick
Super fine and everything that's on the stoves offic-ial
She's old enough to be my older sis, and she's 26
And she picks me up from school in a Caddi, turning heads and looking flashy & nah
That ain't my mommy but she stay callin me daddy
Got a body like Nicki, A face like Cassie
Her shoe game vicious, her jaw game nasty
She don't even ask me for cash that I have she's
Independent so I throw it in the bag gladly
And I don't mean being able to pay for her plans
I'm talking bout' putting food on the table for her fam, I'm the man

[Hook]
I know your older, but I could
Put that aside and treat you like I would if
If you were younger, and be your man and yeah
I understand that your a little more to handle but I'll
Put It On A Milf, Put It On A Milf
There ain't nothing wrong with doing the grown, baby I'mma
Put It On A Milf, Put It On A Milf
And I'll be gone before your man come home
Uh oh, uh oh, oh

[Verse 2]
Getting off of work baby don't make any plans
I'mma lay your body down, I'll be gone before your man come
Seize all my elementary dreams and my fanta-
Sies punish me until a nucca throw a tantrum
Its weird to call you mama cause you old enough to be her
And I might be a youngin but I'm old enough to teeth her
She might have a husband but I'm bold enough to please
While her daughters in the crib and shorties a heavy sleeper
And I don't know, how you explain stains on your carpet
And me walking around the apartment with only boxers on
I'm drippin wet, red kissing on my neck
She said "where's daddy?" I said he's me I guess

[Hook]
I know your older, but I could
Put that aside and treat you like I would if
If you were younger, and be your man and yeah
I understand that your a little more to handle but I'll
Put It On A Milf, Put It On A Milf
There ain't nothing wrong with doing the grown, baby I'mma
Put It On A Milf, Put It On A Milf
And I'll be gone before your man come home
Uh oh, uh oh, oh

[Verse 3]
One day I cut, got caught slippin up
5th time going in, time like 6 or sum
She ain't hear it but I heard him coming in or sum
Your spidy scenes on blast when you stickin sum
Jumped up quick cause I ain't tryna catch the jack
Grabbed the pack of gold caps, shimmied out the back
He came in the room she played sleep like she pose to
Later on hit me on twitter like I taught you

[Hook]
I know your older, but I could
Put that aside and treat you like I would if
If you were younger, and be your man and yeah
I understand that your a little more to handle but I'll
Put It On A Milf, Put It On A Milf
There ain't nothing wrong with doing the grown, baby I'mma
Put It On A Milf, Put It On A Milf
And I'll be gone before your man come home
Uh oh, uh oh, oh
