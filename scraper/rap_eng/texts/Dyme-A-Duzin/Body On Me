[Intro]
Yo this really my theme music
Swank (SHEESH)

[Hook]

Shorty want me
You gone & she be calling on me, get a hold of your freak
And she'll probably OD
Cause when she hit my phone, I know its cause she probably want D
Put that body on me, She wanna put that Body on me
She wanna put that body on me
She wanna put that body on, wanna put that body on

[Verse 1]

Nigga I'm so out of your reach
You know it & you probably want beef, got you grinding your teeth
Got the finest lil freaks
Cause everywhere we go, they know that we the flyest low-key
Got that fire on me
Your scent is kinda quiet, loud like a silencer
Sheriff got his eye on Police
Pigs be patrolling, blowing while I'm strolling
Homie I'm a Phony OG
Bringing you that real, something you can feel
Thats how your shorty probably know me
If she can't spit a rap verse, than she probably gone sing
She a microphone fiend
I swear that she can rock it so good that I probably won't beat
You massaging her feet
She kiss you & you swallow my seeds, say goodbye to your queen, cause your..

[Hook]

Shorty want me

She wanna put that body on, wanna put that body on

[Verse 2]

They say rappers always rapping about taking your women

Think they yours & that they faithful, you mistake them for women
Then they're all up in our faces everything places that we visit
From the D, to the Go
Houston back to New York
Carolina, Toronto, California, Atlanta
You were keen to buy the ring you should be grateful you didn't
All my G's agree with me cause they relate to the feeling & they know
Hit it & the number ain't a day old
Just a swanky nigga hey what can I say though?
Smoked a blunt & busted now we both are KO'd
If we get busted its ok though
Because your nigga probably know me
His speakers bumping Dyme-A OD should be proud of your freak
Cause some how she know D
She blessed me from the crown on my head, to the soles on my feet, cause your...
