Ay
Yea
Say, what up?
(I'm so sick)
Ay scream what these niggas got on?

I'm in a spaceship out in space
I call the whip Apollo
My swaggers on the moon
In an 08 Marshalago
Now you think that you got swag
Cause you went and bought a bag
But Gucci don't make that
And Louie don't make that
Now I'm looking at your back
Like what the hell is that?
Like man that can't be real
But if it is then take it back
Cause they got you
Sick of you I'm like Ah-Chu

I'm so sick
So sick
So sick
So sick
In my wrist
In my fitted
In my whip
With my bitch
I'm so sick (We sick of you) [x4]

In the middle of the mall
Like shawty please don't do it
That shit is way too big
Thats not dimamond that is cubic
80 dollars for the chains
Thought I wouldn't do it
They gon tear up in a day
And boy you gon look stupid
Boy them cannot be Pradas
100 dollars they got ya, (Soft tacos)
You went and bought that fitted
You just wasted all your guapo, (Guapo)
Looking at my wrist
But I bet it ain't Movado

I'm so sick
So sick
So sick
So sick
In my wrist
In my fitted
In my whip
With my bitch
I'm so sick (We sick of you) [x4]

She thinks that she's the dime
Cause you told he she's the one
Her nails look good
But her toes not done
Got a 60 dollar hair-do, (Hair-do)
And a 50 dollar tattoo
Sick of you, (Ah-Chu)
Got a tongue ring for free
She won't put that tongue on me
She can put that tongue on you
You can kiss that shit for free
Got that outfit from Rainbows, (Rainbows)
20 bucks for the Stilettos
Oh no!

I'm so sick
So sick
So sick
So sick
In my wrist
In my fitted
In my whip
With my bitch
I'm so sick (We sick of you) [x4]

When you woke up and
You thought that you could fool the world
You can fool a couple people
You can't fool the world
I'm a tell on you, (Tell on you)
Tell them say, (Tell them say)
I'm a snitch, (I'm a snitch)
That shit ain't real
You know it ain't real
Check your swag
Now check your Gucci shoes
And check your Louie bag
We sick of you
We sick of you, (We sick of you) [x4]
Goodbye

Now take that monkey shit off
You embarrassing us
Take that monkey shit off
You embarrassing us, [x2]

We sick of you. [x2]
