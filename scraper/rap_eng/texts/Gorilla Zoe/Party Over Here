[Verse 1: Gorilla Zoe]
Say that pussy nigga don't like me
Bet that pussy nigga won't try me (nah)
If he do, they'll be pickin' up his body (yeah)
Have to hook him up to an IV (go!)
Guess he mad cause he seein' all the money fly 'round
Hoes shakin' ass got the cash on the ground
Need no glass, Rose by the round
Party after party, yeah we condo bound
King Kong shorty, this an iced out crown
Thunderstorm baby let it rain 'til they drown
Pussy nigga mad see him out here with a frown
And know about the spaz, bitch it's about to go down

[Hook]
See it's a party over here
And you're way over there
All the models over here, all the bottles over here
It's a party over here, fuck them niggas over there
It's a party over here
And you're way over there
Bangin' mommies over here, cause the money's over here
It's a party over here, fuck them niggas over there

[Verse 2: Gorilla Zoe]
Nigga you so lame it's a goddamn shame
Fake ass chain trying to spit your game
So lame, and your homeboys say
Got you lookin' over here, we will bust your brain
Don't play no game
Take a bitch to the whip, have her run a train
Have her doin' splits, lickin' clit, givin' brain
Should be off the chain, doin' freaky shit
Like some shit you read in (?)
Your wifey, you love her
She suck me, we fucked her
Don't trust her, I bust her
When I nutted, dog she drank it out the rubber

[Hook]
See it's a party over here
And you're way over there
All the models over here, all the bottles over here
It's a party over here, fuck them niggas over there
It's a party over here
And you're way over there
Bangin' mommies over here, cause the money's over here
It's a party over here, fuck them niggas over there

[Verse 3: Gorilla Zoe]
Baby you so bad, and it's a goddamn shame
That you way over there with that goddamn lame
So sad, and it's your goddamn fault
Cause the banks over here, I'm a goddamn boss
Bitch you must be jokin' just look at what he's smokin'
Now look at what we rollin', this shit is gold from Oakland
And all my niggas gangsta, we Gucci, Louie
I bet that boy's your fuckin' girl, I bust head ass wide open

Your wifey, you love her
She suck me, we fucked her
Don't trust her, I bust her
When I nutted, dog she drank it out the rubber

[Hook]
See it's a party over here
And you're way over there
All the models over here, all the bottles over here
It's a party over here, fuck them niggas over there
It's a party over here
And you're way over there
Bangin' mommies over here, cause the money's over here
It's a party over here, fuck them niggas over there
