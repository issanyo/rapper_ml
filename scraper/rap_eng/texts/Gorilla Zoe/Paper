It's Mr. Paper Worth, my pockets is my front desk
They bout to bust, so fo shawty I need more thread
I'm on an all carb diet, I want more bread
For the paper, I'll put 5 through your forehead
Copped 6 bricks on the quick, tryin’ to double up
4 glass pots cookin’ cain, watch it bubble up
One dolla short, fuck nigga, I'll damage ya
Real trap nigga, got keys like a janitor
Boyz in da hood, never hesitate to pull away
From bathroom money, we treat dough like it's toilet paper
Blow good kush, stay high like skyscrapers
Independent ballin’ baby, we don't even need a maker
