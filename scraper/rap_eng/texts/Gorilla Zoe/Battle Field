(feat. Block & Big Gee)

(Chorus:)
My Life's A Battle Field
You Can Catch Me On The Front Line
My Life's A Battle Field
On The Grind Ducking One-Time
My Life's A Battle Field
One False And You'll Die
I Don't Care How You Feel
You Don't Wanna See Me On The Battle Field

(Verse 1: Gorilla Zoe)
Life At The Zoo (Zoo) Thats The Battle Field
N***As In The Camp Starving
And I Ain't Trying To Miss A Meal
Tell Em How You Feel
Mad About A Record Deal
I Was Making Deals Way Before I Had A Deal
What It Is
My Partner Just Got Caught Up With Them Pills
Already On The Test They Tryna Give Him 12 Years
You Don't Wanna Talk That Murda Game
We Got Blood On Our Hands Block Boys
I Done Lost A Couple Brothas Mang

You Watchin Movies Thinking You Scarface Or Pablo
Put It On Your Cd And Count Your Lil Bar Codes
Get It Real Life Arizona By The Cargo
Battle Field Soldier Im Out Here Till The Box Close

(Chorus)

(Verse 2: Gorilla Zoe)
Spark Plugs, Screwdriver Had To Get The Car
10 Bricks In The 76' Skylark
Don't Look Back We'll Be Off By Unmarked
Part Hit The Curb Tire Bust In The Rim Spark
Blue Light, No Cops, Hop Out, Hop Box, Cut Cop
You Freeze, Who Me, I Can't Stop
Doowop Shake They A** Up Like Mook Blaylock
Telling Me To Stop
But I Dont Really Wanna Co-Op
I Drop, They Pop, Aiming With Them Red Dots
Folks Catch Me Now They Gonna Spread Me Like A Peacock
Battle Field Tryna Find The Whole Like A Red Fox
Me Against The World Now I'm Feeling Like 2Pac

(Chorus)

(Verse 3: Big Gee)
Its World War I Where I'm From That's Why My Mind Gone
World War Ii When I Shoot Get My Grind On
Vietnam War In The Car Glock Nine Home
World War Iii Up In Me Ima Time Bomb
Civil War Im Front Line My Mind Like Sherman
My Gat Like Ulysses Grant Them Bullets Keep Burnin
My Family Get Sick Of Me The Lessons I Ain't Learnin
I Give What I Eat And I Eat Cause I Hungry
My 9 Like Land Mine Action Like Columbine
Grab The Tech Virginia Tech All In The Day Time
I Told Ya Its Ova We Fold Ya F**K All Ya
And I Ain't So Soldier Im A Prisoner Of War (Edge Hanger)
