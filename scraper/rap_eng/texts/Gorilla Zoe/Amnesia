Verse 1
Should be in bed
Im in my head
Pacing the living room floor

I know that I
Could be happy instead
But I can not take anymore

A downward spiral I'm in
Binging Again
My friends are nowhere to be found
I'm in this labyrinth again
Just me and my sins
Picking my faith off the ground

Pre-Hook
I've been lost before
I've been found again
Knocking on heaven's door
They won't let me in

I push my thoughts aside
I won't remember them
I put the drugs inside
So I get lost again

Hook
And get amnesia (I just want to forget x2)
Amnesia
I just want to forget (x2)
Everything that I did
Amnesia

Verse2
I cheated, I cheated
Why in the fuck did I lie
Your heart was mistreated
I know I'm not that type of guy
I could of did better
Traded my soul for the cheddar
I could of did better
But I was not willing to settle
I wrote you this letter

Alonzo
Been waiting to have this little convo
Your mind your body and soul is under control
Like you was a console
You need an assist then I'm Rondo
I can't get you out of the condo
The whips, the bitches, the money, the game
Just serve as your personal blindfold
You got your eyes closed

Verse 3
Conscience to be on this
I been waiting for you to come start this
Talking to me like I'm heartless
Like I'm living life in the darkness
But I'm living life in the light
Dealing with shit that ain't right
Eve gave Adam the apple
How Imma not take a bite
