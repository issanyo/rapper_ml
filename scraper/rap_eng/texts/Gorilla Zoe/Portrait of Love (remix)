(feat. Yung Joc & Gorilla Zoe)

See you out the corner
Corner of my eye
When you walking by
I get an appetite
Wanna take your picture
Won't u strika a pose
Turn it into Ohhhh
Just wanna let u know

I think you're sexy
Baby won't u let me
Paint the prerfect picture of us
It's so electric (yeahhi)
Something classic
Make it everlasin'
It's gonna be incredible
Priceless
It can't be sold

Come and see the Portrait of Love (love, love, love)
This ain't the Mona Lisa
No Michael Angelo Picture
Come and see the Portrait of Love
This ain't no history sculpture
Just a love getting closer (Yeahhh)

No need to be scared
It's not unusual to want somebody
More than physically
Ohh Noo
U gotta play fair
I promise that I'll be the only one
To blow your mind and get you there

I think you're sexy
Baby won't u let me
Paint the prerfect picture of us
It's so electric (yeahhi)
Something classicMake it everlasin'
It's gonna be incredible
Priseless
It can't be sold

Come and see the Portrait of Love (love, love, love)
This ain't the Mona Lisa
No Michael Angelo Picture
Come and see the Portrait of Love
This ain't no history sculpture
Just a love getting closer (Yeahhh)

Come and see the Portrait of Love
This ain't the Mona Lisa
No Michael Angelo Picture
Come and see the Portrait of Love
This ain't no history sculpture
Just a love getting closer (Yeahhh)

What's the color of love?
Is it red
Or is it blue
The creation of love
Beatiful simply true (U U Uuu)

[Chorus x2]
No need to be scared
It's not unusual to want somebody
More than physically
Ohh Noo
U gotta play fair
Ooooo ohh
So fair
