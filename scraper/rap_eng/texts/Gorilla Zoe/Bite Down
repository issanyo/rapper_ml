[Chorus: Gorilla Zoe]
Me neither, I can't lie
I'm still in the club
Poppin' bottles with my niggas
Drinkin' liquor, smokin' bud
Shorty what it does
My nigga what it do
Pop a bean, bite down, do a line or two (do a line or two)

Get drunk (get drunk)
Do a line (do a line)
Pop a bean (pop a bean)
Bite down (bite down) [x5]

Get drunk (get drunk)
Do a line (do a line)
Pop a bean (pop a bean)
Bite down (bite down) [x5]

[Verse 1: Big Duke]
You know I fall up in the club
Throw'd and blowed as usual
Pocket's on swole
Better know we choosin' hoes
Only choosin' those
They hit the door and lose they clothes
Like to smoke dro
Pussy bigger then a tuba hole (hahaa)
I'm just bullshittin'
Doing shit how I usually do (yep)
Pay me no attention right now
I'm on a gram or two (damn)
My words might be slurred (slurred)
Vision's slightly blurred (blurred)
Swangin' down Glenwood I bang my rims against the curb (what the f**k)
Pissed off, ticked off, cussin', lookin' at the sky
I ain't mad about the rims
I'm mad cause I've blown my high (my high)
And then I ask myself, what type of guy am I
I got some issues to address, this I cannot lie

[Chorus: Gorilla Zoe]
Me neither, I can't lie
I'm still in the club
Poppin' bottles with my niggas
Drinkin' liquor, smokin' bud
Shorty what it does
My nigga what it do
Pop a bean, bite down, do a line or two (do a line or two)

Get drunk (get drunk)
Do a line (do a line)
Pop a bean (pop a bean)
Bite down (bite down) [x4]
Bite down

Get drunk (get drunk)
Do a line (do a line)
Pop a bean (pop a bean)
Bite down (bite down) [x5]

[Verse 2: Big Gee]
I'm f**ked up now I'm leanin, see my hat bent (bent)
On a purple bean feeling like the president (ja)
Im drinkin' liquor straight (straight)
Cuz this god damn bean just won't stop boosting up my heart rate (ba boop ba boop ba boop)
And I can't go to sleep cuz I'm scared to (wha?)
I'm by myself in the blinds, playin peek a boo (boo)
TV on when I nap to fulfill me (me)
Reaching for the heat every time the floor squeek (pop)
F**k that stayin' high cuz I'm a hood nigga (hood nigga)
F**k somethin' to eat, god damn I feel good nigga! (good nigga)
Higher then a Gucci bag, Louie Vuitton stitchin'
Bitch I can't lie, eyes same color of booga tissue! (hey!)

[Chorus: Gorilla Zoe]
Me neither, I can't lie
I'm still in the club
Poppin' bottles with my niggas
Drinkin' liquor, smokin' bud
Shorty what it does
My nigga what it do
Pop a bean, bite down, do a line or two

Get drunk (get drunk)
Do a line (do a line)
Pop a bean (pop a bean)
Bite down (bite down) [x4]
Bite down

Get drunk (get drunk)
Do a line (do a line)
Pop a bean (pop a bean)
Bite down (bite down) [x5]

[Verse 3: Gorilla Zoe]
Roll, roll, roll, roll (roll, roll, roll, roll)
Shawty I'm rollin' (rollin)
Bag full of dro and we keep on smokin' (smokin)
Bottles keep poppin', ice still glowin' (glowin)
Room downtown so the hoes they go
My eyes half way closed, I'm fallin' off my pivot (pivot)
I'm leanin' just a lil' bit, but the hoes, yea they dig it (dig it)
The booty yea I tip it (tip it)
Especially when I'm zooted (zooted)
I'm still on that fluid, (fluid)
And the money, we get to it (we get to it; lets go!)

[Chorus: Gorilla Zoe]
Get drunk (Get drunk)
Do a line (Do a line)
Pop a bean (Pop a bean)
Bite down (Bite down) [x4]
Bite down

Get drunk (Get drunk)
Do a line (Do a line)
Pop a bean (Pop a bean)
Bite down (Bite down) [x5]

Get drunk (Get drunk)
