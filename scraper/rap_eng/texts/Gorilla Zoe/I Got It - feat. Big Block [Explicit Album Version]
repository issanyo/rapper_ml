It ain't trickin' if you've got it and I got it
So bad I just wanna take a shot hit
(I got it)
Later on, hit the club and get it poppin'
Girl, I told you, it ain't trickin' if you got it

(I got it)
You got it
(I got it)
And I want it
So bad I wanna see you in the mornin'
(I got it)

So bad I wanna see you when you moanin'
You can have whatever you been wantin'
'Cause baby, I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it
'Cause baby, I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it

Hop up in the whip and get out of here
I can turn your wrist into a chandelier
You can go where I go, I go where you won't go
Trips to Acapulco, probably 'cause I got dough

Baby, I got game though, I am not a lame-o
Gucci, Gucci, Gucci, baby, come up out that rainbow
Swag to the left, to the right with me
And I can cover your body with L O V E

Fantasy fulfilled if you come with me
And I treat you to a lavish life of luxury
And it's just you and me
Wherever we go, all I know is we buyin' the store

And we spendin' the dough, tell me what's gonna break me
Receipt so long, man he thinkin' I'm crazy
If you were my baby, you could have anything, I got it
Just take a card out of my wallet

It ain't trickin' if you've got it and I got it
So bad I just wanna take a shot hit
(I got it)
Later on, hit the club and get it poppin'
Girl, I told you, it ain't trickin' if you got it

(I got it)
You got it
(I got it)
And I want it
So bad I wanna see you in the mornin'
(I got it)

So bad I wanna see you when you moanin'
You can have whatever you been wantin'
'Cause baby, I got it

Shorty got that good good, man, I've gotta have it
Ass so fat, man, I just wanna grab it
That's a bad habit, excuse my hand
I wanna kidnap you, baby, change of plans

Monday is Germany, Tuesday Japan
Wednesday is Italy, Thursday is France
Friday is Yacht day, you and all your friends
Chillin' on the coast of Puerto Rico with your man

It ain't trickin' if you've got it and I got it
So bad I just wanna take a shot hit
(I got it)
Later on, hit the club and get it poppin'
Girl, I told you, it ain't trickin' if you got it

(I got it)
You got it
(I got it)
And I want it
So bad I wanna see you in the mornin'
(I got it)

So bad I wanna see you when you moanin'
You can have whatever you been wantin'

It's all on you, tell me what it do
But you've gotta tell me before the night is through
It's all on you, tell me what it do
But you've gotta tell me before the night is through

I said my time is money and, baby, money is time
Baby, I've got money, I wanna make you mine
I said it's all on you, tell me what it do
But you've gotta tell me before the night is through
So I can upgrade you

It ain't trickin' if you've got it and I got it
So bad I just wanna take a shot hit
(I got it)
Later on, hit the club and get it poppin'
Girl, I told you, it ain't trickin' if you got it

(I got it)
You got it
(I got it)
And I want it
So bad I wanna see you in the mornin'
(I got it)

So bad I wanna see you when you moanin'
You can have whatever you been wantin'
'Cause baby, I got it, I got it , I got it, I got it
'Cause baby, I got it, I got it , I got it, I got it
'Cause baby, I got it
