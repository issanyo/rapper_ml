I spent a 50 on my bracelet (bracelet)
Another hundred on my necklace (necklace)
I'm leavin' skid marks, buckle up (buckle up)
It's 5, give 'em bubble guts (bubble guts)
Pepperoni, extra cheese, I got shit, I need a pamper (pamper)
The haters wanna taste it, tell 'em I might give 'em a sample (sample)
All you gotta do, nigga, is watch me ball
Diarrhea on you niggas like Niagara Falls
'Cause I know how to ball
I buy up the mall
We fuck all the broads
I pass 'em to my dogs
Writtin' some new names
Speedin' in the fast lane
Tryin' to dodge the chain gang
Traffic in the cocaine

If a bitch wanna choose to hollaâ€¦
My phone, but I bet I won't call her
But son I bet I won't kiss her
Is the funk & I bet you gonna miss her
You save 'em, I dismiss 'em
You love 'em, I just dis 'em
You eat 'em, I just shit 'em
It's like some from my picture
Now watch me break this picture
This pornographic photograph
Got your baby mama makin' pornos in a bubble bath
I thought she bathe our way
I got back to your place
'Cause baby I don't love you
Get the fuck up out my face

Pull up to the club like shit on my car
Shit on my rims, it shine like a star
Shit on the boy to the buy at the bar
Shit on the bar. Who you think you are?
Shit on my feet, mayn, shit on my wrist
Shit on your whip, mayn, shit on you bitch
Hatin' on me 'cause the shit I do
I'm shittin' on you like P.U
Pussy ass nigga talk shit about me bein' lame
In the bed who I tore IV
And I be layin' in the bed gettin' head from
You bitch like she like she ain't B
You shit on us? No we're shitin' on them

Since you ain't my kid he got no hands
