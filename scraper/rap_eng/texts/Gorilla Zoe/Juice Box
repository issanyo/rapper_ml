I make a Juice box wet, wet, wet, wet, wet, wet

I make a Juice box talk, talk, talk, talk, talk, talk
I make a juice box pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop

My eyes low
Chinky like Mr. Miyagi
Extra fresh, I'm drippin' in Issey Miyake's
Wax on, wax off like Karate kid
28's on tha chevy, ya know what it is
Me & my dogs hit the club like bam
The trunk be like wam
Them hoes be like damn
Walk up in the club, neighborhood superstars
Buyin up the bar, cushin' a cigar
A bitch on each arm, and both them hoes foreign
Menagin' widcha boy, tryna drink my unborn
Lickin' on each otha, acrobatics wid they tounge
Shake it like Beyonce, go ring the alarm
I make a Juice box wet, wet, wet, wet, wet, wet
I make a Juice box drip, drip, drip, drip, drip, drip
I make a Juice box talk, talk, talk, talk, talk, talk
I make a juice box pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop

I go hard
Hard like a rock
I pogo stick a bitch
Until she holla stop
The juice box wet
Drippin' like a model
Treat her like a rope
And tie her in a knot
Hood nigga shit meet me at the travelodge
Bring some redbulls and some Trojan extra large
Work a big chop, she gon lose a lot of carbs
Make that juice box talk, man I make that pussy fart
The girl can't win
Once I get it in
I turn her ass over
And make her back In
I beat it for an hour
Than I rest for 10
And grab another rubber
And do it all again
I make a Juice box wet, wet, wet, wet, wet, wet
I make a Juice box drip, drip, drip, drip, drip, drip
I make a Juice box talk, talk, talk, talk, talk, talk
I make a juice box pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop

Is it the way I say my name
The way I rock my chain
The way I walk into the club
Drive the hoes insane
I roll with hood figgas
Real niggas, money gettas
Fuck with us, ay choppa hit ya
Choppa split ya shit
Uh enough of all that
Tryna make a juice box wet fall back
Now whip it out what do u call that?
She got skin babygirl, haul ass
But I just follow the drip, follow the drip.. now
She's all on my dick, she's all on my dick.. wow
She's rockin' her hips, she's rockin' her hips.. pow
Now she's callin' it quits, callin' it quits..
I make a Juice box wet, wet, wet, wet, wet, wet
I make a Juice box drip, drip, drip, drip, drip, drip
I make a Juice box talk, talk, talk, talk, talk, talk
I make a juice box pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop
