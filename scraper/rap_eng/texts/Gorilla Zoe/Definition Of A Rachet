Only mess with er cuz you know I gotta have it

[Verse: Kurupt]
How do I define this bitch? Ratchet
Spit the goofy, try to do me, grip it up and grab it
Her hobby – jumpin on my dick like a rabbit
I call er little Lola cuz you know she gotta have it
This is how I step up in the function with the magic
Young Puff the magic dragon, I could fill a station wagon up with (nothing but the whoop)
Lookin for bitch
Bet you might know that fit this description
High off of that, medical prescription
Put my dick in, just so addicting
You, you, and you and you
You too, both of you
And you too, and you too
I bring it to you, wutchu wanna do?
And then you can do what you want (it’s all so ratchet)
Bomb head, country fair, lil bitch
Listen here, all I’m sayin, sip on the plain, I got her scream

[Verse: Gorilla Zoe]
When I walk up in the spot, watch all these ratchet hoes frontin
They at my table now, wheelchair stuntin
Hit a doggie, so we poppin bottles, now she love me
I don’t really know but she always call me buddy
She love the tats on my arms and my chest
Rubbin on me, getting too close, next
I don’t eat the kitty, I beat the kitty so stop askin
Just come screw me, I know you’re ratchet
Why you playin games? Girl I ain’t here to talk
I’m tryna marry that bitch… on chop
Call the cops, crime wash, couldn’t even help
And only bad chicks get to jump under my belt
And she from the city so she ain’t never lonely
She try to 143 but she splash a homie
Her phone’s off, don’t call back
From the party to the crib, she went all that (ratchet)

[Verse: Joe Moses]
Yea, look I do it for the ratchets
Beast in the bed, she a savage
Bitch I’m a boss, I be on my Meek Mill
If I pull that meat out she gon bust it in the grip
She a freak, no lame, met er at the spot
Your bitch sell dope and she drivin on the fly
Got a nigga with the Cola, brothers from the set
One call away, that bitch hit me with a text
The pussy on deck, scum of the scummy
Got a friend named Leslie but lil mama bummy
I seen er in the club, she bumming for a drink
Fuckin with the ballers, bitch what you think?
Bitch wait a minute, I ain’t even finished
This ain’t for you, this for my niggas
Bitch wait a minute, I ain’t even finished
This ain't for you, this for my niggas

[Verse: Snowoff]
Top drawn, sunset, sittin in traffic
Rollin up the kush, man you know I gotta have it
Bitch lookin at me, oh I look at this magget
Baby you can ride if you let em niggas grab it
Ratchet ratchet, girl yo ass ratchet
Then she ask me for some money, I say baby you can have it
Like girl I ain’t stuntin you, love em Laciana girls
Some mo ratchet girls pullin out in front of cameras
Girl you so ratchet I don’t know if I can handle you
She hopped up in the passenger and said she was a goggler
Then she started goggling, goggle mil, do your thing
5 minutes later she was duck duck swallowing
Hold on baby girl, this the end of the line
I gotta drop you off at the next stop sign
My homeboy came to the club with a dime
That same ratchet bitch, man that ratchet ho fine
Go, Zoe!
