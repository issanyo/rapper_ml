[Chorus: Gorilla Zoe]

I got my heat up high and my windows low
Geeked i dont know which way to go
Baby im so blowed, so blowed, baby im so blowed, so blowed
And if its me and my dogs we just ridin through the town
Checkin our traps makin our rounds
Gettin blowed, blowed, blowed

[Verse 1: Gorilla Zoe]

I wake up every mornin wit money on mind
Gucci on my body diamonds on my time
On the phone transcating heard that u ain't wasting mine
My time i hit the trap and get back on my grind
For a duce and a sprite in a stirofoam cup, purple kushin in my blunt
Smoke my newport to the but, wat u know
Wat you know bout dat ridin round smokin traxs while im droppin off
Them packs, gettin money in the streets man thats is not an obsticle
007 Mr. mission impossible
Man i got a vato whos got blocks of the blanco..and get em by the
Quatro but get em off pronto



[Chorus: Gorilla Zoe]

I got my heat up high and my windows low
Geeked i dont know which way to go
Baby im so blowed, so blowed, baby im so blowed, so blowed
And if its me and my dogs we just ridin through the town
Checkin our traps makin our rounds
Gettin blowed, blowed, blowed

[Verse 2: Gorilla Zoe]

Everyday im hustlin like the damn song, geeked up like look which
Planet should i land on, money dont grow on trees but shawty lumble on
Mr cut the check man u dont see the numbers off
I hear everytime they see i be sittin up high shades on my eyes everytime
I ride by so blow'd blow'd..
Hood like blik i ain't got shit else to do but get blow'd n get money til
My face turn blue.. yea the lawyers paid off where da case went to
I got a bitch on my side where her face went to..

[Chorus: Gorilla Zoe]

I got my heat up high and my windows low
Geeked i dont know which way to go
Baby im so blowed, so blowed, baby im so blowed, so blowed
And if its me and my dogs we just ridin through the town
Checkin our traps makin our rounds
Gettin blowed, blowed, blowed
