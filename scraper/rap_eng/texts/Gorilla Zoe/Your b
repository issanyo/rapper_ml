Your Bitch
Hey bubba you can't hate, i'm just gonna take yo bitch
You know she know i'm rich, she probably gonna let me in
Little lame ass nigga don't start, shouldn't never let me meet yo bitch
She came pronto straight to the condo, now she trying to stuff my dick in her jaw

So baby take them panties off
You bend it over imma break you off
And i don't know how it happened but this the playa anthem

(chorus)
When i say i'm fucking your bitch
I'm fucking your bitch
I'm fucking your bitch
Your bitch
Your b-i itch
I can't get her off my dick
And i know it makes you sick
When i say i'm fucking your bitch
Your bitch
Your bitch
Your b-i itch
Yeah i'm fucking your bitch

You treat your girl like shit, you left your girl at home
Now your girl's in the club with me, doing these shots of the patron
You head out she's gone, she ain't answering the phone
She's drunk shaking that ass, she say this her favorite song
That's yo girl i know you love her,know you trust her
But i bust her, let me fuck her out in public
Ain't no handcuffs i don't cuff it
I be drinking, ain't no budget
I spit the game, she dug it
Now she love letting me shove it
I love to let her suck it off

So baby take them panties off
You bend it over imma break you off
And i don't know how it happened but this the playa anthem

(chorus)
? if you hating it, can't happen
I get your bitch then we went and get it crackin
Man my money money so long
My pimpin pimpin so strong
I can talk a little fast, i can throw a little cash
And in the blink of an eye she gone
Get her drunk cause i pop bottles
Get her high as ali baba
Take your bitch like i'm a robber
If she ugly i don't bother
If she bad then i might holla
I'm a pimp, i pop no colla
Make your baby pop her booty, and i throw a couple dollars
That's all

So baby take them panties off
You bend it over imma break you off
And i don't know how it happened but this the playa anthem

(chorus)
