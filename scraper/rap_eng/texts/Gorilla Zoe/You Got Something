[Verse 1]
Your body is speaking [?]
Your lips preaching to the choir
You made the moves so right
Feel like menace when I'm dancing [?]
You feeling a way I know
Get you high
You ain't trying to come down
Got you open
You know I know

[Pre-Chorus]
She started for saying
"Boy, I usually don't do this"
Usually ain't a fool with it yeah
You getting money you cool with it yeah yeah
You got strings you can pull with it yeah yeah yeah
You got around fucking with you now now
