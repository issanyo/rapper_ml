[Intro: Yung Joc]
Cheri Dennis
J-O-C
I love you Cheri
Mama mi amor I adore
Let Joc give you the world & more
Purchase the blue's it you's of course
Or we could vacate somewhere off shore
Or we could stay home tonight
Tops & pop we gonna get it right
Dim them lights be my snack in the middle of the night, alright?

[Verse 1: Cheri Dennis]
See you at the corner
Corner of my eye
When you walking by
I get an appetite
Wanna take your picture
Won't you strike a pose
Turn it into oh
Just wanna let you know

[Pre-Hook]
I think you're sexy
Baby won't you let me
Paint the perfect picture of us
Its so electric yeah
Something classic
Make it everlasting
Its gonna be incredible
Priceless
It can't be sold

[Hook]
Come and see the portrait of love, love, love
This ain't the Mona Lisa
No Michelangelo picture
Come and see the portrait of love
This ain't no history sculpture
Just a love getting closer yeahhh

[Verse 2]
No need to be scared
Its not unusual to want somebody more than physically
Oh no
You gotta play fair
I promise that I'll be the only one
To blow your mind and get you there

[Pre-Hook]

[Hook 3x]

[Bridge]
The color of love
Is it red?
Or is it blue?
The creation of love
Beatiful, simply true

[Gorilla Zoe Verse]
Aight time to go
With a young OG baby that be Zoe
You ain't gotta tell what ya man don't know
Looking at me baby with ya eyes on glow
Spit no game I can see youu chose
A young hood playa you should lay on for
Can't buy love Cheri we both know
So we'll have a couple of drinks some good convo
Yeah

[Hook]

[Outro]
No need to be scared
Its not unusual to want somebody more than physically
Oh no
You gotta play fair
