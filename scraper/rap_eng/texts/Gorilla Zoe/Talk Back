She want that slum game
Want me to lie to her
So I told her that I love her like a God do
But I ain't eat it, I just beat it up

You would thought she was a slave
The way I treated her
I took the rubber off
Skeeted on her back

Same place where her man got his name at
Told her take a picture
Go & frame that
Bitches say that I'm a dog the way I treated cat

I make that pussy Talk Back like a rude child
Pop a pill oh man girls gone wild
Now to gear it on, bitch, grab a towel
Then go to soap, hit the shower

I make that pussy Talk Back, Back
Back, Back, Back, Back, Back

(I make that pussy Talk Back, Back
Back, Back, Back, Back, Back)

I make that pussy Talk Back, Back

I bet I'll make this pussy Talk Back)

(I'll make that pussy talk
I'll make that ass clap, like your voicemail, I can make it Talk Back
Nymphomaniac, shawty with them stacks
Grab a camcorder, so we can play it back
And you can lick on that
That's that liquid crack
And you can give me that
Because I'm a throw it back
Gotta eat somethin' this ain't Ramadan
I'm the princess
Queen of make you come
Go to sleep, suck your thumb
Wake you right back up with that yum yum
Now put your tongue on that bubble gum
You love my lady lumps?)

I make that pussy Talk Back, Back
Back, Back, Back, Back, Back
