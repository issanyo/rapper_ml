All the hoes jockin, beat steady knockin
Middle of the stage got the whole club rockin
Nigga you can hate but ya bitch steady watchin
Bet she can't do it on a dick, she poppin
We bottle poppin, you cock blockin
Told ya gurl you rap, but ya CD floppin
You say you gettin money man, we ain't seen nothin
Ya gurl is persistant, she ain't stoppin

(hook)
Man she say she want a hood nigga
I keep the purp by the pound
The trunk stay bumpin, yall know we run the town
Hood nigga
And i keep a bad bitch around
Thick bitch, long hair, yellow, white, red, brown
Hood nigga
And my chevy sittin on 24's
Flats look like flapjack, pancake you ain't know
Hood nigga
Im a play the game how it go
They can take me out the hood
But im a keep it hood folk

(verse 2)
And i dont need a scale for the work
I can eyeball purp, i am not you jerk
Hatin on me will make your situation worse
You dont wanna take a ride in that long black hearse
All eyes on me, shawty im a bomb first

Hustle mean hard work, hard work
If you scared go to church

The trunk stay bumpin, yall know we run the town
Hood nigga

Flats look like flapjack, pancake you ain't know
Hood nigga

They can take me out the hood
But im a keep it hood folk
Verse3
