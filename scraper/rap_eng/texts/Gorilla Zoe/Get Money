(feat. Lil' Wayne)

Let me do wat I came to did
I'm fuckin money cus I came with it
Fuck da rulers lil wayne 2 big
I luv da rumors it mean wayne 2 big
And I get brain like a anuriz-um
I'm da creme of da creme
I tend 2 offend
Da one of one
U can get shot by da son of a gun
If u snitch my purpose is 2 have your tung
And mail it 2 ya mom
Along with a bomb
Boom I'm
I'm so kadam
I'm so osam barak-obam
I ain't got no time if it ain't bout cake
Dats all I eat cus dats all I ate
And I keep a sweet tooth cus I got a tooth ache
A dab of cocaine to da pain rite away
Oops more den a dab say yo to da yay
Yo now I can't feel my face
Go and get da big wheels wet paint
And I act like my shit don't stank
Dat bank dat bank
Tell da bank I'm on my way
I'm on da highway gettin chased
I get it
And u best hide it
Cus if I spot it
I got it I got it
