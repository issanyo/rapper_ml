(Chorus)
My ex girlfriend called and said that she was over me
I told her I don't care cuz i got all these hoes all over me
I got tats all over me
I got ice all over me
I'm brushing off my body tryna get these hoes up off of me
Get off of me get off of me
Get these hoes up off of me
Im brushing off my body tryna get these hoes up off of me
Strong pack all over me
I got stacks all over me
I'm brushing off my body tryna get these hoes up off of me

(Verse 1)
The trap goin ham so i know the police watchin me
I got ranks all over me
Evidence all over me
Niggas know we run the streets
I know the robbers watchin me
Now i got to tote a strap to keep them folks up off of me
Get off of me get off of me

I bust her thirty minutes bust a nut now get up off of me
Took her to the mall told her get this money off of me
I walked into the Louis store to get this Gucci off of me

(Chorus)
My ex girlfriend called and said that she was over me
I told her i dont care cuz i got all these hoes all over me

(Verse 2)
My chain look like Minute Maid, lemonade and iced tea
Haters lookin thirsty like they wanna take it off of me
Get off of me, get off of me

That hundred round drum like a grill
Tell em bring da beef

These boys ain't got no game so mang, they tryna take it off of me
Man up thats yo girlfriend
Tell yo girl stop callin me
Textin me and stalkin me
Get yo girlfriend off of me

(Chorus)
My ex girlfriend called and said that she was over me

(Verse 3)
The door drop
Roof flock
Take this top up off of me
Murcielago lambo i can't get these hoes up off of me
Champagne top pop ros√© shit all over me
Treat her like a dog dog let her lick it off of me
I be in the hood dog the only place I 'pose to be
I went and bought a Phantom just to make these bitches notice me
Turnin up my radio to make sure that they know its me
Smokin on some purple tree
Droppin' off a half a ki

(Chorus)
My ex girlfriend called and said that she was over me
I told her i dont care cuz I got all these hoes all over me
I got tats all over me
I got ice all over me
I'm brushing off my body tryna get these hoes up off of me
Get off of me get off of me
Get these hoes up off of me
I'm brushing off my body tryna get these hoes up off of me
Strong pack all over me
I got stacks all over me
Im brushing off my body tryna get these hoes up off of me
