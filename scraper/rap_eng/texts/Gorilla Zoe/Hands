[Hook: Gorilla Zoe]
I'm talking hands, hands, before we use our hands
We don't do no talking, we just run up with them hands
Hands, hands, man, I'm talking hands
Shawty, rep your set, but you gotta use your hands
Hands, hands, swinging, throwing bows
Bumping at the corn, they gon' find you on the floor
I'm talking hands, hands, before I let you know
Block Boyz, Brick Squad, Waka Flocka, G Zoe, let's go

[Verse 1: Waka Flocka Flame]
Man, I'm tripping and I'm wilding and I'm buck, man, I'm crunk
If a nigga disrespect, we gon' beat his ass up
Got that chair behind, dog, I don't give a motherfuck
Blame Zoe, Blame Gucci 'cause I'm off the fucking chain
If a nigga disrespect, I'ma take his fucking chain
Disrespect him like a lame, man, you know what I claim
(Su-woo!) To the B gang
Man, I smell you, Piru, S.I.B. run this club
Throw them hands, you get dropped, watch your bitch suck me up
At the club, give me hug, homie, you got dropped
Take it to the parking lot, pop the trunk, that man got shot
Take it to the parking lot, pop the trunk, that man got shot

[Hook: Gorilla Zoe]
I'm talking hands, hands, before we use our hands
We don't do no talking, we just run up with them hands
Hands, hands, man, I'm talking hands
Shawty, rep your set, but you gotta use your hands
Hands, hands, swinging, throwing bows
Bumping at the corn, they gon' find you on the floor
I'm talking hands, hands, before I let you know
Block Boyz, Brick Squad, Waka Flocka, G Zoe, let's go

[Verse 2: Gorilla Zoe]
Get your jaw broke, get your head cracked
Get your back broke, get your neck snapped
Get your watch snatched, get your chain took
Get your ass beat, that's a bad look
Man, I don't even like these niggas
Fucking with my So Icey niggas
Make me wanna fight me a nigga
Four-four, I might light me a nigga
Pussy, pussy, you ain't no killer
You're so lame, I Gorilla
I go ham, lose my mind
Grab my nine and kill me a nigga
Motherfucker, fuck your gang
I fuck with Southside Flocka Flame
Icy ring, icy chain, Block Boyz and So Icey gang
Run your mouth? You a clown
223, fifty rounds
Fifty rounds will chop you down
Use my hands, it's going down

[Hook: Gorilla Zoe]
I'm talking hands, hands, before we use our hands
We don't do no talking, we just run up with them hands
Hands, hands, man, I'm talking hands
Shawty, rep your set, but you gotta use your hands
Hands, hands, swinging, throwing bows
Bumping at the corn, they gon' find you on the floor
I'm talking hands, hands, before I let you know
Block Boyz, Brick Squad, Waka Flocka, G Zoe, let's go

[Outro: Waka Flocka Flame]
Flocka, Waka, Waka, Flocka, Zoe, Waka, Flocka, Waka
Tay, Lex, Flocka, Waka, Waka, Waka, Waka, what?
Damn, what? Damn, what? Swing, swing, buck, buck
Waka, Flocka, Waka
Gorilla Zoe and Waka Flocka Flame
Gone
