I put them 24 inch forgiatos on that new ss camaro
It's 180 on the dash so when I mash I smash the pedal (vroom)
I'm gone I'm puttin on
I got them karats pointer stones all on my bentley breitling watch
That keep em watching all night long
Every time I raise my wrist
Every time we pop the Cris'
And sometimes I toast to much cuz I pop bottles in this bitch
When I stop drinking that Cris' that when I switch to Rose'
No way, a pear jue, green paper, St. Patrick's day
I got paper on top of paper it's in a backpack
I got checks on top of checks so I can check yo knapsack
All you niggas soundin silly
Everybody holla nilli
What's a milli if you can not count it
Man thats not the deali
Half a milli on my body from my necklace to bracelet
Spinnin charms, girls lookin text us
Ice gorilla, in they cages

But my conscious has no conscious
So my conscious spendin bunches
Well they say that I should work out
But I said fuck doin crunches
I just hunch a lot of hoes after them Benihana lunches
I got bitches that got mail
Pony hair, pony tail
And they're Lenox Mall shoppin

They have way to many fags

Baby backs up in my pockets

And there's no more wearin Nikes
Nope, no rockin them checks

Yes I rock Yves Saint Laurent
Man I met this little chicken and she asked me where I'm goin
I said blah blah blah blah blah
She said of course I wanna come
This bitch here she must be stupid got a ring off in her tongue
And her lip gloss is poppin
She must wants to give me gum
Let her hop up in the coupe
She wanna suck me til I cum
Bitch don't spit it out the window mess my paint up that'd be dumb
I said girl you better not spit it
She said mmm mmm mmmm
Then she swallowed and said yummy kinda tastes like bubble gum (stupid)
Stupid you so stupid (who so stupid)
