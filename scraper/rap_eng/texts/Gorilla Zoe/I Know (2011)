Downtown hustling weed and cd's
They knew that i could rap

Deep in they heart
They knew they couldn't hold me
God had a plan for little Z-O-E
Shawty wish she woulda gave me her number
I was broke back then
Now a nigga doing numbers
Same clothes everyday sleeping on the carpet
Now im sean johned down on the red carpet
Hahaha They knew that I was down bad
They say fuck em dont even front that boy a 50 sack
When I was fucked you didn't feel bad
The block cut me a check I heard you looking bad

You motherfuckers are like crabs in a bucket man. All ya'll niggas do is just sit back and do nothing. Talk about it forever, do something nigga buy a crib or something nigga

[Verse 2]
I wake up early
And stay up late
I can't stop, I won't stop
Shorty its too late
When I was young we shot ball into milk crates
Now we full court press on my own estate
We used to steal from when dissing when nothing to eat
Now you can catch me and my hand in these smell meats
I'm still in the hood, white tee, white ones, and the chevy strapped up like its fat like big buns
My phone going ham, niggas leaving stupid messages
But I ain't mad cuz the lord keep blessing this
He kept my mind right, took me through the storm
His soul clear patches nobody lay harm
