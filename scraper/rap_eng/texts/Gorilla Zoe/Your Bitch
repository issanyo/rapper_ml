[Intro: Gorilla Zoe]
Met this nigga right?
Had a bitch with him
Bitch ask me for an autograph
I wrote my number down
Called the bitch
Said the nigga be hatin' on me

[Verse 1: Gorilla Zoe]
Hey boy you can't hate
I'm just gon' take your bitch
You know she (on that rich)?
She probably gon' let me hit
Look lame ass nigga don't step
Should never let me meet your bitch
She came pronto, straight to the condo
Now she's trying to stuff my dick in her jaw

So baby take them panties off
You bend it over and I'm gon' break you off
And I don't know how it happened
But this a player's anthem

[Chorus]
When I say I'm fuckin' your bitch
I'm fuckin' your bitch
I'm fuckin' your bitch
Your bitch
Your b-i-itch
I can't get her off my dick
And I know it makes you sick
When I say I'm fuckin' your bitch
Your bitch
Your b-i-itch
Yeah, I'm fuckin' your bitch

[Verse 2: Gorilla Zoe]
You treat your girl like shit
You left your girl at home
Now your girl's at the club with me
Doin' shots of th'here Patron
You at the house, she gone
She ain't answerin' no phone
She drunk, she shakin' that ass
She say this her favorite song
That's your girl I know you love her
Know you trust her, but I bust her
Let me fuck her all in public
Came, no handcuffs I don't cuff it
I be trickin', ain't no budget
I spit the game, she dug it
Now she love to let me shove it
I love to let her suck it

So baby take them panties off
You bend it over and I'm gon' break you off
And I don't know how it happened
But this a player's anthem

[Chorus]
When I say I'm fuckin' your bitch
I'm fuckin' your bitch
I'm fuckin' your bitch
Your bitch
Your b-i-itch
I can't get her off my dick
And I know it makes you sick
When I say I'm fuckin' your bitch
Your bitch
Your b-i-itch
Yeah, I'm fuckin' your bitch

[Verse 3: Gorilla Zoe]
So if you hatin' it can happen
I can meet your bitch anywhere and get it crackin'
Man my money's so long, pimpin's so strong
I can talk it real fast, throw a lil' cash
Blink your eyes, she gone
Get her drunk 'cause I pop bottles
Get her high as Ali Baba
Take your bitch like I'm a robber
If she ugly, I don't bother
If she bad then I might holla
I'm a pimp, I'm a pop no collar
Make your baby pop her booty
And I throw a couple dollars
That's all...

So baby take them panties off
You bend it over and I'm gon' break you off
And I don't know how it happened
But this a player's anthem

[Chorus]
When I say I'm fuckin' your bitch
I'm fuckin' your bitch
I'm fuckin' your bitch
Your bitch
Your b-i-itch
I can't get her off my dick
And I know it makes you sick
When I say I'm fuckin' your bitch
Your bitch
Your b-i-itch
Yeah, I'm fuckin' your bitch
