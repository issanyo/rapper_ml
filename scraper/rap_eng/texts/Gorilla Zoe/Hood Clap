And if your Hood & you know it Clap your hands (clap clap)
If your Hood & you know it Clap your hands (clap clap) let's go!
Still gettin' money, spendin' money out of town
That sounds kinda funny. Ain't the banks closed down?
The stores closed down, the dealerships too
But we still ridin' clean everything's brand new
Never go broke nigga ain't nobody stressin'
I ain't never graduate I can't even spare a session
Only thing that I'm testin' is this new Camaro
My chain look like fruity pebbles

The whole world trippin' we ain't worried 'about nothin'
Still in the Hood gettin' money we stuntin'
If your Hood & you know it Clap your hands (clap clap)
If your Hood & you know it Clap your hands (clap clap)
Spent 2 on the shoes, spent 3 on the pants
You ain't even paid your rent, man your Hood Clap your hands
If your Hood & you know it Clap your hands (clap clap)
If your Hood & you know it Clap your hands (clap clap)

They say invest in stock, then go & buy some bonds
We infest in the block, we get it by the ton
Put a ring on her finger, now we put it in her tongue
You can call me Billy Clinton, call Lewinski ?
They steal Ore we steal them things
They fuck wit McCain, we sell cocaine
Nigga fuck George Bush, his daddy & his mama
I'm smokin' up obama while I'm countin' up these hundreds
Black trash bag like we finna do laundry
But it's full of money, Magic City Monday
When we leave the club she tell me put it in her tummy
You think we goin' broke? Man you niggas so funny

The whole world trippin' we ain't worried 'about nothin'
Still in the Hood gettin' money we stuntin'
If your Hood & your know it Clap your hands (clap clap)
If your Hood & your know it Clap your hands (clap clap)
Spent 2 on the shoes, spent 3 on the pants
You ain't even paid your rent, man your Hood Clap ya hands
If your Hood & you know it Clap your hands (clap clap)
If your Hood & you know it Clap your hands (clap clap)

Drive a different car every night, hit the bar every night
Ice shine so bright I'm like a star in the night
Say you better hide your wife, I can change your life tonight
Make her juice box wet, yeah the broad lay pipe
Yeah he ain't fuckin' none of these bitches like your celibate
She fuck with me 'cause I'm Hood & it's evident
I'm so hood I just ball for the hell of it
I smoke good by kush for the smell of it

The whole world trippin' we ain't worried 'about nothin'
Still in the Hood gettin' money we stuntin'
If your Hood & you know it Clap your hands (clap clap)
If your Hood & you know it Clap your hands (clap clap)
Spent 2 on the shoes, spent 3 on the pants
You ain't even paid your rent, man your Hood Clap your hands
If your Hood & you know it Clap your hands (clap clap)
If your Hood & you know it clap your hands (clap clap)

They say that I was too hood for MTV, or BET
So they can find me in a DC 6, just me & my bitch
That's a 9 millimeter, gettin' money, droppin' bricks
All I do is get money. What the fuck do you do?
Spend your time on MySpace? Waste your life on YouTube?
They just tryin' to be something that they not, my dear
There's a whole lot of lame ass niggas out here
I am not one, but I betcha I could spot one
Them lame ass niggas make me hit you with a shotgun
Tote tag, plastic bag, yellow tape to match
Out ridin' chalk lines, shawty it's a round

The whole world trippin' we ain't worried 'about nothin'
Still in the Hood gettin' money we stuntin'
If your Hood & you know it Clap your hands (clap clap)
If your Hood & you know it Clap your hands (clap clap)
Spent 2 on the shoes, spent 3 on the pants
You ain't even paid your rent, man your Hood Clap your hands
If your Hood & you know it Clap your hands (clap clap)
If your Hood & you know it Clap your hands (clap clap)

Let's go!
