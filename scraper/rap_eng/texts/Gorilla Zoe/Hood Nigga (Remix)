(feat. Young Jeezy)

[Verse 1:]
All the hoes jockin', beat steady knockin'
Middle of the stage got the whole club rockin'
Nigga you can hate but ya bitch steady watchin'
Bet she can't do it on a dick, she poppin'
We bottle poppin', you cock blockin'
Told ya girl you rap, but ya CD floppin'
You say you gettin' money man, we ain't seen nothin'
Ya girl is persistent, she ain't stoppin'

[Hook:]
Man she say she want a hood nigga
I keep the purp by the pound
The trunk stay bumpin', y'all know we run the town
**Hood Nigga**
And I keep a bad bitch around
Thick bitch, long hair, yellow, white, red, brown
**Hood Nigga**
And my Chevy sittin' on 24's
Flats look like flapjack, pancake you ain't know
**Hood Nigga**
I'm a play the game how it go
They can take me out the hood
But I'm a' keep it hood, folk
**Hood Nigga**

[Verse 2:]
And I don't need a scale for the work
I can eyeball purp, I am not you, jerk
Hatin' on me will make your situation worse
You don't wanna take a ride in that long black hearse
All eyes on me, shawty I'm a bomb first
I'm the truth and they say the truth hurts
Hustle mean hard work, hard work
If you scared go to church
Man this rap shit is easy, every beat I get I merc'

[Hook:]
Cause I'm a hood nigga
I keep the purp by the pound
The trunk stay bumpin', y'all know we run the town
**Hood Nigga**
And I keep a bad bitch around
Thick bitch, long hair, yellow, white, red, brown
**Hood Nigga**
And my Chevy sittin' on 24's
Flats look like flapjack, pancake you ain't know
**Hood Nigga**
I'm a play the game how it go
They can take me out the hood
But I'm a' keep it hood, folk

[Young Jeezy:]
Bitch whats happenin'
Known to get it crackin'
Heard bout 'cha already baby
You can stop the actin'
I said I'm drunker den a mu-fucker
Higher then a kite
Lost my mind and my cell phone in the same night
Talisa and [?] had on the same flight
Took 'em to the spot
Let 'em rock the same mic'
Bitch I ball er-day
You should have the same life
Stack so much green
But I still talk white
I'm in the Chevrolet today
Left the phantom at the house
Half a brick on the table
Half a mill in the couch
First off I'm a mu-fuckin' g
And I'll never let a bitch Lil' Bow Wow me

[Hook:]
Cause I'm a hood nigga
I keep the purp by the pound
The trunk stay bumpin', y'all know we run the town
**Hood Nigga**
And I keep a bad bitch around
Thick bitch, long hair, yellow, white, red, brown
**Hood Nigga**
And my Chevy sittin' on 24's
Flats look like flapjack, pancake you ain't know
**Hood Nigga**
I'm a play the game how it go
They can take me out the hood
But I'm a' keep it hood, folk

[Verse 4:]
Watchin' out for goldiggers like Kanye
But I will play Beyonce, or Ashantay
Make Keyshia Cole say she should've cheated if she eva' come my way
Get some head from Fantasia on the highway
Trickin' out Magic City every Monday
It ain't trickin' if you got it dats what I say, "You say?" I say and what I say goes

[Hook:]
Cause I'm a hood nigga
I keep the purp by the pound
The trunk stay bumpin', y'all know we run the town
**Hood Nigga**
And I keep a bad bitch around
Thick bitch, long hair, yellow, white, red, brown
**Hood Nigga**
And my Chevy sittin' on 24's
Flats look like flapjack, pancake you ain't know
**Hood Nigga**
I'm a play the game how it go
They can take me out the hood
But I'm a' keep it hood, folk

All the hoes jockin', beat steady knockin'
Middle of the stage got the whole club rockin'
Nigga you can hate but ya bitch steady watchin'
Bet she can't do it on a dick, she poppin'
