[Hook:]
We got bricks of the flake, Justin Timberlake
Last year was 24, this year is 28 (eight)
Ice everywhere, that's the icing on the cake
Wanna be a hood nigga, I can show you what it takes
(Money Man) Keep the tab, I call em Jackie Chan
(Money Man) Couple grand wrapped up in a rubber band
(Money Man) Glad lock and a scale on the stand
(Money Man) Hood Nigga, you can call me Money Man
(Money Man) Money Man, I blow it like a fan
(Money Man) Kush packs of that green alien
(Money Man) Fergalicious she's jumpin out the pan
(Money Man) Gorilla nigga you can call me Money Man

[Verse 1:]
Outside jelly, inside peanut butter
Paris Hilton in the trunk wrapped up in peanut butter
Up the highway and back again, droppin off that sack again
Can catch me on that I-10, gotta get the Benjamin's
Seventy- five (75), Eighty-five (85), Ninety-five (95), banana cream pies
I'm comin back from Florida
Wit Jeb Bush and his daughter
Money Man got dat work
If you need it, place an order

[Hook]

[Verse 2:]
Pack of beans, Sean John jeans
Fifty Grand Cast on my pockets just lean
Keep dat white girl Hillary, a pound of Bill Clinton
Getting Monica Lewinski, she's tryna drain my children
I'm makin', a killin'
I'm Ben Frank dealin'
I'mma Young George Jung, them boxes to the ceiling
I'm ballin, I'm chillin in da neighborhood dealing
I'm worth about a million got them boys catchin' feelings

[Hook]

[Verse 3:]
(What's money?)
