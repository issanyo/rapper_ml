[Intro]
Hey Shawt
Hello
What's up baby
Alright I got you, I got you

[Chorus]
Lil Shawty I love to stunt
I ride big trucks
We smoke big blunts
And spend big bucks

Lil Shawty my rims shined up (Rims shined up)
My ice is too (Ice is too)

Team yellow and red
And baby blue

Lil Shawt

[Verse 1]
Shawty she lookin
Shawty so fly
Could be a pimp
But shawty don't try
Shawty got game
Like lebron james
Call lou
Sawty untaimed
Shawt got money
Lil Shawty want change
Shawty ice chains
Boyfriends lame
Shawty ride trucks
Shawty switch lanes
Shawt DUI
Lil Shawty got dranks

Hey shawty what ya want
Tell me wat ya need
Shawty got the blunt
Girl I got the trees

Shawty ride benz
Shawty ride lamb
Real with ya self
Lil Shawty he the man
Shawty both hands
Cause it's a hood show dance

[Chorus]
Shawty I love to stunt
I ride big trucks
We smoke big blunts
And spend big bucks

Lil Shawty my rims shined up
My ice is too
Team yellow and red
And baby blues
Lil Shawty
