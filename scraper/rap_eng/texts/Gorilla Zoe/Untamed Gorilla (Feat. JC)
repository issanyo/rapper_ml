[Chorus: JC]
Yeah I'm an untamed Gorilla
Hit you wit a slug
No its 9mm
Find me in the projects straight hood nigga
Red beep beep
Yes sir I'm gonna hit 'em
I'm an untamed Gorilla
Yeah I make the chain do flips I'm a wizard
Real niggas say (Hey)
If you go throw money like confetti then let it rain

[Verse 1: Gorilla Zoe]
I'm 8 towns hannibal
Mother fuckin' cannibal
Untamed Gorilla bitch you should of fed the animal
See I been to hell and back
Sold weed, sold crack
Bust first, bust back
Fuck beef, whats that?
Kill them, shit to lose
Shit to prove
Whats the move?
Time to eat
Where's the food?
Barrel to the head
Bust a tooth
You know what a mad nigga gunna do
You know what a mad nigga been through
Now you don't want beef with you know who
Tell me what I do
Stay strapped and ball every night like fuck 'em
They ain't villas, they some hoes, dogg, and we don't love 'em
See the streets don't know 'em so the hood won't miss 'em
Niggas flirting with a killa, let the 4-5 kiss 'em
18 stacks and your ass knocked out
Another stack I'll have your body dropped off
Your head in a bag coming back to me
No fingers, no teeth, how they trackin' me

[Chorus: JC]
Yeah I'm an untamed Gorilla
Hit you wit a slug
No its 9mm
Find me in the projects straight hood nigga
Red beep beep
Yes sir I'm gonna hit 'em
I'm an untamed Gorilla
Yeah I make the chain do flips I'm a wizard
Real niggas say (Hey)
If you go throw money like confetti then let it rain

[Verse 2: Gorilla Zoe]
It's in my blood line
Gangsta nigga duckin' one time
I'm on the front line, Glock 9, Colombine
And my state of mind it's suicidal, fuck ya'll
And if they don't mark me first, then I'm a kill 'em all
Black John Gotti (John Gotti) Kamikaze (Kamikaze)
Hiroshima shit, block boys in the party
Where you gonna go? Straight to the park
There's someone's let you know, you already know
How you ride? (How you ride?)
Darth Vader on the ho, playa
Black Benz, black tint, black gator on the floor
Black jeans, black hat, black shoes to match
Try me and get smacked
Black Teflon gat

[Chorus: JC]
Yeah I'm an untamed Gorilla
Hit you wit a slug
No its 9mm
Find me in the projects straight hood nigga
Red beep beep
Yes sir I'm gonna hit 'em
I'm an untamed Gorilla
Yeah I make the chain do flips I'm a wizard
Real niggas say (Hey)
If you go throw money like confetti then let it rain
