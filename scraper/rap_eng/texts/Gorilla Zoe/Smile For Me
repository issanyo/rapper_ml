I'm not perfect, I'm just me
No, I can't pretend to be nobody else, I can only be me
If you don't like me, oh well
The time it takes to judge me, homeboy
Better judge yourself, yourself

I'm only human, yeah
I'm only human
We ain't perfect, no
No, we ain't perfect, no

I'm only human, yeah
I'm only human
And we ain't perfect, no
No, we ain't perfect, no

Talkin' 'bout this, they talk about that
They say that you're ugly, say that you're bad
Smile in your face to stab you in the back
You tryna do good, they say you do crap

They say you gotta be skinny, look so pretty
Image is the key to the goddamn city
I know the radio gon' beat this one
When I say that

'Cause I'm not perfect, I'm just me
No, I can't pretend to be nobody else, I can only be me
If you don't like me, oh well
The time it takes to judge me, homeboy
Better judge yourself, yourself

I'm only human, yeah
I'm only human
We ain't perfect, no
No, we ain't perfect, no

I'm only human, yeah
I'm only human
And we ain't perfect, no
No, we ain't perfect, no

Livin' your life, sometimes it ain't fair
Well, fuck what they like and tell them who cares?
The tables are turned like musical chairs
You can't make orange juice from squeezin' a pear

They laugh 'cause you're different, tell them they're corny
Think that you're weak but show them you're strong
So what if I'm right? So what if I'm wrong?
What if I can't finish lyrics to this goddamn song?

I'm not perfect, I'm just me
No, I can't pretend to be nobody else, I can only be me
If you don't like me, oh well
The time it takes to judge me, homeboy
Better judge yourself, yourself

I'm only human, yeah
I'm only human
We ain't perfect, no
No, we ain't perfect, no

I'm only human, yeah
I'm only human
And we ain't perfect, no
No, we ain't perfect, no

Say you got money, so what if I'm poor?
You only think I work at the store
So, so what, who cares what you got?
I'm still puttin' my food in my pot

So what if I was hungry, sleepin' on the curb?
What if I'm from the ghetto, what if I'm from the suburb?
What if I'm not cool? So what if I'm a nerd?
If I gave you advice, could I still be heard?

I'm not perfect, I'm just me
We ain't perfect, no
No, we ain't perfect, no
I'm only human
I'm only human
