[Verse 1: Gorilla Zoe]
I am Atlanta, no one above
I sup bubbly, my whip lovely
My wrist icy, chunky, crystal
Haters, say fuck 'em
Their bitches love me
Black and red, A-town vowels
AR-15, my hometown
Straight (?), shorty
Need no soda, when I say soda
Not talkin' cola
My neck is polar
I'm gone, solar
We're going on
I'm trying to tell you
On tour

[Chorus]
What goin 'on (what's goin' on?)
What goin' on (what's goin' on?)
I'm in that Chevy that cost way more than your home
What's goin' on? (what's goin' on?)
What's goin' on? (I'm puttin' on)
What's goin on?
We in the building, ay you know what's goin' on
What goin' on (what's goin' on?)
What goin' on (what's goin' on?)
Two bitches with me, and they pretty so it's on
What goin 'on (what's goin' on?)
What goin' on (what's goin' on?)
If I'm on in the city, then you know I'm goin' on

[Verse 2: Gorilla Zoe]
Fuck you
Pay me
Yeah that's the motto
If you gon' suck me
Bitch you must swallow
That AK shoot hollows
Hard shell, no tacos
Gorilla's the game now
Just call me Capo
Wells Fargo, I got dinero
Now everywhere I go
Is Georgia lotto
Pino Grigio, Merlot, Moscato
Drinking with my pull
Before I get the cargo

[Chorus]
What goin 'on (what's goin' on?)
What goin' on (what's goin' on?)
I'm in that Chevy that cost way more than your home
What's goin' on? (what's goin' on?)
What's goin' on? (I'm puttin' on)
What's goin on?
We in the building, ay you know what's goin' on
What goin' on (what's goin' on?)
What goin' on (what's goin' on?)
Two bitches with me, and they pretty so it's on
What goin 'on (what's goin' on?)
What goin' on (what's goin' on?)
If I'm on in the city, then you know I'm goin' on

[Verse 3: Gorilla Zoe]
I go foolish
Bitch I do this
D boys, brizzo
Cause they're clueless
Speakin' of Clueless, my life's a movie
American Gangster, shoutout - Tookie
Free Li-ttle Boosie
My shoes, Louie
Sippin' this Louie, my nickname should be Louie
But it's Murcielago, Lambo Zoe
In a spaceship, Apollo
Out of here

[Chorus]
What goin 'on (what's goin' on?)
What goin' on (what's goin' on?)
I'm in that Chevy that cost way more than your home
What's goin' on? (what's goin' on?)
What's goin' on? (I'm puttin' on)
What's goin on?
We in the building, ay you know what's goin' on
What goin' on (what's goin' on?)
What goin' on (what's goin' on?)
Two bitches with me, and they pretty so it's on
What goin 'on (what's goin' on?)
What goin' on (what's goin' on?)
If I'm on in the city, then you know I'm goin' on

I am Atlanta, no one above me
I sip bubbly, my whip lovely
I am Atlanta, no one above me
I sip bubbly, my whip lovely
