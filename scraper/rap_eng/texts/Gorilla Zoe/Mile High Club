[Intro]

[Hook]
You say ya man got a fountain
Boy I got a jet
You say he got money
Bitch I got a check
Know it sounds like a dream
This is real as it gets
Join the Mile High Club
Get that juicebox wet
And need to fly with me
Baby flow with me
Baby fly with me
Need to flow with me

[Verse 1]
I got money out the ass, out my cooler
I got money on my mind, my medulla
I got long money, baby grab a ruler
I got money on my wrist Franck Muller
Talkin’ ‘bout a watch
I got watches like a jeweler
So much ice
I am cool like a cooler
Yo girl jock me it’s like me & might lose her
She got good brain, I’ma use her, school her
Send her back to you, yeah I fooled her
Fooled ya!
You can take her shoppin’
You’re a trick
You’re a loser
Me, I’m in Miami on a yacht, like a cruise, brah
Shittin’ on these niggas, grab a pooper (scooper)

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
They see me gettin’ money so these pussy niggas whinin’
Why these niggas whinin’ when the Taco Bell is hirin’?
Rich, I’m just chillin, poppin codeine, sippin wine &
They ask what kind of wine
I say Chardonnay is fine
In the restaurant, “Excuse me? Could you hand me my furry coat?”
And baby could you see me where a G like me can smoke?
I know it sounds ugh, but don’t take it for a joke
See my dog is from the hood & he just wants some hen & coke
Pop the hood to Hollywood
So we just doing what we want
They bring me mad weed
So we rollin’ plenty blunts
I kick it with the movie stars
Nah, just the actresses
They know who we are, so we fuckin’ on their mattresses

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
These niggas is jockin’ jaws
These hoes is still jockin’ me
The money’s still coming
We got it jumpin’ like trampolines
Lookin’ up at the sky
Daddy’d be proud of me
I went to Dubai
They treat me like royalty
Is that how it’s supposed to be
Used to work in them factories
When now one of them deserting me bitches call me Your Majesty
Foreign
Foreign
I’ll be back when they game
Twenty thousand feet in the sky smokin’ Mary Jane
On my own plane
And I ain’t lyin’ mane
See the logo?
That Gorilla face…

[Hook]
