[Verse 1]
It was a cold winter day
I was chilling out by the pool, alright
Tryna figure out what to do
With my life
It seems like everything I do is wrong, right on time
So I'll just stuff my bong
And try to drink some wine
To ease my mind
Maybe everything'll be fine

[Hook]
I'm a day dreamer, living in a nightmare
I'm a day dreamer, wonder why we're all here
Day dreaming; high, so I don't care
I'm a day dreamer, my life is like a nightmare

[Verse 2]
I need rehab, I can't take it
Say I'm depressed, I don't see it
I'm in deep, now; damn near senile
All my problems, they stress me out

Find me so high, up in smoke clouds
Walk on the sky, blowing smoke out
Then I start thinking, then I start drinking
I can't walk in the AA meeting

Know I'm addicted, my mind is afflicted
When I can't kick it, I need a one-way ticket
Out of this town, out of this world
So I start dreaming, let my legs unfurl

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
I'm sick of my job, I'm sick of my boss
I'm sick of myself and I'm sick of my thoughts
I'm sick of this drink and I'm sick of this weed
It keeps me hurling, and down on my knees

Praying to the porcelain
Looking at the stall
Somebody wrote their name
And their number on the wall
That's when I blacked out
Either that, or I just passed out

That's when I start dreaming
About some shit I don't remember
But this ain't nothing new to me
Cause I'm a day dreamer
Fucked up

[Hook X 2]

Cause I'm a day dreamer
I'm a day dreamer
Cause I'm a day dreamer
I'm a day dreamer
