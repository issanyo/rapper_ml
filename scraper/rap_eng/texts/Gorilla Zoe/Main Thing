Now you the baddest thing I'm usin', baby
And if I do you proper, can you be my main thing?
Be my main thing, be my main thing
And if I do you proper, can you be my main thing?
Be my main thing

Baddest bitch in the club tonight
Freaky little thing, not wifey type
Apple bottom booty make me wanna bite
Pop bottles all night, I know what you like

Do a couple more shots of Patron
Skin tight jeans, how you put 'em on?
Now 'bout all me she's puttin' on
My eyes won't leave her alone

She got a spell on me
Her body's like magic
I just wanna grab it, girl

Girl, you the baddest thing I'm usin', baby
And if I do you proper, can you be my main thing?
Be my main thing, be my main thing
And if I do you proper, can you be my main thing?
Be my main thing

Can't help myself, I'm watchin' you
And all the freaky things you do
She's super bad, make lovin' you
Make me rain my revenue

Like a drug I want some more
Drop that thing down to the floor
Take it there, girl, we can go
Pick it up and roll it slow

She got a spell on me
Her body's like magic
I just wanna grab it, girl

Girl, you the baddest thing I'm usin', baby
And if I do you proper, can you be my main thing?
Be my main thing, be my main thing
And if I do you proper, can you be my main thing?
Be my main thing

Breakin' it down to the beat
The way she move is so unique
I can tell that she's a freak
'Cause her boutique match her physique

Party hard, don't have a care
Lights are flashin' everywhere
Love the way she swings her hair
The way she teases me, ain't fair

She got a spell on me
Her body's like magic
I just wanna grab it, girl

Girl, you the baddest thing I'm usin', baby
And if I do you proper, can you be my main thing?
Be my main thing, be my main thing
And if I do you proper, can you be my main thing?
Be my main thing

She's the type of girl that makes you feel like you're a star
She's the type of girl that don't care 'bout your car or who you are
She's sophisticated, classy but she's sassy after dark
If you feel like you're that type of girl then meet me at the bar

She got a spell on me
Her body's like magic
I just wanna grab it, girl

Girl, you the baddest thing I'm usin', baby
And if I do you proper, can you be my main thing?
Be my main thing, be my main thing
And if I do you proper, can you be my main thing?
Be my main thing
