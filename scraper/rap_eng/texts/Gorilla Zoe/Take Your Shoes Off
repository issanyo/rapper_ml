Gorilla 'round my neck, gorilla in the trunk
20 on my wrist, 40 on the dunk

Gettin' money lil shorty brought E-N-T (yeah)

[Verse 2: Yung Joc]
When it's cold outside keep the ostrich seats heated
[?]
Oh yeah, one thing you gon' have to get
A fitted with the first letter of the alphabet (EYY)

Got a 442 with the flow master pipes
I draw attention, like I'm Picasso
26, big wheels, damn that's colasso
Fresh button flip screens, I know you see it
Fish bowl high beams, I know you see it
[?] on ice cream, I know you see it
When I pull up ya hoe scream, I know you see it

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Gorilla Zoe]
I wake up in the mornin' still drunk from last night
The Chevy catch flight like a multi-colored kite

Say she only like girls, me too, we both dykes
Mink on my back (back) mink on the seats
Mink on the floor take the shoes off ya feet
The whip go topless my Chevy's a stripper
Got another just like her I'm in love with sisters
454 all chrome goin A-WAL
Igloo AC, blowin' snowballs
Step in the light, my rims don't pause
Bedford on the break I had to take my shoes off

[Chorus]
