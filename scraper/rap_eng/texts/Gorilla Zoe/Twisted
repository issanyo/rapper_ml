[Intro: Lil Jon]
Yeah!
I need about 5 more Don Julio shots
Gorilla Zoe!

[Chorus]
In the club, getting twisted hit the floor if you with me
In the club, getting twisted hands up if you're with me
In the club, getting twisted hands up if you're with me
In the club, getting twisted, getting twisted, getting twisted

[Verse 1: Gorilla Zoe]
Ok, let's go
Shawty got her hands on ground and her ass on my face
Don't tell her my boy dranks on the face
Do another round 'bout to buy another case
Why ya in a rush? Say what your mama givin?
Maybe wanna meet your mama
Yah, got me throwin' money, baby girl let's rhumba
We can have a slumber party, hardy, drinks everywhere baby we gon' be tardy
Girl your ass is memorable, you should be a center fold
Got me stuck, I'm so caught up, on oc-to-pus no tentacles
Remind your ass how fine you is, tell your man how blind he is
Babe, that's it, rewind that shit, DJ might say rewind this bitch

[Chorus]
Dance, shake what's in your pants, do it with no hands
Or in the 3 point stance, get out of control
Make your booty roll, there's no stoppin', let's go
Put your hands on the floor, put your hands on the floor
In the club, getting twisted hit the floor if you with me
In the club, getting twisted hands up if you're with me
In the club, getting twisted hands up if you're with me
In the club, getting twisted, getting twisted, getting twisted

[Verse 2: Gorilla Zoe]
We getting twisted in the club, you tell me what's in your car
We got bottles off the bar, you got bud then roll it up
You got cash then throw a stack You got hands then throw it back
We got Rose motel, getting twisted that's a fact
Shots, we can do a couple, 2 more of those and I just might love her
Tell her bring a friend, we just might do it
You nasty girl, you look like trouble
No fan zone, don't let me bust your bubble
Bounce that bubble like r-r-r-rubble, eat it like supper
Wake up in the morning, blame it on the liquor
I was drunker than a motherfucker

[Chorus]
Dance, shake what's in your pants, do it with no hands
Or in the 3 point stance, get out of control
Make your booty roll, there's no stoppin', let's go
Put your hands on the floor, put your hands on the floor
In the club, getting twisted hit the floor if you with me
In the club, getting twisted hands up if you're with me
In the club, getting twisted hands up if you're with me
In the club, getting twisted, getting twisted, getting twisted
In the club, getting twisted hit the floor if you with me
In the club, getting twisted hands up if you're with me
In the club, getting twisted hands up if you're with me
In the club, getting twisted, getting twisted, getting twisted
Let's go, let's go
