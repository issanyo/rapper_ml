[Hook]:
I got a headache
And my ear aches
She fucks with me
Shawty cause you is a cheapskate
She callin' my phone,my phone
Tell yo girl to leave me alone,alone,alone
She wants to pay my light bill
And my phone bill
And my automobile
Tell her to chill
Stop callin my phone,my phone
Tell yo girl to leave me alone,alone
Tell yo girl to leave me lone

[Verse 1]
*67 doug she callin me blind
Tryna call a number back I dial *69
I was stalkin that bitch,dial *82
Try to E-mail,callin and she textin me too
Look up to binoculars,down the street,lookin at me
Takin pictures while i'm chillin i'm just smokin' my weed
I can't take it on that twitter and Facebook and this shit
On my myspace messagin' tell her to quit
She be right there at the stage when I be up in the club
Tryna get into my V.I.P to show me some love
And I try to turn my head when I see her crazy ass
But she be right beside me man I swear that bitch is fast

[Hook]

God damn,shawty is a bug a bo
I wish I never fucked her and I wished that she still fuck with yo
Theirs the bitch,she so worried so
She wanna chew a nigga up like i'm some bubblegum
I'm findin letters on my doorstep,letters in my mailbox
Letters in my E-Mail,tell that ravin' bitch to stop
She just wanna conversate,I don't even wanna take
I wish I was a pirate on the plank I tell her take a walk
It might not really be her fault,cause I ball like mushroom fall
Bitches go for ballas when they kiss thats what they momma taught
That is justa damn shame,this is not a ball game
If it was I shoot off in a hole like Lebron James

[Hook]

Hi this is Tiger,you should stop calling him
Meet me at the golf course my golf club is peladian
I put it off with tiger and I got him in trouble
Now his wife is so annoyed she told his wife their a couple
Talkin Hollywood acts magazines in here
Trouble that I got him here stalkin' Dad's girlfriend
Thinkin that she special she be fuckin doin bad  biz
Carbon jam pussy need to throw it in a trash can

[Hook]
