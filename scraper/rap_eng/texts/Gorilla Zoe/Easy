[Intro]
RIP to Eazy, I'm [?]
My bitches, they get broke it ain't no problem cause it's easy

[Bridge]
I'm spendin' money easy, like I don't really need it
The wind blowin' through it, boy make ya look so easy
A hundred bottles easy
Rollie shinin' easy
Dollars on the dime, she gon' shake it for me easy

[Hook x2]
Ballin' like it's easy
Bugatti, Lamborghini
I throw it up, she take it all
We make this shit look easy

[Verse 1]
Fuck niggas gon' hate me but these strippers love me the most
Remember me in that old school but I pulled up in that Ghost
Only street nigga that traps shit, I jumped off of that porch
Now it's bamboo on Sunday and my nigga makin' that toast
And that rolex on glow, fifty bands I blow
You say you started off on that bottom bitch, but I really started off broke
And they prayin' all on my downfall, like "Where the fuck did he go?"
Tell 'em I'm a [?] millionaire, nigga you ain't even know it
Go!

[Bridge]

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Yo main bitch my side ho, we fuck ya bitch by 2
The whole crew done ran through
Bitch ain't shit special 'bout you
[?], that's real money we threw
Spend a hundred bands on Big K.O.D, they like what the fuck did they do
Spend a hundred bands on my crew, two seater no roof
Got a bad bitch in my passenger and I swear to god is she loose
We ridin' round with that [?], Ben Franklin that truth
My left pocket a fed case but fuck nigga need proof

[Hook]

[Bridge]

[Verse 3]
Niggas watchin' my pocket, bitches all on my dick
Throw ten thousand in ten minutes, that's how you get a bitch wet
I'm ridin' 'round with that sack, that bag nigga that check
I pull up at that stop light, these hoes breakin' their necks
For a UFO or [?] gold, that's two things I ain't met
That money all on that table nigga, I roll the dice and I bet
Said scared money don't make money, you niggas ain't rich yet
And I move weight like Schwarzenegger, real nigga I flex
