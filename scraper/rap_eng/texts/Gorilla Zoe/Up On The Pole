Yo mayn, you ever been in the club
Seen that girl swingin' on that pole
Thinking to yourself how the fuck she do that shit
Ay, yo Zoe, holla at em

The way she works that pole
Got me growin' my dough
They way she works that pole
She drops it down low (low), she picks it up slow (slow), she's workin that pole
The way she works that pole
Makes me wanna go broke
They way she works that pole
She drops it down low (low), she picks it up slow (slow), she's workin that pole
Let's go

They watchin' us (us), but we don't really care (care)
We're standing over here throwin' money in the air (Yeah)
In the middle of the club blowin' purple marijuana (juana)
I'm lookin' at this bitch but she someone's baby-mama (ma-ma)
Spend some change on this hoe
Where'd she go, I don't know (know)
I'm a rein on this hoe (hoe)
Where'd she go, there she go
Like ay-yo (yo), I came to the club with a bank roll (roll)
I'm over here tryin' to spend some pesos (so)
So what you say, oh (oh)
Work, work, work, work, work, work, work that pole (let's go)
Many girls in the club going 'hand me god damn it'
I'd trick a couple grand if they could make me have sex

The way she works that pole
Got me growin' my dough
They way she works that pole (pole)
She drops it down low (low), she picks it up slow (slow), she's workin that pole
The way she works that pole
Makes me wanna go broke (broke)
They way she works that pole (pole)

Let's go

Searched around the club and I-I-I, I can't find this lady
I don't know where, I don't know why (why) why I want this lady
I don't know where she could be (uh-uh, uh-uh), my baby (yeah)
But I'm gonna find her, miss lady
Work, work, work, work, work, work that pole there

The way she works that pole
Got me growin' my dough
They way she works that pole
She drops it down low (low), she picks it up slow (slow), she's workin that pole
The way she works that pole
Makes me wanna go broke (broke)
They way she works that pole (pole)
She drops it down low (low), she picks it up slow (slow), she's workin that pole
Let's go

A whole lot of hoes and a whole lot of paper (paper)
A whole lot of ice equals up to all the haters (haters)
A whole lot of niggas standin' in this one corner (corner)
One bitch on the stage (stage), so who the fuck want her
I'm on her, I'm on a whole lot'a ones and Corona
I'm feelin' like
She probably wouldn't speak if I caught her on the corner
But I caught her in the club, perfect picture like the Mona

The way she works that pole
Got me growin' my dough
They way she works that pole
She drops it down low (low), she picks it up slow (slow), she's workin that pole
