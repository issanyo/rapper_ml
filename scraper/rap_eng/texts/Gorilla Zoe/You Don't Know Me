[VERSE 2: D.Woods]
See the cars that you drivin, the diamonds, they just see the shine
Not what's behind the man
Not what he stands for
Made up they mind when you walked in the door
Hear the words you sayin and they want more
Don't know hustle, don't know struggle
So you gotta lay it out before him
They don't understand you, No

[Gorilla Zoe:]
They don't see the grind, they only see the shine
Lookin for the light but the money got em blind
All we know is hustle, a life full of crime
Battlefield n****s we stay on the frontline (ATTEN-HUT)
Tarzan I'm just lookin for a Jane (Jane)
A little thug love try to take away the pain (pain)
Throw me a the box try to keep me in a frame (frame)
You lookin at a n***a like a n***a can't change

[Chorus: Gorilla Zoe]
I can tell by tha way that ya look at me
You think you know me

[D.Woods:] oh yeah

[Gorilla Zoe:]
But baby you don't know me, naw

[D.Woods:]
I kno you comin home late

[Gorilla Zoe:]

[Both:] AY but you don't understand me, No

[VERSE 3: Gorilla Zoe]
Kick it with a real G (G)
And you'll see (see)
There's a whole nother side of me
You feel me?
Gotta look deep inside
I'm like Heckel and Clyde
One man two lives, I'm confusin you right
Take a look in my eyes, you can look in my soul
Ain't no love in the streets so it left my heart cold
Before it's all ova and that big curtain close
It's more than meets the man, I'm jus here to let you kno

[Chorus: Gorilla Zoe]
I can tell by tha way that ya look at me
You think you know me

[D.Woods:]
Oh yeah

[Gorilla Zoe:]
But baby you don't know me, naw

[D.Woods:]
