The Louis bag, the Louis bag
The Louis hat, the Louis hat
The Louis rag, the Louis rag

[Gorilla Zoe:]
See you swagged today
But it's gone tomorrow
Where your swag at, huh?
I guess your swag is borrowed
They say diamonds are a girls best friend (best friend?)
Yeah, I just use 'em as a wrist band
Do these True Religion jeans make me Christian?
And are these Christian Dior's for a blind man

[Gorilla Zoe:]
'Cause they're so dark, I can't see y'all
A nigga need a flash light just to see y'all (yeah)
Turn my wrist into a flash light to see y'all (yeah)
And turn my watch into a glow ball, weed ball (let's go)

When I wear my watch
I can't help but notice
That it's time to shine
So I'm Mr. Focus
I'm lookin' for the rakes, I'm lookin' for the stakes
You got Stacks on Deck. Then where the money at?
Where the whips at? Where your bitches dog?
Stand & brace yourself, lookin' like a sick dog
So many hoes on my balls I can't get 'em off
So many cars in my garage I can't even ball
And we don't use cash no more, yeah
What you use is credit cards now
Okay, what else? Yeah it's bank cards now
Okay, what else? The bank calls us now
Let's go

[Yung Chris:]
Back from the future
Future lookin' gist
Swag so sick
I could've been a gypsy
Scarred from my neck, just like I was a pilot
Swag so sick, you would've swore I had a stylist
Your money showed up, but shit my money pilin'
Glowin' bands in the club, man I call that shit whylin'
Swaggajack a nigga, man that shit childish
I been had swag ever since I was a child. (Bitch)
These niggas lookin' sick, I guess they swag is missin' (it's lost)
You could call me for some Swag Assistance (right now)
All I ask is that you pay tuition (it's life)
And read the terms & conditions. (Go)
