[Intro: Gorilla Zoe]
Bite down
Shawty chewin' like a billygoat
Goin' crazy, dancin' on her tippy toes
And im smokin' on dat mistletoe
See me in the club all the girls be like there he go

[Hook: Gorilla zoe]
I'm dumb, I'm a dodo
Still in da hood and I work for da lolo
I'm dumb and I'm still in the ghetto
Everywhere I go I bet the girls take photos
Type a nigga stay fresh everyday
Spend a hundred on a ol' cheverolet
And I can't change my ways
I'm so hood man the hood loves me

[Verse1: Zoe]
Everywhere I go, the ho know me
Still wearing black we dont rock white tee
I represent the A, I do it for the hood
I'm still in the trap on the block born good
8's on ma chevy, purp in my blunt
Ma wrist out my window just so I could stunt
I got a 'lil money so I ask her what she want
Ten grand in the club out the bar just to front

[Hook: Zoe]
I'm dumb, I'm a dodo
Still in da hood and I work for da lolo
I'm dumb and I'm still in the ghetto
Everywhere I go I bet the girls take photos
Type a nigga stay fresh everyday
Spend a hundred on a ol' cheverolet
And I can't change my ways
I'm so hood man the hood loves me

[Verse2: Zoe]
Franklin' money I can spend
I can get it back, hit the trap and get it in
Big bank, lil' bank, I bet I'm goin' win
My bankroll dumband your pockets so slim
Thangs in my ear lookin' like a cup of gin
The girl wanna come, so I told her bring a friend
What happen after that? You already know
I pulled out the pole and they did the limbo

[Hook: Zoe]
I'm dumb, I'm a dodo
Still in da hood and I work for da lolo
I'm dumb and I'm still in the ghetto
Everywhere I go I bet the girls take photos
Type a nigga stay fresh everyday
Spend a hundred on a ol' cheverolet
And I can't change my ways
I'm so hood man the hood loves me

[Verse3: Zoe]
And I'm lookin' for a wife for the night
Styrofoam cup got the purple in my sprite
Bitch you can do that on me
I got five-thousand ones, shawty, that ain't free
Hel it might be, cheap popeyed three
Now the girls going ham up in V.I.P
I was on her, now I'm on her cousin
(Tell us what your rule), shawty, we don't love 'em

[Outro: Zoe]
Bite down
Shawty chewin' like a billygoat
Goin' crazy, dancin' on her tippy toes
And I'm smokin' on dat mistletoe
See me in the club all the girls be like there he go
