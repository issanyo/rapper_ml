Play-N-Skillz
(Chorus: SupaSTAAR)
Go on bob ya head, go on work your shoulder (x3)
Ladies in the club let me see ya bend it over
Now bend it over
Now head n shoulder (x16)

(SupaSTAAR)
Wipe my shirt, wipe my feet
Look at my eyes you can tell I'm geeked
That's that calm, I'm on that gone
I ain't going home till five in the morn
Cup of Ciroc, fresh bomb fade
Give your bitch my brush let her brush my wave
Ed Hardy shades, a thousand dollar jeans
Screaming Halle Berry to the girl of my dreams
They be like that nigga there got swag
They be like that nigga there act bad
They be like that nigga there too cool
LL SupaSTAAR too damn smooth
I do a little that, I do a little this
I wink a little eye, I blow a little kiss
Mr. Halle Berry, I'm an ex pill roller
Mr. Yes I sleep with your daughter

(Chorus)
Go on bob ya head, go on work your shoulder (x3)
Ladies in the club let me see ya bend it over
Now bend it over
Now head n shoulder now (x16)

(Gorilla Zoe)
See a bitch on a bitch, I turned out somebody's daughter
Told her treat her like Rosie, baby girl swallow
Polla-tickin got a pornographic flick'n
Got her body greased up like you was Church's fried chicken
Told her I was finger lickin I got chickens in the kitchen
First I get em then I whip em some of my ladies come up missin
Talkin birdies, talkin blocks, talkin bricks, talkin pigeons
My club love me all I gotta do is show to the club in a '76 Impala
SportsCenter shawty EA Sports baller
Doin the head n shoulder got her pickin up dollars
The bitch tryin to holla but I really won't call her

Go on bob ya head, go on work your shoulder (x3)
Ladies in the club let me see ya bend it over
Now bend it over
Now head n shoulder now (x16)

(Yung Joc)
Now work that head, shoulders, knees, toes
She know she looks good so she puttin on a show
She acting like she know me when I walk through the door
Doin that roley poley man she drop it to the floor
Like bim-bam, look back at it
Please excuse my hands, aww man I had to grab it
She rockin Louie Voutton heels, hundred dollar bills
Ice around my neck damn near gave her the chills
If I had to guess it, shawty independent
She got her own crib, wanna pay a visit
Knock knock who is it, time to get explicit
Let me get acquainted with that kitty, let me kiss it
Check my high q, I'm a brat pack maniac
Check the IQ, I guess the girls a braniac
She get it from her momma, and there ain't no changing that
Tats on her titty, yeah that's where I'm aiming at

(Chorus)
Go on bob ya head, go on work your shoulder (x3)
Ladies in the club let me see ya bend it over
Now bend it over
Now head n shoulder (x16)

(Ending: SupaSTAAR)
Now go head, then ya shoulder
Now go head, then ya shoulder
Now hit the Bobby, Bobby
Now go on Bobby, Bobby
Now hit the Bobby, Bobby
Now go on Bobby, Bobby
Now, frank, frank, frank, frank, frank, frank, frank
Now, frank, frank, frank, frank
Now go drop it to the ground, girl drop it to the ground
Girl drop it to the ground, girl drop it to the ground
