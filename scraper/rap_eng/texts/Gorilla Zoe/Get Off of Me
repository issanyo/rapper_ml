My ex girlfriend called and said that she was over me
I told her I don't care cause I got all these hoes all over me
I got tats all over me I got ice all over me
I'm brushing off my body tryna get these hoes up off of me
Get off of me get off of me get these hoes up off of me
I'm brushing off my body tryna get these hoes up off of me
Strong pack all over me, I got stacks all over me
I'm brushing off my body tryna get these hoes up off of me

[Verse 1: Gorilla Zoe]
The trap goin' HAM so I know the police watchin me
I got racks all over me
Evidence all over me
Niggas know we run the streets
I know the robbers watchin me
Now I got to tote a strap to keep them folks up off of me
Get off of me, get off of me

Haters lookin' thirsty like they wanna take it off of me
Get off of me, get off of me

That hundred round drum like a grill
Tell 'em bring the beef

Murcielago lambo, I can't get these hoes up off of me
Champagne top pop Rose shit all over me
Treat her like a dog dog let her lick it off of me
I be in the hood dog the only place I 'pose to be
I went and bought a Phantom just to make these bitches notice me
Turnin' up my radio to make sure that they know it's me
Smokin' on some purple tree
Droppin' off a half of key
