{*skit for the first 1:14 before the beat starts*}

[Gorilla Zoe]
Sip and skirt, trunk full of that work
Blowin cigarillos stuffed full of that purp'
Drunk, burp, shorty hit that muh'fucker
Bet that bitch convert (bet that bitch convert)
You don't like me... like what I say...
Fuck you I'ma say it anyway
I think your favorite rapper is a sissy
I thought he was a gangster, why they got him lookin pretty?
Tell them rainbow niggas to come and see me
I'll heavily cut ya, have your torso leaky
The only color I kill over is green
And over them white boys I'll rupture your spleen
See what I mean? Niggas is hoe believe me
Come and get these hollow tips, my bullets got coppertini

[Chorus: repeat 2X]
A whole lot of niggas talk a whole lotta shit
But when it goes down they ain't fin' to do shit
Do somethin, do somethin (DO ANYTHANG~!)
Do somethin, do somethin (I MEAN ANYTHANG~!)

[Gorilla Zoe]
Even if you're sellin samples make a profit
Hoe you ain't makin nuttin? Huh, fuck nigga stop it
If you got it why not go on and cop it
Talkin 'bout what you gon' do, nigga I think you poppin
Niggas talk a lot, but they ain't real doe
You bitch made nigga grab a dildo
Hundred round draw and lean back, do the limbo
You're playin games with Donkey Kong on Nintendo
I'm King Kong, silverback Congo
Call me Gorilla but my real name 'Lonzo
Runnin last set, 8 months and a fumble
Zoked you might be but big bro he head honcho

[Chorus]

[Gorilla Zoe]
Puff some ad-libs, and fuck a rap
I do it for my hood niggas in the fuckin trap
Who's the king now? You the king of who?
I'm a feral motherfucker, "Welcome to the Zoo"
This the third verse let's get to a conclusion
Image is a smokescreen, these rappers are illusions
(YEAH~!) There you go... I said it damn it
If you don't like, fuck ya nigga, go on do somethin to me
I ain't fazed so they so causin repercussions
Dropped on your ass, try to do some reconstruction
Killer for real gon' handle these niggas
The block is the Zoo and the world gon' feel us
These niggas can hate but these bitches gon' feel us
I'm king of the jungle they call me Gorilla

[Chorus]

Do somethin!
