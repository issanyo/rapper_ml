I'm not perfect, I'm just me
Not gonna pretend to be nobody else, I can only be me
If you don't like me, oh well
The time it takes to judge me homeboy you better judge yourself, yourself
I'm only human, yeah
I'm only human
We ain't perfect, no, no we ain't perfect, no
I'm only human, yeah
I'm only human
We ain't perfect, no, no we ain't perfect, no


They talk about this, they talk about that
They say that you're ugly, they say that you're fat
Smile to your face, then stab you in the back
You try do to good, they say that you do crap
They say you gotta be skinny, look so pretty
Image is the key to the goddamn city
Know the radio is gonna bleep this one when I say
F*ck that, f*ck

Cause I'm not perfect, I'm just me
Not gonna pretend to be nobody else, I can only be me
If you don't like me, oh well
The time it takes to judge me homeboy you better judge yourself, yourself
I'm only human, yeah
I'm only human
We ain't perfect, no, no we ain't perfect, no
I'm only human, yeah
I'm only human
We ain't perfect, no, no we ain't perfect, no


Living your life, sometimes it ain't fair
But fuck what they like, and tell them who cares
Tables are turned like musical chairs
You can't make orange juice from squeezing a pear
They laugh cause you're different, tell them they're clone
Think that you're weak, show them you're strong
So what if I'm right? So what if I'm wrong?
What if I can't finish lyrics to this goddamn song?

I'm not perfect, I'm just me
Not gonna pretend to be nobody else, I can only be me
If you don't like me, oh well
The time it takes to judge me homeboy you better judge yourself
I'm only human, yeah
I'm only human
We ain't perfect, no, no, we ain't perfect, no
I'm only human, yeah
I'm only human
We ain't perfect, no

Say you got money, so what if I'm poor?
You own the bank, I work at the store
So, so what? Who care's what you got?
I'm still puttin' my food in my pot
So what if I was hungry, sleepin' on the curb?
What if I'm from the ghetto? What if I'm from the suburbs?
What if I'm not cool? So what if I'm a nerd?
If I gave you advice, could I still be heard?

I'm not perfect, I'm just me
We ain't perfect, no
No we ain't perfect, no

I'm only human
I'm only human
