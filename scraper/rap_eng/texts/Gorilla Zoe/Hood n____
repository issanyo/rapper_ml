All the hoes jockin'
Beat steady knockin'
Middle of the stage got the whole club rockin'
Nigga' you can hate but your bitch steady watchin'
Bet she can't do it on the dick she poppin'
We bottle poppin', you cock blockin'
Told your girl you rap but ya cd floppin, say you get money
Man we ain't seen nothin', your girl is persistent she ain't stoppin'
Man she says she wants a hood nigga'
I keep the purp by the pound
The trunk stay bumpin'
Y'all kno we run the town
Hood nigga'
And iI keep a bad bitch around
Thick bitch long hair yellow white red brown
Hood nigga'
And my chevy sittin' on twenty-fours
Flatts look like flap jacks -pancakes- you ain't know
Hood nigga'
Im a play the game how it go
They can take me out the hood but im a keep the hood folk
And I dont need a scale for the work, I can eye-ball purp
I am not you jerk, hatin' on me will make your situation worse
You dont wanna take a ride in that long black hurse
All eyes on me shawty im a bomber first
Im the truth, and they say the truth hurts
Hustle me hard work, -hard work- if your scared go to church
Man this rap shit is easy every beat i get i merc
Cuz im a hood nigga'
I keep the purp by the pound
The trunk stay bumpin'
Y'all kno we run the town
Hood nigga'
And I keep a bad bitch around
Thick bitch long hair yellow white red brown
Hood nigga'-
And my chevy sittin' on twenty-fours
Flatts look like flap jacks -pancakes- you ain't know
Hood nigga'
Im a play the game how it go
They can take me out the hood but im a keep the hood folk
Get like you,naw, get like me
Eveesus we dont rock white tees
Classic capris, but knicks on my feet
Camo bathing apes, get a pair every week
Manashe 3, the gurls suck me to sleep
Z-O-E climax to the peak
I see you now you see me
You'll see I see you fuckin with me

Cuz im a hood nigga'
I keep the purp by the pound
The trunk stay bumpin'
Y'all kno we run the town
Hood nigga'
And I keep a bad bitch around
Thick bitch long hair yellow white red brown
Hood nigga'
And my chevy sittin' on twenty-fours
Flatts look like flap jacks -pancakes- you ain't know
Hood nigga'
Im a play the game how it go
They can take me out the hood but im a keep the hood folk
Watchin out for goldiggers like kanye, butIi will play beyonce,or ashantay
Maybe kieshia cole - said she should've cheated if she eva come my way
Get some head from fantasia on the highway, trickin' out majic city every monday
It ain't trickin' if you got it dats what I say, you say, I say and what I say goes
Cuz im a hood nigga'
I keep the purp by the pound
The trunk stay bumpin'
Y'all kno we run the town
Hood nigga'

Thick bitch long hair yellow white red brown
Hood nigga'

Flatts look like flap jacks -pancakes- you ain't know
Hood nigga'
Im a play the game how it go
They can take me out the hood but im a keep the hood folk
