All the girls jockin', beat steady knockin'
Middle of the stage got the whole club rockin'
Shawty, you can hate but ya girls steady watchin'
Bet she can't do it on a ****, she poppin'

We bottle poppin', you, you blockin'
Told ya girl you rap but ya cd floppin'
Say you gettin' money man, we ain't seen nothin'
Ya girl is persistent, she ain't stoppin'

Man, she say she want a hood figga
I keep the purp by the pound, the trunk stay bumpin'
Y'all know we run the town, hood figga
And I keep a bad chick around, thick chick
Long hair, yellow, white, red, brown, hood figga

And my Chevy sittin' on 24's, flats look like
Flapjack pancake you ain't know, hood figga
I'm a play the game how it go
They can take me out the hood
But I'ma keep it hood folk, hood figga

And I don't need a scale for the work
I can eyeball purp, I am not you jerk
Hatin' on me will make your situation worse
You don't wanna take a ride in that long black hearse

All eyes on me, shawty, I'm a bomb first
I'm the truth and they say the truth hurts
Hustle mean hard work, hard work if you scared go to church
Man, this rap stuff is easy, every beat I get I murk

'Cause I'm a hood figga
I keep the purp by the pound, the trunk stay bumpin'
Y'all know we run the town, hood figga
And I keep a bad chick around thick chick
Long hair, yellow, white, red, brown, hood figga

And my Chevy sittin' on 24's
Flats look like flapjack, pancake
You ain't know hood figga
I'm a play the game how it go
They can take me out the hood
But I'm a keep it hood folk, hood figga

Get like you, naw, get it like me
Eveesus we don't rock white tees
Classic caprice but knicks on my feet
Camo bathing apes, get a pair every week

Manasha 3, the girls **** me to sleep
Z O E climax to the peak
I C you naw you C me
You'll see I C you ****** with me

'Cause I'm a hood figga
I keep the purp by the pound, the trunk stay bumpin'
Y'all know we run the town, hood figga
And I keep a bad chick around, thick chick
Long hair, yellow, white, red, brown, hood figga

And my Chevy sittin' on 24's
Flats look like flapjack, pancake
You ain't know, hood figga
I'm a play the game how it go
They can take me out the hood
But I'm a keep it hood folk, hood figga

Watchin' out for gold diggers like Kanye
But I will play Beyonce or Ashanti
Maybe Kieshia Cole, said she should've cheated
If she eva come my way

Get some **** from Fantasia on the highway
Trickin' out Majic City every Monday
It ain't trickin' if you got it that's what I say
You say, I say and what I say goes

'Cause I'm a hood figga
I keep that purp by the pound, the trunk stay bumpin'
Y'all know we run the town, hood figga
And I keep a bad chick around, thick chick
Long hair, yellow, white red brown, hood figga

And my Chevy sittin' on 24's
Flats look like flapjacks
Pancakes you ain't know, hood figga
I'm gon' play the game how it goes
They can take me out the hood
But I'ma keep it hood folk, hood figga

All the girls jockin', beat steady knockin'
Middle of the stage got the whole club rockin'
What shawty? You can hate but ya girls steady watchin'
Bet she can't do it on a ****, she poppin'

Hood figga
