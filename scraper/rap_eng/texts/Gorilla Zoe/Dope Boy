You know what you need baby (I think she wants a Dope Boy)
You need a dope boy you feel me?
You need a nigga that get that money (she wants a Dope Boy)
Block ENT block boyz we over here man
Vito on the track she wants a dope boy, Let's go!

20's on the floor VV's in the chair
Hundreds in the safe cushions everywhere
Wake up in the morning like "What I'm gonna wear?"
I could hit the mall, that ain't really fair
Pull up to the mall in a black Murcielago
Rollers in the trunk but in the hoods a semi-auto
Clip full of hollow valet parked the car they don't want no problem
They know who I are, your fresh from head to toe
Pull a bitch & I'm gone, take her to the room then I drop her back at home
He ain't sellin' records I ain't ballin' everyday
Bitch I got work all I do is move the yay. (Let's Go)

[Chorus:] [x2]
We be in the hood all the bitches in the hood love the Dope Boy (Dope Boys)
The Dope Boys (Dope Boys)
It's all good all the bitches wanna do is fuck a Dope Boy (Dope Boy)
A Dope Boy (Dope Boy)
Let's go!

Bricks of the cracks call me Osama
Presidential kush call me Obama
Pull up to the trap trunk beatin' like thunder
Man I'm gettin' money, better watch your baby mama
Hey Ms. Hilary, can't be kin to me (No)
But I keep that white bitch on another level G
Hey Billy Clinton what you tryin' to sell me?
That's the same shit that my Mexican's mail me
1500 bills god damn that's a felony
Karats in my ears all the bitches wanna share me
John dear, take care of the grass, My dear let me take care of that ass
G Zoe G4 that's a Lear', Lamborghini threw it into 6th gear
(Next)Season's clothes they don't drop 'til next year
Young nigga old money Dope Boys over here. (Let's Go)

[Chorus:] [x2]
We be in the hood all the bitches in the hood love the Dope Boy (Dope Boys)
The Dope Boys (Dope Boys)
It's all good all the bitches wanna do is fuck a Dope Boy (Dope Boy)
A Dope Boy (Dope Boy)
Let's go!

Rap shine, I want one like Snoop say
So you can catch me up in Onyx every Tuesday
Styrofoam Cup you think I'm drinkin' pink Kool Aid
Karats round my neck lookin' like a bunch of lemonade
Doe Boy I been runnin' from the media
Stacks in my pocket thick like encyclopedias
Old money I get it I beat a block
Then throw it at them girls that like to lick the lollipop. (Let's Go)

[Chorus:] [x2]
We be in the hood all the bitches in the hood love the Dope Boy (Dope Boys)
The Dope Boys (Dope Boys)
It's all good all the bitches wanna do is fuck a Dope Boy (Dope Boy)
A Dope Boy (Dope Boy)
Let's go!
