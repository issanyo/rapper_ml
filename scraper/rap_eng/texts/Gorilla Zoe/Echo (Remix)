Echo
You did it to yourself
Now you're all by yourself
Acting like you hate me
I left because you made me

You played me to the left
Now there's nobody left
To hear your complaining
I'm gone and all you hearing is your own

Echo, e-e-echo
And I'm gone and you're all alone
Can't you hear the
Echo, e-e-echo?
No one to hear you
There's nobody near you

It started off great but who was to know
That love that is lost, cannot be let go?
You say it's my fault, okay, then I'll go
It's better to know
Now there's nobody to argue with

'Cause I'm not home
Don't care who you're with
Don't call my phone

Or did you forget
You know you're wrong?
I'm gone and you're all alone
Hearing your own damn

Echo, e-e-echo
And I'm gone and you're all alone
Can't you hear the
Echo, e-e-echo?
Nobody near you
There's no one to hear you

Disgusted with trust
I'll trust no one no more
Just went with the flow
Found myself on the floor

When you went away
All my pain went astray
Like it's a new day
Now I have no one to argue with

'Cause I'm not home
Don't care who you're with
Don't call my phone

Or did you forget?
You know you're wrong
I'm gone and you're all alone
Hearing your own, damn

Echo
Hearing your own, damn echo
No one is near you
No one can hear you
It's your own damn

Echo, e-e-echo
No one to hear you
There's nobody near you

All night long, I thought to myself
Why would I stay with you?
Realized that you were the one who had issues
So why would I miss you?

To argue with 'cause I'm not home
Don't care who you're with
Don't call my phone

Or did you forget?
You know you're wrong
I'm gone and you're all alone
Hearing your own damn

Echo
It's just you and your e-e-echo
It's just you and your
I hope you're talking alone

It's just you and your echo
It's just you and your e-e-echo
There's no one to hear you
There's nobody near you

Just your own damn echo
Your own damn e-e-echo
Echo, e-echo
Echo, e-e-echo, echo, e-echo

To argue with 'cause I'm not home
Don't care who you're with
Don't call my phone

Or did you forget?
You know you're wrong
I'm gone
