[Hook: Nav]
I can't trust no body, I'm feeling lonely
I wanna live like Sosa but feel like Tony
I swear the 6 feel like the Gaza
Smoke like a Rasta
It's just me and my partners
Trying to get our gwap up
And that's the mission, that's the mission
That's the mission, that's the mission (that's the mission)
That's the mission, that's the mission, that's the mission

[Verse 1: Nav]
Cut through the grapevine, my name been ringing bells
I got a little buzz but I'm still not doing well
I swear the 6 is full of demons, it's like I live in hell
Say you love me, better mean it
You lying I can tell
You pussy I can smell
Dissing, they say I'm dissing
These niggas phony
It's shots up no women no children, I feel like Tony
Can't trust niggas
I'm like fuck niggas
These my family
My cousin, he's sniffing coca
I wanna be Sosa

[Hook: Nav]
I can't trust no body, I'm feeling lonely
I wanna live like Sosa but feel like Tony
I swear the 6 feel like the Gaza
Smoke like a Rasta
It's just me and my partners
Trying to get our gwap up
And that's the mission, that's the mission
That's the mission, that's the mission (that's the mission)
That's the mission, that's the mission, that's the mission

[Verse 2: Nav]
I'm off that Tanqueray
Drinking and driving, just popped a xanny
I feel no way
Bitches ringing me down, I feel like Manny
Can't trust these bitches, fuck these bitches they can't do shit for me
I'm solo, moving slo mo, I smoke a lot of weed
No promo, don't need promo, cause I got the streets
Make your mind up, make your mind up
Had these niggas weak
Bitch I'm busting, for my niggas, cause they like family
And if you try me on a Thursday, you won't survive the week

[Hook: Nav]
I can't trust no body, I'm feeling lonely
I wanna live like Sosa but feel like Tony
I swear the 6 feel like the Gaza
Smoke like a Rasta
It's just me and my partners
Trying to get our gwap up
And that's the mission, that's the mission
That's the mission, that's the mission (that's the mission)
That's the mission, that's the mission, that's the mission

[Outro: Tony Montana]
You're all a bunch of fucking ass holes
You know why?
You don't have the guts to be what you wanna be
You need people like me
