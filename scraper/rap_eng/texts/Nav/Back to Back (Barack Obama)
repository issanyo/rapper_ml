[Trump]
"Equally with the President, he's probably the worst President in the history of our country"

[Intro]
Oh man
Oh man, oh man
Uhh, not again

[Verse 1: Alphacat]
I learned to lead from Mandela, you could never check me
Back to back like my terms in office, they couldn't get me
Back to back like two duelers that's bout to take ten paces
Back to back like Trump's divorces, I said it, now face it
Oh, thinks he's important because of his riches
When I look back I might be mad that I gave this attention
But it's weighing heavy on my conscience
And now here comes the man straight outta Wash't
I'm convinced that this man is straight insane
I should've let Univision host your debate
You gon' make me buy bottles for John McCain
You gon' make me go buy you a new toupee
I heard there's a pricetag on your back
I'd be more concerned where El Chapo's at
I'm not sure what it was that really made you mad
But you can't diss Mexicans and try to take that back
I mean, whoa!
Can't fool my country, man, they know what's up
I wrote this bars while Michelle gave me a shoulder rub
You'll make America better? I laugh so hard I'm crying
Mmm, oh my God, why you always lying?
See Trump's the type of dude that mocks the world's poor
But is the world poor or your soul poor?
I know that you're trying to get known more
But this the nonsense you got fired from The Apprentice for
Check it, right-wingers turn to slur-slingers
Yea, you're getting bodied by a left-winger
I'm not the kind of dude that's gon' be kind to dude
And shouts to Clinton, she's about to trump you
Make sure you ask him "what are those?"
Then tell that man to hit the road
He'll tell another one and then another one
The DJ Khaled of lies, here comes "another one"

[Hook]
I had two terms they went back to back
Yea, they went back to back
They'll ask if I can run again, back to back
Yea, they want me back to back

[Verse 2: Alphacat]
I don't want to hear about this ever again
Not even in the end when he don't even win
Not even when you tell me 'Bama tell him again
He'll say anything for press, but he hates Fox and Friends
Oh, his bias needs to stop
He don't see the whole picture call him "Petty Wap"
Winter's coming and your campaign's flying south
It's time to stop talking, you should watch your mouth
Please, the GOP hates you
They're like "G-O Please"
His tan is orange, just in time for Halloween
Please, but Orange ain't the New Black, you're not me
Please, he gon' fall off like his wig in the breeze
Somebody stop me
Been watching "Narcos", I'm feeling cocky
I'm probably going too hard, you're feeling trapped
Imma give you a break from these bars, kit-kat

[Hook]
I had two terms they went back to back
Woah, yea, they went back to back
They gon ask if I can run again back to back
You took shots at me now it's "tit for tat"
Got him!
