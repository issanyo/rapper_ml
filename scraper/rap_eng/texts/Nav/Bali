[Intro: Derek Wise]
Time to turn the heat up like it's Bali
Throwin' all these bands while we in Follies
Horseman on my emblem, but it's headless
Roof gone, now we drivin' down to Venice

[Chorus: 88Camino]
She so good at what she do, I might bust a move
Jaw been on a lock while I sprinkle molly rock
How come when I'm comin' down's the only time you need me?
How come when I'm poppin' is the only time you see me?
She so good at what she do, ain't no room for talkin'
Ain't no room for talkin', ain't no room for talkin'
Mixin' tinted liquor, I ain't fuckin' with no white shit
I don't trust an opp, so many photos that I cropped

[Verse 1: Derek Wise]
DNA, trappin' in my genes, yeah
Bought myself a pair of Balmain jeans, yeah
'Member when I traveled with that ball? Yeah
'Member when I sold them that rerock? Yeah
Mixing up that Raf with that Margiela
Walkin' past my ex, now she get jealous
Wait, hold on, had to put down on that 'Rari
Wait, hold on, did that VLONE like I'm Bari

[Verse 2: 88Camino]
Pull up on the plug, let him know I need a pint
Don't ask for a sip, no, I'm not sellin' lines
If she comin' to the crib then she knows that it's a pine ting
Hit it, then pass it to my slime
You try to dap me up after the show
No, no, no, no, no, no, no
You wanna sip my drink, yeah
You wanna do my blow
No, no, no, no, no, no, no

[Chorus: 88Camino]
She so good at what she do, I might bust a move
Jaw been on a lock while I sprinkle molly rock
How come when I'm comin' down's the only time you need me?
How come when I'm poppin' is the only time you see me?
She so good at what she do, ain't no room for talkin'
Ain't no room for talkin', ain't no room for talkin'
Mixin' tinted liquor, I ain't fuckin' with no white shit
I don't trust an opp, so many photos that I cropped

[Verse 3: NAV]
I just ordered two more, now I got three different watches
See my haters talkin', make sure that they watchin'
Real bosses listen, talking money when I'm talkin'
Outline you in chalk, Raf or Ricky, when I'm walkin'
Wylin' like I'm Stone Cold Steve, I fucked a bitch in Austin
Just pass me the rock, I don't know how much I pop
Dissin' Derek, that ain't wise, 88 bullets gon' drop him
Chicken in the pot, got your girl watchin' my cock
In New York I Milly Rock
My shooter tote a 30 he can't hide it in his sock
I am not a rapper, all these other rappers soft
They hoping I fall off
But bitch I'm at the top, I'm just a brown boy from the block

[Chorus: 88Camino]
She so good at what she do, I might bust a move
Jaw been on a lock while I sprinkle molly rock
How come when I'm comin' down's the only time you need me?
How come when I'm poppin' is the only time you see me?
She so good at what she do, ain't no room for talkin'
Ain't no room for talkin', ain't no room for talkin'
Mixin' tinted liquor, I ain't fuckin' with no white shit
I don't trust an opp, so many photos that I cropped
