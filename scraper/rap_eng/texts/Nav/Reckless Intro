[Verse 1]
We was hittin' lick after lick (what, lick)
Now I'm hittin' bitch after bitch
Fuck lockin' lips, I just blew that girl a kiss (mwah)
Skrr, skrr, lift my doors, then I dip (damn)
Blow a bag on all my outfits, drip after drip
She says she like my jeans, they got rip after rip
Money pilin' up like pancakes flip after flip
Just me and bucks at parties gettin' grip after grip
Now I'm made and my whole family can't stand me (they can't stand me)
Now I won't get on a plane without a Xanny (without a Xanny)
Now all of a sudden they say they miss me
If I lost it, they prolly be first to ditch me

[Chorus]
I know how to kill these rappers with no gun
But I still went halves with my shooter on a drum
The things I never had, destroy that shit for fun
I'm tweakin', if they pull me over might go on a run
I'm livin' reckless, coulda bought a car, I bought a necklace Yeah that girl is cool but I want the next bitch
I wasn't s'posed to make it, shit was unexpected
Feels like my time is runnin' out, so I been living reckless

[Verse 2]
Pull out every time, I can't have no kids (fuck that bitch)
Pull out foreigns, make them hate how I live (how I live)
Did half a song, I'm tryna finish this shit
But they just booked me, gotta party at LIV
I'm still fightin' demons from this shit that I did
I lined somebody for a couple pounds of some mid
I cried when Body said that he avoided his bid
Cause when I got a problem he the one that I hit
I know you really hate me, you act like you respect me
That ain't love, its really fear (I know you really fear me)
You see me at the party, catch 'em lookin' sideways
Watch me make 'em disappear (poof)

[Chorus]
I know how to kill these rappers with no gun
But I still went halves my shooter on a drum
The things I never had, destroy that shit for fun
I'm tweakin', if they pull me over might go on a run
I'm livin' reckless, coulda bought a car, I bought a necklace
Yeah that girl is cool but I want the next bitch
I wasn't s'posed to make it, shit was unexpected
Feels like my time is runnin' out, so I been living reckless
