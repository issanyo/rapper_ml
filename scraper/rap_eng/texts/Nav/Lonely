[Intro]
Said she scared to pop a pill
Girl, you know what's the deal
When you're hangin' with me
Tryna see if you for real
I heard you talk the talk
But will you take these Addys with me?
And you know I'm poppin' seals
I don't wanna drink the Sprite unless it's dirty
Now you know how I feel

[Hook: NAV]
Girl, I got what you need when you feelin' lonely
I got what you need when you feelin' lonely
I got what you need when you feelin' lonely
I got what you need when you feelin' lonely
I got what you need when you feelin' lonely

[Verse 1]
I got what you need, you feelin' lonely?
You ain't gotta pay, I got these Addys for free
Listen to my music and she think she know me
When I'm on the drugs, baby, that's the real me, yeah
Your boyfriend say he can't stand me
Cause every time you fuck you always creepin' on me
Like I work for Best Buy, got them tablets
Got the Addys and the mollies and the Perkys on me
Fuck your man, he ain't got nothin' on me
She say "You ain't got respect, you always nuttin' on me"
Girl, you shouldn't have come out here with me
If they pull me over, they gon' find somethin' on me

[Pre-Chorus]
Said she scared to pop a pill
Girl, you know what's the deal
When you're hangin' with me
Tryna see if you for real
I heard you talk the talk
But will you take these Addys with me?
And you know I'm poppin' seals
I don't wanna drink the Sprite unless it's dirty
Now you know how I feel

[Chorus]
Girl I got what you need when you feelin' lonely
I got what you need when you feelin' lonely
I got what you need when you feelin' lonely
I got what you need when you feelin' lonely
I got what you need when you feelin' lonely

[Verse 2]
Said she scared to pop a pill
Girl, you know what's the deal
When you're hangin' with me
We ain't gotta go nowhere
Open up my lil' box, I brought the party with me
And I always drive impaired
Always fuck bitches in pairs
I wanna fuck a bitch in Paris
Remember when they didn't care?
Now when they see me, bitches stare
I'm throwin' Xannys in the air
If she catch one in her mouth, she gon' be sleepin' on me
Ain't talkin' Gucci when I say I got them double G's on me
Look me in my eyes and pop another one with me
She try to challenge me, she overdosin', fuckin' 'round with me

[Pre-Chorus]
Said she scared to pop a pill
Girl, you know what's the deal
When you're hangin' with me
Tryna see if you for real
I heard you talk the talk
But will you take these Addys with me?
And you know I'm poppin' seals
I don't wanna drink the Sprite unless it's dirty
Now you know how I feel

[Chorus]
Girl, I got what you need when you feelin' lonely
I got what you need when you feelin' lonely
I got what you need when you feelin' lonely
I got what you need when you feelin' lonely
I got what you need when you feelin' lonely
