Boy just please don't get me started with these hoes
All the trends and all they care about is clothes
They wanna put us in a box, oh yeh for sho
They wanna talk shit, well let them talk a little mo
And when they done I wanna take these motherfuckers throats
I ain't fucking happy with the shit that I control
I wanna tell you every motherfucking thing I know
You can laugh about me, I'll just chill here with your hoe
Every song on soundcloud I just peep it and it's screaming
Y'all just like Syringe and y'all just really wanna be him
Y'all don't get the message, you don't even know the reason
But you can keep (tweeting) about him and suck his semen
Ghostie, Wolf & Eric Getting big it made me so proud
All the parents here they're like "son that shit is too loud"
Half of my homies, they ain't even got a hoe now
But we still pulling bitches off a show and then my soundcloud

I don't know what all the fuckers talking bout
Say that I can't make it but I'm gonna make it out
Just don't touch me bitch, I can make my own route
I'ma do every motherfucking thing to take, you out
Rest in peace to (?) that be my bro
I remember when he told me I would grow
To be a fucking rapper who could sell out every show
But i just wanted him to be the one see me blow

Shit was really crazy this year
Homies having beef I couldn't get my head clear
I don't know why y'all be fucking living out of fear
Everytime I think about this shit, I shed a tear

All them people Thought that all this would be (?)
Hell nah bitch that's why I roll with some demons
We got our own style, we don't copy when we see shit
I had to speak my mind, the only time I do a remix

Paint my nails black, and y'all thought that it was funny
Now when people do it, y'all be thinking they get money
They don't got shit, at least not as much as I got
Get your damn verse while the motherfucking stoves hot

I said get your damn verse while the motherfucking stoves hot
