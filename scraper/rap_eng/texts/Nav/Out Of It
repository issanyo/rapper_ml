[Hook: NAV]
Wanna' make this money or nah'
Nigga make your mind up
In the 6 blowing smoke somewhere is where you find us
Not a killer but I could get you lined up
Wanna try me or nah make your mind up
Nigga make your mind up
Nigga make your mind up
Nigga make your mind up
(Wanna make this money or nah' make your mind up)

[Verse 1: NAV]
These niggas is bitches, hitting my digits
Talking about chickens, smoking the loud
And selling the midget, these niggas ain't serious
Wanna make money, they never go get it
Even if I don't live, yeah
I front you that work and you couldn't flip it
That's none of your business, you better go get it
You better go find it, just gon' remind it
You owe me a sack, I call it slipping
Its like perfect timing, the 4 on his back
These niggas is killers, and niggas is dealers
But only on wax, so shoutout to Trouble cause' once you a snitch
You can't take that back, no

[Hook: NAV]
Wanna' make this money or nah'
Nigga make your mind up
In the 6 blowing smoke somewhere is where you find us
Not a killer but I could get you lined up
Wanna try me or nah make your mind up
Nigga make your mind up
(Started at the top and you niggas still trying to climb up)
Nigga make your mind up

[Verse 2: ForraLaugh]
Made my mind up sipping lean in the rain
Was too fast even faster than a train
Went somewhere i forgot made it rain
They call me Drip ForraLaugh with no pain
Had to kill my enemies wow
Had to deal with money ao woaw
Had to give no shits 'bout my haters 'cause they know I'm better ao woaw
Had to clean my mind aw woaw
Had to risk ao nah oa woaw
Had to spend my money on diamond rings cuban rings aw woaw
