[Chorus]
I remember being broke and down bad
Now I pay nothing for my sneakers 'cause I'm NAV
He can't get a feature so he mad
I ain't nothing like these rappers they won't last
I don't wanna call her now she sad
It's 'cause I'm getting money fucking bitches living fast
Every time I dress I'm popping tags
And every time I'm buying I'm paying cash

[Verse 1]
Mixing up designer I don't match
Yeah I'm dressed in Bathing Ape that you don't have
Remember she ain't want me now she make it clap
I just I just put 200 on the dash
I just walked in Neiman with them bands
I got $15,000 in my hand
I might spend $800 on a shirt (Gucci down)
I just spent $300 on some percs (Bring me down)
Smoking super cookies I might fly away (super loud)
Cash got mad because I smoke a zip a day (Out the pound)
Remember going crazy on a paper chase
Now we got Actavis and cash inside the safe
Get outta line and I'ma put you in your place
She said she love my music and she wanna see my face
He say he want a feature get this broke boy out my way
If you become a problem, make a call get you erased

[Chorus]
I remember being broke and down bad
Now I pay nothing for my sneakers 'cause I'm NAV
He can't get a feature so he mad
I ain't nothing like these rappers they won't last
I don't wanna call her now she sad
It's 'cause I'm getting money fucking bitches living fast
Every time I dress I'm popping tags
And every time I'm buying I'm paying cash

[Verse 2]
She only want me 'cause I'm NAV
Bagged your girl I didn't buy that bitch a bag (I ain't buyin' shit)
I don't want no bitch that's in the mix
She talk to all the rappers saying that and this
Every time I'm buying I'm paying cash
I just spent $5,000 on some Act'
I asked her if she wanna win
She see the XO on my back and now she in (see the XO, now she in)
Yeah I'm ballin' way above the rim
Threw her the keys and told her "Take it for a spin"
I'm worth a couple tickets trying to get these M's
I call my momma, said "We'll never be broke again"

[Chorus]
I remember being broke and down bad
Now I pay nothing for my sneakers 'cause I'm NAV
He can't get a feature so he mad
I ain't nothing like these rappers they won't last
I don't wanna call her now she sad
It's 'cause I'm getting money fucking bitches living fast
Every time I dress I'm popping tags
And every time I'm buying I'm paying cash
