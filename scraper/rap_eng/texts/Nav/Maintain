[Intro]
Oh, you think you're fancy now with that, uh
What is that on your wrist there, uh
That a Rolex?
(Git, git, git, git, git)

[Chorus: Belly]
Bust down, Rollie, Audemars, Plain Jane
Blow dank, pour drank, everyday same thing
(Same thing, same thing, same thing
Same thing, same thing, same thing)
'Cause we just out here tryna maintain
(Same thing, same thing, same thing
Same thing, same thing, same thing)
'Cause we just out here tryna maintain
Bust down, Rollie, Audemars, Plain Jane
Blow dank, pour drank, everyday same thing
(Same thing, same thing, same thing
Same thing, same thing, same thing)
'Cause we just out here tryna maintain
(Same thing, same thing, same thing
Same thing, same thing, same thing)
'Cause we just out here tryna-

[Verse 1: Belly]
Look, we all dealin' with the same pain
My dogs bleed from the same vein
Don't come around if you can't hang
I'm everything that you lames ain't
A little change can't change me
20 years with the same gang
20 years, no off days
No days off, and I maintain
Ballin' crazy with the hang time (Swish, swish)
Same time, way back before Maybachs (Skrrt, skrrt)
I swear I always had the same drive (Woo)
Pumpin' stuck off the mud (Mud)
Bucks pour up by the landslide (Bucks)
You ain't fly, you on standby (Standby)
I got something that you can't buy (Uh)
My older brother, call him rider man (Rider)
My little brother had the vitamins (Yeah)
My baby brother, he been spazzin' lately (Woo)
My mama happy, she been laughin' lately (Mama)
First class, two tones, my queen need two thrones (Mama)
Almost wound up in a group home (Yeah)
Who's this? New phone

[Chorus: Belly]
Bust down, Rollie, Audemars, Plain Jane
Blow dank, pour drank, everyday same thing
(Same thing, same thing, same thing, same thing)
'Cause we just out here tryna maintain
(Same thing, same thing, same thing
Same thing, same thing, same thing)
'Cause we just out here tryna maintain
Bust down, Rollie, Audemars, Plain Jane
Blow dank, pour drank, everyday same thing
(Same thing, same thing, same thing, same thing)
'Cause we just out here tryna maintain
(Same thing, same thing, same thing
Same thing, same thing, same thing)
'Cause we just out here tryna-

[Verse 2: NAV]
AP, bust down Rollie, Plain Jane
Me and Belly, XO, same team, same gang (Woah)
Let my nuts and my chain hang (Woah)
In the Mulsanne havin' mood swings
30 millimeters ain't nothing
Watch how my wrist and my neck bling
Stackin' up, countin' my blessings
Wedding bands ain't got no wedding (Woah, yeah)
I just spent a cool 60 on my wristwear (Yeah)
Man, I want 10 Plain Janes, wanna be like Ric Flair (Woo)
My blood diamonds cost me blood and sweat and tears (Woo)
Now my mind and all my stones are crystal clear (Yeah)
Fake watch busters, ain't never bustin' me (Nope)
Everyone of my jewelers get paid, they trust in me (Yeah)
Took a lean nap, had a dream 'bout a custom piece
I hit up Elliot, he said that he gon' get it done for me

[Chorus: Belly]
Bust down, Rollie, Audemars, Plain Jane
Blow dank, pour drank, everyday same thing
(Same thing, same thing, same thing
Same thing, same thing, same thing)
'Cause we just out here tryna maintain
(Same thing, same thing, same thing
Same thing, same thing, same thing)
Bust down, Rollie, Audemars, Plain Jane
Blow dank, pour drank, everyday same thing
(Same thing, same thing, same thing
Same thing, same thing, same thing)
'Cause we just out here tryna maintain
(Same thing, same thing, same thing
Same thing, same thing, same thing)
Look, yeah, yeah
