Playin' with your feelings
I've been doin' wrong
Only time I see you
Is when I'm on the drugs
I make her think I love her
But she not the one
I make her think I love her
Just so I can fuck her when I want

I make her think I love her
Just so I can fuck her when I want
I make her think I love her
Just so I can fuck her when I want

Girl I, girl I
Gotta take these trips, gotta get it on road
Say she see me gettin' money
She ain't know now she know
Girl I, Girl I
Gotta take these trips, gotta get it on road
Say she see me gettin' money
She ain't know now she know
Say she see me gettin' money
She ain't know now she know
Girl I, girl I
Gotta take these trips, gotta get it, on road

I can't open up to you
'Cause my lifestyle crazy
Now every time I'm around you
I feel so amazing
I can't open up to you
'Cause you not my baby
Now every time I'm around you
I feel so amazing
