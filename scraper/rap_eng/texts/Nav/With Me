[Chorus]
(Yo)
You should come and vibe with me (vibe with me)
Help me stack my cream  (yo, yo)
Keep you on the side with me (side with me)
Spend some time with me (yo)
These other guys are wannabes
I’m the one they wanna be (yo)
Demons, they won’t let me sleep
I wish you got high like me (yo)
You should come and vibe with me (vibe with me)
Help me stack my cream (yo, yo)
Keep you on the side with me (side with me)
Spend some time with me (yo)
These other guys are wannabes
I’m the one they wanna be (yo)
Demons, they won’t let me sleep
I wish you got high like me (yo)

[Verse 1]
You say you’re feeling down, you’re not alone (not alone)
I got something that could put you in your zone (in your zone)
Girl, I always got a hand for you to hold (all the time)
Ya, I’ma keep you warm when you feel cold (every time)
I hope you don’t believe the stories you get told
But I like the way they keep you on your toes (toes)
All the hard times made my heart turn cold (what)
Now my wrist, neck and pinky froze (froze)
Buying all this ice I think I need an extra wrist (wrist)
My belly was hurting now I order extra shrimp (shrimp, shrimp)
Don’t play with me lil’ boy I’m the wrong one to diss (diss, diss)
If we missed, it’s okay, we got extra clips

[Chorus]
(Yo)
You should come and vibe with me (vibe with me)
Help me stack my cream (yo, yo)
Keep you on the side with me (side with me)
Spend some time with me (yo)
These other guys are wannabes
I’m the one they wanna be (yo)
Demons, they won’t let me sleep
I wish you got high like me (yo)
You should come and vibe with me (vibe with me)
Help me stack my cream  (yo, yo)
Keep you on the side with me (side with me)
Spend some time with me (yo)
These other guys are wannabes
I’m the one they wanna be (yo)
Demons, they won’t let me sleep
I wish you got high like me (yo)

[Verse 2]
Pour right up I sip all of my problems away
Ain’t thinkin’ about tomorrow ‘cause I’m living for today
Since I was a kid all I wanted to do is play
I always imagine myself iced up on the stage (bling blaow)
So much frozen water needs two skates
These bitches curb me back then but now I’m straight (I’m straight)
XO like the mark capisce and you can’t relate (can’t relate)
If you bring yourself up to the table then you get a plate
I hate when you kiss me girl (girl, girl, girl)
I just want you to miss me girl (girl, girl, girl)
I wish you would get high and stay up with me girl (girl, girl, girl)
And when I’m coming down come lay up with me girl

[Chorus]
(Yo)
You should come and vibe with me (vibe with me)
Help me stack my cream  (yo, yo)
Keep you on the side with me (side with me)
Spend some time with me (yo)
These other guys are wannabes
I’m the one they wanna be (yo)
Demons, they won’t let me sleep
I wish you got high like me (yo)
You should come and vibe with me (vibe with me)
Help me stack my cream  (yo, yo)
Keep you on the side with me (side with me)
Spend some time with me (yo)
These other guys are wannabes
I’m the one they wanna be (yo)
Demons, they won’t let me sleep
I wish you got high like me (yo)
