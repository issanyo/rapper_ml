I don't wanna be the one you playin' with
You wasting time with people can't replace me with
I see manipulation I ain't sayin' shit
You can't take me out the game, oh
You can't act like I ain't shit, oh
You said you would feel it if I go
I can't ever get you on your own
I'm callin' but nobody's ever home

Chorus x2
[Game recognize game recognize game
You can't treat me like the same, like the same]

I told you I love you and I mean it, oh
Didn't have a motive just my feelings though
I can't stop from trippin' when you leavin' no
But you still think I'm being deceiving tho
I don't wanna have to think on my feet
Don't know why it seems you try to hide me
Are you playing games or do you like me?
You ain't fuckin’ slick you know that I see 

Chorus
[Game recognize game recognize game
You can't treat me like the same, like the same]
