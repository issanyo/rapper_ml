[Verse 1]
Remember sitting on the bench wearing the same clothes
They used to call me ugly, had a Blackberry with no hoes
Now she calling on my iPhone, rose gold
Bitch I'm in LA for two days, then I'm going home
I don't want to see your panties now, I just wanted dome
Driving down Santa Monica with a Asian ting
Wonder what this fame will bring
Gucci belts and diamond rings
I hope this shit don't change me
My best friends started hating me
Girlfriend moving shady, she can't trust me now
I'm standing on the ground but Xanny's got me in the clouds
Things are looking up, I still remember looking down
The labels call me up but I'ma always shut 'em down

[Chorus]
Cause I did this on my own, did this on my own yeah
I don't need no help, I rather do it by myself
Because I did this on my own, did this on my own yeah
Don't ask me something, I don't owe you nothing
Did this on my own, I did this on my own yeah
I did this on my own yeah, did this on my own
You can't tell me nothing

[Verse 2]
Heard someone say NAV is done, I'm just getting started
They said I wouldn't make it probably because of my image
Coach put me in the game
These fuckboys still playing scrimmage
Just bought the foreign with no tints
Want you to see when I'm in it
Start something for me and best believe you'll be finished
My momma called me for a hour, ain't been home in a minute
I won't drink that Sprite without Promethazine in it
I just bought some water and a Molly came wit it
Once you get a little money, lots of problems come with it
I got my city speculating, cause there's owls on my linen
They gon' ditch you when you're losing
Then come back when you're winning
That's why I can't trust nobody, knew it from the beginning

[Chorus]
That's why I did this on my own, did this on my own yeah
I don't need no help, I rather do it by myself
Because I did this on my own, did this on my own yeah
Don't ask me something, I don't owe you nothing
Did this on my own, I did this on my own yeah
I did this on my own yeah, did this on my own
You can't tell me nothing

[Outro]
Did this on my own, I did this on my own yeah
I did this on my own yeah
Did this on my own, can't tell me nothing
Can't tell me nothing
