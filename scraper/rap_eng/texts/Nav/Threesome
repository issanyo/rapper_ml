[Intro: NAV]
ATL Jacob
Jacob on the beat goin' brazy
Yuh

[Verse 1: NAV]
All my bitches shoe bottoms be red (yuh)
You can't get inside my pockets if you ain't dead
I wake up every morning and I take my meds
And every night a different bitch put me to bed (yuh)
One is good but I feel safer when I got two tings
I lost three but they ain't worth more than my new ring (yuh)
Momma told me that my first name stand for new king
I ask forgiveness, not permission when I do things
FBG, XO 'til the death of me
We got the sauce and they still tryna find the recipe
Had to kill off all my opps, I hope they rest in peace
I'm goin' ghost inside my Ghost, there ain't no catchin' me

[Chorus: NAV & Guap Tarantino]
Yeah, it's NAV and Plug, we got bags of drugs (yah)
She wanna fuck a thug, hit Magic and blow a dub
Got Brinks trucks, finna put that minks up (yah)
I just had a threesome with two bad tings, bruh

[Verse 2: Guap Tarantino]
I'm goin' Guap Mode on these niggas, ain't no stoppin' me (yah)
I got five bad tings, finna get ring, ring (yah)
I stack this money up tall, it's on Yao Ming, Ming (yah)
I'm a big bird, nigga, look at my wing, wings (yah)
Had to dip the Rollie, bust down me a Patek, ah (yah)
Look like a chain, I got the 'Rari 'round my neck, ah (yah)
I hit your main ho one time, I ain't had to text (yah)
I'm a Zone 6 nigga, I keep that TEC (yah)
Me and NAV back to back in coupe Maybachs (yah)
I told the world I'm finna have them rack rack racks (ra-ra-racks)
Cuz put me in the game, I had to wreck
Put that green batter on her, break that back
No cap

[Chorus: NAV & Guap Tarantino]
Yeah, it's NAV and Plug, we got bags of drugs
She wanna fuck a thug, hit Magic and blow a dub (yah)
Got Brinks trucks, finna put that minks up (yah)
I just had a threesome with two bad tings, bruh (yuh)
Yeah, it's NAV and Plug, we got bags of drugs (yuh)
She wanna fuck a thug, hit Magic and blow a dub (yuh)
I put the Rollie up, them diamonds wasn't enough (yuh)
I just had a threesome with two bad tings, bruh (yah, yuh)
