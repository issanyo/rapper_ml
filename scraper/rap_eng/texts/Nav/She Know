Said she see me gettin' money
She ain't know, now she know
(Girl I)
Girl I gotta take these trips, gotta get it on road
(Girl I)
Girl I gotta take these trips, gotta get it on road
Said she see me gettin' money
She ain't know, now she know
(She ain't know, now she know
She ain't know, now she know)
(I tell I'm getting money and she said that she know)
Girl, I gotta take these trips, gotta get it on road
(Said she see me gettin' money she ain't know now she know)

[Verse 1]
Said she want me to herself she don't want hang wit' my bros
Bitch I'm counting money with the squad that's all that I know
I'm screaming free all of my niggas 'til they get back on road
Mama I'm sorry that the music and the streets all I know
She say she see I'm getting money she can tell by my clothes
And she ain't seen a pack of Backwoods already filled up with dope
These niggas talk but when it's time to walk they don't want no smoke
These rappers want these beats for free, they music ain't got no hope

[Verse 2]
This industry is full of fakes, I didn't know now I know
They wishin' well to my face, I know they hate on the low
And now they see I'm gettin' money, so they callin' me bro
And all these bitches want is money so I don't need these hoes
I mix the sprite with the codeine then I pop me a Xan
Bitch, I'm going to the money, I ain't changin' my plans
And all of these bitches used to style on me and now I'm the man
And all of these bitches used to style on me and now I'm the man
