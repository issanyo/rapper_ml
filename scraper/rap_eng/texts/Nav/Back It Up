[Verse 1: NAV]
Stackin' up my cheddar (Cheddar), I'ma blow it all (All)
Nothin' lasts forever (Ever), I can't go in the mall (Uh)
Without a Beretta ('Retta), stack my money tall (Trr)
I never felt better (nope), I done seen it all (All)
Don't make me have to put you on my hit list (Hit list)
I gave my shooter a tip, ain't leave no witness (Grrr-rrrrrrah)
I mix my Rick Owens with Givenchy ('Yenchy)
Bitch, I'm from the jungle like Jumanji (Rrr)
I can't drive a Honda, want a fast car (Skrt, skrt)
Pop a stormtrooper, I'm in space like NASA (Woo, woo)
At Coachella, had a threesome with a pornstar (Smash, smash)
I want a 'Bach, I want a Bentley, might buy both cars (Skrt skrt)

[Chorus: NAV]
Told them Magic City girls to back it up (Back it up)
Threw like twenty-thousand ones like rack it up (Ra-ra-rack)
They always see me out in traffic, I can't be touched (Woo)
They don't wanna see me get my rackies up
Told them Magic City girls to back it up (Ba-ba-back)
Threw like twenty-thousand ones like rack it up (Ra-ra-rack)
They always see me out in traffic, I can't be touched
I hated bein' broke, now I got my rackies up

[Post-Chorus: NAV]
Watch me blow it fast, mmm, and stack it up (Mmm)
I love countin' cash, mmm, I feel a rush (Mmm)
Spend it, make it back, mmm, now I'm back up (Mmm)
Spend it, make it back, mmm, now I'm back up (Mmm)

[Verse 2: Guap Tarantino]
I put all the racks, mmm, in the duff'
I hit it from the back, mmm, that's enough (That's enough)
I got them rack rack racks, mmm, throw it up (Throw it up)
And now I'm in the club, mmm, with it tucked (With it tucked)
I just put a thot down on the rug (Woo)
Young Freebandz want all the smoke like a mug (Let's go)
That stayed down, went up a road on all these doves (Brrr)
Now I'm buyin' all this shit, just because (Just because)
I jumped out that Porsche, a nigga had to risk it
I'm twenty-one, now a nigga gettin' riches (Ri-ri-rich)
Them niggas wasn't really wit' me, they want it, it (No cap)
We fuckin' up Magic City, got it lit, lit (Now we lit, lit)
I like phone home, turn them racks on (Turn the racks on)
These niggas didn't know I had the Ricky racks on (Ricky racks)
Just got a show for 50k on my trap phone
She put her ass up in the air, turn them birds on (Brrr, no cap)

[Chorus: NAV]
Told them Magic City girls to back it up (Tarantino)
Threw like twenty-thousand ones like rack it up (Ah)
They always see me out in traffic, I can't be touched
They don't wanna see me get my rackies up
Told them Magic City girls to back it up (Ba-ba-back)
Threw like twenty-thousand ones like rack it up (Ra-ra-rack)
They always see me out in traffic, I can't be touched
I hated bein' broke, now I got my rackies up

[Post-Chorus: NAV]
Watch me blow it fast, mmm, and stack it up (Mmm)
I love countin' cash, mmm, I feel a rush (Mmm)
Spend it, make it back, mmm, now I'm back up (Mmm)
Spend it, make it back, mmm, now I'm back up (Mmm)
