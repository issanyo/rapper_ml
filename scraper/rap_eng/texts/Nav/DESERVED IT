[Chorus: Tracy]
Bought that bitch a bag cuz she deserved it
You dropped the receipt you can't return it (nope)
Don't give no fuck about your respect (Lil bitch)
I pray to God, they fuck my ex (yeah)
I'm on these drugs (I'm on these drugs)
I'm a God to these mothafuckin' bugs
Alex McQueen, I can't step inside the mud (fuck)
That boy sad, I got rich, he need a hug (yeah yeah)

[Verse 1: Tracy]
Had a bad bitch I got a better one (Gigi)
Tatted everywhere, I want another one
Sorry baby, I'm conceited, I don't wanna fuck
I'm the black Lil Peep with these blue bucks (yeah)
Got paid for the verse (for the verse)
Imma kill you and pay for your hearse (grraaa)
Yeah, I know you hit it first (you hit it first)
But you know what they say: "first you the worst"
Yeah, this rapper is my son , imma bad dad
I see really your swag, you can't have that (have that)
I'm on some new, new (new, new)
Pussy taste better than my food do (yum)

[Chorus: Tracy]
Bought that bitch a bag cuz she deserved it
You dropped the receipt you can't return it (nope)
Don't give no fuck about your respect (Lil bitch)
I pray to God they fuck my ex (yeah)
I'm on these drugs (I'm on these drugs)
Im a God To these mothafuckin' bugs
Alex McQueen, I can't step inside the mud (fuck)
That boy sad, I got rich he need a hug (yeah yeah)
