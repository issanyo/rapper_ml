Relay 2017
Haters said I'd never make a hit
I'm on the stage lookin' down on my peers
I'm on soundcloud tryna make a career
It's not working so Imma shift gears

[Hook]

I know what I am doing
I'm on cloud 9, floating
Gloating, going
At the end of the day I be winning

[Verse 2]

People think I need 'em
The only ones I need
Are the ones in my blood gang
They know who they are and they know I spit bars
That go far, all the way to Mars
Yeah
And I be rappin' and cappin' and mappin' my next move
Catch me on YouTube
Yeah
Ooooh
Yeaaaah
One of the first rhymers to get it poppin'
Far from it, I'm not straight outta compton
I'm from Tampa and I don't plan on stoppin'
That Ice on your wrist I am coppin'
I don't mess with the fakes
I'm not in the sun so Imma throw shade
If you try me than catch a fade, Ok
Ok
That's great
Now you don't have to go to pray
That's great
Ok, ok, ok
One thing that I know right now I'm spitting fire
And the situation's dire, dire
And these rappers are all liars
Cause the desire
The fire
The fire

[Hook]

I know what I am doin'
I'm on cloud 9 floating
Gloating, going
At the end of the day I be winning
