[Hook]
Wanna' make this money or nah'
Nigga make your mind up
In the 6 blowing smoke somewhere is where you find us
Not a killer but I could get you lined up
Wanna try me or nah make your mind up
Nigga make your mind up
Nigga make your mind up
Nigga make your mind up
(Wanna make this money or nah' make your mind up)

[Verse 1]
These niggas is bitches, hitting my digits
Talking about chickens, smoking the loud
And selling the midget, these niggas ain't serious
Wanna make money, they never go get it
Even if I don't live, yeah
I front you that work and you couldn't flip it
That's none of your business, you better go get it
You better go find it, just gon' remind it
You owe me a sack, I call it slipping
Its like perfect timing, the 4 on his back
These niggas is killers, and niggas is dealers
But only on wax, so shoutout to Trouble cause' once you a snitch
You can't take that back, no

[Hook]
Wanna' make this money or nah'
Nigga make your mind up
In the 6 blowing smoke somewhere is where you find us
Not a killer but I could get you lined up
Wanna try me or nah make your mind up
Nigga make your mind up
(Started at the top and you niggas still trying to climb up)
Nigga make your mind up

[Verse 2]
I feel like the king
Frost gave me weed I feel like I got wings
Stuffing a couple of stuff in my jeans
Bitch how do you mean
If you were down you were fucking the team
Pop me a molly and I spill the lean
Rolling up weed
J's on my feet, wings on my jeans
They hatin on me, cause they wanna be me but they can't be me
I'm making the beats, that they want for free
Can't cut me a check, you get no respect
This nigga up next
(Shout out to the Rex I'm gone)

Nigga make your mind up
Nigga make your mind up
Nigga make your mind up
