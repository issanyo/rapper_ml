[Chorus]
Before I had money, I swear that I had no life
Now I get drunk and I'm smokin' weed, poppin' pills all the time
She said that she wanna suck me off, I don't mind
You say you wanna fuck all of my niggas, you read my mind, yeah
When I wake up, only money is on my mind
When I wake up, only hunnits is on my mind
When I wake up, only money is on my mind
When I wake up, only hunnits is on my mind
Bitch, don't waste my time

[Verse 1]
She said she don't want fuck me, I told her "Don't waste my time"
I do lots of drugs but you won't see me snortin' no lines
I will not fuck that bitch if she is less than a dime
Been in the Rex for too long, almost lost my mind
Popped a couple Xannies, now I can't open my eyes
She was lookin', lookin', lookin', she jumped in the ride
Drivin' foreign cars, wait till I get her inside
I was lookin' for brain and she gave me a piece of her mind

[Chorus]
Before I had money, I swear that I had no life
Now I get drunk and I'm smokin' weed, poppin' pills all the time
She said that she wanna suck me off, I don't mind
You say you wanna fuck all of my niggas, you read my mind, yeah
When I wake up, only money is on my mind
When I wake up, only hunnits is on my mind
When I wake up, only money is on my mind
When I wake up, only hunnits is on my mind
Bitch, don't waste my time

[Verse 2]
I took some Molly, I hope it don't fuck up my night
Countin' on hundreds, yeah, they make me feel so alive
My momma can tell you that I almost fucked up my life
Fuckboys switchin' up, I tell the same story twice
I know this shit goin' left, so I had to get right
No Curry, got 30s, my shooters gon' shoot you on sight
I heard that your boyfriend is broke and he ain't got a dime
My diamonds is frozen, they shine when you turn off the lights

[Chorus]
Before I had money, I swear that I had no life
Now I get drunk and I'm smokin' weed, poppin' pills all the time
She said that she wanna suck me off, I don't mind
You say you wanna fuck all of my niggas, you wrap my mind, yeah
When I wake up, only money is on my mind
When I wake up, only hunnits is on my mind
When I wake up, only money is on my mind
When I wake up, only hunnits is on my mind
Bitch, don't waste my time
