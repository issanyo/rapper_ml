[Verse 1]
I don't care where we standin' if you feel alright
I know you'll feel better if I spend the night
You'll see me again, but in another life
(Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh)
There's still a part of me that wants to lay with you
They told me stay away, now I can't stay with you
I ain't got no time to waste to play with you
(Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh)

[Chorus]
I got what I want, I'm going to sleep
Don't kick your feet up, you gotta leave
I know you repeat it every time we speak
You're gonna leave with a part of me

[Interlude]
I still want you, girl
I still want you, girl
But I still want you, girl
I still want you, girl
But I still want you, girl
I still want you, girl
But I still want you, girl
I still want you, girl

[Verse 2]
You say I only see you when I'm in a rush
I'm the one you wanted, who you crave to love
When I'm not in town, that's when I crave your touch
(Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh)
Lying to my friends, I'm on the way to you
Thinkin' of the things I'm gonna do to you
I got nothin' to hide, nothin' to prove to you
(Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh)

[Chorus]
I got what I want, I'm going to sleep
Don't kick your feet up, you gotta leave
I know you repeat it every time we speak
You're gonna leave with a part of me

[Interlude]
I still want you, girl
I still want you, girl
But I still want you, girl
I still want you, girl
But I still want you, girl
I still want you, girl
But I still want you, girl
I still want you, girl

[Outro]
I still want you, girl
I still want you, girl
