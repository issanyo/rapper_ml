[Chorus]
Yeah, I took a couple of Ls, so you know I'm on the road now
Keep a bad-ass bitch and she always stays ten toes down
Is you really riding, girl? You know I gotta know now
And I keep a couple of hitters with me, always stay ten toes down
Ten toes down
Ten toes down
Ten toes down
Ten toes down
Is you really riding, girl? You know I gotta know now

[Verse 1]
Sometimes that's how it goes
Took a couple of Ls, so you know I am on the road
I am all alone
Call my shorty, yeah, she down to roll, uh
My bitch inspirational
Her pussy sensational
Their ain't no replacing her
Bitches ain't real enough
She peeling a Backwood up
She fill it with stinky stuff
Put the work in the truck in the spare tire
Your daddy won't know it's there, shorty
You asking why I'm paranoid, shorty
'Cause in the 6, they ain't playing fair, shorty
In the club, you won't see me there, shorty
'Cause niggas want know my when-and-where, shorty
So you know I gotta be prepared, shorty
All I really know is you down for me?

[Chorus]
Yeah, I took a couple of Ls, so you know I'm on the road now
Keep a bad-ass bitch and she always stays ten toes down
Is you really riding, girl? You know I gotta know now
And I keep a couple of hitters with me, always stay ten toes down
Ten toes down
Ten toes down
Ten toes down
Ten toes down
Is you really riding, girl? You know I gotta know now
Gotta know now
Gotta know now

[Verse 2]
You see i'm getting money now, you wanna be my bro now
You want a sip of lean and you want smoke dope now
Where your ass was at when I was calling? Car broke down
Now you wanna use my name, so you can get hoes now
Now you jumping on the bus, you want to see shows now
I heard you started rapping now, you want to spit flows now
Used to be my dog but now you acting like a hoe, now
You the type to make me change my numbers to my phones now

[Chorus]
Yeah, I took a couple of Ls, so you know I'm on the road now
Keep a bad-ass bitch and she always stays ten toes down
Is you really riding, girl? You know I gotta know now
And I keep a couple of hitters with me, always stay ten toes down
Ten toes down
Ten toes down
Ten toes down
Ten toes down
Is you really riding, girl? You know I gotta know now
