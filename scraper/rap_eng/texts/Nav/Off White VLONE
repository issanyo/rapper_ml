Off-White, Vlone 1's, foreigns parked in my lawn
Them 40's come, we jump, I like my bitches blonde
Wockhardt gimme the runs, don't none of my hoes wear Uggs
If you go on a hit you can't call off, name hold weight, can't raw dog
Off Perks and X, can't nod off, if I call you the plug, can't fall off

[Verse 1: Gunna]
Coupe from outer space (Shh), trust me, I'm okay
Bought Hi-Tech, paid by the case (By the case)
You could tell that's Chanel by the lace (Chanel)
You could tell it's a bale by the weight (By the weight)
Rock Gazelle, you could see I got cake (Got cake)
I'm a young boss, I could cut a nigga pay (Cut)
Smash, I don't never use the brakes

[Verse 2: Lil Durk]
She ask me for cash, is you serious?
New car Fast and the Furious
Spend a big bag on Amiris

Gotta suck dick on your period
You can't say, "No," I ain't hearin' it
