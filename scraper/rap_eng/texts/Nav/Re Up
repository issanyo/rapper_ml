[verse: Paradise Chubbs]
Last couple summers it was so hard
Sooo hard
Poppin pills, imma die, needa restart
I've been on these xans, imma dose off
[dose off]
Niggas called me, like I was empty and had no one
Now an days they creepin so I keep me a gun, and I never carry hundreds just a couple ones, Cus they ran up on my nigga, yea they ran a couple figures
Yea I'm trippin, yea I'm sippin
I been popping all these xans, now I'm fucking trippin
Imma go right back to tippin
Hurry up I got plans, yea you love me girl quit playing
You see you need me but you is playing
It's no fucking problem Cus I got plans
What's wrong with me Cus Iam the man
If somes wrong boy then tell em who Iam
Who the fuck is you? I don't understand
I don't understand, sorry for the wait
You know what I had too much shit on my plate
So can you please stay in place
Can't you see I'm Trynna get it
Pop million man that shit is lit
Man I just got to finish up
Pay and paint
Man you niggas can't relate
And since you niggas can't relate
Y'all Niggas can't get enough and even if...

[bridge]
Must've heard the re up

Roll a tree and fuck this Hennessy up
(Fuck it up, fuck it up)
I'm changing the hook Cus I'm starting to get ideas

[Verse #2: Jrizzy]
Uh
Lemme show you how the gangsters do it
Imma show you how to fuck it up
Imma show you how we turning up
Got my girl on the right
Chubbs in the back seat with his chick
Cruising down the city
Shit its time to speed it up
As i said cruisin down the city
Bitches asking questions
But i done reached my 60 mile limit
Quit playin' games with my mind
Should already know you're mine
Last night i was hittin from behind
You know I was tearing it up
So now let's re it up
Let's re organize and re schedule for another night
For another time
For another time
Girl you know you want it bad
Chubbs hold the liquor
Don't pass me the Hennessy
I might make some enemies tonight
Yea
Yee yee yee
Don't get wrong idea
Tell me all your secrets baby
I don't mind
Just don't waist my time
Don't go past the line
I've been working overtime
Trynna get that guap
To buy a couple ice blocks
To put on ya fingers
Now what I'm saying?
Keep ya phone on silent
Keep it on that ringer
While I make you mine
Lemme me put a ring
In your ring finger
Ya
Yee yee yee

[Outro: Chubbs]
I've been tripping and you ont believe me
You been lonely so you wanna see me
But whenever you see me
It's always envy
Cus I got money and I'm making bank
You say you wanna be done with playing
It's not dedicated it's just educated
You just really mad Cus I made it
Kill ya black thoughts, keep playing
