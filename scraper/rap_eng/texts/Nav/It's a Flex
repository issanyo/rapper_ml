[Chorus: 88 Camino]
It's a flex 'cause it drop when I talk (Hey, it's a flex)
It's a threat, your bitch toppin' me off (Nigga, is you deaf?)
Mino threat, your bitch toppin' me off
It's a jet, but the top do come off
It's a, it's a death, all this sauce when I walk
They gon' need some chalk, man, it drop when I talk
It's a, it's a death, it's assault when I walk (When I walk)
It's a, it's a death, 'cause it drop, take top off (Take top off)
It's a, it's a death, all this sauce when I walk (Ooh)

[Verse 1: 88 Camino]
Now you got me laughin' (Haha)
Damn, I'm not the nigga to be gassin'
It was clappin', I was coachin' like Phil Jackson
All my bitches scream like Michael Jackson (Ooh)
Abel, Cain, stay on top of your game (Yee)
Doppelg√§ng', you and I are not the same (Yee)
Not the same, rockin' Ricky Waffle tank
She so dumb, you go stupid, top insane (Ooh)

[Verse 2: Derek Wise]
Raggin' on her friends, then I pull up in a Benz coupe (What, yeah)
Hoppin' in the car, don't do romance, ooh (What)
All this ice on me, I know it tempts you (Pew, pew)
Blue hundreds in my pocket, what I can't do?
All I do is W, double D's, she doin' backflips (Ooh)
Tatted, look like Zoe Kravitz (Zoe Kravitz)
Turn around, she do the splits, know a youngin livin' rich (Givin' me)
Got a nigga throwin' cabbage (Yeah-ah)

[Chorus: 88 Camino]
It's a flex 'cause it drop when I talk (Hey, it's a flex)
It's a threat, your bitch toppin' me off (Me off)
Mino threat, your bitch toppin' me off
It's a jet, but the top do come off (Mino threat)
It's a, it's a death, all this sauce when I walk
They gon' need some chalk, man, it drop when I talk
It's a, it's a death, it's assault when I walk
It's a, it's a death, 'cause it drop, take top off

[Verse 3: NAV]
Navi threat, your bitch toppin' me off (Yeah)
She like the glitter on my pink Gucci socks (Oh)
I feel alive when I see enemies in shock (Oh)
I act surprised when I see enemies in chalk (Whoa)
Now they got me laughin'
Four bedroom penthouse to myself, kicked up, relaxin' (No cap)
I put my life inside my songs, I ain't just rappin'
I violate you and won't talk about what happened
Flooded out, two tone Patek (Yeah)
Drug addict (Yeah), bad habits (Yeah)
Everything authentic, automatic
I'ma need my percentage, don't make me come and get it
Never had no credit, now it's corporate card my debit
Fuck hoes, three racks a piece, I'm too cool to sweat it
I'm tryna keep the peace, still gotta keep my piece
Stick with the drum like Popeyes, hit 'em with a two-piece
Got chickens, but still serve beef

[Chorus: 88 Camino]
It's a flex 'cause it drop when I talk (Hey, it's a flex)
It's a threat, your bitch toppin' me off (Me off)
Mino threat, your bitch toppin' me off (Toppin' me off)
It's a jet, but the top do come off ('Mino threat)
It's a, it's a death, all this sauce when I walk
They gon' need some chalk, man, it drop when I talk
It's a, it's a death, it's assault when I walk (When I walk)
It's a, it's a death, 'cause it drop, take top off (Take top off)
It's a, it's a death, all this sauce when I walk (Skrrt)
