[Verse 1]
Double G buckle tucked under my shirt
I taste codeine when I burp
I bought a Bentley forgot it insured
You just a broke boy, you get on my nerves
What would I do if the music ain't work?
If I turn my trap phone off will it still chirp?
I couldn't tell nouns from a verb
But I could sell wings to a bird
I could sell tags to a shirt
Askin' me if you got tickets for sure
I don't know, I'm not sure
You just got hit with the curve
I didn't know that girl was yours
Said that she don't got no boyfriend, but sure
I grabbed her ass, and she call me a perv
Open the legs, so I had to insert
Make my own beats, and I write my own words
Cash found a diamond, tucked under the dirt
I blew my third cheque and second and first
Now I stack up, pay my bills on the first
Me and body goin' half on the chicken
First we sell it, then we splittin' the difference
I don't got no time to waste on no bitches
Cause I know that the sea got lots of fishes

[Chorus]
Smokin' and stackin' and countin' up green
I think I need me a money machine
I heard some fuckboys are plottin' on me
Waist 32, .40 tucked in my jeans
Won't forget when no one cared about me
Talkin' but they don't know shit about me
Mad I'm the person they wanted to be
This ain't the shit that they wanted to see, yeah
Now they lookin' at me
Now everybody they lookin' at me, now they lookin' at me
Now everybody they lookin' at me, now they lookin' at me
Now everybody they lookin' at me, now they lookin' at me

[Verse 2]
My money tall hunnids, blue like a Smurf
Neck full of water, it dripped on my shirt
Nobody fuckin' with XO for sure
Your label's new artist is really a nerd
Suit my bitch up, yeah I bought her a fur
Shootin' shit up, better act like you hurt
Before I tell, I'mma go to jail first
Drivin' on Xannies, I might hit the curb
Valentino on my shoes and my shirt
She ain't want me back when I wanted her
I'm from the Rex, but the Southside my turf
Had to think twice when I ordered dessert
Now I order my homies the surf with the turf
Take a full addy, with a half perc
It's the brown boy that made it happen first
Look at me zoomin' my Rari, skrt-skrt

[Chorus]
Smokin' and stackin' and countin' up green
I think I need me a money machine
I heard some fuckboys are plottin' on me
Waist 32, .40 tucked in my jeans
Won't forget when no one cared about me
Talkin' but they don't know shit about me
Mad I'm the person they wanted to be
This ain't the shit that they wanted to see, yeah
Now they lookin' at me
Now everybody they lookin' at me, now they lookin' at me
Now everybody they lookin' at me, now they lookin' at me
Now everybody they lookin' at me, now they lookin' at me
