ATL Jacob
Yuh, yuh

[Chorus: Guap Tarantino]
V12, gettin' head with no seatbelt (Skrt)
Put the sticks in the shed, yeah, we keep rounds (Yuh)
I went vert, put the green on my team now (Guap mode)
Ran it up on every nigga that was in down (Yah)
XO, FBG, my dogs, dogs (Dogs dogs)
Fuck that next ho, finna break her wall, walls (Yuh)
Don’t want my ex-ho, gotta tell her nah, nah (Nope, nope)
We havin' big racks, finna stack 'em tall, tall (Big walk)

[Verse 1: Guap Tarantino]
We flyin’ PJ every city, we some star, stars (Star stars)
We whip the foreigns, make 'em skrt like a go-kart (Skrt skrt)
This that fat nigga shit, might take your main broad (Woo)
This that rap dope, yeah, I got that rap rope, yeah (Rap rap)
Please don't get it twisted, bitch, go out the backdoor (Ah)
And I don't fuck her on the mattress, that's where racks go (ra-ra-racks)
Put the birds on the backstreet, got them birds (Brr)
I got NAV with me, bitch, he go berserk (No cap)
See, I'm a king, I can't snap a fuckin' verse (Woo)
I love the pain, got me poppin’ all of these Percs (Pop these perks)
I asked her have she seen a Rollie with baguettes (With baguettes)
I’m in Guap Mode, finna fuck her, I don't mince (Guap mode)
I keep that .40 on me, better not test (Yuh)
And, yeah, I’m on lean, I might wreck (Yuh)

[Chorus: Guap Tarantino]
V12, gettin' head with no seatbelt
Put the sticks in the shed, yeah (Tarantino), we keep rounds
I went vert, put the green on my team now (Guap mode)
Ran it up on every nigga that was in down (Yah)
XO, FBG, my dogs, dogs (Dogs dogs)
Fuck that next ho, finna break her wall, walls (Yuh)
Don't want my ex-ho, gotta tell her nah, nah (Nope, nope)
We havin' big racks, finna stack ’em tall, tall (Big walk)

[Verse 2: NAV]
I got me like seven motherfuckin' checks, dog
Smokin' cookies, got biscotti in my chest, dog
I rap my life and watch these motherfuckers' heads nod
Christmastime, I'm puttin' molly in my eggnog (Yuh)
I just flew a bad bitch out for the weekend (For the weekend)
Said she like my songs, she heard I'm signed to Weeknd (to the Weeknd)
Forgot her name and I can't find her in my recents
Avianne water, my chain in the deep end (Ring)
If you not my brother, then we cannot be friends
I expect that you gon' ride out when we beefin' (Yuh)
I bought the mall and now I'm ahead of the season
Got killers itchin' to shoot, just need a reason (Yuh)

[Chorus: Guap Tarantino & NAV]
V12, gettin' head with no seatbelt
Put the sticks in the shed, yeah (Tarantino, yuh), we keep rounds
I went vert, put the green on my team now (Guap mode)
Ran it up on every nigga that was in down (Yah)
XO, FBG, my dogs, dogs (Dogs dogs)
Fuck that next ho, finna break her wall, walls (Yuh)
Don't want my ex-ho, gotta tell her nah, nah (Nope, nope)
We havin' big racks, finna stack 'em tall, tall (Big walk)
XO, FBG, my dogs, dogs
Fuck that next ho, finna break her wall, walls
Don't want my ex-ho, had to tell her nah, nah
We havin' big racks, finna stack 'em tall, tall (Yuh)

[Outro: Guap Tarantino]
Tarantino (Yuh)
