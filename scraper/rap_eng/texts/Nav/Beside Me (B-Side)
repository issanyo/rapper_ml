[Hook]
You might not survive with me (come and get high)
She ready to die with me
Girl I need you beside me (you by my side)
She come through and set the vibe, for me
Make a promise, she won't lie to me (would you lie?)
Confide in you and you confide in me, yeah
If I need dope she gon' provide for me, yeah
I just hope that she won't lie to me

[Verse 1]
Tell the truth, how many pills did you pop yesterday?
Sent my plug a Uber, got some drank on the way
I took 2 and plus the 4 I pop yesterday
You just kissed that girl, she sucked me off yesterday
I used to sweep the floor, now people cleaning up my plates
Me and Danny Boy was smoking blunts with the maid
I didn't wanna drop my first track, I was afraid
Now doing drugs and making music getting me paid
Pour up a zip, she brought some drugs and brought her friends
Your man is a bitch, he don't pop pills, he just pretend
Drugs made me rich, I just bought my mom a Benz
Roll up a spliff, I got a bag that never ends

[Hook]
You might not survive with me (come and get high)
She ready to die with me
Girl I need you beside me (you by my side)
She come through and set the vibe, for me
Make a promise, she won't lie to me (would you lie?)
Confide in you and you confide in me, yeah
If I need dope she gon' provide for me, yeah
I just hope that she won't lie to me

[Verse 2]
She said tell the truth, you fell asleep, you said you weren't awake
I used to be down over work and under pay
Treat the addys like they Vitamin C, yeah
Got the pharmacy inside my jeans, yeah
Lots of pills inside of me, yeah
I'm exactly who I wanna be, yeah
I used to get my beats for free, yeah
Now twenty bands don't feel the same to me, yeah
Fuck her once and I won't cuddle, I won't crash around a hoe
She gon' try to snap me, I won't even nap around a hoe
Pull up on you in a Lambo and I'm lifting up my doors
You gon' realize I'm not the same NAV you used to know

[Hook]
You might not survive with me (come and get high)
She ready to die with me
Girl I need you beside me (you by my side)
She come through and set the vibe, for me
Make a promise, she won't lie to me (would you lie?)
Confide in you and you confide in me, yeah
If I need dope she gon' provide for me, yeah
I just hope that she won't lie to me
