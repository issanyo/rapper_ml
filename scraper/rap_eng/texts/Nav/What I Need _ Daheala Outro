[Intro]
My nigga Wheezy, you know what I’m sayin'?

[Chorus]
It’s 6am, and you got what I need (what I need)
I don't even wanna fuck just rub my hair 'till I fall asleep (fall asleep)
Popping pills and drinking, I’ve been doing this all week (this all week)
I went from the Novotel to a master suite (to a master suite)
Girl order what you want, but I don’t wanna eat (I don’t wanna eat)
Girl put this on your tongue if you want to feel like me (want to feel like me)
When I’m comin' down you the one I wanna see (wanna wanna see)
I don’t even wanna fuck, just rub my hair 'till I fall asleep (fall asleep)
‘Till I fall asleep (fall asleep)
You the only one I wanna see (I wanna see you)
Girl I must stay up until you free (free, free)
I got problems from the past that’s tauntin' me (tauntin' me)

[Verse 1]
When I’m coming down I feel better when I’m with you (ya)
Don’t need your money but girl I’m using you (using)
Cause when I party I ain’t including you
When the sun come up that’s when I feel like I’m losing you
I’m drifting far from who I used to be (be, be)
Now I eat like half of what I used to eat (what I used to)
Sleeping in my Gucci jacket on a double G
I don’t really get why I’m the one they wanna be
I don’t think that you up but I still call and see (call and see)
There’s a war on drugs but they keep my mind at peace (my mind at peace)
Smoke it all and buy another zip, my plug the pharmacy I refill my prescription

[Chorus]
It’s 6am, you got what I need (what I need)
I don't even wanna fuck just rub my hair 'till I fall asleep (fall asleep)
Popping pills and drinking, I’ve been doing this all week (this all week)
I went from the Novotel to a master suite (to a master suite)
Girl order what you want, but I don’t wanna eat (I don’t wanna eat)
Girl put this on your tongue if you want to feel like me (want to feel like me)
When I’m comin' down you the one I wanna see (wanna wanna see)
I dont even wanna fuck just rub my hair 'til I fall asleep (fall asleep)
‘Till I fall asleep (fall asleep)
You the only one I wanna see (I wanna see you)
Girl I must stay up until you free (free, free)
I got problems from the past that's tauntin' me (tauntin' me)

[Verse 2]
Oh, pour up, I’ve been getting tore up (throw it up, up)
I’ma pop another one if I throw up (and I go up, up)
The party only start when I show up
Got problems I can solve them with a double cup (cup, cup)
Girl I crave your energy ‘cause you’re so innocent
I’m the type to lay up with you, after I fuck another bitch
Spark it up, perkies, perk me up
Everyday I get fucked up but my money ain’t fucked up
My heart is racing I might have a meltdown (heart racing)
Girl, I can’t fall asleep I need your help now (help now)
I always feel better when you around (oh)
But especially when I’m coming down

[Chorus]
It’s 6am, you got what I need (what I need)
I don't even wanna fuck just rub my hair till I fall asleep (fall asleep)
Popping pills and drinking, I’ve been doing this all week (this all week)
I went from the Novotel to a master suite (to a master suite)
Girl order what you want, but I don’t wanna eat (I don’t wanna eat)
Girl put this on your tongue if you want to feel like me (want to feel like me)
When I’m comin' down you the one I wanna see (wanna wanna see)
I don’t even wanna fuck just rub my hair till I fall asleep (fall asleep)
‘Till I fall asleep (fall asleep)
You the only one I wanna see (I wanna see you)
Girl I must stay up until you free (free, free)
I got problems from the past that’s tauntin' me (tauntin' me)


[Interlude & Beat Switch]

[Verse 3]
Switch on my bitch (hm)
Ice on my wrist (hm)
I just wanna be lit (hm)
I just wanna be lit (hm)
V12 in my whip (hm)
Try to catch me little bitch
I just wanna be lit
I just wanna be lit, hm
I just wanna be lit, I just wanna be lit
They think I’m a lick (hm)
Thirty rounds in the clip (hm)
I just wanna be lit

[Outro]
(They’re tryna kill me and I stay on my toes)
(I woke up, I wanna go)
