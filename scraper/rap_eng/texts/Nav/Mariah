[Chorus]
Mariah
She say she ain't workin', she a liar
Mariah
She say she ain't workin', she a liar, yeah

[Verse 1]
She just flew to L.A., lookin' for a superstar
She gon' get out his whip if you got a faster car
She ain't fuckin' with you if she don't know who you are
She tryna steal some shit, I'm sleepin' off of Xanny bars
She ain't loyal, she ain't carin' but she really smart
(She really smart)
Pretendin' to have fun like you ain't workin' but I know you are
I know you are
I know you are, yeah

[Chorus]
Mariah
She say she ain't workin', she a liar, yeah
Mariah
She say she ain't workin', she a liar, yeah

[Refrain]
She gon' get out his whip if you got a faster car, yeah
If you got a faster car, yeah
Get out his whip if you got a faster car, yeah

[Verse 2]
She slipped a pill in his drink
Now she slipped off his ring
Only when you buy everything
She treat you like a king
She say she stay with her mama but she at the SLS
If you ain't spendin' no hundreds, she won't give you respect
She said she hustled all these lames but she really feelin' me
She won't fuck with L's and she love the G in me
She said fuck the music, all she want me is for me
I know that she frontin'
She want me for somethin'

[Chorus]
Mariah
She say she ain't workin', she a liar, yeah
Mariah
She say she ain't workin', she a liar, yeah

[Refrain]
She gon' get out his whip if you got a faster car, yeah
If you got a faster car, yeah
Get out his whip if you got a faster car, yeah

[Outro]
Mariah
She say she ain't workin', she a liar, yeah
Mariah
She say she ain't workin', she a liar, yeah
