[Verse 1]
Yeah I'm ballin', yeah I know
The brown boy gettin' dough
She ain't know and now she know (she know)
I used to get no hoes
But now when I come home these bitches takin' off my clothes
I'm paranoid, I never go to sleep without my pole
Be careful when you're speakin'
Feel like the devil, I got demons around me
I was hungry, now I'm eatin'
It's not my fault that you were sleeping on me
Your boyfriend rappin', he should give it up
He said he gon' make it, what's the hold up?
I'm in a 'Rari doin' donuts (skrt, skrt, skrt)
These broke boys make me sick, I'm 'bout to throw up (you a broke boy)
I play with your bitch one time and I don't repeat it
I saw that bitch, I sniped her with the neatness
I just poured a 8 inside a liter
I seen a white girl sniff three lines just like Adidas

[Chorus]
Keep on sleepin' on me, sleepin' on me
Keep on sleepin' on me
I just checked my DM, your bitch creepin' on me
I got the master plan and now they're schemin' on me
Sleepin' on me, keep on sleepin' on me
Sleepin' on me, keep on sleepin' on me
I just checked my DM, your bitch creepin' on me
I got the master plan and now they scheming on me

[Verse 2]
Creepin' on me
Your bitch popped a Xanny, now she sleepin' on me
I remember bein' broke and drivin' Hondas on E
Now I don't leave my house without that dirty on me
Got your main bitch in the foreign, now she schemin' on me
Check my DM, it's your MCM, he can't afford my beats
I just seen them linin' up to buy the shoes that's on my feet
Pop a pill, go to the future, no charge, this shit is free
Told her run the top, she sucked it off, that pussy I don't need
Do the shit I love, I swear I never planned it
She asked me where I'm from, I said another planet
Yeah I just wanna make my mama happy
My shooters psychopaths, they bustin' and they laughin'
They ask me do you want him dead, I'll make it happen
I am rollin' off the drugs, I got a habit
She was sleepin' on me, she thought I was average
Now I'ma make sure that fuck her like a savage

[Chorus]
Keep on sleepin' on me, sleepin' on me
Keep on sleepin' on me
I just checked my DM, your bitch creepin' on me
I got the master plan and now they're schemin' on me
Sleepin' on me, keep on sleepin' on me
Sleepin' on me, keep on sleepin' on me
I just checked my DM, your bitch creepin' on me
I got the master plan and now they scheming on me
