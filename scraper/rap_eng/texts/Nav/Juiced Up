[Verse 2: NAV]
I got some racks overseas
Got ice and it's drippin' on me
Double G's and double C's
Rollin' it up by the P
Fuckin' that bitch in my mink
Bend her right over the sink
I got more ice than a rink
Was ahead, don't want to see nothing pink
Fuck her mouth 'til her neck had a kink
I got the money I need
Now I need a money machine
My hundreds blue my twenties green
I feel like I'm a machine
When I'm rolling off a bean
I been rollin' for a week
I think I need me some Z's

[Pre-Chorus: Velous]
Hol up, count (count, count)
Racked up, bag up (whoo)
Hol up, count (count, count)
Racked up

[Chorus 2x: Velous]
Already I got two cups (whoo)
Battery on full and I'm juiced up (yeah, yeah)
Already and I'm too up (whoo)
Yo bitch in a room tryna choose up (yeah)

[Outro: Velous]
Hol up, count (count, count)
Racked up, bag up (whoo)
