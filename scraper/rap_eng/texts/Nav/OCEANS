King of the ocean like Nep
Making that girl so wet
Nigga get really upset
Can't shoot his shot like Steph
Cum is the smell of her breath
Call that bitch out like a ref
Swanton the pussy like Jeff
Yo pass that blunt to the left
You don't know nothing about Deez
Shoutout to that nigga named Beez
Always stay tall like the trees
Haters gon fall like the leaves
Eye in the sky like a hawk
Nigga ain't nothing but talk
Shut the fuck up and just walk
See a bad bitch and they stalk
17 but my voice deep
Talk so much put your hoe to sleep
She love rappers like Lil Peep
Told me she a lil freak
Snapchat motherfuck a streak
Never catch me walking down the street
Tell these niggas that I made this beat
Goddamn this shit neat
