[Intro: Future & Young Thug]
If Young Metro don't trust you, I'm gon' shoot you
Metro Boomin want some more, nigga

[Pre-Chorus]
Me and Metro don't need help
Mail a pint to myself
Flew a pornstar to ATL
Louis Goyard belt
5 star hotels
Buy everything on the rack (cash)
Buy everything on the shelf (cash)
I make you mad, I can tell

[Chorus]
Perfect timing, yeah
Watch full of diamonds, yeah (bling)
Chart climbing, yeah
Foreign car driving, yeah (skrt)
Perfect timing, yeah
Diamonds shining, yeah
Stars aligning, yeah
It's perfect timing, yeah

[Verse 1]
Double styrofoam cup (lean)
Big dog, you a pup
Since me and Metro made "Up"
All these bitches acting like sluts
You're not the type I can trust
Feel your energy through your touch
Follow feelings in my gut
Choppa turn your body into dust
She don't wanna listen to you
Your girlfriend listening to me
She on the phone with you
While she sucking on me
Off-white and Supreme
VLONE Vs, double Gs
Molly, liquor, bush, weed
These bitches so easy to please

[Pre-Chorus]
Me and Metro don't need help
Mail a pint to myself
Flew a pornstar to ATL
Louis Goyard belt
5 star hotels
Buy everything on the rack (cash)
Buy everything on the shelf (cash)
I make you mad, I can tell

[Chorus]
Perfect timing, yeah
Watch full of diamonds, yeah (bling)
Chart climbing, yeah
Foreign car driving, yeah (skrt)
Perfect timing, yeah
Diamonds shining, yeah
Stars aligning, yeah
It's perfect timing, yeah

[Verse 2]
Bust down rollie, flood it with diamonds
Can't tell what the time is, still know it's perfect timing
See it, want it, then I buy it, yeah
Lambo roar like a lion, yeah
Private jets is what I'm flying, yeah
Watching rap careers dying, yeah
Won't come to your wedding 'cause I don't want to wear a suit
Walking through the snow, I'm wearing YSL boots
9AM I'm off the Addys, still up in the booth
These other brown boys corny
They love me 'cause I'm the truth

[Pre-Chorus]
Me and Metro don't need help
Mail a pint to myself
Flew a pornstar to ATL
Louis Goyard belt
5 star hotels
Buy everything on the rack (cash)
Buy everything on the shelf (cash)
I make you mad, I can tell

[Chorus]
Perfect timing, yeah
Watch full of diamonds, yeah (bling)
Chart climbing, yeah
Foreign car driving, yeah (skrt)
Perfect timing, yeah
Diamonds shining, yeah
Stars aligning, yeah
It's perfect timing, yeah
