[Intro: NAV & Shad da God]
Ya
Run that back, Turbo

[Chorus: NAV & Gunna]
Ya
I told Gunna it’s your time to eat (eat)
These rappers cornballs they tellin’ lies on beats
Fuck a suit and tie, I got drip on me (me)
Bitch, we got mob ties better not flip on me (ya)
Bitch, we got frog eyes on that Bentley B (B)
I’m rocking minks and chinchillas to my knees
My brother NAV told me, “It’s our time to eat” (eat)
We got mob ties and you better not switch on me (ya)

[Verse 1: Gunna & NAV]
I cut my line, I can’t talk to you for free (no)
I got ten shows and they go for twenty a piece (show, show)
I had two hoes last night, sucking me to sleep (ya)
I pay Hunchos for that presidential suite (ya)
I pay for everything, these bitches can’t call me cheap (no)
Buy my bitch a Rolex now I don’t hear her speak (no)
I know everything keep my ear to the streets (oh)
And every time I pop a seal, I'm payin' a fee
I called my dentist told him put diamonds inside my teeth
My life high maintenance so my froyo come with speed (woah)
I cop the Plain jane AP, cost 40 Gs (plain janeAP)
My drip insane, it’s hard for me to get beached (French toast)

[Chorus: NAV & Gunna]
I told Gunna it’s your time to eat (eat)
These rappers cornballs they telling’ lies on beats (ya, beats)
Fuck a suit and tie, I got drip on me (on)
Bitch, we got mob ties better not flip on me (ya)
Bitch, we got frog eyes on that Bentley B (B)
I’m rocking minks and chinchillas to my knees (ya)
My brother NAV told me, “it’s our time to eat” (eat)
We got mob ties and you better not switch on me (ya)

[Verse 2: Gunna & NAV]
I’m in that 'bach behind a curtain getting top (yeah)
I can never buy a Birkin for a thot (no)
Had a coupe, hard, top turned to a drop
I walked in and bought all the Gucci socks
I got fancy VS yellow diamond rocks
Made myself a boss, ain't punching on the clock
Mixed the Gucci with the RAF, my white is off
Me and Gunna the same, we cut from a different cloth
Shopping in London, I like European cloth (European cloth)
Stacked up my money and I made myself a boss (made myself a boss)
Opening Ceremony Leatherman Trench, when I walk (stop)
Move to the penthouse and let my ex keep the loft
I’m dripping in VLONE I got XO on my socks
Got some young boy sippin’ on Fanta, ready to pop
I’m the real deal, I’m talking the talk and walking the walk (yeah)
If I can’t get no red, I’ll probably be sippin’ on Wock
Told her give me head, ain’t wanna hear her talk (ya)
Now I gotta key one in her head inside my Glock (Glock, ya)
YSL, XO, Gunna drippin' like a mop (light a mop)
Had fell in love with syrup, I'm sippin' red and Wock (ya)

[Chorus: NAV & Gunna]
I told Gunna it’s your time to eat (eat)
These rappers cornballs they tellin’ lies on beats (ya, beats)
Fucking suit and tie, I got drip on me (me)
Bitch, we got mob ties better not flip on me (ya)
Bitch, we got frog eyes on that Bentley B (B)
I’m rocking minks and chinchillas to my knees
My brother NAV told me, “It’s our time to eat” (eat)
We got mob ties and you better not switch on me (me)
Yo
