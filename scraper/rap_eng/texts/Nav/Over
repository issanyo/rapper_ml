[Bridge]
Ain't shit that you could tell me
Say your daddy got money, she gon' pay for the Telly
Started to catch feelings now
Cause I only check for you when a nigga feeling empty
Say she wanna ride for a nigga
She'll die for a nigga
Yeah I know she will, I know she will
Gotta keep it on the low shawty
Yeah you know the deal, you know the deal

[Hook]
If my girl find out then it's over
If my girl find out then it's over
If my girl find out then it's over
If my girl find out then it's over
If my girl find out then it's over
If my girl find out then it's over
If my girl find out then it's over
If my girl find out then it's over

[Verse 1]
I told Trouble Trouble he gotta cover for me
Cause my girl moving like an undercover on me
If her friend say she see me with an ex girl
Then her friend probably see me with an ex girl
She ring my phone down, tell me where you at
I'm a Scorpio, I'm killing bitches like a Zodiac
These other bitches say they love me
I'ont love em back, I only love you shawty
Like tell me what you wanna do shawty
And if we split up then we both gon' lose shawty
I need you and I just want these hoes for they body
These bitches come and go but you always stay down shawty
She like a pistol yeah I need her by my side
Clip fully loaded and she always down to ride
She gon' pay the bail if I ever catch a case
That's why I had to put my side chick in her place

[Bridge]
Ain't shit that you could tell me
Say your daddy got money, she gon' pay for the Telly
No starting to catch feelings now
Cause I only check for you when a nigga feeling empty
Say she wanna ride for a nigga
She'll die for a nigga
Yeah I know she will, I know she will
Gotta keep it on the low shawty
Yeah you know the deal, you know the deal

[Hook]
If my girl find out then it's over
If my girl find out then it's over
If my girl find out then it's over
If my girl find out then it's over
If my girl find out then it's over
If my girl find out then it's over
If my girl find out then it's over
If my girl find out then it's over
