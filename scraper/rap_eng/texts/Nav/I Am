[Intro: Future]
If young Metro don't trust you I'm gon' shoot you

[Chorus]
15 racks, 20 racks, 30 racks, I got them bands
Hearts with the eyes on my shirt and them D&G pants
Ice on my neck and no I didn't get no advance
Bitch you know I'm tryna fuck and I don't wanna dance
Now I can't go to the mall 'cause they know who I am
I don't wanna I donâ€™t wanna talk to that bitch 'cause she know who I am
I know she really don't love me, she love who I am
When I go back to the Rex, yeah, they know where I am

[Verse 1]
I just got ashes all over my Balmains I don't give a damn
Come to your party and take all your bitches and ruin your plans
I'm on the stage getting paid and your bitch in the stands
I get free Js every week and I don't wear no Vans
I'm getting plays and you're not, let's do the math
You think she's a good girl and she's getting fucked
You don't know the half
Abel just gave me an addy and I took a half
Couldn't find double cups, poured up a deuce in a glass
Get out of line and my shooter put you on your ass
Since I got money she don't give a fuck if I don't got no abs
I know I'm really the best but I don't like to brag
I'll get you clapped, guaranteed if I put up a bag

[Chorus]
15 racks, 20 racks, 30 racks, I got them bands
Hearts with the eyes on my shirt and them D&G pants
Ice on my neck and no I didn't get no advance
Bitch you know I'm tryna fuck and I don't wanna dance
Now I can't go to the mall 'cause they know who I am
I don't wanna talk to that bitch 'cause she know who I am
I know she really don't love me, she love who I am
When I go back to the Rex, yeah, they know where I am

[Verse 2]
I had to go and get right 'cause I'm done doing wrong
His bitch just called me, she said I been gone for too long
See me in public you don't know what drugs that I'm on
I could be standing right here but I'm already gone
They didn't wanna pay me for beats now they can't tell me shit
I sell two beats, call my jeweler and flood out my wrist
Bucksy just poured up a four and I'm taking a sip
I might see purple codeine when I'm taking a piss
If I send Frost to finesse you you won't get it back
I really did it, I'm puttin' brown boys on the map
Used to go nuts for these girls now they all on my sack
I just want her for a night you can take her right back

[Chorus]
15 racks, 20 racks, 30 racks, I got them bands
Hearts with the eyes on my shirt and them D&G pants
Ice on my neck and no I didn't get no advance
Bitch you know I'm tryna fuck and I don't wanna dance
Now I can't go to the mall 'cause they know who I am
I don't wanna fuck with that bitch 'cause she know who I am
I know she really don't love me, she love who I am
When I go back to the Rex, yeah, they know where I am

[Outro: Future]
If young Metro don't trust you I'm gon' shoot you
