[Verse 1]
Lately I don’t wanna sleep (I don’t wanna go to sleep)
‘Cause my life feel better than my dreams (my life is better than my dreams)
I’m in Hollywood, I’m on the scene (I’m on the scene)
But everything ain’t what it seems
Everybody gonna treat you different when you on (on, on)
I just hope when they talk they remember my name when I’m gone (gone, gone)
Cut my grass low, see the snakes (eh)
Don't know how you could lie to my face
They want a piece, see stacking my cake (woah)
I’ma disappear, won’t leave a trace (woah)

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Girl, I’m calling your phone, ‘cause I’m poppin’ them pills again (popping them pills again)
Girl, I’m lying to you when I say I’ll never lie again (you know I’ma lie again)
I’m gettin’ old, I’m scared I don’t want the rockstar life to end
And I’m livin’ the shit that I write ‘cause it’s hard to pretend

[Chorus]
My life will never be the same (ya, I won’t be the same)
But I’m scared I’m never gonna change (ya, I’m never change)
I’m addicted to the money and fame (ya)
I’m tryna control these thoughts in my brain (ya)
I’m scared I’m never gonna change, ya (ya)
I’m scared I’m never gonna change (ya)
I’m addicted to the money and fame (you feel, ah)
I’m tryna control these thoughts in my brain (ya)

[Verse 2]
When they ask me if I’m good, I say “ya” but I’m not (not)
My bro is still homeless and he’s still cookin’ on the pot (pot)
He said, “I gotta get this money on the road,” I hope he don’t get caught (caught)
Yeah I’ma keep it real, I’ma stay with my day-ones from the block (block)
To all of my enemies, it’s R.I.P
Now I don’t need to show I.D. ‘cause I’m VIP
Push start, don’t start my car with a key
Went from 8 balls, to a half, to a key
I hated selling my beats
Now I keep ‘em all for me

[Pre-Chorus 2]
I’ve been going down the wrong path and I’m ignoring the signs (the signs)
I’m having trouble organizing the thoughts in my mind (mind)
Now time is money so you know I’m not wasting my time (time)
If they pull me over, I don’t know what they gon’ find

[Chorus]
My life will never be the same (ya, I won’t be the same)
But I’m scared I’m never gonna change (ya, never change)
I’m addicted to the money and fame (you feel, ah)
I’m tryna control these thoughts in my brain (ya)
I’m scared I’m never gonna change, ya (ya)
I’m scared I’m never gonna change (ya)
I’m addicted to the money and fame (you feel, ah)
I’m tryna control these thoughts in my brain (ya)

[Outro]
(Ya, ya, ya)
