[Chorus]
Did this by myself, they say I sold my soul
(But they can't tell me nothing)
Will the fast life ever end for me? Nobody knows
(I told them imma keep on stuntin’)
I wonder who would stick beside me if I lost it all
If I was spendin' reckless, would you let me blow it all?
You was there when it was time to ball
If I'm ever losin’, hope you don't ignore my calls

[Verse 1]
In L.A. I'm hidin' from my problems and the snow
I start feelin' empty when my cup is low
Watch your drink around me, I spent three rack on my coat
Fell in love with money, first dime bag that I sold
Fuckin' hoes and shopping gettin' old
In Houston fucked a stripper, came straight off the pole
You should know the game is sold, I never told
My favorite rappers washed up in the gettin' old
I just seen your favorite rapper in the store
I just bought in cash, she put that shit on hold
I got a lot but yeah, I still want more
Count this money ’til my thumbs get sore

[Chorus]
Did this by myself, they say I sold my soul
(But they can’t tell me nothing)
Will the fast life ever end for me? Nobody knows
(I told them imma keep on stuntin')
I wonder who would stick beside me if I lost it all
If I was spendin’ reckless, would you let me blow it all?
You was there when it was time to ball
If I'm ever losin', hope you don't ignore my calls

[Verse 2]
My bro just told that the streets is all he know
Sendin’ money every month to give him hope
Fucked up his re-up, had to scrape it out the bowl
I heard he robbed the plug and now he sellin' dope
My teachers used to call me dumb and send me home
Karma is a bitch, and you reap what you sew
I just seen to rollies and I both 'em both
God gave me two pinkies, I put rings on both
They wanna see me lose, that's nothing new
All this ice help me keep my cool
Couldn't handle the pressure if you were in my shoes
I made it, I still work like I got something to prove

[Chorus]
Did this by myself, they say I sold my soul
(But they can't tell me nothing)
Will the fast life ever end for me? Nobody knows
(I told them imma keep on stuntin')
I wonder who would stick beside me if I lost it all
If I was spendin' reckless, would you let me blow it all?
You was there when it was time to ball
If I'm ever losin', hope you don't ignore my calls
