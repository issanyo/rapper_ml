[Verse 1]
Police pat me down them bands all on me
Molly, purple drank is all that I need
Come get your bitch cause she dancing on me
I remember these bitches were laughing at me
Now she sucking, fucking, clapping for me
Hit me, DM, told she was a fan
I was nobody when I made "The Man"
Now when these bitches see me, know who I am
His bitch looking I think she a flirt
Owls inside my shoes and XO my shirt
Diss me once and you'll be dead on the first
I'm staying clean but my squad doing dirt
I'm staying clean, let my squad do the dirt
Hating on me cause they can't get a verse
Summertime, shitting on you in a 'vert
My diamonds are water I'm smoking on Earth
'Member my mama told me I'm the worst
When the check come in she seeing it first
Buy her a house, I'mma buy her a purse
Looking for handouts, don't get on my nerves
You telling lies, I'm a man of my word
And your wifey just hit me but she getting curved
I'm wearing brand names that you never heard
How to get money, you never gon' learn

[Bridge]
I found myself a plug when I was down in Cali
Cause I met some white girls sniffing coke up in the Valley
I'm sorry, I'm just really high, hi nice to meet you
I told her I just wanna fuck girl I don't need it

[Hook]
I fell in love with LA, yeah
I fell in love with LA, yeah
I fell in love with LA, yeah
I might not go home I might just stay

[Verse 2]
Yeah I love LA
Met a baddie from the Bay
Suck and fuck all day
But she can't call me bae
Smoking weed all day
In Beverly I stay
The weather got me feeling so good
That I put the Xans away
Started from the bottom
I just dropped the top
She want the molly, yeah I got 'em
His bitch gave me top
My shooter got a mop
Deading all your talks
I love getting stoned
My watch is full of rocks
She say "Nav, why you so hood?"
She don't know about the Rex
Had to tell my squad to clean it up
I don't wanna make a mess
Body coming home, he gon' beat the case
So you know he know what's next
Fucking up a check
Diamonds dancing on my neck

[Bridge]
I found myself a plug when I was down in Cali
Cause I met some white girls sniffing coke up in the Valley
I'm sorry, I'm just really high, hi nice to meet you
I told her I just wanna fuck girl I don't need it

[Hook]
I fell in love with LA, yeah
I fell in love with LA, yeah
I fell in love with LA, yeah
I might not go home I might just stay
