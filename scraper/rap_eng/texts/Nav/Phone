[Verse 2: NAV]
She said "you can text me back, why you wanna call for?"
She do what she can, while I'm doing what I want
Hit that bitch one time an' then I kick her out the door
I just bought a pint, I hit up Purpp, I need some smoke
I'm a rockstar with no band, but I got bands
Call her when I land, she change her plans
Always had a plan, yeah, to be the man, yeah
Came up sellin' grams, now bitches hit me on the 'Gram, yeah
Louis V., Supreme
Your man ain't got no swag, he hashtag "true religion fiend"
Got a check and run it up (run it up)
All my chains on but I'm keepin' somethin' tucked (pew)
Sawed my shotty off, now that's my little pump

She just hit my phone (hello, brrr)
Fucked that bitch (who?), kicked her out the door (hello?)
She just hit my phone (hello, what, brrr), my phone (ouu)
She just hit my phone (my phone), smashed that bitch, go out that door (go out the door, Purpp)
Go out the door, yeah (door)
She just hit my phone, go out the door, yeah (hello?)
Fucked that bitch, she out the door, yeah (brrr, ohhh)
Fucked that bitch, I kicked her out the door, yeah
