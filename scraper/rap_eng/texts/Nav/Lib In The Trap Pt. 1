[Hook: Nav]


[Verse 1: King Libra]
I’m one of the
Real niggas left in my city
Damn I’m the up next
I say it cause I’m gritty
Hol up
Just to let y'all know
King los ain't the only king that's in the 410
They can not fuck with the flow
My flow like whoa
Libra la flame
Come equipped with the game
Nigga I’m king stay in yo lane
Pick a spot in my city
And I come with the baddest
17 calling plays like a nigga madden
Black walt disney you would think a nigga magic
She don't want me oh so tragic
And I’m that nigga that make niggas panic
And she call me papi but I’m not hispanic
Ocean so deep come ride my titanic
