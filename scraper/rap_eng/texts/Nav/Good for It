[Verse 1]
Spark a Woody, gettin' buzz like Lightyear
You fuck that bitch, I fucked her first so I might care
Got these rappers stressin' out, they growin' white hair
I dumped that bitch, sold her a dream, I gave her nightmares
They talkin' shit from far away, my .40 right here
Shooter shoot like Steve Kerr, I feel like Mike here
Told that bitch I'm not Mike Tyson, I don't bite ears
My shorty 21, she in her prime years
I don't want her body, I want her mind, yeah
My Lambo will transform, Optimus Prime, yeah
I had to leave the Rex, the 6 is full of slimes, yeah
They see me gettin' money, feel like droppin' dimes, yeah
She said she wanna be my wife, I said don't waste my time
I'll prolly keep on fuckin' bitches 'til I'm 49
Please don't try me 'cause you know I'm Addy'd up
He thought he was lit until we lit him up

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm just a brown boy with a bag
I got hitters poppin' shit, I'm just poppin' all these tags
Come get your issue, we got mags
The only time when I'm not fuckin' on your bitch, she on the rag

[Chorus]
Told my plug I need a pound
You know I'm good for it
I book a flight for your bitch
She know I'm good for it
My jeweler made another chain
He know I'm good for it
I'm what the music game needed
Yeah I'm good for it

[Verse 2]
Got some money and they sayin' that I changed now
She don't wanna fuck me, I'm tryna fuck her friend now
She said she not a stripper, I still made her strip now
I'm doin' good, I left the Rex, I'm off the strip now
Had to upgrade all my shooters, got 'em 30 clips
Told 'em best not wear my merch when you be doin' shit
My bro still in the trap, I'm tryna get him out the shit
'Cause he can't build a house with only half a brick
Ain't talkin' burgers when I say that we was hittin' licks
You fuck around I might just fuck around and fuck your bitch
You switch your life around and that's when all your family switch
Tell me who else would keep the lights on if I wasn't lit
These pussies actin' like some toilets, wanna take my shit
I got Somali's from the south side, they be sprayin' shit
Like 2K player mode, I had to recreate myself
You wearin' fake designer, try to recreate my belt

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm just a brown boy with a bag
I got hitters poppin' shit, I'm just poppin' all these tags
Come get your issue, we got mags
The only time when I'm not fuckin' on your bitch, she on the rag

[Chorus]
Told my plug I need a pound
You know I'm good for it
I book a flight for your bitch
She know I'm good for it
My jeweler made another chain
He know I'm good for it
I'm what the music game needed
Yeah I'm good for it
