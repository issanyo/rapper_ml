[Verse 1]
They hatin' on me cause I did on my own
Yeah, I did it by myself
Got me stressing, I just put a half an addy on my tongue and let it melt
Sometimes I can't handle all the pressure
Pop a couple bars, I wanna go to sleep forever
Pour me up a four in any place in any weather
My squad is full of rockstars and they roll with heavy metal
I just shed a tear, hit the diamond on my bezzel
The ones who share a blood with me, the fakest people ever
I'm just trying to make it and they're wishing I would settle
You get a little money, thinkin' you worshipping the devil
I can take you to the water
You ain't drinking? I can't help you
Just cause I say I trust you that don't mean I don't doubt you
You wanna change your life you gotta change the people around you
I just fucked your bitch, she said "I'm so glad that I found you"

[Pre-Hook]
I made her pop a pill then I made her pop another one
Passed out on your bitch and when I woke up she had nothing on (she had nothing on)
I could drop ten hits and they gon' say they want another one
Shitting on my name because i made it, they ain't nothing on

[Hook]
They got nothing on me
They got nothing on, they got nothing on
They got nothing on me
They got nothing on, they got nothing on
They got nothing on me
They got nothing on, they got nothing on
They got nothing on me
They got nothing on, they got nothing on
They got nothing on me

[Verse 2]
They see the money coming my way
Now these bitches all in my face
You got nothing on me, shouldn't have stunted on me
Now they wanna see me cause I'm getting paid
Always feel better when in L.A
Cause they wanna do something where I stay
I gotta live forever cause I can't be replaced
My shoota 15, 16 on his waist
Say the wrong thing and I might get you blowed up
All these bitches wanna see a brown boy glow up
Remember me and Frost on the road eating cold cuts
Now when I'm feeling down all I ever do is pour up
I was in the Honda bumping Kiss Land
Met Abel and he told me I'm a sick man
I'm gonna spend like 20K on a wristband
If I see your girl, yeah, she might go missing

[Pre-Hook]
I made her pop a pill then I made her pop another
Passed out on your bitch and when I woke up she had nothing on
I could drop ten hits and they gon' say they want another one
Shitting on my name because on me they have nothing on

[Hook]
They got nothing on me
They got nothing on, they got nothing on
They got nothing on me
They got nothing on, they got nothing on
They got nothing on me
They got nothing on, they got nothing on
They got nothing on me
They got nothing on, they got nothing on
They got nothing on me
