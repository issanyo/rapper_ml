[Verse 1: Alexis]

I learned the game from no one, I did it on my own
Back to back nights writing lyrics on the phone
Back to back fights with bitches who wouldn’t leave me alone
I was too far in the game to pump the brakes, wasn’t about to be blamed for your mistakes
I got bitches calling me out everyday, wanna say I’m a wannabe, and that I’m a fake
But in reality, I’m the realist
My boys know it, that’s what my phone never stops ringing
Fuck the drinks, I don’t need to be leaning
I did all this sober never leaving home, girl
I don’t need you going around trying to diss me, girl
I don’t need you trying to brag to me, girl
Tell your boy to hit me up whenever he leaves, girl
Yeah I ain’t got no chill, I never did, and I never will
This is for you all who are doubting me, have fun when you see me on the TV
I’m back to back in this bitch, I don’t ever stop
Not even when the critics try to push me off the top
Not even when the rappers are all dissing me
Bitch who’s the one that’s got all the money?  It ain’t even funny
Say you hate me but I know you really love me, say you doubt me but I know you really trust me
Trying to fight against the movement when I know you really want something to do with it
Can’t help I’m killing it, you know I’ll always be the shit

[Verse 2: Tripper Getem]

Back to back I’m in this shit for the second time
Had to the way that Alexis is recking rhymes
Never stop unless you die
Running like the naked mob
Pay attention, class in session
Yeah this is that lesson five
You already knowing how it go down
Disturbing the peace because it’s so loud
You already knowing we gon’ show out
Tear the roof down, fuck the whole house
It’s the new years, we got the new bangers
Spitting that flame, don’t give a fuck who hate us
What you say don’t make us, you just some fucking haters
And you do not pay us, instead of talking on a daily basis
Back to back, we back at it but never quit
On the track, we rap crack so never trip
Back to back, we back at it but never quit
Hit em with the three peat, yeah that’s off the rip
