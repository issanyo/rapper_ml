[Intro: NAV & Future]
She shake that ass and bring the cash to me
She shake that ass and bring the cash to me
If young Metro don't trust you, I'm gon' shoot you

[Pre-Chorus]
It's midnight
Took a half baby
It's halftime
What's your math baby?
You look alright
Your heart is cold but it's warm inside your thighs
Sell your soul to me and give me your mind

[Chorus]
She shake that ass and bring it back to me
She shake that ass and bring it back to me
Her boyfriend mad and now he after me
Finessed his ass she brought the cash to me

[Verse 1]
She shake it on the pole
She got work done on her nose
Now there's work all on her nose
The only thing she touch is money or her toes
She got a pink Glock beside the condoms in her purse
You think boys are bad but mostly girls be doing the dirt
She got a sugar daddy paying bills it's not her first
When everybody go to sleep that's when she go to work

[Pre-Chorus]
It's midnight
Took a half baby
It's halftime
What's your math baby?
You look alright
Your heart is cold but it's warm inside your thighs
Sell your soul to me and give me your mind

[Chorus]
She shake that ass and bring it back to me
She shake that ass and bring it back to me
Her boyfriend mad and now he after me
Finessed his ass she brought the cash to me

[Verse 2]
That money make her happy
Designer make her happy
She don't know her daddy
So she call me daddy
She drive an AMG
She don't want no Caddy
She ready for the drama
Don't talk to her mama
Hide out in the wintertime
Stack up in the summer
Ones fill her trunk up
She roll all my blunts up
Looking at me 'cross the club
I just gave her the thumbs up

[Pre-Chorus]
It's midnight
Took a half baby
It's halftime
What's your math baby?
You look alright
Your heart is cold but it's warm inside your thighs
Sell your soul to me and give me your mind

[Chorus]
She shake that ass and bring it back to me
She shake that ass and bring it back to me
Her boyfriend mad and now he after me
Finessed his ass she brought the cash to me

[Outro]

Bring that cash to me lil baby
I'll help you with all your problems bae
Bring that cash to me lil baby
I'll help you with all your problems bae
