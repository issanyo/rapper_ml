[Intro]
I help you with all of your problems but
You’re becoming one for me too (for me too)
Tired of hearin’ about the bills you gotta pay
‘Cause I got them too (I got them too, yeah I got them too)

[Pre-Chorus]
I got real things to think about
I’m not worried about you (I’m not worried about you, worried about you)
Fives, tens, twenties and a fifties, all my hundreds blue (blue)

[Chorus]
I can’t hold your hands through this shit (ah)
Can’t hold your hands through this shit
It’s not my fault I got rich, and you still ain’t got shit (still ain’t got shit)
Can’t hold your hands through this shit (ah)
Can’t hold your hands through this shit
I went through pain for all of this (for all of this)
I had to change for all of this (for all of this)

[Post-Chorus]
Why you got your hands out? (ah, hands out)
I always have everything planned out (planned out)
It’s funny how everything panned out (panned out)
The tables turned now I'm the man now (man now)

[Verse 1]
How you smoking everyday when you need me to pay your phone (phone)
Where you spend the money I gave to you?
You said you don’t know (what?)
I had nobody to help me when I felt alone (alone)
Had no time to make excuses I just did it on my own
When I count my money, I can feel you looking sideways at me (sideways at me)
You always staring at my chain and now you mad
‘Cause everybody’s looking at me (body looking at me ya)
You can’t make what I make in a month in a year
Just saw my niece and I put diamonds in her ears (ears)
The way you talking to me got me feeling weird
I see everything, don’t think I’m not aware (ware)
When I needed you, you weren’t there (there)
Now you want to go with me everywhere (where)
You say I ain’t keeping it real and that ain’t fair (fair)

[Pre-Chorus]
I help you with all of your problems but (but)
You’re becoming one for me too (for me too)
Tired of hearin’ about the bills you gotta pay (pay)
‘Cause I got them too (I got them too, yeah I got them too)
I got real things to think about
I’m not worried about you (noo, I’m not worried about you)
Fives, tens, twenties and a fifties, all my hundreds blue (blue)

[Chorus]
I can’t hold your hands through this shit (ah)
Can’t hold your hands through this shit
It’s not my fault I got rich, and you still ain’t got shit (still ain’t got shit)
Can’t hold your hands through this shit (ah)
Can’t hold your hands through this shit
I went through pain for all of this (for all of this)
I had to change for all of this (for all of this)

[Post-Chorus]
Why you got your hands out? (ah, hands out)
I always have everything planned out (planned out)
It’s funny how everything panned out (panned out)
The tables turned now I am the man now (man now)

[Outro]
You were never ten toes down, so I don’t care
They know who I am, I’m good for it, the money's there (there)
Now you call me yeah you feel some way (way, way)
Did you see NAV he was spendin' bands today? (today, today)
Last time I checked out I heard you played on both sides (sides)
Cut you off now only money on my mind (mind)
The last time you held me down it’s been a minute (minute)
I put in work like A$AP Ferg you know I’m winnin’ (winnin’)
Feeling lonely off the drugs, I called Mariah
Told her bring it back, I need some more of ya
Everything hit, look at my bust-down, make me feel rich
Look at my fit, you know I’m NAV, I didn’t pay for it
