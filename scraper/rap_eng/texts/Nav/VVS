[Chorus: Guap Tarantino]
These VVSs on my neck, them diamonds shinin’ (Oh)
Cuz just bought the new Maybach, the top reclinin' (Skrt)
I told these niggas don't hit my jacket, I'm flyin' private (Flyin private)
I drip that sauce up on that green, I'm thousand island
We on that young nigga shit, you know we stylin'
Put some Chanels on that ting, it made her goddess
I came a long way from them bank deposits
All that shit that we done went through, now we got it

[Verse 1: Guap Tarantino]
Sixteen, fuckin' hoes in the lobby (Racks)
Bad tings, I’m on they neck like a violin (Woo)
More wings than a jet, I got them risin’ (Brr)
We just kickin', havin’ sex on an island
I just seen she badder when I put her in that Mazi (Yah)
And I told all the betters I'ma work it, nonstop it
Hell nah, I won't let up, got them birds from the posse (Yah)
Yeen got no money, then just shut up, you erased from the topic (Yah yah)
I hit your bitch, man, havin' sex like where my hide is?
I keep that Drizzy, fuck them niggas pocket watchin’ (Brr)
I'm havin' so much spill that it's toxic
And I stay on that pill, gimme that body (Woo)

[Chorus: Guap Tarantino]
These VVSs on my neck, them diamonds shinin' (Oh)
Cuz just bought the new Maybach, the top reclinin' (Skrt)
I told these niggas don't hit my jacket, I'm flyin' private (Flyin private)
I drip that sauce up on that green, I'm thousand island
We on that young nigga shit, you know we stylin'
Put some Chanels on that ting, it made her goddess
I came a long way from them bank deposits
All that shit that we done went through, now we got it

[Verse 2: NAV]
First time I sold some work, I got it on consignment
First grade, I went to school ain't hand in my assignments (Yuh)
Might take a vacay, twenty bitches on a island
If I see it and I want it, then I'm buyin' (Yuh)
It's harder bein' fake so what's the point in lyin'?
I been through so much pain like, what's the point in cryin'? (Yuh)
Ain't pullin' over, never sober when I'm drivin'
On tour, I get drugs every city I arrive in (Yuh)
Makin' songs, I came a long way sellin' remix
I got so much rings that I could cover three fists
Pay for everything, but I can't stand a cheap bitch
Bust down AP, this is not a cheap wrist

[Chorus: Guap Tarantino]
These VVSs on my neck, them diamonds shinin' (Oh)
Cuz just bought the new Maybach, the top reclinin' (Skrt)
I told these niggas don't hit my jacket, I'm flyin' private (Flyin private)
I drip that sauce up on that green, I'm thousand island
We on that young nigga shit, you know we stylin'
Put some Chanels on that ting, it made her goddess
I came a long way from them bank deposits
All that shit that we done went through, now we got it
