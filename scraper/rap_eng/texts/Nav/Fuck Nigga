These niggas out here holdin'
These niggas out here holdin'
Wanna take my soul for a chain and some Jordans
These niggas petty, askin' me for favors and favors
Baby mama goin' through labor
Second time, I just ignored your call for the second time
'Cause you a fuck nigga
And that's the reason I can't fuck with you
'Cause you a fuck nigga
And you the reason I can't trust niggas
'Cause you a fuck nigga

'Member I was broke, I had nothin'
Juugin' and finessin', I was hustlin'
Why you only come when you want somethin'?
'Cause you a fuck nigga

'Cause you a fuck nigga

And when these bitches callin' me, they callin' me for money
Every time she fuck me, she always want somethin'
Word on the street bitches fuckin' for nothin'
Broke niggas hit, bitch you ain't even hustlin'
Fuck out my face talkin' 'bout your phone bill
I would've stayed around if you would've kept it real
Loggin' on Instagram on my phone, bitch you gotta go home

'Cause you a lame ho
Fuckin' for some petty change ho
'Cause you a lame ho
Postin' pictures for some fame ho
'Cause you a lame ho

'Member I was broke, I had nothin'
Juugin' and finessin', I was hustlin'
Why you only come when you want somethin'?
'Cause you a lame ho
'Member I was broke, I had nothin'
Juugin' and finessin', I was hustlin'
Why you only come when you want somethin'?
'Cause you a fuck nigga
