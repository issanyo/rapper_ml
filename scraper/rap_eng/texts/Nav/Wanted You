[Verse 1: NAV]
I'm ashamed of all the things that I was doing for you
Should've known that all these girls the same and they ain't loyal
She a freak, took her to Nobu, on a beach (yeah)
Just to eat, Louboutins all on her feet (yeah)
Where you get the money for them shoes, girl?
You hit me on my DM like a fangirl (whoa, whoa)
Did you want me or did you want these bands, girl? (whoa, whoa)
Now I know you just another Instagram girl (whoa, whoa)
She almost made me think that all she want is me (yeah)
I hit the club and she the first one that I see
Said that she there cause she know promoters in the club (yeah)
Come to find out that my homeboy hit her up (whoa, whoa, whoa)

[Chorus: NAV]
All this ice, I need a freezer, mhm
Whip it up, egg beater, mhm
Whipping up two-seaters
Said she love me, don't believe her, mhm
Can't be mediocre, mhm
Twenty on her choker, mhm
Fuck her, I don't know her, yeah
Give me face, like poker
Whoa, can't believe I wanted you
Whoa, I can't believe I wanted you, yeah
Girl, I can't believe I wanted you
Girl, I can't believe I wanted you

[Verse 2: Lil Uzi Vert]
No, no, no, no, I don't need you (I don't need you)
No, no, no, no, I don't need you (I don't need you)
Man, I swear these girls are see-through (translucent)
Stevie Wonder, I can't see you (can't do this)
She so hurt, I'm so irked, she get on my nerve (what?)
My head hurt, matter fact, kick her to the curb (bye-bye)
Found out that she with him, like this verse, get murked (huh?)
My chopper, eagle dispersed, yeah, probably die before it hurt, aye
Cartier lens, I'm on lurk, uh, twenty-thousand for a fur, ooh (yeah)
What would she do for a purse? (huh?) She said she'll give me a Perc' (thirty)
My new bitch better, so I cannot sweat her, don't talk to that girl, that's a curve (now what)
Speakin' of sweater, my neck is so frozen it looking just like an iceberg

[Chorus: NAV]
All this ice I need a freezer, mhm
Whip it up, egg beater, mhm
Whipping up two-seaters
Said she love me, don't believe her, mhm
Can't be mediocre, mhm
Twenty on her choker, mhm
Fuck her, I don't know her, yeah
Give me face, like poker
Whoa, can't believe I wanted you
Whoa, I can't believe I wanted you, yeah
Girl, I can't believe I wanted you
Girl, I can't believe I wanted you

[Verse 3: Lil Uzi Vert & NAV (both)]
Uzi they, used to make, fun of you (dress it up)

Whoa, little bitch, I'm done with you (I'm done with you)
Hit it from the back while Uzi stand in front of you (yeah)

I can't wife that girl, she fucked like twenty dudes (brown boy)
You can't get a kiss, can't get caught tonguing you (Lil Uzi)

Fuck a finger in that bitch, I use a thumb or two (yeah)
Made her number one and you ain't even number two

[Chorus: NAV & Lil Uzi Vert]
All this ice I need a freezer, mhm
