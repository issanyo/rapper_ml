[Chorus: Tory Lanez]
She don't dance but she dance for me
She ain't even tryna get these bands from me
Rollie shinin', that means it's bands to get
Shawty play your position, we gon' dance together
She don't dance but she dance for me (dance, dance)
She ain't even tryna get these bands from me (bands, bands)
Rollie shinin', that means it's bands to get (bands to get)
Shawty play your position, we gon' dance together (ooh, ooh, ooh)

[Verse 1: Tory Lanez]
Thumbin' through the bands and you dancin' (ooh, ooh, ooh)
I be flippin' yams but I'm handsome
Askin' if I dance when you dancin' (dancin')
I just say, "The gun is hard to dance with" (dance with)
Fuck you boys, I did this by my damn self (ooh, ooh, ooh)
I just fell in love with my bando (ooh, ooh, ooh)
I just fell in love with a bad one
I get in the club, sneakers glow up and I bagged 'em, this shit
All my boss bitches in Céline too (Céline, yeah)
She ain't wanna fuck me, she ain't mean to (she ain't mean it)
Diamonds dancin' on me and she dancin' on the pole
So I guess we both do the same thing too (ooh, ooh)

[Chorus: Tory Lanez]
She don't dance but she dance for me (dance, yeah)
She ain't even tryna get these bands from me (bands, bands)
Rollie shinin', that means it's bands to get (bands, yeah)
Shawty play out of position, we gon' dance together (ooh, ooh, ooh)
She don't dance but she dance for me (ooh, ooh, ooh)
She ain't even tryna get these bands from me
(all these bands on me)
Rollie shinin', that means it's bands to get
Shawty play your position, we gon' dance together

[Verse 2: NAV]
She dancin' on me 'cause she saw my diamonds dancin' (bling)
Love makin' music, takin' drugs my second passion
I know some bitches that stay ready for that action
I'm a boss and I'll pay you double what you askin'
She said some pussies in my city said they lookin' for me
Got a chicken in my kitchen and she cookin' for me
Got to B-Town, all these brown boys start to lookin' like me
I'm the one they wanna see, now all they bookin' is me
She hold me down so I ain't got time for no side hoes
She hold it down and she won't say shit to the 5-0
Blow it down like every week we smokin' 5 oz
If the doors don't go up, we don't want that Lambo (skrrt)

[Chorus: Tory Lanez]
She don't dance but she dance for me (dance, yeah)
She ain't even tryna get these bands from me (bands, bands)
Rollie shinin', that means it's bands to get (bands, yeah)
Shawty play out of position, we gon' dance together (ooh, ooh, ooh)
She don't dance but she dance for me (ooh, ooh, ooh)
She ain't even tryna get these bands from me
(all these bands on me)
Rollie shinin', that means it's bands to get
Shawty play your position, we gon' dance together

[Verse 3: Tory Lanez]
She go outta town every weekend (weekend)
See her out in public, we ain't speakin' (we ain't speakin')
Oh when we alone, it's a freak ting
When we get along, pants downs, no speak ting (yeah, yeah)
I been on the real nigga vibe with my .40
Why you gotta lie? You ain't my shortie
Actin' like you can but can't afford me
Hands down, get the bitches by majority (ooh, ooh, ooh)
I'm a rich nigga and you know it
Sippin' Hennessy, lil mama, pour it
I might even pull up and sip the Moët
And I pull up late nights, have you soakin', yeah

[Chorus: Tory Lanez]
She don't dance but she dance for me (dance, yeah)
She ain't even tryna get these bands from me (bands, bands)
Rollie shinin', that means it's bands to get (bands, yeah)
Shawty play out of position, we gon' dance together (ooh, ooh, ooh)
She don't dance but she dance for me (ooh, ooh, ooh)
She ain't even tryna get these bands from me
(all these bands on me)
Rollie shinin', that means it's bands to get
Shawty play your position, we gon' dance together

[Beat switch]

[Verse 4: Tory Lanez]
Dance for me, baby
She don't dance but she
Fuck around and dance for me, baby
She love to do it with no hands for me, baby
Might fuck around and take a chance on me, baby
Rappers spendin' they whole advance on you, baby
Rollie shinin', that means it's perfect timin', that mean it's
Time to get to throwin' these bands on you, baby
Hands on you, baby
Signature, my name, tramp stamp on you, baby
Robbin' that pussy, Van Dam on you, baby
Throw the money tall like a handstand
Do it for myself, one band man on it
I make her ride slow when she dancin' on it
I been sent on it, I been pimp on it
I know you so bad that my mans been on it, I
She gon' dance, she gon' dance for me
You only dance, only dance for me
Feel the adrenaline whenever you dance for me, yeah
Adrenaline rushin', adrenaline rushin'
