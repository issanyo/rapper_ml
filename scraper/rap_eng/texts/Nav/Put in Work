[Verse 1]
I'm ballin' like I'm an All Star
Smokin', I got the top jar
Now they wanna see me in a casket or in a cop car
I always wondered what it felt like to be rich (I wanna be rich)
It's cold outside, I put a Fendi scarf on my bitch (On my bitch)
Gucci on my toes, turn my friends to foes (Woah)
Always keep it close (Woah)
Turn that boy to toast (Woah)
Hop in that fast car, drivin' like NASCAR
Count all this cash, hard (Woah)
I need a black car (Woah)
Finally feel like I got everything that I want (I got everything)
Gave away my Polo shirts and got some Saint-Laurent
She turned out to be a groupie, can't believe I thought she was the one (What?)
Workin' until the moon go away, fuck every bitch under the sun

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm a walkin' light show, I just turned my wrist on (Bling)
Only make good music, diamonds big like Big Sean
I like my bitches short, ass fat and hair long
She know how to make some money, so I might just put her on

[Chorus]
I put in work, uh, baby put in work (Put in work)
Now put in work, uh, baby put in work (Put in work)
Lil' mama put in work, catch these ones, take off your shirt
Bend it over, twerk twerk
I know your body isn't yours, you should get your ass insured
Show me what you worth, baby put in work
I can tell when she ain't sure, that's when I be there for her
Don't think I still ain't watchin' you when I'm rollin' off a perc
Catch these ones, take off your shirt
Bend it over, twerk twerk

[Verse 2]
Gorillas and banana clips, I feel like King Kong
Fuckin' on a vegan chick, still got my mink on
I think that she a stripper, she got too much pink on
I serve her to my broski, hit it back like Ping Pong
I might sound cute, but girl you fuckin' with a thug
It's almost impossible to catch me sober off the drugs
The way she back it up, got these hunnids stackin' up
She don't let no one touch, unless they spendin' bucks
Jumpin' the vert, just me and Lil Uzi Vert
You might get hurt, reach for my chain and I'm liftin' my shirt
Oh, is that your girl?
You better know I hit it first
Really, that girl is the worst
I fucked her on Monday at work

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm a walkin' light show, I just turned my wrist on (Bling)
Only make good music, diamonds big like Big Sean
I like my bitches short, ass fat and hair long
She know how to make some money, so I might just put her on

[Chorus]
I put in work, uh, baby put in work (Put in work)
Now put in work, uh, baby put in work (Put in work)
Lil' mama put in work, catch these ones, take off your shirt
Bend it over, twerk twerk
I know your body isn't yours, you should get your ass insured
Show me what you worth, baby put in work
I can tell when she ain't sure, that's when I be there for her
Don't think I still ain't watchin' you when I'm rollin' off a perc
Catch these ones, take off your shirt
Bend it over, twerk twerk
