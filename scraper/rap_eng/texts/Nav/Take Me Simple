[Pre-Hook]
Driving down the 401 and I'm speeding
Basic bitches asking me what a bean is
Put her number in my phone and delete it
Put her number in my phone and delete it
My killers gorillas they roll with bananas
30 on waist, they won't run out of ammo
Ain't to much shit that my niggas can't handle
Ain't to much shit that my niggas can't handle

[Hook]
If you take me simple, I swear you won't take me simple again
If you take me simple, I swear you won't take me simple again
Catch me in the 6 with my day ones
We don't need no new friends
(If you take me simple, I swear you won't take me simple again no)

[Verse 1]
These youngins just said he needs laces for his Jordan 9s he ain't talking bout shoes
My killas they ballin, but they don't crossover, they stand on the corner and shoot
35 points, 10 assists
Went from passing a rock to a brick
I know Brazilians that hitting licks
I know some niggas that I fucked they bitch
I know some people who said they wouldn't switch, but they switch
I know some people who said they wouldn't snitch, but they snitch
But it's hard to see when there's a snitch in a nigga
But I can always tell a bitch in a nigga
I'm on the road to the riches lil nigga
I never get caught up on bitches lil nigga

[Verse 2]
These pussies rapping on road, but they singing in jail
My bro on the run, trynna stack up his bail
My pockets is low, I didn't want check the mail
Now that I'm up, man I'm giving em' hell
I just want money, I don't need these hoes
She see I'm getting money, she ain't know, now she know
She didn't wanna fuck with me when I was broke
Now I'm putting white girl in white girl's nose
She fuck with the kid cause she know Imma blow
Remember the days that I wore the same clothes
Remember the days sitting in Sdot
Look up to the sky and came up with a plot
All of my niggas, we chasing a knot
These niggas they wishing my music gon' flop (make your mind up)
Wanna make this money or not?
