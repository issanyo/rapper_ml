[Verse 1: NAV]
You lookin' for me, I'm with Preme in Calabasas
Sippin' lean and poppin' pills, no, I ain't fastin' (I ain't fastin')
This coupe a 2019, hope that I don't crash it
These bitches know I only hit 'em when I'm blasted
VVs dancing on me, that's just what that cash did
I hope that I can do what Abel and what Cash did
My ops are dead, I hope they rollin' in they casket (fuck 'em all)
I got a sack, I roll it up until my last spliff (roll it all)
What makes you think you better than the last bitch?
I'll never put all my eggs inside one basket
Walking off on my Postmates, I got my ratchet
I'm from the Rex, you know I won't hesitate to clap it

[Pre-Chorus: SAIF]
Bad bitch said she want a brown boy (boy)
Shuttin down yo city and yo town, boy (boy)
Ballin' every time we come around, boy (boy)
That's why shawty drop it to the ground (yeah)

[Chorus: SAIF]
To the ground, to the ground, to the ground for me
To the ground, to the ground, to the ground for me
To the ground, to the ground, to the ground for me
To the ground, to the ground, to the ground for me (swerve, swerve)

[Verse 2: Preme]
Bring them haters round me, I'ma go bezerk (go bezerk)
You ask about me, they gon' say I got that work (got that work)
I'm sorry, I cannot be faithful, I'm a flirt (I'm a flirt)
Fuck with the money, I'ma hit 'em where it hurt (bup, bup, bup)
Left the country, hit the road and got my money up (I'm just me)
Say one day she gonna leave me, well, bitch, hurry up (rest in peace)
Only call me when it's somethin' that you need (ayy, that you need)
I swear I always liked you better on your knees (ayy, woo)
I got a foreign bitch, she come from overseas (ayy, overseas)
Only English that she know is, "Daddy, please" (ayy, ayy)
I just dropped my top so everybody sees (skrrt, skrrt)
I don't fear no nigga, everybody bleeds (bup, bup, bup, bup, bup)
