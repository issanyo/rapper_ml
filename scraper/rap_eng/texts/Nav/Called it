I ignored your call because the money calling
Three years in the game and I'm already balling
I stay true to the game, and I stay solid
Always knew I would be at the top, I called it
I ain't got no time, my family never see me
My mama said she just seen me on TV
They know where she lives these kids be  [?] [?]
Tryna move her out the hood but it ain't easy
Went through some hard times so I had to make my wrist glow
I remember when we [?] work with Crystal
When she gets attached that's when it time to switch hoes
It cost me 10 racks every time I switch clothes
I can't wife no thot I need a rich hoe
Bought a bust down AP, cost me 6 foe
Told her I'm a freak but I don't lick toes
She said she tryna hit me but I switched phones
