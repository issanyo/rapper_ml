Diamonds
That's what we grind for
Diamonds
What these nigga be dyin' for
(All I want is diamonds)
Love the feeling on my neck
Diamonds
I remember when I couldn't afford
Diamonds
That's what we grind for
Diamonds
What these nigga be dyin' for
(All I want is diamonds)
Love the feeling on my neck
Diamonds
I remember when I couldn't afford

[Verse 1]
Fuck a job, I'm tryna get rich
Want to see the diamonds on my wrist
Get a little money, your family switch
(Remember when they thought I wasn't gonna be shit)
Now they wanna call me 'cause I got some change dawg
(Telling me, "you changed dawg")
I ain't doing this shit for the fame dawg
Just love when I put my chain on
The feeling that I get, when I'm laced up in Baguettes
On my watch got VVS, I remember being stressed
I had no diamonds, remember I couldn't afford
Work on the floor, I hope they don't kick in the door

[Verse 2]
I'm plottin' on makin' a mil
They askin', "Did he get a deal?"
These diamonds, they make niggas sick
They don't wanna see a young nigga get rich
For diamonds these bitches'll cry
For diamonds my niggas will ride
I'm tryna see MIA but none of my niggas can fly
I don't know why, these niggas ain't doing they time
These niggas tellin'
And most of my closest friends are convicted felons
With nothin' to lose and somethin' to prove
Try to take my ice, just imagine what they gon' do
Niggas gon' shoot
