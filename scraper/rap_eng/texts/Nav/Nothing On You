[Hook: Nav]
She say she tired of lies, she tired of the bullshit
She see me liking pictures bitches be posting
These other hoes ain't got nothing on you
No, no, no
Stop listening to your friends, when you coming home?
(No, no, no)
These other hoes ain't got nothing on you
(No, no, no)
These other hoes ain't got nothing on you

[Verse 1: Nav]
These hoes ain't real as you are
I remember you driving me around I had no car
Who you think imma split this bread with when I become a star?
If it wasn't for this music shit I'd probably be selling hard
She supported me, she told me dont be hitting no licks I'll give you all the money you need
I don't wanna see you die cause your the only nigga I need
And you listening to your friends they tryna throw some dirt on me
They don't wanna see you happy girl you know how these bitches be

[Hook: Nav]
She say she tired of lies, she tired of the bullshit

These other hoes ain't got nothing on you
No, no, no
Stop listening to your friends, when you coming home?
(No, no, no)
These other hoes ain't got nothing on you
(No, no, no)
These other hoes ain't got nothing on you

[Verse 2: Nav]
They say they seen me with another girl
Shawty you should know by now
That you my world
These bitches hate and they don't wanna see you do better than them
They tryna find you a good guy
But ill treat you better than him
He ain't got no guap, he ain't got no whip and I dress better than him
These girls they talking shit behind your back but I'm really your friend
But she don't wanna hear that shit so imma leave her alone
Said she gotta think about shit
I just hope that she come home

[Hook: Nav]
