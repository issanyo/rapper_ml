[Intro]
Southside
If Young Metro don't trust you, I'm gon shoot you

[Chorus: NAV]
Smoke a lot, got a permanent cough
Popping them pills again
Used to think you was my dog, now you are not my friend
Turn myself into a boss, I was born to win
Still know how to handle a loss
Me and Metro going in
Everything hit
All my songs hits
All my chains hit
I look like a lick
Everything hit
Diss me, you get hit
Southside got the stick
Everything hit

[Verse 1: NAV]
My shooter gave me a promise, said he won't miss
I'm rich, I'm just being honest, look at my wrist
You ain't shit, you ain't piss
20k ain't shit, spent that on my bitch
Roll up I smoke by the zip
Got gorillas, a jungle with me
Snakes and bees on my feet
Bought a Range 'cause I don't want a Jeep
Fucking your bitch for a week
I fuck your bitch right where you sleep
Leaving my nut in your sheets
Molly turned me into a beast
Working four days, no sleep

[Chorus: NAV]
Smoke a lot, got a permanent cough
Popping them pills again
Used to think you was my dog, now you are not my friend
Turn myself into a boss, I was born to win
Still know how to handle a loss
Me and Metro going in
Everything hit
All my songs hits
All my chains hit
I look like a lick
Everything hit
Diss me, you get hit
Southside got the stick
Everything hit

[Verse 2: NAV]
Water on my wrist
Codeine when I piss
Got pills in my shit
Don't think I could quit
Taking xannies to sleep
Wake up and I sip
There's a girl in my bed, and I don't know the bitch
I'm sipping juice, I make the yellow Fanta orange
I was stuck inside my house and now I'm touring
I couldn't do it, had to get it, life got boring
And now my clothes, my whip, and all my bitches foreign

[Chorus: NAV]
Smoke a lot, got a permanent cough
Popping them pills again
Used to think you was my dog, now you are not my friend
Turn myself into a boss, I was born to win
Still know how to handle a loss
Me and Metro going in
Everything hit
All my songs hits
All my chains hit
I look like a lick
Everything hit
Diss me, you get hit
Southside got the stick
Everything hit

[Outro]
I'm sipping juice, I make the yellow Fanta orange
I was stuck inside my house and now I'm touring
I couldn't do it, had to get it, life got boring
And I might close my whip, and all my bitches foreign
