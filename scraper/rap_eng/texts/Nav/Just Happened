[Chorus]
I just wanna hear you say you miss me
I know it hurts you every time you diss me
When I'm fucked up you the one I'm always hitting
When I lost you feel like I lost one of my kidneys
I did what you wanted, got these bitches off of me
I don't know why you stopped fucking with me
You gotta new man but you looked better with me
Don't act like you don't know me, I knew you since seventeen
I need you to trust me and believe in me

[Verse 1]
It happened one time on repeat
I just happened to find me a freak
Fruits of my labor, got a Georgia Peach
I just happened to take her with me
She just happened to get on her knees
She just happy she rollin' with me
I just had that bitch sign a release
I just happened to be from the streets
I just happened to start makin' beats
I just happened to turn out elite
I like the feeling of sand on my feet
So I brought a Draco to the beach
On my birthday she came home for me
Now I got her kids under my sheets
Brought her friend and she say she a freak
Now we bout to do something by the three
Fuckin' bitch after bitch
Got a sickness, I'm sick
I know your man isn't shit
I got his car on my wrist
Don't give any of these girls a kiss
Most likely I hit it and quit
You the only one that I miss

[Chorus]
I just wanna hear you say you miss me
I know it hurts you every time you diss me
When I'm fucked up you the one I'm always hitting
When I lost you feel like I lost one of my kidneys
I did what you wanted, got these bitches off of me
I don't know why you stopped fucking with me
You gotta new man but you looked better with me
Don't act like you don't know me, I knew you since seventeen
I need you to trust me and believe in me

[Verse 2]
It just happened that I never quit
It just happened that I hit a lick
When I was with you girl I wasn't shit
It just happened that I turned out rich
Shopping, stoppin' I pose for a pic
It just happened that I bought Fendi kicks
It just happened that I fucked that bitch
It just happened that I thought with my dick
Girl I'm sorry I broke your heart
But you knew how I was from the start
Now I feel like we driftin' apart
When I celebrate you should be a part
I just got my first song on the charts
I just bought my momma a car
I turned my home boys into stars
When I'm shopping I fill up my cart
You should be wit' me
Ride or die Bobby and Whitney
Signed with XO and now none of these labels can pimp me
Now I'm getting the money so simply
I just hope that you miss me

[Chorus]
I just wanna hear you say you miss me
I know it hurts you every time you diss me
When I'm fucked up you the one I'm always hitting
When I lost you feel like I lost one of my kidneys
I did what you wanted, got these bitches off of me
I don't know why you stopped fucking with me
You gotta new man but you looked better with me
Don't act like you don't know me, I knew you since seventeen
I need you to trust me and believe in me (believe in me, believe in me)
