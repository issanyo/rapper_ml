(Intro)
After all i've been through in my life
And all the young deaths, shootings and killings
I know theres a reason why I'm still here
It's just what it is
Aha

(Verse 1)
The reason why I rap, pack and stay strapped
Lay down on my stomach while mommy walk on my back
Jump into action ready for war
Or any type of bullshit that comes through any door
I'll blow you back with this hammer, no joke so laugh
I can't give you nothing nigga just smoke for cash
And if you fronting on money i'm a whip that ass
I'm a close the front door and do it with class
I'm still doing curls and various streches
Just incase I gotta get dirty and wretched
I'm not far from the streets though I live in the burbs
I'm an OG my dude still slapping the herb
Throwing trash out the window onto the curb
People looking at me like this nigga got the nerve
I keep it moving never let em' stop my swerve
And when they question my shit I just say "word"

(Chorus)
It's the reason why I live
The reason why I breathe
The reason why I feel
The reason why I'm real
The reason
Aha
The reason
The reason that I'm here
It's the reason why I live
The reason why I breathe
The reason why I feel
The reason why I'm real
The reason
Aha
The reason
The reason that I'm here

(Verse 2)
Don't ever have a reason to trust a stank hoe
First antwon walker then ochocinco
Get your money baby, trust me I know how it go
Only weak dudes seperate from they dough
The reason why I'm here and never smile in picture
Cause every single room got a handful of snitches
And I ain't never broke bread with tattletale bitches
So they never get a chance to hold onto my riches
I'm a full grown man with an african tan
And I still have visions of bodies stuffed in trashcans
Permanent scowl, I'm from murdapan
Wake up from them nightmeres, it's many murders man
Still spit the (?)
Gracefully getting older
My kids warm my heart, my enemies keep it colder
I love this shit, it's a gift or a curse
Cut to the graveyard get hit by a hearse
I lost my pops and my man guru
The legacy continues i'm a do what I do
And trust me little man we ain't forgot about you
But you want the legal system to do what it do
But we street niggas so we breathe the steets
And when we so your little ass you got to get that ass speed
I'm still here and I promise that we'll get even
Cause this here is the motherfucking season
The reason!
