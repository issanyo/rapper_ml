Fuck around lay around do or die (Repeat x3)
"You figgedy fuck around you lay around"

Word to Joe Frazier got ta do what pays ya
Give a nigga pain like dysplasia
But close your hips in nigga you can't win
I walk around with a scowl and a grin
Parties try to rock me chicks try to clock me
Niggas try to block me but they can't stop me
I'm a bad man understand where I come from
Treatin' niggas dumb, as I drink my rum
I'm a mad man, I get respect with the Tec
Put punks in check, Shug's on the set
I'm the one with the game, the twelve round
Crack to the concrete, from the underground
I'm a bad nigga, how do you figure to take me
You cannot break me, so don't mistake me
For your brother, I'm not a punk motherfucker see
I did my time, and now I'm free
I'm a dope one, ready to rip and wreck shop
I will not stop, I won't be dropped by the cops
I'm bad, understand me with the game I kick
I got crazy bitches like a Trojan on my dick

Yo Hobb we got more rep than Lucky Luciano
Suckers we wet to the sound of the dope piano
This is something you can't handle, here's one example
I got your head as a trophy up on the mantle
Each and every sect we wreck, the crowd's electrified
Mystified, you get dissed, when you try, you die
Fish niggas, they get fried upon my skillet
I kill it, fuck it, my shit is on hit
And hittin' you blaow (BLAOW) so what you want to do now?
You stepped up, I whacked ya, you crept up, I smacked ya
Got infinite length, with the strength of a real master
If you don't bow down now you'll get plowed down now
You know, like POW
Fuck around, lay around, do or die (Repeat x3)
So fuck around, lay around, do or die
Fuck around, lay around, do or die (Repeat x2)
"You figgedy fuck around, you lay around"

Word to Mike Tyson, hit you quick like lightnin'
Swing my left jab first, and then come in with the right
Cold deck ya, nah I could never respect a
Punk like you, you get dropped like one two
And you're out son, just like a one round bout son
The outcome, is that you'll get that ass hung
Easily, swiftly, you'ew stupid you can't get with me
Fuck around, lay around, do or die (Repeat x2)
I said fuck around, lay around, do or die

Fumin! Hey, I'm boomin' down on niggas
I figure, how could they take out a big nigga
They don't know, so I don't never give em a clue
That's you and you and you, and oh yeah you
You can't get with this or take me down
I'm always laughin' haha 'cause you punks are clowns
Since I'm passin' emcees, with my skill
I'm up on the hill, and I force them dudes to chill
Rippin' up shit as I do, because I'm violent
That's why when I walk in the room, punks are silent
My name is Shug, as if you didn't know
I'm pimpin' hard, and punks are just a hoe
Fuck around, lay around, do or die (Repeat x2)
I said you fuck around, lay around, do or die
Fuck around, lay around, do or die
I said you fuck around, lay around, do or die
Fuck around, lay around, do or die (Repeat x2)
"You figgedy fuck around, you lay around"

Yea yea that's Shug for ninety-three
I want to say whattup to all my people, yaknowhatI'msayin?
We got the Guru in the house, and my man Lil' Dap
Showin' motherfuckers where we're truly at
I want to say whattup to my homegirl, my main girl and my kids
Whassup Kerry, Marie and Lisa how y'all chillin'?
I know y'all in the motherfuckin' house too, yea!
I like to say whattup also, to all the peoples back home
That know what time it is, and the niggas tryin' to get real
And on that note, right
I'ma get the fuck up out of here
"You figgedy fuck around, you lay around"
