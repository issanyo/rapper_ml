(Intro)
Yeah, yeah, you know
You gotta make money out here today
It don't matter how you make your money
You know what I'm saying
Cause we all got to get paid
Word is born

(Chorus)
Word to joe frazier got to do what pays ya
Got to do what pays ya
Word to joe frazier got to do what pays ya
Got to do what pays ya

(Verse 1)
When I was young pimping was the shit
I knew that when I grew up I would be apart of it
Fly clothes, driving in eldorados
Fat stacks of dough everywhere I go
Everyone knows my name, so what I'm in a dirty game
Somebody gotta keep it sane
At least I'm not sticking needles in my arm
Or being a kingpin like don juan
Drinking dom p√©rignon staying smooth
Trying to get my cash on, trying to keep the move
One step ahead of five o
So I can keep this flow, I gotta keep the dirty dough
Don't knock the way I get paid
Cause if I worked at mc donalds I would get played
So I be in the street for the rest of my life
Keeping razor sharp like a knife

(Chorus)
Word to joe frazier got to do what pays ya
Got to do what pays ya
Word to joe frazier got to do what pays ya
Got to do what pays ya

(Verse 2)
In 88 I used to sell cocaine at conways
Made about four grand a day
Now this type of loot made me the man
I was the target in murderpan
I used to have mad chicks wanna ride the dick
I had the flyest of suits my shit was slick
I used to drive around with mad fake friends in my benz
And I was getting crazy ends
But one day all of that came to an end
Cause one snitch flipped up and became a bitch
And told five o my moves
But I got to win cause I never lose
Now they think that I might go upstate
I'm gonna make it kid I still get my papes
And when I get out imma still get down
Peace to pablo escobar and nino brown

(Chorus)
Word to joe frazier got to do what pays ya
Got to do what pays ya
Word to joe frazier got to do what pays ya
Got to do what pays ya

(Verse 3)
It seems like in 95
The only way you survive is to get a 9 to 5
But imma still try to keep my life fly
And manifest life and try to step right
And even though my head wants to tell me left
I got to try and move on without the petty theft
But I still got the hustle in my heart
And the streets will always be apart
Of who I be and what I be and what I choose to be
I got to still get the money
And love the sin of dead presidents
And I can't stop because I got to pay my rent

(Interlude)
So, all the hustlers out there
And all the street players
You know what I'm saying?
And all those trying to move ahead
This is all for you
You gotta keep getting your dough
Whether you're working a job
Whether you're walking the streets
Whether you out there like that
You know what I'm saying?
Keep it real, baby!
Make money

(Chorus)
Word to joe frazier got to do what pays ya
Got to do what pays ya
Word to joe frazier got to do what pays ya
Got to do what pays ya
Got to do what pays ya
Got to do what pays ya
Word to joe frazier got to do what pays ya
Got to do what pays ya
Word to joe frazier got to do what pays ya
