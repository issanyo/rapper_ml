(Intro:)
Yeah man, all I'm sayin is
Just play the music, play all of the music man
We gotta keep some balance in the game
You know? Let it play man, for real

Uuhuuh, Big Shug, Primo
You know the deal
Just play these records man, all of em
DJs, all around the world

(Verse 1:)
This year, I'm not fuckin with coward cats
Who hide behind they raps and flashy Cadillacs
Scared of the battle raps and semiauto gats
But wanna push wack rhymes _ official cats
Who wanna feel the purple haze and sparks with cattle graze
Swimmin pool with dime chicks, spendin happy days
With all my niggas, blaze, honey dips gets glazed
And I'm paid a hundred grand when I hit the stage
This is not a phase, its a real niggas wage
And I'ma make sure I get it before I'm back in the cage
I promise to shoot and blaze, till my dyin days
Till DJ stan and my musics played
Any beef with me will end in castastrophe
I'm winnin while you losin, thats how it just has to be
From the vinyl, to the cd j
Give the fans a chance to hear the fly shit I say
Play the record or get smacked clean
With anotha bangin joint from Big Shug and DJ Prim

(Chorus 1)
(Play it) play it (play it) play it (play it) play it (play it) play it
(play it) play it (play it) play it
Let the music play, hey
(You know we get down)
Let the music play, hey
(On the microphone)
Let the music play, hey
(Rhymes flowin like water)
Let the music play, (hip hop) everyday
Let the music play, hey
(You know we get down)

(...record is massive evidence, of the flexibility and toughness of the
Principles you profess)

(Verse 2:)
I do it all to show my skills, till pushin dafidills
I be on the roof tops, accurate for the kill
From old school to new school dudes, I set the tone
I'm a vocal, crush and do other things to your bones
When I face my enemies, I creep like a centipide
Smoke that angel _ while I'm spittin that 16
The games been a hunch, referee true and lunch
I spit the hottest fire, and always pack a punch
Play the record or get your station smothered
Or get your head popped off like Sadaam Hussein brother

(Chorus 2:)
Play it (play it) play it (play it) play it (play it) play it (play it) play
It (play it, play it, play it)
Let the music play, hey
(You know we get down)
Let the music play, hey
(On the microphone)
Let the music play, hey
(Rhymes flowin like water)
Let the music play, (hip hop) everyday
Let the music play

(Outro:)
All I'm sayin DJs, around the world, let the music play man
All the music ain't got to sound the same
This is Big Shug, DJ Primo, what could be better?
Let that music play man, for real
Street champ, I'm gone
