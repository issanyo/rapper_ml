[Intro: Big Shug talking]
Yeah its time for me to step up and get me a piece of this mutherfuckin pie
Yah nam sayin, I know you cats been waitin for the real
Thats all I know, on this track somethings about to get broke up
You got to respect that
Its only right
Word up

[Verse One: Big Shug]
I rock for niggas that box, pull triggers on Glocks
Hang out all day on hot blocks
When you yell "lets go" they don't stop
Their soul mission is to be on top
This is a score for soldiers of war
And veteran rap crews that go on world tours
I stay lyrically fit to beat the shit
Out of compit-ish that wish to flip
I'm comin through like 2 blows
Crack your clavicle
Hot like calicos, outta control
I throw vicious hooks and upper cuts
To knock you on ya butt I'm in your face screaming "what"
And you supposed to be hard
You get chased by attack dogs, up trees through backyards
Guru hit me on the hip, there's gonna be some shit
So grab your team and battleship
I'm bombin shit like NATO, you wanna play yo?
I crush that ass like tomatoes
Forever it be me and Gu'
It ain't a mutherfuckin thing you cats can do
And what, what what what
Counter punch and what
And what what what
Counter punch and what

[Hook]
"The shit gets drastic they learn when I hit them"
Niggas be near the stage ice grillin and posted up
They don't know niggas with us be holstered up
Ready to toast it up, they try to approach
But they can't quite get..close enough
Or they bound niggas snuffed
Counter punch counter punch believe that
"The shit gets drastic they learn when I hit them"

[Verse Two: Guru]
Its too late in the game for us to choke
And you don't want to provoke these OG's to go for broke
We got outta state cat peelers, ex crack dealers
Ex cons, dons and macs that stack skrilla
And now we're splittin the pie
Bustin off a lick in the sky
Soon as I'm spittin you die
Instantly, you just a wimp to me
My man Premier orchestrates the breaks on this symphony
And now you know you should respect your fathers
I'm understanding god as we continue this saga
Me and my nigga Shug, go hood to hood
Understood, you tryin a buy props
Thats why you riding the wood
Its all good, from Blue Hill Ave to Humbolt
Right here to NYC blazing trails like gun smoke
Some toke, others be ready to fight ya
See more beef than butchers
Beat you down or just snipe ya
Counter punch

[Hook]

[Verse Three: Big Shug]
I get you cats in a verbal crossfire
Then cock my hand back and slap the hell fire outta liars
Chill out in cockpits, puff fly with pilots
Acquire frequent flyer mileage
All black on, shoes sway violet
No matter how you flip it dunn, I stay stylish
The girl I'm wit you dream to get between her
While I be on tour walkin the beaches of Ipanema
See my nina, you run and hide
So id rather get the drop then punch you dead in the eye
You scarred of me, you outta be, cause basically
You just another wack ass MC
I'm deadly, sickenin like the flu
You got 2 hours get out the game or you through
So, come front and I will bust your circumference
Big Shug ain't ever havin, none of that nonsense
Pass the word to ya team we out to lunch
And they can't withstand the mighty blow of the counter punch
And what, what what what
Counter punch and what
And what, what what what
Counter punch counter punch

"the shit gets drastic
They learn when I hit them"
