(Intro: Big Shug)
My son, trumayne

(Verse 1: Trumayne)
Kid of the year, son of the century
When it comes to future, million years you better mention me
I'm on the right track, i'm a wiz at math
English and science too I always got the fats
Young b baller I pull out the stash
Some coaches don't know so they hold me back
But I'm ready to play like a drama class
Hitting you in the post giving you whiplash
At the foul line you know I'm cold cash
Ya'll can't see me cause you dry ash
And all you fake rapper football head stooze
I'm 6'4 forteen big young dude
And when I'm on the move I blow raps up
Foes get tapped out wrapped up and shipped out
You tripping cause trumayne slipping
I'm jordan at this thing, ya'll scottie pipplen's
And i'm ripping, flipping when I'm dunking
Keeping the streets funking
I'm just too good

(Outro: Big Shug)
Develop greatness
Son of big shug, trumayne
The legacy continues
Gangstarr foundation goes on
