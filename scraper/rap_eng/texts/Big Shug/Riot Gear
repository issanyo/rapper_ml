[Intro: Termanology]
*They better have the riot gear ready*
Yeah
Check it out
They promised us change
I want real change
The only thing that changed is the face of the common enemy
Yeah
Different face, same agenda
It's a war
Yeah

[Hook: Trademarc]
Get your riot gear
We all [?] of pain and punishment
Fame is [?] when the government aim
It's to blame all of us in the rap game
I ain't even having none of it
Get your riot gear
We all [?] of pain and punishment
Fame is [?] when the government aim
It's to blame all of us in the rap game
I ain't even having none of it

[Verse 1: Termanology]
Ayo, ain't shit changed since the Bible days, we still
Lie and frame people that get paid and rely on the government to tell us the way
We gonna live, gonna think and we gonna behave
Like modern day slaves and what about aids
Given to us to keep the death toll raised
And I got my gauge, cause I'ma fight back
If they think I'ma [?]
City's under attack, like Iraq
Kids are crying tears, cops in riot gear
But I don't fear shit, pussy I'm fearless
Since I can't fix shit I'ma just flip shit
We got bulletproofs too, fuck your blue suits
[?] bluetooth murdering our hood youth
Even if we got proof, they still gon' walk
So I'ma leave you in chalk with this thing right here

[Hook: Trademarc]
Get your riot gear
We all [?] of pain and punishment
Fame is [?] when the government aim
It's to blame all of us in the rap game
I ain't even having none of it
Get your riot gear
We all [?] of pain and punishment
Fame is [?] when the government aim
It's to blame all of us in the rap game
I ain't even having none of it

[Verse 2: Singapore Kane]
I'm still [?] the US voted for Obama
But the changes that hit my hood [?] cause I still got drama
I'm 730 I'm 420 without no scholar
And the cops look at me like I hid Osama
Profound cause I've been to the East and I ain't afraid of the beast
My scars resemble a terrorist fleece
We go up hating police cause they kill us in getaway
Everyday mom's eyes water like pepper spray
Fuck what the papers say, cause most of them are bias
You call us terrorists, the people call us freedom fighters
They like to [?] views sort of like Fox News
Fuck Bill O'Reilly for real his shit is not news
Our country's a wreck cause politicians copping feels from interns and [?] popping pills
Can't [?] up to fear cause there's [?] little here
We throwing rocks at the cops wearing the riot gear

[Hook: Trademarc]
Get your riot gear
We all [?] of pain and punishment
Fame is [?] when the government aim
It's to blame all of us in the rap game
I ain't even having none of it
Get your riot gear
We all [?] of pain and punishment
Fame is [?] when the government aim
It's to blame all of us in the rap game
I ain't even having none of it

[Verse 3: Big Shug]
Gimme 50 cats with masks, weapons and tear gas
I promise you we'll find Osama's ass
Get deep in [?] snatch your [?] and show you that it's all a game
Politics is all tricks like David Blaine
While my inner city fight through rough terrain
I'm from the hood and I ain't never been a liar
And none of my peeps ever died from friendly fire
Pitbulls are our favorite dogs cause we don't want no Portugese waterdogs
Government is all snakes and rats who ain't never felt the kickback from a hard gat
It's easy to tell other cats what to do
I done been bars hard for years with my crew
Dance to my old drum and stay steady
Coming for us? Get your riot gear ready

[Hook: Trademarc]
Get your riot gear
We all [?] of pain and punishment
Fame is [?] when the government aim
It's to blame all of us in the rap game
I ain't even having none of it
Get your riot gear
We all [?] of pain and punishment
Fame is [?] when the government aim
It's to blame all of us in the rap game
I ain't even having none of it

[Outro]
*Six days of rioting left behind scenes reminiscent of war-torn cities. More than a hundred square blocks were decimated by fire and looters and few buildings were left intact. Firemen were harassed by snipers and brick-throwing hoodlums as they attempted to control the fires, many of which were left to burn themselves out. Firemen were later issued flak suits of bulletproof mesh to protect them from snipers who continued to shoot from rooftops. It took the appearance of 14000 troops to bring an end to what leaders called "insurrection by hoodlums". Leaders were quick to deplore the unbridled lawlessness, a curfew was put into effect and the entire section declared off limits to all but residents*
