[Big Shug]
Hip-Hop, after me there'll be nothin else
That's real
Uh-huh

I Cold Crush 'em like them Brothers
Disrespect me, get your whole team smothered
I'm still Cool like J
Smoke two L's, at the crib, then I hit Shante
I'm still D.M.C., I Run this whole game
Like cats with my sons, uh-huh
I'm Public Enemy #1
I'm like Malcolm near the window with a black shotgun
I'm the best to do, you ain't got a Clue
But you claim to be Fabolous, you ain't taggin us
You too weak, you got your brain on dust
I got that new chrome cocked back with no rust
I'm like O.J., you wonder if I did it
But I don't roll with snitches so you'll never find out
Know the history, you'll know yourself
Stick to your guns nigga and you'll keep your wealth
But check your rod, and you'll keep your health
When they come with short money, let the heater melt 'em
I'm not here to make friends, it's just dough
Hip-Hop, created my flow
I give 'em drymouth at the end of the barrel
The odds of you escapin, are next to narrow
Follow the rhyme from the master
Cause when the hip-hop is done, there'll be no after, after

[Hook: repeat 2X]
After me there'll be no real
After me there'll be no 38 steel
But there'll be plenty of corny-ass cats
Who want us to believe they raps and that's whack

[Big Shug]
That's whack
