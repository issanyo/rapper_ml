[Big Shug]
Hey ma, I like how you wiggle
I like how you giggle, I wanna dig your middle
But right now, I got business to tend to
Take some loot, and your friends to the bar too
I'ma catch up with you much later
But right now, I got a problem that's much greater
There's some cats in here from out of town
Who must've forgot, how I get down
I'ma ask questions, then slap money
If he come out of his mouth with somethin funny
This is my turf, my territory
Real rhymes, and real rap stories
You ain't movin drugs in here BITCH
I throw your ass down the back stairs and still get rich
No plots, no takin over blocks
Front on us and get shot, it's too hot

[Chorus: Big Shug]
Take it out the microwave, it's too hot
Take it out the microwave it's too, hot
Take it out the microwave, it's too hot
Take it out the microwave it's too, hot
Take it out the microwave, it's too hot
Take it out the microwave it's too, hot
Take it out the microwave, it's too hot
Get your man out of the spot, it's too hot

[Big Shug]
I'm a grown-ass man with a grown-ass plan
I roll with "The Ownerz" bitch, straight from Murderpan
There'll be trouble now, these niggas is comin armed
That's cool, cause my niggas is tossin bombs
Hey snitch nigga, sing for me now
Barrel in your mouth, tears comin out
Your team scared, they runnin out
You been pussy, your life's runnin out
Girl shake that ass, without a doubt
While I walk this punk nigga out
And take the product out the microwave
And when I get back, we bag it up and get paid
It's too hot

[Chorus] - second half only

[Big Shug]
Now we got, the house cleaned out
The body's gone, work shipped out
Time to par-tay, without a doubt
Chicks go 'head and scream, niggas turn it out
You know the name, Big Shug
Let the shots be heard, all around your fuckin hood
Lame cats, and fake pop divas
Get hit with shots from the chrome body freezer

And my advice to all you cornball muh'fuckers
Is to get out the game, right now (get out the game)
Shug's comin through, it's been about time
Put the drinks down, and get the product out the microwave
It's too hot up in here
Let the beat roll right there, uhh uhh uhh
