[Verse 1: Ed O.G]
I sat back and took a look, but son got stole like a crook
Yo he shook, we into every cranny and nook, so look
You'll get open like a book in the library
Where niggas lie and die heavy in the 'bury
So sons I roll with, I throw with
If shit unfolded, unravel, who rolled it?
Hold it, to the tips til its burnin'
Couldn't feel the gap in my bamboo, dogs wasn't churnin'
But the world keeps turnin'
From Dorchester, to Matapan, to Mount Vernon
Yo the city life be intense
You can get jumped like a fence ghetto thirst being quenched
Where niggas mob like the lynch, rob like the grinch who stole christmas
Don't get yourself dismissed
Or get crumbled like tissue
I see through your crew like crystal
Lets make it official

[Verse 2: Scientifik]
It's the return of the dragon who keep his pants saggin'
Write more shit than the graffiti artists taggin' in the trainyard
My mental weapons leave your brain scarred
The edo flow will keep it real you never change god
The mic controller powerful like ayatollah
Shine like solar, who could get caught like I was polar
Hard just like a molar tooth, a hundred proof
Like some yukon jack, cause the true don's back
I just gotta get paid, make sure that J get made
You get sprayed like windex, when I flex the index
Finger, you'll be dead like a ringer
Its only Scientifik got his song like singer
Control your whole shit, yous a fraction like 3/10
Bring your brigade and get played like defense
You been a G since you heard about spice one
A lot of rappers got guns I have to slice one
When I sneak up in the party with my razor
Plus I got a crew that could burn with the blazers
And leave a trail of blood all the way to portland
Organized on the side never go to court and
You know I have an empire when I strike back
Im havin sneaky niggas sayin sci's like that

[Verse 3: Big Shug]
On the microphone I'm surprising
I'm burning down MC's houses like that chick did Andre Rison
Still keeping them off balance, they can't challenge
Their whole shit is absent or malice
It's Big Shug I'm the best in the game
I'm running up lanes, I got the power of a freight train
I hit ya in the chin, chin to head, head to ground
Boom, when I knock your ass down
'95 the brand new sound, from a new town
With mad brothas to get down
We should have had ours by now
So if you stand in the way catch the cock back blaow!
I keep the mad lyrical
And if you fuck up,then I'll be singing at your funeral
It's not the way to go out
But when we come about
We tearing niggas the fuck up and kicking 'em out
And maintain and keep it real
Knowing the rhythm of steel and make sure you all feel
It's a B-O-S-T-O-N thing
And we come with mad drama to bring
When we shoot, we won't mis-shoot, hate to have to diss you
But this year, its official
Yea

[Outro]
Now hold up, let's make this official (4x)
