"Black cream"

[Hook] [Big Shug] (Reks)
From chains to whips
To chains and whips
Hopped off the slave ships into the fly kicks
Floss our ice, gettin' paper
All my niggas want paper
We just gotta get paper
(We bought your American Dream
The negro epidemic, black cream)
Black cream

[Verse One] [Reks]
Dear Oprah Winfrey
I know misogyny
Is rampant in our music and it pains you severely
But Dear Ms. Billion Dollar Income
Hear me
The path to success isn't merely:
Respect self, sincerely, remember Celie?
Slaved after mister
And when she disobeyed then he whipped her
Well we was picked up, broke down, whipped up
Said, "Thanks" to master when he tipped us
Upon tree, lift us
Noose as a necktie
Excuses, I guess I
Use cause I refuse to let my
Ego be abused by the stereotype
That blacks just might be better off as have nots
Than to have cops, harass us
Poor Jacqueline Onassis
Husband gunned down, supporting our black asses
We as poor folks frown upon a brother's success
The more he has, then we have less
And we have yet, been able to afford
Without buying the store
Instead of repair, get all the white Airs
Force 1/one to look in the mirror
And be ashamed as the truth appears
Nigga, negro, Afro, hero
To the youth who want to rhyme for deniro
And shine like them joints in the earlobes
The pain I've seen
Watchin' my people spend they black cream

[Hook] [Big Shug] (Reks)
From chains to whips
To chains and whips
Hopped off the slave ships into the fly kicks
Floss our ice, gettin' paper
All my niggas want paper
We just gotta get paper
(We bought your American Dream
The negro epidemic, black cream)
Black cream

[Verse Two] [Reks]
Everybody ain't Kanye West lord
I tell the kids, get a dream you can afford
But kids want stunts, smoke blunts and impress broads
Sip on syrup cause they idol got his cup
What this does
Is make it harder to give a fuck
The impulse
To ball got Cosby pissed off
That "buck that bought the bottle
Coulda struck the lotto"
To invest in scratch tickets is a fucked up motto
Dress our autos, barely dress our kids
Some want Tims, but he gon' wait
Daddy need new rims
Damn
Did I write that right?
Question is
Are you gonna right that wrong?
Put my mic back on
Free speech is tell a nigga 'bout a nigga's self
You poor knowledge even if you got dumb wealth
Poor knowledge?
Dumb wealth?
All the money in the world, your black ass can't spell help

Chains and whips to chains and whips
Right into the latest kicks
And we
Floss our ice
Brush off haters
Black man's plight
Lusting paper
(We just gonna get paper)
We bought your American dream
The negro epidemic, black cream
(Black cream)
"Black cream"

[Big Shug singing]
Heeeey
Stay on your grind baby
Brush off the haters
Remain a player
Gettin' this paper
Black cream, yeeeeah
Black cream, yeeeeah
Gettin' this paper
Gettin' this paper
Black cream

[Outro] [Big Shug talking]
Big Shug. Reks. This is how we get down man
Cats is fightin' for money out there
We gotta keep it movin' man. One way or the other. I'm out
