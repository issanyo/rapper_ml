(feat. Big Shug)

Don't take it personal

Big Shug, Singapore, we bring it to you live
Is what it is man, it's what we do, feel me

[Verse 1: Singapore Kane]
It's Like being affected by a virus, surrounded
By pirates
Uncomfortable, like wool sweaters in hot climates
Cats say they wanna be friends
But I don't buy it
I'm quiet cause' nobody get as noted as I get
I don't claim to f*ck with tarel cards and I ain't psychic
But with eyes opened wide I can see the surprises
So everything surprise me, but nothing surprise me
I see the hate spreading like it's poison ivy
So I choose friends wisely
I know who despise me I know who's looking out
I know who just wanna try me, I know who's speaking from the heart
I know who's grimey, I know who take the stand to sing like eisley
It's ya eyes that portray you telling me that your shystie
Try to be cool with me so you can get at my wifey
Now the friendships tainted, look at the picture I painted
For those that don't get it, this is how I'll explain it

[Chorus: x2]
I don't got time to sit around and pretend like me
And you was gonna to be friends don't take it personal
I make Ends only for me to spend. So if I ain't really tryin' to
Lend

[Verse 2: Singapore Kane]
Who do you trust when everybody in this world is corrupt
When insurance is at stake no-one don't give a f*ck, people
Laff at ya dreams, say it's best to give up but you can only, live
Once so, I just say live it up, I make money for me and work hard for myself
Dog, that's why I'm adamant about protecting my wealth dog, long as I got health dog
I'm a keep spittin' hot shit, so my CD won't sit on the shelf dog, you either with me or against
Part of my French but f*ck you for taking a mile, I gave an inch, chicks be staring at the mirror
All day, thinking they fly, and I don't say hi, she die to know why, I'm sorry I can't sweat you
Baby, but I bet you been told by silly ass dudes, you really special, I still respect you, but my log ain't
Working you, cause' you ain't earned that spot baby, don't take it personal

[Chorus x2]

[Verse 3: Big Shug]
You say they'll hook you up, cause you from the hood, bottom line nigga, is you are not good
They tell me let the song speak for itself, and with the proper shit behind you, you can get to the wealth
Just rhyme on beat, time after time, dig deep in the streets and stay on ya grind, just because you look the part, and push weights off ya chest, rock a wife beater, got two guns and a vest, four cats around you, who say you're the best, you still wack as hell, more or less, see I tell it like it is, I'm deep hearted, I get gangsta
Like that movie, departed, I'm from murder path, where I learned to go hard, I came up with Irvin james and walked to hilly yard, Jose, Pee Wee, and Bee Fee, I still bill hard on murder path's legacy, so when ya see me save ya CD's I'm only part of the puzzle not the industry, HOMIE!
