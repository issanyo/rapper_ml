[Big Shug]
Hear me, DJ, hear me
Big Shug from the underground, feel me?
Hear me! Uhh, hear me
Big Shug baby, here we go

You don't play my music, so you play what's hollow
The music that the simple people can follow
With the nursery rhyme most designed for the clown dancin
Stick around for 10 years, what are the chances?
I'll tell you next to nothin, I'm not bluffin
And you'll be relieved of your scratchin and cuttin
You corny anyway you no heart DJ
Why the program directors tell you what to play
But you front on air, tryin to say what's hot
But you got police escorts to the parking lot
Don't get me wrong some DJ's keep it real
And know exactly how Big Shug feel
This is the deal, play the crook music f'real
I represent how all the underground feel
Don't be scared, come see despair
Guns drugs hoes, flippin everywhere
Hard workin people tryin to make a buck
Young wild ass niggas who don't, give a fuck
In the words of the late, great, Headquarters
Head up, eyes and ears open
Niggas bring the rope in, let's do these muh'fuckers
'Til they hear what we got to say, hear me~!

[Hook: repeat 2X]
It is what it is, hear, what I'm sayin
All my cats who get amped up and start to sprayin
Don't make us come see you, we not playin
Or they'll find your body deep in the woods decayin

[Big Shug]
Hear me DJ? I don't drink Haterade
Spots around the world my music's still played
So what I'm sayin, is get e'ryone paid
E'rybody on stage, e'rybody backstage
And if they whack the crowd'll let 'em know
Youse a DJ you don't control the show
Cause you fucked up careers, and don't even know
That's why niggas stomp you out, at your show
And you fake promoters, tryin to pay that short money
It's 2006, niggas is not dummies
You will be haunted, Malibu's Most Wanted
Don't make me scare your punk-ass white, that's right
I've been doin this for 13 years
Many come and go but I've still got my career
That's cause I keep it real
And I'm underground - hear me~!
