[Intro]
It's shuggy diamonds
Yeah what's up baby
Shuggy diamonds
I'm here to save the day
I know you lookin' down and you need a big man to hold you
Take care of you, make you feel safe
That's why Shuggy Diamonds is here
So listen baby, you wanna take a ride with me
Let me change your life, you feel me?

[Verse 1]
Shuggy Shug, I'm the diamond man
You need me everyday in your life, like vitamins
Original player, never by the man
You's a cartoon nigga, like Spiderman
Shuggy Diamond, gators and furs
Spit the game nice, speech never slur
Diamond frame glasses, vision never blurred
I'm Hip-Hop nigga, so I still say word
Pushin' tricked out whips with fat rims
Diamond stutted timbs for me and my friends
Drinks for everyone, I got this round
The game's still the same, pimps up and hoes down

[Chorus]
I am Shuggy Diamonds, yeah
And I play this game for real
And I play this game to win
I am Shuggy Diamonds, ay
And I play this game for real
And I play this game to win

[Verse 2]
Shuggy Diamonds, I'm a girl's best friend
Especially if you like real big men
To hold you up with both feet in the air
Love juice's flowin just about everywhere
There's some haters, that just want me to fall
'Cause I play the game a bit better than y'all
A bit smoother than y'all
And guess what, Shuggy Diamonds ain't never hatin' on y'all
No dramas, trip to the Bahamas
Sippin' Coladas with all the baby's mamas

[Bridge]
Yeah tell Fantasia that baby mama journey was hot
I love the baby mamas
You know what I'm saying with that sexy lips and eroticness
You know what I mean
Just take care of your lips, feet, body, have your skin toned right
And Shuggy Diamonds, I don't never discriminate
All y'all can get down, you feel what I'm sayin'
It's Diamonds baby
And I'm out

[Chorus]
I am Shuggy Diamonds, yeah
And I play this game for real
And I play this game to win
I am Shuggy Diamonds, ay
And I play this game for real
And I play this game to win

[Outro]
It's Diamonds baby, it's, it's Diamonds baby
It's Diamonds baby, it's, it's Diamonds baby, what?
It's Diamonds baby, it's, it's Diamonds baby
It's Shuggy Diamonds baby
