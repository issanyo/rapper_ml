[Intro 4x: Scratches by DJ Premier]
"The real"

[Verse 1]
In this rap game, you ain't never been able
You've been slapped in the face and kicked under the table
And I don't even know how that feels
I'm too quick to flex the steel upon you dead off your heels
You's a millionaire, I'll say that's fair
Without that hip-hop yeah, you's a motherfucking square
You pay niggas just to calm your fears
But step aside when you see real niggas here
And your man is a comedian
Think I remember him upstate, his name was Zan
He was intrigued by the drugs and the steel
But had no idea on what's really real

[Hook]
What's really real?
What's really real?
You don't know
You don't know

[Verse 2]
Look at your bank account, now sit your ass down
Look in your child's eyes, now sit your ass down
Look at your record deal, now sit your ass down
Cause you're really starting to look like a motherfucking clown
Want us to think that your big killa killa
But you rich now, plus you soft as a pillow
Leave that real shit for the niggas in the street
Cause you just raw meat, and we just ready to eat
I'll slap you with this barrel to see how you feel
Cause you have no idea on what's really real

[Hook]

[Bridge]
What's really real?

[Verse 3]
I harras cats get baby niggas cradle capped
Suckas get back slapped, this is the real rap
You's a pathetic cat, tryna wear your man's cap
You ain't never seen or heard the sounds of a gun clap
You's a coward with a pen, hide behind your song
You's a bitch with baggy jeans, hide behind your thong
You's gay without the Marvin, let's get it on
Pull back to squeeze, nigga you're gone
And I hope your man still hold you down like Alchemist
But I know he won't, cause you straight up bitch
Preem is real, Shug is real, the music's real
Look at your man, now tell me, that nigga's real?

[Hook x2]

[Outro]
Yeah what's really real?
Big Shug
I'm out baby
