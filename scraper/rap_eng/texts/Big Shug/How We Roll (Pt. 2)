[Verse 1: Big Shug]
What how you floss when you're boss
Every time I see your a** I wanna rip your chains off
But I don't
I know your type; snitch to the bone
Wanna see helicopters flying over my home
Wanna tap all my rooms and all of my phones
So you hear me and wifey sex at home
Y'all ain't got nothing to do that's why you roll in packs
If we go toe to toe you'll get that face cracked
1, 2, 3 it's a wrap
And I know you and your squad don't want no parts of that
Some mess up
Aaron Hernandez
I'm Boston hood
Happy Marquette Fernandez
I'm from Murdapan, y'all know the rest
In my hood I'm legend, plus the best
And what I speak is true, holy grail
I'm tryna keep my older son clean and outta jail, that's real

[Chorus: Big Shug]

F**k Y'all
I'm Saying

F**k Y'all
I'm Saying

F**k Y'all
I'm Saying

F**k Y'all
I'm Saying

F**k Y'all
I'm Saying

F**k Y'all
I'm Saying

F**k Y'all
I'm Saying

F**k Y'all
I'm Saying

[Verse 2: Chuxx]
Haters tryna knock me off the track that I tread
Nowadays you need some eyes 'pon the back of your head
Even the ones close to you, wanna see you drop
Close friends turn to foes, when you get to the top
So i stay on point like knife tips
Keep my game tighter that vice grip
And my name outta your loos lips
I switch gears, stick shift
With a clean flow in this dirty game
Seems like the whole city knows my name
I stay down like how it was in the H-town
Riding Greyhounds
Till I came up
Like a raised flag
These haters hoping my grind lag
While they put in work in the crime lab
I'm steady hiking the bar tab
For me and my crew
I ain't worried bout nothing
Always got my back
Till we close the curtain
From Murdapan to TO
We chop it up like Preemo
You don't want us elevating
But you'll never hear us saying

[Chorus]

[Big Shug]
F**k Y'all

[Chuxx]
We keep it real 'cos that's how we roll

[Big Shug]
F**k Y'all

[Chuxx]
We hold it down 'cos that's all we know

[Big Shug]
F**k Y'all

[Chuxx]
Yeah we never have to play the role

[Big Shug]
F**k Y'all

[Chuxx]
Masta Ace, we were born to roll

[Big Shug]
F**k Y'all

[Chuxx]
We keep it real 'cos that's how we roll

[Big Shug]
F**k Y'all

[Chuxx]
We hold it down 'cos that's all we know

[Big Shug]
F**k Y'all

[Chuxx]
Yeah we never have to play the role

[Big Shug]
F**k Y'all

[Chuxx]
Masta Ace, we were born to roll
