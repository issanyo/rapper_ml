[Verse 1]
Expectations (expectations)
Can make you believe (can make you believe)
That what you desire (what you desire)
Is what you need

[Pre-Chorus 1]
And I'm thinking
What if we just stop livin' in the moment?
And I'm thinking
And maybe we both will be way less disappointed

[Chorus]
From all these e-e-e-e-e-expectations
E-e-e-e-e-expectations
So many e-e-e-e-e-expectations
E-e-e-e-e-expectations, yeah

[Verse 2]
Expectations (expectations)
Babe, I know you don't mean (said I know you don't mean)
To make small situations (make small situations)
Bigger than they should be, than they should be

[Pre-Chorus 2]
And I'm thinking
What if we just stop living in the present?
And I'm thinking
And maybe we both will be way less disconnected

[Chorus]
From all these e-e-e-e-e-expectations
E-e-e-e-e-expectations
So many e-e-e-e-e-expectations
E-e-e-e-e-expectations

[Outro]
I cannot read your mind and I don't want to
I cannot read your mind and I don't want to
I cannot read your mind and I don't want to
I cannot read your mind and I don't want to
So many e-e-e-e-e-expectations
