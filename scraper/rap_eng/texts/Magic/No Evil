[Verse 1]
Woke up in the morning to another perfect stranger
Jumped into the shower to wash off the situation
I can't tell the difference if I'm crying or it's raining
Either way I know that there is something in the changes

[Pre-Hook]
And all I could think of is you in that sundress
And if there's a chance to be with you I promise

[Hook]
That I will speak no evil
And I will see no darkness
And I will only only hear your voice
'Til the demons go back to where they belong
(Speak no, see no, hear no evil)
'Til the demons go back to where they belong
(Speak no, see no, hear no evil)

[Verse 2]
Can you take me somewhere where the devil cannot find us
Rid me of the poison that has only paralyzed us
I don't want to waste another moment here without love
And I hope there's still a space in your heart for me

[Pre-Hook]
And all I could think of is you in that sundress
And if there's a chance to be with you I promise
[Hook]
That I will speak no evil
And I will see no darkness
And I will only only hear your voice
'Til the demons go back to where they belong
(Speak no, see no, hear no evil)
'Til the demons go back to where they belong
(Speak no, see no, hear no evil)

(oh,oh, no evil)
(oh,oh, no evil)
(oh,oh, no evil)

[Pre-Hook]
And all I could think of is you in that sundress
And if there's a chance to be with you I promise
[Hook]
That I will speak no evil
And I will see no darkness
And I will only only hear your voice
'Til the demons go back to where they belong
(Speak no, see no, hear no evil)
'Til the demons go back to where they belong
(Speak no, see no, hear no evil)

[Outro]
Oh, put on your sundress and meet me in the sunshine
Oh, put on the sundress and meet me in the sunlight
(Speak no, see no, hear no evil)
No evil, woah
(Speak no, see no, hear no evil)
