They said change your name in Hollywood
Say, hide your head since they may think you're no good
But I ain't ever changing what my mama gave me
I'm gonna live my life the way God made me

Said the way God made me
Yes, the way God me
The way God me, the way God me
Said the way God made me
Yes, the way God me
The way God me, the way God me

They say you don't look like what we want
Do you want me to dye my hair platinum blonde
But I ain't ever gonna change what my mama gave me
I'm gonna live my life the way God made me

Said the way God made me
Yes, the way God me
The way God me, the way God me
Said the way God made me
Yes, the way God me
The way God me, the way God me

So I will not throw away traditions
'Cause you lack in cultural visions
I'm living my destiny the way God made me
And I will not judge you 'cause you're different
So my children see no difference
This is our chance, chance to be free

Said the way God made me
Yes, the way God me
The way God me, the way God me
Said the way God made me
Yes, the way God me
The way God me, the way God me

The way, said the way
Yes, the way God me, the way God me
Yes, the way God me, that's the way God me
Yes, the way God me
Yes, the way God me
The way God me, the way God me
Yes, the way God me
