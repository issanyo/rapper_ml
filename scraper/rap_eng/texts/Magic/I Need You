[Verse 1]
I think it's time to come home
Been in this desert too long
Thought I could make it without it
But now I forever know that I need you

[Chorus]
I need you, I need you
I need you like my last drop of water
I need you, I need you, I need you, oh

[Verse 2]
I cannot change who I am
And I might mess this up again
But I'll live in vain here without you
My heart is taking a stand cause I need you

[Chorus]
I need you, I need you
I need you like my last drop of water
I need you, I need you, I need you, oh

[Chorus]
I need you, I need you
I need you like my last drop of water
Said I need you, said I need you, I need you
Come on, said I need you, I need you

[Outro
I'm coming home, I'm coming home today
I'm coming home
