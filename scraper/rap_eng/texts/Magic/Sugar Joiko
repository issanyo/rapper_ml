What's this controlling
This spell has got my body in a bind
I'm smitten by the sorcery
(Mmmmm)

(Aaah)
What's this spell controlling me
Illusions got my body in a bind
I'm smitten by the sorcery
(Ooooo)

I can feel my face turning red
But my body feels no harm
I'm imprisoned by the rune on my bed
(Mmmmm)

Chorus:

There's a fire that you can't describe
You bite your lips and roll your eyes
It's magic, m m m m magic

Conjuration calling through your thighs
You bo Before you realize
It's magic, m m m m magic

Verse 2:
It's too late for me now
I'm  so warm I can barely breathe
I surrender

Exhaltation, rapture of life
Fascination, claim your delight
It only consumes you, the harder you fight
You're running out of time

Chorus:

There's a fire that you can't describe
You bite your lips and roll your eyes
It's magic, m m m m magic

Conjuration calling through your thighs
You bo Before you realize
It's magic, m m m m magic
