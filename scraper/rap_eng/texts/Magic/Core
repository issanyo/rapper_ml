[Verse 1]
And I know we said, one more fight and we separate
And I know we said, can't keep living our lives this way
And I know we made ten-thousand other real promises
But what we said, it's easier said than done

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I don't wanna give up any more
Even though you're standing at the door
I'm saving numbers, never know for sure
Darling, I just feel it, feel it

[Chorus]
I feel it in my core
My core, my core
Just like I did before, before
In my core
Don't give up now

[Post-Chorus]
I feel it in my core, my core
My core, my core

[Verse 2]
And I know they say, never let go the past ol' pain
And I know they say, life is a little too short to waste
And I know I say, I don't give a damn about what they say
'Cause luck can change even the brightest smiles

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I don't wanna give up any more
Even though you're standing at the door
I'm saving numbers, never know for sure
Darling, I just feel it, feel it

[Chorus]
I feel it in my core
My core, my core
Just like I did before, before
In my core
Don't give up now

[Post-Chorus]
Said I feel it in my core, my core
My core, my core (don't you feel it in your core?)
My core, my core (don't you feel it in your core?)

[Outro]
And I know we said, one more fight and we separate
And I know we said, can't keep living our lives in pain
But you want to take that first step out the door
I hope you feel the same way as me in your core
Your core
