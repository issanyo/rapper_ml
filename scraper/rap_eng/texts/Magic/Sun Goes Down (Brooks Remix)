[Intro: Sonny Wilson]
Gonna break it, break it, break it, break it down for you, once more

[Chorus: Sonny Wilson]
All that I want
Is just to be crazy when the sun goes down
And all that I need
Is for you to be my baby when the sun goes down
All that I want
Is just to be crazy when the sun goes down
And all that I need
Is for you to be my baby when the sun goes down

[Pre-Drop: Sonny Wilson]
Sun goes down

[Drop: Brooks]
