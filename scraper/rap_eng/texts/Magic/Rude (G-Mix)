[JXXIII] Intro:
I know I ain't perfect and I never try to be
I got a father in heaven
And niggas that would die for me
Prioritize my priorities pridefully
They look me in the eye
But in they hearts
They sizing me
Sizing me ..UP!
Tailor made alterations
Starting shit for nothing...
Fabricated altercations
See I'm about peace
Why you wanna go to war
Was born with a pair a wings
Now it my time to soar

[JXXIII] Verse 1:
I'm a turn up the hardest
I'm a do me regardless
I'm a live life in college
Lets nail it no polish
Or acrylic
These lyrics
You feel it..in ya spirit
And in ya soul
J23, Bryan Rivera, lets go!!

Why you gotta be so rude
Life's too short to have an attitude
You cross em on the court, now they mad at you
You make it to the top, now they mad that's you
You take another shot of that blue Bombay Sapphire (ooooh)
Kanye? that's fire, dude!
Ayo you heard that new? New new..

[Bryan Rivera] Hook:
Why you gotta be so rude
Don't you know I'm human too?
Why you gotta be so rude?
Im a turn it up anyway

Live yo life
Crank it up everyday
Live yo life
No matter what they say
Live yo life
Be with yo family
Why you gotta be so...
RUDE...

[JXXIII] Verse 2:
Clean up yo act
They out there getting money
You right here talking smack
Walls against the back
Or Back against the WALL
If u trip and fall break and then u
Crawl
What a Horrible sight
Time to change yo insight
1000 parties out there and u do no Get invite
Put positive in yo life
A lil Passion in heart
Love in yo soul
I know Its been there from the start
Well bae here's a restart
Brand new perspective
Cross it off ya bucket list
Gone head check it (let's check it)

[Bryan Rivera] Bridge:
I'm a turn up for the rest of my life
No flex no flex
I already know
You can say whatever you like...
But you won't be happy if you don't let go!
