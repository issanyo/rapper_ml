[Verse 1]
I know a girl
Halfway around the world
She's been feeling lost and alone
No place to call her own
All she ever wanted was peace
Caught in a family
Tell me how we got so cold
Only heaven knows

[Pre-Chorus]
If I could sail above the ocean
On a spaceship made of faith
Up on a two way trip to heaven
To rearrange our destiny

[Chorus]
You know I would I would I would I would I would
You know I would I would I would I would I would, hey
You know I would I would I would I would I would
You know I would I would I would I would I would

[Verse 2]
I know a boy
Lost all of the joy
Living in the shadows of fear
With the devil in his ear
All he ever wanted was peace
Caught in a family
Tell me how we got so cold
Only heaven knows

[Pre-Chorus]
If I could sail above the ocean
On a spaceship made of faith
Up on a two way trip to heaven
To rearrange our destiny

[Chorus]
You know I would I would I would I would I would
You know I would I would I would I would I would, hey
You know I would I would I would I would I would
You know I would I would I would I would I would

[Bridge]
If I could sail above the ocean
On a spaceship made of faith
Up on a two way trip to heaven
To rearrange our destiny
Oh, if I could jump in the DeLorean
And go back to yesterday
You know I'll change how the story ends
And you'll be right here next to me

[Chorus]
You know I would I would I would I would I would
You know I would I would I would I would I would
You know I would I would I would I would I would
You know I would I would I would I would I would
You know I would I would I would I would I would
You know I would I would I would I would I would
You know I would I would I would I would I would
You know I would I would I would I would I would
You know I would
