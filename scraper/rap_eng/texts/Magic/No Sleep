[Chorus]
I get no sleep, I get no sleep
I get no sleep, I'm wide awake
I get no sleep, I get no sleep
I get no sleep, I'm wide awake

[Verse 1]
It's four o'clock in the morning
I can't sleep cause the dog keeps snoring
And then the baby starts crying
Waking up my girl, she's trying to get a couple hours in
Before we gotta make them breakfast
Then rush to the school again, every damn day

[Chorus]
And I get no sleep, I get no sleep
I get no sleep, I'm wide awake
I get no sleep, I get no sleep
I get no sleep, I'm wide awake

[Verse 2]
Two kids and a mortgage
We had to put our old life in storage
Our single friends don't call us
Cause we'd rather grab drinks at Starbucks

[Verse 3]
We go to the zoo a lot
We've watched every Disney movie
We love everything we got
But I swear these days

[Pre-Chorus]
That all I wanna do is lie in bed with you

[Chorus]
But no, I get no sleep, I get no sleep
I get no sleep, I'm wide awake
I get no sleep, I get no sleep
I get no sleep, I'm wide awake
I said I get no sleep

[Chorus]
I get no sleep, I get no sleep
I get no sleep, I'm wide awake
I get no sleep, I get no sleep
I get no sleep, I'm wide awake
