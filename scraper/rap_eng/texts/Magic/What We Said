[Refrain: Shakira]
I'm leaving with a broken heart
I never meant to do you harm
Don't ever wanna see you cry, again
And everybody hurts sometimes
I never meant to do you wrong
I know you're gonna be just fine, he said

[Verse 1: Shakira]
I wish we could go back in time
See the world with different eyes
Knowing what we both know now
Could've made it work somehow

[Hook: Shakira & MAGIC!]
What we said, what we say
What we made we can't unmake
What we give is what we get
And this is what we're stuck with now
But we said, whatever that we said
What we made you know we can't unmake
What we give is only what we get
And this is what we're stuck with now

[Refrain: Shakira]
I'm leaving with a broken heart
I never meant to do you harm
Don't ever wanna see you cry, again
But everybody hurts sometimes
I never meant to do you wrong
I know you're gonna be just fine, he said

[Verse 2: MAGIC!]
I wish we could go back in time
Find a road that doesnâ€™t wind
Right now darling we would be
Beautiful like harmony

[Hook: Shakira & MAGIC!]
What we said, what we say
What we made, we can't unmake
What we give is what we get
And this is what we're stuck with now
But we said whatever that we said
What we made you know we can't unmake
What we get is only what we gave
And this is what we're stuck with now

[Refrain: Shakira]
I'm leaving with a broken heart
I never meant to do you harm
Don't ever wanna see you cry, again
But everybody hurts sometimes
I never meant to do you wrong
I know you're gonna be just fine, he said

[Bridge: Shakira & MAGIC!]
Do you remember how you used to get lost in my eyes?
(I remember, darling)
Do you remember how you promised you'd never say goodbye?
I remember, I remember, I remember

[Hook: Shakira, MAGIC! & both]
But we said and what we said
What we made we can't unmake
What we give is only what we get
And this is what we're stuck with now

[Refrain: Shakira]
I'm leaving with a broken heart
I never meant to do you harm
Don't ever wanna see you cry, again
But everybody hurts sometimes
I never meant to do you wrong
I know you're gonna be just fine, he said
Again
