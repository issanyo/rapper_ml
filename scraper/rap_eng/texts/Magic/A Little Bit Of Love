[Verse 1]
Come on, come on, this isn't right
This ain't the way you live a life
This ain't the way you sacrifice
Come on, come on
Hold on, hold on but don't forget
These [?] you got across the chest
And darkness and light [?]
We'd hold on, hold on (it's not over yet)

[Pre-Chorus]
With a little bit of love, we can heal the pain and mend the distance
With a little bit of love, we can breathe again
With a little bit of love, we can fill the emptiness in our hearts
With a little bit of love, we could feel again

[Chorus]
With a little bit of love
With a little bit of love
With a little bit of love
With a little bit of love

[Verse 2]
Come on, come on, it's not too late
This ain't the time to separate
This is a chance to elevate
Come on, come on
Hold on, hold on and don't you go
I don't believe we've lost it all
There is a chance to get back home
Hold on, hold on ('cause you're not alone)

[Pre-Chorus]
With a little bit of love, we can heal the pain and mend the distance
With a little bit of love, we can breathe again
With a little bit of love, we can fill the emptiness in our hearts
With a little bit of love, we could feel again

[Chorus]
With a little bit of love
With a little bit of love
With a little bit of love
With a little bit of love

[Bridge]
You and me, don't you know we can be
Better than this (so much better than this)
Darling, you and me, don't you know we can be
Happier than this
You and me, don't you know we can be
Better than this (so much better than this)
You and me, don't you know we can be
Happier than this

[Chorus]
With a little bit of love
With a little bit of love
With a little bit of love
With a little bit of love
