[Verse 1: Nasri Atweh]
I thought I met the one
She had everything I wanted
A beauty in the sun
And we like the same bands

[Pre-Chorus: Nasri Atweh]
We danced, we laughed, we took a couple things
We screamed, we clapped, like kids in the rain
The time we had was something from a dream
'Til reality kicked in

[Chorus: Nasri Atweh]
And she said, she said she'd run away with me
So I took her to the VIP
And when the lights went on, she was gone forever
Never trust a girl at Coachella
She said she was the one for me
She was kissing me from cheek to cheek
But when the lights went on, she was gone forever
Never trust a girl at Coachella

[Verse 2: Nasri Atweh]
I met another one
Standing in a sundress
She was innocent at first
Introduced me to her girlfriends

[Pre-Chorus: Nasri Atweh]
We danced, we laughed, with water in our hands
We screamed, we clapped, like kids in the sand
She restored my faith in the human race
'Til reality kicked in
And she said

[Chorus: Nasri Atweh]
She said she'd run away with me
So I took her to the VIP
And when the lights went on, she was gone forever
Never trust a girl at Coachella
She said she was the one for me
She was kissing me from cheek to cheek
But when the lights went on, she was gone forever
She was gone, gone, gone, gone
Never trust a girl at Coachella

[Verse 3: D.R.A.M.]
I'm still trippin' off a devious plan
I was trippin' off the shrooms
She was trippin' for a band
She took notice of some fans
And stopped for pics, 'cause I'm the man
She jumped over on my dick
'Cause she just realized who I am
Got her past the gate, actin' like my date
Soon as she got in, started actin' fake
She ain't wanna stay close to me
Even though she was just blowin' me
Blowin' in the wind, bus to bus
Member to member, all for lust
Lead singer to the man on the drums
Slow in her waist but as fast as they come

[Chorus: Nasri Atweh]
She said she'd run away with me
So I took her to the VIP
And when the lights went on, she was gone forever
Never trust a girl at Coachella
She said she was the one for me
She was kissing me from cheek to cheek
But when the lights went on, she was gone forever
Never trust a girl at Coachella

[Outro: Nasri Atweh]
She was gone
Run away with me
She was gone
VIP
Lights went on, she was gone forever
Never trust a girl at Coachella
Never trust a girl at Coachella
