[Verse 1]
Your fuchsia’s confusion
Your teal is unclear
Your aqua’s a hard one
To read, yes I feel
You’re painting the future
So far from the past
Can we get back to basics
To make this thing last

[Chorus]
Back to the primary colors
So we can blend together again
Back to the primary colors
A little blue, yellow and red
Back to the primary colors
So we can blend together again
Back to the primary colors
A little blue, yellow and red

[Verse 2]
Your violet is silent
Your beige is a maze
Your canary is scary
So much I can’t take
Creative evolution
You’re moving too fast
Can we count a little one, two, three
To make this thing last

[Chorus]
Back to the primary colors
So we can blend together again
Back to the primary colors
A little blue, yellow and red
Back to the primary colors
Back to the primary colors
Don’t want to confuse you
You know that I choose you
But before I lose you
Can we go back
Back to the primary colors
So we can blend together again
Back to the primary colors
A little blue, yellow and red

[Bridge]
Red, red, red, red, red, red, red
Blue, yellow and red
Red, red, red, red, red, red, red
Blue, yellow and red
Red, red, red, red, red, red, red
Blue, yellow and red
Red, red, red, red, red, red, red
Back to the primary colors
Back to the primary colors
The one;s that confuse you
Enough that I choose you
Before I lose you
Please come back

[Chorus]
Back to the primary colors
So we can blend together again
Back to the primary colors
A little blue, yellow and red
Back to the primary colors
Back to the primary colors
Don’t want to confuse you
You know that I choose you
But before I lose you
Can we go back
Back to the primary colors
So we can blend together again
Back to the primary colors
A little blue, yellow and red
