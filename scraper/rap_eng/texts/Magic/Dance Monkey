[Verse 1]
I was in the wild
Living life from tree to tree
So I learned a simple song
And sang it in a jamboree

[Verse 2]
And the people came and cheered
Thought that I was finally free
Till they sold me to a man
That had another plan for me

[Chorus]
He said dance monkey, dance
(Dance monkey)
Play that song I know, oh, oh
He said dance monkey, dance
(Dance monkey)
In this yellow coat

[Post-Chorus]
Dance, dance, dance monkey
Dance, dance, dance monkey
Dance, dance, dance monkey

[Verse 3]
Saved up just enough
Enough to buy a new guitar
And I wrote a simple song
An honest message from my hear

[Verse 4]
When I sang it to the crowd
It was not the same applause
I could hear them screaming out
You know what we came here for

[Chorus]
They said dance monkey, dance
(Dance monkey)
Play that song I know, oh, oh
They said dance monkey, dance
(Dance monkey)
In your flower coat

[Post-Chorus]
Dance, dance, dance monkey
Dance, dance, dance monkey

[Outro]
It doesn't matter what the people say
You can take my house way
Cause I know that I'll never be no
Dance, dance, dance monkey
It doesn't matter what the people say
You can take my house way
Cause I know that I'll never be no
Dance, dance, dance monkey
