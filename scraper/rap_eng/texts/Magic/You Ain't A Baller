(Magic & Master P)
I'm just saying brah
Can you palm the ball (Like this)
But can you shoot the ball (All day)
But can you dunk the ball (Like this)
Basketball (That's good enough?) Ha ha ha ha

(Magic)
Where the ballers at huh huh
Where the ballers at huh huh
Y'all where the ballers at
Let's get ready to rumbbbbble!
Cal, I want you to escort all the imposters off the floor

(Hook: Magic)
I'll be done shot a three-pointer Whoosh!
I done been slam dunked on ya
You did a lot better on the corner
Cause I can tell by your game, you ain't a baller uh
I done be shot the three-pointer (Whoosh!)
I done been slam dunked on ya
You did a lot better on the corner
Cause I can tell by your game you ain't a baller uh

(Magic}
Well it's the first of the month and I just got paid
So I'm trying to go home and catch a game on cable
Something about the NBA keeps me watching
Everytime I see em' play I'm hypnotized
All that slam dunking, oops left em' in they shoes
All night, got you feeling like you was born to lose
It's going down, somebody going to be high tonight
Dennis Rodman might fight tonight
Somebody getting slammed on, so stop complaining
Play the game like a man boy
Is you mad cause you got, juke juked
Somebody left you stuck in suspense
Broke your confidence, got you looking for the bench
While the world is watching you
Alright moms, I had a bad game got dunked on about four times
Better luck tomorrow
But to beat this squad, you gots to be a baller, what

Who remembers Mo Cheeks, David Johnson
Elvin Hayes and Bill Walton
Ball handling from the Earl the Pearl
And the three-point shots from Larry Bird
Check out passes passed from Pistol Pete
And the way Dr. J made everything look so sweet
What about the tower called Wilt Chamberlain
And Kareem, got us in the game again
Bill Russell, won eleven NBA championships
Walt Frazier, he could be better known as a pimp
Elgin Baylor, made shooting three-pointers look easy
Magic Johnson, in my opinion there was no better leading
Michael Jordan, he's amazing how does he jump so far
No matches perfect, so I think he might be from the planet Mars
And to you upcoming stars, you know who you are
Feel blessed and thank the Lord that you's a baller

(Hook x2)

Where the ballers at huh huh

Where the ballers at huh huh
Where the ballers at what what
Where the ballers at huh huh
Where the ballers at what what
Where the ballers at huh huh
Where the baller at whatttttt!
