[Verse 1]
The things you say
Could help me re-think every choice I ever made
Turn my sunshine into dark and gloomy days
But just to turn a phrase, oh no, yeah

[Chorus 1]
The things you say
Could take my broken, shattered, lonely melody
And turn them into perfect dances, symphonies
Shooting like the stars in the night sky
Beautiful like heaven in daylight
You got me hanging on to your every word
So be careful with the things you say

[Verse 2]
The things you say
Could have me questioning my own reality
Turn my glory into jealousy and rage
Oh the power of the things you say

[Chorus 2]
The things you say
Could take the sky to tired weakest parts of me
And turn 'em into [?] I never [?]
Breaking through the limits of my pride
Sever me for reasons to not try
Got me hanging onto your every word
So be careful with the things you say

[Bridge]
Everywhere, everywhere
You say, you say
Everywhere, everywhere
You say, you say, you say

[Verse 3]
The things you say
Can make me love you in the most amazing ways
Or fill my heart with only loneliness and pain
'Cause I listen to the things you say
