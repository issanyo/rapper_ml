Agora é a nossa hora
É mano, Brazil!
There's a lot going on in the world today
(Hey-ey)
People moving so fast like an airplane
(Hey-ey-ey)
Madness in the air trying to chase the sun
(Hey-ey)

I was thinking for tonight we can take you to the stars
It doesn't matter where you're from
It's all for one dream
You never be the same
Once you become a champion

So hey-ey, hey-ey
This is our time
Agora é a nossa hora
Hey-ey, hey-ey
This is our time
Agora é a nossa hora

Surround yourself with the ones you love
(Hey-ey come together)
Hands up in the air to the sky above
(Hey-ey, no matter the weather)
No stress no pain in your heart tonight
(Hey-ey)
Let the strength inside you multiply
(Don't you know, don't you know)

It doesn't matter where you're from
It's all for one dream
You'll never be the same
Once you become a champion

So hey-ey, hey-ey
This is our time
Agora é a nossa hora
Hey-ey, hey-ey
This is our time
Agora é a nossa hora

Can you feel it? (Whoa)
Can you feel it hey-ey? (Whoa)
Can you feel it? (Agora é a nossa hora)
Can you feel it? (Whoa)
Can you feel it hey-ey? (Whoa)
Can you feel it? (Agora é a nossa hora)

So hey-ey, hey-ey
This is our time
Agora é a nossa hora
Hey-ey, hey-ey
This is our time
Agora é a nossa hora

Saúde to my beautiful people
Let us all unite
Under one light, one light, Brazil!
