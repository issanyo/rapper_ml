[Intro: Nasri]
(Hey!, come on up)

[Verse 1: Nasri]
Another manic Monday, praying for the week to go by
While Jimmy's at the golf course, smoking on a Cuban Delight

[Pre-Chorus: Nasri]
Now money, money, we all got to make it, yeah
But right now, I could use a vacation

[Chorus: Nasri]
I wish it was Sunday, Sunday funday
A Monday-to-Monday Sunday funday
I wish it was Sunday, Sunday funday
A Monday-to-Monday Sunday funday
Sunday funday

[Verse 2: Nasri]
Another torture Tuesday; I cannot seem to open my eyes
While Suzie's at the dayspa getting ready for Jimmy tonight

[Pre-Chorus: Nasri]
Now money, money, we all got to make it, yeah
But right now, I just need a vacation

[Chorus: Nasri]
I wish it was Sunday, Sunday funday
A Monday-to-Monday Sunday funday
I wish it was Sunday, Sunday funday
A Monday-to-Monday Sunday funday
Sunday funday


[Bridge: Nasri]
(Ooooh, Ooooh, Ooooh)
We don't wanna work no more
(Ooooh, Ooooh, Ooooh)
Life is just too short

[Pre-Chorus: Nasri]
Now money, money, we all got to make it, yeah
But everyday  should be a vacation

[Chorus: Nasri]
I wish it was Sunday, Sunday funday
A Monday-to-Monday Sunday funday
I wish it was Sunday, Sunday funday
A Monday-to-Monday Sunday funday
Sunday funday
(Ooooh, Ooooh, Ooooh, sunday funday, ah yeah)

[Outro: Nasri]
We don't wanna work no more (sunday funday)
Life is just too short (sunday funday)
