I know you're coming from another generation. (What?)
Cause you can see no demons in my conversation. (What?)
It's on me that I lack communication. (Whoa, oh oh oh)
I cannot offer you a diamond or a mortgage. (What?)
All I wanted was a home-cooked sandwich (What?)
But your greedy little fingers couldn't manage (No, oh oh oh)

Long live the queen of all exaggeration, long live the queen
Cause you're just a little girl in a big, big, big, big world
Let it do, let it do, let it do, do
You're just a little girl in a big, big, big, big world
Let it do, let it do, let it do, do
Let it do, let it do, let it do, do

You're sleeping every day for twenty-seven hours (What?)
Get a real job, baby take a shower (Whoa)
(Whoa, oh oh oh)
Parking ticket on your car is not an issue (What?)
Why you screaming on the corner like they hit you? (What?)
Sweetheart, don't you know I'm trying to fix you? (Whoa, oh oh oh)

Long live the queen of all exaggeration, long live the queen
Cause you're just a little girl in a big, big, big, big world
Let it do, let it do, let it do, do
You're just a little girl in a big, big, big, big world
Let it do, let it do, let it do, do
Let it do, let it do, let it do, do

If I was your father I would lock you up inside of your room
Until you figure out exactly how to think of someone but you
If I was your father I would spank you 'til you know what you did
Let it do, let it do
Let it do, let it do, let it do, let it do do
Long live the queen of all exaggeration, long live the queen
Cause you're just a little girl in a big, big, big, big world
Let it do, let it do, let it do, do
You're just a little girl in a big, big, big, big world
Let it do, let it do, let it do, do
Let it do, let it do, let it do, do
Let it do, let it do, let it do, do
Let it do, let it do, let it do, do
