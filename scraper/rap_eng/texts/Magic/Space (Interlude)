[Verse]
Space is keeping us together
Space is making bad things better
There's a time and all on us, pleasure
And we can make it last
Make it last forever

[Chorus]
We're just in our space
We're just in our space
We're just in our space
We're just in our space
We're just in our space
We're just in our space
Ohhh, ohhh
