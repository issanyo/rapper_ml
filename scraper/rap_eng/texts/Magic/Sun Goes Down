[Intro: Sonny Wilson]
Gonna break it, break it, break it, break it down for you, once more

[Verse 1: MAGIC!]
When the sun goes down
And your eyes cannot see
When the sun goes down
And your hands cannot reach
When your bones feel like breaking
And your heart cannot take another run
I'll be there when the sun goes down

[Chorus: Sonny Wilson]
All that I want
Is just to be crazy when the sun goes down
And all that I need
Is for you to be my baby when the sun goes down

[Verse 2: MAGIC!]
When the sun goes down
We'll be dancing in the dark
When the sun goes down
To the beating of your heart
As the Earth moves in orbit
I will always be the one
Who stands my ground
I'll be there when the sun goes down

[Chorus: Sonny Wilson]
[All that I want
Is just to be crazy when the sun goes down
And all that I need
Is for you to be my baby when the sun goes down]

[Chorus: Sonny Wilson]
[All that I want
Is just to be crazy when the sun goes down
And all that I need
Is for you to be my baby when the sun goes down]

[Outro: MAGIC!]
When the sun goes down
When the sun goes down
When the sun goes down
I see you around
