[Verse 1: Shakira]
Why do you say things if you do not mean them?
Why do you fill up my wounds with your dirt?
Bullets are flying this time, I can't shield them
Santa Maria, I know how it hurts

[Chorus: Shakira & MAGIC!]
'Cause you cut me deep
Your words are like steel
And now I can't sleep
Cause I'll never heal

[Verse 2: Shakira & (MAGIC!)]
Why do you make me believe we are spirits?
Molded together to conquer this Earth (molded together)
Climb up the mountains so high we can see them (yeah)
Then send me to plummet with savaging words

[Chorus 2: Shakira & MAGIC!]
'Cause you cut me deep (you cut me deep, so deep, so deep)
Your words are like steel (now every word is sharp like steel)
And now I can't sleep
'Cause I'll never heal (you cut me, you cut me)

[Bridge: Shakira & MAGIC!, Both]
I am covered in scars
Like a rose without thorns
My defenses are gone
No one's out there to warn
If there's love in your heart
Let me leave now in peace
You know you took it too far

[Chorus: Shakira & MAGIC!]
Cause you cut me deep
Your words are like steel
And now I can't sleep
'Cause I'll never heal

[Outro: Shakira]
You cut me deep
You cut me so deep
You cut me deep
You cut me so deep
You cut me deep
You cut me so deep
You cut me deep
You cut me so, so
You cut me deep
You cut me so deep
You cut me deep
You cut me so, so, so, so
