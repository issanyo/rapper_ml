[Verse 1]
Every day, the same routine
Operating like machines
On and on we live this way
With no spontaneity

[Pre-Chorus]
What happened to the wild ones?
No sense of the hours
What happened to the freedom?
Can we get that back?

[Chorus]
So we're going, going through the motions
We're just going, going through the motions
We used to live like waves in the oceans
Now we're going, going through the motions

[Verse 2]
What if I said, "Let's run away"?
A one-way ticket to an exotic place
Dance and scream and shout in the pouring rain
Find serenity in the great escape

[Pre-Chorus]
What happened to the wild ones?
No sense of the hours
What happened to the freedom?
Can we get that back?

[Chorus]
'Cause we're going, going through the motions
We're just going, going through the motions
We used to live like waves in the oceans
Now we're going, going through the motions

[Bridge]
I can't keep going, I can't keep going
I can't keep going, I can't keep going
I can't keep going, I can't keep going
I can't keep going, I can't
I can't, I can't, I can't

[Chorus]
Said, I can't keep going, going through the motions
You can't keep going, going through the motions
We used to live life with so much emotion
Can't keep going, going through the motions
