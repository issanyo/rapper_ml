[Intro]
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh

[Verse 1]
See, we all need to be loved
A human needs to be loved
There's no gift I can buy
That could make you feel that kind of high
That lifts your heart
So we all want to feel special (special)
Truly, deeply special (special)
There's no words I can say
That will deeply, truly compensate
So here's where I'll start

[Chorus]
Just want you to know that I appreciate you
I don't always show it but I swear that it's true
See, I love the beautiful things I know that you do (you do)
Just want you to know that I appreciate you

[Verse 2]
I recognize your strength (I recognize your strength)
Your confidence style in place (your confidence style in place)
Oh darling, without you near (without you near)
I'd be a mess right now, it's clear, so clear, so clear

[Chorus]
Just want you to know that I appreciate you
I don't always show it but I swear that it's true
All of the beautiful things I know that you do (you do)
Said, I want you to know that I appreciate you

[Bridge]
Tomorrow, nobody knows
What may not come or go
Just in case we divide on this winding road
I need you to know

[Chorus]
Said, I need to know (that I appreciate you)
I don't always show it (but I swear that it's true)
All of the beautiful things I know that you do (you do)
Just want you to know that I appreciate you

[Post-Chorus]
Said I do, I do, I do (I do, I do, I do), oh-oh-oh
And I do, I do, I do (I do, I do, I do)
No matter where I'll go or what'll do (I do)
I will appreciate you

[Outro]
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh
