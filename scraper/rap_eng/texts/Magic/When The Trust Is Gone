[Chorus]
When the trust is gone (when the trust is gone)
So is the love (so is the love), so is the love (so is the love)
When the trust is gone, yeah (when the trust is gone)
Nothing's enough (nothing's enough), oh, nothing's enough

[Verse]
I really hate the way you look at me lately
It's like a stranger sitting right in my bed
You built an invisible wall that surrounds me
From every stupid little thing that I did

[Pre-Chorus]
And I know that you want to be
Closer to me, baby

[Chorus]
But when the trust is gone (when the trust is gone)
So is the love (so is the love), so is the love (so is the love)
When the trust is gone (when the trust is gone)
Oh, nothing's enough (nothing's enough), nothing's enough

[Pre-Chorus]
And I know that you want to be
Closer to me, baby

[Chorus]
But when the trust is gone (is gone, is gone)
Yeah, so is the love (is gone), so is the love
When the trust is gone (is gone, is gone)
Oh, nothing's enough (nothing's enough), nothing's enough

[Outro]
I really hate the way you look at me lately
Oh no, when the trust is gone
I really hate the way you look at me lately
Oh no, when the trust is gone
When the trust is gone
When the trust is gone
