I am a sinner, as cold as the winter
She is the sun, she is the queen of love
I am a burden, always uncertain
She is a raft, only believes in us

And I know that she cries by the red in her eyes
She's been waiting for signs that never come
All she ever really wanted was...

One woman, one man
That's all that she asks
No other demands
One woman, one man, yeah

I am a loser, I only confuse her
She is the sail, no matter where we go
Tradition innovates passed down
The way I live is for tonight
Oh I wish it wasn't so (Lord I wish it wasn't so)

I know that she cries by the red in her eyes
She's been waiting for signs that never come
All she ever really wanted was...

One woman, one man
That's all that she asks
No other demands
One woman, one man, yeah

One woman, one man
That's all that she asks

One woman, one man...
