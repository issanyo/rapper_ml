Hey baby, baby
Your heart's too big to be treated small
So please don't blame me, blame me
To try to be the one who could have it all
You know that it's stupid, stupid
Telling you it's dark when you see the light
And I know you ain't foolish, foolish
Just give me one chance I could treat you right
So I say
Will I ever be too far away when you feel alone (No way no)
Will I ever back down my sword to protect our home (No way no)
Will I ever spend a day not telling you you're beautiful (No way no)
No way no way no (no way no way no)
My sister, sister
Told me that love ever hits your eyes
I promise you'll miss her, miss her
The second that she walks right out your sight
So we should just do it (do it, do it)
'Cause I don't want to risk her being right
Let's not be be foolish
Don't you know that family never lies
I promise that
Will I ever be too far away when you feel alone (No way no)
Will I ever back down my sword to protect our home (No way no)
Will I ever spend a day not telling you you're beautiful (No way no)
No way no way no (no way no way no)
Hey lady, lady
Life's too short to be waiting alone
So let's not waste it, waste it
When we both know you're the one (Woah)
Will I ever be too far away when you feel alone (No way no)
Will I ever back down my sword to protect our home (No way no)
Will I ever spend a day not telling you you're beautiful (No way no)
No way no way no (no way no way no)
No way no way no (no way no way no)
No way no way no (no way no way no)
No way no way no (no way no way no)
No way no way no (no way no way no)
No way no way no (no way no way no)
No way no way no (no way no way no)
No way no way no (no way no way no)
No way no way no (no way no way no)
