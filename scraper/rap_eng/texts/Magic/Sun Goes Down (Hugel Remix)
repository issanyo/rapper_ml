[Intro]
Oh, oh crazy
Oh, oh crazy
Crazy

[Chorus: Sonny Wilson]
All that I want
Is just to be crazy when the sun goes down
And all that I need
Is for you to be my baby when the sun goes down

[Breakdown: Sonny Wilson]

[Verse: MAGIC!]
When the sun goes down
We'll be dancing in the dark
When the sun goes down
To the beating of your heart
As the Earth moves in orbit
I will always be the one
Who stands my ground
I'll be there when the sun goes down

[Chorus: Sonny Wilson]
All that I want
Is just to be crazy when the sun goes down
And all that I need
Is for you to be my baby when the sun goes down

[Breakdown: Sonny Wilson]

[Chorus: Sonny Wilson]
All that I want
Is just to be crazy when the sun goes down
And all that I need
Is for you to be my baby when the sun goes down
