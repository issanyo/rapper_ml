Once upon a time a lonely boy with vision (vision)
Heard about a little mermaid cast away (cast away)
Saw a little bitty fin and started swimming (swimming)
She disappeared with the sunlight once again (once again)

He prayed unto his father
As his lungs filled up with water

Oh won't you take me to your paradise? (I wanna go)
Can I come play with you under the tide? (I wanna go)
I want to swim inside your ocean eyes (I wanna go)
Oh won't you take me to your paradise? (I wanna go)

When he woke up on the dry-land he saw visions (visions)
Of the life with the mermaid cast away (what a life, what a life it would be)
Couldn't tell if it was love or just impatience (patience)
Headed back with the black sun hits the waves (hits the waves)

And there she was in color
And with all his strength he called her

Oh won't you take me to your paradise? (I wanna go)
Can I come play with you under the tide? (I wanna go)
I want to swim inside your ocean eyes (I wanna go)
Oh won't you take me to your paradise?

Please don't drift away
Please don't drift away
Please don't drift away
Please don't drift away
Please don't drift away
Please don't drift away

Oh won't you take me to your paradise? (I wanna go)
Can I come play with you under the tide? (I wanna go)
I want to swim inside your ocean eyes (I wanna go)
Oh won't you take me to your paradise?

Oh won't you take me to your paradise? (I wanna go)
I've got to be with you, I don't know why (I wanna go)
Oh won't you take me to your paradise? (I wanna go)
I've got to be with you, I've got to be with you
(I wanna go, I wanna go)
Paradise, paradise, paradise, paradise (I wanna go)
Paradise, paradise, paradise, paradise
Paradise, paradise, paradise, paradise
Paradise, paradise, paradise, paradise
