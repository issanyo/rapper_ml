[Verse 1]
There she goes, there she goes, there she goes
There's nothing better than my beautiful woman
Even though, even though, even though
It's not always Heaven, we still fly together

[Pre-Hook]
To me you are more than just skin and bones
You are elegance and freedom and everything I know
So come on and

[Hook]
Baby let your hair down, let me run my fingers through it
We can be ourselves now, go ahead be foolish
No one's on the clock now, lying in this simple moment
You don't gotta worry now, just let your hair down

[Verse 2]
Tell me when, tell me when, tell me when
I can steal a sweet kiss right from you
I'm diving in, I'm diving in, I'm diving in
The water's warm right here

[Pre-Hook] + [Hook]

[Instrumental Solo]

[Hook]

[Outro]
You don't have to worry, yeah, oh
Let your hair down, woah
It's only us here, only us here, only us here (x3)
