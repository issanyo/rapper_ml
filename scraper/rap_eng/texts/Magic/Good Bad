[Verse:]
I done had my share of hurt
Enough hurt to know
That the bad guy finishes first
I won’t call you names
And I won’t curse you out
But give me a chance
You’ll see what being bads about

[PreHook:]
I’m bad at rollin’ up
But I’m good at makin’ love
And I ain’t never been to jail
But you can break me out my shell
You’re first on my list
And your lips I want to kiss
I’m a real good dude
But I wanna be bad with you

[Chorus:]
If you want it good then I’ll be bad
It ain’t no goin’ back cuz good boys finish last
I’ll change babe (x2)

[Verse:]
So Baby how did you bring a thug outta me?
Lemme Show you the true definition of
B A D (B A D)
But I ain’t loading clips
I’m or shootin hittas down
No that’s a no no
But I am gonna be the one
Who’s turnin’ up his glow

[PreHook:]
Im bad at rollin’ up
But good at makin’ love
And I ain’t never been to jail
But you can break me out my shell
You’re first on my list
And you lips I want to kiss
I’m a real good dude
But I wanna be with you

[Chorus 4x]
