[Verse 1]
She says she loves another
Says she loves another man
Ooh, and she says she wants to see him
Says she wants to see him again
She says she looks at me with love
Every time if that's what you have
I said I know the one you're talking about
He's not coming back

[Chorus]
'Cause I will never be
How you remember me (how you remember me)
No, I will never be
How you remember me (how you remember me)
And you can only see
The man I have come to be (man I have come to be)
'Cause I'll never be
How you remember me (how you remember me)

[Verse 2]
I saw you from the mirror, staring at a photograph
Ooh, and something about that moment
Always seems to make you laugh
I know that I joke a little less than I did
It seems some days I left and I just cannot forget
We cannot move forward if you're stuck in the past
(Darling, come back)

[Chorus]
'Cause I will never be
How you remember me (how you remember me)
No, I will never be
How you remember me (how you remember me)
And you can only see
The man I have come to be (man I have come to be)
'Cause I will never be
How you remember me (how you remember me)

[Bridge]
And you can only see, and you can only see
What I've come to be
And you can only see, and you can only see
What I've come to be
On your heart, it isn't easy
And I'm sorry if you've been flirting or you've been sneezing
If I'm changing, then I'm changing for a reason
I need just your heart

[Outro]
And it's not what you expected
But at least my love for you is still protected
You're the only one that I have not rejected
But you'll never be the way you remember me
