[Verse 1]
I stare at you, sometimes at night
Wishing I could just press rewind
'Cause I just want more
I get confused, sometimes my skin
Can't tell where yours stops and mine begins
In anything, and I just want more

[Chorus]
More of your days
More of your nights
More of your wrongs
More of your rights
Whatever you got, I'll take two
I just want more, more of you
Ooh, more of you
Ooh

[Verse 2]
What is this hold you got on me?
Stronger force than gravity
'Cause I just want more
'Cause I could spend centuries beside you, behind you
Inside you, forever love
It's not enough, I just want more

[Chorus]
More of your days
More of your nights
More of your dark
More of your light
If you had a clone, I would love her too
I just want more, more of you
I just want more, more of you
Ooh, more of you
Ooh

[Bridge]
More of your days
More of your nights
More of your dark
More of your light
Whatever you got, darling give me two
I just want more, darling, more of you

[Chorus]
More of your laughs
More of your cries
More of that wisdom
That lives in your eyes
In my next life, I'll be looking for you
'Cause I just want more, more of you
Ooh, more of you
Ooh, more of you

[Outro]
Ooh
