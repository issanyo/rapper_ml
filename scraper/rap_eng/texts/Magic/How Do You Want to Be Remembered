How do you want to be remembered?
As a sinner or a saint, as a hero or a villain?
Think about the steps you take
How do you want to be remembered
When they're standing at your grave?
On your tombstone, what is written?
Think about the steps you take

Do I reach for love (do I reach for love) only when she says she's leaving? (only when she says goodbye)
Do I pray above (do I pray above) only when I feel I'm needing?
See I can't sleep at night, when my sheep turn into demons
There's no alibi when the jury knows your secret
So I ask myself...

Cause on the day when you face judgement
You better have your story straight (you better have your story straight)
Were you a good friend and a husband
To the wife that gives you love, love, love
You love, love, love, oh
