[Verse 1]
Hey baby, baby
Your heart's too big to be treated small
So please don't blame me, blame me
For trying to be the one who could have it all
And I know they've been stupid, stupid
Telling you it's dark when you see the light
And I know you ain't foolish, foolish
Just give me one chance, I could treat you right
So I say...

[Chorus]
Will I ever be too far away when you feel alone?
No way, no
Will I ever back down my sword to protect our home?
No way, no
Will I ever spend a day not telling you you're beautiful?
No way, no
No way, no way, no
No way, no way, no

[Verse 2]
My sister, sister told me that "If love ever hits your eye
I promise you'll miss her, miss her
The second that she walks right out of your sight"
So we should just do it
Cause I don't wanna risk her being right
Let's not be foolish
Don't you know that family never lies?
I promise that...

[Chorus]
Will I ever be too far away when you feel alone?
No way, no
Will I ever back down my sword to protect our home?
No way, no
Will I ever spend a day not telling you you're beautiful?
No way, no
No way, no way, no
No way, no way, no

[Bridge]
Hey lady, lady
Life's too short to be waiting long
So let's not waste it, waste it
When we both know you're the one

[Chorus]
Will I ever be too far away when you feel alone?
No way, no
Will I ever back down my sword to protect our home?
No way, no
Will I ever spend a day not telling you you're beautiful?
No way, no
No way, no way, no
No way, no way, no

[Outro]
No way, no way, no
No way, no way, no
No way, no way, no
No way, no way, no
No way, no way, no
No way, no way, no
No way, no way, no
No way, no way, no
No way, no way, no
No way, no way, no
No way, no way, no
No way, no way, no
No way, no way, no
No way, no way, no
No way, no way, no
No way, no way, no
No way, no way, no
No way, no way, no
No way, no way, no
No way, no way, no
No way, no way, no
No way, no way, no
No way, no way, no
No way, no way, no
No way, no way, no
No way, no way, no
No way, no way, no
No way, no way, no
No way, no way, no
No way, no way, no
No way, no way, no
No way, no way, no
