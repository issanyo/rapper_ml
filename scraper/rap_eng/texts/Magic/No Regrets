[Chorus]
The world isn't over yet
We've still got a chance to place our bets
We both made a little mess
Nothing our two hearts can't put back
I'll never love you less
Don't let your worries second guess
Let's start over fresh, living a life with no regrets
Living a life with no regrets

[Verse 1]
I've got my issues, I admit that
You got some things that hold you back
But we are acting like we're children
Looking to blame for what we lack

[Pre-Chorus]
Before we lose everything we have tomorrow
Can we forget what went wrong yesterday

[Chorus]
The world isn't over yet
We've still got a chance to place our bets
We both made a little mess
Nothing our two hearts can't put back
I'll never love you less
Don't let your worries second guess
Let's start over fresh, living a life with no regrets
Living a life with no regrets

[Verse 2]
I know you're driving yourself crazy
Thinking that time has passed you by
And you're not close to where you said you'd be
But tell me, who is in this life?

[Pre-Chorus]
Before we lose everything we have tomorrow
Can we forget what went wrong yesterday?
So darling

[Chorus]
The world isn't over yet
We've still got a chance to place our bets
We both made a little mess
Nothing our two hearts can't put back
I'll never love you less
Don't let your worries second guess
Let's start over fresh, living a life with no regrets
Living a life with no regrets

[Outro]
The world isn't over
We could always start over
No weight on our shoulders
The world isn't over, darling
The world isn't over
We could always start over
No weight on our shoulders
The world isn't over, darling
