[Intro: Whitford]
"Yo, Sqid, you gotta answer your phone, dude. I'm staring those tickets right in the face. Alaska, Mt. McKinley, all of this is just happening so fast. Hey, listen, I know we're short on funds for this trip, so maybe we can ask Jody for some ice picks but, ugh, after this: Cuba, Pinar del Rio, who knows where else, dude. Senior year is gonna be crazy."

[Chorus 1: LayzSqid]
Mhm
A honey bear, a honey bee
I'm pouring out this life for me
I wanted you to gaze upon
Me running back from Babylon
I'm sailing up the Amazon
It's long

[Verse 1: LayzSqid]
I just took a hit of a shirt
I'm finding content on this Earth
Lay-Sqid put his roots in the dirt
Four years of high school
With Michael
First mates started and dang his flow is ice cool
Noticed the cycle of interfaith assemblies
Breaking all the rules to collect our crazy memories
In the back of Hunter's car like "Oh my gosh!
All these subwoofers will alert the cops!"
I need a moment of silence
(Why?)
Look me in my eye and told me, "LayzSqid was losing"
That's the biggest lie in my life I've been choosing
Where I wanna fly, and by fly, I been looting
I been looting

[Chorus 2: LayzSqid]
Yeah honey bear
Yeah honey bee
I'm pouring this life for me
I wanted you to gaze upon
Me running back from Babylon
I'm cruising up the Amazon
I'm searching for a fountain
Of youth

[Bridge 1: LayzSqid]
What's in store for me today
I saw a nice booty
I call that Don Quixote
I call her Don Quixote

[Verse 2: LayzSqid]
I wanna see the pyramids
I wanna take my kids
Give my children stories of all the trips we ever did
I hope they return
What they did learn
That life is a cycle
Like high school
Regardless of Bible
Freshman's the arrival
Man, your life is vital
Till you're final
Life's ongoing this ain't no recital

[Bridge 2: LayzSqid]
Down the Amazon
You might tag along
Got my sneakers on
Run to Babylon
(Aye yo Michael, what'd you say?)

[Outro: Whitford]
"You get in what you get out! Sqid's out here, a hundred percent, everyday, and it shows!"
