[Verse 1: Samson]
I see life as endless possibility
An endeavour defying futility
But there is nothing more frightening than sleeping each night thinking 'Did I do the right thing?' I should've got advice
But I can't escape my fear of letting people down
I wonder what Bradley would say if he could see me now
I pray that he's found peace in rest with Prince, Bowie, Heath, Queen and the best of the best
Is this the right path? I'm applied but will I fly to the heights or just plummet - declining in a mine shaft
I just want the things that I create to be lasting, and not just hit the breaks before my seatbelt's fastened
I turn on the TV just to free me for a minute from the things that I wish that I said, but I didn't
I can't build burned bridges, I can't sew loose stitches so I guess I have to live with the wrongs that I committed
Can't feel rejection stay out of harms way cos I keep everyone that I love at arms length
If I said this six months ago, things might not be the same
But it's too late and I hate that I burned out that flame

[Pre Chorus: Samson]
These the first world problems that people make up
Have a dream and then never wake up
When so much, turns to too much
Have a dream and then never wake up

[Chorus: Samson & Keats]
The day is on its way, it couldn't wait no more
Here it comes, here it comes
Ready or not, ready or not
The day is on its way, it couldn't wait no more
Here it comes, here it comes
Ready or not, here it comes

[Verse 2: Keats]
I know I don't know shit yet
Learn my lesson after every misstep
So when I lose it's like I've won
A rainy day with a glimmer of sun
Sometimes I wonder if I'm doing my best
At my max or a little bit less
Not much money, but I'm wealthy in sense, this kind of time on my hands won't happen ever again so like
How do I spend it?
Do I tend it? Do I lend it? Do I loose end weekend it? Full of split ends and shit trends, will my time be misspent? Temporary boyfriend intentions misread
On my laurels I'm sleeping in
Nah enough of that let's begin
Head down let's get down, next round - strive to be that kid with the god damn best sound

[Pre Chorus: Keats]
The first world problems that people make up
Have a dream and then never wake up
When so much, turns to too much
Have a dream and then never wake up

[Chorus: Keats & Samson]
The day is on its way, it couldn't wait no more
Here it comes, here it comes
Ready or not, ready or not
The day is on its way, it couldn't wait no more
Here it comes, here it comes
Ready or not, here it comes

[Verse 3: Samson]
When I get sad I look to the stars
They so pretty when you set em apart
I think we're close, but really we're far
But I know that'll be us cos this is only the start
I've got goals that could stretch out for miles
I wanna gain the respect of all of my idols
Make the EP to mixtapes and fight til'
All of my music's available on Tidal
I'm out here name dropping my way to fame
I'm stopping til' I'm played on Triple J I'm switching lanes
Quicker than you can say 'this shit is lame'
And I hate to say but I love to say, it's time to board this train
Before it becomes a bandwagon
Not a certainty but it can happen
Got most of ya wondering how is Sam rappin'
But here I am, tearing up this Chance track
Consistent persistence and now you listen this the Christian of the vision be a witness to this cataclysm
Rub my face in the dirt, say my issues don't matter
I'll keep fighting I'll keep pushing beat the glass until it shatters yo

[Pre Chorus: Samson]
First world problems that people make up
Keep on playing we gon' shake this shit up
Keep on telling us we making it up
Everyone's dream and may you never wake up

[Outro: Samson and Keats]
The day is on it's way it couldn't wait no more! Here it is
