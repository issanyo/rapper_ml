{Intro}
Tough Life

Yeah, c’mon let’s go
Who wants to hear a story?

{Chorus}
I know I’ve had a tough life, yeah
We’ve all have had a tough life, yeah
We’ve all went through tough times, yeah
You know you’ve have a tough life when

{Verse 1}
You know you’ve had a tough life
When nothing seems right, or goes right
Fear grips you tight and you're locked out lonely with frostbite
Frozen in the night, try to fight with all instinct
But no one seems to care to be listening
Feels like despair so you pop pills and other things down
Your head is so high in the air
But your soul’s so down to the ground
Flipped the switch, broke my wrist
With a twist, broke the dish
Choked the fish, I know about this
I lived with no sis, so pissed I kissed this chick
It was love that I missed shit, yeah! (Oh yeah-ha)
So crazy, how this love goes
And I’m fucking lazy
Don’t know what to do man
I groove like Jacey
Here we go, (yeah)
Here we go

{Chorus} (x2)
I know I’ve had a tough life, yeah
We’ve all have had a tough life, yeah
We’ve all went through tough times, yeah
You know you’ve have a tough life when

{Verse 2}
When you come home from school, work, shit, any tool
You try to utilize is useless, man, just talking makes you a fool
Your momma’s gone Krazy, like Lil Wayne, not Jay-Z
That mind has grown hazy, stress makes me turn lazy
Then you let out a whine,  and cry and she spits the shit
Shut up, I’m tryna do shit, stop being defiant
Fuck! You know what, that’s it, you’re dying!
Instead of being a mother who cares
She just wishes I was dead, you fucker!
Never had a happy dad or brother, yeah
Now when I see pain I suffer
‘Cause I know how this crisis made me tougher
So I’ll do whatever I can to just make a change
You know, how it’s strange, yeah, today

{Chorus} (x2)
I know I’ve had a tough life, yeah
We’ve all have had a tough life, yeah
We’ve all went through tough times, yeah
You know you’ve have a tough life when

{Verse 3}
Know you’ve had a tough life when
Nothing seems right, and you can’t survive anything (Catch a vibe)
Not alive, can’t survive, it feel like you’re dying
Don’t know where to go, so it’s like
What the fuck am I believing in (I’m lost, yo)
What the fuck is even worth dreaming in
Yeah I’m screaming and I can’t stop the tears from streaming
Down my face, yaaaoh

{Bridge}
Make me a dreamer
Make me a believer, in whatever I put my mind to
‘Cause you know what, in the end, it ain’t gonna end so well
Yaaaoh

{Verse 4}
For the lost kid who’s got no home
Or whatever, a broken family, anything you know, man
Feel disowned, or left out of the moment
You know what, you know it
You got what it takes, you’ve shown it (showed it)
You gonna shine bright (shine bright)
Everybody knows that
We gonna shine a light
Like we on fire (fire)
What you got to say?
I got to pray, I gotta pray, meditate
(Escape, escape) Anything I can do to escape
You got help man
Help from above
Ain’t anybody that can do that (no one can)
But God Himself y’all

{Chorus} (x2)
I know I’ve had a tough life, yeah
We’ve all have had a tough life, yeah
We’ve all went through tough times, yeah
You know you’ve have a tough life when
