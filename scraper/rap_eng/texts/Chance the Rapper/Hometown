[Hook]
Round my hometown
Memories are fresh
Round my hometown
Ooh the people I've met
Are the wonders of my world (x2)
Are the wonders of this world
Are the wonders of my world

[Verse 1]
She say she want to stay with the Bloods and Crips
Feel the front strips of inner-city cliques
Where free cunt strips and young blood drips
And kids fall through the holes of hollow gun tips
And you want to harm me, don't try to call me
You ain't gone calm me, you're slipping from my palm trees
Now baby please re-l-a-x
Together we 'bout as fly as LAX
And I don't want to have to call you my ex
Well babe, I don't want to have to call you collect
See, she say she got dreams to follow
How I'ma ever be her man, nigga, she wants to be a model
My sunshine in life got stole away
Once the Golden State took my gold away, Cali

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
You scold as you walk past her
No more truth lang, we only talk sarcasm
Truttin', outtin', need to be a model
Now you can catch me giving hickeys to beer bottles
Get it, cause I'm kissing the neck
Giving a heck for whether or not you give him respect
I know if you go, you just might glow
But if you leave, you could catch more than a cold
Bulimia, anorexia, you skip meals
You don't make the cut but that's how your wrist feel
Cause scripts rip slits in the hands of an actress
In the acting world, you'll find allies on the axis
You'll find actresses in alleys on their backs
With directors giving oral in return for a practice

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Trees, trees, please don't leave
But trees will be changed when it rains, will they shout to you
We was kissing under a tree when I fell for you
I thought that you was real, I guess I couldn't tell the truth
Trees go knee-deep in the dirt
They reach for the sky but they're still down to earth
But you, you just leave like leaves in the autumn
Didn't think you would get on, get gone, and just out 'em
Doubt them and reroute them, not count 'em
I'd never leave you for the chance of an album
Your roots stay deeper, I can't de-weed ya
I can't walk away, away from this tree, uh
And as bad as I want to see you running back
I could never ever ever be your lumberjack, Cali
