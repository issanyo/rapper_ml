[Intro: Donnie Trumpet Instrumental]

[Verse 1: Chance The Rapper]
Me mommy love me, like she love her nappy head
She sang me fables, when she used to wrap me dreads
She said me look like me grandpappy, now he dead
He never met me, but he loved me, yeah he did
He was a king, before me Ma became a queen
They killed him dead, because he tried to stop the war
Me momma love me, like the song that she sings
But I think she loves me just a little bit more

[Verse 2: Vic Mensa]
Little bit less, then little bit more
Hourglass, sand's timeless through my trough
Let it wash me away
Dive into a fifth of the J, Mo', sip it slow
Stone cold nights, warm days
Days don't break, they fade away
Faced my watch, then face a J
Faking it takes my pain away
Be a fatality, killed my salary
Dreams shattering, trunk rattling
Drug dabbling, dabble or dab
Bought a battery, energy, gpen
G when we go see this salary
Set a time bomb, 'til I blow up
Like the Matrix, in the zion

[Outro: Donnie Trumpet Instrumental]
