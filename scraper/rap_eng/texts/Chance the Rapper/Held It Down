[Intro]
Okay

[Chorus: Chance the Rapper]
My favorite cousin's back in town, we goin' out
We don't know where we're goin', we goin' out
And we took care of grandma, we held it down
And we took care of mama, we held it down
My favorite cousin's back in town, we goin' out
We don't know where we're goin', we goin' out
And we took care of grandma, we held it down
And we took care of mama, we held it down

[Verse 1: Chance the Rapper]
Bitch, don't play with my family, I keep with my family
Your ugly ass family
Your great-great grandmammy shoulda used Plan B
We petty, we ghetto
You touch it, you dead ho
And that's on my grandaddy's grave
I got my grandaddy's name
Set it off Big Daddy Kane
Tell all my cousins is bustin' and shakin' to come out the crib
Christmas is coming and I got a gift
I got some money, I might buy a zip
Back at the house where we used to play tips
We was carpoolin' before they made Lyft
Say no more cops before they can say dibs
Hot flamin's, bitch you not playing with my chips

[Pre-Chorus: Chance the Rapper]
I'm ready to die for my blood
You could get turned to a blunt
Keep acting crazy, you won't
Bitch I do all of my stunts
I'm ready to die for my blood
Ready to die by the love
We do this type shit for fun
Nigga what's up?

[Chorus: Chance the Rapper]
My favorite cousin's back in town, we goin' out
We don't know where we're goin', we goin' out
And we took care of grandma, we held it down
And we took care of mama, we held it down
My favorite cousin's back in town, we goin' out
We don't know where we're goin', we goin' out
And we took care of grandma, we held it down
And we took care of mama, we held it down

[Verse 2: Chance the Rapper]
Mama, I got that bill paid
Mama, I got that real estate
Get a house built like Bill Gates
Buy it back from the bank, more bang for your buck
Big 079 where I still stay
Slaughtered this shit for a gyro
Crash Bandicoot and some Spyro
Pull all that shit in my bio
Food stamps, we gotta link
Real blood, got the ink
Fuck what's comin' out the sink
I made a million like Tink
I'm jumpin' in, I won't think
I'm jumpin' in, I won't sink
You niggas flippin' like pink, they softer than mink

[Pre-Chorus: Chance the Rapper]
I'm ready to die for my blood
You could get turned to a blunt
Keep acting crazy, you won't
Bitch I do all of my stunts
I'm ready to ride for my blood
Ready to die for the love
We do this type shit for fun
Nigga, what's up?

[Chorus: Chance the Rapper]
My favorite cousin's back in town, we goin' out
We don't know where we're goin', we goin' out
And we took care of grandma, we held it down
And we took care of mama, we held it down
My favorite cousin's back in town, we goin' out
We don't know where we're goin', we goin' out
And we took care of grandma, we held it down
And we took care of mama, we held it down
