[Verse: Chance The Rapper]
We want some heroes in our story
We need highlights for a nightlight, we need glory for a while
We want results, we want results
Hit our families, hit our folks
Bombs bursting in air
Oh say
Can you see America's face?
We share a pair of parents, took good care of the place
We just want narrators to pick up the narrative's pace
Put on a show for us, float for us
Make it easy, make some more for us
Save the date
We want a W, we tired of picking different sides
I got your jersey, just a different size
We all want you to be a buzzer beater
Find us a leader far from Silent Bobs and Cousin Skeeters
Through the perilous fight, want you to be brave
You want to see a hero? You need a teammate

[Chorus: Chance The Rapper]
People, people, we the people would like you to know that wherever you go
We're right by your side
People, people, we the people would like you to know that wherever you go
We're right by your side

[Bridge: Jack Red]
And now that we made it
Came in with an angel around us
Put it all in what we doing next
Ooo you know we can't go without it
Never go alone it never lasts
So we get to make what we want
Home has come at last
Yeaaa

[Chorus: Chance The Rapper]
People, people, we the people would like you to know that wherever you go
We're right by your side
People, people, we the people would like you to know that wherever you go
We're right by your side
People, people, we the people would like you to know that wherever you go
We're right by your side
People, people, we the people would like you to know that wherever you go
We're right by your side
