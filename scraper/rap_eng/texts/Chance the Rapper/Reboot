[Intro: KAMI]
Comin in', comin' in
Yeah
Yeah

[Chorus: KAMI]
Drip water, I was selling seafood
Crash a coup, so I had to recoup
Hit a dealership, said I need two
Booted up, then I had to reboot
Drip water, I was selling seafood (selling seafood)
Crash a coup, so I had to recoup (I had to recoup)
Hit a dealership, said I need two
Booted up, then I had to reboot

[Verse 1: KAMI]
Yeah
Still all in these streets (yeah)
Hand to hand the dope, it's just lil' ol' me (just lil' ol' me)
Count some racks up, count some double D's
(Count some double D's)
It's just one of me, motherfuck my enemies
Bald head, just like 'Pac (Just like 2Pac)
I put tattoos on the top (I put t-tattoos on the top)
Very slight, diamond rocks
New jewels, I had to cop (I had to go there)

[Chorus: KAMI & Chance the Rapper]
Drip water, always selling seafood (selling seafood)
Crash a coup, so I had to recoup (I had to reboot)
Hit a dealership, said I need two (I needed two)
Booted up, then I had to reboot (I had to reboot)
Drip water, always selling seafood (I selling seafood)
Crash a coup, so I had to recoup (I had to recoup)
Hit a dealership, said I need two (I needed two)
Booted up, then I had to reboot

[Verse 2: Chance the Rapper]
F-fuckin' up a check on some black kids
Just took the Grammys out the plastic
Shoulda got my first one off the Acid
Still bang my hat on traffic
Sign me up, sign me up
My shooter in the mirror and he tryna hype me up
And y'all daughters keep on callin' 'cause my barber line me up
They keep trynna slop me up
They keep trynna slop me up

[Chorus: KAMI & Joey Purp]
Drip water, always selling seafood (selling seafood)
Crash a coup, so I had to recoup (I had to recoup)
Hit a dealership, said I need two (I need a two-piece)
Booted up, then I had to reboot (I had to reboot)
Drip water, always selling seafood (I selling seafood)
Crash a coup, so I had to recoup (I had to recoup)
Hit a dealership, said I need two (I need a two-piece)
Booted up, then I had to reboot

[Verse 3: Joey Purp]
I just got a check and put it all on a pendant
She in saks religiously that mean she sacrilegious
I ain't got a tinted, tryna let 'em know I'm in it
I been out of town but I'm still doing digits
R-I-P my niggas, free my niggas in a gang (yeah)
I might get a caddy 'cause I like the way I swang (swang)
Inside, peanut butter, outside, Plain Jane (yeah)
I just booted up and then I booted up again

[Chorus: KAMI & Joey Purp & Chance the Rapper]
Drip water, always selling seafood (selling seafood)
Crash a coup, so I had to recoup (I had to reboot)
Hit a dealership, said I need two (I need a two-piece)
Booted up, then I had to reboot
Drip water, always selling seafood (always selling seafood)
Crash a coup, so I had to recoup (I had to recoup)
Hit a dealership, said I need two (I need a two piece)
Booted up, then I had to reboot
