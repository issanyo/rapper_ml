[Intro: Chance The Rapper]
Happy Holidays

[Verse 1: Chance the Rapper]
She could say in her voice, in her way that she love me
With her eyes, with her smile, with her belt, with her hands, with her money
I am the thesis of her prayers
Her nieces and her nephews are just pieces of the layers
Only ones she love as much as me is Jesus Christ and Taylor
I got a future so I'm singing for my grandma
You singing too, but your grandma ain't my grandma
Mine's is hand made, pan fried, sun dried
Southside, and beat the devil by a landslide
Praying with her hands tied, president of my fan club, saying to her
Something told me I should bring my butt to church

[Hook: Jamila Woods]
You gotta move it slowly
Take and eat my body like it's holy
I've been waiting for you for the whole week
I've been praying for you, you're my Sunday candy

[Bridge: Jamila Woods]
Come on in this house, cause it's gonna rain
(*Mama you know it's gonna rain*)
Rain down Zion, it's gonna rain
(*Mama you know it's gonna rain*)

[Verse 2: Chance the Rapper]
I come to church for the candy, your peppermints is the truth
I'm pessimistic on Monday if I had tweaked and missed you
You look so good with that hat on, had to match with the shoes
Came and dressed in the satin, I came and sat in your pew
I come to Christmas for dinner, fifty rolls on my plate
Hella holes in my stocking holding your pockets in place
I like my love with a budget, I like my hugs with a scent
You smell like light, gas, water, electricity, rent
You sound like why the gospel choir got so tired
Singin his praises daily basis so I gotta try it
You're my dreamcatcher, dream team, team captain
Matter fact, I ain't seen you in a minute let me take my butt to church

[Bridge: Jamila Woods]
Come on in this house, cause it's gonna rain
(*Mama you know it's gonna rain*)
Rain down Zion, it's gonna rain
(*Mama you know it's gonna rain*)

[Verse 3: Chance the Rapper]
Mama you know, Mama you know its gonna rain
Father you know
Promised, you said it would rain, finally I'm home
You left on the light when I left on the flight, but I made it alright
I've been waiting all week, I've been waiting all night
Jason Van Dyke
Had to say something on Saturday
See you at Church on Sunday
Open Mike coming on Monday
I wonder what the internet gonna say
When SNL end with the Indie
Then the third tape slide down the chimney
Via Kirsten, Kinsley, Lisa, Kenny, Taylor, Wendy, Austin win the Emmy, Mama Jan too

[Bridge: Jamila Woods]
Come on in this house, cause it's gonna rain
(*Momma you know it's gone rain*)
Rain down Zion, it's gonna rain
