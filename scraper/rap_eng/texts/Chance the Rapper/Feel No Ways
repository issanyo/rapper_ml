[Verse 1]
I should be downtown, trippin on the way to you
You got something that belongs to me
Your body language says it all
Despite the things you said to me
Who is this that got you all gassed up?
Changin' your opinions on me
I was only gone for the last two months
But you don't have the time to wait on me

[Hook]
I tried with you
There's more to life than sleeping in and getting high with you
I had to let go of us to show myself what I can do
But that just didn't sit right with you
And now you're tryna make me feel a way, on purpose
Now you're throwing it back in my face, on purpose
Now you're throwing dirt on my name, on purpose
And you don't feel no way, you think I deserve it

[Post-Hook]
Feel a way, feel a way, feel a way
I've stopped listenin' to things you say
Cause you don't mean them anyway
Feel a way, feel a way, feel a way
Maybe we just should have did things my way
Instead of the other way

[Verse 2]
We need to breathe
There's more to life than hearing stuff and being mean to me
We had to let go of us to show ourselves what we can be
But that just didn't sit well with me
Tryna make me feel a way, on purpose
Throwing dirt on my name, in public
You don't feel no way, on purpose
I'm messing up all of Drake's words, on purpose.. careful
Careful
Be careful
Be careful
You could never be too careful

(I'm not a singer but BBC got me up very early in the morning)

[Verse 3]
Keep ya head away from windows
Keep your arms inside the ride
Trust me with ya body, trust me with ya life
Banging on the windows, baby come inside
Certainly in trouble, maybe you should hide
I'mma tell you like
Don't you look up to me, don't trust a word I say
Don't you end up like me, if you learn one thing today
Don't you look up to me, don't trust a word I say
Don't you end up like me, if you learn one thing today

[Outro]
Feel a way, feel a way, young nigga feel a way
Maybe we just should have did things this way
Instead of the other way
Instead of the other way
Feel a way, feel a way, young parents feel this way
Maybe we just should have did things this way
Instead of the other way
Instead of the other way
