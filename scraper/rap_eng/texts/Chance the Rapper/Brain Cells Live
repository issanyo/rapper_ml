[Intro]
Yeah
Oh, yeah y'all gon' let [?]
Swear y'all gon' [?]
Sing it, uh

[Chorus]
I burned too many brain cells down
To be worried 'bout my brain cells now, oh no
I burned too many brain cells down
To be worried 'bout my brain cells now, oh no
I burned too many brain cells down
To be worried 'bout my brain cells now
I burned too many brain cells down
Down, down, down-down, uh

[Verse 1]
Uh, here’s a tab of acid for your ear
You’re the plastic, I’m the passion and the magic in the air
The flabbergasted avalanche of ambulances near
The labyrinth of Pan’s Lab is adamantly here
No assignments, book of rhyming and I’m drawing doodles
I should rhyme rhyme with Ramen Noodles
Ramadan, I’m the don of the diamond jewels
Fond of finding a way to kindly tell these toddlers toodles
I’m a kamikaze and I’m kinda cuckoo
I could write a fucking book, non-Kamasutral
You niggas goofies, it's a conflict that is kinda crucial
Caught you on the 9 in all blue yelling, "I’m a neutral"
But I’ma let the bull pass like matadors
Versus a Minotaur, verse is a metaphor
Metamorphoses and I’m a fuckin animorph
I used to go to school with Anna Fedele and Danny Whorf
Remember I used to bang with the bad ones
'Til my grandmama told on her grandson
Mama said that I was way too handsome
To be throwing the hand’s son, breaking walls like Samson
But I’ma throw a tantrum 'til I’m on every Samsung
Sanyo and handheld and handgun
Please put ya lighter’s up 'til life is up, then light it up
And slice a cut, the night is young, it’s nice enough
The nicest blunt, the nicest stuff
My niggas out here trapping a lot
I know you think you on, hiding Reggie sacks in your socks
I hang with niggas, whole jab in the jock
.4’s for 15, yeah my niggas, we be taxing a lot
Only the goofies, though, choking on a doobie, though
My eyes do be low, two be rolled, remember days of the Rufio
Remember the Days of Chan-Man and the Skeeter Man
Brrang dang to Lil' B and bang a-rang to Peter Pan

[Chorus]
I burned too many brain cells down
To be worried 'bout my brain cells now, oh no
I burned too many brain cells down
To be worried 'bout my brain cells now, oh no
I burned too many brain cells down
To be worried 'bout my brain cells now
I burned too many brain cells down
Down, down, down-down, uh

[Verse 2]
Light a joint, or spliff it if you classy
Split a swisha witcha nigga if you ask me
Ain't no questions, hit it vividly and pass me
Don’t answer about your problems
Or your issues or your athletes
It’s a quarter to imminent, ten minutes to infinite
Rims, Henny, and reminisce, nostalgia and M&M's
Cinnamon tone women and feminine’s getting intimate
All broads is frivolous and homies could get they dividends
Damn, is he illiterate, literal syndicate
Illegitimate, idiot, gangbanger-affiliate
Sick twisted prick, dick sadistic
Son of a biscuit, man fuck this shit, uh

[Chorus]
I burned too many brain cells down
To be worried 'bout my brain cells now
I burned too many brain cells down
To be worried 'bout my brain cells now, oh no
I burned too many brain cells down
To be worried 'bout my brain cells now
I burned too many brain cells down
Down, down, down-down

[Outro]
Oh no, no, no
Oh no, no
Oh no, no, no, no
And this is my 10 Day
This is my 10 Day, oh no
Welcome 10 Day
Hahaha, word
