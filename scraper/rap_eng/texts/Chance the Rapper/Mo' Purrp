[Hook: Kembe X]
I got ten hoes on ten hoes
Been throwed off indo
The Benzo's a fishbowl, no tints on my windows
Gettin' chose by them hoes
My sis knows from En Vogue
These blunts can't get no bigger
I'm doing hoodrat shit with my niggas x2

[Verse 1: Alex Wiley]
44's I'm tippin', big blunts I'm splittin'
These bitches be bitter, heard me spit, now she strippin'
Cause this Village shit too hittin', and you know we gon' grind
In your lovely crib with your lovely bitch, but I hope you don't mind
Cause I'm ridin' 'round with my dick out, Toyota Prius is tricked out
Yo' grandmama taking me shopping, she's buying whatever I picked out
And you know The Village gon' stick out like a sore thumb, bitch I'm goin' dumb
Hotboxing the whip, ain't stoppin' for shit
When you hear the fucks, then you know what's up
You ain't down with that money team!
10 Honda Civics, parked outside
Fuck Whoopie G for 100 Gs? Hit me up, Whoopie, I'm 'bout that life
'Bout that life, thick than a motherfuckin' Snicker
All I wanna do every day of my life is hoodrat shit with my niggas

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Chance the Rapper]
Get off, sick cough, hit licks, don't get caught
Kidnap like Jigsaw, Big Meech, bitch, I'm Rick Ross
Got a odd to the liquor, got a Swisher to the weed
That's that Save Money militia till my niggas rest in peace
Hit that Zan, that's my dance, that's just Chance rappin' raps
In the land with the fam, and my man's super slapped
Throwing bands in the stands to my Stan's, them my fans
This for real, this for free, this for playing at the trap
Good God, them good raps, you gave up for them hoodrats
Been a Long Time, since Hey Ma'cause you burned down on your good shit, like Fuck is You Tahmbout?
Trill niggas still switchin' lanes, lil' niggas still hit them stains
Real niggas still hit them bangs
