[Hook]
Cruisin' in my 6-4, damn I got a sick flow
Cruisin' in my 6-4, damn I got a sick flow
Cruisin' in my 6-4, you know I got a sick flow
Ask me where I'm headed to
Askin' what they askin' for

[Verse]
Album full of hits, pocket full of tricks
Bag full of green, mouth full of swish
Ear full of Chronic album, head full of dead cells
Cap full of afro, hand full of steering wheel
Cruise past the bus stop, 2 miles per hour
Air condition blowin' with the windows rolled down
And I turn it up cause the speakers full of bass
And I pull down the top cause the air's full of grape
With a hand full of cockiness
Back seat full of hoes
Clip full of BBC, backpack full of clothes
Neck full of gold ropes, ear full of diamonds
Woke up from the dream I ain't even got my licence
Shit

[Hook]
Cruisin' in my 6-4, damn I got a sick flow
Cruisin' in my 6-4, you know I got a sick flow
Cruisin' in my 6-4, damn I got a sick flow
Ask me where I'm headed to
Askin' what they askin' for
What they askin' for? What the fuck they askin' for?
Fuck they askin' for?
