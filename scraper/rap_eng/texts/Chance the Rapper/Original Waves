[Choir Enters while humming]

[Verse: 1]
Sun don't shine in the shade
Birds don't fly in a cage (Hey)
Even when somebody pass away
They don't ever really go away

[Pre-Hook]
That's just the waves

[Hook]
Waves don't die
Ay Ay Ay
Waves don't die
Ay Ay Ay

[Chorus: Choir and Chance the Rapper]
Ohh, yeah Ohh, yeah
Ohh, yeah Ohh, yeah
(hey ay ay)
Ohh, yeah Ohh, yeah

[Verse: 2]
Wanna see the bricks' right
Tired of getting swished like
They want me on the bench like
