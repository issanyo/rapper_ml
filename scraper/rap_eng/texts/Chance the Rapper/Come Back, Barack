[Intro: Chance The Rapper & Chris Redd]
Ooh
Yeah, yeah yeah, yeah

[Verse 1: Chance The Rapper, Kenan Thompson & Chris Redd]
This time of year I get thankful, baby
Thankful for you
But now you're gone
And I don't know what to do
And you were so intelligent
You were so strong
Waited my whole life for you
So damn long
And now I see you moving on
And I beg you to come back home

[Bridge: All & Chris Redd]
And every night I turn the TV on and cry (and I cry, and I cry)
I say why, I feel like we're all going to die (no, no, no, no, no, no)

[Chorus: All, Chance The Rapper & Kenan Thompson]
So come back, Barack
Even though it's not allowed (no, no, no)
We want you back somehow
I need you in my life
So come back, Barack (look at us, man)
We didn't know just what we had (we lit 200 candles for you)
Now things are looking bad
Like really bad
Like "World War" bad
Like "Nuclear" bad (I'm sweating through my damn scarf)
So come back, Barack

[Verse 2: Chance The Rapper, Kenan Thompson & Chris Redd]
I see you're hang-gliding, living your life
Dropping your daughter off at college with your wife
And y'all look so damn happy
And you deserve it, yeah
But I'm a selfish man
And I know there's other democrats
More than just a few
But when I think of change
The only change I want is you

[Bridge: All & Chris Redd]
I'm in hell
Dreaming about you and Michelle (I'm dreaming baby, oh yeah)

[Chorus: All, Chris Redd & Chance The Rapper]
So come back, Barack (come on man, we out in the rain)
Don't leave us here alone (it's definitely too cold to be in the rain though)
At least pick up the phone (I mean, I know you busy with that library and everything)
The White House ain't a home (but Trump ain't even got a dog, man)
Just come back, Barack

[Interlude: Kenan Thompson]
You know it's been a long time, Barack
Almost as long as since a guy talked over a record like this
But for real, why would you leave us?
Oh, 'cause you had to? Because of the constitution?
But you can come back right? Oh, you can't?
'Cause that would undermine the very institutions that we're barely holding on to as it is? I see
I guess we stuck with this dude for a while then
Maybe you can come back and make a speech
How much would that cost? For real?
Oh no, we definitely can't afford that
So I'm just getting rained on for nothing
That's interesting
Well, you enjoy your retirement, homie

[Chorus: All, Chance The Rapper & Kenan Thompson]
So come back, Barack (get change)
We need you, oh so bad (super bad)
2020's looking sad (maybe Michelle could run)
Like really sad
Like super sad
"What the hell we gonna do?" sad (no, let's not put Michelle through that)
Come back, Barack (but if she wanted to)

[Interlude: Kenan Thompson & Chris Redd]
I'd vote for Joe Biden
Or what about George Clooney?
I mean, that dude was Batman
That'd be cool
You know what, I don't think the 3 of us have the firmest grasp on government
But hey, happy Thanksgiving everybody

[Outro: All]
Come back, Barack
