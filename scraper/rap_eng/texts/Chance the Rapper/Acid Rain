(Intro)
Yeah
La, la, la, la, la, la, la,la, la
Yeah
Listen

(Verse 1:Mugz)
Didn't your momma tell you not to spit in the wind
Didn't your momma tell you that if you quit you don't win
So what is it I truly strive for
Looking for opportunity is like Tryna knock on every door
In a hotel
I still feel like Adele
I guess the hood is like hell
Cause they say if you pray
Then you prey like a gazelle in the Savannah
Almost got robbed for my jewels but I didn't all thanks goes to this hammer
I'm a good kid trapped in a city where busting gats and slinging crack is all glamour
Half of my class mates turned to cell mates and they spend most of they time in the slammer
Listen

(Bridge)
Rain makes worse
Like I got arthritis
Every worse is worth, the touch of Midas
I'm sick of being sick, I called life's virus
You could never understand the stuff that came across my iris

(Verse 2:Mugz)
I'm so blessed, achoo, excuse me
Critics think less, so I chew, any beat
But bragging is as meaningless as my mother nagging asking me not to do shit that I'll probably still do
"Don't do drugz Mugz " , ha, I was getting High after school
True I had a tool, but didn't wanna be a goon
Cause what it's like when you feel the pressure of the moon and the whole universe is on top of your shoulders
So don't ask me bout the smell on my shirt those maintaining odors
No job and poverty turned us to smokers
Smoke leaving my lungs like broke down motors

(Bridge 2)
And that acid, that acid, that acid
The reason why I'm feeling so flaccid
What I am is Michael Jordan if he didn't get drafted
Now I'm a savage rabbit that's rabid
Ugh
I'm having a hard time getting through hard times
I'm having a hard time reading between the lines

(Verse 3:Mugz)
So tell me straight up what it's  gon be
Before I Kurt cobain my dome piece
My tears burn like acid rain
Hotter than lava that'll melt any grain
Of happiness that once was
It's krazy what one does
Just to get a little buzz
Like a shot of that vodka
Girl you wanna fuss
I hate the drama

(Hook)
La la la la la la, la la la

(Verse 4:Chance)
Smoking cigarettes to look cooler
I only stop by to look through ya
And I'm only getting greedier
And I'm still Mr. Youmedia
And I still can't find Talent
And I'm still choosing classmates that wouldn't fuck
Mom still thinks I should go back to school
And Justin still thinks I'm good enough
And Mama Jan still don't take her meds
And I still be asking God to show his face
And I still be asking God to show his face

[Outro]
I am a new man, I am sanctified
Oh, I am holy, I have been baptized
I have been born again, I am the White Light
Rain, rain don't go away
