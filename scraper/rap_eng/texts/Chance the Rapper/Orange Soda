[Prod. by Cam:] (Making the Beat)

[Intro]

[Hook]
To get you what you need
Make you love it, make you want it
Cause baby you are so amazing
To get you what you need
Make you love it, make you want it
Cause baby you are so amazing
To get you what you need
Make you love it, make you want it
Cause baby you are so amazing

[Verse 1: Vic Mensa]
Pack the bong, pack the bong, pack the bong, pack it
I'm Pacquiao on the track, flow the tempo you should tap it
Tap out or blackout, black is beautiful say yes indeed
Leave my demons in the dust, conducting electricity
I'm Silkk the Shocker with a fifth of vodka
Bag of drugs in my knickerbockers
Bach on the staff sheet, trying to pen an opera
Sounds so beautiful
Fogging my bifocals window shopping at the Gucci store
Know when you want it, but just can't have it
Especially as an artist, don't that shit make you mad
Just breathe, breathe, breathe, it's all in your head
Know these labels wanna sign me for an arm and a leg
Cut my publishing in half like I have to fold (Origami)
For a dollar, what's a half of a half a whole
Quarter water or Courvoisier
Complicate things when money's what you conversate
But this is just so that you know

[Hook]
To get you what you need
Make you love it, make you want it
Cause baby you are so amazing
To get you what you need
Make you love it, make you want it
Cause baby you are so amazing
To get you what you need
Make you love it, make you want it
Cause baby you are so amazing

[Verse 2: Vic Mensa]
Hold up, hold up, hold up, yo wait up, wait up, I'ma let you finish
But finna be famous one day just really ain't where I fit in
Fell in love when I was fifteen, I guess you could call it tennis
My tendency for this music is so much deeper than business
I build a beat in the morning, record it before the evening
Why is it what seems important seems always to be misleading
I wish I could see the future, just wish I could see the future
Tell me everything be okay just like my momma used to
My youths unfolding before me, be twenty before I know it
I'm trying to write my Illmatic, get TVs that's panoramic
Was riding around in a rental and I don't mean it was rented
Totalled my momma's Prius, I vaguely remember spinning
I fell asleep from the studio
Must've been saved cause no one hit me
They made a list about Chicago rappers and they skipped me
Maybe because I'm so much more
Forget what you not, this is about what you are

[Hook]
To get you what you need
Make you love it, make you want it
Cause baby you are so amazing
To get you what you need
Make you love it, make you want it
Cause baby you are so amazing
To get you what you need
Make you love it, make you want it
Cause baby you are so amazing
