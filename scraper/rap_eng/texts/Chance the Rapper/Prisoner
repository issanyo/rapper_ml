[Verse 1: Jordan Bratton]
Just because it glows, that doesn't mean everything's on show
No riches don't make a happy home
No riches don't compensate for soul
Diamond just a stone
She gives everything to something that don't mean anything
But that's all she knows
She'll never go back the way she came, came
Now is this just a prisoner without a cage?
Not a life she chose but she followed the gold code it wrote
What she wanted, it couldn't be sold
She started to lose her way
You didn't take communion after the sermon
You don't believe there's a God above you
With His plan for you
So you sniff it and drink and changin' who you are
Things that make you feel alive, somethin' wrong with that
But I feel for you

[Hook: Jordan Bratton]
Now is this just a prisoner without a cage?
So trapped in this life, you better make it out alive
You better give it another try or you won't make it out alive

[Verse 2: Chance The Rapper]
Cage bird singin' on tour
Just an amateur tryna mature
Grew so fast that she never grew up
Got to move somewhere new just cause its newer
Everyday it rain where she live, she say you lettin' all the air out
TVs are for windows where she stare out
Extra hours at parties
Tryna find some jacket she don't even care about
She ain't even wear it out
Building nests on arms, Breast so warm
You think of mother's bosom
She's so green you'd flip but probly shouldn't
I hope she catch her tail and her circles get smaller
Before the drill ain't a drill and the wolf is for real
And the wolf is for real

[Hook]
Now is this just a prisoner without a cage?
So trapped in this life, you better make it out alive
You better give it another try or you won't make it out alive

[Outro: Jordan Bratton]
Now silent and slowly
After a while she's lonely
She waits to die
A livin' waste of time
All this green, no blue skies
All sunny days are cold as ice
The frozen sun she's trapped inside
Is it just, is it just a prisoner without a cage?
