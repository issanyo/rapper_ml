[Intro]
Na, Na, Na...

[Verse 1]
Do you ever get sad and listen to sad songs?
It makes you sadder
My face is a tad long
Trying to think positively only got me worried
All these fleeting ambitions of you and I have been buried
Wore my feelings under my long sleeve
Hoping to wake up from this bad dream
I need me-time
What does that mean?
And now I'm hitting up Ashley while you're hitting up Bradley
There are no second thoughts about it
Tears are making my vision clouded
And I don't know what to do about it...
And I don't know what to do about it...
And you aren't taking my advice
Remember when we rode bikes
And everything was alright
Childish dreams were in sight
Willing to put up a fight
And you are so my type
Mystery in your eyes but somewhere deep down inside you know exactly who you are
And who you want to be
It's just a matter of seeing it
Let alone believing it!

[Outro]
Na, Na, Na...
