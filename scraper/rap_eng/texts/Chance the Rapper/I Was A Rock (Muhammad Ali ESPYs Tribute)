[Intro: Kid and Muhammad Ali]
Kid: "I'd like to know what you're going to do when you retire from boxing?"
Ali: "I really don't know, I want to say something right here this might make you all think. When I get out of Boxing or when I'm through, I want to do all I can to help people. What's the best thing I can do? Get ready to meet God."

[Verse 1: Chance the Rapper]
Back in time
I lost track of time
Rolling on the road
Christmas Eves and Valentines
Seemed like the days before
I came I went I did well
I did I really meant well
But I almost missed my beat
So thank you for saving me a seat

[Bridge: Chance the Rapper]
I swear ain't no where greater
Ain't no where brighter
Ain't no where better, better, better, better
Ain't no one prettier
Ain't no one wiser
Ain't no where better, better

[Muhammad Ali]
God is watching me
God don’t praise me because I beat Joe Frazier
God don’t give nothing about Joe Frazier
God don’t care nothing about England or America
As far as wealth
It’s all his
He wants to know how do we treat each other
How do we help each other

[Chorus: Chance the Rapper + Choir]
I was a rock
I was a rock and roller
Back in my day (Back in my day)
But now I'm just a rock (I was a rock)
I was a rock and roller
Back in my day (Back in my day)
But now I'm just a rock
I was a rock

[Verse 2: Chance the Rapper]
Steady hold
I've grown weary and old
We're as close as we'll ever be
I was gone I had places to be
And of course you're in the last place I look

[Bridge: Chance the Rapper]
I swear ain't no where greater
Ain't no where brighter
Ain't no where better, better, better, better
Ain't no one prettier
Ain't no one wiser
Ain't no one better, better

[Pre-Chorus: Chance the Rapper]
And I'm still standing here
Standing still
I won't be moved
How used to do when

[Chorus: Chance the Rapper + Choir]
I was a rock
I was a rock and roller
Back in my day (Back in my day)
But now I'm just a rock (I was a rock)
I was a rock
I was a rock and roller
Back in my day (Back in my day)
But now I'm just a rock
I was a rock (I was a rock)
I was a rock and roller
Back in my day (Back in my day)
But now I'm just a rock (I was a rock)
I was a rock and roller
Back in my day (Back in my day)
But now I'm just a rock
I was a rock
