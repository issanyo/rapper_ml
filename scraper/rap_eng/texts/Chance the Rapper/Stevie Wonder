[Verse 1: Chance The Rapper]
I had a vision
And the vision was a tunnel with a door
Like a funnel for precision
Just a mission , no decision
Narrowing as it beckons me
More of a slide than a hallway
More of a hive than a hiding place
More of a hike than a walk or a stroll
It's a stride through a hole
In the wall in a crawl space
I be xanned like a motherfucker
Zonin like a motherfucker
Bars like a motherfucker
Gone like a motherfucker
Smart like a nigga went to Jones like a motherfucker
Gettin' grown like a motherfucker
Push-ups getting strong like a motherfucker
I'm in my zone motherfucker
I'm be zonin motherfucker
I'm in the zonin...

[Bridge: Chance The Rapper]
You ain't been where I been (No, no, no)
You sure ain't seen what I seen (No he didn't, no he didn't)
Round these nigga, Round these nigga
Round these nigga, Round these niggas
I can't see a thing (In my zone)
I can't see a thing
You ain't been where I been
You ain't seen what I seen
When I'm around these niggas
I swear I can't see a thing (In my zone now)
I can't see a thing (In my zone)
I can't see a thing
In my zone, in my zone, in the zone, in the zone

[Verse 2: Lucki Eck$]
Shit, I got the world in my hand with some dice little nigga, I'm rolling
I got Google I don't need your advice old nigga, I'm zonin'
I'm Tom Brady '03, '07, little nigga, I'm golden
The bitch we ghost ridin' off of two little niggas she rollin
The fourth day in a row and I know itâ€™s wrong been driving all in my pivot
Been passing smooth the whole drive
Just hope the Lord will come pick it
And them HBK's been kickin'
Been fucking around with these heartbreaks
I keep it moving, no slippin'
The banana peels falling your way its like

[Outro]
You feel it (I can't see a thing)
I know you feel it
I know you feel it (I can't see a thing, We zonin')
You feel it (We zonin')
I know you feel it (We zonin')
I know you feel it (We zonin')
We zonin'
