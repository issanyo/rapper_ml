[Verse 2 - Chance The Rapper]
She the type that type love notes
She like lucy and love boats
She the type that like butt jokes
But not being the butt
She in the cut
But being secret is cutthroat
And being lonely is cut wrist
So giving head doesn't cut close
Getting faded and fuck on a slut slit
She the type to do tai-chi
Exercise in the Chi
Sippin chai tea
Pics of her thighs on her IG
But high key she a bust
She a tease, she a bop
She a sleaze
Jesus christ she's shiesty
Heidi-Heidi-Heidi ho
I-d I-d I-D-K if I ever wanna say
Hello to this stank breath bitch, ho

[Verse 3 - Kami de Chukwu]
Novacane and a hershey's kiss
Sugar rush fly off a gum drop roll
Heavy they heart, hold the weight of lost worlds
Say the world was mine and what's mine was yours
Never, I stay selfish
I stay deep as the sea floor
You ain't live enough life till you seen a sore sight
Now you'll probably C4
Lost peace found grief now they eyes fill with rainfall
Tear me a page in your books about me
Flowers decay y'all
And I hope every voice lift
When they try to sing about me
Who the man with the power
Same man hold the powder
She the type that's gotta have it
If you fam you eat
If you love you feast
Soul food with a side of sammy - surf

[Verse 4 - Tokyo Shawn]
I'm the type to never answer
But she the type to always call
She say that she wanna travel
She say she wanna go to Tokyo
Like hey what your name is
I'm famous it's nice to meet you
After conversational time wasting
And temptations
Say she the type to that probably talk about you to people
I say no that she the type that show up at a party to see you
And say I need you
I'm ridin, but I'm rollin
Rollin inside of stolen
But I'm posted
Imposin if I get noticed
Impulsively ibuprofen
I be coaching
Approachin with chronic focus
Chronic smokin
Highest dosage
High and lows got me roller coasting
Wait
Then I ask can you stay?
Hey, can you please save me today?
She the type to contemplate
While I try to make it hard to concentrate
All the things I gotta say
Get put on layaway until the day they rot away
