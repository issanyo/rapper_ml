[Intro]
My hands were eyes
Were closed and tied
They always told me I was blind
I couldn't see beyond the lies

[Verse 1]
Falling was all I knew
Moving too fast
No foot on solid ground
How could I last
Falling was all I knew
Moving too fast
No foot on solid ground
How could I last

[Chorus: The O'Mys + Chance The Rapper]
There was no light
Nothing but rain
So glad that I know
So glad I know, so glad I know
There was no light (I had to feel to find my way)
Nothing but rain
Washing over me
So glad that I know (So glad)
Finally found it shining (Shining)

[Verse 2: Chance the Rapper]
The map was useless
The captain clueless
The crew was hopeless
The code was Rubiks
The cold was ruthless
The wind was music
Fantasizing 'bout diamonds
Shining like Stanley Kubrick
Mud sloshing, swash-buckling
Mop bucket
Clean enough to see your reflection
And not touch it
Clear enough to hear your own mind
And not trust it
Close enough that the goal became dry land
And sirens sang of home
And the boat became an island
Cash turn to ash once the sea became silent
No one saw it coming man they all gone
Everybody except Paul, man Paul walked home (IGH!)

[Chorus: The O'Mys + Chance The Rapper]
There was no light (there was no light, there was no light, UGH)
Nothing but rain (Nothing but rain, nothing but rain)
So now that I know (so glad, so glad, so glad)
So glad I know, so glad I know

[Bridge]
I had to feel to find my way
When I was down and out
I cracked this holy ground (washing over me)
Washing over me yeah
So glad, so glad
Finally found somebody
Finally found you

[Chorus]
There was no light
Nothing but rain
So now that I know
So glad I know
So glad that I know
When there was no light
There was no light
When there was no light
There was no light
When there was no light
