[Verse 1: Chance the Rapper]
Yo, I see you chilling on some pompous shit
Laid back with the squares like rhombuses
It's hard for me to approach as it is
It's hard for me to talk with my throat, heaven is
Shoes that is busted up, feeling dirty and scared
But I can be in a tux and still feel unprepared
My palms was sweaty
My heart was heavy
My palms was needy
My heart was ready
To be broken and then to be fixed, and I'mma let it
So I ask what time it is (is) and where you're headin
As time went on I got the nerve and said
"let's grab a bite and a movie and we can
Head back to my crib and maybe chill in my bed
Maybe have a couple of kids and get wed and"
She said "yeah, but you need to slow it" but
That's where it went, cause now you're less
Of a date and more of a best friend
And I thought my best friend would be more of a best man
I thought that maybe you who was right on Princeton
But I guess you decided that you wasn't impressed when

[Pre-Hook]
I wanted you to be in my lifeline
There's something about us you just might find
Peculiar, I'm not in my right mind
She quietly said that "it's not the right time"

[Hook: Daft Punk]
It might not be the right time
I might not be the right one
But there's something about us I want to say
Cause there's something between us anyway

[Verse 2: Chance the Rapper]
I may not be Mr. Right
But I can be your Mr. Right Now
You put songs into my head
That I just gotta write down
You're looking for something serious perhaps
I can be more than a dude that just makes you laugh
I can be more there, and less up in the lab
I'm just trying to get cash for us to live lav
So you can ride around in Porsches, and poor little recording
About horses wearing brands that cause shit
Seeing you hurt just leaves me nauseous
I wanna buy you masseuses and massages
But instead I just buy a bazooka
Take out the missiles and into all my nukkas
Give you all the time in the world
My world is less worldly without my girl
I know to you, that might sound deep and shit
But it just means you let me know why I exist so
I understand why you are pissed but
Understand without my world, it's just abyss

[Pre-Hook]
I wanted you to be in my lifeline
There's something about us you just might find
Peculiar, I'm not in my right mind
She quietly just said that "it's not the right time"

[Hook: Daft Punk]
It might not be the right time
I might not be the right one
But there's something about us I want to say
Cause there's something between us anyway

[Outro: Daft Punk]
I need you more than anything in my life
I want you more than anything in my life
I'll miss you more than anyone in my life
I love you more than anyone in my life
