[Intro]
Watch cases are convenient hiding places
The value of drugs [?] is enormous
Recently, a huge supply of heroin was taken
It was concealed in a powdery, harmless shipment of 35 barrels of olive oil
The deadly drug was burned in an incinerator of the Bureau of Engraving and Printing
And more vicous, more deadly than these soul destroying drugs is the menace of marijuana

[Chorus]
I burned too many brain cells down
To be worried 'bout my brain cells now
I burned too many brain cells down
To be worried 'bout my brain cells now
I burned too many brain cells down
To be worried 'bout my brain cells now
I burned too many brain cells down

[Verse 1]
Uh, here’s a tab of acid for your ear
You’re the plastic, I’m the passion and the magic in the air
The flabbergasted avalanche of ambulances near
The labyrinth of Pan’s Lab is adamantly here
No assignments, book of rhyming and I’m drawing doodles
I should rhyme rhyme with Ramen Noodles
Ramadan, I’m the don of the diamond jewels
Fond of finding a way to kindly tell these toddlers toodles
I’m a kamikaze and I’m kinda cuckoo
I could write a fucking book, non-Kamasutral
You niggas goofies, it's a conflict that is kinda crucial
Caught you on the 9 in all blue yelling, "I’m a neutral"
But I’ma let the bull pass like matadors
Versus a Minotaur, verse is a metaphor
Metamorphoses and I’m a fuckin anamorph
I used to go to school with Anna Fedele and Danny Whorf
Remember I used to bang with the bad ones
'Til my grandmama told on her grandson
Mama said that I was way too handsome
To be throwing the hand’s son, breaking walls like Samson
But I’ma throw a tantrum 'til I’m on every Samsung
Sanyo and handheld and handgun
Please put ya lighter’s up 'til life is up, then light it up
And slice a cut, the night is young, it’s nice enough
The nicest blunt, the nicest stuff
My niggas out here rapping a lot
I know you think you on, hiding Reggie sacks in your socks
I hang with niggas, whole jab in the jock
.4’s for 15, yeah my niggas, we be taxing a lot
Only the goofies, though, choking on a doobie though
My eyes do be low, two be rolled, remember days of the Rufio
Remember the Days of Chan-Man and the Skeeter Man
Brrang dang to Lil' B and bang a-rang to Peter Pan

[Chorus]
I burned too many brain cells down
To be worried 'bout my brain cells now
I burned too many brain cells down
To be worried 'bout my brain cells now
I burned too many brain cells down
To be worried 'bout my brain cells now
I burned too many brain cells down
Uh, uh, uh-uh

[Verse 2]
Light a joint, or spliff it if you classy
Split a swisha witcha nigga if you ask me
There's no skipping, hit it vividly and pass me
Don’t answer about your asthma
Or your issues or your Ashleys
It’s a quarter to imminent, ten minutes to infinite
Rims, Henny, and reminisce, nostalgia and M&M's
Feminine’s getting intimate, cinnamon tone women
And homies could get they dividends, all broads is frivolous
Damn, is he illiterate, literal syndicate
Illegitimate, idiot, gangbanger-affiliate
Sick twisted prick, dick sadistic
Son of a biscuit, man fuck this shit
Hold up, I need a roll up
Better yet, I need to roll up
Mama always glad Mary showed up
After the show, let's put a zone up
Zone out, smoke up, blunts, bongs and [?]
Yep, haha

[Bridge]
I smoked too many Js right now
I smoked too many Js right now, right now, right now
I burned too many brain cells down
I burned too many brain cells down

[Chorus]
I burned too many brain cells down
To be worried 'bout my brain cells now
I'm burning up my brain cells now
I'm burning up my brain cells now
I burned too many brain cells down
To be worried 'bout my brain cells now
I burned too many brain cells down
Down, down, down-down
