[Intro: sampled]
Within their dark universe, they’ve evolved a rigid society

[Hook]
Oh fuck, oh shit
Oh gosh, what is this
Shit shit shit, should I end it
I think my ass just got suspended
14,400 minutes
864,000 seconds
Pray to God I don't go to hell
240 hours, spend it well
I think my ass just got suspended
(240 hours, spend it well)
Don't you forget that first amendment
(240 hours, spend it well)
I think my ass just got suspended
(240 hours, spend it well)

[Verse 1]
I think my ass just got suspended
Side of the story, they just bend it
Damn this shit reminiscent of Bennett
I’m ringing in that superintendent
You can free me but not my dick
Jeopardizing that for that little bitch
Victimizing getting them itchy
I’m shifty, with the held liability
This banshee hold against me
I’m edgy, totally not joking
Cause the police act like I’m smoking cocaine
Give occifer a little Pepsi
This dude like Lucifer, killing my rep
Treating me like a murderer, a shittalking fiend
Making CDs with too many memes
Keep your mouth shut, that’s their advice to me
Risotto Pavarotti drinking iced tea
Can't go to parties cause they hate me
Angst

[Hook]
Oh fuck, oh shit
Oh gosh, what is this
Shit shit shit, should I end it
I think my ass just got suspended
14,400 minutes
864,000 seconds
Pray to God I don't go to hell
240 hours, spend it well
I think my ass just got suspended
(240 hours, spend it well)
Don't you forget that first amendment
(240 hours, spend it well)
I think my ass just got suspended
(240 hours, spend it well)

[Verse 2]
Then I’m kicked out, they think I’m a threat
Motherfuckers wanna make me grieve and regret
Not gonna blame Steve for any of that
But reasons why you know I got plenty of that
They think I’m a threat, they shit on my rep
10 day suspension, now that’s what I get
Are you scared of Fried Rice, got that feeling in your gut
Bear to lay your eyes, kneeling to The Perfect Nut
Listen to my song "Memes" and tell me I’m scary
I’m a little bitch, chest barely that hairy
But I’m fairly certain on how I can fix this
Tie the knot, kick the chair, and iation asphyx
Cannot breathe the air - during suicide tricks
No one on my side pricks, guess that’s too hard, bitch
Let’s fly away we might meet God
Smoking high today like our lungs filled with tar
Let’s go to a world other than her’s
Let’s go high to motherfucking Mars

[Hook]
Oh fuck, oh shit
Oh gosh, what is this
Shit shit shit, should I end it
I think my ass just got suspended
14,400 minutes
864,000 seconds
Pray to God I don't go to hell
240 hours, spend it well
I think my ass just got suspended
(240 hours, spend it well)
Don't you forget that first amendment
(240 hours, spend it well)
I think my ass just got suspended
(240 hours, spend it well)
