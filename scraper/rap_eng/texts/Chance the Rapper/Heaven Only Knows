[Chorus 1: Lido (Towkio)]
That's why I love it, I love it
Love it, I love it, love it, I love it
That's why I love it, I love it
Love it, I love it, love it, I love it
That's why I love it, I love it
Love it, I love it, love it, I love it (SaveMoney)
That's why I love it, I love it
Love it, I love it

[Verse 1: Towkio]
Uh, look
My girl tripping, say I treat her like a groupie
But I never took a groupie out to eat, uh
See I been ballin', I been poppin', I been bubblin', I been buzzin'
In my city women love me, think I'm pretty and they confirm it
Whenever they see me in person
If I said it I meant it, I said it on purpose, don't sleep on that furnace
'Cause, boy, we hot, ain't it my job to make you think
And make music that you feel? Then these songs should make you sing
Woah—woah—woah, I guess we never know
(Heaven only knows) What we need to know, where we need to go
Mind in the right field like I'm Ichiro
I shed light, they need to grow, fuck 'em all, fuck they friends, fuck they car
Fuck your brand, fuck your blog, it's SaveMoney
We a army full of generals here to push the envelope
And change what they think, it's my job to make them think
And make music that they feel, so these songs make them sing like:

[Chorus 2: Towkio & Eryn Allen Kane]
Woah—woah—woah
Where the end will go?
Will I ever know? Heaven only knows
Heaven only knows
Woah—woah—woah
Where the end will go?
Will I ever know? Heaven only knows
Heaven only knows

[Chorus 1: Lido (Chance the Rapper)]
That's why I love it, I love it
Love it, I love it, love it, I love it
That's why I love it, I love it
Love it, I love it, love it, I love it
That's why I love it, I love it
Love it, I love it, love it, I love it
(Igh!) Love it
Love it, I love it

[Verse 2: Chance the Rapper]
[?] (Igh!)
If I drop it they gonna cop it
I might start a non-for-profit, my poppa say, "Chancelor, I am so proud of you"
Like my beats? They made all of them, kick my feet on the ottoman
I just might run for Alderman, you got power too
Sneak that rap, put a message in, it's that sugary medicine
Feel like the intro, but better than it's ever been (Igh!)
Jumping like checkers, clever like chess is
Smoking like purp is, perfect like Surf is, deeper than surface
Anxious and nervous, the world isn't flat, it's sharp as a circus
It's starving like sharks is that's looking for surfers
I'm not in the industry, not in the service, not into retail
Not into nodding my noggin, neglecting the detail
I'm only beginning, behold magnificence
Brown-skinned black boy when his dread-head friends tall and omnipotent
You choke like cinnamon, you broke, I been the man
Triiibe, SM and 197 at your fuckin' neck, boy (Igh!)

[Chorus 2: Towkio & Eryn Allen Kane (Chance the Rapper)]
Woah—woah—woah (Igh! Igh! Igh!)
Where the end will go?
Will I ever know? Heaven only knows
Heaven only knows
Woah—woah—woah
Where the end will go?
Will I ever know? Heaven only knows
Heaven only knows
Woah—woah—woah
Where the end will go? (Igh! Igh! Igh! Igh!)
Will I ever know? Heaven only knows
Heaven only knows (Heaven only knows)
Woah—woah—woah
Where the end will go? (Igh! Igh! Igh!)
Will I ever know? Heaven only knows
Heaven only knows
(Igh!) (Woo!)

[Outro: Chance the Rapper]
Ayy, why you about to have the hottest tape of 2015? It's stupid
This song is already so hot, I'm actually just glad you let me rap on that bitch
