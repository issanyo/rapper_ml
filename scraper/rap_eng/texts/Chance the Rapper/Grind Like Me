[Intro: Caleb James]
Coach K, what up big dog?
Kobe, Juice

[Verse 1: Caleb James]
Boy you fucking with that peg money bank mob
Keep on flashing all that money get your bank robbed
I'm sitting on 24's, new paint job
I call your baby mama up and get a crank job
Your bitch bad man I'm talking Kim Porter fine
And she bust it wide open like a Jordan sign
I'm steady posted up with my nigga [?]
We getting so much bread the feds think we serving 8-balls
If a nigga out of line, put him in his place
If a nigga talking shit, sock him in his face
See me in the club wilding and I'm going hard
Two fingers in the air, SaveMoney Squad
Blowing on them trees, bad bitch double D's
Niggas popping triple C's and we saving all the fees
I got pimps, I got gimps, in the booth I'm the truth
Take a couple shots of Henny, know that get a nigga loose

[Hook: Chance the Rapper and Caleb James]
These niggas out here working, these niggas out here chilling
She twerking for a living, and working is a killing
And a dime up in my pocket, got hundreds in my ceiling
That stunner shit is dead, cause savior man [?]
Cause ain't nobody grinding hard like me x5

[Verse 2: Tris J]
Tris mane gonna get 'em, keep a box of toothpicks with him
I put 30 on your mama, couple big ones on my woman
Going harder than your denim, Caleb got me grilling
We be doing what they hate doing, better known as women
Honies want to freak me, man I swear I love it
I just him 'em on site, swear they never see my covers
Tris mane got 'em by the dozen, ask your second cousin
She say, "fuck you talking bout?"
He keep it cracking, popping bubbly
So y'all better watch y'all girls, one of y'all in pearls
Boy I get ahold of them hoes, got 'em wetter than y'all girls
This one off, Savemoney in the clique
LA swag, blowing cookie in the whip

[Hook: Chance the Rapper and Caleb James]

[Verse 3: Brian Fresco]
Super stupid stupid fruity ooey gooey loud
I be moving, truly cruising, bitches grooving in the crowd
Think your booming? Man my niggas we be serving by the pound
George Gervin with the loud, finger flip the bird with style
Ugh these niggas ain't counting no chips, ain't got no bricks
On my soul, you fuck niggas ain't really on shit, got niggas with clips
That's on my soul, my home, my home
Said I put that on my mind, my dome
Motherfuckers can't grind like me
I'm in my zone, on my own, me and Caleb on patron
Finna cop a redbone so the team can get blown
I be gone, bitches all in my phone
Talking 'bout this land I own
On my slow, niggas run Chicago
