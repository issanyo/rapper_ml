[Verse 1: Chance The Rapper]
Uh, uh, uh
Take a break when I break my leg
Save the day when I take her hand
Ohh
Take a break when I break my leg
Save the day when I take her hand
And she break my heart
And she take an arm and leg and a car and the kids
And the court's taking course on me
And of course I'm remorseful
But more so for the kids forced to use morse code
Poor souls ain't got no voices
Take a disco nap when disco's dead
And the word goes live and I fix those heads
And the disc goes flop but the track don't skip
And the words don't jumble and the milk don't curdle
And the cookie don't crumble
And the one eyed man screams
"Marco, this no joke, this code red", too late
The blind townspeople finally found people
Kingdom came, freedom rang
See what I'm sayin? Took his name
Who got that hook up on that Peter Pan?
The book is broke, he shook his hand
(Who got the hook-up on the...)

[Chorus: Ady Suleiman]
Tell me how you feel inside, tell me oh yeah, oh yeah
Tell me, tell me how you feel inside
Tell me how you feel, tell me
Tell me, tell me how you feel inside
Tell me how you feel inside, ma
Tell me, tell me how you feel tonight
Tell me how you feel
Tell me how you feel
Oh, oh, oh

[Verse 2: Erykah Badu]
Young man lay, lay your head down
Tell me of your day (day)
Rememory you'll say
Chancellor, baby, you're uneasy
I can tell
But in your way you're on your way
Rememory, you're safe
