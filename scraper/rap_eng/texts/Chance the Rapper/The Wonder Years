[Instrumental break]

[Hook: Maceo]
When I was a snot-nose, my Papa told me
"All you got is family, son, soon you’ll see
Always hold your Mama’s hand when you’re crossin’ that street"
What Papa told me

[Hook: Maceo]
When I was a snot-nose, my Papa told me
All you got is family,son, soon you’ll see
Always hold your Mama’s hand when you’re crossin’ that street
What Papa told me

[Verse 1: Maceo]
Big boys don’t cry
Catch you slippin, put a whoopin’ on that backside
Papa was a one to let you know where you stand
Looked you in the eye, Papa never lied
Back when I was younger, sat me on his knee
Said this the kind of man you gon' to grow to be
A man whose word is stone, always rights his wrongs
No matter what the trouble, you got to carry on

[Hook: Maceo]
When I was a snot-nose, my Papa told me
All you got is family,son, soon you’ll see
Always hold your Mama’s hand when you’re crossin’ that street
What Papa told me

[Hook: Maceo]
When I was a snot-nose, my Papa told me
All you got is family,son, soon you’ll see
Always hold your Mama’s hand when you’re crossin’ that street
What Papa told me

[Verse 2: Chance The Rapper]
(I remember what you told me, like)
Little Chancellor, pull your pants up
Stick and move son, keep your hands up
Somebody puts you down? Better stand up
Don’t wear no jewelry nigga, them shits is handcuffs
Don’t need no back talk, that mean don’t talk back
You going back for fall? You plan to fall back?
Naw? Cool, Jackson 5, sell CDs in packs of 5
Better rap your heart out rooster boy, cause them streets will eat your ass alive
Artist's darkest moments are the farthest from the barbecue
Father’s day in barber shops, fishing at the park with you
Act right when I’m not with you, still askin’ what I should do
Got to watch the throne, because it’s time to blow
But I got what I got, I got from you

[Hook: Maceo]
When I was a snot-nose, my Papa told me
All you got is family,son, soon you’ll see
Always hold your Mama’s hand when you’re crossin’ that street
What Papa told me

[Verse 3: Maceo]
Now that I’m a young man, the devil’s haunting me
He won’t let me sleep, I see him in my dreams
And every day I wake, my soul he tries to take
But Papa taught me stay the course and pray for better days
Nevermind what they say, be what you about
If you are who you say, no need to speak it clout
Papa’s love was strong when he held you in his arms
Could nothing ever break that bond

[Hook: Maceo]
When I was a snot-nose, my Papa told me
All you got is family,son, soon you’ll see
Always hold your Mama’s hand when you’re crossin’ that street
What Papa told me
