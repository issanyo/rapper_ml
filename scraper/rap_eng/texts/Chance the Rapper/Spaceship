[Intro]
Uhh baby (x2)

[Verse 1: Alex Wiley]
Blast off [uhh baby)
It's the motherfucking time now
Dug a deep ditch when i quit school, but this rapping shit helping me climb out
Me and Chancellor, fuck you tahm bout
Village shittin' on niggas in time out
When im feeling this all that i rhyme 'bout
Me and Kembe grindin' in the grind house
Asking where I wanna go, who I wanna be
My life is nothing more than ripping all these beats
And that's the way i want it im trippin'
Of the weed and that im sippin' on at least you
Tipping, fuck you mean
Gotta get mine, gotta fucking win
Gotta bring the Village, I gotta represent it
I gotta keep on pushing, gotta keep on working
I can't stop yelling fuck though, I gotta keep on shittin'

All we wanna do is get money
Seem like errbody want some shit from me
Like put me on with this and hook me on with that
Find your way up off my dick homie
Remember I used to keep the sacks with me
In the basement, watching that Rap City
Niggas used to say I rap shitty, funny
Now them niggas want a track with me

[Hook: Alex Wiley]
If my manager insults me again
I will be assaulting him
After I fuck the manager up
Then I'm going to shorten the register up
Let's go back, back to the Gap
Look at my check, wasn't no scratch
So if I stole, wasn't my fault
Yea I stole, never got caught
(x2)

[Interlude: GLC]
Yea, they're going to do it on purpose man
It's going to be haters lurking
You know what I'm talking about?
Wishing to see you fail
But at the end of the day if you got God on your side
Why the fuck would you believe in hell
You know what I'm talking about?
Hate ain't shit but the devil
Tell them motherfuckers to get up
And get up on a whole 'nother motherfucking level
Ism

[Verse 2: Chance The Rapper]
NASA,
Whole world wants to know what you crashed for,
Jag off, what you jag for
Im just doing what you assholes, had asked for
When we going to home?
My eyes hurt, my throat hurt, my soul hurt
My whole church know my niggas on dirt
Lil' college dropout, blame it on Ye'
Lil' Jimmy done grown up, he's slangin' them tapes
Southside, out West, South By Southwest
Doubt my prowess, I guess 'bout now I'm fresh
Goodness gracious,
Visionary chasing, Chance with a space and The
Then a pronoun, and the car spacious,
And a spaceship for the spaceship like IGH!

[Hook: Alex Wiley]
(2x)

[Outro: GLC]
Yea, always keep your ism at a magnificent level
That it's true, know what I'm talking about?
I come to find out there's three type of people in the world
There's those that ask what happened
There's those that saw it happen
And then there's those that made it happen
And which one are you?
Cathedral.ism
