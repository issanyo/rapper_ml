[Verse 1]
Yo! What's good for him?
Instrumentality's home, now we good again
And we flipping out like the end of my brim
Tryna get that good so I throwin' a fit
Getting it in, livin' and win, reminiscin'
We could give a fuck about tomorrow's begin
So we [?] til they think that we residents
Posted on walls like Facebook messages
No more "Beddy Bye" to the Chi
Pull up the covers, open blinds, rise and shine
Me getting it in is like Mike in his prime
Over a dance battle like it's Mike in his prime
O and 1-on-1 against Mike in his prime
See what I'm implying is I'm simply on my grind
And I'mma keep on shinin' til the sun don't shine
Oops I guess you thought that the sun don't shine
So what up Reese, what up John, what up Zoe?
What up Perry, what up Rach, what up Zoey?
Simone, and anyone else I call 'homie'
Anyone who's not you can blow me, so

[Hook]
Yea, yea we home again
You can see that we home again
Best believe that we home again
Instrumentality, yea we home again

[Verse 2]
Yo, lookin' back on my life
Coulda had a nigga stoned, lot like Lot's wife
Iâ€™m spraying rage these niggas master the limelight
They feelin' shocked like Ben Franklin's flying kite
I'm from a city where they steal from others
Where Cain made them able to kill my brothers
No lovin' in these seas, the opportunity chances
But Chance says, "Oz ain't got shit on Kansas"
I ain't from Brooklyn or Houstatlantavegas
My home is West [?] I used to roll me up bakers
Where me and Chris used to play X-Men for Sega
The home of the haters and the betrayers that'll snake ya
I never touch the skies, I never touch the stars
Never been to NASA, I fuckin' hate Mars
I'm as human as the come, I'm not rap's peace
But I put Chi on the map like Jean Baptiste
So give a round of applause, shoot a round to the stars
Gather around and give 'em pounds, cars
He stay with y'all through the lonely sit
My name is Chano J Bennett and I'm home again
Sing it

[Outro]
Yea, we home again
Yea, best believe that we home again
Yea, you can see that we home again
Yea, Instrumentality, yea we home again
Yea, you can see that we home again
Yea, best believe that we home again
Instrumentality, yea we home again
