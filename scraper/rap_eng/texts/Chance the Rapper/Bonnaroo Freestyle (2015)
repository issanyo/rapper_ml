[Intro: Kendrick Lamar]
Just wave ya hands like this
Make some noise
Now scream!

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
Nobody come after
Nobody compete, y'all weak
This is more than us, an athlete
This is rhymes on stage, this is a rage
This not a party, this is a parade
I pass it to my homeboy Chance
Give it to em with ya homeboy man

[Verse 2: Chance the Rapper]
Damn, I'm on the stage with Earth, Wind & Fire
Gotta spit fire, rapper for hire
Hangin' out with Kendrick Lamar, Chicago
Like y'all go to my shows, I feel like [?]
I be rappin' off the top, I know I'm a star
How I end at Bonnaroo, we ain't goin' too far
I got a Super Jam to bond with me, it feel like Chicago
This the place you wanna end up, Bonnaroo make some noise!

[Break: Kendrick Lamar (Chance the Rapper)]
Hey! Hey!
(Make music, hey!)
(Save music, hey!)

[Verse 3: Chance the Rapper]
Chance the Rapper, [?] turnt
'Fore I pass the rock when I rock with Surf
I'm feelin' like I could use a shirt
But if I got a couple words I could use a verb
Livin' in a big pen, it's big Chance
With my big pants, we rock Pimp A Butterfly
When I'm ridin' through I feel like I could [?]
I can never, never die, rappin' with my circle [?]
Feelin' like a samurai off the top of the tippy
I'm feelin' like I'm a hippy, I used to be super trippy
Now I'm feelin' music [?]
I be hangin' with my homie, that's how music go!

[Verse 4: Kendrick Lamar]
And that's the music flow
And if you with me right now, homie now ya know
I said we talkin' bout Surf, talkin' bout K Dot
Knowin' we rule the Earth, talkin' about hip-hop
Talkin' this non-stop, talkin' that real rock
Talkin' right from Chicago, L.A. the top
Make some mothafuckin' noise in this bitch
Cause you know I don't stop, this is great as it get!
