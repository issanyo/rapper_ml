[Verse 1: Chance the Rapper]
Chance, acid rapper, soccer, hacky sacker
Cocky khaki jacket jacker
Slap-happy faggot slapper
Iraqi rocket launcher
Shake that Laffy Taffy, jolly raunchy rapper
Bang, bang, bang - skeet, skeet, skeet
She do that thing for three retweets
The album feel like '92
Now take that ball 'fore he three-peat
Chance, ho, acid head, cruising on that LSD
Asked Joseph about my deal
He looked back said "hell yeah, let's eat!"
Young Rascal Flatts - Young ass kid ass could rap
Fuck all the assholes, asterisk back
I'm like a nazi not dead to be dad
Gratzi for all of the shots that we had
The shots that we had, i'm tryna take another fucking shot on the ave
Shoutsout the ave
Shouts to all my niggas from Chicago and Laramie
Let em hear it if they haven't hear of me they scared of me
Im outie IGH!

[Verse 2: Chance the Rapper]
I'm off the top like a confiscated hat
They took it back like we confiscating that
Can i get it, wait i'm skating back
Down the rail
Tell him if he's ever been to hell, holy grail
That all these niggas looking for
I ain't looking forward to a magazine
Or a cover of Forbes
I don't need to afford
A Ford car that I could ride through switch on the doors
Turn up the locks because niggas be trying to rob you
I don't really hear shit they trying to rock through
They trying to rock through the rock of gilbraltar
I had to take the shit to the alter
And alter my shit like control-alt-delete
I know i'm hot in the streets
And i'm hot with the tweets
And i'm hot with the heat
And i'm like the spurs vs the heat
First verse, worse than me
And everybody's wishing happy birthday
Like wheres the candles
And wheres that nigga chano?
And wheres that nigga that eats like campbells
Camp full of soup...

[Verse 3: Chance the Rapper]
You a lame and your bitch break down my weed sometimes
See my face in the streets, in the tweets if you read sun times
I be in the sun times if you read one time
I hit it then i hit one time
Every time i drop a hit and niggas like it
Everybody want to rap just like it
And i know that my rap just might fix the game
Shoutsout to swane shoutsout to swayne
Lahni, ripping of the top i got a trumpet, Donnie
Shoutsout that nigga Nico
I gotta meet those
Girls that be giving me pesos and euros and lethos
You understand it if you write a few papers
Off of the top i'm blowing vapors
Throw it to my homie with the light saber
Cut it up quickly, Ripley's believe me
I be getting off like this is my stop
Heheheh a nigga might stop
If i hit enough hot bars in a row
But if not, i just might give and go
Green light, i got T like a nigga that have a cup of tea right in front of em
I keep bumping em, damn they keep bumping em
Walking through the streets like man we can't bump with em
Having fun with em
Shoutsout sway
Shoutsout everybody in the room today
I'ma be back on the rap fix
And now i gotta act like... an actress
