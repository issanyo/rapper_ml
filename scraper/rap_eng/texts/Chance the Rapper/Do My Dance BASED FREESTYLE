[Intro: Chance the Rapper]
I'm just havin' fun with it
Thank you for... I just wanna say the fact that I'm talkin' to you right now means you're listening right now, so

[Verse 1: Chance the Rapper]
Shoutout you
Shoutout you
Do your dance
Do your dance
Shoutout you
Shoutout you
Do your dance
Do your dance
Look at you, look at me, look at you
Look at me, look at you
Look at me, look at you
Do my dance, do my dance
Look at me, look at you
Look at me, look at you
Look at me, look at you
Do my dance, do my dance, do my dance
I'm just Chance, I'm just sayin'
Just in case you didn't know you can't
Keep on doin' Xans
That shit's bad for you and I had to just go tell my fans
If you have a problem, problem once solved
It's me and Lil B, niggas can bust
But we just got a problem, problem with trust
And not the ones that hang lights like trust
That's a production joke
Comin' through, I don't fuck with you
Until we understand we untouchable
Then we can understand that it's a Lunchable
I mean it's sweet like for kids
No more beef, I forfeit
Fe Fi Fo I'm giant
Comin' through I'm client, I got a couple clients
And it keeps on rainin', the children keep on cuttin'
It's just me and Bassy, comin' through like Macy's
Came in after Martian fields and things been different lately
I got a different timing for everything that come in
I just gotta keep on waiting, I gotta take that, come in
Shit off the leash
On the leash, everything that I say
Skeet skeet, pullin' up in that Jeep, Jeep
Beep beep, pull off in a creep, creep
You know Jeepers creep
You know speakers speak
So after I'm spoken for I dip off like I'm leavin' me

[Interlude: Chance the Rapper + Lil B]
Aye can I just introduce my mans real quick?
What's up brother?
Most mixtapes ever listened to in the world
Preciate it
Most positive, most you know what I'm sayin
Most loving, most caring
I really appreciate it
Most eclectic, most intellectual artist
Lil B!!
What's up Chance man?
I got big love for you, man, one of the best artists ever
Hottest artist out right now
I'ma tell you man, I appreciate everything you do
If you wasn't a legend I wouldn't even be rockin' with you
You already a legend

[Verse 2: Lil B]
You already the god of the booth
It's Lil B, man, I swear to God I'm the truth
I be rockin' off top for real
Sittin' back in the field, my back be hurtin'
Workin' so hard my back was jerkin'
I have to get surgery cause my shit wasn't workin'
But now I'm back from the dead
Makin' this music, man it's all in my head
It's all for the love, it's all from above
Man I swear I love my thugs
I got love for the homies
I hug the homie
And I tell him that I love him
But I still fuck their bitches
Real talk, man you know man we comin' vicious
I got the word and I got some verbs
I might say some nouns but that's not the words
That I really care about, this is what I care about
People, love, get that shit out the house
Because we already know about it
All that drugs and shit, we already know about it
Broken families and shit, we already know about it
You just tryna hear the world but y'all don't know about it
We makin' this shit
Lil B, Chance, this is our shit

[Outro: Lil B]
Everybody that was a part of this, I love y'all
Like Chance said, if you listen to this, you're already special right there
What this is is history and so in the world you can do whatever you wanna do, just be yourself
Keep that love in your heart
And follow your own heart
Respect people, respect everybody
But follow your own heart
You gon' make it
Follow your heart
You know what I'm sayin'?
Shoutout to everybody that do what they gotta do
We all learnin' what's the best route
Some eat meat, some are vegan
Some drink juice, some drink water
But at the end of the day we're all gonna go to the same place
Let's live this life the best that we can
Have the best of times
Give thanks to everybody
Give thanks to the highest
Cause we live within
You know what I'm sayin'
Nobody's perfect man, nobody's better than the next
But all we can do is be ourself, count these checks
And let that be last
When you're real the money just come
You don't even have to worry about it
Like I said man like Chance the Rapper
It's your boy Lil B, it's my last chance
It's our last chance
BASED FREESTYLE MIXTAPE
We can't wait no more
I can't wait no more
