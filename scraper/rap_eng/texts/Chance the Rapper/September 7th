[Verse 1: Chance The Rapper]
*Yawning*

Damn it's the 7th already?
Only 6 in the morning getting up already
The sun ain't even up, my eyelids too heavy
The breath smells of vodka and fingers smells of reggie
Hair is all nappy and clothes is all fresh
The assorted is torture for all the lucky freshies
Back to proms, and after-school lock ins
I need more [?] of this going back to school coppin'
Shoppin' to mom, she knows that I am Savemoney
Tryna convince her that this time I really save money
Buying both our clothes with stain money
Tryna explain that it's all just the same money
But she knows it's really gang money
I said momma what's the difference if it make money?
She says if you'll take for me you would take from me
And as long as I pay for it she will pray for me

My homie, Nico Segal of Kids These Days band
Savemoney

[Trumpet solo: Nico Segal]

[Outro: Chance The Rapper]
Watch out, it's a movement
Look for that, Savemoney you'll see us in the papers
On the news
Look for GPA, Instrumentality
Back to school!
