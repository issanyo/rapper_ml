[Intro]
Yes - Finally a song for these hatin' motherfuckers in Chicago
GOD DAMN (Yeah)
I don't even know what to say. Listen

[Chance the Rapper]
Haters, say your prayers
Father Pfleger got a good book full of paper
Ayer
But these niggas at the studio
Love me like a groupie, yo
And then they sting like a [?], yo
Steal my lines and repeat freestyles
Look up [?] tunes then delete these files
"Ayo, Chano. What's good with the remix?"
"Beddie Bye was decent, best of the recent."
"Love that new song, swear it was decent."
"Fuck Chano. I swear that nigga make me sick"
Walk in the stu, cute girl in his hands
Imma beat his ass when I get the chance
Knock his little ass out them skinny pants
[?] give em pounds then I wash my hands

[Split-P]
Why the fuck they biting rhymes?
Back to the future, stuck in time
Line after line, they bite my rhymes
And they never get noticed cause I never got time
[?] writing lines
Won't you go go sniff a line?
Cause I'm too too far ahead
And you too too far behind
Money ain't the topic cause the haters on this song
Talking in the background, wanting me to sing along
So I grab my protection, better get protection
Cause if you bite my 16, then it's Lethal Weapon
I know that left you guessing like
"Wait wait wait one second."
"What this guy talking when he say lethal weapons?"
[?] stop hatin, or I would just be wreckin'
Any MC that I'm kickin' like Tekken
