[Verse: Chance The Rapper]
Whether its reed or is ligature
I literally read the sheet like it’s literature
I’m from the miniscule the miniature
I don’t understand whatever this or that means
Means my skills is limited
But y’all ain’t hurting me I swear that I’m Hercules
Mixed with a bit of Freddie Mercury
Mixed with a little Kanye and a little MJ
Hella Ken Bennett and a little mommay
And I’m still that kid teachers thought that wouldn’t make it
I’m still that oreo that y’all niggas wouldn’t play with
I’m still that friend you said that wasn’t your friend
When they laughed and teased asking “why you hang out with him?”
And I’m still Ms. [Macs?] pet peeve
With words above yours that you would not believe
And I’m still [Ms. Nasner?] and a little McHenry
All of them must think I’m still the only memory
So let me get at them though
Let me spit at them cause
If I spit at ‘em I just might split atom
And since the apple that Adam bit
I have been so adamant
Y’all are acting just average and adequate and inatimate
And my first song was for Jayden
Prayin' he’d stay alive and now he’s playing in the playpen
And I know I’m hella good with my cousin in my face
And since I’m hella good then I know I’m in my place
And if I’m hella good then I know I’m in my place
And if I’m hella good then I know I’m in my place
