[Chorus]
We don't do the same drugs no more
We don't do the, we don't do the same drugs
Do the same drugs no more
'Cause she don't do the same drugs no more
We don't do the, we don't do the same drugs
Do the same drugs no more

[Verse 1]
When did you change?
Wendy, you aged
I thought you'd never grow up
I thought you'd never
Window closed
Wendy got old
I was too late, I was too late
A shadow of what I once was

[Chorus]
'Cause we don't do the same drugs no more
We don't do the, we don't do the same drugs
Do the same drugs no more
'Cause she don't laugh the same way no more
We don't do the, we don't do the same drugs
Do the same drugs no more

[Verse 2]
Where did you go?
Why would you stay?
You must have lost your marbles
You always were so forgetful
In a hurry, don't wait up
I was too late, I was too late
A shadow of what I once was

[Bridge]
'Cause we don't, we don't do what we say we're gonna
You, always perfect, and I was only practice
Don't you miss the days, stranger
Don't you miss the days?
Don't you miss the danger?

[Chorus]
We don't do the same drugs no more
We don't do the, we don't do the same drugs
Do the same drugs no more
'Cause she don't do the same drugs no more
We don't do the, we don't do the same drugs
Do the same drugs no more
