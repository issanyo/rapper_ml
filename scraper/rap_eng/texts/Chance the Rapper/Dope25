Verse 1 (Lil Arliss)

Odd Future loop-de-loop around the fuckin' table
Shocked my ass so hard that now I am unstable
No DirecTV, just cable
Methlymine Breaking Bad inkin'
Always fucking cryin' just like Jesse Pinkman
Let's go get shot like fuckin' Lincoln
Free state, no blizzard
Jumpin' like a galloping lizard
Go to Walmart, get some sneakers
Play Quidditch and be the beater
Hangin' round tight in my wife beater
I don't want a knife, just a hive eater
My net ain't no fuckin' cord
Pull out the cards and break a chair over your head like WWE no holds barred
Hop in my car, skrt off like Kodak Black
Tie you up then I'll throw you in black
Maybe even in the trunk
Some say that I'm drunk
No, I'm just a fuckin' psychopath


Verse 2 (Eugenetanktop)

Always called a bitch, rather retarded
Now she wish I was fucking deported
But now I called her disabled
Brother independent
Made a pregnant woman
The flight attendant pulling off like United
But I guess I'm now divided
So nigga I'ma go in ace on my neck
So I packed the nine, the tech
Now this stupid bitch fuckin' wrecked
Never come up like a bitch on her neck
Make the shit, end it
Never mind that
I'm goin' back
Gonna fuckin' pack
