[Intro]
Na nana na na na na nana
(And what they say?)
Just bounce to it
(And what they say?
What they say?!?)

[Hook]
And they say
Nanananana nananananana (Huh!)
Nanana nanana na na na
Na nana na nanana nana (Igh! Igh!)
Nanana nanana na na na (Huh!)

[Verse 1]
I know the words (Igh! Igh! Igh!)
I know the words, haven't you heard?
New album alert, shit's loud as the purp
I'm out in the burghs
Out in the streets, we was out on the curb
From out of the dirt a mountain of merch
I woke up with [?]
It's alright
I wept, I prayed on it, I slept on it, wait on it
Just flame up the Tunechi and know that you Gucci
Just something to say on it
Smoke like a sailor, curse like a chimney
My pops in the mirror, Mufasa is in me
I ain't no goofy (I ain't no goofy!) I ain't no goofy
I am the re-up, I am the plug, you can introduce me
This ain't no movie, I don't need jewelry, I don't need groupies
I need my money, I need my money, I am the movement

[Hook]
And they say
Nanananana nananananana (Huh! Huh!)
Nanana nanana na na na
Na nana na nanana nana (Igh! Igh!)
Nanana nanana na na na

[Verse 2]
Man I ain't no lame (Huh!)
I know the game, I know my daddy
You can tell when I speak, I got his name
I'm on my business (I'm on my business!)
Not in the business, I'm not a prisoner, I got my soul (I got my soul!)
I flaunt it, I wear it, I'm still a Christian, I still got hittas (I still got hittas)
Reesey and Justin a phone call away (That's right)
They say don't delay, and andale, they on the way (Igh!)
Catch me in my city on the daily with the kiddies givin' tours to the tourists (Mhmm)
Givin' our city to the kids, like givin' flowers to the florist
Pay the little skirt with the torn stitch, [?] with a pot of gold tourist
Grab a couple bucks, take some more with ya
You ain't know Open Mic's open doors, did ya?
I ain't no stain, I am for free
I am a promise, capital "P"

[Hook]
And they say
Nanananana nananananana
Nanana nanana na na na
Na nana na nanana nana
Nanana nanana na na na
And they say
Nanananana nananananana
Nanana nanana na na na
Na nana na nanana nana
Nanana nanana na na na
