[Intro: Chance The Rapper]
What's Gucci? It's Chance and it's Sulai
Oh no, hope the fans don't sue me

[Verse 1: Sulaiman]
One false move, that's your ass Mr. Postman
Off top, bald crop, soft spot, Rogaine?
Whip cream? No thanks
No brain, so lame
Rather rub my stick than settle for an old flame
Gold chain, gold ring, somethin' from a old king
New addition, cold things
I see you rockin' Pro Wings
Kind of awesome knowing that it's always snowin' over there
Only promise baby is that I promise I won't overbear
Cause I don't want a Kobe care, I don't want a Tiger trap
Is it worth me buyin' that? I'm thinking when I'm eyein' that
I'm flyin' and she fine but do I really want a flyin' rat?
I was gone off the shrooms
With my lil nigga father figure standing in the room
Watch him as he blossom like he came from a cocoon
Know the tune got the boom cause it came from Nez and Rio
Do it any weather nigga caliente frio for the people

[Hook: Chance The Rapper]
What's Gucci? It's Chance and its Sulai
In the Land shaking hands with the fam and the foolies
Oh no, hope the fans don't sue me
I made a couple grand now my pants don't suit me

[Verse 2: Chance The Rapper]
I found maggots on my salad, on the check that's on the tablet
On the hands of a waitress whose a fat chick on the Atkins
Who just happens to be actin' like I owe her any scratch and that
Food wasn't even crackin' so I'm dippin' at the back
I'm out that jam, up out that jam, up out that jam, up out that jam, boy
I heard you going HAM boy, I heard you got some fans boy
What happened to that Chan boy? He used to going ham-mor
You young don't end up Earl then end up missin' down in Samoa
He got talent, and got talent, and got Marcus and got dad
And got suspended in the challenge, Andrew Barber and then Fallon
And then Leno and then Helen, you just smokin' for the feelin'
And the high when you unbalanced don't that shit just feel like heaven?
So fuck with lil nitty, I'm boost I'm kitty
Hoes is just thirsty, my juice just too hittin'
Damn that, you finessin'
Boy you two sips in
And burn two more doobs for my niggas that's missin', RIP
