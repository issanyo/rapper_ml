[Intro: Wasted Potency]
I'm just gonna stay at home and dab
I'm just gonna stay at home and dab

[Verse 1: Wasted Potency]
Here's a little story it was back in ninety-four see
I was born into a world before me
So many have walked
So many have stepped
So what makes you think you could ever be the best (uh)
Private school let me go kept denying the faith
It wouldn't be the last time I was told to my face
It'd be nice if you weren't around
See everyone is up and you just bringing them down
So I was asked to leave
For asking questions
If there was a god
Would he allow our brethren
To suffer so much
There's so much oppression
This shit is shit
Well this shit is depression
It'd be better if I wasn't around
Y'all tryna turn up and I'm turning it down
It'd be nice if everyone stayed around
Yeah, it'd be nice if all y'all stayed around

[Chorus]
I'm just gonna stay at home and dab
I'm just gonna stay at home and dab
I'm just gonna stay at home and dab
I'm just gonna stay at home and dab

[Verse 2: Wasted Potency]
My homies doing heroin in the back seat
Of the 09 Hyundai Sonata
Everyday I ask myself yo dog
What you doing here why even bother
Though I found God in the acid blotters
Then I laid back said 3 our fathers
Put on some throwback, bumpin' Tha Carter
Went to a school that said "I was smarter"
Flunked out college now who was the smart one
Y'all smoking blunts I don't even wanna spark one
Shit don't get me high, I'm not bout to lie
But I need to hit a dab that's at least .5
Now everyone thinks
That I don't want to smoke
Put the potent shit be wasted I don't laugh at any jokes
I don't even feel a thing, on the largest fucking dose
Think everyone's a joke
Yeah everyone's a joke

[Bridge: Chance The Rapper Sample]
Kicked off my shoes, tripped acid in the rain
Wore my jacket as a cape, and my umbrella as a cane
The richest man rocks the snatch-less necklace
Spineless bitches in backless dresses
Wore my feelings on my sleeveless
My weed seedless, my trees leafless
I miss my diagonal grilled cheeses
And back when Mike Jackson was still Jesus
(I'm gonna stay at home and dab)

[Verse 3: Wasted Potency]
But then again
I'm nowhere near my idols
If he don't know he killed himself
Is he still suicidal
Ride the wave up like a Tidal
Does Yeezus have disciples?
I be looking for my title
My drugs a little tribal
I'ma hang around a while
On a noose made of denial
With a crocodile smile
If it's really about survival
I'm going downward in a spiral
I do a back-flip for some style
I hope this songs insightful
I hope its found
By some people in this world who might want me around
Let me turn it up and y'all turn it round
And listen to my verbs and bounce it to these nouns
Lets turn around and lets break it down
I got some people in this world who might want me around
I'm the last rapper who might be profound
So I'ma turn it up and y'all turn it down

[Chorus]
I'm just gonna stay at home and dab
I'm just gonna stay at home and dab
I'm just gonna stay at home and dab
I'm just gonna stay at home and dab
