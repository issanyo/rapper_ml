Part 1

[Intro: Ady Suleiman]
What comes up must come down
Must come down yea, must come down
What comes up must come down
Must come down

[Verse 1: Chance The Rapper]
Wave my gun in the air like white flag
Draw your rifles like stick figures, quickly
No details, no recoil, no regrets
Raise my hand like, raise my daughter, slowly
Don't know the answer but I know the ending
Never no after they only live happily

[Chorus: Chance The Rapper & ?]
What comes up, must gon' come down
Must gon' come down too
Must come down, must gon' come down
Must gon' come down, must gon' come down too

[Verse 2: Chance The Rapper]
Praise my heir like I'm scared to death, really
No need be, no easy, we proud of go, but come back
Raise my brother like, how did father holy?
Don't know the answer but I know the ending
Never no after they only live happily

[Chorus: Chance The Rapper & ?]
What comes up, must gon' come down
Must gon' come down too
Must come down, must gon' come down
Must gon' come down, must gon' come down too

[Outro: ?]
Must gon' come down, must gon' come down
Must gon' come down, must gon' come down
Must gon' come down, must gon' come down too
Must gon' come down, must gon' come down
Must gon' come down, must gon' come too
Must gon' come down, must gon' come too

Sometimes I get it right, sometimes I get it on the second time
Sometimes I get it right, sometimes I get it on the second time
Sometimes I get it right, sometimes I get it on the second time
Sometimes I get it right, sometimes I get it on the second time
Sometimes I get it right, sometimes I get it on the second time
Sometimes I get it right, sometimes I get it on the second time
Sometimes I get it right, sometimes I get it on the second time
Sometimes I get it right, sometimes I get it on the second time
Sometimes I get it right, sometimes I get it on the second time
Sometimes I get it right, sometimes I get it on the second time
Sometimes I get it right, sometimes I get it on the second time
Sometimes I get it right, sometimes I get it on the second time
Sometimes I get it right, sometimes I get it on the second time

Sometimes I get it right, get it right
Sometimes I, sometimes I get it, I get it
Sometimes I get it right, get it right
Sometimes I, sometimes I get it, I get it
Sometimes I get it right, get it right
Sometimes I, sometimes I get it, I get it
Sometimes I get it right, get it right

Part 3

[Intro: Chance The Rapper]
Wake me up, I need me a pick me up
She said, "Pick me up
I need you to wake me up"

[Verse: Chance The Rapper]
I don't wanna go out tonight, wanna sit on the couch tonight
Blow loud in the house tonight, It's too cold on that balcony
The bed too soft and the drinks don't cost
And the DJ cold and the line is short
The girl I want is the girl I got
And she pay for the drinks with the child support
The time is right when the Sprite gets dark
And the lights get low, when's this truth come off, come off
On tour, hoes think that you on but it's just one off
Uhm, uhm, wanna hit them sheets and I just might sleep
Cause I'm just so stressed, you should just undress
If I get impressed then you just might see why I need some rest

[Outro: Chance The Rapper]
She said me, "Wake her up"
Pick me up, I need me a pick me up (igh!)

Part 5

[Speech: Chance The Rapper]
Today I wanna tell you a story, a story of a great man
Today I tell you of glory, the glory of a great man
Now you might think that you heard this one, and you heard it once
But it's the first time you'll ever hear this, of a great man, of a great man, of a great man
This the first time of a great man, great man
First time
Today I wanna tell you of glory, glory of a great
Now you might think that you heard this one, heard it once
Now you might think that you heard this one, heard it once
