[Verse 1: Lorine Chia]
I've been livin' in vain
What can I say?
Just to make it go away
And to take away the pain
I've been crying to much
Wasting my time (wasting my time)
Oh, shedding all these tears
Instead of taking what is mine
I've been asking God, "Why?" (why)
Why am I here?
What am I to do?
While I'm only filled with fear

[Hook]
Time and time again I'm gone
Who would know it'd last this long?
Time and time again I'm gone
Who would know it'd last this long?

[Verse 2: Chance the Rapper]
Skip, skip, skip class, whip-less, with pass
Whiplash, deadbeats, skipped out, skipped dads
Dipped fast... me too
Little nigga, real big agenda
Teachers just holding me up
It's in my genes, suspenders (Ohh-Kay)
Livin' life on a ledge, peakin' over the edge
Thinkin' bout fallin' while dreamin' bout flyin'
No Se
When I'm gone get that bread
How long I could hold my breath
Been schemin' about ballin' while starvin' and dyin'
You think I'm reckless
Just because I'm with the shits
Just because I quit the class
And I still can't quit the cigs
I know it's hard to think
That's why you niggas want to sing too
That song look just like my shit, dawg
Come on, I used to have stains too
I used to lick lames too
I'm a lot more worried about flights now
Keepin' lawyers paid right now
Gettin' rights to the shit that I write down
Keep your head up son
It's either a migraine or an aneurysm
These catchy anecdotes, analyzing adolescent adaptation of good mannerisms
IGH!

[Verse 3: Lorine Chia]
What can I say?
Just to make it go away
And to take away the pain
I've been crying to much
Wasting my time (wasting my time)
Oh, shedding all these tears
Instead of taking what is mine
I've been asking God, "Why?" (why)
Why am I here?
What am I to do?
While I'm only filled of fear
