[Verse 1: Peter Cottontale]
You're my favorite song
Your melody's so strong
When I think of you
You're a dream come true
What I'm trying to say
Is that I'll always
I'll always love you
Ohhh

[Verse 2: Peter Cottontale & (Rex Orange County)]
You're my sing-a-long
You're the only song on my iPod
You're the only CD I keep in the whip (the whip)
You're my number one song on every playlist (playlist)

[Chorus: Peter Cottontale & Chance the Rapper]
What I'm trying to say
That I'll (that I'll)
Always (always)
Always love you
Breaking love is not like breaking up
It takes some making love
It takes some waking up early and making bacon
It takes scripture chasing seeing Nathan
When you've both been saving up
Patience, perseverance
Waiting, dating
Taking blatant disrespect from groupies
Goofies hating
Hear my love jack
Hand on my heart jack
Hand me my shotMy shit is so conditional yeah y'all
Fall out every time the caller drop
Y'all might need a better otterbox
Breaking love is not like breaking up
Cause ain't no breaking love
It ain't no faking love
It's give and take in love
Man it won't break us, made of faith and Savior's blood
Babe we ain't breaking up

[Chorus: Rex Orange County, Daniel Caesar & Yebba]
What I'm trying to say
(What you wanna say, what you wanna say)
That I'll always
I'll always love you
(Forever) Forever

(Forever and always) Forever
(Forever) Forever yeah
(Forever and always, forever and always)
Forever, forever (And always, and always, forever and always)
(Forever)
Forever (Forever)
(Forever and always)
(Forever, forever)
(Forever, forever) Forever, ever
(Forever and always)
Till I go down, my descent, ooh
