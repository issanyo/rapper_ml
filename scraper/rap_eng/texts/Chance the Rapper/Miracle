[Intro: Raury]
If it’s a miracle, to be alive and well
If we fell, we feel we’d be okay
If it’s a miracle, to be alive and well
If we fell, we feel we’d be okay

Okay, okay, okay...

[Verse: Chance The Rapper]
Sit with the beat
The chair isn't fair with you sitting right there
With your hair in a knot
Not a care in the world or a pot for the piss
Which we share cause a pair costs a lot
Not a pear in the world that the world wouldn't miss much as this
And if it isn’t the same then it’s apples and lemonade
Can’t stand for a Minute Maid man with an iPod
If I got locked up would you see me at the end of my sentence?
White dot, buy pot with what I got
Which I got from, fuck, still ain’t did shit with the beat
The stair isn’t there when your feet needed therapy
And their approval, a shoulder to lean on
From when it gets shivering cold with the heat on
In a trance with the beat gone
Realising that you should never speak on things done
People keep it a secret and keep goin’
Ain’t no reason to keep on thinkin’
There’s something deeper there’s China up under my garden
Tryna break bread stop beggin’ my pardon
My lead is astray, let’s get an apartment
With a dog and a song that I wrote you this morning
Uh!

[Chorus]
If it’s a miracle, to be alive and well
It's a miracle (It's a miracle, it's a miracle)
If it's a miracle, to be alive and well

[Bridge]
Snow is melting, water's pouring
Signal's turning, it's a miracle
Homies breathing, families eating
Mama singing, is a miracle
Snow is melting, water's pouring
Signal's turning, it's a miracle

[Outro]
If it's a miracle
Mama singing, it's a miracle
Snow is melting, the water's pouring
The signal's turning, it's a miracle
The homies breathing, the families eating
Mama singing, it's a miracle
Snow is melting, water's pouring
Signal's turning, it's a miracle
The homies breathing, the families eating
Mama singing, it's a miracle
