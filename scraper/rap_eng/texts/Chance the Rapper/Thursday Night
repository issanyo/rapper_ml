Hands out for the curl haired sons of Abraham
He brought his fathers out away from
If they ever get caught let's hope they shake that jam
If they ever get caught let's hope they shake that jam shake that jam x2

Chance the Rapper, song-singer, senior bong-steamer
Light up hot wheels, locked up wrong steamer
Dreamer, long beamers, our neighbors there lawns greener
We wrestle with envy then act up John Cena
Chancellor bennett referred to as word chemist
The bourbon and slurred sentences turn and i burn bridges
Cigarettes stained smile, all covered in sin
My big homie died, youngest turned older then him
Get night up with the bad bitches up
Get knocked up off a nigga bad luck
Gettin scared now
All that tax money I didn't add up
That I didn't get yet
They think that I got it
He got the long shirt so they think that I got it
Hell yeah it's preach speaking with all ya niggas
I seen all the tweets and that from your niggas
Y'all niggas got pack from the niggas
Oh yeah and uh, I bet it comes out in a month
Like 3001, ah!

(Chorus)
I count my blessings all day, my best friends on one hand
I count my blessings all day, my best friends on one  hand
My sheep when I'm done here x2
