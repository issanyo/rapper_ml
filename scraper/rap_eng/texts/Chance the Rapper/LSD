[Verse 1: Jamila Woods]
A body of water inside me
Reminds me of oceans, though I've never known one
I'm born by a cold one
It's only a small one compared
To the coast, I prefer it to most
I like water that don't burn my eyes when they open
I won't let you criticize
My city like my skin, it's so pretty
If you don't like it, just leave it alone

[Pre-Hook: Jamila Woods]
You gotta love me like I love the lake
You wanna love me, better love the lake
You gotta love me like I love the lake
You wanna love me, better love the lake
You didn't think I really had it like that
You ain't think we really had it like that
You didn't think I really had it like that
Matter fact, we can swim in it
I know you wanna get in it

[Hook: Jamila Woods]
Get on the highway, highway, baby
Look at it my way, my way, baby
See, we can fly away, fly away, baby
And we don't ever leave the ground
No, no, no
No, no, no, no, no, no, no

Rest In Peace Bernie Mac

[Verse 2: Chance The Rapper]
This here ain't for no Vice doc
This here ain't for no Spike op
But since I was one like a cyclops
I run up some stairs on a bike cop
I shake up some hands on the right block
Block club president, night watch
My niggas was real when the mic dropped
I put 'em in my wheel like a bike lock
Got family in Gary and STL, I got cousins in Milwaukee
I got family in Detroit and ATL, I got an auntie that steal our weed
We the number one gentrified
Run inside, gimme my land, the new Chi tits' perky
Face lift and makeshift spaces
Invest the rest in a number 25 Knicks jersey
Grass is greener in Pasadena or Catalina by the water
Where the overlap between bullet holes and backpacks couldn't be farther
And I'm supposed to father my daughter?
She the princess in the dragon's lair
I'm a dragon slayer, I can't fly away
To some hideaway, I gotta find a way

[Hook: Jamila Woods]
Get on the highway, highway, baby
Look at it my way, my way, baby
See, we can fly away, fly away, baby
And we don't ever leave the ground
No, no, no
No, no, no, no, no, no, no

[Outro: Jamila Woods]
I will never leave you
I'm everything you made me
Even when you break me down
The water always saves me
I could never leave you
I'm only what you make me
Even though you break my heart
The water's gonna save me
