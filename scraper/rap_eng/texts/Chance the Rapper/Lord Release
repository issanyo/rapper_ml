[Intro: Joanna Newsom]

Will you call me, when you get there
And I miss your precious heart
And I miss your precious heart
And miss and miss and miss and miss and miss and miss your heart

Lord Release your precious heart (x2)

[Verse 1: Chance The Rapper]
And she wants me to get out of the drug game
She doesn't realize how much it causes me pain
I just want my son to grow up with a dad with him
My father couldn't love his kids
So he wanted to abandon them
I don't sell rocks just because I want to
I sell for my son and so that he don't have to
I know now when don't seem like no other ish (?)
But the money in my sock is my son's scholarship
She want me to work for less than it's supposed to be
She'd rather starve than to eat some drug groceries
I love my family to death but niggas weren't so close to me
And to get out on that corner every morning that takes the most of me
But lord you know now that I have the best intent

[Outro: Joanna Newsom]
And all those lonely nights down by the river
Brought me bread and water (water, in)
But though I tried so hard, my little darling
I couldn't keep the night from coming in
And all those lonely nights down by the river
Brought me bread and water by the kith and the kin
But though I tried so hard, my little darling
I couldn't keep the night from coming in
