[Intro]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
(Mm) Yeah, yeah
Yah (yah)

[Verse]
Lazy male
Complainin' 'bout how high school he could
But his ACL
Aye, [?]
You're my daddy, how
You just a uncle from ATL
You better take out that trash
Boy, get your big
Grown ass on
Old ass on
Broke ass drinkin' up all the milk
But can't do no laundry
EHarmony romance on
Watch your tone, folk
Talkin' to grown folk
Yeah, get that bass out your voice
You was soundin' like Tone Loc
Now watch how I move
Different chapters
Decision's mission
Visit pastors
Everybody finally can say it out loud
Your favorite rapper a Christian rapper
And I got faith in my fate
In my soul, in my tape
In the cape, in the drape
From out West to the lake
Then cover his face like a Bape
And I hate when I wait
Never come late
Tobacco back Rolls
To bus seat back rows
To black boy black Rolls
Black Rolls
Men grow just as surely as mountain's peak
And plateaus plateau, you know what I mean?
You just a grown ass kid
Who the fuck you think you is
The sun is only halfway up
You still ain't come out your crib
You just a grown ass boy
Get up out o' here with all that noise
You still ain't come out your crib
