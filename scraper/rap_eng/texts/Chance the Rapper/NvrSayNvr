[Verse]
They ask me "Why this album so dark?"
Gloomy, and full of crushed heart
I tell ya
Cause the last album was my life's failure
I'd sip gin and tell ya
Holdin' my genitalia
History's on Lil Wayne memorabilia
Joey said, I sounded like Weezy
Zoey said, it was gettin' hard to see me
When I'm voicin' the word of something that's beneath me
Me moving to DC did not decease me
So I should have kept breathing til my lungs quit breathing
And then once more as a piece of blasphemy
Cause my raps feed me
Jay, am I good enough now?
I put my best foot in the center of a crowd
Cause that's forward for me I vow
I pray for the haters that's hateful
And grateful every time I get pesos
Cause I can never be Pac
I can never be BIG
I can never be Jay
I can never be Jigg
I can never be Vic
Never be J. Rivers
I can only be Chano and I never say never
And I can never say...
