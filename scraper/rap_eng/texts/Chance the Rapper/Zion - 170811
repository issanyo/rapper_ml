[Verse 1: Chance The Rapper]
Me mama love me like she love her nappy head
She sing me fables when she used to wrap me dreads
She said me look like me grandpappy, now he's dead
He never met me but he loved me, yeah he did
He was a King before me ma became a Queen
They killed him dead because he tried to stop the war
Me mama loved me like the song that she sing
But I think she loved me just a little bit more

[Verse 2: Vic Mensa]
A little bit less, then a little bit more
Hourglass, sand's timeless through my trough
Let it wash me away, dive in a fifth of the Jay
Mo', sip it slow
Cold nights, warm days, days don't break, they fade away
Face my watch then face the J
Faking it takes my pain away
Be a fatality, kill my salary
Dream shattering, trunk rattling, drug dabbling
Dabble a dab on a battery
Energy, ?
When we gon' see this salary
Set a timebomb 'til I blow up out the Matrix and the Zion

[Trumpet Solo]
