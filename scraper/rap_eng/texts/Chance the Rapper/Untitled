[Intro]
Is it playing?
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Na, na, na, na, na (x5)
IGH!

[Verse 1: Chance The Rapper]
Kiss my ass in case you get this, get the kitchen supplies
Dishes, washers, wishing water was delicious as wine
Well aware of when and where and who nigga did the crime
Digits, smidgets, you know numbers tell the viciousest lies
Picture pigeons could fly, vision penguins with fins
Pitch a pilot to air soon, schooling fishes to swim
I can't fall for the offer, off of general p
Gentlemen, I'm a gentleman warning generally

[Hook: Chance The Rapper] x3
Justify your love
Justify the blood
Once you find your love
Don't get lost

[Verse 2: Mr. MFN eXquire]
A fortune cookie told me it's three routes
Self destruction and self actualization
The others just a quirky maze when you're driven insane by your imagination
That plain shit, same shit that always make your plane shift
From a higher plane to an off kilter course
An erroneous maze where you can't shift
Shit, ups, downs, [?] write strange [?] of the romantic thoughts
You caught your demons with the same lips
That you kiss your mama with, suck vaginas with
I was feeling honest, my honesty just a bunch of promises that I can't keep
Honestly I really love all y'all
But y'all make me feel like y'all hate me
Same conundrum Jesus faced, but I don't believe in that fairy tale
Reality's too real, how you look me in the face
And tell me that [?] that I can't feel
Shit, I really gave my soul to y'all, I believed in everything you said
I believe in everything you say, never really even fucking talk
And I toss and turn behind my bed
And I toss and turn inside my head
And I tossed my turn, switch one vice for the heist of another
I fucked thirty bitches when I would've got drunk
I told my niggas that I changed but, umm umm

[Hook]
