I've been riding around with my blunt on my lips
With the sun in my eyes and my gun on my hip
Paranoia on my mind, got my mind on the fritz
But a lot of niggas dying, so my 9 with the shits

Moved to the neighborhood, I bet they don't stay for good, watch
Somebody will steal daddy's rollie
And call it the neighborhood watch
Pray for a safer hood, when my paper good, watch
Captain save the hood, Hood Saviour
Baby boy, still getting ID'ed for swishers
Mama still wash my clothes
Still with the save money militia
I'ma still watch my bros
Trapped in the middle of the map
With a little bit of rock and little bit of rap
That with a literary knack and a little shitty Mac
And like literally jack

I've been riding around with my blunt on my lips
With the sun in my eyes and my gun on my hip
Paranoia on my mind, got my mind on the fritz
But a lot of niggas dying, so my 9 with the shits

They murking kids, they murder kids here
Why you think they don't talk about it?
They deserted us here
Where the fuck is Matt Lauer at?
Somebody get Katie Couric in here
Prolly scared all the refugees
Away like we had a fucking hurricane in here
And we shooting whether it's dark or not
I mean the day is pretty dark a lot
Down here it's easier to find a gun
Than it is to find a fucking parking spot
No love for the opposition
Specifically a cop position
Cause they never been in our position
Getting violations for the nation, correlating, you dry snitching

I'm riding around with my blunt on my lips
With the sun in my eyes and my gun on my hip
Paranoia on my mind, got my mind on the fritz
But a lot of niggas dying, so my 9 with the streets

I know, you scared, you should ask us if we scared too
I know, you scared, me too
I know, you scared, you should ask us if we scared too
I know, you scared, me too

[Outro]
It just got warm out
It's the shit I've been worrying bout
I hope that it's storm in the morning
I hope that it's pouring out
I hate crowded beaches
I hate the sound of fireworks
And I ponder what's worse
Between knowing it's over and dying first
Cause everybody dies in the summer
Wanna say goodbye tell them while it's spring
I heard everybody dying in the summer
So pray to god for a little more spring
I know, you scared, you should ask us if we scared too
I know, you scared, me too
