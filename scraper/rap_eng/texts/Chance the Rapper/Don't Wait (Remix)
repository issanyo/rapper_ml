[Verse 1: Mapei]
A friend indeed, come build me up
Come shed your light, it makes me shine
You get the message, don't you ever forget it
Let's laugh and cry until we die

[Hook: Mapei]
If it wasn't for you I'd be alone
If it wasn't for you I'd be on my own
Don't wait 'til I do wrong
Don't wait 'til I put up a fight
You won my heart without a question
Don't wait for life

[Verse 2: Chance the Rapper]
IGH!
I'll hug you when I see you like you're leaving for a trip
I fuck you when I need to, I just need you for a bit
I've been fiending for a hit
Got my guards down in God's garden, Eve and Adam eatin' all of it
Before I left and I was leaving
Took a bite and it was sweeter than a bitch, now I'm bitter
I'm only back for funerals, we should throw a wedding
I'm only packing fewer clothes, I forgot forgetting
I just gave a fuck for nothing, got it. Good. Forgiven
I be getting got, but begotten sons is setting
And if I said it then I meant it, for a minute, least a moment
I could wait for Easter, just to know if it's a home
And if it is then I'm setting up shop
I appreciate your value, I just let it up stock
Do wait for love

[Hook: Mapei]
If it wasn't for you I'd be alone
If it wasn't for you I'd be on my own
Don't wait 'til I do wrong
Don't wait 'til I put up a fight
You won my heart without a question
Don't wait for life

[Verse 3: Maipei]
Not a thing in the world could get between what we share
No matter where you at, no worry I'll be there
No one's got your back like I do
Even when the business ain't going well, we still cool
When I shine, you shine, always on your side
All my life you'll have what's mine
Mark my word, we gon' be alright
My brother, my sister we gon' be just fine

[Hook: Maipei]
If it wasn't for you I'd be alone
If it wasn't for you I'd be on my own
Don't wait 'til I do wrong
Don't wait 'til I put up a fight
You won my heart without a question
Don't wait for life

[Outro]
Don't wait 'til I... (do wrong)
Don't wait 'til I... (put up a fight)
You won my heart
Without a question
Don't wait for life
