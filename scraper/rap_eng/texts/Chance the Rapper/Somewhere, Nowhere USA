[Intro]
I'm in the middle of nowhere, nowhere, nowhere
And I'm just looking for somewhere, somewhere, somewhere

[Verse 1: Chance the Rapper]
Yeah, you like that how I did my own echo
'Cause no one else could do me but me 'cause I'm the best though
I'm a bag of kush, you're bagged oregano
And I've been this way from the get-go, get low
Mistaking me for him is like Geico for Gekko
Won't ever replace me with money and some background techno
Anyway so I won't toy with kids just to let know
And all y'all still playing on the blocks needs to let go
Difference between us, lies and genetic make up
XY chronology, body mass make-up
At night I sleep, all night you stay up
You're afraid of nightmares, I'm afraid to wake up
And I tell my girl I love her every time I see her
'Cause I'm afraid tomorrow that I might not be here
'Cause sometimes my wrists whisper "slit us and we'll wisp you to the other side of wisdom"
Just jump off the tip of the world's tallest building
Fall on the tracks and claim that you tripped up
Or slipped up, popped pills claimed it was a mix-up
Oh, the box said 2 to 4? Could've swore that it read 24, damn Chance
You could've died if you popped anymore
Damn, just one more, could've let me go where
Maybe God intended for me to grow here
Damn Chano keep spacing off, I swear you so weird
You're afraid of somewhere, I'm content with nowhere

[Hook]
Somewhere, Nowhere USA
Ey, ey, ey, ey
Somewhere, Nowhere USA
Ey, ey
Somewhere

[Verse 2: Chance the Rapper]
You can go from somewhere to nowhere
By trolley from Maui to Mali
Mexican tamales on the border, I'm in line between crazy and depressed
Maybe I'm distressed 'cause my damsel's not undressed
And her knight in shining armor is searching for martyrdom
Like playing a game of operation with Parkinsons
You touch the walls and you felt shocked
'Cause when you touch the walls you felt boxed
Nowhere is vast, and somewhere's compressed
And my dreams need room to stretch out its legs
And nigga run around for miles, with its funny self
With even more stride than the gum itself
I feel my sanity is picking on my fantasies
And reality is pulling out the man in me
But drive, could give a shit about your asthma
Just kick you in the ass, and tell you to run faster
And some weeks can pass as I last seen my pastor
And let him tell me I don't get anything I ask for
God will give you wings when you stop being the bastard
I guess I'll go to nowhere
I don't need a passport

[Hook]
Somewhere, Nowhere USA
Ey, ey, ey, ey
Somewhere, Nowhere USA
Ey, ey, ey, ey
Somewhere, Nowhere USA
