[Intro: Joey Bada$$]
For all the thirsty sumchins out there
Beware
For like the 147th take

[Verse 1: Joey BADA$$]
Cause when I hit it, that pussy closed for sure like she rock that V card again
She said “Joey no, don’t ever hit me hard again"
It’s funny cause I recall, hitting the score
Play calling, told her hit the floor and she started dribbling balls
My game foreign, way outta line - shit make you forfeit
The score like four-zip flow like faucets grip up on that pussy like a forcep
Aight, I done lost it
So make ya decisions, I’m seeing my visions of double women
But I play my position, in the cut like incisions
This is why I’m not hot, I’m sizzling
And it’s drizzling hoes, flows, and dough, so
Foes gonna oppose, roll stupid O’s
You get worn out in these clothes, plus groupie hoes
Love the nino sucio lingo
They be like “You rap? Oh bingo”
I be like “No Inglo”
I only know the language of DeNiro - I never lie
They never seen a Black boy fly as high past the slash in the sky
Got a gash in my eye, bleeding out
Cause, when it was seeing out, was worth more than the amount
Of all of the accounts, in this world I proceed to count
But it’s just mine and
I can’t find no adjustment time sweet pumpkin pie
So just get in sumchin fly
And you gon’ be my sumchin for the night
I’m in town for the day I say it’s only right
She was a fan so
She left her man right where he stand yo had mad plans for joe
I demanded a blow, whether her name be Wendy or she shy
I just want a little Becky this is not a lie

[Hook: Joey Bada$$]
Wendy N Becky, Wendy N Becky
You so sexy but you can’t apex me
After you done licked my testes, don’t try to peck me
Please respect me, don’t test me
Wendy N Becky, Wendy N Becky
You so sexy but you can’t apex me
After you done licked my testes, don’t try to peck me
Please respect me, don’t test me

[Verse 2: Chance the Rapper]
We used to smoke nickels inside of Nichols Park
I paid the piper, the pickle she used to pick apart
Peppermint sticks in her middle, brittle, a little hard
Cringe when she grin like the Grinch, that bitch had a little heart
Neck covered in diamonds and hickies
Every time I fly in her city, she buying a titty
Or selling a kidney, or trying to get me
To believe she’s having a kid and that the kid has a mustache and raps pretty
Emoji right back like damn she funny
Thanking God for the shows, that’s that plan B money
Thinking God my mom’s can’t be grandmummy
Thanking God he ain’t never make a plan B for me
Choke holdin my wine glass, rock bottomin' out
Rock, paper, switchblade, rap got him a house
Pops got him a car, bops got him a couch
Girl got him arrested, girl got him up out

[Bridge]
Don’t even try to play yourself
I think you need to brace yourself
Don’t even try to play yourself
I think you need to brace yourself
Don’t even try to play yourself
I think you need to brace yourself
Don’t even try to play yourself
I think you need to brace yourself

[Outro]
Slow down
Slow your roll
Cool your jets
Moving way too fast
Slow down
Slow your roll
You a bop
Going ass bitch
Skeezer ass bitch
Lying ass, tricking ass bitch
Bitch, bitch
Slow your roll, bitch!
