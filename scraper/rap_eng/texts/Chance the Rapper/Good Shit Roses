Okay

Protect us from everything but not touch her she around
Whoopins and liquor it wasn't allowed
Held her down
Older we smokin' reefer right there outside the house

Gotta whole buncha bitches I don't need no names
Gotta whole buncha bitches I don't need no names
And I don't blame nobody's past
So I won't [?] your slutty ass
We get up, you need thirty need thirty ass
And I smoke right outta them holes they say "You dirty ass"
Videos they tell it all you seen that thirty [?]

Ridin' round
Imma write my will when I have time
Flow is Flow is barefeet on hot ground
When I grab you and stab you then afterwards laugh too
I'm devious
I don't even have human lungs
I got jail bars to replace them bruh
I just faced the blunt
Roses are where I'm not from
I bought my daughter one
She's the only hope I have
Glad to be a poster dad
Frozen
Livin that stiff life
Broke pitch wife
I'm the only one to get behind I might I can spit mics
Walk around niggas cribs avoiding heavy sticky traps
Chi-town scenery
A nigga been sick of this
(so what)
Trill niggas in a condo was built from just chillin with them niggas
Gonna need more than joy
And rollers to get far
(Cross)
Cross me you gon' get hit by a car

I just wanna hit that wow shit (this that good shit)
