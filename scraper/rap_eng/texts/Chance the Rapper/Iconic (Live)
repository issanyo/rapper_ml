[Intro: Madonna]
Are you with me?

[Intro: Mike Tyson]
I'm the best the world has ever seen.
(I'm the best ever!)
I'm somebody you'll never forget cause I work hard and sweat in my tears.
(Can't be stopped!)
I'm never falling again and if I did, I'd come back

(Yeah, Iconic, Iconic, Yeah)

[Verse 1: Madonna]
If you tried and failed, get up again
Destiny will choose you in the end
If you don't make the choice, and you don't use your voice
Someone else will speak for you instea
What you want is just within your reach
But you gotta practice what you preach
You pay with sweat and tears to overcome your fears
Never let the fire inside you leave

[Chorus: Madonna]
"I-can't", "icon" - two letters apart
One step away from being lost in the dark
Just shine your light like a beautiful star
Show the world who you are who you are
Yeah, there's another part of you no one sees
There's a burning fire that's underneath
Baby, don't you know you were meant to be
Born to be, meant to be

[Drop: Madonna]

Ironic

[Verse 2: Madonna]
Tell me I'm no good and I'll be great
Say I have to fight and I can't wait (yeah)
Standing in the wings, a butterfly that stings
I will rise above cause it's my fate (yeah)

[Chorus: Madonna]
"I-can't", "icon" - two letters apart
One step away from being lost in the dark
Just shine your light like a beautiful star
Show the world who you are who you are
Yeah, there's another part of you no one sees
There's a burning fire that's underneath
Baby, don't you know you were meant to be
Born to be, meant to be

[Drop: Madonna]

[Bridge: Madonna]
Born to be a superstar
That's exactly what you are
Born to be a superstar
That's exactly what you are

[Verse 3: Chance The Rapper]
Alright
Firefly change when they catch ya
Wanna put ya in their net for their light glow
Yellow brick highway
Paparazzi piled up on the high road
They just turned the sun into an idol
They just wanna see how high the sky go
Just to find how it feel to fall back
Madonna said I remind her of Michael
Steady blowing up my head, blowing up my head
Put it on your wall
Put me in the school book, put me in the laws
Put me in the desk and in the Synagogue
Firefly glow when they catch ya
Wanna catch ya when ya lights go dim
Wanna turn you to a letter in their logo
Wanna stick you in a jar with a pen
You an icon

[Chorus: Madonna]
"I-can't", "icon" - two letters apart
One step away from being lost in the dark
Just shine your light like a beautiful star
Show the world who you are who you are
Yeah, there's another part of you no one sees
There's a burning fire that's underneath
Baby, don't you know you were meant to be
Born to be, meant to be
