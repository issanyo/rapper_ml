[Refrain]
Heads bowed for the curly haired sons of Abraham
Dear Father, guide all my brothers away from Sam
If they ever get caught let's hope they shake that jam
If they ever get caught let's hope they shake that jam
Shake that jam
Heads bowed for the curly haired sons of Abraham
Dear Father, guide all my brothers away from Sam
If they ever get caught let's hope they shake that jam
If they ever get caught let's hope they shake that jam
Shake that jam

[Verse 1]
Chance The Rapper, song singer, senior, bong steamer
Light up hot wheels, locked up, wrong steamer
Dreamer, long Beemers, our neighbors their, lawns greener
We wrestle with envy then act up, John Cena
Chancellor Bennett, referred to as word chemist
The bourbon and slurred sentences is turning up burning bridges
Cigarette stained smile, all covered in sin
My big homie died young, just turned older than him
Getting hyped up off them bad bitches on it
Getting knocked up off a nigga, bad luck
Getting scared now with them IRS audits
All the tax money that I didn’t add up
That I didn’t get yet, but they think that I got it
Keep a long shirt so they think that I got it
And if they all dummy and a nigga get bodied
It was really, really ill, I know a nigga held up
Hell yeah I’ll always get a pic with y’all niggas
Word to my fans, all six of y'all niggas
I seen all the tweets and the tips from y’all niggas
Got hands for them niggas that pick on y'all niggas
Loving your love, an album to come
I bet that you love it, comes out in a month
Chance, the astounding class clown
That turned out to amount into something, 3001

[Hook]
I count my blessings too often
My best friends on one hand
My sheep when I’m done here
Gotta get up, get up
I count my blessings too often
My best friends on one hand
My sheep when I’m done here
Gotta get up, get up

[Verse 2]
Knock knock said the fist to the world
Shine sun through the mist and debris
Bang bang said the fist to the young
Silence from the lips of the free
Say something important, say something important
Make money the end of the week
But that shit coming soon, I’m getting hungry
Might sell out in a couple of weeks
But my crib they buckin’
And they just called Buddy, that’s lil bro
Even though last time we spoke
We was arguing, but we still stay close
Ask God to watch the squad
On God, battle niggas to the death, alright
Fuck your squad and the whole facade
I ain’t never scared of where a nigga reside
Extra mild sauce on the side, extra mileage on the ride
Express, I'mma grab my chain
Cause it’s extra violence all on the nine
Ten days, that’s an awful lot
Eleven squares in like fifteen minutes
Sixteens when that album comes
Spit twelve real quick for a listening picnic, igh!

[Hook]
I count my blessings too often
My best friends on one hand
My sheep when I’m done here
Gotta get up, get up
I count my blessings too often
My best friends on one hand
My sheep when I’m done here
Gotta get up, get up

If they ever get caught let's hope they shake that jam
