[Verse 1: Chance the Rapper]
I go full on when I rehearse, run it back like reverb
Wonder if they care how many cigarettes in each verse
Fifi on a feature, shaking like a seizure
Sounding like a sea shell, one horse on my t-shirt
My phone die twice a day, noodles in the microwave
In school, I threw my life away and a nigga towed my bike away
But now I'm woke, I'm wide awake, LA was the hideaway
Lying in the jungle but you will not take my pride away
Run it back like reverse or a backward t-shirt
Or a B with research but she put too much cheaters
Tuck and roll, tuck and roll, so many more blunts to fold
We is not the Huxtables, the tux is just to juxtapose
Tuck and roll, tuck and roll, it's so many blunts to fold
We is not the Huxtables, the tux is just to juxtapose
Tuck and roll, tuck and roll, it's so many blunts to fold
We is not the Huxtables, the tux is just to juxtapose

[Verse 2: Supa Bwe]
Caught her in some low light
She got no type
Speak up, these speakers loud like what I rolled right?
Why  you tellin' secrets, baby, I don't wanna gossip
I might show you where the light goes
But I know where you go at night
I been stackin' money on my tippy-toes
I'll be stackin' money 'til my ceiling grow, 'til the ceiling broke
Magic with the water and some talent, complicated potions
They call most of us niggas thugs, all these propagated notions
Keep the light like matches, damn, damn, damn, damn
Aurora Borealis, damn, damn, damn, damn
I don't talk to strangers, damn, damn, damn, damn
Cause that phony shit contagious, damn, damn, damn, damn
Parlay with a nigga like me
West side, chicken dinner, gizzards with some iced tea, damn, damn, damn, damn
Uncle Remus if you with it, I'm a fool wit it
I'm too gifted, we too lifted like new spirits
Chano you a fool wit it, damn, damn
Qari such a fool wit it, damn, damn
Hey I know where the light goes, damn, damn, damn
Yeah I know what to do with it, damn, damn, damn, damn

[Verse 3: Chance The Rapper]
Supa you a fool wit it
Qari  you a fool wit it
Supa you a fool wit it
Qari  you a fool wit it
I could show you light glow
I know what to do with it, hey
Supa you a fool wit it, damn, damn, damn, damn
Cam you a fool wit it, damn, damn, damn, damn
Chano, I'm a fool wit it, damn, damn, damn, damn
I know what to do with it, damn, damn, damn, damn
No we don't do not do snitchin'
No we don't do fission
Hit you with that new vision
Don't know what to do with it
Pull up in that new vented
You would think that you invented
But you know that I do it different
Pull up with that fool visit, who is it?
