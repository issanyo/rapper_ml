[Verse 1: Vic Spencer]
National Geographical
Concentrate on what's best to be classical when I'm after you
I'll make a movie outta rappers too
We'll fuck you up two ways
I feel like I'm acting too
Look like I received a Hollywood check
And I just fucked a broad who personally gave me that
So confident, Driving like D-Rose
Cruise so good, IRS was scared to repo
Stressed so I chain-smoke 3 'Ports
I ain't on, but I'm hated on the most
Smoke a lot, because I'm next to blow
Hot-boxing with the guys till my broad was like I'm rets' (ready) to go
I got other hoes dreaming 'bout my testicles
I ain't bringing no peace unless it is rest-able
I want a lot of rappers dead
I could make sure the pet lions get fed
They hired me to be one of the C.E.O's of all zoos
For all the bodies that I brought through
I live an orangutan lifestyle
It's quite foul for possums to hang from trees in the night-time
That's what paper is from, while the in fight lines
Put a commercial through my shit and I will kill you
Clear-Channel don't have a real view
Why have a penny for ya thoughts when I can bite dimes

[Verse 2: Chance the Rapper]
It ain't never been nothing to me
Shit, it ain't ever been nothing for free
Save it, I used to think shit was magic
I used to love Michael Jackson
I used to sit and imagine
Till I seen some shit too tragic
I'm just a bunch of atoms, I'm a national statistic
Love is just hormones and falling ain't shit but physics
And God don't pick up the phone and ain't shit out here sweet but mystics
I know I was pretty close but I guess that nigga just missed it
A nigga could take ya shoe game, a nigga could up ya suit game
I'm starting to get more sleep, I guess it could've been [?]
I thought that we was lions, it's how we end up in the food chain
But I never lost my pride. Save Money the new Wu-Tang
Ahhh, I think people think I'm losing it all
And I don't think I'm losing at all
Nah you right
I'm probably just gone screw up and fall
I put that on going to school in the fall
I guess that we made it
Through the summer
We was dodging some evenings
You know how close you come while you was bobbing and weaving?
Holding ya lungs, you was throbbing and wheezing
Look back at homie coughing and bleeding
Stopping and thinking that...
You so worried bout that 10Day
You don't know nights could be that night school
So if I ever end up missing
Just let me lay up in your iTunes
