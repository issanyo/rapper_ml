[Hook]
I'm coming for your spot, bitch
I'm coming for your spot

[Verse 1]
I ain't slept since I graduated
I'm so tired of this school shit
Niggas talking all that glad you made it
I'm getting tired of the bullshit
Posted like facebook walls
Ask me if I care how her face look, naw
Snap back to reality, back pack and a snapple
We so far from moving jeans and backpacks from the mall
And Chance laughing em off, hand smackin em all xanax in a ball
Shoulda said lean but the lean put on the house if the track buy me a couch
No back pack in the fall, no plan back for me to fall
No man left for me to ball up
It's too risky, it's just a mistake
So crispy, is that a mixtape? Is that an album? Shutup

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
For your spot, for your top
I'm off of mine
I'm off the line, sometimes you thought I wrote it
I did, no that's bogus I'm lying but I'm focused like a ford
Can you afford? A verse from the man of the yord? Of the year?
Next it's New York next it's back to Cali, shouts to Dally Auston
I do this often, and shouts to Austin the video's awesome
They wanna know more, they wanna know why but he flossing
Now you know I'm lying now you know I'm offing eat em up lunch em
If you fuck up better punch em' is that still a freestyle?
IDK I eat cake, I still cake, with my bitch
Ripping off the top, throw up the fists for niggas that still rapping that bitch
Attack shit all and stack shit, it's still so fun to play in my car

[Outro]
I'm coming for your spot, bitch
I don't give a fuck about you or any of your shit that you...
I'm coming for your spot
