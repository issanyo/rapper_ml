[Hook: Taylor Bennett]
Reach for your goals, hear what you're told
Think that you know
See what you're shown, watch it get old
Watch, it gets old
Teach what you learn, speak what you heard
Hear what you're told
Nothin' but words
Watch it get old, it only gets old

[Verse 1: Taylor Bennett]
Teach what you learn
Nothin' but words just like this verse
Reach for the air
Fall to the dirt, damn don't that hurt?
Watch it gets old, speak what ya heard
Hear what you're told
See what you're shown, think that you know
Watch, it only gets old

Man I'm only gettin' older, longer legs and bigger shoulders
Heard I'm gettin' smarter, not dumber
Heart turn cold when it's hot in the summer
Since seven I been daydream, drivin' in a Hummer
Throwin' hundreds out the window to my kinfolks
Sippin' Hen-o, chiefin' indo
Like we indoors but it's no doors on my new Porsche-I-guesssss
I just be tweakin' though
And dream the unthinkable
And prayin' it may come true
Hopin' it do come soon
And then I'm gon' make my move
But still I'm not bulletproof
We could all sing the blues
We could all hear the news but I ain't come here to lose
And I will not be removed

[Hook: Taylor Bennett]
Reach for your goal, hear what you're told
Think that you know
See what you're shown, watch it get old
Watch, it gets old
Teach what you learn, speak what you heard
Hear what you're told
Nothin' but words
Watch it get old, it only gets old

[Verse 2: Chance The Rapper]
I've been too quick with the advice
I just wanna be right like a dad right?
When you walkin' in my shoes I'mma tie it tight
You could tie a tie like you ride a bike
Ichabod cry when he ride at night
Head on his shoulders ain't his own
Someone told him his favorite song
Someone told him to watch his tone
Someone warned him of danger zones
Who forced the hand to make the clone?
Who stands in line to take the throne?
We only know what we know until someone knows better
A rose by any other text will still be Rosetta, hmm

[Hook: Taylor Bennett]
Reach for your goals, hear what you're told
Think that you know
See what you're shown, watch it get old
Watch, it gets old
Teach what you learn, speak what you heard
Hear what you're told
Nothin' but words
Watch it get old, it only gets old
Reach for your goals, hear what you're told
Think that you know
See what you're shown, watch it get old
Watch, it gets old
Teach what you learn, speak what you heard
Hear what you're told
Nothin' but words
Watch it get old, it only gets old

[Verse 3: Taylor Bennett]
Watch her get older and older until she don't wanna be known as your daughter
Watch him get older and older until he forgets everything that you taught him
Watch her get Instagram, instafriends, hips and fans, call you when she hits rock bottom
Watch him get in a jam, he claims he's innocent, but you know your son's a liar
Watch her develop while you tryna catch up, it's 21 years but arriving
22, look he grew, he's not the man you knew, now he's a man that's just like you
Lovin' the fam, you grew God had a plan for you, now you think Jesus forgot you
Look at the fam you grew, God had a plan for you, when you thought Jesus forgot you

[Hook: Taylor Bennett]
Reach for your goal, say what you're told
Think that you know
See what you're shown, watch it get old
Watch, it gets old
Teach what you learn, speak what you heard
Hear what you're told
Nothin' but words
Watch it get old, it only gets old
Reach for your goal, hear what you're told
Think that you know
See what you're shown, watch it get old
Watch, it gets old
Teach what you learn, speak what you heard
Hear what you're told
Nothin' but words
Watch it get old, it only gets old
