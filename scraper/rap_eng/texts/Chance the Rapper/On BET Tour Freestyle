4 or 5 hours on the road
I was doin' doughs, I was gettin' golds
I was in Africa, I was gettin' gold
I was with Nate, Nate said wait
Put it on a steak, put it on a plate
Call up my homies in another state(Ooh!)
Gettin' hella great
Gettin' hella cheese, put it on a grate
That's shredded cheese
(You too hot. Light fire on these bitches!)
FWOOSH!!!
