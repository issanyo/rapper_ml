[Verse]
Scorpion tattoo covers his shoulder
Sting of the tail leaves you colder
4 in the morning with Folgers
I was raised to be a soldier
And it's because of the help from my dad
I used to hate him for the welts on my back
But I love you chores, sweep up the floors
Under the couch and behind the doors
He taught me to stand on my own two
My teacher said "Oh he's a fan of the old school?"
I said "Naw, he's the principal
And he ain't scared of bullets, he's invincible"
And he taught me to look in the eyes of every grown man
Not as if you owe him but as if you own him
6 o'clock in the morning, yawning
Cause real men don't sleep past dawn and we on it
Already doin' pushups in tank tops
Thanks Pops for everything I have and what I ain't got
When I blow up like atom bombs I'mma spit it at 'em dumb
Fifty mil just between dad and moms
This is just hard, how many gift cards did I give up just cause?
Not enough to match the plight of your own father sayin
"I gotta catch a flight, but you could tape it right?"
You could save money or you could save a life
You could blame mommy or you could make it right
Everything that you taught me, I noted
The things, I quoted but the music, I wrote it
All a man has in this world is his word
And all I really want is a second to be heard
And I'm just searching for a witness
But this is my in the pen dance, uh!
This is my in the pen dance, uh!
This is my in the pen dance, uh!
Welcome to in the pen dance, uh!
This is my in the pen dance
This is my in the pen dance, uh!
