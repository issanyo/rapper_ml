[Official "Fear" Lyrics]

[Interlude]
I just wanted y'all to know
In case y'all didn't know
Fear is of Satan (Amen!)
And there's a lot of scary niggas out there
But I just want y'all to know
I ain't scared of uhhh
Shit
So
Because of that
Ima just keep on rocking (rocking, rocking)
Until it's Over (over, over)


[INTRO]
Fear it's just an illusion
Jump out the plane what if you survive
Oh the fact of you gonna die
Then you say
You haven’t done everything in your life
Haven’t said all, goodbyes
But aren’t those just excuses
If you don’t take action, then who is
Cause the second you get home
You become a liar
Just so you wouldn’t have to walk thru the fire


[VERSE 1]
Fear can create you into something you’re not
It’ll come & get you when you’re changing all your thoughts
You try and be was positive as you can
You over come it all, all them prescribed xans
I’ve never lied but I wanna be safe
The thought of falling in love, maybe some day
I only think about that ex that did me wrong
And then it turns me weak
When I know that I’m strong
Then my insecurity comes along
Maybe thats why I should've never went to f— prom
They said it was better
Can’t have you bring all this gloomy ass weather
I don’t want to lose anybody anymore
The pain it's like once before
I can't please everyone and whats the point of trying
You can make them smile, but whats the point of lying

So I can be me and continue try
And have people tell me no, just to have them deny—
Me
When it’ll just lead me
To getting back stabbed again
So I could just be left in the deep end?
Be left to drown again?

I'll fit in
But they are not my friends


They’re my enemies
Yeah, they’re my enemies
Thats the devil trying to get to me
But I’m on the right path
I don’t even think about the beautiful past
Even tho life was terrible, definition of bad
But I’m here still faithful
Blessing on my lap
I gotta stay Grateful
Especially when i feel sad

[Chorus] (x4)
Running down the block
You gone block
Me
From my blessings


[Bridge]
Alright
Alright
Im bout to go off
Im bout to go off



You gone mess around w the sin
You gone be dead by the end of this
You gone fall in love by the end of this
Been losing all the senses now— then
It’s sorta, but more kinda recklessness
Shut up lemme finish my sentences

Never talked on you
You don’t even know me dude
Don’t assume i’m afraid
Overcoming fear by the age
Over came  standin on a stage
Been walking on a roof
Can’t you hear me spitting truth

I got love for y’all
Don’t mean I won’t murder y’all
I'll go circus y’all
Sure you sit down when you done at all
Sure you wasted my time
Like dawgs that lie
I'm on top of it
Don’t care if there’s locks in it
Need the message in a bottle with
Open then do send
Stupid you hating
On me and and my team
Which is me and G-O-D-
Cause I fall when I pray
Pass me the plate
Bow your head
Need to say grace
Pressin on me
DND, ready to play
DND
On this like white tee with a stain

But I ain’t got nothing to lose
I'm ticking y’all better better defuse
Y’all smelling like poop
Need a different perfume

No cussing anymore
You washed up beach, shore
Yeah I’m pretty sure
I'm funnier when I don’t cuss
No need to fuss
God watching me
That’s why He blessed me w lady
I’ve been blessed

Decked
Comin' at my momma
I’ll come for the neck
Or I’ll let the karma do it’s job
Turning GOAT's into frogs

No shade
But that shit was fake
No shade
Just calling out the snakes
’m assuming and running my mouth
Turkey, ham, what’s this real beef about?
Like Jordi, that’s the kid
Then others that’ll wanna take your bitch
But can you blame him?
He was “doing you a favor”
He just seen that
And some need a taste, flavor

Cause damn
People real life really turn on you
They be like pause—
We need a sequel
Turn around—
See em talk s— on you
Talk about how much you wanna hit
But can't you see i’m just a lame talkin’
I don’t know anythin’
But you can’t see the truth that i’m thinkin’

Life just called
I declined the call
Left a voicemail, told me i won
Told me they were done
Now they’re giving it up
Always trying to mess me up
I’ve learned too much
I've got too many blessings to pass up
I don't believe in stupid little luck
I’ve been blessed by the Man Above
