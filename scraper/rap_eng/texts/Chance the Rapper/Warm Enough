[Hook: Noname]
Who are you to tell me
I'm not warm enough for summertime?
I know that I get beside myself
But you don't know me like the sun
You've never seen my horizon

[Verse 1: Noname]
If I was everything I never was
Drugs got me bubbly suddenly mumbling
Simile meant to be for you now
The futile go fishing for moon over roof top
A new style for praying to everything I ever loved
My black boy outer space looking like a rain child
But my body move like the sun
Go run til 'em rainbow we painted it 50 shades of grey
Stones across the lake, the house in the house
Deceptive carnations, our wedding we announced
On Sunday for the holy of it
Solely covet me and you, for you and I
Are blissfully tethered to simple redeeming
When sadness gets worse and we don't know why
Our city is bleeding for crimson
I don't protest, I just dance in my shadows
Hallow be thy empty
When my name don't sing, shallow waters
Under bridges don't forget 'bout me
Who are you to love me and not call me by my name?
I'm sunny, I'm sunny, just like you... Noname

[Verse 2: Chance the Rapper]
Like the sun, like the sun
Who are you to tell me I can't love you
The way mothers love daughters?
The way Mary was closest to Joseph
And babies is close to The Father
You don't know me and love got a secret hand shake
And mad inside jokes
I could tell it’s knock knock when my heart beatbox
Use your inside vox
Who are you to tell me I don’t want you
The way flesh wants freedom
The way greed love need, the way kings need kingdoms
You don’t know what I know, what I’m capable of
What I slaved for and traded in favours
And gave up for you what I gave up for love

[Hook: Noname]
Who are you to tell me
I'm not warm enough for summertime?
I know that I get beside myself
But you don't know me like the sun
You've never seen my horizon

[Verse 3: J. Cole]
You like the flower that I won’t let die
Right before your petals start to wilt
I choose to give you one last try
Fill your vase up with water, refusin’ to neglect you
Like your father, so I promise that it won’t run dry
Good intentions 'cause I wanna see us both fly
But I often put me first and I been wonderin’ why
I know you probably think you’re blessed
To have a wonderful guy
And that’s the truth but at the same time a wonderful lie
Cause to me you’re a dime and I’m still a nickel
And you know niggas say that every coin got two sides
Well if you knew both minds not sure you’d like what you find
I made mistakes, I want to tell you but can’t make up my mind
As I’m writing this I see a red balloon in the sky
And to me that’s a sign tellin’ me that these lines
Were meant to be written, repentin’ in the form of a rhyme
I know the Lord’s a forgiver, hope he’ll forgive me in time

[Hook: Noname]
Who are you to tell me
I'm not warm enough for summertime?
I know that I get beside myself
But you don't know me like the sun
You've never seen my horizon
