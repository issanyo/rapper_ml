[Chance]: Alright im the rapper, i'm from chicago. I'm 21

[Charlemagne]: You're a rapper? I would've never guessed

[Chance]: Yeah yeah i'm the rapper, but im an artist of sorts and im from chicago, im for the people and i got 2 mixtapes

[Charlemagne]: Acid Rap is one, that came out a couple years ago

[Chance]: That would be the one that you know

[Angela]: Right, the one before that..

[Chance]: 10 Day: You might know it you might not know it

[DJ Envy]: Now explain the concept of 10 day

[Chance]: 10 day was recorded while i was on 10 day suspension from high school

[DJ Envy]: What'd you do? why you get suspended?

[Chance]: I had marijuanna, i don't know what the rules are for FM radio. I'm just saying, I had weed, not really a lot of weed,but like on school property i guess

[Charlemagne]: What like a half a zip, a zip?

[Chance]: Nah like maybe a quarter, maybe a quarter

[Charlemagne]: ok were you selling or smoking?

[Chance]: I was smoking but they were tryna say i had intent to sell, but i didn't i had it in one bag it was for me. It doesn't matter

[Charlemagne]: Did you tell them you were a user?

[Chance]: I wasn't really tryna say nothing to em. I didn't know what was incriminating and what was not, so i was chilling but they gave me the suspenion

[Charlemagne]: Did somebody tell on you, because let me tell you something. When i was in high school, and I probably shouldn't say this-

[Envy]: That was a long time ago

[Charlemagne]: -We used to get money when we used to tell on people for having weed

[Angela]: What? What kinda snitch-

[Chance the Rapper]: Paid informant? Damn

[Charlemagne tha God]: So there were these like lame dudes I know, like what is he doing with weed? I would go tell on them id go to the principal and be like he got weed in his shoe

[Angela]: So you've always been like this

[Charlemagne]: Because the lame dudes were tryna act cool and be like "yo look i got weed i got a gun" so we'd tell on them and get money

[Angela]: wow so you got gun charges for people and everything

[Chance]: that's messed up

[Charlemagne]: So did somebody tell on you?

[Chance]: I hope not that would be crazy if i found out somebody told me that i think it was just the school was into what i was on and stuff so they kinda followed me around.The police officer that was issued to the school kinda randomly checked my lcoker and all types of stuff. And he was actually the one who found me. I was a little bit actually a couple blocks away from school cuz i went to school downtown. So i was in an alley somewhere and the dude just walked up on me grabbed me took me back to the school, made sure the kicked me outta school, then took me the station

[Envy]: So it was 10 days, and you did a mixtape in the library. There was studio equipment in the library?
