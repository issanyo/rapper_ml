Fuck you pillow talking niggas
Fuck You pocket watching niggas
Fuck you dick eating niggas
Fuck you hating niggas.......

(Yeah..... Look)
The worst thing u can be is a rat or a snake
Never complain about my plate I’m jus glad that I ate
Never spit behind my back nigga rap to my face
U like Kermit in the cleaners, I’m actually like ace
Yea, my shit is paid in full
This piece of plastic is a major tool, I’m charging like a raging bull
U peep the way I’m charging when I’m makin moves
I told them I’m an artist and they hated, kool
The ones that smile the most are the ones that are fake
The same niggas that u love are the ones that will hate
The ones that talk behind ya back n show love in ya face
Idk who’s worst them or the ones on the gate
Yea, Tryin to straddle fence
U wanted to stay clear, is a bad defense
Awful friendship
I tell u I love u that means my heart is in it
That means we on this marathon from start to finish

To them niggas that say they love u and left u don’t ever feel like u need em

When u get bak on your shit with out no help, wheneva u see em ,make sure u scream it
