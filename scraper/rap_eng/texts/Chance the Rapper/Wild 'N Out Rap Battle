[Nick Cannon]
I got three babies, and everyone know it
Rac', Monroe and a little Golden

[Chance The Rapper]
And a little poet, I think that I win
I hope that you and Mariah split up them twins

[Nick Cannon]
Split up them twins, we gone all the time
I see them everyday that I can rhyme

[Chance The Rapper]
Every I rhyme, I do my lines
I think you should stick down to drumline

[Nick Cannon]
Stick to drumline, I got more movies tho
Matter a fact I just did three in a row

[Chance The Rapper]
Three in a row and I think that that's perfect
But I think you should take off that damn turban

[Nick Cannon]
Take off this turban, man how can you say that
I don't even know because you don't wanna play that
I'll take you down, this is my crown
Rapping from New York, now how that sound

[Chance The Rapper]
It's going down, I came to play
I came to clown, I came to say
I think it's cool that you play lockers
That you play.... is that soccer?

[Nick Cannon]
Yes I play soccer
And you know feel it
Because when I kick it I pick up and kill it
Man you gone deal with it
Man I'm just spill with it
Nick Cannon the realest and you know that I'm the illest so...

Pick up and kill it and kill it and kill it

[Chance The Rapper]
I am not one of them goofy ass niggas
I think that you take off pants with them zippers
I know that I am the coolest, the realest
And I can go realer, I'm from Chi-Town
When I do my shit, I never write down
I'm off the top and I'm wearing my crown
This is New York, but I think it's my town
