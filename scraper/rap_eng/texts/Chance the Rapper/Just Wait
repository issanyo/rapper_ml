[Instrumental]

[Verse: Chance The Rapper]
Spend the night, spend the money
Send off flight, for the tummy
Bit of a pickle, she tuck her tommy
Rugrat, bare skin, fair skin
Since pan afro-merican
Actor in air
Air's thin, new floor
E'erything, e'erything
Who knows, is e'erything still e'erything?

[Hook]
What a delicate heart, what a hard head
What a delicate heart, what a hard head
Good things come to those that wait
Good things come to those that wait
What a delicate heart, what a hard head
What a delicate heart, what a hard head
Good things come to those that wait
Good things come to those that wait

[Outro]
Good things come, good things come
Good things come, good things come
Then they go, then they go
Then they go, then they go
Good things come, good things come
Good things come, good things come
Then they go, then they go
Then they go, then they go
Good things come, good things come
Good things come, good things come
Then they go, then they go
Then they go, then they go
Good things come, good things come
Good things come, good things come
Then they go, then they go
Then they go, then they go
