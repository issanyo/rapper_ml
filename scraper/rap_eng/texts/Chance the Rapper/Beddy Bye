[Intro]
Growin' up in Chicago was pretty d so, there's a lot of things that I remember - Bo Squad, goin' to Skinner School, goin' to Jones College Prep, uh workin' with my dad on the campaign for Barack. No no, it was just a lot of things and I have to say goodbye to all of them now that I'm leaving for Washington DC as a lot of you guys know. So I wrote this song, it's called "Beddy Bye" and you'll get the gist of the song as it goes along

[Verse]
Loose stares, train fares, frooties, chews
Big bowls and loose squares
Top notch hamburger
Miracle workers, juke music and foot workers
Dude who stand outside of Old Navy crazy
We shop in Marshall Field's and never call it Macy's
Chicago to me, is the kingdom of hearts
I dance through streets where a king once marched
It's always where you finish and it's never where you start
And I can't outsmart when we move in the dark
This track is hard to listen to again
And now I'm swimmin' in thoughts of lake missin'-you-again
Chicago I'mma marry you with a ring from Jared's
A million carats of rocks the kids moved above your terrace
You were the meeting place of my parents
Now my bubbles popped like corn from Garrett's
You scared so I leave street lights as night light
Leave sky scrapers, high risers and those bright lights
I know you clouds'll cry in the morn'
So I'ma gonna leave on that midnight flight
Beddy bye, beddy bye to the C-H-I
C-H-Y I gotta tuck you in
Knowin' that there'll be no good mornin'
But I say "Beddy bye" to keep my eyes from pourin'
Cause goodnight and goodbye both hurt my throat
And it hurts to know, and it hurts to go
So sweet dreams as I head for the sky
But I couldn't go without saying "Beddy Bye"
