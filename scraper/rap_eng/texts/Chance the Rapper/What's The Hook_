[Intro: Reeseynem]
Ah, ha, ha, ha
Aw shit, nigga done lucked up (ha, ha, ha)
Aw shit, what's the hook then?

[Chorus: Reeseynem & Chance The Rapper]
Thought I got slammed what's the hook then? (what's the hook?)
I got out that jam what's the hook then? (what's the hook?)
Aw shit, aw shit, what's the hook then (what's the hook then?)
Thought they had me slammed
What's the hook then? (what's the hook?)
Fuck it, let me off the- (oh, what's the hook?)
Thought they had me slammed
What's the hook then? (what's the hook?)
Fuck it, let me off the hook (oh, what's the hook?)

[Verse 1: Reeseynem & Chance The Rapper]
Uh, uh, fuck it then, let me off the hook (let me off the hook)
Since a nigga black, they tried to throw the book
(they throw the book)
I ain't even look back or take a look (take a look)
I ain't even look again or take a look (take a look!)
Look, this shit like space, take a book (take a book)
I just had to switch my king with my rook (switch it with my rook)
Get my bands up, put some money on this book (on this book)
Don't come around flexin', boy that shit took
Niggas be flossin' and they be lyin', I don't even stand for it (hee)
Say they got a thang, paid a band for it (hee, hee)
Hatin' on a bitch because she had to dance for it (hee)
Even though she got it (hee)
They ain't even got the cash for it (hee)
We just playin' the cards we dealt, nigga, we ain't ask for it
Knew we was them niggas from day one, now fast forward
I remember when I was broke and I ain't had the cash for it
Now I go up in the store and just pay some cash for it
(what's the hook?)
More flexin', more lessons in my speech
Rap niggas said they got it, niggas be lyin' through their teeth
What's a million to a billion, what's 10 thousand to a G
If you ain't tryin' to get it with me, nigga fuck you, R.I.P

[Chorus: Reeseynem & Chance The Rapper]
Thought I got slammed what's the hook then? (what's the hook?)
I got out that jam what's the hook then? (what's the hook?)
Aw shit, aw shit, what's the hook then (what's the hook?)
Thought they had me slammed
What's the hook then? (what's the hook?)
Fuck it, let me off the- (no, no)
Thought they had me slammed
What's the hook then? (what's the hook?)
Fuck it, let me off the hook (off the hook, hee! hee! hee! hee!)

[Verse 2: Chance The Rapper]
Let me get a pass, get the-get the pass
Young boy on his path, leave it runnin' like the bath
Workin' on my biceps, I coulda been workin' on my calves
Workin' on my chest all day
Could've been workin' on my abs and back
And I'm workin' on this money
All my cousins country but they do not love the country
Yeah, it's a wrap like mummy, never been a dummy
Since I was in my mommy tummy, yeah
Coming off the hook like dial tones
Numbers comin' in like Dow Jones
In the pocket like calzone
Condo Batcave, found home
Huh-huh, where's Falcone?
Live as the hero or die alone
How the fuck is they gon' be on your side and you on top
Don't that mean they gon' sli-i-i-ide til you stop
Catching flies with honey, catchin' fishes using sharks
Number one question that they askin' at the dock
"What's the hook?"

[Chorus: Reeseynem & Chance The Rapper]
Thought I got slammed what's the hook then? (what's the hook?)
I got out that jam what's the hook then? (what's the hook?)
Aw shit, aw shit, what's the hook then (what's the hook?)
Thought they had me slammed
What's the hook then? (what's the hook?)
Fuck it, let me off the- (no, no)
Thought they had me slammed
What's the hook then? (what's the hook?)
Fuck it, let me off the hook (off the hook)
