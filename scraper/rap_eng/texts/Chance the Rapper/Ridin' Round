[Hook]
I'm ridin' round, ridin' round, ridin' round wit a lot of dope
Ridin' round, ridin' round, ridin' round wit a lot of dope
Ridin' round, ridin' round, ridin' round wit a lot of dope
I get a lot of dough, ridin' round wit a lot of dope
(2x)

[Video Verse: eGo]
I'm ridin' round wit a lot of dope
You ridin' round wit a lot of dro
My white bitch like white bitch
That mean she snort a lot of blow
I'm sick bitch, but I don't cough much
New Bentley wagon boss truck
I don't cost much, I'm lined up
Yo girlfriend, she lying nude
In my bed with great head, and I bet we practice safe sex
My speakers blasting,yeah that hard work is in my tape deck
I'm the motherfucking man, bro, I can't be stopped
And my Mike stock dead bruh, they can't be copped
I say I ridin' round my side of town
Hotboxing while cops around
My lil' niggas Savemoney squad
I'll have them niggas chop you down
My blunt lit, my cup full
I don't really care bout drunk driving
We'll shut her down
Me and Leo, we be on Stunt Island
From the city of the Goat, where anybody go
For that nigga go, ball like sco
That's score bitch, you a whore bitch
My crib got it's own orbit
I should forfeit? That's horseshit
Sick Life so I'll enforce it, you dumb bitch
My thumbprint what I open my door with

[Hook]

[Verse 1: eGo]
Ridin' round wit my bad bitch
Killin' niggas, it's tragic
And you cash chase, I cash get
Make your girl disappear, its magic
I'mma boss, you a gay man
I be chillin' in the Caymans
I'm out, lil nigga stay in
I can't see you in my Ray Bans
I'm on lil man, you off nigga
Don't ask what it cost nigga
I been on the floss nigga
Ralph Lauren, fuck Lacoste nigga
22s on the feet, I skate by
Fuckin' old heads up, I'm A.I
But I won't flop, and I'm gon' pop
Watch ya girl get low, I stay high
New white Range, but the Chevy nice
Lotta fuckin chrome, that's crazy ice
And its crazy right, that I won't lose
Pickup game I won't choose
And I don't play, if you don't pay
You'll see why I'm from four-trey
I'm sick, I'm dope dog
Ion really spit bars, I'm coke dog
From the city of the 'Go, where anybody go
For that nigga Go, I'll ball like sco
That's score bitch, you a whore bitch
My crib got its own orbit
I should forfeit? That's horseshit!
Sick Life bitch, I enforce it
You dumb bitch, my thumbprint's
What I open my door wit

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Chance The Rapper]
Riding around like skrrrttt, driving up on the curb
BB gun to your head, bitch is you scared?
Niggas get murked, feelings get hurt
Bink bink bink bink if you think that its sweet
Click clack
Hit licks, hit nigga with a big bat
No simpin' for me people, where my bitch at?
In the passenger seat, with a hand in her kit kat
Kidnap your bitch, put her body in the trunk
Ghost ride the clip, nobody in the park
Put a lucy in the air, and the Saudi in a blunt
Cold body with a cab, but I probably should've jumped
Save up, save up, can't no nigga touch my scrilla
Except for all my brothers and you nigga unfamiliar

[Hook]
