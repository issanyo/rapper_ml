[Verse: Taylor Bennett]
How you doing? It's Taylor Bennett, the famous rapper
I wanna take you out and maybe even party after
You can crash in, prolly catch the morning after
Got booked over paper, that's another chapter
I wanna move to the hills where the breeze right
Know I like it when your pencil start to write
We gotta get it on the dance floor tonight
Baby, I'm a smooth typer, baby, I'm a you type
Woke about my future, line up reality
Mind of a different galaxy
Mama said eat your vegetables, celery turns to salary
Selling souls while I'm only addicted to forms of casualty
Casualty is a tragedy
Young cause of catastrophe, drop boy moving galleries
Evil is just a half of me
Greatest grace, my anatomy
Adam and Eve's apple in me, probably screaming feel 'em
Dreamin' thank god for the trade I, for the way I
Roll up in a Beemer, hold up, slick nigga
Moving that weight, fit nigga, guap, guap
Rich nigga, doper than dope
I got bricks in the side of my watch cause my wrist killing
Niggas be tweaking, I'm tweaking them out
So why I'm the nigga you tweeting about?
Trashy ass rappers, I'm cleaning them out
See, be the reason my phone ringing out
Give me a call about nothing at all
Giving me calls about nothing at all
Giving me calls about nothing at all
Giving me calls about nothing at all
