[Hook: Detail, Lil Wayne, and Chance the Rapper]
You can look me in my face
I ain't got no worries (I ain’t word) x3
See them shroomies keep me up
So I ain't got no worries (I ain’t word) x3
You see money right there
Yeah that's (me) right there
Yeah that's (me) right there
And we ain't got no worries
You see pussy right there
Redbone mangos right there
See them shroomies right there
We ain't got no worries

[Verse 1]
D. Rose on that ass, that means back again
I hit my Zan so hard
Man, I've been practicing
I'm going straight to the league, and not by accident
Don't get your ass kicked in
I'll hoop in Shaqs and Timbs
Chit chat with Chris Mintz-Plasse
And laugh at Jags and rims
T-T-Y-L-ing the labels and L-O-L-ing they friends
Hello Hell and Heaven, you haven't heard the half of it
Have at it half-happy
30-something year old, broke graduate
Over the wave like du-rags,getting paper like dude rap
Nineteen, making that "I could be damn near fucking Erykah Badu" rap
Girbaud flow is too strapped
My screws loose, I'm too slapped
Just got this bitch too turnt
Just got my nose 2Pac'd
L.A Reid like, "Who's that?
Jimmy Iovine like, "Who's that?
Whole world like, "Who's that?
Whole hood like ‘dude ass’
I'm from little shorties with the shot up shirt
Where babies get kilt like a Scottish skirt
95-ing down the Ryan
And I'm flying, skirrt
Keep on asking if I'm trying niggam I ain't word

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Unreluctant optimist, most poppingest
Got popular,try topping this, Triceratops
BJs from baby bopping bitches
Throat lozenges
Massaging it, no touching it
Okay, touch on it
But don’t rush on it
Ration it, passionate
While imagining me smashing it
Dash out at like 4:30,hands smelling like potpourri
They ain’t give my nigga no jury, so I don’t give no nigga no mercy
When my little fucking brother rap better than you
My shit get your girl way wetter than you
You rap veterans you, my nerdy brethren you
Stuff you in a fucking locker, 10 Day letterman you
You wanna jock me, jockers (AAH)
My style’s fathering you
I know it’s bothering you
Probably an anomaly
But it’s probably niggas that’s probably starving for new shit you could sound like
That’s that shit that I don’t like
But I ain’t really worried
I’m a wordy motherfucker
I could hurry
But I’m buried in her pussy from the last tape
