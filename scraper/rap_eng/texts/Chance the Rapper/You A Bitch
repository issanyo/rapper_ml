[Intro: AZ + (Nas)]
Aiyo, what's up, what's up?
Let's keep it real, son, count this money
You know what I'm sayin'? (Yeah yeah)
Aiyo, put the Grants over there in the safe
You know what I'm sayin'?
â€˜Cause we spendin' these Jacksons
The Washingtons go to wifey, you know how that go
(I'm sayin' that's what this is all about right
Clothes, bankrolls and hoes)

[Hook: Chance The Rapper]
You a bitch
And when I say bitch I don't mean a bitch
But speakin' of bitches I'm with your bitch
And you ain't on shit cause you'se a bitch
You's a bitch
You a bitch
And when I say bitch I don't mean a bitch
But speakin' of bitches I'm with your bitch
And you ain't on shit cause you'se a bitch
You a bitch

[Verse 1: Kami de Chukwu]
Love or her not
As long as she run through your thots
Then she the best that you got
Focused on tying the knot
Or the run down, come up, I keep it on lock
Bitch
Fuckin' deuce, bitch

[Verse 2: Chance The Rapper]
Who is you, is you the same?
You'se a lame
I'm you shit you'se a nuisance
Lose your life when I told you that you should hang
You should beg
You should beg with chasers
Stop chasin' Chance
I be takin' chances when I be tryna blaze a dance
Raise a man
Thumbin' through like lasers when I laser beam
You'se a fuckin' loser and you chase it with some (?)
I need me some magic beans and a fuckin' stalker
So I could climb that bitch to the top of mount of lava
And the whole damn parkin' lot
But it be ridin', it be ridin' all my niggas just like Dennis
They be robbin', they be Rodman
I'm comin' through it pimpin'
I be pimpin', I be drippin' when I'm off the fuckin' acid
And that

[Verse 3: Towkio]
Me I'm a pimp
All in your crib
With your bitch
Watchin' Netflix
Bet that I hit
She ask where you at me
I tell her don't trip
I tell her don't trip
Like hope you gettin' a hint
Hope you gettin' a hint
Or feelin' the rain
God damn motherfucker no gin
Let me hit

[Outro]
We're not against rap, we're not against rappers
But we are against those thugs
