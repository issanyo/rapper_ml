[Verse 1]
I want a Letterman jacket so bad that it hurts
And I hate my mom cause she makes me wear these shirts
I go to school just to get picked on
Every day they make me feel like I don’t belong
They hate me, because I’m different
The adults around me, they don’t hear me, they ain’t listening
To get love you better be popular
I'd love to see my name one day in the [monica?]
But I’mma need some basketball shorts
A cheerleader too and a basketball shirt
A box of Newports and a Gatorade sport
And a new pair of Jordans and a basketball court
Then the girl who will find me attractive
Love from my peers, you know, the whole package
I got the code to happiness and I could crack it
And all of this comes with the Letterman jacket

[Hook]
And as they all grow older, the truth will be understood
'Cause we never turn out the way we thought we would

[Verse 2]
I want a new nose and a brand new car
Then I could drive myself seemed[?] away so far
I wanna be loved, I wanna new start
A Botox mind and a silicone heart
We got collagen celebs and liposucked stars
I’m just lookin' for my own Wizard of Oz
To give me courage, forget a brain
Give me a straight nose and take away pain
Give me a big butt and a little bitty waist
Give me some glory with a prettier face
Give me a bottle of tequila and a cup and don’t smile
Give me a camera, give me a new Facebook profile
Give me some big breasts and some tight clothes
And I’ll have a boyfriend and friends and just pose in front of stores
And we’ll be loved, just wait
Please, Doctor Oz, can you make my nose straight?

[Hook]
And as they all grow older, the truth will be understood
'Cause we never turn out the way we thought we would

[Verse 3]
I want a football, I want to be thuggin’
Fuck it, I want an easy-bake oven
I want to be loved by my dad
But my dad said he can’t love no fag
So I’mma have to hide who my real self is
And hide who I like but I can’t help it
Doctor Oz, can you make me not gay?
Make me normal and take this pain away
Cause when you disdained, every day it rains
And I don’t want to be better, I just want to be the same
Mister Wiz, I wanna live in a normal way
Normal, according to those others that pray
But your blessings and needles just take characters away
So I would rather be different in a similar way
Being gay is cool with me, so let me say
Fuck a football, I'll take an easy-bake any day

[Hook]
And as they all grow older, the truth will be understood
'Cause we never turn out the way we thought we would
