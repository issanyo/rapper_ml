[Intro: Not3s]
High five, ayy
Chaca Laca Vroom vroom
I ain't scared of anything
Yoa, it's Not3s

[Verse 1: Chance The Rapper, Sharper]
Sharper:  I made you sit next to me
And now I'm stuck here with you
Yeah, it is all my fault
I can hear the phone ringing
Hey, yeah
So I picked it up and said
Hi, who is it? Who the f*** are you?
Just you and me, it's my fault

Chance The Rapper: Jeez, I ain't your friend
Yo, my motherf***er gon' talk to you 'bout that
She wanna put her loving like she wanna put her booty on that Gucci belt and she ain't stuntin' like she gon' do somein't
That isn't her c****** for a second
My b**** isn't in the cab yet
I just wake up your husband, f*** come back
This sh** ain't real - for a sec, I thought that your sl** was on the accountant, hey

[Chorus: Not3s]
Why do we have an emergency?
I just thought you were on my side
This c*** isn't right
I might've heard wrong or for an excitement
Can I explain why I'm late?
Please may you hurry up on eating your ice-cream sundé?
I just want to book a table for the buffet
I dunno how it taste but the smell is just great

Yaar, you can mess it up all you like
Cause there's no point in winning
Mmh, I was so f***ed up in life
But I just kept on and on swimming
(Chance The Rapper: Hey)

[Verse 2: Chance The Rapper]
Wait, what the ***kn... wait a minute
Are you worried 'bout  somewhere (ayy, ayy)
Slingshot, is it in my hight? (Offset!)
You know?
I got a f***n' big comma and I really won't worry 'bout it
Sí, I said I won't ever dare worrying about it, heyy
Hey (hey), I don't really wanna say it in front of the kids
But I just came to say that I love your BLEEP
I gotta go so I just gon' give you a good-bye kiss
Yeah-ayy

[Pre-Chorus: Not3s, Chance The Rapper, Sharper]
Not3s: Can you bring me the switch?
Chace The Rapper: Cause I'm leveling up this bad b****
Sharper: Ihp- I can't join your network, there's a glitch
Chance The Rapper: You see, I'mma dump you down out from that ditch
Not3s: Oh, you're morphine's always making me itch

[Chorus: Not3s]
Why do we have an emergency?
I just thought you were on my side
This c*** isn't right
I might've heard wrong or for an excitement
Can I explain why I'm late?
Please may you hurry up on eating your ice-cream sundé?
I just want to book a table for the buffet
I dunno how it taste but the smell is just great

Yaar, you can mess it up all you like
Cause there's no point in winning
Mmh, I was so f***ed up in life
But I just kept on and on swimming

[Post-Chorus 1: Not3s / Bridge 1: Sharper]
Not3s: Cause there's no point in winning
Eeh-oh-eeh-oh-eeh-oh-eeh-oh
(Sharper: But I just kept on swimming
Eeh-oh-eeh-oh-eeh-oh-eeh-oh)
Not3s: Cause there's no point in winning
Eeh-oh-eeh-oh-eeh-oh-eeh-oh
(Sharper: But I just kept on swimming
Eeh-oh-eeh-oh-eeh-oh-eeh-oh)

[Bridge 2: Sharper]
Why do we have an emergency?
You just thought I was on your side
This c*** isn't right
You might've heard wrong or for an excitement
Can you explain why I'm late?
You may hurry me up on eating my ice-cream sundé?
You just want to book a table for the buffet
You dunno how it taste but the smell is just great

Yaar, I can mess it up all I like
Cause there's no point in winning
Ayy, you were so f***ed up in life

[Post-Chorus 2: Sharper / Bridge 1: Not3s]
Sharper: But you just kept on and on swimming
Not3s: Eeh-oh-eeh-oh-eeh-oh-eeh-oh
Sharper: (Oh), There was no point in winning (in winning)
Not3s: Eeh-oh-eeh-oh-eeh-oh-eeh-oh (no, no ooh)
Sharper: (Swimming) - ooh - you just kept on swim-(hey baby)
(Not3s: eeh-oh-eeh-oh-eeh-oh-eeh-oh)
