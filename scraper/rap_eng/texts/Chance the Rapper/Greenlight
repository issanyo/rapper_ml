Okay now pop
Uh huh
Back and forth then stop, then drop
Uh huh
Bring it back to the top, don't stop
Green light, don't stop

[Verse 1: Brian Fresco]
Nigga like me don't chase no hoes
Smoke then it's back to the lab I go
Shorty in my ear tryna wife Fresco
Hell no, can't go, gotta wife my dough
This to the hoes for the days I owe
Still love a nigga if a nigga go broke
56 for the clothes, stripper pole for the show
Let's go to the mall, no we got to drive slow
We grooving, grooving
She's so exclusive, 'sclusive
She stay persuing
But my nigga tryna tell me she choosing, choosing
Like what she doing, doing
The way she move it, move it
Got a nigga into it
Might lay down make this music, music
Like, murder was the case on the pussy of the killer
She's so good, got her rolling up my swisher
With a broke nigga so you know I had to fix her
Couldn't leave her with a issue, got me harder than a missile
Like late night visions got her sending naked pictures
Showing all my niggas like nobody fucking with her
Knowing all them lame niggas in the air tryna get her
But she looking for that Fresco nigga that can heal her like

[Hook: Brian Fresco]
Green light, green light, shorty giving that green light
Pictures all on my screen like, shorty giving that green light
Green light, green light, tripping offa that bean like
Hands all in her jeans like, green light, green light

[Verse 2: Chance The Rapper]
Tick tick tick
Bout time you get, get, get
Your quick, quick, quick
Back rub in bath tub
Biting your lip, your lip
You've been doing your shit, your shit
You tired, real
Tighten your hips, your hips
Let me stretch you out
She be steady saying
Just got offa work
Ooh baby it hurts
Just do me first
Make it feel all good
Let me take off your shirt
Just do it it works
And I'm tired as fuck
Make it feel all good

[Hook]

Okay now pop
Uh huh
