[Steve G. Lover]
Get it from behind, I'mma need to back off
And I want face like a nigga took bathsalts
Ready here I go, hear me when I'm talking
Flyest nigga flying, realist nigga walking
(?) at the drive in
Bitches on my leg, got bitchest on my noggin
We gonna dive in like we deep sea diving
My girl, she chocolate, I love 'em all chocolate
I you know you know a nigga rock it
Money on my mind plus a little in my pocket
LA, I be out there on the seaside
Making waves nigga, chiling on the Eastside
Niggas all talk, niggas gotta rewind
Young Steve got shades I don't see time
So I'm late, CPT, see me yeah, see where a nigga be

[Chance The Rapper]
I'm in my tank top, and my shoes so stylish
On the road with Childish, off the top it's kinda freestylish
I need an island and a private
Jet to take me where I need to be
Off the top, I'm like TNT
Everytime I rap, I gotta blow up
Sometimes I'm late for soundcheck, I don't show up
Sometimes, all these hoes, just wanna blow 'em
My cellphone call me like one time, like two times
I'm off of the top, I got two rhymes
One, two ryhmes, say it twice though
Off the top I'm nice though
Got a white tee and a white ho
And a black (?) off of the top I'm kinda naughty
Or nauseous, cause I drank all of that coffee
Before I came out, I'm feeling like I'm too raw
I'm off of the top, I got two (?)
And two cups, call me 2 Chainz
Call me Batman, better yet call me Bruce Wayne
Call me Liu Kang, I kick it
Off of the top, tryna catch a snitch like Quidditch
Hit with it, off of the top, just stitch it
Like Lilo and Stitch did, back in '02 when I saw them at the movies...
