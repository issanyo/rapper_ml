Uh, I didn't think that... I didn't think that we were gonna get this one so I don't have cool stuff to say this time... I just... once again I wanna thank God for everything that he's accomplished for me, everything that he's went through with me. I wanna thank him for my father, for my mother, for my brother, Taylor Bennett. For my friends like Justin Cunningham and [?] and Darius White. And this is for every indie artist, everybody who's been doing this mixtape shh stuff for a long ass time. Shouts out to DJ Drama for doing it first! He put in that time. Shouts out to every independent artist out there. Shouts out to SoundCloud for holding me down. It's another record, baby!
