[Chance The Rapper]
I wanna kiss you on your band-aids
Wanna make you a house that's manmade
I want you as my bandmate
Let's collab but not really in music
Let's make jokes that's not really amusing
Let's make amends thats not really a movement
Let's make kids - that's not really a rap line
Let's make it seem like love lasts longer than life
And make believe thats not really a flatline
Make new words for love and old uses for Kodaks
Look through throwbacks like
You should grow your fro back
Let's get old together and never go back
To a life, to a world where we are both cats
Fall in love with your wrinkles
You'll never be single
I know that you think you'll be loose in this world
You, Always will twinkle
My star, I'm your Ringo
Play old people bingo
You beautiful girl

[Hook x4]
Love won't you fall asleep in my arms
While I read you these poems
I wrote you so long ago

[Milo]
In our ninth life
We fall and fail to land on our feet
But we beyond skin, what's a tombstone?
What's a love poem if not a pair of wings?
An anecdote for the hourglass, a cure for ticking in our veins
We rise above pain, the threat of times scissor blade
And I am unafraid
I know I've found a resting place in your arm's cave

[Hook]
