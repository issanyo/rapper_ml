[Verse 1: Jeremih]
Snow's in the air
Tree everywhere
Wind from the lake
Something in the air
Christmas is here
Bring your lady, chill
Zero below
Only in the door
Pretty ring, I know
But she hit the phone
Just what she own
Salt on the streets
Timbs on my feet
Best time to give
Chi-Town it is
Fam all around
Trying to run the town
Love how it smells
Bucket full of wings
Trying to give about five golden rings
Balling for the chills
Drinks on, get your smoke on
Winter break, no school zone
Footwork, yeah, get your step on on

[Hook: Jeremih]
Merry, merry christmas
This is what we call a Chi-Town Christmas
This is Chi-Town, this is a Chi-Town christmas
This is how we do it in the Midwest
This is Chi-Town, this is a Chi-Town christmas
This is what we call a Chi-Town Christmas
This is Chi-Town, this is a Chi-Town christmas
This is how we do it in the Midwest

[Verse 2: Chance The Rapper]
Jeremih on the beat
Lighting up a tree
7 nominees
I cannot believe
Pray for '79th
Pray for '79th
Ford City all the way to over East
I've been going in
Snow inside my Timbs
Frozen all my limbs
Big salt truck
Now I'm flying in
Where you wanna land?
Million pair again
Big boss bucks, baby
Finna hit the plaza
Cop a couple plasmas
You don't want no asthma
Mild sauce my wings
Nights at the rink
These are a few of my favorite things

[Hook: Jeremih]
Merry, merry christmas
This is what we call a Chi-Town Christmas
This is Chi-Town, this is a Chi-Town christmas
This is how we do it in the Midwest
This is Chi-Town, this is a Chi-Town christmas
This is what we call a Chi-Town Christmas
This is Chi-Town, this is a Chi-Town christmas
This is how we do it in the Midwest
