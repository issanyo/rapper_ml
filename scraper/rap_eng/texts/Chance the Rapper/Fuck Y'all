[Intro]
I'm so turned up right now, I'm on way past ten
Think we made it though, we almost made it though

[Bridge]
For anybody ever shitted on your dreams – fuck y'all
Hating niggas that was on your team – fuck y'all
Bitches that was caught up in the scene – fuck y'all
Now everybody say the same thing – fuck y'all

[Verse 1]
Been down this block before, I use to hustle on it frequently
Been working like a slave, tryna make sure all my peoples eat
Last year you wouldn't speak to me, but now you wanna freak with me
But I'ma still accept the pussy, cause it's just the creep in me
I do a lot of shit that I won't rap on, cause it's in the streets
It's morals over money, and it's silence over secrecy
Damn, how you just gon' act like I finna make it?
I'm thirsty on the ground, like big homie on that spaceship, yeah

[Hook]
I'm so turned up right now, I'm on way past ten
But I still gotta ways to go, we gotta ways to go, yeah
I'm so turned up right now, where should I begin?
I think we made it though, we almost made it though, yeah

[Verse 2]
I'm so close I can taste it and I'm not even wasted
Say what's up to my cult, we here to lead you out the matrix
We get gear by the cases, you still stuck on that fake shit
I roll the blunt and face it, cause I just couldn't take it
This shit don't even make sense, how could you even hate this?
But I guess I should thank them, cause that's just motivation
When I get an ovation, them goofies ain't gon' say shit
Except congratulations, it's funny, cause it's crazy
Like them niggas that was hating on your way up
Just know they gotta see you on their way down, straight up
And in the stereo, the only way that you can play us
It's Treated undefeated, and we comin' for them majors, bitch

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Chance the Rapper]
Touchdown, who you gon' trust now?
When you blow, spontaneous-ly combust now
Now they wanna fuck now, like you give a fuck now
You use to be an unknown, but now you one of us now
Go ahead and turn up, nigga, turn up
And all them brain cells, getting burnt up
In a furnace, don't concern us
With them problems of tommorow is a journey, turn up

[Hook]
