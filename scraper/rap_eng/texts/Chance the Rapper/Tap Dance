[Verse 1]
One foot in the door, one foot in the grave
One stepped on the floor, Two stepped out the way
Two glares up at one, whatcha wanna say?
One stares back at Two, Two is unafraid
Two steps up the stair, Two steps out the way
One smiles back at Two, now this shitâ€™s a race
Now they're skippin' steps, reps just get replaced
One-two one-one trip, something's in the way

[Hook]
Tap dance, syncopate
Tap dance, syncopate
Simulate, demonstrate tend to intimidate, wait
Tap dance, innovate, indicate, strategize, then you can syndicate

[Verse 2]
One is ashamed, crushed, ready to run back
Two looks to One, like, listen for once, that
Fall ain't your fault, dog, that was just one step
Always a tall wall, ladders and small steps
That's why you got me, leap, shuffle ball, step
We gone play leap frog. Paradiddle. Rep
Paradiddle. Rep. Single then both step

[Bridge 1]
One-two, one-two, one-two, one-two, step
One-two, one-two, step
One-two, one-two
I one-two, step, one-two
I one-two, step, one-two
One-two, one-two, step
One-two, one-two, step one

[Piano Interlude: Nate Fox & Peter Wilkins]

[Bridge 2]
Tap dance
When you tap dance
Tap dance
When you tap dance
Tap dance
Tap dance
Tap dance

[Interlude]
Tap dance, tap dance, tap dance
Tap dance, tap dance
One-two, one-two, one-two, one-two, one-two
One-two, one-two, one-two, one-two, one-two

One-two, one-two, step
One-two, step
One-two, ha
One-two, step
One-two, step
One-two, step
One-two, one-two, one-two
