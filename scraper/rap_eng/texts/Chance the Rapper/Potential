[Verse 1]
Introduce myself before I do the damage
Saying 'Hello World' like it's a coding language
If school doesn't work out, don't know how I'll manage
Trust your intuition 'for they go and take advantage

Nick Bee!
Better know that name homeboy
Man, leave that damn chrome toy
Back in your home and spread some joy

Ain't tryna be a preacher
But I'm reaching brand new grounds here
Still you should be treading lightly
If you ain't from round here

021 to 905, I'm on fire when i arrive
Both of em, gon' come alive when sun arise, I summarize
My past, moved so fast, a kid on the streets just hide and seeking
To a king of the beats, undefeated when competing and I'm teaming up with my meaning

And that meaning is to rhyme
Touch your spirit, make you cry
Make you laugh, get you mad
Or just simply blow your mind

Cause, this some of the best shit that you're hearing in a while
Imma keep experimenting with my bars in vials

[Hook]
It's been a while my friend, how you been?
Alotta time I've spent, tryna win
But I swear, when I start it I will finish
I will get right to the top, with the Lord as my own witness

Imma keep on climbing up
Ain't nobody gonna stop
For this man has gotta rock

I got potential in my mental you gotta believe
I got potential in my mental you gotta believe

[Verse 2]
Yeah I've dealt with broken hearts, like every man
And I've acted like a dusty mule, I carried them
But no hard feelings anyway, send away
Get away, no more games being played
Now I'm grounded couldn't find a single ounce of care

Stepped outside and I got lots of air
In my lungs, I'm feeling better I could bounce the hate
Reflect the bad when I neglect the sad
Up in affect my rap come through and wreck the map

Single pen and a piece of paper creating vapour
Ink is reaching boiling points and it is burning haters
Stuck up on their skin and now I got them tatted
My name is on their minds, they can't forget the one that matters

I follow patterns, to climb atop the music ladders
Rung by rung, every single song supports the latter
Hearing laughter from my friends bumping my craft it's
Kinda amazing my trail is blazing from that factor

[Hook]
It's been a while my friend, how you been?
Alotta time I've spent, tryna win
But I swear, when I start it I will finish
I will get right to the top, with the Lord as my own witness

Imma keep on climbing up
Ain't nobody gonna stop
For this man has gotta rock

I got potential in my mental you gotta believe
You got potential in my mental you gotta believe

[Outro]
They was talking "woo this woo wap da bam"
City so damn great, I feel like Alexand'
Wear your halo like a hat, that's like the latest fashion
I got angels all around me they keep me surrounded

Imma keep on climbing up
Ain't nobody gonna stop
For this man has gotta rock

I got potential in my mental you gotta believe
I got potential in my mental you gotta believe
