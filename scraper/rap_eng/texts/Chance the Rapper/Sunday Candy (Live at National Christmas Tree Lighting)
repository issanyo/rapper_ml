[Intro]
Happy holidays Mr President

[Verse 1: Chance]
She can say in her voice, in her way that she love me
With her eyes, with her smile, with her belt, with her hands, with her money
I am the thesis of her prayers
Her nieces and her nephews are just pieces of the layers
Only ones she love as much as me is Jesus Christ and Taylor
I got a feature so I'm singing for my grandma
You singing too, but your grandma ain't my grandma
Mine's is handmade, pan fried, sun-dried
Southside, and beat the devil by a landslide
Praying with her hands tied, president of my fan club, saying to her
Something told me I should bring my butt to church

[Hook: Jamila Woods]
You gotta move slowly
Take and eat my body like it's holy
I've been waiting for you for this whole week
I've been praying for you, you're my Sunday candy
You gotta move it slowly
Take and eat my body like it's holy
I've been waiting for you for this whole week
I've been praying for you, you're my Sunday candy

[Bridge: Jamila Woods (Chance) [Choir]]
Come on in this house, it's gonna rain
(Mama you know!)
Rain down Zion
(Rain down)
It's gonna rain
(Mama you know!)
[You gotta move slowly]
Rain down Zion, it's gonna rain
(Mama you know!)
(Mama you know!)

[Verse 2: Chance the Rapper]
I come to church for the candy, your peppermints is the truth
I'm pessimistic on Monday if I had tweaked and missed you
You look so good with that hat on, had to match with the shoes
Came and dressed in the satin, I came and sat in your pew
I come to Christmas for dinner, fifty rolls on my plate
Hella holes in my stocking holding your pockets in place
I like my love with a budget
I like my hugs with a scent
You smell like lights, gas, water, electricity, rent
You sound like why the gospel choir got so tired
Singin' his praises daily basis so I gotta try it
You're my dreamcatcher, dream team, team captain
Matter fact, I haven't seen you in a minute let me take my butt to church

[Bridge: Jamila Woods (Chance)]
You better come on in this house
(Come on in this house)
Cause it's gonna rain
(Mama you know it's gonna rain)
Rain down Zion
(Rain down)
It's gonna rain
(Mama you know it's gonna rain)
Come on down in this house
It's gonna rain
(Mama you know)
Rain down

[Interlude: Chance (Jamilla + Choir)]
Mama you know it's gon' rain
Father you know
(Rain down)
Promise you said it would rain
Finally I'm home
(Rain down)
You left on the light
When I left on a flight
But I made it alright
(Rain down)
I've been waiting all week
I've been waiting all night
(On me, rain down)
Baby, saving my life
Had to say something on Saturday
See you at church on Sunday
Open mic coming on Monday
I wonder what the Internet gon' say
When SNL end with the ending to the 3rd
Chance fly down the chimney
Me and Kiersten, Kensley, Lisa, Kenny, Taylor, Wendy all should win the Emmy
Momma should too!

[Bridge: Jamila Woods and Others]
Come on in this house, cause it's gonna rain
Rain down Zion, it's gonna rain
You better come on in this house, cause it's gonna rain
Rain down Zion, it's gonna rain
