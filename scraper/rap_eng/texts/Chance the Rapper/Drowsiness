[Intro: Sterling Hayes]

I see a lot of faces

[Verse 1: Sterling Hayes]
I see a lot of faces I don't know
Stay the fuck away from me bro
I'm still crying of granny
All my niggas got Grammys
Y'all fell over bitches and club VIP, stay away from me
She can't approach, I was lookin' lean
I'm really just tired of the lean
But I'm not sayin' I'm a nice guy
I see three fake niggas, nice try
Treat the one I love like shit
You can treat me the same way, it's okay
We can fight everyday
But don't walk away
It was all bad
I was in a deep, deep depression
At the time desperate for affection
And attention
I ain't know mistakes were lessons
Born in a bad home
Family all drug addicts
Gimme a bible and finna take a stab at it
Money don't make you happy
It ain't got no value, I ain't got value but...
If you smile I smile too
I'mma do some drugs I don't know what else to do

[Bridge 1]
Self righteous suicide
Self righteous suicide
How am I still alive
How am I still alive?

[Bridge 2]
When you got a problem
And canâ€™t nothing solve it
Grab a handgun and cock it
Aim it at your noggin
And Let it go (da na na na na)
Aim it at your noggin
Let it go (whoa)
Aim it at your noggin

[Verse 2: Chance The Rapper]
I got too much power
You watch too much power
You smoke too much sour
Take a shower
I'm a boss like Bowser
Get it from my bro like Algea
Did it in a row like Algea, that's nostalgia
Did it without ya, did it without ya
I call ya sofa cause so far
Youse a coucher, futon lounger
Send me a villain
Every episode you kenny krillin
Dying never doin' any killin'
Good riddance ain't no Henny spillin'
Been Benny the Bull can't pity the fool
Ain't no room for improvement when Timmy a tool
You can send him to school
Read him Winnie the Pooh
You could lead the horse to water but can't get in the pool
I wish all these niggas good luck
They gon' keep shooting they self in the foot
I made 35 J.J watt
I made 35 J.J whaaat

[Outro]
Give me something I can believe in
Steal my son and paint his face then call him Jesus
Track me down if I don't deliver
Break my bone and call me a nigga
Don't call me a nigga
Give me something I can believe in
Steal my son and paint his face then call him Jesus
Track me down if I don't deliver
Break my back and call me a nigga
Don't call me a nigga
