[Hook: Adele]
Round my hometown, memories are fresh
Round my hometown, oh the people I've met
Are the wonders of my world
Are the wonders of my world
Are the wonders of this world
Are the wonders now

[Verse 1: Chance The Rapper]
She say she wanna stay with the bloods and crips
Feel the front strips of inner city cliques
Where free cunt strips and young blood drips
And kids falls through the holes of hollow gun tips and
You wanna harm me, don’t try to call me
You ain’t gon’ bore me
Your slipping from my palm trees
Aw baby, baby please re-l-a-x
Together we about as fly as LAX
And, I don’t wanna hafta call you my ex
Well babe, I don’t wanna hafta call you collect
See, she say she got dreams to follow
How'm I ever be a man again she wants to be a model
My sunshine and light got stole away
Once the golden state took my gold away
Cali

[Hook: Adele]
Round my hometown, memories are fresh
Round my hometown, oh the people I've met
Are the wonders of my world
Are the wonders of my world
Are the wonders of this world
Are the wonders now

[Verse 2: Chance The Rapper]
You scold as you walk past him
No more truth laying we only talk sarcasm
Strutting, out there, need to be a model
Now you can catch me giving hickies to beer bottles
Get it? cause I’m kissing the neck, giving her heck
For whether not you give 'em respect
I know if you go, you just might blow
But if you leave, you can catch more than a cold
Bulimia, anorexia, you skip meals
You don’t make the cut, but that’s how your wrist feel
Conscript script slits in the hands of an actress
In the acting world you’ll find allies on the axis
You’ll find actresses in alleys on their backs
With directors giving oral in return for a practice

[Hook: Adele]
Round my hometown, memories are fresh
Round my hometown, oh the people I've met
Are the wonders of my world
Are the wonders of my world
Are the wonders of this world
Are the wonders now

[Verse 3]
Trees, trees please don’t leave
The trees will be changed, when it rains will they shelter you?
We was kissing under a tree when I fell for you
I thought that you was real
I guess I couldn’t tell the truth
Trees go knee deep in the dirt
They reach for the sky but they’re still down to earth
But you, you just leave like leaves in the autumn
Didn't think you would get on, get gone and just out them
Doubt them and reroute them not count them
I never leave you for the chance of an album
Your roots stay deeper, I can’t de-weed ya
I can’t walk away, away from this tree uh
And, as bad as I wanna see you running back
I could never ever ever be your lumberjack
Cali

[Outro: Adele]
Oh
Are the wonders of my world
Are the wonders of my world
Are the wonders of this world
Are the wonders of my world
