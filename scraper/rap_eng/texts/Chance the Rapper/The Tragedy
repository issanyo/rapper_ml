[Intro]
Oooh, snow is fallin'
Oooh, winter is callin'
Winter is callin' you, oooh
Oooh, snow is fallin'
Oooh, winter is callin'
Winter is callin' you, oooh, oooh

[Verse 1: Chance The Rapper]
Old man, sittin' on the corner
Old man, been there for years
Old man, weepin' on the corner
Tryna find what's his
Old man weepin' in the corner
Cold again, it snowed again
Old man waitin' by the corner
Waitin' on winter again
He needs help
He needs help
He needs Heaven
He needs Heaven
Old man waitin' by the corner
Old man drinkin' by the corner
Tryna find somewhere warmer
Some place that he can get warmer tonight
Winter's coming
Winter's coming
Old man sittin' on the corner
Tryna find what's his

[Verse 2: Noname]
When I was your craving and only this mattered
This jingle bell sanctified, sugared in batter
Our heathenous appetite, ever and after
Like Christmas will save us and bathe us in rapture
Mr. Happy, Mr. Matrimony
Mr. Half-A-Block-Away-From-Stony
I love you
There's something hauntin', dauntin' 'bout your presence
Casper essence, ghost of Christmas past
Phantom of unraveling his laugh
Opera, string quartet
Curtain's up, but the whole room darkened up
I know winter was callin' you
Me baby, my baby
He Chris with the Kringle in rooms filled with ladies
They lovin' his presence, a blessin' a blessin'
I'm guessin' you happy
I'm knowin' you answered
When winter was callin' you
