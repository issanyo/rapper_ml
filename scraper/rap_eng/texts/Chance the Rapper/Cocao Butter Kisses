Take a piss, na na, na na .........

Cigarettes on cigarettes, my mama think I stank
I got burn holes in my hoodies, all my homies think it's dank
I miss my cocoa butter kisses
I miss my cocoa butter kisses

Pull up in a huggy, Startsky & Hutch a dougie
I just opened up the pack, in an hour, I'll ash my lucky
Tonight, she just yelling 'fuck me'
Two weeks ,she'll be yelling fuck me
Used to like orange cassette tapes with Timmy, Tommy and Chuckie
Oh Chuck E. Cheese's pizza, Jesus pieces, sing Jesus love me
Put Visine inside my eyes so my grandma would fucking hug me
Generation above me, I know you still remember me
My afro look just like daddy's, y'all taught me how to go hunting

Cigarettes on cigarettes, my mama think I stank
I got burn holes in my hoodies, all my homies think it's dank
I miss my cocoa butter kisses
But I'll think we're all addicted
Think we're all addicted
Oh yes I know we're all addicted
Think we're all addicted
Know we're all addicted

Everybody's somebody's everything (know your worth)
And nobody is nothing nobody no, no, no
Everybody's somebody's everything (know your worth)
Nobody is nothing, that's right
