If you ain’t on shit, if you tryna shmoke
You can hit my line, you can hit my line

I guess I'll file the cabinets, fix the disha washa

Tonight (fancy attire)
On the sofa posted perfect selfie picture posture
Tonight (Snapchat bitch)

If you ain’t on shit, if you tryna shmoke
You can hit my line, you can hit my line

[Verse 3]

Only dust and shadows comin' from la cucaracha tonight
