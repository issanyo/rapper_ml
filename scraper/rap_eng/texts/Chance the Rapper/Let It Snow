[Chorus: Jeremih]
North Face cold, let it snow
Rollie goals, let it snow
Say she cold, come on home
Let it go, let it snow
Where the hoes? Let's go sleigh
Door to door, not Mary Kay
Got some Js, that's on the way
Tree lit up, Christmas Day

[Verse 1: Jeremih]
Oh I love this Christmas time again
Snowed in and we dining in
Plenty love, Valentine's and them
Bout to make yo ass mine's again
Ice you down, let me try again
Snow winters can we flying in
Sound like the wind chiming in
Love songs, check the time again
Play around no skips
Mistletoe, your lips
I don't know St. Nick
But I got your gifts, don't trip
We can't but help the forecast
More love and more laughs
Tell your ex to let it go
And let it snow, let it snow

[Chorus: Jeremih & Chance the Rapper]
North Face cold, let it snow
Rollie goals (Rollie goals), let it snow (let it snow)
Say she cold (she cold), come on home (come on home)
Let it go, let it snow
Where the hoes? (where the hoes?) let's go sleigh (let's go sleigh)
Door to door (Door to door), not Mary Kay (Mary Kay)
Got some Js, that's on the way (that's on the way)
Tree lit up (tree lit up), that's Christmas Day (Christmas day)

[Verse 2: Chance the Rapper]
Canada Goose
Daddy threw Santa the oop, land on the roof
Cut up some cantaloupe just for lil Kensli the world
Can't love you, I'm not a plant I'm the root
The world love my fruit, had a cup of my juice
Nigga, I'm still free, tell me how much is you?
Black folk at the show, black car at the store
Black love ya if you love me, black heart if you don't
Black power, black privilege, my kids'll never go broke
Black party, black party, the kids just said they gonna vote
Black business, black Friday, they salty
Scared of going broke, scared it's gonna snow

[Chorus: Jeremih & Chance the Rapper]
North Face cold, let it snow
Rollie goals (rollie goals), let it snow (let it snow)
Say she cold (she cold), come on home (come on home)
Let it go, let it snow
Where the hoes? (where the hoes?) Let's go sleigh (let's go sleigh)
Door to door (door to door), not Mary Kay (Mary Kay)
Got some Js, that's on the way (that's on the way)
Tree lit up (tree lit up), that's Christmas Day (Christmas day)
