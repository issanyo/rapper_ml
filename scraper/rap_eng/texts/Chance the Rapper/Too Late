I just started rolling I just filled my lungs up
I just pour my cup out I just my spilled my blunt guts
All these bitches done up, my niggas a hundred
And we rolling them up and keep pouring it up
It’s too late for them but it’s not for us
I just started rolling I just filled my lungs up
I just pour my cup up I just my spilled my blunt guts
All these bitches done up, my niggas a hundred
Know we pouring it up and keep rolling up
It’s too late for them but its not for us

[Chance The Rapper]
Like my women like my liquor, no light go dark
Faded like a wide Mohawk
Girl, I know you know me I'm with Michael Rocks
You could j in the middle like Michael Fox
Oh you're Chi? Me too go Sox, go Hawks
Go Katie, go Tink, Go Hard
We can live luxe do a lap go-cart
On chief on your mark get ready go start
Ooh a nigga geeked up, look at all these D cups
Ooh a nigga classy, Lean all in my tea cup
Damn that Saki sneak up, look how fast two weeks up
Yall tweaked, two weeks too weak
I'm free to freely twist up
Hahaha at you goofy ass niggas, foofoo ass niggas
Roy Ayers like "Who that nigga?" #AcidRap for you smooth jazz niggas
Thick hoes wanna juke that nigga
And everybody else wanna shank you
Breaking ankles with Banco
It’s a little too late quite frankly no thank you

[Sir Michael Rocks]
I'm one on one with your favorite lady
I'm in her house like central air
I’m in her hair and between her legs
I can’t lick that shit if there’s pimples there
If there’s no taste and there’s nothing there
Get my gold plate and my silverware
You pick up tabs and pay her bills
And take her kids to Build-A-Bear
Ain’t no cutting corners in the winner circle
So motherfucka you still a square
My nigga got the blue Louis Vuitton iguanas
Givenchy kinda played but it’s still ok
Man I dream of money when I fall asleep
There’s hundred dollar bills in the pillow case
My nigga Choosey gone who gon fill his space
Who gon fill his shoes you can't run his race
My money, my hundy is on my k
I don’t want it I hit it that’s all I take
I’m on liquor I’m leaning but I'm ok
I don’t kick it with niggas cuz all y’all fake
I mean my homies my homies my niggas my niggas
We cannot be split up cuz that’s how they get us
The pick of the litter the diamonds the glitter
All of this cheddar we trying to get rid of
