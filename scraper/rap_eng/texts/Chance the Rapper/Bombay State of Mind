[Verse 1: Uno Hype]
I used to get a lotta love, homie knew what it was
Till' I hit em' with the strug, got a lil' buzz
Forever smoking indo, forgetting all of this info
And most of it was simple, really cause of my mental
Steadily spitting riddles
Making niggas giggle with that weak shit
You lame niggas can't see this
Cutting up like a fetus, whoa
Look into my eyes yeah they can see the hope
Can't see the whole, but it's not my destination
The top is what I'm cravin'
Success is what I bathed in
Watch they screaming praise his name dog it's amazing
All the faces changing from the bills to the haters
Get out the way homie, can you do me a favor
Leave them dudes watching as I go to the top and
They gon' stop mocking, and I'mma start plotting
Cause they mind boxed-in keep spitting
I got the flow to unlock it
No one they saw this cotton
You ain't built like that, I suggest you niggas stop it

[Hook] x4
It's the champagne pourin'
Bombay sippin', bombay sippin' bom-bombay sippin'

[Verse 2: Hassani Kwess]
Bombay
Bombay
Ha, H-Kwess
Uh, what you thought it was
Nigga started this morning out with a awful buzz
Kicks and punan
Chilling on my arm cover yo mouth when you yawn
It's nasty like ya homegirl wakin' up off the futon
Lookin' good in my ball shorts
Wearin' bangles all sorts
And yo girl got my grey Georgetown crew on
Check it at the do' ho
The Kwess be on the dolo
Hittin emcees solo put em' on the entree
What you sippin'? (Bombay)
What you tippin'? (Bombay)
A bad boy since Big but my mission Andre
We gettin' paper in case loads
Rupee yens and pesos
Euro pounds casino chips
Dippin' in my queso
Niggas come get buck wit' us
Take a girl to fuck wit' us
Kicked the beat, fucked it up
And told the beat to toughen up
Let me get em, hm
How shall I rock thee (What's ya name?)
H-Kwess from the Bombay posse

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Chance the Rapper]
Screaming, "Burn it down!"
Too loud, too dank for you to turn it down
Bad bitches runnin' 'round like shirtless now
Shit's just perfect now
When it's worth it why the fuck would I get nervous now?
So shop with me on Mary
And fuck with me on Sherrif
Puttin' caramel on Garrett's
Yellin', "Fuck the Heat on Derrick"
I'm a city based n-word, 27's, Port's, and spirit's
Been trying to share that dinner
Can't inherit from your parents
#Igh
I was rollin' a blunt when I wrote this
I was smokin' a blunt when I spoke this
Hocus pocus, how's that for a smoke trick
Couldn't pay attention now I can afford focus
Got a lil' buzz and they got fuckin' bogus
Like how you gonna swat a flying locust?
But it's actually dope...
Acid, adderall, and adjectives
An adolescent I could fuck with?
#Igh's his fuckin' ad-lib?
Burn, burn, city we built
You already forgot the names of kids that we killed
Burn, burn, it's hot as all fuck
Cause everyone got burner
Cause it's always gettin' buck
Igh

[Verse 4: Freeway]
Okay
My girl loves to party all the time
Always mad at me
Probably cause I'm always on my grind
I ain't know she swiped a million on the cards [?]
Shopping at the mall, showing off
All cause of my hard
Work, work, work, work
We grindin'
Work, work, work
We gotta
Work, work
Network to get work
Get work to network
Increase my net worth
Get on my feet first and then feed the streets
With that team early heat
And then we get that neck to work
Day in, day out
Staying in no hangin' out
In the studio like Em and Dre
Like MMA we bring em' out
Mix that, put it out
Video then radio
Then after the show make the girl get her neck to work
Main girl, ex-girl
Please em' no X pill
Yes I'm a model
Watch the exert, expert
Perform some new songs
See if I can get that to work
We shut the show down and then we get back to work
Work hard, party harder
More dough let us party longer
Overseas we party yonder
Never rap and we get this cheese

[Hook]
