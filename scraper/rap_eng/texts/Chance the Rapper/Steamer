[Intro]
Steamer(6x)

[Verse 1: Chance The Rapper]
SAVEMONEY, hot still
Nice car, don't got deal
Don't got bread, just got whip
That hot shit, them hot wheels
Hot wire, no license mate
Ridin' round with your license plate
Tan color, that iced cake
Same year as that '98
Same ear that Mike Tyson ate
Bitch comin', and the steamer gotta stop
Hide and seekin' with the cops, middle finger to the opps
And the Nina in the crotch, in the Beamer hella leanin'
Lickin' whips from niggas tweakin' and then leave em in the lot
And I hop in the top of the drop top convert, top off, ha
In a four door Volvo screaming "fuck you, like , YOLO!" Hol' up!
(Vic: That shit's dangerous, man, fuck that shit)

[Verse 2: Vic Mensa]
Go ahead nigga hot wire that shit
Come and bring it through the hood, stop by in that bitch
If a nigga wanna go and stop riding that shit
Leave it up the block, let the cops find that shit
Little SAVEMONEY niggas not givin' no fucks
Where the keys, lil nigga, gone give 'em on up
Ridin' d's, lil nigga, chrome shit on that truck
Pretty please, my nigga, for a nigga get stuck
When you...ridin' your steamer, uh
I don't know what you been told
But ain't nothin' better than stacking your cheddar
In a broke down steamer that you done stole
No air conditioning, too damn cold
Go steal that whip and then do that blow
Out here, still tippin', done flew that light
That knife just to fixin' [with Kami] to cuchero

[Verse 3: KAMI]
Black mask and that crowbar
That's my whip, not yo car
That's my bitch, not yo broad
Screaming "fuck the opps!", it be no law
Two niggas in front, five bitches in back
Seven niggas ridin' strapped in that candy Cadillac
Sweet all in my scraper, in that steamer blowing vapor
With a lining and a taper, saving paper, see you later
So it's duck sauce on them pigs nigga!
Tricks out, so pimp nigga!
No room for them simps wit cha
Drop top with them tints dimmer
Rollin' with the famo, it be massa and the Chano
Pumping purple, tucking Camels
Got the money on the panel
Flippin' switchers, switchin' channels
For the high speed chase
But it's power to the hemi when I sip V8
Out chyeah

[Verse 4: Tokyo Shawn]
Ridin' 'round, all up in my scrape, movin' that weight
Tryna see that money I'mma make, m-move the decimal place
If a hater talking shit, okay, bang
Like a hurt leg, boy, you don't wanna play
You ain't safe 'round here, don't nobody got a cape
And I'm ridin' round bright and early, ridin' dirty
With that purple on me like a Vikings jersey
Just checked my mirror, goddamn I'm perty
So I'm all in my steamer like Stanley
Passenger seat, eye candy
Clean face, no acne, never catch me lacking
Got it hidden in the back seat
If you want it, come and get at me
SAVEMONEY

(break in song)

[Verse 5: Brian Fresco]
Peep you, lame-lame ass nigga with a sweet coupe
Creep through, no mask nigga, better keep cool
Got five seconds 'fore a nigga crease you
Hit a lick, now his whip be the steamer
Low-low to the earth, so the cops can't beam him
Ain't-ain't nobody seen him, in the chop shop schemin'
Hopped out the phone booth, lil nigga hella gleamin'
Rollin' and smokin' and smokin' and rollin'
Got molly for bitches who get with the motion
My niggas be holdin', yo niggas be foldin'
I'm shooting with range, so hop out that Rover
SAVEMONEY takeover, don't think this shit kosher
This handle'll knock you straight out of your loafers
My bitch, she the coldest, from over the border
We got what you need, just tell me the order
We makin' a quarter, b-bitch nigga posted up
S-s-stole yo whip, he boxed it up
Hundred blunts, donuts
Nigga stole yo whip, did a hundred stunts
Sold yo stereo for a hundred bucks
Want beef? Nigga call up a hundred guns
I be chillin', smokin' stank, like a hundred bums
Play rough, nigga, I will let this rumper? hum
Yeah
(Steamer)
