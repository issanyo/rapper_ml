[Verse 1: D Bridge]
Uh, everyday I fold my hands together
And ask the Lord to please help me mold these plans together
Cause I can't do it alone, it's true that I'm on a mission
My vision is vivid and [?]
Only opticians can see that I'm gifted
Like yuletide, just a cool guy
Sitting poolside in my imagination
Watch a dream unfold, I done dreamed so long
Down to scheme with my team 'til the green don't fold
It ain't a pipe dream no mo'
Oh no, so I'mma go, one step at a time
I'm next up in line, I guess I'm defined by reppin what's mine
I reckon my time is approachin' (is approachin')
That's what I'm hopin' (that's what I'm hopin')
And I pray that my career is never folding (never folding)
Like origami, I'm posted with Imani
Cause the verse is picture perfect
And to let you know we grindin'
Cause life is hard, but pain is mental
So while y'all making paper planes, I'm chasing this paper, playing it simple
Ha, swear y'all should put me in the hall of fame
Cause life and art is all the same
And when it unfolds, my legacy will be flawless mane

[Hook: D. Bridge]
So, so, so, fuck you just pay me
There's no ifs, buts or maybes
And dont look at me crazy
Come on, try all you want
But know that you'll never phase me, beat me, or play me
So listen when I tell you Im on
Cause Im on, Im on, Im on
Yeah Im on, Im on, Im on
So, so, so I know you see me shining
I won't fold like origami
Cause my whole city behind me, fo'sho

[Verse 2: Gerald Walker]
I just kept on saying "yes," as they kept on saying "no"
So nigga don't compare me to the rest
Cause when they stop, that's when I go
So nigga you know
You're now listening to the one of the realest that ever would do it
Them niggas that shot, won a fortune then blew it
Put your middle fingers up if you tired of the foolish songs
And the shit that these other niggas biten
Always told "remain humble," nigga who the fuck we kiddin'?
Tell the world that we down to bring it back
All the lyrics that they lack
So I suggest you niggas pay attention
So if it's a clique or a gang full of niggas
Or whether I'm doing this shit on my own
I've never been scared to do this shit alone
It's real nigga shit, mothafucka should'a known
And I'm never the type to come snap, rap, and dance
Wait on another or sit on my hands
[?] in this stuff and you might get a shot
No time to be scared, just piss in your pants
Just understand, it's only a matter of time before they know me
Girl to slow me, and my homies, get up on me
Like they know me, they control me
Listen closely, I don't need a bunch of phonies tryna own me
Maybe stone me or dethrone me
Rather stay by myself and be lonely
Still doin' the tune
No matter who in the room or who in the building
No matter who close the show
You can ask the party people who stole it though
They know

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Chance The Rapper]
Fo'sho, fo'sho, fo'sho, fo'sho, fo'sho, fo'sho
IGH! Chance? The Rapper? IGH! IGH!
Run up in your spot like
Give me that spotlight, that limelight
Rhyme like light skin Marshall
Artist crucial, superfarcial
Caution, the kids is in the van, it's like a super carpool
My shoes is stupid awful, rose gold my tulips purple
Pass the piff, pacifist or a fist
Or a kiss, or kids, orifice
Nothing rhymes with oranges
Little illeterate, run from the litter
Deliver the faith that we had in you gone
Origami oracles, paper tell my fortune
People told me once before, that everything's gon' blow up
You can make a crane or plane
Dependin' how you fold it (IGH!)
