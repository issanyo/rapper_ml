I rain, I rain, I rain, I rain

[Verse 1: Rapsody]
Penny for a beggar, beg to differ
These just my lonely thoughts that sometimes get off with some liquor
So I don't drink so much no more at war wit my own picture
What you thought it was? Cuz I ain't perfect as the dove in scriptures
Tight as two sisters but my favorite color black
They say the color purple royal soil on my back
From the war that I been fighting just to make it off the map
I was waiting for the sun to set, they intrigued with my black
I guess the pitch is like my soul
Worn out just like my Fo's
I took the blue pill yesterday
The key to all my goals
Going over songs we like and songs we don’t
Don't wanna fall short as the gnomes and I have yet to visit Rome
24 inches how we used to dream of chrome
Last year my sister moved from New Orleans and she ain't need no loans
We light up like the scones when talkin money trees
How you don't eat pork but smoke holy on tobacco? Weed
I never breath, another breed, Q, Phife, Ali Shaheed
Check the rhyme It's just my time to kill It like the purge this spring
Deep as the valleys in the Philippines and up in Cali
They say this tape is like an album
Threw one in the galaxy all for free
Magna carter I been part of
My independent ass motherfucker they couldn't water
Down look around the takeover dun took over
And we been doing shit that you average rapper can't shoulder
So, what's next I suspect your death
Welcome to the game where we trained to never follows refs
Lot of great players, but we as better as a team
You learned that watching Miami and the spurs just this spring
Scary as the ring in the well
On the scale I weigh like the Bronson or Adele
I'm shell as full jacket metal
Madame I replicated the summer of Sam, damn
Kill at ran-damn (random) Im like Van Damm stuck in a dam
Damn, who is the killa? Wit agility
Flow bend like that around Anguilla
Got the skill of thriller
Came from underground to get a mill or Two
Everyday I've wrote, it seemed to wanna rain a few
I guess I'll reign for you, Philly to NY
Just to wet you up I’m tear ducts to a dry eye
My my what he told me reciting OBI, Kenobi
“you'll be the death of me solely”
I told him showly, I agree I'm Ali, cross um like Doji
Sting like wasps I serve um losses they lowley
Call me young achilles cuz I snap on these like Kobe Now
Back to talking bout my day it went smoothly
I woke up hella early, last night watched a movie
And compared it to my life like 2-D boobies, the come up, like the sun up, when ya son up mornings crying for juices
Adolescents
Never stress um
Developed I bless um
Denaun thanks for the blessing
One of the best in the game
I still remain, outside still writing in the rain, I reign

[Bridge: Chance the Rapper]
Why don't you come home at night no more, no more
Why can't you see past a thing, no more

[Verse 2: Chance the Rapper]
Yeah I see the gun but it's a pellet
Yeah the ball is in your court, but it's appellate
They sayin Acid was an album retail it
I said I got way too much soul for me to sell it
That's why godfather tied the cape on my shoulders
Said save em from false prophets and wolves in sheeps' clothing
I'm a little too hard to be slept on
I'm a little too sharp to be stepped on
A little too Pac for the septum
I'm so pretty I make mirrors blush
I spit the shit in a party to make your ear adjust
I'm a parapalegic parrot with a pair of crutches in a no fly zone
On the phone talking bout how Bush trying to disparage us
There's a metaphor if I expound
There's a better score in the next round
Me and raps go together like donuts and fresh ground
Coffee, I'm awfully softly spoken
In Autumn, fall leaf clovin
My posters on dry wall and my banners are star spangled
My demons get charred, mangled, Chancelor the Archangel
I don't pray for chart singles
I grab life by the ankle like Kurt Angle
And ask it if it's ticklish
Ask me if that's ridiculous
I'm a meticulous fickle dude
That just happens to spit a little bit
And you can tell I rapped this off my phone
Cause you can hear that ringtone in the background but I'm in the zone
