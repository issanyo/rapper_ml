[Bridge x2]
You feel me deep down, you got me so quick
You mess me around, I'll be taking that shit
You hold me so tight, I'm singing so sweet
To fill me with light to the tip of my feet

Uh yeah
And I'll be yours for the night
Tell me what you wanna do!
Do anything you like
All my thoughts are focused on you
Wanna' let you know
I'm never gonna let you go
Keep doing me right
You make me feel like

[Hook]
You're the only one I believe in
Nothing ever get in my way
If distance puts a little time between us
You say "baby your worth the
Wait"
Just remember how much I please ya
Don't forget the next time I see ya
All night long, you gon' be an ecstasy, eh oh

[Bridge x2]

Oh yeah
And I'll be yours for the night
Say what you wanna, say what you wanna
Do anything you like
Do what you're gonna, do what you're gonna
Wan' let you know
I'm never gonna let you go
Keep doing me right
You make me feel like

[Chance the Rapper]
IGH!
Chance? The Rapper?
Damn baby, why you smell so good? (IGH!)
Why yo nails in my back always felt so good? (IGH!)
Why you so deep? Why you spell so good? (IGH!)
Why when you make me a grilled cheese, the cheese melt so good?
Why don't y-o-u and I fly off to Dubai
So I can dive in your bayou, thought of buying you the sky
I (IGH!) love you like gramma love Jesus
Like Jesus love you, like pews love preachers
Like Ozzie loved Ruby, like Ruby loves Gator
But Gator loved rock, like rock does paper (IGH!)
You gone be the death of me, my negative necessity (IGH!)
My medicine, my holy sin (IGH!), I'm rolling on your ecstasy (IGH!)
Dance, girl, drop it, shake it (IGH!)
Pop that back until you break it (IGH!)
Slow pop, pretend your naked (IGH!)
You're the one, oh you're my baby (IGH!)
(Tinashe: You make me feel like)

[Hook]

You hold me so...
(Hold me so tight, You feel me with light)
You feel me deep down, and you got me so quick
You hold me so tight
You sing me to sleep (sing me to sleep)
Fill me with light
