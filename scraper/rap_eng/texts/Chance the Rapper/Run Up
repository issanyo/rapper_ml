Chance The Rapper
IGH

Y'all know where to find me
102 nigga behind me
Y'all can't get that solo
But all my niggas on grimy
And all my niggas on slimy
All these lames wan fight me
I heard they at my head ?
Nigga come try me

Nigga don't Run Up Igh
(Don't run up)
Nigga don't Run Up
(Don't run up)

[That Guy Freaky Ty]
Run up on me and that would be a bad move
Record you getting punched in and I ain't talking ProTools
I'm low-key like riding in your girl
Competest if you want and you will end up on World Star
Getting your ass beat bitch nigga you weak
Pussy nigga you sleep
Me, I am Unique
High as fuck off the loud
Damn I reek
Focused on this money trying to get a mill like Meek nah
Trying to get mills Like General nah no Cereal

Do you copy Joe I suggest you listen or somebody might find your ass while they fishin Before you fuck with me think twice nigga think think Know [?] carry that 6 piece bink, bink, bink, bink, bink, bink!

Y'all know where to find me
102 nigga behind me
Y'all can't get that solo
But all my niggas on grimy
And all my niggas on slimy
All these lames wan fight me

Young guns got thumper

Don't pump faker the pumper
Son's of Joe Kony
Resemble the rastas
Can't trust your brother the family of mobsters
Hasta la Vista Casa la lisa
You're not invited the pitbulls might eat ya
Shame on my teacher and Shame on the students for killing my classmates these pupils is ruthless
Savings on schedule checks my to-do list and they want my scraps fuck wrong with you you foolish
My Cricket, my flash drive, like is you going to use this they thristy I'm swinging they uzi I'm oozing
Daddy said fall alone ain't no need to gangbang so all I got is bink bink and all they do is bang bang shit that make you cherish lives
They leave you paralyzed and with the paramedics for a pair of Js from Paradise

Y'all know where to find me
102 nigga behind me

And all my niggas on slimy
