[Intro: Chance the Rapper + The Dells]
All
All, all, all
All the things
All the things, things
All that glitters is not gold
All, all, all, and all gold is not reality
Real is what you lays on me
How's everybody doing?

[Pre-Verse]
We were all that matters, family's all that matters
This is just business, see you right after
Nothing comes before ya, nothing else matters
All of this is for ya, you are all that matters

[Verse]
I dance around the darkness down on Billie Jean Road
If I ain’t toured then we still’d be broke
Thought I got the formula, bon appetite
I got a beat in case my baby baba ever leak
Wise beyond my years but way behind my peak
You gotta eat, this a step to my princess
Point of interest, fourth and inches
Hallelujah, the kid grew up, the crowd cheered the child
Booya, mic drop, I walk home

[Hook: Macie Stewart & Teddy Jackson (Chance the Rapper & Sample)]
I don't care about, they don't mean a thing (All, all)
All these fancy things (All, all)
I'll tell you that all, my weight in gold (All)
All I know, I know (And all gold is not reality)
All these things
All these things
All these things
All these things

[Break: Chance the Rapper]
In this part of my life, I'm growing up and I- and I wanna, I wanna do this the right way, go, go out of it, grow out of it, in the best way possible, so thank you guys who's been there thus far, and it's only gonna get better...

[Hook: Chance the Rapper, Macie Stewart, & Teddy Jackson (Chance the Rapper & Sample)]
I don't care bout, they don't mean a thing
All these fancy things
I'll tell you that all, my weight in gold (All that glitters, glitters)
All I know, I know (Is not gold, Igh!)
All these things (All that matters)
All these things (All, all that matters)
All these things (You are all that matters)
