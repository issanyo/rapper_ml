I got too much power
You watch too much Power
You smoke too much sour, take a shower (take a shower)
I'm a boss like Bowser
Get it from my bro like Al Ja'
Did it in a row like [? :59]
That's nostalgia
Did it without ya, did it without ya
I thought you sofa' cause so far you's a couch or futon lounger
Semi-villain, every episode you Kenny Krillin
Dyin', never doin' any killin'
Good riddance, ain't no Henny spillin
Been Benny the Bull can't pity the fool
Ain't no room for improvement when Timmy a tool
You can send him to school read him Winnie the Pooh
You can lead a horse to water but can't get in the pool
I will show these niggas good luck
They gone keep shootin' theyselves in the foot
I made 35, JJ Watt
I made 35, JJ, what?
