[Verse 1: Kelsey]
On my own two feet
I'm back in control
In the driver's seat with what I say goes
And I can't slow down
I won't hold back
(yeah x4)

[Hook: Kelsey]
This night is magical, beautiful, electrifying
And I am letting go
Getting closer to flying
This room is fading fast
Make it last, Hold it closer
Once I cross that finish line, baby
I'll be out of sight
(yeah x4)
Out of sight
(yeah x4)

[Verse 2: Kelsey]
Got no reason why
My heart says go
Got no time to cry
I should let you know
I won't slow down
I can't hold back
(yeah x4)

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Chance The Rapper]
Chance, The Rapper
It's like oh my, my heart bleeding for ya
It's like oh my, but it's hardly over
I'm spittin' over-seas, plane taking off, I leave
Got me picking off leaves of my four-leaf clover
Like She love me not, she love me lot
So all of these hoes, babe, I just crush a lot
Like hella' flights, hella' nights, out of spite
Gotta' learn to trust your boy even though I'm out of sight

[Hook: Kelsey]
