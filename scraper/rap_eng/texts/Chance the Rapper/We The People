[Verse: Chance the Rapper]

We want some heroes in our story
We need highlights for a night light
We need glory for a while
We want results, we want results
Hit our families, hit our folks, bombs bursting in air

Oh, say, can you see America face?
We share a pair of parents, took good care of the place
We just want narrators to pick up the narrative's pace
Put on a show for us, float for us
Make it easy, make some mo' for us
Save the day

We want a W, we tired of picking different sides
I got your jersey, just a different size
We all want you to be a buzzer beater
Find us a leader far from Silent Bob's and Cousin Skeeter's
Through the perilous fight, want you to be brave
We want us a hero, we need a teammate

[Hook: Chance the Rapper] x 2

People, people
We the people would like you to know
That wherever you go, we're right by your side
People, people
We the people would like you to know
That wherever you go, we're right by your side

[Hook: Chance the Rapper & James Fauntleroy]

People, people
We the people would like you to know
That wherever you go, we're right by your side
