[Intro]
Yo Java, we all praying for you my brother
This one's for you

[Verse]
Dear summer, what you been on with my friends
You a snake throwin' all types of salt in the plants
And every weekend it get a little worse
Thinking everybody's homies [?]
Puttin faces on the bullets and the six chambers
But in our faces is the faces in the newspapers
You provide the summer nights, Drake provide the soundtrack
We provide the pockets and they heads make us bounce back
And you gotta answer soon as the triggers call
Tired of posting "rest in peace" on my niggas' walls
Too many cops with the aims on 'em
Too many spray painted t-shirts with little niggas names on 'em
And I'm sure that a little came from anger
But mostly cause niggas ain't afraid to up banger
And maybe I need a geography class or something
But when did Chicago become a part of East Compton?
And when did Windy City mean we'll blow you all away?
And when did throwing hands become the hoish move to play?
Around the time when killing cops became the route to follow
And a bullet on your plate became the Taste of Chicago, uh!
But you held it down for my niggas this season
Cause everybody see 'em and out here chiefing
And we all got plug, but we don't really need 'em
Hamburger helper, got the gloves if you beefin'
Put your weapons down, drop 'em if you keep 'em
Throw them hands and I'll throw your mans in the deep end
Throw a party every week and every single weekend
Summer's almost over but you do it kinda decent
And this one here is for the ave
And all my homies pouring memories out of caskets made of glass
Til we walk on streets completely made of O.E
Shout out to North Ave and Oak Street
And Tinley park and Tuley park and also Morgan Park
Chicago paints a picture that is more than art
We all fear for fall to have to show up
So summer lets us never have to grow up
Chicago summers
