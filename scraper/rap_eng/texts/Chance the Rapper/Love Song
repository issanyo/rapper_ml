[Kaden Butler: Verse 1]
I love you so much that my heart is about to burst
I think you noticed that right at the first verse
When I texted you for the first time
My world just came alive
And...you made my presence shine
Just like a rhyme on the day it was valentine
I remember the day that you forgot your purse
I loved the way we met, the way you liked to curse
Said you had to go to work
Did not say thanks, that kind of hurt
I drove you all the way home
You did not say a word, you were reading Ethan Frome
We pulled up to the house in silence
The dog next door was causing some motherfucking violence
But goddam, I love you anyway
Do you have to go, it is only the 17th of May
Ignore them I am not motherfucking gay
So, you pulled me against the wall
Hold up, can you hear Santa Clause call?
LETS GO TO THE MALL!!!
And now you are acting like a hoe
Ho, ho, ho Merry Christmas
Ho, ho, ho-e Babe-Mas

[Chorus: Jordan Busza]
For you girl, i'd break the law
For you girl, i'd fight jaws
In my eyes you are perfect
In every way there's no flaws
Like a diamond, you'd be shining
Even when you are not trying
And you know I keep it real, there's no need to be lying

[Verse 2: Lynn Lyon]
You never said your parents are artist
Because you truly are a masterpiece
I know you said you're flawless
But this is something I have to repeat
You my everything I love you from head to feet
And that's no weird fetish, that's just me being me
Even with all the lettuce, even with all the green
Money can't but me happiness, something only your could bring
You're the moon and I'm the night, you're the love and I'm the fight
I'm the wrong and you're the right and just like the sun we know you shine bright

[Chorus: Jordan Busza]
For you girl, i'd break the law
For you girl, i'd fight jaws
In my eyes you are perfect
In every way there's no flaws
Like a diamond, you'd be shining
Even when you are not trying
And you know I keep it real, there's no need to be lying

[Verse 3: Lynn Lyon]
Like the saying goes, there's no us without trust
On the realest I think there's more to love than just lust
And if you feel it, your know that is more than just a crush
And when you hear it, I bet your cheeks turn red when you blush
Wait do you hear it? It's my heart
And it beats fast when we touch
I need your love because baby I just can't get enough
How do you want it, I could stroke it soft or just rough
2 in the morning, I could slow it then speed up
I'll have you moaning, go to school remembering the rush
Friends ask about yesterday, and you reply nothing much
Then change the subject, and ask what they for their lunch

[Chorus: Jordan Busza]
For you girl, i'd break the law
For you girl, i'd fight jaws
In my eyes you are perfect
In every way there's no flaws
Like a diamond, you'd be shining
Even when you are not trying
And you know I keep it real, there's no need to be lying
