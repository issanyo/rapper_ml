[Intro]
Thanks for filming this
I wrote this for you today
Chano A.K.A. Mr. Windy City
Remix!

[Verse]
I got the baddest chick on the planet
She ain't mixed but folks be askin' if she half Hispanic
She complain about the baby weight but I ain't panicked
Since she got pregnant she been showin' crack like bad mechanics
I rub her feet, I put in work like I was Robyn Fenty
The only chick that I hold as much is probably Kinsley
I sit with her and watch Black Ink and Being Mary
But never Love & Hip Hop, that shit get kinda scary
She stand about six feet, she used to hoop at 'Lane
I tried to stick her the other day and got my ankle sprained
I fell deep, tried to leave, but you know the way that you learn best
Is leavin' out the garage and get hit with that U-turn text
So if you got a girl and she sexy and she grown
Stay your ass at home 'fore you end up all alone
Leave the toilet seat down, always keep your phone
Ask my BM, she got her own ringtone, and she was singing...
