[Intro: Chance The Rapper & Raphaelle Standell-Preston]
You don't, you don't need no one
You don't, you don't need no one
You don't, you don't need no one
Say you want me, yeah
That you don't need nobody else
Say you don't
Say you don't

[Verse 1: Brian Fresco]
Say you don't need no nobody else
In the back of the club with a sack rolled up
We don't need nobody help
Cashmere sweater got my typing on her leather
Like "Shawty come take this sip"
I done watch you powder your nose
See the waves from the song gon' make you dip
I've been drinking all night
I've been watching all night
You've been moving it right and that dress is so tight
Mr. DJ keep playing, my itching, I'm hyped
Baby, tell me we gon' make love song tonight
Yeah that was bold of me, liquor be right
Just promise that you'll take me higher alright
Do me like it's just the last time I write
Keep taking me hashie the drug is my vice

[Hook: Raphaelle Standell-Preston]
Will you come, will you come, will you come take me higher
Will you come, will you come, will you come take me higher

[Bridge: Raphaelle Standell-Preston]
Say you want me, yeah
That you don't need nobody else
Say you want me, yeah
That you don't need nobody else

[Verse 2: Brian Fresco]
And I don't need nobody else
Got my hand on her butt like "baby what's up"
Trying woo a young boy in the crib
Dutty wine in the club
Red bottom, heels scuffed
Don't care cause we both so lit
We done danced around ninety two songs
Know them Slow Jamz on, baby girl let's dip, ay
I roll up in foreignâ€‹ car out the cut
Let the plus keep us up
She keep calling me nuts
She keep claiming she drunk, baby blame it on us
Alcohol just a plus, got me feeling like love
And the circle of lust, girl tonight you're the one
Every girl in this club, I'm like shawty the one
Telling my homies like shawty what's up
She's telling her friends like I tell them what's up

[Bridge: Raphaelle Standell-Preston]
Say you want me, yeah
That you don't need nobody else
Say you want me, yeah
Now you don't need nobody else

[Hook: Raphaelle Standell-Preston]
Will you come, will you come, will you come take me higher
Will you come, will you come, will you come take me higher

[Refrain: Raphaelle Standell-Preston]
Say you don't need nobody else
Say you don't need nobody else

[Verse 3: Chance The Rapper]
I want the bad one
I want the, I want the one with the sew in
I want the mad one
The one with the attitude
She from the low end
She wanna argue
She want to turn up, she want to go there
She gettin' flow now
Get her a chauffer, get her from O'Hare
Look at her face, she's so over it
Baby I'll pay all the overages
Bring you to your door like Oberweis
You can feel it in your ovaries
Skin, I keep the eggs over-easy
Keep the stones way, way over me
I keep her legs wet like overseas
I keep the flame on the potpourri
Yah, yah, yah, yah
Tell the waitress couple cases
When you smoking dope with me
You can smoke in public places
You can skip a couple steps
You could steal a couple bases
Couple friends, a couple chasers
You don't need nobody, baby

[Bridge: Raphaelle Standell-Preston]
Say you want me, yeah
That you don't need nobody else
Say you want me, yeah
Now you don't need nobody else
Say you want me, yeah
That you don't need nobody else
Say you want me, yeah
Now you don't need nobody else
