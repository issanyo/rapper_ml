Glory be to God. I claim this victory in the name of the Lord. I want to thank God for my mother and my father who've supported me since I was young. For Kiersten, for Kinsley, for all of Chicago. And I wanna thank God for putting amazing people in my life like Pete and Pat who have carried me since 2012. I know a lot of times I talk about my independence and people think it had something to do with... oh I'ma talk, y'all can play the music if you want. I wanna thank God for my team. I know people think that independence means you do it by yourself, but independence means freedom. I do it with these folks right here.  Glory be to God, I claim the victory in the name of the Lord, let's go!
