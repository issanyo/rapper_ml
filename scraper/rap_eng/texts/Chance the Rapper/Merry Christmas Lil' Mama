[Verse 1: Jeremih]
Merry Christmas, lil' mama
Know you got it from your mama
Know you got it
Every day feel like Christmas, you gifted, on my mama
My Christmas song make her scream
She like the way that I sang
She don't tell me what she want
But I know just what she want, Christmas
Mistletoe with your misses
I'm all that she missin'
I'm with my fam, with my blood
I swear this Bhristmas
Mama house not a soul missin'
Eatin' good got big dishes
Get along even long distance
She textin' me with the Santa pictures, I say
