[Gaines]
Daewalker on the beat

[Hook]
We are the people that rule the world
A force running in every boy and girl
All rejoicing in the world
Take me now - We can try

[Verse 1: Gaines]

Okay they call me Gaines Mr. Down to earth and still out of this world
On this freaking grizzy bizzy B and bizzy catch you so
Well I’m out to matrix they declaring I’m the one
So much fire in my eyes it’s like I’m staring at the sun
You running here I come I’m grinding getting funds
I’m trying to be the best person I can become
They lie ‘bout what it was
What a nigga like me can’t think don’t smoke don’t drink
At least I try no lie real niggas say what round so OG
I done made some fucked up decisions but I’m a different man
Future is connected to present and I ain't looking back
Disrespect and I’ll introduce you to Edward Pimping Hand
You ho sipping ass no money getting ass sniffing grass
This shits advanced you get one shot don’t miss your chance
My mind is free no mind control could ever silence me
Honestly I’ll never stunt you chicks you ain’t as fine as me
I’m trying to see a dynasty so deuces cinco minus three
I don’t need favors, ain’t waiting on no savior
Y'all talking big but y’all little niggas like J.J. Barea
Whoa the kid got official flow and I swear these niggas just don’t know
And the world’s so cold even if it don’t snow
Mother fuckers better get yo’ coat before it get yo’ soul
If I’m anything ho- ho- homey I’m a king
Rock whatever the fuck I want and you girls still on my team
My dreams I’m so inpatient, no stopping my dedication
Yawl reach for riches and bitches
I’m out here reaching for greatness cause

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Chance The Rapper]
Chance? The Rapper?
My name is Chance
No thing I got them hands
That Xanax be my dance
On 7-9 my land, on chief
Lost my train of thought but I hop on tracks and its shot down
There’s a whole lotta niggas getting shot down
Down in Chi-town
My teacher asked me, “You ever died? You ever died?
Don’t move away from here, ‘cause if you do you never might,
It’s utopic and you hope it’s not a hoax or fucking lie
Or a bogus fucking joke or hocus pocus of the eye”
Say a prayer for all my siblings out there jamming on them pavements
Yawl out there jamming on the road
They out blam-blaming on the weekend
I ain’t scared none of you nigga
They sneaking and they scheming
I was tweaking now I’m decent
That god damn it adol-ee-cense
Anna-Lisa keep ‘em safe, I know it’s getting hard
Right when your son’s coming up is when it get to getting dark
And we might not get no older; they just get us from the start
Better hold us while you can, while we are still where we are (ok)

[Hook]
