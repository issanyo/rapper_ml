[Verse 3 (Freestyle)]
Vodka in my Redbull can, very formal
Shot a porno on a red bull can
Don't be jealous that's the shit that got the devil Dan
Yeah, you got one bigger nigga I got cero hairs
Cheers and dash and dash and Detroit at your rescue, man
But you love the way I treat you extra, and
Got me fillin' up her [?]
And I ate Cheerios for dinner
I broke like 40 balls I'm a cereal bowl killa
Manilla
Fear in an animal
They like "Channo, you're an animal!"
Here's a bunch mushrooms run in the woods and go find ya spirit animal
Um
Hard to devour
Our hearts turnin' sour
I wanna put my twins in a tower so I can hoop my basement and swim in my shower
Choke hold in my wine glass
Propose a toast to the noggin'
I got holes in my socks and coal in my stockin'
Channo was on dirt with all the [?] kids that shot him
So I rode to the North Pole with a poll and I shot him
Batman, Gotham, Autumn
I oughta start selling em'
But I didn't earn that

[Outro]
