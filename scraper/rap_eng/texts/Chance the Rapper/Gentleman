[Intro]
It's Just A Band
Alongside Bajah
Gentleman
With African's originals, ya'know

[Verse 1: Just A Band]
[?]
With the [?] from your eyes is something that would merit
The [?] of kingship is something with [?]
We know we [?], we want infinite credit
Straight up Africans, makin' music is the jungle
[?]
[?], and Mandela
That fought so hard, no retreat, no surrender
To save the only righteous land of Africa
The land of our badge, we are evident [?]
A nation so colorful, beautiful people
Trust in the most high, the Quran and the Bible
This is what we use to destroy the devil
Is there a gentleman, please call [?]

[Hook: Bajah]
I be Africa man original
I be Africa man original
They call you, make it come chop
You chop small, you say your belly full
You say you be gentleman
You go hungry, you go so far, you go quench
Me a lovely gentleman like that
I be Africa man original

[Bridge]
I won't be gentleman at all [x6]
I be Africa man original [x2]
I won't be gentleman at all [x6]
I be Africa man original [x2]

[Verse 2: Chance The Rapper]
Aaaaaaaaaaaah
As seen spit from the mouth of a young Krishna
I'm the spitting image of the sun god
Me the man but me far from just a man
Me be the African man on God
Swing me blade like Blade, swing me chain like Django
Bang bang, slang so Kool-Aid stain my lingo
They buy things like blade, they might change my name
They try sprayin' my marches and tried to take my April
I still walk with a limp, I still bark with a whimper
I build your house in cement, you kicked me out in the winter
You tried to kill me, you hate me
You hate me just cause I'm livin'
You're livin' just cause I saved you
I gave you life that you given
As seen spit from the mouth of a young Krishna
I'm the spitting image of the sun god
Me the man but me far from just a man
Me be the African man on God

[Outro: Bajah]
African man
Africa man, original [x5]
