[Egoraptor] This week on the Atari Mystery Hour, the Pong Paddle Puzzle!
[Danny Sexbang] Chief! Looks like we've got a murder on our hands! One of the Pong paddles is dead, and the ball is missing
[Egoraptor] Alright then Johnson, round up the usual suspect
One hour later...
I know it was you left paddle. What do you have to say for yourself?
*Pong noise*
