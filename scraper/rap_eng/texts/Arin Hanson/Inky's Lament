[Intro: Egoraptor, Danny Sexbang]
Once upon a time in 1982
There were four young ghosts who lived under the iron fist of Pac-Man
He just ate a power pellet! Run!
Oh no! He's coming!
No! Not today, my friends
Inky?! But what are you doing?!
I'm finally taking my stand, Blinky
Hear my words:

[Verse 1: Danny Sexbang]
I want to be free
Free from this maze
I am a ghost, why can't I just fly away?
The cruel yellow monster is not what he seems
These people pay a quarter but it costs us our dreams!
Oh, God!

[Chorus: Danny Sexbang]
Gonna waka-waka walk away
From Pacman's tyranny
I say!
I shall taste freedom tonight!

[Verse 2: Danny Sexbang]
We ride off of the side of the screen
Okay, it looks like we're back at the first side of the screen
That's fine!
At least there are delicious cherries to eat
They're my favorite food
And are you gonna eat those too, Pac-Man?
No that's fucking great

[Chorus: Danny Sexbang]
Gonna waka-waka walk away
From these chains holding me
Hooray!
My moment of triumph comes today

[Outro: Egoraptor, Danny Sexbang]
Oh my God, Inky watch out Pacman's right behind you!
Death has come for us all!
Shit!
Ooh-woop!
