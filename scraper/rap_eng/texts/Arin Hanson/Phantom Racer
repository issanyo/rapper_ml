[Skit 1: Arin Hanson]
It’s a beautiful evening here as we get ready to start the race. The drivers are at the line and it looks like we’re almost set. Racers, start your engines. Go!

...What’s this? A mystery car has just entered the race and he’s coming from behind, like a bullet!

[Verse 1: Raul Panther III & Doctor Sung (Arin Hanson)]
Can't slow down this time
I gotta rev it up and go
I gotta keep it in the lines
Tonight there's blood on the road
I keep the pedal down
They’re gonna know how this felt
No one gets into heaven
Without racing through hell
Eye for eye, lap for lap
There's no turning back
(And he’s caught them! That’s one hell of a driver!)
You’ve got to slow down
Feels like my blood is runnin' hot
The needle’s in the red
Give me everything you've got
I can't escape the blood and steel
The death behind the wheel!

[Skit 2: Arin Hanson]
I can’t believe what I’m seeing! In a shocking turn of events, the mystery car seems to be picking off each racer one by one. I wouldn’t want to be out on that track tonight. This driver is out for blood!

[Verse 2: Raul Panther III]
I’m burnin’ up the road
I got ‘em dead in my sight
And when the rubber meets the bone
There’ll be vengeance tonight
Hear the crowd roar
Callin' for blood
Beggin' for more

[Chorus]
(Faster)
I can hear my heart beatin'
(Faster)
Like a piston in my chest
(Faster)
I’m a phantom racer, justice in a steel machine of death
(Faster)
I’ll be right behind you
(Faster)
Over and over again
(Faster)
I was born to race
(Faster)
I would die to win

[Skit 3: Arin Hanson]
We’re down to just two cars now! Like a man possessed, he’s murdered every other racer and seems to be zeroing in on first place! The remaining car is speeding down this straight away like he’s being chased by the devil himself. In an incredible burst of speed, the mystery driver has rammed the first place car from behind and seems to be pushing him forward! The lead racer is clearly slamming on the brakes, but the two of them show no signs of slowing down at all! There’s no way they can make this next turn at that speed! I can’t bear to watch!

Out of the flames comes the mystery driver. I don’t know how he survived that horrible crash, or where he’s going to next, but I can’t help thinking there’s something strangely familiar about that car…

[Outro: Raul Panther III, Doctor Sung]
(Faster)
I can hear my heart beatin’
(Faster)
Like a piston in my chest
(Faster)
I’m a phantom racer, justice in a steel machine of death
(Faster)
I’ll be right behind you
(Faster)
Over and over again
(Faster)
'Cause I was born to race
I would die to win
(Faster)
'Cause I’m a phantom racer
(Faster)
Inside my steel machine of death
(Faster, born to race)
Phantom, baby
And I would die to win
(Faster)
'Cause I’m a phantom racer
(Faster)
(Faster)
I can feel my heart beatin'
Phantom, baby
Faster and faster and
(Faster)
