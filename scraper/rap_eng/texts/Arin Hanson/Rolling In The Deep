[Intro]
Arin: That song's called 'Rolling In The Deep'
Dan: It is
Arin: Like what does that mean?
Dan: I don’t know
Arin: Like you're really deep underwater and you're just kinda rolling around. That’s what the whole song's about
Dan: Not, I'm pretty sure its not
Arin: Really emotional song and she's just like...

[Verse 1]
Down there with the fish
I'm rolling all around
Hanging out with all the fish
More fish come around
Lot's of fish
More fishy fish
Hey what's up new fish
God there are a lot of fish
In this ocean full of fish

[Pre-Chorus]
Uh..
Uh..
Uh..
Uh..
Uh..
Uh..

[Chorus]
Arin Hanson is the funniest man alive
And now I'm gonna roll
Roll with all the fish
It sure is fucking deep
Where the fish are
They touch my feet (ew)

[Verse 2]
You are Mario
Gonna play my level now
Watch out for those fireballs
They'll send you right to hell
(Yeah there you go)
Boy fish sure are gross
When you touch them with your feet
Yucky toes, got yucky toes
Makes me... unhappy (Fuck)

[Pre-Chorus]
Uh..
Uh..
Uh..
Uh..
Uh..
Uh..

[Chorus]
Arin Hanson is the funniest man alive
And now I'm gonna roll
Roll with all the fish
It sure is fucking deep
Where the fish are
They touch my feet
Now I'm gonna roll
Roll with all the fish
It sure is fucking deep
Where the fish are
They touch my feet

[Bridge]
Arin: Did she do any other songs? Is that her EP, just two songs?
Dan: No she's had a bunch of hits
Arin: Really?
Dan: Yeah, she's very talented
Arin: Man, she must be a boxer then, haha. She had a lot of hits
Dude, just pity laugh at least

[Interlude]
Arin: If we were on stage and I made a joke like that people would just look at you like, 'Is it- is it ok to laugh, is he going to laugh?' and you didn’t so people would think I was a freak. People would think I was a fucking- people would think I was a big fat phony

[Chorus]
People think you're fat
A fat fucking phony
It sure is fucking deep
Where the fish are
They touch my feet
Now I'm gonna roll
Roll with all the fish
It sure is fucking deep
Where the fish are
The fish are
The fish are
The fish
They touch my feet

[Outro]
Dan: Just pity laugh please
[laughter]
