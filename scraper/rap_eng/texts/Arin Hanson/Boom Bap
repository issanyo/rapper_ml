[Intro: Dan Avidan & Arin Hanson]
Um, this, uh, he, uh
Heheheee-heehhhh
Is that, is that
Em-One
Yeah! Now we're groovin'
Uh, these are my jams, by the way
Whoa, wait
You want some mad tunes?
Yeah, please
I can give you some tunes, if you want
This could be for all the beans
Yeah, it's gonna come right down to it
This is for all the beans in the can, dude!
Both: Gaaaaaame Grumps!

[Verse 1: Dan Avidan & Arin Hanson]
I'll just wait five minutes, probably, or something
Adrift at sea, gotta go pee
Extremely confused, floating on the river now
Don't know when the episode ends anymore
Yo, I came in here for an upgrade, not to advance
I wanna do my dance
Better lose those pants
Oopsie daisy, I have made a mistake
The timer's wrong, forgot to press pause
Daaaamn, I was mistaken
Boom
Bam
I apologize
Yo, I didn't mean to
Yo, cause that's not what does it
That's not what fucking does it, yo
Yo, I can't do that shit

[Chorus: Dan Avidan & Arin Hanson]
Both: Boom bap with the bizzity bap
Snip snap with the grizzity grap
I fucked up, yo, straight up fucked
We don't know where we're going anymore
Both: Boom bap with the bizzity bap
Snip snap with the grizzity grap
I fucked up, yo, straight up fucked
Boom bap t'p' bringing it back

[Verse 2: Dan Avidan & Arin Hanson]
This is a pretty good display
Of just how good I am
I hope you girls at home
Brought a change of underwear
Because this shit is hot
Oh, sploosh
Am I right, ladies?
Where are you going?
Okay
I understand your puns and all
But I don't appreciate them
So dial it back, and maybe get a little respect
I can't get back up
Yeah!
Super missile time
Can I grab on with my fucking blaster and shit?
Oh, I found out where I need to go, yo
Where is it?
Yo, not here

[Chorus: Dan Avidan & Arin Hanson]
Both: Boom bap with the bizzity bap
Snip snap with the grizzity grap
I fucked up, yo, straight up fucked
We don't know where we're going anymore
Both: Boom bap with the bizzity bap
Snip snap with the grizzity grap
I fucked up, yo, straight up fucked
Boom bap t'p' bringing it back

Both beatboxing

[Bridge: Dan Avidan]
Hey!
Do it even more, do it even more
Do it even more, do it even more
Do it even more, do it even more
Cash money, millionaire, bitch!

[Chorus: Dan Avidan & Arin Hanson]
Both: Boom bap with the bizzity bap
Snip snap with the grizzity grap
I fucked up, yo, straight up fucked
We don't know where we're going anymore
Both: Boom bap with the bizzity bap
Snip snap with the grizzity grap
I fucked up, yo, straight up fucked
Boom bap t'p' bringing it back
