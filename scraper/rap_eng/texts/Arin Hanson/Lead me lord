VERSE 1:
Lead me Lord, lead me by the hand
And help me face the rising sun
Comfort me through all the pain
That life may bring
There's no other hope
That I can lean upon

VERSE 2:
Lead me Lord
Lead me all my life
Walk by me, walk by me across
The lonely road that I may face
Take my arms and let your hand
Show me the way
Show the way to live inside your heart
All my days, all my life

CHORUS:
You are my light
You're the lamp upon my feet
All the time my Lord
I need You there
You are my life
I cannot live alone
Let me stay
By Your guiding love
All through my life
Lead me Lord

VERSE 3:
Lead me Lord
Even though at times
I'd rather go alone my way
Help me take the right direction
Take Your road
Lead me Lord
And never leave my side
All my days
All my life

You are my light
You're the lamp upon my feet
All the time my Lord
I need You there
You are my life
I cannot live alone
Let me stay
By Your guiding love
All through my life

You are my light
You're the lamp upon my feet
All the time my Lord
I need You there
You are my life
I just cannot live alone
Let me stay
By Your guiding love
All through my life
All through my days
Oh lead me, Oh Lord
Lead me Lord
