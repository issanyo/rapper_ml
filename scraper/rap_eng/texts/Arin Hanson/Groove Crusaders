[Verse 1: Doctor Sung]
We are groove crusaders
Makin' lovers out of haters
We are groove crusaders
Front line of the disco war
We are groove crusaders
And we're gonna even up the score

[Pre-Chorus: Doctor Sung]
The time has come
The time is now
It is now time for the
Groove crusaders

[Chorus: Doctor Sung]
We rule in the name of fun
We will groove as one
Against boredom
Won't stop 'til we are done
Watch out, 'cause here we come
We will groove as one
Against boredom
Won't stop 'til we are done

[Verse 2: Doctor Sung]
We are groove crusaders
Makin' lovers out of haters
Groove with me
Baby, I'll be your hero
Your body is a sex bomb
And my body is ground zero

[Chorus: Doctor Sung]
We rule in the name of fun
We will groove as one
Against boredom
Won't stop 'til we are done
Watch out, 'cause here we come
We will groove as one
Against boredom
Won't stop 'til we are done

[Spoken Bridge: Arin Hanson]
Next time on Groove Crusaders...
Four legendary warriors from distant worlds come together to combat the forces of evil personified by the dastardly haters
Sworn enemies of the fun who are bent on hatering them and ungroovifying the world at large
Can our heroes conquer these uncool foes?
Or will boredom and general badness overtake the inner groove of these four funky fighters?
Find out next time on Groove Crusaders!

[Chorus: Doctor Sung]
We rule in the name of fun
We will groove as one
Against boredom
Won't stop 'til we are done
Watch out, 'cause here we come
We will groove as one
Against boredom
We will groove as one

[Outro: Doctor Sung]
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, yeah
