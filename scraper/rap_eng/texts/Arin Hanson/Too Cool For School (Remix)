[Verse 1]
When I was just a kid you know I hated goin' to school
Cause every time I’d freakin' show up they just tell me "you ain't cool"
I saw the strangest shit everyday bro
People lost their fuckin’ minds
Even though I had hurricane within me raging deep inside
I put them so far up above me
I just wanted validation
I just wanted to my rep colors in a whole new foreign nation
I was the new kid
On the motherfuckin' block
And every single motherfucker would just always point and mock
It was a race against the clock
Cause one of them, they would get socked
If I had anything to do with it, you know I'd clean their clock
But all that stuff, yo it took guts
It took a fuckin' lot to muster up the courage
Load the turret with my urine and a whole lotta new wordage
It's a pissin' contest, you know I won that shit
Cause I don't let it go, I just stand up and I get pissed
And then day it finally stopped was when I made a fuckin' fist
I put my foot down on the ground, they knew they’d never ever make me sit

[Chorus 1]
All the little things
All the small things
Inside my head
Take a look
Come with me
This is where the party’s at
Don't waste your time on the small things
Don’t sweat the small stuff

All the little things
All the small things
Inside my head
Take a look
Come with me
This is where the party's at
Come with me
And it's all small stuff

[Verse 2]
Don't get me started on exams, you know they tried to test my temper
Cause these fuckers look at zeroes, like they’re some sort of computer
Useless bullshit, fuckin' students, and some equally stupid teachers
And this is comin' from a guy who taught kids that they could do it
I used to teach an art class, and you know I loved it every second
The way they'd grab a brush, and they'd check in to the lesson
Fuck a flash card, pull a trump card, you go hard dog, like the nard dog
Paint a picture, fuck a stricture, fuckin' shake shit, make the Richter

[Chorus 2]
All the little things
All the small things
Inside my head
Take a look
Come with me
This is where the party's at
Don't waste your time on the small things
Don't sweat the small stuff

[Outro]
All the little things
All the small things
Inside my head
Take a look
Come with me
This is where the party's at
Don't waste your time on the small things
(Come with me...)
(And it's all small stuff)
Don't sweat the small stuff

All the little things (and it's all small stuff)
All the small things (and it's all small stuff)
Inside my head (and it's all small stuff)
Take a look (and it's all small stuff)
Come with me (and it's all small stuff)
This is where the party's at (and it's all small stuff)
Come with me (and it's all small stuff)
And it's all small stuff
