[Intro: Arin Hanson]
Ancient wisdom, arcane art
Martial prowess that will stop your heart
Epic power, discipline
Nuclear moves that always win!

[Chorus: Doctor Sung]
I split the atom with my high kick, baby
I am a master 'cause I practice daily in atomic karate

[Bridge: Doctor Sung]
The color of my belt is blacker than night
The enemies see me and run in fright
I will not hesitate to use it, too
On anyone who stands between me and you

[Verse 1: Doctor Sung]
There's only one thing hotter than my karate
It's when you dance and shake and rock that body (yeah!)
I see you movin' how you flow like a river
You do it so good, girl, that you make me shiver

[Chorus: Doctor Sung]
I split the atom with my high kick, baby
I am a master 'cause I practice daily in atomic karate

[Synth Solo: Brian Wecht]

[Verse 2: Doctor Sung]
All I have to do is show up to the fight
I make their heads explode when I come into sight
I spin my nunchucks and release a trillion newton
Forces of evil, I will always leave in ruin

[Chorus: Doctor Sung]
I split the atom with my high kick, baby
I am a master 'cause I practice daily in atomic karate

[Post-Chorus: Doctor Sung]
System overload

[Bridge: Arin Hanson]
心に聖なる戦時の血へ
新兵の技そして行かんが戦い
その壮大な力と丹念が
覚悟戦うの勝利を導く

[Verse 3: Doctor Sung]
If we join forces we would set the world right
Imagine you and me girl, wouldn't it be tight?
I could be your love sensei
If you'd be my atomic karate lady

[Chorus: Doctor Sung]
I split the atom with my high kick, baby
I am a master 'cause I practice daily in atomic karate
