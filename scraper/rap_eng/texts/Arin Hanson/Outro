[Egoraptor] 1, 2, 3, I gotta go pee--
[Danny Sexbang] Woah, woah. Sorry to interrupt this amazing rap, Egoraptor, but we're out of time for this album.
[Egoraptor] What? Really?
[Danny] Yeah. We're gonna have to save all our raps for the next Starbomb album.
[Egoraptor] Oh my god! Another album!
[Danny] You'd better believe it! It's totally a thing that's happening.
[Egoraptor] Dude, it's gonna be amazing!
[Danny] It'a gonna be so crazy. Hey Producer Dave, can you stop the music for a second?
[Egoraptor] Hey, Dan. You wanna see how close I can get to the mic?
[Danny] I bet I can get closer.
[Egoraptor] No, I bet I can get closer.
[Danny] And then I can get closer.
[Egoraptor] *slurring and choking*
[Danny] See you next album!
*both laugh*
