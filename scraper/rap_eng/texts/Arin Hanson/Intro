Hello everyone, I am Egoraptor
From the show Game Grumps and also from the video game music comedy band Starbomb

Welcome to the first album by Big Bad Bosses or B3, a turn of the millennium style hip hop boy band featuring parody and fair use of some of the most evil video game villains ever assembled

Like that big spikey turtle, the dark wizard of the-the desert, that animal-obsessed super scientist or whatever, and one winged pretty boy

I'm just reading this from a script, but before we give you a chance to listen to any of the ten songs on this album, I just wanted to warn you, actually you know what

(Gunshot)

I'm gonna put this script away
Originally Jirard wanted me to say that this album is horrible, and its terrible, blah blah blah its kind of a joke, but I've heard it and I think its actually really really good

Uhh, so I hope you enjoy B3 with their debut
LETS ROCK!
