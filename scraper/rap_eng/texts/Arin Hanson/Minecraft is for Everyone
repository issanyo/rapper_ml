[Verse 1: Egoraptor]
Strolling down the street, the square street
A fair sheet, of square sleet below my feet
Creeper's what they call me
But even I see, that all of this beauty
Can fill me with such glee
Look at this tall tree
It's nature's majesty
Would it be so bad if someone
BLEW THE F**K OUT OF IT?!
This sweet pig here, alone walking around
He has the perfect face for
GETTING RIPPED FROM THE INSIDE F**KING OUT!

[Pre-Chorus: Danny Sexbang, Egoraptor]
Hey Mr. Creeper
WHAT?!
There's no need for that kind of language
F**K YOU!
The only F-word is fun
Life's even sweeter
Without explosions
Minecraft is for everyone!

[Chorus: Danny Sexbang & Egoraptor]
Hurray!
Let's all be nice today
Everyone is at play
And there's no need to blow them away
Oh, hi!
Let's go help those two guys
Build a house that--
*BOOM*
No, no, see, this is exactly what I'm talking about
If you've gotta curse, just say the word fudge, that way no one will judge--
*BOOM*
Stop!
No more exploding or cursing, no one else has to die! Okay?
F**k it, I'll try
Okay, we're off to a bad start, but that's fine

[Verse 2: Egoraptor]
I'm on a nice kick
I'll make some friends quick
I don't have many, because everyone's a huge di-augh...
I have to ad-mit
I just might lose it
Having to give up my favorite things is FUNKY BULLSHRIMP!
Man, it's hard not to be mean

[Bridge: Notch, Egoraptor]
Hey guys, do you need help writing lyrics?
No, you don't even know Minecraft music
But... but I'm Notch
More like NOTCH-yo song!
Oh, sugar-snap peas I went there!

[Chorus: Danny Sexbang, Egoraptorr]
Tee-hee!
We're so happy and free
Let's clear away the debris
From all the ruined lives of your killing spree
It's fun!
To be nice to someone
They'll really love you a ton
You know what?
Why don't you kneel down and kiss my creepy-- buns!
You'll feel so much love and magic in rapture
Hearts will be captured
You monkey-fighting GLASSBALL MOTHER SCRATCHER!
We just learned a lesson
Creepers can make amends
Guess what? You're my new frie--
*BOOM*
