[Verse 1: Egoraptor, Danny Sexbang]
Woah
Rollin' out motherfuckers, it's the robots in disguise
Led by Optimus Prime, a bot whose power never dies
Cars and vans and planes, fucking construction trucks
They're goin' undercover 'cause Decepticons don't give a fuck
Autobots, it's time. We're rolling out
Right!
Oh my God, that truck is Optimus, without a doubt!
Uhhh, no I'm not
Yes you are, my dearest robot bro
You guys been on my lunchbox since the 19-fuckin-80s yo!
Oh balls. Autobots! Listen here
I think it's time to try to find another way to disappear!
New disguises that our enemies could never recognize
Bumblebee become a burger; Prowl, you are the side of fries!
Huh?
Do it!
Don't you wanna light our darkest hour?
Jazz, you're now a birthday cake
You've got the touch
I've got the flour!

[Chorus: Danny Sexbang]
Oh!
Autobots, roll out
Oh!
Let's show 'em what we're all about
We'll catch 'em by surprise when we're in disguise
As a trunk full of sprouts and a tiny Asian girl scout
Oh!
Now the time has come
Oh!
To rock the Decepti-scum
They better be alert cause we can now convert
To a skirt, polo shirt, and a little mound of wet dirt
Oh!
Megatron will pay
As soon as I take on the form of this delightful soufflee
Okay!

[Verse 2: Egoraptor, Danny Sexbang]
Woah
After hours and hours of transforming into stuff
The Autobots decided on a plan that's super-duper tough
Those Decepti-dicks won't see us coming at all
When we roll up together as random kiosks at the local mall
Yeah!
Who'd even think to guess
That Bumblebee is selling cell phone chargers
For three dollars less a cent?
Yeah!
They'll never know we're here
While we're hocking beauty products
Making teenage acne disappear
As if!
They could stop Ratchet before, bitch!
He's combined with Ironhide to form a turkey sandwich
And I haven't even mentioned
The ace that's up my sleeve
He rocks a jet engine that'll make your ears bleed
He'll betray Megatron, plus he's boisterous and loud
This is your moment
C'mon Starscream, now break it down!

[Bridge: Danny Sexbang, Egoraptor]
Hey. This... I'm Starscream
What?
I just, I just wanted to say that, Megatron
Speak up, man!
Megatron, you're going down, I'm gonna--
Speak
*snot noises* I'm gonna win, I'm Starscream
Ugh, come on
*coughing, gagging, snot noises*
Alright, you know what? Forget it

[Chorus: Danny Sexbang]
Oh!
Autobots, let's fight
Oh!
These enemies with all our might!
Time to do what's right and transform tonight
To five kites, egg whites, and a family of field mice
Oh!
The Decepticons
Oh!
Are now ten tanks and a giant gun
While Grimlock's a rake and I'm a warm milkshake
There's a small chance we made a very tiny mistake
Oh!
Well it's too late now
We're the good guys and I'm sure that everything will work out

[Outro: Egoraptor, Danny Sexbang]
Megatron! You're going d-- AAAAAAAAH
(woah)
Optimus, I had really-- I had a lot o--
Starscream, shut up!
Uh, 'mkay
