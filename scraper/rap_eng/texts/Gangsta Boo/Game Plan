(Laughter)

[Verse 1: Gangsta Boo]
Ey, the game is like this, bitch why you gon' fuck that nigga?
He ain't gon' give you shit but bubble gum and dick up in ya
You gotta make 'em chase, replace his ass wit a bottle of vodka
Then hit the club and get real crunk and dance to that Waka Flocka
"Oh Lets Do It!" make dat, make dat gun sound (Boom)
And you can't get up on my team if you be groupie bound
We do not play like that even tho the game is serious ladies
We gotta keep in mind, first we beat some ladies baby
You say you want the diamonds, why you over there selling for gold?
That dick ain't golden, that dick can get the fuck up out my door
I want the wifey status, nothing against you baby mommies
If it ain't beneficial it ain't necessary mommy
I'mma put it like this: you wanna give your pussy up like that?
You gon' just be another bitch who he put on her back

[Hook: Gangsta Boo]
I called a time out, bring that ass to the bench
Circle up around me, I'm your new coach bitch
Now this da Game Plan

I called for time out, bring that ass to the bench
Circle up around me, I'm your new coach bitch

[Verse 2: T-Rock]
Bring that ass back to the bench and sit since you need a coach
I'm a major factor in this bizness, ain't no need to boast
The sky is what I'm reachin' fo', I feel I'm there when chiefin' dro
This is double homicide cause didn't I murk this beat before?
So fuck the fake looks on Facebook, we straight crooks
We got the opposition sank and rearranged in playbooks
I'm a conquerer, burnin' up your thermometer
You see this shit we drop is hotter than candles at Hanukkah Nigga

[Verse 3: II Tone]
Hoe you wanna be a star? Go and post up on Lamar
I done been to jail, done seen the light
Now my game be supertight
I don't love a bitch, I don't trust a hoe
Money ain't right, better got get a hoe
Never affected, put a bitch in her place
Shawty get wrong, I'mma catch another case
I'm sick of you bitches that digging for riches
You fuckin' with pimpin' you end up with stitchin'
Never no love for no stuck up ass bitches
I fuck wit hoes that do hair in the kitchen
I pray for patience all the time for a funky slut
I like to paper chase a hoe that'll lick my nuts

[Verse 4: Lord Infamous]
BLAY!
Infamous holdin' hostility, I'm vanquishing all of my enemies
I will concentrate all of my energy, eliminatin' you niggas that hinder me
Give 'em the guillotine, I am a epitome, pick your poison, misery killin' me
So I have no problems with yo mammy in the black dress when the preacher and choir sing
Scarecrow, I have no love for human beings when I conquer the conquerer and (?) King
Massacre every MC on the scene then I come to the the morgue and I get a front seat
Mossberg will knock your damn shoes off your feet, he layin' there but his damn head not complete
Fire sl-izz-ugs till he look like ground meat, on the menu it's murder and no sympathy
Mockeries obsolete, the possibility is defeat
Get the pliers, pull out yo teeth, you wanna face this fuckin' beef
I will not cease until you are deceased
Forever war, there is no peace
If I get some time for my war crimes I'd never be released
Time is of the essence so evacuate your presence
Learn from others lessons or you'll taste the Smith & Wesson
The smell of burning flesh, yeah you can taste it on your tongue
I put a bullet in your head the size of a damn thumb

[Hook: Gangsta Boo]
I called a time out, bring that ass to the bench
Circle up around me, I'm your new coach bitch
Now this da Game Plan
