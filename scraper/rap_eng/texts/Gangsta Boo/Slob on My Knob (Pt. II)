[Intro: Gangsta Boo]
Slob on my cat
Cause you know it's fat
Check in with me
And do that

[Verse 1: Juicy J]
Wait a second freak
I know you from the streets
My nigga Hurry T
Has said you chew his meat
They call you little red
The one who slobs on head
And drinks a niggas nut
Until you well and fed
To see what she's about
I creeped to her house
To catch her in her blouse
And see how big her mouth
She pulled me to her room
To get the fuckin soon
I didn't have a rubber
I fucked with two balloons
Lay on the bed
That's all she said
Her pussy has one problem
Twisted tight in streads
The fucken sounds were tunes
I fucked her with a broom
She rode it like a horse
The blood came rushing soon
When I seen that
I didn't want the cat
So I found out
And never came back

[Chorus]
Sucks on dick
Does it real good
Sucks sucks on dick
Does it real good
Sucks on dick
Does it real good
Sucks sucks on dick
Does it real good

[Verse 2: Juicy J]
My nigga D Magic
Had said he finally got it
The chewin' balls blow
He said he had to have it
Know a little freak
In big ham
Licks up nuts
Like lickin stamps
She'll grant your wishes
Blow you freaky kisses
House full of G's
Freak horse bitches
Had the little freak
In my niggas jeep
Try to spit some game
To get her suck some meat
Lay on the cover
My natural hair she loved it
Stop bitch stop bitch
Please don't touch it
Took her through some hoods
And let her ho around
7 street 9 street
And street of walks and brown
Now she's in click
A pro on suckin dick
Until the rugged out
The bitch was smokin bricks
Straight trough the blow pipes
That's all she thought
Runnin from the rehab
Never got caught

[Chorus]
Sucks on dick
Does it real good
Sucks sucks on dick
Does it real good
Sucks on dick
Does it real good
Sucks sucks on dick
Does it real good
