Gangsta Boo: I did a remix to a bounce record. It was called "Nasty Bitch", but I remixed it to call it "Nasty Trick". You know, just the bounce sound, Manny Fresh, No Limit, Cash Money, of course. I'm friends with all of them, so it was just a perfect fit. What I wanted to do was something different, like the men doing. You would hear Jay Z, Rick Ross, and Future all on the same track. I was like, wait we need a track with just all females. It hadn't been done before. Most of these bitches jealous of each other. Lemme do something with my friends who just so happen to be legendary artist of the South. The song is just so dope, with Mia X and La Chat And it's honestly dope to me because I am having out of body experiences all the time, and I'm like "Yo, I'm on a song with Mia X and Chat and Paul did the beat and I pulled that off." So it's cool
