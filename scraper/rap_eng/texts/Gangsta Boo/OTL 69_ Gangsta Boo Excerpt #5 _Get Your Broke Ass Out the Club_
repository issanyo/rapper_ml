SameOldShawn: Can you tell us a little about how you wrote that and your relationship to dancers, to sex workers?

Gangsta Boo: Yeah, man I was in Atlanta a lot, and one of my girlfriends named Smokey. She was a stripper at the time, and I asked her, what do y'all say in the strip clubs? What's going on in the strip clubs? I could never forget it. What to y'all say in the strip clubs? And she was like, "We be sayin, 'Get your broke ass out the club if you ain't gonn' tip.'" And I was like, "Really?" And she was like, "Yeah, we just be kicking people out, telling them if they ain't gonna tip they can get the fuck out." And I literally was like, "Ok bye." She was in Atlanta at home at the time and I was in Memphis in Hypnotize Studios, and that's how it came about. Yeah, literally just like that
