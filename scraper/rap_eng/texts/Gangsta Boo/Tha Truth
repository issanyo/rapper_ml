[Verse 1]
Let's Go!
These niggas be talkin all that game
No, I don't really wanna do tha damn thang
Everytime I look around niggas say my name
Boy, what you think on when you gimmie brain
No I ain't gospel cause I changed my name
Niggas lookin sick like they lost six
Opps I meant to say fuck em shh--
No, I meant to say oops and fuck em shh--
Nigga I got my own mafia
UGQ and the street ringers popular
Where the Boo baby I been chillin'
Shawtee gotta keep it in sippin and pimpin
I know yall gonna hate it when I say-
Ride round town hate on me anyway
It really dizz-ont mizz-atter
Because the dizzlady gonna mizzake it
To the next day
I been getting myself together
Dodgin' all the stormy weather
I'm in yo hood lookin good
Ride real good, leather and wood
I got my own label
Kicked niggas out that wasn't loyal
Watch niggas crumble up like foil
Niggas be crowning me cause I'm royal
STOP IT!
