Smoke comin' up out my gun
Smoke comin' up out my mouth
Smoke comin' up out my gun
Smoke comin' up out my mouth
Smoke comin' up out my gun
Smoke comin' up out my mouth
Smoke comin' up out my gun

[Verse 1: Gangsta Boo]
I smoke so much weed that my nickname "Smokey"
Twist it, light it, hit, that's that fire, I ain't jokin'
Molly makin' weed brownies in the kitchen flexin'
Darth Vader set to the chest got me coughin'
Never smoked that regular, that weed is bullshit
Cookie master kushie got me freaky as a bitch
White boys love it when I hit they weed pipe
Cause they know it's goin' down
And I'mma fuck him all night, high

[Bridge: 8ball & MJG sample]

[Hook: DJ Paul & MJG]
I got the smoke comin' up out my mouth
Smoke comin' up out my gun
Smoke comin' up out my mouth
Smoke comin' up out my gun
Smoke comin' up out my mouth
Smoke comin' up out my gun
Smoke comin' up out my mouth
Smoke comin' up out my gun

[Verse 2: MJG]
Let me take a second, I be tryin' to get the greatest
And latest type of smokin' I can get my hands on
Something I'mma prolly spend a couple grand on
Roll up blunts, flavorless
... gotta roll up every fuckin' day I get
Higher than the motherfuckin' day before
You say you wanna smoke one? say no more
Pimp tight M-J ... smoke of the gun
The lean that I prolly miss when I shot
It's yo boy that'll get up and hope you can run
You know that we be talkin' 'bout this shit
Every since way back in the drop top
Next two-seater
You know that I'm a pimp comin' out hard
In the nine millimeter nigga
When it comes to the heater

[Verse 3: 8Ball]
I'm on weed, I'm on drank
Dump 'em down, pour up pints
Roll up pounds, swisher sweets
Got me floatin' up outta my seat
This exclusive just for me
Groupie niggas please leave
This for me, myself and I
Certain bitches smoke for free
Fat boy front row
Extra special, not yo average
That money in my mattress
That's for the re-up, for my package
Big Ball stay throwed
Only pause for the grind
I get stoned like them white boys
Gone out my mind

[Bridge: 8ball & MJG sample]
One to da motherfuckin' two
To da motherfuckin' three
(And Yean High as me)
One to da motherfuckin' two
To da motherfuckin' three
(And Yean High as me)

[Hook: DJ Paul/Beat Change]
I got the smoke comin' up out my mouth
Smoke comin' up out my gun
Smoke comin' up out my mouth
Smoke comin' up out my gun
Smoke comin' up out my mouth
Smoke comin' up out my gun
Smoke comin' up out my mouth
Smoke comin' up out my gun

[Verse 4: Lord Infamous]
Scarecrow is the pharmacy
Pound of kush a quarter key
And when I OD
But the gods they resurrect a G
Poppin', sniffin', smokin'
Overloadin' when I'm noddin'
You bitches on some garbage
Trick I do them real narcotics
Where is the bud, where is the bud?
You scrubs, you don't do drugs
Like I do drugs
Like I told you hoes
Narcotics all up in my DNA
Lord is on the opiates
Blown straight out the Milky Way
BLAY!

[Verse 5: Crunchy Black]
I'm on weed, I'm on drank
I'm on pills, I'm on dank
I'm on bars, I'm on tabs
I'm so high I'm 'bout to faint
Bout to pour up 2 liter
With four fuckin' Oz's
I'mma make it so muddy
That I'm 'bout to lose control
I'm like "Where my cup?"
I'm like blowin' it up
And I love when I'm high
Cause I really don't give a fuck
I like purple stuff
I like smokin' it up
If you got some nigga
Then you might as well puff

[Verse 6: Koopsta Knicca]
(Hiiigh)
Voices in my head
All you got 'em scared
All by myself
Koop shout in my bed
Sell a bitch that swole
We cook this in stoves
Paul pass me a swisher
And blow out a cloud of smoke
Blunts I twist
It's the continued, next
I had a session with some bab
Just like chillum sex
Bush relax me
Bush relax me
Bitch I stay hiii-high
