[Intro: Gangsta Boo]



[Verse 1: BeatKing]
Club Godzilla, ain't no nigga triller
I'm  the only one that rap, all my niggas killers
Still tearing clubs up, bitch I'm never chilling
Still droppin' hits, niggas still stealing
Club God 4, I done pimped on your ho
Told her drop it low, got the pussy in the door
You know it go, 20 deep in the show
Strapped in VIP I aIn't never been a ho
Five years ago I told these hoes I run these clubs
Five years later bitch I still run these clubs
Saw a hating ho from highschool last night
Nutted in her face cause five years ago she wouldn't fuck
H-Town, bitch popping doors crumbs on my shirt
Make that ass twerk, white bitches snorting work
Young CG I show you how to get this paper
Nigga talking down we drop his ass like a tape

[Outro: Gangsta Boo]
