[Intro]
I be mashin’, I be mashin’
I be mashin’ for that paper
I be mashin’, I be mashin’
I be mashin’ for that paper
When ya broke they disgrace you
When you all then they hate ya On my wrist it’s a glacier
Bought that bitch with some paper
I be mashin’, I be mashin’
I be mashin’ for that paper I be mashin’
I be mashin’, I be mashin’ for that paper
When ya broke they disgrace you
When you all then they hate ya
On my wrist it’s a glacier
Bought that bitch with some paper

[Verse 1:Gangsta Boo]
Mashin’ and I’m killin’ these bitches
Hustle gang truly forgiveness
Witness how I be turnin’ these posture bricks
Main solo, I don’t need no pickin’ shit
I’m mashed out in my drop-top
I got my broad-top on and my bank account on me
Most of you hoes be fallin’ really on me in my business
Tryna act like you my homies
Made, I got it made, later threw the shade
I got 100 ways that I can get payed
They already know, if they wanna see the gangsta
They gon’ have to come up with a whole lotta fuckin’ paper
I read it through the dirt, I buy myself
Fuckin’ with the bosses, why ya fuckin’ with the help?
I’m mashed out with the wrist out
Cuz I been gettin’ money where the knowledge is ?

[Hook]
I be mashin’, I be mashin’, I be mashin’ for that paper
I be mashin’, I be mashin’, I be mashin’ for that paper
When ya broke they disgrace you, when you all then they hate ya
On my wrist it’s a glacier, bought that bitch with some paper
I be mashin’, I be mashin’, I be mashin’ for that paper
I be mashin’, I be mashin’, I be mashin’ for that paper
When ya broke they disgrace you, when you all then they hate ya
On my wrist it’s a glacier, bought that bitch with some paper

[Verse 2]
If they broke, they don’t ask for no phone-call
Call me like I neva sold 1 million records, y’all
I’m yo bitch, I’m yo bu, pullin’ up in Beverly Hills
Music loud in the Coupe, valet tellin’ me to chill
I am a gangsta fo’ real, been askin’ you bitches to quit it
Please, you snitch then you go
We all know that you did it cuz you were quittin’
Leave, niggas be still in my flow
Tryna treat me in my flow and it’s all funny
Cuz you bitches secretly hatin’ for bein’ in my shows
Bad trick, I am the shit
Mashin’ and dashin’ for what I’mma get
You play in the lane while I’m makin’ hits
I’m walkin’ on sand; I’m rich as a bitch
When I be broke, they don’t answer the phone
When I’m on tour, I be missin’ my home
Gate is protected and gated by drones
Always on point cuz I stay in my zone

[Hook]
I be mashin’, I be mashin’, I be mashin’ for that paper
I be mashin’, I be mashin’, I be mashin’ for that paper
When ya broke they disgrace you, when you all then they hate ya
On my wrist it’s a glacier, bought that bitch with some paper
I be mashin’, I be mashin’, I be mashin’ for that paper
I be mashin’, I be mashin’, I be mashin’ for that paper
When ya broke they disgrace you, when you all then they hate ya
On my wrist it’s a glacier, bought that bitch with some paper
