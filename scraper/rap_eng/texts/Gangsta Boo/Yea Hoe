[Intro]
Oh, Sinjin Hawke!

I love gangsta niggas, gangsta niggas love me
Me and the gangsta niggas got our fucking family
This is how I represent for my ghetto gangsta niggas
If you want a gangsta girl, holla at a lady, boy

[Hook]
I love gangsta niggas, gangsta niggas love me (yea ho)
Me and the gangsta niggas got our fucking family (yea ho)
This is how I represent for my ghetto gangsta niggas (yea ho)
If you want a gangsta girl, holla at a lady, boy (yea ho)

Yea ho [x4]

[Verse 1: Gangsta Boo]
I'm about that
I be the Gangsta Boo now show me where the gangstas at
So I can put this pussy on them, keep them comin' back
I love my niggas, I'm a ride-or-die and that's a promise
Ain't fucked up 'bout that girl had a threesome with 'em in the Bahamas
He kicked back like a mack, took a puff up off this marijuana
I told my gangster daddy that I'd be forever loyal
The way he drape me up in diamonds, Zsa Zsa Gabor
And if I throw a temper tantrum, he gon' give me more
That's how I rock it when I rock out with my nigga bitch
That's how I represent it, he say that I be the shit
Gangsta niggas, I'll forever be your Gangsta Boo
Just keep it gangsta with me so I can stay true to you
You need me to count your money, baby?
I'mma add it up
And [?] what you got because I'm comin' up
Every gangsta need a gangsta boo, I thought you knew
You know you feel me, need me, want me, babe don't be a fool

[Hook x2]

Yea ho [x4]

[Verse 2: Gangsta Boo]
I'm about that
The gangstas want me on their team because I show that
And they all know that
And I ain't never been no weak girl, always been a gangsta
That don't mean I be a killer girl, I'm just not a wangsta
It don't matter what my [?], I'mma give it to 'em
Keep it gangster at my own speed, I don't play by rules
I'm the mother of the family, but I ain't got no kids
That's the [?] just like gangsta bitches is
Short skirt, heels, cookin' dinner in the kitchen
Put the dope up on the scale
All our money in the digits
Never crossed my gangsta out, especially for another dickin'
I don't like the police, so don't come and ask me shit
Stay true to you
You need me to count your money, baby?
I'mma add it up
And [?] what you got because I'm comin' up
Every gangsta need a gangsta boo, I thought you knew
You know you feel me, need me, want me, babe don't be a fool

Yea ho [x7]

[Hook]

Yea ho [x4]
