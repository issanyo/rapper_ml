[Hook: BeatKing]
Still run the game, ain't shit changed
Laid back in the phantom gettin' brain
New money gonna sank, still get paper
Still fuck haters, ain't shit changed
Ain't shit changed (x2)
Still get paper, still fuck haters, ain't shit changed
Ain't shit changed (x2)
Still get paper, still fuck haters, ain't shit changed

[Verse 1: Gangsta Boo]
Still gettin' money, still gettin' to the check
I'm still shittin' on 'em you'll never see me sweat
I been so record, been had a platinum plaque
The queen of my city other bitches can't do that
The shrimp, the lobster, the sprite with my vodka
You wannabees try it but you busters be imposters
I'm posted in the Caddy down in Houston fucking Texas
I'm clubbin' with the Club Godzilla and do trenches

[Hook: BeatKing]
Still run the game, ain't shit changed
Laid back in the phantom gettin' brain
New money gonna sank, still get paper
Still fuck haters, ain't shit changed
Ain't shit changed (x2)
Still get paper, still fuck haters, ain't shit changed
Ain't shit changed (x2)
Still get paper, still fuck haters, ain't shit changed

[Verse 2: BeatKing]
Still gettin' paper, still trill fuck a hater
Still ridin' slab nigga glass shooting laser
Still comin' down, in my town I wear the crown
If you talking down bitch you get your body found
Still pimpin' bitches, still tippin' inches
I curve your dream bitch, now we can take pictures
Swangin' through South Memhis, hit up Gangsta Boo
15's in the trunk and I'm bangin' screw
I'm not the same as you, you a bitch, bitch I'm rich
If my money low I charge hoes I hit licks
All my cars mine, I drop cash bitch you [?]
And I ain't scared of none of these niggas
I ain't got no tint, cause I still

[Hook: BeatKing]
Still run the game, ain't shit changed
Laid back in the phantom gettin' brain
New money gonna sank, still get paper
Still fuck haters, ain't shit changed
Ain't shit changed (x2)
Still get paper, still fuck haters, ain't shit changed
Ain't shit changed (x2)
Still get paper, still fuck haters, ain't shit changed
