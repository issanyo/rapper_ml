You mean the world to me

You’re overprotective just because you care
You’re overbearing only when you’re not aware
You’re seclusive with the things you don’t want me to know
You’re aggressive when you want it and let your feelings show
If sincere about who you love
If this means your in love with me
I’m afraid of losing you
I’ve fallen in love with you
You mean the world to me
You are my everything
You’re domineering when you’re in control
You’re sincere when you’re silent
Mean while I’m away
I’m addicted to your love
But why are you afraid?
You’re possessive about what belongs to you
You control me with an attitude that says
If this means you love me
I’m afraid of losing you
I’m in love with you

You mean the world to me
You are the universe of stars
Surrounding the galaxy of planets
You light up my world
You mean everything in the world to me
You have a friendly personality
You’re fun to have around
You approach is charming
I love your affection
There are so many reasons
You have my attention
I’m fallen in love
And it’s breaking my heart
If this is what love means
I’m Afraid of us breaking up
I’m afraid of losing you
Cause I’m true to you
Im falling in love with you
Cause I’m true to you


You are the world to me
When I see you hurting inside
With your jealous rage
Envious of who Their lies
You don’t understand what we got
A one in a kind love
We are a team
Like joe and Jan
I’m your #1 fan
We both have wants we have needs
We strive to achieve
No need for jealousy
Let’s talk things through
I’m afraid of losing you
Let’s give it one more try
Let us stay together
And give love one more try
I’m afraid if I leave
Im afraid our relationship is going to die
Afraid if I leave, I’m afraid to stay
I don’t have nowhere to hide my feelings
Are tongue tided
Is it worth one more try?
If it’s worth giving life One more try

You mean the world to me
You are mine
