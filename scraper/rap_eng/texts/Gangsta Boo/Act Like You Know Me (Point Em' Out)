Act like you know me, when I tell that I'm from the North
Act like you know me, when I ask ya let me hit the shorts
Act like you know me, if I holla and front ya boy a key
Act like you know me, when I'm on the track in evergreen
Act like you know me, when you see the platinum on my wrist
Act like you know me, when you know that I done took yo bitch

Act like you know me, rock for rock the record business man
Act like you know me, if I pull the strap and bring the pain
