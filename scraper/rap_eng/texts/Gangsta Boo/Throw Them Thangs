(Verse 1, Lord Infamous)
Ain't no pities for the niggas of the cities, damn ya sign
You got a grind on your mind, I know you sick and tired
You better get up off yo knees, we don't cry nor die
And this time, we gonna go out on a while, with the boldest style
Rockin with the Scarecrow on this chariot of fire
And this time we shall prevail and build our own empire, and you shall learn
There will be no return, we'll watch the cities burn
Understand me, don't come at me, Lord the jammie
Take their mammies and their families and their families; slam
I'm the rudest tootist shoolist boolist "Silence of the Lamb"
Blaaay! Lord from Three 6 land, on a hostile take
Death to the damn fools, who refuse to cooperate
Rollin with this new clique, manage, then I fumble
Let me make this humble, welcome to the jungle!
-Blow!- this world to Kindom Come
I'm the leader of this one, scorpion of Armageddon
