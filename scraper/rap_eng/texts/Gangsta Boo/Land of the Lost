[Verse 1: Gangsta Boo]
To start it off I'm the motherfuckin lady about her cheese
While you other human beings out there leavin fo' free
Kinda quick to tell you what I'm gonna get and it be true
At the end of the rainbow nigga, I thought you knew
Cause I'm stayin on my hustle don't forget I'm on the green
Got a pocket full of money not no stones know what I mean?
Don't get mad cause yo ass livin broke
Fuck that get up off yo lazy ass
Get about yo fuckin scratch

[Verse 2: DJ Paul]
I'm chasin Franklin wit' my Triple 6 thugs
Cause we was sinners I get deeper
I'm still comin up with lint livin in a tent
Some shit gotta change It ain't the same (it ain't the same)
And its plain to see I ain't the same man
Beat a bitch, Rob a ho
Kickin' does from doe to doe
Prophet posse never sloppy
Clean you out from roof to flo'
I'm startin to thinkin' raisin my heartbeat
To never be rich
Bout to change my whole format
Cause of this petty shit

[Verse 3: Juicy J]
It's on! Why you shakin whatcha wanna do
I gotta 357 brand new shootin holes through
Niggas skulls fool Lets get da dope and drop it off
And count them G's and smoke some cheese
It pays to brake the law
My cousin creepin all them graded boys gonna hook us up
To make a grip on that white shit that we don't see or touch
Fuck what you talkin about? We slangin Nigga
By any means, you wanna stop the team we pull the Trigga

[Verse 4: Koopsta Knicca]
Red Red Go away! Koopsta nigga wanna play
Leave me here, chiefin hey
Standin till the last day; You can
Let me wear a briefcase in my situation
So many smilin faces about the devil that's in me racin'
Place in here's a motherfucker, my nigga, I tell ya what
When I was in the jail while my killa was in da cut
All because of this high powered, coward
Bustin that I heat up musta been in love, wanna fill me with slugs

[Verse 5: Crunchy Black]
Its Crunchy Black Crunchy Black
On da creep nigga
How you niggas out here gonna laugh and fuckin giggle?
When I'm gettin bigga and bigga

Picture me in yo dreams when I'm out, ta fuckin getcha
Hit ya fo' ya dividends and fled from da fuckin case
Don't drop no pieces so I, won't catch a case
Make a mistake in dis game and man you'll hafta pay
Deep in the jail cell or holy cell
Never see the day
