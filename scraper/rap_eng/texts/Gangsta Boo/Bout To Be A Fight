[Hook: Lil Wyte]
It's 'bout to be a fight in this club (be a fight in this club)
It's 'bout to be a fight in this club (be a fight in this club)
It's 'bout to be a fight in this club (be a fight in this club)
It's 'bout to be a fight in this club (be a fight in this club)
We gon' snatch them up (stomp 'em down)
And beat them down (stomp 'em down)
We gon' snatch them up (stomp 'em down)
And beat them down (stomp 'em down)
We gon' snatch them up (stomp 'em down)
And beat them down (stomp 'em down)
We gon' snatch them up (stomp 'em down)
And beat them down (stomp 'em down)
Down, down

[Verse 1: Frayser Boy]
All up in the club with a bad bitch
Ni-nigga acting hard, launching, talking cash shit (pussy)
It ain't nothing for one of these niggas to get blasted
Snatched up out the club, now he's sleeping in a casket
You-you-you don't want that, 'cause I guarantee you ain't with it
The street shit I live it, but if you talking cash I get it
I ain't gonna say shit, I'mma show a nigga who to play with
Hit a fuck boy the K bitch, it's a premanent vacation (vacation)
No time to be playing games, I don't fight fair, nigga fuck beef
Re-real nigga I'm from the streets, there ain't one of you niggas gon' fuck with me
Frayser Bizzle hitting first, beat a nigga down
All my niggas with the shit, so don't come around

[Hook: Lil Wyte]

[Verse 2: Gangsta Boo]
Beating bitches like it ain't nothing, give them stitches
Been tearing clubs up, Mosh Pit niggas
Pulling hoes hair, get robbed, get snatched
Pop your head, cartoon locks for that ass
All black on, looking evil with my goons
I don't play fair, and nigga I don't lose
Smoke a lot of weed, kicking blade with my patnas
Mean mugging bitches, if they jump I'mma pop them
Devil shirt on so I'm feeling real dark
Got pistols in the club, got pistols in the car
I ain't claiming killa, but I will fuck you up
Lesbian kitty, play pussy get stuck

[Hook: Lil Wyte]

[Verse 3: Lil Wyte]
Alright, I moved back to Memphis so I just reloaded my clips
And called my dogs, told them let's go hit Beale Street and get fucking senseless
I can't taste this crown, I can't feel my face, I can't see my hands
I can't smell this OG Wyte Kush and I can't hear the band
So I could give a motherfuck about what you do
We roll in the club and set up shop
Fire up the loud, gather some hoes, pull out the molly, fuck the cops
Fuck your side, bitch we run it, always have and always will
Send your girl over here on that bullshit, I'll send that bitch back on a pill
I got boozers with me, shooters with me, fools with me, I got all of the above
Rowdy rednecks in my crew, we'll snatch you up, we don't give a fuck
Lil Wyte I'm still with this shit, Tear Da Club Up before I leave
I'm drunk as hell and I'm high as fuck, that's how we do it here in Tennessee
