[Hook (x5)]
Get down on your knees like a top notch ho
Get down on your knees like a top notch ho (like a pimp)

[Bridge: Gangsta Boo]
What these niggas doing? They [?]
What these niggas doing? They [?]
What these niggas doing? char-chargin' these hoes
What these niggas doing? char-chargin' these hoes

[Verse 1: Gangsta Boo]
Nic nac patty wac give your girl a rack
Imma shake it til my pockets fat, watch me bring it back
I ain't fucking with them other boys, they ain't makin' noise
Don't be fuckin' with them other bitches [?]
Eyes low like I'm chinese, smokin' on some deez
Versace shoes with the six inch, she ain't rockin' these
One please I can give your ass a bitch
Makin' money easy pimpin' hoes, it's serious bitch, Memphis

[Hook (x5)]
Get down on your knees like a top notch ho
Get down on your knees like a top notch ho (like a pimp)

[Verse 2: BeatKing]
Get buck motherfucker, get buck
All my hoes thick as fuck and they gon' charge you to fuck
Flexin' in that fucking Benz with a stripper and her friends
One black, one yella but she look mexican
Club God make her drop it to the floor touch your fuckin' toes
Make your knees touch your elbows, her pussy exposed
One time she gave me head in the backroom
She work at the white clubs too cause she ain't got no tattoos
I called the bitch a bitch and I got rich
Everytime I say pop that pussy I hear the [?]
Thuggin' with Gangsta Boo it's that under-underground
Back up on my bullshit, ridin' slab, comin' down, H-Town

[Hook (x5)]
Get down on your knees like a top notch ho
Get down on your knees like a top notch ho (like a pimp)

[Verse 3: Lil Flip]
See the black drop heading that mean Jefe on the way
This young mack got bread, my snowbunny on the stage
Red bottoms, oxycottons, yellow tuss, purple stuff
Gangsta Boo, BeatKing and Lil Flip that's what's up
Man if she old enough to bleed then she old enough to breath
Excuse me, (my bad) that's the little pimp in me
I got shooters in Memphis and their percentage is tremendous
Cause they don't miss, I still get paid off hits
And she don't wanna be saved, that's why she go both way
I pop my collar like the Fonz, I'm still living happy days
That's Mac-10, that black Benz, that F&N it go bang
Now say 'smoke something bitch' that's for Pimp C mane

[Hook (x5)]
Get down on your knees like a top notch ho
Get down on your knees like a top notch ho (like a pimp)
