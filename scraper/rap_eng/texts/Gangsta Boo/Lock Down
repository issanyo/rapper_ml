[Intro: Koopsta Knicca]
Yeah you know what I'm sayin, these lil flodgin ass niggas
Come down on lower level actin like they hard
Off the street ass punk! yaint bout shit nigga!
Bring that shit to the floor nigga
Got 4 mo muthafuckin days nigga
Go get yo ass delt with biatch!
Nigga gone get yo mufuckin ass put in a piledriver nigga
Bring it to the floor muthafucka
You can't fuck wit dis pimp nigga (woof woof grrrrrrr)
Don't get yo ass put into a motherfuckin piledriver
Like I said aaaaa

[Verse 1: Juicy J]
It started out in 201 lock down, me and Paul in a holding cell
Waitin' to use the fuckin phone, waitin' to get a fuckin bail
Some people think 201 is just a place for cops and robbers
Niggas still smoke weed constantly, passing dollars
Mace in your face when it's time to get buckwild
Cause lawyer fees are high as hell, payin' these can't even help my trial
So while I'm thinkin' to myself, a nigga walked right up to me
Lookin' me up and down with a frown, smellin' like a bottle of Crown
But I dont give a fuck cuz this hoe gon' make me make the news
For shankin' niggas in the neck, whippin' guards and takin' shoes
He threw up a gang sign, I turned my back, didn't pay him no mind
And when I looked around again he threw it up another time
I said "Yo wassup fool, is there somethin that you're tryin' to prove?"
I ain't wit that gang shit, he smiled and fired up a Kool
Walked a little closer to me, I'mma pull them dreads up outta his head
He didn't show no violent act but in a low tone this is what he said:

[Hook]
Killa, Killa, whatcha gonna do?
Get blessed in the red or get blessed in the blue
On the 34th floor they got them G's claimin true
So whatcha gonna do, young killa

[Verse 2: Lord Infamous]
Ya gotta have somebody watchin' somebody else
And them watchin somebody too
While you watchin everybody cuz they ass is out to get you
No matter if you in the dope game or the rap game
Or what situation you're in my friend
There is no such thing as a fuckin friend
Maybe you out to get them, secretly they out to get you
Can't no love be in yo heart, by the way fuck these hoes too
You know they just as devious as negros
That ho don't love yo ass damn fool, if you was broke she'd blow like smoke
And fuck these police ass niggas, snitches pull the sword
Stab you in ya back for a muthafuckin reward
Junky muthafuckers sittin down at the precinct
Lookin at pictures trying to indentify a nigga
On the realla man, this game is so filthy
And everybody guilty, niggas start to tripping
So keep extra clips, see
Man, trust is somethin that I never had much faith in
Cuz fuckin' wit niggas you will end up in the state pen

[Hook]
Killa, Killa, whatcha gonna do?
Get blessed in the red or get blessed in the blue
On the 34th floor they got them G's claimin true
So whatcha gonna do, young killa

[Verse 3: DJ Paul]
Yeah, aww shit they shine them blues up on my candy
They said somebody done dropped the dime but these playa hatas can't stand me
And now my burbons on the record at about eleven
In the back of the car, Im hope'n I see tha 9-7-11
.45 they done brought that dog
Me and Crunchy eye to eye while chris be stuffin his draws
I heard a rumor that damn hound done found my stash pot
I had four juice 'o blow and a infared on my .40 and a Glock
Aww fuck, we on our way to the duece 01 [201]
This shit was cool to rap about but now it ain't so fun
But little do they know ben's made friends
I had to spend plenty of em but we ain't seein no payin at least this shit

[Verse 4: Gangsta Boo]
Nigga let me ask you are you really down wit yo gang
Or when you get locked up do that shit change?
Now I'm comin real, tryna know the deal bout you killas
Are you just some shiesty niggas that hang around drug dealers
When yo ass be locked up, hoe do you be like doin chores?
For so cockin that you in like BD's and Vice Lords
Let this lady kick some knowledge for niggas that's full of flodgin
Its guaranteed to get fucked up by them real mobsters
Killa killa killa whatcha gonna do, is yo color red or blue
You fucked up, you gonna get stuck up because you ain't true
For that simple reason, found you shakin, bleedin, in yo cell
Now yo ass done bought a one way ticket to a burnin hell

[Outro: Crunchy Black & DJ Paul]
Yeah for you niggas that's thinkin that 201 is a joke
(a muthafuckin game)
You muthafuckas (watch you back nigga)
A nigga need to work that trunk ho
Rock man, rock man let me get some rock man
(rock man pass the muthafuckin Kool-aid bitch!!)
