Verse 1
Let's take a trip
Back to the 90's
Loced out smoked out
Prophet fucking posse
Honeycomb hideout
Where them weed bongs at?
Dressed like a little thug
Where my real niggas at?
Everybody fuck with Boo
I'm the crazy fucking lady
Bitch with a attitude
Still fuck you pay me man
I dropped out of school
But still had a Caddy truck
In the studio with Triple fucking Six
Getting buck what the fuck
You gone tell me
Man I'm getting money
Put my city on the map
Before they switched up on me
I ain't never gone change
Imma always do me
Cause it's easy as fuck
What the hell I'm posed to be

Hook
I thought
They say they want that real back
Yeah I gotcha
They say they want a trill bitch around
Then I gotcha
We gone take it back to 1999
Boy this shit feel like it's 1999
They say they miss that Yeah Hoe
Then I got ya
They say they want that old Boo back
Then I got ya
Man this shit feel like it's 1999
Imma take it back to 1999

Verse 2
Hung with the dope boys on a hot ass street
Called Eldridge Hollywood, North Memphis Tennessee
Where they deep
Niggas be packing that heat
Sometimes I couldn't even sleep
Cause of the them bombs
Niggas was bussing them guns
I guess they just wanted to eat cool
But I had something else to do
I wrote a fucking rap or two
Then I moved up out the hood
And took a fucking flight or two
Acting like you know me
Ain't gone help you when my patience up
I was always taught them niggas ain't tough
You get into some Gangsta stuff
We don't play with other folks kids
We get it how we live
Gold grills and we trill
Disciples in the house
Imma bring this shit back
The underground rap muthafucka

Hook
I thought
They say they want that real back
Yeah I gotcha
They say they want a trill bitch around
Then I gotcha
We gone take it back to 1999
Boy this shit feel like it's 1999
They say they miss that Yeah Hoe
Then I got ya
They say they want that old Boo back
Then I got ya
Man this shit feel like it's 1999
Imma take it back to 1999
