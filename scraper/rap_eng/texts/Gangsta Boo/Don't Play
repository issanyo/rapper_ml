You know I would leave your ass in the past. (Vroom)
I'm bout that fast life, that cash life, that gansta shit
Hey come take a trip on my road to the riches to see what it is
Dope girls come and take a ride with me, yeah ho

[A.ware]
Stacked up, bitches in my condo
You ain't talking bout shit, get the fuck about my convo
Bravo, que passo, for my niggas inside of that locked joint
I been standing the rain so long, I dont give a fuck about a poncho
Bring that thunderstorm in and your money making dormant
I be on that paper chasing, bitch look at my fortress
Slanging on the porsches, thumbing through the nearest check
My bitch is so gorgeous, she don't show you no respect
You a fuck nigga, thats the bottom line
In this thug shit, its just an alibi
While they try to ratatat with a nigga, matter fact
Take these couple stacks and go and double that

[Corey Davis]
Everytime I walk around the city niggas know it's me
With my bottom bitch, I got hard dick for her ovaries
I could never love a ho, even if she fucks for free
Calculator, counting dough. Twist it, light it, puffing tree
Uncle Keny was a pimp, Mama was a dope girl
Granny said I could get anything, "It's your world."
Daddy was on crack rock, Uncle June was off in jail
So I grew up on my own, climbed up out that wishing well
And now Im living well, see my enemies in hell
Waiter let me get some quail. Escargot, Im eating snail
Turn the party up, your pussy, I just took it
That ho kept on looking, all my niggas jookin. (Yeah ho.)
