[Intro: DJ Paul]
*Laughter*
Yeah, y'all thought that underground shit wouldn't gon' work, didn't ya? Yeah....
For the wages of sin is death
For the gift of god is eternal life
Through Jesus Christ our lord
Roman 6-23 nigga, read it and weep, biatch!
*Laughter*

[Verse 1: Koopsta Knicca]
Hitman bustin' up in my door, so I grab my 44
Now them bustas on the floor, covered up by pillows
Oh no, I'm lookin' for them tr'izz'icks
Tryin' to put Koop in they cl'izz'ick
I'm comin' up quick, I'm takin' no shots
Bustin' these caps off in these bitches
So why you wanna mess with this
So why you wanna take off this piece
Fool I'm bad to the bone, jone, chrome tech (??) fatality
You'll be fled, I'll be glad
When I make you hit that grass
I ain't showin' no mercy
God damn it I'm blastin' that ass
I'm havin' visions of flesh (??) like that roozer tech
That mess in my head
If the constantly tempting this evil shit
You hear some laughin', who's that in yo window gaspin'?
Now if you feel me tell me whose that creepin' for your head

[Verse 2: Gangsta Boo]
This goes out to all of you suckas
Includin' you crossers
Includin' you bustas
This shit is so fucked up
I can't even trust ya
This lady is tired of you motherfuckers
I'm bumpin' so hard
It's like oh my god
Gangsta Boo is rippin' the mic all apart
If your ass wasn't so full of that flaudge
Never would you have tested me from the start
I'm trying to tell you ho
Let me tell you bitch
You ain't my fuckin' friend
Prophet Entertainment member known as Boo
Had to tell your ass time and time again
Ride with my click
Bitch Triple 6
Is all I need plus my weed and the n-i-n-e
To keep you frilly hoes off of me
Come into my face
With that pimpin' ass shit
Watch you see this gangsta bitch get scandolous
You friendly ass hoes I scratch off my list
I don't need you
Don't want you bitch

[Verse 3: Crunchy Black]
Friends like foes in these hoes
Keep on talkin' that shit
Actin' like they bad as fuck
But they ain' really talkin' 'bout shit
Keep on dissin' this click
And we gonna hurt one of you tricks
Put your body in a ditch
Or dig a grave for that shit
Don't you ask who like it
Crunchy Blac did it bitch
Keep on talkin' all that noise
And I'mma get big like big business

[Chorus x4: Lord Infamous]
I have to tell these niggas time and time again
Bitch I ain't your fuckin' friend, I'll do your ass in

[Verse 4: DJ Paul]
Smiles can be deceivin', even if it's your friends
And hoes that know we can't be even Steven
Should not believe in
Too late one of them slip it's my foes
You already got my Glock to the back of your head
Prayers already said, done consider yourself dead
Your family and friends might be sayin' that I crossed you out
But nigga you was fake from the beginning
So I had to toss you out
Friend I'm no more, I kill all you foes
Step in my trunk, once again on a stroll
Forty mag to yo back
The hammer release and leave your chest with holes
All in the club with that buck ass shit
You want the mic? Then I'mma slap you with the mic, bitch
You couldn't rock it with a test tube and a pot
It's kind of hard, you can't beat us
And you can't join us
Cause we ain't gonna stop if you don't stop

[Verse 5: Lord Infamous]
Some of the superior astronomical bends
From that of my mystical dreams
Of the many scenes
Mighty, manipulative, merciless, multiple murderers
Imagine dangerous hittin' the strip' and a critical injury
Misery, seriously witness the tremoring
Tragedy, agony, infamy, agony brutal mentality
Assassatain
My voodoo tribe
If he wants to be fried put on a friendly disguise
Lord Infamous takin' no prisoners
Forget the begging, pleading, and the cries
Your reservation revalation
A satanic nation has been prophesized
I can look in your eyes and tell that there is fear
From the eternal burning of each of your lies
Flights of headlights, black clothes and limos
Another negro startin' to decompose
On his casket the Scarecrow shall place him a lovely black rose
Who knows the hate that goes behind closed doors
With corpses froze in six foot holes
Wicked souls, evil flows and torturing of foes

[Chorus x4: Lord Infamous]
I have to tell these niggas time and time again
Bitch I ain't your fuckin' friend
I'll do your ass in

[Outro: DJ Paul]
Yeah, I ain't your fuckin' friend
We'll do your ass here nigga
*Laughter*
Three 6 mafia comin' at your ass for the 9-7, bitch!
Yeah... watch your back niggas!
You know who you are motherfucker!
Thought that underground shit wouldn't gon' work, didn't ya?
*Laughter*
