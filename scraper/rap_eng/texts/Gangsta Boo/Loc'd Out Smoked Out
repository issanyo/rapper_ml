[Chorus]
Loc'd out, smoked out (16x)

[Verse 1: Gangsta Boo]
Man, I love to smoke good
I ain't never been cheap
Black 10, [?], we are on some 90's shit
Gangsta Boo, with the gas mask
Put on your face
Cough and choke
Bet your ass won't be tryna win this place
I got dead on arrival, high as fuck
Outer space, you better get your Bible
'Cause you gon' need a lotta prayer
Eyes are red
Got me super slick, I'm flick
I'm in this bitch
'Bout to hit a lick, they hit, the crypt
To flip my crumbs to [?]
Speakin' of flips, I'm thinkin' of takin' a trip
I ain't trippin, you wanna get trippy?
Fuckin' with Boo, [?]
Doin' a toast to the good highs and the bad highs
You know time fly when you in the sky
I always think about Lord Infamous, Koopsta Knicca till the next time

[Chorus]
Loc'd out, smoked out (x16)

[Verse 2: Gangsta Boo]
Man, you know I keep it lit
I ain't never been a lightweight
Like that motivation, then I pour some inspiration (Hey!)
Fucked around, smoked you under the table
That's where you were found
Underground is where I reside and I ain't gon' change my sound
I'm smoked out
When I be coughin', I wear my shades to be loc'd out
Gold in my mouth
Keepin' it trillin's a statement we say in the south
80's babies, 90's babies, [?]
Got me super blisted, twisted 'bout to hit the curb
Headin' to the Mississippi River down in Memphis
Brought some Cali blunt to smoke out with my gangster bitches
[?] cause I'm real with all my business
And you can get the business if you come between my riches

{Chorus]
I'm loc'd out, smoked out
Loc'd out smoked out (x16)

Get it how we live, gold grills and we trill (x8)

Undergroup rap (x12)
