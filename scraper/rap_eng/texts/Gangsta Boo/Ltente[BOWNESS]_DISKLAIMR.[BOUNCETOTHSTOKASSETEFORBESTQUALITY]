[Verse 1: Lord Infamous]
Let me just take you somewhere secret
Gonna cut all of the lights down dim, forget all
About your world, we gonna just flow wit what we feel, let's share all
You're private thoughts, I'm not just
Out for your sex, let me simp-
-Lify the things in life that
You find complex, forget what
You heard bout me, cause you're a
Scarecrow groupie, but there's no
Pressure on you, cause you know
What you must do, check this out
Let's have a drink, and I'll give
You time to think, let me puff
This Buddha blunt and cut on
This porno bump, girl come lounge
Here by my side, tonight you're
My Devil's bride, and as a
Freak deep inside, have no shame
No need to hide, why do you
Keep on blushing it-it off
Like a slut, she-she must be
Kind of tipsy on this Chrystal like a gypsy
Now I got
Her on all fours, bout to break
Down the head-board, crash this broad
On through the wall, now she houndin' like a dog
Sweat poured
We hit the floor, it don't quit
Another one ripped
It's just another victim of Lord Infamous
Late night tip...

[Hook: Lord Infamous & Gangsta Boo]
[I'm not the type to get involved in long relationships (Why?)
Taking trips and buying gifts, I'm sorry I'm not on that tip
(What?)
If you want romance, you should just think who you already with (Okay)
If you in that mood, you can just hit me on that late night tip (Ohh)

[Verse 2: DJ Paul & Gangsta Boo]
I done seen
Some funny shit since I got in this game
They wants my crib
They wants my kids since I done gots my fame
I never recall you askin' ya last boyfriend for nathin'
But now the big, 'Burban on golds got'cha aggrivated
I need a coach bag
I can't be even doing it
I need my hair done
Me too, I ain't got nothin' to do wit it
I been through wit it, you 'n it
Since the first time ya asked
And might I add
Playas like me can't be savin you rags

[Verse 3: Gangsta Boo]
I ain't with that non-sense
Or that lovey-dovey mess
Feeling kind of freaky
Late night calling 'cause you got the best
Slip on Victoria Secrets
Hit the liquor store before it close
Call Chris so I can get something white to throw up in my nose
No I'm feeling fine
Freaking you out is on my mind
Let me get up on your pony like your name was Ginuwine
Got you caught up in the mix
Mystic girl from Triple-Six
Late night tip is all we had
You just came, so trick that's it (That's it)
