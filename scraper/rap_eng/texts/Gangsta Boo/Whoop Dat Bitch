[Intro]

[Chorus - Koopsta Knicca & Gangsta Boo]
Punk ass nigga constantly talking that shit
Gonna fucking come up missing, gon' get found in a ditch
I'll whoop that bitch, I'll hurt that hoe (bring it)
Whoop that bitch, I'll hurt that hoe
And after the club, constantly running his mouth
Trying to tell this motherfucking nigga
I'll whoop that bitch, I'll hurt that hoe (bring it)
Whoop that bitch, I'll hurt that hoe

[Verse 1 - Koopsta Knicca]
Koop back up in this hoe, I'm 'bout to lose control
We beat 'em to the floor, for that, man, they don't know
These hoes - they think they bad, we beem 'em up real fast
You touch me, bitch - I'll beat your ass
'Bout your crew I serve them, so take this as a learner
Too hot trick for a burner (it's a murder, murder, murder, murder)
Heard this shirt through this birch that this dirk want to whoop me so
Blood on my pants, all on my clothes, oh no
Here we go, body blows, bitch, Koop like to fight
Fuck that shit, I'm alright, special effects sitting up in my car right
Off the heezy, got this heat to your gut
Bitch, too buck for this club, let the .40 cal bust
Come in, jump in
The wind, my friend
The club, crunk up
Yes sir, say what

[Chorus - Koopsta Knicca & Gangsta Boo]
Punk ass nigga constantly talking that shit
Gonna fucking come up missing, gon' get found in a ditch
I'll whoop that bitch, I'll hurt that hoe (bring it)
Whoop that bitch, I'll hurt that hoe
And after the club, constantly running his mouth
Trying to tell this motherfucking nigga
I'll whoop that bitch, I'll hurt that hoe (bring it)
Whoop that bitch, I'll hurt that hoe

[Verse 2 - Gangsta Boo]
Dog, look, I be spranging on niggas, ask snipe
First a left then an uppercut, mighty quick right
You silly ass niggas be talking that yang, but I bet you won't swang
I got my slingshot blau-blau-blau to the brain
I'm the U, the G, the Q, the South
I get crunk as fuck bowing bitches in their mouth
If you wanna try me, mane, step up to my face, mane
I'm tired of you niggas talking shit about this player, mane
Busta ass niggas wanna act like they want some
Baby, I like pulling triggers for fun, get me real mad - you better run
Run like Forrest, pimping, I'm the hardest
The roughest, the baddest, bitch, you ain't mad, is ya?
Bro, I'm like a hollow point coming fast as hell
Street ringers run the streets like the dawn of the dead
Yeah, I'm blowing like dyno, weakest link - good bye, hoe
Whoop that bitch, hurt that hoe
March, trick, step into this motherfucking mask
Gangsta Boo will be the last one standing, know that

[Chorus - Koopsta Knicca & Gangsta Boo]
Punk ass nigga constantly talking that shit
Gonna fucking come up missing, gon' get found in a ditch
I'll whoop that bitch, I'll hurt that hoe (bring it)
Whoop that bitch, I'll hurt that hoe
And after the club, constantly running his mouth
Trying to tell this motherfucking nigga
I'll whoop that bitch, I'll hurt that hoe (bring it)
Whoop that bitch, I'll hurt that hoe

[Verse 3 - Koopsta Knicca]
Touch me - you're gonna fry, ebonics, mane, there's no lie
On your shirt I see red dye, other words cherry pie
I beat jack out the frame, the Koopsta Knic's gone insane
Bad for your health, lil' mane, something like ana hang
Angered man lives a took, uppercut, then a left, right hook
Trick, this your last look, gon' get your bitch ass whooped
Whooped and shoved in the parking lot, up with yellow sparks
AK shells ripped him 'part, the sawed-off shells pushed him far
This here could be your brother, uncle, neph' or your lover
See, death is what he discovered, the Koop is a motherfucker
Gunning, man, they start running, man down, but ain't none funny
You shouldn't have bumped me, homie, like I'm a bitch or something
Not depressed, but I'm suppressed to get the ang' off my chest
Thou once slept in a casket, when I awoke I start blasting, blasting

[Chorus x2 - Koopsta Knicca & Gangsta Boo]
Punk ass nigga constantly talking that shit
Gonna fucking come up missing, gon' get found in a ditch
I'll whoop that bitch, I'll hurt that hoe (bring it)
Whoop that bitch, I'll hurt that hoe
And after the club, constantly running his mouth
Trying to tell this motherfucking nigga
I'll whoop that bitch, I'll hurt that hoe (bring it)
Whoop that bitch, I'll hurt that hoe
