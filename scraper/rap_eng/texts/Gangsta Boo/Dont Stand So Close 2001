[Hook 8X]
Don't stand, don't stand so close to me

[Verse 1: Gangsta Boo]
Rip you bitches mugs off
Lookin at me fire hot
Rollin wit my brother E
Take me to your stash spot
Queen of Memphis reppin
Crazy lady steppin
Comin wit tha automatic chrome tone weapon
Nigga yah you know the biz
What you in my face for
Add teeth gold bracelet wit tha fuckin bezzle
Cruisin wit tha limo
Tint on my window
Pop a half X
Now I'm ready to get felt on
On my way to New York
Get the latest fashion
Head on back to Memphis
Hit the Pure Passion
Shake it shake your ass bitch
Sexy fine thang you
Mad hoes always got something about the Gangsta Boo
Catch me at the Grammy's
Wit a blunt, runnin shit
Fuck you sissy bitches

Sissy boy wit no heart
A lot of punks

Wanna holla

A classy playa from the North
Wit a bag of good

Pint of gin
Rollin through the hood
If I seem a little hot

You betta catch up witcho kind
And fuck wit somebody else

[Verse 5: DJ Paul]
Now I'm a lock you in the fuckin trunk
While I hit the fuckin funk
Now I'm goin crazy boy
