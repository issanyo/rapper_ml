[Chorus: MC Ren]
You don't know me, a record can't tell ya
You don't know me, a record can't tell ya
You don't know me, a record can't tell ya
You don't know me, a record can't tell ya

[Verse 1: Lord Infamous]
Torture til they gone, never stay alone, killas, laser chrome
Hunting in the zone, where the enemies roam
Massacre the town, fire all yo rounds, make 'em all fall down
Please don't make a sound, hear the Devil growl
Please don't go to sleep, never go to sleep
You may not awake
Cause I'm goin to take you deep down beneath
The Scarecrow's in the woods, creeping through the woods
Creeping through yo hood, please don't be so scared
Go and take a look
I got behind the steel, may I be forgived, I didn't mean to kill
Now I wipe your bone and blood off my windshield
I'm sitting in the park, fire on the logs, watching body parts
Burning into sparks, bloodied up my saw
Lord Infamous is me, psychopathically, driven in the mind
Seek and you shall find my evil is blind
Cause I give a fuck less, color of your flesh, I just want to mess
Up your fuckin' chest with my jet black tech

[Chorus: MC Ren]
You don't know me, a record can't tell ya
You don't know me, a record can't tell ya
You don't know me, a record can't tell ya
You don't know me, a record can't tell ya

[Verse 2: Gangsta Boo]
Playa what you know about the south side?
Not a damn thing, but yo ass do not realize
South is takin over, nigga, squashin all this bullshit
North, east, west, it's all good, gotta represent
Comin with the quickness
Oh my goodness, it's this gangsta bitch
Never solo only roll with niggas down with Triple 6
What you gettin jealous fo?
Nigga you don't know me so
Busta it's a mafia world, Mafia makin money ho

[Verse 3: Juicy J]
Yeah, this Triple 6 Mafia click it's real
Fool it ain't nothin fake
We tote them Glocks and keep them cocked
And never hestitate
You wanna run up to this click and talk that flaudgin' shit
And have yo ass tied up and thrown away off in a ditch
Or see me bitch, drop to yo feet while you flow 20 deep
Deep in the Mississippi River wrapped up in a sheet
And then ya know the Last Man Standin can't be you or me
How could fuck with this and my fuckin N-i-n-e?
BEEYATCH!

[Chorus: MC Ren]
You don't know me, a record can't tell ya
You don't know me, a record can't tell ya
You don't know me, a record can't tell ya
You don't know me, a record can't tell ya

[Verse 4: DJ Paul]
The Last Man Standin'll never be part of the B.O.N.E
Comin from that ? 4-0, searchin for my enem-eny
Niggas tryin to come quick, shut it up you fixin to die trick
40 caliber, gonna rowdy ya to the brains, you fixin to die, bitch
Huh, in the Mid-south we cannot see ya
Mane never wanna be ya
When you come up out that Chevy with yo draws off
Sawed-offs we be aimin, never with yo games-es
Automatic my brains is, shootin yo fuckin brains in
Three 6 mutha fuckin Mafia, fools we gon rocket ya
Wanna after party ain't no stoppin us
Comin from the M, ain't no love for her or him
Here's a blast from that blast
Man I doubt ya even last in the past
You thought you had some characters, fuckin the wrong click
6 niggas gonna carry ya, I bury ya
Bitches alive after the rest of my demands
The Three 6 Mafia, the last to stand
After the war is over

[Chorus: MC Ren]
You don't know me, a record can't tell ya
You don't know me, a record can't tell ya
You don't know me, a record can't tell ya
You don't know me, a record can't tell ya

[Verse 6: Gangsta Blac]
Deuce, deuce down, drinkin crown with the Texas thugs
Scrugs, ain't no love, catch me slummed of them fuckin drugs
Boys Club bound, lost and found, biggest man around
Never try to break me down, .380 gon' fuckin clown
You don't know this nigga
What malt liquor got you thinkin strange?
Rico with that four-four through the d-izz-oor
You don't know this man
G-a-n-g-s-t-a, bitch, glorified shit, trick
Ain't no need for this cause a man will kill you quick
Nigga!

[Verse 7: M-Child]
It's almost nightfall, let me slip on my murderer mug
A smile to a frown make a nigga think that I'm on drugs
Orange Mound where I be, Mack M-Child is who I be
A young to arrested got you stressin to my mystery
Psycho kids split yo wig, all over the mighty dollar
Fuckin with my Devil this ho let the steam up out yo collar
Comin deep, Mafia deep, puttin you niggas to fuckin sleep
A bomb in yo pager, now watch it blow when the Child beep
BITCH!

[Chorus: MC Ren]
You don't know me, a record can't tell ya
You don't know me, a record can't tell ya
You don't know me, a record can't tell ya
You don't know me, a record can't tell ya
