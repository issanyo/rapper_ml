SameOldShawn: Everyone sounds like they're from Memphis all of a sudden

Gangsta Boo: It's so weird. Honestly it's really really weird. To be honest, it's really weird. It's insulting, in a way. You know I'm a girl, so I have my feminine ways. I'm one to lash out, which is cool -- thank god I'm a girl so they can send me out to lash out at people. It'll look cool, it won't be look like "Oh you a dude, sit down, that's some female shit." No, I'm lashing out. Because sometimes I think it's disrespectful, because a lot of times when people do it, they don't pay homage. And it's not necessarily about paying homage but I'm overhearing the "Yeah, ho" sample. Like "Yeah, ho!" I'm so over hearing that sample. We did that on Triple 6 Mafia albums so long ago. And it's so cool because that's what's popping now, but I'm in agreement with you -- a lot of people have definitely taken in the Memphis ways. Because nobody paid us no attention!

SameOldShawn: Right, that's the weird thing! You know, '95, '96 or whatever when you were just starting out...

Gangsta Boo: Or even in 2000. I mean, you know, people just really started tuning in because you got the Yo Gottis and people must have forgotten the 8Ball & MJGs that was out before us, you know
