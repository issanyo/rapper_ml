Say, suck a nigga dick or something

Say, suck a nigga dick or something

Say, suck a nigga dick or something
Eat a little cat or something

[Verse One: Juicy J]
Slide for my cat
Cause you know it's phat
Check in wit me
Nigga and do dat
Get on yo' knees
Do it as you please
Head to da bank
Get all yo' cheese
Now if I could, I would
But since I can't, ho I ain't
Bend ova badder 500
But don't scratch up my paint
I need my monsta sucked, please
While I ride down the highway
2 lanes, dead ends, by-ways & express-ways
I know a bitch
That suck dicks
She blow ass
She lick clits
She stay around the corner from me
Huh, I'm just down on Evergreen Street
Wit my niggas
All university
Bustin' this freestyle
Freakin' the beat
All these hoes, I can't trust ya
You wanna be loved
You the kinda bitch that put a whole in the rug

[Hook]

[Verse Two: Gangsta Boo]
Eat a little cat or something, boy
Bring your ass on
Calling you at home to make sure that your ass gone
I know you wit that whipped cream shit
That freaky shit
Oops, I heard you use cough-drops (mmm)
That kinky shit nigga
I know the game cause your boys do the same thing
Pussy biting niggas call them ballas fo' an alias name
What a shame
How y'all trying to hide yo' true identity
Knowing that the pussy is your friend
Not your enemy
How you gonna knock it when you came out one?
You know you get some mo' ass then a hostage son
Now let me say a little something for you boys & girls
I'm not your typical girl, I got mo' nuts than squirrels
So if you wanna comfort me
I will comfort you too
So open up real wide
Let my juices get you high boo
Take the words of wisdom
That this gangsta bitch be spitting
All you niggas eat pussies
Why don't you go admit it boo

[Hook]

[Verse Three: D.J. Paul]
You got me jigglin' baby
Wit the quickness of your tongue
Screwin' like the movie cause you got it goin' on
Now nigga bad boy
Doin' your job like a pro
You done freaked down da show
Like Vanessa Del Rio
Vanessa Del Rio
She said my dick was too big
That's why I'm peepin' out one like Missy Elliott, big
Satisfaction, I need
I fuck a ho 'til they bleed
From Rhythm & Des'ree
She'll be tattooed on yo' knee
Whatever nigga
Sayin' shit for da hoes that you're fuckin' wit
6-9 on your pager, got yo' ass callin' it
Nigga
So what da fuck can you say about it baby?
No late nights
It be a lady on a mission to make you crazy
Well I'm Too Hot For TV
I'm too cold for a freezer
Hit me on my 800
Your little dirty dick teaser
I should do life in jail
For the way I rizip a cat
So let's see mack up out the ho
And she got kidnapped

[Hook]
