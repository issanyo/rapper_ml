[Hook: Lex Luger]
Smokin' marijuana all in public
You would think that shit was legal
I just went and bought a Bentley coupe
That shit boosted up my ego
I got me a freak ho, she boosted up my ego
She boost her niggas ego   

[Verse 1: Gangsta Boo]
I boost that nigga ego up, he bought me a Range Rove'
Put my pussy on his lips, he kissed it with his eyes closed
[?] counts stacks of cash and bags that I just made off tour
Travel through the snow and then get it
I'm a hustler, baby, and that's for sure
Pay no attention to wack bitches
I can't see from the side, I got tunnel vision
Where they do that at? Not over here on this side of Memphis
Smokin' with some veterans, not in Cali but still got my medicine
Been fucked up and let me back in again
Like Kevin Durant, I am gonna win
Performing in TomorrowWorld blew my fuckin' mind
If you ain't heard of that then you really are behind
Triple 6 'til the death of it, call me Wicked Witch
Private planes, money, cars, the fame, makin' number hits

[Hook]

[Bridge: Lex Luger]
She ain't just for me, though
She boost my niggas ego
We out in Puerto Rico
Flooded with the migo
30 thousand on a nigga
I'm a walkin' kilo

[Verse 2: Lex Luger]
Jumped into this game with no pot to piss in
Now my baby mama shoes made by Christian
Louboutin, who is him? He never bought a Benz
Lex Luger here, we in the field, I never disappeared
Accomplish what you want to but you can't
I am sponsored by Mr. Thomas and Ben Frank
Your baby mama is in my sauna, we havin' dranks
Pull out that llama, you with that drama over that skank
I hit and run, when I smash, I'm done
Bitch, I ain't the one, wanna have my son?
Ho, you must be drunk or you just playin' dumb
I just wanna have fun, I just came here to cum
Can it be on your tongue? Can you call up your friends?
Do they wanna have fun? We can soak in the sun
Walkin' out of Fulton County, Gucci shoes on
Feels like every time I'm doin' right, something goes wrong
I just popped that Xanax and it was the whole bar
I don't have anxiety so motherfuck' the law
