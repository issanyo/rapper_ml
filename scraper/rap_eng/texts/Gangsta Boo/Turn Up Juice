Turn up juice, turn up, turn up juice
Turn up juice, turn up, turn up juice

[Verse 1: A.ware]
Sipping on some turn up
Don’t need to carry no burner
'Cause the goon squad behind me
2 bitches, that's siamese
Asian chick that’s Chun Lee
Old hoe, Kimora Lee
That's your chick? I put that pimping right off in her face
Now she telling you I’m the illest off in the interstate
Throwing shots of brown down
Double shots of that Nino Brown
Niggas acting like they know how
To put it down like I but they some clowns
Sipping on that turn up juice
You're main chick might turn up loose
Super Saiyan slam dunk
Corey throw the alley hoop


[Chorus]
That’s that turn up juice
Pass that turn up juice
That’s that turn up juice
Pass that turn up juice
That’s that turn up juice
Pass that turn up juice
Turn up juice, turn up, turn up juice
Turn up juice, turn up, turn up juice
Turn up juice, turn up, turn up juice
Turn up juice, turn up, turn up juice
Turn up juice, turn up, turn up juice
Turn up juice, turn up, turn up juice

[Verse 2: Gangsta Boo]
Vodka and Redbull get me loose
Fuck it I want me some turn up juice
Turn up juice, turn up, turn up juice
Turn up juice, turn up, turn up juice
Bout to hit the club with all my girls
Have me some fun, take over the world, bitch
On that turn up juice, on that, on that turn up juice
Big booty posted on the wall on the club
You ain’t got no money you can't get no love
I don’t really have a lot of time for your games
A real bitch like me don’t want no lames
You heard what I said, I love having sex
But I’d rather get some bread, pimping ain’t dead
On that turn up juice, pimping, we on that turn up juice
Boo!

[Chorus]
That’s that turn up juice
Pass that turn up juice
That’s that turn up juice
Pass that turn up juice
That’s that turn up juice
Pass that turn up juice
Turn up juice, turn up, turn up juice
Turn up juice, turn up, turn up juice
Turn up juice, turn up, turn up juice
Turn up juice, turn up, turn up juice
Turn up juice, turn up, turn up juice
Turn up juice, turn up, turn up juice

[Verse 3: Corey]
Niggas always hating on the kid
If it isn’t who I am then it’s something that I did
Need to get me out your head
Before I come and split your wig
Y’all be smoking on that mid
And I be smoking big blunts
My cuz just caught a bid but
He’ll be back in 6 months
They gotta tell me what he did
I’ma hold him down
It’s them niggas that he making moves
While you slowing down
Take my set and throw it up
Take your hood and throw it down
Then take your bitch and walk away
Y’all can keep on talking
I’ma flick a Bic and spark a jay
Posted in the parking lot, yeah you know the shit knock
Hit the club and have that shit jumping like a skip rock
Sipping on some turn up, bag of skittles in my sock

[Chorus]
That’s that turn up juice
Pass that turn up juice
That’s that turn up juice
Pass that turn up juice
That’s that turn up juice
Pass that turn up juice
Turn up juice, turn up, turn up juice
Turn up juice, turn up, turn up juice
Turn up juice, turn up, turn up juice
Turn up juice, turn up, turn up juice
Turn up juice, turn up, turn up juice
Turn up juice, turn up, turn up juice
