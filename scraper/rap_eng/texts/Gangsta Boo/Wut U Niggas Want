[Verse 1]
Yo! Hangin' low, chiefin' high
Time to make you haters cry
Circulatin' gossip 'bout the Lady you deserve to die
Memphis Queen will set it off
Never ever play me soft
Always 'bout my business, be a witness while I write you off
Please stop beepin' me, since I fuck you won't stop beepin' me
Is it cause you sippin' on that syrup or takin' ecstasy?
I don't wanna play wit you, Mrs. Villain Gangsta Boo
Got no time for you cause I be busy with my fuckin' crew
Out to get some paper and you know just how the ball bounce
Yellin' "Fuck a hater!" Blowin' hydro smoke up out my mouth
Ridin' with the limo tint, system bumpin' triple 6
Just a lovely lady independent tryin' to make it rich
Just to let you know I peep you out and how you look at me
Ballin' in yo' friends Mercedes, smiling like you foolin' me
Never are you foolin' me, Ladies represent with me
How you got the clout when, nigga, you be out here chasin' me?

[Hook x2]
What these niggas want from a bitch?
(what you want)?
What these niggas want from a bitch?
(really want)

[Verse 2]
What you niggas want from a bitch
You niggas makin' me sick
Be actin' like you a baller just to get in my shit
Cause a lady ( I ) she don't want no scrubs
A scrub is a nigga that can get the fuck from me
And glistenin' in yo' white gold chains
Saw me ridin' in the Benz nigga doin' my thang
So I don't need you. I got my car keys plus a check book
Two way constantly jumpin' sendin' me messages "Boo, I love you"
Anyway playa I'mma say whats on my fuckin mind
I don't give a fuck what you write I ain't fantizin'
OK got a car, OK got that ice, OK nigga cool shit ya life is aight
Now what ya wife be tellin me ya business my nigga
I don't care about your figures, I'm a playa my nigga
I'mma mack till I fall ya'll, keepin' it tight
So tell me why you wanna get with Mrs. Lady Aight?
