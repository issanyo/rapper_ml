[Verse 1: Gangsta Boo]
Bloody bodies in the yard like a zombie apocalypse
The Walking Dead I'm so so scared
And I don't know how to get up out this bitch
As I creep these ghetto streets looking for a feast
Some may bleed cause my eyes are red
Hail Mary me
Look up at the sky
Nigga it's do or diz-ie
I did not make up the rules
I don't wanna lose my cool, don't be playin' when shit hits the fan
Better drop it off and then strip me on demand
This be that gangsta music, that make the bitches lose it
But it's all good cause I grew up on that hood shit
Started out at 14 when I joined the Triple Six
Bitches be hating cause' we be so paid and it's
Hard not to kill all you pussy hoes hatin' the hollerin' be hardly the
One not do it not claim I'll kill you but it's nothin' to it!

[Hook]
Just come off of dat paper bitch
Just come of dat paper bitch
I put that pistol to your temple
Just come of dat paper bitch
Just come of dat paper bitch

[Verse 2: BeatKing]
Club God back up in this bitch
On that Mysic Stylez shit
RIP Lord Infamous
Enter this mind of this lunatic
Straight out the H
Where they chop
And they screw that shit up
Vampin' with your slut
She told me that she gon' fuck and go suck
We rape 'em out then kicked her out my truck
I'm gon' pick your bitch up
Thuggin' with my C3 niggas [?]
Chillin' in VIP and let that bitch hit the weed, then she get off her man
Northside nigga, roll with that trigger
Of safety looking for jackers
If you a bad bitch then you wanna rape me
If you a broke nigga then you hate me
Niggas they wanna T the R the why thinking I'm [?]
The essence why Imma catch these niggas slippin'
The AR lift 'em up of their feet, they defeat
C3E run the streets
Bitch don't move or you get your ass beat  with the heat
