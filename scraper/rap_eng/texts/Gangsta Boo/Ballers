[Hook(2x)] Ballers we be on some twanky twankies
Playa hataz get found stanky stanky
Trickin fat blunts of dat danky danky
Big diamond rings on ou pinky pinky

[Project Pat]
Jumpin out da trizak
Chewin on a sizack
Sippin on some sizurp
Jus slung a bizag
Name iz Project Pat-a
Moet in my lap-a
Stayin on da grind, cuz da loot gonna stack-a
Watchin for a jack-a
You know I'm a mack-a
Whatcha need dog? Coke, weed, or some crack-a
Ice on my pinky
Smokin on stinky
Caught a sucka slippin
Now I'm on some twenties
Flossin like a playa
Golds keep a twinkle
Eyez fire rized
I'm startin to grow wrinkles
Fall up in da clizub
High off of dizub
Famous in da hood, so these hoes show me lizuv
A dope I'm abizove
So don't be a hate-a
You lame cuz da game, cuz you iz a fake-a
My dopes on da triple
My gats at your temple
I'm hungry for cheese, like hungry hungry hipp-o
