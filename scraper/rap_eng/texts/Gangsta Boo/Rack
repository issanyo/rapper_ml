[Chorus:]
Kill your girl a rack [x2]
Imma shake until my pockets fat
Watch me bring it back [x2]
Kill your girl a rack [x3]
Watch me bring it back
Kill your girl a rack [x2]
Imma shake until my pockets fat
Watch me bring it back

[Verse 1:]
Kill that bitch a rack
Throw that bitch a pack
Make that ass clap
Bitch don’t be wack
Let me see your text
Get that pussy for a treat
If your pussy don’t stank
Your bitch touch your meat
Call me fucking Pope
Let that bitch go
Put the ass out loud
When it hit the fucking floor
I just want to breathe
I just want the head
I wanna fuck both of ya’ll but your girl squeal
I’m a country ass nigga
I fuck with your wife
If that bitch come around I put that hammer in her life
I just meet the pussy west
I ain’t tryna fuck you twice
I might give that bitch away
If that head game nice

[Chorus]

[Verse 2:]
She say fucking 9-5 she throwing in
She got tricks as niggas throwing cash
From the west she try to throw that ass
She walking with razor in her Loui bag
She waving her vehicle to a Jag
She killing me bitches no toll tag
The other Hoe beg or they bill bad
Hey
She went from sexy night to a loff
She shopping that girl on the Ross
She breaking the broke bitches off
Unable to transcribe the line; words are not clear
With a blunder that come from the mouth
These basic ass bitches be hating and talking
Their normal, cause she take it off
Hey, hey
At Least she make em pay a fee
Can’t be letting these broke ass niggas hit for free
Hey, if you wilding but your panties wet
Girl you got the game twisted just like Key Sway
Kill you girl a wreck [x2]
Imma shake until my pockets fat
Watch me bring it back
Kill your girl a wreck [x2]
Imma shake until my pockets fat
Watch me bring it back
Kill your girl a wreck [x3]
Watch me bring it back
Kill you girl a wreck [x2]
Imma shake until my pockets fat
Watch me bring it back
Ooh [x16]
