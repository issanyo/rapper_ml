[Intro: DJ Paul]
Man, these fucking haters out here, man
Fucking voices in my head telling me to cremate these haters
(Cremate, Cre-cre-cremate)
Sitting here, loading up this motherfucking gun (gun)
Hitting this motherfucking dope (dope)
I'm just thinking, man!
I'm just thinking! (thinking)
Fuck these niggas!
Fuck all of 'em (DJ Paul)
Da Mafia 6ix in this motherfucker
Featuring Yelawolf
We came here to kick motherfucking ass
And take motherfucking names
On all you bitch-ass motherfuckers

[Hook: DJ Paul]
Nigga, I go hard
I'll be in the kitchen, nigga whipping
Have these junkies round this motherfucker
Flipping off that motherfucking hard
Breakin' down these dimes, hit rewind, keep that 9
Case these suckers round here want a motherfucking prob'
Nigga, I stay ready for whatever
Cause a nigga like me been had motherfucking hard
Nigga, I stay strapped with that Eagle
Riding in that Regal cause I go motherfucking hard

[Verse 1: DJ Paul]
I go hard with that no regards, they send their regards
All these guns, you can't disregard 'em - we strapped up like gods
We are homies, we need purple hearts, nigga purple hearts
Suffocate the hater til that nigga got a purple heart
Crack, bitch, we got that baseball hard
We constantly trading hollow tip bullets like baseball cards
223, batting, shooting six baseball yards
And when it comes to guns, we number one on the pop charts
Sucker

[Verse 2: Gangsta Boo]
Got my niggas jumping off the porch, and they are trained to go
Headed to kick that busta door, dropping off your ass ho
Yeah, I said it and I meant it, pimping be about her business
Paul told me to kill you hoes, so I'm gonna murk these hoes
Everybody know that Gangsta Boo gon' lead them to the guap
Sipping, tripping, flicking on my haters, and I will not stop
I've been going hard like, "Oh my God, I'll see you at the top"
And bitch when I see you there, I'mma knock you out your fuckin' spot

[Hook: DJ Paul]

[Verse 3: Yelawolf]
I am the king of the six pack
The prince of the whiskey bottle
Get drunk with a fat bitch
Make her feel like a frisky model
Everybody knows rock'n'roll is alive when Iâ€™m in this bitch
Slide up in this mix, I'm do or die when I get that switch
You motherfuckers ain't going hard, you live with that impotence
I'm in that pick-up with the tint, ride on that picket fence
With twenty-sixes, I meant to say Three and Six
Me and these ghetto stars pull up in cars and immediate-
Ly get idiots and G's and media clings to see the city of thieves
Who graffiti the scene
With heathens and fiends who bring heaters in jeans
In Adidas with strings out, you see what I mean, hard!

[Verse 4: Koopsta Knicca]
Seems to me that these are (?)
Gimme that number one spot, here I come bitch
Hit the Billy boulevard get hoes like Vietnam, bitch
Who is she? Click that Desert Eagle DE hondo
Blood on my hands, all on my clothes
Bound dog, Koopsta that motherfucker leavin' folks in them trees
Call me the almighty when we come and bang y'all

[Hook: DJ Paul]

[Verse 5: Lord Infamous]
Increasing my energy Scarecrow, these sissy ass wussies I make em' my petrol
The Infamous juggernaut give 'em more slugs from the Glock and they rot in the gheto
I'm blasting heavy metal but this here ain't no Metallica
I buck' em then embellish ya, the burner in the Challenger
Illuminati in Bugatti, do karate with the shotty
Bloody party, very naughty, infrared dot his nogging
Mysterious disappearances we're experiencing
When killers start appearin' then these niggas just dismember men

[Verse 6: Crunchy Black]
Crunchy said bang, Lord said bang
Koop said bang, any nigga get it, man
Paul had "Sippin," Boo had "Hit Ya"
Getting how I painted this motherfucking picture
Any nigga get it, we ain't playing wit' you hoes
Ten toes down and we spraying on you hoes
Get it how we live, live the way it is
Fuck around nigga, and you get yourself killed

[Hook: DJ Paul]
