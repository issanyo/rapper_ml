[Hook: DJ Paul]
I'm staying crunk I'm plenty drunk I can't be barrin' you bitches
I'm staying crunk I'm plenty drunk I can't be barrin' you bitches
These boys ain't wild I'll fuck them cowards stick them bitches for riches

[Verse 1: DJ Paul]
My nigga silent night, deadly night
That's when I start creepin' like a hitman
Scope my man then I toss the dynamite
Bitches yall ain't got the guns
Bitches yall ain't got the funds
Fuckin' around with Three to Six I'll make you niggas duck and run
Hoes this ain't no game I'm playin'
I'm sayin', I'm fed up with you boys
Crunchy catch that trick back on that-ways he still remeber them punks
Straight ho nigga, flat broke nigga
Make his eyes close I drop you niggas like I drop my hoes

[Verse 2: Gangsta Boo]
I say we marchin' and steppin', plenty weapons we packin'
Why you haters be lackin' always dissin' with rappin'
How you bumpin' our shit then you turn around an you diss?
You wouldn't want to step we been in this shit you rookie bitch
Let me see who it be..shh pysch boy
I ain't sayin your name you know who you are Lil' Boy
In my time I saw faces, people of shades and races
People nail me to crosses like I'm Jesus you Satan

[Hook]
I'm staying crunk I'm plenty drunk I can't be barrin' you bitches
I'm staying crunk I'm plenty drunk I can't be barrin' you bitches
These boys ain't wild I'll fuck them cowards stick them bitches for riches

[Verse 3: Juicy J]
Now I ain't fucked up bout these niggas dissin'
Cause a nigga givin these blessings
See you like a dog you fetching, starin at a fuckin' weapon
Know your momma taught you better, never try to diss a player
Maybe I can kill you now or stall around and kill you later
Probably I should call the boys
Tell them to bring them toys
We gonna bust them bitches and fold them up like aluminium foil
And keep loadin them guns
Takin em one by one
Throwin' up sets and snappin' necks until the job is done

[Verse 4: Lord Infamous]
Take em' on a lyrical holocaust
Infamous just a mafia boss
Nigga walk around with his head blown off
Call me the wicked ass lord of farce
Nigga run up get his ass ripped apart
Infamous cold 'cause he got no heart
Coming through the ho, ain't no motherfuckin bar
Fall to the earth, all cubs get scarred
Hoes be froze in a permanent dose
These bitches blow me outta their clothes
Call me the nigga with the dirty nose
Then I unload a .44 up them foes
Ain't no playin' with you motherfuckin' hoes
Better slow that row, 'cause you hoes don't know
But the Infamous know you
So and So's and Toe and Toe I take yo soul

[Hook]
I'm staying crunk I'm plenty drunk I can't be barrin' you bitches
I'm staying crunk I'm plenty drunk I can't be barrin' you bitches
These boys ain't wild I'll fuck them cowards stick them bitches for riches

[Verse 5: Koopsta Knicca]
Ahh... Stack these verses up on my head see, heard dat?
Ask me if I'm motherfuckin' scared, nigga, hell yeah!
Jumped up out the bed cause ain't no sofa bed in this ya heard?
This sounds, man, no 4 clickas
I ain't going out like no bitch
Ain't no exit out this place like that fog up in my face
Ain't no rollin' like no sissy
Ain't no busta bitch, OK?
Grab that gat cocked and handle like they think that I'm crazed
So hit in their the face like a third grader on acid

[Hook]
