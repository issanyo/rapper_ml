[Intro: Gangsta Boo]
Str-izz-apped all the time
Because some evil shit goes through my head
Bullets to your temple got you bitches dead up in the med
Str-izz-apped all the time
Because some evil shit goes through my head
Bullets to your temple got you bitches dead up in the med

[Hook: Gangsta Boo]
Bloody Glock is cocked and ready pop up on another hoe
Hollow points will have yo bitch-ass
Knockin' on the devils door
Bloody Glock is cocked and ready pop up on another hoe
Hollow points will have yo bitch-ass
Knockin' on the devils door

[Verse 1: Gangsta Boo]
Bloody glocks is cocking ready to pop up on another hoe
What you bitches Doing? Gangsta Boo I already Did a full
Ready to meet your maker, satan ready to take care of you
You can't win against the Devil's daughter baby you gon lose
Str-izz-apped all the time
Because some evil shit goes through my head
Bullets to your temple got you bitches dead up in the med
6 6 6's in the sky, oh my I feel the end is near
Test my Gangsta bitches now I quickly make you disappear
Get up then I lock you in the trunk and if you think I'm playing
Bring your ass to Memphis, Tennessee, them bodies gon be laying
On the floor in projects Hoe, just in case you didn't know
... Benzos.... kick your door(?)

[Chorus]
Bloody Glock is cocked and ready pop up on another hoe
Hollow points will have yo bitch-ass
Knockin' on the devils door
Bloody Glock is cocked and ready pop up on another hoe
Hollow points will have yo bitch-ass
Knockin' on the devils door

[Verse 2: JGRXXN]
Moon full of Blood, devil green, evil in the wind
Phsycopathic lunatic, vycing on a pathogen(?)
Know you sleeping all alone, see you through the window pane
Matchete kind of Haidy, and it's going to be a deadly stain
Pumping pills and talking shit(?) flick it, Fuck it, walk it, lick
Put your ass up in the Clique, know a fucking thing or each
Heard you running like a bitch, Demons in the fucking mist
A 6 Here, a 6 there, 6's in your fucking reife
Evil Style I'm gonna boss, and I'm burning to the floor
Sacrifice your body parts, we'll have you at the Devil's door
Eatin on a bang of Ray this mystic's styles [?]
Pre meditated thoughts as I'm drinking on the Alazay
