[Verse 1: Chris Travis]
Move these fuck niggas out the way, bitch I'm coming through
Drink-laced blunt grape, damn, I'm 'bout to snooze
She wake me up, like good morning your highsness
I'm getting top, higher than a mountain lion
She do whatever I say, like I'm Simon
Bet that nigga be dead on arrivement
I'm a king with my feet on the horizon
And I'm hard to find like a lost license
Put the bottle on the dresser, bitch I need it
I read Proverbs when I'm feeling greedy
And right now, I feel like I ain't eatin'
So I got every fucking right to get greedy
Outta Memphis, a city full of heathens
Shit I'm one too, and I'm still breathing
I'm never in my city, but I'm always repping
Never in my mind, but always second guessing
A young nigga, with a old soul
Bitch I stay hot, that's why I'm so cold
I'm pouring up the Actavis, uh-oh
And my whip beat your ass like a drum-roll

[Hook: Chris Travis]
Money on my mind, money on my mental
Yeah your bitch fine, but your bitch simple
Money on my mind, money on my mental
Yeah your bitch fine, but your bitch simple
Money on my mind, money on my mental
That ain't your bitch, fuck nigga that's a rental
Money on my mind, money on my mental
That ain't your bitch, fuck nigga that's a rental
Money on my mind, money on my mental
Yeah your bitch fine, but your bitch simple
Money on my mind, money on my mental
That ain't your bitch, fuck nigga that's a rental

[Verse 2: Gangsta Boo]
Most bitches don't be understanding techniques
That's what it takes to be a real one in the streets, follow me
The B, the, the, the, U, the, the, the, D
I need, give me shotgun, I smoke the sticky with no seeds
Mane' you know how I be
Usually taking no shit from a bitch
Usually charging and breaking a trick
Been there and done that, as good as it gets
When I'm in Memphis I'm fucking with Chris
Travis, he savage, he one of the homies
Raider Klan bringing the phonk that ain't phony
Connecting the dots, I'm all about money
Your bitch so basic, she so simple, she a bummy ho
I be so pretty, I'm so gangsta', and a nigga know
Yo, I'm getting higher then them other suckers
1990's money, legendary on these lame busta's
I'm 'bout to cop the O two ways, sidekick
Motorola just to show 'em old school real shit
Money, money, money on my mental
It ain't accidental that I popped up like a pimple
