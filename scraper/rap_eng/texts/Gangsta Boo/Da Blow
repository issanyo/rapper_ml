[Lil Jon]
The dro, the 'purp, the 'r'nge (orange), get gush
The bad, no haps, no where to keep it hashed
A joint or two will do you niggas smoke a blunt of this
If you wanna smoke with me, don't bring no bullshit
The blue dumpin', white spinners
The green nickles, that red Superman
Them peach for the five, that white for less
Will have them hoes hotter than a box of stolen checks
The snow, the white in Miami get crunk
When I see 'em in the club, they sniffin' up that stuff
Give you one G of white
Give me two G of white
Give me three G of white
A eight ball for the night
When you wanna get cha lean on it's nothing but that yellow
Or theat 'purp down in Texas, them niggas got whatever
One bottle of that moo, galla-gallon of that Henny
Mix it with that crunk juice will have a nigga spinnin
Like that
