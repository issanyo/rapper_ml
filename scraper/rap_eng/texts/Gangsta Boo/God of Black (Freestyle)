Dear Lola Mitchell
I have some wicked scriptures
That I think the world needs to hear
Let them know I'm real
Let them know I'm here
On the Earth and the end's very near
Believe in the God of Black
Gotta believe in the God of Black
Believe in the God of Black
You better believe in the God of Black

[Verse 1]
Going hard on my mission to get it, I be so with it
Any given chance, baby, got a hustling spirit
Inhaled the weed smoke, forgot all my problems
I got 99 problems, but a bitch ain't a part of it
I'm a goddess, so I be with the gods
If he ain't affiliated with some king shit, I'm breaking his heart
Gotta respect the G code, that's 24-7
Niggas don't, that's why they snitching and telling
Fake jewelry and fake clothes, they want the life
Do anything to get it -- to me, that shit is so trife
They even bite the hand that fed them breakfast
Dishonor at it's best
It's mostly all these bitches who be wishing you your best
Dark nights got me seeing the truth, and it's reckless
Never underestimate the power of deception
Wolves dressed as sheep, they looking for the weak
The devil talking to me as I sleep, and he says
