[Verse 1]
You ain't my kind bitch
You wanted me to do a threesome, you ain't fine bitch
I'm ridin' slabin' Texas and I ain't worried bout' that bullshit that you hoes stressin'
These niggas know what's up, they like the way I be killin' these tracks, these niggas know I'm buck
I'm gonna stay the same, you gonna stay a lame, some shit ain't gon' never change
I know you talk about me, I know you want me broke as fuck, I know
You bitches out me
I'm gon' get mine bitch, don't worry bout Lil Lola, I am doin' fine bitch
I'mma keep it real my nigga, if I don't like you, I don't want you in my face my nigga
I'm on some gangsta shit, if you on't like it, you on't have to fuckin' deal with

[Hook]
I'm gon' hurt one of you bitches
Mane that's why I'm gone stay to myself
Cause these bitches mane, always wanna play
I'm gon' hurt one of you bitches
Mane that's why I'm gone stay to myself
Cause these bitches mane, always wanna play
It's hard not to kill bitches
It's like an everyday job not to kill bitches
It's hard not to kill bitches
It's like an everyday job not to kill bitches
So what's a gangsta do?

[Verse 2]
These candy diamond pill, you same hoes talkin' shit been bumpin' me for years
I'm comin' for my money, if we ain't talkin' 'bout that then we ain't talkin' nothin'
You folks crazy, grab ya ass game, now you suckas tryna play me mane
I swear, it's hard not to kill you, fake ass bitches and fake ass niggas
I'mma stay realer, high in LA, fresh as fuck, smokin' killa
And I got my vodka, with money in my pocket ain't nothin' gonna stop her
Still rockin' with the projects, hair cutted niggas speak the bible, fat priest
Still steppin' on toes, I on't want no friend, I on't fuck with these hoes

[Hook]
I'm gon' hurt one of you bitches
Mane that's what I'm gone say to myself
Cause these bitches mane, always wanna play
I'm gon' hurt one of you bitches
Mane that's what I'm gone say to myself
Cause these bitches mane, always wanna play
It's hard not to kill bitches
It's like an everyday job not to kill bitches
It's hard not to kill bitches
It's like an everyday job not to kill bitches
So what's a gangsta do?
