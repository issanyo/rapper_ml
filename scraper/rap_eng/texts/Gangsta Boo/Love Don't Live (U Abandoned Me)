[Chorus]
You abandoned me
Love don't live here anymore
Just a vacancy
Love don't live here anymore

This is dedicated to all of my ladies in relations
Peep this out

[Verse 1]
I'm a lady who be keepin' it real, you don't care
Take time out, see how I feel
When I be ridin' in the SUV, I'm thinkin' of you
When I be rollin' up a fat one, boy I'm thinkin' of you
You got me goin' like uhh
I'm feelin' the rush, I like to fuck
Let's get buck in the back of the truck, so boy what's up?
It's whatever when it comes down to you
Well it was, until you made it clear that I ain't for you
You just abandoned me, you left me strandedly
Heart broke, constantly
Hearin' love songs on the radio, that remind me of you
They say a gangsta ain't 'posed to cry
But I'm sheddin' tears and I'm a gangsta until I die
I'm tellin' you boy, they say no pain then no gain
Now they call me playa' because you teachin' me all yo game
I say I ain't change, but then again just peep me out
Ay yo, I don't think this shit is gonna work
I'm ready to leave you, get out

[Chorus]
You abandoned me
Love don't live here anymore
Just a vacancy
Love don't live here anymore

[Verse 2]
Just be a man about it, you don't have to lie to me
Playa' leave my house, you can go on away from me
Playa' get yo' car keys, here are yo' clothes too
Man, that's my credit card, hold up that's my bank book
Why you out here cheatin' on me, I'm gettin' my own creepin' on
(Ay girl, why you ain't answering that phone?)
Huh, why because, I was gone
Blew about a whole kilo, pay my own light bill
I don't need you, got a new man for my pleasure, still
Baby, I'm a mack, mista' you ain't heard my real name?
Mrs. Pimpin' Thang, dissing suckas who approach me like
If you wanna play, get in the shower stroke yourself
I ain't the one to be messed with, pimpin' to my death
Get in it, get out, remember how that used to be?
I would get so pleased when you'd come and bring your love to me
But, that's the past now, no more freaky tail nights
No more sexy this, or some X, no more late nights

[Chorus]
You abandoned me
Love don't live here anymore
Just a vacancy
Love don't live here anymore

[Verse 3]
I ain't tryina get caught up in yo games
Personally, I think that you are lame
Whachu' doin' there, now and then when you wanna hit
I ain't givin' you a bit, you'll be just another trick
On my list of busta's, diamond clusters
Rings, old game used to be so not told
With yo' frozen heart, boy you tore my soul apart
My first ex partner, falling heavy from the block
With yo' seven carat wad, give it to me don't you stop
I keep fallin' for you, hypnotized doubt you get my props
But now I'm single, laid back, tight
I ain't tryin' to date a gigolo, men ain't right
He wanna' cut now, he wanna' cut later
He ain't call you then, he ain't call you later
That's how it goes, I'm out the door, holla back
Hit me on my 2-Way when you ready
That's that on that

[Chorus]
You abandoned me
Love don't live here anymore
Just a vacancy
Love don't live here anymore
