Yeah, muhfuckas be talkin' that shit
Talkin' bout why I leave Da Mafia 6ix
Is Boo in Triple Six?
Nigga, I AM Triple Six. Fuck you talkin' bout?
Man, I grew up around the same shit the rest of them niggas grew up around
Fuck you mean?

[Verse]
Popped off in that old school
Leaned back cause I'm so cool
I ain't never ran with a pack of bitches
If you trust them hoes, you a damn fool
I'm smokin' that sack, smokin', I'm smokin' that sack
Mane, and it's hella strong
Free that niggaÂ Guwop, he been locked up too damn long
Them weirdos on the internet, in my comments talkin' that big shit
I don't lose sleep for that nonsense
Y'all playing checkers, I'm playin' chess
You know what's up, go fuck around and getcha nose bust
I ain't talkin' bout from this cocaine
My fist, bitch, be some angel dust

[Hook]
I ain't gotta hang with DJ Paul to be reppin' that triple six. (Mafia!)
I'm a pioneer up in this bitch
You betta recognize who you be fuckin' with. (Mafia!)
With much respect, got the check, got the tech if somebody got a problem with me
I was born in it, I'm a die in it
If you want me then you better try and come and get me. Bitch!
Losin' sleep, that's neva
Always countin' chedda
Nosy motherfuckers wishing that they life was betta
Girl, you do not know me
You ain't on my level
Keep on talkin' shit and I'm gone make you meet the devil

[Verse]
This shit here, this shit ain't for radio, homie. This shit is for hustlas caught in the struggle, surrounded by nothin' but phonies. (You hear me?) [x 2]
Wastin' time [???] it's gone drive you crazy
I'ma have so many smoke mirrors up, it's too hazy
Now you're in a daze, in a maze, I'm enraged. What the fuck you gone do now?
You done pushed a button, now I'm all turned up. And I don't know how to turn down

[Hook]
