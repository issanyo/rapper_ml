[Hook]
Grab my gauge and then erase
Ride up on the street and put some niggas on the front page

[Verse 1: DJ Paul]
Glock nineteen, ninety, nine double-M
Pierce the skin off (?) him
With the Killa Man with the Glock
Better kill a nigga full-clip
Fifteen rounds, better duck, or I'll kill a nigga's shit
Act like some fruits
I'm kicking a solid black carhartt suit
Niggas talk that shit on they tapes
Like they grand daddies and grand mothers are bulletproof
Givin' yo tapes out free because your shit won't sell
Hoe you got bullshit rappers, bullshit DJ's
And some other shit
I'm hearin' hoe shit on your T-a-p-e
Niggas if you think you real step to the Black Haven side
I grab my G-au-g-e, bitch

[Verse 2: Kingpin Skinny Pimp]
(An angel on the left, the devil on right)
I hate what's in the middle (the sky was day and night)
Bustas better duck from the buckin' of the double barrel pump
Plus a trunk for a lemon that'll slip
Hangin' in the projects, all my crooked thugs
Never love a rookie sucker, take a nigga grip when I rip
Through the backdoor, lay it down, I'm a clown
When I'm full of Crown, scary bitch chop it up fast
Watch out they poppin', I'm droppin' the gauge
Like a baby, go googoo, and leave you wet fast
Hangin' at the liquor store, Little Gin full of dope
Strapped with the twelve gauge, gotta let the bitch smoke
In the wind little hoe, bullets in the Afro
Fuckin' with the fright hide keep a nigga strapped up

[Hook]
Grab my gauge and then erase
Ride up on the street and put some niggas on the front page

[Verse 3: Gangsta Boo]
I'm about to creep up on a nigga and make a easy stang
Stang like a bumblebee just like my nigga Skinny mane
Scarecrow my nigga do you think that I can do this shit?
Do you think I can get away so smooth after I hit this bitch?
It can be done so all for one and one for fuckin' all
Gangsta Boo the Devils Daughter guick to make you lemons fall
The sounds of thunder, mh I wonder are you familiar with this?
But if you not you will be soon for fuckin' with Triple Six!

[Verse 4: Koopsta Knicca]
Bang bang until you envision the Christ, mane
Now I'm put in a psycho ward daily
Inside of my dreams I hear little kids scream
Where preachers will witness the hangings
Strange, I'm in the Holy Bible
They can't escape for no soul is in me
Come on, now burn with me
Satan is my fucking witness
The Triple Six shit, it started controlling my blood a year ago
Since I was eject from the streets up in heaven
I'm quickly, I'm blasting you hoes
As told, a true blooded criminal
Leaving two folks on them covers
Think about my mother, I grab the gauge
And commence to like blasting you bustaz

[Verse 5: Lord Infamous]
Me be so indulged with the dope and I'm thinkin' I'm about to faint
The smoke from the Jamaican ganja and I'm steady sippin' on that grapefruit paint, as I drank
I think, I want to just spray niggas while smokin' dank
Then I will go get me some fucking black market artillery like a damn tank so I can sank
A battleship, me motherfuckin' manuscript
Pimp me born equipped to make blood drip with clips of hollow tips, no miss
By Lord, a nigga you cannot afford
To fuck with, I buck with motherfuckin' skull flips
He slips, I swings machetes through his arteries
I don't leave enough of the guts for them to be performin' some fuckin' autopsies
I pop these plastics and burn yo ass like acid
Snatch out ya fucking eyes and put 'em in a jar like Vlasic's
By smokin' on this blunt-ah I'm burnin' bud like lumber
Scarecrow the spirit hunter lives off plenty marijuana
Satanic Triple 6, Satan himself gave me a gun
I'm pumpin' this twenty gauge tryin' to knock out your lungs
I believe in that redruM, bitch
