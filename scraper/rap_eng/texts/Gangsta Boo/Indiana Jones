[Intro]
Hey, they say they want that old Gangsta Boo. Alright, so you want me to go back to that 90's shit, that shit that had everybody locking 'em in a trunk, hella high, snorting cocaine, smoking weed, robbing niggas and shit? That's what y'all want, I'mma give it to ya. I ain't a role model now, I'm just giving y'all what y'all want. You wanna take it back to the 90's, that 90's flow? Alright, ho, here we go

[Verse 1]
Mask to my fucking face, I'm fiending to increase my high
Eyeballs is like red as hell, these bitches better recognize
Rolling a blunt to inhale in my lungs, I'm feeling so so high
Now I'm high, really high; mayne, I think that I can fly
Chilling at the Honeycomb Hideout with my niggas who
Got them choppers and Glocks not locked
And best believe they ass'll shoot
Ratchet bitches all up in my mix with they pettiness
Better get the hell up out my face before a player click
M-E-M-P-H-I-S, rep it like it's nothing left
G-A-N-G-S-T-A -- here to stay, you hoes heard what I said
Creeping through the darkness of the cut with my cousin Nate
Fear no evil, hear no evil -- got my Locs on face, I'm straight
Meet me at the crib about a quarter to eight
Bring my package, don't be late
Catch you slipping, you won't live
Cause niggas gotta pay they bills
Fall up in the jungle, hungry ape, go eat your face
Rip your heart up out your chest
Indiana Jones, ya bitch

I'm Indiana Jones, ya bitch
I'm Indiana Jones, ya bitch
Rip your heart up out your chest
Indiana Jones, ya bitch
I'm Indiana Jones, ya bitch
