[Intro: Bones]
What?
SESH
Boo

[Verse 1: Bones]
Rolling up dope
Pimp named Bones, switchblade in my coat
I don't need hoes, I don't need dough
Bitch, I'm flowing and going the way the rest won't go
I'm the best, y'all know, shit, wilding out
One million blunts, now I'm losing count
Riding 'round, it's just me and Boo
Bucket seats on my old school
Bass in the trunk and it's knocking and thumping
I'm taking them lanes out my Chevrolet
Jumping and snapping, I'm booming and clapping
I'm shaking the earth like everyday
Everyway, bitches say anything to get a pay
Anything to get it good, that's just just like everyday
I'm loc'ing, I'm doping, my girl dead, she hopeless
She overdose, I roll a bone, I'm zoning out while I'm smoking
The razor blade flicking, the teenage demon
The slim young punk, in the alleyway scheming
Young Charles Manson, these bitches think I'm handsome
Ain't showered in a week, still these bitches like cancer
Bitches like anthems but I don't rap for that
Take a beat and make it mine and then I let you have it back
Bones

[Hook: Sample]
When you see me you know
That it's some shit, 'cause I don't come out
I'll be in yo' house, I'm on the couch with the pistol out
When you see me you know
That it's some shit, 'cause I don't come out
I'll be in yo' house, I'm on the couch with the pistol out
When you see me you know
That it's some shit, 'cause I don't come out
I'll be in yo' house, I'm on the couch with the pistol out
When you see me you know
That it's some shit, 'cause I don't come out
I'll be in yo' house, I'm on the couch with the pistol out

[Verse 2: Gangsta Boo]
Smoking weed to calm me down, 'cause I be the crazy lady
Don't got my straight jacket, but I got a full metal jacket if you bitches wanna feel a lot of pain
Come and test my gangsta, I'ma send you hoes to hell
And send yo mama flowers, telling her I wish her well
All black on with the mask like Jason, covering my face, I'm player hating, you snitching bitches couldn't tell
You already know how we do it up in Memphis
The rumors are true, man, I catch you bitches slipping
Call my nig, tell him that, I got ammo, grab my gat
You better not think the shit a game, mane
I ain't no killer but I will do my thang, mane
One, two, three, I'll send them killers at ya, bitch, I'm a fucking OG
And I smoke OG, K-U-S-H all in me
Got me feeling hella mellow, never met a nigga or a bitch that could stand up to my team
Snort that coke up off the table, feeling like I'm Scarface
I'll send pass with all my haters but I quickly erase
Them, they ain't on my radar no more
All of my niggas, they be trained to go
Fucking with pimping, they will cut your throat
Y'all chase the Caddies with 10's on them hoes
Mane, you hoes weak as water
And most of you sucka ass niggas be flodging
1990's gangsta shit, you don't wanna jump into the high seat with the piece again, bitch

When you see me you know
That it's some shit, 'cause I don't come out

When you see me you know
That it's some shit, 'cause I don't come out
I'll be in yo' house, I'm on the couch with the pistol out
When you see me you know
That it's some shit, 'cause I don't come out
I'll be in yo' house, I'm on the couch with the pistol out
When you see me you know
That it's some shit, 'cause I don't come out
I'll be in yo' house, I'm on the couch with the pistol out
