[Hook: DJ Zirk sample]
Grab the gauge and then erase
Grab the gauge I'm in a rage
Ride up on the strip
And put some niggas on the front page

[Verse 1: DJ Paul]
Keep it tucking or use it
Keep my name out yo music
A couple of hundred dollars and fifties
Niggas jump to conclusions
I (?) nigga I split yo wig
Put a nigga house down, three lil pigs
Money on his head, I take that bitch
...
I (?) you niggas to watch out
Ridin' 'round town with the Glock out
I'm ... knock out
Nigga talkin' and knowin' I give a fuck 'bout
These niggas choices
I'm ridin' 'round in Rolls Royces with the cash
Bout to put a move on a nigga
Like I did in the movie "Choices"

[Verse 2: Crunchy Black]
I got 6ix niggas with me and they all got cash
Got 6ix niggas with me and they all wanna blast
Now how many niggas come around my way?
I'm doin' a motherfucker every got damn day
See you can talk this or you can talk that
If you talk that shit
Then I promise I'm stre-e-e-ssed
You can talk this or you can talk that
If you talk that shit
I'mma blow you off the ba-a-a-t

[Verse 3: Gangsta Boo]
Most of y'all niggas yall do too much
Most of y'all bitches don't do enough
I'm gonna roll with the motherfucking captain
Acting like a pirate when I get the kidnappin'
First we roll that fucking bud
Thats the only way that I can show some love
I got a attitude: "Fuck the world!"
Lookin' for a nut like I am a squirrel
Grab the gauge, I'm in a rage
Grab the gauge off in a rage
Ride up on the strip
And put some niggas on the front page
You heard the news Triple 6 is back
Got a whole lot of killin' to do before we (?)

[Verse 4: Koopsta Knicca]
I left North Memphis then I grabbed my Glock
Sent that bitch to hell then I (?)
I didn't need to kill 'em but Paul told me so
Only thing I wanted was me pot of gold
It's just the Koopsta hoe, don't get fucked up
I ... so my name on (?)
Made that trick go to hell
Grab the fucking gauge
Koopsta got 'em scared
Triple 6 engraved in red
