[Chorus]
Tell me how I'm gon' trust you
If you don't trust yourself
I'm just watchin' my steps
These niggas lurkin'
Wanna take my wealth (What?)
Bitch you know I work hard for this shit, stop playin'
I ain't goin' out sad
Lord knows I won't do it
These niggas mad
I don't really give a fuck
Where the hell were you when I was down bad?
These niggas ain't give me one shoulder to lean on
Now I'm on top, I'm just gettin' my dream on
Every day I wake up, gotta throw somethin' clean on
Styrofoam cup, I'm just gettin' my lean on (Sip)
Pop me a perc, baby just for the feelin'
I know it ain't right, it's the way that I'm livin'
Tryna be a role model for all the children
But no I ain't perfect, do you dig what I'm sayin'?

[Verse 1]
No, I ain't perfect, do you dig what I'm sayin'?
I just caught a flight on the way to Japan (Woo)
Family gotta eat, gotta bring home the bands
Still can't believe I had to cut off my mans
I hear 'em all talk, but they don't understand
Feel like all this pressure on me (On me)
Where the hell was you when a nigga didn't eat? (Didn't eat)
Where the hell was you when a nigga couldn't sleep? (Hey)
Grandma gone, I don't know how to feel
Don't wanna cry but I'm lettin' it spill
Life come fast, it just feel surreal
The work don't stop, gotta pay these bills
I can't clock out ho, no-no-no-no
A young nigga tired but I'm still on go mode
Can't let the rap game steal my mojo
Yeah, I'm keepin' it goin'

[Chorus]
Tell me how I'm gon' trust you (Yeah)
If you don't trust yourself (Yourself)
I'm just watchin' my steps
These niggas lurkin' (Lurkin')
Wanna take my wealth (Yeah)
Bitch you know I work hard for this shit, stop playin' (Stop playin')
I ain't goin' out sad (Nah)
Lord knows I won't do it
These niggas mad (What?)
I don't really give a fuck
Where the hell were you when I was down bad? (Let's go)
These niggas ain't give me one shoulder to lean on
Now I'm on top, I'm just gettin' my dream on
Every day I wake up, gotta throw somethin' clean on
Styrofoam cup, I'm just gettin' my lean on (Woo)
Pop me a perc, baby just for the feelin' (Yeah)
I know it ain't right, it's the way that I'm livin' (Yeah)
Tryna be a role model for all the children (I'm tryin')
But no I ain't perfect, do you dig what I'm sayin'?

[Verse 2]
I make real shit for the niggas that appreciate it ('Preciate it)
I know you broke niggas used to hate me
Goin' down like the boy from Houston, baby (Houston, baby)
Steak and shrimp from Houston's, baby (Woo)
I don't even like the bitch, I had to use the lady (Use the lady)
I know your man feelin' useless lately (Ayy)
Like Pac, ridin' round in a new Mercedes (New Mercedes)
I just pray they don't shoot it, baby
Hesitate, step back, then shoot it, baby (Bah bah)
AR and a Ruger baby (Ruger)
You know the pussy stay wet on them cougars, baby (Cougars, baby)
Thank God, hallelujah baby (Woo)
Hella paper, I don't think I need a tutor, baby (Nah)
I'm stuck on you like a tumor, baby
It's too late, should've got the boy sooner, baby (Sooner, baby)
And I don't fuck with the rumors, baby

[Chorus]
How I'm gon' trust you
If you don't trust yourself (Talk to 'em)
I'm just watchin' my steps
These niggas lurkin' (Lurkin')
Wanna take my wealth (What?)
Bitch you know I work hard for this shit, stop playin' (Stop playin')
I ain't goin' out sad (Never, no)
Lord knows I won't do it
These niggas mad (Mad)
I don't really give a fuck
Where the hell were you when I was down bad? (What? What?)
These niggas ain't give me one shoulder to lean on (Nah)
Now I'm on top, I'm just gettin' my dream on
Every day I wake up, gotta throw somethin' clean on
Styrofoam cup, I'm just gettin' my lean on
Pop me a perc, baby just for the feelin' (Yeah)
I know it ain't right, it's the way that I'm livin' (Yeah)
Tryna be a role model for all the children (Yeah)
But no I ain't perfect, do you dig what I'm sayin'? (Haha)

[Outro]
Dig what I'm sayin'?
(No, I ain't perfect, do you dig what I'm sayin'?)
(Dig what I'm sayin'?)
But no, I ain't perfect, do you dig what I'm sayin'?
(Yeah yeah yeah yeah)
Dig what I'm sayin'?
(No, I ain't perfect, do you dig what I'm sayin'?)
(No, I ain't perfect, do you dig what I'm sayin'?)
No, I ain't perfect, do you dig what I'm sayin'? (Yeah yeah)
Oh oh oh oh (Yeah, touchdown)
Oh oh oh oh
Yeah, talk to 'em, talk to 'em, let's get it
Oh oh oh oh (Yeah, touchdown)
Oh oh oh oh
