[Chorus]
I can't be your man (Let's go)
And I know you want more than that
I can't be your man
And I know you want more than that (I know, I, I know)
I can't be your man
And I know you want more than that
I can tell you want to stay
It's best we go our separate ways
I can't be your man (Your man)
And I know you want more than that (Know you want more)
I can't be your man (Your man)
And I know you want more than that (Ayy)
I can't be your man (Your man)
And I know you want more than that (Know you want)
I can tell you want to stay (I know)
It's best we go our separate ways (Haha)

[Verse 1]
Go our separate ways (Let's go), it's okay
I might let you lay, but you can't stay (Bye)
Don't know what to say
Girl you know we just fuckin'
So please stop actin' like it's more than that
Fuck up out my face (Fuck up out my face), I can't chase (Nah)
Know I got a main (Okay?), she don't play (She don't)
All that fun we had (Yeah), is erased
Just like your number
So when you call, I ain't callin' back

[Chorus]
I can't be your man
And I know you want more than that (Know you want more)
I can't be your man
And I know you want more than that
I can't be your man
And I know you want more than that
I can tell you want to stay
It's best we go our separate ways
I can't be your man (Your man)
And I know you want more than that (Know you want more)
I can't be your man (Your man)
And I know you want more than that (Ayy)
I can't be your man (Your man)
And I know you want more than that (Know you want)
I can tell you want to stay (I know)
It's best we go our separate ways (Haha)

[Verse 2]
I can't be your man, lil' mama
I know this wasn't your plan, lil' mama
I see you tryna do what you can, lil' mama
Please don't act like a fan, lil' mama
Please stop where you began, lil' mama
I know you a freak, I can brand lil' mama
And I know my bitch can't stand lil' mama
Just fall back, we don't need that drama
It ain't gotta be like that but it be like that
Takin' my shirts but I need that back (Yeah)
Tell me, would you fuck if a nigga didn't rap?
Feelin' like Chainz, all the B's in the trap
Shawty just want double C's in her lap (Ayy)
I just want to put double C's in her gap (In her gap)
In her box (In her box), tryna pop (Tryna pop)
She a thot (She a thot), bop bop

[Chorus]
I can't be your man
And I know you want more than that (Know you want more)
I can't be your man
And I know you want more than that
I can't be your man
And I know you want more than that
I can tell you want to stay
It's best we go our separate ways
I can't be your man (Your man)
And I know you want more than that (Know you want more)
I can't be your man (Your man)
And I know you want more than that (Ayy)
I can't be your man (Your man)
And I know you want more than that (Know you want)
I can tell you want to stay (I know)
It's best we go our separate ways

[Outro]
Yeah
Know you want more
I can tell you want to stay
It's best we go our separate ways
