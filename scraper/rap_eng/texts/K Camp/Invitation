[Intro: K Camp]
Take another of sip of this and think about it

[Chorus]
Fuck that bullshit, I'm finna pull up on you
Fuck that bullshit, I'm finna pull up on you
Fuck that bullshit, I'm finna pull up on you
Fuck that bullshit, baby pull up on ya
Girl I'm waiting on ya
Fuck that bullshit, pull up on ya
Fuck that bullshit, I'm finna pull up on you
Fuck that bullshit, I'm finna pull up on you
Fuck that bullshit, that bull shit

[Verse 1]
Fuck that bullshit, I'm finna pull up on you
You know I'm waiting on you, you know I'm waiting on you
Shit we can chill and watch some Netflix
And if you got the munchies get some Chex Mix
Shawty, shawty got my mind twisted up
I'ma take my time dealing with us
I don't wanna rush into anything
But you can tell I'm fucking with your campaign
You can tell I'm fucking with your innocence
Shawty fine as hell and intelligent
'Cause you know I'm the shit, you the shit too
I promise every time, I will pick you
I know you got a man that you still dealing with
But understand, baby, he ain't fucking with this shit
He ain't got my presence, he ain't got my stelo
I'm just being honest, that nigga a zero
I'm just being honest, you need me in your life
We don't need no ring, but I need me a wife
Someone to come home to and beat it at night
I got what you need, I don't need no advice

[Chorus]
Fuck that bullshit, I'm finna pull up on you
Fuck that bullshit, I'm finna pull up on you
Fuck that bullshit, I'm finna pull up on you
Fuck that bullshit, baby pull up on ya
Girl I'm waiting on ya
Fuck that bullshit, pull up on ya
Fuck that bullshit, I'm finna pull up on you
Fuck that bullshit, I'm finna pull up on you
Fuck that bullshit, that bull shit

[Verse 2: Asiahn]
Fuck that bullshit and come and pull up on me
You need to break me off, you the one and only
You know I got my own, I confide in you
Just aways keep it real and always stay true
You see we both put in that work but when I be alone
I only think of you and when you coming home
And fuck them other niggas 'cause they ain't you
I only make time for the one and baby that's true
So let me lace you
Let me lace you
If you was this for ever baby fall through
If you gon' hold it down, you can find out
What fucking with a real one is all about

[Chorus]
Fuck that bullshit, I'm finna pull up on you
Fuck that bullshit, I'm finna pull up on you
Fuck that bullshit, I'm finna pull up on you
Fuck that bullshit, baby pull up on ya
Girl I'm waiting on ya
Fuck that bullshit, pull up on ya
Fuck that bullshit, I'm finna pull up on you
Fuck that bullshit, I'm finna pull up on you
Fuck that bullshit, that bull shit

[Bridge: K Camp]
Pull up, pull up, pull up, pull up
Pull up, pull up, pull up, pull up
Pull up, pull up, pull up, pull up
Pull up, pull up, pull up, pull up
Pull up, pull up, pull up, pull up
Pull up, pull up, pull up, pull up
Pull up, pull up, pull up, pull up
Pull up, pull up, pull up, pull up

[Outro]

On me
Pull up on me shawty
On me
Pull up on me
On me
Pull up on me
On me
