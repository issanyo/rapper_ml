[Hook:]
These niggas fuckin' the same hoes
Rather just count me a bankroll, rather just count me a bankroll, rather just count me a bankroll
These niggas be fuckin' the same hoes
Rather just count me a bankroll, rather just count me a bankroll, rather just count me a bankroll
These niggas be fuckin' the same hoes
Rather just count me bankroll, rather just count me a bankroll, rather just count me bankroll
These niggas be fuckin' the same hoes
Rather just count me bankroll, rather just count me a bankroll, rather just count me bankroll

[Verse 1: K Camp]
These niggas be fuckin' the same hoes, wearin' the same clothes
I rather just count me a bankroll, rather just count me a bank roll
I put my lil' bitch in a Range Rover, shot a lil' text and she came over
I'ma go hard 'til the fame over, but yet they don't know that it's game over
Roll up the weed 'til I flow, filling my cup 'til it spill
I put the squad on my back, making the plays on the field
These niggas know what it is, chase that lil' bitch if you wanna, chase that lil' bitch if you wanna, she is a real primadonna

These niggas be fuckin' the same hoes
Rather just count me bankroll, rather just count me a bankroll, rather just count me bankroll

[Verse 2: True Story Gee]
I gotta get me a bankroll, probably gon' fuck on his main hoe
I heard she shopping at Rainbow, I do not got a lil' thang for her
Really not feelin' this bitch, why is she all in the whip[?], why is she touchin' the Swishers, she probably done fucked on my niggas
You know I'm all about benjamins, I'm trynna get me a bankroll
Plus I done opened[?] my standards, I do not fuck with no lame hoes
And I be sipping on mud, we got this shit out the mud
And I just seen yo' lil hoe, I did not give her no love, yeaah
