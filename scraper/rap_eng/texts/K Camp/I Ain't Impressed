[Intro]
Ain't impressed with these niggas, ain't impressed
I ain't impressed with these niggas, ain't impressed

[Chorus]
Ain't impressed
I ain't impressed with these niggas
Ain't impressed with these bitches
Ain't impressed with these niggas
Ain't impressed (Ain't impressed)
I ain't impressed with these niggas
Ain't impressed with these bitches
Ain't impressed with these niggas
Ain't impressed (Ain't impressed)
If he ride then that's my nigga
Need these drugs, I need this liquor
That's the only thing I know that ease the stress (Ease the stress)
I ain't impressed with these niggas
Ain't impressed with these bitches
We the only thing that matter, fuck the rest

[Verse 1]
All I wanted was some jewelry on my neck (Let's go)
God's gift, got it tatted on my flesh (On my flesh)
I came out fightin', couldn't let 'em take my check (Take my check)
Mama told me keep my head, boy you blessed
I gotta win on them niggas, ain't kin with them niggas
They mad 'cause my check gettin' bigger
True to myself, bitch I feel like I'm Tiller
Backwood is loaded, it's filled with the killer
Uh, drip in that Gucci chinchilla ('Chilla)
Eat on that lil' ho for dinner
I need your blessings, I know I'm a sinner
I confess (What's up?)

[Chorus]
I ain't impressed with these niggas
Ain't impressed with these bitches (No)
Ain't impressed with these niggas
Ain't impressed (Ain't impressed)
I ain't impressed with these niggas
Ain't impressed with these bitches
Ain't impressed with these niggas
Ain't impressed (Ain't impressed)
If he ride then that's my nigga
Need these drugs, I need this liquor
That's the only thing I know that ease the stress (Ease the stress)
I ain't impressed with these niggas (Woo)
Ain't impressed with these bitches
We the only thing that matter, fuck the rest

[Verse 2]
They tried to hold me down way too long
Please hold on, Al Capone
Tell your bitch this her song
Bought some jewels, bought some chrome
Pow pow pow, boy go home
In that storm on my own
You turned your back, you was wrong
Fendi socks and VLONE
Hear that pain, in my tone (Woo, woo)
It's unknown, been the GOAT all along
Keep them racks in my home
Bought my bitch some stones (Stones)
You rappers is some clones
You ain't impressed, you not alone (Yeah)

[Chorus]
Ain't impressed
I ain't impressed with these niggas
Ain't impressed with these bitches (Hey)
Ain't impressed with these niggas
Ain't impressed (I ain't impressed, yeah)
I ain't impressed with these niggas
Ain't impressed with these bitches
Ain't impressed with these niggas
Ain't impressed (Let's go)
If you ride then you my nigga
Need these drugs, I need this liquor
That's the only thing I know that ease the stress
I ain't impressed with these niggas
I ain't impressed with these bitches
We the only thing that matter, fuck the rest

[Outro]
Fuck the rest, fuck the rest, fuck the rest
Fuck the rest, fuck the rest, fuck the rest
Fuck the rest, fuck the rest, fuck the rest
Fuck the rest, fuck the rest, fuck the rest
Yeah
