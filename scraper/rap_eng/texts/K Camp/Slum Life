[Intro]
I know I'm that nigga what up
You know I'm that nigga what up
Feel like I went right you went left
(what up)
Swear I been at war with myself
(chea chea)
I just bought a new house
Cheese eggs straight from your spouse
Imma show her what her [?] bout

Metro Boomin want some more nigga

[Verse 1]
50K in a rubberband, you can tell that I changed tho (changed tho)
I might buy my bitch a new Lamb
(Skert)
That's if the bitch don't change up
Everyday i see a nigga thuggin' in my comments
Bitch I'm Gary Payton when he played for the Sonics
I will steal yo bitch and put some dick up off her in stomach
You rappers still hatin' on a God how ironic
Duck nigga, Yous a duck nigga
I feel like you got a problem so wassup witcha
Might smoke out yo bitch
And after that just go have lunch with her
Send her in the Uber after that you can have fun wit her (Uber Everywhere)
Like, shawty I'm too busy you can meet me at the telly
On that slum shit fuck you in some new Giuseppe's
Bitch I feel like Pac, so just call me Makaveli
(ohhhh)
And I don't care if you accept

[Hook]
Welcome to that slum life
Slum life
Slum life
I said welcome to that slum life, yahhh

[Bridge]
Take it to the head now
Take it to the head
Might trade in that Porsche and cop that brand new Ghost instead, hoppin calabashses wit a bitch all in my dreads
She think that I love her, sorry that you been misled

[Outro: K Camp]
Welcome to that slum life
(Hey)
You know I'm that nigga what up
(what up)
I know I'm that nigga what up
(what up)
Feel like I went right you went left, went left
(Chea, Chea)

Slow... I call this practice my nigga
Shoutout The Weeknd, fuck wit me
