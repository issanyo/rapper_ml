[Hook]
Got a lil bitch on the way, meet me at the Holiday
I ain't want to tell her where I stay never show these bitches where you lay
Got a lil bitch on the way, meet me at the Holiday
I ain't want to tell her where I stay never show these bitches where you lay
Damn I got too many hoes, damn I got on too much gold
I charge a brick for a show (brick) now follow the yellow brick road
These bitches clicking they heels, how are you paying your bills?
Pull out them dick sucking skills, how you know I'm worth a mill
How you know I'm worth a mill
How you know I'm worth a mill
How you know I'm worth a mill
How you know I'm worth a mill

[Verse 1]
Tell a lil bitch I done blowed up
Lamborghini smashing with the doors up
Ain't a bitch out here that don't know us
Heard you got the rap game sewed up
You can tell that I'm getting to the fetti
Throw it up just like confetti
All my younger bitches petty
Put my bitch inside the Lexus
I be shitting on my exes
Get these bitches out my section
Picking new ones like elections
Slum all my niggas wildin'
Ain't no tellin' what I do ridin'
Round the city with two bitches in my coupe
Bring them to the 'tel then we fuck 'em in a group
You ain't gettin' money, ain't no way you in the loop
You ain't gettin' money, ain't no way you on my staff
I got my niggas on my side that will bust ya head on my behalf
Roll 'em back to back, got ya bitch on my shaft
What she do behind closed doors
You don't know the half, ho

[Verse 2]
I can make the money do a lot of things
I can make the money do a black flip
He ain't gettin' money, now he actin' strange
White man world makin' black chips
These bitches talkin' like they on somethin'
Beggin' ass niggas always want somethin'
Nigga always talkin' 'bout foreign whips
Pussy ass nigga, you don't own nothin'
I can make your whole rent, one feature
Nigga pay attention you just met the teacher
I can sell salt to a slug, nigga
Pretty much connected with the drug dealers
Drug dealers
