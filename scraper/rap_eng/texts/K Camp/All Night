I, I don't really know about you
But I came to party all night
Welcome to my party
Dranking at my party
It's a perfect party
I, I don't really know about you
But I came to party all night
Welcome to my party
Smoking at my party
It's a perfect party

[Verse 1]
Fall off in the club they like damn who is he
Baby come and shot with yo wat (ooh wee) ?
We came to party, baby girl loosen up
We in the building we 'bout to (turn up)
Im hot, I'm burning up ?
And when i hit the cup, i take off just like a jet
?
But im choosing her so you know that it's a go
Come on girl lets go
Where you wanna go
Green lght, green light go
You know that i go
Off swagging like these ?
Let me see you turn up

And I tell 'em

[Verse 2- Jt A-1]
Bud out my mind but here's the situation
Say she wanna go but you didn't get no invitation
In no hesitation
I like what going on
If he can't go and I can't go, that mean there something wrong
? I can cry if I want to
Hello to my boo hoo
Do what she is suppose to
And we understand each other there's no need to worry
Trust me if you're insecure, Ill be there in a hurry
I can give directions, baby girl, if you feelin' loss
It's a crazier appetite, my outfit compliments the sauce (sauce)
Aye what party hot now I suggest you pull the foul
And they goin' look at me like I ain't been out in awhile

[Hook-K Camp]
I, I don't really know about you
But I came to party all night
Welcome to my party

I, I don't really know about you
But I came to party all night
Welcome to my party
Smoking at my party
It's a perfect party
