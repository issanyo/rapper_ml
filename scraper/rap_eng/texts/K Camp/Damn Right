I can see the money coming with my eyes close (Damn Right)
When it comes to that grind nigga anythang goes (I know u feel me Damn Right)
I'ma always get that dough (Damn Right)
I'm trying get it back you know (Damn Right)
I'm worth a Mil on the low (Damn Right)

[Verse 1]
Ok it started with a nigga that just had them hoop dreams
Then I fell in love with music I was only 13
Grab the mic started flowing plenty doubted I kept going
Plenty years in that booth perfecting craft I had to show em
While y'all sleeping I was working all night getting it in
Mama looking at me crazy cuz I failed a class again
Couldn't work a 9 to 5 cuz that shit ain't for me
In my head had vision one day i'll be on TV
Putting on for side but I knew I had to grind
It ain't happen overnight man this shit took sometime
Stayed focus had a dream then I hit them billboards
And I'm only getting started I gotta plan nigga what's yours

[Verse 2]
I got the world in my hands I control the show
See that money I done seen that shit come and go
With these bitches they gone love yo ass until u broke
That's why the only thang she get from me is that good stroke
Love will get you killed I'm cold inside just like a freezer
I outwork these niggas I earn my spot just like a cheetah and
Yo ho gone let me slide through don't need no visa
First they hated then I turned they asses to believers
Damn in due time(in due time) i'll be fine(I'm good)
Tell'em ketchup(Ketchup lil nigga) I ain't talking Heinz(Oh no)
Them hating niggas we don't see those
I get high just to balance lows I'm in control so u know
