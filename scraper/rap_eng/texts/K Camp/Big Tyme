[Hook: K Camp]
Bitch I'm big time and my bitch fine
I'm gon' get mine, let my wrist shine
Bitch I'm big time and my bitch fine
I'm gon' get mine, let my wrist shine
Let my wrist shine, let my wrist shine
Let my wrist shine, bitch I'm big time
Bitch I'm big time and my bitch fine
Let my wrist shine, let my wrist shine

[Verse 1: K Camp]
Bitch I'm big time and my bitch fine
Threw that back though
We don't wait in line
That's an Audemar
Watch that bitch shine
Coulda bought a car
But I bought some diamonds
Thought you'd see me shining
Feel like Frankie Lymon
I know he ain't got it
I can tell he lying
I can tell he trying
Bitch you know I'm up
If you want a feature, hit my booking up

[Hook: K Camp]
Bitch I'm big time and my bitch fine

Bitch I'm big time and my bitch fine
I'm gon' get mine, let my wrist shine
Let my wrist shine, let my wrist shine
Let my wrist shine, bitch I'm big time
Bitch I'm big time and my bitch fine
Let my wrist shine, let my wrist shine

[Verse 2: Dae Dae]
Let the kid shine
Let my bitch shine
I ain't got time to play
I got spots to lay
Hot Boy, Hot Boy
Young Weezy, AP, Young Juvie
TIP on that OG Kush
Yeah the King Louie, King Louie
This is an AP
This is a Rollie
This is a middle finger for the fuck niggas I hear (?)
This is set life, I got freak women presidential
Evidently they gon' hate anyway, I got Camp with me
