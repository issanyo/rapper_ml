[Verse 1: K CAMP]
4 whips in that driveway
Push 100 on the highway, highway
Got a Porsche and a i8, skrt
From the jump I did it my way, my way
Top down like I’m supposed to, supposed to
I swear your man so last week, last week
I can’t remember my last freak, yea
Smokin louis so I’m past geeked, yeah
Puttin on that’s for the town
Swear these niggas tried to lock me down, lock me down
Swear these niggas tried to stop it now
Took a break now I’m back around, back around
Ridin low in that Cadillac
Gotta know I got Bobby with me, Bobby with me
All the squad in the lobby with me
Fast life Kawasaki livin, fff
You be flexin for these bitches when you broke, don’t do that
Pushin foreigns when you know you can’t afford it, don’t do that
On the gram flexin like you so important don’t do that
I know who I am and my bitches they all gorgeous you know that

Don't do that, don't do that

[Verse 2: Derez Deshon]
Every loss I learned a lesson
Every cross I bought a blessing
Jesus pieces on my necklace
My baby mama callin stressing
Went from arguing on the phone to texting
Bought a beamer bottom to my ride or die
But you going the wrong direction, where r u goin?
Changing lanes you better U-turn, skrt
You said don’t let the fame get to my head
Look how you turned out
Say I ain’t the same but ain’t nothing change except that you burned out
Left me in the cold
How could you do that you knew not to do that, we came from the floor
All we had was each other we was broke
Ate off the same plate the same bowl
Ate off the same spoon the same fork
Gotta lil change of niggas who changed on me
I came from nothing man they hatin on me
Don’t do that
Man when you see me nigga don’t do that
Holy grail like a secret only hoes do that
Been a hundred since the one and they all knew that
