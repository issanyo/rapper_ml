[Pre-Hook: Tim Saunders]
I'm with D.E.A.D. Entertainment, that's D-E-A-D
We might drop them bars, that AT&T
When it comes to rap, I'm the fucking king
If you like that ballin', show you what that ballin' be

[Hook: Tim Saunders]
Money baby
Money baby, money baby
Money baby
Money baby, money baby, yeah
Money baby
Money baby, money baby, yeah
That's that shit I like, yeah
Woah, woah

[Verse 1: Tim Saunders]
I was worried they wouldn't be into me
I thought my fear would be the end of me
But then I had an epiphany
And I realized these rappers don't mean shit to me
They don't mean shit to me, man
Might fuck around run the industry fam
I'm popping off like Yosemite Sam
They standing there just like "Timothy, damn!
I ain't now you had bars forreal
Fuck them other niggas, you could kill em' all forreal"
I don't be in the studio long
I get everything on that first take
On that first take
Like Skip Bayless and Stephen A
Oh oh oh
I'm on my Drake shit
These other rappers on fake shit
I'm the best rapper in Cambridge
When I make a remix, I'mma make it hot
Flow out the oven like Drake & Josh
Man I'm sick of street rap, I'm tired of street rap
I'm over street rap, Jake and Josh
I bring the heat like Wade and Bosh
But like a rocket, I'm taking off, and I'm fly
My bars hot just like all of the Haitians
Speaking of Haiti, might go on vacation
Beat the beat up, like I play for the Ravens
And your girl receiving like she Derrick Mason
Write my lyrics in pen, so there is no erasing
My impact, my syntax is fucking amazing
And I ain't got to be making enemies
Cause you know I'm too busy making

[Hook: Tim Saunders]
Money baby
Money baby, money baby
Money baby
Money baby, money baby
Money baby
Money baby, money baby, yeah
That's that shit I like, yeah
Woah, woah

[Verse 2: J. Maltez]
Sitting on top of this cloud nine
Round five with these proud giants
Knocking down to the ground, why?
Cause it's pound time when these sounds flying
And yall still trying
While I spit rhymes with elegance, see
All my delegates, we hold the presidency
Yall sip delicate teas, we are delicacy
You irrelevant, B, hell if I'm jealous
Of a negligent sleaze, tell if agreed
Now I'm on top of the world we are relatives? Please
Man, get the hell off my d
And suck it, no Popsicle
I'm responsible for this apocalypse
Cause I am ending you niggas like proximal
Distance yourself from the optimal, I go Guantanamo
Imprison these bitches, I lock the door
Follow close, if you don't how to go
Cause my future is filled with the commas and cheese
You will drop to your knees when I'm knocking you over like dominoes
I can go all day
You can't come stop the show, cause that's what has gotten my dollar flow
Say I got money that's out the door
You got to know go it's not a joke
Its the season for sequels, you seeking the freedom
My sentences separate sensitive
Showing no sympathy, I'm skillfully
Synthesizing a synchronous sole symphony
I don't like you as is, no simile
So simply, I signal the similar style
So if you simple don't try sit with me
Just try to wonder what we done to come away with all this motherfucking money baby

[Hook: Tim Saunders & J. Maltez]
Money baby
Money baby, money baby
Money baby
Money baby, money baby, yeah
Money baby
Money baby, money baby, yeah
That's that shit I like, yeah
Woah, woah
