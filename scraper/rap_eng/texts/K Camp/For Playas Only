I can't take you serious
I can't take you serious
I can't take you serious

Shawty play around too much (Shawty play around too)
Shawty fuck around too much (Shawty fuck around too)
I swear shawty talk too much (Too much)
And I swear I see you out too much (Yeah, yeah)

[Hook]
Girl stop that playing (Playing)
Sit your ass down, yeah
Get you some bread (Bread)
Fuck with the guy, one time
Girl use your head (Head)
You got potential and you dumb fine

[Verse 1]
Why you always in the club
Chasin' after all them bottles
Why you always on the gram
Pretending that you a model
She adicted to the likes, yea
She adicted to the life, yea
Different section every night, yea
Snapchat till it's right, yea
Just wanna know where the money at
She gon' follow where the money at
Runnin' threw it like a running back
Waste training where your stomach at
Don't let the beauty go to waste
Henny straight don't need a chase
She told a nigga she needs space
And I'ma tryna fuck her face
Shawty change your ways up
You won't never ever play us
This is the song for the playas
She so gone you can't save her

[Pre-Hook]

And I swear I see you out too much (Yeah, yeah)

One of my woes done had you
Why you tryna act so curious

Never gon' keep'em get treated like
Hit a lot, I can I can barely remember
Hit a lot, I can barely remember
She want a nigga that put a ring on it
I wanna look bitch you come sing on it
I heard you said setting them lil niggas up
I bought a forty and put a beam on it
