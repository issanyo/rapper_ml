[Chorus: Dice SoHo]
Two bad bitches and they ain't mine
Two more bitches blowin up my line
And they both gettin naked on FaceTime
FaceTime (oou) FaceTime
Two bad bitches and they ain't mine
Two more bitches blowin up my line
And they both gettin naked on FaceTime
FaceTime (oou) FaceTime

(Verse 1) (Dice Soho):
Shawty give me face
Shawty give me FaceTime
Cuz she know that ima star like the bape sign
Girl I heard that pussy bomb thru the grape vine
Let me get behind it I ain't tryna waste time
She said boy what you gonna do with it?
Ima about to act a fool with it
Ima dive like a pool in it
I hop in the freezer, get salad like ceaser
She eat me up like some pizza
I just kick back while i'm smoking on reefer
I ain't no teacher but bitch I could teach ya
She gon listen to me like ima preacher
Lamborghini lookin like it's a creature
She give me head while I ride on the (??)
Shawty a keeper, butterfly doors
I just pop hoes, she my ride or die
We duckin 5-0, we be gettin faded till or eyes close
Muddy cup so I gotta drive slow

[Chorus: Dice SoHo]
Two bad bitches and they ain't mine
Two more bitches blowin up my line
And they both gettin naked on FaceTime
FaceTime (oou) FaceTime
Two bad bitches and they ain't mine
Two more bitches blowin up my line
And they both gettin naked on FaceTime
FaceTime (oou) FaceTime

(Verse 2) (K Camp)
Ion like to text too much
But if that pussy good, I might take ya there
I gotta check on her
She say we sext too much (what?)
No such thing (no such thing)
Shawty take a look at my ring
Gotta treat you way more than a fling
Hey, roll that dice
Go head gamble with ya life
I ain't puttin up no fight
Shawty got pussy like ice
Yeah that cold hope that pussy don't bite
Shawty just make my night, don't think twice
Fuck around and bought that flight
FaceTime me when you land
Girl stop playin you know i'm pullin up on sight
(Skrt Skrt, Skrt Skrt)
Just don't get on my nerves, might let you whip my foreign
But don't scratch my rims on the curb
(woah woah, woah woah)
Shawty I can change ya life
Make plays with my young nigga dice
I swear this shit ain't nice

[Chorus: Dice SoHo]
Two bad bitches and they ain't mine
Two more bitches blowin up my line
And they both gettin naked on FaceTime
FaceTime (oou) FaceTime
Two bad bitches and they ain't mine
Two more bitches blowin up my line
And they both gettin naked on FaceTime
FaceTime (oou) FaceTime
