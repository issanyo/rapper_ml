[Hook: K Camp]
Fuck with a nigga, why wait?
I ain't tryna take you on a date
Move that lame nigga out the way
If he ain't tryna get her then I'm straight
I'll throw the money in your face
I'll put your bitch in her place
Slap her on the ass like ooh, ooh
Shawty I ain't ever sang, true, true
It don't take much to get loose
I can bring the freak out of you
You know I'm tryna win, not lose
She done been around the whole crew
Shawty just doin' what she do
Fuckin' with the squad like ooh, ooh

[Verse 1: K Camp]
Smokin' on the OG gas
I'ma need a little more bags
I'ma need a little more cash
Stars on me like a flag
I'm drinkin' that shit out the flask
Real pimp nigga, my bad
Smokin' that precious like ooh, ooh
Shawty said that that ass real
Pop a couple pills in the Hills
Baby just tell me how it feel
Fuck around, make a short film
Shawty act like the old Kim
I'll treat you like one of them
All in the pussy like ooh, ooh
Ask all my bitches
Ask all my bitches, you know that shit
Ask all my bitches
Ask all my bitches, you know that shit too
Ask all my bitches
Ask all my bitches, you know that shit
Ooh, ooh

[Verse 2: Tink]
Tink and Camp, yeah
Shawty make me buss like a semi
Feel it in my guts when he's in me, just my type
Might as well call it and I got it
Get it one time and I swear that shit changed my life
Ooh you're somethin' special, boy
And it feels like ooh, ooh
Ooh, yeah, let's start with confessions
What's your first impression of me? Something crazy?
I mean I was normal until we got formal
And now I'm all crazy
Have you ever tried ecstasy
When you put your love on me?
Kinda feels like ooh, ooh
Oh and you can
Ask all my ladies, ask all my ladies
You're the only thing I think about, there's no concentrating
Ask all my ladies, you can ask all my ladies
It's you, Tink and Camp, yeah
