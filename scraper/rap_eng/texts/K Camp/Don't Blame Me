[Hook]
Don't blame me, just blame yo' bitch (x4)
I can't help she want a nigga (x2)
So don't blame me, just blame yo' bitch
Don't blame me, just blame yo' bitch (x3)
I can't help she want a nigga (x2)

[Verse 1]
Don't blame me, just blame yo' bitch
Yeah, she stuck, Lilo and Stitch
I'm a dog, call up Mike Vick
I blame the toilet for this shit
I'm in her box just like some Ritz
Put it on her chest just like some Vick's
You can't fuck around with me
Yo' bread too small like crystal chicks
Yo' bitch real thick like a bowl of grits
I hit that once and now I'm pissed
Cause I need to touch that twice
That pussy tight like a muhfuckin' fist
She tryna bite like a muhfuckin' pit
Slapped her on the head, said stop that shit
I don't need no teeth on me
But yo' ho like a leech on me, she stuck

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
She on her job, she cannot stop
You was in the picture but you got cropped
I heard yo' girl was a one-stop shop
Like a BB gun, that bitch gon' pop
A lil' bit of money, she gon' shake like locks
Bitch, I ain't got time, yeah, I broke my clock
You say you don't suck no dick, you lyin'
That ho too funny, call up Chris Rock
I heard all eyes on me like Pac
Like wires in the rain, I'll leave that bitch shocked
Just say the word, it's going down like Joc
Black steel in my jeans, no, it ain't no Glock
A young nigga slick, move around like a fox
These hoes coming out of nowhere, chickenpox
I can't help yo' girl looked twice
But check this out, this some advice

[Hook]
