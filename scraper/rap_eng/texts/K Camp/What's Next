[Pre-Chorus: GENIUS & K Camp]
I just killed a city, what's next? (Yeah)
Took off on my ex, what's next? (Gone)
House up in the hill, what's next? (What's next?)
I been chasin' mils, what's next? (What's next?)

[Chorus: K Camp]
I just copped a coupe, what's next? (What's next?)
Collins with no roof, what's next? (What's next?)
He ain't got no juice, what's next? (What's next?)

Oh (Oh), oh (Oh), oh (Oh), oh (Oh)
I just copped a coupe, what's next? (Skrrt)
Collins with no roof, what's next?

[Verse 1: K Camp]

[Verse 2: Nessly]
Niggas take off they jewelry, look like an alien with that green skin
Friday I fuck an Australian, Saturday I fuck a bitch out in England
Niggas be thinkin' we on the same page and I think that they lame, we not linkin'
She pull up and give me that pussy, I put her in the living room with a blanket, yeah
VVS, I want my trinket
Ayy, Brita filter 'round my motherfuckin' wrist
And I got your girlfriend want to drink it
All these blue hundreds take way too much room up
I gotta burn 'em like an incense
Only kings in my lineage
With these tings in my condominium
Fake diamonds got a nigga neck changin' colors like Aunt Vivian
Yeah, ballin' like Michael
Sippin' on cups of that Space Jam
Lit with about fifty bitches from Instagram, like an alien invasion
Look like a Fashion Nova casting
They used to want to go to Aspen
Now they hittin' slopes in the bathroom
Put 'em back in rotation

[Pre-Chorus: GENIUS & K Camp]
I just killed a city, what's next? (Yeah)
Took off on my ex, what's next? (Gone)
House up in the hill, what's next? (What's next?)
I been chasin' mils, what's next? (What's next?)

[Chorus: K Camp]
I just copped a coupe, what's next? (What's next?)
Collins with no roof, what's next? (What's next?)
He ain't got no juice, what's next? (What's next?)
Know that I'm the truth, what's next? (Let's go, let's go)
Oh (Oh), oh (Oh), oh (Oh), oh (Oh)
I just copped a coupe, what's next? (Skrrt)
Collins with no roof, what's next?

[Outro]
Hey babe, I've called you like six times
Listen, I know you see me callin' you
Call me back, bye
