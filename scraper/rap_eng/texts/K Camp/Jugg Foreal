[Hook]
Jugg for real, finesse for real
Checks for real, let's be real
Stunt for real, I'm for real
Jugg for real, jugg for real
Jugg for real, let's be real

What you doing?
Jug, jug, jug, jug, jug, jug, jug
Jug, jug, jug, jug, jug
What you doing?
Jug, jug, jug, jug
What you doing?

[Verse 1]
Pull up and stuntin'
Roll me a blunt
I see that ass from the front
A nigga run it, [?]
Run up a check, I got the best, yo nigga ain't talking about nothing
I gotta flex, bring out the jet, bringing a whole lot of blunts
Jugg for real, finesse for real
Checks for real, let's be real
Jugg for real, jugg for real

[Hook]
Jugg for real, finesse for real
Checks for real, let's be real
Stunt for real, I'm for real
Jugg for real, jugg for real
Jugg for real, let's be real

What you doing?
Jug, jug, jug, jug, jug, jug, jug
Jug, jug, jug, jug, jug
What you doing?
Jug, jug, jug, jug

[Verse 2]
Jugg, jugg, jugg, jugg
Flex, flex, flex, flex
Stunting, stunting, stunting, stunting
Checks, checks, checks, checks
College shawty for the sex
Pass the bitch like a test
Fuck her once, leave her wet
I'm only here to collect
Shout out my niggas that say tryna jugg
That nigga lame and he wishing he could
Pushing a foreign, the trunk in the hood
All of my niggas, we up to no good
All of my niggas gon' ride for the play
I'm tryna make me a million today

[Hook]
Jugg for real, finesse for real
Checks for real, let's be real
Stunt for real, I'm for real
Jugg for real, jugg for real
Jugg for real, let's be real

What you doing?
Jug, jug, jug, jug, jug, jug, jug
Jug, jug, jug, jug, jug
What you doing?
Jug, jug, jug, jug
