Rare Sound
XL EAGLE Made It

Verse 1:
Lot of rappers all talk
Can’t believe sh!t that they say
CEO tryna stand up this frito lays
Clocked in need a trip to Machico Bay
Snuck in the olf G &
And I brought you bae
Pop sh!t like snoop
But I think like Dre
Boss movies like Jay but
Makes a 10 boy its not yo day
Spent 10 on a fen boy my drib don’t play
Talking Fendi if you n*ggas ain’t
Knowing designer, shawty bad
I’m just tryna work my move behind her
Hell mah ill never let these n*ggas out shine me
Had to cut n*ggas out
They was moving too slimmey
Had to cut these hoes off too
Ian f**king with you b**he cause you bad news
Yeah you gotta fat ass with some tattoes
But puss* don’t pay the bills baby cash rules
N*ggas thinking I tell off
Hell nah
Had to sit back and observe shit
Yeah I serve shit, fake love creep
Around had to serve sh!t
Hell yeah my last deal was some hurb sh!t
Some birf sh!t
But a n***a was working
A n***a was clocked in
Going through bullshit
But keeping his thoughts in
Put up my own bag
A n*ggas was locked in
Funded my own tour
A n*gga gon flop when
Please don’t compare me to these sap ass n*ggas
No diss I’m just telling what I see ass n*ggas Young Wayy
I’m the one they wanna be ass n*ggas
I done heard a lot of n*ggas tryna steal my flav
Ian tripping let me cook up some brand new waves
Me and interscope gotta find the same damn page
So I can take off and really have my way
Why these n*ggas acting like ian drip in this sh!t
Drop a mixtape then I might drip in ya bi**e
Bet you never said hey I ain’t felling this sh!t
Nah all my sh!t flame lil stud ass bi**h
Damn that was extreme
So excuse my French
Fashion week in New York so excuse my drench
F**k 12 a n*gga had to jump that French
How if you say you ball but you ride that bench can’t flex me and bro
Just don’t mix
I was broke a while back but the sh!t got fixed

Hook:
I work hard for this
Plenty nights I done straved for this
F**k these n*ggas and these b***es too man
I gotta thank God for this
Yeen seen a n*gga drip like this half a mil on whip
Like this man you n*ggas ain’t built like this
Man you n*ggas ain’t built like this
Can I send a vibe yo way
They want me to loose no way
Can I send the vibe yo way
Can I send the vibes
Numb to the pain I can’t feel no more
Hate that my grandma ain’t here no more
Hate that my Cousin ain’t here no more
Pop me a perk I can’t feel no more aye

Outro:
For real
Pop me a perk I can’t feel no more
Numbing the pain I can’t feel no more
Hate that my grandma ain’t here no more
Hate that my Cousin ain’t here no more
I wanna see yo face again
I wanna see your smile again
