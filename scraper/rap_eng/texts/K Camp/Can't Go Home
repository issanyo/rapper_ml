[Intro: GENIUS]
Yeah
Bobby Kritical

[Chorus: GENIUS & K Camp]
World so cold, world so cold (World so cold)
World so cold (World so cold)
Lost my soul chasing hoes
Can't go home (Can't go home, woo)
In Dubai with two hoes (With two hoes)
I'm on the throne (I'm on the throne)
When that flexin' go wrong
That money gone (That money gone)

[Post-Chorus: K Camp]
If you ain't talkin' 'bout no cash, don't call my phone (Brrt)
Days I was broke these niggas laughed, they did me wrong

[Verse 1: K Camp]
Hey, hey, now a young nigga just flexin' up (Flex)
So you know it ain't no catching us
Both of these pockets double stuffed
Young nigga bank account, filled it up
Don't give a damn if you're feelin' us (Yeah)
Started from the mud, yeah, I just need love, yeah
All my life I've been solid (Facts)
Please prove me wrong (Yeah, yeah)
I've been praying on this day
It's been so long (Let's go, hey)

[Chorus: GENIUS & K Camp]
World so cold, world so cold (World so cold)
World so cold (World so cold)
Lost my soul chasing hoes
Can't go home (Can't go home, woo)
In Dubai with two hoes (With two hoes)
I'm on the throne (I'm on the throne)
When that flexin' go wrong
That money gone (That money gone)

[Verse 2: K Camp]
Hey, hey hey, both pockets on stuffed crust
These niggas won't touch us
These bitches gon' lust us (Ayy, ayy)
Back then was the MARTA bus (Woo)
Now niggas in Bentley trucks (Woo)
Stop poppin', we pullin' up (Pull up, pull up, ah, bah)
Toot toot toot (Toot), toot toot toot (Toot, let's go)
That's that forty, out the roof (Forty)
I got forty, on me too (Forty)
Play with shorty, they gon' shoot (Shorty)
Get extorted, for that loot (Extorted)
Niggas ain't real, I got proof (Woo)
If I ain't got nothin', (I got you)

[Chorus: GENIUS & K Camp]
World so cold, world so cold (World so cold)
World so cold (World so cold)
Lost my soul chasing hoes
Can't go home (Can't go home, woo)
In Dubai with two hoes (With two hoes)
I'm on the throne (I'm on the throne)
When that flexin' go wrong
That money gone (That money gone)

[Outro: K Camp]
Hey-ey-ey-ey-ey (Can't go home)
Can't go home, no (Can't go home)
All my life I've been solid, please prove me wrong
I've been praying on this day, it's been so long (Can't go home, no)
This shit don't just happen overnight bruh
Especially be a big household name and anything
That shit take years of practice, years of time
That shit not just no overnight
Niggas who come in overnight
Yeah you get hot, yeah, be right out of here in 6, 8 months
Who give a fuck? Who heard of him again?
Oh they heard he was smokin' blow last time we heard of him
You see what I'm sayin? So
I just try to keep my shit consistent and do my shit my way
You gon' see me, I'm here to stay around this bitch
