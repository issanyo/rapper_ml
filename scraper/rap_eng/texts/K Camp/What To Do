[Intro: K Camp]
Can you come over, let's make a movie (movie)
You know the drill, you know how we do it
Keep that, let it run
Wait

[Verse 1: K Camp]
Lead sonic rims 'round the corner (skrrt skrrt, ayy)
Shawty know I'm poppin', you can take a lil trip if you wanna
Smoking out the W, I just lit another U, oh yeah
Ye got that gas on him right now
She got that ass, go 'head, bite down
All of these hoes, it's enough to go 'round (yeah, yeah)
Roll up the paper, I can't do the 'woods (ayy)
I just found out that I'm misunderstood (ayy)
Mixing the Henny up with the Red Bull
Shawty know what's up, she can smell my aroma
Black shades on, with my brothers, no Jonas (ayy)
Skrt skrt, donuts around the corner
Tryna fuck up the whole summer (ayy)

[Chorus: K Camp]
I know you know exactly where I'm at
I know you know exactly where it's at
Pull up in that Porsche all black
Hot boy, what you call that?
I know you know exactly where I'm at
I know you know exactly where it's at
Pull up in that Porsche all black
Hot boy, what you call that?
Shawty she know what to do, do
Shawty she know how to move, move
I had that pussy one time
Don't make me pull up on you
Shawty she know what to do
Shawty she know how to move, move
I had that pussy one time
Don't make me pull up on you

[Verse 2: Ye Ali]
Word 'round the city, girl you a bad ting (bad)
Make love in the bathroom
Knock that pussy out like one-two (knock it out)
Let's make a movie, you got the best view (ooh)
That pussy break up happy homes, they should arrest you
Baby you know I'm so picky (picky)
Condom right there on the dresser, ayy
You walk around in them Vicky Secrets and I love when you wear them Giuseppes, ayy
Baby the way you keep moving, ayy
I might just cancel that Uber, ayy
I might like text you tomorrow and tell you that I see your ass in my future
Come over and

[Chorus: K Camp]
I know you know exactly where I'm at
I know you know exactly where it's at
Pull up in that Porsche all black
Hot boy, what you call that?
I know you know exactly where I'm at
I know you know exactly where it's at
Pull up in that Porsche all black
Hot boy, what you call that?
Shawty she know what to do, do
Shawty she know how to move, move
I had that pussy one time
Don't make me pull up on you
Shawty she know what to do
Shawty she know how to move, move
I had that pussy one time
Don't make me pull up on you

[Outro: K Camp]
Yeah, yeah
Pull up in that Porsche all black (all black)
Hot boy, what you call that? (yeah yeah yeah)
Pull up in that Porsche all black
Hot boy, what you call that?
