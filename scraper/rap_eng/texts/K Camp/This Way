[Hook]
Something 'bout her got me feeling this way
Out here hustling, I'm just trying to maintain
It's not my birthday but I'm all over that cake

[Verse 1]
You know a young nigga too smooth like butter
Making all the plays, you can come join the huddle
I ain't saying shit like a dog with a muzzle
Figured out the game, got the pieces to the puzzle
Got a new bitch, she ain't got no standards
Magic City Monday, baby welcome to Atlanta
Shawty got flavor, she remind me of a Fanta
Take her to the H, put the deuce in a Fanta
Excuse me but I'm on right now
She only want a nigga cause I'm on right now
You see, young nigga got his own right now
Money conversations on the phone right now

[Hook]
Something 'bout her got me feeling this way
Out here hustling, I'm just trying to maintain
It's not my birthday but I'm all over that cake

[Verse 2]
It ain't no problem, anytime we can do it
Light another L, I'm just living through the music
If I throw it at you, promise that you won't lose it
Claiming you gon' ride, baby you just got to prove it
Sipping on that purple drank, got 'em moving slow
Fuck the other side, I'ma get it 'til it's over
NYC feel arrogant a show
Pouring up the Hennessy 'til it's running over
Excuse me but I'm on right now
She only want a nigga cause I'm on right now
You see, young nigga got his own right now
Money conversations on the phone right now

[Hook]
Something 'bout her got me feeling this way
Out here hustling, I'm just trying to maintain
It's not my birthday but I'm all over that cake
