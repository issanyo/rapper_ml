[Intro: K Camp]
Oh my God
She chose me 'cause her last man was fraud
Hold your applause
Natra
I’m in London, got my beat from London

[Chorus: Paxquiao]
I got it bad for you
Headfirst, might be a dummy, I'ma crash for you
Her bond so strong, that everlasting love
No I can't lie, lil’ shawty mine, it ain't no passin' her
(Oh, I got it bad for you)
Oh, girl you know I fuck with you, why can't you see it?
If I said I love you, I really mean it
They scared to pass, shouldn't've passed out on that mat
Baby girl, I got it bad

[Verse 1: Paxquiao]
Got it bad for you, baby, got a nigga goin' brazy
A lot of ups and downs but you stuck around
Yeah, I fuck with you
I ain't expect to fall in love with you
You can tell me all of your problems
Call me whenever, no problem
Anything you want, you can have it, hey
I told her grab it, hey
She get wet like fountain, we get high like mountain
I know I be fuckin’ up but you stay by my side
Got it bad for you, I can’t lie
Go to war for you, if it's smoke, you know I’m on the way
Travel the world for you
Wait 'round, stay 'round, and see what I got in store for you
They lyin', they tryna keep us apart
My heart, I’m pourin' for you, baby

[Chorus: Paxquiao]
I got it bad for you
Headfirst, might be a dummy, I'ma crash for you
Her bond so strong, that everlasting love
No I can't lie, lil' shawty mine, it ain't no passin' her
(Oh, I got it bad for you)
Oh, girl you know I fuck with you, why can't you see it?
If I said I love you, I really mean it
They scared to pass, shouldn't've passed out on that mat
Baby girl, I got it bad

[Verse 2: K Camp]
I found my lover (Yeah, can you dig that?)
Know I fuck with you, yeah, if you meet my mother
You get mad, I like that
Uh, I'll be right back, eat you like a light snack
Place that head in my lap, uh, that's a night cap
Give me head in the trap, while I count racks
Love me up, baby (Baby)
Get this hug, baby
It's been hard to trust lately (Woo-ooh-ooh-ooh)
If I say I fuck with you, I really mean it
Talkin' dirty but she still the cleanest
Gucci on your toe, that just came out this season
She got it

[Chorus: Paxquiao]
I got it bad for you
Headfirst, might be a dummy, I'ma crash for you
Her bond so strong, that everlasting love
No I can't lie, lil' shawty mine, it ain't no passin' her
(Oh, I got it bad for you)
Oh, girl you know I fuck with you, why can't you see it?
If I said I love you, I really mean it
They scared to pass, shouldn't've passed out on that mat
Baby girl, I got it bad
