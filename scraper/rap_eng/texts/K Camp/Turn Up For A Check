Let me tell you what a nigga told me
Expect nothing don't nobody owe me
Grinding for the check I hustle like Ginobili
So if you talking money you gone have  to show me
I’mma turn up for a check
I’mma pull up in that vet
Make these bitches break they neck
Y'all gone give me my respect
I’mma turn up for a check
I’mma pull up in that vet
Make these bitches break they neck
Y'all gone give me my respect

[Verse]
Look I live my life smoke this weed
And do what the fuck I wanna
Get that right A nigga been nice
Flow just dope no homo VIP that good gas
I know you smell the aroma
As you can see they with me
I keep a few niggas from the courner
Hustle hard for that bred
Millions all in my head
Hungry gotta stay fed
Gotta cover like a shed
Never been no dope dealer
But I swear da God I’m dope nigga
Y'all niggas square like a pope nigga
Better hang it up like a coat nigga
Err time I grab the mic
I swear I speak that real
Put it in work I done sacrifice
And I did this shit without a deal
Ion owe u niggas nothing
Ion give fuck how you feel
I’mma grind hard ‘til I'm dead and gone
For this fucking check that’s for real

[Hook]
Let me tell you what a nigga told me

[Verse]
Ya’ll gone give it to me or I'mma take it
Keep ya main bitch naked
Early morning just finish fucking
Now I'm waking up to that bacon
I’ve been here no mistaking
Talking money situations
Build this shit from the ground up
And now I made my mark quotations
By any means I’mma chase a dream
Gotta put a hater on chill
Since seventeen they been tryna scheme
Boy I am legend like will
Hustle hard done made the team but they steady
Testing my skills now y'all know I'm to cold
I'd give these bitches the chills errbody
Wanna know the scoop on me but u know I stay
Low key if I ain't somewhere chasing that check
I'm somewhere getting good head from a freak
Got these niggas upset cuz I keep it 100
I'ma fool on the beat I ain't really worry about
Next cuz a nigga got now hold on let me preach
