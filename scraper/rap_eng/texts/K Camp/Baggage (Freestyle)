{INTRO}
RARE
SOUND

I'm trynna tell you what's real
I'm trynna tell you the situation
I'm trynna
Open your eyes and let you see
From my point of view

{CHORUS}
Why you be bitchin' and naggin'
Don't wanna deal with your baggage
I'm in the Porsche and the dragon
Baby i'm single, what's happening
Me and you we can make magic
I fell in love with the fashion
I fell in love with her passion
I'm the one bringing the cash in
Check out the drip girl, it's splashin'
Break the hoe down like a fraction
You see the cameras keep flashin'
Watch where you dumping your ashes
She got that fire like a dragon
Wonder why I am attracted
Masion Margiela my glasses
Ain't got no time for relaxin'
Lets go

{VERSE}
Fuck it lets hop in the Porsche
Fuck it lets hop in the Benz
I'm the one setting the trends
Rappers ain't really my friends
Feel like the 1st of the month
I'm trynna bring in the sack
If you play around with the money
Easiest way to get smacked
Easiest way to get whacked
I got excel on the track
Inside the double R black
My money longer than Shaq
My money longer like Uzi
Percocet got the boy whoozy
Shorty you thick like a smoothie
We going up on a tuesday


{CHORUS}
Why you be bitchin' and naggin'
Don't wanna deal with your baggage
I'm in the Porsche and the dragon
Baby i'm single, what's happening
Me and you we can make magic
I fell in love with the fashion
I fell in love with her passion
I'm the one bringing the cash in
Check out the drip girl, it's splashin'
Break the hoe down like a fraction
You see the cameras keep flashin'
Watch where you dumping your ashes
She got that fire like a dragon
Wonder why I am attracted
Masion Margiela my glasses
Ain't got no time for relaxin'

{VERSE}
Ain't got no time for no fakes
Can't put my foot on the brakes
I do whatever it takes
Know that i'm watching the snakes
Yeah I done made some mistakes
Bitch that's the price to be great
I put a price on your head
I'm doing number like drake
Dunk on a bitch like i'm blake
I'm trynna blow out the cake
I'm trynna own an estate
I'm trynna fly out the states
Gimme some head in a Wraith
Shorty you gotta embrace
A nigga like me, I create
Gotta know i'm awake

{CHORUS}
Why you be bitchin' and naggin'
Don't wanna deal with your baggage
I'm in the Porsche and the dragon
Baby i'm single, what's happening
Me and you we can make magic
I fell in love with the fashion
I fell in love with her passion
I'm the one bringing the cash in
Check out the drip girl, it's splashin'
Break the hoe down like a fraction
You see the cameras keep flashin'
Watch where you dumping your ashes
She got that fire like a dragon
Wonder why I am attracted
Masion Margiela my glasses
Ain't got no time for relaxin'
