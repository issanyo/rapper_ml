[Hook: K Camp]
Just take a hit of this, it'll get you right
Don't worry bout nothin', turn up the night
You want more in your life but you can't get right
Don't worry bout nothin', just turn up the night
Turn up the night (16x)

[Verse 1: K Camp]
Look, girl, let loose cause I know just what you like
It's all on you if you wanna turn up the night
So many blunts that my mind somewhere in space
Push pause on a ho cause she won't stay out my face
I ain't worried bout nothin', I ain't worried bout nothin'
I just came here to have a good time
Yeah, that drank in me and that smoke in me
Yeah, I'm turnt in this bitch, no lie
All that ass on her, can't pass on her
I'mma steal yo' bitch, no crime
I'mma get to the money, I'mma shine til the end
Get back, don't worry bout mine
Drinks in the air and I came wit' my crew
No, we don't care, we gon' turn up on you
Haters, they gone stare, tell 'em watch what we do
Turn up, yeah, I know you feel somethin'
To be real, I ain't worried bout nothin'

[Hook: K Camp]
Just take a hit of this, it'll get you right
Don't worry bout nothin', turn up the night
You want more in your life but you can't get right
Don't worry bout nothin', just turn up the night
Turn up the night (16x)

[Verse 2: B.o.B]
Always with a real bitch, a weak bitch gets left alone
Nobody got time for bitches that got more issues than bold
We taking shots of Henny while passing shots of Patron
You don't drink or smoke or dance then keep yo' weak ass at home
Girl, we can turn up and kick it and twist it whenever you feel it
No matter the day or the time or the hour, the second, the minute
Start in the car and pull up to the crib, ended up in the kitchen
Whatever we doing, whatever we did, it ain't nobody business
Ain't nobody business, girl, it ain't nobody business
But, if you did the crew, and they know it too
Fuck it, can I get a witness?
Don't ask why they hands to the ceiling
It's probably cause Bobby Bands in the building
The dancers is twerking, the panties is peeling
That boy there a fool, he a animal, isn't he?

[Hook: K Camp]
Just take a hit of this, it'll get you right
Don't worry bout nothin', turn up the night
You want more in your life but you can't get right
Don't worry bout nothin', just turn up the night
Turn up the night (16x)
