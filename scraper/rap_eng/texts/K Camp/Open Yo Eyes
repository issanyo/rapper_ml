[Hook: True Story Gee]
Aye, I been shooting dice all day lil shawty
You ain't gotta keep calling
Heard he popping shit, baby he ain't really 'bout it
I just wanna know, wanna know if you a rider
You ain't gotta lie, I won't tell nobody
I'ma keep quiet, shawty I'ma keep quiet
Playing with no band got you playing both sides
Baby open yo eyes
I'm a real nigga baby I'ma keep quiet
Baby open yo eyes
I'm a real nigga baby I'ma keep quiet

[Verse 1: True Story Gee]
Aye, I'm a real nigga baby I'ma stay solid
Every where I go I gotta tote a Glock 40
I don't want no beef with them boys they informants
In a tee and some Jordans
I know these niggas don't like me and shit
But that's on me they won't try me and shit
If I go down will you write me and shit?
Do you like me and shit?
I'm pulling up anytime about you
Like how you look I be staring at you
I turn you up I put red on your shoe
You look right in them Loubs
Ain't never lonely I stay with it on me
Kiss on your body I know that you want it
Can you love me at the same be my homie?
Never let a nigga play with you and I'm on it
And you stay right there
Now I got racks and you still right there
I went to Cali two times on a flight
Might get a crib out there
Hold me so tight cause it's real outchea
Don't give a damn how they feel about you
Ain't gotta care about a damn thing shawty
I'ma keep it trill 'bout you
Might do a 100 on the highway tryna get to you
Ain't stopping for no cars I swear
Got into it with some lil niggas round the way
Had to look both sides my lil' shawty right there
I know sometimes I act like I don't care
But you know that I'ma ride for you girl
I get up there right in front of the judge
Don't care 'bout that time when you lied for me girl
No hoe better get wrong with lil shawty
I tote that fire for you girl
I been getting money all day with my woes
Ain't nobody trying you girl

[Bridge]
Ain't nobody trying you girl
Ain't nobody trying you girl
Ain't nobody trying you girl
Ain't nobody trying you girl

[Verse 2: K Camp]
You a real one and I peeked that shit
Might let you meet my bitch
You know a nigga like to creep and shit
But you the one I creep with
Sex in the morning
Put this dick in while you yawning
She said she like my performance
Kissing whats under your garments
I know it ain't easy
To deal with a nigga like me
She said baby please me
The way you talk you can be wifey
Yeah I know your ex ain't nothing like me
I'm a real nigga and my life pricey
I swear these ratchet hoes don't excite me
Got stripes like Adidas, checks like Nike
Girl open yo eyes
Don't be surprised
There's a reason why we linked up
Girl this a blessing in disguise

[Hook: True Story Gee]
Aye, I been shooting dice all day lil shawty
You ain't gotta keep calling
Heard he popping shit, baby he ain't really 'bout it
I just wanna know, wanna know if you a rider
You ain't gotta lie, I won't tell nobody
I'ma keep quiet, shawty I'ma keep quiet
Playing with no band got you playing both sides
Baby open yo eyes
I'm a real nigga baby I'ma keep quiet
Baby open yo eyes
I'm a real nigga baby I'ma keep quiet

[Outro]
Oh oh oh...
