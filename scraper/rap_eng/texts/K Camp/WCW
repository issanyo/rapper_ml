[Chorus]
That's my boo
I'ma make sure everything new
I'ma put her in a brand new coupe
I'ma put her in a brand new coupe
That's my boo
I'ma make sure everything new
I'ma put her in a brand new coupe
Show the bitch how a young nigga move
Let's get it
Let's get it
Let's get it
Let's get it
Let's get it
That's my boo
I'ma make sure everything new
I'ma put her in a brand new coupe
Show the bitch how a young nigga move
Let's get it

[Verse 1]
Flew her in the city, had to show her how I live
Filled up on that liquor, holdin' weight like Uncle Phil
Love the way she fuck me, love the way she keep it real
Put her on some bitches, now them bitches tryna chill (let's go)
Ayy, show me the truth tonight
Let's take off the roof tonight
Jump in the coupe tonight (skrrt, skrrt, skrrt)
Ayy, buy you some shoes tonight
Let's fuck in the pool tonight
Break all the rules tonight just 'cause

[Chorus]
That's my boo
I'ma make sure everything new
I'ma put her in a brand new coupe
I'ma put her in a brand new coupe
That's my boo
I'ma make sure everything new
I'ma put her in a brand new coupe
Show the bitch how a young nigga move
Let's get it
Let's get it
Let's get it
Let's get it
Let's get it
That's my boo
I'ma make sure everything new
I'ma put her in a brand new coupe
Show the bitch how a young nigga move
Let's get it

[Verse 2]
We can skip the talkin', straight to fuckin' if you wanna
Baby it go down when you mix Hen' and marijuana
Don't get shawty started, act retarded when it's drama
Ask her where she got it and she said straight from her mama
Let's go, ayy
Let's make a move tonight
Call up the crew tonight
Bring out the zoo tonight
Ayy, find out your mood tonight
Actin' a fool tonight
Got somethin' to prove tonight, just 'cause

[Chorus]
That's my boo
I'ma make sure everything new
I'ma put her in a brand new coupe
I'ma put her in a brand new coupe
That's my boo
I'ma make sure everything new
I'ma put her in a brand new coupe
Show the bitch how a young nigga move
Let's get it
Let's get it
Let's get it
Let's get it
Let's get it
That's my boo
I'ma make sure everything new
I'ma put her in a brand new coupe
Show the bitch how a young nigga move
Let's get it
