[Intro]
'Bout time
Big Money
Big Song
We got London On Da Track

[Chorus]
These bitches on me
Bitches on me
I can't trust you I got traded by my homies
If it ain't money, it ain't for me
If you play around wit my family, it'll get ugly
Say you loyal but you lying to my face
I can't see you all this money in the way
These bitches on me
Bitches on me
I can't trust you I got traded by my homies

[Verse 1]
I say fuck them hoes, fuck em all fuck em all
I ain't cuffin no, cut em off cut em off
Fuck twelve, fuck the law fuck the law
Shawty low, done it all done it all
You broke, right
The hoe life
Woah, right
Roll the fucking dice
Never sold one
You don't know the coat price
Bust a [?]
I know what i'm doing
Wish you would, wish a nigga would
Count the money, recount it
On the block, posted up rebounding
I want a streets family
Your nigga be about it
These niggas only
These bitches on me

[Chorus]
These bitches on me
Bitches on me
I can't trust you I got traded by my homies
If it ain't money, it ain't for me
If you play around wit my family, it'll get ugly
Say you loyal but you lying to my face
I can't see you all this money in the way
These bitches on me
Bitches on me
I can't trust you I got traded by my homies

[Verse 2]
Switchin sides, that ain't cool
Get a life, cause that ain't you yea yea
Lately, I been fuckin' hoes without dating
No no no she ain't a dime that's a eight piece
Dressed in all black look like Beijing
You know you can't play me I don't play fair
Traded to the other team nigga stay there
Niggas need me, I know I don't need no move
Bitch niggas, they Bobby Valentino hoes
They been fucking to the max
I been rolling up these stacks
I got London on da track

[Chorus]
These bitches on me
Bitches on me
I can't trust you I got traded by my homies
If it ain't money, it ain't for me
If you play around wit my family, it'll get ugly
Say you loyal but you lying to my face
I can't see you all this money in the way
These bitches on me
Bitches on me
I can't trust you I got traded by my homies
