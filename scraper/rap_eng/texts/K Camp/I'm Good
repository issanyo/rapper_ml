[Hook]
When it rains I think of you
When all them nights I was there with you
Through the pain, why you do me like that?
Turned your back
But don't worry, girl I'm good
I'm good, I'm good
I'm good, girl I'm good
What's in the past gon' stay there
I can't make the same mistakes therefore I'm good
I told a thousand lies to prevent the cries
Now it's good bye cause I realized I'm good
Now I done moved on, feeling gone
I'm good

[Verse 1]
She say that I'm acting different
She say I'm not the same nigga
Last time I checked when I looked in the mirror
Bitch I was the same nigga
But I do apologize for all them times I made you cry
Even though I tried to make that bullshit work
Guess we couldn't see eye to eye
And I'm not the guy that you fantasize
You couldn't hold on that I'm on the rise
Now I got a new bitch, don't act surprised
I'm just a young nigga tryna multiply
My bankroll, and I know I'm not perfect at all
Just want to know are you there when I fall?
If ain't real I don't want it at all
Will you be there when I call?

[Hook]
When it rains I think of you
When all them nights I was there with you
Through the pain, why you do me like that?
Turned your back
But don't worry, girl I'm good
I'm good, I'm good
I'm good, girl I'm good
What's in the past gon' stay there
I can't make the same mistakes therefore I'm good

[Verse 2]
Time go by and I see you
That yo ass got a brand new nigga
I just hope that you happy
I just hope that you happy
And I ain't gon' lie, yah it be some nights
That I really do miss you
But I just hope that you happy
I just hope that you happy
But he can't fuck you like I do
Can't fuck you like I do
Lick you up, now turn your ass around
And I hit it from the back like boom
I done packed my bags and my suitcase full
Baby ain't no room
So I ain't really worried about you
I ain't really worried about you
But I know

[Hook]
When it rains I think of you
When all them nights I was there with you
Through the pain, why you do me like that?
Turned your back
But don't worry, girl I'm good
I'm good, I'm good
I'm good, girl I'm good
What's in the past gon' stay there
I can't make the same mistakes therefore I'm good
I told a thousand lies to prevent the cries
Now it's good bye cause I realized I'm good
Now I done moved on, feeling gone
I'm good

[Outro]
I swear they all the same, I swear they all the same
I swear they all the same, I swear they all the same
I swear they all the same, I swear they all the same
I heard she want love, I don't believe that
Cause everywhere I go these hoes be the same
She really asking where the cheese at
It really ain't nothing for me to pick your brain
But I learned
I swear they all the same, I swear they all the same
I swear they all the same, I swear they all the same
I swear they all the same, I swear they all the same
She don't know my name, she just see the chains
And she want the fame, girl stay in yo lane
She must love the pain cause she will never change
I thought you was different, maybe I was trippin'
Maybe I was trippin', learn from my mistakes
You can get replaced, look at me I'm straight
But I learned
I swear they all the same, I swear they all the same
I swear they all the same, I swear they all the same
I swear they all the same, I swear they all the same
I swear they all the same
