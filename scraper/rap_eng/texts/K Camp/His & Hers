[Intro]
Rare Sound

[Chorus]
She got her own (ha)
She got her own
She got her own (let's go)
She got her own (hey!)
If you pull up, she gon’ pull up too
You can buy that, she can buy that too
She got her own (yeah)

[Post-Chorus]
Shawty just a bad bitch with her own shit
She don’t need you to buy her a outfit (ha)
Walk into the Louis store, gotta have it (yeah)
Say you on IG I had to tag it
She got her own (ha)
She got her own (wait)

[Verse 1]
Yup, yup, yup
Boss bitch, a boss bitch, you’re a boss bitch
You know that nigga was weak, he almost lost it
He couldn’t handle a girl with all that profit
And you can handle one nigga that’s on that nonsense
Hey hey, hey hey, it's your day
When she get on that Hen', she want that foreplay
When she get on that 'Tron, she get on that K-way
I just made about 20 you know that's light pay (yeah)
You say that most these niggas act full gay
She just want a real nigga that's gon lay lay (yup)
Pipe down, just pipe down, we here now
When I'm feenin' that pussy give you the stare down
Scare now, you scared now, don't fade away
Get rid of that fuck nigga, he a throwaway
She gon' facetime everytime I go away
When that shit is real, boy that shit don't go away

[Chorus]
She got her own (she ain't worried about y'all niggas)
She got her own (she gon' get it regardless)
She got her own (yeah)
She got her own (ha, what you talkin' about?)
If you pull up, she gon' pull up too
You can buy that, she can buy that too
She got her own (yeah)
Let's go

[Post-Chorus]
Shawty just a bad bitch with her own shit
She don't need you to buy her a outfit (outfit)
Walk into the Louis store, gotta have it
Say you on IG I had to tag it
She got her own
She got her own

[Verse 2]
She don't want no broke boy (broke boy), broke boy (broke boy), broke boy (broke boy)
She don't want no broke boy (broke boy), broke boy (broke boy), broke boy (broke boy)
I love the way you do those things that you do
You ain't gotta flex for him or you
I'mma send a text, tell you to come through
She onto the next, she ain't even want you
Boss bitch baby (boss), Glock off safety
Fire a nigga up if you're fuckin' with my lady
Wrist on froze, mo'fucka icy
Fuckin' with a shawty, she a boss like me

[Chorus]
She got her own (let's go)
She got her own (ha)
She got her own (yup)
She got her own
