[Chorus: Money Man]
This shit I’m doing ain’t typical
Let the chopper paint a visual
Break a brick like an arm
Spend a brick on a charm
This shit I’m doing ain’t typical
This shit I’m doing ain’t typical
Break a brick like an arm
Spend a brick on a charm
Lil mama body perfection
We keep them straps for protection
She got a body like a goddess
Water diamonds dripping like a faucet
This shit I’m doing ain’t typical
This shit I’m doing ain’t typical
Break a brick like an arm
Spend a brick on a charm

[Verse 1: K Camp]
I ain’t trappin’ but money here
But I can tell you where the money is
I can tell you a funny kid
Background like an adlib
Break a brick like an arm
Twenty K for the charm
We got chickens like a farm
Broccoli like DRAM
Don’t confuse me with so and so
Eating shrimp off in Oppalo
Rocking Gucci with the open toe
She gon’ let a nigga poke her throat
Hit a nigga with a MAC
Shout out boo off in Magic
Play the bitch like Madden
I’m that nigga, I ain’t braggin’

[Chorus: Money Man]
This shit I’m doing ain’t typical
Let the chopper paint a visual
Break a brick like an arm
Spend a brick on a charm
This shit I’m doing ain’t typical
This shit I’m doing ain’t typical
Break a brick like an arm
Spend a brick on a charm
Lil mama body perfection
We keep them straps for protection
She got a body like a goddess
Water diamonds dripping like a faucet
This shit I’m doing ain’t typical
This shit I’m doing ain’t typical
Break a brick like an arm
Spend a brick on a charm

[Verse 2: Moneybagg Yo]
This shit I’m doing ain’t normal
I came up, call it karma, yeah
You niggas act like informants
Young nigga hot like a sauna
The chopper I’m toting so difficult
It don’t take bullets, it take missiles
I don’t got goons, I got hitters
Steph Curry with the pistols
Hugh Heffner with the hoes
Slanging bowls with my woes
She put that coke to her nose
Got a nigga like woah
I poured a four then I dozed, off
In a foreign how I drove, off
I’m riding with guns, a brick of that soft
I’m going federal if I get caught

[Chorus: Money Man]
This shit I’m doing ain’t typical
Let the chopper paint a visual
Break a brick like an arm
Spend a brick on a charm
This shit I’m doing ain’t typical
This shit I’m doing ain’t typical
Break a brick like an arm
Spend a brick on a charm
Lil mama body perfection
We keep them straps for protection
She got a body like a goddess
Water diamonds dripping like a faucet
This shit I’m doing ain’t typical
This shit I’m doing ain’t typical
Break a brick like an arm
Spend a brick on a charm
