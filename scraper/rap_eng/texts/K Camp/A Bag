[Intro: Sauce Walka]
You see what the problem is man, niggas out here lazy. You know what I'm saying like they wanna sit up in the house all day, lay up in the bed, know what I'm saying, watch tv, look at sportscenter. You better get a bag nigga

[Hook: Sauce Walka and K Camp]
I had to get me a bag
I had to get me a bag
I had to get me a bag
I had to get me a bag
After filling up my cash
Want a bitch white smash
Splicka splicka dash
I had to go get me a bag
I had to go get me a bag
I had to go get me a bag
I had to go get me a bag
Splicka splicka dash
Little bitch white smash (Yuh)
I just made a bunch of cash (Yuh)
Lazy niggas on they ass (Yuh)
I had to go get me a bag

[Verse 1: Sauce Walka]
A bag, a bag, a bag just splash
Had to make a bunch of cash
Couldn't be a lazy nigga on my ass
Mamma wasn't doing nothing, she was smoking
Class clown nigga, still joking
Meanwhile, I'm hungry as hell in the trap house, stomach bulking
So I got up in the streets
Had go and get some cheese
Drug dealing, Selling keys
So I started with a B
Found out that ain't for me
Cuz I went to the pen
Found a bad bitch that put the hunnid dollars in my hand
I ain't going back again

[Hook: Sauce Walka and K Camp]

Splicka splicka dash
I had to go get me a bag
I had to go get me a bag
I had to go get me a bag

Little bitch white smash (I had to go get me a bag)
I just made a bunch of cash
Lazy niggas on they ass (Yuh)
I had to go get me a bag

[Verse 2: K Camp]
Had to go get me a bag (A bag)
Just put my bitch in a jag (A jag)
Ever since me and Walka lit, I had to let go of that swag (Wooh)
Put my little bitch on a corner (Corner)
You are looking at a stoner (Stoner)
Took her right to the condo, fucked that bitch right into a coma (Wooh)
Splash splash splash splash (Splash)
Drip drip drip drip (Drip)
9 milli on my hip (Pop)
A thousand bitches on my dick (Hey)
My twenties going to carry that flag (That flag)
Fucking your bitch, now you mad (You mad)
Turn up and give her that dab (That dab)
I had to go get me a bag (Yuh)
