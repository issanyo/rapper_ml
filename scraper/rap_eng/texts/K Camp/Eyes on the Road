[sample]
Just ride with a nigga
Get fly with a nigga
It'll be alright
You gon' get by with a nigga
(x 4)

[Pre-Chorus]
I know it's niggas getting high for the lows
High for the lows
And I can see you gettin' tired of the lows
You getting' tired of the lows
My nigga every time you ride with your bros
Ride with your bros
Know if you got drive, keep your eyes on the road
Keep your eyes on the road. Keep your eyes on the road
Woah

[Verse 1]
They killed my brother on the news today
Police pulled up and let the Ruger spray
Now I got survivors guilt every time I make it through the day
Tell me what we gotta do today
I'm just tryna give all my niggas a nugget of hope
Getting they fixes cause fuck it they broke
Walkin' round  with their pride and a pistol tucked in they coat
You feeling upstream stuck in your boat
Tel all my niggas that Your black is so beautiful bro you came from your momma
Naija boy staying away from wahala
You Got the game from ya father
Make sense of the world and save up your dollar
And you can't wait to be the king, Simba need you a Nala
But now rent is due. Don't know what you finna do
12 on your ass, even when your hands 10 & 2
Niggas say they feel you, when they only pretendin' to
Drownin' in it all, jus make this interlude and inner tube

[Pre-Chorus]
I know it's niggas getting high for the lows
High for the lows
And I can see you gettin' tired of the lows
You getting' tired of the lows
My nigga every time you ride with your bros
Ride with your bros
Know if you got drive, keep your eyes on the road
Keep your eyes on the road. Keep your eyes on the road

[Chorus]
Young nigga keep your eyes on the road
Keep your eyes on the road
Keep your eyes on the road
[x3]

[Verse 2]
I know nigas that I came u with that's on the same shit
Cab't go back to the bull shit bitch, I peep the game quick
Catch me in a mansion with tho bitches watching Shameless
Smoking blunts getting top, yeah I"m on that gang shit
Streets dangerous
I'm not the same , bitch I"m famous
Can't walk around the mall without a nigga point in' fingers
Bitch I'm paranoid, is you my fan or my enemy
Say you fuck with me, in your eyes I see the jealousy
Momma said you dealin' with a lot, you need some therapy
Just gimme a blunt inside a yacht, I"m feeling heavenly
Met a bad bitch, I think she said her name was Ebony
Stole the pussy from my nigga, that might be a felony
I can't wait to pass these pussy niggas that's ahead of me
"Aye Camp, you the goat!" I swear it's what the people telling' me
Stack that blue cheese, baby, can't forget the celery
I be in the hills, in LA with a Beverly

[Pre-Chorus]
I know it's niggas getting high for the lows
High for the lows
And I can see you gettin' tired of the lows
You getting' tired of the lows
My nigga every time you ride with your bros
Ride with your bros
Know if you got drive, keep your eyes on the road
Keep your eyes on the road. Keep your eyes on the road

[Chorus]
Young nigga keep your eyes on the road
Keep your eyes on the road
Keep your eyes on the road
[x3]

[Verse 3]
Stay on your grind that's what I advise
Cause idle eyes tend to idolize
They selling dreams but I don't buy the lies
Ride or die if my bruddah bring home beef then
I'm coming with it like a side of fries
Make an itemized list of rappers fucking with me
Find them guys
And they gon' end up getting sodomized
Pardon my French nigga nigga
But it's niggas in Paris
Asked you what you make a show
And now you niggas embarrassed
I done got popping. I'll be damned if I go quiet again
You only on cause niggas signing they friends
I'm finna off'em again
These niggas talking out the side of they neck
Till that fade at the side of ya head
I know it's niggas waking up leaving dreams at the side of they bed
Tryna make a living before police deciding they dead
Paranoia got you jumping out the side of your head
Just get baked without dividing your bread
I know ya niggas getting high

[Pre-Chorus]
I know it's niggas getting high for the lows
High for the lows
And I can see you gettin' tired of the lows
You getting' tired of the lows
My nigga every time you ride with your bros
Ride with your bros
Know if you got drive, keep your eyes on the road
Keep your eyes on the road. Keep your eyes on the road

[Chorus]
Young nigga keep your eyes on the road
Keep your eyes on the road
Keep your eyes on the road
[x3]
