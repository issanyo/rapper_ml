[Hook: Tha Joker]
I don't think she fell in love with me
She fell in love with dick
I can't stand no trifling bitch that run her mouth all up in my shit
All that yapping, all that talking, make me wanna call it quits
But the way she suck that dick and throw it back I love that shit
Make a nigga say, wooh Oh Lord
Make a nigga say, wooh Oh Lord
Make a nigga say, wooh Oh Lord
Make a nigga say, wooh Oh Lord

[Verse 1: K Camp]
Know this bitch named Britney
She goin' fuck me off the muscle
With no hesitation
Straight to bustin' just like trouble
Pop the Miley Cyrus
Now it's time for levitation
GPS that pussy
Now I found my destination
Try to play a player
You goin' fuck around get played
So many roaches in that ash tray
We might just need some raid
She just wanna play
I'm with the games, like an arcade
Pussy wet, ass fat
She tryna blow like a grenade
Aye, what it is (ho)
I know that you don't love me, keep it real (ho)
You just love the dick and how it feel (ho)
So what I do around is not yo biz (ho)
For real (ho)

Make a nigga say, wooh Oh Lord
Make a nigga say, wooh Oh Lord
