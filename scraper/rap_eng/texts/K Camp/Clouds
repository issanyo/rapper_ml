[Intro: K Camp]
Ooh-ooh

[Chorus: K Camp]
My head in the clouds every time that I think of you (Hah, hah)
They tell me don't worry, I know what I'm feeling is true (Yeah yeah, yeah)
Blue skies and they fallin', I am not myself around you (Woo)
'Cause my head in the clouds every time that I think of you (Yeah, yeah yeah)

[Post-Chorus: K Camp]
Yeah
In the clouds, in the clouds, in the clouds (Yeah)
(Let's go)

[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa & K Camp]
Where you goin'? What you doin'?
That ain't questions that I'm askin'
I'ma let you be free, girl, when you with me (Yeah, yeah)
Hop up in the seat, pour another drink
Roll the weed, now you ridin' with a G so you finna see
How it's supposed to be
How it's supposed to feel
Let me know you're high
Let me know you're down
Let me know it's real
Let me know you wanna chill
Let me know you want some champagne
Or a paper plane, so I know the deal
I been grindin', a lot of time I don't never stop
You been holdin' it down for me while I level up (Ooh)
Usually don't keep 'em round me, no, I don't ever trust
And when we show up, ain't no one in the line ahead of us
Hardly sleep, baby girl, I don't use a bed to rest
Want you to give me your all until there ain't nothing left
I know niggas will buy you (purses, purses)
Sending messages like I leave your feelings hurt
Grindin' since the dirt, now I'm in a vert  (Skrrt, skrrt)
All my niggas put in work (Yeah, yeah)
Baby, every time you see me I look like the better version
Always been that nigga, don't do second, I do first place
Try to play simple with me, that don't work
No fakin', just keep it G, I prefer (Ooh)
Drunk than a bitch, ridin' 'round with my niggas
I'm rollin' that weed up and mixin' that liquor, got

[Chorus: K Camp & Wiz Khalifa]
My head in the clouds every time that I think of you
(That's hard, you know I always gotta say that)
They tell me don't worry, I know what I'm feeling is true (Yeah yeah, yeah)
Blue skies and they fallin', I am not myself around you (Woo)
'Cause my head in the clouds every time that I think of you (Yeah, yeah yeah)

[Post-Chorus: K Camp]
Yeah
In the clouds, in the clouds, in the clouds (Yeah)
(Let's go)

[Verse 2: K Camp]
Head in the sky, head in the sky, whoa, whoa
See it in your eyes, you don't wanna cry, no, no (Yeah, yeah)
I know you a prize, you don't want goodbyes no more
I realize you can't be the side, no, no
Workin' on myself, you know I need help
You tired of these hoes, I'm tired myself
Played with your heart, I know that didn't help
You told me get right, instead I went left, man
You are a tough one to please
I can see you with my seeds (Ooh)
I can see you on the coast, feel the breeze
I'm on my knees, beggin' you please, 'cause

[Chorus: K Camp]
My head in the clouds every time that I think of you (Hah, hah)
They tell me don't worry, I know what I'm feeling is true (Yeah yeah, yeah)
Blue skies and they fallin', I am not myself around you (Woo)
'Cause my head in the clouds every time that I think of you (Yeah, yeah yeah)

[Post-Chorus: K Camp]
Yeah
In the clouds, in the clouds, in the clouds (Yeah)
