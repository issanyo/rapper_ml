[Intro]
Rare Sound
We outchea baby
I have a dream
Ha, ha, look

[Chorus]
Grab a handful, grab a handful (let's go)
Grab a handful, 'cause I can ('cause I can)
Grab a handful, grab a handful (racks)
Grab a handful, I ain't playin' (I ain't playin')
Grab a handful, grab a handful
Grab a handful, fuck you sayin' (fuck you sayin')
Grab a handful, grab a handful
Grab a handful, I ain't playin' (I ain't playin')

[Verse 1]
She said I'm handsome, it's a ransom
And I came for, all the bands
In the Phantom, drivin' reckless
She gon' lick me down, with no hands
OG Lupe, here's your boo bae
How you do [?]? Ion't know
When I pull in, that new AMG, with your baby momma, sorry bro

[Chorus]
Grab a handful, grab a handful (let's go)
Grab a handful, 'cause I can ('cause I can)
Grab a handful, grab a handful (racks)
Grab a handful, I ain't playin' (I ain't playin')
Grab a handful, grab a handful
Grab a handful, fuck you sayin' (fuck you sayin')
Grab a handful, grab a handful
Grab a handful, I ain't playin' (I ain't playin')

[Verse 2]
Gucci duffle full of hunnids, that's a lot wait
Pull at [?], let my baby momma shop with it
How you rich but you still be on the block with it?
Try to juug, fuck around, then go shot
I can't rock with it, they gon' rock (they gon' rock)
Share my clock bitch, word on thot bitches
Grab a handful (yeah), need a handful (yeah)
She a handful (yeah), that's a fact (yeah)

[Chorus]
Grab a handful, grab a handful (let's go)
Grab a handful, 'cause I can ('cause I can)
Grab a handful, grab a handful (racks)
Grab a handful, I ain't playin' (I ain't playin')
Grab a handful, grab a handful
Grab a handful, fuck you sayin' (fuck you sayin')
Grab a handful, grab a handful
Grab a handful, I ain't playin' (I ain't playin')
