Mix the vannies with the skinnies (?)
I went rockstar crazy
Rockstar crazy
Rockstar crazy
Black bandana, sippin' Fanta
I went rockstar crazy
Rockstar crazy

Mix the vannies with the skinnies
I went rockstar crazy
Rockstar crazy
Rockstar crazy
Let's get it

[Verse 1]
Rockstar crazy
Kush got em' lazy
Kill em on occasions
That boy right there basic
CLS Mercedes, pull up on your baby
Pull up on your baby
Might just buy her daisies
Might just buy her Gucci
Let me have that coochie
Bitch look at my fist
YFN like Lucci
Bitch I'm back like Gucci
Four hoes one jacuzzi
Goin' through these phases
Rockstar crazy

[Verse 2]
Rock, pull up on your block
Fuck with me, gunshot
Went up on my stock
Went up on my price
Went up on this ice
Leather with the spice
I might fuck her twice
This Miami Vice
Put that on my life
Goyard with the Gucci
This right here might take your wife
Flex on her just might
Flex on her just might
Flavor with the spice
Drop that check on sight
