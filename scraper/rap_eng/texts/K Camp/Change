[Verse 1: K Camp]
I was six years old
Riding shotgun in an old school with my dad
Memories that I hold on to
Cause really those the only ones that I had
They used to call me Lil' Rock
Skinny big head nigga with a rock
And I ain't talkin' 'bout the hard
Even though my fam used to keep the grams in the socks, damn
It was me, lil Brandon and Nene
Outside running wild, fuck TV
On 13th all the way the 49th and Chambers
Shout out to my lil cuz Veve
And my uncle Jerome
One time for my uncle Jerome
In the basement smoking cigarettes with Tyrique
I think we did that when unc wasn't home
47th and Lloyd, first time I got jumped on the porch
Hit the oldest one with the one two, bink bink
Other one ran up, left him right there on the porch
Hell is you saying? Lil Jeff turned me into a man
That was big bro, that was big cuz
Everything to a nigga now he gone
Guess God had a plan I don't understand
Lord why you do me this way? You live and you learn
Them tables will turn, them bridges will burn
But through it all, just make a way
I'm here to stay and I'ma do it for my city like the mayor
Real northside nigga living life like my grandaddy Charles
He the reason why a nigga is a player

[Hook: K Camp]
Let me talk to 'em, yeah, hah
Plenty nights when I felt all alone, nobody to lean on
Listen up, let me tell you how it feel
Hah, look
I just tell it how it is, everybody claim they real
On the real these niggas ain't ever been real
Straight up, hah, look
I'm just living my life, I'm just doing my thang
Same nigga from the jump, baby I ain't gon' change
Hah, baby I ain't gon' change
Nah, nah, baby I ain't gon' change

[Verse 2: K Camp]
Man fuck everybody do you
Same lil nigga that they said wasn't gon' be the shit is the shit
Who knew?
Still ridin' 'round with my day one niggas
We don't need new niggas in the crew
One time for my nigga Dan
That was my first friend second grade Miss Blue
I don't do too much
Nigga just say what's up, man salute when you see me
These niggas upset cause they heard I got next
I keep cheese like Fellini's
Back in the day I used to be a hot head
Like I'm walkin' 'round with a beanie
In the middle of the summer
I'm just tryna score, nigga, no time to fumble
It's game time, everybody on time
We just tryna get this money at the same time
I ain't claimin' what ain't mine
Got your girl on the edge like the state line
Ain't no mo play time
We just tryna get it off the muscle
Fighting for the money, how much hustlel
I'ma get my bitch to respect my hustle forreal
Man fuck everybody do you
Same lil nigga that they said wasn't gon' be the shit
Is the shit, who knew
Straight up, hah, look
I'm just livin' my life, I'm just doin' my thang
Same nigga from the jump

[Hook: K Camp]
What's the point of getting that money?
Money ain't money if your life don't change
What's the point of pushing that whip
If you ain't changing lanes?
What's the point of having many girls
If your bitch don't change?
What's the point of staying the same
If everything around you change?
I've changed, I've changed, I've changed, I've changed
I've changed, I've changed, I've changed, I've changed
I've changed, I've changed, I've changed, I've changed
I've changed, I've changed
If everything around you changed
All I need is change

[Outro: Jeremih]
You don't need nobody, you don't need nobody
They don't want to be here, they ain't got to be here
You don't need nobody, you don't need nobody
They don't want to be here, they ain't got to be here
