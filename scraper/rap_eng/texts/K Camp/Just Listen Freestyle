Hey man I just touch down a murder bitch
Been in a hotel room, my nigga gor right behind me
Right aftre this verse
He working just like me
Shut up spreat tell

[verse]
I'm the same one from back that day
Your opinion don't matter this way
I remember hot nights in the Rico
Now I'm hotter then the Rico in the summer
Used to ride five deep in the hummer
Black dope, bad dog, with your old lady
That girl gon bust like a three eighty
He ain't got no more call yeah I am greater
Stay down stay down like you 'posed to
Where you come from nigga, I don't know you
Deep baby the nigga act it right
Bitch stop that boy that what a hoe do

How to get it from the bottom? let me show you
Snakes niggas cut em off that's their way
K Camp never asked for a hand out
Had to wait it on my time, no lunch break
These niggas add shots that's too fade
Feel the pain when i spit like two fade
Head jump off busting at the jump off
Trynna play with the money gettin knock off
Like a sinners nigga how to need commas
Yes sir you better watch your baby mama
She just wanna get a whole crude love let me bless that mouth hallelujah!

Late nights on the morning no sleepers
Use to dream 'bout the days in my sleep
Woke up had to make it real life
I don't wanna do it large like a great wife
These bitches love my ambitions
Throw it now she hooked, no fish
Try to coach these niggas on game

Don't talk you lil bitch just listen
Don't talk you lil bitch just listen
Don't talk you lil bitch just listen
Don't talk you lil bitch just listen
Don't talk you lil bitch just listen

Imma show ya how the job get done
That pussy so sweet, honey buns
Just out here trynna have fun
Chasing tho I don't even like to run
I'm the hottest nigga moving in the sun
In the hotel give me all your verse
Dan Diego told me I'm killing yall niggas....
I just need a hearse
Trynna hang with your bitch like a purse
Like Ray J I hit it first
I'm on vaycay feeling up my scored
It's pay day give me that work
These nigga don't know what it took
These nigga don't know how I feel
Plenty years I've been working on this
I just need a hundred mil for the deal
Right now I'm just talk lil reckless
The nigga too greasy like checkers
Imma play a game of checks  not checkers
Either way tho you niggas gon respect us
Everywhere we go we kick it like beckham
These niggas gon play if you let 'em
We gon hit your hoes if we get â€šem
This first fourty eight and Imma kill em
In the club Imma  jump in the crowd
Gotta a hate nigga looking like wow
Throwing balls and I'm sweating yo bitch
Tell her how i move like a cow
These nigga can't do it like this
I can switch it up and do it like that
That hoe stay runnin her mouth
Tell that little bitch fall back

Don't talk little bitch just listen
Don't talk little bitch just listen
Don't talk little bitch just listen
Don't talk little bitch just listen

Turnt up hoe!
