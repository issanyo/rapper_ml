[Chorus: K Camp & Young Starr]
I done got it out the mud that's that shit that made me
That's that shit that made me (x2)

[Verse 1]
Tryna make diamonds from dirt, guess that's the way how it works
I came straight out the hood now you see me by the Burbs
Yeah I'm just living my life, some people wish that they were
And I ain't just been swaggin', nah I'm not braggin' my nigga
100 K miles in plane trips, I ain't leave out the states yet
Getting straight to that payment, jetlagged's an understatement
Middle finger I'm waving, yeah, wherever they're hating
And if they ain't talking money then it's a short conversation
I been stacking up lately, got 'em jockin' my steelo
I hustle hard like I'm Nino - I'm tryna buy a casino
Yeah I'm all bout a profit, fuck who don't like my steelo
I'm just keeping it G tho; Double O, no tuxedo
Raw like 151 proof, I'm straight from the street though
& was raised in the hood where they're toting them things though
I'm the coolest out my click, don't make me turn up the heat though
I ain't even tryna beef tho, cuz while you're worried bout me bro I'm

[Chorus: K Camp & Young Starr]
Late night catch me creeping with your damn ol' lady
Serving swervin on the highway & I'm doing bout 80
I can see them niggas talking but it do not phase me
I done got it out the mud that's that shit that made me
That's that shit that made me (x2)
I done got it out the mud that's that shit that made me
That's that shit that made me (x2)
I done got it out the mud that's that shit that made me
