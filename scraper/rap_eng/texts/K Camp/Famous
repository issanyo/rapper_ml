[Hook: Iamsu]
She just wanna fuck with me cause I'm famous
Closet full of fly shit, that's what them bands did
Niggas hating on me, it don't even make sense
Put the Rollie on my wrist, so they know what time it is
She just wanna fuck with me cause I'm famous
Closet full of fly shit, that's what them bands did
Niggas hating on me, it don't even make sense
Put the Rollie on my wrist, so they know what time it is

[Verse 1: Iamsu]
She fucking with the kid cause she see I came up
And my yayo doze off the rangler
Really from the rich, no I'm not a stranger
Tell me why yo bitch always pull my name up
Cause hoes ain't nothing
Tell me why their boyfriend always cuffing
She know we stay blunted
She took point seven grams and stuffed it
And that's go time, send a text and I'm pulling up in no time
Oh, hit her with the clothes line
250 store accounts for my clothes line

[Hook: Iamsu]

[Verse 2: Dej Loaf]
He just wanna fuck with me cause I'm the one
He got all the drugs and I got all the guns
He know I'm from Detroit, he know I get the job done
I pull up with them bitches them niggas go crazy for
Dej Loaf, lil' smooth ass Dej Loaf
Have a nigga on a leash, he do what I say so
Got the Ghost runnin', I might pull up in a tank doe
Tank on, got these bitches pissed like a race horse
From the D to the A to the Bay
That's, that's me Su and K Camp
No way, no sir I don't let the fame get to me
But you gotta be kidding me

[Verse 3: K Camp]
She just wanna fuck with me cause I'm famous
Fuckin with a slum, it can get dangerous
Same niggas hating, we gonna leave them niggas nameless
They just pissed, they ain't seen a nigga do it like this
Call my nigga Su, tell em bring the freezer
Riding with them bands, feelin like a Brinks truck
You could say whatever girl, I know you need us
Bitch depending on how you act maybe we can link up
Count the money fast but I spend it real slow
Had it to myself, I'll never go broke
Had it to myself, I will never do the most
Only celebrate wins, everyday I gotta go
