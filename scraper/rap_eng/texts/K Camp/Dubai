Ain't no tellin' we do what we does
Every time that we fuck this shit up
Fuck this shit up, we came to fuck this shit up

[Verse 1: Jeremih]
I say hello kitty to my hoes
All Balenciagas for my toes
I get paid in gold out for my shows
Came to fuck shit up now with my bros
Just got a call from Croatia
Big money conversation
All models yeah they just do what I say
And I don't ever gotta say shit
She pop that ass back, I'ma fuck it up
If you ain't get no money, suck it up
Bend it over, make a bag, got the bands just to break 'em up
They ain't know, throwin' dough like Marino
Fuck shit up, that's just what we do
Had to hit her with the lingo
Talkin' bout you know my Dino

Every time that we fuck this shit up
Fuck this shit up, we came to fuck this shit up

[Verse 2: K Camp]
Fuck it up, fuck it up
Ridin' around with my (?) stuff
Gucci rag with the Cartier
Know some goons ridin' with the semi tucked
Fuck this up, fuck this up
Got a mil but it ain't enough
Shawty is you down to fuck or what?
Jeremih tell these hoes what's up
Fuck up your party, fuck up your house, we did that
After party might end up in your mouth, we did that
Yeah, yeah
Rollie on, that's a 30 P
Hit the club with a 30 P
Get that thirsty ho from under me

[Verse 3: Wiz Khalifa]
You know it's hard out here for a pimp
I don't even know what I spent
Smokin' weed 'bout to get low in the Bentley
Taylor Gang no we ain't friendly
Bout to put gin in my Simply
Got your main bitch in my whip
Goon on my side got that thing on his hip
Tony Montana must think I'm the shit
Shorty got on a new Taylor Gang fitted
Came home, it was hard to explain it
Tatted like pockets
You fuckin' or not? Take your bitch on a trip just like Janet
Khalifa man out of this planet
Now these little niggas can't stand it
My diamonds like Bieber, they dancin'
My bitch from the Island and she speak Spanish

[Hook]
Yeah I came to fuck this shit up
I came to fuck this shit up
Yeah I came to fuck this shit up

You know I came, you know I came

Swear my Rollie be cuttin' no rug
Yeah these bitches, they swear I'm the plug
Ain't no tellin' we do what we does
Every time that we fuck this shit up
Fuck this shit up, we came to fuck this shit up
