[Verse]
As you can see I like to eat away the competition
The way I'm cooking up the hits I shoulda bought
A kitchen see my name hold weight feel the
Repetition been poppin big shit while yall still pissin
Shoulda coulda woulda y'all niggas flugay
Put that bullshit away here's the ashtray I'ma push to the
End like its my last day I gotcha ho checking for me like
Survey these niggas still sleep they don't understand yet
Boy I'm about to takeoff free offset man I got these other
Rappers so upset she wanna browse like safari no internet
That's a mac book nigga I'ma mac look yall niggas stuck in
A box like a year book... I'm just preaching where the choir
Tho..this the shit that got Kanye through the wire tho
While I'm screaming good music I was blessed with a gift
I can't abuse it I been working on the floor like a
Cruise ship that money talk in LA I need a round trip
I'm just tryna see the finer things watch ya ho get
Pulled like a hamstring you sucka niggas out here
Falling for anything tell me how you sell ya soul
For a Lil fame I just watch and learn nigga I just
Watch and learn feel that pressure in ya chest like
A heartburn what I'm doing with my life is not your
Concern I just need my money smokey call me big worm
I been so patient nigga I been so patient tryna jump
Out the gym while y'all pump faking walk up in the
Strip club like bitch what's shaking like I really
Don't know she just want the faces she can get the
Faces baby I just want ya face I keep it covered
These hoes burning out here like some Mace I got this
Shit so tied up Ion need a lace I'm just aiming for
Success can I get a taste
