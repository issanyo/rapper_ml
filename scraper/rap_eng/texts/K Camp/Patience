One Thing I Can't Trust Is A Liar. I Swear, Im On Fire

You Can't Fuck With Me, Im On My Job, I Can't Get Fired
Came Up On Some Money, Now Im Flyer Than A Flyer
Told All Of My Niggas, We Gone Get It, Just Be Patient
Everyday Im Working. Man, I Need A Damn Vacation
Jumped Up Off The Benches, Now They Got Me In Rotation
I See That She With You, Now Thats My Girl, Boy, No Temptations
The Same Niggas That Told Me, That I Wasn't Gone Be Shit

Since Day One, I Saw The Vision, I Had A Spot At The Top
And Im Just Warming Up. This Shit Here, Won't Stop

I Swear, I Was Bless With Hella Patience. Look At All They Faces
I Smell Bullshit From A Mile Away. I Know They Hating
Its Been Plenty Years, That I Been Put In Situations
