Girl, you know that pussy so good. (You know that pussy so good)
Make a nigga like me wanna wife it, even though we gon’ one night it
By the look in yo’ eyes you like it. I know it’s there
Don’t hide it
Girl, I just want you to put it on me (Put it on me, put it on me.) (X4)
Girl I just want you to put it on me

[Verse]

Cause I’m gon put it on you. We can do it in the shower girl
We can do it up on the counter. I know your body ready
So I want it next to mine. I’m suckin on yo neck and
I’m kissing down your spine. No we ain’t done yet, she keep that wet
And I’m deeper than the ocean, grind on me, slow motion
She ready for that late night stroking. Baby I’ma bust it open, you
Know what’s between them legs. Damn that pussy so good, I might cuff
That, no feds
But I can’t, this a one night thang so we gotta make it last
She love when I pull her hair, she love when I smack that ass. Yeah
But I just want you to put it on me
Call me girl when you lonely, you say you ready, you gotta show me
