[Intro]
Never gonna love (?)
We came up girls
Never gonna love (?)

[Pre-Hook: Sry Ari Da Kid]
She got somebody, he not somebody
We goin', she rollin', she ain't even pop no molly
You hot like tamales
Come find, you come find me
We kick it, no karate
Oh yeah, yeah
Girl I'm your best move
I might correct you
I mean look who you next to, hey
Now throw it back like YesJulz
I say throw it back like YesJulz

[Hook: K Camp + (Sy Ari Da Kid)]
Need a bitch like Kehlani that's super tsunami
I'm papi, she mami
(I say throw it back like YesJulz)
On the run now, come find me
Let me get that punani, hey
(I say throw it back like YesJulz)

[Verse 1: K Camp]
Bless you, you gon' let a real nigga come to your rescue
Yes you, I'm already in, I'm movin' on the step too
Damn right, you say your last nigga ain't hittin' it right
Long overdue, you need some dick in your life
We could fuck around, have a party tonight
Girl let me bend your ass over on the weekend
We can XO like The Weeknd
Through the back door I can sneak in
I came over here for a reason
Big body Benz I'm creepin'
I'ma pull up, I'ma pull up
Just let me know if we fuckin' or what

[Hook: K Camp & (Sry Ari Da Kid)]
Need a bitch like Kehlani that's super tsunami
I'm papi, she mami
(I say throw it back like YesJulz)
On the run now, come find me
Let me get that punani, hey
(I say throw it back like YesJulz)
Need a bitch like Kehlani that's super tsunami
I'm papi, she mami
(I say throw it back like YesJulz)
On the run now, come find me
Let me get that punani, hey
(I say throw it back like YesJulz)

[Bridge: Sry Ari Da Kid]
YesJulz, YesJulz
I say throw it back like YesJulz
Need a bitch like Kehlani that's super tsunami
That's super tsunami
Throw it back like YesJulz
Throw it back like YesJulz
Throw it back like YesJulz

[Verse 2: K Camp + Sry Ari Da Kid]
Got her stuntin' on her ex right now
While I swerve in the Beamer
Yeah, silly words, don't need her
Got her sayin' fuck these niggas
She gon' need a third middle finger
I'm purchin'
Killin' niggas, I don't see 'em
Make it look too easy
Hunger for a plate, motherfucker I'm greedy, believe me
These niggas tame quicker than (?)
Judge give me a reason
We the ones that's eatin'
Make a quick move fuckin' at the Four Seasons
Claimin' you boss motherfucker, who you feedin'?
Me and Sy Ari in this bitch for a reason
We all eatin', walk in when y'all leavin'
Ignore beef
Hoes ain't (?) dog leashes
Ridin' with a Puerto Rican, equal
Prayin' for these fuck niggas, Lord Jesus

[Outro]
Yeah, Lord Jesus
Prayin' for these fuck niggas, Lord Jesus
Yeah, Lord Jesus
Prayin' for these fuck niggas, Lord Jesus
