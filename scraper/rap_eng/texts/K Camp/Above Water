[Verse 1: K Camp]
F is for forever
A is for ambition
M is the money that we sinning with
Just praying for forgiveness
E is for embrace
Cause the shit we live don't last forever
Understand this, boy became the man
If you didn't know, ho it's now or never
Floating through the clouds in a window seat
Trying to find my purpose
Money bring you problems
I'm dealing with these clowns like a fucking circus
These niggas reaching hard
You better chill before you foul out
This crazy shit that we call fame
Is really what these niggas steady dream about
I'ma tell you if it's worth it
Always watch your back
Cause they lurking
I remember them days I was hurting
I don't wanna go back to the hurting
Flashback to the days and the long nights
These niggas don't know what it feels like
I'm the same lil nigga from the Mill right
Turning up, just tryna see a mill right now

[Hook]
I keep my head above water
These niggas scared to hustle harder
But it's only right, said it's only right
I keep my head above water

[Verse 2: K Camp]
Don't treat me like I'm famous
Seem like now that I'm on, everybody acting different
Old friends ain't friends no more
So I just keep my distance
They too busy trying to count my pockets
Trying to wonder how I got it
Mind your fucking business
And I know I got the world looking at me
And I know these niggas gon' hate it
And I know every time that I make amove
I got to worry 'bout a lame ass critic
And I know they don't want to see me win
But you know, ho, I'm still going in
And you know, real talk, I'm the next nigga up
Got to know that it started in the Bend
All my life I been the underdog so I'm used to the bullshit
Used to a nigga sleeping on me, goodnight
And all my life I been the same nigga
Trying to run it up, trying to make a difference
Never traded on my niggas one time
So I'm good, right

[Hook]
I keep my head above water
These niggas scared to hustle harder
But it's only right, said it's only right
I keep my head above water

[Bridge]
Cause time don't wait on nobody
So I ain't waiting on nobody
Got to get everything I wanted
Cause this shit just last a moment
Oh how tables turn, oh how tables turn
Everything I got is everything I earned
Oh how niggas turn, oh how niggas turn
Watch them bridges burn, another lesson learned

[Outro]
Oh how tables turn, oh how tables turn
Everything I got is everything I earned
Oh how niggas turn, oh how niggas turn
Watch them bridges burn, another lesson learned
