[Hook 1]
Got a redbone , got a dark skin chick
One long haired, one short haired
Makes no difference
Might be skinny, Might be thick
She still my bitch
So many damn women, don't make no sense

[Bridge]
Cause I ain't got a type, no
Long as you grown, (long as you grown)
Long as you bad (long as you bad)
You got yo own
I ain't got a type, no
Just be a hunnid
Ain't with the drama
If you like it, I love it

[Verse 2: K Camp]
Got so many options, its hard to choose which one for me
Not really searching for no wifey
Just someone to keep it G
I ain't got no type
I just like just what I like
Ever since I started moving
Hoes been watching me like skype
Damn
Don't get the wrong idea
I am not the one thats gone straight from a chick
No
Not like your average nigga
My mind on the money
Not really on a bitch
So, can't really force no love on me
So, baby relax and let it flow
What's meant to be, gone happen
I'm not just rappin, just speakin facts
And its so, un-huh
You like them girls that hold you down, nigga
Un-huh
I'm talking ones that stick around
Un-huh
A bad bitch that shut it down, nigga
Un-huh
Just show me somethin
