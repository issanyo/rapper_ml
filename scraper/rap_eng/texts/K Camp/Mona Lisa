[Intro:]
Ah yeah, Ah yeah. (X4)

[Verse 1: Verse Simmonds]
Sex is the art baby tell me can I paint your body with love
Imagination runnin' wild when i'm thinkin' bout what im tryna do to ya girl
Im creative baby, won't do the same thing twice nah nah nah
Lady you could be my latest attraction
Come and get some of that long stroke

[Chorus: Verse Simmonds]
Welcome to the art show
Imma put it on slow
Gotta get it right
Baby you a mona one
You my favorite one
And the years to come
You'll still be perfection
(You'll be my mona Lisa)
They ain't nothin like you (nah)
They don't do it like you (nah)
Ain't another like you (nah)
They don't do it
(You'll be my mona Lisa)
They ain't nothin like you (nah)
They don't do it like you (nah)
Ain't another like you (nah)
They don't do it
They don't do it
'Cuz you're priceless
You're priceless
You're priceless
You're priceless

[Verse 2: K Camp]
Look, girl I can't get enough of your thing
I know that it's priceless
No matter how long we've been in this ring
I just know you can't fight it
I just wanna put you on the wall near the end cuz I know it's mine
I ain't really good with attitudes, once you're light cup full, hurry up we ain't got much time
She bust it like a down columbine
Long black hair look just like Mulan
You looking at a star baby girl let's shine
I put you in the game, take you out the sidelines
Yeah, I draw this shit like Picasso
She going ride like a top ho
My life just like a booth baby these bitches just wanna cameo?
Paint the picture, Michelangelo
I can't stand no messy ho
But if yo man actin up, girl I don't mind you can come get some of that love show

[Chorus: Verse Simmonds]
Welcome to the art show
Imma put it on slow
Gotta get it right
Baby you a mona one
You my favorite one
And the years to come you'll still be perfection
(You'll be my mona Lisa)
They ain't nothin like you (nah)
They don't do it like you (nah)
Ain't another like you (nah)
They don't do it
(You'll be my mona Lisa)
They ain't nothin like you (nah)
They don't do it like you (nah)
Ain't another like you (nah)
They don't do it
They don't do it
