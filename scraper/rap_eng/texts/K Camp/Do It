[Hook: K Camp]
We can start off on this floor
End up on that bed
You rubbin' through my head
While I’m all between yo legs
I'mma hit it from the front, back, side, side
Girl I love the way you
Do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it
Girl I love the way you do it

[Verse 1: Mykko Montana]
Lil shawty so damn bad
Her shoes matchin' her bag
Her nails matchin' her feet
Lil shawty sho unique
She rubbin' on my back
I’m rubbin' on her thighs
Her tongue off in my ear
I'mma take it up to first gear
Now we don’t like that freaky shit
But tonight I might just will
Cut the radio off
I’m bumpin' that Johnny Gill
She said Mykko you nasty
I said no I’m just real
She started playin her role
This shit just got too real
I tied up my dreads
Then fell off in her legs
She slowed me down then sat me down
Then started givin' me head
No personally I don’t know this bitch
But I’m diggin' all her ways
She 5'2" and I’m 6'4"
I’m goin in MJ
I bend hER over she threw it back
I'm grippin' on her waist
She turnt up, yeah that cool but I ain't tryin' catch no case (shut up)
We was in the bed now we on the floor kicking everything out the way (well damn)
Too many cameras and this bitch got a showin' down OK (right now)
She said open my sex drive can last all damn day (for real)
I write down do you take a break this shit we doing ain't safe
(I'm tired)
We been going in for a couple hours I like the way you taste
(and ummm)
Big old ass lil' slim waist she fine as hell in the face

Girl I love the way you
Do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it
Girl I love the way you do it

[Verse 2: Mykko Montana]
When I hit the club I’m coolin'
A bad bitch I’m persuin'
She in park but her ass be movin'
Too turnt up and I can’t stop groovin'
One look at it and she can’t stop lookin'
Girl Scout swag, she ain’t sellin' cookies
Dancin' on the pole, she playin' with that pussy
Don’t shoot me down baby girl I’m like cupid
So she slowly came off that pole
And told me something I should know
The music loud she was talkin' low I couldn’t understand this ho
So I told shawty go change clothes and meet me back right here
Don’t say a word just grab your bag so we can disappear
She said bet and I said cool
Later on we was at The Twelve
She don’t drink lean but she smoke loud
So we burned down a whole L
See you the type I might take home and let you spend the night
But I don’t know yet
It's our first date
Let me think about it aight!
So we in the whip on 75 trynna figure out the move
She said aye and I said what
She gone ask me what we gone do
Come lay ya head on my lap and do somethin' you barely don’t do
She said bet then she got loose and blew the top off of that coupe (shit)
