[Hook]
Feel like you owe me that pussy
Owe me that pussy, owe me that pussy
Feel like you owe me that pussy
Owe me that pussy, owe me that pussy
Girl don't try to play with that pussy
Play with that pussy, play with that pussy
Feel like you owe me that pussy
Owe me that pussy, owe me that pussy
Feel like you owe me that pussy
Girl don't try to hide that pussy
I'm just tryin' to provide for that pussy
Let me take a little ride with that pussy

[Verse 1]
I feel like I know what you're feelin'
Waitin' for me to get in it
All of them times that you played with that pussy
I'm all on your legs like some linen
Hold up this just the beginnin'
Seem like we're both out here sinnin'
Just throw it at me, I'm hittin' home runs
Let's act like we're in the 9th innin'
I don't wanna play no more games with you
I just wanna put this thing on you
The way that you act got you cuffin' that cat
Maybe you can teach me a thing or two
Don't need no flag, I'ma bang with you
Fuck around and get in that ring with you
Bone, bone
I'm just doin' what I came to do

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Girl it's too late, you can't hide it
Let's go to war with no violence
I can tell right now you gon' need a pillow
Cause damn, girl, you just can't keep quiet
She love it when I sing so melodic
I swear that pussy exotic
Stop all that playin'
Let me just get a lil' taste, please let me try it
Give me one hit, I'ma knock it out the park
Plenty fish in the sea and I'm actin' like a shark
I'm a dog with this shit so a nigga might bark
Got the pussy on flood, might need Noah's Ark
Ye ain't hittin' that right if the pussy don't fart
Ye ain't hittin' that right if the pussy don't fart

[Hook]
