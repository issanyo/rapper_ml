[Hook: Ya Boy The Truth]

Bitch you know we winnin', money we be spendin'
I know that new foreign got them niggas and they feelings
He say that's his main ho, but I be drillin'
We got them Glock's with extending clips and we ain't never slippin'

[Verse 1: Young Lyxx]

I know that ain't your hoe 'cause why she here with me
I turn up where I go while you turn down tv's
And I be on the road get the pilot's for my shows
Put Versace on my O's, put wasabi on my flows
Cause I'm hot, I am everything you not
I am real I imply
They ain't seen this shit since Pac
Seen me in the foreign drop
I be swingin' down your block
Middle fingers to the cops
Haters praying that I stop
Blowing up my line like hoe what the fuck you want
Real niggas fuck with me and I don't give a fuck who don't
I rather chase the money while you rather chase the women
So don't get mad when I got cash you and you sour like lemons

[Hook]

[Verse 2: K-Camp]

Look, Shout out to my nigga Lyxx he kick that shit
I been workin' hard I'm talkin' graveyard shifts
Tell your bitch behave she know I'm gettin' throwed
I just counted fifty, that was yesterday
Get that ho some water man she extra thirsty
She won't let it go just like a Kobe jersey
Tell that ho to meet me at 11:30
You can step inside trying to find out is you worth it
Okay take a sip of the Henn' then I kill it
Man let's go back like an old Cadillac on fours just chillin' on the village
Pa-pa told me keep spinnin'
Gotta know you dealin' with a villain
In the middle of the field making clutch-ass plays
Hit the stats little bitch we winnin'

[Hook]
