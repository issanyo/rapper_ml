[Verse 1]
Look
What's her name ?
I musta forgot
Too many cities
Too many bottles
Too many thots
Too many problems
Not enough answers
Shawty she ah school girl
But at night she ah dancer
You should know
She gon work
She fell in love with the life
The money first
She gon play
With your heart
She make it worst
I salute the things you do to make it work

[Chorus]
Gon get it
My shawty ain't scared
My shawty ain't scared
My shawty ain't scared (nah,nah)
I see you working
Gon get it
My shawty ain't scared
My shawty ain't scared
My shawty ain't scared (nah,nah)

[Verse 2]
1 a.m
Pulled up to the house
Shot that text
You know what's next
We all on the couch
I'm her choice
You can have it after
I know you ain't perfect
But tonight it don't matter
I see the truth
I see the hurt
I see the love
I see the pain
In your eyes
But I'll admit I'll take the blame
But lets be real
I want your love don't act surprised

[Chorus]
Gon get it
My shawty ain't scared
My shawty ain't scared
My shawty ain't scared (nah,nah)
I see you working
Gon get it
My shawty ain't scared
My shawty ain't scared
My shawty ain't scared (nah,nah)

[Outro]
Aight, what should I say about this motherfucka?
He tryna slick play like, we tryna fuck but
I don't know
I mean, I'm not tripping because I want the same thing
However, I don't know I think Imma make him wait, hmm
I know I can't wait too long
However, I just, I don't know
I'm not ready
I don't wanna him to have it too easy
What do you think?
What should you I do?
I might've been gave it up by now girl
