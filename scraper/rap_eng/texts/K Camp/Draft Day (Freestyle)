[Verse 1]
I heard it's draft day
I'm just waitin' for my callin'
Your bitch done bounced on more wood, than a fuckin' spalding, ball
Ah man, I'm doing what I predicted
My nigga's, they been down since day one, on my side like kidneys
If you with that goofy shit, just take a trip to Disney
Ain't fucked my side bitch in bout two weeks, ho, I know she miss me
I feel I'm sinin' every night, I stayed too throwed like Frisbee
I'm chasin' grands, you see the hustle, I just need a [?]
Some of ya'll ain't gonna get it though
My bitch asks me who I love, I said the studio
I cannot remain faithful, all these groupie ho's
Bitch you know I'm with these slums, I need a group of those
[?]
She just keep that good brain, medulla oblongata
Only thing poppin' over there is your collar
I hope my next bitch, down to ride like Impalla's
Listen, I don't owe you nigga's shit
And all you Internet gangsters, ya'll can suck a dick
I see you hatin' on a nigga cause I'm gettin' rich
Sorry baby, members only ask my nigga Rich
My nigga Boat keep me smokin' good
Smokin' doobies with your bitch, let get that understood
My Texas nigga's keep that ore like they in the hood
Get it, Keep that ore like they in the hood
I remember them days I was fightin' just to get it
Now a nigga out west, cool in [?]
I know they hate it, but shit, I cannot help it
I got, rid of those snakes in the grass
You know, the helpless
You know, I keep the hooks and the flows
I know you hear it, I know
They hate the fact that I'm fly
Somethin' like [?]
They try to keep me yo from Interscope to Warner Brothers
Told that bitch if she goin' suck it, when I nut she warn a brother (Yikes)
OK, that Forbes is my motivation
I like that money talkin' to me, that's good conversation
Facts
Now I can rip this beat all day, but I just did it for my fans
Now mention me, tell me I'm great, oh
[?] Turn a ho, so lord
Ha

[Outro]
Y'all already know what time it is me K Camp
[?] to everybody fuckin' with my campaign
If you don't fuck with my campaign, I don't fuck with you, simple as that
Your bitch love me, I can't help that either
They gonna hate on this shit too though
I couldn't care less, I'm killin' shit
