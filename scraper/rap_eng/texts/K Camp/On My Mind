[Intro: O.T. Genasis, DJ Drama]
Dedicated
Yeah
It's KP
I know it get hard sometimes
Team black, free the homies
Real life, this'll be the realest shit I ever wrote
I mean, shit be good, but you'd be surprised what a nigga go through

[Hook: K Camp]
What's on your mind?
Tryna figure out how I'm gon' get it, man
I swear that's on my mind, yeah
Out here tryna live and keep my family straight
I swear that's on my mind, yeah
These niggas out here wanna see me fail
Gotta get em' off my mind, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
What's on your mind?

[Verse 1: O.T. Genasis]
Big pieces to stunt on all the sleeper's
Drinkin' 'way all my pain, double cup like a Reese's
Money what I'm makin', niggas still hatin'
Swear the jitta trip, but not a vacation
My cousin said I'mma blow up, he knew that I would shine
But he ain't get to see it, RIP my nigga died
Got a family to feed, my son autistic
So fuck a nigga if he think I ain't authentic
Mental problems, baggin' dishes, so was no detention
Just work with him every day, early intervision
See Black doin' time, Pete doin' time
So I'm here rappin', I don't know what the fuck gon' happen

[Hook: K Camp]
What's on your mind?
Tryna figure out how I'm gon' get it, man
I swear that's on my mind, yeah
Out here tryna live and keep my family straight
I swear that's on my mind, yeah
These niggas out here wanna see me fail
Gotta get em' off my mind, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
What's on your mind?

[Verse 2: O.T. Genasis]
Me and my niggas ride with choppa's like we in the army
My baby brother got a choppa cuz he in the army
So if a nigga make me nervous, I gotta destroy
And this shit make me nervous, he 'bout to deploy
Slowin' down my hustle just so I don't go to prison
And my momma just recovered from that aneurysm
Caught a stroke, lost for words, cuz she lost her words
Couldn't say shit, swear it made me fuckin' sick
Pray to God that he give her another chance
Still can't forget how she looked in that ambulance
I know that I'mma be ight, God got a plan
So fuck a nigga or a bitch who don't understand

[Hook: K Camp]
What's on your mind?
Tryna figure out how I'm gon' get it, man
I swear that's on my mind, yeah
Out here tryna live and keep my family straight
I swear that's on my mind, yeah
These niggas out here wanna see me fail
Gotta get em' off my mind, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
What's on your mind?

[Verse 3: K Camp]
These lame niggas stay hatin', and I don't know why
Almost two years you been gone, I swear time fly
These niggas don't know, I swear these niggas don't know
I took a dream and I ran with it, watch how far I go
Niggas talkin' bout such and such, I swear, I ain't got time for it
Catch me on a island, smokin' good and some concords
Momma's crib is paid for, every night what I pray for
Sacrifice every day for her, this the shit that I'm made for

[Hook: K Camp]
What's on your mind?
Tryna figure out how I'm gon' get it, man
I swear that's on my mind, yeah
Out here tryna live and keep my family straight
I swear that's on my mind, yeah
These niggas out here wanna see me fail
Gotta get em' off my mind, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
What's on your mind?
