[Verse 1: Derez De'Shon]
It's-it's-it's-it's D-Dash (squad)
I need a healthy free bag (brr)
Diamonds playing freeze tag (brr)
Pussy nigga I bleed swag (squa)
Shout to Reese, I don't fuck with niggas, I'm 300
They ask where I been at? bitch I been getting money

[Chorus: Sy Ari Da Kid]
I said 300 niggas, 300 G's
Promoters can't stand us, we show up 300 deep
I say it 300 times, we what the streets wanna see
Feel like 300 Spartans, stomping with 600 feet

[Post-Chorus: Sy Ari Da Kid]
Squad up! squad, squad
Squad up! squad, squad
Squad up! squad, squad
Squad up! squad, squad

[Verse 2: Sy Ari Da Kid]
Yeah
3-3-300 spartans, leading and marching
Swimming in women, I'm sleeping with dolphins, nah
Pay me no need for the bargain
Laughing at broke niggas leasing apartments
People are talking, saying I'm tripping
I murder him, kill him, then pee on his coffin
Barking, Sy Ari  fuck 'em then leave 'em
They treat him like he Mr. Marcus

[Verse 3: Translee]
Mafio, Ma-Mafio, no patience for sloppy hoes
Translee checking in, checking in like the lobby floor
I sign by the X, and get them O's, tha-that's a kiss
People that just don't give a fuck
Tha-tha-tha-that's my niche, woo

[Verse 4: Verse Simmonds]
My niggas rolling 'round with a fully automatic illmatic, goddamn it
If your bitch get it up then you know she gotta have it
I'm on every type of drug, if you know what I mean
If you cross that line, we gon' make that sing
Too much money to be getting for you to be hating on me, that's a bitch trait
I'm too real, you too fake, I got two guns for that toothache

[Verse 5: Que]
My squad full of young niggas
Drug dealers, Thunder Cats
Chopper punk a nigga like Ashton Kutcher
Make a nigga dip like a running back
Pop up on you like a instant message
Clapping shit, no jumping jacks
My niggas like me, I done made this shit clear
You front me a pack, I ain't coming back (Que)

[Chorus: Sy Ari Da Kid]
I said 300 niggas, 300 G's
Promoters can't stand us, we show up 300 deep
I say it 300 times, we what the streets wanna see
Feel like 300 Spartans, stomping with 600 feet

[Post-Chorus: Sy Ari Da Kid]
Squad up! squad, squad
Squad up! squad, squad
Squad up! squad, squad
Squad up! squad, squad

[Verse 6: K Camp]
Dirt Gang niggas yell squad
K Camp screaming link up
300 niggas, that's 300 motherfuckers
Trying to get it in by the trucks
I'm a hot young nigga that'll take your bitch
Too fly, I can land on a cloud
Money on me, your ho on me now
Too turnt and I can't turn down, wassup

[Verse 7: Stuey Rock]
See I got 300 niggas, that mean it's 600 pistols
And if you run up, start talking shit, we gon' let them things hit you, naw
Ain't gotta be no issue, them things gon' let loose
Them bullets get to barking and biting, pitbulls gon' get you

[Verse 8: Tha Joker]
I wet you like a pan handle
My whole city they 'bout the action
I light you up, LA Gears
I'm going in like close contractions
Get the picture, emoji
I rap but I had that sack first
Pussy nigga don't play with me
I am live spelled backwards

[Verse 9: Jose Guapo]
If a nigga want his issue, he can get it quick
Know my niggas got them choppers, they pull up with them sticks
And his bitch, it's lit, now we going hard
I'll fuck your broad, Guapo fucking with the squad

[Chorus: Sy Ari Da Kid]
I said 300 niggas, 300 G's
Promoters can't stand us, we show up 300 deep
I say it 300 times, we what the streets wanna see
Feel like 300 Spartans, stomping with 600 feet

[Post-Chorus: Sy Ari Da Kid]
Squad up! squad, squad
Squad up! squad, squad
Squad up! squad, squad
Squad up! squad, squad

[Verse 10: Chaz Gotti]
Dead guys in my pockets, got me dead man walking
Catch me in the club nigga, ain't no talking
I'm swagging with no rhythm, but I'm money walking
Chaz Gotti, I'ma finish what Slim Dunkin started

[Verse 11: BoDeal]
Look, Killer Clan, Brick Squad, everybody know me (Bo)
I be scrapping niggas lowkey (Bo), it's that Chi hitter Bo D
If you want beef I got that, these niggas with me OC
If I nod, they popping that heat
But they don't really need it, cold D, Bo

[Verse 12: Bambino Gold]
Ran through 300 packs (money), in 300 minutes
Bambino got a sack, and I love to spend it
I'm my own boss, capo, and lieutenant
Great product, trap star, bitch I'm winnin'

[Verse 13: Dae Dae]
I'm squading up (squad), y'all niggas' time is up (turn up)
Stevie Wonder with that chopper, bitch I'm blind as fuck
Put them lighters in the air, one time for Dunk (Pedro)
DG got them applications, sign 'em up

[Verse 14: Doe Boy]
300 niggas, that's 300 triggers
Y'all got 300 niggas, but y'all got like zero killers
We pull up with them pistols, my niggas shoot, they won't miss him
Disrespect, we gon' kill him (you think I'm playing?)
Pop a bean and forget him

[Post-Chorus: Sy Ari Da Kid]
Squad up! squad, squad
Squad up! squad, squad
Squad up! squad, squad
Squad up! squad, squad

[Verse 15: Scotty ATL]
I took 'bout 300 dollars, built this shit from the ground
Took 'bout 300 days, I'm trying to turn up my town
Nigga be cool, but you don't want problems
I ain't say a word but these ho's gon' flock
New A-Town, and my nigga James, shit real
Don't believe me, just watch

[Verse 16: Issa]
Okay it's FYB, pulled up 300 deep
And she say she vegan, but she could still get the meat
Don't fuck with industry niggas, I fuck with in the street niggas
And I need me a shrink, I'm fucked up mentally nigga

[Verse 17: John John Da Don]
300 niggas, we 300 deep
We cut from the same cloth, so it's like 300 mes
Homie say he don't believe, I guess he wanna see
That's backwards, 'cause he's a vegetable if he wanna beef

[Verse 18: FlyGuyVeto]
I said them bitch niggas be hiding, but real niggas move in silence
Got 300 killers, 300 pistols, better know my niggas be wildin'
And every one around me solid, no flawed niggas in my circle
Stay true is the code we follow, only move if it's 'bout them dollars

[Chorus: Sy Ari Da Kid]
I said 300 niggas, 300 G's
Promoters can't stand us, we show up 300 deep
I say it 300 times, we what the streets wanna see
Feel like 300 Spartans, stomping with 600 feet

[Post-Chorus: Sy Ari Da Kid]
Squad up! squad, squad
Squad up! squad, squad
Squad up! squad, squad
Squad up! squad, squad

[Verse 19: Offset]
No solider but I got troops
A whole bunch goons on the roof, they gon' shoot
Cut the top off the head, just like a coupe
What you wanna do? we can fight, we can shoot
Shit get nasty, wrap 'em in the plastic
Throw him in the trash, now the nigga looking trashy
Whole clique full of shooters, just like the Mavericks
We don't give a fuck, put a nigga in the casket

[Verse 20: Quavo]
Extendo longer than a ruler, all my niggas, they shooters
Place your order in Bermuda, I got more keys than a computer
Don't move wrong, he might shoot ya, my team ballin' like Buddha
31 in the clip, Reggie Miller, put you in the lake, no timber

[Verse 21: Takeoff]
300 like Chief Keef, squad up if you want beef
I'ma tell you like the OG told me
Migo plugged, stay strapped in the street
When I go to war like Spartans, hit 'em with the carbon
And I keep the strap like Marvin the Martian
Gas and the Glock in the glove compartment
Free Westside, 'til then fuck the sergeant

[Verse 22: Tabius Tate]
Okay I'm 300, million
One more shot, free Meech nigga
Rap game in a chokehold like, go to sleep nigga
Started from the bottom, now we here motherfucker
We some real motherfuckers, and I be hood Dre
I'm Tabius Tate, I'm like Will Smith
I'm a fresh price, and I fill banks

[Verse 23: Zuse]
(Look, look)
Four-fours and big Glocks, kush, coke, and ziplocs
Young God gon' drip drop, and big rocks, see the big watch
Dope time, nigga tick tock, flip flop, get a big shot
Dumb nigga got a waiver, flexin' like a big shot

[Verse 24: Kidd Kidd]
G-Unit all on my back nigga, I move weight like a fat nigga
N O may Zan nigga, throw my set up like bad dinner
Ask yo ho, I'm that nigga, Kidd Kidd kidnap niggas
Get your family bowtie'd and gift wrap with ya, Merry Christmas

[Verse 25: Nyemiah]
I don't fall in line, I lead it, heads up, I'm so conceited
I ain't never seen a dude that I needed
Say shit once, and I don't repeat it
Sweden in that BM, ten stars, they can't see in
But it ain't no creepin', don't be sleepin'
Supremacy 300, knee deep in

[Verse 26: Jacquees]
Young east side nigga Jacquees
In the coupe, probably doing top speed
Got your girl then she probably on her knees
She twenty-five, but I'm only nineteen
Get down, get down, this young nigga bout to blow
I can earn my stripes, so that they already know

[Verse 27: Jace]
Chopper make it sound like Compton
Potato on the tip like condoms
Calculator clip, they don't want no problem
Four five just like a pill, might pop 'em, uh
Youngins that'll shoot you for a hoodie
Call the camera man just to get the footage
Whole crew gon' mob and I don't mean Goodie
Hit him in the head and he gon' need goodies, nigga

[Outro: Flex Knox]
Ohhh, yes yes
You just experienced wrath of the titans, monsters unite
And it went down heavy, heavy, heavy, rah
(Squad up)
