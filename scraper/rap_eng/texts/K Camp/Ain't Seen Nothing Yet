[Hook: K Camp]
Pull up on your block got them saying what's next
Playing no games going to sing for the check
Bitch you know my name switch lanes I'm set
Nigga stop playing you ain't seen nothing yet
Ain't seen nothing yet
Playing no games going to sing for the check
Ain't seen nothing yet
Playing no games going to sing for the check

[Verse 1: Problem]
If you saying that's real then you better be
A broke nigga I ain't gon' ever be
I'm a cash box seven different stash spots
Throw a band watch Rollie make her ass pop
Like who the nigga I am
Made it five all the way to the I-10
Take a shot throw your hood up
Every way baby its the bar when I pull up
[?]
Hundreds and fifties no Jacksons
Blowing on that loud what is you saying
Twelve men in with me deep bitch I ain't playing

[Hook]

[Verse 2: K Camp]
Grade A huh terrific
Broke boy talking money smaller than a midget
Me and problem causing problems so you lame niggas feel it
Acting in this bitch we got it jumping like some crickets
Running around the city all the bad bitches with it
Pussy know I'm killing you just scared to admit it
Chilling with my niggas getting blunted fuck the other side
Nigga fuck the other side
Show them how a nigga ride
Playing with the pussy girl you can't hide
Hear this bitch get fucked up
Playing with the money boy you fucked up

[Hook](x2)
