[Hook]
Just take a hit of this, it'll get you right
Don't worry bout nothin', turn up the night
U want more in your life but you can't get right
Don't worry bout nothin', just turn up the night
Turn up the night (x16)

[Verse 1]
Look, girl, let loose cause I know just what you like
It's all on you if you wanna turn up the night
So many blunts that my mind somewhere in space
Push pause on a ho cause she won't stay out my face
I ain't worried bout nothin', I ain't worried bout nothin'
I just came here to have a good time
Yeah, that drank in me and that smoke in me
Yeah, I'm turnt in this bitch, no lie
All that ass on her, can't pass on her
I'mma steal yo' bitch, no crime
I'mma get to the money, I'mma shine til the end
Get back, don't worry bout mine

[Bridge]
Drinks in the air and I came wit' my crew
No, we don't care, we gon' turn up on you
Haters, they gone stare, tell 'em watch what we do
Turn up, yeah, I know you feel somethin'
To be real, I ain't worried bout nothin'

[Hook]
Just take a hit of this, it'll get you right
Don't worry bout nothin', turn up the night
U want more in your life but you can't get right
Don't worry bout nothin', just turn up the night
Turn up the night (x16)

[Verse 2]

[Bridge]
Drinks in the air and I came wit' my crew
