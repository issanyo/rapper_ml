[Verse 1]
When you wake  up in the morning
I see it in your eyes that you know it
These niggas sleeping on you
These niggas sleeping on you
When you look at yourself in the mirror
I know it don't get much clearer
That these niggas sleeping on you
These niggas sleeping on you
Chillin at the house with your boy shorts on
With that ass hanging out, can't do nun wrong
All in the kitchen, whippin the chicken
Twerk while you cook, let me grab my phone
Let me record you, letting you know I adore you
The broke niggas they can't afford you
Most of them niggas they boring you
And I know
She be missing the kid when I'm on the road
Told her the game and that's just how it go
My shawtys so underrated
And still them other bitches hate it

She ain't never count a niggas pockets
She ain't never count a niggas pockets
Cause she know when I got it, she got it

When she hit the club them hoes land on her
I can't help but to drop them bands on her
Every nigga want a chance on her
You can't get her, cause the man on her

But I know she don't below to the kid
But for the moment lil shawty let's live
But make sure you tell them hoes to mind they own biz
