[Intro]
K.Wayy
Let's go

[Chorus]
I can't fuck with you like I want to
You got too much going on
And I can't give my love to you
If I do, that would be crazy
Crazy, crazy, crazy, crazy, crazzzy

[Verse 1]
Ayy shawty let me tell you what time it is
These hoes for everybody
But that ain't the point
I'ma tell you what really do mater
Bitch you wasn't stunting me when I was broke
Now you is 'cause a young nigga pockets got fafter
Oh you know so and so I'm flattered
Little bitch I done caught on ya patterns
Upgraded now my new bitch badder
Now pick up the phone baby
Let me know if you alone baby
Plenty niggas tried to clone baby
You been getting it on your own baby
Make a nigga wanna fall for that
But I know I gotta fall back
When I call you, you better call back
What am I to do with all of that
I don't know who I'm dealing with
Shawty tell me what ya mission is
Is your motive really genuine
Or is you fucking for the Benjamins
Most these hoes want a piece of me
Take the whip and grab the keys for me
Shawty think this shit is easy see
But I would never go out easily
So

[Chorus]
I can't fuck with you like I want to
You got too much going on
And I can't give my love to you
If I do, that would be crazy
Crazy, crazy, crazy, crazy, crazzzy

[Hook]
I won't make the same mistakes
I won't make the same mistakes
I won't make the same mistakes
I won't make the same mistakes
I might take your heart to break
Try my hardest to be patient
I might take your heart to break it
Do you want it or you faking

[Verse 2]
Shawty be real to me
I got niggas that will kill for me
I got bitches that would steal for me
Ride or die and grab the steel for me
Told lil shawty don't get comfortable
I got women trying take ya place
Gotta show me you ahead of the race
Fuck me good and put some eggs on my plate
Fuck me good and tell me what I wanna hear
Baby let's get up out of here
I know you know game by now
Made it my duty to figure you out
Girl you so cold and I'm digging ya style
Just wanna fuck on your body right now
But I can't risk falling in love with you
That is my problem I'm telling you now

[Chorus]
I can't fuck with you like I want to
You got too much going on
And I can't give my love to you
If I do, that would be crazy
Crazy, crazy, crazy, crazy, crazzzy

[Outro]
I love K.wayy
