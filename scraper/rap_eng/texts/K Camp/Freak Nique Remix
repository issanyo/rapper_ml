[Verse 1]
Girl name Tyesha, work at Follies where she play
She just want a check like she work for Sallie Mae
All these niggas tricking, I take her to J.R. Crickets
Then we hit the spot like 10-piece, lemon pepper sprinkles
She a trap queen, she like to fuck to Jeezy
She a trap queen, she like to fuck to Jeezy
She gon' get that money buy them brand new Yeezys
Pop it for me shawty, you gon' get them Yeezys
Beamer, Bentley, Benz, or that Rover
Got her own car, she just wanna bust it open
She her own star, made a movie on the sofa
Cause she been a bad girl so I'mma beat like she stole it

[Hook]
We gon' take your bitch like it's '96
We gon' fuck your bitch like it's '96

That's my lil woe, I call her Freak Nique
That's my lil woe, I call her Freak Nique

We gon' take your bitch like it's '96
We gon' fuck your bitch like it's '96
We gon' snatch your bitch like it's '96
We gon' fuck your bitch like it's '96
