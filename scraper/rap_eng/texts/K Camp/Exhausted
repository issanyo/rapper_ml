[Chorus]
I told shawty this the last time (last time)
But I said that shit the last time

Girl I want you all to myself
I can put them bands in your pocket
Let me turn you to a trending topic

[Verse 1]
We gone fuck 'til we worn out
She want me 'cause I'm on now
She ain't fucking with the norm now
Magic City, let it storm now
And you knowwww
We did that shit the last time (last time)
She shot me down like a sniper
Baby let's jump in the Viper
I let her spit like a cypher
Jump on the dick donâ€™t be hyper
Turn my lil bae to a fighter
When I'm on road I might Skype ya
When I'm on road I might swipe ya
You know I had to one night ya

All you wanna do with me is fuck and argue
Tried my best to let you go but it's so hard to
She say he ain't home so know I'm gon' fall through
I ain't worried 'bout him 'cause I got ya heart too
She say jump inside of me
Fuck me good and lie to me
Your man don't apply to me
Stop that talk, just ride on me
You knowwww we ain't s'posed to be doing this and this

[Chorus]
