[Hook: Zoey Dollaz]
I could call all my Cubans, I could call all my Haitians
I could call my Jamaicans, my young niggas got no patience
All my niggas with the shit, all my niggas with the shit
All my niggas with the shit, all my niggas with the shit

[Hook: Zoey Dollaz]
I could call all my Cubans, I could call all my Haitians
I could call my Jamaicans, my young niggas got no patience
All my niggas with the shit, all my niggas with the shit
All my niggas with the shit, all my niggas with the shit

[Verse 1: Zoey Dollaz]
All my niggas with the shit
They catch you slippin', nigga you get hit
They runnin' around with sticks
Fuck around you gon' get flipped
You know I'm running with my Zoes
You know them niggas is on go
I just gotta make the call
Bow-bow-bow, your casket closed
I could call my Jamaicans
My young niggas got no patience
Fuck you fuck niggas hating
Just know bullets burn like the satan
I could call all my chicos
I murder one like a free throw
I just gotta make the dial
They'll pull up, kill you right now

[Hook: Zoey Dollaz]
I could call all my Cubans, I could call all my Haitians
I could call my Jamaicans, my young niggas got no patience
All my niggas with the shit, all my niggas with the shit
All my niggas with the shit, all my niggas with the shit

[Hook: Zoey Dollaz]
I could call all my Cubans, I could call all my Haitians
I could call my Jamaicans, my young niggas got no patience
All my niggas with the shit, all my niggas with the shit
All my niggas with the shit, all my niggas with the shit

[Verse 2: K Camp]
Please don't ever get it twisted
Money making wisdom, bitch you know I get it
All my niggas' fingers twisted
Well if you insist it I'ma let 'em risk it
Me and Zoey Dollaz tryna stack them dollars
I just bought her some new Prada
Straight from the north, I'm a scholar
Shawty perfume is all in the collar
In Miami with them Zoes
In the H with the mob
I'm connected everywhere
Niggas fuckin' count from Baltimore to Car
Niggas claiming that they street niggas and they sellin' packs of the drugs
But we all know you a scrub
And try if you want, ain't no hoe in my blood

[Hook: Zoey Dollaz]
I could call all my Cubans, I could call all my Haitians
I could call my Jamaicans, my young niggas got no patience
All my niggas with the shit, all my niggas with the shit
All my niggas with the shit, all my niggas with the shit

[Hook: Zoey Dollaz]
I could call all my Cubans, I could call all my Haitians
I could call my Jamaicans, my young niggas got no patience
All my niggas with the shit, all my niggas with the shit
All my niggas with the shit, all my niggas with the shit
