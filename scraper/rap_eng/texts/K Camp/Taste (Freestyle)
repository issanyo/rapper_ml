Kodak free, tell that nigga holla at me
They say I'm the one, like they threw a dollar at me
Good dick and Louie V'll probably make her happy
Shawty blowin' up my phone, sorry bitch I'm not the papi
Everywhere I go you know it's on me, strappy
Shawty got a ass, told her sit it on my lappy
Love & Hip Hop, baby naw this ain't Scrappy
Hundred-K on me, this is why my jeans sagging
Pussy good, please don't make me wait, Shaggy
Ass shots finally wearing off, saggy
Cut the bitch off, let her go, don't nag me
Shawty spreadin' lies on me cause she can't have me
I got niggas countin' on me, you can't count me out
You ever seen a half a mil, watch me count it out
Internet gangstas, fuck what they talkin' bout
How the fuck you hating and you tweetin' from yo momma couch
Yup, hottest in Atlanta, uh big dog
You niggas some clowns, uh Jigsaw
Caught a Glock, Dion Sanders get you picked off
Her pussy smell like fish sticks, now my dick soft
Shout out Drake, shout out Ye, shout out Rick Ross
How the fuck is you gon win if you ain't took a loss?
Got a bitch that like a bitch, and they both mine
The only nigga here in the city with no co-sign
Niggas tryna ride my wave, I'm on the coast line
When I step up on that stage, you know it's show time
I can't choose between the two because y'all both fine
Niggas hating but I been the GOAT the whole time
Forth and inches goin' for it on the goal line
Since you still on my nuts, well you can hold mine
Rollie flooded on my wrist, that's a gold mine
I already wiped the bullets, let me load mine
Why they only blog when you on that clown shit?
All these bitches mad cause I got a down bitch
Block me, unfollow me, that's the same thing
But you part of my collection baby, bang-bang
Yeah yeah, free my niggas in the chain gang
Yeah yeah, man I hate how they did Wayne
Yeah yeah, this the new school dedication
Big white-t's, rap CD in the basement
Whack niggas tryin' hard, but you can't replace me
I done smoked a whole ounce, now I'm levitating
Just popped a half, you can say I'm medicating
Appreciate the fans, I can see y'all stayed patient
