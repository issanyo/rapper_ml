[Intro: Yung Bleu]
Hoop dreams, hoop dreams
Hoop dreams

[Chorus: Yung Bleu]
I used to have hoop dreams, just like LeBron
But now I'm in a six speed, I'm on the run
I swear I had this, world in my hand when I was young
I swear I had the, world in my hand when I was young
I want to be like Dwyane Wade
I want to be like LeBron James, ayy
I had hoop dreams like Steph, ayy
I'm in a drug house with the meth
Feds tryna charge me a with a theft
All my dreams they done went to the left
I had hoop dreams nigga, I had hoop dreams nigga
Yeah, I had hoop dreams nigga, ayy
Yeah, I had hoop dreams nigga, yeah, I had hoop dreams nigga
Yeah, I had hoop dreams nigga

[Verse 1: Yung Bleu]
School gym, playin' one on one
School fight, ain't no one on one
We used to rob niggas just for the fun
That basketball, turned to a gun
My lil nigga, that my lil nigga, he on the run
Three thousand dollars just to make the bond
Back in middle school I used to play the drums
Now it's high school, fifty rounds in the drum, huh
All my hoop dreams out the door, I'm foolish rum
The police kicked the door, run Forrest run
You know I had the odds stacked against me
Ain't even have faith in God, God forgive me

[Chorus: Yung Bleu]
I used to have hoop dreams, just like LeBron
But now I'm in a six speed, I'm on the run
I swear I had this, world in my hand when I was young
I swear I had the, world in my hand when I was young
I want to be like Dwyane Wade
I want to be like LeBron James, ayy
I had hoop dreams like Steph, ayy
I'm in a drug house with the meth
Feds tryna charge me a with a theft
All my dreams they done went to the left
I had hoop dreams nigga, I had hoop dreams nigga
Yeah, I had hoop dreams nigga, ayy
Yeah, I had hoop dreams nigga, yeah, I had hoop dreams nigga
Yeah, I had hoop dreams nigga

[Verse 2: K Camp]
My partner was servin' the rocks while I used to dribble the rock, I toss it over the block
Pull out the work form my sock, my niggas trappin' a lot, we tryna run up them knots
You nigga had hoop dreams but my partner wanna be Frank Lucas
Run and throwin' like Cam Newton
Act different, they gon' start shootin'
Money callin' so I got to pick it up, ring ring ring
I once had hoop dreams, had to switch my lanes
Had to find that calling, I'm gon' ball regardless
Most these niggas stallin', bough a brand new carbon
Please don't be my target, but this shit about hoop dreams
Tryna take it all home, I need new rings, yeah

[Chorus: Yung Bleu]
I used to have hoop dreams, just like LeBron
But now I'm in a six speed, I'm on the run
I swear I had this, world in my hand when I was young
I swear I had the, world in my hand when I was young
I want to be like Dwyane Wade
I want to be like LeBron James, ayy
I had hoop dreams like Steph, ayy
I'm in a drug house with the meth
Feds tryna charge me a with a theft
All my dreams they done went to the left
I had hoop dreams nigga, I had hoop dreams nigga
Yeah, I had hoop dreams nigga, ayy
Yeah, I had hoop dreams nigga, yeah, I had hoop dreams nigga
Yeah, I had hoop dreams nigga

[Verse 3: Lil Baby]
Never had no hoop dreams but I'm ballin' like I'm in the league
I guess I'm a role model, all these niggas follow me
They was playin' ball, I was in the hood sellin' weed
Had to get some money, I was hungry, I couldn't even eat
I'm like Dwyane Wade with the three
I'm like LeBron James in the paint
I want it now, I ain't gon' wait
I need a whole dime in the bank
I can give a damn what a nigga think
I'm on my shit and these niggas ain't
I'm doin' shit that these niggas can't
I can't expect a nigga to relate
I'm goin' up, these niggas hate it
Runnin' your mouth all, you ain't on your job
I was workin' hard, runnin' to them cars
I had to run it raw like I'm Jay-Z, these niggas broke and they lazy
I never let a nigga play me, these pussy niggas better pay me
I been servin' fiends ever day, ah
I ain't never had no fuckin' day job
All my mama ever did was work hard
Now she ain't gotta work thanks to her lil boy, yeah yeah

[Chorus: Yung Bleu]
I used to have hoop dreams, just like LeBron
But now I'm in a six speed, I'm on the run
I swear I had this, world in my hand when I was young
I swear I had the, world in my hand when I was young
I want to be like Dwyane Wade
I want to be like LeBron James, ayy
I had hoop dreams like Steph, ayy
I'm in a drug house with the meth
Feds tryna charge me a with a theft
All my dreams they done went to the left
I had hoop dreams nigga, I had hoop dreams nigga
Yeah, I had hoop dreams nigga, ayy
Yeah, I had hoop dreams nigga, yeah, I had hoop dreams nigga
Yeah, I had hoop dreams nigga
