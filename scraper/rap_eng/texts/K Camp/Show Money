[Verse 1: Tha Joker]
Feel like I got ADD, I swear I can't just relax
Boy I am flyer then you, it's packed from the front to the back
Which of these two bitches, up in here, got that slap
No I ain't got no virus bitch but tonight you goin get hat
Looking for the nigga with the gas
Talking 93, octane
So if my car on E
I can blow smoke in my tank
Hoes out showing their feet
Coming in the rain or the sleet
All the cars in the parking lot like Busey just got released
Smoking on the the couch, putting hoes in the cushion
Is we looking good, baby 'cuz we see you lookin
Leave her beat, bruised like a cup of Bens
?
Say you got a party on the other side of town
But you no good in where the fuck it's going down
Got gold on my watch and I ain't comb my hair
Bout to turn this bitch like commercials on their
Fat bitch came with the girdle on her
We running this bitch like a hurdle on there
Welcome to the ceiling, me and Camp turned up got yo girl trying to fuck up my circle up here

[Verse 2: K Camp]
Keep a few bands in the pocket
Boy I'm plugged in, fuck the socket
You know I'm the truth gotta call James Hart 'cuz I been taking off like a rocket
Got this shit covered up like a tent
Transformed in the booth, Clark Kent
Got yo ho with me
She ain't in love with a G
Gotta put her on a tum like a mint, hey
Man these boys can't see me, Ray
Want me for a show then you gotta pay
Yo man he a pussy, he a fish, fillet
Drinking on Hen, while she on Bombay
Yeah you know we with it
Me and Joker trynna get it
Rolling stones so rock and roll and give these hoes that golden ticket
That's my work
All in the cup with the Earth
Turned up, sup nigga what
All in her butt
Finna make a movie uncut
Stay making plays, Nick Hutt
Stay turned up
We ain't goin to make that movie if you ain't talking that show money
Nigga you broke, stay out here looking cray, I can tell that you ain't got no money

Young nigga working, plus I'm flyer then Aladin
