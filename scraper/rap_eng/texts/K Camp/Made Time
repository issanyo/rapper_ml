[Intro]
Yea, yea
Yea, yea
You know we at it again mothafucka

[Chorus]
The last nigga that you with, I swear is old news
I got time if you got time to check my risk baby
Add a couple of VVS on ya fist baby
His and hers matching coupes but we can switch baby
Send that addy where you at and I'ma roll through
I make time for you
I make time for you
I make time for you
I make time
I make time for you
I make time for you

[Verse 1]
When I'm in your city
I'ma hit yo phone up
I can't wait to see you
Shawty we can go up
I got hoes and you got hoes but that don't bother me
At this moment it's just us girl you my property
We just need some privacy
That's him calling, gotta be
Tell yo man do not disturb
You gon' get what you deserve
You gon' get what you been calling for
If he hating on me, I'll fuck all his hoes
That shit ain't important, but girl I'm worried bout you
Take yo to ass to Phipps, leave that pussy brand new
Tell them other hoes don't worry how we move
Got you for the night so I ain't worried bout ol' dude
Wayy

[Chorus]
The last nigga that you with, I swear is old news
I got time if you got time to check my risk baby
Add a couple of VVS on ya fist baby
His and hers matching coupes but we can switch baby
Send that addy where you at and I'ma roll through
I make time for you
I make time for you
I make time for you
I make time
I make time for you
I make time for you

[Verse 2]
I'm that nigga, you that bitch ,but you know I got flavors
Just because you seen she text me that don't mean we dating
All them emojis for ya contact yea that mean you special
Roll that loud and catch this contact girl, can we get sexual
Hit you when I'm in your town
Bring that pussy round
You know I'ma lock you down, get rid of that clown
You know you need me, me
Can we hit the mall and buy you some VVS?
Shawty soaking wet you know I need that Fiji
I'ma turn you up, I hope your nigga see me
I make time for you
I make time for you
Put yo phone on silent, have yo girlfriend lie for ya

[Chorus]
The last nigga that you with, I swear is old news
I got time if you got time to check my risk baby
Add a couple of VVS on ya fist baby
His and hers matching coupes but we can switch baby
Send that addy where you at and I'ma roll through
I make time for you
I make time for you
I make time for you
I make time
I make time for you
I make time for you
