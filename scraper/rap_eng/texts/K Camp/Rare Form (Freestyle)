[Intro]
I'm a G
Can't say Genius if you ain't talking about my DJ

[Hook]
Leaders be baptized, take a nap time
Shoot them dice, shoot them dice, bitch it's crap time
That's a Porsche, hella horses
Well of course I tried for verses
I tried for my parents, look at my parents
Why the fuck you hating if you shop at clearance?
Ain't nothing wrong with it, bitch I did it too
But I got up off my ass and went got the loot
But I got up off my ass and found a booth

[Interlude]
Hey Genius give 'em that flood fool

[Hook]
Leaders be baptized, take a nap time
Shoot them dice, shoot them dice, bitch it's crap time
That's a Porsche, hella horses
Well of course I tried for verses
I tried for my parents, look at my parents
Why the fuck you hating if you shop at clearance?
Ain't nothing wrong with it, bitch I did it too
But I got up off my ass and went got the loot
But I got up off my ass and found a booth

[Verse]
Now I'm riding down Rodeo with no fucking roof
I've been at this shit so long, I got the fucking proof
I can see it in your eyes, you not gon' tell the truth
It's that cash talk, that's that bad talk
That's that anywhere you go, you show your ass talk
This that hold your nuts on folks that try to laugh talk
This that bitch can I just slap you on your ass talk?
It's that whole foods, everything organic
Everything A1, lil nigga don't panic
Far removed from this planet
Mindset on stranded
On my own
Looking out for the bad bitches that's home alone
So glad that the summer gone
Top hat like Al Capone
Big bread, hella cheese, shit I'm just getting my deli on
Throwed like I got a belly on
I'm just here for the millions
I think the engine inside the trunk
In Miami eating shrimp and coke
I swear my man raise a pump
Thank God I ain't vote for Trump
But a nigga won anyway
The world fucked up anyway
I'm just glad I got a place to stay
Clocked in and the trap full
All I need is a lil blunt, some Adderral, and some Red Bull
