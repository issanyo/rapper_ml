[Intro]
It's about 2:50 AM, geeked up
Vibin' the fuck out
Shawty keep callin' me though
Man, I ain't got no time for that shit, for real

[Pre-Chorus]
Yup, shawty wanna kick shit but I'm tied up
Turn to a freak when she get wired up
When you see a bad bitch, better holler
Ratchet ass ho can't get no love
Bitch I'm a star, better bring the crowd up
Told her don't spit, girl you gotta swallow
Fuck then dip, call me tomorrow
Next week, caught her ass bustin' in the club
Tryna get geeked, where the bud?
Everywhere I go, they show love
Bitches want hugs
Said I won't pop this week
But a nigga fell in love with the drugs

[Chorus]
Shawty just 'cause your ass fine that don't mean
You can get what you want, maybe you can
Maybe you can't, roll up the dank
Body a canvas, I'm tryna paint

[Verse 1]
When I'm in that pussy, don't get no complaints
Shawty a freak but she act like a saint
Feel like JB, I might shoot to the bank
Feel like JB, I might shoot to the bank
You see I'm gettin' that money, you ain't
Count up a hundred and make that bitch faint
I am your pops, you know who you should thank
Hop in the 'Rari and fill up the tank
Let's go, set the world on fire (Yeah)
Don't wanna see you 'mire (Yeah)
Fuck that nigga prior
Said you like Mariah (Ooh)
Look at me, I'm flyer
Yes, okay, 'member it was all just a dream
Tryna put dick in her spleen (Ayy)

[Pre-Chorus]
Yup, shawty wanna kick shit but I'm tied up
Turn to a freak when she get wired up
When you see a bad bitch, better holler
Ratchet ass ho can't get no love
Bitch I'm a star, better bring the crowd up
Told her don't spit, girl you gotta swallow
Fuck then dip, call me tomorrow
Next week, caught her ass bustin' in the club
Tryna get geeked, where the bud?
Everywhere I go, they show love
Bitches want hugs
Said I won't pop this week
But a nigga fell in love with the drugs

[Chorus]
Shawty just 'cause your ass fine that don't mean
You can get what you want, maybe you can
Maybe you can't, roll up the dank
Body a canvas, I'm tryna paint

[Verse 2]
Turned to a boss, I plotted this shit
Give me a B and I'm out of this bitch
Not talkin' Bentley, talkin' 'bout billions
I am your daddy, I love my children
Life gettin' crazy, I need a healing
Remember the feeling when I brought a mil' in
Sorry I'm just not your local civilian
Energy switch when I'm in the building
Travel the world, I move like a pilgram
Ain't satisfied with the bitch? Then just build one
Play with the fans, you might fuck 'round and kill one
They thought I was a real nigga, I'm still one
Told you it's best you should stay out your feelings
She only call me for sexual healing
Sexual healing, I'm in that pussy like

[Pre-Chorus]
Shawty wanna kick shit but I'm tied up
Turn to a freak when she get wired up
When you see a bad bitch, better holler
Ratchet ass ho can't get no love
Bitch I'm a star, better bring the crowd up
Told her don't spit, girl you gotta swallow
Fuck then dip, call me tomorrow
Next week, caught her ass bustin' in the club
Tryna get geeked, where the bud?
Everywhere I go, they show love
Bitches want hugs
Said I won't pop this week
But a nigga fell in love with the drugs

[Chorus]
Shawty just 'cause your ass fine that don't mean
You can get what you want, maybe you can
Maybe you can't, roll up the dank
Body a canvas, I'm tryna paint

[Outro]
I'm tryna paint
I'm tryna paint
Body a canvas
Shawty just 'cause your ass fine that don't mean
You can get what you want, maybe you can
Maybe you can't, roll up the dank
Body a canvas, I'm tryna paint
