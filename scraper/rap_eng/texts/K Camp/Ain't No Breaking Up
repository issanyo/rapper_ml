[Verse 1: True Story Gee]
How you gon' leave when I want you to stay?
Trippin' on me, want me out of your face
I'm on the road with the gang gettin' cake
Ain't breakin' up, I'll give you some space
Tellin' your friends that you done with the boy
Stop by the cabin, I know you ain't skatin'
Startin' no cryin', don't shed no tear
Call my phone, I'ma be right here
I done put ten in both of your ears
Hop in my whip, let's Tokyo Drift
Look at my bitch, she ain't goin' nowhere
I want smoke 'bout this right here
If you gon' ride, don't waste my time (Oh, ooh-whoa-oh)
If I say you mine, just know you mine (Oh, ooh-whoa-oh)
Ain't no breakin' up

[Chorus: True Story Gee]
Ain't no breakin' up, ain't no breakin' up (Aw yeah, hey)
Ain't no breakin' up (Hey)

Ain't no, ayy, ayy, ooh yeah
Ain't no breakin' up, ain't no breakin' up (Aw yeah)
Ain't no breakin' up
Ain't no breakin' up, ain't no breakin' up (Aw yeah, what?)
Ain't no

[Post-Chorus: True Story Gee]
How you gon' leave? (you was just, down)

I know you (Ridin'), hey (Ooh yeah)
Ain't no breakin' up (Ain't no breakin' up, yeah)
What? What? What?

[Verse 2: True Story Gee]
What the fuck you think you doin'?
Who the fuck you think you foolin'?
Ain't pickin' up when I'm callin' your phone
I'm pullin' up, finna clear this shit, you know I'm with this shit
Baby I'm scarred up, got my guard up
I put your diamonds on water
She do the most and a nigga record her (Ice Starr)
Pussy so good, got me callin' her mama
She in that Benz and she came from a Honda (Hey)
She never fucked on my partners (Hey)
Baby don't play with a shotta (Hey)

Neck hit bright like yeah
Might pull up on you right away
Fuck around and ruin your day
Bitch you ain't goin', no way

[Chorus: True Story Gee]
Ain't no breakin' up (Fuck wrong with you man?)
Ain't no breakin' up (This ain't no game, you hear me? Hey, hey)
Ain't no breakin' up (I said you're mine you're mine)
Ain't no breakin' up (Bitch, Ice Starr)

But I know you ridin'
Ooh yeah
