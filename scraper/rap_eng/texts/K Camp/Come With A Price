[Intro]
Shit little mama act right I might just spend it on her
I usually don't but shit I know what's hannin' wit it
Talk to 'em

[Chorus]
That pussy come with a price
Girl what you say, me and you can have the time of your life?
I only got you for the night
I don't know how I'm feeling, but a nigga just might
Addicted to the pussy, I'm feeling like an addict
Bitch stop playing, got to know that I'm having it
Five for the pants, 'bout five for the jacket
Fuck me real good, you can fuck around and have it
That pussy come with a price
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Girl what you say, me and you can have the time of your life?
Have the time of your life

[Verse 1]
Yea, yea, yea
Shawty know whats happening with the kid (oh)
Lil nigga popping big shit (oh)
Lil nigga copping big shit
She gone wanna fuck when she look at my risk
She gonna fuck when she look at my whip
Let her get a taste of the life, she can taste me tonight
Ay girl let me gon' see that shape in the light
Got me beating on my chest like a ape in a fight
When I'm done little shawty might hate me tonight
'Cause she know I'm coming hard (ball with the boy)
Bitch stay down I might buy you a toy
Vroom vroom, oh boy
Ching Ching
Dollar signs
Since back then, been 'bout mine
Little shawty let me hit 'bout time
Little shawty let me hit 'bout time
Yeah yeah
Drop a few bands in your purse
You gotta show me that you're worth it
You gotta show me that your perfect
You gotta show me you with the shits
You gotta show me that you is that bitch
You gotta show me
Show me, show me

[Chorus]
That pussy come with a price
Girl what you say, me and you can have the time of your life?
I only got you for the night
I don't know how I'm feeling, but a nigga just might
Addicted to the pussy, I'm feeling like an addict
Bitch stop playing, got to know that I'm having it
Five for the pants, 'bout five for the jacket
Fuck me real good, you can fuck around and have it
That pussy come with a price
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Girl what you say, me and you can have the time of your life?
Have the time of your life

[Verse 2]
Yea look
First class take a trip, where ya passport ?
I'ma run into the pussy like a crash course
Still fucking with your ex, that's a bad choice
Doing everything I can to make the cat moist
New sport off the lot, got you wide open
Three shots of that Hen got you wide open
Catch this, baby, leave that mouth wide open
Running routes through the pussy, girl, I'm wide open
I'm floating, too focused, bad bitch got her own, yea I know this
Saks Fifth, go shopping, you gotta know this
Backwood pre-rolled, girl, you gotta smoke this
I heard shawty ain't nice
Shawty ain't
Hop in the foreign and disappear in the night
Met her through the DM and booked her flight

[Chorus]
That pussy come with a price
Girl what you say, me and you can have the time of your life?
I only got you for the night
I don't know how I'm feeling, but a nigga just might
Addicted to the pussy, I'm feeling like an addict
Bitch stop playing, got to know that I'm having it
Five for the pants, 'bout five for the jacket
Fuck me real good, you can fuck around and have it
That pussy come with a price
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Girl what you say, me and you can have the time of your life?
Have the time of your life

[Outro]
Come with a price
Come with a price
Come with a price
Haha
Yeah, yeah
