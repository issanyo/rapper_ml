[Hook: K Camp]
Let's get money, my nigga

[Verse 1: K Camp]
Don't let nobody tell you that your dreams is some bullshit
Cause I done been through some bullshit
Tired of the bullshit
Cutting out them niggas on that bullshit
Just want to see my niggas living well
Pockets like a wishing well
Boy you better tell your bitch to climb out
Coach put me in the game, we need a timeout
All these niggas flexing, living lies, let me find out
They don't want to keep it real no more
They don't want to keep it real no more
And it's a damn shame
Know some niggas that will kill for the dough
Know some niggas that will kill for the dough
Nigga bang bang
I'm a hustler, nigga I'm a hustler
Inspection grade A, happy customer
She getting money too, the reason why I fuck with her
And she fuck with me, I guess a nigga stuck with her

[Hook: K Camp]
Let's get money, my nigga
Let's get money, my nigga
Let's get money, my nigga
Let's get money
I see it coming, my nigga
I see it coming, my nigga
I see it coming, my nigga
You got to want it
Let's get money, my nigga
Let's get money, my nigga
Let's get money, my nigga
Let's get money
They been frontin', my nigga
I know you frontin', my nigga
Get some money, my nigga
Get some money

[Verse 2: CyHi The Prynce]
My label say I need some more relevancy
I'm used to dodging intelligence intelligently
They didn't find no evidence evidently
Plus I rep the presidents that represent me
My campaign strong, I should run for presidency
Hit the strip club off of Cheshire Bridge
We fucked up a few commas then I left with a free
Definitely, definitely, definitely
Can't lay with these bitches cause I'm not a liar
Holding on to these hoes, I'm not a firefighter
I just stab and cut them off, I feel like Michael Myers
You got hate in your blood, you done copped a virus
Niggas mad I'm eating good and you on a diet
I've been counting so much money I got arthritis
The greatest story ever told, watch an author write it
These walkie talkie rappers copy, got to copyright it
I feel like them Jordans, white and black 11s
It's fucked up you even got to patent leather
I'm a alpha, got a castle out in Alpharetta
Shawty want to kick it but I'm not Kubota
But I rather get this money, baby, now or never
Everyday I'm trying to at least make a stack or better
Sometimes I wish Ye and Cudi got back together
What if me, Push and Sean did a track together?
Fuck the bullshit
Let's get money, my nigga

[Hook: K Camp]
Let's get money, my nigga
Let's get money, my nigga
Let's get money, my nigga
Let's get money
I see it coming, my nigga
I see it coming, my nigga
I see it coming, my nigga
You got to want it
Let's get money, my nigga
Let's get money, my nigga
Let's get money, my nigga
Let's get money
They been frontin', my nigga
I know you frontin', my nigga
Get some money, my nigga
