[Intro]
I love Camp, ha
Touchdown, touchdown
Touchdown, touchdown
Touchdown, touchdown
Can't wait

[Verse 1]
I ain't seen you in a minute
That's that long distance
We know what we got
Tell them bitches my name business
Girl I'm at the W I call you when I finish
Yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah
She never fuck with a nigga like me and I can tell
And I don't give a fuck what they say lil mama you bad as hell
And every time she step on the scene my baby gon' give 'em hell
I know she bout that bread on the side doin' hair and nails
Gon' get it, make that money just don't let it make you
Gon' get it, I got money and I just might spend it on you
If you act right might call ya the boo
Hop on a plane, take a trip to Peru
Hop on a plane, take a trip, take a friend
Airports down, bag full of bands
We gon' do this, we gon' do this shit the right way
We gon' do this, we gon' do this shit the right way
Pull up, hop in, you know how it goes down
And you know what's poppin' when I touch down in your town

[Hook]
Touchdown, touchdown
Touchdown, touchdown
Touchdown, touchdown
Touchdown, touchdown
Touchdown, touchdown
Touchdown, touchdown

[Verse 2]
Shawty like it when I get it from the back yeah-yeah
The way I break it in, you might leave here in a wheel chair
The way I break you in, you might try to tell your friends
But don't tell them much cause she might pull up in that Benz
Skrt-skrt
I know these bitches ain't shit but I'ma treat you like my queen
Skrt-skrt
Might hit sex no less and a nigga don't do those things
Next year show up in some Dolce jeans
I know you last man had low paid dreams
Baby here you go, 4k for the rings
If you ain't notice every day for a queen
Baby hold that
I've been broke so long I swear to God that I won't go back
Walk in Louis V, fuck it up and make it right back
Blow those bands and say I did it on accident
If she don't act right I'm trashin' it
I know little mama can't wait for a nigga to touchdown

[Hook]
Touchdown, touchdown
Touchdown, touchdown
Touchdown, touchdown
Touchdown, touchdown
Touchdown, touchdown
Touchdown, touchdown

[Bridge]
Blow those bands and say I did it on accident
Did it on accident, did it on accident
Blow those bands and say I did it on accident
Did it on accident, did it on accident

[Hook]
Touchdown, touchdown
Touchdown, touchdown
Touchdown, touchdown
Touchdown, touchdown
Touchdown, touchdown
Touchdown, touchdown

[Outro]
In a minute
Long distance
We got
My name business
I'm at the W, I'll call you when I'm finished
When I'm finished
When I'm finished
I love Camp, ha
