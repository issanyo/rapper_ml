[Hook]
She bad, she mine, she know, she know, she get money
Damn right, she know it's alright
She know she the baddest of them all
She know she the baddest of them all
She knows she the baddest of them all
She knows she the baddest of them all

[Verse 1]
You know you my baby, even that's an understatement
Spend a week off in Vegas, cosmo getting faded
See my shawty on her shit and these other bitches hate it
Summer time, drop the top, now we riding in the latest
She gon' ride me like an Uber, baby hallelujah
Catch us right on South Beach, Ocean Drive, pushing scooters
Baby that's my shooter, don't let it confuse ya
We be doing things that yo momma wouldn't approve
Fucking on the balcony, love when you on top of me
Shawty give it all up, feel like this a robbery
Feel like this supposed to be, tell me if I'm wrong
I can fuck you to this song

[Hook]
She bad, she mine, she know, she know, she get money
Damn right, she know it's alright
She know she the baddest of them all
She know she the baddest of them all
She knows she the baddest of them all
She knows she the baddest of them all

[Verse 2]
Shawty know she my rider, we gon' set this shit on fire
No discussion, straight to fucking, baby fuck it, let's get higher
If you saying he can do it like I do it, he a liar
It ain't nothing in this world that a nigga won't buy ya
Let me hit it in the backseat, I can't let her pass me
Quite on the low, behind the scenes, that girl get nasty
Elegant and classy, but lil shawty tax me
I know she won't leave because she know just where that cash be
And she want some more, what you tripping for?
I know you was ready soon as you walked through that door
Yo walk through that door, tell me if I'm wrong
I can fuck you to this song

[Hook]
She bad, she mine, she know, she know, she get money
Damn right, she know it's alright
She know she the baddest of them all
She know she the baddest of them all
She knows she the baddest of them all
She knows she the baddest of them all
