[Intro]
C-C-CorMill
RARE Sound

[Chorus]
Ever had your back up against the wall
Young nigga just tryna eat (Tryna eat)
Hell yeah nigga, gotta cherish my dawgs
Lost too many to the streets (Long live)
Jumped out the Porsche and I hopped in the frog
Skrrt, beep beep
Give me that bag, I'ma show you how to ball (Ball)
It’s on me (On me)
Ever had your back up against the wall
Young nigga just tryna eat (Tryna eat)
Hell yeah nigga, gotta cherish my dawgs
Lost too many to the streets (To the streets)
Jumped out the Porsche and I hopped in the frog
Skrrt, beep beep (Beep beep)
Give me that sack, I'ma show you how to ball (Ball)
It's on me (On me, let’s go)

[Verse 1]
She gon' pick up every time I call, it's on me
Climb on top and just sit on this log (Sit on this log), ooh-wee
Her pussy get wet every time I ball, truly (Truly)
Think I'm the shit, fucked up the whole stall, who me?
I cannot make this shit up, please look into my eyes
I told myself I won't turn on my guys (Let's go)
Trade out my guys
When I'm alone I just look to the sky (Look to the sky)
Cherish my baby, I know she a prize (Cherish my baby)
I know she a prize (Know she a prize)
You can see in my eyes
I want the money, it ain't no surprise

[Chorus]
Ever had your back up against the wall
Young nigga just tryna eat (Yeah)
Hell yeah nigga, gotta cherish my dawgs
Lost too many to the streets (My dawgs)
Jumped out the Porsche and I hopped in the frog
Skrrt, beep beep
Give me that bag, I’ma show you how to ball (Ball)
It’s on me (On me)
Ever had your back up against the wall
Young nigga just tryna eat (Tryna eat)
Hell yeah nigga, gotta cherish my dawgs
Lost too many to the streets (To the streets)
Jumped out the Porsche and I hopped in the frog
Skrrt (Jump), beep beep (Beep beep)
Give me that sack, I'ma show you how to ball (Ball)
It’s on me (On me)

[Verse 2]
If you ain't with gang, I ain't even tryna cherish, for real
A bitch play with it, she gon' get embarrassed, better chill
Say congratulations, me and money got married, big bills (Racks)
Any real nigga ain’t playin' 'bout his karat (Facts), don't get killed
I'm off the drank, ain't no sippin' it slow
If she ain't fuckin', the bitch gotta go (She gotta go)
Pop me an addy, creative control
Send him the addy, he send me the load (Send me the load)
My finger is froze (My fingers)
These niggas is hoes (These niggas)
Behind doors they just wanna see you fucked up
Oh look at me, I done lucked up

[Chorus]
Ever had your back up against the wall
Young nigga just tryna eat (Tryna eat)
Hell yeah nigga, gotta cherish my dawgs
Lost too many to the streets (Long live)
Jumped out the Porsche and I hopped in the frog
Skrrt, beep beep
Give me that bag, I'ma show you how to ball (Ball)
It's on me (On me)
Ever had your back up against the wall
Young nigga just tryna eat (Tryna eat)
Hell yeah nigga, gotta cherish my dawgs
Lost too many to the streets (To the streets)
Jumped out the Porsche and I hopped in the frog
Skrrt, beep beep (Beep beep)
Give me that sack, I'ma show you how to ball (Ball)
It's on me (On me)

[Outro]
Show you how to ball
Show you how to ball (Show me)
Show you how to ball
Ever had your back up against the wall (Congratulations)
Show you how to ball
Show you how to ball (Show me)
Show you how to ball
Ever had your back up against the wall (Ooh)
Beep beep, show me
Truly, no sleep
