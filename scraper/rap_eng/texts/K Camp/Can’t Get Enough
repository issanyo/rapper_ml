[Intro]
Sound, wait
One, two, two

[Verse 1]
Huh, she say she proud of me, I ain't did shit yet
Bet the house on me, baby, let's bet
I got niggas tryna ride on me
That’s why I’m holdin’ this TEC (Bah)
Got you lame ass niggas upset
Tell these bitches they can’t hide from me
I'm praying that my bitch lie for me
Got the 'rari outside for me (Skrrt)
Watch that bitch glide for me
Tell 'em come see (Hey)
You ain’t met a nigga like me (Hey)

[Chorus]
Now picture me holding you (Let's go)
And sometimes I can't lie, girl, I'm tryna get over you (Tryna get over you)
And I’ll never let a nigga talk down and run over you (Nah)
Fuck the bullshit, baby, I'm just tryna get close to you (Tryna get close to you)
Telling you the truth
Baby, tell me what you want to do

[Post-Chorus]
Say you wanna meet same place, same time (Woo)
Put it on my face, anywhere, that’s fine
I can’t even lie, girl, you still on my mind
Say you done with that last nigga, baby, stop lying
I can’t get enough of you (Yeah)
And you can let them bitches talk
Girl, you know that I fuck with you (Facts), yeah

[Verse 2]
Hah, look
You be getting on my nerves, getting on my nerves (Gettin' on my nerves)
I’ll bust for you quick, baby, say the word (Pow, pow, pow)
You was fucking with the kid when I was in the dirt (I was in the dirt)
So I'm doing everything I can to try to make it work
If I tell you my secrets would you keep 'em? (What?)
Searching for a down bitch, you know I need one (Yeah)
I’ve been in the streets and I still ain’t seen none
That’s why you in my sheets, now you know

[Chorus]
Now picture me holding you (Now picture me holding you, hm)
And sometimes I can't lie, girl, I'm tryna get over you (Yeah)
And I’ll never let a nigga talk down and run over you (I’ll never let a nigga talk down, I’ll never let a nigga talk down)
I'm just tryna get close to you
Telling you the truth (What?)
Baby, tell me what you want to do (Let's go)

[Post-Chorus]
Say you wanna meet same place, same time (Same time)
Put it on my face, anywhere, that’s fine (That's fine)
I can’t even lie, girl, you still on my mind (Woo)
Say you done with that last nigga, baby, stop lying
I can’t get enough of you (Woo, yeah)
And you can let them bitches talk
Girl, you know that I fuck with you (Know that I fuck with you, yeah)

[Outro]
Now picture me holding you
And sometimes I can’t lie, girl, I’m tryna get over you (Yeah)
And I’ll never let a nigga talk down and run over you
And I’ll never let a nigga talk down, I’ll never let a nigga talk down
I’m just tryna get close to you
What? Let's go
