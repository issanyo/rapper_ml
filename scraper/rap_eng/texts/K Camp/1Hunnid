I let you count my money, baby
You 1hunnid so that means you meet my standards, baby
I got a lot of hoes, more than I can handle, baby
And I can't even lie, shawty you my kind of lady
So what you doin' later?
Let you count my money, baby
You 1hunnid so that means you meet my standards, baby
I got a lot of hoes, more than I can handle, baby
And I can't even lie, shawty you my kind of lady
And that's 1hunnid, baby, just keep it a hunnid, baby
Just keep it a hunnid, baby

[Verse 1]
Aye you 1hunnid, baby?
I'm just tryna figure out just why that nigga hate me
I got money and I throw it with no hesitation
Sneaky bitches, they be schemin' and investigatin'
But I'ma leave 'em waitin', put you in that drop top
Pull up in that mothafucka, make your heart stop
Lame bitches on the side tryna cock block
I pulled off her panties, next it was the crop top
And I will not stop, tell 'em 'bout our situation
It ain't really hard to tell by all the moves I'm makin'
Takin' all these nigga's bitches, you can say I'm Drakein'
I'm that nigga, you that bitch and ain't no damn mistakin'
So tell me why we waitin'

And I can't even lie, shawty you my kind of lady
So what you doin' later?
Let you count my money, baby
You 1hunnid so that means you meet my standards, baby
I got a lot of hoes, more than I can handle, baby
And I can't even lie, shawty you my kind of lady
And that's 1hunnid, baby, just keep it a hunnid, baby
Just keep it a hunnid, baby

[Verse 2]
Okay now I'm back again
Rubber bands on rubber bands, you can tell a friend
Slumber party, top floor, bring 'em all in
Missed call, that's your old lady callin'
I think she fallin', she like the way I keep it G
Heard my name around the city, girl you know it's me
You say you bored, let's get some money, no Monopoly
Ain't no flexin' on my pay, I get that broccoli
So ain't no stoppin' me, she like the way that cash feel
Lay it down, I'ma eat it like my last meal
Blew a hundred, still got hundreds in the stash still
She turned nothin' into somethin' and that ass real
Welcome to Cashville
