[Intro]
It's about 1 AM, I'm just smoking and recording
Let's get high, fuck that bullshit
Let's get high, fuck that bullshit
Let's get high, fuck that bullshit
Let's get high
Talk to 'em Camp

[Hook]
Bitch I'm heaven sent, I'm too fly
Keep that cash on me, you know why
They ain't playing fair so I keep that fire
Fuck that bullshit, let's get high

[Verse 1]
I just rolled another, now let's float
It's that real pressure, please don't toke
You don't see my highs, all black Locs
Bitch I'm camouflage, woah
Out that ziplock to that scale
He gon' get it all through the mail
Bust that bag open, share that smell
I ain't ordinary, you can tell

[Hook]
Bitch I'm heaven sent, I'm too fly
Keep that cash on me, you know why
They ain't playing fair so I keep that fire
Fuck that bullshit, let's get high

[Interlude]
Let's get high, let's get high, let's get high, let's get high
Let's get high, let's get high, let's get high, let's get high
Let's get high, let's get high, let's get high, let's get high
(Welcome to Lyric Ave)
I'm still smoke that, I be in my thoughts when I smoke that
Light that motherfucker up

[Verse 2]
Girl you fine as hell and you too
Tryna find that pussy, peak-a-boo
They can't stop me now, boo-hoo-hoo
I'm the bad guy, let me through
Need some lost tales, baby tell ya
Let me give 'em hell kicking major flavor
They start hating when I started getting paper
Sucker for that pussy but I never save her

[Bridge]
Fuck that bullshit, let's get high
Fuck that bullshit, let's get high
Fuck that bullshit, let's get high

[Hook]
I ain't ordinary, I'm too fly
Keep that cash on me, you know why
They ain't playing fair so I keep that fire
They ain't playing fair so I keep that fire

[Outro]
