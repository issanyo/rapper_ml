[Intro]
Rare Sound

[Chorus]
Who get naked
Who get naked (who get naked)
All this drinking, who get naked (who get naked)
Who get naked
Who get naked (who get naked)
All this drinking, who get naked
Who get naked
Who get naked (who get naked)
All this drinking, who get naked (who get naked)
Who get naked
Who get naked
All this drinking who get naked

[Verse 1]
Kicking flavor
I can't save her
Beat that pussy' til the morning
Wake the neighbors
Too much paper
Shrimp with cages
Fill that cup up with Henny watch it fade her
Second round it go down
What you drinking Hen or Crown
Stop that flexing, we got Uber
She keep taking shots
My lil shooter
Yea, yea

[Chorus]
Who get naked
Who get naked (who get naked)
All this drinking, who get naked (who get naked)
Who get naked
Who get naked (who get naked)
All this drinking, who get naked
Who get naked
Who get naked (who get naked)
All this drinking, who get naked (who get naked)
Who get naked
Who get naked
All this drinking who get naked

[Verse 2]
Slum!
Why shawty say I'm so cold
Leave them clothes on the floor
More gassed then a Texaco
I'm in that garden like Rose
So I ain't mad at you
Bet them hoes won't laugh at you
When I spend that big bag on you
Throw this fucking cash on you
She do what I ask her to
That Gucci, that Saint Laurent
She digging my fashion too
She popping and she ain't stopping
I wonder if she can handle
I got her right where I want her
We faded inside the Phatnom
And the question is

[Chorus]
Who get naked
Who get naked (who get naked)
All this drinking, who get naked (who get naked)
Who get naked
Who get naked (who get naked)
All this drinking, who get naked
Who get naked
Who get naked (who get naked)
All this drinking, who get naked (who get naked)
Who get naked
Who get naked
All this drinking who get naked

Who get naked
Who get naked
All this drinking, who get naked
Who get naked
Who get naked
All this drinking, who get naked
