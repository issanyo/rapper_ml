[Intro: K Camp]
I ain't trying to impress nobody
Any nigga saying that they are the realest
Then who the hell am I?
I don't know

[Hook: K Camp]
A lot of niggas saying that they are the realest
But if you are the realest, who the hell am I?
Hear these niggas out here talking like they killers
The same ones who scared to put that on they life
I ain't trying to impress nobody
I ain't trying to stress nobody
I hear these niggas out here saying they the realest
But if you are the realest, who the hell am I?

[Verse 1: K Camp]
You the type to count a nigga pockets
You the type that can't keep his word
I'm the type to go smoke a blunt
And if I'm high enough I might sip the syrup
You ain't really who you say you is
Living life with that mask on when them hunger pains
I'll have a savage nigga running in your shit
With no mast on, and I'm past gone
Not fearing nobody but God, I speak this shit from my heart
Bitches and money tear niggas apart
I been this way from the start
Long road but I learned quick
You the type to always run yo mouth
Always talk about it but never earn shit
I'm on my bridge, never burn shit
Next to Diddy Kenny Burns shit
If you don't know you better learn quick
I hold my hundreds with a firm grip
Always busy like the West End
Word out I'm the best in
Made the money counter my best friend

[Hook: K Camp]
A lot of niggas saying that they are the realest
But if you are the realest, who the hell am I?
Hear these niggas out here talking like they killers
The same ones who scared to put that on they life
I ain't trying to impress nobody
I ain't trying to stress nobody
I hear these niggas out here saying they the realest
But if you are the realest, who the hell am I?

[Verse 2: Yo Gotti]
I'm just gon' ride for my niggas
I'm down to die for my niggas
Put my niggas on game, how to cut up
These millions, anybody a hitter
Give them a mission and pistol
Because you come up and holla
That don't make you my nigga
How many niggas you owe, how many niggas you know
That was like brother before then fell out 'bout a ho
If I knew my nigga was getting high
Then he couldn't buy it from me
You my lil nigga, lil nigga money no value to me
I took lil Keion out the hood and changed his life foreal
Ask him when you can post up on this hill and go to Beverly Hills
It's on you if you ain't 'bout that action, then why the fuck you lie?
If you the realest nigga, then who the fuck am I?

[Hook: K Camp]
A lot of niggas saying that they are the realest
But if you are the realest, who the hell am I?
Hear these niggas out here talking like they killers
The same ones who scared to put that on they life
I ain't trying to impress nobody
I ain't trying to stress nobody
I hear these niggas out here saying they the realest
But if you are the realest, who the hell am I?

[Verse 3: K Camp]
I'm the type to put my niggas on
I'm the type that want to see you rich
You the type to go blow your check
Just for Instagram and a sneaky bitch
I'm the type to pull of the lot
Then look at yo then say you can too
I can't wait for my nigga Bo
To bust down that block in a two door coupe
They go twelve higher than I ever been
Mambo hide that scale
Bitch I been a heavyweight
You niggas too frail
You might break my heart
But you can't break this truth I tell
Real niggas do cry too
When my album drop I hope you buy two
When it's all done I'ma die true
I said real niggas do try to
Hella naked bitches playing Taboo
Done turned the mansion to a damn zoo

[Hook: K Camp]
A lot of niggas saying that they are the realest
But if you are the realest, who the hell am I?
Hear these niggas out here talking like they killers
The same ones who scared to put that on they life
I ain't trying to impress nobody
I ain't trying to stress nobody
I hear these niggas out here saying they the realest
But if you are the realest, who the hell am I?
