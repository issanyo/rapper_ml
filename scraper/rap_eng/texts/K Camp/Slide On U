[Intro: Boogie]
Ay just know I'm sliding in DMs all year
Thirst 48

[Hook: K Camp]
I'ma slide on you, slide on you
We know your dude weak so when he go to sleep
I'ma slide on you, slide on you
Just drop a pinpoint tell me where to meet and
I'ma slide on you, slide on you
Shit like lowkey been at it all week tryna
Slide on you, slide on you
Shit I put that on me you all me I'm tryna
Slide on you, slide on you

[Verse 1: Boogie]
You change your number every other month
Its hard to keep a line on you, a line on you, uh
I think its gold in that pussy, I see it I got my mind on you
I'm tryna dig pass, uh, like
How you always catch me slipping with your slick ass, uh
You the type to make me quit rap
Been making up my mishaps
Like shout out to your maker, I just saying God you did that
I ain't that nigga asking where my pics at
I ain't gon' screenshot your snaps so you can get mad
Just don't be tripping and start lurking through my friends add
Or blowing up my phone cause you see I'm at a kick back
Cause after I'ma slide on you

Shit like lowkey been at it all week tryna
Slide on you, slide on you

Baby girl she like my drug yeah, antidote
And I'm fucking with lil shorty cause she do the most
She ain't tryna play no games with you wack ass niggas
Riding shotgun in the back ass niggas
When in public dunno how to act ass niggas
Sharing bottles in the club sap ass niggas

Put a couple in the air and just vibe with you
Put her on them skates and just glide with you
