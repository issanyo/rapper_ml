[Chorus]
Fuck you saying keep them racks in my pants
Just like khaled just like perry just like [?]

[Verse 1]
I can't go out sad like rob, hoe do your job, bitch it's the mob
I can't go out sad like rob, she for the squad, I just want the slob

Silly hoe, cannot [?] that throat, lemme know, 'fore I hit that door
I want more, hit the corner store, I need condoms, 3 times in a row
