[Intro]
Sound
XL EAGLE Made It

[Chorus]
Ran up a check and I didn't look back
Don't want your bitch, that hoe was wack
What is you doing? Run up a sack
She want to argue, I won't react
Blow me a 50 and make it right back
I am a player bitch, I am a mack
If it ain't about money
Please don't hit my jack
If it ain't about money, please don't hit my jack (wooh)
Truck presidential, you know it's a lack
I put the north and the gang on my back
She in her feelings, I can't get attached
She on the molly, she about to collapse
I'm from the mud so you know I adapt
You is a bitch, you ain't getting no dap
Got to know my nigga bow and a trap
Might hit the block and shoot me some craps (wooh)

[Verse 1]
Bought me a Gucci fur just for the winter
She want to fuck 'cause a nigga a winner
I could fit about 20 hoes in a sprinter
You are not gang, please do not enter
Why they keep testing me, you know the recipe
Uncle got chickens, I'm talking sesame
It's a necessity, you are not catching me
Thanking the Lord 'cause I know he keep blessing me
Why do you question me, it ain't no flex in me
Pop me an ecstasy, I'm tryna fuck
She try to smoke on the lou and got stuck
Hopped out the beamer and jumped in the truck
New Valentino hoe, these ain't no chucks
That hoe a bird, she just want to get plucked
Bitch I'm on fire, I can't wait to erupt
Most of these rappers gone run out of luck

[Verse 2]
Don't stop, go hard
Shorty thick, oh lord
Big bank, big cars
Backwoods, no guards
Look up, see stars
Look up, see Mars
I'm scorchin', she gorgeous
Ferrari on 40's
Bigs horses, new Porches
Where the check at?
Important
Extortion made a fortune
That coco, she snorting
I take my time with this shit
And I ain't worried about none of you niggas lil' bih'
'Cause I grind for this shit, I did

[Hook]
Bih' let me do what I do
You know it cost for this view
That .22 on my shoe
I let it blow like a zoos
I'm known for breaking the rules
And my crib came with a pool
No I'm not fucking with dude
Shorty she think that I'm rude
Whip look like cranberry juice
Just tryna fuck on your girl
True story, pour me a deuce
Get on the beat and abuse
You know I'm never gone lose
Swim in that money like Scrooge
Bitch you ain't got no excuse
Rich or be broke nigga, choose
Wayy

[Bridge]
Whip look like cranberry juice
Just tryna fuck on your girl
True story, pour me a duece
Get on the beat and abuse
You know I'm never gone lose
Swim in that money like Scrooge
Bitch you ain't got no excuse
Rich or be broke nigga choose

[Chorus]
Ran up a check and I didn't look back
Don't want your bitch, that hoe was wack
What is you doing? Run up a sack
She want to argue, I won't react
Blow me a 50 and make it right back
I am a player bitch, I am a mack
If it ain't about money
Please don't hit my jack
If it ain't about money, please don't hit my jack
Truck presidential, you know it's a 'Lac
I put the north and the gang on my back
She in her feelings, I can't get attached
She on the molly, she about to collapse
I'm from the mud so you know I adapt
You is a bitch, you ain't getting no dap
Got to know my nigga bow and a trap
Might hit the block and shoot me some craps
