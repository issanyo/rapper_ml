Check, this time our side get what we deserve
Niggas murk for fun, trying us? You got a nerve
I know dope cookers out of cars, remixing keys
Serving two-a-days, flipping, making double G's
Niggas going to the feds in my stomping grounds
Quarter mills or better, nigga we don't play around
We just play with bands, but if you play with mine
That's just another homicide on the Northside
