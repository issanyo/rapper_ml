Young nigga feeling like 2pac
Pull up to the scene in a new drop
Walk in the booth like "Who hot"?
Put 10 racks in the shoe box
Put 10 racks in the shoe box
Put 10 racks in the shoe box
Put 10 racks in the shoe box, young nigga

[Verse 1]
Looking for a shawty like Kehlani
I'ma fold her up like origami
State that shit like Gandhi
And I got a whole squad behind me
Running through the north with my woes
Running through the north with the squad
Bitches it's slum season (slum season)
Bitch you gotta know we go hard
I'ma work the fucking grave up
Money on me, hold up
Money on me, hold up
20 racks, 50 racks, good god
Tell Kiki she could come see me
On the beach with a bitch named DiDi
Bad bitch set it up like a [?]
But she ain't worth shit like a city
Ain't nothing really moving but the money
Ain't nothing really moving but the cash
Ain't nothing really moving but a bitch in the flame checking ass
I'm just tryna throw the bay
I'm a north side nigga 'till the end
From a game, watching 'round with the trends
I'm in LA rocking with a fan
Either way I go it, nigga go and win

[Verse 2]
Walk up in the booth like I own it cause I do
Who are you? I'm the new
You a fluke, I'm the motherfucking truth
Pull up to the club in a motherfucking coup√©
Hop out like ooh, {?]
Any given day, I can tell the boy shoo
But we nod on that cause we focus on the lou
Focus on the loo, this bitch like ooh
Riding around, no roof, he a motherfucking foo'
Young nigga gotta make it burn like [?]
Young, young sauce with the [?]
Bitch you know its mine if you see a nigga in it
Real nigga, day 1, ain't with the gimmicks
Threw it in the box and it look like 10
Bought her home fine and it look like friends
Threw it in the box and it look like 20
Say one of things for a nigga, how many
