[Intro: Tha Joker]
Dear Heavenly Father. We have gathered here for one reason and one reason only. To get that show money. And now that I got that in my back pocket, we can focus on some other things. First of all, I would like to say Jesus thank you for bringing us here safely. And thank you for having such a whole tivity turn out. Lord Jesus, I like to pray for Big Fruit, that he make it out of here safely. 'Cuz he might slap a ho if she don't give up her number. Wooh! Hallelujah. One second, He is touching me right now, He is touching me right now. Pause for the show money. I just wanna say, I hope we turn up on all these bitch man niggas. And I hope they all see us in our glory and want to hate until they die one day
