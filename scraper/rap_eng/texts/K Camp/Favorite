[Chorus: T. Mills]
I got a lot of bitches, girl, but you my favorite
I got all this money I'ma let you play with
California King, I'ma let you lay in
I got a lot of bitches, girl, but you my favorite

[Verse 1: T. Mills]
She roll a blunt and I face it
We pour it up, no chaser
She don't shop at no Macy's
I swear to God, she ain't basic
I got a lot of other girls, but this girl is my favorite
All I do is say the word, and she gon' get butt naked
Start in the shower, we took to the counter
We ended up back on the mattress
No need to audition, she say she a model
But to me she look like an actress
And that's where I eat it she go to kitchen to make me a sandwich
That pussy so good, I guess she the meanest

[Chorus: T. Mills]
I got a lot of bitches, girl, but you my favorite
I got all this money I'ma let you play with
California King, I'ma let you lay in
I got a lot of bitches, girl, but you my favorite
Favorite, favorite, my favorite, favorite, oh
Favorite, favorite, my favorite, favorite, oh
Favorite, favorite, my favorite, favorite, oh
Favorite, favorite, my favorite, favorite, oh

[Verse 2: Ty Dolla $ign]
She's my favorite, yeah

OG, I'm like, "yeah"
Rodeo, she like, "yeah"
Yayo, she like, "yeah"
This one, she like, "yeah"

She ain't even trippin' on these little bitches cause they know she got it
In the streets she bossin'
In the bed, she naughty
Get her wetter than a waterfall then fuck her all night off the Molly

[Chorus: T. Mills]
I got a lot of bitches, girl, but you my favorite
I got all this money I'ma let you play with
California King, I'ma let you lay in

[Verse 3: Lunchmoney Lewis]
She my favorite, yeah

We got a bond, yeah
And we never break it, no
She want that liquor
You know I'ma chase it, yeah
She only want drugs and party
I facilitate it, yeah
She come back with bags, I come back with cash
You know that's the mission
I worship that body, I pray for you mommy
And eat my religion
I sent her an Uber to meet at the condo
I sent her a text that said, "Meet at the Tabo[?]"

[Chorus: T. Mills]
I got a lot of bitches, girl, but you my favorite
I got all this money I'ma let you play with
California King, I'ma let you lay in
I got a lot of bitches, girl, but you my favorite
Favorite, favorite, my favorite, favorite, oh
Favorite, favorite, my favorite, favorite, oh
Favorite, favorite, my favorite, favorite, oh
Favorite, favorite, my favorite, favorite, oh

[Verse 4: K CAMP]
K now look...
You just kill 'em when you 'posed to
Swag just raw, no tofu
Stacked like Pro-Tools
You know I'm the nigga that she go to
We gon' Power Up, like Goku
Nigga, what the cash like?
She can move with the bad, right?
ATL-LA, that celeb flight
Mix the Hen with the Coke, that's a great night
She don't know what a bad day feel like
I know one thing, she killing the scene
Turn up whenever you hit it
She all about cream, she living the dream
She don't deal with niggas that's petty
All on that gin, yeah, let me between
I'm tryn'a go deep if you let me
She killing the scene, that body so mean
Walking right out those Bezides[?]

[Chorus: T. Mills]
I got a lot of bitches, girl, but you my favorite

California King, I'ma let you lay in
I got a lot of bitches, girl, but you my favorite
Favorite, favorite, my favorite, favorite, oh

Favorite, favorite, my favorite, favorite, oh
Favorite, favorite, my favorite, favorite, oh
