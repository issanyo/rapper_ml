[Intro]
Look you knew I wasn't shit
You know I ain't shit
You still my homie though

[Verse: 1]
You hate the fact I'm on the road
You know that's where that money at
You always bitching when I'm gone
But smiling when I bring it back
Complaining bout them other bitches
Cos they ain't worried bout you
Them other bitches temporary
But if you act up you too
Don't act like you don't know that shit
Act like you don't know that shit we be on that other shit
Any time you come around
No matter who you fucking with we be on that fucking shit
So turn that ass around turn that ass around
Turn that ass around yeah yeah
And let me put it down while I'm here in town
Every time you round I just tell you that..

If you fuck with me like I fuck with you
You know the truth (you know)
I know you solid, you know I'm solid
Let's break the rules
But she doing too much, we doing too much

You just wanna argue play around with mixed emotions
And I ain't got the patience cos a young nigga focused
