Pull up to the scene like yea yea

We can make it work, girl you just need faith

Came right at the wrong time
Fuck the other nigga girl you all mine
Make sure you cut off your phone line
Don’t let em interfere with our time, our time

Fuck around and have my babies
Lookin like Janet from the 80’s yea yea, Yea
