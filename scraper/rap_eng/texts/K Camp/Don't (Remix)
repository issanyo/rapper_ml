[Verse 1]
Shawty I'm the man
Really ain't trying to hear shit about the other guy
Nah for real
I really ain't trying to hear shit about that nigga
Gotta understand (Yeah)
You know that I, came to supply
Pull up on 14th, just jump in the ride (Skrt)
Yes, it's a foreign, please don't act surprised
She know my status and I'm on the rise
How would you feel if we fucked in this party?
Pull out my IPhone and start the recording
Kiss on the pussy, the end of the story
She telling me to go deeper, deeper
Slide in that pussy no Visa, she's a
Wild one that I gotta hold up
Lame niggas never get no love
Fucked in the lamb with the doors up
Now shawty walking with her nose up
When it comes to relationships, I know I can't hold on
It might come off selfish, rather chase money, baby I'm gone (Yeah, Yeah)
It can't be no other way
Was talking to my ex just the other day
It's crazy how the love just fade away (mhm)
But I cannot trip, I got a grip
Called my new shorty, enjoyed them lips
Called up my jeweler, ordered the wrist
Full of them diamonds, I can't resist (no,no,no,no)
Know a few bitches that traded on me
How the fuck you going try to play the homie
How the fuck you going try to play the homie
Pocket full of cheese, that's Macaroni
I done ran it up now them bitches on me
I-I done ran it up now them bitches on me (Yeah)
These niggas running with the style now (take a number)
Been doing this for awhile now
They want the rest of me, gave em the recipe (facts)
I don't know why but the Lord keep on blessing me (Thank you Lord)
Can't figure out why your bitch keep stressing me
Without a doubt bet that money stay next to me
I'm getting paid right now, (Yeah, Yeah)
Money parade right now, (Yeah, Yeah)
Hid in the shade right now, (Oh Yeah)
You are afraid right now (Yeah, Yeah)
I will not stop until I get the chair
I know you niggas, y'all hear me out there
They know the shit that I put out is flame
I am King Slum remember the name
I am King Slum remember the name
I said I am King Slum remember the name

[Outro]
Yeah (Slum Caesar, Slum Caesar)
You welcome
