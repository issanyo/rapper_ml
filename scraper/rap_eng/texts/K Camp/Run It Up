[Intro:K Camp]
Slum!
You welcome

[Verse 1: K Camp]

All my niggas tryna slum, Hold my nuts just like a plum
Watch me beat like a drum, Rub the pussy with my thumb
Hit the block and set it off , So Alfredo with the Sauce
6 piece and a cross , [?] like dolph
[?]
King slum my facati,Ride it better than andres
Fuck her till we both sweaty
Shawty rocking Tom Ford,Whole squad in one car
Count 100s til im Bored,Smoke a blunt or blow water
Rapper weed and a louie ,Light it up and bought the fugis
Funny that you thought you knew me,You don't like a nigga sue me
Cheese, eggs with the grapes,Turkey bacon with the Juice
Got her whippin in the kitchen,While lil shawty break lose
Whip Whip work you wrist,How ima fuck if you insist
Gas station out of Sprite, Dirty in Sierra Mist
Watch it float too the bottom,All my Niggas from the bottom
You don't really wanna problem
Love it when the money pilin'
I dont really like rappers ,They dont really like me
I can make a bitch famous,Kiss her in front of TMZ
Lookin like A cup of Tea
Baby its just you and me
Shawty say that pussy locked
But I got the Master Key
Slum

[Outro]
Well i got the master key
