[Verse 1]
Smoking blunts at the mansion tryna figure it out
Caught you rap niggas still tryna figure me out
Yeah we witness it too and we dishing it out
Still fussing with my ex, what you bitching about?
I'm the nigga got 2 motherfuckers turnt off something
Riding down Lyric Ave, good head in the Hummer
Why your favourite artist tryna dip up in my bag?
I know I'm coming with the wave know you boys can't have
But look, the lil shit ain't nothing to me, I love the pressure
Stack of 100s and gold wrappers still on the dresser
Louis luggage for bad bitches that wanna swim
Snapchat me that pussy bitch, I'm one of them
Steady working, I never move if it ain't worth it
Clocked in from 10 AM to 11:30
Shawty said she wanna fuck, passed her to the buddy
If it ain't hand in my cup, then that bitch muddy
These niggas tryna slow me down, oh no
Fuck that, got a joint at winners circle, shout out KD
Steph Curry with the shot, please don't play me
Draymond and my dog, Monday AOD
Bring the hoe back to Lyric, never check IDs
Packed up tut down, smoking that OG
Shawty pop what you want, please don't OD

[Verse 2]
Shit crazy, I done turned into my favourite rapper
Send them things in the mail, bust 'em through the wrapper
I been working like a junkie with a sign
I be damned if a pussy nigga think he taking mine
I am not a rapper, I'm a preacher, get it right
Standing at the altar, giving lessons every night
Flying first class, they gon' hate me every flight
Cause I'm smelling like the pack and my jewellery real bright
Touch down, touch down, touch down
Keep a bad bitch every time I touch down
She can fuck whoever when the boy not around
I ain't tryna cuff you up, throw you in the lost and found
Yo and I ain't really with the [?]
Fuck police nigga, black lives matter
Well all lives matter, water whipping up the platter
That's lasagna with the crab, drop the fish in the batter
I know some big dogs hating on me
I'm just tryna drop hits, fans waiting on me
I'm just tryna go on tour, sell it out
Yeah my label still playing, feel like niggas bailing out
It don't really matter cause a nigga wins all
10 toes down, bitch I send my wings up
Niggas that I helped, put on and shitted on me
Don't matter, Lyric Ave on way, we did it homie
