[Intro: K Camp]
This is for all the motherfuckers hating
For all the pussy niggas that's mad, I'm winning
I dedicate this to you

[Verse 1: K Camp]
Livin' my life like there ain't no limits
Brand new Bugatti you can see me in it
Black Mazarati with the windows tinted
Don’t mind me baby I'm just ventin’
Catch this vibe hey, catch this vibe
When it's all done just know I tried
Going all in, reppin' for my side
I can't tell you the last time I cried
I know they see a nigga on the XXL
You niggas competition well I can't tell
Ya boy checking in like a damn hotel
For ones still sleeping I'ma give 'em hell
Never ever ever bite the hand that feeds ya
Lately I been feeling unappreciated
Lately I been feeling like I do too much
Now a nigga winning now I can see they hating
Swear it all changed when the money came
Salute to my niggas that stayed the same
How you sell your soul for a taste of fame
Look at all this shit that I overcame
North side nigga all in Dubai
Overseas trapping with ya bitch no lie
Big bad wolf you can hear my cry
Momma told me I got to lose that pride
Momma told me I gotta shit on niggas
Awl man I can see the bitch in niggas
To the white man I'm a richer nigga
Dope boys whipping in the kitchen nigga
Ain't no telling what I just might do
Nigga pay attention I am not like you
Smarter than you think check my I.Q
Married to the game baby yes, I do
Gotta stay humble even though they want me to fumble
Sorry this is how the cookie crumble
Young nigga came from the jungle
Ion even want your bitch number
Ion even want your bitch time
Nigga I'ma claim what's mine
Nigga I'm a king standing right next to the sun
Best believe bitch I'ma shine ho
I won't let them stop my grind, no
You met a nigga like my kind, no
This shit written in the stars
Just pay attention to the signs ho
Know who I'm better than
Smoking medicine fuck it nigga let'em in
I'm a motherfucking beast you can tell a friend
Worldwide and the streets still fuck with him

[Outro: K Camp]
K Way
Don't call me K Camp no more
Address me as K Way
Or King of the Slum
Talk to 'em
