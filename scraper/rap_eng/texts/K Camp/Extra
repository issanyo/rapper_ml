[Chorus: Lil Lonnie]
All these hoes bein' extra, she won't leave when I tell her
Don't know why she feel special, I got right and then I left her
Show her friends when I text her, man I swear this bitch is extra
I don't know why she so extra
All I know is that these bitches, they be extra, extra, extra
These hoes, they be extra, extra, extra
She do whatever you let her, let her, let her
This shit here gettin' extra, extra, extra

[Verse 1: Lil Lonnie]
Tell my why are you so extra girl, you know you do the most
You be pullin' to the spot and tryna show off for the bros
Get on IG in your feelings, making stupid ass posts
Once I hit you I dismiss you, send your ass right out the door
You tell all your friends your business, swear you are so independent
You always bug a nigga and you always penny pinching
You be gettin' on my nerves, I hate that me and you did it
You so extra but you think you special, ho you need to quit it

[Chorus: Lil Lonnie]
All these hoes bein' extra, she won't leave when I tell her
Don't know why she feel special, I got right and then I left her
Show her friends when I text her, man I swear this bitch is extra
I don't know why she so extra
All I know is that these bitches, they be extra, extra, extra
These hoes, they be extra, extra, extra
She do whatever you let her, let her, let her
This shit here gettin' extra, extra, extra

[Verse 2: K Camp]
I got hoes I don't love, I just fuck 'em then I dip
I can't trust that lil bitch, that's why I keep it on the hip
Venice Gucci top to bottom, told that bitch to catch my drip
Shawty know that she ain't uno, that's the reason why I skip
Spent a grip on these pants, that's the reason why I flex
Brand new diamonds make 'em dance, it's a party on my neck
Give me sex, plenty hoes, I ain't pressed
Ayy Lil Lonnie, tell them hoes come correct (hey), Way

[Chorus: Lil Lonnie]
All these hoes bein' extra, she won't leave when I tell her
Don't know why she feel special, I got right and then I left her
Show her friends when I text her, man I swear this bitch is extra
I don't know why she so extra
All I know is that these bitches, they be extra, extra, extra
These hoes, they be extra, extra, extra
She do whatever you let her, let her, let her
This shit here gettin' extra, extra, extra
