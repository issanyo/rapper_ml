[Hook: x4]
You're looking at a star, make a wish
Top down, ridin with yo' bitch
Money on me, that's a zip
Nigga hate but it don't mean shit

[Verse 1:]
Top down, riding with yo' bitch
Big in the city, no crib
I'm all in her mouth like spit
You know a nigga Will, I'm like Smith
Come for that Henny, understandin'
Fly like a hot new wheel
Get more neck than a bill
Independent crown, what's the deal?
Open that thing like a letter
Tuck mo' cash than the teller
The bitch steady busting like berettas
In that cut, bad boy know better
And the kush got a nigga paranoid
Steady lookin out for the boys
Nigga this a hit, no Floyd
Ya'll niggas ain't makin no noise

[Hook: x4]
You're looking at a star, make a wish
Top down, ridin with yo' bitch
Money on me, that's a zip
Nigga hate but it don't mean shit

[Verse 2:]
Hate but it don't mean shit
Nigga I ain't worried about you
I'm the new thing on the scene
I should be worried bout who?
This shit started as a dream
Now a nigga hot like soup
Aye nigga what you mean?
Play that thing a holiday like true
Fuck it boy I'm living it
I need a couple days, I'll be out here
She heard I'm too cool like Snoop
And the bitch wanna drop it like it's hot
Boy I be everything that you're not
See yo bitch getting lower than the squad
Girl you know you fucking with a winner
The price going up like stocks

[Hook: x4]
You're looking at a star, make a wish
Top down, ridin with yo' bitch
Money on me, that's a zip
Nigga hate but it don't mean shit
