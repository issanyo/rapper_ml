[Verse 2: True Story Gee]
Yeah, came in this bitch with the gang
Five thousand on the chain

Countin' money, make it rain
Might hit the Flame, make it rain, yeah
Drip (Drip), yeah, you ain't even gotta strip
Throw the ones then dip
Bitch my neck on freeze
Sippin' pure codeine
Fuck a ho, she go to sleep
Uber her then Uber Eats
My lil' ho ain't over me
Keep that glizzy close to me
She say that I'm actin' different
She can't even notice me
Act like I don't fuck with her
Bitch that wasn't sober me

[Verse 3: Lil Durk]
We done sold junkies the woop
Bitches don't honor the truth
Got head in a Canada Goose
Perc-30's be settin' 'em, ooh
Don't play with me, play with a fool
Got brothers that play with the food
Some be takin' the shrooms
Some shit you able to do (Yeah)
And my neck fully too
Won't fuck a bitch wearin' Fruity Looms
When you act broke, you'll blow the mood
Diamonds on my chain control the room
Louis Vuitton handbag for the blues
Fuck once, put her name on the room
Want money and the fame with it too
Should've put your name on the news

[Chorus: K Camp]
Wrist hootie-hoo (Hoo), neck fully too (Fully)
Coupe Scooby Doo (Hurr), that ho just a swoop (Swoop)
Truck Dually too (Truck), rings hula hoop (Hoop)
You out the loop (Out), you scared to shoot (Shoot)
I'm 'bout that loot (Yes), I'm with my troops (Yes)
I got the juice (Yes), I feel like Zeus (Yes)
I will not snooze (I), bought some brand new jewels (Jewels)
I got shit to do (Do), I got shit to lose (Lose)
