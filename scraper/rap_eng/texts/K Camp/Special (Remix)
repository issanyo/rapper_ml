Put the lil bitch on my schedule (schedule)

Still got this money on I, spent a lil check on my flight
Your bitch want a turn cause she heard I'm a hell of a guy (ayy)
She want me for the wrong reason (ayy)
Wanna fuck for the wrong reasons (ayy)
And I ain't even gon' argue with you
Baby T-ing up 'cause it's dome season
Smoking green like I gone vegan
Shout out my nigga Lil Lonnie (Lil Lonnie)
I hit her once then I change my number
Now my old hoes, they can't find me
I got my squad and they all right behind me
Smoking that kiler, I move like a zombie
Spazzing on niggas, so cool and kindly
I fell like Clyde, I'm looking for Bonnie
Haha, gotta treat these dog hoes all the same
She just wanna fuck a nigga off his name

[Chorus: Lil Lonnie & K Camp]
No relations baby, I ain't tryna settle
Yeah you bad but that shit don't make you special
These hoes'll tell you anything, you gotta be careful
She wanna smash, gotta fit her in my schedule (yeah yeah yeah yeah)
