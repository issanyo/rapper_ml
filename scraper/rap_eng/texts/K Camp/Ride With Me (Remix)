[Verse 1: RJ]
You niggas sound like me now
Still got my plug on speed dial
Called so many shots, I re-dialed
Blat-that! Ring out
Snitch nigga pussy, a meow
Shoot a nigga bitch like a rebound
Ol' I wanna be down
Screw face cause I'm on the scene now
Fiend choke a nigga out before he get beat down
Leave a nigga body where nobody
Second look 'em, fish hook 'em, only way he get feezound
You niggas taking deals to reduce time
You told police about your plug out in Tucson
Your old homies don't fuck with you cause you too hot
See niggas like you be the reasons hoods be two sides
Oh, run and hide, nigga, patience a virtue
That paperwork got niggas ready to murk you
My lil' nigga kept it solid, did a 5 to 9
I wish a lawyer for all my niggas that's fighting time
(On God)

[Hook: RJ]
Niggas wanna shine with me
But they won't do the time with me
Snitches throw they time to me
That's why I always ride lowkey
I didn't want a dime on me
Snitches through they time to me
That's why I always ride lowkey
Gotta keep the fire on me

[Verse 2: YG]
I'm riding dirty on the L-O
Cause the judge giving niggas body parts, elbows
So I paid fifteen hundred for my stash spot
This janky dude, you fuck with it, it'll pop out
Ooh, I got a strike and a felony
But the homie riding with me say his record clean
So you would take this case is what you telling me?
Ooh, you better not tell on me
You went to jail for a lick and came home too quick
And you wonder why your homeboys never wanna tell you shit
But we wasn't too sure so the homie still let 'em lurk
'Til niggas saw that paperwork
Told the D.A., "He was the driver, he plotted, he did it, he even threatened to fuck me up if I wasn't with it"
Now it's all bad in the hood and he can't come around
Conversations like, "Something, something, gun that nigga down"

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Nipsey Hussle]
I made it through my situation and I stayed down
For niggas muggin it's nothing much you can say now
I'm so accustomed to sucka' niggas that hate now
I pokerface and then touch 'em, my niggas play foul
It ain't no rules cause these niggas threw the rules away
If I could pick a place and time I would choose today
See I'm the type of nigga die for his jewelry
Gang related homicide is what the news'll say
Playing with my reputation ain't amusing me
Playing with a nigga patience who are you to say
Short temper, fuck it, I'ma blow a fuse today
And when I lose my mind I'ma shoot a face
I seen 'em get away with murder cause he knew the way
Killed a nigga, went to trial, then he beat the case
So what type of example do it set, nigga
Play with mine, you can fuckin' get wet nigga
Yes, nigga

[Hook]

[Verse 4: K Camp]
I keep the fire on me, like a motherfuckin' BIC
She just want my balls, I just gotta throw the pitch
Fiending for the cash, I just got a slight itch
365 grind, yeah we runnin' in this bitch (hey)
I don't fuck around with a snake nigga, no, no
Fuck how you feel, nigga, I just want the bankroll
Riding with the fire on me
Master with the shit, no P
Hoes watching me like Glee
It ain't hard to see you on a beat
(Camp!)
