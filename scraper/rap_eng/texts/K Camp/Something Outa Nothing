[Pre-Hook]
Tryna make somethin' out of nothin'
Tryna make somethin' out of nothin'
Just a young nigga tryna make somethin' out of nothin'
Tryna make somethin' out of nothin'
Just a young nigga tryna make somethin' out of nothin'
Tryna make somethin' out of nothin'
Just a young nigga tryna make somethin' out of nothin'

[Verse 1]
Struggles in the past and I made a transition
Started with a mic then I turned it to a vision
In the driver's seat, keys in the ignition
Boy I'm tryna ball on you bitches, Skylar Diggins
Ain't no way around it, I'm the problem and solution
Gettin' it, if you wanna know what I'm doin'
Only talkin' beef when you boys barbecuin'
Know some real niggas posted on the block, Patrick Ewing
Step by step, I ain't got nothin' left
Been learned the game, I don't need no ref
Nigga too funny, AKA Mike Epps
All I know is work like my young nigga Chef

[Refrain]
Made it out the mud, yeah we got it out the trenches
'Member them days we were jumpin' over fences
They can stop who but his grind is relentless
All I see is paper like I'm sittin' in detention

[Pre-Hook]

[Hook]
Just a young nigga tryna make somethin' out of nothin'
Tryna make somethin' out of nothin'
Just a young nigga tryna make somethin' out of nothin'
Tryna make somethin' out of nothin'
Just a young nigga tryna make somethin' out of nothin'
Tryna make somethin' out of nothin'
Just a young nigga tryna make somethin' out of nothin'

[Verse 2]
I ain't really worried 'bout none of you niggas
Not at all, fuck around, start sonnin' you niggas
Yeah I'm talkin' to the plug, that's frontin' you niggas
Runnin' off with the sound, there's a ton of you niggas
Nigga it's a movie every time that I do it
If I don't know nothin' else, bitch I get to it
Came here to ball, yeah I will [?]
She gon' give me neck, lil bitch, just crew it
Young nigga tryna get a piece of the pie
Reppin' that 4 like the month of July
Ho hit me up, no need to reply
She ain't show me love when my pockets was dry
