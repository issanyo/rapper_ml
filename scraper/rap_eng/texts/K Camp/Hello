[Intro: Kent Jones & Yo Gotti]
Dem Boyz!
We The Best, you the worse
You got heel with the nigga when we talkin' loud
Been a minute, gettin' money, still winnin', now I'm to it

[Hook: Kent Jones]
I'm like that right, she must be from the street
She got a story for every man she meet
And man I swear I fuck her and I fell in love for real, fell in love for real
I think she leavin' with me and she know the deal, fell in love for real
Oh-oh, I think I met her in the club
Oh-oh, I know she never get enough
Oh-oh, she got a bigger at too much
Oh where I get her touch, that's a touch

[Bridge: Kent Jones]
I already know what's going on in your head
Better pop my mind, get in my bed
She crazy not to make me run away
But the pussy makin' a mil on a stay

[Hook: Kent Jones]
I'm like that right, she must be from the street
She got a story for every man she meet
I'm like that right, I know she from the street
I see you lookin' through your lights up in your seat
And man I swear I fuck her and I fell in love for real, fell in love for real
I think she leavin' with me and she know the deal, fell in love for real

[Verse 2: Ty Dolla $ign]

Damn right, damn, damn, damn Dolla let her pay
Damn right, damn, damn, we be fuckin' all night
I'mma pull up in [?], I'mma let her like my pre-roll
I'mma let her taste my ego, I'mma let her taste my ego
I'mma go cop some Saint Laurent, I'mma cop us some Saint Laurent
I'mma gon' got some Gucci, I'mma got price on Gucci

[Hook: Kent Jones]
I'm like that right, she must be from the street
She got a story for every man she meet
I'm like that right, I know she from the street
I see you lookin' through your lights up in your seat
And man I swear I fuck her and I fell in love for real, fell in love for real
I think she leavin' with me and she know the deal, fell in love for real
Oh-oh, I think I met her in the club
Oh-oh, I know she never get enough
Oh-oh, she got a bigger at too much
Oh where I get her touch, that's a touch

[Verse 3: Yo Gotti]
I can see it in your eyes you went through shit (yea-yea)

Shoes on point, she's exclusive (yea-yea)
Ye gettin' money in [?] (yea-yea)
I'm lookin' in her eyes, she [?]
If you get P-Game, you're close (nigga)
Got a peep game, got a sea ship, shawty game tights, only screen shit
We ain't get her [?], speakin' body language
From the same world, we gon' [?]
Froze low about three levels, in a OG it's all tryna tell us
Hit the band, bitch gotta stay solid
And a real nigga is gotta do double

[Hook: Kent Jones]
I'm like that right, she must be from the street
She got a story for every man she meet
I'm like that right, I know she from the street
I see you lookin' through your lights up in your seat

[Verse 4: K Camp]
Shawty's too much, shawty's too much
Shawty's too much for a nigga like me
Might lay she down, burn bad Louis V
Can I blow a check then fuck you on the beach?
Don't do too much (don't do too much)
You wanna fuck for a nigga like me
I turn the pussy, gettin' head in the G (skurr)
Nigga what you say? I'm gettin' bread  in my sleep
Want it from me, spend love in three levels
OG is always tryna tell us
And the bad bitches gotta stay solid
And the real nigga is gotta do better
I'mma buy you everything for real
Just promise you always keep it real

[Hook: Kent Jones]
I'm like that right, she must be from the street
She got a story for every man she meet
I'm like that right, I know she from the street
I see you lookin' through your lights up in your seat
And man I swear I fuck her and I fell in love for real, fell in love for real
I think she leavin' with me and she know the deal, fell in love for real

[Outro: K Camp]
Want it from me, spend love in three levels
OG is always tryna tell us
And the bad bitches gotta stay solid
And the real nigga is gotta do better
I'mma buy you everything for real
Just promise you always keep it real
Fuck that nigga, Henn' the shit he feel
Legs up in the foreign then let's spill
