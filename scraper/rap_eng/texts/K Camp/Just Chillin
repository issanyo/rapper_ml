[Intro: GENIUS]
ID, ayy this real plug music
Bunch of, bunch of, bunch of
Bunch of RARE shit goin' on, hey

[Chorus: GENIUS]
Chillin'
Countin' up this money, I'm just livin'
Laid up with your bitch, boy we just chillin'
She keeps showin' pics of all your children
Put it on her face, don't want no children
Lately I been tryna find my feelings
I can't find no ho to give these feelings
Might as well go lay up with my millions
She ask me what we doin', I'm just chillin'

[Verse 1: K Camp]
Haha, look, chillin'
Hope you know this dick ain't come with feelings
My lil' bitch so special, that my lil' one
Hand the size of stars all in my ceiling
Don't care what they think, you a real one
No lacking, please say hello to the villain
I don't love you, but I do love all these millions
Stick that tongue out, maybe you can meet my children

[Chorus: GENIUS & K Camp]
Countin' up this money, I'm just livin' (Okay)
Laid up with your bitch, boy we just chillin' (Okay)
She keeps showin' pics of all your children (Okay)
Put it on her face, don't want no children (Okay)
Lately I been tryna find my feelings (Okay)
I can't find no ho to give these feelings
Might as well go lay up with my millions
She ask me what we doin', I'm just chillin'

[Verse 2: True Story Gee]
Brand new Rollie flooded
Can't wait to see my ex in public
Nigga don't hit my phone up
Got no verse, you ain't got no budget
I just want some top from you lil' shawty
You ain't gotta button up
Might just get that Maybach off the lot
No you I ain't gon' hurt for nothin'
Louis V my latest kicks
Yeah your pussy good but I can't lay up, I can't babysit
Plus your baby daddy broke and dusty, know you hate that shit
Show you shit you ain't never seen
Codeine and promethazine
You probably pray I don't never leave

[Chorus: GENIUS & True Story Gee]
Chillin' (Ooh)
Countin' up this money, I'm just livin' (Countin' up this money)
Laid up with your bitch, boy we just chillin' (Laid up with your)
She keeps showin' pics of all your children
Put it on her face, don't want no children (Want no children)
Lately I been tryna find my feelings (Woo, woo)
I can't find no ho to give these feelings
Might as well go lay up with my millions (Woo, lay up)
She ask me what we doin', I'm just chillin' (Yeah)
Chillin'
