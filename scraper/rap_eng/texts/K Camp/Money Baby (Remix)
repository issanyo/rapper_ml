[Hook: K-Camp]
I like smoking weed, I like getting fly
I like having sex, I like girls who ride
I like my cup full, I like turning up
I like brand new shit so this is what I love the most
I like that money baby, money baby, money baby
Money baby, money baby, money baby
Gotta have that money baby, money baby, money baby
Thats that shit I like (oh, oh)

[Verse 1 - Chinx]
Shawty on that weed, I be on ciroc
She on her way in, you on your way out
Half a fifth of Gin, drink away the problems
Weezy 500 degrees, semi auto-choppas
Dope as I'm is, they gon' have to back me up
Niggas switch em score some cars
Fuck nigga now we up
None these hoes gon' tie me down
Niggas smoking Bobby Brown
Over seas, count cheese, where you niggas find me now
I spent three days on that batch
That's your bitch I'll bring her back
Head spinning nigga dizzy, I ran circles in that trap
I can smell them M's, nigga we ain't stoppin'
Kicking they doors in, nigga we ain't knockin'

[Hook: K-Camp]

I like that money baby, money baby, money baby
Money baby, money baby, money baby
Gotta have that money baby, money baby, money baby
Thats that shit I like (oh, oh)

[Verse 2 - French Montana]
Busting down, Rollie you can tell time on it
Ain't no fuck nigga, watch me style on 'em
Put a hundred on your hat, call you bank head
And you can dock a yacht, on a tank head
Money baby, Teterboro flights to Opa-Locka
Been turning to the max, shout to Wavy Crockett
When they come to the V's gotta car lot
Hit Chinx I need a hundred g's, I'm in Far Rock
Get the two dogs for when I piss her off
Don't get too close, walk around with the pistol loaded
Been getting money like a car (Haaan!)
Coke boys, ten meals on the diner line
