[Chorus: Jack Harlow & K Camp]
A whole new ten that I can lay down with
Sent the pic to me, told her that she look astoundin'
Walked in and she caught the down wind
And she like the way I'm well-rounded
Don't talk too much, if I'm honest with you, might be off too much
Brrp, brrp, prrp, prrp
Shawty pick your phone up
Pick your phone up, pick your phone up, yeah
Let's go, wooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Shawty pick your phone up
Pick that phone up for your boy
She want the boy 'cause I'm feeling outstandin'
Buy her a bag 'cause I'm feeling romantic
Skkrt-Skkrt, watch that Rari do damage
I made her turn up her standards, let's go

[Verse 1: K Camp]
You know that I'm tryna' dive in you
His and her coups, watch me glide with you
Roll up that wood and get high with you
Stay 1-K, ain't no surprise with you
Hit my line when you want that lumber
Shawty you been high and I'ma catch you in the summer
Turn a fifty-plate into a a-hundred, ain't no fumbles
Your ex said he ballin', but he got no jumper
Shout my boy Harlow
Racks in my cargo
Mills on my mind, I'ma get that tomorrow
Back in the day, used to whip Monte Carlos
Shout my boy Bobby, shout my boy Harvo

[Chorus: Jack Harlow & K Camp]
A whole new ten that I can lay down with
Sent the pic to me, told her that she look astoundin'
Walked in and she caught the down wind
And she like the way I'm well-rounded
Don't talk too much, if I'm honest with you, might be off too much
I banged one too much
I was off the liquor when I called you up
Brrp, brrp, prrp, prrp
Shawty pick your phone up
Pick your phone up, pick your phone up, yeah
Let's go, wooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Shawty pick your phone up
Pick that phone up for your boy
She want the boy 'cause I'm feeling outstandin'
Buy her a bag 'cause I'm feeling romantic

[Verse 2: Jack Harlow]
I feel like Drizzy on "Ransom"
Me and her fuck like we stranded
Don't know what the strand is
It was handed to me and I don't know whose hand it is
Only take it if it's candid
I don't wanna' pose for you, I won't be commanded
Moving like a bandit
I am not enrolled, but a youngin' on campus
She gon' let me hit it and I'm headed to Atlantis
At the pool party lookin' like I'm Pete Sampras
I don't miss no image, I ain't mean to come home so friendly
In the morning maybe we can do Denny's
I wanted Cracker Barrel, but you know it gets busy

[Chorus: Jack Harlow & K Camp]
A whole new ten that I can lay down with
Sent the pic to me, told her that she look astoundin'
Walked in and she caught the down wind
And she like the way I'm well-rounded
Don't talk too much, if I'm honest with you, might be off too much
I banged one too much
I was off the liquor when I called you up
Brrp, brrp, prrp, prrp
Shawty pick your phone up
Pick your phone up, pick your phone up, yeah
Let's go, wooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Shawty pick your phone up
Pick that phone up for your boy
She want the boy 'cause I'm feeling outstandin'
Buy her a bag 'cause I'm feeling romantic
Skkrt-Skkrt, watch that Rari do damage
I made her turn up her standards, let's go
