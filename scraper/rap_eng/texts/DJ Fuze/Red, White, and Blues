Red, white, and blues, waving in the wind
From the East, to the West, to the North, to the Southside
Tears falling down endlessly
The news turned sorrow, to fear, to anger
Eliminate reason, and people turn faceless
You could say we were losing
‘Cause they were stealing our lives that day
But there’s still no conclusion
‘Cause so many die, everywhere, every day
In a way, even if we’re winning, we’re all losing
It’s a state of emergency
All around I see

[Chorus]
Red, white, and blues
If you don’t claim them, they’ll blame you
Red, and white, and blues
United who stands for the truth

[Guitar solo]

Red, white, and blues
Red, white, and blues
