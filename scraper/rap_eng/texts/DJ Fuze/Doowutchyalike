[Hook]
Ooh, I see guys and girls dancing, ooh, ooh

[Verse 1]
[Shock G]
Now as the record spins around, you recognize this sound
Well, it's the Underground
You know that we're down with what you like
Yeah, with what you like, yeah
[Humpty Hump]
And though we're usually on the serious tip, check it out:
Tonight we're gonna flip and trip and let it all hang out tonight
We're gonna say what we like
[Shock G and Money B]
Cause, yo, yo, we wanna know how many people in the flow
Would like to just let yourselves go
And do what you like
Yeah, well tonight's your night
[S.G.] Just eat food, try not to be crude or rude
Kill the attitude, chill the serious mood
And do what you like
Yeah, and doowutchyalike
Everybody doowutchyalike

[Hook]

[S.G.] I mean rich, poor, high, low, or upper-middle class
Let's all get together and have a few laughs
And do what we like
Yeah, and do what we like, yeah, and do what we like
And since you came here you gotta show and prove
And do that dance, until it don't move
Do what you like
Sometimes I bite
[H.H.] Now if you're hungry, get yourself something to eat
And if you're dirty, then go take a bath
Messed up the line?
Nope, sometimes I don't rhyme
Help yourself to a cracker, with a spread of cheddar cheese
Have a neck bone, you don't have to say please
Eat what you like, yo, smell how you like
Everybody doowutchyalike

[Hook]

[S.G.] Just act a fool, it's okay if you drool
Cause everybody's gonna strip, and jump in the pool
And do what we like, yeah, and do what we like
[H.H.] Homegirls, for once, forget you got class
See a guy you like: just grab 'im in the biscuits!
And do what you like
[S.G.] Now, red, white, black, tan, yellow, or brown
It really doesn't matter, we can all get down
And do what we like, yeah, and do what we like
From a pink-skinned Yankee, to a blue-black Southerner
Ditch digger or a governor
Just do what you like
Look how you like
[H.H.] Now don't you know we're getting busy, it can't be corrected
Shake it, had to be def
I say what I like
Like I said, sometimes we bite
Even though you don't think it's right
Yo, I like to bite
Just have fun y'all, and if you think that it's wrong
You got to admit, it's a new type of song
Doowutchyalike

[Hook]

[S.G.] Alright, here we go, y'all:
Do what you like
Talk how you like
Drink what you like
Grab who you like
Feel what you like
Eat what you like
Scratch where you like
Itch if you like
[Child:] Daddy, can I go outside?
[S.G.] Ha, go where you like, kid!

[End automated voice]

Ah, ah, ah, I feel like a nice big bowl of cereal, icy cold milk
[Child:] Daddy, can I eat some ice cream?
[S.G.] Look, I told you kid, eat what you like, OK?
[H.H.] Now the beat goes on 'til the break of dawn
And just peep this, y'all, cause we're singing a song
And do what you like, yeah do what you like
And since you came here you gotta show and prove
And do that dance, until it don't move
And do what you like
Like I said, sometimes we bite
[S.G. and H.H.] Now we're all getting stupid and acting a fool
Anything that you really wanna do is cool
So Goldfingers, cut what you like
[Now let me tell you who I am...Ah shit...]
[M.B.] Now if you're hungry, get yourself something to eat
And if you're dirty, then go take a bath
[S.G. and M.B.] And do what you like
[S.G.] Stetsasonic's not just for the hip-hop fans
And since we're not your average everyday rap band
Yo, Piano Man, play how you like

[S.G.] Just act a fool -- it's okay if you drool
Cause everybody's gonna strip and jump in the pool
...Wait a minute, wait a minute, don't take your clothes off yet, not yet --
Wait 'til we get home
[H.H.] Now if you wear corrective shoes and you got big bunions
Toenails smell and look like onions
Don't doowutchyalike--
Go see a foot doctor tonight!
Yeah, yeah, yeah, everybody doowutchyalike

[Hook]

[H.H.] Straight hair, curled, casual or glamor
[S.G.] A shy girl, or loud like a bama
[H.H.] From Connecticut, or from Louisiana
[S.G.] Bad table etiquette, too much chatter
[H.H.] Very well spoken or real bad grammar
[S.G.] A minority token, a brother in the slammer
[H.H.] A free civilian with a house in Santa Ana
[S.G.] If you got a million and living in Atlanta
[H.H.] If you got a weak bladder or can't climb a ladder
[H.H. and S.G.] What we're saying is, it really doesn't matter
[H.H.] I need a word that sounds like "Ana"
[H.H. and S.G.] Slipped on a peel of banana
Doowutchyalike

[H.H.] Yeah, cold getting stupid
[S.G.] Once again, you got the sound of the Underground
Baby Dope is in the house
[Baby Dope] Boyyy!!
[S.G.] Are we puttin' things in check, Baby D?
[B.D.] Too stupid check
[S.G.] I'm wit' it. Yo Dave, let's show 'em some old school
It makes no sense just standing around
Come on everybody, let's all...[Get down]
Yeah, and do what we like
[H.H.] From a lime to a lemon, a lemon to a lime
Come on, young ladies, let's have [good times]
[H.H. and S.G.] And do what we like
[S.G.] Now I can sing, I can dance, I'm the king of romance
Are you sweet young ladies gonna give me a chance
To do what you like
[S.G. and H.H.] And get that thing packed tonight?
[S.G.] Vanessa Williams, ooh, you're so divine
Just wanted to put your name in my rhyme
And doowutchyalike
Yeah, everybody doowutchyalike

[Hook]

End the record how we like!
