[Intro]
Boat let's do it
Ran up a check, just do it
Ran up a check, just do it
Just do it

[Hook: Ca$h Out]
Ran up a check
I just bought a new chick
I just bought some new bricks
I just bought a new chopper for them pussy ass niggas
When you speak to the trap all the hood niggas feel you
I just do it for the drugs
I just do it for the thugs
I just do it for my niggas
I just do it for these bitches
All these pussy niggas snitchin'
Know a nigga in the kitchen
I just ran up a check, ran up a check, ran up a check

[Verse 1: Ca$h Out]
Servin' all these traps, everybody gettin' money
Boy you know I'm in the kitchen
Start playing, end up missing
Chef Curry with the .30
Boy empty out the .30
Got me ridin' with the .30
Got me ridin' with the .30
And I know you niggas heard me
I'm swimmin' like Gwen Murphy
Stay 10 toes down, never ever got nervous
Can you picture me in that Maybach closin' all my curtains
Got your main bitch, she flirtin'
Told her hit me back, I'm workin'

[Bridge: Ca$h Out]
Ran up a check, stop playin', you can do it
Bitch stop playin' you can do it
Fuck your man you can do it
All that hatin' shit ain't workin'
I'm ballin' hard on purpose
I know he finna get nervous
He know I'm bout to really murk him

[Hook: Ca$h Out]
Ran up a check
I just bought a new chick
I just bought some new bricks
I just bought a new chopper for them pussy ass niggas
When you speak to the trap all the hood niggas feel you
I just do it for the drugs
I just do it for the thugs
I just do it for my niggas
I just do it for these bitches
All these pussy niggas snitchin'
Know a nigga in the kitchen
I just ran up a check, ran up a check, ran up a check

[Verse 2: Ca$h Out]
Creepin' low with that stick, ain't got the windows
Ain't got no time for these lames, extendo-extendo
You know I'm rollin' up pressure
These niggas got pressure
Cause I'm gettin' this money
But they know they can't touch me
Countin' up this cash
Livin' fast, trap rollin' fast
Never rollin' slow
Always on go, bitch don't play with my dough
Ridin' round with that mini chopper nigga
That's a Drake with an old go
Used to drako, drako, drako about my pesos
I know Migo, Migo, Migo
And he know that I won't move, won't move, won't move
Gotta get movin'
Say you want that money, you can do it, just do it
You can get it, just get it, let's get it, let's get it

[Hook: Ca$h Out]
Ran up a check

I just do it for my niggas
I just do it for these bitches
All these pussy niggas snitchin'
Know a nigga in the kitchen
I just ran up a check, ran up a check, ran up a check

[Verse 3: Lil Yachty]
Crystals on diamonds, see 'em shinin' when I'm walkin'
30,000 on that nigga, you can tell that he flossin'
Got it off the boat, I'm so important I need scobes
At the top row, when I walk around, ain't no joke
I know you hated, I'm ten ages younger
I be from the bay that shit sounds just like thunder
Pull off in a Hummer, who know where we goin'
I'll run up a check for my set
I make sure all my dogs straight like a vet
Put a chain to his neck like a motherfuckin' pet
Why'd you charge me?
Count 100,000 after Omni, I'm rich

[Bridge: Ca$h Out]
Ran up a check, stop playin', you can do it
Bitch stop playin' you can do it
Fuck that man you can do it
All that hatin' shit ain't workin'
I'm ballin' hard on purpose
I know he finna get nervous
He know I'm bout to really murk him
