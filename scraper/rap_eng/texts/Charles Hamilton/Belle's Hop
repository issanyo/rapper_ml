I heard ladies can’t get down to my new shit, the way I be producing it. I guess if you’re a Six then you dig. But chicks have Six in their vagina. Because they’ve been dipping with a minor. So please just listen to my mind when I explain my migraine. I’m the game. Hi, dames! Bitches took over the hive. Then bitches took over the high. Jimmy Iovine is my nigga, but if he switches then I’m taking over his eyes, just sobering him with rhymes. Dilla, hi. Really I’m killing vibes. And Mr. Massa, if you back up, you’re really mine

Baby can I have this dance with you?
I’ll be happy just to dance with you
I’m not looking for romance with you
I just hope I’m the man for you one night, tonight

I’m excited to get high, like I’m antisocial. And I’m hopeful that no fucking man can stand my vocals. So my hands can get untied and I’ll choke you. I’m sounding like that Black chick in Carmen Sandiego. Ayo! Harmon motherfuckers saying they know. Bring ‘caine and I’m Able. Ving Rhames on the table. Undisputed when I snipe y’all Wesleys. Let’s see… How many men exist and didn’t exist when I didn’t give a shit? I doubt women. That’s why I’m in the mouth of women. If I doubt my dick is big, then my sentences might have a little more doubt in them

Stop asking why! Just ask who. @ you like I just sneezed. Fuck me. There’s gotta be somebody that’s iller. And that guy is Dilla. Did he die? Another mystery of Four. Why are you whispering to me for? I can hear you, Lord. That’s why I’m saying a prayer between Satan’s legs, making her shake. Oh! Great break. Like Brooklyn Girls, that’s a great 8. And I ain’t even want the shit drop! Unfortunately, there’s Hip-Hop. I’m the Bull O’Connor of Rap. Fuck niggas! Publishers, come fuck with this. Uppercut niggas, fuck bitches, every day. I hope you fucking with it
