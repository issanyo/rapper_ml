Hockey Kitty

[Hook]
Cool cat, cool cat
Walkin' downtown
Walkin'-walkin' downtown
Walkin' downtown with the
Cool cat, cool cat

[Verse 1]
It's Charles now
Who's that too bad chick on his crown?
I meant mine, but I hit jaws when I'm around
So, in this talk, (get off the ground)
Anyway, 5-foot and an even digit
She told me her identity, I didn't even get it
She reminded me like (fool)
Kindly, she amused me
Like, fine, she's not a groupie
I'm not wack, though
She know the game's rules
But I don't claim jewels
I just be (lookin' like) cool
Niggas (lookin' like) fools
Meanwhile, I be lookin' bright
All the haters stay (lookin') tight
And she be lookin' like a Smurf, cool
Sonic and Smurfette, way too much blue
Stay cuttin' school
Took her on a date, yeah, we cruise
Barnes and Noble, wait for the news
She said she was datin' some dude
It must be because I gave her a break from the tool
I said, "How you doin'?"
She said, "Great, how are you?"
Didn't go that way, but it's cool
She knew she was with the

She had a coffee, I had a frappuccino
I was stuntin', told the cashier to crack a C-note
She was readin' some deep shit, I read manga
Eyes open for her, I can read danger
Like VH1 gave the bitch a book deal
Amazing shit, when you playin' with the good feelin'
She looks so good, not revealin'
Wish I had a whip, so I could pop the ceilin'
But I got nine cars, get it?
I been the underground Andretti for a minute
Did I have my Nikes on, or my Vans?
This song should make her dance
From her pants to her thong
Hopin' wifey don't cancel my bong
Fans get along when I jam to the horns
Holdin' hands like holdin' hands isn't wrong
Ladies wanna glance, I'm like, "Damn, what's wrong?"
I'm just the

[Hook]

Blu knows
Next stop was Uno
Couldn't keep my hands off her, too close!
Like dialon, she put a smile on
My face, with just sweats and no nylons
Wish she could call her friend, we get our tie on
But that's two left, and she's on my right arm
Goodnight, mom, it's time to bomb
Ha

Got the nine
And I'm 'bout to straight cock back and fire my arm
I don't know what I'm talkin' about, but I'm timin', so
