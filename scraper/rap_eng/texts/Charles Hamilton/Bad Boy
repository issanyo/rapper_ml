I walked on the bus. I ain't have change because my pocket fill of bucks. Bus driver looking at me strange - I said bus twice. What the fuck am I looking at my mirror? It's just ice for me to be ugly on the inside and yet still look you in the face and be the most intriguing person. Now back to my story of me facing me. Got on the bus like "I ain't have no change but I got bucks like could be the dude in the game." The bus driver was a female she said "Hey, you could be getting laid.walk this way." Pointed to the back of the bus. I got a free ride, gave her a smile and a peace sign. She's like she wants to reside with me, but my female presides with me

The problem that I have is that I'm super bad
I'm all you want to have because I'm super bad
And now I'm fucking evil so I super bad
If you want to get me off, you've got to love my evil

On my way to the back of the bus, a couple of ladies were yakking it up. As soon as I walked by the chatting stopped. They said "That guy has what I want." And I was like, I don't know where! But if you stare I just might care. That's just a little handsome glare. I want to to know if they want to see me bare. But I dare ask if anyone else on this bus want to give me some ass. Even niggas are looking at me like "Dag, that nigga should be my dad!" I ain't trying to father MCs like Father MC I just don't want nobody really bothering me. I'm gothic indeed and hot as can be. And they all wish to be riding my cock as far as I can see

Of course, there's a few haters. One nigga with a dirty ass Lakers jersey. His best friend was like "Yo, I know they heard me when I hated on them from a distance." Well fuck them niggas, then. All I gotta say is I got them bucks and I get it in
I don't care if I'm handsome or not. If I got to put my hands up and rock. My hand ain't on my cock. So all you niggas stop with your glearing from the past.. Glearing/glaring... But apparently you're hearing what I'm saying. Because you're all glaring at my ass. Fuck is you mad for? Nigga, I'm mad raw. The most awesome dude. By the way, your chick don't want to talk to you. She looking my way "Hi, Haze." I was high on the shit. By the way, today is Friday
