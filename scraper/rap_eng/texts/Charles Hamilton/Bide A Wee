[Verse I]
My shit is hard
By spitting bars I beat your ass with a fucking Taylor Swift guitar
It's bizarre, is this Charles?
Bitch I boss, the district Ross is getting picked off
Illuminati I was getting pissed off
They letting every mother fucker get involved
From Chris Cross, to Chris Paul to Chris Bosh
I feel like feel like Christopher Cross, just sailing
I'm galactical fuck where you're hailing
Omen 4 no one is more impaling
I got a lot to say, in a lot of ways
The best head I ever got came from Dr. Dre
No pause, dude is like a lady
Don't diss me in the music like a baby
It's true, I'm suicidal Shady
My pills got me moving like I'm 80

[Hook]
(Here puppy wuppy wuppy, Here puppy wuppy wuppy
Let me give you some puppy kisses, puppy kisses, puppy kisses
Puppy kisses, puppy kisses, puppy kisses)

Y'all love niggas, every last one of y'all love niggas, Give me some
(Puppy kisses, puppy kisses, puppy kisses
Puppy kisses, puppy kisses, puppy kisses)

[Verse II]
Deadmau5 is the new Daft
I'm Sonic, too fast but there's glue in my path
My shoes are rad I'm not a new fad
And due to my dad Matt's my new dad
I won't diss certain niggas out of fear;
Can we still be cool? Fuck outta here
I'm raising Chris Rivera without raising a fist
An amazing era this is, post jail I hope it goes well
Sober? Nope, these pills are so swell
Lithium breakfast, Depakote memories, Zyprexa is my coke and hennessy
Dope is sick of me, hopeless with disease
Smoking in the breeze, focused on the sea
Floating up on the seas
I got sevens choices
Hells flames on a blunt
Hearing heaven's voices

[Hook]
(Here puppy wuppy wuppy, Here puppy wuppy wuppy
Let me give you some puppy kisses, puppy kisses, puppy kisses
Puppy kisses, puppy kisses, puppy kisses)

Y'all love niggas, every last one of y'all love niggas, Give me some
(Puppy kisses, puppy kisses, puppy kisses
Puppy kisses, puppy kisses, puppy kisses)

All a nigga need is a whistle, let me hear 'hey Charles we miss you'
Like

I am the one with the base, like when tongues hit your face

Want me to stay?
All a nigga need is a whistle, let me hear 'Charles we miss you'

I am the one with the base, like when the tongue hits your face
Play me

Want me to stay?

[Hook]
(Here puppy wuppy wuppy, Here puppy wuppy wuppy
Let me give you some puppy kisses, puppy kisses, puppy kisses
Puppy kisses, puppy kisses, puppy kisses)

Y'all love niggas, every last one of y'all love niggas, Give me some
(Puppy kisses, puppy kisses, puppy kisses
Puppy kisses, puppy kisses, puppy kisses)
