[Intro]
Ayo, Why every mixtape gotta have an into?

[Verse 1]
I don't need religion
I live in Heathenism
Get to reading if it is some shit that needs your vision
See if this is deeper then your breathing system Jesus listens
Fuck you mean when bitch and why is he so distant?
Probably cause niggas wanna hang em and nail em
I stay in the state of thinking i won't allow vacant impalement
Derail them, Your mind is a train, Derailed 3rd
Bring electricity respect
Thinking hes next lyrically the best physically he vex every sick MC
I give em props then i put em in they place
Some of em make me sick, Can't look em in the face
They not worth the herpes sitting on the condom after straight blacking out fucking bitches out in Harlem
And i ain't saying Harlem bitches is burning
But i'm hot where i'm at hope you niggas is learning
Drive you threw a wall without giving a permit
Its a Raid, And i'm sick of you vermin's

[Hook]
This is what the scares is about
Why the planets exist
What the stars is about
Stay on your level
Stay on your level
Don't come to my level
Or you might crash down
Is this what success is all about?
A bunch of humans acting like aliens with big mouths?
Stay on your level
Stay on you level
Don't come to my level
Or you might crash down

[Verse 2]
Yo
Politics got me wishing you niggas that watch and listen got to stop and live in my position stop a minute
I gotta watch what i say about this nigga?
Cause you afraid of this bitch nigga?
You wish nigga
Dig a ditch nigga
Run and hide
Take your earthly possessions with you get mummified
I understand how a bunch of guys would wanna try to punch me in the eye
Can't stomach that i can't crumble and die wonder why?
Nigga i'm Charles Hamilton, Nuff said
Nigga i'm Charles Hamilton
Humble when i want to, Rumble when i want to
Homeless in the concrete jungle cause i want to
Got signed and still slept on a bench
Every since i was convinced nobody messing with this
R. Kelly god off, I'm especially pissed
Cause i can't even flirt without feeling like i'm molesting a bitch
My conversation comes across as game
Toss my name once and yeah of course its rape
Mentally sick of me
But that's all they say, To my face but drool when i walk away
Charles will stay as long as they, They being the fans
Admit that i'm the modern day Marvin Gaye
Props to Jay but this is Charles day every time this song should play
Always, Nigga

[Hook]
This is what the scares is about
Why the planets exists
What the stars is about
Stay on your level
Stay on your level
Don't come to my level
Or you might crash down
Is this what success is all about?
A bunch of humans acting like aliens with big mouths?
Stay on your level
Stay on you level
Don't come to my level
Or you might crash down
Stay on your level
Stay on your level
Don't come on my level
Or you might crash down
Stay on you level
Stay on you level
Don't Come to my level
Or you might crash down
Might Crash down
Might crash down
