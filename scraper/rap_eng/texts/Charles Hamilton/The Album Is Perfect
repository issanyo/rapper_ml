[Intro]
Yeah man!

[Verse 1]
I had a talk with the short white guy
And no, that doesn't mean that I snort white lines
Of course I tried to ask him how he been doing
But he was tight about the units that I've been moving
My album didn't drop yet, STUPID
The label still debating and saying they hate the music
Wait, excuse it, I mean they say it's great music
But it may be too quick to make a move with the new shit
I'm well suited, but Mr. Mathers is infatuated with Kardashian
And 50's talking about well...shooting
And DeAndre, well who gives?
Unless your phone rings, do you give 2 cents?
Cool it, I understand this predicament
Man when I get rich, I plan to initaite
How to stand in the in the city with Jack shit
The spitting pretty but grittiest...madness

[Hook]
You won't believe what Jimmy told me
You won't believe what Jimmy told me
You won't believe what Jimmy told me
You won't believe what Jimmy told me

[Verse 2]
I said "Jimmy, how does June 23rd sound?"
He said, "Word, I'm down, spread the word round"
But the label keep dragging they feet
But the whole galaxy keeps asking for me
Mad as could be, Jimmy responded, "Spread the word round"
I'll be knocking niggas out in the third round
Or the second quarter, whatever shorter
Better sport a sweater or get a beretta ordered
Me, Dre, and Dilla in a jet across the border
I'm in the backseat getting....
Hey, it's not like I said it, I got smarter
Dead up from Harlem, keep my head up
And out the clouds when I'm marching
But so awesome is how I straight deck this beat with no problems
Like...
Kaiser uppercut!
Kaiser uppercut!
Kaiser uppercut!
Kaiser uppercut!

[Hook/Outro]
You won't believe what Jimmy told me
You won't believe what Jimmy told me
You won't believe what Jimmy told me
You won't believe what Jimmy told me

I mean I read the contracts
What? Nigga I can read

Riding through the hood with my lady in a V-Dub beetle
The door fucked up but we ride with peace of mind
Pork fried rice and a SoBe feeling this should be illegal
But we don't give a fuck, we ride till the die I'll die
So mama come and light the fire around me
I'll be trying to chill but they won't stop clowning
I feel surrounded, but I feel grounded
So mama come and light the fire around me
I'll be trying to chill but they won't stop clowning
I feel surrounded, but I feel grounded

You won't believe what Jimmy told me
You won't believe what Jimmy told me
You won't believe what Jimmy told me
You won't believe what Jimmy told me
