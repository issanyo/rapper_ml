[Verse 1]
How could you say I don't deserve this??
Why can't I have a life that's perfect?!?
You know I still be on my nerd shit
But how does that NOT make me a wordsmith?
I hit the hood and I heard shit
Showing love to some undeserving bird bitch!
Word is that my whole crew fucked her
But in all honesty, I don't know who fucked her..
BUT HER!
Holding me to scream sucker
Poison Ivy lips and I would pucker
Just to suffer
But I love her!
Cause she's human, grew up without brothers
Just lovers, and I came at the right time
With the right drive, and blind eyes!
Maybe she really did fall in love with me..
But the evil in her heart used to punish me!!

[Hook]
So I take this time to dream and drift away
I can't make my mind, I scream and drift away
This is just a movie scene, I live today!
How can I wake up from dreams if it makes me die?!?

[Verse 2]
I don't wanna be your hero
I got too many bruises on my ego!
We know, we being me and I
Reason why I separate is cause he's alive!
He being my self, all three of us
Need a rush like when bullies used to beat us up!
I needed love, all I got was a fist
I needed my father's help, all I got was his dick!!
Just imagine, raped by the man I was patterned.. after
Go to school and get called a faggot!
That is, why I can't understand pedophiles
Through soul searching though, I can live better now
Never down, never out, I live in Heaven now!
I live forever now
I'm a feather now!
The Pink bantam,
The Pink Panther!
I'm thee answer to all your weak candor!!

[Hook]
So I take this time to dream and drift away
I can't make my mind, I scream and drift away
This is just a movie scene, I live today!
How can I wake up from dreams if it makes me die?!?

[Verse 3]
HchO saved my life, accept it world
Got no love for any bitch, except my girl
I love women, hate bitches and respect hoes
Cause they honest, got it??
Now let's go!!
Move forward, is this too forward???
My lawyer says "Chill when speaking so damn morbid"
I'm sorry Theo, I'm a artist for real!
And holding back my heart wasn't part of the deal!
If so??
FUCK JIMMY, FUCK YOU AND FUCK THE INDUSTRY!!!
But since you love it, Ima do it 'til you're sick of me!
This is history, the psychic rapping
I see the future, the rap Michael Jackson!
My childhood was stolen
My manhood was broken
But I'm still here, still hoping
Praying...
That at days end I can still have peace
Take away all of my fortune, you still have me....

[Outro]
You still have me..
At the end of the day, don't nobody ever say..
They love themselves
They always say "I love me"
Who the fuck is ME then, huh?
If it's all about me then I guess..
I guess that you are your own god, right???
OH, DID I JUST COMMIT BLASPHEMY, HUH?!?
Am I going to Hell because I believe I was made in God's image
HUH?!
FUCK OUTTA HERE!!
You people can be so fucking stupid sometimes, I swear
I swear to God people can just be fucking stupid!
Wake the fuck up people!!
*Laughs*
Yeah..

[Hook]
So I take this time to dream and drift away
So I take this time to dream and drift away..
I can't make my mind, I scream and drift away
This is just a movie scene, I live today!
How can I wake up from dreams if it makes me die!
Die!!
