Your inner thoughts are no longer a secret. Every song belongs in the deep end. Dive off a cliff, fall in love with your high. Talk all fly, often talk shit. Wonder why no one walked by when you spit. As if you're trying to worship the ground and it deserves a round. It only goes down. Try to spit at the Sun and it ends up in your face, whistling under. Undertaker wondering if this is just a wonder or take. One of these days I'ma take it away. The wonder of the take, with grace

If I could write a song to be silly, I would

I'm the Book of Jude. I'm who goth kids are looking to. I could bring them to God or bring them to Satan. Either way, I making seasons for them, I'm bringing them hot. As if I was trying to make hot music for the block. While the block do what it gotta do to not consider a nigga pop. I'm more like Pops (Wayans brother), old soul. Say it together. Fall in love with what's under the covers, getting old. Sitting still, getting bold with the skill of a written of God. Chill

Magick is all I need. Maybe a ball with me. SEGA, don't brawl with me. I brawl with thee. I'm on your side. Talk to your defense and your offense if you need to reside. Preside like a judge. Be my judge, be my lover. La Bouche in the booth. Keeping it moving. Stupid, but true. My IQ is doing what it do. Feel like I'm losing my snooze. Trying to come up with something wise for you. Trying to provide for you. But Christ already died for you. I'm sacrificing my view to be nice to you
