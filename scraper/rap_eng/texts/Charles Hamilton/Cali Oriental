[Verse 1]
I wish I had the chance to chill
I'm even movin' when I'm standing still
And I know you got a man but still
In this situation keep your man concealed
Cause I don't plan to reveal, how ill
I will go in for the steal, for real
Not hard to seal the deal, truth kills
You will live forever when we say we feel this real shit together
I see you and I don't, you're a mirage that i'm married to
House, picket fence, 2 car garage
Too hard to stop, too easy to let go
But you gettin' me tight like you need to let go
I'm not trying to make you somethin' you not
Even though I been wantin' to pop. You been wantin' it, stop
You been frontin', it's not for incoming calls
I hope I come across like I know something
Meet me at the

That means give it some time
The world doesn't end if you're livin' a lie

Every girl that visits my mind, gets just a little blind
Anytime they enter my mind, as a thought of whatever
You might think I talk to them all just for pleasure
But nah, it's even better, I wanna love every woman
Skinny with no depth, or a meaningful heavy woman
A smart woman most likely is a deadly woman
I need a house wife, Wilma, Betty woman
End of the day, sounds like I need a steady woman
So break out the confetti, woman
I took you to the

[Bridge x2]
The weather's just as hot as it wanna be
So mami, pass the wasabi
What's hotter than the girl that's in front of me
The Sake really really got me
No stress, no stress at all. No stress at all
No stress, no stress at all. No stress at all
