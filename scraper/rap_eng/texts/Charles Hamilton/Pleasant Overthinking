Yeah, I'm back wit the chair up against the wall
Unfair but I don't care, What's the sense of all
The unshared if it was shared with you
Why share ain't somethin considered unfair to you?
Hold it together, I think as I pass the joint
Notice the gesture? I quote it then yes sir
You get it the it factor, if I have it I give it
Only to regenerate it in a minute
Aware or not whether I care or not
Whether you indeed are scared or not
Isn't my care so prepare to stop
I'm nowhere near a Glock but I'm deadly when I share a tock
Tick, of my scary watch
Every second that flashes
Another second to the message left in the ashes
As it turns out I can never burn out
And you wishin you could learn how

(Chorus)
The stress, the pressure, the pain
I'm dealin' with it all
The press, the letters, the names
I'm dealin' with it all
When this life becomes more than a lifeguard
Just stand in the room with the lights off, and whisper to yourself
I'm dealin' with it all

I share my wisdom as ripe as it is
But it comes from the life that I live
Hated life as a kid
Not like where I live
Couldn't ride a bike til I was like twelve
Felt like my life was like hell
Might as well try to prevail
Or die and tell all the guys in hell
Why the sky might have fell
So when people say I'm nice as hell
And how I inspire
My eyes swell
Might have caught a couple of rights
When I fight myself
At night but the mic is how I like to trail
A fire to the entire cite where the spiders dwell
I guess that'd be the internet
The charlantula's been a threat
If you didn't get it yet hit the web
My visions spread
The kid invests his interest
Into the best
Livin' stress-free but knowin' there are people who aren't as of stress, me

Chorus

It might be cuz I think too much
I’m out my mind
Or maybe cuz I need too much
Think about that line
I don’t wanna lose control
Just take your time
You can’t hear it then lose your soul
To help you define
(x2)

Chorus
