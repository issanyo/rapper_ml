Got a bad chick on my body. Touching me. In love with me. Probably not, because she's so in love with these... you know, tracks. I don't hold back. The fact I go in with my nutsack being held seems well, but it's not enough. Handheld like Game Gear. Am I hot enough? I'm a problem, but problems get solved. I get pissed off. When I get off, I don't like to leave. And when *she* leaves, I don't like it AT ALL. Why am I making love songs so much? Probably because the song is... what's up! The Song of Love. Song of Solomon. It's biblical! I'm in love!

I can't stand to be me. I can't stand to be me
(I always let you down)
Can you stand with me please?
But, I'm so afraid...
(I always let you down)
Can't stand to be me
Can't stand to be me
(I always let you down)
Can't stand to be me
But... you make it easy...
(I don't want to let you down)

Hamilton is always panicking. Like my nigga Rome. "Damn again." Wondering if I should stand with them, because they do shit that I stand against. You know, 6z. Minding my business. Gettin' it in, with them. My dick licked. THANK YOU! My dick is... NOT doom, but I ain't you. So, to get you, I gotta be hotter than your perfume. Hi, Zamata! I gotta get with you! And your best friend (BODY!). All of them, too! Mace Windu. Smooth off the top. "Move off the block!" like I said in "Jeezy Hamilton". But that's me standing in another booth, holding a phone. I'm holding a can. Hold the phone! I'm the man!
