(CHatter)
I read somewhere that me going into deep thought is bad for me..
Alright, whatever
.......Is it bad for you?

(Verse 1)
White House leaders
Blast this in your White House speakers
Right now I'm about to ether!
I now find the kind of government we live in
Smothering the love of citizens and they had enough of it!
What???
This nigga's only a kid
He must've wrote this stoned, with mad homies in the crib
The only accident is that I been trapped and asking shit
Throwing a rapper fit
A real nigga activist!
Went to Atlanta on the Clark-Atlanta campus
Hard to watch the poverty, my heart could hardly stand it!
The resident's complacent
Make low-class a pleasant situation
Blessed because they patient
Now at the same time.. (We bo, we bo, we both know that!)
We want a bright future, we won't go back
Covering ground
Never fucking around
This is a new day and you loving the sound!

(Hook)
Everybody knows it's time (to) move on!
Everybody knows we all just gotta move on!
A-Move On-On
Move On-On!
Get over it...
Whatever it is, whatever it is!

(Verse 2)
Ayo Barack
My paranoia lies in the eyes of the paranoid crying 'cause the lies the guys that..
Avoided confronting
Enjoy it or something
(but) this ain't a little toy that you running
Niggas live here!
I ain't a little boy, I'm annoying, a hunnid
Pardon me for having a little joy in my stomach
My woman said she had a little boy in her stomach..
Her man flipped, no unemployment was coming!
Resources meet morbid reassortments of whats important
We sport the street course..
That you gotta walk, if you gonna talk alot as you walk around the block of New York
I'm cocky of course
Bad choice of words, I just gotta watch where I walk
Possible flaw, society lost!
Type in the clause and all types of rewards!
That ain't right 'cause the rightful end up stifled with a riffle in they jaw!
Call it injustice!
So ingest this
Let's begin justice!

(Hook)
Everybody knows it's time (to) move on!
Everybody knows we all just gotta move on!
A-Move On-On
Move On-On!
Get over it...
Whatever it is, whatever it is!

(Verse 3)
Niggas snitch on themselves when they be rapping!
Helpless to imagine the shells that they be packing
Tell you they will blast ya melon back into the 70's!
Blast you back to the matter
Send you to Hell in a casket!
With such lies and irrelevant facts
Does it matter if the President is Black???
That....
Is why I'm more concerned to see if the President is wack
If the Cabinet is passing the rhetoric, ask him
I'll never be passive but I'm better with rapping
Never take a glance at the Legislative branch
But yes we did put another meaning on Executive!
My bars are so Judicial soldiers throw a fit!
Hold ya fist!
Know this shit'll be over quick
I'm so the shit!

(Hook)
Everybody knows it's time (to) move on!
Everybody knows we all just gotta move on!

Move On-On!
Get over it...
Whatever it is, whatever it is!
