(Verse 1)

As the incense burns to A Tribe Called Quest, I search my phone book for the bitch that I'll call next. My mind's all vexed and I'm all stressed. The woman that I called wife forgets that I love her and she left, and I'm all a mess. My ipod gets the best of me. She has her own playlist called "destiny". Yeah, I'm hurt ,but pain is in the recipe of this meal called life. My wheels are alive ,but I can't drive without the passenger navigating. I had to procrastinate it and now she's gone. Now I'm sitting here drunk playing Al Green songs ,but I ain't know how to make her stay, take away the pain evident to this angel that I thought was heaven sent. She ain't believe me when I said the bull was through. I guess this next bong pull's for you. So

(Hook)

If you should leave then leave. Don't stand there. Leave. Don't make me leave. But, you would never leave with my heart on my sleeve. I can't believe that you wanna leave. But, if you leave. I would grieve ,because I need..

"you and me" x6


(Verse 2)

I said sorry for the cheating, cut back on the lies, spend my life in the studio, but cut back on the time. Stop letting bitches spy on me, cut back on the rhymes, and I did it all cause of the fact that you're mine. Almost killed your step-pops cause I thought he would harm you. Stopped doing so much drugs, lord knows it's hard to. I ain't give a shit about myself, you made a nigga care. Wake up suicidal to a smile, cause you're sitting there. This shit isn't fair. I know I'm selfish ,but it was you that spoiled me, treated me like royalty, stayed by me loyally. How the fuck was I  to know that you was straight annoyed with me? You never avoided me. But, how can I tell you when it's you that's annoying me? Not cause you love me ,but cause I can't show it back ,cause I'm busy getting love. But, damn son can rap. Damn this is crap. I need my woman. But


(Hook)

If you should leave then leave. Don't stand there. Leave. Don't make me leave. But, you would never leave with my heart on my sleeve. I can't believe that you wanna leave. But, if you leave. I would grieve ,because I need..

"you and me" x6


(Bridge)x2

I just wanna cry by myself. Just leave me alone. I guess I'll try by myself. Just leave me alone. I'll find out why by myself. Just leave me alone. But, I think I'll die by myself. Don't leave me alone


(Hook)x3

If you should leave then leave. Don't stand there. Leave. Don't make me leave. But, you would never leave with my heart on my sleeve. I can't believe that you wanna leave. But, if you leave. I would grieve ,because I need..

"you and me" x6
