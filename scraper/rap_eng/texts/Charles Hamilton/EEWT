We made contact!

[Verse 1]
To my many listeners, I miss you much
This is Just me not leavin’ off, but pickin’ up
Where I left you last, suspense
I been busting my ass, now I have to vent
Cash was spent, bad percent of what I established
Gets thrown in the stash
For me being such a Napoleon ass
My way or the information super high way
I do music on a nice day
No music, then there is light rain
An all out storm is me on a tirade
Like me become a sky chase
But let me get this right
My supporters are numbers and dummies?
I love so much, I go in debt provin’ it
But is honesty lucrative? You should pick
Foolishness gets thrown in the garbage can
Retarded in the hands, but

[Hook]
Can I ever find a love like this?
Can I ever find a love like that?
Can I ever find a love like you?
Will you ever let me get my love back?
Wait, he don’t love you like I love you
Wait, she don’t love you like I love you
Wait, they don’t love you like you love me
Wait, nobody love you like I love you

[Verse 2]
She was the only one I called
My girl was appalled
Lonely but I stalled
I was off the wall
Collecting my thoughts
Before the collect call
Born on a jet, got a text
What would our next talk
Sound like?
It was a text, but more like a sound byte
Reading “I love you, dear” ain't sound left
Hearin’ I love you made me look at the ground, like
Damn
I do what I can, assuming I can
Blue in the glands, choosin' to stand
Too many fans zoomin’ in
Who began to dive in
Find us vibin’
My new love chimed in sayin’ “I’m in”
So I grin
Shortened time like 5 min. period
You tease, but I been serious
5 minutes turned to two hours
Causin’ two lovers to scowl, to sour

[Hook]
Can I ever find a love like this?
Can I ever find a love like that?
Can I ever find a love like you?
Will you ever let me get my love back?
Wait, he don’t love you like I love you
Wait, she don’t love you like I love you
Wait, they don’t love you like you love me
Wait, nobody love you like I love you

[Verse 3]
Finding love, finding me
I am just finding indeed
Cryin’ sucks I just bleed
That’s the problem
I hold it in and never let a person notice it
To go within is so many cold shoulders and broken fins
But don’t go in, returning isn’t certain, I’m working
And smirkin’, never lookin’ back because
The past is packed with hurtin’
That is perfect, past the surface
Is where I dwell
Trapped in a cell
Askin for help
Lookin’ at scars
In my book there is nothing but Charles’s bars
Am I arrested or infested with suggestions
That I never even beckoned?
Or do I step with
What I been blessed with
Have I said it before
Or does it need repeating?
Even then, do I even need to sleep in the evening?
All I ask is…

[Hook]
Can I ever find a love like this?
Can I ever find a love like that?
Can I ever find a love like you?
Will you ever let me get my love back?
Wait, he don’t love you like I love you
Wait, she don’t love you like I love you
Wait, they don’t love you like you love me
Wait, nobody love you like I love you
