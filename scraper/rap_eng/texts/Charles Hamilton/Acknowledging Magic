[Intro]
Yes, yes
You are listening to my soul
I would greatly appreciate it if you don't criticise this

[Verse 1]
What came first, the chicken or the egg?
The creator
But he's a chicken
In my head I'm not a chicken
Cause a matter of fact, I'm simply nervous
As I make this beat to wake up my neighbors
This beat isn't necessarily what bothers them
It's more so the lyrics that I'm gobbling
And not spitting
Do you wish to be who knows what I'm gonna spit?
As history shows, it's full of shit
But shit, I'm gonna spit
So when I come from the heart, no need to grip a pen
Yes, from deep within, I wish to be deep within you
But I need to continue
All the things I say, all the things she said
Such a tattoo, all the things in bed I can do
But to have you, I have to make a choice:
Music or something taboo?

[Hook]
No lying, this is magic
If I could tune you in me
No lying, this is magic
Musically I'm Houdini

Yes I really want you
But I can't stop the magic
Yes I really want you
But I can't stop the magic

[Verse 2]
Don't let skill be a hindrance of what you feel
Because I am the master of then again and I'm real
My watch touch, what will hold paper
And my watch basically looks like I hold paper
But I'll let you hold my watch while I take you higher than most skyscrapers
Your desire is my favor
I do favors for my ladies and my ladies are saying "later"
Why? I don't know, let's not look at the top layer
Because I'm fly, I know, but I've got a neighbor
And my neighbor knocks on the walls
I wish to knock on the walls of the hottest of broads, but he's such a hater
And this hatred is making other people who wish to be greater...follow him
So can you not follow him and swallow my little kids
Sorry for leaving... Sorry for being so naughty but

[Hook]
No lying, this is magic
If I could tune you in me
No lying, this is magic
Musically I'm Houdini

Yes I really want you
But I can't stop the magic
Yes I really want you
But I can't stop the magic

[Verse 3]
This beat, mine
You, mine
You wish to take it from behind
Deep time, I can your mind
You're trying to block me, yes I see the sign
Your glasses mean you want molasses to be
Dripping from your ass and I wish to laugh at your cheeks
As they rise and get rosy
I really know thee, and I haven't been inside you
I just asked my homie
My homie is my sigh
Hi, you must've thought I was talking about that another guy
No, bottom line, I know I got the hottest lines
And you right now and tonight can be mine, for a pretty long time
Make a night last forever
How can a night last forever
We're so late in the morning
But as the song sings itself
With help, you could be on me

And no matter what, I'm on key, holla

[Hook]
No lying, this is magic
If I could tune you in me
No lying, this is magic
Musically I'm Houdini

Yes I really want you
But I can't stop the magic
Yes I really want you
But I can't stop the magic

No lying, this is magic
If I could tune you in me
No lying, this is magic
Musically I'm Houdini

Yes I really want you
But I can't stop the magic
Yes I really want you
But I can't stop the magic
