Mean taxes. NCAA, I need three brackets like I need Magic. See me as Kravitz. CraftMatic, don’t sleep on me. Mad faggots have a frequency. I call them niggas low and high. Hello to my high, bye to the low. Niggas vanish, speaking Spanish. Speaking candid to them niggas that left. All I have left is a Clef, like Pras and Lauryn. Props to Lauryn. I’m not as boring as I say I am. Y’all just got to shake my hand. Round of applause or put you hands to the sky then let them touch the floor, my Lord

I am the Sun

Clean taxes. You ain’t got to hustle weight to get away with what I mean. That’s it. Off the top like a fitted since I had to break it down, a sound. Sonic the Hedgehog, you around me now. Bitches can’t clown me now. You found me, wow! Like Rihanna with the thoughts. I thought I taught her where to get the Wild Style from. Not from the 80’s, more like Jay Dee. General Manager of the Blacks. Keep them 'slaved, keep a page. Read away. My mind is like Anita Baker, I rap to your E, nigga. Ecstasy. You better believe it’s a wrap for the streets when I pull the trigger

I don’t want to grown up because if I did, I wouldn’t be a motherfucking kid. And if I grow up, shit. I might be a Six. I’m feeling greater than Tony, with more white, all night. Y’all flaking. All of y’all are garbation. What are y’all saying? Must I write it down? Must I incite the sound? Igniting these nouns and verbs and adjectives that these faggots spit? Y’all wouldn’t spit if it wasn’t for this Massa kid. A masochist, I have to spit. Like Jada, just not average. See ya later, it’s SEGA. I shine and I establish it all
