I just let them know one thing: they can hold one thing
But I'ma let them go when that one sings
My voice has been making me climax
Safety in the sky, I asked
And God provided me with such
I had to give up inside of her
Probably through sodomy
She committed a sin, too
I guess my essence is so sinful
Give me a S since my essence in the S's isn't a riddle. Something that'll make your intuition giggle
Especially when I'm tickling your nipples
Or the ivorys
Tell they Isley's they in the past, get behind me
I'm getting smooth when I'm getting ridiculed
Ain't nobody making fun right now
So how about wow should be the response...

I am so bad!
Yes I am!
Yes I fuckin' am!
I am so bad!
Yes I am!
Yes I fuckin' am!
This is for when I wonder about you
You should be here
There should be no wonder about you...

I started smoking cigarettes to get sexier
And then these broads got pettier
The smoke got heavier
It's almost as if I'm a new Dean Cain. Or James Cain. James Dean. James Caan. Jason Khan
So many names to make up on when in a song
Joseph Khan, when directing the footage - Ain't nobody getting what I'm looking at

Neither am I, because I can't really see me from my eyes
So when the day comes when I get to spray one and see me, guaranteed I'ma be easy
The easiest slut you ever met. Forever I can get you wet, One. Charles Hamilton
Land on my lap and make the land wanna crack

I am so bad!
Yes I am!
Yes I fuckin' am!
I am so bad!
Yes I am!
Yes I fuckin' am!
This is for when I wonder about you
You should be here
There should be no wonder about you...
