I woke up not feeling so SEGA, not even like a player. Honestly, I wanted to be the Alpha Omega. The destroyer of the planet and existence, either with weapons or my very own sentences. I mind my business but I end the business with a stupendous spliff. Let me get higher than the very concept of desire, and I'll set everything on fire. I told niggas I was thinking retirement because I don't give a shit. All they told me was "Charles, you gotta throw a fit. Knock 'em out the box like you riding out with with Rick." So I do the Dougie every time a new nigga come in the game, especially if they say they love me. Shouts to Gambino and to Lil' B, but be real with yourself when you say you're feeling me. Kill 'em, B!

Dear Dr. Doom...Impossible! Y'all gotta get it together!
Dear Dr. Doom...Impossible! I do this shit forever
Dear Dr. Doom... I read your recent letter
You left some room, I hope you're feeling better

Dr. Doom doesn't care about you, he simply has a staring bout with the truth. You give me the truth, don't worry about my inner skeleton. I will never go to Hell again. Bending up tracks and throwing them shits at fans. Like get back man, I got a 6-pack and when I get stabbed in the abdomen nothing really happens. But I be rapping from the cap and I'm the captain of this entire chatting shit. I run conversations like mouths. Niggas want to get down as I douse. Get as high as you can but I doubt you can really plot on your man, but find out. No one really bothering and when I come out of my little pocket I'm going to shout. Cause nobody can hear me when I try to keep it humble, 'til I make everything crumble

I don't brag about being the CEO of existence. I just keep my E-G-O in a sentence and put White-Out over it. Every time I say "Lights out!" and sober a bitch when she wants to spit. It's only a female inspiring a dude to rap, while I fire at the dude and fire the dude from rap. What am I gonna do when you guys ruin a track? Make a track that I can move and then I move the track. I can do the Trap thing if I want to, but I'ma be the one they go to. So on "Two," let me stay in isolation with my wack shit. By the way, I don't mind if this is classic. I just keep my mind away from that shit. I got a good track record, and that's it. I wrapped it! Try to come back and shit. I'll snap your hips, snatch your lips and kiss my dick with it
