Putting in work like my dick every time I jerk for a chick. For certain, I’m not trying to spit. I’m just trying to talk, but I’m not trying to quit. So fuck New York if them niggas on my dick. I got a pitchfork and I’m quick to dig in a bitch. And since niggas got bitches in them, I guess I can continue spitting. To all my ladies in the house, let me play with your mouth. Pick that bottom lip up, obviously it’s lust. Now let me play with what’s in your blouse. I’m not Kanye right, I ain’t even in a G.O.O.D. mood. I guess just want to be who you look to, that’s all

No time to waste
I want to see a smile on her face when I get home

24 hours in the day, four 6s. As least, that’s how I was. Force, dig this. Shit’s changing, or still the same because my shit’s is banging. I don’t remember making hits back in the day, but when. Same day, the main event, If I got to swing at a nigga with a chain and shit. Why my nigga had to be a foe? Like Biggie, unbelievable. I see it, though. So, bad bitches, let me see your throat. You can read the flow. Crack this bottle, Evenflo. Cracking models, scene hoes. Still C-H in a filthy way. I’m not guilty today

God damn. I got a gut and I like to fuck.  Let me put my weight on your butt while you back up like you just pressed left, pressed escape or pressed eject. But yesterday was when you’d pressed eject. Everything is digital, so it’s not physical. These niggas be popping shit in the booth. And I pop their shit when I’m, well, telling the truth. On some sick shit, to Hell with you dudes. But then we’re going to be lasting. We’re going to be laughing while you fellas are through. And ladies, don’t cross me, don’t play me. I talk softly, but I’m crazy. Lately, it’s all awkward. And she’s still my baby. Charles Hamilton
