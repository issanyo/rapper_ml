[Verse 1]
She said to caller before the flight takes off
Said goodnight takes off her clothes and goes to talk to ghost
I know because I slept with her
But the sex with her ain't why I mess with her
See to me she's like a messenger with the best center
It's called a heart, each beat makes her breast bigger
I guess she really is living for the next nigga
Not to get richer but instead thicker
Thick in her skin so she can live through this shit again
She cries tears of overwhelming joy
And dies with the laughter of pain in the back of her brain
My helpless toy
But she's not for recreation heavy pacing
From her deadly ways got me praying for our next vacation
Rest in patients all I need in this life of sin
She's not my girl friend she's a cyber grin

[Hook]
I could never get over you
I never got over you
I will never get over you
What kind of spell do you got me under
I have got to wonder
What kind of spell do you got me under
Or is it a spell that you got me under this could be love

[Verse 2]
Pink balloons when I think of you peek-a-boo
You cop me a blue beetlejuice lunch box
The color of sonic but what need to do
Is eat the food called fun chew all crumbs
Spit out the remains till it grew awesome
Create life when they say my name right
Day time play nice weight my options
Believe in you or get the shock of my life like Pikachu
Just because I'm mellow don't mean you should doubt me
Nothing yellow about me got to hell in a Audi
Come back in a beetle as a Beetle biggest position
All from spitting as a musician
And you my mus but you're gone
But I doubt this is a powerful song
If there was a location where cowards belong
Every day I would go to show you how strong
I got its been so long

[Hook]
I could never get over you
I never got over you
I will never get over you
What kind of spell do you got me under
I have got to wonder
What kind of spell do you got me under
Or is it a spell that you got me under this could be love

[Verse 3]
The prettiest orgre from the city
But over the city is the way I knowing
I roll in the city roll with me
You make me appear sane to this clear stranger
World I can hear again the red and white cord is plugged in
But I can't find the yellow joint for nothing but I'm bugging
This is a love letter so spitting game will end it like PS3
Please let we be set free while the trees get discrete
Feels like I didn't sleep for a week
Every night that your ass ain't on the phone with me
Sheesh
I ain't got no damn grief but I'll be damned
If happenstance has a chance at a avalanche
For we know I'm going to break through the force field
Cause the force is real I ain't got to ask of course you feel

[Hook]
I could never get over you
I never got over you
I will never get over you
What kind of spell do you got me under
I have got to wonder
What kind of spell do you got me under
Or is it a spell that you got me under this could be love
