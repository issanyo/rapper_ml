I don't write when I get a pen (pin). Therefore, I'm just nice when I spit from within. Niggas like, "Charles. When you on the mic, get it together." And I'm like, "When I'm on the mic, try to get it again." First time you hear it, it's like a windpipe punch. Second time, you're not near it. But, then I lunch on the third time, reminding you the first time (nigga) this is brunch. Kinds of beats. THESE kinds of beats. And I'm nice to beats, so be kind to me. Haven't you heard me? Don't I look like a chick who's nerdy and curvy? Well, I WIN! And WHEN I DECIDE I WANNA TRY, I'LL TRY AGAIN! No Aaliyah. You need to know the fever. Even divas know who could beat it and leave them needing MORE...

When I'm on a beat, I'm trying
When I'm on my feet, I'm trying
Grinning in defeat, because I'm trying
The winner of the streets, because I'm trying
When I'm making love to you
I'm trying to understand you, too
When I'm making love to you
I'm trying to understand you, too

I have (had) sex with my new girl while reading her Tarot. She already knows her bone marrow was unprepared to see The Heart (The Lover Card). So I gave her with a deck of Knives (Ace of Swords), like "Let us depart." She like, "Your special, but CHARLES! WHY YOU GOTTA DO IT SO HARD?!" I came out with The Joker card. And I wasn't playing Poker. I know the broad. I'm tryna make her cum without being inside her. Make her P (wrap) from her vagina (fact). Inside it, without using the thing I be abusing when I slide in her. Nevermind her. I would like her Fur to just "brush" on my face. Turn the beat on and then brush her away

When I'm on a beat, I'm trying
When I'm on my feet, I'm trying
Grinning in defeat, because I'm trying
The winner of the streets, because I'm trying
When I'm making love to you
I'm trying to understand you, too
When I'm making love to you
I'm trying to understand you, too

I'm trying to make aliens acceptable on Earth. NOTHING here is respectable in a verse. Because verses have to be hard (Beyonce). And I'm ACTUALLY hard when I look at a star (J Dilla). See "God" in my rear view; see God coming near me, so who's coming near you (Jack Splash)? MY FATE. (Mystic) God is irate (Davina). Why wait? (Tim & Bob) Why be fake? (Talking Heads) I "I... oh late!" (Daft Punk) Isolate, idolize, and then make an idolatrist state EXIST NO LONGER (SEGA). As I read my girl's ... Tarot when she removed her thong. Word. I do it stronger. Doesn't it sound like there was a book in my palm, nerds? Wrong dirt. You lookin for this? Go to church

When I'm on a beat, I'm trying
When I'm on my feet, I'm trying

The winner of the streets, because I'm trying
When I'm making love to you

When I'm making love to you
I'm trying to understand you, too
