Watch the Goth *it* kick a night, in half. Got a hot chick on Skype. Watchin' a nigga, while he kicks ass. "This is like 6 Flags! I can pick a ride! An instrument to ride on!" Niggas can't get on my songs. My shit is too complicated. I been doin' it for too long. You can't say this dude's wrong. Perfectionist. An exorcist. Lifting out your spirit and making you give neck to your within. Spit out what you've been hiding like you've been lying. Then I'ma be next to hit ... it. No secrets (from me) can be kept, ya dig? I'm too excellent. Throw it up like you like it, and we're the best of friends

I guess I wanted you
I want you, but that's not enough
I guess I wanted you
I want you, but that's not enough
Something I want to say, but words escape me
Satisfaction is my only problem
Permanently. Unconditionally

I need fans but I don't need groupies. Niggas try to use me. Usually, I'd find it cool (to me). But lately, I've been saving my dough. Making it stretch. Like Mr. Fantastic. And... that's it. Damn that shit! Hating the best as I go, doing my thing. Gary Payton on the west and I swing-pass to my Kobe... which is Chuck. Which is the biggest "What's up?". Niggas can't seem to "get up" to the sound, so they "get down." Looking around. While they look down. Who's been guiding them? I'm inside of it. Proud of them. Now I want to be as loud as them. C'mon

This hook is the hottest shit. Yeah, I had to jot the shit. See, the concept is... the topic is, when you want something, how much do you got to give? I had a lot to give. And then, I lost it all. Now it's Charles' ball. And I'm off the wall. M-I-C-H (am I CH?) A-E-L (aliens exist, life). Kinda like, "Stay away from hell." Spell it out, though. Out cold goes the beat. The poetry and the prose that I speak makes niggas OD. So deep. I'm making rain with my brainstorm. Which means anyone with a brain is on. My brain is TOO high. I might get sawed by the chainsaw in the sky...
