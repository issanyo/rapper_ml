It's an overdose to control you. I hold your soul but there's no use of me having one. So I gave you mine. And we don't take up time. As a matter of fact, we can bug it. Please, don't fuck with me - I don't fuck with thee. Unless it's followed by 'E' And then comes the bug, apology do. We can be anything we need to be, even each other's groupies. Love me, don't play me. One of these days, I'll go so crazy and end up with you. In the same position, not to diss you. No opposition, just this dude kicking his ass, because I'm physical

I can stand with you
I can even dance with you
I'll romance with you
But that's like (loving the dead)

Your fight for freedom is my fight to be free. And I fight for thee, and with thee. No amnesty from me. You can't be free, that would be anarchy! It's such a shame to see people lay and define the lame me. While I'm staying in time, I'm basically making time to stay inside of the same game as thee. It all remains the same, so dangerously. We both can complain, but the brains are open. So, Game, I'm hopping in a different bot. Popping them and getting twat. Lots of them and my bitch is hot. Stop again and I'll hit the rock

I can stand with you
I can even dance with you
I'll romance with you
But that's like (loving the dead)

We survive each time we realize that peace of mind is the only thing we can't buy. We stand by each and every line defined by fans. I am the hand in my controller, taking over the solar. When it gets to night, my chips will be right and I'll be Kryptonite. At least when my eyes look into me. Find out there is no end to me. Again, unless you're a crook. And then I'll have to end thee once again. No envy from by eyes, just 'B' from the red. B-L-U-E. Don't don't do a U-ie. This beat's from the head

I can stand with you
I can even dance with you
I'll romance with you
