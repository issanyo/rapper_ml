[Verse 1]
Miss. Can I call you, Miss?
I got your number so like, can I call you, miss?
She said, "You don't need a phone to reach me
Cause vocal thoughts lead to arguments."
I'm sure you won't believe me
If I said I was talkin' to God and shit
But it's all legit, all of it
So just listen to the way we talk and lift off with this
She said, "I was eyeing you from afar
From a star, I watched you from someone's car"
The glare of light in that person's rear view
When the wind blows, that means that I'm near you
I said, "I hear you, miss. Wait, what's your last name?"
She said, "Dess."
I said, "God, You're a mess."
Lets, talk and reflect. Walk with me
Tell me how hard I've been blessed

[Chorus]
Show me who you are and I will do the same
I will never do you wrong
I know better than to hurt you
I can't make mistakes
I swear I love you more
Than anyone can
I think you understand me, baby

[Verse 2]
I said, "Do you get mad when I talk about
The bitches I done fucked in the past?"
She said, "Nah, but there are ladies who do, so
Don't get stuck in the past"
I said, "God you taught me a lot, an awful lot
But I feel awful, a lot."
I sold my soul to myself, I'm so alone
Over domes I go, with every poem thrown
From my point of view, everything points to you
But you point to me, humanity is annoying me
She said, "You are far from a boy to me
Your noise is sweet, no way you're annoying me
Join the beat, become your own instrument
I love you, and I'm watching. Listening
Your negative thoughts are just me hugging you tighter
Pressure makes you write hard, so fuck it, it's fire."

[Chorus]
Show me who you are and I will do the same
I will never do you wrong
I know better than to hurt you
I can't make mistakes
I swear I love you more
Than anyone can
I think you understand me, baby

[Verse 3]
"Don't leave me miss," I said
As she walked from the bar
She was off to the stars
I was drunk from her potent presence
No liquor involved but I was copacetic
She beamed down and said
"Your bars are my lullabies
So hard, but calm and I love it, why?
You're Charles Hamilton, but act like you're just another guy
As if you don't reside up in the sky
And you worry bout' goin' over nigga's heads
And bitches fed, cause you said, they was givin' head
I won't lie, you are brash with delivery
But you're not one to dash from your inner beast
Besides, I ask you for chivalry
You have what you've given me
It's mad elementary
This kinda love can last for a century
But you're Charles and your passion is history
Forever."

[Chorus]
Show me who you are and I will do the same
I will never do you wrong
I know better than to hurt you
I can't make mistakes
I swear I love you more
Than anyone can
I think you understand me, baby
