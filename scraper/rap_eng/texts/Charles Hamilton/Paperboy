[Intro - B.o.B]
You don't say so? Vote for Pedro, wait
I mean, vote for Kato, he's on the bass, though
Yeah, you know we chop it up like Idaho potatoes
So on this beat we chop it, chop it, chop it...

[Hook]
Two-wheeler on the road with that paper, boy
18 speeds with the paper, boy
Going door-to-door with the paperboy
Burning trees, no seeds, just the paper, boy
Two-wheeler on the road with that paper, boy
18 speeds with the paper, boy
Going door-to-door with the paperboy
We be them paperboys, we be them paperboys

[Verse 1 - Charles Hamilton]
Top of the verse like the first bar
Drunk as a Disney child star - hurts hard
Feeling Buffy on my Huffy when it skirts off
I can mash potato, turning you jerks off
So cool, raisin in the sun till it's prune juice
Playing with guns, till I say to someone to shoot loose
Perfect circle like the group I used to groove to
Top of a capital A, because I work hard
Making the band, getting laid in a van
But I never shake in my Vans
Just taking chances
Smirk, Charles, you're going berserk, Charles
CH is perfect with the curt bars
Just in case you missed her (perfect), like Wilson
Rap is on my radar, so is Hilson
School niggas, like Regis, make what you feel bend
Ask Chris Rock; went over your head? Call an astronaut
I'm the special that you have to watch
Smackdown for Playstation, pass the Rock
Sonic the Hedgehog, fast or not
Attitude of Kathy Griffin, fat but hot
Accountant wanna see all the cash I got
Bitch, you ain't a CPA, so you can have a not
N-O-T, no-k, okay? Yo Kato
Basically, I'm bottoming out, su castros

[Hook]

[Verse 2 - B.o.B]
I got skills, nun-chuck skills
Rowing skills, bowing skills
I'm pretty much just flowing still
So I guess I got boating skills
What, are y'all sewing quilts?
All on this like toes on stilts
So I tilt like bowling wheels
Knock y'all down like bowling pills
Bowling pins, oh no
Here I go, floating again
Up to the sky like smoke in the wind
Up to the ozone again
Here's the grand opening
Here we go, show begins
What am I frozen again?
What am I, what am I frozen again
I don't even know this flow
Who knows where it is?
I don't even roll with a pen
I don't even know when it's cold
I be in the cold when it's 32 below with a grin
I don't even know when I limp
I don't even know when I'm here
I be in the zone when I float
'Cause I float like a boat full of coke
With a moat, when it gets to the coast
And it gets to the show and they chop it, chop it...

[Hook]
