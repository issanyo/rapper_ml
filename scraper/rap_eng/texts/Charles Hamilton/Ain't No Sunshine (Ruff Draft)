My estrogen deliverer got out so I gotta keep on remembering the shit I'm not about. I'm not in her mouth. Nervous as shit, pot in my mouth. Cotton mouth, bout to drop out. I might have been one of those when I decided to not doubt. Knocked out, got up, Donnie McClurkin, or that other family who be lurking
Shot out a box, got out the box, thought about the roof. Stopped out the box for being some shit these hood niggas thought about in the booth. They become the box, I wake up in the box.

Now how could I forget to drop a hook
I don't get a lot of twat I gotta look
Mad cause I don't get it, have to find a fitted

Scared of my nuts but I'm tearing shit up. Grab the right one with the left, but I'm scared as fuck. I barely get up, a direction rhymes. Erection time, next to shine, next in line
Blessed to find a second time I'm nevermind. Nevermind gets divine, half the Heaven sign. Heaven sign, extra time, never shine. "Better than I" says the guy who's next to me, but only
Psychically. Unfortunately, to those 6's with ditches, it's sexually. Except Talise. Except my mom, except the house, except the lease. Except the bomb, except the bounce, except police. Respect the bounce, respect the blessed, restrept the geif. I mean, shit, I'm an extra Zangief on Schweppes. And Jeff, you left, peace
