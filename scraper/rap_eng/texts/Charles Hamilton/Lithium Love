Beauty, in the eye of the beholder. No need to be sober. It’s you and I, until we die, and then we cross over. I’m in the lane. Niggas driving me insane. And I ain’t talking whip game, but you know I got the Nissan appeal. I’m THAT! Do the math. Move it back. I’m getting hissed at by these different chicks and cats. Shit is mad interesting, in fact. But, I wish to sit back and get tracks to rip. And this is a wish come true. Neo-Soul! So dope! I’m Neo to Soul. And I don’t mean NE-YO. I’m in NY. Oh! And here we go!

Drive me insane
Go ‘head and drive me wild
‘Cause that’s all you do
You never make me smile
Drive me insane
Go ‘head and drive me wild
‘Cause that’s all you do
You never make me smile

So much pressure on my back, I’m becoming metamorphic. But I’m The Sun. I never forfeit. In my old days/in my old age/in my old ways, I was telling everybody I’m like The O’jays! For the Love Of Money. But Who Am I when money is no longer love? The strongest touch is what I look for and look forward to… look. There’s more of you! And there’s so many people I can vent about. And them niggas ain’t listening now. And when they get to listening, I’ll have a kid that shouts. And my baby mama would be THE BIGGEST BITCH. NO DOUBT! My enemy would have my spirit within him. And I can hear him grinning. And everybody else is selfish. Can’t help it. But I’m still Charles Hamilton until you’re melting!

Drive me insane
Go ‘head and drive me wild
‘Cause that’s all you do
You never make me smile
Drive me insane
Go ‘head and drive me wild
‘Cause that’s all you do
You never make me smile

I’m the bastard son of JayLib. Wait a minute! Controversy starts when I get to blurting from the heart about the man who made me so smart with your soul, AND the target of globes. The whole Solar System knows. And I still feel snow, coming down my face. Running around the place. I’m so cold. Ancient. But I’m so dope. Face it. See I go through situations feeling like Goku in The Matrix. Don’t say “woo!” or “hoo!” because you know you gotta face the fact there’s no pen involved with this spaceship. I just wanna be the greatest, if I’m not the one that created shit. While I sip a beer, I be like “Listen here. Heinekens make me wanna smile again… but you?!”

Drive me insane
Go ‘head and drive me wild
‘Cause that’s all you do
You never make me smile
Drive me insane
Go ‘head and drive me wild
‘Cause that’s all you do
You never make me smile
