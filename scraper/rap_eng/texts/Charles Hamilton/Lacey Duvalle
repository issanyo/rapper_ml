Let me start by saying you never know who you can fall in love with watching Eskimo Tube
After a long day of perfecting Pro Tools
What better way to chill to be letting go two
Whoo!
Time to see you know who
My favorite daydream I might be too close to you, Boo
You'll never be my boo
Celebrities are too unheavenly for me but it's everything to you
Maybe you do it to provide for your daughter
I know you got a daughter
I've been known you for the longest
Your neck is the strongest
They try to make you gag
But you give it to fast
So they kind of make you brag
Dag
Maybe it's cause you didn't have a Dad
To beat your pretty ass every time you acted bad
If that's a fact then take me Lacey
You make me crazy
To space you'll take me

I fell in love for miss Lacey
She was hanging with the bang brother boys
I'm in love for miss Lacey
When she screams it's such a beautiful noise
I kinda wish I knew Lacey
Maybe I can get to know who she
But she'll always be Lacey
A superstar in the oldest biz

You and Jada Fire made some fire tapes
You may inspire ways that I can taste but I'm impatient
Why the hate from guys that say your thighs are fake
Like they some kind of saint
I ain't
You make me feel some kind of way
By the way, I need to say
I like your face
When it's not covered in my DNA
But then I again I like to have my genetics
That's why I like like (hah) dag I'm pathetic
I don't know what your goin' through
But when I cheated on you to see Milian Blu
You black and put out another lesbian scene
Which was sexy to me
And it messed with my dreams
Seems, as though your eyes cover something hidden
Maybe that's why you're never stuck in one position
When Tiny's stroking and smacking your hiney
I'd be over here thinking I wish this was Charles inside me

Am I delusional for falling for a pornstar
Cause I wanna learn all about her born scars
Fuck it, guess I'm a womanizer
And she's a man eater
So I can't beat her
But I can see her
Make a man breathe deeper
Or tell my niggas about the way I can treat her
Such a damn diva
Maybe a damned diva
Maybe she gave up when she put on that makeup
Maybe she hates herself when she wakes up
Or maybe Lacey's a name that she made up
Maybe she even thinks getting laid sucks
Or is just unimpressed by all these gay fucks
Hopefully she thinks this shit's retarded
Enough to treat a nigga like Mr. Marcus
She was a little girl in Kindergarten
Now she's the reason why my children are in the carpet, of my apartment
