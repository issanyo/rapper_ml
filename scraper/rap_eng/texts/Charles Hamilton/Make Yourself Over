[Verse 1]
It isn't fair to not share what I dare
But so many people are scared
Honestly why do we care?
Innocent lives lost, sinning beside a cross
Women don't like to talk, I'm only interested in my thoughts
Shit isn't my loss, but when listenting to my bars
It's different, but try Charles
Just to provide it all
I wish I could make you happy all the time when I rhyme
But I think you'll be fine when I decide to decline

Ain't this a bitch
I stay in the mix
My grave is a wish
I wish to be paid
Give me away
What I did in the past
Now I gotta get me the cash
Take a little trip, get some ass
Gotta get a hit for the class
Where my nigga E
Where my nigga Mac
Does it even matter if I'm mad?
Does it even matter if I'm bad?
What do we have?
Justice at last
Never been the type just fuck em and pass
But this is magic
Bust it and laugh
Stuck with the crash
Mustn't be sad
But when at last, I look in the mirror
I see nothing but scratches
Ugly it has been
That's my mask cause
Death needed success
But asking for risk

[Hook]
Lying in the mirror won't get you nowhere
Crying in the mirror won't get you nowhere
Try to get closer, and make yourself over (2x)

[Verse 2]
It's not your talent, man
You gotta have balance
Dag it, I had it
I approach tracks like a savage
Don't laugh at the sadness
I'm genetically predisposed to it
So I make music
Hopefully it's dope, I don't abuse it
I don't have a life outside of this
I'm quiet as shit
Can't get high but I sip
I'm trying to vent
Silence within
Don't ask me how I'm doing
I'm happy when I'm losing
Am I exactly who you're choosing?

Never have I been so down
Forget those clowns
Someone roll the window down
Let me blow the Indo out
No info just doubt
We rolling out
Rolling two deep like cops
Mama know she's my pops
We got shocked
Can we not be topped
My request, why always gotta make a mess
Gotta stay the best
Gansta lean
But a Goth in the flesh
Pac when arrested
Lots of breath, hot to the death
Droppin' next, prophets confess
You ain't see my coming with the hotness that I possess
I am not a Tribe Called Quest
Nor am I Kanye West
Not in jest, still paying [?] chest

[Hook 2x]
Lying in the mirror won't get you nowhere
Crying in the mirror won't get you nowhere
Try to get closer and make yourself over (2x)
