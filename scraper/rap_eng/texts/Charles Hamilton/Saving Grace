[Intro]
Every night I wonder
If it's Hell or Heaven I'm dwellin'?
Does Hell have the pearly gates?
Or is Heaven a deadly robbery at 7 Eleven?

[Verse 1]
I'm not afraid of death
I'm embracin death
So if I take your breath away
Expect the day to rest
The sun comes down underground
Where the hedgehogs be, I am undone now
Broke apart from the broken heart
I know the stars are in alignment
For Charles' assignment
How simple is this
My only mission is to live and exist
I was given a gift difference is
I was made in God's image, ya dig?
So I guess it was me that presented the gift
Accented with a twist
I get it how I live
I live just to live
I give a fuck if
You don't consider fuck a curse word
So in this matrix, I am just a cursor
God tight
The sky light
My life is in the games highlight
Gettin high ever night to fight my plight
Now my mic got me livin in the high life
So fuck you rappers and ya bikes and ya chains
This is my way sadness that can brighten ya day

[Hook]
God gave me style
God gave me grace (God give my style God give me grace)
God put a smile on my face (God put a smile on my face)
God make me shine like the sun (God make me shine like the sun)
Sometimes I feel like I'm the one
Yep I'm pretty sure

[Verse 2]
I make mixtapes to talk about the right now
I make albums to talk about my lifestyle
I make music to pump my heart
A perfect 10, November is the month I start
WHOA
Is me
This beat
Gets me to the state of mind where I can live free
9th grade insecure couldn't get numbers
Spent time between writin, beats, and pichunter
This summer I'm Charlie DiCaprio
Hardly happy but I ain't walkin sadly tho
I am so at peace, I'd call my daddy, yo
If he even existed to me
Dead or alive no difference to me
Either way his soul is distant to me
I ain't grow to be what mom wants me to be
So what my nigga, Psalm 23

[Hook]
God gave me style
God gave me grace (God give my style God give me grace)
God put a smile on my face (God put a smile on my face)
God make me shine like the sun (God make me shine like the sun)
Sometimes I feel like I'm the one
Yep I'm pretty sure

[Break]
It ain't my fault!
I just reached the style I'm hot I break it down
It ain't my fault!
You can't break it down the way I break it down
It ain't my fault!
I just reached the style I'm hot I break it down
It ain't my fault!
You can't break it down the way I break it down
