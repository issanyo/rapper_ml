[Verse 1]
I wondered about you last night
Died the last time I did it
I did you wrong, I admit it
Sold out for a pink fitted, get it?
Sex is a weapon, haven't seen you in a minute
How you living?
You're always on my mind even if I am tripping
Broken hearts mend, my shit didn't
You became a victim, I became a hitlist
I wish you would visit, peppermint kisses
Psychic distance and the shit I envision
You are truly gifted, I hope you listen
You're like my only mission
Otherwise, life is different

[Hook]
Have you wondered where I've been
Do you wonder where I go
Is it fun where you might live
It's not fun when you alone

Wish I were a starlight
To land in a hard volcano
Wish I were a starlight
To land in a hard volcano

[Verse 2]
Do you still think I'm attractive
I hope you know our chemistry was magic
My life without you has been sadness
I rollercoaster ride, unfastened
I seem ending worlds, the sky fades and people laughing
And no concern as the sky blackens
My words are clear but life is dragging
I might be older than I imagine
That's word to any spell casted
That's word to any song drafted
I miss my starlight
What we had could've lasted
Now I'm back to the last sip of last kiss
The glass tips, you call me again
Who are we to begin with
You don't even get it
My fate, have we ended
Destiny is quite tragic

[Hook]
Have you wondered where I've been
Do you wonder where I go
Is it fun where you might live
It's not fun when you alone

Wish I were a starlight
To land in a hard volcano
Wish I were a starlight
To land in a hard volcano

[Outro]
I probably won't believe anything
Until I hear and feel
So you have to answer my call
And I know I just mailed you my number every 10 minutes
But, you're all I have to believe in
Or I'm just figuring out how psychic I am
And it's really not really to
Honestly, make sure everything goes right....
(You can figure out the rest, these song effects kill me...-K.M.)

[Hook]
Have you wondered where I've been
Do you wonder where I go
Is it fun where you might live
It's not fun when you alone

Wish I were a starlight
To land in a hard volcano
Wish I were a starlight
To land in a hard volcano
