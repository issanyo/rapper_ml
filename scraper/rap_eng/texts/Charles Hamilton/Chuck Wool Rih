I requested a kiss from Mystic. Her lipstick was *too* ballistic to kiss the dick. But at the same time, I'm practicing rhyme(s) and have to get my fine line from Divine. A. (Davina) I'm pressing it! HEY! (sigh) Nothing but a lesson today. Stressing, go away. I laid down with all my blessings. Effervescent, Effervescent plays. Sorry. Evanescence. My song today! My Immortal. Am I in a portal? I do not bore you, but when I court you, I want to see a door with you walking through. Your ass so fat. Damn. I just need to have a chat. Not just Mystic, but all the mystical chicks who've been tickling the pickle just for kicks

Yes, I do fall for the dating game
I do. See? It's a dating game
I do. DAMN! What a God damn shame...
I fall in love in the dating game...

Since I let my senses die inside of SimMINE, I'm losing all kind of senses. I'm... just dying inside. "It's my time." Now, if she's my bride, then that (here) is where I have to say goodbye to Sasheer. Play in the Z-A-Y! The Z. Pardon me. Passing away. Her ass and her shape is amazing! Daft Punk, okay! Brainwash me! Talk to me! Go off on me! Going off and on! A light switch. But, with the NightSwitch, we become Crescendolls! And then, Charles just loses all his senses (again) inside of one of them dolls. "One that we created" OR "one that we have stated" OR "something more..." Something LESS, when you get undressed! Cum on!

"God damn!" I'm Drunk In Love. And I got an Anaconda. Your number's up(. I wanna make love to BOTH OF Y'ALL, same time, blindfolded. A lot of baby oil. I'm open, and I'm hoping. Coke in... and out of my system. Cocaine in and out of the linen. With the Coke is mixed with the Henny. I got plenty! I'M BUSSIN' LIKE A SEMI! Get rid of me, please! You gotta gimme, JIGGA, or you not my nigga infinitely. Some things I just CAN'T believe! How could this POSSIBLY be prophecy? GOD DAMN! Y'all consistently with me! Existing with me! That means... you dig me! Infinitely wishing to be kissing the chic(k) who fits in her jeans
