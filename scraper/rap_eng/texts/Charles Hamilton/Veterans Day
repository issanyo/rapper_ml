[Intro: brandUn DeShay]
Uh, brandUn DeShay
Yeah

[Verse 1: brandUn DeShay]
This is better than I imagined
My future looking so good, it could be a fashion
My future looking so good, it could win a pageant
Someone give it a sash and send it down the runway, everybody is clapping
Applause, applause, leave them with no words
They speechless, got a leg up like them showgirls
They swear they gon' make it, they talking, they so sure
But they ain't got the drive like me, they chauffeured
No duh, 'cause I'm the one and the only
You don't like me? Pretend I'm hot food and blow me
Leave me alone like an island, [?]
You do it for the homies? I do it for the honeys
You do it for the money? I do it for the mam√≠s
I'm selfish, what you want from me?
I just made 20, so I'm still a rugrat like Tommy
But it's better this way
Still a rookie, but we celebrating...

[Chorus: Charles Hamilton & brandUn DeShay]
Veterans Day
And everybody know who I am, even though I'm pretty sure you don't
Veterans Day
Give me love I deserve, pretty sure I'm pretty sure you don't
Veterans Day
It's 11/11 again, it's 11/11 again
It's 11/11 again
The day after my birthday is

[Verse 2: Charles Hamilton]
Maybe I'll be the greatest alive the day that I die
Hatred is fine, I cannot wait for the time
I drop album after album
And you sit in the studio, realizing you're wasting your time
The game isn't mine; the motherfucking console is
Charles Sega, Carl Sagan, on some Cosmos shit
Get hated by those who do not know shit
They pot roasting my lyrical osmosis
I gotta fight to be one of the individuals
I got a right to be someone none of you niggas know
I sit at home, I'm trying to keep my sanity
Wanna nut in my girl so I can feed my family
Wanna smoke a pound of haze, blow an ounce of yay
Overdose, but I know I told you folks I found a way
Out the caves that my mind designed
So you don't mind, I don't, it's my time to shine

[Chorus: Charles Hamilton & brandUn DeShay]
Veterans Day
And everybody know who I am, even though I'm pretty sure you don't
Veterans Day
Give me love I deserve, pretty sure I'm pretty sure you don't
Veterans Day
It's 11/11 again, it's 11/11 again
It's 11/11 again
The day after my birthday is

[Verse 3: brandUn DeShay]
They say 'cause I appeal like a orange, all the girls got a crush on me
Never been bullied, but everybody pushing me to greatness
So all of that hating don't mean much to me
'Cause ain't nobody touching me, molesters get custody
And they try to question me, thinking I'm the shit
I ain't shit, I'm trying to change the world before I split
See? Now, that's the problem: cats got these one-track minds
And I got a whole album for mine
I heard they out the box, these boys is out of they mind
No cuts, no buts, no coconuts, they out of the line
They best to head to self-checkout
Trying to stand up to these vampires, they biting
Welp, you shouldn't have stuck your neck out
Really thought he need to smoke, the way this nigga stepped out
Treat him like details, always getting left out
Nah, I ain't never lift, but I got a rep now
From Chi-Town, so I gotta rep now, best out

[Chorus: Charles Hamilton & brandUn DeShay]
Veterans Day
And everybody know who I am, even though I'm pretty sure you don't
Veterans Day
Give me love I deserve, pretty sure I'm pretty sure you don't
Veterans Day
It's 11/11 again, it's 11/11 again
It's 11/11 again
The day after my birthday is

[Outro: brandUn DeShay]
Veterans Day
Veterans Day
Veterans, Veterans Day
