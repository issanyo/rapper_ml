And I ain't even see the movie

[Verse I]
I'm the rap Holyfield
I stay gettin' bitten
Did I spit the line before?
Okay, It was written
With pen and paper, I get so graceful and smitten
I can take my written to dinner and pay to hit it
My verse is like, "The dollar is paper, and I'm paper, am I bi?"
I fold my verse in two, and call it using spanish fly
Smokin' dandelions, Locked up and I'm high
Destiny glued my hand to her thigh
Damn I'm fly, My verse is like, "DAMN, guy! Answer my question! Am I BI?!"
I said, "You're straight up fuckin' ill"
And I make free music, so keep fuckin' still
Caught chlamydia, but I keep fuckin' still
I get it up like a Rude Boy, Trust my skills
Lust is ill, I give my verse a couple bills
It hugs me for being so fuckin' ill

[Hook]
My bars are Mr. Popper's Penguins
My beats are Mr. Popper's Penguins
I get it poppin, I'm poppin, I get it poppin
I'm Mr. Poppers, let's get it, I get it poppin
...

[Verse II]
When my ear hits the ring floor
I hear myself get asked what I sing for
I give a mean roar, My roar demeans roars
But in a fight? I go down like 3 Doors, I should swing more
Or maybe I should think less
I'm so high, I could drink meth at a pee test
I'm locked up and sober, prescribed lithium again
Eyes lookin' pretty slim again
An idiot to them, but them are idiots, so, then again
Jamarris was real, yellow is caution
I stare at the thought, and I further glare at being nauseous
I'm on prison precaution
My friends are my beasts
A- shit..my *beats, Same shit at least
My brothers are my bars, and both of them fuck with me always
I get 'em stuck in your mind's hallway (My bars are Mr. Popper's Penguins)
Echo like Boyd, never light noise
Karma's vagina is extra tight and moist

My beats are Mr. Popper's Penguins
I get it poppin, I'm poppin, I get it poppin
I'm Mr. Poppers, let's get it, I get it poppin

Somewhere between genius and pathetic
Only fellow geniuses would get it
Everybody's not a genius, so forget it
So give a pathetic genius some credit
