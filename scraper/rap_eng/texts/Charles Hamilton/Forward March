[Verse]
The psychedelic relic of light and heaven has eyes of diamonds
Pi is the message, sign of the times decides the direction
Saying hi to pleasant wide-eyed and thespian in writing
A lesbian hypothetical in with a hyphen
Medical writings from a guy in bed with fine, dine women are privately letting my exorcism cry
Stretch it from inside to let the vice of expression
Crime oppression, suggest that rhyme is quite as fine as the present
The gift is in the verses, the present is in the beat
The blessing is when the verses enter the present to be a treat
Benevolent is the person who never gets a piece of the blessing
When blessing people with the present as we speak
Better it would seem, and let me intervene, You're right
Tetris is a speech and in every letter I could write is pepper in the doctor's diet
I can never be reached of saying "if" wasn't an effort of forever to make me believe
Reverend of the free
Reverb the plate of the collection
All to be abundant and Charles to be a hundred
My wizardry is a mystery but I isn't kidding
J.K. Rowling when I wanna be naughty
When hungry you wanna vent?
Just kidding
Charles is all you're gonna get
Until and unless you feeling possessed to heal what is left on my heel and the best be the one I'm with, heel
Shit
Still the king of the tree house
Bringing "then" to senile
Speed out of the mouthpiece of mouths and those who speak loud when using the music as a key out of what we see now
Turn my head and hear a great meow
Read in, breathe in, be out
Heathens see the end and begin to frisbee doubt to that bitch
Who's 22 and don't know what catch is
Won't grow up
Just throw up to this load of catfish

[Hook]
Toys and toys and toys galore
I know you're a little boy enjoying the toy store
Ain't nobody tryn'a play with me
Ain't nobody tryn'a play with me
Grow up you little know-it-all
Grow up you little know-it-all
I'm five years ahead of my time [times two]
I'm lightyears ahead of my time
[Times you]
