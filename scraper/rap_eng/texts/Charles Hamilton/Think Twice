Pause
Stop
And just think about things

[Verse 1: Yung Nate]
Life keeps goin’
Life of a don
Switching up clothes like the (?)
Different from his baby mom—ma’s
Somebody should have told him you’s a goner
How many kids you gon’ birth, that never know they father?
Child support got em’ looking for you like Osama
Pardon me partner, know you wanna grind like a farmer and when Christmas come you always call em
What’s gonna happen when they get a little taller? See their life expectancy get a little shorter?
Now you wanna see them but they already grown up trying to offer them juice but they drink Coronas
Blame it on the youth, yourself feels tortured
Just want some time to talk but they don’t want to talk much
Ain’t that a bitch?
Blame it on the karma
Finish what you need to do before the things you wanna

[Hook]
You wildin out, and you gotta chill
Before it gets out of hand
Without a doubt, you know that it’s real
I know you understand
Think twice
You only get one time to act
You only get one time to act
Think twice
You only get one time to act
Think twice
You only get one time to act

[Verse 2: Charles Hamilton]
Give me a break like I put my two weeks in
15 days later still trying to figure where do we end
I only wanted to be friends but the cutie then said “move me in”
A direction I never saw coming
Led by an erection I never saw coming
I got you nervous with the words that imma spit but is it worth it simply getting service from your lips
It’s, why I never kiss and tell
I fucking rap enough of that miss listen well
A grant no, but don’t expect no X-O-X-O text cause I get you so wet
Did I bone, yes
Here’s a bone fetch
I don’t let women into my zone and you prove why I can’t let you into my zone yet
I’d rather be alone don’t protest, bet

[Hook]
You wildin out, and you gotta chill
Before it gets out of hand
Without a doubt, you know that it’s real
I know you understand
Think twice
You only get one time to act
You only get one time to act
Think twice
You only get one time to act
Think twice
You only get one time to act

[Verse 3: Show Tufli]
Now I grew up in the means streets
I never seen peace
I only seen beef and I seen cheese, and I seen niggas eat cheese, rat ass niggas and I laugh at niggas cause they can’t see me
On your T.V. sicker than V.D., holla
I gotta get the dollar
No job but momma want me to be a scholar
But I think I might follow, footsteps of my poppa so
I go get a O, so I can get fly and go prada, flow
Stack chips get a lotta, dough
Can’t slip cause 5-0 wanna see you die slow
Niggas copping, got me on grind mode
But when you’re locked in god damn, times slow
Let me chill at least I’m free if I’m broke pick up the pen the studio’s where I go

[Hook]
You wildin out, and you gotta chill
Before it gets out of hand
Without a doubt, you know that it’s real
I know you understand
Think twice
You only get one time to act
You only get one time to act
Think twice
You only get one time to act
Think twice
You only get one time to act
