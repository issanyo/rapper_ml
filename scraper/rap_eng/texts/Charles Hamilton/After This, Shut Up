Howard burn C.E.O. of Demevolist Inc

Yo Hch, you wanna help me out here? You gon' help me talk some knowledge?

(Hcho Talking)
I'm actually a little afraid..

(Charles main verse)
I'm in the booth, pitch black
Still working out with no six pack.. Did you get that?
Sick rap is all I'm tryna spit, that..
Is a fact I've been sleepin' on a mattress
That is what I call a music bed
Let this verse abuse your head
You dudes is dead
I ain't even tryna do handshakes
I can't wait, ya man hate, ya man die
Every time ya man lie can't stand how I could be the man behind it
I never get blinded or blind sided
30 years old tryna do what I did in the future
You must be the suicide kid..
But you don't know what suicide is
That's trying your luck
I don't even want to talk to you, I'm riding for shucks
For the fuck of it.. Coming up with new phrases
I'm on a new stage, sonic in new stages..

(HchO Talking)
We 'bout to bring back the old..
Too slow vibe..
Cause we don't fuck with any of you

Coming back to the sound of the 808
This is pain you can't take away
That hate just made my day
Youtube it.. You stupid
Throwin' darts like you cupid
You ruthless? Never
Only when I take ya top off, got problems?
Then pop off, ya girl wanna top off, my cock is like hot sauce
Sprayin' on her food, decayin' all the rules
Niggas is dead you heard what I said
I'm a bird in the air got a bird in my head when I'm flyin'
So high I am the reason why my clothes don't need an iron
Still straight..
Kill plates..
Nobody gon' kill Hch
Split it down the middle if you want
It's still symmetrical, let you know
I got the best flow from here to Mexico
Still landin' on the border.. A scorer
Simone Porter, she is not a more-a
She's more like a Hamilton, still standin' next to him
Hand in hand with him, Talk to 'em Hch!

(Hcho Talking)
What the fuck do you want me to say after that?
Aw man..
More..? More?

(Charles main verse)
Y'all niggas sound like Disney with rap
Mickey with facts, spittin' the crack
See I tried to not be the cocky ass backwards, but now I see
I gotta be the I C champion, inter-continental flyin' like continental
But I'm delta, bring the helta skelta
Bring any beef I will melt ya
Filet mignon that's the steak on my plate
I ain't make a mistake just yet
If I make a mistake then nigga bet
Like B.E.T., easily, you get wet
You can just drown in my tears
I got this sound for years
Down here
I ball from my nut sack y'all niggas ride around with a bus pass
Fuck that
I should be the one you congratulate my nature
I graduated, I hate ya
HchO drivin' a navigator
And I'm still a star, killin' bars, ain't nobody feelin' Charles?
They might as well be killin' Charles
Off with his head
Never will I be talkin' to feds cause my lawyer got this shit down pact
I'm around like pac.. 2
Act 2

(HchO)
Yo.. Charles, I always knew..
...Fuck outta here, haha

(Charles main verse)
I got locked and my girl wrote a blog sayin' "Free Charles"
Now I'm with a DJ, we playin' Skee ball
Rollin' up, yeah whattup my nigga?
And you, you fucking suck my nigga
I'm talking to you
You been hating for the longest
That's why this song is just me gettin' along with
The melody, I'm just spittin' like it's a felony
And my bars are still heavenly, tell 'em b
U.. R, K, E
You can't splay me, display me, spray me
Whatever the word is that I just said
Will make a lot of sense to all my favorite dust heads

(HchO)
You got fire...
All the rest of you cats is fired..
Fire..

(Charles Main verse/outro)
What more can I say?
Niggas is dead, I mean the organist way
It's a funeral, y'all..
Assume that it's Charles still bangin' in ya ear lobe
You don't like it? Then I guess you gotta hear Hov
What more can I say?

Fuck this.. And I bit the ending!
