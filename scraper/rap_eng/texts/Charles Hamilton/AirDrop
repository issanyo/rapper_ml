I used to dream to be in the sky. Now it's obscene to be in the sky. It seems like in the sky is men who need dykes to get them by. I'm living by the rhythm as I decide what to do with them. I want to move again. Then I die. Then I'm alive. Then defy them for Atari. SEGA, I'm sorry but later aI guard thee. You make me sorry for living just for being so beautiful and gifted. All of y'all! I want the party to start. If I could DJ, I would need 3 days to make everybody want me to replay the same song that got them off their feet. Enter gravity, talk to me

It's hard to smile when my style has been the whole state of mind of people basically not even giving a blink to anything but evil (success). Must I be upset? Bust nuts, yes. But I must guess just to keep everybody far from upset. But I could be the target, just yet! I could take your love, I could take your hate, your punches, and your sacred waves.
