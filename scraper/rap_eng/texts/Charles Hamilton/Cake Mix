I woke up in a zone, in a home, wishing I was getting dome. But in a zone where getting dome would put a nigga in a zone from these niggas getting dome. Wow, dome and zone. I have a zone in my dome. No one is taking me out of my home. Proud as I roam when I see people trying to shout out my loneliness. So I get so down, niggas try to get out of my zone and realize they're inside of my dome. Don't get mad when I get a pistol and then get invited by the chrome to have a bullet meeting. I don't want you in my mind, anyway. Get out of my dome, get out of my dome How will I know if I commit suicide? By blasting it, ratchet


I used to wake up sorry
Now-a days I wake up gnarly
Real niggas saying, "Say what, Charlie?"
Real ladies saying, "Wake up, Charlie!"

I've been praying for consistency. People are copying me, laying for a missing me. So this is a misdemeanor. My demeanor has been missing. I've been getting cleaner with masking my emotions. people are hoping I would try to die again. From my diaphragm I scream "I am inside of my within." And I am proud to be the guy who's spitting right now. You can lay a doubt down now. I found out how I can be consistent with my consistency. Longevity, not brevity.

Music is Mt. Kilimanjaro and I climb it. I'm continually reaching until I reach a higher climate. But even when I reach the top i'm still not as hot as the heat I got by looking at the sun when I am on top of the peak. So I consistently reach, climb to the clouds. Then I find out I can drown when I fall into the ocean, whatever is surrounding. So this sound thing should not be clowning me. I am only down for me, and those who are down for me are who I'm down with. So now it's about finding an outfit that's dry. because I just kissed the sky and there's now a downpour. You found out, war. Time for peace, I'm loud more
