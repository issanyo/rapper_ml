Billionaire Bullshit
Billionaire Bullshit

First time I dropped a single wasn't able to chart
Hit Facebook now I aim for your hearts
Poking and shit, hoping this gets
Somewhere deep into your IP address
Because I need you to address
Who could have you undressing
Quicker than the dude giving lessons
And then dress ya quickly
Before I get so sickening
On my billionaire bullshit
I rip beats, then I tape them, penetrate them
I named Interscope the Hamilton Administration
And now they still pen-and-papering
Trying to figure out how they can make the next Charles
Exit Stage Right, I'm the best Charles
And the next Charles gonna have to accept they are the next Charles
Cause I'm on my billionaire bullshit
Bottom niggas with a MetroCard, like "Let's go hard," on my billionaire bullshit
I'm the next to be a star, because I'm still stuck as a star and this is billionaire bullshit
Celebrity ain't a star
Buying a celebrity from the stars, on some billionaire bullshit
Billionaire bullshit

If Facebook wasn't a psychic experience
Then Mark Zuckerberg owes me his fucking life
Hear this shit, hear me clearly
Because it is time for me to show you the origin of the site
I was staring at this girl, kinda light
Skinned with dreads, I was a skinhead
Listening Eminem "Encore" on 4
She was Silver, on some billionaire bullshit
She clicked on the site while she pointed at my forehead
I'm thinking of her at the middle of the night
Or in the middle of the night
Gave a little wiggle of the hips and I was like "I'm in there, alright!"
But no, I looked at the screen
And my button-up showed she was looking at me
And all that I can show from my psychic show
Call it pyro or call it billionaire bullshit
She sent a billionaire bullets to the screen
Now that's some billionaire bullshit
I see a bunch of names see some pictures of some ex-flames on some billionaire bullshit
I feel chills in the air, wasn't the air conditioning it's billionaire bullshit
She hit me with a billionaire full clip
Now I'm fucking dying from this billionaire bullshit
Still didn't see a dime
But I saw a dime so I kinda need the dime to really be the dime
I actually thought her to be
Silver the Hedgehog are you walking with me?
But that's SEGA, and I'm a player
So says Pun, so I'm so deadly from step 1
When I give you my I'm-so-next puns
Sorry next one I'm on that billionaire bullshit
Seven letters in the name and the last name is a ten dollar bill
So you're the last name that I gotta feel
Low self-esteem
I ain't gotta help the team, y'all know
Cause if y'all don't we are not a team
From the Dream Team
Like Chicago entrance theme are you listening?
Mike Jordan on some billionaire bullshit
Pulitzer
Got a gun pull it that's a billionaire bullet
Coming from the gun of the chick who had full hips
Pointing at some billionaire bullshit
Load it cock it aim it
Explain that shit it on some billionaire bullshit
Charles Hamilton Mark Zuckerberg
Just the syllables in conjunction is billionaire bullshit
Now I got Google, now I got Apple
That's billionaire true shit
Billionaire in the booth and he's staring at dude who doesn't care for nothing but that billionaire bullshit
From the bottom of the block to the bottom of the blocks on some billionaire...
Yo
