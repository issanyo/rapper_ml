Bliss is so irresistible. I wanna kiss you low. But then I gotta grip your throat and remind you that the sky and below is where I find you. I didn't know that you like the below that I find you in when I'm climbing in, but since I'm the guy to find you in your nightware in my nightmares, I begin. I need to start speaking from the heart. People have departed from me, and I don't know why. Probably 'cause of some old guy. But the old guy floats by, by my side. I ain't even mad at him. I ain't even gonna say the shit was an accident. I'm more mad about my chattin' mouth not having nothing to rap about. So give it to me

I strive for good, then I'm taken out
Of my neighborhood, and given sacred doubt
I just can't fight the feeling
I just can't fight the night

I am my own worse critic, but with every verse it's demented. My critics are critics. CRITTERS. Pardon me niggers, but I ain't tryna sit in the picture while you figure I am not trying to get you to be a digger. I am not Dirk Diggler, but my dick is big enough to hit up a nigga wife and have that bitch asking for the pipe every night, even when I'm not around. So she gotta sit tight and recite her favorite song of mine to keep her mind strong. Because she knows my python goes quite long. I like talkin' 'bout sex. I'm the S-C-O (SEO)-or-pion. Score again. I don't use force, but then, when I do, I force your force to end

I strive for good, then I'm taken out
Of my neighborhood, and given sacred doubt
I just can't fight the feeling
I just can't fight the night

I soak(ed) in pain. Going in the game. Choking niggas names. Knowing what the game is, and aimlessly walking it. Stalking niggas, and then talking for minutes. The minutes that I'm talkin' has them offin' niggas who come in talkin' 'bout puttin niggas in coffins... then again, that kind of shit sells. So I gotta do this shit for myself. Providing for my mother, and that makes me mad. Because I really can't stand her crazy ass. But I love her. How could I not? Probably because she like when I "loud and rock". Am I allowed to rock at my volume without a Valium or a costume? God, soon! Maybe Satan. But that's just the way I'm laying. Come on, now...

I strive for good, then I'm taken out
Of my neighborhood, and given sacred doubt
I just can't fight the feeling
I just can't fight the night
