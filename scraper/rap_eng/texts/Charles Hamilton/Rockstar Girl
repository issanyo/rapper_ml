Green Lantern, drop that shit

[Intro]
Now I'll relate this little bit (x3)
That happens more than I'd like to admit
Late at night she knocks on my door
Drunk again and looking to score
I know I should say no
But that's kind of hard when she's ready to go
I may be dumb
But I'm not a dweeb
I'm just a sucker with no self esteem

[Verse 1]

I met this rockstar girl in school
She would be in class, I be cuttin' like a fool
She had a good average and I broke rules
I had a crush and she didn't have a clue
I was to myself, but I hung with a crew
She was to herself, but she had a crew too
I dropped out and she paid her dues
And in due time we saw how things grew
It all started out by us talking on Aim
She was so shocked that I knew her name
She would date dudes that I knew were lame
She knew I had body, so she knew my game
Or did she?
If so, she would lose this game
If only she would listen to the new kid's slang
Cause he be doin' his music thing
So it's only right he kiss when the music played

[Hook]
There's no reason to feel, alone, because
There's somebody who feels, the same, yeah
So if ever you feel alone
Just know that you can call my name, my name

[Verse 2]
Our first date was The Devil Wears Prada
I was so proud of the fact that I got her
She was with a lot of old friends from the high school that we first met at
That was not a problem
Only one setback, they would all gossip
And they would all start up problems
I just watched 'em closely, cause they don't really know me
And they don't really know we, feelings bitter slowly
We stayed friends
I dealt with lame chicks, she dealt with lame nigs that dealt the same shit
I told her how I felt, she felt the same then
Eventually what we had felt had came in, to play
Invited me over, I came in to play
We had no statements to say
I love you is just a statement away
But before we take the plunge, the day drifts away
But we still know

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
After the kiss everything was so fine
Thoughts of her kiss invaded my mind
She might be mine
But of course it's time, for her friends to chime and cross that line
I'm, mindin' my Bi after gettin' tree high
Here come my friends tryin' to tell me how
After tellin' me high, they all get to talkin'
Charles, she's a tease and ya'll would be awkward
Givin' me opinions, names I won't mention
And me bein' a dummy, I had to listen
Now she's missin'
Coulda been romantic, damn it
Romantic chances get damaged
And it's what happens when friends get to yappin'
We both insecure and afraid to take action
But if she sleeps, I help her dreams and her (low self esteem)

[Hook x2]
