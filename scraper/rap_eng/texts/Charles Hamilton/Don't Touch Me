[Verse 1]
Why I gotta wait till the beat drop
9th Wonder, heat rock, come on the track like MMMM, Nigga
Fuck outta here
This is my game, fuck outta here
NES flow, shoot a duck out the air

(Track Restarts)

Come on the track like MMMM, Nigga
Fuck outta here
This is my game, fuck outta here
NES flow, shoot a duck out the air
*Buck-ow, buck-ow* shut down my peers
Charles Hamilton, my name make the track sound
How it's just supposed to sound, stay in the background
Got Billy in my Jeans, put my Mac down
Like I gotta girls top on my lap now
Y'all been fucking up the game with your whack sound
So take a nap in the casket and back down
Or face down, let the base pound
I walk the streets in the prettiest slippers
I'm the golden child, the little indian nigga
So drink water, let the flame go down
If the fire in my eyes still ain't go down
Only, only takes one to tango now
I've been waiting for a minute to find a beat to masturbate on
Feeling myself, watch me ejaculate
Ironically, I ended up in Michael Jackson's place
As an 8 year old, that be rapping great
I walk, you see the disco flash
Step in my way, I will kick your ass
Hee-Hee, Mr. ET
Outer space with the bars, if you see me...

[Hook]
Don't touch me nigga, don't touch me
It's just me nigga, don't rush me
It's ugly but these hoes love me, mad I ain't their boyfriend but...
I am the one!

Don't touch me nigga, don't touch me
It's just me nigga, don't rush me
Hamilton is 8 letters, Charles is 7
Take one from the other...
I am the one!

[Verse 2]
There is no other, so butter
I am on some shit that's so other
You can't even think my name without repeating it
So how you gonna bite my bars thinking you won't stutter
So fucker, that's what your girl call you
She say "So?", when I fuck her
When you say "so?", I so fuck her
I get a boost with no uppers
You a stupid scuba Steve with no rubber
I'm a rash you can't remove in cocoa butter
Charles is trash, the phrase that you won't utter
So where you at before to buck it
I'm the new LL, the old lover
With a new swag, I even got smoke smothered
Yo Mike, I know you hear this shit
Be a real nigga, clear this shit
To make every MC fear this shit
Two thousand H, this year is it
Tag, nobody is near this shit
Try to hate is a dire mistake, I am great
And you my manager, just another nigga trying to violate, my mistake

[Hook]
Don't touch me nigga, don't touch me
It's just me nigga, don't rush me
It's ugly but these hoes love me, mad I ain't their boyfriend but...
I am the one!

Don't touch me nigga, don't touch me
It's just me nigga, don't rush me
Hamilton is 8 letters, Charles is 7
Take one from the other...
I am the one!

How you want it, how you want it, I'm back
How you want it, how you want it, how you want it, I'm back
How you want it, how you want it, I'm back
How you want it, I'm back, I'm back, I'm back
How you want it, how you want it, I'm back
How you want it, how you want it, how you want it, I'm back
How you want it, how you want it, I'm back
How you want it, I'm back, I'm back, I'm back

Don't touch me nigga, don't touch me
It's just me nigga, don't rush me
It's ugly but these hoes love me, mad I ain't their boyfriend but...
I am the one!

Don't touch me nigga, don't touch me
It's just me nigga, don't rush me
Hamilton is 8 letters, Charles is 7
Take one from the other...
I am the one!

Don't touch me nigga, don't touch me
It's just me nigga, don't rush me
It's ugly but these hoes love me, mad I ain't their boyfriend but...
I am the one!

Don't touch me nigga, don't touch me
It's just me nigga, don't rush me
Hamilton is 8 letters, Charles is 7
Take one from the other...
I am the one!
