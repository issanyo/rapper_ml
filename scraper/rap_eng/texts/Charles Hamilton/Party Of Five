[Verse 1]
How did we end up here?
Put the beginnin' in hell to put the end up here
In heaven with us no one can get us here
I kept my end up, keep ya end up dear
We kiss and make up, end up smeared
No mascara on your skin just tears
But the more you cry your soul is purified
I know the visions in ya head get you mortified
Thoughts of bitches in our bed get you horrified
Cause they quick to give me head to be immortalized
But I can't see torcher in ya gorgeous eyes
Can't explain to God why my live poured her eyes out just cause of me
All just to be another fool singin' it wasn't me, ya just for me
And nothing could change it
The challenge is balanced, such a lovely arrangement
Where the day went...

I wonder...
I wonder...
Who, what, when, where, why and how this can be?
I wonder...
I wonder...
Who, what, when, where, why and how this can be?

[Verse 2]
It seems so grim, light seems so dim
But don't they always when we go in?
Feel like committing the meatloafs in
Do anything for love what he won't then
Bring those sins to kinkos and add a new color
Love is pure it all started from two lovers
Who doesn't wanna be me, receive, what we all fell victim from love's true colors
I'm high off you, my thoughts are intense
Only when I come down do you start to make sense
The ultimate friendship is harder to get
When the same spark that you lit can cause me a glitch
Why worry? Worry makes my eyes blurry
I wanna see straight 30 passed 5:30
That's why I need you to keep my mind sturdy
Had to say it out loud to make sure that I heard me...

[Hook]
I wonder...
I wonder...
Who, what, when, where, why and how this can be?
I wonder...
I wonder...
Who, what, when, where, why and how this can be?

[Bridge]
I am the ghost that haunts you in your dreams
I am your friend...
I am the nightmares that make you scream
I am pretend...
I am the moment that you will never see
I am the end...
I am the alphabet, so just be
And begin... what never ends...

[Whispers of the Bridge]
I am the ghost that haunts you in your dreams
I am your friend...
I am the nightmares that make you scream
I am pretend...
I am the moment that you will never see
I am the end...
I am the alphabet, so just be
And begin... what never ends...

[Hook]
I wonder...
I wonder...
Who, what, when, where, why and how this can be?
I wonder...
I wonder...
Who, what, when, where, why and how this can be?
