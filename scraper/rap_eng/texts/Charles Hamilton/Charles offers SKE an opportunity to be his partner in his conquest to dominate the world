So he hit me
And he took the girl that gave me my first hickey
What a pretty little predicament that I be in
I had to find his website on my IBM
So I can see him
I envy him because he’s the MVP of existence
And I’m nothing to him
I wanna give him a hug
I wanna let him know that even gothics can be thugs
But these other fucking goths ain’t got shit on me
They’re fucking posh and they shit on me for being dark
Fuck Tyler, fuck Earl
Fuck all they girls but you’re the dude who rules the world
At least in my book so just don’t hit me when I look at your dough and your ice and your chain i have the nicest brain (pause) and my chick is a nice dame hey

Super Bully can I be your friend
I’ll be your Super Buddy we’re friends to the end
We’ll take over the whole world
(Because I got Apple, Google and whatever Internet, whatever)
And he said
Sit yo ass down (nigga)
Sit yo ass down

Man, All because of mads
Mad magazine, fucking cost cash
Last magazine was worst than the last
Fucking made me want to leave my wrist with a gash
Just laugh, OK. I’m kind of corny. Fucking high school bores me. And she’s my shorty
Even though there was a rumor of her fucking you in an orgy
Or she is psychic like me, she kinda likes me
Because I got an IQ which mirrors every number on her ID
From the date to the social
And I date her to be social
And to be vocal I’m nice with this rap shit
So you and the psychic can make it happen, captain
And I ain’t cappin, I’m just good at rapping
You and I would be like the snot and the napkin


Super Bully can I be your friend
I’ll be your super buddy we’re friends to the end
We’ll take over the whole world
(Because I got Apple, Google and whatever Internet, whatever)
And he said
Sit yo ass down (nigga)
Sit yo ass down

Had to disrespect him
No room for apologies so I didn’t accept them
I just had to press him
He a Herb so he got what he deserved
Either he either gonna get served or get placed on the curb
That’s my word
Hit him with a bird told him bring it all back
Bring me all the money nigga that’s a real fact
I got his bitch, got his whip got his strip
Everything that he got, shit is hot
So I gotta give thanks for this dweeb
Can’t believe that he moved on my block just for me
Stole his Playstation 3 and his Sonic CD
And his old Sega Genesis came with it for free
Two controllers and folder full of cheat codes
Plus a gun that makes me shoot at the wall every single time I want to reload
Pink shirts in the closet got me looking for cash
But all i found was garbage pail kids up in the stash
Beautiful bitch nice tits with a beautiful ass
And a brand new car fully loaded with cash
And I’m out
