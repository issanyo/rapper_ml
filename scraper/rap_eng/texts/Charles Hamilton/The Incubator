[Verse 1]
The youngest nigga in the industry
Interested in polygamy
Trust, your not the only one to
Admit that you’re digging me
Take a hit of weed then visit me
In the Z-
-O-N-E
Way too much heart for you to o-wn me
The rap game pussy
Only thing over me is ovaries
If rap is pussy and music is my main chick
Life is my shorty and I don’t use her for the brain, shit
She’s just the right height, and I don’t like hype
So I chill out. Fill out an application
To work it, mad metaphors. Perfect
Read too deep
And it will be two weeks before you recuperate
From the music I make
I am a beautiful mistake
But even if you did see me coming
You didn’t know the shit me was coming with
Cause me so sick, like two week old Denny’s
And I say "me" because I deserve an Emmy
Or a Grammy

[Hook]
Fuckin’ seatbelt (Oh here we go)
Take me on another
Take me on another one of them
Trips…
(Oh here we go)
Pedal to the metal baby
Pedal to the metal baby
(Oh here we go)
1, 2 ya’ll
(Oh here we go)
Is this thing on?
(Oh here we go)
I’m bout to give to ya’ll
And I don’t stop… EVER

(Verse 2)
I’m a raging inferno of pink, with the face of a skull
Razor blades for my teeth. Got a tongue made of water
A voice made of pure vibration
I guess my songs are like word libations
So when this zone Out-patient
No diploma or diplomacy owning me
I go by my own lies, cause they truth to me
And I lie to you
Because it’s like nothing that you used to see
New beliefs. I never fall
Its my time to be on. And I’m better off
Than I ever was, cause I never lost
At least in my mind, cause I find better thoughts
Then worrying about even competing with the rest
I’m never in need of rest, cause death is my sleeping bed
If ever I leave my head. My body will ever detonate
So I am the bomb with a headache
Resonate

(Chorus)
Fuckin’ seatbelt (Oh here we go)
Take me on another
Take me on another one of them
Trips…
(Oh here we go)
Pedal to the metal baby
Pedal to the metal baby
(Oh here we go)
1, 2 ya’ll
(Oh here we go)
Is this thing on?
(Oh here we go)
I’m bout to give to ya’ll
And I don’t stop… EVER

(Verse 3)
And I awake in an incredible state
Even the location of the bed I awake
Or how much my head could take
Cause I’m forever awake
So rest in peace, nah
I’ma be dead on the stage still rockin
Still hopin, moshin'. Like I ain’t got sense
No care like I ain’t got bills
So if you don’t stare like I ain’t got skills
You gon' be broke sayin', “I ain’t got shit”
I don’t pop shit. I make people step in mine
You smell like I wasted a second time
And theoretically, you should feel cool about it
But you stink and there’s nothing you can do about it
What makes it worse is that Your aroma is shit
My shit
And my cologne is the shit
Some fly shit
Mind you, I don’t roll in a whip
I stay alone at home
Zoning and shit
Y’all want me to come out and play?

(Chorus)
Fuckin’ seatbelt (Oh here we go)
Take me on another (There you go)
Take me on another one of them
Trips…
(Oh here we go)
Pedal to the metal baby
Pedal to the metal baby (it’s Charles Hamilton)
(Oh here we go)
1, 2 ya’ll
(Oh here we go)
Is this thing on?
(Oh here we go)
I’m bout to give to ya’ll
And I don’t stop… EVER
