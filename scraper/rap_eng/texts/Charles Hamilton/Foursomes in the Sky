I was taught one. I offer some “How to be Awesome,” as a class. The chick that started Aftermath brought me to the sun. An awesome one. Awesome she is and awesome is the talk from the sun. And I’m the sun. You ain’t gotta try to rhyme with him at all, y’all. It’s like ball, y’all, when you’re tall, y’all. Some of y’all are off the yard. But y’all can watch me as I ball. Laugh at y’all who have a ball. I have a ball when I rap. Can’t say the same for y’all when you rap. Y’all cats is wack and I’m awesome. Keep talking crap because I’ma off them

I went downtown to find a bucket hat. Came back up with the crown. Can’t nobody really fuck with that. Every ghetto, every hood. Get down! One’s for the lover. Two’s for the blues. Three’s for the other. Four’s for the clue. One’s for the other. Two’s for the blues. Three’s for the other. Four’s for the clue

As soon as I find a groove I try to do the coolest thing. Which is
Provide for you the truest thing that I can move. Which is a mountain (I do it, quite cool). Can’t nobody do it like I do. I am the suicidal idol. As soon as I die it’s vital to know that my music could be a UFO. If beautiful aliens could ride along to my songs. My python inside of my suit. I’m six feet under. How about I do the impossible and reach up (!) and then grab my bride as a pre-nup. Come back to life and then we up. Don’t get mad at the sacrifice enough

Back on the mic, it’s a rapper’s delight. Snacking on rappers out of spite. These rappers can’t write, so I laugh at what they write. These niggas faggots on the mic. But I pat them on the back with a knife. Maybe they can have that and a glass, goodnight! Yeah, spinal fluid. The way I make music is quite lucid. You might trip to it but I get stupid when my shit gets fluid. As in, when it makes your asses bounce to it. Amount to this: millions of dollars and mountains of Cristal getting poured on a chick. More than enough to get a nigga bored in the whip with the baddest chick. Talking about the floor isn’t it
