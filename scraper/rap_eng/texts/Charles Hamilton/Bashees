The magic we make is breaking the sadness. Can we establish greatness between us without someone having to interrupting our lust? Must I trust you for you to continue? I must. I dug and dig. When I dug inside of your ditch, I simply felt that life was a bitch. And went harder and deeper. Then I lost energy. Then I lost enemies. Ya'll into me. Y'all intimately let me know  intermittently you're smitten with me. Give me a kiss - It's free. No distance from you to me. Move smoothly, move quickly, when you get on this thing. Baby, do me

Can you love me like before? Like before, when life was pure

Do you get me? Such a distant wish. Love the different kiss, like Apple. Make you laugh, but the grapple is not a wish. Is that not obvious? I simply want to touch and make love

After the snare comes the kick, rhythmically. After your vagina comes my dick. You come first, in one word: Us. And that's what's up. All I gotta do it touch you one more time. And let the track play just so you can wind
