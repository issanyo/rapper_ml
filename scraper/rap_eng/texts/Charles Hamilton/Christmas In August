I should make you suffer. Every last one of y’all blood suckers. The reason why I cuddle in the covers with the people that I find in the dust. Word. When I dig through the crates, I try to find a beautiful face to move away with, and then say the basics to. You can move away if the basics is what’s raping you.

Now, my bride is squirting next to me, because she knows that I am working fate in a perfect way. So let me see if I indeed am allowed to be as loud and free as freedom is when it’s loud.
