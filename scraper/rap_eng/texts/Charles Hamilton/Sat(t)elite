[Verse 1]
She's the color of the sun
The petals of a Daisy
I love the color yellow on my lady
I wanna be as perfect as she
Cause she's as perfect as perfect can be
And that's why I'm working to be
Her favorite dream, now she's nervous to sleep
Cause she knows she'll see me in a slumber
If love is blind, then I'm Stevie Wonder
She's a piano, I make music, with her
So I'll be damned if I abuse it
I would lose it, If I weren't in tune with, my lady
My piano does not need tuning
But I need improvement, cause she's talkin' bout' movin'
Rumors and all the shit, that she's assumin'
See I know I owe a lot to you
But all I can do is just promise you, that

[Hook]
You can leave if you want, but I ain't goin' no where
(I only wanna be with you)
Cause you know where your home is, so I don't care
(I only wanna be with you)
Just as long you know that I'm a stay right here
(I only wanna be with you)
So you can leave if you want, but you ain't goin' no where
You are my Satellite

[Verse 2]
All the tears of pain and joy
All the silly times just makin' noise
To all the many times you were straight annoyed
The shit I'd be talkin', we can't avoid
Smiling when we think of eachother
I know I can't dance, so I can't go to parties
For us to dance slow
But I can go write you a song that can paint out my love
Music of Van Gogh
I can't hold a candle to your love
But it's your love that I want more of
I lost your trust and your heart torn up
Cause I'm being selfish with a sophomore crush
I was just a baby now I'm all grown up
I found solid ground, now my heart won't budge
Even when I don't know what the hell to do
All I know is tell the truth
Don't wanna lose you, cause

[Hook]

[Bridge] x4
She's all mine and I still, can't believe it
Things aren't fine, but I will, make it even

(I Love you) x8
