[Intro]
A lot of niggas gotta say something about the way I dress and my favorite color
I got a little message for these little bum ass niggas

[Verse 1]
But listen homie, I dress fly, yes I'm sharp as a tack
And unless I'm dead tired, I'll always a match
Charles is that cat, and y'all can in fact
Can never say my closet is whack, and I don't need Jordan's for that
I got my white classics, pink laces, socks to match
And my watch and my boxers match, are you watching that?
I'm too clean, so these haters wanna flex
Cause the polo's pink and white, alligator on my left
Listen, usually I talk with modesty
But, ain't another nigga hot as me
I'm, on a roll and ain't no stopping me
I take my wifey on a shopping spree
So she can get fly and cop them things
I'm copping lots of rocks, she got to bling
I'm stacking paper man, it's not a game
So all you bitches, stop gossiping

[Hook x2]
I'm fresh to death
Young, fly, and flashy baby
I'm moving quick, so come try and catch me baby
I get cash baby, and make tracks baby
And my favorite color's P-I-N-K

[Verse 2]
Love it when you fuckers are fronting in public
Because of the color the assumption is dumbshit
It's nothing my brother if you come with that tough shit
I call the team over, then the beat's over
I guess cause I rock clothes the color pink
You give haters the thought that they're supposed to fuck with me
Mad cause their hoes is loving me
And I got the best flow, now I got to expose them publicly
Yeah I know that you be popping shit
But when you see me, it's the opposite
And, you be lying like you be popping clips
When we know you wouldn't pop a zit
Don't be mad because I got your chick
She hit me off, and then she topped the flick
Therefore, I advise you not to kiss
Cause her mouth is holding lots of kids

[Hook x2]
I'm fresh to death
Young, fly, and flashy baby
I'm moving quick, so come try and catch me baby
I get cash baby, and make tracks baby
And my favorite color's P-I-N-K

[Verse 3]
I'm conceited, believe it, don't need a reason to be it
I'm a genius, no need to be greeted to see it
My ideas are yours, but I say it, you think it
Then I love being different, so every day I'm going to pink it
And no y'all, I am not trying to be killa Cam
I'm different man, I don't so it for attention, damn
If you don't get it, just listen to what I'm spitting, man
Eminem, Common, N.E.R.D., Incubus, and Jigga ,man
I refuse to ever be told no
Not concerned wherever deetos(?) knows
I just want to let the people know
That the kids talented and he gon' blow
And music got me thinking selfishly
Because being humble wasn't helping me
Instead of crying out helplessly
I went to boosting my self-esteem

[Hook x2]
I'm fresh to death
Young, fly, and flashy baby
I'm moving quick, so come try and catch me baby
I get cash baby, and make tracks baby
And my favorite color's P-I-N-K

[Outro]
What's that tiff, stop stunting on these niggas
Where's the fun in that. I'm out, one
