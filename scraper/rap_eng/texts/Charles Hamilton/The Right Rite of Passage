This ain't the Long Island Rail Road. If you want to go the hell home, hell no! Let's go! You gotta pay the price if you're trying to be nice and precise. But I choose to ride with slices, like bread. "Off the head," I said. Like Sam-I-Am I can if I'm Dan and I can it if I'm not. Shutting the hell up as if up was home. What to know? Struggling so much there's no love to go. It's like Chinese take-out. I go the safe route. Date now a chick who's an '8' and loud. Figure my nigga. But it figures, my nigga. She beggar. She looking for me while I pull the lever. I'm making these suggestions while I'm making these questions. Am I safe in my essence? Blessings

Where does this go?
Who is this poem to?
You know what I'm going through
And that's for sho' on you
Where does this go to?
You know what I go through
I'm feeling like Goku
But maybe that's not so cool

Ayo, I'm fucking stubborn. But I love it. As if it's nothing. Pick it up if you dug it. Ayo, I'm stubborn. Word to my mother who used to govern my moves in the upper echelon. But when am I wrong? When I am, my man, my Mama's hand would scold me, hold me, god damn. So cold to me. It's as if Antarctica was her ovaries. She told me don't believe, then she tells me to
And we're supposed to be wealthy. Who's clue? I don't want you to survive off of me, I want you to thrive off of me. Mama, talk to me. While I fall asleep I call a beast like "watch over me." I'm ovaries, so I freeze. My mama taught me not to stay where they lay cocky. And I was cocky in my room. But the wrong winner and it would be doom, I assume. Uncool, ungroomed, funky as the groove, and I am jumping to a new conclusion. I have made another beast who watch me. And I say into the streets "Come watch he!" Pay attention as the beast of cockiness and conceit watches me with the beat. Obviously to be one of the top three. Of which I can say I watched, indeed
