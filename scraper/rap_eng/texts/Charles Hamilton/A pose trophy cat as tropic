[Verse]
I’m callin’ you a bitch, ‘cause I miss you too much
A kiss from you, and distance isn’t too much
Soon as I woke up, I grew up
Threw up. Blew up
Told my dude to roll up, and my weed spoke up
… The same time I threw up

I woke up still asleep
Vomit stuck in my sheets
Eyes shut from the vomit
Writing on the lining behind my eyelids
Someone PLEASE turn down the silence?
Right about now? I think there’s something I hid
So I dream of being inside you
Reason why I ask when I need to be beside you
… Beside myself
Getting high, denying help of a psychiatrist
Hiding my belt, and looking inside of my cell
Looking at ME, inside of a cell
My options seem to file themselves
Stay faithful
Play bachelor
Wait tables. Be a great rapper
Say uncle. To detractors
Factor the junk they say, pack it away in a trunk, and go away;
[And] Come back when the sun’s passion, runs after someone’s AFTER

Life after a period is a website disaster
In context, what I write incites laughter
Except, I have ACCEPTED my plight, and spend my nights… as a self-pastor
Will we reunite?
Like Jesus Christ; Don’t read my life
To make sure I reach inside, think of you every five minutes
Minute three I cry
Minute four; I grin, from being sure she’s alive
Reaching five, I SI-

Drink some hot chocolate
And cut back a few of my f*ckin’ options…

My self-esteem must rise for the benefit of nurses, who just lie to my limbs for a little bit
MUST I…

… Begins my mental sentences
And, dyslexia…
Is the remnants of a question messed up
OBLIGATORY. The sickest story
But save all your kisses for me
I miss you, and I will be with you shortly
