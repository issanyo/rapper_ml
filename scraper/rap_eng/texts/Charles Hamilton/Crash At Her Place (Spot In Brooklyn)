[Hook]
Tonight, Tonight
I won't be all up in your face
Tonight, Tonight
I just really miss your blanket with you under it
I just really miss your blanket with you under it

[Verse 1]
Her blackberry times, around the quarter to nine
I'm up earlier, I thought it was time
She turns on Maury and she laughs Her Story was bad, my shorty bad
What a war we have
She loves me She loves me lovin her I love her, I love her not, but I'm in love with her
Huggin her under the comforter tryin to comfort her I might be too immature to be under her
Smothering her cause I'm in love with her Dissin her cause I'm sick of her next to her Cause I never heard something said in jest that wasn't love
Accept the love I let you bug out, I love your mouth
Rosie perez meets the Jamaican in precious makin your presents felt by pressure and forever the budge you never give up but ur seldom in love but I sell dumb to the bugged
And provide wisdom to listening eyes This time be the wish I find glistened

[Hook]
Can we crash at your place
Tonight, Tonight
I won't be all up in your face
Tonight, Tonight
I just really miss your blanket with you under it
I just really miss your blanket with you under it

[Verse 2]
You're so loud and eratic when goin out with your rabid friends
That grab sound barriers and shatter them Intense patterns of sitting back
And kissing the cat captures your inner rabbit
But doesn't happen to matter when youre mad at me
For childish shit
This is how wild it gets
Mild it begins and call of the wild As we pretend that for a awhile being friends is how the convo end
Shorty I love you
Too much for an easy decision
Believe I'm getting twisted
When thinking of this being it
Please forgive and open the door when I knock
And I hate condoms, don't put my soldier in a knot
?? As if you don't know what I been jottin As history shows, it's not like you don't know what I been dropping
But Just watch me knock your socks off with a dust of wind
Just friends we are, pretty hard Now remove your pretty bra let's fall asleep please

[Hook]
Can't crash at your place
Tonight, Tonight
I won't be lovin your face
Tonight, Tonight
I just really miss your blanket with you under it
I just really miss your blanket with you under it


You don't have to still be mine for me to hold you
There is no way you can deny that I still love you
But waiting I be and I want to know-o..

[Hook]
Can't crash at your place
Tonight, Tonight
I won't be lovin your face
Tonight, Tonight
I just really miss your blanket with you under it
I just really miss your blanket with you under it(x2)
