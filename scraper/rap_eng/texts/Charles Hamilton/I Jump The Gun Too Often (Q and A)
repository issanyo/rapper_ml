I've been real quiet lately
I just wanna be honest with everybody
About a few things, couple of emotions
Know we can get it going, check one two

[Verse 1]
The resurrection of a martyr
Respect that I'm smarter
Resting was hard, being a peasant was harder
The peasant made the beat, the balls pardoned the barter
No excuses I’ve been beckoned to rep Harlem
F to the R to the ESH’in when I’m steppin
I wreck what you reckon when I step on it like “Pardon”
Took a vacation I didn’t want to take
Keep it a hundred I wanted to plummet, come and play
From the runway to what some say is the biggest mistake that I’ll regret one day
Yep, dumb way to say domestic violence is wrong
But no rubbing my jaw while I’m writing this song
Sing along, try to be the new Bob Dylan breaking through 2Pac’s ceiling
I do not kill but if you knew my feelings, you would stop grilling “My dude I’m chilling”

[Hook]
Curiosity killed the cat
We in the afterlife how real is that?
They said I can’t blog but I still could rap
So Imma make y’all feel this track
You got questions, I got answers
You got questions ( Yo), I got answers

[Verse 2]
I disrespected management, sick of the disrespecting Hamilton, I had a vision, yes with plans for them
Took the rights of passage before I had to
I won’t do it again so who asked you?
Bad move, then I pissed off House Shoes, niggas ain't like me before but they will now shoot
If I’m in their town (ooh)
When it comes to pissing mad people off, I wrote the how to
Instead of telling him to die with a dick in his eye I apologized tell him “Hi” and kiss him goodnight
As for Black Spade he must have had a bad day
So what I stole his beat? Fuck it, the tracks great
After that bar, mad hate
The album was free, use it as an ashtray
No more Rihanna talk, it was a past phase
She can have Ye right now I’m on the cash chase

[Hook]
Curiosity killed the cat
We in the afterlife how real is that? (Standing right here with the firing squad)
They said I can’t blog but I still could rap
So Imma make y’all feel this track (Eyes blindfolded, hands tied behind my back. Shoot.)
You got questions (At least I’m being real) , I got answers( Charles Hamilton)
You got questions, I got answers
