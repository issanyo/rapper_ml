So many days and times and instances where I can say a rhyme and pimp the shit, saying “I get it in!” Maybe it’s fine in the mind of people who are listening. But the evil that glistens within those that I could try harder. My mind has gotten smarter. I am not a martyr but I died for the cause of lives to start. Like babies may need to exist for me to exit and drift within. I’m so young when I think about my old tongue. No one can grow without one, and I’m one. And that’s just how it goes until I’m done. And when I’m done, nothing else will continue on. So please listen to this song while I’m getting it on

We are on a journey from birth to
We are on a journey earth to space
We are on a journey from hurt, to praise, to hate
We are on a journey to show you our race
We are on a journey today

Space may be in question because people rape me in this mess of destiny. It’s hard to accept me because all of them are inside of me and incepting me. Now they learn the lessons I speak, and they give it. Wait a minute, that’s my shit! Maybe it will take a fist to the face? Or maybe I just need to be living today? Get away with some shit, it’s not a great sign. I see them great dimes but, may it exist? I don’t really know what to say about this shit. I'm just spitting because today I can spit. Wait a minute, ain’t that some shit? The fact I spit? After this, no cats should spit. I done been through it all. Fist and dick against the wall. I spit bars

We are on a journey from birth to We are on a journey earth to space
We are on a journey from hurt, to praise, to hate
We are on a journey to show you our race
We are on a journey today

Yo Steve, I thought I lost everything! It’s heavy to be me. So he’s a heavyweight x2 because he’s heavier than me. Maybe deadlier than me. You saved me from me. You saved me from Jay-Z. Make me believe. I said SEGA and I proved it! Maybe not just with the music but them Maybelline chicks. May I be a six and rain on these kids? These little niggas act like I don’t be saying shit when I speak. It’s different when I speak! The shit that I speak is the shit that I see. Really now, it’s the M-I-C. It can hold my voice. I don’t want to make no more choices

We are on a journey from birth to We are on a journey earth to space
We are on a journey from hurt to praise to hate
We are on a journey to show you our race
We are on a journey today
