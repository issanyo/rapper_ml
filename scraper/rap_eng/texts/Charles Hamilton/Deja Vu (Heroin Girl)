[Verse 1]
I hate when girls look too familiar
Cause then I get an unusual feeling
And when I say have we met before It's not because seeing you is a beautiful feeling
I used to binge with friends I shouldn't have had
Most are dead or imaginary, just In the past
But one lady young lady dumb lady
One crazy lover made me 180
We met at a rave party in soho
Great party though I hate parties, I won't go now
Cause a flash backs to back then
So, Let me tell you what happened
L gave me a few tabs of some other shit
I was cooked already, for the fuck of it
No peer pressure, suddenly she grabbed me, kissed me
Before I spoke, she said let's make tonight history
Before tonight is history
My high ass smiled and said I like what this could be, you got a spoon?
She said, do you got a syringe?
And that's how the drama begins...damn

[Hook]
Intoxicating is your smile
But please don't be my heroin girl
You got me standing for a while
But please don't be my heroin girl, my heroin girl

[Verse 2]
I only pop twice, both times with she
I had her wrote rhymes with me
I mean write, don't mind me please
High from memories, driving me to sleep
I dive between the sheets in my Homies mothers bed, where all the raves were
My lonely lover said, one day we gonna not be twisted
We still love each other, we can not be this sick
Deja Vu can't copy this shit
You're Not in your body Charles watch me kiss it
She went down, I went up
Then touch gods fist, what is up
I came down to see that she was down for me
Being down at least, for the sound of me I sang her this ever clear song
It was ever so clear I couldn't ever be more wrong
And I'll forever be a moron
Cause I never even asked her name
We drifted apart, don't know if she passed away
But I remember she would listen to what I had to say
With that I say thanks, my heroin girl

[Hook]
Intoxicating is her smile
But please don't be my heroin girl
You got me standin For a while
But please don't be my heroin girl, my heroin girl


Are you just a memory
Or a twisted lie
And would you remember me
If I caught your eye
So please, say that you're real
And not in my mind, all this time

[Hook]
Intoxicating is her smile
But please don't be my heroin girl
You got me standin For a while
But please don't be my heroin girl, my heroin girl
