Yo I'm dead ass
It's kinda funny how, it's kinda funny how being around the right chicks
Can step ya bars up
Especially depending on the season

C H A R

[Verse 1:]
Got my name back from niggas
Got my dick back from bitches
Just sit back and listen to the impact I'm giving
Is it that I'm living that different has a decision to make
I'm living great but hey a decision is fate
Picture a date encrypted into the way you listen
And maintain a trip of the ways
Flipping the way bliss gives way to disgrace
Depending on the way you delivering what you say
Don't pretend to be amazed
It must be a feast of disgusting
Keeping percussion deep in
The oven in which I speak to beats in
Reaping what I sow
Seeing what is the soul
To freeing my upper knuckles when heating up in the cold
Need I remind me I be holding you hand
Ran over a van stand to stand shoulder to shoulder with Stan
A fan who didn't plan to meet the man
But is instead a fan of reason and people living in basements
C'MON

[Hook:]
We up in this minivan
Bout to take a trip to the other side
Bout to take a Trip to the other side
Bout to take a trip to the other side(C H A R)
We bout to walk oor rUnorrrrrr
Just flip to the other side
Just do a kick flip to the other side
Just do a kick flip to the other side

[Verse 2:]
My amazing lady friend, I say again
Can we spend the day in tent just playing hey don't pay the rent
Jaded to the way you complain and say we should end
Fate again hate even can break even in the AM so babe
May we be safe in our rock habits
I got magic back flip the stop gravity in decisions
I'm not mad at me I'm simply listening, different
And hot rapping easily comes with kissing the watch
Is it that or me fascinate even half of what she
Radically calls her lack of need
I sit back and plead what actually did pass
The mental grief, an instrumental, heat, and spazzin'- Dot
Every sentence I don't say is home plate
No play, No lastin' in the sheets
Master what we read and practice what I preach
And I'm only adding butt cause that makes up my checks
What

[Hook:]
We up in this minivan
Bout to take a trip to the other side
Bout to take a Trip to the other side
Bout to take a trip to the other side
We bout to walk oor rUnorrrrrr
Just flip to the other side
Just do a kick flip to the other side
Just do a kick flip to the other side

[Verse 3:]
You can't be prissy cause we plan to get busy
I am in the city
And damn if a visit to a different planet wouldn't be pretty
Hamilton answered and pushed the limits of change
Until the limit isn't as strange as intuition is
En-tertainment
Can perhaps be where the backseat can take us
So, Hey love with ya make up blush
Or race cut to make up a way to say RUSH!
Day to day we fuss and take away the 'wasn't us'
Until they say to us make up a way to say that we suck
Pay up, faded painters are like playing with a knife
Day to day night the later craters safe in the day light
Waves to the right and my lady by my side makes me the guy
We bout to get crazy tonight
August Rush

[Outro:]
See-
Heh, thought I was gon spell my name?

August Rush
It's the
It's the Tony Hawk of Talk C'mon

Listen to the CHops my nigga

Just do a kick flip to the other side
