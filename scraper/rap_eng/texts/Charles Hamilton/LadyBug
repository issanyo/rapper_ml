[Hook 1: Yung Nate]
You can be my lady bug
Just don't tell my lady 'cause you know my lady bug
I don't know
Maybe it's the G or she high off E
Naw miss, I think you high off me

[Hook 2: Charles]
You can be my lady bug
Just don't tell my lady 'cause you know my lady bug, see..
I don't wanna let you go
But I gotta let you know
We gotta keep it on the low
Keep, keep it on the low

[Verse 1: Yung Nate]
She's my freaky freaky dumb thing
Apple bottom with a cherry apple tongue ring
I go to see her every monday
(??????) Her dumb cake, get dumb brains
D-d-d-d-dumb brains
How she fell in love with me
I don't know
Gotta keep shorty away from me
Keep sayin' my G-O-V
Keep mommy up in my reach
The golden rubber keep the snuggie
Fall in love, I fall in lust
I gotta wifey, fuck ya trust
As I swerve and slide up inside you
You realize your worth resides between ya thighs
Me? I'm gon' stay fly and you gon' stay used
Goddamn I'm so cool new jewels and suade shoes
She love that nate move, my moves don't love you
She wanted the spotlight, now left the hindsight
Look if you wanna be my lady on a rope
You gotta keep it on the low, keep, keep it on the low
Hey

[Hook 1: Yung Nate]
You can be my lady bug
Just don't tell my lady 'cause you know my lady bug
I don't know
Maybe it's the G or she high off E
Naw miss, I think you high off me

[Hook 2: Charles Hamilton]
You can be my lady bug
Just don't tell my lady 'cause you know my lady bug, see..
I don't wanna let you go
But I gotta let you know
We gotta keep it on the low
Keep, keep it on the low

[Verse 2: Charles Hamilton]
I got this Puerto Rican thing
Wanna keep it secret so I ain't gon' speak her name
But shorty stay fly gotta mean sneaker game
Shit, I'm a G.E.D. alumni give me some brain
She's a dame so keep away
She like to play games
Say things, go on myspace and make up these stupid ass display names
I told her just because my wife is light skin she be blackin'
So why you tryna fight with lightnin'
But she don't give a fuck she just tryna get a nut
So every time I hit her up she know she gotta give it up
If I get her alone and it's on I can get her wet
On the internet or just draws on the floor
She get one whiff of my cologne and she gone
Shagged in the lab and boned in my home
But I'm stuck like cheese in my heart
So like smoking weed in a park you gotta roll on the low
