It's that soul you've been missing. Let's see if I can do it justice

I asked her does she love me or Come Des Gar√ßons. I hold the future, I know what's in my palm. So what's going on? Miss, this ain't your prom but I keep a distance because what's on is so soulful and needs my full attention. So do you. I'm so close to you. The vocal booth knows it's true, it's making room for you and I. No longer room for suicide. Every time I hit a blunt I got to get a month to recover. Like Deep Cover, 187 on an undercover cop and the undercover now is Marvin Gaye, I can't stop. He's arresting me with his soul, so with different strokes I give you folks an intimate listen into the kid's vision. Gotta keep it different

I hustle my pain, I'm in love with the game, so give me the ball
I struggle the same, my struggle's insane, so give me the ball
Oh baby, I hope you remember me. If I'm distant, then it's meant to be

Instead of living inside your pain, write your pain down and try to get inside the game. They like it when you're true and humble. With music I'm humble but I make the street crumble every time I let a beat like this rock. Never saying "Eat my dick, Hip Hop!" But I got some chicks inside the industry that wish to be giving me the kind of love that's a symphony. I consider symphonies love. Thank for giving me love. I'm lifted above, higher then the clouds when they're dousing you. I'm Dhalsim when I'm the booth. My yoga until I'm over is spitting flames, letting you know what it is. So I'm legit, hold my shit (the whole track). Or hold my hand and never hold back. Let's go

I hustle my pain, I'm in love with the game, so give me the ball

Destiny is scratching my back. That's the recipe as a matter of fact. I recline and lay down on times and days where I would stay down in all kinds of ways to stay inside of the straight-minded, and those who have fallen astray. I blind them and put them on the right path again. They say it's an accident to be Black but then the strongest race is holding itself up. That's so much for self-help and love. I'm feeling like a puppy in the fucking sea as a guppy, sharks surrounding me. They love me, but only because they want to eat. The sharks are the game and they're in front of me. I not wanna-be, I'll get devoured if it means we'll be living louder. I'm a martyr

This song is dedicated to every female I fell is too busy. And to every male that wishes they were with me. I'm making history
