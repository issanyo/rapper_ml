[Verse 1: Yung Nate]
Ever since day one I ain’t change son
You see my face and say “Nate young”
Hence the name son Yung Nate stay real, Monday to Sunday
I G-Mack a Wednesday though, that’s my hub day
Loose quarter got the yellow water Cooking in the kitchen with the coffee pot
Dice game, bank stop
Eyy I don’t really care for the bid
Cause we got much more than you see I do me
Obligated to make bigger figures
I’m not a house nigga, I'm shooting niggas
My mama told a nigga to stop saying nigga so from the point on I won’t, nigga
The T.V. watch me baby
God damn my swag is crazy
Elevated haters make em swallow their foot cause I'm so much hotter than them
You fucking bitch

[Hook: Yung Nate & Charles Hamilton]
I went from pitching rocks
Getting stabbed up and banging shots
And now I got the game on lock
(Much more than they can see)
I went from rocking pink
To this day still rocking pink, so put it together
(And what we have is much more than they can see)

[Verse 2: Yung Nate]
You see that man talking?
He a dead man walking I don’t care if he a dead man hawk him
Niggas try to take my life, so best believe fam I'm making sure that you die
God damn I'm fly, bitch
I’m so motherfucking high gotta put my head down just to look at the sky doggy
My swag(my swag) my ice, just pick it up and buy it don’t look at the price
Outkast of the game I threw diamonds in the frame I'm young Hova to a ROC hold the block down
We used to eat off a quarter key
But day forty eight got me re-ing up my grams by the G, uh
Narrow-minded niggas can’t sleep but I don’t work for money, money work for me, yeah
Charles MC, Yung Nate, all y’all niggas suck my dick no homo y’all don’t fuck with me B

[Verse 3: Charles Hamilton]
I say guess who ba-zack?
The polo, the blazer, the pink pack pi-zack
Carlton Banks of ri-zap
The difference is I got the swagger of Will
And my money Phil-up banks yeah my Jazz is for real
You faggots are Hill asking for Bills keep at it
An accident Will happen for real Nate packing a still
I’m back packing with mad tracks and Katt Stacks smacking her grill enough to make cats wanna chill
I need you? Don’t flatter yourself
I never asked you for help I established myself so
Don’t think you getting half of my wealth
Cause you loving my tracks, keep that crap to yourself
I rap for my health, truth be told so I ain’t really got time for no groupie hoes
Shit how else could I say this I’m Rick James bitch and you Tina Marie cause you Rick James Bitch
We break the mold dog
Break them hoes off like take your clothes off get naked, no problem, it’s a sacred old song, what’s taking so long, nothing
We know yall can’t shake the prolong , so wait for no longer its finally here
Hear the Hip Hop version of Caine and O-Dog
A menace to society, these niggas that be trying me
Go ahead, watch your face get blown off
So if you don’t want no trouble just get out cause Yung Nate and Charles in the motherfucking house
Ain’t no way that you can fold me dummy
Couldn’t fold my name with a roll of twenties, its been that way since I started rapping nigga I'm a loose cannon and it’s time to play target practice
Niggas saying they gonna knock me down but I can’t hear shit like Foxy Brown, clown

[Hook: Yung Nate & Charles Hamilton]
I went from pitching rocks
Getting stabbed up and banging shots
And now I got the game on lock
(Much more than they can see)
I went from rocking pink
To this day still rocking pink, so put it together
(And what we have is much more than they can see)
