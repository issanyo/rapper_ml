[Charles Hamilton-Verse 1]
When you get used to lookin' down
Looking up only means you gotta look around
I see the hood around
People don't believe in seeing any good around
Cause they live in the sky, used to lookin' down
Dead bodies, new-born souls
Fire in their heart, add a few more coals
Perhaps the glory of copping a two-door Rolls
Is the reason why some would do a few more shows
And then there is me, using music as my therapy
So I hope you niggas hearin' me
Stare at me, glare at me
Apparently your scared of me
Because the air I breathe
Is everywhere that you ain't prepared to be
I'm never scared of the images that you ain't care to see
Cause if you look, then you'll see what appears to be
Me. Yep, it's me, I'm certain
At least to my dreams I'm more than a person

[Hook]
I heard a voice say
(You're the one)
I asked who it is and it faded away
(Away)
That's how I know that im able to say
Damn, this beat is...
(So dumb right now)
Maybe it's because I had to fend for myself
Build my own wall of defence for myself
But I just want a love that was meant for myself

[Charles Hamilton-Verse 2]
The only reason why I'm second guessing
Is cause I found myself smarter with the second question
So I'm never stressin'
Cause you can replace Smarter
With any positive adjective you can consider harder
First I said fuck stardom, I'ma be a problem
But all of the over thoughts is why I am a starter
The money doesn't do it
But damn if it isn't the grandest incentive on the planet banished in riches
But the damn difference is, every damn sentence is
Me putting my hands in a fist, standing in bliss
Cause I knocked out the killer of my damn innocence
I air it out like a fan in a vent
Ain't nobody stopping me from standing again
I'm a falling baby when I land on a pin
A Jim Carey, "Cable Guy", stand with a grin
Obsessed with what I'm blessed with
But will help in a second

[Hook]

[Charles Hamilton-Verse 3)
When I step on the blocks I used to run through
I come to, life is a dream come true
Went from 2-1-2 to 3-1-2
Females that hated sayin, "Can we come, too?"
You know me, I don't care if they be untrue
You don't get this lonely. Huh, do, you?
It's aight though. With the right dough
And the shine that the spot light show
I might go, into the next phase is psycho. Peaceful
Life of an eagle and flight with the segal
Sky so clear, the night lookin' see-through
Fight through the deep rooted plight that's beneath you
You got the mother fuckin' right to, believe you can say
What you want, on the mic, cause you need too
Reason why? You only write what you see, true?
Look in my eyes, It was nice to meet you

[Hook]
