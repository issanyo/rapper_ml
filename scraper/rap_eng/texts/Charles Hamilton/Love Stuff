[Intro]
Mic check 1,2,3, let me forecast
Make it rain on 'em, Charles Hamilton

[Verse 1]
Love is like a cloud
That needs to show the world how it feels to be doused
The feeling of telling your girl we out
Out to the steakhouse where we could make out
Take out what we order, maybe some orderves
Find some more nerves to get on, more skin to get under
Spit one word, I spit thunder
While you sit under my rain
I guess this is all from the brain
But at the same time, I maintain the same frame of maintaining
Just wanna talk about love

[Hook]
I just wanna talk about love
I just wanna talk about love
I just wanna talk about love
I just wanna talk about love
I just wanna talk about love

[Verse 2]
There is no kind of editing sound
To let a nigga down
So let a nigga know if you gon roll
Don't upset a nigga now
Cept another nigga might get a nigga pounded out in my town
My crown is untarnished, darn it
I got hard shit that I want to deliver
Sort of like UPS with stones for your liver
Or your gall bladder, does it all matter
If you love yourself, you could avoid all the chatter
So maybe I'm my own worst enemy
That's why these haters be offending me
There's no kin you see
In this damn industry
Except the one kin to we, which'd be the MC to the L-y-T-E
No lie but I gotta keep a tight end
Have the haters frightened
My end will never be seen
Forever be C, you can't ever be see
Cause I just want to talk about what I'm in
Love

[Hook]
I just wanna talk about love
I just wanna talk about love
I just wanna talk about love
I just wanna talk about love
I just wanna talk about love
I just wanna talk about love
I just wanna talk about love
I just wanna talk about love
I just wanna talk about love
