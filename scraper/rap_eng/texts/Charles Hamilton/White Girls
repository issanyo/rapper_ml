Hey chick, is your name Molly? Because I know Miley and she got me, probably. But I'm wilding, saying a Molly is SEGA. My god, I'm a player. Only because I got Bayonetta, trying to not let up. And I'm Sonic. I'm ugly, to be honest, but y'all watching. Why you give a fuck if I'm naked? Is it because I'm rocking great kicks and my socks are white? Like Chi-Town
Lie down then I'm not right. I lie down and I get pipe by them niggas with knives in their windpipe. Fuck them, white chicks will dig it. Because black chicks think I'm pussy. Hold it a minute

Talk to me, girl. Talk to me, girl. Because it appears to me that you like the way I groove. So go ahead and girl just do that arm-pointing thing you do

Ayo, Junior's a sequel. Just assume that it's evil. And I'm grooming the people to either get in line like a Soul Train, or give me their mind when they go bang. I'm arrogant. Looking at the pentagram, there again. I've said it before. I'll say it again. I'm playing to win. Stare at this. The heroine interrogant. I dare you, staring in. I bounce back, nigga. This is my track, nigga. Thank you P, thank you Justin. But I'm back, nigga. And I bust spines on them bad hoes that say they love mine. I don't mean to laugh but, yo, what time is it? Am I such a fine midget?

Talk to me, girl. Talk to me, girl. Because it appears to me that you like the way I groove. So go ahead and girl just do that arm-pointing thing you do
