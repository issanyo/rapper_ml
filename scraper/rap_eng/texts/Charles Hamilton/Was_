Tell your bitch my ad-libs are the reason why we need to get it cracking. Yo, my fault. By accident. All I got to do is walk behind and pat it. Yeah, her ass got a barcode, and her pussy got patented. And that's just my rapping shit. I don't want to have to take her "Back to the - back to the crib!" I got beef with Chris because he ain't seeing this shit. And the nigga swear can so I'ma stare him down like I did in LA. D-I-L-L-A, let me know if I'm crossing a line I'm a boss in his time. Period. PERIOD. Niggas ain't HEARING it, hearing it. All they do is act like they mirroring me. Niggas got froze and they tried to twist it. Trying to be with my D-I ballistics. Fuck it, I'm demented, when it comes to my Dilla, nigga, I just rip shit. Literally, ripped your flesh. Disrespect you, disrespect your chick if she's next. And if she believed that pretext that I just read. Fuck it. It's all in my head, right? Is it not? Spacely Sprockets, let me know if this rocks. And my hook is the reason I need to get knots

I was, a millionaire
I was, considered the next best thing
I was, the next big thing
I was, the next kid spinning
I was, considered the greatest
And then I met Dilla!
And then I met Dilla!
And then I met Dilla!
And then I met Dilla!
And then I met Dilla!
