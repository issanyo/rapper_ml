[Intro]

I like happy things, cause it's like a dyslexic smile
Charles Hamilton

[Verse 1]

I over-think, I think I said too much
I stayed in bed too much, this sucks
I over-drink, I shouldn't feel this sick
There's a razor on my wrist, but I don't feel this shit

[Bridge]

Oh, oh, oh, oh
I'll pretend to smile for a while
Don't judge me, you don't know me
You don't love me, you don't own me

[Hook]

This is what I know, I'm all alone
Everywhere I go I call it home
You can't help me, no, don't call my phone
And if you feel like this you know you're all alone
All alone

[Verse 2]

I look to Heaven for divine intervention
And God says, "Charles, stop whining and bitching,"
Now, I'm in a position to live a little better
If this isn't heaven, then I'm pissed forever
I need to get it together

[Bridge]

Oh, oh, oh, oh
I'll pretend to smile for a while
Don't judge me, you don't know me
You don't love me, you don't own me

[Hook]

This is what I know, I'm all alone [Caught a limo (?) blinking in my bedroom]
Everywhere I go I call it home [Is there space on your couch?]
You can't help me, no, don't call my phone [I left my Blackberry in Atlanta]
And if you feel like this you know you're all alone [One time for me]

[Bridge 2]

Somebody, somebody help me out
Somebody, somebody help me out
Somebody, somebody help me out
Somebody, somebody help me out

[Verse 3]

Everybody wanna know where I'm at
Locked in my room like a spoiled brat
Jumping on the bed like a spoiled brat
Cause I can't have my way

[Hook]

This is what I know, I'm all alone
Everywhere I go I call it home [I'm not crazy]
You can't help me, no, don't call my phone
And if you feel like this you know you're all alone
All alone

This is what I know, I'm all alone
Everywhere I go I call it home
You can't help me, no, don't call my phone
And if you feel like this you know you're all alone

[Somebody, somebody help me out]
