They say reality bites, huh?
You know my name

Feel the seduction of the night. Be a victim of what you want to fight. Keep living through lust as if it's right, but blood is your kryptonite. The rush is in the bite. It sucks because this isn't right. But your justice fucks with you it's plight. No one understands, it's your choice to run. Sleep all day to avoid the sun. Come out just to party in a cave, be it an industry party or a party called a rave. Let your eyes get starry from the haze. You hardly want to stay you want to party up in space. Maybe there you could escape the mean mugs and face the scream to get a taste of sweet blood. I'm a daywalker but I don't bite, because if I taste blood I'm something you won't like

Take you a trip to dark side

You're forsaken, forgiven from all lies
At all times, for all crimes

My hunger, far from a wonder. Bloody Mary's at the bar getting numbers. I keep wanting to spazz from the stress, getting mad at the press, hit my casket for rest (in peace). Wake up in the AM, Google my name, read the statements people making. "This guy sucks," if homie only knew. He's a future victim, that's what i'm going through. You know it's true, I hide in the shadows, like a judge I get high from the gallows. Not guilty, he who is not feel me is not real to me therefore it doesn't appeal to me, but will still make a meal to me. So tell me what the fuck is a deal to me? Now I get all the blood that I need
Hence why I signed to Jimmy Iovine

Got legions of people fiending to see me leave each beat I speak to bleeding. I speak to these deep freaks who need a needle to believe in the change that I'm leading. I eat weak MCs for being reason for me seething and make my teeth uneven. The nameless gamers aiming their brainless brains may just make me stay away for days. Take a razor blade and feed off myself. Stay away from my babe and beat off myself. Walk around bleeding, secreting semen, so I can speak to the demon within. (KEEP READING) into me, poor competition, stop wishing I would stop living. I'm not living, neither are you. We're in eternity. Don't try to murder me, you might need surgery to remove my claws from your neck. Blood loss or a loss of respect, you're choice. Just remember, my fingers dictate your voice
