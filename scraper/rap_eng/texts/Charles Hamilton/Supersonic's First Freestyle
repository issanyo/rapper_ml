[Verse 1]
Sometimes I wanna be alone but I can't be
I just wanna zone from the land we
Call Earth, some call it sanity
Either way I wanna run call it vanity
The mirror says, "Yeah, I know who you are
You supposed to be Charles
Getting close to the Stars"
But this peroxide is just molding my scars
Not healing, I'm numb
Not feeling, the drums
Stop peeling the Sun-Burn
Your Un-Der
Your own Hypnosis
Closed fist
I beat on myself, I won't shit
I pee on myself, I'm so pissed
Oh, shit
Get stalked by some old bitch
That knew me
Never blew me
Sees the new me
Now running around saying we old friends
So when
I talk about skeeting in this bitches face, Know then
If I'm being Heartbroken
And I committed no sin

[Hook]
I know how you feel about me
Well I guess I feel the same
All you ever did was doubt me
The only true thing is my name
My Name (Charles Hamilton)

[Verse 2]
Dead ass Jimmy, I dont need it man, take the deal
At least homeless I knew that I was safe for real
Mothafuckas wanna water me down
Put my fire out knowing that I ought to be crowned
As the greatest, ever. I'll slaughter these clowns
Old ass A&R's wanna part of me now
My heart is a town, I invite niggas to live
Sky is what the limit is, so I'm living with BIG
My new bitch got bigger tits
And she did give a shit, does give a shit more than all you bitches did
Chivalry huh, tricks are for kids
Women dig, girls love. What Difference is this
Celebrities? Whatever B
Go head, sit in your crib
Take a sip of your whiskey
And dig what the kid speaks
Industry against me
This is a bitch B
Niggas hit a key, that'll get them a hit Gees
Can't get in the booth and spit the goddamn truth
But polo gets an award for a garage band loop
Shoot
For all that I'm ripping muthafuckas
Psyke
I'm a real musician muthafuckas
And I am the Mic, ya'll some Pippen Muthafuckas
The world is a vampire you living blood suckers
If you real then this doesn't apply
Pinky fingers up in the sky
Dislike me then fuck you and die

[Hook]
I know how you feel about me
Well I guess I feel the same
All you ever did was doubt me
The only true thing is my name
