Even without a dollar or a collar, I'm still blind now. Eyes closed when I look now. All pink when I look down, all black if I look up. Look up, then I'm back now. Background full of hood stuff.

So easy to kiss you, still kind of hard to remember the pain of that day. Not a Backpage. No massage, no menage. Go that way. I want to ignore. I want to explore you. I want to ignore. I want to be more for you. I want to call you adorable. I want to have 6 more in the room. Concubine, I want to [comp you time]. You make all my wishes come true. And it seems that I need to get it from you
