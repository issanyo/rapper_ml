I am so soulful, so global and a mess. And I’m so loco. Just describing me while I ride the beat. Finally, my time is free!
So with a tick of the clock, the hip that goes hop don’t be listening to “Stop!” when I give it what I got. Non-stop is the sickness that I give y’all. It’s like AIDS except it’s in the river. Get baptized in it, get sick. Soon as this shit pops it’s the end of hip-hop. Got to love it when I’m diving in. Because my sentence is a violin.

Soon as you see me, rise to your feet. Let me know that I am discreet when I get beneath the sheets and between them, like the Isley I mentioned befor-e (since I’m spelling it out). If you not my fella, get out! And if you ain’t a lady who is so wavy and interested in yelling, I doubt you! Which means out the house you must get I got the power, I powerhouse you!
