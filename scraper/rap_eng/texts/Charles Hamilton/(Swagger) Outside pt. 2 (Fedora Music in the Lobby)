[Intro]
It go
It go
It go

[Verse 1]
Soon as I walk up in the place they recognize me by face
Why do I need to about face and turn around
And look back at the shit that's wack I ain't got no book to look at
That is a fact
Nigga I just chat
No AIM I play no games
Off the head my nigga, but no Rogaine
Oh
So plain
Soul Plane matter a fact from the heart to the sky
If I start lying then that's when I start to die
But, roll that shit, toss that shit when you're finished
Nigga this ain't dice it's spinach
To Popeye
Niggas getting bigger
Bye bye
Voila
I got high in my mind
So, while y'all niggas standing outside waiting I been on the outside tryna make my way in

[Hook]
I don't like it on the outside
But that's just where you found me
I spend my whole life living on the outside
With everything around me
Got me moving in a lobby
Got me moving in a lobby
Got me moving in a lobby
Got me moving in a lobby
Now I'm living in a lobby
Now I'm living in a lobby
Now I'm living in a lobby
Now I'm living in a lobby

[Verse 2]
It's the, Mister, Hottest fedora
Like to travel like the goddess, Dora
And I ain't even gotta knock at the door
But one knock at the door
From a chicken door knockers and I swear her panties drop to the floor
Only because I never jotted it before
Sloppy with the raw
Still I'm clean
And you're feeling me
Nigga Mr. clean
Meets Mr. T
I pity anybody trying to bring some shit to me I'm too clean
Too lean niggas that's too pink
Too me since we playing that game
And I ain't trying to lay back it Maybach it
I'm just saying I may have it
Here's a topic grasp it
Great concept
Everybody trying to jab but they ain't drop bombs yet

[Hook]
I don't like it on the outside
But that's just where you found me
I spend my whole life living on the outside
With everything around me
Got me moving in a lobby
Got me moving in a lobby
Got me moving in a lobby
Got me moving in a lobby
Now I'm living in a lobby
Now I'm living in a lobby
Now I'm living in a lobby
Now I'm living in a lobby

[Verse 3]
Nigga gotta pick
Between the hottest chick and a blogger chick
I might just slide with a gossip chick
Get top and I'll pop her lips
Pringles
Or am I not single?
Nah nigga, I'm a album an anthology
Shout out my nigga Ant no apologies
If I step on your family when they in the crib
I'm innocent but I'm on that killer shit
Here's a raid, a serous raid
I ain't even gotta get no braids I just fade to the back like I'm sliding down a master fader
Y'all mad cause I graduated
Way above
I ain't in grad school I'm in There's a Whole Lotta Niggas Mad School
And that's mad cool
And I ain't mad at you
Matter a fact grab a sabbatical read about my attitude
Charles Hamilton

[Outro (Hook is playing in the background)]
I'm just talking shit
The whole joint talking shit
I don't know if I got swagger
I don't know if I'm that nigga
All I know is I'm holding my nuts right now
MTV you don't gotta put me on your list I know what it is
Can I get a honorable mention or something?
Say my name (Aha)
Ha haha
That's what I told Buster Douglas no homo y'all know what I'm talking about
Haha (Door creeks)
I'm just talking shit
Still the hottest shit I'm on my blog and shit
What?
