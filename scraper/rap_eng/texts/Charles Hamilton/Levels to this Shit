I hate to break the news, but in order to get famous you need dick in your anus. Which is why I’m fame-less. But when it comes to dot-com, my domain is the biggest name in the biz. That kinda bothers me, too. Because y’all think I’m a cyberthug and won’t dial you up and get wild as fuck. So now I got to do the impossible, which is try to be nice to you. I see a lot of people like to bother dude. Just to see me frown, just to see me down. I don’t fuck around, I snatch souls. Meaning, “Give you what belongs you, asshole.” Said that to Jimmy and to Barry and to every other faggot nigga that wanted to get married. I run the game and I’m suicidal. So you do what I do, when I do it

It’s hard to accept that Dilla’s still alive. But I carved his name into my arm. Would’ve carved it into my neck but then I’d need Abilify. Looks like I did it anyways, didn’t I?  Niggas act like I give a fly. Meaning shit. Meaning... And if you heard the zip. That means you should be on some nervous shit, because I’ve got a fever for onomatopoeias. I cannot believe the kind of guy that I would thought would be the shooter would the be the newer nemesis of enemy. This is just the genesis of me being a centipede. And I done taught myself how to do it within the game: be in the game, befriend the game, then end the game. Then be the player who ends the game. Basically for the game. What do you want, some refrain?

You want something nice from me? Ask me, please! Nigga, I’m carving as we speak! Sorry, Esme. But you probably don’t like me. Probably want to be somebody else’s wifey. Well, don’t do what Daddy does. Because Daddy’s love almost had us fucked up. And Daddy has a cup full of some stuff that will make me not give a fuck. Give me pot so I can puff. Niggas really want me on their side, as if they was broken. But nigga, I woke and I was the shit you was trying to claim. So die in pit with a rising name. I don’t give a shit baby. Buy me fame, buy me flames. Oh, you got to get to a level. A different level, a level you ain’t trying to reach. Because you ain’t trying to skeet and no one is trying to beat
