Yeah...

[Verse I]
However this starts is the way that it should start
Everything I say is from the heart
Laid in an apartment next to
Some woman who swears she doesn't need a check to respect dudes
Guess who, is she real or a metaphor?
It doesn't matter, cause to be real I'm forever bored
Alone is the word that best describes
Nothing in common, I heard you testify
Sayin' you know how I feel...No one does
Maybe I feel this way cause I ain't grow enough
Showin' love to hoes and thugs who don't know me much
Status in a rich mans apparatus
Leaves them to being my friend for their satisfaction
And me writing songs in an unhappy fashion
Tucked away to die another day
My bond with myself keeps me promising help
But...

[Hook]
No one cares how you feel when you live in a cacoon
Nothing ever seems real when you live in a cacoon
Cacoon
Cacoon

[Verse II]
Yo Charles, I know you got connects
Gimme an A&R's number, say yeah Charles, Make me a star
I wonder, if I didn't chill with big wigs and get a deal
Would any of these niggas feel chills when I spit the real?
A frequent question of the successful but
I don't give a fuck about success so much
You wifin' the bitch but we sex so much her bed was just my nest for nuts
But me being me I couldn't accept that it was lust
Yes it was, a mess because she didn't accept my love
Like everyone else I encountered my whole life
"Charles rap? You wild'n" now it's "Wow, he so nice!
His style is so like-" Ugh, fuck up
I grew up a fucking fuck up
I drown in waves I'm too curly for a touch up
So what up?
That's why my wrist is all cut up...

[Hook]

[Verse III]
Yo
I don't wanna feel alone anymore
No more 3am searchin' through my phone anymore
My mom keeps callin' I love her, but listen
Mom, you trippin', just for gettin' my attention
Remember rippin' all the rhymes I had written?
Instrumental CD breakin cause I was dippin'
In and out class to write what's on my mind
At the time
Which helped me not cause a Columbine
Bottom line I feel betrayed by life
So scarred I feel like I gave Blade a knife
I'm the fuckin' vampire that gave Blade a bite
Supernatural can walk through the day at night
I just wanna be loved by someone
But we all want some
One
