Get that monkey off your back
Heard money was for rap, hilarious
Niggas make money from rap
And all I do is just be running my trap
About what I'm going through
And I cause stomachs to get naps
Hairy situation, put my whole 'fro in
When I'm in your mouth or in your ear hole in
I speak what's going on from Brooklyn to Soul-in(?)
Never sold my soul it's never stolen
Therefore I'm it forever hoping the shit
I come up with will be dope and
You'll end up injecting it in your nose then
You got the swine few cure
I mean slime flu cure
I mean what the fuck am I sipping right now, who's sure
Of what you got. All I know is that I'm too hot
And they call me

Dr. Monkey, if you feel me
Dr. Monkey, if you feel me
Girl don't get funky with the monkey
Girl don't get funky with the monkey
Monkey, monkey, monkey, monkey

Get that monkey off your back
Looking real bummy in the trap
Because I'm the monkey and I'm the monkey on your back right, aight cool so keep shaking your backside
I'm a problem but I'm not your problem
So if i'm not the problem how can I solve it?
Give you a hug and I end up causing that monkey on your back to come out the closet
Toss it into a closet and never get dressed again
Just have sex after working like a Mexican
Sweat and phlegm
Either the flow or the extra lips that i'm kissing, yours
Your shit's puking, my shit's a bag remember I had
A vision of being a monkey
While I smash. Makes sense? Laugh

Dr. Monkey, if you feel me
Dr. Monkey, if you feel me
Girl don't get funky with the monkey
Girl don't get funky with the monkey
Monkey, monkey, monkey monkey

Dr. Monkey, if you feel me
Dr. Monkey, if you feel me
Girl don't get funky with the monkey
Girl don't get funky with the monkey
Monkey, monkey, monkey monkey
