Get a blunt, then see why a month is needed. Conceited am I when I'm fronting in the booth Because (in the booth) I can see why niggas is fronting. Because they wanting what they wanting and I'm getting what they wanting. Niggas playing when I'm rapping. And I ain't playing when I'm rapping! As a matter of fact, it's almost like "Dude! What am I saying when I'm rapping?" Kind of insane! Saddam Hussein when I'm rapping! Bombing those whose saying I ain't rapping. The same action. No Foot. No clim(axing)-. Just doing the exact same things as these guys who are trying to see how I can make my name ring. Once again, again and again. Jump in and finish the shit, if you can...
