[Verse 1]
Everytime I get the feeling in me
I'm a monster, niggas think i got the thriller in me
I'm a monster, niggas think i got Dilla in me... PAUSE
I hear the hate, see the anger, feel the envy
Don't make me no 'nevermind', cause i'm feelin spiffy
You don't like me? Then why the fuck you dealing with me?
I got poets, gangstas, and dealers with me
Ii got a chip on my shoulder, but yet I'm feeling friendly
I am who I am, y'all niggas still pretending
So everything you've come to know to be real has ended
You're hardheaded. This beat is hard as your head, which is funny
'Cause you're softer than Dharma & Greg
You're the type to act hard, then go talk to the feds
Well if karma does exist, based on karma, you're dead
Uh, Charles Hamilton: of course I'm the bomb
You think I'm invading your space, then report it to Tom. what's wrong?

[Chorus]
People always wanna be all the place that I be
Can't bring em, so i put it in a song
People got their own opinion about the things I mention everytime i put it in a song
Haters wonder why we couldn't get along
And then they get an answer when i put it in a song
So speak no louder, than a song and they'll be talking all day, talking all day long, c'mon

[Verse 2]
They say I got a big mouth
Nah I got a big soul, big heart
Do it for the love not to get dough
So when you see me going hard in a cypher
I make it so that it ain't never hard to decipher
My heart is my rifle, I'm firing from it
So when you see the smoke that means that the fire is coming
Rub, together two sticks, still ain't gonna do shit
The kid from Apollo leave you Rocky like a cruise ship
Who's this? New prick, being such a nuisance, fluent, loose lips, genius with the music, too sick, flu sick needle in the roof shit, you sick prove it, beat him with a broom stick to prove which one is the future of the shit
And I don't pop a hammer so I'm too legit to quit

So speak no louder, than a song & they'll be talkin all day, talkin all day long, c'mon

[Chorus]
People always wanna be all the place that I be
Can't bring em, so i put it in a song
People got their own opinion about the things I mention everytime i put it in a song
Haters wonder why we couldn't get along
And then they get an answer when i put it in a song
So speak no louder, than a song and they'll be talking all day, talking all day long, c'mon

[Bridge]
This ain't nothing but a pink thing baby
Uptown is the burough that raised me
I been hanging with my homie Kim lately
I'm in whatever car that she in like Ray J
She got a full tank of gas and its payday
And the music is the boss that pays me
I be all up on your windows like gateway
That's the reason that these macks wanna hate me
OHHH!

[Chorus]
People always wanna be all the place that I be
Can't bring em, so i put it in a song
People got their own opinion about the things I mention everytime i put it in a song
Haters wonder why we couldn't get along
And then they get an answer when i put it in a song
So speak no louder, than a song and they'll be talking all day, talking all day long, c'mon
