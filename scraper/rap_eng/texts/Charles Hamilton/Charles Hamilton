[Verse 1]
I don't care about no video hoes
I got a really old soul, like video soul
The name's Charles Hamilton as if you don't know
The nigga so cold, I can spit and flow snow
There is no limit that a nigga won't go
My shit is so coke, I can spit a boatload
One sniff, ya nose glow, I'm on my give and go flow
Give 'em hell, then go tell like I pitchin' nose-owes
And they snitched the po-po
Livin' so close to the edge, that I gotta be a christian, no joke
Givin' no hope but I'm livin' So dope
That I give them hoes ropes, and syringes, no coke
Uptowns finest, girls say I'm the finest
The finest, my mind is what the line is, define this
Time to rewind the, admire the name
So if they don't let me in
I'mma die for the game, c'mon

[Hook]
You know my name, you know my game
You love the way I do my thing
You know myself, how I gets down
And love the fact that I won't change
Nothings changed, I will remain
And stay the same... my name is

[Verse 2]
A classy girl said that I'm movin' too fast
Which is funny, cause I don't think I'm movin' at all, get it?
You see, music is a virgin, but I'm not!
So she can't get upset when I'm removin' the bra
See her mouth is saying no, but her lips is sayin' yes
She don't need lip gloss cause her lips is stayin' wet
The sooner you cum, the quicker they forget
And that's the reason why I ain't penetrate yet
I been a straight mess, from a tender age yes
And I am a great threat, cause the kid is a vet
No tennis bracelets, or gimmick made reps
Just spittin' straight reckless and gettin' paid (YES!)
Only minute maid lemonade, pink color'd kid that made
Another color look cool, since Renegade

[Hook]
You know my name, you know my game
You love the way I do my thing
You know myself, how I gets down
And love the fact that I won't change
Nothings changed, I will remain
And stay the same... my name is

[Verse 3]
The industry is nothin' but prostitution
And propaganda, a constant nuisance
I know y'all been waitin' on me to drop the new shit
Without further a-do, watch the movement
So watch my movements, and cop the music
Captain Planet rappin' dammit here to stop pollution
You can see my name in the constitution
TRULY YOURS CHARLES HAMILTON
THE GOD OF MUSIC, ONE!

[Hook]
You know my name, you know my game
You love the way I do my thing
You know myself, how I gets down
And love the fact that I won't change
Nothings changed, I will remain
And stay the same... my name is
