I hope everybody chilling tonight. No need to get mood or be illing to fight. I'm willing to write but right now my skill is in my sight. And I'm killing what I like. Which is this beat and the chicks with the hip who are so thickening it's too deep for me to try and holler. My boner in my jeans got me a loner, it seems. So I'm sitting at the bar, wishing to the stars that she walks my way. Awesome! Can I play with my babe for about 5 minutes? Then I go away. My babe is the glass that I'm sipping on.
