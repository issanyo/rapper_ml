[Verse 1: Theodore]

First off Charles man thank you for the beat
All I do is go hard y'all are hardly in my league
I'mma kick this verse off with some karate in a Gi
Man I'm bodying the beat, I'm bodying the beat
6 foot 2 bet my arms can reach
Under the right arm rest there's my own army
I don’t condone guns unless they're armed on me
Dog those songs aren’t dope and I'm a smart start key
I swear I'm blinded by the pictures
Cause my car dash like shes out with Ye'
Tamper with the old inspection sticker
And hope its not called out today
Float around the place
I'm so high
You mope around the place
Your so high

I'm like fuck the bank teller don’t be interested
In my dank smelling sweater what I said or did
Word to the eighth letter but that H won't fit
Cause I don’t wear belts though my waist so thin
No materials, just fiat money
Build it all up and make a treetop of it
Rolled Zig Zags I got a Reebok deal
What I do all day man you need not wonder
I'm either in the booth or waiting on drugs
So its needless to say that I'm creating a buzz
Chef it all up I need an apron and gloves
Talking bread, cheddar, chips make a million for lunch
Dead presidents to get Ben elected
I shoot the bank up waiting on that appeal
You heard what Young Scooter said only snitches get deals
So I keep my mouth shut cause the pens too real
