Bohemian, fast forward, indeed a trend. Mad morbid when we begin. Orgasms, deeply friends. Back then we were laughing. To be with... Continuation, ellipsis, deep sentences. We kiss when eyes are closed. You reach in when my eyes are closed but I'm awoken. I see the end when I'm provoking you to be you. To be you and continue to me be. Losing me in you. Miles infinity, I miss thee

I let mind be all about you
I let my body talk about you
So why I can't I stay away
When you're all I want to say

My Co-D when I'm on Lithium. Before you I tried to OD. Before I tried to OD I met a pretty one. The pretty one disappeared as I arrived from my OD. Tried to OR with she or without she, now I don't know she. And I don't know thee. You are so you. Beautiful, too. Martinez on the radio. As hard and as smart as we can get. We do don't say so. So, we don't say. And what we know won't go away

I let mind be all about you
I let my body talk about you
So why I can't I stay away
When you're all I want to say

Looking for a friend, now I'm looking for a you. Close to the end, so what I'm gonna do? Spot you a mile away, Siphon Filter. But niggas want to play Halo and I'm on a filtered mic. My innocence over my head, you shooting buckets, what you would usually do. I would say fuck it too but love is what is involved with us. As we continue, Diddy and Puff. Sophisticated, sipping a cup, getting a puff. I miss you, baby

I let mind be all about you
I let my body talk about you
So why I can't I stay away
When you're all I want to say
