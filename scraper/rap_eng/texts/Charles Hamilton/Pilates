[Verse 1]
About 5 foot 4 with thick thighs
I took more than her inner seams of her denim jeans when I tried to fit inside
This is why this dime is a riddle
She don't have to treadmill at all but yet and still her cat calls for walks
So when she walks she hears cat calls
Her cat so fat but she small as if fat cats can get involved
She lacks fat, petite! But American gladiator physique
Switchin' up her frame like mystique
Twistin' up the game like a cheat
Kissin' and lovin' is pretty plain to another dame in the streets
But here I am I aim to please
But with my eyes on her thighs my aim is weak
Eyes on the prize 'cause the game needs me
And the pain of her stretchless stretchmarks is unique

[Hook]
She's a goddess and she just wants to work on her pilates
And she just wanna work on her pilates
And she just wanna work on her pilates
Don't kill 'em with ya thighs, girl! (work it out)
Don't kill 'em with ya thighs, girl! (work it out)
Don't kill 'em with ya thighs, girl! (work it out)
And she just wanna work on her pilates
And she just wanna work on her pilates

[Verse 2]
I went to the gym with her
Just to find out her excercises how she does that grip thing when I enter her
She like.. does pull ups with her legs
Good enough to play but hood enough to play dumb
She does a hundred jumping jacks, makes her thighs clap
So divine such actions could make the sky crack
Sweat drippin' from her gym shorts
Pours the polar spring bottle down her chin, I'm like "of course"
She must be flash forward into later tonight
I'm on her ass more than swings at the age of 8
I'm gettin' tight
An hour or so to go
Would hit it in the shower if I only was allowed to go
Bad enough it's an all womens gym
And all the women are lookin' at me crawl from the scent
I'm like damn..
(She's bad.. She's bad..)
Damn, I can't hit in the gym?!

She's a goddess and she just wants to work on her pilates
And she just wanna work on her pilates
And she just wanna work on her pilates
Don't kill 'em with ya thighs, girl! (work it out)
Don't kill 'em with ya thighs, girl! (work it out)
Don't kill 'em with ya thighs, girl! (work it out)
And she just wanna work on her pilates
And she just wanna work on her pilates

[Bridge]
Be gentle, I'm fragile
You could break me in half with that ass (x 3)
Yes baby, I'll behave
Don't worry..
I'm passive agressive with the mind of a tyrant (x 2)
Be gentle, I'm fragile
You could break me in half with that ass (x 3)
Yes baby, I'll behave
Don't worry..
I'm passive agressive with the mind of a tyrant (x 2)
