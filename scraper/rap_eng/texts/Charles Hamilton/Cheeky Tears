Maybe I'm just like my mother. She's never satisfied. Maybe I'm just like my father. Batter my mother until she cries. I was after my mother's diamond eyes, then she reminded I that I have diamond eyes. So how can I get away with lies? I get away with murder every time I rhyme! But I keep my eyes open, hoping somebody can see what I am not reading. Which is the bottom line that I'm hoping is still being seen when I'm speaking.

Depression getting caused, when I'm spitting bars. But it's the depression I'm living with. Loving lust and I'm giving kids
