[Verse 1]
Whole new experience
Dead on the dance floor
Lance at the floor
Lights put you in transform
Lance in the storm
Made evil on the baseline
Pimp to the regal give shivers No tracelines...
With the grace of a mind-gettin gloomy Dormroom shouts to the roomy
Groovy, Grew me
A new beat flew the coupe with ease Soothe the beat by super-gluing ur feet
To a treadmill(sit still)
Red pill(get thrills)
Like I said chill, let's get ill
Bartender hardly remembers her liquor licence
So I get inside it...
Sit in silence, following instructions
Move them body parts
Hollow with the substance
Drop and give me nothin
Advertisements
I Happen to ignore, I'm rappin alzimers

[Hook]
All black disco ball
Different color lights
Sisters and brothers let's get it right(x3) Get up off the wall
All black disco ball...

[Verse 2]
Low blows, hydro, ex-girlfriends
Parents say don't go, No
They already know so they brainwash children
Pain installed the main frame is the still thin
Here I am grilling the cameras for filmin Apparently ill but ferris ain't even thrillin' when you lose your current state of mind and
Go snoopy, I don't know who would be try to go and ruin me
Domino effect when I find em so it's you and me
Mr. Stepping on my shoes and bruising my feet
Groovin the beat Who is the beast? Truthfully me
Music indeed, 2 in the breeze for being cooler than me
Gruesome is the scene, woo in the peeps Super human swoopin rumors off their feet Before the Internet I hit you in the head With some shit to lift up your chest
This is sicker than the minutes I rest...heh

All black disco ball
Different color lights
Sisters and brothers let's get it right(x3) Get up off the wall
