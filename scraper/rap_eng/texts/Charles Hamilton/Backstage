[Verse 1]
Uh, Backup, gimme my space
We ain't cool, hell nah it ain't safe
I got cash, now you're all in my face
Where ya been baby girl?
Don't worry I'll wait (I'll wait)
First time? That's great (That's great)
Quick, fast, 'cause I don't do dates
Uh, I break and you late
If you handing out taste
I'm the top candidate
That grape jelly
That peanut butter
Don't hurt yourself in them coochie cutters
The way you movin', girl I love ya
Want you now, you ain't hear me stutter
Uh, alright now, nigga pipe down
In front row 'cause your girl loves my sound
Better cuff your chick when I'm in your town
Don't save me girl, you let the whole town

[Chorus]
Just a pretty girl backstage
Yeah, do what you gotta do to get next to me
A pretty girl backstage
Do what you gotta do to get next to me
Make me feel good, like you last tour
Oh, make me feel good, like you did last tour

Make me feel good, oh

[Verse 2]
The way they waiting after the show
It got me feeling like a kid in the candy store
They make me feel so special
Wish I could take them all home
But I can't choose one, so I close my eyes
Like eni, meeni, my nee
I'm back in this bitch like an accident
Rockin' nothing less than South Central fabric
I knew that I had em once I seen the laminate
Just wait in the hallway to mess with my flesh
Let me reach, reach deep in your chest
And hold your heat I won't apply pressure
I only send signal the brain can translate
To visual messages
I don't know how you as far as I can throw ya
That's what I'm telling my boner
'Cause you looking better than LA Beach days
In the 80's, with the taco lady, sippin' Corona
But you made it backstage without me
So y'all can't be the only
You can't be the only

[Hook]
Just a pretty girl backstage
Yeah, do what you gotta do to get next to me
A pretty girl backstage
Do what you gotta do to get next to me
Make me feel good, like you last tour
Oh, make me feel good, like you did last tour

Make me feel good, oh

[Refrain]
If you act too important, bitch
I'ma kick yo' ass out
If you act too important, bitch
I'ma kick yo' ass out
If you act too important, bitch
I'ma kick yo' ass out
If you act too important, bitch
I'ma kick yo' ass out

[Bridge]
Oh meet me in the bathroom
Oh, I'll give you a chance
Meet me in the bathroom, yeah baby
Alright, I'll give you a chance darlin'
Unless you just another
Just another

[Chorus]
Just a pretty girl backstage
Yeah, do what you gotta do to get next to me
A pretty girl backstage
Do what you gotta do to get next to me
Make me feel good, like you last tour
Oh, make me feel good, like you did last tour

Make me feel good, oh
