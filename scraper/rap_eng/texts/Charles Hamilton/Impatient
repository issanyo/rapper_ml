Brown skin-ded. Pretty nose and pretty lips. Might be the new Mike Jackson to you idiots. But please. "This Is It". Shit. Trapped in the Mike/mic trap. Back in the mic booth. Black on the Mike/mic. That's ...what happens in the mic booth. And on the top of the mic/Mike is a black wire. What's inside of it is color. No rainbow, but I'm that fire. Sorry. (I'm) 'bout to burn the red. If you got headphones on, nigga turn your head. You gon' see the Blue. Peek-a-boo! Yellow in the middle. Bitch, I'm reading you. Damn. Sonic outfit. And that's between me and you. So when another nigga spits, it's between me and you. No Ja. No, I won't stop. Oh! I'm so hot! Read my old blog for the stuff I jot now... and look ahead with the new shit!

I gave you my heart like it was AOL
And you tore it apart like it was AOL
Cocaine in my heart
Hey
"Oh well!"
The one to save me from my heart break
Heartbreak

How do I start the first verse of the rest of your life? Because you'll think about the first verse for the rest of your life. Or for the rest of the night. Or, for the rest of The Night. Taking a rest on knights, I move with my pawn. Take a rest on the mic. Move it. You're gone. You lost. Dog gone. I'll be the nigga who's Al B. Sure! when I log on. One sight. At least with my brows/Browz. Niggas is like "Talise, turn him down!" Shit, I don't know about the niggas Talise is turnin' down, but none of them niggas is coming in the house I'm leasing now. And this house is my house. Feeling like James Cleveland. We ain't even. Only because I'm a decimal off. And yes, I'm talking to the boss

I have just exhibited skill. Niggas then give me a pill. Lyrically, I give you a chill. Then, I try to chill. Niggas like, "Chill!". Chill. "How many times you gonna say chill?!" CH is Ill. Okay. Great bar. But y'all niggas acting like I'm not a great Bard. Okay. I'm from Outer Space, y'all. Shakespearian with a pin in my ear. But I got a pen on my ear, thinking about how am I gonna grin to these peers? But y'all ain't my peers. Y'all peer at me on the microphone, I appear happy, but leave my life alone. You've been shitting on my life, my skill(s), my wife and the people who "chill" with me at night. And night's whenever I black. Or whenever you press play whenever it's my music you lack
