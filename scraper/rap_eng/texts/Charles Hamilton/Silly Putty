[Intro]
(Go!)
Let's go!!

[Verse 1]
It goes... Day time I sit awake, whine about the night before
Night time, I lay awake from tasting crazy wine
I'm bored. Spinal cord is blinded from the silence that's missing
The vibe is different. I'm riding the rythm and licking the private of the bass line ,cause it reminds me of a pretty chick
Same time I enlighten the mind of the idiot
I am the finest keeper's clause and tryna be a boss
Knight in shining armor my stars are all the brightest. I'm a star
Heidi Fless tried to ride it hard, then she got violently tossed, cause my bars are like SARS.
She coughin' from the kicks of which a coffin tossed for kickers in the ass of all the talkers sayin' Charles is trash
Fall back I'm the summer night you never felt
Some can write, but I just number type and move in better stealth
Gruesome, what I spell when I ouija board flow
Wanna see me more? Say you want me at an award show

[Hook]
I don't know what it is
I mean I know what it is
I hear a beat that I did and I (start goin' crazy)
And I, and I, and I, and I (start goin' crazy)
I hear a beat that I did and I (star goin' crazy)
I don't mean to be ruuuuude, duuuuude
But.......

Ay! Ay! Ay! Ay!

[Verse 2]
My ghetto pass liscense and registration is valid
Let em' pass life as a way to me and my talent
I got me a goddess Aphrodite is my wifey, and I be all on my praise and worship nightly
Tell her open up Pandora's box. She like, "I'm sure you're hot, but make sure you're not scorin' with a ballin' bitch."
I said, "Baby, why you call her bitch?" she said, "She got no personality, it's all her tits
You fall for hips Mr. Hamilton
That's the reason why you have to clap or keep seated when this track is beatin' in your black beats."
But I go so pro, I'm BOSE, I supose. Whoa
Just wait until the Hamilton headphones have you jammin' to Hamilton neck zone let's gooooo
What you think? I'm just gon' hand you my ways?
Insert an insult from Andrew Dice Clay, like heyyyyyy

[Hook]
I don't know what it is
I mean I know what it is
I hear a beat that I did and I (start goin' crazy)
And I, and I, and I, and I (start goin' crazy)
I hear abeat that I did and I (star goin' crazy)
I don't mean to be ruuuuude, duuuuude
But.......

[Bridge]

[Hook]

I don't mean to be ruuuuude, duuuuude
