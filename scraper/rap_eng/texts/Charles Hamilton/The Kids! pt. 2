I am beyond, so much for the song. I don't understand how I have a mom. All I understand is I drop bombs like Saddam or Hassan. Pick one! Listen, son and daughter, all I'm trying to do is get y'all in order. If I get y'all then y'all will be in order. In order to get y'all my life has to be in order. You can blame your mama for that. Or let her autograph my backside, with my wack rhymes. The beat's crack, that's fine. Pass that to the freak in the back. I'm the hustler of the millenium. Kind of new when I rhyme to a groove like this. I do my shit. Disco move it, I knew what it is

Every single child go wild
I've been trying to reach my inner child
Are you free right now, this second?
I can take you close to Heaven
Are you free right now, this second?
I can take you far from Heaven

I am beyond, no reaching me. Damn, why did Cudi find my frequency? I have a conspiracy, seriously. But we know he can't freak with me. Unless he frequently switches into one of them bitches that be with the sixes, sleeping with me. The irony, like MF DOOM trying to ride with me. I don't need a mask like Future, I just need a mask like Future. A punchline that a lot of guys would understand if they did not have an ass that was like Fushia. Or maybe they penetrated him? You don't know who he is? Save it, then. SEGA, my friends. The end. This is just the second verse. We begin

I am beyond. Children, I'm sorry if I'm wrong. I've committed sins so horrible, I'm surprised y'all are listening. And then I'm gone. I do return though. No turnstile hopping, just turn over pages in a book. Get amazed when you look, unless you're looking through my eyes. Do I try? Honestly, yes. I've got to  be the best, no Kanye West. I'm not arguing with my flesh. And it's a wish to slit my flesh.  But y'all kids ain't gotta do it, there's Jesus. And there's the favorite phrase of us, which is "believe us." We need you, hopefully you need us. Far from a pre-nup
