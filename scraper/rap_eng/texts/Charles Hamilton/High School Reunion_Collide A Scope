[Intro]
I'm sorry I missed that one "uh"
I just wanted you to hear that clap

[Verse 1]
Now tell me, how familiar do I look to ya?
When I was down and out, could I really look to ya?
That's why I look through ya
I look super on the cover of the mag
That's why I cover my ass
Because I love 'em and cuff 'em, I don't fuck 'em and pass
But when I nut in the mag, I make sure that I cover my ass
Cause for a couple cash buckets, shit could get mad public
And I'ma be mad like "fuck it"
So I'ma say it right now, ya can't have nothing
Cause I rap so fucking rad, I got mad cousins
Couple real niggas, couple cats bluffing
That's fucking sad, bad luck is on they ass, rushing
But my D is always up like pass rushing
Ya'll like "Oh!" Cause you can't get past nothing
Get past those few bars, you're a challenger, yay
But I got you mad and shit, watch me challenge a play, hey

[Chorus]
You're in a place where time stands still
Where you were then is where you are still
Your high school reunion
Get acquainted with yourself like you're living life as somebody else
Your high school reunion
Get acquainted with yourself like you're living life as somebody else

[Verse 2]
One of my main concerns
Is that my brain is stained with germs
Cause I still remain a nerd
I came from the 'burbs
To the most gangster and urban part of the heart of the city, Harlem
All of the gritty problems, I ain't deserve
But thanks to her, I made sure my name is heard
In the most insane verse, your brain has heard
So to maintain my nerves I get brain from Jane
Who's maiden name is Perv
She switched it to something different when she slipped on her pimpin'
It was very strange for someone to marry Jane
So high, here I am, oh my
Here I stand, I'm waiting on the usher to go by
He wanna walk down the altar and I don't mind
I'll just stand here at the back of the church, rapping this verse
See how I changed this verse?
I should've put my name here first, Charles Hamilton

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Damn, I was going in on the second
I ain't mean for my name to be how I ended the second
But I was so going in that I stretched it
Like sexin' a kitten that ain't never been messed with
You step in the kitchen and you're begging for breakfast
You leaving on a fast, switch to evening on your ass
Please hate yourself, take a L and un-C-H yourself
You're lunch meat when I'm mad
Another syllable was needed, but too bad
I hope I can keep a secret with English cause I spaz
You know that I beat the beat up to pieces when I rap
So I believe the reasons people greet me is for the cash
Can't even be a hippie, even poetic
If you ain't got no green then forget it
They will put a lien on your credit
No purple drink
Just a guilt trip for not buying a purple mink
And that's why it hurts to think
Word to pink
That's why I think my verses stink
I must be crazy or something
You niggas trying to play me or something
Ya'll ain't Dame, I ain't Jay-Z or nothing
Haha... Woo!
By the way... Charles Hamilton

[Chorus]

[Outro]

In the halls of my memories
I hear them call like they remember me
But I'm the story that makes them all reflect on just how crazy life appears
In my kaleidoscope (4x)
Something on your mind, you need to get it off....(10x)
