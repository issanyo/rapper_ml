Brain cells going numb. Eating Hell, painting stealth. The pain from the belt when I’m hung. Same kind of guy that felt the lies and replies of all guys that rhyme and make tracks. Break tracks in half until I’m done. As long as I am the one slaughtering the drums in line, then I am the one. Not Nick Cannon, not anybody who copped a nick' and tried to say "CANNON!" after everything I said, God damn it. All I try to do is damage as you're moving candid into my eyesight, into what I believe is not right. If I wrote this down you say I was a clown. But I’m focused now, so lay that shit down

Baby girl, you know I sho' nuff love you. Girl, but I've got to leave you when my restless heart says it’s time to go, it’s time the go, it’s time to go...

Now, let me focus on who I'm focusing on. I hope you think this song is dope, because the focus of this song is you. And it's been that way ever since, um, true. Hard to understand how I don't have you. Part of the plan was to grow past you. But if I don't, fuck if I don’t gloat. And I don’t really know what you hold as a ‘gasm for you. And I hope I can do that for you, moving you back. Hopefully you know that the dopeness that I probe is just a clue in the sack. I can go even deeper than that. Perhaps I need that rap to feature, so I can beat you from the back and have that cat asking for ether

Baby girl, you know I sho' nuff love you. Girl, but I've got to leave you when my restless heart says it’s time to go, it’s time the go, it’s time to go...

I ain't accept vibrations with you. I can make it if I can kiss you. I can do the distance thing with the violation because I've been taking [bow] and eating it. Sitting it down, telling it secrets, then spitting it deep into the mouth of the people that kiss me. And they kiss me by listening to the style. And the style is different. I'll be getting different when it's differently considered the essence of speaking, which means speaking with blessings completely. And the day that I'm not blessed is that day I'm obsessed and having hot sex with the S-E-G-A thing itself. And I ain't in stealth

Baby girl, you know I sho' nuff love you. Girl, but I've got to leave you when my restless heart says it’s time to go, it’s time the go, it’s time to go...
