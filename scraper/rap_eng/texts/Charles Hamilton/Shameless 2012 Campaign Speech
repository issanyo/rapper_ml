I'mma have niggas stuck like
What's sitting up right
Have y'all living a muck
And I ain't taking about Pokemon
'cuz niggas be reversing my shit, so I know my stroke is on
Having niggas hoping wrong
Sometimes I'm seeing niggas smoking wrong
Nigga I be like I hope it's wrong
Going on and on but I know i'm strong
Damn, did I just slip?
Niggas give a fuck when a nigga throw a discus
Nigga throw a fit then just discuss what justice is when a thrown fit gets blown
Nigga now my whole shits blown
Pause, Now a nigga gotta get grown
Of course, in front of all of y'all
Since I was how many feet tall

Still seeing straight nigga everything clear
Still seeing straight nigga everything clear
Still seeing straight nigga

And if I got
Awww fuck I fucked up
But since half my shit is hot
I guess y'all niggas is all stuck up
Expecting me to clean my shit all the time
I'm the meanest with my demeanor and I spit all the time
So I'm cleaning my demeanor like I'm cleaning my bunk
And these niggas acting like I'm cleaning my junk
I'm on some mean stuff nigga steam up some skunk
Maybe I can lay and dream of a monk
Beautiful monk, Wonderful liar
Wonder if the fire I provide is fire enough
To get you to back the fuck up
Or go the fuck in if I say you must
By the way you musty and I love it, this must be love
What kind of luck does he have

Still seeing straight nigga vision is clear
Still seeing straight nigga vision is clear

And in the middle of shinin' I get hit with some fear
As if I got hit with some beer
Listeners cheer
I don't know if I'm getting a jeer or if I'm gonna be the best spitter of the year
But make it clear
I got ruled by a Derulo
On radio, shit wasn't cool yo
Now I'm looking like a fool 'cuz I'm some dudes cujo
And a friend to a new pro
Holy shit it's New Co
Here we go over and over
As I look at my view, woah
One long trail trail, and this could be a song derailed
Now since when do I start doing the
Stretching the voice until you ruin the listeners view of what you giving them
I mean that's not what I'm trying to make them but shit
Make- hah. Aw shit
Alright

Still seeing straight nigga vision is clear
Still seeing straight nigga vision is clear
Woah, oh
Yeah
But y'all know
