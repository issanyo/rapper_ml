[Verse 1]
Uh
It’s like a fucking Ouija board when I’m spitting
Don’t act like you ain't see me before I’m living
I’m giving niggas Charmin if they think shit
I think sick you’ve been fired here’s the pink slip
This ain’t communion wine, what you think bitch?
Steve Nash with Dominos this is a deep dish
A free bitch like Victoria what’s your secret?
No Beckham I bounce after I check em
This ain't rap this pain rap call it Tekken
The bartender give your bitch some vodka then we Effen
VH1 the video will pop up on the net
I know where you too be I got your friend request
Someone should have told you ass not to get me stressed
This ain't truth or dare but are there consequences? YES

[Hook]
Everybody look at me, me
Take a real good fucking look at me, me
I’m a ghost, look at me but can’t see me
When I walk in the room you start tweaking
Brace yourself this could get intense
Close your eyes use your own sixth sense
I don’t know who you think I am
I don’t know who you think I am
I don’t know who you think I am
I don’t know who you think I am

[Verse 2]
Supernatural, best way to describe it
Lose you matter, wait for the next day just to find it
It’s all mental, uh, it’s all simple
Not at all a riddle
It’s just a small vision nigga it’s just long division, add it up, take away what you want
Either way I’m handicapped imma stay in the front
Being racist is fun, you niggas can’t hang with me son
O-K-K-K, hate the game I’m making it fun
The soul of the devil
No control I’m a rebel
Getting wasted off of the bass, someone sold me the treble
Narcotic, arsenic, Charles, Sonic, bars, got it
I’m talking about something I’m the god topic
So ask me if I care if my bars are over your hair, grow an afro for my rap flow asshole
So here’s the Charmin I’m a piranha with this
You a gassed bitch with a big head, Rihanna and shit, OH
Where’s your umbrella, I make it rain on you dumb fellas come get em, heh
Uh, uh, haha
Uh

[Verse 3]
Alright Sorry Rihanna, you know you still my baby mama
But again imma piranha no time to be lady charmer
These niggas don’t respect chilling
They respect killing
So expect to have your chest have that dead feeling
Biggie had it backwards there’s death after the life
You try to Pimp, see you the next rapper to die
How the fuck is a dead guy the best rapper alive
Charles Hamilton bitch step back from the mic
Yall children in this thriller, step back from the Mike
My lawyers suggests that I don’t press cats on the mic
But I’m all about the mic unless cats want to fight
But a threesome is the last time I left a scratch on a dyke, you pussy
Hahaha
Woooooo! Because
(I don’t know who you think I am, I don’t know who you think I am)
(I don’t know who you think I am, I don’t know who you think I am)

[Hook]
Everybody look at me, me
Take a real good fucking look at me, me
I’m a ghost, look at me but can’t see me
When I walk in the room you start tweaking
Brace yourself this could get intense
Close your eyes use your own sixth sense
I don’t know who you think I am
I don’t know who you think I am
I don’t know who you think I am
I don’t know who you think I am
