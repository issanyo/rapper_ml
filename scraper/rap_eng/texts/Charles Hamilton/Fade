[Verse 1:(Hambino)]
She fade, with a misdirection
Straight blamed me, but that shits projection
Yo, i'm smarter, and i'm stronger than that "Break-You Text"
And still I couldn't never win, it's like a fixed election
She fade, gets so reclusive
Never downtown, cause' she's home refusin'
All the heart I gave, no harm, no shame
But she cuts her wrist, no, and scars don't
Fade
[Chorus:(Kevin Scampoli]
Nothin' on him, never downtown cause' the counterpart is
750 down, with the problem well hid
Men sing out loud about his bits
Nothin' on him, never downtown cause' the counterpart is
750 down, with the problem well hid
Men sing out loud about his bits
[Verse 2:(Kevin Scampoli]
Drink in hand, while she's turned fessing
Mace in hand, while she walks the street
Bitter fare for the bus'es seat
Well tingle's growth spouting at her feet
Fade ours into her journey
Endless stare as he falls a sleep
Well her despair doesn't even blink
It stings, it sinks into her dreams, repeat
[Chorus:(Kevin Scampoli]
Nothin' on him, never downtown cause' the counterpart is
750 down, with the problem well hid
Men sing out loud about his bits
Nothin' on him, never downtown cause' the counterpart is
750 down, with the problem well hid
Men sing out loud about his bits
[Verse 3:(Hambino)]
Like a motherfucking hairstyle
Bitches used to phase me, homie I don't even care now
Bitches love to hate me, i'm superior like Flair's child
Put the chair down, i'd rather beat you in a stare-down
(?)... You got me running like i'm praying now
Used to run together, shattered everything we share now
(?) down, pushed it to the point beyond repair now
And all she is to me is just some smoke up in the air, wow
Fade
[Chorus:(Kevin Scampoli](x2)
Nothin' on him, never downtown cause' the counterpart is
750 down, with the problem well hid
Men sing out loud about his bits
Nothin' on him, never downtown cause' the counterpart is
750 down, with the problem well hid
Men sing out loud about his bits
