(verse 1)
Is it lame that I didn't enter the game to get a whip and a chain
I refuse to become another one of these nigga slaves
That give away they soul just to get a chip or a day
A chip or a day, maybe some money, maybe some chips and some haze
Maybe some honey that'll shake they hips to the way this hit got played
Brooklyn girls got disrespected by mainstream radio
They hate me, say it slow
A lot of people are against me, maybe because the people are lewinsky
Not the people that are my fans
But the people that say I suck so I could give a goddamn
About your opinion, just say goddamn when my flow gets mentioned

(hook)
Gimme that, gimme that, gimme that peace of mine
Gimme that, gimme that, gimme that peace of mine
I don't wanna fall (x 2)
From grace

(verse 2)
I am the king of self de-pre-ciation, somebody help me please
Creation, I must've been left out of it
...damn, left out of it
I guess being left means I'm out of it
But then again you left me when I was out of it
So tired I doubt this shit'll make sense
Unless you have bouts with a bitch
Look in the mirror and look down at yourself
Look down, there's a crown, and there's help
I asked for help before, but I guess I need shelter more
Feeling like helta skelta when I melt the door
I meant knock, then again this is hip-hop
Most metaphors get taken out of context
Which is why this shit is considered a contest, I'm the best

(hook)
Gimme that, gimme that, gimme that peace of mind
Gimme that, gimme that, gimme that peace of mind
I don't wanna fall (x 2)
From grace

(verse 3)
The way the universe works; karma shows
That anybody that try to harm the flow gonna end up in some kinda spotlight
In my mind, I'm not right
In your mind, I don't write
In my mind, I just write
Don't mind me, mind yourself
Mind your business
But then again whose mind is this?
Why is my mind in this business?
Can't give these niggas my soul, as if these niggas know
But no.. most of these niggas ain't even niggas at all
It's not race, so why would you call these niggas?
When you need some help, I ask myself
But then again Pac asked why he shouldn't blast himself
So as I stand with a pistol, I hope one of your mans have an issue with me
...Charles Hamilton

Gimme that, gimme that, gimme that peace of mind
Gimme that, gimme that, gimme that peace of mind
I don't wanna fall (x 2)
From grace
