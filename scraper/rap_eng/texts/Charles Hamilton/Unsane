Red cup life. Dead up, dead on the mic. Fed up with the people who are in their head like: to be head lice and the guy who behead lives. I read the mic. Overdose or be comatose. I boast the most when I'm coasting on an overdoseage, so you know it. How many hoes are poking? How many hoes get poked then. Your earlobe is in your nostrils. Nostrand Ave., and my local cats. So focused when I rap. Overdosing and you know it's a fact. But I'm not really giving you much of me, because I feel such is a disease

Sooner than later is the future
The future is waiting for you sooner
Sooner may never be the future
I am a doomer, a goddamned doomer

I remember playing ball with my cops, meaning my pops when he was up top in my mind as the most important thought. Wasn't sleeping on the cot until kindergarten. But I realize it's been retarded to have such feelings in your heart when niggas was departing, leaving. Dolly Parton this evening, big chest. Bench press. Bitch press, listen. Get a guess, then get a lesson
When I stress then it's extra phlegm. Meaning I'm spitting what's inside. Extra cousin and fucking cussing of mine. Ended up busting in my mind. I'm cussing in discussion and discussion when I'm the fucking Russian of these fucking button-pushers

Sooner than later is the future
The future is waiting for you sooner
Sooner may never be the future
I am a doomer, a goddamned doomer

Fear. Kill. Hear. Feel. The real deal is here. Each part of the Reaper makes your heart beat even deeper. The heartbeat is a creature but your harp needs to be released. The angels of danger have come to strangle you in anger. Are you dangerous? I ain't got my fitted on neither so my brain just gets insane with this. Unsane, pardon me. I'm refraining from being the arteries of the heart that bleeds. You kids ain't gotta start with me. I simply want to be a part of thee. I want to be your best friend too. That's why I keep it simple, but don't let me get mental

Sooner than later is the future
The future is waiting for you sooner
Sooner may never be the future
I am a doomer, a goddamned doomer

It's like I died of Polio the way I overdose
And tell you what you're supposed to know
I've reached a high where time leaves my behind
I thank you. I ain't you. Should I shank you when I go to jail?
