You're so beautiful, it's hard to tell you the truth. Holding on to my belly button while I'm falling in love with you, because I'm puking all the lust that I had for others who had the potential to have the lover (who is me) in their eyes(,) forever. And we tried together, but I let lust intercept what I feel for you. And I try to keep it real with you. I told you every secret I have! The secrets of the past. The secrets of EVERYTHING that would make you laugh. It's like an on/off switch. Can't help but tell you all this shit. You bring out the honesty in me, and the lack of honesty is why you had to leave

I can see your pain
Babe, I caused your pain
You know what?
I did it 'cause I love you, babe
When you call my name
I can feel the flame
You know what?
I'm really in love with you...

Antennas in the sky, holding the silence that we provide every time we (violently) wanna ride with each other. Either in the streets or in bed. It's even more of a secret kept when we sleep. Because each of us are in debt to pain. We're so beautiful, yet the game don't know that we're usual. We're cruising. though! "We're doin' it!", so anybody else who be "doin' it" should know. What are we doing? Moving in love! Just to be ruined by my touch. Yes, your DaddyBug actually loves all women. And THAT he does involve himself in. The love for women. My love for music is almost just beginning

I hate the sound of you crying, but I'm the reason why you're making the sound of crying. "Hey! What kind of Satan am I if I can't make the ladies ride with... him?" Look. I'm like the evil Drake. Even though he's evil anyway. And you understand why that would make me laugh, but you laughing at that would make me cry. We're even. I'm giving you reason to be the ending of me, even though I believe in you & me. We need to be. At least, in the eyes of they. Because they don't see exactly what we are. We are the essence of the stars. And if you leave me, I will crash. And there will be no use for bars, would there?
