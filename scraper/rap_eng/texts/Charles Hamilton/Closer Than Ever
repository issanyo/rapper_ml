I'm allowing you to watch me collapse. Nothing bothering my back as it lands on gravity. Actually, asking for me is the past to bleed. I used to want to be a pastor, so I can lead a whole church of me. But now my words are free. So is the style. So is the beat. I didn't have to pay. I'm sorry, Rih, but passion led you my way. If that wasn't enough to make you stay, then maybe I got to retire and lay. My whole silence is staying by the side of those waiting for me to die. I trust you, because at the end of the day you're giving me a "Fuck you!"

We are closer than ever, as if they found out
We are closer than ever, as if it's downtown
Closer than ever, I'm all around doubt
But all that it means is you're closer to me

So how much closer can we get? Can't stand the shit: My manuscript is getting considered wack by niggas who ain't spitting nothing. So how they mad that I'm spitting crack? Only the hood get it. Even the hood that's stuck with the good of the non-hood get it. And their good is not meant for the hood. And that's a problem so it's popping on behalf of the hood. Because we're all stuck. And I'm the one being called washed up. Like I don't talk enough. It only comes out in the music, so it's got to be soothing. It's a whole 'nother movement. Charles Hamilton on the chops and the keys. Stop it, please, because these keys were not played by me. More like something that should stay away

We are closer than ever, as if they found out
We are closer than ever, as if it's downtown
Closer than ever, I'm all around doubt
But all that it means is you're closer to me

And now you're distant because of my loud resistance. I get down, I get it. But to get down ain't enough - You got to be a clown or a thug. A clown as in ICP, and I am a clown when I see me. Except I'm not hilarious. I could be the scariest thing because death is living vicariously through me. It's me, truly
Kiss me then move me to the house of a groupie. So I can show her how to love. Because the kind of love is not a lot love that she gives. And that bothers me a lot, what? And I don't like to be bothered a lot and such. And to be honest, I like this stuff

We are closer than ever, as if they found out
We are closer than ever, as if it's downtown
Closer than ever, I'm all around doubt
But all that it means is you're closer to me
