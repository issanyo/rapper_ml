[Verse I]
I wish I could be rich and still live in Harlem
But I can't be rich and still live in Harlem with no problems
So I stick with stardom
Livin's harder if you're smarter than wishin' you could live in Harlem rich and get no problems
Me and HCho smoked ourselves into yesterday, and made the present
Future haters just step away
We see life in a screen made of plasma
Even created athsma so this song could take your breath away
I give up is something that we would never say
Every day we levitate the feather way
But the weather may cause drifts
All this concious shit for y'all kids talkin' nonsense
Retarded
Nigga slow up, but even retarded niggas grow up
As the wind blows down my back, I reach within myself
I think I found my lack of faith

[Hook]
And it all comes from you
The incomplete circle
Who the hell are you?
Why are you inside my circle?

[Verse II]
How real can I be before they kill me?
I see they lookin' guilty, but me I'm feelin' built recently
Niggas took turns breakin' my trust
That's why I'm breakin' my buds on a plate full of love
And I'm pissed they violated the dutch
The one I poured my heart into, they would rape it with lust
But it's cool, I learned something new
The purp was high enough so now I burn something blue
Guess I'm a cop after all, but cop that in the fall
My top hat couldn't fall if they blew me
I don't care if it was cryptic
The perpetrators of this sick shit can't miss it so nah
I ain't actin' different, I just walk smoother
So much for trippin'
Let your guilt be the reason we dap zone out
Motherfucker start receivin' this rap
From the soul

[Hook]

[Verse III]
I'm a check to some, no respect from some
Put 'em in check here's an extra one
The following 'Suck my dick' goes to the niggas that say the love my shit
Look at the budget and then try to cut my shit
Then question the fact that it was just my shit that got me here
So here:
Suck my dick, yeah, use a lotta spit
But you probably dehydrated 'cuz you suck a lotta dick
Got it prick? Not a scent, no cologne around me
So keep your fuckin' Blackberry phone around me
I know you know about me
Roam around free, clothes is wild pink
Murder me, I dare you
Oh wait, how the fuck you gon' blow without me?
I'm the win
...Next time you hear my name

[Hook]
