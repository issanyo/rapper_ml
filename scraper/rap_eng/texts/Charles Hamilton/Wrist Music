[Only verse]

Hello wrist, I'm focused
I know the pain of the game is what you don't miss
I know the vibe of the dye is what I go with
No females arrived in lotion
Had to drown my pride in the ocean
I wrote this with my brother beside me
Only in love with the lover inside me
Or so I think, so he covers my blind sleep
Another fine week gone in the commode
On and on it goes, finally I get along with pros
Finally I can see the pretty thong of hoes
That live and Google, I have what you long to know
Get mad cause I wanna go
Get glad when I'm comfortable
Get ass in a wonderful mansion
But much like my visit to Hampton, I'm sick of this campus
That's word to the letter you serve
I feel myself get depressed when I get better with words Niggas shoulda left me dead on the curb
Head full of lead, cause I curved on what I said
Merge with the best when I sleep like a bird in a nest
Can't go further, I'm left, behind
Just like the kids who are assured to be next in my favorite biblical context
Did anyone else read the book?
Don't believe me, then you need to look
Rap wise, I'm Jesus good
But Jesus in the hood is G'd up with stolen Visas
So I crucified the crucible
Do or die, suicide my view of why I'm beautiful
Who am I? Someone you should-
Don't ask any questions, because of what the future holds
The scum of the earth have a gooey glow
So I'm on Jupiter, makin' a movie tho
Me and my white chick, milk of magnesia
Shittin' on rappers like I feel a bad fever
Ms. Simone, my favorite pornstar makes me
Miss Simone, my favorite star
A star was born when she walked in the door
The Starlight zone, don't talk anymore
In the future she gone have my lil daughter
'Til then, I'm rappin over a track from Mr. Porter
The sickest scorer
But when the source of sorcery forces me to be a sicker slaughter
I pick the audible play for my naughty ways
I talk today to see tomorrow, don't walk away
So at the end of the night, I say have a nice day
But tonight might stay
Time and space get split when I get violated
So I see and say, pull up and let it rip
Me and J in the whip
Spot some fake gangstas so we pull up and let it rip
Tell the family, they shouldn't have said shit
Don't wake em up from the casket, let em R.I.P. Get a grip, mine is a sedative, and I'm wylin' (find me an exorcist)
I'm the man now, on some Mega shit
Niggas always wanna bite, on some Tera shit
But they walk away broke, on some beggar shit
I walk away with hope, on some better shit
Talk to dames for the throat, on some never shit
'Cause I got respect for they lips
But if I ever have to check a bitch, no lie
Point gain, check, bitch
