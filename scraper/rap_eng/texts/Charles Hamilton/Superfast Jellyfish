I got super-duper siblings and they're super-duper listening. So I'm super-duper glistening. In this super-duper spitting thing called a booth, I'm the super-duper spitting thing. So, all of you, listen with your super-duper listening things while I do this super-duper listening thing. Cover your head with aluminum, super-duper! On top of those stupid super things... strainers. I'm an off-the-brainer. Kind of like this one guy, my brother, he's a complainer. But he can transform, turn into Rhianna. Probably another anal situation. But I ain't trying to bother you. Foil my plot, your boy isn't hot. Until he gets inside of you, reading the plot in two. Wasn't as hot as one, but we get as hot as you when you...

Super fast! Super fast! I come in last!
And this is like our breakfast
And it it's true. Oh shit, it's true! I'm never blue!
Me and my big brothers. Me and my little brothers
Yeah, my brothers and me
Yeah, my brothers and me

My other brother is super-duper white, but he becomes Black when he's super-duper tight. Then he becomes a fat chick, I mean a thick Black chick, and that kitten's super-duper tight. The super-duper type she is, she's super-duper nice when she write and shit.  The power of super-duper thinking, positive. So I gotta spit some super-duper positive shit, to get in her twat and shit. I'm super-duper nice when I'm jotting shit. But I'm super-duper in the process of not-ing shit. Notting Hill, in London like a lot of this. Undone Werewolf, where your watch is? Super-duper loving the chick. And I'm super-duper loving the kid. And he's probably super-duper duping me, stupidly. But musically, I'ma show a lot of love because I've got a lot to give

My super-duper brother is a super-duper killer, like the super-duper others who be super-duper killers. Yeah, he's super-duper Dilla. But a super-duper 'gov'r,' meaning super-duper governing me while I'm super-duper cleaning all this super-duper stuff. It's a mess, a super-duper mess. He's super-duper obsessed. Super-duper "Stupid, do it! You so stupid! And I ain't even fooling!" (I'm talking about me), but you the one who's schooling me to loving me. The super-duper me who be governing me when he ain't think it's my brothers and me. Blame it on my cousin and me. Yeah, I'm kind of stuck in the beat like Gorillaz. And the gorillas is feeling him like (aluminum). Just assume that they dumb if they want to hate on son. They might be vampires but I'm the greatest one. They all suck, but hey, you like to say it's fun
