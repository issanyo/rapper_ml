StH: Zero
I just want y'all to take you imagination into reality

Blue streak speeds by
Look in the mirror and I can see the sky
Red kicks as fast as it gets
Always having to shake my ass for this shit
You know how that go
Not really shaking it or being an asshole
Just telling you "You mad slow."
Cats can't get as fast as me, so they get mad at me
Pretty sad to see, I'm happy to be blue y'all
I'm happy I once blew up in front of y'all and brought it to y'all
I want to relax and kick my feet up
I be running in my sleep as I be leaving in Jesus
Believing in Him or be-leaving in Him
Like a crucifixion you need to see him when he's spinning
He doesn't spin like me
And I'm not evil, but can't no villain grin like me

[Hook]
Sound is always there within my mind
How am I not Sonic is a question of mine
Without my blue I swear I'm deaf dumb and blind
Or is it time for me to lose my mind?

The SEGA reunion
I was the baby of the movement
Charles Hamilton: may be crazy but he be doing music
He really loves it, and we love him too
How could the public not love him, is that true?
Of course my tattoo is Jay Dee, carved on my arm
Sharp as could be was the razor
The razor was silver, or was it Silver?
Or am I just getting iller while listening to Dilla?
And of course Shadow the ultimate darkness
Kind of led to a hard defense from me
Cause I always believed in my darkness
I see him and I see me, I see why I'm retarded
But he's not a reflection, as a matter of fact he got some news from the west wind
"Yeah you're Sonic in your mind
But there's another Sonic I can find"
That was his bottom line

[Hook]
Sound is always there within my mind
How am I not Sonic is a question of mine
Without my blue I swear I'm deaf dumb and blind
Or is it time for me to lose my mind?

Turns out Dilla is Sonic
So all my music from 2008 -- feel it or not -- he got it
But what about me? I spent my existence being blue
Like I always did with my depression, trying to see it through
I see it's true too
True to the blue, true to the speed
Is he possibly truer than me?
More than likely, cause blue is the sea
When it's not polluted, you see?
And the R-E-D is like your eyes when you're high
I find out I was Sonic meantime when I was high
So I probably got lied to
This is all a big conspiracy
So please understand why I don't think you're hearing me
The fear in me says i'm honestly dead
And this is a dream come true, but in my head
And my eyes are still closed, so at least I still see pink
But honestly lately I don't see anything
