[Intro]
One night when I was dreaming, or awake
I had A dream that 9th Wonder was J Dilla
Don't let it be a lie
Aight

[Hook]
I can Drown a Lake In this Pool
Tears Of a Clown, My make-up Is through
Dreams Of a Clown, I'm making It through
Seems Like A Clown May end School

[Verse 1]
Poetry In motion, Go to Sleep and Open
Wake Up, Underacted
Unattractive Is never gonna happen
So just do a Back flip
And Let your ass touch my lips
I could be talking To the Corporate University
Or the chick that flirts with me
Or either way, Certainly
It kinda Hurts my Feelings Cuz you don't really know the perfect me
It hurts to Sleep
And this Is poetry again, You know I'm goin' in
Smell the Newport just blowing In the wind
Hair Blowin' From the sin
I'm not Marilyn Monroe but I can make her cum slow
Its Charles Hamilton Houston
Nigga, I'm at It again
My darkness can Make a Seal hook sound Gray
But doesn't this too? (Wait)

[Hook X2]
