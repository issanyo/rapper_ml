Fuck a scoop, I psychically cut my dick off. So get off, I’m the rap Eric Bischoff. Gray hair, tell a little bitch get off wherever I’m at, or stay there. I remain here, I remain fair. They remain queer, I remain in a staring position. I don’t care for a minute, literally. Let me not give a fuck. I need some pot to puff. A bad bitch that has a lot of stuff that I can fuck. Because I don’t give a fuck. Fuck am I given? I gave it to SEGA. So what for these players? Press A, press C, press B, you see me directly. See me, easy

You never loved me
You never liked me either
So what i’m ugly
My music might be ether
So breathe it in and breathe out
When we begin, I hope so

Fucking voyeurism is annoying when I’m pissing. Can’t enjoy when I listen. Everyone has the same senses as I. When I slide inside my bride she’s like, "Quit this!" Forget it. This is not Qudditch, I just need a quick dish. I turn a bad bitch into Steve Nash. Now all the has to do is relax. Pass me the ball, Cardi! Fucking retarded, where is the party? Can’t fuck with me if you wanted to. I’m under you. But how though. Is it because I was out cold. Or is it because of what your mouth told. Fuck her, fuck those too. I don’t need Pro Tools

You never loved me
You never liked me either
So what i’m ugly
My music might be ether
So breathe it in and breathe out
When we begin I’ll explode

Want me to ghost write? I’ll commit suicide. Until that day, don’t write. Don’t like anything of mine, because you really can’t sing along with my rhymes. This ain’t singalong with the champ. I crush the Rock like Mick Foley. Stamp! Like Seal, like my grandmother. Stand her up because I can’t hug her. Thanks a lot, family. I ain’t got a goddamn Grammy. Sacrificed so much to grow up, to find out y’all can’t stand me. A razer blade across the face of those who were saying I should take my dough and rake it slow. Wake up, Hov

You never loved me
You never liked me either
So what i’m ugly
My music might be ether
So breathe it in and breathe out
When we begin, I hope so
