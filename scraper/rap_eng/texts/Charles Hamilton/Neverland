[Verse 1]
It seems like the signs are getting clearer
The time is getting nearer
I finally can hear you when you speak, as a whisper
Through the view of the wind
I want you to do it again
I'm your true blue friend
The music is when
I get to prove to you how true it begins
Where am I? Somewhere asking "Where are you?"
"Does your man care for you?"
That's what I'm here to do
Spend a lifetime telling you how sweet you are
Through sex and questions see how deep you are
I believe you are
I know you wouldn't say what you say everyday
If your words were just play
But you don't say shit, it's all vibes
And it only looks real when the crystal ball shines
Spending all times of the night in a daydream
Thoughts of you make me trip across time

[Hook]
You take me out of this world, I live in
Never-Neverland
Never-Neverland
Never-Neverland
You gon' always be my girl in
Never-Neverland
Never-Neverland
Never-Neverland
Let me take you to the sky, we can
Never, never land
Never, never land
Baby hold my hand
I can be your man
I can make you understand
Baby let's land in Never-Neverland

[Verse 2]
It gets cold standing outside your window
Especially when I don't know your zip code
To put in the GPS, drive to you
I don't know where you at, but let me fly to you
Why do you, seem so elusive
Thoughts of you are like my dreams of the music
Ever present, I have a heaven fetish
God is a woman, bring me to life, Evanescence
Be my immortal lover, wrapped in your mortal covers
Supernatural spirits
Human bodies loving more than others
Love each other
Let's be the love that they say I'd never get
They expect me to bug
But no couple could be as sexy as us
Especially cause God bless we, much
Cause us can be led to winning a race
What we got is bigger than space
Get it?

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
I know, I sound like I thought this through
Well, I didn't, I just needed this talk with you
When all this is through and we fall into true love
Will I be the one to get all of this screwed up?
What happens when the groupies crawl on my two nuts?
Not coming back until August is too much
And bloggers are rude
Any sorta problems would be the talk of these poo-putts
It's awful but far from new to us
Just promise you'll be gentle, I'm sensitive
My weakness is sweetness, I don't give a shit
After a long day, rub my head
My favorite Incubus song play
And the bong's gray
Full of smoke, high, I'm full of hope
That's the cloud that I'm on, and it's not bullet smoke
Don't be a murderer
Feel me?
Charles Hamilton

[Hook]

[Outro]
You know, I think...
I think somebody gotta come up with a better word for special
You got that word, right?
Let's just zone out
I don't even care if it's on beat anymore, let's just zone out
