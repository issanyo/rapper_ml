Where to? I dare you, point me to the erection of destiny. Next to me and, Blessed be, you BETTER BE. But I dare you to stare at other dudes. I know I'm not worth your time but I got the perfect mind and if I hit it from behind you're gon' have a hurt spine. That's just how it's going to go. Squirt time. Flirt time with another chick because you love the dick. Got to hit another chick up so she can love the dick then have a piece of the government. Then "Peace" to the government because I want peace and I'm loving it. We need to be brothers and sisters. But that's all coming from a shy guy who gets high all the time

I'm so shy, I feel like you can read my mind
I'm just a little boy who caught your eye

Rape is bad. Niggas got shows called Breaking Bad. What, they trying to rape breaking, or break rape? Nigga, fuck that! That means TV is a date rape. It's like these niggas got 8 states, and they all red. Looking for blood. What's the point of an election? You should be looking for love. You find it in the strangest. I found it in one of the most dangerous spaces. The lady that I lay with, majorly amazing. I thank love. But there was nothing but gangsta love. But rape ain't gangsta, cuz. So you better stop raping for love

Where them niggas with the fitted caps? Where the bitches who want a nigga with a fitted cap? Let me put y'all together. If I hit a nigga in the cap with a Gat, you gon' be man-less. And I'ma be the big piece of Manwich that you just can't stand, bitch
