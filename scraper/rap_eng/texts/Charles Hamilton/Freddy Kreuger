I got the whole world zonin' in. For a moment, they already know I'm about to go in. This flow is so sick! The disco flow. Having these disco kids wishing they can grab a hoe/ask the hoe if they can smash it. So, I'ma be the prom leader. DO NOT GET ON A DIVA IF YOU NOT GON BE HONEST NEITHER. The other side of you is trying to "do it". I can move it. The whole movement of you trying to screw her. She's gonna say "That guy's the future." I'm a loser. I said it myself. I'm incredible. And I got incredible wealth (only when I lay with ladies who's incredible in stealth; meaning when they like to stay to themself with me)!

Tell me what you don't like
Tell me what you won't like
(Now watch it be me)
Tell me what you don't like
Tell me what you won't like
(Now watch it be me)
You won't like me
(I can make you hate me 'cause you ain't me)
So STOP THAT LOVIN' ON ME!
(I can make you hate me 'cause you ain't me)

Y'all said for me to switch the style up. I did that so you can get your smile up. This is wild but, I can tone it down. Like, "I kinda drove around this town, trying to see if niggas is tryna get down with the chicks in my Towncar." They all like "Wow, Charles. You gon' give us away?" I'm like "Listen to me. I'm tryna listen to Jay, while I'm getting a fee. Charging niggas 'cause they can be with thee." I mean, "So they can be with you." But I ain't mess up. I create, the evil way. (laughs to self) "And y'all gotta believe the view. All the things we can do." I mean, "I can do. But there's so many different me's, every time I spit, I make HIStory." Let's go!

Tell me what you don't like
Tell me what you won't like
(Now watch it be me)
Tell me what you don't like
Tell me what you won't like
(Now watch it be me)
You won't like me
(I can make you hate me 'cause you ain't me)
So STOP THAT LOVIN' ON ME!
(I can make you hate me 'cause you ain't me)

All eyes on me, but I'm not Pac. This is GothHop. "I feel like I just got hot." And I ain't gotta blog no more. I ain't gotta talk to y'all. I just go to Baltimore. Smash the chick I got in Maryland. Think about marrying. Then she wanna carry HIM over the altar. She mad brolic. And I'm mad Gothic. And she had my dick. But, only when my eyes were closed. And I was sleeping. And she dove off the deep end. Woke up all bloody. Told me she love(d) me. "That's what you get for trying to fuck me when my eyes are not open. I'm hoping we can get it in again, so hoe, go in." She not focused. I understand it. I am the "making love" bandit. Damnit

Tell me what you don't like
