[Verse 1]
Miss Mirror doesn't like me
Yesterday, she said there is no one like me
But today, she said beauty is my psyche
And I'm crazy; there is something wrong with what I might be
"I see," was my response to my reflected image
Eff demented, I'm sick enough to find a message in it
Unless I'm livin' to serve of me, I am me
How can I not feel worthy... of the love that I require from the universe
And the universe is undiscovered, but this universe is to be first
Cause this is my dwelling
Tell Miss Reflection not to miss me, I'm tellin' the whole world her weakness
She knows it isn't me...
So she kissin' me to get closer to the deep
Should I let her? No, cause she buggin'
And if I slip, she will tell me her feelings mean nothing

[Hook]
It's not up to you (to make me feel like I never did before)
It's not up to you (to make me feel like I wanna live for more)
It's not up to you (to love me until my heart can't feel no more)
It's not up to you...

[Verse 2]
"She's so pretty," I say as I watch the pop singer
Pop and lock and bring her man in front of the camera to show off
I live the life of a nobody; that sight makes me wanna go off
Hold off on all criticism;
Loneliness...
Only makes me dwell in all my homeliness
How can I help but feel ugly?
They say I can't dress, feel a weight I can't stretch
I made a damn mess on my knees to clean it up
I need to beam me up, I'm Scotty; not a hottie
But there is two of me, my mind and outer body
So I don't mind my body being blinded by the "probably"
So don't question me, or what I stand for
Surf on your brain waves, and I don't need a damn board
How can niggas say they fly when they can't soar?
I got wings, you on the damn floor, that's why you got hands for

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Last week, I peeled dead skin from off my face
Using a old butter knife, what a life
I ate it; laughed before I spaced
That is what I mean when I say I bite reality I face
Taste it with red wine
This is no one else's breakfast except mine
Except I did this before bed time
And had dreams of bubble baths made of pesticides; homicide
Genocide; suicide
What side am I on? Can I die when I'm gone?
So I think I'll just stay here and suffer
With open wounds to appeal the blood suckers

And I'm still healin'
