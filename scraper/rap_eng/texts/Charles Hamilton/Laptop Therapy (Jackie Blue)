[Intro]
That's on everything
I Dont ever have to leave the house
If i dont want too

[Verse 1]
Gun slinging sun dreaming with the sun demon
Steering clear of some demons
Run freeman
King of the sample
And no i dont want seamen
I keep runs on they feet when im steaming
This here is my home in the sky zoning
I am my own BMI
My thoughts beam from my eyes to the screen
In your mind MTV When i dont want to do
Late night interviews with who
Isnt in the least bit into humans
Nigga view my music from inter tubes
Just a matter of time before i brake into the news
The mic is my anchor Popeye Cool J when i write in anger
Cause even with my life at danger
I can always write a banger

[Hook]
You want help
You want love
You wish you can find someone new
Making wishes that never come tru
You want guidance
You want silence
You Want a new kind of friend
Ive always been here im here to the end

[Verse 2]
Imagination dies when your certain
Or does it simply hide behind the curtain
Showtime i grabbed the opening curtains
To see how many people can get a hold of this circus
You tune in enough its a funny site
Left handed handling the money right
I left damage to handle the money
So these left bandits can't handle the hunger
Thatll write in front of me
Thats a pyramid scheme
The left write up get midas to touch
The light that i just get up with
Blessed with Florissant evanescence
I dont lose i just take a minute to win
Takin a break to pay for the sins of the fakers
Who grin to make it a vacation spent
Shit why dont i just take a break again

[Hook]
You want Help
You want Love
You wish you can find someone new
Making wishes that never come tru
You want guidance
You want silence
You Want a new kind of friend
Im going places that youve never been

[Verse 3]
The whole planet can change my diaper
You kiss my ass while i aim for the whiper
No names i remain a viper
Just more kane than Wayne
The rap Zane Im a writer
Everyone else is no names in the fire
That type of fame has expired
You either a rider or a no-thin
I am the spider beside miss muppet
The system im quiet like fuck it
Then i step in iller than black nazis
Which isnt ill cause black nazis are rappers
Back to plotting for back to back probabilities
While i nap ontop of the lottery
Stacking what i got on my lap
Alot of heat me and my laptop
Thats my therapist Honestly

[Hook]
You want Help
You want Love
You wish you can find someone new
Making wishes that never come tru
You want guidance
You want silence
You Want a new kind of friend
Ive always been here im here to the end
