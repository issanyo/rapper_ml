[Verse 1: Charles Hamilton]
Catholic school education, but low expectations
Ask my teachers, I'd either thrive or never make it
Dedicated, my head in the Matrix
Eyes look redder than Satan, I'm so blatant
No vacation when you try to be a legend
The underground tyrant, vibe with me a second
Thank you Republic for the reintroduction
The game says they needed the substance, I love this
I'm still paranoid about the public
I know way too much about injustice
Childhood disrupted by my cousin
My pops did it later, he's like my biggest hater
But I think he loves me if you can love
I'd kill him if my heart gun wouldn't jam up
I'd forgive but my heart bleeds
It's hard to be me, no parties, voices talking to me

[Hook: Sam Bruno]
I hope you always say that you're sorry
Every time that you're wrong
Yeah, and I hope you get back up
If you ever have to fall
And I hope you learn the lessons from it all
The lessons from it all

[Verse 2: Charles Hamilton]
I stay to myself, like a monk
Out of body thanks to the blunt and getting drunk
Kamikaze facing you punks, get me jumped
Your Maserati's chasing my trunk, what you want?
I drive you to the brink and put the club on
I don't make club songs, I make bug songs
Like a wired engineer, higher than a leer
My high is what you hear
Am I a pioneer? Only the gods am I trying to revere
Pain so deep, I'm crying through my tears
Headlines depress my mind when I'm reading them
Whether mono or poly, we need some kinda theism
Not idolatry, I don't care if you follow me
Don't be a wannabe, be what you gotta be
Take yourself out of nature and see not a leaf
And these days I'm rocking a lot of green

[Hook: Sam Bruno]
I hope you always say that you're sorry
Every time that you're wrong
Yeah, and I hope you get back up
If you ever have to fall
And I hope you learn the lessons from it all
The lessons from it all

[Interlude: Charles Hamilton]
If there's anything I've learned while living this life
Is that there is such a thing as giving too much of yourself
I ask myself every day
But as long as when you do, you have a pure heart
The universe will restore you
Say to yourself
This is my restoration, these are my lessons

[Hook: Sam Bruno]
I hope you always say that you're sorry
Every time that you're wrong
Yeah, and I hope you get back up
If you ever have to fall
And I hope you learn the lessons from it all
The lessons from it all
