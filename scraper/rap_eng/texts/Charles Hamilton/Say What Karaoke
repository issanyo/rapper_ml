I wanted to keep shit simple
But the simpler I got, the harder this album got

Ignorance is bliss but you're giving me top. The rhythm rocks, I'm on top of it, nigga. Gotta be the hottest rocking the rhythms. If not then stop with your living. Providing the rhythm is what I need to do, but the label needs to see proof
Gotta see it through, regardless. My music isn't garbage, are you, retarded? Going hard with it, the smartest. The target also of all of this. Believe it or not even if I ain't breathing some pot or being deep in some twat, better believe that I'm hot wherever I go. Hot as in opposite of bibles but as holy as one. The holiest one. Holy shit I'm flowing until I'm done

I don't want to let it go, I don't want to let it show, but something's in control of me
I don't want to scare you away but there's something's in control of me
I don't want to let it go, I don't want to let it show but something's in possession of me
Music is in possession of me
The future is in possession of me

The microphone decked me because of my words. I can get so deadly when I'm a perv with rhythms but I prefer to get it in with precision. So any kitten that purrs word to the shit that I'm spitting now is getting down with the bounce that I'm spitting with perfect incisions, slicing into your depression, giving you deep lessons. A prerequisite, we guessed it but I knew it. But I was with you so I became we, we  became us. people wake up we are not strangers.  Deep in the game goes my anger. I believe in the pain so my bangers are for meant people who got outer space with it. Not taking up your living unless you need it

I don't want to let it go, I don't want to let it show, but something's in control of me
I don't want to scare you away but there's something's in control of me
I don't want to let it go, I don't want to let it show but something's in possession of me
Music is in possession of me
The future is in possession of me

Niggas mad at me because I smoke cigs. OK, but I also go in. There's no way cigarettes block my focus unless addition is what I got to notice next. Holy flesh, my skin is ripping, not muscles, I've gotten in trouble. I see blisters as if I don't see whiskers from a cat
Shit, it's the Year of the Cat, Al Stewart. If it's not the year of the cat, aw, screw it. Y'all already know what it is, the Cat in the Hat is back and I flow from the wig. Leave you open unless you want a jester to come through and front with a gesture of making you feel good. Nigga I'm real good, real hood. At the same time I don't feel good

I don't want to let it go, I don't want to let it show, but something's in control of me
I don't want to scare you away but there's something's in control of me
I don't want to let it go, I don't want to let it show but something's in possession of me
Music is in possession of me
The future is in possession of me
