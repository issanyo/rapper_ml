If you misunderstand, there's no pen in my hand. So what I'm grippin' can enhance your listening. Damn. The way I do is the reason why David Stern made A.I. move. You know, gave him checks to move with. Excellent solution. Make the Black man bounce for the change. But now, there's a mountain to gain. Volcano. It's all Kano. Rip your heart out. Talking is an N-O, O.K.? No way could I end up the M.O. for an emcee to slay. No way. I stay in the booth, and I say what I say. Making the truth in the major-est way. Saying the truth, 'cause today is today. Creation is who I will make it away with

Defending myself from people who know ending myself is the way I move to Pluto. Like a Drake freestyle. Now I end up the great beast (now). "How could I beat him?" I found out. The reason I'm now out of the season. Climbing out of my doubt is my bleeding. I saw MYSELF bleed. And a caught an orgasm. So help me. Perhaps "The Dark Side" or "The 6 God" or anybody who's been sending shots could get this shot: FUCK YOU! I didn't need YOUR help. But now I gotta make more melt. THE SUN. THE REASON. Each one'll get reached, then I end up having to teach one

I had all the knowledge in The World, then I lost it. Mind gone in a coffin. I'm strong in a song but while I'm walking, any guy could stalk and off him. Because I'm a pacifist. I just let my rage escape when I'm not rapping over 808s. So let me make it today! My rage in a cage got me staying away from people. Because if I swing, they could swing harder. By SUMMONING ME! I'm DONE WITH THIS BEAT! I'm telling the truth. Stop making me hate me! I hate me already, because of yesterday's scenes. Now. While I step away clean, look at all this mess you've made, TEENS! Blessed is the day where I can escape clean from the situation and STILL end up breaking beats
