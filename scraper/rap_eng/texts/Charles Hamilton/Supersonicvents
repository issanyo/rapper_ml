I'm sonic that means sound I make noise
You can't escape noise, especially great noise
If you hate noise die, mute yourself
But you would even hear noise if you shoot yourself
Abuse your wealth of knowledge
And be broke like losing your scholar-
Ship for college I could stop a storm
Reason why I spent more time watching porn
Than filling out a FASA form
Plot for more pray for it all exspect less
So I get more than I get stressed
I rest in a mess of thoughts of my mess-
Age is when it gets mishandled
And often lost in this pitchball? society
Pissed off cause hip-hop is dying
And we reverted back to Kris Kros
WWF rap, so soft I bet lip gloss was a hip toss
Get lost pop ass acts ironically I'm that cat
Who would benfit from all the crap, it's wack
Cause damnit I backpack, I rap facts
While you guys rap wack, I'm back at
Where I was at before deal so I don't care where you at
Everything about everthing makes me everything
So FUCK my enemies I want every ring
Fuck your heavy bling I ain't poppin shit
Just watch how another rapper gets robbed again
I pretend like I gotta Glock within
I remember how Pac got shot and I begin
To get wise as shit, "watch your lips"
FUCK YOU put a sock in it
All the rivals are watching him
Fans reading my blog and see the shit I get in-
To common sense say "Charles tone it down"
I don't hear you bitch I'm zoning out
They say I rap with no emotions
Naw I'm just to real to show emotions
Until the day that I decided to get homicidal
Ill ride with a silence with slow emotion
Might take me awhile but I'll give a fuck
Smile listen to I'm wildin my pictures up
You like animation right, here's some spunk
In junk I spit shit is this what you want
I feel like smacking these journalist
Music was pure, word, them niggas murdered it
The talentless prevail while the cold shoulder
Is giving to those who's pros and flows with both the perfect fit
Goes to show how slow most of these professional hoes
Can go when the dough shows who the person is
Fucking right I'm going berserk on this
I'm so sick that it hurts to piss
I don't need a head start it will burn your lips
Don't get enthusiastic curb it quick
Larry David to you Gary Paytons
You ain't really work for yours but I'm really sure that you're happy waiting
So much so you would marry satan
To get hot again until you realized you'll be unhappy baking
I woke up to take a piss with this verse
I wash my hands of it, nigga pass the bacon

Good morning, good night
Sonic The Hamilton
