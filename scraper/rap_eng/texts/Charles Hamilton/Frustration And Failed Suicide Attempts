(Intro)
Who would've known the scariest sight is me looking in the mirror
Feel me on this

[Verse 1]
Well hello again, you know who it is the motion is swift
Wait until they get a load of this
Dismissing your questions suggesting that I am not the best
Since whoever had the best since the exit before I snatched it
Direct hit, no bullshit I leave cats breathless
Death is like a chick I got history with
Sometimes I wanna visit the chick
But she trips and pisses me the fuck off with all her bullshit
So I quit
Which is why I feel blessed to live
Yes I did stretch a bit
But I'm kinda short and my message is
To think bigger than your average nigga
Colorless, I love to dig, ya dig? It's for the love of it
So you can't be mad at my frustration
I'm just pacing, dammit I'm just waitin'

[Hook]
Maybe I should end it all tonight
One shot could end it all tonight
Huh
Maybe you can blame it on the hype
But I'mma fight wit all my might
You know
Give ya self a chance
Give ya self a chance
You tried everyone else
Now give ya self a chance
Give ya self a chance
Give ya self a chance
You tried everyone else
Now give ya self a chance

(Talking)
You know sometimes it's crazy to talk to yourself in the mirror
Especially when your mirror reflection says some shit like this

[Verse 2]
So many demands will enter the hands
Of the many damn glances that want to know what's in your plan
Don't let 'em sway you into doing what they want
They close in the zone in which you existed once
The close-minded no violence could happen
The whole silence is co-founded in magic
The other founder is power
And in time you will gain
Magic is something that in your mind you can't explain, bang
Why do I trip when I look at this mirror?
Couldn't be clearer, my rival is me, how can I be defeated?
I only die when I sleep
Might get caught sleeping but never caught slippin'
Y'all gettin' on my nerves, why y'all trippin?
It must be the laces
They bitin' my tracks so they must need embracing

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Give myself a pat on the back
Kiss my mirror reflection, said matter of fact
What's wrong with knowing who you are when you are great
Happy's a hard way to think
I put on a smart face, little smirk too
And told my reflection, "talk crazy and I'mma hurt you"
He said, "suicide, you tried by virtue"
Doesn't matter what you think you can do
Just know what you can do
And your soul is pink mixed with blue
Think this is true? You crazy as me
Spacey as I can be when I space on a beat
Basically, I cannot wait to be free
Of the chains that pain slavery can make me believe
Say cheese, picture illustrated to me
What I'm saying is easy to display cuz I named it the beat
Peace

[Hook]
