I got a thing for nymphos older than seventy. Hold me! Heavenly. Speak in heavenly peace like sleep in Christmas time when I spit my rhymes. OD! Get me, or get with me. Or catch an STD like SSS-ing at a QB. I thought that was wack because I thought of that. And my low self-esteem is the pride of a chick who might have died at the hands of a Six. Wasn’t my hands but I’ll be damned if I did it. Because, damn, that’s some shit. As in the shit I’m in. Not my crib, the opposite. The shit I’m in. Shit, kid. Grown-ass man. Grown men, hopefully she can hold them

The fact you exist is some actual shit. As in, all Sixes should crack your shit. Or, practice living in a way where you would end up getting a date. That would be cool. But, no. Because I’m Charles Hamilton, you slut! So when we fuck, give it up. And I’ll be what’s up in the shit show. Disco 54. You are in my eyes. In my sight, in my mind. I’m in anytime I try to begin. Why can’t you be Mary SEGA? Why can’t you marry SEGA? Why can’t we get married in the name of SEGA,and tell you ex-boyfriend later?

It’s funny. I met you, and you defined manhood. Then you defiled my manhood. Then you tried to beautify my manhood. You defy, you are guy. As in gay. As in upside-down of S-E-G-A. Look, I looked at it a few days ago. And I made this flow. Like, “Thank you, Hov.” Or, fuck you. See, that’s a Two. But, just Two? And then I adjust to the Two who are just this new mood of mine. I’m doing fine. And there are a few more. But none of them seem to come up to you, whore. It must be your swing. It must be something. It must be love between
