Maybe I don't know what everybody knows
But all the things I know could end this fucking globe
Don't play with me
All I ask is don't play with me

It's time that I start revealing some of me, since some of y'all ain't feelin' me this Summer. Maybe it's because I'm still a wonder. Maybe it's because I'm still a runner. Kept it so real before, but niggas ain't feel me. So, some more! And if they must explore, I bust they jaw. Fuck a lot of niggas. Bitches, suck them off. And if they still want it, "What the fuck is it for?!" Niggas is soft 'cause they buckin' at Charles. Nothing but another option. Trying to live with these motherfuckers "poppin'" and "crackin'", in the same bracket as hotness. But I get it in when I spit. Regardless of who's the target. I ain't even gotta be hard, nigga. 'Cause Charles exists. And I am The Sun. Get your lungs up to this

Maybe I don't know what everybody knows
But all the things I know could end this fucking globe
Don't play with me
All I ask is don't play with me

Rumble in the Jungle when a nigga get the heat! I HAD BEEF WITH HOV, BOE AND SHA-LEIK! Couple niggas wanna "beef" in my sleep. That goes for that nigga Drake. In his face. Peace! So it ain't snitching. I'm just living with they('re) indecision in my system. Forget it. I don't need no Ritlin or Haldol. Just go off the top like Calgone. When you see the surface is clean, basically you're working with me. For certain, B(ey). And these niggas is jerks to me. And all the FanHate is hurtin' me! But y'all still showin' love. Just gotta get some dollars. Not a scholarship. I just gotta holla at a white chick for a couple dollars out her purse. Make it work. Make her squirt. Then I'm out of a verse
