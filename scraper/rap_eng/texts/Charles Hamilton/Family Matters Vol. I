I'm either peaceful or too stupid to run. Beautiful to some but honestly my news have been rung. Has been. I'm not a has-been. I happened. And I keep happening, even when rapping. I leave it in the past. Perhaps my Grandma could wipe it off the family table with a napkin. In the least bit unconcerned. Never wishing for her to burn in the Hell we live in today. "But why are we even living today?" some would say. So some become a runaway. And I've become a #1 away from being #1 on any day. And having haters saying "anyway." Let me break it down specifically: only my family gets to me. And they're getting shit that is indeed to deep for niggas to swim in. Therefore, I hope y'all niggas just listen

Y'all be talking that bullshit
My family knows I get down
Y'all be talking that bullshit
But (I don't know)
Why y'all be talking that bullshit?
My family knows I get down
Y'all be talking that bullshit
But I'm finally coming around

I became the bottom line after I became a bottom line in the game. Which is: if you choose a dame you're out of my game. But who was running it then? Who was I blocking? Who was I watching? My suicide option. Wishing that a truer I could step in and look. Because every time I open up my book I see lines, criminal charges. So retarded. Charles is not a narcissist, he's just an artist. I'm just trying to protect my family. Make sure they all safe and rest with plan B. Because my Plan A, through C, through Z, basically means nobody is facing me. It's me to me. My 1 is a 9. But the fact my 1 is a 9 means I'm under a crime. I'm someone needs a 9 because someone's coming from behind. Don't look at me because all I offer is shine

I beat the breaks off my children. You never going to disrespect your pop and y'all niggas better learn start building with the quickness. Yes that's right, I whip them. Take off my belt and they can't say "Listen." Because they need discipline, which is what I have unless you're looking in this damned book. And it was slammed shut because I gave a damned look to my grandma. And she said "Hey, Hamilton, look. I understand you got one last name and you're in this family. But come on, that's game. You want to bag your grandmama or something?" I'm like "You're fronting." Because I'm in a different world, assumption. And that I'm having such has me backing up. So I gotta grab my nuts. MY NUTS. Back off, bitches. Back off game. And Music, I love you. That's all. Game. Goodnight
