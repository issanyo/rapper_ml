[Intro]
Alright, alright, alright, alright
What do I know about, what do I know about the game
That can that can help me leave this fcking house this morning
Alright um, alright, alright, alright uummm
Alright, you have 10 minutes to get to the end of the zone
Alright maybe this is a really bad dream
This is a zone, I'm in a zone
I have 10 minutes to get out of this shit
Alright

I kinda like the phrase "spend some time"
Charles Hamilton

[Verse 1]
Time
We don't speak but can you speed up
Cuz it's getting even harder for people to keep up
I need what a rookie needs we he first enters the game
The ability to chill and still rekindle the flame
I came into the game with
So come visit the same nigga who lifted his spirit
? a kiss from the rain
God rules, she loves me
So I'm lonely when her reign ends
Cuz that just leaves me
What was ea-sy can become unbelievably difficult, you see?
It's a difficult job to be C
But I spit too many letters for this difficult-y
Easy, time is on my side
I never come second I been on my grind
For a minute, separate what's ours
And be lost in the days from the flowers
The music is my power

[Hook]
(2x)
10 minutes StH you're on
A minute later StH and you're gone
So come on-on-on on-on-on on-on-on on-on-on

[Verse 2]
Your time is go time
No time to waste, old time is great past
New time is late future
I just spaz
I'm present in my what the fuck class
Just ask me if you taking too long like Daft Punk
To understand my rap son
Make a wish like 11 past one
You know the urban myths
Look it up if you ain't heard of it
The most absurd wish granted when the times right
So sour is the lime light I'm right
My sight is hind sight
I look at yesterday to prepare for today in a better way
10 minutes in the zone
I'm living in the zone
Infinitely listen to me zone
You can zone for a second and your visiting my home
This where I zone
Shit I'm so alone

[Hook]
(2x)
10 minutes StH you're on
A minute later StH and you're gone
So come on-on-on on-on-on on-on-on on-on-on

(clears throat)
Lemme get in the right zone

[Verse 3]
Time is money when you got a lot of it
I love it I am not budging
Twice as negative
I am not nothing
Why do I does this?
Mind if I crush this?

[Bridge]
Look out I'm going in
Look out, look out I'm going in
I'm going in, I'm going in
Look out I'm going in
I can't lose for nothing
I ain't losing nothing
I can't lose for nothing, lose for nothing
I ain't losing nothing
I can't stop I ain't giving up
No I can't stop I ain't giving up
I ain't giving up, I ain't giving up
I can't stop I ain't giving up

[Hook]
(2x)
10 minutes StH you're on
A minute later StH and you're gone
So come on-on-on on-on-on on-on-on on-on-on

[Outro]
You only got 10 minutes to get to the end
That's what the game thought me haha

Ain't no body running the zone like me hehe
