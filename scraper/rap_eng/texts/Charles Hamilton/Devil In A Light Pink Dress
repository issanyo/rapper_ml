[Intro]
Uhh, I see you. Uhhh, you wanna do it right here? (Heh)
I ain't ever did it here before, uhh uhh
Charles something, ya know?

[Verse 1]
She's the devil in a light pink dress
She giving me the eye like I might be next
She already know I got a wifey, yes
But she don't really care, cause tonight she's stressed
She needs a release, and I be best
She said "You wanna leave?" and I'm like "Please yes!"
We can just do it in my Nike Checks
You think I mean sneakers, I mean sex
I might be vex, if my girl find out
But how in the hell will my girl find out?
"Whatcha wanna do?" I'm like "Girl find out"
I'll be damned if the girl find out
So my sex game. I lit the bong cause I'm shaky with my text game
And she said she wanna ride it like the X Games
But I aim with the games baby, let's play
I'm trying to get up inside you like an x-ray

[Hook]
We'll go harder. You know I do it better
The rain falls harder, but I can get you wetter
Her brain's getting smarter, I might as well let her
The midnight fire starter, the only way to sweat it. (Sweat it)

[Verse 2]
Lemme give you what I got
I got a lot to give, and you're begging for a lot
I'm begging for a taste, and you begging for the rock
We sound like fiens so this better hit the spot
Is your boyfriend better than me? Not!
I got you dripping sweat, he could never get you hot
I'm clever; am I not? You got to know
You gotta be a virgin not to know
Lemme tell you something baby, no obstacles
Thrown in between us, couldn't stop the flow
The bed is the stage and I rock the show
I set it off quick, and I stop it slow. (Uhh)
I do everything possible to convince your pretty ass not to go. (Uhhh)
But if you say you 'bout to go. Lemme give you a parting gift, Let's rock some more. (Uhh)

[Hook]
We'll go harder. You know I do it better
The rain falls harder, but I can get you wetter
Her brain's getting smarter, I might as well let her
The midnight fire starter, the only way to sweat it. (Sweat it)

She can take it
She can take it
She can take it
She can take it
She can take it
She can take it
She can take it
She can take it

[Hook]
We'll go harder. You know I do it better
The rain falls harder, but I can get you wetter
Her brain's getting smarter, I might as well let her
The midnight fire starter, the only way to sweat it. (Sweat it)

She can take it
She can take it
She can take it
She can take it
She can take it
She can take it
She can take it
She can take it
