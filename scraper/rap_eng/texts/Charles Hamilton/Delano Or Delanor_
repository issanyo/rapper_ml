Verse 1:

To my nigga LB where the loud at?
To my nigga named Bo where the crowd at?
To my nigga Dre tell me where the proud at?
They not proud a me, but im loud as can be
So I hit my nigga LB like where the loud at?
I hit Bo like the crowd act wack
And the crowd saying act like that, they all aliens
So i'm feeling like spraying them
I am the opposite of love but i'm love that's fucked up
Gotta' get some love for the love that's fucked up
I could be the love that's fucked up
But I am the love and i'm fucked up
A big mirror; looking into it
Like i'm too intimate, to be your best friend
But i'm in some shit, help me out
My hand from the bottom reaching up
And your hands are like "I got em" what the fuck?

Chorus:

X3 Ain't no mystery I live in the city

Out of town clowns get down I got em

Verse 2:

Shout out to Hex Murda take my life
But i'm NYC you better make it right
As soon as I step out my neighborhood
They like yo " We'll die in this hood for you Charles"
You off your rocker, you should lose it
And tell niggas that it's far from just music
But as far as I could see I could die now
Right now as soon as I lie down
I lay on the altar, don't cross the-
One that would die on The Rock of Gibraltar
Just for the survival of my others
I am not trying to be some dying motherfucka
Let me come back in the resurrection
In the middle of it, just to intercept somebody's midsection
Rip it off like Johnny Cage, i'm the rage like Carson

Chorus:

Verse 3:

Ayo my death comes from a bad bitch
Who promises I can cum on her wig and get mad riches
Some honest shit, momma be proud a me
Because i'm the one who's as loud as could be
So Shout to my nigga LB where the loud at?
Shout out my nigga Bo, tell me where the crowd at?
And Dre tell me all the proud facts, what I got now?
Must a nigga dropped down I am not on a cloud
I'm feeling like rain, niggas only dance when they feeling my name
Not because of the substance these niggas like-
"Fuck it this Charles saying shit that's hard and it's a bar"
On subject: acknowledge me
The fact is I owe life an apology
I'm sorry SEGA, sorry New York, sorry everybody
But everybody can be bodied by my shotty

Chorus:
