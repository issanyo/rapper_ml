[Intro: Charles Hamilton]
Greetings, sit down. How you feeling this evening?
Good, as long as you didn't say, "grieving"
If that made you laugh, don't think about leaving
There'll be no more talks about skeeting
Very few drug references, no heating, no peeing, no repeating
Gotta keep it hot. Won't be no deleting
I'm trying to keep my eyes dry while I'm reading
The last female who I was seeing
Pretty much wasn't for the keeping
But she had all my music straight from the key ring
My heart, body, and soul; what a beating
I'm rebuilding, she's chilling
But she's in possession of deep feelings
Love isn't enough. Death is too much
But with it comes love and trust

[Hook: Charles Hamilton]
I would wake up all because of her
Lay down to the thought of her
Only leave the house for her
Now my fire is doused because of her
Never had a nightmare until her
Now my only nightmare is her
But I will be fine without her
I just wish my bottom line was not her

[Verse One: Charles Hamilton]
I'm hurting
I admit I was why our thing wasn't working
She would go online and see traces of me flirting
Naked pictures and comments of other girls smirking
I'm sure she thought the love chain, I was jerking
But it was for her, every beat I was murking
Even when I felt the love reaper out lurking
All love is forever is the thing I was certain
About no matter what thought was occurring
Every time I saw her my soul would start stirring
I could feel during, I had her kitty purring
Nowadays I'm careful about my wording
Still the same fury, but with less worry
No more of a hurry, just not as dirty
Look, I'm almost thirty
So even if I didn't give my beats and sentences
As a "please don't leave me in the wind"
She needed to be a friend

[Hook]

[Bridge]
I feel soulless without you
You were my Her
Mind, heal, soul, and now you
There are no words
Tell me how can I feel better without you
What happened to her?
So I wrote this letter about you
I hope you heard
Shit

[Hook]
