[Intro]
I just... I just ate a cap, mostly all the rows and J's and doing you
Know lines and chasing the white rabbit. I'm capping off! Hahaha...
Aww yeah, *DJ Scratch*, Aww yeah...
I love you you Sonic
Sonic I love you...
(Uh, uh)

[Verse 1]
Produced and licenced by, now let me run
Baby let me get inside, let me cum
Number one with your sexy ass dress
I'm deadly when I run...
Off at the mouth, off goes your blouse
Off goes everything I'm talking about
Cause I go off with everything I'm talking about
And there's no thought with everything I'm talking about
Simply giving y'all my thoughts in this talk
Fine, I'm the boss, and the guy who's often running around
Now, take off everything you got on
And let me go off in your mouth
Lust, with a little bit of trust
Smoking on a little dust
I heard high has a crush on me

[Hook]
I need to top my kicks
I'm on a bonafide mushroom trip
I'm on a bonafide mushroom trip
I'm on a bonafide mushroom trip

I don't know what this is
I'm on a bonafide mushroom trip
I'm on a bonafide mushroom trip
I'm on a bonafide mushroom trip

MUSHROOMS AND WAR!
MUSHROOMS AND WAR!
MUSHROOMS AND WAR!
MUSHROOMS AND WAR!

[Verse 2]
I love pussy, no doubt
I call it the voiceless mouse
I mean mouth, you don't like it, get O-W-T, out
Remember the cartoon, yeah, Cupid motherfucker aiming for your heart
With a harpoon, like "Harpo, don't you touch me motherfucker"
Y'all soon understand, The Color Purple, what I roll up
Now all I'm seeing is fucking purple
Oh my god, my high is simply reminding me why
I don't need to be walking the street unless I walk to a beat
Jamaican flow, how often can I be
So off from the trees

[Hook]
I need to top my kicks
I'm on a bonafide mushroom trip
I'm on a bonafide mushroom trip
I'm on a bonafide mushroom trip

I don't know what this is
I'm on a bonafide mushroom trip
I'm on a bonafide mushroom trip
I'm on a bonafide mushroom trip

MUSHROOMS AND WAR!
MUSHROOMS AND WAR!
MUSHROOMS AND WAR!
MUSHROOMS AND WAR!

[Outro]
What's wrong with me?
I don't know, but as long as this beat is reminding me I had a long skeet
I'm gonna kick its ass, light a bong, and go to sleep
I actually forgot what I was gonna say on this part of the song, so O.D
By the way, my girlfriend is bad like those them girls in exploited black teens
We do nasty things nightly, at least psychically, over the phone
Please don't break up with me, cause I would do absolutely nothing
Just be heartbroken, and dusty
Fuck it, fuck it, fuck it!
1, 2, 3, 4, and I'm kicking the bucket

[Hook]
I need to top my kicks
I'm on a bonafide mushroom trip
I'm on a bonafide mushroom trip
I'm on a bonafide mushroom trip

I don't know what this is
I'm on a bonafide mushroom trip
I'm on a bonafide mushroom trip
I'm on a bonafide mushroom trip

MUSHROOMS AND WAR!
MUSHROOMS AND WAR!
MUSHROOMS AND WAR!
MUSHROOMS AND WAR!
