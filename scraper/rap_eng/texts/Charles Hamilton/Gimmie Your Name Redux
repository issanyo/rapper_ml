[Verse 1: Inferno]

Back in 9th grade, me and women never clicked
Now I get em open like a nigga set a pick
And even when I can't, I don't give a letter six
I just find a better chick, INF will never quit
I lay sick game, but my eyes are fine
Like I was triple H, I like em china fine
So when I saw you with your wide behind
You know I got in front of every guy in line
And every dime in mine just got they card declined
Cuz a girl who's off the wall? Those are hard to find
We ain't gotta be together from sunrise to 9
Just let me get a little time like a minor crime
Then we could stop by my address and undress
I got a some issues, with you I'd have one less
So we gone sip a 40 oz to this
And listen to the homie Brizzy, he about to spit

[Verse 2: Brizzy]

Drop dead gorgeous but her name ain't lucy
An addict I need more of it she do something to me
Average as adequate chill nigga not having it
Gotta be a 10 or my decision is adamant
She keep me up n at'em that's why I call her atom ant
Man it's something about her, she thick like chowder
And the way she treats my schnitzel let's me know she a rider
Late nights early morning never getting any sleep
Why even worry when my dream is laying next to me
Damn she so bad that the cops wanna cuff her g
Presence is a luxury when she drop it low like bucket
Get more attention than the screens of computer geeks
Lips so soft in stores she would compete with peep
Chivalry is dead so fresh from the grave it's me
Chocolate and savory ur personal savior see
And enjoy the wonders of the boy
And if u ever feel caged seek me for release


[Verse 3: Inferno]

You no regular chick, facts, never forget that
When I saw you I needed medical dispatch
Because I passed out, but your incredible hips that
Was all it really took to end of the rest of my quick nap
We could get together split the rest of a six pack
And watch the sunset, it's a blessing to kick back
You need a man to treat you like a feather in his cap
I know you heard it all, we can sever the chit chat
This ain't a love song, it's a like song
Said I'd take a shot, now I finally got my sights on
If we were together you could get your Big Syke on
Eyes on you, I would treat you like an icon
I heard that you left your bae, like Mark Jackson
My mind said shut my mouth, my heart's asking
Money is time, relations are taxing
But I know you feeling me, let's stop acting
