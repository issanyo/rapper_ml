[Intro]

[Verse 1: Mickey Factz]
Press start, now I'm inside of the game
Eyes full of rage, voice sayin', "Rise from the grave,"
Pixelated grass, bricks full of power ups
Hopin' one to steal, I hit it to bring a flower up
Runnin' shoes from Sonic lookin' for Robotnik
My sidepiece Samus is actin' like I'm a novice
My hands are like E. Honda's, the monsters lookin' like Blanka
Fantasy for a fantasy trynna bag Kitana
But she guarded by Baraka
My cheat code symbolic
If I die, 29 more lives, I work for Contra
But they the ones supplyin' the crack
Some moves like a ghost when you buyin' a pack
Man... but back to my mission before the world fail
Megaman gun wit' a leaf that get a squirrel tail
Bronx kid, F1-Zero from Nintendo
Can't wait 'til I hit the X again like King Hippo, I'm trapped...

[Hook: Nikki Jean]
We stay up up down down left right left right B A
Baby, it's not fair, they can't follow, don't know the code
We stay up up down down left right left right B A
Baby, it's not fair, they can't follow, don't know the code
Don't know the code

[Verse 2: Charles Hamilton]
I'm fuckin' bored, I don't wanna do this anymore
To be truthful, music has been losin' from the door
But I move forward, doin' more than I'm sure I should
I'm sure I'm good, but I'm Pure and from the hood
Snorin' when I could to my 8-bit symphony
I got enemies, one bar of energy
A bunch of legs to stand on like playin' Centipede
CPU, it's just them and me
I have a different team, it's just interestin' to talk about
Cause I don't see them everywhere I walk around
Profound thoughts comin' off the ground
No bullies talkin' down
Just invadin' a boss's town
No death, no air bubbles, just coughin' rounds
Awesome clouds and awkward clowns all surround
You don't get it, but I factored it in
This is an 8-bit dream, I don't have to fit in, ungh

[Hook: Nikki Jean]
We stay up up down down left right left right B A
Baby, it's not fair, they can't follow, don't know the code
We stay up up down down left right left right B A
Baby, it's not fair, they can't follow, don't know the code
Don't know the code
Don't know the code

[Verse 3: Mickey Factz]
Had to pause the game, with Bomberman, we blowin' up
You know wassup, Raccoon City got zombies showin' up
Eatin' whole turkeys with Axel walkin' through Streets of Rage
Be amazed, ran into Splinter leavin' a pizza place
Robotnik teamin' with Bowser, that is as trouble as a game that's inside of a game
Sonic and Knuckles see, through the scope with Goldeneyes of gold marksmen
Feelin' just like Link with this gold cartridge
He's on fire, left â€˜em toasty like Ed Boon
Midway through half of the stage, I get a flesh wound
[?] to riddle me fatal and then a halo will appear
Then I'm side by side judge with Kratos
Hand me a star, now I'm invincible
Quarters runnin' low, so typical when I'm gettin' through
I got my mojo back against my nemesis on Genesis
X-men stage, gotta reset this shit
