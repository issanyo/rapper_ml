Shawty, you playing with me. Looking at your body when you’re laying with me. I don’t hear what you’re saying to me. Pause. I ain’t trying to be playing make-believe. I want you to make me believe that I could never make you leave when I make love to thee. Wake up, it’s just you and me. We just do what we must do, usually. Which is make love and put up with the bullshit from the world outside of the pulpit. In the bedroom, microphone is the pulpit. Life, I got it, not trying to stop it. Bite the mics from Mars when I don’t write the bars. Kinda cool, kinda short but all the time I’m Charles. Which is kinda awesome. Time to floss

Girl, I hope you’re ready. I’ve been waiting
Girl, I hope you’re ready. Are we dating? Hold up
Are we serious? Yeah, darling, are we serious?
Tell me, Darling

I think I need you now. Shit, I think I need to bow. A nigga gotta laugh. I’m using way too many words inside the class. I raised my hand to grab the teacher's breast. She confessed she needs this sin. Reason, once again, I'm breathing is because I like jumping in. The fat kid from Sandlot or Dope Pool. No reason to go through what I go through. I don’t like being compared to Goku. Supersonic! Supersonic! Supersonic! To be honest, I'm a rule about it. Not a lot of fools are rotten and jotting what I've gotten. And niggas can't fuck with me at all, Darling. So it’s you and I until the day I commit suicide

Girl, I hope you’re ready. I’ve been waiting
Girl, I hope you’re ready. Are we dating? Hold up
Are we serious? Yeah, darling, are we serious?
Tell me, Darling

Shawty, you playing with me. Taking a breath from me. I say that it’s ecstasy. Baby, you better believe every day I think about making some cheese to get with thee. I say thee instead of you. Olde English, it's The Incredible Olde English, what I call my flow. John Nintendo flow, oh! So dope when I roll on a track like this. Oh no! Don't' tell me Hov tried to crack his fist and crack my jaw. Because that nigga's taller than Asher Roth. And that cat hit me with a couple of lines that I didn't appreciate. So, fuck him sometimes! Ladies, get at all the chicks that was on the XXL cover sometimes

Girl, I hope you’re ready. I’ve been waiting
Girl, I hope you’re ready. Are we dating? Hold up
Are we serious? Yeah, darling, are we serious?
Tell me, Darling
