[Intro: Homeboy Sandman]
Yo, if you scared, get a dog, yo
Get a strong, like a, like a Rottweiler or a Boxer dog
Not a Pomeranian dog

[Verse 1: Homeboy Sandman]
Rather than whine and bitch in the war zone
It's Aes, I, and the Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe
I be just trying to warn folks
Sun be going nut, whole lower torso in your horoscope
Gimme a break, I'll be walking dead, gimme a base
Watch for walking dead eating your brains
I repped the struggle despite the subtle taste of cod
Boy sand, in the place to be, by the grace of God!

[Verse 2: Aesop Rock]
I step in the arena bumping Step in the Arena
Green wayfarers, no gray hair, it's a patina
Don't play fair, you could tell by how he share his pizza
The 60/40 special from a porky Ebeneezer
Reppin’ La Isla Bonita, brace for the brain rot
Four eyes, corners like a marble in a maze box
Set your phasers, obey or catch the vapors
My 1,2, unscrew a player from his trainers

[Hook: Homeboy Sandman & (Aesop Rock)]
So it appears we do not get along (Say what?)
So back up off or get involved (Say what?)
And if you scared, get a dog
So it appears we do not get along (Say what?)
So back up off or get involved (Say what?)
And if you scared, get a dog

[Sample]
Shut up when I'm talkin' to you

[Verse 3: Aesop Rock]
Yapple Dapple, rappers like crabs in a barrel
Get trapped and blanched and snap crackled
I’m Ginsberg interning at the Magic Castle
I’m Bob Ross, happy accidents and rad afro
Back and a tad wacko in laughably bad graphics
The class act travel in batches of Mad Max’s
And savages who still haven’t changed out of their pajamas
Luckily I never show up on your cameras, It’s bananas

[Verse 4: Homeboy Sandman]
I sit and meditate until the answer come
Sand is back and teaching rappers how to spell chrysanthemum
From holding hands wit cats that barely know the half
I barely even knew the half of em
But keep the valentine's day homecourt
Sonic catcalls from the steps, Jah bless
Bacon and eggs for cooler heads, hedging my bets
Force of habit had me almost care
But I nipped it in the bud, and now I'm almost there

[Hook: Homeboy Sandman & (Aesop Rock)]
So it appears we do not get along (Say what?)
So back up off or get involved (Say what?)
And if you scared, get a dog
So it appears we do not get along (Say what?)
So back up off or get involved (Say what?)
And if you scared, get a dog

[Sample]
Shut up when I'm talkin' to you

[Verse 5: Homeboy Sandman]
Great Scott, good gracious, and oh no
Hi def, all close ups and slow mo
My skin is amber like a ripened bud
My adversaries tryna spill my capillaries full of viking blood
I seldom like what they be hyping up
So people wanna fight then tell me lighten up
What? I'm just tryna enlighten 'em
Beyond "Yo, I just didn't think it's slammin'"
My t-shirt isn't pink, it's salmon

[Verse 6: Aesop Rock]
Old school, new school, no school
These bass lines ain't raise no fool
Aes AWOL outta homeroom
Heads up, show up in the throne room
Hoping for a breadcrumb, throw up in the show room
Wait show ‘em how the rogue do
March to his own with the clone-proof
Songbirds perched on my finger at the window
Admittedly the rest of my life is a fucking shit-show

[Hook: Homeboy Sandman & (Aesop Rock)]
So it appears we do not get along (Say what?)
So back up off or get involved (Say what?)
And if you scared, get a dog
So it appears we do not get along (Say what?)
So back up off or get involved (Say what?)
And if you scared, get a dog

[Sample]
Shut up when I'm talkin' to you

[Outro]
Yo, get a... get a--get a wolf--get a Husky that looks like a wolf
Get a Iditar- you know the dogs that run the Iditarod
Get a dog from the Iditarod
Which is supposed to be a... a tough dog
