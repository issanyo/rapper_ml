Ma, you raised me Christian. That's why today I'm in a crazy position. May I lay with ladies who listen. Or may I be raised to see the God that we have served ever since I got on Jesus' nerves by being the Son. We are like one and the same. This is poetry so there's no gun to your frame even though you say some things that you need to explain. Look, Ma, I'm not gay - I WAS RAPED AND YOU KNEW IT. And you had to spew it back in the day. It broke my heart, but it made me chill with every lady in a passionate way. But you always say it's like I'M covering something up?! What the fuck? Your assumptions suck. I hate you, but I love you so much. Mother, grow up. Enough of those stuffs

My mom is more today than yesterday
We were at war in days of yesterday
But Mama I love you more today than yesterday
And not as much as tomorrow...

When I would cut up in class my Mom would fuck up my rhyme book. So it's hard to say fuck the past. Tear out every rhyme, even rhymes about her. Now when I rhyme about her I think about the time I was her in the mind of every student. Damn I'm a mutant. Professor X, deadly movement. When it comes to hugging my mother I might want to snuff her. I don't give a fuck if she listens to this song because when she had that other motherfucker move in. I had to move my girl in to make that world end. I thought I was her boy and she was my girlfriend? She told me I was her first love. I told her she was the only girl. That birth stuff? Really meant nothing. Plus I got a past life. She ain't really bother me, not even last night. But...

My mom is supposedly Yancey. That's not something I can OD fancy. Damn, B! You mean to tell me you're supposed to be my best friend? And yet my past is your favorite weapon? That sucks! So if you are Nicki, I can never climax.  And don't question. We can never be close. We'll foverevr be closer. I'm a celebrity, yo. I will never be effing with those hoes. I just want a bad bitch, Mother. I don't want to act like a savage, Mother. I jsut want to die, you can have this shit Mother. Have all those covers I was jacking off on when you stormed in the room. This is an off song. This is an awful song, man. All of it's wrong. I love my mother but she hates me. I'm crazy. She loves me but I DON'T LOVE NO MOTHERFUCKER

My mom is more today than yesterday
(BECAUSE OF YOU!)
We were at war in days of yesterday
(IT'S ALL YOUR FAULT!)
But Mama, I love you more today than yesterday
And not as much as tomorrow...
