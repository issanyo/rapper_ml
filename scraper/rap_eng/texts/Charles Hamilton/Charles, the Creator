When the clock strike 12:00 on the nose, you got to know the distance between the hour the minute and second. I devour these minutes from these ministers send a message to niggas thinking reckless. But I take my time to do it, so when it’s 12:01 you gotta be a shining God to understand my rhyme and movement. I shine like a diamond and you prove it. You need a chain. Speak your name. I don’t need a thang, I eat the game
So as the second hand moves, the distance isn’t missed. Because with a quick tick everything follows 60 of em then everything gets swallowed from the previous minute. So as time goes by, I’m eating the minute. Thinking for minutes, hours of time. Gotta be my time to shine

Everyone’s all grown up
I don’t care what you do
But nobody want to show up
I don’t care what you do
So it’s safe to say
I don’t care what you do
I don’t care
As time floats by in spite of you

I applaud all of you kids for holing onto your dreams but Marilyn Manson said it - We are disposable teens. So anything you seen in a magazine while you’re flowing through with your fingers hoping to see your favorite article on your favorite artist. You outta know it’s some overly smart shit, really some dumb shit, honestly some hard shit. But a broken heart’s the target. You gotta use your smart sense to not argue with niggas who are only winning via arguments. I’m trying to give wisdom. Hopefully these kids listen. Because as the big ticking continues, you’re getting older. And this boulder on my shoulder is getting colder
The Evil Microchip, I downloaded it. So I hold it for a moment or 6, just flowing

Everyone’s all grown up
I don’t care what you do
But nobody want to show up
I don’t care what you do
So it’s safe to say
I don’t care what you do
I don’t care
As time floats by in spite of you

Make the most of your time. Even If I don’t flow but I rhyme I take my time to share. So how dare you say I don’t care? Even if it’s from a pair eyes over there. In Egypt there’s a big deception, perhaps a misconception, or misdirected hit from a missile sent to my chest from cupid. I know these drums are stupid but I’m trying to avoid it with my strongest ability just to let the song know I’m feeling me. You can’t have me I’m taking my time to build me. All you can do is steal me. But you can share me, be the opposite of these people who clearly just want to see me pop some shit or get some riches in my pocket. I’d rather be gothic. I got this

Everyone’s all grown up
I don’t care what you do
But nobody want to show up
I don’t care what you do
So it’s safe to say
I don’t care what you do
I don’t care
