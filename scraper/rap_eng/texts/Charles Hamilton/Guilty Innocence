I spent countless hours and nights bouncing on grooves. Amounting to the Mountain Dew that all kinds of cowards and dykes would sip to be as nice as this. Get energized! Feel alive, while I penetrate in your mind. Demonstration, better than conversation when alive. But then, it could end your life when you demonstrate how you could get down. Music, it's time for me to move in the town and shake everything around. So swing around. Listen to the 9th track. Baby, I'll be right back. Like this... no, I didn't have to write this shit

I'm sick and tired of having to prove my love to you
I'm spitting fire. My bad, I just rule the world for you
On this microphone

I go deeper than the cotton of a kick drum. Stop it (if you don't wanna listen)! I'm on a quest to get snares. Drumming in my hair. But not to keep me under. Just to get to the underwear. Let me grow my 'fro out again... There. It's just how I feel. Trying to be deep got me Ally McBeal. I don't eat, but I know the law. I know what it is with the Holy Cross. I turned it upside-down to make God show off Her lipgloss and give me a kiss while I talk. Make it French. You made French people. Unless you made ancient people... but then again, ancient people have ancient evil. And that's why I speak so great, miss
