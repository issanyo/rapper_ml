[Intro]
Yea man this should be great
It's Charles Hamilton
Jockin CH
Jockin CH
Jock jockin CH
Jockin
I just like how that shit sound, my fault

[Verse 1]
Bling bling it's some StH thing
Yes he makes cream
But blessed to make beats
And step with great feet
To stretch the pavement
In a special way, please
Yes you may breathe
That was the message left from A. Keys
"You Don't Know My Name," but let me explain, geez
A whole verse can't catch your attention?
Now watch me come back with a sentence
That will actually mention why I'm rapping
Sadistic is the rapping
But lets get to the matter
Gold objects give me powers
I do in five minutes
What takes you 50 hours
I think I deserve a little bling
Not your little bling, but a pure little thing called a Grammy
Is that too much to ask?
The winner is...
Why ask, what's up with that?

[Hook]
(Over "Single Ladies" chorus)
I make dope shit
There he go quick
So Grammy committee
Come put a ring on it
It was always my dream
Nah mean
All I want you to do is
Put a ring on it
Since I liked it well I'm gonna
Put a ring on it
Since I liked it well I'm gonna
Put a ring on it
Don't get mad if you see that she want it
Cause I'mma get her if you didn't
Put a ring on it

[Verse 2]
My fault Hov
That's wifey and all
But on the mic I don't fall
Who's nicer than Charles?
Name a rapper
I'mma entertainer thought
Rip his facial off
Make the shit a paper ball
Put some drums behind it
And I can have you sittin for a month
In silence
Come and find him, stylin
But my punches are harder
Come at a smarter
Off the top
I be stuntin on barbers
So get your wig push
Back bang ya head
My name has been said
Charles Hamilton, lay in ya bed
Say I'm the best
And you'll be savin your rest
I don't play with the vets
I know the names of the reps
This game is a mess
So I'm takin over last letter in sonic
First in hedgehog
Rappin livin honestly
Most of you dead dogs
Is just mini dogs
And I'mma Hamilton
Did my point get across?

[Hook]
(Over "Single Ladies" chorus)
I make dope shit
There he go quick
So Grammy committee
Come put a ring on it
It was always my dream
Nah mean
All I want you to do is
Put a ring on it
Since I liked it well I'm gonna
Put a ring on it
Since I liked it well I'm gonna
Put a ring on it
Don't get mad if you see that she want it
Cause I'mma get her if you didn't
Put a ring on it

[Verse 3]
And it don't stop til' I press power
Not even death could devour
Where I rest cause I'm louder
I really don't rest and/or shower
But I step with the power
And my breakfast is vowels
Lunch is nouns
For dinner I'm munching down
A bunch of clowns
Who wants it now
I can't help it
It was nothing new in school
Publicly a fool it sucks to be this cool

[Hook]
(Over "Single Ladies" chorus)
I make dope shit
There he go quick
So Grammy committee
Come put a ring on it
It was always my dream
Nah mean
All I want you to do is
Put a ring on it
Since I liked it well I'm gonna
Put a ring on it
Since I liked it well I'm gonna
Put a ring on it
Don't get mad if you see that she want it
Cause I'mma get her if you didn't
Put a ring on it

[Outro]
Charles Hamilton
