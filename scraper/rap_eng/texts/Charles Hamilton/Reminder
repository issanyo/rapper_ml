[Intro]
If I should die after recording this song
I want the world to know that I always loved God

[Verse 1]
Angels on my side
Demons in my eyes
Screaming through my rhymes
Breathing in my mind, keeping me awake
Sleepy all the time
Weakened by the lies
Evil intertwined, with people in my life
Leaving me to find
A piece of peace of mind
But frequently I cry, "Please just let me die"
"Hcho is a liar, That nigga ain't your brother"
"Halo is a faker, just like all the others"
Who can I run to, feeling so smothered
"Nobody loves you, not even your own mother"
The ink from the pen, leaks in my skin
The pink that's within, has reached the stitches end
I think full of sin, I think this is it
Please let me live, and sleep once again
But everytime I sleep, I gotta wonder
"Does the grim reaper have my number?"

[Hook x2]
I'm bored of both heaven and hell
(Sometimes I think the devil needs reminding)
Some people never can tell
So I show em', tears from a dead man's poem

[Verse 2]
Cigarette smoke
Giving less hope
Isn't death close?
Nigga, yes or no?
There is no maybe
So, lately, I start to go crazy like a 2 year old baby
Life's a radio station that just won't play me
No clean versions, just obscene verses
I kissed the witch doctor
So, I've seen curses
Schizophrenic liver split between 3 persons
I'm everybody's little brother
"Come on, Charles. You'll get over it and put it in a song, Charles."
But, do you mother fuckers know what it feels like
To have your best work be true stories from your real life?
You probably think the drug talk is metaphorical
Little do you know I probably done more than you
I only sobered up cause I can't fuckin' afford it
But, believe I'd be a junkie if heroine was affordable
I'm high on life, cause there ain't much more to do
But, life's buzz is a light buzz
There's gotta be more to do
I write with a needle, my songs are a hit
So overdose till you no longer exist
So long to your grip
Lose it

[Bridge]
Sometimes I think the devil needs reminding

[Verse 3]
The day that I was born, another man died
The Hamiltons smiled, another fam cried
I attempted suicide, enough damn times
To know that man's ghost haunts me
And I fucking can't die
You love my damn mind
When I break into new zones
But, my music, my grave, and my tombstone
You feel the rage and the pain and it's too close
The kids getting raped when they're raised in a group home
Where is the loyalty? Where is the comradery?
Based on the prophecy, I gotta be the chosen one
In the land of the frozen sun
And that's a hole in one
No cough. No walkin'. No talk
No death. No coffin. No offin'
Fuck

[Hook x2]

[Outro]
During chorus and after
I think it's just me sometimes
I swear to God, I think it's just me sometimes
Y'all don't see the shit I see in my head
You don't feel the shit I feel in my songs
I swear to God, if y'all did, maybe y'all would fucking get it
JUST LEAVE ME ALONE!
Just go away
Just go away
I just want it all to stop
Just go away
