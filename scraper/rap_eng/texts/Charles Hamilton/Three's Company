Your knees are gonna knock right here
Your knees are gonna knock right here
Your knees are gonna knock right here

I had a six I was scared to drop
And now I have a clip that I’m scared to watch
But I dare you to watch

Niggas claim they’re family, but they’re banging hammers at each nigga you would be claiming. See, I was from the streets, where niggas will be slanging when they really want to speak proper english. The Doctor of English. In Harlem there was another doctor Dre. Love for Ed was the other way. And I’m a straight lover. Straight bugged out when under the covers. First masturbated to Lil’ Kim. Wanted to get locked up to understand a little bit. Matter of fact, I’ve been this criminal minded. No subliminals in my shit. I was not out slanging, I was out figuring out slang and then saying it

And now I have a clip that I’m scared to watch

You know the flow. 139th, I would go home in the future. 124th and Broadway I was used to. But I walked from 124th to 139th one day, with a dog on a chain. Not used to barking from them pit bulls, except Nike. Nike was on the street I would be on, 124th and Broadway. 1-Train banging, sounding like this track. Hanging around, no Carpenters, just perfect with words when walking. Wanted to see if the curb I would walk my dog on, was as hard as them dogs on Lennox. Listening to Big L, trying to get wealthy

I wasn’t born in the big city, but I got raised there. Sometimes I think I should have stayed there. But nights ain’t play fair. Then again the niggas that don’t play fair don’t stay there. They know the game that I don’t play. And my story is like OJ. It would take a Jay to Z me. And if you know the game, you can’t delete me. Speaking easy on a speakeasy, like a Sunday.  I don’t preach, but these beats preach to me and I will preach about it one day. Niggas gonna learn how to rap when then hear me rap. I burn up a sack. Speak out facts. Read out facts like machines, beat on machines like tracks. Open up minds. And if they’re all criminal, fine. I still redefine when I rhyme, Read my rhymes when I write them down
