Chris Elston, Chris Smith. I did it for myself, not the business. Feeling selfish, saying a prayer, like “Six... Help them.” If I smash one while a Six is inside, then maybe I can get my life back. Either that, or I die inside and out. I stand out like them. They stand out with the wind. I am who they doubt, I doubt them. I don’t want to do it again, I’m out. But one of them is a Six, the other one is a Six. 12 when I’m inside. 12 for Elston and Smith. Help them, or else this is it

If it wasn’t a sin
I still would t do it again
I did it to go against Him
And then I found Him within
My God. Where are you, where are we? I’m sorry
What wouldn’t do to be in front of you and taste your Grace

God made men attractive somehow. And I’m into magick, run now. I don’t want to wonder how. I don’t want to know shit. I just want to focus. So I roll the sweets like I’m no Six. Hopefully a Six will notice. PAC ME! I got shot by some other bitch trying to shock she. Or some bitch nigga, trying to copy. Regardless, somebody shot me. It shocks me, to this day I’m trying to figure out my situation. Who am I sounding like then? Around for the sound byte, my friend. I think he’s a faggot too. I just want to be Sonic, word to the blue in attitude

My mother died not liking homosexuality, so anybody who is next to battle me faces her fate. But all these niggas is faggots so I might just make it today. Shame on women hopping in men. Trying to start a problem then. It’s obvious to them I’m confused, but not because of my shoes. Thanks a lot, Scoots. Jane Smith, whatever your name is, Pritchett. My life ain’t bitching just because of these bitches, I just want y’all to listen while I die. Suicide is calling me. My darling, please let me die. I don’t need to be alive. Until I look you in your eyes
