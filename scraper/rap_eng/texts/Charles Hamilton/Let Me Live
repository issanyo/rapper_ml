[Verse 1: Charles Hamilton]
It's a beautiful day in my neighbohood
Feeling good man, I never felt greater
Of course everyday starts off with me praising
The lord is my savior
I hardly feel danger
I spark up some haze
Then I'm out my apartment B later
Ran into a classmate, shorty was bangin'
She said she's in college, she's a pharmacy major
You know I play piano, so my charm is C-Major
I said, "Baby, you don't know how long I've been waitin'
To make ya, hotter than a Farm in Jamaica"
(Ya don't know)
So come go, with the one-man fun show
One stroke'll make ya cum slow
Want mo'?
She said, "You were so modest in school"
I said, "Cause I was just a novice in school"
I'm a boss
I ain't gotta follow them rules
So baby come with me, you can't follow them too

[Chorus]
I'm high off life, fuck it I'm wasted, and
I don't wanna get sober
They say you only have fun when you're young, well
I don't wanna get older
Cause this is that type of feeling that
I don't wanna get over
So let me live (x8)

[Verse 2: Bagdad]
I'm feeling good, life is like a movie
I feel like Denzel Washington in a Spike Lee movie
Never been better, new day, new cheddar
New jeans, Purple Labeled cashmere sweater
I feel fantastic
Everyday the fans askin'
"B/A what's happenin'? You still rappin'?"
I'm still rappin'
I get on tracks and I'm still blackin'
Kill rappers
MGM is the king, tower if ya chill braxton
I'm a certified predator
I'll do all the dirty work, Charles is my editor
Holla'd at this girl, she kept walking
I ran up ahead a her
Told her straight up, baby there is no competitor (no one like me)
MGM my family, Demevolist my representer
Told me if I she ever disrespect, I'm out behead a her
Find somebody else to kick it with instead a her
I feel good, great, (you know) etcetera, etcetera

[Chorus]
I'm high off life, fuck it I'm wasted, and
I don't wanna get sober
They say you only have fun when you're young, well
I don't wanna get older
Cause this is that type of feeling that
I don't wanna get over
So let me live (x8)

[Verse 3: Charles Hamilton & Bagdad]
I done been through the games, I deal without poker
I done been through the rain, for real, I'm Al Roker
Life's a bitch, and guarantee that I'll grope her
If she wanna play golf, guarantee I'll out stroke her
If she wanna play around, I'll call my sister, she'll choke her
I live my life like I'm rollin' dice or playin' poker
No it is not over
I'm trying to get money like a damn stock broker
Meanwhile I'm not sober
Music is my bitch, she don't want me actin' Ike
I ain't screwing with the piff, I got a twenty bag of life
When I'm through with all the shit, then I'm gon' be actin' right
But I'm too legit to quit, so I'm gonna slap my wife
I love ya music
See my day was good, let's see how it go tonight
Cause in my neighborhood everybody wanna fight
Everybody get a dime, get a dutch, get a light cause
I don't wanna get sober

[Chorus]
I'm high off life, fuck it I'm wasted, and
I don't wanna get sober
They say you only have fun when you're young, well
I don't wanna get older
Cause this is that type of feeling that
I don't wanna get over
So let me live
