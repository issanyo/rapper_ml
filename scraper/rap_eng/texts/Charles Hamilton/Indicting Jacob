Don't make me regret this song. Now, let's get it on. From the moment we met, it was on. You was balling and I just had a MetroCard. Greg said, "There's this special broad. She could spit like the rest of y'all, or you. Don't you have a multiple personality disorder? Well, she's on the border." And she's smarter than me. She knows what it means to make marketing music. She's beautiful too. I knew that just when I was viewing you, Boo. We exchanged handshakes and grins. I couldn't wait for when. Then I told you I was interested to get to know you better. Who would think it would be forever?

Sorry for the way I fucking hated. The way you want trap beats, girl, let's make it. Every time you're flowing I see you naked. I just can't settle down. I'm happy at the fact you want to be mine. Happy at the fact you want to remind. Let's be defined. Every time I think of you, my mind shines like Einstein. A bright dime like a sunshine ray. Baby, won't you come my way. We make love and you come my way. And I just keep stroking. I ain't done now, babe. I want you to want me like no other. Hold no other. So, uh

I hope we have a daughter, name her Bella. I hope this is [order line] forever. Or instead of borderline, I get you every time you mess around with my mind. I'm fine. Like I said, let's redefine. Every thought you find in my mind is just a glimpse of your shine. But I ain't broke and no, I am hopeful we can go to the Poconos. Rolling in snow, rolling in snow. Maybe is the blow that we're rolling with. Maybe we can blow with this trap shit. I make trap hits, too. And that's official when referring to your flow. So I put your words in my flow. We're making love, so
