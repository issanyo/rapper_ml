[Verse 1]
I woke up to a warm corona
A cold blanket, see I warned you, I'm a loner
Instead of a morning Folgers
My day was born boring and colder
No-one knows if i was snoring or sober
It's her fault, pick a chick
So many distances getting depicted
But in this instance
I isolated myself, my passion is making me selfish
Say that you felt it
I'm out of luck, like the '98 Celtics
The Wicked Witch of the world, I stay meltin'
But my boomstick landed, I have to get candid
I got dark and was told to can it
Most of this album is self-loathing and damage
Forced to have fun like a Freshman on campus
I study hip-hop, which isn't to say I love it
But I was struggling so much I need a new budget

[Hook]
Am I real, am I a lie?
Can you feel what I provide?
This is apart of real life
This is the art of real life
But I wonder what you feel like
In my world outside a real life


[Verse 2]
Fuck it, I love this thing
I bring justice to dreams
I guess I'm stuck in the scene
My old friends were just along for the ride
As long as I provide, they like every song I write
I sip the warmths of vessyl like I was on but messed up
Not at all gone, I'm next up
The Pink Lavalamp is on the dresser
The girl that understands moved on, I left her
The strongest lesson, never let them see you sweat
I used to sweat and bleed in bed
She would touch my scars by grazing my lips with a kiss
We made love so sacred, and blissful, and intent
And though the pain was pleasure I swore I could make it better
It was after sex that I promised I would stay forever
But I didn't the clefs are my deepest lovers
Damn music we need each other

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
I climb back under the blanket and watch Southpark on mute
Wondering what they meant
Sometimes I wanna be ancient to have obvious wisdom so you can think while you rock to the rhythm, I'm not kiddin'
Young whipper snappers are spittin' crack and livin' the facts
Of which I'm after
I'll bite their style with a different laughter
I would've said witches but wisdom tells me to zip it
I'm confident in my penmanship, wish I could say the same for the censorship
I get it miss, the world has to relate, so instead of masturbate
I would rather have a debate
I've been toxic with Gothic gospel, now my logic is not as hostile
I hope you like it in recent years I've been so defiant
Now pray I have the heart to the  open minded
