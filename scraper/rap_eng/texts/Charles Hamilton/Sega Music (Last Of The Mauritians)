[Verse 1]
We are not the same, I am Mauritian
You don't understand, I suggest you get to reading
About my people, Wikipedia
We the only people that be speaking through the speakers
Sonic Maurice Hedgehog, no sneakers
But I'm running with all my blue features
I ain't depressed, I'm the color of the water
God is a woman and my lover is her daughter
But God wants me back, I don't get caught up
I'm not dying, cause I ain't even trying
Whoa, you don't get it, keep zoning
My mind is a hot line, yeah, phone in
I'mma take your requests in a sec
But right about now, I'mma rep for my set
Mauritian Sega, and I ain't a player
Cause this is my game, you don't like it? See ya later (Ah hah)

[Hook]
Who do music all day? (Charles Hamilton)
Who do music all day? (Charles Hamilton)
Yes I, yes I'm always making songs
Yes I, yes I'm always making songs
I said: "You best best respect the way I do my thing"
I said: "You best best respect the way I do my thing"
I said: "You best best respect the way I do my thing"
Whatever, you get it

[Verse 2]
Pink is the color of life, the inside of...
Every single woman that was born with a vagina
Men are from Mars and women are from Venus
They Venetian, rhymes with Mauritian
I don't hit women, I love 'em too much
But, I remember when they said I cuddle too much
I puff a few dutches and I will forget about it
But I'm sober, so how could you live without it?
This is my zone now, can you get around it?
Maybe not while I'm rhyming crazy hot
No Timbaland dog, it's your man Charles
I give a damn, not, I'm the fricking man y'all
Aw, Lord, let your hair down
Cause you're looking so good, I wish you were here now
So remember God's true gender
And the man was born was born 10th of November

[Hook]
Who do music all day? (Charles Hamilton)
Who do music all day? (Charles Hamilton)
Yes I, yes I'm always making songs
Yes I, yes I'm always making songs
I said: "You best best respect the way I do my thing"
I said: "You best best respect the way I do my thing"
I said: "You best best respect the way I do my thing"
Whatever, you get it

[Verse 3]
Maybe you could say I do gospel
Or maybe you could say I'm too hostile
Beat up a track in the name of my lady
Meaning I beat up a cat, insane, cause she made me
Baby, you know I was blessed with a gift
No stress when I spit, cause the sex is a trip
If I left on a ship, see the dress and some quick
Blow a breath on my lips and next we would kiss
I ain't trying to get neck from the bitch
But what the heck, she's sick in bed, did you get it?
They call an instrumental a music bed
And that ain't got nothing to do with head
But I'm saying, these other dudes suck
And she don't make a sound cause she love me too much
Long story short, I am the man, you dig
Truly yours, Sonic The Hamilton

[Hook/Outro]
Who do music all day? (Charles Hamilton) (Yes sir)
Who do music all day? (Charles Hamilton) (I'm here)
Yes I, yes I'm always making songs (This game is mine)
Yes I, yes I'm always making songs (Charles Hamilton, Demevolist)
I said: "You best best respect the way I do my thing" (Game over)
I said: "You best best respect the way I do my thing"
I said: "You best best respect the way I do my thing"
(It's the last of the Mauritians, hahahah)
Whatever, you get it (your ass ain't speaking)

We are not the same, I am Mauritian
Yes I am, uh huh
We are not the same, I am Mauritian
Yes I am, uh huh
We are not the same, I am Mauritian
Uh huh
We are not the same, I am Mauritian
Uh huh
We are not the same, I am Mauritian
Uh huh
We are not the same, I am Mauritian
Yep
