[Intro:]
I like happy things*
Cause it's like a dyslexic smile
Haha
Charles Hamilton

[Verse 1:]
I overthink
I think I said too much
I stayed in bed too much
This sucks
(Yeah)
I over-drink
I shouldn't feel this sick
There's a razor on my wrist
But I don't feel this shit
(Somebody somebody help me out) [Plays in background x8]
I see death with a smile
So while you all live forever
I'm stressed for a while

[Chorus:]
This is what I know
I'm all alone
Everywhere I go
I call it home
You can't help me, no
Don't call my phone
And if you feel like this
You know you're all alone
All alone

[Verse 2:]
I looked to heaven for devine intervention
And god says, "Charles, stop whinin' and bitchin," now
I'm in a position to, live a little better
If this isn't heaven then I'm pissed forever
I need to get it together

[Bridge: (2x)]

Don't judge me
You don't know me
You don't love me
You don't own me

[Chorus:]
This is what I know
I'm all alone
Everywhere I go
I call it home
You can't help me, no
Don't call my phone
And if you feel like this
You know you're all alone
All alone

[Verse 3:]
(Somebody somebody help me out) {*Plays in background (16x)*}
No matter how hard I try
I still manage to cry
I can't escape my mind
So pardon me while I just whine
Glass of wine in my...

[Chorus:]
This is what I know
I'm all alone
Everywhere I go
I call it home
You can't help me, no
Don't call my phone
And if you feel like this
You know you're all alone
All alone

[Outro:]
I'm NOT crazy!
Hehaha
I'm not crazy...
