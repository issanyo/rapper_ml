"Hamilton, Charles” on the way
I’m feeling good
Kinda

When am I ever feeling good? Weathering, because of the hood. Forever, I’ma sin, but be better than them
It’s like a prayer. Psychic nightmare. Staying beside you when I dare (deer/dear) to see what the world could bring me. To the world, I’m a genie. But YOU don’t really need me. Only when I talk to the fans. Awkward, again. How awkward can I stand? How awesome I’ve been in the past, but now it’s time to kick ass in stores. What’s in store? Another nightmare. Something I dare to glare at. When the night stares back, saying I don’t black like the night. So I pass the night back to the mic, through my breath. Who could step through the shoes I step with? No one knew that I was the best. But then, they knew I was the best. It’s such an… oxymoron. No Klonopin could stop me, so I go on. It’s hard to continue when you’re high in my mind, so I continue like “hi!”

Then I will let you go

My age is 8. Understand? But at 28, I stay away from wondering if Mankind could understand why I don’t whine. I don’t even pine. I sip my wine/beer/Hennessy/grey goose, and wish to remember the memories that may make you stay unstable when thinking about what a true MC is.

To be considered the top 5, dead or alive. Since I’m dead in your eyes. Forever I survive through the rhythms. Jazzy Jeff provided this rhythm. Pardon the “to pry”, but to pry is what all of y’all are getting. That’s a surprise! Magic to guys. I rap like Magic is beside, and passing

There is no HchO this time around. It’s like the Lake Show with just the guy that was brown. “Kobe! For three!” Shaq was black, and hopefully you know me. But Nash returned to the team, because we already know he was permanently being a West-coaster with his west openers. And passing the ball, and letting them all know what word is. When you say word in the hood when you see a highlight. We could be the highlight. You and I, if you like what I provide on the mic. Especially when I use a pen. And then, a lot of these guys will say that I have gotten back to my ways. But this was a sacrifice for y’all, and I don’t like it at all
