(Verse 1)
Look into my eyes baby tell what you lookin at?
I remember when these niggas told me that I couldn't rap
But now look
The rap game needs me
Can't leave rap alone it's too cheezy
To use a Jay line "I gotta be creative"
A Harlem representer
But im a Cleveland native
Midwest
A victim of incest
Then again the best of adrenaline mess with synonym of next
My heart is futuristic
It's slow and you can miss it
But I am use to trippin
From all you stupid niggas
You tryna out run a CHeetah in a rap race
But even CHeetah's need a CH this cat's great
Mad hate from the closeminded niggas
Is enough to make me snap and straight closeline a nigga
But im graceful for the success im grateful
If you hateful that's cus' im to great
So okay?
You can

(Chorus)
Call me Jeezy Hamilton
Call me Jeezy Hamilton
Call me Jeezy Hamilton
Jeezy Jeezy Hamilton
Call me Jeezy Hamilton
Call me Jeezy Hamilton
So fresh so clean
So fresh so clean
Call me Jeezy Hamilton
Call me Jeezy Hamilton
Me I'm in my spaceship
Me I'm in my spaceship
Call me Jeezy Hamilton
Call me Jeezy Hamilton
Call me Jeezy
Call me Jeezy
Call me Jeezy Hamilton

(Verse 2)
Yo
Maybe if I move a Pac
Have bucky on my lap
While im in a Cadillac
With a bottle Similac
Or whatever the substance
I have acceptable substance
But never because I just don't
F with the publics opinion
Of what should be mentioned in rap song
Fuck you dummies I hope your tour bas crash gone
That's wrong Charles
How you going wish death?
(Boo)
On these niggas please niggas
I am pissed stressed
At the state of this stress of the game
This mess is a shame
This message is for your brains
It's simple Hip-Hop dies because of Hip-Hop
Forget Pop && Rock
We're the ones who Pop && Lock
And use Auto-Tune and all sorts of tunes
And have no concept on Honesty
Im blessed to be in the position to expose the truth
If they kill me for it
Let me die alone in the booth
Till then

(Chorus)

(Verse 3)
Why I spit crack
Im smooth of the top
Pause
You other niggas moved off the block
Im only on Earth cus' a dude lost to Pac in a battle
The loser had to prove all you cocksuckers
Have to be real to achieve your three mil
Hense my modest history of drugs and free mils
Living in a society void of free will
E-Pill, Speed Will, Be still, Evil
So fall in love with my fast
Or pucker up to my ass
I won't sup if you mad
Fuck it im glad
It's not enough future
For yall niggas loosing your soul
For groupies and gold
My super Ego
Ain't from super as in hoes
Is from my dedication
You forever hating
I got that medication for you extra patients
Haha..
Aww man?
You can

(chorus)
