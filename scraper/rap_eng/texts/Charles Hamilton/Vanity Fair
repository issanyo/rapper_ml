I lay (laid) down in a London hotel room. You can tell who's been listening to mainstream radio. Don't blame me. Don't say so, either. Because I flame beats. Let me know what I mean to you. I'm so *mean* when I'm in the booth. No codeine, but I go lean on every goalie. With a hockey stick on my foot. (Like) "Get out of the way! Let me score!" Look at what I put in place. The motherfuckin' Ace (All Seeing Eye) of the State. And the whole globe... wow. Such a term. Can't fuck with a worm when he's puffin' sherm. (looks at joint) The sherm gotta be a little natural, though. I don't mean to hassle you hoes...

Keep your eyes on
The fire that I kill you with
Keep your eyes on
The liars life will bill you with
I'm on fire!
Beauty is a liar!
But I insist I'm ugly
You know the scenario...

I can't wait till you translate. The love we can make can break anybody. Holla at your man Drake. But he's been giving that 6 love. Mr. 666 is up. Pick it up like you dropped it to the floor. First 3 digits of a number will get me a cab to your door. I'm not mad anymore. Just let me black some more. Black Magick, employed. I am that BOY! Ever since I was on the floor with my ball and bottle. Y'all are going full throttle, with your hands to the sky, bowing down. Am I allowed to get down with sound?

I feel like force is hurting my teeth! More important to me is my beauty. Never seen in a boutique. I need a beautiful freak to ride with me. I'm in the passenger seat. She's in the driver seat, unfastening me. I'm like "Ma, can you please slow down? 'Cause we about to be dying! ...or somewhere flying through a balcony!" She's doing 120. 42nd street. 7th ave. I'm too high with my Heaven ass! Forever it's a class. Niggas better back down. Laugh at how I take my background and I call it "Mad Out"
