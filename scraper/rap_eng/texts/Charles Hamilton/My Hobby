[Verse 1:]

Yeah Yo

I love what I do, do what I love
Love from the crew, the crew's gettin' love
Who gets above this dude when he loves to spit through and through at issues that he ducks
But I ain't ducking like a coward nigga, as a matter a fact I'm ducking like sour(?) nigga
I get higher, it'll take you 'bout an hour nigga
To get you where I'm at then I straight up deflower niggas
I mean, May showers bring April's flowers
But i'm off the skelta, Bout to melt ya
Cause I do what I do off kilter, and these niggas say "Yo, I Felt ya"
How good does it feel to keep the kid who loves when it's real? Especially the love on the field
Swear to God it's not just My Hobby, but it is, I'm a hot little Punjabi

[Hook]

[Verse 2:]

I love what I do, do what I love
Above whose crew, But the crew is above
So what should I do when I reach up?
I Swear to God I married to 'em no prenup, and no wake up either
I'll wake up Ether, breath the shit in then i'll wake up Easter
Conference, Brooklyn's nets(?), you know who's best
But look who's next with all that Hip-Hop Mess
I Call my Cousin MC(?) like today is a matter of fact
She was probably chillin' in the back on her back
Having the time her life, counting her stacks, While
In my imagination I got a mountain of stacks
It's okay cause i'm about to black, come back with some shit
Back to back hits, classics, when you zipped up in plastic actually that's not it, you'll get beheaded, to be exact bitch

[Hook]

[Verse 3:]
I used to date this asian chick named Wang
She liked to play this 'lil game called golf
So I guess I'm darker than the Gulf of Spain
And Putting her in more pain, than her having to talk
Cause she's got a grill, that be coming outside of her mouth like her eyes feel whenever she comes outta the house
But that's Slanted, damn it I'm abandoned, Hamilton is candid, but man i can't stand it
The repercussions of being an ether puffer
Motherfuckers don't know if I'm even cuffing her
But even still I'm love with her
Cause she loves what I do while I do what I love
It's just for my boo, and my boo is who I love, and I love what we do when we do it under covers
And we ain't undercover lovers either, matter of fact we just started loving each other as divas

[Hook]
