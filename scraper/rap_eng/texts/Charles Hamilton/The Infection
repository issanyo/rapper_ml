Making love to the bottle. Bottle is making me swallow. Hollow inside. Holla at God, but She don't holla at Eye. And when She does holla, Eye ain't got a reply. Because Eye ain't die. Bottom line. If she wanna ride, Eye gotta die. So Eye can see Her Grace. So Eye can see Her face. Maybe she could pee on my face. And that would not be a waste. It'll just be the taste of hate. Of which Eye deal with. The shit Eye feel. The shit is steel. I'm on some real shit. Got a bat to the back. TLC. Put my hat to the back. Catch what I catch. Throw it out. You know what I'm about. I'm a motormouth. Whoa

Eye saw you, and Eye can't deny...

Harlem World. 12th grade. Minus 10. Peeing the bed. Hell made. Thinking of feds. Screaming ahead. While Eye fiend to be dead. Hell's slave. May the flames of Hell stay well in the grave of which Eye wish to be in. As a witch, Eye am a secret. Well, so mote it be. No flow in me. Just ODing with these pills. No ovaries, there's no skills. I'm stripping myself! CAN YOU FEEL ME?! Too unhealthy to be the Belle of thee, so... I'ma be a thug, too! High society, fuck you! Saying "hi." to society. I love you

Every curse. Every spell. I be workin' it well. I feel worthless, but, well... I be workin' in Hell. It's berserk to just tell all the curtains that fell when I pulled them down that they should look around. Hell. When you think about where I should be right now, I will be the guy who might tear the ceiling down of the sky. Get to space. No disgrace(d). I will get misplaced. Unmarketed. I like to be myself. Dumb smart to kids. But, like I said. I pee in the bed. Just screaming. Waiting to die. No reason to say I'm alive. These tears, I'm fighting them now. And I ain't write none of this down. I just understand style. I just understand sound. Hope you understand me now. Where's my family? Am I proud?
