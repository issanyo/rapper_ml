[Verse 1]
If no one understands me
Then lie and say that you do
I can make it the truth
Just buy it, save it, and use it to live
We all know I need music to live
But the beauty of it is:
You too can move your fist in the fight
Right?
All you gotta do is write
And if at all possible, we gotta move the light
Make it shine where we want it to
In front of you
I been watching the stars since the days I wasn't under roofs
The stars in the sky are the stars in the screen
A part of me believes I have a heart that doesn't beat
It's "a capella"
My mind provides the drums
And I don't mind the dumb cause they minds gotta be numb
To not feel what I'm bringing
I might stop
If when I dream I can't see what the night's got
And I just hit the right spot
You like that?
Then come watch

[Chorus]
And you can be my starchaser tonight
Don't be afraid of how fast you go
You can see as far as lasers and lights
Close your eyes and let it all go
(Meet me in outerspace)
Let the good times roll
(I will hold you close)

[Verse 2]
Over your head like a planet
But clear like a bandage
To cover such unclear damage
What you see is what you need to believe
How ironic; I don't believe in myself, I need to get help
Crying out over the beats for myself
The smile in your eyes is nothing but lesions and whelps
But legions have felt what I bring, so that helps
Dreaming of belts
I gotta be the champ
"He's the man," is what they must say
What way could I give up, the 'up' way
If I give up, I show love to the sky
When you give up it's like saying "fuck it and die"
I've had enough of the lies so catch up cause it's time
Fine
My mind will not stop ticking
It's not a clock, stop trippin'
This is a hot written
I'm the one that the stars shine for
I'm more than a leader, I'm gravity times four
So hold me down

[Chorus]
And you can be my starchaser tonight
Don't be afraid of how fast you go
You can see as far as lasers and lights
Close your eyes and let it all go
(Meet me in outerspace)
Let the good times roll
(I will hold you close)

[Verse 3]
The breeze never lies
The disease in my mind needs to recline
Chill, I will be there in time
Where is there?
Here, top of the world
I love my hair, dear
But I'm not gonna curl
If I cut my hair, it's just me comin' off of the top
Someone lost they spot
If I come across as cocky, stop me
I see, 'humble' is the new 'asshole'
Well, I guess I have the worst rap flow
Mad dough was the blessing I've recieved
Blessings are the best lessons everyone recieves
You believe, you learn
I need to learn
To believe
To give beats freezer-burn
We could turn darkness into a large kiss
From God's lips
All pink, that's some Charles shit
Aww, shit
Hehe
Hah
Charles Hamilton

[Chorus]
And you can be my starchaser tonight
Don't be afraid of how fast you go
You can see as far as lasers and lights
Close your eyes and let it all go
(Meet me in outerspace)
Let the good times roll
(I will hold you close)
