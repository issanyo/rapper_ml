[Chorus]
But all my pain and my suffering
Lost me down the line
I know
That all my pain and my suffering
Will go and pass me by
(Now I’ve got all my day…)

[Verse 1]
My lane is the sky
My brain is divine
Still I refrain from getting high, goodbye
Everybody talking bout the pain I provide
Still hurts but I entertain you with mine
I used to get jumped but I can still fight
Primarily to focus on my real life
Bi Polar but living life in real time
One dose of my dope and I feel fine
Pick a flow
My whole life is now digital
A nigga knows how to get physical
I dissed the others on the XXL cover
But it was unheard, boy I got some nerve
I see Vanessa Satten in Harlem she loves me
She said I’m glad to see you back because its ugly
She wants to know what’s up with me?
I said I don't know if y'all really fuck with me
I’m too real

[Chorus]
But all my pain and my suffering
Knocks me down the line
I know
That all my pain and my suffering
Will go and pass me by
(Now I’ve got all my days to be free)

[Verse 2]
Fame is not a game
But to blame is
But to blame is dangerous
It ain’t shit
I ain’t mad at Briana
Not mad my momma
I ain’t even mad at you niggas hatin'
I knew you niggas would think Sonic was some lame shit
But he was all I had as a lame kid
And my theory was based on the ancient
But y'all know better than me
So I don’t say shit
Everyone on social media hopes to beat me up
Or hope to be me but with dough and freaks to fuck
So greedy I don’t even speak too much
I go and get weed smoke and eat the Dutch
But like I said I refrain from the high
So I don’t know about ya heart my aim is your mind
I just do me and let game decide
Some came to win I came to die
Goodbye

[Interlude: Spoken]
Like I was saying man I been talking to people from a distance. Talking to people from a distance, and now I’m like right in front of you so, I don’t know how this shits gonna work. It’s gonna work though. Yo

[Chorus]
But all my pain and my suffering
Lost me down the line
I know
That all my pain and my suffering
Will go and pass me by
(Now I’ve got all my days to be free)
But all my pain and my suffering
Lost me down the line
I know
That all my pain and my suffering
Will go and pass me by
(Now I’ve got all my days to be free)
But all my pain and my suffering
Lost me down the line
I know
That all my pain and my suffering
Will go and pass me by
(Now I’ve got all my days to be free)
