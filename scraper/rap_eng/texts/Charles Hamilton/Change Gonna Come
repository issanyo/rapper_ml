It's been a long
A long time coming but I know
Change gonna come

[Verse 1: Charles Hamilton]
Prisoner to my cerebellum
So I reach out to the listeners
And my mission is I better tell 'em
Our fear of a free mind is hearing
Your spirit can die anytime
You need to cry and so you hide it deep inside
Reason why?
How can you change what was written?
Easy, don't focus your brain on what they mentioned
I got so used to tryna make due
I feel like I'm cheating when I'm faced with a break through
The man in the mirror keeps saying I hate you
I respond like lil nigga I made you
Slay those sayin they could break you
So when I take a break I go ape come back and play fool
When they think they won that's when I crush them
Change is eminent I evolve so it's nothing
What's the discussion

[Verse 2: Asher Roth]
We've been pompous ever since Columbus couldn't work a compass
We've accomplished what we've conjured up while conscious Unconsciously we've conquered all the eye can see
Constantly concocting more options but jobs are still obsolete
It seems so odd to me, an odyssey
How honesty is honestly the rarest thing upon us
It's astonishing
How did all the honest people vanish from the planet?
Leaving us a laundry list of problems to acknowledge
While plotting with my phonics me and Conic and B.o.B
Nag Champa rises as I sit down and sketch my rhymes
Stretch my mind to figure out what's next in line
The next Em, Ye and Andre?
Nah homie its just been a long
A long time coming

[Hook]

[Verse 3: B.o.B]
Well as you listening to this track
You probably about to blog about it and maybe say its wack
Or maybe compare the verses to see which one of us has snapped
Completely ignoring the fact that this is way more than rap
Cause I happen to be on a magazine you happen to see this issue
Some people wish you well man some people turn against you
Some people even call up to the station just to diss you
You bitch you, you only mad at your self here's a tissue
But that ain't even my focus man that hate ain't on my menu
Im in a different city about to rock a different venue
My girl sent me a text message just to say "i miss you"
It won't be long before I'm home baby but the rent's due
Ha ha ha
