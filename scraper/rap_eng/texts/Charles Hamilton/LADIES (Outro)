(Silence)

First off, girls, let me tell you that I have love
If you stabbed me in the back or blessed with me a back rub
I missed a lot of you but if I wrote out every story
I'd be working on this damn tape til I was in my forties
And I'd never find a wife like that
With some of y'all I want those minutes of my life right back
But it's all good, cuz I guess they're all ours now
And you made me smile, ain't no reason to be sour now
So we're still cool, even though we stopped chilling
Before the real love, I guess I needed top billing
I got a lot of time, it ain't like I got children
So even if I called you a name, you're not villains
The truth is, sometimes I'm reclusive as hell
I can be a smart ass and act stupid as well
Why go out to shop early? Let's watch Kobe drop thirty
Watch Naruto forever, but I say I'm not nerdy
And at times it may seem like I'm emotionless
But I swear that in your heart is where my focus is
No worries bout some other girl I'm stroking with
I'm rolling up my sleeves, there's no hoes and tricks
So I'll sacrifice for you if you sacrifice for me
That's a lavish life for and a magic wife for me
If you tolerate me acting like a baby when
You turn the game off, I'll tolerate your crazy friends
When your day begins, Chelsea Lately ends
You know Imll hit you up, cuz you make me grin
But that's ahead of now, this is for the girls who shaped me
All the girls who slayed me, all of those who saved me
Whether good or bad, it was all of you who made me
So..
