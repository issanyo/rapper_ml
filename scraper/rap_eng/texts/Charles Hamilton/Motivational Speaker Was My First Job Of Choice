[Intro]
I bet y'all don't even know how emotional I really am...

[Verse 1]
Just recently I did a song with my mom
Now y'all know what the blog is on
And you see where I got it from
To be honest, I still feel dumb
Feeling numb, wanting to smile, remembering pain
Remembering change, still remembering my name
And I freestyled when my mom grabbed the pen
Which is my claim to fame
Migraine's, OK. Please give me room to decay!
Let me remember some shit which could make me fade away
From this pouting phase
The "Moving Mountains, but I doubt it" phase
My mom was smiling in my face
Knowing my talent could carry me
Thousands, islands, without a taste
Thousands of 'em
Smiling cause I love her
But do y'all love us?
What?

[Hook]
Carry on...
Bunch of people talking, all them niggas playing, talking 'bout
Carry on...
What is y'all niggas talking 'bout, what is y'all saying?
It's getting harder to...
Carry on...
And even though it may be hard to understand it
Everybody say: "Ya got to carry on"
Everybody say: "Ya got to carry on"

[Verse 2]
Wake up next to my blonde chick
Like, being honest, I don't wanna live
She's like: "You gotta be kidding me, you just got over this!
You gotta sober up, quick!"
I'm like: "NO! It isn't the liquor
It isn't the swisher". Honestly, I don't fit in this picture
I'm not who I thought I was
I thought it was love, nothing but a bought buzz
What the fuck has humanity taught us?
Starstruck when I look at people who love me
It's all Charles but, there is the star
Chuck. But y'all don't care about the C
You only care about the 3 and never care about me
Staring at myself in the mirror so proudly
Sarcastically I speak!
I pass it on the beat (Charles Hamilton)
Action for me, hear that clap then I speak

[Hook]
Carry on...
Bunch of people talking, all them niggas playing, talking 'bout
Carry on...
What is y'all niggas talking 'bout, what is y'all saying?
It's getting harder to...
Carry on...
And even though it may be hard to understand it
Everybody say: "Ya got to carry on"
Everybody say: "Ya got to carry on"

[Verse 3]
I'mma be real, I'm afraid of deadmau5
His head is full of mirrors
When I look at him I can't see myself anymore clearer
Than what you're hearing, right now
Never understood his lifestyle
Thousands, Millions, billions of people
Staring at him and they feeling so gleeful
Cause they can see themselves
And I can't see the people for themselves
They all got domain names, so strange
But I came into the game to remove
Your animosity, and anonymity
Of admitting to me you truly like me
For me without gossiping
Are you watching me?
Obviously not, B
So, therefore, I'll go kill myself being sloppy
Stumble onto a bed of spikes
My head isn't right but
Every night, I say I gotta...

[Hook]
Carry on...
Bunch of people talking, all them niggas playing, talking 'bout
Carry on...
What is y'all niggas talking 'bout, what is y'all saying?
It's getting harder to...
Carry on...
And even though it may be hard to understand it (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Everybody say: "Ya got to carry on"
Everybody say: "Ya got to carry on"

Carry on...
Bunch of people talking, all them niggas playing, talking 'bout
Carry on...
What is y'all niggas talking 'bout, what is y'all saying?
It's getting harder to...
Carry on...
And even though it may be hard to understand it
Everybody say: "Ya got to carry on"
Everybody say: "Ya got to carry on"

Carry on...
Bunch of people talking, all them niggas playing, talking 'bout
Carry on...
What is y'all niggas talking 'bout, what is y'all saying?
It's getting harder to...
Carry on...
And even though it may be hard to understand it
Everybody say: "Ya got to carry on"
Everybody say: "Ya got to carry on"

[Outro]
I'm not made to diss so...
None of that Jesus shit, I don't need to quit
Goddamn!
