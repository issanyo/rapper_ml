I got some shit on my chest let me get some shit off my chest real quick [?]
I don't know if niggas read the bible or nothing but
There's a story called
Cain and Abel
Abel had the blessing and Cain, well he didn't
So he hated him
Yo

[Verse 1]
It's called talent, inherited at birth
A blessing and a curse
Brings out the best of any person
Your messing with the worst can forever be the persistent cause of envy
Even from those who act friendly
I can sense the tension within the
Not great just to hurt you
Sorry if you feel god jerked you
But I can feel it in the air life a bitch and i can smell it in her perfume
I don't have the power to curse you
You don't have the power to curse me
I found my purpose
So in your search you hurt me
How is it my fault that you're a worthless jerk beat?
There's no way that your words could hurt me
But they get under my skin so its verbal herpes
I'm blessed
So if it's hate you have for me
Than you just committed blasphemy
You hate God nigga

[Hook] X2
I see it in your eyes, I feel it in the way you shake my hand
It's Cain and Abel
I hear it in your lies, I notice everyday you ain't my fan
It's like Cain and Abel

[Verse 2]
Jesus spent four thousand
But I ain't see shit about a thank you
So why should I hate you?
I guess I wanna hear "Charles I really do appreciate you"
But instead they look straight to my face and say two words that can break through Teflon
The reason, cause I'm gassed like Exon(Fuck outta here)
With stretch arms I show love try to show that I've grown up
No luck
If god is modest why do we have such majestic things, these majestic powers, so
Let's give our praise to him by being great to him
He gave me talent so Imma be great for him
So fuck fans I ain't great for them
I can't make them into what I need
Cause they gon heat to they own crease
So people like me don't stay on teams
I admire teammates and they own teams
I'm a coach and a player leading play on teams
Who needs an opponent on they own team
Why you getting mad get on you're J-O-B
I might be chewed but I still got my flavor like day old green
So feast up
I even see it in my flesh and blood I'm always stepping up
Giving nothing less up than a hundred percent
Plus extra love, to the hard nose type
So how the fuck am I not a R-O-Y
Go ahead and kill me, Charles won't die
Charles won't lie down and say "who are those guys"
Charles will let a semi auto fly
If I get my hands on a gun you ain't gotta put me on a fucking pedestal
I stand on the sun
By Christs side i stand with the sun
No time for the amateur fun, I'm fucking done
