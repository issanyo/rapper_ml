Bippity boppity boop
Ever since the first day I got in this booth
I was jottin' the truth
You plottin' on who?
I could just do what optometrists do
And make you see only what I want you to
Follow me dude, apology due?
Not even. I'm honestly rude, take a second
You gotta love my honesty, dude
I could possibly prove how much my cockiness rules
When I body these fools
Cause most of these rappers is actors
While attacking, I'll just black on 'em like abra cadabra
Fact and the fact lets add and subtract to practice your rapping
And go somewhere and get crap in the bathroom
It's my duty to prove I'm the shit
So is it cocky when I say that I'm why music exists?
No one is fuckin' with me
And I'm lovin this beat, so nobody can fuck with Sha-leik

(Chorus)
They tell me it ain't normal what I do, it's
(Magic)
I tell em' I was born with what I do, it's
(Magic)
Somethin' like a rabbit in a hat, rabbit-rabbit in a hat
(Hey!)
Rabbit in a hat, rabbit-rabbit in a hat
(Hey!)
Rabbit in a hat, rabbit-rabbit in a hat, it's
(Magic)

(Verse 2)
For my next trick
Watch me make the best skip town
When I get down
Get out. The exit is right over there
You don't see it? Wahlah
Nigga there's a door, now peep it. Poof
Be gone. Mad at me? Respawn
I'm lookin' for a nameless loser to feast on
I'm a beast if you get me annoyed
Cause my 16's the tiger from Siegfried and Roy
Shit. He destroys everything in his path
That's what happens when they think that they can bring me to crash
Me crashing is a thing of the past
Crash is a drug term and I'm bringin' it crack
Pink and just black, I'm Bret Hart with the next bar
Fuck with Charles' music, you meet the Sharp-Shooter
I'm the reason why your heart pounds hatred
I'll make your whole family the Hart Foundation

(Chorus)
They tell me it ain't normal what I do, it's
(Magic)
I tell em' I was born with what I do, it's
(Magic)
Somethin' like a rabbit in a hat, rabbit-rabbit in a hat
(Hey!)
Rabbit in a hat, rabbit-rabbit in a hat
(Hey!)
Rabbit in a hat, rabbit-rabbit in a hat, it's
(Magic)

(Verse 3)
For my last trick, I'mma need a bad bitch
And her bad friend. Meet me in the back in... 10 minutes
I'll call you a cab, you get in her box and I'll saw you in half
Great trick, right? Wow, this kid's nice
I black like midnight on this mic
I spit like a pitcher, give dykes some liqour
And I'm fly enough to be a "bitch ass nigga"
Forget that. See, I ain't tryna be nice
But I'm nice, therefore, I ain't tryna be nice
I spit one bar, and you were jockin' me twice
I spit one bar, and you were jockin' me twice
If I possibly like your property
I might "Go to jail" for rollin' that Monopoly dice
Then take over. I'm the one, like mono
A cracka, like Polly
You want me? Serve me. Volly
Gone

(Chorus)
They tell me it ain't normal what I do, it's
(Magic)
I tell em' I was born with what I do, it's
(Magic)
Somethin' like a rabbit in a hat, rabbit-rabbit in a hat
(Hey!)
Rabbit in a hat, rabbit-rabbit in a hat
(Hey!)
Rabbit in a hat, rabbit-rabbit in a hat, it's
(Magic)
