I can't sit right now, but my stamp. I'm the champ. I lie down, then "I can." But "I can't." 50 Cent. Sick of getting considered an idiot. Sick of my flow. Jacking yours! Back indoors! Listen, I know. That's just how I do. This my flow, this my move. I sampled my uncle, like he's Duke. What you want to do? Uncomfortable. "Is you wet? Is you is?" "Is you pet? The issue is? Get you. Next." I get my kids, I get my checks

I'm tryna light it tonight
I'm tryna drink; what you like?
I'm tryna get right with you
I'm tryna get right with you
I'm tryna get right with you...

Niggas want to embarrass me. I spend every Saturday with [white chick] and Sarah Jay. Don't understand, look that'a way. Bitches want to embarrass me. I spend Saturdays with Sarah Jay. Sorry Mecc, but I been tripping. Listen! Listen! I be spitting! And listening. And giving in. Hand script when Hamilton with the scent. Sanskrit when I'm traveling. Can't stand it? Well, then we battling. That's just what I do. Do not acknowledge my fly move. I call this flow Purple and Gold. You don't like it, it's hurting your soul

I'm tryna light it tonight
I'm tryna drink; what you like?
I'm tryna get right with you
I'm tryna get right with you
I'm tryna get right with you...
