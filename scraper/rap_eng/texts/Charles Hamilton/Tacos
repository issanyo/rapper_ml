[Verse 1]
Its 2:03 in the morning the vocal booth is pouring
Cause I choke the tubes and stoke her loose, Pokin' moves
Just getting boners being the dude who storms with the truth
But boredom is my new form of being cool
Dude, Laura warned Myrtle that being Steve is an issue
And didn't believe it
Until the speech of being reason for a missile being secretly misused
Heat seeking, my teeth grit cause peep this, I be on my peace shit
My war is with the belief less, gee whiz
I'm a G taking a wiz on the beat
Sacred and sweet the things I say when even speaking
Pervasive, persuasive, when leading to the basics
And reap what you lay in your acres
I get a heaping helping of Ether
And proceed to mouth the features of people who needed help from being...
Yooooo...

[Hook]
Tacos...
Tacos...
Tacos...
Tacos
We about to get, We about to get, Tacos
We about to get, We about to get, Tacos
We about to get, We about to get, Tacos
We about to get, And Gorditas...

[Verse2]
Ironically I have a Disney fan base
Which honestly appeals to my rotten teeth
Cause I can face the monotony of being a 50 or your man Drake
Cause gothic scenes still have not received a damn break
Lots of teens in this land face what I conceive as standard hate
From now to supreme antiquated parenting
From obscene scenes standing in woman in mans place
Word to MTV, the planet must be sick of me
Parents that are strict reflect the planets that wish to visit me
Or wish to get a visit from me, it's apparent
Granted I'm baffling you young gunners with bum hunger
I just know some stunners who wonder if the suns number is one
I mean come on it sounds dumb, but I'm hotter than rettoh(Rita)
Hotter backwards, Now you gotta repeat it
God I'm retarded cause that's not how I said it but now that I see it
Wow I'm a genius, I am loud but conceited
(C'mon)

[Verse 3]
Peter Pan with pot, leave the land and
Plot to heat the land I drop next on with the hot test of songs
My guess is wrong, who wants a contest with lungs
To see if pride gets it on with writing songs that are less than 5 seconds
(Charles Hamilton)
As soon as this dropped you got blessed
As soon as your hips rocked you got lured into the Vortex, stop
Hot stepped, like here comes the, Hear thunder?
The brainstorm Is clearly jumping for the gear fumbler
I don't dress casual I dress radical
My sex is magical, and my stress is yes, that I know
I bet carrots grow when letting rabbits flow
MF Bunny, the best dressed on the coast of Madagascar
Pass hard
This is a jaguar starved since last March, and acting mad harsh towards the Backyardigans
You cats rap half hearted, is it the John Q inspiration or beyond you to spit some great shit?
