[Talking]
Can I be honest with you man?
I think I’m going crazy
For real
Niggas got me in my shit right now
It’s like I’m hearing voices and shit
Word

[Verse 1]
I’m not too sure but I think I’m starting to lose it
Reality is moving too fast for me to do shit about it
Patience is actually a nuisance
I’m picking up too much slack for me to move quick
So many areas asking me to do shit
All I fucking hear is “do that for me then do this”
Sometimes I swear I’d rather be reclusive
I put up with so much crap because of music
These days killing me, somebody coming at my creativity
For Pete's sake please wait, each beat made diligently
I sample my beats but niggas can’t hold a candle to me
And I’m Lyrically Gifted, I dismantle a beat
Put two and two together, it’s a mantelpiece
Inside a chapel, I am the shit and I know it
But the better the music than the closer the psychosis

[Hook]
It’s the voices
All I hear in my head are these voices
Can’t run can’t hide, it’s the voices
Some deem in my mind it’s the voices
I can’t avoid it
It’s the voices
Some deem in my mind it’s the voices
Can’t run can’t hide from the voices
All I hear in my head are these voices
I think I’m losing my mind

[Verse 2]
My short temper is shortened when I’m faced with shit that isn’t important
I want to see the end of this horseshit, bullshit, regardless it’s a rodeo
Bunch of niggas are critics, but they don’t really know me though
Hit me with the okie-doke, you sound like so and so
I guess being different means you’re being the same
Compare me to Em, cause he is insane
The next best is Kanye, cause I sample and dress prep
I guess yes, but what the fuck do you expect?
Label to un-labeled, place them on one table
Make them feel unable to break away from that one place they take you when they don’t know what to make of you
I been chasing this dream since 13, years later still don’t know what work means
Got a slew of ideas like a musical genius
But I still gotta come up with my name for my first single

[Hook]
It’s the voices
All I hear in my head are these voices
Can’t run can’t hide, it’s the voices
Some deem in my mind it’s the voices
I can’t avoid it
It’s the voices
Some deem in my mind it’s the voices
Can’t run can’t hide from the voices
All I hear in my head are these voices
I think I’m losing my mind

[Verse 3]
See I thought of death in a sense of innocence and since there was a form of millitance
That’s my frame of mind and I been in it since my birth
At funerals I would pretend that it hurts, but it didn’t
So I figured it’s worth living at first
But I’m a quitter so the minute it hurts
I’m a sit in that hearse to be dipped in the dirt
Finished with all the sinners in thoughts
And while the minister talks I rock the casket
Standing up, screaming out “Fuck you bastards” you placed me here
You and the voices you made me hear
Absolute silence, the crazy tears
I made my point; hearing voices caused my nuts to curl
You know it’s bad when you can’t trust your girl
Life’s a bitch, what’s she touching me for?
Think it’s time we had a fucking divorce
I don’t love her no more

[Hook]
It’s the voices
All I hear in my head are these voices
Can’t run can’t hide, it’s the voices
Some deem in my mind it’s the voices
I can’t avoid it
It’s the voices
Some deem in my mind it’s the voices
Can’t run can’t hide from the voices
All I hear in my head are these voices
I think I’m losing my mind

[Voice]
The Greatest trick the devil ever pulled was convincing the world he didn’t exist
