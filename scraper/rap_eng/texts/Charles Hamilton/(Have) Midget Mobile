[Verse 1]
Don't hurdle
One step over
Son Of a gun, number 1
Lets go, Sure
Want what I want, Fun summer Wonder
I should even have but I'm a Number one hunter
Cum doesn't come so I run like a punter
Homer to most but Focused when Under
Thumbs of a punk' s with broke controllers
Soakin' In the Sober so I'm Rollin In the wonder
Supposedly a Stunter but Focused on the Unsure
One dear person Be-Lurking In the thunder
Perfect In the Sun burn workin' on the Perch
One blunder Is to worry bout the Unsure
Another hurdle
Another Step
Another Breath
The lovers flesh
All basis that haven't been Covered yet
So step, Just step

[Hook]
What more can you ask of me I got a lot I gotta think about
I just want a little Life, What you think I'm fink about
Vertical Horizon, I'm On It, I'm On It
Vertical Horizon, I'm On It, I'm On It

[Verse 2]
Give me a sign, Perhaps air could give me a peace of mind when I reacha sigh
Shadow Said,"No need to Hide"
Bundles of funnel cake and pizza pie
Gotta diet of a riot
I'm tired of fighting, ride whips of trident, Like I give a shit
Side by Side with the Silent Tarantula, I take a chance and I strut
Lookin' At Shakespeare Like nice, but
All not nice thoughts Is Lookin' for A write up
Professor X, Still no Helmet
Been watching C-NBC (Where's my cut?)
I need a new suit that I can size Up
Corporate says I suck cause I don't try much
Max Potential, I have Credentials
Glasses, Gotta look back to miss you

[Hook]
What more can you ask of me I got a lot I gotta think about
I just want a little Life, What you think I'm fink about
Vertical Horizon, I'm On It, I'm On It
Vertical Horizon, I'm On It, I'm On It

[Verse 3]
Cop a Jack to watch my back Only when my pockets is fat
Other than that I chat
Keep the PC even though I Mac
Jackie Blue might Catch an Attitude
Rather move as A pastor, Rude
Mad cool but I ask for blues When looking at the news
My bad view who passes through
Old future, I just got passed the new
Feel It, Master blaster, Naked to the Few
Nude
K to the, N to the, You
Apostrophe D
Cop Squat
Gotta see me, In stock like the hottest CD
But whats Even Hotter, Gotta see me
Shot a peace Sign at the not-so PG
Feels like to live Is just a minute
My new Cell Phone Is a midget
Intricate

[Hook]
Vertical Horizon, I'm On It, I'm On It
Vertical Horizon, I'm On It, I'm On It
