[Intro]
You ever sit alone?
And the air conditioning is blowing on your back
And you just thinking bout, whoever
Imaginary friends

[Verse 1:]
I said I don't stare but you're very pretty
She said, I don't care if you don't stare
Cause you're staring, dig me
I'm like, aight
I see how she playing it
Cause she ain't ever speaking but her features are saying it
Her eyes are no particular color
But just enough to give you a glimpse of the vision she's smothered, with
You see love in her pupils like she's a great teacher
She's an 808 in great speakers
A straight diva
Too bad she refuses to speak
Her skin says it all
Yeah, her beauty is deep
She;s the wallpaper to my desktop
Next stop on the train in my brain is the bed, watch
If I can only log off and leave my room
And see if she exists, cause it's awful to assume
I'mma just let God talk to me through you
My hologram
So I don't care if you got a man

[Hook:]
Because you're not even real
I feel you
Therefore you gotta be real
I'm near you
And yet you follow me still
My rearview
Shows where you are
(3x)Let me feel your breeze on my back
(Be my summer storm)
Yeah

[Verse 2:]
I keep looking at pictures
Keep looking at scriptures
Maybe I was meant to not know you
But how can I pretend to not know you
In this rock I showed you how a cinder block can hold you
Down
The rock is my heart
Unbroken
Cause someone broke it
Now it can't be unmolded
Come over
Here
Put your hand on my heart
Only a man with scars can manage this heart
So genuine
Then again, many men said the same thing
So it sounds like a game thing
My name means "man"
Look it up
Google "Charles"
Pass the stardom
The meaning is good enough
Lets just lay here in the park
Under the stars, watch
Fall under leaves
Fall in love
Drop these notions that you cannot leave
You can
But why
You think that you can find a better man?

[Hook]
Because you're not even real
I feel you
Therefore you gotta be real
I'm near you
And yet you follow me still
My rearview
Shows where you are
(3x)Let me feel your breeze on my back
(Be my summer storm)
Yeah

[Verse 3:]
I don't want to sound over-possessive
But I'm sober and I know that I'm reckless
But who are you?
Maybe my intoxication
Can identify the woman in my eyes
I'm patient
My imagination
Might just have me waiting for awhile, but
I'm just glad you're laying in your bed somewhere
Hearing my voice in your head you stare
At the speakers
Playing my open letter
To whoever thinks that they know me better
Hold it together, Charles
Don't let your mind rule you too much
Cause when you think too much
You screw up
But I can't stop writing these letters to the stars
So goodnight, my whoever you are
(2x)Goodnight, my whoever you are
(2x)Whoever you are
Forever yours, Charles

[Hook](2x)
Because you're not even real
I feel you
Therefore you gotta be real
I'm near you
And yet you follow me still
My rearview
Shows where you are
(3x)Let me feel your breeze on my back
(Be my summer storm)
Yeah

[Bridge](2x)
Turn the AC on it's getting type hot (3x)
Turn the AC on, you already know
