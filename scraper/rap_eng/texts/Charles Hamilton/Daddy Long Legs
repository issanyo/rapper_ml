Now Is the time to choose if you’re down with the dude who is a clown in his shoes. I wear clown shoes. Why should I take a breath? Take you breath away. Make you step. Make you move, then make you sway, then make Heather B take away your grace. Shit, and it ain’t evening morning. I’ll be damned if this shit isn’t boring. Important to me is music. I’ve been scorching and bleeding for music. I am the  Son, wilding for some. Three, Two, Five, Six. What? ONE. Sick of coming up with numbers, man. Sick of asking bitches to come again. I’m not mumbling. But if I do, I’d still be the greatest in the booth. And I’m home, so...

Playing in the spiderwebs, I think he bit my eye
Stumbled in a liar’s bed, and I ain’t even cry
Heavy is the heart, heavy is the hand
Light when on my feet, here I stand

Before the Eye saw the Eagle. It saw ONE, and ended up caught in evil. So when I spend dollars, I just holler at anybody who is talking regal. All are believable,  because they believe in me. And I believe the bull that I see. To the right, to the right like Dilla. To the left like the bitch in Thriller. Thriller is life, apparently. Marry me while I’m killing the mic. Still enticed, still in tune? I’m killing this groove and I’m still feeling right. My ceiling is white, like I started from the bottom, nigga. See, you got a problem, nigga? I’ll be Harlem and Brooklyn and rob a nigga

Heavy is the heart, heavy is the hand
Light when on my feet, here I stand

I am the Sun, I’m supposed to be over your head. so smarten up or you know they you’re dead. If you’re frozen instead of being hot, prepare to be shocked when you look to your right. You might find an eagle, you might find evil. But I’m still stuck in the middle. To the left like a knight I might. They hate me but they please me. They say I be too easy, but in Sonic there is no other level than Hard. Better get a broad, show her how to press A, while I press Escape. The Apple CEO, yesterday
