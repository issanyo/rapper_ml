[Verse 1]
Haven't seen me cause I'm sick of getting looked at
Cause every time a nigga see me, I just look whack
I don't wanna be like Noah if he look back
Cause I will turn to dust and you could look that..
Up, I'm the lame CH
But I'm living past one-hundred and eighty eight
You could find me in the Genesis
I be the beginning of the end
Finally my living will begin
I believe that I could be the pitcher of the tent
That only youth and my believers could live in
And all of the celebrities and lawmakers
Can suck my balls like jawbreakers
Ain't nobody visit the man
Y'all know where I live and didn't give me a hand
I decide who I show some love to
I'm 5'7, y'all got some growing up to do

[Hook]
Everybody know what it is
Everybody know what it is
Everybody know what it is
Everybody know what it is

Open up your eyes and see
Open up your eyes and see
Open up your eyes and see
Open up your eyes and see

[Verse 2]
Nigga was plotting a sequel to Awkward
If I do it, will I seem like a stalker
Can't nobody envision me as a pauper
I'm an author, niggas is ash
Been the nastiest since tennis class
In the past, get a grasp of that
Who said I never grabbed a gat
Instead of a cabbage patch, did I stash a pack
Get cash cause I used to flip halves of crack
Was I addicted to the high or addicted to the bye?
Only Noah is the nigga in the sky
I flip keys like S-T-E-V-I-
E if you wonder, accept me as a try
To bless you with divine arresting of your mind
I'm in the hood like Pepsi and a slice
Either two sodas or I chew, so what?

[Hook]
Everybody know what it is
Everybody know what it is
Everybody know what it is
Everybody know what it is

Open up your eyes and see
Open up your eyes and see
Open up your eyes and see

[Verse 3]
The used to say I couldn't focus in school but..
I used to focus on the future too much
I was about age 9 when I grew up
12 years later, now I wanna screw up
I'm on point, niggas say "You could've fooled us"
Shouldn't have told me, now I gotta OD
Used to walk the Sahara in your cold feet
Only stopping when I'm thirsty for a Sobe
Too quick, I don't wanna do shit
Acres of blue piff my nigga, the true chick
Take you to school, maybe get late for some new bitch
If she doesn't mind, baby do you give
Truth is y'all don't know what abuse is
So face the music, do you see...

What we, what we have is much more baby

[Hook]
Everybody know what it is
Everybody know what it is
Everybody know what it is
Everybody know what it is

Open up your eyes and see
Open up your eyes and see
Open up your eyes and see
Open up your eyes and see
