One of these days, this vein is going to get slit. Running this shit is not what I call a game. Say it’s all from the brain. Going off like something lame when you don’t like it. Why would I write it? A new style, why spit? You hostile like Y6? Then I move in and out of my house like, why are you that bitch? Or why is that bitch you? Mad confused. But I got magick, my dude. I knew I would return I got Jesus lives with me. Unless I got crossed. Then I got to burn. I’ll see you from the urn

Promises can break your heart
But broken hearts can mend
So I have a master plan of mine
I will be back again

I met two soulmates and I broke up with them. Go 8? Yo, what is this? Why is music what I’m living for? I see C, I see I, S is in SEGA. Bitches say move. This is a different day to see why. Music is all I see, this is all I need. I’m not trying to talk like a guy who is arguing with me. I don’t even want to talk, I want to read. Fuck going off on a beat, that’s freedom. I’m enslaved to a page, like Nas. Take it away. Sitting on the throne with my head covered. I’m dead a lover, that’s enough for you

Promises can break your heart
But broken hearts can mend
So I have a master plan of mine
I will be back again

When you flip a coin, you see Sonic’s best friend. And then what’s promised and destined never lands on the flat side. The flat side has ridges, bitches. So condoms are problems when you’re trying to make them digits.  Sacred living, sacred spitting. Saying it ain’t shit to my niggas. I should have asked that. AFLAC, insure it. I’ve been pure, then nervous, then unsure. No deodorant, no more to say. I’m just looking at Four, don’t go away. And if there’s more OK. To y’all I pray. I pray for you

Promises can break your heart
But broken hearts can mend
So I have a master plan of mine
I will be back again
