[Verse 1]
(Elisa, why’d you do that?)
I step in the shower only securing my dirt
Sure, I’ve been hurt, but hurt is perched on the shore
The waves splash my heart, I stay back and start swimming
I have a supernatural obsession with smart women
The smarter you are, the harder I fall
But don’t use your IQ to make my broken heart your haiku
Pride proves to be the fluid in my sly moves
Guys who try to do my voodoo get lied to
But when they work their magic before I meet the right women
I fight running to try to un-right what’s coming
So, what's coming? My virginity intact
The industry is wack, but don’t match my wack tendencies
She was a virgin like me, I relate to her
On a date with her, I made my move in a horror flick
Bad sign there
Bad times are fair when your last try at love in this life was nightmare
So every night, I stare at my ugly refection to try to find a love that is a blessing
I am an ogre, diseased with the need to please
I plead with my dreams to send me the Mrs. "Me"
Then I wake up and take this lonely shower...
With my clothes as who holds me for hours
(I’m too afraid to be naked)

[Hook]
I am afraid of the love I have for you
I am a virgin
Take your time when you love me
Take your time when you love me
Take your time when you love me
I don’t want this love to fade

[Verse 2]
Once upon a time, a beautiful muse
In her light blond hair and her beautiful shoes
Heard my music, and said she truly was amused
She just ate the apple; enjoyed her view of me in the nude
I didn’t realize my nudity, and moved behind the bushes
Like, "Why is she looking?"
She touched my shoulder and told me to relax
Before I could cry, she holds me in her lap
She said "Enjoy your beautiful body."
And she kissed my cheek
I felt a tingly sensation in places I didn’t see
She touched me somewhere I’ve never been touched
It felt so fast, and I’ve never been rushed
I felt blood rushing down there, and...
She look down there, and it all went down from there
As I tried to resist, my eyes twitched, and...
And... I lost it

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
My innocence gone, her mission was strong:
Give me a new feeling for me to get on and live with
But as the grand implosion occurred
She walked away, holding her curves like they were golden
She smiled, winked, and strutted
I feel like I'd been smutted; what you humans say "nutted"
I felt disgusting, I should have known better
Didn't want to cry, but I couldn't hold it together
Now my friends say I'm a whore; I'm just confused
I can’t trust her, and never trusting who wrote this: Me
So to put you on notice, my body is as delicate as a lotus
And in my virginity garden, you're a locust
Love is for those who live life unfocused
And I've fallin' in it; crawlin' in it
Lost my virginity, now my thoughts are spinnin'

[Hook]
