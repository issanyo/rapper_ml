[Verse 1]
I believe that it's nothing to love me
Even when I'm high and there's nothing above me
Get conceded when I'm weeded
But you sober me fast
My napoleon ass, just blushes, you cut me
But instead of bleedin' I stay and hang with my injury
That I've been blessed with
So the next trip that I go on, my eyes are out for you
I don't even know what I'm about to do
But I do know that eyes give out the truth
Lies are mouth pollution
So I gotta figure out a solution
Without abusin'
Everything I am about, so how can I do this
Feels like I'm about to lose it
Girl you got a mouth just use it
Your eyes f*ckin' talk to much
For me to hear you
I think it's time I be near you, in clear view

[Hook]
Spend my days
Spend my nights
Spend my time
Thinkin' of you
In my face
In my lies
In my mind
Do you think of me to

[Verse 2]

Maybe it's what time demands
But you a star, and here's what the sky commands
Sometimes you only shine through the glance
But if I had that chance, I would dance right where you stand
Even tho you shine bright enough to blind any man
You like it just pray us, high above everything
And my eyes from down here are all drowning tears
Cause you a princess, I ain't have the crown in years
Burger King birthdays as a youngin'
Back when I wasen't sure that I could be something
I gotta make the step to be king
Cause you gon' go from princess to the queen
What does that mean
I really gotta see if I can read, oh shit I can write so I believe

[Hook]
