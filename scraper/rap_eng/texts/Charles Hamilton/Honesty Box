[Verse 1]
Laying back
Blazing a sack to this banging track
Reflecting on the haters..
Saying that my game is wack
My name is that of a man destined..
To not be lost in the clandestine
My hands lessen
Roam free
Get a hold of me
Impossible for you
If you not me, you don't know me
I keep the faith
I wanna be bigger than Pac
Even if he was alive
Not hit with them shots
H.O. copped the hammer..
So i sit with the Glock..
To the top of my temple
Picture me propping my thoughts on the couch…
Too lost to say ouch
Cuz anybody can say they a boss in a drought
Watchu talking about?
Says the listener who stays ignorant..
Cuz i refuse to do simple shit
Basically
I pray for mental stability
The same kinda thoughts..
Before i enter the industry

[Hook]
Tell me something i don't know..
Tell me that there is a place i don't go..
When i write
Tell me that i won't go..
Spotlight
I want shine in a boat load..
Of hot dimes
They keep saying keep dreaming baby
Keep dreaming, baby
They keep saying, keep saying..
Keep dreaming baby
Keep dreaming, baby

[Verse 2]
I'm smoking bud again
Talking to hoes i want to fuck again..
Cuz they know i got no love for them
I want a woman who's less demanding
More understanding..
Doesn't stress what can't be
Unless im stressed by family
At which point she steps in..
And takes away the stress a man see's
No question, can she..
Make it all good
If it takes head.. then she would
I got some painful calluses on my foot
But she would massage them if she could
But i don't know if i could find her..
Would i mind her if i was standing right behind her?
Meantime
My mind is on a timer…
That i created
See why I'm a rhymer?
So alone
But in the highest position
Don't mind me..
I am just tripping
Please listen

[Hook]
Tell me something i don't know..
Tell me that there is a place i don't go..
When i write
Tell me that i won't go..
Spotlight
I want shine in a boat load..
Of hot dimes
They keep saying keep dreaming baby
Keep dreaming, baby
They keep saying, keep saying..
Keep dreaming baby
Keep dreaming, baby

[Verse 3]
There's something in the air..
If i didn't buy my niggas something
Would they care?
The answer should be yea
I cop bud and bottles just to follow..
The hood rules
Put your niggas on then you a good dude
They say pass the ROC
I'm like "put your work in."
Cuz me putting money up for nothing Ain't workin
Niggas ain't workin
Its fucking depressing
Biggest excuse of the year is this fucking recession
Same time
I'm stuck with a blessing
So i ain't listening to your fucking suggestions
No disrespect
But i fought for this..
I wasn't taught this shit
That's why i be talkin shit
Get off my dick
I say to naysayers
Since i signed a deal..
On D.O.'s great table
I knew that shit would change…
Not the name but the game
Cuz not a truth is in the game…

Keep dreaming, baby
They keep saying, keep saying..
