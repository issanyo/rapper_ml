[Hook]
And I can't let it go

[Vers One: Charles Hamilton]
All my idols are a puddle
My rivals are in rubble
Why am I in trouble?
Dying for rebuttals
Crying like I love you
Night is when I snuff you
Signs of what can crush the minus sign above the struggle
Silent when I cuddle
Private with my stubble
Higher than the mud you Nolan Ryan'd in the scuffle
Timing when I hug you, so I'm lying when I fuck you
Trying to be other than the guy who wants to fuck you
Heart behind the jersey
Scarred behind the Mercy
Card me, I ain't worthy
Hard to find who hurt me
Are you trying to murk me?
Hard replies and Hershey
Started trying to die but then I saw the line was dirty
Jaw defines the curb when we walk to find the dog who birthed me
Y'all can find me hurting in the dark till I am thirty
Growing as a man in a planet of them
Them are women, so to them I'm just him

[Hook]
I can't stand Him
It's Him again
But I am Him
The then again
I know you don't want to answer your phone
But I'm coming up under this blanket

[Verse Two: Charles Hamilton]
Rated with an X, praying for some sex
Praying to execs, laying for a check
Maybe I am blessed
Make me sign my death
Wish and certificate when I say why I am stressed
Labels put a head so my day to day
Of finding records saying what I display
When I wake up in a sweat
Crazy as it gets, babies sending texts
I say to them, "I guess."
They make it even less hatred in my flesh
Raped and given neck
Make it such a mess
Greater than the rest
A Laker with a tech
Rafer with the best
Favors for the West
Naked with the refs
Nader with the message
Fader with the Rep
Ladies getting wet
Awake because of death
Growing as a man in a planet of them
Them are women, so to them I'm just Him

[Hook]

[Bridge x2]
One minute I'm fine and at one-minute-and-one I feel nothing
Why must this continue
Why come back and let you know
How it feels to be Mr. I Told You So

[Hook]
