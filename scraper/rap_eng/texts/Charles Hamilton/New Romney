[Intro]
Early
A little too early
Ahead of my time

[Verse 1]
So the matter at hand was pro-choice
No y'all niggas got no choice
Jay-Z style, leave you with no voice
I'll be the king even with no hoist
Even with no boys, even with no voice
Damn, sounding mighty republican
And if I really fucked with your man
And the man the man who's fucking with the land
I probably be the guy in the
W-H-I-T-E House
But no
You ain't got no mouth
Ever since you put your ballot up
Who you marrying? What the fuck?
This is not a game, it's your life
But the game is life and I'm gaining life
I'm the gangster of life
And it's dangerous, I'm white
And you already know what my name is, right?

[Hook]
I decide what you believe
But you decide what you believe
Doesn't matter what you believe
Because I decide what you believe
New Romney (Do it)
New Romney (Do it)
New Romney (Do it)
New Romney (Do it)
New Romney (Do it)
New Romney (Do it)
New Romney (Do it)
New Romney (Do it)

[Verse 2]
White button-down, red tie, I'm an elephant
When it comes to running niggas lives, I'm a veteran
I don't really fuck if guy is the president
Giver, get the picture, relevant
Everybody saying, "Yo, you should be celibate"
Why?
Cause these bitches getting raped and they telling kids
That your daddy is a bastard, now he's a bastard
And he's the topic of laughter, what a disaster
Living in a country of which I own
But you get my poems with this hip-hop song
From a kid who already knows what you think
So his poems are deep and you so think the pink
Just another meaning, a different type of reflection
But when you see the red within
You will say, "He's your best friend"
Then he just exits, I be the best friend
You need to exit the pose, motherfuckers

[Hook]
I decide what you believe
But you decide what you believe
Doesn't matter what you believe
Because I decide what you believe
New Romney (Do it)
New Romney (Do it)
New Romney (Do it)
New Romney (Do it)
New Romney (Do it)
New Romney (Do it)
New Romney (Do it)
New Romney (Do it)

[Verse 3]
I have no swagger, iron fist
Think it's easy being me, go ahead, try this shit
Everybody was crying, dying with their fits
When they all...the world was on some Ryan shit
Well Ryan, you can be my VP
So I can make being me look easy
It's a rush now, isn't it?
Lust is a benefit
You ain't got the kid by choice, get rid of it
But not in this country of which I run
Don't make me have to get my gun
Don't make me have to get my son
Don't make me have to get my one
She's blonde and her hair's kind of short
Which means she gonna be here for longer
Than the hair of the sport
The sport is politics and who's in your hair
Another Hussein, but who's saying, who's running this shit, who's playing

[Hook]
I decide what you believe
But you decide what you believe
Doesn't matter what you believe
Because I decide what you believe
New Romney (Do it)
New Romney (Do it)
New Romney (Do it)
New Romney (Do it)
New Romney (Do it)
New Romney (Do it)
New Romney (Do it)
New Romney (Do it)
