[Verse 1]
I've been fighting sleep saying prayers for the lost
I care for the law but I ain't careful at all
I wanna confess to every sin I committed
But I'm tryna be a rebel so give me a minute
Really I get it. Your fear for the misunderstood
Gives you the right to attack. It's understood
But to get that, get this. Decisions to make
Picture your fate and don't give it away
I'm sitting in place and standing my ground
Which is a disgrace to the planet I found
Can I be down? I want nothing more than to fit in
Forced into living but my course wasn't written
I'm growing past holding cash, knowing when to clash
Glowing from the past. Show me where it's at
Something's coming but my vision is cloudy
Here I am fixing to doubt me

[Hook]
Every time I think I got it figured out I run and yell
So you know I hate it when I'm wrong
So if ever I'm Correct I really hope you wish me well
Maybe this is more than just a song

[Verse 2]
I know why cops are shooting black men
We were raised to be threats, but I'm asking
Where does the change begin, at home or the precinct?
I stay alone being decent
I punched a cop, knowing I would lose my freedom
I let journalists choose a reason
But since then, the cops blacking out has been senseless
Unless you wanna have a talk about its senses
The strongest race is defense-less
Hanging onto Azealia Banks sentences
Forget it, we've been in the wrong for a minute
If Jesus was black that would explain the limit
I find freedom and they tell me i'm a gimmick
I blind treason and they tell me I don't get it
I'm sleeping with demons despite satan
Quite blatant, can I make it?

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Isis might attack America next
You're welcome, since I decided to share what is next
Rappers got guns that'll tear up your vest
Flare up your flesh, Rats just want to stare when it's wet
I'm ashamed to go to God but the devil's dumb
I got answers but yo, I'm forever numb
Better than some, but my head is a gun
Put a gun to my head and let the lead run
All I think about is white wine and redrum
Because when I smile the feds come
I sin too often to ever grin and walk
So God, please make an exception
I pray for St. Louis and the poverty block's of the world
I pray for women with their honesty locked in their curls
If my prayers count then I dare doubt
A good night's sleep is all I care about

[Hook]
