[Verse 1:]
Yo, where my neighbors at from the left to the right?
I'm the illest neighbor that step to the mic
These neighbors ain't ready for the mess that I write
So I'll call you niggas neighbors for the rest of the night
You close to me, but only geographically
So I dare one of you neighbors to come battle me
Neighbor please, I was sick with ill shit
I bring home improvement like Mr. Wilson
At least in the music sense, can't see me little neighbor
So move the fence, dense-
Is how I describe you neighbors
Your facts don't add up, I'll divide you neighbors
I know where to find you neighbors
And I'll die for my neighbors when I'm high from vapors
And that don't mean that I'm soft when I'm sober
'cuz real neighbors know that Charles is a soldier

[Hook:]
Did you hear what he said?
What goes on in his head?
He got a lot of time on his hands
"I simply respond I am a man"
Turn it up a little bit
Turn it up a little bit
(Please won't you be- please won't you be- my neighbor)

[Verse 2:]
Most of you neighbors is wack
Gettin' paper from rap 'cuz what you say on the track is as plain as a fact
Aight, whatever, but I'mma be livin' the rebel life forever
I hate my neighbors like I live next to a convicted sex offender
You best remember
I'm 21, 11-10-08, so I keep a deuce-deuce like next November
So clap all you neighbors, Hi neighbor!
Zone out like a bunch of high neighbors
You see me? Hi neighbors!
I live life like God is my neighbor
Stay comin' off the top like fly paper
A bold thought got managed by a violator
I'm fuckin' busy right now, try later
You don't like it then go ahead and die neighbor

[Hook:]
Did you hear what he said?
What goes on in his head?
He got a lot of time on his hands
"I simply respond I am a man"
Turn it up a little bit
Turn it up a little bit
(Please won't you be- please won't you be- my neighbor)

[Verse 3:]
Am I try'na get rid of "nigga"?
Nah, I'm just try'na get rid of niggas
I'm sick of niggas like I'm the white family when Vivian and Phil moved in the city for real
It got worse when some hood neighbor moved in
But it's not neighborish for me to shoot them
But it IS neighborish for me to shoot them
NBC, nothin' but neighbors
Charles Hamilton, nothin' but paper
Go online and see nothing but haters
See some old friends, they want nothin' but favors
I got too much to lose, I'll fuck 'em up later
(My neighbor) told me to kill 'em with kindness
So I'll kill myself and let you visit where I live
(Please won't you be- please won't you be- my neighbor)

[Hook:]
Did you hear what he said?
What goes on in his head?
He got a lot of time on his hands
"I simply respond I am a man"
Turn it up a little bit
Turn it up a little bit
(Please won't you be- please won't you be- my neighbor)

[Outro: Mister Rogers]
Are you a boy or a girl?
I used to think you got born and then turned into a boy or a girl
But now I know that if you're a boy, you were born a boy
And if you're a girl, you were born a girl
You're just the way you're supposed to be
You're growing just...
