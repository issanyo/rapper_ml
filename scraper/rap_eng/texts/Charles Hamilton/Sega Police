[Intro]
Oh boy, turn it up some

[Verse 1]
So I'm back with a beat that makes no sense
I got no sense, but the flow's sick
If you know this broken shit
Then you know you've been attacked by the no sense twins
Me and the beat, still ain't got no sense
Oh shit, read it and weep
Imma bounce in the bounce, more bounce to the ounce
Bring em out cause they down for the count and I'm out
Got an issue with women, which one should I choose first?
The two flirts or the one with the blue purse
Two words: Sonic Orgy
No blue balls, you got it shawty
And I'm coasting, got em open
I'm an no kin, Bobby's throat is what I'm hoping for, oh shit
So much for me rapping with no sense

[Hook]
Just bounce to the biggy biggy bounce
The biggy biggy bounce
The biggy biggy bounce

Step out, show me what you all about
Pull your g- string down south, ow

[Verse 2]
And you're rocking with Hugh Hefner the Hedgehog
Got you girl working out her mouth, making her hedge hog
No beat, I ain't gotta make her head nod
To make her head nod, face full of eggnog
My bad, I'm bad like not good
I'm circumcised, I am not hood
But I got hood, starlight zone
Life's a bitch, I poke her and y'all might fall
I'm the motherfucking sun and y'all nice so...
Bye bye bitches, y'all in my zone
Cause I gotta zone on my own
If you wanna talk, you can all my phone
I don't wanna talk, I wanna run
Straight the tele, cause I wanna cum
All over these drums like....

It's Charles Hamilton

[Hook/Outro]
Just listen to me
Welcome to the LAMALAMP ZONE(x16)

Charles Hamilton, uptown
Just dancing, I see you Nate
Ah! This shit is stupid, whoo!

LAVALAMP ZONE(x8)
Welcome to the LAMALAMP ZONE(x8)

Just bounce to the biggy biggy bounce
The biggy biggy bounce
The biggy biggy bounce

Step out, show me what you all about
Pull your g- string down south, ow(x4)
