[Chorus]
Baby take a load off, rest your body
Get your mind in here and so lost
Cause the minute that you take all of them clothes off
We gonna travel into space until you doze off

[Verse 1]
I ain't crazy baby, I don't need no Zoloft
But the bed is like a stage and I'ma show off
Just like our love, it's gotta have a slow start
But you a grown-up, so you like it so hard
That you can feel it in your stomach in the morning
You already know nothing I do is boring
This ain't a game, so I don't care about scoring
I just wanna be the reason you're snoring
Sleep tight baby, it's deep right baby?
I know you got a boyfriend, and he's tight crazy
For leaving you with your favorite addiction
That you didn't even know was your favorite, so listen

[Chorus]
Baby take a load off, rest your body
Get your mind in here and so lost
Cause the minute that you take all of them clothes off
We gonna travel into space til you doze off
(I wanna touch you right there, I wanna kiss you right there)

[Verse 2]
I envision you in your swimwear
Not the kinda sleezy shit that Lil Kim wears
I mean the kind that make me lift you up in midair
And have your essence all over my chin hair
I know you like it, so I do it til your legs shake
I know you like it, so I do it til the bed breaks
You know I like it, so you do it til my toes curl
You know I like it when I grunt and say 'Oh girl'
You ain't gotta be my wifey
For me to drop to one knee for you nightly
And I ain't gotta keep you icey
For you to see what this relationship might be
See I'm sick of being told what not to do
So that's exactly what I got to do
You can't find nobody better to treat you
But I gotta go baby, it was a pleasure to meet you

[Chorus]
Baby take a load off, rest your body
Get your mind in here and so lost
Cause the minute that you take all of them clothes off
We gonna travel into space til you doze off
