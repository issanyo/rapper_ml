Hustle hard
Money Stack
Sell that dope
Sell that crack
Sell that pat
Sell that gat
Sell that pussy
Holla back x4

[Verse: Charles Hamilton]
I wanna get it on the first date
Soon as you meet me, i can let you call me skirt face
I got Merch mad at me, cause my Merch ain't
Meer Merchandise, i work with fate
I see it coming and i do a merry melody
Lookin looney but sue me, im feelin heavenly
The letter C, taught to never believe
Met her by the Sea, let her try to read
Stepping out, with the royal mirrage
Noise in her pocket, she's enjoying massages
Toying with the cops when in hoist in someones locks
And foiling the options of joining any mob
Now Boisterously silent, how we rollin
You already know about the dough we holdin
It ain't hard to get a hood chick open
Stay focused, keep ya game potent
Lost a lot of allies, walked a lot of alleys
Dream of mountains, peaks and valleys
So many people at me, i am trending
Enjoyin weed, and speed in a taxi
Life, breeze and past me
Get a job, get a career, live odd
Then at the end of the year, thank god for continue living
I'm selling beats y'all, illest sound in the streets y'all
Bang ya head like a retard
At the movies eating sweetarts, with my sweetheart
Stolen kisses every week y'all, sweeter moments everyday y'all
She got street smarts, and a deep heart
We just met, and we are, but we don't love together
I live with a latch door, my only room mate
The Blogger Dashboard, Therefore...

[Outro: Charles Hamilton]
And i don't have no ads on my blog either
Only money i get is y'all comments, pay up
I don't give a fuck who run blogger
Y'all already know
Segahamilton.blogspot.com one time
Y'all can find me other places on the web but
Y'all can't hear me talk
Every Interview yo i keep it
I keep it so many stacks in every interview
Every Article...
I dont even get mad when they misquote me or
They take my words out of context no more
I clean my shit up on my blog
And i don't even have to clean it up
So y'all can keep it 100 man
I keep it western union, ha
Professor Francis, if you will
