[Verse 1]
Maybe I was born to the part
From the place I was born from the start (Damn)
But since it all formed from the heart
Where else is the scorn in my heart? (Veins)
So many people I could blame, but I'm still me
The reason I'm insane, you feel me?
The real me could fuck all of you niggas up
Cause I don't give a fuck, I'm used to gettin cut
I'm used to gettin stabbed, cause I'm my own bully
Because my soul is somethin that I don't own fully
I fucking share with these non-deserving
Constantly irking my fucking nerves person
And put an S in parenthesis
When I'm alone, I'm the best in the industry
Go online, I'm a mess in the industry
Hated on by cats that are stressed by the industry

[Hook]
Nothing should be bothering me
But it all does, but it all does
Shadows in the dark keep following me
But it's all love, but it's all love
Life keeps asking so many questions
Life keeps asking so many questions
Why.. so many questions
Life keeps asking so many questions.. Why?

[Verse 2]
Sometimes I do it like I do it for the love again
God is a woman, if not, it's for the love of Him
So what's a sin? Having a public grin?
Or kiss so much ass that there's shit on your fucking chin?
In this game I ain't got no f---in friends
Half the n----- is ----- and they ain't got no f-ckin sense
And I'm a f-ckin infant, I ain't been f---in since
Every ----- ----- I wanna ---- wants some f-ckin cents
Fuck cents, they want a couple jints
On some f-ckin trees, that are the color of mint
And the same ------ I'm talkin about f-ckin miss
Then I said if it weren't for my cash, they wouldn't touch my ----
Even with their eyes, so I leave them with their lies
Go home, Google your pics, say "good evening" with a sigh
Mine talk to you
My I ------- hate you..

[Hook]
Nothing should be bothering me
But it all does, but it all does
Shadows in the dark keep following me
But it's all love, but it's all love
Life keeps asking so many questions
Life keeps asking so many questions
Why.. so many questions
Life keeps asking so many questions.. Why?

[Verse 3]
Right before we had our first encounter
I got a phone call and it hurts to counter
An innocent question by one of your homies
"Can you loan me some money?"
Well no, cause you know they're gonna be actin funny
But fuck it, I lent it..
You see me, the Harlm Genie
Believe me, I'm sick of grantin' wishes
I wanna be a house husband.. dishes..
Cooking you food, delicious..
Stupid bitches wanna get through from witches
I give you the business, hot shit
Give these bitches a stock tip
You're talking like you my girl, but you're not shit
Where is Nivea, I need to get some top quick
Purple kisses, a dream come true
But nowadays you get sued over pre-cum
So it's quiet like three drums
Without anyone to beat one
We will just be one

Nothing should be bothering me
But it all does, but it all does

Life keeps asking so many questions
Life keeps asking so many questions

Life keeps asking so many questions.. Why?
