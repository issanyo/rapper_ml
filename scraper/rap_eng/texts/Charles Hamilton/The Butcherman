[Verse 1] (Charles Hamilton)

I just got an opinion, I ain't' tryna black
But I said a nigga name, and he tryna clap
He tryna scrap, meantime I just rhyme the facts
It doesnt matter I'm scared and I ain't tryna rap
Keep lookin' behind my back, is this nigga near?
Everybody's a spy, even the engineer
Shit is clear, I should've chilled when I had the chance
Now I'm gettin' approached by all these rappers' fans
"How you diss him and thought that you would be cool homie?
You'll be lucky if he don't pull out the tool homie
Who are you homie? Some new nigga...
Who ain't got nothin' to do nigga, I can't fool with you
You new in this picture, you get chewed in this picture
Too many niggas know where you livin' and usin' pistols
Sleep with one eye open, be scared nigga
No matter where you go, we here nigga"


[Hook]
Watch your mouth when you talk about me
I don't care what you said, man you talkin' bout beef
And I'm the butcherman
I'm the butcherman
I'm the butcherman
I'm the butcherman


[Verse 2] (Charles Hamilton)

Aw man...
I got a wife and a kid on the way
So if it's today I get hit with a K, then she's pissed at my ways
But I got a fuckin' image to uphold
Niggas wanna blow my motherfuckin' liver through my soul
I ain't' tryna have niggas at my Do', Six O' Fo' in the mornin' like
(Knock)(x5)
I can't even enjoy my fuckin' breakfast nigga
So much for me listenin' to this reckless nigga, What


[Verse 3] (Yung Nate)

Chuck I ain't' lookin' for beef, cause I ain't got the time
That's why i keep niggas with me, they ain't gotta grind
You gotta Sick Scene, and they got a Nine
You reppin' yo coast, they reppin' homicide
Word to my mama, I'm really a mellow kinda guy
But these niggas is food in this evening, durin' Ramadan
So watch me eat, the majority of the industry
With just a little microphone, paperbag been in me
Fuck sayin' this is my year, this my whole fuckin' century
I'm everything you like, I'm a livin breathin' simile
The funny thing about liken', is that some nigga pretend to be
So remember when you see me, y'all motherfuckers ain't friends of me
I seen some of ya'll in person, them niggas finicky
Guards by the bathroom, too scared to take a leak
Expose in the game, Now everybody take a peek(look inside nigga!)
Hahaha, the fuck they gonna say to me

[Hook x2]
