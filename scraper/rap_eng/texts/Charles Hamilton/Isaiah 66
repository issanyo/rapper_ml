Truth is I'm nicer than everyone
So I just decided I'll be nicer to everyone
My mind is the sight of the blind minus the blindness
Don't try to deny it, i am the highest in this climate
My touch midas
Retire when? try again
The Hamilton language doesn't define what retirement
I am grin, so mean mug away
I get resoprosity, the mean fuckin way
I said fuck it, see what I say
Even when cussing I mean what I say
Seeing that it takes a scene from a great screenplay
To make people believe today
Ok, bet turn it up a notch
Learning what to watch when you're in a couple knots
Murder love the cops
Cops love justice, not just fussing
Look at the..
Man everything ain't looking the same
Open up my book to explain how I shook up the game
My aim
Got a whole list full of buddies
Just like me whole fist full of duckets
So while you sit there pissed looking fuck it
I get pink and you get pulled in the bucket
Full but I'm stuffing
No I'm not greedy
I live inside these turkeys, you can't see me
You should not be the dude who tries to delete me
Ride through "beep,beep" you die houdini
Move by the swoop my sweetie
I do not trust, I watch
I trust my sight, Professor X meets Cyclops
Why not, why stop?
I got little to no love on my block
But they who I was, know who I am
Using my buzz trying to carve my notch in this...
Friends saying that I'm insane
But to them, it's a big game
So I spit lame
F in the front, god's gotta high box
So I step in it once
Never been dunced
Or redundant
I'm a rebel
And my criminal record is in conjunction....Charles Hamilton!
Y'all n1ggas want something
