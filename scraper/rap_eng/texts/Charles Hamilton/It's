[Intro]
Eric: Hello world, my name is Eric Rosenthal
Jeff: And I'm Jeff Rosenthal. And together we run itsthereal.com
Eric: We run our website a little better than Yung Berg runs Detroit
Which is to say we actually run our website
Jeff: Speaking on that, for all you snitches out there wondering what
The hell these two idiots are doing hosting a mixtape
Eric: Shouts to mom and dad
Jeff: Then snitch away. Run and tell everyone you know. Police, CO's
Fed's, Cam'Ron, Rudy Gulliani, that It's Charles Hamilton is about to
Go down
Eric: Way down, downhill
Jeff: Well just the parts where Charles raps really

Charles: Make sure my mic is loud and my production is right. Production is tight

[Verse 1]
I won't lose, that is not an option
Rap is not a job, I gotta rap to stop the nonsense
In my conscience, that is not me jotting
I swear I got a rock in my pocket, the shit that I be dropping
Straight crack, got rockers boppin'
Great rap, got hip-hoppers moshing, knowledge dropping
Like your brains gettin' splashed on the curb
I rap for the 'burbs and them cats flipping birds
This is my mission statement, I've been the greatest
Since the greatest 6, when I was pencil breaking, wishing for greatness
The latest statements from the greats is
"Nowadays, I'm diesel like sour haze"
Dope fitters dropping the illest shit
If it is something you don't get, then you are ignorant
Like Mike Jackson in that episode of South Park
Ain't shit funny, you don't know shit about Charles

[Hook]
It's Charles Hamilton
C-H-A-R, spittin like an AR
It's Charles Hamilton
It's Charles Hamilton
C-H-A-R, spittin like an AR
It's Charles Hamilton

[Verse 2]
My theories go serial, killer through your strereo
Here we go, nobody is near me yo, fear the flow
Here we go, clearly thro-u-g-h
Ya motherfucking balance, and I don't mean PH
T-H-E-O, gave my tape to 3H
Since then PH-arell, and Jimmy makes
Three great people who say CH is the latest
Something, something, something spaceship
Since outer space candor is considered great candor
I'm the Planet of the Apes, but with great manners
Fuck outta my face cocksucker, please
A lot of these niggas got cocksucker disease
They popped up on TV because they propped up on their kness
And cocked up their knees for lots of the cheese
I'm a monster, believe
Blanca, the opposite of blanco
I decided to out fox you like Solange Knowles, whoa

[Hook]
It's Charles Hamilton
C-H-A-R, spittin like an AR
It's Charles Hamilton
It's Charles Hamilton
C-H-A-R, spittin like an AR
It's Charles Hamilton

[Verse 3]
The pop culture rebel, say what you need to say
Most of you niggas is washed up like the VMA's
The nominees for best rapper of the year
Doesn't even matter because I'm here, it's clear, yeah
The blogger from Harlem is a problem
Put your L's in the air, I see the big picture starring
Charles, the most well fed starving artist
Marvin knows what going on cause I brought him along to
Hum in your mind while you listen
You don't hear him, but he's all in my rhymes when I'm spitting
Bring peace in this time of unrest
Seduction to a beat, see it's time to undress
I am one mess of a kid, no bounty
On my head, when I was dead, God found me
And she crowned me King of the Underground
So it's a celebration thing when I come around

[Hook]
It's Charles Hamilton
C-H-A-R, spittin like an AR
It's Charles Hamilton
(The one and only)
It's Charles Hamilton
C-H-A-R, spittin like an AR
It's Charles Hamilton
(And I'm only 20)

[Outro]
Rest in peace Big L. Shoutout to Primo, but you know who did this beat

Eric: You know our living situation has been kind of a mess ever since
Charles moved into the It'sTheReal.com bunker
Jeff; Yea, the kid thinks he runs the place. Sega games on the TV
Hard rock on the stereo
Eric: Yea, we used to have culture
Jeff: We used to discuss politics
Eric: You know what the worst thing of living with Charles is?
Probably how he painted..
Eric and Jeff: THE WALLS PINK!
Jeff: Right, yea, it looks like we're living inside a vagina
Eric: Y'know maybe we should call our apartment the Sarah Pal-inn. Anyone? Sure
