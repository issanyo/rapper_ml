[Intro]
Uh, From my understanding
I got some important things, need to be tended to
Yo!

[Verse 1]
I broke the bond with my words
My balls will have to suffice
Call a cab to the mic, destination: Segregation
Heaven waiting for the saliva of the 7th seal
Being fake for all the times I kept it real
Dreading the appeal to head to the heels for court
Arrested, the court overruled my quotables
Cool to quote, then dove in a pool of molten fluid
Scolding my view, frozen, broke it
You-know-who is smoking
Folgers brewing in my vocals, awake but not conscious
Break the pot of gold, rainbows hate snow
Freeze the golden pot and throw it on the stove top
Proud of all the things I could say that I don't got
Allowed to call me king but I play as a broke cop
Just hugging the block like an orphan streetlight
Gorgeous ogre, more than a fetus, I know, I seem tight
But what to do when you threw yourself into mistrust
I prove myself my wishes for help is useless
Fall into the sewer to skewer
All of the truth being mathematically disproven
The shit's stupid, get approvals for the whispers on my pics
Hiss em until the beauty vixens in the mix
Mixing the beauty with feudal because it fits
Frugal but brutal when cooling it
Night sky looking blue and shit
Morning view is pretty sick too
The hue of hooligans who have invented a new sense of screwing with the news
Futuristic graffiti, its easy to be uneasy
And that was so tough, I bullied the next couple quotes
Less trouble when you pop a bubble coat
Huddle up and keep it hot in my chest as a water cooler
I spit fire, why the fuck I even bought a cooler
The Pro-Tools dolphin, knee deep
Manipulate the waves, go surfing like "Beach Please!"
Make the beat swallow the salt
Assume that this is the hottest assault on the track
I hope on the corpse and chat
But what about human contact?
The nuisance, I'm that
Truer than live spat
You know when I'm lying cause my lips are moving
But I'm nodding my head like "Yo,This shit is stupid"
What's next?

[Hook]
I think I might've changed the world today
Because I feel like it
Because I feel like it

I think I might've changed the world today
Because I feel like it
Because I feel like it

[Verse 2]
Any female is a potential penciling
Hence the grin when saying "Are we trying this relationship again?"
The sun in the 70's, hot, free love
Popping 3's like a Ramen dream
Cause on the real, I'm better off working in the paint
I rebound with art, while smirking in your face
The most important insubordinate orcan employee
Boys that annoy me make me employee of the month
Enjoy me while I front
Such a liar that nothing spoils my blood
Foil the underhanded ploys of who want what?
You drunk fuck my Jack Daniels glass box
Standing mad sharp but the target of mad glances
Bitch gave me a heart and mad chances
I gave her hollow walls and made her feel like she got backhanded
The truth? Another chick
But I gave her a whack answer
Past being damned, I'm happy I'm the man
Mankind is abrasive
I'm a kind man abrasively refined
I can erase what you define
Until the original definition is worth expressing
Perplexing, but a per-plus generation is depressing
To fit in I get brainwashed with you
It ain't all an issue, I paintball kiss you
Am I wrong cause I play lost with you?
Thank you

[Hook]
I think I might've changed the world today
Because I feel like it
Because I feel like it

I think I might've changed the world today
Because I feel like it
Because I feel like it

Because I feel like it
