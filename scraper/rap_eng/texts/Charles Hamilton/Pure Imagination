[Verse I]
Imagine dozin off in my arms to the scent of chocolate and an Incubus song
You feel free you ain't got much on
I feel free so I'm comin' on strong
But I'm not tryna to climb inside you
I just wanna be in your mind to guide you
You don't see the beauty in your eyes but I do
The diamonds in your eyes don't lie you shine boo
And need I remind you that I do shine too
And I do find you divinely insightful
You said you weren't on the same page as me
But your lips and your eyes say you're cravin' me
If it goes down what would he say to me?
And even if it doesn't what would they believe?
Just relax here and lay with me
Spend a day with me
Here in make believe

[Hook]
Come with me
And you'll be
In a world of Pure imagination
Take a look and you'll see
Into your imagination

It begins
With a spin traveling
In a world of my creation
What you'll see will defy
Explanation

[Verse II]
I live in my world I play by my rules
I live by a chocolate lake that I use
With strawberry fish I make it my pool
Climb on top of the gate and dive to
The bottom of the flavor savor my truth
Mr. Right is here, Mr. Wrong just left
Which only leaves Mr. Right, don't be down and upset
You down to set up a situation
That will never mess up or get impatient
It ain't all about me getting laid
It's the way we kiss that makes me flip, I savor it
Your kiss is true, this is true
But you think it feels wrong, but this is new
All I got is this world that I give to you
Look at relationships from a different view
As you can see, this here's for you so...

[Hook]

[Verse III]
I shed so many tears in this factory
Cause it does get lonely in here
Even when I got my homies in here
They only my peers, I need a girl to hold me in here
The window of hope that's supposed to be clear
Got broken like my heart
I know you can hear the sincerity and clarity, you know I'm sincere
But just like my chocolate, I don't need to smear
So take me in girl, indulge in me
We can be everything that we can grow to be
Look at how long it took for you to notice me
Just hold me tight like a rosarie
I can't create candy without a little sweetness
My weakness, something that I can cake up
But even if you decide to leave
You still gonna smell chocolate when you wake up

[Hook x2]
