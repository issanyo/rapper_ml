[Verse 1]
Romeo and Juilet
Only difference we haven't even shot a movie yet
And I can truly bet thats shes never been to my world
Shes Vada still wishing she was my girl
I would be Macaulay but I hate bee stings
Stay awake and pay attention when she sings
She got the kind of affection I been seaking
I can borrow her heart love is for keeping
I feel bad that I put her love on lay-away
But that way it won't be hard to stay away
We both no the restrictions but on naked days
We stay awake and watch cartoon and play a game
Called this isn't wrong but it feels strange
I don't ever wanna fell the same
The absence of melanin fells better when
Heaven lets sin be my medicine

[Hook]
I got that fever I don't even know if I need her I wanna see her
Welcome to the jungle (4 x)
It's not about color she might be the right kind of lover Charzan and Jane
Welcome to the jungle (4 x)
White girl love

[Verse 2]
She's into watching old movies and eating salad
Mad rage mad love uneven balance
She gets heckled in Harlem how can she even manage
Why ask how her breathing is a talent
I can't even see a reason to be sad
Only when we fight and I'm leaving the pad heated
She gets mad when I creep in late
Only cause she thinks I'm embarrassed cause of her race
Yeah right I'll carry you through the race
I even said I love to marry you to your face
And the world saw it, half of it was arrogance
I got pride cause I'm African American
Call the love police and turn me in
She not white I say shes katevirdian
It's a white girl demeanor that lures me in
Jungle fever the city what cures me

[Hook]
I got that fever I don't even know if I need her I wanna see her
Welcome to the jungle (4 x)
It's not about color she might be the right kind of lover Charzan and Jane
Welcome to the jungle (4 x)
White girl love

Misunderstood I know you fell me
Tell me you love me white girl
Tell me you love me white girl
Tell me you love

I'm feeling good you know the real me
Tell me you love me white girl
Tell me you love me white girl

White girl fever
Got that white girl fever (9 x)

[Hook (2x)]
I got that fever I don't even know if I need her I wanna see her
Welcome to the jungle (4 x)
It's not about color she might be the right kind of lover Charzan and Jane
Welcome to the jungle (4 x)
White girl love, Stacy
