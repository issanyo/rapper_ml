[Intro]
Uh, watch your step

[Verse 1]
I wish you could see what I see
Be what I be
Breathe what I breathe
The ether I speak doesn't need a hot beat
But the rhythm of the instruments mean I got free translation
You and ya man hatin?
Brings me closer to the truth
You are the man Satin
Too bad I'm too other-worldy to be a man
But I'm a man in all context, believe in man
More human than human Rob Zombie
Unplugged from the matrix, you cannot find me
I left the hand I write with, write what's left in my right hand
Therefore you cannot sign me
I remember how I used to rock blindly
But move the blind is no dude can outshine me
Finally, I done came into my home
I'm already the king, I'm just waiting for the throne

[Hook]
And all I ask is that you order my steps
Even if it means I gotta order my steps
Just tell me where to order it from, and I'll invest in it
I gotta home more high, so I rest in it(x2)

[Verse 2]
See I'm about to put out an album that's ahead of it's time
Or head of it's time, ya album ain't better than mine
I spit out spears, you Kevin Feder with lines
Competitive times don't call for repetitive rhymes
I'm clever I'm fine And I'm getting better with time
You should back out, back up, or severe your spine
And I won't do federal time, they papercuts
I threw my rhyme book dead at your spine
So you fuckin right I'm cocky Why? Cause God got me Got me
The rest of you niggas should just watch me
I'm spitting a lyrical Glock gettin it popped And ya bitch want change like Vivica Fox
Y'all got ghost writers, so being behind bars Is nothin to you bitches, just prison of foxy heh
So don't say shit if you had good sense
You just a mere grain of sand in my footprints

[Hook]
And all I ask is that you order my steps
Even if it means I gotta order my steps
Just tell me where to order it from, and I'll invest in it
I gotta home more high, so I rest in it(x2)

[Verse 3]
Still got the Devil on speed dial
So it ain't nothin for me to press redial
But if I do that, then I might as well be down with him
But it's his world, why be down with him When this world faces his judgement
I swear I'm the face of the public
Saying god these are my people
Though I can't lie, some of my people are evil, they shouldn't die evil
We can change em God, you and me both
He told me be Noah, let music be the boat
So you will be slow if you didn't listen
I know you feel something different when you niggas listen
It ain't just all about the shit I spin
I'm tryna show y'all that the little kid was given
From uptown, litteraly did you get it?
Probably not, and that's why I gotta be watched, come on

[Hook]
And all I ask is that you order my steps
Even if it means I gotta order my steps
Just tell me where to order it from, and I'll invest in it
