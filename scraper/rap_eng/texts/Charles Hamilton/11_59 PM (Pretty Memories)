[Verse 1]:
Haunted by the voices, taunted by the choices
Haunted by the poison but I'm on it never moistened
High off the wet, fly from the jet fumes
Sky never met dude, outta my mind
Only time I felt fine is when I vibe with
The guy from the Neptunes, my pH balance is real
No secret, mainstream says we hate talent and skills
So how the hell I capture this deal?
I happen to feel kinda down about shit
How would people feel if they found out about this
Round of depression fuck I been down for a second
60, minute, get me?
Which sucks cause I really wanna smile
Spirit of the city as a child... now that's wild
The city never sleeps right?
So what the hell do I do each night?
Stay up and remember

[Hook]:
(All those pretty memories)
All I can do is remember
Never far from the truth I remember
To make the future feel better
Oxymoron like the future will never
Every second can move you close to the future
So the future is forever, remember.. remember

[Verse 2]:
I remember sleeping on the phone while speaking to Nakeia
And I wasn't beating it either
Did a mixtape I told her to roast me
Not OD and greet me with the ether
I look back and think maybe she was telling the truth
I was her sucker, her personal irrelevant fool
Some messages never get through
Until you let loose and just rest in the blues
First time I held a gun I felt like a greedy king
Real bullets man I was not a bb king
But I had the blues I was in a jam
Literally cocked back and the trigger jammed
Karma saw it and hit me with a bigger blam
Success, now I'm that nigga man
Go figure damn, even the river ran
When I planned on how I can be a different man
Cuz it knew that the flow was gonna black
The river runs blue and its over for that
Nothings bluer than the spikes hanging over my back
Build my own walls, hopping over and back
Bumping the pink lavalamp while im drinking a latte
**Love is a gope I write what I do not say
But I remember how hard it was
For Charles to love having Charles' buzz
Thanks to all the drugs, the broads I fucked
The so called thugs that robbed and mugged me
Autumn is lovely, especially with all this bubbly
Awesome they all just love me!
I think as my face scans the crowd
I shake hands and bow
Waiting for the hate from a man in the crowd
Either he doesn't get it, must have missed it or is just a hater
Suck a dizzick, I tell 'em mind they fucking business
I just sleep but I don't sleep I just remembered

[Hook]
