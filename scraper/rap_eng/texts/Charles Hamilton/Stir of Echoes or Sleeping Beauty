[Verse 1]
Yesterday I walked around for miles
Saw the silhouette of what I thought could be you
Couldn't help but stop my stride and crack a smile
What if all my blurry-eyed halucinations really were true?
Doesn't seem to me that my dreams I see
Cause the lack of peace ain't the enemy
But I dream to be, cause it's within my reach
So why don't I help myself relentlessly
To any other tears that draw my eyes
Be the reason I was it, why, and I am alive
Could you show me dear something I've not seen
Something infinitely interesting
Could you show me dear something I've not seen
Something infinitely interesting

[Verse 2]
You remember as it fades, gaze
But when it walks away from you
Only ugly flashbacks stay
I wish I could put an actual human to a place
That face I see when I space
And transmit my statements to music
Foolish to believe something that I have conceived
Would even exist and love me the way I loved she
'What does she want?' I ask as I write a checklist
On her I could be the best fit
I guess the other game's Tetris
But this is faster
If I ask her to tell me the truth
Will the response be a disaster?
After such questions I have to rest
Cause what's after this?

Could you show me dear something I've not seen
Something infinitely interesting
Could you show me dear something I've not seen
Something infinitely interesting

Could you show me dear something I've not seen
Something infinitely interesting
Could you show me dear something I've not seen
Something infinitely interesting

Could you show me dear something I've not seen
Something infinitely interesting
Could you show me dear something I've not seen
Something infinitely interesting
