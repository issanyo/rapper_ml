[Verse 1]
Ayo I rap like I'm rich
Act like I'm shit
Grab a mic to give a Satellite dish Arthritis
Rather an iCyst when I spit
I insist get off my diction
I enunciate, articulate
Demonstrate while y'all can't get it straight
My overseas chick says she coming to America. You know what that means, "IN THE FACE!"
Dont follow my rules you will get replaced
No remorse, leave a bitch on the Interstate
But I'm a gentlemen, well a little bit
Intimate wit bitches wit women a little kid (haha)
Cuz I can, I mean Its funny to
Psychology in reverse 'Dat what honeys do

[Hook]
Girl you make me sick, I swear I'm tired of you
You don't show no respect to what I'm tryna do
But...
It don't matter
It don't matter
It don't matter
Nahhh

[Verse 2]
A la la la la la la lalala la
(chuck, where you at nigga)(YO!)(Wake Up Wake Up)
Huh? What? oh, START THE VERSE!
I'm on the web so much I get on Parker's nerves
No car to swerve, I pardon her ass
Grab the wheel of "Cause a crash"
We all on the curve
The Bubbles to the mic trouble when I write
Sit back like Fuck it 'cuz I'm right
The industry is like life in Gomorrah
Old music the bible so I'm writing a Torah
I'm right before more luck, My life is a force but
Fork on the road, gotta knife for a tour bus
I'm so slow I tour-up a Tortoise
If this song doesn't make sense then It sure does

[Hook]
Girl you make me sick, I swear I'm tired of you
You don't show no respect to what I'm tryna do
But...
It don't matter
It don't matter
It don't matter
Nahhh

[Verse 3]
I don't care how bad you are
You could be from Venus take a cab to the stars
Nice outfit, you sportin' it honey
I wonder, did you get it with the Abortion money?
Oh, you didn't have an Abortion, funny
So I was making shit up, of course, it's funny (haha)
I'm writing this 'cuz I'm bored and hungry
And cranky, niggas should be happy they ain't me
I spend half my time being angry
The Other time Masturbating to Amy
Oh yea I make music, okay 3
Switch but this bitch tried to play me
(Play me)
(Play me)
(Play me)
(Play me)
C.H.X

[Hook]
Girl you make me sick, I swear I'm tired of you
You don't show no respect to what I'm tryna do
But...
