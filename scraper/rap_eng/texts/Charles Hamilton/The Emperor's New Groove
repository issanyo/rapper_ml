I had my own house, had a chick to zone out with. Didn't get catered in any outfit, I had my own outfits. So I'll get so down, niggas trying to out the kid ended up outed. See, my fanbase now, niggas can't take down. I can't wait now but when I look back mad stress in the past. Got a Wesson and a lesson, who want to laugh? Here's a weapon if you niggas dash, meaning skip this track, You get kidnapped by the rhythm. Gotten so nice with the rhythm sometimes get hight to rhythm. See, I changed my ways, my lifestyle's different. Right now I'm feeling like I'm out the pimping game forever. Gotta stay focused. Stay humble stay low like a locust

Can't nobody measure all the shit that I've sacrificed
All the shit that I've sacrificed
I missed out on half my life
Now All I really want is a glass tonight
Can't nobody measure all the shit that I've sacrificed
All the shit that I've sacrificed
I missed out on half my house
Now All I really want is a glass tonight

I'm still tight that I lost my house. I found out what a boss is about. But I had the situation read wrong. Apparently, the game must've had me pegged wrong. But I'm pissing of a name of which I've been wishing a rain with. So I've gotta stay in my lane real quick. But I'm a rebel to the soul so I'll never let 'em know where I'm headed. Unless he's ready to go. At the same time I'm ready to fold. No beef, no drama, in fact. He's got a lot crap to rap from off the cap. The captain of Obama is back. Obama is the shit we've been bombing, in fact. Don't blame race, just say you can't take away the yesterday you had

I learned not to stress women king, so I've got to accept women as blessed gifts. If you get a gift don't toss it away because it's all in your face with obnoxiousness. Wait! Be chill enough to know when you got to go. When it's time to roll don't snuff the hoe. And don't call her a hoe, that'd make her a foe. I'm moving on. I've got newer songs to make, beautiful songs to make. Who's along with the hatred of my past shit, even though they were all classics? I make magic, cats want to make it scientific. I'm dying when I'm spitting, but I'm inside of my living and spitting the illest shit whether it's written or not. Niggas gotta admit that it's hot, now give me a shot
