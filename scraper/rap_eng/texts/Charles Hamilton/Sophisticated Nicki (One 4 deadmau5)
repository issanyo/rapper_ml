[Intro]
Fish and Chips for breakfast
Coors Lite for Lunch

[Verse 1]
Is loving her switch
How she switched from being a hood bitch
To a government snitch
Just a little jab so she could shake her ass
Get mad, come to the pad, I dig in it fast
Missing you nag, you nag cause you want me
And you've been nagging keeping the company of faggots
Come and run with me, Alone Inc
Fuck with me and you won't be lonely
Now write, right, she doesn't write
I love the way she writes, she gets so fucking hyped
Yeah, add a little bit of swag and a little bit of dough
And you're a little bit to brag
Kind of dough I hold, throw it in the Jag
Throw it in the bag, like you're dreaming
And I'm steaming...
More lightning and fire than a dragon steamboat, are you reading

[Hook]
I was getting brain, booty off the chain
But I ain't making love to Nicki
Her booty off the chain and I'm getting brain
But I ain't making love to Nicki
Her booty off the chain and I'm getting brain
But I ain't getting love from Nicki

[Verse 2]
And the thing about Minaj is there's only one
So she can't be an only one
Golf stroke, yeah that's what I got, golf strokes
Feeling on my golf wang, therefore it's a hole in one
Your baby might call me Tyler
Oh my god, yo, call me fire
Charles is a liar, stroking inside of Mariah
All you other Richard Pryors get inspired
Punchline the last past 2012 years
Nicki I could use some help here
3rd eye, did you see that yellow light?
Time to be careful, time to stare at
The chick who gives you an air force airful
The air's full
I like the E, I like strawberries and kiwi
Take her to the island of Wakiki

[Hook]
I was getting brain, booty off the chain
But I ain't making love to Nicki
Booty off the chain and I'm getting brain
But I ain't making love to Nicki
Booty off the chain and I'm getting brain
But I ain't making love to Nicki
And I feel bad

[Verse 3]
Nicki Minaj and 3 nickel bags
Dollar bags, get in the cab
Put her in a cat, supermodels
Check Otis, I am the new Flying Lotus
The dopest, sort of like what Hov is
Except, shit, take notice
Even if I do take over
It's time for me to sober up this bitch
Nicki, give you a dime, me
Now get high, while you standing by me
My perfume is my cologne and I'm doing my thing
And I'm doing it alone
So the music just sings by itself
And this music is a dream
You are so beautiful to me
Who is this five, ooh I am so alive
S-O and I, and you know my name, so hi

[Hook]
Her booty off the chain and I'm getting brain
But I ain't making love to Nicki
Her booty off the chain and I'm getting brain
But I ain't making love to Nicki
Her booty off the chain and I'm getting brain
But I ain't making love to Nicki
