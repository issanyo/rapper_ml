[Verse 1]
Sometimes I wish I was common for a day but I'm modest anyway
The pain in my heart, yo, I gotta give away
Not to be a plague but we're dying for a change
Thought control has us all crying up the stream
From MySpace to Instagram coming together as in the plan
Gunnin' for forever but never giving chances
Progression is the lesson of mine
Depression weighs heavy on the mind, let me define
A physical weight is placed on your mental, disgracing haters
Is simple, take away all of your vanity and pimples
Family's an issue for the lost and rebellious
Girls stay alone, thugs talk to the fellas
The yuppies taste the paper, while the gangsters shank a hater
Independent artists want to make it to the majors
What we have in common, we can't wait to see the saviour
And none of us wanna hear later. Let's Go. Uh

[Hook]
Everyone, and I mean everyone
Take it back to the days
Where passion remains
We all gone be laughing away
I have to say to
Everyone, and I mean everyone
When God calls your name
And stops all the fame
So if you go hard go harder

[Verse 2]
Be clear on what your rights are, before you stand up
Think twice before you walk around like, "And what?"
Racism is fear, faces just appear
We stay live, and making decisions in tears
Take a sip, make a fist, break a break
Make a list of what you came to get, and make a break for it
Everything is black and white but no yin and yang
Which is why I don't spit with a different name
My shit is plain revolution, isn't a game
People crying out religiously, but when you complain
You get hit in the brain with a minister's cane
To be real don't enter the game
But at last, if your interest is fame
Then get your acclaim
Just don't nag, when you give up your name
Not trying to discourage, but I gotta just nourish
Develop yourself and then watch yourself flourish, come on

[Hook]
Everyone, and I mean everyone
Take it back to the days
Where passion remains
We all gone be laughing away
I have to say to
Everyone, and I mean everyone
When God calls your name
And stops all the fame
So if you go hard go harder

Everyone, and I mean everyone
Take it back to the days
Where passion remains
We all gone be laughing away
I have to say to
Everyone, and I mean everyone
When God calls your name
And stops all the fame
So if you go hard go harder
