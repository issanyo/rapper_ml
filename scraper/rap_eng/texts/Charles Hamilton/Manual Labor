At the back of the bus like Rosa. Don't wanna grow up, but I got a diploma. And I refuse to let the guy who drives this thing tell me that I can move. Or that I have to. That's my attitude. I black out on tracks, and history can view it. Nigga, we could be the movement. Just depends on if the beat with me is groovin'. Frequently, I move in the crib, letting niggas know who benefits from it. I feel so bad, because I'm feeling like a leech. Damn. Blame it on the beat. Can't really blame it on the speech, but you can blame it on the fact I'm a creep. And deep. Niggas can't hand me E. Because Ecstasy leads to famine for me

Does this shit sound familiar? For real, Bruh. It's real love. I feel up a chick, and will love the chick if she stays by my side to love the shit that I can provide. But that's probably not gonna happen, since I'm stuck with rappin'. And that (I imagine) is gonna be my bride. Word to the black eye I had gotten back in the day. Poppin' shit. Or maybe I did the opposite. See, I popped a kid in his lips, and then his cousin came through and straight rocked my shit. I learned then you should leave the youth alone. But, since then, I couldn't leave the booth alone. So what I do is zone. In my home. Doom's the zone, and I end the zone. God damn!

Either Flea or Brian Cockerham can make the jam rock even more with the bass. So I imagine both of them. Make the beat wanna *i* them. Then rappers wanna try again. Violent is the way I come with these words and make your bitch wanna jizz in my face. Pardon me for callin' you a bitch, but the heart of me is all up in your ditch, and you started with me. Life's a bitch. I'm pointing at the sunrise while I get lifted. My blinds is the shit! Kinda reminding me of my eyes, because I need a little lift to see the beginning of this shit. Creation, outside. May I doubt time? I may not. Therefore, I gotta grind. Always on it, till the day I calm it... down
