Faded off my ass, talking to the glass. Look at shorty walking pass with that ass. I just want to pay attention. Not even worry about passing my class. You see, life is a test and the club is high school. Just like the industry show me love because I do all the things that my enemies wish to see within them. I mind my business. But they'd like to be like me. Like I'm Spike Lee or they'd like to like me. I don't roll that way. What, are y'all gay? Please stay away while a nigga just play. You hear the sample? There is none in it! Just isn't this track. So sit back and relax with the fact that I'm jamming. Hamilton on his composition, stanza shit

I can see you waiting
Waiting 'til I'm zombie faded
You've got me faded, you've got me faded

I treat my wrist like it's the face of a hater. Spitting in the face of a hater. Face full of craters. That's why I stay away from the limelight even though I'm nice. I'm the gothic Drake. You gotta stay awake when listening to me. Especially when I'm spitting these frees. I'm the bee's knees, mind your business. When I'm spitting I'm the shiznit. Gotta love the rhythm, I'm such a composer. Love it until it's over. Such is when you're sober. Oh, what you said about me? Your head is crowded, B, with thoughts of another nigga. You gotta love the nigga, even though he's some sucker nigga. You paid for it - What is he, YG? Please stay behind me when I do my thing

I can see you waiting
Waiting 'til I'm zombie faded
You've got me faded, you've got me faded

I got Control like Kendrick with a sentence. My sidekick says I'm demented. My psychiatrist likes this shit. She likes to vibe with it, she's on my dick. Sorry miss, just give me my prescription. Or just listen when a nigga spitting. I'm out the psych ward, I'm in the mic booth. So I do my thing, word to my tooth being loose from the nastiness that I spit from behind this shit. My tongue is like minuses, a minus sign. Behind your mind when I rhyme like this. Think about it, if my tongue was tracks, what you want back? That old flavor! So I got no neighbors, I'm so hot. And I don't got no haters, so don't plot

I can see you waiting
Waiting 'til I'm zombie faded
You've got me faded, you've got me faded
