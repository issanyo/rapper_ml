[Verse 1]
On the way down the birth canal I met Satan
He was in my mother's cervix just waiting
Said, "Join me or your death will be blatant"
Sorry Matt Damon, that's a Bourne Ultimatum
My mother reached in and said "Sorry, God made him"
He ain't yours Satan, you must be mistaken
Satan told me what a mistake I was making
That's why when I'm gone, my mother feels vacant
Life is metaphorical, ain't it?
My mother's a soft cell, so my love is tainted
School me y'all ballers, call me Mr. Macon
I sat in his class everybody hated
SAT English, but I didn't hate it
I used it to make my vocabulary dangerous
So every 16 is a Van Gogh painting
And as I stand here at the pearly gates naked
I say....

[Hook]
Hey God
I know you brought me here for a reason
But everybody down here is still grieving
And even if you let me stay here for a season

(Maybe i’ll stay)
(There's a chance i'll stay)

So let me stay here for a little bit
I'll be back up there in a little bit
Now this could be just a huge mistake but..

(Maybe i’ll stay)
...

[Verse 2]
Take me back to Chuck E. Cheese in Ohio
Back to the basement in Cleveland watching Fivel
Back to when I walked through Harlem with my Bible
Sunday morning going to refuge for revival
Back to the day when I first met Howard
Back to my uncle's first day in Howard
Back when I thought only rappers ate carrots
Back then, V.A. before I knew her name was Jamarris
Nah, I'm ain't obsessed, not even embarrassed
Sorry for repeating your name, feel like a parrot
I ain't trying to smear your name, just venting
I got it all out, now I can go on living
But I can still see a lot of shit divot
So I can still see a lot of shit different
And with the extra time on Earth I was given
There's still a lot of things that's still missing, dig it?

[Hook]
Hey God
I know you brought me here for a reason
But everybody down here is still grieving
And even if you let me stay here for a season

(Maybe i’ll stay)
(There's a chance i'll stay)

So let me stay here for a little bit
I'll be back up there in a little bit
Now this could be just a huge mistake but..

(Maybe i’ll stay)
...

[Verse 3]
If I could find a way to fly
Then I will meet you in the sky, meet me on Cloud 9
My destination is unknown
But there is nowhere else to go, meet me on the outside
But then I could find a consequence
Or it might be a lack of common sense
But when I meet those pearly gates
Will I tell the lord to wait?

[Hook]
Hey God
I know you brought me here for a reason
But everybody down here is still grieving
And even if you let me stay here for a season

(Maybe i’ll stay)
(There's a chance i'll stay)

So let me stay here for a little bit
I'll be back up there in a little bit
Now this could be just a huge mistake but..
