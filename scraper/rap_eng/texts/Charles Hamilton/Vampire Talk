Must be a vamp thing. Can't be a man thing. But I do the damn thing. Lyrically, I got to stretch out my hamstring before I tell you what Hamilton brings: Lots of knowledge and pollution, like college is the solution.  The problem is I don't really use it. I am  quite abusive with music. I've been trying to push niggas away because they've been loooking in my face and telling me lies. All for them dollar signs that I got to define and divide by. I'm not interested. I'm only interested to kill these niggas in a driveway with my nine. Don't acknowledge what the gat is. Just acknowledge the magic

More than enough

My critics picking up the fact I'm zipping up and busting tracks in half. Only beacuse I'm zipping up and busting the cat in half. The difference was I give it love. But a nigga dug in the crates to look in the face of a nigga's drum. A big God, a big problem to niggas who just nod. It's just just snot, not just spit. I got a lot of shit that I got to get legit off my chest, like I'm benchpressing. I'm talking to the West and the East. And to the fact there's nobody better than me. All sides should agree. But until the day we can all rock with me

King of the Lo-Fi. People don't know I mix my shit in stereo but don't try to say that my shit is not dope. I pay a lot attention to my quotes. Why try to deny the fact that I am so dope when I rhyme. It's like hypnosis. My quotes is the dopest. So legit. So lifted the broken wind gets mended when my flow is delivered in a sentence or when you quiver. When you shake at the notion that this is greater than the ocean. You dive in it. Get baptized in it. I rap over guys, circles around niggas
