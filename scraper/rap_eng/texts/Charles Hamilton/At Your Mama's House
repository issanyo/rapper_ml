All I do is press C directly. Red Sea, intercept and part from me. The heart as you can see needs to beat. Staying away from the frequency, the deep and beneath. Running away, nobody to press C, but there’s a gun in my face. If I wonder then aye, I just want to run away. Keep my eyes closed, feeling the breeze. Some things I don’t know and it’s killing me.
