I already figured niggas won't get it.. i'm not slowing down(HOV!)

[Verse 1]
4 of us, niggas want more of us, such a shame , ain't no award for us
Pip board with us.. specially since we set the board for y'all
Playing chest getting bored with y'all
Move your pawn
Move your piece over there... ain't no peace over here, you'd be dead in a square
Pick the Glock, i dont wanna have to  grip the Glock, Hip hop just get shot
No need for the lip lock or lip toss, or lip gloss
Get Charles if you wanna get bars
Get Hov if you wanna get dough
Get J.D if you felling spacey, grab a hammer get low..cause
