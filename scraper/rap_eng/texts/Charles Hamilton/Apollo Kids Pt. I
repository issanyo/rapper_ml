Reach for it! Higher than THEE Georges. Gorges (gorgeous), breaking the bourgeois. Breaking the backboard, just hoppin’ over it. “Look at the floor!” It’s… my kicks. I blame it on them. They made me the guy who stay flamin’ these MCs. They mad at me. Dangerously against me, as if love was the OPPOSITE of gettin’ me. They get down, I get. Down. Like, “I’m the guy rhyming right now.” I don’t mind if you vomit. My style. Andrew WK. Fuck is you sayin’, mu’fuckas? I’m not stuck in my ways, but I can hand you a grenade and say “Up, up and away!”. Defending for the future. There is no ending in the future

Yeah

You blow my mind
You blow my mind
Got me in overdrive in overtime
Got me in overtime in overdrive

You blow my mind
You blow my mind
Got me in overdrive in overtime
Got me in overtime in overdrive
