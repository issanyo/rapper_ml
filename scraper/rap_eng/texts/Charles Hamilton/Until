Hmm, would y'all understand what that metaphor meant? If not, metaphor heaven, yeah, it's sent. E-mail to the darkest bitch in the biz, and for somehow Charles is the bitch in the biz. Y'all should just listen to this. If I say "bitch" that's the darkest shit you could get. Niggas will never understand my parking shit, or my metaphor for parking, until they're all in the whip getting high, sparking a spliff and they realize the park is the darkest place you could ever drift in.
