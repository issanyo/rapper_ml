This is not Degeneration X. It will not break down even if you penetrate it. Yes, with rape. And I expect you to date another guy because he expects his fate to be a mudslide. Or a landslide, like Oasis. But damn I can't be so damn fly. Because you can't fly when you're laying in a puddle and Dilla I'ma leave this beat laying in some rubble, like Barney. Let's go shopping! Let's see if we can pick up some rocks and get it popping. Throw it at a window, no window shopping. But the kid is gothic, and your bimbo's watching. And you probably wanting to being watching him with doing someone else underneath so he can end up another option from someone else to hop in. I'm not a whip but I get it popping like you threw a rock at this shit

I simply need enough money to get high and ask my memories if they remember me. Which could mean having enough chips to get Hennessy, fish and chips, and these chicks who wish to be with me. Oh! Only one of them. So it's no hope, honey, because I was never under them or over them. Never getting over what's over my head, I'm the over head of what's over my head, so I know you're thinking you're dead. How though? Because only in Mortal Kombat would you get knocked out cold and then sing the song 'Gauchos.' Or a voice even deeper, and that would be the feature. People mad at me because I asked Ms. Diva if she could follow me with her ass beneath it ("it" being my penis). Therefore when I beat it, you already know what she be screaming

Imagine the Sun being Satan. All of y'all would be bacon. And the one being who's baking y'all would straight up be safe from y'all. Making up his own game like Basic-ball, Baseketball. It's basic y'all. You hate on Charles and then there is no bacon involved. Meaning no pig, no hedgehogs, they all get lost or end up bacon with y'all. Fried bacon, y'all are violating. Hi Satan, if I ain't Satan then I'm Satan. But I'm saying, I'm Saiyan, like Goku. Like no booth, like no Pro Tools. Like "Yo, dude, don't even try. Don't even reply. I'm as high as the holes in the sky." You can call them stars or when the Sun decides to smile. Say hi to the sundial, I'll be here for a while
