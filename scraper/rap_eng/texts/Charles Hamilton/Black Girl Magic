I fell in love with a Black chick. Fell in love with a jugular, cutting Black chick. That's it. What in the fuck is that shit? Touching her magic spot with my cock and I love to just grab it. But this is magic. Could be fucked up if she finds out some faggot has been blacking with chicks. So I diss them. Forget dicks. Might as well have a V-A like Trick. But I'm G-A. Like way on S-E play. Kinda fucked it up. But yesterday them niggas left me, so I deserted them. So word to them. I'm perfect. Then again, when they come around I fuck up. Ain't a black girl flusters. What's up?

Why is my girl now rocking them diamonds and pearls? You are my girl. And all I can do is offer you my love

I fell in love with a Black chick. I mean a black chick, as black as the magic, that's it. "There's more!" Like Simpty, or the guy in Scary Movie. But simply I'm trying to hear the chick make her hear and hair with this uzi. Make every chick twerk to this and make twerk have a different definition. That ass she bounced to the gravity. Ounces I have to be passing to mountains. Make 'em all want to clash with me like sound boy. Even though I get down, chick. Mind this, round bitch. Cause I get down when I spit my rounds and shit. Had to make it simplistic. The rap Limp Bizkit

I fell in love with a Black chick with strap-on. Put the pass on, now I black on that cat till the cat's gone. But the cat's strong enough to deal with the bong I clutch when I want to get high. Thinking about them niggas while they listen by. At the same time, I am the reason... Oh man, hold up, holdup. I wrote this in my head. At the same time, you are the reason that I am victim. Therefore, I die when they listen. So if they listen and vibe to the guy who was dissing them, may they be blessed. No stress. Shit. Now a nigga sounding like Jeff. Which means I'm sounding like my death. I expect it. No Triaminic. I'm just dying a minute while I respect shit
