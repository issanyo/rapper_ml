Bitch I love this beat

Hear me out
I'm so down, that if you press A, I'ma knock a nigga straight into yesterday
Liu Kang. I do my thang. The music thang. You knew my name Now it's time to know
Like it's time to snow. NYC
January. February
Necessary to be the man who's scary
But don't make me take it to December
A month before these niggas might remember what a ten is with my sentences
See, I'm abusing time. Not to say that I don't love it, but fuck it
The way I moonwalk through time has niggas saying you often out your mind
But I'm way too cool for the shit that I spit
This ain't preschool dude. Just listen to this!

Oh, come on and check it out
I'm holdin' it down in my house
Oh, check it
Oh, check it
Oh, check it
OUT!
I'm holding it down, and it's still my house

Y'all can call me Charles McCartney
The way I talk to beats it's all exhausting for other MCs who can't talk what I bring
Because I bring the night sky and light beams
Mad prisoners to my prisms. Listen for a minute
See, I like to light light on fire
The kinda bright type
I'm only calling myself a little bit of a genius, because I have a little bit of a zenith. And I reached it
Now I'm beyond it. Just to be honest
Every time I vomit, niggas like to bottle it and sip it. Fine then
Follow me a minute. I'm a model with these bitches
And they love to sit next to me, while poppin' ecstasy
O, blessed be

Oh, come on and check it out
I'm holdin' it down in my house
Oh, check it
Oh, check it
Oh, check it out
I'm holding it down, and it's still my house

These conversations are meant for your contemplation
But, honestly, I'm just making shit for niggas to say andale to that fake shit
The greatest I am, and will remain. Damn
A nigga's name is getting stretched out
'Cause these niggas put an X to my clout
I came through with excellent doubt
Put the world on. Now the world gone
Dog gone, world
Why you had to be a dog? Life's a bitch. I don't like this shit
But I'm into beastiality
Hit it from the back, till indeed she laughs at me
That bitch wanna get walked
While I'm walking hip-hop with my slick talk
Get off is what I do all the time
So, call it a rhyme. I call it a lifespan of mine

Oh, come on and check it out
I'm holdin' it down in my house
Oh, check it
Oh, check it
Oh, check it out
I'm holding it down, and it's still my house
