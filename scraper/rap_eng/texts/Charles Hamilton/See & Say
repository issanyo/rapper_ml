[Verse 1]
Uh...
Thinking 'bout the future tryna stay in my right mind
Thinking I'm the future I don't play when I write rhymes
Pink is not a gimmick I done mean it when it's on
Reason I don't give it up it seams 'cause I sit strong
Sittin' on the block with the bottle of red dog
Listening to sounds I'm Sonic the Hedgehog
Niggas wanna knock it so I'm knocking they heads off
Little nigga watch it I'm watching so tread soft
Got a lot of killers as some people that I know
Roll up the weed but they holding me to the bible
Why? it takes a man to listen to his word
But that's kinda homo so I flip em a big bird
Charles knows a lot snuffalufugus
My whole crew ruff it's tuff to fuck with us
Your girl is my slave just another touch
I can speak for days now listen to the see and say

[Hook]
Fuck outta here
Lemme go over this shit
Did y'all niggas catch what I said?
Lemme lemme just show y'all niggas
'Cause ain't nobody out there fucking with him
'Cause Ain't 'cause ain't nobody out there fucking with him
Pull up and let it rip
Pull up and let it rip
Pull up and let it rip
Pull up and let it rip

[Verse 2]
I have sex on the ground so shut the fuck up
Love in the middle such is fucked up
My niggas holed me down like a gravity force field
It sounds like it's up to me actually more real
Which is actually more real
Than I ever gotten there has to be more still
Which explains why I don't have any awards
Wait, why don't I have any awards?
I go hard like a cavity more fill
Even the word "nice" is mad at me: "You're ill"
Larry David meets Cassidy Orville
Gladly eat a break call me Corvill
Or Carvall my bars are that cold
A tough one to swallow like hard tobacco
Sick with a Loop Charles Fiasco
My balls even call me an asshole
No homo

[Hook]
Fuck outta here
Lemme go over this shit
Did y'all niggas catch what I said?
Lemme lemme just show y'all niggas
'Cause ain't nobody out there fucking with him
'Cause Ain't 'cause ain't nobody out there fucking with him
Pull up and let it rip
Pull up and let it rip
Pull up and let it rip
Pull up and let it rip

[Bridge]
If I said I ain't the hottest then I'm lying my ass off
Being modest but I'm lying my ass off
Lying my ass off
Lying my ass off
Being modest but I'm lying my ass off
Lying My ass off
Lying my ass off
If I said I ain't the hottest then I'm lying my ass off
Being modest but I'm lying my ass off
Lying my ass off
Lying my ass off
Being modest but I'm lying my ass off
Lying my ass off

See and Say

Pull up and let it rip
Pull up and let it rip
Pull up and let it rip
Pull up and let it rip

Let's go!
