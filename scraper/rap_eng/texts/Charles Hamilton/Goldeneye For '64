I am the man with the golden gun life for me wasn't a hole in one .So roll with me while I load the gun. Roll up something to explode my lungs. I got a little story to tell my name is Joe my friend Jimmy said away he had to go because with me was a semi I blasted away my ho and a whole town of people who considered me a foe. And now I considered Jimmy (?) low so I hopped off the Hendrix and hopped out the sentence of my best friend is. Shit, how could you lose my friendship? I'm fucking sick of this shit. Losing friends because of me moving in a higher context of being a killer. But believe me my nigga I'm too serious for this shit

Hi! And you'll never see me again
Just gold and dust. I say...
Hi! And you'll never see me again
Golden gun. Golden, golden, golden G-U-N, golden G-U-N
Right here waiting for you!

I am the man with the golden gun explode for some but unload on the boldest foes and yo these niggas wanna roll with huns, mad bitches. While I roll with niggas with mad ones and at the same time mad guns, meaning mad stitches. And no witnesses or at least a mad witness. You want to see there's something of your to go to. That's how I roll with the goal when I roll through. Stroll through see who getting dough to extort them and who I'm going to give the go to, I mean give the dough to. But give the go to niggas with the dough cause they get the dough from you-know-who. Now you can choose while I'm holding this pistol
Golden is the pistol the golden-est issue. Kill you and have blood on my gun and be the love motherfucker #1

I am the man with the golden gun and I refuse to believe I had to grow up dumb. I'm too smart to be a teacher and too stupid to be in jail, so I'm a creature. Catch me while I beat your entire thesis of me needing a feature. No one can come on a track and describe me like me, so therefore I consider business grimy. They're not buying me but they follow my rules. Like get down, lay down and swallow some tools. And I don't mean penises you urban niggas. I mean, some straight up screw-driving swerving niggas. And you already know whenever Hamilton's taunting that means Hamilton's haunting and It's Hamilton you're wanting. If I do voodoo it's Hamilton stalking
