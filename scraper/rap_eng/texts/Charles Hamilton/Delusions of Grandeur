There we go

Riding in a whip no tints, hand out the window, bimbo shit. My M.O. is giving out a demo to niggas. Hoping that it figures that a memo is a demo. Niggas didn't know that I been dope. John Nintendo staying focused but a limo rolls up with the with the grim reaper in the back of it, laughing and shit. Having his wit and his thick chick rapping along, rapping a song. You want to hear the lyrics don't you? You're not focused, I hope you don't end up dying in the process, trying to get knowledge

I open my eyes and I see your face
Delusions of grandeur
Because you look like the sun
And you feel like the rain

Putting my Weezer in my hash pipe, That's right, getting mad high. Last night was such a blur, fucked up, and it occurred to me that I need surgery to remove the lust that I murdered in the heat of the moment. She was golden, she already knows it she wants to get low with me. she on the dance floor and her body movement is poetry. So is the flow I speak. Hopefully you notice me in a lineup when the cops try to size up. I am that guy grabbing on my nuts. That fly having a fly touch. But flight is only a touch to my dust who can freeze you as soon as he needs you

I open my eyes and I see your face
Delusions of grandeur
Because you look like the sun
And you feel like the rain

With every pull of the J, I look it away. In a Brooklyn day, which is nighttime. I may have to look away at a life of crime to stay alive for my bride who resides in the same place I would hide in, hidden. Beside the very fact that this is a grand rhythm. Brand new, it can't stand you too. Unless you nodding, an extra problem. Got a blessed person nodding

I open my eyes and I see your face
Delusions of grandeur
Because you look like the sun
And you feel like the rain

The name of this project is Fear The Reaper
I want you to fear what you can kill
I want you to fear what is real
And I want you to feel what you can feel
With that said, feel me on this
