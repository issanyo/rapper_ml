[Verse 1]
Who would've knew the shit talker was a moshpitter?
That's how i know my anger is realer than y'all niggas
I try all liquors, got high with all swishers
Seen a wall full of crawling pictures, falling scriptures
And they all had my name on it
I'm an emotional whore. give it to people if they want it
What is it? pure emotions when they don't deserve it
So i hope that when i focus ill be close to perfect
Until then let my ADD..
Make me make believe that everythings ok with me
Out the hood physically, in the slums mentally
Either location.. no one will visit me
Lady luck is so sweet she made me jizz my jeans…
With the lenience how my vision be when i dream
If you receive a minute free from your busy day…
Listen. cuz i know you wouldn't anyway

[Hook]
Im out of control
But at least I know it
Its coming out of my soul..
Not afraid to show it
…its as real as i can make it
Its as real as i can make it soo…
Leave me here in my…
Stark raving sick sad little world

[Verse 2]
I fall in love with every woman..
At a drop of a hat
Get the top, get some cat
Then we stop with the crap
Still wanna chat with the top cats..
And ask how they manage to stand with the top hat
And watch cats hate.. i digress
My laundry is my drama pollen
So i clean house while bumping rhianna's album
My niggas think im strange..
My obsession with the game maintains
I just hope she could remember my name
How sad is it for me to have some shit..
That i must imagine it
If i said i was happy.. then id be gassing it
My attitude got me smoking cigarettes and mad additives
A pack of the baddest tobacco blasted with a bag of piff
Sounds kinda lame…
But sounds kinda fly.. guess it sounds kinda.. plane (plain)

[Hook]
Im out of control
But at least I know it
Its coming out of my soul..
Not afraid to show it
…its as real as i can make it
Its as real as i can make it soo…
Leave me here in my…
Stark raving sick sad little world
