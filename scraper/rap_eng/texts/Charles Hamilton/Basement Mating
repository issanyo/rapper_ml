I made an honest mess. I said "pontifex". And now, I gotta be Kanye West meets Cornell West meets all the best meets all the people who can argue and start the vest(s) with its bickering with my chest. Y'all are listening to my best. No argument when I spit from the flesh. I mean the tongue. I mean the lungs. I mean, somewhere niggas will never understand until they get clever and try to see The Sun of Man. And I don't mean to be sonnin' Man, but I wanna run again. I wish I was Sonic, but this is just honesty coming out of my lungs. Because I'm in the zone. Nigga, NO! DON'T YOU EVER STOP, BECAUSE THE FLOW IS SO DIGITAL! AND IT'S SO PHYSICAL, TOO (when it holds you)! So you know it's OD! Time to get some Nobu!

See, I moved in a village. I was doing my business. And these people wanna move with attitudes. And I get it. Because I represented Sonic in the most honest way. But now I represent Charles Hamilton in the most GOTHIC way. And all they say is... what I gotta say, when I have an argument and I tell a nigga Agape won't stop they movement(s) when I am in control of it. So, I'm like the soul of it. Ain't nobody holdin' it. Hold it just a bit, because I gotta slow it down. These niggas is so impressed, and I know I mow 'em down with the flow. It's so profound... and the words I choose... "It's so perfect, dude! It's like the perfect shoes!" Barefooted in the booth, while I'm holdin' a loosie. And I ain't even holdin' no looseleaf... I'm just controlling your moves. "He is so in contuned with himself. In conjunction..." nigga, get to jumpin'!

Sex is a handshake. Some people can take what it may do. A man can break. Like your man Drake. Not saying he's soft now, but I'm the one he gotta talk down to. And he kinda has been, but I'm not a Has Been. So nigga, this round 2. Look at who found YOU. And now, it's time to get to moving to the rhythm, because I'm just you was already grooving to the rhythm. Or, maybe I overheard it. Or maybe (God dammit), I'm nervous and it's over. But I done heard it and I'm sober. So, I'ma keep on zoning with zone that I been permitting niggas to "get in and listen to my shit" when whispering. But this is cool, now. Because I grew down. At the same time, I got a new style. I got a boo now. And she too down. And she lovin' this rhythm. Now get my shoes, now...
