(Verse 1)
Best position, but stressed in trippin'
Blessed with living, but depressed when questionin' it
Wake up in my bed alone
I never know if I snore or move my head is cold
Frozen dreams, stuck on thinking bout you holding me
Slowly we, rose the heat
I stop thinking
It’s cold again, I supposed that when, I go in
It’s the coldest wind
If love is a game
Am I supposed to win?
Or supposed to be the best?
Or supposed to be a ref?
Please suggest, and let me know
Recognize me fast, and accept me slow
Because, when two finally meet
They silently speak
Eyes are mystique
Silence critiqued
Should we really stick around here?
Look at what I found down here
Take a listen to me

(Chorus)
We can see the stars at point blank range
But from the ground is the view the same
...Or does that seem strange?

(Verse 2)
Press the elevator button down
Take a good look at what’s around
You love it now
It’s not that how, nothing could be found
On the ground
When you fuck around and go another round
With the sluts you found, down here
Looking at the ground with a frown
Cause romantic situations got you looking like a clown
But now you want to settle down, on level ground
With the princess, you know doesn't eff around
Doesn't talk, just walk
So about it
So there's gotta be a way for me to go about it
No, I doubt it
Song it must be
But I've been away for too long
I'm rusty
So strong, I must be, the wiser the better
We vibing together
Her eyes are together
Blinded by minds, in silence
Tryna, better themselves
I made them close their eyelids
And get 'em silent
To vision, where I envision that you and I live

(Chorus)

(Verse 3)
The elevator finally arrived
My eyes leave your thighs
You guide me inside
Well I followed your walk
Acknowledged your thoughts
Stopped at your door
Not anymore
"You're not just gonna walk away from me," I said
Please stand with me
Don't tell me that this is just a cheap fantasy
You give a sweet glance to me
Said, "Not now"
Can't stop, now
Straight to the top, now
I pressed the wrong button
It was not down
I'm above you, but I love you a lot now
Because, I see what you go through
You need me to hold you
Believe me, I'm so used to needing a coastal evening
But no use fiending
I'm local, see
When I hope you receive me
I know you receive me
And no boo, I don't assume it's easy
When you get down from the penthouse

(Chorus)

(Talking)
Heh
Dead ass
I guess it's natural to feel like you're flying, you know?
I guess that's cool, then
Heh heh heh
You know...
