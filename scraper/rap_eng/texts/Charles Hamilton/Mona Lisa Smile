I was pissed at the game she was switching her frame, wishing to get my way. Or was it a part of her job description on a Friday: Put make-up on my face. Met her at that video, [ ] she's a silly [ ]. Pardon me, though. Didn't meant to call you a ho because I saw you from a UFO. But that don't mean you were the one. I've seen so many under the sun and so many belong to him
And I don't really want an argument but you were so strong to him, so tall again and again I saw you win when you bent over I was sober. You and I wanted to get closer but, oh!

First she says I'm magic, then she says I'm just a guy
First night girl I had it, just the look in your eyes
You are not the one but I guess it was fun
You are not the one but I guess it was fun

You've won every argument so far, but I know I don't have to go far. Sometimes I feel like I am your broad because I don't want to talk no more. So awesome, I thought, that's what you think and have you been drinking? I am a magician. Not one of those faggot hims. I get it in when I'm blacking from the back and you have to grin because you know that ain't an accident. That's all I did. Hit it from the back you see how tall you is? I had to hop on a ladder for the pussy, that's why I got madder at the pussy. Hit it so hard made it splatter and gushy. Are you mad at the rookie?

I don't want to say that you were a groupie. But you moving to me. Cluelessly you be doing the you thing I see when
You see when you look at me. Which is a guy who nicely needs to get icey to see what you could bring [coughing]. You're too beautiful to me. Man fuck it, keep the coughing. You don't get to hear me speak so often on a beat that I go off on. And it's for a girl that went off when she was in her thong. Bent over, everything was wrong. But everything was right on a single man's night. Come on!
