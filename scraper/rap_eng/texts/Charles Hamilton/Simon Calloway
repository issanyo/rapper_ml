Moved to NY at age 5, before A.I. took over being a virgin by playing in the city you could Phil him in. Our sentences  structuring, not giving a fuck when and if someone else was benefitting the rise. Nigga, I was 5! Wishing I was not alive. Crime around me. The main crime is the sound, nigga's saying I ain't getting down. My Black family trying to clown me! Now look at where they found me. Started from the bottom and I'm robbing a 6. Often I'm a problem and I'm watching a bitch. Sorry, I got it and I'm gothic with this

Like Carmelo in La La Land with a broad that's yellow and high, high yellow. Yellow in my eyes, yellow in my veins, yellow in the weed, yellow in the strain, yellow in the pain. Yellow when I'm mellow when I'm yelling at the pain. Fellows want to bellow when I tell over a brain. Never will I Dilla, though. Pause. See the dildo? Niggas getting fucked. Get killed, for what? All this power around me. All this sour around me. Yo, they clown me
