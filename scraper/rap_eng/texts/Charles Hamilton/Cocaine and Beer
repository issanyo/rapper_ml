Back from having an accent and splashing in a chick as an accident. It's Captain Save-a-Hoe, Captain Only-One-Track-Got- on-the-Radio. Payola and Crayola is the reason why that other track hit the surface. But now I'm back, picture perfect, rapping. Curtain for all the cat's rapping, I'm perfect. And that was berzerk, I guess. I'm giving myself props because I worth the best. The perfect ones with flow know they're near the guns and strokes. But hoes ain't going nowhere no MO-R-E, retardedly. Don't talk to me while I'm going off on a beat. Why? I just might swing. And you replaying just might be the thing

I see you looking at the broken nail, baby girl
I see you lurking. It's perfect now, baby girl
I see you love the way you work it out, baby girl
It's your world, baby
It's your world, baby
It's your world, baby

I got God pregnant and used Satan's pitchfork to give the abortion of life. Therefore, the next time you see a little kid by my side and she's not Willow Smith, that means she's down for homicide. Niggas in the group trying to tell me that my shit within the groove is not healthy. You can suck my dick because you ain't buying a thing. And I'm riding with people who be liking my things. They like when I sing. The hip-hop shit that I be on is the honest prophecy. That's an oblong box for thee. You might die inside of it or end up on TV, wondering how I make it look easy. Saved it forever, maybe it's pleasure. And even if it is, I say it's forever. And who am I? The girls, dem sugar. A love with I, the girls should 'fess up

I see you looking at the broken nail, baby girl
I see you lurking. It's perfect now, baby girl
I see you love the way you work it out, baby girl
It's your world, baby
It's your world, baby

The pink bastard thinks faster than the Pink Panther needing cancer to get richer. Sick of these bitch niggas trying to get in the big picture. How about I abort myself with the pitchfork that God used to get rid of that awful, noggin-using daughter of mine? Oh wait, she's alive. I say she's alive. It's crazy but, baby, we live! I crack myself up like you know who. Now, who uses voodoo like judo?  Who's so official with stripes that come out of the mouth are the whistling type? You know, bars. You know I go hard. I go hard for no reason... Where's the blowjob? Hi, Monica. I'm all through the monitors. The gothic Bill, and I'm rocking still
