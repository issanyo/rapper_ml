[Intro]
Tell me why they listen to the sickest dude rapping?
(Ahh, ahh, ahh, it's a breath of fresh air)
Make 'em wait...
The wait is over

[Verse 1]
Sometimes I think I'm moving too fast
Cause if I crash while I'm moving you laugh
Who's mad? Who's glad?
Who's sad that they can't do that?
Just finished rolling up two bags
Of bluegrass, the new hash
I'm in heaven I don't wanna move back
My life was a lie, now I'm living true facts
My situation good and my bitch is too bad
And I get her wetter than a swimming pool (Splash)
Flipping new tracks, hitting two bad
Bitches who have picture cool pass
If I kiss them while they listen to the sickest dude rapping
Ripping instrumentals, intuition do matter
Does matter, this the new tactic
Get the clue bastard, this the new pattern

[Hook]
Just jump til you get to cloud nine
Just jump til you get to cloud nine
Just jump til you get to cloud nine
Just jump til you get to cloud nine (Press C)
Just jump til you get to cloud nine (Press C)
Just jump til you get to cloud nine (Press C)
Just jump til you get to cloud nine (Press C)
Just jump til you get to cloud nine

I know what you wanna do
I know everything you're trying to be
I know what you think is true
And I know just what you're trying to see

[Verse 2]
Can't believe it man, I made it this far
Life is harder than a Jadakiss bar
But I gotta live a life of justice
Life is a beat and I gotta do it Justice
Trust it, that's how I know I got substance
So you can't blame it on substance
Played my music for the devil and he loved it
Called God and said I've had enough
It's time to give it up, let the little nigga have it
The little nigga's a savage with a real nigga balance
Being real ain't a real nigga talent
Being a real nigga is a real nigga talent
Seven and seven is fourteen
The letter N, nigga support me
And you my nigga if you feeling the vibe
Just keep it real and don't consider your eyes
I ain't even worried 'bout clouds on my path
Cause I done rained on clouds from the past
So when they wanna get down I just laugh
You can kiss the True Religion crown on my ass
That's how I get down with my bad, self
I'm James Brown when I black
I feel good, no pity party
I'm in everybody nose like N.E.R.D

[Hook]
