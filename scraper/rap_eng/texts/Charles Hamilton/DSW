[Verse 1]
Meet me at Starbucks, 125th and Lenox
Can't wait to see you, I ain't seen you in a minute
You grab a Cappuccino, I grab a Latte
Ironic on this rather hot day
Your outfit give me thoughts that I'd rather not say
But ask and I'll say I feel like acting out today
I walk from Lenox to Morningside
Come with me, it's a park, I told you that I'm a boring guy
More than why I'm single right now
But as you could see that's right now
I don't want to let you into my zone, but I kind of have to
To make you understand why I'm not a bad dude
But in the eyes of others, I'm a whack dude
Could be mad true or they have a mad view
Walk with me to Morningside Ave to
Hear my future thoughts that's conceived in my past shoes

[Hook]
Put your walking shoes on and let's go...
Somewhere odd, somewhere special
Somewhere that it's easy to let go
You feel that, then it's me that you should let know

So let me know, pretty lady are you ready to go
What, you don't know?
I'm ready to go
So on your mark, get ready, let's go

Let me give you what I got
Let me give you what I got
Let me give you what I got
Let me ...whatever

[Verse 2]
Ok, maybe it's cause I have a penis
But it's hard for me not to glance at your cleavage
And maybe I'm more Quagmire than Cleveland
But I was born in Ohio, I'm used to soft speaking
Give me your hand, no it's not G
I'm not trying to make you hold my cock, please
Chill, your fingers are smaller than mine
Even if they are larger, it's all in your mind
You think your body's unshapely
Anyone feeling you is dumb crazy
But young lady, girl, woman
Categorize yourself
In a matter of time you're gonna have to decide for yourself
If you gonna live stuck in the mud
But the image is to stick in your head, fucking you up
Is it your past or women's intuition?
Maybe you will get it in a minute
Just listen

[Hook]
Put your walking shoes on and let's go...
Somewhere odd, somewhere special
Somewhere that it's easy to let go
You feel that, then it's me that you should let know

So let me know, pretty lady are you ready to go
What, you don't know?
I'm ready to go
So on your mark, get ready, let's go

Let me give you what I got
Let me give you what I got
Let me give you what I got
Let me ...whatever

[Verse 3]
I try to be where you never think a guy should be
Inside your secrets, why would you lie to me?
We can't kiss cause we're friends first
Aight, cool, but how can lips make a friendship disperse?
Question the humanity
It'd make sense when you step into my sanity
Meaning when I stop talking and let you respond
I feel special cause you letting me lecture you on and on
About what's wrong with letting it be
"It" being whatever we should be
So if ever we should creep, exploring
The pleasures in me reaching deep
You still know that you could speak to me, easily
Cause peace is sweet
We ain't gotta be loud about it
But you got a place in my heart, be proud about it
Got it?

[Hook]
Put your walking shoes on and let's go...
Somewhere odd, somewhere special
Somewhere that it's easy to let go
You feel that, then it's me that you should let know

So let me know, pretty lady are you ready to go
What, you don't know?
I'm ready to go
So on your mark, get ready, let's go

Let me give you what I got
Let me give you what I got
Let me give you what I got
Let me ...whatever
