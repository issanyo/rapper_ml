[Verse 1: Charles Hamilton]

Cats have nine lives; life's a bitch
Put two and two together
This cat is Hugh Hefner
Never in your life have seen a dude fresher
Walk without a care but undergoing huge pressure
God signed my reality check; Who better?
So it's not deceit when I ask you who's better
This ain't a soap opera
So if you only have one life to live you lesser
Remember, I'm Hugh Hefner
See I don't play boy; pay to watch me
These young boys come of age to watch me
They don't pay attention so they cannot see
Niggas freeze when they gotta display they I.D
I'm sick; cancer in play in my beats
HIV and AIDS when I speak
Don't disrespect it; get infected
Downright superb lyrics nigga get connected
DSL to your Firefox I spit fire hot
But I am not a fox; I'm a cat
Wait til the fire stops
I write a lot; never lived on writer's block
Wondering if I will stop?
I will not; I am hot
Trying to stop me is like giving yourself syphilis
Or better yet giving yourself stitches

[Hook]

In the dark
Oh, in the dark

[Verse 2: Charles Hamilton]

The pink side of the moon
Pink is the inside of the womb
I give life to you niggas
And what brings life brings death
It might bring rest since the night means rest
But I'm a narcoleptic and nocturnal
So therefore I hereby welcome you
To the pink side of the tomb
Think not that you're doomed
The last poet that heard me
Was the last poet that heard me
Think audio doom
This Pepto you can't drink out of a spoon
You need a bigger dose
Clear the sink out for the dude
I don't box with God
Cause he's not gonna lose
He's Mick; I'm Rocky
I beat down on these fools
Leap in the clouds to speak out; orgasms
Skeet down on your food
Feast now on my news
I'm sleep now see?
Got my feet out on the blues
The Isley Brothers made a deep couch with the groove
I live music, breathe music, eat music, sleep music
Speak music, bleed music, need music
I believe music, see music, pee music
If you wanna say he's music
Then by all means please do it
If there was no studio
I'd do it in the park
And if the sun refused to shine
I'd do it in

[Hook]

[Bridge x2]

I'm lurking in the dark
Can you see me?
In the dark
Can you see me?

I'm lurking in the dark
I've been crawling in the dark
Looking for the answers
