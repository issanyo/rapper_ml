[Intro]
Uhh...
Yeah, you just gotta bend your knees on beat, you know

[Verse 1]
Miles from home, my style has grown
Sick of getting played like a xylophone
My instrument is me with thousands of bones
Wildin', I just wanna zone
My mama knows I need a chick to be kinda dope
Smile a lot, give a lot of dome
Only to me, spoil me with your badass
You are like royalty, Baby catch that
See the rain is making me feel painless
This relationship is so dangerous
If they find out what will they make of it?
So I savor every kiss like it's ancient
You ain't missing a thing with other niggas who sing
I need cash just to give you a ring
Love at first sight but it was blocked by pain
So for you I will exceed the top 5 in the game

[Hook: Rita Ora]
In the city lights
I swear I hear you call my name
There is nothing right
I am stuck here while you're miles away
In New York raining, In New York raining
Its too much my babe I need you
Its too much my babe I need you

[Verse 2]
Red wine and cheese before bed time
You and I fell in love is the headline
Instead of whining about what I been finding
I stay silent and let you chime in
You want me to talk? Fine then
Someone broke your heart? Let me find them
But I hate fights and now I got stage fright
Until I'm at your place at the late night
You made me smile, stop doing that
A lot is on my mind when I rap
In fact, You are a lot I guess I rap for you
Needless to say the sex is magical
After you, chivalry I have to do
I love it when you catch an attitude
I wanna tease you, just to laugh at you
So the make up sex can be a faster move

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
When the rain falls down
The pain is all out, My brain
You call out my name and that's fame
I'm looking great but I still feel shame
For real, it's the game I feel insane
But when I'm with you my feelings change
I love you, I really hope you feel the same
You know what I am, You're holding my hand
No one else can so I'm your man
Your palm reads bliss, What are we miss?
You are what I miss and we all need this
Love and affection is all we miss
From the world but with each other thats all we get
I wanna hear you out, talk to me miss
I hardly wanna slip the awesomest kiss
Call me whenever, call me forever
As long as I can call us together
I love you

[Hook]
