Twilight 3 type music, uh

[Verse 1]
I need a Raven Simone, it's like clockwork
Don't need to say it, it's known, I might stop her
Like, "Where you going with a smile getting lasers jealous?"
So bright, no heights, who needs a paper fetish?
Some people say "forget it," I say don't "let it, bed it"
Making a wager to lose the paper, mache the lettuce
Fade away and regret it
Come back to stay and kept it
Yayo motions stay emotions up in my face and wet it
My nostril dragon moving, my sponsors acting stupid
Got a track to lose it on... hop in the 'lac and move
Don't catch an attitude, I ain't done with blacking boo
I'm just saying, I just wanna have you too

[Hook]
Tell me what to do, I wanna know
What you going through, I wanna know
What am I to you
You're Phil, Drew, Oz, and Oprah

[Verse 2]
I need a Bonnie Hunt
Watch the mommies stunt
Opposite of what I want cause not so thick
But I don't want to get popped in the lip
Because my honey punches my throat
Rather sit with Honey Bunches of Oats
And rub my tummy with ropes
Wrapped in wire, Barbie stitches
Acting all retarded with it
Rap inspire all the sick and tragic thoughts inside my fitted
Magic fire dire, the sacrificial requirements
Happy and required to savage tracks
The instant I get them
Packed inside of a ladder hitting midgets back pocket
Ravage the choir women after I set fire to harmony
The hymnal placed in the arms of me. Horribly, horridly

[Hook]
Tell me what to do, I wanna know
What you going through, I wanna know
What am I to you
You're Phil, Drew, Oz, and Oprah

Tell me what to do, I wanna know
What you going through, I wanna know
What am I to you
You're Phil, Drew, Oz, and Oprah
