Its the faculty music (Bringin' '88 Back)
You know I had another dream
I had a dream not only was 9th Wonder J-Dilla
But that dream also told me it was Sha-Leik
Then I had another dream that said I was with Beyonce Knowles

[Hook]
I see you in the rain
Me and you in the rain
And what we do in the rain
Can end the rain
I'm trying to feel
Deny if its real

[Verse I]
Yeah right, You, I'm too high
My self-esteem only rises to your two thighs
And it just dies in your two eyes
A new now when a dude cries
You lied, it can't be my plan B
A height I can't reach, I have to make you not stand me
I won't shower, I'll so be a coward
I'll flow even louder, so you can leave me sour
If it doesn't work, Murphy's Law was vetoed
Hurting all egos, surfing off in a Beatle
Damn, I don't feel good, won't give up but I still should
Walk to the Dream Girls set, kill Jamie
Then go at it with you raw until you slay me
Tryn'a out do you all
This is all you
Our nudity cause a new fall

[Hook]

[Verse II]
A black leather dress, straps on your heels
My teeth on the back of your heels, for real
You giggle as you bite your bottom lip
My eyes are too serious to not be legit
I unfasten the straps on your heel with my teeth and taste buds
We need to make love
The first raindrop squeezes your makeup
Fast forward and stay in touch
I unzip your dress, the dark clouds confess
They want to bare witness to this mess
Your portrait is now a levy for this storm
Lightning plays as confetti in this porn
I pull it out, you whisper, "Yes Charles"
I suck on your neck until your breasts call
And I let it all go on your left wall
We lay naked on the wet car

[Hook]

I just don't get it, you love me
Girl I ain't nobody to love
But I need somebody to love me
Are you that somebody to love me?

I just don't get it, you love me
Girl I ain't nobody to love
But I need somebody to love me
Are you that somebody to love me?
