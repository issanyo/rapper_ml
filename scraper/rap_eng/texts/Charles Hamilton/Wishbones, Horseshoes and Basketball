[Intro]
Charles Hamilton!

[Verse 1]
Starting to give up my hope
My heart is out of shape
Can't get up this slope
This sucks, I know
Pick up the soap
Raped by the faith, so I live just to float
In that baptismal pool, it's just that dismal
But the fact is that no black pistol
Can take away the inner pain that my mind encounters
Addicted to you, you're behind the counter
And I'm who found her, cure the empty heart syndrome
But it's really hard with these pretty broads drifting
I've never seen you, forced to believe
Blessed enough, so what more to believe
New reason why I'm scorching this beat
So the whores and the cheese ain't important to me
A warm heart that was forced to be colder
The force on my shoulder is a 4 leaf clover

[Hook]
I did it before, I'm trying again
I'm dying to win, am I lucky enough?
Lady Luck, where you at?
Lady Luck, Lady Luck, Lady Luck
Where you at?

I did it before, I try it again
I'm dying to win, am I lucky enough?
Lady Luck, where you at?
Lady Luck, Lady Luck, Lady Luck
Where you at?

[Verse 2]
I sit alone trying to think what our next encounter will be like
I doubt it will be like a first time
Basketball court in my hood
You was looking good, tight green jeans
I had my Nike sneaks
You a hot fascist(?), smiling at me
I was wild happy
At the foul line trying to drop buckets
The look in your eyes made me stop fussing
But I couldn't pop nothing
Lady Luck was near but not with me
Maybe I lost or maybe I got busy
Either way, I knew she had to stop kidding
Every time she plays hard to get, she dropkicks me
I don't not wish we split to begin with
I need her in my life, the most blessed man on Earth
And the best kept secret as his wife, alright

[Hook]
I did it before, I'm trying again
I'm dying to win, am I lucky enough?
Lady Luck, where you at?
Lady Luck, Lady Luck, Lady Luck
Where you at?
I did it before, I try it again
I'm dying to win, am I lucky enough?
Lady Luck, where you at?
Lady Luck, Lady Luck, Lady Luck
Where you at?

[Verse 3]
Can I have faith in luck
Is this space enough, are we awake in lust
Sleep in love, half baked from dust
Luck you gotta tell me
Don't want to rely on the Bel vi, dear
Don't cry cause when your eyeliner smears
I unwind a beer in the lonely ass room
Forced to hear voices I don't like to hear
Tortured by the voices, dynamite through my ears
I'm a psycho, it's clear, but please don't put me down
Pick me up and look around
There's no one else around, just us two
Just our luck, Luck loves us two

[Hook]
I did it before, I'm trying again
I'm dying to win, am I lucky enough?
Lady Luck, where you at?
Lady Luck, Lady Luck, Lady Luck
Where you at?
I did it before, I try it again
I'm dying to win, am I lucky enough?
Lady Luck, where you at?
Lady Luck, Lady Luck, Lady Luck
Where you at?

[Outro]
(Lost In Space)

"Listen, Doc, I'm, uh, I'm thinking this is your basic kiss for luck occasion. Wouldn't you agree?
-Major Don West

"Thinking... That's not really your strong suit, is it?"

...
(Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind)
Patrick:I never really had much luck with the ladies
Maybe if you stop stealing their panties

...
(Back To The Future Part III)
Doc: Well, good luck for both of our sakes. See you in the future
Marty: You mean the past
Doc: Exactly!
