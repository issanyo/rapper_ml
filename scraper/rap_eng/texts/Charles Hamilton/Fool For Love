[Verse 1: B.o.B]
She callin me back to her mattress
Back was like backflips we practice gymnastics
We got attached to the fact we attracted
You know I'm an addict and
My soul is a magnet
So if you get close then you can't go backwards
I know I'm kinda like a black hole in a galaxy
You are trapped beneath my galactic habits
I couldn't even notice the patterns, damn

[Hook]
But I was just so blind
You had me caught up at the perfect time
But I couldn't see it
I said I couldn't see it
Eventually I had to wisen up and open up my eyes
But I couldn't believe it, the way you looked was so deceivin
Cause I was a fool for love
Who sadly fell in love
With a girl who couldn't love X2
And now I'm sad in love
Cause I'm not the only one
And I'm beatin myself for love
For the girl who couldn't love
Cause I was a fool for love
Yeah I was a fool for love X3
Cause I was a fool for love

[Verse 2: Charles Hamilton]
Check HA HA
Hola Bobby
Let me tell ya about my ex
But yet so fly mommy
I probably had the chance to exit stage left
With her sister but whenever she left I would miss her
Lady dropped me like a cut in a track
Cuddlin cats who love they cat
A puzzlin accent, was she from Scandinavia
Or Fantasia from Asia
Click the mouse
I took a second to figure it out
Digging her out, kissing, adrenaline in her mouth
Is it about you? Her? Or is it somethin super?
Silly me still in love with a cougar!

[Hook]
