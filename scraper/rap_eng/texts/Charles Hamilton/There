[Verse 1]
I stopped looking at a certain piece of glass
'Cause I'm sick of feeling like a piece of ass
To myself so I need to laugh when I look at a puddle and see myself
I'm sinking fast in a puddle 'cause I love how I look but subtle
Unfortunately my rebuttal is giving myself a hug, no one to cuddle
With this distance is the width of your hips in your jeans
But miss this ain't the shit i mean, sit and listen to me as I vent
Needin' a friend.. I know you want me to beat it again
I'm pretty good at eatin' it, and there you go seated with a grin
But please believe..

[Hook]
There when you need me
There when I need you
Right here when I need you
Right there if you need me
But I'm so far away
I'm so far away
I'm so far away
I'm so far away
When you need me

[Verse 2]
You heard the chop with the big ass space in it
Now I'm feeling like this has a wasted minute
Because.. I don't know how many seconds and minutes it took for me to make this
And no one was around to see it but yet everyone heard me believe it
Then everyone got all twisted and curvy when I quoted it and retweeted
Got choked up.. Gettin' sick of talking about tweetin'
'Cause I ain't been seein' no people for a meetin'
You know, A one on one greetin'
Except for one female
I'll mention her this evenin' but she got the same name of another chick I was beatin'
Ha.. Listen up to that freestyle where I talk about everything

[Hook]
There when you need me
There when I need you
Right here when I need you
Right there if you need me
But I'm so far away
I'm so far away
I'm so far away
I'm so far away
When you need me
