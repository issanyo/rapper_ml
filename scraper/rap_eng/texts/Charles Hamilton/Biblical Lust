God, have mercy on my soul. To be Steve Jobs is hurting the globe. It's hard to be me, hard to be Steve. Means it's hard to see. Hard to witness me believing, kicking names, kicking asses and receiving different blessings and curses. Different spells, different hearses to dive into. When I die it's too, too God. Too odd to be true. Who rocks? Who's hot in the booth? Now, who's got jewels that rock? Who copped the blue drop? Fuck Ma$e.  I don't want to be such a disgrace. God, carry me. Embarrass me with all my sins. I'll call you again

When I say a prayer
Nothing matters any more
Nothing matters any more
Nothing matters any more
I pray that you wouldn't mind being my whore

Sometimes I can't say the rhymes that are in my mind. I simply let my spirit intertwine with my tongue. Speaking, Acts 2 and 38. To rap is too cool, but wait. Dirtiness has MCs saying they are absurd when they spit. But truly it's the nerves that I give. They get the flow from me. I kiss their chick's ovaries. Why do I like to lick vagina? I'm the king, they should be getting behind me! As in, in the past. As in, I dug in their ass like Hacksaw. But that's all, folks! Like Pig. Like Porky. Like this. Like it's not enough to like this. You got to love it. You got to dig it/dug it. I don't write shit

Invaded by Rice Raiders at night. They can't wait until I write. But God, you understand my plight. God damn, you're a chick! I wish I could hold you. My hands are legit, I can hold myself. I hold control. So much control when I hold my soul. But I overdose  inside a Christian chick.. The difference is your Christianity to wishful families is what I do when I pray.  And you can move and spew in my face.  Spit when you get drunk. This is what happens when I spit when I get drunk. Nothing seems to matter anymore. It's just me and the matter I'm bored. The matter at hand is holding your hand and making love to you. So what, dance
