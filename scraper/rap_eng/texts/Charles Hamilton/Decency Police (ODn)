[Intro]
AYOOO…
THE TOP ONE

[Verse]
I’ll never die
Best eternal MC
I’m so depressed, I made Pepsi turn against me
This ugly duckly, is sexy, permanently
Let me murder this beat. Reject the attorney’s fee
Gettin’ neck from a burnin’ freak
Let my BLIS-TERS leak, when I LICK HER deep
Make the b*tch enslave me
KISS HER feet
Let her disrespect, ‘till the b*tch turns to sleep
Then I return to the streets
Quick burn of the green
Flip the “third” on each, to the curb full of police
Like... Word, pigs
Beef
‘Cause word on the streets?
Second grade? NYPD took turns in my sheets
The real Abner Louima
Be indecent
Muthafuck the 26th precinct
HARLEM
Act right, and we don’t need the cops
Call Ray Kelly “five”, ‘cause he needs to stop
STOP IT, FIVE
N1ggas want me NOT alive
Start beef with REAL thugs, hoping to NOT survive
Dropped from Interscope; I spiral when I dot my eyes
I’m Iovo, when I cross my t’s. Watch the drive
A 40-zip run
I’m such a prick, I’d lick Gayle’s ass, just to get her shorty’s income
Like, 2 mil, RIGHT NOW
THEN cum
Charles Gigolo
Lookin’ for a vic-tim
I admit to some. I’m a bit dumb;
Pull out a big g**, like, “Where you get them clips from?!”
I’m Charlie, give or take an angel or two
The most familiar stranger to a few
Put the game in a noose
SUCH a strange view
Sleepin’ in the wrong studio, can maim you
Came from L.A., lookin’ strange to you
Gang banged in the booth, by these… B-CRAZY fools…
Hey, look, I just came to say the truth
But can’t say if it’s true, without displayin' proof
WELL LOOK
I DON’T EVER PLAY WIT’ CHU
If I SAY it’s true? I hope and PRAY it’s true
If so? I’m killin’ people
NO GAS
Go to jail with glue and DUCT TAPE ON MY ASS
My cousin Scooter did it
My c*ck is bigger than his, and he’s TALLER
God got SUPER vision…
Unfortunately, I was under my own supervision
Eat a uterus to hatin’ ass stupid b*tches
Floss your balls with barbed wire, you sub-human n1ggas
Jimmy, I love you. Just not your roster
Minus a few? Fake rastas, and imposters
I couldn’t fit in, ‘cause I’m a f*ckin’ Goth
Word
Shoulda’ got my head checked by the “doctor”
Then Curtis bully woulda' thrown me in a locker
And Marshall will throw my face into pasta
I guess too much
Kendra and her knockers
I was harder than BEATINGS at every marketing meeting
Kept it professional. Always started with a greeting…
I coulda’ had her heart in an evening
EASY
But Al Goldstein, said not to be sleazy
Her lap was a wack MC, sayin’ “Eat me.”
And I’m shy, like, “Yo, throw on a beat, Free!”
No rapper with oratory skills, can beat me
To beat me, you cannot have teeth, cheeks, a tongue, or a voice box to speak to me from
I am the common cold, when I speak to these drums
Add some fever, some ether, some tweezers…
And I can make your skull a speaker
For SILENCE
Like you said my name is loud?
I correct you
IT’S QUIET
Now, QUIT CRYIN’
Butter knife your head off, like “Quit dyin‘!”
…
Then you die, and I get tight, like “Quit tryin‘!”
I’m ill, like Hill, on a trip to islands
‘Cause I actually know a kid named Zion
Oh, you know ‘em too? Quit lyin’
Ayo. Pick a Ryan to diss, and diss Ryan
I never double-cross
Only ten-timin’
Hamilton timin’
Meaning, you can handle it, IN TIME
Come find me
I remember Shakia Stewart wanted to sign me
Theo, the Hamilton lawyer, right behind me
Like, “He’s every artist EVER."
"TIMES THREE.”
I said “Times three-hundred.”, he said, “Don’t remind me.”
My catalogue, is why I don’t have to battle y’all
Your bitch is bad? I say she’s not bad AT ALL
Breath smell like pussy, and full-court basketball
I am the reasons why, like “after all”
I spit fire, like earth, wind, and
Haters wonder why I rap at all…
…
BITCH n1gga, shut the f*ck up, 'fore I snap back your bra
Nice with hands, but my BARS will crack your jaw
I smoke good
For a buzz? Half a jar
Certain n1ggas ain’t survive not even HALF a bar
Freshest cracker in the league
Packer Favre
CH is a CHeesehead
You will bleed from the head, if you read what I read
BIBLE
… Leave you a sea full of red
You’ll look like Jada Fire, all them “seeds” on your head
You “slutty ass, take it in your butt and laugh” BITCH NIGGA
You “ugly ass, muddy ass, swallow n*t for cash, get a cut of what is half, and find out it ain’t JACK” BITCH NIGGA
You “wifin’ up, f*ck buddy, ass don’t love me, slash, wanna love me for cash” BITCH NIGGA
Your life is surround by MAD DICK, NIGGA
Now keep lyin’ to the public, fake Magic NIGGA…
…
You put a band on her finger
I grab her ass quicker
Go through a dry spell, and f*ck the SH*T out a river!
Goin’ so hard, I can spit out a liver
My dick is big. I simply live out the picture
I’m harder than gettin’ raped by ALL of Harlem
In one night. Go to another town, to start a problem
Go to Cleveland. DECK LeBron
And with my extra arm? Choke the n1gga who sexed his mom
I am the Cleveland indian
And the cavalier
And sorry, Cam, I’m the most Harlem rapper here
WhereEVER
I’m gothic enough to wear leather, and so thugged out, my stare can TEAR leather
Shoved the hanger in my ass, I see the future;
In ‘09, I replayed the scene for computers
Two years before then, I wrote the song “Loser”
…
Consider me the pessimism tutor
“F“ the system
It failed me
… SUPER
Gucci can rap?
But, FUCK IT
I’m CUTER
Real men wear pink
Then I am GOD
My pink essence had bitches thinkin’ I am ODD
Now they all DYIN’ to ride my rod
Not now, bitch, I DON’T HAVE writer’s block
My dick is like an air conditioner inside your tw*t
But fall back for now, because it’s ho-… Ah
It’s kinda ho- YO, STOP TOUCHIN’ MY DICK, bitch, I’M TRYIN’ TO JOT!
To quote Bill Bellinger?
I’m tryin’ to watch
CH is key
My flow works engines
Put the BILL n1gga’s name in your search engine
…
Rich n1ggas is tight
Word
Snitchin’
I get dressed, and be the Bird and Pippen
No “bull”shit
I’m fly on the mic
Lisa Marie Presley
Ride ‘till I die
High as the sky, with that lie in my eyes
Don’t be lyin’ in my eyes, muhf*cka, no lies or surprise, when I ride up on a 9, and BUY
B-Y-E
Shots to your e-y-e
I’m 5’7”, and iller than B.I.G., n1gga!
Because I’m M-E-D…
… I-U-M
N1gga, why you spend;
All your time on these b*tches, all your money on your mind, and your mind’s on them b*tches, so that honey is a dime, and that dime, plus…
Another dime, plus…
A nickel? Is a call to a chick that’s way FINER
Muhf*cka, I don’t have to wear designer
I got khakis from Zara
I will find ya‘
Log into Facebook, and then remind ya‘, what happens when I get behind ya’
If you check out the “T“?
Literally, if you check out the “tee“?
"Yo! MTV Raps", with the checks, no sleeves
Matter fact, SHORT sleeves
A short temper
Niggas don’t REALLY wanna remember…
I could bring it back, like Selektah…
A big WRECKA', of everything, except a RECTUM
Unless it’s a white chick, and she deserves it;
Other than that, when it comes to anuses, I get nervous;
So fuck ALL you assholes!
N1gga, WIPE
I don’t even have to get a pen to write
The reason why?
I been rappin’, since the night;
Decided to call itself night
End of night
Now it’s daytime
Y’all niggas pretend to “like”
Muthafucka, I’m not the one you should pretend to like
Because at 10 to 5? That’s 450?
I could have everybody in YOUR city, come and rock with me
Like… This is YOUR pity
I feel bad for you
‘Cause your whore is pretty
And I snatched her from you
…
I guess I considered that whore… YOUR city
…
GOVERNOR HAMILTON!
… These n1ggas ain’t PLAYIN’ wit’ me…
