[Verse 1: Charles Hamilton]
The fact I can read is a fact you will need
As we go through the factory of broken dreams
So many people are deep within the seams
They don't even realize what they witnessing
Not a witness left, so a witness leaves
All the things you can see in a different season
So people with they C's in
No minor gain
If you wanna minor then you are into minor things
And all I do is listen in, that's my diamond ring
Chasing after, never chase a rapper backwards
Get chased by all rappers
They all wanna diss me, they get chased by nothing
I let em hate they ghost even if they hating on the spirit of mine
Because you can hear it when I rhyme
I'm just gonna apologize right now
While people lie down with they fake rhymes like
"How can I?"
I'm so damned, alchemy with mind
That you think I'm out my mind, but no
You wanna count a 9 within
Then I don't know man, never rhyme again
Cause I went so many different levels if you can find it, then then
The rules to your favor, later neighbor
So hard I make craters get craters
Holla at me A, let's go

[Hook: Am3n]
To my homie sleep
They lie and they cheat
But I still gotta play the game
Piff got a nigga head so gone
Even if they kill me, imma still live on

[Verse 2: Am3n]
Nobody wanna be a hasbeen
I find myself walking down the road that my dad went
Running to the music biz with a blindfold
Bitch you could dig, but I doubt it if you find gold
Animal on the records like rhino
Apollo 13 couldn't bring you where my mind go
Now all the women that was trying to find independence
Be coming at me like DM's and Twitter mentions
Wordsmith, I could teach you how to bend the sentence
And bitch stay home if you got your end of sentence
And they old you knew, y'all rappers are now my kids
I was just a nigga stepping in like an intervention
And shout out to my dog Quentin
He don't talk, he just smoke niggas like a pack of Winston's
I'm trying to let the world know my intentions
Insomniac inside my cell having premonitions
Amen

[Hook: Am3n]
To my homie sleep
They lie and they cheat
But I still gotta play the game
Piff got a nigga head so gone
Even if they kill me, imma still live on

To my homie sleep
They lie and they cheat
But I still gotta play the game
Piff got a nigga head so gone
Even if they kill me, imma still live on
