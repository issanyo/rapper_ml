[Verse 1]
Imagine if masturbation captured Satan in a passion contraption..
Couldn’t be a savage, all the snatch he be catching!
Wait a minute
Evil in reverse is what we do, and it hurts for me to be such a fucking flirt
So much of a jerk, I get a rush when I jerk..
Blush or smirk when I think of a skirt that I fucked, and jerk…..
Not to call ‘em skirts but for all it’s worth
They want my wallet
And made me feel like they softest purse
Just wanted to be closer than a man ever attempted
I am who I am, no man better attempt that:
Removing me!
My stupid ego’s so auto-zone that I thought a poem would’ve brought it home
But no!
Here I am, on the ledge again
Stressed but, then again when am I not [gonna] need sex again?
Or a Cocoa Butter/Lacey hand stretch again?
Eff it then!
They imaginary, let ‘em in

[Hook]
WHO’S GONNA BE
The thought that gets me off tonight?
Baby, come and get me off tonight
Close your eyes and lift me off tonight!
5-4-3-2 to the One!
I ain’t tryna stop until my eyes try to run!
From not blinking and tryna Ice-Grill the sun!
IT’S JUST ME AND MYSELF IN THIS BITCH!!
IT’S JUST ME AND MYSELF IN THIS BITCH!!!

[Verse 2]
The sight of B
Makes me
Kinda weak
Thighs are like a Titanic iceberg and she’s Southern-hood!
Swear I could fuck her good
But while I’m here and stuck with a wood
Dreaming about getting her neck up on it
I gotta chill and check up on it
What if a nigga jack-off thinking ‘bout my daughter?
I taught her not to go around the block more than once..
Hey
Her pops was a smut..
So I could give a fuck as long as niggas is not knocking her up
I’m decking a nigga!
Respecting her wishes
Checking the niggas for at least not protecting the digger…
Sexing my precious and making a baby stretch up her figure
Mess up her dreams, whatever nigga!
I’m a believer
And deeper meanings behind I’m a, I’m a, a Diva
Doesn’t ignore Vagina appetite
I’m a rapper, right?
My mind is sad but bright
Saturday night……

[Hook]
WHO’S GONNA BE
The thought that gets me off tonight?
Baby, come and get me off tonight
Close your eyes and lift me off tonight!
5-4-3-2 to the One!
I ain’t tryna stop until my eyes try to run!
From not blinking and tryna Ice-Grill the sun!
IT’S JUST ME AND MYSELF IN THIS BITCH!!
IT’S JUST ME AND MYSELF IN THIS BITCH!!!

[Verse 3]
The colder it feels, you know that it’s real
So while I’m holding my steel, my lotion feels frozen……
TMI! Say the people who just got it
Fuck the buck, I make the buck stop it…
Paid 5 bucks for this bootleg Booty Talk and it’s worth it
Do I really wanna hear a groupie squawk about how she sucked off Sisqo and Lord Tariq?
WHORE, PLEASE!
Your story bores me..
More whores on DVD
Specifically just 4, please?
4 scenes and I’m forcing
ALL YOU NIGGAS OUTTA MY SPACE!
Got some self-love making to make
Niggas hate my music, right?
So I felt love making was great
I feel like Michael Phelps, just wasting away
‘cause of the crazy shit that I did in a day
Shit, let’s just listen for days
And all you haters, get off my dick!
‘Cause your grip gets in the way!!!

[Hook]
WHO’S GONNA BE
The thought that gets me off tonight?
Baby, come and get me off tonight
Close your eyes and lift me off tonight!
5-4-3-2 to the One!
I ain’t tryna stop until my eyes try to run!
From not blinking and tryna Ice-Grill the sun!
IT’S JUST ME AND MYSELF IN THIS BITCH!!
IT’S JUST ME AND MYSELF IN THIS BITCH!!!
