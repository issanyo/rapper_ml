[Verse 1]
Let's embark on a question mark
Not sure if you could, then I suggest you start right here

You can't deny it if it's real
You trying to conceal what you hide on the other side of the veil
Her pretty face I see in 3D squares, her eyes are transparent, she can see me clear
I wired myself to her like, "Can we leave here?"
She said, "No problem, just as long as you don't leave me here"
I said be easy dear, we can dare rearrange the vibe and just dive into time with our dangerous minds
Maybe I can convince you to change your mind
I wrote my name in the skies with my aim in my eyes
So why would you think I'm spitting game or a lie
You'll never find someone that's insaner than I

[Hook]
She's a geeky kind of freaky and I like that
I won't get lost in her eyes, I will be right back, huh
She's a Trekkie, I'm addicted to a Trekkie
She's a- She's a- She's a Trekkie, I'm addicted to a Trekkie

I wanna know what's going on in her body the whole time
Is that such a crime, is that why...
She's a Trekkie, I'm addicted to a Trekkie
She's a- She's a- She's a Trekkie, I'm addicted to a Trekkie

[Verse 2]
She be zoning in our convos
Not no cos-mo-politan, she's in the cosmos
She might know a few things that I do not know
Or be a key to something major they cannot show
Either way I wanna understand, what does she want coming from a man?
She said, "Come again?"
I don't think she was familiar with the male species
I said, Well meet me, let me be...
Your tour guide through reality, glide through the apathy, ride with me happily
The vibe in your eyes got me feeling like a Klingon, this moment I want to cling on
It is what you need to bring on
So we can spring on and be gone from all the frions who only see our name in neon
We on another level, so let your force field down
Liquid vibrations, so of course we'll drown, but we love it

[Hook]
She's a geeky kind of freaky and I like that
I won't get lost in her eyes, I will be right back, huh
She's a Trekkie, I'm addicted to a Trekkie
She's a- She's a- She's a Trekkie, I'm addicted to a Trekkie

I wanna know what's going on in her mind the whole time
Is that such a crime, is that why...
She's a Trekkie, I'm addicted to a Trekkie
She's a- She's a- She's a Trekkie, I'm addicted to a Trekkie

[Verse 3]
She reminds me how deep I am
I see behind me I need a glance, to beneath the chance
That I take, can make my mind faint
Escape from mind rape, OK, I'm fine, great
I know I'm not a loser cause I want to do better
I dress a little better because I want to seem better, but not different
You dress how you feel, and she just undress when I appear
On the caller ID, so I can only guess how she feels, damn
She's a Trekkie for real
Do I wanna be in this pit, what weed did you hit?
This is what happens when we greet with a kiss

Miss...whoever you are, I know who you are, but you know

[Hook]
She's a geeky kind of freaky and I like that
I won't get lost in her eyes, I will be right back, huh
She's a Trekkie, I'm addicted to a Trekkie
She's a- She's a- She's a Trekkie, I'm addicted to a Trekkie

I wanna know what's going on in her body the whole time
Is that such a crime, is that why...
She's a Trekkie, I'm addicted to a Trekkie
She's a- She's a- She's a Trekkie, I'm addicted to a Trekkie
