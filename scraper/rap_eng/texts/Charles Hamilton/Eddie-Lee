[Verse 1]
Doctor told my mother she was pregnant with a boy
She was hoping for a girl, so that segment was enjoyed
Cause she hoped for a girl, so she could know it was a boy
Over my shoulder with the void, so I know it's destroyed
What is it this time? Memories of hidden reaches?
Kissing and secrets of getting between
The visions are seen as the percentage of the dimensions of which we...
Visit, when we listen to the true shit of which niggas written
Bitch, is you kidding?
This is a ridiculous written
I'm shitting when I'm writing
So I guess I'm spitting when I'm wiping
If you niggas get to biting, I don't think niggas'll like it
Unless you sit on a shit diet, quick try it
So sick, I am
But my middle name sounds like a hit guy pickup driving
I am a Midwest baby, but step maybe
That's how I get rid of stress, crazy

[Hook]
I love my life, I love my love, but my middle name sucks
Deadass though
If I was me, horribly, Eddie-Lee
Eddie-Lee, Eddie-Lee, Eddie-Lee
Eddie-Lee, Eddie-Lee, Eddie-Lee

[Verse 2]
My middle name's cooler than most rap names
But a little lamer, so choosing a dope rap name
Wasn't that easy, until I found a perfect stage name
On my birth certificate, word
I maintain nervous, shame, shame
I heard the game
Hang with nerds who bang the keyboard until only one word remains
SONIC
Yeah, the blue guy is back
You die laughing, you die on wax
A big fucking candle, big ember straight leaking on you
The kick drums and Anna Molly tweaking on you
I spit dumb, Brandon is probably speaking on you
Haters is stupid he said, no more speaking on you
A Charles Hamilton beat just straight leaping on you
And my middle name, Rodney King beating on you
I go ridiculism when I speak with a sliver
So watch how you speak to a nigga, go figure, come on man

[Hook]
I love my life, I love my love, but my middle name sucks
Deadass though
If I was me, horribly, Eddie-Lee
Eddie-Lee, Eddie-Lee, Eddie-Lee
Eddie-Lee, Eddie-Lee, Eddie-Lee

[Verse 3/ Outro]
There's so much more to being the only one
Who feels the way I do, there's no escaping you

But maybe I should rest inside my cave of insecurity
And un- such certainty
There are no words for me

I'm never going away
Never going away
I'm never going away
Never going away from you
Never going away
Never going away
I'm never going away

I love my life, I love my love, but my middle name sucks
Deadass though
If I was me, horribly, Eddie-Lee
Eddie-Lee, Eddie-Lee, Eddie-Lee
Eddie-Lee, Eddie-Lee, Eddie-Lee

What it is
Mike, Jose, Kilmore, Brandon
Lost another one of y'all niggas
Y'know, Charles Hamilton
