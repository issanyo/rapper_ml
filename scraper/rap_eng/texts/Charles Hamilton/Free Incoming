[Intro]
I like to see myself as a pretty nice guy. Maybe too nice, you know
Sometimes I give out my phone number to people that ... ordinarily I
Wouldn't give my number out to. Just to prove I'm a nice guy

[Verse 1]
Yo, I get a million calls a day
I ain't Stevie, don't nobody call to say
"I love you" or say "Charles is great"
It's either "Charles, you're fake" or "Charles, you're away"
Some people call cause they need something
Interrupting me while I'm trying to read something
Instead of leaving an outgoing message
Can y'all make jokes on my outgoing message
Charles, you're too long
I like your new song
It's what me and my girl play when we get our groove on
If I change my number, I will get more shit
Bad enough it's 323, not 646
If I get more rich, Imma escape running under a bridge
Cause my shit is like an 800 number
Is it Hollywood if I don't wanna talk at all?
No, I'm just responding to my caller log

[Hook]
I am not here, I'm making my escape
The me you hear is magnetized on tape

Don't you dare touch that phone
When you hear the...
Don't you dare touch that phone
When you hear the...
Don't you dare touch that phone
When you hear the...
Don't you dare touch that phone
When you hear the...

[Verse 2]
*67 when call Miss Second verse
I think I will call this message hurts
Cause it's the truth, I don't hand write
I type in my phone whenever I'm in the booth
Miss 16, somebody text me
You should sample a commercial from Pepsi
It's blue right? Sonic is blue right?
I feel like responding, "Fool, you blew mine"
But who am I? It's Mr. Computer time
I got a Dell and my Mac is super sized
But back to the phone, when I'm back in the zone
Of rapping, a phone explodes from a rapper or hoe
Who's infatuation is to snatch from the throne
The pink cat who is home when the track is in motion
It's fucked up, because I have these emotions
See why I'm happy alone but unhappy alone

[Hook]
I am not here, I'm making my escape
The me you hear is magnetized on tape

Don't you dare touch that phone
When you hear the...
Don't you dare touch that phone
When you hear the...
Don't you dare touch that phone
When you hear the...
Don't you dare touch that phone
When you hear the...

[Verse 3]
Might be cause I'm popular
That I get a lot of calls from these gossipers
When in my mind I think to myself, "Watch it Charles
Don't say nothing to end up on a gossip blog"
OK, I chill for a bit
Generic conversation, not sealing my lips
I'm as real as a fist to the face when you get out of line
So I'm sure that you're feeling this shit
Got a deal and I'm rich
But will people give a feel of this shit if my deal didn't exist?
Nope, so meet my nigga Tone
Or meet my nigga Toon who will greet you with the chrome
If ever you get this ridiculous notion
That's it's best if you diss me
You prank callers will never get mentioned
(Your call has been forwarded to an automatic voice message system)

[Outro]
I honestly do feel like I'm a nice guy, I really do. But some of the
Phone calls I get y'all. I swear on everything, I will turn to a
Really horrible person. I try to keep, I try, but motherfuckers hit me
With some dumb shit
And if you feel like I'm talking to you...don't call me. Don't touch
That fucking phone

I am not here, I'm making my escape
The me you hear is magnetized on tape
Protools

Charles Hamilton

So what I need from all of you..is I'm going to need you to prepare a
Letter tonight. Because what happens with the addict is they believe
They're not being loved anymore. But if that was true, you all would
Not be sitting here today
