(Verse)

And with my stupid ass I'm so surprised you ain't deleted me
Instead you hit me back, before I knew it you retweeted me
Ain't no need for secrecy, you know I'm crushing hard as hell
Started with your face, then I was falling for youyour heart as well
If there were heartbreak reparations I would write you a check
Cuz so many men have given you a night to forget
You deserve the opposite, a throne should be your spot to sit
Chivalry ain't dead, it's just so many guys aren't taught the shit
So your Twitter following consist of niggas hollering
And I can't really fault em with your looks you should me modeling
Still it must be weird to be the center of attention
Especially with all the snakes that enter in your mentions
And I don't wanna claim to be your knight in shining armor
I'm just a decent man but I believe in finding karma
So let's discuss music while we sipping cold beers
Got me lost in the haze, but my vision's so clear


(Chorus)

Let me help you understand just what your eyes do
There ain't another woman that I want in my view
And I would feel so honored if I made you just blush
Had to kick a quick verse for my favorite sup crush
Let me help you understand just what your eyes do
I already bought a ring, so when we saying "I do?"
But really I'd be honored if I made you just blush
Had to kick a quick verse for my favorite sup crush
