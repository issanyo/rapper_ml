"I can't believe it's not butter!", when referring to the flow. Niggas swear they murderin' my flow! Like, no! I know how to do it! I just don't like to do it often. So, move off the block when I get Lofton with it. Number 7 from Cleveland, nigga. Better believe a nigga when ain't reading, nigga. Who's this Indian chick now ridin' my dick? She look like her thighs are kinda thick, but I'm tryna spit. So I'll ignore you. And come back when it's time to. 'Cause I don't know the context, and I don't know what to rhyme to.  (me) "But I'm having mad fun!" (SEGA) "It's not enough. Gotta get a lot of love, until I get a love of my own." So roll up and get in the zone, while a nigga like to spit these freestyle poems. Peace out, hoes. You need now know who the greatest of all time is. With his freestyling prose

Not enough
Sometimes too much is not enough
Not enough
Sometimes too much is not enough
Not enough
Sometimes the rush is not enough
But let me tell you
It's been a long time!
(sometimes I wonder)
It's been a long time!

I learned how to rap from Beck. Now, I disrespect rap every time I rap from the head. Like, "Y'all can't possibly get better than this, so talk your jewels and 'Versace!' ...while I rap to this little Punjabi!". And she might be Egyptian. Just depends on the lobby: that little folder on my hard drive that "got me". It's crazy how I'm esoterically talking to me, while y'all are TERRIBLY talking to me. Yo. Off the leash goes this little beast (idiots, trying to get with me). It's really hard to get with a dude who's really bizarre and wishing beats to come back and kick frees for him. So now, beat! Can you spit what I spit? 'Cause I don't think you can... you're stupid, and I don't give a shit. 'Cause I made you. I'm like a bad parent. (laughter) just get mad while you're staring

Here's the moral: if you don't have enough, then grab enough. And rap till it's enough. But, since most rappers don't give a fuck what I spit, I don't give a fuck either. Let me in a mosh pit. It's not enough to make the beat. (It's) not enough to spit. It's not enough to mix. It's not enough to be on your own dick. So hold it, for a moment or two. While I try spit a poem to you. I feel like I'm frozen in the booth, because all my thoughts are (just) stable. (and) Sterile. I don't care as long as Merrill Lynch... or Meryl Streep just comes through and BARELY carries me over the street while I'm 6-feet deep (on E). Just like that one time when I fought a Mali. Then I fought a dude. Then I ended up outie. In the hospital. Wow-ie! Smoking on California. I'm Audi. Fuck it
