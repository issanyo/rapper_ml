[Verse 1: Charles Hamilton]
Ayo n-n-n-niggas never wanna give credit when credits due
So they forever make me get better instead of lose
And any amount of money motherfuckers is makin
They can wager it on a battle better believe I'll take it
And in the event of me losing the second option
Just put the mic down right now and get it poppin
B-But I'm a cool cat and won't make it to that level
So I'm a stick to the drums b-base and the treble
B-b-b-but if you should fuck with nate then it's trouble
F-f-f-fuck us for real I'll pop your face like a bubble
The no gunplay just straight to the knuckles
Great with the hustle sell a lake to a puddle
Do you understand what I mean
I'll beat you with a branch from your family tree
You see the way we get down son you don't want it
And rob you like chris brown clown ya'll run it!

[Hook:]
Nah homie whatchu mean whatchu mean
I wasn't clear enough? Did I stutter or something?
D-d-d-d-did I st-st-stutter or something?
Did I st-st-stutter-st-st-stutter or something?
Nah shawty whatchu mean whatchu mean
I wasn't clear enough? Did I stutter or something?
They say I talk a little bit fast
But if you listen a little faster maybe you can catch up bitch!

[Verse 2: Charles Hamilton]
P-p-p-people always sayin Charles you can sell
Lyrically you are a nuisance but you can't tell
I wanna beat they ass till my two hands swell
Yeah hit em upstyle like Blu Cantrell
B-b-b-but since the new year I'm a new man hell
My team tight no way my crew can't gel
Like the Wu-Clan the Ku Klan we roll OD
You don't hold heat get a crew man hell!
N-n-n-niggas want me for free but relax
Me and my team proceed but lean back
No need to repeat the scene I've seen that
I'm a beat makin beast you need me scream back
D-d-dudes are some fooly fools of whos pop
Truth is the new 2pac you not
And when these fools flop you gon see whos hot
Charles the rap huey freeman from the boondocks you got it!

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Yung Nate]
F-f-f-flamin faggots thought they could battle with the irrational
Complicated compatible spittin I l-l-laugh at you
I undeniably spit fire without you tryin
You might need to put your rhymes on the trash can diet
C-c-c-cannot be converted manipulated and murdered
Destroy yourself if you've heard it invincible is the verdict
K-k-k-killin killas with german rulers I shoot for losers
Pop the tool just to remove his medulla
You you you niggas cannot see him demolish him or defeat him
Your resembling feces when compared to the demon fetus
I'm a? put em up and I'm rippin em
A million niggas out there now I'm sick of em I'm sicker than
Ya'll sweeter than lickerish everything I have's ridiculous
That's why I don't mind sendin these bullets through your ligaments
Fall back ya'll niggas don't want no beef
Me and Charles choppin niggas on this Charlie brown beat

[Hook]
