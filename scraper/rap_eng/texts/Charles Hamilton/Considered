My closest friends know I go in. No one is as focused as this kid and his kin. My kinfolk is older. Them folks is dope with they spoken word but no one knows what I see say, hear, say, feel on every day and occasion. No mistakes have been made yet so the only mistake is sin. The moment that I decide to go in you will notice him. But I already went in, denying his sentences. Why don't i try living again? Then my living is livid because I'm living again. Telling niggas not to return because I got pot to burn

These are not bars, these are sentences. Some would say these are hot bars but if they get mentioned again in a conversation the problem it's making is how not to become the conversation of the biz, even though I am. Deep in my holded-hand, they're golden and molded, damn. My exclamations. Yes, you can bet I've been dating satan and it's been making me itch. God damn that bitch. As much love as I have for her hips, I just want to laugh in the crib with the baddest chick. And if that's a sin, why rap again? God damn

Yo, Rih. I guess we can talk to each other like homies since you a track that I flipped. And last time I was rapping as if I needed practicing. Now I'm back on my shit. What happened to this? The communication we would make. People named "We Are Great." But maybe it's just a deeper connection that doesn't require us having sex. Yes, I've given into another sin. And if you were sent from God, the music that I made was simple for your bod. [To my God's creation. We/you made it.]
