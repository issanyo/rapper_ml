[Verse 1]
My little man, I know how high you hold me
I'm your homie, but I don't know me
Or at least I didn't
I'm living
For only my vision
If only 5 minutes were sufficient
Maybe that could save our friendship
But we're family so I know we ain't finished
This is.. me sending out a kite to my little cousin
This is nothing
But a different discussion
For us sense
What sense does it make for me to grow up and not
Show love to the closest thing I had to a son?
My little cousin!
You showed me that the things I thought were real wasn't
You're too smart for your own good
But I understand you. Any other input is no good
I damn near raised you but I'm not around now
But I don't think you should frown now
Wow

[Verse 2]
You was my homegirl, Bonnie to my Clyde
Never paid attention to how you were right by my side
Whenever I texted you
I forever respect you
I thought I could never get next to you
I didn't see how much you love me
I was stuck on the sluts who loved to fuck me..
And just be my bucket of lust
But what seems to bug me
Is how through all this you still trust me
That cuts deep!
I'm sure I fucked your head up
Cause you fucked mines up saying this was all a set-up
You were watching as the hoes were jockin'
Not plottin', just secretly wishing that I would stop it!
Now you're gone
Another man has your heart
So, romantically we can't grow
And I gotta stop flirting
But

[Verse 3]
I owe you a lot, I show you nothin'
Actin' like we ain't go through nothin'!
I treat my memories like they lies though I know it wasn't
And you look at me so disgusted
Sorry, man
I ruin dreams but you and me make a beautiful team
Too many scenes of screams and dark things
Make me
Think of you less
In a blink I can test
What you about
You remind me I'm the best..
That's not fair, I owe you more
For all the things you've showed me, I could show you more!
You're superhuman, you can go through doors!!
You're supersonic, your mind is a Pro-Tools board!!!
Crazy how I feel no respect when
I gaze at my own reflection
This is more than a Pro-Tools session
I'm staring at my own reflection
Yes!
