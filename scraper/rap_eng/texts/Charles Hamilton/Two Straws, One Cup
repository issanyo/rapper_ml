(Robin Thicke - Intro)
L-L-Los-Lost without you
Can't help myself
How does it feel?
To know that I love ya baby
Love ya baby
Love ya baby
Love ya baby...

(Charles Hamilton - Verse one)
It's gotta feel splendid
After last night, dear God I feel winded
Watch how you deal with it
Ah, It's real sensitive
Give it a kiss real quick
You wore me out, I had it up for ages
Read the signs around me, added up the pages
Bled in silence
Startin' to feel genius if you see the connection between my heart and my penis
I'm comin' from a genuine place
In you, In Do's and Don'ts of when ya livin' in a place
Of a guy whose rhythm was a waste and you dance your ass off
A new chance to laugh off ya blue ranch of sad thoughts
Who could you lap on, cry on, let my right arm be the one that you rely on
Let bygones be bygones till we say bye.. And be gone

(Hook)
She wanna walk around the house with no clothes on..
So I can be like "That's mine"..
And she can be like "That's fine"..
When I give her a smack on the back side
You wanna roll with me, you wanna roll with me
Take ya to another level explore with me
You wanna go with me, come on and go with me
You can learn everything you wanna know with me

(Charles Hamilton - Verse 2)
You pretty like much.. That sums it up
What does destiny want from us?
She must want you to have a child
Which goes beyond saying
But yeah I got used to that it's wild
It'll be a long day when we finally decide to conceive
Just like that time when you decided to believe
Guided by the promises and fights in which I bleed
To be the slightest bit of quiet in which you could dive into the sea
Feelin' free
Strivin' to be glidin' in the breeze
Jet skii's
I'm feelin' like you've been set free, let me, XP, rest ease
Why am I busy? I gotta keep a USB of more hits than a UFC
I know you do get me, so when it's time to punch in the clock
Just go with me and you with a blunt on the block

(Hook)
She wanna walk around the house with no clothes on..
So I can be like "That's mine"..
And she can be like "That's fine"..
When I give her a smack on the back side
You wanna roll with me, you wanna roll with me
Take ya to another level explore with me
You wanna go with me, come on and go with me
You can learn everything you wanna know with me

(Charles Hamilton - Verse 3)
I out grew the broken heart
I doubt you hold a part that was about to get broken off
It's like you write the how-to when it comes to dealin' with what comes out my mouth, boo
Proud of you is a new power noose out of top
Crushin' her ear because it touches the fear
Me and you are royalty, I guess we're allowed to be people
So how can you be proud of ya equal..
Was that too loud for the people?
Or should we should share our stares in the snare
Walk on air when the glares get flared
There
More hearts in the air than a carebear
There, there
Not tryin' to console you, just pointin out the carebears while I hold you
They're there, there, over there
It's type hot
We outta here, no carebears on my block
