[Verse 1]
What's it like to be the odd man out
Rephrase, I am the oddest man out
My two friends are never letting me out again
When I get back they will never pout again
I don't know why I doubt to begin with
I shine bright like the mouth of a dentist
All I do is hear "Wow" from the fences
Benches, bleachers and speakers
There he is, Mr. America
A nightmare could disturb America
As You can see I overflow a river
John Elway couldn't over throw a nigga
Rover go fetch while I Polar cold shivers
This hot ass beat that no one could kill
Well, they tried
But no one could quiver the boots on this shit
The truth it's this sick

[Chorus]
If you ain't me index to the sky
If you ain't me index to the sky
Go 1, 2, 3 - not it
Go 1, 2, 3 - not it
"I heard Charles got the coodies"
I got my coodie shots, I can do a lot
1, 2, 3 - not it
1, 2, 3 - not it

[Verse 2]
Not the one you want to try your luck with
Pot to piss in? Nigga, "You can't buy a bucket"
Tenth grade catch me cyber cuffin'
Now I drink black Merlot in case I get tired fuckin'
Niggas is trash when they enter a retired something
Now look at that bar for a minute
Still a virgin been hard for a minute
Still absurd been Charles for infinite
Can I hear some applause from you bitches
Rick James when using the bitch name
The backwards Jordan in the studio, 54
This rap shit is golf on a mini course
Meaning you all know that I can jam
But I'm flyer than eagles with a bogey in my Hand
Now bitch, drive my cart to the next hole
I'm a fucking athlete from the get go

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
I get it in early like Kellog's
Got hoes dying for someone to buy they tell-all
Okay, fine I'll wear my reading goggles
Just don't leave out how much semen you swallow
And for the record, that was really fair of me to say
But I know I'll catch hear for it either way
Like being guarded by an All-Star defense player
Unfortunatley you can't stop me in air
I'm not Roy, I didn't say in Ayer
But I'll sample him for being an instigator
I think I did - just not this song
You try to guess it, you just got this wrong
I been getting jiggy since Ziggy
I'm Charlie, definition of Gnarley
I bring cool to the word retarded
Like the Interscope urban market
Hard hit


[Hook]
