[Verse 1]
Hello, so here I am
Standing, Newport butt in my hand
I always tell people to chill
But it ain't easy to chill when you keeping it real
Something tells me to be eating a pill
But I sleep with a chill
No need for a thrill
When I beat my pillow
For real though
Getting my point across more important than the I'll flow
To me at least, I love writin'
Bug writing to mind somebody that loves fightin'
What I am is something phenomenal
Something that I don't know
One thing that I don't know
Is how to play Dominos
I dunno maybe I'm better at stacking the collapse
And that's when action rappin' happens
I imagine and it looks real
I wrote this in my phone
So imagine how my book feels

[Hook]
And I got no swagger at all
No swag what so ever
But I got that kinda uh oh clever
That can make you feel like you only but so clever
I guess I got the swaggerless swag
I guess I got the swaggerless swag
I guess I got the swaggerless swag
I guess I got the swaggerless swag

[Verse 2]
Oh shit now I'm [? ] tuning into my zone
Don't zoom in
Blimps in the air
Signs saying "you win"
Times Square in the future is what you win
Flashing lights, everybody sober
Focused minds can bring everybody closer
Everybody knows his or hers role
No sir, don't nobody want to fight
Beef is over
Reaching over
Grabbing ya honey bun
Everybody rich no asking for money son
That's when the cat with number 1 tracks
Comes back in, plaques with another one
Which one?
What a fronter, what a stunner, what's his number?
I wonder was I this hot last summer?
If so bummer
I'm bigger than a Hummer
So you can't gas me, yes I'm a runner

[Hook]
And I got no swagger at all
No swag what so ever
But I got that kinda uh oh clever
That can make you feel like you only but so clever
I guess I got the swaggerless swag
I guess I got the swaggerless swag
I guess I got the swaggerless swag
I guess I got the swaggerless swag

[Talking]
Yo you have no idea how hard it is to walk
I been running all my life
Well I guess it's natural
I never been confronted with [? ]
I gotta stop running
Then again when you get that feeling to move
You gotta move
That's natural for me too
All my enemies are honestly characters in the zone
That I choose to visit
It don't matter but not seeing them coming
Focusing on em too hard
They get the best of you
Not for long tho
Outta here!

[Hook]
And I got no swagger at all
No swag what so ever
But I got that kinda uh oh clever
That can make you feel like you only but so clever
I guess I got the swaggerless swag
I guess I got the swaggerless swag
I guess I got the swaggerless swag
I guess I got the swaggerless swag

I'm a bad mother shut ya mouf
You'll like me hater shut ya mouf
You'll like me hater shut ya mouf
You'll like me hater shut ya mouf
