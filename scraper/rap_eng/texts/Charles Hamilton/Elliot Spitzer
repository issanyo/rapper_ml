I must’ve got it twisted then. All I’m doing is listening. The chick I wish to get it in with is distant with her grin. But I turn it upside-down and Mia Khalifa the shit to death. God damn, I've been seeing a diva with my flesh in my hand. I'm a distant man. I lost myself again, lost in lust. But it’s awesome, lust. Because the lust leads to awesome love with a touch. When lust grows from lust to love, all I have to do is fuck that shit up. And she will already know the depth. And I hope what I know is next, is next

I’m getting fat, Uncle. At the same time my life look wack, Uncle. And that’s what’s back, Uncle. Depression and crap, Uncle. Buy the fact is, I might have to rumble if you have to crack a knuckle to check me. I’m a grown-ass man, dog. And I ain't doing nothing to disrespect thee. And I’m saying that directly. I don't want to have to beef. I don't want none of that shit, man. I think you fit in a bigger picture that can withstand this shit. And if you can't, then it's different. Damn! And that’s from a certain beginning. And I’m not trying to hurt the beginning

I work hard with a perfect scar. Now all this work is a hard bra. Let me unfasten it, Shoom. Back in the room is the cat with the DOOM tattoo on his back. Having that is what has me as a groom. Actually, not as nasty as a dude who would eat that cat
But I have been eating mad cat. Specially, fat cat. Lyrically, Phat Kat. Calling him out, but that's wack. Nigga, I’m trying exist in the list of the 5, which means 5 don't exist until I can get to the 9 of the guy who did this shit
