[Verse 1]
And as I sent you a message on aim
Regret came strong, all day long
What pesters your long frame
Is never gonna make since to me
Especially knowing that you should be naked with me
We make history and call It out
Every kiss is what this song I all about
I remember being you Tyrant with kindness
High as a sky then, trying to define It
Both, It and whatever this life Is
I call It perfect, You call It Idol worship
Survival on earth Dyer, Why the curtains
With every sunrise I strive to be the one... for you
But all those made in the image of semi-perfections
Didn't really get the directions you live in
Gifted with the lessons you pitch
And heaven missed when the sent a message I call Bliss
Intricately when It was you, I was with

[Hook]
I can’t find anything wrong with you, that’s the problem
I still feel leaving was wrong to do, I'm serious
But I wanna wear silly hats, and teach you how to play a hello kitty Guitar
And teach you how to play a hello kitty Guitar
And teach you how to play a hello kitty Guitar

[Verse 2]
My worst nightmare to date was last night
November 23, I remember what I heard
You and your tender Curves, right there In my face
Spinning curbs with your new man, damn
I finally got the nerve to tell you that Its you I want
But Hi there and a light glare from space
Provided the sight of a guy who’s twice my height
All height to be the face who you care for, there for
I had the lost puppy expression on my face
The sight you’ve been longing to see
Since me taking my belongings to leave
After saying you were belonging to me
Honestly, this song shouldn’t be
Strong Is the belief that you’re gone
And I shouldn’t keep prolonging
The grief of you no longer with me
But...
Like the fog in the streets when I’m a jeep
It’s on I’m gonna keep until were heating up the bong
Feed me your love until I'm gone
I'm feeling hog-ish, Greedy, I hope you still need me
I'm leaping to the chance of being in the sheets
Feeling Frog-ish, no, I cold and Ashamed but yet I'm feeling August
You nude display equates to when the music plays
I can jam to your groove for days
So who wants to get laid?
Me or the groove?
What would you say?

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
I’m the one who wants to be with you
Deep Inside I hope you feel It too
Waiting on the light Of dreams come true
Just to be the next to be with you
I’m the one who wants to be with you
Deep Inside I hope you feel It too
Waiting on the light Of dreams come true
Just to be the next to be with you
(Waiting on the light Of dreams come true)...
