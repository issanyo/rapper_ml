(Intro)
We're just friends, right?
Ah haa

(verse 1)
She's a virgin with sex appeal
I'm not a virgin, but I kept it real
So how should she expect to feel
When a phone conversation made her wet forreal
We ain't even kiss yet, but still
I already know she had special feel
But I'm so Charles Hamilton and she's so Plain Jane
It's kinda like Whitley falling for Dwayne Wayne
She know I ain't strained, but she caught up in the name game
She know the name of dames who thought I spit game
Just to get brain and dip on the train
I told her that, I dig her and she dig me the same
But her friends don't approve
Shit, give me a break
They all single. Watch your "Sex And The City", Okay?
See, we could be lovers or we could homies
But don't let your friends be the reason we lonely

(Chorus)
I know this is new to you
But I just want to grow with you
Cause you don't know what you do for me
(You don't know what you do for me)
Cause you are just too beautiful
And I just wanna move with you
Cause you don't know what you do for me
(I love you more)

(Verse 2)
He's no item
Please don't like 'em
He don't wife 'em
He one night's 'em
Now she don't like 'em
She tried to bet 'em
Friends tried to bad mouth
He won't let 'em
He calls one night
He's all drunk like a retard
But, he's not retarded (Heh)
He hears your friend
So much for romance and no feel again
See, all her friends know, he moves fast as hell
And he smashes well, just ask Shanel
But she gets a glimpse of Charles
And she likes that
He IM's her, so she types back
Smiley faces at the end of all her phrases :)
Either she the one, or I'm caught in the matrix
Fuck it, let the beginning begin
Pink and green pill
But this ?? your friends

(Chorus)
I know this is new to you
But I just want to grow with you
Cause you don't know what you do for me
(You don't know what you do for me)
(You gotta beautiful smile, Baby!)
Cause you are just too beautiful
And I just wanna move with you
Cause you don't know what you do for me
(I love you more)

(Verse 3)
I know that I'm the reason you smile
But they don't wanna see me and you smile
Don't let them think I'll be leavin' you doubt
Leavin' you out, don't believe it's true now
I can only be human, girl
But, I'm a superhero. You my human girl
So let's drift tonight
With a kiss tonight
Anybody comin' at us is the kryptonite
I don't wanna be blue, like a Crip tonight
I just want you to see me in a different light
I wanna know all of the litte shit you like
What your favorite color is and what flicks you like
See, I hope this is not a waste
Cause God, it takes a lot of patience
For me not to fall right away
So, Let me out of this place
I'm out of place
I'm in outer space
I just vanished without a trace


(Chorus) x2
I know this is new to you
But I just want to grow with you
Cause you don't know what you do for me
(You don't know what you do for me)
Cause you are just too beautiful
And I just wanna move with you
Cause you don't know what you do for me
(I love you more)
