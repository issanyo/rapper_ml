[Verse 1: Charles Hamilton]
The place, SUNY Sullivan
The space, a puny fuckin' kid
The face on this space, who be buggin' when
He lose another friend, using up my skin
The abuse that shove me in a box
To not reach out, but to be public and be watched
With that said, for every blackhead, pimple, and insecure thought, I write another song, and grin with pure thought
This is pure Charles. Once I bounced it from Pro Tools
MySpace, didn't have high plays, but got high praise
One bright day, the sky was type gray
Checks go next and this guy was like, "Hey, I'm Anthony. I go to the HS you once attended, You're my fave."
I'm like, "It's good to know that someone gets it."
He's a little bit younger, but a kindred spirit indeed
He took a hit of the weed and said...

Plenty of nights I walk alone
In these long pink socks
So put it on my life, I won't steer you wrong
The only brother that I got
I don't know where I would be without my best friend (You tell me)
I don't know where I would be without my best friend

[Verse 2: SHow TuFli]
Do you know what I had to do to get here?
How much I loved and had to lose to sit here?
Well Rosa, I know what you was goin' through
If I was older, I'd probably fall in love with you
Now I'm sittin' in a chair gettin' comfortable
I been growin' out my hair for a month or two
Smoke a blunt or two Five, six, seven, eight
God I'm living great
I'm just trying to celebrate
Every day I'm praying for a better day
I feel selfish
But I couldn't help it
But now I'm here to tell you I appreciate you, and everything that makes you
Life is what you make it, but don't let it make or break you
If they don't give it, take it
And see where it takes you
Cuz you could do anything if you believe you able
Otherwise you believe in fables
And I'm the real deal, Show TuFli, do you believe in angels?

I don't know where I would be without my best friend

[Verse 3: Charles Hamilton]
Nigga, you Tails, I had to run the game first
A.K.A., figure out what my name's worth
Fame hurts when you ain't work
But my mother used to make me wear a change purse
Wasn't like a purse, it was like You know those things the transit cops wear?
And it stops there Man, it's not fair
So many memories for you to witness
With this trip and every city we visit

[Verse 4: SHow TuFli]
Yo, Chuck I do this shit for the love
I don't spit for a buzz
I was sick, body limp, couldn't budge
With a gift, pissed Cuz I couldn't spit what it was
But we knew what it was and what it will be
Spit the shit that made X get hit until they kill me
If my neck was lit, these dudes'd probably feel me
Forget the fake shit, I'mma stay real to me
And hip hop is as real as can be, since double 0
