One of the nicest, with a broom nigga! My wife is in the room, nigga! The wife is my mic! The mic isn't mine, but I'm NICE when it's DOOM, nigga! And that's the fuckin' crisis! I'm the fuckin' nicest! Holdin' on to Isis. My sis, when it's crisis. Lifeless, and I wish that I can get on my stick of a broom, enter a room (and) pick up the shoom of a chick who wishes to be giving me fumes. I'm out of oil, her pockets kinda soiled! She got a diaper on! I know she like the song, but I'm kinda wrong. I'm wifing wrong. The "right" to "wrong". Everything I write is wrong. Now, get along with me!

Who got the nightshift? Like I said, I'm the nicest! I put the right fist in a video, tryna get me dough. Really though? In the city, yo... mad cops is blackin'. Matlock with action. I'm laughing but I have to stop. 'Cause that's basically blackin'. Pataki of the block. The white boy, chilling out making light noise. LightNING noise, to be exact. Every time I get on a track, I pitch crack, and it gets distributed by Universal. Like a circus. Never am I nervous. Kinda perfect. Forever am I worth it. Like Pert is

Or is it L'oreal?

I put my foot down. I look around. No book around. Just a book with a hook in it. Give a good minute of a "good look" to the book. The hood in it. Everybody watchin'! All these hoes jockin'! (waiting for your crisis) Over, again. Second time around. Blowing wind. Never am I found. I'm forever in the blowing wind, so forever am I going in. You know I win when it's time to battle. I ain't had one in a while. Just smile. I get down, and I'm kinda wild. Shout out to my whole team. Profile!
