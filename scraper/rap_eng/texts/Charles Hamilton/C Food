[Intro]
Cleveland, sit down
I want to sing a little song that uh.. kept me going when I had troubles

[Verse 1]
I am thankful for every morning
But I really can't help it, it's boring
To sit still and just chill
What's real, what's made up
I love to just lay up and worry
It's an exercise
When I wanna stretch my mind whenever I have extra time
On my hands, slide from my glands
Drip when I sweat, I'm a sickness in your head
And no, my mind ain't in Disturbia
I just wanna reach out to Suburbia
Let em know colors can being color too
In your radio, your internet, and color tube
So what are you? Just like me
Frightening, I see, why leave?
Just enjoy it, chill, pop pasta on the soul
Stove, and listen to the Rock Lobster

[Hook]
I'm so lonely sitting on top of the world
I feel lonely sitting on top of the world
But you don't own me, I'm sitting on top of the world

*Peter Laughing*
Yeah, you're gonna be okay

[Verse 2]
Smoke clouds are kind of cool
Till I get dehydrated because I kind of drool
But since I'm a weird kind of fool
I write about this shit, therefore I kind of rule
I'm a school, I will learn your ass
You the root of the problem, I will burn your grass
So what's your demeanor
Was it the meaner lyrics
That be dusting on your little puffs cause I'm breathing the ether (?)
Meaning, get down or lay down, dog
I spit rounds and play grounds
Either Rucker when I'm popping the 3
Or kidnapping little Tucker when I'm copping some z's
Watch out for me, don't play kitty with the big boys
I'm from the big city where's there's big noise
Your a car horn pissing off a foghorn
So you can't see me cumming like softcore porn

[Hook]
I'm so lonely sitting on top of the world
I feel lonely sitting on top of the world
But you don't own me, I'm sitting on top of the world

*Peter Laughing*
Yeah, you're gonna be okay

[Verse 3]
What more can I say to convince
I'm more than a player only playing defense
Cause he can't slang it, doesn't think he'd catch a pop fly
Watch my movements, I'm a hot guy
Top 5 dead or alive
Cause I do it like the rap grateful, dead or alive
And they trying to compete
So its way more than me trying to rhyme on the beat
Yeah, I know I can do it
I can flow, I ain't stupid
Yeah you think oh, I'm so Mr. Impossible
You think so, so do I, sue me
Cause even controlling my Z's you won't undo me
Get a computer, learn the hotkeys
And holla back to tell me no one can stop me
I'm out b

Yehaw, remind me of Cleveland baby!

[Hook]
I'm so lonely sitting on top of the world
I feel lonely sitting on top of the world
But you don't own me, I'm sitting on top of the world

*Peter Laughing*
Yeah, you're gonna be okay

*Peter Laughing*
Yeah, you're gonna be okay

[Outro]
Charles started drinking. It didn't worry me because I thought that it's normal, kids experiment a little bit at that age and it didn't take long for him to get into associating with those who were taking drugs
