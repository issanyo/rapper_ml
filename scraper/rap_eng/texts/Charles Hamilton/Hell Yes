[Intro]
If you spell love backwards
You get evol
You spell evil backwards
You get live
Let's live love

By the way, you spell live backwards and put a D, you get who I am

[Verse 1]
I'm in the throne, I live alone
Gon get the phone whenever nigga jones
But every now and then, I need a special friend
Simple with complexity, so it will never end
But then again, my kingdom is underground
And no one will come around without Theo running around
My queen is the queen, but I need another soul
Another dimension to put me deep within the zone
The inter-scene she enters in
Like Monica's first day of an internship
Now my heart is full of love, my eyes are full of lust
She is lust, she said try cause you must
My inner vampire wanna bite her for a rush
She leans her neck, her desire is for us
So I started with a kiss on the cheek
And drank her essence until it dripped from my teeth

Don't let me scare you baby
Wait a minute, shouldn't I be scared of you

[Verse 2]
I try to pull away, her blood was too sweet
Touched her, my two teeth, too deep
We moved free through the next level
Cause it's about time to send meth the devil
She said, "Daddy, you made me
I'm bad for you, come save me"
Just the sound of her voice drove me crazy
Boy I hope mother nature doesn't hate me
She dug her claws in my back when I stroked her
This ain't a dream cause she's actually closer
Then closer should be allowed to be
So girl, don't get loud with me
You asked for the thrashing that ass is getting, this is the good life
So there's no bad positions, we have the living
So we could fly to satellites
While we living in hell, let's die in Paradise

Open up
Baby girl, open up
I know you feel the night, so baby girl, open up
Open up, Open up, Open up, Open up

[Verse 3]
She realized the danger of the passion
But what the hell, she came here for the passion
And I'm no stranger for the passion
Handcuffed to the bed, the channel was the reaction
I can't move, she's got me bound
Our chemistry is science and she got me down
But I love it, don't rub it, be gentle
Uncuff it, now you can continue
The wind blows, I'm in you, window
Open in in you, window
And you begin to get low
Skip the imaginary shit no
Shit, no
Hell no
Well, no
Indecision got me living in this hell so...
Let's stop, I know you did it well so
Love is a pit and I already'd fell so don't ask me

[Outro]
Have I ever had it like this before
Have I felt the supernatural kiss before
(?) like you've never been kissed before
Get away from me
Get away from me
Get away from me
