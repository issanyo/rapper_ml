There's something about The Darkside. My heart cannot lie. I don't want to be a part of... you guys. The masses. The social aspect of life kinda kisses my ass, and my ass isn't wet. Alright? I don't wanna be raped. I just wanna be someone ladies would date. Lately I may find myself to be attractive. But in the next second... it's just like magick. It disappears. But I'm Magic. Listen here. If I disappear, what will you listen to, peers? I don't want to be overdubbed. I want to be OverLoved. But then again, I'm over. With love. I'm done with it. All I wanna do is run shit... AND I DON'T WANNA RUN SHIT! I guess I'm done with living. (looks to The Left) That's just my life. I'm under my decision, (just) smashing my wife

When I come down from the Heaven I found
WHERE'D THE VALLEY GO?
No one is around, and I STILL feel down
So
WHERE'D THE VALLEY GO?
There's these pills I have to take...
WHERE'D THE VALLEY GO?
Same ol' song from yesterday
I DON'T KNOW IF I CAN TAKE IT...

I have issues with spending. The people who I've been befriending are finding it as a possible ending. (Dear Joe...) I don't want to spend up your cash, I just find it hard for me to make things last. So... the aftermath of THAT is people don't like me being around because they have to spend. And I've been practicing not living half the sin that I've been promoting. But at the same time, I'm open and hoping that somebody can help me. With all of this shit that belts me. Whips me. Listen to me. A kiss from me is so sweet. As a matter of fact, you can OD. But I'll take that distance thing, too. The thing that makes me distance me from you. No kisses in the deep wind from me, as long as I know I can begin

I feel like I was meant to be this depressed. I don't understand it yet. Symphonies, and a hand up the dress of The Fat Lady make(s) me that crazy. This opera is going down. And at the same time, I don't flow (as) profound; the way I used to. I like my flow now, because it's... casual. And usual. And others won't like it. They're all gonna say, "Charles, we know you're psychic. All you gotta do is say some fly shit. Get high with it. You'll probably like it more than you do now." At the same time, I'm new now. And I don't know what I knew then, so... I move into a new town. Hopefully, there I'll be safe to go in
