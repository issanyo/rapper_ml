It’s been a while since I felt like this.  Since the Tarot deck got dealt like this. Cappin’ it, gotta knelt. Sent my fist up to the Sun, let it melt. I might have said a prayer, but the sixes are everywhere. Where’s God at? Where’s the problem with God saying “Stop that.” when I’m rocking and rapping off the top hat? God, let me fall back. Let me fall, as a matter of fact. And Satan, make room for me. I’m making it hot, shaking the pot. Shaking the dice. Shaking in my boots, just to tell you the truth. I’m falling in love with me but everyone thinks I’m ugly

I just want to smile
I haven’t done that in a while
So people, never mind my smile
My smile has become my style

It’s been a while since I was allowed to feel. The power I yield is on sour. How does it feel to be louder than Ally McBeal mixed with Bowser? A female boss. And I email females when they want to take it off. I say I’m soft. And I don’t get tested so that’s not questioned. But when I get tested I question the destined. Will my day come? Will I wake up saying “One, one of these days…” to my hun? Honey, may we play? Replay this song every time I’m gone. And if I decide to stay then come on, let’s jam. Let’s dance! Let me hold you with my left hand. Scold our daughter with the right

I just want to smile
I haven’t done that in a while
So people, never mind my smile
My smile has become my style

It’s been a while since depression left. I want to draw it up like Etch-a-Sketch. Just to make it disappear with the shake that I do of the pot. Or the dice, when I’m cooking rice. I got to stop living life to be living life. Then living life says “That isn’t right!“ So while I’m living life I’ve got to get a wife. I’ve got a bad chick but she I know she ain’t living right. While I’m living life, living life ends. And the life you’re living is my end. You have normalcy. You have importan-cy. No force from me. The very normalcy that you’re seeking is boring to me. So we can come through, shine some more. I am the Sun, word to your spinal cord

I just want to smile
I haven’t done that in a while
So people, never mind my smile
My smile has become my style
