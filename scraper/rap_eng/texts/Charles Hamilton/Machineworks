I came in this world knowing no one
Go to space crack a cold one
Crack a code and then no runs from the other team
Cause they all a fucking dream
What a fucking scene
While I fucking steam
Three curses, what does it mean
Don't mean to say fuck but when I wake up
On a spaceship all I see is (grace but?)
No need for ashes, no need for smoking
No need to ask if i can go and provoke it
Stroke it like a golfer and a caddy
Aliens calling me daddy
Did I make them? Did I save them?
I don't hate them
I just wish I did not have to psychically rape them
Just to make love to it, do it

Look at her big booty working the machine
Working the machine working the machine
Look at her big booty working the machine
Working the machine working the machine
Working that, working that, working that machine
Working that, working that, working that machine
Working that, working that, working that machine
Working that, working that, working that machine

I was once prophesthetic
Or whatever the word is but I just made it up. Sorry
Proposition to be in a hot position
Under some chick while she rides me In zero gravity
What a great dream
Now what has she done to me? put a spell on
Put every body under me while I'm under them
So she's the queen. I have no choice but see what she means
When she says "yo you're being mean
Therefore your face should be between my legs"
My god there is no God. Just my says, as Simon
I'm designing inside mind a different kind of lining
To chime in

Look at her big booty working the machine
Working the machine working the machine
Look at her big booty working the machine
Working the machine working the machine
Working that, working that, working that machine
Working that, working that, working that machine
Working that, working that, working that machine
Working that, working that, working that machine
