[Intro]
Yo...
Hope you're nodding your head, wherever you are

[Verse 1]
I take hip hop to the cleaners
Every time I drop my thesis, peep it
God is a woman and I got aborted
Don't ask my opinion, it's not important
I always tell Niggas try pot and snort shit
And tell women touch my cyclops and force it
But chill, this here is more than just skill
A lifetime decision I'm given so cut the frills
Get down and stay in the lay down position
This mouth sprays something way out, you dig it
I get it, practice talking about living
This rap shit has kids walking around bitchin'
That's it quit rapping, kidnap a Jonas
Sit back, relax and get bitch smacked by my focus
This track is a trap if you have the focus
I lift rap when I rap when in fact it's bloated, come on

[Hook]
Nickname gravity, damn it I get down
Nickname gravity, damn it I get down
Nickname gravity, damn it I get down
Nickname gravity, damn it I get down
Damn it I get down
Damn it I get down
Damn it I get down
Damn it I get down
Nickname gravity, damn it I get down
Nickname gravity, damn it I get down
MVP of the highlight reel
Give me all the thoughts that I might feel
Fuck what you've heard dog I'm quite real
I'm so amazed at my highlight reel (4x)
MVP of the highlight reel (+ echo 2x)


[Verse 2]
Biggie on a diet
50 with a trident
Pretty and defiant
You really want to try it
It's simple, but I'll make it simpler, I'm nimbler
10th of November into December
Hold up, I'm ugly, bitches remember
Now I'm on fire, won't kick you an ember
I rap how I want FCC
So I haven't sold a record yet, free me
The best see me and get the heebie-jeebies
I jetski on the beat, you need to be me to receive me
So I'm Hamiltonizing the globe
And I'm humble but can I provide what you know
We're all slaves to a low frequency
So turn the bass up and don't speak to me
She's back with a G-cup implant
You want to get down, sign a pre-nup then dance

[Hook]
Nickname gravity, damn it I get down
Nickname gravity, damn it I get down
Nickname gravity, damn it I get down
Nickname gravity, damn it I get down
Damn it I get down
Damn it I get down
Damn it I get down
Damn it I get down
Nickname gravity, damn it I get down
Nickname gravity, damn it I get down
MVP of the highlight reel
Give me all the thoughts that I might feel
Fuck what you've heard dog I'm quite real
I'm so amazed at my highlight reel (4x)
MVP of the highlight reel (+2 echo)
