Her eyes bare witness to the prejudice.
All she wants to acceptance.
Her intelligence is a wildfire.
No one is moisturized.
In fact, she might have killed you.

In fact,
she killed you.

You hate her just by looking at her.
You lust her by thinking about how she looks.
You can never love her.

And she can never love me, because she doesn't even think I'm real.
She doesn't think I can love her.
She doesn't want to believe I could love her.

I am the doom of an Asian girl.
