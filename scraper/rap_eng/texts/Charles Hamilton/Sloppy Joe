How low can you go? Limbo with a bimbo holding the pole. Not now, though. She’s out cold, like a piss from Lennox Lewis. Just do it. Getting stupid to the rhythm, listen to it. I, Tiger. Then again, fuck him. I fire, move it. Got a flow that’s wet, like a Kotex after sex. I’m after disaster, yes. Trying to end the globe, but not just yet. You’ve gotten obsessed, I hope. I’m dope just like my questions, Socratic Doomer. I’m after you room as a faggots groom her

Mean Mr. Mustard, always making me dance
Mean Mr. Mustard, never taking a chance
You’re such a mean old man, but you’re family, too
You’re such a mean old man, and I’m dancing with you

I’m slick with my tongue and quick with a gun like Mc-DRAW! Damn, I’m pissed off. What are y’all listening for? I’m listening for four. Four more years as if I’m a Black guy that’s not mad at my situation. I’m that guy’s son. The Black guy is the Sun, giving all y’all tans. Giving rounds of applause for those who deserve it. Damn, niggas is intimidating me. Illuminati, them niggas is dating me. Then them niggas that’s hating me is taking me over to Illuminati to body me. Fuck them all. I gotta be the reason why Klonopin is inside of your system

You’re such a mean old man, and I’m dancing with you

Tired of calling beats a bounce. Want to beat my meat to the bounce of a freak. Then I sleep. And she amounts to what’s deep, which is my feet. Kiss my toes, fucking mistletoe. Red from the top like I’m bleeding. If you’re reading my top, I’m hot. Loko like Four, to bring that second verse back some more. Nah, I didn’t write this. I just happen to be smart and then some. With the income of the dim ones. Bristol with a pistol. No K, please don’t wake up. I’m the greatest, what the fuck?
