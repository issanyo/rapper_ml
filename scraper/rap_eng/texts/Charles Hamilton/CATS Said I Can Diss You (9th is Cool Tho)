[Intro]
Mr. Massa, Massa, Massa!
I think you gotta do the
I think you gotta explain the dollar bill thing
I'm just gonna tell everybody else what else it is, you know?
9th, 9th!
We the tag team champions right now
9th wonder and Charles Hamilton
Uh

[Verse 1]
Ross and Jeezy suck Jigga dick
Y'all can tease me I don't give a shit
BMF what up? Come fund this son of a gun
Whether cool or not, I'm still number one
Jada said everyone is garbage, suck it
Balls poppin' in and out of your mouth Mr. Bucket
And one more bar, Drake is Kirby Puckett
Wayne pulled out his weasel and Drizzel happily puffed it
Keri Hilson's substance is sucking dick
And Wack Khalifa gets tea-bagged by his publicist
Shove it bitch, your booty-hole is so big nothing fits
Waka Flocka has sex with a fucking fish
Sword-fish in his ass for spitting trash
Say this shit in a class and get a laugh, them niggas trash
Cudi is ass, went to his show and spazzed
Joe laughed
Quote Ye: "kiss my whole ass," but no way
Skip the whole class, no mistaken I poke Satan and I'm...

[Hook: 4x]
Send shots blocka blocka poppin noggin like I'm not supposed to

[Verse 2]
Ayo fuck Biggie, fuck Pac, he was just with me
I leave Mr. T shitty, no Eric Jerome Dickie
A mobile phone won't roam with me
I'm ill dole-y, I don't need Simone with me
Hey Jam Master Jay, I scratch way faster
Playback has to escape from my rapture
Jazzy Jeff is actually way blacker
May have captured back in the day, but laying black dirt
Em is trash - first, now he's like "that hurt"
Fuck Bishop Bonner and half of that church
I carry niggas so long my back hurts
Yung Nate don't want gun play, he wants cum and tongue play!
He's gayer than Bishop Bonner on a Sunday
What you want Jay, Z or Dilla?
Believe I'm a killer, who else I gotta murder for the scrilla?
Nigga

[Hook: 4x]
