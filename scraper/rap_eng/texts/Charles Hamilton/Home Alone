[Intro]
Yea
One Morning I woke up, and no one was in my house
Wanna Know how it felt?
Uh, yo!

[Verse 1]
I'm the freckle month face of the forgetful face
Who grants mistakes
And whatever is left to decay
Separate, as soon as breakfast is ate
Married in mind that I always staring Through Time
I don't care If you find an error In time It must have been an error in rhyme
My earn run average Is Zip
Just look at the control I have on this shit
Imagine what a trip It is to get found
Witnesses get pissed, look at the ground
Lift the Chick, quick, cause you pick up a sound
Paranoid, then Goes to shit
In this hood at this point they be loading clips
"Who approaching the Whip"
So close to the Pen that If I go in its no little bid
But no Kid, you Macaulay Culkin
My thought be stalking, You can call me Marvin

[Hook]
Sitting In the living room waiting on the Phone to ring
I ain't Got no Company I'm hanging, and I'm looking for a song to sing
I'm Home alone Hanging on the Doorbell
Hanging on the Doorbell
Home alone waiting on the Doorbell
Ding Dong
Ding Dong
Ding Dong
Ding Dong
Yo

[Verse 2]
The Sun peaks in, day one for the weekend
Ring tone Tweakin, Shes Od'n
Who's on my mind, Who's Fucking with me
Just to offend me my Fucking enemy Disrupted my City
With Tough and Gritty Chatter, Whats his name, does It really matter
Does it make me want to snuff him any faster
Fucking Bastard
Can't show stress though
Though I hope his family Dies of Cancer, streapt throat
(how long has it been)
Fuck outta here somebody show this nigga some Fuckin morals
Six rules, Do I need to restate 3 though 8 respect C to the H
Well I thought I said I need too, restate
Yep, I did, back to the future nigga is that what your Use to?

[Hook]
Sitting In the living room waiting on the Phone to ring
I ain't Got no Company I'm hanging, and I'm looking for a song to sing
I'm Home alone Hanging on the Doorbell
Hanging on the Doorbell
Home alone waiting on the Doorbell
Ding Dong
Ding Dong
Ding Dong
Ding Dong

[Verse 3]
I reflect on Stress When I'm on the Deck of rap
Niggas check all text up on deck next
I cypher with myself, I'm a fire but It helps
Fire from the Lighter
Higher to aspire, Quietly but tight
And modestly, Copied the Prophecy
Not to be a lier
But to not cop a plea when the Clock is required to stop
Like those who Can't tell time but have a watch, cause their tired of Getting Clocked
And we still rock, me and myself
My hands are tied, Still
I being the reason the Trinity Is completed
Tell the Past, Bye
Murder someone for Giving tomorrow a black Eye
Try to Escape but using the Sleeping Route
Why don't I just leave the house
Charles Hamilton.....

Sitting In the living room waiting on the Phone to ring
I ain't Got no Company I'm hanging, and I'm looking for a song to sing
I'm Home alone Hanging on the Doorbell
Hanging on the Doorbell
Home alone waiting on the Doorbell
Ding Dong
Ding Dong
Ding Dong
