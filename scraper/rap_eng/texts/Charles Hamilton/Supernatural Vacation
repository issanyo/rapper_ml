[Intro]
I'm ready…
Yo mute that first take
That's crazy
Yeah, Charles Hamilton
Feel me?
You just gotta feel like this song won't exist after you finish listening to it
So you gotta play it again
That's how I try to make people feel
Feel me

[Verse 1]
Uh, one day, Ill disappear from it all
No longer be the voice that you hear in the halls..
Of your mind. Till then I'm as tall as the wall people climb..
To escape from the voice in the halls in your mind
I don't wanna change and leave
I love you, your name is me
I'm Mr. Me too. Yeah I can rip a beat, true
And live in these boots just to kick the sweet truth
If we need music, you and me. Get it?
We can live through song only
3 minutes is a standard song
Sit back and zone out or you can stand along..
With me as i record this
I'm a Maserati with the soul of a Taurus
Humble, but you know what it is
I weave in and out of tracks to go over your wig
I'm the definition of not being sober, which is...

[Hook]
Take a break for just a while
Make mistakes and just be human
Let this just be music
Don't over think for just a while
Take a break just to smile
It's all a dream...
It's all a dream...

[Verse 2]
Smoke clouds, go down in the fire
That won't douse my desire, passion
Music is fine to some rich folks for cashing
But with hope, we'll get close to asking
The hierarchy. To try and start the..
Movement..
Of letting people live for music
See
Its ok to feed your kids from music
If you're real
And inspire kids with music
Don't make em feel different
You missed the mission..
If you use this..
To pollute it
Im no saint
But, don't say..
I don't paint pictures
Who asked you?
You just tattoo
You make your art out of..
Other peoples pain
I use my pain..
To enter the peoples brain
A week, a day
A month, a year
Not someones tears
Just me saying..
What i need to say
We can pray..
*or maybe we can chill
You shouldn't have to pay..
To keep it real

[Hook]
Take a break for just a while
Make mistakes and just be human
Let this just be music
Don't over think for just a while
Take a break just to smile
It's all a dream...
It's all a dream...

[Verse 3]
Im from the bottom..
Like bunions
Thats how i know i run shit
And the game got my thumbprint
Positive I.D
Honestly, i need..
To watch what i say..
Since you watchin what i see
Im not gonna stop me
I can be cocky
But, god didn't drop me..
For me to possibly blind the..
With my ego
I need no leash on myself
My inner beast feels my whelps(welps)
And he feels pity for no one but me
Im so at peace..
When im roaming the streets
Been charles hamilton..
Since the roman and greeks
My home is in egypt
There's no need to speak
Feel me
Ya feel me?
I am the only one that can kill me
But you can hurt me
And that'd kill me
But, being real with me..
Can heal me
Not guilty

[Hook]
Take a break for just a while
Make mistakes and just be human
Let this just be music
Don't over think for just a while
Take a break just to smile
It's all a dream...
It's all a dream...

[Outro]
When you come from..
Being told "you ain't got nothing"
And that you not bout nothin
And that your dreams only come true when you follow people
It makes it really hard to believe that..
The world is yours
So when nas said "the world is yours"…
Took it personal
Felt like he was talking to me
You know what?
I don't care what you say
He was
Deadass woke up one morning and decided im not gonna be judged no more
Im not gonna feel no more pain
Dead ass listen to my music and be feeling like…
Somebody.. else.. is over me… telling me what i should write
You know how that shit feel?
You know what?
Its over
Only person i gotta worry about being real to is me
Charles hamilton
Get it?
Thats all there is to it, man
Im not tryna…
Im not tryna take nothing over
Im not tryna hurt nobody
I don't wanna take it where it might go..
Just let me chill. hah
I don't even smoke weed no more, man
I used to love getting high
Laughing with people
But i overanalyze shit when im smacked
I don't like to be fucked with when im high, man
Don't blow my high no more
Thats why i call this the Supernatural Vacation
Ya dig?
So i just wanna chill…
Charles Hamilton
Im out
