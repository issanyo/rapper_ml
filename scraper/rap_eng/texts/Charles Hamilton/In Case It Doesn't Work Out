[Verse 1]

I been doing Pretty good So far without you
Never had you to Know If It was hard without you
Maybe I did and it just wasn't this lifetime
Ight fine then tell me when Its the right time
For me to handle my Biz
That's what It is
And If I did
Slack on this shit that I plan to ride with
Doin', Which'll be something that will never be ruined
You and Me, we the truest
If I ever ended less than enough
Would you still respect and just rest In the love that I give to you
I'm not a big guru
I just wanna know how to get through to you
Do you Wanna Find out
Or just leave me looking Winehouse
Eyes looking Cried out
Why dont we take this little convo to my house

[Hook]

Dude you sound desperate, What'll happen If you end up getting rejected, Huh!?
Now you sitting On the strangest border, between True Love and Restraining Order
What If she's not that Into
Maybe She's not that Into you
Nigga this not no Interview
Maybe shes not that Into you...

[Verse 2]

Day after Day I get visions of Us
Then a Quick vision of you not Giving A fuck
"Nigga Whats up" I say to the mirror
Why did you just get upset and start twisting stuff up
My own reflection Kinda laugh
Why Is that, cause I just kinda laugh
I'm tryna get insight from this guy in the mirror
And his sight is my sight, I think I got him tight
Smoke and mirrors, Windows surrounded In fire
The Ground getting Higher
If I told you why my mind designs such a fucking Scene
You would Scream
And Seemingly call me a liar, but you exist
Shit, OK
This Is what happens when I don't reminisce For a day
On the Way your like a Florida day, on the fourth of May
Or a way for a porter

[Hook]

Dude you sound desperate, What'll happen If you end up getting rejected, Huh!?
Now you sitting On the strangest border, between True Love and Restraining Order
What If she's not that Into
Maybe She's not that Into you
Nigga this not no Interview
Maybe shes not that Into you...

[Verse 3]

Here It goes
If I hear no, I'mma sit for two weeks feeling like a weirdo
Probably won't want to hear no songs Or be seen on T.V
"Is that weirdo on"
I fear no strong as bouncer at a Club
But when I see her face I go from Mountain to a shrub
I doubt she Shes Gonna bug
If Shes Hearing all the rhymes
Cause there all compliments and she hears them all the time
Me, I'm just a Street kid
Sweet win, Speakin to women, Even If she don't listen
Me being Such a gentle Cat
Shit Is whack but then again Its a bigger track
To race On, Lay Grace on
But If I only had you in the Kitchen With an apronnn
With no make-up on...*Sigh*
