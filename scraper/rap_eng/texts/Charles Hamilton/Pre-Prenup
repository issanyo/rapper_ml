[Intro]
You know the guys often make fun of me and shit...
They say everywhere I go (uhuh)
I always gotta say something to a woman mad extra
Make her fall in love... Sha-leik good lookin' out on the track
It's Charles Hamilton...

[Verse 1]
It could be my fault
Just said the wrong things at the right time
Strong things to make you like my...
Perception on love at first sight
What a flirt right?
Was it worth fights he engaged in?
Days out days in
I wish on a Friday we could stay in order take-out
Spend the end of the day in bliss
Watching Block Buster flicks & all that 1998 movie bullshit
But Misses Business of the lady of whom gave me my first kiss
Mrs Me I'm married to her
So I can't keep my distance
But kisses... that last kiss is why
I don't wanna act like this is the last time we gone kick it
Hate to sound different but dig this

[Hook]
I thought about us for a long long time
I thought about us for a long long time
Maybe I think too much but
Maybe I think too much but
Maybe I think too much but something's wrong

[Verse 2]
Uh...
I can't get distracted
Cause I don't even practice when I proceed to rapping
It has to come as natural as a cactus
If it hurts that means you feel it
Yeah, I am a prick
Why would I try to conceal it?
It's just something that you gone have to deal with
I admire your body
I take the time to caress
Glide on your flesh
My eyes respect your thighs and your breasts privacy
Cause unless my eyes lie to me
Seeing you means your undressed... yes
X-ray Vision
A new form of mental sex
Shit, I built up enough I'm in a rush
To give you loving and I don't give a fuck if it's lust
Cause it is us that enjoy it
Wish it could last longer but the long term... nah
Relationship was the wrong turn
Straight forward and I'm on your curves

[Hook]
I thought about us for a long long time (Word, uhuh)
I thought about us for a long long time
Maybe I think too much but
Maybe I think too much but
Maybe I think too much something's wrong
