(Verse 1)
No, I haven't showered
Come as you are
I've been praying, laying under the stars
No wonder I'm far
My hunger got my stomach so hard
When I shit it's like thunder and gwar
I'm a ra-tard....
I black like Zack, my pun is bizarre
I really just want a guitar
Acoustic..
My wishes only come true in my music
So to my love, I'm sorry I'm so abusive
Hitchhiking
Shooting up in a Buick
Staying down, shake it down
Saying "do it"
Memories of my momma saying I'm useless
Mental torture and still forced to use lips
Then I torture and kill more than my two lips
Get it more when I'm in a morgue for some cool shit
Venom jaws
"Isn't Charles on some new shit?"
Screw this - Eric Cartman
I'm moving

(Hook)
I can wonder why, but I know you hate me, it's fine
It's cool
I don't want to die, but the love created me, it's fine
It's cool
I'm just a dirty white boy
I'm just a dirty white boy
I'm just a dirty white boy
Waiting for the pearly gates to take me right back

(Verse 2)
Same sweatsocks for a year and some change
My songs are my thoughts so you're hearing deranged
The fear of the strange has me hearing my brain
Faith in suicide but fearing the pain
Pissed that gay and queer is the same
I hate Frank Ocean
Here is the drain
And the homo-ass thoughts that peer in my brain
Has me standing right the motherfucking here looking strange
Dearly estranged
I clearly refrain from hearing your name
I want my soul smeared with a chain
I pick up my acoustic and I smile at the thoughts I shared
Psychically, because they're too raw to share
The piano is too heavy to travel with
And the pain I channel
Is too heavy to battle with
No Coke, I am the heaviest accident
You met me when heaven accepted me as their bastard kid

(Hook)

(Bridge)
All this pain I give to you, O Lord
My scars, my pain, I give it to you, O Lord
I know my role, my job
I may not touch your robe
If I die before I wake, please let me know
So I can know

(Hook)
