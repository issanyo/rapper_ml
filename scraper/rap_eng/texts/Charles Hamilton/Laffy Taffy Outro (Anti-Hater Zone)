[Verse 1]
New Level


I went through the vents
Movin in Sewer systems
Of the Users in the sewage
Lucid is the Trip but too many
Pollute the Rhythm within
Truth with held, The music dwells
In the Fluid of the universe jail
The water knows the universe well
But through the certain perks
It doesn't do what it's work details
Cause the other dudes that be workin the scales
Can't catch up, or even get a glance at us
If he does, tell the man 'Back up'
And That's what led to my wall of defense
Never be callin it quits, Regulars fallen a bit
My head is embedded with lessons
I taught and give, when i be talkin shit
I never learn i shampoo, same cause
But no effect, i can't be brainwashed
I hold my chest, no regrets, living in my Armor
While the haters dangle from the pendulum, of Karma




[Hook]
Nighttime i try to admire the darkness
Then i see the lights
Then i feed the lights
Why Can i Not Sleeeep
Why Can i Not Bleeed
Why you think i read a story liiike





[Verse 2]
Making bets on the prodigy
Yes im a prodigy
Molested by Sodomy so Lets live inside of me
This is what you Wanted, so inchin through my ears
Listen to what a nigga hears, Fuck my little tears
Cut a niggas fears open, Shed the bleeding wax, into your peers
"Ya need a track?" "you stole that beat didn't you?" "Baby i'm pregnant"
"You dissing the team my nigga? you MUST have a death wish"
I tell em all TWO NUTS For Breakfast, My Girl been Trippin lately
I'm like "you must me pregnant" got tested now she saying
"You must respect it" saw the blue plus and i grew up in a second
Fuck ashes, the strip too dust if i mess with
If i screw up, i'm too fucked, so lets get it
And too my unborn we gonna ride
And Anyone is unalive for hurting you, Gun drawn



[Hook]
Nighttime i try to admire the darkness
Then i see the lights
Then i feed the lights
Why Can i Not Sleeeep
Why Can i Not Bleeed
Why you think i read a story liiike





[Verse 3]
Smokin Marborols backwards tryna swallow tar
So i can holler far, how can i not go hard
If i go over your head, stand the fuck up
But don't say shit, when it lands in your crust
I should be a celebrity i'm handsome enough
But i don't make songs for you to dance to and stuff
Ya hands moving up real high is dope
But i give hope to those strivin on a microphone
Nice as Hov' but twice as cold
His vice is dope my vice is flow
Whether i'm hype or so quite the pro
I known my whole life i was like this
So bite it, not my dick but the flow
I kick but it must be fly as shit
Like flies and shit, cause no one wants to bite it
My albums taking so long ain't cause no one wants to buy it
But it Breaks all the industry rules, and no one wants to bite it
Cause that's my shit, So buy it, I Stand by it
You don't like it, Today's the first day of the rest of your diet
NIGGA
