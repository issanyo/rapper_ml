[Verse 1: Charles Hamilton]
I'm fresh in pink
Like a baby that was born in a pool of Pepto, about to take your bum ass to school now lets go
All around the world making moves like gecko, Geico the psycho my music echos
Even the best know who's the best so make room for the dude with the newest fresh clothes
See Imma OD you know me I'm wildin out
One cat better than your whole team
Bonito en rosado in my Reebok sneaks
I'm sleeping with a model groupie biatch please
I drink where ever I go I'm in V.I.P
You sneak to get a bottle (let me see I.D.)
Took a glimpse at a freak
Yeah her dimples were sweet
And the prettiest teeth
And as Thick as could be
She said "Damn Charles I ain't get no dick in a week"
Unless you on your period you should be getting with me
Ya Dig!

Welll thinking hater make a way to make em say we major they just haters made the day OK just hating on the Bathing Apes, just take away the game and chain and they ashamed to say the name the games just ain't the same if they ain't got an AK to aim

Tell the bitch to exhale like Angela Bassett Bastard
