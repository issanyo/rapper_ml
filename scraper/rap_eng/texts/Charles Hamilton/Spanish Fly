The damage of Candace, from 8th grade all the way to my campus
I met another Candace. She was like my soul mate but I was so candid with another chick. She said "Can it!" The other chick,  she's like the government and I'm a bandit. I can't walk hand in hand with either Candace now.  Either Candace Brown or the Candace who was Trinidadian but looked so Spanish. My hand's width didn't match her ass but, damn, did we kiss. The aftermath is the whole world mad at her other, half and me trying to be her brother half, minus the brother. I am the L. I want to be the lover half. Fuck the past

I want you, I'll haunt because...
I want you to want me
I'll flaunt you, I'll taunt because...
I want you to want me
Alas, I'm bad, but...
I want you to want me
With me, you're bad...
Just like I'll be to you

From Candace, to Yancey, both of those names I can't see because I get blinded by the yellow. "Hi" to Yellow, another chick I would fancy to be with. But she can't stand me. I don't know why, I'm playing the game, Miss, like Sammus in Metroid. Metrosexual so let's go females who love boys, who love boys with style. I'm annoying, right? Now, that's wild. I stay away from it all, play with my balls. Ladies who say I'm out of my mind - Nah, I'm in a stall, pissing out grace. Hopefully you're loving my taste, it's like beer mixed with Cristal. 6-6-6 style, this is how we get down

So to everybody here, I'm the reason why there's even a career for anybody who is up in a Lear with tears in their eyes from the music they hear. And the music is mine, so they're doing their peers justice by not fucking with it. It's a marriage, you get upset when you get up and lifted up in that jet. But what the fuck is it that you want, success? Fine, as long as you leave me at the back of the line. I love fear. It's a smell, it's an aroma. By the way, we're in hell. And all I smell is all that, plus the Curve that I put on my fucking nerves right after the shower. I don't want to be known, I'm sick of being known. Right now, I'm being grown
