Help! I've fallen in love with 666!

I have deep conversations with the other side. I kiss the other side. I am a different guy. In love with the shit, I am. The magic, and the shit in my hand. I have a cigarette addiction. Give me a jester, so I can give him a listen. So I can cheer the fuck up. Beers are stuck up. They hear what's up, but they ain't ready to go. Because there's weed in it. I'm deep in it, reading it. I don't see no reason to be the beginning. But I am it, dammit! No pretending. My jams are standards. And that's just the beginning. This verse is amazing. Immaculate. I have to spit

I hope to amaze with the flow that I gave. Hope you know it isn't gay. The dopest flow in the situation where I don't know too much. So, I'm getting patient. Listening impatient, too. Making moves. Lady, can you do the sacred due that I do when I say voodoo is my move? I spit like a magician. I get what these faggots send. Mad disrespect. Click-clack. Hit the deck, when I have to grip the tek (tech). Blast at niggas, only to have them grinnin' in the deck when my shit is in the deck. Nigga, no disrespect. I'm just the greatest ever. Say it. Blessings

SEGA is forever, and I meant it damnit! Get a pen (pin) and cram it. Like a nigga doing damage. You gotta believe in your spit. Tolerate me when I shit. When thy spit, it's a part of my spit, too. I ain't talkin' 'bout the physical. I've inspired you, and that's what I was trying to do. Don't make me Trump and fire you. I jump the entire booth when I do my thing inside the booth, or in my ring. The ring is the bedroom. Your 3rd eye better peep it. If not, then it's not to be in secret. Hip-hop gotta believe that this deep shit is not to be kept in secret
