[Verse 1]
To everyone that listens, Listen
Inspiration given from me Sitting, Getting Visions from me drifting
Shit Couldn't be different If I missed It
This is just me living, kisses from a distance
Wind blowing I been knowing How to get open from nature
Spit omens and Poems Sober, I'm Gangsta
High off life my favorite potion Is emotion of anger
I approach life at so many Angles
An Angel, sat on my shoulder like thank you
More excepted the fact that being so gifted is a blessing
I let loose when I cry out bring your wet suit
Don't understand Is not an excuse Bless you
Everyone that knows, Goes to show lessons always come 3-fold
We know, say the ones who be enlighting minds
And blank faces from those who's simply Writing rhymes

[Hook]
Don't need no Paper, don't need no pencil
Don't need no love letter...
Cause I just want to get along with you
Don't need no beeper, Don't need no Cellular
Going Digital's better
I just want to get along with you

[Verse 2]
I find my grooves on iTunes
But whats the use of money, Currency should be fine tuned
We in a time of a recession
So why is Niggas focusing they rhymes in on there blessings, I find this shit depressing
So I will give a lesson
Robin Hood Blacked on the greedy
And in a minutes time he gave back to the needy
So while y'all getting Fat on the T.V
Cats in the Hood give me Dap when they see me
So If I put a bunch Of crap on a Cd, Its cuz yall Get the Crack though a freebie
No mixtapes These is EPs,My LPs help the Label breathe Easy
So Cop It when They drop it, Its hot product
But you dont need the Money to get the Shit that I spit
Hold that in your heart, Rock It
And turn up that iPod that's in your pocket

[Hook]
Don't need no Paper, don't need no pencil
Don't need no love letter...
Cause I just want to get along with you
Don't need no beeper, Don't need no Cellularrr
Going Digital's better
I just want to get along with you

[Verse 3]
I'm happy with the Cash that I got, but after I jotted my Hancock I was back on the block
Am I keeping It real If when after 20 mill I still reflect on life without a deal
Will, the powers that be devours me If I say I hate the shit that television sees
Or rather what television shows me
Do these shows show what I go through with my homies
Rihanna's Boots cost more than a Sophmore tuition at Rice, Must I give you a price
My niggas is nice, but get hit with the nightsticks From Police
This Is the life I live and It's Trife
Pray to To god and she kissed me goodnight, I got cash now
So when you human devils face me I don't back down
Why buy my story you could lease It like the Background
Listen a little and you get it its simple

[Hook]
Don't need no Paper, don't need no pencil
Don't need no love leter... (Yea It's Charles Hamilton)
Cause I just want to get along with you
No beeper, Don't need no Cellular (I don't do it for money I been blessed)
Going Digital's better (Thank you god)
I just want to get along with you
