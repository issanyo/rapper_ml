I could never fit in. If you're better than him you better listen. Because I'm going to break it down for you, where you've been. With the loudest music and improvement. I improve Em. Even showed Dre how to walk this way. "Awkward" stay at the top of the heart list. Target was Rhianna, but she acted retarded when she became Briana. Now, honor is pre- for me. You either already knew or I got a slew of things to show you. To show you that I'm ruth- That I'm overdosing and cool. So overdose is a fool who will bring you back to comatose-ing in school

Do you mind if I give you the honey?
I've been giving the same song
The story's been told
It's all getting old
(Tell me, where do I belong?)

One of these days I'ma chill. Until then, I'ma need me blunt and a pill. Couple of sips, couple of chicks knowing how to suck some dick. It's Karma, she's a bitch. And I'm pretty sure she has friends. This weekend we can get it in, if God ain't peeking in. If God is a woman, how could life be a bitch? It's connected forever. The problem is, I'm coming inside of the bitch that's giving me pleasure. And nine months from now, you're going to end up with something whining and loud. And I don't have the patience. So, just keep waiting

Rick Flair getting hit with a chair. Difference is the distance between my chair and me. The word "apparently." Got to keep it real. You need to feel. I really didn't need a deal. I could have moved the people but I assumed I was evil. So I joined the darkest format. No doormat, more for that. Yeah, they welcomed me in. But I was wealthy within. Then I got wealthy with Jimmy. Then I said hell to pretending. Then he showed me my illusions were the truest. And became a true friend. Therefore I doubt everything unless I see it with my 3rd eye. Forever sing...
