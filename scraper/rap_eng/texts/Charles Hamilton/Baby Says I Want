[Intro]
If I have it I give it
Only to regenerate it in a minute

[Verse 1]
Silent wars inside my pores
Vital organs trying to stay in the corpse I call me
I bleed all of what you all see
So I want a bandage that can make it all peace and peachy
Heart healing from a dark feeling
Wrap up the scars and peel the sharp thorns
Feet harboring harsh corns
But walk from door to door treating my neighborhood like an art store
I'm above par "FOUR"
Never taking my time rushin,' Dolph Lundgren in Part IV
I wanted to kill the Apollo, I did
No matter how Rocky I get I still live
As rigid as an all steel bridge
Numb inside out, I don't feel shit
All I wanted was comfort I wonder
Then I don't wonder, trust is my only blunder

[Hook]
I want I want I want I want I want it all
B-B-But baby says she want it so give it to her
Give it to her give it to her
Give it to her give it to her
I want I want I want I want I want it all
I want I want I want I want I want it all
I want I want I want I want I want it all
I want I want I want I want I want it all

[Verse 2]
She had ass, class, and a nice pad
I can smash, laugh, and write tracks
Smoke grass, crash, get right back
Feeling surreal with civilians in the building
But it was just the two of us
Lust intruded but love was true to us, super trust
Fell harder than I would ever admit too
She was better than reasons I would ever wish to commit to
She made me happy on some grown up toddler shit
So I must own up to the obvious
I want her back, I want her bad
She can walk away, I can't stomach that
Every switch of her hips is sophistication
On my lap she sits the kiss of civilization
Or is her desire my desire
Love is never sure fire but I'm only sure inside of her

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Rags to riches, Wishin' for wack rags
To differentiate themselves from glass dishes
Polishing the glass dishes barehanded
Can't reprimand it for its overbearing standards
Concern learns to earn while permanently burning
So dammit concern is damn when you turn into a germ
An A-T-O-M thinking of Adam and Eve while I'm grabbin' her weave
I want a free mind, enjoying free love
Leave sucks like a car getting keyed up
Club life admission fee: three bucks
VIP does not see us, me and me
We just stay beamed up
Watching and listening
She's in her goddess position
And I'm just washin' the dishes
Feast up

[Hook]
