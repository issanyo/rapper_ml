It's Charles Hamilton
Rock with me if you love your life
And if life is the love of your life
Ayo

(Verse 1)
Life is so good in my neck of the woods
All peace in the 'burbs, respect in the hood
And a check is what I spit and context is so good
I can text message a pencil, but leave my verse exed in the woods
Pick it up and write a verse twenty times iller
A blind wizard kinda like this guy that signed Dilla
But since not even contrast can contact where I'm at, that means it's time to black
Critics say I rap about how dope I am
Well those flows are dope, so I hope I am
Fuck that man, I know I am
Went to Hell and back, you can tell it was a fact
So I
Know I can, do anything
I feel unstoppable
A punk rocker
Not a punk, come rock with dude
Cause smoking grass out in the open with no one to cover my ass
Now I'm on the cover of another mag, I'm back

(Chorus)
Life waits for no one
She don't lie
She don't hide
She just rides
So we just ride
Life ain't a no one
She just grows
She just knows
She just shows
She just goes (2x)

(Verse 2)
I got used to being bummy
Not used to seeing money
And usually it's funny, but grooming me was something
I just proved to be nothing, funky
Really the most handsome junky
No deodorant, plus an overdose of Axe
Can leave you comatose when your nose gets so attached
No holding back, tryin' to keep your soul intact
But holy crap, this is a magnet that you're trapped in
You come across real attractive
So before any words get spoken
You get all nervous
Word, it's poking
This guy can fly
And the birds are hoping that the sky can stay open long enough to hold them
This here is called the feeling of, "Oh shit"
Nighttime is the ceiling of the ocean
This ain't life, this is the life
And being happy is another fact in it, get lost and come back in it

(Chorus)
Life waits for no one
She don't lie
She don't hide
She just rides
So we just ride
Life ain't a no one
She just grows
She just knows
She just shows
She just goes (2x)

(Verse 3)
Deep thoughts keep off the shallow
I can't be judged
I leap off the gallows
Peace talks seem lost when it's too loud
Finishing school seems minuscule now
My height is like my might so a nigga grew down, to earth
Listen to the sickest new sound
Different definitions of living can stress the living
But isn't it why we watch television? It's an exhibition
Forget it, you let it get twisted
Lesson given
Even if you didn't get it yet
I bet you dig it
Cause you can nod to it
Its that "Oh my God, I need to throw my iPod" type music
So listen to it when life becomes either too much or too little
Life becomes
Just accept it
You've been giving this life so say thank you
Find out what a minute feels like
Charles Hamilton

(Chorus)
Life waits for no one
She don't lie
She don't hide
She just rides
So we just ride
Life ain't a no one
She just grows
She just knows
She just shows
She just goes (2x)
