(intro)
Headphones up
Admit it if you like it if it rip it then I write it
If I did it then recite it (uh uh) Cause I ain’t even tryna rip it
I'm just, trying to glue it and you, you lookin stupid
I feel you yeah
Yeer!

[Verse 1]
How down do you want me to get?
What crown do you want me to fit?
What town do you want me to rip?
What couch do you want me to sit?
Damn, I’m thronin
Sitting pretty in the game I was thrown into
Every shoulder is the coldest
My career is all net like Coleman
Super Sonic if you really wanna go in
I remember Jazz sessions at Showmans
At morningside, uncle Jay said don’t enter
That’s a place for grown men
Said I’m a man and I ain’t got no friends
Then, again, they all recognize me, don’t accept my I.D
So professionally I leave, come back with a fake one
Hop on the piano tip glass with a great one

[Chorus]
I done I done I done been around the block bout 2 or 3 times
Said my name bout' 2 or 3 times
But ain't in no rush, i took my sweet...
Only so that I can find that
Everybody rockin with us, us (x4)

[Verse 2]
From a studio musician to a stage killer
One day I'll meet the producer that made thriller
As a musician, I got mad love for J.Dilla
But I’m up right, like a bass feeler
Pluck back like a guitar pick
Spit hard but I live hard, I spit what I live
Every verse is a gangsta war
What I don't say gives me canker sores
Lady luck, I wanna thank the whore
Give it all to me, until there ain’t no more
Than I slide with surefire until the heat drops
Then I chill, no temperature when ya real
Givin the illest surreal feelings to the ethereal
The beer is cold, lippin' these lyrics isn’t a miracle
Your mouth wanna dance too
So repeat after me till you can’t move

[Chorus]
I done I done I done been around the block bout 2 or 3 times
Said my name bout' 2, 3 times
But ain't in no rush, i took my sweet...
Only so that I can find that
Everybody rockin with us, us (x4)

[Bridge]
I got sick and tired of, I got sick and tired of
I got sick and tired of, I got sick and tired of
Not being listened to(x4)

[Chorus] (x2)
I done I done I done been around the block bout 2 or 3 times
Said my name bout' 2 or 3 times
But ain't in no rush, i took my sweet...
Only so that I can find that
Everybody rockin with us, us (x4)

Can you hear me? (x4)
