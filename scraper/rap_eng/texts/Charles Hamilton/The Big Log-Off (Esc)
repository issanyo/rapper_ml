(Verse 1)
Log on to see the digital domain of a n1gga with no name
You address me by my role...
Charles Hamilton!
I expect you to just know
I’m a great listener, quick to bless you with a yes but if you disrespect me and/or are stressing me then no……
The answer to youuuuu……

The answer to your question, so?
What?
Like removing the B and adding stitches to the “ut”!
Sick of living up, getting down, now I’m getting up with *N1GGAS* that live it up!
But it’s a power game
I’m sonic, I devour games!
But the powerful remain and make it a sour game by saying that it’s not our game!
I’m so PS3 the way I black but the game only respects Wii
So We
The upside down view of me
Need, to just move around loose and free!

(Hook)
Honest-sTYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY!!!
Means
I’m FREEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!!!!!
*To be the leader in adversity*
FREEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
*To speak up for the voiceless*
FREEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
*To spark change in whoever*
Means
I’m FREEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!!!!!
*To be what I am, forever!*

(Verse 2)
Enslaved by the pages of a CD booklet
It’s not that easy to be looking for credit
Especially when you weren’t there for development!
I said it to an A&R
Hence my need to be hooked in the connection between your ears, iPod, neck, and a beat!
I’m dope like a free-base high!
Ending the game, A&R’s are like CH, why?!?
When’s the last time you took a look at Anarchy???
Get ya hands off me
I’m standoffish!
In a standoff a common man talks shit
I stand on ‘em all ‘til they fall and land on they hands in a long pit of dog *SH1T*
Tell ‘em hold that crap ‘til you niggas bring that old rap back!
Old hip hop, I feel it
And old rap died when I said I liked *______* so I killed it!
On some who shot the sheriff!
But word to *______* Nu-Hop will never perish!

(Verse 3)
First thing’s first, remove Khaled from any mic, ANYWHERE!
Tell him play songs only if he really cares
About the kids going hard for no reason
Happy to be so hood, smart but you don’t see it!
Tell Flex, with all due respect
We call you the best
And all you do is stretch the first 30 seconds of a well-paid for record!
Someone calls you and requests it…
If that even happens!
Then the record is a success
The record exec then calls you with a check
Radio listeners: It’s all true, accept it
Maybe that’s why my songs always get rejected???
As if they really could blind me with some fake shit!
I got the whole city behind me on some Drake shit!!!
I’m awake and y’all sick
