I am Maxwell Smart from 'Get Smart,' and I have to rap and that's the fucked up part. I don't want to rap, I want to read. But because someone on the Faculty team is fucking up (not the other cat in The Faculty). Another savage dream: I have to call up my agent. And shit has to be a secret, so even if it's passion it has to be a dream. "Fuck you!" Mad hatred. "What are you up to?" Aou don't speak loud enough, and I probably do believe but you don't speak powerful enough. And you don't have sour in a Dutch. So you can't read between the lines I read and you're not prepared for this fucking mind in me. Mine. And by the way I'm minding me, and I'm the business

I wake up late, then stay up late then worry about this population
But when I do go to sleep I got my...
SNEAKY LITTLE SECRET AGENT!
Yeah that's right, baby, bottom line I'm...
SLEEPING WITH MY SECRET AGENT!
You can say that she's the Goddess type, but she's a
FREAKY, FREAKY SECRET AGENT!

Speak in sign language. Unfortunately, the Sign 'o the Times means it's my anguish. I've been bleeding in-between her lines and climbing the vine of the deep. And there's absolutely nothing time can tell me besides it's time to get lime and Belve'. Why does tell me, Belve' healthy, wealthy and all these other -bells for me rhyme? Because, when it's time for me to fucking radio up Agent 13, she says "None of this is working!" And I'm like, "I'm looking under your skirt-thing, and you need to start twerking." I'll cheer up, yeah. But then you'll have to start sweeping, like a witch. Then you remind me you're on some psychic shit. So now play it, gangsta. You're my secret agent

I'm melting you by being handsome. And I'm helping you by being your grandson. But you're my damn fan. We should start a jam band. And then you remind me of this damn one. And it's a '1' and Hamilton doesn't have to say a fucking thing because it lands like a ton on my back. Now that's freaking dangerous, you se-se-se-se-secret agent! Now what kind of secrets are you fading and playing, but I get played when I fade it. Not Kid n' Play but you witnessing the day when the dude with the biggest mouth has to sit and say... Absolutely nothing, you freaking gangsta witch. And I don't like how you play with this shit. So back to the freaking basics of freaking with my secret agent
