I gotta run. Can't sit still. Perhaps my hands need to chill. Touching these beats and touching these freaks. Man, damn. Am I chillin' yet? Because I got silk in my linen, and... yes. I can bet it came from some lady that I can sex. And she's my gf. Mind your business while I get busy to this track. "Ayo Ness! You said you was comin' from Philly right?! CHEESE STAKE! Well that's how I'm feeling right! IN EACH STATE! And I ain't even dissin' you, dawg. But I'm a witness. Benchpress(,) niggas get off..." And that's just as sick as it gets, dawg. 'Cause this is some ridiculous shit, y'all. My nigga I don't fit in the game. Therefore, I just play kick ball with my niggas, y'all

I'm in love
And I'll throw it all away because
In love
You gotta throw it all away
Because in love
If you don't throw it all away
You will become
A part of my Islamic Voodoo
Challa!

I gotta run. I set myself up. So, I gotta help myself up. No hands reaching down. They('re) all pointing up. Pulling me down. Pulling me around. Look at my crown. It's on the head of another. Getting head from a mother. But that don't make me feel the same as being in bed with a rubber. Making love to a lady you've never seen unless you opened up a Vasoline. Just to a magazine. Like she was on the cover. But once again. We had no rubber. The chick I made love to put a curse on me! And it worked so perfectly! And it hurts to be in certain scenes where girls wanna flirt with me. Uncertainty. So much doubt in my mind. But what comes out of my mouth is (every time) on the line

I gotta run. I can't sit still. My hands can't chill. So, I do a hand stand. Still, niggas think I'm cool. Off the wall. That's where I went. Then on the floor (flaw) is where my feet went. With a splat. Stapped on the... head of a nigga who tried to get back. Stapped on. Stepped on. Back on the weapon. Freakin' bitches, but never with a strap-on. But there's voodoo in my life, and it's killing me! Because I feel like the shit is billing me! 20,000 seconds of your life, multiplied by ~seconds~ of your life... then multiplied by the second of the night where you laid eyes on me. Finally, I can see I've been blinded between the lines of being I (eye) and ~me~
