No one is around me while i flow. Hoping that the flow is as dope as those that clown me. Those are not around me right now, so the sound is deep. 8-bit nigga, the greatest spitting
And the river called the Nile smitten. My style is dripping cause I've been swimming inside of it, privately spitting. Keeping it all in and drowning me as long is the beat is loud.

They're all against me or wishing to be with me, so I'ma keep spitting

It's not Star Wars but I got hot bars for all those that try to stay in the hard part of the lane, which is the Hov lane. And I go with his brain, kidnap it too, use force and then give him back his attitude. Shit. I dissed Drake and Hov. I gotta be the greatest, you know
