[Verse 1]
I don't write i masturbate on a track
So my kids can get inspired
Why you hating on that?
It's whatever
My shits hot me
And real heads say I'm what hip-hop should be
A lot of vets been coming off of the top lately
Is it hot? Maybe, but i can drop 80
Hours, worth of straight, powerful verses
Off this great mind that I allow to be heard when
I sit down, and write down whats going on right now with my lifestyle
Gray shades of memory are all white now
Blaze days and Hennessy feel alright now
I must be something super
Even in a drunken stupor
The one polluter in my constant state
Of happiness, is the constant hate
From snakes, when they all in my face, but wait
I chose to Jake the Snake
I wrestle with the fake

[Hook]
And that's how I'm feeling today
No need to be coming out
Cuz my mind is stealing the day
Everything else ill never know about
I like it alone
Maybe I like it alone
Maybe I like it alone
Maybe I like it
I like it alone
Maybe I like it alone
Maybe I like It alone
Maybe I like it

[Verse 2]
My imagination gets the best of me
Sip the rest of my drink
Hit the spliff and drift
So I can cook up a different recipe
I take lift, then I sit upset at these pissed off Christians
Bitchin' cuz I said God is a woman
Stop with the bullshit, she spoke to me and i believe it
I felt a lot better when I first read The Secret
It's a pretty good book, you should read it
I hope the author isn't pissed you know that i leaked it
Summer gave me the book and told me to keep it
Did i say too much?
Is this the deep end?
We then
Gotta rewrite the game
There are no secrets if we like the change
Since we changed the whole system of democracy
Why y'all afraid to even listen to my honesty?

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
I don't know why
Y'all don't get the whole shit
I bring to you folks
Some think that I don't spit
I just flow with the no lisp
Cuz some critics act as if they don't hear shit and i don't know shit
Like i ain't grow with, pain and emotion
Like i ain't just like you, but i was born in the river floatin
Different strokes for different folks, but do you even listen when a nigga's flowin?
Did i get you open? I'm hoping don't know if.. don't know when
I just go in…
So i guess that i just know knowing..
Life in the fast lane
Look at the world in slow motion…
It's Charles Hamilton
