[Verse 1]
It’s too much to even try to explain
Your vibe is unstrained and times haven't changed
But time in arranged makes me feel like my mind is deranged
Your eyes are amazing
I see sanity it em’, do I sound nuts?
If so, let me start over from the ground up
Let’s act like no one is around us
We’re lucky to be lost like Vegas just found us
I don’t know if I’m reading the signs wrong
But I believe in what eyes can do if the vibe is strong
Reality bites like a python
And my heart is on the sleeve that I write on
I write with my right, so I hope you don’t think this is just a nice song
You might be wrong
I just wanna be your personal magician
Before the night is gone and it’s worthless to mention this sentence

[Hook]
Lets make a little magic, baby
(Do you believe in that?)
Here’s a piece of my heart
(If you want it you can have it baby, I don’t need it back)
(Why?)
Cause I’m spending time with…
(My imaginary girlfriend)
Living life with…
(My imaginary girlfriend)
Getting high with…
(My imaginary girlfriend)
Just kissing my lips…
(My imaginary girlfriend)

[Verse 2]
Chances are I’m jumpin’ the gun
I guess I’m predicting for somethin’ to come (Heh)
In my world your number is one
In your world my number is none
Cause you don’t know me yet
I’ve been watchin’, jottin’ notes on how I could approach
Don’t stop me though
From a distance, we locked eyes
I cannot lie; I got blind from the way your spotlight shines
Maybe then was not the right time
I don’t care; I went home to jot some tight lines
If we kiss, we rob the sky blind
Cause the stars wanna watch us, alright fine
I pour you a glass of wine, while I roll up a dime
I don’t know if you smoke, but I know that you fly
High, like you totin’ a lime, that’s green
I know that didn’t go over your mind

[Hook]
Lets make a little magic, baby

(If you want it you can have it baby, I don’t need it back)

Getting high with…
(My imaginary girlfriend)
Just kissing my lips…
(My imaginary girlfriend)

[Verse 3]
If you gave me your number
I won’t be so wild annoying and call ya
We would talk for a while, enjoying all the
Perks, we get from work
I oughta, confess
I’m intimidated cause you’re taller
But I want you in my company
And maybe it’s your height that humbles me
And maybe one night, sittin’ underneath the sunbeams
You will see that you should come with me
What the hell gon’ come between Y-O-U-A-N-D-M-E
I know you make believe in dreams
That someone could make you feel less empty
I ain’t a angel, but god sent me, to show you love constantly
Get me? Its magic, no tricks up my sleeve
But this is just a thought, let’s kiss in my dreams
Good night!
