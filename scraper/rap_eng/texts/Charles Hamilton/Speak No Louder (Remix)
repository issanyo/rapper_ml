Haha
I know what's missing
Hahaha
I'm smiling!
Yo

[Verse 1]
Every time I get the feeling in me
I'm a monster, niggas think i got the thriller in me
I'm a monster, niggas think i got Dilla in me, pause
I hear the hate, see the anger, feel the envy
Don't make me no never-mind, cause I'm feeling spiffy
You don't like me? Then why the fuck you dealing with me?
I got poets, gangstas, and dealers with me
I got a chip on my shoulder, but yet I'm feeling friendly
I am who I am, y'all niggas still pretending
So everything you've come to know to be real has ended
You're hardheaded. This beat is hard as your head, which is funny cause you're softer than Dharma and Greg
You're the type to act hard, then go talk to the feds
Well if karma does exist, based on karma, you're dead
Uh, Charles Hamilton: of course I'm the bomb
You think I'm invading your space? Then report it to Tom. what's wrong?

[Chorus]
People always wanna see all the place that I be
Can't bring em, so I put it in a song
People got their own opinion about the things I mention every time I put it in a song
Haters wonder why we couldn't get along
And then they get an answer when I put it in a song
So speak no louder, than a song and they'll be talking all day, talking all day long, come on

[Verse 2]
They say I got a big mouth
Nah I got a big soul, big heart
Do it for the love not to get dough
So when you see me going hard in a cypher
I make it so that it ain't ever hard to decipher
My heart is my rifle, I'm firing from it
So when you see the smoke that means that the fire is coming
Rub, together two sticks, still ain't gonna do shit
The kid from Apollo leave you Rocky like a cruise ship
Who's this New prick, being such a nuisance? fluent, loose lips, genius with the music, too sick, flu sick needle in the roof shit, you sick prove it, beat him with a broom stick to prove which one is the future of the shit
And I don't pop a hammer so I'm too legit to quit
So speak no louder, than a song and they'll be talking all day, talking all day long, come on

[Chorus]
People always wanna see all the place that I be
Can't bring em, so I put it in a song(It's that roller coaster music baby!)
People got their own opinion about the things I mention every time I put it in a song
Haters wonder why we couldn't get along
And then they get an answer when I put it in a song
So speak no louder, than a song and they'll be talking all day, talking all day long, come on

[Verse 3]
I got a lot of pressure on my shoulders, I never let it get the best of me never will I fold up
Ever rest for a second forever breath is what I'm blowing
You spend your life repairing what seven seconds I just go in
Reckless as I ever been
Breakfast is my medicine
Medicine Excedrin the Excedrin is treble and bass cleft
Hate? Yes, they kept greatness hostage, I escape from the bondage make threads so-
You wanna know, I'm sort of cold, but so hot
You'll never know when I might go for broke
The way I roll is so alone, you know not
If I'll explode, but I got it under control
There's no point in trying to hide
All the skeletons that surround you
So speak no louder, than a song and they'll be talking all day, talking all day long, come on

[Chorus]
People always wanna see all the place that I be
Can't bring em, so I put it in a song
People got their own opinion about the things I mention every time I put it in a song
Haters wonder why we couldn't get along
And then they get an answer when I put it in a song
So speak no louder, than a song and they'll be talking all day, talking all day long, come on
