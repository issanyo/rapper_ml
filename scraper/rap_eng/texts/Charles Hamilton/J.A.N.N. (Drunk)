Ain't nobody looking around they all trancing, dancing, I'm the biggest thing since (HANSEN). On the microphone do my namesake, Manson. They hate chances because they take chances. UFO
Sitting beautiful like I want it to. Judo flow giving viewing globes to the comfortable. Chewing every tracks like my arm hit an edible needle. Edible veins forever can change

The beat so dope (dope), the flow so dope (dope)
I'm colder than Christmas and everybody know (woo)
The beat so dope (dope), the flow so dope (dope)
I'm colder than Christmas and everybody know (woo), and everybody know

Just another drunk night, just another drunk night, just another drunk night

I'm just standing there watching you move, just move
