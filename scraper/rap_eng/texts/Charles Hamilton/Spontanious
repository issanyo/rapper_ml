Been on some new shit
Nigga said Scenario
Scenario H



Esoteric, better prepared for me being a better lecturer than Eric
And I ain't talking Jerome Dikey or even Michael Dyson
Behind the mic I get quite exciting
But the white in side the lining of my nose
Is tellin me that my pose should be a felony
So imma get more dough
Then what was just tellin me my pose is a felony
All my bros, pardon me but yo
Are like pro's and they like Spelling bees
Because I dont know what they throwin at me verbally
But Imma break it down just to let em' see

And I ain't playin'...
Its not time square but you can find me right here under the lights glare






Hands in the Air
(Spinning around, Spinning around)
Hands in the Air
(Waving around Waving around)
As we both float...to whats playing
Hands in the Air
(Spinning around, Spinning around, Waving around)





As the Saxophone hisses
I get mad at the chrome glitches
No one has a Gat so I guess my blown
...Fuck
Pardon me my high just got blown
I guess my blown cap dont matter to you old niggas talkin' bout your old riches
I got a Dough sickness
So sick when I see the dough
Because I get the dough
Spend the dough
On shit that leaves me so sick
No open windows
Alt F4 or Control click
But I'm too High to even focus
On the screen sippin' lean or Four Loko
Counting these four Locust
Four times four is Sixteen
Now what the fuck is this
Yall worried about whether I  wrote this
Worry about my nose, as It itches, itches






Hands in the Air
(Spinning around, Spinning around)
Hands in the Air
(Waving around Waving around)
As we both float...to whats playing

Hands in the Air
(Spinning around, Spinning around, Waving around)






Cuddle with a teddy bear
Teddy bear got white in it so I'll never care
Sniffing my Teddy Bear
Nothing purer than a white in it
So for Five minutes I'm high off the childhood as if i spend it
Five minutes, Five dollars My business
Paying attention to my children
Their Smiles are my millions
So I'm getting high Off of their youth
No Jackson No actin'
Not even Bo Jackson
I dont make shit for yall to be appealing with
I make shit you get high and hit the ceiling with
And Some how...Some way...Like Jay
You all listen to me and get a feeling from it
Now y'all niggas is stealing from it
Cuz I get high off a what you feel getting numb

And I'm getting, high feeling numb

And I ain't Felling none

How you gone say you ain't feeling some

I ain't feeling some, but I feel the drums

Coke Whore habbis Nigga

Yaw'll feel me one day
