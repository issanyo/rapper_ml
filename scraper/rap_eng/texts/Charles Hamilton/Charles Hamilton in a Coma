I'm letting go of all my fear and inhibitions. Just to stand here and get to spitting. Niggas act like they don't hear it. Well, do they listen? It bothers me a little bit so I get Al Jazeera then I enter them with the vibe of the song. The soul that'll have them dying for long. I love making music, I swear I do. This is Theraflu. All I do is stare at you through your third eye. Yeah I'm looking right back at you with a bad attitude. And I rap mad facts while these cats act rude. But they can't rap for shit, they have mad glue. It's like their tongue is stuck on something dumb. And all I do is run what I run. If you want to come. motherfucker, come. Swing away, but I'm a genius, okay. So I ain't swinging today

The hood got a nigga too scared to shine. So if you don't mind, I'ma stand here and shine. I don't leave the house unless I look bummy. Basically means I'm looking for money, and I'm hungry. So if I'm panhandling. Damn, Hamilton can handle it. I'm just taking mad change and channeling. Whoa. So I step back. Add another set-back. Add another set-back? I slap the fucking set-back. I'm never stopping. NEVER. And that basically means I've gotten better. And when I mean it, I see it and I believe it. Why would you not believe it? You're a non-believer and non-believers get tossed in a pot of stew

Twist of the lid to the drink. Yeah, I get biz when I think. I'm not in the biz but I'm watching this shit as I think: "These niggas are shit to me." I'm pissed off because they making history but I do this shit every day. Give some shit to me! Mad change, mad cash, mad love. Bad aim for bad cats with wack gloves. These niggas can't fire at me. I'm not dying you see, while I rhyme on the beat. Charles Hamilton with Kid Dynamo. That's the name of the sample but, I don't know. So I come with my information. Gather it up. Start rapping my stuff and then y'all had enough. I just hoped you enjoyed it. Because to me it's poison you've been enjoying. My poison, to kill me. My choices, to kill me. But I'm that boy, you feel me?
