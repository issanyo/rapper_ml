[Intro]
Always in love and shit
With the same chick
That's where niggas get it wrong

[Verse 1]
Yo, dear Miss Lady
I've been thinking of you lately
Hoping you hold and date me
But you warped and erased me
I'll be a good fella, hell of a Scorsese's
I say we may be the future J.B
And I don't mean Bieber, but you are my baby
Just lay and be praised Queen B
Let me lay in between
Your smooth and beautiful thighs
No, using you to get by
You the apple of my eye
From the front or behind
All three align so I ain't finding
Lies in disguise, just finding us lying
An eye in the sky is looking quite fire
Like the fourth of July, and after it's inspired us
I'mma just have you hitting notes higher than the choir does
Nobody to quiet us
I know it's a different side and such
But I think I've been silent for quite enough

[Hook]
Baby girl I think you're fine
I think about you all the time
I just need a place to find
Where we can be just you and I
You're always on my mind
I'm always wishing you were mine
I just need a place to find
Where we can be just you and I

[Verse 2]
(Bishy!)
Honestly I just be trying to build
Not hold you by your will
But you know that I will
Nah, I'm just kidding
No weapon conceal(ed)
I just want you to feel
Why I kneel to your appeal
One of the finest, and I'm finding you real
So it's a seal deal
The sticker won't peel
Bananas is just slander for my candour
No incubus, but I plan to make you my hot dancer
And you're gonna be
Don't you make fun of me
You know dancehalls weren't my public scene
Probably because I couldn't hit it to the beat
So unfortunately, I'd leave in defeat
I look at it now like you were trying to teach
Don't know if it's a reach, or a referee-ing week
I wish I would've let it be
And not let pessimism get to me
Then maybe we'd be living differently

[Hook]
Baby girl I think you're fine
(And you would be with me)
I think about you all the time
(For all eternity)
I just need a place to find
Where we can be just you and I
(And you would be the queen)
You're always on my mind
(I would be your king)
I'm always wishing you were mine
I just need a place to find
Where we can be just you and I

[Bridge]
Just you and I
Just you and I
I just need a place to find where we can be just you and I
You're always on my mind
I want you all the time
You and I
You and I

[Hook]
Baby girl I think you'll find
I think about you all the time
I just need a place to find
Where we can be just you and I
You're always on my mind
I'm always wishing you were mine
I just need a place to find
Where we can be just you and I
