Been inside of darkness, enlightening the harps of the sky
“Ten times my darts” is her reply
Send time, I do not occupy His time
If my reply was right then it’s time to kiss divine on the lips and live fine
Resembling psycho while visiting prime
Prime Minister rhyme, I’m sick in the mind with my sentences
Line spitter, dime niggas to lies, wise nigga to guys, Wise Guy to night
Hiding behind, the cross is near
Flossing while swallowing beer
Hopped on a bear and told her cub to come here
Told the world to compare the rarity here
Dare me to cheer I’ll bury a bear in my cubby, hurry
Dare you to love me. Get married in a hurry. You give a married man worry
And you’re destiny’s step-niece
Let me get a piece of the steps, chisel away
Chipping for days. Whip it away. Kissing your face
Remember the grave, always there
But sometimes I wonder if always cares

When it’s time to say goodbye
What will you be doing? What will you be doing?
How graphic to listen to the tragic
How graphic to listen to the tragic
How graphic to listen to the tragic
Listen to the magic
