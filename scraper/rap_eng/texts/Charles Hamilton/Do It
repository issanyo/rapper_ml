[Verse 1]
I met her mid-summer, me and my man Howard
I was sweatin' bullets and needed a damn shower
She didn't know my name
Didn't know a thing, about me
Like her brain had Novocaine
Which was cool cause I had a clean slate
I did a lot of dirt in my day, for Pete's sake
She, told me her name and I said
It's nice to make your acquaintance
Then I made the most brazen of statements
Jokes about her name, pretty face and some great hips
Surprisingly it worked, we had a great conversation
I said let's keep in touch and make our way into dating
She said she don't date kids
But Charles ain't a kid!
And if so, why did things go as far as they did?
She blushed, I gave her arm a kiss, she pulled back
What's wrong with the harmless kiss
From the lips of a Harlem kid
She said she got a man... Damn

[Hook]
Leave it to me girl, I'll make it right
Change your life, make it bright, face the light
Trust and believe girl I ain't the type
To make a move, break the rules
Just to lose
Now usually I wouldn't do this do this
But we gotta face the music, music
So anything you want, and anything you need
I'll do them for you

[Verse 2]
You got a man huh? That's bad to know
But do you wanna go? She said I have to go
I was tight but I was cool
I said tell me about him
She paused and said he's an Average Joe
I said, that's so comical, but then again that's so honest so
Can you tell me if he pleases you?
Cause you know you got an ass so astronomical
But, besides sex what else can he not do?
She said must you be cocky?
I said I try not to
She laughed, she tried to change the subject
But she was too deep in the strange seduction
I said, I know you have thoughts of me
She said "How?"
Well, your bra is pink
I can tell by that glance in her eye
That she might wanna give that other man shit a try so...

[Hook]
Leave it to me girl, I'll make it right
Change your life, make it bright, face the light
Trust and believe girl I ain't the type
To make a move, break the rules
Just to lose
Now usually I wouldn't do this do this
But we gotta face the music, music
So anything you want, and anything you need
I'll do them for you

[Verse 3]
As the summer died and I got her number I
Wondered why I shouldn't give this shit another try
But she really fell in love with the guy
Couldn't get enough of the guy, shit I was fuckin' surprised
He didn't seem to know how to treat her
I'm the sugar honey ice tea, ain't shit sweeter
I'm not a loser don't wanna lose her I wanna keep her
But dammit I'mma keeper, and so I had to leave her, alone
But somethin' keeps pullin' me back, me back
But what's killin' me in the fact she's happy that
Cat is lucky, but trust me, it ain't permanent
This is wheel of fortune
And I'm waitin' for my turn again
There's always gonna be room in my heart for
You till' the day you two drift apart
And you let me in so deep that you can scream
But goodnight for now
I'mma see you in my dreams

[Hook]
Leave it to me girl, I'll make it right
Change your life, make it bright, face the light
Trust and believe girl I ain't the type
To make a move, break the rules
Just to lose
Now usually I wouldn't do this do this
But we gotta face the music, music
So anything you want, and anything you need
I'll do them for you

[Outro]
Baby, I wanna do
All of the things your man won't do
(I'll do them for you)
Baby, I wanna do
All of the things your man won't do
(I'll do them for you)
Baby, I wanna do
All of the things your man won't do
(I'll do them for you)
Baby, I wanna do
All of the things your man won't do
(I'll do them for you)
Baby, I wanna do
All of the things your man won't do
(I'll do them for you)
