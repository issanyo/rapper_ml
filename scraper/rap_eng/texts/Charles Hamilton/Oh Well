[Intro]
George, you copy
Yeah what you got
I think I see something man, I don't know what it is
Alright hang on, making my way over
Hurry
Copy that
Alright help me with this wreckage here
You seeing what I'm seeing?
What is that?
I don't know, it's what I think it is
Oh my god
That's it
That's it
That's gotta be it
We got it. Harlem we're coming home. Harlem we have recovered the black box

Slow down, ease into it
For the record, it's Charles Hamilton
Thanks Eminem, this for you

[Verse 1]
They say I can't rap about being dark no more, they never say I can't rap 'bout being Charles no more
Getting doped up in Baltimore, eating every rapper til they are no more
My story is glorious. Notoriously, a gory kid
Still ain't got no shorty in the crib
Report to me Big
The afterlife's spokesperson
My flow works I'm so certain
But I'm a perfectionist with my wizardry
I expect to get a wet kiss from history
I just can't represent it, shizzit
I guess I'll be depressed for a minute
Sipping on a mystic, going ballistic
I am no bitch on some Madonna chauvinist pig shit
Hold it while you listen, your joy is my pain
Medicate me, your boy is insane, poisonous rain

[Hook]
Ah fuck it oh well, everything's crossing over
Ah fuck it oh well, everything's crossing over
Ah fuck it oh well, everything's crossing over
Ah fuck it oh well, ah fuck it oh well

[Verse 2]
Boo you whore!
You hear those beautiful chords?
That's the Devil making me do his chores
This beat was made without using force, technically
So I expect to view some snores
The fire in hell I use for chewing smores (you kidding me?)
My teeth are rotting out so I don't do it any more
My metaphors are metaphysical
A better lyrical exhibition is  to go into Heaven and slit a throat
So I dissed Pac, crucified by hip-hop
Suicidal kids knock it, you provide the flip flops
To use when I decide to kick rocks at the rhythm
Pick it up, I got you
I am not kidding
Hotter than Virginia when it's vacation time
Making satanist rhymes, making me fine
But hey I don't mind
I say what's on my mind and get censured
But I swallowed it and get injured
So I sip Ensure

[Hook]
Ah fuck it oh well, everything's crossing over (insecure)
Ah fuck it oh well, everything's crossing over
Ah fuck it oh well, everything's crossing over
Ah fuck it oh well, ah fuck it oh well

[Verse 3]
Momma pray for me
God thinks I'm ugly
Stop with the touching me!
Goth kids trust me
I can't let them down, I gotta carve
Watching me heal is the hottest part
In the sky see a lot of dark
I'm just a hermit with a modest heart
Some days require Tylenol
Women hate me like a twat fart
And these niggas ate me like a pop tart
My label wants to make me a pop star
I had a hot start, y'all wanted music and I dropped art
Until I pass off influence to killing off classes and apologize with the realest of passion
I am a tyrant but still I am passive, I'm using this deal just to reel me a bad bitch
Sit on my lap while she pictures me rapping
She's too bad nigga give me a napkin

[Hook]
Ah fuck it oh well, everything's crossing over
Ah fuck it oh well, everything's crossing over (I just wanna make some things clear)
Ah fuck it oh well, everything's crossing over ( I do believe in the cult, but I grew up Christian)
Ah fuck it oh well

[Outro]
Oh God if you exist I need you to forgive me for the way I feel
I you need you to forgive me
For abandoning those that really love me
God I repent to you all the time
The only thing that seems to respond is the dark side
But I gotta keep a tight lip
Just ride out with the...

I want you motherfuckers to hear this piano
All my musicians out there
Don't let em take your magic
