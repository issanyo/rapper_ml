[Verse 1]
You probably listened to my first joint like what's wrong with me
I already told you, I make songs for me
Some of y'all probably thought the songs are weak
The rest of y'all think that you can get along with me
See a lot of shit changed since I admitted I'm a ho
I got with Tiffany in case you bitches wanna know
So if you have one wish like a Ray J song
Like a reggae song, I just kill 'em with the no
Oh, everybody knows I'm a probably lyrically
So these lame little niggas wanna get at me
Skip to me, I stand like an Eiffel Tower
In the lab you can't stifle our creativity
Ours via me, Black, Mars, and Jerry
I'm a beat making beast, man it's hard to scare me
Yeah, sorry Mars but this time around
I made all the beats and spit rhymes and rounds
See, some say I talk a lot about myself
It's true because I never got a lot of help, see
Mama raised me, papa played me
Harlem made me, grandma and uncle trained me
God set my path and he never betrayed me
When I got lazy, the devil tried to slay me
Listened to rock and pop from the 80's
Pac and Shady, Nas and Jay-Z
A lot of things on my chest that really hurt
So I gotta get it off and express it in a verse
Tell the story as to why Rebecca's in the dirt
To the messages in church, to the lesson that I've learned
And whether you cats know, I can be an asshole
Lot of people want my head up on a perch
But (but) but whatever it is worth
Music is in my blood, I'll forever put in work

[Hook]
And it won't stop till I'm deaded in a hearse
I guarantee this album gon' be better than the first
And it won't stop till I'm deaded in a hearse
I guarantee this album gon' be better than the first
And it, and it won't stop till I'm deaded in a hearse
I guarantee this album gon' be better than the first
And it won't stop till I'm deaded in a hearse
I guarantee this album gon' be better than the first
That's why I got you saying....

[Outro]
Oh oh, and in case you wanted to know
Sober Karaoke is when you consciously bear your soul
So fasten your seat belt, we're gonna go for a ride
It's a musical ride
It's not an album, it's an experience
So just vibe with me for the next album
Oiste, ya heard me?

(Repeats:
Looking at me saying daddy hold me
You just want that Sober Karaoke)

And I won't give up
This hip-hop is such a big part of the way that I get down
