(Verse 1)
The sensitivity of Nations involved with temptations..
How can I be a sensation
Without falling like leaves
In Autumn?
Of course I believe
But what's next to believe in?
The fact I'm breathing in
Cats are asking for me to weaken...
Well, I can't do it
I don't sing songs while dreaming
....
Damn..
Over heads I go and then I lift you from your toes
And if you're listening then I figure you would know
Niggas wouldn't get it 'til I sit in a UFO,
And get dome from a chick, wishing she was golden
So I put a spell on the very movement
Pardon me, moment
I'm sorry if I'm talking all this Moo shit, ladies
But I know what it means to you..
So basically I dream of you...
While I sit and listen to a J beat
(Uhn, Uhn)
J-D beat or two..
Sorry but, I be abusing beats
And I mean to be as gentle as diligence when I spit sentences!
But I'm spilling shit as if I fell from the wayside from temptation
This is not Bayside but I meant to stay in the basement
Working on experiments and there it is again..
I wish to be a scientist
Maybe my music is my science..
And on some Psy shit, I guess I get it in
But there could be an argument between the white of my eyes and them
Those who wish to understand the future as I give it
And I live it, cause I'm in it...
UHN!

(Hook)
Sooooo it's okay to be myself
(I found out the hard way!)
Sooooo it's okay to be myself
(I'm living life the CHarles way!)
Sooooo it's okay to be myself
Forever and a day!
(One more!)
Sooooo it's okay to be myself
Forever and a day!

(Verse 2)
My common goal was just to rap to this beat
So as I stand, clapping as me..
And I don't mean having a free clapper for me
I mean applauding cause I actually D-I-D
What I wanted to do
But No I.D. is Dilla and I'll be 'Ye
And it'll be the proudest day when we can make..
Another Big Brother
And he'll be Toomp, get it??
A sonic joke and then the truth is spitten, in the booth
And I will go praise in the name of sound
Cause I don't know what I'd be doing without 'em
I'll be blue without 'em and he'll be blue regardless
So don't doubt 'em!
OH, the music I'm sprouting
Kinda like a...
......
It was gonna be a STD joke
But that'll leave me with little hope
To get a chick who can give a little bit of WHOA!
My misogyny comes from growing up in the HO..
O-D, oh..
Since life's a bitch, I guess me being in her
Means me moving slowly...
I'm from the 'burbs, probably a farm
But..
I am the Sun so probably it's hard to be a rock
It's funny how the Sun is a gas and..
Everybody's under the fact
If you gas the Sun you can get more fire than premium
In a car when it crashes!
A lyrical orgasm as I spit gashes!
Nothing but slashes
After my sentences, periods added
If you don't want to add it then it's just traumatic
.....
Musically this is a marriage!
UHN!.....
UHN!
WHOA!
WHOA!
......
......
UHN! I'mma keep going too
I don't even think justice is done!

(Hook)
Sooooo it's okay to be myself
(I found out the hard way!)
Sooooo it's okay to be myself
(I'm living life the CHarles way!)
Sooooo it's okay to be myself
Forever and a day!
(One more!)
Sooooo it's okay to be myself
Forever and a day!

(Verse 3)
I'm proud to be myself like I was starring in the Fighing Temptations!
I don't write shit and writings a temptation!
But I believe in myself finally so why is niggas hating??
I finally had a bout of vibration with my Sensei!
And as he would say, admit..
It makes sense for you to not be the way you've been
Since the age of 10, minus 10..
My mind's a 10
A diamond then
But if you minus the tin of which I am in
I am in the vibration
Of wanting to be the kind of guy I'd wish to be..
..And that's the vibe I'm in
Silent sentences, I don't need to speak 'em
Yo, I'm going for peace so I don't care what be happening
When my eyes close for the evening
If I sound like Biggie than it's a biggie of a soundbite
Cause I ain't really tryna sound like no one really...
Shit..
I go to sleep and dream about rolling lilies...
White girls laughing
In this white man's world
I'm simply another black man asking
To be a white man!
A black fantasm
We all wanna stand in suits, be fantastic!
I'm a gentleman, that don't mean I'm soft
I'm just soft with my hands and my point gets across!
....And my point gets a cross like I'm praying to God
Praying to saints, pray to Allah
Pray to the Day!
Buddhism is safe to say
For me
The way to be and the way to go
So Siddhartha, may I be the author
Of what people tryna find when they start up
The wondering about how to go with they day to day
My flow is my day to day
So I hope my flow isn't the focus of you day to day
I hope my substance is, I'm in love with it
Like it's an addiction to some other shit
As banned by the government!
And even with Apple on my back
The temptation of the apple 'caused all this shit to be some other shit!
So I perhaps like to eat grass
So I roll up in my mind, psychically eat some grass
You never been this high!
I eat the grass seeds like Aubrey
So I say Hi to this guy and I ship 'em with grands
This is just a gentleman wishing with his hands
That he can meet the man who made the gentle man
..And if I even try to remember it then my life is November 10th
11/10, start the countdown
My birthday basically means what I'm 'bout now is..
Finding a bounce and not calling it a bounce....
Giving it tips. Each one of my sentences is..
Reason why ladies should be giving a fit
And then giving a fist
Black Power!
Then I roll up black sour and laugh for hours
The sour is black, pardon me, it's green
But the sour, in fact, starts the deepest dreams!
Niggas don't understand the components
So every woman and man's an opponent!
UHN!
See that's marijuana, heroin, cocaine
And the honor of a dealer
Putting in roach spray
And if it sounds dope, Hey..
My entire catalog is sour
Mixed with alcohol taking away the pain of today!
And the today is the tomorrow when looking down the halls
Of what you had to go through
To have the vocals to rap on Pro Tools
My facts you know are cool!
And as a matter of fact, with no boo
Meaning a ghost
I stay noble to my boo who knows she is no boo!
WHOA!
That means a quote
That means my ghosts are trapping her
Into the dreams of the most.. HIGH
And I am the Sun
So please don't make my T-E-M-P
T-A, T-I-O (laughs)
Yo, ONE!
And I spell it out so yo, I'm done!
It's not a spell though
It's simply me being a Macho Man with bandages on my elbow..
Can't wait until I go the Hell home
Call up on my cellphone
Meaning my mind cause my mind's in a cell, yo
Whoever could understand this mind
Shit, I ain't sell no-thing..
So I hope people are noting the fact I'm so true
And these old dreams have come true!
Thank You Dilla for making the beat
And thank you Charles Hamilton for having the vocals!
This is what happens when you're hopeful
Not imaging being hopeful..
-Charles Hamilton
