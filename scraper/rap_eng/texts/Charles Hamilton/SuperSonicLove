[Intro]
You ever looked in somebody's eyes and...
Within five minutes, you knew you were in love?
You wasn't crazy...
Fell in Super Sonic Love, heh
Maybe I'm crazy

[Verse 1]
Whenever she walks in the room
Your senses tingle, her walk is the moon
You see stars when she's talking to you
She makes your eyes water with the softest perfume
I was at the bar lost in the blues
Drowning in sorrow, i need it all for the cruise
She had a glass of pink Vodka
She was drunk, but could still speak proper
I sat there, amazed at her grace
She's the perfect ending, to a day gone to waste
Night dreaming of me laying by her waist
She looked so good i'd pay for a taste
It ain't somethin i'd say to her face
Till she glided to my table, haze in a daze
She said you a good boy, i know gonna act up

[Hook]
Now if you’re looking for fastlove
If that's love in your eyes
It's more than enough
Had some bad luck
So fastlove is all that
I've got on my mind

[Verse 2]
Stood up like a Torpedo
She officially brought out the Scorpio
No drama like the Maury Show
Just on an intergalactic tour we go
We can start on Earth, to make our way to Mars
Hcho let me in a car, that could graze the stars
Just, close your eyes and imagine the travel
Imagination's only half of the battle
Her scent was intoxicating me
I said, "You know how hot you making me"
She said "Don't you know I can make you scream
I'm a goddess, this is not your make-believe"
Every thought that you think about
Is what i tell you to think, don't try to figure it out
She was all that i needed
And I'm almost time loving...
(Get's over powered by the chorus)

[Hook]
Now if you’re looking for fastlove
If that's love in your eyes
It's more than enough
Had some bad luck
So fastlove is all that
I've got on my mind

[Verse 3]
I got her open and high, from floating on lye
Hoping that i, can show her how to focus on mind
The way i do, i tried to so many times
She deny'd it, tried it, now she's coasting a lot
This is real, believe cause you won't be alive
In the morning, i can see through both of your eyes
Too much for you? I hope not
Cause it can get deeper, then i won't stop
All of this for just letting me into your heart
It's funny, cause I'm waiting for the beginning to start
It's a happy ending so far, and we can make it better
Down to Earth love making leave you deep in space forever
Cause Baby! I ain't Mr.Right...

[Hook]
Now if you’re looking for fastlove
If that's love in your eyes
It's more than enough
Had some bad luck
So fastlove is all that
I've got on my mind
