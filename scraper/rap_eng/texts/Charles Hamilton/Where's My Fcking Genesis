[Intro]
Ahhh shit ughh alright, am I going to take my morning piss or go with my insatiable need to play Sonic the Hedgehog this morning?

It's Charles Hamilton
It's Charles Hamilton
It's Charles Hamilton

[Verse 1]
Boredom is a killer
I'm at deaths door
Stuck in the Dru Hill zone
I'm at step 4
Past love
I stash love
Gas love
Ask love if love even has love
For the one that just loves to be hated
My buzz is the greatest
The drug of the matrix
I'm so high I'm above the internet
And you're in my world when I plug you in your neck
I love how niggas bug out when daddy's gone
Like I ain't got reach like a daddy long
You caught in the web
Off with your head
I gave you niggas the boot
So it's off with ya leg
Not here to be copied
No one's near that can to stop me
I'm Jeremey Shockey
I dare you to pop me
Cause I'mma giant
And you don't devour nothin
So just chill I got my finger on the power button

[Hook x2]
Where's my fcking genesis?
I can't find my fcking genesis!
I wanna get my genesis back!
I wanna get my genesis back!

[Verse 2]
I got a lot of animosity brewin
There's a chance that a lot of people possibly knew the prophecy
And that's that I'll be the hottest in music
So the fans and lames are just watchin me prove it
But just cause you know me it ain't lottery stupid
Cause who the hell took a lot out of me? You did
Can you copy me
Prove it
I'm way to regal
I'm on my Shawn Connery cool shit
And I'm not a loser
I just don't like playin
So I'm here to take over the game
And I'm so cool
And I'm so damn handsome
These hoes can't get off my name
Get off of my name!
Soooooo
If you want hits I got em
Noooooo
I'm not gonna hit rock bottom
You wanna look at a loser
I'm not him
Get hit wit a bat man
Ya face is like gotham

[Hook x2]
Where's my fcking genesis?
I can't find my fcking genesis!
I wanna get my genesis back!
I wanna get my genesis back!

[Verse 3]
I'm so dope
(How dope are you?)
I can ask dope how dope are you
Check the tracks
Game over check the stats
Never wack
And I ain't gotta bring sexy back
Until the end of time
I'mma kill em with the rythmes
They get shot once
Now these niggas wanna shine
Throw a little jab
Now these niggas wanna whine
So I hit em a .40
Gun Licenses comin shortly
I'mma big dog
Bitch you're a yorkie
With the cheese I'mma ? like corky
Pandora's bottle
I dare you
Uncork me
I'm not a child you don't have to support me

How dat feel
And you can bring the hook in
Riiiiiiight now!

Where's my fcking genesis

[Talking]
Yeah! It's Charles Hamilton
Demevolist Inc
I'm the president, b
What the heck do you think?
Not nan nigga steppin to me
I'm not a treadmill
You will be dead still
So go ahead and walk you will get killed

[Hook x2]
Where's my fcking genesis?
I can't find my fcking genesis!
I wanna get my genesis back!
I wanna get my genesis back!
