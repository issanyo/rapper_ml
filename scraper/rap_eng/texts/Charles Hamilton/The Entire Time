And I'm ready to jam. Got a weapon in my hand. Like Tekken when I dance. Throw out a TEC when I enhance. The best friend of dancing, except I don't dance. Better than most veterans, except THEY want a chance to either show that I deserve the heave-ho. O-R to prove to hoes that the loser is so official. Professional is the adjective.

I caught you sleeping while I'm with you
I caught you sleeping while I'm with you

Gotta pick up where I left off at: When it's all a wrap when I talk from the wrap. Because I'm the one that caused the wrap. I want to close my eyes and rap.

And if I'm not that, grab that, bag that, have that. Dropping more bombs than what's over Baghdad. No hell to go. Nowhere else I Hell I would stay, other than my place. Prodigy just got replaced

I caught you sleeping
I am your alarm
So while you're creeping
I'm with you
I caught you sleeping while I'm with you
I caught you sleeping while I'm with you

Let's set the record straight. I deserve respect today. I'm like seconds away from killing the enemy, dead in his face.

When you play from your grave no one else wants to play, nowadays. I'm too loud for the sour and haze. But you know that I'm getting better than Bowser, when I get loud with my dancing
