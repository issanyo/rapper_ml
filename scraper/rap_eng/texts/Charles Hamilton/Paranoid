You can laugh now. Oh, you laugh now
But when the smoke from the pistol clears, you gon' cry later

Assassins watching me. After they blast they gots to be somewhere laughing casually, or cockily, I mean cocky but "cockily" is an adverb, actually. So to describe their actions
They happily be laughing at me because they blast their heat to have me looking like an athlete at a track meet after fucking a hurdle up. Exactly, my knees, my ankles bruise from the middle of it. You call it a shin, I call it a "then again..." My shins are titanium I might live to win. And I'll never live to win. Sometime times I think I might never live again. That metal, which is matching my shins, ends up on my dome. And then...

You can laugh now. Oh, you laugh now
But when the smoke from the pistol clears, you gon' cry later
