I don’t even feel like rapping anymore. Who am I rapping to? What am I rapping for? I ask for more war because I’m the war target of love, but it’s hard to remain Charles in this stuff. So many people saying “Charles, just give up!” or “Charles, just get up and fight!”, but I do it with the mic. And I feel fine. And feel right. But it doesn’t feel right. I don’t feel bright. All my information is leaking is slipping. I been going to Google to take a peek at what’s missing. And now it’s harder to be in the position of me, because I’m spitting to me, as if I don’t get it. And I just want the world to understand me. At the same time, I just want a Grammy. I’m not Chance, b. Even though my music is free, it’s more than just music to me

So, when I find out what I’m missing
I will gladly climb out of this position
And walk to yesterday
Yesterday

I will gladly walk to yesterday

On behalf of every rapper, fuck Drake. You got your bars, but you’re just a cupcake. And I’ma leave it there. You know why we beefing, dear. I’d sweep the tears off your face with a .38, but I ain’t got the gat. So the problem is that. Soon as I cop one, I’ma pop it at your hat. Niggas is becoming my friends so that they could be running shit with him. I understand it, but then again, I’ll be God damn! Don’t be a bandit because a nigga’s so candid! These niggas acting like they Manwich. Gotta eat ‘em, but they’re sloppy. I gotta beat ‘em. Problem is, I ain’t gotta see ‘em. These niggas don’t even belong in my coliseum. This is my house. I’m representing me. Deadly as it gets. Don’t ever forget me

So, when I find out what I’m missing
I will gladly climb out of this position

My thought process has been diminished! I thought Charles was constantly in it! But constantly, I’m getting finished by these guys wishing to be my diminishing line. The finish line is near me! Clearly! I feel like slitting my wrist like Clery. I already did it, and I’m still living, so, “Dear Me. You ain’t gotta do it again!” So all, fear me! When I take the rites of passage to become the Right Man that’ll slice your ass into half with a pitch fork, it is a sport. And I’ll be God damn if I ain’t finish first! With a verse, I can spit the worse shit. But it is persevered when I get perverse with it. That means I’m keeping it mean. Keeping it clean. It’s not even Tide. I’m just being me

So, when I find out what I’m missing
I will gladly climb out of this position
