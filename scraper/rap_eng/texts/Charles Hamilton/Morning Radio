[Intro]
Like a bacon, egg, cheese and a roll ...ketchup and...
Yea, this is my orange juice

[Verse 1]
As the sun rises, I have to punch time in
Clocking the hours to box what loud jumps of silence
Some eyelids widen at the thought of walking tall
But thoughts of mindless timing and washing minds are blinding
High as Washington Heights, election season has passed
Except in speeches are all a draft in fall season
After all, who can pass a law and dawn
It dawns on the law that all the fallen are gone
Protect and serve, with breakfast first
Pedaling words on the curb where veterans lost their nerve
Never get crossed
Lettuce-heads get tossed for the berg of ice
Let us get in the head of the burglars
Who like to collect embedded words of life from out of life's curves
And not by driving either
I try to keep my mind a secret
But why even try when every time I proceed to chime in
My open mind becomes a fucking dine-in...or drive-in
Depends on who's driving
Crosshairs, it's who I IM
Prove my kindness to who might like to try to lose guidance
By trying to hide behind the fact
I like to rap and I lose my mind when I write the tracks
Find the shit again when I get behind the mixing boards
I'm hip to the floor, I hop to the sky
Getting bored with intercourse, I'm getting top from your mind
That's the type of ovulation that you're not gonna find
Gynophobic, cause I'm not rocking with guys
Genophobic, I know I'm a G, but to be honest, I'm shy
And just look at the clock when the shine is too sublime to hide from
You know who I am
Going postal, my IM is offline until I sign in

[Hook]
Good Morning
Pick up my morning paper
And I'm on my way

Good Morning
Showing love to all my neighbors
And enjoy my day

Good Morning, morning
Good Morning, morning
Have a Good Morning, morning

Whenever you hear the....

[Verse 2]
The caffeinated motivation
Have to say I'm motivated to pass the moment of awakening masturbating
Natural, but debating if you have to know what I'm saying
To know that I'm basically a day know I'm a day with no snow in May
Average Maybe, but on the verge of a new age
Morning surges of groove makes a boring day too late
It's so quiet for the crickets, snowflakes dying for a listen
But they so hate snow-fried antennas
Freezer burn, when will the speakers learn
Tea in my cup, reading up on what herbs I need to learn
From my recently secreted sperm
Even Jesus needed a learners permit
So I spit these words as charming as Kermit being a hermit
Hi-O, no disrespect, but I know
My cup runneth over, watching the Muppets cause I'm older
Insanity and profanity are family so I say "Fuck it, I'm sober"
Cutting up and getting bolder cause...what the fuck slut, I'm getting older
Still looking at my cup, it stops running
The blessings are like me when I'm awake, won't stop coming
Since the cup runneth, I tell it to go stop something
It stops my thirst, now I can drop this verse
And watch the clock as it works
From beginning to end
And you're just beginning to be my friend

[Hook]
Good Morning
Pick up my morning paper
And I'm on my way

Good Morning
Showing love to all my neighbors
And enjoy my day

Good Morning, morning
Good Morning, morning
(Have a) Good Morning, morning

Whenever you hear the....
