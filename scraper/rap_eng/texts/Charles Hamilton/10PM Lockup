Bipolar activist high and low backflips
High-coasting accidents regarding the wave
I'm the Max B of maxi-pad bleedings
Snap on each track and ask for a beating
I relapse on Jack Daniels
Squeeze capsules of breathing in the back of my teeth
My scratch has my penis bleeding
But I'm a peeing clean bastard
I burn lady liberty for being me
Her candle still yearns and these children learn
My pills learn to chill but chill, yearn first
I miss Porter, very badly
We haven't spoken in so long it's scary actually
I left cos I could barely have she
Does she still love geriatric me?
This theatrical scene is only magical when it's we
A Sonya Blade kiss of death finishes me
I'm still going
And my heart is still snowing
My chest is still glowing

Welcome to the confines of my heart
Welcome to the confines of my heart

Peace to Tyler, peace to SonSon
I'm still dumb young but an old school rhymer
I took over NY like Slimer
Painting the city pink with a blue primer
I won't lie I took a shiner was shining
Fine then cut a deck and go find him
No cheque to cut so his other work doesn't measure up
Meanwhile I'm never messing up
My work is like...
My work is first class like x-men
My worst enemy is my best friend
My metal friend steps in to protect then his flesh gets stretched thin
Escape death how is what I say to my now when only death checks in
I'm out of words but never out of verbs
I want fear to get out of my nerves
I spend most of my holidays locked away
A lot of days tolerating games my father play
Somethings I gotta try not to say
Everything else comes out in honest ways
But I gotta say

Welcome to the confines of my heart
Welcome to the confines of my heart
Only you can dive into my heart
You ain't going nowhere without me
You ain't going nowhere without me

I'm in this bitch
You can't see my dick like Peter Griffin
Same song writer asking if we need religion
Royalis ing women, same time sleeping with them
Keeping them interested in leaving when finished
I thought Civil was the one, same with Simone Marshall
To pick one and to say woman are a car show
Sacrificing bad vices good wishes
Hood rib tips, they some good bitches
And I move one
Karron and Simone, no cat scan, just battling alone
You ever have a battle with a loan?
I would much rather get the chrome than be rattling my dome
But ratchets leave you blown
Love blows me away
Just hold me and say everything is okay
In the most OD of ways
I pick some, I choose some
I win some, I lose none

Welcome to the confines of my heart
Welcome to the confines of my heart
Only you can dive into my heart
Yo
You ain't going nowhere without me
You ain't going nowhere without me
