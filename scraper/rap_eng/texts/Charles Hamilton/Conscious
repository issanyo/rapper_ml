I can be your conscious
I can be your conscious
I can be your conscious

[Verse 1]
You got a lot of control girl
I got a lot of patron girl
I'm so lost in my own world
Let me take you with me, come on girl
This could be...
Another milestone in history
If you receive this kiss from me
You will instantly...
Be aware of all the little senses
We could be our own creations
We are both artists
Cupid is armed, then we are both targets
If lust is rap, then we are both garbage
And I just wanna show you what art is
Imma try my hardest
You got a man but your mind with God
Ever since you met me, your mind just lost it
So listen to me like I'm your conscious

[Hook]
Let me be your conscious
Everybody got, everybody got one
Let me be your conscious
Everybody got, everybody got one
Conscious
Everybody got, everybody got one
Conscious
Poison is just a boy and I'm not one
Conscious
Everybody got, everybody got one
Let your conscious be your guide

[Verse 2]
You don't wanna lose me
Guaranteed there will not be a To Be...
Continued but the end of this movie
Or a preview, what the sequel
We could get so high like crewly
Cause when we kick it you scream like Bruce Lee
I'm your conscious
You don't wanna lose me?
But I'm your conscious
Feel free to abuse me
That's what I'm here for
I'm over here, but I'm there more
Therefore, I'm the voice that you hear more
You hear more but you wanna keep me here more
But if I'm there more, you'll be something that I care for
Rest your mind pretty flower, you appear lost
Turn the music off, lady you could hear more
Not a dream, it's as real as it gets
Your body is a letter, sealed with a kiss
Let's read

[Hook]
Let me be your conscious
Everybody got, everybody got one
Let me be your conscious
Everybody got, everybody got one
Conscious
Everybody got, everybody got one
Conscious
Poison is just a boy and I'm not one
Conscious
Everybody got, everybody got one
Let your conscious be your guide

[Verse 3]
You got a lot of control girl
I don't have a lot of cologne girl
But I'm still coming on strong girl
And I don't wanna think that you're the wrong girl
Just listen to the song girl
I could get you higher than a bong girl
You're the lighter for the fire and the bong girl
Feeling lighter but the fire isn't gone girl
I'm so gone girl
So grab my hand and we gone girl
Passion in public, we'll stop caring
Hearing Jill Scott and Gil-Scott Heron
I got the bottle and we take a long walk
When we have a long talk till the song goes off
But don't get upset, it ain't over just yet
Cause you ain't even sober up yet

[Hook]
Let me be your conscious
Everybody got, everybody got one
Let me be your conscious
Everybody got, everybody got one
Conscious
Everybody got, everybody got one
Conscious
Poison is just a boy and I'm not one
Conscious
Everybody got, everybody got one
Let your conscious be your guide

Let me be your conscious
Everybody got, everybody got one
Let me be your conscious
Everybody got, everybody got one
Conscious
Everybody got, everybody got one
Conscious
Poison is just a boy and I'm not one
Conscious
Everybody got, everybody got one
Let your conscious be your guide
