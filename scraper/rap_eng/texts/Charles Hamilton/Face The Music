[Intro]
Uh, check me out
Charles Hamilton

[Verse 1]
My hood is gentrified so the soul is leaving
So are the people who need a reason to stay
Perhaps the finances and a chance for the sky
You have to try the manuscript of handling mine
I had to grind, I'm not satisfied
The Harlem Dr. Dre is how I need to be defined
Master of music and given a second try
I'll never die
When I get my grammy, you better cry
If not it's back to crate diggin'
And base hittin', I stay spittin'
Too great to make a decision

[Pre-Chorus]
When I face the music, I just give it my all
Write my problems down and let my spirit make a call

[Chorus]
Time for us to face the music
Police brutality, third world casualties
Sometimes I feel, I am too awake for music
Casual blasphemy, nigga's needin' batteries
Time for us to face the music
Police brutality, third world casualties
Sometimes I feel, I am too awake for music
Casual blasphemy, nigga's needin' batteries

[Verse 2]
The fat lady is tuning up the orchestra
Is picking the music up, this life sucks
We eat waste, bureaucracy
In each state, everyone is territorial
There the story goes, American decency
Gone with the Maury show
Computers are computing more that what we know
Turn off your phone and zone to find the truth
You might find you, then what are you to do?
Money is an incentive to be wicked
Don't be afraid to be different
You're an individual

[Pre-Chorus]
When I face the music, I just give it my all
Write my problems down and let my spirit make a call

[Chorus]
Time for us to face the music
Police brutality, third world casualties
Sometimes I feel, I am too awake for music
Casual blasphemy, nigga's needin' batteries
Time for us to face the music
Police brutality, third world casualties
Sometimes I feel, I am too awake for music
Casual blasphemy, nigga's needin' batteries

[Bridge]
Time for us to face the music
Sometimes I feel, I am too awake for music
Time for us to face the music
Sometimes I feel, I am too awake for music

[Chorus]
Time for us to face the music
Police brutality, third world casualties
Sometimes I feel, I am too awake for music
Casual blasphemy, nigga's needin' batteries
Time for us to face the music
Police brutality, third world casualties
Sometimes I feel, I am too awake for music
Casual blasphemy, nigga's needin' batteries
