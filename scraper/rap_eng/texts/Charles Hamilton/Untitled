So. this joint is specifically for you to twerk when you "get" the beat. I mean, hear it. Intermittently, infinitely it could be me producing music of which you and only you can sing when I do my thing. And I don't need to swing, you're not Briana. And I don't need to think that you're NOT Rihanna. Because Rihanna, in folklore, is the Devil's wife, I say no more. Like Mac-N-Easy when I put a Spud on the top of my gat, looking for love. Blasting (*actually* blacking). Yo, Diamond, what actually happened?! Then again, it doesn't matter I'm blacking a new chick: music. Let's get it cracking

I wan't you to love me like
No one you've ever loved before
Don't be embarrassed, it's just me
All I ask is that you believe
Just believe

I wish I produced "New York Raining" the first time. Then I might disperse the worst rhyme to make this dime who I was calling perfect feel my hurt. But, in time, I revealed the style of which was kind of real to them children who was trying to yield to my feelings. I'm kind of ill when I spill shit. My rhymes are chill and I'm chilling. No mask on, I'm a villain. But I see the future, too. Shame on me for saying he's beautiful. Oh, my goodness! I didn't write this. No iPhone. No, I don't! (When it comes to writing.) So come, exciting. Come all over my face. Come on, it's not in writing

You're thinking about marriage. I'm thinking about getting over some chick named Jamarris. 6th grade, plus 4. I am not bitch-made. She was in the 10th, I was 11th. Feeling heaven. But then again, I was the most devilish. The Dude, on some Devin shit. Something I will never get. I used to want to be the first Black president. But since music comes to me to effortless, I guess I can forgive the steps of which I'll never take. And I just want to levitate, hold on your palm. Going on and on. Still getting over Simone. In some senses, that's going over your dome
