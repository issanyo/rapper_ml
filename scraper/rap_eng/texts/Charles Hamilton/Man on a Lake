Verse 1: [Kevin Scampoli]
Once in tune, the townie drew
His sword, a pint of brew at noon
He delved into a nasty tune
One about a lasting feud
One he calls a bitter duel
One of which he wants removed

Hook: [Kevin Scampoli]
A man on a lake
Can't be fooled
A man on a lake
Can't own pools

Verse 2: [Kevin Scampoli]
The townie sings of a drive
Alongside the mountainside
He told us that his car was white
And how it almost died that night
He stayed all the way to the right
He feels now like those truckers might

Hook: [Kevin Scampoli:]
Trapped in strife
Meant for life
As if she was his wife
A man on a lake
Can't be fooled
A man on a lake
Can't own pools

Verse 3: [Hambino:]
Man on the lake
Like bard
I been going hard
Crushing Philly runs
Or running out to cut
Up Philly cigars
We on the bleachers
Catch a whiff a smoke
A glimpse of the stars
And get reminded just how
Little we are
Tell em imma be great
Just put me on the hook
Or bridge or guitar
I'm blastin’ off
I go from earth
Right to the middle of mars
Been on my own
Been on my guard
My bro and sister were gone
Been through the wars
Look at my hart it's tarched
And riddled with scars
Kept swingin'
Fuckin' stayed here
I had my weapon swingin'
Pwning noobs before you came here
I had my hand up on a big bag of dolja
My tool ain't in a holster
Yellin if you want me
Come and get me imma roast ya
Aye don't you know down
In the bay they call me Philly mon
Been chiefin' like a indy ann
And ballin' like i’m griffey’ son
I’m game no practice
On the green like the masters
Light the dutch master after
The action and all the blood splatter
