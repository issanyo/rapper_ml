I fell in love with the bottom, spotted you there. Therefore, this has gotta be fair. You gotta be near, I probably dare to take you up on your offer right there. Quite clear my fear resides in your eyes and what you hear resides from the lies that I am not trying to tell. I'm trying to prevail as long as I can as strong as I am holding out my arm just for the 'Land. But is it even worth it? Y'all call me perfect but it's y'all that I'm nervous of. And that's word to love, so just turn it up. The perfect love what I can offer you if only distance is what I don't have to talk to you

Chances are you could be the only one to love me
Tell me how that makes you feel?
Chances are you could be the only one to love me

I fell in love with the bottom, spotted you there. I feel like you gotta be near. Looking at a lock of your hair, I cut it off before you cut me off, just to touch it because it's soft. I'm in  love with your walk, everything that you love to offer. I want to talk to Her. You are the Her. I offer Her a walk-through fur. Since I am governed by the highest lover I am covered by the smothering sauce of governing what's the boss. Knowing I ain't strong enough but I hit a bong and Dutch. Along they come the problems but I eliminate them when I date them. Don't be a problem even though you are. And that was supposed to be a superb bar

Chances are you could be the only one to love me

Yo Dilla, how does it feel to become a sample? Now you a real, alive you are even if you don't reside with the stars. Pick which one, this is the one. I make hits for fun but the system don't acknowledge it. It's like a scholarship when you been fucking up. So I guess that's what's up with love. They ain't gotta toss up the name of the highest guy. I aim for the highest sky, take it by surprise and then I make it my wife. When I make it make it at night. So if I see you in the sky, that's cool. I laid the pipe to what you're behind, that rules. And I'm behind that fool, just minding the rules as a man
