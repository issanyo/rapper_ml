[Verse 1]
America got a thing for this gangster shit, well I ain't got it
So if different shit is wack to you, don't cop it
I can only be honest in the shit that I write
Take a trip through my life
Visit the vivid imagery I'm giving you twice
One with the beat, the other when I'm spitting precise
You can't help but say this nigga is nice
But if I don't make a tech spit, you won't respect it
Or cop the record, so fuck it, let me get reckless
If I like that shine on your necklace
I'ma bust shots, go Shyne on your necklace
Drop-top sped off 'fore them hot shots let off
Now your ass can't wear shine cause you're neckless (haha)
Shit, let's get serious people
Real shit really isn't real to you people
This is my life, fuck what you write
This is my genre, fuck what you like, I got

[Hook]
No real family, no real friends
No real escape, no real end
So I'm gon' die with my music
By my side, and that's true shit
No good liquor, no good bud
No good pussy, no good drugs
So (music is the only love)

[Verse 2]
You ever had a fuckin' conversation with a song you sampled?
Smoking as much weed as the bong could handle
I was high looking for some inspiration
A way that I could talk through the beat itself
Then I put on some Graham Central Station
Track 9 on the album, Release Yourself, it said
(Music is the only love)
Hell mothafuckin' yeah, it's the only love
I'm never lonely cause it just only trust
That if it needs me, I'll be there, and vice versa
Can't say the same about these phony fucks
When I was laying in the hospital bed, hooked to an IV
No one even cared if I'm dead, ain't want to find me
Music was right there, my life was touched
So I love music twice as much, sometimes I feel I got...

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Sleepin' on the 2 train, freezing cold
18 years old, wearing pink and gold
No desire to live, nowhere I need to go
Dead tired, but wired from weed and coke
E and dope, speed and anything that could help me
Leave this hopeless state of mind,God saw me, he would note
Forgive me God for saying, "Leave me alone"
He forgave me, and he gave me
The best thing thats ever happened to me
That's the treble and the bass clef
Turns out that I had it since a baby
Because of pain, I lost sight of it lately
This whole world makes me crazy
But not music, music just makes me
I don't make music, music makes me
So, you can hate me, music appreciates me

[Hook]

[Outro]
Can y'all hear me out there? How y'all feelin?
What's real for you? What comes from your heart?
My music comes from my heart
So this is dedicated to anyone who puts music first
If you would rather sing than breathe
If all you had left in your body
Was the ability to play your instrument, would you?
If so, this is for you
If you would write a song with your own blood as ink
This is for you
Music is not just an expression, it's an art form
It is a tourniquet to the bleeding heart
Music is the helicopter that saves your soul
From the hurricane of life
If music is all you got, this is for you
(Music is the only love)
