[Intro]
Uh, uh, yeah, okay, shout out to (Charles Hamilton)

[Verse 1]
I'm a Speck kid, and I rep East Lansing
In and outta shows where they know we do the damn thing
Choes keep asking about the rap thing
"Who's Packy?" That's me
E, Boogie, Bruce P, Skeem, baby that's team
Get acquainted, entertainment at its greatest
People either love us or they love to hate us
Either way, it's gravy 'cause you're helping in making me famous
That's why I mess with my city
'Cause they all know what the name is
S to the P, E to the C-K
Girls wanna cut and they don't speak to the DJ
Hey, what you know about it?
We be getting sauced
Repping floss everywhere that we go about it
Yeah, holler at me when you see me
Tell me that you got The Speck all over your CD
Believe me, I'ma flow 'til I hit ceiling
So, where the choes at? Prolly where the shows at

[Chorus]
See I had a couple b-roads (broads) out in GR but
Ain't nothing like a EL girl
I been outta town messin' with a girl up in Mount Pleasant
But ain't nothing like a EL girl
That chick in Ann Arbor could only be my DL girl
'Cause she ain't nothing like a EL girl
Damn sure ain't nothing like a EL girl
Da-damn sure ain't nothing like a EL girl

[Verse 2]
And that's real girl, truer words never been spoken
These choes provokin', hopin', to get your boy open
But no can do
If these college kids score, then a pro can too
And I'm a pro ma'am who's, programmed to go
Never heard of nerves
I'm straight A's when we're talking bout learning curves
Man, this'll prolly make you madder
But if you think she's bad, then my friends already had her
Damn, I'm only kidding, but really though
Even when I mess around (around) I can really flow
Master of the microphone, wizard with the wordplay
She asked me for some food for thought, I fed-her-off like Sergei
Hey, and that's word to Motown
Login to REFS, get the password to cho-town haha
And I ain't worried 'bout my GPA
This is for the bitties in my city and it's PDA

[Chorus]
See I had a couple b-roads (broads) out in GR but
Ain't nothing like a EL girl
I been outta town messin' with a girl up in Mount Pleasant
But ain't nothing like a EL girl
That chick in Ann Arbor could only be my DL girl
'Cause she ain't nothing like a EL girl
Damn sure ain't nothing like a EL girl
Da-damn sure ain't nothing like a EL girl

[Outro]
Ain't nothing like a EL girl
Ain't nothing like a EL girl
Ain't nothing like a EL girl
Damn sure ain't nothing like a EL girl
Da-damn sure ain't nothing like a EL girl
