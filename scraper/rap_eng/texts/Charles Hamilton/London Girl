(Charles You gotta Expand your horizon)

(fan em' out)

(Gotta Open Your mind)

[Verse 1]
You know
You know who It is, where I'm from, what I love
Regional Pimpin but I live a cut above
I stay dressing down, Model ladies Cuddle Up
The rose from concrete, Your Girlfriends buttercup
Smooth as a loser, rough with another cup
Music abuser, Rough with another touch
Who could be truer than the one they call future
Dude I'm the future, you crystal ball users
Chase cut time, I need a wild woman
Amazonian, Clothes out of style woman
Like, not dressing Retro but walk around the house like clothes are outta style woman
Stay mad at me, I'm like smile woman
If the sun don't shine I'll let her smile push it
She ain't even gotta be from Brooklyn or earth even
Just take my breath away, make air worth Breathing

[Hook]
I need a chick who ain't in her right mind
I'm looking for a London Girl, Shes a London Girl
She got hips and shes Out of her mind
I think I got a London Girl, She's a London Girl
She's a London Girl, She's a London Girl, She's a London Girl, She's a London Girl
She's a London Girl, She's a London Girl

[Verse 2]
I had this bad bitch up town, she was Whoa!
I had to take a cab uptown to see the Ho
Sorry, but she bad and her mouth be a Zone
Not getting head but she Spazzes Out because shes Cold
During Summertime, kinda sick right?
Say the wrong thing to her and get a quick right
She hears the beat that I made and says Quick, Write
My bars are her walls, Shits Tight
Her lips are like poison Ivy's
I'm like Robin I'm immune to the kiss that leads to Doom
Pick a scene, I'm too in this dream to move
Picturing Seeing the Nude, and she ain't even nude
Shes in her birthday suit and It Halloween
She gets naked, shes the Shadow that Follows me
And I'm blackin, the opposite of Sammy Sosa
She wants a Threesome the day I bring the Family over

[Hook]
I need a chick who ain't in her right mind
I'm looking for a London Girl, Shes a London Girl
She got hips and shes Out of her mind
I think I got a London Girl, She's a London Girl
She's a London Girl, She's a London Girl, She's a London Girl, She's a London Girl
She's a London Girl, She's a London Girl

[Bridge]
There I, There I, There I, There I, There I, There I, There I Go
There I Go, There I Go, There I Go
Here I, Here I, Here I, Here I, Here I, Here I, Here I Go
Here I Go, Here I Go, Here I Go
All aboard! Last train to London(to London)
All aboard! Last train to London(to London)
All aboard! Last train to London(to London)
All aboard! Last train to London(to London)

[Verse 3]
I sent Miley an IM with a Smiley
She knows my Screen name and accepted it, (Hi) Cheese
Cracked a smile like, Hey you know something
USA's cool but lets party Out in London
She said SMH is that your G',I got enough money to buy London actually
But since you rap so deep and you You happen to be Sweet
We don't have to be Discreet, lets practice being eesh!
Told her; call Raven Selena maybe Christina
We could lay up in a pig pen, or stay up at big Ben
Spending Time with the Disney Chicks
Hillary Duff me on some Lizzy Shit, Call me an Idiot
I said Why? she said cause I'm mad local
I told her One yourself, Damn she mad Hopeful
I'm Sick of Day to Day, how bout' Day to Night
If I have a bad day I'll just say goodnight

[Hook]
I need a chick who ain't in her right mind
I'm looking for a London Girl, Shes a London Girl
She got hips and shes Out of her mind
I think I got a London Girl, She's a London Girl
She's a London Girl, She's a London Girl, She's a London Girl, She's a London Girl
She's a London Girl, She's a London Girl
