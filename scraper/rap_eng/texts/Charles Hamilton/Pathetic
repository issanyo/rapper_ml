That looks like an 8. Y'all niggas got eyes so it looks like an 'A'. I don't know why but I look like I'm in shape. And I fucked some skinny bitch, now she looks like a grape. That's how much cum I placed in her. Now I put my face in her. Then I eat the shit, so I look like Kim Basinger in 8 Mile, riding the white, high on the white. Nobody is as nice as this guy on the mic. And I've been dying to find a guy who is this nice as the mic.  Because this mic is kinda nice. Give dap to the mic, make out with the bitch, take out my dick and then black on the night. Of which the mic was going to be my witch. Pardon me, I'm kinda kinda sipping on some kryptonite, or Herbalife. I need some fucking herb tonight. You heard me, right?

And he ain't topping me off but hey, nigga. Shake her. I don't even know her but I break her in several fucking pieces whenever I take her by the hand like "Goodbye, mankind. I'm high as [inaudible] and I'm... " Damn, I'm drunk right now. I really want to go get jumped right now. A lot of niggas say they want my style. Well, for 100 pounds, or yen, or Euros. You're nobody who could take it. Because I might just get fucking bodies while I'm naked. Looking like a scene in Paid In Full. Majorly cool. And that was major bull. Dilla, take me away. I'm afraid of you. But I'm drink on your beats, what can I say to you?
