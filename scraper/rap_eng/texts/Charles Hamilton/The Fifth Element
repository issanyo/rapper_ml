[Intro]
Yo Harlem, if you don't mind, I'm gonna go back to St. Claire

[Verse 1]
Just one lover, uptown brother
Got my baby, flow kind of heavy
Under-weight lover
Ain't nobody fucking with this dark-skinned brother
Dark-skined but tanned, dark in my hands
Darkness surround but darkness is landing
Right now I'm standing...
In a position they've been trying to put your man in
Who your man friend? I mean your boyfriend
If you listen to me, this good thing is poison
These are your choices: You could get with a loser
Or get with the dude who be whistling Future
And I don't mean like a Drake single
I mean the dude who could break single women in half
Like at the half before the gunshot
Or after the aftermath of one

[Hook]
And when I pull that fucker out
It attracts the gold diggers
With them big old jellies, smuckered out
Make Charles wanna tuck it in

But the truck got the 5th Element like Tucker's in it
Make Charles wanna tuck it in
But the truck got the 5th element like Tuckers in it
Make Charles wanna tuck it in
But the truck got the 5th element like Tuckers in it

[Verse 2]
Grand-mama love me, I got a fuck buddy
Second grade, all these bitches call me ugly
Used to cry tears standing next to my cubby
Then I go to sleep and all these bitches say they love me
What, you wanna hug me?
Be honest, would you fuck me?
Even though I don't be walking the streets all thuggy
Looking at my jersey, probably dirty
Or from the Salvation Army, yeah, you heard me
Throwback plumber, bitch give me your number
I'mma go inside and young her, I'm a plumber
You can get the plunger, Abner Louima
Jesus, I'mma hit it raw then I skeeze her
Yo, be cum or a princess, incest
If I wanna be the king, just in case
And just ingest a nut in your face
Then it comes on your chest, it's still gonna be a dress

[Hook]
And when I pull that fucker out
It attracts the gold diggers
With them big old jellies, smuckered out
Make Charles wanna tuck it in

But the truck got the 5th element like Tuckers in it
Make Charles wanna tuck it in
But the truck got the 5th element like Tuckers in it
Make Charles wanna tuck it in
But the truck got the 5th element like Tuckers in it

[Verse 3]
See me with my black nail polish
Still I'm Sonic
Honestly I'm gothic
Hard to stay honest
I don't know, I got it
Poetic, Po -otic
History-onic, rap jabbing mnemonic
Even when it comes to me rapping, I'm retromonic
I meant the same type, but I am on this shit
And my momma is the engineer, but that's only if you go left
You don't wanna go there, so listen here
Here's what you need to do: Put your hand on my pocket
And if I don't want you there, nigga just stop it
These are your instructions, I am not fucking
With any bitch if she is not sucking
Literally, meaning her thumb
Meaning if she is not a baby, then she is not the one
And I already got my baby, so please come (cum?) from your lungs
Or come for your tongue, or let me cum on your tongue
Fuck it, I'm number one

[Hook/Outro]
And when I pull that fucker out
It attracts the gold diggers
With them big old jellies, smuckered out
Make Charles wanna tuck it in

But the truck got the 5th element like Tuckers in it
Make Charles wanna tuck it in
But the truck got the 5th element like Tuckers in it
Make Charles wanna tuck it in
But the truck got the 5th element like Tuckers in it

And when I pull that fucker out
It attracts the gold diggers
With them big old jellies, smuckered out
Make Charles wanna tuck it in

But the truck got the 5th element like Tuckers in it
Make Charles wanna tuck it in
But the truck got the 5th element like Tuckers in it
Make Charles wanna tuck it in
But the truck got the 5th element like Tuckers in it

Hi Samus
What's going on fuck, I mean hell
On Facebook, it says she's bi...heyyo!
Yo check this shit out, I'm gonna talk over my hook and shit
Tell me why Simone Porter just hit me up
Like I know, I love her, she got me whipped
I fucking Koopa Kinged been through that shit
She got me whipped, had like an 8 hour conversation and shit
I call her ass today, she don't pick up, what the fuck man?
I'm tired of being whipped goddammit
Yo, anybody remember ever seen that Street Fighter movie
Remember when E Honda was getting whipped on his back
And the nigga was like not doing shit
Nigga said, I let my mind wander to other places and shit
Alright, whatever
Charles Hamilton...as a Street Rat!
