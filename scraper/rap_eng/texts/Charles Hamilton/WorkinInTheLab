[Intro]
They Say i be in the Studio Too Much
Thats What i Heard
WHATEVER

[Verse 1]
Diabolical
Psychological
A Logical Pyscho n my Job is to Cycle
Hear a Song n then Make it Obey
Say What i Say to make a Beat Lay in a Grave
While I Press Replay Necrophelia
Kids Love the Music Pedophilia
Flawless Musician From West Coast to Seryia
Let Go of Fear and Just Beg for a Period of Silence
I Grant Such a Wish
Come Back So Dope Woman Stand up to Piss
Can't Love Her Hit Hand Cuff Her Brick
My Addiction to Poverty is Uncanning
But im Rich Im a Cab Youll Never Catch
On Some Danny Glover Shit
My Lethal Weapon is the Speech in this Lesson
Welcome to Biolyracism 101
Find a Spitter i Will Rip Him From his Tongue to His longue

[Chorus]
UNDER YOUR BED
IN YOUR CLOSET
I BE EATING ALL THE MONEY IN YOUR WALLET
I AM A WHATEVER YOU WANNA CALL IT
NOT A RAPPER
HEAR THE LAUGHTER
Muhahahahahahahaha
MUAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
MUAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
MUAHAHAHA HAHA HAHA HA

[Verse 2]
Pullin Rappers Apart From the Gum Line
*SCREAMS*
Thats for Biting my Punchlines
Using the Excess Saliva as Gunshine
To FIRE the Idiot that got these Punks Signed
Im a Cunnin Rabit on some Fast Shit
These Beats ain't Monsters their Unnatractive
I Mean hey Its Not Much that they Can Say
Thats Why They Girl Flashy Thinged me Like Agent J
Im Not Ahead of My Time Its Bed Time
I just Recorded this Song...
OK Im Nice Thanks for the Compliment
Hate for the Honest Escape to the Bahamas
Feels Great to be Hated by Paranas
Under Rated but Rated Face it im the Hottest
Any More Hatred than its a Laser to your Cottage
CHEESE I Photo Finished the Race in College

[Chorus]
UNDER YOUR BED
IN YOUR CLOSET
I BE EATING ALL THE MONEY IN YOUR WALLET
I AM A WHATEVER YOU WANNA CALL IT
NOT A RAPPER
HEAR THE LAUGHTER
Muhahahahahahahaha
MUAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
MUAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
MUAHAHAHA HAHA HAHA HA

[Verse 3]
Im Nicer than Volunteer Prostitutes
Doing Aids Research for some Scotish Youth
But Sicker Than Not Using the Condom
After the Prostitute CLEARLY Told You that she Got the Juice
To Cure has She Has n Just Gave You
Im SO Nice n sICk im SONIC
Dont like How i Spit ill Vomit
If this Song Ain't a Hit Ill Prom It
Meaning Get it Drunk n Force Myself Upon it
I Killed This Beat Like Jean Bonnet
Jean Bonnet So i Think Shes On It
Brought Her in My Bedroom So She Can Palm it
Told i Her Prefer To use My Sidekick
But i Type Quick So i Write Shit
Im A Ogre Nothin To Keep Secret
Flip a Bird at the Internet RETWEET IT

[Chorus]
UNDER YOUR BED
IN YOUR CLOSET
I BE EATING ALL THE MONEY IN YOUR WALLET
I AM A WHATEVER YOU WANNA CALL IT
NOT A RAPPER
HEAR THE LAUGHTER
Muhahahahahahahaha
MUAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
MUAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
MUAHAHAHA HAHA HAHA HA
