I gotta take my time with this one
Aight (DJ SKEE)

[Verse 1]
For your info
I miss being on the block with niggas I came up with
Spitting slick shit I just came up with being that one nerdy dude no one can fuck with
Not scared to say whatever in public
Respected because of my never give up shit
Came a long way from the shell toe in one forty something in a concord sighting far more
Than a flash and a pan
I actually ran the kitchen class that you ran from
The fact that I'm standing means I won't lay down and be put in a box
I hope you haters are looking for rocks, kick em'
I remember looking for rocks to sniff em'
Cops would [?]
Now I gotta [?] for my wisdom tooth being pulled legal drug copping
Whats popping
Not for a buzz i couldn't afford to see a doctor
The one I pay to say I'm okay on my label mate
My day to day is what most pay to say
Or get paid to say I can get laid today
I get so many "Hey Charles it's so and so" phone calls it's overdose
My balls are over soaked
Instead I just call Simone and go ball in tears because y'all don't know me
So y'all can blow me or go along with homie because I'm all me
Most of these ballers are bologna, woah
Don't, ever call me a hipster I'm from the heart not the hip don't start any shit cause

[Hook] X2
Love what you do
And do what you love

[Verse 2]
My ex's mother saw the XXL and thought to let her thoughts be uncovered
How was you homeless but living in my crib?
You got a story but you ain't got to lie shit
Tyranny, that's fucking absurd I was stuck on the curb when justice was served
Or rather when justice served you
Jumped to you and Toya's defense, your boy had no sense
Since then I realized niggas only do you favors cause they know you gon be greater
You're not a hater I appreciate your nature
But I'm real you'll appreciate it later
Besides, the bitch wasn't so bad though sleeping with the rats
Toya sleeping with [?]
That's cold I know I'm still bitter
Lucky for you I ain't the type to kill niggas
Unless I grab the mic to kill niggas
Cause I can end a life for real nigga
Insane membrane like them Cypress Hill niggas
But I had to get sane live life and chill quicker
I caught beef with a 30 year old
I can do him dirty like "Nigga you heard me" but no
Get your money, cause i get mine
Wanna commit suicide then fine
I'm sick of the (Game)

[Hook] X2
Love what you do
And do what you love


[Verse 3]
I'm known for dropping incredible heat
But politics is why I'm not on the incredible beat
Dead ass, hip-hop is that bad, that sad but that cash got cat's mad
He got how many figures from Interscope?
I won't say cause I figure you niggas know
If you don't, good, I want to sleep in peace
Beat my meat to two freaks and get a skeet in peace
Of a napkin, at peace, I'm out
Lyrical masturbation brings peace in my house
So I never forget where I came from
Son of a bullet my family from the same gun
And my name is the pistols hole
Charles Hamilton, this industry shit is over
Let me live let me breathe than life can begin
The end, peace friends

[Hook] X2
Love what you do
And do what you love
[Outro]
Ya dig
Ill do this shit forever in my sleep
Wait t'ill I wake up
