I have entered the back of the minor Sonic. Time to be honest, I am on it. Riding the comet, gliding on the awesome terrain of all brains. We are going to go insane at a rate that people are going to all hate. But hey people got to face-to-face. Moving at speeds truer that breeze. Which breeze can be moving me? The breeze from my feet, I feel it when I run. Stealing the ceiling because I feel I'm number one. The ceiling got me under its thumb. Now I'm under its gun. I'm feeling closed in, got to get out in the open. No wind until I move. Feel my groove, feel my soothing nature. I don't hate you

I still find it so hard, to zone in and out of my Go-Kart
Moving at a speed that is so far
I may need to save it, a day

I know who I meet at the end of the zone. That's why I befriended the zone. I dare anybody to come and enter the zone I'm in. Be it Chemical Plant, I'm still the man. Soon as I exit, I under the Ruin of Aquatics. Problem, Robotnik. You've been trying to make niggas slaves. Slavery is a different page. We are living in today, the day I run. The day I run is the day of the sun. And the way I rise may shake up your eyes, A.I. style. But don't hate because, may I smile? Either way every day I'm wild. I speak the high speech. You might be hostage to the fact that I speak perfect

I went to God for serenity, then went to the enemy. Because the enemies were visiting me in my sleep. So keep my safe and let me procreate with my 8 of a wife. One more time, let the sky show that I am the high hope. And when I'm inside of a hole I stroke and I hope to die in my glow. So whatever comes after, be it danger or disaster. I still won't be a crasher like Pharrell. I'm a thrasher. But not beat on my wife, cheat on my wife. Just be on the mic and pee on you dykes. Niggas can't fuck with the flow. Sonic the Hedgehog, what up to the knows
