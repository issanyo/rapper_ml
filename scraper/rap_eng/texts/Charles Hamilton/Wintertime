I'm in my zone, miss, which means I'm only stolen when I feel your gold kiss. So when you go in, I don't spit. And you been going in so much, I gotta throw up because I'm holding in what I don't spit. You know it's sick cause the flow's sick. Holy shit, can't you notice? Is your third eye open? I'm a magician with it. Spittin lyrics to lift your spirit, not lift it out or give you doubt. I'm tryna kiss you now. Lyrically try to figure out how that shit goes down. A nigga's in the house, tryna make the bad bitches bounce. You the baddest bitch that my eye can account, so why don't you bounce while my eyes don't, eyes don't....

Yes I'm still in love with you, but is it infatuation?

Yo, my only audience is Satan and women. The love that I'm making to women is Satanous gremlins creeping on my back while I'm deep in the cat, tryna make you scream in the sack. The demons react. So does the track, it seems. Other rappers after me. I am the leader of it all and you kissing my ass. That's why your feet are up against the wall. You're face in it too. Cause you know what you basically do is breaking the mood of what I do. It's basically doom with a brighter day. High as haze on a Friday. Pick a Friday, hopefully it's 4:20. All my niggas want more money. Throw the green at me and change a nigga scenery. We want a higher ground

In July, when you think of wintertime, shit could be the bigger lie, which is fine. You don't wanna get your mind intertwined (which is my new favorite word) with July. You're used to the deepest winter. My music is creeping in the center of the deepest ember and member of what we all can remember. You lovin the sound. How bout I govern the ground? So hard I could be snuffing a hound while I'm [?]. Taking mad shit across town. The mad shit is in the magic, and the magic is in the flow and in the prose. Y'all niggas know my shit is dope
