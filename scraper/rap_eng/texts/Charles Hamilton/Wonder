[Verse 1]
A morning begins, the morning do. If the morning is due, while enjoying my morning view, tell the nice sky, nice to know you
Admire the bright sky, son, I would like to hold you
I like to know you reflect me. I would spend my whole life to know you
I could show you the power of your shine, if I can only have an hour of your time
Take a second, enjoy the life you bring
Bright and gleem, reminding me of how nice my dreams are
Blocking my eyes because it hurts. Why do I flirt with death, she don’t like me
I’m a jerk, I won’t die
So I, roll by in the streets, vibing the beats
I’ve been defeated, the winner is me
Listen to me, the beat is why I grin in defeat, cause this shit is sweet

[Hook]
Show me the way to keep my mind from going under...
I’ll be okay, cause I don’t doubt, I simply wonder…
Don’t be afraid. Never belong, never belong...
Own yourself, don’t be afraid to just clone yourself…
And never ever leave your side…

[Verse 2]
You ever wake up, abruptly from chokes in your sleep. You hope it’s the deep motions you creep with, when you in a deep drift of meditation, not from medication
I bet you’re taking a second to understand what I said previously
The reason is easy to comprehend cause the reason is me
I don’t care about what the others say. I just want to make it clear what I motherfucking say goes
You know my name, I landed on earth with it
Beyond gifted, I’m blessed with a curse, dig it
Thank you god, you allow me to hold on, so ima do what I was sent to do the whole song
Let you know, it’s divine when I rhyme
Hence, the reason I go off the mind all the time
My soul flows through the location of my soul glow, not America I’m coming to, I want the truth

[Hook]
Show me the way to keep my mind from going under...
I’ll be okay, cause I don’t doubt, I simply wonder…
Don’t be afraid. Never belong, never belong...
Own yourself, don’t be afraid to just clone yourself…
And never ever leave your side...

[Verse 3]
People to see, places to go, acres to grow, paper to hold
Haters a throw away, cause they old. Major is so play cause you know my nature is gold
Making you go, take some cocaine to ya nose, pain doesn’t show
Only way is if I don’t play with you hoes. I was created alone, raised in a home were hate wasn’t known, breaking the mold was what kept me safe from the cold
Babies, will grow and maybe they’ll know, I would have gone crazy to show you how a day couldn’t hold me
It took an eternity for me to murder me, the mere doubts me, there is no me without me
(And ask for forgiveness) And I… (make a pact to never speak that word again) doubt

[Hook]
Show me the way (It's Charles Hamilton) to keep my mind from going under...
I’ll be okay, cause I don’t doubt, I simply wonder…
Don’t be afraid. Never belong, never belong...
Own yourself, don’t be afraid to just clone yourself…
And never ever leave your side...
