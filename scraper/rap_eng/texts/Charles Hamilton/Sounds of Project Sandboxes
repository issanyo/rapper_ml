I woke up one morning the Apple CEO. What do you know?! And I found out I got this little freaky hoe. What do you know?! She can go wherever she wanna go! I'm gon keep it 100, though. I'ma keep my music playing. What am I saying? I DON'T WANT TO KNOW! I wanna lose control, but I don't ever want to lose my soul. If I do, so? The whole globe goes to J Dilla. And you know! And this beat is so dope! I'm a schoolboy, but I'm a Rude Boy. Gotta enjoy this shit. Ensure. Like breakfast for Kanye's jaw

Who the fuck is doing that?

The nonsense spitting Gothic Biggie. Shit got weird when I got with Iggy. 'Cause I ended up a part of A$AP MOB. They like that crap I jot, but they don't like it when I freestyle. Neither does Mr. "Peace Out". And we know who the piece is. My peace is my thesis: I am the deepest, and anybody peeping can see it. It's time for me to get my chair and shine. Sitting in a hot chair, with dimes. Nigga I am hot here. Got hot hair, like Jackson in his prime. Only when he got that shock from Pepsi. Let's see. "What was y'all tellin' me?"

DAYQUIL, STAY STILL! NYQUIL, I'M ILL! My skills? My pills. Try ill. I'm ill. I'm the kind of guy you would like if you ever thought about committing suicide. And (apparently) the whole world is my girlfriend, and they know it. Take note of the shit, while I'm flowing legit. Not a little schoolboy, but the flow is so sick. If you're not revolting, I'm John Travolta. Pointing out you fuckin' faggots like "Stop the stalking!" You're all on Facebook straight poking me. Pause. But not noticing me. If you walk around with my Potpourri, just watch your back for those hoes with me. Let's go!

I dance to the rhythm of me
But it seems like all of y'all are off beat
Well, keep on dancing!
KEEP ON DANCING!
