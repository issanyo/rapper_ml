[Intro]
It's for all the rings
Haha

[Bridge]
Now-now-now thoughts that might kill me
Are not gon' make you stronger
Cause I been writing for a minute now
But I know you been writing longer
And that is a god damn shame cause
My bars come off way -stronger-
So if you try to go toe to toe with me
Guarantee your ass is a goner

I'm SOBER RIGHT NOWWWW

Nigga get lost aight?
Catch bullets like randy moss tonight
Charles is like an iPod with a bomb in it
Mad songs but if you act wrong, my god you'll be going in it
I'm sorry I'm a nerd and a musician
And a bum, I been living in a soup kitchen
That's what I call it, you call it a studio
Truly though I'm going home in a UFO
Out of this world, outta my mind
Yeah yeah here come the rumors, gossip time
This nigga Charles went crazy, super red carpet
Y'all spit like kid just superhead talking
Yeah I went to Hollywood but I'm still Harlem
Roscoes chicken and waffles ain't in Harlem
I'm doing big things, chasing a big dream
Macing em with sixteens, [mase is in pink]
Jason Meanz is my uncle man
Me high is like him drunk again
So if you sending beef then we jumping in
So don't act like you don't understand
I'm C-H-A-R-L-E-S
Create great bars, hell he's next
He may hate Charles, well he's vexed
That she may date Charles? tell me yes

I'm SOBER RIGHT NOOOW

Back on my grind like I'm going downhill
On a skateboard laying down flat on my spine
Think about it then use your imagination
You'll see that the future's black
If those that don't know my usage for blackin'
It means very vivid, you stupid for asking
Doesn't matter cause the train moves on
As soon as you lose your brain you gone
That's what I say to groupies what god said to me
I'm not gonna be another Pac nigga please
Watch and believe while I rock on a beat
Of a man who I swears been copying me
As for you niggas in the hood, talk behind my back like I figure shit is good
Charles forever laughs at goners

Fuck my ex-wife go ahead nigga do it
The head was the truest like I said nigga do it
I got a buddy list full of black Kate Mosses
I get nothing but bodies like ashtray coffins
Bout time I stop giving fuck, my lyrics
Touch ya spirit when ya hearing this tongue
Lie to me baby tell me that you been faithful
Lie to me nigga nah Charles I don't hate you
Lie to me groupie nah Charles I don't date you for money
I don't know why I should date you
When I snap no super glue
You play me I change colors, rubiks cube
I lost my mind and that's due to who?
You call it real life its my musical
I'm used to dudes telling my bars are a felony
Theo is my lawyer, Charles is a pedigree
Triple H, if all you niggas hate
My situation is reason to call this nigga great
I'm high like what's good and never sober
So the greeting is [never over]
Make room for the flow when I move with the flow
I'm a psycho make you sooohoooo from ya throat
And you're favoring a room full of hoes
Cause you've become a ho in a room full of Joes
Not a jab at Ye but at jab at they
Thugged out in the hood and only act mad gay
And I'm getting laid like the law from these broads
That talk to Charles and his entourage
And at this point I could just have fun and if u don't dig it u just that dumb
Cause I dumbed down to give you this verse and it ain't easy my nigga it hurt
Guess I'm going hard and y'all niggas is tight pissed
Cause I do it like this
Got the game on vice grip
Call it vice city when I spit
I jacked ya car smacked ya broad laugh at y'all quote on quote savage bars
After Charles, nothing, bitch I'm the genesis
No cartridge won't find lint in it
Baddest bitch in the game wearing my chain
I'm fly she fly bearing my name
Yeah you heard that line before I don't care if its lame
My woman is everything so I don't care for you dames
So hurry up and dash save me a rocket
Moving top speed its amy and sonic
And If a nigga get a hint of danger I'm rushing and busting these fucking lyrics
Until there's no more discussion so fuck it *Breath*
