[Verse 1]
Somewhere on the desktop lives
The zip file mixtape of the next pop kid
Let's not kid ourselves, be clear
You see me here I run zShare
And MegaUpload
With my forever steppin' up flow
Just know I'm just wakin' up so
When I yawn, ya'll get more
Not feelin' how I explore
Alt+F4
No one can tell me what I can and cannot do
Tell me be quiet and I holla like Yahoo
Pause
Just in case we got bloggers
Who wanna sit behind keys and start problems
I made the beat, all praise to me
I'm Tom, my Windows, not afraid to peep
So log on like a Jamiacan dancer, download me
Go ahead and take a chance

[Verse 2]
Can't nobody stop me, I'm sorry
I was raised in the concrete Safari
You other clowns got hate in your blood
You talk that new shit with Windows 98 in your blood, what?
I don't need some new fad's endorsement
I'm endorsed by these mad important cats
With more than enough to buy your life
But I'm wireless
And your mice
No strings attached when I sling my raps
Real name when I bring the facts
Seen in your favorite magazine with a great pose
Cause I don't pose
Cause I hate pose-ers
Except for one photoshoot
For Complex, what the heck was I supposed to do
I had fun
I acted mad young
I was flyer than the rest of them
Why am I addressing them

[Verse 3]
You ain't catch when I said put my Mac down
Like I got a girl's top on my lap now
That was mad hot
And mad foul
Now that I said it all here think back now
Mac lipgloss
Mac laptop
Girl's top on my lap, that's mad hot
Wow
How arrogant of me to explain a hot bar
From a track I did for free
Sorry 9th, I thought they took care of that shit
I hope Reo-G don't think I did some wack shit
I know how some cats don't play favorites
But I need a favor alright? Okay player
Tell everyone to stop puttin' up hate posts
Before I find they IP address
And straight ghost
Them
Kill 'em or send em a virus
Let me chill before they hack my girl's Sidekick
