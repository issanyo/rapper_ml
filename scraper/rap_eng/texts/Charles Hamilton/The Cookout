[Hook]
Why you gotta be watching me while I'm just doing my thing?
There ain't nothing right here to see so just let me do my thing
I came up, watched people change up, man the world just ain't the same
Well I ain't going nowhere, don't worry, just let me do my thing

[Verse 1]
So, let's describe me, blessed as I be
I still get stressed, gotta dress to impress
Still get fresh, but the rest that find me
Strange don't care cause the fresh get spoiled
Royal pain in the ass I got a throne in annoying
It's a ocean full of sharks you get thrown in for being annoying
Lost you, didn't I?
Didn't I blow your mind, the Delfonics
You may as well vomit, I'm Pepto Bismol, literally
Your stomach gets sick from this shit
Then I suggest you twist off the cap and digest the pink
I bet you think I can't do nothing for you
This is me for ya, fuck euphoria
Making 16 out of 5 words:
Y'all ain't fucking with me
I do me, that's my state of mind, follow me

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
In my mind I'm at a cookout in Marcus Garvey Park
While I spark the Marley with Nate as my lookout
If I get caught getting high, will they see me?
Nigga I'm really high off the hemi - haze
So if I'm high then the cops'll have to look up
But if they reach up and grab me they gon' look up
My police file, see how I have a warrant for arson
Burning up tracks, forever sparking
Conversation flaming the minds of the retarded
Setting ablaze the work of these feeble artists
Bring ether to my targets, KKK when I'm burning crosses
The one they hang around their neck
It's just a chain, and they don't know a thing about respect
Or why that man died, I'm not going gospel am I?
I'm just saying don't cop it, rock it
And not know a thing about the topic, Got it?

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
I can't feel my face, I'm so high
Or maybe cause it's like 12 degrees outside
Why? Well I smoke Cali from a Phillie in New York
Playing Chicago outside a Chinese restaurant
Maybe the Vodka got a spell on me, this groove should a felony
Trafficking drugs from state to state
Coast to coast, even across the ocean I float
Maybe y'all ain't comprehend the metaphor
I cause a better war between Russia and China
But Cali and New York settle scores, we're pathetic ya'll
This intoxication got me making major mistakes in sobriety
But when I wake up, ain't nobody trying me; born alone, die alone
But misery loves company, so you're all welcome to die with me Finally
In conclusion, introducing, the deepest rapper in the movement
Rather, the pinkest rapper in the movement
I'm pretty sure you getting use to it Charles Hamilton, dammit I live to do this
