Something soulful

Let me thank you for being an angel and understanding my angle. My anger has been what makes me a has-been in my mind. And the kids in the back of these classes they act up cause my shit is mad tough. They want to put a glass up to the sky. Fuck with a guy that doesn't fuck with the public enough to be touching the sky when there's nothing but lights covering the stage. I'm hovering above it in a rage. I like to perform but my life has been living in porn. So I stay to myself excited to be living for chicks who want to get more. They don't know me, but I know them. I guess I such is an omen. Go in

Every time I think about the things you've done for me I just can't sit still, this is how feel
So I never think about the things you've done for me, so I can sit still for you

I have to get patient. Every situation I've been in I've been finding out that I can get out of it, even in the times when I'm out of it. Doubt and wit, all that I have to give. Never spitting accidents and when I do we can chat about it
It must have been Freudian. Let me be that boy again. Enjoy the wind as it blows on your back to the track. Laugh at the track if it doesn't make you hype. You supposed to sit back and relax, listen to the track as it recites all the vibes that you wish to have.  Like the Ghost of Christmas Past, keeping you bound to the sound. You gotta remain down

Every time I think about the things you've done for me I just can't sit still, this is how feel
So I never think about the things you've done for me, so I can sit still for you

I never liked to keep people in the sight of freedom. Or out of the sight, because if you're in the sight of freedom you've been  out of your mind, you've been reaching. I try to keep people on a positive path. I gotta stop with my laughing at the plight of others. I like the others, the others on my side, I am like no other. And they have my back. I ain't gon' laugh at that, I truly enjoy it. Music is poison and I get high from it. But music isn't poison it's just my stomach. I've been ingesting the music which leads to questions from movements. Can I really do this? I don't even do it for the cash, I do it for the fact. Just that

Every time I think about the things you've done for me I just can't sit still, this is how feel
So I never think about the things you've done for me, so I can sit still for you

See, the key to making music is not to me making music for the sake of music that's forsaken music. Despite my angles and all the things I like to think about when I'm making music. There's a formal way to make it. A natural way to make it. Remember that. Thank you
