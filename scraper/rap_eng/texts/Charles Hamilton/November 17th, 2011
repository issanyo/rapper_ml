[Main Verse]
I glow. So I don’t care if dude is my son
Jake One. I’m using my gun
Stay, son. Abuse is my fun
A-1. Treat music like gum. Steak, to some
I’m healthy. No using my gums
Wait for none. Stay awake to cum on the face of a bum
Place her with a one. Chase her with my tongue
She’s my music. My steak. I do stay away
Jewish is my waves (get it?). I pull through and fade
Ruin the fake. Blue is my waist
My boo is Blue and she do get away with saying the most foolish of statements
Who’s in my way? Move them away. I’m stupid. Stupid is great
But you stupid niggas is playin
Too many ways to say I’m the movement of the game
Chang and Chung don’t like me
Shoot in their face with the tool in the place of bamboo rolled with haze
I sumo for days. I do roll the haze. Too close to the grave
Shoot foes in the brain. New hoes on my “thang”
Doing shows in a Range. Moving slow to the fame
UFOs in my lane. Beautiful is my name
Using coke as the flame for the dope in my veins
You should know my name. Who don’t? Are you lame?
Woo smoke hits a plane. Knew, know, it’s the same
Blue coastal waves. Lose? Nope. You’re gay
Just for hoping I would fade
I’m nowhere close to going
Nigga...

[Chorus]
Work Dat Ass Hoe!(x12)
Lately I've been SUCH an asshole, but I
Work Dat Ass Hoe!(x2)



[Chorus]
Work Dat Ass Hoe!(x12)
Lately I've been SUCH an asshole, but I
Work Dat Ass Hoe!(x2)
