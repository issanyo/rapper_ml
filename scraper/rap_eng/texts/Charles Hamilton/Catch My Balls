My mother always said don't be reliant on niggas
Be your own man get defiant on niggas
Never be a sheep be a lion on niggas
Fuck a lion you see the panther on my right arm nigga
These niggas gay wake up lying on niggas
Hit the block get in trouble start lying on niggas
Put a skirt on yeah you Lane Bryant Ya'll niggas ain't shinin
Thats why I stay stylin on niggas
You stylin on who? You crazy Holmes
I'm feeling like Katie Holmes the way that I be stylin on Cruise
Balling till it's over time ya'll know the grindin
Got a clothing line but I'm still stylin on you
Faggot you got Ja Rule's stylist on you
So back down that's why your wack style is old news (old news)
Get your ass found with no shoes
Cops had to chuck the case down with no clues
My reign in the ring endless man
I'm the heartbreaker niggas call me Vince McMahon
The veteran yes, never in debt not owning at all
But I own you all when I cut the rope and you fall
I'm fucking popular, I can't even stroll through the mall
Without hoes hoping that Charles will let them choke on his balls
You open for bars like liquor stores spitting more crack
Your Bobby if he was eating out Whitney all waxed
These Niggas all wack ,why diss them on tracks?
I'll black on their voicemails dare them niggas call back
No star 67 watch the niggas fall back (fall back)
Your full of shit if you live what ya'll rap (ya'll rap)
Get a taste of the future bitch lick a ball sack
Thin line between love and hate, I live across that
Ya'll ain't diggin Charles's tracks? Then kick a log jack
I'm saying It Charles I have a gift but don't sit in Charles's lap
Merry Pinkmas BITCH!

I wanna be the very best
I wanna be the very best
I wanna be the very best
That no one ever was
I will travel across the land
I will travel across the land
I will travel across the land
I know that I know that it's my destiny
Pokemon!
I wanna be the very best
I wanna be the very best
I wanna be the very best
That no one ever was
I will travel across the land
I will travel across the land
I will travel across the land
I know that I know that it's my destiny
Pokemon!
