[Verse 1]

Yea, me I get it in
(Get it In)
I'm the cream of the crop
I'm gon win
(He Gon win)and
I'm the head honcho
Matter fact I get mind blown
When I roll something
That I know
I Wouldn't pass
To the next guy tho
My mom know that
I get lifted but
I'm talented and gifted
And That's A Momas' love
A Gangster turned monster
Because of love
I creep around in my dreams
To catch the scooby doo's
And I'm watching them tip toe'n
Now and they
Creeping around the room
Whoa
I had a dream I's buy my way to heaven
But Instead of seeing Jesus I was forced by police's
To please put the gun down sir now repeated
I mean it was a scene
Like Natural Born Killers
My sister Naya
Your a queen
Make sure I tell Ya
No denying
You know I mean




[Bridge]

Oh my my my
I'm feeling hi
And,My money is gone
And I'm all alone
But you know what I do
And how I roll oh'
Oh what a day
What a day
What a day

People Keep on askin' bout
My money and my worth
Ask about my album songs
And when I'm gona blow
Tell 'em mind they business and
I'm gona' be ok
Just give me
My money
Just give me
My money
Just give me my money
Like ODB

[Charles Hamilton]

All i ask for is to be paid in advance
I stay shaking my hand
Wit People making the land
UnSacred and I can't stand it
Damn it
All I do is cause damage
You are not Charles Hamilton
So do not try to Charles handle it
Charles handle it my momma says
About the trash
So I step up out the class
With a weapon that I dash wit
So I owe my mother my cash
In fact and that's it
You get me paid
I get you laid
Success is a bitch anyway
She loves when I give it to her in the sickest way
Gettin paid getting laid Same time
But it's a wish a way from disappearing
So I get with the children
And this situation here
Is a kid whose worth a trillion
My existence and presence with him
So I listen when I get it in with him
It's a rhythm
C'mon
