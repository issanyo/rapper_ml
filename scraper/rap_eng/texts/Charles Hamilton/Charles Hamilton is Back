[Intro]
I want you to hear me get in the booth just now
I've been watchin'
I've been listening
I've been feeling, I've been knowing
I've been me
My name? (Charles Hamilton)

[Verse 1]
All rise for the Hamilton anthem
Critics that can't stand him
Triggers that can't blam him
Executives that can't ban him
The one pair of Vans not one man can stand in
The one that drops ill product every time
Not luck, I drop such deadly rhymes
The one that got rappers that are barely vets
Chattin' all scary when they barely Halle Berry with their threats
The one that never pulls punches, but accepts them
From a vet or a bitch I was sexin'
And I'm still the big brother on the block
Still a lover, and I'm still the color of a twat
Is that rude? Another word: box
The Bloggerville Slugger, love me or not
I run the Web like "Backslash
H-Double-T-P, Colon," kiss my black ass

[Hook]
Call your friends, all your friends, go 'head, whistle
Tell 'em that it's official
Charles Hamilton is back (x4)
Did you forget my name? (x2)
Charles Hamilton is back (x3)

[Verse 2]
I go off like analog TV
I am a boss, Santa Claus 3D
So gifted, I answer your calls with three hoes
Who stand all tall when they see me
I just went OD deep
Bottom of the kitty, I hope she squeaks
Don't get it now? Don't even speak when it hits you
Just go to sleep for a week
I would've dropped an entire anthology
Bitch niggas crying is what inspired the apology
I'm like MF Doom meets Daria
Meets Star & Buc, meets Charles' nuts
And that means, I'm too hard to touch
Try it, you gonna have Johnny Carson's luck
You should wanna see me daily like Carson does
The interview and performance was raw as fuck

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
These rap people is starting to sound like Enya
So I will eat these bugs, Simba
Top five rappers, I'm not feelin'
Top three musicians: Me, Georg Solti, and John Williams
Going over composers, I'm focused
I sample the dopest, and the piano gets broken
Whenever my hands get to strokin'
Fall off, not by a chance, cause you're hopin'
This isn't written, it's on the top of the head
I put my little homie on, I was plotting, not dead
I heard people wanna pop me for bread
They got a better chance going to a rock for a keg
Not the country, a rock I said
Rocks aren't even dead, snort a rock to the head
Meantime, I'm watching the feds
Who got a problem? Enough said

[Hook]

[Outro]
The only rapper I can beef with and lose at is me
Did you forget my name? (D.S. al capo)
