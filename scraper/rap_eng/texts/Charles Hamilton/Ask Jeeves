My best friend questions my "best friend" mentality. Because of my sin him wanna battle me. But then again, I don't want to come after he. Because he's kinda like "Hi." And I'm the guy he would be reaching when speaking through beats. Too many friends that can make beats. So I guess this would be history for H3, the generation after we. How could I clash with he? Damn. As he grabs the heat to blast me I ask he if he understands what he has done to me. Made me a bigger beast than me. Then the industry want to be in me. Then I blame him. Then I name him the reason I'm taking over like Centipede
