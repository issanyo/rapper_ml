I don't want my baby girl growing up wild in a crazy world. So I got to discipline you, listening to the shit you give dude who may have been against me. When did I be wishing to be free from the breeze to sit you down on my lap while I'm on a rocking chair? The fans want to stop and stare. You're in an all blue Roc-a-Wear velour suit, more you. Award you and applaud you, you're so awesome. And i'm an awesome dude. And you have an awesome mind, we did the awesome "do" before I had a chance to talk to you. So it's an awesome lose, but it's an awesome gain because you are my name. Come on

Treat me like, treat me like, treat me like, treat me like
Fire, fire, fire, fire
Into the pain, into the pain, into the pain, into the pain

If I didn't know better, it sound like you want a kiss from your daddy who's living in the midst. Interesting, you wish to be with me. I wish your mother was, don't want to fuck her up
Just want to love her enough so she could never get another lover who could be like her brother. I know her brothers, I guess they're your uncles. I hope that they don't want you. I don't want to have to scrap for you so I made a brother for you. Yeah, I threw away the rubber for you I starting a whole family tree. Can it be we, can it please? Don't touch my pee-pee, you so nasty girl. I just don't want you in this nasty world

Treat me like, treat me like, treat me like, treat me like
Fire, fire, fire, fire
Into the pain, into the pain, into the pain, into the pain

You got your own rhythm, your own little twist. I love this shit, fuck it though. Come get with the kid who will cut the jugular of your bro, or whoever the dude is. It's music and officially you have the throne. After me, actually. You may have inherited it, I don't care a bit. Let me stare and the shit, because I only care for you and your wig, go 'head and toss it
New Beyonce, name in the faucet. New C H, cold and hot. You're supposed to be hot so you know you're hot. And if not, well, I guess that's genetics, always walking around feeling pathetic cause you better than everybody. Your fetish is to body everybody. Please don't let it body you

Treat 'em like, treat 'em like (fire) and walk through it, walk through. I'ma treat you like that too, see how you like it

I love you, baby
