[Intro]
Charles Hamilton
Charles Hamilton, eh whatever
STH

[Verse 1]
Yeah, dropping out of class cause the teacher was my student
My music being the ruler to prove to them I knew it
Too many losers knew that they blew it
So they hope that I might forget, but I'm the truest and they know
O, the phrase that resembles a ring
Bling bling, then you won't remember a thing
A little bit to drink, a little bit of pink
And you wish to be me, living in the biggest dream niggas seen
A dictine, my 16's are nicotine
I just smile when I don't know what you niggas mean
The only time I don't stand annoyed
Is when I can enjoy the noise of Brandon Boyd and the band
Damn, I destroy what I land on
You ain't a man, you a boy with a tampon
And they tell me I don't get it

[Hook]
I don't get it, can you say it again?
Oh that's what you mean, can you say it again?

Can you say it again?
Can you say it again?
Can you say it again?

Same old, same old
I ain't never change, I'm the same old lame-o
Tell me that you ain't know
I ain't never change, I'm the same old lame-o
Tell me that you ain't know

[Verse 2]
These suckers try to rhyme, but they can't rhyme like this
And I'm the shit, damn I'm legit
You need a little evidence, needles aren't heaven sent
But I visited the Genesis via an Exodus
To a trip down to no-man's land
Like a single female, both hands fanned
I broke and slam danced her soul, for a chance to grow
Bam bam bigolo for sure
I keep flying even if my head pops
Dead from a drop wrestling in death's sweatbox
Life is estrogen, monogamous to who?
I gotta hit it, god I miss it, obviously you do too
I said to Miss Opposite of Death
Dead wrong, but the opposite of left
Nothing wrong with writing about people
But since people live, am I writing about evil?

[Hook]
I don't get it, can you say it again?
Oh that's what you mean, can you say it again?

Can you say it again?
Can you say it again?
Can you say it again?

Same old, same old
I ain't never change, I'm the same old lame-o
Tell me that you ain't know
I ain't never change, I'm the same old lame-o
Tell me that you ain't know

[Verse 3]
I ain't trying to say that my words are the law
But what law governs a governor
What fucking nerve are these pervs to hurt a freebird
Could be as obscene as the following 3 words
Suck my dick, know I chose to stop it
Since most of this game is homo-erotic
And I'm straight like S-t-r-i-aight
But I'm STH, when you met me y'all fainted
Came back same day with some lame shit
The same lame shit made me famous
So I ain't never thinking about hitting the pavement
Gave wishes away to people that can't make it
TO the land and other proverbial spaceship
Mother Nature, you late miss
She's ignoring me, okay miss
But I know it's only because you can't wait for a great kiss
Muah!

[Hook]
I don't get it, can you say it again?
Oh that's what you mean, can you say it again?

Can you say it again?
Can you say it again?
Can you say it again?

Same old, same old
I ain't never change, I'm the same old lame-o
Tell me that you ain't know
I ain't never change, I'm the same old lame-o
Tell me that you ain't know

[Outro/Mop-N-Glo]
We have liftoff
It's the people that always ask me whether I know what I'm talking about that piss me off. Dead-ass


I don't wanna talk to you anymore
I'm afraid of what I might say
And I bite my tongue
Everytime you come around
There's blood in my mouth, beats blood
Hand over my heart
Hand over my heart
Hand over my mouth
Hand over my mouth

Hand over my heart
Hand over my heart
Hand over my mouth
Hand over my mouth

I don't wanna talk to you anymore
I'm afraid of what I might say
And I bite my tongue
Everytime you come around
There's blood in my mouth, beats blood on the ground
Blood on the ground
The blood on the ground
The blood on the ground
The blood on the ground

There's blood on the ground

The blood on the ground
The blood on the ground
The blood on the ground
