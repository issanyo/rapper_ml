[Intro]
Charles Hamilton

[Verse 1]
I just logged off the twitter
Finished talking with all my niggas..
Or should I say fans?
Feeling like a B-Boy that couldn't breakdance
I look good in this place, but hey, look, I'm misplaced
The mainstream ain't me but it pays me
May make me crazy like it hates me
But everyday the lady that made me
Says "Baby, take me away from these angry
Apely, rich folk! Get home safely."
She don't care if she dies in the battlefield
She just don't want my mind in the battlefield
But I have a deal so I'm in the battlefield
But my rhymes sorta have a feel....
I'm a Bob Dylan rapper, can't stop killing rappers with my honest, ill rapper skills!
That was real!
I hope this open letter has that certain mass appeal

[Hook]
THE SAMPLE IS HARD AND THESE DRUMS ARE STUPID!!
[Admit that it's dope!]
MY NAME IS CHARLES AND I AM MUSIC!!
[I'm living with hope!]
So since this my very first single
I had to write a message with a jingle!
IT MIGHT NOT COME WITH A DANCE BUT I SWEAR TO WHATEVER I GOTTA COME WITH SOME FANS!!!

[Verse 2]
2-1-6 the birthplace
2-1-2 the 'rise up from dirt' place
7-1-8 is my workplace, working on me
I ask myself, "Is Staten Island lurking on me??"
Maybe
'cause I live in a world with fairies!
My girl is a fairy
Not really but my girl is very..
Very...
My girl is Every
Electric but still very
Many definitions, results may vary
Off days are days Charles takes every last thought that was lost in a hard days belly
Cleans it up
Steams it up
Dreams of stuff
And writes the meanest
Toughest
Genius, public
Scenes of what must be seen!!
Life through my eyes doesn't suck to me
If only the Justice League could fucking see that the public just needs to believe!!!

[Hook]

IT MIGHT NOT COME WITH A DANCE BUT I SWEAR TO WHATEVER I GOTTA COME WITH SOME FANS!!!

[Verse 3]
Could've auditioned for 'Making The Band'
But for the sake of my manhood, I'm better off taking a stand!
And I ain't doing it to have people shaking my hands.Don't be mistaken, I'm never fake with a fan, but damn...
The choices I'm making are just a poison that's taken out of the water supply
Sometimes it gets harder to cry
Charles is the guy talking at night, walking with pride
'Cause often the thought of time without me
Is no other sort of thought than nonsense
"Charles is a fly." I might be the flyer, depends
Do you talk to this guy???
AWKWARD!
No lie
Some are stressed
But some are blessed to see the photo of a sunset
That's just God getting undressed
Are we having fun yet??
It's just a single, the rest of the album ain't done yet
ONE
YES!!!
