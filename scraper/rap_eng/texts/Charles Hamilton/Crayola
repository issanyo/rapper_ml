[Verse 1]
Toe the line with this flow of mine
I got every top 5 clocking in over time
You know what fine? I don't
But let me find out I do
I'm gonna gloat, you know?
My bars can get you laid like soap in jail
But no one knows until they're locked in the cell
Or completely isolated in a bedroom
So high I need a head room, bless you
Excuse moi, but let's move a lot to this exceptional groove
I've been provided to rock
Once again the wishes continue
Fancy was a doom and I'm getting into

[Hook]
Now tell me do you really have fun when you color inside the lines?
Now tell me do you really feel young when you color inside the lines?
Crayola, Crayola, color inside the lines
Crayola, Crayola, color inside the lines

[Verse 2]
I'm Diablo meets Dwayen Martin
I was starting to complain but I started getting brain
And got down, fucked up by high town
Dipset please stop clowning around
Not now, okay? I'm bringing NY back
My city needs a jumper cable and I'm that
I listen to a beat then I black
Think you fooling me, kiss my ass crack
But please don't rape me, I just had to throw that in there
Trust me dogs, I've been there, it isn't fair
Since you're not kissing my ass, get ghost
Abracadabra, watch your ass get toast

[Hook]
Now tell me do you really have fun when you color inside the lines?
Now tell me do you really feel young when you color inside the lines?
Crayola, Crayola, color inside the lines
Crayola, Crayola, color inside the lines

[Verse 3]
Third verse, I say it isn't done
Not till y'all get it is the main event won
Charles is a big alien, son
Dog whistle how I make your bitch cum
Fall in the pit, make a click run
Ball and a whip, Rape the system
Walls get thinner when you play this in the crib
Fun in all innocence makes me get numb
Or unless she's Sasheer Zamata
I had a bad year and have to have a hit pronto
I know, I'm star-chasing again
Just see it as Charles racing to win

[Hook]
Now tell me do you really have fun when you color inside the lines?
Now tell me do you really feel young when you color inside the lines?
Crayola, Crayola, color inside the lines
Crayola, Crayola, color inside the lines
