[Intro]
This shit come on made me laugh
It's Chronic the Hamilton
Halo the Hedgehog
This shit gonna be too funny
Let me see if i can get do in one take
Follow the bounce though

[Verse 1]
Hear the voices in the back of my mind
These fucking voices coming after my mind
All I know is that after I grind
And I grab for my shine, nothing's after my mind
Let that resonate in your brain
I'm dedicated to the game, you never making it rain
So leave the Donna, you, and comic view alone
I promise you I'm harder than Aquatic Ruin Zone
The problem, you should know
How can I separate the game from my name just to let the haters play
Charles Hedgehog-ilton, y'all get lost with him
All bets off, you're dead progress, awesome kid
Don't give a fuck if I go over your head
I'm nasty higher than a blimp, so when I'm sober, you're dead
Move star, two bars, I just screw ya

[Hook]
Think it matters that today is your day
Think I care if it going your way
Cause you don't give a fuck about mine
Cause you don't give a fuck about mine
Think you're important cause you think you know me
My only friend in this world is this beat
And the beat told me
"You want my future"

[Verse 2]
Thank you very much for being my friend
You ain't care for the beginning, but you seeing my end
I know you thinking that you miss my past
But seeing my end means kiss my ass
You giving head like lettuce or something
I guess kissing ass is your fetish or something
Well I don't care, my ass don't have hair
And I'm not a fag, so get your ass from back there
Or I'll shit on you
It's the new D12
A new female and new details
No 646, I'm a 310 killer
Went Hollywood, see the pink chinchilla
My bars are my soul and my beats is realer
The Pink Lavalamp is the recent Thriller, like...

[Hook]
Think it matters that today is your day
Think I care if it going your way
Cause you don't give a fuck about mine
Cause you don't give a fuck about mine
Think you're important cause you think you know me
My only friend in this world is this beat
And the beat told me
"You want my future"
