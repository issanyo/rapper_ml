[Verse 1]
Blunt full of sour, I'm out of orbit and loving
Stunt, since you're louder. I doubt if its more than nothing
Chump or a coward, we bout it you like my cousin
But once you get devoured, the sour's not what you puffin
I do my thing better, you get wetter and jealous
I pass out. You hit several fellas
Now a nigga set up. Spirits saying "get up"
Extra extra. Waiting for the big guess what
A long night. A strong fight. Head blugend with a long pipe
Legend with the wrong guy. Which guy? Tell my witch "try"
The curse makes me slip, so I tell my bitch die
This is blacken. Halo with the bottom line
Shit gets cracking. Laying as I bottle 9
Bitch it happened. Crazy but I gotta die
Waiting for my homicide
Play it if you down to ride

[Verse 2]
Flashback back to back to back that crap
Mad whack. Snack on Apple Jacks snack wraps
Past that, I pass Jack the Chaz cat
Mad whack. But have rap as a snack rap
The ass cat relaxes, using AFLAC
I got your back. Where Lenox Ave at?
We go to Lex and ain't nobody flexion
Ain't nobody question. Ain't a body blessed with exiting
My best friend is reason why I would snipe the fucking president
Did time because I hit a cop
Did my time, then I did a line, hit a dime, in her mind, in her twat
This is my time, nigga dine on a bigger shot
Missle flies by, hit your eye, then hits your block
Grin and grind when it's dinner time. My rock
Jigga, fine. Get your shine. In my prime, I rock
Come on...
