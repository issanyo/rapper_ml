*Welcome Professor*

(Verse 1)
I do not remember having a mouth, but I spit..
I get a lot of "Tacos" like 'WE ABOUT TO GET!'
See a party, 5 minutes, leaving out the bitch like birth!
G.E.D students get my verse
My verses get dissected by Rocket Scientists and kids who hit wet piff!
I write sixteens and still get 8-bit!
Don't even like ad-libs cause I straight spit!
You all anxious
Who you calling ancient???
How old are you to be talking like a Saint, Bitch?!?
I am what's good like 'Ain't Sh1t..'
After a pound or during the same sh1t!!
The S-E-G-A nomad on replay
Mortal Kombat, both systems want me today!
I think I need to lay..
Read a freaking game manual and then choke the game like a Mandible!

Unless I say "WHAT? BROAD!" very cruel
Then she will say "You scare me, FOOL..."
