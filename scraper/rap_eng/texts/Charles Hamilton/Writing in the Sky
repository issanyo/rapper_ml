Intro:
(Sample Plays)
Ima write it, KDivine, shoutout Charles Hamilton "CH"

Writing my name across the sky with a ballpoint
Scammers always approach me but I never fall for it
When I run the train I don't want all aboard
Sometimes wish my ex would call me cuz I'm bored
Dreaming bout beamers taking the dollar cab
Whoever wanna glow I'll give you a lava lamp
Chickens wanna lick me but hey Im not a stamp
I no longer get excited for marijuana plants
I could put you on I'ma genie in disguise
Potential to make it, you can see it in my eyes
Feel like an outcast, just need 3000
You say life is good, I say it's sweet and sour
Ungh it has it's ups and down
Some people serious some people fuck around
Just wanna perform hey I'm coming to ya town
Eventually write my name in this industry
Haters got a voice but it don't get to me
Heaven knows I'm making history
So write it down if you a stoner lighters out
Fuckary on face book when I browse
Getting so impatient want results right now
And I give her good loving when the lights out
Snakes in the grass weren't ready for my lawnmower
Everyday an adventure call me Tom Sawyer
All I gotta say is being handsome is hard
Don't get so upset cuz I danced with ya broad
Iced out Mom think I'm wasting my money
I put up a good fight before you taking it from me
Try me nigga I dare you! I'm not frail
A product of my environment and oxtail!
