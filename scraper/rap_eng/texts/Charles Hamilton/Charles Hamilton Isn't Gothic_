Me losing myself is either sex, or something evil...

I guess I didn't think this whole thing like I told myself to do
I hope it doesn't matter to you but
What they hell is a goth to do?
Hell is a gospel groove
What the hell am I not to do?

Now the things I hear might be a test, so I 'm rapping to the beat. It's just me, my low self-esteem and the fact I'm still standing on my feet. I paint my nails black. So, with my toes, I do the same thing. I know what I know. And the pain means I'm going to grow. Those who are hating can suck my groin and go
That's the only problem with being I'm disrespectful, trying to be a G. But I'm also a gentleman, ladies   frequently see
Unless I don't like to hand my hand to chicks. Recently I found out the true Sonic is Nikki. So she can do what she wants to do with me, as far as I see

My closest friends tell me I'm like Napoleon when I think about going in. So it's them: the people who can change my perception, my perspective. I love them, they're blessings. But please let me wear my UFOs, or let life lessen. Because I've learned all of life's lessons. I question by blessings but I don't question themMy questions are my talent, as you can see from the phlegm
Hopefully I'll get to see them again before the apocalypse of MCs dropping shit to diss me. Now they know my weak spot: I'm not Sonic and that's the creep spot. Under my skin it goes, because niggas know with the sickest flow I give them no Nintendo. But fuck it, they dig it right? Dig it it though I'm still physical

Don't sleep on me. "Please do not crash" I tell the aircraft when I hop on and dash. Shit, no more metaphors for Sonic. I gotta get out of the past. Because I gotta get these spikes get out of my ass. I shouldn't pause you, but that's the white button, I ought to. I'm the white boy of the gang. Three or four, Either way, there's reason to be some more, like B5. All 5 like J5, three times. But that's hilarious! 'B' is '2' if you know your numbers and letters the way you need to. Let me ignore me, get out of this booth and drop a hook that'll have you all rocking with dude. Me. So I do me, nevermind-ing all these highlights that are blinding. I see
