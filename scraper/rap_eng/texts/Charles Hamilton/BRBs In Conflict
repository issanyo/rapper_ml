Alright, so listen. I’m not exactly on the brightest mission. If it’s life I’m living, I’m still in it. Diving in the roots like a ?uest. I kinda want the truth. I suggest when I get it, I get it.

And that would be me, because I live in me, and anyone who rapes me just visits. I hope you’re all ready to listen. Because I’m “all ready ready already!”, ready to get to sipping

Then I get passed “couldn’t” and ask judgement if it’s ass is looking for a nasty gush when getting slashed by a… then I look within. I messed up, and I probably need a book again. Phone book of some chicks I can tap. Selfish, but I need to stop listening to that. Selfishness. Listening to me. But I haven’t loved me, EVER. This is a Christening for me! Someone else’s love is what has me stepping up? (I melted this stuff) When it comes to rapping. You can’t stab the person who’s just rapping for Purpose
