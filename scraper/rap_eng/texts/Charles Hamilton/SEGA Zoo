I'll buy you a car with your name on it. 'Cause you "wanna put your name on it!". I'll fly through the stars with the game on it. 'Cause you wanna spit game to *it*. And make the game get on it. Hey. I'm sorry. It's a dangerous bond. When people say, "Hey! My mom was lookin' up to you and listening to you!" I'm like, "Dang. My mom I be lookin' up to and listening to! So we on!" But we ain't having Parent/Teacher Night. I be embarrassed when the night comes. 'Cause the right one probably is not even carrying the mic the way it needs to be. So *it* passes it to She. Who is She, and what is She to you? Probably your cousin. Or a lover. Nothin', if it's true... And that "nothin'" is basically "we not fuckin'" 'cause facing me means... your budget gotta be... me and you. Two

I love y'all to death
Y'all be lovin' my stress
And I love it when my pets say...
"Charles, come and pet me!"
All of the stress seems fallen to death
'Cause I love it when my pets say...
"Charles, come and pet me!"
"Charles, come and pet me!"
"Charles, come and pet me!"
"Charles, come and pet me!"
I love it when my pets say...
"Charles, come and pet me!"
"Charles, come and pet me!"

I ain't lose my moment in the spotlight. I simply got blinded. And I thought Fame was... not right. So, I don't care about the Top 5. I say "hi" to my Top Guys (in their top hats), and I cock back my PsyGat and say "Hi! I hope you like *that*!" Hi George! Hi Dilla! Hi Jack! Then I climax in a chick who's so bad, that her thighs might crack if I hit it so bad. But a nigga's so rad, I can get an old character, get the digits, throw the blunt, then I hit the old class. Called the clouds. Even higher up. I need to be breathing something higher to get me up. But I don't even believe that I'm breathing. So I'm dying and lying when I say I'm breathing. 'Cause I am tryna nut. And basically, if you're as poetic as I get, my nut comes from my psy stuff. I'M UP

Playing on the congas. Probably the behind of my mama. I like to call her Bahama. She might be a Banana in her pajamas. I hope she don't think I only like her because (of) her punana. Because... the reason why is because she was an honor to even meet. I was being a DJ at an event where people were just meeting me and seeing me scratch for the first time. Now I'm calmer. I gotta be (probably) Dali Lama. Maybe Siddhartha, Baby Gautama. Still won't go any further 'cause these niggas want problems. Then, they don't want problems. I'm not a stuntin' problem. But I'm something of a "problem" when I be robbing niggas of they lyrical skills by saying I'm a calmer. Like I just said. Hating me would be karma. Karma's a bitch. I like her, because I'm ON her
