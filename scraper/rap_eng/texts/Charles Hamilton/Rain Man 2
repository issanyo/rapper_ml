[Verse 1]
You find me offensive
I find you offensive, for being real nosey and minding my business
Hey Em I love this track, do you mind if I flipped it?
Rhyme with some slick shit and shine on these bitches?
Ride for my guys deep inside of the trenches
You better off tryna co-sign with the kid quick
Or catch a hole in your chest, the size of a biscuit
I'm a grown man, no time for the kid shit
Rap Magic Johnson, why do I spit this?
Cause I'm ill but I won't die from the sickness
And I don't hustle, cookin' pies in the kitchen
But don't be surprised if you arrive on my hitlist
Yeah I see yo ass, just vibin' to this shit
My bars got you locked, this a five minute sentence
You feelin' my style, you feelin' my flow
Your girlfriend is with it, you get it so you niggas should know
That

[Hook x2]
You gon' get insane when they put this joint on
I'm stormin' in the game so from this point on
My new name is...Rain man
Stop frontin' man I get the block jumpin'

[Verse 2]
Y'all act like you never seen a pink person before
Till' the first time you see me burst in the door
She hurtin the floor, we workin' the floor
Shorty got a body-adi baby please twerk it some more
But I don't wanna see Tiffany burst in the door
Cause she may leave crazy girls in the four
I'm a straight beast, take me further than your
Average eight, V make me murder you whores, c'mon
Uptown, 125th I been reppin'
The rest of you niggas suck hard, like Karin Stephens
Could give a fuck, what you niggas is spittin'
Cause y'all just writtin' the confessions of a video vixen
Are you kidden me? I'll literally give you the business
The company car, and a big raise
But you gon' use ya sick days, if I pull the switch blade
I'll be in the itch paid, let the shit bang

[Hook x2]
You gon' get insane when they put this joint on
I'm stormin' in the game so from this point on
My new name is...Rain man
Stop frontin' man I get the block jumpin'

[Verse 3]
Now this is the part where the rap breaks down
It get's real intense, no one makes a sound
You amazed at how, I can take your style
Rearrange it wild, and make a crazy sound
I breaks it down, be patient child
Ima give the game back nigga wait awhile
Most of the album was sad, this should make you smile
I OD'd the whole beat, nigga brace yourself, OH!
I'm probably droppin' the hottest product
Ain't nobody caught it so melodic, I'm the topic of your mamas gossip
God I talk alotta shlit-dem-eh-ladala-oochi-walla-walla-um-de-dadada
But you gotta, gotta
Love the way that I supply off the hits bitch
I'm in the game while you ridin' the benches
Fuck you blow me, hate it or love it
That should give you reason to find me offensive

[Hook x4]
You gon' get insane when they put this joint on
I'm stormin' in the game so from this point on
My new name is...Rain man
Stop frontin' man I get the block jumpin'
