[Verse 1]
Smart as a whip but Artistic
All my targets get hit
But yall miss my thoughts
Often i get pissed off harden my fist
Talkin cryptic nah yall all stallin n im quick
Perhaps its the fault of harlem
Or the brick that hit my skull
BUt then i saw it fall n let my mind catch it
So if this is your mind playin tricks with this mind brick
Im San Fran Forty Ninin catch it
Dont whine when it gets intercepted
Your brain cells should feel disrespected
Sitting in the end zone curled up in a ball
The world sucks says the black hole
I call this moment defines me sittin home
My thinkin cap got its stitches blown
Meer thoughts dont fit in my dome
Flushin shit when im finished on a throne
I can't whipe
I use paper to write

[Chorus]
We can all escape to
Loserville Loserville Loserville
We can all be safe in
Loserville Loserville Loserville
Ain't nobody cheating
Were happy for no reason
You can call me Alice in
Loserville Loserville Loserville

[Verse 2]
Panic when im questioned
But a phantom of the exit
Stand at the damaged door
To find that im manically depressed
Familly Obsessed which can be a Pestering blessing
Is why i can't stand to be undressed
The pain was laced with microcameras
Life on campus wasn't quite as hamperin
Life as Hamilton is answering this is Charles callin
Fans in shambles as it cancers me
I cancel the cancer to merge
The tumor with a bottom part of a blumeberg screen
Stress is a part of the brain point game
Whos fault was refrain when Charles came
N said hed be a martar for the game
They gassed n burned him like a fart on a flame
So pardon the shame on my face
I just need a way to escape from this place
But im safe

[Chorus]
We can all escape to
Loserville Loserville Loserville
We can all be safe in
Loserville Loserville Loserville
Ain't nobody cheating
Were happy for no reason
You can call me Alice in
Loserville Loserville Loserville

[Verse 3]
If you lose who plays with you
People who strive to win try to break the rules
You try again so you hate to lose
Haters win regardless
Losers are Retarded
Right?
Like i said im autistic
This beat is retarted you can hear stars glisten
And you can see stars listen
I feed off the nonretards that im winnin
Im the pot belly zombie in thriller
Cause off pot my mind be a killer
Eatin brownies for a body high
Its out of body time
Lay down n watch my body die
Get up dance n body the mic
Break into the crib to hears screams from my wife
We wake up from the dream n she sighs
Cause she knows i got more n she can see it in my eyes

[Chorus]
We can all escape to
Loserville Loserville Loserville
We can all be safe in
Loserville Loserville Loserville
Ain't nobody cheating
Were happy for no reason
You can call me Alice in
Loserville Loserville Loserville
We can all escape to
Loserville Loserville Loserville
We can all be safe in
Loserville Loserville Loserville
Ain't nobody cheating
Were happy for no reason
You can call me Alice in
Loserville Loserville Loserville
