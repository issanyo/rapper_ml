[Verse 1]
Yo, take a minute to relax, lay in the sack
With a lady who you may see as black
White, Caribbean, or Asian
A silly situation
Women make when they stay in your place
Layin' in the sack
With a lady you may see as black, white
You get the picture
Spittin' through the scriptures
Interviewin' niggas
"Did you do what you was sent here to do?"
It's clear if it's true, but it's fear if you lose
Game gear when I cruise, stay here in a blues
You ain't hear me?
Game gear when I cruise, stay here in a blues
Or maybe you'll understand when I appear in the news
For smearin' your crews blood, all over
Like new mud, get watered down and dirty
My shine is too much, cross me and get burned
Ku Klux
But y'all niggas know I'm nothin' to touch
Jack and the bean stalk, I grew up

[Hook]
Truth kills opposition
You lyin' if you say you can see me
You still watch and listen
Without tryin', I just make it look easy
I'm such an expert
(Baby holla atcha man)
I'm such an expert
(Baby holla atcha man)
Don't lie to me

[Verse 2]
Uh, Whoo!
I got you movin' ya head
And if you ain't, then it's okay if I assume that you're dead
I know I said, I'm a loser
But I know you heard the hook
Truth kills opposition
So, no where that I look
Do I see a nigga illa
See, a nigga illa
Cause my fuckin' name starts with a C
A nigga zillin' right now
Cause I'm spittin' rediculous flames
And the action of openin' your eyes
Just invisioning my name
Lame, to even try to aim for my brain
Cause my brain holds everyone in it
I ain't sayin', I'm just sayin'
I love everyone and I meant it
Even those who wished I was finished
Locked with a sentenced
Popped in the fitted
Not gonna stop, till my dick is, about to drop
In need of stitches, never
So just hop, mind your business
Sonic, my team's where the good Sean Kemp is

[Hook]
Truth kills opposition
You lyin' if you say you can see me
You still watch and listen
Without tryin', I just make it look easy
I'm such an expert
(Baby holla atcha man)
I'm such an expert
(Baby holla atcha man)
Don't lie to me

[Verse 3]
Watcin' the U.S. Open, from a UFO
Feelin' all patriotic like Drew Bledsoe
Do let go of the tool let go
Gotta pee
My "Versace hottie" singin' "Ella" rockin' Donna T
Probably not cause "she got her own thing"
Cop a gold ring
Domino's brings a
Couple of pies up in the sky
It's the truth
Why puff on the lye (lie)
When you up in the sky?
Did you forget what we doin' while we doin' this?
I'm too legit, you the shit, even if, you should quit
No time for a stupid bitch parenthesis, (ass nigga)
Or anybody that pretend to be that nigga
Industry ain't been givin me flack
Cuttin' me slack
A sharp minor could make a B flat
And what's in the middle? C
I told you. I am not a little, key
It's me

You gotta play me first, play me first, then play me first
You gotta play me first, play me first, and then play me first
I'm like a piano
You gotta play me first, play me first, then play me first
It's Charles Hamilton
