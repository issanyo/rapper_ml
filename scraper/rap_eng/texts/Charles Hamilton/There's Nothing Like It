[Intro]
Ayo, I don't know if I should say thank you
For that but
Is it image? Or is it skills with words
Yo, the grace jones of hiphop, uh

[Verse 1]
I rap like a condom, fuck with me or nothin Burn to be, permanently, publicly or with cousins
Cyphers get Hiroshima'd, the mic ain't a hero neither
My life is zero when speakers left and right and near the people
Beats by dr.dre voice box It's my choice to stop
Poison the box if a boy is rise,tellem stop tellin devil in a light pink dress shirt
Make her lights blink, my psychy is an expert Saying that I'm wack is not the truth Only one fuckin with me, Dr.Ruth
The rest of you clients are mearly dr.drew My freestyles teach you writers what not to do
My bars imprison you, okay so cop the truth you prostitutes

[Hook]
Hunnid n 10% that's all I do
Hunnid n 10% that's all I do
Hunnid n 10% that's all I do
All I do, All I do That's, that's all I do

[Verse 2]
Sick of being used, now I flip the finger to Anyone bringing ruses to my already evil mood
My flow is butter, milk is tight (I can't believe it's true!)
Afro or fresh cut like beatle juice
That means either lettin pens do the beat down
Or lettin my brain cell fringe do the freak out
It just depends like I can't hold my bowels Candles get doubts when Hamilton spits out the standerds of flowers existing In the land that I sit proud of
Garden of Eden
Retarded when I'm speaking
Forest Gump
All the whores I hump the feelin breathless Low self esteem but rich, call my pockets precious, let's get it

[Hook]
Hunnid n 10% that's all I do
Hunnid n 10% that's all I do
Hunnid n 10% that's all I do
All I do, All I do That's, that's all I do

[Verse 3]
Haters say I fail, so I succeed
Blowin my weed, growin my seed
Show em the scene
Dope as can be, throwing the beat into a coma to dream
Wake up overlyexcited cause it knows I beasted
So conceited, jonesin with the deep in
Like I dove in you before, but I'm so close to the end
Once upon a time was 500 pages ago
I proved Im dope on stage 500 stages ago
I wanted to make a difference on how consumers buy music
Now I make that "Rapper commit suicide!" Music...

It's what it is...

[Hook]
Hunnid n 10% that's all I do
Hunnid n 10% that's all I do
Hun, Hunnid n 10% that's all I do
All I do, All I do That's, that's all I do
