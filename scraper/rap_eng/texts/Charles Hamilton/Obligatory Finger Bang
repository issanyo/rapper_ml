Eenie, meenie, mine-y. Shorty ain't got a little teenie hiney. But she likes to be beside these teenie boppers. Not giving me bop. I need the opera. Gotta rock a lot, 'cause she indeed likes to give top to me, and I'm proper. Pardon me, I'm Gothic. Getting on her knees till I say stop it. Till I play with a Glock. To my fitted. Like, "Stop this!" Boo-yah! Give it to ya! From the back, and I'm ruder. Cuter! And I got The SuperComputer! And I wrote my favorite song Loser! Then Loser pt. 2. Then part 3, with a nigga harder than me. Come guard me! I get down, nigga! Marcus Garvey! Point it out, nigga! See it! Every time I do it, "gotta believe it!" When I spit, I make niggas straight DELETE it

Eenie, meenie, mine-y, MO... NE. Anybody know how I go about my hoe? But she climbed on the top of that mountain, so... I don't know if she needs me like I so guess. And she's so wet. And she's so tight. I don't know how, I don't know why. It's magick! It's magick! She got on top of that Jack dick! I mean, JackShit! I mean (smirks) whatever it's called. Forever it's Charles, and I'm getting better with bars. Come on. I better get a menage with Nicki Minaj... or maybe even Meek Mill. He's still on that freak shit with Drake. Which means he can take dick. Great. Nigga. I offend while I violate. Playing the violins, and I don't like to hate

I don't wanna run a train. I just wanna run your brain. I'm the conductor of Usher. "Muthafucka, shut up!" There's no limit to what I do! No shittin! No kidding! It's just what I do! In love with what I do. ...then pick up, if it's what you do! Then this stuff isn't what is new when these niggas want to come up to this dude. Nigga, I'm oh-so-cool, I might need to cool off with brew. And that's way too cool! Way too CRUEL, if you look at my moves. I ain't no Playskool dude. But you know me from preschool. That's WAY COOL! Lay down when I break rules. I say I'm down, and I stay cool. Hey gal, can you play cool with me? Which means... play in the nude?
