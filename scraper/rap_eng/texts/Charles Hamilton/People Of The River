All those people that you know
All those people that you know
All those people that you know
Floatin in the river are logs I conduct

[Verse 1]
Okay so I'm back in the fact
I had to keep you b*tches on track, I'm a vet
Here's a needle if you cats wanna test
Imprison your soul and cardiac get arrested
I done O.D'd, passed the suggested amount
So I know I'm gonna black in a second
Pass em a message, I laugh at you jesters
You wanna put me on, I laught at the gesture
Put yourself on, come back with a lesson
Then watch me come back with a question
You'll come back and be trashed at the exit
You're wack with the penaten, pass in the septic
Crash with the jeds, bit some talen, some Texas
My talent is restless, Master Websters
I got em sayin 'this n*gga so nice'
It's unforgivable like my n*gga Bovice

[Chorus]
I got a million dollar flow
I got million dollar beats
So I really couldn't care
Bout the way you feel about me
All those people that you know
All those people that you know
All those people that you know
Floatin in the river are logs

[Verse 2]
Flow like a river when I'm gone from the buddington
Hip-hop hit, Chuck can make ya fall in love again
If you don't fall in love, oh well f*ck it then
I love to win, so I hope it ain't a f*ckin sin
Charles Hamilton, I'm deadly with bars
I'll rip em fast, you went slow, you Eddie & Karl
I got porn star hoes like Judy
And they're one call away like Ruby
Who will you be? Where do you be?
Do you come off the top, or go loosely?
I do three, rap-singing doobies
I got a [??] like Bruce Lee
I get on tracks, rippin it up
One take, see how quick for me it was
And if ya didn't understand my punchline
Take ya stupid ass to [??]

[Chorus]
I got a million dollar flow
I got million dollar beats
So I really couldn't care
Bout the way you feel about me
All those people that you know
All those people that you know
All those people that you know
Floatin in the river are logs

[Verse 3]
It's funny how Barbie was pimpin Ken
Now I got more barbies to pimp a kin
They all call me different
But they all on me, who gives a sh*t
I'm blowin that marley, hit the spliff
But I'm like Steve Harvey, you quick to trip
God finished with me? Hardly. Dig this sh*t
Ya'll n*ggas ain't Harbie, you can't connect
So please don't start me, I end this sh*t
It's best not to draw me into sh*t
Just cause I'm all pink ya'll think Charles be soft
Retard, he is the sh*t
Cause I chop ya'll beats into bits
Call me if you need spendin' sh*t
I'm a rockstar baby, you seen this sh*t
I get hungover and fuck like the gene of six free (key)

[Chorus]
I got a million dollar flow
I got million dollar beats
So I really couldn't care
Bout the way you feel about me
All those people that you know
All those people that you know
All those people that you know
Floating in the river are logs
