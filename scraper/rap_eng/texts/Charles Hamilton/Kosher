My baby mama got a problem with my anaconda because I slide inside her and all of a sudden I go bananas. I'm not a fucking binocular, but I can see what's on top of her. Kind of like, it's obvious, but I like to be the rhymer of her orgasms. Which means no more spazzing. Just me laughing at a whore who has an orgasm at the fact I say or when I'm rapping and spazzing. The other or could be the brother next-door. Brother man with a broken hip. No joke in my spit. It's so provoking, it. So dope, bitch! Niggas want to argue with my quotes, I dig it. But this isn't wrote, I was living with niggas who was living with quotes inside their system

I'm a soul rider. But then again I'm a poet, and you already know it. So light the bonfire, and let's get to glowing. But only for a friend of mine

I got blown by a chick who's top was golden, so I'm like Kosher. Overdosage when I get a hug from a nigga whose spit is drugs. So bitches who get up and lifted at my plight when I spit. The mic ain't a witness because this ain't my mic. But my mic is in the atmosphere, it's true. I'm at the atmosphere of fearing me and doom. You got a pen? Then you got a Klonopin to a minus then. I'm like a minor but, then again, when I rhyme I'm on top of my mind and I can never win. Therefore, I'm the victim of a doomer. That's twice in my life, maybe more. Maybe what's in store is what's right for my life, a wife in my life. My wife should be a through-mer, because I'm piping it right

I'm a soul rider. But then again I'm a poet, and you already know it. So light the bonfire, and let's get to glowing. But only for a friend of mine

Now let's roll to the coaster, E-R. You know what is missing? The 'O,' sir. Move a little closer. Let me read your mind and then overdoser is my new phrase for me. Basically, a phrase. See... Please give me your face and knee so I can face the beat. Basically, lay with me. Hold on a minute! You get to black all the time when you rap. Now when I'm in the house I've got to mind all my rapping facts? Ain't that a bitch? But ain't that a fact? You acting like niggas ain't grappling that! I ain't trying to rap in the sack. It's more like a wrap when I rap in a track that's a sack. And the sack is a track when you've got the mind of mine. Therefore, please mind the line

I'm a soul rider. But then again I'm a poet, and you already know it. So light the bonfire, and let's get to glowing. But only for a friend of mine
