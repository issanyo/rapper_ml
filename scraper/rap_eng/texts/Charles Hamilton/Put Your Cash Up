[Verse 1: Show TuFli]
TuFli
Yo I black like I ain't got no got damn sense
That's why always toss out a twenty
I ain't ? muhfucka I'm next
These rap niggas stay wit a penny
Chill wit TuFli 'nother nigga to envy
These hatin niggas is startin to look stressed
Like damn, which rumor should I start up next
And these rap niggas startin to sweat
Are you rapping or you jogging?
You hardly the best
Cuz I heard you spit and I'm hardly impressed
Cuz I'm only 18 but I'm prolly a vet
Pardon my back no respect for these niggas
My radars on ya bitch
Imma target her breast
Lemme chill I'm just talking my shit
This a walk in the park
I might park on ya bitch
Lemme chill I was still talking my shit
And you niggas just fartin

Watch and listen

Man you bout too trippin
It's the world that I live in
Piss in
Off everybody so I off everybody that ain't wit it

Bounce to the bounce
When I get on this hop I pounce
Nigga ouch is what my enemies say
Picture me say, "I quit"
I am the shit for peace sake
But even peace say, "Charles you blackin"
I correct him, "He is Sonic blackin"
Where do you go for all this action?

[Verse 3: Charles Hamilton]
So we rocking and rolling again
You gotta know what we be dropping
The ocean is them
Kinda flow
So if you plotting to hold us within
Some kinda rope to kill us
I hope you know you finished
Peace out keep out
Knots on ya head
I acronym em
Ask about me
Rollin wit the baddest women
That be catching feelings when smash and ditch em
I'm a bad guy that's why I have to seal it
My mouth
You know what I'm about
Wait til I ain't sober
I'm out while I'm rolling an ounce
To get high enough to see the earth reflect me
Flow, drinking my can of Pepsi
Meanwhile, I be the color of ?
Scoring like T.O
I boss like Nino
One fly negro
One high ego
I need no excuse
Who are you?
Nigga too la lu
