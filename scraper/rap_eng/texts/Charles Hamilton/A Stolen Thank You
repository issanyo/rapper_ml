Rape victim. Bothered by the 8 living within. "Stay spittin'..." The greatest if I listen to my within. At my wit's end with getting raped. No pen and paper. Just inspiration from within. Y'all niggas must be as hungry as me, wanting money to be. So I saw you in front of me, while I was running from he. And I believe(d) that the L-O-V-E would be the reason why that "-fella" won't see me. You make it seem easy. "Maybelline" breezy. So scarred, but she right there. No problem

And if you leave me I will go insane
So, I can't leave you, baby. Go insane
C'mon, Simone. Come on home

Pressure on my back from the youth, who have an attitude with the fact I'm clever when I rap. Forever they could get japped. But since I'm coming off the cap with no feather on it, forever I'll say I'm the reason why I vomit. You could NEVER feel my pain. So you could steal, but you won't be stealing rain/reign. So, feel ashamed. My shit is TOO REAL for the acclaim. I simply need to exclaim. (!) Believe it or not, I can make me the reason why they hate me. Which is violating. Like a species of guy who hates me, 'cause I ain't been "waiting for" he

And if you leave me I will go insane
So, I can't leave you, baby. Go insane
C'mon, Simone. Come on home

Take a long trip. A long walk. It's been a long trip. We all talk. Simone, it was phone talk. The greatest phone sex. Oh, wait. I may be mistaken. The lady I'm laying with has a different name. And shit. Accident! I'm waiting for the chick. But damn. It's not an accident when laying in a different Simone. I wish I can dip in your home when your man not around, and then dip in your zone. And then end up being "some tampon you found". I'm standing my ground. It's Hamilton with Sound. I love Sonic and Simone. Sonic and Simone. Sonic and Simone. Planet, get down!
