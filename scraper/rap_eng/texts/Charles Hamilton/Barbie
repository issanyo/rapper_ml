[Verse 1]
She was the benefit of the doubt
She gave it to me often…
Lately I’ve been grooving to her playing me..
AWKWARD!
Conversation was A and B until she would say to me “GET LOST!”
And I would follow instructions
No talking
So I found myself in another ladies’ cave
The walls of her love would never fade away!
But
When the score is not in my favor
I rockabye[Rock a bi] later
Smooth Criminal
Who’s rocking my gators?
Possessive of what’s mine
Suggestive but must I…
Protect what wasn’t mine to accept this???
She was never my girl, she was my Barbie!
Hardly feel retarded being a guy playing with Barbie
‘Cause she’s as real as plastic and as fake as Mattel!
Cop her a Corvette and she will stay for herself
But
Then a Ken who’s just as plastic as her
Could have what he deserves
Then again, she’s what I’m after...

Prolly[Probably] won’t like it when I call you my
BARBIE!

[Verse 2]
She said she wanted to flick hop…
Meaning watch one flick and sneak into whatever flick is hot…
Which is hot!
Sex and IMAX
3-D orgasms, best way to climax!
‘Cause at the end of the film we don’t know the plot
But people 3 rows down got over-hot!
Overhearing her moans and jean zipping
Even hearing licking like “NO, HE DIDN’T?!?”
Yes, I did, girlfriend
CINEMA!!
Charlie LeBeau, I star in what women love!
She knew I had a Malibu and a my size
Tried to shut my game down
I’m like, nice try..
She all tight wishing I was not the right guy
Smirk on her left cheek, a tear in her right eye
BITCH, it ain’t my fault that I’m quite fly!
And didn’t Ken say I was his Sensei???

[Verse 3]
She don’t love me no more because I called her bitch
Okay Miss, I won’t call you bitch
I’ll call you Miss…
‘Cause I miss you…
And you miss drama
Like Ms. Drama, tell the bitch to get honest!
But I missed you with my ready, aim, fire mood
I lay with you knowing full and well I lie to you…..
I stay with you ‘cause I’m more than willing to try with you
But you’re one of a kind
And that’s kinda true……
You’re a Barbie, I’m an Autistic kid
I find beauty in my chicken-scratch penmanship
So if my words appear as bullshiting words, you’re on your period
Marked by a different curve
I assume it’s a question mark on your oh so special heart!
Don’t start with me
Either love me unconditionally
Or tap out and say you’re getting to me…
Uhn
Either way you’re living with me
‘cause you my……
