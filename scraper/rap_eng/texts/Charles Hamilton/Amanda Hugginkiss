I sat down with Prince, eye to eye. Told him my wishes before I die. Now all y'all niggas must be colorblind, or got a G before your I. And I'm dyslexic. Had sex with a Diamond, I respect it. Pause on the bomb sex shit, she's someone's baby mama. I checked the nigga, I checked the bitch, I checked the kid, I checked my lid. Inside of it, sex, you dig? S-C-OR-PION, score again. Can't afford the chick. But she gorgeous and that's all I want to do, watch her ass shake on that pole. What it do?

Let her do her thing, I just let her do her thing
She know what she doing
Let her do her thing, I just let her do her thing
She know what she doing
I'm like do your, do your thing, do your thing, do your thing, girl
Do your, do your thing, girl

I caught her eye while I was walking by. Often high, but not often when I'm with her. I prefer to be HIGH. A G in the the way of the I, an H and an N, little though. Nibbling her little toe. Not trying to get her dough. But all i'm trying to do, walk into the booth and talk. Or could be her boo, as long as I can do what I do. The back of mind, she resides, like all mines. I'm just trying to make us the greatest couple of all time

Let her do her thing, I just let her do her thing
She know what she doing
Let her do her thing, I just let her do her thing
She know what she doing
I'm like do your, do your thing, do your thing, do your thing, girl
Do your, do your thing, girl

C-H, I'm going for 8. O-D, drove the Interstate. Niggas don't know but, anyway, I'm like the gothic Hov. But a gigolo, a low Jigga. Go figure, no nigga getting dough. Because ain't nobody flipping coke, sixes know. If they don't, shit. I'm getting gold like Phelps, so hold my belt. Whipping Scooter's ass while I chewed a classroom of cats who rap. If that's too much I have to have a glass before I die. And kiss my Diamond goodbye

Let her do her thing, I just let her do her thing
