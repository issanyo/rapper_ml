[Verse I]
I'm sorry I'm the shit and you ain't shit
I'm sorry I'm great and you ain't this
I'm sorry I'm nasty and you ain't spit
I'm sorry I killed your track and you ain't spit
I'm sorry I keep dropping that new age shit
I'm sorry you stuck on that 2k shit
I'm sorry you a bird on that blue jay shit
While I be in Toronto with a new age bitch
I'm sorry that you lonely 'cuz your crew ain't shit
And they barely get money, So what do they get?
I'm sorry my lines is something that you ain't get
But I do make sense, Fuck all that Lupe shit
My niggas pullin' up in a blue-grey whip
Girls lose they grip when the dudes say shit
I produce great hits to make 'em move they hips
Your wife don't look better than my Tuesday bitch
LL CH I'm on that Cool J shit, nigga

[Hook]
And I'm not sorry (I'm not sorry)
It's human nature (it's human nature)
And I'm not sorry (I'm not sorry)
I ain't no bitch, don't try to shit on me (it's human nature)

[Verse II]
Should I really give a fuck if my talent overwhelms you?
What can I tell you, My talent overwhelms you
I don't give a hell who finds out shit
I'm dope, See y'all be on that Winehouse shit
And how about this, you ain't 'bout shit
I outgrew you niggas, So fuck your outfit
You better than me, How prick?
I opened up for niggas and they ain't been out since
It's the Dennis The Menace who's spittin' lyrics demented
So if you hear it I meant it, shit'll be clear in a minute
It's my year can you dig it, niggas revering is imminent
This is a mirror for listeners
Look at what you made me, crazy, the '08 Shady, Hate me
I'm a coat hanger to you babies haha
So if you don't believe that I'm nice
Go die somewhere like Scott Peterson's wife
Nigga

[Hook]

[Verse III]
Ayo
I can flush a fuckin' toilet, bang on a locker
Make it a beat, and y'all niggas'll say that it's proper
But I'm a real artist, Picasso nigga
You ain't got real beef, you a taco nigga
Your team is Taco Bell, those are nacho niggas
I bag bitches, you just a Costco nigga
Yo quiero problemo? Gato nigga
Did you not know you got flow, not so nigga
So fuck politicians tryn'a get rid of "nigga"
GA or GER you're still a nigga
Can't kill a nigga or keep a nigga down
That's why cops wanna beat a nigga down
See a nigga frown, delete a nigga sound
But I be speakin' ether people, we should keep nigga around
I'm Barack Obama, the next leader
You more like Hillary
Only in it cuz you used to fuck the ex leader, nigga

[Hook]
