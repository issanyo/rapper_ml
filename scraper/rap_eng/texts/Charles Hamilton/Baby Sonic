(Talking)
Was I like this as a baby?
Was I always like this?
Is that why there's something wrong with me?
I was always like this wasn't I?

[Sample/intro]
Oh yeah life goes on
Long after the thrill of living is gone sayin'
Oh yeah life goes on
Long after the thrill of living is gone they walk on

[Verse 1]
If it isn't rappin how easy I get distracted
The gift is packaged in my lab
Drifting is a different practice
For those that are living backwards
To be moving forward
Thinking that is how you get the passion
Problem is you're forced to stick with sadness
In the madness you feel like a (?)
Cause it's always night time
I fight my right mind
When I write rhymes
I'm blinded, cats that like shine, I like wine
So I got to be drunk if I think I can possibly flunk
With all this class how could I be a punk?
In school before I was a pot-head, a junkie
I was the company of rockers and junkies
Went to black schools, cats rob me and jump me
Now they ass want a spot in my company
And females that hated all plottin' to hump me
What you want b?

[Hook]
So this is what it means to be happy
I said this is what it means to be happy
What does it mean when you're happy? (I dunno)
It just means that you're happy
Cheer up, crack a smile or whatever
Whenever you feel down or whatever
Feel like you did as a child or whatever
And think to yourself wow or whatever

[Verse 2]
Mama made macaroni surprise, Kraft with hot dogs
On the loneliest nights, holding me tight
Cause she knows that I might, go nuts
We were broke but she tried to keep a hold of the lights
As long as she could
As strong as she was she turned every wrong into good
We dreamt of saying so long to the hood
And now I write songs for the hood
124th and Broadway
Across the street from Grant
Fall asleep to damn one train going one way
Mad loud train tracks (?) every Sunday
No funds make happy days transparent
I hope the music makes me a good damn parent
Now I can look ahead to such things
Next time is the song that better luck brings

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
I think people know I used to be a pessimist
A state of mind you'll never get, my thoughts were heaven sent
Far fetched like having a black president
But not really if the truth is what he ever meant
I'm the me from the future
I need what you're used to
To get better my world is more advanced than the set of The Fifth Element
I can't sing but this is relevant
Look in the mirror
And making the shape of you
Whatever you can make it through
Get it for the sake of you
You know, I mean for real you know
You know, I mean for real you know

[Hook]
