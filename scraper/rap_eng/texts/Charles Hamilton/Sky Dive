I knock on your door, trying to put a knock on your wall. Must be the little sip of vodka that I had before I knocked on your door. I actually want to know if you can stop with applause. Hate me, so I can date you. And love me so I can make you say "Rape me." The special kind of gentleman that I am. Never let em down with my sentiments. Never mess around with my women friends.

I hope you made the right choice
Don't play around
This is something I feel
The touch of you is so real
Now, baby, now is the time to figure out
If I am the man of the house
If you're writing what I stand about

I just want to let you know
Exactly how I did it
Ain't no matching how I did it
Ain't got to imagine how
I just want to let you know
