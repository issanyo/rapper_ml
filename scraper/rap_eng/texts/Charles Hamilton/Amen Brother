Tragic accidents happen when I rap in this fashion. Are you laughing? 'Cause I'm kinda nude. But I'm kinda cool. Inside(,) out. Pink polo is my kind of view. Now. Back to Donahue. Meaning the microphone, when I vomit and spew the true shit through music. Had to give it a Pooper Scooper to pick up the lust I just give to the mic. Kinda like a kid, but more hyped. Ungh. And I ain't catch a case. Basically I was a victim of a basket-case knowing I'm a basket case. So it's a case of the basket missing it's face. And the face would be the ball. Who's shooting? Back to why I do music...

I said a prayer before I dozed off, and these niggas must've drove off in a "new" (kinda) Camry [wonders, smiles to self]. Word to Egypt. A new kind of cam. Rih on the sides, like "He's my kind of man!" Please be on the side while I'm in the dollar van. And I ain't tryna diss, but you got a man. But now, back to your man who ain't got a plan. Was I supposed to sleep or just tolerate me being the victim of Sodom and Gomorrah? No Gonorrhea but I'm sure the essence of such would still molest me. You still feel me, or must you still test me? I go back in time. With a jet ski. One ski. These niggas can't mess with me. Unless I got extra feet. Now I got no reason to f'n breathe. I'm underwater

Won't be long before the beat goes off. So as I decide to tell you how I does off, I don't remember nothing. Except some hoe who's clothes comes off. But I'm chillin'
