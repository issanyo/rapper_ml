[Verse 1]
Said I'm too white for blacks
Too black for whites
So it sucked trying to find some clothes to wear
And it wasn't any better when I went to a school
Where you were told what you're supposed to wear
So they all made jokes and I couldn't respond
Because...well, I'm not supposed to swear
He said I was a fag
Lose my mind when they beat my ass
Man, I was poned of fear
The next day in class, I would come in with scabs
And they would all laugh till I was close to tears
So I would stay to myself, play with my belt
But I wish I had a gun and a holster here
And I'd cry out for help
But when you scream inside, really who do you supposedly hear?
So at the school same old, same old
Getting punched and kicked in my nose and ear
And I used to think what if I died
Then remember that they really weren't close to care
So I walked around petrified
Cause I'd just gotten beat with a broken chair
And girls thought I was ugly and gay
Cause I didn't walk around with the dopest gear
One night I got sick of it
Tied a rope around my throat wrapped around a pole
Hoping I would choke from there
But it's like god said, Don't you dare
He told me to listen with open ears
So that's why I wrote this here
For anyone right now who's going through this

[Hook]
So if your self-esteem is low, then put your hands up
And for every single goal you said we can't touch
And for every single how that could withstand us
Say... fuck y'all niggas, I'm moving on

[Verse 2]
I went a good two years in high school
Without the fear of walking round pulvarized
I was actually rather popular
And I didn't fear a lot of people over time
And people listened when I vocalised my opinion
And watched me with open eyes
To top it all off, girls were giving me love
Trust me, I was so surprised
But didn't stop the devil
So when people came up hating, it was no surprise
I had a friend who had a little cousin who said that I hit him
And in turn I closed his eye
So the dude said, I know this guy
Grabbed his dude and said, Let's approach this guy
I mean I was playing rough with the kid
So it wasn't like he was telling a blodface lie
But it wasn't as bad as he made it sound
But fuck it, the story's over mine
So Alex and Eddie pressed me
And together gave me 50 kicks
They were upperclassmen and brolic
So each punch felt like 50 licks
I couldn't fight back, I sprained my ankle
So I walked with a limp like 50 Cent
But from the immediate damage all I had was
A couple of scratches and a blistered lip
Something told me to get my shit
And leave out of that school instantly
And that's what I did, took the 3 to 110th
And got on the 2 to central(?) street
Two goons thought they recognized me
So they rushed me and jumped me
Jumped me relentlessly
They hit harder than Alex and Eddie
And you know what they did to me, left me limping weak
Broken nose, swollen and overgrown
Can't see straight, my vision's weak
And over time the blood from my nose flowed
Under my eyes, making the (?) leak
Looked worse than it really was, pretty much
Every time I blinked, I'd begin to leak
And it was like elementry and middle school again
Classmen snapping consistently
And all the consistency was pissing me
Off so much it could've been the end of me
But it wasn't, I was fortunate
So I wrote this for anyone who's going through this
But it wasn't, I was fortunate
So I wrote this for anyone who's going through this

[Hook]
So if your self-esteem is low, then put your hands up
And for every single goal you said we can't touch
And for every single how that couldn't withstand us
Say... fuck y'all niggas, I'm moving on

Cause like a scab, if y'all keep picking at me
And y'all keep itching at me
And if y'all keep digging at me
One day I might just open up on you
Truly yours, Charles Hamilton
