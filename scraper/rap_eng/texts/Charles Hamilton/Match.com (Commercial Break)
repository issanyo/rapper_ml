All the money and the attention in the world
How old you are
Nothing better than a little puppy love

I need a girl that can keep me in front of her
Make it so it's not that easy to front on her
Only the sky can release me from under her spell
She keeps me between the sheets and comforter
And that's all at first glance
I would put in so much work if all the work can exemplify

Yes it was written, my zipper where the pen is
Ink spitting message all over your kitten
But you still didn't get it bingo
And that's the reason why I'm single

[HOOK]
Girlfriend, tell me you like me, tell me you love me, like you my girlfriend
Tell me you need me, life is too easy cos you my girlfriend
Don't need another you my only lover
But you're not even my, girlfriend
You're not even my, girlfriend

She said "why I got ta invite you to my house?
It's not like I didn't invite you to my mouth. And you know I won't do nothing spiteful but I doubt if we end I will like so I'm out"

Doing more than just eating in the kitchen
Eating in the kitchen, beatin' in the kitchen
You get horny just being in the kitchen

[HOOK]
Girlfriend, tell me you like me, tell me you love me, like you my girlfriend
Tell me you need me, life is too easy cos you my girlfriend
Don't need another you my only lover
But you're not even my, girlfriend
You're not even my, girlfriend

Another story about how another shorty found out how to make another story be a public story

Not enough time for a condom
Magnums don't fit, I'm a monster I promise
But Passion has to be a sponsor
So if you're honest there's no karma
You're gonna hate being my baby momma
Hats off to me for being so raw

[HOOK]
Girlfriend, tell me you like me, tell me you love me, like you my girlfriend
Tell me you need me, life is too easy cos you my girlfriend
Don't need another you my only lover
But you're not even my, girlfriend
You're not even my, girlfriend

Damn...
Woo...
Charles Hamilton...
You know what?
Maybe if I, was a better boyfriend in the past
This song wouldn't make me feel so bad
In the future
Maybe I need to be a better husband
