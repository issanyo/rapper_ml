"I guess you wonder where I've been"
"I guess you wonder where I've been"
"I guess you wonder where I've been"

[Hook]
I've been on my Charles shit
Making music that'd make em say "aw shit" like...
Bada-ba-ba-baaa
Don't even bother talking
"I guess you wonder where I've been"
I've been on my Charles shit
When the bass hit your face, you saying "aw shit" like...
Bada-dada-dada-baa-baba
"I guess you wonder where I've been"

[Verse 1]
Wah gwan mi yute, it's Charles Marley
All gnarly, y'all call me to start parties
I ain't a Democrat, Harlem like The Diplomats
This is crack mixed with black & mild, picture that
In your lungs, breathe in, breathe out
We in the house
D-E-M-E, dig me?
It's the kid of the century
The conveyor belt of the industry
I went from Morningside park in the dark
To waking up in the morning in a Palazzo
Got a bedroom with paintings from Picasso
One cool gato, papo, feeling that? Tato
Watch hoes drop clothes when they spot dough
My pockets got dough, watch them drop slow
HCHO pushing the Navi, nigga drive slow
We ain't from here, pops, and the cops know
[Hook]
I've been on my Charles shit
Making music that'd make em say "aw shit" like...
Bada-ba-ba-baaa
Don't even bother talking
"I guess you wonder where I've been"
I've been on my Charles shit
When the bass hit your face, you saying "aw shit" like...
Bada-dada-dada-baa-baba
"I guess you wonder where I've been"

[Verse 2]
Spitting wild in Record Plant
Getting down, my stomach growls then we out, Mr. Chows
Konichiwa, I'm living loud, this nigga's wild
This is how you go from rags to riches
Mad at bitches, didn't wanna show me no love
Overdosing on drugs, comatosing the rug
Now they wanna get a hug, get a kiss, get a G stack
You bisach, relax, roll a tree sack
He's back from the dead, so many thoughts in the back of my head
So I rap for the passion, couldn't give a crap for the bread
The contract was blacking, but the fact is I said
I do it for the love, it's not surprising
What's paranoid, now I'm smooth like Ronald Isley
The Good Life
Think that I'm cocky? Ah well
I'll do What You Won't Do For Love, Bobby Caldwell, aww well

[Hook]
I've been on my Charles shit
Making music that'd make em say "aw shit" like...
Bada-ba-ba-baaa
Don't even bother talking
"I guess you wonder where I've been"
I've been on my Charles shit
When the bass hit your face, you saying "aw shit" like...
Bada-dada-dada-baa-baba
"I guess you wonder where I've been"

[Verse 3]
The troublemaker on bass, I'm the treble-maker
The hellraiser to you pinheads, the heaven breaker
Even God told Moses to split the sea
Listen please or get fried to a fricassee
This is me, The Real McCoy
Keep it real, you know you gon feel the boy
You still enjoy music that I made two years ago
My kicks are fresh, you gon need new stereos
When I step on tracks like a runner
Got clapped in the summer, now I'm back for her number
Dear Summer, I know you gon miss me
When I make history, you know, you lyin' to piss me
Off, only right I dropped in August
But whenever this shit should drop
It'd be a out of body, your hip for hop, spit so hot, nothing I flip will flop
That hit the spot, like a quicky at six o'clock

[Hook]
I've been on my Charles shit
Making music that'd make em say "aw shit" like...
Bada-ba-ba-baaa
Don't even bother talking
"I guess you wonder where I've been"
I've been on my Charles shit
When the bass hit your face, you saying "aw shit" like...
Bada-dada-dada-baa-baba
"I guess you wonder where I've been"

[Outro]
I've been to...
Nigga, Em flew me out
Flew me out of the leer
I call it the leer, it was a private plane
Yea
My man 3H took me to Nobu
What was the bill?
I think it was what, I think it was over a G
What you know about filet mignon at a Japanese Restaurant, ya dig
I'm out here in Cali, rolling up the Cali
Yea
You already know, Harlem World to fullest
Lenox, 7, 8
And what about the east side
