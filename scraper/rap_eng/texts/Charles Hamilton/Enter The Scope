[Verse 1]
Decided Between Being a Cyber Being and a SuperStar
My Internet Presesnts is Super Hard
Got a SuperBlog Mad Twitter Heads
But Nah I Should be on My Getting Fly Shit Instead
Would Davenport Wanna Grab on the Jacket
Of a Rapper who Has an Orgasm over a Corpse
Would Porter Not Go To Work To Support Her Loser Musician Boyfriend
Be the Whore that Listens if I Wasn't in this Position
Such Answers Come with Massive Duplicity
Has to be Pitched by Me the Duplicative Bastard
Niggas Hustle n Grind in My Name
Nigga Fuck a Hustle I Grind For my Name
So All Hustlers Puts Your Plates Down Now
Cause What I Bake Is Made to Be Safe Around Town
Dont Drop Me Toss Me Like Jazz
Talk to Me Break the Fall Nice Grass
I Hate the Fall I Dont Like White Glass
But Since I Spit Crack the Grass might Like That
In RetroSpect I am a God Send
But to Devil Worshipers Thats a Problem
If Your So Fucking Free Go Watch Them
Good or Bad Bitch I Got Options
Looking for Mad Bad Bitches Like a Dog Pound
Selina Was Killed
Selina Hill You All Fall Down

[Verse 2]
Everyone Has Questions
Im With You Charles
Which is Pretty Hard
Im a Pretty Star
But I Shine in the Dark
The Cities Dark
So By Noon I Guess Im Lookin Pretty Sharp
12:01 is After Noon
I Guess that Means my Shine is Past Noon
Sounds Childish To Those Who Act Grown
But Spell Out Noon N get Your Fuckin Cap Blown
Smart People Got the Caps Lock like Next to A
Want to be Next to Me Ill take Ya Breath Away
It's as Easy as a Jackson 5 Hook
Retire UnTil Inspired Rappers Look Quite Shook
My Crates is Up
Id Hate to Get Fucked to Make a Buck
Unless Im Bustin a Nut Up in Lady Luck
I Heard Women are Men and Men are Woman
God Mustve Gotten Wild Zooted in the Beginning
Either That or He Was Just Getting Twisted
So to All My Niggas Show Me Where Your Tits is
N All You Bitches Sit Down n Zip it
Call me a Virgin I Mind my Fuckin Business
As Long as I Look Down n See Where my Dick is
And When a Bad Chick Open Her Legs to Show me the Elipses
I Get Wicked Eclipse What they Be Missin
Healthy or Wealthy im in the Ideal Position

Im a Get my Mind Right

[Verse 3]
Can't Do Anything Right Says the West Coast
Took a Look at a Map im Like LETS GO
Im a Monster I Can Be On the East
I Snatch Breath From the Best
N I Feast With the Least
Robin Hood Nah
Sonic Good Get it Got it
You Should of Probaly Jot it So its Understood
Im a Movie Give a Fuck about a Groupie
Fall In Love Make Love n this is how you do me
So I Sit Bitches Down n Have a Heart To Heart with em
Subconciously This is How I Start With Her
They Start Talking Crazy Like they Got a Shoppin Cart with Em
Grab Some Bananas Bitch n Try to Get Smart With em
The Nice Guy is once Bitten Twice Shy
The Bug Up My Ass is Cuttin Class Grabbin My Fly
In Other Words Shit is Buggin Me
All Could Of Been Avoided if the Public says they Lovin me
Right?
Sorry I Ain't do the Status Quo
Sorry I Refuse to Star in the Fagget Show
Sorry I Ain't Put No Other Rappers Out After Show
Sorry Famly When I have to Go I Have to Go
As Far as the Men n Woman Shit that I Brought up
Some Bullshit that I Heard when I was Brought up
To Avoid Confusion Stick to this Sentence
Niggas is niggas and bitches is bitches and that's politicaly Correct
