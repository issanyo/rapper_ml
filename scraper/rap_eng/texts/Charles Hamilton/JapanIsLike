[Verse 1: Charles Hamilton]
Nigga Primo had the sound of the city
I was a negro little nemo being around all the people who found me witty
Everyday I would dance
Shake hands with Berry Gordy like say and command
Shaving my glands, back in the land where I was taylors man
And cousin.. I can't love it
Shakespearean but wait here he is making clear with hate makes serious thinkers and apes
Evolution is optional, you gotta grow
Colder than Nagano, nose hold a lots of snow
Only cause I'm my only obstacle shots get thrown where I roam
That way since a snotty nose
Double 3 like pippy, where my stockings go?
Watch it go, flow hot only cause his nostrils hold lots of snow
Was what I jotted dope? I know
Pamela Martha Focker when I sock her nose
My boxers show that I'm dropping dough
Times 2, turn the o to a oo and I'm cocka
So proper, though
Not just any old crap. I really don't rap, I spit biblical facts
If you been zonin' your whole life open your bibles to the Book of Job
And tell me that's not my role
God I'm slow, gimme a track to race on
Pass the bacon, it's on
Lacerating my palms
Have the rain in the storms
Ask for pain and you gone
Graduation was wrong
I had to escape from it all
Which sadly makes me (?)
I was there in spirit though with a beer that was cold
Put on my gear and I go get dressed
I was dreaming about tomorrow screaming out in a sauna
Steaming out all of the sorrow reason is able to doubt, so
Reason can I borrow?
Heathens in the garden only keep me safe from Harlem
Demons are my problems
I have 216
Who wanna wish they were me, ya not listening
In the midst I stay in the midst of mixing
The Jimmy Douglas of spitting the sickest substance
Fix it up and kick you niggas some tough shit
Hit you up and dig a ditch
For your quick interruption of momented bliss
When wishing nothing but the worst
Bitch, this is nothing but a verse
But my unheard thoughts can fuck you up and work ya oven up
That's either being a Mike Ike or being a tight dike
Either way, my life
The day-breaker all I do is spike night
Sorry V, but my heart is on my knees
B-I to the rocker
Those who met me are brave
Can't forget me If I paid you to forget me today
Ride around cold hearted Gretzky in a way
But I got the sweetest shit, I'm nestle in my ways
Stopped eating fast food because I'm not dumb
Relapsed and copped some because I got dumb
I shouldn't shit
You effin' niggas is full of shit
That's word to my temples y'all are good at it
Sacrifices my vices on a wooden brick
I'm pushing' dope music, these niggas pushing' dick
In and out of your ears like "it couldn't fit!"
Everyones a female they screaming' "put it in!"
But no class or gender has my agenda
So I just sit back and be myself
I wasn't casted in the pretender
Packing' in my winter clothes, the same trunk as the lame junk
Summer clothes don't wanna go so they stay funked up
Like my roommate was George Clinton
Making more dinner out of faith and door sinners
The whore is a winner
Gorgeous but her course is a written
Focus, cool, support this here written
Wars in the middle of the core, the big apple is warm with it
I sit back like a chick that has to urinate
Absurd like guys spitting' sperm in your face
Now that's a permanent 8..
