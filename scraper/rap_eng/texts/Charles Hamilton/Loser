I'm not leaving out this motherfuckin both till I get this shit right
Uh [x3]
It's Charles Hamilton

[Verse 1:]
How does it feel to wake up to the feeling
That knowin that I don't give a fuck what u feeling?
I didn't know my life was so appealing
So high that I'm touch the ceiling
Looking down at her with the attitude of Imus
You nappy headed hoes can't find us
I'm just mad at the fact you tryin to blind side us
Lying to yourself like you can ever out shine us
You can lick my nuts while I'm playing Primus
Then wake up tied up to the back of the 5 bus
Why must niggas ever doubt Mr. Hamilton?
Wildin, written, singing, or freestyling
I'm doin the music that you should be zooted to boom
If you could do it man I'm sure you would be doing it too
But this is a gift that was giving to him for christmas
So in the event you think different, dismiss it bitches

[Hook:]
I once was the loser
Now I'm older still the same loser
That's why I look so different to ya
You see the past I see the future
Now my bars is off the chain
Everybody know my name
Ain't no more things around me change
You know who's gone stay the same, gone stay the same

[Verse 2:]
It's all about the Benjamins baby
But I been having different sentiments lately
Do you think these niggas listen when they play me?
Have you heard the bullshit these niggas making?
What's even more bullshit these niggas caking
They think so limited they be givin it 80% of them maybe
But take a nerd that only listen to Shady
Jadakiss and them with a little AZ
James Todd Smith, Nas with a little bit of Jay-Z
Incubus, System and AC/DC
And along with a couple pounds of that he-mi
Maybe you can considerably be me
But I think I made it sound too damn easy
I don't know what you think you doin but it ain't rapping
You hiding behind the mic like Jermaine Jackson
Lights, camera, action, bastard

[Hook]

[Verse 3:]
Yo Kirk pass me the Jesus juice
So I can get deep up in these beats like roots
This isn't a verse, man, this is beat abuse
Tape up the microphone before I leave the booth
I'm a beast in booths, a nightmare in Nike Airs
A nice dream of ice creams the Nike fiend
Rakim rockin light pink
I'll leave Harlem mc's running quick to give em light feet
No A.G. involved, just me involved
Me and my MGM squad, Demevolist, I know you see them dog
Niggas wanna beat us up, they girl beat us off
Married to the game, not no prenup ya'll
Life's a bitch, yeah she a beat-up dog
Quick to wife her, no reason, shorty got her teeth up dog
Before the bitch try to eat up Charles
I throw her a fuckin peanut jar, tell her, "Feast up broad"
You see I got my feet up, doll
Illest rapper that you seen thust far
Fuck ya'll, I'm nice as fuck, ya'll, so fuck em all

[Hook x2]
