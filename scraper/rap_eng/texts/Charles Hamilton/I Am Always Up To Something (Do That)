“I won before I even opened my mouth. So you should already know what that poem’s about.”

[Verse 1]
Sky blue, sky blue, everybody out
Except for me, the one that everybody doubts
Charles Hamilton, the name that everybody shout (Hi!)
The day that I retire, watch everybody pout (waaaaa!)
Swag of a virgin with a daily body count
My dick is like a rumor, been in everybody’s mouth (no homo)
They heard I was comin’ back and got quite shook (shook!)
Shorty’s the dream, she gave me the right hook
Eh! I’m a bad mutha-uh-uh
I hate ya’ll niggas like a mad Uncle Ruckus (Ya’ll niggas!)
So get back, I’m a pimp named slick back
Spit crack, all the chit chat, you will get slapped
Shhh… It’s me on the snares and kicks (It’s a me!)
I got rap pneumonia, so sick! (uhhh!)
I make hits, you don’t make shit (not at all)
Rap is H.S., tag I’m it (whooo)
And…

[Hook]
I ain’t mean to do that
I ain’t mean to do that
I ain’t mean to do that
Yeah…
I ain’t mean to do that
I ain’t mean to do that
I ain’t mean to do that
Uh!
You punched me doe!
I ain’t mean to do that
I ain’t mean to do that
I ain’t mean to do that
I ain’t mean to do that
I ain’t mean to do that

[Verse 2]
Well… doesn’t this beat blow your hide
So it’s no surprise that the coldest guy
Since the hands of the TV and poltergeist
Approached the mic and turned it to a moissanite. (chill!)
I’m drunk on music, no AA meetings
They can wear pink, but they can’t be me
The rap bastard at the back of the poetry class
But blacks on tracks and that’s why I’m showin’ my ass
Ya’ll full of bullshit, rap name is ole (ole!)
I’m cool with the poet Aja cause I’m all about my Monet
Don’t play! Flow is in your nostrils, Flonase!
Life’s a bitch, you’re a bitch, but I don’t go both ways
So fuck you, it’s nothing to burn you
Talk about the stuff that my firm do
I’ll get my cousin to murk you
No fuckin’ commercials, doors are closed
So stay the fuck out like a convo that doesn’t concern youuuuu

[Hook]
It’s an adlib!
I ain’t mean to do that
I ain’t mean to do that
I ain’t mean to do that
She said
I ain’t mean to do that
I ain’t mean to do that
I ain’t mean to do that
Uh!
You punched me doe!
I ain’t mean to do that
I ain’t mean to do that
I ain’t mean to do that
I ain’t mean to do that
I ain’t mean to do that

[Verse 3]
Verse three!!
Right now I’m hip hop’s favorite target
But I’m cooler than a penguin’s armpit
Can’t harm him, can’t be touched
You see me, Scotty, beam me up! (up![Woohoo!])
Cause I’m higher than Storch (wowww)
Looks like I fired a corpse
I’ve debted the past and left the past debted
And I got a fat ass fetish, that’s about it
Gimme some bad credit
I don’t need cash, so set it
Yeah, I said it
I meant it, call me Evil
Or unbelievable, either way
I’m demented
Cause everything I said I meant it
Mint like fresh, you know (fresh!)
So begin to step, cause I’m professional
Yeah, I’m here, just had to let you know
Gone… (It’sa me!)

[Hook]
I ain’t mean to do that
I ain’t mean to do that
I ain’t mean to do that
Yeah…
I ain’t mean to do that
I ain’t mean to do that
I ain’t mean to do that
Uh!
You punched me doe!
I ain’t mean to do that
I ain’t mean to do that
I ain’t mean to do that
I ain’t mean to do that
I ain’t mean to do that
“So how does it feel to walk down the street with someone who plays all these games.”
“Okay…”
“I win!”
