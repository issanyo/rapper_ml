How many ways can I look you in your eyes and not be surprised that it’s not in the Book, King James version. A virgin of King James until we get perverted. Seems strange, alien lust. Waking up, saying it’s enough. Breaking up bud. Going to get a Dutch. Hey, what’s up? The reason I get high is Welcome to Detroit. SEGA started there. All of it is fair. or unfair. Somewhere I’ll get my due when I spit my truth. This I do, married to music. Carrying fluid like GarageBand. I’ll be God damned. This is all for my man, holding my hand. So I sing…

If you want it. Come and get it
If I fronted, you ain’t with it
So if it’s coming, then when is it?
I’ll be satisfied with knowing I can get it

I damn near don’t have a bag for this track. And that should make this a diss trick. Fuck am I busting for, because I carry heat like I’m the over door? The fuck for? Why’d I get drawn in the shit? Coming through with my raw innocence. Not even talking my shit. Just holding onto my balls and my dick. Trying not to cum at the thought of a Six walking in the crib saying Charles is the shit. I ain’t calling it quits. I just need a darling and a fucking Voodoo Doll, that’s it. Wrote it in my head, now off the top I spit

If you want it. Come and get it

To pick up where I left off with this. It’s a coffin for this shit. I hope y’all are coughing. and digging it. Because often I’m not spitting this. Just walking the streets in my awkward outfit. Y’all figured out Charles is about it. I’m about Six, like Eddie Jones. That’s on the West Coast. It’s heavy though, he was a part of the Heat too. LeBron, I don’t need you. I was hot before. The hottest course like Atari. Stop your jaws from dropping. Broads, don’t stop your drawers from dropping. Hop in the whip and get it popping.  My brother drives, so does George. SEGA, I love you more. That’s it, y’all

If you want it. Come and get it
If I fronted, you ain’t with it
So if it’s coming, then when is it?
