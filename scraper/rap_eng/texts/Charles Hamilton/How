I'mma get this shit right this time

[Verse 1]
How you gonna tell me that my life ain't dope
Cause my life ain't right without a mic and a dope beat
I take life, put a knife to her throat
My flow tight though, get it right from the boat
Niggas talking bout they feelings, all the dope that they be selling
But can't get in a cypher with me spitting off the melon
They try to take control, I be like "Fuck it", so I let em
Leave them niggas feeling stupid, they quick to hit the exit
And I'll be damned if a nigga gonna flop life
Get some good top, let a nigga on top
So I beat the bitch wall, leave semen on her jaw
I could find my way and I'm Keenan with the bars
And the ivory, playing the piano man
Ghost name music, I'm the one you channel man
Spitting like a nigga getting lifted, I ain't infident
Dammit man, see me one second and then I'm vanishing
I don't give a damn thing, nothing was given
Life or death, eternity's the other decision
Yeah a nigga gotta eat, so I'm stuck in the kitchen
Just a musician, this is the life
Love it or live it

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
How you gonna see what your eyes won't allow
Going right for the crown, nigga wipe me down
No it ain't a jab, nigga suck my dick
Want beef, throw the hands, nigga rush my shit
I see you niggas wishing I could take a reprise
Hatred for me got me breaking on the greatest of beats
Till the day MTV says I'm the greatest MC
I'mma rake up the leaves of all you dated emcees
Getting head from the hoes used to dating emcees
Got a mouth full of eggs like bacon and cheese
It's breakfast, the kid reckless
That's why I tell them first verse, niggas exit, let's get it
Go ahead, nigga say my name
I want it, you blunted?
Yep, I just stunted
And that's why I'm venom with a little pink
The nerve but...this is what niggas think
Who you?

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Why I gotta listen to you ugly ass niggas?
Getting fucked on tape, you bucky ass niggas
Suffering succotash, you a bunch of suffering, sucker ass
Niggas, butt fucking rap
I'm making love to music, utt fucking rap
Cause she know I'm the future, so she suck a sack
Yeah, talk about sex about sex a lot, cause I sex a lot
Probably stretch your block, mad bitches on it
Like a MySpace comment with mad pictures on it
I already done stressed the box
Admit it you nigga, I'm extra hot
Incoming IM, you accept or not?
I done gripped the game, what's next, the Glock?
If you nodding your head, that means your neck get shot
Call up the Doc
