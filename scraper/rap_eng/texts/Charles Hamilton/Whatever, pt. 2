I am the innocent one, living in fun. Hitting these drums like a stupid victim. Get out the way, snare! Get out the way, kick! I'm riding on the bass. It's basic for me to be this high and in the Matrix, trying to survive from all this gay shit. It fucking sucks! And I ain't really make chips, but I'm stuck in a great situation. Getting bucks, getting laid from a grape chick. I mean a 'grey' chick. Maybe Jean Grae, shit. I ain't have nothing to drink so I know it sucks. All I'm thinking about right now is rolling up. And I might roll up with a bad bitch or two, having mad wishes, but for you. How my bitches want you but not me stumps me

I walk in for the sake of the thrill
And I want all the money that they got to give
I go out getting laid to play it safe in a safe place
And I know and I know that I want to life

I walk in this bitch like, "Sorry, you're a bitch. But I had to walk in. And this party is the shit!" Which bitch? I mean birth, I mean life. I'm hoping it's a mean verse. But they mean write, you know, get your thoughts together. Yo, I could walk the course of life forever without a pen and paper, directing motherfuckers. Some sick-ass, Spike Lee, director motherfucker. Either way, biatch, I know what I got and I know what thee got. And please be hot when it's time to open the twat. Finito! I'm sorry if that's a big boost to my ego. Biz-nitch I run the business. And I fucking love saying bitch. Get this: I hate everybody, but I need love. I love love, but I hate needing love from anybody

I walk in for the sake of the thrill
And I want all the money that they got to give
I go out getting laid to play it safe in a safe place
And I know and I know that I want to life

God damnit, Jack! Stop distracting me! I gotta get on this track and rock it. Minding my business, pass me a sprocket so I can hand it to Spacely like, "I got it!" Disco King, but damnit I'm gothic. I run music, and that's on some Pac shit. When I die, all my lyrics will make sense. Now, back to that rhyme pattern about the Matrix. Take a pill, enjoy life or go back to your life. I'm the boy of life, getting molested by chicks. Getting stressed by these niggas who swear they don't dig my best shit. Whatever. Interception! Either you have to love it or get hit in the midsection. I got the gat to do it. And this track is stupid. Here come the hook, now you have to do it

I walk in for the sake of the thrill
And I want all the money that they got to give
I go out getting laid to play it safe in a safe place
And I know and I know that I want to life
