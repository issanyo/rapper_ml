[Verse 1]
I suck at flirting, I'm worse at monogamy
Can't seem to stick with just one person
What is hurting? I'm far from what is perfect
But I love to love, love is perfect
With that said please don't deny me this moment
It's on layaway and I guess I need to own it
Let me start with how you feelin', I should know your name
Mary Jane, or is it Louis Lane
Attracted to an outcast with powers
Which means I can outlast you for hours
Spend a night, before you leave if you have to shower use my towel, I'll take you shopping, you like American
Eagle? Let's write A-E-I-O-U's like
Vowels, 'cause we wiser than owls
I hate being alone, I'll do whatever to fix it
Pleasure in an instant, you'll never forget it

[Chorus]
Don't you leave me alone for too long
Just give me a sign (just give me a sign)
I don't need to be home anymore
Let's let our love hit the sky (the sky)

[Verse 2]
My dreams are what I chase, I believe in what I make
I love what I do, believe me I can make
Love to anything, passion is my talent
And you are so soft, a passionate ballad
Since I love music and all things beautiful
Imagine what I can do to you
See it's not all about licking, kissing, and touching
But that shit is a different discussion
I should stick to cuddling but I move too fast
And I hate to have to leave your heart with a wound too bad
For repair, I'm the type to say I love you
In the first five minutes knowing I meant it
But that's just my business, I know guys did it
To you so they can just dive in it
So instead of being one in the pack
I sit alone, acknowledged as just someone that raps (deadass)

[Chorus]
Don't you leave me alone for too long
Just give me a sign (just give me a sign)
I don't need to be home anymore
Let's let our love hit the sky (the sky)

[Verse 3]
What's the difference between a broken heart and an
Open heart, guess it depends on the dream
And I guess in essence it's best that you discover
The only difference is one sounds better than the other
My ex left and said I'll never get another
That could love me like her, shit I better get another
Or be left for dead in this bed with empty covers
So I write in the sheets of my notebook
Sleep on the same sheets, I dream what I can't speak
I told you once before to read what my name means
'Free man' but why won't this pain leave
Pain chain me, emotional slavery
Only I can save me, Mary Jane and
Louis Lane please remain sweet
Only unconditional love can save me
So much for thinking I'm crazy, Charles Hamilton

[Chorus]
Don't you leave me alone for too long
Just give me a sign (just give me a sign)
I don't need to be home anymore
Let's let our love hit the sky (the sky)
Don't you leave me alone
