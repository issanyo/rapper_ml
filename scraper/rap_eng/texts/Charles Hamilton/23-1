I tried, motherfucker. Word to my eyes, motherfucker. My Dad said a lie, motherfucker, it becomes the truth. I guess Michael Jackson is coming to dude. Billy Jean, you’re not my lover. Feeling this beat, I’m the top 5, fucker, when it comes to producing. And I’m not talking about shooting kids. I got mutant kids, apparently. They do shit that is scaring me. Back to Michael Jackson, this hotel is heartbreaking. Hard for Jamaicans to bake to the this, if they’re not saying I’m garbation. Love it, then you hate it. public, I fucking made it. Fuck you, if you fucking hate it. Suck my dick

Time to get down. I’m in the house
Diamonds from out of my mouth
Small town, big city. Life’s a big crown
Time to get high as shit
Write shit down, I document it
Trying to find thoughts that are not demented
I need you to compliment it
Not to mention I’m the hottest living

I’ve got a clock coming out of my head. One to the left and one to the right. So I say One on the mic, stop when I’m dead and then clock what is left. Like men, like hustlers, I like them.

Presidentially, dentally, bitches mean everything to me. So go down. Let me win this whole round, ho. Now go around town, find a foe as profound. You’ll end up going down

Action Jackson, die with the bitch. The bitch is white. Second verse, nigga. The worst, nigga. The Worst Nigga. And I’m the worst, nigga. Damn, I repeated it. Something must keep me seated in this bitch. Standing up, like Luda. Like computer, am I man enough? Hamilton does it. Not like Mary, quite scary. But Hamilton loves it
