[Intro]
This, that double dutch music
That, double dutch music
Uh, uh
Double dutch music
Uh, uh...

[Verse 1]
Baby says i want, got me spoiled to begin with
Loyal to her friends, crown royal, is a fitness
I wanna be a witness
Wife her then i live with
Bows to get down, dance around when you get this
We just rocking, we just stoppin
So take a breathe'r then pop it
Back up on that simple flow
Dance floor, light, and digital
Stand more tight than zippers go
Ran off tight, came with this dough
Take a sip of coke and take a picture of the sickest flow


[Chorus]
If you tryna get up, gettin dressed to hit the club
Go
That's so raven
That's so raven
That's so raven
That's so raven
All that money in your wallet, all designers in your closet
That's so raven
That's so raven
That's so raven
That's so raven


[Verse 2]
Verse two time, hurt you with rhymes
Circle around to find a dance partner
Can't start the party with a quick hit
Or just hop out the whip with a biscuit
So playful, still so mean
Still the flow can go and kill the whole team
Silicon dreams, arrogant nightmares
Half of my life explained right there
Stay right there, then go left
Nintendo ain't give no stress
Menace Denise flow is menacing
Mr.Wilson got sick won't get me


[Chorus]
If you tryna get up, gettin dressed to hit the club
Go
That's so raven
That's so raven
That's so raven
That's so raven
All that money in your wallet, all designers in your closet
That's so raven
That's so raven
That's so raven
That's so raven


[Bridge]
If it feels too good to be true well then it ain't(ain't)
Feelin good is new, don't be actin like a saint
Say
Oh Snap
Oh Snap
Oh Snap
Oh Snap
When you move move like the body of snake
Or move like canoes when they riding on a lake
Go
Oh Snap
Oh Snap
Oh Snap
Oh Snap


[Chorus]
If you tryna get up, gettin dressed to hit the club
Go
That's so raven
That's so raven
That's so raven
That's so raven
All that money in your wallet, all designers in your closer
That's so raven
That's so raven
That's so raven
That's so raven
