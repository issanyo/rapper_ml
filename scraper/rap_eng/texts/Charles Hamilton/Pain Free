[Verse 1:] (Kevin Scampoli)
I feel so good with a glass half full
If only I knew where the hourglass stood
The Fleet app brings back our park route
The sands of time expose my roots
My dreams attack but the tears fight back
I thought I was free of this '15 crap
Lean and mean with a need to clean
You'd love the man i'd proven to be
You don't know much, but you blew us up
Powered down, this boy will frown
Trapped in the void of his side of town
Remember my crown? A Gemini loud
I ruled with force and she found my pounds
Final thrusts from a clown in swound
Loud to a crowd, turned off the mound
Now she falls ever south, with brown in her mouth

[Chorus:](Kevin Scampoli)
Pain for me from now on
Pain for me from now on
Pain for me from now on

[Verse 2:](Murph Dirt)
Tell me what you thought when i broke up with you
Tell me what you said after you broke up with me
Would your friends still still swipe right on me?
Cause' I always swipe right on them
Your friends are so damn sexy
Please tell me you talk shit about me
Cause' I only talk shit about you
When I was high, I'm always high

[Chorus 2x's:](Kevin Scampoli) *Dirt's verse plays over hook*
Pain for me from now on
Pain for me from now on
Pain for me from now on
