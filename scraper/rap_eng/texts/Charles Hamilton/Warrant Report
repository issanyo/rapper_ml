Living so official now! My... my whole family say I'm gettin' down! I'm living out of the censorship that I give to my gout! I kick it out...! I kick it to the rhythm while I'm living out the instumental's doubt. The shit WISHING to doubt, as if a nigga didn't have the spittin' clout!

Have you figured out yet (9th) that I have a way to climb inside of thy doubt? Which could end your last name, but it'll be a hit anyway. So don't hit me. If you feel a bit of disrespect, it's just a musical hickey!

All I want is you, girl
Even when I'm
Not
In the mood, girl
All I want is you girl
You could end the world that is the New World Order

Yes, I've gotten quite precise while I listen to beats. Not just from 9th. But I've been going insane. Flowing from the brain to show the membrane of the soul that I'm giving it insanity. Instantly, and with family. Which could be a strike. I listen to the mic, and the mic is silver (Silver), so I'm killing myself at night. Hope you feel me, unless my grandmother's grimey and trying to get behind me. Or under me. Or underneath

And she's who I love the most

I'm not a wannabe

Pardon the lisp, but that's it. Nigga gotta go in. Talk that magic shit. Family love is magic, and love is a force. And love I support

All I want is you, girl
Even when I'm
Not
In the mood, girl
All I want is you girl
You could end the world that is the New World Order
