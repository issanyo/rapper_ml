Yes I might have got a hit in the face for a loss of rights
But that hit led to a hit and I lost a ring
I ain’t even had a ring just a magic ding-a-ling
And I would splash it then I’d bring that bitch to Magic City
And she would strip for me
Magic City being the crib
Making music in the crib she was my B I was Jig G A
S E G A
You can hear the ring but you probably gonna want to F L E A
When it comes to the beats I may be
The modern day hey nobody’s messing with me
Probably A L C healthy
But in F L probably would tell me I probably should stop
While I’m getting popped
My helmet falling
Hell bent on calling the flames of hell to be mine
Instead of Summertime for your boy everyday
Everyday would be Autumn
November and I’m falling in love with you

As I walk across the sun
And I stare across the ocean
As I start a brand a day I ask will life ever be the same

Yes, hello Satan I’m sent from God
With a wallet that probably embodies everything you wish you got
I don’t want your fancy rocks
I don’t even want the people who dare say you fucking rock
When compared to me
But I would like to know the cost of being the boss
Being the guy who can turn on the faucet
Make the fire go down and only throw in the people
Who deserve to be in the fire cause they lost and
Talking down to the dude that’s been down
Who be messing around, who make broads bend down
When he come around you might call me Ben Wallace
Benjamin Grimm with slim wallets
But these slim wallets are Slim Shady wallets
Which means I might as well have like 80 wallets
Damn, so crazy like I’m selling Spacely Sprockets

As I walk across the sun
And I stare across the ocean
As I start a brand a day I ask will life ever be the same

OK so the cross of the fire in hell was undisclosed
But I just want you to know
I will never retire so well
I take the flames put it in the verses
And put it in the meaning of all your curses
Then take the meanings from your curses
And put them in my verses
Then hearses get dispersed for all the haters that which to go versus me
No versus for me
There’s not even a 2-player in Sonic 1 I got a gun
You don’t even want be to the player of whom I’m popping pause
You not Robotnik but dog
You end up with your bots coming after me and they lost
And your bots is fire
That’s me giving Robotnik the sire award
I’m not saying you God but I am on fire and dog
And I would like to stand in the fire in my draws
Probably record the hottest song
Fipping samples like I’m Dominique Dawes
Get off my balls come on
But I’m not even done so why would I say I’m gone
See there’s a reminder when you look at that star
I'm s straight-up start you’re upside-down which is hard
So you can be the goat I’ll be the dude who promotes
You be like the mirror, I’m the dude who boasts
SEGA I hold you close
By the way note

As I walk across the sun
And I stare across the ocean
As I start a brand a day I ask will life ever be the same
