Alright, now I'm feeling the Ciroc
It's The Faculty music
Brick Oven
There's 4 of us in the studio
I ain't got a pen or paper or nothing
What? What?
I'm coming up with the verse right now
Yo!

[Verse]
December 31, '11, someone is reppin'
Gunshots, someone drops, they need heaven
But it's New Years, two beers
New fears, new broads with braziers
And I'm trying to hit, slide in it
Vibe for a bit, then we hit the crib
Couldn't find an eye so then I mind my business
While she getting busy in the whip
But she ain't doing shit, cause I ain't in the whip
I'm on 42nd being fly in this shit
Looking at the ballers, crystal
I see the future, I be the future and we be music
Brick Oven, B.o.B, Faculty nigga, we O.D
Have my money right away, no C.O.D's
Cop my CD if I feel the need to drop one

[Hook]
Charles here a new year, let's see about that
I'm here, you here, let's see about that
I hear you clear, let's see about that
I'm near you there, let's see about that
Are you leaving with him? Let's see about that
That's a glass to the rim, let's see about that
Are you sipping on? Are you sipping on?
Can I have you here? Let's see about that

Charles here a new year, let's see about that
I'm here, you here, let's see about that
I hear you clear, let's see about that
I'm near you there, let's see about that
Are you leaving with him? Let's see about that
That's a glass to the rim, let's see about that
Are you sipping on? Are you sipping on?
Can I have you here? Let's see about that

Charles here a new year, let's see about that
I'm here, you here, let's see about that
I hear you clear, let's see about that

Are you leaving with him? Let's see about that
That's a glass to the rim, let's see about that
Are you sipping on? Are you sipping on?
Can I have you here? Let's see about that

And if all acquaintance be forgot
Let me hear that 40 cal lick a shot like
Blaka, blaka
Blaka, blaka

And if all acquaintances be forgot
Let me hear that 40 cal ring a shot like
Blaka, blaka
Everybody...blaka, blaka
Ring them shots off

Fuck!
