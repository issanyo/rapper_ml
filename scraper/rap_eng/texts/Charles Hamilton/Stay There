[Verse 1]
Work, nigga, work
Field nigga rules
Guess they don't know how a real nigga do
Through the love and the hate I'm still in the groove
I only love Hate, so, for real, who is who?
Kill me or move
I don't chill and when I do
I feel a tooth of some bitch's grill on my tool
And she's getting irritated so now I'm abstinent
Mad pensive, all you haters eat a fat dick
All I care about is Dilla and Madlib
But since that Dilla shit mad niggas is passing
On the nastiness I actually present when I'm rapping
I was trying to get him a check, not disrespect
Ok my nigga Hex and that nigga who's on my dick to death
You really 'bout to slit my neck and really rep
Fuck the world, Sonic is dead
It's Charles Hamilton
Fuck you if you not getting bread
(Yâ€™all heard what I said)

[Chorus]
Everybody got their mouth shut
Damn it stay there, stay there, stay the fuck there
White folks putting the house up
Damn it stay there, stay there, stay the fuck there
I put the North and the South up
Damn it stay there, stay there, stay the fuck there
All you haters put your doubts up
Damn it stay there, stay there, stay the fuck there

[Verse 2]
(Hey Mr. Wilson!)
Mr. Wilson, the menace is back
Satanic minister Rap
For real, it's a wrap
Take your feelings back
I still rap, what I'm the illest at
Fuck a twitter app, we could really scrap, nigga
I hate journalists with illseeds in they ass
Joined the bandwagon of hate, but feeled me in the past
I'm guilty of a crash
Fuck if I'm filthy rich with cash
I should build thee with a [?]
Fuck your crown, I'm in my zone, don't fuck around
It wasn't by luck, I was found
Now I'm above the ground
I ain't dissing you, I'm lifting up your gown
Such a fucking shame to share the same fucking town
Why ask "Why?"
I'm back for the sky
Pissing on the radar you climax to provide
Tried to chat with my high
Pardon my back 'cause I'm tight
Fuck wishing you well; I wish you would die

[Chorus]
Everybody got their mouth shut
Damn it stay there, stay there, stay the fuck there
White folks putting the house up
Damn it stay there, stay there, stay the fuck there
I put the North and the South up
Damn it stay there, stay there, stay the fuck there
All you haters put your doubts up
Damn it stay there, stay there, stay the fuck there

[Verse 3]
Brianna had good pussy, why hit her back?
I got my hit back that night in the sack (Uh huh!)
Shut up management, I'm trying to rap
Y'all act like y'all don't know I would die for this crap
I'm not apologizing to Cole
I'm sodomising his soul
But bottom line is: I was high off of coke
Ignore it, I kinda had to force it; it sucked
MTV asked and I didn't give a fuck
I put the shit out and I didn't get a buck
It wasn't for attention 'cause, shit, I get enough
Fuck you non-Starchasers, y'all haters
Y'all broke and Charles is on a major
See you later
My bitch gets ripped when she's wet like [?] paper
So I will worry 'bout a muhfuckin' blog later
Yes, I'm going Pop
Hey, it's about time
I don't get paid to do Shade 45
The underground niggas make Industry songs
So diss me or get along
My shit is a bomb
Keeping it thorough didn't get me to London
And creeping in my borough didn't get me to someone
So put piff in a sun blunt and let a nigga shine
Give me mine when it's time
Get off my dick, it's dinner time
When I rhyme it's Armageddon and then some
Fuck with me, win some
This is redemption

[Chorus]
Everybody got their mouth shut
Damn it stay there, stay there, stay the fuck there
White folks putting the house up
Damn it stay there, stay there, stay the fuck there
I put the North and the South up
Damn it stay there, stay there, stay the fuck there
All you haters put your doubts up
Damn it stay there, stay there, stay the fuck there
