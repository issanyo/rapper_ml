I created a hell in which I live in
All based on a hell that I was given
So why the hell am I trippin when in my hell
I have fans standin tellin me to give this track all I got
Cause my tracks are just hot, back to the block when its grass that I cop
Then laugh at the thought of disaster and talk about it
And these people listen, sweet position
Which is deeper for me because I speak with percision
But as sweet as the beat because the melody has been twisted
What key is it? A-Minor, so am I
At age 21 it will be history
My fans get the stuggle, with the mussle on my inner muscles
I will still be able to spit enough to get me into trouble
A hot boy, fans keep me cool
If you didn't get the puzzle, then you get a knuckle

(chorus)
Well the fads they come and fads they go
And God I love that rock and roll(x3)
Well the point was fast but it was too blunt to miss
Life handed us a paycheck, we said "We worked harder than this!"

I gotta lot of people sayin that I keep them goin
So I keep goin cause I need to keep me goin
I guess im the engine, the deepest motor
No key to control, just keep an open mind
Dont mind me im zonin im here for a minute
Blastin modest mouse if I die then bury me with it
I carry a difference between being carless and different
So I dont care if you get it cause im sharin it, dig it?
My thoughts are blog entries, crawl across centuries
Spendin time with every fan of mine
And its why I have such devoted listeners
I hope they give a fuck if I should land a knife on cloud 9
Doesnt take much to get me down, so I dont go out
I spend my time sittin around just doin music
How boring is that, my morning is whack
Cause crying and mourning is whack

(chorus)
Well the fads they come and fads they go
And God I love that rock and roll(x3)
Well the point was fast but it was too blunt to miss
Life handed us a paycheck, we said "We worked harder than this!"

If tommorow I lose my fan base
It won't change the acne on my damn face
I will still be ugly to me
But thank god for my fans, they love me for me
Luckily for me I love me for me, I just dont like me
My speed might be faster than lightspeed
But im faster than sound, so you seein sounds
Im boring myself I think I need a sound (ring)
There we go happy again, and the lesson is manic depression has me again
Self esteem is a crack to the polly, crush
So im lookin for a rapper to volley
Im probably a bully but whatever, im vexed to find a rapper
Who I can see as better, to sacrifice in front of my fans
I ain't take his breath away thats just his lung in my hands...damn

(chorus)
Well the fads they come and fads they go
And God I love that rock and roll(x3)
Well the point was fast but it was too blunt to miss
Life handed us a paycheck, we said "We worked harder than this!"
