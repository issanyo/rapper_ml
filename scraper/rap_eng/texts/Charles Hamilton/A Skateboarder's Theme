[Intro]
Stepped into the booth
Yo!

[Verse 1]
Must be nice to live an ugly life
Just be nice to me and you could cut me, right?
Water just be ice till the temperature raises
Administer my lyrical age to hating ministers saying
Mr. Give a little bit of a shit about what you're saying
He's just playing, dog I'm just saying
I go hard like H in the trunk
I hate when they front
I'm straight with a blunt and amazingly fun
What I say over drums
Play with the sun, one raygun spray and you're gone
One good morning to you
You don't life is boring do you, do you?

[Hook]
Tell me where does time go?
When I'm going out
When I'm zoning out
When I'm showing doubt

You don't know where my mind goes
Only I know

So I'm showing out
No one showed me how
And it's going down

[Verse 2]
I could rhyme it to a whole new mental zone
When I rhyme I go so space ghost
But I'm fine, of course you know Halo...
Provided the fly shit I'm rocking to
Hurting the silence, I give...
What you thought I should deliver
The smartest, hoodest nigga with the hardest hooks
Flow is off the books
Menstrual with the pencil
If you windows got no tints, imma go in
You know?

[Hook]
Tell me where does time go?
When I'm going out
When I'm zoning out
When I'm showing doubt

You don't know where my mind goes
Only I know

So I'm showing out
No one showed me how
And it's going down


[Hook]
Tell me where does time go?
When I'm going out
When I'm zoning out
When I'm showing doubt

You don't know where my mind goes
Only I know

So I'm showing out
No one showed me how
And it's going down
