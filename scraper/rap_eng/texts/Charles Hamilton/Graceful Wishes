Eye contact (the first time) should've been the worst time. But, it was the perfect time. I had NOTHIN'. You were the only thing I was up to. How could I greet you with a "fuck you!"? I love you. Much too much to be involved with what's above you. I'd rather be below you, actually knowing you. From the souls. And not your shoes. Is that too deep for you? I already assume I lose... I could've lost you when I lost my sanity. But now, I got an awesome family. And all they do is talk about all the anarchy (that I caused; it was all my loss). I lost the world, lost friends, but I gained you. And it's you I look strange to

8:32 (AM). My words are true, but I just woke up. So it's words I chew. I kiss you... on the lips. I miss you, 'cause I assume the distance that I'm going to employ when I destroy a beat will make you see the boy in me. You made me a man. The CRAZIEST man. Enraged at the land; how could they stand up against? Damn! What is this? The anarchy I felt made me melt when I was inside of you (trying to do what I would do when only thinking about my... boo). She's such a ghost. A parasite. A host. But I love her the most. Whoa. Too much love to gloat about. And this world is (has) MAD stuff that I don't know about

Distance. The dis- is what God meant for us. We are so divine and we sent us up when I was inside gettin' low. I didn't know that your hope was to rise to the sky with your... foe. I fuck you like we're enemies. I love you. You pretend to be with me. But I dig thee. Must be a big mystery. How can I stay close to you and stay droppin' bombs in the vocal booth? I gotta decide. I'm not into the "popular" vibe. I just wanna rhyme. Make music all the time. And you are the dime that I'm trying to get high with. You are my chick. But to call you a chick is lust. And I'm on some different stuff
