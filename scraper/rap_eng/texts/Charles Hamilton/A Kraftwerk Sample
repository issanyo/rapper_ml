Or you dropped a dime, you’re so bad the block and the cops are coming after your ass. Do a private strip tease for me. I’ll be listening and smiling gleefully. In the meantime in the meanwhile easily I get distracted. Because your fat ass gets in the way of vision of killing a nigga cause I ain’t feeling a nigga. Now let’s go

You think I give a fuck if you industry niggas like me? I happened to chill out with Ice T and he happened to chill out with Spike Lee. Front row at the Knick game is so likely. But don’t like me, I don’t want to be a crowd favorite I’d rather be a crowd player. Meaning put your hands in the sky I’ll holler later. Go in the crowd and holler at a chick to swallow my Now and Laters. Pardon me but right now is the flavor, its the Summertime. Meaning yeah I want to rhyme but I don’t have to be so deep save it for Winter. The Evil Microchip, do you remember? Sorry placenta, but you ain’t gotta to be there, for me to be the one being so deep. And she has to declare the nigga from Saint Clair. Don’t make me breathe fair, come on
