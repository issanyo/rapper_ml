[Intro]
Yeah...
Such a beautiful color. Hah...
*whispers beginning of first verse*

[Verse 1]
Let me show what life appears like, when I appear in the light, cause life is kinda light. Hah...
A bright shade to accentuate a nice day
Positivity is the only right way
Like haze on an, “I need to get high” day
Or like days driving by on the highway
You get tired of the stillness
But you're wired from how ill it is, to see your vision drift
Pink velvet waters is what I bathe in
Day out, day in until the day's end
My days end, when I play in pink sheets
With the pink woman who needs me. Breathe deep
Let the pink air around you, surround you, and take you to the place where you found you
Birth
Every second you live
Every second you breathe, is every second you give

[Hook]
Take a look in my eyes, and see what I see...
Take a look inside, and believe what I believe...
So pink is the color of life...
Live forever...
Live forever...
Live forever...

[Verse 2]
5 A.M. on the terrace. Admiring the sky
The pink sky admiring this guy
Why? The morning sky reflects me
Why am I so fly it's unreal. Why am I alive?
To show you pastels is the math, well...
Added up colors. Mixed in with lovers
Most colors... Only cover moods
But the color pink covers you... True
Pink gets on your nerves, it's under your skin
Rub your arms in winter, and it's summer again
Birds hum in the wind. Heard someone pretend
Hence, the seasons. Disbelief is factored in
After sin, there's forgiveness
Feel free to act again
A mere apology and respect
As soon as Mr. Pinky accepts
... Heh. Yes...

[Hook]

[Poem: Aja Monet]
The sun bent its head
On my skin
This morning
I could hear the bones of butterflies creaking in the breeze
The breath of birds heaving into the heart of my ear
My eyes whistled open
The air still smelling of lavender smoke and wet leaves
I turn to you
Staring the lids
Of your jarred pupils
Your face is a naked desert
At dawn
An ancient heaven
At horizon
Your mouth slightly caved open
Like an owling cow
I smile
Blooming
Because somewhere before
I remember this
This silence
You sound of a starving angel
When you sleep
You snore like a wailing forest
My love
I think of you
Like a waking dream
Of your spine's grip melted in the sand dunes of my palm
Last night
Your hands
Sprinkled across my flesh like rainstorms
And I can feel the sun this morning
He is strong and gleaming
Your eyelashes splinter
From the blow of my lips
Rise and shine
