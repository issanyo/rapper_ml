[Intro]
You see as a man
Sometimes it's good to have a female friend
You know a woman that you don't look at with a lustful eye
But with a trustful eye
I've been blessed to have a friend just like that
So this song is for my good friend
You know who you are

[Verse 1]
You see, she was a mutual friend of his
One of his first friends in this new school that he entered in
He thought she was a dime or at least eight and a half
Infatuated with the shape of her ass
So when he first met her he just wanted to bag her, gas her
And be able to beat if ever he asked her
But fell in love with her character
Sarcastically hilarious drafted by laughter
They walked in the rain
Learned about what she feels
She thought she was a slut in heels
Thinking, "I'm ugly and no one wants to love me
Only cause I'm a female would a guy want to fuck me."
He replied, "Trust me any guy would be lucky
To be in your heart, and if not you got me in your heart."
So as they walked in the storm and started a bond
Between two people before she left he promised her
"If your lost...

[Hook]
If you're lost, then you will find me time after time
If you fall, I will catch you I'll be waiting (time after time) time after time
(If you're lost) If you're lost, If you're lost, then you will find me time after time
(If you fall) If you fall, I will catch you I'll be waiting time after time (time after time)
If you're lost...

[Verse 2]
He helped her when she felt down but it was hard to tell now
He was on his way to a melt down
An abundance of tears from dumb shit he hears and experienced through the years
He ended up drinking alcohol, taking pills from out the hall closet
Suddenly he got this call
It was her, needed to talk, he was already buzzing
Started to bleed when he coughed
He was out of character talking to her rather mean
Told her what he was doing She said, "Tell me what's the matter, please"
He started crying the pills were making his hands twitch
And he sobbed with her while blasting Aqueous Transmission
Even though she was scared she made up her mind
That she would stay on the line
He apologized and said, "Thank you"
She said, "Baby, it's fine, as long as you keep safe in your mind
And remember when you're lost...

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
You see, I guess I can stop storytelling and just get to the gist of this shit
From that long walk in the rain to the long talks to not talking often
To being pissed and swearing there is no talking again till the offers of brain
To the thoughts of the pain that we both endured
I know for sure that you and I have grown mature
And our friendship is so secure
I'm happy I didn't bag you
Cause I would never get the chance to have you
As my little sister (hmm) that's several inches bigger
I'm proud of you, you're so intelligent
The opinions of others they're so irrelevant
You can be a CEO, or president
A model, or whatever you want
Just never give up
So yay though we walk through the valley of the shadow of death
We'll step in together, best friends forever Mikita

(Talking over hook)
You see I know we don't see each other often but
Our friendship is ever present
You are my best female friend
I'm here for you if only in spirit
Thanks for everything my dear
The laughs, the tears, everything we shared
This song is our friendship bracelet
Only when I share it
So I guess I'll talk to you later, huh?
