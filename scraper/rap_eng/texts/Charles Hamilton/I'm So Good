(Verse 1)
Oh my god, I’m so cool turn the air down
And I will still ice your grill like a stare down
Take the stairs down, you’re not on my level
Hoes wanna stare now like I’m rockin’ a bezzle, treble
Why you so high?
Did you smoke yet
Ohh yes, I’m the illest, place no bets
Don’t want your money and I don’t gamble
Rap MJ and I got that Game 6 handle
Ain't this sample familiar, yep
Larry this is tough, nobody killed it yet
Except the rookie looking vet
Who dress like he get no nookie but could be good in bed
Take a looky at the bully and the pet
Who got every last one of these pseudo bully’s pets
You’re now looking at 2Pac the rocker
Making NBA Jams like boom-shak-a-laka

(Chorus)
I’m so good right now
I’m so good
I’m the best that ever did it
I’m the best that ever did it
I’m the best that ever did it

(Verse 2)
I’m really sick with my Hello Kitty Fender
Harlem prince with my darling Nicky’s silly temper
Cool demeanor, thanks for the guitar
Are we cool Jenniea? Hope so
But however the boat floats, I don’t know
Either way I’m gonna flow
O no, like Yoko
Chillin’ in my linen (Lennon) while I’m grinin’ from the ceiling
Top of the world ya’ll, not gonna curl ya’ll
I heard ya’ll, pink ain't just for girls ya’ll
Just take a look at the dude with absurd bars
You never heard Charles, then you ignorant, def
I piped the fat lady, bring a new singer
A blues singer, who’s blue?
Not Steve’s aminal, here’s a new clue
Boo hoo, the color of your tears, Sonic
But pink is the color of the year, every year
Is it clear?

(Outro)
I’m so good right now
I’m so good
I’m the best that ever did it
I’m the best that ever did it

I’m so good right now
I’m so good
I’m the best that ever did it
I’m the best that ever did it
I’m the best that ever did it
