Back against the wall. All rhyme patterns call. All rings of Saturn fall into my fist. I hit the beat with the heat from the street. Make it rise up then I lift streets to the void and space that it left. Taking the clef and making it rise. The treble forever is the Devil and I am high as the sun. Blasting from the black lungs. Inhaling smoke, impale and smoke. Niggas ain’t ready for the hell I provoke. What the hell have you (been) smoking, Charles? What has you choking these bars? Absolutely nothing but the raps that I be busting. Half these niggas in concussions when I’m rapping for my cousins and them

It’s a family affair, I’m obliged to be in. Tying to be beneath the cement, like an animal. Shit is flammable. Biting Dre but I ain’t write today. So the first thing that comes to my mind I’ll say. Hopefully that shit will blind thy face. Niggas is hating because I ain’t take time to make this shit a rhyme. I’m just saying what’s on my mind. Suck my penis, I’m a genius. I’m the meanest guy who’s seen the shit, all of it. All-Seeing Eye, I see it all. Trying to be the ball. Nigga, Nike inspired me, dog. Same thing with DMX. Be the best through your situation. So all of the shit I’m saying is basic

Bar- bar- bar... Bar up, nigga

Baptized in Hennessy. Mad surprised at my enemies. They are what I inhaled when the preacher picked me back up from Hell. Sipped it, gave him a kiss on the cheek. Said “You’ll be in Shit’s Creek beneath the cement of me when I’m finished with the beat. Until then, may God bless thee.” Curse and a blessing, that’s such a mess to me. Certainly blessed, but please keep your mess from me. Messaging was gone with instant messenger. The Internet was her, except the word. Except my curves, I’m not a chick. But accept my words
