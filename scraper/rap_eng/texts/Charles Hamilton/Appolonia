You re the most beautiful girl I’ve ever laid eyes on
I’m gonna pretend like nobody ever hurt you
Ready, baby? Let’s

Yes sir, that’s her, but it wasn’t like that back when I met her
(Yup) Yes sir, that’s her, but it wasn’t like that back when I met her
But it wasn’t like that, but it wasn’t like that, but it wasn’t like that back when I met her
But it wasn’t like that, but it wasn’t like that, but it wasn’t like that back when I met her

Yes sir, that’s her. You don’t have my mind but I’m looking at her
Kinda hard for me to walk past her. If I did that I would be a pastor
She’s a rebel girl maybe even a devil girl, but I would never let her twirl her hair thinking about another nigga. Except the other nigga was my brother I love the nigga what the fuck my nigga? Is you touching loving her. You fucking her? You cuffing her? I’ve love to be with her. I’d love to speak to her at least. But you took her to the rain of purple, that’s hope. But I happen to know you are an asshole. And you ain’t treat her right, but my nigga that’s her
She deserves a simple black fur all over her neck in wintertime
Cooking her filet mignon at dinner time, come on

Yes sir, that’s her, but it wasn’t like that back when I met her
(Yup) Yes sir, that’s her, but it wasn’t like that back when I met her
But it wasn’t like that, but it wasn’t like that, but it wasn’t like that back when I met her
But it wasn’t like that, but it wasn’t like that, but it wasn’t like that back when I met her

Lesson, that’s him. You can ask my niggas I was scared to get at him. It was an accident when we was scrapping. I was mad at him cause of what happened. He did some other shit fucking with the government. I simply wanted to fuck a chick then fuck her sister, then fuck a chick who I found missing. She could have been the  link of me kissing destiny, maybe she’s heavenly and I’m sent from hell, but it’s the 70’s and she meant so well. She wanted to be with him wanted to be with me but she would sleep with him
And a brother never fucks his brother’s girl. Unless they stuck in another world. But my nigga she was bad as fuck so mad shit is adding up. I gotta black, so…

Yes sir, that’s her, but it wasn’t like that back when I met her
(Yup) Yes sir, that’s her, but it wasn’t like that back when I met her
But it wasn’t like that, but it wasn’t like that, but it wasn’t like that back when I met her
But it wasn’t like that, but it wasn’t like that, but it wasn’t like that back when I met her

My best friend hurt her, maybe it’s a murder. But thanks to SEGA she’s right back on my Serta mattress, maybe a couch. I ain’t think about blazing her out. I want to hold her. Bring her closer. Yes she changed, but to be honest it’s a sexy change. Left me deranged, questioning myself. A lesson to myself, maybe even a message to myself. But never have I felt such a strong connection. I feel like it’s wrong but a blessing. Cause my long time best friend hurt you but he loved you, I hope (or at least by virtue). So hold my hand and feel a better him. Cause I gotta be a veteran, a letter him
Walk over niggas like pavement. Stay with me and wonder where the day went
