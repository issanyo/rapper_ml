I'm a wallflower like Matchbox 20. But that's in the 90's and that's not funny. So when I go to parties I hardly am sippin' Bacardi to get a bad chick to come and guard me. I mean get off on me. Don't get off me, only if you're on me, watching me at the party. Hardly can I do a hardy-har joke to make you say Charles is all smoke and not liquor. The pot splitter, Big Dipper, meaning it's star high. All times of the night hard drives get bent when I come through with Sixth Sense and sentences. My bad, kid. Just rapping with the sake of magic in the back of my cap [?]. I got mad bars you best to catch them

I only got a dollar to my name, girl
So dance for me, baby
I said dance for me, baby

To the fellas there's no need to get jealous or overzealous. I just represent what's better. And I'm better than veterans when representing what's better. Because that's what's up forever, that's S-E-G-A. Please don't pull the lever unless you trying to  play pinball with Charles. My favorite game, Sonic Spinball. To be honest, I got them lost. And they all coming back to me now. It's kind of like The Faculty in the background. Schooling mad cats on how to rap, wow. And I don't even have rap in my background. So Goth, so real, so true, so Charles. And this beat so H2, so Josh. I go off, these niggas is so posh. Uptown Daft, y'all gotta laugh

I only got a dollar to my name, girl
So dance for me, baby
I said dance for me, baby
Yeah, dance for me, baby
