[Verse 1]
Should of known I was being used
But love is transparent, whats the sense of seeing through?
Feels like I need abuse
Beauty views me as a needle-proof fiend
Addictive, Contagious, A drifter that lives in a maze
Lifted from haze, Picturing days when bitches wouldn't give me a hey
Flippin' the page, to sit with the days I visit to get some inspira-
I'm used to the tion(shun), 2nd nature
Heaven made it so I can't escape the sun
Log on, so I can get my blog on
My truth is lonely cause' I speak the Doggone
I'm a loner, followed by loners
People who get publicly abused then apologize

[Hook]
Sometimes I feel like I am
All Alone, All Alone
Ain't got nobody I can
Call my own, Call my own
No matter where I go I
Call it home, Call it home
And if you feel the same then you ain't
All Alone...Cause' I'm right here

[Verse 2]
He was the Outkast, no friends
No window of escape from his zone-age
He gravitated to the music that I made
He was glad I made it, I befriended him
I don't see myself as a star, I'm the sun
I was scared to melt him from afar
But He was cool, our friendship made him popular in school
Not to be confused, he wrote down his favorite songs of mine
I guess to be strong in mind, his insecurity reflected mine
I respect him, why? The bond is real
Sometimes I think he's on my heels
But nah, he uses my songs to heal
Which makes me strong as steel
Why the FUCK would I need mainstream appeal?

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
The boy said she was too fat
She was too scared to eat in school, Whack
Her father is a lot of broken promises
And her mother's a subject that she don't bother with
Not a virgin, but not proud
After the nigga came, she was knocked down
So she visits my blog to see what I say
The parallels between her life and my day
Wish I could take all of my listeners to space
Where we can hawk loogies, and spit in niggas' faces
Then play with the biggest Sega Genesis
Forget the days we missed, decayed innocence
The game isn't as dope as it looks, its dope
Lookin' for more dopes to get hooked
Before you cross-over
I just hope that you look at the words that I wrote in this book

[Hook]

[Talking]
Somebody hit me on twitter one day and said
That, because all the shit that I been goin' through in public
That I ain't never gonna have no mainstream kinda...whatever
That's the biggest bullshit i've ever heard in my life
I don't know how many times I'm goin to say it
I don't be doin' this shit so I can pop bottles and pour it on models and shit
Even if I have 5 fans, and I save 5 lives
That's what's most important to me
You can't tell me these people don't exist
You can't tell me that, these are f*ckin' celebrities
Disguising themselves as, fans
Just do they can f*ck with my head
I know my music has saved lives
And I know I'm changing the world
You can kiss my ass if you think otherwise
Charles Hamilton, I'm done...Nigga
By the way I ain't never done
Keep on doin' this shit as long as I live
