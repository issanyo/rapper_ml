[Verse 1]
Of all the things I gotta put up with
Look up
It's dude in the sky, I'm on my good luck shit
Yup, only time can tell if my mind can prevail from my mind's little hell
Well let's see, next week I'm still Charles
The week after, yup, see I'm still Charles
Oh, I owe you nothing, I just spelled Ohio
I know you probably think that I got a lot of bitches cause I'm rocking this pink
It'd be a lot worse if I'd of copped me a mink
And I love it that my hair could possibly kink if you comb it
Cause only I own it
It's my crown homie, only I know where my crown is
Put you on notice, you're now rocking with the supernatural poet
You don't like it, then blow it, I'm going

[Chorus]
I gotta be cool
I got to keep my peace of mind (that you know)
I follow the rules, and it's about time you follow mine
I got so much to gain in so little time
So much to gain in so little time
So much to gain in so little time
In so little time

[Verse 2]
Come on and groom me
A nice grip of Simone and my family
And I always have to keep me a Plan B
It means what it means
So it means what I means, real niggas understand me
I love me, hate my life and accept it all
So don't expect anything less from Charles
But only the best of bars and promotion
That's extra hard, so guard on
Like a backward swordsman
Back and forth that's how I rap, I'm more than...
Nice, rice, I could've been seeing green
Bo know homie, I could've been seen the king
Or the queen, whatever, how it be
Is seen whenever you people dream
I'm here, so lonely
Top of the world, you people don't owe me

[Chorus]
I gotta be cool
I got to keep my peace of mind (that you know)
I follow the rules, and it's about time you follow mine
I got so much to gain in so little time
So much to gain in so little time
So much to gain in so little time
In so little time

[Verse 3]
Somebody tell me why I feel this way
When I'm sad
How can I chill this way
I used to get high, sit by, let time drift by then I took a hit of sick la
Ahh, either weed or liars, so jokerish they need some fire to get higher
But I let them sit quiet, burn weed, and look at Rich Pryor
Damn, I'm the king of life, there is none higher
I'm Charles Hamilton, call me sire
My desire is never to lose what I got
Cause I'm hot, red eyes like Cyclops
So that obviously means that my mind's hot
And you already know that this rhyme's hot
Cause I'm looking at the mic, why don't I stop

[Chorus]
I gotta be cool
I got to keep my peace of mind (that you know)
I follow the rules, and it's about time you follow mine
I got so much to gain in so little time
So much to gain in so little time
So much to gain in so little time
In so little time
