[Verse 1]
Yo I humbly tell niggas to kick a bunch of bricks
Tell em come get me run with me or get punched in ya lips
I am done with these illegitimate kids running lip
Cause the umbilical cord I ripped so fuck a snip
If the kids dont fuck with this then I think ima stranger
I ain't a bitch throwin darts im the pink power ranger
Humbly hunt Trini Kimberly im Zack I black I stack my tracks why ask my bad
I annoy the track sneeze bring the poison back please
I enjoy the rap scene you exploited black teens
You niggas bitchin when I rush in the place
So you really see the future when I nut in ya face
Press start dog im stressed too retarted to pause
You can kiss my ass nigga my moon is farther than mars
Still a minor but nigga im the father to yall
Ya momma just called, why the fuck you cockin ya draws?
It's Charles nigga, big balls nigga, Indiana Jones boulders ?? closer
Rookie of the year playing the bench on purpose
Cause nigga if I start it will get you nervous
Nigga fuck ya whip and the shit you swerve in
I leave em pissed easy bitch don't forget your verses
Mr Sick on earth nigga get to workin cause the kid's berserk spittin Hitler's verses
But even Hitler has to chill the fuck out
For real so duck down cause the kid is bugged out
Listen up now,Ilive in uptown
Heaven or Harlem, but I don't get the bus now
S. Hedgy Yes rock steady, I turn bedrock to rubble get head and pop betty
And I don't care ifI'mcursin like ima sailor
Cause I still get more bitches than Teyana Taylor
You got the spotlight nigga gimme that shine
I'm David Goliath size here's a piggyback ride
If you wanna talk silly, that's fine
Take my silly black belt on your silly backside
1 lash 2 lash fuck it here's 5 lashes
Look in my eye bastard and take these eyelashes
I'm laughin' , damn he's sick
You cock suckers is funny like Andy Dick
But

[Hook]
I can't rap manI'mjust a musician x2
ButI'min a great fuckin position
What the public's been missin
A pink cussin musician

[Verse 2]
Dissin' me is the wrong mistake to make
Don't do that, ddt nigga Jake the snake
The harlem earthquake can't escape the shake
Ima point blank pistol, face to face, great
Cause you should know damnit ima monster
Me and you is like a UFO landin' on a tonka
The human bomb not anansi kamikaze
Try to stop me? you need more than 106 to try and rock see
I'm not as cocky as I used to be
I just got way too big for a booster seat
So if this dude should eat, this dude being me
Ima go back in time and give bruce lee a beat
Kick that shit

[Hook]
I can't rap manI'mjust a musician x2
ButI'min a great fuckin position
What the public's been missin
