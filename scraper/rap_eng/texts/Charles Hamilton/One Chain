Completely unrelated, these two things I’m about to tell y’all… Some bitch just texted me, AFTER she disrespected me a little while ago. And, I said a prayer… I said a prayer to God. I asked him to accept my darkness, because I’m not his enemy

Late one night at a “friend’s” house. Voices saying, “Get out!” Spirits saying “Get down”. One side of my soul saying, “He’s a friend.” The other side saying “He’s a friend NOW, only ‘cause about 6 thou.” Not talking cash. Talkin’ bout ME losing power out the ass. Power outages. And I’m about to laugh, because sour is the reason why I’m doubting this… A mountain, miss. What you gotta move. My doubt in this is the newest obstacle. How could I lose a friend who was truly a buddy, but only for the music? So musically, he didn’t love me. Yeah. My assumptions. My music. My drum kits. My power. My usage of my power. Am I a coward ‘cause I didn’t do shit? What would you do in this position? C’mon…

YOU DON’T LOVE ME NOW
YOU AIN’T LOVE ME THEN
BUT I’LL STILL KEEP ON SAYIN’
YOU WILL NEVER FORGET MY NAME

YOU DON’T LOVE ME NOW
YOU AIN’T LOVE ME THEN
BUT IF THEM MILLIONS KEEP ON RAINING
DON’T YOU EVER TOUCH MY CHAIN!

MOTHERFUCKER!!!

I assumed it was a nightmare. Not really sure if I should lay *right there*. Yeah. We all see it in your third eye and the diamond that resides in the back of your mind. Call it a memory. But there was no Hennessey. No drunken stupor. All I know is I was drunk on music. One computer. The other on rest. Screensaver went away. All black, I guess. But, we in a world where darkness reigns. And apparently, I have the darkest name. And all the pain didn’t matter. If you can get higher on the ladder, then go ahead. Cause laughter. As soon as the incident ended, my innocence was ended. And this friendship… could stay fake. I’ll be a day late. Because when it’s my time to reign, you in a lake, nigga

YOU DON’T LOVE ME NOW
YOU AIN’T LOVE ME THEN
BUT I’LL STILL KEEP ON SAYIN’
YOU WILL NEVER FORGET MY NAME
YOU DON’T LOVE ME NOW
YOU AIN’T LOVE ME THEN
BUT IF THEM MILLIONS KEEP ON RAINING
DON’T YOU EVER TOUCH MY CHAIN!

MOTHERFUCKER!!!

Of course I gave him pounds. Of course I gave him a hug. Introduced him to my mama, for the second time around. But, as a thug, was it the drugs? Was it the fact when you get the blood of a GOD, you become much more than them niggas who claimin’ they Odd? The Future is grim. And right now, I don’t feel like using my skin. I feel like carving in the flesh of a nigga who say they next. I’m the reason why these niggas is now execs! Loud ass niggas. Throw ‘em all a *check*! Throw ‘em all under a bridge! No Peppers. No! No! No! Nobody gon’ be better! But oh! Whoa! Homo is what you get accused of when you rape a nigga. So, it’s new love! It could be a pound. Could be a warning. Could be a threat. All I know is I was good in the morning. BUT…

YOU DON’T LOVE ME NOW
YOU AIN’T LOVE ME THEN
BUT I’LL STILL KEEP ON SAYIN’
YOU WILL NEVER FORGET MY NAME

YOU DON’T LOVE ME NOW
YOU AIN’T LOVE ME THEN
BUT IF THEM MILLIONS KEEP ON RAINING
DON’T YOU EVER TOUCH MY CHAIN!
