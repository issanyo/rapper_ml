[Intro]

[Hook]

‘Cause it could get, ILLLLLL, Famtana!

Sayin’…

CHIIIIL, Famtana!
CHIIIIL, Famtana!

We goin’ in, goin’ in-in, goin’ in again
Goin’ in, goin’ in-in, goin’ in again

YEP!

[Verse 1]
I have no swag, I have characteristics;
Most of you characters miss it
…
Like character select, from a distance
In the game? These n1gga can’t kick sh1t
…
Like Tekken
Or Marvel vs. Capcom
Pounds to my n1gga for reppin’
But y’all ain’t my brethren
Matter fact, y’all should just keep steppin’, before you get the “FINISH HIM!” and a Fatality
All these rappers, all say they battle me
What’s your name? Where do you work?
Your store CLOSED. N1gga, you’re a jerk
You’ve been shut down
Throw it in the bag
Brown paper? I don’t even have to be around haters
Give dap to one dude, ‘cause his music is cool
Other [than] that?
You music fools, already lose

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Every rapper who has ever dissed me? Is broke
So I got broke, just to give them n1ggas hope
(WHOO-HOO!)
Then I ended up in they’ chicken’s throat
…
Now I’m ridin’ in they’ chicken’s cope

Oops. I meant coupe
But put the “C” in front of oops?
And I’m still right

I’M THE TRUTH!

Baby powder all in the booth…
N1gga, I’m white, just like my “roots“

Call me powder
…
My roots could be white, ‘cause I got dandruff, and I refuse to shower

I keep it funky…

(Ooh-ooh! Ooh-ooh! Ooh! Ooh!)
(“You hear the beat sayin’ “Ooh”?)

…
The f*ckin’ BEAT had to sniff me
Now I’m feelin’ comfy
So
One of y’all wanna diss me, it’s only because you’re broke, and your b*tch just finished humpin’ me

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
The morning I woke up, and realized I was attractive?
…
Man, I did some backflips
Then did a front flip, and got it crackin’
Like, “DAAAM, Shorty, are we shaggin’?”
Unfortunately, I am just braggin’
I was lookin’ at a commercial for Volkswagen
You know how they be havin’ them white folks askin’ if…
Passenger see, the drive is your passion?
Well, drivers are wanted
And I be ridin' with drivers who are blunted
So high, and the island is feelin' like I reside in my stomach;
Because, I ain't got nothin' on it

Now ponder upon it
For just one moment, and realize I vomit
(THIS BEAT… IS LIQUOR.)
But since most cats vomit…
… How ‘bout I straight up, BOMB it
(Let’s go…)

[Outro]
CHARLES HAMILTON!
... For the president, OF the president…

I’m tryin’ to run the n1ggas, who run the people, of which I entertain..
How ABOUT IIIIT…

HahaHA!
Uh-oh!
