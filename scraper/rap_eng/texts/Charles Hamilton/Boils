I allow words to take control. Then I take their soul. Rape them cold. Away they go, knowing they stay in my mind. Frozen. Playing in time. Golden. Like a grave of mine when I'm open to say the rhymes to have you focused on the poetry that I locust. Biblically speaking, my lyrics are creepy. Niggas don't need me, so they go back to their old emcees with they Kodaks. Nice 'fros. Nice chains. Nice whips. Like it all, but my brain is the shit. I pay attention in the midst of it all. And in the myst of it all, I'm mixing it PROPER

I'm connected to a higher power. Like Jay. When he was referring to Con Edison back in the day. But only people who NYC could pay, understand. Run it again. Let it play, everyday, in your yesterday. Which is your memory. Hope you remember me. I'm standing right by you (bayou) like Hennessy. I need a little ice in my Hennessy. Ice in the bayou won't remember thee. Because it's too hot.

The day before. But say I'm Raw
