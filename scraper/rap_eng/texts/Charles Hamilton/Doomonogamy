Got a girl out in Jersey. She going to Toronto. Call my girl from Chicago. She comin/cumming pronto. Meanwhile, I'm sitting here like "I know. This is fucked up and I prayed for them both but... who got those condo-Ms? 'Cause I go in and I don't win, unless I go in and I go "Hmmmmmmmm." (That's an H with mad extra Ms) When I just explode and refuse to let go of emotions of which I let know are... truly there. But... do you care? Or rather, do I care when you *walk off* like the snare? Shit. You walk off and the air of me being a deceiver walks behind you. And you walk behind *it*, saying, "I dare you to try to be grimey to the one who finds you to be cute!" Holy shit. I know it's wrong. I know I need to quit. But no. Shit.I can't be faithful. I can't be faithful

I'm like every last Drake hook. I like every last broad on my Facebook. Scroll down on my Droid. Asking every broad to go down on your boy. Let go of your draws... but now, to deploy my missile. Every girl I ever messed with, I really miss you. Get your tissue. Instrumental, take a breath. Because they take my breath away and refuse to rest. Shake what's left of me when I nutted inside while hittin' it from behind. The recipe for your inner intuition. You understand, but then you listen. Then, you don't understand. So, pretend to listen. Or, just ignore me in this orgy within my heart. And then, I start to pretend as if I was always your friend. Shit. I can't be faithful. Not at all. Can't be faithful

Making you cry is how I die
Making you cry is how I die
Making you cry is how I die
Making you cry is how I die
But I can't lie, I like to die
But I can't lie, I like to die
But I can't lie, I like to die
But I can't lie, I like to...

Making you cry is how I die
Making you cry is how I die
Making you cry is how I die
Making you cry is how I die
But I can't lie, I like to die
But I can't lie, I like to die
But I can't lie, I like to die
But I can't lie, I like to...
