I wanna make sure you understand this very clearly
No more questions

(Verse 1)
I'm sure you're sick of me, puttin' you off
You climb on top, but I'm pushing you off
Look at you, lost
And it hurts for me not to show you the perfect me
No anniversary, barely even a word from me
But word to me, I hold you closer than you think
And hopefully you think you've been engrossed within the pink
And no, it couldn't be a relationship
More like a friendship, but with a sacred twist
I sampled your love, I can make it flip
Time is love making, today we kiss
Why wait to kiss?
If time is of the essence, then I'm on the cover
Subscribe to your lover
Read all about it, he's all about it
Love put up a wall, but we crawled around it
No time to be a man that's possessive
I want you
So just answer the question
Yes or no?

(Chorus)
I don't know much about anything
So I'm just gonna say yes
To whatever I'm supposed to
(Say Yes)
To find out what I'm close to
(Say Yes)
To show you what I'm exposed to
(Say Yes)
Cause I already know(no) you
(Say Yes) (You already know)
Cause I already know(no) you
(Say Yes) (You already know)
Cause I already know(no) you

(Verse 2)
What more can you ask for?
Love T.K.O
I gotta glass jaw
You ask me, to tell you what I have for, you
True feelings and that's all
Is it real or imagination
Ask Charles
God damn, what the hell you think I rap for?
I just want you to open your mind
Look at the color, think of me
I hope you don't mind
That I took a little time
To make your mind the same as mine
I, can take my time, but why just wait in line?
I can be what you need right now
Like how, I made you like this song
You listen with the lights down
And the candles lit
Well, baby, Let me be your pink candle stick
You're my fallen angel
Los Angeles
I'm Charles Hamilton
So can you handle it?
Yes or no?

(Chorus)
I don't know much about anything
So I'm just gonna say yes
To whatever I'm supposed to
(Say Yes)
To find out what I'm close to
(Say Yes)
To show you what I'm exposed to
(Say Yes)
Cause I already know(no) you
(Say Yes)
Cause I already know(no) you
(Say Yes)
Cause I already know(no) you

(Verse 3)
I ain't gotta lie to you
Just wanna fly to you
Show you how I do
When, I do you
I do you, better than circumstance
Consequence
The perfect man
But far from human
Far from Cupid
Far from logical
Far from stupid
Apart from music
We start to do this, melody
That I can't play on the piano too heavenly
Gotta pick up the harp, to pick up your heart
Zip up your mouth, no need to talk
Be my K.K. I'm Ray J
When I say, "Zip your lips," I'm your YKK
Why stay late?
Do it right now
Mr. Right Now
Get your right now
Dim the lights down
Envision my sound
This is my style
We livin' life now
So...

(Chorus)
I don't know much about anything
So I'm just gonna say yes
To whatever I'm supposed to
(Say Yes)
To find out what I'm close to
(Say Yes)
To show you what I'm exposed to
(Say Yes)
Cause I already know(no) you
(Say Yes)
Cause I already know(no) you
(Say Yes)
Cause I already know(no) you

(Outro)
All you gotta do is say "yes"
Don't deny what you feel under your dress, baby
Let me undress, baby

All you gotta do is say "yes"
Don't deny what you feel under your dress, baby
(Let me undress, baby)
(Let me undress, baby)
(Let me undress, baby)
It's kinda hard to undress a star...
(Let me undress, baby)
(Let me undress, baby)
Too bright for light, too fly for wings...
(Baby)
So beautiful
Say yes...
I'm yours..
Charles Hamilton
