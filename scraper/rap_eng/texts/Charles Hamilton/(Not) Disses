[Intro]
Ladies and gentlemen wherever you are
No matter who you are
Like me, love me, hate me
Put your pinky finger in the sky
Yeah yeah, whatever put your pinky finger in the sky
It's funny cause for me getting in the studio is kinda like Waking up and taking a piss (I see y'all)
Especially with the bathroom like right next to the booth
You know
You get used to this life man (You get used to it!)
You don't get used to the bullshit niggas be giving (What' s that?)
It's alright though (What?)
Since the hate is real the response is real
Probably realer than the nigga's hating

[Verse 1]
Niggas mad they ain't got the same mind as me
Then they get stole on like the Shinin' beat
I don't care, solitaire
I'm the king
Fuck a suit can't call a spade a diamond (eesh)
I'm with peace
As long as y'all niggas out
So I peace niggas out
Y'all getting out
Either your boss or my drawls is in yo mouth
No Keith just the sweat from my balls you're spitting out
See the sweat
When I dumb it down I still spit shit you wouldn't get
Wanna bet?
Watch this
I got better aim than a 911 cockpit
Y'all shocked at my Gothic wit
I'm smiling imagine when I get pissed
Wouldn't it be cool if I could kiss the sky and the sky stays a sky?
Instead I get

[Hook]
Kisses
And you don't love me
You ain't my homie
Homie
I don't want no kisses
If you don't love me
You can't even blow me

[Verse 2]
Haters
It's what's for dinner
Warm up to me now or have a fucked up winter
That's word to Storm and Ice Man
Professor Charles X gets warned about a fight and Morningside Heights will be the new home of Iceland
Let me chill I'm just exhibiting skill
When I grow up I wanna be a farmer
I come before it all like armor
No car, I'm just rude like a car search
Shorty said go deep I go farther
I'm nice on a crash like Barker
Before inside sweets there's starch first
I Chris Rock when I drop this Mars verse
And I Chris Rock a bitch swinging hard jerk
But when it's all said and done I'm and
You had to say my name in the middle
Damn

[Hook]
Kisses
And you don't love me
You ain't my homie
Homie
I don't want no kisses
If you don't love me
You can't even blow me
