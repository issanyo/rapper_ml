[Intro]
Uh, let's go

[Hook]
Clowns are all that I know
They like to put on a nice show
But when it's all over I ain't playing around
But when it's all over I ain't playing around

[Verse 1]
This verse ain't gonna write itself
Just gotta remember I'm nice as hell, higher than the lights in hell
Only time could tell if when I die would I get my kinda trail, try to sell
I'm writin' for a legacy, been everyone else instead of me
From the home of Alpo, but of a different pedigree
When I speak in jest, I need to inject
Hard to breathe from my chest, respect should never leave
I bet it be deep, or it never be free
The high is so incredible to me
I play the game of losing life, my two options:
I kick the habit, waiting for a new option, you got it
Loved ones say I'm too gothic, they think it's a new topic
Boo, stop it, these dudes be mobbin
And I'm the one that gets slapped on the wrist, that's some shit
Let me get a pack and a clip like click click

[Hook]x2
Clowns are all that I know
They like to put on a nice show
But when it's all over I ain't playing around
But when it's all over I ain't playing around

[Verse 2]
Sour to the brain makes the cypher complete
Don't try to get high with me, I use the fire to speak
I happened to be what most are trying to be
Fighting sleep and I ain't G-O-D, why? Because he doesn't know me
I've been walking a steady path to hell
I ask myself if Satan is ready for a challenge
I use him as balance, after the fire nothing else is on my palette
I don't want no one in my palette
If I should die, let it be from an overdose
After my first grammy, so my death won't hurt granny
I choke when I flow, never a toke in my flow
So many typos in what I wrote, I don't know if it's dope
Fuck street smarts, I know music theory
So go ahead and turn it up as if you can't hear me
I acknowledge the power of magic, and i use it clearly
Fear is moving near me, I am more en-fearing

[Hook]x2
Clowns are all that I know
They like to put on a nice show
But when it's all over I ain't playing around
But when it's all over I ain't playing around

[Interlude]
It's magic, It's magic, It's magic, magic, magic
It's magic, it's magic, it's magic, magic, magic

[Hook]x2
Clowns are all that I know
They like to put on a nice show
But when it's all over I ain't playing around
But when it's all over I ain't playing around
