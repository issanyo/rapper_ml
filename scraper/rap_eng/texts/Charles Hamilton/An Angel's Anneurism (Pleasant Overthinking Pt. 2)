[Intro]
Charles Hamilton!

[Verse 1]
Thinking out loud, laying on a cloud
There's only 10 clouds (right?), and one of which you're not allowed
Who can stop me now?
Watching the ground from a place called now
Even as an old poster, you can't take Charles down
If this was a bicycle sale (buy sickle cell), shop around
Find a cure for whatever sickness you wish was not a-round
Or does sickness only love richness?
I guess a bugged sentence from me is the degree of a bugged chemist
Too bad I never went to school for my gifts
The role of a king. The tools of a prince
Flow of a sink. I move with a twist
Clothes mostly pink. Shoes that can fit
That's all I need to be seen by the naked eye
ALL of me can be seen as forsaken time
Cuz I have waited. Been Violated
Even before the finer days find a way to become MY days

[Hook]
Anytime I'm sittin alone, I simply get in the zone, no need to pick up the phone and get to driftin
When nobody's around, I just listen to sound, think of verbs and nouns and put it in a sentence
When I get in the mood, this the thing that I do, and I give it to you just so you can listen
And I won't stop for a minute
And I won't stop for a minute

[Verse 2]
Too verbose, I suppose
Close to the throne, but given less hope when alone
When I get letters from fans that say my shit helps them get better
It makes me deal with this shit better
Memories creeping in to the present time
Going through hell, paying for a check that Heaven signed that bounced
I submitted a song to God but couldn't tell her what the record was behind the bounce
Told her "Relax. I can find it out."
She didn't like my tone. It was time to get out
Well God, I'm sorry. I found it
It's called "Always". By a group named "All Days"
So It wasn't a fluke. I really love you
You might think it's life. It's really us two
I don't know what's left to say
Why don't I let the hook be the collection plate?

[Hook]
Anytime I'm sittin alone, I simply get in the zone, no need to pick up the phone and get to driftin
When nobody's around, I just listen to sound, think of verbs and nouns and put it in a sentence
When I get in the mood, this the thing that I do, and I give it to you just so you can listen
And I won't stop for a minute
And I won't stop for a minute

[Verse 3]
It's like when Jay said "I jack, I rob, I sin"
I'm an iMac. iPod. 3rdGen
Cuz I rap like I got iGin
The digital liquor that I share with my friends
My bad. I rock. Nice chin
Well I'm Jab. I box. Tyson
Try jabs. I block. I win
I'm Zab. Why not? Fight him
Cuz I black. I'm hot. I'm sick
I tried crack, tried pot, it's quite grim
But life has my spot right in the sky
That's why God asked men to be nice cats
Guys, stop lyin
I fight class. Might not, might win
But my might is why the liars are frightened
The terror alert has been heightened
For those that say they don't like him
I enjoy what I do. It's like probiking
I would still be this driven with no stipend
In touch with my own spirits. Ill ghostwriting


So fast I broke lightning with no writing. Started writing, paper now won't go by him
