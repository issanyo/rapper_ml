[Verse 1]
Hcho picked me up with a stripper in the whip
And Filet Mignon, and a zipper on her lips
Cause she don't say shit when a nigga wanna spit
Cause the stripper is prison life, I'm tipping on the bitch
Tip-toeing, ready? Let's get going
The kid go in and never quit going
The Energizer hedgehog, pink flip-flowing
Think this moment is a metaphor? Yep
Cause y'all niggas ain't write a better bar yet
Life's a bitch and I get her all wet
Met her at a bar, she ain't get my balls yet
Cash in the front pocket, she might get my wallet
Make her hit a high note, I will never falsetto!
Forget about it

C-H-A-R-L-E-S
H-A-M-I-L-T-O-N

And my bars are as heavy as a T-O-N
Give you the blues like Eric Clap T-O-N
Your boy Al stay Sharp like... (T-O-N)
But ain't nobody hard like

C-H-A-R-L-E-S
H-A-M-I-L-T-O-N

[Verse 2]
Bingo, bango, Boom!, motherfucker
This beat got beef, meet your DOOM motherfucker
MF, zoom motherfucker
Off the radar like two undercovers
Under covers, fucking on the job
Puffing on the chron
The female cop still sucking on his knob
Motherfuckers, do your job
And niggas said that I was the cuffer on the block
I guess so, cause I fuck with the paper
I too fly boy, I might be fucking your neighbor
And you love her, that's disgusting behavior
I'm independent, but I still get love from the majors
Columbus Clippers, the Ohio Yankees
50 loves me, 5-O hates me
Why don't you thank me, I'm retarded
My rhymes are nonsense
Niggas wanna disrespect the boss
They can use Head and Shoulders
And get they neck cut off, suggestion dog:
Pester Charles and Hcho or your breath get lost
You're fucking dead, fetch death you dog
And guess who won't get arrested...
Yep, you done guessed it
You hear my name in your head, It's... OH!
Nigga you heard what I said, It's...
