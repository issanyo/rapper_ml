[Verse 1]
I’m cooler than Charles Hamilton top that
Call me Charles Hamilton with a top hat
CHX, I'm hotter than a cop mad
I got dap soon as I thought I just jot that
I go up so when you go in you go nuts
So crack a cigar, like close but(t)
You outta know, Alanis but I'm more set (Alanis Morissette)
Awkward, a corset to a war vet
And I ain't even go on tour yet
Leave your head spinning, lyrical vortex
Syphilis sores with my spiritual raw sex
Sicker than shore, take a dip in the river when It pours
I got skin In my pores, a tattoo a bad move finish It for me
Permanent, I Mastered It while learning It
Your all living In a mad mans???

[Hook]
It ain't hard to be an asshole, But, I rap so, What’s Up..
You can't get enough
That’s what I hear in the air
You can't get enough
Therefore, Imma be a brick wall no Graffiti at all
Imma be a brick wall no Graffiti at all


[Verse 2]
Niggas is saggin', I face lifted ancient
And tell the other generation to be patient
They been waitin' but what they gone say when
I tell them how and why jealous men play them
Looks for a reaction, OK then
Charlotte Hornet Playing with Anthony Mason
Eastern Conference, The left ones marching
Cause what I write Is pre-destined from the art
I'm the simple son like Bart
Intense, like one mic from the start
But I know, Where’s the Swag?
One question that's really unfair to ask
I get tight like, how dare you ask
You yellow belly fags got canary Swag
In all reality I barely get mad
The Urban Search engine I share the facts


[Hook]
It ain't hard to be an asshole, But, I rap so, What’s Up..
You can't get enough
That’s what I hear in the air
You can't get enough
Therefore, Imma be a brick wall no Graffiti at all
Imma be a brick wall no Graffiti at all


[Verse 3]
Do you believe or do you be in a lie
Alleviate what you receive and believe when you die
Die to believe, to being the believer inside
Feeding lies to the to the evil eyes peeping at my pupil
Do you believe what you receive, then I relieve
I besiege these so please say that you agree..
And pass that I'm a bad cat
The reason cops get that mad, I'm the black Badge-errr
Of all riches niggas after
Raid the tomb, and escape the womb
Sooner or later you will face your doom
Stay in your room and embrace the groove (and stay tuned)

Yeah, it's me, Checki-Charles Hamilton
