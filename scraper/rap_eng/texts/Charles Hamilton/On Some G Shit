I murder a rhyme, one word at a time
You never heard of a mind as perverted as mine
You better, return with a 9 and stir up a crime
I'm clever burnin' with lines, I'm a third of a kind
First Pac, then Em, Then my turn in the line
I'm a young version of a Howard Stern in his prime
Take some deep shit, then let it stir in your mind
On some G shit, can't nobody take my spot
I'm the deepest, that's why I can't wait to drop
For any reason, if you think I ain't that hot
I say ish bitch, honestly I can't be stopped
We can battle for respect, In a vacant lot
Or we can battle for your check, folk, chain and watch
Listen, spittin' hard shit, gets exhaustin'
So niggas ice blew me till they get a crossed it
You carrying dead weight, like you liftin' coffins
I piss you off with, the shit I'm talkin'
I'm quick to cough it, like this piff I'm sparkin'
And if you think you sick in the booth, then step up
Cause I'll break you off down to your roots, like QuestLove, get it?
Then Black Thought, no time for back talk
I'll crack y'all glass jaw, leave you on the asphalt
That's Charles, grab Paul, stack tall, blast off
Cats talkin' use a flame like survivor cast offs
So strange, was most lames with gold chains
Get a deal spend it on gold rings, and rope chains
A bunch of no names, but all these niggas got they head in the clouds
Guess you could call it soul-plane, heh
You can only see yourself, I bet you nigga
You wouldn't believe yourself, you're not a gangsta
You're more like Fantasia, the truth is you got a baby mama
You ain't free yourself, listen
You a slave to a page in my rhyme book
You give me shade, then you may get your mind shook
My niggas pump haze, E, weight and diesel
We can get it for cheap, like fake Adidas
You give 'em a sample they flip, then cop three
If You, give me a sample, I'll flip a hot beat
Nah, I don't need an instrumental
Cause I'm nice wax on, or wax off, like Mr. Miyagi
Biatch please, go ahead shine away
You'll really be a bad boy, when I take your shine away
So undalay, and if shit gets too reckless
I'll pop up on your window, like an instant message
Shit, 40 cal used the Miyagi line
So I'll just stick to screamin' on niggas, like Bobby Knight
See you roll with a gang of birds, like Diplomat tour
But you never see em' bust, like Cinemax porn
My word is hot, my pen is on trail right now
Cause I murder ink, like Irv and Ja
And a lot of niggas wanna get rich or die tryin'
'Till the drama come, then they get bitched, and try dying
And there's nothin' you can say that can stop me
Cause you the type to get caught
Snitch on your team, like Jason Giambi
You think cause I stay to myself
That niggas lame, like a spinna chain
Cause you playin' yourself
And, I don't need an Eight on my belt
A 38 on my shelf, I be that nigga with a blade on my belt
You can't trust niggas nowadays
Cause like Paul Wall
When they get tight, they start sittin' sideways
And I don't trust old niggas, believe me they will get it
Like Mike Jones, even back then, they was still trippin'
So I write my ILL writtens, knowin' that my real niggas
Will hit em', Still Smith and Wesson
Guaranteed to Will Smith 'em
Turn him into a Man In Black
The Man is back, nigga's can't handle that
You see, I do what it does with this musical stuff
I can play keys, make beats, AND I rap
Lyrically, I done killed a lot of guys
If you even dream of beating me, better wake up, and apologize
Won't stop till I blow up, my name will ring bells
From the Apollo to Russia, like Rocky Balboa
On Some G Shit
