I want to be a star. Not a celebrity. Not a wannabe. So, nod your head with me. If it's not a problem, let me see all hands to the sky. At least with telepathy. Ecstacy, every time I hear me speak. Except, I have not been selected to speak by thee. Interestingly enough, I have to be giving a fuck without giving up. Once you give up, you give a fuck about what you gave up. Correct or not? I've never made a mistake. But I'm not Correct. I'm Hot. I'm not wrong. Please don't get the plot wrong...

My hunt might require a blunt, but I am higher than *months* when guys are trying to be sire just 'cause *they* stunt. I wonder if what they want is the number one spot of hundreds of cunts dripping at the sight (site) of them (sega.com). Listen, or the plight of them. I'm exciting them, just by not writing again. They all mad 'cause I'm showing it. And I'm flowing it. So profound when I'm goin' in. What am I showing? The cuts that I'm showing (zounds). This is for the Gangstas and Goths. Making it hot on "The Block". They('re) takin' their stops, just to hear what I got. Forsaken or not. But it's cursed. "But it's heavy!" Lovely verse. Love the verse. I'm giving it to y'all. The rhythm is for y'all. Y'all niggas is listening to Charles

Enough motion. No more bluffs. I feel like I'm cutting the ocean, to see that salty stuff. Snorting it up. High as fuck. Then I sneeze it. Winter, breezing. (or , ) In the season of a nigga who's speaking. My season is forever. I believe I can get it together. And so can all of you, if you follow me. Soaking in all of you, properly. With your ears. Listen here. My shit is clear. Then sincere. When you hear, is it fear that you give to me when you say my shit is weak? If you say it... If you play it... If you even know I exist. Stop playing
