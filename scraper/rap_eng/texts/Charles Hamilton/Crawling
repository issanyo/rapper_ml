[Verse 1]
I am the ace of rap, there is none higher
Fuck Charles Hamilton, call me sire
I am not hot, boy, call me fire
Matter fact fuck that, call me Pryor
I live then I spit it, don't call me liar
Put the pedal to the metal, burning all 3 tires
Last one safe cause this is a good year
Y'all niggas want the truth, y'all nigaas should look here
Team Captain, mascot, back with mean rapping
Olajuwon if I get on, he's blacking
The beat's crack so I'mma rock it, Steve back it
2000, you wyling, you need practice
Hakuna Matata, my music is proper
I do what I gotta with the music so you dudes is just nada
Spit crack, your iPod moving my product
Another level from the devil, ain't no use for the Prada

[Hook]
Show me what it's for
Make me understand it
Show me what's it for

Never give up
Never give in
Never surrender

Show me what it's for
Make me understand it
I've been crawling in the dark
Looking for the answer

[Verse 2]
People wanna know about the bitches I've fucked
Dignified sluts
In church every Sunday but licking my nuts
Monday through Saturday lift they thighs up
Get a nice nut then I zip my fly up
But I ain't dumb enough to be getting tied up
These hoes need a reason to hit my wife up
Grip my life up, can't they think?
They man ain't thinking, they ain't living like us
Claiming they feel some but they chill
When they get exposed on tape by St.Bill
Little Charles Hamiltons painted they grill
Cubans or corny hoes, they just ain't real
Your girl is a permanent freak, got sperm on her cheek
Rub burns on her knees
Ask her why, she like...

I've been crawling in the dark, looking for the answer

[Hook]
Show me what it's for
Make me understand it
Show me what's it for

Never give up
Never give in
Never surrender

Show me what it's for
Make me understand it
I've been crawling in the dark
Looking for the answer

[Verse 3]
I came for the throne
My name will be known
I hate being told either maybe or no
The game's getting old
I'm making it over
Bring pain to your dome like Razor Ramon
Lady Luck is a slut, got brain from the ho
Came in her throat, told the dame to go home
Rap Johnny Storm with the flames that I throw
Don't sit there looking like you ain't really know
Addicting sentences, cocaine in the flow
Listen, too much if for your brain or your nose
My music, I use it, Rick James with the flow
Smacking y'all Murphy's with the same little joke
What did the five finger's say to the face?
Fuck that, what did the Hamilton say to the bass?
Smack!
I got them dumb vexed, if you just not y'all
The future's in my balls and I ain't come yet so...

[Hook]
Show me what it's for
Make me understand it
Show me what's it for

Show me what it's for
Make me understand it
Show me what's it for

Show me what it's for
Make me understand it
I've been crawling in the dark
