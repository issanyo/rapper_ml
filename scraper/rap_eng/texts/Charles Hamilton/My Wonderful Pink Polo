[Verse 1]
Another day lost, Another day as Charles
Another day across the stars (Heh)
I keep my mind in the clouds, I'm an Alien
Hope they won't be finding me out
The beat is so crazy I don't know what to rhyme about
But it's better than you niggas rhyming about nothing
What's all the gossip about?
Nobody fucking with me- God doesn't count
So what's there to be modest about when I know I rule the world
You inside of my house
If you die then you out, God got it from there
So what happens to you after I don't honestly care
See my hairs made of wool get a lock of my hair
Im mysteriously cute, women stop just to stare
And as hard as they try not to get snared in the beartrap
I glare back, you probably scared

[Hook]
They say "he going crazy and we seen this before"
But I'm doing pretty good as far as geniuses go
And I'm doing pretty hood in my pink polo
Doing-doing pretty hood in my pink polo
They say "he going crazy and we seen this before"
But I'm doing pretty good as far as geniuses go
And I'm doing pretty hood in my pink polo
Do-Doing pretty hood in my pink polo
Doing pretty hood in my pink polo
Do-Doing pretty hood in my pink polo
They say "he going crazy and we seen this before" (Find your dreams come true)
But I'm doing pretty hood in my pink polo
..in my pink polo
..in my pink polo
..in my pink polo
Check it out

[Verse 2]
Never ran from a fight I lost and came back
The game is like a fight, got lost and came back
So I laugh at niggas that done lost their chain
And act like lost their brain; They O.G. bought their chain back
Meanwhile I got my pink polo on
The pink polo so you can be polo'd on, Get it?
Throw some D's and rosaries, air out like potpourri and hopefully
You can get close to me and notice me
For the extraterrestrial being, you know who I be
That's bad English but fuck your english
This broken English, bad enough to speak it
Good enough to throw it up but bad enough to keep it
My world is strange, No fucking secret
Make summer music in winter, I love the seasons
No effect for the cause, just the reasons
I'm just the reason You are just a reason
Love is a trend that you love to demon
Fucking angels, making love to demons
I've been honest since The Chronic get it popping with no option
Try to stop my runner, Knuckle up; Sonic and Robotnik
Father time hate my guts I must be adopted
Mother nature hates his guts, it's fine she let him pop it
Nine months later here I come on a rocket
Now I'm grown, the show's dead 'til I come on and rock it
I give life to you dead ass niggas
You don't get, I give life to you
Dead ass niggas
Life is misunderstood I'll blast from this
Anything else would be blasphemous
I'm a fucking human being with an asterisk
After this, Try to find yourself an ass to kiss
Your Lazarus...Welcome back
