(Intro)
Uh. Uh

(Mumbles)
Never spit the same bar twice twice
Never hit the same broad twice twice
Uh
Never spit the same bar twice twice
Never hit the same broad twice

Alright
Haha
Y'all don't even know what that was...

(Verse 1)
Hi, I'm Charles and God I'm so cool
Always get in trouble I don't follow no rules
I got a easy pass, so I gotta go through
However you want it, I got it so choose
Girls walking up like, "I gotta know you"
Niggas walkin up like, "I can flow too"
The funny thing is that a lot of those dudes
Use to be a prick, now I don't know you
I'm so cute that, I'm hideous man
I'm the truth, it's ridiculous man
I don't really know a lot of niggas that can
Do what I do, that nigga I am dyslexic
White girls love me I'm playing them off
Only Clarissa be explaining it all
They all fell in love with the Sat(t)elite song
Now I'm climbing up the ladder lights on
Gotta em screaming out

(Chorus)
Na, naaaa, na, na, na... na, na, na, na, na
Why you stop? keep singing... ALRIGHT ALRIGHT!
Na, naaaa, na, na, na... na, na, na, na, na
My first name Charles and my last name Hamilton
And I'm so...
(WAY COOL!)

Verse 2:
Janae said back in Queens
The reason her and Dorian would act so mean
Was they thought u was boogey that's OD
I guess that's the reason I rap so free
I wasn't being boogey I was being me
It wasn't my fault that they wasn't seeing me
But me being gifted came easily
I guess being different, is the key to me
But recently I been flying
Right in the thunder kick drum snares made out of lightening
Rain drop high hats, storming on my track
Hurricane Hamilton, Earthquake HcHo
Call the weather channel up, assuring that they know
I spit nothing but pure made llello
So these mermaids that I wanted to sip
In third grade, but I heard they gay
So they both told me

(Chorus)
Na, naaaa, na, na, na... na, na, na, na, na
So I told them I'm a rapper... ALRIGHT ALRIGHT!
Na, naaaa, na, na, na... (I made the beat too) na, na, na, na, na
Cause my name Charles Hamilton
And I'm so cool goddammit I'm...
(WAY COOL!)

(Verse 3)
Never spit the same bar twice, twice
Never hit the same bar twice, twice
Never hit the same broad twice
If you hit the same broad, hit the same broad twice that night
If you hit the same broad then the same broad let ya man hit then the same broad likes me and the same broad that you met when you hit the same broad twice
I'm saying yall can hit the same broad... twice
If you don't like the new me I'll bring the old me in
But don't say nothing when I'm OD'n
If yall niggas is balling then I'm Kobe then
And I do it for the kids, Nickelodeon
See girls don't really wanna mess with me
Maybe it's cause I'm a child of destiny
They done seen they friend fall now they wanna do it too
Do you have a clue what I wanna do to you?

(Chorus)
Na, naaaa, na, na, na... na, na, na, na, na
How bout I tell you over a candle light dinner...
(ALRIGHT ALRIGHT!)
Na, naaaa, na, na, na... na, na, na, na, na... (Clarissa)
It's Charles Hamilton and Melissa Joan Hart got dammit I'm...
