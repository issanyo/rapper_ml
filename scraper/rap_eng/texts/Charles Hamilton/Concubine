[Intro]
Hey my name is Charles, i know what your name is already
Heh now that we got that introduction out the way
Let me introduce you to my lifestyle heh
I do the music and I make love taheh
Yo

[Verse 1]
She got a body like the middle of a letter
But she can't get into the middle until i let her
I never had a steady girlfriend until now
So tell me "are you ready girlfriend?"
You know about my other half right? aight
But you wanna give me that ass right? right
So how about we try something nonconventional
Not subliminal since you gotta get it tho
My girl bad and she think you cute
And you already know what the hell i think of you
So what you need to do is stop acting like a nun
You know what i mean stop acting like you dumb
I rap because it's fun, i fuck cause i want to
And i don't give a fuck cause i want you
You got a man? ha stop the lies
I'm ya man, hold my hand you my concubine

[Chorus]
I ain't gotta be faithful, cause i'm happy that you're here baby thank you
OH YEAH! Concubine OH YEAH!
(let your hair down baby) concubine (Woo, yeah)
Maybe you need a little headroom
You and the other girls have your own bedroom (Put your roller skates on)
OH YEAH! Concubine OH YEAH! Concubine

[Verse 2]
My wife is my wife, you my concubine
With my wife is where i spend lots of time
But i love you all like we all walked down the altar together
We all fall down like london bridges, these young dumb bitches
Wanna be in your spot, but no one can get it (heh)
It's just me, you and the misses
But i do it well you can't feel the difference
But the difference is, we ain't gon have no differences
We just love and love and love some more
Keep you drugged and bugged til you touch the floor
It's a secret society, just don't lie to me
What goes on stays between you, my wife and me
Finally i can explain supersoniclove, a lot of love
Because there ain't really a lot of us

[Chorus]
I ain't gotta be faithful, cause i'm happy that you're here baby thank you
(I choose you babe)
OH YEAH! OH YEAH!
(For them grown and sexy women)
Maybe you need a little headroom, (you ain't gotta show id to get in the clubs right?)
You and the other girls have your own bedroom (Awesome)
OH YEAH! Concubine OH YEAH! Concubine

[Verse 3]
Play your role and we got no issues
If you question it, i dismiss you
The witch docta, the hit droppa, the big poppa
Are you kim, gotcha it's not a sin
I just know how to live and you know i live propa
So just take a little chance with ya man
Put ya roller skates on, just dance if ya can like

*beat breakdown*

*The sample says "come on do it*

[Verse 3 cont.]
You feel it
You see it
Don't conceal it
You need it
Act like you really need a new reason
Fuck hot i can make you a new season
The new season of blind date my way
Why hate?, my way or the highway
Too bad that my way is the highway
So roll up like today is friday (ha ha)
Yeeeeeeaaahhhh
Hehehe

(talking)

Hard to believe i'm 20 right?
Ha ha uh
Oh don't worry, i'm..i'm a lot older that you think
Just roll up in the pink ha ha uh

*Beat breaks down*

(still talking)

This is what grown women do right? ha ha ha
Oh

Get comfortable or something
Act like you in the presence of grown men
Ha ha yeah
You thought that i was 20 i wouldn't know about this shit
It's that rock creek park
Taha
Aight let me show you how i switch it up
Oh

[Chorus]

I ain't gotta be faithful, cause i'm happy that you're here baby thank you
OH YEAH! OH YEAH!
Maybe you need a little headroom
