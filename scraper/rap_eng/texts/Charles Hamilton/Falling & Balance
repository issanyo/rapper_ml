[Intro]
I know I done told you about..
50 million times how I feel about you..
Just speak to me alone..
I'm just telling you what I want..

[Verse 1]
I don't think it's meant to be, e
Cause she loves her work more than she loves me
And honestly at 23 I would probably love my work more than I did she
And I ain't even mad that I felt what I felt, if anything I'm mad at myself
What was love at first sight for me.. Was just another night for she
I could be wrapped so quick in a trance that I could fall in love and never ever get in her pants
Damn
But that's me.. And she's her
In a past life I can see what we were
Always together like stereo speakers
80's baby making, we Adidas sneakers
She could put Charles to bed every time she uncrossed and crossed her legs

[Hook]
I can't help fallin'
I need balance cause I can't help fallin'
But you my balance and I can't help fallin'
Without balance I'm stuck with crawlin'
So I gotta put my all in
I need balance cause I can't help fallin'
But you my balance and I can't help fallin'
Without balance I can't help crawlin'

[Verse 2]
There's another chick and she's in love with me
And she ain't afraid to show it to me publicly
Either huggin' me, or fuckin' me, it doesn't e-
Ven matter, wish I could kidnap her
Take her to the perfect world where it's the perfect time to be the perfect girl
But I already have a prior conviction
So I'm stuck with the "she" I met in pride of this one
She reminds me of my prior addiction
I feel it in my veins I get high with her kisses
She make me fantasize in her kitchen
Inside of her kitten, her thighs on the dishes
I cum, she cums, we cum
And we becomes royalty in our kingdom
And I know we not seeing each other
So why I wanna cry when I see her with another

[Hook]
I can't help fallin'
I need balance cause I can't help fallin'
But you my balance and I can't help fallin'
Without balance I'm stuck with crawlin'
So I gotta put my all in
I need balance cause I can't help fallin'
But you my balance and I can't help fallin'
Without balance I can't help crawlin'

[Verse 3]
So here I am again
Charles Hamilton
Superhead DVD in my hand again
All alone, feeling like less of a man again
More like a mannequin
Call up my mans and them
Yo where the hoes at? They with they girlfriends
And in that instant I feel my world end
I'm alone cause I really need to focus
But I'm alone and I feel so hopeless
Being lonely hurts and she knows this
She got no expectations or motive
I'm just happy that she put me on notice
And didn't string me along on that pinocchio shit
Oh shit this is what it has to be
Gotta treat the future like the past, I see
But before I get to cry
Can I please have that one last kiss goodbye?

[Hook]
I can't help fallin'
I need balance cause I can't help fallin'
But you my balance and I can't help fallin'
Without balance I'm stuck with crawlin'
So I gotta put my all in
I need balance cause I can't help fallin'
But you my balance and I can't help fallin'
Without balance I can't help crawlin'

[Outro]
So serious 'bout you..
I just.. All the time I see you..
I just.. I don't know how to explain it..
I just.. I know there's something there
I just.. We got, um..
I don't ever know what I'm talking about..
Just hit me up another time.. Maybe I'll make more sense then
Haha.. I just don't wanna let go
And not have enough faith in us
Ya naw mean?
I kinda got used to waking up with you
So like waking up and not being around you
Just.. It don't feel the same
Forreal
I miss you
I miss you..
I miss you
