You blow my mind, baby (You blow my mind, baby)
Iâ€™m so alive with you, baby
You blow my mind, baby
You blow my mind, baby, baby

[Verse 1: Max B]
I push a button, the car will disappear
The candies they pop out, baby let's put it in the air
Dippin' in the 7 all black Copper's hating my style
Cause I don't chase a pack, my money coming in piles
Quick to buy, better yet, cut the check, it don't matter
As long as my pockets is getting fatter, had her, even had her friends too
Baby I'm the dog give me room, That queezy get me in the mood
With my nigga Charles, that be Charlie, probably looking at my life
Running from the authorities 'bout to go to trial, got a trial, cause this child's
Straight baby momma say she needs me, now she wouldn't need me
Say she out on these streets, cloggin' up the lame baby, they...
Be loving you out in Japan, sent some bitches back, said they was wavy
Made em fly home on the Lear, baby let's get up outta here north pole!

[Hook 1: Max B]
I'll be just fine...
Mommy like my style...
She said: "I'm never gonna let you go..."
She said: "You're cold as the north pole"

[Verse 2: Charles Hamilton]
Stunting was never a habit for me
I just happened to be, in the places
You imagining be, Strange people chasin' after me
Actually half of what I see, doesn't even matter to me
I rap for peace, of mind when I shatter a beat
Laugh at the weak tryna man up, stand up against me
Till I act like a beast, then they clam up
I don't need a hammer, I'm something they can't touch
Real niggas say my music they a fan of
"Charles your flow is so damn nuts"
You looking for a track? then hook up a pack
I can go to Brooklyn and back with a back pack
Fuck a hatch back, me and Max getting smacked
Riding around in a black ac and he said he got some clips
If you cats act, but I'm chilling, living what I write
And grinning, I'm in the best position of my life
Owwwwwwww... (Haha)

[Hook 2: Charles Hamilton]
Take me to the sky...
Make me wanna fly...
So look me in the eyes...
And tell me I ain't fly...
