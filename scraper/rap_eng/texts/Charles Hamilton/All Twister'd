Overdosing in Nova Scotia with the coldest snow. You niggas know the boldness. The bolder it gets, the colder shit gets. The focused it is. You not even near it. Hotter than a poet with a spirit. Got a lot to jot. but I don't even know that you can hear it. Since the problem is I have to listen to shit, I'm going to make the hottest bitch jizz when I drop shit. Why is she so hot, man? I thought I was the hottest. And now she got hot pants and now she's a goddess. I spank her, thank her. I got a lot of honest shit that I can drop without not thinking. And that was so normal, normalcy. I need to report to me, reportedly. Ain't no body better than me recording. Therefore, lay it all down or sing

You and I can rule it all
In just one kiss, or just one hit
Got me all Twister'd up
Got me all Twister'd up
Got me all Twister'd up

No room for competition. Just hotties dripping, waiting to get in a hot position. Ask the ladies how I hit it from the back. Pass the crazy, and my mission was to pass you. But I have to keep you after I smash you. I have to believe you because you have half of me inside the deep of you. When I rhyme I think about the deep of you. With time we'll reach inside together and there will be a fetus that grew. And I'm just thinking about breeding with you. Yes, there's a reason for you to love me. But I ain't really loving me. When I love me I thug me. I'm Pimp C in the new Beneration. Beneration, Jason with the Masons

You and I can rule it all
In just one kiss, or just one hit

Got me all Twister'd up
Got me all Twister'd up

Niggas been waiting for a bridge. What I look like, KRS?
C-H-A-R-L-E-S, the greatest yet when it comes to speaking. I fucking spaded a wet chick. Imagine if that chick got into magic. But that's how she got the kid! I practice tolerance of all you faggots, and that's what's bothering my wig. Homophobic, pardon the past. Yeah, I got raped, nigga. Pardon my ass. And that's since I don't have the heart to spazz. And when I actually spazz, you ain't got the heart for that. Bret Hart except with a hard fist and a hard dick inside of a chick with a hard hat. Hi, Jennifer Richardson. I've been waiting to benefit when we get it in
