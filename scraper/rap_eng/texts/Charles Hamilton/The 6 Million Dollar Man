I am unstoppable. Those who try to stop me find it to not be logical. Or probable. Obstacles I toss just by existing. My loss I offer to all y'all. Try to find it. It's my clause of living. The bottom line is my existence. Try to get rid of it. My bottom line is SEGA. And I do not want to be called a Player. Bay- (bae), away. Like "-watch". Take away the Bay- and find out who's dry and who would like to -watch. The new Moses. I do dope shit. Who's focused? Listen to the bars while a nigga's in a car...

FUCK THAT!
I never mess up
I never mess up...
FUCK THAT!
I never mess up!
I never mess up!
FUCK THAT!
I NEVER MESS UP!!
I'M LIKE A MACHINE!
I'm like a machine... (!)

My intelligence was enough to son a reverend. Now he's out committing sins. Harlem is for the condemned. Greater Refuge Tem-P-L-E was just a template. To people who were trying to be as faithful as me when I'm on the M-I-C. So microphone, I see you decided to level up. But my head is up. So guess what? You are now beneath me. Loud as the sour that I beseech thee with. I like to smoke. And I don't like to get high and question my folks. So microphone, stay down.  (!) At least for me. You can be on my chain. On the hip. Because I almost got my brain on my hip. Doing some dangerous shit. Let's go!

FUCK THAT!
I never mess up
I never mess up...
FUCK THAT!
I never mess up!
I never mess up!
FUCK THAT!
I NEVER MESS UP!!

I'm tired of dumbing down. How 'bout y'all smarten up? Y'all niggas is proud of yourselves because you're hard as fuck? Well, Charles is just another measurement of seeing where y'all ever been. And you haven't been ANYWHERE, except for where I brought y'all! Look at what I taught y'all! I don't offer y'all nothin'! I should let my niggas off y'all! And they get off, easy! There's no yard for them! Unless they get on they argument shit... (!) then they become a dog, and it's the backyard, again. Let them in the house, too! 'Cause they special, and I don't wanna doubt them dudes! I roll deep, nigga. OD, nigga. You don't know me, nigga. Feeling like I'm sippin' OE, nigga! I JUST OD'D, NIGGA!
