Check it, Yo

[Verse 1]
Crack another smile when I crack another code
Rapping like a viper but happens to like soul
This is a brick in my pyramid delivery
Bitch niggas, I refuse to show chivalry
Now I got more rivalries, then siblings
Give a little ring to my civil nipple ring lickers
I'm a kicker like fink-el and Einhorn
An animal but __i know you thinking its my porn
Nah, I straight go ace ventura
Making sure I'm tasting the face of a nature-al girl I adore, what?
Play secure if your dating a whore
But face sure has a way of breaking doors down
When your dating for
The Caped Crusader of blazing the ladies raw,
Is saying you amy, so be safe when you explore, great
A P.S.A is stunting like I'm jackies daddy
Exactly, I'm happy, sunny days get at me

[Hook]
Put your fears in your pocket get happy
Put your tears in your pocket get happy
If I'm dragging you down get at me
Ladies I'm grown man kidnap me
Get happy (x8)

[Verse 2]
Never been in a better mood than right now
I don't know why, but I let the vendetta off the groove just bite down
On the head of the clueless white frown
I make better music when emotions are upside down
I rarely show emotion, "Speak No Louder" sampled "No Emotion",
Hold me closer hoes, and pros in poetry 
Had a Minaj with adjectives and god
Had to describe the feeling of no plastic when inside her spot
Though I write a lot, the spot was the tightest
So my spot is somewhere next to your Highness and Imus
Whatever the line is, I drag my blanket behind it
A fat enough ass, you pass the dutch
I smack and guide it to my lap as I sit, happy as fuck
Happier since god would be happy to fuck
Is that blasphemous? in laughter we trust
She knows my heart, I confuse passion with lust. what!?

[Hook]
Put your fears in your pocket get happy
Put your tears in your pocket get happy
If I'm dragging you down get at me
Ladies I'm grown man kidnap me
Get happy (x8)

[Verse 3]
Turbulence in my flight, the nervousness has reached the height
But the height of my superbness vision is bright
So I permanently would like to say, that ive earned the right today
To burn the sight of what may cause me to cry at night
With that said, give me some herbal relaxed stuff
Word to that stuff, germs are to sad to act up
Reverse, perverse to catch up, pack the verse up
When you catch, cause the turbulence is just flights that are in the sky at the same time as us
That have past us, with established laughter telling us to keep our asses up
That could suck if half of us was trapped in prozac dust, just tryna keep from cracking up
But, which crack could have you passing up the action of cracking up at the touch of a blackened verse

[Hook]
Put your fears in your pocket get happy
Put your tears in your pocket get happy
If I'm dragging you down get at me
Ladies I'm grown man kidnap me
Get happy (x8)
