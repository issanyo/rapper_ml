The Twilight Zone is not necessarily a place I'd like to roam. Especially when I'm quite alone. So hold my hand and leave my "alone" alone. And I will continue to stroll as if I don't even know how to get back home. I will die in that zone and come back in that zone. In the black of the spiral, Yin and Yang, I have to admire a different name. I am no longer the Sire. I've been stronger. Or trying to define the stronger *as,* or *with,* or *for.* (And this is all for and from the awesome one stuck in the Twilight Zone)

Go off, be a show off
Go off, be a show off
Go off, be a show off
Go off, be a show off

The evil laughter of one Ridley Scott has me breathing faster than a track meet. And the ladies who are wishing to attract me with their sweat are mad at me and actually wish to regret their decisions of being a Dad who needs to forget their past. I easily forget their laughs and need to respect the Dads who were beating their ass back when they'd get checked for bad behavior. I leave it, the entire situation, and go back to the Twilight Zone as my neighbor

Go off, be a show off
Go off, be a show off
Go off, be a show off
Go off, be a show off

From a spiral to a vortex into a funnel of more sex. And the sex becomes conversation. The Blessed One in conversation becomes the one who stepped into the Twilight Zone impatient and "expectating," a word which doesn't exist until one's anticipation allows you to dance freely. Losing the sweat from drinking and using your sweat and next thinking to not do something you'd regret. As I roam back into the Twilight Zone

Go off, be a show off
Go off, be a show off
Go off, be a show off
Go off, be a show off
Go off, be a show off
Go off, be a show off
Go off, be a show off
Go off, be a show off
