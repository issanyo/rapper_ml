What I did with a pen and paper was considered centralization. I added Hamilton- in it to make an interesting conversation. Now, as intricate as my contemplation is the mind of people who are listening to my conversations. Either within, or reading these papers. Pages. But I keep my eyes closed, so I don't know if people are even seeing me as a sage while I'm entering on stages. My wisdom is my flyness, and I get it in with my flyness. And my flyness is my highness. I keep my fly, zipped. I ain't tryna get my private licked at the moment, so I am not answering a text. I'm just letting Y'ALL know Hamilton's the best!

Show me where that weed is and (that's where I'm at, y'all; that's where I'm at!)
Bad hoes with they weave in! Nigga... (that's where I'm at, y'all; that's where I'm at!)
I don't believe it's happening! (it's 2012 all over again!)
I don't believe it's happening!
Oh-whoa-woe-whoa-oh!!!

Rape is a mechanism of control. So, I say to the system, "YOU BETTER LET ME GO!" Even if I never f'n know if it happened with Boe, I will still "go into the crib, holdin' on to my dick, knowing what it is, and hoping I can find some bitch I can go in and slid-..." -E (slide). Listen to me, while I pop E (papi). Like a priest. Unfortunately, I've got to be the nastiest when it comes to out of sight jotting. Out of sight? Out of mind. This is coming out of my mouth from in my mind, and my sight could be blind. Being blinded by how many times I've lied. Trying to make people by my side. As *side* revolves into *dies*, I sip St. Ides. Now tell me. Who wanna ride?

While Dilla and Beyonce were [smooch-smooch] kissing, I went to Baltimore and went to Heroin sniffing. That's the only way I got out the position of NOT REALLY WANTING TO BE SPITTING! I DON'T GIVE A FUCK ABOUT Y'ALL ENOUGH TO SAY FUCK Y'ALL, BUT I LOVE Y'ALL. SO HOPEFULLY, Y'ALL CAN CUDDLE AND ALL CHARLES THOUGHTS WILL FALL OUT. AND I'LL GET ALL THOSE THOUGHTS. AND THEN? "Now, you're all out!" Gotta be the greatest. So if we brawl out, it'll be the same as if Boe decide(s) to ball out. I could lose my skill. But I use my pills. I do not kill. But... do I thrill? Like Mike. No Bow Wow. So, bow down. You know my style is anger, betrayal and happy endings. I stay on the trail. It has to be the beginning
