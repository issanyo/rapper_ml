[Verse 1]
I woke up to see, on the caller ID
A call from you, and a call from she
Now me, being me. Doesn't seem strange
It means that I, been free
Elementary. simply, because what temps me
Is what's in me, a pure heart
A classical that's so priceless
Hold close to the lifeless
No snow. But, the ice is froze right beside the cheek
Damn. That the tear she cried, resides, life is sweet
I would like to be
The boyfriend of every woman, everywhere
But, being everywhere is a pain in the dairyaire
Wanna give my heart. But, don't know how too
I wanna grow now. Can't slow down
(Woah now)
It's just a thought
But I feel real bad when I brush it off

[Hook]
You just run across my mind
Every now and then
Every now and then
Every now and then
I wonder if you are fine
Every now and then
Every now and then
Every now and then

[Verse 2]
Now she's like, mmm. On some other shit
I love it when she trips
But it doesn't make any sense
To sit and be in bliss with this chick
'Cause who I wanna be with, is too close to being missed
No secret, but peep this
I reach in to see if we can get deep in the zone
To make it a home, somewhere in the deep
She said, "I'm scared if she squeaks." Damn
I wasn't prepared for her to tweak
But I didn't look like couldn't bare on my feet
I had my barefeet and my pride, you can't scare me
Dear me. Don't get out-runned, Sincerely
But her love is of the fear of me, clearly
So I get paranoid when she near me
But, I hear 3 birds whistle ever clear tweets
I swear, I feel heaven share peace
Then the thought leaks

[Hook]
You just run across my mind
Every now and then
Every now and then
Every now and then
I wonder if you are fine
Every now and then
Every now and then
Every now and then

[Bridge]
Maybe you're on my mind
Maybe the other way around
Either way I look I can find
That you gon' forever be down

[Hook]
You just run across my mind
Every now and then
(follow me now)
Every now and then
(follow me now)
Every now and then
(Cross my mind)
I wonder if you are fine
Every now and then
Every now and then
(And then I stop)
Every now and then
