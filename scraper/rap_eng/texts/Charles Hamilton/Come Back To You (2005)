[Intro]
I...probably shouldn't even wrote this song...cause our history ain't
All that great but you know...it is what it is. Take a deep breath

[Verse 1]
After all the shit I went through trying to get you
My issue women ricocheted and hit you
I tried hard not give away my *uhhh*...
To any dame that sits with a pretty face and hips
But who knew you too would lose you cool
Quick to want to screw the dude, cute as shoes
Smoothest moves, but stupid you
The thoughts that Cupid threw were meant for the both of us
But it opened up your heart to them unruly dudes
While neglecting the musical, and by accident
The musical stay attracting chicks with the hugest boobs
One girl even said, "You so cute with this
You should move with me and lose that stupid bitch
But ooh so foolishly, I choose to be with you cause you so used to me
And they just new to this, that's the way I want it cause...

[Hook]
I could find the most beautiful girl
Petite, cute face, and beautiful curves
But I ain't got nothing better to do in this world
But to come back to you

See, you could cheat on me, sleep with my friends
Get caught, apologize, and go creeping again
I know that I should leave, but you see, in the end...
I always come back to you

[Verse 2]
I get tight when you insist I've been dipping and hitting...
Your friends, slipping like it's no body's business
Then you go on and flip, start throwing the dishes
Then we start arguing, groaning and bitching
Everything but the kitchen sink, we started again
Like a high school version of Marshall and Kim (Bitch!)
You hate me, I hate you, but we love each other for it
Never forged it, all real, no need to force it
And I will never for-get the times we had
You always wore a smile, I never found you mad
But we let the chicken-heads get ahead of what's real
And the player types that just came to pipe, done deal
And even though I moved on to new loves
The truth was what we had was true love (honest)
And though we talk like it's any other day
Still love each other, I won't have it any other way

[Hook]

See, you could cheat on me, sleep with my friends
Get caught, apologize, and go creeping again
I know that I should leave, but you see, in the end...
I always come back to you
Come back to you
I come back to you
Always come back to you

[Outro]
And for some strange reason I still love you
Truly yours, Charles Hamilton
