As much as I focus, you gotta know my LOVE is my focus. And I'm falling in love with my love and... it's hopeless. I can't break up with her, even if she put me on notice. Here's a Lotus kiss. A Flowerbomb like Mike and Wale. That's... Miguel, as far as y'all say. I'm not tryna disrespect what broads say, I'm just saying "Hold on!" every day. Because I'm on the -phone, and I'm on the John when I'm on the -phone, so if you get across the lake, that basically means you're not a mistake. Falling in love should be a Frosted Flake. And I've got the milk. It's called, "Not touching Silk... unless you're me." I've been with the luxuries and other shit of people messing with me. So I'm trying to feel something EXTRA sweet. That means kissing on Heaven's teeth. Come get with me

Are you over me?
Don't touch me there
Because it's too old for me
YOU TOUCHED ME THERE!
You over me
Let me touch you *there*
And I'll just breathe...
Until it's time to take it's toll...

I'm all alone on a road made of gold. Like what I was told about NYC so many ages ago. So with the ancient-est flow, am I allowed to grow up and be gangsta like foes? Because they're all young, and they're who gets exposed whenever they let loose their tongue. So, let me be useful to some and heavy to others. Being a petty motherfucker. If I had the hands, I'd settle motherfuckers. But, I know the law of the land, so SETTLE motherfucker(s). Give up. Your guilt's in your rhymes. And niggas don't realize that rhymes (all the time) are their lines from their mind. It's like it's all scripted. I'm on my grind, and I'm ballistic. Like... bullets. Like I'm full of the shit to get my Pulitzer or a bullet in my dome...

Are you over me?
Don't touch me there
Because it's too old for me
YOU TOUCHED ME THERE!
You over me
Let me touch you *there*
And I'll just breathe...
Until it's time to take it's toll...

What could I go to sleep with, in my mind? I don't listen to The Weeknd (in my mind). As a matter of fact, I'm off the deep end (in my mind). So please, ma. Come unwind. I could be talking to my mother or on the pimp grind of having chicks listening to my shit ten times, times the 10 times of The Time of the Ten when I was Mr. Then Again. Yo. I showed up on your screen. Like an Apple. Niggas wanna grapple like I'm tryna buy The Big Apple. No. I'm tryna live my life. Make my brother proud. Make my mother proud. And spread the lud (loud) around. Spread the love around. Aw man. Turn the fucking glove around. Damn. The new MiJack, but in my backpack is something you gotta climax at!

Are you over me?
Don't touch me there
Because it's too old for me
YOU TOUCHED ME THERE!
You over me
Let me touch you *there*
And I'll just breathe...
Until it's time to take it's toll...
