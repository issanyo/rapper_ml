[Intro]
Night time, is the biggest onomatopoeia you can say
HAHA…
… Uh

[Verse 1]
Nights in the Palazzo
View of the grove
Taking Elle women on a tour, through my beautiful home…
It wasn’t long ago, that every song I wrote, was all in hope, that all the broke thoughts would go, OFF and float, like hallway smoke, when coffins row
In the hood, it’s a coffin for colds
No cure, but we livin’ to die
Like dyin' is another form of livin’ a lie
So we livin’ to live
While we wishin’ to fly
Envision the sky, kiss it goodbye, and listen to I
We goin’ higher than the heights of average
Afraid of heights? Take the rites of passage
You never seen a star before tonight’s flight?
Midday is like a plugged-in Nite Brite
… And all the other planets lookin’ type hype
Like, “Charles, I know you ain’t forget my Sprite, right?”

[Chorus]
We all celebrities now, because we gettin’ money!
Everybody in town, because we gettin’ money!
I think I’m wearin’ a crown, because we getting’ money NOW…
But every time I look DOWN...

... I emerge from the ground with a FROWN

WHAT AM I GONNA DO NOW...
WHAT AM I GONNA DO NOW...

... All the money that I get NOW

[Verse 2]
First-class flights to conferences WHERE, my confidence IS, what got me this, HERE
Moment to share witcha’
Know that I’m here witcha’
Even when I’m not, and I gotta say “There.” witcha’
Even when I am, and I’m able to hear witcha’
There
It’s official. I can be clear witcha
Fear, is a queer, if you stick out your rear
Dyin’ one moment, just to live out the year
ALL the inspiration I give out to my peers…
I wanna “duff” some n1ggas;
Spit out my beer
…
But that would imply that I’m not sober…
… And when it come’ to duffin’ n1ggas, I’m Homer
You’re more Barney
Whatchu’ want, punk?
You can’t harm me
You lookin’ punch drunk
Save the hate for the President, ‘cause I’ll “Family Guy” your whole run
Straight make you IRRELAVENT

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
I’m gettin’ head from a porn star; Sleepin’ with a label mate
Dating the craziest little lady from the Angel state
Good friends with Mr. “808s and Heartbreak”;
I’m compression in a hard day, my profession ain’t all day…
It’s every day
Rock star
N1ggas imitating me, like it’s not hard
Can’t stop, Charles. I’m Bubba Ray Dudley
Show, put these n1ggas on a table that’s a breakaway…

… Like sweatpants
That snap-on
I need a track, so I can Slim Jim rap on
That means snap on. Elbow drop
I’m more focused than ever, I tell hoes “STOP.”
I don’t f*ck just to bust a nut, ‘cause, when the lustin’ rushes up
What are you stuck with?
A puddle of “muck“, a b*tch that got stuck to you, and vice-versa

It’s not luck, it SUCKS

… Charles Hamilton

[Chorus]

[Talking During Chorus]
The only way to move when you’re on top of the world…

…

… is at top speed

HAHAHAHA…
?Catch up to ‘em!?
