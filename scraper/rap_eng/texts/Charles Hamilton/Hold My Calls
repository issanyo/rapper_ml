Eyes all puffy and stuff. Clouds all fluffy and I call my eyeballs Puffy. I've been writing all day. iPod lucky, my ball pen all stuffy. Call my girl, "Baby?" She be like "What-y?" Her body is major, I take time to study. She's like "Don't rush me." I'm say "I know, lovely." She says I'm so cuddly. Let's take a ride in my old buggy. Bumping Muddy, Dudley and Cudi. Eccentric vibes for that kind of ride. But she got to drive, I'm that kind of guy. Bad timing, I suppose, I don't know. But somebody got on the phone to have a 1-on-1 gossip show. Not as cold as Nagano, but I ain't got to know who's got a problem, I'm a hang up. You got to go!

Get that everyday out of my face
Turn your BlackBerry off!
Please don't bring no worry, no fear
Get that riff raff out of here
Turn your Blackberry off!

Gas tank on half, that ain't bad. Pass Madison Ave. cat's made they can't pass. We break past the traffic. The escape path? Made a mad dash behind an ambulette truck. One slip of the peddle and she messed up. CRASH! Face on the dash. And we dressed up. Chest up, I trust her motor skills. I test her motor skills just to know it's real. Looking at the window with her still stomach. Sitting shotgun, feeling like I'm still running. Fans impatient, knowing something ill's coming. Hit up admin "Make sure them bills come in." Because when them bills come in we still run shit. Now let me steal one kiss, as the wheel she grips

Get that day-to-day out of my face
Get that everyday out of my face
Turn your BlackBerry off!
Please don't bring no worry, no fear

Baby, I ain't worried about your foot on the gas. Because you never gassed me up
You never gassed me up and let me die. So I'm alright
