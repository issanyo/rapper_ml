[Intro: Charles Hamilton]
Uh-ha-uh-uh!
Who I sound like? (Hahah...)
Don't me and uncle be flowing alike?
Nah (Hah...)
Yo!

[Verse 1: Charles Hamilton]
Hopped off the 4 train, Utica Ave
No snorting, need a beautiful bag
Saw a little poor thing, beautiful ass
But I was snorting so she moving too fast
And if I approach her, I'll be moving too fast
Tryna get the chocha, a beautiful smash!
And I am a beautiful catch
But only if I ain't been using the bag
Nose bleeding! My t-shirt I use as a rag
Tryna find a dealer, who could be that? (Hah)
Damn, so beautifully I ask
And I'm walking so slow but my heart beating fast
And my dream was to see the world
So I hail a cab and treat the shit like Seaworld
I'mma be Shamoo when I hit my stop
Hop out, I ain't paying you shit! Gotta get them rocks!

[Hook]
I keep my thumb out when I need me a ride...
I keep my gun out when I think I'mma die...
Cause I got...
Hustling dreams, hustling dreams
I got...
Hustling dreams, hustling dreams
I got...
Hustling dreams, hustling dreams
I got...
Hustling dreams, hustling dreams

[Verse 2: Miguel Bones]
Look!
If I come to the trap, you better have my money quick
Can't take no shorts, I'm on my money shit
No I.O.U.'s by tomorrow
I don't give a fuck if you gotta borrow
No change, no change, straight bills in my hand
I'm the guy with them pills and the grams
Don't give a fuck if you gotta steal from your man
Or rob ya moms or steal from your Gram's
It's still 40 a gram
If you got it, better holla at your man's
If I hit the trap, ya better have them dollars in your hand
Wanna get high?
Get that money by any means
Just because you rap don't make you different from any fiend
One hit from this work
You will have plenty dreams!
Don't hit me with that line like "Do you remember me?"
I'm not tryna hear you breathing heavily
Just hit me back if you want that Heavy D
That Heavy D

[Hook]
I keep my thumb out when I need me a ride...
I keep my gun out when I think I'mma die...
Cause I got...
Hustling dreams, hustling dreams
I got...
Hustling dreams, hustling dreams
I got...
Hustling dreams, hustling dreams
I got...
Hustling dreams, hustling dreams

[Verse 3: Charles Hamilton]
My fingernails are black, so I reach for his long white tee
He told me it won't be long before I'm gone, nightly
Meaning, he pulls that 9 piece out and I get 9 pieces of bullets
In my head. So much for Pulitz
-ER, a E.R. gonna be where I'm at
Know he hard
I'm such a jackass for asking for crack
But then again, crack isn't coke and I actually hope
He gonna pass me some coke
To have me passing a smoke called a cloud
And I ain't roll up a blunt, how about now?
Look at the ground, I'mma bounce down
But when I come down I'm still a couple of pennies short
So I don't think he's gonna sell it to me anymore
My dream was to see the world
And when I snort, I can see the world
But I ain't tryna snort cause I ain't tryna force
This nigga to be the world -ender of my world
Beginners in my world saying...

[Hook]
I keep my thumb out when I need me a ride...
I keep my gun out when I think I'mma die...
Cause I got...
Hustling dreams, hustling dreams
I got...
Hustling dreams, hustling dreams
I got...
Hustling dreams, hustling dreams
I got...
Hustling dreams, hustling dreams
