Hate to break the glue
We use to make the news
But I have to go away from you
Later boo
Great improvements from the last time we tried love
But mistakes have prove
This is the last time we should try love
And you can justify the bruises
When you up and supply me with the juices
I use to quench my thirst
Far from simple
It hurts to be a nipple tickler
The biggest kicker is you don’t get the picture
I treat me like your whore
I receive your vocal chords
When I do these things to make you scream
Lately it seems more force is making you cream
Rather then making you believe
So in a haste I leave
Sleep with my dream lady and queens
Return the next day after learning what sex may stress
When you’re concerned with tongue written essays
The young kitten is a mess
When my text is laid


I hear you talking
But I am so damn loud
You can hear me walking
Cause I am so damn proud of me
( I only hear what I want to)
I press mute on the love
( I only hear what I want to)
I press mute on the love
( I only hear what I want to)
I press mute on the love


Uh
You still text me
“You’re still sexy”
But foreal
I feel neglected when intercepting the breeze
Perhaps a pill could let me catch the thrill of ecstasy
But still
You threaten me when you say “chill” let it be
I will heel but allegedly we carry ill feelings towards the letter C
True or not?
Abusive yet hot
You’re a meth pipe
Lets get right
Im as precious as a festive night in Texas
Cause niggas know racism undo
Apples eve
(I only hear what I want to)
And you move too fast
To slow my super nova love
You are a loser when slowing up
Abusing the color of the future
By using logic
Pink hatred
Equates a Hamilton navis
Try it
New color
Girl find a new lover
Cause pink is the hue
And im moving under the covers
And you like that


I hear you talking
But I am so damn loud
You can hear me walking
Cause I am so damn proud of me
( I only hear what I want to)
I press mute on the love
( I only hear what I want to)
I press mute on the love
( I only hear what I want to)
I press mute on the love


Shhhh
I pitch with a chick from Grenada
My finger in the ring
Then I give it away
But
Listen love
This is the way love goes
Stay up or just pray
For another go round
With Mr. Just Love To Go Down
Still answer your calls
Cause I juggle hoes
Im a clown
The deeper the love
The less we speak
You call me everyday
It’s the sex we keep
You dammed yourself giving me a ultimatum
Cause ultimately it’s a walk im taking
Am I using you?
So what you’re beautiful
Im Charles Hamilton
The reason that you are you
Fly robin fly’em
With the silver connection
Our love was sweet
But not as real as my exit

CH talks“ Charles Hamilton. Thank you Thank you, I don’t mind taking a bow right here. Appreciate the standing ovation. You may be seated. As I rise”
