[Verse 1]
I've lost my Innocence
I've lost my confidence
I've lost my common sense
I've sold my soul for Common cents
My hell is in my mind, My cell is in my time
I spend my time within my mind, so I am hard to find
No!
I don't mean to escape myself, Before I crawl out of my body and Rate Myself
I don't mean to grade Myself, I hate myself because I Play myself
Make me fell better than Ever
You and me, all friends or loving Together
This Is a nightmare, I see It right here
I see It quite Clear, It feels right here

[Hook]
No! Get me Outta Your System!
Get me Outta the System!
You can't cure me, There is no Pure me, Only Fury, You can't Turn Me!
So
Get me Outta the System!
You can't cure me, There's no Pure me, Only Fury, You can't Turn Me!

[Verse 2]
This Is demonic, My addiction must be Chronic
I must be honest, I feel happy when I'm on It
Someone has Stripped me
The needle edge just pricked me
She said that she would lick me, but Instead she left me twitching
No!
So I don't mean to escape myself, Before I crawl out of my body and Rape Myself
I don't mean to grade Myself, I hate myself because I Play myself
Make me fell better than Ever
You and me, all friends or loving Together
This Is a nightmare, I see It right here
I see It quite Clear, It feels right here

[Hook]
No! Get me Outta Your System!
Get me Outta the System!
You can't cure me, There is no Pure me, Only Fury, You can't Turn Me!
So
Get me Outta the System!
You can't cure me, There's no Pure me, Only Fury, You can't Turn Me!

[Bridge]
I need you, I don't want to need you, I don't want to love You
I'm just addicted to you 
You make me love everything that I hate
And Hate everything I love
And made me hate myself for loving You
