[Intro]
Alright, alright, alright, alright, alright
Well obviously, Simone wasn't Amy Rose
Maybe she was Amy Rose
She just couldn't make it in this game
Or maybe if I had a fucking female to lay next to
Shit!! Fuck!
Always gotta imagine some fucking female that'll
Love me or wake up fucking alone every fucking morning
Alright (4x)
Get it together (4x)
Alright alright ummm I need a woman

[Verse 1]
I gotta Maserati mami
Oh my God she's a hottie
Her body is outta this zone
The hottest commodity
And obviously I wanna get her number
Running faster this rapper can get in her bumper to bumper
I wonder
Would she dig me if she met me?
I ain't all that pretty but she sexy
If she let me
We could race with no finish line
If she didn't mind
"The passenger side" she replied
I said "please believe I see ya g"
Now you gon see the speed of me
She revved the engines
I tied my kicks
Imma show that pretty miss that I'm the shit
Imma quick Maserati
She said "you betta catch up"
I said "I look better in your honor, don't mess up"
I said "baby you know that I'm dope, fess up"
You gotta driver but baby I'm better
Guess what?

[Hook]
I know you feel me so baby just lemme know
I know you ready, I'm ready so let's go
This ain't game I will never get old
Put the pedal to the metal let's go
You gave me the eye
So pull over to the side of the road
I wanna..
I'm gonna..

[Verse 2]
I'm doing a buck 80 and I'm just pacing
I ain't begun racing
You left in the dust lady?
Couldn't see the Maserati behind me
All of a sudden the Lambo's flashing lights blind me
I say "what's the problem?"
She says "you match me
My paint job and the color of my back seat"
Not to mention, you know I can go at that speed
I said "aww that's sweet, now knock it off"
You know I'm faster than that
Faster than a magic hat
Can pack a rabbit in a hat
I black
She said "that's wack
How you faster than sound but you can barely photo finish wit a hatch back"
I said "race me then"
She said "aight"
Before she pulled off she saw a blur of blue light
My words are too tight
So Maserati watch it
Stop watch it
Before you can start it I stop

[Hook]
I know you feel me so baby just lemme know
I know you ready, I'm ready so let's go
This ain't game I will never get old
Put the pedal to the metal let's go
You gave me the eye
So pull over to the side of the road
I wanna..
I'm gonna..

[Verse 3]
The Lambo made me lose sight of the Maserati
So I got hot on my feet
And preceded to speed
To the location me in the previous whip
Decided we would meet up and get acquainted with each other real quick
She was pushing the limits of where she could go
So was I but that's shit that you should know
She got me sweating
I got her loosing control
No cruise control
You don't know
Boo you moving super slow
I taunted her
On how the fact I really wanted her
Before she knew it I was right in front of her
I front on her
I'm bout to win and then she hit the brakes
I hit a brink wall wit my face
But I kept going
Girl don't be funny I'm to fast too have crashed
I'm disappointed that I had to proof that
She said "My driver don't respect nothin"
So she ditch that nigga hit the reject button
Haha

[Hook]
I know you feel me so baby just lemme know
I know you ready, I'm ready so let's go
This ain't game I will never get old
Put the pedal to the metal let's go
You gave me the eye
So pull over to the side of the road
I wanna...
I'm gonna...
