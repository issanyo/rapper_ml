Uh, ain't what it used to be. When I was used to you and you were used to me. Usually you was steady using me. And now you gotta deal with the fact you losing me. We used to be something that they usually see. Becomes a bitch move when you choose to flee. The shit hurts, can't you see the bruises, B? But shit is nothing, cause none of y'all moving me
See, months passed, now the dude improving, B. So today you nothing but old news to me. See it started with a kiss and ended with a diss. And now I'm convinced she's just another bitch. Like weed and Dutch, just another twist. Forces my mind, hear the resist because. From what you did to me...

What does it mean, what does it mean to be alone?
(I don't know)
How does it feel, how does it feel to be alone?
(I don't know)
I know how you feel, I know how to feel, I know what to feel
And... I don't wanna say that

Now after that shit, I'm like "That's it! Never again I'm falling for a black chick." I give a fuck if she thin or that thick
Only time I'm gonna black is doing this rap shit. But then again, saw the eyes of cinnamon. The cinnamon was coming from a Dominican. It's like a scent again, it forces me to win again. Because the girls in my past forces me to remember them. And that's why I agree with Eminem. You go through hell just so you could be friends with them. And I'm concentrated on what I'm gonna give her. She want an ocean of love, I'm cool with river. And that's when shit begins to fall like September. Then you heart's cold like December, remember?

What does it mean, what does it mean to be alone?
(I don't know)
How does it feel, how does it feel to be alone?
(I don't know)
I know how you feel, I know how to feel, I know what to feel
And... I don't wanna say that...

Now this verse goes to a special friend. I knew from the beginning that we could blend. But, before I start another trend, I gotta ask her. Scared cause I think that this friendship could end. So I just pretend that I'm just a friend. In the dorm room struggling with emotions within. Have me drunk off the love potion again. Asking God why I gotta hold this again. But he gave me a 40, cause that nigga know me. Now I'm on the fire escape smoking a stogie. Look at my left, never forgot what he told me. I.S.A, stop running from the old me. But baby if only I know you. I gotta tell you mami if I go through.. It's OK, just as long as you'll never say...

What does it mean, what does it mean to be alone?
(I don't know)
How does it feel, how does it feel to be alone?
(I don't know)
I know how you feel, I know how to feel, I know what to feel
And... I don't wanna say that
