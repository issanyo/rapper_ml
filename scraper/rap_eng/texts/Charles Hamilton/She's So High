[Produced by Charles Hamilton]

[Verse 1: Charles Hamilton]
Met her at a rave, never stopped grooving
Lost in a trance from the Telepopmusik
I was so gone, she was so there
I know I'm intoxicated but I don't care
Lights keep flashing, she keeps dancing
She's trying to figure out why I keep glancing
This is my chance, I don't want to miss it
Eye contact, something feels different
Two new worlds, our galaxy is distant
I send my radiation, she started drifting
Teleport her over my way that instant
Grabbed her, leaned in her ear and whispered
If your too high and you can't listen
Tune in to the new transmission
Step out of life and make the transition
Step out of life and make the transition

[Chorus: Charles Hamilton]
She's so high, she reached the sky
Look into her eyes, she's so high
She lives inside the clouds, her silence is loud
She screams without a sound, so profound
She's high

[Verse 2: Charles Hamilton]
Left from the rave, hopped in a spaceship
Off to the hard drive, west of the matrix
I was so high, didn't think I could make it
Plus I kept envisioning the woman I was taking (home)
Get her naked (clothes), baby take it (slow)
Ain't no way we gotta (go), I lay in my all pink UF(O)
Land on a lilypad then we (coast)
Pour some digital champagne then (toast)
The bubbles from the champagne make us (float)
Aquatic clouds now we (both) need a (boat)
She's the high I need the most
More than a woman, less than a queen
Stuck in between, reality and dreams
This feels like a movie scene
She's holographic without the screen, knah mean?

[Chorus]

[Bridge: Charles Hamilton]
She's so high
She's so high
She's so high
She's so high

[Chorus X3]
