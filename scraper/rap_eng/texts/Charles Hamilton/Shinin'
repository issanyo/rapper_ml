[Chorus]
Shinin
Can't you see he's Shinin
Can't you see he's Shinin
Ohh Ohh Ohh Ohh Ohh
Shine if you believe me!
Shinin
Can't you see he's Shinin
Shine if you believe me!

[Intro]
Aye!
Thanks for having me
Umm?
My first time here
Good crowd
Hell of a crowd
Im being sarcastic by the way
Yea I had to use the in-house band

[Verse 1: Charles Hamilton]
I was born with more Songz than Trey
Wrote a song a day
No childhood like JonBen√©t
But it was all in faith
That my thoughts could make
Awesome cake
But ultimately dreams fall and break
No job, No life, Just music
So I could just lose my self
Or just lose it
Bong and dutch usage got my mind gone
My lungs foolish and my feelings so fucked up and useless
I'm "Shinin"
But deep inside I'm lying
Tryna gain approval
Making moves that may confuse you
Haters, fakers, they just use you
Make you do some crazy things
But all this hatred makes me think
I'm destined for something
But what is the question
So I dismiss all the stress and im left with (Shinin)

[Hook]
Can't you see I'm shinin'
I gotta Ohh Ohh Ohh Ohh Ohh
To my highest ground
I'm a supernova never dying down
'Cause I'm a diamond
Yes indeed I'm shinin'
I gotta Ohh Ohh Ohh Ohh Ohh
When my passes on
Im shinin' put your sunglasses on

[Verse 2: Charles Hamilton]
I grew up with more Rimes than Leann
I really am, A musical prodigy
Damn
Can't see Charles player
Im lyrically a beast
And this motherfucking beat is in D sharp major
Wake up
Play a couple cords on my Yamaha
'Til my momma got tight, tell me that I gotta stop
She like, "Charles, it's 3:20 in the morning
So at 7 o'clock ya' ass better not be yawning"
I said, "Please mommy
I'm trying to fulfill my fantasies
Bring wealth and honor to my family tree
Add some more green to the branch and leaves"
But lately
When I plan the seed it gets shaky
Gotta face me in the mirror
I'm crazy, a loser, praying for a bitch to upgrade me
'Cause im lazy.. (haha)
So, I better plot for success
To prove that's it not just for sex
I got to be next
Or my hopes and dreams will be gone along with everything I own in a box to the left (Damn)
My best friend's doing his thing in college
I hate it when this nigga try to bring my knowledge
I put myself in the predicament that I'm in
But you won't see me whining
Why? 'Cause I'm (Shinin')

[Hook]
