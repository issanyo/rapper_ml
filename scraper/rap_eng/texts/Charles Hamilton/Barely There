From the moment you walk into Studio 54, who you stalking? The DJ playing your favorite record. You want a lady to respect it.  Lady, you want a fella to check it. As long as he respects it. So, there’s respect in the room. Go there, because I’m next in the room. I want to get the respect of the room. Not get disrespected because of who I groom. Who I make my wife. Who I dance with. Trying to make it right. Say goodnight time to switch. From being that guy to being the one providing in this bitch

Don’t pretend as if you never knew
The groove is inside of you
Don’t pretend like you never knew
There’s something making you move
And I can feel

From jamming to standing. You’re trying to get out because the jam is packed, Tired of dancing. Half the same drink on your lap. The stain on your mink is back. The pain from thinking is back. Your sobriety is trying thee. Trying to escape the event. But why? It’s like your face hit the cement as soon as you got outside. You need something cooler than what you’ve been presuming yourself to be, selfishly. As you groove to the groove as it’s not being helped by the DJ. You may take a day or three to figure out if this is make-believe

Don’t pretend as if you never knew
The groove is inside of you
Don’t pretend like you never knew
There’s something making you move
And I can feel

And I’ll be right by your side if you listened to my song before you went right outside. If it's time to die because you got into a fight, well then I’m not the guy. But I’ll be the little devil on your right shoulder. Telling you the night’s over. But because you are not sober, you gotta hit a soldier with a right. The bad guy at a bad time. A black eye with a wack rhyme. Gotta keep on providing the heat. Stay strong while you lie in the street. The street ain’t moving. You see people moving. Your intoxication's got you not patient. But you’re nodding to the bass, so...

Don’t pretend as if you never knew
The groove is inside of you
Don’t pretend like you never knew
There’s something making you move
And I can feel
