Fuck it i love it and I am the it that I love
Even when I'm lifted above
Giving me love has been a problem for these bitches and thugs Who wish to get up
I am the Highest Eye, I respect that
I get nothing but daps and wet cat
At the same time niggas see me as a setback
Cause I refuse to let me set back
SEGA forever god damnit
Live with the fucking pleasure of them standing
It's not my fault, you not nut not a
But you better be standing
Or you will catch a reprimanding
That most parents give when kids ain't shit
Damn, for the benefit of living I'ma give a shit

It's my life I want to waste it
It's my world but it's hard to face it
Cause everybody wants to rule the world

It's a shame because I can't even have any friends
Them niggas want to laugh at my end
Either have a glass to sip, have some nasty shit to hit
Hash being what they hit or past being the shit
They want to see if me is the shit

But I stay doing deeds in this shit
I want to be treated as royalty
People don't see the little boy in me
I like smiling I even love the circus
But I feel worthless
Leave it to SEGA to make you feel perfect
But you don't believe so you're holding onto me
At the same time you're thinking of dethroning me
Cause some body who was lonely was with me

It's my life I want to waste it
It's my world but it's hard to face it
Cause everybody wants to rule the world

I spend time just going through the crates
To look into the face of doom
Maybe it can take me to, or make me a guide
Make me a dude that is safe in the sky
Making me who? Making me God
But that would make me odd
I want to control your fate then procreate
With a bitch who don't know your fate
Till I her. That's right, trying to be a totalitarian-ist
I ain't scared of the shit
So prepared to get lifted with some niggas who got dough
Trying to toss it at niggas pronto, Tato
I understand it. I understand all
My understanding got me playing handball
With spikes. I miss my mother
But I'm a different motherfucker, come on

It's my life I want to waste it
It's my world but it's hard to face it
Cause everybody wants to rule the world
