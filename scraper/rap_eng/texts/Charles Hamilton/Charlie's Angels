[Verse 1]
Say a prayer for me
Stay in the air for me
You say you care for me and you're staying there for me
In the air, I will be there shortly
Every prayer is my airport and tears are the leer for me
The golden sun glares for me
Somewhere for me someone stares for me
Just zones out seeing nothing but the thoughts I project
Lost in my steps such tears are hard to bear for me
But as I walk the Led Zepplin paved steps
My destination may take your breath away yes
Keep your balance don't [fall from heaven]
Though it's a long walk it ain't far from [heaven]
Angels are the stars
I'm Batman in the dark night
'cuz that man has to stand with his dark plight
But a pink blur C-H illuminates the sky
Using the stars, connect the dots
My heart's right

[Hook]
If I could be a fly on the wall
To hear what you really think about me
I wouldn't be flying at all
Believe what you believe about me
I just live how I live
Forget how I live
My angels come back and hold me down
Then my angels come back and lift me up
And remind me that I do deserve the crown

[Verse 2]
This ain't a love song
This is my way of saying what's wrong
With people who believe that all the love's gone
People would rather greenback so much that their heart is black
Romance is something for them to scream
But that ain't what the issue is
Even angels fear love when they don't know what their mission is
I wonder if God has to tell 'em to chill
Cause they'd still be in heaven even if they were never revealed
If at one point you'd end up falling
You wouldn't even be the one that God would be calling
Fall is for Autumn
The season changed
Replenished but finished like Autumn leaves and rain
Some would repeat the degrees of pain
While the rest just spring from pain
To receive the wings of fame
So chill like the season ignored
Freezing for sure cause we don't wanna grieve anymore

[Hook]
If I could be a fly on the wall
To hear what you really think about me
I wouldn't be flying at all
Believe what you believe about me
I just live how I live
Forget how I live
My angels come back and hold me down
Then my angels come back and lift me up
And remind me that I do deserve the crown

[Verse 3]
Angels have free will too
They not God's yes people
Forced to say "You got it will do!"
They can defy but they know their lives
Is a sure-fire way to fall away from the sky
So as real as I am in my songs
I am a man that can stand to say damn it I'm wrong
It's being real
People feel I need to chill
Burn some weed drink some tea
And have some pizza, still
I sit still
Not me, I mean the word "still"
On an earthquake, see how the world feels
And when it comes back speechless
I will ask you to tell me every last one of your secrets
I reach in my soul to fight my inner insecurities
And we both get strong with each beating
Putting together all the pieces, believe it
I don't want eternal happiness, I need it

[Hook]
If I could be a fly on the wall
To hear what you really think about me
I wouldn't be flying at all
Believe what you believe about me
I just live how I live
Forget how I live
My angels come back and hold me down
Then my angels come back and lift me up
And remind me that I do deserve the crown
