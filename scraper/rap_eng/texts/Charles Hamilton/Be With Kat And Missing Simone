[Intro]
I used to make fun of myself, to say I can’t sing
Number one
Number 2 Kat Stacks is god
With such being said

[Verse 1]
All I earned is now gone
All I have is a song
Sick of being treated wrong
I’ll be with Kat, I’ll be with Kat
Everyone gets along
Dying as you say I’m wrong
Crying as you smile along
I’ll be with Kat, no coming back
Eyes full of blood
Life full of love
Try and give up
Die for the love
Of music
Listeners all remain clueless
Ask me for more
I have to endure
Mad you enjoy all my sadness and boredom but
I will create again and again
Time with my divine girlfriend
Uh

[Verse 2]
All I earned is now gone
All I have is a song
Sick of being treated wrong
I’ll be with Kat, I’ll be with Kat
Everyone gets along
Dying as you say I’m wrong
Crying as you smile along
I’ll be with Kat, no coming back
Did you laugh when I fell?
Did you smile when you saw me in hell?
Am I mad because you can’t tell?
If I passed
Only time can tell
Through time you’ll know
I’ll know but, you’ll know like I will know
I just want to sleep with Simone
All I earned is now gone
All I have is a song
Sick of being treated wrong
I’ll be with Kat, I’ll be with Kat

[Verse 3]
Everyone gets along
Dying as you say I’m wrong
Crying as you smile along
I’ll be with Kat, no turning back
No turning back
No coming back
Because I’ll be with Kat, I’ll be with Kat
Should have asked for me back, asked for me back
Will I ever see Simone again?
Will I ever see Simone again?
(tears)
Will I (sniff) ever see Simone Again?
Everything I had is gone
All my friend say I’m wrong
I don’t know if I’ll be living long
So I’ll be with Kat, I’ll be with Kat
