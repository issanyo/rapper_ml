(Intro) It's only appropriate if I say: A-HAH!

[Verse 1]
Think it's time that I lost my mind and spit that gangsta shit
I feel fine I got piece of mind and I'm chillin' with my gangsta bitch
I'm a grown man I ain't gotta hold hands, you a baby that can make a fist
And plenty bad hoes wanna gimme dat though you got lotion in a handkerchief
Gotta a kitty cat soft but she really mad though cuz I won't let her taste the di...
And her man is a lame can't stand a nigga name so I treat him like jadakiss
Kiss my ass goodbye
I'm leavin'
I am not grievein'
Mind if I stop the nonsense I'm seizin'
Two! On the flavor of love bringin' New York back
But the game is delicious tell her to fall back

[Hook]
Say my name and I'll appear (niggas call me beetlejuice)
This ain't rap, this is beat abuse from the one and only beetlejuice
So many different women wanna sit on my linen (but they can't get the beetlejuice)
That's why they call me beetlejuice so muthafucka call me beetlejuice

[Verse 2]
Now there are alot of rappers that I really don't like
They prayin' to a ghost cause' they really don't write
They tryn'a get high but they philly won't light
So I spit the crack to make lilies go white
Lilies on ya casket bastard
Protect the pot
The only way that you'll be next to Pac (stretch your wig)
Only way that you'll be next to Big (get the gun)
Only way that you'll be next to Pun (test my aim)
You might be next to Game, still alive but niggas tryn'a forget your name
Even the beat said wow
You better bow, ya little meathead now
Did you catch the subliminal?
Charlie Sandiego no catching the criminal
Niggas know
Sickest flow
I got that
You could see my crack words, Call it eye contact

[Hook]
