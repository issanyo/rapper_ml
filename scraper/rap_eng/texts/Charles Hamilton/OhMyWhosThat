[Verse 1]
DAMN!
It seems like she came from
It seems like she came from, (nowhere)
Where she get her name from, (nowhere)
Where she get that frame from, (somewhere)
Her face is a virgin's dance absurd
The circumstances I flirt and chance hurt with her
Her body is pattern like Saturn I'm after the chance to circle her
And her pants
Her clothing line is called, (nowhere)
Is she naked lets not, (go there)
My fiancee from the beyond
I lean on the day she's the lady that cling on (Klingon*)
I'm Captain Kirk because C is always hurt
But today I see her and say okay
Her medial play when we stay seated in space
Each day is a reason we lay

[Hook]
And she wildin cause she got a whole lot of alone time
Damn she wildin cause she got a whole lot of alone time
Take a min, take a min with your play thing
Take a min, take a min with your play thing (oh my move that right there)
Take a min, take a min with your play thing (oh my move that right there)
Take a min, take a min with your play thing (oh my move that right there)

[Verse 2]
When we met I slept on her blanket
As she awoke I gladly spoke like
Good morning my soaring blueprint of a phonix
Her ass is a cruise ship and I'm the iceberg
Blinded by her smile can't find the right words
She's flaunting that cake
Daunting is the task that waits
Wanting to ask if we can make what my first sight felt
But she won't first night hype so I melt
In my seat watching NBC she's watching me
Her company stop breathing we either watching stock drop
Or she got hot get into me listing to this beat
Mutual desire unusual requirement beauty is her island
I swoon with mild tiredness and tenderness as we lock eyes
And I wish it was safe for me enter her lenses

[Hook]
And she wildin cause she got a whole lot of alone time
Damn she wildin cause she got a whole lot of alone time
Take a min, take a min with your play thing
Take a min, take a min with your play thing (oh my move that right there)
Take a min, take a min with your play thing (oh my move that right there)
Take a min, take a min with your play thing (oh my move that right there)

[Verse 3]
Damn
Is it her soul that I love or her
Is it her soul that I love or her (body)
She said she loves my work of (body)
I don't wanna treat her like she's just any (body)
I tuch plenty women but this just isn't a (body)
That got me seeing digital plasma squares
Wish I could visit her ass any where
Get in a cab kiss her fast
Picture stairs?? trippin when I get there
Lips prepared for the kisses
She hold me like I'm her bride
Soo deep but I slide inside a cold sleep
The understands one she is only that
Reservation can't hold me back
So relax, and just let me hold you
As I seen this before

[Hook]
And she wildin cause she got a whole lot of alone time
Damn she wildin cause she got a whole lot of alone time
Take a min, take a min with your play thing
Take a min, take a min with your play thing (oh my move that right there)
Take a min, take a min with your play thing (oh my move that right there)
Take a min, take a min with your play thing (oh my move that right there)
