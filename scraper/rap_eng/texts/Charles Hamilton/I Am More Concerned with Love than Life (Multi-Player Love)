[Produced by Charles Hamilton]

[Verse 1]
I'm standing in this booth as if I see you in front of me
Cause I need you in front of me
I don't need to be in the company
Of people who just wanna be in pocket
Cause they know what's in my pocket
I got it, a lot of riches
And a lot of bitches only acknowledge the kid
Cause they wish to be swallowing kids
For a lot of the business
That I can possibly provide
And I don't wanna die
Unless it's right by your side
By your right side or your left side
It's best I
Let you know that I refuse to crash like Left Eye
No Disrespect I
Mean only the best but why even lie?
I need you right by my side

[Pre-hook]
It's the way You make me feel babe
It's the way You make me feel babe
It's the way You make me feel babe
So listen carefully to the sound

[Hook]
I hate to play you but I'm good at this game
So don't worry. Don't worry
And I'm Afraid that you'll Never be the Same
So don't hurry. So don't hurry, but
All I wanna do is tell you that I love you
When we first get a chance to be alone
When we first get a chance to be alone
When we first get a chance to be alone

[Verse 2]
So my Secrets seem asinine
Thats because I spend half my time
Reflecting how you've gotten into my Glass mind
I only seem to think about you as the past time
So to pass time, I just polish the glass. Why?
I just wanna see you clearer, feel you nearer
This is why when I look in the mirror
I don't see nothing but
What you should expect
What the fuck?
This is not just your neck that I wanna get
I want to run this shit with you
You should be the queen
The Captain of the team
And You know what I mean
Exactly. When I lean on a mirror
Look at the reflection, it's cause I can feel you in my direction
The other side looks like my mothers side
The inside, I'm so used to living in it
Only for a couple months as a youth
Then I exit it. Now let's get it

[Hook]
I hate to play you but I'm good at this game
So don't worry. Don't worry
And I'm Afraid that you'll Never be the Same
So don't hurry. So don't hurry, but
All I wanna do is tell you that I love you
When we first get a chance to be alone
When we first get a chance to be alone
When we first get a chance to be alone

[Verse 3]
Now I Know I've probably said the same thing before
I just wanna bring you more
Of what's going on
I can sing you more
Melodies and harmonies
But instead I would rather be the heavenly armor
That you would carry with you wherever you go
When there's people on you
Like marijuana smoke
You wanna get high
But the odor won't let you get by
So you just drift by
Listen and get a whiff of my
Cologne it's so natural
And I Have to know it's no hassle
"No, it's No hassle."
With a "K" and
I lay in the day
Maybe the day's end, and a daze in
From looking at your eyes in a gaze
At me, so amazing
I use words as I play 'em that's what I'm saying
Maybe this conversation's a PlayStation
No more talkin', vacation

[Intermission]
I wanna tell you I love you really bad
I gotta know it's mutual
And I wanna greet you with I love you
Dead ass
Charles Hamilton
Seems like I was born to love

[Outro]
