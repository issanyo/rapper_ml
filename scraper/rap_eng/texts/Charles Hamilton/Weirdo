They keep telling me I'm crazy
I honestly don't believe I'm crazy
Maybe I think too much but..
Crazy? Naahh

[Verse 1]
I woke up in the body of a video game
Is that really so strange? Do you really know my name?
I'm the picture of imagination coming to life
Am I gonna do right? Am I running tonight?
(Where the hell am I going?)

[Hook]
You must think I'm some kind of weirdo, I bet you do
Yes you do, only makes sense when I'm next to you
You must think I'm some kind of weirdo, I bet you do
Yes you do, only makes sense when I'm next to you

[Verse 2]
I fall asleep to the sound of your every last fear
I look at every last tear, and I say sit your heavy ass here
I don't cry cause my body feels like it's too dry
Maybe I am too high. I think I need a new high (new high)

[Hook]
You must think I'm some kind of weirdo, I bet you do
Yes you do, only makes sense when I'm next to you
You must think I'm some kind of weirdo, I bet you do
Yes you do, only makes sense when I'm next to you

[Verse 3]
Move if you wanna, move, ya'll gotta
Do ya'll ride in the groove I'm outta?
I do. Surf on the track, blurting the facts
While you hurting the rap
No pain, no gain, no gain
If you can't see broke like Rogaine
Something like a guitar with no gain
I'm way too smooth for distortion
You can call me your music catortionist
I make it fit, flex, this next
It is in just laps of distress
I have fun thinking outside the box
About time you watch me ride the clock
A few seconds left and I cruise like a jet
My music's the best, something that you never get

[Hook]
You must think I'm some kind of weirdo, I bet you do
Yes you do, only makes sense when I'm next to you
You must think I'm some kind of weirdo, I bet you do
Yes you do, only makes sense when I'm next to you
You must think I'm some kind of weirdo, I bet you do
Yes you do, only makes sense when I'm next to you
You must think I'm some kind of weirdo, I bet you do
Yes you do, only makes sense when I'm next to you
