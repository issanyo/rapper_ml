I got too much on my mind to get top. So mind the top. My mind got a lot of shots from people who USED TO mind the top. A lot of love has been given. A lot of love has been lost, but love is in the rhythm. I guess it's a love song. It could be a "roll-up-bud-and-get-your-puff-on" kind of song, but now I'm kinda wrong. 'Cause I don't get high no more. At least not from weed. Don't try to copy me. The worst influence. A virgin with music. But I get it in. Barry White style. Very right, right now. Lights out. Right now. I'm on the mic. Wow

I can see you in the daylight
But that's the only time you play right
So now it's too late
Don't try to make it right
Because it's too late
I see you

I gave niggas the world, they expected slavery again. Just a page for me to vent about. It's crazy how we living now. And I'm still living *down*. Niggas say I gotta start getting down. Well I was in the bitch's mouth in your house! Nigga, now! And then I went to visit that OTHER chump, and all he wanna do is fuck and hump! And then some other chump tried to cross me and now he's calling me his darling... fuck all y'all niggas! Every last one of y'all suck! Get my balls up, puke get tossed up by people who know how awesome this whole shit could be, and there's no history for Hov and them niggas who been dissin me. Said it clear. Extra clear. Get to me

I can see you in the daylight
But that's the only time you play right
So now it's too late
Don't try to make it right
Because it's too late
I see you

I need a buddy system for the niggas who been patting my back and saying I should be in love with them. All y'all should get together. Hold hands. Say a prayer. 'Cause I'm a fuckin' nightmare! Hard to explain. Hard to exclaim! Hard to talk about all the blame... Hard to even call me to blame. Yo. It's hard. And I repeated myself. So broad, get on your job! Mad difficult to rap nowadays, but these cats act difficult with cats on the haze. They shouldn't be high to begin with. Leave weed to me. That makes me a dope sentence maker. The greatest. Fuckin' hater. And in my world, I'm the creator. My mother died, my father's on the other side, and I just wanna fuckin' vibe

I can see you in the daylight
But that's the only time you play right
So now it's too late
Don't try to make it right
Because it's too late
I see you
