Verse 1:

Yo

The things I would do to save those who in my family
Not even being comical, I already know lil dude
What you goin' through niggas thinking about killing you
They not feeling you, still i'm with you
Which is the biggest issue;
I could lose all my family fortune and fame
But damn, can we get away from this scorching game
Ya know, saving your life your name isn't right it's Ryan
Damn I can't be denying all this shit I been trying to keep you safe
Wait, if I even think about it this shit is a "hey"
And you been embarrassing; even my face
So I try to stay away from it all
Like play a drum and then call me... later

Chorus:

Some places I don't want to go but I do
Just to appeal to you
Some people I don't wanna' know but I do
Can I keep it real for you

Verse 2:

Know yourself if you feel your unable to control yourself
And the problem is, I don't hold a belt to whip you
But back to that being the issue, you need to be raised
Sick of being played I understand
But this is me nowadays
I am your older cousin older brother
No one wants to discuss what is upper
But fuck it, grandma needs you
Look at the shit you feed her
And, look at what's going on in speakers
I am the one that could beat you
And i'm trying to raise you
Not trying play you
Trying to save you
Not violate you
But you letting niggas hit: sentences
Me speaking them shitz
Let em win

Chorus:

Verse 3:

I been caught, I been beat, look at this shit
Look at what goes on in these streets
Some shit that goes on in these sheets
And these niggas got the nerve to call it "deep"
And it bothers me too cuz' that shit could happen to me
Cuz you father the deepest move
And you have been a victim of it
So don't sit in public go somewhere distant
And love the distance between niggas and me
The problem is niggas indeed are who's feeding me
Now who's the nigga?
You were the trigger
You could get blasted, nigga
You should figure it out
By yourself
Try yourself
Ryan help i'm dying inside of helping you

Chorus:
