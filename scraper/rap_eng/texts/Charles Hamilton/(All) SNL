[Intro]
What's wrong baby? You can't breathe?
I'm Chucking you?

[Verse 1]
Load up and let go, a drive by
IPod felon, that fly of a guy
Check the stocks, thinking of buying the sky
Perhaps a merger with a galactical server
Online on high, strong NASDAQ
Defensive questions leave me at NASA
Niggas kiss they teeth like... cause I'm they Massa
Hijack a mask on the pastors daughter
While she get mad cause I'm past being past her
Tap her, showed her how to be a bad one
Not to beat her ass, she got it bad son
And I'm the one that could make her wanna have one
So the pastor send the bishops to hit me
Niggas is iffy, quick to diss me
I skip to Ma Loum, grip the rock, lose them
Shake em out of they shoes
Touch the floor, right the left
Ankle hurting, darn it
Perfect warming up the perfect storm, warning
Certain to bomb a person flirting with harming the harmony
My word is bond while you..."Working on it!"
Turn the volume up to 10CC
Tenchi dreams begin to read deep
Convincing the senses to go against me
So I can go in
Make em wanna sit with me

[Hook]
Kill em with the niceness
Kill em with the niceness
Kill em with the niceness
Kill em with the niceness

Cause I love it when you kill me
Gotta love it when I kill you

You take a L if you miss
But follow the curve and end up with a kiss

[Verse 2]
Get your eye popped for acting like Bruno
Savage like a sumo appetite but you already knew though
Not sumo diet cause..."You know!"
I mean my diet requires eating yokozuna and some doodle-o's
Only my noodle knows what could make my music grow
Flowers and seeds when I overpower a beat
So natural, but... wait
So natural and is the only other word that could stand
So natural and so secure
No need to go to sleep, think Omen 4
What you think my heart be O-in for?
Oh! When I claim the throne of hearts, focused
And that was me using my hands as a plumber
Going deep in this shit, face like a plunger
Tastes quite wonderful, no one can assault me
I'm in the booth, just in case you're talking of OB(?)
By the way, I'm so Nick like Nalty
And you wonder why I love to rap offbeat
My delivery is rivaled by Build-A-Bear
CPS, call me a chillionaire
Give chills to the air, phantom of the ozone
Tell Hamilton to go home
Then I'mma fart, the memory remains
I drop the illest shit, that was visceral and strange

[Hook]
Kill em with the niceness
Kill em with the niceness
Kill em with the niceness
Kill em with the niceness

Cause I love it when you kill me
Gotta love it when I kill you

You take a L if you miss
But follow the curve and end up with a kiss
