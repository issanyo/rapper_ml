[Verse 1]
The vaginalist goddess
Monologues of awkward promises
Her mind was lost tryna decide between Diana Ross and vitamins
Diva or a needer (Anita) of more fever from the board-demon speaking more heat than a whore eating pork seasoned with your fingertips....
Touch it deep inside and she arrives leaving eyes bleeding
Only I have seen the deepest height her thighs can bring a guy
Tried to beat and only got a "Mind to speak?"
A timeless freak!
Guidance I need when riding through the streets with a dime that's not defined by the least.. She's cost provoken....
Walking lonely through the halls of homies zoning off and hoping to be poking the queen for better thoughts...
Hold me, she thinks
Groaning in sync with chrome posted
Frozen in heat, beating the bones of old speech
It's time she elevated her sequence in rhyme
Never a favorite of weaklings, this whole weekend is her's

[Hook]
She can walk
She can dance!
She can be whatever if you give her a chance!
*Who is she?*
*Laughs*
*What is she, to you??*
*Laughs*

[Verse 2]
She keeps her prescriptions of secrets and afflictions in-between the scriptures of her picture book
Get a look at this
Doctor told her take a brake
She opted to throw the break away and use the prescription paper as paperweights!
Wind could make her float if her flow wasn't major. So she stays atop the paper to keep the wasted paper from blowing
A frugal slut but rude to love as if she blew it up!
Detonated her mannerisms and dedicated her grammar to levitating with the Hamilton record break when it's handed for letting the break breakaway is outlandish!
Kit Kat when a track is lip smacking delicious, for instance this track is flipping ridiculous!!
And this bitch has the wick and the lit match to hit the dispatcher with patterns of ember!!!
Temper, Temper says the tenth of November
Lower the ember, descendants of the coldest winter......

[Hook]
She can walk
She can dance!
She can be whatever if you give her a chance!
*Who is she?*
*Laughs*
*What is she, to you??*

[Verse 3]
Her menstrual cycle is suspenseful to a psycho but in the defense of the mic whose life I'm ending tonight it's simple
Symbols and rides of guys tricking they life to be the bride getter of the bitch whose riddle is inside..
Get between her thighs, interesting..
She's a guy, get between her mind's lines you'll see she's a dying blonde!
But reading too deep into that line is a time-bomb
Too late for that, I may in fact have signed on
Here's a case for the wack: Fear is facing the back, which means I face the future
Seems I'm taking the abuse..
To do what may confuse the awakening of the rude
Stay in school baby, detention is basically cool!
Don't mention it lady, it's school
I hear it
Perhaps me flipping the middle is a demerit?
Or perhaps such behavior is headlights that are deerless
Connecting with the people is a near miss........

[Hook]
She can walk
She can dance!
She can be whatever if you give her a chance!
*Who is she?*
*What is she, to you??*
