[Hook]
All this music and all these lights
I just wanna be with you
After I dance with you
I just want to leave with you
All this music and all these lights
I just wanna be with you
After I dance with you
I just want to leave with you

[Verse 1]
This ciroc has hit the spot
I grip the knot that's in my pocket
I don't spend a lot but after ten shots
I'm the disco king of hip hop
Take me on and [?]
I'm drunk and this here is my favorite song
Only a hater could make this wrong
Is it because I'm faded and gone or is it [?]

Baby, just sway along
I can't hear words so I play along
Maybe I'm wrong but the waves are strong
Walk this way, won't wait for long
This the type of track to get naked on
Let's break away from the fog
This night is miraculous
We are after lust
Love is after us, come on

[Hook]
All this music and all these lights
I just wanna be with you
After I dance with you
I just want to leave with you
All this music and all these lights
I just wanna be with you
After I dance with you
I just want to leave with you

[Verse 2]
This beat is giving me reason
To keep [?] I dove off the deep end
You a lady I want to befriend
I want to say more but I want to stay decent
Baby can we get, so left that we give seven days to the weekend
I got so many secrets
Dance floor, pillow talk when we reachin'
Your whining, I see it
Your body is a season, I get weakened
The bass in the subs got me tweaking
Let's awake in this club with this sweet kiss
My fault I'm ahead of myself
I'm looking at your eyes so you read what I felt
I'm cheating on you with you
Because eye contact what we used to do

Baby just sway along
I can't hear words so I play along
Maybe I'm wrong, but the waves are strong
Walk this way, won't wait for long
This the type of track to get naked on
Let's break away from the fog
This night is miraculous
We are after lust
Love is after us, come on


[Hook]
All this music and all these lights
I just wanna be with you
After I dance with you
I just want to leave with you
All this music and all these lights
I just wanna be with you
After I dance with you
I just want to leave with you

Let's go
[Hook]

[Outro]
All this music and all these light...
After I dance with you...
All this music and all these light...
After I dance with you
I just want to leave with you
