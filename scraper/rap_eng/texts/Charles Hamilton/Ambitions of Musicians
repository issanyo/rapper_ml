[Verse 1: Charles Hamilton]
Live today like tomorrow homie just earn money
Hip hop ain't die man it just turned 20
Ambitions of musicians, im Thelonious Monk
Mixed with a lil' punk, for the homies to bump
I am not a lil' punk for the homies to jump
I'm Scarface smoking blunts while im holding the pump
So many hoes know me, I know what they want
But im Bobby at Knight, so I choke her for fun
Better yet Sprewell when Im choking the coach
You know that the flow is dope
So dont even front
You better say that im the truth when I open my mouth
Im a ghost and thats why I got so many styles
Nigga Pac won't leave me alone he keep haunting me
Taunting me, I ask him what the hell you want from me
He said nothing I just need some new company
These other rappers still sounding kinda dumb to me
So... Don't be scared if ever you think I grab at ya
I know its creepy, so what?... "I ain't mad at cha"
This is written but off the top im the mad hatter
A bad boy, no wonder I see the Mad Rappers
All I gotta do is spray em' with Mase
They just pimples im Noxzema, they won't stay in my face
They got alot of opinions they won't say to my face
I treat em' like Bush do Mexicans, Stay in yo place
Im pink so why would I stay in a race?
But I black and these niggas can't stay in the race
Im a beast, catch me bathing with apes
Riding with lions, why are you lying, playa ya gay
If you try to throw me a curve, im making it straight
Shorty try to throw me her curves, I stay getting laid
Im a cute pink carpet, I stay in her place
And graffiti with the semen when I spray in her face
Using racial terms, Im the ace of the spades
Loon of the Coons, more money for the porch monkeys
I stack figures translation im that nigga
Rap sicker then ALL of you rap niggas
I pop alot of shit, that much is obvious
Im only nice with the wrapping cause I got a gift
And your pockets need Axe, it ain't got a scent
Im pretty set in my ways so why I gotta dip?
Ya'll lukewarm and I am your father prick
No catholic priest, get off your fathers dick
You pussies just love giving a lot of lip
Well im abstinent, thats why you ain't got a hit
I ain't stupid, I paint lucid pictures
I make moves like that Frank Lucas nigga
Should've been in the March on Washington
But im a king, so March on Washington
This is my year, from March on watch the kid
This that real chronic, go head you can spark it get lit
This track is the looseleaf I was born to rip
I make it rain like Storm in a porno flick
Made her leave her X man and get it on with him
Call Michael Buffer motherfucker, get it on with him
No homo but you niggas climbing Brokeback Mountain
Im so crack, you sold that? I hope that found em'
This is the product my nigga no backcounting
You ain't speaking English, you the pope, thats wildin'
You pop E and think you leading the faith
Well im a can of Red Bull, I can keep em' awake
I invest time in music, I guess I need more money
Until then November 10ths the new 4 20
So roll up and get a hit of the piff
Or buy yourself a Nixon lollipop and lick on a dick BITCH!!!
And I fucked up and im keeping it... ONE!!!
