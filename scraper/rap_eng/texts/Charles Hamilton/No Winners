You're my bride by my side I'ma look you in your eye. I beg you to leave me surprised. Matter fact, lead to my demise. As a matter of fact BE my surprise. John Nintendo with Charles Hamilton. I got to get dough. Y'all can't handle the phlegm when I spit it out. Niggas stay trying to figure out my clout.  I understand such but when I stand up that means it's time for you to man up. I am the man, what!? You disagree? You dissing me? What is listening to, B? I've been inspiring you. At the same time retiring you. I'm tired of you. I'ma do what I do and if you want to ride with, it's still my shit

There are no winners in the war of love, I hope you understand me now
There are no winners in the war of love, there is only family now
So let's do it like this...

The way that I move with a suicidal twist has people moving out of their crib, trying to figure out where I live so they can give me a little lift. I dig it. But my mission is to wake up a man who needs his whole shit broken up.  Broke up. I woke up and spoke such. I gotta cope with enough of it, the dopest stuff that I spit I elope with the baddest and toughest bitch. Folks know that my focus is cuffing shit, cutting my wrist, just to get a tough of bliss.  But is it enough for me, especially when I'm rapping publicly? Stuck with me is the public, you see? And I'ma lead them to you, your "venue."

I've reached a stage beyond doubt, beyond it. I'm honest when I say what I'm about. SEGA IS WHAT I'M ABOUT. But lady, later for all of that doubting shit. The mountain I dig is bigger than everything that I've lifted in the past. I want to kick it in it's ass. I wish the nigga would crash at my place so he would realize it's not safe. The demons that travel with me'a probably  grab for his kidney, snatch it out, have a sip, pass it back to him without having a doubt. Rap is now nasty zound on my wrist, I like it. But it's become the sickest drum for a victim that's pretty dumb
