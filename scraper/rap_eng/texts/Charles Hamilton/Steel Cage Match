All I'm asking for is love from above. All the Divine, it stays on my mind all of the time. So the divinity has to ride with me while I climax in the industry. Trying to get it's soul out, no doubt. All I do is go out with a couple of bad hoes and they show me how I should roll around the whole town. And the town in particular now is vehicular homicide for niggas who are lyrical enough to try to ride on the side of the guy trying to figure it out, with a bounce. Hilarious as it amounts to, but this beat has a bounce too. So go ahead and bounce to it
As it ends up a mountain of one of my fits

I'm all out of emotion, I am full of rage
I am out of emotion, I am full of rage
So if you want to see me, see me in a cage

All I have to do is figure out how to get love from you then I've had enough of you. I had the public stuck with me and now the public is fucking you. You know who I'm talking to, you're moving in my direction with your violent questions. I kinda get it but I had beckoned something that requires a crescent from the sky. Don't let it try to lessen you but don't question it because it can mess with you. Awesome as it seems to remain the guy who stays fly and hangs by the side of the sky. As cool as it is to still rule because the rubric is to feel you. And I still feel the rudeness in me letting me know I should end thee, but continue

I'm all out of emotion, I am full of rage
I am out of emotion, I am full of rage
So if you want to see me, see me in a cage

I had to get my Kanye on, which means that I'm kinda strong
I can take all kinds of pain as long as I'm in the game and I got people crying when they're singing my refrains, hook choruses. More of it, the force lives on at least while I can proportionately get thee to listen to me. See, it's a little too deep to not be into me. But you're into Johnny - That's kind of my beef. A lot people ride with me but they don't understand it, i.e., kind of the flight I speak behind the mic I eat. But it's not a vagina and I'm not a minor so why don't I sleep

I'm all out of emotion, I am full of rage
I am out of emotion, I am full of rage
So if you want to see me, see me in a cage
