It kinds feels like I'm never good. Try to keep a positive mind, I never could. That's why I never put faith in myself but instead my hood. At least there I know the head is good. Both my mind and the mind of dimes that's trying to get a dime. Either to get high or buy designer.  So I just sit back in my recliner, happy that it's not hard for me to find vagina. And sad because I only trust a woman if I buy vagina. I mean, it comes with a receipt and piece of mind: Hey, she wanted me to beat. As well as depressing, look at the company I keep. It really is something to be weak, but strong enough to admit that you're lunching on your feet. God damned shame that I have to get drunk to go to sleep. Sound uncomfortable to me, how about you?

Everyday I see your face when pass. I hate when I have to pass you. But I wait because the date has yet to make greatness (AKA the day we start dating) happen. Exactly. Either I'm too deep in the zone or I need to be alone for now. Nah, I think I'm tweaking for now. But let me explain why I think I'm leaping off the deep end. Each dime piece I would be in I would leave them. Because in the end I will leave them if you tell me you wish to begin. Even if the chick is the sweetest. Kiss her personality this is an instance in which I have to say "Look, Miss. You were a casualty. Don't feel bad for me." Too many moves to choose from. Besides, I do it for you. Now, baby, let's do what it do. Who knew

Me like it. I can't lie, it makes me feel some kind of way when you smiling at me. For me to let you down would be a gift to give away. And it would be quiet for me. And that's how it happens. Baby what's cracking? I ain't trying to waste no time. Because coast to coast I will float to you that there's no limit if you're mine

Your eyes steady talking, and you're tryna fight it
But some things, baby, are not worth hiding, And we can find heaven if we can work together
So won't, won't you tell me, and get it off your chest
