Yo, tell me how you feel now, is it real now? Let me know if you’re still down not like Pac but I’m the Psych-Pac, Psych doctor like USA. But I got my words and I rock with them. Got a warm leatherette, it’s a hot rhythm. And in porn I can bet I’m a hot nigga. But I only have one actress on my mattress. So watch this nigga, instead of what I do with my chick, musical she’s some Suicide chick. Dark orange now, some do or die shit. And we on now so who you ride with? Who can you vibe with? This the style I give when I don’t wanna give a shit. And it’s the shit. So I’m not giving myself. You either get it for free or never get it yourself

Now you see me, now you don’t
Now you see me, now you don’t
Now you see me, now you don’t
Now you see me, now you don’t
Whether or cold you still can’t see me in my leather
Whether or cold you still can’t see me in my leather

I shocked the game and I still look better than all these niggas who need a good look forever. I don’t need a co-sine or tangent . I’m just throwing a tantrum, god damnit. H-A-M-I-Til, the hottest nigga in the brothel. Bag a bitch walk out until I say so. And ain’t nobody rocking my way so. Please accept the mistake I made and let it still be a fresh breath everyday. I’m having fun these rappers can’t say the same thing. They all mad at me because they say the same thing. And I stay in the name ring the hottest name you could ring And my name rings bells, what the hell. Hottest shit you ever heard, ever. And I gotta get better than that being clever

Now you see me, now you don’t
Now you see me, now you don’t
Now you see me, now you don’t
Now you see me, now you don’t
Whether or cold you still can’t see me in my leather
Whether or cold you still can’t see me in my leather

Damnit, I’m hot but don’t amp it. If I decide to gamble, I gambit, It’s my stop. My deck. So therefore my respect, and matter of fact leave the cash, give me checks. Yeah, go darker than the first check
And you end up with a birth check. Hurt? Yes. Of course it hurts to be this fucking gorgeous. But there’s no more love for the dude who loves gore. I love keeping it dark, keeping it simple. But since I’m keeping it dark niggas are temperamental on my instrumentals. Wishing mad shit was simple. But my demo was harder than half these niggas mixtape and all these niggas albums, so sit straight. See who can dictate the entire Tri-State or the Tryst-ate, depends on if your bitch hate

Now you see me, now you don’t
Now you see me, now you don’t
Now you see me, now you don’t
Now you see me, now you don’t
Whether or cold you still can’t see me in my leather
