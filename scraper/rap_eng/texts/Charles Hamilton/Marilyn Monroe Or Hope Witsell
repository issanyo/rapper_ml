[Verse 1]
An actress with posazz and a fat lip
From getting mad at the status of a bad chick
Who got casted, in a flick shes been asking to get
Since the passing of the script as she imagined
Unhappy she fastened her arm with the jumper cord
And plunges forth, OD on life she don't want no more
But not pumping raw up in her pores
She wants to pour sweat, run to the set, fuck the corvet
Of course the press n paparazzi was watching
But she got stiff, now its time to get it popping
Started taking box in to prepare for her last film
But the crictics spazzed, said it was a bad film
Her dad is filth rich, her mom don't feel shit
So she sits still, the past tent of Jada pickets man
Cash n depression is ever lasting in this section of America
Lights, camera, action, Hysteria

[Hook]
You are a movie star
And the walk of fame is your every foot step,(x3)
Be my Marilyn Monroe (x8)

[Verse 2]
I knew this was going on cause she had me on speaker
Nothing like an unhappy strong diva
Who is about to be madder when shes on the set
Hope she don't find out that its the blonde i sexed
Wrong guess is the premeditated reply
We was separated baby, see, you ca- uh, i kept making you cry
Now look, wait, we ain't even there yet
She wouldn't care either, shes a fair diva
But shes madder than i ever took a gander at
Had to bottle up too, so i know she planning to black
She said its not the role, its the principal
I shit i know, but yo, you not invincible
She said can it baby! this is revenge
Let me see this fucking director, this is the end!
And that bitch is gonna have a shit eating grin
I know she be giving it to him, but damn im a ten

[Hook]
You are a movie star
And the walk of fame is your every foot step,(x3)
Be my Marilyn Monroe (x8)

[Outro]
I rode my bike to rodayo drive, tryna stay alive
85 degrees in the shade, its major hot
Waving high to the fans to keep cool
I been a people person since before pre-school
My girl text me..
Said shes cool, but she was too smooth with it
I gave her like two minutes, no reply
Then i got google notified, oh my
