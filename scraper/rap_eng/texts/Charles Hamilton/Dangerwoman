I looked her in her eyes when we first met. Surprised it wasn't the birth. Died in her eyes but, fuck it, this is just a verse. I have to adjust the verse to her thighs, she was so beautiful. But to adjust to her eyes, then I would have to want to bust inside. She told me the look in her is lust. And lust leads to trouble and trouble leads to trust. You trust the trouble that you're in, so double the event. Don't give a fuck what you're in. You're in a pot, stewing. The pot's brewing. No pot for you, you're Patrick Ewing. 33 from New York, it's a six. Dirty me, running this sport with a crucifix. Sticks, like a badger. No father, like a bastard

When I look into her eyes, she says I won't survive
When I listen to her cry, she says I won't survive
When I listen to her lies, she says I won't survive
As long as she's with me, I know I won't survive

I don't write anymore, it takes too much time. Time is money and they say I ain't on my grind. I stay on my grind. Never could kickflip, so I play with you guys. Rolling around on the vert. Picking up dirt, but holding the sound. Ka-coon! Ka-coon! Ka-coon! Whenever I spit to you coons it's the truth. Niggas do what it do, like Ray. But Ray had to do what he do with the ray from the Sun. So the light ray I may spit, basically could guide your way through the Matrix. Blinded, seeing Ray, seeing people stay. But it's machinery, OK? Teana leaves, dropping speech. If you're not as heat, then get Dr. King

When I look into her eyes, she says I won't survive
When I listen to her cry, she says I won't survive
When I listen to her lies, she says I won't survive
As long as she's with me, I know I won't survive

I'm heartbroken like John Q. Heart broken like John Q's Son. But I'm like John Q when I rob you, son. Because I need my son to provide for who? Dangerwoman. The woman that stays a woman even when she plays like she's coming. Hit it from behind, ladies seek. Interest you in her mind. I understand her behind. I want to be the guy standing behind. I think my mind is interesting enough. And I ain't even pimping the chick, I really think we're in love. Different kind of feeling for us. Nothing is appealing to us. Trying to keep it real. Got feelings to touch with a blade. With my babe. The real get-up

When I look into her eyes, she says I won't survive
When I listen to her cry, she says I won't survive
When I listen to her lies, she says I won't survive
As long as she's with me, I know I won't survive
