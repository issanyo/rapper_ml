Its like another way of seeing Our love
Letting all the pain in Memory Revolve(Yes you are)
Who can you blame for all my Resistance
Lights shine through Together


How much can You take before you give It up
How much can You take before you give It up

[I keep hearing all the voices(Yes you are)]

How much can You take before you give It up
How much can You take before you give It up
How much can You take before you give It up
How much can You take before you give It up
How much can You take before you give It up
How much can You take before you give It up
[And I don't know what the sound of joy is but this ain't it, I can bet, Unless]


I gotta get used to the sound Of happiness
Its the sound Of happiness
I gotta get used to the sound Of happiness
I gotta get used to the sound Of happiness
Its the sound Of happiness
I gotta get used to the sound Of happiness


What does It take to even Take a break to breath and Awake
You sleep enough to go to space and reach ladies that wanna be a lady Just one day of the week
Would You say that I'm Tweaking (Yes you are)
Well the lady with the C-H does, So let me give you that CH love
Not that teenage love that make a nigga wanna fight
That Deep space love to make you kiss and want to light
A bunch of incense for the night, While We listening to Mike
Ticklin' you In the position Of which you like
Lickin' On the stitches Of which you've been given life
If you should Give life her Middle name Is midnight
She gotta be this nice, as beautiful as you
As true as any music either me or you can do
Now what me and you can do
Is what I see as beautiful




I gotta get used to the sound Of happiness
Its the sound Of happiness
I gotta get used to the sound Of happiness
I gotta get used to the sound Of happiness
Its the sound Of happiness
I gotta get used to the sound Of happiness




How much can You take before you give It up
How much can You take before you give It up
How much can You take before you give It up
How much can You take before you give It up
How much can You take before you give It up
How much can You take before you give It up
How much can You take before you give It up
How much can You take before you give It up
How much can You take before you give It up
How much can You take before you give It up
How much can You take before you give It up
How much can You take before you give It up
How much can You take before you give It up
How much can You take before you give It up
How much can You take before you give It up
How much can You take before you give It up




I gotta get used to the sound Of happiness
Its the sound Of happiness
I gotta get used to the sound Of happiness
I gotta get used to the sound Of happiness
Its the sound Of happiness
I gotta get used to the sound Of happiness
