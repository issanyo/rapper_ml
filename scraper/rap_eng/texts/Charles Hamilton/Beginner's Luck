[Verse]
Reading National Geographic. Be irrational
See a rapper, be diplomatic, give him a dap and go
Talk sh1t about him after the show
Laugh at his flow, snap on his hoes, and ask him for dough
Fuck 94% of ALL rappers
The other 6% are young and belligerent
The majority is ignorant
So I doubt. So the 94% can live a bit
Me and Eminem share the same sentiments
He thought of dissing Wayne. I thought of dissing him
I swear “We Made You” was a jack from “All Alone“
If it wasn’t? Message! Karl Malone. Marshall!
Hamilton Scotland. The first Mather was John
I don’t mean Stockton
Eminem is black. I’m snitching
Nation of Islam, and Klan members, listen
David Duke plays my music, ‘cause I say the truth!
Radical clues, and facial bruises display the proof
Stupid haters of me? One color
Asians, Cubans, and Haitians learn English to say my music
So you Negroes need to make improvements
I’m a, “You still making music?” away from losing my race, and troopin’ it
I bit my tooth on some STUPID shit
So if I ever bit a bar?
I’m just being lucrative
Meaning, I spend a lot of time on my Wall Street clock
I am the sun. Quite redundant to call me hot
So I overheat when I vent, go to sleep after over-eating
Cannibalistic intent
In a fucking mental ward, due to malicious intent
Fuck my quote, unquote, “Mom”
Someone give her some d*ck, she said, “You only get one mother.”
Well… Find me a stunt double
Her fucking existence, causes blunt trouble
Damn y’all
Can’t talk. Can’t crawl
Stand tall on my hands, and fans call
Stand tall in my Vans, and the law man calls
Is Charles a man, or does my heart have to handle a bra?
Or must I handle my own balls, holler at me, Charles…

[Outro]
… ONE!
WHOO!
… How stupid do I sound?
… Come on
