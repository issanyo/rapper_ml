[Verse 1]
I can't wait till the rodeo stops
And the bullshit I face gets thrown, it don't stop
I show and go no motive loathin my foes
Strokin' the hoes that didn't notice when the dough was so low
Yeah I know I'm so hot, but I gotta chill
I gotta knot at the bottom of my heel
From running shit and I don't wanna heal, wanna feel pain
While I'm runnin' this here game
Give it to me everyone is real strange, to the person that strange, be real
I may be ill but my ways are amazing
Take a vacation I'm layin' with a babe that feels that
I need to be protected by the navy seals
Cause I'm so precious that I may be steal
Well I meant stolen, but when the kid go in
I attack your eardrum, with a Kimbo hit

Loading up the son of a gun
There's a three pound bullet in the sky
Just accept my number as one...
So, please don't pull me from the skyyy

[Verse 2]
If it's all love, cool address any issues directly to me
It's a bless you, and tissue type a transaction, it's just what's right
You like the fan bad shit fuck your life, flame on
My fire melts water when it's not frozen
Not joking, friends say I should stop smoking
I tell them all lick there lips
I got a list of 6 people legitimately I give a shit about
Them niggas figured it out, you violate me, forget it nigga, you out
Smiling faces of those who are on violation
Misery says, finally some people will visit me
So as you sit there, happy as a pig and slop
I live a lot, piss Ciroc into a river of scotch
The drinking water is tainted, and all of you taste it
And all of you hate it, but it's all of your favorite hah

[Verse 3]
Have I polluted your mind with the music of my, beautiful
I do it too many times to myself, to not be felt by the numb brains
Some days I walk around my house getting dumb brain
Until my sheets got cum stains that blend
On the dress of a lady that came to win
Or came when she knew that the game would begin when I came
And I vent about the day that I spent this whole verse
Try to articulate, as smart as I made accept myself to be
I don't respect myself, you see
Cause respect can make his neck come check for me
I'm a check to it, no checks for me
I'm a grown ass man being treated like a f-ing she
Quarantined from this sex disease, it's called love
So fuck it, loathe my existence
I'm still here, goin' the distance
