[Verse 1]
It's not that I don't like anybody
I'm just not like anybody!
And I'm kinda like somebody that doesn't like anybody
And would like anybody to be on top of a spike...
After a bottle of Henny
...
After looking at one's body
...
Three sixes
Meet the Genius of the Geniuses
You don't like me? Suck on decayed and dying penises..
While I clean this shit!
Greenday
Get high, steam away
Let me show you how a Genius plays
While I lay six feet
Beneath
Those who need to decay

[Hook]
This fucking Sega shit is MINE!
You fucking aliens are MINE!!
You fucking ladies... MINE!!!
The kind of fucked up thoughts in my mind
I'm on my own, here we go!

[Verse 2]
I only like sex when my partner is dead
That comes from the heart and the head
If I had sex with you then pardon your death
But I would like to be a part of your breath...
When you take it away, now blow me!
I'm able to say "Come hold me!"
Because like a casket match
I finish you or carry your ass back to the back!
No Paul Bearer
Not even Kane
Just Undertaker in my brain
Rest in it, like Au Revoir!
For the rest of the minute I'll start to...
Wait...
Wait...
MUAH!
Kissing everybody who's dissing me
And you listen to me and you love me!
Just saw the power switch, sh1t gets ugly

[Hook]
This fucking Sega shit is MINE!
You fucking aliens are MINE!!
You fucking ladies... MINE!!!
The kind of fucked up thoughts in my mind
I'm on my own, here we go!

[Verse 3]
I don't like sodomy
I simply like raping people with knives and not offering an apology!
And to be honest, this is the innocent side of me
...
Ever since I am my older cuddin...
*Cousin, fuck it!
I might as well call my older cousin Cudi
Since he was in Cleveland, was inside of me
She say Hi to me
Day and Nite
I play with knives
Then play with myself, later guys!
Sega time!
Break Sega in half so I can see why y'all are gay, then make up my mind
And then rape myself blind
No melon, but hey, it's from behind
This rape of my mind...

[Hook]
This fucking Sega shit is MINE!
You fucking aliens are MINE!!
You fucking ladies... MINE!!!
The kind of fucked up thoughts in my mind
I'm on my own, here we go!
