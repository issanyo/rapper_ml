I'm so official, I'm the potential of "dope". Cold as a Cobra when you mix it with Coke. Hope floats. Time flies. I glide. My right mind is bolder, unsober. Hold it by the broken thread. The action of a sober head. I'm fly with baggage like an overhead. Any sign of crashing and my clothes are wet. I feel fine just SPLASHing. I'm so in bed. Cold sweat breaks. No expectations. Paranoid nap(s). My manhood tries to have the boy back. Pure as the flesh under the breast under a woman's chest. I'm goin' under. But goin' under means going over the best. Trying to get that supernova respect. The dough, hoes and the checks... DROWN you. Guess the ocean is over your neck. Who found you?

Nobody. Nobody
I'll be very content as a nobody
I'm a ghost with no body
I'm the phantom of WHATEVER YOU WANT
Whatever, indeed
I guess my soul is forever in need

Yo. I'm on my Maxwellhouse grind. So I really don't care about what happens outside. I'm my own man, so I know it's okay to say "I USED HCHO AND TOLD HIM GO HIS OWN WAY!" He pitched me the studio, I drove to home plate. On the way, scooped Show 'cause "his flow is so great." And Woody spend his time just ZONIN, so... hey. By the way? I been sober this whole day. So many of my foes that flow are so gay, they won't go away 'til I throw 'em some play. Which is far from acceptable. Hard to be professional when all your coworkers stare hard, undressing you. Ladies, I feel you. You gotta see the shit. To be The Man in this business, you gotta be A BITCH. And I don't see no reason to be lying for a buck, 'cause some "label nigga" wanna see the lining of my butt. What the FUCK, nigga?!

Hit up my assistant. "What's on today's agenda?" She said, "You're on vacation. Mind your business." Feeling like I got the mind of Clinton. Gettin' *mind* while I MIND MY BUSINESS. My girl goin' through my PokeDex like, "WHERE YOU FIND THESE BITCHES?! *I* be trippin'!" I used to collect hoes like Brock and Ash, till they eyes got Misty. Had to stop it. Fast. "She a slide?" Let my team rock it (Team Rocket). Bad enough my pockets had NOT A LOT OF CASH. Charm did it. My third leg the size of a barn did it, and I go SO FUCKING HARD WITH IT! (HU!) Y'all get it. Wish to be me. I'm the sickest GT. If it's a whip that you be, you a Mitsubishi. So ahead of my time, my clique is BC. Prehistoric. Pre-recorded. Need some more? Then run it back. I'm DONE with this shit. AND I'm runnin' rap
