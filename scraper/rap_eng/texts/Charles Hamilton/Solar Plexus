Let me see you bounce, before I bounce. Let me see what all the fandom's about. Y'all know when Hamilton shouts the rhythm's got to be just as ample to dose any chick. From her blouse, and her skirt. Damn, it works. Dammit, dirt. You had to be my last name. Stand in front of me with a skirt on. Let me work a song. Let me see you work it in a thong. Just for me, though. And my lovely, not-so-published ego. Ha ha ha to those that could say "we know." We can laugh along but I'm laughing in a song. And I'd rather get along. But I'm nasty in a song and you're bad in thong

Tell me how you want it, and believe I'm coming through
Tell me how you want it, and I'll do it all for you
Baby girl, get retarded. Let me see you get into it
Baby girl, get retarded. Let me see you get into it

I got a million dollar flow. I got million dollar beats. So I don't really care about the way you feel about me

I'm the Modest Mouse of rap, God of "Bounce to that!" A whole lot of people couldn't amount to the fact I put a lot of bands on. Everybody from Nine Inch to Cam'ron. And that's just the 'Land I stand on. Get down while I stand on my land. I can, feeling like Nas. But I can't because I'm feeling MYSELF
And I'm feeling the props that I ain't really get unless I was feeling that BELT. Rest in peace to my mama. But rest in peace to all drama

Tell me how you want it, and believe I'm coming through
Tell me how you want it, and I'll do it all for you
Baby girl, get retarded. Let me see you get into it
Baby girl, get retarded. Let me see you get into it

Niggas gotta see where I'm from. In the sixes I'm the hot one. In the business I am not one. To the bitches, yo, I got one. And I pop one inside of one, hot one. Now she got hot lungs every time she roll up. She act like she don't know what. But I slowed her slow butt down. Like come here girl, let you what you're about. Go and tick to this. Go and tick, tick, tick... So ridiculous. My flow so meticulous. A lyricist, not a clitoris.  I don't belong inside of that big pool. So come and see a nigga after school

Tell me how you want it, and believe I'm coming through
Tell me how you want it, and I'll do it all for you
Baby girl, get retarded. Let me see you get into it
Baby girl, get retarded. Let me see you get into it
