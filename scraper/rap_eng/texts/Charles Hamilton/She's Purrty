[Intro]
This song goes out
To all the beautiful women
That dated all the Urkels
All the Lauras that dated the Urkels
And all the Eddies that dated the Myrtle's

[Verse 1]
Low self esteem
With an arrogance to match with it
Talented I balance it match wits with it
Damn lady you find great dress
When was the last time you had an AIDs test
Am I playing? yes Romance
I got contagious love so when we hold hands
I can feel your illness through your glands
And I see your stillness in your glance
Am I too deep for this first conversation?
I'll shut up n just walk to the next train station
I'm just sayin I wanna make Frikky Love
No glove that raw real sticky love
But no love if you gimme that itchy love
Then she walks away I'm pretty fucked
No game not even a cheat
Either I fine me a reasonably freak
Or I beat my meat
[Chorus:]
She prettier than a motherfucker
Gotta get her name number social security digits
She badder than a motherfucker
Gotta get her home get her drunk
And as soon as I'm in it I'm

I'm

Baby ya

[Verse 2]
Yo I used to wild the fuck out at this ladies house
Till I met some other bitch that played me out
I swear I didn't get head she ate me out
Now I'm Franz Fernagen hopin the bitch will take me out
Not the dating route we went to church together
Slept on the couch felt like my back hurt the leather
I wanted to tell her I love her write the perfect letter
But in the end I guess it's worth it to sweat her
My other lady been buggin out lately
Mainly cause she knows I been seein this other lady
I mean I said I love you not that you own me

Fuck what my body said Ohh Dee
Okey dokey hate me in the morning but you got good pussy
Why didn't you warn me damn
Fuck am I supposed to do shit haha

[Chorus]
She prettier than a motherfucker
Gotta get her name number social security digits
She badder than a motherfucker
Gotta get her home get her drunk
And as soon as I'm in it I'm

I'm

Baby ya

[Verse 3]
Don Imus cause white chicks scare me
Rr maybe it's cause I like being
Compared to the last nigga that was trifling
Nah somebody deck me I never been with a Becky
WELL for longer than a summer Brake
I'm the color of ginger ale I don't want the hate
Had a few jungle fever affairs
But nothing too deep I'm leaving it there
I been fucking with Island girls n Brooklyn girls
Harlem girls are cool ok
Maybe I need to slow down with the race choice
Find a white chick that goes down n has a great voice
So I dream away ice grill n Tina fay
Meagan Fox Sherry oTerry yea I don't care
I mean the hood says I'm the black Limbaugh
Why would I ever feel pissed off nigga

[Chorus]
She prettier than a motherfucker
Gotta get her name number social security digits
She badder than a motherfucker
Gotta get her home get her drunk
And as soon as I'm in it I'm

Charles Hamilton
I'm

Charles Hamilton

Baby I'm

Charles Hamilton

Charles Hamilton

She prettier than a motherfucker
Gotta get her name number social security digits
She badder than a motherfucker
Gotta get her home get her drunk
And as soon as I'm in it I'm

I'm

Baby ya
