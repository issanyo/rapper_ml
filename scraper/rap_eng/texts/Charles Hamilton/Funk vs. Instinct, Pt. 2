If you can’t move. Then do a little dance move. Let me get up in your head like shampoo. Head lice, because I’m dead right when I say I’m dead nice. Not the dead type. But if I was dead I’d be in the top 5, dead of alive. You ready to write? WRITE DOWN WHAT I’M SAYING BECAUSE I’M NOT PLAYING!!! Not not seeing, just not playing. Not seeing what I’m saying? Not playing See N’ Say, either. I stopped playing. A lot of cats want to jock what I’m saying
Because what I’m saying is not playing. Hot when I’m saying it. Tyrese, where my kids at? Fuck the Rock, where my chips at?

Still with the grin, because I’m defeated by them n*ggas who’s physical, and I’m digital. But wait until a n*gga get a new crib, even though I’m in a new crib doing this shit. Just jamming, standing. Fuck fans if they saying my shit is not slamming

No money, just figures you’d bit my shit. Whole industry wishing to be in the booth with me. Because I do this music thing, truthfully. Like Hurts. Like speaking, like this verse. Like I’m not leaking out side of a purse.  So I’m seeing if your thighs want to work. My instinct is to say I’ve been a genius. But then it would lead to a different extinction. N*ggas dying at the thought of me replying. N*ggas crying at the thought of me denying
