[Verse 1]
Ain't nobody fucking with Hamilton damn it
I got more bitches than the animal planet
Y'all can be fly, I'm land, air, and sea
I don't care if she busy, she stand near for me
CH, the hot and cold knobs on your sink
Got your girl polishing me, hot as can be
I get brains like, whatever your brain likes
But most bitches is stupid, no brain types
Sounds like something that I ain't write
But everybody knows, that I ain't right
I'm so to the left, I'm irreplaceable
Y'all niggas ain't Ne-Yo, you're erasable
So man up, or bitch out, your decision
Either way its like ballet, the sports edition
November 10th 09, I'll be two two (22)
And you'll be at the goal line with a TuTu

[Hook]
Do it in a little bit
Do it in a little bit
Do it in a little bit
Do it in a little bit
Do it in a little bit
Do it in a little bit
Do it in a little bit
Do it in a little bit
WHOA nigga, WHOA nigga, WHOA nigga
Let's go!

[Verse 2]
I'm hotter than the letter G in Spanish
Or is it the letter J, still the illest in the planet
I'm eating, most cats need a samich
So when they call you fam, it's short for famine
Everybody I know has gotten sick of me
Call me a swine, fine, a pig I'll be
But when I'm on the mound, I'm pitching heat
Niggas still T-Ballin in the little league
You want love? I'll promise you nothin
Hit me, I'd rather catch a Briana, than a Budden
I don't even wanna see another interview
Show love, keep it moving, that's the END of you
Word, so I move to the next page
Sega Genesis, too cool to get played
I make all things possible the best way
Here's a predictable line, X-Ray

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
I get busy like a TEMP agency
From A to Z I'm in the game, don't play with me
Basically, doper than a E-Pod
Please God, make this geek stop
The veteran rebel, 23 pac
Upgrade you with a smile, Geek Squad
And I refuse to be C-Blocked
Ock, take a look like Mira
Biatch, I'm frustrated like a gated community
With Rick James in it, talking 'bout Unity
Recking your house, step on ya couch
Call me the rap prince, no dress and a blouse
I'm better at music than ALL my critics
Ask Wilson, I'm responsible for ALL his visits
And I could pipe ALL you bitches
I'm just too me, to call you bitches, sorry?

[Hook]
