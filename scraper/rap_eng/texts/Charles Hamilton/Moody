[Verse 1]
I'm not mad, I got glad and had a flashback
Mad gave top to sad and popped the wad in the glass
Tried to bag glad, and my past rocks to mosh back
Like any crack in the glass of what shatter will stop your life
Creatively a major league player on a beat
Repeated slayer of haters when laying disease on the base
Heated when paying homage to ignorant asses
But you see that I'm playing honest, grant and quit getting mad
Your bitch is asking for me to visit her in a hour
She sleeps with you, but gets in the bath with me for a meteor shower
Leave her deflowered
See with you, she grew her hymen back
While I get her hotter than a plot on the grass
Where you can find the diamond backs at
That's arizona
Smashed so bad, she woke up in half of a coma
Had a mona moment when she grabbed my diploma
Actually its was my nads, so I'm glad it wasn't over
She graduated to bat when I gave her a good review
Looking at the dude like ooh, woopty doo
So, I'm the shit like a whoopie cushion liquidized
Picture the thighs of a diabetic getting criticized
If you didn't try to vision it, then forget it
Like fixaden, I'm feeling better by the second
Shit doesn't affect me, well, not directly
Unless a becky or a lesley says I'm sexy

Take a look at the camera and say cheese (x4)
Only thing that hold me down is my leather (x2)
I'm the nerd that's cooler than fonzy (x2)
Eyyy

[Verse 2]
Look, now I got a call log of who are y'all?
May god applaud y'all, but all y'all that call Charles
With your off the wall thoughts, and repeated wishes for someones demise
Is only heating me getting pissed at the sunrise
Thunder times, and pummels the mind of the umbrella list
Hung fellas get unroped when I come celibate
Meaning niggas couldn't fuck with me if I let them hit
I mean the niggas I'm stuck with being a pleasant trip to stumble upon
I dress like a bum, cause on songs I talk with a hundred bunnies and thongs, longing for money
I keep strong, cause I'm hungry, and I only eat real bitches
The dormer evolver, the dream of a clitoris
Obscene, but who gives a shit? were all a-dults
Even thirteen year old freaks talking all retarded on maury
They wanna get pregnant? die from a bar of mine
Find your daughter crawling on the borderline
The line before I slaughtered your poor mind
For crossing the line between being fine, and eeesh!
Now I can finally speak
The lie detector test shows, that hoes get pet when I let go
Of respect and direct to x n o my testicles
So I never let them go, down, so loud there mouths go up so proud with them flow
Profound, so now with all morals a side, time to get oral
Recite the line that brought you to the morgue

[Hook]
