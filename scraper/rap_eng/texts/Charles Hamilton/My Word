[Hook]

If my world once should be tarnished
And all my words were garbage
Would you ever take a promise from me
If my world was just a fable
Our lives were on a table
Do you think that you'd be able to see, to see, to see

[1st Verse]

I live life to the fullest
My mind is a WMD fuck a knife or a bullet
My soul is a grenade pin I'm likely to pull it
Growin up they always told me play nicely I couldn't
Never good in groups I was born to be a leader
You hear me loud and clear like I was born to be a speaker
The industry's a slut get up on and you could see her
I walk through war zones I wore right through my sneakers
The demon seed from heaven I promised them hell
You don't want war with me I'm Donald Rumsfeld
Everybody's a race black and white
Well my race is pink so this track is right
And this beat here was made by Black aight
No race relations just rappin right
You ain't rappin right you just rappin right
Tryin to get your actin right just rap aight
See this world is mine I beat the devil in pinball
No bat mask and my message is get lost
Play it back and you get the same shit
But play it back and you won't get the same shit, nigga

[Hook]

[2nd Verse]

The greatest trick the devil ever pulled
Is the exact same trick that the treble ever pulled
Make niggas think that bass is cool
That's the best way you could ever face a fool
Give him a little bass the think it's dope
Next thing you know they gonna drink the potion
But this is Pink Magic no need to inject it
Just put it in your ears you need to respect it
See my my only fear is bein rejected
Only real fear is fear you know me bein reckless
Don't believe me you'll believe in a second
I speak through the wind so the breeze is my Lexus
So when I say that I fuckin breeze in a Lexus
It's more than just a lie believe and accept it
Ya'll niggas ain't sick you a measly infection
I'm a genetic curse perfectly and perfected
I fuck an angel that can turn into a beast when he's tested
Eat through the flesh and proceed to the next king
My kingdom has come your dynasty has to exit
Your just lookin bleak I ain't bein a pestis
The genius the best kid, Mr. Miyagi
My B-Day is everyday no gettin me bodied
Ring the alarm the color pink is a charm
And I'll be damned if I ain't got the world singing my song, come on

[Hook]

[3rd Verse]

I go in
Never stop flowin
So mind blowin
Like Chicago wind
Everybody actin like they know me and shit
I tell them cut it out like Uncle Joey and shit
Bitches plottin Charles you know you owe me for this
I don't owe you for shit
Ho blow on some dick
That's why I keep to myself
Because I'm Close to bein rich
And they know this shit so they lookin for a way
Lookin for a day that's why I disappear
Stay out in Brooklyn for a day, with a Brooklyn Girl
She keep it real with a nigga
But my Harlem girl know how to deal with a nigga
I'm God's soldier boy
God is a woman when she on her period
She wanna feel with a nigga
Somethin about that time of the month that get it sensitive
She get mad and take it out on my penmanship
But she late on my birthday, November 10th
She's pregnant immaculate conception dig this shit
If it is what it is then I live this shit
Dropped outta H.S. so the kid is it
Hcho is Morpheus you show me what the system is
I'm Charles Hamilton I'll show you what the business is, bitches
