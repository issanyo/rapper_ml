New friends, new allies, new rap lines, new bad bitches with panty lines. What am I looking at? Thighs. Or black guys putting their fist in the air saying "That's my guy!" I rap wise and I rap like a Wise Guy. A mobster, but I'm quite fly. I'm a monster. Once bitten, twice shy. But the right guy at the right time. I get bothered a lot. I used to get bullied when I was not poppin' and hot on the block. But the bullying shit is over, now I'm the bully of the block. Looking like a got a fucking fully in my socks. Fully automatic for your semi-ass niggas. Hit you with a Hemi mad quicker than that bad liquor I had to sip after I found out I am not Sonic and decided to start getting at Jigga

Love in your heart
(I don't see it there, you don't even care, there is no)
Love in your heart
(You don't even share, all I ever I share is)
All the love in your heart
My heart, it's my heart, it's my heart you guarding
I feel used up. But have you used up all the love in your heart?

I'm a code. Some thing I don't need to know, even though I already know. The "Bleeding Flow" is what I'm using right now for my freaking nose. Don't need to speak any more because people know. And if they don't, leave them leaking some more. If they don't want to leak, let 'em leak in the snow, let the cold heal them up. Cold lips, seal them shut. No code shit, I'm feeling well. But niggas want to make me at my lowest point again. So I ain't trying to make no happy joint again. I love making dark music but I'm feeling better. But then I'll be a poser, just like whoever. Whatever. I'm getting better by the second. And I'm better with my message. Forever I'll be reckless, stepping with a death wish. Never have you beckoned
Such a second-guessing-ass kid with the blessing

Now Pharrell is a friend. I don't feeling like telling them where you came from but I'll go to Hell again for you. A President to you before I was told you were irrelevant - It's not true, I got you - I hated on you, though, because you were on Pluto and you didn't know the whole industry was like Bruno. I hope you forgive me, I hope that you're listening. Nigga, I'm happy,I hope that you get me. Know this is history, my flow is so sickening. Boe in the crib and he knows that I get beats and I rip 'em. Make 'em, too. But this a beat that I made so, yo, safety for dude. And if there's no safety then who will I take him to? By the way, Jay: You can cruise. I refuse to lose just like you! You're kind of like my idol but if I die now you the guy I'm gonna fight, too
