She said she love me for my mind. I'll be damned, I love her for that behind. But behind closed doors I know more. She goes through a psycho's war. I met her at psycho ward. My life indoors was rewarded. My psychosis divided by the fact that I know shit. How can I try to provoke this chick? Silence and coping with trying to buy everything that a guy can provide the dopest chick. Riding by the sky is her smile, even though I'm the sun. She got me feeling like I'm the one. But so do so many others, I'm such a lover

I love it, I need it. But my mind be going through changes
I love you, I need you. But my mind be going through changes
Is it you that I've been going through?

I met another chick, I have to confess. I feel like I'm cheating and it's bad for my flesh. Becoming a beast, wondering if grief is what's going to lead to this beat - I'm thinking before I made it. Maybe I'm a genius, but the Whore of Greatness is what I must be. In love with She and too many other she's. What does she fuck with me? I love her, at least. That's the least of my love. The love that I dug from beneath ended up being love. So what must I become while I step on these drums? Something for her to love, is it in my mind? Can she read my mind? Are we intertwined?

I love it, I need it. But my mind be going through changes
I love you, I need you. But my mind be going through changes
Is it you that I've been going through? Let me know, girl

I feel fucked up because I have to sing about it
And all I know is my girl is about it
I'm still fucked up because I know I think about it, cheating
There is no reason to keep on keeping

I gave my life inside her. And now she has a little her walking around with my words. Quite superb, but all my nerves is my nervousness. So the words I give are kind of like the perfect kiss to the perfect lips. And she possesses both of them, both pairs. And I dare y'all niggas. I tell you niggas, don't stare!

I love it, I need it. But my mind be going through changes
I love you, I need you. But my mind be going through changes
Is it you that I've been going through? Let me know, girl
