[Verse 1]
Yo, welcome to Harlem where happiness is
Yes I'm the devil i'm back in this bitch
Grow out my fro, see what nappiness is?
Have you a sip, wrap up a gift
I fuckin' grew up like a sap as a kid
Palpitations from passionate kisses
Just cum on myself as an accident, Ms
Everyone watchin they laugh at this shit
I say I'm a virgin to shock the ladies
Soon as I fuck em' I'm not, it's crazy
Lately, though, I've gotten lazy
Throwin' a fit like a rotten baby
Love when the weather is hot and hazy
Cop some haze and drop to Hades
Doesn't this sound like pop in the 80's?
Bitches it does, you got to play me!

[Hook]
I'm an ugly supermodel, do you love me?
I hope so, yes. I hope so, let's go

Attack of the clones, I rap from the dome
But this is a written I chat with my phone
I lost all my bitches, I'm back to alone
Yes, I am single, a fact you know
I don't want nobody jacking my flow
I mastered it, yo. I'm nasty like hoes
Take off the condom and black with my pole
She has a baby, I'm back on the road
Blow me a kiss, I'm lonely as shit
Holding my dick, it's Pinocchio thick
I tell you a lie, it grows to a stick
You tell me the truth, it's more like a twig
Why resist the love of others?
I'm a sickening motherfucker
Time to get the covers, brother
I don't get enough of lovers

[Hook]
I'm an ugly supermodel, do you love me?
I hope so, yes. I hope so, let's go

Death can't keep me still
I will still be ill
I live on the runway
I'm living on the runway
Do you think I'm fine?
Living in my mind
I live on the runway
I'm living on the runway

Oh yeah, oh yeah

You know what my dude? I'm staying in bed
Me and my teddy bear, play with his head
Me waking up as a favor for Ned
"Color me bad!" I say to the dead
I swallow my pride and say to the rest
"Spit in the face of the haters who said
I'm done and completed" I want more and I need it
The front door is my zenith
I stunt more when I see it
Until the day the ill and paid are coming for my secrets

[Hook]
I'm an ugly supermodel, do you love me?
I hope so, yes. I hope so, let's go
