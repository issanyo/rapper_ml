[Intro]
Yeah
It's Charles Hamilton
Mr. Toomp
It's not DJ Toomp no more man
(laughs)
Yeah, going in
Ya dig?

[Verse 1]
The underground says Charles don't change
But how can I keep up with all those names?
Big someone, lil' uh hu, a last name that follows the letter J, man it's hard to separate
Fact is that my bars will never stray so Charles is forever the same regardless of the hate
Criticism from niggas stuck in a split decision, is this kid what's up? Does he suck? Or is this nigga spitting
Listen up, give a fuck as I whisper niggas
I'm not a jeeny, so you can not see me
If you could stop dreaming then would you sleep at peace?
Then why would, you sleep on me
Speak on beats
What the fuck kid, Charles is crack!
Opinionated, the Rush Limbaugh of rap
Hate it or love it I'm all over the airwaves
My statements are public, the blogs know what they dare say
I'm copying this one sounding like that one
But it's the Hamilton zone homie, act 1
You mad dumb I'm just trying to have fun, my cousin is the Lyte get a camera, action!

[Hook]
You can do what you want
Can say what you say
I'm just tryna take over the world
You can move if you want
Today is the day
That I'm takin' over the world
I've decided to take over the world
I'm Hot, ya dig

[Verse 2]
The label keeps saying Charles polish your sound up
You got it but we watching gotta plot from the ground up
So I'm in the booth busy broham
Your a star fucker taking pics with Lindsay Lohan (heh)
No man, nobody in particular but I'm tight what people do for the lime light
I been underground doing my thing for years
So it's not mere luck that brings me here
These new kids been watching me struggle, copy me
And now they tight watching me bubble uh oh
Denace the Menace is spitting the zenith again
The kid is ridiculous, vicious when spitting the flames
Who am I getting at? You wish I be mentioning names
I am that nigga, you'd be rich if I mention your name
I ain't your publicist (hu)
I just get to snuffing
But if I was do your home work Lizzie Grubman


[Hook]


[Verse 3]
Ay yo Harlem where the heart is, Cleveland where I started
Music is where I stay till I'm dearly departed
Everything that you been hearing is garbage
Either they think were dumb
Or they are really retarded
And I ain't saying that I'm nicer than most
But when it comes to gettin' on the mic, I don't choke, pause
Most likely to flow off the mind when I go to radio station
While cats spit rhymes that they wrote
Half the time niggas know, but half the time niggas smoke
Forget what they spit was on they albums
That's how come, raps outcome is in jeopardy
I just wanna make a change indefinitely
Thanks to Toomp I got a beat that sounds like a fucking heroin needle playing through speakers on a pike
That's why I got so many tracks
My flow isn't crack
Honestly I'm way doper than that
Go in the bathroom throw some cold water on your face
Deal with knowing that you ought to be replaced by someone who plays sonic and wore pink before a cam
At least I'm being honest
You bore me little rapper

[Hook]
