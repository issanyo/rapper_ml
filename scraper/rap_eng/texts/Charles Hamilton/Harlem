H-A-R-L-E-M
H-A-R-L-E-M (It's Charles Hamilton)
H-A-R-L-E-M
H-A-R-L-E-M (I ain't even in a good mood, man)

I done told you boy, I'm not Soulja Boy
I insist on lyrical fire
I don't know ya boy, but I'll roast ya boy
You think you me, you a liar
You can suck my dick, I run this shit
And I don't need all this bread
But because I spit, and my drum kit sick
I leave ya'll MC's dead

[Verse 1]
Niggas actin' like they know me, homie
You can't be me if I cloned me, blow me
You playin' with poison being blatantly annoying
I'll make it so that Satan sees your face this morning (Good Morning)
I won't shoot you, I'll sacrifice you
Trapped inside, wrapped in wires in a mic booth
Savage time, half the time you recycle
Throw away thoughts of mine, ask the Bible
I gotta raise my voice at these fragile ass pups
Faggot ass rappers wanna grapple, bad luck
After-rap satisfaction, Benny Benassi
Even 50 would ask me why I'm blackin, that's tough
I'm sick of these bastards wanna grab my nat suck
That was backwards for these rappers that suck
Pink is the color, red in my eyes
You dead when I'm high
I bled from the sky
Fell out of heaven, yeah bitch take that, hate that
You the reason why white people hate rap
Don't fuck with a minor
I shoulda made your aunt lick the semen out your mother's vagina
When I stuck it behind her, I'm cursed with you
Me and ugly had sex and gave birth to you
I'm taking a break to write, I got work to do
Yo HcHo what should I roll up, purp or blue?
My elders said I should respect 'em, I did that
I slid back, fucked around, and still left 'em
F 'em, this is what Charles is about
Niggas sounding all young with my balls in they mouth
Pause since you out the closet like Lance Bass
So stand back and make another whack dance track
You can't rap, plain and simple
Get your own swag, nigga change your issue
I'll beat your ass, call it a lame-strumental
You hard? haha, you can't aim a pencil
At a page to get through
Your name and pistol in the same sentence, is a shame to pistols
Came in the game with bite marks on my flow
"I bet I could sound like Charles", Nigga no
I think I should get more Vicodin
'Cuz these pussy ass niggas got me tight again
But if one of ya'll ever mention my wife again
Fuck the deal, your life will end, again
I told you I was Mr. Apolcalypse
Game over
Where the hook at?
