[Intro]
I don't know if I'm on my paranoid shit or what..
Fuck it, though..

[Verse one]
It ain't a race thing, it's an I wish I could be in the same place thing
Should be a great thing but this race thing may seem bigger
When you're racing a crazy nigga
The black kids said I act like my name is Connor
The white kids loved me cause they thought I was a Connor
Black girls dated me not for the honor
But for what seemed like all of the drama.. Maybe some commas
White girls either ignored me or took off they pajamas
And inhaled what was left in the condom
Here I am thinking do both races of chicks know the way they present themselves?
Or must they tempt themselves?
Fucking with me is like suicide anyway but when I'm not around they attempt themselves
What's worse is that these grown ass type mean metaphorically act like them

[Hook]
Post-lynching ceremony, cuttin' niggas off
Cause I don't fuck with niggas at all, so don't call nigga
(The number you have reached is not in service..
The number you have reached is not in service..)
More than a word
It's like a mind-state so don't get irate because..
(The number you have reached is not in service..
This is a recording)

[Verse two]
Can't trust niggas nowadays
The sound of slave owner houses in the graze of all the house slaves
Outrageous before a pound of haze niggas will surround ya day
With a thousand ways to make ya go out ya way to suit them
I know there's some Afrocentric ass nigga out there thinkin' "I wanna shoot him!"
Listen nigga, niggas do nigga shit quick to get pissed when they do some ignorant shit
You tell 'em nigga means ignorant then they say some nigga shit
Then sit on innocence like they don't give a shit
Come to find out nobody was listenin'
Then they do some nigga ignorant shit again for attention
Just to be mentioned by niggas who really weren't listenin'
All from a word put in existence when you put it in a sentence?
You do the division..

[Verse three]
If Asher Roth said "whattup, my nigga"
I'd grill 'em.. Then give 'em a pound because I feel 'em
Unfortunately I know some niggas that hit the ceiling just now
Another nigga that will fill 'em with pistol pellets
Because of the feelin' that's built in
Now how does the English language expect niggas to be chillin'?
See a word means to kill it
Which is a verb that leads to fillin' cemeteries with innocent children
Racial equality may just be sodomy of the way that we've been placed in society
Maybe Geography.. All comes from a crazy theology
A statement created by other races to bother me..
Probably..
