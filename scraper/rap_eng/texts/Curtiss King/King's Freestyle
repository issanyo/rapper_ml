[Intro]
Alright alright alright
Hey RST
Yah

[Verse 1]
Alright alright I'm here
I don't even care pull me up a chair
All you motherfuckers pale it's like I'm looking in the mirror
All you blood leeches hit you with a stare
Let my homie Curtiss hit you with a snare
And all that come with it
Vibing real fucking mental so you know I must hit it
All I overcome with it so my rhyme custom fitted
Shit is fire must admit it
Make you break your fucking neck like Busta did it
Wiping all the mind cluster with it
Suck a dick have some mustard with it
Your old sound washed up it's the dust that killed it
It's the rust that did it
Your whole crew weak lost forbidden
Nothing you could muster with it
Alright alright I'm dope
You ain't even know hit you with the flow
Come and see the show meet you at the door
All the bitches that are with you love me more
Your crew pink selfie snapping hoes
Like hustler did it wow

[Chorus 1]
You got to know
You got to you got to know
Say wow
You got to know
You got to you got to know
Say wow wow
You got to know
You got to you got to know
Say wow
You got to know
Yeah

[Verse 2]
Alright alright you blind
I don't even mind take it as a sign
All your other senses stronger Imma hit you with divine
When i rhyme Imma hit you with the shine
Imma tighten all 4 in a line oh my
Meet you like a semi-automatic God damn it
Center of the planet wear it like a fucking pennant
From now on this my game you a tenant
From now on I take it as a plus if you offended
You consider this a test that you attended
You can live it with no limit if you feel it
Want a penny for your thought you can bid it
If you can't dribble don't be tripping even for a minute
I been doing this bid for a minute all up in it
Eating so much I ain't fit in a minute
Hit me up on social going tricoastal
Even if you're local don't stop getting vocal
Never keep it on the low boo that we're back
Let's see how much you can click in a minute

[Chorus 2]
You got to feel it
You got to you got to feel it
Say wow
You got to feel it
You got to you got to feel it
Say wow wow
You got to know
You got to you got to know
Say wow
You got to know
Yeah

[Outro]
Alright alright alright alright
That's that Andr√© 3000 alright right there
Alright alright alright alright alright
Yeah I don't... I don't know
Shout-out Curtiss King man
I don't know how to finish this
It's a...
Yeah just... You can
You can just cut it right here
