[Verse 1: TreeOfLyfe]

No Vegas nights
Pair of dice
Groups of hoes
4 cups of ice
Floating on liquor
No appetite
We eating
No cellulite
Don't hit my phone with yo problems
Realest nigga in Sodom
Huh?
Head right above water
What you thought it wouldn't get darker?
Got the Spirit of an inventor
George Washington Carver
I breathe strong
Til I ain't breathing no longer
Im in LA
Land of the fakes
Live  wit Snakes
So I charm em yea
Man is real
Way too real
So when I move
I'm moving wit caution
Such monotony
Monotony
I Swear to God that I saw this
Na i'm feeling like fab in the 04
Said she can't breathe
Got deceived by her deep throat
Been strong
Man Caught up with some weak folks
My fault
Took a L
Nigga breathe slow
Like Martin got a dream
Nigga yeen know
Na yeen know
My nigga you just breathe

[Track Breathes]

[Verse 2: TreeOfLyfe]

Uh, yea

Another Israelite
Searching for da keys to life
Holy chariots
Judas Iscariot's
Haters try and kill you
They swing da hatchet
And bury it
Iz niggas in these streets

And marry it
And runnin' round ya block ain't
Travelin'

Ref to yo life
Penalize you for carryin'
Owe my common sense
To my papa
And good parenting
Even tho he failed at marriage
It's two sharing it
Uh, I see you mama
Praying away ya drama
I'm working for more den dollas
I'm learning collecting knowledge

Nothing's really a problem
If ya breathe
