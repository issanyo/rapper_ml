[Intro]
Drixx Madison

[Verse1]
My vernacular is spectacular
Fully liable to bite her neck, black Dracula
Now you live forever as my bride
As the mind’s eye, solar flare and Rapture coincide
I am hotter than the sun, kissing on another sun
Wrapped in flame thrower blankets, drinking molten lava son
So bear it all in mind, when it’s buy the album time
And anticipate my next line
And, and, and, there is not a solitary track I can’t devour
Making competition cower, faces sour and they scour
Every half an hour, as I blatantly hit you with power
That I shower, from my pen game dodging arrows from your tower
So when the beat drops I pick it up and proceed to slang grammar
With something you can feel
Man I live this thing for real
So anywhere in-between 50 hertz and 50 kilohertz I’m ill

[Hook]
It feels good? (YES)
Like it should? (YES)
On site? (YES)
It take flight?  (YES)
You with Drixx? (YES)
Up in this? (YES)
All night? (YES)
You're damn right!  (YES)
It feels good? (YES)
Like it should? (YES)
On site? (YES)
It take flight?  (YES)
You with Drixx? (YES)
Up in this? (YES)
All night? (YES)
You're damn right!  (YES)

[Verse2]
Why is NASA after me?
Because I broker deals on the moon slanging Helium 3
And that greed of money gets you missing real quick "G"
See it was never due to bullets you're riddled with envy
When I speak my truth I want to touch you
But all the idiots rap about is simply wanting to touch you
I’m quiet in the cut
I’ve never been the type to run around with-a-circle-of-male sluts
And, and, and, there is not a solitary track I can’t defeat
As I consume fire than expel heat up on the beats
That I eat, never sleep
And in hindsight see I’ll never peak or take a seat
In measures or the stanzas that I greet
You dinosaur, my approach carnivore the bar’s lower than before
So when you need me holler at Drixx I cure rap diseases
Need me in your life like Atheists need Jesus

[Hook]
It feels good? (YES)
Like it should? (YES)
On site? (YES)
It take flight?  (YES)
You with Drixx? (YES)
Up in this? (YES)
All night? (YES)
You're damn right!  (YES)
It feels good? (YES)
Like it should? (YES)
On site? (YES)
It take flight?  (YES)
You with Drixx? (YES)
Up in this? (YES)
All night? (YES)
You're damn right!  (YES)

[Verse3]
You are now listening to Drixx Madison’s clone
It’s been a hundred moons since I slayed the original
With spare parts in plastic, drastic, classic, bait-and-switch
So if you ever hear me talking about Bricks
I’m talking-about-building
Foundations and skyscrapers to feed children
What’s my attitude towards society?
I’m like a casserole full of rat poison, don't try me
There is not a solitary track I can’t smash
Reach into my verbal stash like cash on that a**
Shattering the glass, than digesting all the future’s past
So the future couldn’t last, narrowly escaping bomb blasts
Far from new to this
Homie I’ve been lyrical since Altered Beast dropped on Genesis
Floating in the stratus
Question anything in this world except my mother fk*n MC status
