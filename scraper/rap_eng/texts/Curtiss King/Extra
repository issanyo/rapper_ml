[Verse 1]
Yeah, wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up
Yeah, I've been going through a break-up
Yeah, me and fake shit are not together
And I told her it's forever, we gon' never make-up
Feel like I've been waitin', waitin', waitin', waitin'
Money wastin' all my time on suckers but it's time I faded
Sick of takin' that shit day-to-day-to-day-to-day
I got friends that still ain't pay to see me, used to have to pay to play
Pay my dues, came up with some dudes in this
Stayed up on my grind and now I look around like, "Who's in this?"
I don't see no one but us
Look at me I'm one-a-one
All my haters doubled up but I don't give two motherfucks
You just talk your stuff, I just think you do too much
You want attention, you won't get that shit from us
Stay out my mentions if you with that counterfeit
Y'all just play too much, I ain't with that drama shit
You be actin'

[Chorus]
Extra ever since I met ya
Always on your bullshit
You ain't nothin' special
I don't need no yes man
You got no investment
You just act so extra
You be actin' extra
Who ya foolin'?

[Verse 2]
Yeah, rollin', rollin', rollin', rollin'
Yeah, off the ground, don't I know it
Yeah, I can't deal with people sober
'Less you bring your girls, you cannot come over
I get sick of entertaining (yeah)
I just wanna make the music (yeah)
People tellin' me I need 'em (yeah)
They don't ever go and prove it (nah)
I be giving people opportunity, they don't ever go and use it (never)
I be setting people up, all I ever hear back is excuses
I ain't never need 'em anyway (nah)
Punchlines, I'm the heavyweight (yeah)
Nothing you say ever resonated
If you wanted hits then I'm designated
I could do this shit with my eyes closed like I'm meditating
Boy I'm detonating
Bout to blow up on ya
Put the bar way high but I'm steady doin' pull-ups on it (pull-up, pull-up)
Y'all got too many people in your sessions
If I ain't ever see you doin' nothing, I don't need the suggestions
I've been hella protecting
Laid low, learned lessons
I don't count on nothing but my blessings
Y'all just so

[Chorus]
Extra ever since I met ya
Always on your bullshit
You ain't nothin' special
I don't need no yes man
You got no investment
You just act so extra
You be actin' extra
Who ya, who ya?

[Chorus]
Extra ever since I met ya
Always on your bullshit
You ain't nothin' special
I don't need no yes man
You got no investment
You just act so extra
You be actin' extra
Who ya foolin'?

[Outro]
And we still drankin'
And we still vibin' out
And things get real when I start thinkin' out loud
It's gon' be a late night
Just another late night
But we be in the studio
With money on our mind
