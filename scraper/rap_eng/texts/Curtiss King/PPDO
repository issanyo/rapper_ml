Intro: Uniiqz Global!

[Verse 1]
Phone calls, pick ups, drop offs
Get the cash then I'm gone
Lay up in her criddy
Rollin' fifty's of that loud noise
Bitches smokin' like they Indians
And we fuck em like we cowboys
Passing you bitch like a cypher
Gassing her up where's the lighter
Roll another one up let's get higher
Bitch called me peter because I piped her
You's a handy man pansy man macgyver
Goons on deck gunman on call with the sniper
Red dot forehead then fire
Niggas shittin' bricks need a diaper
Tell em it's real life no survivors
Your bitch ain't safe so don't hide her
Fuckin' with niggas berzerk
Gettin' you murked in the dirt
Crackin' a smile with a smirk
Fuckin' ya bitch in her skirt
Back stage at my concert, Danny brown your ho!
She swallowed my kids for dessert
Then I kicked the bitch out your home
Stickin' to basics throw her a towel
Kickin' her out twist her head like a owl
Twistin' a joint smoking that foul
She lickin' my balls then cock in her mouth
Reggie Mills ya'll know the name
Smoking bin laden I'm bombin' your dame
Fuckin' her brains, i'm fuckin insane
I'm a God of the Gods bow down and praise
Kiss on my feet get down and embrace
Watch me go skeet and cum on your face
Wait , how does it taste , Go
Lemme switch up the pace
Chug a mind eraser and roll up that space
Shit I'm smokin' on will leave you defaced
Bring your bitch around me, I'mma put her in her place
Feeding her zanies coke and the bass
Actavis, purp, molly, and yurps
Got what you need if you needed that work
Three phones hit me up on a chirp
Sike nah, trap phones and a curve
Blackberries GPS out they ain't tracing my shit
Mobbin' and robbin' these hoes on my dick
Get the phattest bitch out have her boofin' a brick
DEA ain't got shit on my shit
Cuz i'm checkin' into tellys couple ounces and some bando
My set and DJ rep hard that's my band yo
Everywhere we show up you know we gotta po' up'
That H town & hennesy that Heineken that roll up
A couple bad bitches finna fuck in dakota
On tour now nationwide get inflicted
This shit is ridiculous , the goal is go global
Turnt up and stay with it from coastal to coastal
I'm soulful, souls full of dreams and ambitions
I'm living the shit that I'm spittin' I'm winning
The women and the whips are foreign
Fans worldwide nigga and I support em
Bands, cash money and the guap (make it)
Make It, all I know is stack dollas (its nothing)
Over me it's nothing , (nothing)
Over you is god (god) , Reggie
