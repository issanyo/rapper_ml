Girl this gone be your favorite song
And you gone sing it all night
And you gone sing it all night
All night long
(Give It To Me, Give It To Me)
Girl this gone be your favorite song
And you gone sing it all night, all night long

[Hook]
Ah baby you should give it to me
Give it to me, Give it to Me baby
Give it To Me, Give it to Me
Give it to me baby, Give it To Me
Give it to me, Give it to me baby
Give it to me (One More Time)
Ah baby you should give it to me
Give it to me, Give it to Me baby
Give it To Me, Give it to Me
Give it to me baby, Give it To Me
Give it to me, Give it to me baby
Give it to me (Give It Me)

[Verse 1]
It's been a minute since Curtiss gave me that raw shit
That's kind of funny, that's the same thing that she said
Tell me did you miss me? Did it make you nauseous
When I didn't return last fall as an artist?
Girl, I was producing and rearranging life
Redecorating scenery that wasn't looking right
Some people through the day didn't make it through the night
And I wasn't getting paid so you know I had to grind
Call it what you call it I wasn't making music
What's that in your wallet? A juicy ass booty?
Girl, you should've called me when I was feeling moody
Now I'm feeling groovy and looking like a new me
I used to make struggle raps, cuz I was struggling
Now I can't believe that that scratch keep coming in
The ratchets still holla where the "D" at
Holla back if you need that

[Hook]
Ah baby you should give it to me
Give it to me, Give it to Me baby
Give it To Me, Give it to Me
Give it to me baby, Give it To Me
Give it to me, Give it to me baby
Give it to me (One More Time)
Ah baby you should give it to me
Give it to me, Give it to Me baby
Give it To Me, Give it to Me
Give it to me baby, Give it To Me
Give it to me, Give it to me baby
Give it to me (Give It Me)

[Verse 2]
I've been living like everyday is my birthday
Don't you wish the Inland Empire had a Curt day?
Maybe that's just me
This ain't even my birthplace
But I call it home and the homies know my first name
Mr. Curtiss King, You spell it with two "s"
You spell it with one I'll give your number to collections
My nigga I'm straight, I don't need your blessing
Plus I don't like your rapper name
Hop up out the session
Rolling down the block like a running politician
Kids love the King and the King love the children
Only thing I probably love more is the MILFies
Don't ask me what that means kiddies cuz my mind is filthy
And your Mama sexy, go play by the swings
While me and tu madre discuss a few things
Donde esta tu novio
Girl are you a freak?
I really need to know cuz baby you are complete
And I was thinking you could....

[Hook]
Give it to me
Give it to me, Give it to Me baby
Give it To Me, Give it to Me
Give it to me baby, Give it To Me
Give it to me, Give it to me baby
Give it to me (One More Time)
Ah baby you should give it to me
Give it to me, Give it to Me baby
Give it To Me, Give it to Me
Give it to me baby, Give it To Me
Give it to me, Give it to me baby
Give it to me (Give It Me)

[Bridge]
Girl this gone be your favorite song, (Oh So You Think?)
And you gone sing it all night, (Is that right?)
And you gone sing it all night long, all night long
Girl this gone be your favorite song
And you gone sing it all night, all night long
