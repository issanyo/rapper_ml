[Hook]

Last night I had the whole club rocking, beat steady knocking
But today I felt bummy with no money in my pockets
My nigga you can laugh
But the ratchets still jockin'
Even though I'm feeling bummy
Man, the ratchets still jockin'


[Curtiss King]

How Ya feel
How you feel when you got insufficient income
You just payed the bills and now its lent inside your denim
And all you ate today was just a microwave dinner
Your friends say you thinner but you know you ain't been lifting
Cuz you didn't have enough to pay the month at LA Fitness
You ain't joggin' cuz you starving ain't no reason for no dishes
I remember bummy days at the park on the benches
With no funds in the pocket and no crumbs for the pigeons
And you wouldn't believe it
I bet you think its magic
Somehow I got attention from a sexy lil ratchet
Somehow I got the digits and my flat top getting patted
And to think I left my pad in some leisure wear fashion
So whats happenin', wassup, got that Axe fired up
Yes, I know its not cologne but the ratchets still on it
I said whats happenin', wassup, I'm a rapper on a budget
And guess I'm sort of dope cause the ratchets still love it bitch


[Bridge]
I ain't on I ain't on I ain't on but I'm on it trick
I ain't on I ain't on I ain't on but I'm on it trick
I ain't on I ain't on I ain't on but I'm on it trick
I ain't on I ain't on I ain't on but I'm on it trick
I'm on it trick


[Hook]
Last night I had the whole club rockin', beat steady knockin'
Today I felt bummy with no money in my pockets
My nigga you can laugh
But the ratchets still jockin'
Even though I'm feeling bummy
Man the ratchets still jockin'


[Verse 2]
How you feel how you feel in my dilemma
Sittin in the club sippin water with some lemon
And everybody know me cause I'm always on my grizzle
And my threads look official
Shout out LA Mental
If they didn't keep me fitted
Best believe I'm busy thrifting
For some shit that ain't expensive
From the 90s that was pimp shit
Bernie Mac would've paid attention
And smiled at my intentions
Till I asked him 'bout the cookies 'n shit in the kitchen
But who in hell in twenty twelve would dress like me
I don't really know bout fashion so excuse my apathy
If you catch me in the club with no Polo on my tee
And them niggas yelling YOLO you should know they not with me
There are days that I feel lower than the bottom of the sea
Till a ratchet came around and put her bottom on me
I said whats happenin', wassup, I'm a rapper on a budget
And guess I'm sort of dope cause the ratchets still love it bitch


[Bridge]
I ain't on I ain't on I ain't on but I'm on it trick
I ain't on I ain't on I ain't on but I'm on it trick
I ain't on I ain't on I ain't on but I'm on it trick
I ain't on I ain't on I ain't on but I'm on it trick
I'm on it trick


[Hook]
Last night I had the whole club rockin', beat steady knockin'
Today I felt bummy with no money in my pockets
My nigga you can laugh
But the ratchets still jockin'
Even though I'm feelin bummy
Man the ratchets still jockin'
