[Intro: C-Trox]
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 1: C-Trox]
Show up in an Uber like, whoa
Blacked out but my outfits straight gold
Bought a pump but I'm never gonna need that
Stevie got that tree, I know
Let me cop that leaf to roll though
That then roll a mo, I brought my click
We got real lit
Drank all that liquor, found some more
I don't ever really need to lie
I don't give a fuck, I don't wanna drop these girls
'Cause I just wanna dance, then go and get drunk
We don't even have a goddamn time for these girls
Pour another round of shots 'cause I'm 'bout that
I'll party in the frat, but I'm not that
I'ma let 'em talk shit, I don't worry about shit
'Cause man, it's real big, real me and lil' bitch, you don't want that
Recite to my friends
Please do not talk because I do not care to come listen
I'm done with y'all asking for favors at parties
It puts me in awkward positions
I do not miss this, y'all just don't get this, y'all so materialistic
I came to college to make a lil' money
But class? I don't give a fuck that I missed 'em

[Pre-Chorus: C-Trox]
Invites to every party 'cause everybody knows us
Show up to steal all the bitches and everybody noticed
Become the life of the party, what's that, I see a moose
But I've never felt so cool, tellin' 'bout, tellin' 'bout with my crew

[Chorus: C-Trox]
Yeah, baby, that's my crew
Yeah that's my crew, yeah that's my crew
Yeah that's my crew
Yeah that's my crew, yeah that's my crew
Yeah that's my crew
Yeah that's my crew, yeah that's my crew
Yeah that's my crew
That's my, that's my

[Verse 2: Arizona Zervas]
Yeah, uh
Pull up to the crib, I got that whole squad with me
Stevie got the VIP so you know we gettin' litty
Vinny poppin' bottles and he sippin' on the whiskey
Bro, that is not your girl, I swear that she just tried to kiss me
No joke, she a bad bitch
She don't know I'm a savage
She won't know 'til I smash it
Skeet up on her face 'cause I came with practice, yeah
She a slut so I passed it off
Might be throwing up in a bathroom stall
You be at the bar tryna flex on me
Bounce the checks like basketball
It's on, we get it poppin', see me dancin' with the flow
White boy kill it with the moves, watch out easy, hit the folks
Champagne bottle in my hand and got these bitches droppin' low
These girlies flockin' to the pockets of whoever got the dough, yeah
You could tell that I'm faded, yeah
Shit, I feel like I made it, yeah
Whole squad in that Uber Black
We just leave the club like we famous, yeah
Please don't make me go flex on you bitches and show you that this shit is real
My homie smokin' and passin' that blunt, you are just taking the L

[Pre-Chorus: C-Trox]
Invites to every party 'cause everybody knows us
Show up to steal all the bitches and everybody noticed
Become the life of the party, what's that, I see a moose
But I've never felt so cool, tellin' 'bout, tellin' 'bout with my crew

[Chorus: C-Trox]
Yeah, baby, that's my crew
