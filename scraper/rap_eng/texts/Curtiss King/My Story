Let me tell y'all, let me tell y'all
Let me tell y'all, let me tell y'all

V1
Let's take them back the year is 92 /
Ya boy is four years old, that's when they should've knew
Call into the radio requesting every tune
Then he'd grab his Xylophone to play along in the living room
Dancing with my mah then threw a fit when it was over
Beckoned them again that's a spoiled kid's closure
Diggin through my stepdads records when I'm older
He told me put that down while staring over shoulder
Had the thought I'll make my own cause that'll really show em
The product of a broken home // the beast demand control and
I ain't one to fall in line with other peopleâ€™s motives
So I listened to em all without him ever knowing

Hook
Let me tell ya, let me tell ya my story
I ain't in it for the glory son
Let me tell ya, let me tell ya my story
Ain't no one gon' do it for me so
Let me tell ya, let me tell ya my story
I ain't in it for the glory son
Let me tell ya, let me tell ya my story
I know that ain't really for me so

V2
Fast forward onto high school bumping do or die
Witness ye in the stu made me feel so alive
Watch him chop a beat and then he go and lay a rhyme
Made it look so yeezy // found an outlet for the poems inside
So a couple beats on limewire got him writing
Creative self expression what he found inviting
Something bout the car made the chase more enticing
Heard it all before //something told em keep on driving
I'm with BB in the Benz and we bumpin all that maybach
Chevys ridin high, oh man that take me way back
Just cruisin out for lunch // the fuzz stopped us on the way back
He told us turn it down we ain't listen when he say that so
That's another fucking ticket // sorry mister brown
A couple Devils with a cause // Hit their rhythm now
2Pac on a golf course // smash bucket then we go and lounge
Ain't no better feeling // blast the system with the windows down
// Hands high if you feel me //
College taught him drop out // 9th wonder made him busy
But the people under stairs made the atmosphere less shitty
Dilated on the goal time to bring the people with me

Hook
Let me tell ya, let me tell ya my story
I ain't in it for the glory son
Let me tell ya, let me tell ya my story
Ain't no one gon' do it for me so
Let me tell ya, let me tell ya my story
I ain't in it for the glory son
Let me tell ya, let me tell ya my story
I know that ain't really for me so

Bridge
Gotta keep on working and strive to make it
Cause this new found family his motivation
And these sold out shows signs of dedication
Proof that dreams pay off when you really chase them

When you really chase them
