[Chorus]
That's my city
I love rollin' around my city
It got me feelin like
La, la, la, la, la
Oh, it got me feeling like
La, la, la, la, la
Man you talkin' bout my city

[Verse 1]
It's true. All of the beautiful
People in my city, oh what a view
Ain't a place I love quite just like this
If I had a lil trouble, would you be there for me?
Man, it's been hot all summer
What a sight to see, I am you and you are me
It's ok to be happy, we got a right to be
This city really got a hold of me
I've had love, I've lost love
I feel strong, when I start looking round my city

[Chorus]
That's my city
I love rollin' around my city
It got me feelin like
La, la, la, la, la
Oh, it got me feeling like
La, la, la, la, la
Oh, man, you talkin' bout my city

[Verse 2]
From the hot to the cold, from the cops to control
Better stop, getting shot for the skin that is brought to the road
Better love your neighbors, least we talk bout justice
Families, sisters, and brothers, we will stand for each other
We are change that we need
Oooooh oooooh oooooh, I belong here, ya got that, bitch?
I've had love, I've lost love
I feel strong, when I start looking round my city


[Chorus]
That's my city (Minneapolis)
I love rollin' around my city (Minneapolis)
It got me feelin like (Minneapolis)
La, la, la, la, la
Oh, it got me feeling like (Minneapolis)
La, la, la, la, la
Oh, man, you talkin' bout my city

[Outro]
What do I love about my home?
It be living in a song
What do we love about it?
What do we love about it?
People, love for my people
People, power to people
