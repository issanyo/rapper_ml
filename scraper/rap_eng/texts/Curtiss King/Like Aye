[Intro]
I never banged but a couple cats call me O.G.,
Baby I can take the pressure put it all on me
Put it down for the culture we must
Put my vision out; watch that thang boomerang and come right back trust
Listen to your album? C'mon man stop
I'd rather find a roach in my cereal box
For the CA, LA, PA, GA

[Verse1]
Good morning, good evening, and for the days after
Here take these verses they’ll get you through the Rapture
A fan of offense, never victim
I’m like the eerie feeling of a neurotoxin coursing through system
Let the music get em, let the rhythm flourish on its mission
Let the steam from the beat rise cooking in the kitchen, Devil caught em slipping
Tryna hustle for tuition bragging big body whippin' now the same body’s in prison

[Hook]
This one’s for the C “A”, L “A”, G “A”, P “A”
So for my Day ones feeling this way
I want to hear the first letter of the alphabet, like “Aye”
This one’s for the C “A”, L “A”, G “A”, P “A”
If you born and raised in the city
I want to hear the first letter of the alphabet, like “Aye”

[Verse2]
Our IQ's took an "L" it's fact
So I have come to rescue millennials from Bull-sh** Mumble Rap
My past I unwind these
With no time for incidental, preferential, existential crises
Turn your nerve endings into nerve beginnings prior to the ninth inning
Never pitched, but no less still winning
Make the money, money never made me
Mellow kid from Baldwin, LACES, to Woodbury

[Hook]
This one’s for the C “A”, L “A”, G “A”, P “A”
So for my Day ones feeling this way
I want to hear the first letter of the alphabet, like “Aye”
This one’s for the C “A”, L “A”, G “A”, P “A”
If you born and raised in the city
I want to hear the first letter of the alphabet, like “Aye”

[Verse3]
Now it's time for the Sour Face, Sour Face, Sour Face
In their face, in their face, in their face, in their face
Got you like "Oh sh**, who is this, who is Drixx"?
Spittin' over Curtiss King beats; I am true-to-this
Was hanging on sets, but was far from an actor
Pitching pitches to myself my own benefactor
What I've learned in this life I'll give to you
Through a sound built for any land mass, crew, or individual
Foresight is my hindsight though it’s critical
Half wants to loads arms while the other’s spiritual
The world's on fire but I'm feeling sublime
As I convince America skin tone is not a crime
Let the music get em, let the rhythm flourish on its mission
Let the steam from the beat rise cooking in the kitchen, Devil caught em slipping
Tryna hustle for tuition bragging big body whippin' now the same body’s in prison
