{Intro }
It was 4:20 when I seen her
Had it Going on Like Gina
Had Her Smoking Strong in the Beamer
Now She Wanna Roll

{Verse 1: A.Green}
Smooth With the Words Baby You are Superb
Do You smoke Herb Serve Them By The Curb
Ride Or Die Be My Eve Never Leave
Said it's Wrong But We Need The Cheese
Never Had A Choice School Didn't Pan Out
Shout out To Shorty That help Their man out
In a Sticky situation You the queen B
She love I'm Notorious Like B.I.G
Can't Believe my E.Y.E
A Girl That match the style and steeze
Give you the Keys Let You Have It
Flow Above Average Hotel Suites that are Lavish
From D.C. to N.Y. We Smoke Colorado Kush
West Coast Connection Its a Marathon like Nip
Blue Not a Crip when we dip Ace we Sip
That Ass I Grip Told Her Don't Forget

{Hook: A.Green}
When I'm a Road I'm Gonna Think Of You
Gone Till November I'm gonna Keep true
All Love When she Thinks Of Me
Proud To Say She F**K AG
Tell Them That Your Baby
I"m Gonna tell Them you my Baby
Know I Drive You Crazy
But everything Gonna be Gravy

{Verse 2: A.Green}
Up and Downs Kinda Like A Roller coaster
Mr . Freeze Tell Me Who's F**King Colder
Give You Ice If you Act Nice
When I'm On The Road and You Keep it Tight
She Got Her Doubt S**t I got Mine Too
Know I'm In the Game It's All about Survival
Go To War Constructs And Some Goggles
Street Fighter Sonic Boom Like I'm Gyle
You Can Be G.I. Jane Before the Fame
Give Advice How to Kill My Lane
When It Rains It Pours Your Face I Adore
From The Big Apple Speaking to Core
Nope Never Bored When You In my Company
Forget the mask Not with the Fronting See
Love The Vibe Used to Hide
But When Im Wit You I Feel Alive

{Hook: A.Green}
When I'm a Road I'm Gonna Think Of You
Gone Till November I'm gonna Keep true
All Love When she Thinks Of Me
Proud To Say She F**K AG
Tell Them That Your Baby
I"m Gonna tell Them you my Baby
Know I Drive You Crazy
But everything Gonna be Gravy
