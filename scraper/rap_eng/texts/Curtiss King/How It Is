[Verse 1]
I got nothing but time to get this shit cracking
Making money off this rapping, they tell me my shit is active
Women think I’m attractive so I get it how I live nigga
Die before I work a 9 to 5 trying to live nigga
Uh, I’ll kill for a peso
Kill when I say so, ready to let this thing go
Survival of the fittest, go and get it
Break bread nigga
Run up in your shit if my family ain’t getting fed nigga
I behead niggas, fill you up with lead nigga
[?] all red nigga, ended up with dead niggas
That’s what I said nigga, do all that I can nigga
I’m the fucking man nigga, diehard fans nigga

[Hook][x3]
I get it how I live nigga
No matter where I live nigga
Check my shit on how I did niggas
Kill for them M’s nigga
This is how it is nigga

[Verse 2]
Get fucked, whatever to get a quick buck
Niggas slip up and I get em, even for ten bucks
Cause shit’s rough, it gets tough when you ain’t get enough
Niggas asking for free verses, I need my dick sucked
You want this, you want that, but can’t pay up
All they want to do is smoke weed, drink, and lay up
I work until the day up, and I ain’t never gave up
Grind or die trying, no kicking it with you lame fucks
You niggas think you spit cause you spit fast
Well really all that shit’s trash, I’m telling you your shit’s ass
You heard it from the protégé, brought to you by Brotha Lynch
Season of the fucking sick, better know who you fucking with

[Hook][x3]

[Outro]
Yeah

On the motherfucking boards and keyboards and shit
However you producers do that shit
Cause I can’t do it
But I can spit that shit over it
Shout out my nigga Curtiss King nigga
