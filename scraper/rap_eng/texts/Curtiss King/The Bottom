[Verse 1: Curtiss King]
Yesterday was all smiles
It was daps, it was pounds, it was carefree livin'
Then it all crashed down, my momma lost her job
They used to treat us so unfairly
But at least she got a check to take care of the necessary
Me and my sister had no money
And we knew the rent was comin', and we knew we couldn't function
So we kinda job huntin', I say kinda job huntin'
Cause I was stuck in between an obligation to my dreams
And my responsibilities as the man of the house
Every mornin' I felt ashamed
Give my mom a new excuse why I ain't out here gettin' paid
Even though I've been producin' and promotin' all day
That ain't the type of work that make the bills go away
And those the type of words that made me feel a certain way
Like I'm worser than a coward without a fuckin' vertebrae
Fridge empty and I'm thinkin, "Man, how much more can I take?"
'Till the sheriff's at the door with the new eviction

[Hook: Brooke Taylor]
Even though I've been strugglin', I know I'll make it
Put my faith and my energy into my music
I will rise, I will rise
From the bottom, the bottom, the bottom
All my dreams are reality, and I can see it
Keep on pushin' cause one day I will achieve it
I will rise, I will rise
From the bottom, the bottom, the bottom

[Verse 2: Curtiss King]
Yesterday was all smiles
And I just moved in with Jenks
In a one-bedroom apartment that was shared by three
My family moved to Compton by the Tims by Alondra
Even Kendrick'll tell yah, the wrong fein'll shoot your momma
How can I feel like a king? I feel like I was part of the problem
How could I blame Obama? That ain't the reason I was jobless
I was actin' like a child, stuck inside a man
Homie that broke me down and made me so fuckin' depressed
And I took it out on my roommates but they put that shit on hold quick
Like it's time to man up cause we all goin' through our own shit
Plus you 26, stop actin' like a bitch
And I didn't want to be homeless so of course I grew up quick
Me and my boys ain't have a lot except the things we could afford
And a couple of war stories we would share when we record
'Till it was knocks at the door, by the nosy landlord
She said "You need to keep it down, the neighbors hear you through the floor"

[Hook: Brooke Taylor]

[Outro]
The Bible, Proverbs 18:14 says "The spirit of a man will sustain him in sickness, but who can bear a broken spirit? The spirit of a man will sustain him in sickness. You gotta keep yourself strong."
