[Intro:]
Play this every morning when you wake
Oh Gosh told me not to sing on this
But I promise you
I feel like Mystical
Aye let me get this

[Chorus 2x]
I don't really got too much to say but glory
I'm just trying to live my day to day no worry

[Verse 1]
See this what I dreamed of
Would you believe it?
That lil Butthead turned into a Genius
Ok, a Beavis if you want to let my sister tell it
She still my biggest critic even when it feel compelling
But I'm hot now, and ain't no need to back track
Keep on if you cat nap or keep up with the snap chat
I be up at the ass crack of dawn trying to find stacks
Plus I tell my wife you know bomb with yo fine ass
Homey why you lying with yo lying ass
Please tell the truth man I promise I admire that
All I'm trying to do is kick game like an almanac
If Mya movin on, well please tell me where Mya at
Daaaaamn Daniel
Back at it again with them crazy ass verses
Man it's crazy ass Curtiss
Bouncing Like a Kirby through the mountains in a hurry
I was buried in these books and then I came up with a hook like

[Chorus 2x]
I don't really got too much to say but glory
I'm just trying to live my day to day no worries

[Verse 2]
I used to wish I was a little bit taller
So I could be a baller
But now I'm living good even though I ain't balling
They love me in the hood because I keep it kind of honest
But lately I been acting super fake like a Tonka
Fake it till you make it man you faking with your pockets
Fake it till you, man that's the motha******* problem
I Paid for some YouTube views but never comments
These blogs don't love me my dude, I'm an imposter
Just so I can hear from my peers  I got it popping
Just so I compete with my peers, it's kinda complex
Now I run around with no fear call me Colossus
Man you been around for some years at every concert
I remember I was angry with you
You stop coming to shows stupid blamed it on you
But guess who's home like the Prodigal Son
Feeling just like Mystikal with bottles of rum?

[Chorus]
I don't really got too much to say but glory
I'm just trying to live my day to day no worries

[Outro]
Oooooooo (8x)
Glory, Glory, Glory
It's like the last sip of Kool-Aid on a sunny day
It's like the last scoop of Ice Cream when you're feeling down
Glory!
Don't it feel so sweet?
Save the children
Save the babies
Curtiss King for president
Oh Gosh Leotus for president
2 presidents 1 term
The Chill Palace now and forever
Glory
