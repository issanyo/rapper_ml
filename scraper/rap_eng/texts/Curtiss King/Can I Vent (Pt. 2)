This life can take the soul out a nigga
Way before the Lord take the soul out your figure
I ain’t even talking about a Saint turned sinner
But lately all these loses I been coppin got me bitter
I Lost my grandpapa last year and I miss him
He never got to see the job that limited my visits, I should’ve called
Damnit I should’ve called
For all that he knows I was struggling musician
I don’t believe in superstitions or the tricks of a magician
But when Im making beats in solitude I hear a whisper

Dwan, please don’t take yo time for granted
Stop sweating the small things
And make them easy to manage
But see sometimes I get panic attacks
And I hyper ventilate till I almost collapse
I try to take a walk but then my thoughts go manic
And don’t tell me to smoke weed cuz that’s increases the panic

After his funeral I listened to Curren$y, Sade
Jill Scott and Kendrick Lamar
I even sent a text to Mr. Kendrick Lamar and
I thanked him for the music that he pen’d from his heart
He said 'sorry for your loss, but bro keep strong, you got a heavenly advantage with your papa in the stars……'
I was a zombie for the following the weeks
A workaholic roaming in a hallway of beats
Looking for love on a one way street
I thank God for anybody that gave me something to eat
If it wasn’t for my girlfriend, friends, or my mama
I’d be lost up in this whirlwind of drama

And I see ya’ll on my timeline talking about Obama
Like if you was in the office you could solve every problem
Occupying shit, ya’ll occupying nada but them damn Concords
For your Facebook albums

When I wrote Sinbad I was broke as Noa’s Jason mask
Turned my insecurities to everybody’s favorite laugh
Ha, but that laughing stop when video drop and I took cheez-it bath

Naw nigga, don’t ask me shit
Don’t ask me to explain you just see it Black and White
They said my video look like 'Yonkers'
Man yall niggas bonkers……or maybe you dont see the sacrifice

My vision goes blurry at the computer at night
But I type & I type till that shit looks right
You think my campaign a scream for attention?
I dream to rock a stage where Hip Hop is 1 religion
A ploy just to annoy Murs twitter for a mention?
You niggas trippin
This is my callin, this my destiny
This my therapy like Grandpop here with me
I hope he seeing me and smiling proudly
And playing Dominoes with Brezell Allen…
