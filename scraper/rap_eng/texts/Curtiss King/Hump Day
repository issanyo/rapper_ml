[Bee Honey Intro]
Oh, oh, hmmmm

[Bridge]
Aye baby I ain't seen you in a minute
I wrote this letter and I'm hoping that you get it
It seems you don't respond to my texting
But you come around for my sexing

[Verse 1]
Whoa now, Curtty hold that down
You know we be busy but when I be around
You know I want that
Baby Baby you know I want that (I want that)

I swear it's something in the air I can hear when you're close
I'm either hearing things or that's a knock at the door
You know I want that
Baby Baby you know I want that (I want that)

So I open up the door, guess who do I see?
A fine honey dip who barely fit in her jeans
You know I want that
Baby Baby you know I want that (So Come Back)

You know a funny little thing about the middle of the week
Straight to the room and we hardly get to speak
(Want That)
You know I want that
Baby Baby you know I want that (I want that)

[Hook]
And I give you all my, all my love baby
But you only want me on a hump day
You only want me on a hump day, a hump day
I give you all my, all my love baby
But you only want me on a hump day
See, you only want me on a hump day, a hump day

[Verse 2]
Whoa now, don't make no sound
Thursday morning she'll be leaving
But I need another round
Girl I want that
Baby Baby you know I want (So come back)

You smell the sex in the air
See the clothes on the floor
Had that ass in the chair like a 64'
Girl I want that
Baby Baby you know I want that (So come back)

It ain't fair to a player I been feigning for more
Got these thoughts in my head that won't leave me alone
You know I want that
Baby Baby you know I want that (So come back)

You see it's rare for a playa to be weak in the knees
But every time I get a dose in the middle of the week
I want that

[Hook]
And I give you all my, all my love baby
But you only want me on a hump day
You only want me on a hump day, a hump day
I give you all my, all my love baby
But you only want me on a hump day
See, you only want me on a hump day, a hump day
