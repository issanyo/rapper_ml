[Verse 1]

Walk up in this bitch like...
Bout to hit this lick like....
Cameras start to flashing I ain't giving no reactions cause it's common in the kid's life...
Niggas steady plottin tryina get my shit demolished but regardless it's a no-go
I should send their carcass up the top the nearest mountain while I'm playing this on slow-mo
And I'm that close
And I'm that solid
This what happens when your ends meet what you started
When you realize that a shoulda coulda's not an option
When your message is a bullet plus an antitoxin 
Tell my foes proceed with caution
This is light work coded in a vice jerk
Downplay it nigga but that ain't what I heard
Straight shots raise stocks in the kickstands
Neither trolls or the rats calculate the wingspan

[Hook]

Exactly
Doing it exactly
I don't know what Ima do exactly
Heath Ledger what I'm leaving on the ledges
Wonder how I do it, don't ask me
Where to be, where to go, never leave, never show
Block so hot yet I'm ice coooooooold
Trying to survive are my life goals

[Verse 2]

I'm where they don't care to stop
You got money then they care to watch 
They complain on it ain't gorgeous it's where DMX recorded part of Dark & Hell is Hot
Politicians under tables, hookers on the stables
Money guns drugs, niggas willing and they able
How can one raise a kid in this environment 
Living in retirement without some jewelry on your ankle
Somehow I did
Not a father tho I authored growth in all my folks 
Told them wisdom with no vision is a lot of smoke
Said perception is an only an invention, you gotta be within in the know
That's how I move, that's how I choose
Curiosity can kill but I just bruise
Know more about cocaine and heroin than comic books and anime but y'all ain't really hearing me

[Hook]

Exactly
Doing it exactly
I don't know what Ima do exactly
Stepping out on faith getting more gains
Wonder how I do it, don't ask me
Where to be, where to go, never leave, never show
Block so hot yet I'm ice coooooooold
Trying to survive are my life goals

[Verse 3]

My friends gone, I'm still here
Sometimes I wonder why I'm still here
Is this worth it, is it still clear?
If there was a wall, would they still cheer?
Should I take a turn, should I make a choice?
Is it my concern, Is it still my voice
Is whoever that I'm hearing making decent points
The playback's kinda different 
Magazines and covers while I'm posing with my brothers
Some of them were brothers now they hardly even cousins
Labels tried to stop me, music getting costly
Now I turn my shoulder every time a cop cross me
Maybe we don't have all the answers 
Maybe life just a series of our passions 
Folks play it safe, get a job get a family
I rather do it all plus some songs and a Grammy

[Hook]

Exactly
Doing it exactly
I don't know what Ima do exactly
Stepping out on faith getting more gains
Wonder how I do it, don't ask me
Where to be, where to go, never leave, never show
Block so hot yet I'm ice coooooooold
Trying to survive are my life goals
