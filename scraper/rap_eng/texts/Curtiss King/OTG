Grindin’
I’m on the grind, I’m on the grind
You might have been once but I’m on it all the time
I’m on the grind
You might have been once but I’m on it all the time
I’m on the grind
You might have been once but I’m on it all the time
I’m on the grind
You might have been once but I’m on it all the time

[Verse 1]
All them haters thought I’d drop, thought that I would flop
Said I’d only be a superstar on the block
Low key on the grind, yes sir on the clock
I told the folks “Wait, I’ll return with a plot”
The boy’s Phil Jack, the boy’s Byron Scott
I’m figurin’ a game plan to get me to the top
Big house for my mom, I think I gotta shot
Gotta get that money right, rather grind, not floss
They wondered if I slipped, prayed that I quit
And put the pen down, naw homey you was wrong
I been on the grind, slicin’ up my pie
Tryna share the shine, see homey you was wrong
I kept it low key, them other cats lied
I made dope beats, 6 to 7 every night
But keep it low key, they think you fell off
But I ain’t got the time, time, time
I’m on the grind

[Hook]
I’m on the grind
You might have been once but I’m on it all the time
I’m on the grind
You might have been once but I’m on it all the time
I can’t sleep at night, I’m on the grind
You might have been once but I’m on it all the time
I’m on the grind, I’m on the grind
You might have been once but I’m on it all the time

[Verse 2]
All you haters go to sleep, give me some peace
All I hear is moanin’ and cryin’, how I ain’t got that fire
But, excuse me, I think somebody laced yo weed
And you ain’t about that life, get the hell up out my sight boi
Eeny, Meeny, Miny, Moe
I got too many ways I can make this dough flow
Haters know that I’m gettin’ hella close
Been grindin’ for a minute, now a King about to blow
And I know that they wishin’ me harm
But the Lord got my arm so I can reach through the storm
I wasn’t born to be norm, my life I adore
So I need to get this poppin’ baby till I get some more
So

[Hook]
I’m on the grind
You might have been once but I’m on it all the time
I’m on the grind
You might have been once but I’m on it all the time
I can’t sleep at night I’m on the grind
You might have been once but I’m on it all the time
I’m on the grind I’m on the grind
You might have been once but I’m on it all the time

[Bridge]
I can’t sleep at night
I can’t sleep at night
I can’t sleep at night
I said, I can’t sleep at night

If you on the grind, baby you should smile one time
You should smile one time for me
If you on the grind, baby you should smile one time
You should smile one time for me
