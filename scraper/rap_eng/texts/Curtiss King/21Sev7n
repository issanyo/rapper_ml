The homey Soul said I might be one of hardest working niggas that he's seen
When the Scumbags video was cut/scene and complete
And I took the footage home, when I could've roamed the streets
Reminising with Top Notch and my peeps
But instead I set up shop 50 miles from where I shot
In a box called my room trying to chop up scenes
Rendering in Vegas Pro and the clock said 3
My mama say I'm crazy because I'm up like a feign
But all I really need is 3 hours of sleep....Loni, all I really need is 3 hours of sleep
I named myself King and I don't take that lightly
Martin had a dream and it looked just like me
How can I complain? I'm still below the Angels
Even though I'm slaving 10 toes on the pavement
Even tho these hoes want to do a nigga shady
I really want yo mama anyways, yo ass basic
And since I'm going in I must commend my haters
Salute to you fuck boys side commentating
Now I see the reason why Marvin went on hiatus
Now I see the reason Chappelle took a vacation
But I can't take a break
Because 24/7 is a really long blessing and I'm only using 21
21/7 till heaven tell me to wrap it up I'm acting up
Till my mama's mansion got an aqueduct
Black Cloud tatted up, Tell me why you mad at us
Is it cuz our catalogue keeps adding up and adding up
It's bad enough you don't think that our journey was a hard trip
You new booties think this is an 80 yard sprint
But where your cleats at nigga, you got the wrong kicks
Shit, and I ain't on but I'm on it trick
And this is a graveyard shift
Until I'm in the graveyard bitch
