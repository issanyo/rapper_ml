[Intro]
Pure rap shit
Let's do this
No dubs, one take
Let's go

[Verse 1]
To which I replied:
Ain't no way in hell that you can muscle me homie
Only if you will try to fuck with me now they mushing baloney
Ain't no ho can get between a horse and his dick
First second third fourth 'n the fifth
Of course I'm the shit
I've had so many women
I start to think I'm assisted living
I'm thought of Santa Clause for all the gifts my dick's been givin'
All them chicks been kickin' with 'em
All it is is pimpin-ism
Listen, women, Kaiser Von Powderhorn is up in your kitchen!
And these haters start to trippin'
I'm gettin' more money than a motherfuckin' Christian
True, young Prof is a baller
You can call the hater line I'll pick the first caller
Sunk so many rappers
I'm a sure father
Been with your baby mama motherfucker, cute daughter
Don't make me bring her toys out
Motherfuckers know I get intense like boy scouts

[Hook]
I'm the greatest
Don't front, I'm the greatest
Bitch please, I'm the greatest
Fuck you, I'm the greatest
Suck my dick, I'm the greatest
Bitch please, I'm the greatest
Fuck you, I'm the greatest
Don't front, I'm the greatest

[Verse 2]
I'm fuckin' Lyndsey Lohan, broham
A player got her open
A trip to Vegas,  for a little eloping
I'm Beyonce's fiance, I'm picante
You lookin' for a double date, Kanye?
Fuck it, there's a mermaid in my bathtub
The motherfucker's only there to give backrubs
How much an ostrich cost bitch?
Put it in a mosh pit
At my show and jump in like, "Watch this!"
Bitch please, got whiskey out the faucet
Little girls will hold my hair in case I get nauseous
Deal, motherfucker that's a bonus
Cut my girl's hair so I can think I'm fucking Jonas
Oh brother, I don't slow brother
Everybody knows I'm a cold mo-fucker
I'm thinkin' this is the end
Like OMG, I've outdone myself again

[Hook]
I'm the greatest
Don't front, I'm the greatest
Bitch please, I'm the greatest
Fuck you, I'm the greatest
Suck my dick, I'm the greatest
Bitch please, I'm the greatest
Fuck you I'm the greatest
Don't front I'm the greatest
