[Intro]
I'm prolly all alone on this one
I'm prolly all alone on this one
I'm prolly all alone on this one
I'm prolly all alone on this one
I'm prolly all alone on this one
I'm prolly all alone on this one
I'm prolly all alone on this one
I'm prolly all alone on this one

[Verse 1]
See, I just wanna take my chopper and aim it right at that copper
Who just locked up my partner, they can't stop us
I'm prolly all alone on this one, I'm prolly all alone on this one
I'm prolly all alone on this one, I'm prolly all alone on this one

[Bridge: Alori Joh & (Ab-Soul)]
Inhale, exhale, inhale, exhale
(I'm prolly all alone on this one)
(I'm prolly all alone on this one)
(I'm prolly all alone on this one)
(I'm prolly all alone on this one)

[Hook: Ab-Soul & (Alorih Joh)]
Who's bold enough to rebel? Rebel?
(That's the joint, that's the jam, turn it up, play it again)

[Interlude]
I'm prolly all alone on this one
I'm prolly all alone on this one
I'm prolly all alone on this one
I'm prolly all alone on this one
I'm prolly all alone on this one
I'm prolly all alone on this one
I'm prolly all alone on this one
I'm prolly all alone on this one

[Verse 2]
I just wanna grab that heater, run right in the cathedral
Aim it right at that preacher for miseducating the people
I might be all alone on this one, I might be all alone on this one
I might be all alone on this one, I might be all alone on this one

[Bridge: Alori Joh & Ab-Soul]
Inhale, exhale, inhale, exhale

[Verse 3: Ab-Soul (with Alorih Joh)]
I just wanna take that banger and aim it right at my Maker
For placing me 'round all this danger, I can't even trust my neighbor
(I know I'm all alone on this one, I know I'm all alone on this one
I know I'm all alone on this one, I know I'm all alone on this one)

[Bridge: Alori joh]
Inhale, exhale, inhale, exhale
(I know I'm all alone on this one)
