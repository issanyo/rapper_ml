[Hook: Curtiss King]
Hold up, hold up, hold up, hold up
Hold up, homie, why you gotta get in my way?
You see me tryna holla at this little dime piece
Why you gotta put your lemon juice in my game?
Why you gotta squeeze that lemon juice in my game?
Hold up, homie, why you gotta get in my way?
Interception, offsides, this is my play
Why you gotta put your lemon juice in my game?
Why you gotta squeeze that lemon juice in my game?

[Verse 1: Murs]
Now once upon a time when I was looking very fly
I saw a girl almost as dope as me, she caught my eye
But before I could walk over to this girl and say a thing
I was interrupted by this nerd Curtiss King

[Verse 2: Curtiss King]
Now excuse me pretty lady, don't want to come at you crazy
But if he gave you his number, I think you need to erase it
Oh no, I'm not a hater like that man is not a shaver
But look at his InstaGram, he wearing Adventure Time leggings

[Verse 3: Murs]
Now if Curtiss was a Jedi, his lightsaber would be clear
That means nonexistent like his fucking rap career
Look his breath got your face melted, please make your choice
Do you want a Blake Shelton or a reject from The Voice?

[Verse 4: Curtiss King]
Hold up, listen to his language, ain't he so damn offensive?
When I look inside your eyes, I see the loyalist missus
Do you really need a man to give you fourth and some inches?
Having your couch smelling like spoiled oil and incense

[Hook: Curtiss King]
Hold up, hold up, hold up, hold up
Hold up, homie, why you gotta get in my way?
You see me tryna holla at this little dime piece
Why you gotta put your lemon juice in my game?
Why you gotta squeeze that lemon juice in my game?
Hold up, homie, why you gotta get in my way?
Interception, offsides, this is my play
Why you gotta put your lemon juice in my game?
Why you gotta squeeze that lemon juice in my game?

[Verse 5: Curtiss King]
Girl, forget you ever met him but you don't forget my number
He be forgettin' to forget, that's a goddamn conundrum
This nigga got a Scion, but me, I got a Kia
How he gotta charge his car before he even come to see ya?

[Verse 6: Murs]
Why you yellin', high yellow ass nigga, baby, please
Ain't you tired of these flaky emo Drake wannabees?
You piss colored dish scrubber, still livin' with your mother
How you got the nerve to diss a real motherfucker?

[Verse 7: Curtiss King]
Hold up, girl, I'm so cold I freezer burn in a sauna
And Murs so old, he got a Walkman in his pocket
He probably even went to kindergarten with your mama
Sweet Lord, I mean for real, is he even worth the problem?

[Verse 8: Murs]
Cool story, bro, but let's state facts
Curtiss, you so light-skinned, you probably hate blacks
I'm getting sidetracked, baby, it's all about you
So is it him or it's me? Come on, what you wanna do?

[Hook: Curtiss King]
Hold up, hold up, hold up, hold up
Hold up, homie, why you gotta get in my way?
You see me tryna holla at this little dime piece
Why you gotta put your lemon juice in my game?
Why you gotta squeeze that lemon juice in my game?
Hold up, homie, why you gotta get in my way?
Interception, offsides, this is my play
Why you gotta put your lemon juice in my game?
Why you gotta squeeze that lemon juice in my game?
