[Chorus]
I broke the law, with the cops
Thought it'd put me on
Now I'm out running, running, running and I'm on my own
I hope they never catch me
I wish I would've known
I only did that shit cause Gucci's home

[Verse 1]
I feel like I just won the lotto, somehow I've been getting so lucky
I just got on top of the MGM grand took a selfie for snap said fuck it
I don't do this shit to be cool
But hardrock I snuck in that pool
Chilling rooftop and I'm topless with all of your bitches
You know what that means, I can see all their boobs
I just stole a bottle of vodka
Drinking this shit like some agua, its water
I don't even order, I started laughing
She call me daddy but that's not my daughter
She bent it over, that's just like I taught her
We got a room, I'm so glad that I brought her
Yeah, prolly running out of luck this year
It's been a while, I can't last much longer

[Chorus]
I broke the law, with the cops
Thought it'd put me on
Now I'm out running, running, running and I'm on my own
I hope they never catch me
I wish I would've known
I only did that shit cause Gucci's home

[Verse 2]
I'm driving this car down the road and you know my friends
Just bought some pack by the zip
I never wanna to hear "woop woop"
I said to stop smoking backwoods in the whip
Biting her lip
She looked at me hot
I only speak English but I got some thots
From Sweden to Germany I got a lot
All of them foreign, they all do their squats
In L.A I put myself on day to day
I want the attention like I'm on display
I don't drink when I drive but I'm swerving
Had a few bumps in the road I'm not perfect
Please do not talk bout your ex it's way damn too early
Forget that shit now cause I ain't the same person
I will let you know if I want to talk some shit on him
Right now I'm straight
So please hit the burden

[Chorus]
I broke the law, with the cops
Thought it'd put me on
Now I'm out running running running and I'm on my own
I hope they never catch me
I wish I would've known
I only did that shit cause Gucci's home
I broke the law, with the cops
Thought it'd put me on
Now I'm out running running running and I'm on my own
I hope they never catch me
I wish I would've known
I only did that shit cause Gucci's home
