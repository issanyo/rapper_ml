[Verse 1: Lewi]
I never really feel like I got recognition
I deserved
Now everybody want something
From me, look how tables turn
I became somebody they need
Didn't earn, But they gon' learn today
When I don't come back with a fat stack
To up hold they ass
Cause they asked for that
You can bask in that
Ima sit back and laugh at the fact
You don't even listen to my rapping ass
You into trap rap and that acid crap
All of that belong in the trash
If you sound like that how long to you think you'll actually last?
Against me an emcee
Who pokes and prods cause it's funny
Making jokes at you
Man with a hand in his ass
Made you out as dummy
Now some people they hate it
But fuck it others they love me
If you think I'm serious man
Then I do this for the money

[Chorus: Lewi]
Look at how these tables turn (2x)
Look at how these (2x)
Look at how these tables turn

[Verse 2: Lewi]
These things will come and go
But woah, Yeah So do people
That one homie that you got
Bet he drops, you cause he's evil
But don't you tell him stop
It is exactly what you need though
To find out what you can do
Or least for the people
I just perked up my ears and I listened
Didn't know I was so distant
From knowing all the positive & negative differences
So I wrote out some sentences
Self related discipline
From a heightened position
Just to find out who I was dissing
You fuckin kidding me dog
It sounds like you but it isn't
You hear me but I'm hearing you
Now it's time that you learned a lesson
Listen to this message I'm sending
Listen up to it please!
Cause if you don't got this
Then you don't get me, ughh

[Chorus: Lewi]
Look at how these tables turn (2x)
Look at how these (2x)
Look at how these tables turn
