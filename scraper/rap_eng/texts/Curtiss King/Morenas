[Hook]
You make me crazy when you pass by
You know that I'm your guy
You don’t gotta act shy
You know that I like
Morenas
Morenas
Morenas
Morenas

[Verse 1]
Coming from the zero vinte-um still living like a dreamer
Still trying to fuck the girl from Ipanema
Still swimming upstream and I’m picking speed up
But when I see you it’s like you turn the heat up
Linda, I ain’t lying about the truth
When I say I’ve never seen a girl like you
Rude girl laying nude with beautiful tattoos
And the way you move and groove and set the tune
The way you do the things you do it gets me loose
Make a sinner believe in jesus even he if a jew
Arriving like great news
The type of girl that makes me want to pay my dues

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Ey, I'm fascinated by your tan skin
And I see that you’re really good at dancing
Morena, let me start romancing your ass and kissing your neck
No need for questions
But she don’t think I got the best intentions
Cus' I'm being funny to get her attention
Acting like I’m flexing on the universe
But deep down girl I’m only trying to make it work
Like I'm Ferg, crashing in an Iceberg
Nervous and awkward - rap game Eisenberg
And even though I'd kill it in my social network
I s-s-still stutter when I try to get your number

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Aí Morena vem cá
Senta aqui do lado estende a canga
Mas ela nem quer papo ela quer beija
Vai e vem no coração foda-se pensar
Então vem pra cá chapa o coco ta no ponto
Deixa eles falar enquanto eu marco ponto
Posto cinco sabe que eu vou ta no ponto
Mas eu to na gringa agora igual ao bono
Foda é nao te ver no sol
Lambendo um picolé da Kibon
Xi Bom Bom Bom
Os de cima sobe e tu pega carona com
Né não?
Mas ta tranquilo gata fecha a porta e aumenta o som
