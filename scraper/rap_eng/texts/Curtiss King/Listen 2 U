Verse 1:
(oh Gosh)
(no no, no more, no more)
I Can't Listen To You!
When I listen to you it's a liability
Cause you be mentally killing my inner energy so I'm concealing my feelings before you injure me
I Can't Listen To You!
When I listen to you I feel like a Mini-Me
Cause when I kick you my dream you call them Little League
Why you be-little me? Why you gotta go in on me?
I Can't Listen To You!
When I listen, I be doubting my ability
But, you be trippin' you be flippin' like a trampoline
So I be dippin', I be out of your vicinity
I Can't Listen To You!
I had to look around the corner for some inner peace
But It's better to live and show then fool with enemies(?)
I need to carry this moment into my memories

Verse 2:
I Can't Listen To You
I took a step out the boat and walked on water
You said you wanna have a talk? Well, maybe tomorrow
I found gold when i left you at the Harbor
I Can't Listen To You
See, I can't afford to, walk in your shoes
You got me outta tune, so I ignore you
I need an auto-tune just to record you
I Can't Listen To You
I see the grass got greener on the other side
I see the snakes got meaner when the sun arrived
I made you hit the John Cena with your covered eyes
I Can't Listen To You
I'll admit it I'm my harshest critic
I get lost in my thoughts and get off my mentions
Who would've thought my biggest obstacle was my potential

It's the moment we get alive
It's the moment we get alive sometimes we wanna feel like this
The biggest hater's inside, Your biggest haters inside
This is what we get live, your biggest haters inside
This is what we get live
This is what we get live
This is what we get live
