[ Intro]

{Verse 1: Echo]

I be on some other shit
Like an indecisive fly, ya bisshh
Pardon my French
But Je suis un probleme, monkeywrench
In the works, I'm a jerk
I turn this up near a hospital, TWERK!
Hip-hop circus, too many clowns
I'm new school clothes, you hand me downs
And class is in session, fuck you professors
I don't want a Box Chevy, I don't need a new Lexus
I don't need a gold necklace, I just want to rap reckless
Body any rapper in the game, on my checklist
Here to break the rap records, I'm a sell the most
I represent the universe, I don't rep coasts
I don't mean to boast, but nigga I'm the best
Physicist-lyricist, put me to the test and

[Hook: Echo]

If you don't give a fuck
Like I don't give a fuck
Say, put ya hands up, hey!, put ya hands up (4x)

[Verse 2: Echo]

I'm a conspiracy, a theory
An anomaly, so fuck with me
I'm a human Rubik's cube
I can be intellectually, rude
I'm exponentially that dude
Top Chef, cooking that, soul food
Stay glued to the screens my niggas
While I scream I want free my niggas
I'm getting bigger, while the world is getting smaller
All these rappers rapping about how they money getting taller
The people getting smarter, they no longer want to bother
With that watered down crack juice, you want to make them swallow
No longer will they follow like the wind behind the arrow
Hawk up in the sky, coming down on all you sparrows
Bird-ass niggas, stop fucking with us pharaohs
You featherweight rappers are heavyweight assholes

[Hook: Echo]

If you don't give a fuck!
Like we don't give a fuck!
Say, put ya hands up, hey!, put ya hands up (4x)
