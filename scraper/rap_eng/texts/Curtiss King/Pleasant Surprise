Aye Woogie
Yea, we in this bitch
Throw something, smoke something, drink something
We gon talk some real shit right now
Niggas got it fucked up
Tony tryna tell me how ya thinkin'
It never rain out here
But Cali ain't always... we know...
Drought out to be
You can't just come out here and make it easy like that
It's struggle and strife everywhere

Bars was no lie
Each with no tie
Tom like had a fam
But you know there's more
Than that pleasant...
Pleasant surprise
But they still lie
But you can't be too sure

I'm catching the feeling, I'm feeling making the millions
I'm on my own vibe, with negative, I'm never gimmick
See I'm just chillin, so papa rudo, I smoke some you know...
Cause you know well I can take it
So count your blessing, thank your maker
And make some paper
I ready of all, I'm making these bars
I'm not gonna mall down like a motherfucking skyscraper
I'm try the livin where these women think they all stars
Don't talk if you ain't ballin
But they ain't got no cars

I ain't trippin mama, you learned that from your mama
She want the best for daughter
Avoid that ration that she had when having your father
But I ain't retching, I'm just observant
I speak to New Jersey to roll the curtains when is steps in person
I'm dressing smart, I Robot
I keep a eye out for them jelly stingers
And then the police be Rollie dippin through the intersection
We ain't bangin but my nigga keeps that way for wrestling

Bars was no lie
Each with no tie
Tom like had a fam
But you know there's more

You see I started off in Carsem
Tryna make my markings and not make a mockery of my craft in the process
The first thing that I craft it was pure narcist
And the feedback I was getting from my peers wasn't honest
I think they was afraid I couldn't handle their blunt lips
Now be discouraged if I get out of function
But fast forward to my crash course with the universe
Cracking up these comments like a comic now that you're alert
And now I'm getting comments on my music worth
Everything the people in pain, I made it when I was hurt
I never used a hateful mouth to make it out, just wait it out
Graded up and now I'm getting paper on this paper row
Is there a doubt that I would make it to my dreams
The debate was never if, but the hour we would meet
It's not what I see, that's a portion of the story
But what I choose to do in-between, only morely

Is you listenin?
That's that real shit
Real nigas talkin real talk
You can't just talk, you gotta walk that walk
Don't wait for something to happen
Make it happen

Bars was no lie
Each with no tie
Tom like had a fam
But you know there's more
Than that pleasant...
Pleasant surprise
But they still lie
But you can't be too sure

Life is on the rise from looking in on this far
They never see the grindin, all they see is the cars
They never see the rhyme at night and the early morns
Steady fightin with the motors and labels to put em on
All they see is the life, club nice â€“ VIP
Bottles after bottles, breaking bank like I'm being me
They never see us stressed out, gamming out cause the single that we dropped in
Pop like it was meant to be
And all the rate a star, OD no TMZ
Got caught blowin weed, gun charge, rollin deep
Judged by the media, hanged by society
My granny told me money and the fame will only lie to me so...
We see these stars giving their all 24/7 just to give us he greatest love of all
Let em know we still got em even though they got problems
His son he rock bottom cause we ain't breakin it down

Bars was no lie
Each with no tie
Tom like had a fam
But you know there's more
Than that pleasant...
Pleasant surprise
But they still lie
But you can't be too sure

Yea... so... there you have it
Bring gifts in perfectors and pimp action
Really doin this, really livin this
Don't be caught up in the media and these videos
And these lyin ass rappers and singers and shit
These ho ass producers
The last nigga
Anyway, shouts out to Carsem
Copton, Long Beach, watch, gardina, hall thorn
Shit, wherever you at
I'm all over you
Shit, wherever you at
Niggas say Arizona, right
Just ride to this shit
Live your life to he truest, my nigga
Remember, that's between you and God
Not nobody else what you do with this life
Huh, is you good?
I dig it
Cheers all my real niggas
And I'm out
