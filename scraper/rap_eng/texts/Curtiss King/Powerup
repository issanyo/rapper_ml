[Verse 1]
Woke up feelin' myself, they can't slow my tempo up
Knock-knockin' my doorstep, new t-shirts from Retro Duck
Q'ey rollin' that endo up, Joey sendin' me all the new shit
Cyrus in my headphones, man, I don't ever need other music
Ring-ring on my hotline like, "What's good? What's poppin'?"
It's Moe-T like, "Let's link, I'll pick you up at your apartment" (skrt)
Good vibes, got me feelin' like a kid again
Who changed?
Moe, School, me in the same thing we been whippin' in
Told y'all I would bring it back home, y'all prolly weren't listenin'
All the time I spent away, my heart never left Michigan
Put mitts up
Two mitts up

[Verse 2]
Ok, let's go
Ridin' 'round my city got me feelin' like a milli' though
Money isn't everything but we used to be really broke
(I don't know man, we're still pretty broke)
Ok, we're still pretty broke
Made a thousand dollars then I spend it on this video
On this video
(Made a thousand dollars then I spend it on this video)

[Chorus]
I been down, been underdog, man people said that I'd lose
I been behind, but then what the hell did I do?
I said I swerve, I hit that powerup
That powerup
I swerve, I hit that powerup
That powerup
Nothin' stoppin' you, nothin' stoppin' you
It can happen like this
Nothin' stoppin' you, nothin' stoppin' you
It can happen like this
Nothin' stoppin' you, nothin' stoppin' you
It can happen like this
Nothin' stoppin' you, nothin' stoppin' you
Look at what we did
That powerup
That powerup

[Verse 3]
Ok, let's go
Hit the shops to go get lined up, GRBC, they hold it down
Way they used to make house calls for them Speck boys when we came to town
That's a real one, no debate
I pull the strings, I orchestrate
I'm fresh as hell but I'm colorblind so my outfits never coordinate
Green to white, though, that's my jam
That's Packy, yo, that's my man
You Packy bro? Yes I am
That's my girlfriend, that's your bad
Call it luck, shit, call it fame
No expirations to quit the game
Turn my neighborhood to a label
Could y'all promoters please spell the name with a C-K
(Yeah, that's Specktators, S-P-E-C-K, then tators, no tots though)

[Chorus]
I been down, been underdog, man people said that I'd lose
I been behind, but then what the hell did I do?
I said I swerve, I hit that powerup
That powerup
I swerve, I hit that powerup
That powerup
Nothin' stoppin' you, nothin' stoppin' you
It can happen like this
Nothin' stoppin' you, nothin' stoppin' you
It can happen like this
Nothin' stoppin' you, nothin' stoppin' you
It can happen like this
Nothin' stoppin' you, nothin' stoppin' you
Look at what we did
That powerup
That powerup

[Outro]
Nothin' stoppin' you, nothin' stoppin' you
It can happen like this
Nothin' stoppin' you, nothin' stoppin' you
It can happen like this
Nothin' stoppin' you, nothin' stoppin' you
It can happen like this
Nothin' stoppin' you, nothin' stoppin' you
Nothin' stoppin' you, nothin' stoppin' you
That powerup
That powerup
That powerup
That powerup
