[Verse 1: LIL LONELY]
Ruby stay at home on a Friday night
Hoes blow up my phone, tell 'em that I'm quite alright
I might forget that my pimp game is weak sometimes
And if you slip you fall in loveâ€”now she's gone
Now I gotta ball, flex on Adderall
Sex on Tramadol, I guess I'll try 'em all
As I recollect, the records I collect
Most of the artists wished for an early death
I will give it my all, yes, I will give it my best
Anything to replace all the static in my chest
But I know she won't be home, I feel so fucking broke
I'm lethal, I bleed foam, and seep smoke

[Verse 2: ANTHONY MARS]
Tryna join the 27 Club
So many times tried to get off the subs
Yung Inebriated, Lil Half Cut
Both knees are shaking from the mass drugs
I put in my body every day, daily
Ex on my mind when I start masturbating
Somebody save me, 'cause I have no patience
When it comes to death, I'm not tryna be waiting
Not tryna be slaving for no vacation
Not tryna be you, or that bitch that you're datin', save all the faking
I'm just rollin', smokin' with my two cups, still losing
In between if I'ma fold or blow up, $uicide is what I'm choosing
