[Intro]
Uh huh

[Hook]
Now I don't got a million dollars in my pocket
And I don't got a million dollars in the bank
But if I was slinging bars for a dollar
A half a million fucking dollars in my brain
It's on it's way
Yeah dawg X3
It's on it's way
Yeah dawg X2
Yeaaaaah

[Verse 1]
Why hello there it's Curtiss
King bitch I been working
You seen me? What a rarity
Cause everyday been a circus
That's nothing but
Orangutans shaking butt and twerkin'
Nigga I ain't nuts
I'm bananas
Comin' downstairs in my new pajamas
I'm hella faded
Feelin' X-Rated
All fire ballin I'm celebrating
You questioning, my dedication?
I should question your medication
Gotta bill and a mill
See my dudes gotta pay it
When I came off road around 25 states
With a black cloud lit yeah we hit that shit
And now you hoes wanna jump on the dick
Don't stop, get it get it
This my type of party
Oh you popped a molly, you sweatin'?
Ugh
Get the fuck from round me
Keep stepping on my shoes around 10 more times
I'mma throw you off the roof round the end of the night
And you know now nigga (now nigga)
That represented like King
For the scholars, that ain't ballers
Salamate is not my queen
And you know now nigga (now nigga)
That represented like King
For the scholars, that ain't ballers
Here's your boost for self esteem

[Hook]
Now I don't got a million dollars in my pocket
And I don't got a million dollars in the bank
But if I was slinging bars for a dollar
A half a million fucking dollars in my brain
It's on it's way
Yeah dawg X3
It's on it's way
Yeah dawg X2
Yeaaaaah

[Verse 2]
Now I can't make it rain
But imagine if I brainstorm
I wouldn't pay a penny for your thoughts
And if I fell of your rot get rained on
Don't forget your umbrella
Ugh
Bitch get on my level
Step up your cerebellum
Don't fail 'em
Somebody tell 'em
I ain't no lightweight
Since Myspace had a Top Eight
And Usher sang that 'My Way'
I've been stuffing these bars off in my piggy bank
Bitch I think I'm Ricki Lake
Talking 'bout shit cause I lost some weight
I'm in the game
And ready to play
And now my team is gon' to celebrate
Don't stop, get it get it
Major labels have a helluva day
You wanna sign me?
You better find me
And that shit better be a helluva raise
I'm independent
Don't need a brand
Don't need your image
I'm a fucking man
Oh you got two cents?
Well my work worth 'bout a hundred grand
And you know now nigga (now nigga)
That rep that OTG
That's on the grind
All the time
But we don't do no shit for free
And you know now nigga (now nigga)
That represented like King
For the scholars, that ain't ballers
Here's your boost for self esteem

[Hook]
Now I don't got a million dollars in my pocket
And I don't got a million dollars in the bank
But if I was slinging bars for a dollar
A half a million fucking dollars in my brain
It's on it's way
Yeah dawg X3
It's on it's way
Yeah dawg X2
Yeaaaaah
