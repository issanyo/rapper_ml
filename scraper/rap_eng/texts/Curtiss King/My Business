[Chorus]
Why the fuck you always hopping in my business?
The way my name be out yo mouth I'm like yo dentist
You brought me gossip, cough and caught me a sickness
I had to block ya, stop ya make a decision

I don't know I just do me and get these digits
I watch my pennies turn to many I'm addicted
You say you don't like how I do it why you bitching?
Because if you did it like I did it you'd be glistening

[Bridge 2X]
Yeah you'd be glistening
You'd be glistening
Yeah you'd be glistening
Stay up out my business

[Verse 1]
Sometimes I wanna un-install my social networks
The times that I am not involved I do my best work
The gossip I don't miss at all
It makes my head hurt
All that talking don't it hurt ya jaws?
Just answer yessir
Life was better when we played Pogs on granny's dresser
Back when Expos was in Montreal
I'm just reflecting
I'm an expecting an important call so here's my exit
Gotta love me for my every flaw
My imperfections
Not to mention I expose it all
I don't be flexing
Put my feelings in a U-Haul
And change directions
Watch me put that hoe in neutral
And get the stepping
Watch me put that hoe in neutral
Just give me a second

[Chorus]
[Bridge 2X]

[Verse 2]
I seen a girl that look like Dominique Dawes
In a red skirt skirt
Mixed with Rosario Daws
When I met her told her
Soon as you gone and drop them draws
I'm going head first
See, that was a metaphor
Swish, for my networth
I did it for the nookie like I'm Fred Durst
See you did it all for the cookie like you Baby Dee
Like, don't be hooking me up with the little sister that's bigger than the big sister pretty please
You kidding me?
I meant to be

[Chorus]
[Bridge 2X]
[Outro]
(Scat)
Ever since a youngin' I was told
Any dog will bring a bone back
Any dog will bring a bone back
Any dog will bring a bone back

[Outro Talking]
See I was always told that
Anybody that brings you gossip
Anybody and any dog that brings you a bone
Will always take a bone away
And take it to somebody else
Be careful who you speak to
They're always listening
We always listening
Sit down
You Bish
Thank you, Thank you
