[Intro]

[Verse 1: Troi Breeze]
I'm that feeling you get when you light the blunt
None of you niggas fuckin' wit' me, I'm like a nun
I'm a blessing on the mic; I'm a reverend; I'm a Run
DMC, DDT'ing the beat when I'm writin' ugh
I'm the new dude, came up out the blue foo'
Get a blues clue, you a slight cold, I'm a full flu
Keep a gold chain hangin' like a loose noose
Salvin' over new shoes, blame it on my roots foo'
Willie Beamen, beam me up, I'm a problem wit' this
Swear to Heaven, the beat should've came wit' a coffin n' shit
Disinfect the microphone the way I be coughin' on shit
Mama shake it for me, sounding like an applause in this bitch
Peep my steelo through a peep hole
The whole IE know I'm Neo
The son of God in this matrix
Anybody debating that shit is probably an atheist
I'm hotter than satanists at the bottom of Hades bitch

[Hook]
Let a nigga breathe, let me vent right quick
Plottin' on a come up as I hit my spliff
Bitches wanna bounce like "this my shit!"
I know it's been a minute since you heard it like this
This is how we chill from 1990 'til (4X)

[Verse 2: Curtiss King]
I wasn't born in the 90's but I'm familiar wit' the timin'
Way before I started rhymin' and diggin' deep in vagina right
Watchin' "Living Single" in the dining room
Knowing I had to go to bed soon for school, I assume
I for one didn't see myself rhymin' for a livin'
Thought I'd be a right fielder on the diamond wit' Griffin, you know
Sportscenter highlights; Sportscenter Top 10 for stealing a home run from stealin' a home run from Frank Thomas again
See I'm a dreamer
But I never been a zombie I'm a talker
But I always been a walker
And that's how you succeed and you conquer
See, that's how I could be such a monster
Oh, you didn't believe now ya' time is up
I'm Robert Horry when recording bitch: I am clutch
I don't believe none of you lion fucks
Keep roarin' but, please don't lie to us

[Verse 3: Troi Breeze]
And that's the reason all the women want to lay wit' us
Cougar, cub or puma I be bending all they spinals up
Back when I was on the Playstation playin' "Spyro" tough
And Kobe had a fro, I knew they'd know me as a pro
My flow been this pivotal, since Nintendo sixty-fo'
You got that Nintendo Wii, I had that original
My homies whippin' sodium, while I'm watchin' Nickelodeon
I fell asleep and had a dream that I'd be on a different podium, huh
Wide awake and all my niggas eating now
All this loose leaf paper: you can't leaf a nigga out, ugh
Wavy 90's baby I'm the sequel to The Drought, yeah
From the era momma use to make us leave the house
Virgo 'til my pops told me what a Leo 'bout
I use to fantasize kissin' on Aaliyah's mouth
My self esteem high as fuck, I think I see her now
Shit I had the juice when Hov had a reasonable doubt, ahh

[Hook]
