[Pre-Hook]
This is for the days I wasn't strong
The days I was alone
And nobody answered the phone
And all you niggas stunted on me
On me on me on me on me
And all you niggas stunted on me
On me on me on me on me

[Hook]
I'mma show you how to bounce back because I can
All the days that I felt pain ho
Bet you never heard complaints though
Bet you never thought I prayed slow
I could took my shots, took my loss
Did my very best and I gave my all
Ain't nobody there when I made that fall
So ain't nobody here when it's time to ball

{Verse 1: Curtiss King]
Bang Bang, like the pull upon a trigger
I came up out the barrel
And now I feel incredi
Because we came from the bottom
And now we're doing better
No I still ain't got no car
But at least we on the road to cheddar
I say finally, cuz ironically
I seen niggas make all kind of cheese
And never give a slice when its time to eat
I broke bread with you but you played for keeps
You was thirsty for shiny pennies
But lucky for I, eyes on the prize
I was resilient in pivotal times
Where I ain't had shit but a dream in my mind

[Pre-Hook]
So hate me if you want
I don't got time to even bother
I say fuck that that nigga Cancer
Because he stole my grandfather
This is for the day I wasn't strong
The days I was alone
And Nobody answered the phone
And all you niggas stunted on me
On me on me on me on me
And all you niggas stunted on me
On me on me on me on me

[Hook]
I'mma show you how to bounce back because I can
All the days that I felt pain ho, bet you never heard complaints though
Bet you never thought I prayed slow
I could took my shots, took my loss
Did my very best and I gave my all
Ain't nobody there when I made that fall
So ain't nobody there when its time to ball

[Verse 2: Curtiss King]
Bang Bang, like a soldier lighting a cannon
From a distance It look like a flash, but I ain't a camera
And this ain't a fad
This for the nights I felt abandoned
Broke without an answer
Just Top Ramen and Fantas
Throw a couple Brew In, where's O'Bannon
I was so stressed I wanted a hammer
To end this shit but nigga I Manned UP
My skin gotta a little adamantium
And the wheels started rolling, where the hamster?
Where my Kings and Queens who got standards
My nigga we so outstanding
They say middle fingers up to haters
But I say fuck that nigga cancer

Chorus
So hate me if you want
I don't got time for all them feelings
You need to hate on that nigga Lupus
Cuz he took our nigga Dilla
This for the Days I wasn't strong
The days I was alone
Nobody answered the phone
And all you niggas stunted on me
On me on me on me on me
And all you niggas stunted on me
On me on me on me on me

[Hook]
I'mma show you how to bounce back because I can
All the days that I felt pain ho, bet you never heard complaints though
Bet you never thought I prayed slow
I could took my shots, took my loss
Did my very best and I gave my all
Ain't nobody there when I made that fall
So ain't nobody there when its time to ball
