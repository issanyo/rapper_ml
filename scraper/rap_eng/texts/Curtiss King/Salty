[Chorus]
(Yea) Salty and vindictive
I'm salty, I'm Sorry
I'm salty, I hold a grudge like no other

[Verse 1]
(Yea) I wish I could forgive and forget
He split my lip with a fist
She slit my wrist with a kiss
They gave me shit on a stick
I got revenge with success
I spent the rent on my fit
I got a bitch with some sense
I'm full of venom and piss
Sometimes I reminisce
About an ignorant bliss
And how the pendulum shifts
Look at the sins I commit
I got the cigarette lit
My nigga riddle me this
How could I live in that (?)
[Chorus]
I'm salty, and vindictive
I'm salty, I'm Sorry
I'm salty, I hold a grudge like no other
[Verse 2]
Fuck a rapper acting practice looking hard
Cherry picking false flagging with no regards
I'm pulling cards bruh
Throw shots, then return 'em to your sternum
I get my folks locked and we'll exterminate the vermin
Practice what you preach man, sermon after sermon
My chick want to cheat I'll beat her boyfriend up in person
Like I'm workin' on my person skills
Lets be for real
Politics will have you second guessing how you think and feel
You know why the Japanese are so polite, for like
400 years I heard all they did was fight
I'm like do unto others as you'd have 'em do unto you
And if you don't: do what though wilt
And please follow through

[Chorus]
(If you're) Salty and vindictive
I'm salty, man I'm Sorry
I'm salty, I hold a grudge like no other
I'm salty and spiteful
I'm salty, I'm sorry
Im salty, I hold a grudge like no other

[Verse 3]
(Ayy) I got high blood pressure, out on the road
May not find it funny, dude I think I lost control
The god of Hellfyre last son of Project Blow
Yea then fuck this industry in every single hole
Until she screams my name, and she curls her toes
Got so many different ways I could go
But they want me to battle still no, nigga, no
I done sold my soul for a pay day loan
And I hold a grudge like...
A nigga with a knife at a gun fight
But he didn't know it was a gun fight
Walk from a number 1 night
And the only thing he remembers is that he wasn't done right
Burn this bridge you better be Michael Phelps
From that point on you gone be eaten by your self
I'm (hella colored??) tears, my nigga we cried for help
My nigga don't call me
[Outro]
I'm so salty right now
Really salty right now
Like soy sauce salty
Like Mexican Chile pepper salty
Im salty like, like send this back
This shit can't be good
This why so many niggas die of heart disease
Number 1 killer of niggas is salt
Salt kills more niggas than aids, Ebola, racist police officers
