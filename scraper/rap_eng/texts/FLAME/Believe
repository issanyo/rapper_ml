[Chorus]
Yeah
I know you know the truth…
There is no time to lose…
So put on for what you believe (×3)
Put on (×3)
For what you believe

[Verse 1]
Put that red dot on me, drop me where I stand
Absent from the body, present with Him (Amen)
And while I’m in the body, baby, I’m putting on
The aroma of Christ, can you smell my cologne?
It’s a strong fragrance, can’t let it permeate
My life and my speech, just speak my statement of faith
Because what I believe is more than mental consent
But it’s the truth in it, that should lead me to repent (Amen)
And for these raw facts, We catch a lot of flack (we do)
And some have deviated, some come crawling back (Amen)
Cause there are consequences when you regard him as wack (it’s true)
But when you trust, it’s just like the garden is back

[Chorus]
I know you know the truth…
There is no time to lose…
So put on for what you believe (×3)
Put on (×3)
For what you believe

[Verse 2]
There’s an established order, That God has set in place
It’s for our benefit, and it should be embraced
I believe life life begins at conception
I believe Christ the only way to Heaven (Amen)
And I believe marriage is between man and a woman (It’s true)
And that Jesus is God, and in his second coming (Amen)
See what I know as true, we say by grace not works
We pray by faith he took our place and placed us in his Church
I know persecution comes from bearing the name
We may suffer now, but later we reign (it’s true)
When we submit to these biblical emphasis(eez)
God is pleased, that’s what I believe

[Chorus]
I know you know the truth…
There is no time to lose…
So put on for what you believe (×3)
Put on (×3)
For what you believe

[Verse 3]
The world is pressing harder, they’re losing their patience
They think it’s hatred when a Christian makes a simple statement
But this I offer David, we will not compromise
Just as sure as you look up and see the violet skies
It-it’s getting darker, hearts are getting harder
God is making His appeal through us, His sons and daughters
Be reconciled now, make up with your maker
That’s our message homie, don’t muzzle your face u-
See it’s love when we, tell ‘em before it’s too late!
See it’s love when we, when we tell 'em to reconciliate!
This can be done when we, when we keep depending on his grace!
Until he comes we must, keep contending on the faith!
Put on
