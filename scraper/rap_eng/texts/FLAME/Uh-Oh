[Chorus]
Uh-Oh the real truth is coming out
Uh-Oh the real truth is coming out
Uh-Oh the real truth is coming out
Uh-Oh the real truth is coming out

[Verse One]
I done traveled the globe, and friendly skies I done traveled the road
Done had family members die since October in '04
When my album dropped asked how many albums I sold
Cause honestly I really don't wanna know
See what I wanna know is, what I wrote is it grabbin' a soul
Into the truth of the fact that He rose
I met a lot of people, I been to some places I ain't been before
And my hunger only increases as I go
This is my true passion, as I'm passing through this life that is giving
Am I pleasin' to the Christ that was given, on behalf of sinners
Just to see a holy God exalted through life that has been fully exhausted
With His Father's business, my earthly visit before I lay in my coffin
Before you all I call God as my witness, this is truly His business
So on these tracks I will attack some new issues and old ones too
So for you welcome back and I missed you
Let's go

[Chorus]

[Verse Two]
I caught some slack from a couple of songs that I wrote
But my intention was to offer you some of my hope
See my intention was to offer you some of the freedom
That I experienced that came from studying Jesus
See I'm convinced of the following facts of "what you know affects how you live"
So knowing that is a proven fact, affects the kind of lyrics I give to my listener
The media's lying the T.V. is lying, and guarantee the streets ain't telling the truth
So what you want me to do?
But point to the Bible for more than survival
But God's word that be speakin' to you, they God breathe its true
To know that and hold back is blasphemy, so insult throw stones and laugh at me
But my agenda is to pray for your soul
And in love say the same things you should know
So on that note I say

[Chorus]

[Verse Three]
So in conclusion I offer this album to God
While at the same time I offer this album to y'all
And that may mean that I go out just like Peter and Paul
For preaching Jesus to the point where I'm socially martyred
But my rewards and my treasures will never be stowed
On this earth but in a place where they can never be stole
In Heaven where I know the saints most definitely go
Cause our inheritance is imperishable and incorruptible
And as I wait I pray with fervency
Cause the world and the church are in a human emergency
See it's a war and I done stepped into it
And I'm on the team of the rescue unit
For the following people..
1. Ones who caught up in false doctrine
2. Non-believers ignoring the sin problem
3. And new saints, so while my mic is on
All I've got is the truth and a warning
WARNING

[Chorus]
