[Chorus:]
Just like the rims still spin
Even after your car stops
Then where will you spend eternity
After your heart stops

God and man have broken up
My dirty just like Destiny's Child
We need a Nas and Jigga
We Christians called back to reconcile
Now what's beef worse than part uno dos tres
It's mankind steady dying walking apart from grace
The unseen is sin its circulating like cancer cells
You selling work Christ the Savior
Come through and cancel your sale
He's calling men to repent just dirty answer your cell
And He can cancel convicted felon from satan's jail
Since Adam sinned this fallen world
We've entered and fell
And broken God's laws now all sentenced to Hell
But you want them spinning rims
Spinning on them big wheels big thrills
Plus you want you five chicks like 5th wheel
I be on the Christian life
You be on that Kryptonite
Where you gonna be if you and your peeps happen to slip tonight
That's why you see Christians right
Gospel raps and Gospel hymns
You can learn a lesson paying attention to them revolving rims

Just like the rims still spin
Even after your car stops
Then where will you spend eternity
After your heart stops

Just like the rims still spin
Even after your car stops
Then where will you spend eternity
After your heart stops

Just like the rims still spin
Even after your car stops
Then where will you spend eternity
After your heart stops

Just like the rims still spin
Even after your car stops
Then where will you spend eternity
After your heart stops

Instead of rolling with the Holy Ghost
Cat's rather roll on 24s
Gripping grain switching lanes
Gain the world just to lose their soul
Man it's hard for me to see you parish
Just to cop something with 80 carats
Listen Christians will inherit
More than Nikki Hilton and Paris
Yea you riding old school
'64 Chevy Impala
Yea it's cool but what if you get to Heaven and can't call Him Father
Get to Heaven and gotta call Him judge
Cause you love blowing swisher sweets
Cause your love truly was more spreewells on your feet
So that means that you esteem
Material things over the King
Rolling Jeeps with plenty screens
Than have peace with G-O-D
Jesus said that He's the Christ
Shining bright like Neon lights
Jesus said that He's the Christ
Shining bright like Neon lights
But our hearts love the dark
Plus our deeds evil mane
Check the hood that's my thugs
Let them desert eagles bang
But life is spinning like them rims let us in man He can't
After we die if we deny Him just to ride on that candy paint

Just like the rims still spin
Even after your car stops
Then where will you spend eternity
After your heart stops

Just like the rims still spin
Even after your car stops
Then where will you spend eternity
After your heart stops

Just like the rims still spin
Even after your car stops
Then where will you spend eternity
After your heart stops

Just like the rims still spin
Even after your car stops
Then where will you spend eternity
After your heart stops

Yea, it's true Jesus does love the hood mane
Especially cats whose recipe is that wood grain
Mixed with that gloss on that Chevy off in that candy paint
Who's getting bent off in they sin from drinking that drink
But it's these same ones
He'll cut off and separate 'em
From His love and His grace
He's given us an ultimatum
On a scale from 1 to 10
Cause our sin zero we rate 'em
We were shaped in this sin now our nature makes us hate Him

Just like the rims still spin
Even after your car stops
Then where will you spend eternity
After your heart stops

Just like the rims still spin
Even after your car stops
Then where will you spend eternity
After your heart stops

Just like the rims still spin
Even after your car stops
Then where will you spend eternity
After your heart stops

Just like the rims still spin
Even after your car stops
Then where will you spend eternity
After your heart stops
