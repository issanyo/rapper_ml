[Intro: Flame]
God knows

[Verse 1: Flame]
Sometimes it comes out of the blue
Man you tryin' to get out of the rain
Feels like you out on the edge and you just tryna get out
Jesus said that this life has troubles
Yes he really meant that
Every time is like the first time when you get some bad news and bracin' for impact
Every time is like why? (why me?)
You lose another piece of your soul
Every night when you losing sleep
And tryna squeeze belief that he's in control
Feelin' like you at the end of your rope
Got you feelin' like this ain't even fair
Now you wondering is He even there?
Does He care?
But really you just scared
He knows

[Chorus: Jeremiah Carlson & Flame]
Our God is invincible
Within in the storm
The faithful one anchors us
He's invincible
Our God is invincible
Within the war the mighty one fights for us

[Verse 2: Flame]
He is our refuge
Just know that God is for you
He's not trying to ignore you
Matter of fact, He don't hide his face
But he provided grace
And already went before you
See, although you might walk through the fire
He will not let you burn
He the one that can speak to the winds and the waves
And then He obey, then we learn
That His grace is sufficent
Power's perfect in weakness
He increases our strength
We broken but limping to Jesus
Though my flesh, my heart may fail
He's my shelter, my helper
Because God is the strength of my heart
And my portion forever
Amen

[Chorus: Jeremiah Carlson & Flame]
Our God is invincible
Within in the storm
The faithful one anchors us
He's invincible
Our God is invincible
Within the war the mighty one fights for us

[Bridge: Jeremiah Carlson]
Come on to the cross
You will be set free
Through every trial, there is victory in Jesus
Come onto the cross you will be set free
Through every trial, there is victory in Jesus

[Chorus: Jeremiah Carlson & Flame]
Our God is invincible
Within in the storm
The faithful one anchors us
He's invincible
Our God is invincible
Within the war the mighty one fights for us

[Outro: Flame]
He's invincible yeah
He's invincible
He's invincible
He's invincible, yeah
He's invincible
