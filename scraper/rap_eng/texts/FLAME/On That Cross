When you were on that cross
I can't believe you died for me
Oh Lord you gave me eyes to see
When I was lost
You showed me which way to go
Oh Lord you even saved my soul
When you were on that cross
When you were on that cross
I can't believe you died for me
Oh Lord you gave me eyes to see
When I was lost
You showed me which way to go
Oh Lord you even saved my soul
When you were on that cross

Yes, the Lord reigns robed in majesty
The mountains melt like wax
Before the Lord cause He's Holy and it has to be
Nothing but pure reverence
By His wisdom and understanding He stretched out the heavens
Who can endure His presence?
Let us make a joyful noise to the rock of our salvation
We praise Him with all that we've got
Even the seas roar
Let the trees of the forest sing for joy as the rivers clap before the Lord
In case you've ever wondered
Why was it all done?
What is it for?
My Lord the stars moon and sun
Even the skies testify to your greatness
Revelation 4:11 praise for all your creation
It's all for your glory
Through your infinite power
Your intricate skill is seen through a blossoming flower
But yet Father you were pleased to bruise your own Son
So that sinners could come and be redeemed
Amen

When you were on that cross
I can't believe you died for me
Oh Lord you gave me eyes to see
When I was lost
You showed me which way to go
Oh Lord you even saved my soul
When you were on that cross
When you were on that cross
I can't believe you died for me
Oh Lord you gave me eyes to see
When I was lost
You showed me which way to go
Oh Lord you even saved my soul
When you were on that cross

We spend a lifetime looking for satisfaction in wrong places
But a blind man embraces whatever catch his fall
But if he's spiritually blind and can't see that he's falling
Then quite naturally this cat a keep bumping into walls
But if a man who was also God offered him sight
Said he could save him from his behavior and sorry plight
And give him eyes to see the beauty of God the creator
Would he take Him by faith and stop putting up a fight?
Would he fall to the ground with his face to the pavement?
Just to worship the man who was God making His payment
For the sin he was born in that made him blind
And the debt he accumulated for loving lying
And bringing peace between the one in which he has beef
And sins against every week when he's hugging the streets
And bring him close by the power of the Holy Ghost
The same God who crushed His son 2000 years ago

When you were on that cross
I can't believe you died for me
Oh Lord you gave me eyes to see
When I was lost
You showed me which way to go
Oh Lord you even saved my soul
When you were on that cross
When you were on that cross
I can't believe you died for me
Oh Lord you gave me eyes to see
When I was lost
You showed me which way to go
Oh Lord you even saved my soul
When you were on that cross

Listen...
Every step Jesus took on the way to Golgotha
Echoed throughout the universe - for you Father
For the glory of God is of infinite worth
And his death'll justify many and bring new birth
And every blow to His hands every thrust to his side
Every heave on the cross is for the glory of God
And now the murderer the prostitute and even the thug
And average person can now be cleansed by blood?

When you were on that cross
I can't believe you died for me
Oh Lord you gave me eyes to see
When I was lost
You showed me which way to go
Oh Lord you even saved my soul
When you were on that cross
When you were on that cross
I can't believe you died for me
Oh Lord you gave me eyes to see
When I was lost
You showed me which way to go
Oh Lord you even saved my soul
When you were on that cross
