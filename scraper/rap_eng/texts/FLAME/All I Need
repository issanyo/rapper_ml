[Chorus – Chris Lee]
You’re all that I need
The simple things you do for me you keep comin’ through
I must say that I’m impressed
I know you love the whole world, seems I’m the only one you know
‘Cause you’re so personal
You got me sayin’ like oooohh, because you’re fillin’ my cup
Oooohhh, I just can’t get enough
So let it be known, wouldn’t trade your love for nothin’
You see, you’re all that I need

[Verse 1 – Flame]
Lord you're so holy, in a league of your own
You didn’t owe me but remember you took Francis Jones
You gave me everything when my grandmother died
The greatest gift of all, you when you opened my eyes
Lord my heart was broke seein’ her in there dead
In the hospital doctor pronouncing her dead
You took my best friend, at the time I was blind
Hard to look ahead, hard to put the past behind
But like Isaiah 6 when King Uzziah died
I saw you Lord, seated on the throne lifted high
I saw you Lord, in a way I never seen before
I saw that you were love, yes and I wanted you more

[Chorus – Chris Lee]

[Verse 2 – Flame]
Lord you know its true, I love my momma and daddy
September 16th was the day they had me
And before I met you I gave them a hard time
Runnin’ away from home, comin’ to the crib high
But yet they kept lovin’ me, lovin’ me, now I see
That through my parents love you were pursuing me
Through all the drama and all the pain
They demonstrated grace until the ceiling caved
Then you saved me Lord, never forget the day
Thanks for carin’ for me through Caroline and Sammy Gray
Now I wanna honor him like Psalm 127
Can’t wait to worship with Him for eternity in heaven

[Chorus – Chris Lee]

[Verse 3 – Flame]
Praise God for April 5th, 2008
Married my best friend, Crystal Gray, that day was great
Used to be it was so afraid of gettin’ married
I can’t lie ya’ll, your boy was pretty scary
But God used my baby to come push out my fear
Thought I pushed her away, but she was still here
And then a real tear fell from my eyes
Because through Crystal’s love, I started to see my God
Because through Crystals love, I started to see His grace
I was overwhelmed, literally fell on my face
Now I would die for her, give her my everything
Not just the wedding ring, thank you Lord now let us sing

[Chorus – Chris Lee]
[Vamp – Chris Lee]
I don’t ever want to be without you again
Lover of my soul, King of the world but you call me friend
And all the people you put in my life
You used death to open up my eyes
Now I see the grace you show me through my wife
Paved the way for me to say …

[Chorus – Chris Lee]
