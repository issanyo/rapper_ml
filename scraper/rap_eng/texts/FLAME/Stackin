All that money in the world
All that money in the world
All that money in the world
But it can’t save your soul

All I want to do is stack It

[Verse 1:]
Can’t serve God and that money too
Can’t serve God and that money too
That Moolah got you tied in that noose
That Moolah got you tied in that noose
You fantasized about gettin' rich
You fantasized about gettin' rich
Blow a 100k on that foreign whip
Blow a 100k on that foreign whip

That big crib you want it
That Gucci Louie you want it
That roof gone on that drop top
That 'Lambo you want it

Heard him say he goin' all out
Heard him say that he never sleep
Heard him say that he out chill
Like a 9 to 5 to make ends meet
We out chill We hustle hustle (hustle hustle)
Money talks (she talkin' right)
She breakin' hearts
I see you homie it’s coming in
But all that money (mucho dinero)
Can’t pay for your sin

All that money in the world don’t change a thang
So you want the paper and the status and them chains
Try that green bitter collar on your brand

All I want to do is stack it, stack it
Tell I get that Porsche
Hustle all day marry when I rush
Living for the moment
Cause tomorrows never promised
Getting all this money
I ain’t gonna stop
[x2]

All that money in the world
I know you want it
All that money in the world
You wanna own it
All that money in the world
That’s your gold
All that money in the world
But it can’t save your soul

[Verse 2:]
You’ll commit a sin just to get it
You’ll commit a sin if you can’t
You just made money your idol god
And you idolizing that green
And you thinking God just blessed you
Have you ever thought it was the devil
Masquerading as an angel of light
Trying to pull you down to his level
See you and God are not cool cause you
Shout Him out a lil thanks thanks
But you more excited about a phantom
Or mansion or chain
He hates that way you love money
Then try to praise His name
And that’s so fake
And I can’t wait til you break
And feel His pain
See, what more does He have to do
Then He’s already done done
Then to send His son as a sacrifice
So people like us can come
See some of y’all got your own religion
Serve God and that money too
And you use words from the Christian Bible
And you think that you and the real God are cool
(Y’all ain’t cool man) But you really ain’t
(couldn’t be so wrong) Couldn’t be so wrong
If you really love Him
You’ll leave all them other loves alone
(that love of money)
But it ain’t to late
Just like that stack that
Follow you face and back down
And by faith act now
(I’m just 'trynna tell em)
