[Verse 1: Flame]
See, that's why we can't afford to just roam the Earth aimlessly, man
We can't afford to just go throughout life, creating our own rues
Consuming things that don't please God
Cuz we all a part of something that God established in eternity past
In other words, way before anything was created, He has a plan to create a world with people
And to save people from sin
So when He created Adam, He made an agreement to bless him with eternal life, but Adam disobeyed God
And the covenant or agreement was broken
Then God covered Adam and Eve with His grace
Then the Good News of Jesus Christ was proclaimed in Genesis chapter three
When God said that the serpent would bruise the heel
But the seed of Eve, talkin' about Jesus, but then Jesus would crush his head
So from that point, God made an agreement with Noah and spared his family from the judgement of the old world
Which was a picture of Jesus Christ saving us from sin
Then He made an agreement with Abraham, that his descendants would be as many as the grains of sand
And that not only Jews, but Gentiles, would be blessed to be a part of His covenant people
Then He made a covenant with Moses, and then with David, and through David's lineage would come Jesus Christ
Who was The Promise to David that he would always have someone to sit upon his throne
And then eventually, Jesus Christ came to Earth to establish the new covenant man
See, God is redeeming the people so that they may dwell with Him in a new Heaven, and a new Earth, and New Jerusalem
Look man, all I'm saying is stop, look in The Bible, and see what's really good
Cuz the world and all it's ways is passin' away, and Jesus Christ is coming back
