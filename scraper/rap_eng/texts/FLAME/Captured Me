Oh Lord Ive truly been captured, I can't believe that I ran away
Was that the end of my chapter and I almost gave up on my faith
But you didn't wait for that
I was on the run for so long
And you came for me
Though I told you leave me alone
You still stayed with me
You showed things to me
And now that im face to face with you, im so in love with you
I'm captivated with you
Now that im captured
Now that im captured
Now that im captured

Lord I was almost dead
Plus I felt trapped
Some nights I would ride, and just wanna snap
But I was chasing sin
Thought it would lift me up
Seemed like my only hope to get me out my rush
And part of me hated everything I was doing
See I was terrified thought my life would be ruined
But I was so addicted felt like I couldn't quit
Jesus come take me now cause I am sick of this
And yes he heard my prayer
And ran to my aid
Then the tears start to flow
Cause I was so afraid
To embrace change
Help my unbelief
And that's just what he did
And gave my soul peace

Oh Lord Ive truly been captured, I can't believe that I ran away
Was that the end of my chapter and I almost gave up on my faith
But you didn't wait for that
I was on the run for so long
And you came for me
Though I told you leave me alone
You still stayed with me
You showed things to me
And now that im face to face with you, im so in love with you
I'm captivated with you
Now that im captured
Now that im captured
Now that im captured

Father, for your own pleasure
You sent us your son
You gave us your spirit
