When I do it I over do it
Look at what you made me do (3)
When I do it I over do it
Look at what you made me do (3)
I don't wanna be that guy
I'm just trying to give the truth to you
I don't wanna be the bad guy
But I know what this life can do to you
Look at what you made me do (3)
And I hope you make the right move
Look at what you made me do

[Verse 1: Flame]
Bad guy, promise I don't wanna be that guy
But the fact I even mention I'm a Christian now they back off, thats why
So they figure they know me, know my position I'm holy
They throw me in their mind with fogies
I speak on this good news but they only know them as oldies, Shonobi
Don't want that title not you
It is not poppin' to say
That judgement is coming but if I believe it then wouldn't it be loving to say
I can prove that, gon ahead on pursue that
I know you say you gonna do you but do you wanna do that

I don't wanna be the bad guy
But I know what this life can do to you
Look at what you made me do (3)
And I hope you make the right move
Look at what you made me do

[Verse 2: Flame]
Look at what you made me do say to you
He created you but you cater to what enables you
When I look at our trajectory I expect to see
Any second new developments that will threaten me
Can't I talk about that if you don't accept same sex marriages
Then why you wanna threat They be hollerin' tolerance now they ain't about that
Same people are intolerant how they gon vouch that
Do that gon ahead homie do that do
They be talking bout love all the time we gon show them how to do that
This is to the new gen that we livin' in you don't gotta switch genders to live again
Cause the God of the Christian is full of love
That's why his son shed blood to forgive sin

[Verse 3: ?]
Look what you made me become for you
Brothered you I see His Son in you
I see the one who will comfort you sonnin' you
Look what he's done for you
I see him run for you but is he runnin' you
Bruh don't you want him aiding you not evading you [?] you and reshaping you
Making case for you recreating you saving you made I pray for you
Look at what you made me do
