A'ight! You know we got the royal flush
So basically that means lights out, game over
Lights out, game over
Lights out, game over
Lights out, game over

{Verse 1}
Through the work of the cross I'm justified
And made righteous inside a Holy God
But from a righteousness that is not our own
It's been imbued and included through Christ alone
In justification our works have no place at all
Just a ___? to the church to reverse the fall
Just an act of our God moment we believe
Christ as mediator perfectly meets the need
And now holy in heaven we're brought into Him
'cause the cross of Christ put an end to sin
And now the next work begins, our sanctification!
Sanctified! Thank the God who made us, the God who raised us
The God we praise is the God of nature!

Rah!
{Chorus}
Lights out, game over. We won, we won
Lights out, game over
Lights out, game over
Winning hand, that winning hand!
Winning hand, that winning hand!
Game over
Game over
It ain't cuz of what I did, I'm gonna tell you that
You need to get with the squad man
Get on that winning team

Alright, turn up

{Verse 2}
