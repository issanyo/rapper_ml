[Intro: Sauce Walka]
Oooh, Su Woooo
Sauce, sauce, sauce, sauce, sauce

[Pre Hook: Sauce Walka]
All of my bitches legit, all of my codeine legit
All of this designer legit, call up the plug it's legit
The rounds in that chopper's legit, all of my diamonds legit
All of my hustles legit, my bitch don't count it legit

[Hook: Sauce Walka]
I'm too legited to quited, I'm too legited to quited
I'm too legited to quited, I'm too legited to quited
I'm too legited to quited, I'm too legited to quited
All of my bitches legit, all of my codeine legit
All of this designer legit, call up the plug it's legit
I'm too legited to quited, I'm too legited to quited
I'm too legited to quited, I'm too legited to quited
I'm too legited to quited, I'm too legited to quited

[Verse 1: Sauce Walka]
I'm too legited to quited
Pimped on a bitch, yeah I did it
Sauce Walka blow off your fitted
Then tell your people I did it
I made a band like I'm Diddy
I'm made with cheese like a Philly
I made your bitch get naked on FaceTime
I seen more than her titties
I am Sauce Gotti
If the nigga ain't legit then he ain't around me
Legit in the county
I was whoopin' niggas for a piece of a brownie
These bitches had doubt me
Now I'm too legit since the radio found me
Now she's stuck without me
Call missed, can't touch this
Ferragamo wrist, Balenciaga kicks
Tokyo bitch, watch her drop kick, call it Chung Lee
Sauce on me, I'm HD, Sauce ray vision
Call me Scotty Drippin', 33 bitches, nigga really pimpin'

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Flame]
She say that the Sauce is the topic, well bitch I know that we is
My niggas got 30's and 40's
One shot to your dome cause my aim so legit
My bitch is legit, I pull up in Benz like bitch I'm the shit
Smokin' on pressure, the pack is legit
I'm hittin' em up for the bricks
Load up the blimp, I see it, I want it, I cop it, new money legit
No countin' a fifth, pull up on your bitch and I feel like a brick
I mack on your bitch, she fuck with a pimp, she say I'm the shit
I'm too legit to quit, my niggas too legit
Finesse the bitch for a couple bands, Lil Flame so legit
I really pimped a bitch, I was really lockin' big B's with my pits
Third Ward be the bricks
My niggas in trenches whippin' up fishes, all my niggas get it
