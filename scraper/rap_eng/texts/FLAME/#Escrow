[Hook]
Dude looking at me like I'm less
Drama came out of nowhere like presto
Now they tryin to gas me up like petrol
I say it's cool but imma put it on an escrow

I'mma put it on an escrow!
(What you gone do?)
I'mma put it on an escrow!
(Man you acting like you cool!)
I'mma put it on an escrow!
(This dude about to act a fool!)
I'mma put it on an escrow!
(Man I'm guessing that you do!)

[Verse 1: Flame]

Sun shining now its time to get my day going
And now this dude looking at me like say something
I'm like you better be glad that I got my safe on
Cause I  ain't tyring to go back to the place I'm saved from
I'mma take it all a chin!
I'm willing to take an L
Becasue vengence is his
And my obedience as well
Deposit I'm making untill later it'll pay off
Even if they count me out and say that I'm soft
(Heaven's rewards)
Got'em laid in my sights
Gotta think of them nights
You never mumbled a word
But they lied on you so they might
Murdered you then they spit on you slappin you in the face
Jesus you could've killed them but actually showed them grace!
Now that's Escrow! Cause he rollin the crown
It's funny cause now the tables have been turned around!
So every action I refuse to lash out!
Is me depositing now and then later I cash out!

[Verse 2: Mike REAL]

The world plan on burying the boy
Yeah they wanna throw dirt an hurry at the boy
They throwin jokes Bill Murry at the boy
Shots fired why they throwin Steph Curry at the boy
They say Christian rap wack you should switch it to doin regular
You could do more if you push it to the secular
I will never sacrifice the gospel for my art though
Yeah he doin well but I'm doing Wells Fargo
I can take the L
I met Jesus Christ I will never go to Hell
Holy Spirit in me he ain't never gonna fail
If you act Microsoft you ain't never gon' Excel
Mr. Turn the other cheek has struck again
But if you lose patience you ain't never gonna win
You only store wrath what you storin is concerning me
Cause both of us are storing but we storing for eternity
