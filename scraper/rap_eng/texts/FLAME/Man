(Verse 1: Flame)                                                                                                       Man you think you cool?
You've accomplished a lot (true)
Even put a man on the moon- astronaut
Even put a rocket up
Tell me how you pulled that off
Master of your faith, Captain of your soul
Knock it off
Yeah you gave us Shakespeare
Mark Twain and the Odyssey
Socrates, philosophies
The Iliad- was hot to me
Even built the Great Wall of China
And the Golden Gate Bridge see
Even took your first flight
Wright Brothers- 1903
Taj Mahal, Count of Scholars
The Pyramids, se Eiffel Tower
Worldwide cuisine- anything Italiana
Enchiladas, sushi, chicken tikka masala
Simply put- Man we blessed
Hope you read me homie- printing press
One day we blasting off- Apollo 11
Can't pay for your sin
It won't get you in Heaven
