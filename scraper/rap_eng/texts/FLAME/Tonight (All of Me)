Oh
I just wanna be/I just wanna be
Closer to Your heart/You will find me there
Everything I am/It's because of You
It's because of You/And now, we sing
Tonight/I'm giving You all of me
Tonight/I let go of everything
Tonight/I'm giving You all of me
Tonight/Tonight/Tonight
I give You all of me

Let's pray
Dear Father in the name/Of Your holy Son
I desire like Jesus/Prayed for us to be one
I desire to give/I desire to serve
I desire to love/Others with more than my words
Bless me to be humble/Bless me to be meek
I want to be a joy/When people come around me
Give me a gentle spirit/Bless me to be content
Please keep me from my sin/Let me quickly repent
Please give me discipline/Give me self control
To know when to stop/And when to say no
Make me a bold witness/Please remove fear
Replace it with faith/Pour out Your spirit here
Fill me up Lord/Let me overflow
Let me overdose/Make me holy/Keep me close
I want to give it all/Until there's none left
But I can't be too given/Look at Your Son's death

Oh
I just wanna be/I just wanna be
Closer to Your heart/You will find me there
Everything I am/It's because of You
It's because of You/And now, we sing
Tonight/I'm giving You all of me
Tonight/I let go of everything
Tonight/I'm giving You all of me
Tonight/Tonight/Tonight
I give You all of me

I can see You talking to high priest/Peter just denied You
For the second time/One more time he will deny You
One of the officers smacked You in the face/But he didn't understand that You were actually grace
But the people would rather see the release of a thief/Than to know forgiveness and be with the Prince of Peace
And as they screamed for Pilate to crucify You/I hear my own voice because every day I deny You
But yet You still bore the cross on Your vertebrae/Walking to Golgatha
What a display of grace
I see Your weakened body beaten/Can't keep me from crying
Your cross was very heavy/They gave it to Simon
Then You were crucified/They divided Your clothes
Like the Scriptures prophesied/You died and You rose
Two thousand years ago/Slaughtered on the tree
You gave all of You/I'm giving all of me

Oh
I just wanna be/I just wanna be
Closer to Your heart/You will find me there
Everything I am/It's because of You
It's because of You/And now, we sing
Tonight/I'm giving You all of me
Tonight/I let go of everything
Tonight/I'm giving You all of me
Tonight/Tonight/Tonight
I give You all of me

This I pray Lord/To be like Abraham
Ready to give it all/My only son as the lamb
Ready to sacrifice/Everything if You ask
Because nothing is mine/Not this life that I have
Everything I own/Oh Lord is a gift
So who am I/To hold it with a firm grip
I give You my talent/I give You my time
I give You my eyes/I give You my mind

Oh
I just wanna be/I just wanna be
Closer to Your heart/You will find me there
Everything I am/It's because of You
It's because of You/And now, we sing
Tonight/I'm giving You all of me
Tonight/I let go of everything
Tonight/I'm giving You all of me
Tonight/Tonight/Tonight
I give You all of me
