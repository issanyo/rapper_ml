[Chorus – Flame]
Used to run from him, but now I’m running for my God
Running for my God
Running for my God
Used to run from him, but now I’m running for my God
Running for my God
Running for my God

[Hook – Steve T]
Every time this record play, run it back
Hop up in the Word to run the plays like a running back
I’m moving, moving like I’m running track
Gotta stay busy ‘cause the Lord’s soon to come back
I’m running
I’m running
I’m running
I’m running
I’m running
I’m running
I’m running
I’m running
I’m running
I’m running
I’m running
I’m running
I’m running
I’m running
I’m running
What …

[Verse 1 – Steve T]
Aye I’m running for the Lord like it ain’t no tomorrow
Rain, sleet, hail, snow, I’m winning like Chicago
Yep, ‘cause I been called to the pavement
And you know for the Lord I run miles like Davis
These new shoes, call ‘em peace of the gospel
It’s a tough race but I die if I got to
And you know it’s only Jesus that I’m running for
Catch me on the move like I thought I heard the gun blow
And I sip that life water, never getting thirsty
Hop up in the Word and get Jackie Joyner-Kersee
‘Cause the track is his will and his will keep me going
Even though your boy ain’t never James Worthy
Now Taylor Swift started strong
But the one who endure till the end, he gon’ be on top
And Jesus said that we should all stay occupied
So what I look like letting time fly by?

[Hook – Steve T]
Every time this record play, run it back
Hop up in the Word to run the plays like a running back
I’m moving, moving like I’m running track
Gotta stay busy ‘cause the Lord’s soon to come back
I’m running
I’m running
I’m running
I’m running
I’m running
I’m running
I’m running
I’m running
I’m running
I’m running
I’m running
I’m running
I’m running
I’m running
I’m running
What …

[Verse 2 – Flame]
I’m here to promote, Jesus but I am not a publicist
I am just a light tryna show you where the rubbish is
The world is a trick filled with magicians
Rappers, actors, athletes, politicians
But imagine what can happen if we had a pile of Christians
Filled with the Spirit and with wisdom enter missions
But ain’t no intermission homie, you know what I’m talking ‘bout
Kids pullin’ nines out while we callin’ timeout
Gathering possessions, snacking on refreshments
While the world speaks, drinks like they need a breath mint
That’s why we need Jesus for biblical reflection
This your boy Flame, till he come see me reppin’
So many people follow Jesus for riches and caviar
Till I expire, told the Messiah I’m serving and working hard
‘Cause it’s true, you can recognize a tree by its fruit
And I’m tryna bear mine, no spare time

[Hook – Steve T]
Every time this record play, run it back
Hop up in the Word to run the plays like a running back
I’m moving, moving like I’m running track
Gotta stay busy ‘cause the Lord’s soon to come back

[Chorus – Flame]
Used to run from him, but now I’m running for my God
Running for my God
Running for my God
Used to run from him, but now I’m running for my God
Running for my God
Running for my God

[Hook – Steve T]
I’m running
I’m running
I’m running
I’m running
I’m running
I’m running
I’m running
I’m running
I’m running
I’m running
I’m running
I’m running
I’m running
I’m running
I’m running
What …
