[Hook: Mike Real & Flame]
Hands, hands, all I see is hands
The saints is in the building
We warned them in advance
And we ain’t goin' nowhere
We praise him ‘cause it’s necessary
So watch us turn this place into a sanctuary
Hands, hands, hands
Let me see them hands, hands, hands
Let me see them hands, hands, hands
Let me see them
Hold up
H-h-h-h-h-h-h-hold up

[Verse 1: Mike Real]
Jesus all on my brain (hold up)
Jesus all on my brain (hold up)
Christ is the big picture so it’s Jesus all in my frame (hold up)
Don’t you see that we ‘bout it
Living for Christ and we shout it
Who are y’all clowning
God is astounding, but they can’t see it
They vision is cloudy
So uh, what we gon’ do ‘bout that? What we gon’ do ‘bout that? Huh?
Look, we gon’ put his love on display
Bang it in our weight in rap
Hold up, we gon’ show ‘em the way, serving the Lord and you know we obey
We take over buildings
Look at his children, swinging from ceilings
Cirque du Soleil
Hold up, hold up, you mean to tell me you showed up
Just to tell us you ballin’
Plus you got the game sewn up?
So what, man we serve a God who is legendary
So watch us turn this place into a sanctuary

[Hook: Mike Real and Flame]
Hands, hands, all I see is hands
The saints are in the building
We warned them in advance
And we ain’t going nowhere
We praise him ‘cause it’s necessary
So watch us turn this place into a sanctuary
Hands, hands, hands
Let me see them hands, hands, hands
Let me see them hands, hands, hands
Let me see them
So watch us turn this place into a sanctuary

[Verse 2: Flame]
Look me in my face, I ain’t got no worries
‘Bout to turn this place into a sanctuary
But I need to see those hands up if you want what we on
Said I need to see those hands up if you in my zone
How we chillin’ when it’s hot in the building
I got that it’s God and his children
If we outside, then we go in
If we inside, then we go in
Hold up, ‘cause we are the saints
And everything we are got the Lord to thank
And everything we ain’t, we’re being sanctified, he fightin’ on our side like an army tank
Need I say that we are the church
But in Spanish "iglesia"
In the hood they say “church people”
But in the Greek it says “ecclesia”
And where we are, the Spirit is
Holy One’s household of faith
We bear the marks of the called and elect by the Good Shepherd, that’s a heavy weight
But as it relates to life and Godliness, boy, we got the royal flush
Was an orphan like orphan Annie
He upped the ante and adopted us
I’m ‘bout to work myself into a frenzy, God is in me contending, I’m about to bust
Turn a prison cell to a sanctuary
Paul, Silas, lock us up

[Hook]
Hands, hands, all I see is hands
The saints are in the building
We warned them in advance
And we ain’t going nowhere
We praise him ‘cause it’s necessary
So watch us turn this place into a sanctuary
Hands, hands, hands
Let me see them hands, hands, hands
Let me see them hands, hands, hands
Let me see them
So watch us turn this place into a sanctuary

[Bridge: Mike Real]
So what we gon’ do right now? What we gon’ do right now? Huh?
What we gon’ do right now? What we ‘bout to do right now? Whoo!
So what we gon’ do right now? What we gon’ do right now?
So watch us turn this place into a sanctuary

[Hook]
Hands, hands, all I see is hands
The saints are in the building
We warned them in advance
And we ain’t going nowhere
We praise him ‘cause it’s necessary
So watch us turn this place into a sanctuary
Hands, hands, hands
Let me see them hands, hands, hands
Let me see them hands, hands, hands
Let me see them
So watch us turn this place into a sanctuary
