[Begining]
Hands up in the building
Hands up in the building
Royal...Flush...

[Hook: Serge]
Got my face to the ground
Hands to the heavens
In the sky, arms like elevens
I don't know, if you got that feelin'
Like you, like you
About to br-br-br-break the building, turn up!

[Verse 1: Flame]
I still go cray, I still go nuts
I still turn up! Boy, I spaz!
Ain't nothin changed but the clock on the wall
Still want them all to come and meet my Dad?
Still want them all to come and meet my God?
Still got that urgency in my soul
Still got the fire burning for the Gospel message to penetrate the whole globe!
Ah!
This is the reason I stepin' to fools!
To tell you truth it is deeper than art
The way that I see it is deeper than rap
The reason I snap, I speak to the heart
God's saving grace, you know He done it
Come face to face I know He got it

[Hook: Serge]
Got my face to the ground
Hands to the heavens
In the sky, arms like elevens
I don't know, if you got that feelin'
Like you, like you
About to br-br-br-break the building, turn up!

[Verse 2: Flame]
You see? He's the reason I do it
Cause ain't nobody else out there then done it
(then put) my punishment on His back
(took back) For the team that kept it one hunned
Can anbody tell me how they gonna get it
It's the ones ready that won't even go
Girl, you got it, but won't tell anybody, yell everbody, but you never about to do a reproach
(deal with it)
Let me ask you this?
Do you show up where the action is?
We're actively, trapped in the back and where accurate facts and the pack of the blasphemous
It's obvious I'm not a pacifist, a Fashionist, I've never been
But I stay clothed in righteousness, and then like fashion, I want to match Him
(He just like) Where that cross at? I want to pick up mine
Shout out to those who don't use the bible
In their lives as a pick up line
Kudosss! Yeah, witness time, People ain't tryin' to read minds (Na)
So I let them see what I'm saying
(like what?) Like a picket sign

[Hook: Serge]
Got my face to the ground
Hands to the heavens
In the sky, arms like elevens
I don't know, if you got that feelin'
Like you, like you
About to br-br-br-break the building, turn up!

[Bridge: Serge]
Like I'm bout to break the buildin' boy (x9)

[Outro: Flame]
