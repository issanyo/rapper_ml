A Christianity that is without friction in the culture is a Christianity that dies
The gospel we have is a missionary gospel, one that must connect to those on the outside in order to have life
Our call is to an engaged alienation a Christianity that preserves the distinctiveness of our gospel while not retreating  from our callings as neighbors friends and citizens. The test to move forward will be if we can engage the culture without losing the gospel.- Russell Moore
