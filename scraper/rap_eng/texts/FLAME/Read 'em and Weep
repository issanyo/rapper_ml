He set us up to weep
There ain't no habit we can't shake
No addiction we can't kick
No personality trait
That can keep us in them chains
Boy, I'm breaking out of mine
Sayonara to the world
Gotta leave it all behind
We really dead to the flesh
When it's knockin' at the door
We ain't gotta say yes
We got the power to say no
So we do not lose heart
Though our bodies waste away
Our inner man is bearing new
Day by day

Read em and weep, boy
Show me everything
See that Ace up on my King
Nothing higher than my Jesus
Read em and weep
Cause He's giving me the best hand
Giving us the best, and
There's nothing that can beat us

He set us up to weep

He set us up to weep
Aka the means of grace
Lord's supper
Bible great
Fast faith
Ain't no sickness in the body
No disease will prevail
Tell me death, where's your sting?
Ain't no demon down in hell
Tell me, who can throw this game?
Can't nobody throw Him off
Where His enemies at?
Man, they they Parkay butter soft
Glad He put me on the team
And He did not pass me up
He's the dealer, dealing hands
And gave the saints the Royal Flush

He started from the bottom
But He was at the top too
So winning ain't a problem
I lay my cards out on the table
He gave me everything I need
That's how He set it up to be
When He took the place for me, ayy
So watch me brag about my King
And enjoy this winning streak
As I tell you, read em

Read em and weep, boy
Show me everything
See that Ace up on my King
Nothing higher than my Jesus
Read em and weep
Cause He's giving me the best hand
Giving us the best, and
There's nothing that can beat us

He set us up to weep

See, He set us up to weep
Gave us heaven as our hope
No more sin, suffering
Put me in, let me go
Pure perfection in that place
No temptation in that place
No mistakes are in that place
Singing "Holy, Holy, Holy"
See, we're casting down our crowns
All the credit goes to Him
He's the hero, He's the star
We played our part
But in the end
All my righteousness is His
My obedience is His
All the good I've ever done
All the glory goes to Him

Read em and weep, boy
Show me everything
See that Ace up on my King
Nothing higher than my Jesus
Read em and weep
Cause He's giving me the best hand
Giving us the best, and
There's nothing that can beat us
