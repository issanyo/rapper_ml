Yea, it's a lot of suffering going on in this world
A lot more than what we see in America
I think it's just healthy to be aware
So I want to take you with me
As we travel the globe
And see the problems and see the pain
And see our only hope
Is through Jesus Christ
To redeem our world, let's go

See it's more suffering in the world
Than we see on the streets
Open your eyes step away from MTV
See into CNN and see in the Middle East
Places like Iraq, Iran, the UAE
See the murder
The rape
Religions
The pain
The terror
The poverty diseases in the veins
See our desperate need for change as we travel the globe
And see our only hope is Jesus grabbing a soul
Look at Africa actually one of the places
Where 24 million people living with AIDS is
Where rape is half of the women experience violence
Orphans guerilla warfare break the silence
Vulnerable African children go hungry
While we in the states we waste money
12 years olds traded for sex
We need Jesus what type of suffering is next
Even Europe has problems
Think a place like Greece
Where they smuggle Cannabis and heroin from the Middle East
The assaults the car theft and drug offenses
Illicit drugs and rape exist
Though they can never rate with the USA
We number 1 on the list for most criminal cases
Though we living in the free land and free to vote
But yet we still slaves to sin?
Welcome to I-N-D-I-A
Where 63 out of a thousand children die before the age of 5
5.1 million people with AIDS alive
Mad pollution in the Asian sky
Millions of children live and they work and on the streets
One of the poorest countries that this world will ever see
And 10 million babies died from abortions in two decades
That's more of a reason for you to get saved
Look at China and see the way they treat the females
They drown them and poison them
I give you the details
It overwhelms me the magnitude of they sinning
When over 60 million babies never grow to be women
Violent crimes on the rise prostitution is rising
Drug addition plus they persecuting they Christians
The most populated country with 3 billion people
Needs to look up so they can see the point like a steeple
In Israel
Terrorism is real
Can't imagine the amounts of blood that gets spilled
Many people displaced from the bombs dropping
Judaism Christianity Islam's doctrine
Civil war taking place in the Holy land
While peoples homes getting crushed like a soda can
As the children sit and watch the crossfire
Other countries plead for peace to cease fire
Jamaica Wah Gwan
I guess I get to tell
15 percent of the people have sickle cell
In this third world where gang violence is
It's prevalent, it's evident all the Godlessness
The drug traffic ganja and cocaine
With so much cocaine you can skid on a slope main
But when Jesus Christ died recognize that hope came
So fight the sex trade and racism for sho main
See in Cuba people submerged in repression in fear
From 48 years Fiedel Castro is their Prime Minister Counsel of ministers
Also referred to as Premier
Prostitution is high and the crime is too
Can't express your ideas like you and I can do
In America democracy is what we're use to
But I'm just trying to remind you that
See it's more suffering in the world than we see on the streets
Open your eyes step away from MTV
Sin to sin in the sea in the Middle East
Places like Iraq, Iran, the UAE
See the murder
The rape
Religions
The pain
The terror
The poverty diseases in the veins
See our desperate need for change as we travel the globe
And see our only hope is Jesus grabbing a soul
