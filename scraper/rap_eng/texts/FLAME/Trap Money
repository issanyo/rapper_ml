Trap money good but the wrath only pilin'
Trap money good but the wrath only pilin'
Trap money good but the wrath only pilin'
Trap money- trap money- wrath only pilin'

[Verse 1: Thi'sl]
He say he paid the cost to be the boss
He want that new Bent, top off
He say he burn the block, hot sauce
He say the world is his, but look at what it cost
See his daddy was a dope boy, uncle was a dope boy, brother was a dope boy
Sister was a dope girl, cousin was a dope boy, only thing that he knew was dope boy
Now everybody that I named in jail or dead
It's like the devil puttin' that money on they head
See the trap money good, but the wrath is pilin'
You and God got beef, you don't want them problems
'Cause while we gettin' it fast, that money good
But believe me it won't help you when they put you in that wood

[Hook: Young Noah]
Trap money good but the wrath only pilin'
Trap money good but the wrath only pilin'
Trap money good but the wrath only pilin'
Trap money- trap money- wrath only pilin'

[Verse 2: Young Noah]
Back in the day I had a lot of pay, but then I got saved, took a pay cut - by the way, I'm still blessed
Money can solve some problems, but if you're on the wrong side when he crack that sky
It's gonna be grotesque, it's gonna be a hot mess, surrounded by dead flesh
Eternally hopeless, you better listen to the sound of the Holy Ghost stumping bumping jumping up in your chest
That money won't last, it'll pass like gas, it'll fade like grass fast
Whiplash in your face like car crash if you keep on living in darkness
Homeboy, I know you ain't heartless, Rick Ross done fed you that garbage
This is not a diss, this is just a word for the dope boy trapping and rapping dealing with life challenges
All I'm trying to tell them is, they can be better then, they can be better men
Lawyers, doctors, high school lettermen, why you settlin' for the same thing locked up your partner then?
Why would you follow them? Why would you model them?
They ain't did nothing but fail, and Jesus Christ I pray you follow him

[Hook: Young Noah]
Trap money good but the wrath only pilin'
Trap money good but the wrath only pilin'
Trap money good but the wrath only pilin'
Trap money- trap money- wrath only pilin'

[Verse 3: Flame]
I see you in these streets out here trying to get it
You never sleep trying to triple your digits
I know your motto is "money over everything"
Mr. Ice Cream Man moving hurricane
You got that trap money, got you feeling hood rich
Got you feeling good with racks on racks and hood chicks
But after that you could get caught up with some Fed time
Or God forbid they hit the kid with rat-a-tat tat bedtime
Or worse than that you keep trapping, Oscar winner keep acting
Like you don't hear the Lord calling, one day he's gon' wreak havoc
Ask the real Rick Ross, all that money can get lost
God's gon' ask how you respond to his Son on a bloody cross

[Hook: Young Noah]
Trap money good but the wrath only pilin'
Trap money good but the wrath only pilin'
Trap money good but the wrath only pilin'
Trap money- trap money- wrath only pilin'
