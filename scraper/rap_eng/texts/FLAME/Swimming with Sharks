{Verse 1}
I been lied on blackballed never said a thing wait
Wait let me set the scene it's been over ten years now
Swimming in the water with great white tiger like
Hammer head sharks I've been overlooked underpaid
Never said a thing seen brother kill brother like
Abel and Cain everything ain't what it seems
When you see behind the scenes it's a pretty scary thing
When you see who pulling strings I done seen them sharp teeth
Looking deep in the sharks eyes all I could do is pray
I was prey in the sharks eyes I just wanna rap for God
Wanna see some people saved but I am so afraid
If my publishing saved see royalty pave this they break up
Royalty's fakeness since I started in the basement
I've been royalty shaded I got power doom
Threatened to blackball you know who you are
Cause I said I wouldn't sign with y'all why you wanna
See the flame fall is that what you in the game for
Some people that doubt us game over you should really be
Ashamed you can be a pain need to be tamed
Dang bro take my kindness as weakness
Up execs said to tweet this
Have to tweet this rapping less about Jesus
It's overwhelming the greed just when you see
All the greediness capitalism at it's finest well
You can break the glass ceiling be a slave and
Just sign this

{Verse 2}
Swimming in this industry ain't just with the fishes
You swimming with the bloodthirsty fame seeking
Vicious cold hearted selfish minded sneaky
Opportunist who will call another venue and then tell em they be foolish
Tell them they be foolish if they whoop you
Cause they always bring a better show
If you coming in this ocean even if you got a boat
There's some people that's aboard that's ready to
Overthrow if you don't know how to swim at least
You better float cause these sharks smell weakness
They'll eat you alive I know that you was thinking
That we doing this for God well surprise
Certain guys coming for your neck
Bring something to the table
They'll steal your connect take credit for it
Discredit you and benefit from your blood
The smell starts it's liable to disrespect
We would rather this see a threat and keep going
All on and you see them jaws out
Better know them jaws out woo

{Chorus}
What I been through only God Knows
All them long nights only God Knows
Will I be alright only God Knows
Got me questioning the life here that I chose
What I been through only God Knows
All them long nights only God Knows
Will I be alright only God Knows
I'm just trying to stay afloat

{Verse 3}
Yeah so much slander so much dealing
While you swimming guard your heart
May you never compromise fall apart
And become a shark every time
When they plot my demise, and they scheme
Then I cry Most High and my God intervenes
With a ram and a bush and He fights all my battles
And they rob and they push with all their might
But it don't matter cause He guards shields
Rescues saves you just stay faithful
Pray pray you'll get your reward
Don't you ever change
Focus on the Lord yeah
Keep preaching His grace
Keep telling the world that our Jesus saves
And we'll be rescued and it's all gonna pass away
Just keep it pushing, like

{Outro}
Just keep swimming just keep swimming
Just keep swimming just keep swimming
Just keep swimming just keep swimming
Just keep swimming just keep swimming
