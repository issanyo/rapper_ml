She's always dancin' like every little chance she gets
And little man can't wait to get his hands on the whip
They don't understand life nor the issue of sin
But they know the article and the issue that 50 was in
You should hear them spit little man is always tryin' to battle rap
I'm like follow me to the scriptures see where the battle's at
But you can't you're watching College Hill
I guess you drop your cup and let the knowledge spill
I'm lookin' for the convicted to see who's new on the team
And tired of doing what they do on the screen
In other words, tryin' to see the ones that Jesus drafted
No matter what round pick you were still engrafted
You ain't gotta walk miles for cheesecake to be down with the squad
Faith through grace will get you signed with God
So let Him hear you say "I wanna be like Christ"
He'll change the person's life, after hearin' the sinner pray

Look at baby girl is cute as a baby doll
It's hard to reach her cause she's tuned into cable now
She's watchin' videos starin' at all of the boys
She's a sinner she doesn't know about Jesus' joy
Yet she knows about the clothes and the latest fashion
She should be on MTV news with the latest action
About what's goin' on lately in the industry
But she's clueless about Jesus' ministry
She doesn't know her and God are still enemies
Separated by nature now there's enmity
She's so silly you should see her dance
Only thing that I'm prayin' is that she sees her chance
To meet the One with the world in His hands
Personally as her Savior and start takin' a stand
Begin to advance and stop chasin' a man
I wanna be like Christ
Is what the Father is waitin' to hear the young lady sayin'

You can't claim to be a Laker rockin' white and red
See those are Rockets we headed with the righteous dead
That's a category mistake like a solo group
You can't take to the grave those Manolo boots
Advice to you look to His life and the blood that He shed
The sin price cost Him more than an arm and a leg
And we ain't preachin' wrap it up
You wouldn't have to deliver if you put the package up
Get it? Everybody is lookin' for somethin' to be like
But other somethings are nothing unless it be Christ
The Bible instructs us we sinners and can't see light
Our direction is left and sinners can't see right
I can't wait til we finish and get to see Christ
Mike is retired seek the Messiah I wanna be like Christ
That's the only person God wants us to be like
