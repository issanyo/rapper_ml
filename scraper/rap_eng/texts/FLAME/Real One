[Verse 1]
From these times now and back down to Biblical days
Counterfeit Jesus' have raised in the ages
Search the pages of the Biblion the Holy Bible not the holy quran
No, Jesus warns us what would come after
Matthew the 24th chapter
For many will come in my name sayin' 'I am the Christ'
But they're really actors
Woe unto those who chose and teach us
A non-Biblical Jehovah Jesus
Woe, they might use the name but read in anotha' meanin'
We must put a stop to the doctrine of demons
I must run this it might get hostile
We don't want the Christ of Oneness Pentecostals
We want the incarnate Christ of the apostles
The pre-existent Son, the One of the gospel

[Hook]
We want the Real One, I teach the GodMan homie
Represented through Christians is the real Jesus
We want the Real One, I preach the GodMan whoodi
Represent the authentic and real Jesus
We want the Real One, I teach the GodMan son
Represented through Christians is the real Jesus
We want the Real One, I preach the GodMan dirty
Represent the authentic and real Jesus

[Verse 2]
You're bound to drown in a broken ship
If your hope is in the Jesus of Joseph Smith
Woe, that doctrine will have your life stormin'
Come to the knowledge of Christ and not to the one of the Mormons
Jesus is not Lucifer's spiritual brother
And the heavenly Father did not have sex with his mother
Mary, scary I seen them two dudes in my hood
Tellin' me God was a man at first and progressed to His Godhood
No, eternal is the Godhead
The Father has always been God that's what the 90th Psalm says
Keep your eyes on Jehovah's Witness
Who mistranslate 1 and 1 of John in the Holy Scriptures
They say more to get your mind tangled
They deny Jesus is God but the incarnate Michael the archangel
If no angel was called the Son in Hebrews 1
Then why is Jesus called the Son?

[Verse 3]
Brace yourself, dawg I'm 'bout to make it heavy
If you follow the Jesus of Mary Baker Eddy
She's the Christian Science founder
The devil roamed around like a roaring lion
I guess that he found her
Her Jesus was just another man
Who showed the way to become spiritually advanced
Her god was infinte mind
And that man was sinless and he was never dying
What does the Bible say? In Romans 3 that all have sinned
Romans 2 the conscious bears witness within
Roman 1 they know the God that made the land but they suppress the truth because they wicked men
And Muslims try to make the claim that Mohammed fulfilled Deuteronomy eighteen (18:15)
No, Jesus was more than a prophet
The One that died and rose and told Thomas to touch Him

[Outro]
We talkin' bout the Jesus that existed before time, man
The one that they call the Angel of the Lord in the Old Testament
The one that's 100% man, 100% God, you feel me
The one that lived a perfect life for sinners
You know, fulfilled the Law, the one that was crucified and died for sinners
The one that resurrected and rose to the skies
You hear me, the one that's at the right hand of the Father
And the one that's coming back, you feel me
