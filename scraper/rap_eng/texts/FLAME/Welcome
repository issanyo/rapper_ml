Welcome to a place where the guns don't pop
But a place where the fun don't stop
Homie
To a place where Jesus be
And we don't even need a Jesus piece
Homie
Welcome
To a place where we follow the Bible and we don't even need jars of dro
Homie and ain't nobody tryna grind for shine
Cause Jesus is the star of the show
And that's real

You ask us where the guns at homie where the weed at
We like kill that homeboy we don't need that
Instead of the heat we'll be where G-O-D's at
So we reachin' out with open arms like where your sleeves at
I notice something cats'll die for they reputation
They rather die disin' God and to get with Satan
But on this side we collide in anticipation
Of Jesus' second coming written in Revelation
We don't grip steel sell crack none of that
We live life in light of the fact He's coming back
So while they squeeze clips blood crip gang banging
East coast west coast down south slanging
Midwest nina poppin'seein' Jesus hangin'
On the cross resurrected' and you still thinkin'
That you cool without His grace is crazy
Its a slap to the face of the God who made me and you

Welcome to a place where the guns don't pop
But a place where the fun don't stop
Homie
To a place where Jesus be
And we don't even need a Jesus piece
Homie
Welcome
To a place where we follow the Bible and we don't even need jars of dro
Homie and ain't nobody tryna grind for shine
Cause Jesus is the star of the show
And that's real

We kissed the world goodbye
And its love for women its love for sinning
Simply because His love is in us
We kissed the world goodbye
And its music too that music's confused dudes like a rubrics cube
Homienow we pluggin' into Christian rap
So many lyrics about Christ a make a Christian snap
And wanna spread love to a thug with a nine milli
And I ain't playin' this time dirty and I'm silly
And every movie and commercial that makes fun of us
Like South Park with wicked hearts that come up
And comic view and Islamic dudes that do it too
One day the Bible say they'll pay homage too
The very King that they mocked and laughed at
The Bible says at they very plots He laughs back
So we gone love our enemies and we gone have fun
As we patiently wait on the return of the Son
Homie
