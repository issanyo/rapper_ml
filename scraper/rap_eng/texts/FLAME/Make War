[Intro: John Piper]
I hear so many Christians, murmuring.. about their imperfections
And their failures, and their addictions and their shortcomings
And I see so little war! Murmur murmur murmur...'why am I this way?'
MAKE WAR!

[Verse 1:Tedashii]
Bang with me
Bang Bang Ba-Bang with me
Never playin' games man cause this this thing can get frisky!
So man if you in Christ, take up your cross quickly!
Stand fearless on the frontline -Time to come with it (Ey!)
Do the right thing
Wake up and let's get it
I ain't even in the ring, they're throwin' bows like Riddick (Who?)
Persistently attacking me they even in the back of me
Its either fight or loose your life
And I can't take this passively
So what you think I'm bout to do?
I'm bout to do what I can do
Trust the One who got me through and fight like it was after school
Never giving up, steady standing on the battlefield
Feet firm to the ground like I stepped on Chapel Hill
Flesh feelin' frisky, sin persuades and tempts me
Satan cheers me on-guilt followed by conviction
Its the same old trap, and we fall like we're defenseless
Work your senses, grow in wisdom
Stand firm and be relentless

[Chorus: Tedashii & Flame]
I make WAAARRR
Cause sin never sleeps
Its got me in a trance
You can see it in my dreams
I make WAAARRR
Man I beat my flesh- to the death
Every breath like I beat my chest
I make war
Sun up
I make war
Sun down
I make war
Time in
I make war
Time out
I make war
Against lust
I make war
Against pride
I make war
Against me
I make war
Till I die

[Verse 2: Flame]
Do YOU even have a clue what happened to you when He died?
When that tomb got rolled?
When He rose in the sky?
I think we emphasize sin so much
That it makes us paralyzed
And glorify struggle so much
That it makes us terrified
And DE-emphasize the fact that we have been sterilized
From our old lives and thus
God, this ain't never wise!
We gotta snap out of it, we ain't in no straight jackets (We free!)
When Jesus died, in our lives something strange happened
He gave us power, yeah I know that we're sinners
But since He rose He's renewing the image of God in us
Now we gotta start makin' WAR
Now we can start sayin' NO
To the fleshly impulses that Jesus Christ was paying for
Now we can start taking the lead just like the Dalai Lama
And start going all out just like a suicide bomber!
Whatever the sin is we gotta go go go harder
By His grace, no time to waste
Jus-jus-just like there's no tomorrow

[Chorus: Tedashii & Flame]
I make WAAARRR
Cause sin never sleeps
Its got me in a trance
You can see it in my dreams
I make WAAARRR
Man I beat my flesh- to the death
Every breath like I beat my chest
I make war
Sun up
I make war
Sun down
I make war
Time in
I make war
Time out
I make war
Against lust
I make war
Against pride
I make war
Against me
I make war
Till I die

[Verse 3: Tedashii]
I'm a Christ REPPER-senter, finna stand and deliver!
A lot of my BE-lievers struggle with their agenda
I drop this on a ADAT, just so you could come playback
A hit to be encouraged that rocks you with truth from way back!
Listen to it asap!
Like you do a Lecrae track
I'm spittin written visions to put on heads like a wave cap
Sinning? Nah we don't play that
That's the way that a slave acts
I'm filled with the spirit and tell 'em dawg 'this is payback!'
As you begin to copy the carbon copies of Christ
And conform to his written image you should be shining the light
If you're not, why is that?
Is it fear that's been grippin' you cause you scared they'll be dissin you
Flippin' birds while they spit at you?
If you're not, why is that?
It don't matter so bump it
Perfect love cast out fear - He ain't save us for nothin'
This is a priviledge (Priviledge)
Your life to give to Him (Give to Him)
So stand firm for him dawg and lets get it in, uhh!

[Chorus: Tedashii & Flame]
I make WAAARRR
Cause sin never sleeps
Its got me in a trance
You can see it in my dreams
I make WAAARRR
Man I beat my flesh- to the death
Every breath like I beat my chest
I make war
Sun up
I make war
Sun down
I make war
Time in
I make war
Time out
I make war
Against lust
I make war
Against pride
I make war
Against me
I make war
Till I die
