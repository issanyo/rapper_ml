[Verse One]
I question myself yo' Flame why are you tryin'
To live without the Lion of Judah inside you are dyin'
Not communin' with the God of Mount Zion
Can't you see you're denyin'
The very God they can't break down to a science
I know you're young and you see some things that you think you are missin'
Man you trippin' you're missin' nothin' get back on your mission
You followed the flesh next you would wallow in mess
Don't let thinkin' bout sex throw you back like a you're Mitchell and Ness
Don't get weary in your well-doin'
You were doin' well until you let your well ruin and run dry
Tryin' to fulfill them selfish ambitions
Making sinful decisions without repentance leaves only contention
Don't forget you're a professin' Christian
Them lyrics you've written-
They don't mean nothin' unless they match your livin'
No one ever received elevation
Dibblin' And dabblin' and rappin' with procrastination

[Chorus]
How long has it been since we've communicated
Oh Lord I'm tired of sin it keeps me humiliated
So much sin in the world we in and I've been regenerated
Oh Lord I need Jesus, Jesus, Jesus oh, how long has it been?

[Verse Two]
I haven't been girded with the full armor
I've deserted your Word it turned to nervousness and then full drama
It's better for me to have never known
Than to know the truth and turn back to what is wrong
That's like spewin' from my own stomach
Then turnin' around and eatin' my own vomit
When I've been made clean and I don't mean Comet
Lord break me abase me make me face holiness
Shake me shape me make me face loneliness
Redeem me rescue this vessel press through
So much just to get next to you it's stressful
It helps to confess my test it's just to bless you
Disconnected I need to connect to you
Where can I go to escape from your presence
You're omnipresent you're present in hell and present in heaven
Plus I'm weary and wounded, my theory's consumed in
Iniquity's union my history is sick with influence

[Chorus]
How long has it been since we've communicated
Oh Lord I'm tired of sin it keeps me humiliated
So much sin in the world we in and I've been regenerated
Oh Lord I need Jesus, Jesus, Jesus oh, how long has it been?

[Verse Three]
Lord let these broken bones rejoice in a song
Givin' you glory until I get home
Never takin' my freedom and overthrow your authority on the throne
Livin' it holy until I get home
Desperate measures will I take from now on
To stay away from what I'm knowin' is wrong
Selfcontrol because my suffering is long
No more will I ignore the fact that it's on
Prayin' until you come back for your own
I'm fearfully and I'm wonderfully made
Elected and affected by your irresistible grace
And Lord that means something
Take my heart and then clean something
Make me mature and help me endure please
Deliver me from the guilt and the filth, find me on my knees
Knelt down about to put my face to the ground
When I start renewin' my mind it'll lessen the times I have to sing

[Chorus - 2X]
