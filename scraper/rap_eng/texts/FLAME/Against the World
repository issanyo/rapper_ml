Turn it down a little bit I don't want to hear it
It's gonna be me and Him against the world
(4x)

Cause it's you and me against the world the world the world
They ask me
Do you love Him enough that you would really give up the world?

It's been too long I can't live this life no more
With all of your lies I can't run from right no more
He took on flesh for me all you took was my joy
He played his role perfectly you played me like a toy
I'm so done with you I got my bags packed
I'm burning my bridges case you try to drag me back
Someone got me loose here you can have your noose
You're like a brown recluse I'm chucking up the deuce through

They told me it wouldn't last
They said it would never work
They told me this love would pass
But it's you and me against the world
They told me to leave You now
You're only with Him 'cause you're hurt
But I'm gonna stand my ground
Cause it's You and me against the world the world the world
They ask me
Do you love Him enough that you would really give up the world?

I did the stupidest things for you all in the name of staying true
Embarrassing myself had me acting like a fool and
What did I get in return and what did I get in exchange
Besides teary eyes broken hearts and lots of pain
Tried to hold on to what we had but it was never real and
The one who loved me the most man I helped him get killed man
Messing around with you left millions of regrets yet
The love that I rejected eventually resurrects
See although I played him blatantly betrayed him
He said see that guy right there I'm gonna save him
That's exactly what He did after the perfect life was lived
Crucified He would rise now I'm one of His kids
Now I'm head over heels although His got brooms
Me and you against the world Jesus Christ we can't lose
He's crushing heads yes that means I'm crushing too
When I say this Lord is true

Cause it's you and me against the world the world the world
They ask me
Do you love Him enough that you would really give up the world?

I can tell your searching let me show you what to find
You can trust me I won't lie
Come now don't be stupid
Why would you leave this behind
You're not going anywhere your mine

I'm going I'm leaving everything
Cause He He is my everything
And He gave it all up for me
And that's something you'll never know

They told me it wouldn't last
They said it would never work
They told me this love would pass
But it's you and me against the world
They told me to leave You now
You're only with Him 'cause you're hurt
But I'm gonna stand my ground
Cause it's You and me against the world the world the world
They ask me
Do you love Him enough that you would really give up the world? (2x)
If you really wanna know
I love Him enough that I would really give up the world
