[Chorus: NF]
Everybody’s got a blank page
A story they’re writing today
A wall that they’re climbing
You can carry the past on your shoulders
Or you can start over
Regrets, no matter what you goin’ through
Jesus, He gave it all to save you
He carried the cross on His shoulders
So you can start over

[Verse 1: Flame]
Don’t let your heart be troubled
Don’t be afraid
To the broken hearted that wishes that they’d
Never been born, never been torn, never sinned, never disobeyed
I know you think there’s no hope, but that ain’t true (Jesus saves!)
 I know you feelin’ regret
(Like I) brought this all on myself
(Like I) messed it up big time, and this time I don’t deserve God’s help
(Thinking) how can God forgive me after knowin’ what I did (can He?)
After knowin’ that I hid from Him, and I stayed away and backslid
(Listen) Jesus came for the sick (so true)
Jesus came for the weak (amen)
Jesus came to give good news and to set the captives free (amen)
Jesus came for the poor (amen)
Jesus came with the keys (amen)
Jesus came to remove the chains so the prisoners are released

[Chorus: NF]
Everybody’s got a blank page

Regrets, no matter what you goin’ through

He carried the cross on His shoulders
So you can start over

[Verse 2: Flame]
See, His love is deeper than the ocean floor
Run to His arms like an open door
God the Father sent the Son
So men can come and be free and ain’t gotta run no more (that's what he said)
Come to me, all who are weary; with heavy burdens, I’ll give you rest
Separated you from the sin, as far as the east is from the west (he said)
Thrown in the sea of forgetfulness
What sin? What offense?
And when them waves come crashing in, I’ll calm the winds in your defense (that's what he said)
So, whatever it is that you’ve done
He put that punishment on His Son (he said)
You’ll never come under His condemnation, conquer sin and Satan and his accusations
So, dry your eyes, lift up your head
Hallelujah! God is not dead! (amen)
Plus He gave us His peace, and He took our guilt on the cross instead
Took our place and now we embrace
A clean slate with the eyes of faith
We know unfailing love, unfailing love, it’s not too late, start over

[Chorus: NF]
