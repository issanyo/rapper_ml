(Hook)
You see the lights cameras looking like we bought to go hammer
One thing that's for sure I am not the one to rock the show
They show up they show out [repeats]

(Lecrae)
Hey beat check bass check microphone check too
But none of that matters let the spirit come check you
So I play the background I know when to back down
Out here going hammer like Jesus is coming back now
I don't want the glory either why you think I go hard
Tell you like I tell my barber bro I don't want no part
Homie what's in your heart pride off in your pocket
You want all the credit boy what's in your wallet?
Sorry I can't control myself I lost it I ain't bout to lose it
Oops please pardon me for all this Jesus juice that I been spewing
Ruining my good shirt, stomping got my foot hurt
Crucified for all my sins ya they call that woodwork
I spit loud as I walking round if you jump but that don't work
Like Elijah call down fire from the sky, fireworks
Fire words at these people pray evil would be restrained
Lord we need you so we calling on your name like the Flame

(Hook)

(Flame)
Paradise was lost Adam why you wreck it?
Messing round with trees and found out that he was naked
Then sin entered in boy I got a message Jesus
That they all infected and protection's been rejected
So I'm standing on stages off and on on these jets
Flight attendant is tripping just like she bout to flex
But I am not tripping on the way to a show
Gotta tell em bout Jesus cause they need to know
Oh no it really ain't about me bro
I shouldn't have to say that though what you think He saved me for
So that I can get on stage and the crowd get amazed and they pay me dough? (Never)
So this smiles on my face when I step in the place and I say hello? (Never)
I'm gonna preach this grace I'm a teach this grace then I say let's go
I don't have a heaven and I don't have a hell
I can't put you in either but He surely will
Jesus stepped on the scene showed up on the cross
Showed out when He rose He did both for the lost

(Hook)
