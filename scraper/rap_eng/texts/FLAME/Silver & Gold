[Pre-Chorus: Flame & Melinda Watts]
We gon live by the call
That's the only way we know

[Chorus]
I'd rather have Jesus than silver and gold
Everybody chasing after dollars but I'd rather have Jesus
Than silver and gold
When I'm chasing after Jesus
They chasing silver and gold everybody chasing after money
But I'd rather have Jesus than silver and gold

[Verse 1]
He said he would ride for the bag
Said he even would kill said he would lie for the bag
Man your Bible he will said he would die for it
Said he'd ride for it make the block look like July 4th
Your mamas cry for it even if you rack it up and stack it up
It ain't gonna save nah cause when you add it up
You subtracting it ain't gon' pray aww cursing my rap
Know that I'm saved making minimum wage
At least my sins have been paid for guess I'm just trying to say

[Chorus]
I would rather have Jesus than silver and gold
Everybody chasing after dollars but I'd rather have Jesus
Than silver and gold woo yeah
Man I'm chasing after Jesus than chasing silver and gold uh
Everybody chasing after money but I'd rather have Jesus
Than silver and gold uh than gold than gold than gold

[Verse 2: Flame & Melinda Watts]
Rich man holding onto money trying to maintain
Broke man trying to get the money doing anything
Middle class see that little bag and then it fade away
But when you getting tinting price you cool with it either way
