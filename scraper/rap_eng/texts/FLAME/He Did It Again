(Intro: AD3)                                                                                             He did it... oh yes Then He delivered me He has forgiven me

(Verse 1: Flame)                                                                                           Yeah, your boy was lost
I was out of my mind
Refusing to come to the cross
Although it was crossing my mind
I'm glad He saved me though
No telling where I would be
If I'd be dead or alive
But there is no goodness in me
It is the truth I was dead in my sin
But God had predestined me to be His son
God had elected me to be his son
It's only by faith alone through Christ alone
It was His own sovereign choice
That He would snatch me up out of the grave
Picked me up, turned me around, now I am saved

(Chorus: AD3)                                                                                                           (He did it again) He rescued me from sin
(He did it again) He saved me now I'm born again
(He did it again) He made me a part of His plan
Blinded my misery Then He delivered me He has forgiven me I've got the victory

(Verse 3: Flame & AD3)                                                                                       You got the position and ready to go
The enemy thought he had us in the bag
But if you are Christian then let the world know
That they can be free and be cool with our Dad
But not only free, that they can be how
He hung on the tree for saving us all
So they can return and find their purpose
They can return and finally know that

Tell 'em what they are all missing out on
Tell 'em His grace is sufficient and strong (4x)
Tell 'em His grace is sufficient and strong
Tell 'em His grace is sufficient and strong

(Chorus: AD3 & Flame)                                                                                        (He did it again) He rescued me from sin
(He did it again) He saved me now I'm born again
(He did it again) He made me a part of His plan
Blinded my misery Then He delivered me He has forgiven me I've got the victory

You don't know everything I have been through
You don't know everything I have been through
You don't know everything I have been through
(What can I say, but You're faithful)

I was bound and chained in darkness
The enemy had me He had me
But You came with the keys and set me free
(Verse 3 : Flame)                                                                                                         You didn't have to do it, Lord But I'm glad You did
You could have passed me by and left me dead in my sins
I'm so thankful, grateful Praise You grateful
Thank you you're so mighty to save
What can I say but You're faithful?                                                               (Chorus: AD3 & Flame)                                                                                   (He did it again) He rescued me from sin                                               (He did it again) He saved me now I'm born again                                         (He did it again) He made me a part of His plan                                       Blinded my misery Then He delivered me He has forgiven me I've got the victory You don't know everything I have been through  You don't know everything I have been through                                             (What can I say. but You're faithful)                                                  You don't know everything                                                                                                     I have been through                                                                                              You don't know everything                                                                                               I have been through                                                                                            (What can I say, but You're faithful)
