[Verse 1]
I know what I saw
(Yeah)
I know who you are
(Yeah)
You can not go far
(Yeah)
I know what I saw
We both do

(Body cam)
(I got proof)
We know it's proof
(Boy you can't hide that truth you know)
No you can't hide that proof you know
Dude stop lying
(Ooh)

Life is like a jungle
Young and swinging rifles
Like the tyke was in the color guard
Am I right about it when I write about it
By the Bible, about the money, cars?
(Yeah)
On the records man he's swear he hard
But your favorite rapper got a body guard
(Ha!)
And shorty want them likes
(clack, clack, clack)
Going viral showing body parts

Ain't that the truth
Ain't that the stuff that we do
Don't we just fit in these shoes
Breaking the rules
Acting like we got no clues
So quick to make an excuse
Why do we use
One another like some fools
So quick to lust and seduce
Letâ€™s make a truce
Promise never to abuse
One another, then we do
We make the rules

Guess it's in our DNA huh
I'll be drinking with the K's huh
All the sudden [?] huh
Sunday hallelujah praise huh

Yeah I call it how I see
(See)
Boy I tell it how it is
(Yeah)
You can tell it [?]

[Verse 2]
I confess I was guilty
(Mm)
Matter of fact I was filthy
(Mm)
You can go check forensics
(Ooh)
Evidence stacked against me
(Sheesh)

But then he paid the bail
(Yo)
Now I'm fresh out of jail
(Aye)
Can't go back to that cell
(No way)
I ain't going back to that cell
(No)

Got a couple friends that relate (they do)
Got second chances like grace (like grace)
It's black and white like race (like race)
Put trust in God like faith (like faith)
He can take a man who's a ladies man
He can save a man make him brand new
Says you used to dance for them hundred bands
Was a man eater now she brand new
