[Intro]
I can't ignore it man
I can't ignore it man
No
Man
I don't wanna put away
I don't wanna put away
But I don't want to ruin my life

[Verse 1]
I'm trying to live my own theology
But I'm still confronted by my own hypocrisy
I've lost count of all the ways
I contradict the things I say in things I pray
And when I recite from my own Bible against my own Christ
Man I love Him to the core
But it's still a struggle trying to love Him even more
Yes I wanna finish well never bring shame
And never sprinkle dirt on the Son of God's name
I wanna stand firm I wanna end strong
But I be so afraid that I'm gonna end wrong
And provide for my self again and supply for my selfish sin
In spite of the knowledge You are a perfect friend
Lord hold me up I know You hear me praying saying

[Hook]
(You know I be getting it in with The Lord consistently
And I just fall off)
Don't wanna ruin, ruin, ruin
Ruin, ruin, ruin
Don't wanna ruin, ruin, ruin
I don't want to ruin my life

[Verse 2]
How is it that you can eat something
Be in love with the taste
Scrape crumbs off the plate, Let none go to waste
Keep eating it, and eating in it
Take a drink, eating in it
Bout a week later put none to your face
Exact same ingredients, numb to the taste
Is my tongue in the way?
Am I dumb? Am I fake?
Or am I just exhausted? Appetite lost it
Is my heart cold? Or is it just frosted?
How long is my crave is my hunger my thirst is
Having a relapse for idol god worship
I know this is dangerous, wrong, and deceit
But it's looking so sweet like bon-a-petit
I know God is my Father and I am His son
He provides for me I should not jump the gun
Said I know this is dangerous, wrong, and deceit
But it's looking so sweet like bon-a-petit
Voila
Then I have to tell myself
He was tempted to provide for Himself too
Dry desert no food forty days forty nights think His appetite
Wasn't like Eve's or the Israelites or like yours or like mine
Then the serpent came right time right lies
But He chose to be father not fed
Make the same choice resist the devil's bread

[Hook]
Don't wanna ruin, ruin, ruin
Ruin, ruin, ruin
Don't wanna ruin, ruin, ruin
I don't want to ruin my life
