[Intro:]
Warriors, come out to play
Warriors, come out to play

[Verse 1: Kur]
Everyday a nigga wake up
Gotta count my blessings, gotta grab a 7
Never put your trust in people, had to learn my lesson
They'll disappoint you
I know niggas' only fucking with me cuz I'm popping
They ain't really for me
Was never there when it was raining, there when it was cloudy
Came when it was sunny
Niggas' gotta bad batch, fucking up the block
Serving all the junkies
Sold anything for food, I was trying to get it
Nothing in my stomach
I done seen drug money get a nigga everything he ever wanted
I done seen rappers diss, catch them out in traffic
Bitching and they stutter
I done seen niggas' get a 1 to 2 and bitches go in a month
I done seen niggas' hungry, robbing niggas' without bullets in the gun
I done seen niggas' talk money, catch a case
Can't pay their bond
I done see niggas' flexing wit their fake rollies
Running out of time
I done see niggas' try to come at bitches
Cuz they thought the bitch was mine
I done had bitches tell me that they love me
Should of known them hoes was lying
Bitches don't give a fuck if you're on the bed
Laying there dying
If you trapping, moving hard, they don't give a fuck
You sell it and you try it
All they want is different bags from Chanel
The gonna leave if you don't buy it
Only with you when you got it, only love you when you popping

[Hook: Kur] (8x)
Trill niggas' do what they want
Bitch niggas' do what their told

[Verse 2: Kur]
Before the lights and all the cameras
Me and Dot was lighting candles
You could never understand us
Niggas' really left us stranded
Niggas' run up, I don't panic
Hollow tips, they come in handy
Niggas' wild'n on them zannies
Niggas' robbing their own family
Niggas' ball and never make the league
Every single day, I pray Felipe
Smile every time I see his daughter
Can't believe she really getting older
Nothing in the fridge but Baking Soda
I said "fuck it", had to take it over
I said "fuck it", had to fuck them over
I was trapping off a Motorola
Used to have dimes in my tube socks
I had my stash in a shoe box
Now I'm out L.A. with Young Chris
We in this motherfucking Blue drop
You know we high as a rooftop
We probably about to fuck 2 THOTS
I'm high as shit, smoking moon rocks
I'm eating grapes while I'm poolside
Bitches fucking for a Vegas trip
All these rappers niggas' making "diss"
All these rapping niggas' make me sick
Shit they rap about, ain't making sense
Pussy, I ain't never played the bench
They gonna take if you front the shit
You can have her, I don't want the bitch
Fuck them, flea them, yeah we run through shit
We was really in the Jungle with it
Middle room, about a hundred niggas'
(?) broke my nigga, sweating bullets
Pussy, I'll have you ducking bullets
Living my life to the fucking fullest
Come to the beef, it ain't nothing to it
Got a pistol, better fucking use it
You know I'm strapped in this fucking Uber
Shoot for myself nigga, fuck a shooter
Said that I can't and I fucking proved it
Said that I can't and I fucking proved it

[Hook: Kur] (8x)
Trill niggas' do what they want
Bitch niggas' do what their told
