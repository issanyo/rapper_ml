[Verse 1]
The first task of the interpreter is called exegesis
(Extra Jesus?) Naw I said exegesis man
It’s a Latin word, don’t be scared
Matter of fact I laughed when I first heard it too
It’s spelled e-x-e-g-e-s-i-s
Guarantee you learn this process and you’ll be blessed
Exegesis is the careful systematic
Study of scripture, for the Christian this should be a habit
But to discover the original intended meaning
Of the author to his audience is exegeting
But to do this man you need some tools
So let me recommend a couple of things you should use
Aight cool, first man you need this book
It’s called a commentary and it helps you to further look
Into some essential things you need to check
In order for you to properly interpret the text

[Hook]
With this skill this should keep you from heresy
And keep you from going through theological therapy
The words of God will change your life
If you keep the text in its context
With this skill this should keep you from heresy
And keep you from going through theological therapy
The words of God will change your life
If you keep the text in its context

[Verse 2]
You need some more books, I know it’s gettin’ scary
But you need some definitions, get a Bible dictionary
To go without these tools you can’t afford it
That’s why you need this book called a concordance
And every time you start to think this is too much to do
I recommend you reflect on 2 Timothy 2
And 15 and you will see what I mean
Simply because the serpent is lurking to glean those who don’t read
And those who don’t study to keep a lock on this treasure
From unlocking the pleasure ‘cause God’s words are lovely
That’s why we handle it as precious as pearls
To let our exegetical work reflect to the world
In accuracy, hoping that you happy to see
The very words God breathed handled accurately
Yeah, so many take text out of context
And come up with mess and more nonsense

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
What you don’t wanna do is called eisegesis
(I see Jesus?) Naw I said eisegesis man
You a silly dude, it’s Latin too
And that’s just the act of when you adding to
Or the process of reading one’s own meaning
Into the text and that’s just eisegeting
Don’t fret, I know these words are new
And phrases too, but it’s cool if you go back to school
It’s spelled e-i-s-e-g-e-s-i-s
Guarantee you learn this process and God’ll be vexed
A text can never mean what it never meant before
To its original readers or authors
So if you run into a difficult passage
And you know the Bible never contradicts itself
Then turn the pages to a parallel passage
And just let the Scriptures interpret itself

[Hook]
