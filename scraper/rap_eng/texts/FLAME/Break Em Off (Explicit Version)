[Intro]
Flame and Skarra on the same track?
Oh you know this is gon be crazy!

[Verse 1: Skarra Myakayaka]
My hoes is thick, my rhymes is sick
My game is slick, and my Ambiton is Rick
Break Em Off, Break Em Off real real bad
I step in the buliding and look how they react
Skarra Myakayaka I'm like the elephant in the room
I'm my Michael Jackson swag I'm tryna walk on the moon
Operation Doomsday I'm like a young MF DOOM
Always on the move like Mazda mudafucka zoom zoom
The streets is talking, the hood is watching
Them niggas is hating and them hoes is lovin
My rhymes stay fresh like they fresh out the oven
Catch me in the booth and I'm always shinin
I'm on fire motherfucker like the tip of a ganga
Leave you motherfuckin stunned like a Stone Cole Stunner
Like the tip of a gwai I'm too hot to handle
Touch me bitch and you'll get burned like a candle

[Hook: Skarra Myakayaka]
Break Em Off, Break Em Off, Break Em Off son (uh)
Break Em Off, Break Em Off, Break Em Off son (uh)
Break Em Off, Break Em Off, Break Em Off son (uh)
Break Em Off, Break Em Off, Break Em Off son (ayyyyy)

[Verse 2: Flame]
We Break Em Off inspiration from hunger
Spit thunder bolts with Skarra Myakayaka
Extra shine for the kick more game for your chick
Scoping like a model on a video flick
We mean business, haters ............
Few more stacks and the royalties billions
We expose dummies, put em in their place
More swag on the floor more thump on the bass
Looking at the clock the hours prime time
Too much blaze like desert sunshine
Foes keep sweating their palms are wet
My peeps keep smashing set your bets
Screw faulire I want success on my stats
Without that most bitches won't take off their pants
No question the real got the block on smash
I Break Em Off son with Mzansi Boy Swag

[Hook: Skarra Myakayaka]
Break Em Off, Break Em Off, Break Em Off son (uh)
Break Em Off, Break Em Off, Break Em Off son (uh)
Break Em Off, Break Em Off, Break Em Off son (uh)
Break Em Off, Break Em Off, Break Em Off son (ayyyyy)

[Interlude: Skarra Myakayaka]
Flame, talk yo shit nigga!

[Outro: Flame]
