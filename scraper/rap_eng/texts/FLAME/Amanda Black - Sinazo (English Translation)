[Chorus]
My heart
I wonder where you would've ended up, where you would've ended up, if you were still alive
I wonder where we would've ended up, I wonder where we would've ended up if you still were alive
I wonder where you would've ended up, where you would've ended up, if you were still alive
I wonder where we would've ended up, I wonder where we would've ended up if you still were alive

[Verse 1]
Would you be a dreamer
Would you be a realist
You left too soon,, I wouldn't know
I think you would be a dreamer
Would you be a victim
Would you be a fighter
Would you be a lover
Would you be a hater
I don't know â€“ they took you too soon

[Verse 2]
I think about you, every now and then
I miss you, I miss you like crazy
I can't help but think "if you were around would we be friends still"
If you were around would we be friends forever

[Bridge]
Would you be a dreamer (my heart)
Would you be a fighter
Would you be a lover (it breaks)
