[Intro]
God tells us that we need to be concered about justice
That's the reason the Apostle Paul is pleading his case all the way up to Seizure

[Verse 1]
Took a ride down Forrest Hill
Made a turn on How to pimp a butterfly
A lot of positivity coming through these rhymes
A lot of frustration with today's times
I can appreciate social commentary
A message conveying more than the monetary
It's good to put money on homies commissary
But it's something deeper that got his momma worried
Beautiful statements made about raising kids
Keep them from making the same mistakes we did
Teach them about taxes and how to manage money
Teach them about equity and investing money
How to deal with depression youngins be going through it
And the post traumatic stress from life in the hood
Searching for solution from everywhere under the sun
Looking for a brighter day but rejecting the son

[Hook]
And I know that the pain you feel is real
Yeah I feel it too
And we are sick and tired of this
We want justice
I know
We wonder will it ever end
I promise it will
But just know
You ain't gotta have it for time
You can have it for eternity

[Verse 2]
Lord knows we need good people changing policies
People in high positions seeking equality
Shifting legislation, meeting common needs
The kind of wisdom that strengthen a weak economy
And I can appreciate social activist
And some of the rappers giving analysis
And use their celebrity as a catalyst
As long if they recognize it's inadequate
To fix the problem bottom of all problems
To my philanthropic partners this might make you solemn
It's our sin nature affecting the macrocosm
We were born with it
Shaped in it we all got it
In the Garden we got it and didn't trust first
We disregarded our father so it's just a curse
So it's not that we don't value much of the Earth
We just want you to evaluate what's worse

[Hook]
And I know that the pain you feel is real
Yeah I feel it too
And we are sick and tired of this
We want justice
I know
We wonder will it ever end
I promise it will
But just know
You ain't gotta have it for time
You can have it for eternity

[Verse 3]
Seems like the goal is Utopia
So we striving for social justice and human rights
Just as sure as human trafficking should break our hearts
And cultivate in us motivation to go and fight
There are spiritual realities we must consider
Just as real with consequences we must consider
That education can't fix either
We must consider the person of Jesus spoken about in scripture
He told us about deep corruption in our hearts
And if we're honest see defiance in our own thoughts
See the evidence fail efforts of Karl Marx
Since the enlightenment been fighting to pull it off
To make this world a better place without God
But true hope and freedom only Jesus can provide
When your motivation is based on the one who died
Good works can count for eternity and present time

[Hook:]
And I know that the pain you feel is real
Yeah I feel it too
And we are sick and tired of this
We want justice
I know
We wonder will it ever end
I promise it will
But just know
You ain't gotta have it for time
You can have it for eternity

[Outro]
God tells us to care about the flourishing of the people around us; to care about our nation
