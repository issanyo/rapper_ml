Yeah. The Bible makes it real clear in Genesis Chapter 2 and Chapter 3 - that God created Adam, the first man, then out of Adam he made Eve. And God and man in a perfect relationship - no problems, no pain, no suffering, no beef, you know what I'm saying? But God told Adam not to eat from the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil, 'cause he said the day that Adam does that, he was surely gonna die. But the Serpent was the most cunning creature of them all, and he deceived Eve into eating from the fruit of that Tree, and then Eve gave to her husband Adam. And that's when sin entered into the world. And Adam represented all of us, all of humanity - past, present, and future - and we've fell short of God's standard of perfection. That's why we call it the Fall of Man, and that's why our world is fallen
