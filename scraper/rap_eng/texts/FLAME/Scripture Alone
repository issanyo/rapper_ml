[Verse 1: Flame]
I can hear your questions homie
Is that book reliable
Yes it is, the testaments are very verifiable
What do you believe in
What do you abide by
Maybe it's a mixture of different stuff
Tie dye
You boys are all syncretists
Synching in your own thoughts
The book that I hold to
Cohesive and never off
Say that my book carrying lies
But it's quite the contrary
Sixty-Six holy scripts
Its more like a library
Written by forty authors in three different languages
English is not one them
Greek and Hebrew surely is
Inspired and inerrant
Whoa what does that mean
It's from God and without error in absolutely everything
Yeah it addresses class in session
Boy I hope you learn somethin'
Heard them lies from other guys
Boy I hope turn from 'em
Why does matter though
If the Bible's false or true
Matter fact 'fore you answer that let me caution you
Don't play with epistemology
Homie we need absolutes
If there's no such thing as truth
He can do what he wanna do
She can do what she wanna do
And can't nobody say nothing
If a killer pull them choppers out feel like spraying something
Can't nobody say its wrong
And we all know that's a lie
Somebody outside of us has to speak and rectify
That's just what God did in the Christian holy book
Why don't you crack it open, sit down, take a look

[Spoken Bridge: Flame]
God is communicating with us man
The Bible is the most thoroughly documented work of all antiquity
If we can't trust in the Bible, than we can't trust nothing

[Verse 2: Flame]
Lets go
Why thy give my book a hard time
Especially the New Testament
Bitextual variance
That's utterly irrelevant
To the proper understanding and translation of the text
Yes with more manuscript there are more variants
But the more the merrier
Homie this is not a threat
This is strong evidence
We possess the original text
Have these manuscripts
Different areas
Different times
But they all testify to the same text
Just blows my mind
God is so
Ain't no words to explain
How he preserved his word through dessert plains and heavy rains
But they try to tell us that the Bible's been corrupted
I say they are misinformed and they might as well cut it
See Flame is bout to get deep
And I ain't talking scuba gear
I'm talking real scholarly
Bought to bring some proof in here
P75, Codex Vaticanus
These are two manuscripts from scriptures in the cannon
And When I say cannon I ain't talking about boom
But the collection of books that all function as the rule
Back to p75
It's from the second century
The other's from the fourth
Sorry for the history
One hundred and fifty years these copies are separated
But it's so fascinating how they are so closely related
But there is no team either
Controlling the transmission
Just God and his Holy Spirit
Looking out for his Christians
