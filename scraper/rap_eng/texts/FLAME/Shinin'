I keep His word in me
So I'm shinin all the time
Shinin all the time
Shinin all the time

Ay! Welcome! (From them hot boys)
I guess you wondering how we shine?
How we glow homie?
But non other than the word of God that keeps us shining

I keep His word in me
So I'm shinin all the time
Shinin all the time
Shinin all the time
I keep His word in me
So I'm shinin all the time
Shinin all the time
Shinin all the time
I keep His word in me
So I'm shinin all the time
Shinin all the time
Shinin all the time
I keep His word in me
So I'm shinin all the time
Shinin all the time
Shinin all the time

Partner life can be a struggle
It get rough sometimes
So I put my faith in scripture
Not the stuff that I buy
And when I try to take this Truth
From the scripture to masses
They say they can't hack this
And saying I'm judging like Mathis (man!)
I ain't got no problem with cats who say they wanna be happy
But the problem is your search is never ending like habits
Without God
Why do we settle for less?
Shiny rocks they say was rare
So we call it the best
And since your favorite rapper, rapper
Rocks it then you rock it
Losing you soul
Solely so they'll jock it
If there was a treasure that we said was better
And we told you where to find it
Would you follow or not even bother
And sadly, you'd settle for diamonds
But sadly several would settle
Never inquiring who the Messiah be
Neither the scripture that He was inspiring
Shunning the person that shining is requiring
Looking for pension but never retiring
Wanting to shine all of the time
Rocking the ice that you claiming is blinding
It's blinding you
Look at the irony

I keep His word in me
So I'm shinin all the time
Shinin all the time
Shinin all the time
I keep His word in me
So I'm shinin all the time
Shinin all the time
Shinin all the time

I keep, I keep His Word in me
It's like a light to my path
Mid amongst vipers we coming to light up the Ave
Whether you're in Rykas Island or you're right in my class
Adding up the sin price
I hope you're liking the math
Trust me dawg my wrist don't glitz with diamonds
So what is the means by which I'm shining?
Okay... you want to know the whole way?
Let me tell you what His word say
Lived the perfect life
Paid the purchase price
Gave up His life
Then he rose on the third day... okay
We born in this world into sin and
As soon as we step in it's really a problem
And what are we goin' do about this issue
And who is the one that can solve it
If sin is the cancer
And we need to answer
And we need to know what the cure is
The cure is the blood of Jesus
He's the one that can free us
He sure is
Yes... now that's the reason we gleam
The reason we rap, we sing, because Jesus is King
Yes... from internal to external like a hard drive
Cause I was saved like data the day the Lord died

I keep His word in me
So I'm shinin all the time
Shinin all the time
Shinin all the time
I keep His word in me
So I'm shinin all the time
Shinin all the time
Shinin all the time

I'm shinin all the time but you blind to the fact
Because your life is moving backwards like rewinding this track
Even if I'm wearing hand me downs with Calvin Klein on my slacks
Rocking the ice that I got from the swamp meat
That's got you downing me black
I'm still shining like a light baby
My mind is in the right places
The bible writes in this
My savior died in life that He might save us
So it don't matter
If your chain hang low
See when you die where will you go
Its gain the world and lose your soul

Man we gotta consider this life is nothing but a step to get to the King
Look at the people that's chasing the bling
All they pursuing is doing their thing
And what does that bring more of the pain
Sending you back into chasing the things
Only a cycle pick up the bible
Look and just see that it's simple and plain
Yea it's cool to rock them new shoes
Yea it's cool to rock them new jeans
Red monkeys Red Bapes
Don't make it replace the King
If what you buy what you drive
Stopping you from worshipping God
That's the problem
Get resolving
All of it dissolves in the fire

I keep His word in me
So I'm shinin all the time
Shinin all the time
Shinin all the time
I keep His word in me
So I'm shinin all the time
Shinin all the time
Shinin all the time
