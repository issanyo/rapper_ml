[Intro]
Hey Flame..
What's up wit it homie
A wise man once told me
Uh huh
That you're only as strong as your team
Man'

[Verse 1: Thi'sl]
Oh my Lord
That's my dawg
Over they bleedin'
He'd been shot
Leave my dirty
While he down
Forsake my dawg
I think not

Before I do that I'd rather lay down die here with my dirty first
That's somethin' I learned in the hood
I dint even learn that day in church
See my homie
Take a slug
Lay his life down for his block
Tired of seein' his homies die
So he stood and took they spot
And he would say (he would say)
'How we treat each other
I'm appalled
We sit back and straight applaud
Laughin' at each other fall
And say it's beef
This not beef
I sweat beef and lost my dawgs
Man I'm feelin' just like Paul
Glad ain't baptized none of y'all
We supposed to be one body
One body with different members
Remember 'fore you appoint the members
Dirty, we have all sinners
They supposed to know we hate it
Why love one another
How you s'posed to love your God when you can't even love your brother?
We pray for strength that we endure
Believe me we ain't turnin' back
But if my dirties trip and fall
That means I have to double back

[Hook]
One man down, (one down)
(We got) Two men down, (two down)
We got three men down
We got four men down
That's my dawg! (Double back and get 'em now, [that's my dawg though]
Double back and get 'em now, [that's my dawg though]
Double back and get 'em)
One man down, (one down)
(We got) Two men down, (two down)
We got three men down
We got four men down
That's my dawg! (Double back and get 'em now, [that's my dawg though]
Double back and get 'em now, [that's my dawg though]
Double back and get 'em)

[Verse 2: Flame]
Man it breaks my heart
When I see anotha brotha fall
When I see anotha sista fall
I think about the apostle Paul
Said, 'If anyone is talking sin
Spiritual men should go restore
In the Spirit of gentleness
Not kick a man while he on the floor
Keepin' watch
On yourself
Lest you too be tempted dawg
Burry one another's burdens
And fulfillin' Jesus' Law.'
That's the word in Galatians 6
We are in this relationship
Wit each otha
Sis and brotha
Listen fam
We've been equipped. (Man)
All of us are sinners, Ah
None of us deserve grace
But praise God
For the slain Lamb
Crucified in our place
Brutalized in our place
So I must go repair
If my brotha ridin' on a flat
Let me be da spare!!

[Hook]
One man down, (one down)
(We got) Two men down, (two down)
We got three men down
We got four men down
That's my dawg! (Double back and get 'em now, [that's my dawg though]
Double back and get 'em now, [that's my dawg though]
Double back and get 'em)
One man down, (one down)
(We got) Two men down, (two down)
We got three men down
We got four men down
That's my dawg! (Double back and get 'em now, [that's my dawg though]
Double back and get 'em now, [that's my dawg though]
Double back and get 'em)

[Verse 3: Flame]
Lookin' at this world we in
Lookin' at all the sin that's in it
What a miracle God has done for all the people that have repented
What a shame if one rejoices when he seein' his brotha slip
Rather than, reach out a hand, you stick a foot out so he trip
Man that's wrong
Don't you ever get convicted when you feel them feelings?
Rather than be a source in Satan's hands
Be a source of healin'
Matter fact, Matthew 18
Verse 15 then on down
Maps it out, how to deal with sin, in such a way to make God smile
Keep on prayin'
Askin' that the Spirit of God does a work
And if he brings repentance then we don't have to mention it to da church
And if he listens, praise God, the Bible says that we gained our brotha
They'll know we're His disciples
By our love for one another!!

[Hook]
One man down, (one down)
(We got) Two men down, (two down)
We got three men down
We got four men down
That's my dawg! (Double back and get 'em now, [that's my dawg though]
Double back and get 'em now, [that's my dawg though]
Double back and get 'em)
One man down, (one down)
(We got) Two men down, (two down)
We got three men down
We got four men down
That's my dawg! (Double back and get 'em now, [that's my dawg though]
Double back and get 'em now, [that's my dawg though]
Double back and get 'em)
