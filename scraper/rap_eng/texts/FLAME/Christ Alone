One day we'll be like You
There is no one like You
One day we'll be like You
There is no one like You
One day we'll be like You

Lord You're the only one who didn't sin only one who didn't bend
With temptation pressing in first Adam gave in
After that Abraham Noah did Moses did and many men before them
Yes even Israel after You split the Red Sea
After you rescued them from Egyptian tyranny
Many kings and many prophets many priest just couldn't stop it
Man is so sin prone yet can't atone for our own problems
Yet in the wilderness the tempted tried to get You to fall
Three times satan tried but got a word to resist them all
You overthrew the devil's power the demonic put to shame
Jesus is our high priest we've got peace cause he overcame
Yes through Christ alone (2x)
Anyone who's in the Son died to when they hung Him on
Overcame when He overcame resurrected when He rose
New creation new humanity our insanity was overthrown

Our Lord was tempted and tried
See the serpent with angel eyes
He saw the Christ in the wilderness
He salivated with anxious eyes
He came to Him with the same tricks
Turn this stone into bread it's been awhile since You've eaten
Has Your Father left You for dead?
Is this the place the Spirit led You?
And all this time He hasn't fed You
You're the messiah Son of God
Yet somehow He neglects You
He'll protect you
Throw yourself from the pinnacle of the temple
It's simple remember this is biblical

I came to tell you the devil lies
