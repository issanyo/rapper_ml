Well I was chillin' in the crib afterward reading my word
So I cut the T.V. on and I started to surf
At first I past a channel with a preacher man
So I said let me go back just to see what he sayin'
Reach to the left grabbed my Bible from the desk top
He started off well I'm like yeah that's hot
Hude was killin' it
I started feelin' it
Even though I didn't know what scripture he was dealin' with
So I said let me stay and see
Then he said turn to Isaiah 53
I'm like aww yeah man that text is raw
The very next thing he said made me drop my jaw
I was appalled
They offered him applause
And 20,000 people screamin' praise the Lord
Dawg I'm like naw
I'm laughin' it off but it was serious he was speakin' on behalf of God

It's time
Press stop and rewind
Go back roll back right now
With creeds and church history
Lets stop and see if we missed a beat

He was reading verse 5 by His stripes we are healed
Then he said cause of that we should never get ill
And if you do get sick its from a lack of faith
This false teaching is really exasperating
Then he said either that or some secret sin
So if your sickness comes back you need to seek Him again
Confess your hidden sin
And beseech Him again
And if you doubt your sickness will come creepin' again
So all that text was sayin' is that we shouldn't get sick man
Is that in the bible
That same preacher man said we suppose to be rich man
Is that in the bible
He said with my faith I can confess and posses it
Is that in the bible
Then he said God's people shouldn't suffer
Is that in the bible
NO

It's time
Press stop and rewind
Go back roll back right now
With creeds and church history
Lets stop and see if we missed a beat

So I cut the T.V. off tear drop fallen to the floor/
I was sad seeing these people fallen for it
I broke down then I started callin' to the Lord/
We can't afford to ignore this anymore
Furthermore if he would have just read verse 4
He would have understood the context a little more
For that matter
Should have read the whole chapter
To see the whole point that Isaiah was after
The whole chapter was about Jesus Christ
And specific details about Jesus' life
And healing in verse 5 was from our sin sickness
You know when the Holy Ghost quickens
I know what your feelin'
I know you offended
But when you repented the Spirit brought spiritual healing
But at the glorification
In the book of Revelation
Chapter 21:4 read the no mores
