[Pre-Chorus: Wes Writer]
Cause I know it's You and only You that give life
I fall down You pick me up every time (every single time)
My whole life I can tell you I don't mind
My whole life I can tell you I don't mind
Cause I know it's You and only You that give life
I fall down You pick me up every time
My whole life I can tell you I don't mind
My whole life I can tell you I don't mind
I don't even

[Verse 1: Flame]
I give You my life cause it ain't mine
Life throwing strikes on that pitcher's mound
I know we living on borrowed time
Let's go let's go
Trying to hit a homer every time
Yeah I'm running hard towards home base
Short stop on a double play
Back catcher hugging home plate
But I'ma slide umpire yell "safe!"
Call me that carpenter uh
My Lord was a carpenter uh
Clearing My heart back like an uh
Putting me back up to bat while I bunt
Nah I want a home run
Every now and then I strike out (strike!)
And I wanna be in them bleachers
Yeah man they look fun in them bleachers
Uh yeah ignoring them biblical teachers
Uh forgetting that I am a creature
Uh Forgetting that He is Creator
Uh and players they do need a Saviour
Hot potato hot potato hot potato
Back and forth when you making decisions
Cause consequences they go litty I'm saying
It's overrated when you been in them stands
It's underrated when you fit in His plan
Many survive many survive
Please understand please understand
Jesus turned a sinner man to a saint call it a grand slam
Fixin to grand slam

[Chorus: Wes Writer & Flame ]
It's You and only You that give that life
(You give that life) I fall down You pick me up
Every time (every single time) my whole life
I can tell you I don't mind my whole life I can tell you
I don't mind (I can tell you I don't mind) yeah cause
I know it's you and only you that give that life yeah yeah I fall down you pick me up every time (every time) my whole life
I can tell you I don't mind my whole life yeah yeah I can tell
You I don't mind I don't even I don't even mind

[Verse 2: Mike Real]
Yeah, yeah
I don't even, I don't even mind mind
I don't, I don't mind mind
Ain't no, ain't no rush rush
Take your, take your time time
Take my, take my rhymes rhymes
Take my, take my mind mind
I'm the, I'm the branch branch
You're the, You're the vine
And it should be You that's compelling them (compelling them)
But black people got what they telling them (telling them)
I never bought what they selling them (selling them)
There's way too much Christ in my melanin
There's way too much Christ in my melanin
They try to take out of my elements
They try to treat me like a dumbo
But they'll never fly like an elephant
They'll never fly like you're not straight
Sometimes I just get exhausted
Feels like I'm never on offense
But You not one for the nonsense
I know, I know it should be You
That we are chasing after yeah yeah yeah
But I favor rappers who He cater after
Hmm yeah yeah so all I'm trying to say, all I'm trying to say
What I'm talking about yeah I had a potty mouth
Til I took the old man out pow
Now I got a body count uh in the human eye
It's suicide but you and I it's beautify
To purify I crucified
My human side it's do or die

[Chorus: Wes Writer]
Cause I know it's You and only You
Who that give that life
I fall down You pick me up
Every time my whole life
I can tell you I don't mind
My whole life I can tell you
I don't yeah cause I know it's You
And only You that
Give that life yeah I fall down
You pick me up every time
My whole life I can tell you
I don't mind I can tell you
I don't mind I don't even I don't even
I don't even I don't
Mind I don't mind I don't mind I don't even
I don't even mind I don't even I don't even
I don't even mind mind mind mind mind
Mind mind mind mind
