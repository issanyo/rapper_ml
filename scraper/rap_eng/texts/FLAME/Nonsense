It's crazy how God makes us babies and then gives us souls
Then we enter into this world and sin it then takes control
And it molds us soon as Doc place us in mama's hands
Like patty cake, patty cake, baker's man
I remember as a young boy chillin' in the projects
So many crazy things I've seen I couldn't even process
When you see them dope boys you just think them dudes is cool
Selling work and skipping school, confused like a Rubix Cube
Something deep inside of you is captured by the nonsense
Club hoppin', pistol poppin', bodies droppin', violence
Ever noticed nobody ever taught you how to do wrong?
It's just the way that we're prone, we pick up wrong on our own
And I know I ain't alone, 'cause dirty we're all the same same
Mama and daddy, Adam and Eve is they name
And even though you and I may not be from the same city
I guarantee it's a fact: you have this in common with me like...

That's what you thought of as a young 'un doin' what they say is tight
In the schools gettin' in fights, in the hood stealin' bikes
Then they tell you that it's cool "Everybody's smokin' weed"
Sleeping 'round like merry-go, now they got you blowin' trees
Then you get a little older, they say "let's go hit the club"
Now you take a little drink, looking for a stronger drug
Then somebody come up pregnant, you ain't planned parenthood
Now you're sittin' thinkin' "should I hit a Planned Parenthood?"
Then you dive a little deeper in the culture and hear this
"You don't need to read that Bible, 'cause that God he don't exist"
"You don't need to trust in Jesus, because he was just a man"
"Please don't listen to them Christians, they have no clue what they're saying"
Now you say you hate religion, 'cause you just wanna be free
Say "I'ma do what makes me happy, and whatever pleases me"
"And whatever pleases me is exactly what I'ma do"
I was raptured, I was captured in that state of mind too, but I was...

But now I love the Father so much, I love Son so much
The Holy Spirit so much that I don't wanna turn away
So when the world tries to clutch, when my sin tries to clutch
When my flesh tries to clutch then I must turn away
I don't wanna break his heart with my lust and my pride
I don't wanna break his heart 'cause I trust in my God
And I count it all as loss just so I can know him
Paid and died for my sin so I can't live for them
And I can't live for you, and I can't live for me
See I'm hidden in Christ like playing hide-and-go-seek
I was dead in my sin, but God made me alive
Together with Christ Jesus, Ephesians 2 verse 5
I'm seated in heavenly places, by his grace I've been saved
I refuse to dig a ditch, go and lay back in my grave
I've been captured by his beauty, I pursue him super hard
Not no comfort, power, money, pleasure, and not a stupid car
I'm not...

(Yeah man. I know how it is bruh. We have been captured by sin
But now we need to be captured again by God's holiness man. Yeah...)
