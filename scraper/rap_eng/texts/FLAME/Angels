[Chorus: KB]
Got a lotta money, got a lotta clothes
Everybody know ya, everywhere you go
You be gettin’ praise all across the globe
But no, they ain’t got no angels praisin’ them, they not the man
They not the man, they not the man
But they ain’t got no angels praisin’ them, they not the man
Cats should get they minds right
Cats should get they minds right

[Verse 1: KB]
They say they goin’ in, rollin’ in, blowin’ stems
Hollerin' YOLO in a photo, Benz-O, ballin' colder than a frozen gem
And the girl he with, she a soda can, she’s a ten
Any given night he got four of them, you’re on top of the world cause you sold a mil'
But he don’t know about this other audience
This audience that's watching when nobody else is watching him
They don’t want yo autograph, unimpressed with accomplishments
One day they will return with the Son of Man to abolish sin
They know that the best men are still men at best
They see your anti-depressants cause you so rich but you can't rest
They've seen kings come and go, empires expire
Our pride to them must be insane, dirt swearin' as pure diamonds
But it must baffle them with dirt treated like pure diamonds
They never sin but we live in it and yet God gave us his pure finest
You wanna talk about amazing? Look, we’ll think you the greatest
When you get all creation together to sing your praises

[Chorus: KB]
Got a lotta money, got a lotta clothes
Everybody know ya, everywhere you go
You be gettin' praise all across the globe
But no, they ain't got no angels praisin' them, they not the man
They not the man, they not the man
But they ain't got no angels praisin' them, they not the man
They not the man, they not the man
But they ain't got no angels praisin' them, they not the man
They not the man, they not the man
Cats should get they minds right
Cats should get they minds right


[Verse 2: Flame]
The richest man in the world is worth 40 billion, that’s 40 billion more than me
The second man is worth 37, billion, yeah, go and see
That’s big money, that’s no sin, please don’t think that’s what I’m sayin’
But ain’t no demons shudderin' at them, they not the man
They ain’t never healed the sick, they ain’t never raised the dead
They ain’t fed five thousand with two fish and five loaves of bread
So why are y’all big-headed, puffed up, arrogant?
Why don’t y’all un-lead, gas up, burn?
It ain’t never been about ‘em, gotta put ‘em on the bottom
And they really got a problem and He put ‘em on the top
But you’re forgettin’ the bottom ‘cause you fallin’ like autumn
Yet you still tryna box ‘em, are you ever gonna stop?
Ayo KB, my prayer is that cats are made aware of His
Infinite preeminence, their images, it’s all His
They were made to reflect Him, represent and respect Him
With cars and clothes and cheap thrills we still choose to reject Him
He is Big, we are small, He's Creator, we're creation
He is God, we are man
Right response, fall on our faces

[Chorus: KB]
Got a lotta money, got a lotta clothes
Everybody know ya, everywhere you go
You be gettin' praise all across the globe
But no, they ain't got no angels praisin' them, they not the man
They not the man, they not the man
But they ain't got no angels praisin' them, they not the man
They not the man, they not the man
But they ain't got no angels praisin' them, they not the man
They not the man, they not the man
Cats should get they minds right
Cats should get they minds right
