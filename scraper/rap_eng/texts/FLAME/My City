(Acts 19-20) Let me tell you about my city little homie
That's if you ain't read where they practice black
Magic and speak to the dead
Minds fried like bleach to the head
From the stuff being preached by the Greeks if you read
Our main attraction is our main distraction/
Thanks for asking
Actually I can't stand her
Who is she she draws every man
And every woman from every land
To her temple of Diana
She's regarded as a sacred goddess
One of the 7 wonders of the world
It's obvious that Christlessness in my city to worship a many-breasted mummy-looking girl
Under the Romans my city is free so you can only imagine that's going on
That's why us believers here in Ephesus have no choice but cling to the throne

When we got the letter from Paul my dawg was locked in chains
This was the means by which the doctrine came
It was the teaching explaining the gospel main
From the Apostle Paul written to all the saints
In Ephesus (Eph. 1:1)
He started off wit some definitions explicitly written for Christians
He made it plain it wasn't a plan B
He predestined to a portion some of humanity
Through His own Son
For His own glory
Through His Son's blood
(Eph 1:3-6) said he was praying for us
That our eyes will see the hope of the call
The riches of glory His inheritance He has is us all (Eph. 1:16-19)
Said we are saved by grace through faith
Faith's a gift (Eph 2:8) so faith through grace
In light of that we shouldn't live like we used too
It's crucial that we don't do
What we used to do (Eph 2:10)

It blessed our hearts to read
How God revealed to Paul this mystery
How we were far from God with no peace (Eph 3:1-6)
We can't lie dawg we been foul
Cats might even know us as Gentiles
In other words we are not Jewish
We'd still be dead in our sin if God did not do this
Tear down the wall between Jews and Gentiles
Praise God now I can be His child (Eph 2:11-13)
Now we can walk in unity with no beef
And keep the unity of the Spirit and the bond of peace (Eph 4:1-3)
And share our gifts as we edify one another
No harsh jokin being corrupt lying on each other
Putting off the old man and putting on the new (Eph 4:17-32)
In our marriages (Eph 5:22-33)
Families (Eph 6:1-4)
Even on our jobs (Eph 6:5-9)
The new nature affectin every area of our lives/
The whole armor is applied cause we're soldiers for God (Eph 6:10-20)
