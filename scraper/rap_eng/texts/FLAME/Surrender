[Hook: V. Rose]
I'm never gonna run away, away from You
I open up my heart to You, I'm Yours
I'm pulling out my flag and I, I surrender
Anchor of my ship, You can hold me down
I'm never going to run, no, I'm never going to run

[Verse 1: Flame]
I'm never going to run, I am truly convinced
That Your ways are better, I'm not on the fence
Who distributes joy, who sets the soul free
Who can forgive sin, Jesus, who died for me
Yes it's true that I've been captured by Your love
I've been captured by Your grace, I've been covered by Your blood
I was lost but now I'm found, yes it's true You hold me
Jesus here's my white flag, I surrender right now

[Hook: V. Rose]
I'm never gonna run away, away from You
I open up my heart to You, I'm Yours
I'm pulling out my flag and I, I surrender
Anchor of my ship, You can hold me down
I'm never going to run, no, I'm never going to run

[Verse 2: Flame]
How can I run away, or go take a hiatus
When the decedent of David has proven He is the greatest
You see, He mediates, He is the mediator
Now I am so free, what a sweet savior

[Verse 3: V. Rose]
I found a real love and He is my ransom
Not going to escape, I'm going to stay
I'm captured yeah, but I'm so free
And I finally know that I'm where I'm supposed to be
So I raise my hands, I get on my knees
Because there is nothing like the day the Spirit captured me
And there is no one greater, I surrender I don't need another Savior
I'm never going to run

[Hook: Flame]
I'm never gonna run away, away from You
I open up my heart to You, I'm Yours
I'm pulling out my flag and I, I surrender
Anchor of my ship, You can hold me down
I'm never going to run, no, I'm never going to run

[Bridge: V. Rose]
My ship was a wreck, I couldn't pay the debt
And I lost all my treasure, so I hit the deck
When I saw Your banner I knew I'd never run and
I'm staying forever, I'm never going to run, no

[Hook: V. Rose]
I'm never gonna run away, away from You
I open up my heart to You, I'm Yours
I'm pulling out my flag and I, I surrender
Anchor of my ship, You can hold me down
I'm never going to run, no, I'm never going to run

[Outro: Flame]
Jesus here's my white flag, I surrender right now
