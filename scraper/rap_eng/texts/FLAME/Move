[Intro]
"Ah how you doin' sir
How you doin' ma'am?
Just want to talk to you for a minute
Can I do that?
Ah, excuse me sir, excuse me ma'am
Hello, how you doin', how you doin'?
Hello, how you doin', how you doin'?
Hello, how your peoples them doin'?
Hello
Yeah, Yeah, Let's go
Now to the left with it, now to the right with it
Now to the left with it, now to the right with it
Now to the left with it, now to the right with it
Now to the left with it, now to the right with it
Let's go

[Hook]
Now when the Lord tell me move I move
Anything He want me to yeah I do
But if ain't of the Lord then I won't move
It's because the Spirit lives
So I still show your love
When He tell me I move (15X)
(Talking about obedience (6x))

[Verse 1]
Man, I hate my disobedience always second guessing God
When he tell me share my faith
Now I gotta question that
Then I end up reasoning myself out of sayin' somethin'
Now the opportunity is gone cause I ran from it
Now I'm praying for his grace
That every time I would speak in the schools
In the mall, on the job, on the streets
This is how it's gotta be I'm talkin' about obedience
Fearing God, not man, that is the ingredients
Yes I know you can relate
Some of y'all are shackin' up
Time for you to move it out
Get your clothes, back it up
Yes, I know you can relate
Why are you standin' still?
When the Lord is called you to hit the foreign mission field
Yes I know it's hard though
Cause I understand it
But Jesus said "If you love Me then you'll keep My commandments"
Yes I know it's scary though
Cause I understand it. But Jesus said
"If you love Me then you'll keep My commandments"

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Hey whatcha lookin' at? Get from in front of that screen
That is so obscene, Jesus died for that very thing
Hey time for you to move, you need to go reconcile
You've been havin' beef with your fam for a while now
Go and confess your sin
Go to the LORD in prayer
Go (x10)
People everywhere
Be steppin' in the way that is called obedience
In this case it is good to be deviant
Deviate from the world
Run to Christ's Likeness
Run, I say run to the one who is Righteous
Get accountability go and read your Bible too
Get into the Word of God
And get the Word of God in you
Hey, here's an idea, why don't you go and forgive?
Why don't you go and repent?
Turn from you sin and then live
Yes, I know it's hard though
Cause I understand it
But Jesus said "If you love Me then you'll keep My commandments"

[Hook]
Now when the Lord tell me move I move
Anything He want me to yeah I do
But if ain't of the Lord then I won't move
It's because the Spirit lives
So I still show your love
When He tell me I move (15X)
(Talking about obedience (6x))



[Verse 3]
Do what you gotta do
Go ahead, get it on
Get a church membership
Stop church hopping, homes
This ain't legalism, fam
This is Christianity
Go ahead obey the Word
All else is vanity
You in that relationship, do you plan to marry her
Love her like Christ loves the church, 'til you bury her?
You in that relationship, do you plan to marry him?
Submit to him like you are the church or just worry him?
If you're not then back it up, flee the temptation
You can spend your singleness witnessing to the nations
You, don't you compromise?
Stand firm with it, though
Keep your eyes on the Christ, even if you're feeling low
Yes, I know it's hard though
Cause I understand it
But JESUS says "If you love Me then you'll keep My commandments"
Yes, I know it's scary though
Cause I understand it But JESUS says
"If you love Me then you'll keep My commandments"
