[Chorus: V. Rose & Flame]
Somebody please open the case
(Open the case!) we may need to investigate (woo)
Cause they never show it to your face (they never show it)
I can't tell who has been a fake I'm fed up
How many of us got a real friend
Somebody riding to the real end ooh fed up
How many others got a real friend so far (so call the fed up)
Keeping it up with keeping real

[Verse 1: Flame]
See most of the times
I'll be chilling every now and then
In my feelings cause people smile and look you in the eyes
And act like they got your best interest
I'm just trying to stay out the way though
Trying to keep my head down I'll be fed up straight up creative
Like all wow they lie they lie they lie
That ain't the same thing that you said to me
They lie they lie they lie now you gon' switch it up
When you in front of your peeps
Hard for me to believe all I did was show you grace
So hard for me to see your other face
To see you show your other face

[Chorus: V. Rose & Flame]
Somebody please open the case
(Open the case!) we may need to investigate (woo)
Cause they never show it to your face (they never show it)
I can't tell who has been a fake I'm fed up
How many of us got a Real friend
Somebody riding to the real end ooh fed up
How many others got a real friend so far (so call the fed up)
Keeping it up with keeping real

[Verse 2: V. Rose]
I must admit it took me by surprise
Oh some years ago when you looked me in the eye
Like oh you love me then I was caring through the fire
Like oh ain't that a shame but that's what's on the playground
Now we live our lives why you do that drive by
It's the it's the it's the it's the stuff we don't abide by
It's one thing for you to straight up promise swear that
But that faith love in my face you can have that

[Verse 3: Flame]
You don't really care though
You just a smooth talking liar a manipulator
You play the victim
I'm so tired of your silly games
Guess that's just the way you're  wired
I'm just shell shocked, wasn't expecting friendly fire
Oh you better thank God that I've practiced self control
Oh you better thank God I got screen shots to show
Open the case up now man I wish I wouldn't have recorded it
Open the case up now cause it is not the way you recorded it
Now I see you for who you are out there blue you left me scarred
Used me before but not no more used to be cool
Now here you are I'm done

[Chorus: V. Rose & Flame]
Somebody please open the case
(Open the case!) we may need to investigate (woo)
Cause they never show it to your face (they never show it)
I can't tell who has been a fake I'm fed up
How many of us got a Real friend
Somebody riding to the real end ooh fed up
How many others got a real friend so far (so call the fed up)
Keeping it up with keeping real

[Outro: Flame]
Your fake friends they out there
But we just take the high road
The high road
Them fake friends they out there
Feel better knowing God knows
Christ knows
Them fake friends they out there
But God knows
He's in control
Them fake friends they out there
Sometimes you gotta let em go
Let them go
Them fake friends they out there
But we just take the high road
The high road
