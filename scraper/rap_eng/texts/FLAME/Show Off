[Verse 2: Flame]
Break yo' self homie, yeah like the world do
Relax though im just trying to find your world view
My dude to be true, so I can hit you wit mine
Beautiful feet to help you see like a shoe shine
I got the world on my heart homie
All 7 continents
I move smooth with all Heaven's confidence
Book me a flight, rent me a car
Whatever I'll take feet
And meet you tomorrow
Right in your projects
Right in your village
With the power of God
And life in my Spirit
I gotta tell a Father about the Son that you sent
So they can come alive like they couldn't find my blueprint
Man its a nuisance simple distortion
Got me screaming out letters like Im on the wheel of fortune
But not any letters, the one's from the Apostles
Good news Good news I'm showing off the gospel

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Lecrae]
Like the moon, I reflect what the Son do
I dont wanna get the glory, I want the Son to (show off)
Never shun you, this might shock you
Draped in all black, though we share that gospel (show off)
And we ain't talking walking up to the Altar
We talking heart changed where your life gets altered (show off)
Hey im not a hustler notta notta hustler
Law abiding citizen, I'm a paying customer (show off)
Dont do this for the industry
Christ is my ministry
Preaching Christ Jesus to the workers of iniquity
Used to drink that Hennessey and God was my enemy
But now I'm reppin Jesus from Alaska down to Tennessee
Yeah, I spit bars but its not the sub-pars
Satisfaction like money, women, houses and big cars
I rep for a God who is really quite large
Soli deo gloria is one of my 5 charges (show off)

[Hook]
