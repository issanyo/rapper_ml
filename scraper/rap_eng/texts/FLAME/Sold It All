[Intro: Omelly]
I don't want hear this hustling shit you talking mane
You niggas a bunch of fraud ass niggas, know that

[Hook: Kur](x8)
I done sold it all, sold it all

[Verse 1: Omelly]
Nigga I done sold it all, from the soft to the hard
Phone flicker popping, sleeping in the cars
Snow about that, strapped down packs
My young nigga driving, I be in the back
Tinted to the max, I be breaking down the crack
We don't fuck with rats, nigga that's a fact
Niggas hating on me, I hope you pussies strapped
Fuck you and your army, I'll make your face kiss the mac
I be out here posted on the block me and my niggas on the strip it ain't shit we ain't sell
Got this raw got the hard got the weed by the pound only thing you got to bring is your scale
You got to watch how you move around most these niggas cause if the cops get involved they'll tell
I'm on the west coast doing me up on a tour line and he said he gon' send it through the mail

[Hook: Kur]

[Verse 2: Kur]
Where the fuck would I be without the coca
Everything I got came from the coca
Before I every wrote a rap in my notebook
I had stripes motherfucker like a [?]
Let me start off on a better note
When I turned my first eighth into a seven doe
Last week a nigga called me for a pound of reggie
Little did that nigga know I was rapper doe now you know
Praying that this shit get send off
And we don't take a big loss
My nigga Arab just came back from DC
Had twenty one pints in a [?]
I'm just trying to turn a Bonneville into a M-Sport
Grand coupe with the tint dark
My whole life I was trying to make the ends meet
But how the fuck the ends meet if the ends short
I used to have shit to sell but I ain't have no clientele
I was sitting on the work for like a week straight
I remember this time I was broke I was fucked up nigga would have did anything for a bean plate
Told my nigga I can't wait until we go on tour
So I can find a connect out in each state
Trying to go to the beach state
Trying to get them white squares like a wheat plate nigga

[Hook: Kur]
