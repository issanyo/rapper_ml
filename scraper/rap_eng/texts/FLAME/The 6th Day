[Hook: Chris Lee]
We were made to know You, meant to behold You
And praise Your holy name
In your image You made us, represent our creator
On the sixth day
We were made to know You, meant to behold You
Praise Your holy name
It's the reason we were made
What a good day

[Verse 1: Flame]
Whatchu livin' for, do you know who you are
Do you know you fell, can you tell by how far
Who told you your purpose, why do you exist
Why do you prefer doin' that over this
If you are a man, do you know your role
And if so, who taught it to you, told you to go
And to you baby girl, the question is the same
Do you know your role, are you in your lane
Man, I remember as a kid, watchin' everything they did
Tryin to learn who I is
How to dress, how to walk, how to talk a lot of shame
Made me wanna sell dope, made me wanna join a gang
Would've never understood that we, who are this way
The crown of creation invited to display
And represent the image of his face
Through certain attributes, the night of the sixth day
WOW!

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Flame]
Did you know God, in His independence
Is self-sufficient, He chose to make us in his image
And I ain't talking height, weight, facial features
I'm talking characteristics in common with his creatures
He didn't need us, he wasn't lonely
Trinitarian fellowship with his one and onlys
Do you know homie, what it really means
To be the devine image, family we human beings
See Genisis 1, verse 26 through 28 establishes who he is
Or who we are, or what we are
And where we were, and how far
Awaaay we gotten from a day in the garden
The climax of creation but ended up falling
Greater than birds and beasts but we ended up crawling
And now our viceroys are in need of a pardon

[Hook]
