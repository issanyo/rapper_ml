I know a place where we'll cry
But He'll wipe the tears from our eyes
All our fears will be alright
Because all in Him are alive
Oh and I
I know a place when you reach the end of the road
You can't carry the weight on your own
Jesus will lift the weight from your soul
Let go

Look at His accomplishments and perfect sacrifice
To appease God's wrath to worship Him is right
There is no other way they all lied
God sent the son and His son died
Put your idols to the fire let em burn
Christ resurrected and He will return
God wrote the story put Himself in it
Now you and Him can meet it's the way that He intended
So if you looking for a place that can take away the hurting
Looking for a place before your situation worsens
Looking for a place where the freedom is for certain
Looking for escape cause the enemy is lurking
Should you join another church and maybe you're sick and tired of searching
Cause it seems like nothing is working
I'm here to tell you that the place is in a person

I know a place where we'll cry
But He'll wipe the tears from our eyes
All our fears will be alright
Because all in Him are alive
Oh and I

Jesus, Son of God the Father confirmed at
His baptism I'm praying that you turn
You can have a brand new position in Christ forgiven
He is everything you need love, joy, hope, peace
Come rest in Him let go Amen

I know a place where we'll cry
But He'll wipe the tears from our eyes
All our fears will be alright
Because all in Him are alive
Oh and I
I know a place when you reach the end of the road
You can't carry the weight on your own
Jesus will lift the weight from your soul
Let go

I'm letting go
Letting go
Letting go
I'm letting go
I'm letting go
Letting go
Letting go
I'm letting go

He's on the throne
On the throne
On the throne
He's on the throne
He's on the throne
On the throne
On the throne
He's on the throne

Let go
