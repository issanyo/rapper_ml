[Intro]
Yeah yeah yeah
Oh yeah yeah yeah
Oh oh
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
Oh yeah yeah yeah

[Hook]
I know I might not show it every time but yeah I'm glad
That you forgave me I was low key savage in my past
I'm so thankful I'm so grateful you gave me another chance
So I'ma give my all until the day I breathe my last
Make me what I'm supposed to be dad
Give me what you want for me dad
Always looking out for me, Dad
How you sent your son for me dad Jesus
Man I love you dad

[Verse 1]
I'ma be honest
I think it's starting to make sense now
I spend too much time wondering why did you take this route
Why did you choose it?
Don't know how much longer I can hold it together
I'm keeping in mind though you only let it happen
To make me better
Pain turn to bitterness then you depend on the pain
When you trying to get closer to nobody
And I was like, "God, you to blame."
That's the way I felt but now since you've broken through
Bringing idols down
Please forgive me now

[Hook]
I know I might not show it every time but yeah I'm glad
That you forgave me I was low key savage in my past
I'm so thankful I'm so grateful that you gave me another chance
So I'ma give my all until the day I breathe my last
Make me what I'm supposed to be dad
Give me what you want for me dad
Always look out for me dad
How you sent your son for me dad Jesus
Man I love you dad

[Interlude]
Man dad, sometimes it feels like I worked so hard to save up all my money to buy my favorite ice cream cone, and right after I bought it somebody came up and smacked it right out of my hand

[Verse 2]
Yeah, sometimes you do bring the pain
Honestly feel like sometimes it's too much
Then we complain and we wanna give up
Making excuses to fulfill our lust
Now we looking at you we like what do we do?
Instead of us trusting you what do we do?
Then we run to our corner we drown in our sorrow
We pity tomorrow we running from you
We don't really like if we don't feel good
Because we got two different goals
We want convenience and happiness
He's too busy cleaning our souls
Getting us ready for home
Shaping and breaking he's making us holy
I'm learning my lesson on how not to complain
And how to be thankful because you do not owe me

[Hook]
I know I might not show it every time but yeah I'm glad
That you forgave me I was low key savage in my past
I'm so thankful I'm so grateful that you gave me another chance
So I'ma give my all until the day I breathe my last
Make me what I'm supposed to be dad
Give me what you want for me dad
Always look out for me dad
Always looking out for me
How you sent your son for me dad Jesus
Man I love you dad
I do I do
[Outro]
Yeah yeah yeah
Oh yeah yeah yeah
Oh oh
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
Oh yeah yeah yeah
