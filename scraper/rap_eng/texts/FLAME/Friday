[Intro: J. Carter & Flame]
It's J. Carter, yeah yeah
It's the weekend baby
Let's go

[Chorus: J. Carter]
It's Friday and the weekend on deck (weekend on deck)
Just might hit the town, you'll feel so fresh (feel so fresh)
[?] no I ain't gon' stress (no, no, no stress)
Cause he's been good to me I've gotta confess
Got me feelin' like oh, oh woah
Like oh, oh woah
Got me feelin' like oh, oh woah
Got me feelin' like oh, oh woah
Like oh, oh woah
Feel what you can't bless

[Verse 1: Flame]
Work week crazy (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Let it begin see the weekends
