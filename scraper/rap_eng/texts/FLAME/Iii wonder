[Verse 1: Papa J. Ruiz]

Look, (yeeee) you feel me
Look, look
It's form my cousin nay
And my boy big brother J
In the cell 8 by 8
I put my eyes were you eyes is
Rainy I drops in this pain
Seeking the kindness
The concrete world still bust
You with you allies
I'm feeling like life is
Rolling the dice and yet we pray to Christ we never met
And I hope my cousin never use again
Time is on circulation cut and put the eyes on
Remember you cookin at night
With your prints on the gun
Ziping the tongue
Eyes rolling in the back of your skull
Seeming a retard
And you just don't belive
Why the wall have fallen low
Body citizen tha just pray the god
Restrict you like an outcatst
On dre 3k but J
Love You like the brother but you can bounce back
On your 2 feet
This addiction you get out
Less can you get taken out fastin
This world dog
Forever we can leave dawng just pray I get to see my kids dog
But I dont know, but I dont know crazy shit dawng

Causse life's moving fast
In this hundred dollar cash
For this week won't last

Cause life's moving fast
And you just have to take a guess
About to do shit for my ass

Cause life's moving fast
Hundred dollar cash
For this week won't last

Couse life's moving fast
And you just have to take a guess
About to do shit for my ass

And I wonder
Is everybody going to the same shit as I
Feeling you wanna die
And I wonder
Is everybody going to the same shit as I
Praying to the sky
And I wonder
Is everybody going to the same shit as I
Rolling weed and getting high
And I wonder
Is everybody going to the same shit as I

[Verse 2:
I wonder if niggas are broke as me
Stomach growling in the couch got nothing to eat
And back got nowehre to sleep
Shallow nigga but my life's deep
Baby mama slave now I can't
See my kids
You don't have to be loocked up to be like you're doing your baby
Is the year to die is the year to leave
Is me against the world
Is feeling like a miss match
So funny games
Till a nigga pull his trigger
Back a swear to god
I just wanna focus
Tryna shake my negative toss of being hopeless
A young black poet
Was good about being the best if you don'tshow it
But I'm feeling yugly like
I ain't worthy
My own thought are the one that hurts mepsry one of this ? motherfuckers
Cosue don't murk ne
Stay away from women that dont deserve me
So gotta pray ?? ?? children
Child alone in the

[Verse 3: Vida Killz]
Such a beautiful gift
But we aren't
Go back to our peers
Create unity
Of fears
Many are thinking into this vises
To find a piece of silence
Cought between enliightment
Hopen your eyes to feel the vibe
Since the alchemy and geometry
Made upp with electricity
And the soul you see
All connected to our destiny
Like death like cycle
Rebirth and one birth
? ?? uknown
You're not alone
Conception of death so I can
Speak of
Prperly a leak
I take a kid of my life to my
Grandmom she takes the last days
Hope she felt it once
So I hope she'l fell it again
Neve have to wonder
Here and bright it out with this
Man
