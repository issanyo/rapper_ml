I don't want to ruin my life
When I see you homie it just looks like you gave in
I went to prayer start praying for my good friend
I took it there tears falling over your sin
And I ain't one to hurt you but I can't ignore it man
Guess you don't wanna trust the gospels so you caved in
And made excuses for your own sin
You ain't cutting off no limbs plucking no eyes or cutting no hands
When temptation starts popping like it's pay per view
You just stand there take a few to the face and you
Don't understand Satan's baiting you
And his whole plan is erasing you
You don't wanna be father you wanna be fed
Til you vomit up Satan's bread
You forgetting that you are son and that God is provider
I guess you jumped the gun again
