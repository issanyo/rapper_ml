[Hook]
You gon’ need the man that you sleepin’ on, sleepin’ on, sleepin’ on
Sleepin’ on, sleepin’ on, sleepin’ on, sleepin’ on
You gon’ need the man that you sleepin’ on, sleepin’ on, sleepin’ on
Sleepin’ on, sleepin’ on, sleepin’ on, sleepin’ on

[Verse 1]
See all they ‘bout is Bugatti talk, mix it up a little blasphemy
But as for me and my whole team, we liftin’ up who they blaspheme
So why they lookin’ at me sideways? Now a days everybody just on what they on
It can be popping mollies, talking illuminati, or pop a lot of bottles of Patrón
So why they lookin’ at me sideways? Now days everybody wanna talk about the killer
With a bad chick in the strip club with her; on that magic, bartender where the liquor get it gone
But they don’t recognize that we finna be gone, sleepin’ on him like memory foam
Was in sync but the symmetry gone, now sin in the track like kidney stones
So pardon me if I snap, pardon me if I rap
And put Jesus in it with the reason being I wanna see some men get back
But first, man gotta see he’s lost before he can even be found
Before he can even go up, a man gotta see you going down like this
They’ll see the need, please concede, ‘cause you can go out like Eazy-E
All for what? A bigger Bezel? Cash money, Lil’ Weezy Wee
That Wayne … I know you think you cool, you don’t even need Him
Boy you trippin’ … sleepin’

[Hook]
You gon’ need the man that you sleepin’ on, sleepin’ on, sleepin’ on
Sleepin’ on, sleepin’ on, sleepin’ on, sleepin’ on
You gon’ need the man that you sleepin’ on, sleepin’ on, sleepin’ on
Sleepin’ on, sleepin’ on, sleepin’ on, sleepin’ on
(Repeat)

[Verse 2]
We sleepin’ on him ‘cause we confortable, and we can’t tell that he angry with us
He loves us enough just to give us life, but now we done got real heinous with it
Now we done got real famous with it, legislate it and celebrate it
Advocating our favorite sins, hang ‘em up and we decorate it
I used to think it’s ‘cause we didn’t know, now I know it’s ‘cause we don’t care
I guess it’s like being on death row, it don’t get real till you in that chair
I said it’s hard to feel what you don’t think is real, hard to trust what you don’t understand
And now we talkin’ ‘bout the supernatural, and that ain’t natural to the common man
They sleepin’ on him like LeBron James ‘cause Michael Jordan got more rings
But it ain’t over ‘cause number 6 still playin’ and got more games
Only difference: God already won, so we playin’ the game in reverse
And the underrated is undisputed, and they think we stupid ‘cause we are the church
Hold up hold up, don’t get it twisted
We ain’t out of touch just ‘cause we Christian
It’s out of love that we even mention
Sin, repentance, forgiveness, the crucifixion and that you can be changed

[Hook]
You gon’ need the man that you sleepin’ on, sleepin’ on, sleepin’ on
Sleepin’ on, sleepin’ on, sleepin’ on, sleepin’ on
You gon’ need the man that you sleepin’ on, sleepin’ on, sleepin’ on
Sleepin’ on, sleepin’ on, sleepin’ on, sleepin’ on
(Repeat)
