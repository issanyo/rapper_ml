[Verse One]
This is a pop pill culture we willin' to try it
Anything from implantin' plastic to the Atkin's diet
We gone flap 'til we die like a fish from water
She's lost in her sin that's why you missin' your daughter
This ain't VH1 but here's a fabulous life
With them spikes in the whip picture them stabbin' the Christ
In a very vivid way I can imagine, the night
That's why I'm sparkin' the flames in the dark to flashin' the light
I must admit there are some ones that wanna be changed
But they're the ones callin' MTV so they can be made
But we're the ones callin' Jesus so they can be saved
Saved from what? Sins penalty, the wrath and the grave
We're so afraid to rep Christ we're so embarrassed
Jesus is God and He took many lashes
With a legion of angels could have beat the masses
So the least I can do is speak the truth in these glasses

[Chorus- X2]
News flash homie dawg I'm droppin' the dime
News flash homie I'm speakin' Jesus' mind
News flash homie I must mention the crime
I bring the bad news and the good news all at the same time

[Verse Two]
You can tell the size of a ship by the waves it leaves
Now who's name has been made into a figure of speech
Now who's death started over the beginning of time
A.C. actually in the beginning was God
And when it's all said and died in the ending is God
Since we sinners we need repentance we're defensive to God
Listen here's a sample but I'm not just blaze
We just blaze for Christ not just on stage
Walk with us Jesus but not Kanye's
The One that laid in the grave and raised in three days
Listen the term Christian dawg you might not like
But it's the definition that's in it and it is Christ like
So there it is we'd rather hear the cherubim's wings flap
Then some of these raps being rapped
Just like your rims still spin even after your car stops
Then where will you spend eternity after your heart stops

[Chorus- X2]
News flash homie dawg I'm droppin' the dime
News flash homie I'm speakin' Jesus' mind
News flash homie I must mention the crime
I bring the bad news and the good news all at the same time

[Verse Three]
These are God's words consider me doin' the ad libs
Tryin' to get behind your stomach just to see where your abs is
In other words tryin' to see who your dad is
It's the inner darkness in your heart like Knight like Gladys
Are you posted on them blocks like them St. Louis cabs is
Are you starin' at them rappers and you wishin' you had his
Cribs, and money and women and fashion
Did you see that Source cover and read it with sadness
Those same rappers that were drawn like magnets
To chasin' that stuff the same color as grass is
Might have to make that jailhouse they casket
And some will get out and continue to live backwards
But you want it cause it's so attractive
And ignore the One keepin' tabs on your track list
Dust to dust and ashes to ashes
I would ask for grace from Jesus' passion

[Chorus- X2]
News flash homie dawg I'm droppin' the dime
News flash homie I'm speakin' Jesus' mind
News flash homie I must mention the crime
I bring the bad news and the good news all at the same time
