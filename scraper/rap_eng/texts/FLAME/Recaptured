Man my heart is heavy, I feel a lot of pain
It’s been awhile now, since ya’ll done heard from Flame
But God has been rocking your boy
But at the same time, I see Satan’s plot to destroy
And I know I ain’t the only one
For God so loved the world that He gave His only Son
And Satan tried to knock Him too
But when they knocked the nails in His hands Colossians 2
And 15; but yet I still see a common theme
That’s plaguing adults, and it’s plaguing the teens
When Jesus died, He did more than just give us some help
So help me understand why we still living for self
We live for our families, For our money and cars
We live for our happiness, cause our pleasure is lord
But ain’t we seen yet, that that just doesn’t work
Living for self can only lead to dozens of hurts
Please hear my heart, like a stethoscope
We’re taking steps towards death, but looking for hope
Because we were captured by sin
We were seized, now we need to be captured again
(Uh) That’s why we need to pick them scriptures up
Start praying and fasting, And ask the Father to forgive us of
Forgive us for laziness, Forgive us Lord for our pride
Forgive us for worldliness, Forgive us cleanse us inside
Cleanse us Lord from telling lies, Cleanse us from our selfishness
Cleanse us from our fear of man; We need more than help from this
We confess our lack of love, We confess selfish ambition
We confess to You our lust, Oh Lord bring us to repentance...

See we were captured by sin
We were seized, Now we need to be captured again
And captured again. And captured again. And captured again. And captured again
