I thought I could trust you but dawg I'm disgusted
I thought you were innocent
'Til I read the 5th verse in the 6th chapter of Genesis
Since it's been nothin' but inconsistency in my life
I hate you I wish I can take you and break you tonight
Because I'm tired of your suggestions
I'm tired of all your reflections
I'm tired of you sayin' sex is the best way to ease pain
Insinuating I should sin in a situation you similar to Satan ever since Eve came
And Adam sinned now within I enter a battlefield
Injured filled up with sin and I'm bound to bust like a bladder will
Why do you torture me
Often caught up in forgery
Signing my name on sins that I knew I shouldn't have committed
Feel like I'm losin' I'm choosin' all of the foolishness
Disturbing my peace like you ludicrous
Feel like forget it
But I'm a fight you because I really don't really like you
Invite you? I'll never trust you again

I'll never trust you again
And if I ever trust you again just know its just the lust that's within
It's just the wrestle within
But when He comes to rescue His men
You'll never ever sucker me in
No never ever again
My greatest enemy pretends to be friends
But it's the inner me that needs to be cleansed
Since we've seen the second person with in the Trinity win
Marked the day of my enemies end
I'll never trust you again

Chill with the sob story and give God glory
I'm feelin' your conviction but what you spittin' is really fiction
Inaccurate depiction not based on holy inscription
So listen to my diction to get my proper description
Imagine a cave and there your mind, emotion, and desire
After your saved is where you'll find devotion to Messiah
Conflicted desires collided inside its divided
But God can unite it provided you desire to fight it
You actin' all surprised you got a wretchedly mind
Like you ain't read Jeremiah 17:9
We both know what Adam did to us in the garden B
Your still suppose to love the Lord your God with all of me
I'm called a heart but see I'm not a bodily artery
Pardon me but honestly you were improperly guarding me
Cause whether it's the T.V. or CD
Or DVD easily I'd speedily greedily eat what you feedin' me
If you ain't buildin' me up you knockin' me down
Which makes your deeds come from a heart of darkness like apocalypse now
The best advice I can give you is learn about mortification
The Lord is so patient He'll bring you to glorification
You ought to respect the grace the architect the plan
If water reflects the face the heart reflects the man
So to sum it up the point I'm comin' to Flame
Not trustin' me is not trustin' you because we're one in the same

Yeah, yeah I know we one in the same
And I know that I'm wrong for shiftin' the blame
But what I'm sayin' is if you tell me to sin/ never again will I trust you again

I'll never trust you again
And if I ever trust you again just know its just the lust that's within
It's just the wrestle within
But when He comes to rescue His men
You'll never ever sucker me in
No never ever again
My greatest enemy pretends to be friends
But it's the inner me that needs to be cleansed
Since we've seen the second person with in the Trinity win
Marked the day of my enemies end
I'll never trust you again
