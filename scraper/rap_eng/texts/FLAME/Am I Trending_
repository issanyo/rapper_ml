[Verse 1: V. Rose]
Should I? Should I?
Should I? Should I drink it up?
Should I, should I pour my life into a cup?
Would that make me, would that make me down enough?
Am I trending?
Am I, am I trending?
Should I? Should I?
Should I show off what I got?
Just so they can, just so they can say I'm hot?
Does he love me?
Does he love me, love me not?
Am I trending? Am I am I trending?

[Chorus: V. Rose]
But oh! You just wanna be the hot topic the hot topic
But oh nah nah nah, what like you gonna do to stay toppin', stay popular
You are, so obsessive like am I am I am I trending?
I know you have heard this before, but choose it now who do you love more?
You think you serving God but you not if he ain't that number one in that spot
It's all bad, but there is a chance to change all that
Cuz I know that you ain't all bad, you just think people like that so you act like that

[Verse 2: V. Rose]
Should I? Should I? Should I go bad?
Should I? Should I forget my manners where they at?
Shouldn't I do these things just to keep up with the fad?
Am I trending? Am I am I trending?
Should I? Should I do it because they told me to?
Should I should I jump off the bridge right after you?
Don't care if I hurt myself as long they thing that I am cool

[Chorus: V. Rose]
Am I trending? Am I am I trending?
Care what you think? Care what you think?
Am I trending? Am I am I trending?

[Verse 3: Flame]
Got that 100 self. Can't be that help. Am I the trending topic? Somebody help me!
Might need some therapy, need that flu. I need my fix, I need my view
So lets say, trying to say that it don't take faith, then they replace grace, now you obey and do what they say. Do it your way, find out you wrong. Do what you want, find out you wrong. He can save you though. Don't matter what you on

[Chorus: V. Rose]
But oh! You just wanna be the hot topic the hot topic
But oh nah nah nah, what like you gonna do to stay toppin', stay popular'
You are, so obsessive like am I am I am I trending?
I know you have heard this before, but choose it now who do you love more?
You think you serving God but you not if he ain't that number one in that spot
It's all bad, but there is a chance to change all that
Cuz I know that you ain't all bad, you just think people like that so you act like that

[Bridge: V. Rose]
Am I trending? Am I am I trending?

[Outro]
You murdered this V!
