Battery (Feat. Flame)

On my knees making a plea
Lord I'm ready use me
The people in the world need a way
I'll tell them what you'll have me to say
And I'll keep my hands in the air

Pre-Chorus
Jesus Your name is power
You're the outlet I plug into
I just want to be used
I want to be electricity just for Your city

Chorus
I feel His energy
Charging me
Like a battery
Every time my hands go up up
Up up every time my hands go up up
Up up
Oh oh oh oh Oh oh oh oh Oh oh oh oh oh x2

Rap verse (Flame)
Uh where are them hands at
Get them up high where them hands at
If you know Jesus stood
In your place giving you grace then don't take it for granted (no)
See I cannot be purged
When I'm feeling the surge
And I'm feeling the urge
To give them the Word
Yes I gotta rejoice cause with my voice
I was screaming at chicks
Rapping bout nothing and trying to get rich
Looking at heaven and sharing my fist (but uh)
I want the Lord to use me like I'm a tool like I'm Moses' rod
Screaming give me Jesus
Give me Jesus
Give me Jesus
Give me God

Bridge
Can you feel the power
When you say the name
Like turning a light on
And all the darkness fades
But we don't deserve it
It's only by grace
It's only through faith
That He uses me
