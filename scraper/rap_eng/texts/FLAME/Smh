[Intro: Spec]
We all grew up needing paper like a public school
They told us Benjamin could save us, U.S. revolution
Did the math, making music was our best solution
Then You saved me, Lord I pray You save my homies too

[Hook: Spec]
Tryna get 'em 'for that bang bang
When someone run up wit that thang man
Say they ain't afraid of man mayne
But hell and jail it ain't the same thang
Smh, smh, smh, smh
(Lord please save my homies
Lord I pray You save 'em all)
Smh, smh, smh, smh
(Lord please save my homies
Lord I pray You save 'em all)

[Verse 1: Spec]
She do anything for that Michael Kors
And he a stick up kid for them retro Jordans
But what he really doing wit his life tho
Run around from the light tho
But he ain't have no daddy to teach him the bible
I trust in You Lord, I just pray for they mind for 'em
If life told me double back and get him
I would double back and get him if I could
But they ain't livin', I can't raise 'em from the dead
Only speak up in 'em and tell 'em about the winner
But you gotta come and get Him
I tell you hold on a minute
You gotta come and get 'em Lord
I pray that's Your will for my family
These is my homies I pray that can stand wit me

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Flame]
Say he in love wit the coco
Say he got it for the low low
But I'm a tell you boy what you really got (hope)
Tell you boy what you really not (dope)
Tell you boy what you really stop
He don't really know that he really can change
He don't really know God really has a plan
To come and save man take the gun out his hand
Take the grams out his hand, you are not a caveman
He don't really know that he really can live
Take care of his kids and go to the job
You ain't gotta rob, you ain't gotta slide
You can still look suave, you can still love God

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Spec]
Lord I'm prayin' for #SMH in addition
If you want your homies walkin' through the gate wit ya
You so helpless, you ain't gotta know heaven
Say he ain't got no leverage, raise my Dad up
He raise my Dad up, all I can do is just tell 'em you better
Errbody say I died and gone to heaven
Don't nobody ever say I died and switched in wit the devil
Don't nobody want that everybody wanna make excuses tho
Don't wanna take the L but do anything for the Louis
Don't live in your favorite movie tho rappin' like you invisible
Really I know you miserable, really you need a superhero
We can do it no game, Save My Homies, SMH
