[Verse 1]
God eternally exists
As being three in His personages
Father, Son, and Holy Spirit and each person is
Fully God and there is only one God who subsists
So chew on this
Cause this is meat and I'm certain of this
His prerogative could have been to conceal Himself
But we serve a God who has chose to reveal Himself
To be certain of who we servin' let's search the text
Because it's urgent that we worship Him for who He is
The topic of the Trinity should evoke some emotion
For those who are chosen
And also for those who oppose it
Examine close He's distinctive in His entities
That's why we contend for the Trinity in serenity
We have no Christianity if God is not triune
In that case we are were saved by whom
Then creation was made by whom
Then redemption was made by whom
The consummation will take place by whom

[Hook]
Pastor Joe speaking
T-R-I-N-I-T-Y
It's the trinity
It's the trinity
Oh blessed trinity

[Verse 2]
If we could peer in the past and see a system called dynamic monarchianism
Another system modalistic monarchianism
Before the session we gone focus on one of the isms
(Which one is that?) Modalistic monarchianism
Get to the core or the center where the belly is
Popularized by a guy named Sabellius
Trying to fight for the position of monotheism
Traditionally held by Jewish in they religion
And that's true but he started trippin' in his position
And said that God manifested Himself in different
Modes at different times this is real twisted
That's why a bishop named Athanasisus had resided
In a meeting in Nicea in 325
A.D. where they debated was Jesus God
And if He was, was He the Father the first time
Jesus the second
And Holy Spirit the third time
While affirmed that the Father is God
That the Son is God
And the Holy Spirit is God
Good that ain't gone solve it
Cause the problem is this
It's the simultaneousness
That he denied

[Verse 3]
Modalism is back and its now packaged as Oneness Pentecostalism
And its growing in numbers now like the cost of living
And when they hear this I'll be labeled a Pharisee
But the Assemblies of God already labeled it heresy
In the 20th century when it first emerged
And ever since its birth its been hurting the church
In conclusion a myriad of questions I ask
Cause its confusing and steering away at the masses
I pose to you question number 1
You mean to tell me that the Father is the Son
Well who was He praying to in the garden of Gethsemane
I guess you'll say He was prayin' to His deity
So you sayin' that His human side
Is prayin' to His divine side
That is Father
In that case then there are two beings
In the person of Christ is that what you are seeing
No that's not the scriptures that's confusion
And it takes stabs at the hypostatic union
And that's that the one Jesus
Is 100% man and 100% God
Not 100% Father and 100% Son
