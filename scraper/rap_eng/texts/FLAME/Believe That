[Intro: Flame]
Look around they ain't talking bout God in yo city
We gotta reach em
Is any-body here wit me
Does anybody here believe it? I do
Does anybody here believe it? I do
Does anybody here believe it? Do you
Does anybody here believe it? Turn up
I believe I believe it
I believe I believe it
I believe I believe it

[Verse 1: Flame]
You say the people need something different
I'm like yeah what you gon give 'em
You say he got a message for the people
Go to college and treat everybody equal
You should get a job
You ain't gotta rob
Stay pure save yourself till your wedding day
He don't put a ring on it then don't let him play
That's incomplete,That is not all people need
That does not make you unique, The state of his soul should be making you weep
Our message is more than a challenge, It's more than we're morally damaged
You should turn from your sins cause He's coming again and eternity hangs in the balance

[Hook: Flame]
Does anybody here believe it? I do
Does anybody here believe it? I do
Does anybody here believe it? Do you
Does anybody here believe it? Turn up
I believe I believe it
I believe I believe it
I believe I believe it
I believe I believe it
Does anybody here believe it? I do
I believe I believe it
I believe I believe it
I believe I believe it
I believe I believe it
Does anybody here believe it? I do

Look around they ain't talking bout God in yo city
We gotta reach em
Is any-body here wit me
Does anybody here believe it? I do
Does anybody here believe it? I do
Does anybody here believe it? Do you

[Verse 2: Flame]
He say he got a message for the people
Go and get it but you gotta get it legal
You can whip but don't be messin' with the baking soda
Take care them kids set em up so when they get older
They don't live a life of crime
Blowing money blowing pine
All them good things without Jesus in it
Ain't gon' help in the end if man ain't repented
That's incomplete,That is not all people need
That does not make you unique, The state of his soul should be making you weep
Our message is more than a challenge, It's more than we're morally damaged
You should turn from your sins cause He's coming again and eternity hangs in the balance

[Hook: Flame]
