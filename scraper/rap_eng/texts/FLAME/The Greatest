[Intro: Flame]
He the greatest
I mean really the greatest
Nobody compares to Him
That's why I love Him

[Verse 1: Flame]
So many flavors come and taste it
Get wasted faded overrated
But then they say my God is dated
My generation is so jaded
In sinking sand don't place your hope
Put trust in man a slippery slope
Cause all that stuff will bring you down
That's why we stay looking up
Cause you stay true, you all real you graceful
We thank you for faithful love
That you lavished on us
We been fans of all the things you paid for for us
Man whats the latest? God is still the greatest

[Verse 2: Flame]
Don't place hope in this world system
Classism racism ain't that much different
Don't place all hope in politicians
Cause they can make a promise then go outta commission
You making plans you making friends
Then you find out later they ain't really your friends
Cause all these people can let you down
And you know it's true you thought it was permanent now they act like they don't notice you
But when people determine to turn on you with no concern for you like you disposable
You get emotional this world can be brutal might even blackball you then misconstrue you
Twisting the truth make me do something to you
That's why we stay looking up
Cause you stay true you all real you graceful
Thank you for faithful love
That you lavished on us
And we're fans of all the things you paid for for us
What's the latest? God is still the greatest

[Verse 3: Flame]
I might sound like a broken record
But ain't nobody broke His record
Forever faithful never reckless
I know
I might sound like a broken record
But ain't nobody broke His record
Forever faithful never reckless
I know
