[Intro: Dr.Russell Moore]
As American culture is secularizing
We have an opportunity for this to become much easier for us
The church is being disestablished from the rest of the community
It's already happened in some parts of the country
It's happening now

[Hook: Flame]
The world is crazy
It's all a sign of the times
They think we crazy
They say we're out of our minds

[Verse 1: Flame]
There's something we're facing. I'm hoping you notice
And we can't escape it, it's everywhere, everytime, man, that I look over shoulders
Some people are searching, they hurting, their looking for purpose but not in religion
They say it don't work. In particular, Christians are using the church as a business
They tired of the silence. They're turning to violence
Some people just don't wanna talk no more
The culture has shifted since Ferguson, Eric Garner in New York and then Baltimore
Look at Chicago with Drill music. Youngins they gunnin' and dying by the minute
Shout out to churches that deep in the trenches, being a witness and making a difference
Let's switch for  minute. Remember the case with Governor Pence in Indiana
They challenged religious liberty, ventually putting our faith in the slammer
The LGBT community collectively said it was said it was discrimination
Over their sexual orientation
We can't afford to ignore what we facing

[Hook: Flame]
The world is crazy
It's all a sign of the times
They think we crazy
They say we're out of our minds
5150, 51/50 The worlds going 51/50
Can I get a witness deep in the trenches
5150, 51/50 The worlds going 51/50
Can I get a witness deep in the trenches

[Verse 2: Flame]
They're applying the pressure but keep in perspective
That we do not wrestle with people but demons are scheming to reject the message
The Kingdom of Heaven progresses, so Satan's regime it extremely feels threatened
But for God and His wisdom to put us in this position we should think it's a blessing
We're tired of the statement that "this is a Christian nation" Finally, that cultural wall will fall
And the Gospel will flourish, authentic conversion all as a result of the culture war
That's why we connect with the people and help restrain evil through policy shifting
Christians who get it it's socially driven, all cause we know it's a holistic mission
Now lets switch for a minute. We gotta consider that this is a post-Christian nation
Or a pre-Christian nation. The point is to say that the people don't know where we stand
So we just can't be positive. Gotta give Gospel reasons we believe in the faith
The biblical way that our conscience is shaped with a kindness that backs up our articulation

[Hook: Flame]
The world is crazy
It's all a sign of the times
They think we crazy
They say we're out of our minds
51/50, 51/50 The worlds going 51/50
Can I get a witness deep in the trenches
51/50, 51/50 The worlds going 51/50
Can I get a witness deep in the trenches


[Outro: Dr. Russel Moore]
We have the opportunity, as the culture secularizes around us and as the church becomes increasingly strange, to question ongoingly, "How are we not reflecting the Kingdom on God within our church structures?" and then for our church structures to form the sort of consciouses that are able to speak outside about questions of the common good and public justice in a way that doesn't lead us inward, and it doesn't lead us outward, but it leads us forward
That gives us the opportunity to maintain distinctiveness and engagement at the same time
