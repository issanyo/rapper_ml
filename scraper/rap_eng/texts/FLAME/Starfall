VERSE 1
(Singing) G
Look at the sky
The stars fallin’
Imposters stealing other’s pride
They think beauty is better than talent

(Background) Flame
They want
Money
Money
Money
Money

Greed
Greed
Greed
Greed


(Keyboard kicks in)

(Main Tune) G
Starfall…
Looking around me…
Starfall…
Showering around me…

(Rapping) Devil
It's not the money, it's not the greed, it's the want, not the need, its the talent, not the greed...
All we need is is love, life, lets stampede in the music industry for life, for love, For music
(Main Tune) Galbraithe
Starfall…
Looking around me…
Starfall…
Showering around me…

VERSE 2

(Guitar kicks in hot)
(Singing) G and Flame
Look at the sky
Not the way it’s supposed to be
I see sta-a-a-rfall
Burnin’ up like fi-i-ire

(Rapping)
Yo
It's not the money, it's not the greed, it's the want, not the need, its the talent, not the greed...
All we need is is love, life, lets stampede in the music industry for life, for love, For music
For industry apart
Everytime we sing
We rap
We form a rap that makes the stars rise
We form an enterprise

(Towards the final two reprise raps) G and Flame
Burnin’ up, burnin’ up, burnin’ up
Comin ‘ up to dat fire
Burnin’ up, burnin’ up, burnin’ up
Comin ‘ up to dat fire

(Keeps Going) Everyone
Burning up, Burning up, Burning up
Comin’ up to dat fire
