And some people just flat out never accepted Christ. That's OK, 'cause through God's grace, he put together something like this for you to hear the Gospel tonight. Through Christian hip-hop, he rigged it together where you can come out, hear some bangin' beats, hear cats spittin' on top of them, but hear the message of the Cross all throughout the songs and after the show. Anybody in this room that's sayin', "Look, I've never heard the Gospel of Jesus Christ," or "I've heard it and I never really understood that my responsibility was to respond empty-handed 'cause God created me, and to repent is a command" - it's not an option. It's not one choice among a whole bunch. It's a command to repent, 'cause God created you. Jesus Christ made you, he owns you. The responsibility is for you to surrender, to lift up your hands and say out empty-handed, "I have nothing to offer, my righteousness is that of a filthy rag, I recognize that there's a separation in the relationship 'cause I've offended God, now he has a problem with me, now I recognize that I need to be back in right relationship with the God that made me." If it's anybody in the room that that's the expression of your heart right now ... you feel God the Holy Spirit tugging at your heart right now like, "Oh, that's me" ... As I look through life I just see myself loving to do what I love to do, but I recognize that the end of that road is destruction!
