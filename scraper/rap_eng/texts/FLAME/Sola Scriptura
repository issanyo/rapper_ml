Lately man its been some problems the scriptures have been under attack and that's crazy
See God's word is the final authority I'm sorry there's no way you can sway can't persuade me
The holy scriptures is the only sufficient certain and infallible rule for the Christian
Nothing can be added at all so you can keep your revelation and religious traditions
The-op-nyoo-stos (theopneustus) its God breathed
2 Timothy 3:16
Because the scriptures are the only example of God breathed revelation in possession of the church
They form the only infallible rule of faith for and which we base the church
Let's talk about inspiration
God's the author no mistaken man

People pick pick and choose
What they will and won't use from the holy scriptures

All of scripture

So if you LDS Jehovah's Witness or if you Roman Catholic

The scriptures are perfect and they are able to guide the people of God into the truth God
