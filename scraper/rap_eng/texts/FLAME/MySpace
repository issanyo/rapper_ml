Young Chante Andrea Jones
Never met her father and momma's never home
Plus she's 15 and she lies about her age
She always on the phone or her myspace page
She likes to socialize cause it makes her feel loved
Mom doesn't have time for something simple as a hug
Drugs got her mom strung out
All on the streets
Suicide attempts as tears drip down her cheeks
This is deep
She's so young, with so much pain
There's so many things Chante wishes she could change
So what she does is spends hours of the day
Meeting new friends in her own little place
Yesterday she counted and had 300 friends
Most of them young, but yet some were older men
But it's okay, Chante says that it's safe
Her own little place to get away
Her myspace

Just wanna know that I am loved and that I am really beautiful
Everything around me tells me to be more than me
I just want to get away
Just wanna know that where I stand someone will accept me for who I am
Just understand maybe I can find a place
Where it's okay

Chante's profile is not marked private
Just by her pics you can see why the guys click
Yea, she's cute and she's not trying to hide it
It's best for me to not even try to describe it
Plus she's young, but you can't tell by how she's dressed
The messages she gets seems to express
Or at least suggest that he's interested in meeting
So she accepts, thinks he's cute, now she's cheesin'
Every click she mistakes it for love
Her daddy is gone plus she's too young for the clubs
Her about me section seems to suggest
That's she's sexual or open to sex
As time progress they make plans for a date
Chante lied to this guy 'bout her age
But it's okay
Chante says that it's safe
Her own little place to get away
Her myspace

Just wanna know that I am loved and that I am really beautiful
Everything around me tells me to be more than me
I just want to get away
Just wanna know that where I stand someone will accept me for who I am
Just understand maybe I can find a place
Where it's okay

Young Chante Andrea Jones
Never met her father and momma's always gone
Feeling all along invited him to her home
She's feeling it's wrong
But she figures her feelings wrong
All arrows point to the fact that it's love
Is what she thinks before she offers him a hug
A couple of chats man this cat's still a stranger
But young Chante can't foresee the danger
But she didn't know she was messing with an adult
She messaged a cat wanted for sexual assault
A sexual predator who preys on the young in age
Like Chante who was fearfully and wonderfully made
She ain't know Jesus Christ gives forgiveness and grace
Searching for love only ended up getting raped
Her life was shattered
If only she'd played it safe
And found love in His amazing grace
AHHH!

Just wanted you to know that I love you and that you're really beautiful
Everything around you doesn't change me my loves the key
I'll wipe your tears away
Just wanted you to know that where you stand you can accept me for who I am
Just understand know that I can be a place where
It's okay

He loves you, yes
He loves you, yes
Jesus He loves you
And it's okay

He loves you, yes
He loves you, yes
And it's okay
And it's okay
