[Verse 1]
We about to forfeit our first freedom
Run and get your constitution kids
You are now looking through new lenses, new hinges
The door swings and the future enters
Don't it feel like we've been here before
In other times on American soil
I guess we're spoiled and pretend to ignore you
Because we're loyal to sin and immoral
Sweet land, (remember that) sweet land, (remember that) When we said "One nation under God indivisible"?
Sweet land, (remember that) sweet land, (remember that) When we said "Let freedom ring to every individual"?
Sweet land, (remember that) sweet land, (remember that) When we said "It was innate to express your religious liberty"?
Sweet land, (remember that) sweet land, (remember that) Then tell me why we quickly dismissing our own history
To our own misery

My country 'tis of thee
Sweet land of liberty
To thee I sing

[Verse 2]
We about to forfeit our first freedom
Run and get your constitution kids
Witness the moral revolution kids
Raise your hand you know what macro-evolution is
Keep'em up you know what macro-evolution did
Such an intrusion into the institutions it did
A lot of damage to the youth and polluting the kids
And scholars got college students doubting the truth again
Its absolute
(sweet land, sweet land) Some will say it started with Charles Darwin and evolution
(sweet land, sweet land) And now it has evolved and its causing a moral revolution
(sweet land, sweet land) We ignore the constitution and removing God from the solution
(sweet land, sweet land) So now Christians in American start preparing for persecution

Being Christian in America meant we were protected by the constitution. Being Christian in America meant our government could not interfere with our doctrines, disciplines, exercises, or institutions. And now through the secularization of the culture a new moral norm is being instituted. Today being christian in American means social execution if our religious liberties conflict with a more liberal resolution. They can threaten our freedom of speech, job security and other forms of exclusion, but one thing we've learned from history through the blood of the martyrs they can never stop the movement!

You are the light of the world/ of the world/ of the world (repeat)
You are the king on the throne/ on the throne/ on the throne (repeat)
