"Don't look for the line."
What do I mean by that?
Well, I've been asked a lot recently:
"Ryan, what do you mean?
You say there's progressive sanctification
Where we all stumble in many ways
And there's pattern sin
Where's the line?"
"I don't know where the line is."

I mean I know some things that are over the line
I know that
There are some things that are clearly pattern sin
I know some things that are over the line
I know some things that are just stumbling in many ways

"Where exactly, Ryan, is the line?"
"I have no idea where the line is."
And praise God scripture never gave us the line
You do not want to be as close to the line as you can
You want to be way over here

OK, so the couple
They're not married
They're in the backseat of the car
They're going like:
"Oh, how far can we go?"
Like, "What's allowed here?"
"Get out of the car!"
It'll all be OK outside the car

We should be making every effort
To add every bit of grace to our lives
We should be looking to Him
Adding the knowledge of Him to our lives
Pursuing Godliness

And by God, I mean that will all reverence
By God, we will grow in assurance that we are saved
We will not grow in assurance by always asking:
"Can I keep one foot close to the line?"
