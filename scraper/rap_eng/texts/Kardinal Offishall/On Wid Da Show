[Intro]
Are we on?
Turn me on
Are we on?
Are we on this?
Come on, come on, come on
Yeah
Check it

[Verse 1]
It was a cool and lonely
Offishall style that coerced her to smile
Chalk another to the file
Quest for breasts, my intent to impress the mistress
So cess broke the ice like Gretzky
I told she give me your signature or number
Lumber could follow if I check you tomorrow
Who, ate, simply went to my date's now my belle's apparatus
Is switched the player status with the baddest appeal
Why spoil the king's night
Eat chicken at three and the skin at four o'clock
Cool, again I reach the girl's door
Just call me FT 'cause her birthday suit is saw
Hit the floor in a hearts swift motion
Lotion the skin and like caress all me
In the cup (what), arm in the cup (what)
Hittin' that spot that's G, you know I do your head sheet
That the hit was a nap and the biggest episode
Took five minutes for the cannon to explode
She said do you love me and I said no
Then she slapped my face I grabbed her and said ho
Do that again and your story gets told
To stick it in was nice, but yo I'll get more
'Cause Offishall's out for mine and then some
I hit some and leave some then on wid da show
Word up

[Chorus]
One for the money and two's for my bros
And three is for the cause, pause
And four is for the tricks and stuff
Wanna bang with us, and again for the dough
Yo on wid da show
One for the money and two's for my bros
And three is for the cause, pause
And four is for the tricks and stuff
Wanna bang with us, and again for the dough
Yo on wid da show

[Verse 2]
I knew this girl named Susan
Fly skin from the islands, of Trini
Who always had a dress that's cut mini
And tempt to get praise and so the skin lay low
And only playin' hostess when niggas got dough
One day I see her rollin' with these niggas that I knew
Walkin' through the downtown about a half past two
So I warn my niggas word up she livin' foul
She just smiled and said 'Yo nigs yo know my style'
Cool, eh was that John Young
He took her to the palace his moms was not home
She undressed herself to reveal the irresistible
Coca-Cola body while he bobbin' like motorola
38-32-46 my my my
Only problem was she wouldn't spread her thighs
Said I need a hundred, my nigga said well
Just suck up on my jewels until my headpiece swell
Yo, she said do you love me and he said no
This queen got dressed he grabbed her and said ho
Do what you do but no duckets will flow
Nice try, on the real niggas only make dough
You didn't think so

[Chorus]
One for the money and two's for my bros
And three is for the cause, pause
And four is for the tricks and stuff
Wanna bang with us, and again for the dough
Yo on wid da show
One for the money and two's for my bros
And three is for the cause, pause
And four is for the tricks and stuff
Wanna bang with us, and again for the dough
Yo on wid da show

[Verse 3]
Now to my uptown rollers, go and get yours
If you're sippin' over proof inside a Lex Coupe
Shotgun, what's up with them niggas that passed
Real Gs make peace and get pieces that last (on the real)
On the real I ain't about bustin' steel
Praise the Almighty I won't sway not even slightly
Give thanks for my life and for my boys
And for my blood
For all them true heads that make noise
While niggas pose hard we do the Kardinal dance
While you're still leavin' a jam with your hands inside your pants
Kardinal Offishall will do it for you broke
Yo, cause one's for the money and we on wid da show
You didn't think so

[Chorus]
One for the money and two's for my bros
And three is for the cause, pause
And four is for the tricks and stuff
Wanna bang with us, and again for the dough
Yo on wid da show
One for the money and two's for my bros
And three is for the cause, pause
And four is for the tricks and stuff
Wanna bang with us, and again for the dough
Yo on wid da show
One for the money and two's for my bros
And three is for the cause, pause
And four is for the tricks and stuff
Wanna bang with us, and again for the dough
Yo on wid da show

[Outro]
Ms. Tara Chase, Kardinal
