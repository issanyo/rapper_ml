Coming up with a beat
Is all we seem to know
Making noise in the streets
We never stop the show
'Cause these is the all we got
'Cause these is the all we got
Keep waiting on the dollar bill
You're spending all your life now
Lord know we gonna keep it real
We got to do it right now
They never gon understand
How you spend your life now
Don't ever stop doing your thing
You know you're doing it right now
Right now
Right?
Right now
Right?
Coming up with a beat
Is all we seem to know
(It's all we know)
Making noise in the streets
We never stop the show
'Cause these is the all we got
(This is all we got, baby!)
'Cause these is the all we got
Spending my time cautiously
That's the price of living, what up?
It's hard to stay clean with all the trouble, I get in
I'm going broke paying attention to every detail
But forgetting to smell the roses
Living right under our noses
Dear Moses, I'm asking you
What would Jesus do?
'Cause trying to pay the rent with a clean heart
Isn't feasible
Love is unreasonable, but needed in the plot
Like the days of our live
We living whit, with all we got
Ya know?
Coming up with a beat
Is all we seem to know
Making noise in the streets
We never stop the show
'Cause these is the all we got
'Cause these is the all we got (Whoooooa)
'Cause these is the all we got
'Cause these is the all we got
'Cause these is the all we got
'Cause these is the all we got
They already know
This is all we got though
To all people everywhere, let's make it through
You know what I'm saying?
We feel your pain
We feel your shook
You know what I'm saying?
But sometimes when it's all you got
You just got to let it all out
You know what I mean?
Yeah!
It's The Knocks!
It's Kardinal Offishall!
Coming up with a beat
Coming up with a beat
Coming up with a beat
Coming up with a beat
Making noise in the streets
Making noise in the streets
Making noise in the streets
Making noise in the streets
'Cause these is the all we got (This all we got... this all we got)
'Cause these is the all we got
