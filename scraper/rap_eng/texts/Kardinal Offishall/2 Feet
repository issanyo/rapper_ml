[Verse 1: Kardinal Offishall]

I don’t want to be the bearer of bad news, but most news
Is filled with nothing but street blues
Mothers crying, so much chalk outlining
I’m finding it’s like we rewinding
Time after time, they don’t listen to “Self Destruction”, and they busting
Community cussing, “Fuck ‘em!’
They’re part of the design
The younger generation is lost, but not mine
Not my seed --No! The team of street dreamers outside my window
That’s letting the Moss blow
See my youth out playing, I see them but yo, it takes a village to raise them
And all the talking won’t phase them
While we scream “‘F’ The Police!”, and please don’t snitch
All the bad mine, youths outside will not switch
Shoulda got a switch from the diaper itch
Used to be rap, now the simps is too quick to say ‘Bitch!’
Yosemite Sam, toting two rifles
The law or something more keeps my two feet idle in the struggle

[Hook: Kardinal Offishall]
See my two feet, they stand up in the struggle
Niggas hustle and get to muscle up , get big checks. they run this here
See my two feet, they stand up in the struggle
Niggas hustle and muscle up rude boys around this here
See my two feet, they stand up in the struggle
Niggas hustle and and muscle up, coming at you with no fear

[Verse 2: Rakaa Iriscience]

Coming down, like “Blaow!”
Buckshot season peppers the block
While the Mighty Ducks creep, keep my weapons unlocked
Machete your mind flow, caravanner rhyme flow
Carnival Parade, High Grade got my eyes low
David House affiliated, ‘Firepower’ rap blaze
Dilated ‘Marathon’, we outrunning the rat race
Like Prince in the “Black” Rain , or Jimmy in “Black” Haze
See me in that Black Range, I'm rollin’ with Black Jays
Black Panthers, Brown Berets
Revelation’s in effect, count down the days
Chant down Babylon, kneel down and pray
Make a point with every thorn in my Crown displayed
L-Dot-A-Dot, T-D-O-T
Beatwise, killin’ whatever bangs, we O-G
I’m Rakaa, I’m too strong, your weak, you’re too sweet
These streets will lift you two feet, off your two feet
