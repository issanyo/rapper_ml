[Verse 1: Kardinal Offishall]
Pst, hey x3
I ain't never seen terrible fold
One pretty little chick trying to run out through the back door
So I stepped to the left, puffed out the chest
So fly had to show her that S
That action, distraction, make this a chain reaction
She was more than a ten
Her and her friends made their own money and had their own ends
Yeoah, Yeoahh
Come here and let me show you, show your pretty face more than dough, d-dough
You stay here and let your girl go
I don't mean, mean no harmin'
I want to show you the Rude Boy charmin'
Give me the signal I'm on it
That there body need wantin'

[Chorus: Chaisson]
Yo that chick, she's fine
And you know she's 'bout it
And how she looks, she's mine
She's all I want and I need
No lie, I ain't wasting no time
You see no fooling around because
Hol' up, wait a minute
That chick, that chick right there [x8]

[Verse 2: Kardinal Offishall]
She seem like a quiet girl
You know I don't buy it, not for a sec, on your mark, get set
Everything you protect is out
And I'm trynna see what you all about
Are you a Gemini? Or a Leo?
I'm a Taurus check out my ego
A little famous, check out your te-vo
Want to see a pretty gal go weeoh
Yo I'm on in good company
And a quick check, let me put you in check
Come erect when it comes to the sweat running down your neck from the DJ set (pull out pull out)
Blonde, red head or brunette (pull out pull out)
I see you rollin' it like roulette (pull out pull out)
From the front view to the silhouette, you a threat
Even now they boy in debt

[Chorus: Chaisson]

[Verse 3: Kardinal Offishall]
She a little off to the left
Skirt showing all the goodies that she got left
Now you off to the right
With about five guys following behind her all night
She comes them seems to the test
That seam cannot cover the breast
Heart pumping like a twenty minute workout
She in control, keep Captain Kirk out
See the twerk that, see the body bounce
You know that she only dips when it really counts
Animal prints on all them garments, give me one touch I'm on it

[Chorus: Chaisson]
