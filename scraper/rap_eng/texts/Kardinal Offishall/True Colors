You with the sad eyes, don’t be discouraged
Oh I realize, it’s hard to take courage
In a world full of people, you can lose sight of it
And the darkness inside you makes you feel so small

But I see your true colors shinig through
I see your true colors, that’s why I love you
So don’t be afraid to let them show your true colors
True colors are beautiful
Like a rainbow
(Oh oh oh oh, Oh oh oh oh, Oh oh oh oh)
Like a rainbow
(Oh oh oh oh, Oh oh oh oh, Oh oh oh oh)

Show me a smile then, don’t be unhappy
Can’t remember when I last saw you laughing
If this world makes you crazy and you’ve taken all you can bear
You call me up because you know I’ll be there

I see your true colors shining through
I see your true colors, that’s why I love you
So don’t be afraid to let them show your true colors
True colors are beautiful (Cheer up!) like a rainbow

I see your colors though they appear to be different
You should never be afraid because your difference is the difference
We live in a time where to be yourself is hard
And the way you really feel can leave you emotional scar
But stay strong, stay firm and never back down
Being yourself is the only way to act that
(Like a rainbow)
Trust me, I’m a fighter and a lover
But the only time I fight is to reveal my true colors
You know
(Oh oh oh oh, Oh oh oh oh, Oh oh oh oh)

I see your true colors shining through
I see your true colors, that’s why I love you
So don’t be afraid to let them show your true colors
True colors are beautiful like a rainbow
Like a rainbow
Your true colors, yeah
Your true colors, yeah
I see them, your true colors
You with your sad eyes
