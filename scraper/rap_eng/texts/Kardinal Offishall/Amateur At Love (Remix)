[Verse 1: Karl Wolf]
I don't want to believe it's over
But walking away from the love she gave is an easier hand to play
So I don't want to beat myself up
Completely wrong, she hanging on to every word I say

[Pre-Chorus: Karl Wolf]
See all the crazy, hot girls at the show
See all my boys doing dirt on the low
Losing you was like a low blow
I'm an amateur at love but I can't let it go so

[Chorus: Karl Wolf]
Act act act like a bachelor
Amateur at love
I know what you want but I act like a bachelor
I'm an amateur at love
To the love, to the love I'm an amateur

[Verse 2: Kardinal Offishall]
[?] but in love, I'm an amateur
Protect yourself emotionally, I will damage ya
The way I look at you is the parameter
I play the role but you off the gold calibre
You deserve all the love through the calendar
We together but I act like a bachelor
It ain't right cause your love is a balancer
Cupid give her a valentine massacre

[Pre-Chorus: Karl Wolf]
You see all the crazy, hot girls at the show
You see all my boys doing dirt on the low
Losing you was like a low blow
I'm a winner in the street but an amateur at love

[Chorus: Karl Wolf]
Act act act like a bachelor
Amateur at love
I know what you want but I act like a bachelor
I'm an amateur at love
To the love, to the love I'm an amateur
