So I was like aight yo, can I get into it
My crew down to do it, if she gonna pursue it
And before I even knew it, out she came
With the tight gold clip, and the dark brown frame
[Unverified] she said she needed Money, Jane, how she see me I forget, get
The first time we met couldn't keep me eyes shut, shut
She give me bling, bling, I bring me wooley par a set, set
When me check it out she's the agent of debt, debt
Yo, she one of them freaks that will relax your mind
Till you get burnt out and you need the next dime
To reinvent the last time, when she got you that, that
Legs hustle out the Land Rover
Rolex 'pon me wrist and a crisp pullover
Plat i num chain wit ring and ice all over
On the bus' out the suit without dem string ya
The only problem she won't keep it a secret
She buys nigga's ice, she pays my rent
She cousins with Master carder and cent (true!)
Monopoly is real life when you're fine
She the head of the game, my homegirl Money Jane
Hopelessly adventures of Miss Money Jane
Blind your ass, while you out looking for that money train
If you look then you will find, but think about what you looking for
2-3, 2-3, you'll see
Yo, me and MJ go back to the eighties
She used to roll with my family to J-A
VA, SC and even GA
I used to spend her in Decatur on the daily
Visiting my auntie, we went world wide
She met every single girl I had, no lie
And then one of my ex-girls brought me to the side and said
M-Jane is tearing up my insides
I Couldn't hear that, I need her in my life
I'm like the big King and she like my Queen wife
She look.. goood in denim, then I met her in leather
Just right in linen, and so fine in good weather
In the summertime, she on my ass
At the barbecues, buying me a drink without asking
When she with me, she be looking out for me simple and plain
My homegirl Money Jane
Hopelessly adventures of Miss Money Jane
Blind your ass, while you out looking for that money train
If you look then you will find, but think about what you looking for
True true

Yo
She get around, she get around a lot
And when ya check it out, she a bust on the spot
She get around, she get around a lot
From Paris to New York and she come back
She get around, she move around a lot
And when ya check it out, she a bust on the spot
She get around, she move around a lot
From Kingston, JA, right up to T-dot
Pon the level
Funny how we only know that
And a dull life, when she a run out
Ka we love live cycle
Funny make me run everywhere
But when it in the door, at dat time we return up on the money rebel
Only buy the food FoodyMart, M'nogamous start, how do ya dun know we live comfortable
Only make the gun them bust out
And people in the dark, how you don't know someone
Your the devil

My homegirl Money Jane, I say again
Everybody needs her simple and plain
My homegirl Money Jane
My homegirl Money Jane
Hopelessly adventures of Miss Money Jane
Blind your ass, while you out looking for that money train
