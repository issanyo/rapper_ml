[Chorus: Kardinal Offishall & L.J.]
It's been a long time waiting, for a good time around me
Sweet baby
{Bring it in, bring it in like so, yeah}
It's been a long time waiting, for a good time around me
Sweet baby

[Verse 1: Kardinal Offishall]
After the sunlight my niggas shines on like a diamond
Cool in my mind, finding time to chill
Ill thoughts corrupt my senses
Caressing my eye lenses, mending my personals
My nigga's eyes are black and easy to see through (true)
Into the soul, all attempts have been made to link up with that cool strut
But they get brushed to the side (right, right)
My nigga's with me for the long ride
Over and over, explosions like a supernova
Some say a superhoe but never go there
My nigga is for me and that's all she be, for real
For fake never, ever disrespect my lifeline
My nigga makes my water wine, while I worship the waist line
Waste time sometimes, could you do we have to rep
Cause you can not beat no face with your crew (true)
Something about my nigga that make me act ill
I can't figure it out, but I ain't trying
Denying what's true to me, you don't even matter see (see)
Cause the cat rules everything around me (word)
Sometime I disrespect my crew, but you they know how we do
Cause we all bounced the ball out the blue
In fact it's wack sometimes, never will I dis my girl, how you figure
She my nigga
In fact it's wack sometimes, but never will I dis my girl
How you figure, yeah she my nigga
Word, life

[Chorus: Kardinal Offishall & L.J.]
It's been a long time waiting, for a good time around me
Sweet baby
{Bring it in, bring it in like so, yeah}
It's been a long time waiting, for a good time around me
Sweet baby

[Verse 2: L.J.]
It's like this when I bust the swiftness off of the top
I need a nigga to pickup the feelings when I feel like dropping
Stopping all the stress I got, press up against my chest
Forget about the rest of the worries
Cause the world is just a mess
I need a nigga I can kick it with at anytime whatever whenever
I provide the time as long as we're together
Forever I will watch your back, as long as you watch mine
With you, everything is fine because I regained my peace of mind
And hate those other fraud niggas walking around like thy much bigger than
Eye & I, you couldn't even try to be my nigga
Forget that nigga, that nigga's sits on someone elses
Forget the other that only bothers with the riches
Can't sweat the next and the rest there's only God and me as bitches
Immature, know only as snitches talking your business
My nigga is my partner, my shorty, my lady
The one I'm chilling with when everybody else is crazy
And against me, the very last person to understand me
The outlet to release the stress, and fixations held within me
My girl's had the most the rest the nigga's them couldn't test my nigga
Cause life she is God almighty, too extract for you to figure

[Chorus: Kardinal Offishall & L.J.]
It's been a long time waiting, for a good time around me
Sweet baby
{Bring it in, bring it in like so, yeah}
It's been a long time waiting, for a good time around me
Sweet baby
It's been a long time waiting, for a good time around me
Sweet baby
{Bring it in, bring it in like so, yeah}
It's been a long time waiting, for a good time around me
Sweet baby

[Outro: Kardinal Offishall & L.J.]
(Baby darling)
It's like that and a (baby)
And like that and a...
You don't stop and a...
And it goes like so
It goes like uh
Like this, hit me like that
And it goes like so (baby darling, baby)
