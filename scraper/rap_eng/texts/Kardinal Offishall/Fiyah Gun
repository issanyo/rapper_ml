[Chorus:]
Fiyah Gun
The ghetto red hot, ghetto yutes fiyah gun
Capone leads to corrupt you wouldn’t stop in kingston
Every where there's war
Keep your sniff and what’s on, what’s on(right)
Fiyah Gun
The ghetto red hot, ghetto yutes fiyah gun
Gun [x10]

[Verse 1:]
Every day, life is a struggle for me
If i don't do it, who else gonna hustle for me
Believe in me, invest, achieve with me
If you don’t starve, how you gonna eat with me
These streets is hell for young black males
Take the cell, crack the jail
Our options are few, temptation is plenty
For someone with my eyes and skin dark as penny
Raised up in Babylon, kings and kings from the sun
Enslave us Africans, raised me to carry gun
Hungry man, angry man
Likkle yute beg a man
His to shoot, ring alarm
Preacher going sing a song, chant a song rappa pom
Big up Junior Gong
Welcome to bucktown
Get fuck by rider, wrong a whole system corrupt now
Illegal biz control the district
Original gun flick, bun a natural mystic

[Chorus]

[Verse 2:]
Yeah, blazing, blazing
Yute dem bad and brazen
Dem yute like adventure, like Babylon dem fiyah cave in
Send some wid natural live wires, intelligent arranging
Ain’t no mad and crazy riot when di fiyah raging
Blaze up, blaze up
Ghetto yutes a raise up
Now dem get dem full awareness, Babylon yuh days up
Declaration of the rights rastafari gave us
Every man have a right to decide his, own destiny and right wi neva gave up
Mentally and physically they wanna enslave us
Nah guh be dem sacrifice in dis age  await us
Fight fi life and hear mi culture, a rastafari save us
Up di sword and draw mi shield, a bakkle field suh brave up
Gates up, gates up
Mek mi talk bout, don’t touch

[Chorus]

[Verse 3:]
Walk on the avenue
Chat with Fox scuffing, kicking knowledge
Tired of seeing ghetto children with nothing
Kids robbing before they three square
Sticking up three square
Hands to the sky, soul searching, wearing cheap hairs
Guns busting, blades sticking
Bandanas covered the stricken
Many of my niggas ain’t niggas
The story was written by the corrupted who’s only goal is to oppress
If I ain’t believe in jah, put a hole right through their chest
But am civilize, focus on breaking into their system
Stacking paper isn’t the goal, is the intermission
Direct your mind’s energies, not on your enemies
But rather on increasing your charity over centuries
This is meant to warfare with solidarity
My legacy is something to celebrate over century

[Chorus]

[Verse 3:]
Listen now
Am like the trees by the rivers planted
Babylonian wud a prefer si wi running wanted
Wicked means rewind, the gunshot means forward
Yuh request this suh we rewind
Gun, Gun, Gun, Gun
Am like the trees by the rivers planted
Babylonian wud a prefer si wi running wanted
The yutes dem hungry, and di yutes dem want bread
Dem waan fi kill wi when wi have wi tings a walk wid
Listen now
Dem nuh waan wi fi survive in a di streets
General yuh know di ends affi guh meet
Di yutes dem have dem goal dem would a want fi live fi see it
We working hard, stay firm up pon yuh feet
