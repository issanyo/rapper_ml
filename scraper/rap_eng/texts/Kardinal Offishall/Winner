[Intro - Kardinal Offishall]:
Yo yo
Joey Montana
Kardinal

[Verse 1 - Pree]:
I feel, so good inside
You're my elevation
I need you in my life

I feel, like you're my fire
Addicted to your touch
You are my one supplier

[Pre-Chorus - Pree]:
Occupied with your love, ohhh
Put in work to get fly, ohhh
Friday night I got money
Just enough to get by, ohhh
I can't stop this feeling
I see how they try though
Letter to the one I love

[Chorus - Pree]:
You made me a winner
Ohhh
You made me a winner
Ohhh
You made me a winner
Ohhh
You made me a winner
Ohhh

[Verse 2 - Joey Montana]:
Tu amor me eleva por las nubes
Y me sube (yo yo yo yo yo)
Y eres lo que nunca tuve
No lo dudes (yo yo yo yo yo)
Ehh, es que a mi vida tu le diste un upgrade
Son muchos que te quieren pero no le doy break
Walking like a champion 'cause I'm feeling so great
Que te tengo everyday
Tu amor me eleva por las nubes
Y me sube (yo yo yo yo yo)
Y eres lo que nunca tuve
No lo dudes (yo yo yo yo yo Joey)

[Pre-Chorus - Pree]:
Occupied with your love, ohhh
Put in work to get fly, ohhh
Friday night I got money
Just enough to get by, ohhh
I can't stop this feeling
I see how they try though
Letter to the one I love

[Chorus]

[Verse 3 - Kardinal Offishall]:

Soft ting shoutout to my queen looking for a king

[Pre-Chorus - Pree]:
Occupied with your love, ohhh
Put in work to get fly, ohhh
Friday night I got money
Just enough to get by, ohhh

I see how they try though
Letter to the one I love

[Chorus]
