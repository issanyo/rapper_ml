[Verse One: Big Shot Manceeni]
Look
Police wanna eyeball the villain
I came from the bottom I'm plotting my next killing
This is premeditated I plan on making a killing
Your arms are too short, you can't fight the feeling
Give 'em straight head shots, [?] to kill 'em
Rappers get terminated while cameras doing the filming
Now it's, shots firing, a straight tyrant
Big Shot is the "iller" since the "K" silent
Look
Feet on your back, kickback like a Desert Ea's
Rhymes is tight, never is the dungarees
Stomp MC's, spikes on the bottom
It won't stop stomping until they body start rotting
Look
I'm here to make millions swimming
In a pool of sharks and I got more balls than the billiard
Dress up like a yellow, disrespect me and I steal ya
Guerrilla with salmonella, I'm all about the skrilla
It's hard to stay calm when you drop napalm
Black like Akon, in the sun baking

[Khizman]
It's the Return Of The Living Dead, straight violence
You just a peasant and Khizman is your highness
Trophy winner, Virginia is where you find us
Looking for gold ever since I was a minor/miner
So def/deaf translators throwing me signs up
Whenever beats get murdered, I'm in the line up
My pen leave permanent burn marks
Die for the love of the track like Earnhardt
{Car crashes}
I'm dope
The neighbors call the D's when I rap
So fresh it smell like Febrese when I rap
X mark the spot, DMP's on the map
With gorilla niggas hanging from the trees in a sack

[Hook: Kardinal Offishall]
We be the night, night riders, riders
Riding in all black with a strap under the lap
Police in the back, tired niggas don't crack
If you wit' it nigga show me where you at
Cause we night, night riders

[Verse Two: Starboy]
I sit down, put the pen to the pad and get busy
Money make the world go round and I'm trying to get dizzy
Look
If it's all in the game, homie just play ball
My niggas is full throttle soon as the play call
Ery'body some killers claiming they bang tho'
But they ain't in the streets so I'm looking on Fandango
Them niggas actors
The one that talk the most shit get killed first, consider 'em non factors
It's I sire the live wire, the Dylan, that spit hot fire
Hard lot rottweiler
(You smart ass niggas)
You'se a part time dummy
(You a full time hustler)
With some part time money nigga

[Verse Three: Boogieman]
I get money stay out of the orbit of them losers
Your whole team suck, a bunch of fucking Hoovers
I'm an over doer, did it all before ya
I need an A&E special cause for paper I'm a Hoarder
Yeah
Boogie, Boogie I gets busy
And I done everything in V.A. but fuck Missy
I said I did everything in V.A. come fuck with me
Everybody get a cut, I'm giving out buck fifties
What?
I'm chasing doe with my play clothes
You got your cape on trying to save hoes
I keep a shooter in my payroll
You ain't never had work, you're like a pay phone
You're nowhere nigga, you stay home
It's like I took a blue boy cause yeah we stay on
I said we stay on

[Hook]
