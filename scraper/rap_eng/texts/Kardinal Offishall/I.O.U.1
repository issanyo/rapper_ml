[Chorus]
You take a girl on a few nice trips
Let a girl sit in a few nice whips
I guess you feel like I owe you one
I guess you want me to show you something
So you got momma a brand new bag
Hoping momma gonna feel that swag
I guess you feel like I owe you one
I guess you want me to show you something

[Verse 1]
You say you like to go shopping (Eh)
You wanna take me out
(You wanna take me out?)
You buy me a little something something
Saying that it's nothin
But I know what it's about
But you don't wanna play dress up (Eh)
You wanna take me down
Guess you figured a trinket or two
Would get you a ticket into what's under my blouse

[Chorus]
You take a girl on a few nice trips
Let a girl sit in a few nice whips
I guess you feel like I owe you one
I guess you want me to show you something
So you got momma a brand new bag
Hoping momma gonna feel that swag
I guess you feel like I owe you one
I guess you want me to show you something

[Post-Chorus]
You be breathin down my neck
Breathin breathin down my neck
You be breathin down my neck
Breathin breathin down my neck
I guess you feel like I owe you one
(Oh you think that I owe you?)
I guess you want me to show you something

[Verse 2]
You say you wanna give me the world
Said you're looking for a special girl
I ain't buying it so stop trying it
You just wanna hit
No you're not getting it
You say that I deserve diamonds and pearls
The gucci the furs la perla the works
I ain't buying it so stop trying it
You just wanna hit-no

[Chorus]
You take a girl on a few nice trips
Let a girl sit in a few nice whips
I guess you feel like i owe you one
I guess you want me to show you something
So you got momma a brand new bag
Hoping momma gonna feel that swag
I guess you feel like i owe you one
I guess you want me to show you something

[Post-Chorus]
You be breathin down my neck
Breathin breathin down my neck
You be breathin down my neck
Breathin breathin down my neck
I guess you feel like i owe you one
(Oh you think that i owe you?)
I guess you want me to show you something
(Oh you want me to show you?)
I guess you feel like i owe you one
I guess you want me to show you something

[Bridge]
Oh I wish that you could see
How foolish you look
You tryin to get my honey
And I find it very funny
Cuz you look just like a dummy
Plus I got my own money
Oh I wish that you could see
How foolish you look
I'm so unimpressed
All of your tactics
Your trying to play this game
But I think you need practice
Oh oh oh

[Post-Chorus and chorus]
Breathin breathin down my neck
Breathin breathin down my neck
I guess you feel like I owe you one
I guess you want me to show you something
Bre bre breathin down my neck
Wa wa want me to show you something
Sho sho sho you something
Bre bre breathin down my neck
You take a girl on a few nice trips
Let a girl sit in a few nice whips
I guess you feel like I owe you one
