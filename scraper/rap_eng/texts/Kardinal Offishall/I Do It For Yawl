"Fresh...for you"

[Verse One][Nottz]:
Let me read what's in this envelope
Another fan wrote:
"Your boy like cooked coke
I'm lovin' what you did for the rap world and all
Still humble in the game, over the years ain't nothin' change
Same hard ass drums, incredible bass lines
Fuck sugar coatin' shit, you one of the top five, dead or alive
Some dudes used to say that you wouldn't survive
Cause you be samplin' and shit but you ain't pay it no mind
Cause see, some of these cats ain't got the will to survive
Yeah, they beats aight, but they ain't got that drive
They ain't got that consistency to taste that life
That you got
You you Nottz?
I'll ride or die
I make beats myself, any advice for the kid?
Nottz I need help
I've been doin' this for years with the help of nobody else
It's you I look up to cause you do it for us

[Chorus] [Nottz]:
This is all for my fans, I do it for
(YAWL)
Everybody round the world, you know this for
(YAWL)
Real music y'all, custom made for all
(YAWL)
I do it for
(YAWL)
This is all
"For you"
Show love, I couldn't have done it without
(YAWL)
More than 10 years in the game, for this I thank
(YAWL)
Love still the same, ain't nothin' changed, I love
(YAWL)
I do it for
(YAWL)
This is all
"for you"

[Verse Two] [Nottz]
I got another fan letter in the mail
I can't tell who it's from, the ends faded
And from the stamp I can make out it was sent from Canada
Kardinal from there, so let my nigga talk about it

[Kardinal Offishall]:
Dear Nottz, I'm a fan, somethin' similar to Stan
Just without the blond hair
Every beat you ever made is dismantlin' the game
Smashin' these suckers
Snoop Dogg know it, ask R. Kelly fuckers
That's the best beat that he ever sang on period
Who's sayin' you ain't the truth?
Rap ain't hearin' it
Little Brother told me, check M.O.P
Busta Rhymes said Doc Dre and X to the Z
Is all students of bass lines, spittin' over history
In present day time, nobody got the fire like you
Beat battles, you against the whole crew
It's like Superman goin' against Care Bear Blue
Tryin' to be like you
But I ain't got the productivity
Snares are like a gun, your snares are electricity
Shockin' any Fruity Loop, Logic shut down
Akai's are paralyzed when raw is in town
I'm a fan my nigga!

[Chorus]:
I do it for
(YAWL)
Everybody round the world, you know this for
(YAWL)
Real music y'all, custom made for all
(YAWL)
I do it for
(YAWL)
This is all
"For you"
And show love, I couldn't have done it without
(YAWL)
More than 10 years in the game, for this I thank
(YAWL)
Love still the same, ain't nothin' changed, I love
(YAWL)
I do it for
(YAWL)
This is all
"for you"

[Verse Three] [Nottz]:
'Bout to open another one and this came from North Cackalack
"Little Brother all day nigga!" written on the back
Big Pooh and Phonte, they my niggas, in fact
I'ma send them a track or two, let me see what they up to

[Phonte]:
What up Nottz? It's Phontigga, let me rep you real quick
Cause I've been checkin' for you every since
Like '98 with +Extinction Level Event+
The way that +Everybody Rise+ used to set off the disc
Had everybody thinkin' this is how the shit should be
Cause we ain't nod our heads, we shook our heads in disbelief

[Big Pooh]:
And so when youngins think you're new to the beats
I run your catalog
Real live in stereo, no analog
The blueprint if you're tryin' to use the ASR
You know you better than the rest cause they ain't up to par

[Phonte]:
And you can call me +Barry Bonds+, yep here's another hit
Plus you put it down on that +Life Of The Party+ shit
A pleasure and an honor to record on it
Got these beat makers thinkin' "Why the fuck I never thought of this?"

[Big Pooh]:
Because they ain't Nottz raw, homie you a shinin' star
Diamond in the rough, Rapper Pooh now signin' off

[Chorus]:
This is all for my fans, I do it for
(YAWL)
Everybody round the world, you know this for
(YAWL)
Real music y'all, custom made for all
(YAWL)
I do it for
(YAWL)
This is all
"For you"
And show love, I couldn't have done it without
(YAWL)
More than 10 years in the game, for this I thank
(YAWL)
Love still the same, ain't nothin' changed, I love
(YAWL)
I do it for
(YAWL)
This is all
"for you"
