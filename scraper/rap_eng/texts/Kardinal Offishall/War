[Verse 1]
Heyyo, this hip hop shit’s like a groupie nowadays
It’s too easy to fuck with, plus it go both ways
Anybody with a grill and a dick
Can come and get a number one hit and that’s it
Common used to love her, but even DMC don’t fuck with her
Since she hooked up with Danny Glover
She’s Hollywood, nigga
Fake ass dudes with no clues and Pro Tools
And Bathing Ape shoes is who niggas pay money for
Well get out your checkbook, real niggas rappin’ this here
My name’s Kardinal, came from the indie scene
When niggas still press vinyl for the promo team
When niggas still used twelves, when Preemo’s beats were still law
In between Hard Knock Life and Raw
I’m in between shit you never saw
And that boom bap rap that made you take your tape deck off pause

[Hook]
This means war
Y’all act like niggas ain’t bringin’ the real shit no more
This means war
Y’all act like niggas ain’t still bringin’ the real hardcore

[Verse 2]
One for the money, two’s for the skill
Three’s for all my niggas who sample Kill Bill
Four’s for the DJs who still carry crates
And five’s for wack niggas getting punched in the face
For spitting that bullshit, bringin’ down the curve
In the name of hip hop, nigga you got some nerve
I ain’t a backpack underground lyrical miracle bus-ridin’, shell-toed dude
But I'll still eat your food
On any given Sunday
Cool J or not I’ma rock them bells and get paid like J Foxx
No actin’, just give me the reel-to-reel
Like [?], I’m thorough like a Navy Seal
In every borough, but I ain’t busting shots for George
Tryna bust on the track and clear racks in stores
With M. Polo on the kick, it’s like Pele on the MP
I’m crack, even Joe gotta envy

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
I turned on the radio and laughed to myself
Nowadays anybody wear diamonds in they belt
And a target on they back for the shots
And hate for the cops go pop without giving a second thought
Fuck that, nigga, I’ma go pop too
Two shots in their head just to clear out the room
Grab that microphone and show you who’s boss
And rep for the hoods like a burning cross
But just without Bush and the rest of the gang
They got up in with more girls than K.D. Lang
Ellen, and Bill Clinton combined
Must be a sign of the times
Nigga read my face, you can’t fuck with the lines
Every time you think I ain’t got no more heat
I just call Marco Polo and I destroy the beat
I’m a tyrannosaurus without a thesaurus
Niggas get ate, get a verse before my release date
There it is
One more time my nigga
I’m a tyrannosaurus without a thesaurus
Niggas get ate, get a verse before my release date
There it is

[Hook]
