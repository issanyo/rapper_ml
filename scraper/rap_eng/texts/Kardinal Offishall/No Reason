[Intro]
Alright man the following song contains motherfucking bad words
Just so you listening

[Hook]
No Reason
Throwing money in the air for no reason
Pouring liquor on the floor for no reason
Look 'pon them, I don't need a reason
Burrr, skrt
I don't need a reason


[Verse 1]
Look 'pon them fool dem (nigga)
Showing off like the first school day (nigga)
I don't really care about any money that anybody making
Nigga I'm on a role, yeah (nigga)
I came from the hood like the next guy (nigga)
Reppin' from the east to the west side (nigga)
Only difference I ain't on no goon thing
Them niggas is coons, they say God is gonna bless thy (nigga)
Wonder if them rap niggas heard that (nigga)
Probably too worried where the birds at (burrr)
I am more concerned for my people from Africa living right there where the curb at (nigga)
I'm talking that talk, they don't hear me though (nigga)
With the big chain on, but they see me though (nigga)
Careful what you wishing, my mission is make you listen
Cooking crack up in the kitchen, pissing all up in the video
What me say? (What me say?)
You don't hear me though

[Hook]
Standing on top of the chair for no reason
Throwing money in the air for no reason
Pouring liquor on the floor for no reason
Burrr, skrt
I don't need a reason
Ayeeee No, I don't need a reason
Ayeeee No, I don't need a reason
AyeeeeNo, I don't need a reason
(Look 'pon dem) I don't need a reason
Burrr, skrt, I don't need a reason

[Verse 2]
On the real, I don't really care (nigga)
Do what you do my nigga, hell yeah (nigga)
Pour a little liquor the police is coming the get yeah
From the picture that you posted
The custy is overdosing
And they saying that you sold them what they died from (nigga)
Thing 'dem look sticky can't lie song (nigga)
No bother look at me, I'm just a square who seen his fair share of real niggas with a real bad outcome
Me and Five-0 is like apartheid (nigga)
They say I work for the wrong side (nigga)
I try to be friendly but most of them would wanna send me
To prison without a key cause I'm black I'm free
F that
I'ma ride for the new day (nigga)
I don't care what 'dem say don't shoot them (nigga)
The more that you become the enemy is the more that the killers and hoes are gonna recruit them (nigga)
Who dem? Slow down

[Hook]
Standing on top of the chair for no reason
Throwing money in the air for no reason
Pouring liquor on the floor for no reason
I don't need a reason
Burrr, skrt
I don't need a reason
Ayeeee No, I don't need a reason
Ayeeee No, I don't need a reason
Ayeeee No, I don't need a reason
I don't need a reason
Burrr, skrt, I don't need a reason

[Verse 3]
Maybe you listened but maybe you didn't (nigga)
It doesn;t really matter it's your decision my (nigga)
All I'm tryna do is get through to my niggas that'll only pay attention when they hear me say (nigga)
Maybe on day we will really ride (nigga)
Come together fighting for the bigger pride (nigga)
Until then I will just keep spitting nitrogen
Talking 'bout revolution inside of the pen (nigga, nigga, nigga)

[Hook]
Standing on top of the chair for no reason
Throwing money in the air for no reason
Pouring liquor on the floor for no reason
I don't need a reason
Burrr, skrt
I don't need a reason

[Outro]
It institutionalized slavery, family
You don't see what they doing out there my nigga
There's almost as many niggas in jail as there is in college my nigga
My nigga
You gotta do what you gotta do fuck what they telling you out there my nigga
It's bigger than that
There is a reason
