[Intro: Kardinal Offishall]
Sweet Marie

[Chorus: Nicole Sinclair]
So sweet so sweet so sweet
Oh sweet Marie, Marie, Marie
So sweet so sweet so sweet
Oh come on, sweet Marie
So sweet so sweet so sweet
Yeah
So sweet so sweet so sweet

[Verse 1: Kardinal Offishall]
Sweetest Marie, it is to thee that I dedicate
Me, myself and I for all of eterni-tie
Without you I wouldn't have made it this far, this far
Tell me how to live right and how to live wrong too
But it only made me stronger
Wisest of wise enough, strongest of the strong
Now who love what I see
In life, before me, stands a headstrong woman
Overworked and underpaid, stress ridden
First class middle class person
Type rehearsing of your values
Made an easy path for me to be who I be (let's see)
One half of my creation, 100% Jamaican
50% T-dot, 50% not anything mentioned before
But pure unadulterated love
Even though sometimes I can't get down with your actions
I'm passing that, for the positive things that I see in you
Dedicated to the one sweet Marie

[Chorus: Nicole Sinclair]
So sweet so sweet so sweet
Oh sweet Marie, Marie, Marie
So sweet so sweet so sweet
Oh come on, sweet Marie
So sweet so sweet so sweet
Yeah
So sweet so sweet so sweet

[Verse 2: Kardinal Offishall]
Giving birth to a black man in this land
Is similar to angels being placed in the palm of the devil's hand
Corruption all around and surrounded by greed and lust
And trust (trust), that you will appear when the sun
But I am not one, all praises due to my mother
I love my father too, but sweet Marie there ain't no other
That show me more than you, how to stay out of the devil's reaches
Pushing me to profit, rocking funky in peaches
Society's leeches, teachers do yourself
And all your sister's need, in pursuit of higher wealth
Sweet Marie regardless of the treatment of your family
Despite of what you don't have, you'll always have me
Cause me and you we're tight, you respect my life's path
When I'm in a position, in those who deserve it feel the wrath
Of disrespecting you, we have the highest principles of blood
It runs thicker than water, but hurts
That's when eye's blood, sweet Marie

[Chorus: Nicole Sinclair]
So sweet so sweet so sweet
Oh sweet Marie, Marie, Marie
So sweet so sweet so sweet
Oh come on, sweet Marie
So sweet so sweet so sweet
Yeah
So sweet so sweet so sweet

[Verse 3: Kardinal Offishall]
Staying at a friend's house, cause Hydro is not paid
Suffering in the dead of winter left dreaming of a grave
Or atleast someone to save, is the feelings I remember
Cold play in the Shakespeare on the Holy in December
Never lived in the ghetto but suffer the circumstance
Circumstantial evidence reveals the nature of my residence
My presence and present, is the love and strength of blackness
Fibers of a genocide and presence during Mantis(?)
Because of my Mom, I've experienced parts of life
My nigga could not relate to, but whose to shay that it's for better
Couldn't afford to buy me leather, but my body stayed warm
Couldn't afford to buy me diamonds, but I still had charm
She could afford to give me knowledge, and teach to speak truth
She taught me black lies were white reali-tie
Forever and a day gee, I will bleed for my family
F-O-S brothers and the one sweet Marie

[Chorus: Nicole Sinclair]
So sweet so sweet so sweet
Oh sweet Marie, Marie, Marie
So sweet so sweet so sweet
Oh come on, sweet Marie
So sweet so sweet so sweet
Yeah
So sweet so sweet so sweet
