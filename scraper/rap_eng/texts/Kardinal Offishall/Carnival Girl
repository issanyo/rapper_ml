[Texas] (Kardinal Offishall)
See me in the morning light
A photograph of pure delight
Yeah but I left too soon
(I don't see you girl)
There were some good times we had
And there were some that weren't so bad
Oh just feel it now lets feel it now

[Kardinal Offishall]
Yoh yo I remember what we used to do
Blink up and dream a living with the notion to
I'll give you the sun, the stars and the blue sky too
So come on a leasing wanna pleasing you
Remember when we used to link up with the crew
Suze and Suzette and Tanya too
You're the one on me side, when me ask you to
It's just a party now
Yo, I believe in you, I ain't leaving you

[Chorus: Texas]
Ooh come on let's get down tonight
Come on let's get down tonight
Join the carnival of love ooh
Well you sing it now, take it now
Join the carnival of love

[Kardinal Offishall]
Come on join in the carnival of love yeah

[Texas]
I watch the laughter in your eyes
I see the wrinkles change in size
Yeah, time has left you now
Lovers may have tried to be
Everything that's strange in me
Oh much deeper now, much deeper now

[Kardinal Offishall]
Much deeper
Yo, I used to love it when we used to play
It used to be like a weekend everyday
Three times at night when I came everyway
Body to body make you scream and say
Physically dance
You're not easy, take it easy
For again we are love, at one with the pope
And you stay on my mind
So lets go to the party girl
That we leave behind

[Chorus: Texas] (Kardinall Offishall)
Ooh come on let's get down tonight
Come on let's get down tonight
Join the carnival of love ooh
Well you sing now, take it now
Join the carnival of love
(Come on join in the carnival of love, yeah)
Ooh come on let's get down tonight
Come on let's get down tonight
Join the carnival of love ooh
Well you sing it now, take it now
Join the carnival of love
(I believe in you, I ain't leaving you, yo yo)

[Texas] (Kardinal Offishall)
Push it now, push it now

Stop me now
Push it now, push it now

Stop me now
Push it now, push it now

Stop me now
Push it now, push it now
