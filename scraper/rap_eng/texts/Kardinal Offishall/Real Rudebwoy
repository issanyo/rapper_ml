(Devontée verse 1)
I'm What you looking for right here
Have you come check it off like my Nike airs
Pull up in my whip I'm like high dear
Stick shift baby put it in a high gear
Roll a s****we can hold a vybez here
Ciroc vodka she don't like beer
Gyal a wine but can't compare
You are mine so let them stair

Forget the smoke you get me higher
To much class can't classify her

(Kardinal Verse 2)
She don't want a sweeter thang no no
Downtown garrison no soft comparison
Who gonna take Madison over Maxine and them
Sweet boy business naw she ain't feeling them
Never worked a day in her life negus she screening them
Waste negus feigning , she's bunning them she she's leaving them
Them negus food she cook em them and she's eating them alive
No blige
She ain't seeing what you see in them
I'm the type of rudebwoy same way anyway
Stush ting mi nah business mi drink any day
Take away your girlfriend
Turn out Jenny deh
Nuff chicks pose for the pics we leave plenty deh
Bright red kicks with a yellow shirt
Devontée you know I'll always get the cyattie first
From east to the west you know the ting
We have the whole world a sing

(Chorus)
She don't want a substitute no no no
She in love with a real rudebwoy
She don't want the uptown love no no
And she know I'm the real McCoy

(Devontée verse 3)
Don't cheese me
Believe me
I can get gyal too easy
I'm a rudebwoy I don't need it
I make a stush girl turn around to freaky
Then I have her stuck like she stepped in cement
Wet like sea is
Ain't no body bad like D is
Stimulate her mind make her have ideas
Remove all fears when the rudebwoys here
Cause once you taste my sugar cane I know it's gonna sweet you
Enticed by the rudebwoy I know how to treat you
No respect for substitutes You know you want the teacher
They barely scratch the surface and I know you want it deeper
When it's in your tummy make you hit the gully creeper
Magnum tonic wine is in my body by the litre
Ima sweet wine you and make you a believer
Cause you want that long distance not somebody with a beeper
So kardi I ain't sorry pull up Harley's to your party
Smoking bob Marley with a girl that's acting naughty
And she's start to feel erotic cause I'm feeling on her body
Security uncomfortable and they want to kick me out it
But they do not want no problems cause they know I can get rowdy
And I'm feeling like the hulk I mixed my Henny with hypnotic
Ima lowe it and hold a bubble with this gyal and the way she push up on it she don't want up out it you can tell that

(Chorus)
She don't want a substitute no no no
She in love with a real rudebwoy
She don't want the uptown love no no
And she know I'm the real McCoy
