Eh, where you from Canada?
Everybody on the left
Everybody on the right
In the front and in the back
Let 'em know where you're from

[Hook:]Kardinal Offishall
I'm from the T dot Oh
Rep it everywhere I go
Rep it everywhere I go
Everybody from the cold
Everybody from the cold
This is where we're calling home
This is where we're calling home
I'm from the T dot Oh
Rep it everywhere I go
Rep it everywhere I go
Million people at your door
Million people at your door
This is where we're calling home
This is where we're calling home

[Verse 1:]Kardinal Offishall
I'm from the T Dizzle Oh
Hot with the sizzle flows
Cold when the planes land in the dot oh
Home of the blocko, patois and proper english
Rep it like it's my gang, that's why I sing this
Bleed red and white like a Coca Cola Classic
Some people that I know have their couches in the plastic
Good people got blasted
So we pour a little liquor out and think about 'em while we plastered
Real figures here, never seen and Eskimo
Front in the wrong area, niggas might let it go
Yeah, I love where I'm from all 2.5 million
Sing out

[Hook]

[Verse 2:]Kardinal Offishall
I'm from the depths of Scarborough
One ways of Vaughan Road
Apartments of Flemingdon, shadows in the PO
Every area reppin' the home team
My Italians hold me down, Africans same thing
Portugese get it in, Filipinos rock with me
Nuff Trinis and Yardees holding the block with me
So many faces like we the Winter Olympics
Greatest city ever, after dark you better think quick
Club district, parking lot politicing
We got hotter women than any city admitting
We number 1, check out the figures we gettin
No apologies and never quitting

[Hook]

[Verse 3:]Kardinal Offishall
Regent, Jungle, Vaughan Road, Malvern
Chester Le, Rexdale let the fire burn
If you from Toronto let me see you put a hand up
Born alone die alone, but I'm never on my own
Don't watch no face, stay true is what I was shown
I'm a product of OG's and social workers
3 years of University and Lick's Burgers
Harlem Underground, black owned businesses
Big It Up Hats, and immigrants from long distances
Working class people and some others with some privileges
Any way you look at it we seeing past differences
Yo, I am multiculture
Hand on my ear listening like the Hulkster
And all I'm hearing is we the greatest around
To the grave I'm a rep my town
Yeah
