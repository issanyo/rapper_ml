[Verse 1: Kardinal Offishall]
Black Jays up, within your town
Ray and Neff throw it up so we can get down
Black on Black Blue Jays gone take the crown
Your now in tune to the number one sound
Rudebwoys brown bag their liquor and they walk in the street with it
Rainbow anyting yuh never see me with it
Big matic (CHO!!!) my respect
Automactics, German luger, Kardinal never needed it
Niggas hungry in the streets so we feeded it
Pretty face, ugly body I couldn't be with it
Words from the most high I heeded it
You know it ain't my baby, maybe he did it
His face was in front of knuckle, I bleeded
Niggas dropin dimes AKA they pleadid it
The mic smokin and I proper and bleeded it
You soft pranksta, why you lyin tryin to be gangsta

Rudeboy everybody gone gangsta nigga, gangsta, everybody gone gangsta

[Interlude: Vybz Kartel]
You know this ain't no comedy like Benny Hill
Guns that sings like Lauryn Hill blood spill from now until

[Verse 2: Vybz Kartel]
Lyrically everyone gangsterin, but who wanna take it to the streets, nobody answerin
Bullets to your brain like aspirin, the art of war we did master it
We got arms like George Bush, heart like Bin Laden
Projects and schemes of Jamaican we been trodin
Murder, extortion, kidnappin, bribery, drug money launderin, Alice and Steve keep wonderin
How some pussy can't move we, we shoot like a video or a movie
Bloodbath no, blood jacuzzi
Beretta, calico, uzi, make big man a scream like Susie
We very spooky, our war never marginal, so if a nigga try diss Kardinal
Leave and return like the prodigal
Finish everybody and finish everybody gal, Ha Ha!!!

[Hook: Kardinal Offishall]
Everybody gone gangsta nigga, gangsta, everybody gone gangsta (Gangsta)
