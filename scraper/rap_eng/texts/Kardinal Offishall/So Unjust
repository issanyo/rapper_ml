[Verse 1: Rakim]
Since history it’s been depression and misery
Racism greed deception and bigotry
They make you choose
You a prisoner or a soldier
But once you fall victim to the system
Then you over
(It’s all over)
Thinking you rise on sending lies
It’ll turn your enterprise into genocide
And the powers that be divide and conquer the weak
And the mark of the beast will get carved in the streets
In hell trying to find a heaven
Lost in north America’s hysteria trying to find my brethren
Poisons in the water toxins in the sky spreading
And who’s really responsible for 9/11
One of the biggest conspiracy theories since Christ
While the blind been deprived of the truth since life
Is hard to believe in a world that no one trust
And there’s no one to turn to it’s so unjust

[Hook: Stephen Marley]
Don't bargain for fish
That's still in the waters yeah
The world is so unjust
You don't know who to trust
My brethren
Cause in who yo put your trust
They themselves get barred by the system
