[Verse 1: Eric Turner]
Echoes
Echoes
I'm dominating mazes
Cutting up the charts with lazers
I'm a style changer
Innovater, behaviour changer
Imma let the people know
Imma let the truth be told
Imma chase these haters
Deface these places
And fake pages
Imma lead a search for the gold
Imma let the Rs go
Imma let the shame make em
Call my name and hear my echoes
Imma be the first you're facing
Imma be the last thing, oh
Imma let the shame make em
Call my name and hear my echoes
Echoes
Hear my echoes
Echoes

[Verse 2: Kardinal Offishall]
2 Stripes what up?
Eric Turner what up?
Yeah, style changer, I change wardrobes
For every nigga from the ghetto forced to bust metal
To earn that baby mother money for their Pampers
Hiding that crack in their mouth, starting the campers
Running that street relay without anger
Send it for fresh, you should thank us
Via my reflection, a very urban aspiration
Starting on the world with no explanation
The reason why your son wears his hat
To the side with his arms crossed, emulating bosses
No Rick Ross but the group got the makeup
To make a loser sweet with no lip gloss
Sweeter innovaters, in and out the club with trends
Because the same style don't make ends in my ends
Money makes friends, style makes followers
Style changes change all of us

[Verse 3: Wretch 32]
When I had a peek at you, you were not evolving
I've been getting P cause my echoes with the dolphins
Rappers think they're wavy, end up in the ocean
I'm the rhyme minister, you can do the voting
Radio and TV can't get enough
Guess I'm living in two places at once
Always cried wolf but I never cried enough
I was that kid that was making up stuff
Before when I would shout, no one would listen
Now they're shouting with me while they zone to my riddim
I barely go out with the girls that I've been in
Mrs Wretch is the only loophole to my vision
Off my ex gets depressed when she hears my tunes
I still get the shivers when I see her in the room
And this is no lie, it's a whole lot of truth
If I gave you my heart, I could show you the proof
Ahh yeah, whole lotta echoes man

[Verse 4: Professor Green]
They tell me get a grip, I'm threatened to let go
I don't want a chick, chick, I just wanna get dough
Not that I don't love women but I get loads
I was banging the baddest bitches when I was dead broke
Ugh, you've got swagger like [?]
Move slow, but for the money I'm like U. Bolt
New flow, might have to change on em
Piss on their parade when I rain on em
When your weekends become your weekdays
And you hear so many voices you don't need mates
Not to mention you're nice at rapping, you wanna pass the baton
But you feel like you're on your own running relay
What's left to do but better your whole time?
Ain't nothing to do but better your old rhymes, know that
I hope you appreciate the irony of me saying
That losing ain't part of my vocab

[Bridge: Eric Turner]
Echoes
Make em call my name and hear my echoes
Make make make em call my name and hear my echoes
Make em make em call my name and hear my echoes
Make make make em call my name and hear my echoes
Make make make em call my name and hear my echoes

[Outro: Eric Turner x2]
I don't even know the truth
Relieve me or let me go
No cars, no trains nor air travel
I'm making up the only code

Style changer
Style changer
Style changer
Style changer
