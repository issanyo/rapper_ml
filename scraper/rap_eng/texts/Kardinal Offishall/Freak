This is something that I love, listen I'm about to teach
Every single girl should embrace their inner freaky freak
Don't be scared, don't be shy, yes you gotta let it be
I can give instructions if ya like to, like to hear me speak

Let me see that leather gear
Kiss him, slap him, pull his hair
Make him yo bitch in here
He wanna see you get down low
He wanna hear you, hear you go
