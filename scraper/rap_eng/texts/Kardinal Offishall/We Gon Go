First Bob died, then James B
Now Mike gone who gonna save me?
All my heroes ground zero, where Jay-Z?
At least he still here, lemme emcee
Lemme emcee I'm gon' go widdit
Red Foxx passed now Bernie Mac
You know a nigga need to laugh where Trixx at?
Russell Peters been the illest since Similac
Arsenio kept the television black
We need take it back, show 'em where the flavors at
Yeah we walk a little funny with the gold grills
Anytime I hear Lauryn I still get chills
Wyclef show front row so ill
They much older but they show you how to get busy
Nike gave a shoe to Dizzee - that's UK
All day with a Semtex replay
Westwood in the hood 279
Google these niggas international prime time
Y'all rappers like welfare part-time
Eventually you stop workin for the shine
I murder every line right in front of police
Old school keep the fridge full of O.E
As a dedication to the DRE
I'm a be a Nigga With an Attitude, no degree
Lemme emcee, lemme emcee
1st Rap City, now Vibe gone
And you old heads wonder why the vibe gone
It ain't never been the same since Tribe gone
But you gotta let bygones be bygones
I'm gone pissin' on your lawn
Fertilize the game, my drive I pass on
Raised on tge stage, rock for the public
Live for my wife and my fam you gotta love it
Wine on a gyal when the dub start rubbin
I'll take a house party over clubbin' any day
Stupid Ã©coute that's why you never learn nothing
I make more than enough to get by
Enuff get high, Ciph keep rockin
Clinton do the thinkin Kardinal do the talkin
Milks on your mustache 1st time nigga
I Sing in the shower I'm a big rhyme nigga
Spit rhyme nigga not tryin to see a cage
Black men turn a new page when you get out
Some don't get let out, if you do go'
Live for respect before you die for the dough
Super Dave thanks for the inspiration yo
Nottz, Jake One, Dready Beats, Just Blaze
Timbaland, Pharell shoutout to Haze
Show respect while they alive that's love
That's peace that hats off to the white glove
