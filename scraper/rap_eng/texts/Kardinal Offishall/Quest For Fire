[Kardinal Offishall]
Yes I see how you are smiling in my face you know what I'm saying
Settin' fire to my back, I see that you know what I mean
I love it though, I love it, you know what I'm saying
My enemies make me stronger, hahahahahahaha

Well I'm on a mission
Van Gogh your ass, so y'all listen
Nigga, there ain't no fire if we don't start the ignition
Throw some bullets at your feet
Show you what ya missing, listen I hope for black love without wishing
I murder the track and go neck to neck without kissing
I'm ducking from the wack flows, calling it dis-missing
Big money in the hook, cats is loot fishing
Nigga's adding ones like they was mathematicians
Four plus y'all equals more without addition, listen
Cooking up plans in a da kitchen
Too many chefs leads to nuff cats bitching
Love in a we face behin' we back yuh teet' kissin
Whether you're garbage or not is not my decision
Before you check it deep, you have to make the incision
Nuff cats are slated for great things
But if yuh nuh lick shot for love
Well den murda we bring
Murdaaaaaaah...

CHORUS [Saukrates & Kardinal]
We see you crab rappers everyday
Praying for a shot to be lead astray
We buss back with the love attack
And add fuel to the fire, fire, fire, fire
We see you crab rappers everyday
Praying for a shot to be lead astray
We buss back with the love attack
And add fuel to the fire, fire
Come and see me nigga!

[Solitair]
I was charged for murdering the track without touching
Filling the track with hot lead without bussin'
No discussion nigga talk without fussing
But F---, I ain't answering another damn question
It's just a matter of telecommunication
Freaking the three bands of frequencies, frequently
I frequently gather frequent flyer miles
I be freaking the same chick that you're admiring
The same G, ask them niggas around me
The P maybe free, but my tracks cost money
I might talk funny, but this nigga is no dummy
Now cough up my dough before I have to call Sunny
Switch switchblades, to switch hand grenades
I switch when a bitch nigga misses my payday
Y'all are concurring, when I'm running in succession
Quick to flow whenever the mic is in session

CHORUS

[Kardinal Offishall]
For crying out loud, you get hard knock detention
Your outside is smiling, but what's your intention
F a judge and stil get an honourable mention
Tell ya peace and love without both my fists clenching
Raps with real flows real re-invention
Chat on wicked tracks, add new dimensions
New cliques, gang bang causing old tensions
Niggas in the streets with swords like street fencing
For these record labels nuff rap cats is Benson
From these old street cats, I took a lesson
Never like groupie hoes hanging in my session
Rolling over weak cats in one succession
Who's up next, we got nuff headz guessing
Brothers feel the heat without Smith or Wesson
Wrote the blue prints nigga, why you testing
The dot when it's obviously us who's best and shit
