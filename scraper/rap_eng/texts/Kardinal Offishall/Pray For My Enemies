[Verse 1: Uptown A.P]
Now I don’t give a fuck who I offend
No longer will I pretend like black music ain't ran by a bunch of old white men
So fuck Reagan, fuck bush and fuck cops
Cause I love jigga,love big,love pac
Riding around on my side of town with my windows down and my music up
Three black folks in my neighborhood and am the youngest one who don’t give a fuck
Still wearing my pants sagging even though they tell me to pull it up
Still repping the VI even though the game don’t wanna fuck wit us
Still fuck with big john
Benny that’s my nigga too
We love them niggas they love us back
Cause they know we gon spit the truth
When we up in the booth
Ever since a little youth
My father always told me son
Fuck with the man who fuck with you
So my island swag
Is why I brag
And my fucking dad
Is why we bad
See we started this island shit
You mean to tell me this the mother fucking thanks we get
(Bullet)

[Hook: Planet VI]
When I pray
To jah jah this is all I say
Give me the wisdom & strength
To defeat all my enemies
An when I call
Out to jah jah this is all I want
Give me the power in the war
To make all of my enemies fall

[Verse 2: Anything Ill]
Am a revolutionary rebel in the flesh
Coming up out of the ghetto. Yes
Fucking hot. Like my lady is the devil in the dress
But the lord is my sheppard
Yes sir
Nigga everything blessed
If you know you can’t take the pressure
Better get your ass another chef
BeCause am cooking crack music
Everybody in the hood riding around
Listening to it
We the new black panthers, fist in the air
Let them do it
Don’t get it fucked up them white boys
Love our music
Fuck the police no fellatio
But I blow them off
Middle finger all in they face
The type of nigga they throw in bars
Malcolm x reincarnated
Please don’t make me go off
Live life
My way
Break all rules
Follow no laws
Free at last
So I'mma die trying my nigga
Its all that I know. Yeah
They don’t like it when we encouraging freedom fighting
We might take over the whole entire world

[Hook]
When I pray
To jah jah this is all I say
Give me the wisdom & strength
To defeat all my enemies
An when I call
Out to jah jah this is all I want
Give me the power in the war
To make all of my enemies fall

[Verse 3: Kardinal Offishall]
Mana man walk in the street like
Fuck yall niggas on
Most of the mon I run with born and raised in the garason
Guns in the belt
But brains in ya head
Loving in the mom
And yelling at they bed
Niggas in the street that will do anything to eat
Except sell out they soul to touch they feet
Naa man wasn’t raised like that
I would rather be in the back poor as fuck
Then rich and fake in front of you
With niggas I bought like nigga wats sup
What it do wag wan ain't nothing am chillin
Took a minute for me to make that million
But am cool when am looking in the mirror though
Don’t let shit pass for the funny though
Tell jimmy iovine he kept my masters
But I kept my gun
Finger in the air busting shots all over everyone
You screaming thug life
Am screaming life of thugs
God over everything you practice that and money comes
Nowadays whatever is clever goes
Some of the best rappers you know was rocking celebrity
If that what it takes to be considered the best rapper out
Fuck rap life am with the six and we be singing out
