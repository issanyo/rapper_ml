Yaow!
I'm gonna speak slow so you can hear every word out my mouth
Trust me 'stead of broken chains, the universe everything counts
My tongue speaks for a generation, no ain't concerned with amounts
I now have influence in places I couldn't pronounce
You're ashamed to cosign ya name to the game that you talking MIND THAT CONVO
(GEAH!!) Keeping it real might mean that you keeping it quiet
Intelligent riot (SHHHHH!)
You ready to die but I ain't lettin you die yet
Live through me fly on autopilot
Watch how I speak live while I'm silent
BIG UP THE ISLANDS!!!
