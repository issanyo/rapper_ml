Let the beat control your body
Let the beat control your body
Let the beat control your body
Let the beat control your body

What, What, What, (x16)
Ayo, You can feel the adrenaline
Fire threw your ventricle
Your bodies unsettled
Gold medal tell the press i am the first one through
Dem niggers running the last lap im untying my shoe

Taking flicks with my fans like britney on coke
Salmonella six watching rappers get yoked
Kon love it when i rap this
It make it easier for anyone on konvict to keep getting paid
We like louie in comparison to guchi from cannal
Like a dark skin amex compared to pay pal
Eh gal turn around see the man im in the back
Eyes low with the custom made blue jays hat
That's my people
Makes these little punks get tight
Laugh hard cause we showing your flaws like black light
I ain't never begged nobody for nothing in my life
Trust me im quick to make a crack smoker my wife

Chorus
Im going in
Going
Going
Going
Im going in
Going
Going
Going
Im going in

Some day i have more neurosis then LD
I curb your enthusiam precisely
New york got me more then Spike lee
Cause i leave nicks on your face if you spite me
Talk i take it lightly, Im the Crocodile hunter
Walker dangerous places Crikey
Who got more checks Stripes or Nike
Whoever it be see me rocking that nightly
The launch pad man take off your nighty
I ain't like turna i keep all my wife beat-er
? got the nine milli-me, Im a big man all these cats are mini mes
Scratch that dey mini thems even with 40 percent of me
They can't drop these gems
Ask me who's my top 10
Imma mention myself, My shadow, My fame and no more men

Im going in
Going
Going
Going
Im going in
Going
Going
Going
Im going in

Eh yo, Our proof is in the whip
One hand on the wheel, One eye on the law
Ten dreams for the steal, I dont need street cred
Im street readily available
Favourable put all your money on the table
Bet what you got and i bet your gonna flop
Cause ain't nobody gon listen to you outside of your block
Im outside of your dot in the benzel taxi
15 stacks dont bother get at me
Tough guy talks seems so passe
Thats french for Fuck off, vocabulary class-ay
Lurks still living in this day
Niggers claim they the shit
I can't see, I'm like charles ray
Ain't nobody coming close to ours
Dont get affend my nigga they just bars
Close your legs girl ? they just ours
Tomorrow they be gone like SARs

Im going in
Going
Going
Going
Im going in
Going
Going
Going
Im going in

Let the beat control your body
Let the beat control your body
Let the beat control your body
