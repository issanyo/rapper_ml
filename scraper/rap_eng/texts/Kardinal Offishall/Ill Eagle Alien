Jesus said to them
?? in his home town
Among his relatives and in his own house
He is a prophet with no ??
He could not do any ?? but just stare
And he was amazed at their lack of faith
People!
Where does a lack of fear come from?

Huh, I want it like hey girl gimme that
Tryin' to milk the game like my label made of Similac
Lyric bunks are similar to semi automatic paperback
Flip through the pages watch bullets givin' you heart attacks
I want the paper stacked, keep my liquidity
Blend out time inna different type of liberty
Family proud of me so I don't need your validity
Tongue change the ecosystem, flood it with humidity
Hot, second guessing me is just stupidity
You don't have no credit much less any credibility
Liar, lie down you're just a liability
Don't need them new friends with unpredictability
Falsing on my business find a piss in your vicinity
Konvict conquering your conscious facility
Watch me prophesize for a piece of the profitability
Doin' this my only disabilititity

I am an alien
I'm an illegal alien
I'm a rude boy with rude boy talk
I'm an alien
Sometimes I feel like an alien
I'm a rude boy that's from T Dot

I approach my life with a certain sensibility
Tell it like it is I don't cover with gentility
Hand full of fam so we move with mobility
Hand full of grands so there is no availability
Livin' with no sin is an impossibility
But don't let the good life cloud your visibility
Lettin' me in the game was an inevitability
Don't follow them cats with no identity
Kardinal steppin' up on your territory
See me civil or wrestle you inside the cemetary
Looking up, don't believe in luck, I believe in love
And you get stung, if you stop me before my time done
Associate of Cannon the son of a big gun
African at heart when I do my bank run
My man Chuck D said my Uzi weighs a ton
Heavy thoughts weigh nothing, each one teach one

I am an alien
I'm an illegal alien
I'm a rude boy with rude boy talk
I'm an alien
Sometimes I feel like an alien
I'm a rude boy that's from T Dot
Huh, dangerous bustin' every hater caught the vapors
I don't watch no face bredren let's get papers
I call it a fade Kobe oh call it a taper
Feelin' like Al Capone goin' on a caper
Never would I harm a girl never even drape her
Let my sister treat her like Chris Rock and shake her
Mayday, mayday, Mr. Morgan break her break her
We get money in an instant like shareholders of Quaker
Just a trouble joiner I am not a trouble maker
From the days of the real sweet love Anita Baker
I'd rather have a real home sittin' on an acre than
Owing about a hundred grand to my jewelry maker
Kardinal call me the immigrant translator
Or the poor people's permanent position vindicator
Kardinal call me the immigrant translator
Or the poor people's permanent position vindicator
Ay

I am an alien
I'm an illegal alien
I'm a rude boy with rude boy talk
I'm an alien
Sometimes I feel like an alien
I'm a rude boy that's from T Dot
