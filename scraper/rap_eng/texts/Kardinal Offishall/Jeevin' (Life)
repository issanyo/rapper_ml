[Intro: Kardinal Offishall]
Life
Life
Life
It's life y'all, life
Word up, life
Uh, can you feel it?
Life
Life, we bring you in the light like this

[Chorus: Jully Black]
Life is so sweet, thank the Lord for my days
Oh, I'm living for today, life might be here went away
Life is so sweet, thank the Lord for my days
Oh, I'm living for today, life might be here went away

[Verse 1: Kardinal Offishall]
Lordy lordy, you took another body
But he didn't cause trouble, didn't bother nobody
He was, just a man trying to rock the mic
But a bullet took his life, aw man
Now my breadren eternally is wearing a dress suit with a shiny shoe
Far stretched from a Gortex don't you think?
I did, now all my man sees is eyelids
Dreams turned into seven, prayers closer to Heaven
Left his baby mother two weeks overdue
Now the two join him, so what side it's truth
Manifiested, because the bless-ed seem to go first
Experience afterlife, the first light since birth
Since we live amoung demons also known as Government
Gangsters... and hookers made to walk the cement
But I (I), Kardinal know the true flow
I have no enemies, but every nigga is a foe
And that's life

[Chorus: Jully Black]
Life is so sweet, thank the Lord for my days
Oh, I'm living for today, life might be here went away
Life is so sweet, thank the Lord for my days
Oh, I'm living for today, life might be here went away

[Verse 2: Kardinal Offishall]
Yo, life is what you do, choices between your crew or your girl
I say f- the both of them and struggle solo
Or so I tend to seek a bend in the road of life, mode of trifeness
As brothers I was running with, dead and walking lifeless
See the niceness is what you should be seeking
When you... on the streets and the madness is peaking
And you... should sit back and recollect
Whether your self worth is in your hard work or a piece of leather
More niggas worship idle Gods and call themselves what they pray to
I sit back and meditate to clear my mind off all external pressure
Sometimes pleasure of the body makes my mental feel lesser
Guilt's a bitch when living for now instead of for the scripture
But your afterlife will catch up with your Mister or misses kisses
When I get you in my will and test the money, I find it funny
Since I'm broke in the soul, my spirit's searching for longevity
Ducking from stray shots is taking the best of me
But I will maintain, success has a stain upon my brain
What you make will remain, and that's life

[Chorus: Jully Black]
Life is so sweet, thank the Lord for my days
Oh, I'm living for today, life might be here went away
Life is so sweet, thank the Lord for my days
Oh, I'm living for today, life might be here went away
Life's so sweet
You gotta thank the Lord for life
You gotta thank the Lord for life

[Verse 3: Kardinal Offishall]
I want to be there to see the eyes of my baby girl
Born into the world of chaos, money, AIDS and violence
Silence breaks my concentration in my private world
Organize, organize so I can flex with my boys
Inside the lance will corrupt, trying to stick you for nothing
Greed, sloth and five others are fillling up my brohters
Word up
Enemy is becoming a part of me and I'm all shooting Glocks is making the block hot
Spots rock, cause niggas realize in between their finger
Thinking buring completes the circle of being a rap singer
The slogan used to be Just Say No, but now just say yo!
And you as high as the sky go
Imagine my mother said turn the other cheek
But nowadays that will get you sprayed on your back you'll lay
If I can't trust you, then unity never will exist
It's the gritty quoted, yes it's just the life in the city
Word life

[Chorus: Jully Black]
Life is so sweet, thank the Lord for my days
Oh, I'm living for today, life might be here went away
Life is so sweet, thank the Lord for my days
Oh, I'm living for today, life might be here went away
