INTRO [Kardinal Offishall]
It's a Kardi Kardi party, what!
What, yeah
Yo this be the Kardi Kardi party, what!
[Saukrates]
Anybody coming through here, gotta expect
The hottest, hottest, hottest hottest
The hottest hottest shit for real
[Kardinal Offishall] {Saukrates}
Yo yo, {you bitch ass niggas}
Yo yo yo, {you bitch ass niggas}
Yo yo yo, {you bitch ass niggas}

[Saukrates]
I ain't spittin', I hock a luggy
This ain't no motherfu---- verse, I write movies
Picture this, how a nigga get sicker than itchy syphilis
Burn radio waves 'til I hit your bitch Christmas list
Ha, I drop rocks like a fifty cent piece from Terror's twenty
Aimed at your Bentley son
Number one when my shard be blast
Mix with hash, made your heart beat fast
[Kardinal Offishall]
Back at your ass in full flash
Come to mash every last class of (emcee)
Pass the baton when I get on
And go on until I got it on
Spark it up and inhale this (emcee)
Masterly, masterfully I be the (emcee)
So many can't rock the mic, so they hold the Glock tight
And I give thanks I wasn't born a sucker
Pucker for this hard fist lyricist
'Nuff butter like BBJ's grocery list
[Saukrates]
Yo, hoes be this hoes be that
Bet if I flash this watch my nigga, that ho be back
And I ain't even rocking a Rolly or fronting with cash
I'm at the bar with George Costanza arguing for tax
The first to let you know, get some flood insurance
It ain't a rare occurrence when I overflow
You'll be backstrokin' from Alaska to Oakland
When me and my Circle be in a yacht... (floating) *echo*

CHORUS [YLook] {Saukrates} (Kardinal)
You know this money man
Got us acting funny man
We sick of living crummy man
We got to get this money man
(New houses), {got, got to get it}
(Real figures by the thousands), {got, got to get it}
(Big stacks for the family), {got, got to get it}
(Big tunes playing annually), {got, got to get it}

[Kardinal Offishall] {Saukrates}
Yo, easy rude bwoy, give me a little second to breeze through
We make the track jump, so it's hard to roll trees to
No matter give me no daps nigga, I ain't trying to please you
Want to flow with me, can't afford the fees duke
Claiming street raps when Jeff Healey could see through
Your wonder bra rah rah, {garbage like bad pot}
Go ahead like punk trick and watch where you land
I'm a shady black slim, you a nigga I can't stand
Move! kid, this some celebrity next shit
Step up and watch the next celebrity hanging by they necklace
Peasants! Think about what you getting into
We hardcore, bump those little fist fights we've been through
We done did it, never mind can or can do
We trying to make it easier for our fam to Land Cruise
You sell the same weed at the same spot
We graduated to the high grade lyrics pon cock
[Saukrates] {Kardinal}
I've been autobahn rhyme ever since primetime
Saw George and Wheezy sipping on fine wine
The ghetto scream {rewind} like daylight savings time
Bring it back, firing legal hollows out the Ac'
{Who's that?} MC's of leisure, Sauk and Kardinal
We bring the ebony stone, now watch me carve it out
Bump my shit in tenement housing
It's a vocal revolution for 2000... "1!"

CHORUS

[KO] Ayo, you better come strapped when we attack
[S] Cause only strapped cats have a shot at the rap
[KO] Bullet holes in the map leave a trail to where we at
But stop short of we
[S] We got them sucking the bowl like they speaking Portuguese
So bitch freeze, your motivation evident
Rhymes milky, chocolate has heaven sent
[KO] Ayo, I'm older now, arguing with back clerks
And presidents and crack heads smoking too close to the residence
What!

[Kardinal Offishall] {Saukrates}
Yo yo, {you bitch ass niggas}
Yo yo yo, {you bitch ass niggas}
Yo yo yo, {you bitch ass niggas}
Yo yo yo, {you bitch ass niggas}

[YLook]
You know this money man
Got us acting funny man
We sick of living crummy man
We got to get this money man

[Kardinal Offishall]
Yo, big Sox, Kardinal Offishall

Let the motherfu---- beat ride

Don't sleep niggas
