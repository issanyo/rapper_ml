[Intro: 50 Cent]
Eeny meany miny moe...

[Hook: 50 Cent (Kardinal Offishall)]
Eeny meany miny moe!

Eeny meany miny moe!
Catch a piggy by the toe
Click-clack, POW! - Officer down! (We still scream: "Fuck The Police! ")

Eeny meany miny moe!
He may holla let 'em go
But nigga if you let 'em go, you get hung by the law
Eeny meany miny moe!

Nigga you confused (CH'EAH!) - let me choose!

[Kardinal Offishall:]
AYO! - One "Licka Officer" walked the earned stripes, (BOOO!)
Two Licka pigs gon' get shot another night. (BOOO!)
Homicide would love for me to take a ride
But I ain't touch pork unless it's dead on the side
With a fork in it, police can suck my third leg! ('ey!)
Lock my niggas up beca' dem look like the dread. (oh, why?)
In the photo that was pointed out by one of your snitches
That worked at mr.Chows in the back doing dishes
That was upset with seein' all them niggas gettin' money
Coming inside the spot, treat the white folks funny
Flashin' all that paper, 30 deep up in the spot
That's why IRS come through to bum that club. (eeee-eeeeeah!)
We ain't waitin' for the boss man to come with no pig
Cause the crew that you deal with spray, (50: YEAH!) they don't say it. Nigga!

[Hook: 50 Cent (Kardinal Offishall)]
Eeny meany miny moe!
.38, .44, .50-cali shotgun, (YEAH!)
I tear up - yo' block, son. (hehe!)
Eeny meany miny moe!
Catch a piggy by the toe
Click-clack, POW! (YEEAH!) - Officer down! (BLAT!)

Eeny meany miny moe!
He may holla let 'em go
But nigga if you let 'em go, you get hung by the law. (EH!)
Eeny meany miny moe!
Eeny meany miny moe! (KARDINAL!)
Nigga you confused - let me choose! (EEEEAA!)

[Kardinal Offishall:]
Hey yo, you took one of ours, now we even in the score
We ain't playin that civil rights thing no more!
No more homies holding hands, we are armin' up for action
The revolution is to the guys like Mike Jackson
No more shootin' niggas 41 times. (NOOOOO!)
No more blastin' us after you sniff lines! (NOOOOO!)
No more sellin' coke to me! Cause when I distribute to you
I get my rights read, pig, FUCK YOU!
WITH A BROOMSTICK! - Who this pig think he is?
Bastard only mean to get spit on by our kids. (CH'EAH, KIDS!)
In the area, cause none of us respect the games
And we already know what provoked all the raids
You sold them guns, now they blastin' you sell the bullets
They shoppin' real heavy like a plane propellor. (blat! blat! blat! blat! blat! blat! blat! blat!)
I ain't sayin' kill nobody B's in blue
Keep it up and you get a park named after you!
