[Verse 1]
It's like I waited my whole life just to come set this off
We in the middle of the game all bets is off
And now we killin' this movin in the best of cloth
And now hard to get girls come extra soft
We need an extra loft for all the people in here
And I be chillin' with the villains like a millionaire
Yo killin each and every city bottle up in the air
Celebratin' how we made it haters get it in the rear (we gone)

[Hook:]

Yo are you really ready, Clear
People I wanna know yo if u really ready, Clear
Tell me if you ready (ready) ready (ready) Clear
Everybody get ready to party get "clear" Clear

[Verse 2]
A yo AK told me I wouldn't recognize the old me
Monetarily speakin' yo the world can't hold me
Fall down givin' high fives to the clouds
Only come down when I'm murdering the crowds
Little niggas talk but I can't hear nothin'
Like "hu." you don't really wanna to push the button cause when you
Push it and we fired up people get wired up
If you don't wanna get tied up then you better stay (stay, stay, stay, stay)

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
My whole crew so fresh, we don't know what to do
R8s in Amsterdam how do u do?
And I'm just startin' with the actin a fool
At Dreamland throwin' big money niggas in the pool
Then I fly to the dot side hang with the hot girls
Put a ring on her turn into a dot girl
Stop girl go ahead with your bad self
Got my city in my heart now we going for delf and gone (gone) gone (gone)

[Hook]
