[Hook] (x4)
Selector turn the beat up
I like the girl dem wonton mi eat up
Body to body look how di skin meet up
My God she make di ting creep up

My God she make di ting creep up!

[Bridge: Kardinal Offishal]
Skamp bust the dance
Wine ya waist put the man dem in a trance
To the left and right like (?)
The girl dem a glance cause they lookin for the bands yo
Skamp bust the dance
Wine ya waist put the man dem in a trance
To the left and right like (?)
The girl dem a glance cause they lookin for the bands

Go! Go! Go! Go!

[Hook]

Body to body look how di skin meet up
My God she make di ting creep up

Selector turn the beat up
I like the girl dem wonton mi eat up
Body to body look how di skin meet up
My God she make di ting creep up

My God she make di ting creep up!

[Verse: Kardinal Offishal]
Yah said she want me eat her
Bun' dat mi na use my tongue for freak her
Bad man nuh go down south just for keep her

Custom made, sometimes in G-Star
Dem boots yeah? Cost a G star
That's why the girl dem move wherever we are
Hold up!
