Light it up, everybody

(Keri Hilson)
The tide is high but I'm holding on
I'm gonna be your numba 1
Numba 1
Nu-u-u-u-u-umba 1

(Kardinal Offishall)
Kardinal!
She's just my part time lover
Pretty little thing
Nothin i would ever think about givin no ring
Nothin but a pretty little overnight fling
Even though she wanna be the queen to my king
She ain't nothin but a work for my ginseng
Someone I would use to buss mi backspring
She woulda be numba one at the badda bing
Bad man nah go badda wid di wife wife ting
She gotta know she's the girl on the side
On the left are the rest numba 2 on my mind
There no way she could be my girl
And she's steady tryin to come into my world

(Keri Hilson)
The tide is high but I'm holding on
I'm gonna be your numba 1
Numba 1
Nu-u-u-u-u-umba 1

(Kardinal Offishall)
Yow, She's just my trophy piece
Mi hot hot gal
Never ever woulda call her Mrs. Offishall
Never ever woulda bring her around my fam
She'd be cryin on the phone but she knows who i am
I'm Mr. Kardinal
Voice to the people
Black J's family and verses are lethal

I dont have time for the play play
She a good chick yo but i'm married to the game
Married to the fame, related to the paper
Tryin to get my name put upon a skyscraper
There's no way she could be my wife
But she's steady tryin to come into my life

(Keri Hilson)
The tide is high but I'm holding on (i ain't going nowhere)
I'm gonna be your numba 1
Numba 1
Nu-u-u-u-u-umba 1

Those other girls ain't nothing like me.(done know Keri)
Just give me the chance and boy you will see that
I'm not the kind of girl who just gets down like that
Oh no
(Kardinal Offishall)
On the real I ain't gonna front
Your the fox to a lotta hound dogs on the hunt
You the push to a lotta cush rolled in the blunt
You the hottest in the dance but you ain't what i want
I'm a business man tryin to get the business
Just tryin to walk out you physical fitness
There's no way you could get that ring
But i hear all the hottie hotties in the place sing

(Keri Hilson)
The tide is high but I'm holding on(the tide is high baby)
I'm gonna be your numba 1 (numba 1)
Numba 1
Nu-u-u-u-u-umba 1
The tide is high but I'm holding on
I'm gonna be your numba 1 (i'm gonna be your)
Numba 1 (numba 1)
Nu-u-u-u-u-umba 1
