[Verse 1: Kardinal Offishall]
Yo, naughty and ready
Come to claim the party
Kardinal and Red-1 are gon' spark the mic
We massive from the West to the East side of Barn(?)
All the weak sounds can't come it
We sing, Oh Lord Mr. Kardinal style nice times twice
Red-1 on the mic device mice times two
Original imperial lyrical manifestations of freshness
Best in these politics called rap music
Abuse it like a pedophile on coke
Eighth wonder of the world, tallest freestyle structure
Flucuate a verb like Misfit
With that on my team I wouldn't risk it
That's the sound of my biscuit
Ready flip it

[Verse 2: Red-1]
Yo, actions speak louder than words, so lets do this
Don't know we business, don't know that we the rudest
The specialist yes we must progress
Gwan express manifest obtain and invest in self-interest
And watch the fly multiply, Red-1 and Kardinal
Yes you must recognize, to this I testify
By the ways of the Samurai
If I fail to make it happen, then I accept to die
Cause, no progress, that is a problem
East vs. West, enough man are dead
Stay penniless, that not work again
Tell you what, we make it happen
Occupied by vibes and not gun clapping
Through rapping, we build foundations
With this brings levels of realization
If somebody got to rule, why can't we be the ones?
Like

[Chorus: Saukrates]
Chic-blow
Deform your structure with no problem
You thought you knew, but I am you times ten
You want some of this and brign your foundation
Seen, come again

[Verse 3: Kardinal Offishall & Red-1]
Knock you out lilke my initials
Evil style like Proctor-Gamble, on your life like Suge Knight
We check them gwan write, we a respect them
Cause, them are our enemy we are dem no friend
When an MC lick hot, let them send them to the West
Make Chemo drop beats 'til them less palm's fist
Pump this a in your Beamer
Yes we be the.. General Official
Pedophiles when it comes to the instrumentals
Combine styles, and commence with crackin'
Conquer the world and Trump girls make it happen
Rascalz in a dis with F-O-S specialist, no stress
Watch how we big up our chest
I'm a hip hop trackster running
Seen the other feet have a better chance of seeing the second coming of Christ the Lord
He's my light and salvation, Mr. Kardinal combine with Red-1
All de come down
Original gun yapper, put down your water gun
Whoever your God is, say your prayer and bye
Cause everybody a fin go, it your turn to die
So why why why?
Why must I be crucify, hey boy stop cry
And identify who's on your side
Cause it ain't the Red-1 or the Kardinal

[Chorus: Saukrates]
Chic-blow
Deform your structure with no problem
You thought you knew, but I am you times ten
You want some of this and brign your foundation
Seen, come again

[Verse 4: Red-1 & Kardinal Offishall]
Ayo, right now
Right and now, if a boy fi test, he gon get licked down
Cause, that's how we like it
It's absolute niceness
They not ???? if they you know you walk straight
Cause a man might debate, and if you really irate
Put in your style bait fate, chosen by the devil
While I reach the higher level, you steaming like a pale kettle
So God sickle, let the big man handle this
Under pressure, the situation's delicate
Ready with the steadiness of a surgeon
We write the version, like the goods of a virgin
Yo, all naughty walk to a pumpkin belly
Jah lead enough niggas trying to buy Pelle Pelle
With no food a in your belly
Crip youth and smelly
But your clothes look crisp
Red-1 the lyricist
And down the Offishall, when a shoot and miss
M-I-C twin clips is what we armed with
I check you a master of Kung-Fu
If you got verbs and nerves to try to dis our crew
Yo might dis you
If you try to run contest with our crew
While we running with the majors
Niggas going gold off their demos
Strength coming from your peeps, while I'm solo like a rolo

[Chorus: Saukrates]
Chic-blow
Deform your structure with no problem
You thought you knew, but I am you times ten
You want some of this and brign your foundation
Seen, come again
Chic-blow
Deform your structure with no problem
You thought you knew, but I am you times ten
You want some of this and brign your foundation
Seen, come again
