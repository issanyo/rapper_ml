[Verse 1: Kardinal Offishal]
Yeah
Kardinal
The black bond with the Canadian I'm in my nah nah
But what tanks suit that war like Vietnam
Murder everything kiss em before you kill em
Though cowards are quick to miss quote I ain't for the ceiling bro
One gun two fingers gun shot, boom
When you thought I wasn't hot, I was still close to six 0′s
Six bros said y'all skip flows and double dot straight to the charts
And I do balls black bond with the microphone
Murder and then bring it back to the life with the high paton
People talking bout what's real hip hop day
He said shit that's real stay dray
I know you scared to say shit
You know they ain't nice nigga scake round the truth I put em on ice
Truth is these niggas so scared to stand up they link up the people they used to this
Man up this kid ran up, crying up the breath
Set the game still need you but ain't nobody left
Just bunch of subliminal disrespect going on
People shaking hands with them niggas they've been shitting on
I said why you think that I wanna be part of that
That's why I chill for a little reflected on rap
It's all Rnb trap enough check
Frank all should more..and most that gun clap
Word up, be yourself stop faking and pretending
Eventually all stories come in ending
Mean faces and lies and all your verses
Whenever a verse could wrath of your God's cursing


[Verse 2: Nas]
I pull a string on the lamp that shit darkens
I'm living in an elegant Moroccan apartment
Proletarian chicks sparking
Convo weak and I don't really care for her jargon
Balcony is windy
Looking at the stars and
I be in the Henny, woozy in the head, wobbling
Gucci pillow on the bed, while she giving noggin
Listening and tripping off the Maxwell album
Thinking I should leave to a European island
Bristol and Spain, bring a book about Stalin
Dinner serenaded with a violin
But shorty not qualified to be took to that kind of outing
Gotta be a fly bitch to hang around that fly shit
Fine dining Olive Garden, naw bitch Nas is
In the real deal, food spots on the constant
Pick the right wine, a Chianti to wash it
Lifestyle encompasses top-notch watches
Rolexes synonymous shit I'm copping
Ask her has she been around duffle bags full of that fuck you cash
Get off the jet with me in heels
I'll cup your ass
Looking in my eyes
Saying Nas you're one lucky bastard
Grip your clutch, you'll get finger fucked in the passenger
I hit the dutch, blow smoke out, music and laughter
See us in the coupe flying past you

[Verse 3: Nas]
Esco, dress code, it changes
Harrod’s in England
Back to the star spangled labels in my closet hanging
Counting wonder in the tundra
Can’t humble the disgruntled when I come through, confront ya
Let nothing slide, sly remarks
You must wanna die but you frontin', why?
When we all know you pumpkin pie
When we in the bus we fly better shit than Emirates
To Dubai, to the Chi
I’m a crucial conflict
Heaven sent, cause a storm, typhoon flood you out
You are what a thug about
I’m a fuckin juggernaut
Never sleep, never tire, keep a freak I tie up
Who don’t speak, she quiet
So I can think, conspire
On my feet’s a ?, and sometimes sneakers
Wear ties at the Setai Miami
Time-pieces are from Zurich
It’s like I’m allergic
To Nonoxynol 9
Give it to you raw so you can feel it
