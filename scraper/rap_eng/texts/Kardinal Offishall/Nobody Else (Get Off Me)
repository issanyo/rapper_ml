Get off me!
Wait a minute. Wait a minute
Get off me!

[Hook]:
Girl when you hit the floor
You just dance that night like there's no one around
You get in your zone
And you just shake it all alone
Like you don't see nobody else

[Verse One]:
Excuse me, I saw you
It's looking like Mission: Impossible
Dancing like nobody ain't there
Nobody ain't lookin' at you freakin' that chair
Nobody ain't seeing what you doing with that tongue
I'm trying to be a good Christian hon
Can I get an amen?
(AMEN!)
Where you at? Be there tomorrow
My life intact yo
But this ain't tabernacle
And that sure ain't holy water
You somebody's daughter
Call me daddy though
Here's my e-mail addy yo
Trying to wind on that body though
But it's like nobody can get close
You wildin', partyin', eyes closed
Hands up, nobody around in your mind
Get yours, I'll hold the line
One time

[Hook]:
Girl when you hit the floor
You just dance that night like there's no one around
You get in your zone
And you just shake it all alone
Like you don't see nobody else

[Verse Two]:
Yo, look what you doin'
My mind is only on (hey now)
Keep bending over, just don't play now
Trying to get you to the room and lay down
Say now, can I dance behind ya?
Hello!
Yo, you hear me talkin'
Don't front like you don't see me standing in front of you
Never mind them niggas humpin' you
I move like Prince, like Mike, like Tito, Jermaine and them
Ever since I could remember
You're looking at an honorary Soul Train member
Yo!
Hey girl
Excuse me
Anybody tell you that you look like Tutti?
Let me show you them Facts Of Life
And stop dancing alone all night

[Hook]:
Girl when you hit the floor
You just dance that night like there's no one around
You get in your zone
And you just shake it all alone
Like you don't see nobody else
