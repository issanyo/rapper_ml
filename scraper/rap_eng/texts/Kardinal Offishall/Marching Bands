[Verse]
It’s funny how I fell into your arms
Thinking if I never left Toronto
I wouldn't be this high
Just a voice in the skies
You changed my life

[Pre-Chorus]
Driving through LA to pass time
Palm trees on the edge of my eyes right now
Hit Venice at the right time
If I didn't meet you I’d die
You and I, we’re meant to be
Our love outlasts history
Our bond is strong

[Chorus 1]
I bet you never knew
We met on Ocean Avenue
Right down in Santa Monica
It’s where our souls first touched
Felt like a thousand marching bands

[Verse 2]
When I saw your face for the first time
When I was without you them were the worst times
That's what I found when I got to know you
Dem gyal nuh like you dem wi haffe (a)llow you
I seem distant at times lemme show you
That it's a defence mechanism that I go through
Only the most high I put before you
I just waan fi love you not control you
You and I were made for each other from the start
Take off the safety aim at the heart
Insecurity may take us apart and I'm
Unsure that there is even a cure for this pure feeling
I be in the clubs it ain't appealing
You are the real and there's something that I think I oughta tell you

[Chorus 2]
I bet you never knew
We met on Ocean Avenue
Right down in Santa Monica
It’s where our souls first touched
Felt like a thousand marching bands

Played through the bedding of the sand
Right down in Santa Monica
It’s where our souls first touched

[Bridge]
You and I we shout out loud
“This is the best day”
Into the best night
To the best time we ever had
It all just came to my head
When you laughed at me and said
“This is the best day”
Into the best night
To the best time we ever had

[Chorus 2]
I bet you never knew
We met on Ocean Avenue
Right down in Santa Monica
It’s where our souls first touched
Felt like a thousand marching bands

Played through the bedding of the sand
Right down in Santa Monica
It’s where our souls first touched
