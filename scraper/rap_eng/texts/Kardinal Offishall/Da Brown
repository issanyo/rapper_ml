[Intro]
Yo yo, this is me
(what's going on Kardinal?)
Yo, here the other day I was walking on the E-W right
(uh huh)
A crew man come up to me
(yo)
Talking, talking the... you know what I mean
(yo, niggas can't front on the uptown nigga)
Yo, you know how, you know you know you know the deal, you know what I mean
(Of course I know the deal, it's the E-W son)
Yo, check it out, you I can tell them, you know what I'm saying
(What you say?)
Yo yo yo, check it out yo

[Verse 1]
Yo niggas be crazy to pass me, last seed to see me
Saw me before he was his rap dream die with all of his team
Yo F.O.S. niggas scheme on how to infiltrate a milly stock
Mooch or cream silly, go for delf
What you like how we go back to Cali, kick a suede walking billy
Hoes like big Willy in their Pelle Pelle Pelle
Fonzarelli, I burn niggas
Roll with the do anything to earn niggas
You learn niggas, F.O.S. don't pull triggers
We pull out a stack and pay a nigga to make you die quicker
Rolling in Sauk's Acura
Dial the cellular, to the G-man
Contemplate D-plan, make everything swing
None of the Circle will sing a song sweet to the po-po
It's a vision in four or four straight because nobody know where you go
Try breakfast in a Hugo, large to meet your crew
Your life has left the Earth without a Clue Clue

[Chorus]
Yo my team gets down to da "Brown Brown Brown"
Down to da "Brown Brown Brown"
Down to da "Brown Brown Brown"
Ayo my Circle gets down to da "Brown Brown Brown"
Down to da "Brown Brown Brown"
Down to da "Brown Brown Brown"
Ayo my team gets down to da "Brown Brown Brown"
Down to da "Brown Brown Brown"
Down to da "Brown Brown Brown"
Ayo my team gets down to da "Brown Brown Brown"
Down to da "Brown Brown Brown"
Down to da "Brown Brown Brown"

[Verse 2]
Word, this is for my brother in my Circle (niggas)
F.O.S. Paranormal Circle (niggas)
You pull the trigger, I pull the caps
Flow gas plus the ass, you think it won't go so
Just ask Ro Ro, Lockjaw or Abie, Buck tooth or Mobb
Chiggy Chase or Kay Bee
Who got that Swazy flow, kind of style?
Ask any nigga living, they'll say Offishall
Get files the IRS couldn't capture
Rapture like Anita, prophylactics like Bonita
Bet ya my OSAP, K-A will meet a face within ten days of grace
Deep like bass, watch these rap niggas get all up in your tonsil
With us nigga, you'll be Mourning like Alonzo
Think it won't happen, Offishall don't bluff
Step inside my Circle and we'll show how ruff
And it's on

[Chorus]
Yo my team gets down to da "Brown Brown Brown"
Down to da "Brown Brown Brown"
Dat dirty "Brown Brown Brown"
Ayo my Circle gets down to da "Brown Brown Brown"
Down to da "Brown Brown Brown"
Down to da "Brown Brown Brown"
Yo my team gets down to da "Brown Brown Brown"
Down to da "Brown Brown Brown"
Down to da "Brown Brown Brown"
Yo my team gets down to da "Brown Brown Brown"
Down to da "Brown Brown Brown"
Down to da "Brown Brown Brown"

[Verse 3]
Yo, each and every day my crew gets better
You pull a fast one, I'll pull the leather
Interior, inferior, efforts make the next nigga superior
You'll soon see the next contest to get flipped with the quickness
Quickness of the bush makes it easy to push
Feel the inside while I ride it like a yazoo(?) car
Like high school I get high, rub the sternum like Mackie
Reality do or die, you or I is the styli
Try to diamond mind, surely you will be found
In a pine boxes with quilted lining, huh
Shining from the North Star, breaking concentration like the hyman
It's all about timing, rhyming in the cut
Yo what you thinking you proving by your feet not moving
While you play the plaster, me holding up the walls
I be on the dance floor with your girl up on my...

[Chorus]
Yo my team gets down to da "Brown Brown Brown"
Down to da "Brown Brown Brown"
Dat dirty "Brown Brown Brown"
Ayo my Circle gets down to da "Brown Brown Brown"
Down to da "Brown Brown Brown"
Down to da "Brown Brown Brown"
Yo my team gets down to da "Brown Brown Brown"
Down to da "Brown Brown Brown"
Down to da "Brown Brown Brown"
Yo my team gets down to da "Brown Brown Brown"
Down to da "Brown Brown Brown"
Down to da "Brown Brown Brown"

[Outro]
Ayo Offishall get down to "Da Brown Brown Brown"
Down to "Da Brown Brown Brown"
Dat dirty "Brown Brown Brown"
Word up
Know what saying
Dance down to the brown
On the Hill, in the uptown
Ya, this is how we do it now
Yo, for def niggas
Rolling with the Figure niggas
Like so and I'm out, the outro *echoed*
