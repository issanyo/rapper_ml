Our aim: world domination

No fear, hands in-a di air
Bust your gunfinga, wave it like ya don't care
Bust hot lickshots in-a di atmosphere
There's a party to rock, that's why the Rascalz are here
No fear, hands in-a di air
Bust your gunfinga, wave it like ya don't care
Bust hot lickshots in-a di atmosphere
There's a party to rock, that's why the Rascalz are here

So lick shots and bust yo caps
Put it up, where yo gunfingas at?
Lick shots and bust yo caps
Put it up, where yo gunfingas at?

[VERSE 1: Red 1]
Aiyo, gunfinga the tool, against the grain, no rule
Plow! Shots a-bust and we notorious
Thus thrust, Red'll defend the rugged and raw
(Cause we a-rudeboy) So hit em with the hardcore stuff
Cause when Glock's not enuff, sometimes a man fi get cuffed
Handled ruff, reminded we dangerous
Ain't no messin with nobody less they fuck with us
Cause we keep to ourselves and the pounds we puff
So let it burn, rockin the chalice, take turns
Red 1 not concerned, I got em a-fi learn
Bout respect due, yo respect a-fi earn
Big up to Rascal Crew, foundation stand firm
Fear none, think that we done, we just a-come
Gunfinga cocked in a-di air, make it bom
Bo! That's for my ghetto people
Cause the world's unfair, never was equal
Chick a-bo! That's for Babylon pon patrol
Cause Van City cats got tons of hydro
And there's one more that we gotta let go
And that's the one that we lick off in a-di po-po
I test the empire, then we royal gumbo
Many guns for hire when your regime crumble
Then raise my gunfinga in the air, bom again
Wave it like a flag, world domination pon dem

No fear, hands in-a di air
Bust your gunfinga, wave it like ya don't care
Bust hot lickshots in-a di atmosphere
There's a party to rock, that's why the Red 1 is here
No fear, hands in-a di air
Bust your gunfinga, wave it like ya don't care
Bust hot lickshots in-a di atmosphere
There's a party to rock, that's why the Kardi is here

[VERSE 2: Kardinal Offishall]
Let em see your gunfinga, but hold your gun down, please
Yo, don't bust no shots, so me and my niggas could rock
Dem call me Mr. Kardinal (Dem call me Mr. Red 1)
Come follow me, holler me out if you know what I'm talkin about
My niggas walkin about, big up the ghetto veterans
Street presidents, slum residents
And all my niggas on they two feet with street sense
And more than two cents in-a dem pocket
I rock a verse for kicks, run my lyrics in-a di mix
I bet he love it, respect, big up your chest
Kardinal and Rascalz gwan make you feel hi-i-igh
Killin you softly with no lye
While your toe taps I'm breakin your back over my hi-hat
Kick drum is makin you numb, snare snap is strapped
To bust back for every red-eyed nigga on the attack
So when I'm comin through you cannot stop me on the go
For every nigga that clack-clacks, the Figure IV gotta be gold
Like that

Lick shots, bust yo caps
Put it up, where yo gunfingas at?
Lick shots, bust yo caps
Put it up, where yo gunfingas at?

[VERSE 3: Red 1]
Aiyo, the big gun spark, light up the dark (Yes, mire)
360 degrees, the place on fire
Feel the heat, yo, either surrender or retreat
Cause Kemo don't give a fuck, he put some fire in the beat
Gave me the trigger to watch me blow them off they feet
(Plow! Bust your gunfinga, cause respect compete)
The all Massive Van Crew, soldier men, too
Yo rudeboys in-a di dance, dedicated to you
And all the young guns up, they past they curfew
(Big up di sexy gal crew, cause dem bust shots too)
Skettels and virgins just to make a debut
Keep di clip in-a di g-string, ready to move
So what you do is put your hand in-a di air
And you bust your gunfinga, wave it like ya don't care
I swear, one love to my people out there
You we salute, lickin off shots in the air

No fear, hands in-a di air
Bust your gunfinga, wave it like ya don't care
Bust hot lickshots in-a di atmosphere
There's a party to rock, that's why the ( ? ) are here
No fear, hands in-a di air
Bust your gunfinga, wave it like ya don't care
Bust hot lickshots in-a di atmosphere
There's a party to rock, so Figure IV is there
