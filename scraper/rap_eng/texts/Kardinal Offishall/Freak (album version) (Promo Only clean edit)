This is something that I love, listen, I'm about to teach
Every single girl should embrace their inner freaky freak
Don't be scared, don't be shy, yes, you gotta let it be
I can give instructions if you like to, like to hear me speak

Let me see those handcuffs off
Let me see that leather gear
Kiss him, slap him, pull his hair
Make him your bitch in here

He wanna see you get down low
He wanna hear you, hear you go
I can be a freak
Every day of every week

(Okay)
Superman lover
I'll pitch your tent with a XL M.agnum under cover

She know the deal
Ass look better in a 9 inch heel
One left in my room like Cinderella
Hand full of chicks, no better get ill

Freak to the bone even if your mom home
I'm beatin' still
Killed them chicks when I see you in the club
Better write your will

Approach with caution
Careful how you handle my drill
Yeah
And we freakin' still

Ha, yes, they tell you so fly
Right down, right down to the shoes
Wanna spin these fellas 'round?
Ladies, this is how you do

Whip your hair, do your smile
Tell him this is nothing new
Take it out the box
If he wanna see you in the nude

He wanna see you handcuffed out
He wanna see your leather gear
Kiss me, slap me, pull my hair
He wanna see me smack that there

He wanna see you get down low
He wanna hear you, hear you go
