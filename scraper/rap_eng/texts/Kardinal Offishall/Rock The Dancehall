[Chorus]
Rock the dancehall!
Move ya body y'all!
Rock the dancehall!
It's a party, now!
Rock the dancehall!
Move ya body y'all!
Rock the dancehall!
It's a party, now!
It's a party, now!
It's a party, now!

[Verse 1: J*DaVeY]
I see you with your hands high up in the air
You do ya' fly little thing like you just don't care
And uh, I'm right here
And I'm staring ya' down
Won't you bring yourself 'round here just for awhile
So I can see, see, see
What you got going on
And if it feels real good
Then it can't be wrong
I'm not tryna do bad
But I'm tryna do something, damn!
Don't work me up
If you ain't working nothing, man!
Oh, now you feeling me right?
I think I see you working up an appetite
But don't bite just yet
Keep it all cool
My boyfriend's here
He's a real big dude
And he keeps it ol' school
Like everyday
So give me five more minutes
Then I'll make the escape
'Cause there's a bathroom stall
With our names on the wall
So rock it real hard when you hear me call
Come on

[Chorus]

[Verse 2: Kardinall Offishall]
She moving in stereo
I'd like to put her on my lap
Like three thousand impresarios
A sip of Crown and there we go
Acting a fool
On the dance floor
Back to back, a little Russian Roulette
Turn around and shoot the best game I got
I'm tryna make this shit "Offishall"
That's the name I got
The whole crowd in a frenzy
DJ going off
Yes sir, we about to blast off
Cast off in the corner on a whole new trip
The James Perse shirt covering the tattoo on her hip
She told me it says "What you see is what you get"
I'm tryna see what I'm getting while I'm getting it wet
You put your hands up!

And let, let me hear you say
And let, let me hear you say

[Chorus]
