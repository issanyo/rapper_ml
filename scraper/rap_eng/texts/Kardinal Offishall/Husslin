Don't miss the beat
Aiyo my eastside people let me hear yo!
I wanna hear you yes

Aiyo my westside people let me hear yo!
I wanna hear you yes

[Verse 1]
Yo, pass me the keys to the truck so I can start my Husslin'
(Yo we in a rush)
Turn up the speakers so my words shine through
My nigga them street cats will hussle you
YO, we gotta live positive, or positive
Action is your perogative
Clips be sparklin in the parkin lot while time gets dark
We celebratin with the crew
My nigga what else could we do?
Hand to hand passin' contraband
YO, runnin' from Babylon
YO, making the money cause, YO, that's the solution
Yo they won't hire my brothers to work a 9-5
So instead of suicide, we Husslin to stay alive
My peeps dont wanna live off of them government checks
So we take the STREET, we gotta BEAT
And make em move to the BEAT
Your gunfinga in the air, for prisoners on lock
Your gunfinga in the air, for revolution pon cock
Gettin paid out the books this year
We wanna cocoa butter in large amounts (that's cream)

[Chorus]
(Husslin, Husslin.... yo)
Aiyo my people in the streets

[Verse 2]
Can I get a Yeow! (Yeow!)
Aiyo can I get another one Yeow! (Yeow!)
I'm representin' for my hustlers on the go
No chatter, long term doesn't matter baby mama
'Nuff drama she wants her new Guess vest
She's husslin' me to impress
She want child support
But my seed has never ever seen his daddy before
She said if I don't go the loot
She'll take me to court
Tell the police on the side I'm makin' fake passports
Aiyo who's husslin' who?
The politicians or the criminals
Herb hustlers or smugglers, record labels or rap
Yo can I get a soul clap?
Words are infinite
Rhymes are untouchable, in the skies are the limit
Yo, some people husslin' because then can't make rent
They 9-5 makin' them 95 dollas and 10 cents
(Yo people all around the world)
They husslin' to stay alive
When ya hussle do it for the Eye & I

[Chorus]
(Husslin, Husslin.... yo)
Aiyo my people in the streets
(Husslin, Husslin.... yo)
B-Boys from West to East
(Husslin, Husslin.... yo)
The real will never decrease
(Husslin, Husslin.... yo yo yo)
Because we be Husslin Husslin Husslin Husslin.......
You gotta do the Hussle
You and your crew the Hussle
Aiyo we be Husslin Husslin Husslin.....

[Chorus]
(Husslin, Husslin.... yo)
Aiyo my people in the streets
(Husslin, Husslin.... yo)
B-Boys from West to East
(Husslin, Husslin.... yo)
The real will never decrease
(Husslin, Husslin.... yo yo yo)
Because we be Husslin Husslin Husslin Husslin.......
You gotta do the Hussle
You and your crew the Hussle
Aiyo we be Husslin Husslin Husslin.....

[Verse 3]
Yo, well see ya!
Mr. Kardinal rockin' non-stop
Husslin' from uptown and cop a fat drop top
Yo, my Circle bustin' husslin' records from day one
Figure IV to Kneedeep, Capital Hill on the gun
Sliver House And the Girl keepin' the rhythms damn tight
(Tight) Pick up the slack my A.S.R in the back
Yo, the way I bust my hussle
Positive muscle and motion
Husslin' from east to west coastin'
Toastin', the players in the rap game controllin' the dice
You dont have to be a shot caller to show them brothers you're nice
Just do yo thing baby
Straight from up above naturally
And I'm a fan one love
Can I get Yeow! (Yeow!)
Can I get another one yeow (Yeow!)
I'm representin for the T-Dot O (O!)
Aiyo can I get another one, yeow (Yeow!)
Yeow, yeow, yeow
Because we be

Because we be Husslin Husslin Husslin Husslin.......
You gotta do the Hussle
