[Verse 1: Ray J]
I got a question: Who's the baddest girl in the club?
Let me see you raise your hands up, up, up
If you think you're the baddest chick, I wanna get to know ya
I got a question: Who's the baddest bitch on the scene?
Wanna see you dancin' for me
If you think you're the baddest chick, you're the baddest bitch

[Chorus: Ray J]
I wanna know ya, if you're the baddest girl in the club
I wanna see you raise your hands up, up up
If you're the baddest girl in the club, girl in the club (hey!)
I wanna know ya, if you're the baddest bitch on the scene
I wanna see you dancin' for me
If you're the baddest girl in the club, girl in the club

[Post-Chorus: Ray J]
I want a bad girl, bad girl
I, I, I want a bad girl, bad girl
I want a, I want a bad girl, bad girl
I want a, I want a bad girl, bad girl
I want a bad girl

[Verse 2: Kardinal Offishall]
Chick that's nice in the face
She look so bad when walk in' the place
It's good and mean in the back
Everybody lookin' tryna see where we at
'Cause the whole party just (Freeze!) when she walk in
Ain't say a word, but her body talkin'
Tell her, say "Ooh wee!"
Now back to the beat, oh!

[Verse 3: Ray J]
Now this is crazy, she's a perfect ten, she's a dime
Black premium mini dress so fine
I never thought that I'd see so many bad girls in one night
I'm tryna find the one girl who is badder than all the rest
But it's so hard to choose, I confess
If you think you the baddest chick, you're the baddest bitch

[Chorus: Ray J]
I wanna know ya, if you're the baddest girl in the club
I wanna see you raise your hands up, up up
If you're the baddest girl in the club, girl in the club
I wanna know ya, if you're the baddest bitch on the scene
I wanna see you dancing for me
If you're the baddest girl in the club, girl in the club

[Post-Chorus: Ray J]
I want a bad girl, bad girl
I, I, I want a bad girl, bad girl
I want a, I want a bad girl, bad girl
I want a, I want a bad girl, bad girl
I want a bad girl
