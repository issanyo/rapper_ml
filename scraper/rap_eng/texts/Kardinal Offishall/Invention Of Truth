[Intro]
Turn the motherfucking headphones up

[Verse]
This is a revolutionary manage
Me, this beat, and God
I pray hard for two minutes then I'm sinning at large
I close my third eye lid, and hope God don't see me
And what I'm been portraying on TV
We're trying to bring the fire like steeny
But end up at odds with myself, like a clash between bounty and beenie
Some wanna be me
But don't want trade in the insecurities, or the urge to see needy
I get panic attacks flying and coach, like 'if I die now, whats my last words spoke'
Is my mother gonna break down?
Does my wife have enough paper stash, for the government shakedown?
Governments break down, but men are not allowed
If you show emotions, it's tears of a clown
I'm not in agreement, half the niggas incapable of expressing love and leave blood on the semen
I see men, and all of us socially born mores
I see who they're and I see what they tell Torres
I see where they live, and I see what they make public
I moved out the ghetto, but I'm never above it
My salvation is what I'd covet, but I live selfish
Just me and my empress
Alone in my mind it's an emotional tempest
Good and evil seem to coexist in every sentence
Looking at the screen, seeing people, that was not my bin
Till I pray and realize is not my bin
I'm not one of them
I want greater success, but I can't stomach to be around none of them
So I travel with lesser of two evils, unadvised what I do, business with my peoples
It's hard to separate checks from friendships
When friends don't see checks, they want you to end quick
That's how you separate friends from associates
Both are still capable of acting inappropriate
I've seen friends talk more shit than enemies
I'm probably guilty of doing it in my past
So I ask, for forgiveness if you feel that I've hurt you
But don't disrespect my virtue
I'm trying to be a man, but I still have some actions of an adolescent
Lion-heart, but I'm a symbol with antidepressants
I'm antidepressant
I'm praying, I'm learning my lesson
Session to session. I'm trying to usher my confessions
I never made my life public before this
And I can see the publicists ready to haul this

[Outro]
The truth heavy, that's why most can't carry her, God spoke through me and I carried her
The truth heavy, that's why most can't carry her, God spoke through me and I carried them
Truth
