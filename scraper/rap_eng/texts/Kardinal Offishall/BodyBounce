Hey yo 'kon
We keep givin it to them every day my nig
We got another one?
Here we go

Ahhh shit here we go again
I'm lookin' at you but I'm seein' your friends
Both my hands fit around her waist
Her astronauts takin' up my space, yo
I'm about to launch my rocket
Take off your clothes and reach in my pocket
Grab the controller, similar to wii
It's a game and imma let you beat me

(Akon)
Shawty's body's like an hourglass, thats no lie
You know if she bring it to me the cash bout to fly, man
I'm so ready for her, I wanna throw it so fast
But I just wait to show her the blast

(Chorus)
Love the way you make that body bounce
Lovin' how you work it
Love the way you make that body bounce
Lovin' how you work it
Love the way you make that body bounce
Lovin' how you work it
I love the way you make that body bounce
Lovin' how you work it
Work it, work it

(Kardinal)
Bounce, twerk
Show me a little work
Imma take them calories off with that shirt
Look how you bouncin'
All of the sudden I think how many men try to climb that mountain
Them heals you got is no joke, even Akon might go broke
Spendin' them ones, throwin' them twenties
? throwin' up centuries
That's the body of the century
You a little insecure but baby you got plenty
Them stretch marks on your hips is just bungie cords bringin' you back when you dip
I read your lips, my gang stay literate
I ain't scared, not a little bit
Gotta let you know, your worth about a million ?
Now just bounce

(Chorus)
Love the way you make that body bounce
Lovin' how you work it
Love the way you make that body bounce
Lovin' how you work it
Love the way you make that body bounce
Lovin' how you work it
I love the way you make that body bounce
Lovin' how you work it
Work it, work it

Da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da (I wanna see you bounce, I wanna see you bounce)
Da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da (I wanna see you bounce, I wanna see you bounce)

Chyeaa, ?
PS3, the PS stands for PSSS if ya body bouncin' around me
Then it's game over, act like you older
Either we bouncin' right now, or your dirt off the shoulder
So extra, mr. material
Lemme feel on your birthday suit texture
So resilient
I like how on the inside its like a wetsuit, brilliant
Water resistant up to 9 inches
Wrap that let me open it up like Christmas
I'm about the same height as ?
Keep on your heels, lets get down to business
No gym but i'm seein' your fitness
With my eyes closed you pose as a witness
Everywhere the body language you pronounce

(Chorus)
Love the way you make that body bounce
Lovin' how you work it
Love the way you make that body bounce
Lovin' how you work it
Love the way you make that body bounce
Lovin' how you work it
I love the way you make that body bounce
Lovin' how you work it
Work it, work it

(Akon)
Just show me how you do it baby
Just let me see
Thinkin' how you dippin' so amazing in front of me
