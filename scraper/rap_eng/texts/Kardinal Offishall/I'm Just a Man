[Chorus: Allan Rayman]
I'm just a man
Only chaos makes my plate
More chaotic than I am
Simply put, I can't be [?]
No, just a man

[Verse 1: Kardinal Offishall]
Staring at a blue-eyed Jesus
Praying that my envy and my anger decreases
I'm on a journey
Someone tried to convert me and burned me to the bone
I can't escape life when I'm home
Saw my mama cry once and I don't want the deja vu
I wanna be like [?] with a better view
Tryna build a better me, you looking for better you
So I disconnected a little, seeking the better truth
True story, people don't want the scars
But they want the glory
I'm a survivor, every category
Married to the life but the leeches want alimony
Auntie, say a prayer for me, I'm just a man

[Chorus: Allan Rayman]
I'm just a man
Only chaos makes my plate
More chaotic than I am
Simply put, I can't be [?]
No, just a man
Only chaos makes this man
Something more amongst his friends
Simply put, I can't be [?]
No, I'm just a man

[Verse 2: Kardinal Offishall]
Brave thoughts from an old soul broken
I exist in many places where they see me as a token
Doing what I gotta, hoping it's leading me to doing what I want
It's most men's dream to flaunt
We wanna do that stunt but the moves may paralyze
You should see how life look through my pair of eyes
Pair of G's, I'm looking for paradise
Paraphrasing for petty checks, yo I'm an enterprise
See me emphasize empathy
Most them other guys moving, rarely looking back at me
Oh, what a surprise
Proving what I'm worth's like an orphan with family ties, irony
I'm looking to bury my family lies
Life cuts deeper when you feel it in back of you
Fighting feels worse when it's family attacking you
Yo, they judging and making their minds up without asking you
Most of what you hear is not actual, I'm just a man

[Chorus: Allan Rayman]
I'm just a man
Only chaos makes my plate
More chaotic than I am
Simply put, I can't be [?]
No, just a man
Only chaos makes this man
Something more amongst his friends
Simply put, I can't be [?]
No, I'm just a man

[Verse 3: Kardinal Offishall]
Walking with the most high, I'm never alone
Conversations with Jehovah in front of my home
Lord, why they move as bitches and say that they grown?
I'm loyal to them but they still wanna take what I own
I told them I'd share it, it's funny, it's never enough
I told them "I got you," they texting me, calling my bluff
I told them I love them and every thing I do is real
I tell them they talented, they tell me "Give me a deal"
I'm like Tyson fighting for ears
Knowing if they really listen, they'd know what it is
I try to show the most love, they show me their fears
Turning backs when I face them and show them my tears
So I wipe them and I took my heart off of my sleeve
Killing everything around me, never see me grieve
I got the accolades, tell me, what did I achieve?
If even God don't believe, I'm just a man

[Chorus: Allan Rayman]
I'm just a man
Only chaos makes my plate
More chaotic than I am
Simply put, I can't be [?]
No, just a man
Only chaos makes this man
Something more amongst his friends
Simply put, I can't be [?]
No, I'm just a man
Only chaos makes my plate
More chaotic than I am
Simply put, I can't be [?]
No, just a man
Only chaos makes this man
Something more amongst his friends
Simply put, I can't be [?]
I'm just a man
I'm just a man
I'm just a man
