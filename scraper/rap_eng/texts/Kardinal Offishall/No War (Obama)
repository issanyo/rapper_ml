{*Barack Obama victory speech*}
"It's the answer spoken by young and old, rich and poor
Black, white, Hispanic, Asian, Native American..."

[Barrington Levy]
We don't make, we don't make war
If you deal with war, backwards stay far
We're dealing with truths and rights come some more into my sight
Whether you a pimpy or livin right
See all I'm tryna do is just get on with my life
The children are the future, so give them a try...
Whoooooaaaa-aaa!!

We have something for the people!
Busta Rhymes! (ayy!) Barrington Levy!
Mi seh! We have something new ya know!

Stop the senseless killing, trample the war
Hey you people your backs against the walls
The way that we're living we're bound to get a fall
Why can't we get together and tear down the walls?

{Obama}
"...who still wonders if the dream of our founders
Is alive in our time; who still questions the power
Of our democracy, tonight is your answer..."

[Levy]
A know one a we, a know two a we
A know three a we, inna dis ya family AYY!
Touch one a we, then you haffi touch the whole a we (Mr. Levy!)
Inna dis ya family AYY! (Bussa-Bus!)

[Busta Rhymes]
Lemme talk to the people...
See I promise if you violate we coming just to lock off
The barricades of the borough, get your hand chopped off
And probably peel your top off
And pop off the ratchet right in the middle of silence
We don't advocate no violence
But if you're tryna to cross that unforgiving territory once son
And touch my family I will be abducting your loved ones
Like we in the club come, we love to hear the people shout (AHH-WOO!)
It's nothing to tear it down but I'd rather take the peaceful route
Now done with the war, we woulda love it if people screamin it out
You ain't talking about living right, then tell me what are you speaking about
Rhyming and refocused watch the look up on your face-na-na-NA!
And spread a little love, whole heap-a people inna di place-na-na-NA!
See everytime we step in the function we do it proper
It's Busta Rhymes and Barrington Levy, you better call the doctor
We keep it cool but don't forget, you don't wanna spar with us
We're very peaceful but relentless, you don't really want no war with us!

{Obama}
"It's been a long time coming, but tonight
Because of what we did on this day, in this election
At this defining moment, change has come to America..."

[Levy]
A know one a we, a know two a we
A know three a we, inna dis ya family AYY!
Touch one a we, then you haffi touch the whole a we
Inna dis ya family AYY!

[Kardinal Offishall]
Some man dem come fi buss dem gun, shoot dem Glock
But Kardinal come fi bun bad mind, erase that talk
The time is now to recognize what's in the street, what's on the turf
My whole family, told me that I'm king of the Earth
But you earn your royalty, you can't steal or lie for it
If it ain't about my fam I ain't ready to die for it
Money's just a likkle ting, buss for your rights
Police BUSS into my mom's house in the middle of the night
Told me put my hands to the sky, beg for your life
I told em shoot if you want but leave the kids and the wife
As I looked to the floor I saw the nine within reach
But if I do what I'm thinking then who's left to teach?
My people, my community, there's no immunity
War's spreading like the plague, discouraging unity
So I pray through the skylight for Jah Jah to bless
We under stress, but intelligence and "One Love" is how we progress
Yesssss!

{Obama}
"Americans have sent a message to the world
That we have never been just a collection of individuals
Or a collection of red states and blue states;
We are, and always will be, the United States of America..."

[Levy]
A know one a we, a know two a we
A know three a we, inna dis ya family AYY!
Touch one a we, then you haffi touch the whole a we
Inna dis ya family AYY!
Cause We don't make, we don't make war
If you deal with war, backwards stay far
If you deal with truth and rights come some more into my sight
Whether you're black or whether you're white
See all I'm tryna do is get on with my life
The children are the future, so give them a try...
Whoooooaaaa-aaa!!
