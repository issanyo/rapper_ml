[Intro: Kardinal Offishall]
Here we go
Gotta be the big bang
Kardinal offishall
Alongside Miss Rihanna
The queen of the sheets
You know
What it is
Haha
You know what I mean?
Psych but don’t you care

[Verse 1: Kardinall Offishall]
Since Rihanna saw the cheese
Everything’s gone crazy
She took boys on the bump bike
Turn off
They killing the hot ride
But we ain’t saying
We going a mother place
All money gets ho tight
When Kardinal is on the gates
Boo
For girls
Sexy like a baby Beyonce
We saying it’s a ghost
She got platinum for sure
But no easy
Give the girl
Room to refresh
Don’t work this way
Unless she signing a check
Kardinal

[Chorus: Rihanna]
Here we go
Here we go
Let the party begin
Don’t you know?
Turn it up
That song
Baby can’t stop
Won’t stop
Till the break of dawn
Here we go
Here we go
And you know that
We go and rock the show
Set it off tonight
‘Cause the feeling’s right
What you waiting for?
Here we go
Here we go
Here we go
Here we go

[Interlude: Kardinal Offishall]
Don’t you know
This Rihanna
Queen of sheets
Let’s go
She is 2005
Puuuh

[Verse 2: Rihanna]
If you feel me
You got to let me know
Don’t keep it inside
Throw ur hands up
Lemme see ’em now
From side to side
To be this high
Show me what you got
Don’t you ever stop
Till it’s done?
All night long
He get the party on
Till we see the sun

[Chorus: Rihanna]
Here we go
Here we go (here we go)
Let the party begin
Don’t you know? (don’t you know?)
Turn it up
That song
Baby can’t stop
Won’t stop
Till the break of dawn (oh noo)
Here we go
Here we go
And you know
That we go and rock the show
Set it off tonight
‘Cause the feeling’s right
What you waiting for? (what you waiting for?)
Here we go
Here we go
Here we go

[Verse 3: Rihanna]
If you feel me
You got to let me know
Don’t keep it inside (don’t you keep it inside)
Throw ur hands up
Lemme see ’em now
From side to side (from side to side)
To be this high
Show me what you got
Don’t you ever stop
Till it’s done?
All night long
He get the party on
Till we see the sun

[Chorus: Rihanna]
