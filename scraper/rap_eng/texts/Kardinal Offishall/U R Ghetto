Is a whole lot of ones stacked up to make a knot
You know you ghetto when you thinking you a star
And you waiting in line at the back for drinks at the bar
You know you ghetto when think you number one with the flow
And you shoutin out yourself on the radio
You know you ghetto when the polo that you rock
Says "Fruit Of The Loom" on the label and on the top, nigga
You know you ghetto when you stuck inside a jail
Them Jordans on your feet costed more then your bail
You know you ghetto when you going on the creep
And your girl gotta wait for her children to fall asleep

You know you ghetto when your moms part of your crew

You know you ghetto when ya best clothes, is your dress clothes
And your dress is blue jeans and Chinese slippers, knamean?
You know you ghetto when ya askin for cigarettes cause you can't afford hash
Mixed with that weed in your stash

And that cop blockin nigga has got the same damn shirt on
You know you ghetto when you own two cars
And you need ten for me to buy drinks at the bar

And your moms lookin at your crew like they sex toys
You know you ghetto when your brothers paid for jugglin

You know you ghetto when rap is part of your dream
But you can't stay out past 1 cause your mom runs your street team

But your gradpop still on the corner pushin that weed
You know you ghetto when you know you not Jamaican
But your clothes say Tommy Hilfiger nigga you fakin
You know you ghetto when ya like every other brotha
Rappin loud, barkin down the street tryin to be the struggler
