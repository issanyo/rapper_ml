[Intro: Kardinal Offishall]
Buckshot! Kardinal Offishall! Havoc! Yeah!

[Chorus: Buckshot]
Tip that glass up, I got a few bucks
Can't waste time, my mind screwed up
Tip that glass up, don't front now
You know I Got cha Opin you won't ask how
Tip that glass up, I got a few bucks
Can't waste time, my mind screwed up
Tip that glass up, don't front now
You know I Got cha Opin you won't ask how

[Verse One: Buckshot]
Just got a text from the next side of town
From Kardinal, sayin Buck it's goin down (Down)
I replied with a vow, set it off as soon as I touch down
Now, I'm the problem child, my solution I should move crowds
Huh! Tell me how ya like this
Or better yet tell me how I could write this
Tonight miss I'm a get cha opin wide
One step two step we both could slide
Off to the rear or off with your gear
Or off in your ear it's the boss in your ear

[Verse Two: Kardinal Offishall]
Tip glass like how Kardinal tip scales
Fat knot in the socks 'case Buck needs bail
Smirnoff in the system like the Hip Hop
Police takin aim tryin to shut down the game
People takin flicks but we move with the same
Hoodied up in the shadow night life knows my name
Similiar to Batman call me Bruce Wayne
But my wings made of fire, inhale the smoke
No joke easy to provoke Kardi to chill
Those who move in silence harder to kill
I take two sips and recline like Biggie
In the throne, tell Luchino Godfather home

[Chorus: Buckshot]
Tip that glass up, I got a few bucks
Can't waste time, my mind screwed up
Tip that glass up, don't front now
You know I Got cha Opin you won't ask how
Tip that glass up, I got a few bucks
Can't waste time, my mind screwed up
Tip that glass up, don't front now
You know I Got cha Opin you won't ask how

[Bridge: Kardinal Offishall]
Crooklyn to di middle dot O
BDI and Mister Kardi inna stereo
Coppa shot a beat when we on yuh radio
A who a run this see yuh already know
Crooklyn to di middle dot O
BDI and Mister Kardi inna stereo
Coppa shot a beat when we on yuh radio
Oh! Buckshot yuh already know

[Verse Three: Buckshot]
I'm, smooth like a Benz if I'm on new rims
If I swim, no fins, I go in (in)
Shorty's a ten, I'm two of them
So that's a dub, come again
T-Dot, he got these spots on lock
He by the bar, we by the spot
You might see me or might not
It depends if you got friends that want a shot

[Verse Four: Kardinal Offishall]
I woke up in the morning, microphone in my hand
Bottle in the other grip like a Somalia chip
Tryna take all the contents, bad bwoy sense
Before Konvict, I ain't gotta con-vince
To Google me type "Rude Bwoy Karma"
Better than New Jack guy in the {?}
Brothers wit handshakes, cousin wit the llama
Son of a good man, still walk with armor, ya honor

[Chorus: Buckshot]
Tip that glass up, I got a few bucks
Can't waste time, my mind screwed up
Tip that glass up, don't front now
You know I Got cha Opin you won't ask how
Tip that glass up, I got a few bucks
Can't waste time, my mind screwed up
Tip that glass up, don't front now
You know I Got cha Opin you won't ask how

[Outro: Kardinal Offishall]
Crooklyn to di middle dot O
BDI and Mister Kardi inna stereo
Coppa shot a beat when we on yuh radio
A who a run this see yuh already know
Crooklyn to di middle dot O
BDI and Mister Kardi inna stereo
Coppa shot a beat when we on yuh radio
Oh! Buckshot yuh already know

[Buckshot]:
Yeah uh, yup yup, Duck Down, Konvict
T-Dot, BK all day, we do this like...
Killin nonsense, here we go like
Uh, in stereo like, this
Yeah, Buckshot in the ear
Konvict in the ear
Kardinal Offishall like yeah
...Buck..

Bucktown, Boot Camp everyday oh...
Word, word...
