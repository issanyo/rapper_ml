[Verse One]:
I'm from a city where the go getters get that gold quick
And get that gwop and lay both money and the chicks
Nobody has a monopoly over Grindin'
Some people pull the clips out with no rhymin'
They the pushers but I don't have Malice though
They smoke everything without touchin' the chalice though
I tried to give a damn, ain't nobody want it though
So I held on to it and took it personal
I lived around crack dealers and preachers
Street graduates becoming the teachers
Politicians talkin', they couldn't reach us
So we becoming the six o'clock features
Don't study me
You won't graduate
But my life's good money, you can't tabulate
Get that doe, but hold your head high
A piece ain't enough we deserving the whole pie

[Hook] [Shi Wisdom]:
Dear Mr. Parker you made me this monster
Cause what don't kill me makes me strong
And I decide where I belong
Dear Ms. Mahalia, got something to tell ya
If they never made you, they can never break you
Just remain the real truth, you decide your fate
Go on

[Verse Two]:
If you can't take the heat, then why you got your hand out?
In Hell's Kitchen, the regular never stand out
In high school they told me I wouldn't be nothin'
Wouldn't make it out the turf, wouldn't see nothin'
They saw my gang and made up they mind quick
But I would never let the evil in their minds stick
Further more, some of the hoodlums I ran with are doctors and lawyers
Trick, I hope you feelin' it
Watchin' us on television with your daughters
Say cheese girl, wave to your father
While his life is Welcome Back Carter
I'm at the ACC with Shawn Carter
Backstage thinkin', "Look at my life now."
I done did good got a house in a white town
Just so that whenever them white folks talk
They gotta respect the rapper who bought the whole block

[Hook] [Shi Wisdom]:
Dear Mr. Parker you made me this monster
Cause what don't kill me makes me strong
And I decide where I belong
Dear Ms. Mahalia, got something to tell ya
If they never made you, they can never break you
Just remain the real truth, you decide your fate
Go on

[Verse Three]:
The teachers got the kids from nine to three
But we got 'em 24/7 in they I.P.O.D
So respect my P.O.V
When I'm fillin' their ears with love, that's on me
See the driver in the fancy car, that's on me
But it is only a fraction of who I be
Never leave my Common Sense like No I.D
What my daddy taught me got me into V.I.P
You see

[Hook] [Shi Wisdom]:
Dear Mr. Parker you made me this monster
Cause what don't kill me makes me strong
And I decide where I belong
Dear Ms. Mahalia, got something to tell ya
If they never made you, they can never break you
Just remain the real truth, you decide your fate
Go on
