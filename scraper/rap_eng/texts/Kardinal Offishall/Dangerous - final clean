Girl I just want it right now don't wanna do no talkin (talkin)
Shortys so right I need to slow down

Freak on it
Good bodyship
When she on the dance floor â€“ tell 'em I rip
When she do her thing man - can't watch shit
That beat soak up everythin our grib
Bad heels like jessica P

Itty bitty waistline moves with the baseline
One look I'll punch 'em, I'm fine!
