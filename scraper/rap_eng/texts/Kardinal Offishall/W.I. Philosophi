[Verse: Miss Raelene]
Fertility
Health
Strength
Guidance
Love
No matter which part you come from
No matter who you think you are
You could be a bad man from uptown
Or a wicked youth from Bermuda
No matter
When it comes to your mother you're soft like over ripe plantin
Those who disrespect their mothers disrespect themselves
You can tell your brethren to *fuck* off
But you can't tell your mother you love her
Boy you're soft
Come now how you so
How you sky larkin so how you sleepin
What happened to you
For you don't find people spend enough time to make sure you grow the right way
You'll find yourself in a jail cell next to all the rest of your friends now go ahead
