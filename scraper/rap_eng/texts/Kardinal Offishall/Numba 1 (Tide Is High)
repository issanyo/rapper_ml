Light it up!
Everybody light it up!
Come Rihanna light it up!

[Hook: Rihanna]
The tide is high but I'm holding on
I'm gonna be your number one
Number one
Number one

[Kardinal]
She just my part time lover, pretty likkle ting
Nothing I would ever think about giving a ring
Nothing but a pretty likkle overnight fling
Even though she wanna be the queen to my king
She ain't nothing but a work for my ginseng
Someone I would use to bust my box spring
She would a number one, not di badda-bing
Bad man nah go badda wid di wife-wife ting
She gotta know she the girl on the side
On the left of the rest, number two on my mind
There's no way she could be my girl
But she steady tryna come into my world, not uh!

[Hook: Rihanna]
The tide is high but I'm holding on
I'm gonna be your number one
Number one
Number one

[Kardinal]
Yo! She's just my trophy piece, mi hot hot gyal
Never ever would I call her Ms. Offishall
Never ever would I bring her around my fam
She be crying on the phone but she knows who I am
Mr. Kardinal - voice of the people
Black Jays family our verses are lethal
I don't have time for the play play
She a good chick yo but I'm married to the game
Married to the fame, related to the paper
Tryna get my name put up on a skyscraper
There's no way she could be my wife
But she's steady tryna come into my life, not uh!

[Hook: Rihanna]
The tide is high but I'm holding on
I'm gonna be your number one
Number one
Number one

[Rihanna]
Those other girls ain't nothing like me
Just give me the chance and boy you will see
That I'm not the kinda girl
Who'll just get down like that
Oh no!

[Kardinal]
On the real, I ain't gonna front ya
The fox to a lot of hound dogs on the hunt
You the push to a lotta kush, rolling a blunt
You the hottest in the dance but you ain't what I want
I'm a business man! Tryna get the business
Just tryna wuk out ya physical fitness
There's no way you could get that ring
But I hear all the hotty-hotties in the place sing

[Hook: Rihanna]
The tide is high but I'm holding on
I'm gonna be your number one
Number one
Number one

The tide is high but I'm holding on
I'm gonna be your number one
Number one
Number one

Light it up!
Everybody light it up!
Come Rihanna light it up!
Kardinal light it up!
