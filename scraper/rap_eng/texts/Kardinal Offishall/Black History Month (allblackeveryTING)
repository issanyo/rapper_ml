[Intro: Caribbean Women]
Right now racism is moving in a different gear, so brothers and sisters you better prepare x3
We are now living in the age of the physiological warfare

[Hook: Kardinal Offishall]
It don't matter if ya' darkskin, fairskin, clearskin, all black
Everyting' is not everyting', when you come from the ghetto where the weed was at
My boy, your boy, his boy, all black
Some of dem' boy try bleach it out, a house nigga is what we call that
All black x6
Everything

[Verse 1: Planet VI]
Aye, I'm a brown skin island boy, who all the darkskin niggas hatin'
If you a chocolate color who dislikes my color then, you still a motherfuckin' racist
Born in the hood, so even black business owners said I ain't shit
And my reply is we are the same skin color just a different slave ship
Ain't really no more black and white, you're either rich or poor as fuck
And if you are broke, it's cool cause that would mean that you are just one of us
Blacks who don't like blacks is the kind of people you ain't suppose to trust
So in they face, I wave my hands with both of my middle fingers up
So even if you have money, Babylon still a treat us the same
Rodney King us today, back then they were hanging us like they do Saddam Hussein
Came from being whipped in chains to now all we want is whips and chains
Ironic and what that says is no matter what some things just won't never change

[Verse 2: Prya]
Yo, if all our leaders are blind where the hell they gon' lead us?
We tell our stories through rhymes and they still don't believe us
They say racism died and got replaced with freedom but they'll still crucify me for praisin' a black Jesus
These girls they'll do anything to change they black features
Brothers don' turned bleaches, mutated to strange creatures
Don-don-don't come up in the night if ya' too light, stay home in the day if ya' too dark
Don't jump in our water if ya' can't swim, ya' might be food for the white sharks

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Kardinal Offishall]
Yo, out of many one people, different colors but trust me we ain't equal
I ain't looking at the white man for the evil, I look some of the most evil you know are your homies
Telling you that you ain't never gonna' make it out the ghetto Hello? see what I'm talkin' bout'
That's physiological warfare is bigger than any nuclear war from the White House
White house, half white President, black house, poison it's elements
Crack house, sell it get a settlement, gentrification making ghettos irrelevant
Anywhere the British went, the lighter you are it is easier to pay rent
That's why enough yawdie's come up far and they try they best to invest in white girlfriends and make pretty pretty pretty little children
Jah walk to ya' people den', they lost but the funny thing is they ain't never went nowhere, they ain't never gonna' get nowhere
It's divide and conquer, multiply
Brainwash fathers, watch them die
Take away they culture they won't cry, as long as they seeing a piece of the American pie
Trading ya' legacy for some Hennessy, giving your respect to the high bidder
I'm in all black till they bury me, even when I'm dead something for you to consider
This ain't about black, white, this here about black oil
This here about colored people, this here about foreign soil
We talkin' about Malcolm X, you sniffin' that Betty White
He sellin' like Taylor Swift cause all them dope heads smoking right
Trying to make that Johnny Cash, sellin' to Bobby Brown
When the revolution comes, we'll see who's around

[Hook]
