[Intro - Pusha T]
Yeah, you think you got the power
You ain't got the power
You don't tell me that it's okay
I tell you that it's okay
You don't got the power
You don't have the power bitch, what
Yo, yo

[Verse 1 - Pusha T]
Everybody freeze, do what I say, do as I please
Commandeer every ship I steer, follow my lead
Y'all runnin' out of time, cause Terror runnin' out of speed
When I slow, blow up, guaranteed makin' you bleed
This ain't about needs, it's all about greed
And showin' niggas who got the power drop to your knees
These bitches errand boys frontin' like they pushin' keys
When I catch 'em, bless 'em, start mama makin' they wreaths
Because I won't stop firin', till I hear that siren
See your blood trickle, or hear your baby cryin'
Sick of niggas lyin', actin' like they tryin'
To be kamikaze, when they scared of dyin'
No alibi, I got the power no one will testify
Take this lead shower and a black flower where you left to die, ooh
Still life is so soothin', it hurts to see you movin'
So I counteract, take a step back and start shootin'
Terror hit a hollow-tooth frame, you and your dame
So when he wind blows, your bodies whistle likes cranes
Call me by celebrity name, I readily aim
And hit you in your chest, now your shirt readily stained
If there's one I didn't gun down, believe he'll be run down
Because I'm killin' every nigga from, sun up to sun down
Finish them, all adversaries diminishin'
And I'll flee the country before I plead guilty or innocent

[Hook]
You don't have the power
You don't tell me it's okay, I tell you that it's okay
You don't have the power
When I say down, nigga lay down, nigga stay
You don't have the power
You don't tell me it's okay, I tell you that it's okay
You don't have the power
When I say down, nigga lay down, nigga stay

[Verse 2 - Malice]
So y'all think that y'all can run with us
Nigga, is your ones big enough, comin' in the sums big enough
When it's time to go to war, is your guns big enough?
Or are you minor league, shit, I call your bluff
You got tough talk, but your walk, feminine
We startin' out wit' full clips, then empty 'em
From a pair of still Siamese twins, that cripple men
We can handle this like outlaws to gentlemen
And I die for the love of the dough's my sentiment
But for now, we be invading your block and tenements
Opposite end of a Glock gun, power, you ain't got none
Comply wit' every word that I say, your only option
And by full right, send your ass in full flight
Running over niggas like stampedes in bullfights
Power in our relationship, oh so intimate
Our love is limitless, we caress and deep kiss
Money's my only bitch so I get the stash out
Got me whipped on this shit, eat her and lick the ass out
We gon' live like it ain't no tomorrow in this shit
I'm going to wallow in this shit, got her swallowin' my shit
Have wax and flames on her, whips and chains on her
Malice and Terrar, Neptunes, runnin' trains on her
My niggas all blunt it, with stacks and four-hundreds
With no remorse 'cause our money got blood on it

[Hook]

[Bridge]
Listen to my machine gun
Listen to my machine gun, don't try to run
Listen to my machine gun
Listen to my machine gun, don't try to run
Listen to my machine gun
Listen to my machine gun, don't try to run
Listen to my machine gun
Listen to my machine gun, don't try to run

[Hook]
