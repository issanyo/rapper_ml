[Hook]
My Recipe’s My Specialty
Whip Game is sickening, is sickening
How this ‘caine be running through your nostrils like (x4)

I’m on my grind seven days of the week
Gotta get mine, no time to sleep
The life I live does not come cheap
Can’t turn back now cause I’m in too deep
Dot every “I” cross every “T”
Play it to the letter “A” through “Z”
Ain’t learn yet, shame on me
The hustle don’t stop nigga rain nor sleet
Nigga hail nor ice
The re-up charm got my name in lights
Don’t get caught with your hand in the white
Cause this shit here get you jail for life
And I’m in to win, shawty wanna hop inside my Benz
Start talking bout being more than friends, girl save the chat for the BBM
Re up gang we be them
Get it for the low off Mexicans
Anthony G like next of kin
Thought we was done well guess again
Just me and Slim taking a trip around the bend
The coke come back like a second wind
Victory lap, breathe out breathe in
