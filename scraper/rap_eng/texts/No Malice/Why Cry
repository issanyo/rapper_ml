[Verse 1]
I hear em' say dat dat Malice done come along way
From that gas stove where the fire burn like Pompeii
Where the fiend cook it like flamb√©
Mexican connect coppin coka off of mi hombre
That Narcos selling it wit no barcode
Wreaking havoc proportions that only God knows
Nothin like a flip to get rid of dat car note
These bad habits don't pickem up dats bar soap
Out of a dark hole a light shineth from one that once slung rock like a Goliath
Only the Highest can deliver you from Hell's fire
Give you purpose and a head that's held higher
My desire is not bent on that dollar sign
A different cloth cut, I am of that other kind
We all sin but don't be the devil concubine
My message aimed at the kids like it's Columbine

[Chorus]
I heard it's said "Blessed are they who mourn
Weep for a night...Joy comes in the morn
I done lived it to the limit so when I'm gon'
Don't cry for me, cry when a baby born
When a baby born, cry when a baby born
Weep for a night...Joy comes in the morn
This is on behalf of every chain that we adorn
Don't cry for me, cry when a baby born

[Verse 2]
A crying shame all this need to acquire fame
A bad chic w every stitch a designer name
Im on a higher plain still a boss that dont change
Still in that German whip peel off like AufWiedershen
We da the same nah, not even in ya dreamscape
Look younger than I did then I done got a clean slate
Run circles round youngin like it's teen skate
For too long y'all done made the real seem fake
Seem I can't escape, everywhere hearin heresy
I'm Obama, they effin up my legacy
Knowin you a King can't be out here acting beggardly
All I do is trust and doors open SESAME
Allegedly pushed poison to my connects
Bell Biv Devoe except I had better dance steps
One of the many things I get to add to my regrets
Never a dollar would I ever trade for my respect!

[Chorus]
I heard its said "Blessed are they who mourn
Weep for a night...Joy comes in the morn
I done lived it to the limit so when I'm gon'
Don't cry for me, cry when a baby born
When a baby born cry when a baby born
Weep for a night...Joy comes in the morn
This is on behalf of every chain that we adorn
Don't cry for me, cry when a baby born
