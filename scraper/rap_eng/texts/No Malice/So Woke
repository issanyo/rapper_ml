[Verse 1]
Ya either God fearing or God damned
I'm just hear to tell it I ain't givin a got damn
Whether you believe I'm to leave that in God's hands
As fo me I'm ready to die I won't ever a Pac fan
And ain't a Hail Mary that can get you in them gates. Nah!
Ain't no one exempt either not even the greats
Not even elevators are we able to escape
Ya can't  take it wit cha  not even your estate
Ya money no good here!
Treat the Feds like TMZ ain't nothin to see here
I don't confess to police or to the priest
Cause ain't ery' body a saint; fleur Di lis
25 to life for a mere quarter key
Thanks to Tamir I know what you pigs think of me
Silly me for believing my life mattered
Not guilty and that's after we got it on camera

[Chorus]
I'm so woke, I'm so woke
I'm so woke, I'm so woke (what cha talkin bout)
I'm so woke, I'm so woke
I'm so woke, I'm so woke
Is anybody else seeing this?

[Verse 2]
Why must we all suffer for the actions of a few?
Mind of the oppressor playin God pick and choose
Bet Dallas ain't know them kind of chickens came to roost
A tree fall the way it lean that's from Dr. Seuss
Elementary like one and one is two
Maybe next time we might just wanna think before we shoot
I heard it was a killing in Orlando
Media playin our heart strings like a banjo
All lives matter, try tellin that to Philando
I don't think they really care, NOBODY PLAY THE BANJO
Rambo first blood we ain't draw it
Slaughtered right in front of the daughter we all saw it

[Chorus]
I'm so woke, I'm so woke
I'm so woke, I'm so woke (what cha talkin bout)
I'm so woke, I'm so woke
I'm so woke, I'm so woke
Is anybody else seeing this?

[Verse 3]
How you mad now at the President Elect?
Seen one seen em all what the heck did you expect
Superpredator workin on your third arrest
Just to throw away the key how quickly we forget
Lesser of the evils, ain't that a song to sing
Well I voted for the greater just to see the hell it bring
Trump or Rodham either way it's Sodom
Resist or comply, either way they shot em
Dropped him where he stood ain't no second chances
Didn't get a trial let alone his memorandas
Seen it from a child now you can't undo the damage
So even if they Sway the vote you ain't got the answers!

[Chorus]
I'm so woke, I'm so woke
I'm so woke, I'm so woke (what cha talkin bout)
I'm so woke, I'm so woke
I'm so woke, I'm so woke
Is anybody else seeing this?
