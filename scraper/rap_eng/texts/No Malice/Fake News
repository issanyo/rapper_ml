[Verse]
You should of been there when I told em' to keep that lil deal money
Look upon they face was like is he for real?
Real as any them scripture that you can quote
What made it real, fact I had said it when I was broke
I'm Rakim had to tell em I ain't a joke
What it profit man yo gain the world yet lose his soul
Lord knows I am far from innocent
But dare I feed my brothers to the wolves then reap the benefits?
Only for whitey just to hit em with them sentences
Or that white tee just to keep em in remembrance
Remember Prince, told you it's a catch to it
Take my catalog, I just as soon set a match to it
Money like a side chick I ain't that attached to it
Ain't adding up, I done did the math to it
Keep the zeros give it to them weirdos
Even how they dress now, we would never wear those

[Chorus]
How they out here rappin, yet they claim they in the trap a lot?
We don't but it, its fake news
Put em on the big screen since they like to act a lot
We don't buy it, it's fake news
Said you never snitch but we know that you a chatterbox
We don't buy it, it's fake news
One big joke luckily we like to laugh a lot
Ha ha haa!
We don't buy it, it's fake news

[Verse 2]
What happened to the other brother, heard he in the church now
Think he better than us all, he don't even curse now
I ain't in Bible class tuckin my shirt now
I'm running back in that fire like towers had burnt down
Handful of OGs, rest of them turnt clown
Threw his man under the bus you going to jail now
It's cool to tell now even if you perjure
Ain't that the Truth, I'm so Sojourner
Nat Turner, not Timmy I always kept a burner
Seems within these verses they get away with murder
Ya killin me, am I the only one feeling me?
If so I rap to myself like it's a soliloquy
Why this need for alternative facts
At 15 I sold soap as alternative crack
Now I ride to Chilli Peppers and alternative tracks
My my how time fly no turning it back

[Chorus]
How they out here rappin, yet they claim they in the trap a lot?
We don't but it, its fake news
Put em on the big screen since they like to act a lot
We don't buy it, it's fake news
Said you never snitch but we know that you a chatterbox
We don't buy it, it's fake news
One big joke luckily we like to laugh a lot
We don't buy it, it's fake news
