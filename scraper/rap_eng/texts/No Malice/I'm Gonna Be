Yo whats up boo
I know we never had a love like this before
But u know
I wanna be that one for you
Yo tim and bob
Drop that

[Verse 1]
And im not the average guy cuz I
Cherish you and I'm lovin you baby
I'm tellin you to single these guys
Cuz you really got my heart
You better hold onto me tight
It's not a dream it's reality and
If you down you got me for life
Cuz I really love you girl

[Chorus]
I'm gonna be
The one that comes home after work and fix your bath water
I'm gonna be
The kinda guy that'll never do you wrong
I'm gonna be
The kinda guy that ain't flippin out when you with your girls
I'm gonna be
The kinda guy that'll make love through the night

[Verse 2]
Every night I'm treatin you right
Cuz our chemistry is a mystery
To everyone lookin from outside
Cuz they want what we have
When I look right in your eyes
I see your soul and I'm the mate baby
If you down you got me for life
Cuz I really love you girl

Your smile cuts through like a knife
And what you doin for the rest of your life
Cuz I'm thinking of presenting you with a ring
Hope you accept this invitation
Everyday will be a celebration
Birthdays, holidays, could feel the same

[Chorus 2x]
Through the nite (through the nite)
When love feels right
I really love you can't get enough of you
Want you in my life oh girl
You a star and sky so bright
You won't regret it match mate in heaven
Girl whatever you want me to be

[Chorus 2x]
Your smile cuts through like a knife
And what you doin for the rest of your life
Cuz I'm thinking of presenting you with a ring
Hope you accept this invitation
Everyday will be a celebration
Birthdays, holidays, could feel the same

[Chorus 2x]
