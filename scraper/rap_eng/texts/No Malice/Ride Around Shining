[Hook: Pusha T]
All I want to do is ride around shining while I can afford it
Plenty ice on my neck so I don't get nauseous
Float around in the greatest of Porsches
Feel like a chuck wagon cause I'm on twelve horses
And the three behind mine they be the clique
So much ice in they Rollies, the shit don't tick man
Winter through the summer (whaaat) care less what it cost me
While I'm shovelin' the snowman call me frosty lova'

[Verse 1: Pusha T]
This for the 100,000 dollar kitty German drivers
With big rims and low-pro tires
Fuckin' with college bitches with innocent looks like MÃ½a
Corrupt they mind, turn 'em to liars, I groom 'em well
Dior whore, Christian Lacroix
Keep guns stashed under the floorboard
Enough to start world war, paradise in reaches
Home next to beaches, hair pressed, blowin' in the wind
Shit 'bout long as Jesus
Hostilely speaks the Gospel, so match this
Pusha push John P. keys with these sounds of crackness, uh!
The black Martha Stewart, let me show you how to do it
Break down pies to pieces, make cocaine quiches
Money piles high as my nieces
Hefty bags full of cash, cars full of ass
Rolex presidential, bitch, feel the glass

[Hook: Pusha T]

[Verse 2: Ab-Liva]
Chyeah! It's that look that astounds
Life's a circus, I parade the 6 through these clowns
The crown is vacant, I'm takin' the proper steps
I'm takin' them Poppa steps, they prayin' for my downfall
Is it the bling, the king, conquistador
That my jeweler made the face blush on the Franck Muller
The R shape peculiar, it's awesome, layin' over dark skin
Lookin' like arson when I park in the left, it's constant
Minute hand is like Parkinson's
You a fish where the sharks'll swim
In that opaque linen with the odd-colored stitchin'
V12 on the Modena, you can see the pistons
HREs on it, mami see it glisten
When I... (*vroom*) make Oliver Twist like Dickens
It's feelin' like parts is missin', tops don't push soul
Gotta drive it like pole position 'til my soul is risen

[Hook: Pusha T]

[Verse 3: Malice]
Welcome to the world of Rollies, VS diamonds
And that 50,000 dollar show piece, got me shinin'
First nigga holla show me
Let that 9 millimeter turn a fella ghostly
Hell, I'll even grant amnesty to those who owe me
You fuckin' faggot, you need to raise your glass and toast me
Niggas can't figure the format for hustler criteria
Not chrome, chrome rims with stallion insignia
Listen youngin', you've only just begun
"You'll understand when you're older," said father to the son
Who would've thought such riches stem from ill rhymes?
Canary yellow diamonds size of yield signs, slow down
And proceed with caution
Carousel of horses with dual-exhaustion, 'fess up
Youngin', you'll always be next up
Go against I, forever play catch-up, nigga
