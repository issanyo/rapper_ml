[Verse 1: Pusha T]
I be the first one to bust, first one you lust
Experiential flows, that make our souls touch
When it comes to heat, 40-cally chrome clutch
Out the Berlinetta teal-blue and gilded up
Sorry no introduction, I was speedin'
First name Terrar, first half the Clipse that leave you bleeding
Got phony rap cats, be actin' obsurd
Fake hardcore, and really y'all lovebirds
My dogs flip bricks and live in the suburbs
While y'all on the block sweatin' what the next heard
Sick over this, like I had you sippin' on piss
Type thing I do to fake Dons, thinkin' it's Cris
My relations, love hate, my family, love hate
How you hold your heat sideways, expect to shoot straight
My crib ADT nightly, with steel gates
And the only thing that separates us is drug weight

[Hook]
How can hear me out yo, what I'm talking 'bout yo
You don't want to get in this game
The world's my monopoly, with your bitch on top of me
You don't want to get in this game
So roll your dice.. tell me what you got
Is it your ice.. or is it your life
Do what's right.. cause you can't roll twice
Safety's stuck, give a fuck, negotiating with price

[Verse 2: Malice]
Malice, from the Clipse, laser tap with steel tips
Hold like two rubber grips, with snug fit
You know the type, money your wice, money your life
Or either at the club sippin' on Henny and ice
Shit, we plenty nice, own it at any price
Got them hardcore, wannabe thugs callin' on Christ
Yo, I run with common, who be dippin' on they bonds
Man, bullets and slugs, all the above but times ten
It can be love, like hugs and kiss, clubs or fists
Or Malice, good enough your shit like bloods and crips
Twist ya chil-mo, hit the road in double R's
Me and girlfriend, mix drinks and double straws
If you heard, that my dog is strapped, cause they are
Take kinda know face, that sound familiar?
Watch your step, those that slept, they still sleepin'
Left 'em with two in they chest and still leakin'

[Hook]

[Outro: Pusha T]
I tried to tell you
You don't want to get in this game
But you didn't listen
You didn't fuckin' listen, now look at you
Yo, stakes is higher now bitch
Stakes is higher now
Yo, everybody else
Consider yourself warned

[Hook]
