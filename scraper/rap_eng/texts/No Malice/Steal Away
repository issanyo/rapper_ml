[Intro - Pharrell]
It's just that ghetto (*echo*)
Ghetto, ghetto, ghetto
It's just that ghetto (*echo*)
Ghetto, ghetto, ghetto
This ghetto (*echo*)
That ghetto (*echo*)
We still ghetto (*echo*)
That ghetto (*echo*)

[Verse 1 - Pharrell]
I've been thinkin' lately baby
Maybe we should leave here tonight
I've been pushing papers crazy
Even if it's wrong I feel it's right
Maybe we can make sweet love
Girl I know it feel so good
In order to escape this pressure
You know what, we should

[Chorus - Mary J. Blige]
Steal away
Steal away
Leave for a day
We'll never say
We should have, left much more soon
For one night, let's share the moon
Can we make love, all damn day
Let's steal away

[Verse 2 - Mary J. Blige]
You know I really need you, sugar
I want you to make me your wife
I can't wait till we leave out
So we can be together, there's no doubt
That my love, it has no limits
So I will wipe away your frown
Packed all my sexy secrets
Now I'll join you, for the rest our lives

[Chorus]

[Bridge - Mary J. Blige]
We should have left, much more soon
For one night, let's share the moon
Can we make love, all damn day
Now steal away

[Verse 3 - Malice]
For sure ma, I steal away
Car keys to my man's Benz, and peal away
Spillin 'Ze, whether your man like it or not
He ain't diggin' it right, so I'ma be pipin' the lot
I see a hot mami, hold on if you able
We put a flake on your hand, I'll floss your navel
What it costs, I'm able, to make you happy
Whether it's the back of the Four Dot Six (4.6) or the Navi'
Blankets and pillows fluffed up
And we shine like we puffed up, blowin' that 'dro till we fucked up
His luck's up, I just stole his honey
Own his honey, he wilin' like I stole his money
His gold is honeys, my gold is money, he can have my wife
While me and you live that lavish life
With your V. Secret satin tight, thongs and bras
I'm hoping to God this ain't no mirage

[Chorus x2]

[Outro - Pharrell]
It's just that ghetto (*echo*)
Ghetto, ghetto, ghetto
It's just that ghetto (*echo*)
Ghetto, ghetto, ghetto
This ghetto (*echo*)
That ghetto (*echo*)
We still ghetto (*echo*)
That ghetto (*echo*)
This is one of those records
My pops used to listen to ya know
Let's ride, chillin' with the gangsta lean
Mary got the gangsta lean
Come on, the Neptunes got the gangsta lean
