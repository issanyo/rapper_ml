[Intro: Pharrell & Pusha T]
(I know she wants to move it, that girl can't help herself)
(I know she wants to move it, that girl can't help herself)
(I know she wants to move it, that girl can't help herself)
(I know she wants to move it, that girl can't help herself)

[Verse 1: Pusha T]
I keeps that dirty money, I'm talkin' fast cash
I'm talkin' razor shaving, I'm talkin' duffle bags
I'm talkin' You can count it Papi, it's all there
I'm talkin' hooking up that Slumdog Millionaire
I like the fast girls, who like them fast cars
Who rather sell it to ya then ask for more tomorrow
I know those YSL platforms ain't coming cheap
And plus I like to show I gets it from the streets

[Hook: Keri Hilson]
I'm out here dressed like I belong on TV
Settle for less? Hell no, that wouldn't be me
Hey now, all eyes on me, hey now, I skipped the line for free
Bass loud how it's got to be, hey now, all eyes on me

[Verse 2: Malice]
I see your name in lights, your face on the big screen
Let's cruise, drop the top, you deserve to be seen
Rockin' them Prada goggles, you're my next top model
Your style like Jackie O, oh now just sit back and let 'em marvel
I know you see this paper, I bet you count my cash
Countless trips to Saks with her make her tote Birkin bags
[?] nicely served, let that quench your thirst
Damn right those bitches hate cause they just mad you had it first

[Hook]

[Bridge: Keri Hilson]
Jockin' my swag, I'll pop tags, you'll be borrowing
No drinks in here, y'all thirsty, we be swallowing
Don't matter where I go, them haters be following me
So hey now

[Verse 3: Malice]
I know what girls like, know whatchu looking for
Them tights is fittin' right, you hyped them up some more
You pulled that hair back, stick that ass out for them boys to see
You damn near broke your heel from posing, tryna catch a G
Gucci, Fendi, Louis - your man don't do that, do he?
Now take the stage, the floor is yours, come on, let's make a movie
Work that camera mama, rip that runway baby
Now pop your collar, see them dollar signs is why they hate me

[Hook]
