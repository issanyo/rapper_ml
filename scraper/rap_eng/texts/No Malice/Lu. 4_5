[Intro]
“And the devil, taking him up into an high mountain, shewed unto him all the kingdoms of the world in a moment of time. And the devil said unto him, All this power will I give thee, and the glory of them: for that is delivered unto me; and to whomsoever I will I give it. If thou therefore wilt worship me, all shall be thine.”
‭‭My God!

[Verse 1]
Who said being rich ain't what it seem?
I say it's everything you ever dreamed
Hand pickin whores from the mezzanine
My every wish they command, I put that on my wedding ring!
Should a seen dem Vegas nights
At the crap table like I'm shaken loaded dice
Love me for my money, I'm no dummy, yea I know the type
Don't slam my door gettin in, I on't tell em twice
Yeah- dat devil had a hold on him!
Thinkin God had blessed me like I caught a cold on em'
Best friends forever til the stand then he told on em'
Selling Rock together tell me how you Roll on em???
Loyalty's like royalties everybody streamin checks come far and few between
View the scene before you choose to flaunt
Cause he gon give you EVERYTHING YOU WANT!!!!

[Chorus]
It's da dough get anything you want tho it's da power of da dough power of the dough yea yea

[Verse 2]
By no means have I arrived
Wretched man am I tempted on every side
To give you Truth I am thereby obliged
Riches mean nothin if the eye is never satisfied
And I ain't never satisfied guilty as charged I got everything but an alibi
My past life whoo, loved it like a child of mine
Now devil I - spit in yo face like a battle rhyme
Such beauty in the sufferin'
I must look a mess wit all this Blood I'm covered in
Things I done forgot they just now discovering
So when I seen em bask in they fame I was chuckelin' ha!
If only it was funny tho
What a shame too bad it'(s) not like a runny nose
Find em on the Forbes list still having money woes
Posing in that new Wraith, I still want me one of those

[Chorus]
It's da dough get anything you want tho it's da power of da dough power of the dough yea yea
