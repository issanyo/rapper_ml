[Hook: Ishod]
It’s true (so true)
Things ain’t what they used to be (Things ain’t what they used to be)
Everyday life changes
But you need to know
That I still got love for you
(I still got love)

[Verse 1: No Malice]
Now when I say brother, I’m talkin the same mother
We still blood when the fans no longer love us
I had to break apart to honor who is above us
But you should take heart in knowing I got you covered
I see you in the public, now how can I not love it?
We fought for this life and now you making something of it
Well check it little brother, the one thing I discovered
Them riches be where lust in, count em all as rubbish
‘Cus it’s more than evident that these things are perishing
Without them I still see the questions, that Terrence (?)

[Hook: Ishod]
It’s true
Things ain’t what they used to be (Things ain’t what they used to be)
Everyday life changes (Ab-Live I see you)
But you need to know
That I still got love for you (Can not forget Sandman)
(I still got love)
And everything we see
Ain’t what it seems to be
Everyday life changes
But you need to know
That I still got love for you
(I still got love for you)

[Verse 2: No Malice]
And all is well with Pharrell
Star Trak that forever
Promotions from the lord so it was all for the better
The money never made us so how could the money break us
It’s only God who says He would never forsake us
What could ever shake us and even to this day
Our etiquette way tighter than any dame in J
Trust me when I say that my love for you runs deep
I could never be faking, kiss yo mama on her cheek
Anyone can see what you have added to my life
So I must say thanks again bro, this is only right

[Hook: Ishod]

[Verse 3: No Malice]
For every heart broken and every lie spoken
Try not to blame yourself, girl my caine was truly potent
My verses you were quoting while reclining in my coupe
Then I went, scooped up yo friend
How much lower could ones do?
Thinkin it was cute, all the games we were playin in
Please forgive that little boy, he hadn’t any sense
I was dead wrong, Jesus come to my defense!
And have mercy upon my soul when I approach that bench
This pain is too immense, guess it’s time I faced my karma
So reluctantly I pray you meet your knight in shining armor
