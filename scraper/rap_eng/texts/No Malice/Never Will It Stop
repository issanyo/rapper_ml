Never will it stop
The 50 in the duffel won't crush
It settles to the bottom like dust
Fuck what ya heard
You ain't countin' paper like us
A million in the ceiling I can touch

[Verse 1: Pusha-T]
Go-getter, I come from the corner like most niggas
Now from afar, I toast niggas, roast niggas
Anywhere, whichever the coast nigga
Compare me to them 2 ghost niggas - Hail Mary
Heart break when they tales fairy
I kissed that girl and I likes it, like Kate Perry
The tongue-tester, niggas on the corner
Juggle Os for the king, like a jester
Child of a lesser - God, so when I drop the top
It's my way of feeling closer to the Lord
Reaching for the heavens; 'till then, I settle for the 7
30 floors upper room key, at the Western
With her on her back, and her on her knees
My ghetto ass trying to pronounce they dungarees
I say Raph, they say Raf Simon
They think it's real cute while they giving me dome

[Verse 2: Ab-Liva]
Liva. Heh, the cross I bear
So fly in that purple label cloth I wear
No matter the cost, I make Porsche like fear
Every stitch, every seam, when I floss, y'all stare
Ferrari 500 them horse I tear
I circle, I veer, y'all pause like deer
In the headlights, mami play red light, green light
And hop that red torch I steer
There's no law I've feared
Arm glowin' like a roadside flare
King-pin, so the soft I shared
I carried, I huddled, I dared
I muscled, I bled, I sweated, I teared
Got crowned 'n got cheered
You 10 Grand quarter-pound ration
Went 36 flat, that's a asking
Now two-thirds got it for a fraction, a cinder --
Put in the dash in the fender
Dryer sheets, that cover that scent that it renders

[Hook: Pusha T]
Never will it stop
Ever, never, never will it stop
Ever, never, never will it stop
Ever, never, never will it stop
Never will it stop, the 50 in the duffel won't crush
It settles to the bottom like dust
Fuck what ya heard, you ain't countin' paper like us
A million in the ceiling I can touch

[Verse 3: Malice]
And still don't nothing move but the money
Nothing like 50 bricks, wrapped like the Mu-mmy
With the return ensures the Second Coming
So tongue-numbing nigga, you can bet your last
Not a gram off either, you can bet your ass!
I stay with the fifth, since niggas want to grab
Fassst-life, get it y'all is on the fast
And them hoes never say no, 'less they on they rag
Louie bags, I trick 'em with good faith
In hopes they return the favor, with good face
Mentally, my mind in a good place
Wake up e'ery morning admiring landscape --
Hell, even my garage a menage
Like my hoes exotic, same as my cars
Million-dollar deposit, you suffer from withdrawals
I got in the game in the bag like I'm Clause

[Hook]
