[Intro]
Knock-knock
It was the devil and he was comin' for his stuff back

[Hook: No Malice]
Best believe it
Take it from me they coppin' the plea
And I done seen it
She down on her knees fulfillin' your needs
That's that demon, that's the reason
Got them fiendin', best believe it
Best believe it
Take it from me they coppin' the plea
And I done seen it
She down on her knees fulfillin' your needs
That's that demon, that's the reason
Got them fiendin', best believe it

[Verse 1: No Malice]
Lord forgive me but I'm tired of tellin' 'em
Let 'em get they own taste of the medicine
Give 'em all hell for they lack a reverend
Since they can't tell in the room is an elephant
Hella bent to seek, kill, and destroy 'em
Now we all in mourning and pourin' out liquor for 'em
Given every warnin', chosin' to ignore 'em
And it's takin' all I got to not be like "good for 'em"
Good mornin' Vietnam in the ghetto
As the shots rang out from the meadow
And I don't place blame, point fingers, name names
Cause a pot shouldn't talk to a kettle
I was bout the base
All about the base, no treble
I was in the snow, no shovel
I won't live a lie even though I used to try
But I will not side with the devil
Ain't no level that y'all can get with me on
All that blow wasn't enough to ski on
I ain't looked back ever since I was reborn
Now I'm in my two-three Jordan and LeBron
Be warned of the rapture
Don't kill the messenger he just a rapper
No God? Well that's backwards
Without the Father you just a bastard

[Hook: No Malice]
Best believe it
Take it from me they coppin' the plea
And I done seen it
She down on her knees fulfillin' your needs
That's that demon, that's the reason
Got them fiendin', best believe it
Best believe it
Take it from me they coppin' the plea
And I done seen it
She down on her knees fulfillin' your needs
That's that demon, that's the reason
Got them fiendin', best believe it

[Verse 2: MD Uno]
Unquenchable thirst
No intent to replenish the Earth
Sometimes you get what you didn't deserve
Father forgive me for all of the women I've hurt
All of my evil, I'm dealin' with demons
I'm really in need of repentance
I've heard that you can deliver me
You should should deliver me
I've been deliberately inkin' your word
Acknowledge my efforts and all my attempts
To be true to you always and keepin' you first
That's what I'm gon' preach till I'm deep in the hearse
And I'm leavin' the Earth to the sky with the good Lord
Jesus, Jesus, I've been battlin' with demons, believe it
I speak for the meek, and I see for the weak
And I compete with the reaper of death
To give life just for you to live life
Hope you don't think I'm tryna preach you to death
I'm just tryna peep through the flesh
The spirit that I see through the flesh that I eat
So I nibble on the word, got to read to be fed
If it leads to me dead in the streets
I'll be glad to be dead for believing what Jesus had said
When he said it I believed it

[Hook: No Malice]
Best believe it
Take it from me they coppin' the plea
And I done seen it
She down on her knees fulfillin' your needs
That's that demon, that's the reason
Got them fiendin', best believe it
Best believe it
Take it from me they coppin' the plea
And I done seen it
She down on her knees fulfillin' your needs
That's that demon, that's the reason
Got them fiendin', best believe it
