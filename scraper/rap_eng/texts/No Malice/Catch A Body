[Intro:Reconcile]

[?]
Bottom of the map
Trying to catch a body
Why you think I'm in the trap
Pullin' up gettin' it
I've got the block on the line
I got saved and forgiven
It was at the same time
Shooting slugs out the Chevy
Say a Prayer
See em in heaven
It be murder in the street
One-87 (They say)

[Hook: Reconcile]
Imma' catch a body
Imma' catch a body
Ya
Imma' catch a body
That's a body for the body
(Repeat x4)

[Verse 1:Reconcile]
[?]
All through the hood in the summer
I got that heat
That going to make them go harder
They flexing with me
Then they flexing with the Father
[?]
I love all my people the same
I've got hope for my hood
Because they do it again
Pull up on the block
Where are they selling that hard
Homie ain't seen nothing different
He be serving the fiend
I be serving on Jesus
And I pray that it's hitting
And I pray that they getting it
He told me he can't
What
Why is you trippin'
He want to live different
He lacking the vision
My lips going to run dry
My plug gon' stop funding me
Child support
I got all of these felonies
Hey hey hey hey
Homie say living for Jesus is hard
Homie want that soft
All I got is Hard
I can't promise tomorrow
Just know who you need
Died and I rose with the heart of a G
[?]
Trust me I know it was hard for me
I look the same
I don't act the same
Ever since I went under the water
[?]
Lay my life down for the Father
Homie looked at me
Then he Saw the cross
And he said homie rap with me
I pulled him up
I pulled him up
I pulled him up
I pulled him up

[Bridge: Reconcile]
Homie not getting it
Homie not getting it
I got the [?] on the line
[?]
Shooting slugs out the Chevy
Say a prayer
And I've seen them
If he murdered in the street
One day the [?]

[Hook: Reconcile]
Imma' catch a body
Imma' catch a body
Ya
Imma' catch a body
That's a body for the body
(Repeat x4)


[Spoken Conversation: Only in Music Video]

[Reconcile]
Hey bro, you said you was trying to walk this way
You was gonna' walk with Christ

[Other dude]
I mean...I am....It's just not that easy

[Reconcile]
I never told you it was gonna' be easy
Because until you hate it...you just gonna keep doing the same thing
So what's it gonna' take


[Verse 2: No Malice]
Pulling up
Getting in
Like nobody business
God's so good
I gotta' witness
Throwing up praise like it's a sickness
Almost missed it
I was God
Big chain, black skin
Imma' start
Ladies love me
I was Todd
Push that coke like an honest job
Honest to God
We was basking
Counting money
We was laughing
Out the blue
I'm on Damascus
Called by God
He ain't asking
Cuz when that light hit
You in the face
It's like I'ke did
I die for God
I die for God
He die for me
That's priceless

[Hook: Reconcile]
Imma' catch a body
Imma' catch a body
Ya
Imma' catch a body
That's a body for the body
(Repeat x4)
