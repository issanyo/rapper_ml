[Hook: No Malice]
Bowing down to riches, bow down no mo'
Tricking on these misses, bow down no mo'
All these dudes is snitches, bow down no mo'
I'm on top my business, bow down no mo'
Bow down no mo', bow down no mo'
Bow down no mo', bow down no mo'
Bow down no mo', bow down no mo'
Bow down no mo', bow down no mo'

[Verse 1: No Malice]
God bless the child, that God is on
I don’t look to mama, her baby grown
We would ship em' in then we get em' gone
You could smell it on me, like a cheap cologne
He pardoned my wrongs, that’s what the father said
It’s like I had no soul, I was the walking dead
Had to get ahead, ain’t got time to sympathize
I was selling that rock, and if he dies, he dies
So cold blooded but flooded was the bezzle
I was praising god but living like a failure
How could I meddle, all them years I peddled crack
I did it the best, how can I call the kettle black
Big and bad, out here acting like nuttin' phase me
If Tony is arraigned I would cry like a baby
Look at his baby, snot with the ugly face
Listening to some jurors, singing bailiff come take him away

[Hook]

[Verse 2: No Malice]
Those were the days, I remember them well
At the Mariott, laying up with Jezebel
Don’t kiss and tell, this could be our little secret
Telling me she loved me and I believed it
Looking back, oh what a fool I was
Different chick every night, like it was humorous
It fueled my lust but now I hang my head in shame
They got the nerve to ask, did they really hustle caine
Yes indeed, them chickens really flew the coop
Crack the gong with them birds, cock a doodle doo
Them other dudes on the mic, ain't telling you the truth
That’s why I been sick of rap, chicken noodle soup
New recruits better salute, papa don’t play
They got me taking off my belt and hear Sa Da Tay
What'd I say? Fix ya' face and pull up ya' bridges
Save the riddens, one half of the Clipse, no more collisions

[Hook]
