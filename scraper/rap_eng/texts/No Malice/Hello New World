[Intro: Pharrell]
Straight crushing you

[Hook: Pharrell]
Hello new world, here we come on them Twinkie trains
With the hood screaming, "We on our way"
Can't forget where I come from
So I extend my hand to my man, screaming, "I'm on my way!"
Yes, I rap, but best believe, them things still get wrapped
By Papi, screaming, "It's on its way!"
I can't wait for the next nigga from my hood to say
"Look out world, I'm on my way"

[Verse 1: Pusha T]
I listen to the beat and the rhyme is wrote
See, I was 16, eyes full of hope
Bagging up grams at the Hyatt, though
The news called it crack, I called it Diet Coke (Ohhh!)
At the same time, hiding from mama, dodging the drama
Fucking plenty bitches while ducking the baby mama
I found poetry, excuse me, Floetry
"Say yes!" niggas hear the "yuugh!" and they know it's me
Make ‘em sick to their stomach how they s'posed to be
Sipping on a 50 foot yacht, nigga, motion free
Ocean in my backyard where its s'posed to be
Funny how my neighbors don't think its where I'm s'posed to be
They think I'm cuter in jail
But the only time I'm boxed in is when the roof's on the SL
And that even come off, so that would mean I'm visiting
New world, I hope y'all listening, envisioning

[Hook: Pharrell]

[Verse 2: Malice]
This goes out to my A-alikes that hang out on them corners
Who rock Air Nikes, live a hustler's way of life
In white tees, constantly, ducking from Ds
Pumping that D arm readily, waiting to squeeze
Who stay cookin, stay lookin, over they shoulders
Holdin them boulders, tryin to avoid central booking
I ain't coming at ‘cha, quote-unquote "famous rapper"
Who turn positive, try to tell ya how to live
But this information I must pass to the homies
If hustling is a must, be Sosa, not Tony
We can all shine, I want your wrist lit like mine
Neck and ears, I want it lit like mine
Foreign cars, stick shift, six gears like mine
Anything that keep mama from crying, visiting
You from behind that glass, while you away, sentencing
'Cause the judge is saying "Life" like it ain't someone's life

[Hook: Pharrell]
Hello new world, here we come on them Twinkie trains

[Interlude: Grimey]
Yo, what up, what up. This is ya man Grimey from downtown Norfolk. Just want y'all to know it's about time for us to come up and make a change, man. They keep tryin' to keep us down, but that ain't the way to be, man. It's about time for us to get it together, man. Ery'body else put they shit together. Why the niggas can't get together, put they money together? Hustlers come together with hustlers, know what I'm saying? This ain't just for the playas in VA. This for playas all over the world. This is Grimey

[Verse 3: Pusha T]
Times-a-wasting, niggas doin so much hatin
Free ya heart, and show ya greatness
I, like you, had to come from up under the basement
Just like you, had Satan tryin my patience
Still you look at me through jealous eyes
I wish to see all my niggas rise up! Get that money
Put them 9s up, piggy-back out the ghetto ‘for times up!
Niggas rush!
