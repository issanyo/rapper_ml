[Verse 1]
This I beg of thee;
Miss not ye forest for the tree
Melanin of the skin was never to supersede
Or undermine the fact it is He who chose to bleed
I don't do lucky charm rabbit feet or rosaries
'I'm the new Death Row' by myself no reprieve
It's like I can't wait to die for these beliefs
Ooh careful you don't wanna speak death upon ya
Unless the Spirit like a dove has come to rest upon ya!
Fear not but I'm scared for those who hear not
Any and everyone who fall within earshot
Henceforth the proverbial BUCK here stops
At least wit me see I'm all out of tear drops
3 o'clock all types of demonic ish
The spirit cookin bumpin heads wit Abramavic
Never mind a snitch cause here where da problem is
All you drug dealers think you anonymous

[Chorus]
Ya give em Truth but they rather live a lie;
Got me feelin like why I even try?
The Blood's against you!
I only hope to see em' on the other side but if not tell me why I ain't surprised
The Blood's against you!
The truth come for everyone even I
But some things I ain't lettin' slide
The Blood's against you!
Let em run all they want they can't hide
Now all I got to say is Let's Die!

[Verse 2]
Read my lips
When I say hell is forever; won't til I tried to tell niggas gotta do better
That the snake came for my head Donatella
Will of God for my life I can't beat it's acapella
It's all a set up, everything that we idolize
Up to our necks in that all white like a bride
Million dollar deals and still I ain't bat an eye
Makes me the Realest Rapper Alive!
You new guys I understand ya pain
You Went so long without now this world handing you fame
If you don't know cause we ain't teach you all of us to blame
Since they so well dressed let em wear some of this shame
That explain a day & age with no leaders
Had to do it by myself; no features
All I'm sayin is don't die for no sneakers
That's from  remakin album covers w/ no Jesus!

[Chorus]
Ya give em Truth but they rather live a lie;
Got me feelin like why I even try?
The Blood's against you!
I only hope to see em' on the other side but if not tell me why I ain't surprised
The Blood's against you!
The truth come for everyone even I
But some things I ain't lettin'slide
The Blood's against you!
Let em run all they want they can't hide
Now all I got to say is Let's Die!
