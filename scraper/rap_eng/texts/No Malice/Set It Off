[Verse 1: Kardinal Offishall]
I'm tryin not to wear 3X's no more
It's OK Kardinal stand 6'4"
You can hear the insecurity in my voice right
I don't take my chain off on the mic
It's my security piece
It gives me security(security)
I'm waiting for the ghetto to secure me
I just put away thirty percent for my taxes
Twenty for the feds, the rest under my mattress
I gave my wallet a botox injection
A bunch 'a rude boyz in'a your section
Tryna give my tax bracket an erection
A seventies entity girl look at my complexion
If you can smell my cologne you're too close
You small time I net what you made gross
Saturday's everyday when you from around my way
I'm married to the life girl catch the bouquet

[Hook: Kardinal Offishall & (Pusha T)]
Set It Off, Fire Me Up (x4)
(Hold It Down, Yeah That's It) (x4)

[Verse 2: Pusha-T of Clipse]
Pusha, Yeah
Trend setter who pen better than I?
Comin' through in the slim letters that's followed by the fives
Me and my niggas call the coupe Jekyll and Hyde
'Cuz the roof's on and off like they in and out of their minds
Eggshell pale teeter totter on the scale
The 09s is out and I ain't waiting on a deal
So same time the mothafuckers bargaining and lawyering
That coke money just keep pouring in and pouring in
Quarter milli bling-bling, that's the price of fame lame
I should have a title and a deed on the chain man
Re-up Gang; pyrex over pyro
Stir it till it's hard, pop it out, let it dry slow
Recipe for greatness, me and Kardinal nigga taste this
You fucking with the A-list, face it
Nigga this tha' swag, four-eighty-five hangin' off my ass
We call that frivolous cash

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Malice of Clipse]
(Malice)
Superstar like Lupe
See me in the coupe hot damn it's a new day
I remove the roof as if it's a toupee
To shed light on the jewels, Glue on blu-ray
High definition, I get cash
Two-twenty on the dash and the self start ignition
Tola don't love me but she keep insisting
Brain so good it's hard to keep my distance
Red carpet entrance play clothes fashion
Nose in the air I smell the Chanel Platinum
Re-Up is the gang, I rep with a passion
Till the wheels fall off and it all come crashing
Malice with Mr. Kardinal
Behind dark tint like we on the prowl
Nothing like money make a bitch loose her blouse
Well done hommie we rich, take a bow

[Hook]
