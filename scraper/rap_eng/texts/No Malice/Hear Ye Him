[Hook]
Hear Ye Him or hear Him not
You either fear me or fear me not
I know you see clearly, I'm coming for that spot
So, you need to fear me like I fear God
Hear Ye Him or hear Him not
You either fear me or fear me not
I know you see clearly, I'm coming for that spot
So, you need to fear me like I fear God
Hear Ye Him

[Verse 1]
I should've been dead a long time ago
I offered it death, and almost said line I wrote
Camouflaged it and act like I had offered hope
The gold chain was steady hanging, ni**as choked
My older brother was my hero till he started dope
Wish I could've stopped his very first line of coke
But, I don't judge
We all got a guilty pleasure
And bless my mama heart, she still believe he getting better
That's faith and every man was dealt a measure
That's why I believe every word in red letter
I ain't no better cuz' even I supplied em'
For 15 or 20 I provide em'
But, never deny the man that's steady gettin' mad
At every time he begged for cash, I oblige em'
My conscious is speaking kinda loud lately
Lord forgive me, I done killed my mama's baby

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
The Gospel is foolish to those who are perishing
They nod and dose, minus the heroin
The truth's obvious, maybe too evident
But, clearly Malicious is something I should've never been
Here's to the death of him, we gon' say a prayer
I gave ya'll way enough time to prepare
For my second coming
That was the rehearsal
When the real second coming come, there is no reversal
Pusha, I'm the first to admit I want to see ya' win
But, when we die, I wanna know I'm a see you again
And to my baby, I know I hurt you badly
For way lesser, I seen my mama leave my daddy
So, I gladly accept the fact you know I try
I guess that make you the wife, minus the y
I sigh, only cuz' I know the truth
YOLO?? You only live once if you choose to

[Hook]
