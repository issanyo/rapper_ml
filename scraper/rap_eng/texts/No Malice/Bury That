[Verse 1]
In that all too precious blood, I am covered
This is for you, dearly beloved
For every D-boy on the corner
Mason jar in the cupboard
This is for you, dearly beloved
If I could
I would take back every foolish word that I uttered
I owe that to my momma
Knowing how much she suffered
Her first born taken by that 80s holocaust
Then I turned around, served it a la carte
I'm all apart inside
Can't breathe, chokin' on my windpipe
Every time my nephew say he wanna rhyme
And I know he got to question
Why I don't give him my blessing
That's only because I love you like you mine
And I refuse
We lose another
Your father is my brother
Them pipe dreams, let 'em burn
I can't usher
You in this game, knowin' it's a lion's den
I tell you like I tell my own son
Reach higher than

[Hook]
Chasin' that American dream
But life ain't always what it seems
So I had to bury that
Should have known it was a scheme
Any time E (Maserati E) took one for the team
Man, I had to bury that
Half of my homies is in the bing
But y'all don't see behind the scenes
Lord knows, I had to bury that
Out there hustlin' that Medellin
David Banner, all I saw was green

[Verse 2]
They would have you think I am at odds with my sibling
How they look alike, yet bear no resemblance
All hail the Clipse and all of their magnificence
But I cannot deny my deliverance
It is no coincidence
That God choose to use my brethren
To show the magnitude of these ties I'm severing
The fight's fixed, especially ya top 10
Can you trust a list in which Pusha isn't mentioned in?
Really?
Who copped a milli of them kilograms
Broke 'em down, chopped 'em up
Like a ceiling fan
We gave you truth, y'all ain't want it
Y'all wanted spoof
Now I'm Holy Ghost filled like I'm haunted
A warning, it's time to fall before Him on your knees
It seem like everything that's real is what you won't believe
Please, it's time to let go of the past
Of the best duo ever
I guess I am an outcast

[Hook]
