[Hook]
What I've done is unforgettable
My track record's incredible
The way I moved in the trap was so impeccable
It's identity fraud
The way I hear my signature all in your bars
It's so legible
Unforgettable, unforgettable, unforgettable, unforgettable
Let the games begin
As they reminisce over you, my god

[Verse 1]
As I reminisce on what could have been
The choices made, the situations that they put us in
Young world, take heed to these sentiments
Baby girl, don't you give up on your innocence
For that Louis bag or that Michael Kors
I myself included, who don't love a filthy whore?
But why sell yourself short
To hell with this paper and them lines you fell for
Cause we praying on self esteem
And I know your mama taught you better, bitch you a queen
And yes, I did my thing
But them keys can't play forever, nigga you a king
Just try to dig where I'm coming from
A checkered past, but look what has become of him
King me, as I bow down to the King's feet
Lord willing, we gonna come to the light
Now that's a prophecy

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
We all fall short of the glory that is God's
But something about these rappers reek of a facade
We were on the brick road, all the way to Oz
To pull the curtain back just to find it's a mirage
Late model cars, model broads everywhere
Careful where you tread, with every step the Devil's near
Caution beware, for blinded is him
Who calls it a trap yet still enters in
Dancing for ones ain't what I find demeaning
It's having to pick them up, that's dollar's a mean demon
Believe me, I too whored for that money
The best booga sugar, my pimp was a snow bunny
Got every red cent, papa was no dummy
Every chick bad, long hair with no tummy
You should learn from me, I suffered for my wrongs
They nose still running like a marathon

[Hook]
