[Verse 1]
I'm in a race against time my mama dying, I pray she get to see me make it
Cause she love to see the smiles on her babies faces
My younger brother kept her in Mercedes latest
But it was the Holy Ghost that drove her to the Son of David
I was there when mama said, "I believe."
I watched the Jesus steal her heart like a common thief
As for me and my house we gon serve the Lord
I been a fool for far lesser things people murder for
Furthermore He speaks to my intelligence
I find no fault like what's there to rebel against?
Only the Blood can rid you of them skeletons
Chained to a twig forgettin that we elephants
Ever since 15 I seen hella cain
I was in the wind flipping chickens like a weathervane
Beat the Rock to a pulp whoop him good Clubber Lang
Flooded VA like Floyd that's before the Hurricane

[Chorus]
Shame on me shame on me shame on me
At any given time you know I got that thang on me
Quick to to give a hater exactly what he came to see
Had no love for my brothers, shame on me

[Verse 2]
It was all good just a week ago
Jigga in the deck, in the dash a key a coke
Divi at the table, raise a glass then proceed to toast
Pour some for the homies, "If they'd only lived to see it tho."
Here's to the lives that cut short, to women who tuck snort
Through checkpoints stampin they passports
You ain't gotta beg you gon get what ask for
Door blown of the hinge compliments of the task force
It's a rerun like an episode of Power
You can grab em by the cookie introduce em to that powder
All that coke sold like it's somethin we should be proud of
Find yourself in a jam only God can get you out of
Whether Baptist or Catholic, worshippin the baphomet
Every knee gon take a bow take a page from Caepernick
Prophesy' accurate, every jot, every tittle
And we ain't never prayed before now we prayin for acquittals

[Chorus]
Shame on me shame on me shame on me
At any given time you know I got that thang on me
Quick to to give a hater exactly what he came to see
Had no love for my brothers, shame on me
