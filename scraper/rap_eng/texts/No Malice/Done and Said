[Verse 1]
The Good news to the world is that the Son was sent
They flip that and wanna act like it's a punishment
Faith in a President for me there ain't never been
We better all get up on our grind excuse my pun intent
Who don't wanna be rich but to what extent?
The precious Blood got me feeling like the one percent
I must admit many be lookin bass ackwards
I'm in the cut I'M watchin the devil laugh atcha
I ain't exempt, so how can I be mad atcha?
Seems when you try to grow that's when they throw ya past atcha
But I ain't catchin it, I be side steppin it
And I don't owe a soul old friends done left me for dead
With that said, in pain you can find a blessing
Do you need to ask if I believe in Resurrection?
Voila, right before your very eyes
Like you done a ghost you all should be terrified!

[Chorus]
God bless em' God rest em'
Got burdens on ya heart ya need to address em
Got secrets on soul ya betta confess em
Cause when it's all done and said mama gotta dress em'

[Verse 2]
In your soul, empty as you ever was
Rich niggas be rantin just like a parrot does
That mighty $ ain't nothin to be jealous of, I'm just here to give you some guidance, like a parent does
To his child George Michael Father Figure
I truly hope he had Faith, that's a Careless Whisper
Picture hittin em crossroads a lost soul
My heart bleeds for all those who lost hope
Bought rope but suicide's not the answer
U and I blessed there's young kids that got cancer
But we got broads in Atlanta
I do you one better cause I done ran through Savannah
Yea...y'all ain't even sinnin right
Off to Dubai told Misses it's a business flight
My other brothers 'front the judge' facing 10 to life
Cause everything done in the dark is coming to light

[Chorus]
God bless em' God rest em'
Got burdens on ya heart ya need to address em
Got secrets on soul ya betta confess em
Cause when it's all done and said mama gotta dress em'
