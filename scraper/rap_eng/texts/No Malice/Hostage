[Intro: Pharrell, Pusha T & Malice]
Hello?
Yo Pharrell, get the fuck up, get the fuck up right now
Huh?
Yo, it's your day date and we go this nigga tied down, right now
Yo, wait til' I get there
Dawg, you ain't gonna make it out of here bitch
Fuck what you thinkin' nigga?
Hold him up yo, ya'll ready to do this nigga
Why not, I got his ass, I got his ass

[Verse - Malice]
You don't really want none of this though
I let 'em know from the get go
See ya'll is a bit slow
Tryin' come wit the hits but they missed though
Retaliate make 'em drop like a six fo'
Why you hate cause I didn't give a shoutout
Or the way that my shine turn the spot out
You think you can rhyme but you not out
Or the way we drop the top when it's hot out
Anyone you can pick and choose
Why ya'll stagnant, my niggas stick and move
My name say it all, ain't got shit to prove
My whole mental ain't shit to lose
You all niggas snooze if you wanna
But you gonna be a gonna, please forgive me, your honor
But that fool tried to take what's mine
That's the reason I had to utilize my nine
Otherwise, you can be right here now
Talkin' bout how the Clipse don' bit his style (style)
Back in the day how we did him foul (foul)
Or how we don' switched, how you like me now?
And anything else that them haters may say
Come how you want, just bring it the right way
Mayday, what they gon say
Coming to they hood, the Clipse and Tammy

[Hook - Tammy Lucas]
Mother fucker what you here for?
Now you wonder why I gotta the chrome four to your ear for
So you can hear yo (Uncle Terrar you gon let him go?)
I don't know
Count to a hundred wit yo eyes closed
Soon every number is a face of a nigga that's gon die yo
They try to hit me but they too slow (Daddy, you gon' let him go)
I don't know

[Verse - Pusha T]
Are you ready for the showdown?
It won't be pretty if I get another go down
In all aspects, low down
When I hit him, make sure he won't see another go round
What make him think he can flame wit me
Now he hatin' life cause he tried to bang wit me
Had to show him death weren't a thing to me
Nothin more than a mere blood stain to me
It's pain to see, ain't a nigga rank wit me
Better yet, ain't a mother fucker hangin me
Ten more on your side, what your odds gon be
Slim to none cause they all want to run wit me
The nerve to ask, why terrar hold the heat?
Hopelessly, they try to steal my deal just to roast the feat
If I'm the one from being followed
Have my girl double back, mack eleven make m holla
And it's just that easy, one trigger one sque-eze
And he droppin' to his kne-es; damn right, lit him up
Give a fuck about him let the paramedic get him up
I had to muffle his heart beat
Hit everything but the baby in the back in the car seat
Had to show his partner talk cheap
And I'ma draw heat, if a nigga think I wanna walk for heat

[Hook]

[Bridge - Tammy Lucas] (4x)
Think about the things you did
And the things you didn't as a kid
No time to stop cause I'm gonna end your life

[Tammy Lucas - repeat to Hook]
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la

[Hook]
