[Intro]
We been seein' a whole lotta of paper lately, you know, real hustler
You know if the money don't move, I'ma go get it and make that shit move myself, you know
Fly shit, nigga

[Chorus]
Swear all I know I get it, plus I'll never fold
Pops taught me how to flip it a long time ago
Any thing worth sellin', I can get it sold
Any thing worth tellin', I'ma let 'em know
All I know it get it, it keep my blood flowin'
Yeah, if it's about a dollar, you know I'm damn goin'
These niggas don't know about problem til that money come
These niggas don't want no violence, they know how we come

[Verse 1]
Jealousy, envy, and greed, all of 'em
They just sum a nigga don't really need, around 'em
Act like you gone murder me, get found son (uhh)
They like a fish drownin' under the water, shit sound dumb (uhh)
Play dumb, alotta of food on the table, say he great son
They like how a make a million with no education (hey)
I got some niggas locked up, they feel like Akon (heyyy)
Look, aye what's your rap sheet, nigga? (uhh)
You caught a body and you told, they lettin' rat eat, niggas
I get a whole lotta dough, I can feed 10 fat niggas
I got the drop from ya hoe, you could've been wacked nigga (Uhh)

[Chorus]
Swear all I know I get it, plus I'll never fold
Pops taught me how to flip it a long time ago
Any thing worth sellin', I can get it sold
Any thing worth tellin', I'ma let 'em know
All I know it get it, it keep my blood flowin'
Yeah, if it's about a dollar, you know I'm damn goin'
These niggas don't know about problem til that money come
These niggas don't want no violence, they know how we come

[Verse 2]
Aye, what's yo motivation? Seein' niggas in that trap
Seein' ganster toke that strap, seein' my brothers in them shackles (yeah, yeah, heyyy)
I'm tryna put my hood on the map (yeahh)
It's a cold world, but I gotta adapt
Every pistol loaded, my car fully loaded
All these scars but everything was worth it, God didn't make me perfect
I work hard, can't tell me I don't deserve it, I'ma break the surface
Play with the God and we handin' out hearses, to every single person
And that's on my unborn, we took a whole lotta loses but we won some
It ain't a thing in this world that I can't conquer
If anything I'ma legend or king, yeah I'm one of 'em

[Chorus]
Swear all I know I get it, plus I'll never fold
Pops taught me how to flip it a long time ago
Any thing worth sellin', I can get it sold
Any thing worth tellin', I'ma let 'em know
All I know it get it, it keep my blood flowin'
Yeah, if it's about a dollar, you know I'm damn goin'
These niggas don't know about problem til that money come
These niggas don't want no violence, they know how we come
