The game try to play me everyday
But I never pay it no mind
Them hoes try to play me everyday
But I pay it no mind
Pay it no mind, pay it no mind
But I pay it no mind
The game try to play me everyday

[Verse 1: TK Kravitz]
I remember I couldn't even eat
All I wanted was Jordans on my feet
Now I got 'em by the boatload, hella hoes
And I don't even want 'em no more
I wanna get bread
That's the realest shit I said
Niggas always want credit for some shit they didn't do
But fuck that old shit look at what I'm finna do
I strive for perfection, yeah-yeah-yeah
Headin' in the right direction, yeah-yeah-yeah
But this life won't let me, yeah-yeah-yeah
I just hope the Lord cover me, yeah-yeah-yeah

[Hook: Jalon B]
The game try to play me everyday
But I never pay it no mind
Them hoes try to play me everyday
But I pay it no mind
Pay it no mind, pay it no mind
But I pay it no mind
The game try to play me everyday

[Verse 2: YFN Lucci]
How dare you try to betray a nigga?
MVP how the fuck you gonna trade a nigga? Yeah
You know you get what you put in
Never ran on your friend
Don't you hate when a nigga pretend?
Look I remember niggas when I ain't have shit
Scrapin' up my ledger to make a classic
365 days of madness
Hey all this pain turned me to a madman
Yeah, I can't be worried about niggas
I got too much on my mind
I got too much on my plate
And everything only get ate, yeah
Ain't got time to donate
These nigga be full of so much hate
Came in on one cross made

[Hook: Jalon B]
The game try to play me everyday
But I never pay it no mind
Them hoes try to play me everyday
But I pay it no mind
Pay it no mind, pay it no mind
But I pay it no mind
The game try to play me everyday

[Outro: YFN Lucci]
The game try to play me everyday
But I pay it no mind
