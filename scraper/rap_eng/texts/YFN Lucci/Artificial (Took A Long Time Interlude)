[Verse 1]
I stood on that block like an addict
I stood on that block I ain't have it
I stood on that block with my gun cocked
I stood on that block like a savage
I sip codeine with a passion
Nigga play with me we blasting
I squeeze that mic with a passion
I swear it ain't no comparison
I swear I took the fastest, don't open your mouth boy you know what will happen
I got the bank boy you know you ain't havin'
24 hours you know we was trappin'
In the mo cups you know it was Actavis
At your front door we gone get active
Every show goin' up shoutout to Lavish
I got the beamer that's painted so nasty
Them hoes use to ignore
Now they get it off the floor
A hunnit thousand on the floor
Made the bitch get it off the floor
They know not to play with the boy
They know I slang that AK like guitar
They know I'm comin' and ain't no remorse
Apply the pressure when needed
Supply the street then we feed it
We got whatever they need it
I told 'em don't ever deceive me
Always sayin' she gone leave me but I don't need it

[Hook]
Tell me why niggas be actin' like bitches
This shit with prices I'm a differ
I pour champagne on bitches
See I came too far to miss it
I can't be listening to niggas, word to my momma, sister
These niggas be artificial, these bitches be down with 'em
My money talkin' niggas whisperin'
Keep on talkin' they gone miss ya
If they got them drums we got missiles
We got them bombs and them missiles
Either you with us or against us
I dare you niggas go against us

[Verse 2]
Hopped out that matte black Bugatti
They hate but what they gone do bout it
When I'm in the world you the Rarri
I flew my momma to Dubai
See I gott his hoe and she too fly
But I got time to do by her
I got that iron in her lil purse
I keep on lying cause the truth hurt
When we be flyin' you know we in first
Can't wait to land and hop in the vert
We got them bags and we went to work
If you got that cash then you gone get served
If you got that cash you gone get served
Her handbag by Manolo, I had to hide the dope in Leah stroller
I'm tryna get endorsed by the soda
Pull up in the Porsche shit emotive
All my life I been chosen
All my life I been focused
All my rifles been loaded and if a nigga play I'll unload 'em

[Hook]
Tell me why niggas be actin' like bitches
This shit with prices I'm a differ
I pour champagne on bitches
See I came too far to miss it
I can't be listening to niggas, word to my momma, sister
These niggas be artificial, these bitches be down with 'em
My money talkin' niggas whisperin'
Keep on talkin' they gone miss ya
If they got them drums we got missiles
We got them bombs and them missiles
Ethier you with us or against us
I dare you niggas go against us


[Took A Long Time Interlube]

[Verse 1]
Damn, down bad on my dick
I hate when I ain't got shit
Don't you hate when you ain't got shit
Niggas say they got shit but they don't really got shit
Naw I had to make one like this
See i ain't never made one like this
The P.O on my ass hope I ain't gotta piss
If I pay for a job you better not miss
Truth be told so I ain't lie bih
Stood on that block til' I ran out of it
Get this money was my hobby
Gotta keep the carbone 6 by me
All my life I been tryna get it
All my life we tryna get it
They told me get money but sometimes I didn't
Took a long time but I did it
Took a long time
We took a long time
Took a long time but it's fine
Soon the whole world will be mine
