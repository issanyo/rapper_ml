[Chorus: YFN Lucci]
Uh, a boss is one who guarantee we gon' eat
How you gon' tell a boss somethin' he don't know?
How you hold your nuts on a nigga you don't know?
Just know I'm holdin' on that yop and only lord know
Yeah, and never let 'em steal your ambition
Ain't we all thankful that we livin'?
Everybody wanna be the boss, everybody don't listen
As a child I was taught you gotta pay attention, yeah

[Verse 1: YFN Lucci]
Uh, I'm a boss and I ain't gon' act like I don't work, yeah
Swallow my pride, shit I ain't gon' lie, it got me here
Tryna do my best to keep 'em out my ear, yeah
I been workin' all day, all shifts
Look what I became, I couldn't explain how I feel
All that bumpin' your gums gon' make my man come kill
All of this money, it got me paranoid, yeah
You know that pump sound like a bomb nigga
Blicka bomb nigga, huh
Ayy we got AR's, all of 'em got drums in 'em, yeah
We gon' turn this bitch to Lil Vietnam nigga, yeah
We gon' turn this bitch to Lil Vietnam nigga, yeah

[Chorus: YFN Lucci]
A boss is one who guarantee we gon' eat
How you gon' tell a boss somethin' he don't know?
How you hold your nuts on a nigga you don't know?
Just know I'm holdin' on that yop and only lord know
Yeah, and never let 'em steal your ambition
Ain't we all thankful that we livin'?
Everybody wanna be the boss, everybody don't listen
As a child I was taught you gotta pay attention

[Verse 2: Ralo]
How you add on the people you say you cool with? (Huh?)
I got more money than the people I went to school with (Yeah)
I done took some losses but it don't look like I lose shit (No)
I done put in work, ain't none of them niggas do shit
I took my bitch on a cruise ship, bought mama a new whip
Bought my sister a house 'cause I was sick of her mouth
And if she don't pay her rent, no one ain't kickin' her out
And if I run out of dope, the whole city a drought, yeah
They keep callin' my phone, I'm tryna make me a song
I put my clothes in the trap 'cause the trap is my home (Yeah)
Why do you smell like weed? (Why?), weed is my cologne (Yeah)
They cannot catch me with them bricks, I get them bitches gone

[Chorus: YFN Lucci]
A boss is one who guarantee we gon' eat
How you gon' tell a boss somethin' he don't know?
How you hold your nuts on a nigga you don't know?
Just know I'm holdin' on that yop and only lord know
Yeah, and never let 'em steal your ambition
Ain't we all thankful that we livin'?
Everybody wanna be the boss, everybody don't listen
As a child I was taught you gotta pay attention
