[Verse 1]
I told my bitch to be patience watch me go get it
I swear im so in love with that money im committed
OG told me stay down stack that paper i listened
OG told me stay down stack that paper you think i did it?
R.I.P grandma, look atcha grandson
We only wanted a couple of millions now that's all
Had some kidnap these rappers for ransom, who want some?         bet i be that boy they ran from
They don't want none
Way before the deal nigga, we done did margielas
I only fuck with my niggas they will respect us
It's only room for my niggas no need for extras
Just filled my house with more pistols, the more the better
Lord forgive us but they ain't never want to give us not a thang, so we loaded them thangs went and handle some thangs
Fell in love with drug money and chains
Make a wrong move hammers will bang
My trigga finger itching
Babymomz going dumb and plus my palms keep itching lord knows a nigga wrong but may God be with me
Lord knows a nigga wrong but may God be with me

[Hook]
I just sit and get high and brainstorm
Momma told me don't go out there with them chains on
I told momma don't worry because I ain't alone
I told momma don't worry because I ain't alone
I just sit and get high and brainstorm
Momma told me don't go out there with them chains on
I told momma don't worry because I ain't alone
I told momma don't worry because I ain't alone

[Verse 2]
I told her i'd be damn momma they know who i am momma
Just understand why I hustle I want mad commas
Mad lumber mad love for my brothers
Mad dawgs in the duffle  you mad boy nigga fuck ya
I was raised in the struggle
Young nigga walkin around with AK's in the gutta
Babymama straight you know they hate her
Lil bitch mad cause I ain't save her
I can't wait til this shit pay off

[Hook]
I just sit and get high and brainstorm
Momma told me don't go out with all them chains on
They always told me keep goin and ur day will come
Aye momma told me through the bullshit remain calm
So i sit and get high and brainstorm
Momma told me don't go out there with all them chains on
Told momma don't worry because I ain't alone
I told momma don't worry because i ain't alone
