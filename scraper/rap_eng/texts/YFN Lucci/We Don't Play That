[Intro: Blac Youngsta]
Yeah, nigga
You get one chance, one life, one strike, nigga
What you gon' do wit it?
The choice is yours nigga
Don't chase the money chase the dream nigga

[Hook: Blac Youngsta]
We don't play that
We send killers where you lay at
They gon' have to come and spray that
We already K that
All I wanted was some rest
All I wanted was a Maybach
I got a Maybach
Lord can you bless my soul
Know I coulda been gone
I just wanna get some winning
I just wanna live long
Young nigga, tryna run up a check
(Woah, woah, woah, woah!)
Young nigga rockin' VVS
(Lil' nigga, lil' nigga, lil' nigga!)
Young nigga, all I know is flex
(Rich nigga, Rich nigga, Rich nigga!)
Young nigga die for my respect

[Verse 1: Johnny Cinco & Blac Youngsta]
I pulled up in a Maybach
They didn't know it was a Maybach
Young nigga wit the K strapped
That'll spray a nigga way back
Still spendin' money from way back
When young nigga pull up and take that
He gotta pay for the Wraith back
Hard to replace that (Fuck nigga!)
I'm a savage let me shoutout to my partner
We gon' hide 'em
We don't do no fuckin' robbing
YFN Lucci is my brother
We gon' bust fye for each other
We gon' stand in the line for each other
Ain't nothing I won't do for my brother
Ain't nothing I won't do for my brother
Ain't nothing I won't do for my mother
Stay down in the trap with the same niggas 24/7
Tryna get the money
I fell off bad but I shook back
All that shit we done shook that
We done rob everybody we done took that
I was sellin' good crack, I was going to school with dope in my book bag

[Hook: Blac Youngsta]
