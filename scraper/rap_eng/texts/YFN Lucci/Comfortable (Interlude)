[Intro]
Aye, aye, aye
Uh, uh
Yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
I'll never let up, that what I do
I'ma hold it down, that what I do
Can't fall off, I am not you
I'ma go hard, that what I do
We all know that you can't get too comfortable, yeah
Comfortable, yeah

[Verse]
Dope niggas, now I get a whole damn brick for a riddle
See we ain't have ride we used to walk when we was little
We was so young but had hustle
Where would I be without you
All them damn dreams thank God it came true
Came in the game like Shaq in '92
They better know a nigga had more soul
And I know that money bring hoes and these hoes bring lies
Know my bro gon ride better know he ain't lying
Long live my nigga Lord know it one time
I'ma get them sucker that's on everything I bet
I was down bad, can't believe where I'm at
I cannot lose, no way, no way
I'ma talk to you every time I pray, and I'ma go hard

[Chorus]
I'll never let up, that what I do
I'ma hold it down, that what I do
Can't fall off, I am not you
I'ma go hard, that what I do
We all know that you can't get too comfortable, yeah
Comfortable, yeah
(We all know
We all know, we all know
We all know, we all know you can't get too comfortable, yeah
Comfortable)
I'll never let up, that what I do
I'ma hold it down, that what I do
Can't fall off, I am not you
I'ma go hard, that what I do
We all know that you can't get too comfortable, yeah
Comfortable, yeah
