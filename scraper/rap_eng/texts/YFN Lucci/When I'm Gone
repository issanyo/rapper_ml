[Intro]
Buddah blessed this beat
Think It's A Game

[Chorus]
They gon miss me when I'm gone
Pour out some liquor for your dawgs gone
Pour up a pint wit ya dawg 'till it's all gone
They gon miss me when I'm gone yeah yeah
When you down and out who can you call on
And this was way before the phone
They know I'm pickin' up
Better know I'm pushin' up

[Verse 1]
This was way before Pradas, we was some young niggas we ain't have no role models
Go hit the block and get some cheese that just how we was brought up
Fly nigga since a teen leveled up and now we ballin' like the globetrotters
Road runner money long as four hundred
All my jugs worth bout four hundred
I'm a stunner boy my pinky ring blingin' like a mu-mufucka
And I'm sippin' lean cup lookin' like a mud puddle yeah
Try and get my set you gon have to tackle me
Tongue wrestle please, Ima boss you gotta answer me
Raise your hand to speak when I raise my hand they eat nigga
You know where I'm from what they gon do bout me nigga

[Chorus]
They gon miss me when I'm gone
Pour out some liquor for your dawgs gone
Pour up a pint wit ya dawg 'till it's all gone
They gon miss me when I'm gone yeah yeah
When you down and out who can you call on
And this was way before the phone yeah
They know I'm pickin' up
Better know I'm pushin' up

[Verse 2]
Aye when they call I'm pickin' up
Any beef I'm pushin' up
Bought my nigga, my family, my paper it's war
I want answers nigga
All day and night we get active nigga
Broad day on sight, you know we all got a pipe
Plus we all got on ice
You know we strapped everywhere we go like we all got license yeah
Don't get popped like a Vicodin

Never look at me wrong we gon cut out ya eyelids
I'm not the one to sleep on what the fuck is you tired bitch?
And I don't wanna see yours I'ma wait and get my shit
Knowin' y'all my mains Ion't be fuckin' no side chicks

[Chorus]
They gon miss me when I'm gone
Pour out some liquor for your dawgs gone
Pour up a pint wit ya dawg 'till it's all gone
They gon miss me when I'm gone yeah yeah
When you down and out who can you call on
And this was way before the phone yeah
They know I'm pickin' up
Better know I'm pushin' up
