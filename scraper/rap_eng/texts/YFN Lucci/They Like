[Verse 1: Yo Gotti]
Talkin' 'bout a nigga, ye ain't never gon' win
Told a bitch I like her and her girlfriend
Told that bitch I want her and her twin sister
Then I fucked her with my chains on and my pistol
I'm a dope boy, I be ballin'
I got dope money in my Balmains
Take a nigga bitch, I feel like Scarface
Damn her ass too big, I think they all fake
Never knew I't gon' be like that
Truck got the big B on that
Chain got the CMG on that
Price high, we can't eat like that
Niggas hatin', you can't eat like that
We ain't liked you, we never did
Canâ€™t knock her for getting her bread
Shawty thick, I just want that head

She like real niggas, she don't do lames
Son foreign, got pregnant it in that Mulsanne
She got gang babe, we call her Wu-Tang
Hair weave killer, call me 2 Chainz
Lying on your dick, boy you too lame
I been bustin' outta like a shootin' rang'
She text me she ain't fuck, I'm thinkin' who ain't
Came through in that Lamb', mood changed
Purse on deck, Rollie on set
Him? Upset, him? Obsessed
