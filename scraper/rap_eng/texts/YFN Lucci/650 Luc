[Chorus]
I been ridin' in that 650 coupe, 650 coupe, 650 coupe
Yeah, slidin' in that 650 coupe, 650 coupe, 650 coupe
Nowadays they call me 650 Luc, 650 Luc, 650 Luc
Ridin' in that 650 coupe, 650 coupe, 650 coupe

[Verse 1]
I don't fuck wit' strangers, got a bad attitude, lot of anger
Yeah, for that brown bag, you get ate up
When you down bad, they don't save ya
Had to hustle for everything a nigga got, on my Pops
Big brother fuckin' up Grandmama pots, that boy hot
In the kitchen playin' wit' all that damn fire
Young boy got that pole on him, know that boy'll ride
If a nigga say I told on him, then that boy a lie
Death before dishonor, I'ma be like that until I die
Gotta be careful out here, I can not skress that shit alot
God blessin' me alot, thanks for gettin' me off that block, yeah

[Chorus]
I been ridin' in that 650 coupe, 650 coupe, 650 coupe
Yeah, slidin' in that 650 coupe, 650 coupe, 650 coupe
Nowadays they call me 650 Luc, 650 Luc, 650 Luc
Ridin' in that 650 coupe, 650 coupe, 650 coupe

[Verse 2]
Yeah uh, dreamin' about that 745, Grandma still fightin' for her life
Yeah uh, I been down bad, but I been tryin', pockets dry
I done gave away too much of mine, but I'ma be just fine
I don't even remember the last time, I paid my rent on time
We ain't got no gas and it ain't hot, but we still survived
Steph went to jail for his first time, they still gave him 9
And we didn't even ask the Lord why? My man still alive
All these court cases got me traumatized
And all this money talkin' got my tongue tied
And kickin' doors got my lil' cuzz 5
I been paper chasin' for a long time

[Chorus]
I been ridin' in that 650 coupe, 650 coupe, 650 coupe
Yeah, slidin' in that 650 coupe, 650 coupe, 650 coupe
Nowadays they call me 650 Luc, 650 Luc, 650 Luc
Ridin' in that 650 coupe, 650 coupe, 650 coupe

Think it's a game?
