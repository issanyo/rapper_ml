[Hook: Young Toni Montana]
I’m slave to the streets
This grave I’m ready to meet
Imma guy just tryna survive
Don’t know why y'all want me to die (x2)



[Verse 1:Young Toni Montana]
Whether you bump me in Ya dark blue Cadillac
Or you selling dope or addicted with snorting crack
You know I don’t lack when it comes to street info
Used to know a guy who can give u indo and Dro
Turned out to be fronting like he want something
But if I pull out a shank her ain’t gon want nothing
Caught up with the best type of weed
And I really don’t care to say that honestly
More bullshit ain’t nothing good troubles ain’t nothing stopping it
More people spraying gats wearing bandanas caught up in hood politics
Macs and straps popping people dropping suddenly
Bats and gats copping all them keys is it worth it for a felony
I’m down with the clique down with the crips down with you
Ride with me die with me bang beside me and you’ll see what we do
It’s true I wear blue but fucc them pigs
I’ll snap a neck like a twig once again fuck lil iggs
