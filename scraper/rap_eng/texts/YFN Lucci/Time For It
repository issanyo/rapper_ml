[Intro]
Street shit nigga you know what the fuck goin' on
You know, my first album and shit man
You know, a nigga done came far, in this big ass house

[Verse 1]
Look, aye I chose rappin' over everything
See we was trappin' and bustin' checks before the deal came
I still can't believe my cousin died before the deal came
That's why sometimes I just get high I ain't tryin' to feel pain
See I could just sit here and lie but that'll feel strange
And rap about all the shit I don't got and not the real thing
See you know me I made it out and that's the real change
Where I come from you sell drugs, rap, or gang bang
Damn a nigga life changed, damn I live a piped dream
I can give a damn if no one like me
I can see my future and it's shiney
I been working hard, I been grinding, I'ma go so hard about my kids
Yeah

[Chorus]
Said I won't stop
I'ma grind hard
I'ma shine hard
Swear it's time for it
I'ma grind hard, yeah
I'ma shine hard, yeah hey
Yeah hey uh
I'ma grind for it
I'ma shine for it
I'ma do whatever it takes when it's time for it
Yeah, when it's time for it, I'd die for it, yeah

[Verse 2]
Uh, aye Diamond graduated
I just bought my momma a house I hated where she stayed
I turned myself into a boss, I made myself a way
I had to take a couple losses but I heard you gotta pay to play
I come from where niggas tote hammers I heard you never do
Totin' pumps, nines, whatever, shit, we just like to shoot
Don't never let that hatin' shit mess with you, I don't never do
Never let a broke ass nigga tell you what best to do
And I'm way ahead of you, I'm that dope on the block and the residue yeah
I'm a young fly nigga and I got revenue yeah
This a true story that I'm telling you yeah hey

[Chorus]
Said I won't stop
I'ma grind hard
I'ma shine hard
Swear it's time for it
I'ma grind hard, yeah
I'ma shine hard, yeah hey
Yeah hey uh
I'ma grind for it
I'ma shine for it
I'ma do whatever it takes when it's time for it
Yeah, when it's time for it, I'd die for it, yeah
