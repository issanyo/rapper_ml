[Intro: Meek Mill]
Yeah
I got Lucci in this bitch with me
On some real shit, I remember we ain't had nothing
Dead broke, I'm talking pain and suffering
They ain't goin' feel my pain, they don't know where we come from

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
I can talk shit 'cause I was shit
Diamonds shining on me, need a off switch
Niggas talking crazy, get 'em all hit
Put the call in from Dubai, on some boss shit
Brand new Maybach, this ain't Ross shit
This my shit, I be talking fly shit
Clean them niggas up with that mop stick
Hating on me, that'll get your baby mom hit
Turks and Caicos, spending pesos
Niggas flying private with them Draco's
Pull up in your city, like it ain't yours
Put a check up on your hitter, and it's case closed
Still change hoes like I change clothes
Chain froze, Range Rov', and I'm playin' Hov
Flashbacks, seeing cops in them plain clothes
My nigga fighting open cases and they ain’t close

[Hook: YFN Lucci]
I'm a young king
I'm a young king
Remember all them nightmares, all them bad dreams
Remember all them nights, when we didn't have a thing
So it's only right a nigga living like a king
How you goin' tell me you ain't never had dreams
If it was to be a baller or triple beam
We goin' fuck 'em all up, with the whole team
Young nigga
Y-Young nigga dream

[Verse 2: Meek Mill]
Niggas talking tough, we calling you bluff
Took a call, got him hit, while I'm talking to Puff
Man down, man I shouldn't be talking this stuff
The nigga that you claim a hitter, the target to us
Caught him in the morning, like it's Tom Joyner
Doc plugging cables to him like its Time Warner
Time to pull the plug on him, let his mom mourn him
Got a suicide squad like a bomb on him
Spin a block on a nigga talking rah rah
He was playin' with the birdies, now it's bye-bye
I know Jigga, I know Emory and Ty-Ty
Roc-Nation on my chain, 'cause it's Ta-Da
Nigga, I'm the truth, I'm like W'Allah
Every time I make a movie it be Sci-Fi
Looking scary in that Ghost when I ride by
Niggas sayin' I wouldn't make it, I'm like voilà
I know magic, I'm a savage
It's a plane, it's a bird, it's a bad bitch
I ain't trippin' 'bout her, you can have it
They was happy when we was broke, now we mad rich
Young nigga, talkin' cash shit
You can tell we ain't never really had shit
Turned my momma public house into a glass crib
Now my guest house bigger than my last crib

[Hook: YFN Lucci]
I'm a young king
I'm a young king
Remember all them nightmares, all them bad dreams
Remember all them nights, when we didn't have a thing
So it's only right a nigga living like a king
How you goin' tell me you ain't never had dreams
If it was to be a baller or triple beam
We goin' fuck 'em all up, with the whole team
Young nigga
Y-Young nigga dream

[Outro: Barcelini]
See, they treated us like peasants
But we always knew we had the blood of kings pumping through our veins
Dreamchasers!, we took the stone out the rubbles and built a palace
Money, power, and violence
Sippin' Spade on the Island
Killin' these niggas, moment of silence-
'Cause we done rose through the slums and beat all odds
We the poster child for every young nigga in the streets
You see us on T.V., you see who your son's aspiring to be
It was plenty nights, man, we ain't had nothin' to eat
I'm talking, cup of noodles or maybe some cream of wheat
Now it's French [?] when we feel like it
We don't even do Philippe's
I mean, you wouldn't believe me if I showed you
I'm talking 10-15 thousand dollars on the tab, that's just on wine
This lifestyle, it'll blow your mind
You know, we goin' have it our way
Young kings, living out the dream
Bossed up, on every scene
The Mobb nigga, Barcelini
