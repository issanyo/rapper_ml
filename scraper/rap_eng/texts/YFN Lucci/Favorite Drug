[Chorus: Yung Bleu]
We gon' party at your favorite club, we gon' bring your favorite drug (drug, drug, drug, drug)
Got this money 'cause it ain't enough, got this money 'cause it ain't enough
Send me a fine yellow bitch to the front and I'ma eat her
Need a fine chocolate bitch to the front and I'ma beat her
Send me a fine yellow bitch to the front and I'ma eat her
We gon' party at your favorite club, we gon' bring your favorite drug

[Verse 1: Yung Bleu]
I got my Nikes on, I got my ice on
You play the right song, get me in the right zone
Layover, stay over, no you don't need a flight home
Your name in my iPhone, make it rain like a cyclone
Oscar de la Hoya when I knock it out
Work with me, no clockin' out, let's see what that mouth about
Gotta make you walk it out (ooh)
Just tell me what you talkin' 'bout, what you talkin' 'bout

[Chorus: Yung Bleu]
We gon' party at your favorite club, we gon' bring your favorite drug (drug, drug, drug, drug)
Got this money 'cause it ain't enough, got this money 'cause it ain't enough
Send me a fine yellow bitch to the front and I'ma eat her
Need a fine chocolate bitch to the front and I'ma beat her
Send me a fine yellow bitch to the front and I'ma eat her
We gon' party at your favorite club, we gon' bring your favorite drug

[Verse 2: YFN Lucci]
Ayy I like chocolate, you my chocolate bar
Girl come let me eat you up inside my car
Just be careful girl, don't drop that top, yeah
Just be careful girl, don't pop that top
Huh, come help me count this money girl, this ain't enough
Come bring me all your heart, 'cause girl this ain't enough
I can't stay away from her, yeah
I need like eight of her, yeah, I need I like eight of her, yeah
I'm tryin' to cater to her, girl come let me cater to you
Uh uh, I brought back cake for her, yeah
I only vacate with her, yeah, I flew to LA with her, yeah
You got me sprung, girl you my favorite drug
I can't go a night without my favorite drug, yeah

[Chorus: Yung Bleu]
We gon' party at your favorite club, we gon' bring your favorite drug (drug, drug, drug, drug)
Got this money 'cause it ain't enough, got this money 'cause it ain't enough
Send me a fine yellow bitch to the front and I'ma eat her
Need a fine chocolate bitch to the front and I'ma beat her
Send me a fine yellow bitch to the front and I'ma eat her
Need a fine chocolate bitch to the front and I'ma beat her
We gon' party at your favorite club, we gon' bring your favorite drug

[Bridge: YFN Lucci]
Ayy like a perc, she got me, when I'm on syrup, she got me
Like I be high all day when I smoke herb, she got me
My favorite drug, don't you know you my favorite drug

[Chorus: Yung Bleu]
We gon' party at your favorite club, we gon' bring your favorite drug (drug, drug, drug, drug)
Got this money 'cause it ain't enough, got this money 'cause it ain't enough
Send me a fine yellow bitch to the front and I'ma eat her
Need a fine chocolate bitch to the front and I'ma beat her
Send me a fine yellow bitch to the front and I'ma eat her
We gon' party at your favorite club, we gon' bring your favorite drug
