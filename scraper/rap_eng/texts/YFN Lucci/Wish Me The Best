[Intro]
Out there out with my brother Lucci well
I need y'all to want to be the best
You digg what I'm sayin'?
(Fam Goon)

[Hook: Ralo]
Tell em wish me the best, don't you ever wish me no less
All I want is success I don't a fuck about the rest
I swear the sun don't make me sweat
And (?) won't make me wet
I swear I'm goin' to get my best
They never know what we invest
So wish me the best, don't you ever wish me no less
So wish me the best, don't you ever wish me no less
All I want is success I don't give a fuck about the rest
I swear the sun don't make me sweat
And the storm won't make me wet
I swear I'm goin' to get my best
They never know what we invest
So wish me the best, don't you ever wish me no less

[Verse 1: Ralo]
I trust my big mulla more than I trust some of these niggas dog
Fuck what you heard, you gon' hear pistols if you piss him off
I done got up and I never look back
I told my son that you better than that
I know my niggas ain't ever gon' rat
They know my niggas ain't goin' for that
I used to trap in the same clothes
Them nigga actin' like they ain't know
It's not a place that I can't go
I'ma die for this bankroll
I get on the stage, they know that I'm made
I've never been late, I'm never delayed
Don't get off the stage unless I get paid
I get that money, it's somethin' in the way
These niggas get saved
I do whatever it take
I got a house on the lake
I didn't get here by mistake
Tell 'em to wish me the best
I might fuck up but I give it my best
Tell 'em to wish me the best
I might fuck up but I give it my best

[Hook: Ralo]
So wish me the best, don't you ever wish me no less
All I want is success I don't a fuck about the rest
I swear the sun don't make me sweat
And (?) won't make me wet
I swear I'm goin' to get my best
They never know what we invest
So wish me the best, don't you ever wish me no less
So wish me the best, don't you ever wish me no less
All I want is success I don't a fuck about the rest
I swear the sun don't make me sweat
And (?) won't make me wet
I swear I'm goin' to get my best
They never know what we invest
So wish me the best, don't you ever wish me no less

[Verse 2: YFN Lucci]
I got a lot to confess
But I probably never confess
You know how many licks we done hit
You know that I ain't never been a lick
No more arm and that lit
I'm the wrong one to mess with
See we ain't even gon' scratch shit
You gon' need more than a vest bitch
Leave 'em redder than the exit sign
All these bad bitches on my line
All this money on me and it's mine
Catch a body, lately I've been tryin'
Since they took my brother I've been (?)
Gotta let it heal, it take time
Gotta let it heal, it take time
(I wish they wish me the best)
(I wish they wish me the best)
I hope they wish me the best
I hope they wish me the best
I hope they wish me the best
Lately I've been prayin' on my success
Lately man I've been a threat
I hope they wish me the best

[Hook: Ralo]
So wish me the best, don't you ever wish me no less
All I want is success I don't a fuck about the rest
I swear the sun don't make me sweat
And the storm won't make me wet
I swear I'm goin' to get my best
They never know what we invest
So wish me the best, don't you ever wish me no less
So wish me the best, don't you ever wish me no less
All I want is success I don't give a fuck about the rest
I swear the sun don't make me sweat
And the smoke won't make me wet
I swear I'm goin' to get my best
They never know what we invest
So wish me the best, don't you ever wish me no less

[Verse 3: Ralo]
I got a lot to confess
Let me go make my confession
I know that I'm guilty for flexin'
And these niggas taught me a lesson
I never (?) with a (?)
I don't call bitches my bestie
Every time swear they catch me
They catch me with a weapon
I ain't got time but I never got off it
I done made all of my homies some bosses
I know my lady ain't never gon' cross me
When you hear bout me you bout me ballin'
Hear bout me ballin' or hear bout me flexin'
I bet you never gon' hear bout me stressin'
I got that money, I never got selfish
I do this shit for them niggas that left me
I feel the best that I ever felt
Them bitches lovin' me everywhere
How could they say that I never cared?
I was down when everybody left
Them niggas traited
I know that they gon' hate it
They know that I made it out of my situation
They cannot ever replace me
I used to sleep in the basement
Tell 'em lil niggas I made it
Yeah tell 'em lil niggas I made it
Yeah tell 'em lil niggas I made it

[Hook: Ralo]
So wish me the best, don't you ever wish me no less
