[Verse]:
A whole lot on my brain
Too much pressure and pain
I waited all day it ain’t came
Too much on me how I can’t complain
I ain’t got a dollar to my name, uh
I ain’t got a dollar to my name
I was walking in and out the bank
I always chose money over fame
I was trapping hours for them thangs
I was tryna eat I knew I had some weight to gain, Yeah

Made it, jumped of the porch as a baby
Swear we made it, we escaped it, I am not a greater baby
I’m related to the paper, I am not an 80 baby
Imma Georgia bapta baby, ion mine gettin’ you ate x2
I got some young niggas hold me down for a plate
I got some young niggas tryna line up a plate
I got some young niggas on my line every time if you play, uhhhuh

[Chorus]:
Patient my dawg, sometimes you just gotta wait till it come
Making my play I ain’t praying for much
Taking my chances were never too much, never too much
Never give up, who would’ve thought it was never enough x3
Aye aye uhh

Aye
Yeah yeah aye aye
Yeah yeah yeah aye aye uhuhh
Who would’ve thought it was never enough x3

[Verse]:
Yeah look
Ok look hustle to that bag
Hustle yeah I hustle like my dad
I come from where them young niggas got gas
I come from doing bad
See I was one stay out there in the bag

Uh tell why the fuck you would do that
I’m used to spending big shit, im good at doing that
Don’t make me spend a ten just to get yo ass whacked
And we gone spend again man you know we coming back

And the slum and the trenches

[Verse]:
Ok we waited, look how long we waited
Told me stop that drankin, too much medication
They told me be patient, I been sitting her thankin

[Bridge]:
Be patient my dawg x3
You know at times you can’t never give up
And no too much time just ain’t never enough, ain’t never enough
Never give up, don’t put yo faith in what you can not trust
Don’t you know diamonds was found in the mud
Don’t you know I just climbed out the mud

[Chorus]:
Patient my dawg, sometimes you just gotta wait till it come
Making my play I ain’t praying for much
Taking my chances were never too much, never too much
Never give up, who would’ve thought it was never enough x3
Aye aye uhh
