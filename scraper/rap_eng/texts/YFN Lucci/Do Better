See we was all working, shit was good all week, shit was good just a week ago

Yeahhhhhhh

Lucci: Verse 1

Late night in the studio working, yeah we was all working
Shit was good just a week ago, everything was perfect
Shit feel good and I deserve it, aye don't you hate that feeling when you nervous?
But ain't none like that feeling that you get when you spendin & you know i drop a band on every purchase
Put a price on ya head then go purchase him, go ask about me in the hood yeah they worship him
Behind curtains I pour up a seal, if any problems we get them church's filled
Yeah I'm straight from the bottom now im finally upstairs, gotta watch where I step they got mines over there
Through all the bullshit still gotta persevere, yeah I got em next year, shit im finally here yeah
She ain't never sat up in a ghost, she ain't never sit front row, cause she ain't really know, that
The difference between me is im on go, and between me and you yo man he a hoe
And between me and you I leave at 4, at the airport to lean to the floor
Im tryna get a ring like 3 in a row, ima machine something mean on the low, yeah

Johnny Cinco (Chorus)

Do better, she'll do better
You gotta do better girl, You shoulda knew better girl
If she knew better, Then she'll do better
You gotta do better girl, you shoulda knew better girl
I'm in that new thang, I got on 2 chains
Bitch dis ain't 2Chainz,2 bitches with me in 2 lanes
New Bentley mulsanne 3x

Johnny Cinco: Verse 2

Bitch I'm john popi da running back, bring the whole thang better run it back
I'm in dat bed with the ceiling cracked, I know they mad I ain't run it back
Hunnids on me I ain't givin back, Went to paris I ain't comin back
She come wit me she ain't comin back, give me a week probably send her back
I got the money man confidential, so many hunnids ain't no tellin what she'll do
She might turn up for da crew, pass dat lil bitch around and send her right back to you
I send her right back to you, if it ain't right send dem pints back to you
The life that I chose, a lot I can lose
Do what you can, I do what I choose
Sit down don't move, im in a coop
Feelin like Hefner, Versace on my shoes
Bitch im da man put Balmain on my hoe
Givenchy my toes, my hoes and my hoes
Shirt by chinchilla it match wit da coat
Bitch im john popi yeah I do da most
Call baby bra ima need me a 4
John popi, Lucci how could you go wrong?

*Repeat chorus*
