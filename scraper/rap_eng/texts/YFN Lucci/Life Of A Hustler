[Chorus: YFN Lucci]
Ayy this the life of a hustler, the life of a hustler, yeah
'Bout to stay down all day 'til you make your money double up
You gotta get paid, stay down 'til you run it up, yeah
Ayy this the life of a hustler, the life of a hustler
You gotta make your money triple up, fill it up, then you up
You gotta get it up, the life of a hustler

[Verse 1: YFN Lucci]
Hah yeah, rose gold pieces, rose gold Jesus
Tryna shine so bright the whole world sees me
I been stackin' up that paper, it ain't no secret
I got like five hundred K in the Four Seasons
Uh, when it come to playin' I went geek
I'm with AP, I'm with Cartier bracelet and Philippe
Uh, I just bought a couple houses, I just cashed out, I ain't leased
And they say money talk, well I don't talk for free, yeah
Hell no, I don't talk for free, hell no
I don't talk to police, hell no
And no I don't speak hell no (fuck wrong?), yeah

[Chorus: YFN Lucci]
Ayy this the life of a hustler, the life of a hustler, yeah
'Bout to stay down all day 'til you make your money double up
You gotta get paid, stay down 'til you run it up, yeah
Ayy this the life of a hustler, the life of a hustler
You gotta make your money triple up, fill it up, then you up
You gotta get it up, the life of a hustler

[Verse 2: YFN Lucci]
Uh, real hustler
Grandma told me get that paper and bring some more to her
And they always told me go and grind, never fall in love
When you havin' all of this paper you don't know who to trust
Ooh when you be havin' all of this paper, be hard to put it up
Check on his head, I put it up, play with the boy, we pullin' up
Got me a bag and filled it up, yeah
I'm in my bag, I'm 'bout to bust
Forty pointer, this shit flooded, huh yeah
Real hustler, when you runnin' out of paper, we runnin' it up
And we ain't worried 'bout a nigga ever takin' from us
And stayed down, came up, made that money triple up, real hustler

[Chorus: YFN Lucci]
Ayy this the life of a hustler, the life of a hustler, yeah
'Bout to stay down all day 'til you make your money double up
You gotta get paid, stay down 'til you run it up, yeah
Ayy this the life of a hustler, the life of a hustler
You gotta make your money triple up, fill it up, then you up
You gotta get it up, the life of a hustler
