[Verse 1: Mozzy]
Conversation with God, pray I make it out the slums
Granny fell apart when they gave her baby dub
I just fell out with my nigga, tried to play me for some crumbs
Death before dishonory, for real is fake as fuck
Half a eight in the cup, fell asleep on the gwala
It get murky in these waters, blood be wit piranhas
And we don't do the drive by's, we on feet wit the llama
Pick him off, drop the yicki off and meet at my momma's
They say the vehicle description was a purple Impala
My lil nigga eatin, he just murder for commas
And Hi-Points is for dorks you couldn't learn it in college
Understand how I live when niggas squirt up ya cottage
We servin' the 'cotics, it killed me when they murdered my patna
Dirt on the yoppa, you know we put in work wit the yoppa
I'm nervous around you, they say you on that work lil patna
I ain't seen it, but I heard somethin bout it, stay over there lil patna

[Chorus: YFN Lucci]
And we was only tryna make a way
They say the good die young, the good die young
I'm tryna go another way
They told us spread love like the Brooklyn way
But where I come from all we do it take
And we was only tryna make a way

[Verse 2: YFN Lucci]
Conversation with the Devil, told the boy 'I'm a rebel'
Told the boy, 'It's whatever'
Made it outta that shit, hoe nigga I'm clever
And we gone see how quick a bitch fold, we won't let up
Let that bitch Nina Ross gone kiss 'em
I only got six shots left, I won't miss 'em
Give a fuck if your bitch ridin', she get popped with 'em
Nah, we don't give no fucks, not even a little
Catch em at the light, camera face, how I did 'em
Plug just hit my phone, A-Boogie how I get 'em
You know right or wrong, lil nigga
I'm slidin' with 'em, lil nigga
The fire with 'em, lil nigga
We tryna end them lil niggas

[Chorus: YFN Lucci]
And we was only tryna make a way
They say the good die young, the good die young
I'm tryna go another way
They told us spread love like the Brooklyn way
But where I come from all we do it take
And we was only tryna make a way

[Verse 3: Kolyon]
I ain't lookin' for no nigga, 'cause I'm scrapin'
By the time they started showing love, I realized it was fake
Will I ever catch a break? I bet it's never what they say
My block been mighty hot, I think the Devil on his way
Glock .40, 30 shots, I brought a shovel for a snake
Know nothin' 'bout no murder, don't know shit about your case
It's death before dishonor with them burners to my face
I'm out here slidin' with no learners, throwin' pistols in the lake
They told me make a way, I loaded clips and bitch I baked a cake
Ain't no turtle beat no rabbit in no street race
See, I might leave you with your life but I'm gonna take the safe
And motherfuck a finish line, we ain't got no brakes

[Chorus: YFN Lucci]
And we was only tryna make a way
They say the good die young, the good die young
I'm tryna go another way
They told us spread love like the Brooklyn way
But where I come from all we do it take
And we was only tryna to make a way
