[Intro: 2 Chainz]
About to roll some more of this shit too
I got the boy Lucci with me
We might come in there and take, all the hoes
Like I could rob, like, everybody there

[Verse 1: 2 Chainz]
That Chanel shit, I like that
Got your own ride, I like that
Got your mind right, I like that
In a fantasy world, I'd wife that
At the blue flame with 2 chains on
8 rings on, maintain home
Got pulled over on the way home
Used to make juugs off the payphone
Left mama's crib with a thousand Nikes
Niggas know I had a thousand wifeys
Hood nigga, had a thousand vices
Hit Benihanas for a thousand rices
Garlic butter with the yum yum
You know the south side where I come from
Hit the dealership with a lump sum
Make her pump the gas with her pumps on
With some pom poms, that's Don Juan
Don Julio, trap house needs cuticles
Trap house need a studio
Trap house need a new sofa
These young niggas keep fuckin' on it
I do this shit so big I can get Puffy on it

[Hook: YFN Lucci]
I can tell you in love with her
Tell you in love with her
Yeah you can tell I'm just fuckin' her
Don't you tell that I'm fuckin' her
Yeah you can tell you be cuffin' her
Steady cuffin' her while I be fuckin' her
Yeah you be cuffin' her while I be fuckin' her

[Verse 2: YFN Lucci]
Meanwhile I was gettin' head with my chain on
Drophead, yeah the brain gone
Plain Jane on, gettin' rained on
No time to complain, homes
Know I'm tired, took a plane home
Know my cars and everything on
Know that I murder everything I'm on
I ain't even gotta say I'm on
Yeah I smoke good, paper long
Paper good, wish you would twist the wood
Grip the wood, grip it good
Go and juug, get the good, split the goods
Get the guns, split the guns, flip the guns
Yeah, yeah, uh
We gon' take a nigga's bitch
Take a nigga's bitch, make a nigga sick
Fucked her like my bitch

Make a nigga sick
Take a nigga's bitch, fuck her like my bitch
I can tell you in love with that bitch

[Hook: YFN Lucci]
I can tell you in love with her

Yeah you can tell you be cuffin' her
Steady cuffin' her while I be fuckin' her

[Verse 3: 2 Chainz]
Downstairs at the Fontainebleau
Pour a deuce in a Mountain Dew
Did everything that I had to do
Used to blaze like Moreland Avenue
If you tryna sell me that pussy then you a prostitute, cool!
I'm a back massage and a good head connoisseur, truuuu!
I'm speedin' down left lanes
Goyard belt gang
Then important text came
She wanna play them sex games
I'm up for that and I'm undefeated
She undeniable underneath me
She told me that I can take the pussy
Just take it easy
Celine bag when she came to see me
Had sex with my watch on, knock her rocks off
Ride around with the top off
Like hot sauce, drop off
Cartier wristwear, it don't come off, yeah
I still got her suckin' dick while she cottonmouth, yeah

[Hook: YFN Lucci]
I can tell you in love with her
Tell you in love with her
Yeah you can tell I'm just fuckin' her
Don't you tell that I'm fuckin' her
Yeah you can tell you be cuffin' her
Steady cuffin' her while I be fuckin' her
Yeah you be cuffin' her while I be fuckin' her
Yeah
