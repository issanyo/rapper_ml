[Intro: YFN Lucci]
Hey hey hey
Yeah yeah, hey
Look, uh
You know the real gon' always stand out nigga
The fake gon' always lose, uh, look

[Chorus: YFN Lucci]
When there's a will better know there's a way, hey
Time to separate the real from the fake, uh
Nigga tryna take mine, he gon' have to pay, yeah
Tryna play with mine, better plan a wake, uh
Better play it safe
Whole lot of sticks slidin' on the interstate
You know we can't be worryin' 'bout what they gon' say
You know we can't be worried, everybody gon' hate
A whole lot of hate, where the love at, yeah, hey
I knew that one day I would get saved
I knew that one day I would get paid
Now I'ma ball on 'em like Dikembe, hey
Where there's a will, no nigga there's a way
I guess it's time to separate the real from the fake
A nigga tryna take mine, he gon' have to pay
A nigga tryna play with mine, he better plan a wake, oh, oh

[Verse 1: Neek Bucks]
Still pop a rose for every tint I shade
I think these niggas tryna hit my hay
I go to sleep every night good knowin' that the clique got fed
Feds came, the whole clique got grabbed, I think this shit might spread
Ten bands for the lawyer in case they do come
These killers around me, they gon' wan' eat when the food done
Kick 'em off the table, they try to plot on a new one
That's why I fully loaded this forty in case they do come
They want me back to servin' the fiends, back to runnin' from D's
I built a team they couldn't come in between
Always had the diamond fetish for the watch, it was me
Harlem niggas, still will spin your block with knots in my jeans
Still grindin' get the clique paid
I know that one day we gon' be straight
Love my bros to death but you know shit changed
Can't wait to see the day that we all made it

[Chorus: YFN Lucci]
When there's a will better know there's a way, hey
Time to separate the real from the fake, uh
Nigga tryna take mine, he gon' have to pay, yeah
Tryna play with mine, better plan a wake, uh
Better play it safe
Whole lot of sticks slidin' on the interstate
You know we can't be worryin' 'bout what they gon' say
You know we can't be worried, everybody gon' hate
A whole lot of hate, where the love at, yeah, hey
I knew that one day I would get saved
I knew that one day I would get paid
Now I'ma ball on 'em like Dikembe, hey
Where there's a will, no nigga there's a way
I guess it's time to separate the real from the fake
A nigga tryna take mine, he gon' have to pay
A nigga tryna play with mine, he better plan a wake, oh, oh

[Verse 2: YFN Lucci]
Uh, long nights on that corner
Huh, big dice game, I used to strike on that corner
Yeah, big bank, but that ain't the only thing we got on us
Yeah, peep game, we only got love for the money, uh
In this game if you ain't turn nothin' to somethin'
Then you hustlin' for nothin', I came up off an onion
A whole lot of situations turned me to a monster
I had to sit and be patient but I remained humble
I always knew that I would make it
I'm street smart plus I'm educated
I worked hard plus I never hated
It hurt me hard when they took my baby
We was in the basement but we ain't never say shit
A whole lot of miscommunications
A whole lot of fake love, what have you done lately?
Before I came up you never told me I would make it
But I knew that one day I would make it, uh, yeah

[Chorus: YFN Lucci]
When there's a will better know there's a way, hey
Time to separate the real from the fake, uh
Nigga tryna take mine, he gon' have to pay, yeah
Tryna play with mine, better plan a wake, uh
Better play it safe
Whole lot of sticks slidin' on the interstate
You know we can't be worryin' 'bout what they gon' say
You know we can't be worried, everybody gon' hate
A whole lot of hate, where the love at, yeah, hey
I knew that one day I would get saved
I knew that one day I would get paid
Now I'ma ball on 'em like Dikembe, hey
Where there's a will, no nigga there's a way
I guess it's time to separate the real from the fake
A nigga tryna take mine, he gon' have to pay
A nigga tryna play with mine, he better plan a wake, oh, oh
When there's a will better know there's a way, hey
Time to separate the real from the fake, uh
Nigga tryna take mine, he gon' have to pay, yeah
Tryna play with mine, better plan a wake, uh
Better play it safe
Whole lot of sticks slidin' on the interstate
You know we can't be worryin' 'bout what they gon' say
You know we can't be worried, everybody gon' hate
A whole lot of hate, where the love at, yeah, hey
I knew that one day I would get saved
I knew that one day I would get paid
