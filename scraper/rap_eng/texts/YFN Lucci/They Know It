[Verse 1: Johnny Cinco]
Ha! Ok, stay down in them trenches to get money
Ok! Hustle everyday Monday to Sunday
All my niggas trying to get that money
Stay down for that paper we gone grind
If you do not grind you do not shine
So I'm grinding all the fucking time
30 on my jewels!
Grabbing on my jewels!
Bitch I'm John Papi all the time!
And I'm a real trapper
They some real cappers
Them niggas real actors
Lucci keep a bad bitch, she like Cleopatra!
Lucci keep a bad bitch, I'm over here pass her!

[Hook: Johnny Cinco}
They know it, say they fucked up and we know it!
We stay down, and they know it!
I want a Bentley truck like Floyd!
Fucked up and they know it, and they know it
Say they fucked up and we know it!
We stay down, and they know it!
My bitch badder than yours! Nigga my bitch badder than yours!
My bitch badder than yours, and she know it

[Verse 2: Lucci]
I only drink out the bottle
I never follow
Might rock Balenciagas
I got sick of Pradas
Aye, all I hit is models
Aye, this a different auto
Might rock a mink in autumn
I seen your bitch and bought her
Ok! A hunna' on my wrist, that's a house, yea
Ok! we might buy a house. Trap it out, yea!
Ok, my nigga fire, we right here
I spent five, on both ears
See that car, right there!
See that engine, in the rear!
I got choices, I got gear!
You couldn't afford, what I wear!
I'm in the air, thats a lear, yea!
Might make four this year
Might fish scale, some on sale
I ain't tryna buy 'em if it don't sell
I ain't never seen a brick that won't sell, yea, yea!
