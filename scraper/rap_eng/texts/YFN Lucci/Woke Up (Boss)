[Hook]
I woke up feelin' like a boss
Stepped in some mud wiped it off
Took a lost, then a took a lost, took some more now I'm a boss
I woke up feelin' like a boss
I might just get a nigga knocked off
Might put some paper on ya boss
It cost to be a boss, I woke up feelin' like a boss

[Verse 1]
Stayed down didn't finish school
I'm straight now probably buy a school
Dropped out I had something to do
Stack mine I had nun to prove
I'm a boss now I get shit approved
A boss nigga I make bigger moves
The boss nigga I got a vault nigga, I'ma ball on em' in some Jimmy Choo's
I want the kerosene nun else
Bailman's with no belt
Half of mill to myself
Made this shit myself
Louie V when I step
Bad bitch on my left
Walked in bought everything off the shelf
Everything I talk about I be about
Walked in with that gilzzy out
Boss nigga I took a different route
Racks in now we livin' now
Back then we couldn't figure it out
Remember back then we use to shoot it out
I learned back then they'll shift accounts
Now a nigga all boss

[Hook]
I woke up feelin' like a boss
Stepped in some mud wiped it off
Took a lost, then a took a lost, took some more now I'm a boss
I woke up feelin' like a boss
I might just get a nigga knocked off
Might put some paper on ya boss
It cost to be a boss, I woke up feelin' like a boss

[Verse 2]
Fifty thousand to a hunnit thousand
Hunnit thousand, another hunnit thousand
Whole lot of fuckin' money pilin'
Never had no fuckin' money problem
Give a fuck how you feel about me
I'm real cocky, ion't fear nobody
My cuban links got real diamonds
My ears shinin' my peers shinin'
Walked in blew a whole ninety
This Mac 10 hold a whole ninety
Had ya bitch with for the whole night
The stick with me so it's on sight
I remember them cold nights, that road life
Nigga 401, see a ford twice
I been gridin' my whole life
Walked in like a boss
To be the boss shit cost
Havin' pressure with a nigga and then when you see a nigga we don't talk
I do everything like a boss
Fucked the bih like a boss
Say we pour out this champagne everyday like a muthafuckin boss

[Hook]
I woke up feelin' like a boss
Stepped in some mud wiped it off
Took a lost, then a took a lost, took some more now I'm a boss
I woke up feelin' like a boss
I might just get a nigga knocked off
Might put some paper on ya boss
It cost to be a boss, I woke up feelin' like a boss
