[Intro]
Huh yea
Yea yea, yea

She tryna act like she don't know the game
But she already know what's up we up we up

[Verse 1: YFN Lucci]
Ok started from a dollar, turn it to a thousand
Used to rock the pradas, now that shit childish
Used to pull up in that Nissan, now I'm in that Audi
Never smoked the mid the whole room cloudy (real gas)
Thats gas and everybody got they own blunt so why pass
Ain't no pressure here, thru a thousand ones on 'em check the pressure yea
I'm on fire girl, yes he is
I'm so fly girl, yes I is
I'm finna get high, I'm on the way to the hill
My brother keep on saying we gon' make it this year
So I'mma start stuntin' and everything, I'm makin' this year

Yellow bone bad bitch, I had to bag her
Not to mention she marked up like i scratched her
I'm on fire like a match bruh, and so yea

[Verse 2: YFN Kay]
Started with them 96 pounds in the attic
Me, my brother Ick we had them pounds in the cabin
Free Friday YFN, everything free
Counting so much money it was Missy, Bo and Dee
Started with nowhere to
Go, now i’m at the 12
All them bitches used to hide me, now they kiss and tell
Used to be bricks and bell focused on them pots and scales
Now it’s paperwork, surf and turf got a yacht for sell
Photoshoot nigga this real life
Say she never seen a game, nigga she still bite
The money never left, it’s been here i just feel like
I’m tryna count a 10, you tryna fuck what it feel like (what’s on ya mind)
Them long folks road trips undercover
I’m thankful for the lord they ain’t snatch my brother, and about my brother i kidnap your brother, all i see is no other all we got is each other (YFN nigga)

Uh, is it me or niggas lame?

Thousand dollar shades, call it played
All my niggas made, hit em in the head for me and you get a raise
Told her get my man head, and she get the Jay’s
Swear we passed the bitch like we all be getting ate
But i be with them B’s (blat) , my niggas get the shooting you telling like little seed
And i be playing with the bread just like little seed, this ain’t make believe
