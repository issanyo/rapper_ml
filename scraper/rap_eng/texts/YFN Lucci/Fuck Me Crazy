(Never too much, never too much, never too much
Never too much, too much, too much)

[Chorus: Yung Bleu & YFN Lucci]
Don't talk, just fuck me crazy
Don't talk, just fuck me crazy
Never treat you like no basic
Never treat you like no basic
You know our love came
She makin' love, she makin' love, she makin' love faces
Don't talk, just fuck me crazy
Don't talk, just fuck me crazy
Never treat you like no basic
Never treat you like no basic
You know our love came, hey
She makin' love, she makin' love, she makin' love faces

[Post-Chorus: Yung Bleu & YFN Lucci]
Ain't no conversation, that lil pussy got me racin'
Fuck me in the car, look back to see the kinky spaceship
Put that ass on me, I'm tryna fuck you in rotation
Ooh, just fuck me crazy
Never too much talkin', I want head soon as I walk in, yeah
I can't go raw in ,fuck me like I'm your man
