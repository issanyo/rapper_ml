[Intro: Jim Jones]
There's only one Dipset
Young fly niggas 'bout cash, right
I feel that vibe
Gangsta shit

[Chorus: YFN Lucci]
Gotta play the game how it goes, every time
Never ever change on my bros, they stay down
I'ma be the same 'til I'm gone, (?)
I won't go to sleep if I'm broke
Ah hell nah, (?) how it goes
Round here, gotta play the game how it goes
I won't go to sleep if I'm broke
Ah damn right yeah, yeah

[Verse 1: Jim Jones]
Jones!
Ain't no sleep for the weary, na
Not a G to compare me
Keep them haters around me, facts
You can't even get near me, what's up?
Spent nights in the Bando, right
I would sleep with my jewelry
Had to start facing trial, had to start picking juries
So I know all about, being broke with your last
Gotta (?) of jewelry (?) buying that (?) was your last
Wish this one last forever, but we know it won't last
Me and the bros gon ride, even though we gon crash
They told me slow down, I was going so fast
Now we pullin out aces, for all them bros in the past
We still pay the rules, not a falt getting passed?
If we catch your ass slippin, bitch, you know we gon' blast!

[Chorus: YFN Lucci]
Gotta play the game how it goes, every time
Never ever change on my bros, they stay down
I'ma be the same 'til I'm gone, (?)
I won't go to sleep if I'm broke
Ah hell nah, (?) how it goes
Round here, gotta play the game how it goes
I won't go to sleep if I'm broke
Ah damn right yeah, yeah

[Verse 2: YFN Lucci]
Won't go to sleep if I'm broke, I won't beef 'bout no ho
There was times I couldn't eat, you wouldn't believe we were poor
(?) help me get my first thousand, better believe I got more
And you can make it out the projects, you gotta dream a lil more
Never let yo hand get exposed, they hate when you got doe
That's when they envy the most, they play with me, they gon' go
Something like Mad Max, nigga when that bag low
If you ain't tryna die, we gon need everything we asked for
I can't make this up about the family, I'm gon' blast somethin'
I came up from nothin, nigga, (?) at your grandson
Hold that boy for ransom
How the hell the man run
You know what we came from, you know what we came from

[Chorus: YFN Lucci]
Gotta play the game how it goes, every time
Never ever change on my bros, they stay down
I'ma be the same 'til I'm gone, (?)
I won't go to sleep if I'm broke
Ah hell nah, (?) how it goes
Round here, gotta play the game how it goes
I won't go to sleep if I'm broke
Ah damn right yeah, yeah
