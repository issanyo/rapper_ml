I told my girl keep that crack up in dat pussy

My momma told me to keep my grass cut
Cuz these niggas so cricket
Gotta watch out for these crickets

Momma told me to go in
Thanks for the permission

A real menace for them benjis
Youll stave for it
A real plumber with the pipe

And they say life is short and we ain't even midgets
They say slow down you moving to fast

Cuz i live life to the fullest
