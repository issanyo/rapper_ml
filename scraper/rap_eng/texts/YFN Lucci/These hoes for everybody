[ verse 1 : khaotic ]

My dawg hit me up
Having problems with a bitch
I told that nigga man fuck em  bruh these hoes ain't shit
All they wanna do is chase a nigga with some paper
When it ain't nomo paper they looking fo mo paper
I ain't trynna listen to these hoes and they lies
When they think you the shit they surround you like flies
A bitch is the last thing on a nigga mind
If you let a bitch do it shell take you off yo grind
I ain't finna let a bitch stop my shine
Baby you can get yours ima always get mines
I ain't trynna be the nigga living in the blind
Knowing I gotta nickel acting like I got a dime


[ Chorus ]
These hoes for everybody , they for everybody
These hoes for everybody , they for everybody
I can't wife no strone , can't trust no bitch
All a nigga know Is im trynna get rich
And these hoes for everybody
They for everybody they for everybody

[ verse 3 : khaotic ]

Some niggas let hoes throw em off they game
I don see pussy send a nigga to the chain gang

These pro section hoes done fucked my trust up
Got a nigga fucked up not knowing whats what
Shell do some strange things for a little piece a change
Fuck her main nigga then fuck his main main
I ain't trynna be the nigga living in a blind
Knowing I got a nickel acting like I got a dime

[ Chorus ]

I can't wife no strone , can't trust no bitch
All a nigga know Is im trynna get rich
