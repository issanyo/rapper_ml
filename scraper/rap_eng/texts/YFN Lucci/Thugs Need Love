[Intro: Yung Bleu]
Yeah yeah yeah yeah

[Chorus: Yung Bleu]
I'm just a thug, I need love just like anyone else
I'm just a thug, I need love just like anyone else
I'm just a thug, I'm just a thug, I'm just a thug
I'm just a thug, I need love just like anyone else

[Verse 1: Yung Bleu]
I need you like you need me, don't just think 'cause I'm a thug
That I ain't got no feelings, you know thugs need love
You know how to make me beg for it, that pussy tight
Stack that cake up every night just to get that bread right
You shinin' like some headlights
Ooh, I want to thank you
For holdin' me down when shit get rough and it get gangster
You fuckin' with a gangster (gangster, real shit)
I let her hold the banger, she thought I was just a singer
You ain't fuckin' with no actor

[Chorus: Yung Bleu]
I'm just a thug, I need love just like anyone else
I'm just a thug, I need love just like anyone else
I'm just a thug, I'm just a thug, I'm just a thug
I'm just a thug, I need love just like anyone else
(Tell me now, do you need my love?)

[Verse 2: YFN Lucci]
See I need love like you need love
A hug like you need hugs
What you want girl? speak up
Ain't no pressure girl, we up
And look we up, higher than a jet
I must admit girl you is flyer than a pilot on this jet
So I put diamonds on her neck, yeah
This is perfect timing, I was trying
I was searchin' for a lot that I wouldn't find, but now I found it
I been searchin' for my girl and now I found her
I like bein' around her, I'ma hold her down, oh yeah-yeah

[Chorus: Yung Bleu]
I'm just a thug, I need love just like anyone else
I'm just a thug, I need love just like anyone else
I'm just a thug, I'm just a thug, I'm just a thug
I'm just a thug, I need love just like anyone else
(Tell me now, do you need my love?)

[Verse 3: Yung Bleu]
Crazy how that money turn you on
I'm just tryna turn you on, that bitch stay blowin' up my phone
You talkin' like you had it with my shit
But I'm a thug, I'm on the block
Don't be embarrassing and shit, I put some karats on your wrist
Just for the fuck of it, I ain't talkin' 'bout no marriages and shit
But you fuckin' up my shit, hah
How you gon' test me when you know I'm thug?
How you gon' test me when you know I love you?
You know I love you

[Chorus: Yung Bleu]
I'm just a thug, I need love just like anyone else
I'm just a thug, I need love just like anyone else
I'm just a thug, I'm just a thug, I'm just a thug
I'm just a thug, I need love just like anyone else
