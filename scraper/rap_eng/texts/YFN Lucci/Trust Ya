[Intro]
Never ever have no love for you suckas
Never ever have no love for you suckas
Yeah, [?]
Aw, aw

[Verse 1]
We ain't never ever have no love for you suckas
Let a nigga play got it bad as they usher
Talk about my bet, how the hell can I trust ya
Dead before dishonor, I never leave my brother
Mozzy with me nigga one up top to ya cantaloupe
Now we get it 'bouta band use the envelope
My cent first day, I put you in the scope
Man down god damn, I think he finna go
Bet he nigga hella broke
Watch out, nigga act when you tell him no
It ain't 'bout what being where I'm 'bout to go
I got haters all the way in Sacramento
I be damned if I let a nigga handle me
I'm not a child, huh buck watch a nick smile
New forty cal and it came with surround sound
Nigga I'm the king pussy boy you better bow down
I be getting money like a mofucka
Tryna double up trouble up
If a nigga play, we gon flip em
Damn, he survived now he paralyzed cripple
Scared to take the trip so I guess you gotta ship em
Uh!
Big shootout in the daytime
Call em down band hit em while eight time
And nigga everywhere I keep mine
Where I'm from shit like that happen every night

[Chorus]
We ain't really have no love for no other
Imma real dog I 'on really trust ya
You know a nigga can't stand undercover
Can't stand naw no caught ya suckas
Tell me when to laugh, tell me niggas ever touch the brick
Yall niggas, I 'on waitin' for the sucka shit
No, we the wrong one to be fuckin with
Take a slug nigga get stuck with it

[Verse 2]
We ain't never had to take a trip to the neck
High tech coating on the bullets in the tec
High tech coated on the woods till its wet
Body gotta jig on the flesh
Four finger banger when I push to the deck
Pussy ass bitches get pushed to the left
Apprehended by the law, tell me look the left
Love for the looks
They be pushin' to the left
On my rack on the right
Get a bag every night
Comin' through this that they had on my life
Snatch a nigga ice, he ain't have it alright
Double back told me it was back in on sight
Fuckers gettin' for, we be wackin' on dice
Fuck the suckas side, had to wack it out twice
My nigga dinner faded when they get a boy life
Band days couldn't save that boy life

[Chorus]
We ain't really have no love for no other
Imma real dog Ion really trust ya
You know a nigga can't stand undercover
Can't stand naw no caught ya suckas
Tell me when to laugh, tell me niggas ever touch the brick
Yall niggas, Ion waitin' for the sucka shit
No, we the wrong one to be fuckin with
Take a slug nigga get stuck with it
