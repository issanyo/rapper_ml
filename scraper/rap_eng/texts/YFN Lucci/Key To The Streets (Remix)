Lit like an electric eel, fat rims, anorexic wheels
I got the key to the streets on my key chain
Like jang-a-lang, jang-a-lang
Niggas namin' names, doin' anything for a famous name
And these hoes the same
We were supposed to change since Dr. King
We shall overcome, we never overcame
I take over the game, and if you think it's a game
Then it's all about the final score of the game
I put my woe in the game, I put my ho on the 'caine, now we fuck more
Gave my daughter the game, niggas all the same
And I done broke every heart but yours
I just pulled off from the gun store
And the Azure was something that'll make you tuck yours
I got the keys to the streets
But I don't need nothing but my feet for your front door
Lil' daddy cause I'm Illmatic, I'm still at it
Now she lookin' at it, now she lookin' at me
Fly her to Miami, now the bitch tannin', now she lookin' khaki
I'm lookin' for it, purple Actav', I'ma sip it like a Virgin Daiquiri
In Cuba with my nigga Dirty Harry
Walk a fine line with sturdy banisters
Got birdies landin', got murderers handy, I'ma take a power nap
Cause I done got so comfy in the trap, I forgot I rap
Plus I'm on so much shit my insides feelin' like a lava lamp
Anybody trip, collar flap
You better tighten your bottle cap, little nigga
