[Intro: Lightshow]
She look like Barbie I ain't no Ken though, ya know
She look like Barbie I ain't no Ken though

[Hook: Lightshow]
She look like Barbie I ain't no Ken though, I smoke good marley with all my kinfolk
I got a bag but bro I done been broke, man fuck yo badge I ain't got no info
I went to jail for the shit I didn't know, still buy them bales from ya if your ticket low
Same clothes all week get the dough get the dough, in the snow in the cold get the dough

[Verse 1: Lightshow]
I feel like 12 watchin' something tell me 12 listenin', know you niggas hating I don't do no well wishing
All these extra grams got the fucking scale trippin', trap phone going ham as soon as the mail get in
We got operations, get that dough my occupation
Ain't gotta ask the patient, send him straight to operation
I'm just navigating through these streets no fabrication, heard you coming home you beat that case congratulations
I been meditating, medicating, levitating on that medication, that good life like a celebration
I'm a hustle baby might be in heaven selling pastry, I got no words for no law just tell them place me

[Hook: Lightshow]
She look like Barbie I ain't no Ken though, I smoke good marley with all my kinfolk
I got a bag but bro I done been broke, man fuck yo badge I ain't got no info
I went to jail for the shit I didn't know, still buy them bales from ya if your ticket low
Same clothes all week get the dough get the dough, in the snow in the cold get the dough

[Verse 2: YFN Lucci]
Aye you know me, imma get the dough
Bankroll so big it don't fold, imma stay down all week the same clothes
10 toes, then get fresh like I'm bankroll
Switch up all my damn hoes, push up in a tank
I can't trust no stank hoe, lil bit ass dank smoker
I be with them damn vultures, I don't need no damn scope
They don't want no damn smoke, I'm feeling like Rambo
That [?] got my pants low, shoot you and your mans hoe
JuJu got the ammo, I'll go sit down and do some time for what I stand for, I'll go sit down and do some time for what I stand for

Same clothes all week get the dough get the dough, in the snow in the cold get the dough

[Verse 3: Lightshow]
She look like Barbie I ain't no Ken though
I got a fully auto in a trench coat
Put hands on niggas like miss fuckin' Trunchbull
Ain't stressing none we gone eat if its slow, its ok
Aye and we got whole plates, we got whole plates
Send them straight to your door nigga no way
I ain't up two four I'm up four eight
And I run up all money nigga no hate
If you don't come with every dime you could go skate
Put my lil niggas on your line it won't go straight
Cop it for the low rate, sell for the go rate
Cop it for the low rate, sell for the go rate
