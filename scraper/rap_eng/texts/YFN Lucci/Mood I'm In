[Intro: Lil Durk]
Yeah, the type of mood I'm in, I'm on some fly shit
You know what I'm sayin'?
I feel like pourin' up a pint, I'ma pour it up you know?
Durk and YFN Lucci yea yea

[Hook: Lil Durk & YFN Lucci]
I might pour a pint, that's the mood I'm in
I might fuck yo' bitch, that's the mood I'm in
Might post up in the trap, that's the mood I'm in
OD off the percs, that's the mood I'm in
I just put some water on my wrist so you can swim
I just might go Cartier for the rest of the year
Walk around like a ATM, 10 cash in my ear, 20 grand for the Pair
Yea yea

[Verse 1: Lil Durk]
Perky in my system I'ma vomit
Trap goin' crazy and they know I'm the hottest
Real gun not a emoji never shoot at comments
Six of Hi tech in my cup it's never Watson (yeah)
Tell them niggas (pay up)
Day before the first day of school I used to stay up
Dub bank allowed I was tryna get my J's up
Shot my nigga Boonie he ain't want give his J's up
I've been feeling moody lately, come give me that coochie baby
Me and bro 'nem too related, never been a groupie hater
Think I'm Fetty Wap in Chiraq, it's a zoovie baby
The way I beat that pussy Kevin Gates, they gon' sue me baby
(Let's get it!)

[Hook: Lil Durk & YFN Lucci]
I might pour a pint, that's the mood I'm in
I might fuck yo' bitch, that's the mood I'm in
Might post up in the trap, that's the mood I'm in
OD off the percs, that's the mood I'm in
I just put some water on my wrist so you can swim
I  just might go Cartier for the rest of the year
Walk around like a ATM, 10 cash in my ear, 20 grand for the Pair
Yea yea

[Verse 2: YFN Lucci]
Walk around with yo' car on my neck
Nigga playin' we gon' get his ass wacked
No Instagram but a nigga gotta check
Go get the money we was raised like that
Free my nigga Ape they gave him 10 years man
And Step comin' home but he can't get them years back yea
Just gave him 30 told 'em don't understand all that
I got another .30 for ya when I get back
Oh Lord knows that I'm traumatized, the look in my eyes
Lord knows we gon' terrorize every one of you guys
Lord knows we don't never hide, we don't never hide
Put you on the news, get you televised now you worldwide
