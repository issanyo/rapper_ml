Think it's a game (think it's a game)
Yeah
If it wasn't for them late nights hustling on the block trying to get it up
I don't even know where I'd be
If it wasn't for that fifteen months that I spent locked up nigga
I don't even know where I'd be
If it wasn't for the last twenty four months that I spent with nothing nigga
I don't even know where I'd be
If it wasn't for the sacrifice I knew my momma took nigga
I don't even know where I'd be
If it wasn't for momma and daddy, I swear that
I don't even know where I'd be
If it wasn't for the commas I was stacking, I swear to God
I don't even know where I'd be
If it wasn't for the Rolly I'd prolly waste time
Prolly things like black Cartiers on my eye
The money for the whips yea I spent it last night
Every day me and Lucci thank God cuh we don't know where we would be
I don't know where I'd be with out my family (my family)
And I don't give a fuck about how much money you got don't handle me
Guess what I make a nigga answer me
Broke nigga took that hoe to applebee
All my suits tailored like the pastors be
Versace everything like master p
Pull up on my niggas in the hood, then I
Smoke a couple of blunts then I pull up
No rodeo I see red like a bull I
Pull off the dancing bull
I can tell that pussy scared 'cause he soft
Funny how all my ex's what to know what I'm doing
I pull her on the side of the bed, I'm tired of hearing her moaning
Watching out for the feds riding around with nothing on me
She wanna do while me wrapped, turn the movie on Mummy
She kept the lights on while she be doing it to me
All I know I real boy see me hitting it hommie
I swear I don't know where I'd be without my hommies
Shout out Lucci

Shout out Rich Homie

Uh, I thank god we were chosen
They say never question god and I know it
But why it big nigga big had kids
Shit big one of the reasons a nigga big
Big had a heart did big
Big was my nigga till the end
Big taught me how to put it up and don't spend
Big always told me to transcend
He told me to get the front end and the back end
Then he told me most niggas pretend
And that's why I don't have friends
Just the brothers who gonna ride to the end
Forty five on my side to the end
Nigga we don't have nigga you know why we here
Look where I'm going nigga look where I've been, yea
Nigga you know what it is
Late night hustling
Trying to get my shit ripe no pear
Every single day and night I sin
But lord forgive me I'm human
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Fake card drawn, like I'm playing poker, nigga fake card drawn
And nigga when you see me better get it on short
And man I'm doing good and man I'm doing good
If it wasn't for them late nights hustling on the block
Trying to get it up
