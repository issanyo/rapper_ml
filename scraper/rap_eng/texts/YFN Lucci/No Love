[Intro: Dat Boi Skeet]
Ayy Lucci
Ain't no love man
They ain't been where we been man
They ain't seen what we seen
If it ain't 'bout no money man
Ain't no love
Ain't no love in these streets man
More money, yeah

[Chorus: YFN Lucci]
These streets got my heart cold, yeah, hey, uh
So cold, so cold, so cold, yeah hey
A bitch can't get no love from a nigga
A bitch can't get no love from a nigga, yeah hey
You know he can't get no love from a nigga
No, he can't get no love from a nigga, ayy

[Verse 1: Dat Boi Skeet]
On my mama, that's on my soul
Stand tall, no bin to fold
If I'm ridin', my niggas roll
Ain't none of mines ever told
If you need it, I got it sold
Heartless, my heart is cold
Don't try us, we lock and load
Rather rob and just get this dough
I been in these streets for a long time
Ride 'til the wheels fall, that's a long ride
I'm good in every city, state, that's on all sides
Hard times, I could depend on all mines, yeah
Headshot but I'm still breathing
God's plan, so I'm here for a real reason
Every dollar, I'ma chase it, because I need it
Fast lane, speedin'
I eat, we all eatin'

[Chorus: YFN Lucci]
These streets got my heart cold, yeah, hey, uh
So cold, so cold, so cold, yeah hey
A bitch can't get no love from a nigga
A bitch can't get no love from a nigga, yeah hey
You know he can't get no love from a nigga
No, he can't get no love from a nigga, ayy

[Verse 2: YFN Lucci]
These niggas soundin' like me, but they bars not addin' up
Yeah they stories sound good but they scars not matchin' up
See them boys be actin' tough, Valentine Massacre
My boys'll come after you, they got the boss out his character, yeah
True story, a nigga play, we get him gone, that's a true story
See I know what we done done and what they gon' do for me
A whole lot of guns and that's a true story, yeah, uh
So we ain't cut from the same cloth
You better duck when I aim boy
I put some bucks on your main boy
I got a whole lot of anger
So I know we ain't sparin' no one
And I mean no one, yeah, uh

[Chorus: YFN Lucci]
These streets got my heart cold, yeah, hey, uh
So cold, so cold, so cold, yeah hey
A bitch can't get no love from a nigga
A bitch can't get no love from a nigga, yeah hey
You know he can't get no love from a nigga
No, he can't get no love from a nigga, ayy

[Outro: YFN Lucci]
Yeah, hey, uh
Yeah, hey
