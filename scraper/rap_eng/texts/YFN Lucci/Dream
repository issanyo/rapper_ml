[Verse 1]
I ain't ever had no handouts niggas always talmbout what they gave me, yeah nigga talkin' like they made me yeah, nigga talkin' real crazy
Uh what they sayin won't break me, all this pain it won't phase me
I was tryna get a brick filled with brick turned a forty to a eight Love verse hate nigga, why these nigga love hatin' on a nigga
But we gon show love to a fake nigga and keep countin' up on a fake nigga
This for all my thug too much cake ain't enough
Ima need like four plugs, you know
Ima hustle like eight squads and that way before I knew what a check was
Back then we used to use the backdoor bitch ain't even know where the trap was
I bet you I can get a hit off for sure I ain't ever been this lit up before
I get up get fresh like I live in a store
I just got a deal might put it on the board
They told me I would lose they told me I would not be shit and I still did me and I won
Still keep it one hun dun I was tryna get a long sum
I ain't take shit from no one
Yeah we gon make it we gon overcome
We gon take it like them nigga owed it to us, no more pacin' yeah you know we coming for it

[Chorus]
This can't be love, do you care if I make if or if I don't
They told me I won't, they told me I won't
They told me I would lose and then I won
And you know life isn't hard as we make it seem yeah
And though we think impossible you can achieve
We know it ain't promised or guaranteed yeah
But everyone got a dream

[Verse 2]
You know how many franks I get nigga
How them late nights and early mornings, you know how many banks I hit nigga
Late nights still here recording and this the thanks I get nigga
Pay cuts for all of that touring and this the thanks I get nigga
Who gon grind like me who gon outshine who gon shine like me
Tote the nine and pour lines like me
Ain't nobody gon come find me
I was in my prime when I was nineteen
Smokin' down and my eyes Chinese
Lay 'em down we want every damn thing
I was taught to go and chase your dream
I was taught to go and chase your dream
I was told to never wait for a thing
I was broke so I prayed for everything
We got more white than KKK
I be havin', seen like eight J pay
I just wanna see my niggas straight
Wanna see em wit a bigger plate
We just want those better days

[Chorus]
Can't be love, do you care if I make it or if I don't
They told me I won't, they told me I won't
They told me I would lose and then I won
And you know life isn't hard as we make it seem yeah
And though we think impossible you can achieve
We know it ain't promised or ain't guaranteed yeah
But everyone got a dream
