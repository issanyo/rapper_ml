[Hook: YFN Lucci]
See this exactly how it was
We was up, hoe we was up yeah
Then somehow this shit got rough yeah, should I give up, I can't give up nah
Man I swear I can't make this up yeah, I can feel it in the air
When shit was real you wasn't there hey, and they talkin' 'bout I switched up yeah
See I was real like everywhere, they know it's real when I'm in there yeah yeah

[Verse 1: YFN Lucci]
A lot of pain in my heart, a lot of scars I'm so scarred
If I start I'ma finish, gotta finish what I start
See I was young I ain't listen, they told me don't I still did it
See I was chasin' after money, I had a lot of ambitions
See my intentions was to get it yeah, hate losin' gotta start winnin'
Hustle hard every minute hey, I swear I'm so relentless yeah
Time wait for no man now, I'ma man now (ok)
Never sent momma nowhere but I can now (ok)
Got some family out in Jamaica we might land there
Bought a house with a lot of acres look where we stayin' now (ok)
Okay, hard body never tell it, bitches love my image (ok)
From the heart I spit it, thank God I'm different yeah

[Hook: YFN Lucci]
See this exactly how it was
We was up, hoe we was up yeah
Then somehow this shit got rough yeah, should I give up, I can't give up nah
Man I swear I can't make this up yeah, I can feel it in the air
When shit was real you wasn't there hey, and they talkin' 'bout I switched up yeah
See I was real like everywhere, they know it's real when I'm in there yeah yeah

[Verse 2: Rich Homie Quan]
Never switched up, stayed down, the same nigga since day one
Gotta make my momma happy, I promised her I'm gon' make some
If shit get ugly me and my niggas gon' take some
Nudie jeans, with Gucci, me and Lucci gon' shake some
Made up my mind I swear I don't wanna go to jail no more
Take her, that's fine gotta new bitch with me everywhere I go
Cartier got me blind, this real gold on my face lil' hoe
Textin' from my mind (shh) kill 'em, I can't say no more
Ride, on em' can't pay them folks, slide in her I stay in yo' hoe
You mine, denim, what you waitin' for?
I spit on that shit 'cause it don't taste that good
Oops I meant moist, suck it til' you lose your voice
Hoes know I'm the bitches choice

[Hook: YFN Lucci & Rich Homie Quan]
