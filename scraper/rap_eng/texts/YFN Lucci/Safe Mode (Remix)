[Intro: 24Heavy]
I won't ever fold, no
I won't sell my soul, no
They turned my heart cold, yeah, ah, ah

[Chorus: 24Heavy]
It's my time and I can't hold out

Play with the devil, you lose
I lost my brother in school
I was breakin' all the rules
They don't even have a clue

Fucked around and made the news

All I ever did was lose
And that's why I pour my soul out
Go the hardest, I can't hold out
I lost my brother, my heart cold now
I swear I'm in safe mode now

[Chorus: 24Heavy]
It's my time and I can't hold out
