[Intro]

[Chorus]
Aye we done been through hard times hard times hard times
We done been through hard times yeah
Aye we done been through hard times hard times hard times
We done been through hard times yeah
I lost my brother and it turned me to a savage yeah
I swear I never leave the house without that automatic
I put that money over bitches Ima chase a sack
I gotta plug cross the water he gon get it back yeah uh uh uh

[Verse 1]
Sittin' at the table where we count racks and bust down packs
We got AK, we got thirties, we got macks
Niggas say he want some problems and they know where we at
You know too much of that ra ra shit'll get you wack
Aye you know once you go to heaven ain't no coming back
Once you cross that line ain't no coming back
Once you drop a dime you become a rat
Can't keep giving these bitches my time I swear I'm done with that
Time I start puttin' niggas in line like the stores packed
Know that I can't go back
We were raised in a area where there was no hope at
Aye we don't play we will come and shoot up where your folks at
Post up where you serve at you won't get this curb back

[Chorus]
Aye we done been through hard times hard times hard times
We done been through hard times yeah
Aye we done been through hard times hard times hard times
We done been through hard times yeah
I lost my brother and it turned me to a savage yeah
I swear I never leave the house without that automatic
I put that money over bitches Ima chase a sack
I gotta plug cross the water he gon get it back yeah uh uh uh

[Verse 2]
Okay lil' snakes in the grass gotta watch my step yeah
Never come in last never ever ever yeah
All these gold chains feel like gold medals
Do you know how it feel to be broke nigga
Aye do you know yeah, aye do you know I got some niggas down the road yeah
Aye do you know I had to get it out the road yeah
I'm talkin' back to back, back to back shows hey
Back to back back to back jokes and I will never let a nigga hoe me
I was at the clear port in some gym shorts, put the Drake's on 'fore we board, yeah uh

[Chorus]
Aye we done been through hard times hard times hard times
We done been through hard times yeah
Aye we done been through hard times hard times hard times
We done been through hard times yeah

I swear I never leave the house without that automatic
I put that money over bitches Ima chase a sack
I gotta plug cross the water he gon get it back yeah uh uh uh
