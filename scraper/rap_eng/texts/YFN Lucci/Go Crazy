[Chorus]
Yeah hey hey
Uh, too many fake niggas out here, what the world coming too, yeah
Too many fake bosses, lil' nigga speak when spoken too, yeah
I've been fighting demons lately swear y'all don't know what I've been goin' through, yeah
Uh huh, woah yeah
Uh, now a nigga fed up
You know every dollar add up
I can't afford to let up, so I can't afford to fuck up
Yeah hey hey, I can't uh huh

[Verse]
Yeah, I been hated, I been loved, I been lied to
Yeah, I been holdin' in that pain swear I been tryin' to
Yeah, I done seen shit in the game that I was blind to
Yeah, and that's one reason why I ever don't want to sign too
Hey uh, two cups and a blunt, these are Saint Laurent
Second mixtape got me a number one, I already got another one Plus I'm workin' on another one, just got a new watch and get my brother one
I love my nigga like my mother's son, I know they love what I've become

Cooked the dope in a tea kettle, when we was down nigga you ain't help us
Now I'm up and I can't help ya (I can't help ya)

[Chorus]
Yeah hey hey
Uh, too many fake niggas out here, what the world coming too, yeah
Too many fake bosses, lil' nigga speak when spoken too, yeah
I've been fighting demons lately swear y'all don't know what I've been goin' through, yeah
Uh huh, woah yeah
Uh, now a nigga fed up
You know every dollar add up
I can't afford to let up, so I can't afford to fuck up
Yeah hey hey, I can't, uh huh
