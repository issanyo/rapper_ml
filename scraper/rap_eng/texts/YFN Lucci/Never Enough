[Verse 1]
A whole lot on my brain
Too much pressure and pain
I waited all day and it ain't came
Too much on me how I can't complain
I ain’t got a dollar to my name, huh
I ain’t got a dollar to my name
I was walking in and out the bank
I always chose money over fame
I was trapping hours for them thangs
I was tryna eat I knew I had some weight to gain, yeah
Made it, jumped off the porch as a baby
Swear we made it, we escaped it, I am not a Grady baby
I’m related to the paper, I am not an eighty baby
I'm a Georgia bastard baby, I don't mind gettin' you ate
I don't mind gettin' you ate
I got some young niggas hungry down for a plate
I got some young niggas tryna line up a play
I got some young niggas on my line every time if you play, yeah

[Chorus]
Be patient my dawg, sometimes you just gotta wait 'til it come
Making my play, I ain’t praying for much
Taking my chances, we're never too much, never too much
Never give up, who would’ve thought it was never enough
Who would’ve thought it was never enough
Who would’ve thought it was never enough, hey hey yeah

[Post-Chorus]
Hey
Yeah, yeah, hey, hey
Yeah yeah yeah, yeah yeah, yeah
Who would’ve thought it was never enough
Who would’ve thought it was never enough
Yeah, uh

[Verse 2]
Ok hustle to that bag
Hustle, yeah I hustle like my dad
I come from where them young niggas got gats
I come from doing bad
See I was once there out in the back
I never seen my partner doing that
Uh, tell me why the fuck you would do that?
I’m used to spending bands, yeah I'm good at doing that
Don’t make me spend a ten just to get your ass whacked
And we gon' spin again, man you know we coming back, uh, yeah
Ayy, from a crumb to the riches, in the slum and the trenches
Put a bomb on them bitches, where you from lil nigga? yeah
Ayy where you from lil nigga, yeah
Ayy they gon' make me let my young nigga get 'em, young nigga
I been poppin since a young nigga
Money old but I'm thuggin' like a young nigga
Yeah, still thuggin' like a young nigga, yeah, yeah
Okay we waited, look how long we waited
Told me stop that drankin', too much medication
They told me be patient, uh, I been sitting here thinkin'
Bring me back his pinky, I just want some strainin'
You wouldn’t know what pain is, why the fuck you came here?
Who the fuck you came with?
Uh, when you know we stain shit but we never claim it
Uh, keep playing, we gon' make you famous, yeah, uh
Be patient my dawg,  be patient my dawg, be patient my dawg
You know it's times you can't never give up
And know too much time just ain't never enough
Ain't never enough, ain't never enough
Never give up, don't put your faith in what you cannot trust
Don't you know diamonds was found in the mud
Don't you know that I just climbed out the mud, yeah

[Chorus]
Be patient my dawg, sometimes you just gotta wait 'til it come
Making my play, I ain’t praying for much
Taking my chances, we're never too much, never too much
Never give up, who would’ve thought it was never enough
Who would’ve thought it was never enough
Who would’ve thought it was never enough, hey hey yeah

[Post-Chorus]
Hey
Yeah, yeah, hey, hey
Yeah yeah yeah, yeah yeah, yeah
Who would’ve thought it was never enough
Who would’ve thought it was never enough
Yeah, uh

[Outro]
Okay look, hustle to that bag
Hustle, yeah I hustle like my dad
I come from where them young niggas got gats
Okay look, hustle to that bag
Hustle, yeah I hustle like my dad
I come from where them young niggas got gats
You know, you just gotta be real
You know some people ain't real, you know, it hard in the game
But you just be yourself, and you gon', you gon' be good
You made it through the street, you gon' make it through this
