[Intro: Marlo]
I was sittin' in the trenches with my niggas
And I know them niggas gon' ride until the wheels fall off 'cause them my dogs
And I'll knock one of y'all niggas off about my dog
So when you see them in the street know them my dogs
Ride 'til the wheels fall off (ride 'til the wheels fall off)

[Chorus: Marlo]
I was sittin' in the trenches with my niggas
And I know them niggas gon' ride until the wheels fall off 'cause them my dogs
And I'll knock one of y'all niggas off about my dog
So when you see them in the street know them my dogs
Ain't playin' with these niggas, we shot callin'
Big ballin', nigga we ball like Spalding
We ain't playin' with no opps, we straight off 'em
And a nigga get straight to the business
I ran up a milly off a pretty penny
And I dropped down to my knees and thanked God we really winnin'
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah

[Verse 1: Marlo]
PFK be the realest, no switching up
And I ain't need no lucky charm 'cause I had luck
Really slapped mine on these niggas, I'm havin' that fetty
We don't do no drive-by, nigga we walk up and get it
If Thug send the word, he know I'ma go and get it, yeah
Sellin' them bags of midget
Bro I'm sellin' that gas, no really, yeah
And Melly sittin' in them trenches
I pull up the Bentley, right in the trenches
I told him straight up that he the realest
And he the realest, I really did it
I sold a thousand pounds of midget in the kitchen
I really did it, yeah

[Chorus: Marlo]
I was sittin' in the trenches with my niggas
And I know them niggas gon' ride until the wheels fall off 'cause them my dogs
And I'll knock one of y'all niggas off about my dog
So when you see them in the street know them my dogs
Ain't playin' with these niggas, we shot callin'
Big ballin', nigga we ball like Spalding
We ain't playin' with no opps, we straight off 'em
And a nigga get straight to the business
I ran up a milly off a pretty penny
And I dropped down to my knees and thanked God we really winnin'
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah

[Verse 2: Offset]
Gang authentic (gang)
Head of my gang, lieutenant (hey)
Straight from the Nawf, tryna get it (Nawf)
Three young niggas, yeah we winnin' (woo, woo)
Remember when the back end wasn't that big but a nigga had to split it (we had to split it)
Murk in the feds, got caught with a SIG and it cost two-fifty (quarter ticket)
Ain't no switchin'
Them my dogs, they bite, they vicious (urr, urr)
Private jet with the revolver, stay on my pivot (bah bah bah)
Pray to God 'cause I can't get caught with this pistol (no)
Big boy missiles (missiles)
Niggas trained to kill when I whistle (hey)

[Verse 3: YFN Lucci]
Big ball, big ballin'
I'ma big dog, lil doggy
Your bitch can't keep her lips off me
I just can't see myself fallin'
Can't see myself fallin'
I'ma ball like I'm James Harden
Ball like my name Jordan
Balmain jeans on me
Uh, I'ma put some change on me
You ain't gon' never see where it came from
You ain't gon' never say where I can't come
You ain't gon' never ever flame nothin'
Uh, I'ma be the same one
I ain't gon' never ever change nothin'
I ain't gon' never give the game up
We won't let the money change us

[Chorus: Marlo]
I was sittin' in the trenches with my niggas
And I know them niggas gon' ride until the wheels fall off 'cause them my dogs
And I'll knock one of y'all niggas off about my dog
So when you see them in the street know them my dogs
Ain't playin' with these niggas, we shot callin'
Big ballin', nigga we ball like Spalding
We ain't playin' with no opps, we straight off 'em
And a nigga get straight to the business
I ran up a milly off a pretty penny
And I dropped down to my knees and thanked God we really winnin'
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah
