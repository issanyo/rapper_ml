[Verse 1: YFN Lucci]
Look, you ain't never ever had no gun to tote
Long as we got lungs, we gon’ smoke
Long as my nigga call, we on go
Better not fall for no ho, yeah
Whole lotta guns, ain't no roses
Know my nigga share like DeRozan
I can get you whacked and y'all know it
We don’t fuck with rats and y'all rodents
We gon' get that pack and unload it
You know I got them racks you can't fold it
You know I walked in with it on me
You know I can't pretend to be phony, no way, yeah
I walked in feeling like OJ, yeah, I cut a bitch off like OJ, yeah
I made a way when they told me it was no way, yeah
I put my whole right hand on it, if I said it, I'ma stand on it, yeah
I'm lil' but I’m big homie, yeah, I’m lil' but I’m big homie
I put the guap on you and your homies, damn
Cross me a block if I want 'em to, yeah

[Chorus: YFN Lucci]
Uh, this not your regular whip
I'm not your regular pimp, I'm far from regular
This not your regular whip, yeah
I’m not your regular pimp, yeah
That money got me with a limp
That money make me walk with a limp, yeah, hey
That money got me with a limp
That money make me walk with a limp, yeah, yeah
This not your regular clip, this not your regular clip, yeah
Clip hold fifty in here, I got a whole fifty in here
I got a whole fifty in here, yeah
Shit make me walk with a limp, yeah
Clip make me walk with a limp, yeah
Shit make me walk with a limp, yeah

[Verse 2: Mozzy]
They know that I'm fourth and--
Tell Glizzy we need an endorsement
The twenty-three on me, important
One in the four, they scorin' like Jordan
The hooker just got an abortion
Probably the reason she all in her feelings
I ain't get jumped in the gang
I jump niggas in, then mould them to killers
We hold up the signal, they killing for kibbles
Vehicle riddled for playing the middle
Word to my mama, I stay with the sizzle
They know my gangster official, official
Brett did a nickel, he back on the bricks
Now it's the Rollie to shackle the wrists
Considered a felon for cracking them sticks
Help my lil' sister with half on the rent
Help my lil' brother, went half on a kid
Made it from nothing, ain't asking for shit
No fifty-fifty or half with a bitch
My jewelry from Benny, don't ask me again
A, M, and G on the back of the Benz
After we park it, we backing it in
That's how we live, is what it is
Ready whenever shit get out of hand, yeah

[Chorus: YFN Lucci]
Uh, this not your regular whip
I'm not your regular pimp, I'm far from regular
This not your regular whip, yeah
I'm not your regular pimp, yeah
That money got me with a limp
That money make me walk with a limp, yeah, hey
That money got me with a limp
That money make me walk with a limp, yeah, yeah
This not your regular clip, this not your regular clip, yeah
Clip hold fifty in here, I got a whole fifty in here
I got a whole fifty in here, yeah
Shit make me walk with a limp, yeah
Clip make me walk with a limp, yeah
Shit make me walk with a limp, yeah

[Outro: YFN Lucci]
Yeah, clip hold fifty in here, I got a whole fifty in here
Yeah, clip make me walk with a limp, yeah
Shit make me walk with a limp, yeah
