[Intro: YFN Lucci]
Gotta get paid, hey
Gotta get paid, I gotta get paid

[Verse 1: FatBoy SSE]
I got the chopper on my hip if you disrespect
I got that work up in the street if you want the pressure
If you want the pressure, I might give it to you quick
And my gang know I will never ever switch (I love my niggas)
And I never been a bitch, stayed ten toes (Stayed ten toes)
Got hoes in my DM's, call 'em bimbos (Fuck with me)
I remember in the hood used to get low
Now we in LA, I swear I get dough (I swear I get it)
Wait, you can't guard this shit (You can't guard me)
I just took off like a rocket, James Harden, bitch
And I came from the grind, that mean I'm hard as shit (I'm hard as ever)
And I blossom like a flower, I just harvest it (I just harvest it)
Blowin' fire quick, nigga I'm an arsonist (I'm an arsonist)
I don't care about this Rollie, I might auction it (I might auction it)
All I care about is family, that's my heart and shit (I love 'em)
You don't know about the grind
You ain't work like this (You ain't work like this)
You don't know about the grind
You don't work like this (You ain't work like this)
You don't know about the grind
You don't work like this, nigga (You ain't work like this)
You ain't work like this
I know I did, you ain't work like this

[Chorus: FatBoy SSE]
I've been up for twelve days, gotta get paid
Coolin' in the shade with a bad lil' bad mami (Mami)
And you niggas sweet like some lemonade (Lemonade)
I'm my own boss, I call my own raise (Own raise)
Gotta get paid, gotta get paid, yeah (Gotta get paid)
I gotta get paid, gotta get paid, yeah (Gotta get paid)
I gotta get paid, gotta get paid, yeah (Gotta get paid)
I gotta get paid, gotta get paid (Gotta get paid)

[Verse 2: YFN Lucci]
I gotta get paid right
I'm a boss, on my stomach, I tatted, "Thug Life," huh
My shit official and I'm flyer than a plane, right
And I'm a hustler, I get dollars on a rainy night
I'm out in Jersey with FatBoy on one of they coldest night, go an' roll the dice
I just hit him when they froze the ice, yeah
I seen my main man get rich, that's why I chose this life, yeah
I gave a plain jane to a bitch and she ain't know the type, yeah
I been up twelve days
I ain't had sleep, I used to dream that I would end up paid
I ain't had shit, I had a bitch and she had selfish ways
I ain't never care what no one else would say
I ain't have no problem when it come to gettin' paid

[Chorus: FatBoy SSE]
I've been up for twelve days, gotta get paid
Coolin' in the shade with a bad lil' bad mami (Mami)
And you niggas sweet like some lemonade (Lemonade)
I'm my own boss, I call my own raise (Own raise)
Gotta get paid, gotta get paid, yeah (Gotta get paid)
I gotta get paid, gotta get paid, yeah (Gotta get paid)
I gotta get paid, gotta get paid, yeah (Gotta get paid)
I gotta get paid, gotta get paid (Gotta get paid)
