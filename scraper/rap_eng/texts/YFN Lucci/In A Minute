[Hook – YFN Lucci & Johnny Cinco]
On the road tryna get it, doing shows every city
I ain’t slept in a minute, I’m in my zone tryna win it
I ain’t fucked in a minute, girl I ain’t fucked in a minute
She all alone in the city, I’m on the road call it [?]
So many hoes [?] different, that’s just why I’m acting different
And I ain’t fucked her in a minute, I ain’t fucked her in a minute

[Verse 1 – Johnny Cinco]
We on the road for the riches
Plenty hoes, plenty bitches
Plenty walls and the trenches
All alone with the millions
I been trying so [?], [?] put away
Pouring up codeine, we ain’t running out of lean
[?] nigga say drink, it’s not what it seems
Riding round with the thing, I’m the player on the scene
Really tripping, nigga let it go
Said she love me but she really don’t
I ain’t fucked her in a while, I ain’t seen her in a while

And I ain’t fucked her in a minute, I ain’t fucked her in a minute

[Verse 2 – YFN Lucci]
On the road with these bitches
See pound told me stay consistent
I stayed down, ten toes, ten toes, ten toes
When I touched down I bought a [?] and I fucked a few hoes
Rose gold my jeezy, rose gold nigga believe me
Thumbs up and they ganging, I came through that bitch speeding
Yeah I’m fly, nigga Louis V my attire
Trying to build my power, set the streets on fire
Couple mil is a desire, bad bitches I require
I got rich before my idol, I got hits like Mark McGwire
I got bitches, I got Benjis, I got friends, I got robbers
But I need me a one nighter
