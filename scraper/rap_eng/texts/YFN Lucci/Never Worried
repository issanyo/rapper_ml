[Chorus]
You know it don't make no sense if it don't make none
And I got a lotta bitches, it ain't nothin' to replace one
Built my home, bitch, I can create one
Uh, name a bigger boss, I bet it ain't one
Hey, hey, I  don't ever worry, we ain't never worried
We ain't never worried, we ain't never worried
Never worried, we ain't never worried
Never worried, yeah

[Verse 1]
Ain't no rules in this shit
Can't keep losin' this shit
Always losin' your bitch
Gotta keep like 2 or 3 kids
See my Frank Muller it's lit
Why spend my time with a bitch?
Why sit around cryin' about a bitch?
I built me 9 of them bitches
Okay Lu', spend some bands on it
I know my mans want her
That Ben' Frank, bet a bag on her
Lu', we can drag on her, fuck up your leg
Dollar after dollar after dollar, you won't never last
Roll so much damn weed up with my feet up, we don't come in last
Ran with the best of them
Yeah, you gon' need a vest for 'em
Uh, cool like my uncle, hell yeah
We don't do the tongue wrestlin'
Young nigga, young nigga
Shit sitcks hangin' out the caravan
We gon' stack it tall as we can
I can't hear you,, nigga, what you sayin'?

[Chorus]
You know it don't make no sense if it don't make none
And I got a lotta bitches, it ain't nothin' to replace one
Built my home, bitch, I can create one
Uh, name a bigger boss, I bet it ain't one
Hey, hey, I  don't ever worry, we ain't never worried
We ain't never worried, we ain't never worried
Never worried, we ain't never worried
Never worried, yeah

[Verse 2]
I had to get up out my feelings, I got dough to be gettin'
Yeah, I got caught up in my pimpin' but it ain't your business
Told this bitch if she don't pay me, I can't pay attention
Yeah, brang me that paper or stay away from me
See a gangster like myself, I get that paper then pussy
You know we put the cake on they head, you spend your cake on some pussy
Know we be takin' from pussies, heard you be takin' the pussy
Fuck her in the Wraith, I get outer-space, yeah, we gettin' it
Like on Narcos and I'm Pablo
Yeah, we be duckin' 5-0, it's about survival
Stack that paper 'til it don't fall
Nigga stand tall, nigga, don't fall, yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
You know it don't make no sense if it don't make none
And I got a lotta bitches, it ain't nothin' to replace one
Built my home, bitch, I can create one
Uh, name a bigger boss, I bet it ain't one
Hey, hey, I  don't ever worry, we ain't never worried
We ain't never worried, we ain't never worried
Never worried, we ain't never worried
Never worried, yeah
