[Intro]
June you're a genius

You know you don't hustle you don't eat nigga
You know if you broke you don't sleep nigga
You know, long live all my niggas

[Verse 1]
Look, aye keep that Glock by my tommy
Boy you know you pussy like right beneath her lil' tummy
I am the bomb and I advise you pussies stay far from me
Nick how I come drummin'
Flow sick I might vomit
Drop a brick on they head they better not hit no stomach
All this lead in this pencil I'ma erase sum
I'm from the gutter where snitches wear wires
Ridin' with mack and I ain't talkin' bout that boy off of The Wire
Mack 11 on my side but that boy not a minor
Make me come find ya

You know that yapper bring the bitch up out him
They know a punk bitch ain't ever got shit up out him yeah

Play wit my dawg and we gon bring it to ya door like we tryna make sure you got it
I use to make the honor roll but I ain't make it through college
Aye nowadays I might push the Rolls Royce down Collins

[Chorus]
At your best, you are love yeah
Look, see we were broke I had to make sure we got it
I swear it took a long time but I still went and got it yeah
That's a boss, that's a boss yeah
