Come around here we gone lay it down
We dont like them games that they play around
Young nigga from the hood trynna make it out
Hustle on the block we in the trap house
If we got a problem my partners will round ya
Niggas left for dead until somebody come find ya
Hustle on the block we in the trap house
Hustle on the block we trynna make it out

Hustle on the block we in the trap house
Thuggin for the money so my brothers they can make it out
Snakes in the sky they trynna air us out
Blood all off in the streets
It ain't no doubt up in my mind that I can sniff it out
Choppa make em drip it out
I ain't playin with these boys
Niggas talk but they just make a lotta noise
Started out a YG
Young gunna in the street now who said they wanna play with me
If you doubt then you dead anyway
Hustle on the block until you get a lotta money
Never ever let them play you for no dummy
Niggas come around they be smillin but nothin funny
See like them boys up to something
First k im boutta start dumpin
Come around you better show yo hand
Raised in the street I learned to trust no man
I learned to trust no man

Come around here we gone lay it down
We dont like them games that they play around
Young nigga from the hood trynna make it out
Hustle on the block we in the trap house
If we got a problem my partners will round ya
Niggas left for dead until somebody come find ya
Hustle on the block we in the trap house
Hustle on the block we trynna make it out

Look first things first
We gone get paid on the 1st
Trap house jumpin like durk
Got the trap jumpin out the motherfuckin dirt
Get a pack flip a pack nigga now you workin
Better days on the way I deserve it
Yesterday told mama baby no more hurtin
When it come down to being broke Im allergic
Yeah
Truth is Im the gift and the curse man
If a nigga play we gone herse him
No trial for the gangs all the excursions
Im in my own lane working on a couple M
No time for these fuckin lames
You know Ill murder them
No we never heard of them
Thuggin like im soulja slim
Pourin juice everyday like I'm fucking Pimp
Gotta bitch with me everyday like a fuckin pimp
Nigga you gotta deuce deuce you'll fuck around
