When you getting to the money
They don't want to see you shine
Got some partners and locked away
Far Away
And every single time
They call my phone
I answer every time
Counting the days till the day
Got some pretty bitches
On the way
One night only
You know you can't stay
When you getting to the the money
They don't want to see you shine
It's okay
That's okay
