[Verse 2: Jose Guapo]
Every trap spot we in got cable
I swear we sip that syrup just like it was maple
I'm screaming fuck nah, I can't do no favors
And that's wassup dawg, I keep that shit playa
Don't give a fuck dawg, you could meet your maker
I'm rolling up dawg, I'm smoking on Jamaica
You get hit up niggas just for tryna play us
Nigga do it, drive by in a spaceship
We a hunnid deep in magic in the day shift

Let them buzzers fly, make it rain on 'em
My niggas all I got, I'd never change on 'em

[Hook]

[Verse 3: YFN Kay]
Comma,Comma,Comma still count
Killer keep that money come in runnin like a fountain
Only thing running over there is your mouth
Ride through your block with them sticks and now you out
Screaming fuck the other side, it was just a homicide
That was just how I replied
Grippin' on that 45 I'm on that 96 bullshit
Send you to the pool pit
If you mention my name send his ass a full clip
That's on 9 deuce, talking brazy I shoot
He was 6'4 but the kill took left him 5'2
When there's beef bitch it ain't no discussion
Might pack that bag have my lil niggas buss him

[Hook]
