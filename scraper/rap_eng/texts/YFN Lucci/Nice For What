[Intro: Big Freedia]
I wanna know who mothafuckin' representin' in here tonight
Hold on, hold on

[Pre-Chorus: Lauryn Hill & Drake]
I keep lettin' you back in (you back in)
How can I, explain myself?
Murda on the beat

[Verse 1: YFN Lucci]
Everybody get your motherfuckin' roll on
I know shorty really hate it when I prolong
I'ma take her ass to stay, she cut off both of 'em
Go 'head and get loose, girl we both grown
I'm in her inside, way passed the navel
Look like a full court slam cross that table
I'm a boss girl, what you got to pay for?
Phone bill, car note, everything I paid for
Ayy with your phone out, dancing like you J. Lo
Got your hand out but you don't want no paper
You just showing off, that new ring I bought
Girl show it off, 'cause it's alright
'Cause it's your life, ayy, huh

[Interlude: YFN Lucci]
Uhh, yeah
Want you to care for me, care for me girl, uh, uh
How I care for you

[Verse 2: YFN Lucci]
Okay it's your life
You know it's your life
You got a man but you know that nigga nothin' like me
I got a plan and I need you just for one night
I'm tryna slam dunk in that pussy, like Mike
I'm tryna put that girl to bed like night-night
I'm tryna put some diamonds on her, have her light bright
I'm talking sunlight
Yeah, sun nice
Yeah, you ain't none like me
You ain't none like me

[Interlude: YFN Lucci]
Uhh, you gotta be nice for what? (you gotta be)
She know you really pipin' up, ayy, uh, uh, yeah

[Verse 3: YFN Lucci]
Okay, I like her, cute, right, she a nice girl
I'ma wife her, fly her, every damn where
Ain't gon' lie, glad I got her, shorty piped up
And ain't gon' lie, every time we fuck
I got to tell her, uh

[Outro: Drake]
Gotta make that jump, gotta make that, gotta, gotta make that
Gotta make that jump, gotta make that, gotta, gotta make that
Gotta, gotta, gotta g-g-gotta, g-g-gotta, gotta
Gotta, g-g-gotta, gotta, gotta make that jump, jump (let's go)
Bend it over, lift it up, bend it over, lift it up
Make that jump, jump
Bend it over, lift it up, bend it over, lift it up
Make that jump, jump
Bend it over, over, over, over, over, lift it up
Make that jump, jump
Bend it over, lift it up (make that jump, jump)
Bend it over, lift it up (make that jump, jump)
