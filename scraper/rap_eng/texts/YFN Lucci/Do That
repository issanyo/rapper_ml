[Verse 1: YFN Lucci]
I pulled up to the party, at about six
I was in a Rolls Royce, I had on some Louis kicks, huh
Flyer than a bitch, huh, ridin' with my bitch
She ain't never switched sides, like this her side of the bed
Yeah yeah yeah, splash, I'm inside her lil' legs
Yeah yeah yeah, we up inside of a jet, huh
Left on my pistol and the right on her neck
I was tryna catch a nut and she was tryna get a check, yeah
She say she been gettin' that new money lately
She say she been gettin' a lot of blue money lately
She say she want me come through if you don't pay me
I don't who you talkin' to, you must be crazy, huh

She been gettin' a whole lot of blue money lately (Shake it)

[Verse 2: Blac Youngsta]
I'ma try to fuck three, four, five bitches (Shake it)
When I go out, I tote my issue (Shake it)
You can ride my dick like a bicycle (Shake it)
Ho, you goin' crazy if you think I miss you (Shake it)
Get in the tub, I'll fuck on you (Fuck, fuck)
Get her in the club, she'll suck on you (Suck, suck)
Haters gon' wish bad luck on you (Good luck)
Went to the pen, now it's stuck on you (Stuck)
Word on the streets your ass for sale (Sale)
Word on the streets your daddy tell (Tell)
Word on the streets, some pimp in a black Seville
Pulled up, she passed the mail (Mail)
Word on the streets every time that ho get some money
She get taxed like a taxes payer (Payer)
Word on the streets you the only one got some money
And your crew look bad as hell (Get your ass up)
Pull your pants up, get yourself together
Put the code in, break her like a teller
And that booty-booty in the air
Toss up with the gang, ride it like a shuttle
And I love the way you do that
All that weight loss, where your food at?
Teach that bitch how to pay her bills
Bend over now and shake that booty
