[Chorus]
Campaign nigga (campaign), still the same nigga (same)
You a lame (you a lame), never change (never change)
Gold chain (gold chain), Plain Jane (Plain Jane)
Still the same nigga (still the same nigga)
Still the same (still the same), I remain (I remain)
Took some losses (took some losses), time to gain (time to gain)
Change the game (game), can't never change (never change)
I'ma boss (I'ma boss) and you a lame (you a lame)

[Bridge]
Still the same nigga (same), never change (never change)
Campaign nigga (campaign), campaign nigga

[Verse 1]
I bought my bitch the Louie store, you on that same shit
Same nigga went and got that TEC and I got the same bitch
Young nigga, if you ain't gon' shoot, you bet not aim it
If you ain't talkin' bout money, that ain't my language
Dope man, whole thang, I can get 'em here, and you can't
I went corporate, but I damn sho' ain't gon' change
Watch me fuck that bitch and I don't even know her name
Young nigga, mind of a old nigga
Where my bank roll older than these old niggas
Money old nigga, flowin' like the old Jigga
Rose gold make these diamonds look a lil' clearer

[Chorus]
Campaign nigga (campaign), still the same nigga (same)
You a lame (you a lame), never change (never change)
Gold chain (gold chain), Plain Jane (Plain Jane)
Still the same nigga (still the same nigga)
Still the same (still the same), I remain (I remain)
Took some losses (took some losses), time to gain (time to gain)
Change the game (game), can't never change (never change)
I'ma boss (I'ma boss) and you a lame (you a lame)

[Bridge]
Still the same nigga (same), never change (never change)
Campaign nigga (campaign), campaign nigga

[Verse 2]
I'ma campaign like the mayor and the President
I'ma put my trunk in the front like an elephant
Swear, I made mo' money this month than you ever did
Hey than you ever did yeah
No mo' lean sippin', just know I mean business
You ain't sippin' right if ain't no codeine in it, yeah
You ain't livin' right, these niggas worse than bitches
Just know you livin' right when ya whole team winnin', yeah uh
Ay campaign, they throw too many crosses, it's a dirty game
I took so many losses to the chain gang
And they still hit me, yeah the number still the same, yeah I'm still the same

[Chorus]
Campaign nigga (campaign), still the same nigga (same)
You a lame (you a lame), never change (never change)
Gold chain (gold chain), Plain Jane (Plain Jane)
Still the same nigga (still the same nigga)
Still the same (still the same), I remain (I remain)
Took some losses (took some losses), time to gain (time to gain)
Change the game (game), can't never change (never change)
I'ma boss (I'ma boss) and you a lame (you a lame)

[Bridge]
Still the same nigga (same), never change (never change)
Campaign nigga (campaign nigga), campaign

Think it's a game?
