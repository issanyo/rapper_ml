Might just fly her to Trinidad
Just cause that’s where the Simmons at
Oh what a wonderful feelin' she got me high like the ceiling

She make me feel like a million

Oh she soo perfect

I'm never nervous I fuck two of ‘em on purpose
They just keep touchin and rubbin me
I think that these hoes in love with me

Rappin and trappin might pull me a capper
