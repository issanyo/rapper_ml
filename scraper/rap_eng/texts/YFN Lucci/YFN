[Hook]
We just some young fly niggas (Yeah...)
We just some young fly niggas (Yeah...)
We just some mothafuckin' fly niggas

[Verse 1]
Fly nigga take your bitch on a flight nigga
Take her wherever she like nigga
If she don't fuck some' ain't right nigga
The bankroll fit me right
Let's throw a party we ain't gon' invite niggas
Covered in all this ice
Got the Glock 40, no time to fight with ya
Shoutout to my real right niggas
My neck gold some white and yellow
For everybody who don't like it check 'em
Anotha fifty thousand on the bezel
Poppin' shit like a fuckin' kettle
Pop yo shit we don't know no better
Poppin' shit like champagne you know we took the game to another level
Daydreaming at my sky dweller
It's either now or never
Right now I'm high as ever
One of the hottest ever
I'm just being modest
I'mma be the topic
They talk about forever
When they ask about me
Just make sure you tell 'em

[Hook]
We just some young fly niggas (Yeah...)
We just some young fly niggas (Yeah...)
We just some mothafuckin' fly niggas

[Verse 2]
Fly nigga forever
Fly nigga 'bout cheddar
Fly nigga took a rich nigga bitch
Can't do nothing but respect 'em
Spent five figures on the bezel
Fly niggas make 'em jealous
I'm just a fly nigga who keep a bitch with me 'do everything that I tell her
Fly nigga took a jet to get high nigga
My bitch make more than y'all niggas
I'm poppin' way more than y'all niggas
Poppin' mo' spade than y'all niggas
Every night we gon' ball nigga
Every night we gon' ball for the nights we starved nigga
Fuck with my brothers
You know that we goin' in
They say never do dirt to one of your men
You gotta keep ya circle tight and don't let no one in
And if they ever fuckin' ask

[Hook]
