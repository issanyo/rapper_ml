When I come get my shit, it better add up
First I was hustlin' backwards, it didn't add up
Aye, being broke wasn't fun, thought it was bad luck
I heard it didn't make sense if it didn't add up
I might pull up on her soundin' like a panther (yeah)
I swear all my life I ain't have nun
I spent all my nights tryna make it add up
I know this ain't right, shit gotta add up
