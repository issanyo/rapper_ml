Uh, uh, uh, oh, oh

Yeah, suckas gon' hate, we gon' get paid
(Think it's a game?)

[Chorus]
I just brought my bitch home a new bitch
Guess that's why I'm so in love, I had to make her my bitch
Last night I met a plug, look like we gonna be rich
See we use to have dreams but now we living this shit
I just bought my bitch a Persian Rug
I'ma fuck her on the floor as soon as I hit the door
Like I ain't never made love, but I ain't never made love
But we gon' do it like we done this shit before

[Verse 1]
See she like to explore, I call her little Dora
She keep that pussy on Florida, Florida water

All these damn ghosts, is this shit paranormal?
And my wrist, this shit ain't normal (Yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Chorus]

[Never Listen Interlude]

[Intro]
Know what I'm sayin'
(No I ain't never miss)
Think it's a game
No, it's not a game, baby
You gotta listen to me when talk to you, baby
It's not a game, baby
Young fly nigga in the building, you know
(I had to tell them bitches)

[Verse 1]
Steady long, steady wrong (Yeah)
Lately I been goin' home all alone (Ayy, yeah)
Lately I been bringin' commas home
Yesterday I smashed a couple hoes
Another day, another episode
Y'all better tell them hoes
See you know we get them by the load
I'm talkin' a bail or more
See they wouldn't never know
But we gone get everyone sold
Everyone sold for the whole, nothin' low
Everyone out of that boat
Everyone know not to fold
Not to fold, everyone should know, yeah
Pressure bust pipes nigga
The reason I don't like niggas
Fuck her, then eat her all night nigga
Then leave her with all my niggas (Hey)
Even all my niggas know they my niggas
And I'm still screamin' free all my niggas 'til they free all my niggas (yeah)
Born to lose, swear I hate to lose
Hate the rules, so we break the rules
Built to win
Everyday tryin' not to sin
So much smoke, need oxygen
Fuckin' up mama's pots and pans
This is not pretend
Plus yo bitch load I'm hoppin' in (Yeah)
(Think it's a game?)
She told me I'm the flyest nigga she ever saw
That she ever saw, staring at my Audemar
Audemar on Audemar (Yeah)
Just bought my bitch a new Audemar

[Chorus]
I had to tell them bitches
I had to tell them bitches
Yeah, but they didn't never listen (Hey)
They didn't never listen
But you know we ain't never trippin'
All you gotta do is listen
You got to play your position
Girl, play your position
