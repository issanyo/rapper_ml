[Intro]
I remember days, Im talking about days
Nigga I had two fans in the crowd, it was just two, you know what I'm saying
Maybe we was at the club or maybe we was at a bar
The transition is wonderful, ya know what I mean, fly nigga shit

[Chorus]
Uh stadiums, Now I rock stadiums
I remember days when them niggas tried to play me then
Now I move work through my lady friend, watch me pack a hundred squares in a Mercedes Benz

Uh stadiums, now I rock stadiums
Now they wanna front me I used to have to pay for them
On the side stage watch me wait for them
Duffle bag full of money going straight to him

[Verse 1]
Uh big dreams you gon need a big screen
I remember getting an 8 ball when I was 16
Use to bite my nails that's how I knew the work was clean
Four/fifths was in my jeans leave a nigga on the scene
Work left my face numb, might leave a nigga face numb
Little Vietnam was the first place I got that K from
Putting the pen to the pad with some shit I couldn't escape from
Death was the gate to escape what I ran away from
Whole lot of trials and tribulations I ain't faking
Did a lot of shit I did I'd be afraid to admit if I didn't make it
We all go through shit, let's face it, gotta take it
Might strip a nigga naked leave him in my partner's basement
For the check I show that, you might need a Kodak
For the picture I'm painting nigga you gon have to show that
And that's one hell of a reason I'll never go back
Keep two under the floor mat, I'm on your shit like lojack cuz now I'm

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Uh mister red carpet hopper, Balenciaga shopper
Moving work through Natasha, nigga I get it proper
Pussy you gon need a doctor, top shotta
All you here is blocka on your block, tie you up where your Prada
Way before me and white was copping work from sly
Nowadays I charge em high, put two in the ties
See all the hating I despise, I'm loyal look in my eyes
Cream of the crop now I had to bake the pies
Who woulda thought that I'd be rich and didn't die in traffic
Living through this madness draped in designer fashions
Forever stretching like elastics, flipping just like gymnastics
Bust em right up out the plastics, lights fantastic
Travel all around the atlas, shows at the Oracle
(?)Everybody pouring up
Whole lot of chains on, everybody glowing up
Whole lot of money piling, everybody going up

[Chorus]
