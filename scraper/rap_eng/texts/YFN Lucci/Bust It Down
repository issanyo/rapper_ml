[Intro: YFN Lucci]
All my watches, bust 'em down, aww
Yeah-hey, YFN, yeah, aww

[Chorus: ? + YFN Lucci]
I just bought the Rollie, 'bout to bust it down
Fifty thousand on me how I walk around
Uh-huh, we was broke, now we do this every day, huh
Young nigga, yeah we havin' our way, huh
I know it feels to be left out
So I went and got that pack and bust it down
Yeah-hey, we went on the jugg and bust it down, yeah
Now every watch I cop, I bust it down, uh

[Verse 1: ?]
Yeah, it's YFN in this motherfucker
We gon' show you how to drop some money in this motherfucker
That's on the wrist, cold cuts and pink cups
[?] frames, dark brown like old mustard
New chains, red links, a whole ketchup
New V's in the yard, it came from hard work

[Verse 2: YFN Lucci]
Like two V's in my yard and that's in one purchase
A few keys to my dogs and it was all worth it
We all eatin' at all costs, we all hurtin'
And we beefin', you can't walk on our surface
I got my dogs lurking, some of my dogs working
No credit card working, come bust it down for me, uh

[Chorus: ? + YFN Lucci]
I just bought the Rollie, 'bout to bust it down
Fifty thousand on me how I walk around
Uh-huh, we was broke, now we do this every day, huh
Young nigga, yeah we havin' our way, huh
I know it feels to be left out
So I went and got that pack and bust it down
Yeah-hey, we went on the jugg and bust it down, yeah
Now every watch I cop, I bust it down, uh

[Verse 3: ?]
Slammer, bust it down with my niggas
Whole hundred thousand, a hundred cash with my niggas
Bust it down, you can't get a piece of this pie
'Cause you wasn't in this ride when it was really time to slide
Shots fired, shit you know guns and butter
You know my youngin out here thuggin, got them drums in the cutters

[Verse 4: ?]
Hoppin' out my brother, poppin' out with that slugger
Not that Louisville, know these Louis really, know we shoot to kill
Headshots, I don't give a damn, don't matter who he is
Sending shots, we gon send DeVille, boy you better chill
Centerfield, catching plays
All type of plays, made it out of section eight

[Chorus: ? + YFN Lucci]
I just bought the Rollie, 'bout to bust it down
Fifty thousand on me how I walk around
Uh-huh, we was broke, now we do this every day, huh
Young nigga, yeah we havin' our way, huh
I know it feels to be left out
So I went and got that pack and bust it down
Yeah-hey, we went on the jugg and bust it down, yeah
Now every watch I cop, I bust it down, uh

[Chorus: ? + YFN Lucci]
I just bought the Rollie, 'bout to bust it down
Fifty thousand on me how I walk around
Uh-huh, we was broke, now we do this every day, huh
Young nigga, yeah we havin' our way, huh

So I went and got that pack and bust it down
Yeah-hey, we went on the jugg and bust it down, yeah
Now every watch I cop, I bust it down, uh
