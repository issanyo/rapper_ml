[Verse 2: Skippa Da Flippa]
(Flippa!)
Run it up, Fuck a runner
Got the choppa flippa is the gunner
Made my own money, ima stunner
Play with them birds like a falcon punter
Me and guap ball like Kobe and Shaq
It take it to make it so make it right back
Kick doors at night you betta have on all black
It ain't good to be broke, so i ain't going back
Chase your own money and count your own cash
Thumb threw a [?] but can you count it fast?
Jugg and finesse the white boys in the city
Count up the ticket i count up big digits
Never let another nigga thumb threw your racks
Watch for the snakes that dip in your sack
Made my own money by jugging and flats
West side coming home and ain't coming back
