[Chorus: YFN Lucci]
A boss the one who guarantee we gon' eat
How you gon' tell the boss oh hell no?
How you hold the nuts on a nigga you don't know?
Just know I'm holdin' on that yop and only lord know
Yeah, and never let 'em steal your ambition
And we all thankful that we living
Everybody want to be the boss, everybody don't listen
As a child I was taught you got to pay attention

[Verse 1: YFN Lucci]
Ayy, I'm a boss and I ain't gon' act like I don't work, yeah
Swallow my pride, shit I ain't gon' lie, it got me here
Tryin' to do me best and keep 'em out my ear, yeah
I been working all day, all shifts
Look what I became, I couldn't explain how I feel
All that bumpin' your gums, gon' make my man come kill
All of this money, it got me paranoid, yeah
You know that pump sound like a bomb, nigga
Flicker bomb, nigga, huh
Ayy, we got AR's, all of 'em got drums in 'em, yeah
We gon' turn this bitch to Lil Vietnam nigga, yeah
We gon' turn this bitch to Lil Vietnam nigga, yeah

[Chorus: YFN Lucci]
A boss the one who guarantee we gon' eat
How you gon' tell the boss oh hell no?
How you hold the nuts on a nigga you don't know?
Just know I'm holdin' on that yop and only lord know
Yeah, and never let 'em steal your ambition
And we all thankful that we living
Everybody want to be the boss, everybody don't listen
As a child I was taught you got to pay attention

[Verse 2: Ralo]
How you hate on the people you say you cool with?
I got more money than the people I went to school with
I done took some losses but it don't look like I lose shit
How they put in work? ain't none of them niggas do shit
I took my bitch on a cruise ship, bought mama a new whip
Bought my sister a house 'cause I was sick of her mouth
And if she don't pay her rent, no one ain't kicking her out
And if I run out of dope, the whole city a drought (yeah)
They keep callin' my phone, I'm tryna make me a song
I put my clothes in the trap cause the trap is my home
Why do you smell like weed? (why?)
Weed is my cologne (yeah)
They cannot catch me with them bricks, I get them bitches gone

[Chorus: YFN Lucci]
A boss the one who guarantee we gon' eat
How you gon' tell the boss oh hell no?
How you hold the nuts on a nigga you don't know?
Just know I'm holdin' on that yop and only lord know
Yeah, and never let 'em steal your ambition
And we all thankful that we living
Everybody want to be the boss, everybody don't listen
As a child I was taught you got to pay attention
