[Hook]
Hey so what if them niggas made more
I knew my time was comin'
Had to wait for it
So every night a nigga prayed for it
Ain't no goin' back the only way is forward
See some people they weren't made for it
That rollie fit my wrist like it was made for it
And they hatin' but what's the hate for
Ain't no stoppin', fuck we need brakes for ?

[Verse 1]
I'm at their neck ain't no lettin' up
Fuck a vest we shoot neck and up
Life is chessed so I set em up
Life's a gamble I got hella luck
Told her we can fuck but don't get comfortable
Ain't no ceiling on my car drivin' fast yeah uncomfortable
I just flooded at my ring look like a royal rumble
They say money talk then all you niggas do is mumble
And if my bitch trippin' I might let her tumble
And no matter what I make I still remain humble
That's word to my mama
It's a cold world streets colder I gotta keep a burner

[Hook]
Hey so what if them niggas made more
I knew my time was comin'

So every night a nigga prayed for it
Ain't no goin' back the only way is forward
See some people they weren't made for it
That rollie fit my wrist like it was made for it
And they hatin' but what's the hate for
Ain't no stoppin', fuck we need brakes for ?

[Verse 2]
See I can't lose we don't lose
A million ways to get it, lil' nigga just choose
I chose, to go and eat we weren't havin' food
I showed my niggas how to eat, I ain't have nothing to prove
We were skippin' school, tryna go on the moon
The hood day comin' up, shit I'm gonna need some shoes
My kicks for a outfit, shit I done been a fool
And one thing about Lucc', I never needed you
I swear I can't wait to turn up, look what we been through
Lost both of my cousins this year, fuck keepin' cool
On my side we ride for our kind
And did they tell you I don't play about mine

[Hook]
Hey so what if them niggas made more
