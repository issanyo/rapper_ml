[Verse 1]
Another day, another dollar
Still ridin' 'round in my Impala
Its another day, and everyday we gotta profit yeah
You know it's robbin' season and everybody out plottin'
I don't speak but don't say alot to me
Sleep but baby not on me
Play but you don't wanna play with me
We got so much artillery
We got heart like Timothy
A life sentence if they sentence me
Niggas talk 'bout all that shit I ain't never seen
My niggas be lurkin'
Everybody ain't perfect
If a nigga say he did it knowin' he ain't did that nigga workin'
And now I'm something you ain't never seen can't say my rival wasn't worth it
And Michelangelo probably couldn't even paint a picture this prefect
I learned the harder way, we goin all the way, we goin our way
They won by mistake
Everything ain't everything and everywhere ain't safe
Made a promise to my mama we gon' make it out the hood one day
Gotta get out the hood one day
We gon' get out the hood one day

[Hook]
That's all I use to say
And they ask me who I do it for
Why I shine, why I grind the way I do
They ask me who I do it for
I want it bad you should see the shit that I been through
This is what I do it for
My kids, all them loses I didn't win, all them bitches I didn't hit
This is what I do it for

[Verse 2]
Nobody gave me shit nigga
I had to grind for it had to go get it
Never backed down or ran from no nigga
It wasn't no blueprint we didn't know Jigga
We just some lost kids with some hope in em'
We all sin we don't know better
It's a drought in I ain't got no cheddar
It's Christmas time and we don't know santa
Around Christmas time I'm a cold fellow
About my dough I'ma go getta
It's hard to sale when the dope wetter
Ride on em' like a fourwheeler
Ride on em' let my dawg get em'
Watch them all sick em'
If I miss em' then my dawg'll hit em'
Getcha popped over a small issue
Ridin' round in that new shit it got a hog in it
Pockets like it gotta frog in it
Bankroll Frank all in it (and I'm a pussy if something small in it)
Authenic, real hunnits these authenic
Red bottoms these cost plenty
Pink slip your car rented

[Chorus]
That's all I use to say
And they ask me who I do it for
Why I shine, why I grind the way I do
They ask me who I do it for
I want it bad you should see the shit that I been through
This is what I do it for
My kids, all them loses I didn't win, all them bitches I didn't hit
This is what I do it for

[Outro]
I learned the harder way
We goin all the way
We goin our way
