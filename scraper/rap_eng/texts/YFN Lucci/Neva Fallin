[Pre-Chorus: Paxquiao]
Lot of cash, soon as I get it, bitch, I spend it
Bitch, I spend it, I got plenty
Expensive linen, windows tinted, nothin' rented
Bankroll, can't bend it, I ball like tennis, my niggas with me
A lot of ice, I'm livin' bright, my money right
Hey, fuck the price, get what I like
My niggas right, they shootin' dice
Still on the block, ain't nothin' stop
You still get popped, still fuck the cops, yeah

[Chorus: Paxquiao]
Hey I'm still ridin' 'round with my dawgs
We gettin' money, bitch, you know we ballin'
Hell nah, nigga, we ain't never fallin'
Hell nah, nigga, we ain't never fallin'

[Verse 1: Paxquiao]
I'm just tryna run me up a big bag
Ain't got no patience, I can't wait, I'm tryna get rich fast
I'm runnin' up digits, bitch, I'm livin', bitch, I'm gettin' it
Bitch, I'm walkin' 'round with plenty
Pocket rocket tucked in my linen
Ride through the hood with a thot bitch
Still catchin' juggs, told 'em meet me in the 'partment
Came from the dirt, now we brackin'
Too much work, got me slidin' in traffic
Do me a favor, keep it cool with the neighbors
Young nigga Popeye with the knots out, I got

[Pre-Chorus: Paxquiao]
Lot of cash, soon as I get it, bitch, I spend it
Bitch, I spend it, I got plenty
Expensive linen, windows tinted, nothin' rented
Bankroll, can't bend it, I ball like tennis, my niggas with me
A lot of ice, I'm livin' bright, my money right
Hey, fuck the price, get what I like
My niggas right, they shootin' dice
Still on the block, ain't nothin' stop
You still get popped, still fuck the cops, yeah

[Chorus: Paxquiao]
Hey I'm still ridin' 'round with my dawgs
We gettin' money, bitch, you know we ballin'
Hell nah, nigga, we ain't never fallin'
Hell nah, nigga, we ain't never fallin'

[Verse 2: YFN Lucci]
Yeah, a lot of ice, I'm livin' right
I poured an eight up in a Sprite, I'm gon' sip tonight
I told my baby, gotta do right, you don't wanna miss this life, yeah
In the mall, pick what you like, girl, forget the price, yeah
Rose gold, a canary, yeah, solitaire me, yeah
Think I won't get that Lambo truck, don't double-dare me, yeah
Pint of cherry, yeah
And I'm nothin' like you niggas, don't compare me, yeah yeah

[Pre-Chorus: Paxquiao]
Lot of cash, soon as I get it, bitch, I spend it
Bitch, I spend it, I got plenty
Expensive linen, windows tinted, nothin' rented
Bankroll, can't bend it, I ball like tennis, my niggas with me
A lot of ice, I'm livin' bright, my money right
Hey, fuck the price, get what I like
My niggas right, they shootin' dice
Still on the block, ain't nothin' stop
You still get popped, still fuck the cops, yeah

[Chorus: Paxquiao]
Hey I'm still ridin' 'round with my dawgs
We gettin' money, bitch, you know we ballin'
Hell nah, nigga, we ain't never fallin'
Hell nah, nigga, we ain't never fallin'

[Outro: Paxquiao]
Hell nah, nigga, we ain't never fallin'
Hell nah, nigga, we ain't never fallin'
