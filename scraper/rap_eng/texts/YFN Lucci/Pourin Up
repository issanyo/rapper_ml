[Verse 1: Johnny Cinco]
We gon' ball forever, we don’t need a mil just to ball together
Took a truck to Cali we was all together
Strategise the plan, put it all together
When we was dead broke we would starve together
Now I’m living life I’m fine, I’m better
Looking at the jeweler all the ice on the bezels
Looking at my rollie ain’t look right on me fella
Looking at my rollie that’s a whole nother time
Pop another perc sipping lean like it’s wine
Said she never seen a nigga like my kind
Need the bitch 100, ain't got time for a dime
I was broke shit was weighin' hard on my mind
I ain’t even eat, but I bought me a line
I ain’t mean to preach a lot of shit on my mind
Popi catchin' straight g shit all the time

[Hook: Johnny Cinco]
I been pouring more tryna fade way
I was going broke I pray for better days
And when your going broke you gotta make a way
You want your four more just give me 20 eighths
Riding round in the wraith you should see they face
Young fly nigga babe each and every day
I ain’t wit the same crew ever since the hate
Got the runner out the blue you should see the fade

[Verse 2: YFN Lucci]
Young fly nigga each and every day
I went broke pray for better days
You know the hate come from each and every other way
Another cake coming in like it’s a niggas birthday
When the fake came in I had to separate
My nigga just beat a case we gotta celebrate
When it come to finger fuckin' that trigger you celibate
I ain't ever ran off, four door never hit
I ain't ever brag on nothin' I ain't ever did
From my niece son to a vert to a bid
Got my heart broken by a little bitch
Now my heart colder than a little bit
Ice on me colder than a damn fridge
I'ma put a whole damn cooler on my damn wrist
I’ma put like four franks mulas on your whole clique
True story if a nigga ever told it

[Hook: Johnny Cinco + YFN Lucci]
I been pourin' more tryna fade way
I was going broke I pray for better days
And when your going broke you gotta make a way
You want your four more just give me 20 eighths
Riding round in the wraith you should see the fade
Young fly nigga babe each and every day
I ain’t wit the same crew ever since the hate
Got the runner out the blue you should see the fade
