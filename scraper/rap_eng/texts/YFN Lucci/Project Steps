[Verse 1: Yung Bleu]
If you ain't gon' slide lil nigga, don't ride
Straight off the project step
Grew up on the project step, grew up on the project step
Flooded my chain and rings in rocks
All of my lil niggas came to box
I bought a Lambo and changed the top
Broke in the game, I changed the lock
I got the streets in a headlock, I got these lil niggas scared now
Gucci me down, I got a lil bread now
We get the drugs and packages
Stand at the store all day like a mannequin
I want the money and I want the smoke
Straight out of Balmain, bitch I'm the GOAT
Designer for all my coats
Cartier lens, brand new Benz, fuck you and your friends
I was just livin' my best life
Run up on Bleu, you get hit with a pole and they gon' see you in the next life
We gon' get high like it's Jet Lyfe
You better get on the next flight

[Chorus: Yung Bleu]
If you ain't gon' slide lil nigga, don't ride
Straight off the project step
Grew up on the project step, grew up on the project step
Don't need a shooter, I do it myself
Don't need a shooter, I do it myself, I'm straight off the project
If you ain't gon' slide lil nigga, don't ride
Straight off the project step
Grew up on the project step, grew up on the project step
Don't need a shooter, I do it myself
Don't need a shooter, I do it myself, I'm straight off the project step

[Verse 2: YFN Lucci]
I'm straight off the project step, jump on that Pyrex, yeah
We ain't gotta call no help, huh, I'ma do it all by myself
I'm in the booth with a ratchet
You know that them boys get active, yeah
You gon' make that boy get at you, yeah
Shoot at you niggas for practice, yeah
Ayy all of this money in the mattress
You know that them boys came up trappin'
Ayy you gon' make them boys catch you in traffic
Bring all them guns out the attic
You know I'ma pull it if I have it
Just know it's a fully automatic
Better know this shit flooded, this a Patek
Better know that we pull up and get nasty, uh
You ain't gon' slide lil nigga, don't ride lil nigga
308 sittin' beside the killer, big draco, we slidin' with 'em
Know we keep 'em, we don't hide from niggas, yeah
We do not hide from niggas
You ain't even want to go drive to get 'em
I ain't even gotta be ridin' to hit 'em, yeah

[Chorus: Yung Bleu]
If you ain't gon' slide lil nigga, don't ride
Straight off the project step
Grew up on the project step, grew up on the project step
Don't need a shooter, I do it myself
Don't need a shooter, I do it myself, I'm straight off the project
If you ain't gon' slide lil nigga, don't ride
Straight off the project step
Grew up on the project step, grew up on the project step
Don't need a shooter, I do it myself
Don't need a shooter, I do it myself, I'm straight off the project step

[Outro: Yung Bleu]
Brand new old school, had to get rid of my old tool (skrrt skrrt)
Project, project, project (project)
Brand new old school, had to get rid of my old tool (skrrt skrrt)
Project (project), project (yeah)
Four hundred degrees (skrrt)
I keep a chopper up under my sleeve (brrat)
(Bah bah bah bah bah bah)
Block is hot, straight out the trap, stir the pot (stir, stir)
Stir the pot
