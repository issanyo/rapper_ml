Uh, you know I'm living
Step still gone fuck the penitentiary
A whole lot of love niggas still envyin'
I'on give a fuck who feel offended
I say we only wanted cake, playin round you get ate
What's a bear to a room full of apes?
I told momma it was straight, she put food on the plate
Stayed down told momma I'ma make it
I can feel it, I can feel it
Last year I ain't have a penny, now I got plenty
I can feel it, I can feel it
A nigga play we gone make 'em feel it
I'm on a mission Tom Ford button down plus the coupe fitted [?]
Nigga soakin' up game, shootin' shot with no aim, yeah I know you listening
Okay long live Nut nigga
And long as I'm living we gone hunt nigga, lunch nigga
Each and every one of yall niggas, I'ma bury every one of yall niggas
I wonder why the sun don't shine here everyday
And every time a nigga down then we wanna pray
And every time a nigga up these bitches wanna lay
These bitches turn fake, these niggas turn fake
Can't love her, yeah see me dawg
I'm the God and they all look like Ray Charles
Play with one boy then we all get involved
Baby calm down you know we all on that bus shit
Icky in the coupe bitch we all lit
You know zelly got the oil and the stick
We the wrong ones to fuck with, we done got up in they seat
I swear, a couple years we ain't have shit
I had dreams to be mad rich
You know I used to scheme now a nigga doing shows for 15
Living proof bitch I am it
Straight from the slums I'm from
I stood on that block till my palms was numb
I needed every dollar, so I sold every bomb
And I ain't like to borrow so I went and took some
I always knew that I was wrong, it was the principle
I just couldn't be broke it was the principle
I never really had dreams to be a principle
I only wanted rings and in my dreams foreign cars all I seen
And everything a nigga dreamed is what I meant to do
And I'm moving bout my team you know Trey and Boot KF too
You know Ju will shoot
Probably was bumpin' the menaces
I be in the hood and the trenches, I be with the Birdgang niggas
Long live Nut, that's my nigga, Stan too, Almilt too don't nun move but the money you know what it do
If I forgot you I ain't forget you fool
Mad love for my Summerhill crew
