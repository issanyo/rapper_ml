[Verse 1: Ralo]
Fell in love with my niggas
I cannot live without 'em
They my partners, I wouldn't trade 'em for a million dollars
Momma, buying this jewelry became a bad habit
If I told you what I paid then you'd be mad at me
Call me stupid, Bentley coupe it, I drive it like a hooptie
Them haters wanna shoot me but be scared to do something to me
We'll frie your whole block without the eye on
Me and my niggas done caught more cases than a Iphone
I'm in the block with the Bentley
They tried to forget me
They tried to come get me
It got me convicted
They tryna pipe up, we gon' bring them pipes out
You in the wrong place fucking with the right guy

[Verse 2: Ralo]
I heard that they've been talkin' bad 'bout me
Before them niggas try that shit, they better ask about me
I bought my bitch so much shit that I don't know what to get her
I told her (?) bein' a real nigga
Everyday Imma make 'em hate that they took me down
They see me turned up everyday, them bitches want me now
We used to go steal at the damn mall
You can close your eyes cause you'll never see the fam fall
Came from them bandos, now I’m in them Lambos
Fuck with my fam-o I turn into Rambo
I promise, I swear, won’t lie, can’t lie
You touch, my guy, yo ass, gon' die

Tell em stay out our business
All em niggas be snitchin
Look around in the city, we gettin’ all the attention
