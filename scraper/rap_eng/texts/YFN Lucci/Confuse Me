[Hook: Blac Youngsta & YFN Lucci]
I’m a savage, I’m a gangster
Where I’m from them niggas bangin’
Put holes in your baby’s blanket
I’m a savage, I’m a gangster
We gon’ cut a nigga’s fingers
If they ever tryna take stuff from me
If you fucking with my family
It gon get a lil bit dangerous
I’m gon’ have to come and hang you
Go to war ‘bout my lil angels
Ain’t no love for no strangers
You know the boy ain’t scared to hit ‘em all

[Post-Hook: YFN Lucci]
You don’t love me
You confuse me
Always judge me
And abuse me
You don’t love me
You confuse me, yeah

[Verse 1: Blac Youngsta]
C-M-G, I don’t know why you niggas hatin’ on me
I don’t know why you niggas play with me
Like I don’t keep that K on me
I got choppers, I got missiles
I got hitters, I won’t hesitate to send ‘em
If you play with me, yeah
Police mask, I’ma ride
It gon’ be a homicide
I was broke, no one loved me
Now I’m rich, they love me now
Got the Lam doors up, got my Gucci shirt tucked
YFMB, CMG, they can’t fuck with us

[Hook: Blac Youngsta & YFN Lucci]
I’m a savage, I’m a gangster
Where I’m from them niggas bangin’
Put holes in your baby’s blanket
I’m a savage, I’m a gangster
We gon’ cut a nigga’s fingers
If they ever tryna take stuff from me
If you fucking with my family
It gon get a lil bit dangerous
I’m gon’ have to come and hang you
Go to war ‘bout my lil angels
Ain’t no love for no strangers
You know the boy ain’t scared to hit ‘em all

[Post-Hook: Blac Youngsta]
You don’t love me
You confuse me
Always judge me
And abuse me
You don’t love me girl, you don’t fuck me
Like you used to fuck me, girl you don’t love me

[Verse 2: YFN Lucci]
Ups and downs, ups and downs
Remember we was down, now we up
No more down, remember how we
Came up from stayin’ down
Mama tell me never change up but be safe now
I was in a Nissan I’m in a Wraith now
Two kids, a few gears, we in state now
We been caked so we got lawyers, we gettin’ cake now
You know it’s hard to spot the real from the fake now, yeah

[Hook: Blac Youngsta & YFN Lucci]
I’m a savage, I’m a gangster
Where I’m from them niggas bangin’
Put holes in your baby’s blanket
I’m a savage, I’m a gangster
We gon’ cut a nigga’s fingers
If they ever tryna take stuff from me
If you fucking with my family
It gon get a lil bit dangerous
I’m gon’ have to come and hang you
Go to war ‘bout my lil angels
Ain’t no love for no strangers
You know the boy ain’t scared to hit ‘em all

[Outro: YFN Lucci]
I’m a savage, I’m a gangster
Where I’m from them niggas bangin’
I’m a savage, I’m a gangster
If you ever think about takin’ it
