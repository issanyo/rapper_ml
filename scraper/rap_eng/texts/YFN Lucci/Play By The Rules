[Intro: Omelly]
OTL!

[Verse 1: Omelly]
Niggas sleeping on me, I bet they slippin' up
Toting big boy shit, now step your weapons up
Fuck a pop in your leg, I'm shooting chest and up
Thinkin' a [?] in the grave, nigga I had enough
Had these fuck niggas talking, I guess they wanna die
In my hood we meet up and then we let it fly
Look at these fuck niggas bitching, they seen that red dot
Everyday got a [?], now
Ain't nobody safe in this bitch, nigga I'm goin' off
Caught a case in this snitch, fuck is you doing dog
Everybody fuck with these rats, fuck is I'm doing wrong
I ain't got no rap if you told, I knock your grill off

[Hook: Omelly]
I'm on my time and I'm out here
If you not getting money, what you out here for?
Stacking paper, this is my year
I'm only getting to it, I ain't one of those bulls
Got to play the rules if you in it
'Cause you can make the news any minute
Better play the rules if you in it
'Cause you can make the news any minute
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 2: YFN Lucci]
You better play by the rules if you in it
'Cause you can make the news any minute
I know niggas in your crew ain't never did shit and it ain't nothin' to get your whole crew hit
Look, pressure [?] and you know that right
60K on ice, that was somethin' light
Used to fist fight, now we carry pipes
Take from me and I take your life
A young nigga from the street
No more wrong to right
And if a nigga play with me get him gone tonight
Real shot caller
Let the .40 pop your top like a black bottle
Only time you shooting shots is when is with the down ball bruh

[Hook: Omelly]
I'm on my time and I'm out here
If you not getting money, what you out here for?
Stacking paper, this is my year
I'm only getting to it, I ain't one of those bulls
Got to play the rules if you in it
'Cause you can make the news any minute
Better play the rules if you in it
'Cause you can make the news any minute
