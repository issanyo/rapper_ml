[Chorus: YFN Lucci]
Oooh, sittin’ here thinkin’ bout how shit used to be
Damn I remember, goddamn I remember those times, aye
About my shit I’ma get rich or die tryin' (get rich or die tryin')
Every man count can’t be a waste of my time

[Verse 1: Mozzy]
Really cooked the soft really came from the struggle
Off for two months easy days in the struggle
I never fumble only promise that I made
Ask mama, damn near gave her ever comma that I made
Know it's something hangin' from that Somalama thang
Young life crucify you for that problem, we gang
Lord knows, it’s a body on the thang
It’s a body on the thang, Lord knows
You don’t catch a body for the gang, you ain’t know
Lil caught a body for the gang then he told
Murder on my mind that ain’t healthy for your soul
Trackin' down a bag, gettin’ wealthy on the road
It’s only right that I go and let you niggas know
I put you on, you ain’t reimburse me for the zone
Makin' model got me lookin’ perty on the low
You ain’t playin' nothin', you just murder niggas low

[Chorus: YFN Lucci]
Oooh, sittin’ here thinkin’ bout how shit used to be
Damn I remember, goddamn I remember those times, aye
About my shit I’ma get rich or die tryin' (get rich or die tryin')
Every man count can’t be a waste of my time

[Verse 2: E Mozzy]
Up early in the mornin', blaze up a couple sticks
Searchin' for the drug 'cause this thang I’m tryna fix
Up go yay cray cray with the whip
Serve peach Fanta, couple Xans got me lit
Eatin’ up the Interstate, paranoid they might eat
Yeah them pigs hit but they ain’t find shit
Make them niggas sick 'cause they know my time hit
If you ain’t from the gang, you ain’t welcome round here
Better keep it on you if you walk around here
All we know is murder, get dropped around here
Keep it stitched lid, ain’t no talkin’ round here
It’s a couple real niggas, wish they was out here
You pillow talkin’ keep that sucka shit down there
'Cause I die about mine, boy this shit really real
You don't wanna have my squad pull up for the drip
Hundred shell gang, I make you niggas feel

[Chorus: YFN Lucci]
Oooh, sittin’ here thinkin’ bout how shit used to be
Damn I remember, goddamn I remember those times, aye
About my shit I’ma get rich or die tryin' (get rich or die tryin')
Every man count can’t be a waste of my time
