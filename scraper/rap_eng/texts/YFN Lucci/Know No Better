[Verse 1]
Still in the hood
Still riding 'round up to no good
Chopper on the back seat
I wish a fuck nigga would Like I don't know no better
Imma squeeze like the boy Hugh Hefner
We don't know no better
If he run let the bulldog fetch 'em
Nigga never loved us
All these bitches love us
Everybody calling my phone
Where were y'all at when I was growing up (Say yeah)
If I don't know 'em Imma tell 'em
Truth is I don't know that fella
He gone fold under pressure
Truth is he don't know no better
Two cups riding 'round, no liquor
Two door, no roof that's Fisker
Walked in smelling like a motherfuckin' bag
With all my niggas
Ran through a whole lotta motherfuckin' cash
With all my niggas
Hate when they say they gone do right
Always do 'em wrong fuck wrong with 'em?
I did it for all of my niggas
I switched up my Audi lil nigga
This is a Audi my nigga
Could've went and bought another vehicle
Turn up the hood, bought 'em all a vehicle
Can't wait to go ride on 'em niggas
We cannot wait to collide with them niggas, no
We do not hide from no nigga
Where I come from, we was always them niggas
Mason Margielas, boy when you step up
We wanted extra, so we got extra No

They asked me to sign why should I sign? (Yeah)
