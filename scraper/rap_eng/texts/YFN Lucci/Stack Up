[Intro: Lotto Savage]
You know what I'm sayin', trappin' house hot man, you know what the fuck we doin' man
We be in this motherfuckin' house mid-trappin', know what I'm sayin'
You from the hood man, you now how we doin' the brick man
Sticks and shit, dracos on that
Motherfuckin' thirty hangin' out our pocket, bankrolls everywhere
Chain glistening, you know what the fuck goin' on

[Chorus: Lotto Savage]
Traphouse, beat it out
Pack in, ship 'em out
The plug just dropped off them bales, yeah
We put that fish on the scale
Stackin' this money and gettin' this paper
And I swear I ain't takin' no L
Sellin' these bales, I do this shit very well
And I know it ain't hard to tell
Run up a check, stack up the chip
Run up a check, stack up the chip
Run up a check, stack up the chip
Run up a check, stack up the chip
Run up a check, stack up the chip
Run up a check, stack up the chip
Run up a check, stack up the chip
Run up a check, stack up the chip

[Verse 1: Lotto Savage]
Check, flex, bitch I'm fly as a jet
I will die 'bout my respect
Fully loaded, you know I keep a TEC
My OG say Lotto run up you a check
Flex on these niggas and show 'em you next
It was times I had to jugg and finesse
Now I'm trappin', makin' plays on the jet
I got three traphouses, they goin', uh-huh
My money keep flowin'
Trapped your whole house out, now I'm in the foreign
Fucked on three bitches and all 'em were foreign
We rollin' up grams, we call 'em Fruity Pebbles
Keep the burner so they call me a rebel
Cross on the level, take me from the devil
'Cause I'm in the trenches trappin' forever

[Chorus: Lotto Savage]
Traphouse, beat it out
Pack in, ship 'em out
The plug just dropped off them bales, yeah
We put that fish on the scale
Stackin' this money and gettin' this paper
And I swear I ain't takin' no L
Sellin' these bales, I do this shit very well
And I know it ain't hard to tell
Run up a check, stack up the chip
Run up a check, stack up the chip
Run up a check, stack up the chip
Run up a check, stack up the chip
Run up a check, stack up the chip
Run up a check, stack up the chip
Run up a check, stack up the chip
Run up a check, stack up the chip

[Verse 2: YFN Lucci]
Run up a check, yeah
Better know a young nigga like me got now, fuck who got next
Right now I got a quarter milly on my neck, yeah, uh
And I ain't payin' for no sex, yeah, bitch gon' rep the set
Nah I ain't wifing no bitch, yeah
Whole lot of ice on my shit, yeah
Run down on whoever with it, ayy
Then go beat the trap like a pimp do a trick
Huggin' that block how I might do my bitch
Pocket knotted up like it got a cyst
Fuck her and her sis, know we count the lick
Know we handle shit, uh

[Chorus: Lotto Savage]
Traphouse, beat it out
Pack in, ship 'em out
The plug just dropped off them bales, yeah
We put that fish on the scale
Stackin' this money and gettin' this paper
And I swear I ain't takin' no L
Sellin' these bales, I do this shit very well
And I know it ain't hard to tell
Run up a check, stack up the chip
Run up a check, stack up the chip
Run up a check, stack up the chip
Run up a check, stack up the chip
Run up a check, stack up the chip
Run up a check, stack up the chip
Run up a check, stack up the chip
Run up a check, stack up the chip

[Outro: Lotto Savage]
Run up a, check
Run up a, check
Run up a, check
Run up a, check
