[Intro: PnB Rock]
There she go, there she go
There she go, oh yeah

[Hook: PnB Rock]
Every time she walk by, every time she walk by
Every time she walk by, I be like there she go
Every time she walk by, I can see in her eyes
Shawty be feeling my vibes, I be like there she go
Every time she walk by, every time she walk by
Every time she walk by, I be like there she go
Every time she walk by, I can see in her eyes
Shawty feeling my vibes, I be like there she go

[Verse 1: PnB Rock]
I be like there she go
She can't stand these hoes
She don't even know, she the only one I want
She don't know, she got me chasing
When I see her my heart be racing
She don't know, I'm so impatient
So put your number in my phone
I'll hit you up, when I get home
'Cause lately I been on the road
But you can help me count this dough
You can meet me at the Westin
Shawty, you can bring your best friend
Ain't no need for all this textin'
Because shawty, I get the message
We can kick it, I'll beat it like Tekken
You can meet me at the Westin
Shawty, you can bring your best friend
Ain't no need for all this sexin'
We can kick it I'll beat it like Tekken

[Hook: PnB Rock]
Every time she walk by, every time she walk by
Every time she walk by, I be like there she go
Every time she walk by, I can see in her eyes
Shawty be feeling my vibes, I be like there she go
Every time she walk by, every time she walk by
Every time she walk by, I be like there she go
Every time she walk by, I can see in her eyes
Shawty feeling my vibes, I be like there she go

[Verse 2: YFN Lucci]
There she go, there she go
Lil mama badder than a three-year-old
Damn, I'm tryna be with her
I'm down to spend a key on her
Lock you down and throw away the key
And I ain't never gon' release it, girl
We can break up three times a week
But ain't never gon' leave, girl
Never ever switch up, she'll never
Be there for me
She seen a rat, but she'll never tell ya
Love me forever and ever
As long as my heart beat, you the one that got a part of me
You were there before the start of me
Now Iâ€™m all alone with you, I was staring at our pictures
Now I got you in red bottoms
We was at the bottom, now we different
Nowadays I'm in a red [?]
Nowadays I might stuff a 50 in her purse to let her know, I miss her

[Hook: PnB Rock]
Every time she walk by, every time she walk by
Every time she walk by, I be like there she go
Every time she walk by, I can see in her eyes
Shawty be feeling my vibes, I be like there she go
Every time she walk by, every time she walk by
Every time she walk by, I be like there she go
Every time she walk by, I can see in her eyes
Shawty feeling my vibes, I be like there she go

Every time she walk by, every time she walk by
Every time she walk by, I be like there she go
Every time she walk by, I can see in her eyes
Shawty be feeling my vibes, I be like there she go
Every time she walk by, every time she walk by
Every time she walk by, I be like there she go
Every time she walk by, I can see in her eyes
Shawty feeling my vibes, I be like there she go
