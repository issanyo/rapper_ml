[Intro: YFN Kay]
Where were you? (where?)
We was on the block, you was on the stoop (right here)
I done put so many niggas on the news
Where were you? (where?)
We was on the block, you was on the stoop
It's YFN, better know the story's true

[Chorus: YFN Kay]
All this money, yeah you know fucked up my whole life
All this trappin', yeah you know fucked up my whole life
All that swipin', yeah you know fucked up my whole life
I rolled the dice, yeah I play with my whole life
I been mixin' up the clean, yeah my whole life
Percocet mix with codeine, my whole life
Two-two-three will clear the whole scene and take your whole life
Fuck a stripe, I been 'bout this shit my whole life

[Verse 1: YFN Kay]
Where were you? (where?)
We was on the block, you was on the stoop, uh (right here)
I done put so many niggas on the news, uh
No I do not mix them niggas with my crew (nah)
It's YFN, better known the story's true
They hit you for ninety-six then we moved to some new shit
Then we flew, call shoot, now them blues out the blue
Me and Lu is in the booth, yeah we flamed it on purpose
I'm lookin' back on that shit, you better know it was worth it
Now it's champaign showers, a bitch for every hour
Bags got louder while the face got sour
Still chasin' the money and the power (I'm chasin', I'm gone)
Still might finesse you with some flour (finesse, cha-ching)

[Chorus: YFN Kay]
All this money, yeah you know fucked up my whole life
All this trappin', yeah you know fucked up my whole life
All that swipin', yeah you know fucked up my whole life
I rolled the dice, yeah I play with my whole life
I been mixin' up the clean, yeah my whole life
Percocet mix with codeine, my whole life
Two-two-three will clear the whole scene and take your whole life
Fuck a stripe, I been 'bout this shit my whole life

[Verse 2: YFN Lucci]
All the money fuckin' up a nigga whole life
Swear I got bitches on lord, niggas on life
They know they the thug life, better know that it's on sight
They know they better not fuck with none of my dogs 'cause they gon' bite
Yeah yeah yeah, uh
I give no fucks 'bout it, I give no fucks 'bout it
I get that strap in the club shawty
I ain't gon' be scrappin' with nobody
I can't be dappin' up nobody (no, no, no)
So solid, can't fold, they gon' hide me
For the fam I'd do a thousand
Years, It took a lot of blood, sweat, and tears
I make a fuck boy disappear, I turned a bankroll into a mil
Lost some fake niggas to a real one
Y'all gon' make a nigga  kill someone
How could you fear someone?
Yeah-eah, uh

[Chorus: YFN Kay]
All this money, yeah you know fucked up my whole life
All this trappin', yeah you know fucked up my whole life
All that swipin', yeah you know fucked up my whole life
I rolled the dice, yeah I play with my whole life
I been mixin' up the clean, yeah my whole life
Percocet mix with codeine, my whole life
Two-two-three will clear the whole scene and take your whole life
Fuck a stripe, I been 'bout this shit my whole life
