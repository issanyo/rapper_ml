Shootin' up a nigga family house, that there get my mans involved
Make me get at your mans and all, nah we ain't got to pay it off

Money power respect, one hand grippin' my TEC
Whole lotta water drippin' from my neck, that's VVS
Whole lotta lean drippin' from my cup, that's CVS
Whole lotta pounds drop on the first, that's UPS
These niggas want to be famous, leave a fuck nigga plankin'
Brains all over the floor, now I see what you thinkin'
That's on Nut, that's on Nut, In my Glock I trust
I can't wait to bust, leave a pussy nigga stuck
Put your pistols up, while I ship on two cups
Twistin' my fingers up, whole lotta new bucks
We knock 'em down, you pick 'em up
They ain't 'bout no action, they just talk about it
Leave the scene cloudy, lotta smoke around it

[Chorus: YFN Lucci]
Somethin' like propane, uh, too much smoke man, hey
Yeah, I ain't got no feelings for no hoe man yeah
Call me snowman, I froze both chains yeah aye

Yeah, shine when I get, up, one hand on my, uh
I'm gon' hold it down yeah, for whoever want smoke yeah
One hand on my Glock yeah, they know how it go

Move bags like a garage truck, huh, get your order up
Used to ride the Marta bus, huh, now they charter us
Nigga you ain't hard enough, huh, how you want war with us? huh
You ain't startin' with us (nigga), you ain't part of us
Grindin, lately I've been grindin'
Which car to slide in? Havin' trouble decidin'
Whole lotta diamonds in the face, can't see what time it is
I ain't even signed a deal, I'd probably be swipin' still (haha)
On hand on that, huh, rubberband that, huh
Probably too much, huh, rockin' too much, huh
One call get you touched, DJ Screw in my cup (yeah)

I'm gon' hold it down yeah, for whoever want smoke yeah
One hand on my Glock yeah, they know how it go
