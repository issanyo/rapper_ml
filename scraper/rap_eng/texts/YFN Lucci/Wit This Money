[Hook: YFN Lucci & Moneybagg Yo]
I ain’t doin’ shit with the money, I might as well buy me a coupe
I ain’t doin’ shit with the money, I might buy my bitch one too
Ain’t doin’ shit with the money, ain’t doin’ shit with the money
Ain’t doin’ shit with this money, ain’t doin’ shit with this money
Ain’t doin’ shit with the money, be honest I don’t know what to do
I ain’t doin’ shit with this money, I might as well tell you the truth
Ain’t doin’ shit with the money, ain’t doin’ shit with the money
Ain’t doin’ shit with this money, ain’t doin’ shit with this money

[Verse 1: Moneybagg Yo]
Ain’t doing shit with it, built me a bitch with it
Serve you some wop then buy me a whip with it
Sippin’ Act, apple cranberry mixed with it
How you say you street, you never been in it
Ain’t doing shit with this money
I might come and buy your team up ‘cause you can’t feed ‘em
Ain’t do nothing but get her hair and nails done
And now she got the big head like Gina
I’m in the building like bruh-man
Life in this bitch just like Conan
I’m not a yes, I’m a no man
Pull up, I’m dumping with one hand
I’m in Hawaii with wifebeaters
Smoking the blunt and her butt got a suntan
I’m poppin’ percs, they turning me up
And I’m feeling like I’m a hype man
They just booked a nigga out in Cali
First class now I’m out of here
Walk in the spot and secure the bag
I don’t fuck with nobody here
I live my live past forty, haters they want to rewind
I went and bust down a Rollie, I call this shit perfect time

[Hook: YFN Lucci & Moneybagg Yo]
I ain’t doin’ shit with the money, I might as well buy me a coupe
I ain’t doin’ shit with the money, I might buy my bitch one too
Ain’t doin’ shit with the money, ain’t doin’ shit with the money
Ain’t doin’ shit with this money, ain’t doin’ shit with this money
Ain’t doin’ shit with the money, be honest I don’t know what to do
I ain’t doin’ shit with this money, I might as well tell you the truth
Ain’t doin’ shit with the money, ain’t doin’ shit with the money
Ain’t doin’ shit with this money, ain’t doin’ shit with this money

[Verse 2: Moneybagg Yo]
I just went a put a charm on the Cuban
Come in like a hoochie but the bitch from Cuba
Gave her a couple hundred, smacked her on the booty
Five grams rolled, smoking on the cutie
Told ‘em wish me well, know I fuck with Lucci
Man I swear I’m ‘bout to lose it
Talkin’ shit, you gotta prove it
I’m ‘bout action like a movie
All of this money that’s bringing these problems
They talking, they lying, I’m sick of the gossip
Acting ass nigga need an Oscar
You know I got a real nigga posture
Finessed everybody, el [?]
Street nigga but my swag proper
Eating steak, butter, and lobster
She’s gonna choose, how you gonna stop her?
Ain’t doin’ shit with this money, ain’t doin’ shit with this cash
I fucked up a bag
I won’t say shit with this money
I send a hit with this money, do you understand?
I tried to told you ain’t playing
Got 50K sitting on top of my hand
Get money was part of the plan
Pop a xanny then fuck on a fan

I ain’t doin’ shit with the money, I might as well buy me a coupe

Ain’t doin’ shit with the money, ain’t doin’ shit with the money
Ain’t doin’ shit with this money, ain’t doin’ shit with this money
Ain’t doin’ shit with the money, be honest I don’t know what to do
I ain’t doin’ shit with this money, I might as well tell you the truth
Ain’t doin’ shit with the money, ain’t doin’ shit with the money
