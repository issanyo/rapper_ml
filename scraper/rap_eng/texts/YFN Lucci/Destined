[Verse 1]
I am, one bad muthafucker
Just a young fly nigga but you know I'm bout this cash muthafucker
Look I'm from where we jack muthafuckers
My tank on E and we ain't had no supper
My kids gotta eat, you know that K don't sleep
And when that K start to speak shit sound like it stutter
Hard body bitch you know I came out the gutter
Got fame and allot of gold chains off my hustle
Look how I came in last game fourth quarter
Gotta love the game Rich Porter
Only give a bitch good dick and some orders
Never take advice from a nigga who don't love ya
Gotta walk light, gotta stay above water
Everything good but shit done got harder
I rather eat last than to starve my nigga
Came in set the standards raised the bars on you niggas
I let you niggas get a head start on a nigga
Can't win gotta get smarter nigga
You can't win you'll never catch me not goin in
Every verse solid like mans
Who know fuckin' with the boy with the pen
Niggas know I'm the God.. Amen

[Hook]
This shit was destined for me, this shit was destined for me
I swear that they can see greatness in me
Yeah, they can see greatness in me
This shit gotta make me ain't no breakin' me
I hope this shit take me far as I can see
I swear this shit here was destined for me

[Verse 2]
Fuck who he is, what he done, fuck what he said nigga lyin'
If I ain't see it that ain't mean nun
These niggas be talkin' bout a whole lot of nun
Only time we playin' with them guns when we sprayin' some
Gotta gone head get it done
Can't play me better play with your son
How they gone beat me when I already won
They gone make me go Ace shit, niggas still hatin'
I'ma hit the mall bust down on my bracelet
I was down bad I ain't see too many faces
Gotta ball with the same crew I ate off the plate with
YFN all that I need, tell me who harder than me?
Tryna have a mill before my lil daughter turn three
Tryna have a mill before Wish Me Well 3
I am not in your league, I am out of your league
I can't do this for free man this shit guaranteed
This shit for me, I can do this in my sleep
I'm probably on weed and codeine
It was all just a dream, they never remember the smaller things
They don't know the problems that money brings
The money brings allot of things

[Hook]
This shit was destined for me, this shit was destined for me
I swear that they can see greatness in me
Yeah, they can see greatness in me
This shit gotta make me ain't no breakin' me
I hope this shit take me far as I can see
I swear this shit here was destined for me
