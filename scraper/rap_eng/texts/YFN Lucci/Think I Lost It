[Intro]
Think it's a game?
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do, do, uh, uh, yeah
Ayy, ayy
Uh, uh, hey
Ayy they gon' think I lost it, yeah, hey, hey
Uh, hey, lost what? Bitch, I ain't lost shit, hey, uh

[Chorus]
Ayy they gon' think I lost it, and the top, I lost it
Forgiato offset, and I'm drippin', faucet
Ayy they gon' think I lost it, they gon' think I lost it
And her top, she lost it, so the top, I lost it, yeah

[Verse 1]
This shit big as a Suburban, she never heard of it
I'm in both lanes just to swerve it, she puttin' that work in
Ayy, I got less than five percs and can't see a person
Ayy, if I had to pay for it girl, you know I'd purchase
Uh, let me purchase, let me, let me purchase
Buy her Fendi purses, buy Chanel and Birkin
Ayy that pack land on Thursday, so much, make you nervous
How you fly a bird in? How you fly a bird in?
Uh, ayy like 2Pac, I'm Birdie, huh
I just made a mil off servin'
I spent a whole mil on some jewelry, huh
I know only the real gon' feel me
And I know the deaf gon' hear
I'ma sleep on the mail this year, huh
Tryna have five M's this year
Have 'em lookin' like M, M, M

[Chorus]
Ayy they gon' think I lost it, and the top, I lost it
Forgiato offset, and I'm drippin', faucet
Ayy they gon' think I lost it, they gon' think I lost it
And her top, she lost it, so the top, I lost it, yeah

[Verse 2]
Okay, look, work it, bitch go'n and work it
I done threw 'bout me a quarter in this bitch on purpose
The way my wrist hurtin', probably broke it
And the bank, I broke it
I can't fuck no broke bitch
I can't stand my old bitch, yeah
Girl, come bend it over for me
Tell me what all you need
I won't tell you it's guaranteed
Now she yellin' out, "Marry me"
But I'm married to the money
Love carats like a bunny
In Paris with a bunny, yeah, look
Everything painted red, I got different bread
Got some white, wheat, honey oat, and Panera bread, yeah
Plus I'm thoroughbred, yeah, and my dogs fed, yeah
Plus my girl know I like that pussy bald head

[Chorus]
Ayy they gon' think I lost it (Lost it), and the top, I lost it (Lost it)
Forgiato offset, and I'm drippin', faucet
Ayy they gon' think I lost it, they gon' think I lost it
And her top, she lost it, so the top, I lost it, yeah
