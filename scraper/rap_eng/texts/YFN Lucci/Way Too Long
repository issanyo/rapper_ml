Pull up, don't be taking too long

Don't get it fucked up cause you see me smiling, lil bitch don't forget that I'm grown
Well I got no time to raise you, you should have got that at home
If I you know just send you to the answering machine why you calling the phone?
California reefer, I'm lighting blunts
I made 20,000 dollars a month
I made 80,000 dollars in jail
Most you niggas out here rookies and 12
Meanwhile, at the club, and I'm taking two home
Trapping right now, bitch I'm trapping, two phones
My Chevy one color, I paint it two-tone
We taking you off if you taking too long
Pull up right now, bitch, you taking too long
Pull up right now, bitch, you taking too long
Ride round the town with a K and two drones
That's how we rocking, the fuck is you from?
I'm from the business, I want a million
Find the work for cheap and make us a killin'
Stacking hundreds up to put in the ceiling
Spodee and Lucci really rock what they living
