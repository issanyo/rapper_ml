[Hook: YFN Lucci]
I got snakes all in my lawn so I gotta watch where I step
Everywhere I go I'm armed
Gangsta move in silence
Say umm I'm so calm
Say my palm keep itchin

[Verse 1: YFN Lucci]
I gotta get it
Riding round trynna get it
A dead man Im at they head man
Watch what you say man
You'll be a dead man before eleven
The mac eleven my best friend
And that F&N like my left hand
And it pump off in my sweatpants
Make a mess man I swear
I got a whole lot of these jeans
These balmains all that I wear
Gold bottoms, this gold all on me
Try to take it, I dare
Know Im strapped up in here
Know my nigga Killa in here
Know if anything pop off
We gon let some shots off
Fuck around catch a body in here
It was no other way
We had no time to play
Feel like I’m already late
Tell me who round this way
Shots straight pass everybody
They couldn't climb this way
Everywhere I change the climate
Look at my Diamonds bae

[Hook: YFN Lucci]
I got snakes all in my lawn
So I gotta watch where I step
See I step in foreign
Every shoe giuseppe
I got 8 whips in all
I got 8 whips they all cost
All my shit clean
Shit yeen even seen I dont even wear
I sip so much lean
My shit clean
I don't even share
Dope Boy Dreams
Hustle by any means
Nigga I swear

[Verse 2: YFN Kay]
Grew up in the trenches
Two cups of sydneys
Might fuck up my kidneys
Rolleys and bentleys
I dreamed about rolleys and bentleys
Made a nigga go and get it
I just had to go get it
On the ground with time
I know that the story was written
And they ain't thought it was written
Killer back in beast mode
Might turn ya chest into a B pole
More paper than King Cole
Scraps under my mink coat
Too many Glocks in here
You don’t want problems in here
No talking its silent in here
You will get swallowed in here
Remixing the drink like fuck what you thought
Love finessing the bank
I hustle like frank
Did what everybody can’t
I’m on the bullshit send a  nigga to the pulpit
If you told them then pull it and no said if it ain’t no true shit

[Hook: YFN Lucci]
I got snakes all in my lungs
So i gotta watch where i step
See i step in foreign
Every shoe Giuseppe
I got 8 whips in all
I got 8 whips they all cost
All my shit clean
Shit you ain't even seen I dont even wear
I sip so much lean
My shit so clean
I don't even share
Dope Boy Dreams
Hustle by any means
Nigga I swear
