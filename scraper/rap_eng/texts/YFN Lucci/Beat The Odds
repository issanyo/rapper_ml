[Chorus: Derez De'Shon]
I'm just tryna beat the odds, back against the wall
Laced my boots and stood up tall, told my niggas I won't fall
I'm just tryna beat the odds, yeah, yeah
I'm just tryna beat the odds, yeah, yeah
I'm just tryna beat the odds, back against the wall
Laced my boots and stood up tall, told my niggas I won't fall
I'm just tryna beat the odds, yeah, yeah
I'm just tryna beat the odds, yeah, yeah
I'm just tryna beat the odds, hey

[Verse 1: Derez De'Shon]
Uh, look at the cards, I was dealt from the start
I played 'em regardless (Yay)
I gave it my all, stayed down and I came up (Came up)
Never hated or changed up (Changed up)
Every day that I wake up (Wake up), I let God know I'm thankful (Thank the Lord)
'Cause I could've been dead or in prison
Free Drinkin' Juice, oh I miss him
Thoughts in my head got me trippin' (Yeah, yeah)
I be poppin' these meds, no prescription (Yeah, yeah)
All I see is head how I'm livin' (Yeah, yeah)
All of my prayers 'bout forgiveness (Yeah, yeah)
My bitch send me prayers out the scriptures
I swear I be scared when I miss 'em, ohh
No one ask Derez how he feelin', ohh
Go hard for DJ and Chariot, ohh
I'ma keep it G 'til I'm buried, hey, Derez De'Shon

[Chorus: Derez De'Shon]
I'm just tryna beat the odds, back against the wall
Laced my boots and stood up tall, told my niggas I won't fall
I'm just tryna beat the odds, yeah, yeah
I'm just tryna beat the odds, yeah, yeah
I'm just tryna beat the odds, back against the wall
Laced my boots and stood up tall, told my niggas I won't fall
I'm just tryna beat the odds, yeah, yeah
I'm just tryna beat the odds, yeah, yeah
I'm just tryna beat the odds, hey

[Verse 2: YFN Lucci]
Beat the odds, beat the charge, beat the streets apart
Self-employed, I'm that boy, baby I'm that boy
My Audemar cost me eighty large, bitch I beat the odds
And my yard filled with foreign cars, bitch I beat the odds, yeah
All these scars, bitch I had it hard, now I feel like God
All these broads wanna be with the boy, they tryna beat the odds
Can't believe I had to work a egg beater boy, yeah
Can't believe we used to weigh it in a beaker boy, yeah
Uh, cocaine flow, propane smoke, what you came for?
Ayy, pimp a bitch, get a dollar out a stank ho
And don't never let a nigga count your bankroll

[Chorus: Derez De'Shon]
I'm just tryna beat the odds, back against the wall
Laced my boots and stood up tall, told my niggas I won't fall
I'm just tryna beat the odds, yeah, yeah
I'm just tryna beat the odds, yeah, yeah
I'm just tryna beat the odds, back against the wall
Laced my boots and stood up tall, told my niggas I won't fall
I'm just tryna beat the odds, yeah, yeah
I'm just tryna beat the odds, yeah, yeah
I'm just tryna beat the odds, hey
