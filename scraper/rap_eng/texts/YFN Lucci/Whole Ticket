[Chorus: Q Money]
Carti on my lenses, baby my vision expensive
Ain't got time for these women, I'm tryna get me some millions
Don't call my phone lil nigga, unless you talkin' them chickens
I want a whole ticket, please bring me a whole ticket
I walk in in Givenchy, I look like a whole ticket
Was down bad on my last, I had no choice but go get it
These bitches gold diggin', I ain't got no feelings
I'm on a whole mission, I need a whole ticket

[Verse 1: Q Money]
Makin' cake, I can't hesitate, no time for mistakes
Ain't no breaks, I can't go on dates, fuck her then I skate
What I ate, lobster with the steak, that's my feng shui
Please don't hate, tryna motivate, I just wan' be great
I got swag, I cannot complain, look how far a nigga came
It feel just like yesterday I was trappin' out the section eight
Now a young nigga done switched his lane
I'm tryna buy some real estate
Please get the fuck out my face
Nigga all you do is hate (bitch)
You's a hater, nigga you's a hater
I'm tryna get a mansion and I want a hundred acres
I don't want no neighbors, can't keep doing favors
Shawty want me to save her, but I cannot save her

[Chorus: Q Money]
Carti on my lenses, baby my vision expensive
Ain't got time for these women, I'm tryna get me some millions
Don't call my phone lil nigga, unless you talkin' them chickens
I want a whole ticket, please bring me a whole ticket
I walk in in Givenchy, I look like a whole ticket
Was down bad on my last, I had no choice but go get it
These bitches gold diggin', I ain't got no feelings
I'm on a whole mission, I need a whole ticket

[Verse 2: YFN Lucci]
I need a whole ticket, I need like four bitches
I got one AP on, shit cost like four chickens, yeah
Don't fuck with gold diggin' little bitchs
I spent a pole on some extensions
All of my bros stay in the kitchen
Most of my bros good with the whippin'
Whole trolls in the lobby
I put that rose gold on her neck, she say it froze up her lil body
I got like five hoes tryna sex but I chose one 'cause she got sloppy, yeah
Bankroll on me sloppy, yeah
Pour some paint on her body, yeah, yeah, uh
Ayy Cartier my lenses, six K, I see clearly
I got one hell vision, I am one hell of a business man
I been tryna get it man, I been on my pivot
I been flyer than these niggas since the beginning, yeah-yeah

[Chorus: Q Money]
Carti on my lenses, baby my vision expensive
Ain't got time for these women, I'm tryna get me some millions
Don't call my phone lil nigga, unless you talkin' them chickens
I want a whole ticket, please bring me a whole ticket
I walk in in Givenchy, I look like a whole ticket
Was down bad on my last, I had no choice but go get it
These bitches gold diggin', I ain't got no feelings
I'm on a whole mission, I need a whole ticket

[Outro: YFN Lucci]
I need me a whole ticket
Look like a whole ticket, yeah, huh-huh-huh
My wrist here cost four chickens, yeah
Yeah, uhh
