Chopper make a skinny fat this that balloon trick
Boy Im pulling money out that bag, I got lots of swag
You ain't peeped the masaratis with them foreign tags
Its six zips off in the trunk cuz I ain't got no stash
Soon as I see the city, ima do the dash
I always had to go get it, nothing came to me
Being late was lame to me, I liked to lead the league
I be the first to admit it cuz I was first to go get it
We didn't play with them jimmy unless we went on a mission
Nine time out of ten we pull up and let them sixes go
Windows to the floor, Kay gone shoot it like a video
I just want the money and the cash, come up off that bag
You gone need a tag, you won't last if drugs all you had
Damn, that's a waste of time, and your rollie ain't shine with them cloudy ass diamonds
My chain shinin like city lights, come and find em
If you trying take look the other way and never mind em
Or that forty shine and blind em and lean em back never mind em
