Many men wish death upon me
Blood in my eyes dog and I can't see
But dollar signs in my eyes dog it's all that I see
If you ain't talking 'bout no money don't talk to me
I sleep with that 2-2-3 with me
I'll put a hole in a nigga for fucking with me
Gotta be cautious in these streets yea-yeah
Cause niggas are trying to take your life away
Many men many many many many many men yea yeah
Wish death upon me
No I don't cry, won't cry no
Oh yeah wish death
My back on the wall now you gon' see
Better watch how you talk when you talk about me
My back on the wall, yeah
Cause I come and take your life away
Many men wish death upon me
Blood in my eyes dog
But dollar signs in my eyes dog
If you ain't talking 'bout no money don't talk to me
