[Verse 1: Johnny Cinco]
I got your hoe in the back
I'm a lil foreign declare
You know I got the foreign lil mat
See I got a foreign lil bat
I gotta stop pouring that act
I gotta stop fucking with bitches
I gotta stop spending money
I gotta start saving these hundreds
I need some rain for the summer
I gotta spend time with my niggas
I gotta stay away from the bitches
In a trap house full of bitches
To a pent house full of riches
Trap house everyday
To a penthouse never play
New coupe in the rain
New coupe with the stains
Im a hood nigga but im famous
With a bad bitch and she famous
I dont really choose the famous
We dont really want your honey
We dont really want your rhymes
We ain't never seen you round'

[Bridge]
Gotta stop playin with them niggas
Gotta stop playing with them bitches
Gotta stop playing with that money
Young nigga tryna get richer
Young nigga tryna get fister
Young nigga tryna get fister
So much of the money I miss her
Run through the money I miss her

[Hook 1]
Gotta stop pouring the lean
Gotta stop pouring the drink
I want some more of the bank
I want some more of the riches
Ain't got no time for the bitches
I want some more for them niggas
I want some more for them niggas
Gotta stop pouring the lean
Gotta stop pouring the drink
I want some more of the bank
I want some more of the riches
I want some more for my greens
Ain't got no time for the bitches
Ain't got no time for the bitches

[Verse 2: Lucci]
I ain't got no time for these bitches (Yeah Yeah)
I swear I ain't got no time I gotta get it
Im pipe levels on the road
You know im always on the go
On the go I got goals
Ain't got time for these hoes
We pass these hoes give em go
Different struggle, different foe
Rain hail sleet and snow
Rain hell let em know
I gotta stop being friendly
Gotta stop fucking with these hoes
Gotta get close to my enemies
Fuck it if it ain't benefiting
Me and the money got intimate
Got the money now she into me
But I gotta stop playing

[Hook]
Gotta stop pouring the lean
Gotta stop pouring the drink
I want some more of the bank
I want some more of the riches
Ain't got no time for the bitches
I want some more for them niggas
I want some more for them niggas
Gotta stop pouring the lean
Gotta stop pouring the drink
I want some more of the bank
I want some more of the riches
I want some more for my greens
Ain't got no time for the bitches
Ain't got no time for the bitches
