[Chorus]
Uh, uh, you know we way up
I done lost my man on the way up
Lost a couple bands on the way up
Had to change the plans on the way up
Now I'm on my way up, can't wait to wake up, yeah
Every day a nigga on his way up
Tryna get there, when I get there, I'ma stay up
Yeah, I'm on my way up, yeah
Yeah, when you way up
What they gon' say when you way up?
Everybody gon' hate when you way up
I ain't at the top yet, I'm on the way up
On the way up, way up, yeah
I done came far I'm on the way up
Tryna get there I'm on the way up
I ain't at the top yet, I'm on my way up, yeah

[Verse 1]
What nigga want war with us?
Nigga talk shit but they quiet when they see me
I'm in that new thang, out ridin' like a genie
This a 450, this is not a Lamborghini
And they know that we gon' eat, we want business
Know that we gone beef 'bout a penny
Know if we don't eat, we don't sleep
Ain't no peace, we gon' creep with them semi's
That judge put a nigga in that chair like a dentist
Who you know on one leg still runnin' shit?
That chopper got a full ass drummer kit
My neck and wrist ear and my momma lit
Tryna cop another Benz before the summer hit
Now a nigga way, way up like a motherfuckin' blimp
We done had to came up, blowed up, got a grip
We done fuckin' blowed up, ayy, now we way up like a blimp
We done fuckin' blowed up, ayy, do it
Pull up in the coupe with the doors up, nigga
I done fucked your bitch with my homeboys, nigga
Got these hoes sewed up like a overall, nigga
Yeah and overall still I'm over y'all niggas
Uh, bank first place later, save now fuck later
Get the pussy, boy, gon' now fuck later
I'ma get the money now then fuck later, yeah

[Chorus]
Uh, uh, you know we way up
I done lost my man on the way up
Lost a couple bands on the way up
Had to change the plans on the way up
Now I'm on my way up, can't wait to wake up, yeah
Every day a nigga on his way up
Tryna get there, when I get there, I'ma stay up
Yeah, I'm on my way up, yeah
Yeah, when you way up
What they gon' say when you way up?
Everybody gon' hate when you way up

Tryna get there I'm on the way up

[Verse 2]
Uh, uh, I won't stop until I win
I don't fuck with no fake friends
Niggas talkin' blocks then we want in
Kick 'em off the block if he ain't comin' in
I remember when I came home vert
Remember puttin' change in my baby mama purse
I'm glad thangs changed and it ain't get worse
Them niggas tellin' names but that ain't gone work, yeah
Uh, I'm a motherfuckin' stoner
Whole hunnit to my mama, gave her a whole hunnit
That's a whole hunnit
Lil' nigga, I'm a roadrunner
Bust down on me, 50 whole pointers
Them niggas takin' swag, yeah, they stole from us
When we out of grass then the snow comin
I ain't gotta brag 'cause my numbers gon' show for me
Clearport, every time we flyin'
Know we get 'em 10 times 10 at a time
Them niggas talkin' mad, get my mans on the line
You know when my mans mad then everybody dyin'
Uh, now a nigga way, way up like a motherfuckin' blimp
We done fuckin' came up, blowed up
You a shrimp, they don't bring my name up
Niggas know they ain't us, yeah, ayy, uh

[Chorus]
Uh, uh, you know we way up
I done lost my man on the way up
Lost a couple bands on the way up
Had to change the plans on the way up
Now I'm on my way up, can't wait to wake up, yeah
Every day a nigga on his way up
Tryna get there, when I get there, I'ma stay up
Yeah, I'm on my way up, yeah
Yeah, when you way up, what they gon' say when you way up?
Everybody gon' hate when you way up

Niggas talk shit but they quiet when they see me
