[Intro]
Evil G

[Chorus: YFN Trae Pound & YFN Lucci]
You keep it real wit me, I keep it real wit you
A nigga fuck wit me huh, he gotta fuck wit you
Nigga hate but that paper gon keep on coming, straight to the top we gon keep on climbing
Ima show ya how to pop we gon keep on shining
Nigga get popped tryna keep on stunting
Ima show ya how to stunt we gon keep on counting
Show ya how to pop yeen seen this amount
Look pull up in the drop with the roof gone
Man we been fucked up for too long
Show ya how to pop yeen seen this amount
More than five hundred cash laying in the house
Got more than a mill sittin' in that count
And everything in the count never come out yeah

We struggled we made it we hustled all night till the day hit
We use to take shit even back then we'll go spray shit
We ain't never trip about who they hit
We ain't ever we ain't ever trip we beat them cases
Yeen ever yeen ever pulled up in the basement
Told ma we got them things in the basement
Told my man that cool if they ever move I replace it
Told my main dude we gon make it
If we ever lose we go ape shit
Whole lot of dudes from the crew who didn't make it
I don't really know what Ima do but whatever we do we gotta face it
Whole lotta tool for my safety, know I'm dippin' through in the latest
Know I drip the jewels know I'm cool as a glacier
Know a nigga put you on the news for the paper

[Chorus: YFN Trae Pound & YFN Lucci]
You keep it real wit me, I keep it real wit you
A nigga fuck wit me huh, he gotta fuck wit you
Nigga hate but that paper gon keep on coming, straight to the top we gon keep on climbing
Ima show ya how to pop we gon keep on shining
Nigga get popped tryna keep on stunting
Look Ima show ya how to stunt we gon keep on counting
Show ya how to pop yeen seen this amount
Look pull up in the drop with the roof gone
Man we been fucked up for too long
Show ya how to pop yeen seen this amount
More than five hundred cash laying in the house
Got more than a mill sittin' in that count
And everything in the count never come out yeah

[Verse 2: YFN Trae Pound]
Tell ya why these niggas can't figure it out
Too much money ain't enough need a bigger amount
I was just wit ya son when my nigga was out
I remember thuggin' we was ten deep in the house
Nowhere to sleep in the house
Dreaming bout it, now the shit right in front ya eyes
My only aim is to inspire
I want none but the best for everyone and my guy
Room full of bitches we gon fuck 'em one at a time
Homie change on me it hurt me inside but if you think I lost sleep nigga that's a lie
Gotta keep a thirty and a forty every time I slide
And if you think it's sweet nigga better think twice
And if you talkin' beef nigga we gon eat twice
Nigga play wit me he gon need christ
VVS1's you don't need no lights
We can go bar for bar nigga I'm nice

[Chorus: YFN Trae Pound & YFN Lucci]
You keep it real wit me, I keep it real wit you
A nigga fuck wit me huh, he gotta fuck wit you
Nigga hate but that paper gon keep on coming, straight to the top we gon keep on climbing
Ima show ya how to pop we gon keep on shining
Nigga get popped tryna keep on stunting
Ima show ya how to stunt we gon keep on counting
Show ya how to pop yeen seen this amount
Look pull up in the drop with the roof gone
Man we been fucked up for too long
Show ya how to pop yeen seen this amount
More than five hundred cash laying in the house
Got more than a mill sittin' in that count
And everything in the count never come out yeah
