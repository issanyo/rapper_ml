[Chorus]
Uh, I know my niggas all (down, down) yeah yeah
Aye my bitches gon' hold me (down, down)
Yeah, I know they got love for the boy

See they know where I came from they know I had it hard
Yeah, see I got up but we were (down, down) yeah hey

All them nights a nigga starved turned me to a machine

[Verse 1]
Aye we waited too long for this know we stayed (down, down)
See now I'm way up remember we were way (down, down)
No matter where I go they know I always held it (down, down)
And no matter where I go they know that we gon' blow it, down
That Plain Jane I can't wait to bust it down (down, down)
And you know we cashin' out on cars nigga ain't no puttin' (down, down)
A long way from them squad up search nigga I'm Louis'd down

To tell the truth, the whole fam I would die for
Get on me some Suge shit, inject him with the die slow
Uh, we ain't gotta hide no, need no disguise no

Yeah, see I got up but we were (down, down) yeah hey
They picked me up when I was (down, down) yeah
I got love for the team, can't let nothin' intervene yeah
All them nights a nigga starved turned me to a machine
