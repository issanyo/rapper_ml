[Intro]
It's sacrilegious, you know
I've always been 'bout my mofuckin' paper
Yeah
Greatness
You know how it work
YFNBC, Think It's A Game
It's not a game

[Hook]
I can't see nobody stoppin' us, yeah, we unstoppable
Went through a whole lot of obstacles
I swear we did the impossible
Run up that paper then fuck it up
Go hit the club and then fuck it up
A whole lot of packs we gone get it back
You know we gone get it back
I can't see nobody stoppin' us
I stop em' I stop em' unstoppable
Run up that paper then get it, whatever it take we gone get it
You know ain't nobody stoppin' us
Mafia, mafia, mafia, all of my niggas they mafia
Thought I told you we unstoppable

[Verse 1]
I just spent a brick on my Jesus, you gotta put God first
I swear I turned â€˜em to believers, this shit came from hard work
Gotta hustle, stay down with your people
Can't betray the one who feed you
No competition we are equal
Can't let nobody mislead you
Lil Ray Ray from Summerhill, it's only one of him
Zoo Atlanta nun but lions here
We was raised not to have a fear
When Nut died shed so many tears
So many nights I cried and cried I swear
So many nights I cried and cried I swear
All of these niggas lame
Photo ready but without the frame
Just spent a quarter on my wrist and chain
If you get caught you bet not mention names
Blowin' more smoke than a train
That red be keepin' me stained
Unstoppable I am untamed, I am unstoppable just like the train

[Hook]
I can't see nobody stoppin' us we unstoppable
Went through a whole lot of obstacles
I swear we did the impossible
Run up that paper then fuck it up
Go hit the club and then fuck it up
A whole lot of packs we gone get it back
You know we gone get it back
I can't see nobody stoppin' us
I stop em' I stop em' unstoppable
Run up that paper then get it, whatever it take we gone get it
You know ain't nobody stoppin' us
Mafia, mafia, mafia, all of my niggas they mafia
Thought I told you we unstoppable

[Verse 2]
I can't see nobody stoppin' us
Mafia, mafia, mafia
I can't see nobody, all of this money, swear all of this money keep blockin' them
Swear all these hunnits I'll die for them, you know all of my partners swear I'll die them
Fuck around and spend a block with them
Swear I only hang with them shottas, yeah see you know we came with them choppers
Yeah, remember them days we had not a thing now we pouring up drink and poppin' champagne
Nigga this what it is I can't fuck with you lames
The power, the money, the cars, the hoes, the fame
I, made a vow to my dawgs I'll never change
This that real mafia shit, put some lil guap on ya clique
Add a lil 30 on top and they toppin' ya shit
You know I'm on top of my shit
Gotta show em' what unstoppable is
Sorry Lord, but it's kill or be killed
If a nigga switch then that's on him
Can't let no bullshit interfere

[Hook]
I can't see nobody stoppin' us we unstoppable
Went through a whole lot of obstacles
I swear we did the impossible
Run up that paper then fuck it up
Go hit the club and then fuck it up
A whole lot of packs we gone get it back
You know we gone get it back
I can't see nobody stoppin' us
I stop em' I stop em' unstoppable
Run up that paper then get it, whatever it take we gone get it
You know ain't nobody stoppin' us
Mafia, mafia, mafia, all of my niggas they mafia
Thought I told you we unstoppable
