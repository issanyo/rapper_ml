[Verse 1]
Look, I'm gonna get this paper for sure, yeah
You don't know my story or my emotions
Don't tell me that you love me than let go
Don't tell me that it's too far like I can't go
I ain't gonna tell you about no lost man, I grew up
I ain't gonna play about my dog, like he was Kujo
I've been playing with that raw, just can't cook up
I been cutting these hoes off like a butcher
And like we playin' ball, I got 'em shook up
You don't believe I'm ten feet tall, the way they look up, to me
And I don't gotta lie, I gotta stay surrounded by some G
And I ain't gotta lie, my yard, got a whole lot of V
I'm gon' get paper, don't need no handouts
Talking so rich, won't need her at all
Yeah we out here camouflage on, we still gonna stand out
Give a fuck about your squad nigga, we don't stand down

[Refrain]
I'm not standing
I said, oh eight, just some bandits
Yeah, broke my ankle fell off a bench
Yeah, all these scars I need me a bandaid
Yeah, I gotta go hard I was a abandoned

[Verse 2]
Oh my baby mama love me, and my ex bitch she can't stand me
Claim my girl love me, sometimes she wanna vanish
I try and give her all my heart, but I see she couldn't manage it
Yeah, that's my biggest problem with relation
Yeah, when I fuck that girl, I ask if she can take it
Yeah, fuck the judge, we be smoking on probation
Yeah, fuck her good, had her squirting all day
And you know I fucked her good

[Chorus]
Raindrop, you know that pussy good If I call later
Don't tell me that you hate me,  just to make up
Been switching, say you love me then you a trader
Yeah, how say you want love but you a hater

[Verse 3]
You say you want love, but you out fucking for paper
Blowing my phone up, but you won't do me not one favor
How you brought it up, but you know you gone push up later
Yeah, yeah okay look true enough
Look how everything I do, just ain't never enough
Girl, if I buy this ring, bitch I need groupie love
Girl, call me I can be the one you open up too
Yeah, push up I can be the one that you can run to

[Chorus]
Raindrop, you know that pussy good If I call later
Don't tell me that you hate me,  just to make up
Been switching, say you love me  you a trader
Yeah, how say you want love but you a hater

[Outro]
Yeah, how say you want love but you a hater
You know that pussy good If I call later
You know that pussy good If I call later
You know that pussy good If I call later
