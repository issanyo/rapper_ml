[Intro]
Know what I'm sayin'
2 Chainz and that boy Wayne in here
You know, dream big go hard nigga you know
Fuck I came to do

[Verse 1]
Yeah, look, I did Collegrove
If I drop an album, already sold, yeah
Look, I swear I'll never sell my soul
I make them feel it in a nigga's soul
Look, okay you nigga still tryna go gold
Swear I ain't ever goin' gold
Only thing gold is my wrist and my neck and my load
And the safe but, you'll never crack the code
At the clear port, waitin' on the jet to unload
Waitin' on the next nigga to fold
From the project to the pro
Only thing bitch about the nigga, is my motherfuckin' hoe
I just bought my BM a new mink coat
Gave her the petite that I needed a link for
Whole lot of paper like we workin' at Kinko
And we used to be broke, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
Struggling
I ain't even have nothing
Turned nothing into something
Back in the day we were thugging
I remember we ain't have nothing
I remember we were hustling
I remember we were struggling
We was always up to something, yeah

[Chorus]
Damn, I've been broke before
I said damn, I've been broke before, yeah
I don't know if you've ever been broke before
Have you ever been broke before? Yeah
Damn, we were broke before
Can't believe we were broke before, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, uh-huh

[Verse 2]
Uh, big bottle full of champagne
100 bottles we don't even drink, yeah
Look how far a young nigga came
Look how far a young nigga came, yeah
Bit down know you smell the campaign
Bit called lil' boy but I got some damn weight
Pull up in the down tank, make me go rampage
Jimmy Choo, we don't shop at Champs, man
Cartier all, I'm official
All of my dawgs, they official
All of my dawg got, all of my dawg we will kill here
Why play play with us when we all like Hitler?
Uh, two time for them real ones
And to them fake nigga, fuck 'em all, we don't feel 'em
And to whoever wanna get involved, we don't fear nothin', yeah
One call everybody gone kill somethin'
I remember days in the trey as a little one
Runnin' round with TJ, tryna pierce somethin'
Now we run into the jet, yeah, the lil' one
100K on my neck, yeah, the real one
That Audemar Piguet, I'm Bobby Boucher
I'm with my goon today, so what will you say?
200 grand walkin' through TSA
You wouldn't believe where a nigga used to stay

[Pre-Chorus]
Struggling
I ain't even have nothing
Turned nothing into something
Back in the day we were thugging
I remember we ain't have nothing
I remember we were hustling
I remember we were struggling
We was always up to something, yeah

[Chorus]
Damn, I've been broke before
I said damn, I've been broke before, yeah
I don't know if you've ever been broke before
Have you ever been broke before? Yeah
Damn, we were broke before
Can't believe we were broke before, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, uh-huh
