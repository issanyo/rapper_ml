I woke up this morning with you on my mind
She say she don't miss me, I know that she lying
I can see straight through that girl like a window no blinds, yeah
All that fronting don't get left behind
I said girl stop that frontin, let me get behind
I used to have that girl running, like she 'bout her miss her ride
Had her screamin' like when she terrified
She got that water I'm talking purified, oohh
Do you remember those nights
We was fussin' and fightin', then be fuckin' all night
I know you remember those night
Can't forget not a night, with me, alright
I put that pussy on me she love when I kiss her
And its some boud them rings she got in her nipples
I miss her, I miss her, I miss her, I miss
I will always remember her like a riddle
Still think about the things I did to her
I can't wait to get off this tour
I'ma fuck you on the bed then the floor
In the shower have you pinned to the wall, yeahh
I say answer me girl
Do you ever dream of me?
I need answers
She say she love the way that I kiss on her neck
Grab her hair and hit it from the back
Say girl don't you love when we attach
And she know I don't tolerate no disrespect
I say you better answer me girl
I'ma need answers right now
I say you better answer me girl
Scrolling down my call log
They say I'm in love dawg
Who give a dam when they all call
Drop them panties like a Sprint call
See they say hoes be ya downfall
I still get in they mouth like some dam Halls
See they talkin' bout us nigga dam y'all
I got her ripping and running through these dam malls
See she can get anything she just gotta call
If anything she ain't never telling me nawl
Three songs she ain't even count me out yeahh
It was 3 some ain't even pull out
She say she love the way that I kiss on her neck
Grab her hair and hit her from the back
Say girl don't you love when we attach
And she know I don't tolerate no disrespect
I say you better answer me girl
I'ma need answers right now
I say you better answer me girl, right now
I say answer me girl
Do you ever dream of me?
I need answers
Yeahh
