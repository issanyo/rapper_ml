[Hook]
So much shit got me traumatized
I think im traumatized
See all this pain in a nigga eyes
You better not look in a nigga eyes
Thinkin' bout a homicide (2x)
Im not wit' the questions don't ask me why (2x)
I swear i tried to told em' but they didn't wanna listen
What the truth is, im the truth thats the difference
Where the roof is, damn the roof done went missin'
FN end on a nigga extended
Shit got me traumatized
I think im traumatized (2x)

[Verse 1]
When i say i love my bitch, i love bitch
When i say look what i did
You motherfuckas better look what i did
When i say the phantom came wit so many curtains
Closed the curtains make it look like i hid
Drop the top, pop the lid
I been the boy since a motherfuckin' kid
On top like the box on kid
If you still hatin' need to stop yo shit
See i ain't gotta lie about shit
Still runnin' wit' the same niggas that i came wit'
Prolly wit' a bitch speaking different language
Never had shit so i gotta have it
I was in the booth like i was in a gym everyday
Workin' out tryna get fit
See they say practice makes perfect
See im always workin' nigga which one you workin'
Gotta couple goons and they always lurkin'
Drop a bag on ya head, yea nigga birkin (wait)
Now ya lil' mans out of service
Im on now i got my own service
My bro prolly out somewhere servin'
If it ain't about money we ain't worried

[Hook]


[Verse 2]
Stupid bitch always trippin'
On some vacation shit
I tried to tell her but she didn't wanna listen
Sometimes i hate the bitch
And these niggas kill me act like i ain't do it first
Niggas still sleepin' wake em' up like an alert (wait)
Bomb bigger than a universe
And i ain't drop shit but the top on the vert
People gon hate, gon let em' hate
Big face rollie lotta big faces
Big Glock 40 on a nigga waist
I promise wit' the lead you can get erased
I promise when i led ima win the race
Since the begining been a winner
Im tryna fuck the game up fo' forever
This is not the end lil' nigga
Might move Frita out to Berlin
This a R8 that im in
They told me be patient you'll win
I got em' waitin' again
I put my hoes in red bottoms
I pulled yo hoe and my hoe right beside her
I am the one the like that no one behind em'
You looking for greatness you found em'
