[Intro: Bigga Rankin]
Real nigga, real nigga, real nigga radio
See all a real player need is a good girl and a bag
The moral of the story is, give me a rider and a provider and watch me run up a sack

[Chorus: Law G]
All I ever wanted was a good girl
But I only stay attractin' all the bad ones
And it's so hard for me to keep a good girl
'Cause I stay fuckin' nothin' but the bad ones
It's so hard, and all I ever wanted
Was a girl that's gon' give me one hundred
It's so hard, and all I ever wanted
Was a girl that don't do it for the money
It's so hard

[Verse 1: Law G]
All a nigga wanted was that real one, put you on some real ones
Keep it one hundred, we gon' build some
She said she ain't in the mood to fuck but she still come
I be in her hood, like pull up, and she still come
Flexin' on my ex, I know she get the message
Always out the country, Young Fly Niggas
Copped her somethin' foreign just to slide in it
We don't do no talkin', we just buyin' bitches
You a good girl but don't act like you is
You a good girl but you bad like a Jackson
Can't you see the nigga goin' hard for you?
No love, breakin' hella hearts for you
And I'm lookin' for a rider (lookin' for a rider)
Baby what you ride for? (baby what you ride for?)
Switching lanes, duckin' five-oh (skrrt)
Take you anywhere you wanna go (yeah, for real)

[Chorus: Law G]
All I ever wanted was a good girl
But I only stay attractin' all the bad ones
And it's so hard for me to keep a good girl
'Cause I stay fuckin' nothin' but the bad ones
It's so hard, and all I ever wanted
Was a girl that's gon' give me one hundred
It's so hard, and all I ever wanted
Was a girl that don't do it for the money
It's so hard

[Verse 2: YFN Lucci]
All I ever wanted was to, keep it one hundred with her
Dolce Gabbana on her, go drop some pointers on her, hey uh
Treat her like the bank and drop some commas on her, yeah
You know I do what they can't, you know the ball runner, yeah, uh
If you a million miles away, you know I'm comin' for you
Okay, don't never let 'em tell you that I ain't for you
Like I don't treat you like my baby, like you ain't spoiled, yeah, ayy
And all I ever wanted was somethin' real for you
Don't ever let 'em tell you I ain't here for you
I can't even explain how I feel for you, yeah

[Chorus: Law G]
All I ever wanted was a good girl
But I only stay attractin' all the bad ones
And it's so hard for me to keep a good girl
'Cause I stay fuckin' nothin' but the bad ones
It's so hard, and all I ever wanted
Was a girl that's gon' give me one hundred
It's so hard, and all I ever wanted
Was a girl that don't do it for the money
It's so hard (hey)

[Outro: Law G & YFN Lucci]
All I ever wanted was a good girl
(All I ever wanted, yeah)
All I ever wanted was a good girl
(I can't even explain, all I ever wanted)
And all I ever wanted (was a good girl)
It's so hard
And all I ever wanted (It's so hard)
