[Verse 1: Johnny Cinco]
I keep it real even when the love fake
Swear I see hate so much I'm starting to love hate
I took that loss the day I felt my heart break
Been down so long its only right I ball man
Got 50 thousand stuffed inside these Balmains
Been in that trap house I been countin' all down
Been in that trap house I been out here all day
Just pulled that Bentley to the hood on broad day
Young nigga count it all day
They know I'm Sakreligious all day
I know they hate cause it been like that always

[Chorus: Johnny Cinco]

[Verse 2: YFN Lucci]
Fake love, fake love
Why we make love when it ain't love?
What you like being fake for?
Girl you make a nigga hate love, aw
Break up and make up
Why you always try and fuck me girl
When you make my heart break up like you can put it back in place girl
I don't love you like I used to way back
But I love how you used to ride it like you was on a race track
Whippin' in that pussy like I'm tryna bring sum yay back
I know you somewhere wishin' that you could get them days back
Yeah, uh, like I used to
She know that head have me gone like that juice do
She had me water like in Florida so I cruise thru
But I don't love her like I used to, oh no
