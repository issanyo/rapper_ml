[Intro: Bigga Rankins]
Growin' up, my mama explained the difference between fame and notoriety
See fame is when people know you
Notoriety is when people know your work
And notoriety leave a legacy
When they talk about us
When they talk about big arrangements
When they talkin' 'bout Lucci
When they talkin' 'bout TIG
Some will hate, some will cheer
All will know one thing
My nigga Nut, we came and changed the music game forever

[Chorus: YFN Lucci]
Lately I been chasin' paper, chasin' guap, yeah, yeah
Lately I been feelin' like fuck a hater, fuck a cop, yeah, yeah
I swear lately I been heartless, heartless, heatless, heartless, yeah
Lately I been heartless, heartless, heartless, heartless, yeah

[Verse 1: YFN Lucci]
Oh hell nah, ain't no pressure 'bout no beef, we gon' air shit out
I got your bitch and she tellin' me all your where about's
Loadin' this K, I can't wait to go and spray one out
Uh-huh, I been hustlin' all day tryna get that cake up out it
All day, all day, I been ridin' it with it all day
It ain got no safe, it ain't got no safe, ayy
Y'all niggas play it safe, we gon' hit your safe, ayy
I got niggas in MIA and they'll hit your face
Uh, uh , I been a thug all my life, wanted a plug all my life
We had to move around with them pipes, we had to shoot it out some nights
Ain't no pressure 'bout no beef, know we love dinner
Fuck nigga, don't make me put a slug in 'em

[Chorus: YFN Lucci]
Lately I been chasin' paper, chasin' guap, yeah, yeah
Lately I been feelin' like fuck a hater, fuck a cop, yeah, yeah
I swear lately I been heartless, heartless, heatless, heartless, yeah
Lately I been heartless, heartless, heartless, heartless, yeah

[Verse 2: Rick Ross]
We located and got a bigger palace on the water
Pull up to club, I toss valet a couple hunnid
Women in abundance, I got to fuck 'em by appointments
Pray that bundle come from Haiti, I'ma give you what you wanted
I fucked her in the park, now we fuckin' on the jet
You fuckin' with my squad, I'ma put that shit to rest
Studied all these niggas 'cause this life is just a test
I need my hunnit million, you can't tell me nothing less
They gave my nigga 10 the lawyer, say he did the best
These streets ain't where you wanna be and Rozay told you that
The only natural talent niggas had was being violent
If a nigga take my life, I pray he see me smilin', boss

[Chorus: YFN Lucci]
Lately I been chasin' paper, chasin' guap, yeah, yeah
Lately I been feelin' like fuck a hater, fuck a cop, yeah, yeah
I swear lately I been heartless, heartless, heartless, heartless, yeah
Lately I been heartless, heartless, heartless, heartless, yeah
