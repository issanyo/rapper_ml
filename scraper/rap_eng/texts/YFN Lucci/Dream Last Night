[Intro: Ralo]
Yeah, I had a dream
YFN, I had a dream last night
Famgoon, yeah

[Chorus: Ralo & YFN Lucci]
Bro I had a dream last night, that everything went right
You better not fuck with my brother, shoot everything in sight
I told 'em gon' and free Trouble, that my thief in the night
Forgive me for what I'm doing, I'm just keeping it right
I got my money right, yeah, money right, damn right, yeah
I'm alright, yeah, all my ice out your price, yeah
Count it twice, yeah, I don't want it if it ain't right, yeah
Uh, I just knew you wasn't right, yeah

[Verse 1: Ralo]
I know that none of these niggas right
Take every one of these niggas' lifes
Play with the bro and I'm shooting on sight
We gon' shine, we gon' shine bright
In a different club every night
We ain't stopping at red lights
Rich as fuck off dog food
I'm the niggas that the feds like
I won't be Meech, I won't be Terry
I won't be the nigga locked up
Every time they book me for a show
I get a twenty just to pop up
Every time that I post a picture
I am every nigga's mood
Even when I wasn't in school
Freshest nigga in the room
Freshest nigga in the classroom
Got the world screaming famgoon
Put the world on that ahk shit
Got the world getting it tattooed
Where I came from, got my name from
Got the game in a blender
Had a dream last night
It wasn't right for my nigga

[Chorus: Ralo & YFN Lucci]
Bro I had a dream last night, that everything went right
You better not fuck with my brother, shoot everything in sight
I told 'em gon' and free Trouble, that my thief in the night
Forgive me for what I'm doing, I'm just keeping it right
I got my money right, yeah, money right, damn right, yeah
I'm alright, yeah, all my ice out your price, yeah
Count it twice, yeah, I don't want it if it ain't right, yeah
Uh, I just knew you wasn't right, yeah

[Verse 2: Ralo]
Something told me that you wasn't right, I knew it
I'm coming home tonight, that pusssy good
You know I take care all my niggas like a real one should
You know my niggas still my niggas if we get into it
They wonder why I do it
Why I got so much money and still live in the hood
Why I go through so much and I kick it like I'm good
They don't like me, I guess that I'm misunderstood
I told my bitch that I love her, she better not ever leave me
Never keep it, not even your deepest secrets
You need to tell me you love me even when we beefin'
I'm achieving, everything that I was dreamin'
Bitch I'm breathin'

[Chorus: Ralo & YFN Lucci]
Bro I had a dream last night, that everything went right
You better not fuck with my brother, shoot everything in sight
I told 'em gon' and free Trouble, that my thief in the night
Forgive me for what I'm doing, I'm just keeping it right
I got my money right, yeah, money right, damn right, yeah
I'm alright, yeah, all my ice out your price, yeah
Count it twice, yeah, I don't want it if it ain't right, yeah
Uh, I just knew you wasn't right, yeah

[Outro: Ralo]
Yeah, I had a dream
I had a dream last night
Famgoon, yeah
