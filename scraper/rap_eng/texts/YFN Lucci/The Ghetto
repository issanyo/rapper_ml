[Hook]
Before I go to bed I pray to the Lord
How the hell they make a million dollars unemployed
All this Codeine got a nigga paranoid
All this money got a nigga paranoid
I can't sleep, I can't wait
In that molly switchin' lanes
Money drove the kid insane, I can't let go
I wonder if Heaven got a ghetto
We just tryin to make it out the ghetto

[Verse 1: Johnny Cinco]
I can't sleep, I can't lay
On the chase, on the race
[?]
We just tryin to find our way
So we trap state to state, get this pay, never late
We on time, we gon shine, and we grind, wait in line
Pay no mind, that's on mine
The Rollie ain't never on time
You took the money I'm blind pay the fuck nigga no mind
I'm goin crazy bout mine pull up Maybach Mercedes bout mine
Young nigga stayed on the grind
Patient I waited my time
She want a kid with the trapper
She want to lick on the rapper
She say the money ain't a factor
I beat the pussy and pass her I hope you not a arouser
I think she in love with my swagger
I put that thing into that mouth
That was the end of that chapter

[Hook]
Before I go to bed I pray to the Lord
How the hell they make a million dollars unemployed
All this Codeine got a nigga paranoid
All this money got a nigga paranoid
I can't sleep, I can't wait
In that molly switchin' lanes
Money drove the kid insane, I can't let go
I wonder if Heaven got a ghetto
We just tryin to make it out the ghetto

[Verse 2: YFN Lucci]
We just tryin to make it out the hood
Robin Hood
Robbin niggas for they goods
I just want all my niggas good
What's understood is understood, yea I wish a nigga would
If I say do it, he'll prolly do it, don't make me do it
And we straight from the jet rockin' Rolex
Want respect gon make they neck fresh
Out the street hopped on a jet
Now that's progress
And I never really played checkers I played chess
Yo best bet to be at yo best
When we connect won't break a sweat in retrospect
And I swear we wanted more I love the taste
He got that molly then I want to race
My car white I don't care bout no race
This is a phantom I just want to race
We got that shipment from out of the states
And I swear this shit was imported it's not where I stay

[Hook]
Before I go to bed I pray to the Lord
How the hell they make a million dollars unemployed
All this Codeine got a nigga paranoid
All this money got a nigga paranoid
I can't sleep, I can't wait
In that molly switchin' lanes
Money drove the kid insane, I can't let go
I wonder if Heaven got a ghetto
We just tryin to make it out the ghetto
