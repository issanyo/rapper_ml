[Chorus: YFN Lucci]
I swear I'm fuckin' with you, baby

Wouldn't have that shit no other way, hey
Girl won't you come run up this cake with me

Callin' while we talkin' right now, I'm ballin' like Milwaukee
Yeah, ballin' no Milwaukee right now
Ballin' no Milwaukee yeah, money steady callin' right now

[Verse 1: Trouble]
How 'bout we wake up from the penthouse (let's do it)
Be careful, you playin'
Skoob come take ya bitch out (let's go!)

Sometimes I'm gonna need space babe
Let's have a play play
Versace belt, you get the big face
Now you got the big head
Text me like "where ya at big head"
Oh you want the big head (sheesh)
(?)
You'll be my bitch then
Money keep calling
Then I'm having time reason we ballin'
Oh she like the bucks, Milwaukee
We fight then we fuck ain't it awesome
Thing is she don't do too much talking
Yea, yea I'm telling ya

Panties still on, I get you in yo zone
I know what you ready for
You know what I'm ready for

[Chorus: YFN Lucci]
I swear I'm fuckin' with you, baby

Wouldn't have that shit no other way, hey
Girl won't you come run up this cake with me
It's like right now that money callin' while we talkin', hey

Ballin' no Milwaukee yeah, money steady callin' right now

[Verse 2: YFN Lucci]
Uh, I didn't get here on my own
But I got my own
Lately I've been on the road, lately I've been on the road
Back to back number 1's 2 years in a row
You was fuckin' with me when I was broke
When I was broke, so anything that you need girl let me know
Just let me know yeah and never ever tell me no
Yeah and when we fuckin' hold me tighter and never and never and never let go yeah
I got my eye on you like a scope
I need a mail in my rope, or maybe a centerfold
She be comin' so fast when I be hittin' it slow
You got water girl then I'ma row your boat
20 thousand karats for these damn coats
I'm a flyer nigga what they ask for
I don't need no muthafuckin' passport
When the money call I'ma answer yeah
When the money call I'ma answer yeah yeah

[Chorus: YFN Lucci]
I swear I'm fuckin' with you, baby
I got my own shit girl come stay with me
Wouldn't have that shit no other way, hey
Girl won't you come run up this cake with me
It's like right now that money callin' while we talkin', hey
Callin' while we talkin' right now, I'm ballin' like Milwaukee
Yeah, ballin' no Milwaukee right now
Ballin' no Milwaukee yeah, money steady callin' right now
Money steady callin', hey
Money steady callin'
