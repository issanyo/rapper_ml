[Intro: YFN Lucci]
Ness on the beat
We ain't waste no time, you know it hard to be great you gotta go hard or go home nigga, and we ain't never going home nigga, ya know

[Chorus: YFN Lucci]
When shit get rough just keep your head up
Gotta keep going boy you better yeah yeah
Ima grind hard I know it's levels yeah
I swear I came too far for me to settle yeah
Ima hustle hard cause I want better yeah yeah
Even when it rough I kept my head up
I know I could never be a failure yeah
I was trying hard cause I want better yeah
Even when it rough gotta keep ya head up

[Verse 1: YFN Lucci]
Raindrops on my head, steppin' in puddles, lord what have I did
Why I have to suffer
Lord we only kids, lord save me and my brothers
And all of my friends, and all of my kins
I turned a thousand to ten
Turned that Nissan to a Benz
They told me grind and I did
Aye why you round if, you ain't tryna die by this shit
Don't come around nigga I ain't got a dollar to lend
I done put down that lil' pen
Now it's straight off the top just bought a Rari and the brains are off the top
I got a bad lil' bitch she comin' out her house to top
And I done lost it all but I ain't never dropped the ball

[Chorus: YFN Lucci]
When shit get rough just keep your head up
Gotta keep going boy you better yeah yeah
Ima grind hard I know it's levels yeah
I swear I came too far for me to settle yeah
Ima hustle hard cause I want better yeah yeah
Even when it rough I kept my head up yeah
I know I could never be a failure yeah
I was trying hard cause I want better yeah
Even when it rough gotta keep ya head up

[Verse 2: T.I.]
Handle business, give a dime, put ignition even if the cameras in it fuck nigga yeah
Trappin' at Southwest Atlanta still belong on television (my god)
Been to hell and back my bottom bitch didn't even have a pot to piss in
The lottery I gotta hit it or them block pigeons so my mama ain't gotta wash dishes
Bet you can't breathe need oxygen say I fell off nigga wait a hot minute
On the block brand new drop wit the lil bad bitch just hopped in it
'Fore you talk bigger than the top ten, legendary status I been locked in it, I'm not finished
If you livin' in a glass house watch where you throw your rocks at
Remember only sucka niggas have his hand hid, tryna never get your way through manhood
Keep your daughter off canned good
Always thank God no matter what cause where I came from shit feel damn good

[Chorus: YFN Lucci]
When shit get rough just keep your head up
Gotta keep going boy you better yeah yeah
Ima grind hard I know it's levels yeah
I swear I came too far for me to settle
Ima hustle hard cause I want better yeah yeah
Even when it rough I kept my head up
I know I could never be a failure yeah uh
I was trying hard cause I want better yeah
Even when it rough gotta keep ya head up
