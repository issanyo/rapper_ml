[Intro]
I said look at me kid
All this ice will make you free like the cops do
Tryna take my shine and I'll poop a dude
Clown ass Niggas you look like a fool
Look at my jewels I lit up the room
Hey my Niggas playing with sticks
Look like it's a broom same size as a broom
How they firing brooms
Don't play with me we got lots of platoons
Shut the fuck up when I'm in the room

[Verse 1]
OK a real Nigga talking don't you be so rude
You better not even fuckin sneeze if you ain't excuse
And these Niggas really be trippin
Don't you step on my shoes
Putting bitches over money you must be confused
Listen dude money talking my shit like the gossip
When they get jealous them Niggas will try to stop ya
For real but all my Niggas with me who gone stop us claiming they shooters
They was on the block when they got shot up
Claiming that they real but they not us
Ok I love telling my mother that I got us
I swear when dad was never home my mother
She never spent the night without us that's
Why I love telling my mother that I got us

[Hook]
Look what I did I turned the dream into reality
They said I'm heading to the top that's where I rather
Be chasing paper nobody fast as me
I had to get it nothing came to me
I swear I always knew I was always gone be successful plus I can't wait to ice out my new Bezel
For real and all my Niggas eating time for extra
And you talking about hoes we got several

[Verse 2]
I got some Niggas that can't wait to see me
Off in the game they say it need me
I never bite the hand that feed me
Wasn't that greedy might still ride around
In that hoopie pray they don't see me
And if my baby ever need me I come speedin
Believe me i swear can't wait to tell her
I been through hell like times when mom
Asked for a dime and I couldn't help her
They got my Nigga Ramone riding free my lil brother
I swear my cuz just came home
From a dime it's getting better
I swear I got this shit like it was sent to me
And it better be about green if you mention me
I might just fuck up the scene if you mention me remember me the same Nigga
I ain't let nobody do shit to me

[Hook]
Look what I did I turned the dream into reality
They said I'm heading to the top that's where I rather
Be chasing paper nobody fast as me
I had to get it nothing came to me
I swear I always knew I was always gone be successful plus I can't wait to ice out my new Bezel
For real and all my Niggas eating time for extra
And you talking about hoes we got several
