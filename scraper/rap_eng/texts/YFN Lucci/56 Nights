[Intro]
Yeah, Yeah , Yeah(x9)

[Verse 1]
You know these bitches love me
I got the 40 on me we don't need security
I got about 40 on me tell my niggas don't worry
And if any problems you know all my niggas they bussin'
Let's pour out them bottles, let's pour out some lean
You know about me they know I'ma king
They know Summer Hill where I be
They know all my niggas be thugging
Man you know if he sweet we gone rob em
You know how it be we got problems we keep em revolvers
I go to the club with my niggas, we bought the bar on the store we some real ones
New Audemar shit cost the whole building
In a new foreign you see how I'm stirring
We came from nothing you see how we living
Been doing this shit since a lil one
All these chains not a lil one
I put that shit on my lil one
I put that shit on my bezel, I paid a 100 100 no lesser
I thought we told you lil niggas it's levels
I thought I'll told you lil niggas I'm better
I got codeine in my stomach tryna fuck this freak wit my buddy
Everyone eat we be grubbing made that bitch leave she won't fucking
I think all of my ice crazy, playing around with my ice you crazy
I spent 56 nights blazing
Every single night we was hell raising

We ain't tucking chains they gone have to take it
Fuck around and get deactivated

[Bridge]
I can still see the stars a nigga still faded yea

Whoever took my boy them niggas hated yea yea yea

[Verse 2]
I told my youngins load up all them k's
Gotta put a body on all them k's
Gotta catch a body each and everyday
You know my goons don't ever say a word but they kill yea they kill with my word
I need my pill my weed and my syrup
I heed me a bitch and a bitch that gone work
I need my stick cause I gotta stay alert
Free all my brothers some was selling dope
Some was scheming nigga that was us and now we chasing my dream fucking that money up
If you ain't gone squeeze then  don't hang with us
You better not move I'll fucking bust
I spent 56 nights waiting, yea I spent 56 nights
