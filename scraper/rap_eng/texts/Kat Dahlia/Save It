      [Verse 1: Kat Dahlia]
When you look my way, I don't know what to say
I
Want to make you stay
And I'm trying to convince myself, I'll never be
Deceived by you
Cause I'm making a decision and I'm working on this mission
For you
So I'm gonna drop it, yeah, I'm gonna risk it
Cause I see
Something, in your vision
Thats got me hoping, its got me willing
To risk
My loving, for the killing

[Hook: Kat Dahlia]
So if you wanna save it
For me, save it for me
Baby, If you wanna save it for me, save it for
Me
Ba-ba-baby, cause I'm working hard, to forget these scars

[Verse
2: Kat Dahlia]
When you look my way, you make me want to change
I hope you
Don't go in vein
And your eyes are telling me a story, that my heart wants to
Believe
And though I hesitate as I'm awake, in my dreams I'm falling so
Deep
But I won't dare, cause I'm still scared
Are you gonna save it for
Me? Cause I won't share
I throw my heart in the air
Baby don't lie to me
Do you swear

[Hook: Kat Dahlia]
If you gonna save it for me, save it
For me
Baby, If you gonna save it for me, save it for me
Ba-ba-baby, cause
I'm working hard, to forget these scars
I'm working hard, I know you might
Tear me apart
I'm working hard, you could tear me apart
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeaah, ya-yeah...

[Outro: Kat Dahlia]
When you look my way, when you
Look my way
When you look my way, when you look my way
Baby, stay
Ye-yeah, ye-yeah
When you look my way, I don't know what to say
You wanna
Make me stay
