[Intro]
Wee-ooh wee-ooh wee, woo woo woo
I hear them coming
Wee-ooh wee-ooh wee, woo woo woo
I hear them coming
Wee-ooh wee-ooh wee, woo woo woo
I hear them coming, I hear them coming
Wee-ooh wee-ooh wee, woo woo woo
Woo, woo, woo

[Verse 1]
There's magic inside of my cup
My eyes red just like firetruck
This room's starting to look down-side up
And outta mind, and I don't mind

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Phone blowing up, they wanna come through
It's cool if it's you and your crew
Them other hoes better find something else to do
That ain't the vibe, no not tonight

[Chorus]
It's going down like domino
When the smoke fill up the place, can't see in front of you
Tell the DJ run it back, loco
Yeah, the sirens that you're hearing ain't the 5-0
I'm that siren on the track

[Post-Chorus]
Wee-ooh wee-ooh wee, woo woo woo
I hear them coming
Wee-ooh wee-ooh wee, woo woo woo
I hear them coming
Wee-ooh wee-ooh wee, woo woo woo
I hear them coming, I hear them coming
Wee-ooh wee-ooh wee, woo woo woo
Woo, woo, woo

[Verse 2]
These bitches, they taking off they bra
My Snap gon' be so lit as fuck
We out here and we don't give up
We outta line and I don't mind

[Pre-Chorus 2]
We blowing up, they tryna come through
It's cool if it's you and your crew
Them other hoes better find something else to do
It's not the vibe, no not tonight

[Chorus]
It's going down like domino
When the smoke fill up the place, can't see in front of you
Tell the DJ run it back, loco
Yeah, the sirens that you're hearing ain't the 5-0
I'm that siren on the track

[Post-Chorus]
Wee-ooh wee-ooh wee, woo woo woo
I hear them coming
Wee-ooh wee-ooh wee, woo woo woo
I hear them coming
Wee-ooh wee-ooh wee, woo woo woo
I hear them coming, I hear them coming
Wee-ooh wee-ooh wee, woo woo woo
Woo, woo, woo

[Bridge]
Hour after hour, morning will come
We ain't even done yet
And we calling for more, more

[Chorus]
It's going down like domino
When the smoke fill up the place, can't see in front of you
Tell the DJ run it back, loco
Yeah, the sirens that you're hearing ain't the 5-0
I'm that siren on the track

[Post-Chorus]
Wee-ooh wee-ooh wee, woo woo woo
I hear, I feel them coming
Wee-ooh wee-ooh wee, woo woo woo
I hear them coming, coming
Wee-ooh wee-ooh wee, woo woo woo
I hear them coming, I hear them coming
Wee-ooh wee-ooh wee, woo woo woo
Woo, woo, woo
