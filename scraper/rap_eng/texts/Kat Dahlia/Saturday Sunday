[Chorus]
Is it Saturday, Sunday, Saturday, Sunday?
Poppin' shots down the same lips that I pray
Saturday, Sunday, Saturday, Sunday
Maybe I'll get it right one day

[Verse 1]
Got my makeup on my face, who am I today?
Is today a new day?
Am I in a maze?
With my knees to the ground, head facing down to pray
While I'm a thousand miles away
No time or space

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh preacher, you're way too loud
My head's spinning 'round
Wash my gown
It's drenched in black, don't let me drown
Oh preacher, it's way too soon
Is it Saturday night or Sunday afternoon?
Who do I tell my stories to?
Is the DJ in the confession room?

[Chorus]
Is it Saturday, Sunday, Saturday, Sunday?
Poppin' shots down the same lips that I pray
Saturday, Sunday, Saturday, Sunday
Maybe I'll get it right one day

[Verse 2]
Bodies all around, hypnotised by the sound that surrounds
Don't count me out, has the savior been found?
Spirits in my system, trying to resist 'em, no
They will not go, pour the wine slow

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh preacher, you're way too loud
My head's spinning 'round
Wash my gown
It's drenched in black, don't let me drown
Oh preacher, it's way too soon
Is it Saturday night or Sunday afternoon?
Who do I tell my stories to?
Is the DJ in the confession room?

[Bridge]
Say nothing I've been accused of my own use
I'm going, going, so it can cure my abuse
Say nothing I'll hold us in for my own use
I'm going, going, so it can cure my abuse, abuse

[Chorus]
Is it Saturday, Sunday, Saturday, Sunday?
Poppin' shots down the same lips that I pray
Saturday, Sunday, Saturday, Sunday
Maybe I'll get it right one day

[Outro]
Take my sorrow, sorrow away from me
Oh it's dark baby
Turn up the lights, turn up the lights
Oh it's dark baby
DJ turn up the lights, turn up the lights
I'm falling, falling, falling in my abuse
I'm falling, falling, falling, again, angel, angel
My feet hurt
I won't make it to the water
Oh preacher
