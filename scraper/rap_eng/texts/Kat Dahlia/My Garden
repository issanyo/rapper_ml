[Pre-Chorus]
Woah!
Woah!
Sing, sing
Yeah you got a lot of bitches and they got a lot of wishes
They be feenin' for the riches, now you gotta give 'em more

[Chorus]
My garden's wide of daisies
And it's untouched, come play
Check here, my rhythm baby
My sky's been looking grey
My garden's wide of daisies
And it's untouched of sin
My root's been craving lately
To soak in your diamonds
Take it, you want it
And I want you laying on me
My flower beds calling your name

[Bridge]
I'll let your rain fall down if it sparkles like diamonds
Just let me wear the crown, my garden's appetizing
I'll let your rain fall down if it sparkles like diamonds
Just let me wear the crown, my garden's appetizing

[Pre-Chorus]
Woah!
Woah!
Sing, sing
Yeah you got a lot of bitches and they got a lot of wishes
They be feenin' for the riches, now you gotta give 'em more
Woah!
Woah!
Sing, sing
Yeah you got a lot of bitches and they got a lot of wishes
They be feenin' for the riches, now you gotta give 'em more

[Chorus]
My garden's wide of daisies
And it's untouched, come play
Check here, my rhythm baby
My sky's been looking grey
My garden's wide of daisies
And it's untouched of sin
My root's been craving lately
To soak in your diamonds
Take it, you want it
And I want you laying on me
My flower beds calling your name

[Bridge]
I'll let your rain fall down if it sparkles like diamonds
Just let me wear the crown, my garden's appetizing

[Pre-Chorus]
Woah!
Woah!
Sing, sing
Yeah you got a lot of bitches and they got a lot of wishes
They be feenin' for the riches, now you gotta give 'em more
I'm singing woah!
I'm singing woah! Yeah
Yeah you got a lot of bitches and they got a lot of wishes
They be feenin' for the riches, now you gotta give 'em more

[Outro]
I'm singing woah, woah, woah, woah, yeah
Take it, you want it
And I want you laying on it
I'll have you
I'll have you screaming my name
