[Hook: Kat Dahlia]
You say you a gangsta, that don’t impress me none
You say you a gangsta, ain’t seen a thing you've done
I do it all on myself, I ain’t getting help
From no one, from no one
You say you a gangsta, that don’t impress me none
You say you a gangsta, ain’t seen a thing you've done
I do it all on myself, I ain’t getting help
From no one, from no one

[Verse 1: Marqui]
Say you gangsta
Why cause you been on the block
You think it's gangsta 'cause you always steady showing your Glock
Nah nigga
See, that ain't gangsta
You claim you getting money
But you holding fake chains up
You don't got no goals
I don't understand you
You hype you fucked a bitch the whole neighborhood ran through
Said your life ain't gon' work out
Since you was twelve
The only you get a workout
If you running from twelve
Then your homie got booked
Like he was up on a shelf
And when you found out what happened all you said was 'oh well'
When a real gangsta find out his homie in jail
He might bust a couple traps just to come up on the bail
I hear him screaming out for help he can yell and he can shout
Every hustle in the hood is so that they can get up out
You dropped out of school but you finna learn today
You can't do the things you do and look at me and still say

[Hook: Kat Dahlia]
You say you a gangsta, that don’t impress me none
You say you a gangsta, ain’t seen a thing you've done
I do it all on myself, I ain’t getting help
From no one, from no one
You say you a gangsta, that don’t impress me none
You say you a gangsta, ain’t seen a thing you've done
I do it all on myself, I ain’t getting help
From no one, from no one

[Verse 2: Marqui]
Say you gangsta
How that don't make no sense
You don't got no job you don't pay no rent
But see you big and you bad right
You as bright as flashlight
Well how come you was acting like a dumb-ass last night
Reppin' a block that you ain't from nigga
Living on off a couple dollars fucking bum nigga
I seen you lose please don't tell me that you won nigga
Karma finna catch up to you better run nigga
And you be mad cause these cops always trynna make a move
The real reason why the block is hot my nigga cause of you
You'd prolly pull a gun in a fight you'd get in
Would ya momma be proud of this life that you living
I doubt that she even knows what you doing half of the time
Daddy wasn't in ya life? get in the back of the line
We just had to man up and pray that it wouldn't change us
And we took care of our families now that's gangsta
