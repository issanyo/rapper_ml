[Verse 1]
You tell me the timing can't be wrong
Cause when you kiss me, clocks they stop cause they just don't belong
We know what we're doing, to each other, under covers, undercover lover
Yeah the road is rocky, but that will never stop me
I will always love you
And when we're not together, I won't have to remember
Cause I will always love you

[Chorus]
I'm an addict, addict, addict
I'm addicted to you
I'm an addict, addict, addict
I'm addicted to you
But the odds is stacked against us, ain't nothing can break us
I'm an addict, addict, addict
I'm addicted to you
I'm addicted to you
You, you, you, you, you
I'm addicted to you
You, you, you, you, you

[Verse 2]
I tell you it's easier said than done
And then you look at me with that face
And I think there's nothing we can't overcome
With each other, under covers, strung out on my lover
And I don't want to recover
Yeah it's complicated, but I still think we'll make it
Cause I will always love you
This light ain't never dying, as long as we keep trying
They don't hold a candle to you

[Chorus] I'm an addict, addict, addict
I'm addicted to you
I'm an addict, addict, addict
I'm addicted to you
But the odds is stacked against us, ain't nothing can break us
I'm an addict, addict, addict
I'm addicted to you
I'm addicted to you
You, you, you, you, you
I'm addicted to you
You, you, you, you, you

[Verse]
I think it's safe to say i'm ot ashamed that everytime you walk away it draws insane, I'm addicted to the flame
[?]

[Chorus] I'm an addict, addict, addict
I'm addicted to you
I'm an addict, addict, addict
I'm addicted to you
But the odds is stacked against us, ain't nothing can break us
I'm an addict, addict, addict
I'm addicted to you
I'm addicted to you
You, you, you, you, you
I'm addicted to you
You, you, you, you, you
