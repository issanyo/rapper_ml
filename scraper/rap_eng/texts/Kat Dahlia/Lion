[Verse 1]
Harvard University, sticker on a Honda
And you got, like, two degrees, still living with your mama
Going by the rule book, it don't get you any farther
And they talking down at you as if they is your father

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, not I, I live just how I like
Oh yeah, they try to leave you high and dry
I'm tattooed, on fire as if it's summertime
Oh yeah, they try, but I'm sticking to my pride

[Chorus]
Like a lion, a lion
I can smell the blood a mile away
They lying, they lying
I bet that you won't say it to my face

[Verse 2]
Abuela used to move that work just like Tony Montana
5 years old in Dolce now, I'm bitter about designers
And papi fell in love with the coco
He tryna fit Chanel up his nostrils
Yeah, they tell me oh no, Yoko, oh no
Yes we can, Obama
In trouble with the popo, guess it's like father, like daughter
And since I am millennial, I do just what I wanna
Oh bitch, I'm Al Pacino, go alpaca with the llama

[Chorus]
Like a lion, a lion
I can smell the blood a mile away
They lying, they lying
I bet that you won't say it to my face

[Post-Chorus]
Lion in my den, I'm sitting in my throne
Smell the blood from miles away
I'm a lion in my den, I'm sitting in my throne
Smell the blood from miles away

[Verse 3]
Mama went from Cuba to a cubicle
But I don't like to square dance
Root of evil is the multiple of my animal
Add it on my plate, I am a carnivore
Minus all the bull, divide and conquer like Conquistador
I'm feeling like a feline saying, "What it do, mayne?"
Clauses in my contract, let that sink into your brain
Fly me to Savannah, Georgia, hopping off the planes
Goddamn, it feels so good to be top of the food chain

[Chorus]
Like a lion, a lion
I can smell the blood a mile away
They lying, they lying
I bet that you won't say it to my face

[Post-Chorus]
Lion in my den, I'm sitting in my throne
Smell the blood from miles away
I'm a lion in my den, I'm sitting in my throne
Smell the blood from miles away
Like a lion, a lion
