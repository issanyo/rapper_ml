[Verse 1]
Time's been ticking, hearts are runnin', think that Cupid's up to somethin'
You asked me how I feel, I say nothin'
But lately color seems so bright and the stars light up the night
My feet they feel so light I'm ignoring all the signs
I keep on frontin', yeah, I stay bluffin'
I keep you wonderin', keep you huntin' for my lovin'
But I crave us huggin',  yeah, I stay stubborn
Cause I can't admit that you got all the strings and know just how to tug 'em

[Chorus]
I think I'm in love again
(My head, yeah, you're in my head)
I think I'm in love again
(My head, yeah, you're in my head)
I didn't think it could be true
Let alone that it would be you
I think I'm in love again
(I'm in love, I'm in love, I'm in love)

[Verse 2]
My hearts' pacin', I'm confused, I'm dazin'
I saw something I never seen in you, it's got me shakin'
I must be hallucinatin', I hear it happens
I'm just sayin', babe, I'm just sayin'
Someone give me some paper, someone give me some crayons
I'm feeling like a child, I need something to play on
I'm trying hard to trust you when you say "give me a hand"
Baby, I'm fallin', I hope you catch me when I land

[Chorus]
I think I'm in love again
(My head, yeah, you're in my head)
I think I'm in love again
(My head, yeah, you're in my head)
I didn't think it could be true
Let alone that it would be you
I think I'm in love again
(I'm in love, I'm in love, I'm in love)

[Bridge]
In my dreams you're the dutch and I'm the duchess
And your blunts are always loose, so I'm in charge of rollin' dutches
And we getting so high, we always get the munchies
And we go for early brunches that turn into late lunches
And we ain't gotta label, we're just rollin' with the punches
I make fun of your belly and tell you do some crunches
And you say "yeah, well your ass jiggles, go and do some lunges"
I say "fuck you" while I'm thinking of you as my husband
I think I'm in love

[Chorus]
I think I'm in love again
(My head, yeah, you're in my head)
I think I'm in love again
(My head, yeah, you're in my head)
I didn't think it could be true
Let alone that it would be you
I think I'm in love again
(I'm in love, I'm in love, I'm in love)
I think I'm in love again
