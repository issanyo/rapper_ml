[Intro]
“Does everyone need an audition to get with you?”
“You ain’t gotta go through all that shit”
“Then I choose you”

One two
When I step in the room
I bring the dynamite, tic-tic kaboom
Vaporizer
Turn up the tune
Ima float you up
Then Ima pop that balloon

Raise your lighters
Turn my mic up
Tear the nights up
Make your move
I'm the savior
I got the flavor
My shit's major
It's what I do

We be popping in the grassy yard
Breathe it in and baby blow it
If you're happy and you know it
2 a.m and we ain't even start
The tree's got money on it
If you're happy, baby, blow it

If you're happy and you know it
Raise your hands
Bring it to your lips and breathe it in
If you're happy and you know it
Raise your hands
Bring it to your lips and breathe it in

One, two
You know the sounds so new
I got that cheese
I'm so fondu
Shake your culo, baby
Show that tattoo
If he shouting he a baller tell him woopty fucking doo

Raise your lighters
Turn my mic up
Tear the nights up
Make your move
I'm the savior
I got the flavor
My shit's major
It's what I do

We be popping in the grassy yard
Breathe it and baby blow it
If you're happy and you know it
2 a.m and we ain't even start
The tree's got money on it
If you're happy, baby, blow it

If you're happy and you know it
Raise your hands
Bring it to your lips and breathe it in
If you're happy and you know it
Raise your hands
Bring it to your lips and breathe it in
If you're happy and you know it
Raise your hands
Bring it to your lips and breathe it in
If you're happy and you know it
Raise your hands
Bring it to your lips and breathe it in

Raise your lighters
Raise your lighters
Tear the nights up
I’ma start the fire
Raise your lighters
Tear the nights up
Turn my mic up
I'ma start the fire
Raise your lighters
Raise your lighters
Tear the nights up
I'ma start the fire
Raise your lighters
Tear the nights up
Turn my mic up
I'ma start my fire

If you're happy and you know it raise your hands
Bring it to your lips and breathe it in
If you're happy and you know it raise your hands
Bring it to your lips and breathe it in
If you're happy and you know it raise your hands
Bring it to your lips and breathe it in
If you're happy and you know it raise your hands
Bring it to your lips and breathe it in
