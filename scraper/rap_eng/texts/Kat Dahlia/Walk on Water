[Verse 1]
You shut your light, you left me blind
But I could never turn away
Whether you're black, whether you're white
You always left me in the gray
And my shadow's cruel, but I never knew
Now I'm tasting blue, while you're changing que
You bring the rain, you bring the night
I never get that time of day
I wanna cry, you wanna fight
All this lovin' causing pain
Wish you wore my shoes, cause I've torn them through
Though I wore that proof, I'm so confused
I'm not dealing too well, cause I just can't tell
If I'm entering the grace of, heaven or hell
And I trust you, cause I just can't tell
I know you so well
Remember when we fell
Remember when we fell

[Chorus 1]
I'm attracted to the ocean, just because I feel it
Can I walk upon the water?
If I'm attracted to the ocean, just because I feel it
Can I walk upon the water?
And I'm drowning in emotion, your quick sand suffocating
I wish I was a little taller
If I'm attracted to the ocean, just because I feel it
Can I walk upon the water?

[Verse 1] + [Chorus 1]
You shut your light, you left me blind
But I could never turn away
Whether you're black, whether you're white
You always left me in the gray
And you shadow's cruel, but I never knew
Now I'm tasting blue, while you're changing que
You bring the rain, you bring the night
I never get that time of day
I wanna cry, you wanna fight
All this lovin' causing pain
Wish you wore my shoes, cause I've torn them through
Wish you wore my shoes, cause I've torn them through
I'm not dealing too well, cause I just can't tell
If I'm entering the grace of, heaven or hell
Can I trust you, cause I just can't tell
I know you so well
Remember when we fell
Remember when we fell
I'm attracted to the ocean, just because I feel it
Can I walk upon the water?
If I'm attracted to the ocean, just because I feel it
Can I walk upon the water?
And I'm drowning in emotion, your quick sand suffocating
I wish I was a little taller
If I'm attracted to the ocean, just because I feel it
Can I walk upon the water
[Bridge]
It's a storm brewing, on the horizon
No matter what I'm choosing, baby I ain't decidin'
Is suicide, suicide
Like you told me catch a knife
I trade your promise for my life

[Chorus 2]
I'm attracted to the ocean, but just because I feel it
I can't walk upon the water
Babe I'm attracted to the ocean, but just because I feel it
I can't walk upon the water
And now I'm drowning in emotion, your quick sand suffocating
Wish I was a little taller
I'm attracted to the ocean, but just because I feel it
I can't walk upon the water

[Outro]
I can't walk upon the water no
I'm attracted to the ocean
But I slip right through, I slip right through
I drown for you
Babe I slip right through, I slip right through
I drown for you
I drown for you
