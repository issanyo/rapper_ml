You say you a gangsta, that don't impress me none
You say you a gangsta, ain't seen a thing you done
I do it all on myself, I ain't getting help
From no one, from no one

(Insanity)
I'm not a gangster but shoot with my rezoezoe bang bang
I'm not a gangster but Insanity a bit koekoe yeah yeah
I'm not a gangster but chew you up like a hamster
Then spit you out I'm a rapper
And I multiply like a group a gang bang
So get set set back white trash but no redneck bang bang
Frag in my backpack with some lead lose your head bang bang
The do is mine explode online now hashtag bang bang
I said the do is mine explode online now hashtag bang bang
I know what I can and I know what I can't but the do that I spend
Is more than I have you don't know where it went when the moment is there
And the moment is there
Got a hole in my hand no one is holding me back getting do and a pen
That is all that I have
And all that I need to proceed on the street with a beat
I defeat all these ho's with a rap so bang
Bang bang I'm a little bit insane
But it's ok cuz he it's nothing but a game
Right I don't spit on the same mic twice
Cuz they died I'm sick you're nothing like me
Now I see why you don't like me were no gangster

(Hook - Kat Dahlia)
You say you a gangsta, that don't impress me none
You say you a gangsta, ain't seen a thing you done
I do it all on myself, I ain't getting help
From no one, from no one

I ainâ€™t getting help, w - won't ask for it
Cuz once it's said and done
I'll be the one who's dancing with the devil
Put the pencil on the gravel when the paper's filled
A rebel on an instrumental, w - won't take it chill
Gotta go, got a lotta flows, DL's staying real
With the art we know, the love we know, shit, made me feel
Not sorry though. Keep rolling and we will take the wheel
And if it ain't about money, boy it ain't a deal
So bang. bang bang. Take fake boys out my sight
Still paid all of the price, I became one with the mic
And I'll stay on it for life. I got faith in all of my rhymes
Now let me build the empire, got a state up in my mind
And if The Lord gets my soul, the devil will be jealous
So I need to find the balance. We define the presence
Leave the time, be alive and see the right perspective
Will we die in heaven? God, free my life from questions!

From no one, from no one
