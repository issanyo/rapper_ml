So if you wanna save it for me, save it for me
Baby, If you wanna save it for me, save it for me
Ba-ba-baby, cause I'm working hard, to forget these scars

(Jake Mackson)
I still try to forget
But all of y'all still remind me
Of the rope wrapped on my neck
And the hope I transferred in envy
Need to get this shit of my lap
It's time to get my mind clear
But I will rhyme for a check
Like I’m living a nightmare
But I can't sleep
And it’s, still hard to forget, but even harder to remember
That everything I had, was way more than I asked for…
But now everything I have, is way less than what I prayed for
I aim for the stars. And I will find my directions
I'll be my guide with this rap shit
Already survived my actions
I had to decide - to left it behind
This level defines my passion
I never realized, that I had it in mind
To express my life with rapping
So I’m asking: Is heaven’s there when I end it?
I can't stand it. It’s so easy to get the throne if it's handed to ye
Looking down - feeling worse. God, Hallelujah
Let's forget, what we did, make the best of the future
And if ye didn’t know us yet, let me introduce ye

So if you wanna save it for me, save it for me
Baby, If you wanna save it for me, save it for me

(Insanity)
Look at me now got the feeling that I made it already
I see the crowd this is out of the ordinary
Another round DL I look at my homie
And tell him I'm proud people better be fucking ready
Cuz sky is the limit I feel like a cloud
Life is a circle I'm spinning around
It's about looking up and just getting it down
I'm on top of the world homie give me the crown
Get all the pain put it deep in the ground
Only get one shot not quitting this round
Homie never give up shout it till it rebounds
It's never enough homie I can see now
I was blinded before and I feel alive I was dying before
Now this is my life just a mic and a source
Give it all I don't wanna live my life with remorse
Doors open I'm striking with force
Wars chosen I die in remorse
It pours broken it might be the cause
Of course it is, but I can't admit
The reason why I am this sick
I slipped and felt but still handled it
Rolled the dice I just gambled it
Then made my words like I scrambled it
Back and forward but I expanded
Just take a look what the damage did
Know that I made mistakes but I'm glad I did
Cuz it made me the man that I am damn it

(Hook - Kat Dahlia)
So if you wanna save it for me, save it for me
Baby, If you wanna save it for me, save it for me
Ba-ba-baby, cause I'm working hard, to forget these scars
