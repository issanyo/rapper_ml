[Verse 1]
Cause' you're always on my mind
All the memories of your lies
And even though you did some crimes
I thought your love meant to be kind

And we both made such a mess
And we both caused so much stress
I never thought you'd let it get
To the point of our regrets

[Pre Hook]
And now my feet just move as they think of you
My soles are wearing thin, on my shoes

Now I can't walk around the city
Cause this block is full of memories
Of us acting so damn silly
I can't stop walkin' round this city

[Hook]
Help Me
My heart is feeling weak
I'm roaming every corner where we used to meet
Stop me
Can't even feel my feet
They keep on dragging me through every broken street
[Verse 2]
And the love was like gold
But the bugs always crept into
Your lungs you were sold

Every time you would blow
Out the smoke, from your lips I would kiss
With my heart and my soul

[Pre hook]
And now my feet just move as they think of you
My soles are wearing thin on my shoes

Now i can't walk around the city
Cause this block is full of memories
Of us actin so damn silly
I can't stop walkin' round this city

[Hook]


I need save, me, me
Cause when he wants it, he wants it
Its all that he, needs, needs
And the moment hes got it he finally feels
Free, free
And the moment hes got it hes free
And I cry myself to sleep

[Pre hook]
And now my feet just move as they think of you
My soles are wearing thin on my shoes

Now I can't walk around this city
Cause this block is full of memories
Of us acting so damn silly

I can't walk around this city
I can't walk around this city

Help me
My heart is feeling weak
I'm roaming every corner where we used to meet
