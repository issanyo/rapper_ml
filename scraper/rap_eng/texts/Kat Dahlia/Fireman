[Intro]

[Verse 1: Kat Dahlia]
He taking one step forward one step back
And it's all a part of his attack
He taking one step forward one step back
Cause he knows I like that

Fireman, oh fireman
Somebody turn up the fan
Oh, I better watch my hands

But I can't stop looking at his body
Baby he is hotter than wasabi
Oh how he seduces with his flame
And his eyes are looking mighty naughty
I know we both know he’s got it
Baby I don’t even know his name

[Hook]
Fireman, oh fireman
Are the flames too hot for you to stand?

[Verse 2: Kat Dahlia]
I'm taking one step forward one step back
Yeah he's got me dancing on this track
And he is showing off the heat he packs
And it's racks on racks on racks on racks

Yeah fireman,oh fireman

Oh baby hes got a plan
Oh I try to run but I can't
And his lighting looks so bright
I've lost my sight of right
And I'm trying with my might to hold back
But he's got me chokin' while I sip
Hes got me smoking like a match
And the combination of the two goes against all the facts

[Hook]
And it's fireman, oh fireman
Are the flames to high for you to stand

[Verse 3: Kat Dahlia]
He's blowing flames out through his gats
And now I'm taking bout ten steps back
But I'm tripping on that free crack
All the lights go out it fades to black
Fireman, oh fireman

Oh baby he had a plan
Oh I can't see where I stand

He's a deciever
But He'll make you a believer
Til he has your ashes in his hand
He likes the smell of flesh burning
He don't deal with no bleeders
Watch him light his match
Watch his smile turn
He don't get what he want then watch him get a little meaner
His fists get stiff and his eyes get stern

He claims he's got the medicine, now babies got the fever
And he'll be there to watch me burn
Burnnnnn Burnnn Burnnnn

[Outro]
Fireman, Oh Fireman
Oh baby he's got a plan
Oh I tried to run but I can't

Fireman, Oh Fireman
Baby he's got a plan
Oh I tried to run but I can't Oh I can't
My Fireman
