[Intro: Kat Dahlia]
War war war war war war warning fear one (3x)

[Hook: Kat Dahlia]
Warning warning when he die no one notice
When we die they make sculptures
Warning pick a side you're supposed to
In these streets ain't no surviving the vultures

[Verse 1: Fat Joe]
So much coke you young boys won't believe it
Hopping off J E T S I'm Revis
Island stylin minks to the floor
(Remy Ma: To the floor? nigga what you need a stylist for?)
Before the red carpets I was into narcotics
Beat bad bitches rats and all charges
Black Gucci flip flops steppin off teak
Gotta get from round you niggas you all leech
Robbin guess it's just my lifestyle
I know I'm wrong but the Rollie got the right dial
I mean I gotta be the greatest shot the G O D
You can't believe how many fiends my eyes seen OD
My West coast shorty throw DUB with four fingers
Ma you a pleasant surprise like Porzingis
Been just wave one button like a vato
My niggas used to run through the tunnel like El Chapo

[Hook: Kat Dahlia]
Warning warning when he die no one notice
When we die they make sculptures
Warning pick a side you're supposed to
In these streets ain't no surviving the vultures (2x)

[Verse 2: Remy Ma]
How dare you allow people to compare you
Better be careful cause I don't care you
Tried to be my friend but I didn't care to
Bob and weave ya'll hoes like hairdos
I'm from the Boogie man why would I fear you
When you scared to death and your flunkies is scared too
Felt your heart trembling when I came near you
Beatin outta your chest I thought it would tear through
What's your war plan they should of prepared you
I'm ready to ride on bitches already in gear 2
They said for me to blow that I had to air you
Could of ended your career but I spared you
Seen you a frenemy I had a clear view
Now they behind me them hoes in my rear-view
Yeah they fallin on deaf ears they can't hear you
I'm shittin on bitches where the fuck is the bathroom

[Hook: Kat Dahlia]
Warning warning when he die no one notice
When we die they make sculptures
Warning pick a side you're supposed to
In these streets ain't no surviving the vultures (2x)

[Outro: Kat Dahlia]
