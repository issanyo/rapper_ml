[Verse 1]
I say it's just a fling
Don't go celebrating
He wants to make me better
He want to make me wetter
Baby it's just a fling
He wants to make me scream
He wants to make me do
Those things that I could never do
No I can't stick with you
Baby it's just a fling

[Chorus]
I climbed the mountain top
I conquered your hard rock
Your lava never stops
My lava never stops
I climbed the mountain top
I conquered your hard rock
Your lava never stops
My lava never stops

[Verse 2]
Oh here we go again
Remember baby, we're just friends
I'm falling off the bed and
You show me how to get up
Oh baby we're just friends
You show me now you're in
You show me how to drink you up like gin
Oh now I've made a mess
And I can't find my dress
Oh baby we're just friends

[Chorus]

[Verse 1]
