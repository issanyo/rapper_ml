[Verse 1]

Ok, here comes the dealer
And hes got all the power
Don't think that luck'll lead ya
Sure fish you'll get devoured
You don't know what you're in for
Its how you play how you score
Stop lookin' down at the floor
Don't hesitate go get yours

[Hook]

Oh Keep your hand to your heart
Oh Why you playin with sharks?

Play the king and blame the joker
Dont let them know your bluff
Dont let them call your bluff
This is called the game of life
Its a risk its a sacrifice
Dont you dare to think twice
Theyll cut you cold, like ice
Oh this is called the game of life

[Verse 2]

Here comes your luck suited up
But dont rely on it too much
Flop 1, 2 ,3 royal flush
Dont drown watch for that river
Forgiveness dont exist,look
Read faces like you read books
Dont get caught up on their hook
They fishin, ready to cook

[Hook]

Oh Keep your hand to your heart
Oh Why you playin with sharks?

Play the king and blame the joker
Dont let them know your bluff
Dont let them call your bluff
This is called the game of life
Its a risk its a sacrifice
Dont you dare to think twice
Theyll cut you cold, like ice
Oh this is called the game of life

[Bridgex2]

Time to bet
Final round
Are you in?
Are you out?
All chips in
All hands down
Rivers high, will you drown?

[Hook]

That rivers high, will you drown?
Ok, here comes the dealer
