Is it crazy that I want you to stay when I tell you to leave, when I tell you go
Is it crazy that I say your name all times of day then I say my own
Tell me baby is it crazy
Tell me baby is it crazy
Is it crazy when you're gone for a minute
I'm missing you yea I feel alone
Is it crazy that I'm jealous of them bitches
When they get yo time and I know it's wrong
Tell me is it crazy
Yea, I need to know if it's crazy, damn
'Cause I ain't been myself
Lately something's going on
Now, boy I ain't even slept
I've been up all night long
In my head
Tryna figure out what I want
What I do, what I don't
Is it crazy all that I miss is you
Tell me 'cause it's blowing my mind
Tell me 'cause I don't understand
How someone just can walk into your life
And everything before that you forget
Is it crazy
Tell me what's going on, I need to know
'Cause I ain't tryna lose myself or lose control
Baby tell me the truth, I need to know
Is it crazy
Baby, is it crazy
Is it crazy that I told my ex 'don't call no more 'cause I'm in love'
Is it crazy that I keep your shirt right here just to smell your cologne
Damn it sounds crazy
Tell me is it crazy
'Cause I ain't been myself
Lately something's going on
Now, boy I ain't even slept
I've been up all night long
In my head
Tryna figure out what I want
What I do, what I don't
Is it crazy all that I miss is you
Tell me 'cause it's blowing my mind
Tell me 'cause I don't understand
How someone just can walk into your life
And everything before that you forget
Is it crazy, is it crazy
Crazy! Is it crazy
Crazy! Is it crazy
Tell me is it crazy
Is it crazy, is it crazy
Well if it is I'll just be crazy for you
Baby 'cause it's blowing my mind
Tell me 'cause I don't understand
How someone just can walk into your life
And everything before that you forget
I'm crazy crazy crazy for you
I'm crazy crazy crazy for you, oh oh oh
