[Verse 1]
What a strange thought
I'm running round town
I'm tryna find my heart, but it's been shut
By the one who holds the gun

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Oh he got me
He shot me good
Oh he got me
He shot me good

[Chorus]
You, you treat me like a fool
You're making me feel used by you
Oh what to I do to break loose
Oh I'm so confused
I guess I'm payin' my dues
Why do I like this abuse by you?
Oh what do i do to break loose
You're just another dude

[Verse 2]
I used to stand so tall
Now I can't stand at all
Babe he made me fall
He shot me on the wall

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Oh he got me
He shot me good
Oh he got me
Oh he had the gun, he had the pain
I was the mark

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Oh baby you've got me runnin, runnin, runnin, runnin, all over town
I've got nothin, nothin, nothin, nothin to show but these wounds
Are proof, it's all cause of you, cause of you
Oh baby you've got me runnin, runnin, runnin, runnin, all over town
I've got nothin, nothin, nothin, nothin to show but these wounds
Are proof, it's all cause of you, cause of you
You're just another dude
