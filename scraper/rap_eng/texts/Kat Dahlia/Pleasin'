Lock up, lights out
He's in my house
Lock up, lights out
He's in my house
Lock up, lights out
He turns me out
Lock up, lights out
He's in my house

It's a quiet house
He's climbing up the stairs
While I'm combing out my hair
He blew the fire out
And then he turned my chair
And started kissing me down there
I got the weight up on my shoulders
But baby I can't take it any longer
I want you to make me weak at my knees
You can be the boss, my nemesis

He takes my body for pleasin'
He do what he please
And I like it, baby

He use my body for pleasin'
He do what he please
And I like it, baby

He lets me paint his mouth
He likes my body bare
Rips away every layer
He likes keeping count
How many times we shout
Says: "'Cause baby, it's only fair"
Mama said that easy days are gone
She told me: "Be a soldier, be the strongest one"
But right now I need a captain to call all the shots
Take all of the control that I think I've got

He use my body for pleasin'
He do what he please
And I like it, baby

He use my body for pleasin'
He do what he please
And I like it, baby

He use my body for pleasin'
He do what he please
And I like it, baby

He use my body for pleasin'
He do what he please
And I like it
I like it, baby

I like it, baby
I like it, baby
I like it, baby

Lock up, lights out
He's in my house
Lock up, lights out
He's in my house
Lock up, lights out
He turns me out
So, lights up, lights up, lights up, lights up

He use my body for pleasin'
He do what he please
And I like it, baby

He use my body for pleasin'
He do what he please
And I like it, baby (I like it, baby)

Lock up, lights out
He's in my house
Lock up, lights out
He's in my house
Lock up, lights out
He turns me out
Lock up, lights out
He's in my house
