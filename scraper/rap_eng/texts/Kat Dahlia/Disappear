[Verse 1]
It's like a dream
It calling me, baby
Now are days, if anything
You calling me, everything but baby
You uuhuhu

So, uuhuhu
Even when you act this way I say

[Chorus]
Don't leave me here
I need you near
Something 'bout do way you talking
It's like we out of opcions

Don't disappear
I'm holding my tears
Backing forth we so exhausted
Don't tell me we lost it

[Pos-Chorus]
Don't disappear
Don't disappear
I need you here
I need you here
Right here

[Verse 2]
You used to be a many things
It's crazy
We couldn't seen
This coming, the way you looking it pass
You got me crazy
Uuhuhu

So, uuhuhu
Even when you act this way I say

[Chorus]
Don't leave me here
I need you near
Something 'bout do way you talking
It's like we out of opcions

Don't disappear
I'm holding my tears
Backing forth we so exhausted
Don't tell me we lost it

[Pos-Chorus]
Don't disappear
Don't disappear
I need you here
I need you here
Right here

Don't disappear
Don't disappear
I need you here
I need you here
