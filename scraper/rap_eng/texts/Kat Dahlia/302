[Verse 1]
Me, and my thoughts
I'm plottin' out the ways to tie his heart in knots
Its love, on the rocks
I put him on my pedestal and then I let him drop

[Pre-hook]
Im a pretty flower, but I sting him like hell
Im playin' with his mind, I can't help myself
Enchant him with a dance and put him under my spell
And I know that I'm no good for his mental health

[Hook]
Im 302in' my baby
Hes sick and I'm his disease
I'm crazy
He always sayin' he'll leave me
But he don't wanna be free
He's crazy

[Verse 2]
Like it or not
I'm the mastermind, I control your heart
And you can't connect the dots
So you live with the disease, til' your body rots!

[Pre-hook]
I'm a pretty flower, but I sting him like hell
I'm playin' with his mind, I can't help myself
Enchant him with a dance and put him under my spell
And I know that I'm no good for his mental health

[Hook]
I'm 302in' my baby
Hes sick and I'm his disease
I'm crazy
He always sayin' he'll leave me
But he don't wanna be free
He's crazy

[Bridge]
You're falling in so deep, baby you can't see
Since You're falling to your knees, ask to marry me
Falling in so deep, baby you can't see
You're falling, you're falling, to your knees

[Pre-hook]
I'm a pretty flower, but I sting him like hell
I'm playin' with his mind, I can't help myself
Enchant him with a dance and put him under my spell
And I know that I'm no good for his mental health

[Hook]
I'm 302in' my baby
Hes sick and I'm his disease
I'm crazy
He always sayin' he'll leave me
But he don't wanna be free
He's crazy
