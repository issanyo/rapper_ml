[Verse 1]

I've gotta go, I've gotta run, I'm on my way
You tryna' stop me, now you got a thousand things to say
Well you got 5 minutes babe, I've gotta catch my train
And now you're on one knee, you pray, you pray that imma' wait

[Hook]

It's too late, I won't stay
It's always wam-bam, then a thank you ma'am
It ain't long till' you're back on your phone again

[Hook][x2]

I got another man, he loves to hold my hand
No he don't play no games, he don't play no pretend
He always puts me on my pedestal, that's where I stand
You look at me like i'm a vegetable, just cold and bland

[Verse 2]

Hes oh so warm, hes like the sun, and everyday
Ain't' even got ask just to know if he misses me
I say how you gonna show me love for eternity?
He says baby where there's a will, there's a way

[Hook 2]

It's too late, I won't stay
It's always wam-bam, then a thank you ma'am
Then you're back to your bad habits again!

[Hook][x2]

[Bridge]

He loves to kiss and tell me how I do it so well
Now you're ringing my bell you got your dreams up for sale
Oh baby, well I ain't' buying, Im tired of tryin'
Tryin' is tiring Under you's, not where I stand

[Hook][x2][End]
