[Intro: Kat Dahlia]
So you a gangsta, that don't impress me none
You say you a gangsta, ain't seen a thing you done
I do it all on myself,  I ain't getting help
From no one, from no one

[Verse 1: DaykoN]
Everybody got a problem with me cause i'm beast
And i'm white that's right, I'm here on this track to
Prove you don't need to be black
And that your ideas are whack, Here i stand
With this strand, this life in my hands
I was born to achieve with my own technique
But homies think i deceive too some kind of degree
But i cruise with the bruise of my own choices
Every kid that I know is feeling voiceless
Don't you think I see, what you tryna be
I believe that you better leave, 'fore I cleave
You live in some preconceived idea
Of what a gangsta' should be
Is this a dream, i'm livin' supreme, hatching a scheme
But I can't move cause the water flows upstream
And so, can't reach, it makes me wanna scream
Cause my life is so dry, that's why I feel like i'm living a lie

[Hook: Kat Dahlia]
So you a gangsta, that don't impress me none
You say you a gangsta, ain't seen a thing you done
I do it all on myself,  I ain't getting help
From no one, from no one

[Verse 2:DaykoN]
Hustle like I’m broke
Your stuff is just a joke
It’s all on me and I bet I never choke
I killed your flow with style
Wanted to try this again
I believe inchances
Only in certain circumstances
For example, not in romances
Maybe cus I've been damaged
I can never understand this
Girls always playing games with emotions
Going and making all of this commotion
And then they say its cus you need to show more devotion
And essentially what Im spittin is
A fear of commitment with
Everything that means gettin with
You and everything that you represent
But I'm spent, I made a Splash, earned my Stripes but don't thank me;
Yo, coach.. I'm Cool Running things with "no Candy"
You said a couple things that I find quite funny
But your crew "should've come with a mute" like wise monkeys

[Hook: DaykoN and Kat Dahlia]
So you a gangsta, that don't impress me none
You say you a gangsta, ain't seen a thing you done
I do it all on myself,  I ain't getting help
From no one, from no one
