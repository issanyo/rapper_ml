Verse 1:
I made my mind
I said I'd never fall for you
No, not this time
Not after the way you fucked me up
You went through the grapevine
And I've been moving on
Just like old times
Baby, you've been popping up

Hook:
Now I've got someone else
You show up back from hell
Right back in your spell

You acting all brand new
Never got this from you
Not when I wanted to

Chorus:
Cause you're a manipulator
Use me like I'm your entertainer
Heart my love like a heartbreaker
Mani- Manipulator
Manipulator

Verse 2:
Ain't no question
You know that I'm a fool for you
Just when I think you're done
You're reaching out the blue
Only get your attention when theres no one else you're talking to
Soon as I get what I want I never hear from you

Hook:
Now I've got someone else
You show up back from hell
Right back in your spell

You acting all brand new
Never got this from you
Not when I wanted to

Chorus:
Cause you're a manipulator
Use me like I'm your entertainer
Heart my love like a heartbreaker
Mani- Manipulator
Manipulator

Bridge:
You (x8)
Got this power over me
You (x8)
You never set me free
You (x8)
Got this power over me
You (x8)
You never set me free

Chorus:
Cause you're a manipulator
Use me like I'm your entertainer
Heart my love like a heartbreaker
Mani- Manipulator
