[Verse 1]

You know everything about this train
The wheels movin' already, and that steam is blowin' so heavy

Standin' at the station like a bank with a claim
Pockets empty but ready, cause' my words are stamped and indebted

This is so sweet, you were on the other side of the street, with no seeds
With no trees, ain't' got no green

Dug a hole into my garden, took a piece of every root that I started
Cause' I wasn't guarded. Put my trust in the lust of a dream that you wanted

[Hook]

The witness, the witness, is unjust
(Well there goes my fuckin' trust)
A surface, the purpose, contentious
(Well there goes my fuckin' trust)
The witness, the witness, is unjust
(Well there goes my fuckin' trust.)

Dug a hole into my garden, took a piece of every root that I started
Cause' I wasn't guarded, cause I wasn't guarded

[Verse 2]

You knew everything about this train
These wheels have never been on a track
You took my hand and led me down your path

Its gone too far to start turnin' back
You tryna' say we better than that

When the ink went dry with that pen I signed
You stabbed it in my back

Sick to the stomach, and im sick to the brain
You got a piece of every single word I say

But baby whos to blame?, I bought into the game
Now you got all to gain

[Hook]

This ones for you, the vine with the
This ones for you, the vine with the
This ones for you, the vine with the thorns

And now my gardens all yours
And now my gardens all yours
