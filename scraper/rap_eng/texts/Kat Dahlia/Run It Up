[Verse 1]
I know that you think you're gonna get it
I know that this bought attention gets you off
When the waitress asks you "Cash or credit?"
You never ever hesitate to spend it all

[Pre-Chorus]
Butterflies all in your tummy
Sugar bears like lots of honey
You say you hate hoes, well, isn't that funny?
Cause we never ever talk about money

[Chorus]
Pulling out your wallet all day
And I never hear you complain
Really, what you think I'm gonna say?
Take that bill and run it up
20s, 50s, 100s
20s, 50s, 100s
Take that bill and run it up
20s, 50s, 100s
20s, 50s, 100s

[Verse 2]
You make it to spend it like it's nothing
You put all your problems on your credit card
Boy, these shopping habits get expensive
So I don't see why I shouldn't play along

[Pre-Chorus]
Butterflies all in your tummy
Sugar bears like lots of honey
You say you hate hoes, well, isn't that funny?
Cause we never ever talk about money

[Chorus]
Pulling out your wallet all day
And I never hear you complain
Really, what you think I'm gonna say?
Take that bill and run it up
20s, 50s, 100s
20s, 50s, 100s
Take that bill and run it up
20s, 50s, 100s
20s, 50s, 100s

[Bridge]
I'mma sip on this wine
And I'mma make sure I have a good time
And all my friends say that I'm bad, but I don't mind
Cause I know what I'm 'bout to have when he hits my line
I'mma sip on this wine
And I'mma make sure I have a good time
And all my friends say that I'm bad, but I don't mind
Cause I know what I'm 'bout to have when he hits my line

[Chorus]
Pulling out your wallet all day
And I never hear you complain
Really, what you think I'm gonna say?
Take that bill and run it up
20s, 50s, 100s
20s, 50s, 100s
Take that bill and run it up
20s, 50s, 100s
20s, 50s, 100s
