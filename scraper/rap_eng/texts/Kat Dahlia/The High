[Verse 1]
You made your promises
I held on believing in all of them
Loves timeless, that's what you said
So whys your past coming back for its revenge?
My arms, yeah they're reaching for stars
But they're covered in scars
Oh baby you're the beating of my heart
Yeah your touch left a mark
I'm no light, I'm no dark
Oh baby you're the most important high

[Hook]
Baby we fly so high
Feeling like we could live forever and we're going straight for heaven
You and I
You say it's alright
You wipe off the tears from my heart
You say you're gonna love me better
For for now and for forever
You and I

[Verse 2]
You searched for love in vain
I'm yearning help but babe would it change?
My arms, yeah they're reaching for stars
But they're covered in scars
Oh baby you're the beating of my heart
Yeah, your touch left a mark
I know light, I know dark
Oh baby you're the most important high

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
You left a stain
And now I wear it like I'm wearing my own name
Are we the same?
You throw your spite, I'll take a bite
So who's to blame?
We're back on the high

[Hook]

Baby we fly so high
Feeling like we could live forever and we're going straight for heaven
You and I
You say it's alright
You wipe off the tears from my heart
You say you're gonna love me better
For for now and for forever
Its a lie, but its a lie

[Outro]
Feeling like we could live forever and we're going straight for heaven
You and I (x4)
