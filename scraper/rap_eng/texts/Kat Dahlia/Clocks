[Verse 1: Kat Dahlia]
Black night, cocaine
Re-up, make rain oh
We so about it!
Sun down, gold chain
My cup, my jane oh
We so about it...
We live in the jungle, we cocky but humble
You don't wanna rumble, speak up bitch don't mumble
You want it you got it, supply for the party
Bitch, I'll be your preacher, I get this shit started!

[Hook]
When the clock strikes 12
I'mma set it off just like I wanna
Ooh baby, when the clock strikes 12
We gon' turn it up don't tell your mama
Yeahehehehehe

[Verse 2]
White noise, propane
Black doors, no name oh
We so about it!
Red lips no taste, red eyes no hay oh
We so about it...
I don't got pajamas, I do what I wanna
I'm out for the night, yeah I'll sleep in the corner
I live in these streets, I don't care if they're haunted
It's hot on my block, if you slip you're a goner...

[Bridge]
'Cuz when the clock strikes 12, all the freaks come out and play, eh
And when the clock strikes 12, we gon' ride it like a train, eh
You wanna ride with me eh eh, come baby come and ride my train
You wanna ride with me eh eh...

[Hook]

We so about it!
