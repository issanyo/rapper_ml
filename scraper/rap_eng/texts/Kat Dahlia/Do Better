[Intro]
Guy 1:'S'mofo butter layin' me to da' BONE! Jackin' me up... tight me!

Woman: Oh stewardess! I speak jive

Stewardess: All right. Would you tell him to just relax and I'll be back as soon as I can with some medicine?
Woman: Jus' hang loose, blood

[Verse 1]
Could have run to my arms, but you run to the rocks
How do I heal all these scars after you've taken your shots?
And my faith is in my hands and my vice is on my mask
I guess God can't understand what I've been trying to ask
And now I'm losing every hand
And somehow I lost my grasp
And my mind's in chains and bands
From memories of our past
I guess God can't understand
What I've been trying to ask

[Hook x2]
And he says I know, I know, I know, (I know, I know)
I hurt you once before (before, before)
But I can do better (do better, do better, do better)
Please let me do better (better)

[Verse 2]
If I tried to be blind
Through the signs I'd decide
You are real, you are mine
But I ain't blind
I'm ain't trying for you
Baby I resign
And I'm hearing all the chimes
I'll follow til' I find
And if I had a thousand lives
I would leave you a thousand times
And my mind goes through the lines
And memories of your crimes
I ain't trying for you
Baby I resign

[Hook x2]
And he says I know, I know, I know, (I know, I know)
I hurt you once before (before, before)
But I can do better (do better, do better, do better)
Please let me do better (better)

[Verse 3]
Tell myself I couldn't care less
Whatcha doing if you're a mess?
I ain't trying for you
I put you to rest
For a reason
Staying strong is my test
Baby you thought you had me
In my way you did
I realized you ain't shit
Now I don't need you
I can confess
It's for a reason
This is my test

[Hook x2]
And he says I know, I know, I know, (I know, I know)
I hurt you once before (before, before)
But I can do better (do better, do better, do better)
Please let me do better (better)
