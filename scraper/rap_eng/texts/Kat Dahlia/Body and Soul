[Verse 1]
Come across me with that hit
Can't tell if we're flying or swerving right off a cliff
If you got more offerings, you know you ain't gotta twist my wrist
Show me you're dirtiest water, I'll bathe in it

[Pre-Chorus]
But, just give me a sign
I'm what you like
Does this feel right?
You and I
But, just give me a sign
I'm what you like
You and I, yeah

[Chorus]
I may have a confession on my lips
And I can't tell if you already know
But, if you want to keep me company, maybe love me
I wouldn't mind that at all
And yeah, I got a problem in my hips
And I don't wanna solve it all alone
So, if you wanna keep me company, maybe love me
Give me your body and soul

[Post-Chorus]
Body and soul
Body and soul
Body and soul
Body and soul

[Verse 2]
I'd do whatever you insist
My heart's so thirsty, need your love to water it
Never thought someone like you, no one like you exists
If they told me that I was dreaming, I'd be convinced

[Pre-Chorus]
But, just give me a sign
I'm what you like
Does this feel right?
You and I
But, just give me a sign
I'm what you like
You and I, yeah

[Chorus]
I may have a confession on my lips
And I can't tell if you already know
But, if you want to keep me company, maybe love me
I wouldn't mind that at all
And yeah, I got a problem in my hips
And I don't wanna solve it all alone
So, if you wanna keep me company, maybe love me
Give me your body and soul

[Post-Chorus]
Body and soul
Body and soul
Body and soul
Body and soul

[Bridge]
Things that I would do
Damn, I really want you
Damn, I really want you
Things that I would do
Damn, I really want you
Damn, I really want you
Things that I would do
Damn, I really want you
Things that I would do
Damn, I really want you

[Chorus]
I may have a confession on my lips
And I can't tell if you already know
But, if you want to keep me company, maybe love me
I wouldn't mind that at all
And yeah, I got a problem in my hips
And I don't wanna solve it all alone
So, if you wanna keep me company, maybe love me
Give me your body and soul

[Post-Chorus]
Body and soul
Body and soul
Body and soul
Your body and soul
Your body and soul
Your body and soul
Your body and soul
Your body and soul
