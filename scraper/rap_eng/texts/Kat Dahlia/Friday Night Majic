[Chorus]
What you say
What you say baby
I got that thing that make 'em all go crazy
Go all day
Go all day baby
I'll serve you, turn you out as if you paid me

[Verse]
Baby I'm just keeping it simple ooohhh
Studying you, making me mental ooohhh
Take my time on you
Wouldn't that be cool
Cause you're the one I wanna get into

[Refrain]
Take a chance
Take a chance
It's a toss up but the dice still rolling
Take a chance
Take a chance on me
I'm at the table babe and I ain't folding

[Verse 2]
Baby I'm just keeping it simple ooohhh
Studying you, making me mental ooohhh
Take my time on you
Wouldnâ€™t that be cool
Cause you're the one I wanna get into

Giving it up
