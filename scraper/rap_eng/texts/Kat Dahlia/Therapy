[Verse 1]
If I'm the one goin' on a guilt trip
Why are you the one here packin' your shit
You know me, you know me
Always ready, what you see
Is what you're getting
Keep'n one thing steady
I'm consistently petty
You know me, you know me
If I don't agree
I'mma argue if you let me

[Pre-Chorus]
How can I ever say goodbye
To all my pride, so toxic I can't let go

[Chorus]
I'm talkin' to a stranger
I think my mind's in danger
He's got all the answers
He's educated, I'm an emotional wreck
I'm talkin' to a stranger
I think my mind's in danger
And he's got all the answers
He's educated, I'm an emotional wreck

[Verse 2]
If I'm the one goin' on a guilt trip
Why are you the one here packin' your shit
You know me, you know me
Always ready, what you see
Is what you're getting
Keep'n one thing steady
I'm consistently petty
You know me, you know me
If I don't agree
I'mma argue if you let me

[Pre-Chorus]
How can I ever say goodbye
To all my pride, so toxic I can't let go

[Chorus]
I'm talkin' to a stranger
I think my mind's in danger
And he's got all the answers
He's educated, I'm an emotional wreck
I'm talkin' to a stranger
I think my mind's in danger
And he's got all the answers
He's educated, I'm an emotional wreck (I'm an emotional wreck)

[Outro]
Man that's fucking good
It's just good
Like, I don't know
This is good stuff
It's just good yogurt
Wait till you get to five yogurts
