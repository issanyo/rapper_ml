[Verse 1]
It's been weeks since you don't sleep at home
You and me, we were inseparable
Who knew you would be so cynical?
The damage done is irreversable

[Chorus]
But If I knew you'd make it so hard
I would've never ever begged you to stay
And If I knew you'd make it so hard
I would've never ever begged you to stay ay ay
I woulda never ever begged you to stay, yeah ay ay ay ay ay


[Verse 2]
It's been weeks since we have even spoke
Are you feeling any kind of sorrow? Silent sorrow?
If you would just acknoledge how I feel
Then we could re-negotiate the deal
But you got up and you cleared the closets
Never thought you'd go and leave
I guess you were one to try and fix this as bad as me, ay ay

[Chorus]
But If I knew you'd make it so hard
I would've never ever begged you to stay
Yeah If  I knew you'd make it so hard
I would've never begged you to stay ay ay
I woulda never ever begged you to stay, yeah ay ay ay ay ay


[Verse 3]
Oh my girl, she wanna lie to me
Oh my girl, she made us a tragedy
Oh my girl, she's tryna run away
Oh my girl, like a fool I been broke ever since you went away ay ay

[Chorus]
But If I knew you'd make it so hard
I would've never ever begged you to stay
Yeah If  I knew you'd make it so hard
I would've never begged you to stay ay ay
I woulda never ever begged you to stay, yeah ay ay ay ay ay
