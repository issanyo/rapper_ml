[Verse 1]
Is it crazy that I want you to stay
When I tell you to leave
When I tell you go
Is it crazy that I say your name
More times a day
Than I say my own
Tell me baby is it crazy?
Tell me baby is it crazy?
Is it crazy when you’re gone for a minute
I’m missing you, Yeah I feel alone
Is it crazy that I’m jealous of them bitches
When they get your time
And I know its wrong
But tell me is it crazy?
Yeah, I need to know if it’s crazy
Damn


[Pre-Chorus]
Cause I ain't been myself
Lately somethings going on
Nah boy I ain't even slept
I been up all night long
In my head
Trying to figure out what I want what I do
What I don’t

[Chorus]
Is it crazy all them answers is you
Tell me cuz its blowing my mind
Tell me cuz I don’t understand
How someone just can walk into your life
And everything before them you forget
Is it crazy?
Tell me what’s going on
I need to know
Cause I ain't tryna lose myself
Or lose control
Baby tell me the truth
I need to know
Is it crazy?
Baby is it crazy?

[Verse 2]
Is it crazy that I told my ex don’t call no more cuz I’m in love?
Is it crazy that I keep your shirt right here just to smell your cologne?
Damn that sounds crazy
Tell me is it crazy

[Pre-Chorus]
Cause I ain't been myself
Lately somethings going on
Nah boy I ain't even slept
I been up all night long
In my head
Trying to figure out what I want what I do
What I don’t

[Chorus]
Is it crazy all them answers is you
Tell me cause its blowing my mind
Tell me cause I don’t understand
How someone just can walk into your life
And everything before them you forget

[Bridge]
Is it crazy?
Is it crazy? (crazy)
Is it crazy? (crazy)
Is it crazy?
Tell me is it crazy?
Is it crazy?
Is it crazy?

[Chorus]
Well if it is I’ll just be crazy for you
Baby cuz it’s blowing my mind
Tell me cuz I don’t understand
How someone just can walk into your life
And everything before them you forget

[Outro]
I'm crazy crazy crazy for you
I'm crazy crazy crazy for you
