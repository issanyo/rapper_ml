Said he was fearless. (Yeah)
Said he was brave

But he was too haunted, to ever be saved
But I faced you, by myself
Every night you, lost a fight to, the stash on your shelf

And you'd breathe, evil in and out
Slowly, awareness is fading out


[Chorus]
Here comes his twisted smile, and that wicked raised eyebrow
Staring at me, Our legs are falling to the ground

And if I try to understand, All the workings of this man
Id be losing every hand, hes at the devils command. (x2)

Said I would leave him (Yeah)
But I would always stay

Didn't have the courage, to leave our love in disarray
So i'd face you, by myself. Every night you, lost a fight to, the stash on your shelf


[Chorus]
And you'd breathe, evil in and out
Slowly, our love is fading out

Here comes his twisted smile, and that wicked raised eyebrow
Staring at me,our legs are falling to the ground

And when I try to understand, all the workings of this man
Id be losing every hand, hes at the devils command. (x2)
