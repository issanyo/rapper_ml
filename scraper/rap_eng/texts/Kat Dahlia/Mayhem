One bag of mad something about to gwaan

Roll up inna the club and it's a big thunderstorm
All eyez on me hot gyal protocol
The place a kick up bere dust when we're gone
Defibrillator shock them...clear
We work hard and we play hard
Problems when we roll out me and mi squad
All if the cash done me draw me black card
From Africa to yard me set the standard
We chipping and chopping and pimping and popping and flying and yachting no we not stopping no
Country hopping layovers for shopping no shakiness no flopping

We causing mayhem
Everybody causing mayhem
Yes it's a problem
Jump around and blaze off the ceiling
When we come we set off alarm

Mayhem everybody causing mayhem
Yes it's the weekend
Jump around and blaze off the ceiling
When we come we set off alarm

Pull Up
Alarm
Alarm
Alarm
Alarm

When we come we set off alarm

Coming for cash and wallet, no direct deposit, no degree from college but I'm dripped in knowledge
Strutting around the world so our heels ainâ€™t polished
Chilling with my girls with the crip and chronic
And him never get a body like so, him never see a face cute so
Him never get a wine like so
But if him get a wine like so  him nah go know wah fi do

We causing mayhem
Everybody causing mayhem
Yes it's a problem
Jump around and blaze off the ceiling
When we come we set off alarm

Mayhem everybody causing mayhem
Yes it's the weekend
Jump around and blaze off the ceiling
When we come we set off alarm

Pull Up
Alarm
