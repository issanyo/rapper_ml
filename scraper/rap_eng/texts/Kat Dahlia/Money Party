[Intro]
Hi-i-oh!
Hi-i-i-oh-oh-oh!
Hi-i-i-oh!
Ah-aye...

[Verse 1]
Yeah, we on the rooftop
Party everyday-ay-ay-ay
Red-striped tube socks
That’s my man José-ay-ay-ay
And he smoke the mota (ha!)
I told him pass it this a way-ay-ay
He got a girl he knocked up
She don’t let him come out and play-ay

[Pre-Chorus]
We got the beans, got the lean for the fiends
It’s a good party, yeah
We never sleep, we just run from the dream
It’s a good party, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
We're close to the clouds, one life we got
Roof caving in, we about to drop
Put the worries down, drop it like it’s hot
Show me the money, money, money
Wanna party, party, party?
Three shots in, not one regret
Looking at my one, "Do you feel it yet?"
Got a cutie in my face asking, "Have we met?"
I got the money, money, money
Wanna party, party, party?

[Verse 2]
Zoned-out head knocks
Looking like we 'bout to break-ay-ay-ay
Boombox spittin' 2Pac
He was so damn sex-ay-ay-ay
I wish I had his number-er-er
‘Cause all these dudes are the sa-a-ame
They sniffin' out for the tuna
They want that fish fillet

[Pre-Chorus]
We got the beans, got the lean for the fiends
It’s a good party, yeah
We never sleep, we just run from the dream
It’s a good party, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
We're close to the clouds, one life we got
Roof caving in, we about to drop
Put the worries down, drop it like it’s hot
Show me the money, money, money
Wanna party, party, party?
Three shots in, not one regret
Looking at my one, "Do you feel it yet?"
Got a cutie in my face asking, "Have we met?"
I got the money, money, money
Wanna party, party, party?

[Bridge]
Little green dragons, I just took a shot of absinthe
With baby by the pool, damn, did that shit really happen?
I can’t te-e-e-e-ell
Think my face just failed
My body just got on a plane
Leslie Nielsen took my name
And I'm try to get it back
But can’t remember a damn thing
And Polly's in the corner tryna hit on Kurt Cobain
And Bobby’s telling me when music hits you feel no
Pain

[Chorus]
We're close to the clouds, one life we got
Roof caving in, we about to drop
Put the worries down, drop it like it’s hot
Show me the money, money, money
Wanna party, party, party?
Three shots in, not one regret
Looking at my one, "Do you feel it yet?"
Got a cutie in my face asking, "Have we met?"
I got the money, money, money
Wanna party, party, party?

[Outro]
Party, party, party
Give me the money, money
I wanna party, party
Got the money, money, money
I got the money, money
I got the money, money, money
