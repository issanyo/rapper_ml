You say you a gangsta, that don't impress me none
You say you a gangsta, ain't seen a thing you done
I do it all on myself, I ain't getting help
From no one, from no one

Yeah I'm young, 21, living in a crazy world
But I know the difference between a man and a herb
You frontin like you got it, claim they hittin on your wallet
Gucci tellin you the time and you watch it
Now I ain't stuntin like my daddy, he's livin with my grammie
Used to be a big baller, he's survivin off of gamblin
But I love him, he's my daddy, yeah I love him he's my daddy
Put him in a big house, before I ever see a grammy
And my mommy started working days at the church
Finding faith in God 'cause the real world hurts
So much evil lurks, they just make us a work
But we can't find a work

How I love my man and my girls, in a one bedroom
South beach lifestyle, they just paying for the view

Mommy on the couch, since she was 42
Sacrificing for the kids, 'cause that's what mommys do
So I smoke my spliff, I spliff it hard
Candy sister stop my voice is getting too harsh
So I sobered up, and my thoughts they rush
And now I think of you behind bars
Cross state lines, they spliffin' good
In Miami you catch a charge
And the whole family tears apart

You say you a gangsta, that don't impress me none
You say you a gangsta, ain't seen a thing you done
I do it all on myself, I ain't getting help
From no one, from no one

You say you a gangsta, that don't impress me none
You say you a gangsta, ain't seen a thing you done
I do it all on myself, I ain't getting help
From no one, from no one

And this recession's so depressin
My parents don't stop stressin
Just hopin I learned all their lessons
And I'm paying for this session
I'm paying for this session
And I'm paying rent, food, clothes, phone, christmas presents
6 shots in, I'm just countin all my blessings
No days off baby I ain't restin
I told my sins, now I'm done confessin

You say you a gangsta, but that don't impress me none
You say you a gangsta, ain't seen a thing you done
I do it all on myself, I ain't getting help
From no one, from no one

You say you a gangsta, but that don't impress me none
You say you a gangsta, ain't seen a thing you done
I do it all on myself, I ain't getting help
From no one, from no one

On way to the top, I make with what I got
You want my number baby, I'm on a mission, catch up
Men sellin love like thieves
But when the girlie leaves, he'll stop flirtin with me
So I took my heart off my sleeve
Never trust a man 'cause they all hungry
Yeah they all hungry
Never trust a man 'cause they all hungry

Right when you thought you had me
Baby you just lost someone
Finally got over you, baby time to move on
Never learned your lesson, ain't even gonna question
Why it went so wrong
Right when you thought you had me
Baby you just lost someone
Finally got over you, baby time to move on
Never learned your lesson, ain't even gonna question
Why it went so wrong

You say you a gangsta, that don't impress me none
You say you a gangsta, ain't seen a thing you done
