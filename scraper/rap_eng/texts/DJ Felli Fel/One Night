[Intro:]
New Boyz "New Boyz"
Hey "Hey, Hey"
Hey "Hey, Hey"
But it was just a 1 Night..

[Chorus:]
She thought I said I loved her [echoes]
I think I said I love you [echoes]
But baby, I'm hungover [echoes]
& you need to realize "Realize"
That this was just a 1 Night stand

[Legacy:]
I'm Turnt up
Just hit the function
Lookin' for a bad bitch
With the Gucci pumps & shades
Tryin' to find the one that'll come in
Just get to lunch, then just get to humpin'
Checkmark, there goes one, no acne, with her hair all done
Got her makeup on, bracelet on & the heels make me wanna take that home
Should I take her to my room? Quick think
I took her to my room & we hit sinks, counters, dressers, sheets, stairs
We got done, told her "You can sleep here."
The next day, I woke up at 12:00 at noon, I rolled over & I screamed, "Who the hell are you?"
The fat chick said, "Damn, don't remember me baby?"
This shit crazy

[Chorus:]
She thought I said I loved her [echoes]
I think I said I love you [echoes]
But baby, I'm hungover [echoes]
& you need to realize "Realize"
That this was just a 1 Night stand

[Ben J:]
I'm Turnt up
Yeah, I know how good
I get a chick who wanna kick it, now she wanna hit it
I don't blame her
She know what's up, I said "wussup"
She came with the pumps & she turned me up
She was cute, make up, nails & feet done
Long hair, arched back
Now that's the reason
To ??
You know what's up, lil' mami
We both faded, feelin' all types of naughty
She wanna wait to go for a 4th
But I only got 1 Night & my source
I endorce the fact that
Attack the drink in me, the freak in me
The kink in her, she came to see me
& I ain't gonna stand around, I'm a take her to the telly
We can both roll around in [laugh] & I ain't gonna let her in
I'm a kick her ass out ????? [laugh]

[Chorus:]
She thought I said I loved her [echoes]
I think I said I love you [echoes]
But baby, I'm hungover [echoes]
& you need to realize "Realize"
That this was just a 1 Night stand

[Legacy:]
"A 1 Night"
Ayy
"This was a 1 Night stand"
Your breath suck
I never liked you
'Cause, baby, I was just drunk

[Chorus:]
She thought I said I loved her [echoes]
I think I said I love you [echoes]
But baby, I'm hungover [echoes]
& you need to realize "Realize"
That this was just a 1 Night stand
