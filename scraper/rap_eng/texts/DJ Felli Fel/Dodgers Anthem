Ice Cube:
Play ball
Yo, what up?
Yeah, Dodgers .. baby
Hey yo felly
How do you kill a bird with a bat?
We ain’t trippin on no Cardinals, no Red Sox, no A's, no tigers
It’s all about that World Series Ring
Don't mean a thing if you ain’t got that ring
Tell em yall

Hook:
Started from the bottom now we here
Started from the bottom now my whole team here
Started from the bottom now we here
Started from the bottom now the whole team here

Started from the bottom now we here
Started from the bottom now the whole team here
LA Dodgers now we here
LA Dodgers we here

[Verse 1: Ice Cube]
LA Dodgers, other say doodgers
Win the World Series, baby show your hooters!
This is for y’all that think we caught the vapors
No I’ve been down since Fernando Valenzuela
It's the young hog, Yasiel Puig
Come to the plate, give the city what it need
Tryin’ to make a scene at Chavez Ravine
One big swing to bring LA the ring
Bleed Dodger Blue, Tommy Lasorda
I think I saw an old man walking on water
Hey y’all I’m on Crenshaw with Clayton Kershaw
He got the Cy Young, who wanna playball
It got tragic, I called up Magic
And everybody know that Magic flip the cabbage
Pop Bubbly with Vin Scully so lovely, to win in 2013

[Fans cheering]
Announcer:
High fly ball into right field, SHE IS GONE!!!!

[Verse 2: Tyga]
T Raww's on, with a dodgers cap
All blue snap bandana, where a mirror at?
Exit of the five, now Magic put the city on the map
Pitching like Ryu, I hit it like Matt
Ball so hard went pro
You could find me at the last king storm ?
You can hate it or love it, Killa leave me alone
I’ll be the king so the thrill never gone, two on, killa
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah ..yeah yeah yeah LA LA

[Announcer voice:]
In a year that was so improbable, the impossible has happened!
