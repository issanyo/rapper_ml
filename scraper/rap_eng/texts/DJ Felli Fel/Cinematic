[Intro:]
Ah... yeah
I'll be your star
I'll be your star

Come make a movie with me
Come make a movie
Come make a movie with me
Come make a movie
Come make a movie

[Verse 1:]
Yeah
The camera's ready
Hold it steady
We gon' let it go
The lights are flashing
Gimme action
Let me see a show

'Cuz when we tape
We gon' make it like a magazine
Ya wanna see me do it
Bump it on the plasma screen

And it like anybody else it gonna see
I'mma put it up and keep it just for me
So let me turn it on
And I can be your star
'Cuz you know I go hot (oh)

[Chorus:]
Gonna make you cinematic
It's not magic
Gonna make you cinematic
So good at it

[Verse 2:]
Hot as an oven
Wearing nothing but a bellyring
I turn it over
I'mma show ya' how I do my thing

And I ain't stopping
Got it poppin' on the video
It's so erotic
So exotic when we're physical

And it like anybody else it gonna see
I'mma put it up and keep it just for me
So let me turn it on
And I can be your star
'Cuz you know I go hot (oh)

[Chorus:]
Gonna make you cinematic
It's not magic
Gonna make you cinematic
So good at it
(If you're trying to make that funky tonight...
And your ready for that close up
Then get ya xxx up high)

[DJ Felli Fel:]
Now don't stop get it, get it
Roll that tape and let me hit it (OW!)

[Jessi Malay]
You got it
Hey, hey
You got it
You got it
Hey, hey
You got it

[Bridge:]
You got me feeling ready
And I'm over with doing thangs
I never expected to do secretly
I do for you

You got me feeling crazy
We're taping a freaky scene
Now, you can show them your body
(Oh, you can show them your body)

[Chorus:]
(Oh)
Gonna make you cinematic
It's not magic
(Come make your magic with me)
Gonn' make you cinematic
So good at it
(Gonna make a move tonight)
Gonna make you cinematic
It's not magic
Gonna make you cinematic
So good at it

(I'll be your superstar)
Come make a movie with me
Come make a movie
(I'll be your star)
Come make a movie with me

Come make a movie
(I'll be your star)
Come make a movie
(I'll be your star)
Come make a movie
(I'll be your star)
