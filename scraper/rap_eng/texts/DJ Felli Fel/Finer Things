Uh, Felli Fel, Neyo, Yeesy, Calm Down, Easy, Easy

Keep Show'in You The Miner Thing
Let Me, Show You The Finer Thing
Let Me, Show You What You been Missing

Right About This Time Raise Your Glasses
What's My Modivation, That Ass is
Start A Conversation, Like As If
You Really Want To Know About A Day In That Shit
Go Ahead And Tell The Dj To Play Swizz
So I Ain't Gotta Tell These Hoes Who I Is
Bitches Hatin Again That's Music Too Me Ear's
What's You Think My Fuel Was For All Of These Years?
I'm Inspired When People Don't Like Me
It Keep Me Writing So Exiting
She Said No Just sight seeing
Maybe That's Just Because You Ain't Found The Right Thing? Yeah!

Keep Tellin' Me You Got A Man

But I Be See'in You With Nigga's That Ain't Right, Round Hard Top

Keep Tellin' Me You Got A Man
But He Can't Do What I Can
Let Me, Show You What You Been Missing
Keep Show'in You The Miner Thing
Let Me, Show You The Finer Thing

The Life I Live, Fit For A King
Now All I Need Fine Little Dime That's Sharin My Shine We Sit Back And Watch The Haters Go Blind

I'm Not Tryna Keep It Lost Too A Minimum
If You Associating Been In Em Winnin Em, Then I say I Was Nine Out Of Ten Of Them
Frankly I No Ben And Them I Like Spendin Them
You Like The Smooth And Can White Lend'in Them
You Wan't A Thug, Hey I Look Good In A Timb
You Might Win Some, But Everybody Lost One
I Put A Check On That Like Airforce One's
It's Easier To Lose Her Then To Find Her, So Wine Her And Dine Her, And Treat Her To The Finer
Things, Lines, From The Top Designers
Bling, Shine, Like You Tryn'a Blind Her
These Are Just Reminder's
Just Too Sign Her
Show Her You Find Her
Eight, One Of A Kind Her
See Alote Of Ass, And That One Behind Her!
Let's Just Say That I'm Diggin That Like A Miner, Ya Digg
