Check this out, listen to me, listen
Life is tricky I'm picky baby, but I just spotted you
Doin' your thing, g-string, shoe string point of view, hey
Lend me ya body, you got me in a zone
Bet a million and a half cash, I can make you explode
You dont wanna break the code, you want a day of Combs
I can take you on outer limits away from home
Where your girls pop, mammi wallin' for sure
In the middle of the club doin' her rodeo show
The whole scene steamy, wet dreamy
Invisible sex clean me, incredible sex, you need me
Ya ease me, please me baby, I maybe am little crazy
But in a way that make ya baby page me
Dont make me get buck in here!
Shorty drop it to the ground like she ain't got manners
Too much booty for one man to handle
When all I need is a one night scandal
And Ima get buck in here!
Damn lil' momma you know you fit my standards
Youre the type to make me grip that handle
Lick shots in the air, bustin' at random
While you make it clap clap clap clap clap
(You gotta shake that thang, shake that thang)
While you make it clap clap clap clap clap
(Just shake that thang, shake that thang)
She can make it clap like a standin' ovation
Spin like my record at the radio station
Feel the sensation, I put it right there
They be like Luda, I be like yea!
You like it like that, dontchya baby?
The flow's insane, and the stroke is crazy
I stroke so good, like Tiger Woods
And I roar like a tiger would
My livelihood, is not Hollywood
I'm still Southside Atlanta, thats a lively hood
A circus, big top, like Ringling Brothers
If you wanna learn something, bring your mothers
Sit back and observe, invite some friends
We can mix it all up, like juice and gin
Felli on the celly with a couple of twins
Cuz tonight, damn right, we gonna do it again
Dont make me get buck in here!
Shorty drop it to the ground like she ain't got manners
Too much booty for one man to handle
When all I need is a one night scandal
And Ima get buck in here!
Damn lil' momma you know you fit my standards
Youre the type to make me grip that handle
Lick shots in the air, bustin' at random
While you make it clap clap clap clap clap
(You gotta shake that thang, shake that thang)
While you make it clap clap clap clap clap
(Just shake that thang, shake that thang)
Listen, women lace em, g for a jet from em
Twist em, crooked, cell phone numbers, private
Flip em, change em, prissy and boogie the hood
Game of taste em, trissy's Im runnin' em good
Leather or silk, I melt them all
Love em, leave em, give em hell for sure
Tell them words they minds and souls deserve
Or give them things they might prefer
Saint Tropez, and mandarin sweet massage oil
Pimp, gamin', grants, and Benzes I tried em
Used to style em, now I just Virgin Island em
Kamasutra freaky
Dont make me get buck in here!
Shorty drop it to the ground like she ain't got manners
Too much booty for one man to handle
When all I need is a one night scandal
And Ima get buck in here!
Damn lil' momma you know you fit my standards
Youre the type to make me grip that handle
Lick shots in the air, bustin' at random
Hold up, hold up, yo yo yo yo
It's your boy Lil Jon, right
It's time to take this thing to another level!
Lets go!
Lets go!
Let me see you get hands up!
Let me see you get hands up!
Let me see you put your drinks up!
Let me see you put your drinks up!
Now get buck in this bitch!
