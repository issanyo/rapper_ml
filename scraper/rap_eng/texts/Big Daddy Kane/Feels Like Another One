When there's something in the air
And the earth is shaking
Something inside me knows
One heart went falling
A premonition in my bones
I can sense it, there it goes
Something about two lovers that changes the world
I can detect it
Seem to reflect it and I say

I feel it in my heart, well
Feels like another one
It gets me in my soul now
It feels like another one

When I look into your eyes
There's a reaction
And I don't need to know what makes it happen
I know I've been in love before
But love's a magic open door
And every time somebody reaches in my heart
I can detect it
I got to reflect it, I say

I feel it in my heart, yeah
Feels like another one
It gets me in my soul now
It feels like another one

(rap1)
I'm lost in the sauce by a force that I can't pause
When I come across the open doors that were yours
It's uncontrollable whenever I'm holding you
With a love that I feel as good as gold with you
So may I address you with a little bit of tenderness and
Togetherness it takes to form a relationship
You know the day that these feelings began I said then
It feels like another one

A premonition in my bones
I can sense it, there it goes
Something about two lovers that changes the world
I can detect it
Got to reflect it

I feel it in my heart, well
Feels like another one
It gets me in my soul now
It feels like another one

(rap2)
When you feel the reaction of physical attraction
And deep in your mind it's pure satisfaction
From the need of true companionship
And once you feel it inside your soul
Oh man you get captivated, elevated, rejuvenated
Fascinated, so many feelings it's hard for me to state
Cause no one can really defy
The power of love taking over and over
Comfort one another, lover to lover
No matter how you avoid it
It's still gonna uncover
When you can't detect it or reflect it
Don't try to neglect it
You gotta respect it
