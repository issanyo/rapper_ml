There's more to love than making love, baby
There's more to love than making love to you
There's more to dreams than dreaming
And baby
I'm not dreaming
There's so much more in me to do to you

Last night I called you on the phone
And you weren't there when I called
So now I'm wondering if you've gone away

Gave you everything a man could give
And now you're gone
And I'll keep on holding on
Cause there's more

There's more to love than making love, baby
There's more to love than making love to you
There's more to dreams than dreaming
And baby
I'm not dreaming
There's so much more in me to do to you

What can I do
Oh, what can I say
To make you feel the way I feel
And make you understand this love is real

I'm just a man
Just living proof of how our life should be
I'm in love
So don't you leave me

Just trying got to do what I got to do
And commit myself to loving you
The pain I felt
And the love we share
I can not see me losing you
All I know is there's more

There's more to love than making love, baby
There's more to love than making love to you
There's more to dreams than dreaming
And baby
I'm not dreaming
There's so much more in me to do to you

There's more to love than making love, baby
There's more to love than making love to you
There's more to dreams than dreaming
And baby
I'm not dreaming
There's so much more in me to do to you

Just trying got to do what I got to do
And commit myself to loving you
The pain I felt
And the love we share
I can not see me losing you
All I know is there's more

There's more to love than making love, baby
There's more to love than making love to you
There's more to dreams than dreaming
And baby
I'm not dreaming
There's so much more in me to do to you
