You ain't lookin in the mouth of maddness
Kid your facin it
Put your game face on and start embracin it
I'm from the streets that first started all
That hatin shit
And n***az used to spell ghetto with the "h" in it
You see the innocent children, from 10 in the building
Get that menacin feelin, but when it's revealed
A 16's just an enterprise you pretend to ride
It seems it's been applied, it's a snoop genocide
N****z ain't showin that they skills is there
N****z ain't tryna build careers
When them guns start to bust and you ain't real prepared
Now your rhymes just a souvenir, from a killed career
Understand I do a lot of renovating myself
Kane ain't never been known for limits breaking my "self"
Club, shootin thug shit, innovatin myself
But you'll never catch the God incriminating my "self"

F'real
Chorus:
Unto God and to Hip Hop yo we stay true
And always remember just what a snake do
Watch those around you cuz they'll be fake too
And never let the game make you

Most of all

Unto God and to Hip Hop stay in circle
There's a lot to see beneath where the dirt is
Dig a little deeper and scratch the surface
Maybe then you'll understand your purpose

Now reflecting on the game kid
I have to say
Much love to the one Jam Master Jay
A loss that hit the world of hip hop like John Lennon
Chapter out of life that prevailed the wrong inning
Still from the Notorious, hearts are shooken
Streets started lookin like we missed a part of Brooklynn
A disappointing flavor that we taste before
But a spots been secured for the late Shakur
The pain was severe when we lost the lid
We try to get by, then turn around and lost Left Eye
We even see how fatal diseases be
Snatchin playaz like Eazy-E, easily
Respect to Freaky Tah, Big L and Big Pun
The big one, who left the Terror Squad forever scarred
Your lifestyle and your musical gift, in the hearts of many
You will truly be missed

[Chorus]

I never claimed to be the kid slangin rocks for Ex
Never claimed to be the kid that be poppin the teks
But if you look its like my name got stock in the jets
That ain't my style though, I simply not wish to flex
But if you want we can sit and talk dollars and checks
And good investments, and what follows it next
You sittin there lookin product and vexed
Tryna screwface, dudes Im tryna face
Go the opposite sex
Take a glass of the Remy, start with the Ex
I never had patron but shit I'll take a shot of it next
