I see the love being shown when I come in here kid
It's like gettin welcomed home from a ten year bid
Glad to see you touchin down
Ain't gon be no fuckin round
Put that, heat to the streets spit the hottest stuff in town
Bench warmers on the block, gotta sit when i start
It would be an honor for me just to spit for ya god
Ain't no need fakin moves im tryna get wit ya squad
I shouldve known that you was home when honey nipples got hard
Its like a, new world order for the women and men
The only cat that be lookin good in linen and timbs
Baby girl your plans might just alter
And your man might default ya'
Saturday night, im the man like travolta
I spit the raw shit, the hardcore shit
All eyes be on me on some real shakur shit
The people still screamin aw shit
Cuz you see i set em straight in '88
School of who, i blow through

I'm from Bedstuy baby represent
Ghetto life mentality, street life regality
You wishin you could come into my neighborhood
I live out there, so dont go there

I'm from Bedstuy baby represent
No matter where we go
As if yall didn't know
You can ask all your people in your borough as well
That Kane nigga keep it thorough as hell

Niggas know I roll wit missionaries that cause obituaries
Wit mad kids to bury for thinkin' that they was gettin near me
Just like a jury the fif'll clear me
Have yall niggas switchin scary to get canary cuz this get hairy
Raised up around, rovers and bug
High rollers and drugs
Only moments of love
When you flow wit your thugs
Walkin round ice cold wit your mug
With that ghetto life mentality, street life regality
Tryna cop a salary to make cheese long
Im from bedstuy baby represent the east strong
While yall haters be singin that Kelis song
What yall wear a g-thong? smack if you breathe long
Best you be's gone cuz for no reason
I give niggas more problems than an old nissan
Cut the mustard and the dijon
I'm comin straight from the Brooknam, region, always keep the heat on
