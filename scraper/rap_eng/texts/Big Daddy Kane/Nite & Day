[Verse 1]
Tell me this baller image that you make yourself
Creating an illusion, you got cake yourself
Not trying to be a lie, you're a fake yourself
Aight, keep fucking around, you're gonna break yourself
You got a misconception about what real is
Spoiling out your 300, but you know what it still is
From empty to pimpley, it's simply not a Bentley
This ain't about movie, just let be what meant be
To floss in extremes, you took your game
But shit, that chicks white gold and platinum look the same
You in your zone, tricking on Patr√≥n
With more shots of silver than a werewolf, be careful
Before we go and say he in the clean
The best way to test is an ATM machine
Here's a fact, youngin', and this is true
If you gotta check your balance, then that shit ain't for you
For real

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Shit, baby girl you said you don't feel appealing
Your body started changing and now you ain't feeling
Like you worthy no more
Them breasts ain't looking perky no more
Them dudes ain't acting thirsty no more
You wondering if you at your brink yet
And sitting at the bar not know what to think yet
Cause not one baller bought you a drink yet
And some young chick got on the same matching pink set
Up under your arms you see your little bit flap
Forget that, shakeweights can't fix that
Used to come up in the club and inspire drama
Now somebody's ass and they [?] mama
Them prom queen days is long gone
Time to realize you playing the wrong song
If these young boys don't understand
Then that probably means it's time for a grown ass man
For real

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Every minute that we be pretending to be
Something that we're not, we cause of an image we see
Lost in the Wheel Of Fortune, well, spin it and see
Instead of fronting I'mma show you ain't no limit to me
You programmed to do what people commonly like
Bringing harm in your life, you need that Garmin device
To navigate you from what fascinate you
Just cause that's what they do, kid, you have to stay true
For real

[Hook]
