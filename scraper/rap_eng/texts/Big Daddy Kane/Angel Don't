VERSE 1

I've seen you coming
And many times you've just passed me by
Oh how I yearn for ya
Can't you see the sparkle in my eyes

Oh, everyday I wait for ya
Just to see the way you comb your hair
Oh girl! I adore ya
There's no other undercover lover to compare

CHORUS

Angel don't
Don't you wanna
Spread your wings and give me love
Angel don't
Don't you wanna
Live a life of ecstasy

VERSE 2

How long must I feel this
Pumping, thumping, throb inside my veins
Love walls so addictive
A just one dose of you is all
I need to ease this pain

Heaven knows I'm pleading
For the day you finally look my way
Oh girl, I'll keep dreaming
Of a romance, enhance, by trance
Baby make me scream oh!!

CHORUS (x2)

RAP (Big Daddy Kane)

As I start to drift
Then you give me that up lift
Simply because you're the girl I wanna get with
And if you take the chance to
Let me enhance you when I romance you
I promise to give you good love
So get with the one you should love
The pumping and thumping and throbbing inside my veins is ready to shove
Out and blossom bloom as we progress
You ready to take it away Morris?
...YES!!
