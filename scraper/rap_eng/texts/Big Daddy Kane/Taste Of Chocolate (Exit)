Yeah
You know, 1990 begins a new decade
And since I got paid and blew up like a live grenade
It's been a three, four year stretch
And I'd just like to thank all of you

Mmm
And this goes to everybody in the entire world
That means the United States, overseas in the U.K
Way in Brazil, Japan, Africa, and everywhere else
I just wanna dedicate this one to you

Here's another groove that I'm bringin' to you kind of mellow
And I just want to say hello
Or should I say peace as I start to release
The poetry that don't cease is never the least
Your feet got to shuffle as I put the muscle in the groove
Cause I'm so smooth
Once you experience a whole Kane rhyme
I'll have you dancin' in a Soul Train line
Pick up the pace and get a taste of B-I-G
D-A-double-D-Y Kane in the place
Doin' the job how you want it done
With lyrics that's bright as the morning sun
So grab one line, rub it on your face like sunshine
And everything else'll combine
This is that particular beat
For all the fellows feelin' mellow to pump in the Jeep
Uhh, also for every girlie
To shamiyo, shamago like Laverne and Shirley
Huh, now wait, now wait, now wait a minute
Uhh! Now check this

I wanna talk about peace and unity and love
Not one, but all of the above
Comin' together like keys on a piano
Black and white to unite and oh man oh man
What joy did we, find
Hard for me to say it sometimes
