[Radio Intro: Dave Rockin' Reel & Roz Noble]
Possibly a lot of rain this afternoon, with thunderstorms, highs in the mid-80s and lows about 75 degrees
It's 11:30 AM on WFDS—We're From the Darkside Radio
This is Dave Rockin' Reel, as we take a caller
Caller, you're on the air
Yeah yeah yeah, and this Roz from Newark and I wanna hear that tune "Can't Wait" by Redman—that tune the bomb, yo!
You got it, coming from The Darkside Radio, this is "Can't Wait"

[Intro: Redman]
Whooooooo! Yo yo yo, comin' to you live
Smokin' mad Phillies with my niggas from the Hoodaville section
And all my niggas from the Weequahic section, word is bond
Somebody said Jamaica Queens in this motherfucker
I don't give a fuck! We gon' set it off like this
Jersey in the fuckin hid-ouse, for your mid-outh

[Verse 1: Redman]
I'm like rah rah, like I had cerebral palsy
My flows be's wet like all you girls' drawers be
Crack the Phills, spread the buddha then the hiddash
Roll it up and then ask, "Who chipped in for the ten bag?"
Et cetera, I roll my blunts with two textures
Pick up fifty bags and then I smoke all the extras
It's the truth, like vodk' one-eighty proof
Don't drop your drawers, I'll fuck through your daisy dukes (True!)
Put your fingers up in the air if you're high (High)
I walk by (by) so eff a drive (by)
I swing up in it, batting average is half as
Good as Reggie Jackson's, that's why you talk backwards
And, uh, chumps be on some Bogart shit like Humphrey
You couldn't beat me if you ran with 21 Jump Street
Or 90210, fuck it, yo
In the movies I'm the nigga puffin' buddha in the back row

[Sampled Chorus: Mary Jane Girls & (Big Daddy Kane)]
I can't wait to get it on
(Check it out, y'all)
I can't wait to get it on
(You don't stop, keep on)
I can't wait to get it on
(Check it out, y'all)
I can't wait to get it on
(You don't stop, keep on)
I can't wait to get it on
(Check it out, y'all)
I can't wait to get it on
(You don't stop, keep on)
I can't wait to get it on
(Check it out, y'all)
I can't wait to get it on
(You don't stop, keep on)

[Verse 2: Redman]
I'm just a smoky boy, I'm from the Land of the Lost
You can't see me, like Charlie Angels' boss, I'm often
Coolin 'round the blid-docks, I rock 'round the clid-dock
My glid-dock cocked, from here to 16th and Lenox
Ask Roger Thomas if I'm gettin scopic
I was milk like two tits, now I'm butter like Blue Bonnet
Now who got the funk? (We got the funk!)
Ay ay, ayo well I got the weed! (We got the blunts!)
I never sniffed, I used to puff woolas in a jam
Back in '88, when it was twenties to the gram
Brizzail, you couldn't feel me in Braille, hell
I write my names on walls in smoke spots when I'm buyin' L
The fly guy with the Force like Luke Sky'
Down for a menage e' trois bitch if you're fly
The Funkadelic, been rockin' mics since the fourth grade
I Terminate like X and I Terminate like Schwarzeneg'
Dum-de-dum, rock like Buju Banton
Soup like wonton, funk by the tons, "D-Rums, Please!"
My whole crew's making cheese
Tonight's the night, baby, so suck up on these, and it's on

[Sampled Chorus: Mary Jane Girls & (Big Daddy Kane)]
I can't wait to get it on
(Check it out, y'all)
I can't wait to get it on
(You don't stop, keep on)
I can't wait to get it on
(Check it out, y'all)
I can't wait to get it on
(You don't stop, keep on)
I can't wait to get it on
(Check it out, y'all)
I can't wait to get it on
(You don't stop, keep on)
I can't wait to get it on
(Check it out, y'all)
I can't wait to get it on
(You don't stop, keep on)

[Verse 3: Redman]
I said I, catch the A-train, to the left
Smoke the choc', I set shit off like Boba Fett
Big up to all my niggas in the housing projects
I'm runnin' up in ya, continue to split your guts
Grab the rail, if you get scared of my lines when I rock well
Got Whit's like Pernell, shit's "The Bomb" like Akinyel'
Rickety rocket, mind deep as the Loch Ness
Waste niggas like toxic, wet like galoshes
Can I handle my biz? (Yes, you can!)
I cause chaos, and bring a lot of Def to Jams
Yes I can, now act stupid I'll pop the trunk, cla-clunk
Now give me a ba-bump, ba-bump
Oh cool, smooth like two "Blue Suede Shoes"
Y'all faggots slept on my Huffman and Koos
Word to Dan, Tan, Pillow, and Cool B
Switchin' speeds like Bruce Lee ridin' a Fuji in a movie
I drop it on the one—fuck the two, three
Funky like a box of coochies on loose leaf

[Outro: Redman]
Yo yo, I said, "Switchin' up speeds like Bruce Lee ridin' a Fuji in a movie."
Heh, I be sayin' some shit!
Now, if you didn't get it—
Laugh now—and then figure the shit out when you get home!
Hahahaha!
