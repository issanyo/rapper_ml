Find me
Find me
Wine me and dine me
Get fuckin' loaded
Party

I want to play guitar
And be a movie star
Be in the B-movies
And take off all my clothes
Who do you want me to be
Who do I wanna be
Who do you want me to be
Get fuckin' loaded

Party
Get fuckin' loaded

Mi numero di telefono
E le 2-7-8-7-8-2-7
Ciao bello ragazz o ciao
Get fuckin' loaded
And how's your money
Are you fuckin' loaded?
Party

Here I am
R-A-W
Put it down the way that I love to do
Verbally that's the best you can get
'Cause y'all come loaded with special effects
A big Benz so that you can floss with it
Ice style 'til your neck's frost-bit
Rocks for your medallion to shine
Dressed head to toe in Italian design
All night trying to ball right
Mack-a-docious, Loaded
Let your neck flow
With shots of X-O
From the first shelf
Don't hurt yourself
You know it's all quite funny to me
It really don't matter what money you see
'Cause while you iced out dressed in Gucci
I can pull your girl buck-naked in a hooptie (what)
