Go
Ain't no party like a bran van party
'cause a bran van party don't stop
It don't stop
Don't quit

Yeah
(I'd like) to put it down baby
Bran van three gee
Now feel me

I make it hot in new york streets
Who draws heat
While you talk sweet
C'mon
Blaze through invading the path
Put it down tight get paid in cash
Been in the game a decade and a half
Superfly style
Yet related to shaft
Sippin' me slow
Girls give me dough
You know one smoother than this
Let me know

Not stressing that little piece of fame
Y'all know who's most critically acclaimed
Your majesty, naturally
Get it all in a large capacity
Rather makin' you smile
Or bring it crucial
I'm gonna live 'til I die in the year three thou'
C'mon

Yo, I don't think they heard me

I ball hard
Any night
Cruise through your town
City lights
As for my game
It be tight
Message to you
Livin' life
Nothing to prove
But something to make
Cutting the cake
Put it in your oven to bake
The rule of the game is
'bout the benjamins
And there ain't no need to guess
Who's got the winning hand
K to the a
N to the e
Player of the day
Then you'll agree
No one does it better
In the pimp game
I'm the trendsetter

Everybody knows
The prognosis
Is discosis
Don't step on my ghepetto's
Pinocchio has got a broken nose
So watch your back bushwacker
You can't deal with the greatest cracker
Everybody knows
The prognosis
Is discosis
