Sticks and stones may break your bones
But you ain’t never felt the wrath of Quincy Jones
Hard to the core, an entrepreneur
And jams that even slam for you and your
Pleasure, as you listen to every measure
Groove with the track as the Q gets fresher

[Quincy Jones]
I’ve been away for a long time
I’m not only back but I’m here to rhyme
So bust a move, cause I am too
Back on the black, more training to do

[QDIII]
So hey young world say “Quincy, Quincy
I need the Dude to correct and convince me”
Teach me the right way, so my eyesight may
See that path that leads to a brighter day

[Quincy Jones]
So if you’re ready to reach for the top
Then never fear, cause I’m back on the block
