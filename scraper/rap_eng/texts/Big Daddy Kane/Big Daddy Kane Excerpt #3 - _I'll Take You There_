BDK: We did that the day that Biz was supposed to record "Nobody Beats the Biz." I came there with the lyrics and knocked on the door. Marley was talking through the chain on the door like, "Nah, Biz ain't here." I'm like, "You remember me? I was here with him the other day." He said, "Well, he ain't here"

I said, "I took the train from Brooklyn." "He ain't here, money -- I don't know what to tell you." So I was like, "Alright, man. Here's the lyrics he's supposed to do today. Just give them to him." And that's when he was like, "Yo, you writing Biz' stuff?" I'm like, "I mean, I wrote that."

So then he took the chain off, and he's like, "Well, how this go? Can you say it for me?" And I said the rhyme. And he said, "Oh yeah, come on in." And then we got to talking, he asked me to rhyme. I spit another rhyme for him and then we worked on a song, and it ended up being "I'll Take You There."
