[Verse 1 - Akil]
Yo, my method for my musical madness
Move and motivate those with musical talents, uh
Read it in bold print, we holdin it down
Liquor shot, hip-hop when we in yo' town
Uhh, master blaster sound
Freak the future far from here and now
With style, release increase the peace, uhh
Bubble with the beat 'til they feelin the heat in the streets
Now each one, teach one, reach one, young gun
On one, listen to the warrior's drum
Beatin up the block with the ghetto hop that knock
And make you wanna crash the spot
And unlock explode (BOOM) the alpha and omega code
With drum rolls and old soul, we uphold
And foretold to scores of six years ago
Fast flow from G. Rap to Kool Moe
Supasyllable, major to the minimal
Every individual, bounce to the tempo yo
Lungs collapse and raps be trapped in
The only way to make it happen, jaw-jappin, fast rappin

[Verse 2 - Zaakir]
Yo, I'm the hot dog that run the hottest monologue
In star poetic inserts and yes y'all s
My speech is like holding two Glocks apiece
The outreach that rock police
The super adventure men pretend to put somethin in bitches
Win when we write, the Emmy winner get hyped, off any printer
And I came to get it (HIT IT)
Like Operation PUSH, operate the tush
Black octopus of soul, in inter-planetary patrol
I planted my gold, and low and behold
It's the brother doc, ready to rock-rock
Don't stop Hobbes, I'm hot like the lumberjack chop chop
The wordsmith, I write in block letters of cursive
Curse my circus, serve this surface
And watch how the brother get over
The fly Cassanova with the frankincense odor

[Verse 3 - Percee P]
Bear witness
To where riches'll make career bitches share pictures
When the ears get this ya brains's software glitches
Splatter your brains
Leave scattered remains of matter and stains
That'll explain how you was battered and slain
I get rude and go, to your show and use your own
Fans to BOO and throw you off 'til you lose your flow
A pro, mean like Joe Greene when I blow steam
Put your whole team on pause like cold cream
Then show laughter when I flow faster, your ho have ta
Go after her weave from the breeze when I blow past ya
I'm dapper plus ghetto and just pedal
When the dust settle we left in the rubble to crush metal
Nurses with hearses sealin conversed with lit purses
Spit fire, make you first to bit, try me
Like Osama, or Dahmer', I'mma cause trauma
And homicides when I collide I get kamikaze

[Verse 4 - Big Daddy Kane]
Kane baby, walk hard, the p-jects
On streets of Brooklyn I'm a crew of D-cepts
On streets of L.A. I'm a whole E-set
On tracks with Jurassic I be the T-Rex
Still that Gucci dressin', still that coochie pressin'
My pimp game smooth be-gets 'em
I don't use discretion; cop tends to be stressin'
Fuck explainin it, who's he testin'?
Finsta perform all physical forms
Leave your ass shakin like a Mystikal song
Please Dumb, what type of shit was you on?
Cause man to compress a nigga mean One less a nigga (uh-huh)
All I want is my niggas all recruitin a slimmy
All I want is my liver all polluted with Remy
Duel with any, bring it, I face-off
Son you out your league like Jordan was with baseball

[Verse 5 - Chali 2na]
Yeahhh, your majesty, word flash photography
Third class economy, blade slashed your artery
Nerve gassed anatomy, blurred past dramatically
Herbs hashed, my word splash packed agility
Never predictability
Manouvers of mind fully designed cause I'm true to the rhyme
We do the sublime, crackin yo' backbone
Attackin you wack clones
Vernacular right and exact, capital rap zone
That come back verbal assault rifle (ahhhhh)
We fight like Stokely Carmichael
Nope! We just like you
We broke and ain't no tellin what we might do
Ain't no joke
Revoke the right to reverse to seek mercy
With the King Asiatic and Percee P
Ain't heard the worst of me, until your chest 3-D
Spit venom and burn your body like a STD

[Verse 6 - Marc 7]
Put a 20 on the next brother steppin to me wrong
I mess around a lick cause you done cheat on my theme song
This might seem wrong, but this is a mean song
Crushed like King-Kong, and just like ping-pong
Back and forth, I spit molotovs, it's time to floss
My verbal affirmation is to always go off
When syllables slide you'll be enjoyin the vibe
When consider it pride, it's J5
When another deadly medley, camera action yo we heavy
Aim steady slash machette Maserati engine ready
Good and plenty don't be petty count the fetti and we jetti
OFF to another city where we do our nitty grity
We wild like Serengeti, tear it down let's seek and set it
Get ready, for the ride, verbally hang-glide
Write and stay tight, mission's in sight
Murderer worldwide the stage is yo' knife
