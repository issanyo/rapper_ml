When you work, sometimes you sweat
And when you sweat you're gonna get wet
You're gonna get wet (OW!)

[Verse 1]
I was the one to say I get the job done
I did it and got with it, I must admit it was well fitted
A piece of the pie would be fly
Instead of a crumb for a bum, uh, I gotta get some
But I don't wanna be a secondhand, middle man
I wanna take a grandstand and
Makin' the cash flow grow
Pullin' myself outta the dirt
And a job ain't nothin' but work

[Hook 1 with various ad-libs]
WORK!
A job ain't nuthin' but work
WORK! WORK!
A job ain't nuthin' but work
WORK! WORK!

[Verse 2]
Mo' money, mo' money, mo' money
Gotta get made to get paid in this trade
And I believe that I can achieve
To make ends meet like a hair weave
Survivin' in this economy, people in the world they gotta be
Stayin' in the upper class, so you're the path
The rich gets the most and the poor gets a little
And only Monie Love can make it in the middle
I can't let life get the best of me
I gotta take, take control of my own destiny
Control what I hold and of course be the boss of myself
No one else will bring me wealth
I gotta hit them streets to make ends meet
So just bust the style of a hustler
Run a scam, 'cause damn, many people pockets get hurt
And a job ain't nuthin' but work

[Hook 2 with various ad-libs]
Workin' everyday
All the damn week
A job ain't nuthin' but work
Workin' everyday
On the subway
A job ain't nothin' but work
A job ain't nothin' but work

[Bridge]
No more workin' overtime
You get yours and I'll get mine
I won't stop at any cost
I won't stop 'til I'm the boss

[Hook 2 with various ad-libs]
Workin' everyday
All the damn week
A job ain't nuthin' but work
Workin' everyday
On the subway
A job ain't nothin' but work
A job ain't nothin' but work

[Verse 3]
Straight outta the ghetto
Not out of Beverly Hills or Flushing Meadows
Yet through, I made it this far and had to gamble, scramble, peddle
Ain't no shame in my game and I came through like a thoroughbred
But still there's more ahead
I'm not the greedy, I'm the needy seekin' a financial status
That put my pockets to be the fattest
I don't wanna be employed when times are hard
I'm so against workin' I wouldn't even take a blowjob
I'd rather do my own thing
I gotta be the one in charge to make myself live large
A J-O-B is not for me, I don't want no parts of it
So take this job and shove it

When you work, sometimes you sweat
And when you sweat you're gonna get wet
