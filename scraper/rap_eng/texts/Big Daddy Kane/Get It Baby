[Verse]
Hey little girl, hey pretty baby
I want to tell you what I'm feeling when I look at you
Weak in my knees like I'm sedated
This may sound crazy but you're all I really want to do

[Bridge]
I swear I'm only here to have fun
Now come on baby tell me what you want

Say we're really going to do it baby (Do it, do it, baby, baby)
We gonna get it tonight
We gonna get it baby

Say we're really going to do it baby (Baby, baby, do it, do it)
We gonna get it tonight
We gonna get it baby

[Chorus]
Get it baby (Get it baby)
Come on!
Get it baby (Get it baby)
Come on!
Get it baby! (Get it girl)
(Tonight we're gonna get it baby)

Get it baby (Get it baby)
Come on!
Get it baby (Get it baby)
Come on!
Get it baby! (Get it girl)
(Tonight we're gonna get it baby)

[Verse]
Hey pretty girl, my sugar baby
You make me crazy when you move your body like you do
You blow my mind - decapitated
Girl I can't wait to get you all alone - just me and you

[Bridge]
I swear I'm only here to have fun
Now come on baby tell me what you want

Say we're really going to do it baby (Do it, do it, baby, baby)
We gonna get it tonight
We gonna get it baby

Say we're really going to do it baby (Baby, baby, do it, do it)
We gonna get it tonight
We gonna get it baby

[Chorus]
Get it baby (Get it baby)
Come on!
Get it baby (Get it baby)
Come on!
Get it baby! (Get it girl)
(Tonight we're gonna get it baby)

Get it baby (Get it baby)
Come on!
Get it baby (Get it baby)
Come on!
Get it baby! (Get it girl)
(Tonight we're gonna get it baby)

[Verse: Big Daddy Kane]
Facts - you've been the coldest
And I can't describe what your inner glow is
Shaking it so that men can notice
And trust - all eyes on her when she throws it

Ain't seen it this thick since Jennifer Lopez
And I'm taking it in doses
Sitting there looking centerfoldish
Feeling me, ma? Then expose it
Girl you're not just a round-the-way THOT
What you got? Just a little too hot. I see your plot
Really though. Chick's been, video vixens
Getting low friction till the dough kicks in
But you? You get a pass
With that ....
Looking all kind of mean in designer jeans
Now, back it up like a time machine

[Bridge]
I swear I'm only here to have fun
Now come on baby tell me what you want

[Chorus]
Get it baby (Get it baby)
Come on!
Get it baby (Get it baby)
Come on!
Get it baby! (Get it girl)
(Tonight we're gonna get it baby)

Get it baby (Get it baby)
Come on!
Get it baby (Get it baby)
Come on!
Get it baby! (Get it girl)
(Tonight we're gonna get it baby)
