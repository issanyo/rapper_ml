Welcome to my secret garden, but no salad
Ain't no need to cash your ballot
Baby, all I do is win like Khaled
And I got something valid
You can put on your palette
Hot saucer of the tomato grits
The side of your booty and your minority
Looks to be like it seems Japanese
And I can tell it ain’t got no recipe
Cos’ television
Gotcha with Hell’s Kitchen
Or multi flavor grilled ham
Honey Chews lickin’
I ain't dinin’ you, I'm brinin' you
What are collards it’s  not just another
I've realized that you've played this for
To satisfy your mayonnaise cake hunger
I'm cookin' up something insatiable
You ready for a taste?
Say grace
And I'm gonna put it on your body
Like cheese on grits
Just like some cheese on grits
Can’t get enough of collard greens
