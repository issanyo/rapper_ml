Kane

[Verse 1: Joell Ortiz]
Hand me a cane, I'm back like Bruce Wayne up to bat
Verse Bane, lay you flat like Kane, half steppin'
Due to my box, who do I not make look doodoo?
Soon as I hop on the music it usually stop (um...)
Y'all gon do something to me or not?
Been here forever, poppin' shit like my booty's a Glock
Feel like I'm better than whoever you could ever put together
Leather sweater, Cali weather, yeah, I'm brutally hot
Like clippers on a garbage barber, Gaza Strip bomber
Screaming "Allahu Akbar," armageddon
War weapons are strong armour
Warm lava fallin' on ya till your forearm's a goner
I thought I forewarned ya I'm a monster
Partner, been on this mic longer than Bob Barkers
I go bonkers with the metaphor
Simile, double and triple entendres, it's been an honour
Wait, I ain't done yet
I done left put your boy lights out, call it a sunset
Ain't even get to my guns yet
I gotta young Tech that still sound like a Smith & Wesson drum set
Brrrt, blat—bla—back, no more lung breath
Coughin', coffin on top of coffins — bunkbeds
Take a nap while they play it back, the only way to rap
And get dap from Big Daddy Kane at

[Chorus: Big Daddy Kane]
'Cause I ill and kill at will
Teach 'em a skill that's real, you're no thrill
So just stand still and chill as I build
Science I drill until my rhymes fill
Your head up, don't even get up
The teacher is teaching, so just shut up

[Pre Verse Ad-Lib: Token]
Oh, oh, oh shit!

[Verse 2: Token]
My price went up
By the time I end this shit it's going twice as up
I ain't stoppin' till I'm on a pedestal Big Daddy Kane is on
And ragin' on anyone who ain't as high as us
I guess I changed us, these are smart raps
But the labels see it well
I only take the meaningful one
Really basic reason
To shake hands with presidents
Take their money out their pocket with my left 'cause I'm ambidextrous
Token is a man, remember it
Mark my words like a spanish emphasis
(Damn, who let him in?) Man is very sick
Ambulance is with cans of medicine
Can't be helpin' him, chance is lesser than
Anorexic with random presents
Big as Pamela Anderson's, then you get to
Enhance your penmanship and the question is
Can you mess with his plan just when it is
Manifested with fans who represent
Of course not
You're not really up to a whole lot
Oh God, actin' like a slow-mo robot
Tell me what control y'all
Is it money? You tryna get revenue?
Five words I never said: I'm in debt to you
You roll with contracts, I'm ownin' your ass
That's what the fineprint telling you
You don't wanna be my rival
Nobody give me a reason to be killin' every one of my idols
I'ma do anything if it's gonna be gettin' me any title
I bet they sick of me, I can tell they're sick of me when the sickness is going viral

[Chorus: Big Daddy Kane]
'Cause I ill and kill at will
Teach 'em a skill that's real, you're no thrill
So just stand still and chill as I build
Science I drill until my rhymes fill
Your head up

[Verse 3: Chris Rivers]
Pass me the mic
I cane able like Kane came able to kill Abel
So biblical, chemical flow hittin' you
Syllables blow left in you niggas that smoke
But this isn't your typical fictional
Releast shit that ever came out of you was your umbilical
Tried to battle the mythical pinnacle of rap
Pitiful, you're assed out like physicals
And even if I stuttered I would still sh-sh-shit on you
See, I can do that
Living proof that rap never died and I can prove that
Ooh, risen from the grave with the lyric in the page
Got the Chi whole city screaming, "who that, who that?"
Young, dirty nigga, but a nerd word flipper
From my first word figured that I'd burn herb niggas
Gotta learn curb flipper what you heard first stripper
Selling Plan B pills verses pervert pictures, I'm the man
Figured that quitter is filled up with liquor
My liver richer than vigor, I threw the manilla bigger 'cause I can
I'm spending Mr. Dinners I shiver shaking the winner
While my sister's out flyin' to tropics gettin' tans
Son of a stone nigga like Bam Bam
Everybody gettin' the back, nigga, like TransAm
Born psychotic, the Godmom of mob fights
Hard life, step to the plate, it's a grand slam (Rivers!)

[Chorus: Big Daddy Kane]
'Cause I ill and kill at will
Teach 'em a skill that's real, you're no thrill, so ju...*Record Scratch*

[Verse 4: Big Daddy Kane]
The God in person, leave the bitch hurtin'
Can't commence workin', prayin' for insurgence
Lyrical venom that I put in 'em
Will sentence [?] to prevent when I pen 'em you can never defend 'em
Fully gated, start to go in 'em
It's in the genes, you can call the flow denim
I breathe on tracks, lethal attack
Got it covered, ain't no need to react
When I come through I kick in the doors
The cash behind me liftin' the fours
Red fluid done tripped in the floors
So when you stop bleedin' that's when my men'll pause
Just 'stand you just can't withstand
The hit span comin' from this man listen
Y'all cats dream to expand
I'm laminated, baby, you waitin' for wristbands

[Chorus: Big Daddy Kane]
'Cause I ill and kill at will
Teach 'em a skill that's real, you're no thrill
So just stand still and chill as I bill
Science I drill until my rhymes fill
Your head up

[Verse 5: Snow Tha Product]
Oh, you want me back on that lyrical miracle type shit
You want me back where I started out with the flow
You want me back to killin' these bitches quick
As they tellin' a bitch to kick it, I'm tellin' a bitch to go
I give 'em a chance to rip it, these bitches just stand and fold
I'm takin' the seven digits they figure is decimals
I'm focused on bigger pictures, they're tripping on pixels
But ain't no one colder than Ms Snow
Man suprise me 'cause I see you comin' with no visine
I'm risin', I'm makin' it hard to eye-to-eye me
But I be predicting the move that you quite be
So why do these bitches use me, I might be
Fly as fuck or high as fuck or both
Hittin' 'em ridin' cut and jab and hook and go
You can try your luck, but I am comfortable
Because your timing's off, I'm rhymin' fast or slow
It's not impossible is it that I'm just hotter when I'm spittin'?
Fuckin' hostile when bitches don't measure up half height
Man, you gotta be kiddin' even if it was a given
That you could pivot and spend it on a shot that you could take flight
I'm a student, I learned from Pun and Em
And I'm a got damn chopper and I earned the creds
So word to Tech, I'm takin' this to earn the check
Joell, tell 'em that I'm coming 'cause your girl is next

[Chorus: Big Daddy Kane]
'Cause I ill and kill at will
Teach 'em a skill that's real, you're no thrill
So just stand still and chill as I build
Science I drill until my rhymes fill
Your head up, don't even get up
The teacher is teaching, so just shut up
