[Verse One]

I come from off the streets where you learn to do or die
And you can't say the Bed without saying the Stuy
Reputation notorious
In battle victorious
I ran through everyone of your boroughs
Just like the Warriors
Crushing my enemy
In any vicinity
It's either him or me
So I'ma make him a memory
It's not intended to be
Some sort of facsimile
But my identity
Is kinda like number twenty-three
You hope to be
One day as dope as me
But you're softer than tissue
And just as sweet as potpourri
Bring on your best and watch the way I kill a few
Mutilation
I break them up just like syllables
For any competition coming for my title
Foe or rival [?]
You better want it more than I do
You can't be half stepping when the Kane come attack
Lyrical Thundercat
You don't want none of that

[Chous]

Like that y'all
It's like that y'all
It's like that
X4

[Verse Two]

[?] A dissing for assault
[?] Battling salt with rappers
Getting Colt 44's as I bring it to a halt
That [?]gangster bullshit as I spit the hardest song
Plus, I'm born invincible just like Carter Wong
When you cross the line
I stick you like a porcupine
Anything to make sure you never fuck with mine
You'd rather be
A tragedy
A catastrophe
That has to be
Drastically
Delivered by your majesty
You can see why
You can never be fly
As me
The B-i-g D-a double d-y
Speak with a slurred sentence
From Old Gold and Guinness
Still quick to run up in your mouth just like a dentist
Sit down in groups hear my man fat cable
And kick down the doors of your fucking rap label
And put you out of business like WHT
Trying to play the Kane
What are you crazy?

[Chorus]

[Kane ad lib]
Uh-huh
Know what I'm saying?
This Big Daddy Kane
Doing the things that I do
And everything you hear is Top Shelf

[Verse Three]
I come from out the gutter
Where all of my niggas clutter
Around one another
Ripping flows [?]
The block party favorite
Who rap the craziest
Cause when it comes to the mic
I'm too amazing, kid
You looking at a lyrical rapper
That drop the gatter
That sounds fatter
Than anybody coming near or after
I stand accused
For the nig that I abuse
And [?] pop Langston Hughes
And I never plan to lose
[?] because you know how we do
[?] We know peace in the crew
Up on Lewis Avenue
I got a whole posse that's straight Bellevue
You keep faking moves
You get stuck at the LQ
Ain't no comparing ya
Evacuate the area
The stakes get scarier
I don't wanna bury ya
It's like a marathon the way you hear tracks
[?] fear facts
Niggas running out their Air Max

[Kane ad lib]
Uh uh-uh-uh-uh
To my man Cool V
Good lookin' Brooklyn
