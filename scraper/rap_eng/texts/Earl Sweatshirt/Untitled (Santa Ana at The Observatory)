What’s your motives, ho?
I only trust these bitches ‘bout as far as I can throw ‘em
Tryna pay my mama's rent, figured that’s just what I owe her
I been trouble since I tumbled out that stroller
Strolling easy down this narrow path, beefing with your scary ass
‘Preme got my little niggas cheesing off the cherry
And nigga that’s a great bunch, Papa Swamp is stomping with the skate fucks
Heavy-handing tracks until the day the fucking train comes
Raised up, when he ‘bout to speak the truth he ???
Peep the evening news, my nigga, we don’t do the same stuff
??? before I’m jogging 'round these bases
Niggas' bitches need to change
Separated from my main one
It’s just another day, another nigga's bitch got face fucked
I’ve been like this since the Motorola RAZR
What a bastard that baby was, little mad nigga miss his dad, never praying much
Right around the same time his grandmama drank a bunch
Take the bus, take a nigga’s seat like he was paying for me
I got this nigga Dash with me, he sippin’ on some make-believe
I’m only happy when it’s static in the air, ‘cause the fair weather's fake to me
Living in the scope, hairs crossed like adjacent streets
Dare  a nigga to think he sweet
Never bitches, funny, boy you berries and you honey for the bears [?]
Run a nigga's pockets like some errands, make it hasty
Hope the sheriff keep away from me
