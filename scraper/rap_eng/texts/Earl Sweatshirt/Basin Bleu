[Verse 1]
Ay
Ayo, that shit ain’t delivery it’s DiGiorno’s
More changed then Jacob Marley flaring hormones
Paranormal, Rose-Mary baby legend wallow
Catastrophic melanzano
I been having breakfast with Moscato aloe
[?] benevolent how pathetic is your cargo
I'm shipping in November, Bredrick done hit the lotto

(Sample)

[Verse 2]
Ayo, tell her why you mad cause I be fucking bitches you ain’t even fucking, busting pistols, niggas ain’t even tucking
Barely eating off it
Why the fuck you be in Neiman Marcus
Never see you leave a steaming carcass
Fucking on the beach, vegan daughters
You be fucking with police
Leaking torrents you a geek-a-saurus, sucking on the teeth
Trick-a-nosis with no [?] on it
Take a big bite of what you even nourish-ment
Pull up with 5 sticks like Wrigley's for double-mint
You draw the line, been mine squiggly
God government is on the watch list, you’re not litty
Nuh uh, you’re not litty
Twinning
I got the same time you got
Soon as you take the Tourbillon off your wrist you faking the shot [?]
You flamin' hot
I bring the mop, ooh wops
All my niggas love me, fuck I be thinking 'bout
I thinkin 'bout luau

[Chorus]
Momma told me you was soft
Now I know I should of listened to my mom
Momma told me you was green
Now I know I should of listened to my mommy

Momma told me you was soft
Now I know I should of listened to my mom
Momma told me you was green
Now I know I should of listened to my mommy

Momma told me you was soft
Now I know I should of listened to my mom
Momma told me you was green
Now I know I should of listened to my mommy

[Verse 3]
[?]
I had the muscadine Walleys, lit the mo blunt
Y'all never seen shotties lift a whole truck
Roll up
Ain’t shit shakin', but my dick hit the toilet bowl mum
British walkers water wall and swoll plums
Toes done
Gangsta party dove dominoes where I’m-
Ho hum
Niggas talking off the powdered nose, numb
So dumb
(Dumb motherfuckers)
Shoot you like Thierry for Shepard Fairey, scary
Mr. Brainwash every devil with legendary dairy (cheese)

You don’t even know
Who is your father?
A la lée-dou von, coucou son
