[Sample]

[Verse 1: Mach-Hommy]
Yo, ayo
Mach-Hommy
Spray up your building like DONDI
Juanito Alimaña on the trolley, bonfire, spin the tyres for a Barbie
Burnin’
Reciprocate the love hearty, Audrey
Hearty views use spang me later for the gory truth
Best way to get away is probably through beaucoup
Hoes choose, gangstas play us if they gators don't chew
Au jus
I take it if it makin' some glue
You gotta hydrate
Eat up the pussy like Sade
Gussy up the rookie like Bombay, we winnin’
Dimming privacy blinds in the choc' Wraith, heart-shaped
Keep grinning Hijabs in the crawl space
All safes
Geese pâté over broccolis
Causeway speed knees capped in a lacrosse game, Balmain
Vegan cheese slathered over shark steak
PSEG the Gleesh, ration up the frog legs
Keepin' you rap niggas on rami
Wallahi ain't no suhoor
I pass the pilaf pack in the lobby
Dirty gook
Asiatic spook, very loose
3.80 for respectin' [?]
Curry stew, the Curry favour with the soup
Sell drugs in front the neighbors on the stoop

[Verse 2: Heem Stogied]
Check
Niggas is talkin' practice, my shit is played around the fuckin' atlas
I flip raps like a pissy mattress
Fly as fuck, I'm sharper than a cactus
Ready to take the planet like Galactus
Worldwide two souls collide
Ain't nothin' changed commit a homicide
Heem Stogied lyrical drive-by
When I shoot everybody die
You better be ready to ask God 'why'?
When I kick this flyshit you get a cold drift
I had to learn how to move swift
Sip slow with a blunt of piff
Niggas actin' dumb the 40 on my fuckin' hip
So watch the words out your fuckin' lips
Cuz I smoke motherfucka like some rare tips
Nigga this God's gift
Thug shit and politics he demolish shit
You lame niggas copy shit, outta style like a floppy disc
Niggas be out the fuckin' mix, break your bones like a fuckin' Twix I'm tryna hit a million dollar lick
Niggas is ballin' with the flick of the wrist
Everyday a nigga take a risk
Black man in this lonely land
My niggas ready to clap like a fuckin' marching band
This pure heat, bitch I got the golden hand
The man with the master plan tryna build a bigger brand
Time will tell in this wicked land
Fake niggas get buried in the fuckin' land
I'm upset makin' these niggas dance, shoot a nigga out his fuckin' stance
I recycle like Steve Lance, I got twenty five years in my fuckin' pants
Fuck the police, them niggas can never catch me
Runnin' the game this is practice at a track meet
I'm AI, fuck a trap beat
