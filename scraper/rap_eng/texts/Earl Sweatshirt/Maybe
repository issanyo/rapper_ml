[Verse 1: Vile Murk]
Freckled face with a tight waste
And she dress nice taste
Finna ask her on a date
Wonder what she gone say
She think I'm an asshole, listening to Ab Soul
Fitting cause I ride slow
And she got holes in her jeans (eh)
And she got cuts in her sleeves (eh)
And she ride wave like Max B (eh)
I said Jesus pls (eh), I said Jesus pls (eh)
I said Jesus pls (eh), I said Jesus pls

[Hook]
Maybe we can fall in love
I said maybe we can fall in love
Maybe we can fall in love
Just maybe we can fall in love
Maybe we can fall in love
Just maybe we can fall in love
I said maybe we can fall in love
Just maybe we can fall in love
I said maybe we can fall in love

[Verse 2]
You see me and I see you
Friday night I'm on my Pilot Jones shit
Mind gone but I'm still hovering in existence
So kiss me misses
Dead ass type what he want in a guy
A gentleman but still hard when he tries
So we moving across the room
Trip on a spoon, but still hoping that we fall in love
21 jump like these angel doves
Didn't want to be seen at the club on a Wednesday
I'm only here for my friends sake
Introduce myself but I'm half faded
So I did it wrong, came off strong
That's why we don't talk
But she still wanna talk
Wait
Who's that nigga in your Snapchat story
With the filter real blurry
And now I'm bout to get gory
It coulda been me in backgrounds
Music, I'm finna snap now
Been hanging with wrong crowds
Niggas only 18
So small shit do phase me
I'm young and I'm crazy
Down streets I am skating
And I am not hating
This world I'm escaping
We haven't talked lately

[Hook]
But still maybe we can fall in love
Just maybe we can fall in love
Still maybe we can fall in love
