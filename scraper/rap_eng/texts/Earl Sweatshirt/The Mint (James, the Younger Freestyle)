No offense
But y’all don’t get grief
It’s Takes at least six months to get up out the dirt
Y’all ain’t even know what a life worth
If it  actually mean something double that
Imma show y’all what combat really mean
Mental clear as white girl who get degrees
I don’t need to do it
Y’all  need to get off deez
All these little hoes looking like fleas
All these people round me say they fuck with me
But don’t fuck with me?
What’s the functioning?
I don’t get it baby
What you say
What you wanna do
When you hit the J
Nah
Jump the rainbow real quick
Made her realize she can suck a dick
I’m gon be me
I’m a fiend see
I got get green
It’s in my system
I need to let em know
I’m like listerine
When I’m spitting shit
You need to recognize
I’m the realist g
I’m like op
Wait that is me
Need to g o
Imma b me
On my beast mode
Imma show y’all
What cold be
804 repping in the winter time
Like on 29
Y’all don’t get the line

Uh
It take at least six months to deal with grief
Get yourself up out the dirt for what it worth?
Y’all don’t really get it
Y’all didn’t learn nothing
Like you babies still in birth

What’s it worth?
Alright last verse

Put on curse this rap game if yall don’t feel me
Imma show y’all what it mean to move a building
Imma build it up from nothing
Imma saint
Imma king
Imma god
Say what you’ll say
Do what thou wilt
You cat in the hats
Play around and ain’t been up to bat
I’ve home run since a young 16 year old
Y’all see me at 25 and didn’t even know
I was bumping rocky and Rocco
All those things you don’t
Ever play in your system
You don’t bump
Nothing real
You fake as fuck
