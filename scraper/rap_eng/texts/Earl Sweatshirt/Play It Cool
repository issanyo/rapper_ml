[Hook]
On a dark night in the city
Broken eagles may fly
Play it cool, play it cool
Play it cool, play it cool, play it cool

[Verse]
I've been feeling old
I got demons on my soul when I'm writin'
The beat play the role of a seat on a bike
How I ride it, my vices repulsing me
Nice when I'm trapped in this pain ain't my wife
When the light drizzle tap on the pane, I'm inside with 'em
When the sky clear up, still inside trippin'
You can see I ain't been sleeping in my eyes, nigga
In the mirror throwing hands, I don't toss fights
I'm heavyweight, get a load of these light niggas
Looking washed online like light linen dryin'
I'm through trying with niggas
I'm gifted cause my eyes working different and
I be seeing straight through the skies at my nigga
And all I see is snakes in the eyes of these bitches
And these guys is the difference, I despise 'em
I dispose of 'em, too
I'm the trash man, you don't want trouble, dude
Dirt from the shovel on a low bubble goose
You a coyote fucking with a roadrunner, fool
I bet you know what it do
