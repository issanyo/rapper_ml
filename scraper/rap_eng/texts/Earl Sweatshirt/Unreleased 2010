[Intro]
Yeeeaaah, bitch!
Wolfgang
Sweatshirt-uh, ho!
Bitch!

[Verse 1: Earl Sweatshirt]
Pigeon workers leave the studio wall shitted-up
Shit talkin' little fuck, getcha' sista-sister fucked
Shit, I hit stripper up we gone pickin' nigga-niggas
Stick inside the fuckin' pops, worried, glue them bitches up

Rippin' writtens while my nigga splittin'-splittin' blunts
Eyes hazey wit' my middle finger up a stripper's cunt
Lights down, lit her up, sherm in my sippy cup
Ice pickin' cripples 'till I get my pickle rub

Catch me-catch me poppin' pimples tellin' bitch's triple sixes
Stab-stabbing them with pencils in their temples 'till my dick erupts
It's really fuckin' simple, slut, Wolfgang, get with us
We about to grab a FULL fista' nuts and lick 'em up

Turn it up, fisticuff, givin'-gi-givin' bitches dick to suck
Let 'em drink the cum out a fuckin'-fuckin' paper cup
Whore's wider than the horse that I'm sniffin' up
Leave now if you ain't tryin' get them titties touched
