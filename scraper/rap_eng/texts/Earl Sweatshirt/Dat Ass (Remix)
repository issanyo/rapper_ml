[Al Savage, Verse 1:]

Eat these words up and take em' with yo vitamins
Pregnant bitches gettin' crunk, throwing empty Heineken's
A game of violent FIFA, wettin' rappers up with this Oceanic spit

I let my shit flow, like gush diarrhea
Wild life patrol, I'm still searchin' for that beaver
I got her pussy wetter than two skipped rocks
And now she's filled up good, like nerd's tube socks, yo

Shit so deep that you shallow niggas drown
I'm callin' her my queen while she givin' me the crown
Now I'm smokin' on Hawaiian, because they call me Stitch
I love her like a friend, but I fuck her like a bitch

I'm rappin' like an attic, I do not plan to stop
Haters turn to bunnies, on my dick is where they hop
And, I'm killin' niggas quickly, like point blank range
Doctors said I'm too sick, I'm spittin' the Mange

Tell me that I'm bogus, I do not even flutter
I'll crack you faggots in the head and straighten up your stutter
I'll chew you niggas up, and I spit you faggots out
You're still flamin' harder than an old niggas gout, yeah

Got your mind fucked up, like the ending of Inception
I'm hear to knock you down a peg nigga no exception
Get the girlies blushin', maybe get to smushin'
I beat the beat so hard, now Mike Tyson's gushin'

[End]
