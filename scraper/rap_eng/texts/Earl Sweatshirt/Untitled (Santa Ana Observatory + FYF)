Put your hand on the case
We was jumping the fuck up like quicksand (? in my ways ?)
Was always stuck [?]
Then an ambulance came
The first time [?] Los Angeles raised
My bitch say the spliff take the soul from me
And the clique tight -knit, it's like a 'lo rugby
Beat the fucking beat up like it stole from me
You could talk to Clancy
You need to feature a quote from me
Bitch, I’m off Delancey, our regal reach getting [?]
Early running with niggas who co-running shit
(? The wind’s like lotion ?), he get ‘em, he go rub ‘em in
Critics pretend to get it, bitches just don’t fuck with him
I spent the day drinking and missing my grandmother
Just grab a glass and pour some cold white wine
And then the Colt .45, and then you know how I get it
I’m toasting myself, and a toast to all my niggas
And ain’t no time limit, I’m toasted as hell
And I gotta jot it quick, cause I can’t focus so well
