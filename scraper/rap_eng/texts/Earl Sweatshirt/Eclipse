[Chorus]
Bear arms
Take no prisoners (Yeah)
Just make more chips and work the brakes off nigga's shit
(Straight on 'em)
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse]
Say goodbye to my openness, total eclipse
Of my shine that I've grown to miss when holding shit in
Open my lids, my eyes said my soul is amiss (Soul is)
The signs say we close to the end (Close)
My mindstate sober, I'm bent
Over the pit, pokin' the flames
Hopin' I don't total my shit, that's me though
Play the game no cheat code
Had to dish 'em a free throw
Ya mouth runnin' when you depose (Facts)
Facts, it's rugged on the peak
Don't stumble, serve culinary treats, bro (Please)
The herd hungry, gotta eat (Woah)
Why its so muddy in the creek, poet?
Threes foes coming by the fleet (Bro)
Keep low, peace, preach it
Ain't so sunny by the motherfuckin' beach
The say so, gonna phone number on the screen (Ah)
Keep low, can't nobody see me sleep
I make more money on my motherfuckin' feet
Yeah, uh (Straight on 'em)

[Refrain]
We take no prisoners
Just make more chips and work the brakes off nigga's shit
(Bear arms)
Take no prisoners
Just make more chips and work the brakes off nigga's shit
(Straight on 'em)
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Outro]
Say goodbye to my openness, total eclipse
Of my shine that I've grown to miss when holding shit in
Open my lids, my eyes said my soul is amiss (Soul is amiss)
The signs say we close to the end (Close to the end)
