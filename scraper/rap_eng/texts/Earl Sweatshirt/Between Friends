[Verse 1: Earl Sweatshirt]
First off, I'ma start charging y'all per compliment
You give to me, see how much purse I can earn off of it
As far as bars, you heard wrong if you heard continent
It's incontinence, inconsequent turned sponsorin'
Rockin' a fur smock with some RC and
Go from rockin' a beat to just curb stomping it
Serve consonants hotter than hot combs
And surfin through brown permanent germs that'll jump off of it
Hot dogging with no condiments
Flow proper this show stopper be Bogarting it
Other niggas be going hard, and Early be going artisan
And lick fo' shot of the focus, more talkative
Too talkative, let the robbers in

[Verse 2: Earl Sweatshirt]
Off a couple Sake shots
Watching pot grow in short shorts and some soggy Crocs
Shoddy lot of black faces trading body shots
For all of the belongings in your pocket, park it
Hardly not, gnarly tots, nollie pops
Use a bit, it got me; then she buzzin' like a walkie talk
Staying gold like the only watch that Lonny rocks
Grimy socks, you know you don't wanna play with Papa Swamp

[Verse 3: Captain Murphy]
So unorthodox
Chillin' with a shaman, eating ramen in a parking lot
I brought a bag of dreams with me, breathe the kundalini in
Exhale the meaning and the feeling of Elysium
Even the reason leavin' 'em lost, lyrical boss, harder than most
So kill me, martyrs at most my Holy ghost
Host a party in 'em, I brought my unruly souven-
Here on her blouse like a "Yours Truly" steel pin
Ether (Ha ha ha); they can't get past the deep voice
Conceived in a Rolls Royce, abortion life, pro choice
Goth hop, put a beanie on pitch bent like a leanin' song
Learn to fly and high at the first sign that I'm dreamin' on
The Force is strong with this one though
Over 9,000 midi-chlorians say so
Really show no mercy, all master, no Percy
Show these little bastards in the journeys of my troubled mind
Saddled by your blasphemy, look at what you found inside now
You can't imagine me, running high the casualty and fucking die
This is why we had to bring the guns out
Rattled neighbors' windows every night until the sun's out
Two dudes, two odd crews with strange leaders
Kitty cats, a couple blunts, my nigga, Wangfeeder
