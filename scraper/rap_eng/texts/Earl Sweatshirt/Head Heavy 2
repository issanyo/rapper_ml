Ay, I'm in the muthafuckin house like
A baby with its mouth wide
I'mma break the ground wide open
Lay it down
I'm overlooking town, now I'm smoking
5-0 can send them hounds
I'm pitching off the mound, struck him out
Pissed 'cause I missed him
I'm so vindictive
If the check right, I'ma go the distance
You give me two dice, I'm rolling them shits
Your boy live two lifes at home with a spliff
I'm roasting it
Other half I spent homeless on the road with a spliff
So coast to my shit
Toast to my wits when I'm gone wit em
Trimming the hedge, cobra don't live in my yard
Close to the edge, no holster the blick in my palm
I'm watching my step and holding my head
For home where the hopelessness sit
All of them roaches when you open your fridge
It's in your bones, it's what show in your ribs
Only if you're strong you resist
I'm groping my pen-stroke to fit the globe in my lens
I owned up to shit I know that I did
I hope this motion bring me close to content
My head heavy, I be over this shit
Death-ready, letting go of my cliff
Hoe, you know it's the end
