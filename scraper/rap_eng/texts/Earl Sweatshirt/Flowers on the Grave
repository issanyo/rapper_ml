[Verse 1]
Been breaking bread with my niggas
But we ain't praying
I see 'em laughing and joking
But he ain't saying shit
I think he know who just dropped him
But he ain't saying shit
He ain't saying, he ain't saying

[Hook]
Fired up, fired up
You won't live to see the night
See the reaper in my eyes
I'm a demon in diguise
Fired up
Bodies and remains
Flowers on the curb, flowers on the grave
You got me fucked up

[Verse 2]
Fucking with them niggas
Your momma told you stay up in the crib but you ain't listen
You gon' get fucked up
Pay attention, and play to win it boy
This ain't no [?] with me

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
And all that fucking screaming
Make it easier to find you
Swear that I'm the leader
Tell the sheep to get behind me
I don't carry heat but it's the people that's beside me
That I can't fucking speak for, if you feel the need to try me
Ain't been sleeping, you can see it in my eyes
But I've been drinking you can see it how I'm driving
I ain't been sleeping, you can see it in my eyes
But I've been drinking you can see it how I'm driving
Don't wanna be the reason that these grieving mothers crying
But I put that behind me, be careful who you trying
We don't mind the violence, we creeping tis' the season
That the blood and guts behind them
Flames and dust behind us
