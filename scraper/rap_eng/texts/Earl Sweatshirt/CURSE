And I just went cold turkey on my bitch
It's a cold world been serving niggas since
No mercy just lurking by the fence
Ed Murphy Raw, Persian floor, pigs in the fog
Dogs coming to search the car, that's ironic cause
Every verse just serve the purpose of a service dog
To these blind niggas, redefine what you heard before
How every word got the urgency of nurses
On the tele with the surgeon, had a belly full of bourbon
'Til I remembered I'm worth it, still exempt from the curses
Still a couple shoulders over y'all
And life's short but the totem tall
I told you that the flow would circle, bring it back
I get inertia, then I murk it all
What's the topic of conversation? What's the protocol?
I keep my toe from out the serpent's yard
Listen, I don't know who hurt you Ma
What I know is living in the past just hurt you more
And now I'm grown, I'm tryna bag 'em like the grocery store
A lot of niggas poultry, I see chicken and I roast it all
A nigga living in the moment, no remarks, just a question
"Why you looking for some innocence you know you lost?"
Now you running, pissing, spitting like it's motorcross
Should the sunset, got the city golden
Plus my son said I'm the city golden boy
I've pissed and spit on my opponent
Then I'm pitchin' bodies overboard
And then I'm shaking off them shackles
I be in the house sometimes, I own my masters
Catch me on the couch unwinding
If she throw the cat, I'll smash it out the linen
Off a pack that my Uncle Al provide me
Eyes on low rider, back to business man
They low-fi so don't mind 'em
Farmin' for they cheese not they co-signing
And knock 'em out they motherfucking socks when you clothes-line 'em
Not tryna change the game, don't sign him
Motherfucker
