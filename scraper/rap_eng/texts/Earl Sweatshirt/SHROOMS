[Verse]
My nigga say he miss them older days
But I ain't known to break or fold the shape
I know the stakes and I know my place
I mow the grass so I know the snakes out for cash
I'm just watching rats while they watching cheese
And I watch the hogs while they watching me
I'm watching rats while they watching cheese
And watch the hogs while they watching me
Don't fucking talk to me, please don't fucking talk to me, dog
It's not space between this rock and this hard place
I be caught between all day, I hear foot steps in the hallway
I hear sleep's cousin at arm's length, I don't sleep
It's no sheep for me to count in the farm land, but dro cheap
Turned 21 and said peace to my bo-peep
But my flow still on stove heat, stroll through the old street
Stoned, crack a cold one for my dead and gone ones
Got strong lungs, might mug but it's all love
Nigga lost weight, so I use both paws when I grub
Cross state for the fucking check, like a old nigga prostate
Run it up, moms think I'm ducking her, I got a girl, half the time
I just think I'm falling out of love with her, it's fucked up
Other half the time, hammer time, I'm tryna fuck something
Nothin' to discuss, you could trust
I won't pick up, tryna hit me 'bout a plus one
Stomach full off of eating other niggas' lunch up
Stuck in the middle of the wolves and they issues
Everybody got they fronts up
Run some credentials like you're Forrest Gump

[Refrain]
It's a stick up, don't get punched up my nigga
When they jump out the pick up don't get jumped
It's a stick up, don't get punched up my nigga
When they jump out the -

[Outro]
I don't front, cause I front-line, not the dumb kind neither
I don't like people, still ducking one time cause I like grieving
The shroom make my eye tear up
The truth makes my sky clear up
The shroom make my eye tear up
The truth makes my sky clear up
