Dumpmeister
Energy level 8 sideways

[Verse 1: Mach-Hommy]
Yo
See the smoke, the shore play for more bread
Emaciated faces get force fed
Not Mr. Cartoon, the Nike Cortez
The John Milton, Eddie Barzoon but not the barbershop quartet
Dawg a nasta break ya rast soft-let
Lord Voorhees, you lease a turtle face, ass was pawgy
We coast the water ASAP, fly anglers attracted more eats
More sweets, chic floor seats
Amazing art of war story
I’m crazy hood, my wave is more lofty
Lordy
I make it bitter down since snowman with raw Mulberry
Mixed the Bil-Jac
Sprinkle turkey necks and implement the heel tap
My innocence was lifted with the real rap
Feel that

[Chorus: JuJu Gotti]x5
Daylight
Out of time
Gimme mine
Hammer-time

[Bridge: Mach-Hommy]
You a hoe
You a hoe ass nigga
You know what it is
You already know what it is
All you had to do was be like
“Yo Mach I did it for the um, for the- for the social media metrics”

[Verse 2: Mach-Hommy]
I said don’t put your fucking name in the hat
Unless you want your name drawn
Your confidence is on a plate dog, stay sauced
Steak sauce
Pull out that TTFN, finessin'
The bower video killed the radio star, but now I’m out the West End
Dick in your mouth was taught a lesson
The 5th will hit you like you pistol raw and now you vibing off of FN, bless him
The conniver was judgin’
Yeah yeah, we ran through the crowd
And posted on the clout with amazon perfection
My salad drowned in dressin’
Get hammered down in the jiff, you screw around
You wearing armour that thin
I got the powder for the barber fresh trim
Crest skin amazing how fast the Nautilus S spin
Connection
