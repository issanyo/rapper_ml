[Verse l]
Welcome to rock bottom
Lower then picking cotton
Lower then the bodies rotting down six feet under
Hear the thunder see the lightning
There's Angels and demons fighting
Everyday  the clash of the titans
Is you running or hiding
Use to hear the heat and get frightened
Now I don't even flinch
They Clapped my guardian angels
Left him down in a ditch
My hope was hanging by a thread that turned into lynch
Lost my grip was hanging on by a pinch
Ain't life the dirtiest trick
Just the dirtiest game
Protect yo neck Or get slain for that chain
Some men will kill if it means they can gain
Don't give a fuck bout the pain
Willing to live the rest  they life with that stain
Take that shit to the grave
Crazy how we still just a slave to chain
Pinned up with child like rage
Landmines and grenades
Just waiting to blow up away
Everyday exactly the same
