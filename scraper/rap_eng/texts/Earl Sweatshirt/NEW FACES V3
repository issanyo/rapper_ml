[Verse 1: Mugz]
Seems like before the ice, people ain't as nice
Rats try to give dap, men don't move with mice
I seen it twice, people switch when I improved
It seems progress just isn't approved
Unless you bring em with you give em handouts
You ain't pay for stu time, write rhymes or standout
So what I owe occasional bros that move like hoes
That wanna spoil in my riches and rock my gold
But couldn't make it to a show in a hole in the wall
But want VIP backstage tickets when the crowd isn't small
New faces came with some new faces that's unknown
You can keep the fake infused with hate leave me alone
In a room with some tunes and blunt just to vibe
Hugs was limited now she wanna be my bride
Well aren't I the same guy from freshman year
With the aero sweater and cornrows in hair

[Hook: Mugz]
I've been drownin' with this shallow soul
Shallow soul, shallow soul
You are drinkin' from a shallow soul
Shallow soul, shallow soul

[Verse 2:Mugz]
She luv me she luvs me not
Without a car in the lot or a big ol knot
Of cash in my pocket she's real
She will luv me before the deal
When I'm down and out she gon be my blunt
No gold in my mouth she gon be my fronts
She gon last more than months, we got years
She gon shoot my fears and catch my tears
That's music the only familiar face
The only place that gets me through the days
Through the pain, through the change
My umbrella through the rain
The only thing in my life that stayed the same
It's a damn shame when I feel like this I'm the blame
Cause I'm a sucker, believing you would luv me
That would be lovely but I'm here off a pill drinking bluntly

[Verse 3: Earl Sweatshirt]
In '09, we were still on the bus, nigga
Before Nak was deluxe, when I didn't have a brush
When it still wasn't hoes tryna fuck with me '
Fore I cleaned up a bit like it's company comin'
I ain't know we were on the cusp of the money
Tryna get a few bucks under custody
And my twin brothers was all Syd's brothers
So my kin gully and my skin toughened
And thick lens coverin' my eyes now
They ain't bright, nigga, I'm just high now
And if this a different way to clear my mind out
I need to find out, I'm doing fine now
And I don't look as stupid when I talk now
And everybody at the show look astounded
And posted up drowsy In the cut so much that it's pus 'round me Catch him in the daytime or dusk hours
Smokin' out the pound, houndin' mutts out it
If your tucks lousy then you can't sit with us (nah)
Can't call it harsh livin' when the margin
Between you and all these fuck niggas
Is about as large as it gets
And you workin', givin' arm and a leg
Say he workin' but he just talkin' cause he ain't workin'
Like a long distance bitch
Who you know that's out that's harder than this?
Chargin' niggas like a Tomlison win, nigga
Slight frown on the brow on the brim, color brown
Runnin' wild on the route that was picked
When the clouds branch out
And I'm out with my face in the shallow, drownin' again

[Hook: Mac Miller]
I've been drownin' with this shallow soul
Shallow soul, shallow soul
You are drinkin' from a shallow soul
Shallow soul, shallow soul

[Verse 4: Da$H]
Drugs got me feelin' like Vigo Carpathian
Just look at the state he's in... yo, yo
The most critically acclaimed, slang contortionist
That ain't suckin' corporate dick
Said it with my balls in grip
Other hand got a cork to hit
All this Ralph be the sportsmanship
Walked in and said I needed all the chips
As well as the one on my shoulder
Feel like my heart got pneumonia, blunt laced, covered in odor Cops still lockin' niggas up for quotas
Brain still numb from the shit in the soda, so
A generation lost Facin' a port out in vacant loft
Warrants bein' filed for the cases fought
And them drugs get obtained by debatin' cost
You ain't Superman while that cape was off
Just Clark, nigga, sittin' in his high rise
Tryna see the bright side of life
And a nigga just keep comin' back with a dark picture
It's like hard liquor, and see people are books
So you judge a mothafucka by the first page
And a bitch by the back cover
The crime is long-sleeved, so the tats covered
Real ones, I'm the last brother, when they see me on stage They said my shit was so insane
It was like Cobain hit his last number, mothafucka

[Hook: Mac Miller]
I've been drownin' with this shallow soul
Shallow soul, shallow soul
You are drinkin' from a shallow soul
Shallow soul, shallow soul

[Verse 5: Mac Miller]
Well, isn't he dizzy off the up's and down's Got a little Whitney, put it in a blunt for now She was supposed to get me high Why the fuck I wanna die now? And I'm strung out on this dusty couch In a big white ugly house, I told the bitch slow down Stop runnin' your mouth You holdin' my money, just shut up and count My right nostril hasn't worked in a week Plus the plug got work, like he servin' for a sheep Me, I'm swervin' in the Jeep Burnin' weed, doin' circles in the street How I'm playin' my shit'll wake a baby up I get her faded, put her back in the labia All my life I've been afraid of powder All my life I've been afraid of power, where did all that go? The wrong decision always called my phone Last supper I was fuckin' with the Corleones I need somethin' stronger than a cortisone That can save me from the war unknown Shoutout to Soulo (SOUL!) and rest in peace Alori Joh The devil on the other side of the glory hole Any time, any place, you could bet I'ma eat Cause my hand on the fork and the fork in the road Look at all these new faces I see, I see, I see They're comin' on the plane but they're leavin' in suitcases Been a criminal before scales were digital Used the put the weed in the sole of my blue Asics Hate myself up to strangers But the raps are just way too flagrant, so Here I go, here I go Throwin' up a prayer, it's a Hail Mary I've never been religious But I feel like the scripture's got it all there It's not just gypsies and fairies This could be my last breath, I'ma take my time Cause I'ma go out the same way I came in Right by the pussy with nothin' on my mind

[Outro: Mac Miller]
You are standing in the shallow soul You are speaking with the shallow soul Shallow soul I've been drowning with this shallow soul Shallow soul, shallow soul You are drinking from a shallow soul Shallow soul, shallow soul (fades)
