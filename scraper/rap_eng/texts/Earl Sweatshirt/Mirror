[Intro]
Stand, when you're down, understand
You got to reach out to Je-
Wait a minute, wait a minute
Wait a min', wait, now let me get a word in, sometime
Don't talk so damn much

[Chorus: Earl Sweatshirt]
And what do I see?
Only the nigga I wanted to be
When I was in rehab like, "Momma, you see now?"
Who's fucking with me? Who want it with me?

[Verse: Earl Sweatshirt]
From the side of the gate where they liable to hate you
Despite how they praise in your face, I'ma make do
Split the cake down the middle when I cut it
Quickly split it with my brothers and no bitches, we don't love 'em
High and level-headed, so I'm treaded when the tire switch
Self-medic always too restless to let the time tick
Hit the door when it hit seven
Big Thebe, thick-headed, the ink in my pen heavy
Default friendly, but shit can get number ten, Messi
We cop Henny, you grab a bench and you warm it up
21 'fore I step myself and my horses up
Devil at the front door claiming he want war
The hedges is burning up
See, where we from, we ain't learn to run
Unless we was in pack formation
Sharper than a hacksaw, drinking, smoking Backwoods
Team on my back like that JanSport, baby
Grown women, feel him, lot of grown men hating
Off the strength of appearance and a rap vocation

[Chorus: Earl Sweatshirt]
Look in the mirror and what do I see?
Only the nigga I wanted to be
When I was in rehab like, "Momma, you see now?"
Who's fucking with me? Who want it with me?
Look in the mirror and what do I see?
Only the nigga I wanted to be
When I was in rehab like, "Momma, you see now?"
Who's fucking with me? Who want it with me?
Quit fucking with me
