[Earl Sweatshirt]
I be like fuck it, dirty like rain water in a bucket
Tough tit, know the flow fucking up a cut quick

[Mike G]
Luck hit, so I'm rolling with six niggas and six women
That keep sinning like they on they thug shit

[Earl Sweatshirt]
Shit and they suck dick swift, I'ma bust quick
Miss, can I fuck tits? shit let me just quick

[Mike G]
I can't make it up, change your mood, don't get discouraged
Keep the news to yourself, I report it like Katie Couric

[Earl Sweatshirt & Mike G]
Or Connie Chung, Grab the gun, if I shoot it you prolly run
Live from the block, it's the neighborhood Nazi
From the future that's odd
Prolly getting dome from hotty nuns
Never call cause they snotty bums and they prolly cunts

[Mike G]
I'm Mike, I'm really sick, he's Sly, he kinda slick
Took your bitch, kind of thick, to lose is not a pick or option
Told Tito I'll Jackson and pop for fun
Stay down 'til the shots are done
Bitch

[Outro: Left Brain]
Dawg, tired man
We in the studio all day
Studio runs nigga
Exhausted, It's Odd Future shit, man
Just gotta do it
