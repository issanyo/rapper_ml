[Verse 1: Denmark Vessey]
Yo, cartoon shorts can't foil me, Acme hammer oil me
Walkin' like accordions, victimless sequoia trees
Sucker can keep the cow we want the three magic goya beans
You love the style, you need to practice brand loyalty
Gloatin' and flowin' is the art of flamboyancy
Catch a forty winks, Ya ain't think the boy can read
Bet this agua with a chochla pot boil your leaves
I rap like I sweat out ayahuasca water b
Yo, get the fuck off my front lawn 'fore I call the police
My policy was staff, Steve Harvey don't fuckin' talk to me
You don't like it, talk to the stache, that's my loyal trick
He graduated top of the class
He had a city fill the mud hole while stompin' yo ass with citizen tax money (You getting robbed!)
That shit should went to the kids
You taking money from the babies, man
I don't respect that

[Chorus]
Take the southpaw for granted getting rocked to sleep
Take the southpaw for granted getting rocked to sleep
You gettin' rocked

[Verse 2: Denmark Vessey]
Yeah it's stupid
Got mono, break your legs off
This counterfeit money phone making prank calls
Yeah it's stupid, hand to God, break your glass beak
My hard head make a soft pair of ass-cheeks
It was all good, but homie that was last-week
I pen the rap-sheet, this murder on the docket
Watch a billionaire pocket, watch me
This full moon harvest lead a servant on the choppin' block
You rappers looking Haagen Dazs sweet
Anybody feeling pollywoggly?
I smooth slide up outta sun deep
Little mamma got a Coke bottle body full of molotov
Thirty back to back texts
Baby we gotta speak, it's just excessive
I mean, what the f**k, yo?
Baby, listen, I gotta-
I don't have no problem with you loving (fucking) me
But you gotta stop buggin' me
I'm a fan of what she handling
Petite, more than man
It's while I'm straddling the cordle business, channelling the sewer show
Have a seat, brandishing the sword
My swing hit the earth like rock frackin', make the Gaia queef
I hit the bottom of the P and I sleep, sleep

[Bridge]
Take the southpaw for granted getting rocked to sleep
You get rocked!

[Verse 3: Adad]
My girl hardly ever ate on dick
Fuck the bacon, egg, cheese grits
Whether wake, take her hair, stick a tip
Why you in the atmosphere, feeling clouds some cinder bricks
Tryin' to make my heaven fall, talkin' shit, spittin' piss
I hate y'all dick-bag nut-boys
No like, no lipo left, no right, green light
Go, Drop me in the fast lane
Stop me when my pockets poke
I'm gon' get my mamma glue
Put it on her broken hope
Fresh up out the yoga class
Open with some broken hoes
Tryna get my chakras vibrating
All red on the mood ring
Dookie on my shoe strings
Waiting through the- waiting through the-
Waiting through the everyday
Thumbin' through the lesson plan
Lookin' for a better way to creep it with the sleeping sheep
Thinkin' if I only prayed (fuck that shit)
We in three dimensions
Breathe the air, bleeding blood
Makin' babies for the killin'

[Verse 4: Denmark Vessey]
Oh, they gon' put murder on the docket, word
Listen, I got a good lawyer
His name got a -berg in it
We win and hit the earth like like copper black
Man, she'll lift the skirt
I lit the verse like a loud pack of Grandpapa Smurf purp
Caress your lamp, finesse a genie on the third wish
Guess what Goofy?
We askin' for more wishes
Now get the granted-

[Chorus]
Take the southpaw for granted getting rocked to sleep
Take the southpaw for granted getting rocked to sleep
You get rocked!

[Outro: ???]
And I don't wanna get too deep, here
But in the process now of transition
And, son
That's why they tell you, there's nothing new under a sun
When a planet reaches a certain stage of vibration, it becomes a sun
We don't even understand what a sun is, that's another whole thing
Sun's not hot
The sun's not bright
Now, I'm soundin' I'm outta my mind, no
I'm in my mind, I'm outta my brain
Because, I'm expandin' consciousness
That's what everybody's got to do, now
