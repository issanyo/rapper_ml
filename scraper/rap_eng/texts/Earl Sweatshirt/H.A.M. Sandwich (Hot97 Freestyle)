Y'all niggas don't know me
A, B, C, 1, 2, 3, AK-47 hit a nigga in his teeth
He be talking lotta shit but ain't wanna be handlin' the mother fuckin' business that he need to
If a nigga got a problem I'mma hit a nigga in his fucking back when I see you
Fuji Water, Fuji Water, I'mma go and piss on my daughter
You don't believe me? I'mma maul her
