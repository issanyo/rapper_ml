[Verse l]
Miss her like a second sister
What is  give for sixty seconds with her
I just to tell her that I love her like no other
And they ain't no replacement
Never find another
Just  be running  chasing pavement
And you know I
Canâ€™t stay on the straighten arrow tripping over my feet
Stuck adjacent  standing waiting at the end of the street
Too fucked up to focus i can barely stay on this beat
Been up all night can't fight this feeling and i can't fall asleep
Just
Walking into walls
These
Days rather withdrawn
Like i'm going through withdrawals
Ever since the day you've gone
Been lost
Don't really feel shit
Guess its too much to deal with
Wonder what you went through
Wish I could've been there for you
You know I would've
If I could
Never thought I could've missed you this much
I'm out of touch like
Fuck

[Verse ll]
Tears in my eyes writing this
Been fighting this
Like I use to fight off me demons
In my bedroom  screaming
Dreaming of not being alone
You could made me feel at home
Even just talking on the phone
And I can feel it in my bones
Feel it in my soul
Feel it in my heart
Tearing me apart
Tearing me to pieces
Because you deceased and I'm speechless
Disillusioned seeing illusions thought it was you in the hallway
In the park way in the drive in
At the drive through
Swear I saw you
I swear I saw you
And that's how I know I'm losing my mind
Hate myself cause i know I can't make up for lost time
Just wish I had more time

[Verse lll]
Miss her like a second sister
What I'd give for sixty seconds with her
Just to kick it for a minute with my favorite cynic
Buy you I drink or two
Or three or four of five
Would buy the bar just to see you alive
To feel the vibe
Your Subtle nihilism
Lack of religion
Lack of fucks given
I'm missing I'm missing you
Wish you were next to me
Shit or at least texting ms
Can't find solace
Just feel soulless in these moments
This winters been the coldest
Ran out of hope I'm past hopeless
Feeling nauseous exhausted
This nausea has got me feeling off it
Ever since you left ive been depressed
Can't get this feeling off my chest
Can't get no rest a mess for less of a better word
Still can't accept the truth
Still can't cut this noose
I'm still
