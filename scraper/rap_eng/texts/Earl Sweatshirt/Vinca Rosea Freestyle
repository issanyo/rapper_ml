Hold up, hey now, the beast in me
Is no longer sleeping, it wants to eat MC's
So I let 'em free, let 'em feed peacefully
Until he cease, now a beast must drop feces
But I never let it free fall, I catch it and spit it
I kick shit that blows whole districts into tidbits
With pen in fist, I take tallys, of these scrimmages
Can't call it game, my juego wicked as witches is
The kid spits fuego sicker than syphilis
So sister and brothers grab a shovel start digging this
Matter fact, grab a Nikon and picture this
An icon with no assistance and no assist in this
Reminisce the number one plus twenty three
My days are sunny with steeze sweeter than honey bees
Waters are muddy, I'm cunning running from nothing be
Now I'm fucking muffin mothafuckas ain't touch me
