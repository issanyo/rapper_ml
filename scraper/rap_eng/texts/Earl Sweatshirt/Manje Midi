[Verse 1]
Ayo, the porte-coch√®re was vacant, sacred
The house was on the hillside
The Shabbos goy was on a hundred acres, all it take is patience
My slime was on the inside
I was on the corner securing cake mix, sulfuric facelift
My eye was on the big prize
I was brought up not to salute the fake shit
Baba ghanoush the waitlist

[Bridge]
No, I'm not fucking waiting nigga
Yo, foot on all that RSVP shit man
This Mach Hommy, you got me fucked up
I ain't waiting outside

[Verse 2]
Master the shadowless kick
The derringer was on the jit
Two-Hunnid-Eighty characters
I bet you all the bitches on the dick (pssh)
Twit, what you thought was a yacht a skiff, you fish
Clip longer than the list on the line at LIV
I stick the shit bonkers in your rib, I'm Allah the kid
The young go
A hunnid-one dips in the conzo
Gunsmoke
N'ap boule faire sentir bon
Pour faire manger a ma Chere, figure fronto
Yo once the chocolate in the air, then it's a donzo (uh-huh)
(Buratatatata! No! Brrt go, go!)
Ease up

[Verse 3]
Ayo, some Antimeridian cats who cough hairball
(Haitian Creole)
Spin fishes with nets, you bumbaclot nah have spare parts (huh?)
You macarena, wave god
Navajos dance for the rainfall
It cost an arm and the leg to 'scape the Babylon headlock
To take the pump and dime bags and marathon
Could leave the pumping gas inside the Benz drop
