[Intro: Lucki]
This is a high quality film, right?
Aye, ooh
Ooh, aye, aye, aye
Tell that bitch I miss it more from a distance
Ooh, keep it away, aye, aye
Keep it away, keep it away, keep it away
Keep it away, aye
Keep it a-, uh, woah
Aye, aye, aye
Tell that bitch I miss it more from a distance

[Verse 1: Lucki]
Tell that bitch I miss it more from a distance
I got codeine in my pores, I can’t kick shit, aye
Under 30, I got Forbes in my wish list, aye
Leave my faith all up to Lord, I won’t kick shit, aye
I was in school, nodding off, I'm a misfit, aye
All them cosigns nigga still did nothing with it, aye
That lil hoe will do me wrong, what make you different
This Max Payne world, Percocet my vision, aye
What is pain, world, I wish I could feel this, aye
This the same hoe, molly love her different, aye
I didn’t change, nope, I’m still with my misfits, aye
In the same boat, our waters just different, aye
I’m the same dummy, you everything you isn’t
How do you go home, don’t know who you came with
It ain’t talking my money longer, I lose and get it
I love her, I don’t condone her, she really with it
Wock sipper, but I’m alone, now I see it different
Wock sipper, but I’m alone, now I see it different
Wock sipper, but I’m alone, now I see it different
