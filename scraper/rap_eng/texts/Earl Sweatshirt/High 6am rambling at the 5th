Bottom of a rocket hot as tamale, ganja lit
Squad legit, armored whips
Roll call, state your name, sweatshirt
See 'em flex tweeted, vexed, seeded
Engaging my ex-demons
Evading arrest, speeding straight into the next precinct
I'm making a mess, leave it, I can't breathe
Floating off the best product, get money and dress awful
I'm holding a press conference, address nonsense
Nigga, slanging wood like a deck sponsor
Now piss off bitch, no off switch
Been hard since, since Pippen been pimping
Let's go and fix the exposure so you can picture me rolling
And dump the clips on a poser
Or slangin' bricks in a holster that hold the 5th is emotional
And it cry and it's sobbing now and it's raining all over you
I guess the chickens just came home to roost
Pigs fly every day, couple 100 on the hay sack
Blunted in the way back, fuck you and your lame tats
What I want, I take that what I want, I take that
What I want, I take that, talk and get them grapes smashed
