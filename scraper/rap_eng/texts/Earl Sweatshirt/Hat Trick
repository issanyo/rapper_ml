[Verse 1: Earl Sweatshirt]
Uh, uh
Give until I can't give
I lend a hand if it's needed
But these stabs got me bleeding out my back, kid
Keep it on the fumble, we could sack shit
Hat trick, we consider Mulligan's for that shit
The proof is in the pudding and the pamphlets
The sewer and the mattress, stupid nigga, you could get it
Get it, only thing certain was the taxes
Burn me when the journey ends
Clergyman, turn me into ashes
I move surgically, new sermon for the masses
We too purpose for the scrap
What the verdict read is that courtesy of shit circumstances
The earth is my turf but the hearse like a magnet
I'll be outside in some handcuffs, might be outside in the dirt, uh
Gentrified, got your turf getting hacked up
Late nights, thinking 'bout who lied to me first
Grave, ooh, hoo, hoo, fuck it
Run me back, nigga (fuck it)
Yeah, that shit is hard, we gotta run it back (run me back, nigga)
Detroit, make some noise for human error

[Verse 2: Earl Sweatshirt]
I said that
I give until I can't give
I lend a hand if it's needed
But these stabs got me bleeding out my back, kid
Keep it on the fumble, we could sack shit
Hat trick, we considered Mulligan's for that shit
The proof is in the pudding and the pamphlets
The sewer and the mattress, stupid nigga, you could get it
Get it, only thing certain is these taxes
Burn me when the journey ends
Clergyman, turn me into ashes
I move surgically, with new sermons for the masses
We too purpose for the scraps
What the verdict read, is that courtesy of shit circumstances
The earth is my turf but the hearse like a magnet
I'll be outside in some handcuffs, might be outside in the dirt, uh
Gentrified, got your turf getting hacked up
Late nights, thinking 'bout who lied to me first
Graveyard energy, tied to the job
Based off principle, my energy
Printed with my face all twisted
It's the artist at work
Greyhound tickets and some haze on my missus
Though, it make no sense, I keep a heart on my shirt
When the rain storm's vicious, spend the day blowing, drinking
Trying to harvest the hurt, but it make no difference
God damn
