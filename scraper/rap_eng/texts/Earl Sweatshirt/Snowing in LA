[Verse 1]
"Just wanna come to L.A"
I'm like, "Nah, I'm finna leave, I'm finna go to The Bay"
She like, 25th letter
"Why can't we get together? Plus, I love the weather"
Oh-

[Hook]

It's snowing in L.A right now baby (Snowing, it's snowing)
It's flooding in L.A right now baby (It's flooding, it's flooding)
It's wild bears in L.A right now baby (Attacking, they're attacking)
And Ralphie Alsadek is a goddamn liar

[Verse 1 continued]
That nigga said it never rains
I got a bald head, nigga got a heavy chain
I got my nose in the air boolin' heavy pot
I got one eye on the dollar, my doggy Fetty Wap
I got a half hour to burn some heady pot
Hairband banging 2pac, nigga KRS
Got bats and chains and the bayonets
Diamond low, diamond low
Take the bangers in the BritishBins
It's post-Laugh Factory, Kramer don't tickle me
Y'all [?] you [?] and some chicken wings
More rain-o, por favor, nigga please
We was sipping lean 'fore they sipped the lean
Then it was diamond tap-tap
Baby 'membering face-ass
Can't sip the tap, 'cause it ain't clean face-ass
Plant fluoride, arm leg leg arm
Hard heavy EBT card, S is flexing up in Hollywood Hills
I don't know you N-words, don't call my line
Talking that, "Y'all done swear-"
Get the fuck outta here
Talking 'bout, "Don't just like, bro you gotta share"
25th letter
F-T-R-F-Y-O record
Yeah it's always sunny and they feel you in the west

I made it wet in Los Angeles baby
I made it wet in Los Angeles baby

[Hook]
It's snowing in L.A right now baby (Snowing, it's snowing)
It's flooding in L.A right now baby (It's flooding, it's flooding)
It's wild bears in L.A right now baby (Attacking, they're attacking)
And Ralphie Alsadek is a goddamn liar
It's snowing in L.A right now baby (Snowing, it's snowing)
It's flooding in L.A right now baby (It's flooding, it's flooding)
It's wild bears in L.A right now baby (Attacking, they're attacking)
And Ralphie Alsadek is a goddamn liar

[Outro]
Yo, you shouldn't-
Whatever don't- okay?
Drip drop
Drip drip drip drip drop
It is crazy, right now
The sun is like- like super close, to everything right now
It's like really hot, it's like unbearably hot
There's uhh- there's a hurricane monsoon
And the African Bees-
There's African Bees here too so don't come
Snowing, it's snowing
It's flooding, it's flooding (yeah)
Attacking, attacking, attacking
Tony, Tony
It's snowing, it's snowing (never rains)
It's flooding, it's flooding
Attacking, attacking, attacking
Goddamn liar
