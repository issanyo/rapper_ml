[Verse l]
I'm so sick of
Niggas talking shit who ain't in my position
Who the fuck asked you motherfuck yo opinion
No new friends I ain't adding any additions
I've Got too many suspicions
Dom went cold turkey fighting addiction
Demons got me locked inside this submission
But It was never submissive
Tired of the fables niggas be spinning
Hard keeping steady through these transition
Militant mind on a mission
Niggas can't choose a side. They stay switching
Really Most a yall as  loyal as bitches
So no don't need a mistress
Please stay back just keep yo distance
And stay the fuck out of my business
I'm out this bitch

[Chorus]
I don't fetch for niggas
Rare I respect these niggas
I Ain't a friend of nigga I
Been riding solo since
My fucking father dipped
Swear I don't owe yall shit
So Stay up off my dick
Bitch

[Verse ll[
Just to clarify Only two Niggas I fuck with
Number ones the day one the nigga who i grew up with
And dom my ride or die so that's the nigga I'm stuck with
Can't fuck with most case most of yall on that fuckshit
Fucking up but I'm still always upping the ante
Rarely ball but I'm still ball deep in ya aunty
Digging like a starving nigga inside yo pantry
Got her gushing like a geyser gushy sweeter then candy
I Ain't been desperate since an adolescent
Never stagnant always learn my lessons
I took my whooping count my blessings
Fuck yo flexing I'm progressing
Mastered the art of finessing
So Never second guessing
Mexican  standoff kinda tension
When I step into the section
Bet they start reaching for they weapons
These issues never pressing
Just make yo shot count cause real life ain't got hit detection
If you coming at my neck you best have done protection

[Chorus]
Don't fetch for niggas
Rare I respect these niggas
I Ain't a friend of nigga I
Been riding solo since
My fucking father dipped i
Swear I don't owe y'all shit
So Stay up off my dick


[Verse lll]
I admit I Fucked up once but you won’t fool me twice
Try to cross me and i’ll put you in the jaws of a vice
Yall Took advantage of the kid so now he’s not so polite
The only thing I feel pumping through these veins is ice
I be
Up and at em y'all fumblin this ain't madden
Ain't two hand touch no padding
Just s backstabbing  and grabbin
On the
Back of the bus
With a couple a bucks
Fresh out of my fucks
Ran outta niggas to trust
Yall can find me on the
On the forefront  The front lines
Double Dutch over land mines
Camel clutch til I crush spines
Double damage with punchlines
Sweep em of they feet now that's landslide
Catch a nigga talking sweet just might get some jail time
Why
Cause These Bitches stay hating
Like Nigga stay out  ganging
Like mama's stay up praying
That They sons ain't out slanging
Or out with the gang banging
Cause niggas is not playing
Duck when they k spraying
Never know never know who the aiming for
