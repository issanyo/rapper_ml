[Hook]
I've been tryna tell a different story
Find balance and I'm tippin' off
And tell grandma I be with her shortly
I won't panic when they send her for me
Cause I ain't got time for feelin' sorry
I gotta be on point when duty call
And I'm prolly the worst nigga to get involved with
These shoulders is not for you to sniffle on

[Verse]
Watch the wall collide with my fist
Mostly over problems that I know I should fix
Focused so I know my skin tone is a cliff
We on the edge and they hopin' we slip
I had to ask moms what I owed to this shit, she said "Nothin'"
She asked me 'bout them old times both of us miss, I said nothin'
She asked me if I'm smokin' again
I told her that I prolly gotta go in a bit
