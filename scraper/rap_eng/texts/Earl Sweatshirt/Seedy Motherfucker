And this morning felt peculiar when I got up
Different nigga in the mirror I had to size up
Rooted with the blinds up
This flock quiet, rather go to where they robbin'
I promise you though, it's all here
The falls and the rise
And the dark in the light be the truth when you find it
Success is options, stress get awful
If that nigga over seven then I bet he watching Sweaty often
His Ma by the karma, deep
Y'all still creeks, gon' drop eventually, still
Not gon' miss him, and that thought just tickle
Repent, think I must have lost a piece of my lung to this sink
You know you can't run from no repercussions
Can't run with the reaper, leave fucking sleeves ina brushing
It's bleak in the bumble that most my peoples grew up in
Came up from the street beside the misleading corruption
I said it before, I am the sky
My feet the struggle, tryn' keep peace on my mind
But recently Sweat had scuffle, been heated with mine
Swear it's my voice of reason that only beat up my pride
Like half the time that I needed it
The feelin' like I'm the only one I'm cheating would creep up my spine
My nigga frontin' like these syrups he says ain't weaken my drive
Crock-bowl full of bitches tryna eat up my time
Stop snitching motherfucker, keep a leash on your dime
Stop dropping 'em, bitch-ass niggas
