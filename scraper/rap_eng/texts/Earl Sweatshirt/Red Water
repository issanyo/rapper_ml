[Verse]
Yeah, I know I'm a king
Stock on my shoulder, I was sinkin'
I ain't know that I could leave
Papa called me chief
Gotta keep it brief
Locked and load, I can see you lyin' through your teeth
Fingers on my soul, this is 23
Blood in the water, I was walkin' in my sleep
Blood on my father, I forgot another dream
I was playin' with the magic, hide blessings in my sleeve
Yeah, I know I'm a king, stock on my shoulder, I was sinkin'
I ain't know that I could leave
Papa called me chief
Gotta keep it brief
Locked and load, I can see you lyin' through your teeth
Fingers on my soul, this is 23
Blood in the water, I was walkin' in my sleep
Blood on my father, I forgot another dream
I was playin' with the magic, hide blessings in my sleeve
Yeah, I know I'm a king, stock on my shoulder, I was sinkin'
I ain't know that I could leave
Papa called me chief
Gotta keep it brief
Locked and load, I can see you lyin' through your teeth
Fingers on my soul, this is 23
Blood in the water, I was walkin' in my sleep
Blood on my father, I forgot another dream
I was playin' with the magic, hide blessings in my sleeve
Yeah, I know I'm a king, stock on my shoulder, I was sinkin'
I ain't know that I could leave
Papa called me chief
Gotta keep it brief
Locked and load, I can see you lyin' through your teeth
Fingers on my soul, this is 23
Blood in the water, I was walkin' in my sleep
Blood on my father, I forgot another dream
I was playin' with the magic, hide blessings in my sleeve
