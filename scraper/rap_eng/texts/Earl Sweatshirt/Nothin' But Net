[Verse 1: Mach-Hommy]
Yes
The necromancer
I can’t take "no" for answer said so the stanza
I’m doing pull-ups in stolen Nissan's
The kimber crushin' nuts and roasted pecans
Pull out the decon and fade a rat fucker for the quesos, qué son
Couture the [?], [?]
I whisper sweet nothings on your peace bars
Fuck the rap shit, I 'member copping my first rat-chet
I remember dropping my first casket, catfish
You disappointing fans with all the antics
I shoot a nigga out his Adolf dazzlers
Hop out the Mazda and take a hat field, 9 powers
Of course the language is coated with almonds
Cogie Mohana ya honor gather bowls and with Brahmin dawgie
They cop a marrow, sofer iguana, Los Pollos Hermanos
Mama apothecaries flow in the flour
Ya like Kroger’s, it’s 2 for 1, if it chocolate diagnose it
Explosive, unspecial compulsive
Knock the sultan out his turban with the compressor and softes
Most his dead homies turnt over and next to pokers
You fucking up a nigga vision like floaters
Climatic closer, composure ya shit to ribbons like clothiers
I got this rap shit sewed up
Niggas don’t know enough
I came to talk the class, he ain’t showed up

[Verse 2: Your Old Droog]
Check
You Ferris Bueller to the school of hard-knocks
Why my name reach from V.A. Beach to Fort Rocks
How I be we hold me down with 4 Lucy’s in a box they like “Al, tell em thou shall not covet thy neighbor’s ox”
A can of O.E. was my breakfast now we copping necklaces and rollies
They getting sent to the store for rollies
Try to chill the skill plentiful still, selling raps like cereal's, bringing the General Mills feel me?
Now to buy a bunch of kicks when he pops
Count Chocula tongue golden crisp gum soul
Packing punches even if the beat ain’t a slapper
Every track snappin’ like Winter War's Cappa in casual gentleman’s attire
Gone to Kappa, stay dapper, why your shoes on lean like a rapper?
Father Y.O.D. make your heads nod without the pour up
Dissect your whole style, get tore up from the floor up (yup)
Cold killa with no rehearsal
Go against Droog?
You playing yourself like Jordan in that old commercial
Been a Don, earned stripes way before I was on
Wash the sess like a Dominican salon
I heard crickets when I told 'em put that dough up
Thought you was standup
You stood me up and half the battle is to show up
