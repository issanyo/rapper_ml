[intro: T.H-C]
Listen to this...T.H-C...Watseba (even if its the first thing you hear...even if its the last thing that you hear) real talk

[Chorus]
You can't reverse...the sands of the hour glass..can't stop the clocks hands...know one thing...time waits for no man(Tick Tock) x3

[Verse 1: T.H-C]
Time is a funny concept, counting your steps, from birth to death, for every sec, you take a breathe, better appreciate it, were we created , to be cremated, that's just something, T.H-C can't believe, so I'm up all night like i don't need no sleep, bringing heat, to each and every beat, cause in the E-N-D its a memory, my records are a legacy, for generations coming up under me, to recollect the T.H-C, cause I don't want my kin feeling like this, like shit, I wish I knew my granddad before the coffin lid was closed shut, wish I wished my aunt a proper good bye before her soul began to rise, its hard but I won't let my soul die, got eyes in the sky, that wanna see me fly, always on my grind, all my exes wanna press rewind, back to the time, we was intertwined, nowadays, I'm just hard to find, but you can't see me when you look in my eyes, way too much pride for me to beg or borrow, I come with the pay back tomorrow, my yesterdays can't be better than today, so I'm living in a relay, on a never ending circle, feeling like sipping purple just to slow it down'

[Chorus:]

[Verse 2: J Ro]
As the thoughts in my mind dread, I tend to forget all that my father said, whispers from conscience all in my ear, they don't love you, you don't even love yourself, how can I when time is never on my side, my futures dying out cause my past seems so alive and thus the present haunts me, i face it every night, I pray my friends and family before me every night, of course I'm so much pain, you couldn't imagine, how you get up when you fall is your new standard, so I'm back up on my feet, promise never to repeat, grab a seat, this prince making a throne speech, all the time on your hands can make your arms weak, make a living before your dad and your moms weak, don't you dare make your dad and moms weep, without blessing em with love that we all need ...PREACH

[Chorus]
