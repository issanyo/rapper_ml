[Intro]
Hey, excuse me
Yeah, how you doin'?
(Well) Yeah (Well, Well)
Whats your name? (W-Well)

[Verse 1]
She lift a Birkin bag like a kettlebell
Jezebel
Keep a painted face like a pitch hitter
Wig splitter
22 inch remy with ink rivers
Entire back tatted like a geisha Asian in Black reservations in Mack
She get the brows lasered
Al-Qaeda
Suicide bomber show up at your front steps
Ya nothin but some Giuseppe's in Calgon
Falconer, thats a bird on a wrist
Gazelles tarnished (Murder you nigga)
Smoke you like Philip Morris
Decedents Moorish, irreproachable threats blessings is irregardless
Building block wallet, no sweat
Specimen is flawless
Her proud father's some corrections institution profit
Her mom pop, a shorty got predictable performance
My shit is flammable, her shit retardant
It's tinder on a cusp
The fullness of her whole ass measure wasn't measurable enough
She had the nerve to dash pepper on the vegetable wit love
One God turned Christian misses singing Wanya Morris in
The mountains of north, long distance
Strange feet like Makeda
She make a wise nigga heart beat for the Amazon hair
All star player
Bet the mall ankle ball slay her
(What he say?)
All star player
Bet the mall ankle ball slay her
Slayer
