[solace]


[Verse 1]
Hmmm
Trying to find piece of earth is hell, where the hell heaven's gates?
Hmmm?
The pains gone for me, but for them its just the beginning
They miss me already
Hmmm

[Bridge] I hope it don't end that way

[Verse 2]
Me being selfish, Me being arrested
Me not being there for them when they needed me the most for helping
Me being helpless, Me chasing dimes
Me running from loaded nines
Me being you, I rather be me at all times
I won't ever have similar interest, witcha bitches
They always in somebodies business
They asking me "What you doing after high school?"
Get rich make a high-school, this ain't no game
Your 15 minutes of fame is timed, you shine, that's time!
Then your lights move
I know about those rainy days so if one cloud don't give you shine, then one check don't get you paid
