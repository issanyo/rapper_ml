[Intro : Earl Sweatshirt]
So it's straight then
'Cause everything you need to know about someone is right there
I figured that out
'Cause- people-
You can not mask it
Right here
You can never mask anything
People are freaking out
Everyone is always freaking the fuck out
And you can see it in their eyes

[Chorus : PROPH•ET]
Who wants to come in Second place in the First place
Who wants to be forgotten on they birthday
Who wants to be surrounded by these loners
That's a contradiction in my mind bruh

[Verse 1 : PROPH•ET]
I didn't ask for it
I be taking L's 'till I catch one W
While I remember when she looked at me and said I don't love you
I'm in a cold place
I'm in a cold place
Being deadly depressed in the sixth grade
That's another topic

[Bridge : PROPH•ET]
I don't wanna talk about
She was more than an option
I felt like I was adopted
Did you even read the Hobbit
Wait hold on I gotta stop
Gotta take another-
-These Xanny make me feel like I'm falling
Away from you
Away from you
Can I chill with you
"Nah you ain't that cool
You got problems
You got problems
You make me nervous
You ain't worth it"

[Verse 2 : PROPH•ET]
Started feeling bad for myself
I saw my boys grow up
While they were livin' their lives
I was stuck on the shelf
Wasn't helping myself
Drinking all of my wealth
Feelings I never felt
Dropped a couple of friends
I know you don't understand
Vomit all in my hands
My issues all in the sand
I keep looking at the clock
'Till I end up dead
'Till I end up dead
Even my bestfriend James doesn't live with his dad

[Outro : PROPH•ET]
We in the twenty somethings
Looking back we didn't know nothing
