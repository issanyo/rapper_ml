[Intro: Mach-Hommy & *Tha God Fahim*]
Yo, what's good, my nigga? Wassup?
*Motherfuckin' Dump Gawd, nigga*
Aight
*Check it*

[Verse: Tha God Fahim]
Tap my car for the martyr
Money cooked meal, the tattoo parlour (Uh-huh)
Got the samurai inked on my right arm
Heem blessed me with a Cuban for the light charm
They might harm (Boom)
So protect your position
President Nixon continental Rollie perpetual (Ayo)
This kinda ice will make you hard to trust, so I'm sceptical (Ayo, ayo, ayo, ayo, AYO!)
Professional clean fade, dress exceptional
Confessional
This Versace cloth can slay a dragon...
