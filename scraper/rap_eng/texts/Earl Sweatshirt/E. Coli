[Intro]
You see the songs, they're-
It's what I do
Just write the songs and sing them
Therefore it's pure feeling
It's complete honesty
If you can place the origin of your fear, it will disappear

[Verse]
My thoughts, dreams, plots, and my schemes
That's what's on my mind when I toss in my sleep
My heart like my pen when I jot and it bleed
My cart full of sin, when I shop it's a spree
I got some new leaves
I'm like "What's the word with you, sir?"
You just moss on a tree, I'm not concerned with you
I leave the curb when I'm crossing the street
I'm watching out for the Mark of the Beast
The badge on the policeman, black carpenter pants
A half ounce in 'em, another half ounce in my fleece
And on account of this, go â€˜head and count me out of this
I'm out with the breeze
I'm dodging county, it's a thousand degrees
It's back alley shit, my nigga, look
My eyes wide open, I'm sleepy, I'm on a highway
Paul Giamatti, a nigga was sittin' sideways
A bubble and a Skully when traveling through the Tri-state
And trouble play the gun, hear it clap and it make my mind race
Back and forth, I place fourth, keep your torch
Got your morsels on my plate, motherfucker
I wasn't born, mama snatched me off the motherfucking stork on a Friday
Say that shit to my face

[Outro]
If you listen sometimes, you can, you can get a whole conversation full of people talking
Two bars and a song sometimes
For me, knowledge is everything
Still learning?
Yeah-
I learned my whole life
I learned something last night
