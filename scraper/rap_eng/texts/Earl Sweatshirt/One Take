[Intro]
Young Nino...
Come through shining
400 for the free throw
You don't wanna fight the boy
I got too many hands for you
Pastor Troy

[Verse 1: Earl Sweatshirt]
What's the haps nigga
Quick hat tips to the pack nigga
Ride around chest full of past swishers
Eyes red like you took a bad picture
Bitch ass nigga want no problem
Whole clique gully like old ramen
Loked, riding on the coastline
And then my ho driving with a coke problem
So 'bout it, co-pilot
No pictures, I won't sign it
Old bitch and she know niggas
Who know niggas who hold llamas
Checks synch, got the gold on 'em
Goes throwed it cause the flow timing
Fresh to death and I blow chronic
In SF, so I'm 49ing
This is that shit
Cat daddy with a fat bitch
Pack navvy with the black tint
Nak nasty with the back smith
Spit crack, and I'm chapped lips
Buck nasty, get smacked quicker
Than flash-dancing in black kicks
For them racks, thrashing, I'm back bitch like
(Swag... swag take three)

[Verse 2: Casey Veggies]
With my shades on, I'm too fresh
The panties, that's Mos Def
Earl ain't lost no steps, but your chick run more laps
Make her rub my tat, Casey where them flows at
Right here nigga, go the game on lock
Since you went AWOL, homie all my shit knock
Got awesome raps, light the match
Just in fact I should flex the skills
8th grade I was skating hills
9th grade I was playing ball
12th grade I was doing deals
Graduated now im a star
My nigga rockin', might pop a pill
But I don't do that, nigga I just chill
Keep my mind right, I'm thinking 'mills
Thought it out there, give me the chills
Take a chick down, do it for the thrills
So electric, my pipe ill
Right the wheel, I might just kill
Life is real
Times get cold
Ice is hot
Get robbed for show, but I let a hater see me I'm riding slow
I sold a pound of hope
And an ounce of grow
What you gonna do when your feet hit the ground?
Thought it was a lie, they believing me now
The new me OWEE
Started grinding in ‘06
Old friends I know change and they don’t even do shit
What I’m tryna say it ain’t about the fame
But I switched up it was gettin'on
You ditched us
Your girl shows interest
She shouldn’t be doing that
On tour in Canada
Never had a manager
Peas and Carrots grow from the ground and we planted it
Guess young kids is the antidote
I’m the illest young nigga in America
Flow sick like I had sex with Erykah
Badu, Achoo
I’m not you, I’m too true
I’m a rock star, you too
BBC Sweatshirt, that’s my boy Sweatshirt
Bow down 'till your motherfuckin neck hurt

[Outro]
That was that nigga Tylers line, haha
