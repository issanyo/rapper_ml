That’s already dead
2-6 some of us still in the sticks
Baby blue crib be true to the trim
Visits from shooters and kids, scholars and boosters it’s Friday where we do it
Real foodies come thru for the lick
Spidey sense flash whiplash maneuver the webs
The info highway, forgot where you crash
Yawn and the laugh. The yard thick. Gods plan
You thinking in follies I go get it and send it before em. Whole time the memory stalking
Whole vine don’t need to be chopped
Slick fox, like Ricky we tend to the crops
Kick rocks, get loss we gone leave a mark
Marked out cause you wrong this test isn’t hard. Infamous mob how we gon end in the starts
Scars injuries end up with battery charge
The battle was lost. War 1 I had won but I’m out of remarks
Out of sparks came the galaxy thoughts, lost
