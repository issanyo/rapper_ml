I don't hear- oh I do, I do, I do
Yo, I hear myself
Yo

[Verse]
We in the bando with the hole in the kitchen floor
I'm tossin' out some samples to my loyals
Niggas spoiled, my shit is strong
Water barely even boil, my shit dissolve
They circle low like Daniel with the Romans
Cars slomins and getting dough
Permanent postponers, my nigga duh
We on the coast, we out toasting
Destroying opps, floating in rivers, gone
The crackpot oil was thick as fuck
Les Mis√©rables on ya
Paper notice on the door, you know the jig is up, bruh!
My lawyer was in the tuck
Retainers on deck like ba rumpa poy, oh boy is them niggas fucked
I'm just now knowing them niggas ducks
Bet you had no idea how far I go to get your dough in a minute though
I unload on ya business bro
Be all about bread, beyond the soil
Won't see nothing, but the nigga toes
Unload the Russian in intervals, I been the zoe
I p-put ya goon squad on it's tippy toes, you best pretend to know
