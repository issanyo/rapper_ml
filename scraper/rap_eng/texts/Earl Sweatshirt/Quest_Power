[Quest]

[Verse 1]
Tunnel vision on a guap stack
Malt liquor perspirating through the brown sack
Big talk looking thinner when it's combat
Swear that shit is astounding
I ain't stupid with cash either, I grew up around it
They overheard he shoot nice so they knew to surround him
Eating shit like he's Shoenice like the booth had a bounty
I'ma kill it, it's Early like a school night
I'm the realest that you know, my bruised soul
In the middle of group home in the locks
Threw the times I spent off in group homes in a box
I been grown boy
And cool coals you spitting just ain't hot, this fire and brimstone
You guys should've went home when you could've
Took the title, raising bars of what's supposed to be good up
His shirt drenched, they wet his rosary wood up
And who you 'posed to be, sugar
Don't get close to me
My heart cold like the fucking carrots in the grocery store
And in the morning no Folgers, just 'dro
I told my momma that I'm on my way home
I know my grandma watching over my soul
On some other shit...

[Power]

[Verse 2]
Spent nights off the downers at my desk
Did time in the tower off the spliffs
I'm not like the cowards on the fence
I'm not like I'm lounging on the bench
Get up out and get your shit
Find some power in yourself or in this shit
Listen, my niggas spit
All day give 'em what live niggas require
My state give up the prize cause I'ma find it
Anyway boy we riding
Trying to sneak the cake up out the motherfucking bakery quiet
Dodge and evade all the fire
Watch what you saying to sire
Stay out my face and my wallet
Move state to state for the profit
Said that on Sunday, you peeped it
A tiny list of my peoples
I see 'em all as my equal
So the difference between us is a just a pimp and a preacher
I'm running quick from my demons
I crush the spliff with my sneaker
You know the difference between us
These niggas fraud you could see it, all of them out of their feelings
I know my heart so I speak it
I love the squad so I lead it
Eyes wide open, I'm sleepy
I'm on the highway, I'm weaving in and out of my lanes
I call mom say, that I was all the power I needed
She say she glad I'm called she just can't believe it
I'm gone
