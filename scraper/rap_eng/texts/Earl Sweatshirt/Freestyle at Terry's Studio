[Verse 1: Earl Sweatshirt]
Y'all niggas got problems; what the fuck I got? Burners
What the fuck you saying to a real-ass nigga
Come through the streets, I got my car on ice skates
What the fuck you saying to me dog, I'm mean
Off top, came in, hit him in the spleen
Got a problem with it, chain all clean
Bitches on site, bitch I don't write
Off top, let these niggas know some dog

[Verse 2: Tyler, the Creator]
The AK-47 leave a nigga holey
Red sauce on his shirt, bowl of ravioli
I'm making that cheese, bowl of macaroni
I'm a make you my new tenderoni

[Verse 3: Left Brain]
Creep into your crib, I'll kill your daughter and your son
Then I'll hit you up with a fucking water gun
With the Odd Future water gun, it's on the shirt
I'll put you on the shirt, nigga, in the dirt
I ain't ready to lead the rap
Hold up, nigga

[Verse 4: Tyler, the Creator]
Bring it back
Niggas think the AK shit don't split
I don't give a fuck; I fucked my bitch

[Verse 5: Earl Sweatshirt]
In her pussy, what the fuck you looking at
Got a problem nigga, I could show you where we cooking at
Real nigga off top with the spit
I'm a rob til I switch to my man Dom Gen

[Verse 6: Domo Genesis]
You already know Young Doms pop the heater
Come and slam a bitch like a WWE diva
I go H.A.M. on the track, tote the mac
Any nigga talk shit, I'm a smack him with the strap
I been had bitches, been had money
Been had True Religions nigga, ain't a thing funny
So racked up, I could buy the mall
Come through shopping Mr. Big and Mr. Tall

[Verse 7: Tyler, the Creator]
Yellow diamonds on my neck like a taxicab
Bop, bop, bleed like a Maxipad

[Verse 8: Earl Sweatshirt]
Real nigga off the top with it
Come through, my diamonds look like Clicquot in the spot, nigga
Off top with the spit, bitch
I'm in the lobby, what is it? Piff lit
Real nigga off top, rich, bitch
Burner in the back, smack him in his dick

[Verse 9: Domo Genesis]
I be on the block, I be selling crack
I got that spicy-ass money, call it pepper jack
You know Doms is riding with the heater
I come through

[Verse 10: Tyler, the Creator]
I'm getting this green like a rake
I'm sneaky like a snake

[Verse 11: Left Brain]
I'm a hit a lick
I'm a hit a lick on your bitch tonight, nigga
If she don't act right, nigga, I'm a
Hit a lick on that bitch tonight
Nigga, if she don't act right tonight, I'm a hit

[Verse 12: Nakel Smith]
Be the witness, my nigga, I sell dope
I got fresh work, it came off the sailboat
Bitch ass niggas

[Verse 13: Matt]
I'm so icy that I need four wrists
Thirty bitches and my wolves in the forest

[Verse 14: Tyler, the Creator]
I'm big shit, you're poo little
Talking to your bitch, I'm Dr. Dolittle
