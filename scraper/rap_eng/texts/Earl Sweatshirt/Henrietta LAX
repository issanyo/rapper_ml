[Sample]
"Had you talked to the winds of time"

[Verse]
To all you niggas who thought I wasn't dealing on what's her face
Go lick your mother taint
I told the bitch that she was thicker than 100k
My mission more permission than quantum leap, so conversate
I hold it like Iraqis load they missiles and confrontate..
Shit, Jack boy pencil and marmalade, Los Angeles
Them other girls was thicker but the difference was the other traits
I was Haitian way before the shit was different
Shit was the other way, you pay a politician with the hush cake
The crushed grapes, is tradition in the rough place
Psychological conditioning with duct-tape
Quarter ounce of the gringa will make a white bitch dance, without clothes
For bros with foul soused in the vineyard
Playing house with your memaw, Iwo Jima, get FEMA
I could give a fuck about the shit neither
Business, real shit, since I was a jit I been a bit cleaner
Come talk bricks with the Kris Kringlah
You get, coal in your stocking for tripping
You get your shit Klingon
Star Trekkies we get the grit beam up
