Ho now don't you try
Try to pull up on me
Macy be that one man army
Ya’ll can't harm me
Cause i’m that nigga
You wish you saw in that mirror
Ispit that fire i spit that flame
I’m not concerned with these fucking lames
Just tryna make my hits
And talk my shit
Most you other niggas should just plead the fifth
Then drink a fifth and drive down ya driveway
No seatbelt speeding down the highway
Cause most yall niggas ain't got shit to say
If ain't reall with the shits then get out the way
I’m making waves get yo girl wet
If a phony nigga try to disrespect
The. it be best to protect ya neck
If you think it’s tough talk bet

Nigga bet x2
Haha nigga bet

Why yall laughing like some shits funny
Pray for the niggas that run up on me
Emergency room he's a goner
Damn man whatcha gonna tell his daughter
Tell his daughter he shouldn't have been talking shit
Thats a life lesson girl don't throw a fit
Don't get mad just get even // do not dance with these demons
Or these snakes waiting to bite your achilles
Money over bitches know we all about the millies
Get rich or finna die trying like I was a young fifty
Never showing mercy I ain't never had pity
Fade a fuck nigga any time any city
Pink fitted cap turning heads like Timmy
Need a bad blonde bad bitch hair like Cindy
This hustle in my bones but a nigga ain't nipsey

Finna
Turn the white house into a trap house
Black bandana sipping fanta blastin Bauhaus
Damn dom nigga  chill you ain't gotta pull  the mac out
Give em a little time   you that they gonna tap out
Back out back down
Hit em with the smack down
Kill the king then leave em bleedin wit a cracked crown
Should've fell back knew he didn't want axe now
Stay groovy guess a nigga pretty far out
Fuck that
Far ahead of you nigga
Either That or beheading of you niggas
Not a friend of you niggas
Never catch me breaking bread bread with you niggas
Wouldn't be caught dead with you niggas
Droppin dead weigh
You know the team mobbin shit
At the zenith you other niggas are at the opposite
Rap shit I'm rocking it ain't Nobodies else  topping this
Born in the golden  age of the apocalypse
