Im just a wannabe rasta
Eatin pasta for these ostrich knees
Still go faster than youd want to be
Wiley guys is stalkin creeper
Peeper tom binocu seers
Peakin in that crystal ball
Gettin pissed as all shit
As if its all a trick or callin
Quits an option missions off
Im gettin off a bit when all
These kids are fallin victim
To the bitchin mad pout
I stand out like a clifford dog
Wag a tail when i get to ball
For now im catchin quails
Don draper when the missus call
Im poachin all these chickens salt
N lick em make a face with bacon
Take it off with lyrics from a stainless pot on flames
Skin is flakin off
Scary drove the benz makin nary
Quick a friend
There he goes again hangin larrys
With the pen
Summers owes a debt blankfein marigos and then
Dimon time and time again
Lies with moynihan
As men try and find the time to spend
When the moneys all gone
Whose alive it will depend
Who will fight its all wrong
Can't nobody here pretend
You can't silence it for long
And when we write it like a song
And sing it people see that we could
Bring it all along and leave an
Equaler beingness
Not speakin this facetiously its
Leakin through the seams as i unravel
Travel back to when im speechless
Cuz if seein is believin im an atheist
Well maybe im the craziest but
All ive seen is everythings not what it seems at least lately shit
Hasnt changed since we been bankin on canadians to take us in
Century later barely shake a shin
You say youre raping takin names
Fakin anger why the claim to sin
Who made a kid so blatant disrespectful wait check it
This was in the wreckage from collectively opressive people
Wasn't ready for the
Public but fuck it they want the rubbish well dump it you suckin
Everybodies stomach through
That mother fucking plastic
Isnt that a gas trick?
When lappin with no stamina
Youre cardiac quits
Thats a credit card debtor guardin
Plethoras of sheckles hard to get em
Barred incestual the methods
Of the men in charge
Mentioned it already back
Bars keepin plenty licks
Past the bar
As if im keepin em a tab
From far
Yeah it has to be
Its why i get up in the lab and rappers
Act deceased
Its impossible to work with all you possums
If you lackin teeth
I wanna see em when you speak and
Feel em eatin at some meat and know they sink in
No shame in these beliefs
If reason is okay
You lackeys
No brain
Kobain
Go bang
When i blow no name
On the flow dont claim
Its just incredible steady
Cookin kettles full of mega bull
Mind impregnable
Still chillen on my lonley mostly
Just a close group of homies
Needa keep it on the low key
If you know me, you dont owe me
A thing
Im happy just to be here tryna live in a dream
Just practicing my rapping
While im pickin a beat
So relaxing when i let it go to shit
Then im free
No pun intended
Seriously no pun intended
