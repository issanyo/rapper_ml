[Verse]
Captain written-isms killin' it like Spartan spear
Pardon fear, u ain't parta here
But still lure ears
Break lyes while i make rhymes
N make styles
Golden child, peeps peep the sound n they like oh wow
Sound like an old style, I've heard that before
90's rap roots,nincompoops, don't be a jackass like eyor
' stole that style yo' guess great minds share steelos
Thievin steez of peeps incognito? natural eco my ego
Solodolo creates original no bitin like mosquito
Lethal when sun soller eclipse his evil
Mind of my own, soul holds rap arsenals
Enough to overthrown thrones, watch em get disposed like tissues from snot nose, trust me like captain knows
Take a good ear n being special to make tracks above average here
From yours truly savage, spit lavish, what an attic, fanatic
Mc scene lookin drastic like E.R
Spit shit get intercepted quick like sailor moons tiara
Degrees of saliva so sahara
Born to compose forms that rebel the system
Mans best try manifestin harmony like sister
Damn right they screaming for attention too
Cuz doom n tin sensais too reppin abstract tunes
Extract wrath n sadness watch how bastard do
Pass it to the left righteous man
Clear sight on life crisis, man, like Isis, don't want to kno what livin on ice is like lifeless lives is
Tis the season when people dry cry n hide
Real reason third pupil recognize lies, Aight
14 can't let her pass by, that's wife for life
Depression I like, Wonder what deaths like
A sick psycho who's infatuation with bushido
Heart so feeble, I met evil n half equal
My ego lethal, freedom from sativa, in sequel
