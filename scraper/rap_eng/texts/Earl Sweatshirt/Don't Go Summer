[Intro]
Yo, check it

[Verse 1]
I used to be in the hot sun
Hand on my gun, rocking a big pun
In my black Sony head phones
Walking to catch the train
Making a three hour trip from the south side to the north
It hand print
The star was a dwarf, 'til he found his way through the course
A young rap legend here to carry the torch
I do this shit for my people, of course
Take it back to the essence, gotta get back to the source
Til' my voice is hoarse, I did it on my own
Rock out like Goliath, and throw stones
I was made for this, raised a fist to Jaysus Crist
The fade is crisp, you paid for this
You lacking nutrition, in a Shinobi expedition
You get your misery hit and who you kidding?
The chain cold like white kittens
Niggas plotting on the god, they tripping

[Chorus]
Summer don't go away
In the fall, I hope the summer stay
In the spring, I wish the summer came
In the winter, catch me dancing in summer flames
Summer don't go away
In the fall, I hope the summer stay
In the spring, I wish the summer came
In the winter, catch me dancing in summer flames
Summer don't go away
In the fall, I hope the summer stay
In the spring, I wish the summer came
In the winter, catch me dancing in summer flames
Summer don't go away
In the fall, I hope the summer stay
In the spring, I wish the summer came
In the winter, catch me dancing in summer flames

[Outro]
Summer don't go away
Summer don't go away
Summer don't go away
In the fall, I hope the summer stay
