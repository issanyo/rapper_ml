[Intro: Earl Sweatshirt]
The Wrong Tundras

[Verse 1: Earl Sweatshirt]
The boy been gone a few summers
Too long for road running
Trunk full of old hundreds
Of course my old level was foggy
Grope rubbin
Don't, tell me they don't hunt us for sport I chose substances
No cuddles the bases is all covered
Niggas come in the door and smoke something
Choke up on a slugger for home run ins
Nigga its all chest thumpers
Hair [?]
We press up on it boy no more bluffin
Cold summers, don't tussle with strangers
Some of those keep one in the chamber
Three spliffs had my weak tips clipped
I was stuck in a hanger nigga
Muffle my pen and muzzle my brain up
Really i'm just making sure my promises kept
Chuck a deuce if you know its the end
Kept the truth and my palm in my chest
See a dude keep a noose hanging off of my neck

[Bridge: Earl Sweatshirt]
We got the juice niggas corny as shit
We on the loose niggas know what it is
We making moves, you niggas corny as shit
We got the juice niggas know what it is (yeah)

[Outro]
Days like these we know there is no hope, or at... Days like these we know there is no hope, or at least none that we can trust, all the old ways are dead or dying, and this is as it should be
