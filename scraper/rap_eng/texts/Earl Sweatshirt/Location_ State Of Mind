[Intro]
Uh, check it, uh

[Verse 1]
I see things clear with the eagle vision
So I can unlock the gates of this mental prison
Free yourself, free your mind, free your family
Free the blind, free the con that wanna jam me
They say practice makes perfect
Put in the time and in the end, it will all be worth it
We all got to find our purpose, I'm on purpose
Why you wanna stay about being worthless
Yo, hard work equals big pay off
Before you make it to the chips, you gotta win the playoffs
Anything that stops your shine you gotta lay off
Your perpetrating and I'mma let the K off

[Hook]
And this a hard knock life
Your state of mind is where you spend most of your life
Gotta keep your thoughts clean and [?] weapons at it's best
And happiness comes with the latter of success
And this a hard knock life
Your state of mind is where you spend most of your life
Gotta keep your thoughts clean and [?] weapons at it's best
And happiness comes with the latter of success

[Verse 2]
Success means nothing without happiness
And niggas with bad energy hazardous
I used to pen with the magic wrist
And you wildest street niggas couldn't imagine this
Build it one brick at a time
Now why cross the line when I can stretch you a nines
I keep my hands on the project, you keep your eyes on the prize
Why you looking at me stupid, here arise your demise

[Outro]

'Nam sayin, I was tired of running the streets and I just needed something to, um, give me a little more self-esteem. And that's what it did
