[Verse 1 - Earl Sweatshirt]

I rap

Gorgeous chrome-plated whores went home
Making paintings from poor quality porn flicks
Court adjourned and the verdict's still saucy
Sack swaying like Dub-D40 on a door hinge
Good lord walk light like the floor slip
Look bored hoard all mics in a force grip
Pro-abortion endorsing his own importance and
Leaving opponents floating with paper in dirty porcelain

[Verse 2 - Terra G]

Who raps rations of past fashions and crafted a
Mad racket? This rant racking the rap passion up
The tracks ragged as ram's granite with lamina
Planned damage the fans ravage a damned challenger
The masses standing up. Scrammed before they had enough
Cram em in wagon full of acid to the maximum
Half back dashing in. Half black, manic lip
Slack vans, granite spit, passing all them flaccid kids

Scalding hot as holding coals inside a scolding pot
And an oven. Smolder loathers in a molten swamp
Boasters over-bloated like a stomach known to culture shock
Those slogans told a lot. He flows until he dozes off
And critics feel the heat of singeing mics and know its sorta hot
Vocals loaded up. His flow bestows a spoken punch
Scorch the track repeated but it's far from getting over done

Tic tock and that shit rocking the house like ships docking
Feel em killing, them lips talking
And spit hocking up fire like lit stockings
Tighter than zip locking and nasty as zit popping
Shit talking, you haters are losing like ripped pockets

Keep it rigid till this frigate hits the river bed
Hipster bred
The shit he says is ripping through their tipsy necks
Him figures with spliff hitters and slim niggers
The script triggers a limp figure with limbs injured
Then spit sicker than six liquors with gin mixtures

Voluble lip arsenal starting to singe obstacles hotter than lit alcohol
On the docking block for a rocket
My flow dominant. Pop shocked at this known scholar
I wrote phonics, bitch
Baller from the start, and that part'll never falter
Startled? Spitting lava and ripping bars from this armament
Surrounded by novices, mock rockers and parliament
So I can give a fuck about your armless argument

[Outro - Earl Sweatshirt]

That's how we livin' nigga, it's not a big deal...
