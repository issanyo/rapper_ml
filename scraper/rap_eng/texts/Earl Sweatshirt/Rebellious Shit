[Intro]
Welcome to the end of the show, and I'm your host, Johnny GoodTwinkle
(Fuck outta here nigga, let's go, uh, this the rebellious shit, nigga
Start fires with this one, let's go, yeah you know what I'm talking 'bout)

[Verse 1]
I'm talking 'bout a revolution, I am Sly, kid ruthless
The booth's no spoof it, I spit it like I'm toothless
Food for the youth, while you niggas just fruit
And lies become truth, I drop shit like pollution
Stop fools quick, no problem, no solution
Your crew could sleep in the freezer, and still wouldn't be cool kids
Cruisin' in the music with the attitude of tool kits
Hammerin' these babbling niggas, respect my two cents
I can give two shits, let alone a dollar
My flows make bros go whoa, hoes say holla
Wack niggas say nada, the best, I'm a synonym
Still my pocket slim like the Olsen twins and 'em
Mr. Quick to Diss 'Em, is dismissing 'em quick in my sentences
Oliver Twist like Charles Dickens' death
Wishing competition, but listen the plot thickens
I'm a stand up nigga, well hell, I'm not sittin'

[Outro]
Never, never fail like, feel me like braille, right?
Tip top, zip-lock flow, bitches air tight
Yeah right, try and unzip it
Nigga poutin' cause he got his bitch stole by big lips
