[Verse 1]
Lookin’ at my struggle
While staring at the one in the mirror
My eyes are jacked up
So what I see looks hacked up
Get the picture?
I turn away and look around
Thinking how did it come to this?
How are my feet still on the ground?
Pride won’t let me ask for help
So my dreams which must involve other people
Are wasting away on the shelf
I got something terrible in the pot
And to add a little spice to this non-delicacy
I’m a perfectionist
But of course I’m not perfect
But I have to admit this
It’s a struggle sometimes not to feel worthless
Not to mention this constant struggle with this flesh
I’ve got to hold on to God’s Truth
Because it is the devil’s lies that I detest
And he is only adding to my stress
And what about the kingdom cause?
I know I’ve got much to do
But in my mind my pain must first be dissolved
Then to add some kick to what’s cookin
I find it easy to start pushin’ certain people away
Like I don’t want them involved
In my being deceived
It’s easy to say, “It’s easy that way.”
In my anger, I can’t stand to see certain people well off
Those who lie, cheat, and steal their way to the very top
Don’t give me a sword
‘Cause you might see some heads gettin’ chopped off
I know you think my raving rant is ridiculous
And maybe even self-centered
But I’ve got something buggin’ me
And it’s worse than pulling out a splinter
It’s summer, but my heart is growing cold
I’m scared it’ll end up colder than the coldest winter
I need to be delivered
Just being real, in me you’ll find no pretender
Feel like I gotta change my game up
Call me Ender
Switchin’ things around because I need the peace of mind
I’m thankful Jesus heals
I’m glad I am His and He is mine
What in this world can even come close to being so divine?
Nothing because without Him, things are on decline

[Verse 2]
Well… back to my story
Thank God it’s not gory
I just need to give Him glory
No matter what state I’m in
My financial struggles and other troubles can’t last forever
Can’t wait til they get put under rubble
Or maybe I’ll blast them so far into space
To see them you’d need the scope called the Hubble
I’ve been sittin’ here too long
At times my mind seems too gone
With things weighing me down how can I move further along?
I’m giving my burdens to Christ
I know it’s in Him I’ll rise
There’s no need to fantasize
Can’t wait ‘til He returns
But that day and time will truly be a surprise
And I surmise
That what I need to do until then
Will be revealed to me by the Almighty
So I’ll carry on and say, “Alrighty.”
As I hold on to His precious promises tightly
But I can’t help but feel like I’ve stayed the same too long
While things around me keep changin’
It’s not material things I’m chasin’
But it’s God’s presence for eternity
For which I’m waitin’ and anticipatin’
Godly choices are what I should be demonstratin’
At least I haven’t been pulled into the world of drugs and freebasin’
A trap star’s life is what I don’t wanna be imitatin’
I’ve been prayin’ I’m not losing my way in
And haven’t started the way of flakin’ and takin’ what I shouldn’t be takin’
I’m not faded, but I’m feelin’ jaded
Shoot I’d hate it if I ever did damage while wasted
Don’t wanna see me take that drink to the head and have to chase it
And I know I’ve been shadin’ some things the wrong way and
I need a paradigm shift easy
Eyes to see is what I really need, best believe
So Lord please quickly shift me
Before I mess around and jump off where this cliff be
I need the real me safe from myself, see?

[Verse 3]
Well… Thank God for His peace
I look for it when I see the sun rise from the East
I will not stop progressing
No matter how much I’m stressing
Each day is a blessing
So I will just take this time to not worry
Because it’s in Christ I’m resting
Yea I will not worry or try to vainly hurry
No matter how strong the troubles’ flurries
I’ll be trusting in my Lord
Come what may
Because I’ll be using God’s Word
That is…my Sword
