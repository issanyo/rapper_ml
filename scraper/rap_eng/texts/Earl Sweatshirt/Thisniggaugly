[Verse 1: Tyler the Creator]
This my little brother on my mother's side, our father died
He was living with my grandmother on the North side
Of Sacramento, but this fag ain't just visiting
He's settling in, he can't wait to start meddling
And doing the evil shit we do (Does he skate?)
Yeah he skate too (Man, thisniggaugly) and he raps, ooh
This the newest Wolf Gang member and he
(What's his name?) Earl

[Outro: Taco and Tyler]
Nigga, this nigga's forehead is so fuckin' big
This nigga, look at this fuckin' nigga lips, dog
This nigga's lips look like a split sundae
Yo this nigga's line is bended, that's fucked up
Yo this nigga, this nigga look like a African poet
Earl, say somethin'
Yo this nigga's forehead looks like a fuckin' big-ass moose
Nigga, don't be nervous nigga, say somethin'; trust me guys, he can rap
He a bitch, just say somethin'
Nigga, don't be a bitch nigga, say somethin'
Nigga, rap, you fuckin' suck probably
Trust me guys, he can rap, just say somethin'
