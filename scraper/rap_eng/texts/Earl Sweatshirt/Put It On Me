(Verse)
Yeah they call me John like Lennon, yeah
Legends live forever fuck trending, yeah
Back in 6th grade had the waves they was swimming
Tried to make the team got cut, I was finished
Picked the pen and paper up like Nas, "It Was Written"
Now I'm Tom Cruise on a mission
Plottin' on ya sisters
Penthouse Swisher
Been Down witcha
Shoutout to the one's that's always ridin' witcha!
Told her that she gotta make appointments just to DICK her!
When I'm on the road don't get mad if I don't pick up
Johnny Hilfiger, heart cold like Winter
Damn, I used to know this bad bitch named Winter

(Bridge)
But it's all about the green
Hoes on me
If That A$$ Fat Put it all on me!

(Chorus)
Put it All On Me
If That A$$ Fat Put it All On Me
