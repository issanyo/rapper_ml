[Verse 1: Earl]
It's the blackest piece of trash they seen in a RV park
Holla at your guala if ever you feel your weed sparse, nigga
Salty tee off with us just know that T brought villains
My nigga we all itchin' to see you dropped
I don't wanna chop it up never fronted like I'm the nicest
Fame faze him not the slightest, aim stainless at your iris
Take paper out your pocket, as sure as Toyo tires round
That fucking little schisty clown is back in full effect
Little teeny tiny Sweat, he biting bitches by the neck
Got my fucking dick as long as lists of shit I should regret
A little bit depressed that's why the winter fit him best
I guess a little biased to the cold, mix the Ritalin and sess
Because I like the highs and lows and I also like the checks
That I'm siphoning from shows, and triple six the set
The set run it back, tight as Corey Duffel pants
Doing niggas dirty as the motherfucking plunger cap
My main and my ex screaming like it's a habit
Move immune in between 'em because I'm diplomatic
Catch me in your city passive, cleaning up my shitty act
Bitches say them gritty raps be making up for shit he lacking
And them kitty kats that got him missing Jerry's Thomas
Burpin' words that's hotter than the pocket where he carry chronic
Very awesome so spare the comments, I'm bi-coastal
Paid and chugging forties you niggas can keep your wine toasted
