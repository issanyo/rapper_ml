I need the tint
Just like my daddy skin - dark
I see your nigga, too bad he a mark
I see real niggas just jab, they don't bark
I see you tryna' rekindle the spark
Reelin' from loss
Inner remorse, your voice just spirit and corpse
I tell y'all I'm hearing it all
The wisdom that's in your remarks
The silliness in you, I mourn
The moments that's tender and soft
I'm in em', the memories got strong
Some of them lost
The silliness in you, I mourn
The moments that's tender and soft
I'm in em', the memories got strong
But some of them long gone

I took the cookies put em to the side
Sunny day but I'm cooking inside
Muddy path but I'm taking my time

Sunny day but I'm cooking inside
Muddy path but I'm taking my-
