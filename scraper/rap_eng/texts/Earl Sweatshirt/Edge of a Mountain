Yeah, X

{Verse: Cinema X}
Im sometimes ignorant to my own visions
My intentions, and won't listen to own living
I can speak on topics, but already written down
Seek truth, but how the hell is you sittin' down
I try not to seem like im preaching
But affirmative is the only way that im reaching 'em
Or maybe not, maybe im just speeding
To conclusions and teach the wrong thing, i needed
To catch myself, before my fans become routers
And leave me hanging from a root, not a flower
We all fall into our own quest for power
Some fail, some succeed, get to top floor of tower
All begin at the bottom, crawl to top for hours
But die of exhaustion at the summit (call it power)
Fly across the sky, but really always running
In place of lost, and never accomplish nothing
Say it double negative, did i actually spit something
Or just wasted time, i call that technique (trumping)
At the pinnacle of a mountain, we will all sit
Who stays, exactly how history decides it
Will be great for time, but none will remember you
In less than a century, they already dismembered you
Your family too, living for two but never grew
Never knew, what was possible before they applied the glue
(Never knew, what was possible before they applied the glue)
