[Part I]

[Intro]
I've been here before
I've been here before
I've been here before
I've been here before
I've been here before
I've been here before
I've been here before
I've been here before

[Verse]
Late for everything, my face to the cement
That's how I always seen it
I spent days faded and anemic
You could see it in my face, I ain't been eatin', I'm just wastin' away
Looks like the way that River Phoenix went gon' end up my fate
And when they drag me out the gutter, mail the ashes to my mother
Twist the spliff if I don't finish my plate
Slip a fist up for my niggas in chains, my mental was caged
See, I ain't been to prison but the feeling's the same
Shared sentiment, winnin' if the pen hit the page
As of late, I've been watchin' every bitch in my space
Shit's just lookin' different with age
Try to make some sense of all this shit in my brain
One foot stuck in a tar pit of my ways

[Part II]

[Intro]
And if it's like that the whole time
If it's like that the whole time, we'll be alright
And if it's like that the whole time, we'll be alright
Stayin' up all night, but it's alright
And I been stayin' up the whole night, but it's alright

[Verse]
It's me and my nibbling conscience
Nigga, I'm fixin' to give up
I've been alone for the longest
It's trouble, the way that we joggin'
Nothin' gon' save us or stop us
Me and my nibbling conscience
Nigga, I'm fixin' to give up
I've been alone for the longest
This spliff, I ain't splittin' no time soon
My brain split in two, it's rainin' a bit
I hope it's a monsoon, my face in the sink
I'm seein' my mom soon, I'm faded, I stink
Stay in it, alright..? (faded, I'm stayin' in...)

[Instrumental]

[Part IV]

[Verse]
I got my grandmama's hands, I start to cry when I see 'em
'Cause they remind me of seein' her
These the times that I needed her most 'cause I feel defeated
And I buy nothin' by myself, my second thoughts, my sec
(And I buy nothin' by myself)
My hands, I start to cry when I see 'em
'Cause they remind me of seein' her
These the times that I needed her most 'cause I feel defeated
And I buy nothin' but myself, my second thoughts
My hectic process of thinkin' and all my doubts, and I think
I know Nak in there sleepin', he on the couch, that's my brother
Give me a boost when my confidence need it, so I love him
To tell the truth, I got a problem with eatin', I be druggin'
To tell the truth, I'm not supposed to be off in here
I'm supposed to be sleepin', but I be turnin' and tossin'
To tell the truth, I miss my partna dem
To tell the truth, you can't be loud when you're the wrongest, fam
To tell the truth, I'm at a loss of friends
Well time waits for no man and death waits with cold hands
I'm the youngest old man that you know
If ya soul intact, let me know
