To you I'm just over apologetic
You make me weaker, I saw a rose in your driest image
Covering up your weakness by soldiering through the menace
Society breeds within us
You're no surprise, I see your flaws and I find there isn't
Nothing wrong with your wrongs and that two of them make a right
But keep on duplicating lies and we might call it suicide
So just wait for me to die, then bless me with your affection
I wanna martyr myself for anybody who's stressing
From all the dues of the present
Let alone you, you shed some light on my darkest segments
Fighting the cost of getting myself involved with your blessings
I overdosed on your presence
Comatose as I'm forced to get off of your anaesthetic
My heart's to the lowest bidder
Soul is a fire
How come I'm colder than five Decembers
I'm flyer than what you're swatting
I'm up and down like a coaster for long as I can remember
Anxiety riding me like a master on to a nigga
Shit, I'm sorry Kara
I hope your happiness spreads all over all of your eras
Like us when we locked together
Maybe my guys would tell me yo Jodye you not the nigga
For letting you know that I ain't been whole since we not together
But it's whatever, I think the shit that I did just needed to not exist I just felt it was now or never
And now I guess it's never, maybe for the better
At least for you, and if thats true, believe me to the letter
That every boo I've had since you has seen you on my dresser
And every time I come inside her I wish I'd been better than ever
They ask questions and its detrimental pressure
How'd you fall for me I'm just a nigga under stressors
Like you still in love with her?
After all the years with no face
She was tryna rep for the city
I call her noname
She called me just once to be just telling she was sorry for
Never being as perfect like someone named me had warranted
I perfected my warrant and interjected like officers
I don't really like bacon but I was baking a lot with her
So if you tryna be her, you better bring some reefer
I'ma have your pussy meowing from the way I eat it
I might say I love you and shit you just might believe it
Loving til it hurts because he hurt you when you needed
Something more than orthopedic, we got slaughtered, it was scenic
My room is church and I'll break your body like Jesus
Til you become a believer
To keep me out my visions and keep me from being a dreamer

To keep me from being a dreamer

Pouring from the faucet
I'm not really tryna force it
These emotions pouring out
It's like their falling from a faucet
