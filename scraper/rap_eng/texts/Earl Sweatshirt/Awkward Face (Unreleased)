[Verse 1]
Half the niggas you know would cap a nigga, game is my son
I'm the daddy, I'm swattin' the fuckin' finger roll
Spit for the give-and-go, good before this shit hits the hole
Buddy I'mma great look
Nigga, it's the swamp, but most of young niggas weight push
Like they in the yard dogging
Backwood on my lip, hoodie blacker than all my forefathers
On an interlude or an interview looking bored
Awkward face, chopped and screwed
'Cause I hate the stench when a whore talking
Quick witted, the kids in the hall doubted
Never had time for bitches, too busy denying counselin'
Thorough niggas only was worth it to ride out with
Pussy nigga, get your blouse did
How's this for starters?
Lit, lit 'til the lawn built, call the pallbearers then, I fall to the pit
Get 'em all out of this, I ain't honoring shit
But my mom in some Kohl's, and the obvious shit
And my dogs in the streets, and we clogging your bowl
Like your block or your street, or your blog and your feed
Ayy, I bet you wish you could hit the reef, bitch

[Verse 2]
I am the shooter reloaded who only move with one motive
To kill it, using this cloak and
Know that I roast it and flip it, it's nothing
Stifling hoes a custom, the dick in they throat
I bust on the tip of they noses, y'all need a napkin or something?
Just use a stack of this money
I only laugh 'cause it's funny
I whip an ass and rap with laxative tummies, shit
And I need that wall
Plastered with them plaques and that cash in abundance
Catch me on 'Fax with a couple cancer sticks
Hit me for cold and passionate loving, uh only khakis I'm cuffin'
Little man with no manners bitch, I am actually dusty
