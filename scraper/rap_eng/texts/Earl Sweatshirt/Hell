[Verse 1: Earl]
It's Santa Claus on my boxers, Golf Wang, that next season
Turned down a few offers, label checks keep the neck freezing
Little Timmy get the flex pardon, tipped off in that beer garden
I am that nigga, you are that nigga we fear hardly
Storefront cause that shit poppin', OF and your bitch 'bout it
Tell the ho that I'll kiss proper then take her she get posse like
When I'm lit, nigga get cocky, love trees like Mitt Romney
Hundred deep so don't get bodied
That's a hundred deep so don't get by me
Nigga, fuck with me, I do that, hit the Grammys in a do-rag
She [?] for the CEO, that's Flog Gnaw, watch ya knees, ho

[Hook]
If that's on you, then that's on me too
If that's on you, then that's on me too
If that's on you, then that's on me too
If that's on you, then that's on me too
If that's on you, then that's on me too
If that's on you, then that's on me too
If that's on you, then that's on me too
If that's on you, then that's on me too

[Verse 2: Na'kel]
My shirt tucked into my trousers, we not goons, guns, we got 'em
I conceal tho, I am not a felon, y'all niggas rap bout it but I model
American boy, American boy If you’re wondering who shot him
Testino and Bruce Webber hoe, if he skates ya block then I’ll rob it
Like fuck rap [?] and [?] I don't give a fuck, that nigga darkskin
Then a 28 Y'all niggas talk skate, but I’m really ‘bout it
But I don't really though, I need a fuck, nigga I wear [?]
[?] Fuck niggas, suck it up then get it hoe
Fuck this rappin' shit, i just went pro like Nike out [?]
Red beam leave his spleen leaking, Trashwang, nigga we creepin'!
Trashwang, nigga we creepin'! Trashwang, nigga we creepin'!
Trashwang, nigga we creepin'! Trashwang, nigga we creepin'!

[Hook]
If that's on you, then that's on me too
If that's on you, then that's on me too
If that's on you, then that's on me too
If that's on you, then that's on me too
If that's on you, then that's on me too
