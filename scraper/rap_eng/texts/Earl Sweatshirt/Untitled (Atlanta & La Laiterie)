[Intro]
Get your lady cop
Piff, inhale & cough
Rip the label off this
Picked the road that got twists
I'm holdin' my dick & playin' cautious

[Verse 1]
I'ma show you how it's done right nigga
Drop this when the sunlight gone
Better run right home when the sky turn black
Screaming fuck five-o til' my line go flat
& That ash gray bimmer
People will be calling at the pigeon coop
Jack knife bitches to they couches in they living room
Ask who the best & I doubt that they picking you
Back like Caillou & the style, I invented you
Act like you don't know the name
Only time I ain't mute
When the choke just stanky
Listening to Pre getting dome while I lane switch
Bitches by the three licking coke off the pavement
Poster child you 'posed to hate me
Bold & wild you broke & angry my nigga'
Name gettin' bigger than the nigga' from [?]
Niggas is fake I limit the features I give em'
SWEAT (SWEAT!) SHIRT (SHIRT!)
You know you famous when the niggas that surround you switch
And If they hatin' then they'll pass the titts
Now they houndin' dick & You ain't ask for this
Now you surrounded with a gaggle of a hundred fucking thousand kids
Who you can't be mad when they want a pound or pic
Cause they the reason that the paper in your trousers thick
And They the reason that the paper in your trousers thick
I said, SWEAT (SWEAT!) SHIRT (SHIRT!)
You can tell the reaper I'ma meet him when he send for me
With a cleaver and a thirty & Some twisted weed
I'm thick blooded, let the crimson leak nigga'

[Verse 2]
You used to say you liked violins
And your lifestyle depends on me
And I know it's night time when you get lonely
And tell all your little friends how that bitch stole me
And despite all of the facts that you got phony
You gon' tell em' bout' the night that you exposed me
For the bastard I was & how I probably smashed every bitch
That I passed in the club in the last couple months
Was it worse cause I smashed all the trust
That I earned in the past couple months
That we had as a couple
My absence of fuss was a problem
That we ain't never really get to solve
We just smashed then we scuffled
Try and keep it calm but I snap at you
Now you taking all your property back
And It's obvious that apart from the fact
That we fuck and itâ€™s bomb, man I hate when you home, Man, I hate when you home
And when I'm gone I don't call cause you nag
Man I'm going through the shit & I bought you some shit
What you offering here?
