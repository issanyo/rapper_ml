[Verse 1]
Chef Sweaty braising your faculty
Face getting gray from the ash, but I'm laughing
That's the trace in me, nigga
Fuck out my face while I'm thinking
Ain't step foot up in my momma place for a minute
My days numbered
I'm focused heavy on making the most of 'em
I feel like I'm the only one pressin' to grow upwards
It's still fuck you and whoever you showed up with
Trying to see an M and some steadier hands
Who you callin' your mans?
Bet you thought he was solid, when he really just sand
Washing away with the water
I'm a land mammal staying away from the altar
Shit changed in the August, in the wake of that August
Last autumn the leaves fell, and I raked in the profit
Disobeying the doctor
The good guy prescribe, faith never caught 'em
Chasing these rabbits, whole face in a faucet

[Hook]
And I don't know who house to call home lately
I hope my phone break, let it ring
Toe to toe with the foes, new and old
Basic hoes try to cage him like the po'
When I run, don't chase me
And I don't know who house to call home lately
I hope my phone break, let it ring
Toe to toe with the foes, new and old
Basic hoes try to cage him like the po'
When I run, don't chase me

[Verse 2]
Solid, so the funds don't phase me
On tour wildin' by the truck stop racists
Hard as finding me a, a common thread between us
Raised different, my momma, she born, bred the leader
Get shit poppin' like the gun's off safety
Sayin' easy and doing harder when you get caught up
Raised neck and neck with Nak, so I’m a fluent brawler
Rain checkin’ on ya plot if ever bread should pop up
Out the toaster I gotta focus, my family problems
Shrunk and widen with the bumps in my personal finance
It hurt 'cause I can’t keep a date or put personal time in
Or reverse to the times when my face didn’t surprise you
Before I did the shit that earned me my term on that island
Can’t put a smile on your face through your purse or your pocket
Shit in a pile, never change, I’m stupid for tryin’
Still just too busy wildin’ (still)

[Hook]
And I don't know who house to call home lately
I hope my phone break, let it ring
Toe to toe with the foes, new and old
Basic hoes try to cage him like the po'
When I run, don't chase me
And I don't know who house to call home lately
I hope my phone break, let it ring
Toe to toe with the foes, new and old
Basic hoes try to cage him like the po'
When I run, don't chase me
