I promised myself I was gon' be not hype on this
I'll calm it down, down, down
Yeah, ay

[Verse 1 - Denmark Vessey]

It's like a Black [?] Brown song
Where OJ is still elligible
Or a outdated reboot of Juice
Titled, Drink
The Hollywood reboot of Roots
Titled, Suits
That recast Tobey Maguire as the lead
Can you solve our plight in a verse?
A screaming nigga post
Teddy pay a effigy visual casually nickel though
Clever euphemisms for plantation and kitchen stove
Trappin' cool G chop will leave you underneath the mistletoe
Yo, I hit the loud so hard I call her [?]
Spit strawberry [?] so hard, feel like a physical
I drag a slab of stone so long, it caught the el out
I hit the peak so hard, gold rings fell out (damn)
Sleep paralysis smooth the screams that I yell out
Stressin' over cream got me contemplating thievery
You ain't even got no bond money to bail out
Shit nigga, rap don't work out I'm whipping this fish scale out
Prolly not though
I watched The Wire, it looked fire
But I checked the online, the streets not hirin' bro
I know I heard you keep on trying, I know, it's over though
The sun went nova when you asleep
In this house party scene 'cause I'm sedated
I was leanin' drinking wormwood, now I'm absolute minded
No fucks given, I'm in defiance
My fingers holding onto that blanket talkin' with Linus
Skim through life in a shopping cart at Target
Woke up the next day in an OK-Mart
Took my mask off, 'cause [?] told me to
Hands up don't shoot

[Verse 2 - DrxQuinnx]

Hoes on my dick, I pray to based god
It's word to your baby moms
Mixed up the lemonade to serve it at the all star game
That's the sour taste of petty
Fuck all that rubber, I'm just tryna fuck Betty
Quarter nickels by the dam, that goes by the name of Penny
Black licorice, taste the [?] good and plenty
Hit the devil whip with that drift its all wavy
Walk through Steins Gate, it's funky in that rabbit suit
Stabbed the mirror till I fell through
Malice in that Wonderland, the mercury done got him loose
Where purple hearts of water where the [?] talking hoots
Tweedledee fuck niggas, cats is what you talking to
Crazy motherfuckers

We're all magic, we're all magic

[Verse 3 - Vic Spencer]

They told my ass to rap over drill beats
I asked, what would you do if you saw a pill speak?
I am ready for challenges, I damage kids
Need to shut the entire fuck up before I blam a wig
Yes, man for sure off the banners
Signed to a label just to go buy outlandish stuff
You should go into retirement, but I can't
UPS is no longer hiring
Violent like where they got traffickers at
You gotta slow down
Niggas gotta energize that
I'm 'bout to blow pounds
Can you talk about group homes and shit like that?
They way y'all talk y'all act like I don't fight back
Rappers be mad, they never on my radar
One day a fan said, I was heavier than a freight car
Woke up and threw my feelings from out a night jar
Humans now a days looking like a walking side bar
Since a nigga start rapping they want me to have a [?] car
But my circle too personal, you a rap slave
You should choke on rope
I'm records with Sean Price
He like, you should rap over Young Chop beats
I'm walking with a chick that's knock-kneed
You wanna play ding dong ditch, beer pong sips
Make longer songs for them real long trips
So I can time myself
They say my career is over and I should cry for help
You get your ass whooped with a try-it belt
Ha-ha, pussy boy, ha-ha ha-ha
