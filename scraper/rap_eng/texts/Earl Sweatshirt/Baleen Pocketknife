[Chorus: Tha God Fahim]
Why you baller blocked?
I swear we all we got
Yo who calling the shots?
I be there when it drop
Rather you hear it or not
They be there in a pot
Plenty despairing their hearts
Dark beat hell, and it’s hot

[Verse 1: Tha God Fahim]
I got a business agenda with legal tenders
We out to make pulverising figures
The mind'll write your sin [?] cut out any rival members
My rhyme endeavours any sign of devils
Won't align to levels in my kinda ghetto
I can't sit on my hands, can't go astray on my path
All this time that passed, Im not tryna be last
Souls demised and take on new vibes
Break all crew ties, can't straighten up loose lies
I was wise toting, gassing, growing up traumatised
Beat the eyes, your fate can't let the streets decide
'Cause if you do, you'll be in the box early, get popped early
But in the end we all get buried

[Chorus: Tha God Fahim]
Why you baller blocked?
I swear we all we got
Yo who calling the shots?
I be there when it drop
Rather you hear it or not
They be there in a pot
Plenty despairing their hearts
Dark beat hell, and it’s hot

Why you baller blocked?
I swear we all we got
Yo who calling the shots?
I be there when it drop
Rather you make it or not
They be there in a pot
Plenty despairing their hearts
Dark beat hell, and it’s hot

[Verse 2: Mach-Hommy]
You outsider as hell, I could tell you not from my world
Where lil niggas will flip you like white girl, what about my pearls?
A [?] missing out my 12, whip out my curl
Introduce to you to the bitch, if you new to this shit you stife as hell
Time in bells, YSL belts, tie it down
Tie it right around, fly as hell
Them niggas fire rounds
Higher realms, wire crowns
Just get me Golden Globes, I give you fly style
My account counts, you liars bounce
I announce, I pronounce
[?], yes
They gotta see much death
More press, more reps
Much flesh, more breathe
More pull-ups, more stress, more checks
