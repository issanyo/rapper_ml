[Intro]
My nigga
Keep faith

[Verse]
Peace to every crease on your brain
Peace to who came before me in the game
We givin' praise and glory to your name, kid
We cellophane your story so it stays
Since birth mama raised and burped me, I ain't changed
I'm a man, I'm just saying that I stayed imperfect
Earl is not my name, the world is my domain, kid
Air Max 97 creps on the pavement
Hair got knotty, let it settle on my face, I
I've been eating good you can see it in my tummy
But I'm buggin', I've been spending more money than I'm making
Stuck in Trump Land, watching subtlety decayin'
I ain't touch a xan, when it-
When it's time to put my burnt body in a case
Tell my momma I said thank you
Tryna state facts, I'm tryna get through the day
I'ma play the back, I ain't into showing face, kid

[Segue]
It's been a minute since I heard applause
It's been a minute since you seen or heard from me, I've been swerving calls
It's been a minute since I heard applause

[Refrain]
Sittin' on a star, thinking how I'm not a star
I can't call it, dog
Sometimes I feel like I wanna call it off
I can't call it, dog
Big dog, finna rip the collar off, uh
Sittin' on a star, thinking how I'm not a star
I can't call it, dogs
Sittin' on a star, thinking how I'm not a star
Just can't call it, dogs, ayy

[Outro]
Keep pace, my nigga (Eat paste my nigga)
Be safe, seek sake my nigga
Keep faith, my nigga, (Yeah yeah) ah
Me safe, she safe, keep pace, my nigga (Keep faith)
Peace, peace, peace, peace, peace, peace

[Refrain]
Sittin' on a star, thinking how I'm not a star
Just can't call it, dogs
