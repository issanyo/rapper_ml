[Sample]
"We will be together, till the end of time"

[Verse 1: Kungg Fuu]
Remember cold nights with Topanga in my socks
30 stick make 'em lift like Static Shock
Snake skin belt like I'm Alligator Dundee
Fuck these goofballs, I'm only focused on the money
Strapped up like Men in Black
Hoes want to catch you lackin'
That's why I've organized my whole faction
It's the eloquent murderer, who support fiends
Take time to replenish but still stack cream
Keep hammers cocked back, besides that
Seen people get killed for that dollar bill
I advise that, you move cautious
On a mission for a bigger fortress
Marble floors, pay advances to my lawyers
Everything I do is for the fam
If I'm broke then I'm sliding in your crib like Slender Man
I perform the shit make you pass out
Until the end of time on my grind, never ass out
Imma get it by any means
Any threat to me you clapped with the Jackson like Billy Jean
Endure pain I'm a soldier and a rider, I never quit
Devil slayer dropping the elements

[Bridge: Mach-Hommy]
Hold tight (you better hold on to it), hold tight
You better hold on to it
You never ever know if heaven close doors, do it?
You better hold on to it (hold tightt)
You never know if heaven close doors

[Verse 2: Mach-Hommy]
Faberg√© potato on the eight-o, huevos, rancheros
I rock a muscadine while he sprints, barredo
Disengage the hitch and sail
Betrayal, it's all braille
I feel it with my tips and make a wish and bail
Leave 'em on the strip like Chippendales
Alfa Romeo, a crown viper swallowing Amora mayo
Ayo that's a pickle, your life is like a sandwich
Either way I flip you, all about my pumpernickel, you unofficial

[Outro: Mach-Hommy]
Hold tighttt
