[Intro]
Everyone mind stuck on druggin' now

[Verse]
I figured I just switch on all of my other styles
Stopped smokin blunts, I can run a mile
I can't go out cause they gun me down
I'm coming up from the under
Know you'll hear that thumping sound
No peace in your stomping ground
Booming like a thunder cloud
Chicken with no head, how you run it now
Shit can get ugly
If I'm takin' shots then I'mma get the bucket
Don't you run up on me while I'm out in public
I got two hands and I trust 'em
One fits perfect in a running mouth
Be a slow learner when it's turning down time
I went cold turkey, now it's back to
Slow burning herbo when I get some down time
Only difference is, from the last time, bitch I'm outside

[Hook]
It's toasty again
'nother homi, another soul in the wind
'nother body gettin' poked with a stick
I be outside, aye
It's toasty again
'nother body rotten', poked with sticks
'nother homi, another soul in the wind
I be outside, I be outside
It's toasty again
'nother homI, another soul in the wind
'nother body gettin' poked with a stick
I be outside, aye
I be outside, aye
