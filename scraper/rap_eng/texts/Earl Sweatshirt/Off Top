[Intro]
(Cough)
Fuck... Yo, I gotta stop smoking backwoods

[Verse]
"How you doing?" And what's your motive, ho?
I only trust these bitches bout as far as I can throw 'em
Trying to pay my momma rent, figure that's just what I owe her
I been trouble since I tumbled out that stroller
Strollin', easy down this narrow path, beefin' with your scary ass
'Preme got my little niggas cheesing off the cherry ad
And nigga, that's a great lunch
Poppa swamp and stomping with the skate fucks
Heavy handing tracks until the day the fucking train come
Raised up where every mouth that speak the truth get taped shut
Peep the evening news, my nigga, we don't do the same stuff
Kiwis couldn't take us, boy, I'm jogging around these bases
Niggas pitches need to change, I separated from my main one
It's just another day, another nigga's bitch to face fuck
I been like this since the Motorola Razr
What a bastard that baby was
Little mad nigga missing dad, never praying much
Right around the same time his grandmama drank a bunch
Take the bus, take a niggas seat like it was made for me
I got this nigga Da$h with me, he sipping on some maple leaf
I'm only happy when there's static in the air
Cause the fair weather fake to me
Living in the scope, hairs crossed like adjacent streets
Dare a nigga think it's sweet, never, bitches funny boy
You berries and you honey for the bear that's here to tear and eat
Run a niggas pockets like some errands, make it hasty
I hope the sheriff keep away from me
Hope the sheriff keep away from me
Hope the sheriff keep away from me
