I'm picky with words
I edit my verses
You bet if I said it, I said it with purpose
I'm just not a regular person
Hard to sympathize with Early
I hug the wall like a mural
Need percocets in plural
Young nigga lost in the world, just spent up all of my euros
I don't have time for you girls, that's why I be with my girl
I give her dick and she gives referrals
All of these hoes, it's just me in a jersey
I'm playing the venue, see that's what my work is
No need to research me, boogeyman is the I.D. for my work
I know that you heard of me
Wait for your sleep then your feet feel a jerk
We on a murder spree
This is a burglary
Taking your soul and the bling off your shirt
Like we rehearsed and the screaming don’t work
We got your mafuckin' dream in a hearse
We make it work
Cut the loose ends
No new friends
So I'm always lonely
Even if he shakes yo' hand
That don't make that man your homie
Maybe cause I'm up right now while all these hoes on me
Maybe cause I'm up right now while all these bitches on me
Can't forget what they told me
Fuck em
My older homie told me
Fuck ‘em, motherfuck 'em
My momma told me nigga
Fuck 'em, motherfuck 'em
I say fuck 'em, fuck 'em
