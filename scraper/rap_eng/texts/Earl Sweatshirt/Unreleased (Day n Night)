Uhh we official, no dice we rolling together the end frigid I froze with you at night
Get your energy right
The enemy coming in by the droves don't give them control
My own issues on the back of the stove burning like coal in a caboose
You know the boy's the truth, sojourner
My old earth was on some greazy shit, need a kiss
Sayonara to the slow learners 'til we meet again
Like auf Wiedersehen
Like the work ain't the cleanest, but it's worth it when you need a win for sure
I'm finicky with words like my easel drip, we tend to hit a nerve like
I'm tending to the turf when it need defense, nigga
