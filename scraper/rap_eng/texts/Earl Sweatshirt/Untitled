Wolf gang set off the car alarms
Ive been the same as I was before I had gone
And this prolonged, chronic rapping son who belonged
To a father who left, told mom to keep an eye on
Yeah, sent away quick, to become a mute swan
Whos really there, when you need someone to hang on
Niggas who were friends, slip em' a gallon of exxon
To flush em' out, and slowly, fuck islands, theyre lonely
Referenced, im in the book, the one and only
Breaking out fights like a canadian playing goalie
Fuck religion my nigga, im the only one holy
My futures even, keepin it lowly
Gawking the spat through your tooth gap
I dont need a crew, lets just keep it at that
Im that scab to pick at, flying solo, European brown bat
Caught up in a group of domestic cats
Strike on up at bat, you stick to me like gnats
Living in a home wit' welcome back on my place mat
