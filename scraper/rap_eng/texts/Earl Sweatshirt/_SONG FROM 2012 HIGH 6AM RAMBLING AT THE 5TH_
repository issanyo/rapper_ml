[Verse]
Bottom of a rocket, hot as tamale
Ganja lit, squad legit, armor whips
Roll call, state your name
Sweatshirt, see him flex, tweet it
Next seated, and gave him my ex demons
Invading the rest, speedin' straight into the next precinct
I'm makin' a mess, leave it
I can't breathe
Floatin' off the best product
Get money, and dress awful
I'm holding a press conference, address nonsense
Nigga slanging wood like a deck sponsor
Now piss off bitch (bitch)
No off switch (switch)
Been hard since (since)
Since pimpin' been pimpin'
Let's go and fix the exposures
So you can picture me rollin' and dumpin' clips on a poser
A slangin' bricks in the holster
That hold the 5th is emotional
And they cryin' and sobbing, but now it is raining all over you
I guess the chickens just came home to roost
Pigs fly every day
Couple hundred on the hay sack
Blunted in the way back
Fuck you and your lame tats
What I want I take that (what I want I take that)
What I want I take that
Talk and get them grapes smashed
