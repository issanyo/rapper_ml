[Verse 1: Earl Sweatshirt (Sly Tendencies)]
Okay, let's be honest, truthfully
At the rate I'm moving you gone' have to get used to me
The sauce is the weakest, tang in my three-step
Often rejected cause I reject the reject

Garage Band flow needs no reason
And ya'll niggas taste less beef, no seasonin'
See foods eatin' them, proceed to the exit
Ends with an L-Y starts with an S, yes

Him without a win is Clark
Kent without a cleft chin
Superman reference
(Ahaha) keep steppin'

Yeah, I go harder than standardized testin'
Bars on lock my development's arrested
I'm the bestest, on a bad day I spit asbestos
Yeah it’s impressive ya’ll steady coming in second

Fuck V-necks, I'm the rapper to invest in
My flow ends recessions fresh as Crest breath is


[Interlude: Earl Sweatshirt (Sly Tendencies)]
Yeah, vibe with it
Uh, yeah (it feels good)
Gimme some time, gimme some time
Uh, yeah, verse 2
Here we go, here we go
Yeah, uh


[Verse 2: Earl Sweatshirt (Sly Tendencies)]
The revolution, I am Sly: kid ruthless
The booth's no spoofing, I spit it like I'm toothless
Food for the youth while the rest stay fruit
When lies become truth I drop shit like pollution

Stop the fools quick, no problem no solution
Ya' crew could sleep in the freezer an' still wouldn't be cool kids
Cruisin' in the music with the attitude of two kids
Hammerin' these babblin' niggas, respect my two cents

I could give two shits, let alone a dollar
My flows make bros go: "Whoa! Ho, say holla!"
Whack niggas say na'da, the best I'm a synonym
Still my pockets slim like the Olsen Twins

An' I'm mister quick, digits, and Miss dis-mis
And I'm quickenin' my sentences, Oliver Twist
Like Charles Dickens, Death Wishin' competition
But listen, the plot thickens, I'm a stand up guy

Well hell why am I sittin'?
