[Verse 1]
Gorgeous chrome-plated horse whip
Home-making paintings from poor quality porn flicks
Court adjourned and the verdict's still saucy
Sack swaying like Dub-D40 on a door hinge
Good lord walk light like the floor slick
Look bored hoard all mics in a force grip
Pro-abortion endorsing his own importance and
Leaving opponents floating with paper in dirty porcelain
Pinnacle of titillating crisp spit
Fist clinched emulating '68 Olympics
Rock it from the cradle 'til he middle aged and limp sticked
Coughing from the stank will probably indicate a spliff's lit
Dismissed, feel it in that saturated cranium..
