[Verse 1: Remy Banks]
Swerving in a hoopty, but a nigga not drunk
I'm high off of life, with a pinch of skunk
Maybe high off of determination, but I'm low on luck
Because we've been putting on for years, and people still be counting sheep on us
But its cool, I be that offspring dressed in all wolf clothing
With a mallet and a bell, just awaiting a rude awakening
Out here yellin Worlds Fair until the name ring
Hailing from a place where every nigga wanna be king
Plus this world is too cold, so I keep myself circle small
Puffing chronic with my dogs, chilly, but we holding down the city
And my burrow, feelin unstoppable like Tetsuo
Akira in the membrane Queens get the money
Yet I'm broke and going insane, stressed out my brain
Til it left on a train to Connecticut for the weekend
Might extended stay until I'm diving in the deep end
Of a pool full of euros, pounds, and yen, let's get this money, man

[Hook: Domo Genesis]
L said it's cold in this world, sometimes it's hard for me to crack a smile
That real shit is going out of style
These young niggas out here acting buck wild
We just need that real shit right now
L said it's cold in this world, somehow it's hard for me to crack a smile
That real shit is going out of style
These young niggas out here acting buck wild
They just need that real shit right now

[Verse 2: Domo Genesis]
For what it's worth, a nigga made his way from the dirt
All the times I went berserk, all ideas that didn't work
But we cherish when we hurt, we finished dinner and dessert
For every thought that hurt for the piece that I deserve I'm on the search
Many times a nigga felt that he would give in
Every dream that I would witness with previous premonitions
I knew that I would be this
It's never been a secret took a genius to believe it or an elitist to achieve it
I'm runnin overheated, but practice what I'm preachin
Never sleep and we catch you slippin and throw you in the deep end
I know some niggas died over pride, high
I know some fake niggas claim they ride, that's a lie
I know some hating niggas that when I rhyme, they despise
Wish I could share these visions through eyes
High like a fucking revolutionary
I'm droppin knowledge, and its only knowledge you should carry
Bitch, I'm the truth and everybody know the truth is scary

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Earl Sweatshirt]
Looking for shit to scratch up off this bucket list
Found a tug of war between my mother and my fucking friends
Fucking bucket, bumping nothing in the summer
Trying to chug a fifth of Jack in case you wondering where the ruckus went
I kept in the baggie of Oregano
Fronting like I'm selling dope, stunting with my effort low
Let the records show these niggas why they bitches neck is swole
It's OFM to the death of us, pigs, try to hem us up
The best wrestler's back guzzling seconds up
Using label checks to fuck around in the Cressida
And I'm advocating aggression
To any man who would test us, an avid fan of the presence of vodka
This drink is like my first time hearing Flocka
Hope is what the weed can't offer
Cheap ass, coughing, C-class method actor, young nigga
Dressing like I'm geriatric, said it's very active
Strong arm, steady swearing I could tear a mattress
Track-slapping 'em silly as Tom and Jerry tactics
Why you started? I fire harder than every rapper
Gassing these fairies, dare I say that he carry matches?

[Interlude: Hodgy Beats]
Hey, you think it’s a god damn joke, don’t you?
Well, let me tell you something boy!
It’s life around here, and in life, you’re gonna have to go to school…

[Hook]

[Verse 4: Hodgy Beats]
No confusion apparent, I know who I am
Responsibility enables me to move through life with agility
Home donors, pressure in the endzone, but I breeze by skillfully
Practice makes perfect said the wise man, or so his whole life span
They said a man was part of the sea
By hand, what? could he divide land?
Coast West like a took a Vyvanse, I'm just a bystander
And what you capture in my stanzas is a crossbreed
OG and banana
A jealous man I envy, cause a jealous man is friendly
Award him like a Grammy, or rather Emmy
Television all science, and music is just enough to ear a Q-tip
Where the proof sits that smells like bull shits
Ain't it a shame when a nigga can't be honest?
And it's whats-her-name that can't keep a promise
Mind is with my Comcast
Watching what I do before it's on them dot-coms and hastags, nigga
