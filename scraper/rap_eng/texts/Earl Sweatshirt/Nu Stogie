[Intro: Earl Sweatshirt]
Yuh yuh yuh yuh yuh yuh
Shit, you wanna hand me that fucking lighter? (Ight)
(No? Whatever, yeah yeah yeah)
No? (Alright)

[Verse 1: Earl Sweatshirt]
Uh (Bah), I am the shooter (Bah) reloaded
Who only move with the motive (Aye) to kill it
Music is coca, know that I roast it and flip it
It's nothing
Sniffling hoes accustomed to dick in they throat
I bust on the tip of they noses (Ya need a napkin or something?)
Just use this stack of this money (Okay)
I only laugh cause it's funny (Uh huh)
Whip an ass and rap with laxative tummy, shit
And I need that wall plastered with them plaques and that cash in abundance
Catch me on 'Fax with a couple cancer sticks
Hit me for cold and passion
Ain't loving ho, only khakis I'm cuffing
Little man with no manners, bitch I am actually dusty
Action Los Angeles, them bastards pack them Pacquiao punches
Pressed on your back for your bluffing
Let's take it back to the ruckus, bitch

[Chorus: Earl Sweatshirt]
Tell momma that her son on a mission
And I ain't seen the motherfucking sun in a minute
Gunning with that trouble in that come with the quickness
Say it's one for the money, nigga
Run for your riches, nigga
Tell my momma that her son get it, get it
I'ma crunch niggas, getting money
Blunts in the Civic, without fuck how you feeling nigga
(Fuck nigga, fuck how you feeling nigga)
Nigga, give a fuck how you feeling, nigga
Fuck with a nigga, nigga

[Verse 2: Earl Sweatshirt]
I am the soulless who coldest creaks in the winter
Rolling splinter deep and itching for bitches' dentals to denim
Then puffing loud and come in Fallon
Believe that Tec is offensive
You need a vest when you snitching
In Adidas sweat, I'ma kill 'em all (All)
That pussy wet, raining cats and doggies up out of her
I reach into the register, take the paper up out of it
Hate the fake and the talkative
Shake and bake, I'm the opposite
Frosted Flakes and a pot of grits
Percolating that breakfast
I'm dropping cake on a necklace
Spitting like a nigga just took a piss in my beverage
That Swisher sit on the dresser, split
Fingers twisting, decking and standing shit where the peasants sit
Mouse with the weapons
They come to fuck off your cheddar, bitch

[Chorus: Earl Sweatshirt]
Tell momma that her son on a mission
And I ain't seen the motherfucking sun in a minute
Gunning with that trouble in that come with the quickness
Say it's one for the money, nigga
Run for your riches, nigga
Tell my momma that her son get it, get it
I'ma crunch niggas, getting money
Blunts in the Civic, without fuck how you feeling nigga (Nigga)
Nigga, give a fuck how you feeling, nigga
Fuck with a nigga, nigga

[Outro: Stoney Willis]
Don't be so much confusion
Does you feel me?
It can hold you back
Yeah, I can't fuck with you
I'm just tryna get this money (Tryna get this money)
Niggas talking about some bullshit
Uh
What'd I say? Get away from me [?]
I don't need that anymore
It's money
The more you know
I can't fuck with you niggas, nigga
It's money (It's money, it's money)

[Silence]
