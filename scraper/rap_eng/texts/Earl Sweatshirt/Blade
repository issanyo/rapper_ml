[Verse: Earl Sweatshirt]
Sweatshirt, Domo Genesis, throwin' chairs, killin' shit
I'm half-privileged, think white and have nigga lips
A tad different, mad smart, act ignorant
Shit, I'll pass the class when my dad starts givin' shits
But as long as our relationship is turdless
I'ma keep burning rubber and fucking these beats with burnt dick
Who that, oh, that new coon John Cusack
A Mecca button-up, shoutin' bring Fubu back
Hands full of coke, mouth full of crack mu-zack
Odd Future on the doo-rag, guess who's back
With no hint, we're egging with no tint
Plus it's a shotgun under the seat where your ho sits, uh
The Night Striker, I'm riding her, up-tying her
It's nine Vicodins stuck inside of the windpipes of her
A little bit of sherm sure provokes the fuckin' fight in her
She started bitin' cause I'm givin' cock like it's advice to her
Take that, I'm on top like wave caps
This is grade-A rap, Domo bring that bass back, nigga

[Outro: Earl Sweatshirt & Tyler, the Creator]
Earl: Uhm, Domo couldn’t be here so uh… we’re just… I don’t like talking. UGH!
Tyler: Awww, cuz fell on the floor cuz! Aye, call them policemen niggas that like help people when they hurt!
