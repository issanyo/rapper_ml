[Verse]

Look, it's all pen, it's all for real niggas
It's gone in a song, it's still with us
It feel different
My heart [?] will in it
Bars ain't my only meal ticket
Regardless, I'm in a field, nigga
It's all pen, it's all-- I twist the spliff with both hands
Bitches heard about a nigga, so they hollering for mo'
And getting with the program
I think i feel my body getting cold and I ain't bring a clothe'
I'm walking like an old man
And look at all the shit I do to cope with shit
I do the most when I get on the ropes and
Still think I'm 'bout to hit the dope man
My nigga if I'm walking talking 'bout four grams
You gon' have me walking with whole bags
This bitch is sitting [?] on a coast tan
Bucket swerved and stopping for no man
We back in service, pack your shit up
Taxidermy rapping niggas for fun
My past determined what's finna come
My nigga skip the sermon, pass me the blunt
I knew the verdict 'fore the gavel went up
I know i judged you early back at the jump
