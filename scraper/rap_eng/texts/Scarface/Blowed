[Verse 1: Berner]
Can you picture money comin' in from every angle
Left Miami with one of Taz's angels
Venezuelan, pretty skin, and her eyes are hazel
Smoked out, with a stripper, stage name is Angel
White leather inside, coke white mayo
I used to send O.G. P's in the mail
I'm in the Crestside, with my cuddies in Vallejo
Choppin' game, Bay business over everything
I lost loved ones, I'm tryna' smoke away the pain
The paint drip like the coke when the powder drain
Hopped off the plane and then a hundred sours came
Move 'em all, we're in a drought in the Fall
In my stones not a flaw, make baby work her jaw
Does she smoke, can she roll a raw
She with the shit or naw
Money over bitches, yeah, but my girls pay cash
Light yellow hash, yeah, and jet fuel gas

[Hook: Berner & B-Real]
[Berner]
Cherry Pie, Samurai
We smoke like that
Jet fuel, Lemon Tree
Yeah, we roll like that
Head stash look crazy
Y'all don't hold like that
I'm so blowed, blowed, blowed
[B-Real]
Hard fuel, Girl Scout
Yeah, we smoke like that
Tropicana-ana Sherb
Yeah, we roll like that
Got a tangerine slab
You don't hold like that
I'm so blowed, blowed, blowed

[Verse 2: Scarface]
Spendin' many days plottin' hows we gonna get it
And once we finally got it, how was we gonna spend it
I don't need no limit
Bein' broke don't cut it
This is money over everything, loco, so fuck it
I'm gon' push my bucket, every goddamn day
I'm a mission to knock me off that goddamn rave
Light up that goddamn J, get my smoke on vibe
Take me two or three pulls, and ge me oh so high
My nigga B grow farm, Berner joints gonna hit
Cali love, California cable, jet fuel, bitch
My nigga, take your pick, this is all I know
I been down too long, so comin' up is all I know
This is all I want, we so laid back
In the mind-state of fuck the world, got wax
Get it? Y'all got wax
Figured y'all caught that
The Snowman and Cookies, y'all don't roll like that
Y'all ain't know about that

[Verse 3: B-Real]
Got them big packs and we make stacks and we shine hard
Yeah, we laid back and they hate that and they mind scarred
We upper echelon, with the session on, no fear at all
Bitch, what you stressin' on?
The impression you get, we take 'em all
Let me know what you got, is you crying bitches
We got tissues
Fallen soldiers in the weed war
You know you hate us, they don't miss you
We got your mind-state fucked up now
And it's ten past seven
But you want time-out, and frustrated, can't hit that lemon
The flavor was greater, savor the flower
The doctor and Berner would relate to
Shit is so major, behavior is all to the minute you hit it
We fade you
Bern got that bomb fire, that's no manner
We smoke mix and you bitch asses try to hang
But you end up another burned victim
The doctors orders, had a quarter round
It's every two hours, every fuckin' day
If you run out, better my call nurses
They'll bring a pack, it's all CA
From top to bottom, call me on the dime
I got a farm with some weed on it
Don't worry, I'mma learn to doctor
I'm in practice, no seed on it
