[Verse 1]
Miss me? Wished me?
Well I am done now
Won't be coming back again
I'll let you run wild!
Smile for the camera
Pose for a snap shot
This will be the last tape
I'm about to cash out
Fun while it lasted
Maybe in the next life
I can be ya girlfriend
'cus i don't need an ex wife
They tell me that beauty's only skin deep
Inside empty, pissed off simply
Cause I will not apologize
For nothing I done did wrong
Bitch you done chose me, you are gonna win some
And lose some, that's just a couple thang
Fine if it works
If it don't, that's another ring
Sold to the highest bidder, my nigga
Ho had a nerve to tell a mama I hit her
Never had to, that is not true
Now I got another boo thang, that is not you!

[Hook]
Let us fly to the heart
It's a fight for love
? ?
I don't know, I don't know
I'm so lost, so lonely
Where she going, where she going?
It feels like I'm in pain
I'm lonely, I'm lonely

[Verse 2]
I don't wanna play the blame game
Nah, that's not me
I can pack my own bags
No use tryna stop me
I got my mind made
A spade is a spade, ma'
You took what we had
And made it bad, what's the spade now?
Relationship is gone
Ain't no heart here
Just a ice box where it was
If it's not clear
Let me make it for you
We are over, find another
Ain't no use in trying to reason
With this stupid motherfucker
I never shoulda trust her
It was dirty from the jumpstreet
You wanted the rapstar
You ain't really want me
Settle for a anybody
Shit you done was idiotic
You thought I was broke, huh?
Bitch I'm gettin plenty money
That shit is really funny
You gave me the 10 count?
You threw in the towel on me
Then brought that Benz out
You at your friends house
Booed up with some dude?
With pictures on your instagram
Smiling with it, fuck you

[Hook]
Let us fly to the heart
? ?
I'm so lost, so lonely
Where she going, where she going?
It feels like i'm in pain
I'm lonely, i'm lonely

[Verse 3]
Hey it's a new me
I hope you found new you
And got your shit together
I ain't mad baby, do you
There's plenty other dudes to fall in lust with
For holidays, or any other days
That you put yo trust in
You're a must win
Losing ain't a option
You don't wanna work
You wan't the finer things, stop this
You ain't no better than the next bitch begging
Can't pour piss out of them boots you put your legs in?
And even wanna fairytale wedding
Like a nigga wanna wife you
And I don't even like you
Love gone, how am i gonna write a love song?
I'm wishing you the best, but he fucked you with a glove on!
Girl gone, how nice of you to stop by
Bitch that you accused me of sleeping wit is my wife now
Let me be nice now
Here's the introducion
Misses Jordan
He's just stupid bitch that i was fucking

[Hook]
Let us fly to the heart
? ?
I'm so lost, so lonely
Where she going, where she going?
It feels like i'm in pain
I'm lonely, i'm lonely
