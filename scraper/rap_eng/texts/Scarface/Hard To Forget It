[Hook]
See I was out there going hard, moving work with my niggas
By all means got to get it
Seen the concrete jungle turn niggas into urban gorillas
And it’s hard to forget it
I said it’s hard to forget it, when you’re out there playing the game
Chasing fortune and fame, I say it’s hard to forget it
All the homies we done lost at war
No we can’t see you no more
It’s just hard to forget it
All my niggas doing life in the pen, that won’t see daylight again
I know it’s hard to forget it
Wish I could show you all this shit on my brain
So much pleasure and pain, it’s just hard to forget it

[Verse 1 – Boaz]
Now as I open up my memory bank
Take a minute to think
Take a sip of this drink
I’m reminiscing on my upbringing
Mad early we be up slinging
We stopped fist fighting and started gun slinging
Little young nigga toting all the latest issues
And his aim official, raise it up and make it whistle
Nigga’s parents be quick to call me a menace
Cause I said when I grew older I wanted to be a chemist
Start my own business, right in front the store
Had to draw the 44 out on old man Willis
Make him feel us, now gangsters make the world go round
That’s till they kill us or the cops come get us

[Hook]

[Verse 2 – Scarface]
My nigga doing life now
All because he wanted the lifestyle
Of a nigga off in them videos
Fucking bitches and slamming [?]
Never thinking about the consequences
He got money and started punking niggas
That’s when I had to have that talk with him
He wouldn’t listen, and let the law get him
I understand a nigga do wrong
To get back on they feet, but when you on em
That’s when you gone
And move on, cause greed’ll get your head bust
You niggas looking at you like you fucked up
Ain’t no [?]
You at his woman when your boy leaves
She’s only loyal to the streets though
Money makes her world, fuck a G’s soul

[Hook]

[Verse 3 – Boaz]
They just talk about it, guess who live it nigga
My money got tall from selling pounds of midget nigga
This shit come from the heart, I know you feel it nigga
Fresh out the cockpit, flyer than Scott [?] nigga
I got to smoke the best weed and fuck the baddest hoes
Fuck a rabbit foot I’m tryna catch a camel toe
I’m sick of cutting up keys and bagging O’s
They profile a nigga because of my baggy clothes
Gold chain, pinky ring, icy watches
That’s boss shit
I could invite you by the office
Never out hustle, out muscle, or out flosses
But think about it
This fast life gon cost us
