Verse 1

Love! I can’t say it’s easy to explain/
But, I have eyes fer her. anyway/

Tho I'm mature enough, can't resist the lure/
Of big eyes, the face with no make up, for shur/

If we make love there is gonna be no lack/
But when I see you I dunno how to act /
Matter fact when I make eye contact /
That’s a test how you are gonna react /

Your tomato cheeks are delicious and so crazy /
Exactly when your roses lips smile at me /
Your honeyed voice is sweet like a sugar candy/
Watching you can only make me happy /

My lady you are special and something else/
Nobody can guess how pretty my baby is /
Lily you are the best the best, you made me impressed /
With your long hair mess, girls’ things and pretty dress /

Verse 2

These little birds are heralding a spring /
Look n listen how beautiful they sing /
You are the most gorgeous girl, I’ve ever seen/
And I'm also hooked on you fer one thing /

You are the one who make my life complete /
The reason why I spit bars over this love beat /
You  r my soul mate. the god’s masterpiece /
Your cute face makes my heart b b beat /

I fell head over heels at the first sight /
Baby girl I’m smitten with your love light /
Been thinking bout you all these nights /
Been thinking why he created you so nice /

If the sky is dark to your eyes /
I’ll shine bright as moonlight and stars /
Why r u trying to hide your scares? /
Trust me , because one can not love n be wise/
