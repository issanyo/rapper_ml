[Verse 1: Devin the Dude]
I break down the sweets
And I roll them hoes like two by fours
Fire it up, take a pull
And run that ho up through my nose
Take a couple more
And then it goes to my friends
When it's gone
I start the whole process all over again
Every night and day the same thing
Brain stays blowed
You got some weed to smoke
It seems I can't say no
But we don't need no water
Let that motherfucker burn
And take two pulls and pass man
Its that other brother's turn
Cuz you know I love coffee
Can't keep the smell off me
Nigga this some killa
Better pull on it softly
And don't be babysittin'
With the weed man hit it
Cuz the faster you pass it man
The faster you get it

Nah the faster you hit it
The faster you fly
Pass that sweet to the right
And don't keep passin' it by
Now I can't lie
But I love gettin' high
Sleepy eyes
Smoking sweets until the day that I die
Don't ask me why
I love the essence of your presence
Never fall when im wreckin'
In the circle mic checkin
I use the sweet as my weapon
No disrespect
But I'm a fiend for the wood
Its all good
Take another pull
Pass that shit cuz I'm full

[Verse 2: Jugg Mugg]
Can I smoke witcha
Yes you can!
All you gotta do is come
And put it in the jug's hand
Let the coffee circulate
And pass it straight to my brothas
Whoever possess the sess
Nigga we share with each other
You holdin' the swet
Why you runnin' your fuckin' mouth
Constantly movin' your lips
Without no smoke comin' out
'Cause the mic is like a sweet
You hit it hard and pass it on
So I gotsta make sure
That the blow ? is gone

Ain't nothing better than
A fresh bag of weed up in the mornin'
Before I'm gone
Twist that shit up and ?
So what you coffee brother need not askin
You besta be bout passin
I done seen tons of weed turn to ash
?
Oxygen 3 for 10
I do it all over again
In an effort to leave my skin
Now if I can't afford it ima ?
All about your ?
Highways and better days
Illustrate ?

And these niggas on the other side
Think they gettin' high

That any nigga steppin' gettin' blown
And it's cool like that

'Cause it don't stop
And it don't quit
Until I say it's over wit'
Fuck the dumb shit
Fire up the weed
Gimme what I need
So I can proceed
To hit your ass up high speed
Loose, loose, and I get loose

So I can fuck up shit
And make these niggas
Feel like I was Steve Austin
The bionic man
Smokin gettin' high as I can
Getting layed out
