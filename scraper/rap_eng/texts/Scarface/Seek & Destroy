[Verse 1: Scarface (as D.J. Akshen)]
Yo, let's find the competition so I can destroy the
Wack MC's who think they're headed for stardom
They think Ak can't subtract the card
But I will come back, wax and tax the punk
Bought back the track that was large, I kept, these suckers are gone
D.J. Akshen is back and D.J. Akshen is hard
Put rhymes together are clever, tougher than leather however
MC's are tropical feather, don't claim to battle, I'm better
MC's'll die by the dozen, said they was dope but they wasn't
Now I'm tellin' you cousin, get off my jock, cause you buggin'
Got a rhyme let's get to it, gave you a chance but you blew it
You fell a geek an I knew it, Akshen is back so don't do it
See, I perfected perfection, give me some time, just a second
So I can rhyme my selection, my rhymes is burning protection
You see I've seen and I saw a lot of fiends on the draw
Tryin' to get with the king, cool out the king's on the floor
It's time to cool and I chill, it's time to school and I kill
And when you're down for the feel, just let me know and I will
Come around for the brawl, some MC's bank but I roar
They crumble up like toy
Because my mission is to seek and destroy

[Verse 2: Scarface]
Here it comes, the voice of the invincible
You're gettin' dumb, come now, let's be sensible
You couldn't hang with the mastermind of wrecking shit
So get a grip and come equipped
Cause I'mma show the real meaning of a massacre
A mad man, disaster cause Ak is the
Great one, I'll never 'fess unless the best
Push the great to the test and I'ma just
Watch 'em crumble up just like the leaves in December
Cut em tough and yell "timber!"
And after the path is clear I stand
The immortal survivor Akshen
I can't be stopped cause I'm gonna rock until you drop
So full of action that you'll get dizzy then you'll pop
I'm a mastermind and not a toy
And my mission is to seek and destroy

[Verse 3: Scarface]
I come equipped, ready for a rhyme war
MC's get flipped one at at time or a
In flocks and flees, the punks you beat, they can't compete
Don't try to make me slip, I don't sleep
I'll break and take the fake who claimed to make the place
To dominate 'cha mate from state to state
Away from the states you make and then begin to ache the head
More like an earthquake
Lyrics begin to penetrate, to spin, the wind that breaks
The skin, you evaporate
That's when I'ma have to make a jam to hold my own
Because Ak control the zone of rap, step off, I'm on the microphone
If you test the best go check arrests and ask the press
How many heads were put to rest
And Ak gon' just get moet and hit the sess
And still be posing a threat
Cause I'm the mastermind and not a toy
And my mission is to seek and destroy

[Verse 4: Scarface]
Let me continue or should I say finish this?
This is a dope jam, though some are wishin' this
Will be the last that ya heard of the Ak
But I'll be back to attack on another track
But until then you all follow the dream
Peace! Now let me hear ya scream

[Outro: Scarface]
Eh Yo Red, cut that up real funky for me, you know what I'm saying?
Cause this is the Geto Boys dope jam of '89
Rockin' it all the way into the '90s
And to the entire Rap-a-Lot family
D Ak and the Geto boys say "Peace"
Ha Ha
