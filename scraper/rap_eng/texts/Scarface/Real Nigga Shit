FaceMob in the house
GB
Chuck Nice
Willie D y'all
Uh-huh
I guess I'll open it up
Y'know?

[Scarface]
It's on, ring the alarm
Got a full metal jacket and the P7 I'm clutchin in my palm
When the first shot ring out, the last man standin
Be the last man they bring out, ain't nobody starin
Niggas is gettin somewhere they know the gunner ain't for play
He got some niggas in the parkin lot sparkin off the AK
So rat-tat-tat, tat 'til yo' ass hit the motherfuckin flo'
What that FaceMob lookin like ho?
You want drama, I'mma send it at you full speed pussy
The last of this motherfuckin species, push me
When it's on end your life, fuck who wrong you was right
You the nigga center stage, better go and get a stripe
Cause tonight, you fucked with big dawgs but they bite
Now I'm at you with a vengeance nigga, go and grab the mic
I don't threaten motherfuckers in the booth, I'm the truth
I was out there in the hood, nigga where the fuck was you?

[Hook 2X: Scarface]
I'm quick to introduce niggas to real nigga shit
I don't bullshit with niggas, I kill niggas quick
Face the motherfuckin facts, you a rapper I'm a killer
I'm respected in these streets cause I'm a real-ass nigga

[Willie D]
I don't pay too much attention, to a nigga with lip
As long as the dawg barkin, he can't bite shit
They got yo' record in the store you fuckin clown
They got my motherfuckin record downtown
Stop crook, everybody know you mushy
You transparent, and I can see you pussy
Pussy, pussy pussy, up in your drawers
All you need is some weed and alcohol
Bitch niggas get dusted, I'm here to stay so get adjusted
If I can see it, I can bust it
You can round up every motherfucker you know
But when the time say so, I'mma get wit'chu ho
I know you prayin that protection talk gon' get you saved
But nigga you ain't doin nuttin but diggin your grave
And you talk about that gangsta shit, it's so funny
If a nigga think you real, I'm the motherfuckin Easter Bunny
All that bullshit you talkin I don't buy all that
I hit yo' ass in the head with a car jack
Rat-a-tat tat 'til your dick-suckin ass twitch
Now what that Willie D lookin like, bitch?

[Hook]

[Bushwick Bill]
Now which one of y'all niggas got beef with me?
Ain't none of y'all motherfucker more street than me
Y'all some ho-ass niggas, Mo'-ass niggas
Mario Winans "I Don't Wanna Know" ass niggas
Too timid to check a ho-ass niggas
Washin dishes and moppin the flo' ass niggas
Meet 'em on the po'ch, shut the do' ass nigga
Fo'-fo' calico totin ass niggas
Fuck with Bushwick, and watch your push get
Pushed back to the white meat, motherfucker
No doubt we pack heat, motherfucker
Lift yo' ass off your feet motherfucker
FaceMob make music to driveby to
Fuck with me I'll have you lookin at what I do
Now listen to a real nigga spit
A small introduction to some real nigga shit
