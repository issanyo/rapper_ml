Far in the distance is cast a shadow
Symbol of out freedom will bring us salvation
On the horizon hope for tomorrow
Sweeping across the land to give us unity
Look to the heavens with tears of triumph
To cherish a new life and suffer not again
Lift up our spirits from all destruction
Never shall we return from conflict we must learn
