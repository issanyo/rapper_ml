I came with a 4.6
Nah I'm strapped up
Nigga want some smoke
I let my choppa' hit his throat

Glaciers start to flood aye
Na they hit the boat!
Oh hell nah everybody get some coats

Ears shining like the sun aye
But they so cold boy
Just like the month

I'm savin' up (Fo wha?)
I'm savin' up this energy to blow up!

I mean it litterally
You cannot mess with me
I am so quiet
But boy I sting like a bee
Flow is so critical
Missing that lyrical
But I don't give a fuck
This superficial
Boy you want some real shi'
So I'm gonna gitve it to you
(Hol' up wait wha wha wha?!?!)
So I'm gonna give it to you

What i wanna say
Niggas needa' keep quiet like everyday
If they want some drama they can meet ma' llama
It free anyday

BITCH
