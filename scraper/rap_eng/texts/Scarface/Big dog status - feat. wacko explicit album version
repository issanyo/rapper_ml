[Verse: Scarface]
Young Face slangin, Ya Ya Ya
Heavyweight, Got a bad bitch in every state
On the grind, nonstop till I touch this cake
Mark ass niggas, stay the fuck up out my way
I be true O.G., you can quote what I say
I'm a H-town nigga from around the way
Southside, ridin' dirty like I'm UGK
Asshole by nature like my name was Tre
And I don't gangbang, I control the Game
What I'm representin' here's puttin' holes in brains
Oh, I say the same thing till I'm old and grey
For I falloff and rap about my clothes and chains
Grippin' grain and poppin' trunks, Dawg that ain't me
These elbows hit the scene back in '83
I stay street with it, dun asked that
You can find me in your hood pumpin' monster crack
I rollover rodents with rims on em
Sniffing out a rat, I expose them and then bend on em
I lotta bitches but they claiming they O.G.s
A straight up pussy, he claims he knows me
See I puttin out these VVdees
Let my shit hit the streets, he got to squat to pee
Got them eggs on these beams, so they watchin' me
Might trap for a rat, pussy watch and see

[Hook:]
I been straight for a long time
Gettin' checks for a long time
Gettin' Jake for a long time
E&J for a long time
Nigga, try to get like me
Been a G, for a long time
Been in the streets, for a long time
Toting heat, for a long time
Nigga, try to get like me
I got Big Dogg Status, I got Big Dogg Status
I got Big Dogg Status, I got Big Dogg Status
I got Big Dogg Status, I got Big Dogg Status
I got Big Dogg Status, I got Big Dogg Status
I came here to exercise my game
Swear love to the hood
That's how i do my thang
Smoke weed with my hommies
Bar-b-q them wangs
Sip hennisy and coke
See i don't fuck with drank
Hold out bill ski
Because that shit ain't cool
We just drunk a mad dog before we went to school
Way up back then i was smashing boys
Jump wrong you saw a nigga get his ass destroyed
Same shit right now
I demand respect
And if i slap one hoe than a man was next
I'm kick door robber
A hot shot driver
A crack rock slanging mother fucker for a dollar
If there's shit there to be made
Then I'm finna make it
But if ther ain't no way
Than I'm believe take it
Cause a nigga with no hustle is his worth is (gay?)
And a bitch like this is even worse then that
I'm a fool bullshiting what this game can cost
And if a nigga can't maintain than man he's lost
Being heard and they fuck nerds in jail i heard
And as a nigga i come in here with my balls word

[Hook:]
I been straight for a long time

I got Big Dogg Status, I got Big Dogg Status

I got Big Dogg Status, I got Big Dogg Status

Man on second thought the story is about boys
Running round talking bout how they ride these cars
I was sitting in these Benz at the age of 19
When i was 21 i had a yellow ferrari
22 i was portioned with a top at back
23 in a rose with the pipe to match
24 i wasn't tripping what i came up in
I was focussing on how to be like james back then
Wonder how respected was the life i chose
Being famous wasn't nothing i just liked my dough
I was living in the fast lane
Man for sho
Short temper quick to up let this thing unload
So if i had a problem with ya
Use a blanket no
Shaw the message then you see the nigga's brain exploads
So if you see a nigga chunk da doose as you see me ride by
