My heart cold like when the sea was frozen
Drug supplying and hold the iron like hemoglobin
Catch a body on whichever fuckin' beat is chosen
Murder the church, left the fuckin' cathedral open
Throw a left hook to the ribs leave em broken
Box game levitate 'em so that Jesus know 'em
Walk with God so everyone in Medina know him
Y'all are casual rappers I have a deep devotion
Speak when spoken to, bitch, you just a snake snitchin'
The D supplying, the fiends higher then Blake Griffin
I don't wanna hit the bitch but the dame trippin'
I call the shot on who move the rock like Lane Kiffin
I changed labels but implemented the same system
I had to walk through the fire so I could gain wisdom
I see life through the same eyes, same vision
The watch five figures, lord, and the chain glisten

If you wanna problem, Vinnie is a problem
And the problem is that I'm a motherfuckin' disease
I would never hesitate to pull the pistol out
I always got the problem solver with me
Makin' money over here makin' money there
Seein' places you could never possibly see
My crew thick I don't give two shits
You can suck my dick you should probably flee

I rap like there ain't shit to it I just do it
Light you simple niggas and check they ass when they sewage
Fuck you if you can't take a joke, shit
Smoke this. You broke bitch. Lack of focus get your nose bit
Light that ass up then I send you
On a mission impossible take flight with my pencil
As I enlighten you with shit I done been through
The complicated I done make it look simple
With one squeeze I leave they head with a dimple
And leaky like an old fat bitch on her menstrual
You rap style humble I'm still standing
As hard as they been making them these days I cans till win
Why the fuck you think they call me an OG?
The way I handle biz is nothing short of unholy
I'm ghostly on the block with my top up
Pistol in my lap you shot wrong you gettin' glocked up

If you wanna problem, Vinnie is a problem
And the problem is that I'm a motherfuckin' disease
I would never hesitate to pull the pistol out
I always got the problem solver with me
Makin' money over here makin' money there
Seein' places you could never possibly see
My crew thick I don't give two shits
You can suck my dick you should probably flee

The knife work nice, all day gentle carver
And I stay on point like a pencil sharpener
Matter fact, I'm on point like Tibetan archers
Move weight legislate like extended caucus
And I know how the game should be locked up
I know all the dope fiends veins will be popped up
I know that y'all claim to be stocked up
Gun work nice, all your brains will be mopped up
This beef rearrange your face like collagen
Cook jums on the same pot my mamma pasta in
I don't play games I just rock your chin
You fuck with cops? I never let the impostors in
See Vinnie give you a whole clip
I'm an artist, blood decorate the whole shit
Got knocked, almost did a bid in '06
I'm smarter now, that's why I conquered this whole shit

If you wanna problem, Vinnie is a problem
And the problem is that he a mutha-fuckin' disease
I would never hesitate to pull the pistol out
I always got the problem solver with me
Makin' money over here makin' money there
Seein' places you could never possibly see
My crew thick I don't give two shits
You can suck my dick you should probably flee
