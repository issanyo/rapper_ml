Had it all wanted more so you got you some fast cash to keep you rollin
Credit cards slit your throat now it won't let go
Yeah you've gotta get out before it takes control
It's a big black hole it'll swallow your soul

When greed is all that motivates
You'll hang yourself and seal your fate

And you'll go down swinging from an old tree
Suicide of the worst degree
It'll be too late to get yourself free
Cause you'll be too far down
Was it worth the betrayal that made you bleed
To get your silver to feed your greed
Oh it's a deadly so don't let it in

For what it's worth everything on the earth's not enough
To keep you going
What you want never need only fuels you're greed
Yeah, you gotta get out before it takes control
It's a big black hole that'll swallow your soul

When greed is all that motivates
You'll hang yourself and seal your fate

And you'll go down swinging from an old tree
Suicide of the worst degree
It'll be too late to get yourself free
Cause you'll be too far down
Was it worth the betrayal that made you bleed
To get your silver to feed your greed
Oh it's a deadly sin don't let it in

All the pennies in your pockets
Won't get you through the needles eye
The one thing that you're needing
Money just can't buy

And you'll go down swinging from an old tree
Suicide of the worst degree
It'll be too late to get yourself free
Cause you'll be too far down
Was it worth the betrayal that made you bleed
To get your silver to feed your greed
