[Intro: Belly]
Yeah
This for all my niggas in lockup
If you was convicted of something you didn't do
If you was wrongfully accused
If you was discriminated against, this is for you

[Hook: Belly]
I swear they wanna stop me
I swear they think they got me
They judge me then they lock me
I stand up they can't drop me
I swear they wanna stop me
I swear they think they got me
They judge me then they lock me
I stand up they can't drop me

[Verse 1: Belly]
We gotta pick ourselves up
Out here, nobody's tryna help us
That's why they try to jail us, blackmail us
Close the coffin keep the nails shut
Why I got the popo's hating, when I beat 3 cases
I ain't never had no probation
You'll never succeed if you don't show no patience
I remember the days when there was no rotation
We was leaving messaged nobody would call back
Now it's superstardom broads calls and all that
What I'm speaking is all fact I'm innocent
I went legit tell em all to fall back
I don't hesitate, I let em hate
You know you talking to a leather face I'll never break
They pull over the Escalades to check the plates
Don't you got rapes and murders to investigate?

[Hook: Belly]
I swear they wanna stop me
I swear they think they got me
They judge me then they lock me
I stand up they can't drop me
I swear they wanna stop me
I swear they think they got me
They judge me then they lock me
I stand up they can't drop me

[Verse 2: Scarface]
I swear that when I come up Ima put the hood down
Ima guarantee my niggas front 50 on every ounce
No more fronting the homies we fucking with major weight
And I swear, that when I get up on my feet we straight
I done stood on every corner moving work on the blocks
Got enemies I ain't never seen, so I'm shell shot
Got a Glock .45 and a holster on my side
And I'm prepared to put it down on anybody wanna die
I been down for too long my game too strong
To be a broke motherfucker, and Ima put that on
Everything I believe in, looks are deceiving
Just because a dog don't bite don't mean he teething
And I'm seasoning, I'm programmed to squeeze it
Fuck the 40 acres and the mule, we dyin over few, In this white man's world that's how they do
And most of my homies off in the hood off in this crew

[Hook: Belly]
I swear they wanna stop me
I swear they think they got me
They judge me then they lock me
I stand up they can't drop me
I swear they wanna stop me
I swear they think they got me
They judge me then they lock me
I stand up they can't drop me

[Verse 3: Belly]
I've been close to gone, seen death vividly
Speak my heart out, I guess that's what stress did to me
Now it's less freedom less liberty
No wonder jails is filled with ethnicity
This is the evolution without the education of
The youth the revolution of rap
The difference between illusion and fact
All they give us is rap, ball all future of crap
I swear to God the prison system is sick
Half the convicts, serve time for crimes they didn't commit
Gotta sleep where they piss and they shit
How can you judge them when God has forgiven their sins
Don't you ever let out, tear in my eyes is streaming
Screaming big home keep your head up
You wonder why I'm defending their rights?
You know how deeply this affected my life? Heyy

[Hook: Belly]
I swear they wanna stop me
I swear they think they got me
They judge me then they lock me
I stand up they can't drop me
I swear they wanna stop me
I swear they think they got me
They judge me then they lock me
I stand up they can't drop me
