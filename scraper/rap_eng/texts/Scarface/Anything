[Intro:]
For a dolla' bill people will do anything, they'd rob and steal for a dolla' bill, any will
Let's go sit back and let the beat ride a lil' bit
Let a m.f hear what is supposed to sound like ya' dig

[Verse 1:]
Yeah I'm from around the way, I slung about a oz a day
I'm living proof you ain't got no excuse
If it was there, it ain't got shit to lose
Dem' older cats would chunk a nigga fronts
Would rock it up and smoke that ish in blunts
For tennis shoes, we was getting' fools
We caught you slippin', we would get at you
With no respect, fu.. a nigga set
We shot it up and murk his connects
What yours is mine for a dolla sign
I blame the grind, I was outta line
I'm reminiscing on what niggas did
For big rewards, you took a bigger risk
They say what comes around and go around
And when you least expect the ish be goin' down

[Chorus:]
Gotta' get it how I live, that's how the streets raised me
And for that paper most niggas do, anything, anything
A silent dude, so that's how a move I'm a street made nig
Not trying to lose, so I gotta do anything, anything

[Verse 2:]
They called it murder in the first degree
And it was then that it occurred to me
This was some inside ish
That was your friend got hit huh
They knew all about the stash spot
Knew where the money was and cashed out
You got the nerve to act like you don't know
When all the while you steady gettin mo'
Just remember dude we watchin' you
I spared your life they day they shot at you
Cause if I didn't, they was coming back to finish off yo a
You a walkin' dead and it's a fact
You slimey niggas play the game wrong
Get popped, can't do they time so they sang songs
I turned the game on Watch the Nicks play
I sent them shottas at you're a cuz u a b made nigga

[Chorus]

[Verse 3:]
Real nigga in your presence
Money couldn't change me past or the present
Homey I'm the essence Tote a smith and western
Eyes hella tiny in the hood is where you find me
Out here with the grimey b wanna come up
Niggaa slangin'Snow packs ,nose running from 'em
Let you get your mind right, money on that weed though , baby on them molly whops blinded by the weed smoke We come from them streets ho, I stay on that ignant' ish
Ain't nothing 'bout week ho ,always game to stomp a bi  and stomp a bi.., and stomp a bi got super boxing' game so I prefer to punch a bitch mission accomplished 
Put me up against whatever I am busting it
A nucca's born hustlin' and tustlin and struggling and musclin' just making you aware who you fucking with
