Underground Master speaking
[Lil J]
Yo D, what's up?
[Willie D]
Just chillin man, what's up?
[Lil J]
Give them Geto Boys a ring, man
[Willie D]
OK, hold em down

[Scarface]
Geto Boys...
[Lil J]
Hey
[Scarface]
What's up J
[Lil J]
Yeah man, I got Willie D on the other end, man
[Scarface]
What's up Will?
[Willie D]
What's up now, what's up fellas?
[Scarface]
We just kickin it, coolin

[Lil J]
Say fellas...
I been kickin a few lyrics in the back of my mind, man
And I'm tired of people disrespecting us
Because we're black-owned and won't sell out
(Word)
So check this out
We need to get together
And go to that other level of the game
And do it like a G.O

[Scarface]
Say no more, J, we're on the telephone, man
[Willie D]
We get message
[Lil J]
Well, let's make em an offer they can't refuse...

[Bushwick Bill]
I'm back like a rebel 'making trouble'
I'm an Assassin, kickin ass on the double
No motherfucker alive's gonna stop me
So fuck you and your goddamn posse

[Willie D]
It's time to step on some motherfuckin toes
(Nah D!) Man, fuck them hoes
The East Coast ain't playin our songs
I wanna know what the hell's goin on
Gimme my card, radio sucker
I'll kick your ass and take the motherfucker
Everybody know New York is where it began
So let the ego shit end

[Scarface]
Black radio is being disowned
Not by the other race, but its own
A lot of bullshit records make hits
Because the radio is cash doing politics
Akshen is my identity, whoever you be
(Don't) (don't) (don't fuck with me)
My last go, the radio struck me with a low blow
Now I'm doin it like a G.O

(Go, go, go, go, go...)

(Let's make em an offer they can't refuse

(Go, go, go, go, go...)

(You wanna go to war? We'll take you to war, okay?)

[Willie D]
Everybody's coming with guns
Niggas gettin pimped by Colombians
They put 'em on the streets like a bitch
Nigga's slangin but the Puerto-Rican gettin' rich
I never sold the mess
But if I did, it would be for my-goddamn-self
Can you adjust to the wholesale bust
Bushwick, tell these motherfuckers what's up

[Bushwick Bill]
When will you stupid motherfuckers learn
In this game one way or another you get burned
You end up behind bars
Or lyin on your back in a motherfuckin morgue
And your gal'll find another nigga
Cause the low-actin bitch ain't nothin but a golddigger
I'll fuck her but my money is a no-no
(Why?) I'm a ho so I do it like a G.O

(Go, go, go, go, go...)

(Let's make em an offer they can't refuse

(Go, go, go, go, go...)

(You wanna go to war? We'll take you to war, okay?)

[Scarface]
Fucked up politics
Those tie-wearin bitches can suck my dick
They try to ban my style of teachin
But freedom of speech allow me to keep speakin
To the people about shit like racism
It's deep into the heart of the school system
Whites get more funds from the state
And this is why minorities learn so late

[Willie D]
Some of us make it to college
And take a test to the highest degree with limited knowledge
Most of us won't pass the bitch
And those rotten-ass motherfuckers know this
I'm not Malcolm X or Farrakhan
After this one, I'll guess I'll have to pack a gun
So if you wanna fuck with this brother
You better be ready, motherfucker
You're gonna have to G.O

(Go, go, go, go, go...)

(Let's make em an offer they can't refuse

(Go, go, go, go, go...)

(You wanna go to war? We'll take you to war, okay?)

[Willie D]
Willie D is not a biggot and he won't be
I just educate minds through reality
This ain't no motherfuckin 'back to Africa'
Try to pull that shit, we'll have a massacre

[Scarface]
Our ancestors were killed at will
Bought and sold like a used automobile
We fought back to race they our color?

[Lil J]
Never Again Motherfuckers

[DJ Ready Red]
Ready Red, comin at ya
Holdin my ground like a motherfuckin statue
You take nothin from me, so stop trippin
'less you wanna take a motherfuckin ass whippin
Bitch, motherfuck the KKK
Wearin dresses and shit, what the fuck, is they gay?

[Willie D]
A colorblind society we'll never be
Unless we agree (in harmony)
To do it like a G.O

['President of White-Owned Records']
Hey Jay, this is the President of White Owned Records
We see you're still survivin
But wanted to ask you to keep your Willie D And The Geto boys quiet
If you don't, we will
Or here's another alternative
We take 95% of your company and you take 5
And we'll make you famous within 15 years
It would take you lifetime by yourself
Because you know your people don't stick together
What you say about that, boy?
[Lil J]
Man, fuck you
['President of White-Owned Records']
I would advise you not to talk to me like that, boy
Just who the hell you think you are anyway?
[Lil J]
Just Call Me Lil J
I ain'ts to be Played with
And if you wanna go to war, I'll take you to war
