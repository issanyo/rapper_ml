[Verse]
Somebody said you bumped your head
And bled the floor
Jumped into a pit of flames
And burned to coal

[Pre-Chorus]
Drowned inside the lake outside
Away you flow
And this I know

[Chorus]
City girl
You're still breathing
You're still breathing
City girl
You're still breathing
You're still breathing
Still breathing

[Post-Chorus]
Still breathing
Still breathing
Still breathing
