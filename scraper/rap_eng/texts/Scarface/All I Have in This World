[Intro: Mannie Fresh & (Rick Ross)]
Okay, I'm reloaded (Ain't expect this)
The homey, Elvis Freshly (Uh, Huuh) and Rick Ross-teen (Nigga)
He Back (I see ya, nigga)
I'm back (I smell that money)
I'm back (Yeah)
I'm back (Talk to me, nigga)
It's nowhere to go

[Hook: Mannie Fresh]
I'm talkin' Japanese Denim, money stuffed in 'em
Got the coolest of the cars and the baddest of the women
All I have in this world, all I have in this world
All I have in this world, all I have in this world
Hey, I'mma work it on the corner, work it on the block
Work it 'til they love me, baby work it 'til it's hot
All I have in this world, all I have in this world
All I have in this world, all I have in this world

[Verse 1: Rick Ross]
I lift the system in the house and I let's my bitch drive
Twenty disc changer, I goes to disc 5
No it's not the silent treatment, I let's the bitch vibe
Fire up the kush, she hit it, "Now this fire!"
Now imagine how she look with cat eyes and thick thighs
Put her on the payroll 'cause flat out she get's down
See that ass from the side, that's before she sits down
And her mouth get wet as a bottle of Cristal
Niggas lookin' at me, pa but I'm packin' a pistol
Fuck kicked out, bitch I'm tearin' this shit down
Yeah my Chevy sittin' high so it's hard to get down
Watch that dick standin' up, girl it's hard to get down
Got them chickens in the trap so I hardly sit down
Some problem Alphabet Boys get them charges to stick now
Bitch, you ain't gotta guess it's me and Mannie Fresh
You know we gettin' money by the way a nigga dress

[Hook: Mannie Fresh]
I'm talkin' Japanese Denim, money stuffed in 'em
Got the coolest of the cars and the baddest of the women
All I have in this world, all I have in this world
All I have in this world, all I have in this world
Hey, I'mma work it on the corner, work it on the block
Work it 'til they love me, baby work it 'til it's hot
All I have in this world, all I have in this world
All I have in this world, all I have in this world

[Verse 2: Rick Ross]
Smokin 'on sativa, name of the reefer
The cloud so thick pussy, nigga I don't see ya
Your hoe so thick pussy, nigga she don't see ya
Your hoe so thick pussy, nigga she don't need ya
My hoes so thick pussy, nigga they ain't nothin'
I don't love that hoe pussy, nigga there ain't nothin'
My money so long, his money ain't nothin'
My money in front of me, his money just frontin'
You know the routine, still movin' a few things
Rollin' on two beams in them new blue jeans
Japanese denim money stuffed in 'em
Twenty something cars, motherfucker I'm winnin'

[Hook: Mannie Fresh]
I'm talkin' Japanese Denim, money stuffed in 'em
Got the coolest of the cars and the baddest of the women
All I have in this world, all I have in this world
All I have in this world, all I have in this world
Hey, I'mma work it on the corner, work it on the block
Work it 'til they love me, baby work it 'til it's hot
All I have in this world, all I have in this world
All I have in this world, all I have in this world

[Verse 3: Rick Ross]
Sippin' on that Remy outside of the club
Got me trippin' like I'm Remy outside of the club
Yeah them bitches comin' with me, I'm shinin' like a bug
I don't even think it's trickin', just temporary love
Chickens pullin' on my shirt, I'm just worried about the chains
Tattoos cover 80 percent of the Don's frame
Cancel it and unless I debut LeBron James
Came back Mike Vick, I buried ya dog brains
Y'all ducks want the birds, if not just keep walkin'
Got the top down and I'm feelin' like Steve Austin
You know the routine, still movin' a few things
Rollin' on two beans in them new blue jeans

[Hook: Mannie Fresh]
I'm talkin' Japanese Denim, money stuffed in 'em
Got the coolest of the cars and the baddest of the women
All I have in this world, all I have in this world
All I have in this world, all I have in this world
Hey, I'mma work it on the corner, work it on the block
Work it 'til they love me, baby work it 'til it's hot
All I have in this world, all I have in this world
All I have in this world, all I have in this world

[Outro: Rick Ross]
