[Verse 1: Scarface]
I'm on the highway, buzzed from the contact
Her body nice, but her face look like a wombat
Guess where her tongue's at? All in my earhole
Breath smelling like warm beer, what a weirdo
Now look at here, ho, that shit is aggravating
I don't kiss 'em on the first date, but her imagination's
Running wild; this must have been her first time ghosting
And now she's got her nipples out, top's down, posting
Blunt still smoking, burning up my white seats
Pulling on my cargo's, trying to get to my Lee
I like the white freaks, they lawless when they go down
Hanging out my sunroof, panting to her toes now
I got to get up on the latest ho-down
Called up the other bitch I'm fucking, let her show out
I rarely go out, but when I do I'm whipping something rimmed-up
Two hundred forty thou, gripping real
Wood grain steering wheels
Y'all niggas tripping, I am FaceMob mobbing
All in the pimping
My nigga listen, I am still bout that dumb shit
South Side of H-Town, fuck where I'm from, bitch
I'll give you one wish, but after that it's lights out
And I am not James Toney, get the ice out
Cause I will dot them eyes like a student do
Style so versatile I'm confusing you
That's what the dude'll do, word to the motherfucker
Started off one way, switch it to the other
Cause a cold nigga do what the others can't do
Monotone-type rappers, what the fuck they gonna do?
Coming through

[Verse 2: Slim Thug]
Something new -- white, black, or that blue
Bad bitch sitting in it; she ain't mine, she fuck crew
We do this shit for practice, million in my mattress
Pull up in the projects sounding off with an actress
Believe me, I done it; damn right I stunted
Had her up in Dreams late night, getting blunted
Still keep it one hundred, and not a nickel short
Ask anybody over on that Northfield vault
Used to call me Young Boss, now they call me O.G
And half the niggas call me that older than me
Been getting mine for a long time, hustling since a teen
But now I get to relax, kick back like a king
Still fiend for the paper, so the hustle don't stop
Can't never go broke, I'm too used to rolling drop
Too used to balling knots, spending racks at the mall
You know it costs to shop, fifty six, six tall
Too big to do it small
Sorry for all the capping
But I'm still real surprised on how much I made rapping
Thought I'd be outside trapping like everybody else
Never thought I'd be standing here by myself
My best friend locked, the other got shot
Couldn't even fuck with him, mayne, he robbed the whole block
And I'm the one not, who ain't that hard to spot
Fucking with them, I would've been got popped
Gotta watch out for haters that grow with success
Don't be weak for bitches, they only bring stress
Keep the Lord on my chest, and gold on my chain
I'mma stay real forever, I never ever change, mayne

[Verse 3: M.U.G.]
All I do is chase, all I want is cake
I just want to touch a mil before my death day
So I rarely sleep, but I'm always awake
Because I'm thinking of more ways I can load up the safe
I know I ain't living safe
I gotta keep my heater loaded to the max
So prepare when them jackers try to come attack
Hollow-tip and infrared beam comes attached
Mashing through my neighborhood dressed in all-black
Matter of fact, it's orange and some navy blue
I cannot describe these streets, it's a crazy zoo
Niggas dying; keep your strap cause it may be you
Mama burned a G, June 3rd, '82
I make my moves so police don't got a clue
I needs mine C.O.D. cause my rent due
Hard times ain't shit, we gon get through
Long as them dollar bills we get big to

[Hook: M.U.G.]
All I do is chase
If you ain't talking paper, move around from my space
Cause I'm trying to get my bank like Chase
All I wanna see is Ben Franklins in my face
So all I do is chase
We get money, fuck bitches
All I do is chase
