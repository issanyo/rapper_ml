[Verse 1: Scarface]
I spent my years isolated
Couldn't live with myself
I was troubled as a young kid
My tears didn't help
Manic depressed and was evident
I buried it deep
All alone with these four walls caving at me
Barricaded was my mind state
I wanted to die
Never happiness
Just sad time living a lie
Rather leave me
I was suicidal
Slittin' my wrist
Mama thinking I was crazy
Like use some sense
And on them days I was feeling
I was paining inside
It wasn't me
It was my inner feelings coming alive
I remember waking up like I was headed for school
Left me standing in the hospital
Locked in this room
Put away
I'm a troubled kid losing my mind
Fallin' short
Of what they expected from me every time
So don't fault me if you meet me
And I look to be strange
I'm just mad that the sunshine dies in the rain

[Hook: Anthony Hamilton]
Sunshine to the rain
When it comes it goes again
Even when the story ends
Just turn the page and begin again
Sunshine on cloudy days
Don't hate me I'll never change
Thankful I was made this way
Your sunshine for cloudy days

[Verse 2: Scarface]
Now I was raised in a neighborhood
With half of a dime
If you was real it was understood
It showed in your eyes
Every corner had a different hustle
Sprawled on your face
Drug wars
Growin' up raw cause violence the case
...had to move along
Quiet as kept
Spoken words got you dealt with
So ride with yourself
I'm a juvenile
They telling me get down for your wealth
No getting high
Cause when you get high
You have to get help
As far as health
Mine was mental though
You know how that go
Psychologically
I deal with demons talkin' in codes
Hopefully, I'll get to meet Jesus
Somewhere on this road
Sick of hearing people screaming in my head saying no
Better of if I was dead
Cause they killing me slow
All in all it's just a part of life
Watching the show
Ain't nothing never came to niggas sleep
Except for a dream
It's like a movie with the ending credits etched in the scene

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Scarface]
I prayed my last days of sunshine
Just die in the rain
Kinda selfish
But I know that dying
Eases the pain
Heartfelt words
Spoken hurt
Provided the frame
For the picture I done painted for the master to explain
So I leave behind my testimony
Witness the gift
Far from holy
But this matrimony provided the script
To live on
And live by
Grow up and grow on
Get on and get by
So forth and so on
And this here's the last days
I can hear the horns singin'
I can see the red sky
I can hear the drum beating
I seen the dead die
How long will they mourn Jesus
At least I'm saved by my scriptural warn readings
And while leaving you here
Believe what you believe in
But you don't want to not believe
Believe in seeing
Don't take this here too personal
Cause I'm just speaking
This is my family on my mind

[Hook]
