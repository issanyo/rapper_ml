[Hook: Bilal]
I'm having nightmares...oooooohhh
My niggas say I'm p-noid, they say I'm just p-noid
I'm having nightmares...oooooohhh
My niggas say I'm p-noid, they say I'm just p-noid

[Verse 1: Bilal]
I'm waking up in the middle of the night
My heartbeat's pumpin' like something ain't right
Oh what's goin' on?
When I go outside I feel something behind me
I'm looking back, but nothin's around me
(Oh what's goin' on...) Man, I don't know, what am I trippin' on?
There's something in the room, it's lurkin' in the shadows
Staring through the darkness...man I don't know
These four walls are closing in, these voices ain't my friend
They hauntin' me...those, those memories

[Hook: Bilal]
I'm having nightmares...oooooohhh
My niggas say I'm p-noid, they say I'm just p-noid
I'm having nightmares...oooooohhh
My niggas say I'm p-noid, they say I'm just p-noid

[Verse 2: Malice]
They comin' for me, they runnin' up
I'm on my balcony, seeing through the eyes of Tony
They say we homies, but I see hatred
Do not they know brotherly love is sacred?
Niggas catch feelin's, even contemplate killin's
When you see millions, there are many chameleons
You're not a gunna for real, you're just a runna
Haters, I spot you from afar and I'm the Deer Hunter
They be thinkin' nice car, nice crib
I be thinkin' how long will these niggas let me live
I understand, cause people need things
And they will take it from you, and take you from your seedlings
So even when the mumblers talk
I still walk the most humblest walk
And one day, they may even catch up with me man
But 'til then, I'm Leonardo, Catch Me If You Can, ah!

[Hook: Bilal]
I'm having nightmares...oooooohhh
My niggas say I'm p-noid, they say I'm just p-noid
I'm having nightmares...oooooohhh
My niggas say I'm p-noid, they say I'm just p-noid

[Verse 3: Pharrell]
Look over your shoulder, something is near
And I'm so scared, when I'm alone I'm so scared
Now it's inching closer, trouble is near
But nothing's there, when I look nothing's there
I'm outta my mind, I'm runnin' from guilt, but
It's right by my side, there's nowhere to hide
I'm outta my mind, I'm runnin' from guilt, but
It's right by my side, there's nowhere to hide

[Verse 4: Pusha T]
I make big money, drive big cars
Everybody know me, it's like I'm a movie star
Virginia nights, sellin hard white
To sellin' out shows, every gangsta love my flow
Still, I creep low, thinking niggas trying to harm me
Hoping my karma ain't coming back here to haunt me
Was it that nigga, I took his powder with a smile
Pray to the Lord, the gun ain't pop and hit the child, shit
I pilt niggas' girls back like alpha-hydroxy
Spent money like Happy Days, I'm the real Fonzie
Top off the coupe, that's how JFK got shot, B
Can't let niggas roll up beside me, and 2Pac me
Holla if you hear me, tears flowing sincerely
Check up on my block weekly, my health yearly
Something's wrong with me, niggas don't get along with me
Got a fo-fo, hope your body got strong kidneys, oh!

[Hook: Bilal]
I'm having nightmares...oooooohhh
My niggas say I'm p-noid, they say I'm just p-noid
I'm having nightmares...oooooohhh
My niggas say I'm p-noid, they say I'm just p-noid
