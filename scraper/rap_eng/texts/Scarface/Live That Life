(“I always found a way to get it…”)

[Chorus]
If you a real nigga, live that life, like
You the reason why these streets get to see that white
You the reason why these niggas get to see that price
Move ki’s like they O-Z’s and re-up (Right)

[Verse 1]
The stand-up type, never to fold under pressure
You don’t talk much, it ain’t a whole lot can stress ya
You want it all, won’t settle for nothing lesser
They come in wrong, they leaving out on a stretcher
Born killin’, you ain’t trippin’ on dying
Took out a bunch of muthafuckas out here slippin’ that tried
If it was money to be made, it’s got
They saying all money ain’t good—nah, it’s not
So, with that in mind, you envisioned a change
To get your ass up off of these streets and out the game
Witnessing niggas getting popped get out
Knowing goddamn well them punks supposed to rot

[Chorus]
If you a real nigga, live that life, like
You the reason why these streets get to see that white
You the reason why these niggas get to see that price
Move ki’s like they O-Z’s a G (That’s right)

[Verse 2]
Hard times hit and shit gets slow
You’re like a dope fiend geeking, trying to get that dough
You face a lifetime if you get court
Niggas in this position shouldn’t fuck with dope (Nope)
Say it again like I said before
All money ain’t good and he the feds for sure
If he can get it when it ain’t none
We in the middle of a drought, charging 700 for an ounce
Back and forth out of town, trying to make it jump
Take a nigga block and pump
Come back on the block and dump
Headlines read: “Body found dead, shot, locked in trunk”
A message to them cocaine cowboys
Get it while it’s good, but when it’s got, get up out, boy
Regardless if the block is hot
Them streets talk; when them niggas start to talk, they plot

[Chorus]
If you a real nigga, live that life, like
You the reason why these streets get to see that white
You the reason why these niggas get to see that price
Move ki’s like they O-Z’s a G (That’s right)

[Verse 3]
Money and greed breed hate and jealousy
One nigga rich, the next nigga want it times three
And when he get it, he gon’ go to extremes
To make for sure that ain’t nobody living larger than he
And for a minute, they was targeting me
But realized that I was legal, I’m just part of these streets
A real nigga ‘til they close the top
All I know is counting money, fucking hoes in drop
Two-seaters, not a tabloid reader
But I know this dope game is like the rap game
See us on a mash out mission, stop bullshittin’
Tired of strugglin’, niggas got they masks on missionin’
Them boys looking at the Border Patrol
‘Cause they the reason ain’t nobody out here got no dope
For sure, homie, when you touch and move on
Got the hood down wit’cha so you can’t go wrong

[Chorus]
If you a real nigga, live that life, like
You the reason why these streets get to see that white
You the reason why these niggas get to see that price
Move ki’s like they O-Z’s a G (That’s right)
If you a real nigga, live that life, like
You the reason why these streets get to see that white
You the reason why these niggas get to see that price
Move ki’s like they O-Z’s a G (That’s right)
