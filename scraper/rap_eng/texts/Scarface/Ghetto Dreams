[Intro: 2 Chainz & John Legend]
Yeah, preach, preach
My ghetto dreams always turn to ghetto nightmares

[Verse 1: 2 Chainz]
At night I can't sleep, I toss and turn
Candlesticks in the dark, I was whippin' the hard
I was gettin' the broads, they like "Who the hell is that?"
I was dealin' sacks, you lookin' at a nigga that drove to Hell and back
Charismatic, I was raised by an addict
With money in the attic, got guns while you at it
At this present time, I'm out of my mind and that's a habit
Still got 'em waitin' in line, they gotta have it, yeah

[Chorus: John Legend]
Last night was the first night I got sleep (Oh)
Tossin' and turnin' for two or three weeks (Oh)
My nightmares are triggered by bad memories (Oh)
Lord, send me an angel right now while I'm havin' ghetto dreams

[Verse 2: 2 Chainz]
Cold sweats listenin' to the old Sweat
One, two, that's a whole check (One, two)
Nah, for real, nigga this a whole check (Check)
Just horsin' around, Polo sweats (Yeah)
Used to dream 'bout a bigger couch (Uh)
Woke up in a bigger house, c'mon
Commas in my bank account
So much money I had to let the banker count

[Chorus: John Legend]
Last night was the first night I got sleep (Oh)
Tossin' and turnin' for two or three weeks (Oh)
My nightmares are triggered by bad memories (Oh)
Lord, send me an angel right now while I'm havin' ghetto dreams

[Verse 3: Scarface]
It's like the world stand still
Yesterday your little man got killed
And all he ever wanted was a bank roll
But he died too young 'cause the game's cold
Most niggas ain't know or they just think slow
Once you get in, you gots to leave, but you can't though
'Cause freedom make a motherfucker evil
To the point, down your ass when he see you
Let's take that needle, fill it with poison
Inject the ghetto with the drug, paranoia
Got you lookin' at your homeboy sideways
Ain't no honor among thieves, is it nowadays?
They tell me crime pays, but I don't think so
'Cause every criminal I know is in the clink, yo
A nigga in the game right now
Must be workin' for them people 'cause that shit played out

[Outro: John Legend]
I lay awake in my four corner room, tinted candles
Yeah

My ghetto dreams always turn to ghetto nightmares
