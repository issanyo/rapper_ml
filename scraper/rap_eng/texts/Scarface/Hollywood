[Verse 1: Game]
Open up the mind of a killer
Niggas on the front line strong as gorillas
Another dead body in the mist
Compton tattooed on his stomach, ain't that a bitch
Hub City, thugs with me buck 50
Reunite with G-Unit? Bitch, fuck 50
Look, take this dick or take this hit
We do it big, keep our bitches on that fey-fey shit
So what it is, let me tell you what it ain't
Niggas tryna leave the city but they can't
Stuck on Central and Rosecrans
America meet the dope man
More gold than Trinidad James
Guns in both hands
Fiends smokin' rock out of Coke cans
Seduced by that white girl, Marilyn Monroe man
You see the city, right?
You got some weed and the molly, good
Now take your bitch ass to Hollywood

[Verse 2: Scarface]
Light, camera, action, you’re gone
Hollywood swing, but when I catch you it’s on
The streets got 3 simple rules we abide by
Hear no evil, speak none, you through blind eyes
Niggas need to learn to keep they mouth shut
Nosey motherfuckers get their ass shot the fuck up
It’s money over everything, trust me
So I’mma let my nuts hang, and plus we’ve
Been known to pull them murderous stunts
And get away scot-free, niggas puffin’ they blunts
And gettin’ down in they movie room
My niggas Loonie Tunes
Cause when it’s fuck me, then it’s fuck you
I’m all day plottin’ on that get-back
And when it’s all mapped out, you finna get that
I show a motherfucker where the strength at
I said I had an army and I meant that
So if Holly wanna hide in California then Holly could
But I’ve got killers off in Holly-hood
So take your bitch-ass out to Hollywood
Take your bitch-ass out to Hollywood
