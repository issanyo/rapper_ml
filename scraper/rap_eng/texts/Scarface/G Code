[Ad-Lib]
Man
Motherfuckers just follow a nigga around, dude
That's real
Some shit though, fuck these feds
Redneck, racist motherfuckers, man!

[Verse 1]
I don't wanna run (run) no more, but I know that if I stop
I'll be another nigga headed to heaven, hanging with 'Pac
These motherfuckers look at me like I'm a slanger
Makin threats to my family, dawg I'm in danger
Who do you call when these agents want you dead
And they hit these penitentiaries and niggas make a pledge
So I dip and duck the feds, all my homies stuck out on indictments
Caught up on the phone, talking prices (Hello?)
25-to-life's the mandatory minimal
My whole community gets treated like they criminals
Prior convictions getting motherfuckers hung
Got a C.I. on the inside and everybody's sung
Mothers and fathers separated from they sons
Households are broken, you couldn't hold your tongue
If it's yours, say it's yours, take the case, do your time
When you was out here getting money from it everything was fine
Now you crying in your jail cell, stressing on the case
And the D.A. is at a nigga every other day
I can see it in your face, in the middle of your soul
You in question of your manhood homey (Keep the code)

[Chorus]
We don't talk to police, we don't make a peace bond
We don't talk to police
We don't trust in the judicial system, we shoot guns
We rely on the streets we do battle in the hood
We rely on these streets dawg
I was born in the G Code, embedded in my blood
We don't talk to police, we don't make a peace bond
Said we don't talk to police
We ain't trustin' in the judicial system, we shoot guns
We rely on the streets we do battle in the hood
Yeah we rely on these streets dawg
I was born in the G Code, embedded in my blood

[Verse 2]
See I be on some street shit, don't talk to police
I won't accept a visit from agents who wanna see
If I got shit to say about a nigga case
I'm a motherfucking nigga through and through, I ain't gay
Know a nigga caught a case and he took his 25
Sat it out on appeal, and gave him back that time
A soldier in his mind and his actions said the same
Told a cracker tell your mammy suck his dick cuz he with James
Ain't no motherfucking game, we been living this for real
When the government is working, real niggas never squeal
Right here the truth revealed, Troy you a mouse
Yeah you rapping but the homey Lil Pots can't get out
Niggas they hit the pen, they get charged, then get out
On a Rule 35, he informing for the cops
You can hear it in his voice, I done listened to the tapes
Now you showing up in court, testifying for the state

[Chorus]
We don't talk to police, we don't make a peace bond
We don't talk to police
We don't trust in the judicial system, we shoot guns
We rely on the streets, we do battle in the hood
We rely on these streets dawg
I was born in the G Code, embedded in my blood
We don't talk to police, we don't make a peace bond
Said we don't talk to police
We ain't trustin' in the judicial system, we shoot guns
We rely on the streets we do battle in the hood
Yeah we rely on these streets dawg
I was born in the G Code, embedded in my blood

[Verse 3]
I'm knowing all the scams, all the tricks to the trade
Know a nigga trying to get clean, and you get in the way
Know a nigga tryin to get green, and you stick out the bait
Cause a nigga like a dopefiend, can't rehabilitate
Still stickin to the G Code, we playing by the rules
We don't fuck around with new niggas, cause new niggas is fools
We don't photograph the homies, that'll catch a nigga up
On a picture you a victim, bottom line nigga fucked
Only connect the real, staying down with the true
I got love for you Ant, you a real nigga Spook
My nigga Spoonie Gee, I can only name a few
But there's a thousand motherfuckers in the pen bulletproof
So this one here's for you, I'm a rep it 'til I die
Fuck a 5-K-1, check his P-S-I
Send his ass to the top if he say he sit at home
He a motherfucking snitch, snitching niggas need this song

[Chorus]
We don't talk to police, we don't make a peace bond
We don't talk to police
We don't trust in the judicial system, we shoot guns
We rely on the streets we do battle in the hood
We rely on these streets dawg
I was born in the G Code, embedded in my blood
We don't talk to police, we don't make a peace bond
Said we don't talk to police
We ain't trustin' in the judicial system, we shoot guns
We rely on the streets we do battle in the hood
Yeah we rely on these streets dawg
I was born in the G Code, embedded in my blood

[Outro]
We don't talk to police
We rely on these streets dawg
Said we don't talk to police
Yeah we rely on these streets dawg
