Im praying
Im praying
That you wouldn't go away
Complaining
Always hating
'Bout every step that I take
Im taking
Im taking
Too many drugs nowadays
Im saying
That I've made
A very big mistake
I wanna die
This night
I'll lie high in the...
Ride or die
I've retried
Many times
I hope I've satisfied
Every bit of your life
I will fucking cry
Everyday of this lie
