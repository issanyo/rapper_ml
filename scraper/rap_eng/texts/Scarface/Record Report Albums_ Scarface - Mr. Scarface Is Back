Geto Boys fans will flip over Scarface's solo effort. Simply stated, Mr. Scarface Is Back personifies the term "hardcore gangsta shit" and hits harder than an aluminium bat. Scarface, a "homicidal maniac with suicidal tendencies" takes the listener on a hell-raising journey to experience the lifestyles of the violent and dangerous. An incredible rhymer with a menacing flow, Scarface weaves graphically detailed rhymes with a forceful delivery that brings his tales of mayhem and murder to life. On many songs, you expect to hear a chorus, but Scarface is like an Energizer--he keeps going...and going...and going.

     Titles like "Born Killer," "Murder By Reason Of Insanity," "Diary of a Madman," and "A Minute To Pray A Second To Die" illustrate the demented mindstate that Scarface uses to write his songs. The album starts off with the slamming "Mr. Scarface," a continuation of "Scarface" from The Geto Boys second album, and just doesn't let up. Some of the fattest tracks include "Murder...," "Your Ass Got Took," and "I'm Dead."

     The posse of producers cook up some hardcore grooves that will make speakers bleed. The 5th Ward crew has a knack for making simple, funky tracks full of horns, organs and guitar licks laid over fat bass-laden gangsta beat that you just cannot front on. Combine that with Scarface's riveting rhyme techniques and you really can't go wrong on this record. Scarface, like his Houston co-horts, has come off, making an album that takes it to yet another level.
