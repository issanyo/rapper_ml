I just be messin’ with these honkeys, as usual. Because they ain’t worried about me, they got me. But they worried about the kids. Because the youth is more feisty now than it was. And the cold game is what they’re doing now, they done put the prisons on the open market, you know, it’s on the stock exchange. Big companies own prisons now. They all got stock in prisons—MasterCard, Smith Barney. These honkeys so cold out this way, they don’t wanna see me do nothing. They won’t even let my family make no money. Even with the Ghetto Prisoner clothing. They won’t even let my son, my wife, nobody do anything—they messing with the clothing company. They’ve been going to the manufacturers. Their orders ain’t getting there on time no more since the government got involved with this case. They’ve been going to the stores, retailers, and telling them that they can’t sell ‘em. They’ve been stopping the kids here in Chicago…

You know, it’s political. But see, the mayor is scared of me
— Yeah
The mayor is scared of me because—they gon’ lay you down and put a dick in your ass. If you move your ass, they consider you rebellious, you know? I’m moving my butt so they consider me a rebellious nigga. See, I’m telling these young boys to put them guns down and pick up that ballot, you know?
— Right
You know, you can kill as many niggas as you want as long as you don’t go to the polls
— Right
But if you go to the polls, they gon’ snatch you off the streets, you know? If we don’t do nothin’ about this stuff in a minute, shit, we at the point of no return
