Hey yo, check dis dope ass beat out
Willie back in da muthafuckin house and i got my niggas
Da menace clan on dis one to help me out
And we representin our god damn selves
Cuz how da fuck
You gona tell me how to get to where I'm goin
When you dont know where da fuck you goin
Man das da blind leadin da muthafuckin blind

I should've been a leader not a follower a coach not a balla
I could've had progress
I could've lived wit less stress
But i took it upon myself and played da card i wuz delt
Thought about my self
Fuck everyone else
And they said fuck me too
But it was cool like that
You see my mission was paper chasin and puttin da hood on da map
Now i've done been there
Done that
Took one step and two back
For da life of me I'm thinking
Wut da fuck wuz i thinkin
Should'v slowed the shit sinkin
But I'm stuck with a code
Niggas wait around to see if i wuz gonna come up befo
But i can't fold like a bitch
And it's too late to switch
But i wuz brought up yo make it
Seen da chance to take it
Find a rule and break it
Locate the badge and shake it
And against all odds
Get da fuck outta dodge
Pop our nigga wit records dat da state can't file
Young, blind, and wild
An uncontrollable child in da ghetto
And I'm settlin fo mo everyday
And when i make up my mind I'm gonna get back in line but now I'm
Chorus 2x

Blind leadin da blind
In a world of wars i search for peace of mind my stabillity
Fo my niggas and me said da way life wuz supposed to be in da ghetto

I looked out my window wut did i see
It wuz a crack head nigga starin dead at me
He said can i get a muthafuckin nickle for three
I told his ass to da better in his rorock swetta
He got a daughter he ain't fed her
He'd rather get high
In his eye i see da demon
I can hear babies screamin
Feenin
It demeaning to see him
To be in the ghetto
But this is where i settle
Now wut would you do wit a strap in yo hand
Gangstas do wut dey wunt to
Suckas do wut dey can
My role modle sips on a forty botlle
In his footsteps i follow grab da brew and take a swallow
I've been livin on da streets since da age of thirteen
Cuz i wuz sick of being raised by a dope fiend i so seen
Babies need similac money dat wuz meant for similac wuz spent on crack
Now do you wanna..kno why its a liquor store on every cona
And niggas ain't da owna- listen, we can't afford to send our kids to school but dey got da knowledge-
Spend our money with the Japs and they send they kids to college-
Now here we are: hoes, dopes, dealers, and bums
At da white man's table still beggin fo crumbs
Chorus 2x

Niggas shoot ball
(niggas shoot da logs)
Nigas shoot da doves
(niggas shoot to love)
Niggas shoot up
(niggas shoot pool)
But watch out cuz niggas shoot niggas too
So wut da fuck am i to do when niggas fallin down like flies
And dis muthafuckin money starin me in da eyes
And my brother sayin come on in stop buggin
But we done already lost 3 uncles and 5 cousins
To da streets niggas shit deep
No room fo da maple leafs
Cuz muthafuckas play fo keep
I wunt respect when i step on da field
Saw a nigga dat killed i gotta kill befo deez niggas get sum bright ideals
And start thinkin we hoes or sumthin
So when i see dat muthafucka nigga nigga staight dumpin
Chorus 2x
