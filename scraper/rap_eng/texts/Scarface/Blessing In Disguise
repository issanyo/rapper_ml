[Verse 1: Scarface]
Â­I live just enough for the city so I get by
Money never changed how I felt, would I risk my
Life for a dollar, homie? Nah, I don't think so
Greed breeds jealous, niggas out here wantin' info's
Catch a nigga slippin', put a bullet in his temple
Homie, it's the same rules, money talks, simple
My kinfolk, call it what I'm livin' like the high life
Only if he knew what I had to do to keep my mind right
I, I tell you I got 20/20 hindsight
See it in the distance, hieroglyphics keep the rhymes tight
My mind like, game recognize that
Real recognize real, still .45 strapped
Underneath the white tee, Zimmerman get shot down
Hero, it ain't nothin' but a sandwich, call the cops now
Fuck the police, stop runnin'
White boys terrorize nigga' neighborhoods, gunnin'
Down the innocent, in the beginnin' it's:
"You was doin' 50 in the 35", the endin' is:
"You fit the description of the subject in this incident
We gon' have to take you downtown for some questionin'"
Damn, a blessin' in disguise if you ask me
I was just about to hit the highway with my last ki
Could it be that maybe God has intervened?
Spared my life like he did so many times in between?
A half a block away from the crime scene
A minute earlier and that was me, think
I've been knowin' Ross since he was Teflon
Same nigga now as back then, nothin' stepped on
Dopeman, dopeman yellin'
Cook it 'til it's rock hard, bag it up, sell it
Aroma so loud, so loud that you can smell it
Death to them niggas gettin' caught go and tellin'

[Hook: Z-Ro]
And every time I turn around, y'all got somethin' to say about me
But y'all don't know a damn thing about me
Just what you see, that's what you judge me on
Every time I turn around, the guilty be pointin' fingers at me
Homie, I'm just tryna be all I can be
But not for free, that's what the fuck be wrong
I need that

[Interlude: Rick Ross]
Damn, can't even believe this day here, my nigga
I remember us sittin' in the parkin' lot talkin' about gettin' money

[Verse 2: Rick Ross]
Cracks in the wall, standin' in the puddle
Sunny south Florida, a cold motherfucker
Ready for a war, barely wanna talk
Ballys on my nigga as they walkin' back and forth
Makes you wanna hustle, take care of my brothers
Raymond passed away, here's somethin' for his mother
It never is enough, tryna show her that I love him
We were fishin' buddies, breed the dog, split the puppies
Pictures on the wall, bitches we done raw
Niggas gettin' robbed, the only shit that we can solve
We all wanna get it, ball for a minute
Accept collect calls, tell our dawgs that we did it
Plenty money orders, that what uncle Kenny taught us
Keep your face clean when you're out here bendin' corners
Always keep in mind you'll fall in love a thousand times
Regardless what we went through, I'm still right here by your side
Artificial homies, worse than the agents
When you parkin' all your cars, they wanna know the payments
Rose petals drippin' on the casket
Baby boy done grew into a bastard
On that lean, you know I fuck her fantastic
Work white as Rita Ora in that plastic
Took shots, shed tears, that's war
Bust bottles on yachts, stand tall
Catch a case, don't talk, that's raw
Scarface, Rick Ross, big boys
Big boys
Scarface, Rozay, we big boys

[Hook: Z-Ro]
And every time I turn around, y'all got somethin' to say about me
But y'all don't know a damn thing about me
Just what you see, that's what you judge me on
Every time I turn around, the guilty be pointin' fingers at me
Homie, I'm just tryna be all I can be
But not for free, that's what the fuck be wrong
I need that

[Outro: Z-Ro]
(That bag, that bag)
I need that (that bag, that bag)
I need that (that bag, that bag)
I need that bag (hey, hey, hey)
