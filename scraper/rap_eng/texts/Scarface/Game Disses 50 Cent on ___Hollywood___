They say old habits die hard, and that’s evidently true when it comes to Game. Despite openly expressing his desire to get the old G-Unit crew back together on numerous occasions this year, the Compton rapper has renewed his verbal assault against 50 Cent.

“Hub city, thugs with me, buck 50 / Reunite with G-Unit? Bitch, f— 50,” he raps on ‘Hollywood,’ a bonus track on the iTunes version of his brand new ‘OKE (Operation Kill Everything)‘ mixtape that features legendary Texas rapper Scarface.

As Complex points out, Game’s diss against his former boss comes just days after he told DJ Skee, “If it makes sense dollar-wise, as far as securing the future of my family financially, then I’d get back with 50.” At the start of the year, he even launched the petition site GUnitReunion.com.

It’s time you make up your mind, Jayceon. Word to Souls of Mischief.
