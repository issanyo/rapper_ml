[Chorus 2X]
Lift your head to the sky and keep trying
Believe in you, and it will take you higher

[Verse 1]
You've been
Missing
Out on all the chances you've been given
Is it something (Something)
Within
Holding you back instead of living?

[Pre-Chorus]
Your day is coming though it seems far
Things will be clear when you love who you are
Nothing can stop you as long as you listen to your heart

[Chorus]
Lift your head to the sky and keep trying
Believe in you, and it will take you higher
Lift your head to the sky and keep trying
(If you want to, you can fly)
Believe in you, and it will take you higher

[Verse 2]
You have
Sorrows
Everywhere you turn they seem to follow
If you
Let go
Happiness will come to you tomorrow

[Pre-Chorus]
Your day is coming though it seems far
Things will be clear when you love who you are
Nothing can stop you as long as you listen to your heart

[Chorus]
Lift your head to the sky and keep trying
Believe in you, and it will take you higher
(You believe and you can go far)
Lift your head to the sky and keep trying
Believe in you, and it will take you higher

[Rap: Royal C]
I’m the bigger macadosius, king of ferocious rhymes, incredible
Royal is edible to make the theory unforgettable
Believe in yourself, and keep your head straight
Strengthen your mind and then avoid all the dead weight
And hey, your day is coming, so don’t rush it
Just like a stove, if it’s too hot, then don’t touch it
Because it get as hard as you let it be
And remember you heard that from Groove Theory and Royal C
You can make it, keep trying

[Chorus (Repeat until fade)]
Lift your head to the sky and keep trying
Believe in you, and it will take you higher
