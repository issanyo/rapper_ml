[Taboo]
Circumstances were like my first fight, word life, I was not the herb type
I was the type of kid that would swing his fists to earn stripes
Knocked out an older kid for trying to snatch my dirt bike
25 years later I'm still scrapping for my birthright
Try to preserve light in a dark place where I dwell
Became a fighter when I found the strength inside of myself
Dying in a dry spell but I survived hell
And become the glory of the stories that time tells
Prod cells open, freedom mentally imprisoned
Deaf hear the ??, eventually they listen
It's the tale on Earth essentially, a heavenly rendition
Walking dead pedigree with a propensity for living
Just trying to keep the hope alive
Before I focus these open eyes just in time to watch the culture die
I vocalize a soulful vibe
And broke the ties that bonds us to these social lies that we socialize
So as my name goes around the room revealing who's the deal
You can resume consuming your super pills to cure your newest ill
We might not pay for what we choose to deal, the future will
Cuz we aim for the heart and forget the part that we shoot to kill
Got me down on my knees screaming "Why? Please!"
That's why I fry trees until my eyes bleed
The way that I see, we're building great walls between ourselves so I might as well be talking Chinese
Us humans are clever, invent all these units of measure
To comparing your trash to prove that we're better
All these illusions are convoluting the center
So I target with sharp wit until the illusion is severed
We can change radically, we'd rather be at the mall shopping
Reminds me of New Years the way that we ball dropping
At this point I got to force it, exhausted all options
Screaming death for all, ready to get this brawl popping
Stand ?? associated with spitting realness
But I don't care, I'm never scared, this kid is fearless
The message is in the lyrics but there's interference
It seems your ego's turned up so loud that you didn't hear it
You've become a disgusted version of a serpent
Trust you would see it like us if you would just observe it
What's for certain is most people formulate their opinions when they should be listening to the other person
Bunch of stupid fuckers walking through the gutter
Confusing the fact of talking at for they're talking to each other
Compassion flows through me so I have a duty brother
To make sure that you discover there's someone who truly loves ya
I'm trying to educate the simpletons
Get in tune with the heartstrings like resonating instruments
I'll forever say the mission is to separate from ignorance
So we can find a way to celebrate our differences
So I breathe hard a deep prayer like please God
Lend me your armor and shield so I can deal with these retards
And deep scars, we need some CPR
It's hilarious language ain't the barrier, we are
Massive confusion in the land of illusion
Where cancerous answer fuel grandeur's delusion
Trying to raise man to a different standard of human
So I treat every interaction like a family reunion
But we watch humanity die while we stood still
That just proves the fact that looks could kill
I should chill but still I'm running up these foothills
On some Matt Damon shit cuz I'm hunting for some good will
I've never seen something so evil
As when yo' people put one in your dome with that chrome Eagle
Tryna catch it with a ratchet like you stole from Home Depot
So they can repo your soul, give it to ??
End of your story, no sequel
It ain't the enemy who gets you, it's always your own ego
It's always your own ego...

[Tones]

Mass confusion is killing me
I'd give away my life and my liberty, cuz I'd die for my brothers willingly
And know the will to live is still in me
It's taken for granted cuz I was born in a position you would kill to be
Still I don't acknowledge, you're quick to symbolics
How they waste they're teen years and make kids go to college
Don't know shit if you pass, history class they're twisting knowledge
Won't stop til this whole system's abolished
The people build they own monuments, spreading out wings
And we put an end to cherishing material things
These rappers more like bitches, gossip queens, I've really seen it
The bond of me and Taboo you can't get between it
It's bigger than a rap crew, we got the same bloodline
Before sunrise after midnight keep the sun shining
Until it unties and the circle complete
Crazy how these people raise me with words and a beat
?? ??, learned the streets at a young age
Started writing out how I could change your life on one page
First time it happened I could never forget it
It was on the internet, this kid sent me a message
Yo Tones you should have more fans, you're the best
And your song changed my mind, get me high when I'm depressed
And I forget about stress when I'm out of my head
When all the talk about another song, forgot what he said
And it changed me to know that someone found my inner track
And every time someone said Rock Bottom he'd think of that
I would step off the stage, they would reach for a pat
So my favorite rappers live and I would leap in the crowd
Tabs told me write as many as I want
And I had some shit to get off my chest with this one
Roll the next blunt now cuz we jackin' the grids
I take it back in the day, when I rap they relate
