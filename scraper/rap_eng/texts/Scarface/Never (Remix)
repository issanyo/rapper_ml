*This is Scarface's song 'Never' interjected with Sha Stimuli's rhymes

[Verse One] [Scarface]:
I would, never violate the codes of the streets
And I would never make a promise, that I know I couldn't keep
And I would, never testify, cop out for a plea
Or surrender information on my boys to the police
And you could...

[Sha Stimuli]:
Never tell me I ain't study my craft
Or never tell me I ain't bustin' my ass
I'm everywhere, you never there
I'm never scared, the women lovin' my swag
I never wife 'em I'm never comin' too fast
Yo, let's go 'Face

[Scarface]:
Never catch me on the block without a strap
And I would, never pull it out unless I'm bouts to black
And I could, never forget my homies dyin for they scratch
Forever pourin out liquor for 'em, God send 'em back
And I'll...

[Sha Stimuli]:
Never look back I'll only reflect
I might have remorse but I'll never regret
Never claim no set, only promises I only make threats
Never set up and I was never upset
I get even man

[Scarface]:
Never shed tears, my heart is like a stone now
Never thought I'd live to see 21 look I'm grown now
Never say never they tell me all the time
Cause never means it's forever, but it's never crossed my mine
And I'll, never go broke, I promise I'mma shine
Never come short on my issue, I'm on it every time
And I'll, never be past it, you better gimme me mine
It's my money, and I want it, every motherfuckin dime

[Sha Stimuli]:
Never try to be somethin' that I'm not
Damn, never not givin' everything I got and
Never talk shit I can't back up
Never fall in love cause I stand up
And everything I do
Never slip, stumble, stagger or take a trip
But never stop, I won't brake for shit
Never trouble myself or my team for tryin' to make a hit
Never compromise or water down the way I spit

[Scarface]:
Never forgot all my struggles in the past
And I could, never forget how to hustle for my cash
And I will, never forget how I felt when I saw Brad
Take that first breath and from then, I knew I had to mash
And it could, never be said I went out like a ho
Never been punked, I'll never let it slide, never let it go
Never ever, never ever ever no
Get on my level ho, or get a shovel ho

[Sha Stimuli]:
I never fold like laundry
Never fast like Gandhi
Never lose my cool like Fonzi
Never let no haters harm me
I never lose sight of how poverty felt
I never stop bein' proud of myself
I'm too ill, huh

[Scarface]:
It's never any question for my manhood I get down
I'll never switch, never snitch, never sit down
I'll never hesitate to squeeze a nigga six rounds
I'll never squat to take a piss, who's the bitch now

[Sha Stimuli]:
I never step on nobody's toes if somebody owes me
Let that body know that shotty blows that he gotta go
Never walk with a snotty nose like I got a cold
But I am kinda sick, never stop the flow, always rock a show

[Scarface]:
I never ran, I never will, I ain't never scared
It's in my bloodline, the realest nigga ever bred
And that's some of the realest shit that I done ever said
And I can die but through my lyrics, I ain't never dead

[Sha Stimuli]:
Never forget how that crash felt when I was a kid
Never forget how that call felt, "They murdered Big"
Never thought that I'd be usin' mad words to live
Nah, that's a lie, never thought I'd be workin' a gig

[Scarface]:
I'll never disrespect my momma, never disrespect her momma neither
I'll never turn my back on Jesus
I'll never get caught off in the system, cause I believe a
Man that follows man, ain't no man, and I'm a leader
Never go turncoat my nigga, I could never trade
I'll never cross my homies out, that I ain't how I'm made
And I never had not one regret, on how I was raised
I'm from the ghetto, where I slung and rapped it every day
Never knew no other way, this ain't gon' never change
Never gon' bite my tongue, FUCK what nigga say

[Sha Stimuli]:
I never ever pray, unless I'm thankful
Never askin' for some shit I can't handle so help me God

[Scarface]:
I'll never talk a nigga down, do yo' thang dawg~!
Never hate a dude for tryin, that's insane dawg
Get yo' motherfuckin money, that's the thang dawg
Too many homies dyin young, feel my pain y'all

[Sha Stimuli]:
Never dream without makin' that shit reality
Never wanted nobody settin' my salary
I never felt so alive, this ain't just rap to me
You'll never nobody that's similar comin' after me
