[Intro: Scarface]
Ugh, born in hell, is back

[Verse 1: 2Pac]
The motherfuckin' dust kicker, who can you trust?
Do you have the heart to see a nigga, before you bust?
My name is spoken on the tongues of so many foes
Bustin' motherfuckers out the box, I ain't even go!
Now how the hell do you explain, my claim to fame?
From doin' flicks to bustin' tricks out the fuckin' frame
Got these bitches on my jock, niggas on my block
Jealous ass suckers got 'em duckin' from my smokin' Glock
And bustin' niggas asses to stay alive
Skinny ass player watchin' bigger motherfuckers fry
They ask me how I’m livin? Haaah I’m a hustler
Buckin' busters 'til they die
Now it's on in the ghetto you ain't heard?
Niggas got they AKs headin' for the 'burbs
Aimin' at them skin head bitches let it rain
Givin' 'em a wet welcome to the house of pain

[Hook]
House of pain, house of pain, house of pain
Welcome to the house of pain
House of pain, house of pain, house of pain
Welcome to the house of pain

[Verse 2: Stretch]
Yo, I’m hunting down this nigga and he knows so he’s stressin'
He better count his blessings, and get ready for this lesson
'Cause Stretch about to teach him, when I reach him with the MAC
And lay that ass down on this mothafuckin' back jack
Slack is somethin' that a nigga don't take
His moms run the church, so I'ma see her at his fuckin' wake
Make way, that nigga play me the other day
I'm walking with my son, and the nigga had somethin' to say
Aiy, the nigga tried to diss boy, he got it twisted
He should've watch Americans Most, I'm listed
For killin' mothafuckers like him
So I'ma bring him to the House of Pain and kill him with a grin
Flim, flam, goddamn, I'm not the one
Before I'ma choke him and smoke him
I'ma smack him with my fuckin' gun
Son you've made your last mistake and I don't know ya name
But welcome to the House of pain

[Hook]
House of pain, house of pain, house of pain
Welcome to the house of pain
House of pain, house of pain, house of pain
Welcome to the house of pain

(*Coughing*)

[Verse 3: Notorious B.I.G.]
The country bud got me chokin'
I'm on a mission to the point that motherfuckers think I'm smokin'
Yeah that sick nigga Biggie wit' the 8 shot flip
Wit the extra clip for that extra shit
Don't you know that killing is thrilling
All the blood spilling, is all a part of drug dealing
A born gangster my daddy was a thug
Had a .38 with the hollow point slug
So when he licked shots
Niggas dropped quicker than a bootlegger sells his liquor
A little nigga tried to squeeze .22's in my Reebok shoes
Payin' dues, while kids was on their one's and two's
Now I'm much older, colder, fuck a holster
Got the MAC-11 swingin' from my shoulder
It's a damn shame I got to put my momma through the strain
I'm livin' in a house of pain

[Hook]
House of pain, house of pain, house of pain
Welcome to the house of pain
House of pain, house of pain, house of pain
Welcome to the house of pain
House of pain, house of pain, house of pain
Welcome to the house of pain
House of pain, house of pain, house of pain
Welcome to the house of pain
