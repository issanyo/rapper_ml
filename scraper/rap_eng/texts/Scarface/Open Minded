Intro:
So what's up now nigga? (BOOM)

DMG:
Trapped up inside another bad day
This fuckin' chronic got me demonic effecting me in a bad way
I'm on some motherfuckin' kill shit
I got hot flashes of me fuckin' you up nigga this some real shit
I'm on another level total
Forget decisions I'm full of vengence can't any nigga hold me
Cause only, I can do what no one does it better
I decapitate niggas wearin' cashmere sweaters
(Let us) Get into some shit that niggas know about from
East to west to north to south no doubt
Every city got their niggas from they hoods
And some from my hood I'm a give one up to my hood
It's the M.P.L.S. yiggy yes y'allin'
Niggas heard me stomp from Houston to Saint Balling
Callin' to the ring if you think you can step
And get your motherfuckin' shirt wet (nigga)

Scarface:
I got a million ways and one that you can die by
But I prefer to use my gun so you die by
The penetration of a hydroshock
And ain't no comin' back from your death when I come at you nigga by your
Block
It's the return of the maniac
And I'm residing on the outskirts of life somebody bring me back
I'm goin' crazy in this motherfucka
I got my pistol out the dresser about to blaze one of these motherfuckers
I gives a fuck about your bad momma
Cause nigga all I need is a reason to wipe you out
I don't believe you wanna ride on it
Cause if you ride then you gon die I'll put the southside on it
This ain't no motherfuckin' gag bitch
Just a nigga about to show your ma dukes
Cause when I get down I put the shit down for my whole set
Put my feet down and leave you hoes wet
I brake these niggas off a proper dollar
I get the feeling that you wanting my shit so now I gots to stop ya
There ain't no love for my opposition
Cause they opposition I knock they monkey ass up out position

Willie D:
He wanted drama so I gave it to him
A blood puddle on his way to the ghetto is my rebuttal
The box cutter has his ass beggin' for mercy G
I flipped that out and gave him open heart surgury
It ain't no thang to me to kill a motherfucker
I'll do that shit again if I can watch your mammy suffer
I've had enough of police I ain't scarred
The next time I see the boys in blue they gonna be the boys in red
Cause they gonna bleed yes indeed
Motherfuckers took my weed!
Give me your mind and I'm a open it
Name a law and I've already broken it
Cause I don't give a fuck about the system Willie Dennis
Couldn't give a fuck about the people livin' in it
I know a lot of niggas think that they can get with me
But don't you flush it down the toilet bring that shit to me
And get your ass tore up from the floor up
I got some shit that'll make your motherfuckers throw up
When I attack there's no rewindin'
I hit your ass in the brain with this thang and leave you open minded

Willie D talking:
And that ain't even the half. I laugh at the thought of a body bag. So all
You fools that got conflict. Y'all can suck my motherfuckin' dick!
