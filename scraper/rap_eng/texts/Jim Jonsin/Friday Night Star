She was a Friday night star
Everyone knew her name but the fame didn’t take her far
And she was in awe
Trying to imitate the lifestyle that she saw
And there was no cars
Living illusions
Dream illusive chasing cars
A tongue so harsh
She could persuade a million soldiers into the dark

So just wait up a minute lady
Pop them breaks for a minute you’re so mistaken
I say you look awfully shady
Or maybe you’re just contemplating a Friday night star
(shes a superstar)
A Friday night star
A Friday night star

Jessica, I’m thinking I could probably take her home and marry her
But everything I keep on hearing makes me scared of her
And now I know I probably should have never messed with her
But she got me grabbing my coat and keys and I did I did
I get on the express way and speed to her crib, her crib
I just loose control everytime I see all those hips and lips
And it feels just like an evil deed
But I slip, I slip

[Hook]
So just wait up a minute lady
Pop them breaks for a minute you’re so mistaken
I say you look awfully shady
Or maybe you’re just contemplating a Friday night star
(shes a superstar)
A Friday night star
A Friday night star

Yeah,yeah
She’s dressed for the Friday night lights
With her boots zipped up, her jeans tight
Wondering, tryna find the right type
But there’s dogs round here and they might bite
I sit back, then stare in amazement
As these girls go awfully crazy
They don’t know me
But they know that they play my song on the radio station
And I climb on top of the stage
Wait for the beat when it drop, then I sing
Everybody get poured up, then drink
Then by the end of the night they faint
After the pause, I fade to the dark
Everybody please give a round of applause
I leave to the car, she waits for me patiently by the bar
