Verse 1:
I see everybody around but it feels like we're in privat
I know you want me so bad cause you just can't seem to hide it

The lights are moving to the rhythm of the music
When we're together everything just comes together, baby
So inspired by the moment we can lose it
I hope you're ready

Refrain:
As long as I see the strobe lights, I'm dancin' all night long
When we're together baby
I'm feelin' alright, you got me all night

So tell the DJ play it
(all night, all night, all night, all night, all night night night)
So tell the DJ play it
(all night, all night, all night, all night, all night night night)
So tell the DJ play it

Verse 2:
Tonight, the admission is free, now we're shuttin' the club down
We're movin' out to the streets, all we got left is love now

Feel my troubles fade into the rhythm of your heartbeat
When we're together everything just comes together, baby
Every motion calls your name, baby once you see me
And I hope your ready

Refrain:
As long as I see the strobe lights, I'm dancin' all night long
When we're together baby
I'm feelin' alright, you got me all night

So tell the DJ play it
(all night, all night, all night, all night, all night night night)
So tell the DJ play it
(all night, all night, all night, all night, all night night night)
So tell the DJ play it

Verse 3:
And you made me forget all my worries, helped me put the past behind
Around us the world's in a hurry, while we stand still in time

The lights are moving to the rhythm of the music
When we're together everything just comes together, baby
So inspired by the moment we can lose it
I hope you're ready

Refrain:
As long as I see the strobe lights, I'm dancin' all night long
When we're together baby
I'm feelin' alright, you got me all night

So tell the DJ play it
(all night, all night, all night, all night, all night night night)
So tell the DJ play it
(all night, all night, all night, all night, all night night night)
So tell the DJ play it

Verse 4:
It's only you and me together
And this feeling's so strong
Wish I could stay like this forever

Refrain':
So tell the DJ play it
(all night, all night, all night, all night, all night night night)
So tell the DJ play it
(all night, all night, all night, all night, all night night night)
So tell the DJ play it
