[Verse 1]
These winters
Can get a little hazy
But I got the remedy
I don't mind trekin through the cold
Because we can start a fire, baby
I'm tryna take your breath away
And as the fog starts rollin in, your fears evaporate
And the cold air's slowly drifting away
And I feel the rush up in my brain

[Hook]
Cause with every single breath
You'll come alive
There's a rainbow inside your head
So just spread and fly
Girl I can get you so wet
Just close your eyes
Cuz ever since I met you, baby
I wanted to get you high

[Verse 2]
I can't help it, no
'Cause baby girl, you're lookin' fine
So come on and open your mind, yeah
Just roll it up, I'll take you higher, baby
'Cause a dime like you could use a dime
And I got the wings to make fly
And as the fog starts rollin in, your fears evaporate
And the cold air's slowly drifting away
And I feel the rush up in my brain

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
I see you lookin at me like you're tryna get wit it, but
I'm finna make you work harder to get it, cause
Ever since you came up into my vision, love
I been a mess, and my friends think I'm trippin' up
Sippin' and smokin' and actin' ridiculous
Hittin' the spliff and you're rollin' the windows up
I probably should've just taken a little puff
Listen up, you are the chick thinkin of
(I confess I need)
That's why I'm tokin' up, baby, not getting drunk
(a little sess and weed)
I'll do whatever you want if you give it up
(so come and rescue me)
Stroke it while singing, and switching the rhythm up
(it's your destiny)
You know I'm not gonna stop 'til you get enough
(When you're next to me)
Taking you down, and then I'm gonna lick you up
(I'm in ecstasy, you're a sex machine)
Girl if you wanna get higher just take a puff
(and the recipe is to get you high)

[Hook]
