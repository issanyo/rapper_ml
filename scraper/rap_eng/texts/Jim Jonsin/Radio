[Bridge]
I be on the hotline, like e'rryday
Makin' sure the DJ know what I want him to play
You know I got my top back and my beat low
Rockin' my stunna shades and turnin' up my radio
Turn up my radio, radio, radio....

[Chorus]
I think I'm in love with my radio
'Cause it never lets me down
And I fall in love with my stereo
Whenever I hear that sound
(Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
Whenever I hear that sound
(Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
Whenever I hear that sound

[Verse 1]
You're the only one that Papa allowed to hang out in my room
With the door closed, we'd be alone
And mama never freaked out when she heard it go 'BOOM!'
'Cause she knew we were in the zone

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Hold him in my arms and look out of my window
(Under the moonlight)
And he be keepin' me calm so I'd never let him go
He's got a place in my heart

[Chorus]
I think I'm in love with my radio
'Cause it never lets me down
And I fall in love with my stereo
Whenever I hear that sound
(Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
Whenever I hear that sound
(Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
Whenever I hear that sound

[Versus 2]
When I get into my car, turn it uh-up, uh-up
Then I hear vibrations all up in my truh-unk, uh-unk
And the bassline be rattlin' through my see-eat, ee-eats
Then that crazy feeling starts happeni-ing- i-ing, OH!

[Pre-Chorus 2]
I get butterflies when I hear the DJ (Playing the stuff I like)
And I fall deeper in love with every song he plays
He's got a place in my heart

[Chorus]
I think I'm in love with my radio
'Cause it never lets me down
And I fall in love with my stereo
Whenever I hear that sound
(Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
Whenever I hear that sound
(Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
Whenever I hear that sound

[Bridge]
I be on the hotline, like e'rryday
Makin' sure the DJ know what I want him to play
You know I got my top back and my beat low-oh
Rockin' my stunna shades and turnin' up my radio-oh
Turn up my radio, radio, radio....

[Chorus]
I think I'm in love with my radio
'Cause it never lets me down
And I fall in love with my stereo
Whenever I hear that sound
(Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
Whenever I hear that sound
(Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
Whenever I hear that sound

[Outro]
(Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
(Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
Oh, ooh, whoa, whoa
Oh, ooh, whoa, whoa
Oh, ooh, whoa, whoa, ooh
