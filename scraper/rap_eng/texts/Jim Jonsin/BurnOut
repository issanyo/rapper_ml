You know what they say
Living in the fast lane
Bitches and champagne
Your flame gon' burn out (burn out)
Fuck it, lets just see how it turn out (turn out)

[Verse 1]

I can never stop being myself
Never stop chasing this change
Never stop smoking this kush
'Bout to take off like a plane
I'm addicted to that fast lane living
But who isn't, when you came up in my district
All of these days up in my studio, blowing out my mind
Fucking bitches, writing rhymes
It's the story of my life
It's a new way of hustling
So used to struggling
Lost fake friends but that money started coming in
Yeah, and now the boys gonna represent
Doing everything, major haters stacking precedence
And it's diligence
Stack it's the millions
So my mind is militant
When I say I'm killing shit, bitch

[Verse 2]

Demerick is the name that my mama gave me
I'm rollin' with a nigga, this game will never change me
Yes, yes indeed
Shall I proceed and continue to keep it G?
Easily
There's nothing left to do on this level that I'm on
Time to elevate, fight heavy weight, bring it on
It's that same old song, been singing for so long
Time to get paid
Blow up like the world trade
And as long as the good times outweigh the bad
And the haters talk about what they should of had
I don't get mad, nigga, I just get heated
Then I'm going to beat the odds 'till they turn even
Bitch

[Verse 3]

I see the world of this rap shit
Get money off this rapping
Moved to the hills, but still far from relaxing
In the studio creating like a blacksmith
I'm my own boss, so y'all could go ass kiss
Burn the candle on both ends
Like I see no end, 'till this shits broken
I'ma bust it open
And let 'em deal with it
See life's so much better when you're being real with it
Good smoke, the roll it's, champagne for bitches
It's on the ride, a gun for the highest to start bidding
It's the free lancer, romancer
She got questions, but I got no answers
Bitch
