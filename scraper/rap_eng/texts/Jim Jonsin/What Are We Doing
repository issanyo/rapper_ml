[Refrain]
Its been a long time coming and the clock says a quarter to 4
I'm feeling like its now or never and your body's telling me its a go
So what are we doing? What are we doing here?
What are we doing? What are we doing here?
What are we doing? What are we doing here?
What are we doing? What are we doing here?
What are we doing?

[Verse 1]
On a late night weekend showcase event
Kinda liked you at first but I noticed your friend
So I got my folk to approach both of them
And they both came over and poured up some Hen
And we ain't say much but we spoke
Cause you don't have to speak when you know
Their eyes said to me "Systems go"
Its about that time we should go
So allow me to flow as I propose a toast
To the good life, on a good night we go, grab a bottle and go
Tell her hold on, yes a beautiful night, colorful Kodak photo
But as soon as you enter the room I guess you froze

[Refrain]

[Verse 2]
Its the end of the week but the first of the month
When the moon gets full but the night is still young
With a crowd like this you dont know where you'll end up
So I just play it cool like the cubes in my cup
Huh...but then you came through tryna body me up
And I ain't know what you was thinkin' but your eyes said enough
And everything we felt was obviously lust
Which I thought was kinda cool I ain't gonn' bluff
But look at the clock its about time that I duck
Outta the door dont mean to be in a rush but later
You can hit me up so you hit me up shoes at the door
Smoke in the air, temperature's up
But I guess when the lights went out it froze you up

[Refrain]
