[Intro: Slim Thug]
Geyeah
Slim Thugga
Boss Hogg Outlawz, Jim Jonsin, ha
Representin this Texas mayne
Back

[Hook: set to A Flock of Seagulls "I Ran"]
I run, the streets all night and day (the hood love Thug)
Cause I still run, the streets all night and day
(If you tryin to find me)
(I rep for my city, go hard for the hood)
(Still posted on the block, what's good?)
And I run, the streets all night and day (ha)
I can't stay away

[Slim Thug]
They don't make too many niggas like me
Bonifide hustler, certified G
Still got that work if you got the right fee
You thankin shit fake? Well nigga come see
It's bigger than the jewels, it's bigger than the cars
It's bigger than the fact that we fuckin rap stars
The street niggas know me, these boys got my contacts
Knowin any given minute I can come back
I put a bitch on I-10 and tell her run dat
Give her ten and tell her don't brang nuttin back
I'm still in the hood, I can't leave the streets
It's in my blood, I'm a thug 'til I be deceased

[Hook]

[Slim Thug]
It's hot on my block, somebody turn the fan on
I've been paid, I'm just tryin to turn my mans on
And get my bread strong, streets miss me when I'm gone
I "Put On" for my city like Jeezy's song
Please believe me homes; matter fact check my stats
I ain't drop in three years, but I'm back
Where the money at? That's the first question
You better pack a strap; that's the first lesson
Hard times got the whole United States stressin
I'm writin a book - "How to Survive in a Recession"
Mr. Obama, we so tired of sellin crack
If you lookin for me ask the streets where I'm at

[Hook]

[Slim Thug]
It's home sweet home where the D-boys roam
Movin stone for stone, or zone for zone
All night gettin it on 'til 6 in the morn'
The shit I'm smokin on, stronger then cologne
You can probably smell the smoke through your headphones
If you still broke better get your bread long
Call me on that burner cause them feds on my phone
And I'mma run the streets 'til I'm under my headstone

[Hook]
