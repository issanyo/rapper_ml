Verse:
It's like, chasing shadows
I never seem to win
Just when I'm over you
I feel myself falling again
No hope of grace
I'm loosing faith
All I can do is pray..

Can u hear me
Can u hear me ohh..
Can u hear me

Chorus:
Cuz it feels like the weight of the world
Have the angels turned their back on me
It feels like the weight of the world
Can't let go of what we use to be
And though my cries have gone unheard and I'm left on my knees
It feels like the weight of the world
Cuz I still remember how it felt
When u loved me..when u loved me oh..

Verse:
I got no rule to follow
Left with no eyes to see
No love to borrow
Since u left I can barely breathe
In my lonely place and it can't be traced
All I can do is pray..

Can u hear me
Can u hear me ohh
Can u hear me

Chorus:
It feels like the weight of the world
Have the angels turned their back on me
It feels like the weight of the world
Can't let go of what we use to be
And though my cries have gone unheard and I'm left on my knees
It feels like the weight of the world
Cuz I still remember how it felt
When u loved me..
When u loved me..

Bridge:
Love me again or set me free
Love me again
Love me again or set me free

Chorus:
It feels like the weight of the world
Have the angels turned their back on me
It feels like the weight of the world
Can't let go of what we use to be
And though my cries have gone unheard and I'm left on my knees
It feels like the weight of the world
Cuz I still remember how it felt
When u loved me..
You loved me oh..
Say u love me, again..
When u love me...
