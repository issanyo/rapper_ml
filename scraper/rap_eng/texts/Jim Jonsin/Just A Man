[Verse 1]
Maybe I'm foolish, maybe I'm blind
Maybe "I'm sorry"'s outta line
Maybe I'm selfish, I should've tried
You know I lost it, but I've been found

[Pre-Chorus 1]
I know I'm wrong
Baby, I'm wrong, so wrong
For letting you hurt so long
Ohh

[Pre-Chorus 2]
And I can't let you go, don't you know
Whatever it takes, I will do
I'm down on my knees
Begging you please

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm just a man, and you are my world
I'm half what I am, with you I am whole
'Cause I'm just a man, and you are my girl
Just give me a chance to bring my love home
I'm just a man
I'm just a man

[Verse 2]
Maybe I'm stupid, maybe I lied
Maybe I rushed us outta time
Maybe I felt it, I put up a fight
Holding emotion I shouldn't hide

[Pre-Chorus 1]
I know I'm wrong
Baby, I'm wrong, so wrong
For letting you hurt so long
Oh

[Pre-Chorus 2]
And I can't let you go, don't you know
Whatever it takes, I will do
I'm down on my knees
Begging you please

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm just a man, and you are my world
I'm half what I am, with you I am whole
'Cause I'm just a man, and you are my girl
Just give me a chance to bring my love home
I'm just a man

[Pre-Chorus 2]
But I won't let you go, don't you know
Whatever it takes, I will do?
I'm down on my knees
Begging you please

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm just a man, and you are my world
I'm half what I am, with you I am whole
'Cause I'm just a man, and you are my girl
Just give me a chance to bring my love home

[Outro]
I'm just a man, oh
I'm just a man, oh
I'm just a man, oh
Oh
I'm just a man
