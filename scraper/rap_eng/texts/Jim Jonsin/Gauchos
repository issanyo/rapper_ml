[Intro]
Yo, I'm not too long coming back from Atlanta. I'mma make sure Harlem
Gets to snap dancing

[Verse 1]
Harlem is my stylist, Harlem is my bully
Harlem is my veteran, Harlem is my rookie
I am Harlem's politician, Sharpton is my little nigga
Get high like Polo Grounds, and I treat y'all dudes like Hilfiger
Drop a G stack and and Porta Bella, now I am world hot
Vans on, pant leg up, you see the girl socks
Spongebob boxers, you can kiss my Squidward
She might call 150th, the hero, and some swishers

[Hook]
Harlem on that new shit
Harlem on that new shit
Harlem on that new shit
Ain't nobody ready to see
Harlem on that new shit
Walking like a golfer
Walking like a golfer
Walking like a golfer

GAUCHOOOOOOOOOOS!
Not a game, it's a sport
We can take it to the court, like...
GAUCHOOOOOOOOOOS!
Bobbing down the block in my Tiger Woods socks like....
GAUCHOS! (Oh!)
GAUCHOS! (Oh!)
GAUCHOS! (Oh!)
GAUCHOS! We're...
GAUCHOS! We're...
GAUCHOS! We're...
GAUCHOS! We're...
GAUCHOS! (Oh!)

[Verse 2]
Harlem is my temple, 115th and 8th flow
Harlem keep me laced and angry, USA be grateful
Harlem got the classiest, rappers be the nastiest
Many races, pretty faces, landmarks, and Charles
Grant on the west side, Faulst (?) up on the east
Streets safe and dangerous, porter on the streets
Great support system if your daughter is discreet
Say it to her father's face, you're getting slaughtered on the street
Like...

[Hook]
Harlem on that new shit
Harlem on that new shit
Harlem on that new shit
Ain't nobody ready to see
Harlem on that new shit
Walking like a golfer
Walking like a golfer
Walking like a golfer

GAUCHOOOOOOOOOOS!
Not a game, it's a sport
We can take it to the court, like...
GAUCHOOOOOOOOOOS!
Bobbing down the block in my Tiger Woods socks like....
GAUCHOS! (Oh!)
GAUCHOS! (Oh!)
GAUCHOS! (Oh!)
GAUCHOS! We're...
GAUCHOS! We're...
GAUCHOS! We're...
GAUCHOS! We're...
GAUCHOS! (Oh!)

[Verse 3]
You see me live on 1-3-5, I'm chilling at the Y
I'm the reason there's no season
Why you grilling, cause I'm fly high
Maybe I can define the sky
Like S-K-Y induced with that K-Y now you are mine, Pause
Dawg, you know they bringing that slang back
And if you got a gun then I suggest that you bang that
You ain't got no gun then homie you ain't never slang crack
I just suggest you keep the peace my nigga, where my gang at?

[Hook]
Harlem on that new shit
Harlem on that new shit
Harlem on that new shit
Ain't nobody ready to see
Harlem on that new shit
Walking like a golfer
Walking like a golfer
Walking like a golfer

GAUCHOOOOOOOOOOS!
Not a game, it's a sport
We can take it to the court, like...
GAUCHOOOOOOOOOOS!
Bobbing down the block in my Tiger Woods socks like....
GAUCHOS! (Oh!)
GAUCHOS! (Oh!)
GAUCHOS! (Oh!)
GAUCHOS! We're...
GAUCHOS! We're...
GAUCHOS! We're...
GAUCHOS! We're...
GAUCHOS! (Oh!)

GAUCHOS! We're...
GAUCHOS! We're...
GAUCHOS! We're...
GAUCHOS! (Oh!)
