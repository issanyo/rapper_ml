[Verse 1]
I know you think I be trippin'
Thinkin' I be playing you, be sayin' I ain't into you
Just take a second to listen
'Cause I ain't into laying with just anybody
Baby, I ain't trying to kill my body so soon

[Pre-Chorus]
Let me know you're worth it
Do you deserve a chance to
To touch, to feel my love?
'Cause ain't nobody perfect
Underneath the surface can you
Show me your love

[Chorus]
And when it's time
I won't even have to tell you so
You'll see the stars are shining the same
So take your time
'Cause love ain't got nowhere to go
It'll be way better if we wait
'Cause there's no such thing as too late
When you really love somebody you can wait
'Cause there's no such thing as too late

[Verse 2]
You told me you're different
You be always saying you ain't nothing like them other dudes
And judging from my intuition (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
You seem like somebody I could probably give myself to
Not so soon

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I want you to love me
Whenever you get that chance to
To touch, to feel my love
'Cause ain't nobody
'Cause ain't nobody perfect underneath the surface
Can you show me your love?

[Chorus]
And when it's time
I won't even have to tell you so
You'll see the stars all shining the same
So take your time
'Cause love ain't got nowhere to go
It'll be way better if we wait
'Cause there's no such thing as too late
When you really love somebody you can wait
'Cause there's no such thing as too late

[Bridge]
Listen to my heart
And I'll listen to yours
And if they say the same thing
Then I'll know we're ready
But until then we should be patient let's not start
But when we start, I promise you gon' love it baby

[Chorus]
And when it's time
I won't even have to tell you so
You'll see the stars all shining the same
So take your time
'Cause love ain't got nowhere to go
It'll be way better if we wait
'Cause there's no such thing as too late
When you really love somebody you can wait (don't ya think)
'Cause there's no such thing as too late
