[Intro: Pitbull]
Hey Gentlemen
It's like these boys
Wanna make music for the block
You know
For they hood
For they city

[Bridge: Pitbull and B.o.B]
Uh uh uh uh uhh uhh
(I'm tryin to make music for the world, you know)
Uh uh uh uh uhh uhh
(You feel me, right B.o.B)
Oh Oh
(This one we came up with)

[Verse 1: Pitbull]
I got up today
And my flight was late
On my way to L.A
I jumped up on a plane
And put on my shades
And threw on my head phones
I was vibing to this beat
That made me move my feet
Boy that thang was sticky
And then I heard this (melody)
The dopest one Ive ever seen
Something out the usual
So Mr. Pilot please
I think I got a hit on me
Hurry to the studio

[Hook: B.o.B]
I'll play across the world
(across the world)
Across the world
Ill play across the world
(across the world)
Across the world
Ill play across the world
Uh uh uh uh uhh uhh
Uh uh uh uh uhh uhh
Ooh Oh

[Verse 2: B.o.B]
Well I got up today
Put some gas in my tank
To make it to the studio
And then I heard this beat
It made me move my feet
Hell yeah that thing was super dope
And then I sang this (melody)
The dopest one Ive ever seen
Something out the usual
So Mr. Engineer
Turn up the auto-tune
So ill be on the radio

[Hook: B.o.B]
I'll play across the world
(across the world)
Across the world
I'll play across the world
(across the world)
Across the world
I'll play across the world
Uh uh uh uh uhh uhh
Uh uh uh uh uhh uhh
Ooh Oh

[Verse 3: Pitbull]
Been around the world
Same old songs, Now on stage
After bras and thongs
Long way from what I came from
Fighting in the club
For just singing a song
Now my passports full
Im outta pages
New places, new faces
New fans, all ages
Black, Pink, Purple, Orange, Caucasians
Latino, European and Asian
And Havana knew all my lyrics
It was Amazing!
They spoke Spanish
Que ma carne, ni ma carne
Asi viene el sandwich
I guess its true what they say
Music is the universal language
Its a true blessing you know
To travel the globe

[Hook: B.o.B]
I'll play across the world
(across the world)
Across the world
I'll play across the world
(across the world)
Across the world
I'll play across the world
