My day intel's of making chips, bill gates
I'm try'na get my pockets fat, uncle phils face
Fresh prince i'm in bel-air
Burning trees with my nigga, frank
Lucas how i do this, what that mean?, that mean i'm getting bank

Watch my alpaca, no shoes in my mansion
Billion dollar thug shit, young richard branson
Pull up in 10 astons, i wanna talk to sampson
With fine girls like howard's campus yelling my anthem

This is my most expensive flow right now
Gon head pop the champagne
Oooo big money
This is my most expensive flow right now
Pull up in a car i can't name
Helicopters on the sun-deck
Billion dollar thug shit


My suit tailored, no wiz khalif
All these rappers bank weak
Make em rinse my feet
And kiss my ring to pay homage how i diss the beat
And fuck rapping if i'm only getting 60 G's
I got bigger dreams
Than dr king in a time machine
I need a jet, semi submarine
Pull up in a phantom, don't you think i'm handsome
All i need is leila lopes yelling my anthem

This is my most expensive flow right now
Gon head pop the champagne
Ooo big money
This is my most expensive flow right now
Pull up in a car i can't name
Helicopters on the sun-deck
Billion dollar thug shit

Everybody put ya motherfucking glass up
If you feeling good put ya hands up
All my fine ladies put ya hands up
All my trill niggas yea gon and stand up

Uh if you balling put ya cash up
Uh this that billion dollar thug shit
Uh b ba ba billion dollar thug shit
Yea this that billion dollar thug shit

This is my most expensive flow right now
Gon head pop the champagne
Ooo big money
This is my most expensive flow right now
Pull up in a car i can't name
Helicopters on the sun-deck
Billion dollar thug shit
