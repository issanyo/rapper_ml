(Chorus)
I can't believe it girl
You wanna leave me girl
Let's fall in love again
Baby she was just a friend

And now I'm trying to call
But your phone is off
I know I broke your heart
But baby she was just a friend

Ain't nothing different here
No need to disappear
Let's fall in love again
Baby she was just a friend

Don't wanna fall apart
Tried to stop her from the start
I know I broke your heart
Baby she was just a friend

Verse 1
Open the door
I can hear your phone (ringing)
Plus your car is warm
So I know you just got home
I hear you breathing really hard
So close to you
Yet I'm so far
We gotta talk this thing over
You still haven't heard my story no

Baby I need you
Imma stand here until your heart agrees
To let me in

'cause nothing else matters
My life is ungathered
Don't let us be a memory

(Chorus)
Verse 2
Baby don't speak
Just sit (oh no don't leave)
See I'm not gonna let us not be together, no
There's not too much that I can say
Just wanted you to see my face
(so you can see the expression of my deepest regrets)
Saying oh oh oh oh oh, don't go, don't go
Let me in
'cause nothing else matters
My life is ungathered
Don't let us be a memory

(Chorus)
I don't want you to go
This ain't cool with me
I know I cut you deep
Emotionally
Don't nobody deserve this
So baby please believe me

I can't believe it girl
You wanna leave me girl
But baby she was just a friend

I'm trying to call
I know I broke your heart

(Chorus)
