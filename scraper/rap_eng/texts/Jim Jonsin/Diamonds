[Intro: Sarah Barthel]
You've got a mouthful of diamonds
And a pocket full of secrets

[Verse 1: A$AP Twelvyy]
Comic book and guns, comic books and guns
Watchin' Power, livin' Belly
Ghost-like Tommy Bunns
I'ma conquer what I vision, bet my time gon' come
I'm Tetsuo with a Tommy gun
Paparazzi pop up where my mami from
Prolly hit a lobby with my posse drunk
Sippin' on Bacardi, take a shot of rum
Pissin' in the elevator, still don't give a fuck
Gold grill, black mask, still ain't switchin' up
'Member niggas called me Diddy, I was wreakin' havoc
Threw the Glock up in the river, it was too dramatic
I'm a shooter, fuck my sneaker fashion
Fantasize about a week on acids
Spazzin' when the reefer's passin'

[Chorus: Sarah Barthel & A$AP Rocky]
Mothafucka, know what I'm talkin' 'bout
You've got a mouth full of diamonds
Oh, and a heart that's made of gold
With a mouth full of diamonds
And a pocket full of secrets
Oh, his eyes was made of stone
Pockets full of secrets, know what I'm sayin'?
You've got a mouth full of diamonds
Oh, and we all came here to go
Life is what you make it
And a pocket full of secrets
Know what I'm talkin' 'bout?
Go, go, oh

[Verse 2: A$AP Rocky]
Fancy teeth and jeans, fancy teeth and jeans
Iâ€™ve seen some shit you wouldn't believe that made me leave the scene
Appreciate the late rappers, paved the way rappers
I think back to backpackers and the wave cappers
'Cause now I hate rappers, hate today's rappers
Hate these fake rappers, lame fashion closet gangsta (uhh) rappers
And shout outs my nigga Riley, 'member Gangstalicious?
It was gangstas kissin' gangstas if you paid attention
Before my shit was even out you couldn't wait to get it
But now the shit I'm puttin' out gon' make you think to get it
Take a minute, God's present 'cause I'm way too gifted
So next album fuck around and make you wait 'til Christmas

[Chorus: Sarah Barthel & A$AP Rocky]
Mothafucka, know what I'm talkin' 'bout
You've got a mouth full of diamonds
Oh, and a heart that's made of gold
With a mouth full of diamonds
And a pocket full of secrets
Oh, his eyes was made of stone
Pockets full of secrets, know what I'm sayin'?
You've got a mouth full of diamonds
Oh, and we all came here to go
Life is what you make it
And a pocket full of secrets
Know what I'm talkin' 'bout?
Go, go, oh
