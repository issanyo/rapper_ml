[Intro]
The problem with love is, with love is, with love is
The problem with love is, with love is, with love is

[Verse 1]
Calculating on this equation ever since
You left me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me
Tell me how could you leave me hanging
Without any netting, netting to catch my fall?
It's so good when you're winning
Like your first night in your new house that ain't rented
Or a hot day in an S Class with the windows tinted, oh oh

[Pre-Chorus]
And there's no rebound that could solve this now
Just read the warning sticker, it says that

[Chorus]
The problem with love is, with love is, with love is
So hard to live without it, without it
The problem with love is, with love is, with love is
So hard to live without it, without it

[Refrain]
Like when it's gone, gone, gone, gone, gone, gone, gone, gone away, gone away
Like when it's gone, gone, gone, gone, gone, gone, gone, gone away, gone away

[Verse 2]
Thought it was over but it's the only the beginning of heartbreak
Break, break, break, break, break, break me
Break me out of these chains shackling me to the thought of you, thought of you
It's so hard now without it
Like your BlackBerry shut off when you're trying to live without it
Only times ten, lost your best friend, put that together and

[Pre-Chorus]
And there's no price tag that could buy this back
Nobody told me that before I fell

[Chorus]
The problem with love is, with love is, with love is
So hard to live without it, without it
The problem with love is, with love is, with love is
So hard to live without it, without it

[Refrain]
Like when it's gone, gone, gone, gone, gone, gone, gone, gone away, gone away
Like when it's gone, gone, gone, gone, gone, gone, gone, gone away, gone away

[Bridge]
The problem with love, oh woah
So hard to live without it, without it
The problem with love
Wish somebody would've told me, yeah
So hard to live without it, without it

[Refrain]
Like when it's gone, gone, gone, gone, gone, gone, gone, gone away, gone away
Like when it's gone, gone, gone, gone, gone, gone, gone, gone away, gone away

[Chorus]
The problem with love is, with love is, with love is
So hard to live without it, without it
The problem with love is, with love is, with love is
So hard to live without it, without it

[Refrain]
Like when it's gone, gone, gone, gone, gone, gone, gone, gone away, gone away
Like when it's gone, gone, gone, gone, gone, gone, gone, gone away, gone away
