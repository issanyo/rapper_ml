[Intro: Pitbull]
Mr. Worldwide
Across the world
Let's ride
Dale

[Verse 1]
I wake up every morning and see your face
Lying right beside me it fills the space
In my heart
I can't live without you
Don't wanna figure right how to
And every time I lay my head down to sleep
The emptiness inside of me starts to beat
So loud
I can't hear the sound
Do you hear it? For you

[Chorus]
I fall in love all over again
Each time I lay my eyes on you, I pretend
I feel so helpless, without you
Feel so helpless, without you
It takes a piece of me each time you leave
I feel it in my chest, so hard to breathe
I feel so helpless, without you
Feel so helpless, without you

[Verse 2]
I witness every trick you got up your sleeve
But still somehow you keep on surprising me
I'm yours
I can't live without you
Don't wanna figure right how to
Every time I see you, I feel like I
Could be the luckiest man in the world, why try
To fight it
There's no need to hide it
Because, you know

[Chorus]

[Bridge: A.J.]
Feels like I, fall apart
Every time; where do I start?
I'm so helpless without you
Without you

[Verse 3: Pitbull]
Every time I close my eyes
You're the first thing that runs to my mind
Everywhere I go, I see you, hear you, feel you
I just wanna be near you and heal you
Last thing you said is, "How dare you"
First thing I said is, "I'm sorry"
Now I'm sitting here helpless, man; same old story
Now she's brokenhearted, time heals all the wounds
She said, "Not this time", it's true, everyone plays a fool
And that fool is me, because I foolishly
Took advantage of a woman who loved me

[Chorus]
