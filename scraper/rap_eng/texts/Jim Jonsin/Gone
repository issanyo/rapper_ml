[Hook: Leroy Sanchez]
I know you've been gone, gone, gone
I know you've been gone, gone, gone
I know you've been gone, gone, gone
But are you missing me?
I know you're missing me

[Verse 1: JT Kidd]
I'm looking in the mirror, and I feel helpless
I don't know what help is
Cause I push everyone aside, like I'm selfish
Cause I'm so determined to hurry up and see the spotlight
Meanwhile I'm backstage, thinking about taking my life
I'm sorry that I'm always gone, rapping or acting, to help take away from the pain
I'm sorry that I won't let another person hurt me again
I stood in the cold and I stood in the rain
And I would hear people talk and they were saying
That they didn't believe me, so how could I not show them differently?
I need to prove a failure isn't what I'm meant to be
This doesn't make sense to me
Cause someone will reach out to me, then I'll regret cutting them off instantly
But I never meant to push away the ones I care about
I know I always was gone, can we talk it out?
I guess not, so I'm forced to write this song
But am I wrong?
It doesn't matter cause everyone is always screaming Austin you're always


[Hook]

Bridge
And hey hey hey
It's been so long since you've gone away


[Verse 2: JT Kidd]
4 years, if you want me to clarify
That's the moment when I was most terrified, but not scared to die
Isn't it ironic?
The one who said they care, left faster than Sonic?
As if I don't feel pain, I'm not bionic
I was just a lonely kid with dreams of being an iconic
Again isn't that ironic?
Cause I was never wanted
I know it's crazy that someone who's always smiling can really feel like this, ain't it?
Well, this is my life, I don't know if it's too late to save it
And, even though I feel like my life is constantly fading
This isn't a downfall cause a beast has awaken
I just wanted to make people happy, but they never let me
Go back to that one song that I made I guess I'm ready
I just wanted to do right, but apparently I'm wrong
I guess that you'll get your wish of me leaving you alone
When I am gone
