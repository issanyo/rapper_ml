[Verse 1]
Would've gave you all my love
Wanted to give you everything that you ever could need (Anything that you'd need, boy)
You was just spending all your time chasing money boy (What)
What about loving boy? (About love)
Don't you want love?
See I was just hanging 'round
Cause the thought that soon you'd see
All of this woman I am
What you get when you messing with me
(I ain't no average woman)
You chose to give up on the possibility
Of love
Forever

[Chorus]
All that I have is my heart
(All that I have is my heart)
It's here to give to you
(Willing and I'm waiting, just tell me what's up)
If you ain't ready babe
(If you ain't ready babe)
If you ain't ready babe
(If you ain't ready babe)
I can't wait around

[Verse 2]
And I tried all kinds of reasons
To make my heart believe
That you're not the one for me
But I
I can't find one reason
Why I
Shouldn't give
My heart to you
Boy
I've been trying to give you time
(Give you time)
Lets you see what's in my heart
(My heart)
I swear I feel it's all in vain
(In vain)
Sometimes loving you is so hard
Still can't give up on
The yearning inside to want you
So

[Chorus]
All that I have is my heart
(All that I have is my heart)
It's here to give to you
(Willing and I'm waiting, just tell me what's up)
If you ain't ready babe
(If you ain't ready babe)
If you ain't ready babe
(If you ain't ready babe)
I can't wait around
I'm here for you

[Bridge]
I want you, I want you
(Don't you want to feel my love?)
Why can't you be with it, babe?
(Don't you want to hold me close?)
I want you, I want you
Baby but I
Can't wait around
Can't wait around

[Chorus]
All that I have is my heart
(All that I have is my heart)
It's here to give to you
(Willing and I'm waiting, just tell me what's up)
If you ain't ready babe
(If you ain't ready babe)
If you ain't ready babe
(If you ain't ready babe)
I can't wait around
