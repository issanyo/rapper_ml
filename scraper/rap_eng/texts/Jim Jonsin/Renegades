[Intro]
"I got a gun for a mouth
And a bullet with your name on it
So don't breathe when I talk
'cause you haven't been spoken to
But a trigger for a heart beating blood from an empty pocket"

[Verse 1: Yelawolf]
I got blue wheels on a Harley blades
And a trail in the sunrays
Me and this lady, man
It's like church on a Sunday
I'm up from my rocker
But rock and roll is my papa
Raised me up on this gasoline
Billy Jean was my mama
Broken hearts turned to spoken art
My blood is like lava
Hard as a rock when I'm cold
Yet I can flow just like water
Grew up with people that's lethal
Grew up with hustling daughters
Mothers and fathers alike
Like it or not when you saw us
Live my life like a rebel
The devil's hot on my tracks
But I won't run from my demons
No, I embrace them in fact
So remember my spirit
When that Slumerican flag waves
From entrepreneurs to losers
Users and runaways

[Hook]
"But a trigger for a heart beating blood from an empty pocket"
From entrepreneurs, losers
To users and renegades
For factory workers, servers
And hustlers all the same
Single mothers and others
Nobodies, prisoners, no-names
For entrepreneurs, losers
To users and runaways

[Verse 2: Yelawolf]
Alcohol in my system to face the system of living
Marijuana rolled up, money on tables for women
For the strippers and divas
For those who didn't believe us
We went from single wide homes to homes with twenty foot ceilings
You may say you hate money, money isn't the issue with you
And all of your bullshit, you bullshit me and I miss you
Save your tears for your love, smile when love ain't around
I'm in the booth for my family, yes I'm holding you down
Keep pressing play every day
And if they hate, let them hate
Believe in you and that's all you can do, so fuck what they say
And remember my spirit when that Slumerican flag waves
From entrepreneurs, losers to users and renegades

[Hook]
"But a trigger for a heart beating blood from an empty pocket"
From entrepreneurs, losers
To users and renegades
For factory workers, servers
And hustlers all the same
Single mothers and others
Nobodies, prisoners, no-names
For entrepreneurs, losers
To users and runaways

[Outro]
"I got a gun for a mouth
And a bullet with your name on it
So don't breathe when I talk
'cause you haven't been spoken to
But a trigger for a heart beating blood from an empty pocket"
