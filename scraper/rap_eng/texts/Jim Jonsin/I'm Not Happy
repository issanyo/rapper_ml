(intro)
It's that time of the year again
I hate this time of the year
Because you ain't here
If i had to sum it up
I would say it just like this

(hook)
The sun is out
The block is hot
The club is jumpin'
But im not happy (no im not) happy
The girls are fly
They love my ride
But im not smilin'
'cause your not with me(so no im not) happy

(verse 1)
There was a time
When i would wake up
I would see your face
With no make-up
So beautiful (beautiful)
I miss it so
I would lay there
Thinkin to myself
"i could share my life
With nobody else"
Im emotional (emotional)
Girl i miss ya so
And even though

(hook)
The sun is out
The block is hot
The club is jumpin'
But im not happy (no im not) happy
The girls are fly
They love my ride
But im not smilin'
'cause your not with me(so no im not) happy

(verse 2)
My friday nights
Let me tell you what they look like
Blockbuster
Home alone
My movie night
It used to be
You and me(you and me)
I still got your picture
Hangin on my wall
(yes i do)last summer
In the bahamas
We had a ball
I wish i could rewind(rewind the hands of time)
To when you were mine
And even though

(hook)
The sun is out
The block is hot
The club is jumpin'
But im not happy (no im not) happy
The girls are fly
They love my ride
But im not smilin'
'cause your not with me(so no im not) happy

(bridge)x2
When you hear this
I hope you think about it
What we used to do and baby girl im sorry

(hook)
The sun is out
The block is hot
The club is jumpin'
But im not happy (no im not) happy
The girls are fly
They love my ride
But im not smilin'
'cause your not with me(so no im not) happy
(im not happy baby)
