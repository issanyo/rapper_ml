[Verse 1:]
Look me in eyes, while I'll make love to you girl
I wanna see your face I wanna know you feel it
And I won't be suprised because I know I feel it too girl
And I ain't into keeping secrects anymore

[Bridge:]
Cause I already know you love it babe, sometimes
I just wanna hear you say it... {yeaahh}
I want you to tell me just how good it feels tonight

[Chorus:]
Scream when your fed up
Scream when your sick and tired baby
Scream when you packed your bags and you walked up out the door {so let me hear you now}
Scream cause it feels good
Scream girl cause were making love like crazy
Scream when your calling my name out and you beggin me for more
