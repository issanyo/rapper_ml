[Verse 1]
Oh hi goddamn, brown Trans Am, I'm on fire
Loud as Cham', standing in the trap with these loud ass jems
Loud ass pipes, around these loud ass rims
God, God, look at my garage, Maserati cars
I can't see floors, this is no facade
Bitches go retard
Thousand pass we call that a picture in the yard
My paint keep falling, wet, wet shawty
"Shoulder Lean" money, I'm still balling
Got them soldiers in the tomb, pockets overload
Stack my money up and take a rocket to the moon
AK in the freezer, ready to put my glasses in the room
When I get with these hoes, first we pop it then we sue them
The hottest in the room, you know I won't lie
You know I'm sitting tall, you know I'm on fire

[Chorus]
Call me Young Dro Because I'm smoking on fire
Ball if you want, please shawty don't try
Players only live once, everybody going to die
So whatever shawty want, you know shawty going to buy
Aye, but shawty on fa, fa, fa, on fire
Shawty on fa, fa, fa, on fire
Shawty on fa, fa, fa, on fire
Shawty on fa, fa, fa, on fire
Call me Young Dro because I'm smoking on fire (X4)

[Verse 2]
I am Young Dro, what you telling me?
Pocket full of celery, I know how to be a player
I am V. Delery, nigga run up on me wrong know I get a felony
Damn fresh in the club, damn who they asking me?
Fellas be trying see my cars look like my Automart
Rovers in the crowd and I don't know how to call them up

I'ma start a hundred cars, race them up, paid them up
(Incomprehensible) grey in March, Uncle Blue in April, dimes in the stable
Gators I'ma blow them out
Tell the bitches if they don't behave I'ma throw them out
Drop top probable, make it rain on the Doppler
Grand Hustle king got a mafia, nigga what's popping?
I'm a beast, soon as I hit release mode
Pop your open like the Lamborghini doors
Young Dro I'm the "Best Thang Smokin
On fire, on fire, on fire, on fire

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Riding down Edgecombe, I just left Zaxby's
Chickens at the restaurant, chickens in my Chevy trunk
Classic, super straight, Dro you cannot duplicate
Nigga you ain't hustle till you sold it out the Super 8
Traveloid, super cake, do a hundred jazz up
Super strong kush got them coughing like the swap meet
(Incomprehensible)
Dro you say you spent a million on the jewelry
Who you lying to? Try who?
Nigga I will suffocate and bust the K
Show them how to cultivate, and buy a house with ocean state
Plus I say I'm real with the hustle I multicate
First they start biting, I require y'all muzzle they
Mouth is doubt me, eight mile high houses
Grand Hustle king y'all know what I'm about bitch

[Chorus]
