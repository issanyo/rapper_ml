[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah, this is how you run it
Had a bunch of choices, I'm the one you wanted
You was better off without me, but you still felt punished
Even when we broke up, she kept it 100, she kept it 100

[Chorus]
She kept it one oh oh, oh oh, oh oh
She kept it one oh oh, oh oh, oh oh
She kept it one oh oh, oh oh, oh oh
She kept it one, she kept it one

[Verse 1]
Yeah, I wasn't perfect at all, but you picked up for my calls
You textin', you ask if I eat right
All alone without me you don't sleep right
Tossin' and turnin', your incense is burnin'
A lot of learnin' about each other now
We were best friends before we was lovers
So how could we bring each other down
I gotta be out, you need to breathe now, 'cause
We ain't on the same page, no
Ain't slept together in days, and
The hugs and the kisses turn to waves
The love that we had turn to paint
And you still hold it down 'cause you feel it
100 forever like really though, really

[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah, this is how you run it
Had a bunch of choices, I'm the one you wanted
You was better off without me, but you still felt punished
Even when we broke up, she kept it 100, she kept it 100

[Chorus]
She kept it one oh oh, oh oh, oh oh
She kept it one oh oh, oh oh, oh oh
She kept it one oh oh, oh oh, oh oh
She kept it one, she kept it one

[Verse 2]
A whole lotta understanding for sure
My time ain't demanding no more
You tryna figure out the best play
To be there for me in the best way
I'm tryna save you from the heartache
I just wanna smile like we used to
And maybe we can come back in the future
And find what we lost in the move and I mean that
Truly, I know what can happen when
You break the heart of a woman
The moment you capture it
And everything used to be passionate
Now it all feels like a accident
All of the years of imagining
All of the happenings
Maybe we rushing
But I knew I could trust you to keep it 100, 100

[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah, this is how you run it
Had a bunch of choices, I'm the one you wanted
You was better off without me, but you still felt punished
Even when we broke up, she kept it 100, she kept it 100

[Chorus]
She kept it one oh oh, oh oh, oh oh
She kept it one oh oh, oh oh, oh oh
She kept it one oh oh, oh oh, oh oh
She kept it one, she kept it one

[Outro]
That day
And I almost just lost a good thing (That day)
And I almost just lost a good thing (That day)
And I almost just lost a good thing (That day)
Turn the lights off
