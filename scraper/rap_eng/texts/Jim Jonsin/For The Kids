[Verse 1]
Give me joy, give me violence
Give me noise, give me silence
Hear my voice, feel my torment
But don't rejoice, when I lay dormant
America, told me what I should feel
And there it was to my surprise I learned that nothing's real
And those clouds only come out when it rains
So don't get too comfortable, just stand there and take even if you gotta fake it

[Hook]
They told me to stay for the kids, so I did
They say love’s only meant for the happy ones
So why do I feel like this?
Don’t call a quits, stay for the kids
But what we gonna do when they grow up
Stay for the kids
But what we gonna do when they grow up
Turn the lights on

[Verse 2]
She say she love a nigga, she say she love a nigga
But if you fuck up, she gon' go and fuck another nigga
You wanna hate her, but you feel too deep in love with her
Now you got kids by it, and you know bloods thicker
No longer doing things that we once did
Eyes rolling, attitude over dumb shit
Direct deposit, you be smiling when the funds hit
For a second, then you bringing up that one bitch
Yeah I hit it, I’ll admit it
Yeah, yeah I did it, when I shoulda been committed
The gloved fitted, so I would not be acquitted
Sentenced to death to us apart, who's fault is it?
And those clouds only come out when it rains
I just hope I get a couple of visits
So don't get too comfortable
Just stand there and take even if you gotta fake it

[Hook]
