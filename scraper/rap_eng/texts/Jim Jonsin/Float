[Refrain]
Yeah they trickin’ if you got it, hoe
Yeah they trickin’ if you got it, hoe
Give it to her if she want it, hoe
If she give it to you, how you want it, hoe?

[Verse 1]
I came from nothing, when I get it I be stuntin’
Spent it like I meant it, every dollar keeps it jumpin’
Easy come, easy go
Ones, it’s like guns, you just dump and reload
Bands make her dance to get that ass on the pole, (hoe)
And show me what it look like
This ‘gon be a good night
The real party starts with most niggas saying goodnight
Fat asses, small waists, tattoos, pretty faces. My taste is, for bad bitches
That’s opinionated
That’s in the entertaining, but an end to entertainment
And there’s no need for you to leave with who you came with
My hands do the talking and your body speaks my language

[Hook]
First you break it down then you show me where it’s at
Make it touch the ground then you came and brang it back
You could give a square nigga fucking all the tack
Damn baby you stack, that’s why you get them racks

This ‘bout to be the realest shit I ever wrote
This ‘bout to be the best kush that I ever smoked
You ‘bout to be the baddest bitch I ever stroked
Throw this money in the air, you could watch it float, down

Yeah, watch it float, down
Look up and watch it float, down
Girl, watch it float, down
Do it like it’s all you know

[Verse 2]
She ain’t strippin’ for tuition, money is the mission
She got a lust for living, wants the condos and the Benz’s
From daddy’s little princess to queen of the bad bitches
The red bottle specialist, your sexiness is effortless
And it’s worth it to spend it ‘cause you deserve it, hoe
Roll one up, blaze up and watch you twerk it, hoe
Booty so round make a square nigga nervous
Spent the last six months in the gym putting work in
And in shows you look good, yeah, you know
But it’s still nice to hear it that it game I’m in your ear with
After the club I be in the car waiting for ya
Back to the hotel to throw a couple car payments on ya

[Hook]
First you break it down then you show me where it’s at
Make it touch the ground then you came and brang it back
You could give a square nigga fucking all the tack
Damn baby you stack, that’s why you get them racks

This ‘bout to be the realest shit I ever wrote
This ‘bout to be the best kush that I ever smoked
You ‘bout to be the baddest bitch I ever stroked
Throw this money in the air, you could watch it float, down

Yeah, watch it float, down
Look up and watch it float, down
Girl, watch it float, down
Do it like it’s all you know

[Refrain]
Yeah they trickin’ if you got it, hoe
Yeah they trickin’ if you got it, hoe
Give it to her if she want it, hoe
If she give it to you, how you want it, hoe?
