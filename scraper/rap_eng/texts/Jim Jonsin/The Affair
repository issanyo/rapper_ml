[Verse 1]
Funny how strangers, can turn into way more
I'm waking up late night, calling ya name
First time that I saw you, I wanted to say more
I was speechless, but when you left I had so much to say
Our time has come to bid farewell
Let's hold on to these moments, for how long, time only tells

[Pre-Hook]
Wondering where will you be this time next year
Hoping it will be with me right here

[Hook]
I love you like, summertime, summer nights, summer days
It's breaking this heart of mine, whenever you go away
I love you like, summertime, summer nights, summer days
It's breaking this heart of mine, whenever you go away

[Verse 2]
Beach house in the Hamptons, the month of July
On the patio, bumping Mumford & Sons getting high
We got slightly acquainted
She unfamiliar with entertainers that's awesome ain't it?
Felt so far from famous, I felt more courageous
Them other brauds I dated, made me think all brauds were jaded, trippy right?
Is this a summer fling, or an every summer thing
Some many places she can be, why she up under me
Start to panic when I think about our separation
Its so romantic, but I think we got sleep deprivation
I learned your body, and I'm grateful for my education
Graduated straight A's, Damn this was the best vacation

[Pre-Hook]
Wondering where will you be this time next year
Turn the lights on, hoping it will be with me right here

[Hook]
