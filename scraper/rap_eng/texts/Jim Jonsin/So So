[Verse 1]
Yes sir is Bobby Ray, aka A. B.o.B. (O)
I can't be eco-conscious, I'm always burning trees
And this that fire, fire, call it that third degree
And call me supersonic I shake the earth beneath ya
Hell yeah you heard of me, quite an emergency
The way I take the game and I beat it so un-unmercifully, yeah
Ladies with curly features, wait at concerts to see you
They can roll home with B.O., and maybe service me up
But if you wanna work for me then girl you need your working visas
And if you ain't working then you just should not converse with me
That's not that serious, don't take it so personally
Plus currently I prefer the girls who prefer the three C.P.O
C.P.O. I think I think I'm Neo
I'm caught up in her Matrix and I think it's time to reload
And if this were a court, then girl I would have to appeal
I think that the defendant have some things that she must reveal
Heels ha, heels ha, tell me what's the deal, ma
Got me chasing you to see if I could cop a feel, huh
I gotta keep it real, kosher, kosher, kosher
Cause she don't want that bullshit, no sir, no sir, no sir
Her thighs go round like roller-coaster motors
And like a minute bundle, I had to roll them over
Had to connect the headset into her Motorolla
This bout to get scary like the end of October

[Hook]
And this is about the time when I hit you with the dope flow
I got that fire man, and other shit is so so
And this is about the time when I hit you with the dope flow
I'm at the frying pan, your shit is so cold
And this is about the time when I hit you with the dope flow
I got that fire man, and other shit is so so
And this is about the time when I hit you with the dope flow
I'm at the frying pan, your shit is so cold

[Verse 2]
So cold like a hobo wearing no clothes in a snow globe when the temperature is below froze
I mean below freezing and there's no reason to be so cheesy, got my own team and my own league
My own lane and my own speed, it's a long road so I don't sleep
If I don't know you I don't speak, it's a small world and it's gonna shrink
If you're full of shit, then you're gonna stink
I'm a realist I'm gonna think, with a pair of eyes so I'm gonna see
I'll be whatever the fuck I wanna be, I'll be everything except a wanna be
I'll be everything you ever wanna be, if you're clever enough you can corner me
But what's a corner to me, I'm geometry
So tell me who gave you the authority? Who the fuck are you? The authority?
What am I supposed to be orderly? pardon my honor you're charging me?
Saying something I oughta be but I got some much heart that my arteries will always be partying like a camaraderie
Man I'm already famous historically so my story is already glorious
Just like P Diddy victorious to the B.I.G. Notorius
I'm a champion, I'm a warrior, I bring war to ya
So if you got beef that's unfortunate, we'll hang ya'll out like portraits

[Hook]
And this is about the time when I hit you with the dope flow

I'm at the frying pan, your shit is so cold
And this is about the time when I hit you with the dope flow
I got that fire man, and other shit is so so
And this is about the time when I hit you with the dope flow
I'm at the frying pan, your shit is so cold
