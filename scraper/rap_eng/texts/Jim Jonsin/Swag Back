My head is clear, I'm so survivin'
'Cause you're not here but I'm not cryin', no

I finally got my swag back
So I don't need that broken heart no more
You can have that
'Cause baby, I got my swag back, yeah

My head is clear, I'm so survivin'
'Cause you're not here but I'm not cryin', no
I finally got my swag back

Too many years I spent here
Puttin' up with you, with you, oh
Now baby, I'm feelin' like I heard so many of your lies
I don't know what's true, so I gotta move on

Now you been runnin' that game for too long
(Thinkin' 'bout all the time I wasted)
And I sat back and let you do wrong, oh

My head is clear, I'm so survivin'
'Cause you're not here but I'm not cryin', no

I finally got my swag back
So I don't need that broken heart no more
You can have that
'Cause baby, I got my swag back, yeah

My head is clear, I'm so survivin'
'Cause you're not here but I'm not cryin', no
I finally got my swag back

I can't believe I let myself fall hard for you
'Cause I'm way too fly to be played like a fool
But in life you learn what and what not to do, yeah
I got me a new bag and some walkin' shoes

Now you been runnin' that game for too long
(Thinkin' 'bout all that time I wasted)
And I sat back and let you do wrong, oh

My head is clear, I'm so survivin'
'Cause you're not here but I'm not cryin', no

I finally got my swag back
So I don't need that broken heart no more
You can have that
'Cause baby, I got my swag back, yeah

My head is clear, I'm so survivin'
'Cause you're not here but I'm not cryin', no
I finally got my swag back

I walked out and I won't come back this time
'Cause baby, I'm just doin' fine, yeah

So you can take [Incomprehensible]
'Cause I moved on, I don't care what you doin', oh, oh
Baby, that broken heart don't fit me no more

My head is clear, I'm so survivin'
'Cause you're not here but I'm not cryin', no

I finally got my swag back
So I don't need that broken heart no more
You can have that
