[Intro]
Haha, you ready?
Come on, I'm ready
Wha' you say, different?
D-D-D-D&H remix
Alright...

[Verse 1]
Put your hands pon the wall and make me search you like a cop
If you resist, your rump a get a slap
Hands behind your back, limit your mobility
Then me choke you like police brutality
Pull your hair then whisper inna your ear
Soft but clear so everything you hear
You say, "Baby, please can you put it in there!"
Mi say, "No, me ago tease you 'til you beg me fi relieve you"
Or, Chapter 2 inna the movie, Second Act
Pretend like say you're sick and a mi a the doc'
What are the symptoms? No fret 'cause me have it lock
Now take this to the nurse, then come back fi your shot
Or, sit down inna mi lap! Me a the boss, you a the worker
Pop off da blouse yah. Wait! Tear off da skirt yah
Wha' you call that? Performers motivation
Or is it just plane ol' office molestation
That's the meditation when you inna a relationship
And you no waan it sink down inna the ocean
Sometimes fi please your woman you haffi change the station
And tune into a different type of program

[Chorus]
The gyal dem say dem tired of the boring man dem
So, fi hold dem, you haffi put it pon dem
Grab dem and give it to dem different
You haffi know fi give it to dem different
You give it to her hard and long, feel say you a the man
Bring the money come and then she still a give you bun
'Cause you no give it to her different
You haffi know fi give it to her different

[Verse 2]
She said she's tired of the bedroom, the bedroom, the bedroom Yeah
She no waan fi see no living room, no living room
It feel like a tomb, yeah
She waan fi go pon the veranda, the veranda
Wake the neighbors, yeah
So me give her inna the driveway, she nah play, inna broad day Yeah, yeah
She's tired of the kissing up and feeling up of titty
Backas pon the rooftop, overlook the city
Or, lunch time, link her up and buss a quickie
Or, even inna the traffic, inna the middle of the city, hey
She waan fi boost up her adrenaline
The Kama Sutra, change up the positions weh you have her in
But anuh all the time a daggering
Sometimes you whine up inna her, 'til she begs you fi the hammering
Book a flight ticket for 2 to Miami
All when you nuh have nothing fi go do inna Miami
'Cause she waan fuck when the plane a fly off
And by the time the plane a take off, people think say we a get off
Rudeboy, try da one yah with the girls dem weh give head
Empty out your gun, but lef' one inna the head
When she a do her ting, just rest it pon her head
And when you feel like you ago cum, buss it!, pray say she no dead

[Interlude]
No, no bother do da one yah
(Try it nuh) Don't do that one
But you get the picture, right?
You get the picture, yeah

[Chorus]
The gyal dem say dem tired of the boring man dem
So, fi hold dem, you haffi put it pon dem
Grab dem and give it to dem different
You haffi know fi give it to dem different
You give it to her hard and long, feel say you a the man
Bring the money come and then she still a give you bun
'Cause you no give it to her different
You haffi know fi give it to her different

[Outro]
She said she's tired of the bedroom, the bedroom, the bedroom Yeah
She no waan fi see no living room, no living room
It feel like a tomb, yeah
She waan fi go pon the veranda, the veranda
Wake the neighbors, yeah
So me give her inna the driveway, she nah play, inna broad day Yeah, yeah
