[talking: Jon B]
I've been waiting so long
I've been waiting so long girl
I've been waiting so long
I've been waiting so long girl
So long
So long girl
I've been waiting too long

[Verse 1:]
Shining through the darkness you turn my night to day (you turn my night to day)
You light me like a lighter and make my fire blaze (and make my fire blaze)

[Hook:]
Every little thing we do is just to prove to you how special you are how special you are
This is to show and prove to you, you know what you do, you know who you are
Girl yous a star

[Chorus: x2]
Girl it's you
It's you
It's you
It's you
Girl it's you
It's you
It's you

[Verse 2:]
Keep aware myself alarm reserve my special place (reserve my special place)
To let me get to love you fill out that empty space
Oooo yeah

[Hook]

[Chorus x2]

[Bridge: x2]
Shine your light on me baby
Shine it bright
Shine it through the day and shine it through the night

[Chorus x4]
