Verse 1:
Easy my love come, easy she go, heating my blood, then leaving me cold, easy she come, easy she go, I'm falling apart but i can't get enough. Easy my love come and easy she go, someone to touch but never to hold, where did you come from and where did you go, got a piece of my heart and your pick of them all

Bridge:
Oh the way you pull me deeper in
The subtle taste of your skin, woah, got me feeling like the first time

Chorus:
Get down like you know what you're doing
Red now got me trippin' on you
So high but I know you're gonna' let me fall. (Don’t meltdown)
Meltdown girl you're moving like fluid
Red now I'mma' sink into you
Yeah ma, so fine I wanna' melt right into you

Verse 2:
Easy my love come, easy she go, selling me Sunday like false hope
Easy she come, easy she go
I'm dead in the water and begging for more. Easy my love come and easy she go, someone to touch but never to hold
Where did you come from and where did
You go, I'm gonna' follow forever I know

Bridge:
Oh the way you pull me deeper in
While you cover every inch, whoa, got me feeling like the first time

Chorus:

Get down like you know what you're doing
Red now got me trippin' on you
So high but I know you're gonna' let me fall. (Don’t meltdown)
Meltdown girl you're moving like fluid
Red now I'mma' sink into you
Yeah ma, so fine I wanna' melt right into you

(Instrumental)

Easy my love come, easy she go. (Echo)
Easy my love come, easy she go. (Echo)

Reprise:
Easy my love come, and easy she go
Someone to touch but never to hold
Easy she come, easy she go
I'm dead in the water, and begging for more. Easy my love come, and easy she go, selling me Sunday like false hope
Easy she come, easy she go, Easy my love come and easy she go

Chorus:
Get down like you know what you're doing
Red now got me trippin' on you
So high but I know you're gonna' let me fall. (Don’t meltdown)
Meltdown girl you're moving like fluid
Red now I'mma' sink into you
Yeah ma, so fine I wanna' melt right into you
