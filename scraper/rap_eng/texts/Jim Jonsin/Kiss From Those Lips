[Intro: Qwote]
Yo Jim, how can I say this without saying it?
It's your boy Qwote, and Mr. World Wide

[Hook: Qwote]
I was wondering, if you don't mind
Can I get a kiss from those lips, kiss from those lips
Kiss from those lips, kiss from those lips
Can I, can I, can I, can I, can I, can I
Can I, can I, can I, can I, can I, can I
Get a kiss from those lips, kiss from those lips
Kiss from those lips

[Verse 1: Qwote]
I had an epiphany in my Cadillac
Just the thought of it make my fucking eyes roll back
That's hard to look with them pretty red lips
And the way your soft hands will feel around my (ooooh)
I know you get the picture now of what I'm saying
You on your knees, I ain't talking about praying
I'm all one soul you know I'm feeling right
Little mama gimme a sip of what I would like
Girl I'm motivated and ready from that pone
And the way your jeans are hugging, driving me crazy
So let's take it back to my hotel, hotel
Pop a bottle, get low and blow it like you do

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Pitbull]
The way you talk dirty, yeah I like that
The way you bring other girls, yeah I like that
The way you rock them heels, yeah I like that
No thong up under that skirt, oooh I like that
And baby you could get freaky, yeah that's cool
You could get loose, yeah that's cool
You could have a drink, yeah that's cool
Put you up on the bar, yeah that's cool
The way you shake your ass, I'm like ooh
I don't mean to be rude
But I swear to God
There's so many things I'd love to do to you
We can take it back to the crib
I show you how I live
And I can give you, yeah, the biz
And you can show me what it is
I wanna see cause I give
Let my tongue be the bridge
Just imagine how that is

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Qwote]
Heard you were a sucker, mama, for lollipops
Well if that's the truth then come to my candy shop
Got that chocolate factory open whenever
Let me introduce you to Mr. Willie Wonka
I can tell you know exactly what I'm talking about
If I go where you're licking your lips, staring down south
Finish up your drink and let's head out
Got a feeling you'll blow my brains out
I'm motivated and ready from that pone
And the way your jeans are hugging, driving me crazy
So let's take it back to my hotel, hotel
Pop a bottle, get low and blow it like you do

[Hook]
