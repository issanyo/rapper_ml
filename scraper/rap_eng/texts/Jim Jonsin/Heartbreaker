See me on the T.V
You're trying to jump in your set
You got a load of me
And now you have that wet (so wet)
But you wish that I told you that you was next
I'll ring the bells
I'll make you sweat
You'll lose you breath

If you had a girl like me could you handle, all this lovin'
I could make you work for free, I ain't lying (it ain't nothing)
I'm a hazard to your health
So take caution, I swear
You couldn't take it even if you're prepared

I'm just trying to warn you
I'm a heartbreaker
Even if I push up on ya
I'm a heartbreaker
Even if you get my number
I'm a heartbreaker
Don't even try to start
'Cause I will break your heart
I'm a heartbreaker

You buy them magazines
Just to read the words I say
You're hanging where I hang
Just to get a glimpse of (me)
I bet you convinced I'm yours
But it ain't quite what you think

Boys go down you roll
Pump on your brakes
Pull down you brace
OK, OK, OK

If you had a girl like me, you'd be acting up (dumb crazy)
I'ma save you from yourself 'cause I know you, can't take me
If you think you could be mine, you bugging
I swear, you couldn't take it even if you were here

I'm just trying to warn you
I'm a heartbreaker
Even if I push up on ya
I'm a heartbreaker
Even if you get my number
I'm a heartbreaker
Don't even try to start
Cause I will break your heart

2, 3, Break!

Don't stop, don't stop
Don't stop, don't stop
Don't stop, don't stop
Don't stop, don't stop
Don't stop, don't stop
Don't stop, don't stop
Don't stop, don't stop
Don't stop, don't stop

Think about it
Before you try me
'Cause if you got it
You wouldn't know what to do with me
Think about it
Before you try me
'Cause if you got it
You wouldn't know what to do with me

I'm just trying to warn you
I'm a heartbreaker
Even if I push up on ya
I'm a heartbreaker
Even if you get my number
I'm a heartbreaker
Don't even try to start
Cause I will break your heart
I'm a heartbreaker
