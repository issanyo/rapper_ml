[Nelly]
So they sayyyyy, she's a bad girl
Some say she's a bitch, she's a liar
And fucking with her is like playing with fire
And so I'll sayyyyy (so I'll say) hey that's my girl (that's my girl)
And I'mma be the one that's gonna make her better
And you gonna' always see the two of us together (yeah)
Cause when I'm goin through some things, I
Know that she's my day, light
In the middle of the darkness I can see things clearly
Because she's near me, yeahhhhhh

[Hook: Nelly]
Ain't no way I'm letting her go
See I've been warned by everyone around me
She gonna' be the death of me, oh yeah
But ain't no way I'm letting her go, noooo
See all the money in this world
Mean nothing without her, nothing without her, yeahhhh

[Nelly]
So they sayyyyy, she's a problem
It ain't nothing cause I'm known to be a solver
And I ain't worried 'bout what other people call her
So I'll sayyyyy (so I'll say) I tamed a wild one (I tamed a wild one)
I ain't saying I can make nobody perfect
But I can really see what's underneath the surface (yeah)
Cause when I look deep in her eyes, I
See there's love inside, I
Wanna be the one to show her, that I'm truly devoted
She's gonna know it, yeahhh so

[Nelly - repeat 2X]
Let me be the reason baby let me be the cause
Let me be the only one you let up in your heart
Let me be the picture, that's sitting in your frame
Let me be your lover, I'll let you be the same
