[Sam:]
I was thinking about you
Thinking about me
Thinking about us
What we gonna be
Open my eyes
[Sam and Christina:]
It was only just a dream

[Christina:]
Travel back down that road
Will you come back?
No one knows
I realize
[Christina and Sam:]
It was only just a dream

[Sam:]
I was at the top
And now it's like I'm in a basement
Number one spot
Now you find you a replacement
I swear now that I can't take it
Knowing somebody's got my baby

Now you ain't around
Baby I can't think
I shoulda put it down
Shoulda got that ring
'Cause I can still feel it in the air
See your pretty face
Run my fingers through your hair

My lover, my life
My baby, my wife
You left me, I'm tied
'Cause I know that it just ain't right

[Sam and Christina:]
I was thinking about you
Thinking about me
Thinking about us
What we gonna be
Open my eyes
It was only just a dream

So I travel back down that road
Will you come back?
No one knows
I realize, it was only just a dream

[Christina:]
Riding I swear
I see your face at every turn
I'm trying to get my usher on
But I can't let it burn
And I just hope you know that you're the only one I yearn for
No wonder I'll be missing when I learn

Didn't give you all my love
I guess now I got my payback
Now I'm in the club
Thinking all about you baby
Hey you were so easy to love
But wait, I guess our love wasn't enough

I'm going through it every time that I'm alone
And now I'm wishing that you'd pick up the phone
But you made a decision that you wanted to move on
'Cause I was wrong

[Sam and Christina:]
I was thinking about you
Thinking about me
Thinking about us
What we gonna be
Open my eyes
It was only just a dream

So I travel back down that road
Will you come back?
No one knows
I realize, it was only just a dream

If you ever loved somebody put your hands up
If you ever loved somebody put your hands up
And now they're gone and you're wishing you could give them everything

[Christina:] If you ever loved somebody put your hands up
[Sam:] If you ever loved somebody put your hands up
[Christina:] If you ever loved somebody put your hands up
[Sam:] If you ever loved somebody put your hands up
[Sam and Christina:]
And now they're gone and you're wishing you could give them everything

[Sam and Christina:]
I was thinking about you

Thinking about us
What we gonna be

It was only just a dream ([Sam:] It's just a dream)

So I travel back down that road ([Christina:] Travel back, [Sam:] Travel back)
Will you come back? ([Christina:] Down the road, [Sam:] Down the road)
No one knows ([Sam:] No one knows)
I realize, it was only just a dream ([Sam:] No, no, no, no)

I was thinking about you ([Christina:] Woo)
Thinking about me
Thinking about us ([Sam:] Woo)
What we gonna be ([Sam:] Yeah)
Open my eyes... ([Christina:] Open my eyes, [Sam:] Open my eyes)
It was only just a dream ([Christina:] just a dream)

It was only just a dream

[Sam and Christina:]
No, oh
It was only just a dream
