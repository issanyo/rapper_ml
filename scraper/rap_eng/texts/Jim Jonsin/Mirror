[Intro]
Mirror, mirror
Oh, oh
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
From the second I laid eyes on you
In the mirror, in that dressing room
Seeing you with me, I finally knew
The picture was complete
I used to have my share of lonely days
Beneath the makeup and the darkest shades
But ever since you came I know
The meaning of true love again

[Pre-Chorus]
It's not the bags or the trips or the clothes
It's not the fans or the sold-out shows
It's the way that you see through my soul
I'm so exposed

[Chorus]
When I look at myself in the mirror
I don't have to feel ashamed
Now it couldn't be much clearer
I'll never have to search again
When I look at myself in the mirror
I don't even recognize the girl
'Cause now I sit by my side
When I look at myself in the mirror

[Verse 2]
No, nothing's ever gonna be the same
Forget the fortune, you can keep the fame
Maybe if I had to choose, you know
I'd trade it every time for you
'Cause this reflection that I'm staring at
Is so amazing I can't turn my back
And every time I look at you and me together
Boy, I know the truth, oh

[Pre-Chorus]
It's not the bags or the trips or the clothes
It's not the fans or the sold-out shows
It's the way that you see through my soul
I'm so exposed

[Chorus]
When I look at myself in the mirror
I don't have to feel ashamed
Now it couldn't be much clearer
I'll never have to search again
When I look at myself in the mirror
I don't even recognize the girl
'Cause now I sit by my side
When I look at myself in the mirror

[Bridge]
I can't help it, I can't help it
I can't help it, I can't help it
Now she's running from love, that's all I'm guilty of
And I don't have to search no more
Found what I'm looking for in the mirror, in the mirror

[Chorus]
When I look at myself in the mirror
I don't have to feel ashamed
Now it couldn't be much clearer
I'll never have to search again
When I look at myself in the mirror
I don't even recognize the girl
'Cause now I sit by my side
When I look at myself

[Outro]
Baby, I see you, baby, I see me
Hope that we could be forever
In the mirror, in the mirror
Baby, I see you, baby, I see me
Hope that we could be forever
In the mirror, in the mirror
