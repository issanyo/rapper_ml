Something different...

[Verse 1]
Life ain't 'bout mistakes and bad decisions
So I slowed down instead, just keep on living
A sip and a double-cup sure gives me double vision
Add a little bit of liquor, my nigga, I'm fucking twisted
Yeah, uh
But I still know where I'm headed
Girl, follow me, we're in the right direction
If they're talking shit, just let 'em
Way up here, it's so easy to forget 'em

[Hook]
Come get away with me
Life is just a game so we play for keeps
You and this money, that's all I see
That's all I need

So come meet me on the runway
I got two tickets one way
Let's fly away
Let's fly away

Come meet me on the runway
I got two tickets one way
Let's fly away
Just you and me
Yeah, yeah

[Verse 2]
Second chances are made for two
Let's just focus on us, we ain't really got shit to prove
Uh
You remember taking shots on top of the roof
Then we'd sneak in and fuck all night in your old dorm room
Yeah, uh
But now I know where I'm headed
Got these tattoos and I don't regret 'em
Some people need time to learn their lesson
But since I seen you I ain't had no questions

[Hook]
Come get away with me
Life is just a game so we play for keeps
You and this money, that's all I see
That's all I need

So come meet me on the runway
I got two tickets one way
Let's fly away
Let's fly away

Come meet me on the runway
I got two tickets one way
Let's fly away
Just you and me
Yeah, yeah

[Verse 3]
Why wait another minute? We could be out
So sure what these other people seek out
That ain't something that I'm even trying to worry 'bout
Pack your bags, I'll send a cab to get you at your house
And we 'gon burn good and have good conversation
I will cut my phone off 'cause we on vacation
And I'ma turn it to a lifetime
Rings on her finger, on a beat, sipping white wine

[Hook]
Come get away with me
Life is just a game so we play for keeps
You and this money, that's all I see
That's all I need

So come meet me on the runway
I got two tickets one way
Let's fly away
Let's fly away

Come meet me on the runway
I got two tickets one way
Let's fly away
Just you and me
Yeah, yeah
