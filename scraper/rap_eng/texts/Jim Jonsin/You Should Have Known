[Verse 1]
Black Silverado, 45' on my lap, I’ma loaded gun
I’m from Alabama, that’s just how I was raised
Tattoos, whiskey bottle, pocket full of money, I’m a lot of fun
Give you something to remember, then baby I’m on my way
Fast women, fast cars
Low life, rockstars

[Bridge]
Riding in the Chevy with the men like me
We’ll leave you with a broken heart
I’m a ramblin' man, I’m a son of a bitch from the start

[Hook]
Baby you should have known
You should have known
Baby you should have known
You should have known
Baby you should have known
You should have known
Baby you should have known
Bitch, you should have known

[Verse 2]
I’m a mistfit darling, let’s be real
I don’t mean to gas you up
That cheap perfume is kinda like a 'shroom
Wanna take a trip in the passenger?
Smoke that, what’d you got? half a blunt
High yourself, laugh it up
Drink a little bit of that Jack in the cup
Then we jump in the back and fuck
Wanna grab a hold of my leather jacket?
Take another photo with me and tag it?
Ohh you all about Instagram; instant fame and sex is passion
Me too, let me take my shades off, get a peak at you
What’s your name? I forgot
Nevermind I don’t really need not to
No, better off really ‘cause I just seen you wack a show (Slum bunny)
Little bit of fenus for that penis in the dough, huh
Big ol' truck, black on black, think you wanna go pack a backpack
Think you wanna turn around with that fat ass
Catfish Billy you’re looking back at (bump it)
808 underneath that seat, get that pussy humming
Now you’re drunk, stoned and fuck
Crooked smile like a light superwoman, well
It’s about time I go, don’t wanna be hate, but meaning cold
But I got a 6 am flight, baby bye bye, I got to hit the road
I’m..

Riding in the Chevy with the men like me

Baby you should have known
You should have known
Baby you should have known
Bitch, you should have known
Baby you should have known
You should have known
Baby you should have known
Bitch, you should have known
