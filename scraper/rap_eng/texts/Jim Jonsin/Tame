Jim Jones
Prima J, ay ay
Let's go

I told him I like you with your clothes on
But they gotta go
So you better have 'em off
When I come back

And I said yes, I gotta boyfriend
But he's out of town
Baby, he ain't coming home
So you can relax

Don't need no Hennessey, Tequila
Or a couple Margueritas
'Cause I'm tipsy naturally
Damn it's so unfair

You were fixated on my navel
When I got up on the table
Pulling secrets out my purse
Always so prepared, he said

You're not an emotional kind of girl
You know what you want and I'm a give it to you
A very unapproachable kind of girl
I got what you need and I'm a give it to you

This weak, I've never seen her before
She's like, she's like an animal
She walked in and threw her clothes on the floor
I think she's highly flammable

S-s-she's so hard to tame
T-t-tame
S-s-she's so hard to tame
T-t-tame

S-s-she's so hard to tame
T-t-tame
S-s-she's so hard to tame
She's like, she's like an animal

I said I'm ready for some round three
Yeah, wrap my legs around him
And this time
I want you to pull my hair

Booty bouncing up and down
And I took it to the ground
He was lovin' it
But then we almost broke that chair

As the walls started rocking
The whole club behind us watching
Getting crazy almost made them
Wanna close their eyes

It was time I made it clear
So I whispered in his ear
I said brace yourself
I'm about to blow your mind, he said

You're not an emotional kind of girl
You know what you want and I'm a give it to you
A very unapproachable kind of girl
I got what you need and I'm a give it to you

This weak, I've never seen her before
She's like, she's like an animal
She walked in and threw her clothes on the floor
I think she's highly flammable

S-s-she's so hard to tame
T-t-tame
S-s-she's so hard to tame
T-t-tame

S-s-she's so hard to tame
T-t-tame
S-s-she's so hard to tame
She's like, she's like an animal

I'm a bad girl that can handle that
I put it down so crazy Maniac
Your toes curl up and your eyes roll back
Ain't nobody ever put it on you like that

I bangs real hard like Jone's tracks
Don't catch feelings, don't call back
They wanna come and claim the cat
But ain't nobody taming that

So you can put away ya leash
I'm beast get it, get it
Hey, these suckers love sick
'Cause I'm so sick with it

And if you ain't know
Then you know now
This is how it's going down
Can't nobody hold me down

S-s-she's so hard to tame
This weak, I've never seen her before
She's like, she's like an animal
She walked in and threw her clothes on the floor
I think she's highly flammable

S-s-she's so hard to tame
T-t-tame
S-s-she's so hard to tame
T-t-tame

S-s-she's so hard to tame
T-t-tame
S-s-she's so hard to tame
She's like, she's like an animal
