I see everybody around
But it feels like we're in private
I know you want me so bad
'Cause you just can't seem to hide it
The lights are moving to the rhythm of the music
When we're together everything just comes together, baby
So inspired by the moment, we can lose it
I hope you're ready
As long as I see the strobe lights
I'm dancin' all night long
When we're together, baby, I'm feelin' alright
You got me all night long
So tell the DJ play it
(All night, all night, all night, all night)
All night long, all night long
(All night, night, night, night)
So tell the DJ play it
(All night, all night, all night, all night)
All night long, all night long
(All night, night, night, night)
So tell the DJ play it
Tonight, the admission is free
Now we're shuttin' the club down
We're moving out to the streets
All we got left is love now
Feel my troubles fade into the rhythm of your heartbeat
When we're together, everything just comes together, baby
Every motion calls your name, baby, once you saw me
And I hope you're ready
As long as I see the strobe lights
I'm dancin' all night long
When we're together, baby, I'm feelin' alright
You got me all night long
So tell the DJ play it
(All night, all night, all night, all night)
All night long, all night long
(All night, night, night, night)
So tell the DJ play it
(All night, all night, all night, all night)
All night long, all night long
(All night, night, night, night)
So tell the DJ play it
And you made me forget all my worries
Helped me put the past behind
Around us this world's in a hurry
While we stand still in time
The lights are moving to the rhythm of the music
When we're together everything just comes together, baby
So inspired by the moment, we can lose it
And I hope you're ready
As long as I see the strobe lights
I'm dancin' all night long
When we're together, baby, I'm feelin' alright
You got me all night long
So tell the DJ play it
(All night, all night, all night, all night)
All night long, all night long
(All night, night, night, night)
So tell the DJ play it
(All night, all night, all night, all night)
All night long, all night long
(All night, night, night, night)
So tell the DJ play it
It's only you and me together
And this feeling's so strong
Wish I could stay like this forever
All night long
(All night, all night, all night, all night)
All night long
(All night, night, night, night)
Said, all night long
(All night, all night, all night, all night)
Yeah
(All night, night, night, night)
