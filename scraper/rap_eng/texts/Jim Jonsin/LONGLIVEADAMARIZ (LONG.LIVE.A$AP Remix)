Verse 1]
I thought I'd probably have arisen , expensive taste in what isn’t
Ain't had no man to sin with, now my kitchen full of dishes
Nose runny from that sniffin', your cell phone addiction
Trigger finger itching without parental supervision
This be that murder business, little Timmy got that demi
I ain't kidding hide yo kittens, hide yo children, give em vision
A bunch of ignant little piglets, hard headed, never listen
Purple sippin', finger twistin', teeth glisten like it's Memphis
A bunch of hypocritic rich and, the land of the imprissoned
My Santa Claus was missing, catch you slippin' then it's Christmas
Who really needs a wishlist, my ghetto was ambition
For my benjis and my Bentley, and them gentry, now I gets gets
On the road to riches, a diamond ring, designer jeans
Choking on that biscuit till I'm no longer existing
I wonder if they miss me, as long as I make history
Now my soul is feeling empty, tell Jesus to come and get me

[Hook]
Who said you can’t live forever lied
Of course, I’m living forever I’ll
Forever, I’ll live long
You can’t ever deny
My force, I’m living forever I’ll
Forever, I’ll LIVE

[Verse 2]
Riding through your city like yo city is mine
Maybe i could win an emmy, by doing acting on the side
License plate says write me down, car from 1989
But it took a little lying, pretty lies, it’s looking fine
You Lost your mind, what's on your mind don’t look down
Never talk to cops, i respect them lots, they just roam the block, but the block ain’t hot
Tell 'em watch your spine, I mean watch your back
Better guide your track, better not look back
Now stay in line, don't step on cracks
You might break your back I'm screaming “please stay calm”
Cause there's killers in my town, making hits, sniffing lines
Out committing crimes, wait for them to simmer down
Corrupted little minds, work 5 to 9, finna shine
On the grind, do you dirty with that shimmy shimmy ya
Where they hate without a purpose, services 'n hearses
Kids who ain't deserve it, can't survive a thing, think they’re worthless
Strangers make me nervous, who's that peekin' in my window tryna hide behind the curtains?

[Hook]
Who said you can’t live forever lied
Of course, I’m living forever I’ll
Forever, I’ll live long
You can’t ever deny
My force, I’m living forever I’ll
Forever, I’ll LIVE

[Bridge]
Pretty ain’t a glitch , Flacka macking hits
And that girl, know we poppin' so she boppin' on this pitch
Oh, R.I.P. to Pimp, can't forget Little Flip
And I take it out to Texas, & shout out to hypocrites

[Hook]
Who said you can’t live forever lied
Of course, I’m living forever I’ll
Forever, I’ll live long
You can’t ever deny
My force, I’m living forever I’ll
Forever, I’ll LIVE
