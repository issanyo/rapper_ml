Ohh... oh, oh oh (repeat)

[Verse 1:]
Thought I was standing tall
I thought I seen it all
But baby I was wrong
'Cause you're the greatest
I walk a thousand miles
But nothing's what I found
Until you came around
'Cause you're the greatest

Search high and low for love, just
To find out, that it was here all along, and
I know it, but I wanted it
I should've been chasing you

[Chorus:]
And I was reaching for the stars
Didn't have to look so far
'Cause love's where you are
But I didn't have a clue

And now I realize
That the stars are in your eyes
'Cause you always shine
Baby you're the greatest

[Verse 2:]
Thought everything had changed
Until the day you came
And took away the pain
Baby you're the greatest
I always wore a frown
I never use to smile
Until you showed me how
Baby you're the greatest

Search high and low for love, just
To find out, that it was here all along, and
I know it, what I wanted it
I should've been chasing you

[Chorus:]
And I was reaching for the stars
Didn't have to look so far
'Cause love's where you are
But I didn't have a clue

And now I realize
That the stars are in your eyes
'Cause you always shine
Baby you're the greatest

[Bridge:]
Reaching for the stars then I bumped into you
And I cannot believe I was searching so long
Ooh baby, I'm so taken
And all that I need is to look into your eyes

[Chorus:]
And I was reaching for the stars
Didn't have to look so far
'Cause love's where you are
But I didn't have a clue

And now I realize
That the stars are in your eyes
'Cause you always shine
Baby you're the greatest
