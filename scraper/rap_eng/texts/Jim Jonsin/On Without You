[Verse 1]
See your shadow even when you're not standing there
I feel you when I close my eyes
I've been through it all and made it out alive
It's only just a matter of time
I won't be (hopeless)
I was so (devoted)
Pieces will come together
I'm so (blinded)
My heart is flat (lining)

[Verse 2]
And I promise you baby that I've tried
But I can't try no more
And I've cried
But I can't cry no more
And I've tried
But I can't try no more
And I've cried
But I can't cry no more
It's just so impossible going
On without you, on without you
No I can't it's impossible going
On without you, on without you
No I can't

[Verse 3]
I hear you walking through the halls and I know you're not home
The thought of you is all that remains
I wonder if I call would you pick up the phone
And tell me that you're feeling the same
There's nothing left (in me)
My day gets so (empty)
Pieces will come together
I tell myself (blindly)
If I'm wrong (my, my)

[Verse 4]
And I'm not giving up baby but I've tried
But I can't try no more (no more baby)
And I've cried
But I can't cry no more (oh yeah)
And I've tried
But I can't try no more
And I've cried
But I can't cry no more
It's just so impossible going
On with out you, on without you
No I can't
It's impossible going
On without you, on without you
No I can't
It's just so impossible

[Verse 5]
I got an empty bed on my right side
I'm missing you now for a lifetime
I tell myself I'm fine
But I'm lying, I'm lying (yeah)

[Verse 6]
And I promise you baby that I've tried
But I can't try no more
And I've cried
But I can't cry no more (no more)
(I'm trying baby)
And I've tried
But I can't try no more
And I've cried
But I can't cry no more
It's just so impossible going
On without you, on without you
No I can't
It's just so impossible going (It's impossible)
On without you, on without you
No I can't
It's just so impossible going
On without you, on without you
No I can't
It's just so impossible going (It's impossible going)
On without you, on without you
No I can't
It's just so impossible going
