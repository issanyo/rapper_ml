[Intro: Usher, Robot & French woman]
Raymond versus Raymond
There's three sides to every story
There's one side, there's the other
And then there's the truth
Usher
Captivating, perfection, innovator, seductive, superstar, music, unparalleled, sex, world renown, dance, tempo, spotlight, passionate, uncomparable
You... are.... what.... we... say.... you... are
Monstar
Black heart
The sound, the sound, the sound, the sound, the sound...
Everything that's on my mind, I just...
I gotta let go
Allez vient on y vas
Bass drum, bass drum, bass drum...
I hope you can handle it
Vient on y vas
Feel my heartbeat
Monstar
Yeah, close your eyes
How bad do you want it?
Monstar
I'ma take you, I can give it to you
Monstar
You begging for it
Monstar

[Verse 1: Usher]
Look what you made me do, baby
Say, you know me
Do you want all of me?
Yeah, you got the other side
You got some nerve, baby
You think you're so bad?
You're so serious
I'm just having fun
Don't you, don't you tell me
Tell me that things get to you without all of that attitude
I feel like you might be the one tonight, baby
You got me so excited, baby

[Bridge: Usher]
Girl, if you lonely and you're longing for a lover
You know I'll be, I'll be here all night
I'm right above you, you don't have to look no further
You know I'll be, I'll be here all night

[Chorus: Usher & French woman]
Monstar
(Ride the elevator)
Tell me how deep you want me to go
(I'm back, celebrate life)
I'm gonna be there, baby
Right there, it's just more than one life
I'll be the pleasure baby love of your life
Monstar

[Interlude 1: Usher & French woman]
What you made me do
Look at what you made me do
Je t'aime, Monstar
What you made me do
Look at what you brought me to

[Verse 2: Usher]
Redefining gravity every time we lay
Every time we go, we go deeper
She said she wanna bring out the beast, but she can't tame it
I'ma let you hose him down with bang, I'ma shoot it like a gun

[Bridge: Usher]
Girl, if you lonely and you're longing for a lover
You know I'll be, I'll be here all night
I'm right above you, you don't have to look no further
You know I'll be, I'll be here all night

[Chorus: Usher & French woman]
Monstar
(Ride the elevator)
Tell me how deep you want me to go
(I'm back, celebrate life)
I'm gonna be there, baby
Right there, it's just more than on elife
I'll be the pleasure baby love of your life
Monstar
(Ride the elevator)
Tell me how deep you want me to go
(I'm back, celebrate life)
I'm gonna be there, baby
Right there, it's just more than one life
I'll be the pleasure baby love of your life
Monstar

[Interlude 2: Usher & French woman]
Look at what you made me do
Look at what you made me do
Look at what you made me do
Look at what you made me do
Look at what you made me do
Look at what you made me do
I'm gonna give it to you
Monstar...
Je t'aime, tu es Monstar
Ca te plait?
Oui, vient avec moi, tu es Monstar

[Bridge: Usher]
Girl, if you lonely and you're longing for a lover
You know I'll be, I'll be here all night

Tell me how deep you want me to go
