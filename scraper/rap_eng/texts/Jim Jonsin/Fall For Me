Hook [Brad Jennings] :
Coolin' in the day time
Love you in the night time
But dont fall for me (dont fall for me)

I can be your life line
I got you for a life-time
When you fall for me (when you fall for me)


Verse [Tommy Swisher]:
The lonely dragon
She, just want to love him
He, could never trust her therefore he could never love her back
Such an imbalance
The things we’ve done on this mattress
The things I seen in that bathroom
Them threesomes wasn't imagined (yeah)
And just admit it you know I switched up your standards
Had no idea what a man was
Until I taught you some manners
I think you need to go home
Cause you've been here too long

Verse 2 [Tommy Swisher]:
Momentary situations leave us lost
Sometimes think we just need the cross
But then we think we need it all
Fuck that we just need unity
And that dont just mean you and me
I want a good relationship but nothing like what you dream
No matrimony for me
Holy Holy you shouldn't hold me a lone beast
Wolverine with torn sheets
These memories starting to scorn me (uh)
But as soon as this liquor comes
Probably won't remember much
And it might be pride but fuck it
Sometimes you need destruction
Sometimes you need a lover
Good God im young its ugly
Why do they choose to love me (Why do they choose to love me)
Sometimes you need destruction
Sometimes you need a lover
Good God im young its ugly
Why do they choose to love me (Why do they choose to love me)
