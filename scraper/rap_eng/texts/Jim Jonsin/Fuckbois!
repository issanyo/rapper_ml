Baby girl, you know he's just bad news
Guys like him will only screw with you
Now on the one hand, he makes you feel like the queen you are
But on the other. He’s only toying with you heart

I could have sworn there was a time when we all wanted love
But now he wants me to come over when he hits me up
But it's 2 in the morning

And I'm whispering Fuckbois!
A term that derived from some poor girl screaming out Fuck Boys!
He got in my head again left me on read again- Fuckbois!
Ohohohoh I’m screaming out Fuck boys! Give me a man!

Baby girl, don't let him play his games
You're gonna leave your bed just to wish you stayed
Saying I shoulda listen to her, I was done with you
Back and fourth on the edge of reason and doing what I shouldn't do

I could have sworn there was a time when we all wanted love, but now he wants me to come over when he hits me up, but it's 4 in the morning

And I'm screaming out Fuckbois!
A term that derived from some poor girl screaming out - Fuck boys!
He got in my head again, left me on read again - Fuckbois!
Ohohohoh I'm screaming out Fuck Boys and give me a man

Saying that you don't play games
But if we’re gonna do this, let’s get one thing straight
You can't walk all over me if you’re watching me walk away

I'm screaming out...
