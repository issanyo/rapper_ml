[Intro: Dappy]
NaNa Niiieee

Girls I fuck with them
I don't usually fall in love with them
But you should be prescribed to me
Some chicks are drugs to men
A lot deserve the finer things in life
And I think your one of them
Money ain't shit I got loads to blow
Show me a signal let me know
If you wanna have a better life then baby you know where to go
Its coming in quick it ain't flowing in slow
Like I said let me know
If Weezy made it rain I can make it snow
(ayeeeee)

[Hook: Dappy & Tulisa]
Girls I'm loving them
But I won't let them get the best of me
Girls I'm loving them
I get them all around the world
What would I do without you
What would you do without me
Don't need to tell you baby
Cause its plain for us to see Tonight
Girls I'm loving them
Girls Girls Girls

[Verse 2: Tulisa]
Guys I fuck with them
They be pinging off my phone
Telling me they all alone
But they sitting in at home
While I'm out tryna get that dough
That's why they call me the baddest bitch
Cause I switch up the roles
I'm the one that drives them crazy
They all wish I was their lady
But I'm earning more than them
And they say "yeah that bitch is crazy"
I am the biggest female boss that ever lived
And everything that you done I've been and did

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Fazer, Dappy & Tulisa]
When your girlfriend says she's on her way
And your staring at the clock in frustration
Thinking why is she so late
I just can't live without them
They'll break your heart
Don't doubt them
I'm the reason why she's never coming back
Simply can't leave me around them
Girls I fuck with them
I tell them anything they wanna hear so by the end of the night
I'm fucking them
Guys I fuck with them
And I know they all gass like mariah
But you know what
I'm in love with them

[Hook]
