[Hook]
Call on me
And I’ll be there
Everyday you need
I’ll be there
You can count on me
I’ll be, I’ll be there
You can count on me
I’ll be there

[Verse 1]
I’m on the ground
But I’m there for you
Ain’t got as question
But I’m there for you
Need a real man
I’m prepared for you
I hold you down
That’s my spot
I know I’ll be out a lot
I like dough a lot
So I’m 24 hours never closing shop
When it comes to you
I don’t think for one
I think for two
We plan the plot
We think it through
I got your back
Like chiropractics
No acrobatics, no safety nets
This is not for practice
In a studio cooking up the practice
Profit passing after you
One thing I cannot lose
If it came down to it
Then I chose

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
I’ll be right there to pull you out of that nightmare
Play dirty, don’t fight fair
Blazin up like we light flairs
That’s the type of shit we on
Get us where we be long
We come, we too strong
They can’t break all bone
I’ll be your doorway
Fresh off the plane from Norway
Ride real one get your forte
Ready for some late night foreplay
This champagne and OJ
From mimosa
They say no pain, you get no gain
But know one thing
I won’t change

[Hook]
