[Verse 1: J. Cole]
Dear Mrs. Bill Collector
I know you're just doing your job, no mean to disrespect ya
But we been going through this thing since way back
I told ya when I get the dough I would pay back
But I got problems baby (yeah, if you only knew)
I got bigger problems baby
So while ya talk about the money that I owe like it's as if I didn't know man it don't mean nothin' to me
Cause right now I got my lil boy crying and my grandmother dying
Could ya please stop fuckin' wit me?
Listen here I ain't lookin' for no tears, but my brother got a year and my moma keep smokin' that shit
On top of that I'm broke, please put that in your notes for the next one to call me up talkin' that shit

[Hook: B.o.B]
So life don't pass me by, cause sometimes it'll leave ya stuck, don't ask me why (why)
Gotta keep this train-a-movin', no time to cry (cry)
So lonely days I say goodbye (bye)
Gotta live for today so life it won't pass me by
Cause sometimes it'll leave ya stuck, don't ask me why (why)
Gotta keep this train-a-movin', no time to cry (cry)
So lonely days I say goodbye (bye)
Gotta live for today so life it won't pass me by

[Verse 2: J. Cole]
Dear Mr. Policeman
Am I wrong, ain't you supposed to keep the peace, man?
I coulda swore that I was driving pretty peaceful
So why the hell is you pulling over me for?
Is it this black Mercedes? (Oh na, I get it, I get it, I get it)
Or cause I'm black, hmm, maybe?
Tell me why my hands start sweating and I hold my breathe every time you get behind me
I turn my music down so you won't hear a sound, man I'm nervous like I got a couple pounds on me
You pull me over, ya frown on me
With your flashlight, tell me, what do you see?
Thug niggas, drug-dealers its a trip
Every nigga in this whip got a mothafuckin' college degree

[Verse 3: J. Cole]
My middle finger to the law, bustin' off, tryin' to touch the sky
My teacher said, "Impossible", but I'mma fuckin' try
Plus how he gon' tell me, he don't make the rules
There's niggas dying everyday, we don't make the news
Instead they talk about some thunderstorm, cyclones
Timmy got his bike stole
Top story: Tiger Woods be fuckin' a these white hoes
Anchorman stop snitchin'
Cut to commercial, he be textin' all his side bitches
Hey ma-goodness, how ironic
I'm tryed for possession of some chronic
My lawyer came to court, man he was higher than the comet
Hey your Honor, is you kidding, how you sit above me?
Are you perfect mothafucka? How you finna to judge me?
When you home you don't cuss, drink and puff like us?
These cops is Bad Boys, they be just like Puff
They hate their jobs and their days be fucked up like us
At the end of the day, you niggas just like us
