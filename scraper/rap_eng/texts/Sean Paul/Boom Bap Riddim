(We're the best)
Gangsta for life

And the sea of Chengay that see no one
Me and other nigga pound it or I will hit a flows
After that fatigue that it and I'll me or I spot
Things are conferment Kelly I'll be not kind of court
Hey, no one sees I wanna hoot that crowd
And I seek that I wanna heal that crowd
Turn the role and it eat your soul
And appear some in front as I let my eyes on
Oh, dear it's real, take that hard or easy want to feel
We rub and steal, life's on like weird
Don't think it's real, take that hard or easy want to feel
We rub and steal, life's on like weird
Look, in the ghetto, ghetto
And look in the ghetto, ghetto
This ain't won't see in my car, that entrain where people live or have
Watch up your very friends close, see the arts
Once that friend no ain't bus in the dark
Jail that and music it's tight, keep's on the kiss 'cause I wanna try
Any cop caught the line before slain, take is to ass or in front of a line
We caught now just a victory, real nigga sticks to me
(My dog)
People think that I beg for me, now I smith empty I climb for me
Oh, dear it's real, take that hard or easy want to feel
We rub and steal, life's on like weird
Don't think it's real, big that hard or easy want to feel
We rub and steal, life's on like weird
(Oh dear it's real, real life, real, real)
(Got link that, EOA)
