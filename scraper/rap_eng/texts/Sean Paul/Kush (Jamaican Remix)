Look up ina di sky, you see me, not the plane, go up!
Higher than di T- to di Pain, (ah!)
Think a lie, the I can ask I-Octane, yeah
Pass me the herbs

Ina di ghetto, brain feel like it up ina one a di hill, in di suburb
Fly high like di eagle, higher than the rest of birds,heh

Mi supplied by the Squady and the Sargy
Ina mi brain, the herbs a massage mi
Mi and di grades and the wizzler is a army

Stay ina Miami smell di fumes to the vapour

Talking bout di Marley, not the white snowflake-ah,yeah
Wi have it ina every flavour

Taking over every acre

[4th Verse: Spragga Benz]
Well di green and brown and chocolate mek mi brain stain yow
Di orange and purple mek mi brain look like a rainbow
Nuff grades weh ina di world, but them nuh burn the same though
Di 'mack of ikya' better than the 'high joe'
Then the African, Indica and the 'Westmoreland bum' charge mi up
Take it out pon the gyal dem, zoom, zoom
Gone ina di hills, but anuh coffee, a 'jah bloom' mi go for
I alla fill a container,den
One a mi limky come from Naggos Head
Gimme a draw, but it wasn't longspread
You know some $20 bag weh full a stick like tread
Make you hungry, make you mash up all a crackers an bread
Mi build it up, but mi couldn't light that
Although the 'red herring grabber' did hot
Highest mi puff, you know mi level nah drop
It haffi organic an fertilized by the rat-bat

[5th Verse: Sean Paul]
Strictly high grade wi a blaze it
Ina di country pipe or dream wi nah taste it
No cocaine, you know seh dat, wi nah lace it
S to di P boil it dung ina di oil
Now put it ina yuh food an taste it
Lick off yuh face with

Nuff a dem a complain seh mi get crazy
Like dem never know seh nothing can't phase mi
Quick purle liaise mi
Hey yow, pill them a tek an them a run up ina death
Like dem never know high grade mek mi brain set
Yow nuff a dem a fret

Cause them can't fly high like S.P.-lia jet
Up, up, up ina di sky, mi nah come back yet
And you nah fi ask why, take you money and bet
I'm high baby
And mi full a joy baby
If you can't see me, then look ina di sky

[6th Verse: Collie Buddz]
