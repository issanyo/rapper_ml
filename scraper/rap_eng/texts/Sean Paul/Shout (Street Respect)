Hear you shout
Dutty them a tell them once again a yow!
Sly them a tell them once again hey yow!
Sean Paul and we a tell them once again
Taxi haffi set the new trend yow

Kick up the bass up and make i bun up the
Place up... make i pick up the pace up and
Make them wine up the waist up
We them want fi erase up but we style them
Embrace up... but them can't stop the music
So great up weh we create up
Me say year onto year me haffi a tell them
Straight up... man a no punk man a no fool...
Definite we a sent no bait up
Unu fi listen to the lyrics 'pon de riddim weh
We state up... if you love how we sound let
Me see you hand them wave up

From you love the lyrics coming out me
Mouth mouth mouth... no doubt caw we got
The street respect and you know say that it
Never counterfeit yet... vibes whe you get

Me want fi hear you shout shout shout
From you love the lyrics coming out me
Mouth mouth mouth... no doubt caw we got
The street respect and you know say that it
Never counterfeit yet... vibes whe you get

We block it and rock it and make thwm just
Can't forgot it... when we chat it we lock it
And now see them a follow back it... them
Want fi copycat it but a we a top a top it...
Them no want fi see we clock it neither fi
See we chop it... them use it and fuse it that
A de history of we music... when we fan them
A choose it should a never let them abuse it
Them a try fi confuse it like them want we fi
Lose it... but all weh them a gwaan we still
Deh ya a boost it... just turn up the treble
And the bass make it play... party non-stop
From a night till a day... and no matter weh
The hypocrite and critic them a say... reggae
Music deh ya fi stay... weh me go so then
