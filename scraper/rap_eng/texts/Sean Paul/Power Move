(Verse 1: Vybz Kartel)
Dem nuh si weh mi go
Fool still a suffocate in a the dust
Nuh matter how mi beat dem It’s never enough
Yard people is really very tough
Hand grenade, one second delay
Dem a run, wi run without relay
Still aim!
Shell dem down the boss remain
Mi been here, disappear in tin air
And come back
Been there and done that
Is there a number? Mi set the standard
And defend the culture
Even if wid gunshot, people will puncher
You better prepare fi judgement
We walk and thunder
Immortal combat wi laugh and buss that
Breeze off a clutch back
Wi nah go back down, gravity fuck that
