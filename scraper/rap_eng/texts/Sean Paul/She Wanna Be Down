Your grind? Yeah, yeah
You're charged with possess in other people property
Yes, your honor, I'm guilty of trudge
But you know what?
Let me tell you a story, alright, yo, yo, yo

She wanna be down with me everyday
And she no want nobody in her way
Say she don't want a clown, she do what I say
And I would never ever lead her a stray

She wanna be down with me everyday
And she no want nobody in her way
Say she don't want a clown, today is going away
So your grind, it is the road that I play

That's why me go stop that, 'cause the boy left the gal
Gone work pon the laptop, talk about him have hot job
Soon get a promotion, reach all the top notch

Me give her the broke back, me give her the style
Make the neck get crock back, broke up to the work shop
Mash up everything pon all the shelf and work not
And when she a beg stop, still put it on 'cause dutty never yet flop
Me a tell her say "Guess what?"

We done know the bed, make her move to the desktop
And all the little rest pot
Catch up her bed, get ready for the next lap
Her leg them flex back, she want me to give
Her it straight and bless that

She wanna be down with me everyday
And she no want nobody in her way
Say she don't want a clown, she do what I say
And I would never ever lead her a stray

She wanna be down with me everyday
And she no want nobody in her way
Say she don't want a clown, today is going away
So your grind, it is the road that I play

So we stay with the u, la, lay
We no wrong none at all, we nuh line her day
Just gimme the gal them, ready to want them
Gal them love me to sing we song them
Gal them call me to solve the problem
Gal them know so me nah go corn them
Nah go left them, that's the anthem

Shout it out from the highest mountain
Woman a me life
Every man should sing this song to
But some don't know what them a do

Mislead in the girls bag of lu
Well baby, it's alright
I've been with you so many mood
So all rudebwoy just never lu
Never into, never had no crew that

She wanna be down with me everyday
And she no want nobody in her way
Say she don't want a clown, she do what I say
And I would never ever lead her a stray

She wanna be down with me everyday
And she no want nobody in her way
Say she don't want a clown, today is going away
So your grind, it is the road that I play

She know it, I flow with the way she really want it
She make about mine just to get my attention
So she just have flown it, she want me horny
That's why she'll be up morning
Stinking about what she can do to satisfy your yearning

She keep it burning like a flame and so eternal do the same
Stirring the pant and keeping it up to you
Girl, that's my game and Mr. P Man, it's my name
Give it to the gal them, make them fly up high like a plane
Could I, I obtain?

She wanna be down with me everyday
And she no want nobody in her way
Say she don't want a clown, she do what I say
And I would never ever lead her a stray

She wanna be down with me everyday
And she no want nobody in her way
Say she don't want a clown, today is going away
So your grind, it is the road that I play
