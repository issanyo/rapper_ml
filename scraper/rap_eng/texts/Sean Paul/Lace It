Gal mi love how you holdin' it tightly
Love how you move it, movin' it rightly
Set the pace and run this whole nightly
No time to waste, I'm lacin' this nicely

Deal with it madda mad mad, crazy and sickle
Mek she wiggle and whistle when me send on the missle

Heart a beat, a so di gal a give trouble

The full installment, me make sure fi set it
She may exquisite and she want me up in it, so me
