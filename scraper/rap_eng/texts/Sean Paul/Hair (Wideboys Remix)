[Intro: Sean Paul]
Cause Sean-da-Paul him a d man fi get it done

[Verse 1: Leigh-Anne & Perrie & Jesy & (Jade)]
I call my girl cause I got a problem
Only a curl is gonna solve it
Then I don't really care
Just get him out of my hair, yeah
Let's switch it up, get it off my shoulder
I've had enough, can't take it no longer
I'm over him I swear
I'm like yeah

[Pre-Chorus: All]
Gotta get him out my hair
Gotta get him out my hair

[Chorus]
Cause he was just a d*** and I knew it
Got me going mad sitting in this chair
Like I don't care
Gotta get him out my hair

[Sean Paul]
Still I chat note

[Verse 2: Jade & Jesy & Perrie & Leigh-Anne]
Okay, gonna bleach him out, peroxide on him
Hair on the floor like my memory of him
Now I feel brand new
This chick is over you
We're going out, ain't got no worries
Drama now, now it just seems so funny
Put my hands up in the air
I'm like yeah

[Chorus]
Cause he was just a d*** and I knew it
Got me going mad sitting in this chair
Like I don't care
Gotta get him out my hair
I tried everything but it's useless
He pushed me so far now I'm on the edge
Make him disappear
Go get him out my hair

[Verse 3: Sean Paul]
Yow, yow
It terrible at the beginning when we started
Good chemistry between me and you, girl, we got it
I feed you game, and just to tame you was my target
That was my aim, just to be playing with your body
Thought that forever we could continue this party
And now you telling me that your love is departed
Right, I'm just saying you gon' miss your Sugar Daddy
How you gon' ask me bout your hair, girl, when I bought it?

[Bridge: Jade & All]
Girlfriend you need to catch up on him, erase that number
Don’t call him back cause he don’t deserve it
And when you see him in the club, just flip your hair
Don't show him any love cause you've had enough, woah oh

[Outro]
Cause he was just a d*** and I knew it
Got me going mad sitting in this chair
Like I don't care
Gotta get him out my hair
I tried everything but it's useless
He pushed me so far now I'm on the edge
Make him disappear
Go get him out my hair
