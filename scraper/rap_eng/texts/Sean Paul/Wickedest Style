Just can't get enough... (x2)

(Hook)
Baby girl just give em the wickedest style
Give em the wickedest style
Put it down, let it down, let them see you glow fire
Give em the wickedest style
Give em the wickedest style
Drop to the floor, I got the money empire
Give em the wickedest style
Give em the wickedest style
Wind for the world, you know you’re well versatile
Give em the wickedest style
Give em the wickedest style
Getting money straight, the money pile up

(Verse: Sean Paul)
Because if we’ll smoke two pon repeater
Poppin in 2, does em buckle up me feet
Hennessey get out the break bomb, taking out the D cup
Money on the clique touch the street well made up
Run it up, we link up, put the drink
I did done stink up
And now my friend that bring come and sip pon the big cup
Selector posed to dance on the block then I raise up
Give me the microphone, now let me sing something, girl

(Pre-Hook)
You should know
The way you bumpin it
I feel it now, you’re feelin it up
Drop it low
Show me what you’re workin with, girl you show me, we burn it up
Take it slow
Girl I’m on the grind, fightin
You know you should be workin it up
What you do
Give me the ting girl cuz I just can’t get enough

(Hook)
Now give em the wickedest style
Give em the wickedest style
Put it down, let it down, let them see you glow fire
Give em the wickedest style
Give em the wickedest style
Drop to the floor, I got the money empire
Give em the wickedest style
Give em the wickedest style
Wind for the world, you know you’re well versatile
Give em the wickedest style
Give em the wickedest style
Getting money straight, the money pile up

(Verse: Iggy Azalea)
Rude boy what you want cause you push pon me waist
I know you falling in love from that look pon yo face
If I leave it there for you could you pick it up, pick it up
Got a hell of an appetite, let me know if you big enough
I'm talking high life, such a high price but we pay
Do this all night. Everything be alright, that’s what we say
So original, super wicked style, we get wild
If it’s right how we does it now, how you like me now?
Money talks, if you without it then don't mention my name
Ain’t no competition within me and they make the same
Need a Benz or a Bentley just to get in my lane
Flyin private, we get at it til they see me on the plane
Talkin fly right til we turn night into day
We could take time and never waste time cuz I don’t play
So original, super wicked style, super wicked
I can give it to you but tell me what you gon do, wit' it tell me

(Pre-Hook)
You should know
The way you bumpin it
I feel it now, you’re feelin it up
Drop it low
Show me what you’re workin with, girl you show me, we burn it up
Take it slow
Girl I’m on the grind, fightin
You know you should be workin it up
What you do
Give me the ting girl cuz I just can’t get enough

(Hook)
Now give em the wickedest style
Give em the wickedest style
Put it down, let it down, let them see you glow fire
Give em the wickedest style

Give em the wickedest style
Wind for the world, you know you’re well versatile
Give em the wickedest style
Give em the wickedest style
Getting money straight, the money pile up
