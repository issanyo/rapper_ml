Alright then, alright then

[Verse 1]

We fi build Jamaica and stop from kill
Skill, we fi skill, we fi sharpen we skill
Don't end up in a none a the prison weh dem build
Till we fi till, we fi till up the soil
And build up we coil, plant food pon the hill
Jamaica brilliant and we resilient
Time get hard but we nah left yah still cau

[Chorus]
This is a fi mi town this a fi mi district
This a fi mi home and mi nah left alone yow
This a fi mi town this a fi mi district
Saying it again just in case you missed it

Yah so weh mi born and grown mi nah misfit
This a fi mi town this a fi mi district

[Verse 2]
Youth in a the street dem need a role model
So dem can see how fi reach the pinnacle
Life it hard and a nuff obstacle
So you haffi check deep because di road sipple
Build we fi build up we coil till it triple
I must insist every mukkle make a mickle
Be kind to the blind and be kind to the cripple
Every man was once a baby pon nipple
Chill we fi chill and stop floss sometime
Spend dollars and coin pon education
Read you fi read, you fi read, you fi read
That Marcus Garvey tell the nation
Check out the vibe and the meditation
Nuff people under sufferation
Nuff people under frustration
But we haffi build back
Cau better must come cau

[Chorus]
This is a fi mi town this a fi mi district
This a fi mi home and mi nah left alone yow
This a fi mi town this a fi mi district
Saying it again just in case you missed it
This a fi mi town this a fi mi district
Yah so weh mi born and grown mi nah misfit
This a fi mi town this a fi mi district
Jamaica, go so den
