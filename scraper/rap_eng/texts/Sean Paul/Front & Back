[Intro:]
Set di gyal dem front and back (x3)
Cau' dem ready fi di meditation like that

Cause she know mi a di king

Set good nuh gyal, give me di kotch and timing
And brace it back, just like that

Girl cau' you hot, see seh that you fat
Bruk out, bruk out gyal, just like that
Deh 'pon the top
Never gonna flop; never gonna stop, gyal
Just like that
Gyal every man a see you
Just a launch an' attack
Love 'ow you drop it now, pick it up back (x2)
Earthquake wine causin' heart attack

[Chorus:]
I know you feel it girl
A fever burning and it's so hot
I got that remedy for you

Sean-a peezy we deyah pon track
Set di gyal dem front and back (x2)
Cau' dem ready fi di meditation like that

And mi just wah connect it
And mi well wah wet it

Push it right back
Wine and go down to di ground
Push up, push up
Drink up di rum gyal, get inna di zone
Tell di selecta fi tun up di sound
Make all di gyal dem flock and surround
We and di gyal dem a talk a di town

Fat like pound, p-pound
