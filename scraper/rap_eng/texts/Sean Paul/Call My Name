Ta dah, tah dah, a dutty yo again
Ta dah, tah dah, a dutty yo again
So mi go so again

Chorus:
Sometimes I hear yuh calling out my name
And I can hear deep dung inna mi brain
If I'm a fool I only got myself to blame (self to blame, self to blame)
Well I can see the sign cause I'm not blind
All though your not mine from time to time
I got to make you know, you are my sunshine (my sunshine, my sunshine)

I love you baby, but yuh nuh love mi back why?
Yuh drive mi crazy cause yuh fi gi mi dat bligh
Yuh mek mi high, I just can't deny
Love positive just a build up inna I and I
Jus gi mi deh privilege and runaway yuh man
I got the plan fi mek yuh turn on
Baby, just believe mi cause my word is my bond
Sometimes I hear yuh, but I'm hearing wrong, girl!

[Chorus:]
Sometimes I hear yuh calling out my name
And I can hear deep dung inna mi brain
If I'm a fool I only got myself to blame (self to blame, self to blame)
Well I can see the sign cause I'm not blind
All though your not mine from time to time
I got to make you know that you are my sunshine (my sunshine, my sunshine)

[Verse 2:]:
Rude bwoy loving a nuh sumting fi she ramp wid,(true, true)
Everyman him need a woman fi be him live blanket
If she did say spank it, yuh hold dat and crank it
If she neva love yuh good, yuh know yuh would a flank it
Babygirl, yuh know a love yuh, but yuh falla yuh friend dem
Now yuh gone and break Sean Paul heart in two

[Chorus:]
Sometimes I hear yuh calling out my name
And I can hear deep dung inna mi brain
If I'm a fool I only got myself to blame (self to blame, self to blame)
Well I can see the sign cause I'm not blind
All though your not mine from time to time
I got to make you know that you are my sunshine (my sunshine, my sunshine)

Verse4:
Tick tock mi get heart attack, When mi hear she leaving and she nah come back
Mi caan believe mi dream so mi love world just crash
A lucky ting she neva know weh mi hide mi stash, but

[Chorus:]
Sometimes I hear yuh calling out my name
And I can hear deep dung inna mi brain
If I'm a fool I only got myself to blame (self to blame, self to blame)
Well I can see the sign cause I'm not blind
All though your not mine from time to time
I got to make you know that you are my sunshine (my sunshine, my sunshine)
