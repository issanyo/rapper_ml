[Intro: Sean Paul]
Shake that thing miss Kana Kana
Shake that thing miss Annabella
Shake that thing ya Donna Donna
Jodi and Rebecca

[Bridge: Sean Paul]
Woman get busy, just shake that booty non-stop
When the beat drops, just keep swinging it
Get jiggy, get crunked up, percolate
Anything you want to call it, oscillate you hip but don’t
Take pity, me want fi see you get live
’pon the riddim when me ride and me lyrics I provide
Electricity, gal nobody can tell you nuttin’
Ca’ you don’ know your destiny

[Verse 1: Sean Paul]
Yo sexy ladies want par with us
In a the car with us, them nah war with us
In a the club them want flex with us
To get next to us, them can’ flex with us
From the day me born Jah ignite me flame
Gal a call me name and it is my fame
It’s all good girl turn me on
’til a early morn’, let’s get it on

[Chorus Transition 1: From Sean Paul to the (Gorillaz)]
Let's get it on, let's get it on, let's get it on
Let's get it on (It’s comin on)
(It’s comin on, it’s comin on, it’s comin on)

[Gorillaz x2]
I ain't happy, I'm feeling glad
I got sunshine in a bag
I'm useless but not for long
The future is coming on

[Chorus Transition 2: From the Gorillaz to (Sean Paul)]
It’s comin on
It’s comin on (Let's get it on)
It’s comin on (Let's get it on)
(Let's get it on)

[Chorus ending: Sean Paul]
Let’s get it on ’til a early morning
Girl it’s all good just turn me on

[Bridge 2: Sean Paul]
Ya don’t sweat it, don’t get agitate ya gwan rotate
Ca’ anything you want you know
You must get it, from you name a mention
Don’t ease the tension, ya run the program
Gals wan pet it, ya have a good time
Gal free up u’ ya mind, ca’ nobody can dis you
Man won’t let it, can you a the number one gal
Wave you hand, make them see de wedding band

[Verse 1: Sean Paul]
