[Verse 1: Pitbull]
It's Mr. W W and Sean Paul, big dogs, for sure
I'm from the city where they hustlin', hustlin', hustlin'
Rick Ross
Blood, sweat, tears, just to eat a meal
So I crawl, walk, run and I got a deal
I'ma hop, skip, jump, for my hundred mill
I'm a climate change, I make hot, I make em chill
Wa ah gwan Jamiaca Sak pasé n'ap boulé to my Haitians
Catch me carnival with Macheal Montano, one time Trini massive invasions
Shutting down India, Indonesia, Malaysia
The way chico dress, is sharp as a razor
Get the game wide open, like a woman in labour
Respect it later

You got me in a trance

Alright, she doesn't mind, alright, she doesn't mind
Girl I got you so
