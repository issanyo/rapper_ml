Hey, what you're doing in here?
Well, I'm the wedding crasher!
Wedding crasher?! yow!
Hahaha

[Intro 2: Future Fambo]
Just left from the bachelor's party
A lot of drinks, and a lot of shorties
My occupation is to crash party
If you don't know, you better ask somebody!

[Chorus: Sean Paul]
Well a di wedding crashers dem call we

When we pass di security and they didn't realize
Somebody said, "he's the brother of the bride."

[Verse 3: Sean Paul]

Inna di dance floor, middle of di dance
