(Verse 1)
Step out the Caddy Deville
It's on a base of steel
Them boys checkin us out
Know when we dress to kill
Struttin in the club, it's dark
But still got my shades on
I hear the Dj mixin Youngbloodz
To that Whisper Song

(Bridge)
We from the city that make it Okay to
To make clubbin' a year-round holiday
So if you feelin right, grab the Kryptonite
If this yo song tonight, then it's on tonight

(Hook)
Bounce wit it drop wit it
Lean wit it rock wit it
Snap wit it
All my ladies pop yo backs wit it
Do it do it do it do it
You know the world be rockin' to it to it
So do it do it do it to it
Bounce wit it drop wit it
Lean wit it rock wit it

All my fellas tip yo hats wit it
Do it do it do it do it
You know the world be rockin' to it to it
So do it do it do it to it

(Verse 2)
No need to ask where I'm from
You already know
I represent the A from my head to my toes
Step on the dance floor
Watch and learn cuz here I go
I throw my hands up
And work my body to the floor

(Bridge)
We from the city that make it Okay to
To make clubbin' a year-round holiday
So if you feelin right, grab the Kryptonite
If this yo song tonight, then it's on tonight

(Hook)
Bounce wit it drop wit it
Lean wit it rock wit it
Snap wit it
All my ladies pop yo backs wit it
Do it do it do it do it
