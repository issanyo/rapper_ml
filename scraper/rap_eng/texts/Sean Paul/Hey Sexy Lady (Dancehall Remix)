Big Will Yo!
I first met ya had a sense I was bound to get ya
Gotta be honest ma I'm astounded with ya
Magazine Latina where I found your picture
Fat shout to my manager had to get ya
Made contact sent the G4 for ya
My butler Carlos opened up my door for ya
Little picnic laid out on my floor for ya
Gimme the rock I'm a score for ya
Made a classic move were the rich and the famous
Take you see places you don't know what the name is
Make you eat food you don't know what the name is
Lace you with designers you don't know what the name is
Go to buy a globe I could point you where Spain is
Take you to the airport to see where the plane is
On a long flight, lay out where my aim is
Shaggy, Sean Paul y'all know what the game is come on.....
