[Intro: Sean Paul]
Fuse ODG and Speezy
What we tell dem? Blaze dem!

[Chorus: Fuse ODG]
Look at you in that dress
Girl you dangerous like a gun
Give them you nothing less
Girl you murder everyone
Your love is a killer
Your love is a killer, heyy
Look at you
Look at you in that dress
Girl you dangerous like a gun
Give them you nothing less
Girl you murder everyone
Your love is a killer
Your love is a killer, heyy
Look at you

[Verse 1: Fuse ODG]
Somebody call the popo, popo
Cause the way that she is looking is so cold, so cold
If you ain’t ready then you need to go home
Everywhere, can see her rolling on solo, solo
She got me begging oh no, oh no
And she all upon me like a logo, logo
But I’m not complaining, my baby let’s go go go
She kill them with the dance
She murder with her waist
Everybody watching when she turn up in the place
You ain’t got a chance if you really tryin'a race
She already at the finish line with her face
A shawty went down then she went low
Gave it to her better like she in a relay
The craziest thing is she don’t know
How beautiful she is everyday

[Chorus: Fuse ODG]
Look at you in that dress
Girl you dangerous like a gun
Give them you nothing less
Girl you murder everyone
Your love is a killer
Your love is a killer, heyy
Look at you
