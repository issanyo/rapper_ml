No grill ya with no lecture

Done out da part weh you got inna ya center
But you know you nah let dem guy deh affect ya
Yo, yo, gyal

Beside of dem, and dem say dem tired of the liars dem
Friars and connivers that will neva eva get inside of dem
Decliner dem, especially the money hider dem
Watchie Watchie gyal bout dem a try fi make a bride a dem
Denied again, some of dem a move like a spider man
Gyal dem say dem nah open wide again
Yo
