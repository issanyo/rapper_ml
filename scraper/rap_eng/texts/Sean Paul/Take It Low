(Sean Paul)
When SP Up Di Place We a Turn It Up
High Grade, Now You Feel So You Burn It Up
And a Sit By Di Kids, We a Surf It Up
We a Stick To Di Peace, Now Swerving Up
Too Late To Dem Keep Hatin' Us
Can’t Nothing Dem a Do, Ain’t Phasin' Us
From The Side Them Been Underrating Us
But The Girl That See Some Great In Us

(Pre-Hook)
Aye, Let’s Have It Lovely Like That You See?
Love The Girl Pretty, You Can Reach Underneath
Sucka Think Dem a Get To Me
Dem a Get Fi Greedy With The Lovin' On It
All Week We Await Fi Do It
All Week We Await Fi Di Beat
It’s Weekend Now So We Can Go Get It On And Move At Full Speed

(Hook)
Aye Baby Girl I Wanna See You Drop It Low
Up Up And Down Just Like a Stripper On a Pole
Girl Shake It Up
Too Much Cone, Just Drink It Up
Girl Make It Like We a Fuck
Aye Girl Just Take It Low

(Bridge)
Take It Low, Take It Low
Take It Low, Take It Low
Take It Low, Take It Low

(Verse)
On Di Area Live We a Cruise
Comin' Through, Steady Waitin' For a Chance
I Love Di Girl Dem a Blues
And I Tell Dem Confuse

Out Of The Club, Back To The Yacht
That’s How We Do, Me And Di Crew
My Girl, Take It All

(Pre-Hook)
Aye, Let’s Have It Lovely Like That You See?
Love The Girl Pretty, You Can Reach Underneath
Sucka Think Dem a Get To Me
Dem a Get Fi Greedy With The Lovin' On It
All Week We Await Fi Do It
All Week We Await Fi Di Beat
It’s Weekend Now So We Can Go Get It On And Move At Full Speed

(Hook)
Aye Baby Girl I Wanna See You Drop It Low
Up Up And Down Just Like a Stripper On a Pole
Girl girl Shake It Up
Too Much Cone, Just Drink It Up

Aye Girl Just Take It Low
