[Intro]
Are you ready?

[Verse 1: "One Kiss"]
One kiss is all it takes
Fallin' in love with me
Possibilities
I look like all you need
One kiss is all it takes
Fallin' in love with me
Possibilities
I look like all you need

Let me take the night, I love real easy
And I know that you'll still wanna see me
On the Sunday morning, music real loud
Let me love you while the moon is still out

Something in you lit up heaven in me
The feeling won't let me sleep
'Cause I'm lost in the way you move, the way you feel

One kiss is all it takes
Fallin' in love with me
Possibilities
I look like all you need
One kiss is all it takes
Fallin' in love with me
Possibilities
I look like all you need

(One)
I look like all you need
(One)
I look like all you need

(I look like all you need)
(I look, I look like)
(Look, I look like all you need)
(One, one, one, one...)

[Verse 2: "No Lie," Sean Paul & Dua Lipa]
Baby girl, yuh a carry ten ton a phatness, gimme some a' dat
Mixed wid the badness, look how she hot
Shaped like goddess, but a nah jus dat
Good piece 'a mentals under di cap
Hot piece of frame an mi love how yuh trod
Watching every step 'a di pepper deh whe yuh got
Stayin' in ma brain, memory cyah detach
Mainly my aim is to give you this love

Hypnotic, the way you move
Let me acknowledge the way you do
And I would not lie, baby you
Beam me up like Scotty
Well, it's hypnotic, the way you move
That's why I wanted to get to you
And I would not lie, baby you
Move so hypnotic

No lie-i-ie
Gyal we never miss
Feel your eyes, they're all over me
Don't be shy, take control of me
Get the vibe, it's gonna be lit tonight
Gyal we never miss, gyal we never miss
No li-i-i-ie
Hypnotized, pull another one
It's alright, I know what you want
Get the vibe, it's gonna be lit tonight
Gyal we never miss, gyal we never miss

[Verse 3: "Be the One"]
Hey, I see the moon, I see the moon, I see the moon
Oh, when you're looking at the sun
You're not a fool, I'm not a fool, not a fool
No, you're not fooling anyone

Oh baby, come on, let me get to know you
Just another chance so that I can show
That I won't let you down and run
No, I won't let you down and run
'Cause I could be the one
I could be the one
I could be the one

[Verse 4: "IDGAF"]
You say you're sorry, but it's too late now
So save it, get gone, shut up
'Cause if you think I care about you now
Well, boy, I don't give a

I see you tryna' get to me
I see you beggin' on your knees (Please)
Boy, I don't give a
So stop tryna' get to me
Tch, get up off your knees
'Cause, boy, I don't give a uh, uh, uh

[Verse 5: "New Rules"]
(One, one, one, one...)

Talkin' in my sleep at night, makin' myself crazy
(Out of my mind, out of my mind)
Wrote it down and read it out, hopin' it would save me
(Too many times, too many times)

One: Don't pick up the phone
You know he's only callin' 'cause he's drunk and alone
Two: Don't let him in
You'll have to kick him out again
Three: Don't be his friend
You know you're gonna wake up in his bed in the morning
And if you're under him, you ain't gettin' over him

I got new rules, I count 'em (Hey, come on!)
I got new rules, I count 'em
I gotta tell them to myself
I got new rules, I count 'em
I gotta tell them to myself (Come on!)

Don't let him in, don't let him in
Don't, don't, don't, don't...
Don't be his friend, don't be his friend
Don't, don't, don't, don't...
Don't let him in, don't let him in
Don't, don't, don't, don't...
Don't be his friend, don't be his friend
Don't, don't, don't...
You're gettin' over him
