[Intro]
Straight connection!
Girl em need a section
Sean Paul sing fi di gyal, dem boy make dem know
Girl you go slow then again yo

[Verse 1]
When I ride
You ride
Baby girl until the end of time
Can’t lose, nah lose
Girl cause we keepin it so exciting
In my mind I get high
I hit the lights and start caressing them thighs
She’s mine but she wanna me do is love with the lights on

[Hook]
She wants it with the lights on
She wants it with the lights on
That's what she say while I'm up in her throat
Uh-la-la-la
Don’t want it all
Uh-la-la-la
Steady rockin her though
Uh-la-la-la
Why she singing that song?
Uh-la-la-la

[Verse 2]
Gyal believe
No lie
And I’m lookin at a woman so fine
Cause she so fly
She make me feel just like I’m a child again
My ego, my pride won't let me leave without her tonight
And how she want me
Take her back up to the crib and turn the lights on

[Hook]
She wants it with the lights on
She wants it with the lights on
That's what she say while I'm up in her throat
Uh-la-la-la
Don’t want it all
Uh-la-la-la
Steady rockin her though
Uh-la-la-la
Why she singing that song?
Uh-la-la-la

[Bridge x2]
Red Light stop
Green Light go
Switch on the yellow light when you want it slow

[Hook]
She wants it with the lights on
She wants it with the lights on
She wants it with the lights on
She wants it with the lights on
That's what she say while I'm up in her throat
Uh-la-la-la
Don’t want it all
Uh-la-la-la
Steady rockin her though
Uh-la-la-la
Why she singing that song?
Uh-la-la-la
That's what she say while I'm up in her throat
Uh-la-la-la
Don’t want it all
Uh-la-la-la
Steady rockin her though
Uh-la-la-la

Uh-la-la-la

She wants it with the lights on
She wants it with the lights on
Give her it, giver her it
Give her it, giver her it
