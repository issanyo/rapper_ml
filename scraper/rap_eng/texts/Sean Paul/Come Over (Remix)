[Intro: Sean Paul]
Speak to my baby girl with the sexy little attitude
Off the topic you know that's really rude
Stay on me topic girl you know you've got me in the mood
Sean Paul! Estelle!

[Verse 1: Estelle]
If I was to tell you just how much I need you, would you come tonight?
Or would you not believe me cause a love that easy never turns out right
I'm trying to change the rules you deserve something good in your life
We've waited for far too long so come get your blessing tonight baby

[Chorus: Estelle & Sean Paul]
Won't you come over love so I can show you love? (straight away)
Promise I got enough to give you all that you need, baby
So many search to find, a love that is good as mine (it's a sign)
I will not waste your time so bring it all to me baby (Estelle, alright)

[Verse 2: Sean Paul]
Girl I've been waiting for the longest time
Just to run come and give you this love (yeah yeah)
Girl you know that you've been on my mind
Can't sleep at night and such
Baby girl
Now that you have shown me the sign if press gas
Don't bother with the clutch
Baby girl, I'm gonna give you loving all night long
So strong that you won't forget my touch, baby girl

[Verse 3: Estelle]
Baby let me teach you, give you love instruction, show you what I know
Need to take it easy, no need rush it, baby go nice and slow
All this love I can give to you, I expect just a bit in return
You don't have to be perfect love as long as you're willing to learn baby

[Chorus: Estelle & Sean Paul]
Won't you come over love (baby girl), So I can show you love (show me girl)

[Verse 3: Sean Paul]
So let me tell you that my adrenaline is pumpin'
I'm thinkin' of one thing between you and me
Listen me, girl
Is the pace is too fast for you, baby?
Then we can take it more slowly
It's your world I take you to the top
I never drop you never flop you
