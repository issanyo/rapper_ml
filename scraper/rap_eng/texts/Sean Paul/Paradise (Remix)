Searchin' for the right lady (Sean Paul Intro)

Refr√£o
Welcome to the Garden of Eden
I call it heaven
I like to call it even Paradise
It feels like ridin' on a wave
And it makes you wanna stay
You just might fall in love
I'd like to welcome you to Paradise
Welcome to Paradise

Boy you're so bad, you're so bad, oh oh oh oh
True gentleman wit swagga
Sexy laid back
Sunshine everywhere you go
Boy you're so bad, you're so bad, oh oh oh oh
Wanna welcome you to my castle
You ain't gotta ask got the key now open the door to my Paradise

Now listen to the beat of the Congo
Like two animals in the jungle makin' love like we do
Shootin stars and rainbows are waiting to be seen
Here you'll find your pot of gold
If you just come & see

Welcome to the Garden of Eden
I call it heaven
I like to call it even Paradise
It feels like ridin' on a wave
And it makes you wanna stay
You just might fall in love
I'd like to welcome you to Paradise
Welcome to Paradise
