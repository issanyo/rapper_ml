[Chorus]
Jus' gimme the light
And pass the dro
Bust another bottle of moe
Gal dem in a me sight
And I gots know
Which one is gonna catch my flow
Causle I'm in a the vibes
And I got my dough
Bust another botte of moe
Girl dem lookin' hype
And I gots to know

Could I be your protector
Your buff in every sector
Everyman around dem
Want to turn your inspector
But you no let them sweat ya
No grill you with no lecture
But dem power drill
Or dem feul injector
Dem a infector
Disease collector
Nuff of dem a gon on
Like dem wan come wreck ya
Done out the part
Where you got in your center
But you know
You don't let them guy affect ya

[Chorus]

Five of them
Situation gettinh really live again
Girl dem want to Fi hang out with
The players and the riders de
Beside of them and dem say
Dem tired of the liars
Dem friars and connivers
Will never get inside of dem
Dem clyder dem
Especially the money hider dem
Watchie watchie girl bout dem
A try fi make bride of dem
Denied again
Some of them move like a spiderman
Girl dem say nah
Open wide again

[Chorus]
