Girl, girl, I'll be your sunshine, you can be mine
You'll be my wind chime, I've got the rhyme

You're so fine, for you I'd join the longest line

Medical and it's antidotal, oh yeah

Cause we a the top pro gal
International or local
Your man don't got it like me, none at all
Cause your man don't firm and you man don't tall

I'm a broke out the diamond and the opal
I'm a try buy love but now the love stall
Look like I'm don't have no hope at all

Hang 'em up like picture in na photo hall
Every man gwaan buy new protocol
S P, a di man you fi call
