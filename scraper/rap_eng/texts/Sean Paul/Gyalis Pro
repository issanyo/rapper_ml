[Intro: Sean Paul]

Cross dem off like a tic-tac-toe

Man a gyalis dem fi know (Gyalis pro)
Because, seed haffi sow, youth haffi grow
Whole heap a hot gyal we get outta road

[Verse 1: Alkaline]
Mi goodly fuck it already and you nuh know
How some man a say them a gyalis and anuh so?

Say she, ready fi anything wha' me say she fi do
Wha' me do? Give her the work, never know a fi you
Everybody get pussy, but everybody nuh pro

Anytime when touch street, a gyal must cheat
Tear sheet within the first week

She gimme top inna the front seat
Tell me all she waan from me is just a son, and then she complete
Me make she know, she haffi compete

Whole heap a hot gyal we get outta road
