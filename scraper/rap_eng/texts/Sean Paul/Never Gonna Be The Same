[Intro]
As the reality of the times take hold
We come to terms with the sadness we bear
Missing the times we never get to share
(woh-woh) (woh-woh) (woh-woh)
(woh-woh) (woh-woh)
Just a few words because we care
Still i got all the memorieees
(woh-woh) (woh-woh) (woh-woh) (woh-woh)

[Chorus]
Say, when mi look up inna mi life it's plain to see
That it's never gonna be the same
Take another step on towards my destiny
But the memories still remain
Deep inna mi brain, inna mi soul, I hold the key
Said, its never gonna be the same
Throughout all life and beyond all eternity
Yo we keep burnin up the flame

[Verse 1]
Wish I could rewind all the hands of time and bring back
Daddigon a great bredgin of mine, I....
Sit and remember all the things that we spoke of
All of the serious reasonings an all di tings we make jokes of
Still cannot believe them took your life away
But those who pull the trigger cannot take away
The covenant the righteous have with Jah Jah
So I know I'll see you again my brother. (what me think)

[Chorus]
Say, when mi look up inna mi life it's plain to see
That it's never gonna be the same
Take another step on towards my destiny
But the memories still remain
Deep inna mi brain, inna mi soul, I hold the key
Said, its never gonna be the same
Throughout all life and beyond all eternity
Yo we keep burnin up the flame

[Verse 2]
Fi all the friends and families that have past on
Leaving impressions and memories that will last on
We give thanks fi all the time that we know them
Reminisce them legacy that is what we owe them
Because the helped to make us who we are
So let us never forget and talk it near and far
Bless Up Grandpa Lee and Aunt Chris-I
Can't forget you if I try

[Chorus]
Say, when mi look up inna mi life it's plain to see
That it's never gonna be the same
Take another step on towards my destiny
But the memories still remain
Deep inna mi brain, inna mi soul, I hold the key
Said, its never gonna be the same
Throughout all life and beyond all eternity
Yo we keep burnin up the flame

[Bridge]

Simpleton (never gonna ever gonna be the same)
Peter Cargill (keep burnin up all the flame)
Shorty Malcolm (got memories inna mi brain)
Nicole Wynter (keep burnin up all the flame)
All friends and family....We'll never forget you all
(keep burning up the flame, the flame)
(Till JahJah link we again)

[Chorus]
Say, when mi look up inna mi life it's plain to see
That it's never gonna be the same
Take another step on towards my destiny
But the memories still remain
Deep inna mi brain, inna mi soul, I hold the key
Said, its never gonna be the same
Throughout all life and beyond all eternity
Yo we keep burnin up the flame

[Outro-Spoken]
For all the friends that have passed on before
We pray that you rest in peace
And Jah keep you safe until we meet again
