[Verse 1: Sean Paul]
So let me get inna the groove yaa girl

Ge- get you likkle loose yaa girl
Sips ciroc with the juice yaa girl
You no has no excuse yaa girl

[Pre-Chorus 1: Sean Paul]
A beautiful evening
I got you touching the ceiling
Loving the feeling
Ain't nothing stopping this
No, no, no
No, we got no fear
Ready fi tun it up no care
It's like we're billionaire
Ain't nothing stopping this
Go, go, go

[Chorus: Ellie Goulding]
The way you say it
Got me feeling like I'm faded
The way you do it
Got me wishing we were naked
You got that bad, bad love
And I just can't get enough
And I know my friends sayin', "girl, stay away"
But I like what I like
I, I eat that bad, bad love
I breathe that bad, bad love
I need your bad, bad
So take me away 'cause tonight is the night I...

[Refrain: Ellie Goulding & Sean Paul]
That bad love
Pure badness

Take me away 'cause tonight is the night I
That bad love
Pure badness
That bad
Take me away 'cause tonight is the night


[Verse 2: Sean Paul]

Sey mi god bless, you don' know what's next
Tear off di clothes and you don' know mad sex

[Pre-Chorus 2: Sean Paul]
Said, I'm gon' gear it up
Tear it up, make you delirious
Girl, if you serious

You got that bad, bad love
And I just can't get enough
And I know my friends sayin', "girl, stay away"
But I like what I like
