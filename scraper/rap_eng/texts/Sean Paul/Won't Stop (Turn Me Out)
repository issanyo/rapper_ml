What you feel like?
What you feel like?
What you feel like?
What you feel like?

Love her back because she love me
Picture up in my cell phone
Call her up when I get lonely
Hope she keeping her cell on
This girl, she got something about her I can't deny, aye
This girl, if she tells me to I'll be standing by, aye

But, what you don't know is
Once we get started, it will go on and on

And it won't stop till I see her love come down
And it won't stop till I'm in too deep I'll be lost in love
Nowhere to be found
And it won't stop till I hear her make that sound
Until she screaming out 'baby you're about to turn me out'
Oh no, we can't stop now

I'm about to feel her body
I'm about to feel her body
I'm about to feel her body
I'm about to feel her body

She'll be taking her clothes off
Once we get the gal right by me
Break her down till she doze off
This girl, should be up there with the stars in the sky, aye
This girl, she could send me on a permanent eye, aye
But what you don't know is
Once we get started it will go on and on

And it won't stop till I see her love come down
And it won't stop till I'm in too deep I'll be lost in love
Nowhere to be found
And it won't stop till I hear her make that sound
Until she screaming out 'baby you're about to turn me out'
Oh no, we can't stop now
Can't stop now
You're about to turn me out
You're about to turn
Watch your feet love

Talked up on this
Stepped up on this
Keep it real properly
No it ever means
You and I in twine
And in ever bliss
You and I combined
She a reminisce
Tops up on this
Give all the reminisce
See all the lonely nights
We got candy strips
I'm the landlord
To the premises
I am the king
Make her know
What a empress is
Jeanie me give you sex wishes
Flex with me
For the lifetime membership
So send her kids
Make remember this
No matter day from my calendar is

But what you don't know is
Once we get started it will go on and on

And it won't stop till I see her love come down
And it won't stop till I'm in too deep I'll be lost in love
Nowhere to be found
And it won't stop till I hear her make that sound
Until she screaming out 'baby you're about to turn me out'
Oh no, we can't stop now
Can't stop now
You're about to turn me out
You're, you're, you're about to turn
