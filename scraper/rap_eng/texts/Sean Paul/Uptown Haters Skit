[Chorus:]
Sometimes i hear you calling out my name
And i hear you deep down inna mi brain
If i'm a fool i've only got myself to blame, self to blame, self to blame
Well i can see the sign 'cause i'm not blind
Although you're not mine from time to time
I've got to let you know you are my sunshine, my sunshine, my sunshine

[Verse1:]
I love you baby but you don't love me back...Why
You drive me crazy 'cause yu fi gi mi dat...bly
You make me high! I just can't deny
Love out potential a fill up inna i and i
Just give me the privilege and run a way yu man
I got the plan! fi mek yu tun on
Baby just believe me 'cause my word is my bond!
Sometime i think i hear you but i am hearing wrong, girl!

[Chorus]

[Verse2:]
Rude bwoy loving a nu something fi she ramp wid
Everyman him need a woman fi be a live blanket
If she diss yu, spank it...you hold dat and crank it
Baby girl you know i love you but you follow yu friend dem
Now you gonna break Sean Paul heart in two
You have the dapper all a bawl and all a mek phone call

A lucky thing she never know where mi hide mi stash, but

Sometimes i hear you calling out my name
And i hear you deep down inna mi brain
If i'm a fool i've only got myself to blame, self to blame, self to blame....
