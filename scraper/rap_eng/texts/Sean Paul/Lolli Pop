La la la

Ooh, la la la la la la (ooh)

Boy, I'm ready
Come, come and get it
Sweet like honey
I know you want my treats
My treats
Come taste my lolli pop love
Boy, I'm ready
Come, come and get it
Sweet like honey
I know you want my treats
My treats
Come taste my lolli pop love

Come make a jump
Grabbing my bones
Gimme, boy
What I want
Let's take it slow
Don't move too fast
I want it, boy
Make it last
Tiptoes on my thighs
Really, boy
Look into my eyes
I'm your chocolate tree
In your candy land
I melt in your mouth
But not in your hand

Boy, I'm ready
Come, come and get it
Sweet like honey
I know you want my treats
My treats
Come taste my lolli pop love
Boy, I'm ready
Come, come and get it
Sweet like honey
I know you want my treats
My treats
Come taste my lolli pop love

I see you, boy
It's what I like
Ooh la la
It's on tonight
I'm your destiny
In between the sheets
An hour to live
It's your choice of treat
If you taste it once
You'll taste it twice
I've got a flavour
That I know you'll like
French vanilla
And strawberry surprise
Come quench your thirst
Or I'll leave you dry

Boy, I'm ready
Come, come and get it
Sweet like honey
I know you want my treats (my treats)
My treats (my treats)
Come taste my lolli pop love
Boy, I'm ready
Come, come and get it
Sweet like honey (oh)
I know you want my treats (oh)
My treats
Come taste my lolli pop love

Baby girl, you ready for this
Me whoop, you nah ish
When me deliver the sweet
Just gimme the time
Is you gon' like it
And me abide it
Make your move and
When they up inside it
Me go soft, hold tight
Baby girl
Now let me go
Me, I'm gon' unleash the freak
Inside you now
We're there working
Working slow from me
Don't make you lose control

Boy, I'm ready
Come, come and get it
Sweet like honey
I know you want my treats
My treats
Come taste my lolli pop love
Boy, I'm ready
Come, come and get it
Sweet like honey
I know you want my treats
My treats
Come taste my lolli pop love
