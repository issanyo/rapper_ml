[Intro: Anne-Marie]
Rockabye, baby
Rockabye, baby
Rockabye, baby
Rockabye, baby

[Verse 1: Anne-Marie]
She works at nights, by the water
She's gone astray, so far away
From her father's daughter
She just wants a life for her baby
All on her own, no one will come
She's got to save him

[Pre-Chorus 1: Anne-Marie]
She tells him, "Oh, love, no one's ever gonna hurt you, love."
"I'm gonna give you all of my love."
"Nobody matters like you."
She tells him, "Your life ain't gon' be nothing like my life."
"You're gonna grow and have a good life."
"I'm gonna do what I've got to do."

[Chorus: Anne-Marie]
So, rockabye, baby, rockabye
I'm gonna rock you
Rockabye, baby, don't you cry
Somebody's got you
Rockabye, baby, rockabye
I'm gonna rock you
Rockabye, baby, don't you cry
Ah, Rockabye, no
Rockabye

[Verse 2: Sean Paul & Anne-Marie]
Single mum, how're you doing out there?
Facing the hard life, without no fear (Yeah!)
Just so you know that you really care
'Cause any obstacle come, you're well prepared (Oh, no!)
And no, mama, you never shed tear
'Cause you have to shed things year after year
And you give the yout love beyond compare (Yeah!)
You find his school fee and the bus fare (Yeah!)
Mh, Marie, the paps' disappear
In the wrong bar, can't find him nowhere
Steadily your workflow, heavily you know
So your non-stop, no time, no time for ya dear

[Pre-Chorus 2: Anne-Marie]
When she says, "Oh, love, no one's ever gonna hurt you, love."
"I'm gonna give you all of my love."
"Nobody matters like you."

[Chorus: Anne-Marie & Sean Paul]
So, rockabye, baby, rockabye
I'm gonna rock you
Rockabye, baby, don't you cry
Somebody's got you
Rockabye, baby, rockabye
I'm gonna rock you
Rockabye, baby, don't you cry
(Badda-bang-bang-bang, alright then)
Rockabye
Rockabye

[Outro: Anne-Marie]
Rockabye, baby
Rockabye, baby
Rockabye, baby
