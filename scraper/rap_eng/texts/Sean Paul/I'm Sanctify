Bless the man, there ain't no stress
You done know God bless with the positiveness
They say many more suffer and die
But hold your head up high
Jah know, Jah know, Jah know
Keep on the track
Troyton touch the sky!
Open up your third eye
Hey

Light up the chalice, give thanks fi life
And me know the devil cyaan win
