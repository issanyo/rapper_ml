But It's Far Away From Here
Said I'm Filling Up My Tank, Adjust My Radio
Got My Dollars In My Pocket Put Ever The Wind Blows
Now Go, Just Go, I'm Ready, I'm Ready

In My Rear View Mirror
I Don't See Nothing Once More
Everything's Much Clearer And
I Push That Metal Into The Floor
I Gotta Go, Go, Oho, Oho, Uh
I Gotta Go, Go, Oho, Oho, Uh

Not a Care In The World Rolling Dolu In My Ride
And Even Though I'm All Alone
Feels Like I'm Flowing On Cloud Night
See I'm Stepping On The Gas And Gonna Press Rewind
All The Things That Held Me Back
I'm Leaving Them All Behind
I'm Sure I Want More, I'm Ready
I'm Looking, Looking In The

In My Rear View Mirror
I Don't See Nothing Once More
Everything's Much Clearer And
I Push That Metal Into The Floor
I Gotta Go, Go, Oho, Oho, Uh
I Gotta Go, Go, Oho, Oho, Uh

Because You Never Did Listen And You Never Did Talk
Never Did Consider The Woman Now She Walk

In My Rear View Mirror
I Don't See Nothing Once More
Everything's Much Clearer And
I Push That Metal Into The Floor
I Gotta Go, Go, Oho, Oho, Uh
I Gotta Go, Go, Oho, Oho, Uh
