Soldiers of jah army
Represent
Haters they try to harm me
Their words they only calm me
Repent yo sins
Go to church
Get so high
You never gonna die

Yo soul lives on

If pray to the heavens
My brother yo work is done

Soulja boy be in my kitchen
Ain't no other room he fit in

[A-starr]
Yo hate for that boy ain't healthy
Imma do some missionary shit so stealthy
You be loving him
And hugging him
Before the week is done
