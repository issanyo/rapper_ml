[Intro: Sean Paul & Quavo]
S to the P
Ayy, ayy
Don Carleon
Migos and Sean Paul in the buildin'
Mally Mall
And you know we smoke blunts to the face
Because
Everybody sayin' up, up away

[Chorus: Sean Paul & Quavo]
My girl, cause the body weh yuh got worth more than 'bout a billion
Ayy, ayy
Just wanna feel ya
Ayy, ayy
And get familiar, ayy
The body weh yuh got worth more than 'bout a trillion
I just wanna feel ya
Oh

[Verse 1: Offset]
(Offset!)
She gorgeous, I'ma pay her mortgage (gorgeous, mortgage)
I'ma buy you Christian Louboutin you can't afford it (Louboutin)
Take you on a trip 'cause I know that your nigga borin' (borin')
Christian Dior scrapin' on the floor when we boardin' (we boardin')
Her booty roll and she go slow motion, I stroke it (woah)
There's somethin' 'bout you, you know you special, you golden (special)
Smoking gas like I’m Willy Nelson in Belgium (gas)
Like the handyman with the hammer, I nailed it (ayy)
Come and ride with a G, fly than a feather (ride)
Hit it from the back, I'm bussin' like Barettas (nah)
Pulled up in my Lamborghini when I met her (skrrt)
You nigga kept on cheatin' and I know you fed up (woah)
If you wanna keep your lady, better keep your bread up (cash)
I had her in my mansion, told her put her leg up (smash)
Paid the bill, wrapped her in Chanel from her head up (Chanel)
Girl, you're just like an angel, did you come from heaven?

[Bridge: Sean Paul]
You keep it hot with your body, hot with your clothes
Love how yuh tan up and a give me di pose
Hot, hot with your body, hot with your clothes
Love how yuh tan up and a give me di pose
Like girl, mek mi tek yuh pon an evening cruise
Tell yuh seh yuh just cyaah lose
Giddy up, giddy up
Baby girl, don't get confused

[Chorus: Sean Paul & Quavo]
Because di body weh yuh got worth more than 'bout a billion

And get familiar, ayy
Di body weh yuh got worth more than 'bout a trillion
I just wanna feel ya
Yeah, yeah
I wanna steal ya, girl

[Verse 2: Takeoff]
The way that you're talkin', I figured, girl, you look familiar (huh?)
Live in luxury, babe, we not regular civilians
I'm a superhero, but once a villain, wanting the millions
Got them notice every time that we in the buildin' (ayy)
Walkin' in with them Balmains, out in the sun
And I fathered all you niggas 'cause rappers, y'all my sons
Don't care that if they catchin' you, you gon' be number one
Came from the bum, servin' crumb, fuckin' bitches stallions

[Verse 3: Quavo]
Ayy, ayy
Hundreds of bottles and beautiful models (hunnids)
I wanna sing to her, Quavo Sinatra (brrr)
She know that I'm young but she lovin' my posture (ayy)
She told me get rid of my chicks on my roster (woo)
Okay, okay, okay (okay)
It's cool, girl, whatever you say (whatever you say)
She catch a body 'cause she have a AK (rah, rah, rah)
She catch a body 'cause she have a AK (pop, pop)
And she won't sell work
She gon' ride against the world 'cause that's my girl (skrrt)
Céline bag was her dream bag (dream)
When she woke up in the mornin', let her seen that

[Bridge: Sean Paul]
Hot with your body, hot with your clothes
Love how yuh tan up and a give me di pose
Hot, hot with your body, hot with your clothes
Love how yuh tan up and a give me di pose
Like girl, mek mi tek yuh pon an evening cruise
Tell yuh seh yuh just cyaah lose
Giddy up, giddy up
Baby girl, don't get confused

[Chorus: Sean Paul & Quavo]
Because di body weh yuh got worth more than 'bout a billion
Ayy, ayy

Ayy, ayy
And get familiar, ayy
Di body weh yuh got worth more than 'bout a trillion
