[Verse 1: Busta Rhymes]
Ok, you know you're supposed to know
You know how we do it
You know how it's 'posed to go
Don't stray
We come and we puttin' it on 'em
Rosé
Stay approach you with fireworks on 'em
You don't say?
And I hear that they' doin' it big
All day
Pop a bottle then take me a swig
Dolcé
Gabbana be lacin' my crib
[?]
Style, cook it be lacin' my ribs
And portray
An image that's great for the kids
My forté
Is grindin' and makin' them hits
Foreplay
With my mike when I'm bangin a chick
All gray
See the way that it lay on my wrist
Those pay
When they try to go 'gainst my click
Out in Vegas
At the Mandalay
With Mayweather
Handelin'
A lot of money make your day better
Carryin'

[Chorus: Sean Paul]
Cognac is in me cup and now me feel alright
Got me spliff rolled up and now me day is right
Dem cyah follow back ah we tonight
Dem can't come fuck wit we tonight
Cognac is in me cup and now me feel alright
Got me spliff rolled up and now me day is right
Dem cyah follow back ah we tonight
Dem can't come fuck wit we tonight

[Verse 2: Busta Rhymes]
Check, Check
See the microphone Don is back
Expect
Me to make 'em catch cardiacs
Respect
When I sip on my Cogn-y-ac
I make your chick wet
And wanna know where the party at
Except
She already know all of that
Quick prep
Only chicks allowed, sorry black
My trinkets
Gotta dangle and fall on my lap
Blistex
For the bands a little unbuckle my strap
Chin check
You know my handle I'm ready to scrap
Shipwreck
For any vandal, I stay wit' a Gat
But let us keep it goin'
While our heaters is blowin'
Bitch get
Another bottle and bring it on back
Cause you fish-net
And the rest of your friends
Which meant
We by the door of the club and we ready
For travelin' chicks
Under my arm with the bottles I'm carryin'

[Chorus: Sean Paul]
Cognac is in me cup and now me feel alright
Got me spliff rolled up and now me day is right
Dem cyah follow back ah we tonight
Dem can't come fuck wit we tonight
Cognac is in me cup and now me feel alright
Got me spliff rolled up and now me day is right
Dem cyah follow back ah we tonight
Dem can't come fuck wit we tonight
