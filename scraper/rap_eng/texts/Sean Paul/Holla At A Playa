See she fast asleep with her hands on my balls
I'm searching on the floor didn't see no rubber package
Now I'm screamin' like AHHHHHH, what the hell did I do?
Man girl don't tell nobody about this shit here
In fact, don't even speak when I see you

I say, hey, you, need to holla at these boys
These boys called Jim Crow (in the A - Town)
Fuckin' niggas know worldwide
With a car full of helpers inside
Then they came like a thief in the night (in the night)
Don't know why niggas actin' surprised (betta' holla now)
We gone in the blink of an eye
So ya betta' holla cause we don't say bye
