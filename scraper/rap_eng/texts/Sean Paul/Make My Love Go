[Intro: Sean Paul]
Aye
It's Sean Paul 'long side
The mandem called Jay Sean
Fi di gal dem
Tellin' 'em again what we tell 'em

[Verse 1: Jay Sean]
Pass me a drink to the left, yeah
Said her name was Delilah
And I'm like, "you should come my way"
I already surrender
Damn girl that body's fire
You gon' remember my name
(She should give it up, definite)

[Pre-Chorus: Jay Sean]
You need it
I need it
We can jump in the deep end
I wanna get lost in your love

[Chorus: Jay Sean]
I just wanna be close to you
(Just wanna, I just wanna)
And do all the things you want me to
I just wanna be close to you
(I just wanna, I just wanna)
And show you the way I feel
You make my love go...
You make my love go...
You make my love go...

[Verse 2: Jay Sean]
In the morning we gon' do it again, wake up
I'mma do it like we just broke up and made up
Get up on top of me and work up a sweat, work up a sweat
See we can, do it any type of way that you want
I'm thinking maybe you're the right kind of wrong
I'm saying baby you won't ever forget my love

[Pre-Chorus: Jay Sean]
You need it
I need it
We can jump in the deep end
I wanna get lost in your love

[Chorus: Jay Sean]
I just wanna be close to you
(Just wanna, I just wanna)
And do all the things you want me to
I just wanna be close to you
(I just wanna, I just wanna)
And show you the way I feel
You make my love go...
You make my love go...
You make my love go...

[Verse 3: Sean Paul]

[Chorus: Jay Sean]

And show you the way I feel

You make my love go...
You make my love go...
