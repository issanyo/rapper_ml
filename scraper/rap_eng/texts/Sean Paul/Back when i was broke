Back when I was broke nobody gave a fuck
Now that I got bands everybody hit me up
Told them I would make it, they didn't believe it
Sorry you missed out, now I’m living what I'm dreaming
Back when I was broke nobody gave a fuck
Now that I got bands everybody hit me up
Told them I would make it, they didn't believe it
Sorry you missed out, now I’m living what I'm dreaming

[Verse 1]
I tried to tell them, they ain't listen to the kid
Now they jealous, tryna knock me off my shit
Where were you, when I was trying to make a move
Man I knew I had the juice, I ain't never go to school
'Cause I knew that if I believed in myself
That I could make all my dreams turn to wealth
It's too late now, I don’t need your loving
I don’t need support from these niggas, they ain't nothin'
It's too late now, it's too late now
How you tryna show me love, you is fake now
'Cause you ain't never show me nothing back then
Now I got M’s in my bank account, we not friends

[Chorus]
Back when I was broke nobody gave a fuck
Now that I got bands everybody hit me up
Told them I would make it, they didn't believe it
Sorry you missed out, now I’m living what I'm dreaming
Back when I was broke nobody gave a fuck
Now that I got bands everybody hit me up
Told them I would make it, they didn't believe it
Sorry you missed out, now I’m living what I'm dreaming

[Verse 2]
Now they mad, yeah I know
'Cause they never thought that I would make it here
Now I made more money than my teachers in a year
And I got more money than them niggas over there
I was homeless as a kid, now I'm living everywhere
I ain't nothing like these niggas, they ain't working as hard as me
And I took care of the fam, took 'em out of poverty
And I always knew they hatin', but it never got to me
'Cause I knew, that I would make it
And I knew, that I'd be famous
Yeah I knew, that I would make it
And now you mad, sitting there hatin'

[Chorus]
Back when I was broke nobody gave a fuck
Now that I got bands everybody hit me up
Told them I would make it, they didn't believe it
Sorry you missed out, now I’m living what I'm dreaming
Back when I was broke nobody gave a fuck
Now that I got bands everybody hit me up
Told them I would make it, they didn't believe it
Sorry you missed out, now I’m living what I'm dreaming
