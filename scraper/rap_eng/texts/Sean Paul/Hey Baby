Rookie Up On The Latter

[Hook]
Hey baby trinna find what you driving' me crazy
All these other pretty girls don't faze me
I'm shy but you makin' me hazy
Hey baby hey baby
It's the way but you're making  up to me
Tell me you ain't got a man like too me
Let's stands like you already knew me
Hey baby

[Verse 1]
Soon as I step up on the room, yeah
Unless I was like you, yeah
You know what I wanna do
Hey baby
Actin' like I never knew
You're looking brand new
All eyes on you
Hey baby
I wanna break you outta box
So when the beat drops
You'd know what to do, just see me
If I play my cards right
Weâ€™ll be leaving tonight, just us two

Let's take a interlude
Tell your friend you're back in 2
Hey baby
Hands moving on your waistline
Andd I don't wanna waste time
Tell me that it's mine hey baby

Girl don't let be the last time
