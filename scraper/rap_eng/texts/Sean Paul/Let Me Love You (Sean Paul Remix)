DJ Snake, Sean-da-Paul a go make them know

[Verse 1: Sean Paul]
Baby girl, everything up to date, up to date, up to date
So me made no mistake, no mistake, no mistake
Ain't just alcohol talking
Our love is from morning
Ain't no debate, no debate, no debate

I will always show you the deepest flow
Give you all that I got to give, babygirl
Cuh you're all that I got to live for, live for
Lifetime and me done see the sign
You're mine two a we a combine
Rewind to da very first time

No, no, coulda never get enough
Need more of your kisses and touch

[Breakdown: DJ Snake]

[Verse 2: Justin Bieber]
Don't fall asleep
At the wheel, we've got a million miles ahead of us
Miles ahead of us
All that we need
Is a rude awakening to know we're good enough yeah
Know we're good enough

[Bridge: Justin Bieber]
Say go through the darkest of days
Heaven's a heartbreak away
Never let you go, never let me down
Oh it's been a hell of a ride
Driving the edge of a knife
Never let you go, never let me down

[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
Don't you give up, nah-nah-nah
I won't give up, nah-nah-nah
Let me love you
Let me love you
Don't you give up, nah-nah-nah
I won't give up, nah-nah-nah
Let me love you
Let me love you
Oh baby, baby

[Breakdown: DJ Snake]

[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
Don't you give up, nah-nah-nah
I won't give up, nah-nah-nah
Let me love you
Let me love you
Don't you give up, nah-nah-nah
I won't give up, nah-nah-nah
Let me love you
Let me love you
Oh baby, baby
