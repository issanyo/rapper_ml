[Intro: Stefflon Don & Sean Paul]
(Banx & Ranx)
I take the shot and wine, wine, wine
(I wine, wine)
Hennessy shot and wine, wine, wine
(I wine, wine)
No need fi rush, take time, time, time
(Take time, time)
I take a shot and wine, wine
I take a shot and wine, wine

[Verse 1: Sean Paul]
Gyal, buss split fi me, dip fi mi
Baby girl, I want you flip fi mi
Come on back and roll hip fi mi
Mek mi know, seh that you into me
Takin' it slow and intimate
Your intellect so roots and immaculate
Can't forget all your shape and sexy legs
Baby girl, me a beg, yeah, yuh nah mek me beg
When you do the ting, you mash up mi head
Just imaginin' you movin' it in di bed
Keep mi alive an' nah make mi dead
Then she look inna mi face and said

[Chorus: Stefflon Don]
I take the shot and wine, wine, wine

Send it up, up inna mi right

Ain't nobody have to know (Bidi bang bang bang)

[Chorus: Stefflon Don]
I take the shot and wine, wine, wine
