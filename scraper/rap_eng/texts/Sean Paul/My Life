Can we do this every day?
Make the sound turn up loud
Make the music play?
Make the sun energy ..here by the kiss

Chorus:
You see the party won't stop 'till the morning light
Smoking, cash to fly
Don't stay up in the club tonight
And this how this is how I'm gonna live my life
Your hands in the air like sha, la, la, la, la
In the Lambo switching lanes like da, da, da, da
Swag is up, your lame like ta, na, na, na
Stay place every day like aha, ha, ha
..superstar
I see you in CPR
We gonna buy a drink, no buy the bar
And everybody don't know who we are
We caught 'em flipping up, flipping
Tear up blouse and flipping skirts
..massage and a room with thee
The place would be
Them, never hard
Sit, sitting them,..

Chorus:
You see the party won't stop 'till the morning light
Smoking, cash to fly
Don't stay up in the club tonight
And this how this is how I'm gonna live my life
Your hands in the air like sha, la, la, la, la
In the Lambo switching lanes like da, da, da, da
Swag is up, your lame like ta, na, na, na
Stay place every day like aha, ha, ha
..like a wide receiver
We are not to..
We smoked ..like Wiz Khalifa
We get sky high with
We stay blunted best believe
..with models and bottles in the VIP
And we do this every day
When the sun turn to..
And the music play
Make.energy 

Chorus:
You see the party won't stop 'till the morning light
Smoking, cash to fly
Don't stay up in the club tonight
And this how this is how I'm gonna live my life
Your hands in the air like sha, la, la, la, la
In the Lambo switching lanes like da, da, da, da
Swag is up, your lame like ta, na, na, na
Stay place every day like aha, ha, ha
