Woman, get busy, just shake that booty non-stop
When the beat drop, just keep swinging it
Get jiggy, get crunked up
Percolate anything you want to call it
Oscillate you hip and don't take pity
Me want fi see you get live 'pon the riddim when me ride
And me lyrics a provide electricity
Gyal nobody can't tell you nuttin'
Caw you done know your destiny
