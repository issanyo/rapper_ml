Cah baby girl i see the way you move
Take you back to my room
So we can catch a little groove
You know dat i've been watchin'
You been singin' my tunes
And right now nothing stoppin'
Keep it poppin' me and you
And right now nothing stoppin'
Keep it poppin' me and you
And right now nothing stoppin'
Keep it poppin' me and you
And right now nothing stoppin'
Keep it poppin' me and you
