[Intro]
Just gimme di trees and mek we smoke it yow

We nuh need nuh speed so we nah nuh coke it yow

So when yuh see di S.P. floatin' don't provoke him
Cau di weed weh we smokin need fi soakin
Best ting fi di meditation, and di best hygrade a Jamaican
When we a bun a weed we supportin and promotin
Low di crack and di coke ting yeah we soakin'

Legalize it right now we gwaan blaze one

[Chorus]
Everyday, we be burnin' not concernin' what nobody wanna say
We be earnin' dollars turning cah' we mind de pon we pay
Some got gold and oil and diamonds all we got is Mary J
Legalize it, time you recognize it

[Verse 2]
This purple haze it mek me crazy
Mek me write nuff tune and dat's what pays me
But it's dat not di only occupation
Going to get some, I give yuh education
When a farmer grows it he knows to close it
Econimical benefit help fi those who a fi deh yah pon di hard jugglin'
Cau di system only keep man strugglin'
Studyin people a use it dont abuse it

And it found on di grave of King Solomon
And it good fi di eye sight and di chest sight
And it give yuh nuff inside just gimme di light
And, mek we blaze it we should a neva waste it
