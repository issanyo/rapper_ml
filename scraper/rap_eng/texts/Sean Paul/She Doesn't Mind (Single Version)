[Intro: Sean Paul]
Ouuh
Girl I got you so high, and I know you like
So come and push it on me, if it feels alright
When you drop it low, and break me off
No, she doesn't mind (aight)
She doesn't mind (aight)
She doesn't mind
Girl I got you so!

[Verse 1: Sean Paul]
Push it back pon it, bring it back pon it
Gimme di ting becah mi waah fi lock pon it
Wine it, wiggle it, set di track pon it
Two more shot, now we inna hot pon it
Two girl, and dem ready fi jump pon it
Two to my world, and mi ready fi tump pon it
Ready fi run pon it, ready fi dump pon it
Tag teaming fiyah truck mi pump on it

[Pre-Chorus: Sean Paul]
Hands up high, we burning up the sky
We got the dance all crazy, got the club on fire
I like the way you dance, you got me in a trance
My baby she don't mind at all...

[Chorus: Sean Paul]
Girl I got you so high, and I know you like
So come and push it on me, if it feels alright
When you drop it low, and break me off

So come and push it on me, if it feels alright
When you drop it low, and break me off

[Bridge: Sean Paul]
Ain't gonna be shy about it
Ain't telling no lie

I want you to come for the ride
Let's win it out, win it out
Win it out, win it out...
Let's go!
