The way you move it
Move that body girl

[Verse 1]
I like your big booty
Keep push-pushing it on me, I can't deny it
Now we at the rodeo, gi-gi-di-up and ride it
I'm a whine my body on you
Just the way you like it
When you put it on me
Baby girl you get me excited

[Pre- Chorus]
Oooh you got a sweet tooth
Come get you some of this candy
Sit and talking at the bar is only gonna bore me
You sexy girl, are you single?
Maybe later we can mingle
You sexy girl, are you single?
But right now

[Chorus]
I came to dance, I came to dance
I got them boys on my heels, make 'em run,run,run
I got them girls feeling like they wanna get get some
I came to dance
Move that body girl, move that body girl, move that body
I came to dance
Move that body girl, move that body girl, move that body
I got them boys on my heels, make 'em run,run,run
I got them girls feeling like they wanna get get some

[Verse 2]
I like your hot body, let's go shorty
You're getting me ignited
My hip bone connect to my collar bone, so bye (Come on girl)
You think that you're going to get away from me girl, don't you fight it
Whine up your body girl, cause that's how I like it

[Pre- Chorus]
Oooh you got a sweet tooth
Come get you some of this candy
Sit and talking at the bar is only gonna bore me
You sexy girl, are you single?
Maybe later we can mingle
You sexy girl, are you single?
But right now

[Chorus]
I came to dance, I came to dance
I got them boys on my heels, make 'em run,run,run
I got them girls feeling like they wanna get get some
I came to dance, I came to dance
I got them boys on my heels, make 'em run,run,run
I got them girls feeling like they wanna get get some

[Verse 3]
Bda,bang,bang,bang
Can you feel me knocking girl?
Just open the door
Got you ready for the perfect evening, so what you waiting for?
I'm little busy trying to live on the floor
Well you should get busy with me and settle the score

[Chorus]
I came to dance,I came to dance [do it girl]
I got them boys on my heels, make 'em run,run,run
I got them girls feeling like they wanna get get some
I came to dance, I came to dance
Move that body girl, move that body girl, move that body
Got them girls feeling like they wanna get -get some
I came to dance, dance da -a- da - dance

[Outro]
Let me see you shake it girl,until you break it
Let me see you shake it girl, until you break it
I got them boys on my heels, make 'em run,run,run
And I've got them girls feeling like they wanna get - get some
