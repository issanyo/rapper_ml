[Verse 1: Anne-Marie]
She works the nights, by the water
She's gone astray, so far away
From her father's daughter
She just wants a life for her baby
All on her own, no one will come
She's got to save him

[Pre-Chorus 1: Anne-Marie]
She tells him, "Oh, love, no one's ever gonna hurt you, love
I'm gonna give you all of my love
Nobody matters like you"

She tells him, "Your life ain't gonna be nothing like my life
You're gonna grow and have a good life
I'm gonna do what I've got to do"

[Chorus 1: Anne-Marie & (Sean Paul)]
So, rockabye baby, rockabye
I'm gonna rock you
Rockabye baby, don't you cry
(Stay out there, stay out there)
Somebody's got you
Rockabye baby, rockabye
I'm gonna rock you
Rockabye baby, don't you cry
(Stay out there, stay out there)
Rockabye

[Drop 1: Anne-Marie & (Sean Paul)]
No, oh, rockabye
Yeah, yeah
No, oh, rockabye
(Rockabye-rocka-rocka-rocka-bye)
Yeah, yeah
(Rockabye-rocka-rocka-rocka-bye)

[Verse 2: Sean Paul & (Anne-Marie); Together]
Single mom, how you doing out there?
Facing the hard life, without no fear (Yeah)
Just so you know that you really care
'Cause any obstacle come you’re well prepared (Oh no)
And no mama, you never shed tear
'Cause you have to shed things year after year (Oh, nah, nah, nah)
And you give the youth love beyond compare (Yeah)
You find his school fee and the bus fare
Mmm already paps' disappear
In the wrong bar can’t find him nowhere
Steadily you work flow, everything you know
So you're non-stop, no time, no time for you dear

[Bridge: Anne-Marie]
Now she got a six-year-old
Trying to keep him warm
Trying to keep out the cold
When he looks in her eyes
He gon' know he is safe when she says

[Pre-Chorus 2: Anne-Marie]
"Oh, love, no one's ever gonna hurt you, love
I'm gonna give you all of my love
Nobody matters like you"

[Chorus 2: Anne-Marie]
So, rockabye baby, rockabye
I'm gonna rock you
Rockabye baby, don't you cry
Somebody's got you
Rockabye baby, rockabye
I'm gonna rock you
Rockabye baby, don't you cry
Rockabye

[Drop 2: Anne-Marie]
No, oh, rockabye
Yeah, yeah
Oh, yeah

[Chorus 3: Anne-Marie]
So, rockabye baby, rockabye
I'm gonna rock you
Rockabye baby, don't you cry (rockabye)
Somebody's got you (yeah, yeah, oh)
Rockabye baby, rockabye (rockabye, no)
I'm gonna rock you (oh)
Rockabye baby, don't you cry (rockabye)
Rockabye
