[Intro: Gentleman & Sean Paul]
Can't go half-hearted so I went all-in
Thumbs up or down and everybody's talking
Some will love yuh, some will hate yuh
But you cyah be everyone's darling
Cyah guh half-hearted, suh I went all-in
Thumbs up or down and everyone's talking
Some will love yuh, some will hate yuh
But you cyah be everyone's darling, check it

[Verse 1: Gentleman]
Cards on the table, take it or leave, but I don't give a damn
Say what you wanna say but I know you cyah derail the plan
Nuh compromise cah life is too short, cyah wait until tomorrow
Enjoy my life, I ain't got nuh time to drown inside nuh sorrow

[Pre-Hook: Gentleman & Sean Paul]
I see the future's bright and pretty
After the rain and storm is over
And it's bright like lights in the city
Ready fi bus like soupanova
We got the heart of a lion, not a kitty
Fearless we nuh run fi cover
And we not turn back, we are comitted
Going full speed and wi nah pull over

[Hook: Gentleman & Sean Paul]
Nah pull over, nah pull over
You and yuh negativity fi guh overboard
You too badmind, that mi discover
Yuh narrow mind deh pon ovaload
Wi nah pull over, nah pull over
You and yuh negativity fi guh overboard
You too badmind, that mi discover
Yuh narrow mind deh pon ovaload

[Verse 2: Gentleman]
If I would try to please everyone and fit in every gang
I wouldn't be me at all, no
Follow the root and rising of the sun and surprising
Everyone, yes, I will follow di call, yeah
None of the critics and praises, no poker faces
No, you couldn't build me nuh wall, no
I take the bricks and the stones, I build a bridge and a road
And mi nuh follow nuh protocol

[Verse 3: Sean Paul]
Suh do yuh thing, do yuh thing, do yuh thing
Gotta be yuh owna king, gotta be yuh owna king
Never let anything mek yuh stop progressing
Never let negative stop you from winning
Obstacles inna yuh way, just face it
Don't bother make dem block yuh from the basics
From yuh see yuh dream, just get up and chase it
From yuh got life, then yuh must embrace it

[Pre-Hook: Gentleman & Sean Paul
