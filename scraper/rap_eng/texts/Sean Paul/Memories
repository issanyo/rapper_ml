I need all my believers that are listening to what I'm saying right now
If it had not been for love
Everything that is in this world would not exist
We need to understand right now that because of love
Things happen in a way where people just don't seem to understand
Love is something that does not
Does not compromise itself
Love is something
That we'll sacrifice For everything that goes on
If you believe
I need you to believe in love right now
Raise your hands up high Feel the love generation Cover the world with love, come on
