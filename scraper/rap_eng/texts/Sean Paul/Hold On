[Chorus]
Hold on to the dream
Hold on, hold on now, now
Hold on and believe
That we're already one, we still hold on
Hold on, hold on now, now
We still hold on
Hold on, hold on now, now
Hold on to the dream

[Verse 1]
It is done, I'll see you there
I know you're well prepared
Put aside all your fears
Jah will answer all your prayers
My team that no one cares
Been working hard for years
Keep climbing up the stairs
Gotta know that you are ready there
Blood, sweat and the tears now
None of them can take your shares now
Enemies better be aware now
Champions got a lot to bare now
I'ma tell you this I'ma swear now
I are the tiger I got the stair now
Carry on until we see the sun
We're holding on

[Chorus]
Hold on to the dream
Hold on, hold on now, now
Hold on and believe
That we're already one, we still hold on
Hold on, hold on now, now
We still hold on
Hold on, hold on now, now
Hold on to the dream

[Post-Chorus]
Although the road is long
We still hold on
We carry on
We still stay strong
Today is long
But tomorrow will come
Hold on, hold on now now

[Verse 2]
All the broke guys know be the strongest peeps
All that you know seh the road is steep
Pain and trouble and try a long grief
But yuh must soak cah yuh must worry
Hard times never will get you beat
And you never will get defeat
From your old and strong concrete
Do the work, 'cause talk is cheap

[Chorus]
Hold on to the dream
Hold on, hold on now, now
Hold on and believe
That we're already one, we still hold on
Hold on, hold on now, now
We still hold on
Hold on, hold on now, now
Hold on to the dream

[Post-Chorus]
Although the road is long
We still hold on
We carry on
We still stay strong
Today is long
But tomorrow will come
Hold on, hold on now now

[Bridge]
Oho, oho, oho, oho
Hold on

[Chorus]
Hold on to the dream
Hold on, hold on now, now
Hold on and believe
That we're already one, we still hold on
Hold on, hold on now, now
We still hold on
Hold on, hold on now, now
Hold on to the dream

[Post-Chorus]
Although the road is long
We still hold on
We carry on
We still stay strong
Today is long
But tomorrow will come
Hold on, hold on now now
