Well I been a lot a places, an a seen a lot a faces
An I gotta lot a ladies on a regular, regular basis
An I deal off wit dem cases, an I move it out and chase it
So young girl a nuff fi know, yo

[Chorus]
A one ting me tell nuh go make nuh man tell yuh nuh samfi
Dutty get yuh body, 'nough a dem a go lie
Has to give em a chancehas a give em a bligh
Den dem say a me fly, me go so
One ting me tell dem nuh make nuh man mill a nuh take care
Nuff a dem a pimp say outta there
Nuff a dem gonna heart an nuffa dem dont care
Listen an di way I am

Yo when dem is life
When never woman want to be di wife
Dem running around a look pon every man inna dem sight
Dyna-Mic strike
When dem find dey wonder whey dem like
Carefull what ya buck up him a cut ya like a knife
Cuz a man will be what a man gotta be
If yuh look you will see
Theres nuff fi yuh key
Onnu fi listen to di lyrics comin from Sean da P
Who dey want to be in up yuh life like a lickle maintain

Woman a one ting me tell nuh go make nuh man tell yuh nuh samfi
Dutty get yuh body
Nuff a dem a go lie
Has to give em a chance
Has a give em a bligh
Den dem say a me fly
Me go so
One ting me tell dem nuh make nuh man mill a nuh take care
Nuff a dem a pimp say outta there
Nuff a dem gonna heart an nuffa dem dont care
Listen an di way I am

Just let me tease it
Dem me get yuh stress so yuh nuh need it
Threat di cheezy
Nuff a dem hav dem youth dem waan fi feel it
Expend dem on, yuh pon di alcohol an pon di beenies
So nuh get dem no punaani, if dem move it too greedy
Remember what yuh momma tell, remember what yuh poppa said
Carefull a di youth, dey wha you waan fi care ina yuh bed..
Dem coulda brag a back, it tell yuh bout di bigger neffi let
But yuh know yuh want di money instead

[Chorus]
Well I been a lot a places, an a seen a lot a faces
An I gotta lot a ladies on a regular, regular basis
An I deal off wit dem cases, an I move it out and chase it
So young girl a nuff fi know, yo

[Chorus: x2]
