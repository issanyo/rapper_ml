[Verse 1: Jhené Aiko]
You kept me waiting but I was patient
Now your my favourite
Wasn't that hard to choose
Sex so amazing, I can't replace it
Don't wanna waste it

[Chorus 1: Jhené Aiko]
I wanna call you up sometimes
Whenever you cross my mind
When I go back in time good love's hard to find
I know you remember when we used to be more than friends
I know that was way back when
But can we fuck again?

[Chorus 2: Sean Paul]
Girl, I don't wanna talk too much
I just wanna see your naked truth
Girl, I don't wanna talk too much
I just wanna see your naked truth

[Pre-Chorus: Sean Paul]
Ain't no secret, you can keep
When i give it good to you
You want me and I want you
And that's the naked truth

[Verse 2: Sean Paul]
Well, alright then
My girl, it's a while, long time
Say mi ready fi buss like it's lind aah mild
My style weh mi call it lion pride
See my love girl it's Ionize
Tha-that's right, that's right
Giving you all night the longest ride
My girl a the strongest kind
Keep you floating river Nile
Girl the naked truth is
Need one night fi just handle mi bizz
The naked truth is

[Chorus 1: Jhené Aiko]
I wanna call you up sometimes
Whenever you cross my mind
When I go back in time, good love's hard to find
I know you remember when we used to be more than friends
I know that was way back when
But can we fuck again?

[Chorus 2: Sean Paul]
Girl, I don't wanna talk too much
I just wanna see your naked truth
Girl, I don't wanna talk too much
I just wanna see your naked truth

[Pre-Chorus: Sean Paul]
Ain't no secret, you can keep

And there ain't no stalling, stalling

You never get no bubble-ing
