[Intro]
Boys and girls [?] of the nation
Naturally calm in my meditation
Authentic medication
Mi inspiration
Badabang, bang, bang
Sean da Paul

[Verse 1]
Oh, man, I'm high like a kite
Still I can roll a spliff with mi eyes shut tight
Pretty girl, she said I'm on point
She like what me like and she love my type (ha!)
Said she wanna ride 'pon my bike
Said she won't give it up without putting up a fight (woo!)
Every ting run good in the night
'Til the police surface and a shine them light

[Pre-Chorus]
Mi say
Lover made me roll it
Lover made me roll it
Mister officer
Now mi make me smoke it
Now mi make me smoke it (yo, yo!)
Now mi make me roll it
Now mi make me roll it
Mister officer
Now mi make me smoke it
Now mi make me smoke it

[Chorus]
'Can, I'm a ganja man
When you see me, when you pre-set speed
If you know, man a ganja man
Indica straight in my brain, you no listen what mi sayin'
I'm a real ganja man
No cocaine in mi mainframe
Mi, I tell you this
Mi a ganja man
Tellin' mi a ganja man

[Verse 2]
If it was up to me I'd stay at home and blaze for days
On my cloud and float away, ayy
'Cause when mi steam it up, coke natural you spittin'
You don't know, we havin' a reasoning dem can't come
To mi spliff with seizing, mi tell you say dem ting, they may never believe it (si!)
Them want me farm fool, dem must be dreaming
Ganja mi farm, coke dat mi will beat it
And there's no need fi alarm, motherfucker
We don't live by the law, motherfucker

[Pre-Chorus]
Now mi make me roll it
Now mi make me roll it
Mister officer
Now mi make me smoke it
Now mi make me smoke it
Now mi make me roll it
Now mi make me roll it
Mister officer
Now mi make me smoke it
Now mi make me smoke it

[Chorus]
'Can, I'm a ganja man
When you see me, when you pre-set speed
If you know, man a ganja man
Indica straight in my brain, you no listen what mi sayin'
I'm a real ganja man
No cocaine in mi mainframe
Mi, I tell you this
Mi a ganja man
Tellin' mi a ganja man
If you know man a ganja man
When you see me, when you pre-set speed
If you know, man a ganja man
Indica straight in my brain, you no listen what mi sayin'
I'm a real ganja man
No cocaine in mi mainframe
Mi, I tell you this
Mi a ganja man
Tellin' mi a ganja man

[Outro]
(Now mi make me roll it)
(Now mi make me roll it)
(Mister officer)
(Now mi make me smoke it)

If it was up to me I'd stay at home and blaze for days
On my cloud and float away, ayy
