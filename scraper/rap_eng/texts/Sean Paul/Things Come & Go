[Intro: Sean Paul]
My girl, yeah yeah
Oh, I'll be waiting there now
Yeah mon...
Sean Paul alongside Mya

[Verse 1: Mya]
I've done some stupid shit
I've even lied to you
You know that for a fact
Plus all I've put you through (all I've put you through)
It still amazes me (me)
How you've forgiven me (yeah)
If I could take it back
I wouldn't have done those silly things

[Pre-Chorus]
(How do you do it?) A much more bigger man than me
(How can I repay you?) 'Cause you stuck in there with me
(I won't forget ya) How it's so clear. Now I see
Still you're the only one that I can count on
You never gave up on me

[Chorus]
Things come and go
Seasons change, people grow
The world turns, but our love remains the same
Things come and go
Winter, summer, spring, and fall
Through it all, our love remains the same

[Verse 2]
I don't know how it all happened, but (but)
You're everything and more (everything and more)
Even thought I might lose you
Because I didn't work hard enough
Figured since you lost my trust (ooh)
That we would just fall apart (yeah)
Now I realize I need to wake up
So I'm giving you all my heart

[Pre-Chorus]
(I remember) Oh, watchin' the clouds go by
(You were always there) Always right there by my side
(Can't forget you) I can't forget you as I reminisce on this tree
You were the only one that was in my life
Who showed me consistency

[Chorus]
Things come and go
Seasons change, people grow
The world turns, but our love remains the same
Things come and go
Winter, summer, spring, and fall
Through it all, our love remains the same

[Bridge: Sean Paul]
Things change from year to year, girl
But my love for you is always there, girl
Never fret, never have no fear
Baby, call me and I will appear, well
Things change from year to year, girl
But my love for you is always there, girl
Never fret, never have no fear
Baby, call me and I will appear, well

[Breakdown: Mya]
Can I take you away from this place?
Whatever you wanna do, oh my baby, it's cool
Take my hand, let's make plans
(Just as long) Just as long as you are here, boy, I'm with you

[Chorus]
Things come and go
Seasons change, people grow
The world turns, but our love remains the same
Things come and go
Winter, summer, spring, and fall
Through it all, our love remains the same
Things come and go
Seasons change, people grow
The world turns, but our love remains the same
Things come and go
Winter, summer, spring, and fall
Through it all, our love remains the same

[Outro: Sean Paul over Chorus]
Things change from year to year, girl
But my love for you is always there, girl
Never fret, never have no fear
Baby, call me and I will appear, well
Things change from year to year, girl
But my love for you is always there, girl
Never fret, never have no fear
Baby, call me and I will appear, well
