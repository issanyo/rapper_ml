And will we ever share?
(Will we ever share?)
Yow, yow

You who seh rule de people
Say don't it so deceiful
Yes, year to year it's clear to de youths
Dat yuh don't care

Top dollar all you wanna is thief it
Everybody know it ain't no secret
Ammunition and gun
Dat's all yuh really wanna share

I see di blood is on your hand
I see di youths don't understand
It's goin' nowhere

'Round and 'round in a circle
Politics tactics, nah, go work cauh
Too much blood gotta spill pon Earth
Man is dying everywhere

As time goes on
When will we live together?
Time goes on
And one seem so unclever

As time goes on
Will we ever get along?
When will we live as one
As time goes on?
When will we ever care?

Everybody got good and evil
Tek a look inna yourself people
Positive, negative
Which one will yuh manifest?

Everybody wah de same ting down deh
Nobody don't wanna live in a dismay
Everybody's fighting
To achieve their happiness

Some man wah rich and famous
Den dem get it switched and blame us
I wish dat those could see their emptiness

'Round and 'round in a circle
Selfishness just nah go work cauh
Too much blood gotta spill pon Earth
Man is dying everywhere

As time goes on
When will we live together?
Time goes on
And one seem so unclever

As time goes on
Will we ever get along?
When will we live as one
As time goes on?
And will we ever care?

Will we ever care?
(Will we ever)
Will we ever share?
(Will we ever share?)
End is drawing near
(End is drawing near)
Feel it in di air

Muslim and Christian
Buddhist and Hindu
Rastafarai and Jew
Will we ever share one God?

Blood's on de creeps
All these politricks man
P and p, everyday lp
Will wi ever care about life?

When de blood is on your hand
And di youths don't understand
It's goin' nowhere

'Round and 'round in a circle
Blood spilling just nah go work cauh
Too much man just a dead pon Earth
Man is dying everywhere

As time goes on
When will we live together?
Time goes on
And one seem so unclever

As time goes on
Will we ever get along?
When will we live as one
