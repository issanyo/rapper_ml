[Intro: Sean Paul, Jade Thirlwall, Perrie Edwards, Jesy Nelson & (Leigh-Anne Pinnock)]
When you drop it low and shake it, girl, you are the bomb (Switch it up, switch it up)

[Verse 1: Leigh-Anne Pinnock & Perrie Edwards, Jesy Nelson, Jade Thirlwall]
I call my girl 'cause I got a problem
Only a curl is gonna solve it

[Pre-Chorus: All]
Gotta get him out my hair
Gotta get him out my hair

I tried everything but it's useless
He pushed me so far now I'm on the edge
Make him disappear
Go get him out my hair

[Verse 2: Jade Thirwall & Jesy Nelson, Perrie Edwards & Leigh-Anne Pinnock]
Okay, gonna bleach him out, peroxide on him
Hair on the floor like my memory of him
Now I feel brand new (That's right)
This chick is over you (Hey)
We're going out, ain't got no worries
Drama now, now it just seems so funny
Got my hands up in the air

Got me going mad sitting in this chair (Got me goin' mad, he got me goin' mad)
Like I don't care

I tried everything but it's useless (Hey, girl)
He pushed me so far now I'm on the edge (The edge, no, oh)
Make him disappear
Girl, get him out my hair

[Verse 3: Sean Paul]
Yo, yo!
Inseparable at the beginning when we started
Good chemistry between me and you, girl, we got it
I spit you game and just to tame you was my target
That was my aim, just to be playing with your body
Thought that forever we could continue this party
And now you're telling me that your love is departed
Right I'm just saying you gon' miss your sugar-daddy
How you gon' get me out ya hair, girl, when I bought it?

[Bridge: Jade Thirlwall & All & Sean Paul]
Girlfriend, you need to get your phone, erase that number
Don't call him back, 'cause he don't deserve it Oh, really?
And when you see him in the club, just flick your hair
Don't show him any love, (Really?) 'cause you've had enough (Hahaha!), oh oh

[Chorus: All, Jesy Nelson & Perrie Edwards]
'Cause he was just a (*bling!*) and I knew it (And I knew it, hey)
Got me going mad sitting in this chair
Like I don't care
Gotta get him off my hair
I tried everything but it's useless
He pushed me so far now I'm on the edge (Far, the edge)
Make him disappear
Go get him out my hair

[Outro: Jade, Leigh-Anne, Perrie & All]
Hey-ey-ey-ey yeah
Girl, get him out my hair
He's in my hair, yeah, gonna get him out
Gonna get him out
Gonna get him out my hair
