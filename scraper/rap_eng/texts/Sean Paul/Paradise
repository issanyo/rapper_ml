[Intro: Sean Paul]
Bless them when there ain't no stress there
You know it go, when we flow
Straight to the girl don't ya know
A lot of beautiful ladies in the place tonight
I just wanna say, "baby"

[Verse 1: Sean Paul]
My girl if you tell me what you want
Aye girl if you tell me what you want from me
My girl, I'ma give you what you want
Aye girl I'ma give you what you want only
No, no, me never say me can't
No, no, me never say me just can't do it
My girl I will give you what you want
Aye girl if you tell me what you want

[Pre-Chorus: Sean Paul]
But I can take you there

[Chorus: KStewart & (Sean Paul)]
