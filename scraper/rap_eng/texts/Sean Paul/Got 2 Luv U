Gyal mi nuh stay like dem bwoi deh weh put you down
Mi rather lift you way up off the ground
Nuff a dem fake, dem a nuh king, a clown
Only thinking bout dem self alone
Listen mi keen, now baby tell a mi how mi sound
Run away dem likkle bwoi deh weh loser prone
Mi alone a make you start fi moan and groan
Cause mi and your love strong like a stone
Girl cause

[Bridge: Alexis Jordan]
I, I’ll do anything I could for ya
Boy you’re my only (see it deh girl!)
I, I’m gonna flip these beats on ya
You don’t even know me (aha!)
Cause I am, I
