[Chorus: Becky G]
Love me, love me like that
Love me like we ain't never let go
Love me, love me like that
Poco, poco, muy, muy lento
Take your time and do it just like we were in Jamaica or New York
Love me, love me like that
Love me, give me some mad love

Lovin' how your booty pop when the beat drop
Come in my baby when you do it is a wrap
Love the energy when you fling it up back

Good lord, girl, yuh going so hard (Woo)
Girl your legs look the best when I'm spreadin' the two apart

Good lord, why you going so hard?
Boy, I'm tryna to be good but you're making me be so bad
