As the reality of the times take hold
We come to terms with the sadness we bear
Missin' the times we never get to share
Wo wo, wo wo, wo wo, wo wo

Just a few words because we care
Still I got all the memories
Wo wo wo, wo wo

Say when mi look up inna mi life it's plain to see
That it's never gonna be the same
Take another step on towards my destiny
But the memories still remain

Deep inna mi brain, inna mi soul I hold the key
Said it's never gonna be the same
Throughout life and beyond all eternity
Yo, we keep burnin' up the flame

Wish I could rewind all these hands of time
And bring back Daddigon a great bredrin of mine
I sit and remember all the things that we spoke of
All of the serious reasonings an' all di tings we make joke
Of

Still cannot believe them took your life away
But those who pull the trigger cannot take away
The covenant the righteous have with Jah Jah
So I know I'll see you again my brother when mi think

Say when mi look up inna mi life it's plain to see
That it's never gonna be the same
Take another step on towards my destiny
But the memories still remain

Deep inna mi brain, inna mi soul I hold the key
Said it's never gonna be the same
Throughout life and beyond all eternity
Yo, we keep burnin' up the flame

Fi all the friends and families that have past on
Leavin' impressions and memories that will last on
Givin' thanks fi all the time that we know them
Reminisce them legacy that is what we owe them

Because they helped to make us who we are
So let us never forget and talk it near and far
Bless up Grandpa Lee and Aunt Chris-I
Can't forget you if I try
