And again it's one more try, you know
Ten times mi cry and a dry mi eye

And you done know a pressure i've run through

First inna mi life, man I'm feeling fi cry
Check inna mi heart baby that's no lie
Well, that's no lie

'Cause girl my world is coming to an end, ah

You, me waan fi wake and see every morning, ah
A little precious time, it anuh crime, anuh sin, ah
But you nah give man no bligh nor no play
Everyday me sit and meditate and a pray
You left mi heart inna permanent state of dismay
Woman, a waan you hear the words the DJ say

[Chorus]
'Cause you just nah give no bligh
