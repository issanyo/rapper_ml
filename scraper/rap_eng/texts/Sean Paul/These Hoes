[Chorus]
These hoes, these hoes
They're out of control
They're out of control
These hoes, these hoes
They're out of control
They're out of control

[Verse 1: Lil' Dinky]
Look bitch, I don't wanna talk to you, I don't wanna talk to you
You smell like a Little Caesar's Hot 'n Ready pepperoni pie with a slight hint of halal food
[Penis Bailey]
Look bitch, I don't wanna talk to you, and I don't wanna talk to none of your best bitches
You hoes about 6 foot 6 with the mustache, bitch, you look like Jeff Bridges
[Lil' Dinky]
Bitch, you look like Jeff Foxworthy, so please do not talk to me
Run your mouth, I might air your family out
Clap your grandfather at the Cracker Barrel
Clap your grandmama at the Crate & Barrel
[Penis Bailey]
Clap your baby sister at the Old Navy
You god damn hoes is out of control
And the Groats won't stand for it no more

[Chorus]

[Verse 2: Lil' Dinky]
I tell a bitch to get the fuck from round me
I tell a bitch to go away
When I see these hoes, I get angry and confused
I don't know what to do about it
This bitch told me, that every meal she eats is tuna salad
I said that's fucked up, I said I never heard no shit like that
I told the bitch I would never even consider putting my face near the pussy
Or putting my tongue near the butt
How you gonna eat that tuna salad for breakfast every day?
You must be out your mind
You must be out your mind

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Sean Paul]
All these bitches very dumb
Bitches very dumb
Stupid bitches in the building, and y'all bitches be dumb
Bitch so dumb, why you so retarded?
Bitch you stupid, it smell like you farted
Smell like you farted, bitch, did you fart?
Bitch, you fart so bad it be art
Bitch, you got some gas in that butt tonight
You need to go home, you need to take a Beano
You need to take a Beano bitch, Beano bitch
Why your butt be so stinky girl?
Give that butt a good cleaning, girl
Bitch you stink, bitch you suck
Bitch I wanna drag you through the muck
