[Chorus: Wiley & Sean Paul]
Boasty, boasty, Godfather, man a OG
Man a half humble, man are boasty
Fling a ragga riddim like it's '03
Boasty, house on the coast G
My money so long it doesn't know me
It's looking at my kids, like I'm boasty
Bidi bang bang bang, ayy

[Verse 1: Stefflon Don]
Ayo Idris, tell dem other gyal nuh tek di piss
When Steffy step out with a tune of energist
Body comfortable and me physically fit
And me brown and sweet just like the chocolate
Yo Wiley, dem wann' sound like me
Cause da Don yah pussy pretty wid the ochro body
Shut down any city with my bad gyal posse
Hahh, every man want piece of me
The bokkle dem ah pop and dem ah burn weed
Man want whine behind of me

[Chorus: Wiley, Sean Paul & Steflon Don]
Boasty, boasty, Godfather, man a OG
Man a half humble, man are boasty
Fling a ragga riddim like it's '03

And ready fi roll and blaze up the skank

[Chorus: Wiley]
Boasty, boasty, Godfather, man a OG
Man a half humble, man are boasty
Fling a ragga riddim like it's '03
Boasty, house on the coast G
My money so long it doesn't know me
It's looking at my kids, like I'm boasty
I fly around the world 'cause I'm boasty
Boasty, boasty, Godfather, man a OG
Man a half humble, man are boasty
Fling a ragga riddim like it's '03
Boasty, house on the coast G
My money so long it doesn't know me
It's looking at my kids, like I'm boasty
I fly around the world 'cause I'm boasty
