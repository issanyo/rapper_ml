Are you with me, baby
I wannna know, I wanna know
My girl

Try to tell you that I love you, babygirl
But it's all in vain
(In vain, in vain)
Try to tell you that I be there for you
When you call my name
(My name, my name)

If every little thing I try to do
It gon' cause you pain
(Pain, pain)
Then I might as well leave you girl
And don't come back again

'Cause you know I can't pretend
I tell you that I give you love straight to the end
Bad mind a cut we off
Them nah want we carispen'
(Correspond)
They don't understand it, from my heart

Babygirl, you know this from de start
Well, any which part you walk
You got me caught, you a di top
My pepperpot

Babygirl, I put you at the top
Well, any which part you walk
You got me caught, you a di top
My pepperpot

Girl, I'm givin' you the best of me
And babygirl, a you deserve the best indeed
Nuff a them a try fi cut my speed
And that just keeps depressing me

But nothing's gonna break my stride
And babygirl, a let me tell you, this you are my pride
If I don't get the chance to treat you right
Might as well den take my life

Have you ever buck a woman and you feel so close?
That you can't do without 'er, think bout 'er de most
Family and friend dem nuh stop from oppose
It's like watering a rose that never will grow

Time after time me a try prove my love
Cah the bond that me feel got to be from up above
None a them nuh waan fi see
Now dem mek me waan fi grief
They don't waan believe it, it's from my heart

Babygirl, you know this from de start
Well, any which part you walk
You got me caught, you a di top

'Cause they don't understand

Try to tell you that I love you, babygirl
But it's all in vain
