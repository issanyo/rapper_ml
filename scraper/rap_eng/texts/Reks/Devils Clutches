[Intro:]
It’s d world dat I live in [x3]

[Verse 1:]
Me and A, used to kick it, first floor in the lobby I
Tossing the boulders till my mom called see you tomorrow
See in the law we was all we got
Heard a nigga got shot, for double cross claws flipping the raw
I never saw me an A ending that way
Thought we was poor, had it all upstairs
Feeling prepared for future endeavors
2 of them brothers, mulla and chedar
And after dark weather, we remained together
A sabotage who's never ever been questioned
But once them sands get us a law of pleasure
Give us a minor scent we ignore the 5 percent older
Had my content, forever, to chase Benjamin faith
Any mean dream, triple bean scheme
Ski mask a thief fiend, the chain, the cash register is ding
Entice, the way you like, found a 10 pound box, pay the price

[Chorus:]
He didn't listen, he'd be working while I'm telling this stuff
Father forgive me for the sin I'm about to commit
Fucking with them niggas from that fake, true to hate you
Father forgive me for the sin I'm about to commit[x2]

[Verse 2:]
High-school's a different school yo, A a different dude dog
Handshakes become what's up with you nods
Nods become blank stares, I fear, somebody's in his gears
A went from dirt poor to fresh designer wares, ah
My nigga's tripping, pull him aside, look in the eyes to catch a glimpse and
Nothing close to recognition, I sense distance
Different night an day, used to play, hide and seek
Now seek and hides, he disguise the nigga I
Used to know, choose to blow, over code, we agreed to appow
Saw your brothers in the cuffs, yo
You ain't have to sell, sell your soul, trap a cell
Sells the cold, hell as hot, heaven knows, been to palm rose
Once or twice, roll the dice, play the cards, win a 4
10 below, tryna put more than a loaf on the stove
Drove a nigga to the street, frozen moments on the beat
Til they lay me down to sleep

[Chorus]

[Verse 3:]
From elementary homie to he don't even know me
Be in the same room, not even the peace coby, hold the peace kobe
Look in his eyes belly the beast hold me
Streets control me, so he written on his grill still
Wish I could of made him chill, only for a still moment
For he got the willpower to kill Shawty
Yeah do called her a bitch and shit
Got out of line, but if you wouldn't have left the play through the mitts, avoid time
Ain't no rewinding or going back to tossing the bomb
No mamas call see you tomorrow, the warning sign
Could have read him, could have fed him, some of the darts are mine
This blocks, all seeing the leader the blunt the blunt beat enough
Reading the rights yeah, only rights to cuffs
Or in the prime box, dust to dust
As you puff puff pass, or pour glass
In memory of those who passed
I think of A at last

[Chorus]

[Outro:]
It’s d world dat I live in
God  forgive me for the sin I'm about to commit[x3]
