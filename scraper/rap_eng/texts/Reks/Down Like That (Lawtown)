"In the beginning"

[Verse One]:
? had the killer crossover I would watch him through the fences
Just before the NBA ventures
The way they laid the homie out senseless
Execution killin', chillin' feelin' for the senses
Draw me on adventures
And just
Take a seat on the Lawrence street benches
Take a look at where I grew up
Not a screw up, I had some dedicated mentors
Who schooled me to some rules that I use when I pen a sentence
Avoid the pens sentence
Middleton for instance
Intense and since I wasn't a fool, I kept a jewel
Little infants
That grew up in my city, I have pity
No really it is crazy on the babies
In the 80's momma raised me in the little city and it made me gritty
Made me Corey, gave me spitty, end of story y'all

[Verse Two]:
It goes L.A.W.T.O. the W.N
Where trouble don't end, but trouble begin
Man, fire truck flew by another arson
You drive that Honda Civic? Watch your car son
Gangs a big thing in my city
Niggas bang in my city, blood stains what remains of my city
Spanish mami's so pretty
Bonita, mamacita, ?
????
Vatos Locos fake thugs
Insurance scams for grams
Bangin' shawty's raw by the reservoir, dam
Remember house parties and jams?
Drama broke, no one spoke to po-p, we wild we loc
We smoke, swiggin' easy jeezy
Hit up Big & Beefy
Or a booth up in Denny's by the cinemas
We all got a hood of our own so remember my

[Scratch Chorus]:
"In Lawtown it goes down like that" - Scientifik
"We be illin'"

[Verse Three]:
Shout to every set
Every G, every vet
Every unshoveled step
Every hill, every meal
Every bridge from the south to the area I rep, northside
Of course I
Slept
Next to the rats in the cat's alley
Kept, razor box cutters in my pack early
Back, when Wesley brought machete to the spelling bee
You tellin' me he beefin' with niggas here for real?
Snow storm, Crazy Joe runnin' no shirt on his chest
Naked man rapin' women, make the children scared to death
Yes, this is Lawtown, my city's a mess
But my city's the best
Still my city's got less education
So take an educated guess
Head to college or hit the corner with the rest
I'm on the death of my pops due to AIDS
Do the knowledge on them Lawtown ways
They made me craze
