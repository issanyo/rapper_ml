(Chorus 1)
Generation lack motivation
Plantation line stagnation
Frustration, no education
Final destination: liberation
Stand in line for liberation
Can't deny how far we done come
But the wrong line, the war ain't won
Free your mind, free your mind

(Verse 1)
Maybe I've been focused on the most important concept
Make a little bank, then I go and make deposits
Money is the root of all evil, but I won't object to makin' it the object of me and mine's progress

(Chorus 2)
Fuck hoes, get money
Fuck hoes, get money
Fuck these hoes
Make a little dough for you and yours

(Verse 2)
By hoes I mean the government; system ain't just got us down, got us under it
Wonder if the average politician know what hunger is
Know where single momma live, third strike felon is
Disproportionate sentences for my melanin
[?] motherfuckers know the hell I'm in
Focused on the Taliban, not the local terrorists
Ask Walter Scott's momma if she know what terror is
Zimmerman a killer. Arrested for a domestic, not pulling the trigger
The preacher swear God witcha
Same god the Mormon's say cursed us in scripture
Put on the strip to be chattel, from childhood to adult
Still no 40 and a mule passed out; what's that 'bout?
Same old, same old. Won't take the blame for they faults
Fuck these hoes

(Chorus 2)
Fuck hoes, get money
Fuck hoes, get money
Fuck these hoes
Make a little dough for you and yours
Make a little dough for you and yours

(Verse 3)
By hoes I mean the rap game; fools rockin' skirts, coonery reenactment
Sell hell to kids, they the ones you impactin'. Little deeper back when we had leaders rappin'
Nowadays less Kendricks, more Young Thugs. Fuck Worldstar, we need a war on drugs
Joke's on us, back to the back of the bus. Packin' a Mac in the back of Acuras
Ass gon' bust throught the pants, Nikki bought a new body, such a role model for ya Barbies
Pose with the papparazzi sportin' Versace. Ooh, that anaconda make a thot look naughty
Thoughts on all these shorties that's gon' be the only link to where the history book hold me
Same old, same old. Greatest of the great unknown
Fuck these hoes

(Chorus 2)
Fuck hoes, get money
Fuck hoes, get money
Fuck these hoes
Make a little dough for you and yours
Make a little dough for you and yours

(Chorus 1)
Generation lack motivation
Plantation line stagnation
Frustration, no education
Final destination: liberation
Stand in line for liberation
Can't deny how far we done come
But the wrong line, the war ain't won
Free your mind, free your mind
