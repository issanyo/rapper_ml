Some of y'all act hard, but you really ain't got no thug in you
Wonder who put that drug in you, buggin' bruh
Cock 1000 Mississippi, you pussies still ain't got to the poppin' maine
Shit talking and walking, what you talking maine, stop it maine
A philosopher with street antiquate educated rhetoric elevated
I'm slated to be the unders greatest
You never heard about word of mouth
Gossip girls herb em out, on the pearls, heard about, no doubt
Fabrication in segments, hate that you niggas faking
The papers you making, eye contact, now I'm at your hand shaking
Waking rappers back up to reality, rather be quality over quantity
Honestly, half of these actors be drag queens
Others is caffeine, quick shop disc, chop
Just give me my hip hop
Back to the basics, I take it away from the fake shit
Wrong pill, talking matrix, bitch

Hook (repeated x2)
Here I come to save the day, for the ones that fade away
Give a fuck what niggas say, ok, ok
I ain't looking at dudes, I'm looking past you
I ain't looking at dudes, I'm looking past you

What happened to the real shit dog
When you really could feel shit dog
Niggas frauds, bitches is rapping they rappin' nigga's broads
Dog, give back my lyrics cause, in the blood feel it
Ain't no gang type shit, this spreading the love
Penitentiaries pack us, in the hand cuffs
Enough to drive a man mask gloves
Pocka, pocka, blus, talking in god we trust
And the mighty dollar lust
While we stuck betties riding patties to county for us
Yeah, just the way it is, way it was, way it will forever be
Till the end of these cubs, no longer give me buzz
Hold on to memory out, asking Sean Trevor
Troy, M.O.K. above
Stay that biggy, pay for emc and emciing
And homies pray, so that they also leaving
When they've no escape, no more sour on the plate
Fuck the haters, let em hate, make it at your own pace player!

Hook (repeated x2)
Here I come to save the day, for the ones that fade away
Give a fuck what niggas say, ok, ok
I ain't looking at dudes, I'm looking past you
I ain't looking at dudes, I'm looking past you

Nigga this, nigga that, nigga juke upon that your fitted cap
Better go get that wig and tac, you don't know where to get rid of that
Weirdos getting tears, don't got no skills for real, don't really rap
Here go that, whole share go slap, her lips on dick from pills in fact
Young niggas just like you so, riding dick to get the dough
Hugs and kisses x and o, tic tac toe that's backio
Rap before was bout to flow, dope ass be the killer show
Common called y'all niggas, still actin like you killer dope
Music just don't feel no more, music just ain't ill no more
Music ain't really real no more, y'all real housewife MTV shows
Ass, ass, ass, ass, ass, ass - really though?
Kirko Bang on my brain, love the chain wearing blow
MTV raps, you sugar-coat
Nicki minaj silicone, what type of shit you bitches on
Some of these [?] he'll be my son, some of these raps and some of these poems
Some of these don't and some belong, Gotta get the picture clear, gone!

Hook (repeated x2)
Here I come to save the day, for the ones that fade away
Give a fuck what niggas say, ok, ok
I ain't looking at dudes, I'm looking past you
I ain't looking at dudes, I'm looking past you
