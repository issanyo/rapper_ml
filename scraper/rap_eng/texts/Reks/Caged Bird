Feat. EzDread
Let me out of my cage god
Let me out of my cage god
God speed to the ones who wasn’t raised like the cosby’s
No cliff in clear to give a care
For all these caged birds singing angelo’s verses
God please, give me free or give me death
And each breath we suffer indeed
Luckily, love the beats took a hold of me
Drummer down the road chose another street
And discreet, under the radar heat
Hail mary, toss the ball
Praise mary, praise the lord, praise allah
Or whoever you call, but the stars
Minuscule and the world so large
Let me out these bars
Feeling trapped and it’s suffocating televised
Jaws of life pressure penning too tight, dawg
Feeling like, feeling like, feeling like, feeling like
Feeling like hurricane carter
Suffering for all the block lords was under surveillance
From hidden cameras, was daughters of the wealthiest support cause
Daddy on his mick jagger rolling stone
Tossed a room past her, welcome to signs, too blind to see
What he’s leaving behind
He be in the rhyme, he be in the booth
And he be on the road, he need to learn the true keys
To open up the soul, set it free
Destiny tryina take control, lessons learned
Lot to know, immature, got to grow
Miniature out the door
How you out the chains if you got the dough
But ignorance remains, I wanna know
Let me out of my cage god
Let me out of my cage god
These are notes on freedom, disregard the heathen
Quotes you gotta want emancipation like you want ...
Leavers ain’t leading, m and k we need them
A million march n heaven
I could see em in my dreams they can reach me
Teach me if I believe that I can be them
Podium soap op preaching I am so pop
Today’s rappers so oprah speaking
Deaths being talk, I’m effortless talk
Passion from start, the gandhis, and the garveys
The martyrs and the always, to ever all days
All in this metal cage
Free slave to the grave, oxymoron
Boxed in but open for on, poetry 101
Let me out of my cage god
Let me out of my cage god
