[Verse 1]
Eyes Watching God visualizing the skies
Is there a heaven for my brothers who've been deprived
Prisoners who penalized ending to the Genocide
It's been disguised but times is a changing
We don't want war we just want security
Peace from authorities, targeting minorities
Ya'll could be cool calm collect Haz and Reks
At your neck for disability check cause this ability slept
Upon too long puff cigarettes to get my stress gone
Enter upper echelon the baton
Passed and we dash
On that oval towards finish line
If heaven in store please send a sign minute I'm
Out the belly bye bye to hell we climb
To the heavens tell the reverend I'm
Free of the binds that enslave minds
We need to mix guns and religion
Cause sons in the system needs funds and the wisdom
It's not about Muslim or christian find a focus
Time to notice the rope tightening on the hopeless
Throats of the oppressed
We are so obsessed with dough it's overshadowing death
Forgot what the goal is
Got to be soldiers, warriors, yes? the audience
Let me free my mind to get this sort of rhyme off my chest
It's like I'm possessed dealing with the everyday burdens
I be searching for elevators to elevate
Demonstrate destroy rebuild tactics
Exercise demons believing Jesus passions
Fuck relaxing time for infinite action
Intimate with pen I put to the pad son Clashing
With the top 'til we no longer the bottom
Put up the volume
Get your ears prepared for the bare
Essentials over hazardous sounds and instrumental
Influential to the mental beware, yeah
