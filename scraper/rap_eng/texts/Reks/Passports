Been high, all day, been high all day
Yeah, check my ...with the green of passions
No more tears, I feel I’ma need my masters
The few I see the few announcers
But light year behind rappers
Got a hustle game catcher
Russel simmons asked what
I should have been ...when
I was idolizing run
Fat laces over tongue, had the faces overcome
Hard ships in the progress, topic’s ...
I should have been heartless
I think I could have made a mill
Cook over if I would have made the bath
To shake backs on the strippers
Pass on the riches and the money making theme song
All the good I say to the hood see they wrong
They ain’t gonna liste to me
Get the picture or get the money
Rather the ladder, don’t make sense
If it don’t add up, to be a rapper
With so many tears behind laughter

[Hook]
Yeah, fancy cars buyout the car alone
With the rockstar life I paid the cost to be the boss
Yours truly, through the doors
To applaud, how farther I’ve come
And you don’t stop
London, Tokyo, you don’t stop
Portugal, Brazil, you don’t stop
Once I get that mill, I’ma chill
Day back how farther I’ve come
And you won’t stop
I’m in the clouds, about to do my cd prayer
My greedy style from Law town, italy bound
Shut down Athena for all the non believers
I see you when I see your life in a time
...call me...was a fiend for the screamers, and arenas
Applauds in the yes yes...the ex ex laws..
Raiders on bricks...how far I’ve come
Under the prog sun, passport stamped all
Toky, London, no I won’t stop, just begun
I’ve done good for the youngin from the slum
Now on your mind the trumps ignite
The revolution, but instead of shooting guns
Rebel from ...to ear drum numb
One love took rockstars on world tours
Truly yours, I got y’all forever

[Hook]
Yeah, fancy cars buyout the car alone
With the rockstar life I paid the cost to be the boss
Yours truly, through the doors
To applaud, how farther I’ve come
And you don’t stop
London, Tokyo, you don’t stop
Portugal, Brazil, you don’t stop
Once I get that mill, I’ma chill
Day back how farther I’ve come
And you won’t stop
