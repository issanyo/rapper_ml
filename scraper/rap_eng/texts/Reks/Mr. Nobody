[Bridge]
Nobody, nobody
Me against the world, trust it’s no party
‘Cause all that glitters ain’t gold
So I’ve been told
Been down them lonely roads where the nights get cold
When we was kids we used to say
“Oh the places we’ll go
Oh the places we’ll go
We’ll go so many places”

[Hook: Sample of Hope’s “The Rain Don’t Last” (+Reks)]
Could it be the world’s grown colder? (So cold)
Maybe I’m a losing soul (Well maybe I can’t win)
The more I try, it just gets harder (So hard)
And my pain is getting old
Somebody said that nothing lasts forever
Just the storm so I’ve been told
But it seems that when it rains, it pours
And you know (I try)

[Verse 1]
What becomes of a born loser?
I used to believe I was conceived to be king
Mommy was a drug user
Daddy died young, as a son I have seen
Many nights where he abused her
He was just a teen, and she was just a teen
When I was brought into their life hula
Hoop of deceit and lies
My poor bleeding eyes
Used to watch Nikki on the scooter
A daughter with no father may never realize
A man’s touch, a man’s trust, scrutinized
You either treat her like your queen or your bitch, right?
I had a lite-brite
It used to light up my life until the bills weren’t paid, and day became night
‘Zay became like my big brother
He would hand me down ‘nough hand-me-downs, get me through a few summers

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Daddy didn’t preach good loving
Just about the time Momma had me in the oven
I was something in the making
Praising Momma raised a boy through the dramas of a Papa’s leaving
I’m a believer in Karma
So when Daddy died of AIDS, complicated days of a young and
Coming of age, I’m in a daze
Let me cut straight through the chase
I lived it, no twistin’ it
Christmas was gifts from the gov’ment
Watching my Momma plummet
Baby boo in her stomach, womb
By the stove in the winters
Heart cold in the summers, summers
Couldn’t fight the belly rumbles
Humble beginnings were mine
Family lying, uncle dying
Time and time again head to that Welfare line
A ladder to climb through hard times

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Momma got the lupus in her bones
Roof is caving in like the upper support’s gone
Move to the South, still Massachusetts home
So through the sunshine, the heart is a cold zone
Harder to pen storms through wind storms
When Com. Sense said Borrow a Dollar, economy was strong
Now we try to borrow tomorrow to get from
Yesterday’s somber with limited income
Outcome: We out of luck and some
Hence I’m living from buck-to-buck
Fuck what Clinton, Bush, and Obama do
Politicians got us in the hole I just can’t fit my Momma through
It’s possible to do impossible, but by pursuit of proper route
Obstacles, keep writing and cock and shoot
Screaming “who got the loot” like Notorious B.I.,
Chose another brother now I’m victorious, see why?

[Hook]
