[Intro]
Pull up a chair, hope this reach yours ears
There's a few ideas care to share, wanna state the world affairs
It's a must I clear the air, to my listeners, prepare
Sentences so very rare

[Chorus]
When I'm alone in my room sometimes I stare at the wall
In the back of my mind, I hear my conscience call
Telling me I'm gon' be great
I'm gon' be great
I got big dreams, I'ma make it to the top spitting 16s
For the love of hip hop, for the love of hip hop
Spitting 16s, I got big dreams, I'ma make it to the top

[Verse 1]
Destiny's children, legacy building, brewing the heat
'til the cup runneth over, kettle he spilling
Reks, he fulfilling a promise to daddies and the mommas
Pushing strollers instead of pills on corners
One day we'll all be goners
Memories for our seeds to hold onto
Conjure ways that make your family ties stronger
So bonds last longer
Unless I long for asphyxiation or hunger
My past for others can't help you with your blunders
Aviate in this world when it's curled under covers
To discover dreams deferred, preferred lovers of the genuine letters and numbers
And with the feather touch the cusp of greatness
Whenever I clutch the papers
Soul of the ancient, sometimes the job thankless
Sometimes the mind blankness, and empty canvas
Maybe Kanye's got the answers
Sneakers deals, appeal's real
Still I'd rather have a message and remain nameless

[Chorus]
When I'm alone in my room sometimes I stare at the wall
In the back of my mind, I hear my conscience call
Telling me I'm gon' be great
I'm gon' be great
I got big dreams, I'ma make it to the top spitting 16s
For the love of hip hop, for the love of hip hop
Spitting 16s, I got big dreams, I'ma make it to the top
I'm gon' be great, √ç'm gon' be great

[Verse 2]
Golden retrievers holding on the olden meaning
Seem if my song has a threat, if he saw it misleading
Leaking the aura of vets, better get my shot this evening
Hello kitty worth a billion, what a wonderful feeling
I barely scratch the surface, tiptoe to touch the ceiling
Guess I'm nostalgic thinking the earlier verse is the worst
Wordsmith of the 21st century
Common era to formulate letters to perforated paper's edges
The safest bet is to never let 'em see strategic measures
If you a [?] status get graded for known records
Like a pilgrimage to Mecca, respect to the intellectuals
2000 [?] festivals, touring every show
Bodybag John Doe, toe tag inevitable
Ridicule fools who choose to test the flow
Worldwide certified, competition sure to die
Surely I stood the times, rewind, close your eyes

[Chorus]
I'm gon' be great, I'm gon' be great
I'm gon' be great, I'm gon' be great
I'm gon' be great, I'm gon' be great
