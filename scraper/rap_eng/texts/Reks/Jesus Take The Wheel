[Hook x2: N.O.R.E.]
Jesus, take the wheel
I'm too drunk to drive
Jesus, take the wheel
Jesus, take the wheel
I'm too drunk to drive
Jesus, take the wheel
Pray

[Verse 1: N.O.R.E.]
I feel like malcolm with the gun while he staring out the window
Extra cartridges but I ain't talking no Nintendo
Roll a ooh ah blunt, some say extendo
Niggas had love, I found out it was pretend, though
I entered the game with a classic, The War Report
It might burn down your fabric, the holy ghost
Legends, let me speak on your behalf
These new niggas annoying like Elliot's laugh
Put that on your rap radar, I beat to the dot, hit niggas with the AR
I been friends where them niggas slaying cane at
Same place where they claim they jump game at
Got blown puta, puneta, sell hard white, I call it Static Selektah
See, I'm the reason you got head on the highway
Frank Sinatra my Gs it's true, did it my way
Only dude I asked to get in on this song and the nigga ain't do it
Was the kid Lil Sean, fuck it, I get Detroit love anyway
Cool with Trick Trick, Detroit love any day
And see my passport is stamped, I go through customs with a Kanye rant
(Kanye's Airport Rant)
And out of town blame a Ebro or Geespin
Well, out-of-towners rocks on the box more than we then
I sit back and open up the reese lane
Still get your head walking out the precinct
I told Steven Hill that it's real, next year at the Cypher mind get killed

[Hook: N.O.R.E.]

[Verse 2: Reks]
Speed off, won't smear off, license revoked
Nights with the Henny ho, the ice, no coke
No joke, give it straight, no chaser
Planet of the apes where they go and can't come for the papers
Gorillas, pushers, dealers, killers
White boys calling themselves niggas, shit is
All type of fucked up, funeral's bucked up
Who the most stuck up till they get stuck up
Blungee off the bungee cord, balls off the Ouija board
Broads overseas, on board, call the guard
Got a dog with the bark, hell high, rough riding it
Come from an environment where gang war prominent
Most dominant me and my conglomerate
Toast to the winners, the survivors gotta honor it
Soldiers salute, all my legends pursue
Murdering the 100 proof, body in the booth
She a model, let her swatter, let her gobble what I shoot
Pop a molly in the hallway of the hass mess, too
Kendrick control bars got em in their hearse
Got em digging in their purse, try to memorize the verse
To retaliate, nowadays rappers all feather weight
Ain't no heavy weight, marshmallow pillow case
Soft with their metaphors, you ain't never met a force
Similar to N.O. and R.E. boss

[Outro: N.O.R.E.]
Yeah
And I ain't got no disrespect for the homie Kendrick
Long as kurrupt mind his business, no interest
Some of these responses, they oughta stop
Cause even when they kick down the buildings it was photoshopped

[Hook: N.O.R.E.]
