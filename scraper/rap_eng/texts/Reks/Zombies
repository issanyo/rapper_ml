Yo check check yo
Hard on my sleeve, weight on my back
Gimme [?] and I'll show you I don't know how to act
Watch them shake in the building
Fill in [?]
Black rocker forever
With the soul of Chewbacca
Godzilla the monster preying on little bunnies
Throw em slim on the money
Greatness is coming for me
Watch em [?], Fast and furious

Music [?] to raise a fuckin kid too
Open your mouth boy and trust me you're gunna lose
The quill's crew loco
Kicking the [?], sleepers need to stop and tip bottles of fuckin [?]
Hold my head higher, your momma's new supplier
Buying the fuckin block, more is the [?]
Suffering on the moonlight, zooms through skylight
The [?] on the vampire from Fright Night
Welcome to glory mama, glad that you part of this
Effortless top five, all-time greatness
[?] kid music, animal academy
The pride live outside, but that's where you would rather be
Pop hit [?]
Inhalin the toxins, I crumpled all the weed
Amy Winehouse in the jukebox

Get em all, fuck em all, eat em all, shoot em all
Make em zombies, zombies, zombies, make em zombies
Shoot em all, get em all, fuck em all, get em all
Make em zombies, zombies, zombies, make em zombies

It's goin it's gone, I knock out the park like
Show em the light, I bring out the dark like
[?] and balls, I got em for the high high
So if you talking low low, bye bye
Sixteen M-16's pointed at you
Body snatch you, [?]'ll get at you
Ridin on the track like my clique had beef with it
Kill a cartel let it be known that we did it
We don't die we do it to the death
Turn em into zombies with a [?]
