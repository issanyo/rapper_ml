(Mr. Fritz Verse 1)
I'm used to having nightmares of being chased by jakes/
Cause real niggas made mistakes for cake/
Was a product of my environment just to fit in, there were requirements/
I had to chase paper till my retirement/
My niggas chose moving Os over student loans/
Fucc niggas in my circle is like UFOs/
Used to be so clean in my Girbaud jeans/
Might've been chubby but made sure I fed my whole team/
Used to love it, appetite for destruction/
Rocked the stop snitching shirt, charged with obstruction of justice/
But fuck it we was young from the slums/
Just trying to get them Air Force ones/
Too many close calls, strays would miss us/
All the neighborhood babes would diss us/
And end up mothers like it made a difference/
We was so foul, iron jungle was so wild/
Wish I knew then what I know now...
Wow...

(Chorus Amandi)
Projects tore up, gang signs is thrown up
We drink away the pain
Long as I'm making $9.75 I'm a keep having that drive to
Chase the finer things
All I really want is good ass weed, see my seeds succeed
And a girl who don't complain
But police just wanna mess with me, never let me breathe
So I pray I see some change

(REKS Verse 2)
Wake up so many AMs, Pamela next room prayin/
So little exits given, so many extra ways in/
Frank and Eric, Zay and Me jumping roof to roof/
Them were them wonder years, now we jump from booth to booth/
Man to man my youth was adolescent bliss/
We ain't have shit but Christmas lists, tend to forget that/
Feeling that I miss
When I reminisce/
Back before I knew about this minimum wage, maximum risk/
Music loud in the whip/
We done rumbled, we pulled over ain't this about a bitch/
Crazy how time flip/
From it's all peace to do I need a piece?/
In these streets, we one barrel away from deceased/
One crooked cop away from Belly of the Beast/
All I wanna see my seed reach/
Varsity cleats, me in them seats/
Cheering loud, proud dad, so many toe tagged/
Put in a body bag, Zeke and Jojo alive, Daddy be glad/

(Chorus)
