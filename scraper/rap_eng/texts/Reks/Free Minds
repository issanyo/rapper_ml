[Verse 1: Reks]
Was taught to believe before I could read lines
Never mind the truth, faith lead the blind
Muslim, Christian, denomination dominate
Nana and Mama debate whose God is more great
Eyes gazing at the pearly gates
How I'm gon' get in
(Watch Tower Awake) Jehovah Witnessin'
Before my boys begin to formulate an idea
On which Lord to peruse, which father to fear
I hold 'em near, tell 'em think freely
Stand beside decide before you kneel near me
Make your own choices, find your own faith
Listen to the inner voices, angel and the snake
Take they place opposite shoulder blades
Them of older age
Try to drop a jewel page after biblical page
They try to raise me with they views try to play me in the news
Try to alienate me from the truth
Why in the booth I speak of revolution like it's brand new
Priest, Pastor, Deacon with the teachings  got my hands full
Lean back thinking don't follow no rules
There are possibilities in the impossible

[Hook: EzDread]
(Free Minds are Able)
Blind lead the blind
As long as your faithful you'll see it my way in time
Free minds are able
(Free Minds are Able)
Blind lead the blind
As long as your faithful you'll see it my way in time
Free minds are able

[Verse 2]
Said it be in scripture said that when he whipped ya
Was God's work, bible say a nigga must be ready to endure hurt
Bible say that we are not equivalent to Ya worth
Under dirt scum of earth, is this us Lord?
Teachers teach me, indoctrinate that we of ape species
Beneath the standing of man, rather beastly
Written in law property for masters' uses
Become useless, pick a tree to hang nooses
Was afraid to learn and fear they'd burn in hell for it
Eyes watching God for help then lies fell for it
16th Street church torched little bodies scorched
Police force don't give a fuck about black loss
Ask George Bush or Kanye
The preacher on the pulpit conned me
He said Jesus is a white man
The deceptions is frightenin'
How are we supposed to look to so-called great minds' enlightenment
When the views are skewed, the truth doctored
At some point there had to be an author
Had to be a writer with a goal
A scriber lit the fire in your soul
Handed you a good book for mind control

[Hook: EzDread]
(Free Minds are Able)
Blind lead the blind
As long as your faithful you'll see it my way in time
Free minds are able
(Free Minds are Able)
Blind lead the blind
As long as your faithful you'll see it my way in time
Free minds are able

[Refrain: EzDread]
Live with these rules
And you play the fool
Letting go of goals
Selling off your soul
And if you stray you're not living right
How can we believe the lies
And if you stray you're not living right
How can we believe the lies

[Hook: EzDread]
(Free Minds are Able)
Blind lead the blind
As long as your faithful you'll see it my way in time
Free minds are able
(Free Minds are Able)
Blind lead the blind
As long as your faithful you'll see it my way in time
Free minds are able
