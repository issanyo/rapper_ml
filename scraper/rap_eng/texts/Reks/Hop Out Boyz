[Hook]
Be wary on the block when you pop them toys
All got to watch for them hop out boyz
They hopped out boy
Oh there they go

[Verse 1]
Hear a pop pop followed by a (woop woop woop)
Or the cops dogs snooping through the socks
Moving through the spots
Where the movie hitchcock horror flicking jurisdictions
Better watch when they hop out boy
Don't block out noise of the sirens boyz
Violence riding dirty you ain't heard me
I see but ain't involved it don't concern me
Early bird get the wormy
Niggas put that work in thirst in for Milwaukee jerseys
Bucket for the buck
Better keep it tucked tuck
That hand and hand end up in the officers clutch
Now you are shit out of luck fuck
What you are going to do now
When you hear the infamous sound (woop woop)
(That's the sound of the police)
Pardon me there they go I'm off this

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Yo enough is enough
Federals trying to set you up
Plant a gun plant a badge put you in a cuffs
Sag waiving a badge [?]
Whats the dirty pig for the panthers
Jay ego was a cancer
Cross dressing bitch I don't do dirt
But I do dirt I don't snitch
I wish a nigga would claim hood when he [?]
Yeah yeah rapidly to avoid [?]
By the 9 do your time did the crime don't speak
Chin up don't weep
Streets alert don't sleep
Damn homie why you telling on your man homie
Fuck happened to crew
Avenues full of shoulda woulda coulda's
To the baby mothers left alone in they hunger
To them long biz cause them boys is patrolling through [?]
There they go I'm off this

[Hook]
