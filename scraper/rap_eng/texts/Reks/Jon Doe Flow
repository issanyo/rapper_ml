[Hook]
Most official, my first [?], the fuck you thought?
This road is gritty, this hard, this dish
Bar for bar none of y’all fucking with me
Jon Doe flow, I jump in the booth, you jump in my bodybag
I jump in the booth, you jump in my bodybag

[Verse 1 - Reks]
Let’s get this shit straight, poking out your chest like you 6’8”
Barber shop, line up these rhymers with the switchblade
Pussy perpetrating like they pistol [?]
It appears niggas’ fears is here, flow crystal clear
Yeah buddy, no Harlem Shake or Dougie, just a [?]
Hanging from a bungee, king of underground, but not Bun B
Lingered in the [?] town, men will shut us down
Thugs around, Lawrence, thug town, whatever you want to call it
Drama all it ever amounted too
Wanted to get and prove
I belong elite status, these rappers average
And the industry some motherfucking nappers
Futon mattress, spit elastic, zigzag-ish
Not to brag but I’m sort of a big deal
[?] B, flip the collar, a la Fonzy
When it’s gone be
We can keep it cool, calm, collected
Get the Reks with respect or get the beast nigga foaming at your neck

[Verse 2 – Ea$y Money]
This is not that forbidden food, Kendrick and Cole shit
This is kill everybody, Kendrick Control shit
My men spit ferocious
Put me on the track it’s fuck friendship, you know this
I’m killing y’all all, I body bag cats when I jump in the booth
My soldiers all lined on the front and we shoot
When I spit a verse Imma make a nigga feel like I dumped in his roof
And he slumped in his coupe, it’s bout bars
You assume it’s common sense
Now niggas be tryna battle with accomplishments
This cat was raised back in the days when they used to rap amazed
Now they tryna get by cause of their accolades
That shit is corny homie, that’s a fact
Picture Jay coming at Nas with a stack this fat
[?] with [?] with a platinum plaque
They done told him that shit whack, take that shit back my nigga

[Verse 3 – Termanology]
You want to play games
Like an assassination outside my pay grade
That got goons barely out of 8th grade that spray crazed
Run up in your spot, pour acid in your baby’s crib
Make your grandmother give me head while we take a shit
Pull the U-Haul truck right up to your kid’s school
Take the whole class, throw em in a piss pool
Fuck the world, hope a comet drops on your fucking house
Shattered the earth to pieces, my dogs off their leashes
Go to war with these rappers, cause they’re the fucking weakest
I been the best KFC for with all of my releases
Ain’t a motherfucking thing changed buddy
I treat every match like [?] rings to me
I’m a king, you a peasant, make your bitch slave for me
Make her tat my name on her and piss on your grave for me
You a lame to me, have my crusade get the flames for me
They ain’t playing, they’ll throw you in the back of the Range for me
I’m a mastermind, you better respect my war strategy
Kidnapping em, I’m Bin Laden with bombs strapped to me
Actually they should shackle me cause ain’t no match for me
Incredible Hulk, destroying anybody passing me
Fuck an innocent bystander, we fire hammers
[?] rappers that are battered and take their body for ransom
I don’t give a fuck, fuck rap, take off the mask
I’ll body you in real life, zip em up, body bag
