[Verse 1]
Forever better for every letter slicing
Sever I could never ever hear my life
Write this bullshit I’m full decking cards all in
Even if i sell a couple copy you ain’t stopping me from my calling
I’m falling in the matrix lost the on on the day ship
Hate them on the waitlist but wait this better than you fakers
Who make shit that don’t stand the centries
Decade after decade they going to remember this syphoneys
The memories of those who past battons on
And i put it in the song my dialect was born
And my respect for them and introspect gone
An another fada being here
Greater MC yea
You supply the beat and I supply the teaching
Dialing the lama of the mada rhyming
Will keep you seeking 10 boot to beeking to the plight
Of the weak link the less fortunate the gift bringer
3 kings to the crysis stable upon my table
To disregard false prophet fable stable
Not for profit for progress through process God bless
See you see you when I see you still lost in this nonsense

[Verse 2]
Capital lines my mind aware time will be the age compared
To the yesteryears them other ways lost days memory fades
Then they crave for who gave flow on the page
Today no innovations sun setting up suddenly they forget what
Reppin mean I’m forever team Bunda BAP cause the streets raised me
Amazingly make them feel wait and see stay in a real
Patiently dealing deal or no deal ill
Stay with those who still remember essence that will manifest
Presence to withstand the test of time to show the realer lessons
Minding the real confessions I’m heavens hills destined
I’m playing chess and you playing checkers
Record checking you can’t crown all the wars in the underground
Morph on the sound better round head running around
Track eat your cranium athlete in gymnasium
It’s amazing ya’ll kill crossover
I’m pasting them shots taking them
Gray allen shooting sharp darks through the loss
Doing the other art prove them unworthy lost
In my own worldly view if ya’ll want through
Got a scope for ya’ll to peek to
