Showoff!
Represent 2010 y'all
Yeah, ya boy R to the...
Nah, fuck that, no intro lets get into the shit man, Check

Straight up shit is real and any day could be your last in the gutter
Baby mothers is having babies, younger and younger
Jungle survivers hustle dimes
Upholdin' suppliers, keep an open iris
A jarred vision of women that spread the virus
Burner beside us, no father figures to guide us
Niggas keep the hood alive with fire flaming from the barrel cyphers
Pistol circles, where the bullets exit then retire
The mental pieces be piecing ya mental on the side of
Concrete, moms weep, the crime's for hire
Sigh as, heaven's angels lie above us
Dying brother's lie beneath the tyres
Wheels keep spinning, beef ending because of God
Why does bad happen to good folk? Just realise if
Ya eyes is watchin' God, on ya knees, God the father
It's like a job and pray, you play your part to get your hearts desired
In our society Satan seeking to guide us
Seek asylum in the speakers volume, on my words rely
And represent...

Represent, represent! (x4)
