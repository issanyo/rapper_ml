[Verse One] [Reks]:
A metamorphosis to the glorious one in all of us
Still in a cocoon, my story is
Not yet spread
Wings only just ready for the growth
Making the most of my career hopes
I wrote, butterfly effect the rose, Reks with prose, next to those
Shakespearean quotes I hold visions of living these odes drop in the wind
Suppose I should hit the drink less
Success is so further roads, Father Ave, father have mercy
Goals of Destiny's Child, wow, holds dollars to fold
Now I'm on my second child, wild, Lord knows
I froze, stumble while those chose to pursue degrees
Crew and me ate every true MC, dough's
There for the taking in loaves
Hoes said you live one life
The kid and the wife conquer the show
Over sea shores my music is gold
No plaques but behold
Sea of hands, screaming fans on the road, yo

[Hook] [Reks]:
Rap-a-nomics, rapping dollars we all crave
We was brought up in the hood so the hood stays
Passing bottles, my niggas rep that good hey
Laughing, reminiscing on the days we were
Rap-a-nomics, rapping dollars we all crave
We was brought up in the hood so the hood stays
Passing bottles, my niggas rep that good hey
Laughing, reminiscing on the days

[Verse Two] [Termanology]:
We call it rap-a-nomics, don't rap if you rap in college
I slash up like any competition when I'm on a mission
Cause I'm an alcoholic anonymous rap-a-holic
Misogynist targeting anyone that I want to kill
The marijuana feels amazing when I get to blazing
Erasing the memories from back in the days that enrage me
Made me far from lazy, carving my name in the game
Then engraving my label, when I do the crown will be on it
So just crowd around it, applaud it then start to vomit
Cause I make you sick, but you know I'm the shit
It's that Lawrence spic holding on a quarter brick
And I never left the hood where my daughter live
I'm on the corner with killers who kill for ornaments
Insubordinate boardies who pour out their heart in all they stories
I'm in Purgatory hoping to pass Hell, smoking my last L
Smiling, kicking my sad tales

[Hook] [Reks]:
Rap-a-nomics, rapping dollars we all crave
We was brought up in the hood so the hood stays
Passing bottles, my niggas rep that good hey
Laughing, reminiscing on the days we were
Rap-a-nomics, rapping dollars we all crave
We was brought up in the hood so the hood stays
Passing bottles, my niggas rep that good hey
Laughing, reminiscing on the days

[Verse Three] [Sha Stimuli]:
Look
No sons or daughters but I made it as a fucking author
I'll probably trade it though I made it, someone made an offer
Then I can change my course up
No regrets, but my life is like I'm running underwater
Chasing success
With an anchor around my ankle and a weight vest strapped to me
Yeah it's taking long but in the end I'm getting strong
Wrong or right I came in bonkers, shedding light don't make me conscious
Halloween, you can dress up like me, I'm such a monster
Stimuli, come gave responses cause I'm honestly the honoree
Honor me before my late departure
I don't wanna be a goner but when I'm gone I'll only leave half
And only half of my music gets computed
Blame my father, blame my....
Blame my mother, blame my grandma and grammar teaching skills
Taught me words now I form death sentences and I kill
If I never reach a mill, only 50,000 sold
That's a 100,000 eyes and ears no longer closed
Let's go
