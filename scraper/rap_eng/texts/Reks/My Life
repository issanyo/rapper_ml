Reks talking: Oh yea, yea.. Almost famous

[Hook]
Take a moment, reflect
Get it together, oh yes
We getting rid of the stress
Only before it steps
Escalators to the top of the sky
We gon rise
Open up your eyes
See, I'm...
(just figuring out my life)
To the beat of my heart, It won't stop, y'all
To the beat of my soul, it keeps goin on

To the beat of my heart, It won't stop, y'all
To the beat of my soul, it keeps goin on
(just figuring out my life)

[Verse 1: Reks]
Confused as I been as to where and when the road to success goes, and stresses end
I am the key to my fate
Moment I wake
My eyes see the mistakes
In my lifetime
Write rhymes to the beat and the rain, knowing that tomorrow will bring blue skies
Easing the pain so I can figure life
(get it right)
Straighten the aim
AM to PM
We reaching
Until we eatin
Me and Blaze P. fam knowing we can
Amass cash fast for the son and wife
(figuring out my life)
The goal is to win
The road begin
The moment my pen touch the paper
We blend like chemicals
When we on it
Who want it?
Open up your eyes
Sky is the limit, believe we on the rise
I'm
(figuring out my life)

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Reks]
The forward push is a must, get a rush when I
Hit the zone
And it's all for the throne and I
Put it down get it in
On my life dogg
Want the crown with the mic so I write y'all
Day and night, y'all with the grind on my mind
And the time on my side
And the homies who gon ride
I'm an OG and I
Never sleep till I die
Never weep to the
Skies open up for me
Gotta preach, gotta teach
What my peeps told me
Still I'm
(figuring out my life)
We gotta awake
Willin to make sacrifices
Life at stake
To reappear in the afterlife
I feel the spirit in my lyrics of the ghost past
Try to awake him when I scribble on the notepad
Still I'm...
