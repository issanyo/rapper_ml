Many wanna play [?] margarita

[Verse 1]
To the rebs don't spend on the Benz

Me and my team on business [?] hands on me
Gonna get this to the roof had o prove all in you, you
Put that beat on you while I hit that [?]
I'mma do me, nigga, nigga do you
Eyes watching by on day two
014254 look on floor for look a Bible
Swear there anybody try to compare close no
With the eye stumble a in the air like Bruce will
In the bluff way flango, real cheap nigga
Hold on the halo, demon not an angel
You a hater better lay low cause the end of these days ain't so slow
You roll, you know, chilling, chill
Look in the eyes like can't really tell, homie really care
For family heal, for anything not to make my lil
Stand up, stand down on the stand

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Hey yo many man try to play he margarita

Farwell on my back so I'm looking up for '
Nigga is all and it's like funny
Scream and tell me how the cash get up getting money getting laugh that
Nigga smoking cash won't pass that
Same rock and jewelry, I heard that getting money is like
Show me how the stash out
Ball, all my nigga's gone, ten guns on my show
But it's craning how in roll but all the town just know
They hit me in my face, anybody showing love
But fuck that I need gold
Build it out from the stove
My life on the road, hotel like my home
Watch your mouth before my phone
Niggas 'then I'm so cold
In my veils ooh all these banz in my pocket see the banz see the money don't fall
See them come, see them go
When they go nigga ooh, no friends all for my niggas gonna blow
Crop on it but move slow bust hit it but look so blush
With this big four, four
Shut it 'til it ain't no more
Bullets fly man down getting low

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Let's talk about your damn complex see it so get it shutting
Such a fine concept, feel you all and getting on and on
For your holly and get it now, waw
To fit a crowd and hell I got wild
Plus for your'concern
You heard Jesus and getting by the way
And then they turning Jesus some more?
What you got next is done
Lift the income to pist and bust on
Not to say I'm super bust church
But you work double hit shit with this smart
Lost me long ago I don't even listen
I could be wrong, you rob me as a Christian
There for, I'm maybe on your face but when you speak a bit
Is such a as taste some of your mistakes like this sweet interruption
But something that took a little damn shit
A new fly topic electric but you are two ever
Call a spade, a spade you a reason to bust a behavior
You're ball is no eminence and gt jay
And you and get on
Now you nigga know you and I no, nigga don't
Not back nigga aah, ball for it, bath never heard die for
I'm back nigga like you hitting back on

[Hook]

[Outro]
To the banz gonna spend on the ranges
This loyal lances, this loyal lances
It's all business
