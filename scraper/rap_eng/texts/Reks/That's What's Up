[Chorus] [Bossman]:
I like to sip a little Remy in a plastic cup
Yeah nigga that's what's up
A quick ménage with these broads when they ass is tough
Yeah nigga that's what's up
Hey, I say fuck to the po-pos, the fiends and the hoes
Jewelry game so cold, you would think it snowed
ShowOff, ShowOff
Come fuck with us
Yeah nigga that's what's up

[Verse One] [Bossman]:
I'm goin' in like a robbery
Go Hard policy
Leave a nigga holy ghost, just like the Bible be
Sorry my apologies, nobody as hot as me
Out here doin' numbers dawg, just like the lottery
I'm on the come up, so fly can't come down
This the re-up, two flips off one pound
You never see ah, MC ah, this G ah
This killer, so fly, Aaliyah
No Lear, jewelry game is so clear
Chandelier, shit could stop six deers
Ball hard
Got these haters so skeeeer!
Ball so hard got these haters so scared
When it's time to ride, put this shit in fifth gear
Fuck So So Def, bring the noise to your ear
In case you can't hear
I know that you heard me, 36 for a birdie
D.C. connect, too high on the scurbie
H-Town pay three like an Iverson jersey
Home of Carmello
Boss heavy metal
I spit fire like I swallowed the Devil
So many dead presidents, pockets need a shovel
Gonna need an elevator to get up on my level

[Chorus] [Bossman]:
I like to sip a little Remy in a plastic cup
Yeah nigga that's what's up
A quick ménage with these broads when they ass is tough
Yeah nigga that's what's up
Hey, I say fuck to the po-pos, the fiends and the hoes
Jewelry game so cold, you would think it snowed
Come fuck with us
Yeah nigga that's what's up

[Verse Two] [Reks]:
Ghetto America
Hello etcetera
Me and Boss, cha-cheddar cha-chingin' on the register
Chill changes come in my brain
Buggin' my name, buzzin' my plane, land in Japan
London, I am somethin'
Outer space, sendin' out of states
We are now at face to face with skyscrapes and it feels Tony
Tiger, I mean great
Homie why you hate?
I ah, sire, sayonara to you fake
Fuckin' flakes, Planet Of The Ape
I'm an orangutang above the waist
Below the neck, holdin' the weight
I'm a Warrior like Danse, Fizzy Wo and Golden State
Po-po wanna chase the check
The paper work I'm straight
Nah, you ain't gon' place no handcuffs on my ? you riff
You spit 'gainst Reks, it's risk you take
You want your cake, ain't even finish what's on your plate
Dinner time, get in line, food for thought man

[Chorus] [Bossman]:
I like to sip a little Remy in a plastic cup
Yeah nigga that's what's up (SELEKTAH)
A quick ménage with these broads when they ass is tough
Yeah nigga that's what's up
Hey, I say fuck to the po-po's, the fiends and the hoes
Jewelry game so cold, you would think it snowed
Come fuck with us
Yeah nigga that's what's up
