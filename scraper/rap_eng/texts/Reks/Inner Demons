[Verse One] [Reks]:
Peace of mind, tryna find, I done been through the B.S
You see Reks, you see stress, I ain't lyin'
But times spent gettin' bent, secrets I've tried to keep under wraps
It always seep into Reks
Yes to that I gotta say acts of crime I committed, ain't been comfortable with it
Wifey find numbers, couldn't admit it, so I hid it
Get over, been done with it, ain't been sober a minute
Anger management, I need it, I be screamin' when it's cause for chill
And even grills from the block cause chills
Had to learn hand skills at an early age
Tears I put upon page
Papi went to the grave, thought I was headed next
Mimic his ways, check
From minimum wage so I would hit the malls
Five finger discounted it all
My dawgs told me I was ignorant and it's suppose to be the mirror's image
We see the truth, but me? I'm too distance
See for instance
I can't get close to most who show love
Gotta have control of, the operation
Operation: Shut Down Friendship
And I'm to blame when shit go astray
So they say
So I stay
Searchin' for an inside cure
I'm still insecure
Not to insult your
Shit, but my shit
Built with an ego
Here go, I go too far
It's these demon's y'all

"Yeah, head crack head crack"
"At war with them inner demons, it's goin' down" - Method Man 'Perfect World'
"Yeah, head crack head crack"
"It's fucked up when your mind playin' tricks on ya"
"Yeah, head crack head crack"
"At war with them inner demons, it's goin' down"

[Verse Two] [Why-D]:
I was dropped on this earth in the blistering cold
And I stopped being a kid when I was six years old
Developing suicidal tendencies
With a mind full of painful childhood memories
No pops to my crib, I was left on my own
A lonely child with barely flesh on my bones
I fell in love with alcohol at an early age
And gettin' high and skippin' school was an early phase
I still struggle to this day to keep my self afloat
I just woke up from a heavy night of alcohol
I lose control when I start drinkin'
Cause when I start drinkin', that's when I stop thinkin'
Suppressed emotions combines with aggression
That part of me is a sign of depression
I got a blackout from three o'clock til about five
And how the fuck did I get this black eye?
This alcohol got the best of me
Cause every time I'm drunk it's like I'm switchin' up identity
I fell down some stairs and I think one of my ribs broke
And every time I'm drunk I always feel the urge to ***** ****
I gotta get a grip man, I gotta stay sober
And fix up my life before it's over
So if I did you wrong, take it how you want it
I got demons deep inside that has yet to be confronted

[Scratch Chorus]:
"Yeah, head crack head crack"
"It's fucked up when your mind playin' tricks on ya"
"Yeah, head crack head crack"
"At war with them inner demons, it's goin' down"
"Yeah, head crack head crack"
"It's fucked up when your mind playin' tricks on ya"
"Yeah, head crack head crack"
"At war with them inner demons, it's goin' down"
