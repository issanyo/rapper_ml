[Hook: Easy Money]
Ayo, threes in the air, threes in the air, Murder Mass ain't nothing
But G niggers' here, time for Boston, MC's getting near, it's time to go in
And show them we've been prepared, it's Boston

[Verse One: Reks]
Banner City, hope you with me from the bottom to the tip top, this for Diesel
This for Triple, this for Ed Rock, this for Checkmark, putting me on my first song
Then along came the chosen, I was flowing in the golden era
With the Esoterics and the Mr Lif's
Back when Gin the MC lost the rap battle to Alias, the areas is six one seven
Nine seven eight, it's kinda great, we making a name for Scientifik state
Home of politics as usual, we got wolves on the prowl, who repping Bean
Put your threes in the clouds and rep it proud, MA, double cha ching
Home of The Source and some of the real original G's belong to Boston
Pardon, I'm a Lawtown arson but I do this, for please insert your city
Massachusetts, Spitty let's toast, nothing but G's over here, ShowOff
ST dot, threes in the air

[Hook: Easy Money] [x2]
Ayo, threes in the air, threes in the air, Murder Mass ain't nothing
But G niggers' here, time for Boston, MC's getting near, it's time to go in
And show them we've been prepared, it's Boston
