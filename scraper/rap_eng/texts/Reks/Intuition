This little light of mine within my mind ima let it shine, shine bright, ima let it shine

I'm practicing self reliance 'till I am one with giants
The mind is too compliant and complacent
Facing the force of tyrants, stand clear
Of society norms, do not conform
Individually we are all born, torn
From the womb toward a death
To environmental storms
And my pawns bring on [?]

Who look beyond TRIN of the day
Whatch the day dawn I embrace the greats yawn
And the days spawns

All spring or whatever popculture is offering
Idiot box forced and bought what they endorsing
If such and such celebrity telling me it's awesome
It's gotta be cause such and such just wouldn't lie to be
Tough enough to try to be god about a status quo
Cause in the lows what the uppers say matters
I am my own institution minus tuition
Listen to enters the intuition

X2
Listen to enters the intuition
Listen to enters the intuition
Wishing we could all master marvelous inventions
Following light from inside intuition

It's synthetized by the times we in line with typical
Laugh at detached free thought of individuals
Your life gotta be i-quivalent to be relevant
I benefit from i membership
I member just got the burial to flip or the sky grand[?]
Now they recognizing my print by hand
Am I to understand a plan to expand by making us work less
[?] and degrees is worthless

The persons who succeed live by the cutthroat creed
To satisfy needs [?]
Have we stoop to the lowest
Eye of the thought provoking poecy
The [?] is written for the hopeless
The hard working are certain we're gloryroaders
And [?] where the good deeds are there's no reporters
I am my own institution minus tuition
Listen to enters the intuition

X2
Listen to enters the intuition
Listen to enters the intuition
Wishing we could all master marvelous inventions
Following light from inside intuition
