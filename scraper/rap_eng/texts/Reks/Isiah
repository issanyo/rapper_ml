[Verse One]
I'm scared for the life of my son
Snipers could turn this into D.C. easy
Poke holes in trunks and try to rest in peace me
I say a prayer that Zeeky will be afraid of guns
No water pistols, investin' his mind in blazin' young
City Of God we live amongst the evil
Lines and needles on my mind since little
Knew shot could riddle through me
These younger dudes is unruly usin' a tooley truly
To be governor, imitatin' Schwarzenegger movie
Votin' for Nader for we got no greater one to rep
Hopin' our savior, we rise too many nights he slept
Through Satan's celebration, don't tell 'em for Hell we waitin'
We waitin' for Heaven's statement, rebirth until the dust
In a city where we so greedy and full of lust
Daily sinners and needy killers, ready to bust
I saw Billy caught up on the block
Alex caught up with the Glock
Isiah won't fall dog, not on my watch
Because

[Hook]
I look up to the heaven's and I
Say somethin' that'll get me by
Isiah you gon' always be held down
With this music that I write all night
For them streets that I ride through every
Night and day I stay on the grind
Cause shit's hard, but I paved the way
My son will be alright and know that it's okay

[Verse Two]
Real life speech, conceal my weeps amidst the day to day
Worried that them shots may pop where little Jayden play
Shavin' greys, achin' bones
Underrated, lacin' poems
Heavy rent, money spent
Wife and I vacating homes
No vacation home
In a grizzle zone, real life
My niggas gone, we like
"It's only flesh and bones."
Soul survivor life, a mortal fires for the fire for the stress
9 to 5 TV hustle, pinchin' pennies more or less
Wishin' Benji wore a vest, missin' Billy's school and me
Uncle B, Audrey, Neil
Urban Bobby's eulogies
I say a prayer Lord
For Isiah Lord, that you save him Lord
From the Devil's clutches
Amen Lord
Forgive us for our sins cause we are men and nothin' greater
Depends upon the pen if I don't place the sword to haters
Bush and Kerry both degrade us, next time
I'm pickin' Nader
Wish life, was dreams so they could pinch and wake us
My God

[Hook]
I look up to the heaven's and I
Say somethin' that'll get me by
Isiah you gon' always be held down
With this music that I write all night
For them streets that I ride through every
Night and day I stay on the grind
Cause shit's hard, but I paved the way
My son will be alright

[Verse Three]
Underrated but still hated amidst the rubble
Those that meet me at glace think I be strictly trouble
Per chance
All that still will not weaken my hustle
Feel the weakened muscles
Grey hairs from past struggles, beware
Too quick to assume to avenge his loses
Ideas
Say I was walkin' through the holocaust with
Despair
Livin' every fear, non-cautious
Why care?
But then the reason came for the caution
Isiah
Say a prayer for my little man
Amen
And for my father to be born again
Cause when
I see the homie at the gates I may
Refrain
Not be able to wash his sins away
The pain
I am forgiven so I must forgive
Driven to do more than just scribble sentences with relentlessness
Payin' rent, makin' sense till my day is spent
If it's meant to be rap Lord
Finally say it meant

[Hook]
I look up to the heaven's and I
Say somethin' that'll get me by
Isiah you gon' always be held down
With this music that I write all night
For them streets that I ride through every
Night and day I stay on the grind
Cause shit's hard, but I paved the way
My son will be alright and know that it's okay
