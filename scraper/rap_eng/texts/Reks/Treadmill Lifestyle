[Verse 1:G.Huff]
Look out the window
See my ? struggling
Dudes thugging him
On the boulevard hustling
Selling dope for the fuck of it
And loving it
Snitching on the same niggas
That they got in trouble with
Treadmill lifestyle
The cycle never ends
Spirit of my friends
Blowing in the wind
Got a couple relatives
In the pen
Never gonna see them again
So I don't write letters
But I encourage their kids
To try to be better
Go to school and get good grades
During semesters
Looking back
On my old neighbourhood
Things done changed from Logan Avenue
To Ravenwood
My high school sweetie
Is smoking crack now
A few of my homies
Is shooting smack now
Some vengeance and tourniquets
In the background
Treadmill lifestyle
The cycle never ends

[Verse 2:Reks]
Shit that little nigga copped a brand new burner
Heard them shots was burping
The moment was talking murder cycle of the
Treadmill lifestyle the never ending turner
Revolving doors below the earth
Behind the walls you know your worth
But still be lost
Still be on them avenues
Pounding the frost off the Timberland
Daddy was a thug you resembled him
Intention to carry the cross
Nah you carrying tradition
To be the son of a gangster
Come with the perception
You fill up his shoes
Foot steps in direction
Aim with perfection
Stick up kids
Section .80 out for dinner plates
Barely pressing against the spine
Take a glimpse in the mind
Ain't no blimps in your world man
Sure sign
Niggas gone do whatever but cha ching
Rob, kill, steal, poverty, real
You know what I mean

[Verse 3:G.Huff]
When you raised on the north side of Youngstown
Never put our guns down
In the spot where the drugs found
Crack vials on the ground
Niggas tripping wild
Prostitutes on the prowl for another mile
Brenda's got another baby
And another mouth to feed
Can't succeed in the streets
Can barely eat making $200 a week
Kids need shoes on their feet
It's that deep
Children eating cold cuts
For the whole month
With the Ramen noodles
Kool-Aid and toast strudels
That's all you get
That's all you got
You want more so you resort
To hitting the block
Flipping the box
Licking them shots
Killing sprees, robberies
Non-stop
Treadmill lifestyle
The cycle never ends
Trapped in poverty
Still praying for a Benz
