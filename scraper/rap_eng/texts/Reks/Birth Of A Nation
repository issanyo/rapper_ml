[Intro + hook: Reks]
This is the birth of a nation

Native, Caucasian, American
African slaves and immigrants settle in
Sweltering melting pots, mixing up with citizens
Beginning and end, birth of a nation
Native, Caucasian, American
African slaves and immigrants settle in
Sweltering melting pots, mixing up with citizens
Beginning and end, birth of a nation

[Verse 1: Reks]
What began in the land for the native
Was followed by the basis of [?] made supreme through enslavement
I can see the slave ships, with my forefathers' faces
A predestiny beyond racist
Misinterpretations, show victory for our nation
A conquering of savage Indian, Negroid simpleton
Greatest crimes where witnessed then, but no loss for men
Minus the Anglo-Saxon fraction
Skin pigmentation placed us in another class than white saddlers who embellished their past, so laugh
The native's history was erased quick, therefore a face became faceless
Dare I say a facelift was brought [?] nostrils, bigger lips and eyes
Something disguised as inhumane to brutalize
Taught to love the bluish eyes, less you and I
Take their statements so let's debate them
The birth of a nation

[Hook: Reks]
Native, Caucasian, American

Sweltering melting pots, mixing up with citizens
Beginning and end, birth of a nation
Native, Caucasian, American
African slaves and immigrants settle in
Sweltering melting pots, mixing up with citizens
Beginning and end, birth of a nation

[Verse 2: Reks]
No longer natives they immigrated from all world places
To make a broad new world, their own oasis
A melting pot, placed in contrast with colonial [?]
English citizens wake up
To new arrivals, been on survival
Being religious or political
Fleeing from prosecution is critical
Told that an economy grows beyond your shores, then of course
Do what it take to get across
The vast ocean, last notion
Of being lost in a land that ain't rightfully yours
A people divided become, unified into one
From Ellis Island to slums and ghettos marching to the beat of a drum
Declare independence to some, freedom to all
Come in the form of the speech of the gun, assemble young
Tell 'em revolutionists come, have you been waiting
Take a journey with Reks, birth of a nation

[Verse 3: Reks]
Modern times tell me we progress, from destiny manifest
Thirteen colonies expand to the west
Fifty states now govern the universe, Big Brother request
Little Brother show our power, respect
Michelle stressed, for the first time she prolly U.S
They tend to guess, we can and we did I guess
But [?], Martin's dream deferred
[?] on crash scene I heard
Mother of a movement urge
All my [?] think equal to search, free people emerge
From degrade depression submerge
Supreme law found written in words, proclamation of revolt
No longer to a king I serve
This day and age do we really deserve, what was written in blood
Evil look good, all [?] preserved
Playing crash through the tower after tower tumble down to the basement
Birth of a nation

[Hook: Reks]
Native, Caucasian, American
African slaves and immigrants settle in
Sweltering melting pots, mixing up with citizens
Beginning and end, birth of a nation
Native, Caucasian, American
African slaves and immigrants settle in
Sweltering melting pots, mixing up with citizens
Beginning and end, birth of a nation

[Outro 1]
*Let a new earth rise. Let another world be born. Let a bloody peace be written in the sky. Let a second generation full of courage issue forth; let a people loving freedom come to growth. Let a beauty full of healing and a strength of final clenching be the pulsing in our spirits and our blood. Let the martial songs be written, let the dirges disappear. Let a race of men now rise and take control.*

[Outro 2: DC The MIDI Alien]
*This has been Avengers Radio Volume 1*
*On behalf of my ECA counterparts I wanna thank those who stuck around and listened to the whole show, even if it wasn't what you were expecting to hear today*
*As for mister Rushmore here, hopefully this incident will serve as a warning, to these other fear peddling [?] personalities who insist on force feeding their opinions to the petrified masses*
*Yo man I hope you got someone who cares about you enough to come to the stage and untie you man, cause we outta here*
*People, keep your eyes open, don't be scared to question things*
*DC The MIDI Alien, East Coast Avengers, until next time, peace*

*Muffled talking by Phil Rushmore*
