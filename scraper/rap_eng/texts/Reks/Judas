He looking for answers, too many men lie
Give them fools a million chances, look them in they eyes
But they looking to the side, to the floor, to the sky
They are poison, they are cancers, demons on the sly
See them digging in your pockets, filling in the rockets
Trigger cock back, pop top
See them sit up in the shotgun, gassing, got none
Spend in your cash, up chop
Chop it up with you, fuck with you, whenever you got
When you ain’t, they ain’t around
Clowns vanish on the spot
Ain’t that nad, nigga where
Were you when I needed you?
Spend a simple G or 2, scared I see the greed in you
Should have been about this moment
I came out with my camera in hand
But I doubt it, stay the same
What about it, caron change

What would you do, if you were me?
And I was you

Hard to trust a soul now, too many are false
Disappear drama go down, karma do the waltz
Dancing around the issues, forget you, bounce
Tata, adios, au revoir, nigga be out
Know you wanna skate from the quick escape
Plan to dip anyway, go hide your face
Hold it nigga wait, enemy at gate, gon' take my plate then run away
It’s the way of the world, carry weight of the world
Haters hate, lovers love, you get a form of it for sure
I should have known it occur, when we were so-called "friends"
Dynasty, minus me, nap troop
Shining the end
I’m gonna get you, hug you, kiss you, fuck you
If you think I miss you, can’t mess with you in the fake love
Karma see the bitch in you

If you were me, and I was you

Tomorrow not promised us, yesterday the past
Ain’t no future in your fronting dog, how long can it last?
All I ask is a hundred yo, such an easy task
To be real, just to be real before I put you on blast
Niggas so fake, sneaks, thieves and snakes, I see they hate from miles away
Bullshit that left behind, bad frowns become smiles in front of fakes
Funny way, they display, they emotion like a bitch
They devotion like a snitch, they approaching with a kiss
Put the dagger in your back, good thing I'm prepared for this
So much deeper than the rap, only facts I see exist
Y’all so selfish, can’t help but shelf with your devilish intent
Fellowship extend from brotherhood exempt

What would you do, if you were me?
And I was you
