Oh, feelings, feelings, feelings

Life’s a bitch then we die
That’s why we get high
Sit by the 9 to 5 welcome to night sky
But 5 only then lie don’t ...want it
Escape from the every day, will help me meditate
Levitate, get it straight
Problems of the day, you only escalate
I just catch a faith without through the yay
To the face, suicide, stay the hung over
Do or die, chase harder if it’s done harder
To Pluto migrate, try to keep the guns holstered
With the gun in it, instead dump in it
Into my skull, till the pain numb, dull senses
Pulse flenches, think I wanna live
So I give all ten to my order, to get older
Pain that I caused her, aboarding ...daughter
Father forgive my faulters
Only human, but tonight I’m flying with these saucers

[Hook] x 2
It’s like ecstasy baby, you driving me baby
Body is jonesing, the vision is hazy
The feeling it bring me
To level the hallucinate...
Hangover over you, do it again
I’ma do it again

I’m a man with needs, for body fleeted if it please you
Pleasure you need to, let me feed you
Fiending I fiend too, the next woman on
Right or wrong, we’re too grown for this pre school
Thug of war, fuck a whore, ...she tease you
Got on my knees to ensure you with me
I’m more, never my bitch, my queen what could it keep you
Safe from my devilish ways I know I’m evil
There’s still good in me
Said you would and you could
But couldn’t look me in the eyes
Without the lies memory
My mind simply invented desire
Fed up with all the talk are you too tired
Realize you, keep them happy
And he stay disappointed in me
Straight this could say
I’m selfish in ways human nature
One morning wake up like
What I’m creeping for
Cause shit was good just a week ago

It’s like ecstasy baby, you driving me baby
Body is jonesing, the vision is hazy
The feeling it bring me
To level the hallucinate...
Hangover over you, do it again
I’ma do it again

I rep my city smoking billy wanga
Warm vodka, in war with the war ...
Progression is my only motto
Killing slow, let my mind wonder and ponder
Green dollars, from fort green to 4 colors
I got the mental force of mid scholars
These ...will ...cowards
My click’s covered in...
Puffing on a pound of sour
Devastate and devour
Get the digits ...I heard the got that pussy power
A little louder
Then it happens rapper big mouth
I move mountains and go shoes shopping
Jordan Carolina blues popping, yeah, and I got them
Her face reveals the greatest story never told
Faith can only fly next to glory...
