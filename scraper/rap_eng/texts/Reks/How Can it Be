[Intro]
"Let me stay with you, 'til the morning" (Yeah)
"Wakes the night" (R.E.K.S.)
"Just one more night with you (Statik Selektah)
"To help me, see the light" (Oh, this 'bout to be a problem)
Let's go!

[Hook]
How can it be so wrong?
(They call me Reks)
Back for the streets
When it feels so right
"Hard streets, hard times, beats and hard rhymes" - Jadakiss 'Hip Hop (Remix)'
"You know exactly who these streets belong to" - Memphis Bleek 'My Mind Right (Remix)'
How can it be so wrong?
"You better watch this cat" - Memphis Bleek 'My Mind Right (Remix)'
When it feels so right
"Yes, they say I'm an MC's MC"
"I'ma make you understand why I do what I do" - Memphis Bleek 'My Mind Right (Remix)'

[Verse One]
Ayo, the east need they king back so I came to be that
Checkmate the game like chess, I came to seize rap
Never been a name like Reks, best believe dat
Wherever I aim my best, I plant a seed at
I see that
The game has changed but I'm prepared for change
Fans can relax, I won't relapse
This ain't Rekless, and with that said, where the heat at?
Nas said, "Hip hop is dead", they bringin' me back
Like Christ on the third
With the words I'm a throwback
The flows that are picturesque as Kodak
First out the arena like a gladiator
Gettin' at a hater
We the makers of the major moves without the major paper
Quiet as kept, I crept back in
Back flippin' off the roof, a suicide sentence
How do you define 'menace' without mentionin' Reks is a fallacy
Any before me, done, won't fear none after me
That's Genesis
Revelation enemy associate
Whoever get the premonition to fuck with me is over with
It's over for soldiers
Had a nice run but I'm back like spines to remind y'all who the true chosen is

[Verse Two]
Ayo, I think I can, no, no I know I can
No need to hold my hand
I got's the upper hand, I am
Son Of Sam Berkowitz
Merciless, rap verbalist
Right on cloud nine to penetrate the Earth with it
Demonstrate superb like verses
You need services?
Ghostwrite your CD if P. Diddy purchases
Hotter than a credited street journalist
Speak murderous bars that cause onslaught to y'all nervousness
Statik, I got beef with your beat
Came to murder it
Rappers got cred on the street, but ain't deservin' it
Sick of all this hip hop beef and fake murderers
Thug claimin', drug slangin', gun bangin' worshipers
2/3 of it ain't real
Peace to third who still
Keep it authentic with a raw feel
The game need a change and my aim to deliver
Until I claim my spot in hip hop's hall of fame

[Verse Three]
I think if Pac or Big Poppa was poppin' they poetry, niggas wouldn't eat
Wouldn't be so many rappers killin' on every beat
Wouldn't be so much division 'tween the west and east
Rest in peace
To Punisher, Big L, Eazy E
To MC mean to carry the torch
Guess I be, livin' proof to Stack Bundle before I D.I.E
We can drink, write songs, get lit like Bob Marley
Hope rap won't be held against me when God call me
R.E.K.S. is prolly the Marcus Garvey of artistry
Warring with leaders to get my people out of poverty
Do the knowledge, too many artists is slaughtering all the speak
History of rap is packed into my arteries
R.E.K.S
The underground, legendary
Beep, beep, hurry, hurry, MC's need to worry
You in the booth, you best beware
Cause I solemnly swear to be a problem this year
