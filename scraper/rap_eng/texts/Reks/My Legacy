[Verse]:
Ghetto vernacular
Spectacular rapper who made it out miraculous
Edo was rappin' to us about having To Have It
Had us thinkin' Mass niggas next
That nigga Reks baby bee sting, minor buzz
Henny cup plus cigarettes, spit iller text
Destiny, unfulfilled as of yet
Legacy, self fulfilled if not thee
At least one of the best
He's so slept upon
The futon of pen and palms
Kept tellin' moms when I get on
Blow up
You're goin' cross seas, all these expenses paid for
Pray for the day y'all wake yo ass up
Who needs a major?
Take a pay cut, flluck did dat
Me and Stat diddy to rap what crack to New Jack City
Blew my back carryin' the mac with me
Ask Spitty how many pads did he see Corey smash in these
30 some years
The fate of Mass's state in my track's place
They have great expectations
For the great ones with patience
I went from Along Came for y'all pain
I wrote Suicidal Thoughts for the game
Hoping you Pray For Me
Gratefully accepted the role of Honest Abe
You see, it's my job to get 'em up up
Outta this slavery
When you deliver 16's
Aimlessly, somebody's 16's aim to be
From point A to Z, ain't a flash
They ain't see
For every Wayne there's a true life wasted G
Quick cash
Wait and see
You get the luster's of my legacy
