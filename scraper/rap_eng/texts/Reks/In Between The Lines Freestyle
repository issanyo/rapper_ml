[Verse]:
Yo in between the lines I seek, the rhyme in me
The metaphor, simile symmetry
Memories fade but what I place on page
Forever Be like a Common LP
Momma healthy, I thank above me
Thanks to all who helped me relieve stress
By letting my fingers press
In between the parallel lines before sex
Influence, drugs, alcohol and such
Basketball was lust, first until I scribbled a verse
See I, dribble and scribble the words to impress
All the girls with the yes yes y'allin'
Reks Lawrence
Massachusetts, who's this callin'?
Well hello success, yes I want ya
Excuse me Doug E. Fresh, can I get on quick?
Uh uh, on quick, uh uh on quick
Shawty on dick you can tell them haters to get off it
Up north, cold Jack Frost shit
Throw back, ball spit
Better with letters ain't gotta floss it
Through drops I'm waterfall faucet
What about y'all shit?
Bullshit, soft shit
Man I don't like they shit, just toss it
In the toilet, flush it, cause it
To get lost cause the trigger off safety, aww shit
My tongue lick off, just like bullets if you pull it
Y'all like Kanye's mullet...frosted

Yeah, see this is in between the lines y'all
You see you read between the lines and you see the mind
