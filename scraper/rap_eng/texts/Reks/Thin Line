.. think about the liquor store ..
Got me on age ..
Niggers wasn’t here when my pops died ..
Wondering if I am gonna die of .. back to his grave
.. rebellious days let the .. days .. college degree
.. gonna make a history
Chorus
Thin line
Hate and love all the time
This is how it goes
Claiming you are a friend of me
You are really and enemy
(repeats)
.. first we love then we show love to anarchy
.. over sex money and lie
.. don’t be mad at … swallows movements ..
Compared nothing to the show of .. we are living it giving it to the lifes you are listening
Chorus
