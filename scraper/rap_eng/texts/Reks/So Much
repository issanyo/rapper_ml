[Intro:]
Yeah Yeah for all the lovers out there
Beware

[Chorus:]
I say it hurts so much fuck you bitch look what you did to us
Three shots to numb the pain four bottles without a can
Fuck you I love you so much
This love it means so much to me
Said I don't know what you want this love to be
Yeah Yeah fuck you i love you so much

[Verse 1:]
Believe me your honor I needed they mama
But she was also fuck you with as bad beat persona
High blood pressure don't need the drama
So be so we could move on from wedding bells to divorce yo
Stuck in hell heaven will cost yo
Eyes watching the ultimate father
Father forgive that walk down the alter
If I could just alter the little things
See the little things sorta force you into a corner
Into the causing of death to this union
Bye bye goner
Ta ta to who I love, no more cuts
Mi amour suppose to me more (suppose to me more)
So much more (So much more)
On our love (On our love)
Close the door (Close the door)
I implore (I implore)
Cause love it gets hard

[Chorus]

[Verse 2:]
I love you so much that it hurts
I got a blunt full of herb on the verge of an heart attack
Sounded drunk on the verse but never been as big as I am now
You always held this man down
Novacane trying to numb the pain where do we stand now
If you hot and cold with your guard up
Hands down cause i'm the one to blame for yo pain and the hurt that I served
Now I’m trying to heal the wounds but the tables have turned
Why didn’t I see this before but now it seems i'm too late
Trying to make peace in a war ugh
My heart’s worn on my sleeve as blood leaps to the floor
I couldn't believe you would leave
I was a fucking fool
And you don't know what this love means to me
But it doesn't seems to mean too much to you
I know he’s trying to take whats mine but fuck him too
We got history together my love is  true

[Chorus]
