Don't need em Shawn bell
The kingdom for the..whole thing and is some thing
The boy T..separated we are voice feeling..against me
Destroy the voice and the voice got to..

Shopping is approach 'cause he don't even wanna get smoke
Blind I see illegal like I see hope
See the money to make and oversee the cope
Nobody wanna be the cocaine broke
But it see it all
Can see the traps in the big fall
See the back hit wall
See the blackness
See your mirror, see the slave masters
See the younger ones hustle back with see the pigs hard
You out the crib and the cross yang yang
Man handling your baby tell the B come

Doors a hoe mean another soul on
Ice gets tight the risk till it
An open palm brother ..my advice yeah baby
