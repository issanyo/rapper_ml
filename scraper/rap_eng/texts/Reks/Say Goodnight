[Produced by DJ Premier]

[Intro: Reks]
Premo
Reks
Long time coming
Listen!

[Verse 1]
I think they want the new P.E. now
Ice Cube, Nigga With An Attitude now
They want a dude who's immune to the rules
Short fuse, aiming at Q, Bishop on the roof now
They want me to say; Fuck who in the game
If you the best rapper alive, then Reks insane
I think Preme's insane, best producer alive
Me up on his track is like needles to the veins
Like burners to the brain, suicide chess, playing suicide king
My aim when I came was to bring back the Gang Starr audio reign
No longer R-E-K-S, it's R-E-Cocaine
Y'all on the way out, Reks on the way in
East Coast boom bap, PM to the AM
Opinion on my rap, delivery propane
Rhythmatic, eternal king, supreme, remember the name - REKS

[Scratches: DJ Premier]
("Say goodnight")
("Drop the mic, you shouldn't be holding it
This is how it should be done")
("Dropping bows on 'em
I like to catch them while they slippin'")
("Say goodnight")
("Drop the mic, you shouldn't be holding it
This is how it should be done")
("I'm serious, man, I'm so sincere")

[Verse 2]
Rock-a-bye, pop rapper to sleep, heavenly conscious
Melodies monstrous, R's one hell of an artist
Syllable dart smith, lyrical bars pimp caution
Beware of close proximity cause conflicts
Even through all this garbage nonsense, media sponsors
I'm gonna spit the raw shit regardless
My thoughts in cockpits, steering passengers through the darkness
While nerds be writing blurbs in office
I am return of the legendary, duck through the cemetery
Soul of the GOATs in my bones, so I never worry
UHH, I think they want the new Makaveli
I can really feel the pains and the strains to my belly
Hunger gettin' deadly, ain't a killer, don't tempt me
Fill the booth 'cause the youth mental fridge on empty
Opinion on my rap, the flow's ether, the soulseeker
Born leader, R-E-K-S, remember the name

[Verse 3]
Yeah, I think I wanna kill Bill O'Reilly
187 G-Dub, peel wheels on Denalis
Mommy, I'm sorry, but when these dudes rap
I be thinkin' that I should pull a Shyne in the party
Nickel nine in the audience of weak rap shows
I never needed guns, but as my stress grows
Need that East swag back, a new West Coast
80 percent of the new South rap shit blows
Now the Midwest shinin', respect their grindin'
But turn up my face to bullshit rap whinin'
UHH, say goodnight to the industry, DJ Premier sentenced me
To prepare something lethal for the ears
Here it is for the people, compare me to no other artist
I swear no equals, I hear their public opinion
On my rap, say the future of the game
Top 10 D.O.A. - Reks, remember the name
