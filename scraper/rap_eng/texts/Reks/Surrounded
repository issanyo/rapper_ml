[Chorus: Reks & EzDread]
I'm surrounded by the down and out
People and places, where do we go now?
I'm surrounded by the down and out
People and places, where do we go now?

[Verse 1: Reks]
A block away from hell
Couple blocks away from where the [?] dwell
Summers feel so sick sizzling
Hope folks listening, inform your child-e-ren
Ain't no [?], skipping on bricks
Winos sipping on licks, fine hoes living on tricks
Mama knows best, better mind yo' business
Where the five-Os ain't shit, clacking shackles on your wrist
Try to resist and it's whoop whoop whoop whoop up in this bitch
Jump in a fits, cut through alleyway, attempt to dip
'Cause they equipped to hit you with the burner and the murder
In a place you never been, a victim never heard of
Cycle will never end, everybody desert ya
What happened to your friends, no pity party for ya
Surrounded by the down and out, finally you finding out
The people and places, the evil the replaces
The smile on their faces turned upside down

[Chorus: Reks & EzDread]
I'm surrounded by the down and out
People and places, where do we go now?
I'm surrounded by the down and out
People and places, where do we go now?

[Verse 2: Dutch ReBelle]
I feel surrounded by the silence
Standing in the middle of the crowd with the mindless
Tryna keep my thought from getting loud while the blindest
Always tryna lead, my type of beast just depending on what you feed me
Rebelle that revolution fresher than virgins douching
Taught that once you get fresh air is how you spot pollution
I been executing all of the exorcisms
With my lyricism competing with cynicism
I get it I mean I guess hear them say they stressed
Swear that word ain't nothing but a pharmacy connect
Bunch of folks taking legal dope crumble in a sec
Ain't got the Kevin Heart to come and say it with they chest, yes
Not a pacifist, I'm a passionist
Going out for all of my beliefs while I'm rolling leaf
Tryna get away from all the grief while you suck your teeth
Need the green to circle like a wreath I'm in disbelief

[Chorus: Reks & EzDread]
I'm surrounded by the down and out
People and places, where do we go now?
I'm surrounded by the down and out
People and places, where do we go now?

[Verse 3: Alias]
My circumference like sickle cell
Stop in my flow in this living hell
See me no getting out
Surrounded by sickening doubt
The hate is so swarming
It ain't normal, the shit ain't worth it
Real heads screaming false worship, come one now
That domino effect and we can't fall down
The Devil's all around, huh, he waiting for us
Slipping's what he wanted to hold a false promise
Only take a match to burn down a whole forest
So get it right, one strike could take out all of us
Ignite the followers, leaders, fireproof
We perspire in the booth to help you try to find the truth
Ain't an easy job but it's something that we gotta do
Someone lie to you, left 'em dumbfounded
Confused, head pounding, hard to stay grounded
Tears of a lonely man and still feel surrounded

[Chorus: Reks & EzDread]
I'm surrounded by the down and out
People and places, where do we go now?
I'm surrounded by the down and out
People and places, where do we go now?
