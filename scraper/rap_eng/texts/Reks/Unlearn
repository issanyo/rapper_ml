[Verse 1: Reks]
Mine eyes seen the coming of seduction
Discussing who to trust in the clutch and
Nobody worthy in the world we know
Burning them ashes past fingertips
The final drips in a glass I sip
The inhibition of class is split
The have and have not, the have not rot
The haves benefit 'til we drop
Picking crops of cotton and then forgotten
On blocks with sounds of gun shots
Alarm clocks, how does it stop?
Limited option, liberty or death
Branded the flesh like he was cattle
We're equivalent, just imagination babble
This generation lacks
True knowledge of how the past has trapped you
With psychological lassos over Adam's apples
Soldiers blast through fitted caps
To wear them glory flags do not democracy make
Militant asshole I rap so my mind's free
And read to feed my seeds
Believe the lesson was heard, the third eye sees

[Hook x2: Reks]
Fuck what you heard, forget what you knew
Its time to unlearn, system reboot
Telling you the truth, or is it lies
Claiming its the truth, but are they lies?

[Verse 2: Reks]
Keep letting them folks lie to me
Dying to be, a part of their cult
Or say fuck 'em all, stand and revolt
Leader? the Pope says you have a better chance at the pearly gates
For a minimal fee, he's cleaning a dirty slate
For worthy angst, Picasso paints a white Jesus
Black is evil I guess, that's how elite sees us
Can't hail Ceasars, need somebody for us non-believers
See I ain't racist
But Apollo Creed and Mr. T is
Just not enough heroes, to make us not feel like zeros
My school ain't have no Langston Hughes murals
No Medgar Evers paragraphs
No conversations on the Willie Lynch theory in my history class
Ya'll could laugh, at Honeymooners and the Happy Days
Shit is not amusing, no black neighbors
If moved in, the house value depreciate
Show ratings decline
Gotta un-see, be not blind...

[Hook x2: Reks]

[Verse 3: Reks]
All the power hungry money control the atlas
Fighting for space before time elapses
Comfort zone collapses, a home captured
To say we care is ass backwards
Selfish in nature, just pure facts kid
This last verse is for my sons to heed
Cause when my son's in need
Upon a bleeding heart they love to feed
Kick you when you down, witnesses they're up in here
So I apologize to you now for being sons of man
Evil incarnate monsters stand, without a code of ethics
The road is set with traps, to leave us desperate
A call for help is never met with effort
Minus a motive, violence explodes with the force of atomic
Focused on Hiroshima, we voted for peace and got a piece of they're land
Divide us foes, we are damned
If we do, if we don't, we not American fam
Into this world I brought you, see what I taught you
Decide, either lion or lamb
