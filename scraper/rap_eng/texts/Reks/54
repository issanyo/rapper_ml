[Verse 1: Reks]
Glorious salutations and hellos
In other words peace to my [?] fellows
Been a lot of ups and downs in the ghettos
Smiles and frowns maneuver through the pounds
Not the loud or the pistols, talking about crowds up inc Bristol
Skyping with my kids did he miss you
Wish I could be there to hug and kiss you
Distance the issue, relentless the grizzle
AKA grind shake and bake time
Cooked a classic, wake 'em up time-starved bust capper
Chino Vinnie style
Pen be mad superior to inferior literature child
Of the Christian Parker school of art
The shout to the missing martyrs fought for all us
Beautiful parlors with the [?] joggin' from the noggin
Father MC, the father him see
To God be the glory, spoils to the victor
Off the chain the scale the Richtor
Mr. glass, meet the pain inflictor
Cross out your name, add me to the list of
Quiet storm that formed in the lips like whispers
Grow to a venomous growl
My signature wild wild
It's a glamorous markish style
You punk bitch often, I'm in a loft with the pen
Upper class senior whip ass with the phlegm
Ahem ahem, lozenges for the carpenters
Master craftsmen, swift pat as if this is aspen motion
Picture closed caption
In the zone adaptin'
To the habitat, battlefield battlecat
Tongue like a thunderclap
On my J-O-B, number jack like 1-0-1 I might
You bow wow, nigga bow down
Rhythmatic Eternal King supreme
Need jewels for the crown, you fool simmer down
As I sizzle saute, Hazardis Soundz all day
Flawless flow my forte, all my vocay
Son son, vocab, gift of gab, O'Shea
Talking Cube not the cousin Dede
Verbal AK machine gun tongue make 'em lean like the fiend go dumb
Bag a skunk, cream in your shorty bunk
You will all succumb
To the word perfect sort of verses
Make you think of funeral service
Rest in peace to you bitch ass MCs
Eyes Watching God got you niggas nervous
Word up
