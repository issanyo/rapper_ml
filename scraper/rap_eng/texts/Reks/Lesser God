[Verse 1: Reks]
We are children of a lesser god
Lessons of generation lost are at war with the political state
Some are bitter, some will hate
In the slums some will make
Best of living in conditions with minimal space
Literal waste of an existence, dead eyes yearning for pearly gates
Murder rate tripling crippling faith
Kids be on them skates in police chases
To face judge its bugged
Fuck a cell, rather be dug
To clutch hells grips
Selfish to sell this or is we helpless
Health is dwindling minute by minute, you ever felt if
They dealt us cards with some better odds
We'd gel with the society's laws
We are beyond pawns
We are peons in devil's palms
We are clinged on by eagles talons, the power belong
To them, ahem,  come sing Along
Come the chosen one, one love to morning sun

[Hook 1: Reks (Ming)]
Do your eyes see (do your eyes see)
What my eyes see (what my eyes see)
We are children of a lesser god
Testify R-E

[Hook 2: Ming]
Testify what my eyes have seen
To enlighten you and you and you
My eyes have seen your dreams
Keep sight in view of you

[Verse 2: Reks]
Im trying to ride these beats 'til their last minutes
When this rap's finished
Wall taggers, back spinners
Hope your back in it, I pack sentence into the pad, pennin' it
Tentaments, stacks of raps when it's
My turn, I yearn
Catch timid, rap niggas with they wack image
I'm all vintage and authentic
As real as the realest gorillas
Lion cold killers, yo niggas
No triggers or dome peelers
My poems (uh-huh) spill and fill up songs could care less
What ya'll fairy's hold I am not scared of
Them spoken jabs I am holding raps
Packed with the napalm ether
The grim reaper pen leak upon a sheet deeper
Thoughts over your caesar bald head or knotty dread
Peep what the Lord said
Thou shall not keep us
Listenin' to this bullish, a full clip
In the pen from the pulpit
Are you yearnin'

[Hook 1: Reks (Ming)]
Do your eyes see (do your eyes see)
What my eyes see (what my eyes see)
We are children of a lesser god
Testify R-E

[Hook 2: Ming]
Testify what my eyes have seen
To enlighten you and you and you
My eyes have seen your dreams
Keep sight in view of you
