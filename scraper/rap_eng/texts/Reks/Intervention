[Intro: Reks]
Yo Marcus D, wuddup. Ya boy Reks. These them interventions. Sometimes it's need you know? Let's go

[Verse 1: Justis]
Now let me break it down, cause see it's complicated
Reality my mentality is I gotta make it
It's like I'm obligated, even if I'm not the greatest
They gon have to write about me next to Pac in pages
Immortalized in time like I was shot in Vegas
"All eyes on me" like you're watching surveillance
Might claim that my mind frame's sideways
24/7 means working on your Fridays
No time for kicking back, not slipping but it's slick where I'm at
Gum bottom got em ten toes down, feet upon the ground
Head above clouds, rock shows where the hate is not allowed
Saying money talks and the paper's so loud, focused
While you playing games with your tokens
I'll take it from the bottom to the top like I'm floating

[Hook: Jennifer Newberry]
If I don't watch it, I might catch it
If we don't make it, where we gon go?
If you don't do what you know to do
Then who gon do what we need you to?
If I don't watch it, I might catch it
If we don't make it, where we gon go?
If you don't do what you know to do
Then who gon do what we need you to?

[Verse 2: Reks]
The words of people sting, on eagle's wings
I can fly past the gossip of this rap thing Louis Gosset
Junior's progress all that keep my mind busy, i rhyme dizzy
Your crime really, you're not with me
In this zone, this booth I call home
The youth I call the future trying to help em dream, M. Luther
King rulers I drop jewels for noggin users
Intervening this rap thing I bring the truth to
Non­believers my nom de plume art at E cause
The rhythm is eternal, dawg my journal reaches
Miami beaches, reflect with Mediterranean Sea is how to seize
This opportunity to school the heaters
The listeners to free the prisoners defeat is not an option
And I'm talking to the down­and­out bottom feeders
Fight the system, write your destiny my intuition tell me somebody change past
Interventions

If I don't watch it, I might catch it
If we don't make it, where we gon go?
If you don't do what you know to do
Then who gon do what we need you to?
If I don't watch it, I might catch it
If we don't make it, where we gon go?
If you don't do what you know to do
Then who gon do what we need you to?
