[Intro:]
Take a second to  talk about snakes, man
Slithering around and shit

[Verse 1:]
What's love got to do with it
Word to Tina
Your own team will leave ya hangin from the popeless
Kick the chair, roped up
Tied aroun the throat
Pump 40 in your gut
Audiences love witnessing your downfall
Fake fags, snakes
They bail ya only for tha [?]
Hoping to scrape crumbs offa tha plate
Hey listen, I ain't bitchin
Just mentionin the snakes slithering
[?]
Killer gets women in shark waters
A dark feelin in your belly, awful thoughts of
Cuttin em off, would you let them tag along
Addin on to the stress level, the saddest song
Had your palms open and open arms when you need no response
When you bleed they be gone
The strong let loose losers
Who abuse the truth in your ways
Poison in the air, the venom in the veins, snakes

[Chorus:]
Look em in the eyes you see snakes
Keep shootin to the sky, it's okay
Got my thirty open on a nigga
Focused on the picture
Snake, this is snake slither [x2]

[Verse 2:]
Smiling faces, high evil traces
Facetious, racist, misogynistic haters
With you on capers
Get caught in snitch, wanna break us
Cause they don’t wanna wake up
Gettin time, caged up
Got my mind made up
Jewels a la Jacob
Fools wanna take up, my time
Hate up, my mind make ya envious playa
Enemies say a praya
God bless
May I rest under 6 layers
I wish greater success cater to ya
Paid tha dues to, get use to life’s spoils
And your blood boils, jealous above all
We supposed to be boys
But no dog, you living foul
Back in the mix, I ain't see you in a while dog
But I'm aware, recognize strange
Poison in the air, venom the veins

[Chorus]

[Verse 3:]
This ain’t a new concept,  just one without progress
Too much our time spent dealing with monsters
Jungle is harsh it’s the sweetest cigar tips
I’m in the slam with the homies my spit
Your nonsense got me on edge
Let me toss this bond shit off the roof top
Bitch I’m styles fresh and bound to drop
Cause too many gets too  friendly when you got
Too vicious when you not, on top [?]
Escape, disappear there toasting up 2 shots
Like he was just here, pull the 2pac
My vision clear, nigga do not pretend to befriend
[?] only for the 2 props
Cause in the end, it's all that you got
Yourself and the heaven
The reverend talk over casquette that drop
More to lose in life than to gain
Poison in the air, venom in the veins

[Chorus]
