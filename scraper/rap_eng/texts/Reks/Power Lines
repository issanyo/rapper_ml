[Sample]:
Now people try to tell us
But we are too young to know now

[Verse One] [Reks]:
Misguided, misinformed
Miss-educated, huh?
Our population gone outta control long
Before the company of misery, miscellaneous storms
Miss America, misinterpreted, end up in poem
Pussy poppin', black girl lost, from
Mysterious missus body found missing
Nobody miss her in the morn'
Degraded, decomposed, desensitized to time
Detective dealin' with dealers behind yellow lines
That taped off
Chalk outline that lies beauty personified
Candles and vigils, child an issue hearin' momma cry
Each time a child born somebody dies
A suicide, a homicide, it's do or die wherever ghetto problems rise
They say you too young to understand
Troubles of your brother man
Struggles of your sisters in the gutter fam
Don't let 'em misrepresent, deny your intelligence
Defy the elements
Deceit merely evident

[Hook]:
Many will come, many will go
All I know
Many will rise, many below, truth be told
We got the power and it goes
"I Got the Power" - Snap
You, you, you, you got the power
Many will come, many will go
All I know
Many will rise, many below, truth be told
We got the power and it goes
"I Got the Power" - Snap
You, you, you, you got the power

[Verse Two] [Reks]:
Fuck the presence of presidents
System setting us up for failure
Governor, senator, evil elements
May negligence to your needs of the people
Divide and equal, decide a sequel
Upper class give hesitance
We do not need to be walkin' blind, peep warnin' sign
Invest in company, money managed by mornin' time
The corner crime is parallel to recession
9 to 5, lessons build aggression, we need walls to climb
There's no democracy, obvious in your policy
Poverty, put in prison, paper chase, honestly
No oxygen to breath
No baby momma wanted seeds to be raised in these times
Of dire needs
Eyes bleed from the visions
Viscous divisions
No minute to listen, seconds steadily tickin'
Pissin' in elevators and spittin' in lawyer faces
Got the power
Eyes wide in rebellion stages

[Hook]:
Many will come, many will go
All I know
Many will rise, many below, truth be told
We got the power and it goes
"I Got the Power" - Snap
You, you, you, you got the power
Many will come, many will go
All I know
Many will rise, many below, truth be told
We got the power and it goes
"I Got the Power" - Snap
You, you, you, you got the power

[Verse Three] [Ea$y Money]:
We live in a cold world where nobody send a positive mess-age
That's why it's such a mess in this age
Nothin' changed but the season
We come, to learn that he who think you get freedom for free is dumb
And my dawgs is, lawless
Cause they charge us, hundreds of dollars
Just so our sons can be ballers
Meanwhile them same dicks that enforce the laws is
Drivin' round town in they brand new Chargers
We just can't afford this
So we movin' all this
Rawness, and our daughters strip to pay for college
Raised with no fathers
Catchin' charges, just makin' it harder for employers to employ us
But, this is my life
If I control my destiny
So it's up to me to bring out the best in me
Let these words penetrate your mind
Elevate your mind
Escalate the grind, get your hands high
Say, "I, I, I, I got the power, power."
You, you, you, you got the power, power
We, we, we, we got the power
"I Got The Power"
So let's live our lives as if we in the final hour

[Hook]:
Many will come, many will go
All I know
Many will rise, many below, truth be told
We got the power and it goes
"I Got the Power" - Snap
You, you, you, you got the power
Many will come, many will go
All I know
Many will rise, many below, truth be told
We got the power and it goes
"I Got the Power" - Snap
You, you, you, you got the power
