[Verse 1]
Ahem, clear phlegm, commence to air dem
Gems dem jewellery, keep all buffoonery
Away from him, ten porch monkeys dancing for the big boss
I ain't gon' say their names I'mma let y'all
Be the blind niggas leading blind niggas into them
Flame James Brown, black prayer, fuck James
Better duck, see my man before he ready to kill again
Palin and McCain, Herman Cain murder on the brain
How come the cops who shot Diallo were were arraigned?
Strange Music with a Tech N9ne, turn the crime scene
I seen violence lean, probably green, probably rule the all
Devilish balls from heaven, (?) Hell is hard
Did they mistake us for Waco, Texas?
David Koresh in flesh, this a culture not a cult
'80s to the '90s where they find me on revolt
Now a nigga think he god because no fork on pork
Motherfuckers better to die, what's live for?
I don't live for USA, hear me I die for the theory
Where liberty is liberty, so if I sense an enemy
I click clack back, turn his soul into a memory

[Hook] x2
I pledge, no allegiance to no flags
These streets coloured with rags
Felt blues or the bloodshed
My country, 'tis of thee

[Verse 2]
Little schoolboy, hand on his heart
Pledge allegiance for the bloodshed and wars we fought
Caught a glimpse of the victims, the afterthoughts
Post traumatic, the syndrome, sleeping in parks
Little ghetto boy, hand on his Glock
Cocked back for his rag just playing his part
Taught, aim for the head, not the leg, you got
To blow the top off, pop off, better be sure
You leave no trace for them to know your face
For them to go so ape, then spraying up your place
Revenge got a raw taste, aw wait, baby in the crib hit
Baby in the rib, now baby can't live, baby dead, baby get wet up
Results with niggas fed up, tears at wakes
I pray you keep your head up
Dead up, or dear god, you dying your all for colour schemes
All a dream to get the CREAM, boss
Laws, fuck the cost to floss
The glitter, the gloss
The bigger the voice, the bigger the choice (Salute!)
Concerned for em, learnin' em
Revolutionary's necessary, and your flag's we burnin' 'em

[Hook] x2
