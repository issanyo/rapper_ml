[Verse 1: Reks]
Beat bully bogart
The booth with the flow darts
Name synonymous with Shakespeare, Mozart
Cape Fear go hard, villain with the pencilling
Not a pot to piss in and I'm sick, where the insulin?
Pay attention and you ain't got to get hurt
Backslap your smirk, yanked out of your shirt
Raps back you jerk, thanks Mr. Lamar
Reks enter the bar, hangover tomorr'
Ding-a-ling swing so far down her jaw
It be ticklin' the belly from her insides ya'll
Arrogant well yes-I-R
Cause I'm in category 1 of 1, best of best with the thoughts
Confess I impress to a fault
See with nothing left to exalt the love affair halt
The hatin' then commence, apron on the hips
I be baking up the hits, movin' up the list
Cookin' up the classics, Betty Crocker bitch
Yeah he talkin' shit back it up like the Pips
On a midnight train the brain ignite memories
Of pain, paint murals in the rain
Rhythmatic, the King

[Hook: Reks]
I bet you think you know about bars
About similes and metaphors
Hope the voice is compelling for the art of storytellin'
Please hold your applause

[Verse 2: Reks]
I been the D-ON for eons, studying the sci-ence
Math and the literature, R-E-King supreme one
Sorry to demean dumb
Niggas, but you dumb niggas lean on
The wrong understanding, my green thumb
Plant seeds in new breeds to heed, uh
Each one teach one, knowledge proceed
I bleed from artery with heart on my sleeve
Believe the culture been devoured by these vultures of greed
So I don't need none
Of your approval, I'm approvin' myself
In booth with myself as motivation holdin' the belt
Most lyrical to have his joint still on the shelf
I spill on the book, leave 'em shook
Earthquake felt, the words they will
Force dudes to take they L
Take they O, take they S
Then another S, brother Reks discover the best kept secretive
Ascap need to just keep the check repeat-itive
Repetitive, whatever bitch
I'm better with putting the letters together shit
And you don't stop rockin' wit'
This showin' off with the spit
So long to the next eulogy I got a script
No more, that's all that's it, bitch

[Hook: Reks]
I bet you think you know about bars
About similes and metaphors
Hope the voice is compelling for the art of storytellin'
Please hold your applause
