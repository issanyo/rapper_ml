Pour out a bottle of Rose
Pour out a bottle of Rose
Pour out a bottle of Rose
'Cause you dead to me now
Pour out a bottle of Rose
Pour out a bottle of Rose
Pour out a bottle of Rose
'Cause you dead to me now

[Verse 1: Termanology]
I can't wait to get rich and give you nothing
I hope you starve to death, die spitting up blood
And throw up your own heart in front of your grandmom
I used to fuck with you but now I ain't involved
I used to be foolish jump in front of a bullet for you
Was the tunnel vision blocking my view
All I think about now is my daughters
And what school I'ma put 'em in
So if I gotta shoot you I'ma do you in
I be in the crib leanin' Henny life
I got a shotty in front of my daughter's potty
So if I gotta go hop up and blast
Put you in the hospital up in the oxygen mask
Then you gone baby
I said you gone baby gone
Put the heat to your bitch like a salon
I catch you in my crib, you getting flipped on
I'm spitting on your grave and it's getting pissed on

[Hook]
Pour out a bottle of Rose
Pour out a bottle of Rose
Pour out a bottle of Rose
'Cause you dead to me now
Pour out a bottle of Rose
Pour out a bottle of Rose
Pour out a bottle of Rose
'Cause you dead to me now

[Verse 2: Reks]
Bitch-made, some niggas is fugaze
Want a razor blade barber shop top, toupees
Send your mom bouquets, talk shit to face
All love two-faced behind back trying to act
I don't need that dat, that's one hundred
Confronted, son stunted, knew in his heart of hearts
He ain't want it, haunted
With the memories of friendships
Turned long distance fuck yous
Fuck you mean this mean war?
Pour Rose, ta-ta to yesterdays
You a slave, I'm a hustler
Patience 'cause once I was
Out to snap your melon back if we knuckle up
Learn to buckle up, tell 'em kick rocks
I'm somewhere overseas, you still stuck on the block
Misery of your mirror's imagery
Lurking on your grave
Nothing you say means shit to me

[Hook]
Pour out a bottle of Rose
Pour out a bottle of Rose
Pour out a bottle of Rose
'Cause you dead to me now
Pour out a bottle of Rose
Pour out a bottle of Rose
Pour out a bottle of Rose
'Cause you dead to me now
