(Intro – x2)
Here we go, here we go
Here we, here we, here we go

(Verse 1)
Where do I start? Oh yeah, the park bench
Listening to Com’ Sense
How he used to love H.E.R. ‘til they fucked H.E.R. on some nonsense
Mom spent years trying to raise me as a doctor or a lawyer
But I opted for the all-you-can-eat buffets and rap pages
Outrageous, majors signing rhyming niggas who don’t rhyme amazing
They was not the underdog, I’m the underdog
Some of y’all was in awe, but I wasn’t in awe – I saw they flaws
Close my eyes like I’m Daddy Kane scripting Raw
Spit the authentic from jaw because
I was in the dirt when it hurt, put in work with my niggas
Remember G, Lebron and the twins holding triggers
Oh it was, real trying to get a name
Still tryin’ to chase the fame, make a lane, cop a acre, take the game
Back from the undeserved, give it to the brother R
Underground ‘til I’m under dirt, underdog

(Chorus)
Here we go, here we go
Here we, here we, here we go
All of my days, the praise, the accolades
Homecoming parades alluding me
Give it up for a true MC
R-E-K-S
(What?!) The greatest rapper no one heard about
The greatest rapper no one heard about
The greatest rapper no one heard about
Murder motherfuckers off of word-of-mouth

(Verse 2)
Yo, you see all my of life I’ve been considered as the worst
Lying to my momma, even stealing out her purse
Even worse I was, birthed in dirt, immersed and rotten
Best believe Corey was a problem
Travelled them street designs tryin’ to find a sign to read
World mine, murdered line for line at shows, climbed to those
Boston elite polls but universally nobody heard of me
The pulse (?) of me, told me I was born to be
BIG, Nas, Jay, debated, stated, I’m gassed, ego inflated
Made it my mission to silence ‘em, deaf, blind
And I’m not aided by a proper ear, what they hear from the radio
See from the video, Waka Flocka, silly flow
Underdog, killin’ those silicone fakers
I do this for the DJ, do it for the breakers
Take it from the undeserved, give it to the brother R
Underground ‘til I’m under dirt, underdog

(Verse 3)
See I believe in impossible dreams
I float on wings, I’m a dream catcher, mean rapper
Swing batter swing
For the fences, join me on adventures
Senses/census (?) tell me I’m a sentence away from the pay
The dollars and the cents is in our sight
I ignite revolution, evolution on the mic
Preparation for the hype, I am not scared of heights
I am not scared of flying, no pouting, no crying
No coward in the lion, no doubting my climbing
‘Til the skies give me mo’ like two letters beside “n”
I am him, the one, so say goodnight to them
On Cloud 9 with pen, again, phlegm flung fluid find friend, and
Speak of the blend (?), give audio orgasm, the passion to Him
Upstairs, yup we’re coming upon the end
Underground, under dirt, underdog
