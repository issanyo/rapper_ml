[Verse 1: Reks]
How do I aim, left side of the brain?
Sentence invented, a migraine
Discipline in him, the mind train
Penciling intricate lines, Sing Sing
Alcatraz bars, pause addicted to rhyme schemes
Intravenous in the vein, fiend when I design scene
Picturesque, I put to rest the best with syllable, my genes
Literal or lyrical Visine, open eyes wide clean
For ching-ching, registers ding the sound ring
Bells ala Heaven or Hell, you na'mean?
Eyes watching God I be on binoculars, zooming In
Y'all be Zooted out, no fisticuffs, niggas shoot it out
Took unruly routes for large amounts
Count the Benjamins, cut out the middle men, no doubt
You know the boss motto
Money over bitches in the plush autos
Ain't gotta cuff, she benefits, hush when we intimate, Bravo
To the winners and survivors on these long roads
Lost souls I got you

[Hook: Hazardis Soundz & Venessa Renee]
And we can see Eye 2 Eye
Arm, leg, leg, arm, head, G-O-D
Don't worry, I got you
Below the dirt or in the skies
The devil is a lie, a lie, a lie, the lie, the lie, the lie
Don't worry, I got you

[Verse 2: Reks]
And we can see clear to the heavenly skies
Devil's a lie, better believe I'mma ride, can't be denied
Eyes wide, mandatory preparation, necessary 'til I die
'Til I die I push up, sit up, lift weight
Own up to my own mistakes
Grown enough to work for my plate
Born alone, gon' end the same
Since an infant I been in pain
I pen that pain on paper in poetry
Penetrating, demonstrating, mental ventilation
I'm pacing to the tick-tock tick-tock
Waiting patient for angels halos, no hell or Satan
No elevation, congregation reading Revelations
Delegations to the pawns and peons to respond
To estimating the end of times is in the making
Better get that Good Book, kiss your rosary and pay your tithing
Cause I been reading Baldwin the Fire Next Time and
We dying, "If" and "But's" aside man
Enter then we exit nobody is sliding by, damn

[Hook: Hazardis Soundz & Venessa Renee]
And we can see Eye 2 Eye
Arm, leg, leg, arm, head, G-O-D
Don't worry, I got you
Below the dirt or in the skies
The devil is a lie, a lie, a lie, the lie, the lie, the lie
Don't worry, I got you

[Outro: Steve Biko]
We.... we see a completely non-racial society. We donâ€™t believe, for instance, in the so-called guarantees for minority rights, because guaranteeing minority rights implies the recognition of portions of the community on a race basis. We believe that in our country there shall be no minority, there shall be no majority, there shall just be people. And those people will have the same status before the law and they will have the same political rights before the law. So in a sense it will be a completely non-racial egalitarian society
