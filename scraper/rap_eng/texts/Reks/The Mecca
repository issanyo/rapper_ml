[Verse 1: Reks]
Mucho salute from the booth I'm the truth
From the golden era head to the modern-day youths
Hyping with the flu son in old or haiku
They love what I do from the old to the new
Keep it smooth ala CL, rock bells ala B
Term and Fyuz on your joint on a beat
Now we eat, used to starve even back then
Props in the yards
Elementary days, kicking my kindergarten, pause
Never been forgotten, nah, I am def, them and me
Lot of disagreements but about this music we agree
It is refreshing to see such reflecting
Rebirth of expression return to the essence
Plus it's me, adored by the truest
Abhored by the newest where swag is the waving flag
I'm global with the vocals
Just a team when Spot said kill 'em like you 'sposed to
And I did that, yep I did that
Words through the speaker, Cory keep you where my ribs at
See it's love here whereever I'm at
Daps and hugs here, Rekka out to Mecca

[Verse 2: Termanology]
I'm getting major props
Plus I'm getting paid a lot
Made a stop at the block
Got my guap and then- gone
Had a dip, had a c-note flip
My C-lo hand smooth as a Pinot Grigio sip
I see no reason to sit waiting for a fucking hand-out
Be a man, get a job, get some grands out
And please stand down if you ain't a stand out
Too many rappers and not enough fans now
But in the 9-7-8 I'm the man now
Ain't nobody can compare and that's hands down
I'm on the sand on the beach getting tan
With a drink trying come up with a Master P's plan and
I got the type of love that you can't pay for
Cause I'm a be a real one 'til the graveyard
You know the rules, we giving respect due
From the Term and Fyuz
To the Pete Rock and CL Smooth
It's love
