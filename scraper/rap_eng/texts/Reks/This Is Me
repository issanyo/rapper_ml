(Intro)

Looking at my history and what the times giving me
I’m just trying to live the type of life that was meant for me
Flaws and all, pardon y’all I don’t want to come off too timidly
Tend to be more outspoken than your typically rap imagery, rock star mimicry
Minute we get up on the charts, five minutes starts
Literally it could be your life but this is me

(Hook)

Hey, I don’t care what they say, I’m just me at the end of the day. With my flaws and all, the mirror ain’t lying y’all cause this is me (this is me) this is me (this is me) this is me, trying not to let the bullshit get to me cause this is me (this is me) this is me (this is me) I just want to live the life that was meant for me

(Verse 1)

Incubator baby bottle dead father foster home
Drunk uncle ass whooping, lot of stress wrote a song
Pouring more pain upon older pain blaming God
Blaming y’all, blaming all but (the mirror here is at fault?)
On the pillows cotton I felt forgotten on all the missed birthdays till I regret the day gone
Hate for em’ adolescent years learned about the one
Same bloodline, strange fruit them niggas hung
Segregated tailgated fit the description bail ate it
Diploma momma proud Cory graduated
The real world surely have to face it
Horny and we both wasted had to taste it
Had a girl she forgave God is good
Now we same bases places in my life
I write scattered arrangements between perforated pages
This is me, a pen, my thoughts, and parallel space it’s me

(Hook)

(Verse 2)

I done gave out my each and every did what was necessary
Cried when my heart was heavy, died when my pops was buried
Water on my cold face beat a case God helped
Illegal ducking cops there froze in a cold cell
Slumbered on that park bench rose when I found hell
Watch the Lupus in the bones hope to see moms well
Pray for my sins in it sins came in repetition
Dealt with public opinion kept my shoulder chipped up
Party hard by the bar stressed got my dick sucked
Hit the streets flip a beat pop the trunk quick buck
Apologize show fear, couple wise words shared
Rain buckets of pain believe they were tall tears
This is me at least to my peers wasted them days
Wish the lord could return years
Believe the spiritual disbelief physical
Got up in the both and bled life with the lyricals

(Hook)
