[Sample]
"I mean, who are we supposed to trust?"
"Same people we always trust
Us"

[Verse 1 - REKS]
Fuck you Mr. Politician, don't wanna listen
Nothing you plan to offer can get me out of my position
Mama still in the hospital, bed-ridden, her head spinning
Popping them painkillers, fed from a tube, listen
Don't give a fuck if you and his views are different
I'mma have to pay for my son's school tuition
Learning, he will probably use third shift in the worst condition
I sorta miss them days of Bill Clinton
Bills didn't seem to stack up to the ceiling
I find that appealing, fed up of this bullshit you dealing
Cards is at even odds, and leaving hard
And Mama, pray to Lord, keep believing in God
A facade, maybe not, but we not getting off of these blocks
Word to X, get it dark, and hell is hot, the belly pop
Ball in position, we put in hard to avoid
And the Devil knows just where to employ us

[Hook - REKS] x2
Who are you gonna trust, us or them? It's simple mathematics
Number one, public enemy, with the pen pad shit
I become the only one you can rely on
'Cus I don't lie to 'em, one hundred pure

[Verse 2 - Bishop Lamont]
Okay, election's over, four more years of nigga shit
Racist America, yeah you gotta deal with it
You don't even like the half that's white
So you really gotta hate my black ass on sight
Alright, big lip, big nose, black, I'm so proud
All over YouTube, infecting your precious child
Got little Johnny rebelling, yelling "Fuck the system!"
You wanna bargain some stock in this private prisons
'Cus niggas getting flipped like hot cakes
Legal state free, better than what that cotton made
Man, you witnessin' the legacy
The south been risen, it's that new age confederacy
Clan took off their sheets, dipped them in the tea party
You don't know? Oh boy, you better ask somebody
Enemy invisible, ring the alarm
A scene, they strike like when they hit the pentagon

[Hook]
