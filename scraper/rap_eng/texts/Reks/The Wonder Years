[Verse 1 - Reks]
I used to contemplate an escape from reality
Face the mirror state I hate you waste of space
Then chase a Henny chased by more Henny
Me and my inebriated state needed fate
Fate would have it I go on to make
Say goodnight take a flight
NY city see me in the booth where they creatin'
'Nas is like' hot as like
Take us from them drunken nights to the heights
Minus plights and minus the kids
Can't forget them Wonder Years years
Where I wonder where next meal provided decided
To try my hand again now we find Reks with Hi-tek
A gem hidden in the dirt eternally reflectin' them verse
From the worst thirst to the throat quench made no sense
To convince me I can make it there make it here make it anywhere
From Wonder Years
Yes I profess I from projects to high rise rise
All of them doubts defied now back to cloud 9

[Hook - Reks]
Cus all the days that I spent gettin' wasted
Listening to my instrumentals
I ain't had no pay for the rent
Not one red cent
Wonderin' what I'm in this game for
Cuz in gets cold be low low
Low lo lo lo lo low low low
Oh the things I've done for my meal
Thank God I made it through the Wonder Years

[Verse 2 - Reks]
Had my first taste of heaven at the age of eleven
Took a drink with the Reverend I ain't lyin'
Uncle was on the drugs
Fast forward Corey swervin' in  the fast lane
Buzzed and buggered and blacked out when the crash came
Couple bumps and bruises but fuck a scratch man
Whip's in the ditch and my wife she gon trip fam
This around the time I was flippin' petty
Nickel dime shit not by design kid
I was trippin' on the sign said dead jail or phone a friend
I was homeless and O took me in fed a nigga
Bet you niggas see me in the Beam lookin' bummy
Same jeans a week straight ain't offer a plate
Yanaamean? And it's funny how they love me now
Knew I'd always make it out pass on backs stabs abound
Simmer down fuckin' clowns on top they love you
The bottom nobody cares grey hairs now
Lookin back on Wonder Years

[Hook - Reks]
Cus all the days that I spent gettin' wasted
Listening to my instrumentals
I ain't had no pay for the rent
Not one red cent
Wonderin' what I'm in this game for
Cuz it gets cold be low low
Low lo lo lo lo low low low
Oh the things I've done for my meal
Thank God I made it through the Wonder Years

[Verse 3 - Reks]
Reks savage blessed actors forget rappers
I'm next as if I got my ticket to get package
FedEx the walking papers match make em mat marriage
Start livin' my life for wife and carriage
Daddy daycare oh yeah I change diapers
Still pencil lines that change your life up
Like the DC sniper last of the freedom writers
My vice of life the cigs and alcohol
Add up all my headaches
I said I'm in the finish havin a ball
I'm sure you Mr. Tyler now
To reference the Wila y'all
Left stage bartender holla' find a call
Gotta get my drink on
It help me get my think on
On beats I can get Talib Kweli deep on
Back to the Wonder Years
Younger kids transform our underwears
Under influence of a movement
Brewin' in the Bronx
Doin' what we want
Latch key child my past was wild
Lend me ya ears for them Wonder Years

[Hook - Reks]
Cus all the days that I spent gettin' wasted
Listening to my instrumentals
I ain't had no pay for the rent
Not one red cent
Wonderin' what I'm in this game for
Cuz in gets cold be low low
Low lo lo lo lo low low low
Oh the things I've done for my meal
Thank God I made it through the Wonder Years
