Oh what a marvelous thing my dear
To be amongst glorious stars in here
The limelight, the limelight, the limelight, the limelight
Say ta ta fading stars
Never wanna say it’s over love
The limelight, the limelight, the limelight, the limelight

[Verse 1]
Excuse me niki would you please minaj me
And quickly I promise not to bring eric with me
Eric is respected I am surprised evidently
You've ain't heard of rakim
Please tell me how come
I love it when you’re rocking but my niggers say it’s doo-doo
Young money, old money, I get, it true true
The money then power respect thanks Kimberley
Gotta make the money so somebody remembers me
Lyrics ain’t gonna cut it fuck it I can just simply
Sell out to sell out crowds with a recipe
I see my destiny, star on a boardwalk
Grammy night, walkin my family down the red carp
Simon cowell, next american idol is Reks, dog
I know you must think its utterly unjust, bla bla
Yada yada yada i'm a rhymer's rhymer
And I find the need to keep it designer While i ponder on

[Verse 2]
Pardon me taylor but its fairer for us to share the stage for a spell
So I can tell all the other beautiful people they are looking swell
New fashion fly as hell, the paparazzi get shots of my app-a-rel
Thats apparel for losers, apparently
You's just ain’t hip to the newest influences
Twitter Twitter how I love my tweets
I spit a little better to N-o-t-t-z beats
I go to TMZ, Vlad TV gotta get the latest in beef
And fabulous gossip just to talk shit
When I text, watch as the LOL's add up
A nigga feel glad cause technology is sweet
Come follow me on facebook even if we never speak
Career, Success, they meet, we popping
Show off barbecue and my aid to Boston
Awesome glamour and glitz i'm handling my shit so

[Verse 3]
Ipod check, iphone check
Ipad yes, I wrecks next
Looking at the XXL freshmen ten, oh well
Maybe next year when the Showoff sell
A bunch of records off the shelf
I be on the cover with em
Cause I give em something totally different
You know that feel good rhythm
Used to hit em well, now they got the digital
Fuck a major, put it online it still sell
Homie on the twitter get the link
Cop a nigga tape on the itunes, you tuned to youtube
Improve my views, great
The hate even a blessing cause it give me a discussion
Will he make it is the question
They say Reks cool, but J Cole best reppin
I like Cole, he cold fa show check out the weapon
Tell Nas, Diddy, tell Dre, Reks he a weapon
And i'm stepping in the limelight, sign the unsigned like
