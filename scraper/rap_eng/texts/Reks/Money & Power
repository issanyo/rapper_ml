[Verse 1: Termanology]
It gets dangerous, money and power is changing us
It fuck you up, have you bugging like angel dust
Remember homie from the third grade, niggas played
Took his change but now he paid and cook the caine
And now he got them thangs burners with bullets that bang
You gotta show him respect or he'll blow out your brain
You see how shit change living in the hustle game
When you came from nothing you love everything
You work for, material shit worth more
Cause when you was young you shopped at the worst store
Had the worst gear, cause you was dirt poor
So now you thirst for the first score that earn more
The currency could change a man's goals
Make him take the devil's role for a river of gold
But when all is done and the story is told
They know that Term, Reks and Sonic never sold they soul
And that's--

[Jeru the Damaja: Dollar bill y'all is the God we trust]
[Jay-Z: It gets dangerous, money and power is changing us]
[Jeru the Damaja: Dollar bill, yall-- drop your head, listen]
[Jay-Z: It gets dangerous, money and power is changing us]
[Jeru the Damaja: Dollar bill, yall-- drop your head, listen]

[Verse 2: Sonic]
It's funny how this money can change us
And make best friends become strangers
Your happiness brought that man anger
Now you can't leave the house without one in the chamber
These women can't stand no broke dudes
So just to make them happy look at what we go through
Keep thinking that I ain't feeding them soulful
Listen up baby girl this is how I approach you:
Money over my bitches, honey I love business
Don't be scared I love your hair, you nails and your love image
I roll with some thug niggas, hating on some niggas
With jealousy in their eyes, just wishing a slug in us
Hoping the cops cuff us, cause we some block lovers
Money under my covers, studied by undercovers; the block
For the cream, the cash, loot, the gwap
The dough, the narrow, the cheese, the evil don't stop
And it's--

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Reks]
Money power respect, funny how it connect
More dollars collect, more power you get
I flex hella respect, I'm a vet in the game, but trust
For every check it get dangerous
[? skills] for dollar bills, no way for us
Get a chill from momma's grill as she pray for us
Real is real, some Oxy pills, little angel dust
With Joell singing them mils cause the bills we lust
Dream was just dribble a rock and hip hop
Cause hip hop get you the drop top groupie love
Pop watch watch cops circle the block, they know the purple is hot
Murderous plot, soldiers rise to the top
Tying the rubber band knots around Benjamin locks
And all the grams smooth stash, too many grew too fast
For the pot of gold, end of the rainbow
Niggas with change rose praying to the almighty bankroll
