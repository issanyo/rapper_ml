[Chorus]
Powers have oppressed people
Her infinite powers have oppressed people
Her infinite powers have oppressed people
Her infinite powers have oppressed people

[Verse 1]
KRS was my daddy, poppa Kris had me
Pop locking my wrist to a hip-hop majesty
Pen pad mastery, sounds of Motown
When Apollo Brown crafting these instrumental masterpieces
Relive the golden era in my flow forever
Will I ever sell my soul? Hell no, never
I'm so better, a go-getter, I throw letters
Together for y'all pleasure, can I get a thank you record?
Outrank you, chess not checkers, [?] protect the bling bling
On your neck it's still chains, do whatever for the fame
It's a goddamn shame dodging gunshots
Tongue is like a shotgun bang
Got the props, fuck the fame, [?]
To the plane to the top of the Acropolis, how far I came
And my aim remain pure as the tropical waters
Salute to the fathers who gave me these powers

[Chorus]
Powers have oppressed people
Her infinite powers have oppressed people
Her infinite powers have oppressed people
Her infinite powers have oppressed people

[Verse 2]
Rakim was my daddy, poppa R had me
Perfecting my math in the paragraphs all day
Pissy hallway, little Corey with the 40
And the posse spitting poetry wishing somebody notice me
Take me out of hell as far as I can tell
L-Town full of hardships and letdowns
Frustrated meltdowns get to robbing banks and bodegas
Anxious for the paper, ain't shit they could tell ya
In the history class at last, get a hall pass
To scribble raps in my composition pad
Get the competition mad, listen, my position as dad
Got me thinking 'bout the legacy I'm leaving for my lads
For my young kings, [?] the game is vicious
Flame spittage, maim lyrics, hear the pain in my scriptures
Aim remain pure as the Holy Mecca sure is
Power of the fathers in the chorus

[Chorus]
Love
Love
Love
Love
