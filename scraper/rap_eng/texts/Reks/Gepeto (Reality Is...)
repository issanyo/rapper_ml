[Intro]
(women speaking) Troy Davis broke my heart. So that really lit my fire, when they executed an innocent man but let a baby killer go free. So I have a problem with things like that

[Verse 1: REKS]
Illegal to be high, but legal to die from cancer
Chance to commit suicide, why thank ya
Troy Davis dead, Casey Anthony free
She can have another baby, don't fuck with police
Scratch that last line, yeah, fuck the police
Everybody prep to plead the fifth when they stroll streets
We are all targets for dogs as precious as harshest
Reality's protection's preposterous, but God is
Separate from State, but the godless
Clearly state in who we trust, cause forefathers
Are the many saw one, not unity dumb dumb
But in the meek for weak to succumb
Too many were home, or fed syphilis
Guinea pigs thinkin' it was government benefits
The ignorance, the bliss of the double A's in the back, gotta love it

[Hook]
Reality is
Lies, deceit, pain, complicated pressure
Reality is
Envy, greed, mysterious, wants over needs
You see, life is make believe
Pinch me, I must be dreaming
Gotta find who Gepeto these strings
Pinocchio spreadin' them wings
Reality is

[Verse 2: REKS]
If showing your own body parts is optional
But that there caused body parts you must protect
Somethin' about this life here is not logical
Through the windshield, should've protect your neck
New wish it, but paralyzed can drive
Idiocy of it all, we can't disguise
Give the kids condom to practice safe sex
Priests making sure alter boys stay blessed
Say REKS is about shock value
Say whatever's on mind to find what button to push
Nothing 'bout what I say should have you
As upset as a criminal say, or George Bush
Our boat was not even bought cause it causes
Financial hardships, we are all heartless
Cause pain and pass off to other sources
Water cooler talk in office

[Hook]

[Verse 3: REKS]
Reality is, a tragedy just
Like a Shakespeare'in plot, Aleppo twist
Dark fantasy, yeah they exist
But Mrs. Teacher on a mission tongue kissin' teenagers and shit
Bring 'em home cause the husband a prick, that won't give her the dick
You work a six to nine, then nine to six
She take advantage cause the cameras don't capture after school field trips
But didn't recognize gossipy kids
Couple Twit pics later, Mrs. in a cell later
It's hell and the missions is given to all ages
All colors and creed can get swimsuit
Wake up in the fiery layers to no saviors
This is to say, we got the right to choose
Free will abuse, guilty consent end up front pages
Judged by the judge, judged by the people you love
Final day to the hells up above

[Hook]
