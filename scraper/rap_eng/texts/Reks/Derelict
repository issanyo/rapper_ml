[Verse 1: Ea$y Money]
I’m a motherfucking derelict, nigga, títere malo
He fuck with Easy, he get a hollow
Show no remorse, please tell him I don’t
Give a fuck about you, eat dick and swallow
Better put them on ST. we are
A bunch of mon-S-T-E-Rs
Run up on you all, let three squeeze off
Draw blood like a phlebotomist when I clap mine
Your life, that’s synonymous with your rap lies
You called a snitch on anonymous rat lines
Y’all know just what time it is when I rap I’m
Goin’ down as one of the best that did it
Wanna go rhyme for rhyme, I brought some rounds
This ain’t no merry-go, I don’t horse around
Easy will slaughter clowns, funny how the rap game
In a drought when it’s so watered down

[Verse 2: Termanology]
I’m a derelict peace to my cousin Derek in the bing
He go and said it heroin sellin’ adrenaline
I’m Einstein with the rhyme, Bonnie and Clyde
Me and my fine mami will ride, show me a sign
Getting money and I’m on it, distorting these rappers, flaunting this
It’s more than a vick I’m plotting I’m robbing the whole economy
I step into the booth I turn it into a sauna
I’m chilling in the Bahamas you chilling in your pajamas, b
Hickory dock hot nickels will pop
I’m on tour with [front?] doc and go on selling the rock
I’m the same old Term, [quarter water?] trying to roll up
Better hold up if you want to talk shit ‘bout we
I’m history and I get more gs than the average rapper
Will ever get or see. Unfortunately for you, I’m going to stick around
Keep my weed bright green, but I keep my liquor brown

[Verse 3: Reks]
Yo I’m a derelict, definite rhyme specialist
Rap’s still in a deficit unless you mention my syndicates
Speaking through raw epilogue Easy, Term, see to earn
Leapfrog, it’s your turn, jump on in
Buzz on them, [?] in, bust your gun
I clench my pen, kill the masses with the paragraphs
Us go in. Y’all just burst my thoughts cursed
Bar first, guzzle, bartender hustle hustle
Trying to keep it authenticious slaying the towns style
Brain in the clouds now my wildstyle
Fab Five Freddyish, ready set get your green on
Your clock HNIC, someone to lean on
Fuck the thuggery you mean mothery
See the team’s strong the Bean gone star gazing be long
On your radio slates for eons but these pawns
To the system’s hating, kill them all for violating

[Verse 4: Artisin]
I am like a derelict, they should put my squad in a group home
Get your dude low in the [?] I’m dealing out
Death for free, you can get a homicide coupon
Make your heart collapse, let me break you a few bones
Compound fracture, poke through the skin
Let my nigga poke your girl while I’m poking her friend
I’m a motherfucking sin, I ain’t sacrilegious
My life consists of rap, drug deals, and clapping biscuits
Shot down like a shorty when you ask for digits
I’ll tell you know that you’re wack, I am that realistic
So you could save the time and save the trees
Cause most of this paper is wasted on these fake MCs
They hate indeed, instead of spending every day hating me
They should go home and make a beat
Or write a hot verse, but I guess they’d rather get shot first
So maybe they just really forgot how being hot works
