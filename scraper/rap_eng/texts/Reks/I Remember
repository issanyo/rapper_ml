First time you gave me your love
First time you gave me your love
First time you gave me your love
Remember
First time you gave me your love
First time you gave me your love
First time you gave me your love
Remember
Saturday cartoons have never wrong tone
And tune out to the world
Consume bowls of Cheerios, really y’all
Yo, MTV raps and here we go
Yo, peeped the scenario with aerial view
Our avenues clicked cleansed and crews
Put up the bike kit standing crews
Grew up with animals, my little ham is used
Hand to hand combat to handle dudes
The weaker man lose, the stronger prevail
A room with a smell of booze
Admitting from my uncle Merlose, close
I rose in cold conditions
Told to listen before I get to give him my opinion
‘Cause a brother whipped my sibling
About out last key child days, we raised different
…we was poor but truly did it to you and escaped
Until mi amour moved me, the purple take
Aside the circulate urge to make my voice heard
But no nerve, so I’m away, bobbing in my b-boy state
Salivating for not having the patience at least till graduation
First time you gave me your love
First time you gave me your love
First time you gave me your love
Remember
First time you gave me your love
First time you gave me your love
First time you gave me your love
Remember
Growing up single mother in the house
Older brother, younger sister, daddy nowhere to be found
We ate good every holyday
Got a let them know you’re here, Cousin Justin say
Hope was what drive us South every summer
My neighbor mamma found all those friends
Used to wanna play football in the field till the lights came on
I caught my brother cursing, he knew his ass was gone
Take it out, blow it, then you put it back in
The ten dough double dribble I’m just tryina win
Neighborhood beef, now I’m fighting Boogie and Nim
Niggas throw you in the pool, you better learn to swim
Shot hoop through a milk crate, made plenty mistakes
Sat us on the porch and the snow got your chill straight
Never trade a memory for the world, material things are gold
But your mind is a pearl
A young shorty never minding them girls
Got a little bit … ought to find them girls
You know how I go
