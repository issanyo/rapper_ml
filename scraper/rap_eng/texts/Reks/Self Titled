[Chorus]
You need to stay a while I feel like telling some stories
Corey changed his name to R-E-K-S
What? R-E-K-S
What? R-E-K-S
You need to stay a while I feel like telling some stories
Corey changed his name to R-E-K-S
What? R-E-K-S
What? R-E-K-S

[Verse 1]
Once upon a time in the hiphop game
There was a brother named Reks and he wanted the fame
He wanted to shine, no he didn't purchase a chain
He wanted to rhyme, so he kept his mind on the pain
And being brought up on the grind where they hustlin' things
With strugglin' time and time again upon his brain
He became Rhythmatic Eternal King Supreme
With big dreams of being large in rap scene
His mama was a single provider 'cause daddy decided to [?]
Get gone, did fast way before the breakfast
Spinach he broke fast, look for sweater
Hopeless, gone, the weather
Forecast wasn't ever, ever, ever, ever in a dark cloud
If ever rugged out, then I'mma make y'all proud
I'm gonna make my non-believers believers now
From kickin' rocks to rockin' crowds
I became REKS and it was all a dream, I used to read word up magazine
Hangin' pictures on my wall, y'all yeah, and it don't stop

[Chorus]
You need to stay a while I feel like telling some stories
Corey changed his name to R-E-K-S
What? R-E-K-S
What? R-E-K-S
You need to stay a while I feel like telling some stories
Corey changed his name to R-E-K-S
What? R-E-K-S
What? R-E-K-S

[Verse 2]
Sit a little while I feel like tellin' some stories
First digits arrogant, fuck - His name's Corey
Corey changed his name to R-E-K-S
So all of the rest would applaud me
Used to play Atari like Lex, get the pellets, man
Back when Doug E. Fresh and Rick the Ruler used to pack jams
Backspins, graffiti cans, tricks with their hands
A microphone stand, damn
I fell in love with hiphop, man
A Kangol, an eye-patch, hoodies and some Timberlands
You remember way back when, when
Brothers was breakdancin'-cin'
Remember one christmas, mama bought me a boombox
Dare I say how loud that room got
I tuned in to a movement
Tuned out the rest of the world with my music
I became REKS and it was all a dream, I used to read word up magazine
Hangin' pictures on my wall, y'all yeah, and it don't stop

[Outro]
World premier shit off that album "REKS" droppin' this summer
Statik Selektah, Green Lantern

[Chorus]
You need to stay a while I feel like telling some stories
Corey changed his name to R-E-K-S
What? R-E-K-S
What? R-E-K-S
You need to stay a while I feel like telling some stories
Corey changed his name to R-E-K-S
What? R-E-K-S
What? R-E-K-S
