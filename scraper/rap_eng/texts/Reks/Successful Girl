"I hope that you listen"
"I know that you've been hurt many times before
You close the door and you won't let it go"

[Verse One] [Reks]:
I know this shawty right
She got a shorty right
She be workin' hard so she can keep her shorty right
She be on the job, 40 days and 40 nights
12 months a year, see she want a career
Her parents in her ear, they swear just to mold her right
Try to be aware of the peer pressures on your life
To be your wife
You gotta have the qualities of honesty
Dedication, insight
Preparation in tight times gotta grind
To the whistles pay no mind when they starin' from behind
Yellin', "Yo shawty, hey momma, let me holla."
Say "No po' no dollar, no way don't follow."
You a success gotta dress how you dress proper
Act proper for the possibilities and dreams
Sees how you don't cop a
Attitude but you move to the beat of your own groove

[Chorus] [Reks]:
I never knew a la-la-la love like this
Gotta be something for me to write this
Common sense I should don your wrist
But I'd rather give you props for accomplishments
You are a
Successful girl
An independent woman in a stressful world
My nights dream
Wifey
King's queen
You are
Success

[Verse Two] [BK Cyph]:
Every time I leave the house I get the side eye
But I ain't slippin', Black Ice, sky high
Everything Goodie, I'm just throwin' on the hoodie
Tryin' to get this money I ain't out chasin' pussy
Late nights
Sessions in the AM
Wifey in the crib
Wonderin', waitin'
I know it's frustratin' and you growin' impatient
I gotta feed the fam ma, we gonna make it
And when we do everything on me
Brand new crib, red bows on the V
Never have a want, get you everything you need
Gucci bags, Louie V, Louie Vuitton's for your feet
You was there, no matter what the circumstance
When I fucked shit up and I hurt your plans
But now I'm gettin' up
Thanks to certain fans
And the dreams we had
Now it's workin', damn

[Chorus] [Reks]:
La-la-la love like this
Gotta be something for me to write this
Common sense I should don your wrist
But I'd rather give you props for accomplishments
You are a
Successful girl
An independent woman in a stressful world
My nights dream
Wifey
King's queen
You are
Success

"You can put your trust in me"
