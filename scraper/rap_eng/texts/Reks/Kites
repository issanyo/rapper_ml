[Verse 1]
Dear Mumia, wish Obama woulda freed ya
Thought if anyone could see a reason to do it, he would
8 years in Oval Office, not a damn thing for us
It took all us as supporters to ensure that he could
Beat Hillary and Mitt
I admit, I was bamboozled by that hope shit
No shit, shoulda knew better
Whoever take a stance as you did gettin silenced
Met with violence, defyin' your ties to the Panthers, stood as a threat
Voice of the voiceless, let's not forget
Someone gon' pay that debt, when the cop laid to rest
Judge Sabo tried to fry a nigga, but you a fighter with the fire in ya
[?] a prophet or messiah figure
I'm just writing to ya, knowin there's still life within ya
You're off death row, still time's a killer
Out here these kids is lost and forgotten, the cost is options
But good ideas fall on deaf ears, they're playing possum
And I know they know you're innocent
But freedom was gone the minute when
They knew they had you the same way they had Chairman Fred
[?], Geronimo Pratt
Ratta-tat-tat your soul. Innocent or no
Doesn't matter though. COINTELPRO in control
You gotta go. I'm just tryna get into the know
Tryna understand
Understand:

[Chorus]
These kites I write to breathe life into those lost souls
Boxed in in the box, sitting, downtrodden, rotten, in a world so cold
These kites I write to breathe life in
These kites I write to breathe life in
These kites I write to breathe life into those lost souls

[Verse 2]
Dylan, why did you kill em?
Why did you enter building while they was praising Jesus? You turned em into victims
Somebody in there had to had them a funny feeling, still they accepted you
Knew someone neglected you. This world gave you the ammunition that you used to execute
Confederate flags, and fathers in white rags
Teach your children 'bout the great days, KKK
Burnt crosses, hung nooses, [?] taught you this
Hate within, 8'x10', boxed in, nothin' but time
Clutchin' a 9; clock grim when it tick-tick-tick
And you just wanna hear the trigger click-click-click
Don't wanna face the judge, face the jury, face the mugs
Of the families you tortured, plans you altered that day you lost it
That day you ruptured foundation, structure
The day they took ya in and you sucked the life outta them out of pure evil inside
You're evil inside, that's where the devil resides
It's where the trouble began. Took a look in your eyes
All I saw was emptiness, a whole lotta pain
So I began to scribble this kite, maybe in vain
But I need to understand
I'm just tryna understand

[Chorus]
These kites I write to breathe life into those lost souls
Boxed in in the box, sitting, downtrodden, rotten, in a world so cold
These kites I write to breathe life in
These kites I write to breathe life in
These kites I write to breathe life into those lost souls
