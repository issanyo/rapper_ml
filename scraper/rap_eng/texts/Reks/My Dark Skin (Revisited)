My dark skin been through the shackle of the chain, way before Barack got to talkin' 'bout change
School textbook only talk about King, they don't wanna bring up Ms. Davis
Swear the Uncle Tom, only Abraham saved us. 15 when I first seen police anger
Back when LA had Raiders be the king in the street. Before R.E. King Supreme on beat
Media tried to glorify rap beef between two kings from the west and the east
Malcolm X vs. Martin. Dubois vs. Booker T
Black on black wars even back then. I hope it's love when you look at me
My dark skin petrify the sights of the eyes, can't see us in the lows with they eyes closed
They see us as the pimps, they see us as the hoes
No Oscar for X, but the Training Day role
Now that's cinematic. Black skin is tragic
Benefiting from eye moving backwards
Backwoods where the noose ain't long ago. Come so far, so far to go
I love being me, want y'all to know. So much to teach Zeke and Jojo
My two princes, my two senses gonna be embedded minus the edit
So they can have a true history lesson on record. Disagree, just respect it
My dark skin, ripped by the switch and the cord
The good book talk about Jesus our lord
Portraits y'all adored. Pictures of Saint Nicholas ridiculous
We ain't go no damn chimney and no M.O.N.E
While Christmas missed us, my dark skin pinched pennies
Tryna make sense of this country's patience of giving just due to many will a few
By few I mean you, the elite who spew hatred at the sight of my hue. My dark skin
