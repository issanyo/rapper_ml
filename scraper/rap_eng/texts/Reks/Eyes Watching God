[Verse 1:]
How do I aim this side a the brain
[?] of a migraine
Disciplining, the mind trained
[?]
Sing
[?]
Intravenous in the vein
[?]
Picturesque I put the best
Literal lyrical visine
Open eyes, wide clean
Chi ching ching
Register dings, the sound rings
Bells of heaven or hell
You know what I mean
Eyes what you got
I be on binoculars, zoomin in
Ya’ll be suited out
No fits to cut, nigga shooted out
Took a ruly route [?]
Count the benjains
Cut out the middle man, no doubt
You know the boss model
Money over bitches
She benefits
Hush, when we initiate
Bravo to the
On this long road, lost souls
I got you

[Chorus:]
And we can see eye to eye
All day, all God-d-d-d-d
Don’t worry I got you
[?]
The devil’s a li-li-li-li-li-liar
Don’t worry I got you

[Verse 2:]
And we can see clean to the heavenly skies
Devil’s a liar
Better believe i’m gon ride
Can’t be denied, eyes wide
Mandatory preparation necessary, till I die
Till I die I push up, sit up this way
Own up to my own mistakes
Grown enough to work for my plate
[?]
Since a infant I been in pain
I pen that pain on paper
And poetry penetrated
Demonstrating mental ventilation
I’m pacing to the tick tock tick tock
Waitin patient for angels, halos
No hell a satan, no elevation
Congregation readin Revelations
Delegations to the pawns and beyond
To respond to estimating the end of times is in the makin
Better get that good book kiss your rosary
And pay your tithes
Cause I was readin about when the fire
We die [?]
Enter then we exit, nobody gets [?]

[Chorus]
