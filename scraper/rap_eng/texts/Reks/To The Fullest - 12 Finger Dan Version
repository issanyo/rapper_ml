[Intro: Sample cutting]
Represent to the fullest
Keep it underground harcore
Breathe and make classics, you got fans
I was born with the boom bap, respect the game
That's how it is, so that’s how we live
To the fullest
Hardcore style, how that sound
Keep makin' noise
Like this, y'all

[Verse 1: Reks]
Do it because we live it - Zurich to Munich
Movement, the truest
Long, long way from Massachusetts
Do spit ruthless
In the booth with legendary legacies
12 Finger Dan, me and the Masta of the Aces
Peoples Dilated, Rakaa
Sick with the blah blah, face it
Best by far, bar for bar on my worksheets
Hercules working these rhymes, no nursery
Speed dial the king, [...]
You is but a menace to societies thinking
Linkin’ with them, bully boys cross borders
Boss of the arctics, flyer than the saucers
Mind with the young prince [...]
Euros in the plurals
Franks in the bank ville digs deep
Gotta live it to the green - get incredible
Another can't afford a bean - it's inevitable

[Chorus: Sample cutting]
Yeah
Push your limits to the fullest
Keep it real though
Only way to live
That's the core
As long as I can rock a crowd, I will never be broke
That's just the daily routine
Be doin' my thing
Rise it up, beat down verbally
Spittin' the raw in the atmosphere

[Verse 2: Masta Ace]
Not too many can do it like yours truly
That's ’cause when I do it, I gotta do it fully
I mean goin’ all out, no frontin', no slackin’
Nigga, feel movin' the crowd from the front to the back
You have never seen a greater man
Like a instrument my voice gets into it and I play the band
I'm like a porn section, you want protection
Cause I hit you with the rhyme, no one's an exception
I gotta get my all like the engine that could
Yeah, I’m goin' all out for my friends in the hood
With no off days, that's a very good model
Like pourin' a tall glass from a very good bottle
You gotta sip it slow, man, savor the moment
You don't wanna start a war with your favorite opponent
That's the man in the mirror, that greyish reflection
I'm here to let the love spread like a crazy infection

[Chorus: Sample cutting]
To the fullest
Hardcore style, how dat sound
Keep makin' noise
Like this, y'all
Doin' it like this
To the fullest
Yo, we realer than the illest on wax
That's real, that's ill, that's me
DJ, Producer

[Verse 3: Rakaa Iriscience]
To be the artist, pitch and paint the corner like Rembrandt
I rep rocksteady MC on my friends there
Manifestin' mind, soul and body
One ring, we hit 'em with the juice, so godly
Frontin' like they did something just for showin' up
Mad at weed, cause we wouldn't think slow enough
Birds afraid of heights, warriors afraid to fight
Torchbearers cower in the darkness, afraid of light
I'm blessin' clarity and watchin' them streets watch
We movin' quarterly and listen when the streets talk
Cali, Munich, Mas, Brooklyn, streets that we walk
When it's a complete thought, any planet we rock
The team expand, evidence of bad moves
Pushin' limits to the fullest, execute the plan
Then tilt the thornes to my hardrock crown
But town clash rock real, lay the whole block down

[Outro: Sample cutting]
Keepin' shit alive just because we live it
Another classic - keep makin' noise
You amateur MCs, so what you wanna do?
We will never stop spittin the facts
With the craziest beef, I'm as great as it gets
Put your hands to the sky
Push your limits to the fullest
Hardcore style, like this, y'all
I don't give a fuck I'll stay I while if you want it
Gotta represent my fans
We doin' it like this, to the fullest
No BS, no time for stress
We do it because we live it
R to the E, K to the N, Masta Ace
To all my people feelin' this
Killin' the track, killin' the track
That's just the daily routine, doin' my thing
Let's take it back to the beat
With the mixer and the turntables
Whack MCs can't exist no way up in the broke game
We doin' it like this
To the fullest
That's the way it is, the way it's gonna be
Boom bap, boom bap
With the craziest beef, I'm as great as it gets
