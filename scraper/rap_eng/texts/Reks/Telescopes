Why you wanna roll them Dice?
Don't you wanna see what Hope brings?
Careful before you wReck your life
See through my, telescope eyes
I can see the future, I
I can see the future
When a change gon' come?
When a change gon' come?
I'd like to share with your telescopes

[Verse One] [Reks]
Peace to my niggas livin' oh so hood
Rest in peace too early cause they know no good
I know shit ain't democratic in our demographic
The wars on outside, the streets tragic
Street's average, about a, kill in a minute
Don't need to see overseas death, we livin' in it
In tenement climates, violence or business
Jails higher the death tolls, cops hire to witness
Reason why so many kids is gettin' buried
They all carry same heat cops on beats carry
We don't need momma worried
Shit ain't necessary
We need new leaders, modern revolutionary
The revolution televised, should we be surprised?
Rather watch Flavor Of Love than realize
Pre-Armageddon happenin' right before our eyes
Technology disconnect me from outside

[Verse Two] [John Hope]
I wipe the sweat off my dome, spit my phlegm on the beat
In the street
They fight cold wars with heat
Believe, the more drama, the more karma
It's not a myth, I was Hope before Obama
With the visions of a world where we educate the careless
I never lift weights but I raise awareness
I'm strong
My third eye see my first born quiver
Math class, harass when he first heard 'nigga'
I said, "It's not the first nor the last."
But bored in class, use your brain like a shotgun blast
And the impact will keep 'em intact when they provokin' 'em
I know it's in arms reach, society Utopian
Now how you like them apples, pears and oranges?
You didn't think that this nigga here from Providence could change the world
As I stand in the session
I'm not poor but I beg the questions
So answer

When a change gon' come?
When a change gon' come?

[Verse Three] [Lucky Dice]
I can see through my telescope to right where you are
Hey, hey, hey you're a super superstar
Maybe if you believe that you are
Then you'll find that you'll go far
But you're young and you still wanna bug out
20 years later you'll find yourself strung out
Cause you made them bad choices
Them bad choices
They was just bad habits
Truthfully you could be the illest if you wanted to, that's my witness
But it's a future where nobody listens and so it stays distant
Gone and forgotten, but it could be different
To find a way to them brighter days
Use your mind it'll light the way
That's what I like to say
Too many youngins out there dyin' on a righteous day
Just tryin' to get they money right
