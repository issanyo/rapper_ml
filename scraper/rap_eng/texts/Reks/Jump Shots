[Verse 1: Reks]
Bad boy Piston 89'
I was trying to be like number 11, shorty with the dimes
I ain't talking block >??< 'til the block passin' time
Zeke Thomas, we had similar dramas, similar mamas
Related to >??< future promise
He from Chicago, Lawrence's all that I know
But I saw the similar dilemma
The harsh hold on lost souls, pops gone, eyes closed, christmas morn'
Wishing for a new Spalding
Needed to change their logo from Jerry West to Jordan
Saw them hoop dreams turn pipe dreams, when in the night fiends, lean
Drug dealers whip is so clean
MCs jewels is so flashy and Pippen posterize Patrick Ewing, so nasty
Class be boring as hell, trying to pay attention
Then jigga dropped that "Hard Knocked Life" teaching lessons about...

[Hook]

Hood dreams
Hoop it up in Hip Hop
Settled on the mic, cause I ain't had a wicked jump shot (a wicked jump shot)
I ain't had a wicked jump shot
Settled on the mic, cause I ain't had a wicked jump shot  (wicked jump shot)

Hood dreams
Hoop it up in Hip Hop
Settled on the mic, cause I ain't had a wicked jump shot (wicked jump shot)
I ain't had a wicked jump shot
Settled on the mic (on the mic, on the mic)

[Verse 2: Reks]

Leaders of the new came to my school watching
The young Busta bust, fuck shit up, that >??< energy
The pinpoint, the precise point in life and enemy
To gather thoughts mentally, jot them down rhythmically
Walk through town processing sounds of the city
Millcity ain't seeing mills low to them Hava Hills
Really damn right 'em
Rich history forgotten
Got to talkin' with ma momma but the longer she discover
When she first came to Mass from South Carolina
>??< before ho wanna follow behind her
