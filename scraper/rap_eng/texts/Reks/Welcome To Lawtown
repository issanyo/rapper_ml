[Chorus:]
Lawtown, Fuck fuck fuck ya niggas
Rap hard but keep a low profile
Ya heard the boss
Fast and safe to say you heard of the law
Represent Lawtown, Where they made me at
Lawtown, Fuck fuck fuck ya niggas
Rap hard but keep a low profile
Ya heard the boss
Fast and safe to say you heard of the law
Represent Lawtown, Where they made me at

[Verse 1: Clip]
I'm from a city that's divided in half
North side South side each side you get clacked
You got thugs on these streets with them burners to blast
Hustlers on every street every corner is crack
Where I'm from, nobody giving a fuck
You got girls ten years old already giving it up
And the older they grow man the harder it gets
Fourteen walking around and follow these kids and that's nothing
Its just a taste where i'm from
Where niggas look you in the eye and [?]
Its the 978 man my cities a slum
Where they lay off cops cause we low on funds
Can't you get you an education but can get you a gun
Where if you ain't got one then i bet you gon' run
Its the LAW city of Feds
Where niggas don't beef they murder you fair. Haha, Yea

[Chorus]

[Verse 2: Reks]
Born and raised in the bottoms where it get darker than gothru
Two bedroom Apartments
Same similar problems
Cockroaches and rodents
Pops went from the loving
Uncle dope and Billy thuggin
Cousin T a'pluggin
A nigga come from hell
Right around the corner from the uppity streets of Andover where they living well
Where they was playing poker
Corey used to poke'em
Not to kiss and tell but to paint a visual
We are the have nots we have not materials
No name brand cereals Corey ate the magic stars
We used to imagine gods only for the white folk
Seeing all the white folk was living so swell
I used to walk to thorndike for a bag of goodies
Carried the hefty bag of Zay Zays on hoodies
Whole hood be full of hood hooded town
Middle East America war zone what we like to call Lawtown

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Clip]
It ain't over man shit get deep
Behind every project wall there is a kid with a dream
But instead of running [?] man he is running with teams
Instead of not thugging at all he thugging for cream
You know, Living it up the code of the street
Stay loyal do not snitch [?]
And if a cat get cocked than he doing his time
Lawtown, my city make you lose your mind
Scientifik put us on [?] other down
Reks gave us real ask T what is now
Look around we a movement we can't be stopped
Home of the haze and we all we got
Hustlers on every street because we love that guap
And ain't nothing gonna change until Lawtown pop
We 978 [9]
Lawtown, home of American gangsters

[Outro: Clip]
Yea Yea welcome to Lawtown city
Home of the gritty and grimy my city is tiny
Hustlers on every block with they Phillies and Heinies
Popping weed, popping yay, pop that milly for money
Yea Yea welcome to Lawtown city
Home of the gritty and grimy my city is tiny
Hustlers on every block with they Phillies and Heinies
Popping weed, popping yay, pop that milly for money

[Chorus]
