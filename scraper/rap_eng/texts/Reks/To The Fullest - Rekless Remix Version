[Verse 1: Reks]
Do it because we live it - Zurich to Munich
Movement, the truest
Long, long way from Massachusetts
Do spit ruthless
In the booth with legendary legacies
12 Finger Dan, me and the Masta of the Aces
Peoples Dilated, Rakaa
Sick with the blah blah, face it
Best by far, bar for bar on my worksheets
Hercules working these rhymes, no nursery
Speed dial the king, [...]
You is but a menace to societies thinking
Linkin' with them, bully boys cross borders
Boss of the arctics, flyer than the saucers
Mind with the young prince [...]
Euros in the plurals
Franks in the bank ville digs deep
Gotta live it to the green - get incredible
Another can't afford a bean - it's inevitable

[Verse 2: Rakaa Iriscience]
To be the artist, pitch and paint the corner like Rembrandt
I rep rocksteady MC on my friends there
Manifestin' mind, soul and body
One ring, we hit 'em with the juice, so godly
Frontin' like they did something just for showin' up
Mad at weed, cause we wouldn't think slow enough
Birds afraid of heights, warriors afraid to fight
Torchbearers cower in the darkness, afraid of light
I'm blessin' clarity and watchin' them streets watch
We movin' quarterly and listen when the streets talk
Cali, Munich, Mas, Brooklyn, streets that we walk
When it's a complete thought, any planet we rock
The team expand, evidence of bad moves
Pushin' limits to the fullest, execute the plan
Then tilt the thornes to my hardrock crown
But town clash rock real, lay the whole block down

[Chorus]
We are
To the fullest in this bitch
We are
To the fullest in this bitch
We are
To the fullest in this bitch
We are, we are
To the fullest in this bitch

[Verse 3: Masta Ace]
Not too many can do it like yours truly
That's 'cause when I do it, I gotta do it fully
I mean goin' all out, no frontin', no slackin'
Nigga, feel movin' the crowd from the front to the back
You have never seen a greater man
Like a instrument my voice gets into it and I play the band
I'm like a porn section, you want protection
Cause I hit you with the rhyme, no one's an exception
I gotta get my all like the engine that could
Yeah, I'm goin' all out for my friends in the hood
With no off days, that's a very good model
Like pourin' a tall glass from a very good bottle
You gotta sip it slow, man, savor the moment
You don't wanna start a war with your favorite opponent
That's the man in the mirror, that greyish reflection
I'm here to let the love spread like a crazy infection

[Verse 4: Roger Rekless]
Ein Mic, ein Mensch und ein Schritt
Geh da mitten in das Licht und dann spitte deinen Shit
Ich erzitter wenn ichs mitkrieg, dass in der ersten Reihe jemand Zeilen aus mei'm Leben mitsingt
Was das Leben mitbringt pack ich auf Beats
Gewinnen, verlieren, Fifty-Fifty, Tauziehen
Und ich lieb diesen Rapschei√ü, weil ich Leiden immer wieder nieder in nen Text schreib
Ich leide nicht, ich liebe wenn die Textzeil'n wiederspiegeln, Dinge von mir nehmen, ich bin echt frei
Mama guck, Masta Ace auf meinem Beat drauf
Rakaa Iriscience, Dialated, ja so siehts aus
Reks und Rek go together in this rappin' shit
Because we live it, the description, it is accurate
To the fullest oder zu jeder Uhrzeit
Moderne Philosophen, Epikurstyle

[Chorus]
We are
To the fullest in this bitch
We are
To the fullest in this bitch
We are
To the fullest in this bitch
We are, we are
To the fullest in this bitch
