[Intro]
Cry baby. Cry. You ain't gotta wipe your eyes. ohh
Music heals the soul. Momma I love you. I know I ain't been the best son

[Verse One]
1977
Out of the heavens it did rain
Pamala Christine will endure, through the pain
Barely 17, no big plans or wedding rings
She was still in high school, ditchin' class, nahmean?
She was not a fiend but she smoke
Not a dream or a hope
Alex would have stayed but Alex ass strayed
Still she was knocked up, Alex got locked up
Would have took binoculars to find where baby papa was
Still the object of the story is the shorty with a shortie in her stomach
Pamela was confronted, will you keep this here a secret?
Could you raise it? Could you keep it?
Saddest part, this is deja vu got her thinkin'
1976
If the baby wasn't aborted
It's be the second little Corey
And I know she can't afford it, she a youngin' in the mix
Barely fill her own tummy, tell me how it come to this?

[Hook]
I heard Pamela got a baby
The woman got to feel the pain
A damn shame, the child barely 17
No more goals, no more dreams for her foolery
It left dear momma weak
What will it do to me?
Pam's got a baby
Someone's got to feel the pain
A damn shame, the child barely 17
No more goals, no more dreams for her foolery
It left dear momma weak
What will it do to me?

[Verse Two]
Who know 'bout hunger pains?
Suffer with baby sisters
How many have you lost?
Audrey and B. I miss ya
Corey can never floss
Hand-me-down torn skimpies
Livin' with auntie, "Is momma comin'?" it's sorta iffy
Daddy was never there
I used to box with Billy
Streets of Newbury raised me and I love my city
Came from a broken home
Folks smokin' marijuana
Sniffin' them lines, I wrote rhymes on Park & Howard corner
Felt like parent's disowned us
Spock and me used to roam
Across the city, low pockets, lookin' for room and home
You niggas deep into dinners, I said to each his own
I got a head on my shoulders and plus this microphone
Grew up with nothin', we made somethin' on them holidays
For kicked out of school made momma a lot less proud of A's
Nicky, baby bro, look I apologize
Just thought you could see daddy within your brother's eyes
Little knucklehead, wet the bed, many fears
Got to 18 alive on my momma sweatin' tears
And I'm here
Still crazy
Secrets revealed, wish I kept it concealed
Cry baby

[Verse Three]
Young teen
If daddy dies of A.I.D.S. don't you cry baby
Rat and roaches infested but we'll get by baby
Slept on that pull out so many nights had my eyes lazy
Little brats on the streets, fixin' to die maybe
Don't want my boys comin' over, she gettin' high daily
I coulda tried harder, to help you get by momma
I now see how you lost your life due to my father
Accept my deepest regrets, I showed you disrespect
Couldn't take all that yellin', I had pride to protect
I love you Pamela
I love you Trevor too
Scars and scrapes, ups and downs understandable
If you was me as a child I couldn't handle you
But you was givin' at gifts, see struggle and persist
See trouble, can't resist
I'm changin' my ways, new books is in this music
But I'm aimin' for A's
Nowadays even cowards spray, all I do is pray
I'm cool to walk in your light
Just help me find my way
And I'm here, still crazy
Secrets revealed
Wish I kept 'em concealed
Cry baby
Cry baby
Cry
