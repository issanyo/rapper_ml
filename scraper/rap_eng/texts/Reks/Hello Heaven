[Verse 1]
Hello heaven, welcome heaven, this is my life
Bye-bye to bad times, zoom in with the bright lights
Momma in the hospital bed, I see you being fed
Tube in your mouth, they claiming you dead
But instead, hello heaven, hello heaven love
Open your eyes, whispered a word
Here's what you said
You said "I'm gonna walk through the doors, get strong"
So much to fulfill in life for real
Illness making your bones succumb
But you a soldier
Soaked up power to lift and move boulders
Third rock weight on your shoulders
Feeling cold as Kris Kingle's toes is
Medication got you out of focus
So they called you hopeless
Told her she was near comatosis
Tears on your cheeks when I wrote this
Hello heaven love
Note this, momma woke with tears on her whole face
And yeah I downed a whole case
Chose to celebrate heavens gates gonna wait for her old age
So we take time to thank above
Hello heaven love

[Hook x2]
Love, love, love, love
Hello my love
Love, love, love, love
Hello heaven love

[Verse 2]
Hello heaven, welcome heaven to my world
What will convince me to leave my girl?
Baby in the belly, we arguing steady
Son here already, for another, are we ready?
My heavy thinking of the choice we made
We ain't God, judge or jury, how a life we take?
Hello my love
I'm sorry for the choice we made
The voice we played is in my brain
I can't be getting rid of my fam
If I'm to be damned and damn
So be it
Like Soviet Union, (?) music
Alleviate pain, still I'm Judas
Evil maneuvers, my baby's youth gets removed with
A decision I now consider stupid
I took your innocence
Trip to clinic with a plan to end it quick
Hello my love
Where's the benefit?
Zeeky going years not knowing what a sibling is
Venomous conscience feeling guilty all just
Trying to reminisce and get the stress off us
It's why I take time to look above
Heaven hello
Hello heaven love
