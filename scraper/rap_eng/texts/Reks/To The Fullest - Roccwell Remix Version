[Verse 1: Reks]
Do it because we live it - Zurich to Munich
Movement, the truest
Long, long way from Massachusetts
Do spit ruthless
In the booth with legendary legacies
12 Finger Dan, me and the Masta of the Aces
Peoples Dilated, Rakaa
Sick with the blah blah, face it
Best by far, bar for bar on my worksheets
Hercules working these rhymes, no nursery
Speed dial the king, [...]
You is but a menace to societies thinking
Linkin' with them, bully boys cross borders
Boss of the arctics, flyer than the saucers
Mind with the young prince [...]
Euros in the plurals
Franks in the bank ville digs deep
Gotta live it to the green - get incredible
Another can’t afford a bean - it's inevitable

[Chorus]
Masta Ace, Reks, Mykill Miers, all with Rakaa Iriscience
Know you want another CD of that
Hardcore rap shit, we got a degree in that
Masta Ace, Reks, Mykill Miers, all with Rakaa Iriscience
Hardcore rap shit, we got a degree in that
Represent to the fullest

[Verse 2: Masta Ace]
Not too many can do it like yours truly
That's ’cause when I do it, I gotta do it fully
I mean goin' all out, no frontin', no slackin'
Nigga, feel movin' the crowd from the front to the back
You have never seen a greater man
Like a instrument my voice gets into it and I play the band
I'm like a porn section, you want protection
Cause I hit you with the rhyme, no one's an exception
I gotta get my all like the engine that could
Yeah, I'm goin’ all out for my friends in the hood
With no off days, that’s a very good model
Like pourin' a tall glass from a very good bottle
You gotta sip it slow, man, savor the moment
You don’t wanna start a war with your favorite opponent
That's the man in the mirror, that greyish reflection
I'm here to let the love spread like a crazy infection

[Chorus]
Masta Ace, Reks, Mykill Miers, all with Rakaa Iriscience
Know you want another CD of that
Hardcore rap shit, we got a degree in that
Masta Ace, Reks, Mykill Miers, all with Rakaa Iriscience
Hardcore rap shit, we got a degree in that
Represent to the fullest

[Verse 3: Mykill Miers]
Mykill Miers of the legend like a Sasquatch
And I know what time it is like a stopwatch
They playerhated on me and cockblocked
They didn't stop me, man, I still made the top spot
’Cause I'm a walking affirmation, homie
If I don't have it, you know I have to take it, homie
That's how it is, words to my kids
Words to my wiz, I'm out here yellin "Biz"
You better get in my proper respect
If you owe me you know that I gotta collect
I been around the globe and I got me a cheque
And it ain't none of y'all that stoppin' me yet
I don't talk about it, just do it
On the way to Munich, man, they feel the music
Reks, Rakaa, Ace up in the place
This shit is great, we bring it straight up to your face

[Chorus]
Masta Ace, Reks, Mykill Miers, all with Rakaa Iriscience
Know you want another CD of that
Hardcore rap shit, we got a degree in that
Masta Ace, Reks, Mykill Miers, all with Rakaa Iriscience
Hardcore rap shit, we got a degree in that
Represent to the fullest

[Verse 4: Rakaa Iriscience]
To be the artist, pitch and paint the corner like Rembrandt
I rep rocksteady MC on my friends there
Manifestin' mind, soul and body
One ring, we hit 'em with the juice, so godly
Frontin' like they did something just for showin' up
Mad at weed, cause we wouldn't think slow enough
Birds afraid of heights, warriors afraid to fight
Torchbearers cower in the darkness, afraid of light
I'm blessin' clarity and watchin' them streets watch
We movin' quarterly and listen when the streets talk
Cali, Munich, Mas, Brooklyn, streets that we walk
When it's a complete thought, any planet we rock
The team expand, evidence of bad moves
Pushin' limits to the fullest, execute the plan
Then tilt the thornes to my hardrock crown
But town clash rock real, lay the whole block down
