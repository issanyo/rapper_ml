This is pages….from the pavement
Come out to play with America’s most dangerous
This is pages….from the pavement
Come out to play with America’s most dangerous

[V1: Termanology]
When I see that light/then I got that piff
When I got that piff/then I need that light
And I need that white witta bigger bag/get it back
Wit my goons and they off on Trinidad/finna spaz
Wit a mini mac in the mini van
Chillin wit my killas that would need guns in they hand
Tryina get a milly and
Tied up in the can for the shit he had….to the back
Tell em don’t move when he got that tool
Bet her eyes move when he got that groove
Send the animals thru when he got them jewels
Better watch yo shoes/watch yo crew
Spit yo game/talk yo shit/grab yo gat/call yo click
Gotta walk into that pit of flames….tryina get that change
Better tell em I came wit a venomous thang in a fucked up game
Woulda stuffed yo chain/gotta puff my brains out/Tryina stay sane
Look up in the mirror, only one I can blame/can’t complain
Could be worse/coulda been rolled out in that hearse
Wit a hole in my head on the way to that dirt/
Just let me spit my pages first

[V2: Ea$y Money]
Yeah this another page from the pavement
My Peoples at the bottom tryina raise from the basement
Anxious and patient to blazes thru ya station
Cuz every single bar/every phrase is amazing
I give a fuck about a lame nigga hatin
Inf beam on it/when I aim/I ain’t grazin
Gauges are blazin/straight thru his face and
Mommy couldn’t identify his face when they traced em
Deuce deuce/three 80/Fo-5 and a K
Shouldn’t even be a question if we let the hammers spray
Do it for the fami-lay/the M and the A
Haver-hill on my shoulders/I hold the weight like a Manta ray
Homey/the street: we represent
Made niggas hit the club and sneak Berettas in
You loud mouth cowards should at least be reticent
Before this: BUH BUH BUH like it got a speech impediment

I came up from the basement/Ramen noodle days
In a daze/scribbling pain….pages from pavement
Pacing patient/momma dealt with drama
Daddy was a dead beat/HIV was Karma
Still I beat out all the….hardships
I raw flip/Gods gift/no more see-saw shit
Aw shit…..manure and that raw ish
Not talking fish scale, pardon…my thoughts can get
A bit scatter brained/beneath concrete came
R-e KING supreme/just a dollar and a dream/
Ya’knaw mean? Boy ya……. came a long
Way from the bodegas that’s fulla GOYA/guns n yay
My funds would say…a bit mediocre
Till I elevated vocal focus like I was supposed ta
Ills for the bills be Slaine La Coka Nostra
My boys boiling water/I was tryina
Be the illest author….shout out the best to do it
Apocalyptic/Brando-Godfather
