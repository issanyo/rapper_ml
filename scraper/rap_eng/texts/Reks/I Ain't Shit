[Chorus]
If you wanna tell me, nigga then tell me
Nigga then tell me, I ain’t shit
If you wanna judge me, nigga then judge me
Nigga then judge me, I ain’t shit
If you never loved me, why don’t you leave me?
Why don’t you leave me? I ain’t shit
If you wanna hurt me, nigga then hurt me
You’re part of my family, I ain’t shit

[Verse 1]
Lowest position to be is in the dirt man
I’m in that position like underneath the earth fam
See Jesse birthed Pam and Pam met David
And David just couldn’t stay, Pam couldn’t take it
Had to face it in them dirty dark slums
Where we barely saw crumbs, wishing thanksgiving come
But a lonely son stolen from God’s hands
Only homie get my plans with this dark skin, accepted outcast
Got pressured by ass before the adolescence
Malnourished, I guess it’s a blessing to understand hunger
Do other younger kids wonder where their school clothes
Handed them Skippies with holes and so my shoes froze
I was a bully, a punk, got A’s and I flunked
He got AIDS, I was shocked but didn’t comprehend
When momma said we was not infected by his sins
Yeah we was on the block but that was innocence

[Chorus]
If you wanna tell me, nigga then tell me
Nigga then tell me, I ain’t shit
If you wanna judge me, nigga then judge me
Nigga then judge me, I ain’t shit
If you never loved me, why don’t you leave me?
Why don’t you leave me? I ain’t shit
If you wanna hurt me, nigga then hurt me
You’re part of my family, I ain’t shit

[Verse 2]
I used to beg for a place to stay, no bed
Nigga lay down on the floor and just close the eyes
No disguise, many knew I was in a bind
Sure they tried but this was my mountain to climb
Counting time thinking I’m destined to be great
See the great comes from nothing, what an obvious fate
A day late, one hundred pennies short
Smoking Newports on my way to court
Like Big he caught for an assault, I never did real time or a real crime
That’s a reason to be proud yet and still I’m feeling like
Iron Mike must have felt when he got that facial tattoo
Things I say so taboo mad at you? Nah displaced anger
Smoking, sipping Tanqueray, never met a stranger
Me and depression we are close like the star and manger
Jesus and the angels, I’m a picture painter
I ain’t shit but an egotistical bastard
See a pistol I’ll blast it, weak with peer pressure
Speak with fear bet ya, thought I had a heart of stone
Many years later rectangle box all alone

[Chorus]
If you wanna tell me, nigga then tell me
Nigga then tell me, I ain’t shit
If you wanna judge me, nigga then judge me
Nigga then judge me, I ain’t shit
If you never loved me, why don’t you leave me?
Why don’t you leave me? I ain’t shit
If you wanna hurt me, nigga then hurt me
You’re part of my family, I ain’t shit

[Verse 3: Reks]
Late calls, I ain’t coming home, studio time, crashing at spots
I can see you there just watching the clock (I ain’t shit)
If I could think about myself less
And focus on the pain I’m causing at home (yes)
But I’m too selfish
Worthless and helpless, chosen to be reckless
Poisoning myself with nicotine and Hennessy
To the flesh and memory, ask a simple question
I’m raising my voice instantly, the Devil is an enemy
A liar and a friend to me, keeping em close
Is to to Hell that you’re sending me? One last toast
To the born beggar who cried himself to sleep
When Billy said men don’t weep but I wept and I slept
And I woke then I smoked then I drink but I quit
And I quote, I’m a hypocrite
Pause that shit for a sec, I need a cigarette

[Outro]
I ain’t shit
