[Verse 1 Curt@!ns:]
My phone went off
Somebody said, "It's been a little minute since Dope went off."
So I had to throw one off
Set fire in the booth then the smoke went off
You don't really wanna talk when the toast involved
Double R killin' niggas like them Oakland boys
Suicide doors feelin' like a coastin' car
Yeah he too gone
Got two Golden Arms, I see U-God
I'm heavy on the freaks better watch them broads
I'm heavy in the streets, new watch new car
Oh no he didn't
Look at his Benz
Wait what's that?
Dope's shittin' again
You little motherfuckers all gitty about rims
While I'm out lookin' for boats just like the Children Of Men
Huh?
Don't come through my city again
You think you're fly, I'm Flier
How Philly of him
Huh, I spark niggas like a philly with mids
Huh, two guns I've extended the Clipse
Push!
I cause Malice
I call Statik
Tell these little rats niggas, get in the gym
Huh
Get they wait up
Or get ate up
I got my plate up
Where's my fuckin' waiter!
I need breakfast, hahaha
Nice necklace
I wreck shit, so I jumped on Reks shit
If you think this shit crazy wait till you hear my next shit

[Verse 2 Reks:]
This for my doggies on the east east
Homie gon' eat eat
All the Wheat-ies ies
Stormy lines, Corey lines, borderline, P.E
Revolution, evolution, E.T
Bartender pourin' my rum and lime
Come a time I ain't got a dollar sign
I'mma be just fine
2010 Columbine
Bomber when I find a rhymer with my kind of grammar
And I promise I'mma sign up to his Twitter page
It's the age of the technological craze
L.O.L. 'em to death
R.E.K.S., ahead of my days
Hours, minutes, seconds pen pressed to the page
Bench pressin' this western beat
Sleep, you cray
Z, baby
The beat he's slayin'
Cause I do wreck shit and he close curtains
This for certain
Nice cause I say so
LMFAO
Don't quit your J.O
Ayo, T.K.O
Pen play fortified, leave my foes mortified
Sure to die, surely I
All the time slay those
Flow since a day old
Patata/potato, you get baked, hey ho
I make doe, over your head joint
Connected like the halo
For real
Comparisons pale
Embarrassin' to me though
Think about ceiling heights
Sick with it y'all niggas feel alright
