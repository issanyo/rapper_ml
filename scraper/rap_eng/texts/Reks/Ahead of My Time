Okay, so this joint right here
I guess is to prove the point
Not to be acknoited
One day should have..
See I'm ahead on my time
And then rhyme
Now many compare, all we care yeah
Vocally, fought could be so..on a beat not me
Chose to be not to bose, but grandios
Granny spoke, I listen while the rhythm I broke
Gray 8 stood in then and had hopes
I hope I didn't disappoint, but your dreams is your dreams
And you can only try to sway in the copes
But in the end I got a solo the slopes
By that I mean the crime it is mine and I'm just trying to cope
Tight rope down his hat a long drop bout you
Got props 'cause he dope, but he optical pope
And..part in, and I'm trying to provoque
Moment of clarity tackles me I'm wanting to go
And I quote let's be clear here
Destiny talks for every Michael Jordan born is a .. man to go
I took the fall for the.. biggy smalls the ones
Conceited me for the matrix and y'all
Playball, balling king share a visit is round
At least the fact as being captured on film
I had on my tongue
Hiding on this road so long
Alone and Lord knows how I gave my all
And not too early, am I worthy
'cause I've been my soul
Woking in the shadow of gozy
Put me in the back of the line, I'm, I'm
Ahead, ahead, ahead of my time
Rest in peace to that earls of the world
Who drove of that rap agaist the clap
Tryin to earn the pearls consumers
Real, homie said I had the skill
Lack the floss of a rick ross time's changed dog
Gotta have swag, I cannot help that
I'm more concerned when I can see as a good dad
Good bad, right wrong, nigga face fat
Take advise any means to get dough that
Don't wanna know that
My little boys have respect for me, till I lost respect homie
Let them see owes mob me
Chains get to be more like my pears
That's more less my fears, while ya'll say I last swag
You will follow any trend in them Gucci bag it's truly sad
Influential with the pencil as Albert Einstein with the mental
It's simple, I had em a tongue
Hiding on this road so long
Alone and Lord knows how I gave my all
And not too early, am I worthy
'cause I've been my soul
Woking in the shadow of gozy
Put me in the back of the line, I'm, I'm
Ahead, ahead, ahead of my time
