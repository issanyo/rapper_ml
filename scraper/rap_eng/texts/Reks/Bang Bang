Bang bang
To know the truth and tell it and I been called heretic
The poor population permanently in epidemic
Living condition ain't hereditary, REKS is skeptic(?)
Pressure to leave a mirror image on structures all for a necklace
Skin color definite(?), My brother's wealth is expendable to me long as I'm leaving with this money
Funny, they sit back and laugh at it when brothers blast at us, we.. God fear us
Please, police gang bang until we bleed
Crip, Bloody-blood fluid, bust Rugers to maneuver the hellish slums in the cells they hum, pictures of.. live and die by the gun
Villified since he was young, decide to be so villainous
It's all a system amplifying the ignorance
Glorify differences, Even if we one and the same...
What's that you claim ?

Chorus:
Bang bang bang bang
Murder, more murder, more homicide in the ghettos
Bang bang bang bang
Murder, more murder, more homicide in the ghettos
Homicide of the lazy, how the world made em
We're all fucking crazy, nigga pick another color then they pushin daisies
Living in the moment, looking at your brother like opponents
Kill another man for clothing, block rolling
Shotty totin', taste blood, mouth opened
Leave another nigga dead on your couch, cousin
Fuck your house, if you rep a nigga point em out
Turn your stomach to a spouse (?) so we pour em out
Here come the snouts watch your mouth when they come around
They got a unit for your ass so they're coming down
Another young black male found under jail
Liquor pourin, let us mourn, won't ya? Teddy bears on the trees from cees(?) killed on the corner
Kids hit by strays cause crime pays, niggers pay just to do their thing and let it rain
Bang, bang!

Chorus:
Bang bang bang bang
Murder, more murder, more homicide in the ghettos
Bang bang bang bang
Murder, more murder, more homicide in the ghettos
Police patrols are supposed to protect the innocent
Why you think  Bobbie Seale  militant?
How you think killing get out of control in ghettos
It just goes to show with.. citizens
My sneakers and my skin color, what's the difference?
Catch another body like syphilis
Put the flag on his head layin on his death bed
I don't give a fuck nigga, that's what his daddy said
I don't give a fuck nigga, that's what his momma said
Karma lead to a box six feet under legs
Some are fed with the misconception
Kids under protection
We're all headin' to hell, pick your direction
Huh, a demon in the flesh, let us pray again
Learn your lesson, bandannas under the church clothes when gang signs was the reverend
But he found the Lord when his homie found the morgue
Bang bang!

Chorus:
Bang bang bang bang
Murder, more murder, more homicide in the ghettos
Bang bang bang bang
Murder, more murder, more homicide in the ghettos
