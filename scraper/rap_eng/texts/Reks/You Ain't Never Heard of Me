[Hook]
You ain't never heard of me
But after this I guarantee
You gon' committed to the Reks for life
You ain't never heard of me
But after this I guarantee
You gon' committed to the Reks for life
You ain't never heard of me
But after this I guarantee
You gon' committed to the Reks for life
You ain't never heard of me
But after this I guarantee

[Verse 1]
I hear the cheap shots day in, day out, blastin' my name
As if anybody out there slightly fathom my pain
Critics reviews, spittin' the news about my single
I see the hate in most MC's eyes each time we mingle
Dappin' me and then attacking me is forbidden
If blastin' me your livin'
Don't ask me about passion when I'm spittin'
Y'all not even a smidgen of half of me ya written
In freestyle my brain's not even questioned, it's a given
Pure focus, when I scrill it like poachers when I wrote this
When I write, my mind expand like the belly of Oprah's
Hunger pains 'til the blood in my veins begin to suffer
Well like it said, what don't take your life'a make you tougher
So I write until my finger tips are cripple-shaped
Touch you like a triple eight, to ventilate your mental state
I get so all abstract [?], don't tell 'em what my pen'll spray
Don't ask me of you're wack, son that's just what I was sent to say
Whether you're with Mos Def or whether you're into Jay
Just give me a sec' to explain what I was sent to say

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
I roll with Skits dawg, guess a brotha guilty by association
I kept to your hood chief, I swear I hope your hatin'
My folks been waitin' to brawl through this paper chasin'
Y'all expectin' the Reks to fall, I stuck out my chest to all
Pressed it off, blessin' from the gods keep me focusin'
I want that open tent cheap bastard to choke or sink
No percent of my squad pretending we large
We from M-A-double dollar dawg, defendin' like guards
And sendin' them charts, from beginnin' them dots was short
Men saw the consequences of pretending their thoughts
Could compare to ours, lord, my southpaw put your jaws in gauze
For gosh my draw is so large; no squad's messing with my crew
Yeah them's my dawgs, they got similar flows par
But them's my balls, similar broads, but yours is
Wearing my drawls, preparing hearts for MSE's cause, we the chosen
