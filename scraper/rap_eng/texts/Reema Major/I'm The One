[Verse 1: Reema Major]
I’m that chick and I’m that chick

[Verse 2: Reema Major]
The way I curve into my jeans (fifty), in my twenties (five)
When it comes to payin' em' attention
I ain’t spending a penny
Anybody I want it, I swear I want it like fast boy?
Go try me! I puts you know that I'mma pretty little girl that'll knock you out
Get that doughs what I’m about
Drop down to the ones that doubt. can’t take heat, don’t take this route
Yeah! I’m the youngest CEO, couldn’t show me with a free throw, oh no
Can’t see to the TO, she don’t want me with me, bro
You hate your bank account, I love my bank account
I’mma just go and buy it. Ain’t tripping on 'em now
I'm blessed than holly fever, hella cute and hella major
Any little thing that I want that I get
So I down my window, wave to the haters!

Chorus: (x2)
I’m get it on it, you know I’m on it, they say go!
Ain’t fucking on it, you know I run it, oh yeah go!
From the illest kid, every time you know, now go!
I'm the one
Nanananana boo boo
I’m the one!
