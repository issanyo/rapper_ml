[Mac Dre:]
Ugh
Ugh cutty this is the one
This is the one!
This isnt number two this is definitly number 1
Thizz is what it is

[Mac Dre:]
Let me get a thizzle so I can get to smackin
And beat this track up like it's a nigga in a snitch jacket
It's mackin in the throw back starter
Mustin in mayo on tha yayo white nada
Eric estrada on the bike tryna tackle me
Hit a quick right then I dip into applebees
I'm a thug partna
Beat the blood out ya
Nah I'm just playin can a nigga get a dub out ya
I'm a club hoppa catch me in the parkin lot
Somethin new milleni or tha old school barkin hot
I start and stop stop and start
Push the dart squash the lark
My name is mac dre and I don't give a fuck
If you really want me baby give it up
Give it up
Give a fuck
I'm a drunk and an alchy
I need life insurance cause she sucked the life out me

[Chorus:]
We S-T-U-P-I-D
When we goto the club we don't need id
Everywhere we go it's a party ya'll
We gon get it crackin like the mardi gras

[Mac Dre:]
Maan even back when I was a 20 sack buya
I was el flamo partna I had fire
Bumpin like a bad choir
Hutches used to ADmire
Tha way I rocked tha mic on that bombay saphirre
Down like a flat tire
Heated like a flat iron
Had a benz and a lexus but not a jaguar
Cutty I slap fire
When they talk back
Oh this watch and the chain
The hutch bought that
Mac dre fought back
For position
In this rap game I was really on a mission
From reno to richmond
My teams known for pimpin
Decon the poison
And kilo the henchman
We known for the tension
We'll tear the club up
Giggin so hard boy we tear the rug up
My cuttys lookin smooth
Dance out his pants
They try to fuck with him but they don't stand a chance

[Chorus]
