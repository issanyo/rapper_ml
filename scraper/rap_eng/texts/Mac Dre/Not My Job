[Verse 1]
Dre rock the jewelry with the clear stones
And get on a nigga head like some headphones
I'm finna spit it with a clear tone
Get your attention
The biggest thing since the TV invention
Dope as Zoloft, a big shot, a show off
Plus, I'm a big pimp, I get tore off
Fuck a good job, she need a good jaw
To sell BJs 'til her mouth get raw
I'm from the California coast, beaches and bridges
Hit the cock, get ghost, I don't be sleeping with bitches
I got a Cougnut, sitting on wires
On vogues, bitch, not Michelin tires
Can't control my desires
I buy from Nordstrom's, not Fred Meyer's
I do a lot of weed, love my supplier
She keep it, fuck the blood out my supplier
Man, I'm bigger than life, I do it Magnum
And 'bout these broke bitches, I'm through with having 'em
Dre bogard, he shove and he push
And start a war for nothing like G.W. Bush
We be loving the kush, but only in the Backwood
Without a Backwood, it ain't all that good
I'm from the streets, where most need heat
But I'll slice a nigga up like some roast beef meat

[Hook]
I can bust you a rap, but anything else, not my job
I'll peel your cap back, but anything else, not my job
I'll get you for racks, but anything else, not my job
I'll make you a slap, but anything else is not my job

[Verse 2]
Bitch gon' ask me to come with her to grocery shop
I told her straight up like this, no siree Bob
That's not my job, I don't do that
I'm a pimp slash rapper, I thought you knew that
And where your dude at? Should I serve him the news
And let him know he's finna be walking in some brand new shoes?
Ooh, you a fool, gotta watch thyself
One false move and can't stop thyself
Sometimes I'm not myself, I'm another man
I'm a rockstar, in another band
Plus, I'm the man with the plan in his hands
Soon, we all playing in sand
'Cause to my estimations and these calculations
And all the money I made off The Rompalation
I'm finna get as many digits that's on a license plate
And shit on some of these midgets, bitch, I can't wait

[Hook]
I can bust you a rap, but anything else, not my job
I'll peel your cap back, but anything else, not my job
I'll get you for racks, but anything else, not my job
I'll make you a slap, but anything else is not my job

[Verse 3]
When I dip, they trip off what Furl dressed in
Plus, I got a mouth full of girl's best friend
I'm a Back to the Future, new game kind of nigga
Y'all lames is plain, drinking the same kind of liquor
Wearing the same kind of clothes, fucking the same kind of hoes
And you Bedrock pimping, meaning your game's kind of old
And you don't want it with me, I'll bother ya
So get lost, pal, before I clobber ya
I got golden gloves, I'll give you a new look
With a stiff left and a sharp right hook
Niggas know snitches, they ride and they go with them
It's all gravy, as long as they don't tell on them
Me and my team, see, we a machine
You fuck with my mans, and I'ma have to intervene
I'm a sport coat and a sancho, always looking out for Benny Blanco
