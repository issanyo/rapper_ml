[Intro]
Mac muthafuckin' Dre, bitch
Back through here, doing something vicious
Spittin' that shit that ya like
You know, this what I want y'all to do
Check this out...

[Verse 1]
Light yourself a dank joint, letcha mind go
Listen to these lyrics as I let this rhyme flow
I'm funky with this shit 'cause my style is authentic
It keeps them suckas jockin', so my windows stay tinted
I meant it when I said "I will pimp til I die"
Makin' them bitches cry
And nigga, dont ask me why
I flow that pimp shit 'cause I know that pimp shit
I smoke that hemp shit, not with that simp shit
Stupid doo-doo dumb is the only way I come
Let the track ride, gimme the mic and I'll run
Smooth with the groove like a saxophone
My raps is on, and man, caps is blown
Straight off suckas' heads with the rhymes I shoot
Fuckin' with the bitch if she's kinda cute
I find her loot, I shake the spot
You'll never hear a bitch say I ate the cot
I mack, kick back, and stack that cash
I throw these thangs, fool, don't make me tap that ass
The Mac named Dre is the man for real
Hoes wanna ride in me Sedan DeVille
'Cause I'm a, young playa with that Crestside game
Kickin' the funky shit, making the rest sound lame

[Chorus]
And every time I rap, I bust what cha like
'Cause I'm the coldest MC to ever touch a mic
Every time I rap, I bust what cha like
'Cause I'm the coldest MC to ever touch a mic

[Verse 2]
They trips when I spits 'cause I'm nothing respectable
But still when I spill, boy, I'm nothing correctable
I got raps that make niggas say "Goddamn
He a fool with the mic in his hand"
I could teach a square everything he's lackin'
'Cause partna, I'm a playa with some uncut mackin'
I spit shit that makes tricks go run and hide
Down them clowns around town, they wonder why
I never give a bitch who ain't rich the time of day
They got me fucked up if they think that I'ma pay
I'ma play, until she's all played out
Have her friends sayin' "Damn girl, you Mac Dre'd out!"

[Chorus]
'Cause every time I rap, I bust what cha like
'Cause I'm the coldest MC to ever touch a mic
Every time I rap, I bust what cha like
'Cause I'm the coldest MC to ever touch a mic

[Verse 3]
At the drop of a dime, I can rhyme a tight rap
And make a motherfucker say "Damn, he like that"
Gifted with the tongue that will run for many miles
Gettin' niggas sprung 'cause I come with many styles
Hoes come in rows to get chose, they gettin' wit me
Saying I'm the flyest on the side of the Mississippi
Banned in six states by the surgeon general
I'm known to be addictive, sellin' dope subliminals
And I don't stop servin' like them fools at Denny's
Like Julius Erving, Michael Jordan, and Penny
I go coast to coast with a dose of this realness
Slappin' your brain with this game, can you feel this?
I flow like river water, ain't no nigga harder
Others that was rockin' is forgotten like Jimmy Carter
But I'm gon' be around, just like hand-me-downs
An old-ass playa still pullin' them panties down

[Chorus]
And every time I rap, I bust what cha like
'Cause I'm the coldest MC to ever touch a mic
Every time I rap, I bust what cha like
'Cause I'm the coldest MC to ever touch a mic
