[Mac Dre]
Ugh
Ugh cutty this is the one
This is the one!
This isn't number two this is definitely THA one
Thizz is what it is!

[Verse 1]
Let me get a thizzle so I can get to smackin
And beat this track up like it's a nigga wit a snitch jacket
It's mackin in the throw back Starter
Mustard and mayo on tha yayo white nada
Eric Estrada on the bike tryna tackle me
Hit a quick right then I dip into Applebee's
I'm a thug partna
Beat the blood out ya
Nah I'm just playin' can a nigga get a dub out ya?
I'mma club hoppa catch me in the parkin' lot
Somethin new milleni or tha old school barkin' hot
I start and stop, stop and start
Push the dart, squash the lark
My name is Mac Dre and I don't give a fuck
If you really want me, baby give it up, give it up
Give a fuck, I'm a drunk and an alchy
I don't need life insurance cause she sucked the life out me

[Chorus x2]
We S-T-U-P-I-D
When we go to the club we don't need I.D
Everywhere we go it's a party y'all
We gon' get it crackin' like the Mardi Gras

[Verse 2]
Man even back when I was a 20 sack buya
I was el flamo, partna I had fire
Bumpin' like a bad choir
Hutches used to admire
Tha way I rocked tha mic on that Bombay Sapphire
Down like a flat tire
Heated like a flat iron
Had a Benz and a Lexus, but not a Jaguar
Cutty I slap fire
When they talk back
Oh this watch and the chain
The hutch bought that
Mac Dre fought back
For position
In this rap game I was really on a mission
From Reno to Richmond
My teams known for pinchin'
De-Con the poison
And Kilo the henchman
We known for the tension
We tear the club up
Giggin' so hard boy we tear the rug up
My cutty's lookin smooth
Dance out his pants
They try to fuck with him but they don't stand a chance

[Chorus]
