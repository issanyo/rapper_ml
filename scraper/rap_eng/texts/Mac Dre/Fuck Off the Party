[Verse 1: Mr. Taylor]
What's up, what's up, let's ride
Jump in the passenger side on the 4th of July
Hella saucy and fly, didn't grind that day
I just wanted to play
And smoke with the bitches
Throw phrases at bitches
Get play from the bitches
Man, it was major bitches
At the Pleasanton fair
Ass was over here, over there
I had to stop and stare
Take a joint from my ear
Tell this bitch to come here
Let's breathe
And we even tricked the cops, though the smell of the weed
That's when they grabbed my sleeve
Told me it's time to leave
But what's next, "You're under arrest"
So I grabbed the fuckin' cop and slapped him on his fuckin' bulletproof vest
In the process lost a shoe, ripped a hole in my Guess
That's what the fuck I get for smokin' Mexican stress

(B-I-E-I-itch, I will never switch)(Repeat 4X)

[Verse 2: King Saan]
I'm at the bar doin' big shit, gettin' big lit
My niggas, dig this
A few cats lookin' like they wanna get with
So I give 'em a chance real quick, I'm real swift
It's the Wild Wild West, ask Will Smith who will peel the snitch
That howled the name that blew the brain
For foul-snitchin the game
I know my nigga Dre would do the same
So I ain't trippin' on a motherfuckin' thang
Sit back shinin' like a diamond ring
Niggas wanna see me hang
So I'm upside down, about to clown
Real gangsta shit lost and found
Kidnapped, blast in the back of the dome
Mash in a Brougham
Flashin on the phone, yelllin niggas be tellin
Flowin' like water from a melon
The seeds we spit, the seeds we sellin'
From a westbound felon
Fuckin' up your party not carin'
From a westbound felon
Fuckin' up your party not carin'
From a westbound felon

(B-I-E-I-itch, I will never switch)(Repeat 4X)

[Verse 3: Mac Dre]
I'm at a concert high and perked with a bad bitch next to me
Blown back off Cognac, that bomb green and ecstacy
Bitches is buggin', niggas is muggin'
But bitches is lovin 'cause niggas is thuggin'
These niggas start nuttin' in the corner by the speaker
My beeper's goin' off like crazy
The scene is hazy, no time to be lazy
Got to stay on my toes, all of a sudden these hoes
Come out of nowhere and grab this nigga
They stab this nigga, I'm mad this nigga
Didn't have nothin' in his pockets when I ran through 'em
My plans is ruined, what is it I'm doin?
Looks on the flo'...no, it's not
Stupid motherfucker done dropped his Rolex watch
Put it in my pocket, proceeded to the exit
That's when this bitch I knew from the hood came through in this Lexus
I seen these other niggas beatin' down this one fool
I said, "Here come the police, y'all better run, fool"
Soon as I said that the police drew down on us all
Now I'm at the county jail with just one phone call
Ain't that a bitch, weak-ass night
All fucked up behind a weak-ass fight

(B-I-E-I-itch, I will never switch)(Repeat until the end)
