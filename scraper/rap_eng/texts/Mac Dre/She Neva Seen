[Verse 1]
It was a hot night in August, (a hot August night), humid
Hit the store to get some O.J. to shroom with
Ooh, shitty, I'm in the world's biggest little city
Seen a girl with some big ass titties
A top notch saditty, bitch knew she was pretty
Get goosed in the city, get your purse took
When I stepped in her life she felt the earth shook
Before I spit the first hook, let me lace ya
Fucked her, had her crying like somebody maced her
Gave her a taste of some real macaroni
She swore she would do, anything for me
That's no bologna, baby brought me bread
Freaked me on the freeway on the 80, gave me head
She neva seen, a sav in some Timbs
Push an S5 sittin' on some Davin rims

[Verse 2]
Listen, you wouldn't want to miss this
I met this bitch the night before Christmas
Baby made my hit list Christmas night
She let a nigga hit by the Christmas lights
This bitch was tight, just my type
Barely ripe, ride a dick like a bike
Hit a dick like a pipe, quick late night hype
Them the kinda thangs that makes my night
The steak ain't right without the A-1
So I stay dipped in sauce and they come
Like baby did, like that nigga old lady did
Like Karen, Kameka, and Katie did
It's crazy, kid, mami on my bozack
I'm pimpin' and she knows that
Nigga, where the hoes at?
Bet they neva seen, a sav in Timbs
Push an S5 sittin' on some Davin rims

[Verse 3]
Me and Black Jesus went to Rosaritas
Seen senoritas eating carnitas
I was rocking my Adidas sneakers
Told the waitress, "get me fajitas"
Gold teethas, left her speechless
Gave me the number with a Fairfield prefix
Dipped to the Cougar, put up the Ruger
In the stash spot, a wise maneuver
Put up the cougar, pulled out the MB
California Hot Boy, MD
The boss, that do the firing and hiring
Sweat a broad, I keep 'em perspiring
She's admiring the way I slide
The way I ride, and how her boyfriend lied
She's neva seen a sav in Timbs
Push an S500 sittin' on some Davin rims

[Ending Hook 2X]
She only sees me, with European keys
She only sees me, with woodgrain Sprees
She only sees me, with Champelli trees
She only sees me, having hella G's
