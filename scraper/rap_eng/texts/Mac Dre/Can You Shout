Can you shout?, Let me hear you scream
We some fiends, for heem and sticky green
Can you shout?, Let me hear you scream
We some fiends, for heem and sticky green

We don't like broke bitches, We don't like brown weed
We don't like no snitches, take the police on high speeds
We don't like broke bitches, We don't like brown weed
We don't like no snitches, take the police on high speeds

Policeman got me on the run (policeman got me on the run)
Knowin' damn well that I'm not the one (knowing damn well I ain't the one)
Errywhere I go I gotta take my gun (errywhere I go I gotta take my gun)
Errybody know that I'm they doe when I just tryin' to have some fun, Can you dig it?

Put the guns in the trunk, come and listen to some slump
You never know cuddie, you might bump
A silver dolla, tryin to holla
Put'ya in a Benz, get'cha out that Impala
Pop a colla, Nah that's old
Dust yourself off, like bases been stole
I so cold, I'm so cool
Call me Morris Dre the Cutthoat fool

We don't like broke bitches, We don't like brown weed
We don't like no snitches, make the police on high speeds
We don't like broke bitches, We don't like brown weed
We don't like no snitches, make the police on high speeds

Policeman got me on the run (policeman got me on the run)
Knowin' damn well that I'm not the one (knowing damn well I ain't the one)
Errywhere I go I gotta take my gun (errywhere I go I gotta take my gun)
Errybody know that I'm they doe when I just tryin' to have some fun
Can you dig it?
