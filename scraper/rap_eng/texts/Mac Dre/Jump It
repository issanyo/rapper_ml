[Hook x2]
Baby over there can you do the thizzle wiggle?
Baby over there let me see that booty jiggle
(Jump it, Jump it)

Whatever you're doing cutty, put it on pause
I just made some phone calls to some thong broads
Long jaws, skullery queens
That's boss if you don't know what skullery means
If you really want to get some cock, meet me at the Mission Rock
I'll be in the back with two bitches doing the twist and pop
Twist and pop, booty drop the oopty-ah
I'll be thizz dancin, shakin my dookie locks
Watchin' coochie-cock, pop, shake and wiggle
Mommy havin fun, she giggle like it tickle
Dump truck booty, rump plump cutie
Giggin' so hard, making faces like she pooting

[Hook]

I'm lampin', perkin' off the Remy
Dancing with baby in the dental floss bikini
Wow, she's letting it all out
Her man find out, bet ya they fall out
They hate it, I make 'em dance X-rated
Get 'em faded, thizzle, Drizzle, related
Hello, would you look at that jello
She don't need no music, she can do it acapello
DJ cut it and mellow, I got one in stilettos
I want to show her my new dance:  "The Abbot and Costello"
I'm on another level, boy I'm passed drunk
Furley getting with girlies that backin that ass up

[Hook]

I want a chick that breaks off the chips
Something thick from Rick's House of Tricks
One that can get low, work that strip pole
A Mitchell Brother broad from San Francisco
A stripper from Portland, a cute soft one
One that work at The Dolphin on McLaughlin
A lady or two from The Crazy Horse II
A yo-tal that works at Coco's
I want a lady from the Mexican channel
That got more back than a motha fuckin camel
A pretty ho, from a rap video
One that can make her ass and titty go
Jump jump, bounce bounce
Jump jump, bounce bounce
I want a girl gone wild, with her own style
Something with da-donk-donk and blabl-OW!
