[Chorus 4X]
It don’t matter how you do it, when you do it, who you do it wit’
Long as it’s that freaky shit

[Verse 1]
Never question profession since I was an adolescent
To females, here’s a suggestion when it comes to the dick
I make draft picks, the ones who cum too quick
And the ones that hang with it
Watchin’ hoes hate ‘cause can’t handle this
Rollin’ on a hot night and lookin’ jiggy
Checkin’ my pockets, nothin’ less than a fifty; niggas feel me
Step in the club, niggas and broads wall-to-wall
Step to the bar to get my swerve on, Henny with a straw
What I’m in the mood for when it comes to my nut, I’m hardcore
Send the Mo to the table by the dancefloor
Walk through the crowd, gettin’ jocked with my crew
Somebody’s popped the Mo ‘cause somebody’s gettin’ screwed
Let me get my stroll on, so I can see who’s bold
Because this pussy I got here, yeah, it’s platinum gold
And my lips on swole as you explode
Beggin’ for the ass once more and now you know the shit’s no joke
Give me five hund’ because baby I need some smoke
Pussy-whipped, so fake niggas, they can’t cope

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
69 ways turn into a 1-38
From the dining room table, I’m watchin’ you masturbate
Turn that ass over and assume the position
Either it’s a stickin’ or a hellafied freaky lickin’
Oh, you ain’t knowin’ ‘bout this mackin’ ass P
I be that Infamous sista from the S-A-C, bitch
Blaze my muthafuckin’ blunt in a set
And all you playa hatin’ hoes, you can give Mac Dre head
All you hatin’ ass niggas, keep your eyes on your bitch
One time is all it takes and she’ll be lickin’ on my clit, ha ha

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Mac Dre]
You got yours first but don’t trip
Don’t stop, let’s continue
Play with my nuts while I’m diggin’ in deep up in you
You ain’t no punk, ugh, girl, you’s a freak
On your stomach while I’m divin’, you squeezin’ booty cheeks
Now switch ‘em up, hit ‘em up in the air and open wide
Let me slide and glide before you ride
This a trip, damn, baby, you hella sick
Put her mouth to the pussy to the booty back to the mouth slurpin’ hella dick
You hella wet, ugh, and gettin’ moister
You on gin, ginseng, hop, and smoked oysters
Stupid doo doo, you got voodoo, bitch, I think you cursed
The way you stripped and pulled that big dildo out your purse
Joogin’ and jabbin’, stabbin’, havin’ a ball
Jackin’ off, soundin’ hella soft
You got a husband? You married and doin’ sneaky shit?
But don’t trip, beyatch, this that freaky shit

[Chorus]
