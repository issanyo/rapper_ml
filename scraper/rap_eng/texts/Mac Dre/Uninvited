[Intro]

[Verse 1]
Thirty-one double-O-seven was the code I got hit wit'
I guess it's time to go and do that Looie shit
Stopped at the spot and then hit the sto'
Because the gin and ice got me perkin' in the studio
When I hit the spot tops drop Glocks cocked
I hope it ain't no funk cause the Looies on the block
Hope you're givin' up love, or givin' up dap
The homie from the Looies is quick to pull your cap

[Verse 2]
Thirty-one double-O-seven was the code I got hit wit'
I guess it's time to go and do some more Looie shit
Gotta hit the store and get me a Vega
Cause you know when a Looie smoke, a Looie smoke major
We push in doors, snatch C-U drawers
Took over stores and mack punk trick whores
My Looies done paged and I'm smashin'
Blowin' big bomb in a fashion
We be doin' this shit with a passion
And your bitch blew me off for straight mackin'

[Verse 3]
Now what you gone do when I hit that C-U
Give up the money or get Big Bar after you
Ric' ain't for play, the Glock is gone spit
And chop a nigga like a trick
Crestside nigga on the real-a, all about my scrilla
Dope rhymesayer out the town an- (and I'm a peel ya?)
So don't test the thirty-one double-O-seven vet
Wreck the playa haters off they set
Back 'em up cause ain't nathan but that C-side
And we ride so deep, playa hatas run and hide
It's high performance when we slide
You might catch me in that fifty drive
Crestside nigga in this game it won't stop
Back 'em up, cause niggas know we hiccup
Them fifty-caliber Eagles, dumpin' out that Regal
It's Rico, you know, nathan nice from the North Pole
Backin' niggas down for real, that's how I get that scrill

[Verse 4]
Damn, I left my mask at home
Should I straight face this fool or just leave 'em alone?
Nah, it ain't like that
It's the Looie Crew nigga and I'm out to get fat
Fat is what I'm talkin' bout, a hundred Gs or betta'
Witnesses, they'll all get wet up
Uh! Nobody left to tell
All you snitch ass niggas get sent straight to Hell
Uh!

[Hook]
Looie, Looie, Looie, Looie
Looie, Looie, Looie, Looie

[Verse 5: Mac Dre]
I used to sell yayo on the streets of the three Cs
But now I slang game on cassettes and CDs
I rips and flips cats with stacks of raw raps
Attack them saps that steady flaps and jaw-jack
I'm all that, and I got Mac Mall's back
Fumbled in ninety-two but now I got the ball back
And runnin' suckas over with that R-A-P
Cause I'm the M-V-P, and a G, from the V
They can't see me cause I'm in too deep
Sellin' em half a million like my boy Jay Tee
And really representin' that Northern Cali, hoe
I'm from the Crest, north side of Vally-joe
Up from the O, down to San Jo'
Up to Sacto, up to Frisco
Everybody knows Mac Dre's a factor
Takin' this rap thang to the next chapter
I rap to funky beats that rock ya
Made by Khayree, brotha of the Rocker
I sock ya with these blows of game
That's potent like a joint of that doja mayne
Doja mayne, doja mayne
It's the Looie Crew nigga, never fuck with caine

[Hook]
Looie Crew, Looie Crew, Looie Crew, Looie Crew
What you gonna do when [?] come for you?
Looie Crew, Looie Crew, Looie Crew, Looie Crew
What you gonna do when [?] come for you?

[Chorus]
I ride by with my fists high in the sky
And bust U-ies, and only smoke with the Looies
I ride by with my fists high in the sky
And bust U-ies, and only smoke with the Looies
