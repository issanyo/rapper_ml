[Verse 1]
I'm a hutch-peeler with much scrilla and I love to get high, homie
Shady character like Don King, so you better keep your eye on me
I done bust niggas in the grill and had 'em wearin' partials
Jacked high rollers and ran from the US Marshals
It's called survival, and only the strong can survive
And went the distance with the feds while some of my partners took a dive
Strive to stay alive, can't let no nigga smother me
Got to stay F-R-double-E and keep these bitches lovin' me
Sippin' bubbly, breakin' down buds from a fat sack
Reservations at Crustaceans or Art's Crab Shack
I stacks fat 'cause a macaroni gots to have cheese
Puttin' pillows in cigarillos and Backwood leaves
And I drinks Heem by the gallon, so sometimes I might trip
Infrared beam with black talons and that extended clip
Quick to do some sprayin', so nigga, watch what you sayin'
You'll get your show cancelled like Keenen Ivory Wayans

[Hook]
I'm just a pimp, mayne, tryin' to stack some Funyuns
So I can have French maids pedicure my bunions
Oh, you ain't knowin', what is you, new?
Yo hutch must be feedin' you fish head stew
Fish head stew
Fish head stew
Fish head stew
Fish head stew
Fish head stew

[Verse 2]
Mac Dre shake broke hoes with boatloads of kids
Tell a bitch she can take a long walk off a short bridge
And hope she land in shark-infested waters
Heartless, takin' over turfs like Nino did the Carters
Kidnapped by the Feds and treated like a sucker
But now I'm free they see payback's a motherfucker
I'm stickin' my dick in all they daughters and nieces
Now CO's and PO's want me restin' in pieces
Hittin' pieces so hard that it'll make your nose bleed
And I been smokin' since niggas was on gold weed
Born to be a player, rhyme-sayer and clock grits
Strapped with two 23 spittin' chop sticks
Quick to kick a bitch to the curb
And get back with her on a 33rd
I never worry, never worry, it's all copacetic
Got mo' game than needed insulin in a diabetic

[Hook]
I'm just a pimp, mayne, tryin' to stack some Funyuns
So I can have French maids pedicure my bunions
Oh, you ain't knowin', what is you, new?
Yo hutch must be feedin' you fish head stew
Fish head stew
Fish head stew
Fish head stew
Fish head stew
Fish head stew

[Verse 3]
I be fitted, dipped in butter, hair cut like Kobe
Blindin' hoes with science like Thomas Dolby
Pullin' on black and milds, sippin' top-shelf Cuervo
Playin' with my hutch hair while she lickin' on my navel
Stable full of money-makin' stallions
Been in the feds with dreads from Jamaica and Italians
Shrimp scampi eater, Peter long as the Love Boat
Puffin purple kush at the building with my cuzzo
Strapped, armed, ready, ain't nobody goosin' me
Got Roll-Os hid in my load where the airbags used to be
Boy, you should see how I act off the privilege
Hennessy, it's like Popeye's spinach
I'm ready to take heads off, gunplay or fight
I dot eyes and have 'em wearin' they sunglasses at night
Fool, that's real, that ain't no frontin'
Them punk-ass niggas don't wanna see Dre about nothin'

[Hook]
I'm just a pimp, mayne, tryin' to stack some Funyuns
So I can have French maids pedicure my bunions
Oh, you ain't knowin', what is you, new?
Yo hutch must be feedin' you fish head stew
Fish head stew
Fish head stew
Fish head stew
Fish head stew
Fish head stew

I'm just a pimp, mayne, tryin' to stack some Funyuns
So I can have French maids pedicure my bunions
Oh, you ain't knowin', what is you, new?
Yo hutch must be feedin' you fish head stew
Fish head stew
Fish head stew
Fish head stew
Fish head stew
Fish head stew
