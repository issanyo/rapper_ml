[Verse 1]
I'm a different kind of human
You can catch me shroomin'
Drunk in the bucket, beats blasting and boomin'
Sound tuning while I'm clownin and cooning
Polo cologning while you nigga's perfuming
I'm connected with jew men, only fuck with a few men
Campaign with this game, mayne, like Truman
Puffing a Cuban, fucking with Rueben
Stayin' a traffic while bitches saying "Where you been?"
I'm groovin', movin' with Gucci on my shoes
Braking then cruising, the coochie I'm abusing
I'm amazing, sometimes I'm amusing
I'll break six sisters named Susan

[Hook]
Can you hear me now? (Repeat 8X)

[Verse 2]
I'm a Nike shoe wearer
Hook Mikey up with Sarah
Be all in a bitch face like some mascara
Nigga, when I wear a, saucy fresh pair of
Gucci's, I'm a tennis shoe pimp on a terror
Had a beezy named Lara, replaced her with Farrah
She had a Carrera, she was well taken care of
No errors, runs or hits
Strikes I pitch, I swing for the fence
I'm mean in the clinch, tighten like a wrench
That nigga at the plate, you don't like him, I can pinch
I'm hyphy and convinced, hyphy and convinced

[Hook]
Can you hear me now? (Repeat 8X)
