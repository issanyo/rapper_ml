(feat. Mac Dre)

[Mac Dre: Talking]
Serving fat game that you'll never imagine
Boy I can talk a cat off a fish wagon
Or sell an Eskimo ice at a high price and get him twice
Man I not that nice, and games my merchandise
I grime rhymes like bass rocks a "89"
Lacing young playas getting ready for shady times
No shady rhymes you're garented to love it
And since I got so much of it, its gonna cost to dub it
So get ya scrilla, ya fetti, ya scarth, and yo mail
And holla at me folks, I got game for sale

[Verse 1]
Mothafuckas jock me cuz I'm dope when I be flowing
Suckas try to stop me, but im honking keep on going
Im simply not the type that likes to kick it with a square
I kick it with the bitch cuz filthy rich cuz im gone play here
Time and time again man niggas always ask me
Why do hoe's jock you when you spit raps so nasty
I look them in the eye and I reply to the question
Game is to be thought so let me teach yo ass a lesson
Bitches love niggas who can pop a lot of shit
Sprung off the tongue so they jock for the dick
I never met a broad who didn't like the way I laced her
Poured this hoe some game and served this pimpin as a chaser
Fools can't understand about the shit I teach in a verse
Rapping about that bitch and how she reached in her purse
It takes a true playa to really recognize
Its all about the money not the shit between the thighs
Suckas love pussy more than money cuz they show it
They eat it and retreat and they even pay for it
I truly don't know why those fools be salting up the game
Real niggas pimp but you don't here me man
I know this mothafucka who won't hesitate to hit a bitch
A right to the jaw is what I saw when he got with his bitch
Showing no mercy for those hoes who be flossing
Acting like they all that when they only good for tossing
I feel the same way about those bitches that be faking
Hoes ain't shit unless they bringing home the bacon
And if its like that then I act like I love the ho
But when im not with her man I dicking down another ho
Playas know that I flow is nothing but that real shit
Fuck those faking broads man get you a real bitch

[Chorus]
I don't be bull shiting with the game that im spittin
So pay attention to this game that you getting
Its kind of foul but some say wow
But I be serving it real the only way I know how

[Verse 2]
As I put don't this demo know you when you I hear no
Sucka shit out these lips but I bet you'll hear mo
Styles and techniques shit to catch freaks
If ya lacking macking homeboy you best beat
I serve it the right way, those broads who like Dre
Im giving baby action if im thinking she might pay
I might play, with the body and soul
And have her doing every got damn thing she told
I manipulate than stipulate
The rules then I use every grip she makes
Im a playa in this game but professional
And if you ain't shit bitch im going to let you know
Then im gone let you go ho cuz I don't need ya
Take them, break them, shake them
Is a pimp's procedure
Simps they feed ya be glad they g'd ya
Im going to seet back and analyze and read ya
Peeps potentials read percentiles
Then run a player check on your freak condenses
No time to play games with broads who say thangs
Its realer and I tell the bitch the shit the Dre brings
Is realer then Swiss cheese
Im out to get geez, if you ain't with it
Punk bitch then get these nuts in your mouth
No more no less
You fucking around with that pimp playa crest

[Chorus]
[Talking]
Spittin that real shit ya know
