[Intro: (Mac Dre) imitating a Middle Eastern convenience store clerk]
Hello my friend, How you do my friend? What would you like?
Yes, what would you like?
(I want uh... pack of Backwoods...pack of Backwoods
Give me a fifth of that privilege Hennessy and uh... thats it)
Thank you very very much

[Verse 1]
What you know about me? I'm Mac Dreezy
Call Hennessy heem and a blunt a bleezy
I keep a fat sack wrapped in a Backwood leaf
Smoke trees that make me look Japanese
Green seedless, mean when I'm weedless
Never in denial, I'm a fiend and I need this
Any day is a bad day for Mac Dre
When he ain't got it, they ask why he act that way
I smoke champ, kush and Naid
"Man, what's Naid?" Bomb that's sprayed
I can't fade a beezy who don't keep a bleezy
Rolled for a neezy
I ask her, 'What the feezy?'
I gotta have weed to go get weed
You don't like it, kiss my ass 'til your lips bleed
This one's for the club so I'm kinda like keeping it clean
Sing it with me y'all...

[Hook (x2)]
(Bleezies n heem)
I gots to have my dope
Everywhere I go (Bleezies n heem)
When they ask me, what's my drink?
I say heem, man, what you think?

[Verse 2]
I L-O-V-E H double-E M
I drink like ten of them things that swim
"He's heeming again" is what they say when I come around
I'll get dumb drunk and fuck up your compound
Your building, your establishment
Mobbin', saying "Cuddie, I'm hella bent"
Oh what a feeling when you're looking at the ceiling
And it's spinning and the earl starts spilling
I drink heem when I perk, don't like Erk and Jerk
It don't work, when a nigga chillin'
Might spill it on my Abercrombie Fitch
Know I got the man at the liquor store rich
Well baby would you please run and get...
Me another Hennessy fifth?
Bleezies n heem

[Hook]
(Bleezies n heem)
I gots to have my dope
Everywhere I go (Bleezies n heem)
When they ask me, what's my drink?
I say heem, man, what you think?
(Bleezies n heem)
I gots to have my dope
Everywhere I go (Bleezies n heem)
When they ask me, what I drink
I say heem, man, what you think?
(Bleezies n heem)

[Verse 3]
Fire up, lets get drunk
Get your cup, fill it up, don't be no punk
A party ain't a party if every damn body
Ain't lifted and a little bit tipsy
But don't drink and drive, I remember one time
My cuddie Joogy, wrapped his fifty, rap this with me
And if you don't understand
You a inbred, your daddy and your uncle was the same man
I gotta have dope everywhere I go
When they ask me what I drink I say, "Heem, what you think?"
I gets heem in me, only substitute is RÃ©my
In Sac with Jimmy, or in Portland with Kenny
I'm danked out, dranked out, can't talk, can't count
If I want some more I'm making baby pull her bank out
You cool on the bomb? What do you mean?
Sing it to him y'all...
