[Chorus (Repeat 2X): Warren G]
Fast money, might be ya last money
Quick to blast for the cash money
Squabbin' over past money
Lookin' for spots to stash money
Fast money, might be ya last money

[Verse 1: Dutches]
Every time I meet a niggaro, they ass wanna hit
And you tell them 'HELL NO!,' they ass go to talkin' shit
I never gave a flyin' fuck on how these niggas feelin'
Just because I let him eat the pussy now he think we dealin'
Slow down honey love, I think you better pump yo' brakes
If you had that feelin' that we was makin' love, that feelin's fake
My pussy's tight, that's why you niggas want to get up in it
Just to talk to me it cost a fee so nigga won't you spend it
Never trust these fools hollerin' they single
Bitches, dont be stupid, they be lyin'
You know these niggas mingle
You bitches got it bad fuckin' niggas on the first night
Then hollerin' that shit about how a man don't treat 'em right
Bitches be talkin' about fuckin' niggas, I'm buckin' niggas
To get closer to me is some lucky niggas with some scrilla
Niggas gotta break me off a lil somethin'
Playas gotta have that money pumpin'
Before we do some grindin' and bumpin'

[Chorus]

[Verse 2: Mac Dre]
I'm hungry for the cabbage, a swavage who need the bank
I done sold everything from weed to crank
But now I need to think, how many of my niggas got killed
Blood spilled, done dealed, cap peeled, for that fast scrill
My past will, pin a picture of criminal conduct
'Cause, nigga, when I'm stuck, my trigger comes unstuck
I don't give a fuck, nigga, life is a hustle
If you wanna come up, you got to flex that muscle
Niggas wit little hearts get little bread
Some niggas is satisfied with puss and a little head
'Til it's been said, fuck the bitch, get rich
Be about it, not without it, nigga get yo' grits
But be cautious 'cause it's crosses
Get caught up, brought up on charges and some take losses
Do your thang, sell dope, hit licks
Sometimes it's mandatory to get them quick grits

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Kokane]
My nigga Mac Dre sent a kite to me
He was in Lompoc, I was Tehachapi
The letter read: When we hook up we gonna have the fat sacks
(We gon' sell these raps like crack)
Nigga, I make big bread from the night time 'til it's sunny
Real gangsters don't brag about money
Nigga, this game I would love tall deals
Changin' our name from the mafia to corporate
('Cause it's like four in the mornin' in the kitchen, cookin' up dope on the grill)
Nigga, I keeps it real

[Chorus 4X]
