Smurf cut it up
Smurf cut it up
Smurf cut it up

[Verse 1]
She's broke as a joke, I don't want yo bitch
I want some rope and a gumbo mix
I Mutombo hits, slap a bitch out the air
It ain't fair I'm a California bear
Grizzly Adams, in a Benz on Davins
Thizzin', savin', gone off that log cabin
Hocus, pocus, DJ Macadoscious
Watch me turn these blunts into roaches
I come with doses, while Smurf cut it up
Let's nut it up and make punks shut it up
I rub it up, smack it up and dick down it down
Bustin' styles like clips and rounds
How you like me now? Fool, what it do?
It's Don't Hate the Player Part 2
How you like me now? Fool, what it do?
It's Don't Hate the Player Part 2

[Hook 4X]
If you hate the player, you hate the game

[Verse 2]
Man, you been actin' kinda strange lately
Because your bitch licked and ate me?
If you hate me, you hate the game
It's a fuckin' shame like what's his name
It's nothin', mayne, you didn't need her
She's raw, she jawed me in her two-seater
A two-liter in her mouth I busted
Shake the broad, dog, she can't be trusted
She put mustard on my hot dog
And paid a pimp before she shook the spot, dog
I'm top dog, don't hate it
Every rims I skated was chrome plated
I made it, I'm successful
And you hate it 'cause your life is so stressful
Things get a little easier
You gotta get cheesier and more peasier
