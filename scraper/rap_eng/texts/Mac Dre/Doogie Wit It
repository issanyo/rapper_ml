[Verse 1: Mac Dre]
I get on a nigga head like a New Era
Cancer, with dancers that look like Drew Berra
Pimp who wear a, new pair of Gucci's, I'm doogie
Spit like loogie, strapped with [?]
Yes, yes, best dressed, throwback like fresh, fresh
Been in everything from G5 to SS
Bad news, girls, guns and booze
Run with fools, ho's choose, come with tools
Who's the cleanest, meanest, genius
Dope as intravenous, shaking subpoenas
Al Boo Boo, too cool, wrote the old school
Yoke the new school in a [?]
In the Coug out, doog'd out
Wild child, my momma made me move out
Too loud, this a new route, follow me now
Ew, I hear the hook calling me now

[Hook: Mac Dre]
She cold on the pole, ew she hit it
Got stuy with it, said my movie did it
Said I'm like an uzi with it, when I spit it
She can't help it she got to get doogie wit it
Get doogie wit it
Get doogie wit it
Get doogie wit it
Get doogie wit it

[Verse 2: Mac Dre]
I'm trying to stay number one without stepping in number two
I'mma leave the house man my weapon is coming too
I'm real Cali, catch me in Mill Valley
In a [?] on some ill Rallys
I smell rich, look rich, look bitch
You heard the hook, a nigga trying to juk, bitch
No chump change here, keep [?] near
Ride Benz' and Beamers, no Mustangs here
We roll Euro, I'm so thorough
Squat to the Marriott with your girlo
Man I'm drunk I've had to many martinis
Took a wrong turn and now I'm in the boonies
But all my whips is navigated, my screens is animated
Everything is automated, them niggas got to hate it
Pablo made it, Mr. Full Blood
It made me doog up and tear the booth up

[Hook: Mac Dre]
She cold on the pole, ew she hit it
Got stuy with it, said my movie did it
Said I'm like an uzi with it, when I spit it
She can't help it she got to get doogie wit it
Get doogie wit it
Get doogie wit it
Get doogie wit it
Get doogie wit it

[Verse 3: Mac Dre]
All these rhymes I've been dropping
Keep me diamond shopping
And you wouldn't believe the weed I've been copping
Straight grade, call me the grape ape
That ain't a Backwood man, wait, wait
I drive with no license, see [?]
Want it, buy it, no matter what the price is
Nigga with dreads from the city on the edge
Smoke nigga like Benson and Hedges
Give me a Remy with a lemon wedge
I'm trying to get my nuts sucked like Lemon Heads
I got the feeling with the biggest stunta's in the building
"Thizz what that is?" Uh, I'm just chilling
I look in the mirror, it tell me I'm cool
What you expected? Resect it, Bay Area fool
Shut up, light the blunt and let doobie hit it
Turn up the beat and let's get doogie wit it

[Hook: Mac Dre]
She cold on the pole, ew she hit it
Got stuy with it, said my movie did it
Said I'm like an uzi with it, when I spit it
She can't help it she got to get doogie wit it
Get doogie wit it
Get doogie wit it
Get doogie wit it
Get doogie wit it
