Knick knack patty wack, give your hoe some donkey
Listen to the bassline, don't it sound funky?
Who could it be in the place to stay?
That's right, hoe, Mac muthafuckin’ Dre
One more time back in your ear
Those dope ass raps you love to hear
Cold as ice, nothin’ nice
If I thrust ya once, hoe, I’mma thrust ya twice
That's right, and you know the deal
You don't want the baby, hoe, take the pill
‘Cause I'mma bust fadles back to back
And when I get tired, I'mma take a nap
And when I wake up, I'mma bath some more
It's the same routine until It's time to go
You, get what’s in my drawls, and girl I get those sugar walls
Oh, you didn't know about me?
The A the N the D the R the E
Well, peep game, it goes like this
I hold my mic tight like my dick when I piss
Cause when it comes to cot, girl, I won't clean it
Always got my damn hat to the muthafuckin’ jimmy
Cold, bold, 19 years old
With a brain full of game to be told
I'm from the V-town, 3 C down
And a sucka don't wanna see me clown
Who (who) could it be?
That’s right, Mac Dre, ba-by
Funky fresh, in the flesh
It's me, Khayree and my joint of sess
Doin’ it, like a porno star
Hittin’ in your box, or in your car
Cool, like the sweat from a snowman
Kick back, relax and listen, here we go, man
To the land of the dope rhyme
And as the song flows on, I really hope I’m
Not too dirty or rap too strong
But my mouthpiece is really goin’ on
From Vallejo, California all the way to China
Hoes of the world, know I’m a
Stone cold mack with a gift to spit
Nothin’ but that dope shit
So damn fly, don't ask me why
I smoke Indo and I smoke Thai
Mac Dre, I thought you knew
Down and dirty doin’ things that only playas can do
The coldest MC on this here Earth
Had to be fresh from the Crestside turf (Crestside)
Not a Southside sucka who thinks he can rhyme
But a Crestside playa that's strapped with a 9
And it don't stop

I say microphone check 1, 2, 1, 2
It's young Mac Dre, right back at you
Wit’ another dose of that dope
You see, I’m way more potent than coke
The young fly brotha’s on the mic, y’all
I’m finna rock this muthafucka all night, y’all
And just spittin’ and dope shittin’
And to a nice, smooth beat that’s hittin’
Cold as ice, clean as soap
I keep a fresh bag of zags in my Derby coat
24 hours around the clock
7 days a week, I’m on a prowl for cot
Day in, day out, I spit and shout
A true blue mack, know what I’m talkin’ about?
It’s just game (game), straight game (game)
Kick back, let it soak in your brain (mane)
Listen to me spit that pimpin’ tip
I put the money to the wallet and the pussy to the dick
Stack a bank, slap a pack
Put my muthafuckin’ tape in ya goddamn deck
Man, take a bitch, break a bitch
And when you're all done, cuddy, man, shake the bitch
Straight high-sidin’ when you come through squat
Leave a muthafuckin’ cloud in the parking lot
Load the brains, do some thangs
Put the mounts on your fingers, man, fuck the chains
Play that hoe like a game of checkers
Treat her like dirt, take her money and wreck her
‘Cause a hoe, ain’t no good (no good)
Whip her punk ass? Man, I sho’ would
It’s ’90, you gotta be def
Take all the money until there ain’t none left
You see, some young brothas give her tongue
Lick between her legs and try to get her sprung
That ain’t the tip, ah, nah
You stupid muthafuckas, what’s wrong wit’ y’all?
It don’t take all that to get that hoe
If you can’t her, nigga, say, ‘Trick that hoe’
‘Cause when you come up, she’ll be jockin’
On your front door, man, she’ll be knockin’
When you let her in, it’s straight to the covers
That’s the way it goes, believe me, brotha
I’ve been through it all, it don’t mean nothin’
Pussy ain’t shit, make the hoe pay somethin’
It’s Mac Dre, hear what I say
I spit the gift to gab, nigga, every day
Pimpin’, straight pimpin’
I don’t wanna see you simpin’
Listen to my tape, play it all the time
And when it’s over, man, press rewind
‘Cause it’s dope shit, you gotta hear it
And like coke, nigga, you gon’ clear it
And to the top I’m goin’
Bitch, I’m flowin’

And it…and it…and it don’t stop
It’s Mac Dre, y’all
Listen to the things I say, y’all
