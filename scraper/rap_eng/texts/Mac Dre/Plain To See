[Verse 1: Tic]
You know I got issues, first one on the menu
Million dollars make them holler let the game continue
[?] like the day to keep the [?] ballers, Bossalini
Easy, breezy, with the fly bikini
Woodgrain, luxury living and big fame
It's a damn shame how we scrape for change
We made the priority, got hustle from [?] street
Cartel Park, gate services and royalties
Ya heard of me, the beat so [?]
In god we trust, [?] is the Treacherous
Bust out the woofers in your navi
Gold and scratch happy
Make a [?] freak nasty, fly and classy

[Verse 2: PSD]
Armored truck hold up, showed up with mini's
Got away with 90 pounds of twomps, fifties and benji's
But shame on the lame that lost his fucking brain
Caught a half of clip of hollow tips for touching on his thang
And if you're slain you tell 'em Lucifer sent cha
Let 'em load it if it's eye for eye, denture for denture
'Cause you know the lack of jobs made us who and what we are
[?]
Ain't no mystery, history to get busy for some scrilla
Label us capable and say we them niggas
Murk the wittnesses and botch your plan
Have my folks in court to put the red dot on the man

[Pre verse 3]
It's plain to see, you can't change me
'Cause I'm a scrilla getter for life
It's plain to see, you can't change me
'Cause I'm a scrilla getter for life

[Verse 3: Dubee]
I rip shit, relentless, super sav nigga
Off the ave nigga, and the four figure smash nigga
One of the sickest niggas, quickest to lick this nigga
Say I figure y'all, be some punk rap broads
Gay-Z, [?] throws an axe
Artillery and when a nigga get back
We ain't no jaw jacks, zip the bags if you lit
I'm from the Hill, [?] ready to hurt shit, chirp bitch
And get away, HK's and grenades
When I'm shot, check the spot nigga serenade
Never bend the blade, these federals to sharp to play
Ready to get y'all for change, [?]

[Verse 4: Mac Dre]
Call it Cutthoatish, doggish or ruthless
But the truth is we gooses for granny's gooses
Chips, grits, Pringles, Funyuns
And my bitches gonna ho until they feet get bunions
I'm all about my fetty, you got a lick I'm ready
For stolers and Nova's that's stolen, them chevy's
350 supped up, we quick to scoop up
Paper, pull a caper when I'm with my two cuts
Two cups of Becks, two pills of Ex
Rolling in a X and boy I'm selling sex
Married to the game lame, no wife
Scrilla getter nigga, for life

[Outro]
It's plain to see, you can't change me
'Cause I'm a scrilla getter for life
It's plain to see, you can't change me
'Cause I'm a scrilla getter for life
It's plain to see, you can't change me
'Cause I'm a scrilla getter for life
It's plain to see, you can't change me
'Cause I'm a scrilla getter for life
It's plain to see, you can't change me
'Cause I'm a scrilla getter for life
It's plain to see, you can't change me
'Cause I'm a scrilla getter for life
It's plain to see, you can't change me
'Cause I'm a scrilla getter for life
It's plain to see, you can't change me
'Cause I'm a scrilla getter for life
