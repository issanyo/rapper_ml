Awe, yeah
Mac Dre
From the brain
They don’t know nothing about this type of music, mayne
So-so dope
Check it out…

[Verse 1]
1991 can’t leave my house without packing my gun
'cus nowadays things ain't so clean
You either end up dope dealing or being a dope fiend
Too much stress on a young man’s brain
Smoking that dank to deal with the pain
Much love for the brothers in the crew
But who in the crew will be here in ’92?

Every damn day I see more
Brothers getting killed or thrown in a trunk
Dope fiend mothers sellin sex
Welfare mother’s waiting for checks
Pops in the bathroom shooting Hop
Tell me, my brothers, where does it stop?
I got to get a grip, can’t let it phase me
I’m staying strong, 'cus times are getting crazy

[Hook]
Times are getting crazy {crazy, crazy, crazy}
Times are getting crazy
Times are getting crazy
Times are getting crazy
Times are getting crazy {crazy, crazy}
Times are getting crazy!

[Verse 2]
Brothers search hard for that perfect life
5 bedroom home, 2 kids, and a wife
Dog in the back by the swimming pool
Everybody wants to be living cool
But, to have these things you must have hope, mayn
Can’t get wrapped up in the dope game
It ain’t cool, you better stay far
Life is much more than brains and a car

Girls having babies before it’s time
Getting pregnant and don’t have a dime
THINK, baby, don’t be a fool
You better wait until things get cool
Keep a hat on a young man’s jimmy
It’s safe sex, but you don’t hear me
Wake up, you can’t be lazy
'Cus times are getting crazy

Times are getting crazy…
[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Children from the black minority
Locked down in the Youth Authority
Dewitt-Nelson, Washington Ridge
These are places they lock down kids
It ain't right, it wasn’t meant to be
We don’t belong in no penitentiary
You got a talent, you better use it
Pick up a pen and write some music
And if not, boy, play sports
Get the Hoop ball and hit the court
The dope game just ain't cool
You better try and stay in school
'Cus times are getting crazy…

Times are getting crazy
[Hook x3]
