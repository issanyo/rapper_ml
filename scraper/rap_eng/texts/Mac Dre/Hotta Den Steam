(Intro)
Ya Ya ya (Yo, yo, yo)
Let me get this shit started, mayne (get this shit started, mayne!)
If it's gon' be a party, let me get the shit started, mayne (get the party started, mayne!)
Yadadameam? (yadadamean!)

(Verse 1)
Pass the boilermaker, and your toilet paper
I'm shittin' on fools, dope like a quarter caker
Or a acre, not a Celtic or a Laker
I'm a King, find me on Florin with a mouth full of bling
In something clean, doing MY thing
Nigga what you mean, I'm a legend like Kareem
Abdul-Jabbar, I screwed your broad
Snaked ya, 42 faked ya
Oops, fooled ya, boy
Who's ya boy? He's better of dead
Let that cat know he's in over his head
What? You ain't know? I'm mafia nigga
Got a nation of thugs that'll die for ya nigga
Ride for ya nigga, But, I need no mans
Wanna tango? Come on, nigga, we gon' dance
I'll do the Thizzle Wiggle, right on your face
Then throw you in the trunk with the bump and the base

(Hook 1 (by PSD))
Yadidamean, I'm Hotta Den Steam
Sharp as a crease, nigga, follow my teach
Bother me not, nigga, potna is mean
A prophet-like street hustla, nigga
Cutthoat heat tucka
Yadidamean, I'm Hotta Den Steam
Sharp as a crease, nigga, follow my teach
Bother me not, nigga, potna is mean
A prophet-like street hustla, nigga
Cutthoat heat tucka

(Verse 2)
I'm prideful, pack a rifle, like Daniel Boone
Romper Room tycoon, best things since cartoons
And my platoon'll eat a nigga like shrooms
Goons, muggin' n' thuggin' from July to June
A gorilla do the baboon all in a womb
Find me flossin' on flyers that say "Coming Soon"
I 'coon, nocturnal, love the moon
But we can meet in the middle of the street at high noon
And my beat goes boom, to concern may it whom
On this mic, I'll eat ya, no forks, knives or spoons
I sport Nike shoes, strike Gucci and Louie
From the Crest, on the best, light, sticky and gooey
Never fuck with the Chewy, but when I kick it with Dubee
We pop several Thizzes, ooh we get stuey
Shoo buh dee doo wop, doo buh dee doo
Mirror, mirror on the wall, tell me who be the fool?

(Hook 2 (by PSD))
Yadidamean, I'm Hotta Den Steam
Sharp as a crease, nigga, follow my teach
Bother me not, nigga, potna is mean
A prophet-like street hustla, nigga
Cutthoat heat tucka
Yadidamean, I'm Hotta Den Steam
Sharp as a crease, nigga, follow my teach
Bother me not, nigga, potna is mean
A prophet-like street hustla, nigga
Cutthoat heat tucka

(Verse 3)
The Feds watch me, like I'm a fuckin' Hitachi
But I got Lessons And Suggestions, like The RBL Posse
Protected by God, see, Them devils can't hurt me
And them haters get ate just like Thanksgiving Turkey
I'm a warrior, when I, come out and play
I do it like we do it, nigga, out in The Bay
Sideshow after every show, yokin' in a Chevy, ho
Seven seven Box, or a Glasshouse seven fo'
You never no, yo, I keep 'em guessin'
Strapped with a fat .40 Cal Smith & Wesson
For my protection, but nobody see it
'Til it's funk, when it's funk, punk I 3D it
Live N' Direct, I ride for respect
And I got prison tactics, catch a knife to the neck
Catch me in a 2 seater on Van Ness
Ridin' with my 2 heaters, who wan' come test?

(Hook 3 (by PSD))
Yadidamean, I'm Hotta Den Steam
Sharp as a crease, nigga, follow my teach
Bother me not, nigga, potna is mean
A prophet-like street hustla, nigga
Cutthoat heat tucka
Yadidamean, I'm Hotta Den Steam
Sharp as a crease, nigga, follow my teach
Bother me not, nigga, potna is mean
A prophet-like street hustla, nigga
Cutthoat heat tucka

Yaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!
