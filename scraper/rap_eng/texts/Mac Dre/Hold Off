[Verse 1: Mac Dre]
Now I came here for something hyphy to happen
Is this Christmas? Because everybody's rapping
There's too much yapping, running off at the jaw
When your beats ain't slapping and your rhymes ain't raw
Super bunkola like a bag of stress
You need to sell yola, give the mic a rest
Nigga you ain't fresh, you weak
You sound like a broad and you rap off beat
Nigga back off me, tryna get signed up
You silly rabbit, you need a good wind up
Line up with the rest of the chumps
Cut the crap, come back with some slumps
Ship get sunk, kerplunk
Perp start macking, stop acting drunk
Get low, punk, get on
Who told you, you can rap? Hold on

[Hook: Miami the Most]
Hold off
Because you soft
My ninjas get off
Hold off
Because y'all soft
My ninjas get off (Hold on)
Hold off
Because y'all soft
My ninjas get off
Hold off
Because y'all soft

Double, get off

[Verse 2: Richie Rich]
The shit that you're spittin' ain't really hittin'
You could bail out, have you ever thought to quitting?
All these niggas on these compilations
Everybody rapping all across the nation
He used to be a janitor, now he flow
My nigga played pro ball, now he flow
My nigga dropped out of school, now he flow
But that bullshit he rippin' ain't banging at all
Now 415 was gangster rap
Half Thang was gangster rap
Seasoned Veteran was gangster rap
Plus The Game was gangster rap
So me and Mac Dre come to check The Bay
Punk, it ain't what you do but what you say
Sixteen bars, can you hold your weight?
I stole "Five on It" and only blew off eight
Nigga, what? Fuck with that

[Hook: Miami the Most]
Hold off
Because you soft
My ninjas get off
Hold off
Because y'all soft
My ninjas get off (Hold on)
Hold off
Because y'all soft
My ninjas get off
Hold off
Because y'all soft
We never stop

[Verse 3: Mac Dre]
Hold off, MC Never Heard
And you rap like you on crack and a squirter
Don't deserve a, shot or a chance
When you rap, the people don't dance
You's a Gong Show king, you unknown comic
You make the mic smell like vomit
Quit it, will you? (Will ya?)
You're your only fan, they just don't feel you
Mildew, rotten, vanished, forgotten
What the fuck is going on?
Who told you you could rap? Hold on

[Hook 2X: Miami the Most]
Hold off
Because you soft
My ninjas get off
Hold off
Because y'all soft
My ninjas get off (Hold on)
Hold off
Because y'all soft
My ninjas get off
Hold off
Because y'all soft
We never stop
