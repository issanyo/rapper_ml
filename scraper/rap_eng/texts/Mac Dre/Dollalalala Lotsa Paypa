[Verse 1: Mac Dre]

Preppy pimp, Crestside rider
Work 150's and top siders
Oops upside her, head if she comes short
Bread, I'm a gunfolk, yea I'm a cut throat
Backwood burner
Mack and murder
I pack the squirter, when I blap the squirter
Fools gon' fall like tall timber
Killing off the whole gang, all members
Cum in her, never magnum
She better have them or I'm never stabbin'
Whatever happened to the girl from the south
Suck a dick so good they called her pussy mouth
Pussy's foul but the heads A-plus
If I put her in heels and a little make up
And hit Vegas, will she make us

[Hook]
Dollalalala Lots Of Paper(x3)
Put your heels on the strip see what you make us
Dollalalala lots of paper(x3)
Put your heels on the strip see what you make us
Dollalalala lots of paper

[Verse 2: KC Bobcat]
I need a beat baby
What you need to do is turn
She a cheap paper
I show you how to get it
How to work them heels maybe
If you get up and you get out
Turn corners, stick to it, dont let up
Your toes hit the strip, bring drip, bring chedder
Ching ching, get money get dough what else can I tell you?
Bob man, he anglin, c-a-t will sell you
Thick game that I stole from a older uncle
Its nephew ben its your nephew bubble
But dont get me I'm like because nephew trouble
If she knew better she'll do better
Like my uncle miami says "her mom won't let her"
I'mma be a west player with style forever
Will Bobcat quit? naw I want chedder
Make a punk rock hit the block give me a burger

Dollalalala lots of paper (x3)
With ya heels on a strip scene would ya make us?
Dollalalala lots of paper (x3)

[Verse 3: Sauce]

When my money gets low I don't kick in the door
I just pick up a ho and make her get with the flow
Give her the script that I want her to play
And bout a day or two, fuck the dick game
Now she wants to pay her dues
Show her what these players do, down in Vegas
Air force nikes, we dont need no gators
500 benz and we're riding scrapers
And any old hater catch shock from the blazer
Dollalalala lots of paper, lots of cake to
Open up shop, get a (?? Unclear)
You gots to pay us, so I'm (also unclear)
So if I dont see you working, and your splurging, then its hurting
I gotta be perking when im on the strip
Make a bitch give dome and stay on the trick
And im known to dip, from frisco to vegas
Dollalalala lots of paper

Dollalalala lots of paper (x3)
Put your heels on the strip see what you make us
Dollalalala lots of paper (x3)
Put your heels on the strip see what you make us
Dollalalala lots of paper
