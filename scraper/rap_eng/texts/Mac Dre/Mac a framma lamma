[Mac Mall talking]
You crash-helmet wearin' heffer
You turf-dirt tramp
[Mac Mall talking]
You crash-helmet wearin' heffer
You turf-dirt tramp
You Sack-chasin ass cunt
Bathwaterless bitch

[Mac Mall]
Whats up with it ho, tell me whats it all about?
Seems you always talkin' shit when this pimp dick not in yo mouth
And then you wonder why a nigga quick to dig yo helmet
And slap yo ass so hard when usually I'm smooth as velvet
See trick I'm from the bay and man we make them broads obey
And if you don't then you gon sport up on sling and neck brace
Word to OJ and my nigga Ike Turner
If that ho don't know her role them ima learn her (learn her?)
Sessed out I turned her, she get hella emotional
But don't let the square be his feelins if that ass beat down
And even now I get the femenists sayin'
"a real man would never put his hands on a woman"
But a punk-bitch ain't no lady
They shifty and shady
Crooked connivin' 51/50 crazy
But I'm quick to introduce her to the mac-prozac
Choke-holds and back hand slaps
Now bitch dig that!

[Chorus x2: Mac Mall
Mac-a-fram-a-lama punk ho toe-tagga
Savage mainy-manish plus a money hungry bastard
Big face stacker and a mouth piece master
Never chase that bitch id rather let you suckas catch her

[Mac Dre]
Now to understand a mac-a-fram-a-lama
You must first know the lingo
Comprehend the grammar
Feel me when I flow, learn what I'm lacin'
Mac, I master the art of communication
365 days a year
I'm in the bitch year
Sayin' what she wanna hear
Tryin' to get things clear
If they ain't clear
And if she stay here
She's runnin like a reindeer
No playin' here, it's mackin' fo real
Packin' a steal, stackin' the scrill
So if you happen to feel kinda pimperistic
You got the furly ghost in ya
You feelin' my linguistics
Don't get it twisted
Lets keep this on the up and up
Pimp the Blood up out her if she out there fuckin' up
It's time to toughin up and do this cutt-thoatish
Them Mac-a-fram-a-lama niggas is the coldest!

[Chorus x2]
[Mac Mall]
Oops upside yo head
Keep poppin' off at the grill and imma beat you like a egg
See your brother's a punk and your daddy's a old man
They get in my business and ima send 'em back payin'
You know what I'm sayin'
No ho I ain't no gentleman
Im a cut-throat nigga from that that Crest side clan
Won't tell you check yourself cause I got it
A tested method to get a bitch back in pocket
See one of my my breezys start to bumpin' them gums
A mac black out, and get to goin' on one
And I don't give a fuck let the police come
Lets split this bitch wig because she much too dumb
Said I don't give a fuck let the police come
Let this bitch wig because she much too dumb
We keepin' it mackin' on the real where I'm from
A nothing-ass slut talk shit she gets stomped, stomped

[Chorus x2]
