[Intro: Mac Dre]
Aww no (yea)
Here we go again
Once mo gin (here we go again)
Back in Sebastopol, (Sebastopol) with my hash friend, (My hash friend)
Smoov-E, (Smoov-E) understand me?
Smoov-muthafuckin-E
And me M-D
From the V

[Verse 1: Mac Dre]
I come from a place where the dope fiends base
And it's hard to keep the rollers out your face
Keep a strap on your lap in the back in the sack
And a fat Zapco for the bass
X, sex, latex
Leather coats by Avirex
Icy fools in Nike shoes
We play to win, don't like to lose
A lotta player cats in Cal Bear hats
Lookin' for some chassis on the loose
Gold-diggin bitches tryin ta get you for ya riches
Now tell me ain't that the truth
Tennis shoe pimpin, ain't no simpin, nigga try to get it hella quick
We rhyme, grind, all the time, sometimes might pull a lick
Hella hoggish, slightly doggish
September 'til the end of August
It's me MD in the place to be
Back with my cutthoat Smoov-E

"When I'm weedless
I'm a fiend and I need this"

[Hook 2X: Mac Dre & Smoov-E]
We smokes (we smokes) our grass (our grass)
And sometimes it's laced with hash (not laced with hash)
They shakes (they shakes) they ass (they ass)
And sometimes we take they cash (we take they cash)

[Interlude: Smoov-E]
I want you to take me to yo house (yo house)
Put some Isotoners on my feet (my feet)
Pay for the wheels on my wagon (my wagon)
You know
Pick up the tab on the pants I’m sagging (I’m sagging)
Cause that’s what you need to do (that’s what you need to do)
Like that girl (like that)
That’s what you need to do

[Verse 2: Smoov-E]
You by yourself, didn't bring sacs
Can't hang with E and all the Macs
With no head and shoulder
You think your getting cold but boy it gets colder
Boulder bash your expectations
Hot with heat with a kind of relations
You live a dream but you ain't got heem
Tell me you a baller but you ain't got a team
Can't break a bitch, no skill
Ho better bring me my pills
You can't play me with ya old Mercedes
Gotta give something for the grown man gravy
Hazy baby come with cabbage
Three new broads is a weekly average
A young mac know the dick to the purse
Hit it from the back
Climbing in reverse
She had high socks and skirt like a nurse
She wasn't that fine but it sure gets worse
Night start slow with a quick finish
Hash to the head with an Olde English
Wiggle what ya momma gave ya
Don't mind my behavior
Wiggle what ya poppa gave ya
Don't mind my misbehavior

[Hook 2X: Mac Dre & Smoov-E]
We smokes (we smokes) our grass (our grass)
And sometimes it's laced with hash (not laced with hash)
They shakes (they shakes) they ass (they ass)
And sometimes we take they cash (we take they cash)

[Outro: Smoov-E]
Her name was Rhonda, she liked marijuana
And let me hit in the back of her Honda
That Afghani, hash come in handy
With a hat to the side, big D in the ride, talk you out yo' panties
Her name was Rhonda, she liked ganja
And let me hit in the back of her Honda
That Afghani, hash come in handy
With a hat to the side, big D in the ride, talk you out yo' panties
