That's some bull ass shit, When yo home get kiked out th book
That's some bull ass shit, Lookin' in yo hom for yo chips and yo cushion
That's some bull ass shit, And yo hut get whipped
That's some bull ass shit, And yo 30 plus get took
That's some bull ass shit, When you on high risk parole
That's some bull ass shit, You got to do what you told
That's some bull ass shit, Talkin' about some pot in my pee
That's some bull ass shit, Well nigga that shit nadda to me

That's some bull ass shit, I'm still a popin' collar G
That's some bull ass shit, Lil' Mama look thick in them jeans
That's some bull ass shit, Only 16
That's some bull ass shit, If it ain't the Cutthoat Committee
That's some bull ass shit, If you don't tote it with me
