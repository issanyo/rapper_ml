(Speaking)
Yeah
Bring it on, dedicated to the niggas that thought I lost it
No falloffish (stayin alive)
Yeah, keep this thing going stayin alive you beezy
Mac D.R.E, up in this bitch Yeah
Im out back mothafucka
Im out back with the dawgs

(Chorus)
You never met a nigga like me
The M to the D
From the C.C.C
Im a G
I run with niggas that jack for fun
And I'll never leave the house without packing my gun
(whole thing X2)

(Verse 1)
I'm seeing studio gangstas get lost in the fame
You paper sack niggas keep crossing the game
You think life ain't made 'em but a gang of bitches
You can't stop talking if you hang with snitches
You'se a suckelle nigga
Quit dropping the salt
If you pimpin ain't strong it's not my fault
At every event
I see your face
With my name in your mouth you must love the taste
Nigga, what the deal
Is you for real
Playing ho games and get your cap peeled
Now hear mack spill straight from the heart
I buy fits with the chips that I take from marks
Cause a major part
Of this game is muscle
Us sawavege get cabbage respect the hustle
When I'm wide around the mouth(wide around the mouth)
I pull a pistol out (pull a pistol out)
Boy I needed big (boy I needed big)
Don't make me split yo wig (dont make me split yo wig)
Nigga, Mac D.R.E, you never met a nigga like me

(Chorus)
You never met a nigga like me
The M to the D
From the C.C.C
Im a G
I run with niggas that jack for fun
And I'll never leave the house without packing my gun
(whole thing X2)

(Verse 2)
Head Honcho
But you can call me Sancho
Creepin with yo bitch got my dick on her tonsils
I'm at the crib with your bitch in the door
Smokin crip feeding goldfish to my shark
The kind of nigga that you haters hate the most
Quick to pull the trigger when a nigga play me close
West Coast Cuthoat Gorilla
It gets no realer I Gets more scrilla (ching ching)
Yo nigga big dick daddy
I get paid from a big thick patty and matty
I bubble I represent the double R
In my car gon' give the rollers trouble
On a high speed chase on the freeway
Don't think the police want to see Dre
Im bonafide certified
And gon' be still jackin when I'm 35

(Chorus)
You never met a nigga like me
The M to the D
From the C.C.C
Im a G
I run with niggas that jack for fun
And I'll never leave the house without packing my gun
(whole thing X2)

(Verse 3)
All must die and some die young
That's why I never leave the house without packing my gun
My selection for protection desert eagle
I'm down and dirty
Never legal
I Know some people that will get you for your jewels
Them cuthoat fools nigga
You know the rules
Caught slippin
Give it up
You think i'm trippin I could give a fuck
Romp renegade smokin dank in in the shade
Drinkin Yukon Jack and lemonade blade
What the fuck you heard
Your pimpin's to the curve
You actin like a nerd
Get your life straight
Pull your self together
If your bitch want to ho up
Nigga let her
Is nothing like the feeling of a pimp with money
You better recognize you big dummy

(Chorus)
You never met a nigga like me
The M to the D
From the C.C.C
Im a G
I run with niggas that jack for fun
And I'll never leave the house without packing my gun
(whole thing X4)
