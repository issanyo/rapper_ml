[Verse 1: PSD]
I love the paper, I'm a thug by nature
I take the mug of a hater, that's just blood on my gators
Who I'm is? Tha Drivah, bitch
On a plane, with a half thang inside the bitch
I'm looking hella inconspicuous, nonchalant
With a whole zip of piff in my dun dun dun
You can't owe, but I got it, what you need and want?
Six five for the nina, I got none to front
Good nigga, Cutthoat, 3C hood nigga
Money up on the wood (yes), it's all good
I represent if I should for MD and Sug (my nigga's)
Players do what they want haters do what they could
Paper when niggas flaunt, vapors take over hoods
Ho's will hollar "Ooh" Turf niggas will "Uhh"
For reals, we tryna live, that's how serious it is
No deals, so fuck what judge and what jury it is
I'm him

[Hook]
They say a hustler will never get to live as long
They say a player when he older he'll be alone
Yeah I'm in, let's do this shit, to me it's nothing
Nothing, it's nothing man
I make a dollar out a nickel and a dime of cron
Running game on these bitches to confine they mind
Say she in love, but girl love to me, it's nothing

[Verse 2: Dubee]
We into this pimpin'
Sending them women hoeing for a percentage
You wanna get raw?
I make them drop they jaw, what you thought?
Bet you bought this tape, to tighten up your screws
Replace your boots and shoes
Leave a sucky ho stuck and confused
When I bruise the beat, you will see
A Cutthoat nigga, [?]
Super duper nigga on turf, [?] yoke in a glass house
I was thizzed out, stopped to push your bitch out
'Cause she so square she couldn't figure this out
You're out bitch, cut, ho we ain't no punks
Take a nigga's baddest bitch turn her into Turf cunt
Put a blunt up in it and she will puff it
Put a hundred up in it, let you run up in it
Just don't put your gun up in it
I release pimp shit, unbelievable
Breathing on cheddar, plus you feign for dough
No sweaters, we tote Beretta's and headers is what we sending
Bitches yelling ain't shit, niya, look at what I tell 'em

[Hook]
They say a hustler will never get to live as long
They say a player when he older he'll be alone
Yeah I'm in, let's do this shit, to me it's nothing
Nothing, it's nothing man
I make a dollar out a nickel and a dime of cron
Running game on these bitches to confine they mind
Say she in love, but girl love to me, it's nothing

[Verse 3: Mac Dre]
Now quench your thirst with a sip from this pimpin' boy
I go bad on bitches like Orenthal Simpson
Sour, filthy call me nasty
All in her guts while I'm slapping her ass cheeks
Ask me no questions, I'll tell you no lies
She gets no affection whenever she cries
Nigga ride or die, H-O-E (Hoe up)
If they know me, they owe me
Chevy driver everynight, I get it from the womb
Check a sucker motherfucker, gone off shrooms
Ripped off Hennessy and there's finna be
Bodies found in the near vicinity
My enemies better stay home
'Cause I'm spraying up bodies like spray on cologne
Oh, who, could it be? The Crestside Cutthoat me MD
