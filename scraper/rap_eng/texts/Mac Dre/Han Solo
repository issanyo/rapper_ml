[Intro: Mac Dre]
Right now, I'm ratchet baby
Right now, ratchet baby
Right now, ratchet baby
Turn these motherfucking lights off (turn these lights off)
Turn this motherfucking phone off (turn the phone off)
Turn this pager off (turn this pager off)
Turn my bitch off (turn the bitch off)
Turn the whole world off

[Verse 1: Mac Dre]
I'm after [?]
After a long weekend
Phone keep ringing, pager keep beeping
Can't get no sleep and, beezy in my ear
Some old bullshit I ain't trying to hear
Drink some Drano, get off me bitch
'Fore I slap the spit off your motherfucking lips
It's time to dip, put on my kicks
Today I'm finna kick it with Andre Hicks
Leave my phone at home, turn my pager off
Might miss knocks but I'll take a loss
'Cause I've had it up to here
My poor gear, need a vacation, leave six times a year
Every other month I do a Houdini
Get to pulling on a eight and a dirty martini
Drink so damn much it might make me hurl
Give a fuck, I'm finna shake the world

[Hook: Syko]
I'm finna shake the world
I ain't fucking with y'all
Too many Jakes, snakes and fakes
Perpetrators and frauds
And nigga today can't nobody ride
I'm Han Solo, no autographs or photos
Behind tint blowing dolo
Finna shake the world
I ain't fucking with y'all
Too many Jakes, snakes and fakes
Perpetrators and frauds
And nigga today can't nobody ride
I'm Han Solo, no autographs or photos
Behind tint blowing dolo

[Verse 2: Mac Dre]
It's going down in my town
But that ain't where I'm at yo
I'm in the Rover by myself, fucking with a satin ho
Had a quail of the real, now I'm down to an eighth
Go to the honeycomb hideout, get a G out the safe
Hop back in the range do a little touring
Hit the outlets, polo by Ralph Lauren
Tommy [?] Nautica, Nikes
I'm a preppy pimp, they don't dress like me
In the zone, blown, in outer space
A fifth to the neck, an eight to the face
Just going dolo, you know solo
My ho's keep paging but they gon' have to hold on
I need a time out, an intermission
My cutty's on a mission, my bitch keep trippin'
Punk rock beezy trying to fuck  with Furl
I don't cur, today I'm trying to shake the world

[Hook: Syko]
I'm finna shake the world
I ain't fucking with y'all
Too many Jakes, snakes and fakes
Perpetrators and frauds
And nigga today can't nobody ride
I'm Han Solo, no autographs or photos
Behind tint blowing dolo
Finna shake the world
I ain't fucking with y'all
Too many Jakes, snakes and fakes
Perpetrators and frauds
And nigga today can't nobody ride
I'm Han Solo, no autographs or photos
Behind tint blowing dolo
