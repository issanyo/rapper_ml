It all started off with the doctor telling my momma push
On July 5th 1-9-7-0 Mac Dre hopped out that puss
I've been soaking game since Rock 'Em Sock 'Em and Hot Wheels
Not never the chance to pass me I keep 'em jocking, I got skills
And when I'm on the mic, styles I got so many
Drink privilege Hennessy when I ain't fuckin' with RÃ©my
M-A-C D-R-E, that's me
Like 'em freaky like Janet not Jackson but jack me, whee!
To all my niggas in Atlanta to Alabama
Rodreego blowin' only homie, don't fuck with bammer
I planned to have a ticket and kick it in the Bahamas
Watch your hutch and don't trust your baby mama
Cause I will get your scrill when I kill all in them guts
Don't give a fuck when you give a crippled crab a crutch
But they respect it if not they get rejected
I'm M-D the MC that's not to be corrected

[Hook 2x]
Ichi, ni, san, shee. Uno, dos, cuatro
I'm sicker than ten J-cats that be gone off that vato
Most sexual intellectual with at least six figures before the decimal
Warm, hot, and respectable but I'm nothing correctable

I fucks with high rollers, shake highway patrollers
Quick to pop the trunk but will come from the shoulders
Got the cuddie named Dubee, he spit more raps than loogies
And when he hand it to me I'm funky like him to me
"Baby do me!" is all them hutches holler
I was breakin' bitches when phantom tops was on granadas
More game than keno, down to trips to Reno
Sippin' cappuccino with Natalia Shapino
C-note stacka' pack a P-89
Love group sex take 'em three at a time
And boy I be out of line when I'm full that Tanqueray
Quick to grab the chopper, cock her, aim, and spray
Urban guerrilla warfare extraordinare
You know a bout my macking but boy I'm more than a player
Resurrected double R elected
Haters get ejected I'm nothing to be corrected

[Hook 2x]

Pistol packin' player, gangsta mac for real
About my scrill got to pay my bills
Boy I'm in it to win it if you weak and timid
Better watch how you spend it I'll take yours like timmy
Busting out like tities in a bra that's too small
Grew up off Too Short stackin' scrill too tall
Mac Drizzay, all damn dizzay
I keep hoes dizzay in a one time busy
Been rappin' before they called Mac Mall Brehmis
Rompin' peace Mike Robinson, son of Dennis
I'm in this too deep like Tim, Jim, and Johnny
Much love for my cuddies Jay, Ray, and Ronny
Raping pockets I get mine however it come
Boy I get dumb about my income
Mac furley up early sippin' X-O
Nothing correctable; nigga you know

[Hook 2x]
