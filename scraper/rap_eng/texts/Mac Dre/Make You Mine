[Woman]
Something about what you've done to me, baby, I wanna make you mine
You really bring out the best in me, baby, can I make you mine

[Verse 1]
I went bad on a bitch, but I don't love her
She want an apology but I ain't Ruben Studdard
I'm buttered, so she jock me style
She buttered, but she not me style
She don't got it and she ain't trying to have it
Man, I'm lavish and got expensive habits
If I stab it, what can she offer?
Naw sir, Dreezy ain't gon' toss her
And she thick too, but I don't want her yokes
I want all her Federal Reserve notes
I'm better with no hoes over a broke one
I'll take the ugliest bitch in Oakland
And come through yolkin' Chucky Cheesed up
You broke bitches got me fucked up
I'm a rich nigga, I got lawyers
You broke, I can't do nothin' but ignore ya

[Hook 2x]
Something about what you've done to me baby I wanna make you mine
You really bring out the best in me baby can I make you mine

[Verse 2]
This crazy motherfucker wanna be my chick
Always trying to fuck and suck my dick
It won't happen, you ain't got no mail
You ain't got a snowball's chance in hell
I'm from Vallejo where most niggas is pimps
We eat butterfly tiger prawns not scrimps
On the other side of the fence, what's crackin'?
Did you detect some slackin' in my mackin'?
You can't try it unless you buy it
Broke bitch got my dick on a diet
Can't fuck on her and no I don't want her
This is O.J. Simpson pimpin' not Homer

[Hook 2x]
Something about what you've done to me, baby, I wanna make you mine
You really bring out the best in me, baby, can I make you mine

[Verse 3]
She trying to make me hers but I can't be hers
Unless I'm goosing her for chips and I'm taking hers
Trying to live so fat I gotta watch calories
It's all about a salary, and that's reality
I'm a book you shouldn't judge by its cover, hoe
I been getting dough since Young Black Brotha, hoe
I'm a brother that can make things happen
Jacking, acting, macking, rapping
Let's get it crackin', get the slacking out
Every day I blow a half an ounce
I like to smash and bounce in all new whips
What can we do if you ain't got a few chips?
Take a few sips of this game I poured
It's money in the streets and it can't be ignored
It's money in the streets and it can't be ignored

[Hook 2x]
Something about what you've done to me, baby, I wanna make you mine
You really bring out the best in me, baby, can I make you mine
