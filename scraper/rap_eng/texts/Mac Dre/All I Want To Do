[Verse 1: Mac Dre]
I'm into parties that don't end at four
Bitches that keep lingerie in their drawer
Back in '84 I swore
To peel straight dimes, no more twos or fours
Not looking for "My Cherie Amour"
I'm a mack, I pimp whores, got CD's in stores
I'm hardcore like the almighty Thor
Campaign with this game man, like Al Gore
Drink Mickey's not Coors, no sticky pot wars
Got wounds and sores, boy I been through wars
I want to party until I fall to the floor
Get drunk, pass out, then snore
Mrs. bartender come pour me some more
What no more? Fuck you, up yours!
I'm into whores that wear Christian Dior
No pimples or clogged up pores
I don't bark, I roar, catch me on tour
In a velour, ho's screaming for more
Fuck it, you want me to come with some more whores?
Or cutthroat up and take this shit outdoors?

[Hook: Mac Dre]
All I ever want to do is party
Catch me at the club trying to holler at somebody
I'm rolling with the bumps in the trunk
Trying to have fun 'cause you only live once
All I ever want to do is party
Catch me at the club trying to holler at somebody
I'm rolling with the bumps in the trunk
Trying to have fun 'cause you only live once

[Verse 2: Mac Dre]
See them other niggas be mean mugging
Catch me MD on the scene bugging
Hanging out the hole in my groove
Sun shining off the diamonds on my tooth
Man, I'll tell you the truth
Rapping to you is like selling you some food
I'm dope, like a pound or a key
Look what they done found in the V
MD, Ew-we, rolling like Bart or a SUV
My things got spin wheels that spin like pinwheels
Might be getting fucked with the hutch she in heels
Play infield, outfield and pitcher
I'm an all around player, nigga I'll hit ya
Get with ya? I'd rather have fun
'Cause it's no fun, being on the run
And that's what I'm finna be, get from in front of me
And quit acting like a thug you fucking wannabe
Pop a pill and wake up nigga, you'll never be like us

[Hook: Mac Dre]
All I ever want to do is party
Catch me at the club trying to holler at somebody
I'm rolling with the bumps in the trunk
Trying to have fun 'cause you only live once
All I ever want to do is party
Catch me at the club trying to holler at somebody
I'm rolling with the bumps in the trunk
Trying to have fun 'cause you only live once

[Verse 3: Mac Dre]
"Funky Cold Medina" have you seen her?
She be with Tina, drive a green beamer
I be seeing her at every function
I'm trying to get her to uh, suck something
Put something in that jaw
I'm not interested in her friend at all
Kinda slim and tall, I need 'em short and thick
Not some dumb unfortunate
I need it big, I mean bigger
Not that big, bitch watch your figure

[Hook: Mac Dre]
All I ever want to do is party
Catch me at the club trying to holler at somebody
I'm rolling with the bumps in the trunk
Trying to have fun 'cause you only live once
All I ever want to do is party
Catch me at the club trying to holler at somebody
I'm rolling with the bumps in the trunk
Trying to have fun 'cause you only live once
