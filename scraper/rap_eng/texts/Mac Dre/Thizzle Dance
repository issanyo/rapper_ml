[Intro]
Hello everybody...(Hi)..
I'd like to introduce you to the Thizzle Dance...(Thizzle Dance?)
Thizzle Dance I said..
Can you do the Thizzle Dance?

[Verse 1: Mac Dre]
First, I do like this
Put a look on my face like I smelled some piss
Bounce to the beat till it start to hurt
Then I dust all the smirk off me shirt
Dip to the ground as I catch the bass
Then I wipe all the sweat off me face
Hop back up then I start to slide
Popping my collar as I glide
Then I break the thang down and do The Bird
Dust myself off like I just stole third
Come on everybody now's the chance
Fuck the Harlem Shake, this the Thizzle Dance!

[Hook]
Dance, Thizz Dance
Thizz Dance, Thizz Dance
Can you do the Thizzle Dance?
Dance, Thizz Dance
Thizz Dance, Thizz Dance
Can you do the Thizzle Dance?

[Verse 2: Chuck Beez]
First of all I hope you got you a juice
A Thizzle because it's time to pop you a few
Then you gas, brake, start to dip
Bounce with the car as it start to shit
Open up the car doze the whole damn car low
Hop out and follow, while you let the car roll
Ghostride the whip while you ride the strip
Here's your chance to do your dance on the side of it
While you at it the passenger and driver switch
Then hurry up and jump back inside your shit
Hanging out the rooftop
Do not get ooh-aahed by them fool cops that tryna have you got
Other than that you and your boys 'coon big
You wanna learn 'coon stay tuned to Thizz
Hoochie-mama freaks, get yo man
And show them niggas how to do the Thizzle Dance

[Hook]
Dance, Thizz Dance
Thizz Dance, Thizz Dance
Can you do the Thizzle Dance?
Dance, Thizz Dance
Thizz Dance, Thizz Dance
Can you do the Thizzle Dance?

[Bridge]
Ahh, what, Thizz... ahh Thizz what..
Ahh, what, Thizz... ahh Thizz (what)..

[Verse 3: Mac Dre]
When I do it they say I'm killin it
The look on my face mean I'm feelin it
Just like the niggas that I'm chillin wit it
You can't do the thizz unless your pillin it
This is the last verse then I'm sealin it
After this niggas gon be stealin it
This is hip hop with no Johnny Gill-in-it
No New Edition or Prince when I'm spillin it
I'm 12 years strong and I'm still in it
Now I'm slugged up
And diamond grillin it
I don't care who I'm in the building with
I do the dance with Nancy Von Chillinwich

[Hook]
Dance, Thizz Dance
Thizz Dance, Thizz Dance
Can you do the Thizzle Dance?
Dance, Thizz Dance
Thizz Dance, Thizz Dance
Can you do the Thizzle Dance?
