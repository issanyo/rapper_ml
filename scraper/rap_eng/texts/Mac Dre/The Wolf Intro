[Verse: Dubee]
I'm super hyph-el
Chop it up with the rifle
Locked on the block with dime cells
Busting these niggas that might tell
Nigga my shells hit your mind cell
Cutthoat nigga make a strap go blap
And then it fade to black
Nigga that's just how we act
I'm super sav'd out
Turftop nigga, yoking a glass house
Fuck with me, you're ass out
Don't call 'til he pass out and smash out
Bitch my niggas be quick to curt and skurt all in the name of dough
Now what you in it fo? I'll have you know
Saw boss, with the skrizzle with the saw
'Til it's reemy, rock reezy, four five beezy's tan it off
They say I'm off the hook, it's looking
Cook a nigga 'cause I'm crooked
If I spot it then I took it
If I rock it then I juk it
Man, it's the green feind
That's what we all about
Nigga been in it for some figures
Snatchin' bitches turn 'em out
I'm on the roller, burn 'em out
Is we soldiers? Ain't no doubt
We move the cola, blow the doja
See we all thugged out
