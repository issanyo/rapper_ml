[Intro]
Yeah, what’s up? This one love, this playa to playa
This Mac Dre and Mac Mall
Finna overtake all y’all

[Chorus 2X: Coolio Da’Unda’Dog]
Playa to playa y’all gotta put this shit down
And make them haters sit down
And bitches kick down, y’all niggas get down
And represent what’s been lackin’, playas
It’s the Crest, the combination of two mackin’ playas

[Verse 1: Mac Mall]
I be that Five-hundred-thirty-five percent
Niggas sessed out every time I rhyme
Backwood twister, it’s Strictly SES on mine
Takin’ my pictures with saucy Caddies in a line
Fuck the world, nigga, I’m gonna spend this good green
On some rope and fully things
Spittin’ throwaway O’s and pipe dreams
Got a crew full of playas and they all like me
So don’t speak to my 5 if a choppa in reach
I’m representin’ young titans, soldiers, playas feel shit I’m writin’
We flow straight dope and well you’re just another client
So kick in before you get your door kicked in
Crestsiders, boy, we at it again
All up in your shit, tellin’ muthafuckers ‘strip’
Cuddie, oh, they didn’t know this a muthafuckin’ lick
So you can fuck with the mob or don’t fuck around at all
Some wise words from young Mac ass Mall

[Chorus]

[Verse 2: Mac Dre]
Hand me the rap tapes, what a Mac made for them suckas to see
That all them late ass niggas really can’t fuck with me, see
I’m M.D., the, V-Town governor
A title well-earned because I be keepin’ ‘em lovin’ a
Candy-coated thing that be sweeter than Reese’s
See, niggas like me is endangered species
How many niggas you know that can flow and keep it really real?
Be on that hoe, and when she owe, boy, I’mma spill
That uncut and untuck po pimpin’ ass game
But I won’t buck and won’t touch ‘til I’m up in a Range
See, I’m lovin’ livin’ lavish, cuddie, so when I ain’t splurgin’
I’m goosin’ up the cabbage in her mind like a brain surgeon
I ain’t hurtin’, you know I’m stackin’ them dollars
Comin’ fresh out the pen strikin’ brand new Impalas
Givin’ it up to my folks and them know, boy, the Country Club
Givin’ up the dope so they can soak off this funky dub

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Mac Mall]
See, I’m a, half hog, other half cold Crest dog
Saucy pit, super hard on a bitch
I switch hoe tricks like Nikes and Guess fits
Baby pop that lip soon to see the payment
You might catch me bent, dunkin’ broads like Kemp
We be smokin’ roper, she be suckin’ Mall’s dick
We be ridin’ Caddy, know that hoe notch quick
When we hit the Carquinez, baby, drink that shit
If I’m too hoggish for y’all, please excuse my penmanship
But I’m from that Country Club where we mob and pull licks
Muthafuckas can’t see Mall, I’m jumpin’ for that gang green, y’all
I’m a creeper, tie you up in your drawers

[Chorus]

[Verse 4: Mac Dre]
When I step to the mic, suckas close they eyes
‘Cause they ain’t tryna see me expose the lies
I see niggas frontin’ and I step to ‘em
‘Cause I’m true to the game, mayne, I gotta do ‘em
That fake shit that they spit is play shit and gay shit
And Dre spit is they shit, you never hear me say shit
That’s ruthless or truthless, that punk shit is useless
I spill the real with skill, niggas can’t juke this
I shoots this, and when I demonstrate
I don’t perpetrate, duplicate or imitate
Raps I originate, saps I eliminate
‘Cause all the women hate when niggas tend to fake
Man, I’m finna shake, the fakes and frauds
Stick to the script and break some broads
‘Cause that’s the way you do it when you out that Bay
P-to the-L-to-the-A-Y-A

[Outro: Miami the Most talking]
