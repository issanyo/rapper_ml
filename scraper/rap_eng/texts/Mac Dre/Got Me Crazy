[Verse 1: Mac Dre]
I hit the block in somthin' clean, they thought it was a rental
2 hunnid diamonds shinin' in my dentals
Twomps, sittin' in the front a bad bitch
In the back a bad bitch, with a bad bitch
I'm 3 deep, sleep never
I'm in the street, financial endeavors
Sweat her? Nigga please, you better bet it
She want a six eight coupe
Gravy wetted
Super unleaded
Nothin' cheap like them 15's knockin' in the back of my seat
Broke beezy
Betta not try ta holla
She muss be on dick dope and cocka auga
Wassup my nogga
It's Mac Drevious
Old school
Like war cuts and stavius
An like them CHP's be clockin' me
Them PHV's
Always knockin' me

[Hook]
The Crest has got me crazy
But I love the way it raised me
The Crest has got me crazy
But I love the way it raised me
The Crest has got me crazy
But I love the way it raised me
The Crest has got me crazy
But I love the way it raised me

[Verse 2: Mac Dre]
I smoke big bomb
Get bomb headers from a dime piece
I'm the kinda nigga that be pimpin' you might find me
Down in Vegas
Fuckin' with some playas
Or maybe in frisco making her get dough
It's so stupid wen I do it
Whoever listen to it
Just got ta get into it oohwee
Chevy bluey
All in my lung
I'm dancing like a fool and they callin' me dumb come
True beezy
Ride in my truck
Quit talking so much go in slob on these nuts

[Hook]
The Crest has got me crazy
But I love the way it raised me
The Crest has got me crazy
But I love the way it raised me
The Crest has got me crazy
But I love the way it raised me

[Verse 3: Mac Dre]
P89 rouga
67 couga
Squattin' through the traffic
Watch how I movaa
51 Cleveland
Leavin' police
Heat jockin'
Lovin' it even ta know me
My homey
Betta known as cuddie
Is buggin' ridin' shotgun goin nutty
I'm Buddy Love
With a bloody glove
In a white Bronco on dubs
When I'm twistin' turnin'
Professor dumpin'
Let rounds from my Calico loose on these mussums
I'm a goose on these punks
For all of ya loot
Man, I'm a brute
I ain't scared ta shoot

[Hook]
The Crest has got me crazy
