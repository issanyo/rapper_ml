Professionals
Professionals on the roll
Start acting like amateurs
Amateurs gon think they doing what we doing, feel me?
So what we're gonna do is keep this thing professional mayne
Yadidamean?
P-R-mothafuckin O Niggas


[Verse 1: Mac Dre]

This ain't no fairy tale, no Hansel and Gretel
No ? kettle, fool it's the ghetto
Heavy metal, pushing on the Chevy pedal
War in the street is the only way the beef is settled
Young monsters with no guilty conscience
Hold a nigga hostage, empty out a cartridge
Scary niggas, do the fuckin ostrich
Hide your head so a nigga can't pop it (blap)
You better watch it, proceed with caution
Act like an alien, we'll treat you like a martian
My Ponderosa, 69 from Santa Rosa
No sir, we don't drink mimosa
Bro you ain't know?  Homeboy, I been a fool
Hop in the old school, ? low then bend a few
Baggy Girbauds sagging, T-Shirts and tennis shoes
Give a nigga the blues, fight a fool win or lose
Never seen talking to 5-0 or giving clues
Read about me running from 5-0 on the news
We tryna go but 5-0 be sending fools
They bending fools, boy you know what they tend to do
See men on the DL is what I'm finna do
Hit the sto' fo' mo' OJ, Gin and Juice
It's 10 to 2 I'm on a mission like always
Tryna have my mail longer than hallways
Breaking every single one of my bitches, they all pay
Since little league ball days that bitches would call Dre

[Phone rings]
[Ho:] Hello Dre?

[Dre:] Whaaat Bitch?

Ya'll niggas tote heaters, my niggas tote ovens
40 cal hold about a dozen
I'll kill your cousin, make him eat blood
I'm just a thug, from the Country Club
Nigga what? sex, money and murder
We ballas, touch more cheese than hamburgers (HAMBURGERS?)
I pack a squirter, extended clip
Cause these blade ass niggas, they tend to trip
Stuart littles, with no viddles
Fuck with me, get sent to hospitals
I don't be playing, I get to spraying
Before you pull a lick, put some mac dre in
