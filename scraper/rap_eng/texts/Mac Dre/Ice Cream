[Verse 1: Mac Dre]
Niggas don't like me, feds try to indict me
Police fright me, I fight my bitch nightly
I'm serious, but she's taking me lightly
And these punk MC's is always trying to bite me
They can't rap like me, pimp in new Nikes
I yoke and slang old schools tightly
I'm hyphy but don't know what that nigga might be
He might be, weak like light tea
I see, these niggas is trying to strike me
Out the program, they got me slightly
Fucked up! Must be tripping off the wifey
She sucked me rightly, then blew me politely
Then I told Lil' CS, now we gets it nightly
Like me, that bitch can't psych me
She likes me cause my mouth is icy
But in the pen, I couldn't get no one to write me

[Hook 4X]
I fuck with Brotha Lynch's and Andre Nickatina's
Fo fortys, fo fos, tens and even ninas

[Verse 2: Brotha Lynch Hung]
He was star struck first
Fiending for power, I didn't give it to him
Gave it to him out of the passenger seat of a hearse
I dump first, my nigga, you can get it worse
Hit the back right when I back out, blaow blaow
Get away with the purse
I'mma murk you then I'll get your family hurt (Why?)
It don't matter, we lurkin', rip the head off your skirt
Something vicious, I'm suspicious
Lynch going up in your misses mistress with the dizznick
My nigga, it's just the sickness
And the twisted, the nigga sick shit
Ripping your brain tissues with the stainless issue
And it ain't no thing to get you
I can maim you, entertain you with this insane in the membrane
And them lames couldn't hang with dude
I spit rain and split flames at y'all borough
Smoke 'em like a Marlboro cigarette
And I'm a sicker vet and I don't have to get with 'em yet
Catch em' on the low, put it in the hole
Made sick put 'em on the plate, this you better know

[Hook]
