(“I be straight Chev’ strikin’”)
(“Money-makin’, hoochie-sinkin’ Crestside playa”)

[Verse 1]
I roll a ’73 Chevy Caprice
Straight stocked out hubcaps and elites
A four-door mob shot, that’s what I got
Burn a little rubber on a punk ass sahob
A fat ass fleet that’s pumpin’ the beat
A Zapco board to make things complete
I ride and side, whip and dip
Spotted in the seat with a joint on my lip
Ready to take the cops on a high-speed chase
Put up your pink slip ‘cause I’m ready to race
Man, I’m so tight, I just blow right
Past a muthafucka and yes his hoe might
Flag me down the next time she see me
But flaggin’ down Dre ain’t that easy
Steady lookin’ out for the black-and-white ones
So I can hit the gas, swing some tight ones
In my mob shot Chevrolet, I roll every day
And bullshit tapes I’ll never play
I bump $hort and Spice, and MC Pooh
That gangsta shit, I thought you knew
Man, I’m so cool, in my old school
Steady pullin’ bitches when I hit the high school
Short and tall, light and heavy
They all wanna ride in my Chevy

[Chorus 4X]
(“I be straight Chev’ strikin’”)
(“Listen to the bassline, don’t it sound funky”)
