Paroles de la chanson Dollalalalala Lotsa Paypa :
(feat. KC Bobcat, Sauce)

Dolllalala Lots Of Paper
Dolllalala Lots Of Paper
Preppy Pimp Crestside Riders
Broke 150's And Top Siders
Whoops Upside Her Head If She Comes Short
Bread Im A Gunfolk Yea Im A Cut Throat
Backwood Burner
Mach And Murder
I Pack The Squirter When I Blap The Squirter
Whose Gon Fall Like Tall Timber
Killin Off The Whole Gang All Members

Come In Hurr Never Magnum
She Better Have Them Or Im Never Stabbin
Whatever Happened To The Girl From The South
Suck A Dick So Good They Called Her Pussy Mouth
Pussy's Foul But They Heads They Plus
If I Put Her In Heels And A Little Make Up
And Hit Vvegas Will She Make Us
Dollalalala Lots Of Pape
