[Intro: Mac Dre speaks]
Biitch
Im just gettin looser
You know
Tryna do my De La Soul thang up in here

[Verse1: Mac Dre]
Shes been wearin' tight clothes, so I can recognize her yoak
Tryna take me down, but shes been goosing all my folks
Tyna get to him, to get to him, to get me
But Iv got 20/20 vision, Bitch! I can see!
You say "hey! If I want Dre, I must first get in the Circle,"
"I heard he likes them half way dykes them Backwood blunts with purple"
First you get Rydah, said to keep this on the under
Scrolled through his fucking phone and got my beeper number
But the numbay was faultay, thats when you called up Kilo
Gave him some bombjaw, said keep this on the delow
Not knowing what was going on, Kilo called me from your phone
Now its on! Bitch you wrong, you won't leave me the hell alone

[Hook: Mac Dre]
Leave me alone
Will you, bitch leave me alone
Can you, bitch leave me alone
Come on bitch, leave me alone

[Verse2: Rydah J Klyde]
Well check it out, it goes like this
I hold my mic tight like my dick when I piss
Im, in the lab cook cah cooking up hits
Got 36 bars more than 36 zips
It flips so quick, im a witness to this
Trying to get this package to ship
Im out crackin my whip
Im not answering shit
Check my celly I got 36 missed
Shit its my B, she was pissed
Probably thinks im in a bitch
Got little miss riding my dick
Thick thighs and some hips
Im thinking Highs and some Rick
Turned up my phones on it was back to the Tip
Kind of reminds you of a nigga on the grind
And the hood rats call him all the time
To see if hes really out pumpin them dimes
And little mama just tryna buy my time
Bitch leave me alone

[Outro: Rydah J Klyde]
Biyacth Leave me alone
Quit callin my phone bitch leave me alone
Yeah haha Leave me alone
Bitch
