I'm out of here
I gotta go
No time to chop it up
I've got to go

[Verse 1]
I'm a raw dog y'all tryin' to shake the kennel
I stay in underbuckets and I ride in rentals
Cause the rollers wanna pinch me, wash me, rinse me
Brick wall, razor wire, behind the fence me
Put me where thy mother can't kiss me
Put me where thy brother gon' miss me
I stay off the phone, I take dumb ways home
I let my beard grow and my hair get long, it's on
I'm gone, nigga, if I stay I'm cooked
I'm seein' police everywhere I look (Ugh)
It's off the hook, I've never been scarier
My niggas say "Boy, if they catch you they gon' bury ya"
Leave the area, live on a farm
And keep a long sleeve shirt for them tats on your arm

[Chorus: x2]
I'm on the run
Packin my Gun, havin' no fun
Caught in the cross
Lost when I thought I had won

[Verse 2]
Man, I'm washed, tryin to shake John Walsh
America's Most tryin' to say I'm a crime boss
I'm getting lost, boy, I'm finna head for the hills
It's survival skills, I'm on the run for real
I'm always in different loads
Switchin' and ditchin' loads
Pistols, I'm grippin those
Mixed officials, I'm hittin' those
I'm watched and can't avoid it
The cops got me noided
Every time they hit I'm flushin' shit down the toilet
Them bitches can't spoil it, I gets further
Can't stick me with the murder
They witness, I'mma hurt her
I got a squirter with a 50-round drum
And when they people come, dude, I make it hum

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
They tryin' to stick me with a grand jury indictment
So I ride and I creep with a alias license
My license got a picture of me with a different name
I'm hyphy, could you picture me in a different game?
I'm dippin', mayne, I'm different, mayne, call me Casper
Get ghost faster, you hear them flowmasters
High-speed pursuit, potna, I'mma scoot
I got jukes, patterns and routes
It's bye bye now, nigga I ride out
I slide out and dip to my hideout
Boy, I shakes the spot 'cause nigga I'm not
Tryin' to go to Lompoc for 3 hots and a cot

[Chorus]

I'm on the run
