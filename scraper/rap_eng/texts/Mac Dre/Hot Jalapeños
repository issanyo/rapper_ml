[Intro: Mac Dre]
("Maybe someday she'll get run over or something.")
By a tricycle!
("That's what I pray for every night.")
And ten more bicycles!

Yeah, erry night
I don't like the bitch
I hate the bitch
Ya know, fuck the bitch

[Verse 1: Mac Dre]
Now before I start rapping, I must warn ya
I just washed down two mushrooms with some orange juice
I was thizzin' when I wrote this, forgive me if it goes astray
It's just one of the many dumb flows of Dre

I'm tryna see G's, play these hoes like CD's
Old school like the Bee Gee's, Billy Green and some Wheaties
You don't want to see these, I don't give no freebies
Ho, this dick cost, what you thought, I fucked with stingies??

Give me, send me, bring me what you got
Then baby maybe I'll love like my two Glocks
I'm too hot, I do not, fuck with no havers
I'm a Crestside cut-throat, a cold toe-tagger
A ho capturer, then keep 'em in captivity
You ain't know about that niggity, Driggity, M-Diggity?

[Hook: Smoov-E]
I mob like Durango, seat tilted lay-low, boy
I bring heat like one hot jalapeño
I mob like Durango, seat tilted lay-low, boy
I bring heat like one hot jalapeño

[Verse 2: Smoov-E]
Smoov with the groove, when I run right thru, and boy I just might pull it
With a all black hat, and a fat dro sack, bring heat just like a bullet
Got a all new fits and a brand new bitch
For this girl, dick's a no-no, so
I picked up a bottle of Captain Morgan's, took her to the mo-mo

I had to hit the cho-cho
Boy this ain't no ho stroll
But in my town these girls get clowned like they first name was Bobo
Can't shake E, or break E, stay around like a 12 day hickey
Girl it's tasty, like Lacey, took it all like a wide-mouth Mickey

[Hook: Smoov-E]
I mob like Durango, seat tilted lay-low, boy
I bring heat like one hot jalapeño
I mob like Durango, seat tilted lay-low, boy
I bring heat like one hot jalapeño

[Verse 3: Smoov E]
This game gets sticky, these hoes get tricky
Ya boy gets picky, see I hang with Nicky
And cats like Mac Dre, we dress in khaki
That backup band bass, shows how much this rap pay
We kicks with Mary, Jane and Judy
My piece like Larry cause getting ass is my duty
Don't trip or slip, just do my thang
Smoov pimped out like a pinky ring

[Hook: Smoov-E]
I mob like Durango, seat tilted lay-low, boy
I bring heat like one hot jalapeño
I mob like Durango, seat tilted lay-low, boy
I bring heat like one hot jalapeño

[Outro: Mac Dre]
Something's got ta happen, something's definitely got to happen
I hope she get ran the fuck over
I never did like the bitch, I mean I never liked-ed the bitch
Y'all were the ones hooping an' hollering about the fucked up bitch
Fuck the bitch
