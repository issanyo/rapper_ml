One smokin (here we go again)
Back in sabaster pool (sabaster pool)
With my hash brown (my hash brown)
Smoov-E (smoov-e)
Understand me
Smoov muthafuckin e
And me MD
From the V

I come from a place where the dope fiends base
And it's hard to keep the rollers out your face
Keep a strap on your lap in the back in the sack
And a fat sap cold for the base (for the base)
X, sex, latex
Love the cose by avorex
Hyphy fools in nike shoes
We pay to win and don't like to lose
A lot of bear caps and cal bear hats
Lookin for some chasy on the loose (chasy on the loose)
Golddiggin bitches try to get through to your riches
Now tell me ain't that the truth
Is you pimpin ain't no second nigga try to get it hella quick
We rhyme, grind all the time sometimes might pull a lip
It's hella hoggish slightly doggish
September till the end of august
It's MD in the place to be
Back with my cutthoat Smoov-E

When I'm weedless
I'm a fiend
And I need this

We smokes (we smokes) our grass (our grass)
And sometimes it's laced with hash (not laced with hash)
They shakes (they shakes) they ask (they ask)
And sometimes we take they cash (we take they cash)

My girlfriend caroline just a little bit of this
Not only is gon let me have on mine
And nobody but two of her girlfriends
Snow white (who?)
This is 65 african ganji

I want you to take me to... yo house (yo house)
Put some icy tonas on... my feet (my feet)
Pay for the wheels on... my wagon (my wagon)
You know
Pick up the tab on the place that I'm saggin (I'm saggin)
Cause that's what you need to do (that's what you need to do)
Like that girl (like that girl)
That's what you need to do

You brought yourself didn't bring sex
Can't hang with eating all the mex
With no head n shoulder
You think your getting cold but boy it gets colder
Boulder bash your expectations
Hot with heat with a kind of relations
You live a dream but you ain't got heem
Tell me you a balla but you ain't got a team
Can't break a bitch and go skeel
Hoe betta bring me my pills
You can't play me with ya old mercedez
Gotta give some for the grown man gravy
Hazey baby come with cabbage
Three new bras is a weekly avarege
A young mac know the dick to the purse
Hit it from the back
Climbing in reverse
She had high socks and skirt like a nurse
She wasn't that fine but it sure gets worse
Might start slow with a quick finish
Hands to the head
Wouldn't hold in it
Wiggle what ya momma gave ya
Don't my my behavior
Wiggle what ya poppa gave ya
Don't mind my missbehavior

We smokes (we smokes) our grass (our grass)
And sometimes it's laced with hash (not laced with hash)
They shakes (they shakes) they ask (they ask)
And sometimes we take they cash (we take they cash)

With a hat to the side big d in the ride take you out your panties
