[Intro]
(Mac Dre):Rocc, she look kinda cool huh
I like the look but what's in the purse mayne?
The look is cool mayne, but baby what's in the purse?
The look is cool...

[Verse 1: Mac Dre]
He don't get out it cause he think he can't afford it
I'ma play the bitch like a tape recorder, I make nacho
I get cheese and chips she don't got dough? I'ma leave the bitch
Cause a bitch with no money can't give me no money, she always laughing but ain't a damn thing funny
The joke's on you baby, you're through baby pretty face and big booty just ain't gone do baby
Where I'm from? bitch you's a loser
I'm a woozer? Nigga I'ma use her make the bitch run like she still in [?] and get thick faces
I'm Mac Dre this the big ole pimp
He in the Benz behind the tint
4 EV's 4 EP's playing BBD's going off three G's

[Verse 2]
I get money nigga, she get money bring it all to me
Stalking a [?] put miles on her feet yeah I know
I'm this, I'm that I ain't shit but I'm only out to ball leave it all on that bitch on my whips
On my fits and on my chips we got big grip, big deals and big hits plus I spit big game
Get up in your bitch brain convince her to get changed motherfucka it's a pimp thang
That's trill mayne I'm all about stacking a grill (while my hands are writing raps count cash and slapping a bitch)
I'm up in this bitch when I do this, nigga I recruit chicks like the high school in a young bitch ear like a cutip

[Hook]
In the skates or at the mall, I'm still collecting drawls whether darksin or red bones, fresh hair and painted toes
When I leave they're on my phone, cause I'm all in their dome
And my goal's to hook them all, to make my cash withdawls

[Verse 3]
[?] produced big body tours
Now I peace like a cannon it's so heated
Dime piece she understand it so I feel I beat it
Dropped her off then skeet see I'm a young Mac
Manipulating young racks to get my chips, [?] to my lips tricks follow her here
Get more cheese than [?] sit on cheese and whips [?] to get cheese
Call me valvida mob is dangerous like a 7o with a heater
Said her name was [?] you don't need her non-profit organization let the whip fill feeder
With pimp shit I greet her campaign like I'm running for office
Campaign cause you know who the boss is
It's genuine [?] Sidewayz spin the past winning all fast
Money off the track like their [?] these squares ain't eating

[Verse 4]
I've been on some whole other shit
But it's time to go I been first to get to moving on a nigga like he was a prison snitch
Scrubbing niggas off the map like some Ajax stuck a pitbull bitch watch out for this pimp attack
I got to lace this track like a taylor lace a Mac
Explaining how I make money fall out the buttcrack
Eyes glossed up from fucking with the ecstacy silly [?]
Best to be dude always on your P's and Q's like Brotha Lynch mayne [?] refuse to lose
But in this game you guaranteed to get knocked and bruised
But stay pimping dude [?]

[Verse 5]
Well it's official I'm a factor in these streets (streets)
We jack niggas for beats and give a fuck about making enemies off Hennessey and Remy so I'm a goddamn fool
Catch a bitch with a government check and I'ma cop that too
Take the DF tattoo but it's not for dungeon families thats for [?] finest tell me do you understand me?
I'm sour, never sweet like candy bitches tryna get at me cause of this pimping mentality [?] now they mad at me
For the shit that I did to this kid got her coming out that dig now we're doing it big
We stacking up chips to back niggas up off the dick cause they hating all on my status [?] to living lavish
But I still manage to remain savage avoid faggots got it snatching habits dangnabbit its cold mackin
Snatch up for this fame if you lames can't feel me and dig deep off in your brain and put this thang to make you feel me

[Hook x2]
