[Verse 1: Keak Da Sneak]
Wife-beater, jeans, blue Air Max's
[?] hit a nigga for glasses
Sucker comes, ass kicked, still slide in plastic
Closed caskets, niggas be blasting
When a nigga write a check then his ass can't cash it
Told you handle the ball but you want to pass it
In the [?] nigga, now going the other way
Man I was just visiting but now we back in the Bay
Straight black and granite I hit the ho like [?]
[?] just considered it TD'ed
Signed out of high school, skipped college for all pro
Fuck a scholarships I'm signing contracts for major dough
What you in it for? nigga that million dollar brain
With a hundred thousand karats on my bling
And I'm the whole team, [?] 22 inch stance
I'm like [?] calling a sack out of sprint

[Hook]
I feed my bitch, with nathan but game (nathan but game)
Her last nigga tried to spit it, but it ain't the same (it's not the same)
I feed my bitch, with nathan but game (nathan but game)
Her last nigga tried to spit it, but it ain't the same (it's not the same)
I feed my bitch, with nathan but game (nathan but game)
Her last nigga tried to spit it, but it ain't the same (it's not the same)
I feed my bitch, with nathan but game (nathan but game)
Her last nigga tried to spit it, but it ain't the same (it's not the same)

[Verse 2]
I know ho's that get straight to the point
The bitch will hit the dick before she hit the joint
Lick it up, nut sucking on balls and toes
Taking numbers on these little low nasty ho's
Back it up, let me see your box of pearls
Keep dick in your mouth and you bet not hurl
Girl tell me, have you served a pimp before?
Do your boyfriend know that you a prostitute?
Working on a trick, flushing out chips in clubs
Get your punk ass back on track, suck and fuck
Bitch what? I could give a fuck about ya
B-A dot kamikaze clowned ya
Found ya, found ya, ho I'm proud ta
Be a pimp that will beat a bitch and bounce up
Now up in niggas like some wrapping dimes
While you selling cot I be popping cons

[Hook]
I feed my bitch, with nathan but game (nathan but game)
Her last nigga tried to spit it, but it ain't the same (it's not the same)
I feed my bitch, with nathan but game (nathan but game)
Her last nigga tried to spit it, but it ain't the same (it's not the same)
I feed my bitch, with nathan but game (nathan but game)
Her last nigga tried to spit it, but it ain't the same (it's not the same)
I feed my bitch, with nathan but game (nathan but game)
Her last nigga tried to spit it, but it ain't the same (it's not the same)

[Verse 3: Mac Dre]
A nigga almost snapped, trapped behind bars
But now on the streets I pull freaks around bars
Fast cars, hash cigars, no more sneaking balloons past the guards
I flip whips like a baller flips kicks
I'm the almighty mack, Andre Hicks
Ritz, cracker, smoke [?] in hot sauce
[?] smoke and kill while I cot toss
Shots off in my twelve inch ride
You thinking about catching me slipping? Partner I wouldn't try
I got a forty and when I'm in the fifty I dump and go zero to sixty, swiftly
Skurt skeet with Bart and Keak
Getting further from the scene while I'm mobbing with my heat
I sleep with a toy 'cause I don't trust no-motherfucking-body boy, I'm a cutthroat

[Hook]
I feed my bitch, with nathan but game (nathan but game)
Her last nigga tried to spit it, but it ain't the same (it's not the same)
I feed my bitch, with nathan but game (nathan but game)
Her last nigga tried to spit it, but it ain't the same (it's not the same)
I feed my bitch, with nathan but game (nathan but game)
Her last nigga tried to spit it, but it ain't the same (it's not the same)
I feed my bitch, with nathan but game (nathan but game)
Her last nigga tried to spit it, but it ain't the same (it's not the same)
