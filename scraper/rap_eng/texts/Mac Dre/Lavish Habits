[Hook: Harm]
Got myself an Uzi and my brother a nine
In these streets you live one day at a time
Got myself an Uzi and my brother a nine
In these streets you watch your back I’ll watch I

[Verse 1: Mac Dre]
Old school like Rowdy Roddy, or La Di Da Di
Only play for Cali teams like Vlade
Quick to turn out the muthafuckin’ party
Beam me up, Scotty, ‘fore I murk somebody
I know ca-razy, don’t know karate
Square nigga get smacked with the 12-gauge shotty
Black John Gotti, I do it mobby
Beat niggas for a hobby like The Beast Mugabi
About 9-1-1, my niggas, it’s urgency
Somebody getting sent to emergency
I’m in a burgundy Monarch from Mercury
I got new whips but I guess it’s the turf in me
You never heard of me? Nigga, wake up
I’m the really real, them niggas is cake up
Do it thuggish ruggish, all the time
Keep myself an Uzi and my brother a nine

[Hook: Harm]
Got myself an Uzi and my brother a nine
In these streets you live one day at a time
(One day, one day)
Got myself an Uzi and my brother a nine
In these streets you watch your back I’ll watch I

[Verse 2: Reek Daddy]
You watch your back, and I’ll watch I
It’s me against the wall like Biggie, Ready To Die
My Uzi weigh a ton, I still pack a gun
I’m still an outlaw, living life on the run
My life is no fun, I take it one day at a time
(Bought myself an Uzi and my brother a nine)
So I could enjoy the sunshine when I’m pushing my whip
Top down on the strip with 50 in my clip
Just in case emergency and niggas wanna trip
Runnin’ off at the lip, you niggas’ll get hit
I leave you lit like a Bic for talkin’ shit, how you hit
Cats don’t know what you dealing with, my niggas are sick
And when we ride through, we walk the walk with no talk
Beanie and boost the troops outlined in yellow chalk
Think I’m playing? Ask the dead man was I playing
When I bust two shots through his dome and left him laying on the ground

[Hook: Harm]
Got myself an Uzi and my brother a nine
In these streets you live one day at a time
(One day, one day)
Got myself an Uzi and my brother a nine
In these streets you watch your back I’ll watch I

Got myself an Uzi and my brother a nine
In these streets you live one day at a time
Got myself an Uzi and my brother a nine
In these streets you watch your back I’ll watch I
