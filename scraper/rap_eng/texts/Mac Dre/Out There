[Hook 2X]
When I'm out there with my team
I'm out there slanging green
Trying to get my dough, let the game go
Put up my triple beam

[Verse 1]
My team consists of soft cookers, doff jookers
And a couple of boss hookers
I don't care if it's raining or snowing
Man, them bitches is gonna be out there hoeing
And me, I'm gonna be on this mic flowing
And the Cutts is gonna be collected from niggas that's owing
Nigga, you ain't knowing, I gets mine
I did too much time to be wasting time

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
You must didn't understand what I was talkin' 'bout
When I said "get in the game, get rich, and get out"
Now you're stuck in it, don't got no luck in it
Trying to put the whip on it and extra stuff in it
Partner, I reckon if you put on some of these pimp glasses
And take a couple of these pimp classes
You're gonna realize life moves fast
And you don't get too many chances

[Hook]
