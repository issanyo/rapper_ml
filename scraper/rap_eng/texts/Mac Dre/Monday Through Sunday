[Into: Mac Dre]
Macramento
Richmond, Vallejo, Oakland
Pittsburgh, Berkley, Santa Rosa, Gilroy
Modesto, Stockton
Oakland, did I say Oakland?
Yeah, did I say Vallejo?

[Verse 1: Mac Dre]
I eat a nigga like jello
Play a bitch like cello
I'm the kind of fellow that will "yee" instead of "hello"
I do it acapello, or in the mix
The almighty mack, Andre Hicks
I'm versatile you can catch me at the [?]
Doing everything from fly fishing to badminton
When I'm ass hitting, I'm in it like a [?]
Eat a thing long, a crustacean
Grew up with Sisters, [?], Asians and Caucasians
I stay blazing, nothing but the best
Where I'm from? Bitch, the Crest
The wild wild west, California
Floss too hard a nigga might pull up on ya
I like Beanie, I like Kiss, I like Jigga
But them niggas act different, I'm a West Coast nigga

[Hook]
Monday I'm politicking through the ghetto
Tuesday backseat with mommies and amaretto
Wednesday it's pimping hookers in stilettos
Thursday I'll probably swoop looking for that hello
Friday I'm at a throwback with my fellows
Saturday off in the club, spending dinero
Sunday I'm out in traffic to the pedal
Seven days a week out in these streets, I just can't let go

[Verse 2: Mac Dre]
Fresh dressed like a skrillion bucks
Threw on my suede chucks, I don't give a fuck
Mouth full of jewels, I'm a fool
Come through mashing and dipping an old school
Ho's choose, 'cause partner I'm a pimp
I eat prawns I don't eat skrimp
California exempt on my tail
I go to jail, I post bail
Live the life of a California rap star
Many concert house parties in the backyard
Point you in your north star, Vallejo nigga
I don't smoke it if it don't have the smell nigga
Take a bitch up, fuck, take her money, cut
California thug roller, nigga what?
Like Messy Marv, Cougnut, the Bigga Figga
RBM and 40, I'm a Bay nigga

[Hook]
Monday I'm politicking through the ghetto
Tuesday backseat with mommies and amaretto
Wednesday it's pimping hookers in stilettos
Thursday I'll probably swoop looking for that hello
Friday I'm at a throwback with my fellows
Saturday off in the club, spending dinero
Sunday I'm out in traffic to the pedal
Seven days a week out in these streets, I just can't let go

[Verse 3: Mac Dre]
Zapco board, Zeus amps
Flanel tops and chrome lamps
Six wheels car sitting A1
Your guy, from the Bay son
Everything we ride is high pro
Shut the freeway down, have a sideshow
All night though, I might go
Post up with a breezy and some light though
That's my life bro, I thought you heard
Like Darius Rucker nigga [?]
The rapper gone bad, Mac Dre boy
And this is what we do in the Bay boy

[Hook]
Monday I'm politicking through the ghetto
Tuesday backseat with mommies and amaretto
Wednesday it's pimping hookers in stilettos
Thursday I'll probably swoop looking for that hello
Friday I'm at a throwback with my fellows
Saturday off in the club, spending dinero
Sunday I'm out in traffic to the pedal
Seven days a week out in these streets, I just can't let go
