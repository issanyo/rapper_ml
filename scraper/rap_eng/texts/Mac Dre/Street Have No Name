[Verse 1]
I run the streets with cold cats, we perks and smoke fats
We down like four flats, some call 'em my folks, black
Me and my potent crew is tighter than toes in shoes
There's only a chosen few that I might be closer to
We share clothes, hoes and never with closed doors
On folks disclose 'cause close folks'll sure roll
My potnas will lie for me, take that dive for me
My woman'll cry for me but they kill and die for me
We all from the same track, and all used to slang crack
We all got game fat and scrilla remain stacked
My folks is road dogs like Caine and O-Dog
Some others is so-called, friends but go and dog
So I shake the fake, with faith, I stay true
'Cause me and my folks that's close is way cool
My folks

[Hook: Sly Stone]
It's a family a-
It's a family affair
(My folks)
It's a family a-
It's a family affair

It's a family a-
It's a family affair
It's a family a-
It's a family affair

[Verse 2]
Whenever I'm doin' bad, my folks'll gimme cash
Look out for a nigga fast, and man, when it's time to blast
There's never no compromise whenever the drama flies
We makin' some mamas cry, 'cause it's gon' be homicide
So suckas they stay back 'cause they know we stay strapped
And man we go way back like Murray's and wave caps
I've known 'em for hella years, they just like my relatives
And that's what we tell our kids so this'll forever live
My folks is dedicated, ghetto educated
Some people really hate it 'cause they know we can't be faded
We just like the Wu-Tang whenever we do thangs
It's always a crew thang 'cause that's how the crew swang
So if you ain't knowin' me, my folks is royalty
And all that they owin' me is love and loyalty
'Cause we shake the fake with faith and stay true
Me and my folks that's close is way cool
My folks
My folks
My folks

[Hook: Sly Stone]
It's a family a-
It's a family affair
It's a family...
