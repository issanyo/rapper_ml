Rat-tat-tat-tat

[ VERSE 1: Mac Dre ]
I grew up in the Bay Area around a gang of robbin and shootin
Looked up to legends like Felix Mitchell, Huey P. Newton
And Todd Shaw a/k/a Too $hort
Blowin big hashish with dank that'll make you choke
Young Mac Dre, causin' major damage
Back in the days I tossed hoes in the back of my ham sandwich
Grown, gone on bomb seedless hemp
Hound for potential prostitutes who need a pimp
But now I'm bendin' corners, fresh out the rallies
Chokin' on roper in the back of Denali's
Drinkin' that snake bite, Yukon Jack
And boy, I ain't right without my strap
'Cause them cutthroat bandits will split yo' wig
In the streets of Killafornia, ya dig?
It's goin' down, dog, I'm in your town, dog
Got to let your peeps know how I clown, dog
In the end get it, comin' with that Blackhand sound
You thinkin' I can't clown? Let me put my mack hand down

[ Hook 2X ]
[ Killa ] How yo hood look?
[ Dre ] It's full of gangsters, fool
How yo' hood look?
[ Killa ] It's full of gangsters, son
You can catch me on the Eastside, doin' my thing
[ Killa ] Or you can me in New York, boy, it's all the same

[ VERSE 2: Killa ]
I'm from the Eastside, where the thugs, they shed blood for nothin'
After the club you get it in your mug if you frontin'
We gangbang, it's just that our slang's a little different
Aim a little different, spit game a little different
Got in with the Mexicans, pricin' them things a little different
Same kinda crooks, but we cook up bricks a little different
Them old school Chevrolets, dot-six Range a little different
Y'all gats and guns the same, but we blow brains a little different
Them drive-by's, we walk-by's, some die a little different
Lie a little different, testify a little different
Y'all trees ain't got seeds, y'all beez a little different
The D's is different, my P's a little different
Y'all sell bricks, we break it down, get cheese a little different
Y'all hate narcs, we hate cops, we eat a little different
Y'all got strips, we got spots, our blocks a little different
It get hot a little different, fools get knocked a little different
When the feds came, yo Dre, they took the whole block to prison
My man pops was snitchin', his face chopped in Clinton
If you got change and the gear hot, then switch spots, get missin'
Yo' hood ain't no different, my hood ain't no different

[ Dre ]
In my neighborhood everybody thuggin'
Hoodrats steady gettin' dug in
Fools buggin', mean-muggin'
Later on you seem 'em nuggin'
[ Killa ]
Dre, I play my hood all day
Seen a fool get killed in broad day
Thugs get money from the hallway
2 for 5, the tall way
[ Dre ]
Ghetto slang, ghetto game
We all just doin' that ghetto thang
Run around totin' them metal thangs
Really, homeboy, it's all the same
[ Killa ]
Your hood is like my hood, son
Anywhere you go thugs pullin' guns
Gangbangers, ghetto birds
Your hood is like my hood, ya heard?
[ Dre ]
Me and Killa finna let you know
How to put a lick down and get some dough
From your hood to Mexico
'Cause it's all about that paper, though
[ Killa ]
Put me up with Vallejo hoe
That puff on hay, stay on the low
Dre got work, 800 a O
Eastside thugs make money, you know?
[ Dre ]
I don't care where we at
Just as long as we keep smokin' fat
Get a fifth of Heem and hopin' that
Everybody wanna stay chokin', black
[ Killa ]
I told you, Dre, our hood ain't changed
Duckin' em well, slingin' em things
Fools rock Rolies and diamond rings
Respect the game, our hood's the same
