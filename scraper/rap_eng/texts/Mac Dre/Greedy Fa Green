[Hook: Mac Dre]
Big things is what she brings
'Cause she love to see daddy gleem and bling bling, boy
Keep a queen on my team
Who ain't riding in a bucket that knocks and pings
I need lots of green, sometimes I cock the thing
And catch a motherfucker slipping with lots of cream
I'm on heem, feeling like yiddimean
No scavengers we savages and greedy for green

[Verse 1: PSD]
Ain't no puzzle we hustle for cheddar, I won't never
Love her, won't fuck and steer hutch I want headers
Better drench her than wet her when I leave bad weather
Heifer you ain't on my level, speak on treasure
Said to me "I'll take care of you, I'll do whatever"
Gold or platinum bezel whatever I pleasure
Or settle to be my precious and keep me fresher
My man squeeze or flex up, she won't pester
Blessed her, made her cop the [?]
I get bad on these ho's, know I gotta be careful
Bag tags on my load plus I'm ducking my tester
Now I scare on the ho fuck with nothing but breaders

[Verse 2: Dubee]
Big dough is what she tote
'Cause she love a general, spending fresh dough
Boy, your nigga keep a ho on bottom row
Who be riding in a bucket with no dinero
If it's all copping blow, still I got some mo
Track dragons, goddamit on the lock for dope
Lock and load, I bring it from the stones I hold
Preaching it my thesis be leaving 'em like froze
And now I goes, ripping the micro-phone
When it's on I'm head hunting with fo'
Heat seekers in a row that dismantle your dome
I'm prone [?] in your home

[Sleep Dank]
I know by the conversation circling my seat
I rock shit, known as Mr. S-L double E-P D-A-N-K
Out the sunroof blasting my heat
Beat a sucker with a gun handle fucking with me
Gorilla pimping nigga, my knuckles drag down to the streets
Boss hog nigga from the dirt, tossed up with a freak
I'm like what, I'm like hey when it come to some jeans
Work a chickenhead to death until she can't even breathe
'Til her heels fall off, what do you mean?
Slip slide so clean
500 niggas in the do', bitch follow me
Put on shiny shoes, pass me my weed
Cross a bitch up to the point where she won't think shit sweet
