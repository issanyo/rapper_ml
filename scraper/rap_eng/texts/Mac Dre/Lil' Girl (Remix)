[Intro: Mac Dre]
Old bitch good riddance
I don't want a cat, I want a kitten
Here Kitty kitty kitty kitty

[Hook: The Doors/Jim Morrison]
Show me the way
To the next little girl
Oh, don't ask why
Oh, don't ask why

Show me the way
To the next little girl
Oh, don't ask why
Oh, don't ask why

[Verse 1: Mac Dre]
Big titties, big booty Betsy
She was only 17 but she was sexy
And then there's Becky, 18 and a half-er
She run like Donner, Rudolph, and Prancer
No, I didn't have to romance her
But once I caught her, I couldn't shake her like cancer
And oh yeah, nigga, what about Ilene?
She a fiend but she only nineteen
20-year-old Claire and her best friend Blair
They square but they came as a pair
Show me the way to the next little girl
No '89 earthquake bitches for Furl
I don't want nothin' old but the money
A Tina Turner bitch can't do nothing for me
Punk rock? I'm Mac Dreezy
Show me the way to the next young beezy

[Hook: The Doors/Jim Morrison]
Show me the way
To the next little girl
Oh, don't ask why
Oh, don't ask why

Show me the way
To the next little girl
Oh, don't ask why
Oh, don't ask why

[Verse 2: Smoov-E]
I knew it was wrong boy, I had to risk it
To bang the biscuit, little old Triscuit
7, 5, and 3 zeros
That's my bail, I need Shapiro
I was just having some fun in the telly
Don't Band-Aid like Nelly but bang like R. Kelly
Really? You heard what I said
Now your punk ass was wishin' I wouldn't have done what I did
Lacy, Stacy and the little ol' Haitian
'Smoov-E a sex offender and he on probation'
Don't run your mouth, dog, keep it cool
Got to drop this girl off in front of the high school
These hot ass bitches is barely legal
I'll be serving life sentences for three damn people
Perky ass titties, thick ol' thighs
I slipped a girl a Mickey, your hand full of black flies

[Hook: The Doors/Jim Morrison]
Show me the way
To the next little girl
Oh, don't ask why
Oh, don't ask why

Show me the way
To the next little girl
Oh, don't ask why
Oh, don't ask why

[Verse 3: San Quinn]
Young bitches at the high school
Flossing my riches, I'm so cool
12th graders at least 18 years of age
20 minutes or less in the Escalade
Looking at the TV, porno flickin' it
She grabbin' it, telling me to stick it in
10 inching it, infinite hittin' it
She want to fuck another girl, ask could I fix it up
Away away, to the junior college
All the bitches love the Escalade to my knowledge
Sure enough, pulling up bumping a little beat
Pull a clydesdale slut from the Middle East
She's looking too worthy (Too worthy)
Off two ecstasy pills and it's daytime, only 2:30
Hop in, hop in
She's singing 'Ayo for Yayo'
But she's saying I'm not Quinn (What!)

[Hook: The Doors/Jim Morrison]
Show me the way
To the next little girl
Oh, don't ask why
Oh, don't ask why

Show me the way
To the next little girl
Oh, don't ask why
Oh, don't ask why

[Verse 4: Smoov-E]
I'm with two 16s and they're at my house
One in the bed, the other on the couch
I did one...went to other
Now the boyfriend calling...oh brother
Captain Coke keep morals broke
A lil doke...keep the panties soaked
Twosomes, threesomes, full-on orgies
You could bring the tennis team to my homeboy Georgie's
To me, age ain't nothin' but a number
Make you wonder, girl named Summer
Bitch in the bathroom laid out on the floor
While her friend's next door saying "Damn that whore!"
Always work things out, so proper
Smooth talker, love a panty dropper
Rock ya...and lay you down
If you didn't know then, well boy, you know now

Show me the way to the next little girl
Show me the way...
