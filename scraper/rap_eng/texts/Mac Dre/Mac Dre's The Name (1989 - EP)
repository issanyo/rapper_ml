[Intro]

Yeah let me put this shit out
So I can make this muthafuckin' tape
Mac Dre, Mac Dre in full effect to my Crestside peoples
And it goes a little something like this

[Verse 1]

Dre, the lyrical kingpin
I'm dealing rhymes that got you fiendin'
'Cause every time you hear the name
The rhymes have you kicking like base cocaine
Erotic, exotic, they call me narcotic
'Cause fans get hooked on my funky fresh product
The captain of rappin' and I'm just the Mac and...
??? with ??? and my dollars are stackin'
Steady coming up 'cause I'm getting elevation
Numero uno that means I'm the ace and...
The best who ever did it, I just spit it
A sucker heard me rhyme and he damn near shitted
That's the way it goes with a big ol' mack
Hanging with the boys on the ??? street track
Drinking Hennessy then kick it with a girl
I beat the babbies down and then I hurl
And every time i throw up, you know i roll up
A big fat spliff and then I'm to' up
The very next day i do it all again
But instead of Hennessy I'm sippin' on gin

Mac, Mac, Mac Dre is the name
Mac, Mac, Mac Dre is the name


[verse 2]
You see once upon a time I was convicted
Started writing rhymes and i got addicted
Know every single time I put a pen in my hand
I write a dope rhyme now here I go, again
See I'm an M.C. and Mac Dre's my name
No i don't sport ?kinkles? and i don't wear chains
Fuck being jerked i got my fingers mounted
And the gold stands out while the money is counted
I kick with my posse and my posse is large
Clocking long dollars and the boys are hard
Being down and dirty 'cause it's so damn ruthless
Make the wrong move and you end up toothless
No I'm not joking 'cause i don't tell jokes
I kick with the boys while Ray Cat yokes
Burning long rubber all on your shoes
'Cause a posse like mine is just bad news
See I'm the kinda of brother who like his money
I call a girl bitch, won't call her honey
Just kick back while the money is made
Sippin' on Bird and grape cool-aid
I may talk a little dirty when I rap
But i rap pimp shit not this and that
I'm just a young brotha with so much game
Gettin' busy on the mic and Mac Dre is the name

Mac, Mac, Mac Dre is the name
Mac, Mac, Mac Dre is the name

[Verse 3]
Mac Dre is the name fool, so be cool
And if you want to get taught, then come to my school
And you better pay attention if you don't I'll flunk ya
Do like Michael Jordan, grab ya then dunk ya
Treat you like barbecue, pick you up start to chew
Throw you to the dogs when I'm done and through with you
'Cause I'm just a poet this lyrical vocalist
Suckers stay back, 'cause they all know I'm just a microphone soloist
An individual, steady gettin' deffer while they stay pitiful
Yeah, you guessed it I'm not the nice guy
I treat suckers bad, I'm not the nice one
I'm hard as hell can you tell my rhymes sell?
Just a mack from the town of Vallejo
To my young cuddie Mac yo wussup mayne
I'm nothing nice and Mac Dre's the name

Mac, Mac, Mac Dre is the name
Mac, Mac, Mac Dre is the name
That muthafuckin' name

[Verse 4]
Mac Dre's the name and the fan's stay quiet
Until I come through the door and they start up a riot
Pulling on my pants, shirt and drawers
And that is the moment I have to pause
I mean stop, yo wait a minute, hold up
Boys get the gats, bullets and load up
And if they keep trippin' you better start sprayin'
'Cause I'm not the one you know what I'm sayin?
Some like that shit but I'm not the type
Just give me a mic and watch me get hype
When I'm done yo i hit the back door
Hop in the limo cut to the store
Get a fifth of Hennessy. kick it tough in the V
With my partner Eric B, 'cause he's just a friend of me
And when i say Eric B i don't mean the DJ
I mean the Eric B, who keeps it dope for Mac Dre
The sucker MC killa, so watch me go thrilla
If i see your girl listen I'm just gonna have to pull her
Right off her boyfriend, treat her good till the end
Then leave her in the cold, let her chill out in the wind
Freaky girls, do you hear?
I'm sippin' gin, I don't bend
For this rhyme, it is done
Yo I'm up, out of here

[Outro]
