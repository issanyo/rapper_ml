[Hook 2X]
All damn day, y'all
(All damn day; all damn day)("Mac muthafuckin' Dre")
All damn day, y'all
(All damn day)("I'm gonna rock this muthafucka all night y'all")

[Verse 1]
Microphone check, let me kick to the beat
Dedicated to you bitches, let me spit to you freaks
I'm gonna serve it to you straight a little something like this
Not one of those niggas that be liking to kiss
There's no telling what your tongue licks, it might be big dicks
So you better try kissing on them other tricks
'Cause Lottie Lohawk, I like to bohawk
I know you love when I shove a thrust up in your cot
All damn day

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
I'm MD and mackin' is my duty
So when I step to you girl and tap you on your big booty
And start spittin' some pimpin' ass serious shit
Don't even start trippin' on how freaky you get
It's just a gift to G-A-B, to get to your P-A-D
Bash in your ass, inside of the B-E-D
Went to 415 and not the 012
Now you fiending for more, but you wait 'til I call you
See some of these niggas cold want you to jock 'em
Stupid muthafuckas, but I can't knock 'em
I just wanna bash, hoe, and only get cash, hoe
You want Dre to stay and lay, but I have to pass, hoe
'Cause I'm mackin' all damn day

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
'Cause that lovey dovey shit just ain't gon' get it
When I pick you up to fuck, I straight hit it and quit it
And you dont trip because the sexin' is good
I be wreckin' 'em good and they be back in the hood
Tellin' my cuddies how cool it was
Now another Romp player might give you a buzz
Young C-U-R-T, or maybe young Marty
Or my homeboy J might be your type of party
Whoever it is, they gon' get with you, bitch
And dont even think they gon' sit with you, bitch
No talkin' and walkin' 'cause that shit is funny style
You pay me and lay me and when I take your money I'll...
Spend that shit all damn day

[Hook]

[Verse 4]
I'm hard but saucy, bitch back on off me
Steady tryna toss me, hoe, smell the coffee
I gave you some, hoe, did not cum though
Your too damn dumb, hoe; what you actin' sprung fo'?
I'm hard to get with, pimperistic
I want your lipstick on top of my dick tip
I'm from the V-A double L E-J
O and you know, hoe, the things that we say
Are simple and plain, nothin' but game
And if you ain't up on it, Mac Dre is the name
I want a fat ass joint of that potent zesty
And a thick chocolate bitch whose name is Nestle
From the C-R-E-S-T, 'cause that's where the best be
Suckas get jealous and they try to test me
So I carry a nine all the time
Dope raps I rhyme, this is how I grind
Making stacks of cash, down to wax that ass
A nigga ready to blast a muthafucka real fast
Dickin' the hoes, never lickin' the hoes
Big black dick is what I stick in the hoes
I shake 'em, I break 'em, but never would I take 'em
To eat hamburgers let alone some steak and
Lobster, 'cause baby I'm a mobster
You tell your friends how I robbed ya
All damn day
