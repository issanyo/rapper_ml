[Verse 1: Lil Bruce]
They say pimpin' ain't easy
And nigga, they ain't never lie
We ride back to back thru the track that on suicide
Watch me glide on twenties, get money
Smokin' backwoods on pills, breakin' bitches at will
'Cause it's pimpin'
On professional women limpin' up and down the block
I'm slangin' rocks, I'm slangin' cock
Pimp or die, nigga, I'm so fly, a square is what I'm not
I'm Lil Bruce, baby, I come from the V
The home of Ike Turner, Rose Budd, and MD

[Verse 2: PSD]
You think I'm carin' about sharin' on snatch
And I'm runnin' scams to get my hands on scratch
Understand that
Woman romance without finance to me
Stands no chance with no man of my pedigree
Call my hoggish if you would
Shoulda been a part of Sick Wid It Records
Wit a pig on my necklace
Would you dig my possessions since the air is my gift
Or should it matter if it's turf shit burnt for chips
Nigga, we hurt shit, that way since birth with it
As for this gift to gab shit, mayne, we cursed with it
As far as dirt, we did it
So, nigga, name it, I done it
And love to hit it while she on her stomach
Money and hundreds

[Chorus]
I'm from the V-A double L E-J-O
Where sellin' narcotics is all I know
I'm from the valley where Sally sellin' dank, biiitch
What it is, what it is, what it is

(Mac Dre: I'm from the V-A double L E-J-O)
(B-Legit: Where sellin' narcotics is all I know)

[Verse 3: B-Legit]
I boss up, never fuck, it's red lights on a toss up
Untangle where we crossed up
It's big shit, V-town affiliates
Watch us rip shit, the gangster or the pimp shit
No simp shit, bitch, my mug stay mean
Out the ricks wit' kicks and gun machines
You know the green, the thing we was dying to get
Is the reason why my niggas came so damn sick
And when I represent, bitch, I put it on dubs
Park it by the club and let the rat heads rub
I'm out to get the cheddar
If she fight, nigga, let her
It don't matter, I stay fatter

[Verse 4: Mac Dre]
It don't matter, long as my pockets get fatter
I don't give a fuck if civilians got scatter
I'm the last batter, better hit a home run
When I stick my dick in I watch how fast she cum
Up the block sideways when I shift I chirp quick
And after that first dick, I'm all in your purse, bitch
Mac Drizzay, off the hizzle
Goin' off Hennesizay and a half a thizzle
Romper Roomin', no cartoonin'
Makin' the scrill, keepin' it real
Bitch, you know what I'm doin'

[Chorus 4X]
