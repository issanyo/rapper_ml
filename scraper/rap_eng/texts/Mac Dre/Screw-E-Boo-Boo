All praises due to the Nation of Thizzlam

[Verse 1: Mac Dre]
Al Boo Boo, shittin', pootin', fartin'
Doper than dope that Whitney be snortin'
P.I., V.I., very important
I'm Mighty Morphin, shakin' law enforcement
Scorchin', torchin', countin' my fortune
Foxy Naut shirt work straight from Nordstrom
Like Ken Norton, I'll punch your lights out
And Dre gon' rap until they turn the lights out
And since I do it, like Timothy blew it
Feds try to take me down like Martha Stewart
I'm knocking Jewish, Chinese and Black bitches
And if they breaded, I even goose fat bitches
I slap bitches, with my left hand
'Cause they goin' to sleep if I use my best hand
Fuck a best man, I ain't gettin' married
I'm a pimp 'til the day my coffin's carried
And I'm buried, cutthoat, you know me
I don't call the cops, people call them on me
I'm on E and all kinds of shit
Drunk at Crump's house bustin' rhymes and shit

[Verse 2: Black Jesus]
Yo
Pill man in the black carpenter
Here we go
I'm in the place, no Thizz face
Off a shot of the Remy and a purple kush eighth
No dates or gettin' on base
Sell a whale some water to steal home plates
So slick, I'm watchin' your bitch
She's watchin' my shirt 'cause it's Gucci on the stitch
I love to get stewie for a bitch
And outside, it's revolutions on the Benz
So they mans hating, but they don't stress or sweat
'Cause they know we pack techs to leave they ass sedated
Thizzlamic, Jesus and Bin Laden
Feds watchin' so we talk in pig Latin
On Metros or hoes in stillettos
Rock stars but we still keep it ghetto
From the whips to stayin' dipped and that bold

[Mac Dre]
Uh uh uh uh
I ain't on thizz tonight (I ain't on thizz tonight)
I'm on yo' bitch tonight (I'm on yo' bitch tonight)
Man, shes tryna leave with me
(Man, she's leavin' with me)

[Verse 3: Mac Dre]
Me and Black Jesus mobbin' with it
Beat the track up like we got a problem with it
She slob and hit it, the dick like a blunt
I'll admit it, the bitch ain't no punk
I'm hella drunk, Thizzle got me hella pumped
Fuckin' with a bitch that I ain't fucked in hella months
Somebody better tell them punks, I ain't for it
Say the wrong thing, mayne, you're paying for it
I can't enjoy it, every time I'm out, y'all
Like three strikes, gotta put niggas out, y'all
About y'all chicks with no cash
I'd rather have one with some and no ass

I ain't on thizz tonight (I ain't on thizz tonight)
I'm on yo' bitch tonight (I'm on yo' bitch tonight)
Man, shes tryna leave with me
(Man, she's leavin' with me)
