[Hook]
I'd rather die like a man than live my life like a bitch
I'd rather be in the pen than walk the streets as a snitch
Playa population is decreasing by millions
So I dedicate this to all the real ones
Real niggas, real niggas
Real niggas, real niggas

[Verse 1]
I got three rules when I hustle and ain't nann one funny
It's like get your money, get your money, and oh yeah, get your money
Can't be no punk and damn sure can't be no ho
I'm like the Grand National, they don't make them like me no mo'
Doper than a joint of that sticky gooey
Hella saucy potna, real ragooey
I pops extra hard 'cause I know talk is cheap
Tell a ho toss it in the air, whatever stay, she keeps
See, I'm about my cheese, I want G's, y'all fucked
Down and dirty, low to the ground like frog nuts
Keep a ho bottom lip hanging like a turtleneck sweater
Love a freaky lizard who can give bomb headers
See my dick stay hard like a cave mans chisel
Waiting for a super bad to come wet my whistle
But my chief goal in life is to gain cash
And that there is more serious than a plane crash

Real niggas, real niggas
Real niggas, real niggas

[Hook]
I'd rather die like a man than live my life like a bitch
I'd rather be in the pen than walk the streets as a snitch
Playa population is decreasing by millions
So I dedicate this to all the real ones

[Verse 2]
I'm on the mic representing that players committee
Letting ya know that some of these niggas need a pair of titties
Never had a player hater bone in my body, never been jealous
Just stubborn, hard-headed and hella rebellious
Fly like Denzel, smooth like Billy Dee
Some ain't feelin' me 'cause they can't really see
I'm saucy 'cause I stay dipped, ho
And still hit the scene and scream "What they hittin' fo'"
Steady havin' cash 'cause I'm down to take a dollar
Quickly pop my collar, and tell that bitch I'll holler
It really ain't hard, it's just the pimpin' in his tongue
That get them bitches sprung, and make them wanna run
And when I say run, I mean perform it to the utmost
Other niggas trip with they dick and wanna fuck hoes
Pimpin's outdated is what them suckas said
But the pimpin ain't dead it'

Real niggas, real niggas
Real niggas, real niggas

[Hook]
I'd rather die like a man than live my life like a bitch
I'd rather be in the pen than walk the streets as a snitch
Playa population is decreasing by millions
So I dedicate this to all the real ones

[Verse 3]
I got the heart of a gangster, mind of a business man, tongue of a pimp
Stupid dumb, all dollars, no cents
Stay perkin', used to be off that 'yac
Now I'm on that gorilla milk or that Yukon Jack
Double R star, three C general
Fortified with this game like vitamins and minerals
Doper than a bottle of that dog food
Y'all thought I was through but now look how I'm comin' at y'all fools
Sportin' 150s, used to fuck with Pumas
Now I'm havin' more money than Brinks and Lunars
Maurice Malone, Mark Buchanon, and Enyce
Cashin' fat checks weekly
Beep me, if you tryin' to et churped at
No paper, you'll get cut likge Elvis Grbac (I heard that)
Punk bitch get stomped out
Triple C ya, Mac Dre, Romped out

Real niggas, real niggas
Real niggas, real niggas

[Hook]
I'd rather die like a man than live my life like a bitch
I'd rather be in the pen than walk the streets as a snitch
Playa population is decreasing by millions
So I dedicate this to all the real ones

Real niggas, real niggas
Real niggas, real niggas
