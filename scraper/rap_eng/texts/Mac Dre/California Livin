[Intro: Mac Dre]
Ah yeah, this is Mac Dre back in your face (California)
I got my homeboy Coolie in the place (California)
Kick back, let us tell you about..

[Verse 1 Mac Dre]
This California lifestyle that I live
Zeus amps, Zap' board, highs and mids
Woofers in the truck straight slammin'
Striking through the neighborhood jammin'
Where you could drop the top, or blow the brains
Hit in the intersection and do some things
Passin' up folks with a gang of yolks
Smooth, thick legs, no pantyhose
Silky perms and dookie braids
Brothers with curls, some with fades
House parties rock, way past three
Players straight sip on Hennessy
High street chasers, Chevy races
Having sex in the strangest places
Nike shoes, Levi's jeans
Triple gold Daytons and straight-laced Zeens
Some on vocals, some only leads
Brothers like me rap to the beat
Dual exhaust, candy paint
Fat bank and gang a dank
Never on time, always late
On the Bay Bridge or the Golden Gate
If you wanna live on the best coast
You better try to move to the West Coast
Where 'Life is Too Short' and 'The Game is Thick'
Home of The Mac and the 'Groupie Ol' Chick'
Where brothers stay on the savage grind
Kick with a freak when they find the time
The C-A-L-I-F-O-R, N-I-A rap superstar
Dose for dose, I love to spit
And for the dank, I love to hit it
Hold it in, so it can choke me
And when I get dank, it will provoke me
To bust a rhyme, through the mike
A West Coast rap, the kind you like
From V-A-double L-E-J-O
Where makin' dope raps is all I know
Wake up in the morning, eat some grits
Hit the studio, make some hits
Now that you've been told about
What you rap fans get sold about
One million copies, or even more
I'm pumpin' dope rhymes to the record store
Yeah fool, you hear me spittin'
Tellin' you about that California livin'

[Hook: Mac Dre & Coolio Da'Unda'Dogg]
(California livin')
(California livin')
Ah yeah, I got my boy Coolie in the house, he's finna bust one
Yeah, what y'all know about C-double O-L-I-O on this microphone? Goes like this...

[Verse 2 Coolio Da'Unda'Dogg]
Kickin' it tuff everyday, tryna make it through
Stackin' a bank, pullin' women and I take it you
Would wanna be down with this California lifestyle
Ruthless as a child, now I'm livin' wild
In the streets of California you better be packin'
And watch your back due to the fact there's jackin'
The wind breeze, blowin' through the trees
And I'm still gettin' tacked at a hundred degrees
Sides so hard on the avenue
From L.A. to the Bay, brothers stay comin' through
In Benzes, Porsches, Fives and things
Dropped Cougs, lit Chevs and whipped up 'stangs
Gold Daytons and Vogues, candy painting the kit
Fifth wheel, gold grill, boy, I'm talk about lit
Some of the baddest females ever seen
Straight California skanks, out for your green
In the Golden State, livin' way too real, fool
And if you soft, you best be cool
To the double R, all my time is givin'
Coolio and Mac Dre, California livin'

(California livin') (Repeat 4X)

[Bridge: Coolio Da'Unda'Dogg]
Ah yeah, Mac Dre, we smooth California livin' on 'em (California livin')
(Mac Dre: What's up my Romp cuddies?)
(California livin')

We shooting to the T-O-P in the 9-O's
(Mac Dre: Livin' that California lifestyle, homeboy)
California livin'

[Mac Dre]
California livin'
Ah yeah, that's dope
Check it out, let's put a little somethin' like this...
Somethin' like this, check it out...1-2-3-(3)

[Verse 3 Mac Dre]
California livin' it up
Girls be givin' it up
Kickin' back on the track with a some Heem in your cup
It's a twelve-month party
So when you see me on stage with Lott and Marty
Get out your seat and feel the beat
And peel a freak and don't stop 'til Cease kills the beat
On the California coast we pop the most
And dose for dose and spit the dope
On the W-e-s-t C-o-a-s-t
It's young Mac Dre from the C-r-e-s-t
Down and dirty, doin' things that only players can do
Straight California livin' is what I'm sayin' to you
Ridin', sidin', whipin', dippin'
24/7, a brotha ain't trippin'
Mac Dre, the one you like to listen to
Nationwide and now I'm fixin' to
Put a little slang in the rap game
And come up strong for The Mac, mayne
("Mac Dre, boy") For The Mac, mayne
("Mac", "Mac") For The Mac, mayne
("Mac Dre, boy")
