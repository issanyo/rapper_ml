You see if your girl starts acting up then you take her friend
I say, Hotel, Motel, Holiday Inn
You see, if your girl starts acting up, then you take her friend

[Verse 1: Mac Dre]
Come on you beezy it's time to split
I'm kinda lit and I'm tryna hit
While you sittin' here wasting time
I got three on deck waiting in line
Plus, Ronald Dregan can't be begging
Let me put the third leg in, before I start wavin'
Be choosy wait for a cutie
Get home he gon' want you to play with that booty
Catch a fruity then catch me at the studie
I'll be gettin' jaw, puffin' on a doobie
With Ruby your ex-best friend
Rubbin' on the hairs of my chinny chin chin

You see if your girl starts acting up then you take her friend
I say, Hotel, Motel, Holiday Inn
You see, if your girl starts acting up, then you take her friend

[Refrain: Mac Dre]
To the beezies in the front, if you like to hump say
"Let me have it, do it daddy stab it"
To the beezies in the back, if you like it from the back say, "Nigga get it, hit it till you split it"
And to the letches on the side, if your coochie tight say, "Don't pound, you won't drown"
And to the beezies over there if you don't care say
"Avior menage a trios"

You see if your girl starts acting up then you take her friend

[Verse 2: Mac Dre]
She's heard stories and lots of rumors
Haters in her head just like some tumors
They told her this, told her that
But when she asked me I said cut the crap
You can miss me with all that talkage
Bitches at me with excessive stalkage
You better get it while I'm full of the heem
Or beezy end up on the shoulda coulda woulda team
Whachu mean, I'm finish-ing, split the scene
My dicks so hard it's gonna split my jeans
You know Treen in that Lexus thing?
She wanna blow and I'm finna let her sing
