[Intro: Mac Dre]
One, two, three
Yeah, this is for all you jazzy cats
A jazzy beat for you jazzy fish
Disco niggas
Catch ya at the club buying drinks all that shit
You know, you know the player type
You gonna love this one

[Verse 1: Mac Dre]
Have you ever been over a bitch house to eat and the food wasn't all that good
But the bitch was hella thick
So you didn't even trip
Had your dick brick, hard as wood
Started beating 'em
Thought about eating 'em
But before you got to it started skeeting 'em
Started treating 'em, buying all kinds of shit
Catch you at the mall you start lying and shit
Well if the shoe fits, oops it's, a song about you
Ralph Ralph pimps and the things y'all do
Fool better take off them blinders
Instead of true show them old rewinders
Recognize game you dick bucket lames
Bitch fuel makes my old school swang
Yeah nigga I don't care
I'm a well done pimp, you still medium rare
Still breathing my air? I suggest you Houdini
And disappear like "I Dream of Jeannie"

[Hook]
Have you ever had a enough to make you break that bread
She lying to your boys about how much you spend
Have you ever had a nigga that was pimp and slick
That broke your pockets, relinquished your whip
Have you ever?
Have you ever girlfriend that you know was [?] catch you cheating [?] you think you got
Have you ever had a nigga that was pimp and slick
That broke your pockets, relinquished your whip
Have you ever?
Bitch have you ever?

[Verse 2: Mac Dre]
The man in the tailpipe, okey doke
They laughing at you dog, like a jokey joke
Pinocchio, that's what they call me
Keep lying to these bitches, and balling
Sometimes you can see yourself falling
No dough ho? Quit calling
They come crawling
Begging for postions
I catch 'em slipping like a fucking transmission
Fuck 'em and diss 'em
Rake 'em and shake 'em
I keep it Cutthoatish, no this ain't no faking
Nathan from Nathan, leaves nathan
Baby got steak 'em, I'm pocket rapin'
Contemplating, a new lick
Bitch got chips she get flicked like Bic
I flip tight shit, nothing but the finest
I'm royalty player, they calling me Your Highness

[Hook]
Have you ever had a enough to make you break that bread
She lying to your boys about how much you spend
Have you ever had a nigga that was pimp and slick
That broke your pockets, relinquished your whip
Have you ever?
Have you ever girlfriend that you know was [?] catch you cheating [?] you think you got
Have you ever had a nigga that was pimp and slick
That broke your pockets, relinquished your whip
Have you ever?
Bitch have you ever?

[Verse 3: Mac Dre]
Mirror, mirror, on your wall
Who be the weakest of them all
You, fool, I thought you knew
You the weakest motherfucker in your whole damn crew
Sucker, sorry motherfucker
Getting old school played like Atari motherfucker
Dumb dumb, where the fuck you come from?
Bro you ain't know? You can get it in lump sums
Why treat? Ain't no need
You can keep the thing pimping, AOB
"You" was written before "you and I"
And they gon' keep pimping even after we die
She wanna keep you shining? Nigga let her
I keep it P.I., have you ever?

[Hook]
Have you ever had a enough to make you break that bread
She lying to your boys about how much you spend
Have you ever had a nigga that was pimp and slick
That broke your pockets, relinquished your whip
Have you ever?
Have you ever girlfriend that you know was [?] catch you cheating [?] you think you got
Have you ever had a nigga that was pimp and slick
That broke your pockets, relinquished your whip
Have you ever?
Bitch have you ever?
