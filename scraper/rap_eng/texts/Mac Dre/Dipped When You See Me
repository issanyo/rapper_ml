[Hook]
I'm dipped when they see me
They don't wanna see me
These niggas wanna be me
These niggas wanna be me
I'm dipped when they see me
They don't wanna see me
These niggas wanna be me
These niggas wanna be me

[Verse 1]
I smoke backwood blunts cuz they the most expensive
Me no work don't touch no nuts and wrenches
You always see me shopping like it's Christmas
I'm always tree shopping like it's Christmas
Miami my witness
Un-flammy relentless
Yes I pimp bitch and no I didn't rent this
I'm showing no interest in them girls thats broke
You need bank and dank for Furl to smoke
Jumbo prawns and australian lobster
I want everything life has to offer
Coppas jealous cuz me an my fellas
Eat fillets no more hot dogs and rellish
Two sets of grills, Two sets of wheels
Whatever I feel I do sex and pills
Coogi in the winter with the matchin' beanie
Eating linguini
I'm dipped when they see me

[Hook]
I'm dipped when they see me
They don't wanna see me
These niggas wanna be me
These niggas wanna be me
I'm dipped when they see me
They don't wanna see me
These niggas wanna be me
These niggas wanna be me

[Verse 2]
It's my turn to live like the Osbournes
Keep rollin baby lets smoke til our eyes burn
I'm not concerned with your petty affairs
You been drivin in that same old Chevy for years
Out with old in with the new
This ain't 2k2 nigga what you gon do
Its 2k3 and it's almost over lemme see
July, August, September, October...yup
Boy you better hurry up flip you a model
And some of that new car smell, that come in a bottle
When I come thru it's like watchin tv
I'm a living video
I'm dipped when they see me

[Hook]
I'm dipped when they see me
They don't wanna see me
These niggas wanna be me
These niggas wanna be me
I'm dipped when they see me
They don't wanna see me
These niggas wanna be me
These niggas wanna be me
