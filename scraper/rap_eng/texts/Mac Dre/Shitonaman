[Verse]
Now what you hear is not a test
I'm a cutthoat nigga, finna rep the West
'Cuz I'm not impressed by you niggas on T.V
Everybody "fa sheezy" and "off the heezy"
I know it ain't easy, rhyme-spillin'
But that's no justification for rhyme-stealin'
Just when I thought it was safe to come tighter
Ooh-fuckin'-wee, another biter
He steal, but still, there's no M.C. coppers
So steal, I drill, will treat niggas like caca
M.D. Iacocca, there's no one doper
Be on bitches' asses like I'm a sofa
But I can't go for all this thievin'
When I start breathin', you punks start leavin'
'Tis the season for me to be stoppin' that
I'm mopping cats, beatin' up copycats

[Hook]
I've heard of starving artists, but this is ridiculous
They bitin' my rhymes like Red Vine licorice
And I'm not diggin' this, it's gettin' outta hand
Any chance I can, I'ma shit on a man

[Verse]
Pull him over, make him take a rap-a-lyzer
He's bitin' my rhymes like appetizers
Put him in jail, throw away the key
He's a two-bit, no-good, sucka M.C
And he's fuckin' with me, M.D. the Great
If I wanted 'em ate, I'd put my rhymes on a plate
For goodness' sake, he's a man - Ricki Lake
Sweet as cake, as soft as they make
The Mac got raps and slaps that knock
But these saps eat 'em up like Pac Man dots
Make him stop, he's killin' me
Gonna make his career disappear like Bill Bellamy's
You don't know, I'm sellin' these, niggas spittin' felonies
Fool, I'm makin' hella Gs, 'n' you bitin' these like celeries
I'm pullin' blankets off the niggas that's fakin' sauce
See you in the streets, then you beat, fool I'm takin' hearts

[Hook]
I've heard of starving artists, but this is ridiculous
They bitin' my rhymes like Red Vine licorice
And I'm not diggin' this, it's gettin' outta hand
Any chance I can, I'ma shit on a man
