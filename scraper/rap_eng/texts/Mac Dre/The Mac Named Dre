To Rap Fans Here In The Vallejo Area, He's Known As Mac Dre...

Lemme Introduce Myself, I'm The Mac
No Just A Mac, In Fact I Wear Many Hats
I'm A Rapper, Capper, Punk Bitch Slapper
Catch With The Farmboys In A Tractor
I'm A Actor, Soon To Be Grammy Nominee
When I'm On E, I Might Do Comedy
Bitches Bombin Me, Boy I'm A Dumb Dancer
7 5 7 0 Cancer
I'm A Rider, Fighter, Crest Sider
Pull An All-Nighter With Mikey On Wires
I'm A Villian And I'm The Owner Of The Building
A Thug, A Drug, To Give Ya That Feelin'
I'm A Producer, Top Notch Gooser
Might Be A Thief, But I'm Not No Booster
Dealt With The Roosters Everyday
Put On My Giggin' Shoes And Do The Mac Dre

[Chorus]

Yeah That's Right I Like To Dance Ho
U Can Catch Me Doin The Furly On The Dance Floor
U Can't Tell Me This Boy Ain't Hot
U Ain't Skate Dem Eights In The Parking Lot
Gas, Break, Dip On Foreign Soil
Blowin 3c Dank, Forever And Loyal
Stompin At The Reigns Tryin To Gain Some Loot
Hop Out The Range With The Range Rover Boots
Boy Dre Teach Game Like Mathematics
Flippin Out On A Bitch Like Acrobatics
Fe Fi Fo Tare, They Call Me Stupid Dumb Cause I Don't Care
Mac Dammit God Dammit, Md
The Nigga From The V With That Mac Family Tree
Ripped, Fucked Up Boy, Not Sober
Rollers Pull Me Over, I'm Not Pullin Over

[Chorus]

High As A Fuckin Fire Escape, Zooted
Had A 8th Of Shrooms But Nigga I Chewed It
Loot It, Enyce Suited
Pack A .44 And Ain't Scared To Shoot It
When I Coug' It, Watch Me Skate
Gold D's On The Biggest Vogues They Make
Give A Bitch A Break, Nope For What?
I'll Be On The Track Posted Up
I'm Yokin' Up
In Somethin New Millinie
I'm High Tech But Old School Like Izrimi
Feelin Cool Off The Remy Yeh Ya Know Me
Benzito 20 Inch Chromies
Neva Lonely I Do It Menage'
And All My Bitches Do What I Say
So If Ya See Me In The Crowd Actin Shadyish
Don't Trip It's Just Mac Drevious
