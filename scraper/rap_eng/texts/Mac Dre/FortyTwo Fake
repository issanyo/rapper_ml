(chorus)
Homegirl said, Mac Dre come through
(She told a nigga to come through)
Let me whoop this puss on you
(You can't whoop that puss on me)
Ain't no ho puss worth my life
(Ain't no puss worth my life)
I ain't know this ho was shiest
(I didn't know the ho was shiest)

(verse 1)
I met her on a Thursday at the DMV
She was payin' registration, I was tryin' to get an I.D
Didn't trip 'til she talked intellectual
And the way she moved was hella sexual
I threw bait, strictly experimental
Dropped my pencil made it look accidental
She bit quick like a big mouth bass
And when she picked up my pencil all I saw was ass
I said what's your name, she said my name's LaShawn
I said excuse my ebonics, but baby you the bomb!
She smiled, told me I was far from ugly
Asked me how I was doin', I said lav lav lovely
Looked at my watch, said my schedule's tight
But if you give up the number I'll call your ass tonight
Right
She was with it and gave up the digits
And when I called later on she said come visit

(chorus)

(verse 2)
Who is it? She said when I knocked on the door
I said it's young MD, oh, you ain't knowin'
Stepped inside and I could tell from a distance
She was burning scented candles and maybe even incense
Boy, I tell ya, she was in the mood
She said, I hope you're hungry 'cause I cooked up some food
She lit the fireplace, threw on a love ballad
Before the main course we ate shrimps and salad
We talked for a while and drank Zinfandel
She had ass like ten games of big pin the tail
On the donkey
Chocolate, opposite from honky
All I can think about is hittin' that monkey

(chorus)

(verse 3)
She was diggin' your folks, boy I could tell
How she served fat steaks and big lobster tail
On the first visit, everything exquisite
The door bell rang, she didn't ask who is it
She must've knew dude, 'cause she gave him some cash
He kicked down a twomp sack and a fat gram of hash
We smashed, we turned joints to doobies
She eightysixed the music and pulled out three movies
Mahogany, The Mack, Baby Got Back
She said, I'll be right back, roll the rest of that sack
I rolled the weed up, then I kicked my feet up
Then two niggas came in with masks on, G'd up
The plot thickens, I'm slippin' like a muthafucka
Mopped and chopped and gettin' treated like a sucka
Five minutes ago, I was finna fuck great
But now I'm gagged up, wrapped in duct tape
They choked me, broke me, and dropped me off on the bridge
And all I can think about was killin' that bitch
My worst mistake, fuckin' with a snake
How a playa gonna fall for that Fortytwo Fake?
That Fortytwo Fake

(chorus to end)
