Rain on ‘em

[Ferg:]
…Or the other side of town…

It’s rainin’ game in Northern California
I’ll see you when I get there

[Verse 1]
Hopped out the shower, turned on the beat and started jammin’
Put on my Pelle Pelle shirt made by Marc Buchanan
I’m slammin’ Sugawolf ‘cause he be a straight hog
Put on my Abercrombie coat to cope with the Bay fog
I stay sharp, my job is peelin’ them top notches
I got beyotches and Mac Driggedy stays cautious
Gotta watch they every move ‘cause dude I gots to warn ya
It’s rainin’ game up in Northern California
I’m extra flossy and saucy so I pops collars
Clocks dollars, and boy, I squats Impalas
Pullin’ up on bitches, I’m off the hinges, I likes to clown
Better get your sponge, it’s comin’ down in the town

[Chorus: Ferg]
It’s rainin’ game in Northern California
They tell me…
It’s rainin’ game in Northern California
They tell me…
It’s rainin’ game in Northern California
They tell me…
It’s rainin’ game in Northern California
Ooh ooh

[Verse 2]
We got that sauce like boss playas, we floss the cleanest
Pushin’ them Daytons, and some of us roll on Zeniths
Straight lace triple gold, it’s difficult not to jock
She’s lookin’ famous, so you know I gots to knock
Gotta peep the scene though ‘cause with these hoes you might get played
By one of them broads wearing weaves, bobs or braids
It’s rainin’ game in the North, dude, it’s so flooded
And all this game that we pour, ooh, is cold-blooded
But they love it, and always want more of it
Hear me servin’ it on tape and then they can’t wait to dub it
I shove up in your ear like a Q-Tip then you get to geekin’
For the words I’m speakin’ you tweakin’ for the game I’m leakin’, boy

[Chorus: Ferg]
It’s rainin’ game in Northern California
That’s what they tell me
It’s rainin’ game in Northern California
They tell me...
It’s rainin’ game in Northern California
They tell me...
It’s rainin’ game in Northern California

(Khayree: Ferg, sing a little something)

[Ferg:]
Well, it may be cold on the East Coast or the other side of town
But this is the Bay
Ooh ooh

[Verse 3]
You might get hurt when you in that Bay, so my trigger finger stays itchy
I love to perk when I’m around the way and I’m a Seasoned Veteran like Richie
Rich, of course, and I spit with force, and I’m sho’ nuff full of that game
And that North Pole, Valley Jo, Country Club Crest I claim
See, in the Bay, we like to ball, and players like me stand tall
You might catch me on I-80 in the Bay on my way to the mall
‘Cause I love to shop, chase cot, game more potent than a base rock
Love to side when I ride but the tires won’t slide if it ain’t hot
So I stay seated in a Chevy that’s heated and really there’s no trip needed
Although you do look good, girl I never would eat it but will beat it
Conceited, yes, and need a fresh top notch on my team
So trip, stack and then kicks back, and listen to the homeboy sing

[Chorus: Ferg]
It’s rainin’ game in Northern California
I wanna be right there with you
It’s rainin’ game in Northern California
There’s nothin’ else I’d rather do
It’s rainin’ game in Northern California
That’s what they tell me
It’s rainin’ game in Northern California
Ooh ooh, ooh ooh

(MD: What they tell you?)
Well, it may be cold on the East Coast or the other side of town
But this is the Bay
(MD: This is the Bay, this is the Bay, this is the Bay, Mac Dre)
Well, it may be cold on the East Coast or the other side of town
But this is the Bay
(MD: Khayree, show ‘em what you do on that guitar, boy)
Ooh ooh

[Khayree guitar solo]

I’ll see you when I get there
This is the Bay, the Bay, the Bay, the Bay
The Bay, the Bay, the Bay, the Bay
This is the Bay

It’s raining game in Northern California
I wanna be right there with you
It’s raining game in Northern California
There’s nothing else I’d rather do

It’s that Bay, y’all, it’s that Bay, y’all
It’s that Bay, y’all, Bay, y’all, Bay, y’all
It’s that Bay, y’all, it’s that Bay, y’all
It’s that Bay, y’all, Bay, y’all, Bay, y’all

This is the Bay

(MD: Better get your sponge…Mac Dre)
