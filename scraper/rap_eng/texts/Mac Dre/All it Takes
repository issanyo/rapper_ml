[Hook 2x]
A little bit of game is all it takes
A little bit of game goes a long, long way

[Verse 1]
Cuddie I don’t sleep much, cause when I close my eyes
I hear cries from my partners who lost they lives
Visions of bloody brutality's reality
Got to stay focused and hope it don’t affect my salary
Them calories, they keep my pockets fat, I got to stack a grip
Try not to trip, and keep them gold diggers off my dick
I'm getting' sick cause I drink 24-7
The way I’m living' now, if I die, there’s no heaven
Got to help my partner’s in the pen cause they living broke
This ain’t no joke, on parole and I can’t smoke
No sticky indo, roll down the window
Cause if I breathe the tac is back light like Nintendo
Got to play the game like a professional
If you ain’t having money I got to let you go
I need to let you know the rules before you infiltrate
Rule number one partner, never should you pimpatrate
I spit this pimping straight - uncut, no additives
Just nouns and adjectives, how mad you get don’t matter bitch
I'm a player, so I serve the game
Maintain, campaign, and have thangs

[Hook 2x]

[Verse 2]
Back in '92 I was drowned in them big cases
But now it’s '97 and I’m counting them big faces
I switched places with them sardines and spreads
The tiger prawns, fillet mignon, and garlic bread
A hard head, big heart, and gorilla nuts
Got me mobbing' thru the bay like I don’t give a fuck
I'm whipped, equipped, and stay dipped in butter sauce
Peel if she’s real, no skrill, I cut her off
Cause fine ass bitches with the empty bank books
Is worse than them ugly muthafuckas who can’t cook
My game cooked for five years in the feds
Now it’s time for these game hungry niggas to get fed
I get bread, so them suckers down me
Smile in my face but clown me when they not around me
Talk down on my every move, but I couldn’t give a damn
Playas do what they want, and suckers do what they can

[Hook 2x]

[Verse 3]
7-5-70, my D-O-B
And I’ve been breaking' hoes since '83
Money makers manual, handle my business discreetly
Don’t give my home phone number out, beep me
Cause ain't no telling' who be telling', or who they tell
And plus I heard that they be selling' kinfolk the yayo
Boy get your mail, don’t act like your little sister
If you lacking' in this macking boy, I bet you fist her
Get some get right as I come tight to this doo doo dumb
Track, that cat k-lou, knew how to come
With mac dre, that 3 c veteran
More game than march madness, and dope as Excedrin
Hit big licks, wouldn’t pull no small capers
I'm a be a dog and stay up like wall paper
Look at these broke bitches like they stank
Collect my bank and stay sharp as a shank
