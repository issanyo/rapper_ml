[Intro: Mac Dre]
Yeah, yeah
That’s lav, mayne, real lav
That’s real, so right
Mac Dre and Cisco
Here to let a bitch know

[Verse 1]
[Mac Dre]
I’m at the bar, jibbin’ at hoes, poppin’ it
They eatin’ it, and spillin’ it, they moppin’ it
Lovin’ your cousin because I’m a sav
Gone off them thizzles, ‘bout one and a half
It’ s me and Cisco, we in Frisco
And I’m bustin’ at bitches like a pistol
It’s so crazy up in here
I’m tryna shake a square beezy, ‘cause she…

[Don Cisco]
She ain’t nothin’ but some pimp’s hoe
Mac Dre and Cisco X game tremendo, blowin’ on indo
Break all nymphos, straight or lesbo
Lesbhonest with the ill na na wanna menage a trois
With me and the potna, freaky like Madonna
Biting on my heels like a piranha
That’s club drama, I love Henny and pina coladas
Swing a big stick, get you wide open like a piñata

[Hook 4X: Mac Dre]
It’s too many hoes up in here
For a pimp not to get chose up in here

[Verse 2]
[Mac Dre]
Bounce, rock, perk wit’ me
Put the dank in the blunt, baby, work wit’ me
I’m going nutso, wit’ my cutthroat
Young Suavearachi, what’s up, loc?
We doin’ big thangs, ‘cause we big people
On damn near drugs like it’s legal
I couldn’t feel no lav-er, or feel no sav-er
She’s looking kinda famous, cuddie, go grab her

[Don Cisco]
Now when I call, you respond no matter what the weather
Come through in your thong, nobody does it better
Than I do, but you already knew that, boo
Nobody gives head better than you
If the pussy’s mine, let me cool, just keep it on ice
(see, if I thrust ya once, hoe, I’mma thrust ya twice)
See I’m a hustler, so it’s a must I get paid
Customary like Hawaii, touch down and get laid/lei’d

[Hook 4X: Mac Dre]
It’s too many hoes up in here
For a pimp not to get chose up in here

[Verse 3]
[Don Cisco]
I’m comin’, baby, like the big brown kahuna
Plenty of fish in the sea, plenty more hoes around the corner
If you want, I’ll beat him down, show you how to pop your collar
Every time I’m back in town I’mma give you a holler
Maybe we could hookup at the Holiday Inn
You could come through, baby, and bring your friends
See, me and Mac Dre’s in town, captain, hide your hoes
‘Cause you know what happens if I get chose

[Mac Dre]
I go buck looie when I let loose
Playin’ “Hutch, Hutch, Choose” like “Duck, Duck, Goose”
Oh boy, it’s nothin’, I mack for sport
Runnin’ full press game up and down the court
Mac Drevious the craziest cutthoat, fool
Maybe it’s the gravy in my cutthoat soup
That make it so saucy, keepin’ it so flossy
Do it big, Bay style, real bossy

[Hook 4X: Mac Dre]
It’s too many hoes up in here
For a pimp not to get chose up in here

[Verse 4: Don Cisco]
Now when we run outta looie, we put doobies in a crutch too
Hits’ll make your chest bust, sticky to the touch
If I see a hutch, with some cheeseballs in a clutch
Like a pimp, dawg, I pick it up, pick it up
Give it up, turn it loose, silly duck, it’s no use
You fuckin’ with the golden goose
Hawkeye surrounded by pigeons holding on a deuce-deuce
The reason why all the chickenheads flew the coop
With the loot, execute like a pimp, I thought you knew
Mac Dre said they eat Fish Head Stew
