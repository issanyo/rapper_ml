The Genie of the Lamp
(Who is it?)
It's the Genie of the Lamp
The Genie of the Lamp
(Who is it?)
The Genie of the Lamp
It's the Genie of the Lamp

[Verse 1]
Multi-cultural, hot vocals
Everywhere I go I get love from the locals
They buy it, slump it, knock it, bump it
My voice is an instrument, I'm kinda like a trumpet
They tryin' to figure out my estimated wealth
I'm a hot item, they can't keep me on the shelf
Stores restock me, whores be jocking
Benihana waitresses pour me sake
Catch Papi sloppy freakin' Puerto Ricans
And when it's late I sling eighths at Beacon
Ain't no sleepin', nigga I'm the mob
And nigga being the mob is a full time job
Ask Hob in a Celsior
Mob niggas live a little healthier
A little wealthier without helping her
But I'm a pimp, so I'm gon' get help from her
We on "The Wharf" at Joe's, gettin' our crab on
Lobster tails with the Alaskan add-ons

Ménage à trois, (I’m doin' it bitch)
Ênfase na (you can’t ruin it bitch)
Ênfase na (she takin' off tonight)
Ménage à trois (for a Boston flight)
Ménage à trois, (I’m doin' it bitch)
Ênfase na (you can’t ruin it bitch)
Ênfase na (she takin' off tonight)
Ménage à trois (for a Boston flight)

[Verse 2]
I went from sleepin' in cars to livin' residential
A street star, you can check my credentials
Ronald Dregan, livin' presidential
Expensive utensils, not the essentials
I don't piss on fools, nigga I'll boo boo
The genie of the lamp, Muhammad Al Boo Boo
The gun, it will shoot, I run and will scoot
Fuck twos and fews, I'm comin' for real loot
I’ll pill you, tell a bitch what she'll do
Enough bread to make your man switch teams and kill you
And I don't feel you, you’re really farfetched
I'm playin' for the A's, is you workin' for the Mets?
Place your bets, the odds are against me
It's Russian roulette, I got the mob niggas with me

Ménage à trois, (I’m doin' it bitch)
Ênfase na (you can’t ruin it bitch)
Ênfase na (she takin' off tonight)
Ménage à trois (for a Boston flight)
Ménage à trois, (I’m doin' it bitch)
Ênfase na (you can’t ruin it bitch)
Ênfase na (she takin' off tonight)
Ménage à trois (for a Boston flight)
