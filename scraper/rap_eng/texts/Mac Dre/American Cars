[Hook 2X: Mac Dre]
Ford, Chev, whatever ya got
It don't mean shit if the shit ain't hot
Lincoln, Caddy, whatever ya got
Push it, man, don't be scared to squat

[Verse 1: Andre Nickatina]
Quick fast in a hurry
Squat, bounce. drop dirty
Cocaine white tiger white walls
HIt the freeway hard at night y'all
Put the keys right there, I'm ready to drive
Like a eagle at 1,2 I'm ready to fly
Pager going off, the cell phone's ringin'
Al Green's playin' and I keep singin'
Jeans creased up with the beat up
Now I'm about to go pick this little freak up
Blow L's, make mail, ponytails
Had to compliment her on her French done nails
Varoom, motherfucker, boom boom
A whole block of green lights, freak zoom zoom
Mario Andretti with Blowjob Betty
Pedal to the metal when you're ridin' with the devil
Did just that at In-n-Out Burger
No pickles, no onions, no playin'
Check this out, no delayin'
Did a donut right is what I'm sayin' SHIT
Police came, I was on the streets
Smokin' more weed, bumpin' more beats
Puttin' more words in the ear of this freak
Cadillac girl, somethin' I'mma keep, Seville

[Hook: Mac Dre + (Andre Nickatina)]
Ford, Chev, whatever ya got
It don't mean shit if the shit ain't hot
(I roll so outta control, windows on tint so I'm not exposed)
Lincoln, Caddy, whatever ya got
Push it, man, don't be scared to squat
(At the Honeycomb Hideout, I side out
Fish, tell 'em where the hook, check it on the ride out)
Ford, Chev, whatever ya got
It don't mean shit if the shit ain't hot
(Rally stripes with them D-boy pipes
Make you think about strikin' when they flash them lights)
Lincoln, Caddy, whatever ya got
Push it, man, don't be scared to squat
(Such a fine ride with the perfect paint
At the red light and you can't wait to race)

[Verse 2: Mac Dre]
Cam, lifters, MSD shifter
351 make the old school swifter
Rack on the trunk, slap in the trunk
Fat four-four in my lap for the funk
Talkin' to a beezy on the phone but can't hear her
Turned down the hump, so I can hear clearer
I hear sirens get nearer
Red and blue lights in my rearview mirror
Pull over, nope nope
With a car full of smoke and trunk full of dope
I hit the gasser, go faster
All you hear is dual exhaust, flowmaster
On a chase, I take 'em, then shake 'em
A real Cutthoat nigga, ain't no fakin'
I shoot, ain't scared to scoot
And shake the one time on a hot pursuit

[Hook: Mac Dre + (Andre Nickatina)]
Ford, Chev, whatever ya got
It don't mean shit if the shit ain't hot
(I roll so outta control, windows on tint so I'm not exposed)
Lincoln, Caddy, whatever ya got
Push it, man, don't be scared to squat
(At the Honeycomb Hideout, I side out
Fish, tell 'em where the hook, check it on the ride out)
Ford, Chev, whatever ya got
It don't mean shit if the shit ain't hot
(Rally stripes with them D-boy pipes
Make you think about strikin' when they flash them lights)
Lincoln, Caddy, whatever ya got
Push it, man, don't be scared to squat
(Such a fine ride with the perfect paint
At the red light and you can't wait to race)

[Mac Dre]
Ford, Chev, whatever ya got
It don't mean shit if the shit ain't hot
Lincoln, Caddy, whatever ya got
Push it, man, don't be scared to squat

[Outro: Mac Dre]
Yeah, I wouldn't give a fuck what you're drivin', mayne
Be it Lincoln, be it Caddy, be it Ford, be it Chevy
Nigga, get further, mayne
Don't sit there and get caught by the police, mayne
I'mma tell ya, mayne, it's nothin'
Burn rubber all down the block...and don't stop
Ya know
