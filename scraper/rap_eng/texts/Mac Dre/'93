[Intro]
’92, nuthin’ nice, I thought you knew
Brothers gettin’ smoked, it ain’t no joke
But I got a little something for that
Check it out “That’s right”
1, 2 “Mac muthafuckin’ Dre”

[Verse 1]
Murder rate is up but still don’t give a fuck
It’s all about stacks and making a fast buck
Black man, often common reality
Cops getting away with police brutality
Everywhere I go it’s the same old thing
Brothers on the block slanging with cocaine
Can’t get a job ‘cause the boss is prejudiced
How come everybody is so damn negative?
Jail cells packed to full capacity
Punk police keep steady harassing me
Babies having babies addicted to blow
Brothers started jacking for shit, that’s low
Kids steady taking big guns to school
Thinking that shit is all fun and cool
But kids keep dying from ruthless crimes
I guess we’re just going through ruthless times
’92 really wasn’t shit to me
I wonder what happens in ‘93

[Hook]
“Yeah though” ’93…I wonder what happens in ‘93
“Yeah though” ’93…I wonder what happens in ‘93
“Yeah though” ’93…I wonder what happens in ‘93
“Yeah though” “Getting crazy”…I wonder what happens in ‘93

[Verse 2]
’92, year of the homicide
Fathers, daughters, sons and mamas died
9 millimeters became essential
And learning how to use them was fundamental
Brothers sold rock on the block they slayed hard
One-way ticket for a trip to the graveyard
Muthafuckas have no time to fight
Shoot ‘em up quick sideways to the next light
Brothers nowadays have so much anger
Mama’s little boy is now a stranger
Never woulda thought he’d be a ruthless villain
Killing muthafuckas, straight robbin’ and stealin’
But that’s how it goes, and all he knows
Is talk these hoes up out they clothes
It’s all about green, money reigns supreme
Young black brothas try to chase that dream
Living all in tidy bowl, no one excited though
That’s the way it is, it just ain’t right though
’92 really wasn’t shit to me
I wonder what happens in ‘93

[Hook]
“Yeah though” ’93…’93…I wonder what happens in ‘93
“Yeah though” ’93…’93…I wonder what happens in ‘93
“Yeah though” ’93…What’s gonna happen in ’93?
“Yeah though” “Getting crazy”…I wonder what happens in ‘93

[Verse 3]
What’s gonna happen in ’93?
Another white president lying to me
Talking some shit about a minimum wage
Fuck that shit, I’m finna get paid
Slangin’ this dope through a microphone
And never would I ever leave the mic alone
If I wasn’t rappin’, what would probably happen
I’d be cuttin’ down ounces, straight stackin’
It’s a damn shame but it’s oh so real
But instead of selling coke, dope raps I deal
But for most young brothers it ain’t that easy
Times are rough, and life is sleazy
Living on the track tryin’ to make that mail
Shooting them dice waiting for that sale
In ’93, will things get worse?
How many brothers will ride in a hearse?
’92 really wasn’t shit to me
I hope it gets better in ‘93

[Hook]
“Mac Dre” ’93…I hope it gets better in ‘93
“Mac Dre” ’93…’93…Will things get better in ’93?
“Mac Dre” ’93…’93…I hope it gets better in ‘93
“Mac Dre” ‘93…I hope it gets better in ‘93

“Yeah though”
Yeah, Mac Dre, locked down in ‘92
But I’ll be free in ’93, yeah
In the Fresno jail, I ain’t stressin’
Straight progressin’, you know “Yeah though”
Brothers gotta get their game tight…

[Khayree]
Do you wanna come up in ’93?
Gotta stack a big bank ‘cause you want a big thing
Brothers ain’t  jacking every day and every night
‘Cause a muthafucka just wanna live life right
Don’t trip, mayne; young brother, don’t trip, mayne
Don’t trip, mayne; young brother, don’t trip, mayne
I wanna say one more thing before I go
“Getting crazy” “Crestside”
Yeah, much love, mayne; I send much love, mayne
“Much love” I’ll work on that; I’ll work on that
Young and black

And the beat don’t stop (Beat don’t stop)
(Repeated until end)
