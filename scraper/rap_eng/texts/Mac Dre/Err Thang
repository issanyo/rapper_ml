[Chorus 2X]
I play err thang—video games to pretty hoes, mayne
Err thang from fly fishin’ to badminton
Do err thang from surfin' to skiin'
Stay shittin', not peein', in somethin’ European
Err thang
Err thang

[Verse 1: Mac Dre]
I'm the only nigga you know that walked before he crawled
So give it to me you beezie, I want it all
All of it (all of it), you know, err thang
I need it before I start hittin' that hairy thang
This is a game, and I'm in it
Dick so good I charge by the minute
Is you lost? It cost to be around the boss
I play bitches better than Tiger play golf
An all-star, never drive a small car
Davins on mine, shittin' on y'all car
Err body know Gotti roll the a big body
And err body know I turn out the party
Catch me at Vlade's, in the Tunnel
Drinkin' like a fish, mouth like a funnel
On err thang—thizz, weed and drank
And whatever else I wanna put in my tank
What y'all think, I was scary, mayne?
I’m Dre Ghost (Dre Ghost), I do err thang

[Chorus (PSD)]
I play err thang—video games to pretty hoes, mayne
Err thang from fly fishin’ to badminton
Do err thang from surfin' to skiin'
Stay shittin', not peein', in somethin’ European
Err thang (I slide up, it’s paid for)
Err thang (And you know it’s all on a hoe)

[Verse 2: PSD]
I slide up in a German shepherd, minked out leopard
Tailored down suits with my gators checkered
I’m a ghetto millionaire, hoes pay me from everywhere
I send them to the track, they bring me, money back
State to state, Tony is great, money is made
Catch me in Miami with Miami movin' weight
I came in the door, haters on the floor
Pocket full of money, my bitch is ready to hoe
Bring daddy dough is all they wanna do
Why fuck the bitch when you'll pay her to fuck you
Pawns slide through, I'm with a chosen few
Fifth’d up, feeling like vapors, I’m chipped up
Pull the 6 up, got ‘em lookin' like ‘whoa’
‘Is it paid for?’ It's all on a hoe

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Mac Dre]
Give me a OPD with err thang on it (all of it)
That’s right, Alice, you know how I want it
Every lady in my palace is named Alice
Dre run things like J.R. from Dallas
Or Blake Carrington or Victor Newman
If another nigga bite me again I’m suing
Who in, the hell, didn't know
I do err thang err where I go
Man, your game is lame, it's very plain
You need to quit rappin’, I put that on err thang
I need some Mary Jane and some Champelli, mayne
A smelly thang
Joe Pelly is my relly, mayne
Mac Dregos got hoes in Barbados
And like Suga Wolf, I gather up stables
Record labels want me to sign
But I’m signed to Thizz and Thizz is mine!
