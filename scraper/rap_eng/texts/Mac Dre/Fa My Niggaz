[Intro: Mac Dre]
This is for my niggas
Strictly for my niggas
Get back you beezy this is for my neezys

[Verse 1: Mac Dre]
My niggas will steal the message and kill the messenger
Run in the store come out with the cash register
Break the law break your broads break your jaw shake the raw don't make a nigga make the call
It's nathan y'all we in the thug nation y'all
We steal niggas in the club thugs face and all
Taking off niggas getting rooked on
While some niggas in the hood getting they joog on
They specialize in cop evasion
Home invasion and pimping Caucasians
Fuck the litigation trial and court
We keep them high speed chasing that super sport
We off that Richter hella ripped tho
We'll chip you watch the weed will stiff ya
City slickers
Them Cutthoat Committee niggas
Knuckleheads that will get them up with any nigga

[Hook: Bullet Proof]
Go to sleep put your face to my knuckles
I'm swinging bouts catching niggas with the buckle
Buckle up and move safely cause I'm hot headed
With no patience stand ready to scrape shit
Go ahead call me Neo from The Matrix
I bust heads and keep them running like a Asics
I'm a original I lay it, you trace it
It's pitiful cause most of y'all stuck to the basics

[Verse 2: Mac Dre]
I got nappy dread locks and a rude mouth
Bitch talk shit bitch get chewed out
Don't get to loud start start causing a ruckus
My niggas won't like it and they kill mother fuckers
We some real mother fuckers born and sworn
Into a game to most is foreign
It's never boring no time for snoring
It's money in the streets and i can't be ignorin'
We war torn hittin' every turf
Setting up shop seeing what its worth, nigga
Since birth we was taught to get it
Stay with it saucy-fitted, quit it
Nigga cut the crap
Niggas ain't playing they busting caps
While you busting raps playing your heart out
Niggas is plotting on taking your heart out

[Hook:  Bullet Proof]
Go to sleep put your face to my knuckles
I'm swinging bouts catching niggas with the buckle
Buckle up and move safely cause I'm hot headed
With no patience stand ready to scrape shit
Go ahead call me Neo from The Matrix
I bust heads and keep them running like a Asics
I'm a original I lay it, you trace it
It's pitiful cause most of y'all stuck to the basics

[Verse 3: Mac Dre]
The Mac is on the track jumping over hurdles
Laughing these bitch niggas
Handing them girdles
Them slow turtles can't catch the murdle
The S5 dick spread you too fertile
The popcorn kernel at the bottom of the bag
I'ma burnin' inferno and I'm thugging in the lab
We can nug in the back or we can take it to the street
Me heaters like me dick I make it skeet
I take and cheat lie rob and steal
Do a bad drug deal that make blood spill
I'm from Grudgeville niggas ain't forgettin'
We eating everyday like its Thanksgiving
Its California livin' we swimming in the Bay
An hour from L.A on S.W.A
They loving Dre hella hooting and hollering
They ain't hugging Dre they buking and swallowing

[Hook:  Bullet Proof]
Go to sleep put your face to my knuckles
I'm swinging bouts catching niggas with the buckle
Buckle up and move safely cause I'm hot headed
With no patience stand ready to scrape shit
Go ahead call me Neo from The Matrix
I bust heads and keep them running like a Asics
I'm a original I lay it, you trace it
It's pitiful cause most of y'all stuck to the basics
