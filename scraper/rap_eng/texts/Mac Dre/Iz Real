[Messy Marv]
Believe all what you see and 50 percent of what you hear on tapes
'Cause half of these rap niggas is fake
Cousin, we bang hard, even behind bars
With C.O.'s and guards, my niggas run the yard
They knockin' Messy Marv, 'cause the dope so clean
415, BGF, Crips, and 14
I'm a top hat rap cat, you niggas locals
And couldn't recognize the game with bifocals
I'm big shit, operation bi-coastal
And mob loc up when we suppose to
Keep a bitch broke, keep a keep a bitch broke
Keep a bitch broke, keep a keep a bitch broke
Ain't no jobs for a nigga, we forced to sale dope
And ride all gold with not chrome on one spoke
I hit yo' house party jeweled and bandana'd
I'm from the Cartel, the real Tony Montana's
We put drums and bananas on iz reals
Hood nut niggas thizzin' on E pills
I could see the nigga had bitch in him
So I let the 50 cal blaow get with him
I keep it real, I don't rap about fake shit
It's California, mayne, we draw down and take shit
I keep it real, I don't rap about fake shit
This California, mayne, we draw down and take shit

[Mac Dre]
Hop out the Cougnut, change over, to the Range Rover
Mouth full of diamonds, spitting, like a flame thrower
I ain't sober, I'm ripped, tilted
Had a fifth of Remy, but nigga, I killed it
Damn near spilled it on my Enyce clothes
It's the Cutthoat Committee, punk, we play hoes
20-inch'd up, wood grain, leather
Strap, riding, with an Eagle from the Desert
It's the Mac almighty, Andre Hicks
And ain't a punk rock bitch that I can't get
And nigga, I can't trip off nathan but my scrill
And that iz real like a thizz pill
And I will kill, put one to yo' liver
I'm a pimp nigga taking everything you give her
Flossing while them suckas is starving
Eating crab at Crustaceans with my nigga Messy Marvin
