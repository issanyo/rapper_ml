[Intro: Yukmouth]
Little ones, yes
Ya nigga Yukmouth in this bitch, what!
Yeah, FM Blue in this bitch, what!
Yeah, Fast Life in this bitch, what!
Real Oakland niggas, yeah
East Oakland niggas, bitch, yeah
This when the real meet the real ya nigga, yeah
Uh, yeah

[Verse 1: Yukmouth]
Yuk ain’t Georgy Porgy but the bitches adore me
So many condoms on the floor you think it’s an orgy
So many choppas in the car you think it’s an Army
Or a Navy the way blaze K’s at them shady niggas
So many throwbacks you think it’s the ‘80s
The coupes and trucks back-to-back, Lincoln, Mercedes
Fucked so many bottom broads you think it’s your lady
Or your bitch, niggas crazy, she drinkin’ my babies, ugh
So much ice in the blue chain you probably think it’s Wu-Tang
Sah-dah-tay every day like it’s Pootie Tang
Yuk and FM Blue, mayne, team up like the Kings in a hoop game
Alley-oop to your nigga with the two chains
And watch me shoot flame, bank shot off the glass, right?
Smoke-a-Lot and Fast Life, nigga, what your cash like?
Step it up, I’m like Scrooge McDuck
In a coupe gettin’ sucked with the Uz’ to bust, I’m too much

[Chorus 2X: Yukmouth]
4 Much, in a Chevy swingin’ donuts ‘til the cops show up
You know I’m too much, 4 Much, in the kitchen cookin’ dope up
‘Til the cops the show up, niggas know I’m too much

[Verse 2: Mac Dre]
I’ll tell you one thing, I run tings like Papa Smurf
No matter where I’m at, the Earth is my turf
Run on niggas like they AstroTurf
‘Where am I? What happened?’ is what you ask your nurse
See, I’m blastin’ first, after that, we can talk
1-87s, 2-11s, assaults
Never let ‘em see me sweat, never show my faults
I’m strict and I stick to the script I was taught
Everything I ever bought was all on her
Everything I ever want is all on her
I’m so fly, your guy, the one you elected
And them goons bow down, they gots to respect
I’m the one you selected,  but not what you expected
I’m game-infected and I bring it hectic
Done broke a gang of records, I’m a Hall of Famer
I’m the hardest artist like Picasso the painter
