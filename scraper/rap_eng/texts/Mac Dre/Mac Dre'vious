Where you going Mac Dre'vious?
What is his name? What is his other name though?
The guru of pimpin'..  Mac guru mo' gimpin'
The guru of pimpin'

[Mac Dre]
As I walk through the crowd I could hear necks snappin'
I here voices saying "Oh gee, He rappin'?"
Its mackin' funky fresh in the flesh
You might see me in the traffic rolling SS
Or GS, Excursion or Navi
Or maybe Range Rovin' perkin' with some babby
It's daddy recruitin' hoes that love goosin'
Robbin' and shootin', indulge in prostitution
I'm goosin', juicin' and game inducin'
To claim restitution, I ain't got no suits and
Quit mother goosin' this ain't no story
I'm a cutthoat pimp fighting for my glory
It's me, MD, bitch follow me
And we can get paid for dick swallowing
Bada bing bada bang, it really ain't no thang
I'm deep in this game, and you a freak in this game
So we can exchange the pimpin' for the ho-in
Baby you ain't knowin' the top is where I'm goin'
There's no one that could ever do it better
I gets my cheddar, mozzarella or whatever...
Or whatever, the earth is my turf
Where I roam is my home, cutthoat rolling stone
Catch me with ladies in a fuckin' Mercedes
Countin' fetti while I'm sucking on tetties
I dress eighties, keep it old schoolish
So shut the fuck up nigga and let me do this
Who this? Oh, it's you
You got [?] for me, baby, bring it with that other two
I'm blinging and because of you, I live lav'
Everything I want is everything I have
It's the lifestyle of the sav' and lavish
Girl, money makes the world twirl, I'm having cabbage
Kick back relax let me bust one mo'
I'm a gun slinger partner I do it gung ho
Got a dumb flow, keep more than one ho
It's Mr. Hicks in the mix nigga hear me in the gumbo
Run ho, you're square as a box
And I'm a thug, the kind of guy that'll swear to your pops
I fled from the cops, and sold rocks in my past time
And jack fools straight faced with no mask I'm
A cutthoat, I don't have to prove it to ya
I'll leave ya ass stuck with buckshots movin' through ya
I'mma do ya like you never been done
Have you screaming "I need bullets, hurry up, run"
