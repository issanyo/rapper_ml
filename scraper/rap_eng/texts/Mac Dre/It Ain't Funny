[Chorus: Mac Dre]
Ha ha, it ain’t funny but the money keep us laughin’, y’all
The game is rough like blacktop basketball
Weak niggas fall, you got to keep mashin’, dog
And do it movin’ if you got the people after y’all

[Verse 1: Rydah J. Klyde]
It’s the Rydah, the real one
Ya nig, I might steal one
Shots echo through the ghetto
Rip through your buildin’
Just missed your children
Right above the crib
Though you wasn’t so lucky
Somebody love the kid
You shoulda ran and hid, the line had been crossed
The 4-5 and the choppa after the nines had got tossed
Somebody gotta die, if I go, you gots to go
My yayo’s movin’ slow, my K need ammo
It’s the life, I live it, my right to spit it is evident
Bustin’ my gun and it wasn’t for dead presidents
I’m tryna live, fuck all forensics, no evidence
Stalk out his house, we bring the drama to your residence
Don’t be alarmed, bitch, it’s just the M-O-B
Rules to this game we play, it’s either him or me
I gotta get him, shots hit him up every direction
From the Bay to P.O., this how we represent the section

[Chorus]

Can ya, can ya move it do it? (Move it do it)
You better (Do it movin’)
Let’s move it do it (You better)

[Verse 2: Mac Dre]
I work hard for the money but I never had a job
I run with the mob, deal, steal and rob
Got chicks with tricks on the World Wide Web
Snow bunnies get money, white girls I said
Fight Furl, ya dead, pick, ya get whacked
My little niggas is mainey, they don’t know how to act
They up at 7 with Cobra and Elevens
In Friendship buildin’ chillin’ more than reverend
Waitin’ for the OK call from up top
Been doin’ it since niggas was doin’ the Uprock
Buckshots, itchy itchy, blah blah, heart stops
Head popped, ooh, some nigga got dropped
Got knocked, got popped, did Fed time
K.O. with one blow, lights out, it’s bedtime
Wake up, make up, with the game, it’s bread time
A killer on the news and front-page headlines
