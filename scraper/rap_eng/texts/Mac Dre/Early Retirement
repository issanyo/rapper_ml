[Verse 1]
I'm doper than a Bobby Brown piss test
Bitches blow me 'til they ain't got no spit left
Do it movin' 'cause slow niggas get left
Get left and miss the game like a sick ref
A quick left and a overhand right
A fat .44, some doja and a mic
Are my weapons, of mass destruction
And detectives know not to ask me nothin'
I'm silent, I might speak Tagalog
Drink dirty martinis with the Spanish olive
Garlic and cheese on my French bread
Swallow it please when I get head
I'm pimp fed, girls feed me well
Never would they let the world see me fail
They bring me mail, like I'm a mailbox
A pimp with no gators, Air Force and Shell Tops

[Verse 2]
Back in the day I used to need the knocks
Posted at the spot, I used to bleed the block
Servin' weed and rocks, soft and even hop
Never leavin' the spot, wouldn't even leave for cock
If I needed some cock I made hutch come through
Go deep when she bend over, hut 1-2
What you wan' do with rude boy like me
Quick to come through with crew so hyphy
If she don't like me she must be a lesbo
I get it nightly, man, that's my schedule
Dre Bledsoe, I'm the quarterback
Whatever cost the most, I'ma order that
Across the border strapped my es√©s come through
With fluff from Peru, I come from a crew
Of cutthoats, bank robbers, and dope dealers
It's business with us, nigga, get out yo' feelin's
Get out yo' scrill and live like a king
Take the top off the Heem, pop you a thing
I don't buss 'em in half, it leave a nasty taste
I swallow 'em hole and get the Thizz face
It's laced, with nothin' but game
I steal 'em from niggas, that be cuffin' they dame
I'm fuckin' his main, while he gettin' his grind on
Get bossed, it cost, get paid then I'm gone
My tone, is loud sometimes
I scream at a bitch like she a crowd sometimes
Tell her a thousand times, 'hoe, go make it happen'
It's consequences if she don't make it happen
I'm tryin' to find some bitches that's dope paper havin'
Only into one thing, that's more paper havin'
You no paper havin', niggas is bootsy
All at the function in that Chinamen Gucci
Tryin' to coochie, you wine and dine chicks
Goin' for it, fallin' for mind tricks
I'm tryin' to find chicks, that know the requirements
And works towards a pimp's early retirement
