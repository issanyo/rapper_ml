Verse 1:

Picture a girl in a courtroom holding a baby one week young
And her baby daddy in handcuffs about to get hung—
Its life up out in the pen if he don’t snitch on his crew
Now tell me in this situation, what would you do?
Would you stay true to the game and route you chose to take?
Or would you break, take a dive in the game and go out like a snake?
If you gotta think about it, boy this game ain't for you
Get out quick, retire- find something else to do
Boy Ima let it be known, this game ain't for everybody
You got too many Sammy the bulls and not enough John gottis
I don rubbed shoulders with niggas that’ll kill over canned goods
Get you in a cell, poke you, and take your manhood
I done had to put my knife in dumb niggas for testing me
And bust caps at the one time to prevent them from arresting me
Boy the game is thick- and it ain't no joke
When you starving like 10 niggas name Marvin- I mean broke

Chorus:
The game is thick, got lots of mackin involved
You got to get your grits and keep stacking them y’all
Shake them tricks with loose lips cause loose lips sink ships
——These niggas is a trip
The game is thick, got lots of mackin involved
You got to get your grits and keep stacking them y’all
Shake them tricks with loose lips cause loose lips sink ships
——These niggas is a trip

Verse 2:

The game is thick shit gets deep as hoe pussy
So im walking a tight rope and hope they don’t push me
Cause when I snap my strap sings songs of murda
Had to shake my bitch cause I’m scared I might hurt her
During times like this, I’m a cold piece of work
My chop drop niggas and leave em with wet t-shirts
It hurts- when my dough is getting low boy
I gotta get some mo’ boy- these niggas don’t know boy
Im hongry- white around the mouth like cookie
Plus I gotta buy some new clothes for janookie
Its a terrible thang- but its a terrible game
Gotta be down and diry cause only the terrible hang
Im one of them used to be broke niggas that owed niggas for ounce sacks
And went under spending chips on fits but then bounced back
Them urban guerrilla survaval tactics
Some of you blade ass niggas need to practice

Chorus:
The game is thick, got lots of mackin involved
You got to get your grits and keep stacking them y’all
Shake them tricks with loose lips cause loose lips sink ships
——These niggas is a trip
The game is thick, got lots of mackin involved
You got to get your grits and keep stacking them y’all
Shake them tricks with loose lips cause loose lips sink ships
——These niggas is a trip

Verse 3:

I was once told collect everything thats sold
If you fuck, get blowed, everything that glitter ain't gold
They told me all thats alive surely one day got to die
That was back in 85 but now them same rules apply- i-
Been there- done that- made a savage comeback
Mothafuckas shook me but now the all tryna run back
Though i hold no grudges- i forgive but not forget
That them bitches want money from me, but all they get is dick- trill
Its not about the greazin- boy its money season
And everything that happens damn sure happens for a reason
Each playa teach playa- thats how playas learn
Everybody can’t be king boy- you got to wait your turn
Not enough Indians- and way too many chiefs
Thats why we steady getting fucked in the ass with no grease- cease!
This ones for you- michael Robinson too
Mac Dre from the double R crew- I thought you knew!

Chorus:
The game is thick, got lots of mackin involved
You got to get your grits and keep stacking them y’all
Shake them tricks with loose lips cause loose lips sink ships
——These niggas is a trip
The game is thick, got lots of mackin involved
You got to get your grits and keep stacking them y’all
Shake them tricks with loose lips cause loose lips sink ships
——These niggas is a trip
