[Intro: Dubee]
Yeah doe, bitch
The motherfucking Crestside is up in the building
You know we tearing shit up like this, man
'Cause you know, I'm first up to bat
I'm gonna start this shit like this here
So check it out, Foreezy

[Verse 1: Dubee]
Now I'mma crack my heem, twist my blunt
But you know MD and Sugawolf ain't know punk
Bringing it to ya, kick the really real to confool ya
Crestside pound, with style, and I'm the ruler
Riggity-rough and tough, strap 4-5's and stuff
In that niggity-North Pole is where you're finding us
Do it matter? Nope, we international
And boat super spokes while we smashing ho's
From deep in the east or even New York
I bet I got that Cali indo to smoke
Creeping tailored, talking more shit than a sailor
Twisting Backwood blunts can't fuck with Vega's
Now the ho's say a Nigga ain't shit, but I'm raw
Sharpshoot a saw, and put the grip in they jaw
Now what you thought? We chasing up some
Check a trump put that dump with my dump gun
Come from the Country Club Creeznest
Killer affiliated so I [?] by request
A nigga show my tactics
And eat up with a little [?] in this here rap shit

[Verse 2: Mac Dre]
Well here's a little something about a nigga like me
Young silky, R-O-M-P
Super fly lavish, Creesy savage
Love Kool-aid, neck bones and cabbage
Be in the cut, smoking the chronic
Nigga couldn't see me with a high bionic
Drink Micky not Miller, cold cot dealer
Got more ho's then they got in Chachilla
Super bad peela, got's to have skrilla
Bitch treat a nigga like I'm a mad killa
No man lying incarceration
Read to the general population
Silky, slim like Penny, smooth like Remy
But y'all don't hear me
Pockets so fat that I walk with a limp
And I'm doing big things with that Sugawolf Pimp

[Hook: Dubee]
We bout our money, get our paper
Snatch these ho's when our paper stack tall as skyscrapers
All you baller haters can't fuck with the real deal
'Cause the real deal get real skreal
And we rolling with out the windmills
We bout our money, get our paper
Snatch these ho's when our paper stack tall as skyscrapers
All you baller haters can't fuck with the real deal
'Cause the real deal get real skreal
And we rolling with out the windmills

[Verse 3: Dubee]
Now what if I whip the truck and twist a sack of some of that dosha
I'm nothing soldier, fuck with me and I'll fold ya
So trick don't get it twisted, I spit that potent pimp shit
Fuck with an OG pro up on the floor and get your bitch lipped
Party like I'm faded, 'cause I be captivating
Player haters who hate these players who fly without a cape
Now when a soldier skip to the rescue
I'm out with a gat in the Crest fool
[?] I whip then dip 'cause nigga that's what the cess do
So improve your macking skills, fuck Jack and Jill
I'm all about my skrill deal, so these real niggas feel me
OG game pumping up through my blood
So twist a twap sack and burn it down to the nub
We roll on Vogues and thang, it will be [?] to them 15's
Keep heat in your seat, clip in your shit, make sure your shit clean
Show no fear, call about this here
90's game so I maintain, steady Bogarding like a beer
And I swear on purple hair dosha dank that got me buzzing
Folks [?] so I know there ain't no love
In this environment, it's just retirement
When folks fuck with that heat and get burnt by the fire, bitch

[Verse 4: Mac Dre]
We putting that Country Club Crestside for shows
Love to choke, 420 smoke
That's dank, you ain't knowing? Ride Regals
My compadre cuddie, my amigo
I'm 24 Karat Bay Area road
And 707 is the area code
Popping like Jiffy, butter like Skippy
Old school like Rodney Allen Ripley
Hit me with your wide receiver
Million dollar man like that fool [?]
Never had a dog that didn't get down
Never had a broad that didn't kick down
Dick down, top notch [?]
Double down heels when I tap that ass
Making my cash, selling my game
I don't think they know mayne, tell 'em how we swang

[Hook: Dubee]
We bout our money, get our paper
Snatch these ho's when our paper stack tall as skyscrapers
All you baller haters can't fuck with the real deal
'Cause the real deal get real skreal
And we rolling with out the windmills
We bout our money, get our paper
Snatch these ho's when our paper stack tall as skyscrapers
All you baller haters can't fuck with the real deal
'Cause the real deal get real skreal
And we rolling with out the windmills
