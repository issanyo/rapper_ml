[Intro: Yukmouth]
Yes, little ones, ladies and gents
Thug niggas and pimps, gather around nigga
It's a baller event, you dig?
Mac-motherfucking-Drizay, my nigga
He's a real one, boy, the Romper Room Gang nigga
The head of the Romper Room Gang nigga
Real Vallejo thugs you bitch ass niggas
Four niggas just got out the feds from doing time
Back in the rap game, staining their ass baby

All these fake ass pimps out there talking about they pimping, ain't pimping shit but their mouthpiece ya dig?
Oh boy, watch out for this boy Mac Dre

Relax, pop your thizzles, bang this gangster shit baby, and oh boy
