[Intro]
Cutthoat dope
Cop you some nigga

[Verse One]
I keep it mackin'
Send an Anglo-Saxon to ask and get crackin'
C-notes when she come to cash in
What's happenin'?
Gang goofy tramps catch thrashings
Action macking, focused no distraction
Cutthroat nigga end in thumping and blappin'
Every time I'm on a song you know that's slappin'
Five-Tre-Five I'm a coach like Madden
Could never be short but small nigga you slackin'
Pussy like Toni Braxton
Slap you so hard that your backflipping backspinning
Break these busters all down in fractions
Big game hunter mayne these lames is napping

[Verse Two: Mac Dre]
I'ma gangsta mack
I'm cold as pimp Slurpee
Make a bitch give me fifty reps a burpee
When she fuck up
I'm a pimp that's stuck up
Loose lips get told to shut the fuck up
I'm not the sucka
You motherfucka
Dre quick to trip and go blucka blucka
40 cal slugs
Northern Cal thugs
[?] strip they sure to have dubs
Dub sacks, dub rims and dub rocks
Heckler and Koch

Nigga ain't playin'
Spray 'em, no delayin'
Twenty nine with the bag, get your scale and weigh 'em
[?]
Mushrooms and toys
And they all for sale, go see my boys
The turf is gurpin'
We smoking purpin'
Up the block in something hot
Skirt and chirpin'

[Chorus]
We tryna get paper mayne
For the right place you could date the dame

Hurry up run, get the fuck out of town

[Verse Four: Mac Dre]
I'm a 7-0-7 North bear
Do they got bomb out there?
Of course player
Porsche Carrera on my side
People looking at me like I stole my ride
I'm in my five Mercedes, new millenni
With hella ladies, on shrooms and Henny
Late night dinners, coming home from the strip club
That french hair let the bitches get picked up
This is a stick up, hands in the air
You got jewels and money you best be handing 'em here
I'm the Man of the year, simply underrated
Them other motherfuckers is simply inflated
[?]
I cause some trouble
Niggas hit the bushes when the see the X double
I'll cut your Cletus
Stay clutching heaters
And make a motherfucker read these Adidas

[Chorus]
We tryna get paper mayne
For the right place you could date the dame
A player tryna shine, can't hate the rain
Love ain't shit can't take the pain
Drugs ain't shit if you ain't [?]
Thugs ain't shit don't play them games
The slugs ain't shit [?]
Gloves no prints, no trace of names
Shells, no [?]
