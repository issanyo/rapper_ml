[Verse 1]
When we pull up to the light, the people all stare
Four niggas in the Benz with the dreadlock hair
Smoke everywhere, wavin at Madeline
On them woodgrain Davins with the license plate rattlin'
Doin' what we want to, hangin' out the sunroof
Mental, we ignorant, boy we go dumb dude
Gas break dip, we call it yokin'
Do a donut in yo whip, we call it dosin'
Get stupid, is what we do good
Ghost ride the whip while we dancing on the hood
I'm amped feeling good, I'm hyphy
In a bitch face with a thizz face off a Nike
The women like me, I'm dipped in butter
I'll rob your brother pimp the blood out your mother
I'm mister stupid doo-doo dumb
Sumthin' Terrible, tell 'em how we come

[Chorus]
We go S - T - U - P - I - D
When we go to the club we don't need ID
Everywhere we go its a party yall
We gone get it cracking like the Mardi Gras
Get stupid, get stupid, get stupid, get stupid
Go stupid, go stupid, go stupid
Come and go stupid with me

[Verse 2]
I'm a dog, hound, Crestside clown
Gig so hard make my pants fall down
This beat pounds, cutty where'd you get it?
Oh you ain't know, Dr. Dre did it
I come wit it, rapping and rhyming
Dancin, pantomiming, acting like I'm driving
Then switch it up, dance like him fishing
See in the bay area we dance a lil different
The bay bounce to thizzle, the west coast wizzle
Do they get stupid, come fuck with Drizzle
Call the hospital, he's having convulsions
No he's gettin' stupid, in his load yokin'
Is the store still open?
We need heem, that Privilege thing...yadadamean?
All in the throw like yee
S - T - U - P - I - D

[Chorus]
We go S - T - U - P - I - D
When we go to the club we don't need ID
Everywhere we go its a party yall
We gone get it cracking like the Mardi Gras
Get stupid, get stupid, get stupid, get stupid
Go stupid, go stupid, go stupid
Come and go stupid with me

[Verse 3]
Alright, let me tell you why we call this thing stupid
Cause, when I dance the chicks, say: 'you stupid'
You can do it, it ain't that hard
Baby get dumb, act like a retard
Shake your hair, make it blow in the air
You gotta get into it, growl like a bear
Now say Wha! 'What?' No, Wha!
Do the damn thing girl cut that shit up
Fill your cup, don't be no punk
It don't look right if you really ain't drunk
Come on, repeat after me we go S - T - U - P - I - D

[Chorus]
Stupid? Hahaha
We go S - T - U - P - I - D
When we go to the club we don't need ID
Everywhere we go its a party yall
We gone get it cracking like the Mardi Gras
Get stupid, get stupid, get stupid, get stupid
Go stupid, go stupid, go stupid
Come and go stupid with me
