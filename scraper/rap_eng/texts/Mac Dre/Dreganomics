[Intro]
(Uhh wha yea) arriba (mmmhmmm)
Si senor (come mon wha wha)

[Verse 1]
I'm gettin' northern exposure in Santa Rosa
The ponderosa where they grow the doja
Thizzle wiggle with that thug composure
Cuz when them streets mold ya you gonna be a solja
I drink and nod in the Range Rover
I beg God to look over my shoulders
Sometimes I slip up, trip; I'm not perfect
Got thug I'm my blood what I love ta turf it
I make it worth it I buy nice things
Tryna to keep life right for me and my team
What do you mean
It's all about the green
Tryna ta make my duffle bags bust at the seams
I get ruffles dad yep lots of cream
Got them haters mad but I'll pop the thing
Take the top off the heem
Pour out a little liquor
My game gets sicker when the game gets thicker (come on)

[Hook x2]
Follow me now let me lead the way
If you gon believe in something believe in dre
It's only civilized for us to live our lives
Royal, spoiled, the american way
Dreganomics

[Verse 2]
I live life lav, feddy and boss
Cuz partner whats spaghetti without the sauce
Noodles
And I'll never be a noodle
Cutthroat pit bull fucking over poodles
Strudel, pies and cakes
Them sweet niggas liars and fakes
I bite and shake go right for the jugular
I break a broad go hard while you lovin her
Nigga quit huggin her, giving up that free love
We pimp the blood outta bitches, boy we thugs
Keep her away from the circle
Cuz next us, fool, you look like Urkel
Mikey pass the purple I'm feelin myself
Finna go for the gusto start stealin my wealth
Entrepreneur plantin seeds in manure
Making change grow and my game matures (come on)

[Hook x2]

[Verse 3]
I hunt for my tribe bring home the kill
Smoke blunts, get high off only the real
Want more than a meal, boy, I want a Manwich
A seven figure digit money sandwich
You funny faggots are all in the way
I do more before breakfast then you do all day
Don't mean to sound sexist but you all gay
Quit using that Oil of Olay
Mac Dre, a lone desperado
Who gonna press the throttle if the boys try ta follow
My boys got the hollows they hurt when they hit ya
Leave me lone when you gone off that perk and the liquor
Nigga, I'm a grown ass man
Tryna' live off the fat of the land
Proceed as planned
Stay focused
It's dreganomics--I got doses (come on)

[Hook x2]

[Outro]
Uh Dreganomics (Dreganomics?)
It's Dreganomics (Dreganomics?)
Dreganomics (Dreganomics?)
It's Dreganomics (it's Dreganomics)
Yea boy
Ronald Dregan
I campaign with this game mane
Yadadamean?
And I will let you Noriega types
Bring it across for the right price
Feel me family
Yeah Dreganomics--I got doses
