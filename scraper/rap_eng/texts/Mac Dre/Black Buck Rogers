[Verse 1: Mac Dre]
Shes a Dime playa, but I need a 15
A queen lookin like she need to be in a magazine
Or a movie scene, movin the green
Working for a team thats working for a king
40s and 19, lean, bustin out the seams
Of tight jeans, no one night flings
I need something thats gon' bring things that bling bling to a king
Green, what do you mean?
A hutch thats breezy like afro-sheen
Get down wit another broad, if thats yo' thing
Its a natural thing, and Im smooth as cream
And I know, you can, sell a fool a dream
Top notch-er, betta watch her
Space age pimp the black buck rogers
(space age pimp the black buck rogers)

[Hook]
Tryna Have plenty in the new millenni, space age mac the black buck rogers
Tryna Have plenty in the new millenni, space age mac the black buck rogers
Tryna Have plenty in the new millenni, space age mac the black buck rogers
Tryna Have plenty in the new millenni,(im the) space age mac the black buck rogers

[Verse 2]
I ain't a trick but I'll spend a little, to make a lot
U ain't tryna pop? then hutch shake the spot
Got to make a knot every time I work
When the stack gets back kick back and purp
I cold in it, hope you soak in it
What side you ride with, broke or rich?
?, try to get by her
Ass with the most cash, lives higher
It ain't a problem that I can't fix
I keep it popin and makes more chips
Make more hits and get the crew HYPHY
Shes my bitch but thats yo' wifey
Im maccin it, immaculate
The heat gon skeet when im packin it
If she a notch betta watch shell sneak and cheat
With the black buck rogers bee dee beep beep beep

[Hook]
Tryna Have plenty in the new millenni, space age mac the black buck rogers
Tryna Have plenty in the new millenni, space age mac the black buck rogers
Tryna Have plenty in the new millenni, space age mac the black buck rogers
Tryna Have plenty in the new millenni,(im the) space age mac the black buck rogers

[Verse 3]
Mac Dre the black buck rogers
Got drafts and cuts like the dodgers
Run a check on her, before im up in her
Shirt says champ but is she really a winner?
Or really a beginner tryn to enter
If she coo then foo ima send her
Its all about the cash put the trash in the can
If you dont understand girl im the man
Stick to my plan, we can live life lav
24/7 I get my cash
Stash dash shake the task
If a punk start funk dont wait to blast
Ima cutthroat if you must know
I go for the green and the gusto
Dont trust no body like maudy (snitch)
The black buck rogers is hyphin the party
