[ VERSE 1 ]
I been tryin to flip the script and take this rap thing to the next page
But the federalies got me travellin on _Con Air_ like I'm Nicholas Cage
Did 4 years, 4 months in the feds, but couldn't get no peace
Released from the belly of the beast, but the 'ralies put a nigga on a leash
The rules and regulations they inflicted, had me restricted, paroled
Kept me from blowin bomb, knowin I'm hooked and addicted for sho'
And how am I to be an MC when I can't get my travel on?
Can't bring no babby home, 'cause every morning I'm gettin sweated by Babylon
The only way out is to max out and give these fools back they lease
Fuck parole, probation, piss test and supervised release
I'mma bring a calendar, bounce, blow up like Chernobyl
Kirk out and get mobile and do this thing global
Worldwide rompin', stompin' in other nations
Blowin' bomb with Jamaicans, and sippin' Dom with them Haitians
Kickin' major flows, have Asian hoes, playin' the Romp like it's for eternity
Kick gravel, travel, see what they know about me in Werbach, Germany

[ Hook (Repeat 2X): Dubee ]
We be global
Touch land in that sand over the seas
Blew off a couple of G's, releasin' verbal telekinese, for sheez
Clickalate with players, under the stairs, to the Himalayas
Kinda thick, layer for layer

[ VERSE 2 ]
Sometimes I sit and reminisce about life in '87
When I was doin' my thug thang, brain ten miles higher than heaven
One-track minded, blinded by the game and quick change
Not knowin across the way-way niggas were doin' big thangs
And it's a shame
Cause before I hit the F-E-D's
I didn't know about them niggas in Cuba and them sisters in Belize
Now I'm curious: Is Belizan pussy the bomb?
When they blow, do they hum, and how quick do they come?
Boy, it's time to hit the friendly skies and fly like a seagull
Post up in spots where the pot's good and legal
Eat tacos in Mexico with cats named Flaco
And catch a red-eye flight the same night to Morocco
Top-nacho, chasin' superbad scrilla fiends
Then bounce to the Phillipines and get mo' head than guillotines
Boy, life ain't nothin but fat checks and head sex
So I'mma get mobile, stay global like FedEx

[ VERSE 3 ]
I was a cell dweller, eatin' Top Ramen and sardines
Now it's Taiwanese Japanese cuisine
Barefooted, fitted, sippin' on sake
Blow on big hashish while I feast on teriyaki
International is how I'm smashin', hoe
A cutthroat nigga that will blast and roll
I took a trip to Queens to see Jazz and Preme
They had a nigga blowin' brown, said it wasn't no green
But that ain't no thang, cause in Tacoma
I blew bomb 'til I was in a coma
And in Seattle my partner Chilly Chill
Got that purple leaf dank that really real
I'm global, boy, I be travellin'
Gettin' further in the air like a javelin
Chirpitch, kirkitch, finna bounce to St. Croix
Mac Dre, global, holler at your boy
