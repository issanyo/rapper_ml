[Verse 1]
Kick back, relax, let me bust one (bust one)
And don't trip if I cuss one (cuss one)
A two-times Romper spittin' the shit
It's just a way a nigga straight be gettin' the grit
Microphone master Mac Dre is the name
I got donkey for a bitch and when I'm slangin' the thang
Hoes go delirious 'cause the dick is so serious
Fuckin' bitch after bitch, 'cause they all be curious
A young nigga down to break you for everything
And 'Mr. Flamboyant' is a song I'll never sing
I'm not with The Click shit, I'm straight with the sick shit
And any South sucka, I'm ready to get wit'
Romped out Crest down muthafucka
This Romp life I could never get enough of
Ridin', sidin', whippin', dippin'
24-7, a nigga ain't trippin'
Hoes steady tryna do me
Stay the fuck back, you damn tramp hoochie
M.D., the playa of the 9-0
You got 10 bitches, I got 10 fine hoes
That's how it goes, I'm a pimp and it shows
Stay on my toes (x4)

[Verse 2]
I'm a lyrical rap-speakin-makin-beatin combination
Straight from the Crest, unlike the rest, I'm here to rock the nation
I'm down with E and A.G. Curt, Marty and Jason
I smoke the weed, it gets me keyed, but never would I be lacin'
Nothin' clean, on the heem, you rarely see me sober
I break a bitch who's filthy rich, I'm always gettin' over
Give me ya number on the under, love to get to know ya
I'd get ya hot and hit the spot, just gimme the chance to show ya
The M the A the C the D the R the E
Suckers imitate, but it's hard to be
A young playa shootin' to the tizzop
Could never be a sucker who's sprung on some cizzot
Mac Drizzay, the one you like to listen to
I'm on the dizzank and now I'm fixin' to
Get dizzope with some shit I wrizzote
I got a Chizzev and every time I yizzoke
You see smizzoke and then you start to chizzoke
Pockets stay fizzat, could never be brizzoke
Mac Drizzay, all damn dizzay, I get bizzay and stack that pizzay
The one you like to hear recite the raps I write
I never bite, I'm not the type, don't take me light, we'll have to fight
Sick with the shit, so muthafucka, you better get it right
A money makin', hoochie sinkin', Crestside player
6-foot-1 with lots of curls in my hair
So much game I need to run for mayor
She steady pays me, but I never will pay her
Day, Ray and clique, they got my bizzack
Ronnie, D and Freak, some more in the pizzack
My manager Stan drives a Cadillizzac
And Khayree pays me real fizzat

Fizzat (x6)
I'm just a mizzack, mizzack
Makin' lotsa money on the Sage Street trizzack
Trizzack (x4)
Stay on my toes
I'm just a mi-, mi-, mi-, mi-, mi-, mi-, mizzack, mizzack, mizzack
Stay on my toes (x3)
