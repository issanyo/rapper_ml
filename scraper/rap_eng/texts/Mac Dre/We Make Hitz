[Intro]
(Oh what a hit we make)
Uh, what, uh
(Oh what a hit we make)
We make hits, bitch we make hits
(Oh what a hit we make)
Hello? Hello?
(Oh what a hit we make)
Can you hear me now?
Yeah, we make 'em

[Verse 1: Mac Dre]
Why don't she, why won't she
One day she gon' see, she got me lonely
Those are words you'll never hear from us
You didn't know it's pimping over here with us?
Oh what a hit we make
Never giving a bitch a break
Sipping on them vintage grapes
Police we quick to shake
Pedal to the metal never hit the brakes
Smoking hella weed no sticks or shake
Smoke with hella niggas I instigate
Jumping on niggas I hit and skate
Fans they, pitcure take
Your man's they, pimpatrate
I'mma take all the money the ho make
She gonna keep it coming man and don't wait
I don't fake, I don't hate
When I put my voice on tape
Everybody go so stupid dumb
Everybody say, "man he can come"
Like 151 Bacardi rum, Dre gon' get the party dumb
Always got bomb for the lungs
And when the police come man, I run
Yoking something, dosing something, smoking something
Psycho make them ho's sing
