I'm out of this world, not your run of the mill'n
My name is fur I'm the owner of the building
I'm a stoner and I'm chillin with two bitches like Jack
I pimps and I mac drive a Benz and a 'lac
Man I've been in the back wit the groupies and the stars
I've been out front with the thugs in the cars
I've been in the yard with the Mexican mafia
And I only run with niggas that'll kill and die for ya
I'm popular, I'm a rap star
But I live like a rock star running from the cop cars
I drop bars wit slaps that knock hard
And I charge with this dick extra large
I'm sick of these whores higher than Mars
And I treat my bitch like an ATM card

[Chorus: repeat 4X]
I'm in the buildin and I'm feelin myself
Man I'm feelin myself

She's in the buildin and she's feelin herself
She's lookin bad man I'm willing to help
Stop it baby your killin yourself
Come on I got your back you could chill in my
I'm feelin myself too
Man imagine some of the things we can do
You under me
Me under you
Then we can catch the liquor store before 2:00

We can hit my nigga and go get some shrooms
And if you still want to kick it then we can go get a room
It won't cost you much
I'm a good guy
Dick-on-discount bitch good bye
What do I look like mr. Frank Fuck for Free
No Dope Hoe you can't fuck with me
Get the fuck out
Bitch you still on my dick
You full of shit and I'm feelin myself

[Chorus]

I'm a Westcoast Bad Boy, I represent it
Wait that's a bad tune is it rented
Hardy har har very funny
You don't hear my tummy, I gets my money
My stomach ain't growlin, I'm stylin and whylin
Drink vodka straight fuck the Long Island
I want my own Island bet you I'm a get it
I switch hit and play with both mits
I pack a 45th Im after your bitch
He ain't doing it right shes after your scritch
And I'm after hers with these macing words nerd
I thawed squares stage shark
Your nothing but a mark in a fuckin Sky Lark
I'm playing my part, I'm Mr. Furley
Put in the rum and I'm talkin to your girly

[Chorus]
