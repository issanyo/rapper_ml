[Intro: Mac Dre]
Oh, OK, that's what we're gonna do
We're gonna slow the thing down then
Slow the thing down thenâ€”let's do It
Let's do it then, man
You know, I'm way the fuck up here in Alaska, man
With some major factors, man
And we have no choice but to do it real real real real big
You feel me, family? Real real real real big
Mac muthafuckin' Dre

[Verse 1: Mac Dre]
My compadre Hector got the nectar, talkin' about the soft sack
We tryin' to off that, but toss that, nigga, I'm a boss Mac
I break bad ass bitches that don't talk back
No, I'm no soft cat, I'm on her back like a bra-strap
On her head like a straw cap, spit nothin' but the raw facts
Yeah, I fucked off racks, the one the bitch brought back
Money, dummy, the only thing that quench thirst
I think I'm skrich cursed, gotta get my chips first (Ching ching)
I bump me a thick nurse, be all in the bitch purse
No chips, she can disperse, this just ain't a slick verse
It's mackin', cuddie; it's stackin', cuddie
Keep it cutthoatish, leave a nigga smacked and bloody
Mac is nutty, two cans short of a 6-pack
I plug a sucka with a big strap; muthafucka, you betta get back
This that...stupid doo doo dumb shit
Something for my major factor niggas to run wit'

[Hook: Miami the Most + Mistah F.A.B.]
This is how the game goes
All of my niggas mack and some of my niggas pimpin'
Most of my niggas jackin', none of my niggas slippin'
This is how the game goes
We stay on top of our toes, gettin' this money from hoes
Brand new whips and clothes, this is all we know
This is how the game goes
All of my niggas mack and some of my niggas pimpin'
Most of my niggas jackin', none of my niggas slippin'
This is how the game goes
We stay on top of our toes, gettin' this money from hoes
Brand new whips and clothes, this is all we know

[Verse 2: Mistah F.A.B.]
I'm Mister Sav, it's Mistah F.A.B
If you don't like me, you can kiss my ass
Where we at is cold, chilly willy, stupid dumb, silly billy
Stay high with E's, try not to freeze
Smoke a lot of trees, some pop the E's
Ay Dre, do me a favor, let your cuzzo just rock the keys
I'm niggoret, and that's ignorant
A lot of niggas hate, I'm never hearin' it
I stroll with limp and don't fuck with wimps
No Top Ramen, I fuck with shrimp
I'm a son of a pimp, you see me dad
I know why I smile, don't see me mad
The prince is here, front to rear
Thizz what it iz, let's get this clear
No mal flow, it's wild, bro, so hard you think I'm on BALCO
No steroids, or corticoids, everywhere I go, they snap Polaroids
It's Fabby D, don't be mad at me
I'm the type hoes be glad to see
I'm a prince and a pimp, you can call me Young Majesty

[Verse 3: Mistah F.A.B.]
This is how we do it now, sir, you must be new in town
Today, tonight, it's goin' down
You're more than welcome to come around
Don't hate, this must be done, P-I-M-P, I must be one
Clean pimp, I ain't just begun
I'm serious, but this is all fun
I Mac like D-R-E, signed with Thizz, it ain't hard to see
And yeah, I still roll with G's
So don't shoot, just be worried about me
I'm a prince, I'm a king and the truth
I do my thing in the streets and the booth
Son of a pimp, the real deal, point blank
Don't smoke weed, and I don't drank
Just make it crank, what ya think?
I gotta get bank, I refuse to sink
I rise like yeast in fall
Buy whips, no lease at all
If you pay attention, I can teach ya, dawg
Yeah, I'll show you how to ball
Do it big, real big and tall
And I'll be back if you need to fall
