Here's a little something about me damac
I like the low cut jeans where you can see the crack
Get drunk off the priv, the heem, the yak
Then drink a double shot, to bring me back
I'm from where you never see a seed in a sack
The Bay boy and Dre boy is bringing it back
I'm "handlin suffa", what's the meaning of that?
You'll never see a nigga that's as clean as the Mac

[Verse 1:]
Call me Mr. Kleenex, I'm so cold
Icy wrists like I've been making snow cones
What's up homes? What size them rims is?
Twenty-two mother fucking inches
Seats big as benches, I never touch wrenches
The only work I do, is working these bitches
My palm itches, that means money
Have you ever seen bling, bling when it ain't sunny?
This ain't funny, they can't slow me down
Big bad wolf can't blow me down
Every bad bitch, want to blow me now
Oh you know me now? oh you my homie now?
I get dumb, stewy in your face
Hop out the Benz with the Louis briefcase
Cheapskate? Fuck the price
You ain't really cool if you ain't got ice

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Dre get whip shipped fresh off the dock
A mafia type, drink scotch on the rocks
The weed man love me, I cop quarter pops
Do a donut on the cops, fuck the shocks, make the car hop
Shake me locks on the hoes jock
I make them robots, they bring me swoll' knots
I bring them show knocks, boy Dre spit heaters
Four door mob shots, don't fuck with two seaters
I fuck with two heaters, identical twins
When I ain't feelin' the Henn man I'm killin' the gin
Rhyme stealin' again, dime stealin' again
Stab the blood out a nigga like I'm still in the pen
Uhh, Elvis ex-b
Fuck her if she sexy, fuck with Num and Yuk
Fuck with Quinn and Messy
C-R-E-S-T, the Bay I'm mappin' this
Niggas start slappin' this, ASAP-alis

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Man there go the police, I'm not trippin'
I'm too legit to quit and I'm squeaky clean pimpin'
If they see me when I'm dippin' I got "El Debarges"
And a square bitch with me, to the take the charges
I'm fly as I partridge, keep a extra cartridge
Down like linoleum, rugs and carpets
When I park it, uhh, the Benz rims still spin
On Market and O'Ferrell, I still pimp
You still rent? I got 4 paid for
It's Mac Dre-goes, taking your pesos
Cause I like gravy on my potatoes
Rap and break hoes, is how my day goes
On fire like Dego, I'm out of control
And like KC cheese, I'm on a roll
I'm on a roll like the Greyhound bus
The hoes hound us and always surround us
The Adam's Mark suite, is where they found us
It's home run hits, no flies or groundas
