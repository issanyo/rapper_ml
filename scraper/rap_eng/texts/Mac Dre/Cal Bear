Whaaaa...
Drizzle, California Hot Boy makin' it sizzle
Yadadadada

[Verse 1]
I'm a roper smoker, love to yoke a, chevy when I'm ripter
Used to post up on the block with dope I got from Victor
I go nuts, do donuts when I'm full of that liquor
Get ho bucks man so much I ran game and pimped her
My thang thang got twisters, two sets like sisters
Davins, and choppers there's no stoppin Mister
A California Bear, all up in your ear
While I'm playing with your hair, bitch I'm a player
It ain't fair, niggas like me is rare
Hard to find, you might not find one like me anywhere
You can search tall trees, the bottom of the seas
Nigga please, they don't make them like these
Huh what you say, you gone do what?
I murder, get further, in my coughnut
Geeks I chew up, in the streets I grew up
I run with niggas that'll peel a nigga for a few bucks
I'm sewing thangs up, got the game on lock
Give you an E for effort, but it ain't no knock
Man this thang don't stop, I'm all night like Denny's
I'm countin' thow-wows while you scrapin' for pennies
I'm tight like two hemmies, dope like two gremmies
Put a dub in the blunt cause I don't like them skinny
Mafia like Benny, I offer ya some remy
Playboy, from the bay boy
I sav lav, ya hear me?
