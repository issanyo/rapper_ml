Young black brotha can never be a lover
He keeps a joint in one hand and heem in the other
So fly you never see him bummy
He's never had a job and keeps a pocket full of money
Lit lows Daytons and Vogues
A beeper on his belt and a gang of hoes
Been in and out of jail since the day he was ten
The hall, the county, and next is the pen
See he really doesn't know what the game's about
Get in stack a bank and get the fuck out
Because a D-boy's life is cool at first
But in the end it's the pen or even worst a hearse
Young brotha, loves to get keyed
'Cause he feels so good when he's hittin' the weed
He's never been to high school let alone college
And has so much game and to much knowledge
Some call him a sad case but how do they figure
Many wanna be like that young nigga
And its not just him it's another and another
'Cause many of us live the life of a young black brotha

[Break]
Hes a young black brotha

[Verse 2]
18 years on this earth and Oakland is my place of birth
And now the big CREST SIDE! is where I stay
Va-lay-ho
Cal-i-fron-ie-ay
Mob shots
Drop tops
Base cocaine and crooked cops
Niggas grindin' to stack a bank
And to flip a fresh load with the candy paint
Some fail and some succeed
Some sell coke and some sell weed
Some pimp hoes
And some straight gank
Any damn thang to stack that bank
Young black brotha he's a business man
Tryin' to make money any way he can
Clockin' hoes, rollin' Vogues
Smokin' the weed that's how it goes
Young black brotha hes doin' it man
Gettin' at a ho with a brew in his hand
He gets the number and then he burns rubber
'Cause he's livin' the life of a young black brotha

[Break]
He's a  young black brotha
Khayree break it down for me one time

[Verse 3]
Hoes jock they throw the cock
At a young black brotha rosing to the top
Material stroller pushin' one dollar snakes
And Daytons and Vogues is all it takes
For a young black brotha to peel her like fruit roll
And straight thrust and find him a new ho
Be a Mac nigga a straight Mac nigga
And kick back and let the bank get bigger
Find a million dollar spot but don't get hot
'Cause you'll feel so dumb when you got popped
Peep game and let the shit soak man
Don't be another little dope man
Get in where you fit in if you don't then squeeze
Stack G's, will you please
I'm Mac Dre baby the young black brotha
The young nigga on the album cover
From the Bay boy
Mac Dre boy
The mutherfucking Mac ass play boy
Making dope rhymes another and another
And I'm livin' the life of a young black brotha

[Break]
Hes a young black brotha

Yeah I'd like say wussup to my young black brothas
On the Crest Side the best side
Yeah young Marty ya wussup [?]
[?] , Nut ya we all kickin' it tuff
Tryin' to get right about some game mayne

My young black brothas, my young black brothas
