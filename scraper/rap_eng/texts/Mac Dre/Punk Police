[Hook (Repeat 14X)]
Punk police

[Verse 1]
Stop—I can't take no mo'
Why is the police steady knockin' at my do'?
24-7, the devils be trippin'
They say some banks was robbed and I fit the description
But that's drama, so save it for your mama
I'm not criminal minded, punk police, I'm a
Dope rhyme dealer, not a money stealer
Was real in '91, but now I'm much realer
On the streets you roam, tryna follow me home
Steady runnin' checks, on me and my Brougham
You see my mother is worried, you got her vision all blurry
You throwin' darts at my partner's poster - and he's buried?
Restin' in peace, but you won't give him no peace
Man, you punk police, I'm not the savage beast
You labeled us a ruthless G-A-N-G
But the biggest gangsters are on the VPD
They hate to see me drivin' a car I bought
They hate how I talk, I can't spit on the sidewalk
They roughin' and cuffin' me, in jail they be duffin' me
Every damn day, mayne, they can't get enough of me
I could maybe understand if I was breakin' the law
And I'mma dedicate this to Detective McGraw
You be steady accusin', but these cases you losin'
You be steady abusin', mayne, do you find it amusin'?
Well, haha, haha, I'mma laugh in your face
While you kick on back and feel the bass
Punk police with a one-track mind
Man, you can't even find who's been robbin' you blind
It got deep, so you had to blame somebody
What's next—you gon' frame somebody?
You gon' frame somebody?
(You gon' frame somebody?)
Is you gon' frame somebody?
(Is you gon' frame somebody?)

[Hook (Repeat 10X)]
Punk police

[Verse 2]
For the dumb punk one-time I've got one rhyme
You can't stop sweatin' me, no, not even sometime
You fuss and cuss at, would love to bust at
A brother like me, always searchin' my nutsack
'Punk Police' I named this cut
And punk police, I'll tell you what
You need to stop trippin' and cold do your job
Stop tryna be ruthless and stop tryna mob
Punk police are nothin' clean
Look how they did Rodney King
In every neighborhood, state, city, and town
A crooked policeman can be found
Off-duty he never would squab hard
But give him that gat, badge and that squad car
Then it's jack time, fuck-with-a-black time
I'm talkin' real, man, listen to a Mac rhyme
Listen to a Mac rhyme

[Hook (Repeat 9X)]
Punk police

[Outro]
And it don't stop, and it don't quit
Punk police can't tell me shit
I'm just a Romp star goin' to the top far
You can't stop me strikin' in my Cadillac car
Straight doin' it, straight doin' it
Romper Room crewin' it, Romper Room crewin' it
I can't stop doin' it, can't stop doin' it
Straight Romp crewin' it, straight Romp crewin' it
Can't stop doin' it, can't stop doin' it
Romper Room crewin' it, Romper Room crewin' it
Punk police
Get off, Khayree
[guitar solo]

Yeah
What's up, Mac, mayne?
Oh, we ain't forgot about you, nigga
You still in the house
We love you, mayne
Ha, straight Romp shot
We comin' up for you, baby boy
Fuck the punk police
