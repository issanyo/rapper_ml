[Intro: Mac Dre]
Y’all call ‘em lushes (Lushes)
We call ‘em winos (Nigga, we call ‘em winos!)
We fuck on hutches (We fuck on hutches)
Y’all suck on them fine hoes (Suckin’ on them fine hoes)

[Verse 1: Hachet]
You gotta be careful in this game, nigga (Why is that?)
Cause there’s sharks and hyenas ready for attack
I’m a Mac, like my potna Dre
Been in this game since back in the day
I don’t play, I let the hot ones speak
I ain’t no geek, a drug dealing connoisseur
Came up from the sewer to a high class
Push an S-Class with TVs in the dash
Live the fast life, dodging task and the vice
Get your mind right (Chase them dollars)
Get your grind right (Homie, be a baller)
Get them big faces, do whatever it takes
And stay away from snakes that hibernate in gang
We came, we conquered, the game, we honor
Scrillionaires, not L-7 squares
We Turf Buccaneers (Turf Buccaneers)

[Hook: Hachet + (C-Lim)]
We keep it gangsta! (What’s really?)
We keep it gangsta! (Then deal it)
We keep it gangsta! (What’s really?)
We keep it gangsta! (Gots to kill me)
We keep it gangsta! (What’s really?)
We keep it gangsta! (What’s really?)
We keep it gangsta! (Then deal it)
We keep it gangsta! (Gots to kill me)

[Verse 2: Mac Dre]
Living off the fat of the land with my hot hand
Don’t fuck with hot boys, I fuck with firemans
Retire, man, them careers early
It’s Mac Furly, dope as a Felix birdie
I get it dirty, from Hillcrest to Hurley
Tried and tested, respected, I’m sturdy
Do or die, twisted like a ratchet
Blowing blunts down a backstreet with Hachet
See it, we snatch it, heat it, with plastic
MD it, we tragic, and leave ‘em, blasted
Serioso, bigger than oh so
I bring the flames, lame, never come so-so
Loco, nut in the Cougnut
Helping out the Roofie Boo Boo—fool, what?
Let’s get it crackin’, leave the acting for the TV
Believe me, you don’t wanna see me

[Hook: Hachet + (C-Lim)]
We keep it gangsta! (What’s really?)
We keep it gangsta! (Then deal it)
We keep it gangsta! (What’s really?)
We keep it gangsta! (Gots to kill me)
We keep it gangsta! (What’s really?)
We keep it gangsta! (What’s really?)
We keep it gangsta! (Then deal it)
We keep it gangsta! (Gots to kill me)

[Verse 3: C-Lim]
You ain’t heard of C-Lim? Well, that’s ‘cause I don’t fuck with you
While we in a BMW
Fuck it, when your feet up, Cutlass movin’
Through the streets like the undercovers do
I’m out the window, C’d up on your muthafuckin’ crew
Like I give a feenuck about you muthafuckin’ fools
I might squeeze through a couple bars, get my cap on
Ride or die like the Double-R ‘cause I spit fire like Drag-On
‘Cause I’m from the O and you know I’m a crazy fool
With a 4-54 raging bull
I hit the Moe just to kick it with some niggas that’s rough
Then hit the ‘Sco just to kick it with some niggas that bust
Don’t forget the O ‘cause the chickens be hella thick at the butt
Out there, fuck the studio, I’m hittin’ the club
Out there (Just to see) what’s really
(It’s us three) So just bill me

[Hook: Hachet + (C-Lim)]
We keep it gangsta! (What’s really?)
We keep it gangsta! (Then deal it)
We keep it gangsta! (What’s really?)
We keep it gangsta! (Gots to kill me)
We keep it gangsta! (What’s really?)
We keep it gangsta! (What’s really?)
We keep it gangsta! (Then deal it)
We keep it gangsta! (Gots to kill me)
