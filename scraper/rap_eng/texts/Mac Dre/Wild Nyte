[Intro: Husalah]
(Wild night man)
Nigga, yeah, yeah, uh, yeah uh…nigga
Straight mob shit
Turn the zap up man (know what I’m sayin’?)
Yeah, turn my zap up (know what I’m sayin’?)
Yo, yo, yo

[Verse 1: Husalah]
I’m a mobster, block shockin’ drug nigga
I love dealers that slap bitches in the mouth, yeah it sound foul
Dippin' dummy down south, clockin’ stupid thous’
Trues nigga on my feet, I’m a wild child
On my way to blaow blaow, you can plow down
I pull up bounce out, watch niggas break like wild style
Your girl take a lot of dick, tryin’ to break a nigga stick
Ya nigga hit her with a tip that’ll break any bitch
Look at her smile now, she know it’s true
So she choose, let her wild out
Instead of handcuffin’ the bitch, let her out the house
Get her back when I yank my dick out her mouth
Then kiss her, let her know she ya honey bun
I love money chump, fresh sneaks and bloody guns
That’s how I rock doggy
That’s how you should, gracefully, beautifully thrashin’ niggas
It’s Young Husalah nigga

[Hook: Husalah]
Aye yo, Tell me one thing baby
Do you wanna wild out and go crazy?
Pull your rack out quick and get nasty
While I dip in my low like a gangsta
I pull my chop out, clear the parkin’ lot out
With your girl in my whip givin’ mop out
Now get real loose baby, go crazy
It’s a wild night we all goin’ crazy

[Verse 2: Mac Dre]
It was a wild night cuddy, you missed out
Showed a bitch some beads, she pulled her tits out
When I touched ‘em, she tripped out
I almost slapped breakfast out the bitch mouth
She had a big ass, that need a big house
I kicked her in it and dipped out
Man I tell you, the night was wild
Did a show, bowed, jumped in the crowd
Fucked a habenero, not a mild
She was well endowed and hella loud when I gouged
It was a wild night, I swung ‘em at every light
Was doin’ shit you can’t do, every night
I drank, hurled, drank some more
Hit the dank, did the furl, hit the dank some more
I was buttered like a biscuit, pulled me a Triscuit
Ritz crackers everywhere, cuddy you missed it

[Hook: Husalah]
Aye yo, tell me one thing baby
Do you wanna wild out and go crazy?
Pull your rack out quick and get nasty
While I dip in my low like a gangsta
I pull my chop out, clear the parkin’ lot out
With your girl in my whip givin’ mop out
Now get real loose baby, go crazy
It’s a wild night we all crazy
Bitch!

[Verse 3: Fed-X]
Out the door, guess who? It’s the Mob Figaz
Kicks taped up, 50 states the ho getta
Mista pusha, mush ‘em all on the block again
Shake cops and then back to the motel
Fuck ‘em all, let them hand you the whole rail
Go to jail, cop bail, it never fails
It’s the God, Fed DeBiase, the mob
Money over bitches, get rich and get robbed
Soft in the pot, cook it up ‘cause it’s hot
Let it cool off, I got coke for coke rocks
I’m classy, I’m too jazzy, I let the world spin
And let ‘em all grin, I pose like the dope game
Tricks call him the king of the whole thing
Doors swing out the car, let the chain hang
I’m so flossy and glossy, I dumb bet
It’s buck fifty in a million dollar concept

[Hook: Husalah]
Aye yo, tell me one thing baby
Do you wanna wild out and go crazy?
Pull your rack out quick and get nasty
While I dip in my low like a gangsta
I pull my chop out, clear the parkin’ lot out
With your girl in my whip giving mop out
Now get real loose baby, go crazy
It’s a wild night we all crazy
Bitch!

[Verse 4: Rydah J. Klyde]
Wild nights, two fights and not a fist thrown
Four-fifths, two got hit from clips this long
It was probably over a bitch, so they get the strip song
Who won with two dead, and the other snitched on?
Somebody got that bitch from the stripper to a thong
Somebody on the strip gettin’ money, but you gone
It’s the same ass song, but I ain’t gon’ sing along
I’m tryin’ to find a Nia Long lookalike
Took her right home, unplugged the phone
Muffled the moan, with the panties that she just had on
Tied her hands with the bra, she wanted it raw, I’m tellin’ her naw
And bitch quit tryin’ to climb up the wall
Shit, I deserved an applause, but I ain’t gon’ brag
Just break down the bag, watch the bitch hop back on my balls
Sip on this yak, and play with my mac ain’t trustin’ a rag
Cause I may have to shoot it up in my drawls

[Hook: Husalah]
Aye yo, tell me one thing baby
Do you wanna wild out and go crazy?
Pull your rack out quick and get nasty
While I dip in my low like a gangsta
I pull my chop out, clear the parkin’ lot out
With your girl in my whip givin’ mop out
Now get real loose baby, go crazy
It’s a wild night we all crazy
Bitch!
