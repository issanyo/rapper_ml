[Mac Dre Talking]
C'mon
Let's do it
What it is
Thizz is what it is
Another knocker
Kick this game around like soccer

[Verse 1]
Pull up a chair let me make you a plate
Of this game that's seasoned like a tasty steak
Since '88 I've been serving them well
I was serving yayo when L was Rocking Bells
Clocking mail, get, get, getting it
Copping it, flipping it, flip, flip, flipping it
Now I'm spitting it bar for bar
European whipping it car for car
No dough, hoe? You know I say no
I need you like Jaws need a rain coat
I fandangoes, stay high as the Star Spangled
Choke the blood out you, bitch, get strangled
Get mangled fucking with this pimpin'
Hot as Lipton, Dre Jay Simpson
You better pay attention, it's all gamed up
Peep the bio, the file, see how I came up

[Hook]
Since '84 I been out there gettin' my dough
In the Sco the O and Valley Jo
Getting rich in the Rich and San Jo
Grinding and rhyming and pimpin' hoes
Rolling on vogues and 2-4s
Dre Tripper gotta stay with two hoes
Stay with zippas, boy, I keep a few O's
Get bossed and say 'thar she blows!'

[Verse 2]
When I sweat her I say 'read my lips'
Bring me cheddar, bitch, bring me chips
Fingertips, ass, hips and lips
Follow my lead, don't ask questions bitch
I want fresh fits from Abercrombie & Fitch
When it's going down, the Mac comes and shits
The Mac comes to spit
Let me do it to your ear baby
I'm trying to flip, see I do it every year baby
Real off the laddish, getting my cottage
Cheese, geez, please, beez, freeze
Stop it, you're heading down the wrong path
Fuck making love, bitch, I want a tongue bath
Dumb cash, can you do it like me?
Cash a fat check at the bank with no I.D
Can you blow by me when I'm doing 100?
Smacking, slapping in my 500

[Hook]
Since '84 I been out there gettin' my dough

Getting rich in the Rich and San Jo
Grinding and rhyming and pimpin' hoes
Rolling on vogues and 2-4s
Dre Tripper gotta stay with two hoes
Stay with zippas, boy, I keep a few O's
Get bossed and say 'thar she blows!'

[Verse 3]
I got cutthroat friends and lots of women
I ride in a Benz but I'll squat a lemon
I want a stuffed turkey with all the trimmings
To pay and play extra innings
I'm winning, fat lady start singing
I'm finna get the Cougnut and start swinging
Skeet, dance and eight
And when they run my plates, model and make
I'mma shake, like I'm riding with a cake
Pedal to the metal, rarely hit the brake
I love a high-speed getaway
They wanna get rid of Dre, put the kid away
What I'm in today, I'm in the 7 series
So quiet you can't even hear me
Engine, when I smash the gas
And would you look at all that wood on the dash
