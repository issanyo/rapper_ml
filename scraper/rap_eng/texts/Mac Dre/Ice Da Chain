[Intro: Mac Dre]
Unlreased track that ain't nobody knew that Mac Dre did?
Yup
All this shit brand new
So I fuck with it then

[Verse 1: Mac Dre]
My lips is like feet
Jump on the beat like a trampoline
I got heat, nigga, gasoline
Rampoo, all in one body
Cutthoat, put a whole clip, all in somebody
I know gradibah, trust her a lil bit
Get sweated by the cops, just for some lil shit
S'finna spill this shit, get it outta me
Come straight for my pulmonary artery
Camaraderie, love for my comrades
They tote tough thangs and they ready for combat
That's right, I'm bad, I'm bad
And you mad 'cause I got the bitch that you had
That's too bad, nigga, step ya' game up
Ice ya chain up, puttin' ya thang up
Run ya gang up, lead 'em off the cliff
Smell that? Nigga, get a whiff

[Hook: Vellquan]
Ice ya chain up, gather ya gang up
She call me with no doe, I hang up
So sav, do it all when we run around
Hoes know strip down when we come around
We make chips off this gift that we cursed with
Every time we do it, we do it with a purpose
Whatchu mad at, man, I'm a class act
Count stacks while I hit baby from the back

[Verse 2: Mac Dre]
No need to get meaner
Oscar my Weiner
Yeah, 'em was tight
But she coulda came cleaner
I don't play, nigga, I'm Mac Dre
I drop two albums on one day
I'll pop two niggas with one K
I'll knock two bitches and they won't stray
You ok? Lame, I'm the man
I know this game like the back of my hand
I call a grand an Iraqi soldier
Never sober and don't get pulled over
From October to the end of September
I touch more mail than a return to sender
Stamp, my camp is nothin' but mean men
Ballers, shotcallers and kingpins
I'm nutty, dummy, trippy and psycho
And I just saved money switching to Geico

[Hook: Vellquan]
Ice ya chain up, gather ya gang up
She call me with no doe, I hang up
So sav, do it all when we run around
Hoes know strip down when we come around
We make chips off this gift that we cursed with
Every time we do it, we do it with a purpose
Whatchu mad at, man, I'm a class act
Count stacks while I hit baby from the back

[Verse 3: Yukmouth]
A base with me, guaranteed three G's
You get the playa price if you fuckin' with E.B
My old school nigga, we was fuckin' with T.B
When I was just a boy in the hood like Eazy
But now I put that boy in the hood like Jeezy
I'm pimpin' ya breezy, bought me a G.T. on G.P
Still, nigga bang out them CD's
Niggas know I was real before they watch Treal T.V
Catch me over the stove
Turn a cola to O's
All day I'll make it snow like the Poconos
We can blaze up the pipe or snort it up your nose
We got it sewed, the S.O. to the Valley Jo's
Roll the six fever, o'beamer
With that four-four heater
Yuk stuntin' like coat zebras
All them stop and goes
Ready to lock and load
All my life my niggas ghost walk the load

[Verse 4: Dubee]
I told 'em, yes I am
Ambit of the mothafuckin' man
I'm right there in my D-boy steed
Hip to hands, turn bricks to grams
So sav, do it all when I run around
Fuck with wizzle, BRRRAA, how the gunna sound
We gon' stunt it out
Dipped in butter now
So when I run her down, show off from the gutter pal
Nigga, now, bitch, what's what, get me
From Yuk and a bitch to bump, yup
I'm Buddy Love, ain't no Mister Klump
Boy, I'll whip the snuff and move zips to bumps
Yadda, I don't know, it's not miss enough
I'm the gutta puff don in all princess cut
Ay, quote this, bitch get bucked
So that bitch get biscuits, what
Bitch

[Hook: Vellquan]
Ice ya chain up, gather ya gang up
She call me with no doe, I hang up
So sav, do it all when we run around
Hoes know strip down when we come around
We make chips off this gift that we cursed with
Every time we do it, we do it with a purpose
Whatchu mad at, man, I'm a class act
Count stacks while I hit baby from the back

[Outro: Vellquan]
Count stacks while I hit baby from the back
You know the life line, niggas, it's a class act
Daddy of the hood
Vellquan
