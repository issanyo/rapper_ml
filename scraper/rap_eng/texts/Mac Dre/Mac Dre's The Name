Ayy, Whats goin on,It's your partner back in here
One more time
Servin it, cuz you deservin it
Ya know I've been gone for a long time
Put it down somethin special

The game I spit is fat like Oprah
Got more soul than deep fried Oklah
Dope like China White
Not like dynamite
Blowin up the spot cuz dude, I'm kinda tight
Raps flow fat like beer from cake taps
Slap them saps and give dabs to big mac
Seasoned veteran this game I'm indulgin
Pockets bulgin from bankin trojans
Love my grip but don't trip off ghetto freaks
Kill for skrill but chill deep in them ghetto streets
Dodge and duck when police chase me
Sharp as Fuuuck, cuz OGs lately
Me and my mic is like gin and soko
Dunk and yako
Foot in sock oooh, you didn't know
Well peep this mane
And recognize Mac Dre is the name
I step to the mic with intent to lace those
Who lack the nack to mac stack and break hoes
I come raw
But keep it oh so real
I got the kind of game to make a female kill
And I go deep up in some chassey
Doggy style like that mutt called lassey
They all chase me, like cat chase mice
And I play them, like fools play dice
I'm what is known as the play B-O-Y
Some people trip cuz Dre be so fly
I stay dipped like them fools from G-Qs
Step into the party and they all say he's cool

[Hook]

My lyrical content is deep like a good book
I serve flavor, just like a good cook
Grab a mic and ill at a party
Rap so good I send chills through your body
Rhyme style
Tight like coochie, rolled like sushi, funky like voot said
And top notch is what they rate Dre
Cuz I got more rhymes than food at Safeway
So make waaay
For the M-A-C
As I put the Crest Side on the M-A-P
I got more game than that fool cat, say Jack
I'm a G, a player from waay back
Skill superior, far from inferior
Got the pimp shell with the gangsta interior
And with the broads I'm smooth as suave son
And when it's funk I get the job done
So don't underestimate the great Mac
Cuz I make raps, and pimp to make laps
I hate saps
Can't stand a smurf, definition of smurf
Sucka mark in a church
I purr
Off cavasi yak
Slightly heated with a gram on yeah
Never hesitate to put game in a tight rap
Mac Dre is the name, and I like that

[Hook]
