[Intro]
To the double R all my time is given
To the double R
To the to the to the double R
All the double R
To the to the double R


[Verse 1 Coolio Da'unda'dogg]
9-2 man
91 was a long one
A sad one, a bad one
Or should i say a wrong one
The mac got killed
Bitches got pilled and shit
Jacking stacking a fat
Packing a gatt
Wearing silk n' shit
Times got crazy nigga's went wild
Or recession just depressing
You thing i give a fuck child please
Am trying to get my G's
Every night on my knees
Praying before i get my Z's
Cause at ease ain't how am feeling
Am ready for the killing
So i get me an O-Z and start dope dealing
Rocks to the fiend
Then me n' the crew fell out
I got the hell out quick
Thinking my mamma did i bell out, shit
Am stuck like chuck mad as fuck
And Down on my luck
So a nigga know he gotta come up
Be strong and move along
So ding dong down
But i ain't going out
So i'm about the come around
To my senses nigga
No longer a senseless nigga
I got defences nigga
Thats get my riches
Pulling my bitches
Telling the crew i love em' fool
Living a life
And giving a try to shop?
Because they hella cool
My nigga got locked up and also got jocked
But shit these days create crazy ways
I guess it's california livin'
So to the diggity double R
Nigga all my fucking time is given

[Verse 2 Mac Dre]
Yea coolio i know times are ruff
Steady on the grind cause theres never enough
Motherfuckers jacking and they blame it on me
Got my motherfucking peoples even thinking it me
Attorney bills take a big chunk of my bank
To get through the day i keep fucking with dank
On the crest side streets all day i strive
Often drifting of reminiscing of mic
Hoes on my dick like rats on cheese
Am steady saying no
She steady saying please
Six foot one
Slim and fly
Love slanging that j-i-m-m-y
Ya put the D to the I to the C to the K
And thats all you get from young mac ass dre
The lyrical rap speaking
Never be getting weaken
Continue to spit the pimping shit
And keep the fans peaking
The Twenty-four and then some
Cock am always in some
Love to spit a rap
Shoot some craps and try to win some
Cold cash money
Some mothafucking duckets
Sometimes I roll lit
Sometimes a ride a bucket
Got a cuddy named truck-it
I make the hoe's suck it
Don't jerk jerk jerk it, I fuck fuck fuck it
Keep my pants cuffed, my zig zags stuffed
The riggity romp life I could never get enough of
Peep game and let the shit soak man
I got the dope and I don't slang coke man
Cold kicking it loving how im living
And to the double R all my time is given
