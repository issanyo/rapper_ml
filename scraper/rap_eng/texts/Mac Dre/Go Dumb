[Verse 1: Sauce]
Get stupid, go dumb, yeah, that's our clique
I gives a fuck if u a dime, I still call you a bitch
You'll probably see us in the club 30 deep equipped with clips
And hella whips outside talkin' shit
We don't pay to get in nothin', rush the door so quick
21 with no sense, security guard so tense
'Cause we hyphy, ain't no tellin' what we might do
The light bright red but we still slidin' through
Hypnotiq got me cool, pills, popped about two
We done smoked about a quarter now already, what it do
I don't know about you but I'm feelin' myself
Whoa, let me calm down, i'm killin' myself
No, I get stupid so I gotta keep on
I could last about a week long 'til my battery gone
Six hours then I'm charged and I'm back in the zone
Back in the zone, get stupid, show 'em how we actin' at home

[Hook]
Get stupid, go dumb (Repeat 8X)
We some stunnas, y'all some runnas
Now get stupid, go dumb
Get stupid, go dumb (Repeat 3X)

[Verse 2: Yukmouth]
Nigga, I'm swingin' my Chev', you shakin' your dreads, get stupid
I'm makin' my bread, I'm shakin' the feds, get dumb
You makin' a spread and takin' ya meds, you stupid
I'm bussin' they head and bussin' my lead, I'm dumb
Fuck a club, nigga, I'm a thug nigga with drug dealers
Mug niggas, middle finger up screamin' 'Fuck niggas'
What, nigga? You from what? I gives a fuck, nigga
Run up on Yuk and get bucked, I'll have you touched, nigga
You ever see a thousand killas bum rush niggas?
And see 20 bitch niggas get stomped nigga?
Get jumped, clips dumped, leave ya slumped, nigga
Body in a dump, nigga; you don't want no funk, nigga
I get stupid like I'm mentally disturbed, smokin' herb
Swingin' a Suburb, stash full of birds
I rock minks, furs, and shit you never heard
And 20 Bay niggas on stage going berserk

[Hook]
Get stupid, go dumb (Repeat 8X)
We some stunnas, y'all some runnas
Now get stupid, go dumb
Get stupid, go dumb (Repeat 3X)

[Verse 3: Mac Dre]
When I step up in the club, I get hyphy, be like what
I cut it up, fuck it up, stuff it up, roll it up, puff it up
Boy, I'm tryna bust a nut, holla at baby, what's wit' it
She fucks wit' it, I'll thrust and then get sucked and bucks wit' it
I'm nuts wit' it, stupid, D-U-M-B
And MD keep a bitch broke like Huey MC
I'm a P-I-M-P, straight up out the V
The Bay, Morris Dre, ain't nobody bad like me
Nobody sav like me, I keep the Cutthoatish
You ain't notice, punk bitch, I'm the coldest
Here, roll this, it's drugs for the rich
No chips? I ain't got no love for the bitch
I'm a thug for the chips, bitch get my Frito Lays
Swoop, cutty bro show 'em your estupido ways
I see them Gucci, them J's, Stuey is how we come
Bust a lung, nigga, get stupid, get dumb

[Hook]
Get stupid, go dumb (Repeat 8X)
We some stunnas, y'all some runnas
Now get stupid, go dumb
Get stupid, go dumb (Repeat 3X)
