“And my number one rule is run up through it”

[Verse 1]
Cold rhymer, big timer
You can search but I doubt you’ll find a—
Nother MC, like me
The A-the N-the D-the R-E
Straight Mac, man, never would I love a hoe
A little hard but a fly young brotha though
Taking you home, baking your dome
It’s like that because I gets my cock on
Spittin’ the game, livin’ up to my name
Some real dope shit but it’s not cocaine
Not the type of guy, the type of nigga
That smokes weed but would never smoke a ciga—
Rette, and I’ll bet, I’ll put a sucker in check
Pop him up then jet, ‘cause that’s what he get
Tryna fuck, with young Mac ass Dre
Straight hoggin’ on mine, so stay out my way
‘Cause I set my goal and I’m making my move
I want every damn body in a Mac Dre groove
I’m cold as hell, nothin’ nice
Mac Dre, baby, livin’ a Mac’s life

And I’m livin’ a Mac’s life
“And my number one rule is run up through it”

[Verse 2]
M-A-C D-R-E
Nothin’ muthafuckin’ N-I-C-E
Dope rhyme maker, bitch breaker
I could toss a freak, take her money then shake her
Young playa, fly to the park
Not the big pimp, I play the player’s part
You know, maxin’ and relaxin’, catchin’ action
Make a dope rhyme, put it on wax and
Let it hit the street, so you could peep
A dope ass rhyme to a dope ass beat
Mac Dre, baby, the most rappable
Fly MC from the big Mac capital
Gettin’ the grit, spittin’ the shit
Making a hit, man, I just can’t quit
Romper Room joker, weed smoker
Don’t smoke joints, boy, I smoke choker
Rap ace, Mac in the place
Biters try to bite and can’t hang with the taste
Of these, fresh beats wit’ a Mac Dre touch
Now tell me am I dope (Pretty much)

And I’m livin’ a Mac’s life
“And my number one rule is run up through it”

[Interlude]
Yeah, I’m livin’ a Mac’s life
Getting zested, never fully rested
Yeah, getting at all the females with no details allowed
We gets our cock on, you know
Down and dirty about ours in the CCC…
Yeah, I’m livin’ a muthafuckin’ Mac’s life

[Verse 3]
Wanna rock a microphone so fresh
From the Crest, baby, oh yes
It’s the capital D-R-E, baby
From the nikky-nikky-Northside of the V
Down and dirty and nothin’ nice
Catchin’ more cot than a cat catch mice
Not a pimp, but it’s in my blood
I’m a muthafuckin’ Mac from the Country Club
That’s where I kick, get zested and shit
In the CCC is where I stack a grip
‘Cause money come, and money go
But a nigga like me make money grow
Cash and cot is on my mind
And if I’m not thrustin’ I’m on my grind
‘Cause I’m a Mac and that’s how I do it
My number one rule is run up through it
If there’s mackin’ to be done then I get to it
‘Cause I’m livin’ a Mac’s life, I thought you knew it

I’m livin’ a Mac’s life
I’m livin’ a Mac’s life
“And my number one rule is run through it”
Livin’…livin’…livin’…livin’…livin’ a Mac’s life
Livin’…livin’…livin’…livin’…livin’ a Mac’s life
My name is Mac Dre and I’m livin’ a Mac’s life

Yeah, Mac Dre, livin’ a Mac’s life
Pullin’ hoes, wearing the freshest clothes
Slammin’ them mob shot doors
“And my number one rule is run up through it”
And I’m livin’ a Mac’s life
“And my number one rule is run up through it”
