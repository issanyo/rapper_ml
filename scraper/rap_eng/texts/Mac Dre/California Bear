[Mac Dre]
I'm a roper smoker, love to yoke the chevy when I'm ripter.
Used to post up on the block with dope I got from victor
I go nuts, do doughnuts, when I'm full of that liquor
Get ho bucks, man so much, I ran game and pimped her.
My thang-thang got twisters, two sets like sisters
Davins and choppers, theres no stopping mister
A California bear, all up in your ear
While I'm playing in your hair, bitch I'm a player.
It ain't fair, niggas like me is rare
Hard to find, you night not find one like me anywhere.
You could search tall trees, the bottom of the seas
NIGGA PLEASE! they don't
Make em' like these!
HUH? Whatchu say? You gon' do what?
I love dat' get further in my coognut
Geek side shit up! In the streets I grew up
I run wit' niggas that'll peel a nigga for a few blunts
I'm sewing things up, got the game on lock!
I'll give you an E for effort, but that ain't no knock!
Man this thang don't stop, I'm all night like Denny's
I'm countin' thow-wow's while you're scapin for pennies
I'm tight like two hemmies, dope like to two grimees
Put a dub in the blunt cuz I don't like them skinny
Mafia like Vinny, a ovi and some some remy
Play boy from the bay boy, Sav lav you hear me?
