Hustlers, cum guzzlers, come ride on these nuts

Fuck what a cheap nigga holler, I'm taking the dough
I'm hollering twosome, the gambler, the slick type, snitch type, weed like
All up in a bitch nigga D. Rice

Keep her packed petty, lay the puss and get to swallow duck
Drinking the puss keep my pocket stuffed

Hook my celly up, pick me up in the clean Q45

Soft as cotton, booty big ass Stockton

Do what I say, plain and simple
No arguing, 'cause I R-U-N
The whole show, I let a hoe know
If she don't feel me, I will get felt
When I tell a breez-nitty to get my belt
Skimpy thongs make her love the song
She will hit a Backwood, but she love a bong
