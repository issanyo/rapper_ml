[Intro: Richard Pryor]
I don’t mess around. I had about four womens in my life. That’s right, ‘cause they drain ya. They do; they fuck all the time. That’s right; if you fuck one of ‘em good, you in trouble. ‘Cause she gon’ tell her friend, she gon’ want some. That’s right; and you fuck her, she gon’ tell somebody. And the next thing you know, you got to fuck eight or nine times

[Verse 1: Mac Dre]
Now how much money can one black man make
When his game be great and seasoned like a tasty steak
No limit, I’m in it to hold loot
Collectin’ scrill like that Golden Gate toll booth
Old schoolin’ like La-Di-Da-Di
Stickin’ long donk in every hole in a bitch body
She lick pipe, but never would I taste walls
Catchin’ more hoes than Mike Piazza catch balls
Mac Dre, I keep hoes droolin’
Ragooey, still old schoolin’
’71 glass house with that white interior
Blowin’ big bomb, drinkin’, rhyme superior
151 ways I get dumb
For every ten times she cum I bust one
I got stamina, I fuck ‘til the rooster crow
Put them legs up and let me goose ya, hoe

[Chorus 4X]
Hoes…love it

[Verse 2: Spice 1]
Bossalini, it’s the muthafuckin’ thug in me
I got a gangsta bitch pushin’ all my drugs for me
Fuck ‘em then get in my Benz, rob their old boyfriend
Nigga gotta stay strapped with Desert Eagles, .44s, Mac-10s (Blaow!)
Show her how to pull the trigger
Talkin’ to this thick ass bitch like she my potna, my only nigga
Another way to get the lucci
Is to hide these ki’s up in your muthafuckin’ coochie
Extra Large in the heezay, with Mac Dreezay
Put the mac playa shit down up in the Teezay
Bitch come and go on this lick with me
Born Killers like Mickey and Mallory
You in love with a fugitive
Bounty hunters on my dick, no clues to give
Got a muthafucka dodgin’ the pigs but I’mma stay at your crib
So we can fuck on the table and barbecue us some ribs

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Mac Dre]
You never met a nigga like me
The M to the D from the CCC, I’m a G
Colder than 40s fresh out the freezer
Doper than a muthafuckin’ quarter-piece’a
I got game that make hoes go get it
Funkier than two fat hoes that just shitted
On the same toilet, don’t spoil it, it’s all gracious
Keep hoes tied up like shoelaces
Mac Dre, boy, that playboy that hoes love
If your hutch act dumb, I’m gon’ shove
You can run up if you really wanna see Dre
But I don’t give a F-U-C-K
I take wives, lives, whenever it get funky
Ask your baby mama, nigga, I got donkey
Gon’ be in the Caddy when I’m in that babby
She askin’, “Mac Dre, would you be my daddy?”

[Chorus]
