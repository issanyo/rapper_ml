[Hook: Mac Dre]
We outta control
Popping off the premises
Gone off English's, suckel, fuck some Guinness's
20-inch wheels, pills, pocket full of bills
Hoes in heels, we all some pimp Ron O'Neals

[verse 1: Mac Dre]
It don't get no realer, scrilla getta, killa nigga
The way I figure, a killa nigga get it bigger
M-O-N-E-Y, I get it big
XO Remy, fly, I need a bitch
It's Me, MD, your Three-C cuddie
For a three C cuddie, I leave the whole scene bloody
Mac'n, jackin', stackin', rappin', that's how I get it
It don't matter how it happen, if it's cash I'm wit' it
Smoov-E move me to a better location
This nigga sitting on racks and you know I'mma take em
Ain't no faking, I keep it on the real
It's young Mac Dre, nigga, dope as a coke deal

[Hook: Mac Dre]
We outta control
Popping off the premises
Gone off English's, suckel, fuck some Guinness's
20-inch wheels, pills, pocket full of bills
Hoes in heels, we all some pimp Ron O'Neals

[Verse 2: Smoov-E]
Dirty deals, pills, the ones that try to steal
It's real, I got that cannon backed up on my heel
Persuasive appeal is going for 300
And better believe OE's gonna keep the streets flooded
I keep it budded, 2-foot bongs, gone, up all night long
Hoes in thongs, and macs who bump these gangster songs
We outta control...dirty deeds
We fucking hoes oh so tremendously
Orange zags or packed up in dime bags (little bags)
I love big head bills and stay away from the ones I already had
It's bad, Mac D-R-E
I tried to shake em' but these hoes is straight stuck on me
It's E

[Hook: Mac Dre]
We outta control
Popping off the premises
Gone off English's, suckel, fuck some Guinness's
20-inch wheels, pills, pocket full of bills
Hoes in heels, we all some pimp Ron O'Neals
