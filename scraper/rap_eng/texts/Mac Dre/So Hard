[Hook]
Times are getting so hard
I've always got to bogart
I love the shine so all the time I grind and rhyme and flow hard
I used to ride them go karts
Now I'm riding show cars
Ho's jock when I ride the block, hop in mine and out of your car

[Verse 1: Mac Dre]
Make a beezy blow hard
Just like my neezy Tomar
Take this pimpin' so far
Might catch me down in your car
I don't fuck with no marks
Baby sell them ho parts
Feel it when I spill it girl, let me get to your heart
You say you don't want no part
Because you done heard I blow cars
Don't listen to them bomarks
They just some hating ho sharks
I'm so scarred and came so far
Sometimes when it's sunny, girl, it rains so hard
Oh lord, don't let me kill no mo
Don't make me have to steal for a mill no mo

[Hook]
Times are getting so hard
I've always got to bogart
I love the shine so all the time I grind and rhyme and flow hard
I used to ride them go karts
Now I'm riding show cars
Ho's jock when I ride the block, hop in mine and out of your car
Times are getting so hard
I've always got to bogart
I love the shine so all the time I grind and rhyme and flow hard
I used to ride them go karts
Now I'm riding show cars
Ho's jock when I ride the block, hop in mine and out of your car

[Verse 2: Mac Dre]
I'm forced to pack a pistol
Pimp crackers like Nabisco
I mack in San Fransisco
Just like I'm macking this flow
I never blow the whistle
Nigga, it's official
Down to ride when the sides collide I'll blap you with my missile
When you let that bitch go
I'mma make that bitch ho
And we gon' get that big dough
From Queens and Sacramento
I rap to instrumentals
While macking baby mental's
Pack a chrome 40 with a red dot on me
Weapon and utensils
My game is sweet as mentos
I'm riding baby's dentals
I've been running game on broads since fools was sliding pencils
Staying on my ten toes
Stomping like some insoles
They copy me like Kinko's
When they see me in my clean clothes
Perpetrating, duplicating, imitating, pimpatrating
All ways hating, can't relate, now you're hater congregating
Won't hate a domination, but man it's combination
Of this gangster and this pimp, man he gon' rock the nation

[Hook]
Times are getting so hard
I've always got to bogart
I love the shine so all the time I grind and rhyme and flow hard
I used to ride them go karts
Now I'm riding show cars
Ho's jock when I ride the block, hop in mine and out of your car
Times are getting so hard
I've always got to bogart
I love the shine so all the time I grind and rhyme and flow hard
I used to ride them go karts
Now I'm riding show cars
Ho's jock when I ride the block, hop in mine and out of your car
