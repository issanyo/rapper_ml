[Miami Talking]
Real big up in this bitch
Stupid doo doo dumb, gorilla milk in It
And I'm talking to you niggas that's happy
As a faggot in a tree full of dicks
It's one love, to nobody, what's really going on
One love to nobody, stupid doo doo dumb
We at the party, unnh, let's kill em off
Dre & Mall make a bitch cough

[Verse 1: Mac Dre]
It started on a bright morning in 1997
I was in my SS Chevy y'all, I-80 doing one-eleven
Barking on my faulty phone, fresh new fit Maurice Malone
Burning tongue, feeling hella numb
Stupid doo doo dumb off 151
Honking at every ho that pass me
I'm hella nasty, boy, I need chassis
I'm the type of brother that'll fuck your mother
With a Magnum rubber and leave it on the cover
I won't love her, aw naw
All a nigga want is long jaw
It goes down where I'm from
How we come?
Stupid doo doo dumb

[Hook: Mac Mall]
When your chassis getting nasty playing with her pearl tongue
Stupid doo doo dumb, stupid doo doo dumb
Four fingers in a pussy, cuddie, gone use your thumb
Stupid doo doo dumb, stupid doo doo dumb
When you're hitting it from the back and you smell sometin' sometin'
Stupid doo doo dumb, stupid doo doo dumb
Or when she's slurping on my dick and she starts to hum
Stupid doo doo dumb, stupid doo doo dumb

[Verse 2: Mac Dre]
This is a brief description for those who don't know Dre
I'll go bad on bitches like that nigga OJ
Dick down broads and get blew at the telly
And don't see nothing wrong, like that fool R. Kelly
I serve cock like Julian St. Jox
Asshole naked getting blew in my socks
I'm the type of nigga that do thangs to thick dames
A super freak like that man Rick James
Adina Howard couldn't Freak Like Me
When I was in the pen, I used to beat my meat
But now I'm on the street hitting hella skins
Fuck a bitch so good she got to tell her friends
Tearing shit up making noise'n, with d-Con, that hoodrat poison
From city to city, town to town
Stupid doo doo dumb is how we get down

[Hook 2: Mac Mall]
When you're in your own hood and they ask you where you're from
Stupid doo doo dumb, stupid doo doo dumb
Dick longer then my Caddy off 151
Stupid doo doo dumb, stupid doo doo dumb
Another hit of this shit and you gon' bust your lungs
Stupid doo doo dumb, stupid doo doo dumb
When the babby hella flammy, can't make a playa cum
Stupid doo doo dumb, stupid doo doo dumb

[Verse 3: Mac Dre]
I'm hotter than fish grease, slicker than thick grease
A chump on the strap, I'll serve him a six-piece
Slick with this shit like spit on a gold tooth
Stupid Doo Doo Dumb, when I spit it's the cold truth
Crestsider, hoo rider, servin' on suckas who try to
Front with fake raps; man, I break backs
And I'll make snaps when I shake craps
Straight caps and lots of Bay game
'Cause it's a Bay thang with young Mac Dre, mayne
I say thangs that make your brain trip
Refrain from lame shit and some can't hang with
That game I bring and slang on dope tracks
I lace the lame and tame with ho slaps
I'm so fat, when I'm on the microphone
Stupid dumb making' em leave the mic at home

[Hook 3: Mac Mall]
When you off dog food and your nose start to run
Stupid doo doo dumb, stupid doo doo dumb
Fuck your sister so good that your mammy got sprung
Stupid doo doo dumb, stupid doo doo dumb
Headers when I first met her, all teeth, no tongue
Stupid doo doo dumb, stupid doo doo dumb
Crestsiders in the house, punk bitch, we on one
Stupid doo doo dumb! Stupid doo doo dumb!
