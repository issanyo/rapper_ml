[Intro: Mac Dre]
Yeah, yeah, I’m feeling real, you know, thuggish right now
Smashin’ fools way out here in Sebastopol
Yeah, Smoov-E, know you got the heat
Cannon—I know you got your cannon, homie
Yeah, Reek Daddy, I know you got your cannon, homie
Check this out

[Verse 1: Mac Dre]
I’m not your average neezy; I’m a pimped-out savage, beezy
Representer of the Crest streets, test Reek
Bet he get dumb with them big guns
Let’s flip the script, finna spit the shit
Make niggas trip and them bitches strip
Mac Driggedy, yo’ niggedy
Kick it in the V, look at me, I’m feelin’ free
No parole, I could choke a hoe
Get some mail, make bail and ain’t gon’ let me go
Please believe it, when she retrieve it
I’mma take it, break it, ‘cause she don’t need it
I’m a Mac, dog, I don’t act hard
We can go toe-to-toe in the backyard
Can’t you see I’m a G from the V-A-double L-E-J-O
More trees, getting cheese from a breezy
Take it easy, you hoe

[Hook: Mac Dre]
Cut it, stuff it, roll it, smoke it
A Chev’ ain’t shit if a nigga can’t yolk it
Romper Room crew, Smoov-E too
Bitch don’t trip off the things we do

[Verse 2: Smoov-E]
Stoned like Sly, sellin’ D like Stack
Multiple shanks just like Iraq
Like Dre say, “It’s all on a beezy”
Kick back off in the studio on a bleezy
Girl, don’t offer, I just might take one
Keep her friends close ‘cause I just might break one
Then touch my D, my D’s too heavy
Get black roses, at bed with the lead
Reek Daddy, oh so savvy
Hoes getting grabby, whip it like a Caddy
Cottonmouth is what I do
It’s that hash havin’ potna from Sebastopol
Rule, Number 1: drink your drank until you’re numb
Rule, Number 2: smoke all the weed and always fuck somethin’ new
I like my big green like Bruce Banner
The one that lives in the cuts with a hand cannon
Had the blunt in the rug, a hoe in the tub
And left a fingerprint in her purse, and I show no love

[Hook 3X: Mac Dre]
Cut it, stuff it, roll it, smoke it
A Chev’ ain’t shit if a nigga can’t yolk it
Romper Room crew, Smoov-E too
Bitch don’t trip off the things we do
