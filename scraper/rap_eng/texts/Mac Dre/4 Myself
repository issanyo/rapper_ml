[Hook]
I want you for myself
You can't have no one else
I want you for myself
You can't have no one else

[Verse 1: Dubee]
See I'm a cold polecat
I hope she know that
Shitty off the titty and dope as Prozac
Spit the anthrax, leave a dent in your brain
Please believe ain't no cuffing me mayne, fuck a dame
Trying to put her hooks in me, I go Bo Billy
Wanna get with me, let her dough get with me
Keep the big heads crispy, ducking it up
I do the dirt then I'm fucking it up
Bitch what the fuck is you hollerin'
Bitch check your noggin
Fore' I pull out the pecker then peck at your noggin
Sug don't go for that
Check the skully with the cutty off dosha sacks
Forty racks

[Verse 2: Devious]
I'm not the average dude although I'm digging you
I can't be tied down now I deal in ho's and brew
Money is all I need, a backwood and a bag of trees
P-I-M-P is me your wildest dreams between the sheets
I got to have my dough, like you don't know what I'm here fo'
You got to break mines off, like I do you when I'm with you
On Cutty Bang and Smirnoff we'll do the thing and I'll show off
I can't be locked down now, that's not how I get down

[Verse 3: Mac Dre]
The bitch is fatal
Plus she play all day like cable
I'm a pimp baby, I run a stable
I got H-O E-S's
High heels and cold gear is how she dresses
You too skrilla and I'm a true playa
You looking for a cuddle up, a Poo Bear
I need a bitch that's gonna move some work
Do some dirt, she can't then I ain't goosing her
I'm using her for her cards and her credit
She's breaded, super unleaded
Super saucy, super what you not
You need a man who ain't tripping off what you got
I'm too much meezy for one beezy
Plus, I like my nachos cheesy
That one on one shit, I can't go for that
I'm laid up with three bitches smoking fat

[Hook]
I want you for myself
You can't have no one else
I want you for myself
You can't have no one else
