Acid, booze, and ass, needles, guns, and grass
Acid, booze, and ass, needles, guns, and grass, lots of
There is a song for you
There is a song for you
There is a song for you
*stutter* There is, there is

[Verse 1: Mac Dre]
They say Benzes roll, Beamers jet, and Caddies keep on dippin'
Well, I must be trippin', I'm in a old-school pie flippin'
Sellin' them high, gyppin', tendin' to my pimpin'
Times slippin', late, I'm on my way
Not enough hours in the day to be Dre
I'm el presidente, I run tings
Tote gun things and never run from things
Braveheart but I'm not Mel Gibson
I'm dope like coke that was cooked in the kitchen
Dabbin' revolution, stab it and I'm goosin'
Mini-me laptops, many beats that knock
Lotsa hemp, lobster, not shrimp
Big prawns maybe, I pimps on baby
Always shoppin', no more hall moppin'
Hella Nikes with Gucci, hella nights with coochie

[Verse 2: PSD]
I tell baby play Casper
Be friendly ghost on 'em, after you host on 'em
She a team player, I play coach on 'em
Like a doobie in a joint, play roach on 'em
Won't smoke on 'em
If it ain't dollalala-lalala lotsa notes on 'em
C status, won't holla till it's G status
I'm cutthoat, Three-C savage
Whatever me want, me have it, see me lavish
Your trash might be cash, gimme that, bitch
Like lil mama in labor, I push puss
That's real talk, all scrill talk, cuz cuz
Rather fuck then cut
One G, ah nah, bitch, wasn't enough
And to this day, won't love, won't get paid
And for you, here a song like the bitch say

[Verse 3: Dubee]
Now, I could talk a bitch brain out her noggin
And slide across thin ice like toboggans
Wizzle be a fool 'fore we get to smobbin'
Bitch, quit sobbin', get a trick dick throbbin'
Now, you could be a sidekick like Batman and Robin
On all-star, pimp shit, that beat got her bobbin'
Her head, don't stop, like she keep on noddin'
And all I do is collect and sell the product
I knock a Baywatch bitch dipped in Prada
And still check all of it, every dollar
And I don't even call but they hear me holla
And yeah that bitch trained to run game on scholars
Get it for your father or don't even bother
A bitch circuits overload, I won't stop her
Bitch nonstop, hold up, robotic
And every piece of dough that bitch touch, I got it
