Un-fuckin-believable
Mac stabbas
Smile in your face
Stab you in the back
Mac stabbas
It's time to pull the sheets off these niggas main
You heard?

I done heard yo' tape, Mac; that shit is wack
Why the fuck you sellin' that?
You need to go back to sellin' crack
Take it from a nigga that done been to hell and back
Oh yeah, I forgot, you ain't sold a god damn crumb
You's a studio gangsta, chump
Where the fuck you from?
No love for the niggas that done laced your muthafuckin boots
Niggas that slaved, went to the grave for you
Niggas that ain't scared to shoot
You Gilligan ass nigga, I remember I was makin' your promos
Now you want to diss your real folks and chop it up with them homos
Like that nigga Khayree, you let that sissy cross game?
Salt me up usin' your name?
I guess it's just a ho thang
Y'all niggas killin' me, with all that gay shit
All y'all niggas came up, fuck that Mac Dre shit
Mark Mall, you need to be fucked up the bootyhole
Knowin' the first time you touched the mic was in my studio
You niggas must have forgot before I was bustin' raps and rhymes
I was on the track with a sack sippin' 'yack strapped with a gat and a nine
I've been to your house, I've seen your chrome
But you ain't gone bust a grape in Napa Valley with golf shoes on
A bitchmade nigga gets no love from a real G
Cuddies from the 3 C's,  I know you feel me
I should have known when I came home somethin' was wrong
Your own crew tried to have your dome
And just left that shit alone
Now you wanna fuck with a cutthroat nigga that been doin dirt
Since creased 5-0-1's, Chuck Taylors and them Izod shirts
Them 5-trey-5 niggas don't like you
Don't believe it, hop in your Jaguar, nigga, and slide through
You'll be lucky to leave the ghetto with just a leakin' lip
You feelin' froggish I'm feelin' hoggish, boy, we can slip
In granny backyard, then when you act hard
I'm a treat you like a Mac Bitch, Young Mac Mark
Young Black Brothas Records is a goddamn flop
Khayree needed to stop way back when his ass got dropped
From that major label, nigga had a major stable
But he shot himself in the head, boy, and the blow was fatal
God don't like ugly, boy, ask yo mama
Now everywhere you trav' you better have Usalama
Mac Mall gets no love, ask my nigga Dubee
He shook us for videos and pretty hoes and left us out his movie
That nigga left me for dead when I was doin' time in jail
Couldn't shoot a nigga nathan when he was havin' major mail
You's a back stabba or should I say a Mac stabba
Well, here's some Mac magic, nigga...abra cadabra
I just turned your ass into an official bitch
Fuck you and your cousin Gilla, dirty snitch
That fool got real niggas never comin' home
And that's the type of shit niggas like you condone
I used to have love for ya, I used to bust with ya
But now you done crossed game, nigga, I can't fuck with ya
