I'm quick to flip the script and transform like a Deceptacon
Dope as pharmaceuticals, drink Beautifuls at Caf√© Escalon
Love doja dank that make me choke burp and cough
'Cause I'm the type of nigga that like to smoke perk and toss
Use them Magnum rubbers baby, 'cause they be bigger than the rest
And in case you didn't know me homie I represent the Crest (sida)
Haters be mad at me, I pull bitches with flattery
Have the funk savagely, commit assault and battery
On any man, who think he can serve me some static
Got many friends with mini vans, with fully automatics
Love Evelyn Jones and boy I'm deadly playin' bones
Federales had me gone but now a nigga back at home, it's on
Lip poppin' no stopping panties droppin' left and right
Boy they be jock in, steady shoppin' for sex at night
Old school like Atari and I'm dope on my pen
We be M-A-C-D-R-E aka Silky Slim, from the V
Never drink Haterade, Armani suits tailor made
Quick to shake a blade, and broke bitches I'll never fade
Kick off your Air Maxes relax, just while I bust
'Cause thou shall not have stress, hutch shall not be trusted
Game spicy, like mustard rushed into your cerebellum
Super saucy ex-felon but there's still no tellin'
What that H-O might D-O on the D-low
So we go super hard on broads and play their ass like cards
Can you feel it, nothing can save ya
'Cause this is the season of licks and capers
Unemployment at a record high
People coming, people going who's next to die
I, stay ready with heavy macks and choppas
Tell me can you crack tonight, steady tryin' mack some cock
'Cause I'm a 3C Romp there in none higher
Did a fed in the pen cause a nigga wore a wire
But now I'm back, with crates of raps
Ready to break some backs and make fools face facts
Niggas walk around town, jealous with envy
'Cause I stay fitted and getting hoes infinity
Representin' Windy, Sage and Mark
Leonard, Soya Missen buggy and all
Peanut, Kendal, Kentay and Jack
Ta Ta, Torrence, PSD and Yak
Chuy, Mini eyes and Wayne Howard the dope fiend
Ray Shawn, Da Da, Mac Lee, and Highshadee
Green eyes, Neko, my homeboy Jay
Please don't hurt Baby Rock, Freak E Dee, Dant and Ray
