[Verse 1]
Uh
I'm always late, always on my way
Ain't enough hours in the day to be Dre
Cause in the Bay, things move fast
Stop to catch a breath, you might get passed
And that's yo ass, cause I'mma do it movin'
At 12 o' clock I'm supposed to meet Rubin
But I forgot, Rubin gotta wait
Cause I can't be late for me court date
For goodness sake I'm like "what the fuck?"
I'm noddin' out, I'm sleep standin' up
If I don't go sit my black ass down
I'mma fuck around and, fall down
What the feezy who tryin' to call now?
Oh I forgot, I'm supposed to be at the mall now
I got in-sto', if they knew what they was in fo'
24 hours in a day I need ten mo'

[Interlude]
Had to get clearance
Had to make sure it was cool first baby, the call from up top
??? is we cool?

[Verse 2]
I'm a federal hold nigga do shit that's unbail-able
Do it cutthoatish, unnoticed, untrailable
My bitch gon' make sure the funds are available
I'm a hot commodity, big business, I'm sellable
Infuckincredible, inedible
I'm married to the game so that makes unweddable
No wedding, no romantic setting
I mattress on the floor, no fancy bedding
Get it straight from the gate so you know where this thing is heading
Cold as the snow on the mountains of Redding
Everything she wanna do, I'm not letting
Work a race horse til her hair start shedding
I'm not regretting, the dirt I've done
A nigga wanna wet me I'mma squirt my gun
I need weed that's gon' hurt my lung
And chick with jaw that'll make me squirt my cum

[Verse 3]
I'm sorry to hear your situation has been worsening
Oh I can't complain, me myself personally
Tramp traffic is at all time high
I'm still stuntastic like I've been all my life
And how about wife, she's been hittin' me dog
I think she's considering gettin' me dog
She no longer cherish your marriage cause you financially embarrassed
Man I can take the bitch and go get mo' chips than Harrah's
No day off like Ferris, service is volunteer
By choice not force, it won't be no problems here
Man would guard your chick, she finna do somethin' slick
If she ain't ridin' mine she gon' be ridin' somebody else dick
Cause she tired of ya, done made a lie of ya
Toss her to a pimp, let me show you how I love her
I'mma get it out of her, every penny, every dolla
It's rent money, yanadadaholla

[Verse 4]
You lames missed it, got twisted like a pretzel
I'm a slick nigga cunning, gunning, running from the metro
I get so quick do it movin' bitch I'm federal
Respect it, connected get the stuff from the es√© Pedro
I'm a pimp you, but you wouldn't know I dress retro
Breathe life in a ho lung, get her sprung so she can't let go
Shoulda bet mo', scary nigga I'm winner
Eat a nigga for dinner, game strong as paint thinner
If I can't send her, than pimpin', I don't need her
All I need is one mic, my money, and my heater
I steal clientele, short stop like Derek Jeter
I'm ill for my mail will pop out the two-seater
My mouth is too heated, I'm outlawed in a few states
I come through in somethin' ooh, cleaner than you with new plates
Y'all niggas is fruit cakes, same sex marriages
I'mma cutthoat with cutthettes, strapped with derringers

[Verse 5]
Yep, you right, nigga how you know
Man pimpin' had to let that bitch go
She a dime tryin' to steal my shine
Told that bitch take a number, get yo ass back in line
You wastin' my muthafuckin' time
I'm the biggest thang since Sprite put lemon with lime
Have you lost yo muthafuckin' mind
You must don't know, bitch I'm the kind

[Verse 6]
(Man it's cold)
It's cold as the Swiss Alps
The people get on me, than homie I switch routes
Mac Dre stay cussin' a bitch out
Quarterbackin', like Dan Fouts or Tim Crouch
I'm stuntin', watchin' my scritch sprout
Pourin' some Cris out, partna I'm pimped out
Colder than a blizzard in Alaska, or Mount Shasta
In a mask a blast ya, my car fasta, I strike past ya
12 Volt posi, cam and Flowmasters
Keep it to yo'self partna, who asked ya
I teach the game, a preach but no pastor
I'm cold
