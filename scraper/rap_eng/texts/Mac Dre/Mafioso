[Mac Dre Talking]
Ugh
Wha, wha
What is it?
Yeah
Yadidaholla
Do you know whadddiholla (do you know what I holla?)
Yeah, the itty bitty city by the water
That's steady gettin taller
Vallejo
You hoe
You just don't understand
Check it out though

[Verse 1: Mac Dre]
Sippin' Martinis eatin scampi and linguini
Makin' blunts disappear, like I'm Houdini
Laid up with Asians that know tongue fu
Gettin' blew when I got the call from Young Dru
He was speakin thizzlamic but I can understand it
He said "Al Boo Boo, the eagle has landed"
My reply: 'Pronto, cousin
Execute stage two, put the turkey in the oven'
For those who don't know that means he got the blow
And it's time to turn the blow into more dough
Sell 'em high, buy 'em low, let 'em fly, let 'em go
Birdies of the snow straight from Valley Jo
Who got it? Nigga, Dru got it
And if you hit him on the hip, he'll make sure that you got it
Me and my team, we tryna win
And we keep it mafioso, you hear the violins

(The Godfather tune by Mac Dre)

[Verse 2: Young Dru]
I'm the yay boy, the playboy, from the Bay, boy
Where I stay, boy, we don't be puffin' no hay, boy
Where my son head lay boy, I protect with the K, boy
Run in my home and get sprayed, boy
Young Dru and Mac Dre, boy
The Yay don't play, boy
I'm a made boy highly connected spit flame, boy
I'm a paid, boy, spliffs of naid all day, boy
Never changed, I'm the same, so fuck what you say, boy
I'm not afraid, boy
Take it from wax to gunplay, boy
Run away, boy
Shakin' the blades and gay boys
Movin' bricks, boy
Choppin' down kicks to picks, boy
Weighin' zips, boy
Takin' them trips for chips, boy
Coppin' whips, boy
Floss, cross by chicks, boy
Makin' hits, boy
Fuck with the mob and get split, boy
Loaded and lit, boy
Dre and Dru is the shit, boy
From a fix to a bitch
We tryna get rich, boy

(The Godfather tune by Mac Dre)

[Verse 3: Mac Dre]
I'm in my sneaks with freaks on the beach was shallow
Bossed up drinkin' Ernest and Julio Gallo (wine)
I got my Roll-O, my butterfly knife
I'm nothin' nice, I cut a guy twice
All of my life I followed the path
A D-Boy, B-Boy, have cash, live lav'
Got game like Bob Costas, got dread like Rastas
Eatin' seafood sauce put over pastas
You imposters get tried for treason
To the Nation of Thizzlam is my allegiance
Write a grievance, file a complaint
Tell 'em Dre doin' things that them other guys can't
Burnin' rubber all day, drivin' wreckless
I cut a man throat, give a man a bloody necklace
Cuddie, they respect us 'cause they have to
My niggas mafioso, you prick, they'll whack you!

(The Godfather tune by Mac Dre)
