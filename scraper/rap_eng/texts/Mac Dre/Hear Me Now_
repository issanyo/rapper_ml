[Verse 1: Mac Dre]
I'm a different kind of human
You can catch me shroomin'
Drunk in the bucket, beats blasting and boomin'
Sound tuning while I'm clowning and cooning
Polo cologning while you nigga's perfuming
I'm connected with jew men, only fuck with a few men
Campaign with this game man, like Truman
Puffing a Cuban, fucking with Rueben
Stay in a trap bumping, just saying, where you been?
I'm grooving, moving with Gucci on my shoes
Braking then cruising, the coochie I'm abusing
I'm amazing, sometimes I'm amusing
I'll rake six sisters named Susan

[Hook: Mac Dre]
Can you hear me now?
Can you hear me now?
Can you hear me now?
Can you hear me now?
Can you hear me now?
Can you hear me now?
Can you hear me now?
Can you hear me now?

[Verse 2: Mac Dre]
I'm a Nike shoe wearer
Might key up with Sarah
Be all in a bitch face like some mascara
Nigga when I wear a, saucy fresh pair of
Gucci's, I'm a tennis shoe pimp on a terror
Got a beezy names Laura, replaced her with Farrah
She had a Carrara, she was well taken care of
No errors, runs or hits
Strikes I pitch, I swing for the fence
I'm mean in the clench
Tighten like a wrench
That nigga at the place? you don't like him I can pinch
I'm hyphy and convinced, hyphy and convinced

[Hook: Mac Dre]
Can you hear me now?
Can you hear me now?
Can you hear me now?
Can you hear me now?
Can you hear me now?
Can you hear me now?
Can you hear me now?
Can you hear me now?
