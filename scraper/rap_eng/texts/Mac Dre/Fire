(Where am I?
I smell fire)
Who got that fire
Fire?
I don't smoke that brown
(Fire)
I want the bomb
Don't like that shit
I don't like that shit
(Fire)
I need fire, who got fire?
(Fire)
Yo nucca
It's yo nucca
(Fire)
Roll somethin up
(Smoke it)
(Fire)
Roll somethin up
(Fire)

[Verse 1: Mac Dre]
I'm at the liquor sto' gettin' mo' blunts for the skunk
Hit the block in the Chev', I got thump in the trunk
Feelin' good off the 'woods in the hood and I'm thizzin
Kinda 'noid, they always tryin' to take your boy back to prison
They hate to see a player employ his self
They hate to see a player enjoy his self
But I'm sidin', wanna ride? Then player, let's go
I'm 29 with many rhymes and love XO
I'm a hog, bust a broad with the words I serve
Every tape that I make, baby, learn the words
Young Mac Dre got the gift to gab
Hate a breezy who give heezy like she lickin' some zags
I'm on the celly telly tryin to get some roper from Nelly
Need a derry smelly, finna go choke at the telly
It's on, finna blow a zone to the dome
Tone Capone got the bong and them bomb weed songs

[Chorus (Repeat 2X): (Harm) & Big Lurch]
(Fire)
Puttin the smoke in the air
(Fire)
Blowin big type of player player
(Fire)
Cheech and Chong on a spree
Blowin it big, come smoke with me

[Verse 2: Big Lurch]
Everyday in the life of a G
We be triflin' and we enlighten the seed
Niggas ain't likin' me
Them pimped out gangsterism tactics
Been all on my gun like a blacksmith
The midget, belligerent actor, see the chiropractor
But I crack ya neck, back, spleen
Blow you to smithereens for the things I done seen
In my everyday smokin-out ritual, regular routine
Walkin' down the street with a gangsta limp in denim jeans
Seein' some squaws and smile (bling-bling)
I just wanna lean
Why don't I juggle up this dope beat
Then jump in a five-point-O leavin' the block smoky
With the OG Mac Dre, Killa Kali parlay, parlay
Smokin' a bounce of that bombay every day
(Puttin' the smoke in the air, blowin' big type of player-player)

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Mac Dre]
I need narcotic, that gooey and stinky
When I ain't got it, I'm moody and cranky
What the dealy, what's really, bust down that Phillie
We can old school with a zag or blow bags in the billy
Is you silly, never throw the doobie away
Waste no dank when you're blowin' with Dre
Tryin' to cope with the stress so I blow big
How can a bulletproof vest protect my wig?
See, them cutthroat fools done changed the rules
The public got it twisted and we blame the news
I got game for fools 'cause I hang with fools
That got game to use and maintain the rules
Keep it real, dog, and represent what's right
Be a real hog when you bless the mic
Smoke big, live long and get yo' pringles
Young Lurch and Mac Dre makin' hit rap singles

[Chorus 2X]
