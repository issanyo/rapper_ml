[Chorus: Jill Scott]
I see your true colors, shining through
I see your true colors, that's why I love you
I see your true colors, shining through
I see your true colors, that's why I love you

[Verse 1: Fredro Starr]
Yo, father forgive, we all tryin' to survive where we live
I'd rather feed the homeless, take times and talk to the kids
Show 'em life ain't no walk on the bridge, damn as hard as it is
When I be dreamin' I be talkin' to BIG
In my hood it ain't no yellow brick road, we hear the shots echo
Sneakers hangin' from a telephone pole
In my ghetto ain't no rainbow wit pots a gold
But there was love from the family when times are cold
I seen and analysed the world from my project roof
And seen the hope in the eyes of a troubled youth
A good kid, I kept my burna in dis bubble goose
A motherless child lost in these streets loose
In the immortal words of Rae these are rainy days
My man got popped at an early age
His college fund saved up into his early grave
They say the good die young were headed for them pearly gates

[Chorus: Jill Scott]
I see your true colors, shining through
I see your true colors, that's why I love you
I see your true colors, shining through
I see your true colors, that's why I love you

[Verse 2: Fredro Starr]
They say this love wasn't meant to be
Two people from two different worlds, we wasn't meant to be
It musta been fate you were sent to me
We'll make it through these hard times eventually
Let's stand and fight, walk by faith and not by sight
We're all the same color when you turn out the lights
I take the sunshine with the pain
Grandma said when God sad, that's when it rains
No fridge, kept the food on the window pane
We all breathe the same air so we all the same
I'm trapped in this ghetto maze tryna make it out
If you don't know me don't judge me, wuthcu talkin' bout
I'm fathered by the boulevard of broken dreams
Single mothers y'all my heroes, y'all my queens
To get my moms out the hood that's my hope and dreams
To raise my son to be a soldier by any means

[Chorus: Jill Scott]
I see your true colors, shining through
I see your true colors, that's why I love you
I see your true colors, shining through
I see your true colors, that's why I love you

[Outro: Jill Scott]
