Go Rambo Go Rambo (Yo)

[Fredro]
Why you hating on fire niggas can't knock the game
Cause we let the top drop like the stock exchange
Click sitting on quarters like pocket change
Yo Ick trade the six for the Aqua Range
You can catch me testing toasters
Out the testarosta
Sparking Hershey in the nestle roster
I got a vest tech next to holster
Try to front get your face left next to posters
You ain't blasting at starr
Only you use a pump nigga
Is when you gassing your car (Ayo God)
I caught a ticket in my drop at the light
Cause my rims started speeding when I stopped at the light
Now chicks want to suck up
Car doors open like them shits getting stuck up
Cause it's a Lambo
And we chilling in the club and got more ammo than Rambo

[Chorus]
24's on the coupe boy
That's how we roll
On tour getting loot boy
That's how we roll
22's in the boot boy
That's how we roll
Not only guns, movie shoots boy
True boys
We stay wheeling' in the Benz ma'
That's how we roll
Yeah, I'm chilling' with my friends ma'
That's how we roll
You need to call your friends ma'
That's how we roll
And we can all get bent ma'
You get high?

[Ickarus]
You can catch Ickarus in the candy hummer
Trying to get Fredro to give me Brandy Number (OH)
We make it hotter than Miami summer
Feds taking flicks while Sticky hand me something
It's me and Fire in the Lamborghini  Mya
2 cats stay out in Brooklyn and Queens and Mayer
Rims doing cartwheels
Whip late spot
Team Bartwell
This The GMG cartel
Ick is a mobster
That is quicker to spark ya
Burn Bikes on the turn pipes
Lifting the Honda
What is you dealing with {Huh}
We all spilling clips (Huh}
If you filling this {Yea Ick you killing it}
It get realer when I feel em with six cases
Now I'm in LA six for when spinning Dayton's
I've been amazing
I was raised in a place where we blazing
But cause we caged in

[Chorus][Ickarus] {Switches up 2x}

24's on the coupe boy
That's how we roll
On tour getting loot boy
That's how we roll
22's in the roof boy
Not over chrome movie shoots boy
True boys
