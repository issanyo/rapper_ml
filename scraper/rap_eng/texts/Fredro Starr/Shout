Oh no not them, here they come!

[Fredro Starr]
Baldheads and guns blaw
Where you gonna run say ah, oh
Which way did he go? You don't know
You move too slow, boy you blow
My style grows on you like hair
Where my Queens niggas? We right here
Is you out there? Yeah

[Sonsee]
Just watch us spark this hit and get ill
We won't yield til we hit  50 bil
So grab a hold, get a grip, it's time to shake it up
For rappers and routines that make bricks

[Sticky Fingaz]
Amnesia couldn’t make me forget about where I came from
And even if I left the slum I’d still be a hoodlum
Cause good things come to those who take ‘em
And I'm fed up and filled with so much anxiety I gotta scream
To let out all this frustration that's built up inside of me

[Hook: 4X]
Come on and scream and shout, just let it all out

[Sonsee]
These M.C.'s shoulda rehearse
They keep comin around like auto-reverse
For them our shit’s the worst
We disperse and then they hurt
But first to cut, then I burst they verse to quench my thirst

[Sticky Fingaz]
I made mad money but I spent it, now I'm broke
So I'm searching for somebody to put in a chokehold
And I can't wait to wrap my bare hands around they neck
And squeeze until I fuckin strangle 'em to death

[Fredro Starr]
Yo, you smell that?
Yeah, that's me, I'm the shit
I'm in effect like WIC checks  and you a TEC without the clip
There goes my rhyme again, pass me my Heineken
Where’s the weed? I need it, it’s my vitamin
So light it then get high
Reach for the sky, you won't survive, you won't get by, you gotta die
Your style is a gimmick and you know that you can't be what we be
We Afficial Nastee Niguz

[Hook]

[Fredro Starr]
When I was born I never thought that I could be like that
Growing up in the back block, selling crack rocks to black cops
I pack, cock Glocks and clock phat knots
Nickel and dime, petty crimes, packing plenty nines and knives to stay alive
Surviving and getting mine
Thoughts of the ghetto minds said fuck the books
See I’d rather run the street and fuck around with the crooks
And got bigger and bigger and bigger and bigger and deffer and better
This is my bread and butter my brother word to mother

[Sonsee]
More niggas grab the mics, talking 'bout they gonna set it
When all the rhymes you make is fake as synthetics
We just dead it, plus your style is old as a relic
So burn em up money, cause you gets no credit
You want it? Here it go
Nigga know the Armee, or we gonna be on the straight d-low banging M.C.'s
So keep it live up in here
I swear nothing less, we possess your best record buy
Most Def, Most Def

[Sticky Fingaz]
Sticky Fingaz, earn money from mugging on trains
Where I grew up in Brooklyn New York, moved to Queens in my teens
My pants are busting out the seams with this gun in my jeans
Without it I wouldn’t’ve lived this long in my wildest dreams
And I'm a star, my spotlight’s police high beams

[Hook]

[Outro]
Afficial Nast keep it on, keep keep it on, and ya don’t stop
All City keep it on, keep keep it on, and ya don’t stop
Armee keep it on, keep keep it on, and ya don’t stop
Onyx keep it on, keep keep it on, and ya don’t stop
