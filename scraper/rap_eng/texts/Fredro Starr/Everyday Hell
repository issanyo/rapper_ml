[Intro: Spoken]
Yo, you hear that?
Sound like motherfuckin' black clouds is coming and shit
Sound like the motherfuckin' beat is crying,  God
What you know about pain?

[Verse 1]
Yo the game got me sick I'm trying beat my cold
The devil in the dress trying to reap my soul
But still every night before I sleep I cheat death
I'mma keep on reaching 'til I reach my death
2014 I'm tryin' to make my run
Kill me, the only way you gonna take mine son
But yo, life is more than whips and chains
When you get hot, haters wanna clip your flame
But fuck that, I'm steady trying to stack my bread
In '95 my nigga had the ac in red with that, said
That means I'm a certified vet
Your team can't run up and murder my set
It's real why cowards wanna hate your growth
Why niggas wanna lie when they takin' the oath
But still twenty years I'm still buying cars
I could race and still ain't got a scar
On my face and I'm faced with times
I'm staring in the face of danger
Lighting up kush blowin' L's with strangers
Life is cool other than that
I'm doin' shows, gettin' money, government can't trap
And I rap for niggas that understand my pain
I been through the thunder and the rain
You know all my niggas can't pay bail
It's time to say goodbye to this every day hell

[Hook]
It's time to say goodbye to this every day hell
It's time to say goodbye to this every day hell
It's time to say goodbye to this every day hell
It's time to say goodbye to this every day hell

[Verse 2]
Its hell everyday that I lift my eyes
Cause every day in the hood we risk our lives
And it's like that, here today, the next you're gone
Where I'm from life is short, death is long
I got a teflon hiding in the Mitchell Ness
Bullets bounce off when they hit me the chest
Niggas wanna take me out the physical form
Send me to a place that visit when you're gone
Until then I'mma grind and get as much cash I could get
And hope I don't crash the whip
But this rap shit a have a nigga preachin' like Mason
Or reading a book havin' meetings with Masons
And some turn 5% and some get kill't at the live event
For all my niggas, can't make bail
It's time to say goodbye to this every day hell

[Hook]
It's time to say goodbye to this every day hell
It's time to say goodbye to this every day hell
It's time to say goodbye to this every day hell
It's time to say goodbye to this every day hell
