[Verse 1:]
Uh
My pops was a street nigga, so I'm made in the streets
East 18th my name's engraved in these streets
Like the ground that you walk on, I'm paved in these streets
Since a young boy I was raised in the streets
All my dogs got stayed in the street
All my life, man, I stayed to them streets
Married to my wife, I'm engaged to the streets
Thinking of a way to get paid in my sleep
My niggas in the trap, gettin pain in the streets
I feel trapped like I'm caged in the streets
I'd rather be on vacay, laid on the beach
Cuz the block stays hot, ain't no shade on my street
There's money to be made on the streets
Another 20 G's what he made in a week
Kids selling more than lemonades on the streets
Till the feds come running with the raids on the streets

[Chorus:]
Uh, I'm just what the hood made me
Uh, I'm just what the block made me
Uh, I'm just what the cops made me
Uh, I'm made in the streets
Uh, I'm just what the hood made me
Bruh, I'm just what the block made me
Uh, I'm just what the streets made me
Uh, I'm made in the [Made in the]

[Verse 2:]
I know a lot of players getting played in the streets
In the day you can catch a faint on the streets
But nowadays niggas pulling pays in the heat
Bullets whiz past babies getting grazed on the cheeks
When the birdy came we got a raise in the streets
We protest and put barricades in the streets
Til i get locked in the cage for a week
A lot of war stories get trade in the streets
They buy a bad gun, shoot, betrayed in the heat
Somebody's getting sprayed as I speak
A lot of real niggas get praised in the streets
When they die, it feel like a parade in the the streets
Thanked the lord, even prayed in the streets
Covered in the blood so I'm saved on the streets
Never walk alone, Iâ€™m not afraid of the streets
Got god on my side, I'm made in the streets

[Chorus]
