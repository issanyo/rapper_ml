[Onyx]
Knock 'em out y'all, knock 'em out y'all
Knock 'em out and tell them what we all about y'all
Knock 'em out y'all, knock 'em out y'all
Knock 'em out and tell them what we all about y'all
Knock 'em out y'all, knock 'em out y'all
Knock 'em out and tell them what we all about!

[Sonee Seeza]
Here and now I got what you want so come and get a sip
So I can rip scripts of lyrics makin MC’s feel it
I’m devious, devastating, furious and I can mess you up somethin ludicrous
Ain’t nothing you can do to this
Stop the huffin and puffin I’m snuffin niggas out
I’m makin them stiff and fillin ‘em with lead
Stuffin bloody bloody bloody blood clot that I am not
Left kids in a stack with the big phat sixteen shot, duke listen
Kids is missin in action and that’s not faction, fiction
Eliminate suckers with snub traction
Cause I gets the chills on a mid-summer night
Yeah I could fight or in the winter I’ll make your ass hot like a light
Bulb rub a dub dub, three bodies in a tub
OK, go get the men, with the white gloves
You can call it business, or um, personal
Onyx is burstin whoever want to feel the terror
And to all ya’ll crews, whatever
Cause the place is here, and the time is now

Chorus: Sonee Seeza

The place is where (here) the time is when (now)
The place is where (here) the time is when (now)
The place is where (here) the time is when (now)
The place is where (here) ..

[Fredro Starr]
At night time I kill ‘em bloody, I’m a canine
Search and find the dead mindful blast fast
Roughin ‘em up, toughen ‘em up as as it is it what was a damn murder?
Dead as a dog’s dick, I drag
A drastic ass kick or bacdafucup the ass kick
Blast with my strick-9 rhymes
Crimes is crazy, easy baby, mess around get drowned
And have that ass in Baisley
Props is props, unorthodox so watch
Where we live we get beat up by cops
But that can’t stop the kids who stole hip hop
Roof to roof top, drop the anchor
Dead! Dead on arrival forget the fame
The game is survival, you know my name
I throw blows in the world of the rap war
Tap jaws of crews, bruise ‘em on tour

Chorus:Fredro Starr

And the place is where (here), the time is when (now)
The place is where (here), the time is when (now)
The place is where (here), the time is when (now)
The place is where (here), the time is when (now)

[Sticky Fingaz]
I’ve come to suck your blood upon the microphone
Gaze deep into my eyes, I’ll make you turn to stone
It'll be Night of the Walking Dead if you don’t leave me the hell alone
Cause rap ain’t no game, but I’m playin for keeps
I live in the rotten apple, the city that never sleeps
Stop, you tried to steal my style and got spotted
Niggas can’t get it, cause niggas ain’t got it
Been a bald head since the age of ten
Plus I’m a ruthless crook and I was born in Brooklyn
So a stick up, it’s a piece of cake
For the kid with the sticky fingers everything I touch I take
So don’t make me angry, you won’t like me when I’m angry
All that frustration starts to change me
Then I scream 'til my voice gets hoarse
It’s time to face the music and the Red Cross
You can fool some of the people some of the time
The beats gets the heart, and the words get the mind
I’m livin proof there’s no hope for mankind

Chorus: Sticky Fingaz

The place is where (here), and now is the time
The place is where (here), the time is when (now)
The place is where (here), the time is when (now)
The place is where (here), the time is when (now)
The place is where (here), the time is when (now)

[Sticky] And now I wanna battle!
[Sonsee] Word up
And this ain't melody, melody
So don't sing it, bring it!!
[Sticky] Let's throw down

[Fredro Starr]
Aiyyo
We need a little motherfuckin bit of crowd participation
(Bust dat motherfuckin ass!) KnowwhatI'msayin?
When I say bust dat ass, you say bust dat ass
Here we go..
