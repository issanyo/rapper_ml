Chorus:
Punk mother fuckers, punk punk mother fuckers
Punk mother fuckers, punk punk mother fuckers
Punk mother fuckers, punk punk mother fuckers
Punk mother fuckers, punk mother fuckers
Punk mother fuckers, punk punk mother fuckers
Punk mother fuckers, punk mother fuckers

Fredro:
Check me out
Check me out

Who’s the punk master? The pussy one, who is he?
He ain’t getting busy, I get grizzly
I’ma have a field day with ya’ll mother fuckers
Bringing 96 degrees in December
Fuck all ya’ll
I don’t give a fuck about none of ya’ll
I’m running ya’ll
Punk mother fuckers, I’ll put the gun in ya’ll
So pipe down
I got this mic now
The sound that makes niggas wanna fuck shit up on shaky ground
Spies like us rush guys like you
I stomp out crews with dog shit on my shoes

Chorus

Sticky Fingaz:
God damn these punk ass niggas make me fucking sick and I can’t take it no more
I’m getting tired of this shit
If ya’ll stupid ass motherfuckers don’t quit
I’m a have a fit and ya’ll gonna regret it
Word up
Fuck that scrub, you a piece of shit
And you pissing me off nigga, get off my dick
Matter of fact, lay on the floor cause you dead meat
And I know you a pussy cause you are what you eat
Sweet pretty bitch niggas need to stay off the street
Punk mother fuckers, punk punk mother fuckers
Punk mother fuckers, punk mother fuckers

Sonsee:
Come on nigga, what are you dusted?
Your shit gonna get crushed, kid
Fuck the discussions
Niggas just get concussions
The synapses, I make them collapse with relapses
I’m a hazard, perhaps it’s the way that I trash shit
Your punk ass style is bullshit, garbage, doo-doo, extra little
I’m droppin the big shit that bust your whole fucking noodle
Punk mother fuckers irk my nerves to the maximum
And I’m asking them no questions, when I’m seem them, I’m bashin' them
Give me that goddamn mic, you can’t handle it
Touch one of mine and watch the vandal get to slam you kid
Slam like Hulk Hogan, when I’m
Choking my trigger for a nigga who want to linger, I’m a put him through the ringer
Word to mama
I’m a let the joint do the honor
Fuckin’ suckers

Chorus

They gonna make us fuck somebody up
If they keep on fronting like the way they do

Sticky Fingaz:
The words that I write
I recite with all my might
Cause if rap cause violence I’ma try to start a fight
To keep all these punk ass niggas from out my sight
You know cheesy ass niggas are easy to identify
They never look you in the eye
And they be fuckin’ up your high
So if and when I die
Don’t let no fake punk ass mother fuckers come to my wake

Sonsee:
Well I’m back again starting shit
Punk, you want no part of it
My crew beat ass, the demolitionists
So to hell with all you novices
I could just smack a punk in the face with a spiked glove with much love
And hang ‘em, therefore they gonna get rubbed the wrong way
The strong play hard
That’s us
The ramrod
Then bust puss at your squad

Sticky Fingaz:
Meep, Meep
Ariba ariba, undalay undalay, gang way
That’s what dumb punk niggas used to say
But take your fucking time and hold your horses
We got an army and coming through with armed forces

Fredro Starr:
You’s a punk mother fucker and your mother’s a punk bitch
You gotta hit harder than that nigga, is that all you can come with?
I’ll beat the living shit out this nigga
Nah yo, fuck that, let this nigga suffer
I’ll tie him up, fuck his girl and handcuff her
The rougher, the harder I’ll whip your ass like your father
Go to your room
You peaches and herbs, but we disturb the peace
You the mother fucker that be calling police
And I’m starving, screaming on them deep “What’s to eat?”
The first mother fucker that go to sleep

Sonsee:
Ahhh, I’m sore
It’s this punk nigga’s fault
Let’s bust em all down and beat them to a bloody pulp
Roar
Hardcore galore is what I’m for, and breaking punks jaws
Let me hear yeah ya’ll yeah ya’ll
I’m the kind to swing on ya mind
A pay taker KO’in punks with verbal haymakers
Connections whenever I’m plexin’, ain’t no question
Punks prepare for some more stressin’

Chorus
