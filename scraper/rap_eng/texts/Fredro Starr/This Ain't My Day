[Intro: Spoken]
Damn man, what time is it?
Damn, I'm fucking late, shit
Yeah man, we all had days like this, know what I'm saying?
Just wanna go right back to sleep when you wake up, know what I mean?
Well, at least the sun is shinning right? At least we breathing

[Verse 1]
More problems is all need
This the last blunt, I'm blowing all my weed
I can't stand when no trees in my jar
Brand new Benz, somebody keyed my car
Then the phone rang, "yeah, we gonna smoke ya ass"
Then I dropped the iPhone 5, Goddamm, I broke the glass
When I was too broke for gas, nobody wanted to smoke me
The cops roll past, hope they don't smell the smoke, b
I guess I'm just weary of cops
Then I stepped in dog, fucked up my Jeremy Scotts
Had to switch up, threw on a pair of Y3's
Then I jumped in the Benz, damn where my keys?
Shit, I can't find where my keys is
I guess I gotta take my chick Prius
At least it don't take a lot of gas
Last night I lost my bank card, a nigga outta cash
Mama said there be days like this
When you ain't even got enough trees to blaze one spliff
Then this crazy chick, she started screaming "don't come back"
I guess she found the condoms cause she calling me a scumbag
It's way too early to disturb the neighbors
Then I walk outside and served with papers
All I need is another lawsuit
Then it started raining, there go my velour suit

[Hook]
This just ain't my day
This just ain't my day
This just ain't my day
This just ain't my day
Mama said there be days like this
When you ain't even got enough trees to blaze one spliff
This just ain't my day
This just ain't my day

[Verse 2]
So now I'm drenched in the rain
Like somebody trying to throw a wrench in the game
Not to mention I'm late for a meeting
It's mad traffic on the major deacon
Tomorrow is a holiday, it's a major weekend
Got a call from the homie
Today he supposed give me back some money
That he owe me he making up excuses like, "come on son, you know me
We been through it all, so I know you gonna hold me"
Yeah, to make a long story short, I dipped and dived
Shit, I could rob a bank man, the way a nigga drive
I arrived at my meeting thirty minutes late
Talking 'bout they wanna cancel and set another date
A brother waited two months to make this shit happen
Came back to the car, another ticket in Manhattan
It's like when you think it is, when it ain't
My velour fucked up, leaned on wet paint, man, shit

[Hook]
This just ain't my day
This just ain't my day
This just ain't my day
This just ain't my day
Mama said there be days like this
When you ain't even got enough trees to blaze one spliff
This just ain't my day
This just ain't my day

[Outro: Spoken]
Man this is crazy man, know what I'm saying?
I'm 'bout to go back to the crib, this is fucked up son
I need to smoke man, let's go to the motherfuckin' spot, b
Yeah man, call dread man, I need to get my mind right
