[Intro: Fredro Starr]
A$AP Mob, what time is it?
It’s time to get live, it’s time to represent
A$AP Mob, what time is it?
It’s time to get live, it’s time to represent
A$AP Mob, what time is it?
It’s time to get live, it’s time to represent
A$AP Mob, what time is it?
It’s time to get live, it’s time to represent

[Verse 1: A$AP Twelvyy]
I’ve been livin’ with no second chances, makin’ sales
In a yellow Vanson, standin’ out lookin’ hella handsome
I know the boys want me candid camera
But I slid to ’Bama, I'm city slickin' with some country grammar
I’m Santana with bandanas, I blam blammers
I’m Bad Santa with foul manners, y’all can’t stand us
I'm outlandish without limits, I paint pictures
I drink 40 defeat foes, I take ribs
I’m a parasite, mobbin’ through yo’ satellites
Givin’ out this water, only way to feed my appetite
Gettin’ bad advice, liquor with the gun
Put it on for the hood never been Hollywood
Yeah, you can holler at the homie
I’m on the corner now gettin’ dollas with the homies
These niggas really know me, my brothers, my goldies
A young OG, Mr. Obi Wan Kenobi

[Chorus: A$AP Twelvyy]
It’s the everyday struggle (Yeah, dat)
That’s just work up in my bubble (Yeah, dat)
Shit, we all gon’ bubble (Yeah, dat)
Tryna’ make that shit double
It’s the everyday struggle (Yeah, dat)
Try to stay out of trouble (Yeah, dat)
Got this work up in my bubble

[Verse 2: A$AP Twelvyy]
Hell never sleep, I’m in the zone I’m a better me
I was drinkin’ ‘tron to the dome those is memories
I was in the cone with them stones dodgin’ enemies
Ya’ll ready for this cold soul in this industry
I was slippin’ just a lost soul in his misery
I was pitchin’ just a tadpole in a bigger sea
They was snitchin’ how you gon’ fold on the embassy
Never switchin’ money over bitches, that and all my niggas
I grew up nigga, I grew nuts nigga
I play hard, grind to great, came up nigga
Now I’m laughin’ at them other niggas
They tried to flex when they seen us
But they know they ain’t fuckin’ wit’ us
We deserve this, we put in groundwork
We get it worldwide made the sound work
Seeing work made the dream work
Our team first ’cause we seen worse
The money made our dream burst

[Chorus: A$AP Twelvyy]
It’s the everyday struggle (Yeah, dat)
That’s just work up in my bubble (Yeah, dat)
Shit, we all gon’ bubble (Yeah, dat)
Tryna’ make that shit double
It’s the everyday struggle (Yeah, dat)
Try to stay out of trouble (Yeah, dat)
Got this work up in my bubble
