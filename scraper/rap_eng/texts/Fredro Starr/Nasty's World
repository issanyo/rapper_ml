[Skit: A$AP Bari, (Playboi Carti)]
Fuck that bitch she's type scandolous anyways
Ain't nobody got time for her
That bitch's breath stinks and you know her pussy stinks
(That ass is fat) No, what we doing back there
Yo Carti I bet you ate that bitch out two weeks ago
(Say what noooo he wasn't ready)
No, Keisha told me that, but I didn't believe it
Now I believe it, that bitch house smell like piss I heard!
Let's go to the Bronx though, I got these bitches, real talk
Flacko's not coming bro
Let's gon' go to the Bronx bro
We gon' take a Snapchat, he gon' fuck with it
Let's go to Dyckman and fuck with the hoes

[Chorus: Fredro Starr]
It's time to get live, live, live like a wire
Time to get live, live, live, live like a wire
It's time to get live, live, live like a wire
Time to get live, live, live, live like a wire

[Verse 1: A$AP Nast]
Check it out, yo, yo-yo, numero uno
I'm big dog Cujo, slamming rappers like a sumo
Just bought a two do', I'm one nigga macking two hoes
My style too cold, the wild child, but who are you though?
I'm kung-fu flow, the gangsta corny like that movie Juno
And fuck your vest my gun shoots through those
Shoot up your funeral, then leave out screaming “Kudos!”
But keep it cool though, the messy ones
We don't do those, but you know the Mob major
Niggas hate us, they bitches want to date us
We keep their pussy wet and see em' later
The whole style made up and yo for real though
You can't faze us, yo keep it real son, we too playa
Can't even say much, my live wire'll burn your place up
I tell you straight up, I'm hardcore go get your weight up

[Chorus: Fredro Starr]
It's time to get live, live, live like a wire
Time to get live, live, live, live like a wire
It's time to get live, live, live like a wire
Time to get live, live, live, live like a wire

[Verse 2: A$AP Nast]
I'm past the focus, I'm in my zone, fuck who hasn't noticed
Hoes ain't like me, said I'm ugly, now they acting open
Pussy soaking, I pimp the hoes like my name's Goldie
The name's Nasty, yeah. Your freak know me
I beat the box, leave that thing swollen
Cruise through my city with my hammer loaded
The pigs annoying like the sound of locusts
I style wild plus my rhymes the dopest
My squad the best, a bunch of lyrical soldiers
Just Roc-A-Fella, Hov-a-sclupture
We drink Henny like soda, reject chicks like “hold-up!”
And know the game like we 'ppose to
Our lives are like a roller coaster
The ups and downs keep my fam closer
No sneak attacks, these niggas can't approach us
Damn jokers, we delete stack chips
And keep the heat for vultures
That anyday could try to run up on us, uh

[Chorus: Fredro Starr]
It's time to get live, live, live like a wire
Time to get live, live, live, live like a wire
It's time to get live, live, live like a wire
Time to get live, live, live, live like a wire
