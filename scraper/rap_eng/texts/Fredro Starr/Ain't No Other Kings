[Biggie SampleL]
Ain't No Other Kings in this rap thing

[Verse 1:]
While the whole New York was writing they responses
That new Porsche was fighting with my conscience
It's nonsense, we all know who the king is
The hardest rap group in the game is me and Fingers
The thing is, Young niggas losing all they principles
Think that they addressable
Ready, be thinking sissyble
Dont get killed for entertainment
I got shooters on deck, I just tell em when to aim it
In my arraignment, the case thrown out
Just that boom-ba boom-ba
Make the face blown out
From audible dot. got beef so I bought a few Glocks
Sending rappers to a portable box
Tryna cop an unaffordable watch, to tell time with
Rhymes sorta real like words of the Islamic
There no designer, these niggas can't figure me out
Lets bring it back, just like when Biggie was out

[Verse 2:]
Who shot you? That's the big question
Big probably rolling in his grave, the way they dressing
2Pac could never rock colorful tube socks
Niggas rocking skirts, what's next?
Rubbers and through tops
Don't get it twisted like the Rubik's
If you stepping on my new kicks
I'mma shoot Stanley Kubrick
Not for the cinema, More sinister
Than the devil, get the minister
Bless you and then I finish ya
They tryna administer CPR
Rap game dying faster than the GTR
Half my niggas is facing incarceration
Why these niggas rap, do more songs than the constellation
Concentration, what you rapper need
As the climbers need, What the fuck you think I'm talking, Japanese?
All rappers bleed so don't act fly
We got one more chance
Just like Biggie, don't let rap die
