[Intro: Spoken]
Yeah, this that New York
Know what I mean, word up
4 o'clock in the morning shit
Roll up, light up, uh

[Hook]
This that New York, front of the bodega
Where kids drink 40's and blunts with gold vega's
Where niggas wear black mask like the lone ranger
Run in the store, like let me hold me the paper
This that New York, front of the bodega
Where kids drink 40's and blunts with gold vega's
Where niggas wear black mask like the lone ranger
Run in the store, like let me hold me the paper
This that New York, New York, New York

[Verse 1]
This the city of dreams that could turn to nightmares
Can't find one nigga that'll fight fair
Everybody got a quick scheme to get rich
Flip bricks or trying to hit the pic six
Get a quick fix, all the fiends really want
IPads getting smoked in the Philly blunt
Me, I'm smokin' blunts at the sky bar
Columbus Circle at the high bar
"Hi y'all", black AP. gat off safety
I'm so thugged out, look what rap made me
You don't see, don't say nothing
New York, New York, like nobody know nothing
It's the code of the streets, I'm a Queens nigga
Late night I'm running in the lower east

[Hook]
This that New York, front of the bodega
Where kids drink 40's and blunts with gold vega's
Where niggas wear black mask like the lone ranger
Run in the store, like let me hold me the paper
This that New York, front of the bodega
Where kids drink 40's and blunts with gold vega's
Where niggas wear black mask like the lone ranger
Run in the store, like let me hold me the paper
This that New York

[Verse 2]
This where hip hop came from
Graffiti on the trains and they snatching your chain, son
Everybody pulling fast moves, blast crews, cash rules
Cause every bill is past due
If they ask you what time it is
It's just stick up kids trying to set up
You know I know what time it is
You gotta have streets smarts to learn your lesson
Hennessy straight can burn your intestines
This for my G's that burned in the essence
I'm in the GT burnin' down 7th
I doubled back, put money on jets
Came back, doubled up, put money on the nets
I took that, doubled up on some coke from up town
Took it back down to buck town
We open all night, all week
New York stand strong like the bull on Wall Street

[Hook]
This that New York, front of the bodega
Where kids drink 40's and blunts with gold vega's
Where niggas wear black mask like the lone ranger
Run in the store, like let me hold me the paper
This that New York, front of the bodega
Where kids drink 40's and blunts with gold vega's
Where niggas wear black mask like the lone ranger
Run in the store, like let me hold me the paper
This that New York

[Outro]
That New York
That New York
That New York
That New York
That New York
That New York
That New York
