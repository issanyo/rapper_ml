Onyx

They tried to poison the fetus
We gonna check it out like this
All hail
The high exalted
Yo
My mother fucking name is Fredro Starr
You know what I'm saying?
I'm up here with my man Sonee the money the motherfucking Greeza
And my motherfucking nigga Sticky the fucking Fingaz
You know what I'm saying?
Yo Son
Step to your motherfucking business nigga...word up

[Sonsee]
I’m not the type to be flabbergasted, but all my data’s mastered
It ain’t a madder bastard, boom I had it, niggas get plastered
Soon as I bring what I got in store for this war
Who want it? We got what you're looking for
Fuck ya gonna do now money?
Cause it’s the, Sonsee Seeza, Mr. Chocolate bust em like a blister
I get downright depriving on nigga’s   p-rop-z’s; gimme all of these
Ya’ll niggas is puss
What’s the matter, I thrust, bum rush and batterize and assault and catapult
Like a bolt I shock shit
The faker hurter, word to murder, ripping the madder shit to make you BACDAFUCUP further

[Fredro Starr]
Hold up the press, here comes the mess
Worship the best, or die like the rest
You have the right to remain violent
Anything you say can and will be used against you to kill
I’m a tyrant, striking like a viking
A knight in shining armor, death before dishonor
The ruff rhymer, suicidal like Nirvana
The end of your world is just beginning, there's no winning in my inning
Cause dead things cannot effect the living
So I drift into the winds of the ghetto bad weather
I’m lost in the desert but the storm blows me on
Never talk to a stranger, everybody’s in grave danger
Me and my peoples just shout out anger

[Bridge]
Fuck that, we better off dead

[Sticky Fingaz]
I’m considered less than a God, but more than a man
I can knock down a mule like Conan the Barbarian
With my mental powers and my sixth sense
That can raise a dead crowd into a live audience
(so get the fuck out the way)
Or what? Get your ass cut
Cause if you goin to jail they’ll probably make a pussy out ya butt

[Sonsee]
No doubt
Here’s the clique which is known as a black stone
Hard
Fuck around and we’ll shatter your track bone
Scarred
You get for life, I’m concise, niggas get done up precise
Cut up fine and fucked up real nice
Be ready to meet your maker
And die like the Lakers
Faking jackers smack ‘em backwards with the front of the black gat tactics
Straight from the desert-(queens)
Where niggas is desperate
So I'm taking mines from the entrance to the exit

[Hook] (2X)
Get a life?
Fuck that, we better off dead

[Fredro Starr]
Cover me, I’m going in
Move ‘em in
Take em out in the time when niggas seem to always fight a lost battle
Its too late to pray I'm selling one way tickets to hell
"Now, run, tell" is what you punk niggas yell like
Ahhhhh
That’s the sound of your bitch ass hurting
Blindside attack your back with Steel Curtain
Sticky come out, come out wherever you are

[Sticky Fingaz]
So now add all that up to the fact that I’m a nigga that could just beat your mother fucking ass
To hurt your feelings
Cause your shit is trash
‘Chu need people like me, cause they not worthy
Construct my coalition, it’s a demolition derby
To all the spit you talk make the mic smell like saliva
Yuck, you need to retire, resign
I’m ahead of my time, in my prime, one of a kind & out of my mind
And ain't nothing in this world free so me I’ma kick it paid style
I ain't got no smile, I was abused as a child
My moms gave birth to a crazy ass wild one
Bust out her pussy with a motherfucking gun
And started talking slang
Even joined a gang
In suicide scums
I sold jums to the bums
I was the hand to hand man pulling in crumbs
Then I started dealing, robbing and stealing
Got knocked for a killing now I’m known as a villain
So if you want problems I’m ready and willing
And I’ll get up in your mouth like a fucking filling

FUCK DAT WE BETTA OFF DEAD
Please somebody kill me before I put two in my own head...
