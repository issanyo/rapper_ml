[Intro: Ernie Chambers]
I wouldn’t go to Syria, I wouldn’t go to Iraq
I wouldn’t go to Afghanistan, I wouldn’t go to Yemen
I wouldn’t go to Tunisia, I wouldn’t go to Lebanon
I wouldn’t go to Jordan – I would do it right here!
Nobody from ISIS ever terrorized us
As a people as the police do daily

[Verse 1: Fredro Starr]
Ayo the world’s in a crisis, ISIS
Shit is cold as ice is, where the fuck Christ is?
Political activists like Mark Dice’s
We law breakin’, run in the stores takin’
TV’s and playstation, a slave nation
We doom on the bloomberg, we’re just the bullies
We’re the Giuliani, we get no respect
They put guns in the hood, what you expect
Like a pack of cigarettes, I can get me a Tec
And a four fifth, they don’t wanna go to war with
Rap music, what we bangin’ at the law with
So keep your Glocks high, aim for the ceilin’
Here comes them villains, gotta stop police killin’
So pardon me, as I blast this, fuck throwing a black fist
To the cops be target practice

[Chorus]
It should be against the law
Fuck authorities, against them all
Cuz niggas ride away, don’t trust the cops
If you down for the cause, we brought shots, nigga
It should be against the law
Fuck authorities, against them all
Cuz niggas ride away, don’t trust the cops
If you down for the cause, we brought shots, nigga

[Verse 2: Sticky Fingaz]
I said move steady, I’m getting the trush ready
Gun store robberies, the armory is heavy
All-black Chevy, hood military
I'll start the revolution right now if you tell me
I'm a convict believe me you’re one too
We convicts, can't leave unless your passport approved
Who is you, fuck the rules, fuck the news, it’s a lie
If you’re ready to make your move let out two in the sky
They gon’ have to call the national guard
Smashin’ ’em hard, you gon’ get sent back to your god
Can’t let these motherfuckers send me back to the yard
If I got a hundred million niggas with me, that could be hard
Cuz I just gotta pick the guns up, to make ’em put the guns down
Enough is enough is enough, black kids gettin’ gunned down
Wherever is your son now, the system corrupt
And when the sun down, you know that the shit gon’ erupt

[Chorus]
It should be against the law
Fuck authorities, against them all
Cuz niggas ride away, don’t trust the cops
If you down for the cause, we brought shots, nigga
It should be against the law
Fuck authorities, against them all
Cuz niggas ride away, don’t trust the cops
If you down for the cause, we brought shots, nigga
