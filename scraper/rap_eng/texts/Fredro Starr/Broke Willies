[Chorus: X-1, (Sticky Fingaz)]
To all you rappers out there (With money and fame)
Rockin' a foreign car (Everything brand name)
Broke Willies with no money (Keep runnin' yo game)
Can't forget all our thugs that's locked in chains

[Verse 1: Fredro Starr, (X-1)]
We ain't have shit growin' up, now we blowin' up
Hundred G's a show, price low enough
Ghetto struck, layin' in the cut with the metal mack 11
No cup, sippin' amaretto 7-up
The wet life, shit is liquid, my wife trippin'
My whole clique got shit to whip it, last switchin'
(Benz to Benz skippin', superstar hittin'
Your whole world is ice rippin, you like sniffin'
You like shittin', tricks trickin'
Rolly with the inscription, watch a rich nigga clickin')
From New York to LA! (Same shit, different day
Mad cash to play) When I walk my chains swing
(I drew swing hevily ill) From Beverly Hills
(I paid 20 g's) Damn son it better be real
(We holdin' your deals, its 70 mils) Eaten meals
Of Beverly pills (Now watch how the bubbly spills)

[Chorus: X-1, (Sticky Fingaz)]
To all you rappers out there (With money and fame)
Rockin' a foreign car (Everything brand name)
Broke Willies with no money (Keep runnin' yo game)
Can't forget all our thugs that's locked in chains
To all you rappers out there (With money and fame)
Rockin' a foreign car (Everything brand name)
Broke Willies with no money (Keep runnin' yo game)
Can't forget all our thugs that's locked in chains

[Verse 2: Sticky Fingaz, {Sonee Seeza}]
I grew up in the PJ's and wore the same gear for three days
Sit to get a blunk out I wanna blew a mill in the month
From a low life, the one I go shopping, I'm not worried 'bout no price
{I wear the same clothes TWICE!} Fuck the PO-LICE!
{Its hydro stuff L’s, six plus sells
Stones heavy on the scales themselves, XL
Strait G's, moneys and properties
Black F-G 15‘s, weightin' trees and OC‘s}
We old g’s always OT-in on a low-key
Spit more game than goldie, your bitch chose me
{Suppose WE most-LY, do em slow-LY
We play 'em close-LY, stayed on city cakes} They get erase them!
A sucker for a pretty face, with a twenty waist
Whos Benz I hit two twins in a blue Ventz
{And we're in destroy deals, a house flow for reals}
Cause white-collar crimes equal dolla' dolla' sign!

[Chorus: X-1, (Sticky Fingaz)]
To all you rappers out there (With money and fame)
Rockin' a foreign car (Everything brand name)
Broke Willies with no money (Keep runnin' yo game)
Can't forget all our thugs that's locked in chains
To all you rappers out there (With money and fame)
Rockin' a foreign car (Everything brand name)
Broke Willies with no money (Keep runnin' yo game)
Can't forget all our thugs that's locked in chains

[Verse 4: Fredro Starr, (X-1), {Sonee Seeza}, Sticky Fingaz]
Yo we went from rags to riches (And get pitches)
With mad bitches (Yo!) You can get a autograph
Or one shot, from the semi-auto pass
(Rap niggas flippin more then halfs
Livin' it up, takin' all the cash) Givin' it up!
{We set it up, on a low tilt it up
In the black quest, pass sex to the extress}
From out the blackness, straight on the boulevard
Lookin' for somethin' to get my hands in a strippers dancin' in the mansion
Word up, that's how we operate (Uncut n raw)
{The players copping} Fake cokies stepped on twice
(Put your money on the street niggas under the light) And hold your money tight
(Kids to die) {Raze 'em up} And roll 'em twice
(Even rich nigga ass better so trife)
We'll gamble mo off yo life true I couldn't see well
Flip my P12 Rover key to the e-mail
Wish a hundred tell, g'd out. I walk the hog, I beat jail
{Yall gotta each tell, kick back, relax, word up
Nigga laid up, bills paid up}
(Shit is all sunny when he pulled up in a 4:20)
We throw these cats on the sideline, lookin' all funny
(Gettin' no money, cause they every day clownin'
We play around with thousands) A hundred g's where we countin'
(A hundred G's a show, here we're out kid)
Word! Word! Word!

[Chorus: X-1, (Sticky Fingaz)]
To all you rappers out there (With money and fame)
Rockin' a foreign car (Everything brand name)
Broke Willies with no money (Keep runnin' yo game)
Can't forget all our thugs that's locked in chains
To all you rappers out there (With money and fame)
Rockin' a foreign car (Everything brand name)
Broke Willies with no money (Keep runnin' yo game)
Can't forget all our thugs that's locked in chains
