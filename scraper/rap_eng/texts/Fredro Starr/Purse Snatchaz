There’s no sunshine in the city
That’s the way it’s goin down
People killing, people dying every time I turn around

There's no sunshine...

[Fredro Starr]
I run with purse snatchers, drug dealers and trespassers
Incriminators, and parole violators
I raided with regulators, invaded the instigators
Passed the procrastinators, rolled on retaliators
Broke in a home with burglars, partied with murderers
Ghetto big wheelers, I sold coke for dope dealers
Ask the stash dealers, harass the cash peelers
Did time behind bars, riding in stolen cars
Forty-deuce flicks  posing hard, rollin large
Pick pockets I picked, pistol packers to bitch smackers, back of the alley attackers, waiting for the crackers
Smugglers, muggers in the gutters with rug cutters
Running up on niggas for butter leathers or whatever
Chain takers, train hoppers, clockers, block watchers, cops and robbers
Big hitters, counterfeiters, quitters, money getters
The beaters with heaters, the bleeders, the speeders, and 2 seaters
Crime testers and crime confessors, yeah peer pressures
My guess is as good as yours why niggas be taking drawers
Rapers and zipper rippers
Fake rappers and over actors
Bottle throwers, the buddha growers, high rollers, cigar smoke blowers
Bowlers, pool players, slashers, bashers, crusaders
Hallway solicitors pulling out on project visitors
Schemers and scandalers, big dreamers and pan handlers
Ready to run up on a Rockefeller
Put the Glock in the teller and tell the bitch to give it up
Hurry up, hurry up

To me, USG living, is one gigantic ring of concealing
Double dealing, drug fiending, selling and scheming on the next being
Fleeing from the cops, court proceedings
Illegal operating, law violating and death escalating
We all need our dollars straighten but we can't be tolerating
Man that's frustrating, that's why we be demonstrating
How we be law breaking, cash taking, drug juggling hand to hand
Stand and lookout, many struck out to keep from struggling
Embezzling, extorting, man slaughter and assaulting
Mass shootings, ‘nuff stabbings, gangs feuding and females boosting
For child supporting, or self done abortion
Everything costing, we all lusting for this fortune
So we'll still be rowdy and rioting and looting
And regrouping until we see some more improving
It'll be mad human deletion, seeking completion
Why nigga?
Cuz every day is killing season

I pledge allegiance to the streets and blame God for the creation
Of this pitiful earth that's filled with temptation
(Birth) was my invitation, (death) will be my initiation
Now I just got off probation, so wish me congratulation
But I'm still under investigation, for psychic evaluation
Facin incarceration and isolation over some color discrimination
So I need your participation in the caucasian assassination
Time is wastin, it's a sticky situation!
Tryna stop our reproduction, to kill off our population
And it's no exaggeration, so whoever's in association
With the nigga retaliation I need your total cooperation
We in hours of desperation, and for your information
A confrontation will be fought by (THE YOUNGER GENERATION!)
Cause we got determination, now all we need is organization
So I use my concentration with a Jim Crow education
(Cause) if history repeats itself your destination's the plantation
To overcome this observation depends upon the communication
Then without an explanation a hesitation will have a reservation to be lynched from a tree for decoration
So, because of these altercations we need to make some alterations
Let’s begin with the manipulation of this whole Goddamned nation
Hold up it’s time for my medication so it’s the end of your conversation
