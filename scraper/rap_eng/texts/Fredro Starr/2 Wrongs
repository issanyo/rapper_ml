Bottomline, overall we gotta get this motherfucking cash!
No doubt man, that's what I'm saying man
Illuminati I heard they trying to really just hold shit down
They trying to shut us down God!
They trying to shut us down, cause we rock, on the low

[Hook]
Two wrongs don't make it right but it damn sure make us even (7X)

Verse One: Fredro Starr

Fuck peace I want justice
I’m a nigga with a gun and a right mind to bust this, fuck this
I’m mad at the world hell, I got a vengeance
My first offense I caught the life or death sentence
The real black army’s in jail with no protection
It’s killing me calling these facilities correction
System that is getting us, come on my fellow prisoners
Time to go to war, we’ll be dead if we stay listeners
Time to get the tek and go step to the president
U.S.G. citizens, fuck American resident
And yeah I got a speech impediment
I speak slang, for my niggas who got hanged
{​*DJ cuts and scratches "So throw ya gunz in the.."*}​
They say 'Throw Ya Gunz' was negative, I say fuck them
They the ones who put the guns in the ghetto for destruction
This is oppression, the deception, killing our own complexion
What we need to do is point the guns in the right direction

[Hook]

Verse Two: Sonsee

Yo it’s only getting worse, I’m a burst in controverse
And tell you where I’m from it’s the savage man they curse
It’s the illest, biggest, experiment. What are we guinea pigs in the cages of the projects?
Cause we the ones that’s feeling it
They gave us guns and drugs and watch us bug and rub each other out
So stop doing what they love
Retaliate, it's time to get big and bombard
And flip this shit like the Food of the Gods
They say we got the animal mentality, show them the raw reality
If you real, you ain’t mad at me
But if you is, so the fuck what?
Me and my peeps came to claim the brown man’s cut
Which was really ours; this the hour, better do what I do fuck those nuclear powers that be
We gotta form our own ground
Dominate, infiltrate, and feel great til it burns down
And when it burns, it’s going up in blazes
We gotta do what we shoulda fucking did since the dark ages

[Hook]

Verse Three: Sticky Fingaz

I have a dream, that I must reveal
So I pinch myself to make sure it's real
First we gotta destroy and then rebuild
Even if it mean that I'mma get myself killed
Don't make me no difference, I done wrote my will
And talk about what they did to us is dumb
What we need to be talkign about is what we gonna do to them
I’ll get revenge if it’s the last thing I do
When I start speaking in tongues the Holy Ghost couldn’t save you
So do you want answers?
Yeah I want answers, and I want the truth
You want the truth? You couldn’t handle the truth
Cause they got us brainwashed so we the minority
But when we kill em off we gonna be the majority
Preach on
See I was raised to fight for what I believe in
I won’t forget, can’t forget, I’m trying to get even
And if the whites speak up, then I'll lead my people
Cause two wrongs don't make it right, but it damn sure make us equal
I'm inciting riots, so let's start the looting
And whoever cross the walls I guess we'll just got to shoot them
Cause in this revolution I loathe my enemy
I'm agnostic plus I got no identity
So lovers of life don't keep your hopes up high (WHY?)
Cause it's just a matter of time before it's your turn to die
But until then, when you stop breathing
It's time to stand up and fight for what you believe in!!!!!
