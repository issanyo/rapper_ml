[Intro:]
Yeah, you know Cali got the best trees man word up

[Chorus:]
Killer Cali the suicide queen (x2 suicide queen) [x2]

[Verse 1:]
Car service, bottle service, weed service presidential service
We won't stop till these serve us with the paper
So they kicked down the doors with the guns with the lasers
I'm in the latest whip playing my hits
These bitch niggas salty, lays potato chips
But never catch me slipping like a pair of gators
The weed too loud i can't hear you haters
Bad bitch on my side, four fifth for my side
In the whip with the four dots six on the side
I'm a Southside to the death, fresh to death
Quiet as kept, couple G's in the arm rest
So Feel the calm breeze blowing on balm trees
The killer cali where the ghettos got palm trees
A paradise in the hood, corners on lock
Niggers banging on the whip with the 40 Glocks

[Chorus]

[Verse 2:]
Yeah, you'll finally wish flows up, but take it to the streets
The west coast freeze up, i'll take it to the east
Now i'm back on the west side
180 on the dash a test drive do or die but not from Bed-Stuy
I'm in the XJ there the express way
Overnight fedEx and there the next day
They make it pass xray we all good
I'm a hollywood nigga but i'm all hood
If you don't stand for nothing, you'll fall for anything
Respect comes first that goes with anything
A bring a life from the project straight to the big screen
But never too big to forget queens
Supreme team was my teen idols
Living that life any means of survival
How you gonna make it to the top if ya scared a heights
I'm a thug so i'm stereotyped

[Chorus]
