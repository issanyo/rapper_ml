[Verse 1: Fredro Starr]
When I die, fuck it I wanna go to hell
Cause I'm a hundred mad, it ain't hard to fucking tell
It don't make sense, going to heaven with the goodie-goodies
Dressed in white, I like black Tims and black hoodies
Get me through the night, lookin like a grim reaper
Shut a nigga lights out, put'em in the sleeper
Plus I crypt keepers, graveyard shift like killa
And you can see murdas, just like Steve Miller
My backstreet killaz, South Side is a ghost town
Niggas try to play me, them niggas is ghost now
This is how it goes down, with black hoodie rap
We stick you up, you gotta pay to get your goodies back
This is where the hood is at, like Pac we hit'em up (hit em up) with one touch of the fully mac
Index on the hair pin trigga, go be the next nigga, back to the hook Jigga

Black hoodie rap, black hoodie rap
Black hoodie rap, black, black hoodie rap

[Verse 2: Sticky Fingaz]
Fuck that pop shit, fuck with me you get popped quick
My guns give you a sex change, you turn to a bitch
And I don't wear skinny jeans cuz my Glocks don't fit
Fuck around try to pull out, and blow off my dick
This that shit, make you mad squinch on ya'face
How you tie niggas up try to get in their safe
Either rap too soft, or we too hard
It's that jailhouse music bang that shit in your yard
All that internet gangstas, that's the problem
Talking 'bout shooting while they're just fast in bloggin'
In the streets getting cream like Baskin-Robbins, even it mean I gotta start blastin' and robbin'
Goin' to jail for criminals like going to school, you come out a little better at the crimes you do
And when I die, don't dress me up in the suit
It's A1s, hard denim, black hoodies, I'm cool

[Verse 3: Makem Play]
Keep a black hoodie for the strong armrobbery
Me and my gun close, that's comradery
Cold blood it runs through my vains
Fuck ya'll I know thugs, that'll run through your game
My niggas bang, on site in broad daylight, walk by and take a nigga life
See the hoodie cover my face, no need for mask, shades for the green eyes, pussy nigga I need mine
You need time, and clock's still ticking 3, 2, 1 I'mma load up my gun
Boom! Nigga face down, hands behind your back, that's some police shit, you don't know me bitch
You ever heard of Rob & Vic?
Well I'm just like them, in a form what I got is sin
Shells longer than a q-tip fuck talkin' it out, throw my hoodie on and walk in ya house, nigga
