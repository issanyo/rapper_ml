[Intro: Sticky Fingaz]
Motherfucking police
Always be fucking with me
Everywhere that I go
Motherfucking police
Always be fucking with me
Everywhere that I go

[Chorus: Fredro Starr]
Do I look
Like a criminal, criminal, criminal
Criminal? What the fuck? Do I look
Like a criminal, criminal, criminal
Criminal? What the fuck? Do I look
Like a criminal?

[Verse 1: Fredro Starr]
Police wanna hella sweat
Cuz I keep a hoodie on, Bill Belichick
Every night I’m gettin’ stop-and-frisk
When I walk in the drugstore they think I’m here to shoplift
I’m just pickin’ up Percocet prescriptions
Cops always tell me that I fit the descriptions
So what, I got prior convictions
And can’t leave the house less it’s under conditions
In other words, I’m a changed man, but they think
I’m doin’ crime every time money exchanges hands
I’ve never been on Gangland, got tats on my neck
And they think i’m in a gang, damn!
So what I got on blue laces? And I’m fightin’
For my life, cuz a nigga got two cases
I guess I got these crackers shook
They scared to death when they see me

[Chorus: Fredro Starr]
What the fuck? Do I look
Like a criminal, criminal, criminal
Criminal? What the fuck? Do I look
Like a criminal, criminal, criminal
Criminal? What the fuck? Do I look
Like a criminal, criminal, criminal
Criminal? What the fuck? Do I look
Like a criminal?

[Verse 2: Merkules]
Hundred mad motherfucker
These tattoos got them thinking I’m bad news
I’m the reason their kids like to listen to rap tunes
But cash rules, my face covered in scars
Cops is on me cuz they think I’m trynna run from a charge
Man it’s bad, I can’t even hit the mall in peace
The second the public see me they just call the police
I keep my third eye open when I walk these streets
They don’t wanna give me chances all they want is the beef
And I know I did some real wild shit in my past
So they test me by telling me I gotta piss in this glass
This shit isn’t right, I ask them what they talking about
Cuz I see them them out my window when they watching my house
I swear to god they better not step foot on my yard
I’ll start jumping at these suckers, have them look at their god
Fuck a stereotype, you better take it back bitch
I wasn’t born this way, the cops made me like this
I ain’t a…

[Chorus: Fredro Starr]
…criminal, criminal, criminal
Criminal? What the fuck? Do I look
Like a criminal, criminal, criminal
Criminal? What the fuck? Do I look
Like a criminal, criminal, criminal
Criminal? What the fuck? Do I look
Like a criminal?

[Verse 3: Sticky Fingaz]
Do I look like a criminal? Cuz my pants be saggin’?
Red box scissors and my drawers are slaggin’
They say that my facials look so violent
What the fuck? That’s racial profilin’
Pull me over like my tag is expired and shit
Like there’s no way that’s his, he hot-wired that shit
Gun registered, still trynna hide that shit
Till this day they can’t believe they let me buy that shit
I come to visit, you think i’m scopin’ out your spot
They takin’ pictures, you takin’ this for my mugshot?
They’ve callin’ me a criminal for so damn long
I start to believe they right and
You gon’ make do somethin’ wrong
You see me in the hood, you think i’m trynna rob you
I’m just talkin’ to you, when you think i’m trynna con you
No matter what, they gon’ call me a crook
So you think I give a fuck if I look like a motherfuckin’…

[Chorus: Fredro Starr]
…criminal, criminal, criminal
Criminal? What the fuck? Do I look
Like a criminal, criminal, criminal
Criminal? What the fuck? Do I look
Like a criminal, criminal, criminal
Criminal? What the fuck? Do I look
Like a criminal?
