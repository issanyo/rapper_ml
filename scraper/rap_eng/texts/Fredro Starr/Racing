[Intro:]
Yeah
It's your boy Dro Starr
Got my man from Denmark
Mike Raw, Yeah

[Chorus:]
I feel like I'm racing
Baby hold me down
I promise I'mma set you off
And baby when we made it
Girl we gon ride forever
There's no breaks on this car
I feel like I'm racing, yeah
I feel like I'm racing, yeah. Alright

[Verse 1:]
Let's get Audi like a R8
You've been racing through my mind like a car chase
While you running through my mind you make my heart race
Before you fall in love, put on your heart breaks
Let me ride through your inner thoughts
It's in your mind, it's kinda like intercourse
My race and I'm riding ??? in the course
Then I swerve, hugging curves like I'm in the Porsche
Money on my mind, I've been divorced
Been fly, I don't even begin the floors
Let me park in your garage and turn the engine off
This is power baby, sure to blow the hinges off
Hair flying in the air when I jet through
59 with the hills make it 62
Looking like a young muscle  when I whip through
Model chick, shift gear set the ???? quick

[Chorus]

[Verse 2:]
Yeah, You got me feeling like I'm off t the races
Foreign chick, can't figure what your race is
Foreign whip, you move so graciou
No top, feeling [?]
And You remind me of a race car
Move fast, slick body like a race car
Take yo time baby, you ain't gotta race Starr
Or we could cruise round the track like a pace car
And we can ride off and take you inner state
Let me drive straight through your interstate
One touch, you can feel the power generate
Make a nigga overheat, hyperventilate
The way you drive, we never late for dinner dates
When you get love, they begin to hate
And you can feel the power that the engine make
Back to the drive way, We'll let dinner wait

[Chorus]
