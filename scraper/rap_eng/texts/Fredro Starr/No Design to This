[Intro:]
Ugh, yea
Made in the streets
Audible Doctor, you know how we do
Sometimes, you know, you gotta kill em on your own

[Verse 1:]
Yow, don’t need accomplices, to accomplish this
When I kill em it’s anonymous, cops won’t even know what kind a crime it is
Or what time it is, or who rhyme it is
I move inconspicuous
Dese niggas suspect, they move in suspiciousness
So quit maliciousness, make it hard to put two shots in your meniscus-cus
What kind a diss is dis, what they tryna offer us?
Police officers, what we walkin like, morpheus
Real shit, give unto you straight like d gorpheus
Niggas tryna make me get notorious, have me on the run jus like Norris, hotter than the stories
Two boxing where the projects is, right where the college is
Ma mind got scientist, turn a anologist
Here’s fo’ anotha rhyme who would define who the college kids
But they can’t figure me out, there’s no design to this

[Chorus:]
There’s no design to this[x3]
But they can’t figure me out, there’s no design to this
There’s no design to this[x3]
But they can’t figure me out, there’s no design to this

[Verse 2:]
The best by far, even measured few kilometers
Burn MC’s, 80 degrees in your thermometers
180 M.O.P’s on da speedometer
Homicide circle d block, we on they monitors
Cops wanna indict em fo’ arsen, call the firemen
Passion an d oain is burnin up, inside a dem
Get on the microphones like rock king inspired them
Rhymes so advanced, had Bill Gates is hiring em
To work with Microsoft in technology
Nigga turn yo mic off now respect quality
If yo ballsy enough, respect d policy
Shrinks try to get in ma brain with psychology
I’m feeling like this, set fire when I’m like this
Bout to say I’m sick to death, laryngitis
Niggas tryna stress d work like tendonitis
Now they got me locked in a room with 10 psychics

[Chorus]
