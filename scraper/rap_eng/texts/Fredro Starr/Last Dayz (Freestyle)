Here's where I'm not from -- I'm not gonna spray it. You, rappin' on my name, I know where ya stay at. I'm a dangerous dude/man; I'll lay you where you lay at. I'm so raw -- replay that. (X2)

(Verse I)
The longevity of my artistry won't define me. The artistry of my longevity will be untimely. Rhymes sprees resign these fakes with sublime ease. This period, time bleeds for dime breeds. Alike the siamese, collaboration is key. Reason these MCs ain't ill, cause they still rather patients to treat. Take it from me, stations deceive what greatness should be. It's sacred to breathe for the sake to relieve. Gotta be blatant to please. Cause mindsets' vacant, but seized. Illuminati got niggas smokin' reefer with the reaper. Tokin' deeper with a cheaper outlook. Now, devout crooks sprout, hooked to innocence. And blend intense malice to awaken in a palace. Reel means to fulfill dreams build schemes to reveal gleams. Squeal, scream for the dollar bill, green monetary, honorary currency, currently spawned to very far lengths of amounts. Banks of denounced existence, ranked to account its listings, leave many without a pot to piss in. Success is the key if not the mission. Stop to listen!
