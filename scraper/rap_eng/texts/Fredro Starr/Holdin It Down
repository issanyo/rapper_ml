[Chorus:]
Holding down, and you don't stop
Time is money so I stay late
Holding it down, for life... I represent for
Holding it, Time is money so I stay late
Holding it, Rhymes cleverly wrote

[Verse 1:] [Makem Pay]
Uh-uh
Damn, they done killed Osama
Next thing you know they gon smoke Obama
I'm alive nigga, living to the fullest yo
Raised by the gun, probably die by the bullet though
I'm loyal, don't know what I do for joke
Shit... The same thing I do for dope
Die with em, ride with em, no questions asked
Just hand me my weapon and mask
Makes a lot befor I leave my house so I'm blessed
And prepared, part of my best
Sleep with one eye open, hand on my hammer
I only watch hands nigga, move I'll blame ya
The worst cross is a double cross
So I maintain focus, salute my soldiers
A hundred man, Lieutenant in this bitch
Damn nigga act crazy, I kill em in this bitch

[Chorus]

[Verse 2:] [Fredro Starr]
And hey we fucking up the hood like the 86 crack invasion
Heard they giving out free joints for tax evasion
Get a Mack truck crash up ya bulletproof car
You tattoos cover up you few good scars
I wake up, a dead body on the front lawn
I'm on the road getting money, on my lawn
This you get mandatory in New York for a gun charge
Thieves on alert, gotta watch for the gun squad
Coolie yo man is getting through hot shit
Key to the schoolio, with the true Glock
They threw shots in his Escalade
They didn't kill him, only thing his bitch breast got grazed
The greatest nation is the donation
I'm in the Porsche with my nigga Pave, fresh offa probation
Mad money nigga knows what up
While you blowing up the stage, we blow your turquois up

[Chorus]
