[Fredro Starr]
Yo! Turn that shit up, word up!
Afficial Nasty Niggas...Fuck Dat!
Ya niggas is dead-ass!
Know what I'm sayin'?
We're payin' my niggas ' All City 'n shit!
Word up! Yo Mega, Fuck Dat!
Rip that Brooklyn shit nigga!

[J. Mega, (Fredro Starr)]
What? What? What? What? What? What?
My fleet goals, by da creep cold
We blaze, y'all won't see those, you just feel 'em
We raise the states in this game, like helium
The new millenium, got me in mo' for killin' 'em
Green backs, I want a mil (of) 'em!
But don't minimum, strictly max out, the ol's put the black out
Niggas be frontin', we take the back rob
Now stay with that style, original, wanna act wild?
City puttin' cartracks out, as we stack now
We're nuthin' to match out, formula
See it clearly through my corner-ya
This goes out to niggas on the corner, Mega's on ya
Rap performer, no diploma, I'm sippin' on Corona, keep my carpet Coma
The East New York Soldier, what?
(Fuck Dat! That's the All City shit!
Yo Greg Valentine!)

[Greg Valentine, (Fredro Starr), {Sticky Fingaz}]
The beats be Rushen like Patrice
You better had that bulletproof vest under ya fleece
Then a clever sceam up ya slees, we has to say da least
Between the thugs and the police, shit'll never be peace
Cause holiday, raise ya weights ya hourly rate
We poly for higher states, buyin' fire escapes
See this, criminal life is like a 'roll it in dice'
Niggas holdin' they ice, wild bust on a slice
Yo it's too often too hot, in this ghetto meldin' pot
Put out these fagat ass niggas try to steel what I got
As if, that ain't enough, for Jakes is ratin' the spot
Where we eat at, but tonight that's where they bleed at
That belone her with the flame, throwin' their rain, it's over
Prayed to Jehova, jiggaz up, the game's over
(All City what, All City what?! Fuck Dat!
Yo Sticky) {wassup nigga?}( Come here nigga, Fuck Dat!
Let these muthafuckaz know nigga!!!) {I want some NEW SHIT!}
(Afficial Nast! What?!!)

[Sticky Fingaz, (Fredro Starr)]
Oh ooh, here the thug come, from out the dungeon
Say goodbye to ya love one, you can't run from, the dum-dum
Kickin' WACK SHIT! I cut out ya tongue son!
I'm in this rap shit for the lump sum
Hit the stage as soon as the blunt's done
YOU DON'T WANT NONE! But regardless
We the wildest, you get demolished
I muthafuckin', muthafuckin' murder, want charges!
Walkin' targets, kill any rap artist!
Still hate ya GUTS!, and hope that ya DIE!
If you not a ally, then yo ass gotta fry
Two lifes for a life without no remorse
You fucked up BIG TIME, you should've finished me off nigga!
(What?! Fuck Dat! Fuck Dat!
Afficial Nast what up?!
Yo Lefty, I got a new nigga for ya niggas!
Yo Fuck Dat! Step up and shit....)

[Bubba Smith, (Fredro Starr), {X-1}]
I roll with gat-swingers, that bay arms like tanktops
A bunch of problem bringers, that an ass bet ya wanna make your bank stop
Guaranteed to make ya block hot, we runnin' the spots
We're tired of jizzle 'n rocks, we straight up fuckin' in villains or jachts
Got the Big Apple on smash like mobbs, we're livin' hell really?!
So we just vanish 'n rob, paper tellin' me we all dyin' from a leg docs(?)
So fuck it, it's even get it get-got, so what?!
Bring it, I'm closin' now shut, I don't give a FUCK about gettin' popped
Them thugs probably heard, left these two guns is al lot!
It's my time to go, playa, I'm tryin' to go spittin' you
For the dolies, niggas just press G-O
While shoot outs, reachin' for the Glocks, on my way to gettin' drugs
Still spittin' ya, 3-60 pill, I was drugged up, in a sixth still SHITTIN' ya
Call it murder, besides anybody TRY to here missin'
(Fuck Dat! Yo X -1 nigga!) {What nigga?}
(Ya betta fuckin' do this shit nigga!) {What what, what, what?!}
(Fuck Dat! Afficial Nasty Niggas!
Fuckin' takin' this streets! That niggas is dead!)

[X-1, (Fredro Starr)]
All you crack niggas, I don't even like your style
If it wasn't for love, you be dead right now
Speak upon the gun nor, X is layin' it down
Dirty two rounds, sprayin' ya town
Takin' dirt back under the ground, be a man, take ya laws
Die with the sacred course, six's bein' deep on the basic floors
(They hate that shit nigga! What?!
Kick the our fuckin' shit! Fuck Dat!)
Be a hard rock and see where you end up 'bout
Before my hart stops, kid I'm tryin' to see some jacks
You better get dropped dog, just read the facts
Dig a gunshot, at least about bringin' you back
I run in cold spots, or walk that for liquid cats
X critical source, with criminal thoughts, under the physical laws
Your visual lost, X-million now, nigga tripple the course
I cripple your boss, what?!!
