[Chorus: samples]
Fuck the police, that’s how I treat ’em
This is war. Cops are gettin’ blasted
Fuck the police, that’s how I treat ’em
Fuck the police, that’s how I treat ’em

[Verse 1: Fredro Starr]
When you're dealin' with the police - get on point chap'd
Black fatigue, civil war, city under siege
We under stress, better get a gun and a vest
Fuck the jake, they should be under arrest
How many black lives do they gotta take?
Marches do we gotta make, out of state?
Sometimes you gotta take matters in your own hand
So get your guns and hold the fort down, just like homeland
A couple Tecs, molotov cocktails
Niggas got Glock shells, the size of ox tails
We lettin' off the Kalashnikov, ambulance drop
The stretches off, I might get a stretch up north

[Chorus: samples]
Fuck the police, that's how I treat 'em
This is war. Cops are gettin' blasted
Fuck the police, that's how I treat 'em
This is war. Cops are gettin' blasted
Fuck the police, that's how I treat 'em
This is war. Cops are gettin' blasted
Fuck the police, that's how I treat 'em
Fuck the police, that's how I treat 'em

[Verse 2: SickFlo]
Black fatigue, no slack (blablaaaat click clack)
The streets catching a fire and the bodies that are stacked are blacks
Jaded authority, parade on slaying minorities
I'm craving and brave enough to snuff the majority
Of these figures, demons in uniforms
Protect and serve as much as the reality of Unicorns
You! Not of the norm, I've been sworn on the corners
Ready to war - they scared of my aura, it's enormous
Routines stop, well my routine's cocked
Blast! Trip & Get your whole blue team shot
Mind illest, militant vigilant swinging tha shotty like I pendulum
Injured 'em, officer down, had to dismember him

[Chorus: samples]
Fuck the police, that's how I treat 'em
This is war. Cops are gettin' blasted
Fuck the police, that's how I treat 'em
This is war. Cops are gettin' blasted
Fuck the police, that's how I treat 'em
This is war. Cops are gettin' blasted
Fuck the police, that's how I treat 'em
Fuck the police, that's how I treat 'em

[Verse 3: Sticky Fingaz]
I need my point blank vest metal plate in the chest
It all black fatigue cuz I never can rest
From the blood in my veins to the blows in my flesh
You gon' need a eye witness cuz I never confess
I got guns waiting to shoot but we're gonna need more
Just call me the spook who sat by the door
Damn right we gonna loot it, burn down the store
But not in our hood it's time we come into yours
We see it on the news but all of us fucking living
Fuck these politicians, all of 'em fuckin' bigots
Brothers getting sentences, all in the double digits
Even white boys is calling each other niggas

[Chorus: samples]
Fuck the police, that's how I treat 'em
This is war. Cops are gettin' blasted
Fuck the police, that's how I treat 'em
This is war. Cops are gettin' blasted
Fuck the police, that's how I treat 'em
This is war. Cops are gettin' blasted
Fuck the police, that's how I treat 'em
Fuck the police, that's how I treat 'em
