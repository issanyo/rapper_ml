[Intro:]
Polo wars
You know I'm saying
What you know about that shit
Take it back to that man on the horse
Er'body run around in all this clothes
From Italy and Paris and France and all that
C'mon man, Its that real New York shit
Late night battles on em hallway steps
Southside Queens I'mma always rep
Half the rap game went all the way left
Respect the mic skills, what I always stress
Got that project hallway flow, all they know
Getting fresh spending up all they doe
We was just shopping, for all they know
We was runnin’ outa Macy's we all lay low
See the po-po, we jet like Broadway Joe
Then it's back to these project hallways yo
Where they talk about Polo, all day yo
Teddy bears and ski mask is all they know
Doing pull-ups in the park tryna get the arms strong like BJ
Fucking with them bitches out in BK
Nigga even started rocking DK
Give up the D-I-C-K
We was shading low before ebay
E&J spilling on my beef and brocs
Nigga freestyling at the reefers spot
Niggas not knowing if it’s beef or not
With the Tommy jeans, with the Polo fleece on top
Now Ralph dont want black kids to wear they gear
White kids tryna figure how they wear they hair
Got nigga fresh to death, everyday they here
Cuz roll with Hilfigers, everyday they wear
I swear, cross my heart to the horse on my chest
Obsessed with cookies on the Polo quest
Like the nigga Naz said, nothing less than Guess
Big American flag on the damn crew's vest
Its Polo sport, U.S.A
Georgetown trunks, yeah, the blue and grey
Queens roller rink, U.S.A
Where shit pops off like two SKs
Up in U.S.A, all the barrels have low on
Brooklyn, Queens, and so on and so on
Raised in a city where anything can go wrong
You can get shot for your ski man coat on

[Chorus:]
Lo wars [lo wars]
Lo wars [lo wars]
You can get shot for your ski man coat on
