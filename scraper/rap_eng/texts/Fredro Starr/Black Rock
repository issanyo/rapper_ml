[Intro: Fredro Starr & sample of KRS-One]
Black rock! Black rock, black rock, black rock
Three, two

[Verse 1: Fredro Starr]
KRS-One, he explained black cop
We mix it with guitars and we made it “Black Rock”
We slam in the club and you can still get shot
I’m on my Diddy bop, lemonade and Ciroc
I jump off the stage with my chain and my watch
Get back on stage with my chain and my watch
Where New York at? Damn, we miss Big Pop?
Got West Coast love, wish I could bring back Pac
I’m in the back drop, the haters gotta love
I keep a Glock in my “Rock & Republic”, make me pop off in public
Broad day people watch and do nothing
They stop and start running and gunning, then cock it and dump it
Now niggas wanna change the topic or subject
Hip-hop ain’t dead yet, it just got shot in the stomach
They throw their gats like us, when they act like us
But nobody on the corner got ratchets like us

[Chorus: Fredro Starr, *DJ Nelson*, sample of KRS-One]
Black rock! Black rock, black rock, black rock
Black rock! Black rock *Whatcha*
Black rock! Black rock, black rock, black rock
*Get the fuck outta* Black rock! Black rock
Three, two

[Verse 2: Sticky Fingaz]
Yo I’m Black Rock, i'm all skull and bones
I'm heavy metal mostly the lead and chrome
I'm coming back from hell and I’m headed home
You're nobody till they kill you and you're dead and gone
My niguh Dro got tats I only got scars
My skateboards is luxury cars
See women are from Venus and men are from Mars
I shot for a sky, missed, now I'm amongst the stars
And I ain’t no alkie, I know my limit
Shit, I always stop drinking when the room starts spinning
When I’m up in the spot I command attention
My name’s Sticky Fingaz but my hands be itching
From Carhartt to Chrome watch surprised i'm breathing
I sleep with the sunrise and wake up in the evening
I'm on the prowl like I never say vows I’m too wild

[Chorus: Fredro Starr, *DJ Nelson*]
Black rock! Black rock, black rock, black rock
Black rock! Black rock
Black rock! Black rock, black rock, black rock
*Get the fuck outta* Black rock! Black rock

[Scratches: DJ Nelson]
*Get the fuck outta*
