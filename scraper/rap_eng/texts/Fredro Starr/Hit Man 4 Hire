[Intro:]
[?] nigga
Bang Bang Rizzla Gang

[Verse 1:] [Philly Swain]
Straight out the gutter
Where they bangs for the butter
Sling my guns in the air
Slam on you
Word to mother
Uhh
Think you sweet motherfucker
Try to creep
We put you to sleep like under covers
Hey Fredro
The gas light petrol
Throwing down bullets
Like you young [?]
Talking to the echo
Go harder from the get go
Start to get retarded
Cause the [?] ain’t special
Bad bitch mami
Throw it back like retro
Hittin up on lunch break
Fuckin up her schedule
These same folks will be
Dullin up the metal
Usain Bolt when I’m runnin from the bezzle
Throwing in ghosts
Still runnin with the metal
They used to go
Where you from
Man I’m from the ghetto
And I run at a higher level

[Interlude]
Hey yo Swain
Job well done my nigga
Hold that right there
That’s you
Yo i’m go throw in a couple links man
There’s more niggas we gotta kill out here

[Verse 2:] [Fredro Starr]
Yeah, yeah
I’m the fire man
Uh, Ferrari diagrams
Make it hard to breathe
Two shots to your diaphram
[?] money on the floor
25 grand
Straight out the frying pan
You land in the fire
Uh Philly Swain
Hit man 4 hire
Sink more niggas in quicksand
If you even bait me
I put the four [?] in your bank man
I’m in the 458 with the millicopter
Your boy keep it tighter than the Philly blocker
For the dough motherfuckers get red up
Catch a cold (cough cough)
Cough the bread up
I’m dead up
I got the Feds running my plates
Without a warrant
The Feds can’t run in my place
I know the fuckboys comin for the safe
Cause they heard it got a chief
Got a hundred fo the 8
Gun in my waist
No safety on
Bullets tap dance on your back
Safety on
Case niggas try to play me wrong
It’s a suicide
It’s a suicide
Suicide from the south
Suicide to the 215
Uh
Hit Man 4 Hire [x4]
