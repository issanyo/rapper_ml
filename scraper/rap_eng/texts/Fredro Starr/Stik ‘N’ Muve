[Intro: Sonee Seeza, Sticky Fingaz, (Fredro Star)]
Oh, shit!
Yo, y’knahmsayin?
That shit just shot duke in the face
(That nigga right there!)
Nigga gotta be dead
Fuck that then, let’s rob that nigga, man
Take that nigga watch and get the fuck out of here
Fuck him!
(Aiyo, young brothers out there)
(Shouldn't be sticking up people y’know?)

[Verse 1: Sonee Seeza]
Gimme the money, gimme the money
Here comes Sonee the greaser
Seize the hostages
My conscience keeps tellin’ me I should just
Hit ’em high, hit ’em low
Everywhere I go there’s no
Coppers could stop us
The pros, our motto is

[Chorus: Sonee Seeza]
Stik ‘n’ move, stik ‘n’ move
Stik ‘n’ move, stik ‘n’ move

[Verse 2: Fredro Starr]
8 o’clock in the morning time to wake up
Another brother getting paid in a way it’s a stick up
No time to even take a bath
Strictly cash tax free quick fast
Grab my Polo, jumped in the Timberland boots
I got Audi, time to get rowdy
Shiftee, low down gritty and grimy
I guess I got to find my crimey
Sticky Fingaz, yo, that Sticky Fingaz
Jetted to the ave in a half of a second
He wasn’t at the spot so the stop I was checkin’
Met him on the way, tucked away was the weapon

[Chorus: Fredro Starr]
Stik ‘n’ move, stik ‘n’ move
Stik ‘n’ move, stik ‘n’ move

[Verse 3: Sticky Fingaz, (Fredro Starr)]
Single handed me and Mickey Billy took a trip to Linden
Picked up some cheeba and brew, yo what else we need? (Nothin’)
Now we on the E-train back to Archer and (Sutphin)
Oops, it’s our stop, the 40-deuce get loose
See three other trooper and they tried to call a truce
One had a link, the other a goose
You know what we took and you know what we left
But the third one played a punk, he dissed his posse and stepped
With Sticky on the loose there was nothing he could do
So I pulled out the old taped-up .22
But that was only petty, skills a Philly get ready

[Chorus: Sticky Fingaz]
Stik ‘n’ move, stik ‘n’ move
Stik ‘n’ move, stik ‘n’ move

[Verse 4 Fredro Starr]
Yeah-yeah, hand over the money
Don’t get like “doc, what’s up, doc?” This is Muggs Bunny
Ain’t nuttin’ funny, ha it’s a stick up
Sticky got sticky and tricky with the wallet
But this ain’t El Segundo
It’s just the four, bad, brothers from the ghetto

[Chorus: Fredro Starr]
Stik ‘n’ move, stik ‘n’ move
Stik ‘n’ move, stik ‘n’ move

[Verse 5: Sticky Fingaz, (Fredro Starr)]
We had an option after 12 in the city
Man, we gonna roll on some Chez Whitey nitty
But first we got trips because the man got geased
Yo mister I just got robbed, have you seen the police?
(Nah, none over here) Good, so run all your gear
Rolex watch, rings, the Gucci underwear
You might think I’m sorta outta order but I’ll rob you for a quarter
Chez Whitey you’s a goner
You’s a gonna wanna call the pork
Pig, ya dig, police, peace

[Chorus: Sticky Fingaz, (Fredro Starr)]
Stik ‘n’ move (Stik-stik-stick)
Stik ‘n’ move (Stik ‘n’ move, stik ‘n’ move)
Stik ‘n’ move (Stik-stik-stick)
Stik ‘n’ move

[Outro: Fredro Starr, (Sticky Fingaz)]
Aiyyo, young brothers out here
Shouldn’t be stickin’ up people y’know?
(That’s a no-no)
This is a story about Sticky Fingaz and Mickey Billy’s show
And there was a…
(Stik ‘n’ move, stik ‘n’ move)
(Stik ‘n’ move, stik ‘n’ move)
(Stik ‘n’ move, stik ‘n’ move)
(Stik ‘n’ move, stik ‘n’ move)
(Stik ‘n’ move, stik ‘n’ move)
(Stik ‘n’ move, stik ‘n’ mooooove)
(Stik ‘n’ move!)
Yeah-yeah, hand over the money
Yeah-yeah
(Gimme the money, gimme the money)
Yeah-yeah, hand over the money
Yeah-yeah
(Gimme the money, gimme the money)
(Hit 'em high, hit 'em low)
(Gimme the money, gimme the money)
(Hit 'em high, hit 'em low)
(Gimme the money, gimme the money)
(Hit 'em high, hit 'em low)
(Gimme the money, gimme the money)
(Hit 'em high, hit 'em low)
(Gimme the money, gimme the money)
Yeah yeah, hand over the money
