[Intro: Jay Reaper]
Dope D.O.D., Onyx
One, two, yeah we comin' for your crew
Three, four, my niggas knocking on your door
Five, six, we're pissed and we're equiped
Seven, eight, nine, ten, we comin so it's best you don't sleep

[Verse 1: Jay Reaper]
I hear you motherfuckers is testin' me
They, wanna get the best of me
Best believe they won't let me breathe
So I need a little stress relief
I need little extra cheese
I need little extra weed
Before I lose my shit and make you bitch ass nigga rest in peace
Goddamn! Put the gun in my hand
Nigga I'mma blam like a mexican stand off
I'mma shut your straps so you can't talk
Nigga that check, hand off
I never been a fan, no
Rip that ass, I'm like Hancock
These niggas is brain washed
That's why we're going hard and you stay soft

[Verse 2: Skits Vicious]
Freddy Krueger left the building
Jason took the kids to camp
Trick or treat I pull the heat and show you how to rob a bank
Michael Myers came for Christmas
Chucky had some different plans
Guess that means I'm next in land to catch you with an empty tank
I'm a motherfucker monster bitch, lay eggs bigger than an ostrich
Oyster slam on my upper lip
Plastic Glock with a box of bricks
Hardcore crew with a bunch of hits
What's that ringing with a hundred chicks
No one back when she cross the bridge
They all lay flat when I pop the clip

[Verse 3: Fredro Starr]
Smoking blunts with Ted Bundy
Charles Manson drinking Miller's
Tell me what's your sign bitch, I'm the Zodiac Killer
Yeah I'm the lady killer, bitches call me Jack Ripper
Niggas call me Jeffrey Dahmer 'cause I'm eating all you niggas
Shittin' on niggas, colostomy
Put a cut on your face like an apostrophe
Get a gun, I ain't no boxer to beat
.38 fucking straighten up your posture G
I'll make a catastrophe, get skeet up with a ski mask for me
A runaway slave with a master keys
Fuck the world, you're going after me
Crime for a day, yeah purge's back
Killing these niggas with these murder raps
Steals on niggas, yeah burglars back
Push a nigga fucking wig further back
People's always told me I ain't shit
You know what bitch? I ain't shit
Put a gun to your head, now watch your brain
That's what I'm painting that wall with

[Verse 4: Sticky Fingaz]
Hmmm, what's worse than killing you?
Let you live, life would be miserable
Look at you, you're fucking pitiful
Stop, know we niggas bringing death to you
Beat with fists on tell who running
Think of your child, what you wanna do for it?
Your face, my fist or get a gun
Think you know me? Just get you a blunt
God struck you punch, dudes see me up
Niggas do a lot of sound for a loot or money
Squad must be runnin', they ain't see it coming
Niggas give it up or they ain't getting shit from me
Hocus pocus, you should be gone
Abracadabra now you see, now you don't
I'll make you disappear right into thin air
Shoot you in Hell with this sawn off right here
