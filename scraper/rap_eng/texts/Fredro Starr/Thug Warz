[Hook]
All my real street niggas throw your guns up
Throw your guns up, throw your guns up

I'd rather have enemies
Cause fear last longer than love
In the streets nothing stronger than thug
We all bleed the same color
Weather you a Crip or a Blood
You want more you'll be comin with slugs

[Verse 1: Fredro Starr]
Yo Yo
The head nigga in charge, king of New York
Greatest of all time, you wanna talk streets lets talk
WE ARE THE STREETS, forever check my war report
Theres no way out except entertainment, drugs and sports
Feds try to shut us down, without a reasonable doubt
Supreme Clientele legal drug money on paper routes
Till the death do us part for money, power, respect
My road to riches No one dies like life after death
Its hell on earth, the block is hot 400 degreez
The truth jealous will envy all eyez on me
A top dogg said the game is to be sold not told
Pulled out the ill-matic 16 shots to your dome
Capital punishment black trash trapped in crime
The ghetto's trying to kill me, license to ill criminal mind
The understanding was a comin' of age
We nigga'z fo' life, disaster strikes on Judgement Day

[Hook: 2x]
I'd rather have enemies
Cause fear last longer than love
In the streets nothing stronger than thug
We all bleed the same color
Weather you a Crip or a Blood
You want more you'll be comin with slugs

[Verse 2: Napoleon]
I ain't got time for dem lies, I gotta get mines
Muthafucka ask Shyne he'll tell you I rise
Do 'em dirty this time, worked with Phillis this time
You outta line tryin' to war with us shootin' that nine
Gotta our back against the wall, so its ball or die'
Outlaw (wha') cause of course u hate it, watch how we rise
Nigga I street talk, the gangsta' walk to be like this
Then I load 'em up, one by one shootin' dont miss
It's a critical game, we pledge plead for this blood
If you a thug it don't matter, the crypt fo' this cuz
Outlaw mutha, fucka then bust yo' rocket
Firestarr ~ n ~ other people attack yo' pocket

[E.D.I. Mean]
Yo' it's serious biz-, we hand deliver this shit
If you want, it's door to door service
Hand 'em and scream makes it more worth it
Hold up I'm lying Cause shit I'm gettin' money now
So I drop fifty thou. and take a trip back to the isle
Come back to the states like "shit what a vacation"
My mind on Makaveli and this money we taken'
I'm gonna bust 'em and then vacate the scene
Before the sireen's scream, 2001 look how my team gleam
Comin' up quick, like we out there pitchin' them birdies
Terrorize the whole game, with my nigga'z from Jersey
And if you in tha way well shit you be there long (huh)
We head strong, so fuck it nigga let'z get it on

[Hook: 2x]
All my real street niggas throw your guns up
Throw your guns up, throw your guns up

[Hook: 2x]
I'd rather have enemies
Cause fear last longer than love
In the streets nothing stronger than thug
We all bleed the same color
Weather you a Crip or a Blood
You want more you'll be comin with slugs
