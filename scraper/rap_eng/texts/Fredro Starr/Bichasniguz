[Verse 1: Fredro Starr]
If the heat is on I gotta freeze a frontin’ nigga
Shit’ll hit the fan from the hand squeeze the trigger
Attack of the bald heads, sleep if ya wanna
Beds is burned, ya step to this you’ll be a goner
Bitch ass niggas not respected but neglected
Move on ‘em, move on ‘em things’ll get hectic
So watch ya pockets, hold ya, ho
Ya get hurt up, that’s the word up, fuckin’ with Fredro
Understand god damn, who the hell is that little ass man?
The kid with the scams for all the tight jams
Shootin’ at the stands, sometimes I grease the fans
Ain’t nothin’ worse than a bitch ass
Or which ass nigga that’s fakin,’ lies for attention'
Try to ride a nut for a scratch so stop itchin’
Wishin’ perhaps I play the right guard
Tryin’ to gain yards but I’ma hit ya with sacks
Two to the temple straight to the brain
So simple and plain, ain’t a mother fuckin’ thing change
But a hole in ya motherfuckin tank
I would like to thank my nigga
My nigga, my nigga
My nigga, nigga-nigga-nigga

[Chorus: Fredro Starr & Bid DS]
Bichasniguz, I’mma have to pull ya skirt up
Bichasniguz, I’mma have to pull ya skirt up
Bichasniguz, I’mma have to pull ya skirt up
That’s da word up, you get hurt up
Bichasniguz, I’mma have to pull ya skirt up
Bichasniguz, I’mma have to pull ya skirt up
Bichasniguz, I’mma have to pull ya skirt up
That’s da word up, you get hurt up

[Verse 2: Big DS]
Big DS, I’ll put a hole in ya chest
Grab ya by the neck, I hit you with the tek
Onyx in effect, we always come correct
Smack the taste out ya motherfuckin’ mouth
Big DS, I show ya what it’s all about
Danger-danger, danger-danger
It’s all about anger, the nigga bitch banger

[Chorus: Bid DS & Sonsee]
Bichasniguz, I’mma have to pull ya skirt up
Bichasniguz, I’mma have to pull ya skirt up
Bichasniguz, I’mma have to pull ya skirt up
That’s da word up, you get hurt up
Bichasniguz, I’mma have to pull ya skirt up
Bichasniguz, I’mma have to pull ya skirt up
Bichasniguz, I’mma have to pull ya skirt up
That’s da word up…

[Verse 3: Sonsee]
I be with the crazy criminals from the pistol projects
Beatin ‘em down, who we suspect to fake moves
They play the bitch ass
Your choice is dead or death you choose
Make a bitch nigga silent as a bad case of strep throat
Wild crazy klepto keepin’ ‘em all petro
Duck kids on the block gettin’ hot with the rocks
When the time hit the clock I knock ‘em right out they Reeboks
That’s my word
I hit a slick city kid or a herb from the suburbs
Bullets can’t discriminate so I won’t either
Make you holier than a bible if you not a believer
This ya worst dream when ya face my team
Bend a bitch nigga over like the house of pain make ‘em scream
When I get you I say “Gimme that bitch ass
Slice ya throat with glass, get you a cast or a ditch fast”

[Bridge: Onyx]
Ain’t nuthin’ worse than a bitch ass nigga
Ain’t nuthin’ worse than a bitch ass nigga

[Verse 4: Sticky Fingaz]
Move back motherfuckers, the Onyx is here
My name is Sticky Fingaz, I’m the nigga in your nightmare
Forget the crowd cheers, I live off fears
It’s the beast in me, even the music couldn’t sooth me
It’ll take more than U-Haul if ya tryin’ to move me
Ya see I wrote the rhyme, but it’s the weed talkin’
(All ya bitch ass niggas best just keep walkin’)
Before I spit in ya face, Onyx is the master race
Ain’t nothing sweet about me G so stay in a child’s place
With God as my witness, I broke the law
And had bitch ass niggas in jail washin’ my drawers
Hit the floors and do crazy calisthenics
Then when they try to flip they take a trip to the paramedics
(Cause ain’t nuthin’ worse than a bitch ass nigga)
Talk a lot of shit, throw a punch and run
I have blood on my knife and a body on my gun
So listen up, son, don’t act wild
Or I’ll cramp ya style with a bullet and a smile

[Outro: Sticky Fingaz]
Cause ain’t nuthin’ worse than a bichasnigga
(Ain’t nuthin’ worse than a bichasnigga)
(Ain’t nuthin’ worse than a bichasnigga)
(Ain’t nuthin’ worse than a bichasnigga)
(Ain’t nuthin’ worse than a bichasnigga)
That’s the word up, you get hurt up!
