[Intro: Fredro Starr]
Go Rambo, go Rambo
Go Rambo, go Rambo
Go Rambo, go Rambo
Go Rambo, go Rambo

[Verse 1: Fredro Starr]
Why you hatin’ on fire niggas can’t knock the game
Cause we let the top drop like the stock exchange
Click sittin’ on quarters like pocket change
Yo [?] trade the six for the Aqua Range
You can catch me testin’ toasters, out the testarosta
Sparking Hershey in the nestle roster
I got a vest tech next to holster
Try to front get your face left next to posters
You ain't blastin’ at starr, only you use a pump nigga
Is when you gassin’ your car (Ayo God!)
I caught a ticket in my drop at the light
Cause my rims started speedin’ when I stopped at the light
Now chicks want to suck up
Car doors open like them shits gettin’ stuck up
Cause it’s a Lambo and we chillin’ in the club
And got more ammo than Rambo

[Chorus: [?], Fredro Starr, (T Hussle)]
24’s on the coupe boy (That’s how we roll)
On tour getting loot boy (That’s how we roll)
22’s in the boot boy (That’s how we roll)
Not only guns, movie shoots boy, true boys
We stay wheelin’ in the Benz ma (That’s how we roll)
Yeah, I’m chilling’ with my friends ma (That’s how we roll)
You need to call your friends ma (That’s how we roll)
And we can all get bent ma. You get high?

[Verse 2: [?]]
You can catch Ickarus in the candy hummer
Tryin’ to get Fredro to give me Brandy Number
We make it hotter than Miami summer
Feds takin’ flicks while Sticky hand me somethin’
It’s me and Fire in the Lamborghini Mya
Two cats stay out in Brooklyn and Queens and Mayer
Rims doin’ cartwheels, whip late spot
Team Bartwell, this the GMG cartel
Ick is a mobster, that is quicker to spark ya
Burn Bikes on the turn pipes, liftin’ the Honda
What is you dealin’ with, we all spillin’ clips
If you fillin’ this (Yeah Ick you killin’ it)
It get realer when I feel ’em with six cases
Now I’m in LA six for when spinnin’ Dayton’s
I’ve been amazing, I was raised in a place
Where we blazin’, but cause we caged in

[Chorus: Fredro Starr, [?], (T Hussle)]
24’s on the coupe boy (That’s how we roll)
On tour getting loot boy (That’s how we roll)
22’s in the boot boy (That’s how we roll)
Not only guns, movie shoots boy, true boys
We stay wheelin’ in the Benz ma (That’s how we roll)
Yeah, I’m chilling’ with my friends ma (That’s how we roll)
You need to call your friends ma (That’s how we roll)
And we can all get bent ma. You get high?

[Outro: Fredro Starr]
Go Rambo, go Rambo
Go Rambo, go Rambo
Go Rambo, go Rambo
Go Rambo, go Rambo
