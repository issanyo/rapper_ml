[Intro:]
Hell Yeah
Is everybody having a good time?
Stick up kids is off for the night, you know I'm saying
Young star in the building
He's representing that real hip-hop tonight
Audible Doctor

[Verse 1:]
Came through the roof, what a way to make an entrance
Straight from the hood, a nigga tryna make a difference
With persistence, with this rap thing
A nigga fucking made it out the ghetto
Cuz I keep running like straight like metal
And I took my time with the rhyme like niggas camping out
Thinking other ways to get paid, Now I'm helpin out
The Bent coup or the Tes drop, I'm here to wreck shop
Walk on beats like an ex-cop
Direct shots for you niggas talking indirectly
Cuz only then you would respect me
Then I bet we, be the talk in all the barber shops
I got the right Gizilo flow, I got these bars on lock
This bar hot to the next one, Word, the X1
I make New York feel like the jets won
And yes son, I got the automatic in the waist
And yeah, I got the baddest chick in the place
And she's the one that makes me feel alright
Hommie like, "god damn, where you find them Dro?"
I rip the mic one time then it's time to go
So, dont give a fuck who you came to see
Cuz at the end of the night, I'mma be the main MC
So baby girl, it's now or nothing
We bout to slide off, power button

[Chorus:]
We don't wanna hear you problems, fuck what you going through
The world don't owe you nothing, fuck what you going through
Shawty back it up, shake your waistline
My killas in the back put your nines back in yo waist
We don't wanna hear you problems, fuck what you going through
The world don't owe you nothing, fuck what you going through
Shawty back it up, shake your waistline
My killas in the back put your nines back in yo waistline

[Verse 2:]
Alright I'm back on track, the boy is back on his run too
It was all a dream but a nigga made it come through
I come though in a whip that make the chicks stare
When it come to Jordan 3s, I'm already on my fifth pair
I switch gears in this subject, ain't no drugs yes
But you heart beating like a dubset
The thug rep. getting tested, you get a F
So get a vest for yo chest if you scared to death
I'm fresh to death like a nigga in a casket
When I put these niggas in check they can't cash it
I get cash with the mad money quick
With no sweat, I can bag a bad hundred quick
With the honey that I'm with, man she stacked up
You hear that 'wooo- wooo' sound when she backup
I'm bout to wrap up and get up outta here
Before these crazy niggas get somebody fucking shot in here

[Chorus]
