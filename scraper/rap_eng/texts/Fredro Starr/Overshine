* hidden track after "The Worst"

[Sticky Fingaz]
Follow my footsteps, used to ante up for a nickel sack
From Vange Hill to Moon, you touch me, I got to get you back
Roll in the stolen V's with he-ho chase you
Cop a six months time, and 3 years probation
Repeat offender, bender, no retreat, no surrender
I'm the number one contender
I got a new game plan, strictly sportin name brand
Layin in the pound hunted, floatin through your town blunted
On some shit that give you burnt throats
Amputated all the turn coats, and get cremated
Never been B-rated, my 5 plated, is how I dead fights
I have your family driving in the daytime wit they head lights

[Hook: All City]
(Keep Shinin)I'm daily thinkin of a life gleamin
That life we in, how to obtain, and what's the meanin
(Keep on Shinin)The fact that cash rules, these last days
We the last crews, my present wars and my past crews
(Keep Shinin)True soldier, no matter the goal
We gettin closer, for bitch ass niggas, it's just about over
I'm in it for the long haul, this goes out
(Keep on Shinin)To all my true livin dogs and my 'so-called'

[Fredro Starr]
Don't talk about it, make it happ'
Don't fake it chap
The Hennessy act, got you light gat
You wanna block, trying to hold a nine
Son you livin on my time, don't try to Overshine
Play your p, play your position
I stay with G, stay on a mission
Precisely, good, wit game I'm nicely
Shifftee son, still shiesty
You in your eight fifty, ridin shotgun
If you can count your money, you ain't got none
And bitches beat they game tight
Baby, get the name right, see G. comin, like a train light
And niggas be don pretending
But I'm armed and bendin, so they can get the John Lennon
Hundred dollar gator players
Silk shirts and champagne, don't know a thing about the damn game

[Sonsee]
My artistic creation, or decoration will set the nation
With infestation of lyric lacin, for all occasions
Engagements and events, for big dollars and cents
Makin niggas past tense, it's consequence
All I see around me, makes up the place
But if you don't hold down your space, you quickly get erased
Don't waste a thought, thinkin I ain't
Gon' be bringin the goods and grands home
Till my body's dead and stinkin
Watch as I back draft, on the last class, I trap, crash
Catch the hash flash, when I puff the black wrath
Learn the slicks of the trade, to be self made
Those who slept, stay where they started and got played

[Hook]
