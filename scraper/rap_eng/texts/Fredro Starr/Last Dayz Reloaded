South suicide Queens
Brooklyn
All my soldiers gather up all your arms
Let's go to war niggas
Onyx, Dead Prez

[Verse 1 - Fredro Starr]
This is America's nightmare
Red, black, green and don't give a fuck
Just wanna get free and live it up
Fuck a 9 to 5, and labels trying to slave us
Busting 12 gauges, breaking your minds out the cages
Crips and bloods banging in New York, that's outrageous
Protesting is hopeless
We putting lasers and scopes on the toasters
Shooting at the police in the streets is the focus
Roll with the rush, it's that official nas
Got soldiers with pistols that blast
We living in the last
My theory is fuck it until the system ain't corrupted
To the public I'm conducted through ghetto clips and armor metal
Busting at the feds or Berettas, we never settle
Til the Rockefeller laws get better
We all trapped in the hood fucking all together
It's war forever
So guns up, if the cops run up on ya
Hold down your corner, and cock a four pound on em

[Verse 2 - M1]
Multiple shots, heard on the block
And my niggas is popping the cops
All up in the hood, it's hot
Living life with my back against the wall, it's over
Open and sober, holding pistolas and repping my culture
Get it or die trying, us against them, freedom or death
This how we on it when it ain't nothing left
Ain't getting locked up no more, ain't buying your raw
Rocking it up, coming for mine, cocking it up
This is the last day, hour, minute and second
So I'm screaming "fuck they law," and carry my weapon
Warrior code, shoot and reload, and we taking back what we are owed
We dividing it with my soldiers
You dare to struggle, you dare to win
To the OGs and the veterans, spreading that ghetto medicine
This is my last day, on my word and my balls
When the people army rise, then the system will fall

[Hook]
These the last dayz (get yours!) (repeat x4)

[Verse 3 - stic.man]
Just talking bout takin my own life
Into my own hands
RBG, refine, be a grown man
See that's what I'm doing, cause I know it's inside of me
All I gotta do is just bring it to reality, it's
Fuck the government, but still I gotta pay the rent
So yeah, I'm for the caper most definite
Keeping it militant, focused, intelligent
Pimping the system is basic common sense
It's still fuck the pig, black power ain't dead
All that red, white, and blue shit be going to y'all head, see
We break bread, it's like a game or a sport
Gotta train everyday to keep your team on point
Cause still to this day our reparations ain't paid
And you can see it in the poverty around the way
It ain't even our own people on BET
So they gotta get it from somebody, it might as well be me
Besides, a nigga gotta eat when he hungry
You see how they sent troops to war for they country
Niggas worldwide need an army of one
This revolution to the fullest, put the bullets in the gun nigga

[Hook]
These the last dayz (get yours!) (repeat x8)

[Verse 4 - Sticky Fingaz]
Ayo these niggas in the streets ain't ready for no revolution
But neither am I, I'm at the club getting stupid
I ain't got no time to think about who's really oppressing me
I'm too ready to smash the first nigga stressing me
Far as I'm concerned they got us trained so well
Look like we doing a good job of killing ourselves
It don't take heart to pull a trigger, so I'm glad that I'm heartless
Killing easy, living with it was the hard shit
I done broke every rule in the Good Book
Trust me, I memorized The Anarchist's Cookbook
This nigga here ain't as dumb as you think
I could make a bomb with the shit that's under your sink
My name is a number, they trying violate my probation
Fuck it!
Throw me in jail, I need a vacation
Our future is fucked, it don't do no use to pray
My views is the same views of the youth today
The last dayz nigga

These the last dayz (get yours!)
