[Verse 1]
Flip this capital eclipse
The vocal tone has got 'em sweating their own apocalypse
Yes, rebel of the grains stand masterless
The masked ones cap one, NAFTA coming with the new disaster
And yes we in with the wind and the Plan de Ayala kin
Coming back around again
The slave driver saliva, one night, power turns
Them devils mouths dry, now Mexico burns
So here they come, one by one them killers of the new frontier
Occupy, causing fear, come on...

[Chorus]
With the wind below!
We in with the wind below!
With the wind below!

[Verse 2]
Flip this capital eclipse
Them bury life wit IMF shifts, and poison lips
Yo they talk it, while slicing our veins, yo so mark it
From the FINCAS overseers, to them vultures playing markets
She ain't got nothing but weapon and shawl
She is Chol, Tzotzil, Tojolobal, Tzeltal
The tools are her tools, Ejidos and ovaries
She once struggled, now through a barrel she breathes

[Chorus]
She is the wind below!
The wind below!
She is the wind below!

[Bridge]
And all the shareholders gonna flex, and try to annex the truth
While the new trust is gonna flex, and cast their image in you
Yeah, all the shareholders gonna flex, and try to annex the truth
And while the new trust tries to flex, and cast their image in you
And GE is gonna flex and try and annex the truth
And NBC is gonna flex and cast their image in you
And Disney bought the fantasies and piles of eyes
And ABC's new thrill rides, of trials and lies
And while the gut eaters strain to pull the mud from their mouths
They force our ears to go deaf to the screams in the south, yeah

[Outro]
But we in with the wind below
But we in with the wind below
But we in with the wind below
