[Verse 1]
They say that in war the truth be the first casualty, so I
Dig in selector, I the resurrector, fly my shit
Sever your neck wider than ever, with my
Tongue dipped in funk arsenic
Burn this illusion, this lie, with straight arson shit
Your arsenal stripped
Power ain't full jackets, and clips, it's
My ability to define phenomenon, raw
Crenshaw '84, boogie down before
L.A, when the war break off, where you be take off
Stand in full face off with the M1 millimeter
Let the rhythm of the chamber hit 'em
Let the rich play catch wit' 'em
Better yet make 'em eat 'em and shit 'em 'til they
So full of holes that they drown in their own
I'm like a nail stuck in the wrist of they Christmas
Don't need radio to leave they family a witness

[Chorus]
Muhammad and Christ would life, would lay your body down
To a tune so wild international
In the desert, full of bullets let your body rot
With my chrome, with my verse, with my body rock

Both Muhammad and Christ would lay your body down
To a tune so wild international
In the desert, full of bullets let your body rot
With my chrome, with my verse

[Verse 2]
In this era where DJs behave, be paid to be slaves
We raid airwaves to be sane, and
What's rainin' from the station
Cash fascination, like livin' dead Fed agents
Distract us fast from a disaster's wrath for sure
Air war was flooded like the 9th ward
On the AM, on the AM, turn and face them
Hatred and mayhem, slay them, dangerous I take razor steps
It's the swing from the bling to the bang on the left
It's the murderous return, boom back full strap
Your six that got clipped you can't clap back
With minimal lift and criminal flow
Iâ€™m killin' them soft and billin' them for
Everything stole
And once again I'm that nail in the wrist of they Christmas
Watch me make they family a witness

[Chorus]
Muhammad and Christ word life, would lay your body down
To a tune so wild international
In the desert, full of bullets let your body rot
With my chrome, with my verse, with my body rock

Both Muhammad and Christ would lay your body down
To a tune so wild international
In the desert, full of bullets, let your body rot
With my chrome, with my verse, with my body rock

[Bridge]
International
International

[Chorus]
Muhammad and Christ would life, would lay your body down
To a tune so wild international
In the desert, full of bullets let your body rot
With my chrome, with my verse, with my body rock

Both Muhammad and Christ would lay your body down
To a tune so wild international
In the desert, full of bullets, let your body rot
With my chrome, with my verse, with my body rock
