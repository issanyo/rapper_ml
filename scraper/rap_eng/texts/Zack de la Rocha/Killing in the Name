[Hook]
Killing in the name of...

[Verse 1]
Some of those that work forces, are the same that burn crosses
Some of those that work forces, are the same that burn crosses

[Hook]
Ugh!
Killing in the name of...
Killing in the name of...

[Pre-Chorus 1]
And now you do what they told ya
And now you do what they told ya
And now you do what they told ya
You're under control, do what they told ya

[Chorus]
Those who died are justified
For wearing the badge, they're the chosen whites
You justify those that died
By wearing the badge, they're the chosen whites

[Bridge]
C'mon, ugh
Yeah, c'mon

[Outro]
Fuck you, I won't do what you tell me
Fuck you, I won't do what you tell me
Fuck you, I won't do what you tell me
Fuck you, I won't do what you tell me
Mother fucker!
Bang bang boom bang!
