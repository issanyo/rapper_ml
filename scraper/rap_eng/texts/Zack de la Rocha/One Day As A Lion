[Pre-Verse x2]
Blood! Soaked! Earth! That you call home!

[Verse 1]
Close your eyes but don't sleep
We comin' like People's Army
For the people who can't eat
Who work with no sleep
For the child with no shoes on their feet
A generation who flash heat
Roll up on banks for they cash, see
You're a criminal? You got the nerve to ask me
Tear mics 'til my voice get raspy
Faced flame for five centuries
And if LA were Baghdad, we'd be Iraqi
With our straps in the backseat next to a general
Tied up with shit in his khakis

[Pre-Chorus x2]
Best leave my mic alone, I'm full grown
And I'm off to the green zone

[Chorus x2]
After dark my city's a fuse
After dark my city's a fuse
One day I say today we live as a lion!

[Pre-Verse]
Blood! Soaked! Earth! That you call home!

[Verse 2]
Heard this cat got life in the pen
Crossin' sand in the back of a truck bed
Twelve deep heard sirens and lights red
Smacked on his dome with the club of a white Fed
No food, no water, no rights read
Came north to his seeds, and his wife fed
In the middle of the darkest night bled
Stepped to the law, said
You a minuteman? Wait a minute man
Talk like that might limit your life span

[Chorus]
After dark my city's a fuse
One day I say today we live as a lion!

[Chorus]
After dark my city's a fuse
After dark my city's a fuse
One day I say today we live as a lion!

[Bridge x6]
And when our cubs grow
We'll show you what war is good for!
