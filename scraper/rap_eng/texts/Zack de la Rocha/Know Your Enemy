[Intro]
Huh
Yeah, we're comin' back in with another bomb track
Think ya know it's all of that, huh
Ayyo, so check this out, yeah

[Chorus]
Know your enemy
C'mon

[Verse 1]
Born with insight and a raised fist
A witness to the slit wrist
As we, move into '92
Still in a room without a view
Ya got to know, ya got to know
That when I say go, go, go
Amp up and amplify, defy
I'm a brother with a furious mind
Action must be taken
We don't need the key, we'll break in
Something must be done
About vengeance, a badge and a gun
'Cause I'll rip the mic, rip the stage, rip the system
I was born to rage against 'em
Fist in ya face in the place and I'll drop the style clearly

[Chorus]
Know your enemy
Know your enemy
Yeah
Ayyo, get with this, ugh

[Verse 2]
Word is born
Fight the war, fuck the norm
Now I got no patience
So sick of complacence
With the D, the E, the F, the I, the A, the N, the C, the E
Mind of a revolutionary, so clear the lane
The finger to the land of the chains
What? The "land of the free?"
Whoever told you that is your enemy
Now something must be done
About vengeance, a badge and a gun
'Cause I'll rip the mic, rip the stage, rip the system
I was born to Rage Against 'em
Now action must be taken
We don't need the key, we'll break in

[Bridge: Maynard James Keenan]
I've got no patience now
So sick of complacence now
I've got no patience now
So sick of complacence now
Sick of, sick of, sick of, sick of you
Time has come to pay

[Chorus]
Know your enemy

[Guitar Solo]

[Outro]
C'mon
Yes, I know my enemies!
They're the teachers who taught me to fight me
Compromise, conformity, assimilation, submission
Ignorance, hypocrisy, brutality, the elite
All of which are American dreams
All of which are American dreams
All of which are American dreams
All of which are American dreams
All of which are American dreams
All of which are American dreams
All of which are American dreams
All of which are American dreams
