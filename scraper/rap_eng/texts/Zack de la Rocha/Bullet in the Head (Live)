[Zach de la Rocha]
This song is called A Bullet in Your Head
So get with this

[Verse 1]
This time the bullet cold rocked ya
A yellow ribbon instead of a swastika
Nothin' proper about ya propaganda
Fools follow rules when the set commands ya

They said it was blue when ya blood was red, yeah
That's how ya got a bullet blasted through your head
Blasted through your head, blasted through your head
I give a shout out to the living dead

Who stood and watched as the feds cold centralized
So serene on the screen you was mesmerized
Cellular phones soundin' a death tone
Corporations cold turn you to stone before you realize

[Pre-Chorus]
They load the clip in omnicolor
Said they pack the 9, they fire it at prime time
The sleeping gas, every home was like Alcatraz
And motherfuckers lost their minds

[Chorus]
Just victims of the in-house drive-by
They say jump, you say "How high?"
Yeah!
Just victims of the in-house drive-by
They say jump, you say "How high?"
Check-a, check-a, check this shit out

[Guitar solo by Tom Morello]

[Chorus]
Just victims of the in-house drive-by
They say jump, you say "How high?"
Yeah!
Just victims of the in-house drive-by
They say jump, you say "How high?"
Check-a, check-a, check it out

[Pre-Chorus]
They load the clip in omnicolor
They pack the 9, they fire it at the prime time
The sleeping gas, every home was like Alcatraz
And muthafuckers lost their minds

[Verse 3]
No escape from the mass mind rape
Play it again jack and then rewind the tape
And then play it again and again and again
Until your mind is locked in

Believin' all the lies that they're tellin' ya
Buyin' all the products that they're sellin' ya
They say jump and you say how high
You brain dead? You gotta fuckin' bullet in your head?

[Chorus]
Just victims of the in-house drive-by
They say jump, you say "How high?"
Yeah
Just victims of the in-house drive-by
They say jump, you say "How high?"

[Bridge]
Uh
Yeah
Shit
What?

Your standin' in line
Believin' the lies
Your bowin' down to the flag
You got a bullet in your head

Am I standing in line?
Am I believin' the lies?
I'm bowin' down to the flag
I got a bullet in the head

A bullet in your head
A bullet in your head
A bullet in your head
A bullet in your head
A bullet in your head
A bullet in your head
A bullet in your head
A bullet in your head

A bullet in your head
A bullet in your head
A bullet in your head
A bullet in your head
A bullet in your head
A bullet in your head
A bullet in your head
You gotta bullet in your fuckin' head

Yeah
Yeah
