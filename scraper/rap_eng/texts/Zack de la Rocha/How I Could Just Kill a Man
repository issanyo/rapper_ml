[Verse 1]
Hey, don't miss out on what you're passing
You're missing the hootah of the funky Buddha
Eluder of the fucked up style's that get wicked
So come on as I start to kick it
Cause we're like outlaws stridding
Suckers are hiding
Jump behind the bush
When they see me driving by
Hanging out my window
And my magnum taking out some putos
Acting kinda loco
I'm just another local kid
From the street getting paid for my vocals
Here is something you can't understand
How I could just kill a man!

[Chorus 1]
Here is something you can't understand
How I could just kill a man!
Here is something you can't understand
How I could just kill a man!
Here is something you can't understand
How I could just kill a man!
Here is something you can't understand…

[Verse 2]
I've been doin' all the dumb shit, yo, because nothin' is coming from it
I'm not gonna waste no time fucking around, I got ya humming
Hummin', comin' at ya!
Then you know I had to gat ya!
Time for some action, just a fraction of friction (uh!)
I got the clearance to run the interference
Into your satellite, shining a battle light
Swing out the gat, and I know that we'll gat you right!
Here's an example, just a little sample…
How I could just kill a man!
One-time tried to come in my home
Take my chrome, I said, "Yo it's on!
Take cover son, or you're assed out!
How do you like my chrome?" Then I watched the rookie pass out
Didn't have to blast him but, I did any way
Ha ha ha ha ha! Young punk had to pay
So I just killed the man!

[Chorus 1]
Here is something you can't understand
How I could just kill a man!
Here is something you can't understand
How I could just kill a man!
Here is something you can't understand
How I could just kill a man!
Here is something you can't understand…

[Bridge]
It's gonna be a long time before I finish
One of the many missions that I have to establish
To light my spliff, ignite you with these site
So if you ain't down…
Bullshit!

[Verse 3]
Say some punk tried to get you for your auto…
Would call the one time and play the role model?
No! I think you'll play like a thug
Next hear the shot of a magnum slug
Humming, coming at ya!
Yeah, you know I'm gonna to gat ya!
How do you know where I'm at
When you haven't been where I've been?
Understand where I'm coming from!
While you're up on the hill in your big home
I'm out here risking my dome, just for a bucket, or a fast ducat
Just to stay alive, yo, I gotta say, "Fuck it!"

[Refrain]
Here is something you can't understand…
How I could just kill a man!
Here is something you can't understand…
How I could just kill a man!
Here is something you can't understand…
How I could just kill a man!
Here is something you can't understand…
How I could just kill a man!

[Chorus 2]
Here is something you can't understand
How I could just kill a man!
Here is something you can't understand
How I could just kill a man!
Here is something you can't understand
How I could just kill a man!
Here is something you can't understand
How I could just kill a man!
Here is something you can't understand
How I could just kill a man!
Here is something you can't understand
How I could just kill a man!
Here is something you can't understand
How I could just kill a man!
Here is something you can't understand
How I could just kill a man!

[Outro]
How I could just kill a man!
How I could just kill a man!
