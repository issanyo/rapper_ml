Greed!
Causing innocent blood to flow
Entire culture, lost in the overthrow
They came to seize and take whatever they please
Then all they gave back was death and disease
My people were left with no choice but to decide
To conform to a system, responsible for genocide
Responsible for genocide
Responsible for genocide

AIDS is killing the entire African nation
And a vaccine is still supposedly under preparation
But these governments, they don't mind their procrastination
They say, "We'll kill them off, take their land and go there for vacation."

My people's culture was strong
It was pure and if not for that white greed
It would've endured
My people were left with no choice but to decide
To conform to a system
Their minds enslaved, their souls encaged
I feel the rage
It's brutality can never be undone
But the sun is not yet set
The bass and drums and microphones a threat
That's when ya investigate the crimes from the inside
And see that they're responsible for genocide
Responsible for genocide
Responsible for genocide

Ya cram ya culture down my throat
Say I'm inferior when I find it I choke
Ya fill my mind with a false sense of history
And then you wonder why I have no identity?
Well I'll strike a match and it'll catch and
Spread the insight we need
A tiny fire, burning bright
Shedding light on the darkness of greed

A yes yes y'all
And ya don't stop
Shedding light on the darkness of greed

A yes yes y'all
And ya don't stop
Shedding light on the darkness of greed

Yeah!
