[Zack de la Rocha]
The main attraction, distraction
Got ya number than number than numb
Empty ya pockets son, they got you thinkin' that
What ya need is what they selling
Make you think that buying is rebelling
From the theaters to malls on every shore
Tha thin line between entertainment and war
The frontline is everywhere, there be No Shelter here!
Spielberg, the nightmare works so push it far
Amistad was a whip, the truth was feathered and tarred
Memory erased, burned and scarred...
Trade in ya history for a VCR
Cinema, simulated life, ill drama
Fourth Reich culture, Americana
Chained to the dream they got ya searchin' for
Tha thin line between entertainment and war

Hook:
There be No Shelter here!! (Tha frontline is everywhere...)
There be No Shelter here!! (Tha frontline is everywhere...)
There be No Shelter here!! (Tha frontline is everywhere...)
There be No Shelter here!! (Tha frontline is everywhere...)

Hospitals not profit full
Yet market bulls got pockets full
To advertise some hip disguise
View tha world from American eyes
Tha poor adore keep fiendin' for more
Tha thin line between entertainment and war
They fix the need, develop the taste
Buy their products or get laid to waste
Coca-Cola is back in the veins of Saigon
And Rambo too, he got a dope pair of Nikes on
And Godzilla, pure muthafuckin FILLER
To keep ya eyes off the real killer...
Cinema, simulated life, ill drama
Fourth Reich culture, Americana
Chained to the dream they got ya searchin' for
Tha thin line between entertainment and war

[Hook]
There be No Shelter here!! (Tha frontline is everywhere...)
There be No Shelter here!! (Tha frontline is everywhere...)
There be No Shelter here!! (Tha frontline is everywhere...)
There be No Shelter here!! (Tha frontline is everywhere...)

American eyes, American eyes....
View the world from American eyes...
Bury the past, rob us blind...
And leave nothing behind...

American eyes, American eyes....
View the world from American eyes...
Bury the past, rob us blind...
And leave nothing behind...

[Guitar riff]

Just stare!
Just stare!
Just stare!
Just stare!
Relive the nightmare!
