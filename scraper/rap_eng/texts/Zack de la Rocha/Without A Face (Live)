It seems as if soon as the... the wall in Germany fell, that the US government was busy building another one at the border between the US and Mexico. Since 1986, as a result of a lot of the hate talk and hysteria that the government of the United States has been speaking, 1,500 bodies have been found at the border. We wrote this song in response to it. It's called "Without A Face."

Uh..
I got no card, so I got not soul
Life is prison, no parole, no control
Jura got my number on a wire tap
'Cause I jack for Similac, fuck a Cadillac
Survive, one motive no hope
'Cause every sidewalk I walk is like a tightrope
Yes, I know my deadline, sire, when my life expires
I'm sendin' paper south under the barbed wire
The mother of my child will lose her mind at my grave
It's my life for their life, so call it a free trade
"Por vida" and our name up on the stall
I took a death trip, when I tried to cross the white wall

[Hook]
Walk unseen past the graves and the gates
Born without a face
Born without a face
Walk unseen past the graves an the gates
Born without a face
One motive no hope, uh, yeah
Born without a face
Without a face!

I tried to look back to my past long lost
A blood donor to the land owner holocaust
Pop's heart stopped, in came the air drop
Flooded the trench, he couldn't shake the toxic shock
Maize, was all we needed to sustain
Golden skin burns, insecticide rain
Ya down with DDT, yeah, you know me
I'm raped for the grapes, profit for the bourgeoisie
War tape boomin', path is Luminoso
I'm headed north like my name was Kid Cisco
To survive, one motive no hope, uh
It's hard to breathe with Wilson's hand around my throat, uh
Strangled and mangled, another SS curtain call
When I tried to cross the white wall
When I tried to cross the white wall

[Hook]
Walk unseen past the graves and the gates
Born without a face!
One motive no hope, uh
Without a face!
Walk unseen past the graves and the gates
Born without a face!
One motive no hope, uh
Without a face!
