(Every official that comes in, cripples us leaves us maimed..
Silent and tamed...and with our flesh and bones, he builds his homes)

[Verse 1]
Southern fist, rise through the jungle mist
Clenched to smash power so cancerous
A black flag and a red star
A rising sun, loomin' over Los Angeles
Cause for Raza livin' in La La
Is like Gaza on to the dawn of Intifada
Reach for the lessons the masked pass on
And seize the metropolis, it's you that it's built on

[Pre-Chorus]
Everything can change on a new years day..
Everything can change on a new years day..
Everything can change on a new years day..
And everything changed on a new years day...C'mon!

[Hook]
War within a breath!
It's land or death!
War within a breath!
It's land or death!
War within a breath!
It's land or death!
War within a breath!
It's land...

(Their existence is a crime
Their seat, their robe, their tie
Their land deeds, their hired guns
They're the crime)

[Verse 2]
Shots heard underground round the rapture
The world's eye captured at last in a Mexican pasture
The masked screaming land or death
Within a breath, a war from the depth of time
Who shot four puppet governors in a line
Who shook all the world bankers who think they can rhyme
Shot the landlords who knew it was mine
Yes, it's a war from the depth of time

[Pre-Chorus]

Ugh, Hear the masked scream..

[Hook]

It's land or death..

[Hook]
War within a breath!
It's land or death!
War within a breath!
It's land or death!
War within a breath!
It's land or death!
War within a breath!
It's land
Or death!
