[Verse]
The sisters are in so check the front line
Seems I spent the '80s in the Haiti state of mind
Cast me into classes for electroshock
Straight incarcerated, the curriculum's a cell block
I'm swimming in half truths and it makes me wanna spit
Instructor come separate the healthy from the sick
Ya weigh me on a scale, smelling burnt skin
It's dark now in Dachau and I'm screaming from within
Cause I'm cell locked in the doctrines of the right
Enslaved by dogma, talk about my birthrights
Yet at every turn I'm running into hell's gates
So I grip the cannon like Fanon an pass the shells to my classmates
Aw, power to the people
Cause the boss's right to live is mine ta die
So I'm going out heavy sorta like Mount Tai
Wit the five centuries of penitentiary so let the guilty hang
In the year of the boomerang

[Chorus] x4
I got no property but yo I'm a piece of it
So let the guilty hang

[Bridge]
Yeah
Now its upon you
Now its upon you

[Verse]
The sistas are in so check the front line
Seems I spent the '80s in the Haiti state of mind
Cast me into classes for electro shock
Straight incarcerated, the curriculum's a cell block
I'm swimmin' in half truths and it makes me wanna spit
Instructor come separate the healthy from tha sick
Ya weigh me on a scale, smellin' burnt skin
It's dark now in Dachau and I'm screamin' from within
Cause I'm cell locked in tha doctrines of tha right
Enslaved by dogma, talk about my birthrights
Yet at every turn I'm runnin' into hell's gates
So I grip tha cannon like Fanon an pass tha shells to my classmates
Aw, power to tha people
Cause tha bosses right ta live is mine ta die
So I'm goin' out heavy sorta like Mount Tai
Wit tha five centuries of penitentiary so let tha guilty hang
In tha year of tha boomerang

[Chorus] x4
I got no property but yo I'm a piece of it
So let tha guilty hang

[Outro]
Yeah
Now its upon you
Now its upon you
You (x8)
Yeah
