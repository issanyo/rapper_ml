[Verse 1]
A mass of hands press on the market window
Ghosts of progress dressed in slow death
Feeding on hunger and glaring through the promise
Upon the food that rots slowly in the aisle
A mass of nameless, at the oasis
That hides the graves beneath the master's hill
Are buried for drinking, the rivers water while
Shackled to the the line at the empty well

[Hook]
This is the new sound, just like the old sound
Just like the noose wound, over the new ground
This is the new sound, just like the old sound
Just like the noose wound, over new ground

[Verse 2]
Listen to the fascist sing
"Take hope here, war is elsewhere
You were chosen, this is God's land
Soon we'll be free of blot and mixture
Seeds planted by our Forefathers' hand"

[Verse 3]
A mass of promises begin to rupture
Like the pockets Of the new world kings
Like swollen stomachs In Appalachia
Like the priest that fucked you as he whispered holy things
A mass of tears have, transform the stones now
Sharpened on suffering and woven into the slings
Hope lies in the rubble of this rich fortress
Taking today what tomorrow never brings

[Hook]

[*whispers*]
This is the new sound...just like the old sound..
Just like the noose wound...over the new ground..
Ain't the new sound...just like the old sound..
Look at the noose now...over the, over the, over the burning ground!

Ain't it funny how the factory doors close?
'Round the time the school doors close?
'Round the time that the doors of the jail cells
Open up to greet you
Just like a reaper?
Ain't it funny how the factory doors close?
'Round the time the school doors close?
'Round the time that a hundred thousand jail bells
Open up to greet you
Just like the reaper?

Ah, Oh!
Ah, Oh!
Oasis!
This is no oasis!

[Hook]

[*whispers*] [x10]
Like ashes in the fall..
[Repeat x8]
Like ashes in the fall... (HA! HAA!!)
Like ashes in the fall... (HO! HOO!!)

[Continues as fades]
