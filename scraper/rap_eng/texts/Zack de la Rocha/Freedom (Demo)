Uggh!
Pull, pull
Yeah

Solo, I'm a soloist on a solo list
All live, never on a floppy disk
Inka, inka, bottle of ink
Paintings of rebellion
Drawn up by the thoughts I think

Come on

Brotha, did ya forget ya name?
Did ya lose it on the wall
Playin' tic-tac-toe?
Yo, check the diagonal
Three brothers gone
Come on
Doesn't that make it three in a row?

Anger is a gift
Hey
Yes, aw yeah
Ugh!

Check that!
Ugh!
Come on
Yeah
Ugh
Drop it

Brotha, did ya forget ya name?
Did ya lose it on the wall
Playin' tic-tac-toe?
Yo, check the diagonal
Three brothers gone
Come on
Doesn't it make three in a row
Environment
The environment exceeding on the level
Of our unconsciousness
For example
What does the billboard say
Come and play, come and play
Forget about the movement

Anger is a gift
Ugh!
Hey
Bring that shit in
Ugh!
Hey!

Freedom, yeah
Freedom yeah right
Freedom yeah!

Freedom!
Yeah!
Freedom!
Yeah right!
Freedom!
Yeah!
Freedom!
Yeah!
Right!
