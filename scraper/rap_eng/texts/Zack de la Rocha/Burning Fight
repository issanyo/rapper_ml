I'll reach out my hand
And you'll turn the other way
I'm only trying to extend myself
To communicate
I try and I try and I try
There's no response from you
So now I refuse to waste my, waste my time
To waste my fucking time on you

I refuse to let myself down
By falsely putting judgement on you
To make myself look higher, higher
Only to be knocked down by the truth

I will never choose a different path
I will never turn away from you

Your attitude is an example of this
Which has become for me a burning fight
Not to change your opinion of me
But to try to help you see what's right

And I will never choose a different path
Ya I will never turn away from you
I will never choose a different path
And I will never fucking be like you!

Ya, it's my burning fight
My burning fight
This is my burning fight
My burning fight
