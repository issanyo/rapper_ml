[Zack de la Rocha]
Turn on the radio - Nah, FUCK IT!! Turn it off!
Fear is your only god on the radio - Nah, FUCK IT!! Turn it off!
Turn it off, turn on the radio - Nah, FUCK IT!! Turn it off!
Fear is your only god on the radio - Nah, FUCK IT!!
Your savior's my guillotine, crosses and kerosene..

[Verse One]
Merge on the networks, slangin nerve gas
Up jump the boogie then BANG!!, let 'em hang
While the paranoid, try ta stuff the void
Let's capture this AM mayhem
Undressed, and BLESSED by the Lord
The power pendulum swings by the umbilical cord
Shock around the clock, from noon 'til noon
Men grabbin they mics, and stuff 'em into the womb
Terror's the product ya push
Well, I'm a truth addict - aw shit, I got a headrush!!
Sheep tremble and here come the votes
Thrown from the throat, cages and scapegoats
Undressed and blessed by the Lord
The same devil, that ran around Managua wit a sword
Check out the new style that Ollie found
I tune in wit a bullet, ta SHUT DOWN the devil sound!!

SHUT DOWN the devil sound!!
The program of Vietnow
SHUT DOWN the devil sound!!

Turn on the radio - Nah, FUCK IT!! Turn it off!
Fear is your only god on the radio - Nah, FUCK IT!! Turn it off!
Turn it off, turn on the radio - Nah, FUCK IT!! Turn it off!
Fear is your only god on the radio - Nah, FUCK IT!!
Your savior's my guillotine, crosses and kerosene..

Flex the cerebellum -- FIRE, uh!!
Somebody gotta shell 'em, these evil angels lists
Hittin the AM playlist, paid ta say this
That one inhuman, illegal, single, woman
The one wit'out a movement..
The transmissions WHIPPIN our backs
Yeaaah! Comi' down like bats from Stacey Koon and
Terror's tha product ya push
Well, I'm a truth addict - aw shit, I got a headrush!!
The sheep tremble and here come the votes
Thrown from the throat, cages and scapegoats
One caution, the mic's a detonator unwound (UN-WOUND)
Ta SHUT DOWN the devil sound!!

SHUT DOWN the devil sound!!
Check the heads BOW in Vietnow!!
SHUT DOWN the devil sound!!

Is all the world jails and churches?
...
Is all the world jails and churches?
...
Is all the world jails and churches?
...
Is all the world jails and churches?
...
Is all the world jails and churches?
