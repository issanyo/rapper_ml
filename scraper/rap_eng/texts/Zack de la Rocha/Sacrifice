[Verse 1]
I gave, I gave
You indulged yourself and robbed from my good will
If not you who can I trust? Who can I trust to be fulfilled?
Sacrifice, I've done more than my share
I kept you from drowning when I couldn't swim
Now I'm sinking and you're not there

[Chorus]
You're not there
You're not there
You're not there

[Verse 2]
So now I choke on every word that I said to your pretty face
Like when I said that no one better
No one better could take your place
Betrayal, lies, lies thick in the air
And should the bottom fall out on your life
You'll turn around and I'm not there

[Chorus 2]
I'm not there
I'm not there
I'm not there

[Bridge]
Don't waste your time insulting me, I'd do anything
You take and you take then you just give it away
So how can I give any more?
There will be no more, there will be no more sacrifice
