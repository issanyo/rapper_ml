[Zack De la Rocha]
Rebel, rebel, and yell
Cause our people still dwell in hell
Locked in a cell, yes the structure's a cell
Mad is the story I tell
How long can we wait?
C'mon, seein' what's at stake
Action for reaction
If your mind's in a somewhat complacent state, get a check up
This is a stick up
Our freedom, or your life
Lord, I wish I could be peacful
But there can be no sequel
Now freedom must be fundamental
In Johannesburg, or South Central
On the mic, cause someone should tell 'em
To kick in the township rebellion

Yeah, what about that sucka

Yeah, so you thought you could get with the hardlines, that fill your mind
Thoughts, battles fought, and lessons taught
Yes I'll display the fitness, and flip like a gymnast
Raise my fist and resist!
Asleep though we stand in the midst, of the war
Gotta get mine, gotta get more
Keepin' the mic warm against the norm
Cause what does it offer me?
I think often it's nothin but a coffin
Gotta get wreck 'til our necks never swing on a rope
From here, to the cape of no hope
Now freedom must be fundamental
In Johannesburg, or South Central
On the mic, cause someone should tell 'em
To kick in the township rebellion

[Hook]
Why stand on a silent platform?
Fight the war, fuck the norm
Why stand on a silent platform?
Fight the war, fuck the norm
Why stand on a silent platform?
Fight the war, fuck the norm
Why stand on a silent platform?
Fight the war, fuck the norm

[Guitar solo]

[Hook]
Why stand on a silent platform?
Fight the war, fuck the norm
Why stand on a silent platform?
Fight the war, fuck the norm
Why stand on a silent platform?
Fight the war, fuck the norm
Why stand on a silent platform?
Fight the war, fuck the norm

What's it gonna take?

[Instrumental break]

Shackle their minds when they're bent on the cross
When ignorance reigns, life is lost
Shackle their minds when they're left on the cross
When ignorance reigns, life is lost
Shackled our minds when we're bent on the cross
When ignorance reigns, life is lost
Shackled our minds when we're left on the cross
When ignorance reigns, life is lost
Lost
Lost
Shackle your minds and you're left on the cross
When ignorance reigns, life is lost
Just shackle your minds when you're bent on the cross
When ignorance reigns, life is lost
Lost

[Hook]
Why stand on a silent platform?
Fight the war, fuck the norm
Why stand on a silent platform?
Fight the war, fuck the norm
Why stand on a silent platform?
Fight the war, fuck the norm
Why stand on a silent platform?
Fight the war, fuck the norm
