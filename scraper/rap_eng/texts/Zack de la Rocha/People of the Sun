[Zack de la Rocha]

Yeah, people come up
Yeah.. We better turn the bass up on this one

[Verse One]
Check it, since fifteen hundred and sixteen, minds attacked and overseen
Now crawl amidst the ruins of this empty dream
With their borders and boots, on top of us
Pullin' knobs on the floor, of their toxic metropolis
But how you gonna get what you need to get?
The gut eaters, blood drenched get offensive like Tet
The fifth sun sets get back reclaim
The spirit of Cuauht√©moc, alive and untamed
Now face the funk now blastin' out your speaker
On the one - Maya, Mexica
That vulture came to try and steal your name but now you got a gun
Yeah, this is for the people of the sun!

[Hook]
It's comin back around again! - This is for the people of the sun!
It's comin back around again! Uh
It's comin back around again! - This is for the people of the sun!
It's comin back around again! Uh

[Verse Two]
Yeah, never forget that the whip snapped ya back
Your spine cracked for tobacc-oh, I'm the Marlboro Man, uh
Our past blastin' on through the verses
Brigades of taxi cabs rollin' Broadway like hearses
Troops strippin' zoots, shots of red mist
Sailors blood on the deck, come sister resist
From the era of terror, check this photo lens
Now the City of Angels does the ethnic cleanse, uh
Heads bobbin' to the funk out your speaker
On the one - Maya, Mexica
That vulture came to try and steal your name but now you found a gun
You're history! This is for the people of the sun

[Hook]
It's comin back around again! - This is for the people of the sun!
It's comin back around again! Yeah
It's comin back around again! - This is for the people of the sun!
It's comin back around again!

It's comin back around again! - This is for the people of the sun!!
It's comin back around again!
It's comin back around again! - This is for the people of the sun!!
It's comin back around!! - ...of the sun
