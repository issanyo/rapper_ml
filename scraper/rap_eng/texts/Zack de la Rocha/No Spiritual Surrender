[Verse]
Try to make me bow down to you
Try to take my identity
Try to make me just another pebble on the beach
A green mind twists the plan
A cold hand trying to silence me
You try to grasp me, but I'm out of reach

[Chorus]
No spiritual surrender
No spiritual surrender

[Verse]
Try to make me bow down to you
Try to take my identity
Try to make me just another pebble on the beach
A green mind twists the plan
A cold hand trying to silence me
You try to grasp me, but I'm out of reach

[Chorus]
No spiritual surrender
No spiritual surrender
