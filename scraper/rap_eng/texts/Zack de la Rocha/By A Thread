Holding on, for my life
Hanging on, by a thread

'Cause I if I don't try, I'm gonna fall into the hatred of this world
And If I don't try I'm gonna fall, I'm gonna fall

My hands are bleeding, this thread cuts through my veins
But it's all I've got to hold
I hang and pray and struggle everyday
To keep this spark of reality from growing cold

And If I don't try I'm gonna fall, I'm gonna fall

A tightrope balance, my very life
Hangs by a thread above the abyss of my despair
If I lose my grip again, oh if I snap
I will be lost again, a dark relapse
