[Verse 1]
Satellites and, pair of mirrors and
And a man without a home
With a horse and a rider
And a clever, cunning killer
Silent in error and, vocal in spotlights
Lying always, sucking on a bottle of
That sweet, indulgent fluid
Oh greed, oh yes, oh greed, oh yes

[Chorus]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
(Twenty-six years in this stage...)
(You're...twenty-six years in this stage)

Your friendship is a fog
That disappears when the wind redirects
You
Yes, you

[Verse 2]
Father's expectations
Soul soaked in, spit and urine
And you gotta make it where?
To a, sanctuary that's a fragile American hell
An empty dream
A selfish, horrific vision
Passed on like the deadliest of viruses
Crushing you and your naive profession

[Bridge]
Have no illusions, boy
Vomit, all ideals and serve
Sleep and, wake and, serve and
Don't just think just wake and serve and

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Yeah, your friendship is a fog
That disappears when the wind redirects
You
Interested in you
Interested in you
Interested in you
Interested in you
Interested in you
Interested in you
Interested in you
Interested in you
Interested in you (Interested in you)
Interested in you (Interested in you)
Interested in you (Interested in you)
Interested in you (Interested in you)
Interested in you (Interested in you)
Interested in you (Interested in you)
Interested in you (Interested in you)
(Interested in you) Interested in you
(Interested in you) Interested in you
(Interested in you)
Interested in you
(Interested in you)
(Interested in you)
(Interested in you)
(Interested in you)
(Interested in you)
