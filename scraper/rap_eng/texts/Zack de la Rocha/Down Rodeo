[Intro: Zack de la Rocha]
Yeah I'm rollin' down Rodeo with a shotgun
These people ain't seen a, brown-skinned man
Since their grandparents bought one
So, now I'm rollin' down Rodeo with a shotgun
These people ain't seen a, brown-skinned man
Since their grandparents bought one
So now I'm rollin' down Rodeo with a shotgun!

[Verse 1: Zack de la Rocha]
Bangin' this bolo tight, on this solo flight, can't fight alone
Funk the track, my verbs sly like the Family Stone
Them pen devils set the stage for the war at home
Locked without a wage, you're standing in the drop zone
The clockers born, starin' at an empty plate
Mama's torn hands, cover her sunken face
We hungry but them belly full
The structure is set, ya never change it with a ballot pull
In the ruins there's a network for the toxic rock
Schoolyard to precinct, suburb to project block
Bosses rode south for new flesh and a factory floor
The remains left chained to the powder war

[Hook: Zack de la Rocha]
Can't waste a day, when the night brings a hearse!
So make a move and plead the fifth cause ya can't plead the first!
Can't waste a day, when the night brings a hearse!
So, now I'm rollin' down Rodeo with a shotgun
These people ain't seen a, brown-skinned man
Since their grandparents bought one!
Yes, I'm rollin' down Rodeo with a shotgun
These people ain't seen a, brown-skinned man
Since their grandparents bought one!
So now I'm rollin' down Rodeo with a shotgun!

[Guitar Solo: Tom Morello]

[Verse 2: Zack de la Rocha]
Yeah
Bare witness to the sickest shot while suckers get romantic
They ain't gonna send us campin' like they did my man Fred Hampton
Still we lampin', still clockin' dirt for our sweat
A ballot's dead, so a bullet's what I get
A thousand years they had the tools, we should be takin' 'em
Fuck the G-ride, I want the machines that are makin' em!
Our target straight with a room full of armed pawns
To off the Kings on the WestSide at dawn

[Hook: Zack de la Rocha]
Can't waste a day, when the night brings a hearse!
Make a move and plead the fifth cause ya can't plead the first!
Can't waste a day, when the night brings a hearse!
So now I'm rollin' down Rodeo with a shotgun
These people ain't seen a, brown-skinned man
Since their grandparents bought one!
Yeah I'm rollin' down Rodeo with a shotgun
These people ain't seen a, brown-skinned man
Since their grandparents bought one!
Yeah I'm rollin' down Rodeo with a shotgun!

[Outro: Zack de la Rocha]
(The rungs torn from the ladder, can't reach the tumor)
(One god, one market, one truth, one consumer)
Just a quiet, peaceful dance!
Just a quiet, peaceful dance!
Yeaaaaaaaaaah!
Just a quiet, peaceful dance!
Just a quiet, peaceful dance!
{whispers}
Just a quiet, peaceful dance
For the things we'll never have
Just a quiet, peaceful dance
For the things we don't have
