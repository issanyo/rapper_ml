[Verse 1]
Lost at a game, so easy to play
I lost my faith, I lost my stride
How can this be, I fought so desperately
Was too afraid to show what I had inside

[Chorus]
But I believe in redemption
And I believe in redemption
And I believe in redemption

[Verse 2]
Children of the street wander so helplessly
Who will pay for their suffering?
We've got the power to set them free
Yet still, we do nothing, nothing

[Chorus]
But I believe in redemption
And I believe in redemption
And I believe in redemption
I believe!

[Bridge]
Sometimes I just don't know, I guess we lost our way to go
Sometimes I just don't know, I guess we lost our way to go
Sometimes I just don't know, I guess we lost our way to go
Sometimes I just don't know, I guess we lost our way to go

Redemption!
