[Verse 1]
My fears hunt me down
Capturing my memories
The frontier of loss
They try to escape across the street where
Jesus stripped bare
And raped the spirit He was supposed to nurture
In the name of my
In the name of my

[Hook]
Born of a broken man, but not a broken man!
Born of a broken man, but not a broken man!
Born of a broken man, but not a broken man!
Born of a broken man, but not a broken man!

[Verse 2]
Like autumn leaves his sense fell from him
An empty glass of himself shattered somewhere within
His thoughts like a hundred moths
Trapped in a lampshade
Somewhere within
Their wings banging and burning
On through endless night
Forever awake he lies shaking and starving
Praying for someone to turn off the light

[Hook]
Born of a broken man, but not a broken man!
Born of a broken man, but not a broken man!
Born of a broken man, but not a broken man!
Born of a broken man, but not a broken man!

[Verse 3]
My fear is hunting me down
Capturing my memories
The frontier of loss
They try to escape across the street where
Jesus stripped bare
And raped the spirit He was supposed to nurture
In the name of my
In the name of my

[Hook]
Born of a broken man, but not a broken man!
Born of a broken man, but not a broken man!
Born of a broken man, but not a broken man!
Born of a broken man, but not a broken man!
