We're gonna kick 'em out

Well I feel pretty good
And I guess that I could get crazy now baby
We all got in tune
When the dressing room got hazy

I know how you want it
When you're hot and tight
The girl can't stand it
When you do it right
When you're up on the stand
Let me kick out the jams
Kick out the jams, we're gonna kick 'em out

And I'm starin' to sweat
You know my shirt's all wet
What a feeling now baby
The sound that abound and resounds and rebounds straight off of the ceilin'
You gotta have it baby
You can't do without
You get that feelin' gotta kick 'em out
Put that mic in my hand
And let me kick out the jams
Kick out the jams, we gotta kick 'em out

Alright, alright, alright, all

Gotta kick it up
You know you can't get enough, Miss McKenzie
Cause it gets in your brain
And it drives you insane a loopy frenzy
We got a guitar and a crash on the drums
We wanna keep on rockin' till the mornin' comes
Let me be who I am
And let me kick out the jams
Yeah, kick out the jams
I done kicked 'em out
