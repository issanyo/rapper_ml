[Verse 1]
Yeah!
The world is my expense..
The cost of my desire..
Jesus blessed me with its future..
And I protect it with fire..
So raise your fists and march around
Just don't take what you need
I'll jail and bury those committed
And smother the rest in greed!
Crawl with me into tomorrow
Or I'll drag you to your grave
I'm deep inside your children
They'll betray you in my name!

[Hook]
Hey! Hey!
Sleep now in the fire!
Hey! Hey!
Sleep now in the fire!

[Verse 2]
The lie is my expense..
The scope with my desire..
The party blessed me with its future..
And I protect it with fire
I am the Niña, the Pinta, the Santa Maria
The noose and the rapist, the fields' overseer
The agents of orange, the priests of Hiroshima
The cost of my desire...Sleep Now In The Fire!

[Hook]
Hey! Hey!
Sleep now in the fire!
Hey! Hey! Hey!
Sleep now in the fire!

[Verse 3]
For it's the end of history..
It's caged and frozen still..
There is no other pill to take..
So swallow the one...that makes you ill
The Niña, the Pinta, the Santa Maria
The noose and the rapist, the fields' overseer
The agents of orange, the priests of Hiroshima
The cost of my desire...Sleep Now In The Fire!
Yeah!
Sleep now in the fire!
Sleep now in the fire!
Sleep now in the fire!
Sleep now in the fire!
