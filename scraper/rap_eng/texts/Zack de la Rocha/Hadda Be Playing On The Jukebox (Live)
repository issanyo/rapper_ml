[Note: cover of Allen Ginsberg's poem of the same name, with lyrical changes]

Lookin' like a bunch of Frat boys at summer camp and shit

Hadda be flashin' like the daily double
Hadda be playin' on TV
Hadda be loud-mouthed on the comedy hour
Hadda be announced over loud speakers
The CIA and the Mafia are in cahoots

It hadda be said in old ladies' language
It hadda be said in American headlines
Kennedy stretched and smiled
And got double-crossed by lowlife goons and agents
Rich bankers with criminal connections
Dope-pushers in CIA working with
Dope-pushers from Cuba working with
Big time syndicate Tampa, Florida

It hadda be said with a big mouth
It hadda be moaned over factory foghorns
It hadda be chattered on car radio news broadcasts
It hadda be screamed in the kitchen
It hadda be yelled in the basement where uncles were fighting
It hadda be howled on the streets by newsboys to bus conductors
Hadda be foghorned into New York harbor
Hadda echo under hard hats
Hadda turn up the volume in the university ballrooms
Hadda be written in library books, footnoted
Hadda be in the headlines of the Times and Le Monde
It hadda be barked over TV
Hadda be heard in side alleys through ballroom doors
It hadda be played on wire services
Hadda be bells ringing
Comedians stopped dead in the middle of a joke in Las Vegas
Hadda be FBI chief J. Edgar Hoover
And Frank Costello syndicate mouthpiece
Meeting in Central Park, New York together weekends
Reported Time magazine
Hadda be the Mafia and the CIA together starting a war on Cuba
Bay of Pigs and poison assassination headlines
Hadda be the dope cops in the Mafia
Sold all that heroin in America
Hadda be the FBI and organized crime working it together in cahoots against the commies

Hadda be ringing on multinational cash registers
World-wide laundry for organized criminal money
Hadda be the CIA and the Mafia and the FBI together
Bigger than Nixon and bigger than war
Hadda be a gorged throat full of murder
Hadda be a mounted ass, a solid mass of rage
Hadda be a red hot head, a scream in the back of the throat
Hadda be in Kissinger's brain
Hadda be in Rockefeller's mouth
Hadda be the central intelligence, the family, offing the agency Mafia
One big set of criminal gangs working together in cahoots
Hitmen, murderers everywhere
Outrage gonna make secret, drunk, brutal, dirty, and rich

On top of a slag heap of prisons
Industrial cancer
Plutonium smog
Garbage cities, grandma's bedsores
Father's resentments
Hadda be the rulers
Wanting law and order
And they got rich on wanting protection for the status quo

Wanted junkies
Wanted Attica
Wanted Kent State
Wanted war in Indochina
Yeah
It hadda be the CIA and the Mafia and the FBI
Multinational capitalists
Strong armed squads
Private detective agencies for the oh so very rich

And their armies, their navies and Air Force bombing planes
Hadda be capitalism
The vortex of this rage
This competition man to man
The horses head in a capitalist's bed
The Cubans' turf in competitions
Hitmen in gang wars across oceans

Bombing Cambodia settled the score
With White House pots and pans
A warning to Mediterranean governments
The secret police have braced for decades
The NKPD and CIA keep each other's secrets
The OGBU and DIA never hit their own
The KGB and the FBI, one mind
Brute force and full of money
One mind, brute force, and full of money
One mind, brute force, and full of money
One mind, brute force, and full of money
One mind, brute force, and full of money
And full of money
And full of money
And full of money

It hadda be rich and they hadda be powerful
They hadda murder in Indonesia five hundred thousand
Hadda murder in Indochina two million
Hadda murder in Czechoslovakia
Hadda murder in Chile
Hadda murder in Russia
And hadda murder in America

That was a poem by Allen Ginsberg called "Hadda Be Playing On The Jukebox." He's a great poet
