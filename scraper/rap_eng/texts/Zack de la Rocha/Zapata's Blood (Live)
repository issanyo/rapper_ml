Zapata's blood
Wasn't spilt in vain
So now the most poor, the most poor
The most poor wage war, wage war
To reclaim their name

Zapata's blood
Wasn't spilt in vain
So now the most poor, the most poor
The most poor wage war, wage war
To reclaim their terrain

Yeah
On January first, 1994
The indigenous farmers of Southern Mexico
Declared war on an unjust
And illegitimate government

Out of the depths of the most wild, the most poor
Came a just arm struggle
For democracy, justice, and liberty
And it won't stop
Until that 65 year old dictatorship
The Partido Revolucionario Institucional
Is buried in the ground
And the people's voice is heard once again

Yeah
So check it out
On January first of 94 they became known as a Zapatista movement
And they have a saying
And I want you all to sing along with me real quick
It goes something like this
It goes:

"Everything for everyone and nothing for ourselves
Everything for everyone and nothing for ourselves
Everything for everyone and nothing for ourselves
Everything for everyone and nothing for ourselves"

Sing that shit

"Everything for everyone and nothing for ourselves
Everything for everyone and nothing for ourselves
Everything for everyone and nothing for ourselves"

Come on!
Yeah!

"Everything for everyone and nothing for ourselves
Everything for everyone and nothing for ourselves
Everything for everyone and nothing for ourselves
Everything for everyone and nothing for ourselves"
