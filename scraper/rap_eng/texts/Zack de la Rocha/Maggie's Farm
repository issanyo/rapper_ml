[Zack de la Rocha]
I ain't gonna work on...Maggie's Farm no more..
No, I ain't gonna work on....Maggie's Farm no more...
Well, I wake up in the morning, fold my hands, and pray for rain
I got a head full of ideas, that are drivin' me insane
It's a shame...The way she makes me..
Scrub the floor..
I ain't gonna work on....nah...
I ain't gonna work on...Maggie's Farm no more!

I ain't gonna work for....Maggie's brother no more..
Nah, I ain't gonna work for...Maggie's brother no more
Well, he hands you a nickel, and he hands you a dime
And he asks you with a grin, if you're havin' a good time
THEN HE FINES YOU...EVERY TIME...YOU SLAM THE DOOR!!
I AIN'T GONNA WORK FOR...NAH..
I AIN'T GONNA WORK FOR...MAGGIE'S BROTHER NO MORE!!

[Guitar riff]

I ain't gonna work for...Maggie's pa no more..
No, I ain't gonna work for...Maggie's pa no more..
Well, he puts his cigar out in your face just for kicks
His...bedroom window, it is made out of bricks
The National Guard....stands around his door..
I ain't gonna work for...nah..
I ain't gonna work for...Maggie's pa no more!!

I ain't gonna work for...Maggie's ma no more..
No, I ain't gonna work for...Maggie's ma no more..
Well, she talks to all the servants about man and God and law..
AND EVERYBODY SAYS... SHE'S THE "BRAINS" BEHIND PA!!
SHE'S SIXTY-EIGHT...BUT SHE SAYS SHE'S TWENTY-FOUR!!
I AIN'T GONNA WORK FOR...NAH..
I ain't gonna work for Maggie's ma no more!!

[Guitar riff]

I ain't gonna work on...Maggie's Farm no more...
No, I ain't gonna work on...Maggie's Farm no more..
Well I try my best...to be just like I am..
But everybody wants you..
TO BE JUST LIKE THEM!!
THEY SING...WHILE THEY SLAVE, AND I JUST GET BORED!!
I AIN'T GONNA WORK ON...NAH..
I ain't gonna work on Maggie's Farm no more!
