Come on!
Ugh!

[Zach de la Rocha]
Come on
Although ya try to discredit, ya still never edit
The needle I'll thread it, radically poetic
Standin' with the fury that they had in '66
And like E-Double "I'm Mad", still knee deep in the system's shit
Hoover, he was a body remover
I'll give you a dose but it'll never come close to the
Rage built up inside of me
Fist in the air in the land of hypocrisy
Movements come and movements go
Leaders speak movements cease when their heads are flown
Cause all these punks got bullets in their heads
Departments of police, (what!) the judges (what!), the feds
Networks at work, keeping people calm
You know they went after King, when he spoke out on Vietnam
He turned the power to the have-nots
And then came the shot

Yeah!
Yeah, back in this!

With poetry my mind I flex
"Flip" like Wilson, vocals never lackin' that finesse
What do I gotta I got to, what do I gotta to do to wake you up?
To shake you up, to break the structure up
Cause blood still flows in the gutter
I'm like taking photos, mad boy kicks open the shutter
Set the groove, then stick and move like I was Cassius
Rep the "Stutter Step" then bomb a left upon the fascists
Yeah, several federal men
Who pulled schemes on the dream and put it to an end
You better beware of retribution with mind war
20/20 visions and murals with metaphors
Networks at work, keepin' people calm
Ya know they murdered X and tried to blame it on Islam
He turned the power to the have-nots
And then came the shot

[Guitar riff]

What was the price on his head?
What was the price on his head?

I think I heard a shot
I think I heard a shot
I think I heard a shot
I think I heard a shot
I think I heard a shot
I think I heard, I think I heard a shot

"Black Nationalism... [...]
[He] may be a brave contender for this position
But should he abandon his supposed 'obedience'
To the 'White liberal doctrine' of non-violence
And embrace Black Nationalism..."

"Through counter-intelligence, it should be possible
To pinpoint potential troublemakers and neutralize them
Through counter-intelligence, it should be possible
To pinpoint potential troublemakers and neutralize them..."

"And neutralize them..."
"And neutralize them..."
"And neutralize them..."
"And neutralize them..."
"And neutralize them..."

Wake up!
Wake up!
Wake up!
Wake up!
Wake up!
Wake up!
Wake up!
Wake up!

How long?
Not long
'Cause what you reap
Is what you sow
