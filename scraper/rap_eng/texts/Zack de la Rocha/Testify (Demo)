Here we go
9-5 is the blood for your sweat
Pay the landlord, he's taking your blood for the rent
Yo
The balance dead so a bullet's what I get
When my Mao-Say-Tung gets offensive like Tet
The whip snapped my back
My spine cracked
For tobacco
I'm the Marlboro man
Can I make London bridges fall
If they do me like Mumia Abu-Jamal
Nobody move
Nobody move
86 Philly pigs drive a whole city block
And I'm campin' like Hampton
Read the word of the innocent
Yet death row is locked
Capitol-i-ism
Check the wrong rhythm
And so they say let Saigons be Saigons
But wait a Ho-Chi-minute

Waste the day cause the night brings a hearse
Make a move and plead the fifth
Ya can't plead the first

Are you ready to testify?
Get ready to testify
Are you ready to testify?
Get ready to testify

The revolutionary aesthetic
Black leather, beret and powder blue
However meanacing this human form on the outside looks
Without revolutionary action
It's ever so translucent

I stand admist grandeous gestures
Postures and platforms of romanticism
Creating more noise than answers
Creating more noise than the sirens
That keep our children crouched in corners

I sit and watch us do the blind man's dance
And I can't stand the smell of false composure
So I take a Ho-Chi minute to meditate
And think
And then tune to the word of Jose Matin

Doing is the best way of saying
Doing is the best way of saying
Doing is the best way of saying
Doing is the best way of saying

9-5 is the blood for your sweat
Pay the landlord, he's taking your blood for the rent Yo
The balance dead so a bullet's what I get
When my Mao-Say-Tung gets effective like tet
The whip snap my back
My spine crack
Front to back
Ohhh what a Marlboro man
Can I make London bridges fall
If they do me like Mumia Abu-Jamal
Nobody move
Nobody move
86 Philly pigs drive a whole city block
And I'm campin' like Hampton
Read the word of the innocent
Yet death row is locked
Capitol-i-ism
Check the wrong rhythm
And so they say let Saigons be Saigons
But wait a Ho-Chi-minute
Waste the day cause the night brings a hearse
Make a move and plead the fifth
Ya can't plead the first

Are you ready to testify?
Get ready to testify
Are you ready to testify?
Get ready to testify
C'mon

Doing is the best way of saying
Doing is the best way of saying
