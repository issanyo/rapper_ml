[Intro]
Uh, check, check

[Verse 1]
The bastard son, I spit non fiction
In exile for awhile now with raw friction
Never be a pawn, the boomerang be upon you
Like Fela with my heart in Venezuela, it's
A world favela so fuck the novela, I'm
Out of the cellar with a blade and some cheddar, for the
Whole new world, order you to bow down
To the now sound of slavery, this era be
Terrible, terror-filled terrified
Why would we ever let a few white Christian fictions
Shape our tomorrow following them
'Cause tomorrow got a gun to it's head

[Chorus]
The time is coming
Rising like the dawn of a red sun
If you fear dying then you're
Then you're already dead!
The time is coming
Rising like the dawn of a red sun
If you fear dying then you're
Then you're already dead!


[Verse 2]
I'm in the spirit of Ali Tour√© as I
Target more heads than a priest on Ash Wednesday
Paid and hanging you pigs on gold ropes, have the
Mic or the heater but you can't hold both, you could
Snatch one, catch the blast of the other
I'm Chicano soprano high off my pitch ammo, I'm a
Put a crack in your diamond pimp cup, so vest up
I'm your cross turned right side up
I'm the press leak, yo that downed your aide
I'm the orange jump suit that's tailor made
I'm the crescent, the sickle, so sharp the blade, I'm the
Flick of the shank that opened your veins, I'm the
I'm the dusk, I'm the frightening calm
I'm a hole in the pipeline, I'm a road side bomb

[Chorus]
The time is coming
Rising like the dawn of a red sun
If you fear dying then you're
Then you're already dead!
The time is coming
Rising like the dawn of a red sun
If you fear dying then you're
Then you're already dead!
The time is coming
Rising like the dawn of a red sun
If you fear dying then you're
Then you're already dead!
The time is coming
Rising like the dawn of a red sun
If you fear dying then you're
Then you're already dead!
