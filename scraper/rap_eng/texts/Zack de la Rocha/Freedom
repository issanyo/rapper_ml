[Zack de la Rocha]
Ugh!
Pump, pump, wah
C'mon!
Ugh!

Solo
I'm a soloist, on a solo list
All live, never on a floppy disk
Inka, inka, bottle of ink
Paintings of rebellion, drawn up by the thoughts I think!

Yeah!
C'mon!
The militant poet in once again, check it

It's set up like a deck of cards
They're sendin us to early graves for all the diamonds
They'll use a pair of clubs to beat the spades
With poetry I paint the pictures that hit
More like the murals that fit
Don't turn away, get in front of it
Brotha, did ya forget cha name?
Did ya lose it on the wall playin Tic-Tac-Toe?
Yo, check the diagonal, three brothers gone
C'mon, doesn't that make it three in a row?

{quietly spoken as music briefly stops}
Anger is a gift

C'mon!
Ugh!

[Guitar solo]

Drop that!
Ugh!
C'mon!
Yeah!
Ugh!

Brotha, did ya forget ya name?
Did ya lose it on the wall playin' Tic-Tac-Toe?
Yo, check the diagonal, three million gone
C'mon, 'cause you know they're counting backwards to zero
Environment, the environment exceeding
On the level of our unconsciousness
For example, what does the billboard say?:
"Come and play, come and play!
Forget about the movement!"

Anger is a gift

Yeah!
Ugh!
Aw, bring that shit in!!
Ugh!
Hey!

Freedom
Yeah
Freedom
Yeah right
Freedom
Yeah!
Freedom!
Yeah!
Freedom!
Yeah right!
Freedom!
Yeah!
Freedom!
Yeah right!
