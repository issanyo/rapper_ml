Yeah
Pump, pump, whew!
Pump, pump, pump, pump, right
Air, check it, uh

Lyrical champion, the lyrical champion (Go!)
Lyrical champion, we say the mindset's a threat (Go!)
Lyrical champion, the lyrical champion (Go!)
Lyrical champion, we say the mindset's a threat, uh

[Hook]
You know!
You know the mindset's a threat

Go! Go!
Check it

In the industry, you see, they keep a yellow tape
Got the microphone because we want to be free
Never oppress, nor to relay your stress
May lack ability, but now you're put to the test (Go!)
I run a set in the cool atmosphere
Don't worry about my dumb kicks or the car that I steer
That material pressure is just a digressor
Be livin' my life, for they have not yet bothered with pressure, uh

[Hook x4]

Drop it!

Ease up!
Bringin' in the new lifestyle in 1991 now
With the raggamuffin style we're bringin' it deep, yo
Now bring it down
Aw, shit

Listen to what I'm sayin'
Materialism I'm slayin'
Chasin' a prediction, know what I mean
It's the system your obeyin'
Throwin' it like a catcher
You say what you think, you dancer
Runnin' the free nation
Money's not free, if you thinkin' you want the answer
GO!

I run a set in the cool atmosphere
Don't worry about my dumb kicks or the car that I steer
That material pressure is just a digressor
Be livin' my life, for they have not yet bothered with pressure, uh

(You know!)
Yes!
(You know!)
In the new sound!
(You know!)
Ease up!
