Some of those that work forces, are the same that burn crosses
Some of those that work forces, are the same that burn crosses
Some of those that work forces, are the same that burn crosses

[Chorus: B-Real & Chuck D]
Those who died are justified, for wearing the badge, they're the chosen whites
You justify those that died, by wearing the badge, they're the chosen whites
Those who died are justified, for wearing the badge, they're the chosen whites
You justify those that died, by wearing the badge, they're the chosen whites

[Verse 2: B-Real & Chuck D]
Some of those that hold office, are the same that burn crosses
Some of those that hold office, are the same that burn crosses
Some of those up in congress, are the same that burn crosses
Some of those up in congress, are the same that burn crosses

[Hook: B-Real & Chuck D]
Ugh!
Killing in the name of...
Killing in the name of...

[Pre-Chorus 2: B-Real & Chuck D]
Now you do what they told ya
Now you do what they told ya
Now you do what they told ya
Now you do what they told ya
And now you do what they told ya
(Now you're under control)
And now you do what they told ya
(Now you're under control)
And now you do what they told ya
