[Verse 1]
Some of those that work forces
Are the same that burn crosses
Some of those that work forces
Are the same that burn crosses

[Pre-Chorus]
But I won't do what you tell me
Now you're under control

[Chorus]
Those who died are justified for
Wearing the badge, they're the chosen whites
You justified those that died by
Wearing the badge, they're the chosen whites
Those who died are justified for
Wearing the badge, they're the chosen whites

Killing in the name

[Verse 2]
Fuck you, I won't do what you tell me
Fuck you, I won't do what you tell me
Fuck you, I won't do what you tell me
Fuck you, I won't do what you tell me

[Pre-Chorus]
But you, you're under control
Now you do what they told

[Chorus]
Those who died are justified for
Wearing the badge, they're the chosen whites
You justified those that died by
Wearing the badge, they're the chosen whites
Those who died are justified for
Wearing the badge, they're the chosen whites

Killing in the name
Motherfucker
