Rebel, rebel and yell
'Cause our people still dwell in hell
Locked in a cell
Yes, the structure's a cell
Mad is the story I tell
How long can we wait?
Come on, seein' what's at stake
Action for reaction
If your mind's in a somewhat complacent state
Get a check up
This is a stick up
Our freedom or your life
Lord, I wish I could be peacful
But there can be no sequel
Now freedom must be fundamental
In Johannesburg or South Central
On the mic, 'cause someone should tell 'em
To kick in the township rebellion

Come on, ugh
Yeah, what about that sucka

Yeah, so you thought you could get with the hard rhymes
That fill your mind
Thoughts, battles fought
And lessons taught
Yes I'll display the fitness
And flip like a gymnast
Cause rhyme after rhyme
And droppin' line after line
Your locked in a test of the mind
Your style is lagging behind, stuck in 89
Yes I'm inclined, I'm wearing a blind
Come to get some in 91
No freedom in the land of the free
If ya see it then tell me
Now freedom must be fundamental
In Johannesburg or South Central
On the mic, 'cause someone should tell 'em
To kick in the township rebellion

Why stand on a silent platform
Fight the war, fuck the norm
Why stand on a silent platform
Fight the war, fuck the norm
Why stand on a silent platform
Fight the war, fuck the norm
Why stand on a silent platform
Fight the war, fuck the norm

Why stand on a silent platform
Fight the war, fuck the norm
Why stand on a silent platform
Fight the war, fuck the norm
Why stand on a silent platform
Fight the war, fuck the norm
Why stand on a silent platform
Fight the war, fuck the norm

Ugh
Come on

When ignorance reigns, life is lost
When ignorance reigns, life is lost
Come on
When ignorance reigns, life is lost

Why stand on a silent platform
Fight the war, fuck the norm
Why stand on a silent platform
Fight the war, fuck the norm
Why stand on a silent platform
Fight the war, fuck the norm
Why stand on a silent platform
Fight the war, fuck the norm
