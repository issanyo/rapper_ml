Hey yo, let me be front, this is real and not a stunt
I'm comin' to the forefront
Shovel for the rebel and clear the lane
Cause this jam is like a tomahawk, chump

Teach ya, I'll never stop droppin' topics
Vocal power, yes I got it
On central but their trying to clamp it down
Flag was waving the wrong way so I shot it, down!

Get down at the same time come up, down!
This is the crime that shut us up
I don't give a fuck because the words and the thoughts still hit
And like I said, it's not a skit

Jump another hit, yeah
Ya know I don't need a drum kit
Make 'em say, "Aw shit"
The rebellion is true and legit

[Hook]
Down!
Get down! And clear the lane
Down!
Get down! And clear the lane
Down!
Get down! And clear the lane
Down!
Get down! Yeah!

The rebel, you'll never disable
Defiance, with the cards up on the table
Pulling cards, keep the governments in check
Yo! I think we need a new deck

Never could trust a phillabusta'
The mic is like a fist and it'll bust ya
With words cold hittin' with the underground
And now you're checkin' out the new sound

Live hit, a live pop
Live rock and ya don't stop
It goes on and on and on
Who's a threat? C'mon, the war is on!

[Hook]

Start droppin', our words are never safe
Fighting myself 'til I'm where I gotta be
A challenge, don't sweat it, now don't you forget it
Check me? What? Wait, you better slow down

Realize I can't confine my rhyme to a beat
I need cash so pinnacle is never ever weak
Places are fluid and diluted and complete
Check me once, calm down, take a seat

Strip the chains the freedom's there but then it's gone!

Uh, clear the lane
Uh, clear the lane
Uh, clear the lane
Uh, clear the lane

Defiance, rippin' up the sound set
Every time I'm grippin' the mic it is a sound threat
Resist against the suckers that bring the bass in
Timmy C, bring that bass in

Uh, clear the lane
Uh, clear the lane
Uh, clear the lane
Uh, clear the lane
