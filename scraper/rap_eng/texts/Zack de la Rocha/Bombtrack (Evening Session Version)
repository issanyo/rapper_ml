[Verse 1]
Yeah, it's just another bombtrack
And suckers be thinkin' that they can fade this
But, I'm gonna drop it at a higher level
Cause I'm inclined to stoop down, hand out some beat-downs
Cold run a train on punk ho's, that think they run the game
But I learned to burn that bridge, and delete
Those who compete, at a level that's obsolete
Instead, I warm my hands upon the flames of the flag
To recall the downfall, and the businesses that burnt us all
See through the news and the views, that twist reality
Enough, I call the bluff, fuck Manifest Destiny
The landlords and power whores, on my people they took turns
Dispute the suits, I ignite, and then watch 'em burn

[Bridge]
With the thoughts from a militant mind
Hardline, hardline after hardline
The landlords and power whores on my people they took turns
Dispute the suits, I ignite and I watch 'em burn

[Chorus x7]
Watch 'em burn

[Verse 2]
Another funky radical bombtrack
Started as a sketch in my notebook
Yeah now dope hooks make punks take another look
My thoughts ya hear and ya begin to fear
That ya card will get pulled if you interfere

[Bridge]
With the thoughts from a militant militant mind
Hardline, hardline after hardline
The landlords and power whores on my people they took turns
Dispute the suits, I ignite, then I watch 'em burn

[Chorus x7]
Watch 'em burn

Yeah watch them burn

[Chorus x7]
Watch 'em burn

[Verse 3]
Yeah I tried to look back to my past long lost
A blood donor to the land owner Holocaust
Pop's heart stopped, in came the air drop
Flooded the trench, couldn't shake the toxic shock
Maize, was all we needed to sustain
Now her golden skin burns, insecticide rain
Ya down wit DDT - yeah, you know me
I'm raped for the grapes, and the profit for the bourgeoisie
War tape boomin, path is Luminoso
I'm headed north like my name was Kid Cisco
To survive, just a prophet lost and learned
I got to break 'em off and watch 'em burn

[Chorus x7]
Watch 'em burn
