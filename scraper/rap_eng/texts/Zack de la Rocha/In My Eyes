[Note: cover of Minor Threat's "In My Eyes" with lyric changes]

You tell me you like the taste
YOU...JUST...NEED...AN..EXCUSE!!
You tell me it calms your nerves
YOU...JUST...THINK...IT...LOOKS...COOL!!
You tell me you want to be different
YOU...JUST...CHANGE...FOR THE SAME!!
You tell me it's only natural
YOU...JUST..NEED...THE...PROOOOFF!!!
DID YOU FUCKING GET IT?!

[Chorus]
IT'S IN MY EYES, IT'S IN MY EYES!!
IT'S IN MY EYES, IT'S IN MY EYES!!
IT'S IN MY EYES, IT'S IN MY EYES!!
IT'S IN MY EYES, IT'S IN MY EYES!!
AND IT DOESN'T...LOOK THAT WAY TO ME
IN...MY...EYES!!
AND IT DOESN'T...LOOK THAT WAY TO ME
IN...MY...EYES!!

You tell me that nothing matters
YOU'RE...JUST...FUCK...ING...SCARED!!
You tell me, that I'm better
YOU...JUST...HATE...YOURSELF!!
You tell me that you like her
YOU...JUST...WISH...YOU...DID!!
You tell me that I make no difference
WELL, AT LEAST...I'M...FUCKING...TRYIIIING!!!
WHAT THE FUCK HAVE YOU DONE?!

[Chorus]
IT'S IN MY EYES, IT'S IN MY EYES!!
IT'S IN MY EYES, IT'S IN MY EYES!!
IT'S IN MY EYES, IT'S IN MY EYES!!
IT'S IN MY EYES, IT'S IN MY EYES!!
AND IT DOESN'T...LOOK THAT WAY TO ME
IN...MY...EYES!!
AND IT DOESN'T...LOOK THAT WAY TO ME
IN...MY...EYES!!
