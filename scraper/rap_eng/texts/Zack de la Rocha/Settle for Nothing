[Verse 1]
A jail cell is freedom from the pain in my home
Hatred passed on passed on and passed on
A world of violent rage but it's one that I can recognize
Having never seen the color of my father's eyes
Yes, I dwell in hell but it's a hell that I can grip
I tried to grip my family but I slipped
To escape from the pain in an existence mundane
I got a nine, a sign, a set, and now I got a name!

[Chorus]
Read my writing on the wall!
No one's here to catch me when I fall!
Death is on my side!
Suicide!

[Verse 1]
A jail cell is freedom from the pain in my home
Hatred passed on passed on and passed on
A world of violent rage but it's one that I can recognize
Having never seen the color of my father's eyes
Yes, I dwell in hell but it's a hell that I can grip
I tried to grip my family but I slipped
To escape from the pain in an existence mundane
I got a nine, a sign, a set, and now I got a name!

[Chorus]
Read my writing on the wall!
No one's here to catch me when I fall!
Caught between my culture and the system
Genocide!
Read my writing on the wall!
No one's here to catch me when I fall!
Caught between my culture and the system
Genocide!

Read my writing on the wall!
No one's here to catch me when I fall!
If ignorance is bliss
Then knock the smile off my face!
Yeah!

[Outro]
If we don't take action now
We settle for nothing later
Settle for nothing now
And we'll settle for nothing later
If we don't take action now
We settle for nothing later
Settle for nothing now
And we'll settle for nothing later
If we don't take action now
We settle for nothing later
Settle for nothing now
And we'll settle for nothing later
If we don't take action now
We settle for nothing later
Settle for nothing now
And we'll settle for nothing later
