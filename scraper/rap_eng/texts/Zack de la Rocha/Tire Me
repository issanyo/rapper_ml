Ya tryin ta tire me, tire me
Why don't you get from in front of me?!
Oh, she's got everyone's eyes (Yeah!!)
In every home there's a sickening distress! (Yeah!!)
Of roll that film she's a precious, a precious one
But we're all gonna.. - NAH, WE'RE ALREADY DEAD!!!

And those colorful words for the, Laos frontiers-man
Who passed away with the truth amidst the eulogies of bliss
Who will know now what I know about you?

In a violent time, in a violent time
In a violent time, in a violent time
In a violent time, in a violent time
In a violent time, in a violent time..
