[Zack de la Rocha]
Talkin' about the American Indian movement... Well in 1977, after a series of long struggles against the BIA.. get that spotlight out of my fuckin' eye man...get that thing off... talkin' to people I can't even see 'em...in 1977, after a long series of struggles... the Oglala Sioux reservation was under attack by the FBI. People who were involved in the movement there... involved in defending their culture... defending their freedom... were bein' taken away, were bein' kidnapped, were bein' murdered and one man, who happened to be one of the leaders of AIM, was thrown in jail. He has sat there for 17 years for crimes he did not commit. His name is Leonard Peltier, and this brother's been in jail and has served his people, and has served true freedom and constitutional rights and is being denied his own, and I think it's a hypocrisy all of us need to expose in this country. So that if we wanna raise our voice, for ourselves in America the same doesn't happen. We've got, we've got some pamphlets in the back, where we're sellin' some shirts.. please pick one up, and please send, please, send, your name or there's an address you can send or what's his name, fuckin' Dixey Crack Clinton, whoever that fuckin' punk is. Let's fill this punk's room full of fuckin' mail, I know it's not the fuckin' most powerful form of fuckin' change but let's get this fuckin' ball rollin' all right. This song is called "Bombtrack."
One time for ya fuckin' mind, Minnesota. Check this shit out

Yeah
It goes a-1, 2, 3

[Verse 1]
Yeah, it's just another bombtrack and suckers be thinkin' that they can fade this
But, I'm gonna drop it at a higher level
'Cause I'm inclined to stoop down, hand out some beat-downs
Cold run a train on punk ho's, that think they run the game
But I learned to burn that bridge, and delete
Those who compete at a level that's obsolete
Instead, I warm my hands upon the flames of the flag
To recall the downfall, and the businesses that burnt us all
See through the news and the views, that twist reality
Enough, I call the bluff, fuck Manifest Destiny
Landlords and power whores, on my people they took turns
Dispute the suits, I ignite, and then watch 'em burn

[Pre-Chorus]
With the thoughts from a militant mind
Hardline, hardline after hardline
Landlords and power whores
On my people they took turns
Dispute the suits, I ignite
And then watch 'em burn

[Chorus]
Burn, burn, yes ya gonna burn
Burn, burn, yes ya gonna burn
Burn, burn, yes ya gonna burn
Burn, burn, yes ya gonna burn
Burn, burn, yes ya gonna burn
Burn, burn, yes ya gonna burn
Burn, burn, yes ya gonna burn
Burn, burn, yes ya gonna burn

[Verse 2]
It goes a
Another funky radical bombtrack
Started as a sketch in my notebook
And now dope hooks make punks take another look
My thoughts ya hear and ya begin to fear
That ya card will get pulled if ya interfere

[Pre-Chorus]
With the thoughts from a militant militant mind
Hardline, hardline after mothafuckin hardline
Landlords and power whores
On my people they took turns
Dispute the suits, I ignite
And then watch 'em burn

[Chorus]
Burn, burn, yes ya gonna burn
Burn, burn, yes ya gonna burn
Burn, burn, yes ya gonna burn
Burn, burn, yes ya gonna burn
Burn, burn, yes ya gonna burn
Burn, burn, yes ya gonna burn
Burn, burn, yes ya gonna burn
Burn, burn, yes ya gonna burn

[Chorus]
Burn, burn, yes ya gonna burn
Burn, burn, yes ya gonna burn
Burn, burn, yes ya gonna burn
Burn, burn, yes ya gonna burn
Burn, burn, yes ya gonna burn
Burn, burn, yes ya gonna burn
Burn, burn, yes ya gonna burn
Burn, burn, yes ya gonna burn
