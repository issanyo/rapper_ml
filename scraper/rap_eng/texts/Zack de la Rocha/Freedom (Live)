Come
Bring it on, bring it on now
Solo, I'm a soloist on a solo list
All live, never on a floppy disk
Inka, inka, bottle of ink
Paintings of rebellion
Drawn up by the thoughts I think
Oh
Come on, oh
You see a set up like a deck of cards
They're sending us to early graves for all the diamonds
They use a pair of clubs to beat the spades
With poetry I paint the pictures that hit
More like the murals that fit
Don't turn away, get in front of it
Brotha, did you forget your name?
Did you lose it on the wall playin' tic-tac-toe?
Yo, check the diagonal, three brothers gone, come on
Doesn't that make it three in a row?
Your anger is a gift
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Drop it
Sista, did you forget your name?
Did you lose it on the wall playin' tic-tac-toe?
Yo, check the diagonal, three million gone, come on
'Cause you know they're counting backwards to zero
Environment, the environment exceeding on the level
Of our unconsciousness
For example what does the billboard say?
Come and play, come and play, forget about the movement
Forget about yourself's
Forget about your culture
And forget about your history and just fly
And just fly
Your anger is a gift
Yeah yeah
Bring that shit in
Freedom for the real
Freedom for the real
Freedom for the real
Freedom for the real
Freedom for the real
Freedom for the real
Freedom, yeah
Freedom, yeah right
Yeah, freedom, yeah
