[Intro:  Zack de la Rocha]
COME WITH IT NOW!
COME WITH IT NOW!

[Verse One]
The microphone explodes, shattering the molds
Either drop the hits like de la O or get the fuck off tha commode
With tha sure shot, sure ta make the bodies drop
Drop an don't copy yo, don't call this a co-op
Terror rains drenchin', quenchin' tha thirst
Of tha power dons - that five sided Fist-a-gon
The rotten sore on tha face of Mother Earth gets bigger
The triggers cold empty your purse

[Hook]
Rally round the family!  With a pocket full of shells
They rally round the family!  With a pocket full of shells
They rally round the family!  With a pocket full of shells
They rally round the family!  With a pocket full of shells

[Verse Two]
Weapons, not food, not homes, not shoes
Not need, just feed the war cannibal animal
I walk tha corner to tha rubble, that used to be a library
Line up to the mind cemetery now!
What we don't know keeps the contracts alive and movin'
They don't gotta burn tha books, they just remove 'em
While arms warehouses fill as quick as the cells
Rally round tha family, pocket full of shells

[Hook]
Rally round the family!  With a pocket full of shells
They rally round the family!  With a pocket full of shells
They rally round the family!  With a pocket full of shells
They rally round the family!  With a pocket full of shells

Bulls on parade! Uh...

[Guitar Solo]

[Outro]
COME WITH IT NOW!
COME WITH IT NOW!
BULLS ON PARADE!
BULLS ON PARADE!
BULLS ON PARADE!
BULLS ON PARADE!
BULLS ON PARADE!
