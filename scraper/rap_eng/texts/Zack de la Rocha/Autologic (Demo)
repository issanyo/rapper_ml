C'mon!

The A-U-T-O-L-O-G-I-C
The A-U-T-O-L-O-G-I-C
Hey
The A-U-T-O-L-O-G-I-C

Drop auto logic
You thought you could get with
Me and Tommy hittin' man
Cold dropped a smash hits
Angry as a veteran
Back in the force
'Cause I'm not frontin'
Comin' upon the stage I'll say ya somethin'

Clear as a project
The style is hectic
Guess I'm left with
A system skeptic
The truths I'm droppin'
From the pulpit I'm yellin'
Inspired by gunshots from a township rebellion
Word is a rough mix
Sign of justice
The rhyme is allowed 'cause you can't fillibust this
Style I'll catch ya
I'll catch ya the rapture
Ya murdered my level head
Ya know that I have to

Drop auto logic
Yo I got to drop the logic
Drop auto logic
Yo I got to drop the logic
Auto logic
Yo I got to drop the logic
Drop auto logic
Yo I got to drop the logic

Stop before you take a wrong turn
Stop before you step up on the stage and get burned
Stop and just listen
I'm dismissing competition with decisions
So I guess you'll have to listen and learn
Creative
So what ya gonna do?
Ain't no fading
So what ya gonna do?
Grab the microphone and say a check one two
The kid's solo
Unafraid of any crew
'Cause I'm the type of brother with the maddest
Status
Statue or poll
Paid in full
No bull never dull
Always in control
Taking no shit like I was Manute Bol

Uh
Aw yeah
It goes a just like that yeah
Now break it down

Auto logic
On auto pilot
Silence equals death
And death equals silence
The crew that doesn't choose to speak their mind
Is a crew that looses power over time
And now that ya finally woke up
Yo wish your motherfuckin' ass would have spoke up
Voices in full
The balled of the bullet
The mic is a trigger and I pull it
Droppin' and smashin'
Thrashin' and bashin' the set
Mentally and spiritually correct
Back and ya know it's a treat
'Cause every time I step ya know I won't forget ta

Drop auto logic
Yo I got to drop the logic
Drop auto logic
Yo I got to drop the logic
Auto logic
Yo I got to drop the logic
Drop auto logic
Yo I got to drop the logic

Auto logic
Yo I got to drop the logic
Drop auto logic
Yo I got to drop the logic
Auto logic
Yo I got to drop the logic
Drop auto logic
Yo I got to drop the logic
Come on
