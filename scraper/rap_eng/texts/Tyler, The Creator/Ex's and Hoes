[Hook]
Ex's and Hoes, Ex's and Hoes
Why they fucking with me? Who Knows
Is it my glo? Or and I for show?
Ex's and Hoes, Ex's and Hoes
[Verse 1]
Wake up and check my phone
Got bitches calling and texting me, but it's only one girl I see in my eyes
Tryna make her mine, she is devine, and oh so fine
Time is everything so I hope she give me some of her for a real nigga
But meanwhile on the other side I got some hoes tryna be the bride
But I already learned my lesson
These hoes ain't gonna ride for you, slide for you, probably lying to you
Then when you decide not to put up for the bullshit they crying to you
But girl I'm a real nigga so I can see it in my eyes you bullshitting
Always checking my IG with DM'S talking about, dopey is mine
In what timeline is that true?
Cause y'all be coming out the blue
When I'm texting in the group chat that's your cue it seems
I can't fuck with you people because y'all only text me on some irrelevant shit
I don't care about the drugs you doing or the nigga that you're with
Oh that's your boo? She still cool with that nigga you don't like
But she acting like a dyke besides you, but you a fool and don't realize it
But that's cool, because I'm chilling and watching the shit fold
[Verse 2]
Now these ex's, they ain't from texas
But they be tryna make you jealous
But bitch, I'm next up, best up, and no I'm never flexed up
So why should I be worrying about who you texting huh?
I don't really give a fuck about who you sexing up
So I'ma sit back in this drink in my cup, but no it ain't lean
And when that nigga leave, you gonna be crying to me
You making pleas, I'm just tryna get you off me like fleas
Because I'm living life carefree, smoke a bit of weed that's all I need
Yes indeed, no Lil Baby
Just need a Mercedes
Yes that sounds crazy, but I just gotta make sure my guys is fed
Bros before hoes, that's the fucking code my nigga, and you better learn it, or else you gotta be slowed by these ex's and hoes my nigga
