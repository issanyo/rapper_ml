TYLER, THE CREATOR and EARL SWEATSHIRT are two members of OFWGKTA. The atmosphere backstage before their Sydney show was beyond hyper - different members of Odd Future would come and go, and everyone was yelling, beating each other up and throwing chairs across the room. It was a little bit intimidating but mostly exciting, and reminded us of those high school drama classes where everyone just wanted to be the centre of attention.
