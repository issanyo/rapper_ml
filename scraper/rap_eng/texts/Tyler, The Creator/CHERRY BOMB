[Intro]
I really made this song just so I could perform it
I don't even know how to perform it

[Verse 1]
Aw, nah, boy don't cut that wood
Found out your flowers don't smell that good
But if they smell real good to him
Then he don't need anybody else's nose to win
Look, I am a God, nobody prays to the sight of you
All y'all niggas wear camouflage
I'm in a field wearing pink and blue
I wear pink, they can see me
Nigga, you don’t create, you just repeat
Nigga you don’t got drive, you just beep beep
Beep beep, talk shit from the backseat

[Pre-Chorus]
Come and light my fire, I'll blow your fuckin' face off
Nigga I'm the got damn pilot
And I decide when we gon' take off (let's get it)

[Chorus]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Tie the knot
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Kick the chair
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Float in the air
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
It's cherry bomb

[Verse 2]
You muthafuckas want war, then come get it
You motherfuckas want war and i want more
Nigga fuck you and everything that you come for
You motherfuckas wanna blow?
Pow, pow-pow, pow-pow
Then let’s take ‘em to the gun store
I don't got enough time, fuck your rolex nigga
Don’t compare him to mine, ‘cause I don’t know that nigga

[Pre-Chorus]
Come and light my fire, I'll blow your fuckin' face off
Nigga I’m the got damn pilot
And I decide when we gon' take off, let's get it

[Chorus]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Tie the knot
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Kick the chair
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Strangled in the air
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
It's cherry bomb

[Bridge]
You muthafuckas want war?!
Fuck that light, this, that Cherry Bomb
Fuck that light, this, that Cherry Bomb
Fuck that light, this, that Cherry Bomb
Fuck that light, this, that Cherry Bomb
Fuck that light, this, that Cherry Bomb
Fuck that light, this, that Cherry Bomb
Fuck that light, this, that Cherry Bomb
Fuck that light, this, that Cherry Bomb
Fuck that light, this, that Cherry Bomb
Fuck that light, this, that Cherry Bomb
Fuck that light, this, that Cherry Bomb
Fuck that light, this, that Cherry Bomb

[Refrain]
Firecracker and I’m ready to blow
Don’t fire me up
I lose control
Firecracker and I’m ready to blow
Don’t fire me up
I lose control
Firecracker and I’m ready to blow
Don’t fire me up
I lose control
Firecracker and I’m ready to blow
Don’t fire me up
I lose control
Firecracker and I’m ready to blow
Don’t fire me up
I lose control
