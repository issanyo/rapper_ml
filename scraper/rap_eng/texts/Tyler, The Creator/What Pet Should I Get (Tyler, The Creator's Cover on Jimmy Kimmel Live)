[Verse 1: Tyler]
You see how it is when you pick a new pet

How can you make up your mind what to get

But what if we took one of each kind of pet then our home would be full of the pets we would get

[Interlude: Jimmy Kimmel & Tyler)
Jimmy:
Tyler
Hey man how you doing ?
It's good to have you here

Tyler:
Hey Jimmy
You look nice

Jimmy:
Oh thanks
I was thinking that, uh, maybe if you just did it a little more, I don't know, like rhythmically, you know what I'm saying

Tyler:
Ohhhhh, okay, okay
Like a...?


Jimmy:
Like a rap, like kinda

Tyler:
Alright
Cool, cool

Jimmy:
Yeah, cool...
Alright

[Verse 2: Tyler]
NO !
Dad, would be mad, if we don't choose
We will end up with none
Jimmy...?

[Interlude: Jimmy Kimmel & Tyler)
Jimmy:
Uh, Tyler

Tyler:
You look nice

Jimmy:
Thank you
I guess what I, you know I just was hoping it would have more

What is the word I'm looking for, uh

I don't know what the word I'm looking for is

Tyler:
SWAGG ?

Jimmy:
No, not swagg...FLOW

Tyler:
Matthew McConaughey, no?

Jimmy:
No, not Matthew McConaughey

But, a little more flow, so like it would rhyme

Like pet, should I get

Tyler:
Ohhh, okay

I think I got it

(Speaking to crowd) you guys think I got it?

{Crowd cheers !}

[Verse 3: Tyler]
Okay, Um

I'll do it right now, I'll do what I said

I'll make up my mind, that's up in my head

The dog or a rabbit, the fish and the cat

I'll pick it up fast and that was this and that was that

Jimmy Kimmel this segment was whack

[Outro: Jimmy Kimmel]
No, that was good, that was actually really good
You did a lot better at the end
I think we really have something here
Dr. Seuss would be really proud
WAIT, aren't you supposed to drop the mic...I guess I'll just drop it, alright
