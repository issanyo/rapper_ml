[Verse 1]
Fly with the birds in the wind
Where you wanna go, who, what, why, when?
On a scale from nine to ten
You taking L's baby, hold my hand and feel like the wind
Now fasten your seat belt, and turn everything off
I got your attention, mothafucka I'm bout to take off
I'm the new pilot in this bitch
And I ain't bring no extra baggage for this trip
But I do bring a terror like I hate America
A brand new camera and a parachute
Nigga you and I are not the same, we not parallel
Don't talk to me 'fore I fuckin' embarrass you
Now sit your ass down you doin' three much
I'm the captain on this bitch, don't get it fucked up
Or you'll get fucked up

[Bridge]

[Verse 2]
I'm so far ahead of you niggas I'm in the future
Y'all don't even know about my existence, it's like I'm dead to you
You niggas, I'm sayin',look, y'all be on the stupid shit
I'm the fuckin' pilot, your role is to be the stewardess
I'm the fuckin' bomb like I was stuffing my shoe with it
The boy's a fucking problem like turbulence boy, get used to it
If anything happens its one door
If I see a building, motherfucker we're done for
I'mma hit a couple of 'em up this is Parkour
Better call your family and give 'em your last wishes, nigga
And every line dirty, you thought that I dug ditches
But I never give a fuck, it's like I was born dickless
I don't wanna crash anymore, I don't wanna crash anymore
I just wanna soar through the space, let the wind hit my face
Till there's nothing left in the gas tank
I don't wanna crash, I don't wanna crash anymore
I don't wanna crash anymore
I just wanna soar through the space, let the wind hit my face
Till there's nothing left in the gas tank, I don't wanna crash

[Bridge 2]
I'm in first class but I feel like coach, yeah
Uh, cause I'm in first class but I feel like coach, yeah
Uh, cause I'm in first class but I feel like coach, yeah
It's kinda weird
Cause I'm in first class but I feel like coach

[Verse 3]
I'm tryna find a place, a place where I can land at
A place where I can be
With no alphabet dictatin' where to stand at
You can buy a car, you can buy many things
You can buy happiness but you can't buy wings
You can buy a parachute, you can buy a parrot
But you can't buy a pair of wings, aerodynamic
To stay cloud level
That's why I'm in first class but I feel like coach
Cause I'm in first class but I feel like coach
It's just crazy how you can have everything in the world but
You in first class but you feel like coach, damn
That's why I'm in first class but I feel like coach
