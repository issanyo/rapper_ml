[Intro]
Niggas is just rapping 'cause like
Why not?
Golf boys, ayo

[Chorus]
I tip-tip-tip-tip toe in this bitch
Everybody got opinions everybody got tips
Tell them Twitter finger niggas they can cancel my dick, hmm
I tip-tip-tip-tip toe in this hoe
Somebody tell the devil that I'm knocking at the door

[Verse 1]
Ayo, ayo
In my mansion, niggas salsa dancing nigga
Smiling on me face, I'm so handsome nigga
I was edgy, nigga, now its Fetti
I get my backyard, oh that's the Getty
Nigga I, was in the garden couldn't fathom
It was snakes in the grass but I couldn't grab 'em
Focus on the Eve, nah focus on the green
In the trees with binoculars, looking for an Adam
Lemme tell ya, I got dreams to sell ya
Cause y'all reek of backwoods and some future failures
We was working deals, out finalizing hurdles
Y'all was out in Paris dick riding Virgil
Hope them Insta photos keep you cool in coach
Clout yeah, oh, you out here?
Oh, you network, where your self-worth?
Nigga dick ride 'til your neck hurt
Nigga we ok, boy better know BBK
You want war then I'm G.I. Joe
You get cooked nigga B-B-Q
I Diplo then go MIA
Then skate off like a T.I. role
Niggas pretend to be bosses
You signed a 360, you lost it
That's 400 for my exhaust, the mean with the walk
Now tell the Black Youth, to just be
Tell them never stop
Yeah we all moving, but you ain't gotta put us in a box
We can paint, we can draw, whatever
We can Lady Bird, we can Baby Boy
Whatever movie setting you choose
Just, just try to do better
And don't let them stretch you too thin, new leather

[Bridge]
I tip-tip-tip-tip toe in this bitch
I tip-tip-tip-tip toe run it (run it, run it, run it)

[Verse 2]
666 when we bag em, hmm
Y'all don't even know about the madam, hmm
Y'all can get the packet with the atom, boom
Summer just got a lil heater, yeah
Flower Boy gold no gimmicks, I joke
And I ain't have to fuck a Akademiks to post
No radio play like once or so
Y'all swear y'all got the keys
I play piano, stop
Nigga, I'm the ammo in the Glock
Church pants, sandals with the socks
You niggas done, you better get the mop
No violence, curly hair bounded at the top
No violence, ayo
Incredible with commas I, make ya stretch like Violet's mama, ay
I go Dash and handmade ones the, neck Frozone like papa's partner, say
Incredible with commas I, make ya stretch like Violet mama in
I go Dash and handmade ones the, neck Frozone like papa's partner, nigga

[Outro]
Runnin' in that bitch
At the bottom of the bitch
Had the doubles in the bitch
Double O, double O, double T
I was in a meeting, fucking with me
I ain't say nothing this off top of the dome
