[Tyler, the Creator]
I got guns in the fucking pan
Hit the band, nigga
AK47 in the land hit the dance, nigga
I don't got plans, I just go, go
Like the Roadrunner, where's the coyote?
It's Rocky and T, y'all ain't fucking with me
Please, had niggas singing "Stop" like it's Glee
Nigga chill
I'm real, I'm ill
I'm sickle cell

[A$AP Rocky]
Wait hold on, hold on, let me hit 'em with some soft shit

Hey beautiful girl
You already know we keep it trilla on the side
Got my nigga T on the side
Got the Caddy, that's the ride

[Tyler, the Creator]
Fuck that nigga, you gon' die
I don't play...
