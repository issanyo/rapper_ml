[Verse 1]
Tall skinny flaco, that's for my nigga Paco
I enchilada bitches and I'm eating up they taco
"Eat me, beat me like Chris did Rhi-Rhi"
F U, OF to the muthafucking D-E-A-T
HD-Ice cream is tasty
The paley pink pussy on these white bitches is pasty
Herpes, I probably got, sickness it's probably snot
Dripping and you being iller than me, probably not
I'm snorting lines of cokey, I do the hokey pokey
Dumber than corny jokester, horny hoes wanna poke me
I'm dope you wanna smoke me, you don't know the effects
Of an asshole perspective, fuck respect
I think my asthma flaring, but Sarah wasn't caring
She left, so I beat my fucking meat just like abusive parents
Hot like Fahrenheit, I'm tight just like virgin twat
Fucking awesome that I am but a lot of swag that I'm not
Ace the Creator, chronic masturbator

[Verse 2]
I'm sipping on some, pissing on some, kissing on some bitch
That I just met and I'mma fuck her, cause she wet
I use no rubber and I make it stretch like Flubber, what you thought
"I'm not under-covers" just like the cosby sheet on my cock like police be
Y'all niggas see me, AC, OF,fuck it

[Verse 3]
Macaroni, I'm horny, these bitches on me like herpes
These bitches coughing I'll eat they coochie, I'm burping like Burpie
These niggas looking at me like I'm Ernie, but I'm more Berthy
Shit that I'm rocking it ticking and tocking
No watch and no chain, I do not make it rain, I bring the drought
Cause it's money I'm without, the shoes is fucking beat up
The dirties fucking heat up, them nolly treasures see us
The "fuck you buster" skate video coming, two-thousand and nine
We fine, we flying high, in the sky
Naw we flying in Ocean, the potion, I got the motion like
Piano keys got these bitches on they knees
Begging please like uno, dos, tres, three
Mexican bitches they love the cock like they love the cheese
From overseas back to Africa-ca, I slappy ya
Like a kung-fu movie actor, get my fist and we attacking y'all
Y'all, naw, nigga no skinny jeans over here
Y'all niggas is queer, jerking with other niggas
Working with them other niggas, broke as fuck
Not counting figures but guess what, I'm happy with life
Me and niggas ballin' we broke though, we got yo ho though
Yellow t-shirts, like egg yolk though
Fucking clean, you know the hat it stay Supreme
The fucking closet full of Freshjive, Bape and Ice Cream
Half of it no charge, half it no barge
Half of it discount, half of it at bargain
Niggas is looking at us wishing they charge, like a charge car
But they can't cause this my credit card
Y'all niggas got blue shit, y'all not using them black cards
All y'all niggas front when in ya heels
While all y'all acting harder than dicks when they see a...bitch
Jasper what up nigga

[Verse 4 - With Jasper Dolphin]
Introducing, the shortest, oldest nigga I know, Jasper the Dolphin

Yo, I don't know how to rap but, fuck it, it's time to do some new shit in my life
