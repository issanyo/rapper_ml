[Intro]
Yeaaaah bitch
Wolf Gang
Sweatshirt, uh
Ho

[Verse]
Ninety-four rap music, beat a preacher's ass to it
Pigeon blood will leave the stool wall shitted up
Shit talk myrtle fuck, get your sister fucked
Shit, i hit the stripper up then go and pick a stick inside the fucking pots where we brew them bitches up
Rip your writtens while my niggas splitting, splitting blunts
Eyes hazed with my middle finger up a stripper's cunt
Lights down, lit her up, sherm in my sippy cup
Ice picking cripples till I get my pickle rub
Catch me popping pimples, telling bitches triple 6s
Stab 'em with pencils in their temples till my dick erupts
It's really fucking simple, slut
Wolf Gang, get with us
Either that or grab a full fist of nuts and lick 'em up
Turn it up, fisticuffs, give them bitches dick to suck
Let them drink the cum out of fucking paper cup
Pours wider than the horse that I'm sniffing up
Leave now if you ain't tryna get 'em titties touched
