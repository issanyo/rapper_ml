[Verse 1]
My chops make your ship steer off course
Yo I wave, And they're impressed by my elemental force
Of course I bring the worst to whoever want whatever
Swore i'll be hotter than whatever if you leave it in the desert

[Bridge]
My crowd wild, don't style for free
And if someone is talkin' money, point 'em out to me
What's a microphone genius without "Mike G"
And "awesome" without "me" is just not complete
That's why you see me walk around like this
With ambition as big as every continent
So I'll never suffer from lack of confidence
If I focus on all my accomplishments

[Verse II]
Yo I do it
Just to say you too could do what you want
My vision's clear as my conscience
My energy's on Monster
And no one will let me get over it
I must dream the biggest til I'm stackin' digits
And my women resemble Rihanna
But still, I'm raps new hope with no second guessing
I roll with a few hopes and hopeless obsessions
I can tell we raise hell when we break out of our shell
So saying we can't excell is like fishing in wishing wells

[Bridge]
My crowd wild, don't stop for free
And if someone is talkin' money, point 'em out to me
Hard work usually pays a price without a fee
So I must be the lyrical form of alchemy
That's why you see me walk around like this
With ambition as big as every continent
So you could never suffer from lack of confidence
If you focus on all your accomplishments

[Verse 3]
I train on tracks til I'm jumping over hurdles
Doing laps in parking lots as murder in black convertibles
You look forward to places that I've been
Past ten once again, tell a friend I get in at 8:10
Life's a waste if you don't apply what you observe
You should pay what you're worth, that's how you get what you deserve
Use Logic to fill my pockets
Bank a billion off of words
Steer well til' my brakes fail and wheels hit the curb
And they tell me life's short so cherish the days
And now we're all over magazines front page's
And this is fire coming out the speakers when it plays
And I can rap for days when I get beats from Ace...aye!
