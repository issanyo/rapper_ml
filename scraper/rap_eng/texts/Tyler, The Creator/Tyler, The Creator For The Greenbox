Skate park 'til the days dark
Then it's Roscoes with the whole fucking G Olf Wang
Wolf Gang same thing just the G's off
Sick fuck I got mini germs I feel like Adolf
Aye, Y'all motherfuckers thought I was gone fall off
Sorry, future brighter than what Stevie Wonder ain't saw
Ain't yaw jaw hurting from the hate, naw?
Ah fuck it mate... and my balls still ain't drop pause

Sick... Spittin' like the motherfucking droolin'
Ear to a sea shell listening to Frankie's new shit

Who's this motherfucking crew bringing cool back
To the rap bake sale makin' all the cake back
Made about one zero zero zero zero eight stacks
In a whole different fucking country where they hate rap
And they say 'Hey black, can I get my kids back?
You brain washed them with all that triple sixty six crap'
