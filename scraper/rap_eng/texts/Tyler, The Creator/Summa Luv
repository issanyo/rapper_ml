[Verse 1: JHawk]
She right left me
The plane flew away, now my soul is unhealthy
On flight American 47
My summer love left me, and faded into heavens
She came to LA on vacation, about the third day we was having relation
For two weeks she was my angel
The kisses were incredible, the dates uncomparable
With her, she took my key
The key to remain, relationship sanity
Now it was crazy
Fiending for her love, and texting her daily
Abstinence is what she went by
No sex, I pretended like I had respect
I thought that I was set
But I was in love, when I heard she was

[Hook]
My summer love, my summer love

[Verse 2: Tyler,The Creator]
28 karats of gold
That's almost 24 karats of glow
But bugs bunny said 24 carrots of old
That they been spoiled green bean
That's three layers of mold
I've got three layers of coolness
And one of them is lukewarm water
She's somebody daughter
Her brain is smaller than the other girls
I've got Sarah Belle umm
Man I love summer heat
Never told her
Can't tell her, about cars dealing
She gambles with my dentist
That's why I have feelings
She stole my heart but they didn't really need it
So I guess shes off, not guilty
Love jewellery, so filthy
Now were chilling at the beach
Corn on the chips, corn on her feet
Feet in the sand, Hands on her weave
She's the fish to my water
Summer love
She's the summer to my heat

[Hook]

[Verse 3:Hodgy Beats]
So I slide in
Cool like the breeze, feather
It's the Summer weather
I know this her blinging
Like rose gold, rose gold
I went to the dealer
And he sold gold, I chose gold
With a little bit of red bone
5'5 still pigeon toed
With her Keds on
Rasacha chey fitted caps
She the dope dealer type, the feds' drawn
Where my flow excels
I don't show and tell
And it's the summer baby, ring my bell
Her names Rochelle, I want road kill
Because sheâ€™s not after the money, leaving me broke as hell
This summer, this summer
I got jokes for sale, wanna buy one?
Girl, where the F you get this guy from?
This summer, this summer, this summer, yeah this summer

[Hook]
