[Part I]

[Intro]
Hey yeah, she was the love of my life
Girl, yeah, she was the love of my life
Girl, yeah, she was the love of my life
(That was like the last summer though, I dunno)

[Chorus]
After all this time, you lost your chance
You know you want me
After all this time, it's too late
Callin' on me
You lost you chance, get away from me
It's too late

[Verse 1]
It's too late for y'all to care
I've moved past all that I can
Why must you come back?
I didn't ask for this
I thought you were so over this
But now

[Chorus]
After all this time, you lost your chance
You know you want me
After all this time, it's too late
Callin' on me
You lost you chance, get away from me
It's too late

[Verse 2]
It was last summer don't think I forget
But now you're trying to come around, you want back in
But now with my best best friends
We on tour in ages, stacking good good hits
I know you're tired of your life
You wanna roll we me 'cause you knew that I was right
But now I got a girl, she 'bout to come right back
And she gon' whoop that ass unless you move back back

[Chorus]
After all this time, you lost your chance
You know you want me
After all this time, it's too late
Callin' on me
You lost you chance, get away from me
It's too late

[Bridge]
Hey yeah, she was the love of my life
(Like why, why you come back right now?)
Girl, yeah, she was the love of my life
(Like, everything's going so perfect)
Girl, yeah, she was the love of my life

(That's calling, stop calling...)
Girl, yeah, she was the love of my life
Girl, yeah, she was the love of my life
Girl, yeah, love of my life
Girl

(After all this time, you lost you chance
Now you want me)

[Part II]

[Outro]
After all this time, you lost you chance
Now you want me
I guess it wasn't meant to be
And after all this time, you say you love me
But what went wrong? You said you didn't belong to me
And after last summer we didn't speak
I know you're lonely, you'll never find another nigga like me
I see it didn't take long to see
After all this time, you lost your chance
Girl you want me
I guess it wasn't meant to be
And after all this time
You said you loved me
But what went wrong? You said you didn't belong to me
And after last summer we didn't speak
I know you're lonely, you'll never find another nigga like me
I see it didn't take long to see
(It's okay, good luck babe)

After all this time, you lost you chance
Now you want me
(I guess it's true then, what they say, huh?)
I guess it wasn't meant to be
(They always come back, huh?)
