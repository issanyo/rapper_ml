[Verse 1 : Dskillz Harris]
My mind is a pistol
Let's make it official
Promise your homies won't miss u
Watch me just rip through your tissue
I'm trippin that is the issue
I guess, I'm blessed with the sess
To reduce my stress
But I don't use it
The music is all
I need, 
They're hoping I fall
And I'm praying for help
Hoping he's saving us all
No longer caring for self
Brave in the face of danger and death
Born in the land of the strong
Wrong but taking my steps wisely
They tried to surprise me but I saw it coming
I'm running from nothing
Unless I'm paid at a marathon
This game is rigged, 
My arms are heavy as Barry bonds
DBL the crew is thick, so we lasting long
Trynna leave a good impression, 
Why am I stressing the fact
That I'm bout to go to college
But I'd rather just rap
But ima do both
Took some time off and u see That I show some new growth
Mama got a lawyer, and u chose, a dreamer
I hope that this works our
Cause ima Kirk out if I have to go the work route
Work a nine to five, and once again wear a uniform
Ima trynna stand out and never have to do the norm
So it's official
Life is a gamble and I scramble with this pistol
Aim it high to the sky
Hoping God doesn't take me early
Worthy of a noble death
