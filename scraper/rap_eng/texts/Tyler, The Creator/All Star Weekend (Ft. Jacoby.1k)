[Verse 1: @Yungbabyman]

Babyman fly he fly just like he NASA
You know I keep the heat I don't play Udonis Haslem
Put me in the game bench minutes is what you getting
I see red you get the horns I'm Jordan you Scottie Pippen
Kids gang gang man you pussies got me tripping
None of you folk ain't never been in my position
I'm just living how I'm living, pussy nigga come and get it
If you really think i'm chicken thats a two piece to your biscuit
(look) hold up lil mama you chillin you need a drink with that
All around the world I'm global now watch me bring it back
Babyman the coldest around can you agree with that
Round of applause she see me and then she make it clap

[Bridge: @Yungbabyman]

[Verse 2: Jacoby.1k]

So I had to creepin I'm that nigga let it sink in
I could never die keep it honest, Abe Lincoln
Think I'm more than high shit, see you next evening

I'm globally connected
And baby I'm well respected
If you think I'm lying 82-0 is my record
Ima bull ina china shop coming thru and I wreck it
Yousa loser pull ya card not talking debit or credit

Kobe with the shot pull up the 3 contested
Teaching dudes a lesson
My words my lethal weapon
Flow so hot make you sit down have a beverage
Don't ever disrespect it
You might as well accept it

I'm macho and you lame
I'm macho and you lame
If this was Gotham City
You the joker
I'm Bruce Wayne

Cuz Jacoby gonna ball like its All Star Weekend
Ima ball til I fall til my heart stop beating
Reggie Lewis way I do it til my heart stop beating
But I'm balling niggas up
Til the end of the season
