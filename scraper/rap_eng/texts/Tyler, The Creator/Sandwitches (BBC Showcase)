[Verse 1: Tyler]
Who the heck invited Mr. (I Don't Wanna Cuss)
Who cries about his dad in a blog (Because he always fusses)
Boy you messing up and truthfully I've had enough
And screw rolling papers (I'm a rebel dog, I'm asking what?)
Full of crap like I ate that john
Come on kids (Screw that class and hit that thong)
Let's buy stuff and get those kids with dads and moms
With nice homes, 41k's (And those shiny lawns)
Those little punks gotta learn, we ain't takin no mess
What's up man? Do your best
Cause I don't have no home meal to come to
So if you do I'm throwing fingers out screaming (Umm, ooh?)
I got a bunch of these, a bunch of these
Not Dahm, if I was a Dahm I would be Humpty
Green hat the color of a leprechaun with leprosy
Really 'bout it 'bout it like I'm Master P (In sixty five)
It's really immaculate the way your girl be smacking (Me)
Surprised she hasn't did school stuff in the alley oop
Golf Wang hooligans messing up the school again
Showing you and yours that doing stuff is really cool again
I'm going harder than a midget jumping over me
Look at my hat, it's cool
Punches to the stomach where that other stuff's supposed to be
Forget this man, yeah!

[Hook]
It's the Wolf Gang, Wolf Gang
Wolf Gang, triple six crew
(Turn me up, put your hands in the air, go Hodgy)

[Verse 2: Hodgy]
My love is gone for you Tommy, you can go figure
Now it's time for me to be a real, hey (Hold up)
This beat is real nice (Woo! Drop that, Sydney!)
So I'mma spit like I ain't never spit before
And I'mma walk through that.. door (Woo!)
And I'mma make all that.. dough
So is you messing with me? No
This that Wolf Gang, this that, this that Wolf Gang
Green hats and green gats, knocking everybody on their back
Mess around with me and I'm gon scratch your cat, uh!

[Hook]

[Outro: Hodgy]
They don't know us, they don't know us
They don't know where we from, they don't know nothing
I ain't joking
