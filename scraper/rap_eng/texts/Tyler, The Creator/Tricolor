The early chapters of my book included bus passes
Now its tire traction off like fuck crashes, ask him how?
Insurance higher than the lease bill, run flats when the feet peel
Fish tail, the boy eats meals, tummy ache from my cheap thrills
Granny hug the way the seat feel, on the left turn, leave the neck burned
From the frost bit links, size of an earth worm, wasted on last check earned
I’m, expecting this so it ain't odd, two 5’s on the paint job, lactose, wide body, fat ghost
Grannys watch over me when I act slow, rev till I plateau
Keys sorted on the hip, jeff gordon is his mind, life’s forza on the strip
Switch gears like I take breaths, wish I had 8
Left 6 got skipped, went to 7th from the 5th
More advance than your average
I like coupes, two shit
When my friends pull up, stops turn into a pageant
But until I get that enzo, its chapter uno
But I know what that bus pass turned into, its magic
