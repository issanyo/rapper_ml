(Verse 1)
"Kush & Orange Juice" I'm a bad apple
We had went to OGs then had got that handle
I just drink and smoke weed I don't like tobacco
All my weapons OP yeah I'm going Rambo
Bitch could suck my dick on both knees while I'm my Sandles
While I'm that chickens throat deep she gon light a candle
Caused I killed that pussy next and then I ate her asshole
Why do women always have to be hassle
-have half hope
Ain't no way to stay determined if you fuck with mad hoes
Pack the bowl, while we smoke , we gon hit that lick or no ?
Liquor store , never really mad when taking drags or when i hit the dope
Quarter Ps and Sawbucks since I been alone
Miss my home
Corner piece of pizza while I sip the coke
Script the poems
Nixon taught me how to Flip reciprocals
Ms Nixon cold
Chappiro and Deniro made me stick to notes
Sip the Pho'
If you got no kids you bitches give me hope!

And I don't what real love is
So I'm swimming in that pussy till she feels my dick
And all that bitch really wants is a kiss , in my defense I just meant to keep her 'way from my sins

(Bridge 1 )
I don't fuck with WHITE, girl but
Sometimes I fuck with white GIRLS
I split the blunt and try to pearl
Cause I dont really like this world
Hickey like my name is Earl
Picky when I pick my plurals
Jack me off or Piss me off then jack and a Jill went down the hill
Conscious I don't pop no pills
Bong rips of some extra kill
Cops can get obnoxious taking toxins( tape the box and seal )
Cautious still
The poppy fields we're crossing, splits in parts of nil
Narc are ill, undefined by dollars signs and parking bills

(Bridge 2)
I was taught to kill
Now my thought are ill
I was taught to kill
Now it's hard to feel

(Verse 2)
I know I don't DESERVE your forgiveness but
I'm sorry for the way that I had treated you
So sorry for the way that I would SPEAK to you
Cause getting close to me girl some shit you didn't need, that's true
You should be conceited too !
I hope you know everything that self esteem could do
( I think you special)
I mean I Knew was an asshole
But really girl I never really meant to make you sad though
Cause what we had that shit was mad dope
Its funny how's theres patterns in this life like codes
Ain't fucking with no goofy bastards that gon pose
Play that back so all the real dumb fucks will know
Girl I'm glad I took a chance though
If they ask would I ever change the past - no
Just Roll the dice or "take a chance" bro , it really shouldn't ever take this long for y'all to "Pass Go"
And we can't blame that shit on Hasbro
I had to take my hat off too other rappers- damn soul
I must've stepped into some black snow
Am I dreaming? I been feeling Just a tad low
I think you loved me cause I lacked hope, I was your first but surely will not be the last though
It's a curse it's been a burden to be that cold
I knew I'd lose my mind But who'd of known I'd lose my dad bro

(Bridge 3)
Night terrors tearing me to pieces
So even if I sleep I seem to think of all my demons
I had this Lucid dream about an incubus thats scheming
But I can't move a inch because the succubus is teething

Monks in Tibet watch the sun share secrets
Can't we fight with our pens, Drop the guns start reading?
Puncture the neck then the lungs stop breathing
Baby Once your in debt then yours funds start freezing

(Verse 3)
I just want a neosoul princess for a hook lets make a chorus
Play some ancient pagan playlists
Make you shook I pray to Horus
Take some dabs and then we pass out all relaxed right by the forest
All these tourists, up in Porsches, never seent them here before (shit)
Teaching her some yoga while she reads up on my Aura
Got a pack lagunitas then we chill up in the forest
Damn baby, what you finna give me four kids?
The way that pussy smells , I can't help but feel more P.I.M.P
And No offense , cause just between us I drank 4 fifths
Daddy you so big, got just the penis for my whore lips
And No offense , cause just between us I drank 4 fifths
To demean you I just need to make you read bitch

That was petty I know christian didn't mean that
Move faster , or you'll never see that lead, man
Blue Patterns on my draws Man eat a dick
Bruce banner you don't wanna see me mean Kids

(Outro)
Sometimes I act ruthlesss
Sometimes I act good
Instead of mending the fences 
I'm meddling with these hooks
Yes I mess with the muses
I get it all from their looks
Some guys will make ends some guys will make crooks
