Got bottles, got bitches, got aim on you snitches
No time for fractious bitches acting like a witness
Run, call it fitness
My dick, thats the business
And it got that bigness
Fuck the cops, they piglets
I don't fuck with thots, cause they fucking witless
"What you talking about Willis? My bitches got thickness,"
Hit that shit with swiftness, hit it than I ditch it

I stay flexing like a gymnast, I ain't stressing on the digits, I ain't stressing on the disses, I distress the clique like Christmas
Vicious bitches... They come with quickness... Ima fuck yo hoe and mistress

(yeah, uh, yeah)

And we do it everyday, all the time screaming: "FUCK BITCHES THAT HATE."
I've been moving forward, ya'll running in place, they just copy like stencils, they on me, they trace...

I say fuck your head hoe, your teeth got some stains (x3)

You know I got bread hoe, you know that I bake (I bake)
I follow my goals, do not believe in fate
I see through these hoes, they just fake cellophane
They trying to copy, they wanna take my name
I get that Glock and I aim for they brains

I leave all against me deranged and insane
Don't try to run up on me, I'll leave you sank
I get myself money, I go to the bank (the bank)
You think that it's funny and you'll get de-ranked
I would fuck your hoe, but her pussy just stank
This life isn't free, gotta pay, gotta pay

(Yeah, pretty much)
(What do we do? What do we do? Fuck you...)

Yeah, and we do it everyday, all the time screaming: "FUCK BITCHES THAT HATE."
I've been moving forward, ya'll running in place, they just copy like stencils, they on me, they trace...

I say fuck your head hoe, your teeth got some stains (x3)

And I don't fuck with bitches if they stank
