[Verse 1]
I was the most innovative, the most creative
I used to make space ships then I would fly away
My swag at 100, mind thinking brighter days
I want that big money right away
Now I just sit up in my room and write away like let's do it
I'm ready for whatever, I'm ready for the cheddar
My biggest vendetta was being the best dresser
So Lauren, this that shit you could get dressed to
I this that rhythm I can think about my ex to
And look to the left [?] what I'm next to
So who next fool? I'm the best contender
I'm rolling up my summer thinking winter

[Hook]
What you saying though? How you living kid?
What you mean by that? Oh this another hit?
Man this is that shit, something different
And this is me and I ain't worried bout fitting me
What you saying though? How you living kid?
What you mean by that? Oh this another hit?
Man this is that shit, something different
And this is me and I ain't worried bout fitting me

[Verse 2]
I always think the good life when I write
Always leave the laces loose on my Nikes, yeah
And I can give a damn in my Vans
Living life in a trance, always feel like the man
I'm pulling my pants and lean back like that
I don't be in moods, that's why I act like that
That's why I rap like that
They gon' have a hard time telling me what I lack
Telling me that I ain't that
I tell 'em now they gon' see
Yeah I'm the 09 freshman
The young CV, I thank PNC
The Creator on the drums, we so OD
Y'all ain't nothing like me, y'all some lil hypebeasts
White T, neck V [?]
With the homies posted up until they get me
I'm iffy on you niggas, y'all ain't with me
So I stay solo and let the dough blow
Let's go

[Hook]
What you saying though? How you living kid?
What you mean by that? Oh this another hit?
Man this is that shit, something different
And this is me and I ain't worried bout fitting me
What you saying though? How you living kid?
What you mean by that? Oh this another hit?
Man this is that shit, something different
And this is me and I ain't worried bout fitting me

[Verse 3]
The west coast, I'm bragging while I boast nigga
Let's propose a toast homie, I'm focused
So easy and you already know this
I'm not worried bout you niggas, y'all ain't on my radar
I mean what I say dog, girls get piped down
[?] they are [?] he ball
You short niggas, he tall, he raw
Number uno, you zero
You wack rappers catch a lock jaw
Locked down, I got y'all, not far
I'm too stand up, you in the crowd put your hands up
And what
In 09 man, I'm balling like a free throw
Stunting on you niggas like I'm Evil Knievel
It's [?]
[?]
I don't know what you see though

[Outro]
What's good, this [?]
Just to let niggas know this shit bout to take off soon
Casey Veggies, Customized Greatly Volume 2
It's totally something different
Watch when my nigga blow
All y'all niggas bout to be [?]
Swag up and I'm out
