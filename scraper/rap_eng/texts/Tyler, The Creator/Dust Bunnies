Still drawin' hopscotch chalk on sidewalks for the fun
Like the Korn album cover with kids on the front and
Lately I been throwin' up, full of disgust
I’m old enough now to see how fast I’m growin' up and
It’s hard to open up when no one givin' a fuck but
I’m sick of countin' change for the train and the bus
And I’m so tired of it rainin' on the days that I’m stuck
Without a buck, thunderstruck, new shoes in the mud and
Sick and tired of the kids with the knives and the guns
Thinkin' they tough, aimin' up and never lettin' it bust and
Never trustin' a one that slither, rattle, they tongue
Cause when the snakes Slytherin, that’s when the Gryffindor won
I’m tired of women always frontin', skippin' and stuntin', and trippin' callin' me they husband but I’m nothin'
I’m sick of jumpin' to assumptions
Fumblin' trust, thinkin' you up to somethin', dismissin' my judgement
Tired of hearin' that you only lied to me because you got self-diagnosed depression and anxiety
So sick of attachment and I ain't havin' it
I’m not a masochist to attack for your own
Happiness
And I let you you play victim, convince myself that I’m the issue
And dismiss manipulation thinkin' that I’m better with you and
It’s difficult admittin' I miss you, without a tissue
But I can’t be with you because the cycle continues
Ya’ll rappers actin like a child with no candy bar
Poppin' Xanny bars and makin' manic stars panic hard
Y’all got chemical dependencies
Suicidal tendencies, sippin' Hennessy for the assemblies
Ain’t no threat to me, I got the recipe to peace
Mess with me, get a hysterectomy straight from me
And I ain’t emo or nothin', I’m just an individual
With situational issues, writin' to make my thoughts physical
Through poetry, and this is my therapy alternative
To government therapist, mental terrorist embarrassment
