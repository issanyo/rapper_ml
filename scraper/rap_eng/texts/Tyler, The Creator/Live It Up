[Verse 1]
Say, babe, I'm liking what you do to me
So how about you and me, keep it up, keep it up
Hey lady, did you know you were the reason
Never catch me leaving, so keep it up, keep it up

[Bridge]
I don't give a, what people say
They're going to talk either way
Let's just have fun while we can enjoy ourselves

[Chorus]
Don't wanna give it up, might as well live it up
Don't wanna give it up, might as well live it up
Don't wanna give it up, might as well live it up
Don't wanna give it up, so we might as well live it up

[Verse 2]
Hey babe, and since my new addiction
You got me lifted, so keep me up, keep me up
Hey lady, if you're ever feeling saucy
Tell me when you want me to beat it up, beat it up

[Bridge]
I don't give a, what people say
They're going to talk either way
Let's just have fun while we can enjoy ourselves

[Chorus]
Don't wanna give it up, might as well live it up
Don't wanna give it up, might as well live it up
Don't wanna give it up, might as well live it up
Don't wanna give it up, so we might as well live it up

[Verse 3]
We don't have to rush it, we can take our time, take our time
But we both know what we want, want, so what's it gonna be?
And no one has to know it but us, but us baby
Just my love, I finally found someone who actually agrees

[Bridge]
I don't give a, what people say
They're going to talk either way
Let's just have fun while we can enjoy ourselves

[Chorus]
Don't wanna give it up, might as well live it up
Don't wanna give it up, might as well live it up
Don't wanna give it up, might as well live it up
Don't wanna give it up, so we might as well live it up
