Mmm
Treehome
Bridge!

[Bridge 1: Coco O & Tyler]
Colorful you are
Yeah, that won't stop
You're my favorite crayon in the box
Let's think outside the lines
Come to my treehouse, yeah letâ€™s escape
Then let me go, head first in your lake
From what I heard, it's great
It's great
There's a party

[Verse 2: Erykah Badu & Tyler]
Tuesday is good news day
Not usually a full tray
Can you pack your PJs?
There's a party
Come into my treehome
Boy, you must be special
I'm special, baby
No one ever comes here

[Bridge 2: Erykah Badu]
Tuesday is good news day
Not usually a food tray
Boy, you must be special
Come into my treehome
Boy, you must be (Let's go to my tree house baby)
Let's just escape
Let's go to my tree house baby
Special

Lets just escape
You and me
Oh, he's special
Let's just escape
Will you come into my tree house?
