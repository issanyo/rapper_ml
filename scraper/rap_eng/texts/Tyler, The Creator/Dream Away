[Verse 1]
Hey girl, sit down let me talk to you
All them dudes glance but they ain't got a chance
That's why they hate me
Cause every time I say something they do whatever to put me out there
But they squares with no life of their own
All them dudes basic
You a college girl tryna make it
I just want you, no other girl I'm chasing
So can you tell me
How long I'm gon' wait til we have that first date
You ain't never met a dude so real
And no I'm not [?], ain't that type of deal
Look so right shirt jeans so tight
Looking like good but you look much better
You got something that the other girls never had
Naturally sexy, I don't care about them other girls
I just want you right next to me cause

[Hook]
Girl you're so hot, girl you're so cool
Be around you yeah, I always act a fool
But when I look at you, all I really wanna do
Is make your mind, give you all of my time
Girl you're so hot, girl you're so cool
Be around you yeah, I always act a fool
But when I look at you, all I really wanna do
Is make your mind, give you all of my time
Cause girl you're so hot

[Verse 2]
Yeah now I'm going verse two
Girl there's more things I got to tell you
So I write you a song cause
If I call you, you treat me like the rest
All you think I'm bout the sex
Girl I'm bout the best
Them other dudes you mess with don't care
They just go for the next, yes
I had to get that off my chest
Fuck Bonnie and Clyde
That line over-used, let's set a new record
For the greatest and the latest love, the sky's the limit
We can ride above forreal
Ain't nothing more real than I'm telling you
Girl you know I got to have you like a kid at the grocery store
No junk, no sweets
You're the one I wanna eat
I know you like that
I want it all yes, all strings attached

[Hook]
Girl you're so hot, girl you're so cool
Be around you yeah, I always act a fool

Girl you're so hot, girl you're so cool
Be around you yeah, I always act a fool
But when I look at you, all I really wanna do
Is make your mind, give you all of my time

[Bridge] x2
I can show you something real, other dudes front
Baby I will not tell you lies

We don't even have to rush
Now we can just chill, we can just chill
I can show you something real, other dudes front
Baby I will not tell you lies

We don't even have to rush
Girl we can just chill, we can just chill

[Verse 3]
I look into your eyes all up on them thighs
Me and you together together girl, we can just shine
You're everything I fantasize
Nice smile, slim waste, nice ass, great taste
Enough time wasting
I been trying to be with you since the first day I met you
And that's just how I feel
So tell me what's the deal
Tell me how you feel, feel, feel
