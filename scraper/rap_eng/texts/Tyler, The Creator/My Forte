[Verse 1]
I'm in the room with 7 titties, that's 4 bitches with one missin'
With eleven twisted up Sherbinskis, some Bodillaz
Her 450, cookin' dope in a gold skillet
Bumpin' old 50, hit my robe with the gold stichin'
In my gold kitchen, gold bitches with painted toes tippin'
All these bitches taste like chicken, can't name a hoe different
Prolific, was zip-flippin' and kickin' door-hinges
PO done snitched to the boys, he said we all did it
Augmented my lifestyle, so now we all livin'
Get my dick sucked right now, while in the stall, pissin'
Bald bitches with car skimmers splittin' cigars with us
Couldn't carry us like pallbearers with they paws missin'
Targetin' pussy niggas, hit 'em with arsenic
Starvin', bitch, hit the kitchen, make something marvellous
Partial splits, I can't get with; bitch, I need all of it
AUG equipped, get to spittin', hit up your cardigan
Don't make me pull up and do you like room raiders
Throw your bitch in a cage and line it with newspapers
Double up, think I love her, but don't play us like dual Segas
'Fore your people search for your body like fuckin' Tomb Raider
Unh, I'm Voldemort with the whore, don't wan' smell her pussy
No conversations with shorty, give her emails to book me
I break a bitch and make her do 17 like Cookie
If I'm sentenced, conjugal visits and dope in her coochie

[Chorus]
Yeah, uh-huh, okay, okay
Black negroes, San Pellegrinos, Gabbana Dolces
Tax 3 Os, beat a nigga like he a court case
Feel like Max Keeble, Filipino bitches my forte
Unh, yeah, uh huh, okay, okay
Black negroes, San Pellegrinos, Gabbana Dolces
Tax 3 Os, beat a nigga like he a court case
Feel like Max Keeble, Filipino bitches my forte

[Verse 2]
Get behind that bitch like an investment
The game more hectic 'cause I blessed it
When I don't want it no more, I neglect it
Can't even neglect what ain't my possession, number one lesson
These niggas soft and sweet as big Texas, so get the message
Pillow Pet ass niggas, strap concealed under my shirt
So all you see is silhouettes and black figures
Shoot him in his back, nigga, so when they turn him over
He easy to recognize like tagged pictures, we blacklist him
Bag him, toe-tag him, and wrap him up like Christmas
Pull all his teeth out like the dentist, now he need dentures
I'm the boy with the frozen soul, I come alive in the winter
Don't eat around me, when I'm hungry, I'll take your dinner
Like, bruh, man, I hate to see niggas guts go splat in public
When I bust it, but fuck it, this snub love it
Pissin' out windows when we couldn't afford buckets
Now a wrist out the window and glist' on my bicuspids
Play the bitch, you niggas get split like vanilla Dutches
He the snitch, throw the chump in the trunk like he the luggage
Gave him tits, you should not wear jewelry, so, nigga, tuck it
Fake niggas don't got our blood in they genes, they step-cousins

[Chorus]
Yeah, uh-huh, okay, okay
Black negroes, San Pellegrinos, Gabbana Dolces
Tax 3 Os, beat a nigga like he a court case
Feel like Max Keeble, Filipino bitches my forte
Unh, yeah, uh-huh, okay, okay
Black negroes, San Pellegrinos, Gabbana Dolces
Tax 3 Os, beat a nigga like he a court case
Feel like Max Keeble, Filipino bitches my forte
