[Verse: TILFALL]
This ain't what I want
Passed out on the curb, no no no
Don’t wanna live this life
Fucked up so high
Look towards the sky
Feel you in my arms
Feel you then and now
Love it is gone, Love is so wrong
Sexual pleasures, drastic measures
Them pretty pink shoes that you always wearin'
Fucked so many girls but I ain't stop caring
I love you man I swear you’re the best
I love it when you put your hands on my chest
She tell me go deep
I'm still on the beat tho
Run thru the game like cheeta
Most hated, most played
Fuckin bitches insane tho
Run it up like Usain tho
Run it up like Usain tho

[Verse 1]
In the red forest, walking alone
Where is it taking me
Spiritual past, murder the mass
Leading a ship, I crash the mast
Where am I, lost in time
Fucking these bitches

[Interlude]
Wait shit that doesn't rhyme

[Verse 2]
Back on my bullshit I just create
I am not tyler
Murder so many, I am like myers
Oscar the grouch, in a bad mood
Draining myself, I cannot feel
Arms are bleeding, dripping like Gunna
Too many girls, I need another

[Verse]
In factual facts I spit to rhyme and attack
I make sense within these walls built up only to graze
The rush of life, shits an endless craze
I wanna be home when my back ain't sore
Sick of the cold nights, that I stayed away
The bottle empty, I swear I'm to blame
So I'm on the block, selling O's for my mom
Tryna make her keep custody but shit it's been bugging me
Can’t do much else when I’m cooped up in my room
Writing all these symphonies
Manifest my thoughts and feelings like the epiphany
You don't even know me
That was 3 years ago
Yeah, we were homies but where you at now
Investigate an opp like the last name Comey
Hop up in my car man this shit is extra roomy, move me
Make me feel special
I don’t want no freak hoe I swear that shit is extra
Let me text ya, slide that number
I'll treat you better man I swear there is no other
Met up with her now she my baby
How far have I come man this shit is so crazy
Roll up a blunt to pass time
I'm in a good mood so don't try, to fuck up my vibe
Aincent tune, African tribe
Saw her cheat, yea I cried
Life crumbled, atleast I tried
She cheated again, I just sighed

[Skit]
Well it looks like he’s a little disoriented or something
It's always possible the guy could be on something
