[Intro]
And I present to you
To you all
The Odd Future compilation
Fuck, give it up
Starring
Casey V, Hodgy Beats, Left Brain, Super 3, and Tyler, the Creator
Give it up! Give it up for ‘em!
Will y'all shut the fuck up?
Damn, I’m here
Alright, let me configure this
Get this ready
Alright, let’s go

[Tyler, the Creator]
Nigga seventeen his own fucking magazine
And of course his Hunger Force is Aqua Teen by all means
Fuck a deal, signature is legible
I'm the reason why niggas is heatin' up they vegetables
From being bullied in the sixth, to being dissed by any bitch
That can breath, please throw me in a ditch
And I hope I sell a copy of this disk
Fuck Hope, I am one short, a miracle of wish
Whether you nigga or ese, the magazine is great
Because the articles an essay
Half you dumb niggas can't even write an essay
Cause all of ya'll some stupid asses, S.A
You motherfuckers in denial
I'm the square just like the tile, right down the fucking isle
Music was my only friend, ever since I was a child
I make niggas frown, just to give myself a smile
Mother was my father, the nigga didn't bother
To send a kid a dollar, my only role model was
Niggas that record and that could play keyboards
And wild piano chords make me happy
Dr. Suess more important than Jesus
Y'all immigrants to depression, nigga give me a visa
We sick, the same lames that sneeze us
Made us turn to Jazz now, because the black kids would tease us
I need a fucking chain, I need to make it rain
I need some fucking rims, a car that I can rent
A verse about swag, jeans sagging off my ass
No I don't, fuck that, I am not a fucking fag
I rhyme and I'm still scared of guns
In the marching band but I bang my own drums and
Sing my own song, all of my wrongs are right
Never got into a fight, hit me
Bass, drum, snare, let it go
Disappear like good music in the past year
And everybody do the same thing, I hear the same shit
All the time, like the radio is queer
This isn't a mixtape, it's more of ear rape
By kids who think you other niggas suck
It's very offensive, you niggas defensive
If you can't take the heat then get the fuck out the kitchen, listen

[Outro]
Tyler the Creator, Hodgy Beats, Super 3, Casey V, Left Brain
Enjoy the show, good night, thank you, and fuck you
