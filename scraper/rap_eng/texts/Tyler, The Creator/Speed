[Verse 1: Kali Uchis] (x2)
You don't really know what you got yourself into
Boy, you think you know, but it just ain't that simple
I don't got the time, you should
Read between the lines, cause you're
Skimming through the pages, it's
Really looking dangerous

[Chorus: Kali Uchis] (x2)
When I'm driving in your car
Make me feel like I could do anything
But I do not have the drive
I'm in desperate need of your speed
Of your speed, of your speed, of your speed

[Verse 2: Kali Uchis]
Baby I can feel it coming, tell me, is it coming true?
Maybe it was going perfectly the way you planned it to
Lately I been thinking all I really wanna do is go
Faster, can we go faster
Something in the air, I really just don't wanna take it slow
If we waste the time, I think it might just make me miserable
Lately I been thinking all I really wanna do is go
Faster, can we go faster

[Bridge: Kali Uchis] (x4)
You better hit your brakes
'fore you crash, boy, crash

[Chorus: Kali Uchis] (x2)
When I'm driving in your car, make me feel like I could do anything
But I do not have the drive, I'm in desperate need of your speed
Of your speed, of your speed, of your speed

[Bridge: Kali Uchis] (x4)
You better hit your breaks
'fore you crash, boy, crash
