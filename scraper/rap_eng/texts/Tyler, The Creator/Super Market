[Intro: Syd]
Hi, welcome to Fuckey Foods. Umm, this lane is open if, if you need, if you to check out. Uhh, you're buying uh, donuts and a pack of Diet Pepsi? Sweet, okay makes sense

[Tyler]
In this fucking line at Ralph's buying granola bars
Left my member's card
And now this shit gon' have an extra charge
This old bitch in front of me buying a color printer
TV dinners, tampons, soy milk, paint thinner

[Domo]
So here I am at the store for some chips
That I'mma pay for with dimes, nickels and quarters and shit
And I'm still high, so I'm tryna dip
But I'mma cut through the line to get outta this bitch

[Tyler]
What the fuck, who the fuck's this gay nigga in fake Gucci?
Jordan numbers, whatever, wood chain with a Jesus
Hey you, what the fuck you think you doing?

[Domo]
Nigga, fuck you, I'm just eating Ruffles and gotta lotta stuff, fool
So, why don't you fucking wipe that stupid look on your face

[Tyler]
Don't make me shoot up this place with lightsabers and guns
And shoot caps at kneecaps to make it harder to run
And put your ankles in some boards and pissy water for fun, ugh

[Domo]
Nigga, I'm a samurai, cut your skinny ass in half
Look up at the aftermath, blow some fucking hash and laugh

[Tyler]
I'm a fucking ninja and a jedi and I'm from Compton
Better pick a better option 'fore these Nikes get to stomping
Chomping at your oxygen cords, you fat fake Kenan Thompson
Like a virgin, cherry faggot, we could get it poppin'

[Domo]
I bet you lock and drop it, faggot bitch, you ain't from Compton
Dumbo ears, you Mary Poppins, with the piece that Kel was rockin
I will fucking beat your ass, box logos through the glass
I'll hit you hooky like you skipping class, Lee would get the math

[Tyler]
Oh, really? You're silly giving tip drills to Nelly
Get them Ruffles no Lays cause Kiara might kill me
Aw, fuck this! I'm grabbing two kitchen knives
And stabbing this Ice Cube look-a-like
To show you a nigga with attitude

[Domo]
Wait, I heard about you from that other nigga Earl
How you traveled to Milan and now it only likes girls
I'll roundhouse you into a fucking basket
Push you into an old lady bagging plastic
Hope you get the message, I will stomp you into potholes
And fill you up with shells, but you're used to eating tacos

[Tyler]
Oh, a Taco joke?
Domo smoke, I heard your album
Sound like some shit a fake Wiz Khalifa poppa wrote
I'm insulted, shit, damn, somebody grab the Charmin
Never mind these messages, Monica her nigga arming

[Domo]
Swift-made switch blades made a big incision in him
Red dot his forehead â€˜cause Riley's into Hinduism
And hipsters who happen to be your listeners
Doobies roll your booty, ho, Alexis know the truthy, bro

[Tyler]
Oh, a Lexus? I drive all that around
The western hemisphere like all of Kiara's exes
And bet this, I'm a mothafuckin' monster
Fuck talking, I'll stab you with this fucking rocket launcher

[Domo]
When I cock the beam back, I'm aiming for Supreme hats
Go to Hell, I mean that, burn you like greenbacks

[Tyler]
You don't mean that, you faggot, I'll get your back
And I'll snap it, and strangle you with that fucking leather jacket
Fall, bitch, give me everything, I'm taking all this
And fleeing the scene on Rufus, my evil walrus, bitch
Fuck you, I'm out

[Domo]
I'm high as fuck and I didn't call for all this
I'mma get on my zombie shit, wait, here's my carcass

[Outro: Syd]
Sir... sir... sir, in the green hat, sir. You... you... you have to pay for that. You have to, the Arizonas, you have to pay for those. I fucking hate this job... Fuck, clean up on aisle six
