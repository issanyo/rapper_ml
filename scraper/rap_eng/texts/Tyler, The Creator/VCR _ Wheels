Part 1 - VCR

[Verse 1]
I don't want to play you
I just want to tape you undressing
And I'll lay you down and record soft porn
If it's romance then it's hardcore
If it's horror, pop the popcorn
The thoughts to rape you really turns me on

[Chorus]
Press my buttons baby
Press my buttons
Press my buttons baby
Yeah
Press my buttons baby
Press my fucking buttons baby
Press my buttons baby

[Verse 2]
You're my favorite show, any chance I get I try to watch
Die hard fan can't stop with the tapings
Sort of like a psycho when I can't stop with the rapings
Of the VHS, especially during sex baby

[Chorus]
Press my buttons baby
Press my buttons
Press my buttons baby
Yeah
Press my buttons baby
Press my fucking buttons baby
Press my buttons baby

[Verse 3]
Ready to watch? I'm a slip it in the tape deck
But put it in slow-mo, I don't want to bust the tape yet, press play
Now this is what I call an evening
A live show, almost equivalent to the screening
Your dream movie? I'm the clearest copy
Now time for Blow, I'm Johnny deep with the rarest poppy
Snort a little, now you're getting groovy
Cause I'll kill if I find out you're watching some other movies, bitch

[Chorus]
Press my buttons baby
Press my fucking buttons
Press my buttons baby
Yeah
Press my buttons baby
Press my fucking buttons baby
Press my buttons baby
Yeah
Press my buttons baby
Press my fucking buttons baby
Press this
Stop!

Part 2 - Wheels

[Verse 1]
Danielle, Danielle, yeah you heard about Raquel
Well that didn't go well, let us try to make it swell
Put the beaver in the mail, we can take it slow like snail
Lock my heart up, this is jail, throw away the key

[Chorus]
Can I sleep over, and wake up next to you?
I want to feel you near, just let me whisper in your ear, um

[Verse 2]
We can kick it on the couch, blunt you can roll it up
But I'm on some shrooms if you really want to feel the room
I just want to kick it, kick it for the rest
I skated all day, I just need some rest and your breasts

[Chorus]
Can I sleep over, and wake up next to you?
I want to feel you near, just let me whisper in your ear, um

[Verse 3]
We can count the stars on the hood of your father's car
He's a buster anyway, I can take him any day
Look into your eyes I realize that I like you so much
That was corny, now I'm horny, can I have a kiss?

[Chorus]
Can I sleep over, and wake up next to you?
I want to feel you near, just let me whisper in your ear, um

[Verse 4]
We both teenagers with the same mind state
How about some ice cream and some South Park for this first date?
Your cat is waiting for that raw fish I can't wait, get it?

[Chorus]
Can I sleep over, and wake up next to you?
I want to feel you near, just let me whisper in your ear, um
