[Verse 1: Hodgy Beats]
I get high in Ohio
Fucken' coke and a smile
Devil reading the bible
Reverends triggered the rifle
Animal heads important to the back yard again
Bury the Backyardigans
Blood covers my button up in step fathers cardigan
Erect a pistol, eject a clip full of missiles
A bodybag, to clean the gory issue
Closed casket, faggot, burn the house down with you
End this shit to end this shit
Does heaven have a membership?
Because I pick up angels by a pistol whip
This time she's so beautiful and me
Unusual to see
Shove her in the trunk, you can go with me
You like my FreshJive shirt, well I can give you one for free
Cause' when I wished for it I found me on a killin' spree
...Just leave up to me

[Verse 2: Tyler The Creator]
My mom caught me jackin' off to Hannah Montana with a banana peel
Sippin' a cherry Fanta to match my dress and my purple heels
Looking like I'm Santa but skinny in a black weave, it's real
In a stolen truck with my license to kill
I tell em' "I'm Frank from Montana, the king of the hill"
Except I'm a nigga from the junk yard gang
Bill Cosby couldn't spot me if I copied a duck in a bill
Simply cause I do not give a fuck like virginity
Illmatic with the tactics
I do not give a fuck how you feel, I got wolf
I flow backwards like heat when it chills on a thermometer
A skatin', rappin', composin' photographer is
Back like a black bitch's hairline, kilometer
Hotter than Madonnadoo-doo mama back-up dancers with the windows rolled up inside the Honda driving through Nevada during summer
Tyler, comma, the Creator is a fucking animal
I'm such spitting like a llama nigga
