Sometimes, I sit in my room and think about us
Ayo
You got them long lashes, couldn't get the dirt in em'
Curls on your head look like waves I'ma surf in em'
Wave at the camera, the paps ask your role
I evade any answer, but if you ain't a dummy
Shit is laid in these stanzas, kidnap my feelings
I ain't paying any ransom, I, keep em' like secrets
Might, drive a nigga crazy but I'm, beepin' like, beepin' like, beepin' like pages on a hip waist trainer, Yeugh!
Sometimes, I sit in my room

"It's Golf Radio, you're on the air with Shane Powers
Taking requests... What's uh... What's your name? Hello? Um, okay, well, since, you want to be Mr. Fucking Secret Agent, what song you wanna hear?"
