[Intro]
Maaan, you a hoe (brrt!)
(Mommy stop, I was filming!)
This ain't okra maaan there’s no flow
Buy a nonstick paaan that's the goal
(I just ate like 5 Big Macs bro)
Frick 'cause I can’t

(Run it, run it, run it, run it)

[Verse 1]
Check my bankroll ayo
48 cents for vehicle
Blowjob look like Bradley's ankles
On Django
We Minecraft skins look mango
My sandwich needs lots of mayo
Eat it slow please don't choke
Or you'll go to the hospital
And get touched like shades of greyo
Lil Tay flexing on y'all haters
Broke ass haters out the bayou
Battle bus drop y'all die at loot
Take L's
Eat Big Macs and Quarter Pounders and
Chicken nuggets
Suck it
Travel bag from Ross and Goodwill
Look like Koreans with Gucci
DAF BOYZ album Stop be buggin'
Lil Tay fans be buzzin’
Grammy nominated, jk we can’t even make an album

[Bridge]
Maaan, you a hoe
This ain't okra maaan there’s no flow
Buy a nonstick paaan that's the goal
Frick 'cause I can't cuss that’s for sure

[Verse 2]
Crocs not the shoe
Red with the blue
Look like Spiderman
What the frick it do?
DAF be the set
My name Jeff
Got a lot of women
Call me Hugh Heff
I just ate like 5 big macs and
[indistinct mumbling]
100 on my wrist, 80 on my wrist
[indistinct mumbling again]
Gucci Gang, aye?

[Bridge]
Maaan, you a hoe
This ain't okra maaan there's no flow
Buy a nonstick paaan that's the goal
Frick 'cause I can't cuss that's for sure

[Verse 3]
Tell Bill Cosby to come get at me
Skin glowing, so much acne
Playing Fortnite and a guy one tacked me
You know any girls that wanna tap me?
Just kidding, I be into history
That gay shizzle better miss me
1812 the Alamo like Crockett
Then I put the extra cash in my pocket 'cause
Rain drop and
Drop top so
Gordon Ramsay has a crock pot
Now I'm just saying random things
While I eat my spicy chicken wings
'Cause I really don't care anymore
This video and song is complete trash
We edited this in one day
So you can just eat my a—

What

Hi, my name is Eminem
Ya girl, she want an M&M
So I gave her an M&M (ayy)
And M&M&M&M&M

{Outro]
(Oh shoot)
Maaan, you a hoe
This ain't okra maaan
