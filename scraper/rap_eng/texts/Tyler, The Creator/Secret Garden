[Verse 1]
STRESS and it's permanently with me like it's tatted on my chest
It's enough to make another nigga feel depressed
You can see I'm not effected cause I'm far from the rest
And all I wanna do is make music
Get a beat, perceive to writing and lose it
My thoughts [?] you can tell my mind's [?]
Head's in the cloud with no weed to do it with
And all these other rappers need drugs
And all I need is get earplugs
Watching lames in the game, they push and shove
Showing hip-hop no love, rapping about hoes and slugs
So who is there to fucking judge
I'm sitting high here with no one above
Oh my bad, let me pardon
I would like to welcome you to our secret garden

[Hook]
The only way that you could see is if you listen
Our lyrics take you to a whole other dimension
To a place where you can't just walk in
It's in our minds, we call it secret garden
The only way that you could see is if you listen
Our lyrics take you to a whole other dimension
To a place where you can't just walk in
It's in our minds, we call it secret garden

[Verse 2]
Welcome to our secret garden, may I help you
It's a privilege because I help very few
But I do it for hip-hop in which I'm married to
Besides this aerials and varials, shit
This track sicker than [?] for shit
We milk it, similar to what dairies do
Hold up, wait brother, just listen
And stop being sensitive to these words that I'm spitting
I keep going, no need for intermission
I seek a better path, I rely on my
My vision I rely on
So I keep my eye on cause the switch broke
Then I think about it what I need a switch for
Cause I got three other senses
My pen, my pad, and my pencil
Express myself
That's what the secret garden's here for

[Hook]
The only way that you could see is if you listen
Our lyrics take you to a whole other dimension
To a place where you can't just walk in
It's in our minds, we call it secret garden
The only way that you could see is if you listen
Our lyrics take you to a whole other dimension
To a place where you can't just walk in
It's in our minds, we call it secret garden

[Verse 3]
Let's take a walk through the garden
[?]
But you never know what I'm working up in the garden
When I stand up, everybody stand up
All eyes on me, Weezy baby sarg
And forget [?] reaching for the stars
Sooner or later I'ma be one
Never packed a pistol because I don't need one
If you come between me and money [?]
Cause when it come to Ben and Ben Franks, I'm gon' kill for 'em
Slow it up, bring it back for 'em
I'm not the king of the south but
Each and every time I open my mouth
I spit fire, that hot shit that I release
And yes, I don't wanna get high
Cause I'm great on that sober cloud, heavier than cloud 8
Lyric [?]
Answer this, you straight or is you straight gay
Now listen man
I ain't [?]
Flip the subject
Now let's talk about girls that's missing, me
They open up their heart and like a new key, I'm in there
You like a puddle of water, you just sitting there
Get pretty hectic in my garden
I beg your pardon, just listen sir
I would like to welcome you to my secret garden
