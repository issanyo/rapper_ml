[Chorus: brandUn DeShay]
If I want it, you got it, then I'ma get it, get it
If you ain't hip to relate, best to get with it, with it
They think I'm lost, but they really don't know
I'm on my way to the bank (L-M-A-O)
If I want it, you got it, then I'ma get it, get it
If you ain't hip to relate, best to get with it, with it
They think I'm lost, but they really don't know
I'm on my way to the bank (L-M-A-O)

[Verse 1: brandUn DeShay]
They say actions speak louder than words, they don't hear me, though
That's why I won't be happy 'til I'm like stereo
Everywhere he go, they be like, ''There he go!''
BrandUn DeShay on the mic, so here we go
No time for the losers, we all-stars
And ain't nobody on the bench, dog, we all start
About as peaceful as a hippie, but I'll spark
I'm serious, dog, I'm in my prime like the Allspark
And where'd they show y'all get y'all videos, Cost Mart?
Them girls sitting on the grill like a Ballpark
A bunch of niggas in packs like baseball cards
Tricked out cars trying to ball in front of Walmart
I'm sorry, I'm just not an acronym-o
Killing tracks in a Fascist fashion, that's my M.O
Fly like the interceptor [?]
Deny it like the interception you hear in N.O

[Chorus: brandUn DeShay]
If I want it, you got it, then I'ma get it, get it
If you ain't hip to relate, best to get with it, with it
They think I'm lost, but they really don't know
I'm on my way to the bank (L-M-A-O)
If I want it, you got it, then I'ma get it, get it
If you ain't hip to relate, best to get with it, with it
They think I'm lost, but they really don't know
I'm on my way to the bank (L-M-A-O)

[Verse 2: brandUn DeShay]
Right now, I ain't ish, but I'll be the ish
So though I ate ish, you'll still eat ish
You're soon, so be quick, don't eat turds
Instead, eat your own words like hors d'oevres
Get it? Yes sir, I'm the best man like your best friend
I'm in the air like kegstand
Grounded like kickstand, no bull like S there
I'm a beast like the blue X-Men
Check your claim if you claim it
I murdered the beat with no stainless
Shoot, I just hopped on the track, I'm so aimless
Haters try to pay me no mind, they're so brainless
Dangerous wack rhymers, that five, seven, eight, nine, and teenagers, space rhymers
Showtime the headliner, flow speed redliner
The old soul crate digging like the gold miner
New jack, coolest cat you've seen since the snow tiger

[Chorus: brandUn DeShay]
If I want it, you got it, then I'ma get it, get it
If you ain't hip to relate, best to get with it, with it
They think I'm lost, but they really don't know
I'm on my way to the bank (L-M-A-O)
If I want it, you got it, then I'ma get it, get it
If you ain't hip to relate, best to get with it, with it
They think I'm lost, but they really don't know
I'm on my way to the bank (L-M-A-O)

[Verse 3: Tyler, The Creator]
B, what's happening? Nigga fuck rapping
I'm in cell 1 and 2 because I'm considering trapping
3 or 4 with some overweight groupies
And a food stamp nigga and a motherfucking hoopdy
But truthfully, I'm hungry, these rappers is lunchmeat
I laugh at AIDS victims, cold heart, fuck heat
Fuck school, do drugs, holes with no magnum, kill everyone in the industry
And drag them to the florist by the end of the chorus, so they can be alive in case
My fucking verse is boring, bass in the stairs
Stock shit like a share, I'm a virus
Having great dreams of fucking Miley Cyrus
Bitches, I bag them, jeans, I sag them
7, 8, y'all don't lay them straight, your nigga is fag them
9, 10, I'm a motherfucking sin
Turn this shit off before I say... Amen

[Chorus: brandUn DeShay]
If I want it, you got it, then I'ma get it, get it
If you ain't hip to relate, best to get with it, with it
They think I'm lost, but they really don't know
I'm on my way to the bank (L-M-A-O)
If I want it, you got it, then I'ma get it, get it
If you ain't hip to relate, best to get with it, with it
They think I'm lost, but they really don't know
I'm on my way to the bank (L-M-A-O)

[Outro: brandUn DeShay (Tyler, The Creator)]
BrandUn DeShay
Tyler, The Creator
16-Bit meets Odd Future (yep)
I mean, we really gotta stop meeting like this, Ty
(I got you, my nigga)
It's not even fair to the world
(Come on, man, we just made a classic)
From now until forever
(Forever)
