[Chorus: Fuzz Scoota]
Trife thieves, we can't be trusted
Steppin' to my clique the wrong way and get yo' motherfuckin' dome busted
We got cement shoes for all you damn snitches
We ain't just shootin' niggas, we fuckin' bitches
Trife thieves, we can't be trusted
Steppin' to my clique the wrong way and get yo' motherfuckin' dome busted
We got cement shoes for all you damn snitches
We ain't just shootin' niggas, we fuckin' bitches

[Verse 1: Bizarre]
My fully loaded nine will shoot through your metal door
Have ya nigga's far and out like white kids at grocery stores (AHHHH!)
Battle Bizarre and it's just too deadly
Even a rapper with amnesia who met me still couldn't forget me
If I don't get all my fuckin' dough
Y'all gon' see more fights and spits than the Jerry Springer show
'Cause I'm a nasty, dirty, filthy bitch
For ten rocks even a basshead with AIDS would suck my dick
'Cause I'm quick to snatch a nigga out his Polo
I'm the reason niggas come ten deep and end up leavin' solo
(I'm by myself!) Me losin'? Y'all niggas must be buggin
We can battle for ten minutes and let your cousins be the judges
I'm the illest rapper to come out thus far
I'll shoot anybody; even the bitch who gave me CPR
Step to the Outz' and end up getting burned
Fuck around and get raped like one of Bill Clinton's interns

[Verse 2: Eminem]
I'll shove a gun in ya grill, greasy and heated
Smothered in hot mustard, so when I feed it to you it's easy to eat it (eat this)
You need to be immediately treated
While you breathin' and you'll be leavin' the receivin' room this evenin' with Jesus
You hate on us and we'll be waitin' on eight corners
Swarmin' ya hood with a thousand angry skateboarders (c'mon)
I hop in a Jeep, slam on the gas and charge you
And bombard you in the car that your mom bought you
Fuck around and get choked and found in a moat
Floatin' around drowned, face down in a boat (damn)
I'll pile five dudes in a Pinto and pull up
To the 7 Mile drive-through at McDonald's and pile-drive you
I got the power to snatch a motherfucker out of his car
When he rides by me at ninety miles an hour
This place is my house, I might as well erase my face
With white out, 'cause y'all can't see me like Mase's eyebrows

[Verse 3: Fuzz Scoota]
I'm dressed to please sucking nips
Yeah, she get it the same way that I fucked the chick
Stuck my hands in her panties like bitch suck my dick
87 freak 187 heat the passion rolls I'm passin' clothes
You like it in the ass is what I'm askin' hoes
Aren't you Fuzz he has sold more albums then the Jacksons sold
I love you baby if I'm not with you then I'm blastin' foes
Telepathically harrasing foes
I know your little sister is fourteen but her ass can grow
Ice-berg took down Titanic elastical
Given my fans the exact shit they askin' fo'
Fuzz Scooter fucking one man bout to show
You passing one blunt bitch we passing four
I rode your ass and smoked take one pull and smoke your head up
I'll send you to tell 2Pac to keep his head up
I went to the fighting really Canibus who can get up
I knew this shit was over from the fucking blood that he spit up
Ran a couple more miles should have done more sit-ups
I want his dumb ass to jump up bitch and get lit up
Call your bitch like, "Bitch, come and pick this bitch up"
On battle you be sweeter then I get this shit up
I'll stomp you too you get up
Or stomp you to the cops come
Eighty nigga's came when your fucking block got dumb

[Chorus: Fuzz Scoota]
