[Verse 1: Dandyguel]

[Verse 2: Tuan X]
I said, put me on a track wit' Nas & them, fuck it
Put me on a track wit' Jay & Em. My name is Tuan
Say it like the numbers bitches 2-1
Bred in The Stuy, Brooklyn 'til I dizzie
Ain't for the punch-line rhymes, I ain't got the tizzime
I hit you wit' that real shit, kop it for a dizzime
I hit you wit' that hood shit, umbrella in the rain flow
Where if you go to prison pretty, come out wearin' a rainbow
Now how that saying go? "Ain't No Love"
We in the heart of the matter lookin' for gram green
Searching for God in a blunt, diggin' for love in a cunt
And all we get is this ditch & a triflin' bitch
My 1st love was a whore, knew I was God when I saw
My boy die, my mom cry, failing to die 3 times
Three lives, now I'm livin' on my last
My future's goin' right & what's left is in the past
See, I told my grandma I'm stayin' off that crime shit
I told my cousin, "When you write make sure it's life shit."
My life's a feature film, music's my cinema,
You are the audience, now here's a preview
There will be no sequel no prequel
It's a one time affair, weave in ya best hair
Put on ya best Airs and wear ya best ears
Now listen, listen here. Mr. X shall be here
Forever long, however long forever long can be
Spit heaven on and hell upon these heroinic beats
Now get up on him, feel up on her, feel a boner.. beat
Now marijuana, legalize it, I don't smoke, I preach
Life's a beach & I'm the best swimmer
And talking to my women, you are the best dinner
And I am so sinner, but I don't believe in hell
If life is fresh water, my mind is the well
