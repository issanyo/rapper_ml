Verse 1:
Hu’ROS, rap slayer
Half way out the ass crater
Nah, I’m playing
New Innovator, in a way a rap savior
Spit fire might just light the city, disintegrating
Every hater I ever came in contact with, later
You can jump in if it’s Lit (Hey)
I just name dropped my shit (yeah)
That’s the girl you with (mmm)
But she wants my...
Pardon this, I often spit
A bunch of rhymes out of line like I’m morphing it
I’m a narcissist far from this o
Obviously horror rich coffin you all are in
Earth, I’m an alien, an E.T
Extra terrific, everyone’s target, endless pardons can miss me
Cause I’m not sorry, you Barbie
You can drive your car directly into the lavatory
So I can shit on you

Hook:
I don't care who you are
I'll shit on you!
Don't give a fuck about you or your car
I'll shit on you!
Fuck your house, fuck your jewelry and your watch
I'll shit on you!
Fuck your wife, fuck your kids, fuck your family

Verse 2:
What the fuck is he on about
He ain’t got a hit, but sure knows how to run his mouth
Thinking he killing these beats, like he could gun them down
We need to get him to speak, so we can lock him now
Behind his bars, he’ll never come out
Ha, there several routes
Won’t rest till I’m out
Then get to your house
Your potential spouse
I’ll get her wetter than river
Get her so aroused
Till you step in and drown
Matter fact, bitch, suck a nigga dick for some Truckfit
I ain’t got none, but please it’s been a minute since I busted
And no nut November got a nigga feeling love sick, fuck this
I need to get drunk just to function
Slur my words, punch in her numbers
Wake her from her slumber, say fuck her, I’m monster
Hiding under beds, hiding under covers
Hide your lovers I’m a robber disguised as rubber
Real feel though
Fuck it, a dildo
I’m still so ill
I be coughing up kill flows
What’s your deal though, for real hoe
Fucking ugly blessers to get some green like Cee Lo
Who said that, must be half a man
Well look at me, I robot, or the man of steel, know
I’m the fresh prince, but I will smith it 'til I am legend
I’m dead shot my head shots freeze foes
Keep these hoes, weak in the knees, so
Smooth how I creep in like the cool sea breeze, cold-
Hearted, could never make her my bae
And I got a new tape on the way
So prepare all of the hate
So I can shit on you

Hook:
I don't care who you are
I'll shit on you!
Don't give a fuck about you or your car
I'll shit on you!
Fuck your house, fuck your jewelry and your watch
I'll shit on you!
Fuck your wife, fuck your kids, fuck your family
