[INTRO: YAMI]
Dan Green
Real name, no gimmicks! -(*record scratch*)

Two Dark Magician Girls go round the outside
Round the outside
Round the outside
Two Dark Magician Girls go round the outside
Round the outside
Round the outside

[Maximillion Pegasus]

[Bakura] Guess who's back!
[Marik] Guess who's back!

[Announcer Guy] Guess who's back!
[Bandit Keith] Guess who's back!
In America!

[VERSE 1: YUGI]
I've summoned a monster!
Cuz nobody wants to see Yugi no more
They want Yami, I'm chopped liver!
Well if you want Yami this is what I'll give ya
A little bit of yaoi fanart of Yami Bakura
Some card games that drag on and on duller
Than the crap on those poor saps' TeamFourStar's channel
Or the gasps in their fanbase when they lose a rating
Or the gaps in their schedule when they're not updating! (HEY!)
You waited this long, now stop debating
Cause I'm back, it's time to duel, and cards need trading
You may think the dubs are mistranslating
But the guys who fansub are masturbating
So 4KidsTV won't let me be
Or let me be me
So let me see
They tried to switch me out with Dragonball Z
But it feels so empty without me so
Yu-Gi-Oh Abridged burned like a bridge
Got banned, you worried a smidge and raided the fridge
But don't panic, cause this s**t's about to get manic
I just shuffled all my trading cards, F*** YOU MARIK!

[HOOK]
Now this looks like a job for me
So everybody just follow me
Cause we need a little controversy
Cause it feels so empty without me
I said this looks like a job for me
So everybody just follow me
Cause we need a little controversy
Cause it feels so empty without me

[VERSE 2: YUGI]
LittleKuriboh; the guy who watches Yu-Gi-Oh
Embarrassed his parents don't listen to Devo
He starts crying at Finding Nemo
Then he makes a lameo video and everyone yells WHOA!
A visionary, his fangirls are scary
A YouTube revolution, otakus are wary
A rebel, so lemme just revel and boast
In the fact that I got everyone stealing my jokes
And it's a low-blow, such a cacophony
For you to steal so damn much from my show, don't copy me!
Well I'm back, na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na
We got screwed by Revver, blew the budget now we're gonna
Begin again, start from scratch and completely
Regain all our subscribers, update the show weekly
No protesting, just like you're all requesting
With all the quotes HeavyDDR's detesting
(Testing! Attention Duelists!)
Feel the tension soon as someone mentions me
Lanipator claims I have animosity
You know what I think? "Who the hell is he?!"

[HOOK]
Now this looks like a job for me
So everybody just follow me
Cause we need a little controversy
Cause it feels so empty without me
I said this looks like a job for me
So everybody just follow me
Cause we need a little controversy
Cause it feels so empty without me


[VERSE 3:]
Abridge this Abridge that, it's become the new fad
It's a shame that most of the results turn out so bad
Yo Sephirex, quit makin' fun of GX
It's better than most of your video train wrecks
And Kaiser, man, you're none the wiser
Your series is about as funny as Rob schneider
Vegeta and Masako, you guys should just let go, it's over
Nobody watches Naruto
Now farewell
Go abridge some Zatch Bell!
Or post on your blog while listening to Soft Cell
This show's been greater than Ghost In The Shell
Ever since CurtDogg turned it into a nutshell
But sometimes it's all the same
Everybody only wants to call us lame
So this must mean LK's to blame
Cause it's not me, I'm king of games
And while he's not the first one to fandub Yugi
He is the first one that's not a newbie
To make the show seem kinda funny
Though it doesn't make him any money
(HEY!)
There's a concept that's broke!
Twenty million other users steal his jokes
But no matter how many imitate LK
It won't change the fact that he's here to stay


[HOOK]
Now this looks like a job for me
So everybody just follow me
Cause we need a little controversy
Cause it feels so empty without me
I said this looks like a job for me
So everybody just follow me
Cause we need a little controversy
Cause it feels so empty without me
