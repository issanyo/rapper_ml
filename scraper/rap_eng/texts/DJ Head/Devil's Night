[Verse 1: Eminem]
I make music to make you sick of fake music
Hate music like devil-worshipping Satan music
So say your prayers, your 'Hail Mary's and Jesuses
Take two sticks, tape 'em together and make a crucifix
Try to stop it but you can't do it
A whole generation of kids blowing out their fucking brains to this
Kurt Cobain music. Students converted to 'caine users
As soon as they heard it went out and murdered and maimed to it
What's your name?

[Verse 2: Swifty McVay]
Judas
Got my nine with six sharpshooters, now let's do this
I got niggas that shoots to static. You don't understand
How I'm all up in you niggas' TVs like Carole Anne
I'm a poltergeist: lyrically, I'm supposed to strike
Try to snatch this mic, you get cracked with Molson Ice
(Swifty get your own woman!) I want his wife
I'm the type to go to gamblin' parties with trick dice
I rob casinos. Slugs, eat those
You'd think it was the devil feedin' you jalapenos
Now you out of the scene hoes shot at your clean clothes
My fo'-fo', prone to make you niggas breathe wrong

[Hook: Eminem] [x2]
It's Devil's Night, it's Devil's Night [x2]
Cause I came back to rule this time
Cause I came back to take what's mine

[Verse 3: Kon Artis]
It's like I'm on the john, trying to shit and get no response
Constipated, bitch; tell these pigs to back off
The mind of a rapist, Denaun never changes
Beat up strangers without a reason; I'm a anus
Walk the street in a "Beat It" jacket with a glove to match it
Drop the hat shit; I put my head on opposite and step backwards
A walking zombie that's ornery
Pulling armed robberies on politicians without a sense of camaraderie

[Verse 4: Kuniva]
I can concoct the nine slot, plus I run with the best
Hop on a motorcycle, busting wheelies over your chest
Bystanders standing by, thinking 'oh, what a mess'
Blast through every hickie that them bitches put on your neck
What the fuck do you expect, when the slugs get dealt
And make you feel every ounce of pain that Bugz had felt
A deranged team, smoking ganja greens
This carbine'll make your fucking head shake like tambourines
I pledge allegiance to the streets of the D
And if you think you out cold, catch a piece of this heat
And when it blast, it'll take off every piece of your [niece]
From her barettes to her cheeks to her cute little feet

[Hook]

[Verse 5: Bizarre]
(Stop taking drugs!) I'm trying
My little boy is dying, he losing too much iron
And if I die, it won't be because I got shot:
It'll be because I tied my arm in a sock and smoked rock
Taking drugs is cool, that's why I buy 'em
Shoot 'em up my ass; let your little brother try 'em
Ten years is what I'm facing
Police breakin' in my house, Lil' Bow Wow in the basement (Jermaine!)
A rapist that'll bust in your mouth
I'll probably be in jail 'fore this fucking album comes out
I'm eighteen years old, still shitting the bed
Beaten 'til I'm red; fed nothing but water and bread
It's me again, fucking dirty jinn
So what if it burns, bitch, when I stick it in?
No medication; I'm out of Percocet
I lost my weed plus my fucking diaper's wet

[Hook]
