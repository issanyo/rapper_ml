[Verse 1]
How do you think our lives would've been
If we left our hope at South Side, telling me?
But what about the fields that we both used to see
I shouldn't let my emotions take control on me

[Chorus]
Your kiss
I remember how it came to be
Your kiss
I wish you weren't so far away from me
Your kiss
I felt so trapped and sat me free
Your kiss
Is all I ever won't forget

[Verse 2]
How much do you think my heart can endure?
Your mind games and all your tricks, can't be sure
But when will be the right time to say goodbye
Leave the memories and your kiss far away behind

[Chorus]
Your kiss
I remember how it came to be
Your kiss
I wish you weren't so far away from me
Your kiss
I felt so trapped and sat me free
Your kiss
Is all I ever won't forget
