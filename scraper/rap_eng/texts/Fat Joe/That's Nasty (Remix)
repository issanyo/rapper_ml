[Intro: Lil'Jon]
What, What, Oh let's go!! (It's the nasty beatmakers!)
Reeeemix, Yeah!
Pitbull and it's bitch... Me!
It's suburban Joe chekin' in, Scrabby
All my chicos there (Fat Joe!)
Let's go!

[Hook: Scrabby & Lil'Jon] (x4)
When i hit mami you know nasty (That's nasty)

[Verse 1]
Pitbull and Joe crack on the same track, that's a problem
We'll get more money than rich poor in "asi" get in Harlem
Rob from the rich, give to the poor, welcome to the bottom
Where the cocaine in the old school chevy game is more than hobby
I'm tellin you this boys down here'r very heavy mayn
The're "out of pit study sex ous" but really is a number game
A 2 point 2 thang
But look what happen
