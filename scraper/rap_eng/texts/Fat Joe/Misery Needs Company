Intro: [police sirens]

[Noreaga] and (Fat Joe) talking
[Yo, Crack man, niggas just got word from the penal, god]
(What the deal Nore, got word from the penal? How niggas doin'?)
[Niggas sayin'... niggas sayin' that they shittin' on your name and shit, yo]
(Shit - shittin' on my name? Fuck they talkin' about?)
[Snitchin' and shit like that]
(Nah, that must be some nondescript niggas, not nobody I run wit'?)
[Word is bond, they said niggas you used ta... break bread with, god]
(Yo, fuck them niggas, word to mother!)

[Fat Joe]

Yo, yo, one's for the cash, two's for my faculty
Three's for all the M-3's
Racin across the Tappan Zee
?Matchin C's? followed by the white Lincoln
Drivin like I ain't thinkin
Wit my hazard lights blinkin, let the lah sink in
On the way to home BASE
First clown in my face is gettin thrown out the place
We run shit, untouchable Don shit, that's nothin new
Sets with stone arms just to muscle you, enough of you
That had a bad case of Joe, some even had to go
Gangsta walk and nines, at times I be the last to know
We laugh and joke, while we baggin the coke
My yay done make the worst things out the cast of Different Strokes
I'm addicted to street life, although it doesn't seem right
Many criticize but yo we all go to eat right?
And who's to say that I'm to blame(blame)
We only pawns in this game(game)
The streets don't grow cocaine
I don't want no cure for this, you switch, I pour the Cris
And just, stay rich, and reminisce, while I count my chips

Chorus

[Noreaga]

Yo you scared to death, misery need company
These crab slackers, niggas actin like they mad rappers
Even wit a record deal, our guns still peal
Break a piece of your brain off, wipe the stain off
Throw the Range off, police-iano
Watch for hondo, they lookin at our poster now, playin us closer now
The funds follow us, what, these bitches swallow us
And you wonder why you can't find us

[Fat Joe]

Attended dinner wit millionaires, gave a million stares
Made a million scared, my peops was locked
For what seemed like a million years, yea
This illegal life I can't avoid, I take the feds everywhere I go
That's why I'm paranoid, but still I choose to ignore the fact
I got the flawless Acs wit gats to get that enormous stack
Joey Crack, the Mack without the hat
And all our hoes that'll ride in the back seat of my Cadillac
I bet you hate it cuz we paid and floss, nigga we laid and lost
T.S.'ll make the baddest crews take a loss
Break your balls like Bahondo, call me Don Joe
Coke slash ready rock, niggas drop a dime dough
Booked the nine o'clock, flight to Alando
So-called killers turned snitches like Gravano
That nigga Gauno up in M-C, is bein' friendly
Everytime I see his wife and kids the shit tempts me
My heart is empty, never feelin remorse
I got a sniper one building a cross ready to kill your boss

Chorus

[Noreaga]

Yo, yo Jose Luis, smoke lah like the reverend
Look in the skies, clouds look like coke 'n heaven
Like whoever sittin' on pies too, gettin' high too
Mad fly too, a thug too
Yo we praise those, however you make your pesos
Keep your shit tight just like, Jose Canseco's
Batting stance, a majorly we glance
And gotta yell "What, What!"
Cuz thug niggas don't dance yo
I told niggas, that you did it for show
But niggas thought you was ill, yo
Even your ho, yo for real youngblood I'm really afraid so
Your colors got revealed and now you buy dough
Impost-o's, locos, morenos, go-golos, boriquas, Latinos
My niggas rollin those, fontos and hydros
You know how that goes, DE's light it up though
We stay smokin it, Tone Loc'in it
Me and Fat Joe still provoking it

Chorus

(ha ha, mad rappers, stain off, range off, watch out
Polic-iano's, pabolos
Amigos...Fat Joe, Fat Joe, Fat Joe, yea yea)
