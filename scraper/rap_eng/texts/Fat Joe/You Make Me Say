[Verse 1: Donell Jones]
You don't even know me (know me)
But I been watchin' you for a while
The way you move so slowly
Makes me want you here and now
Shorty don't you let me leave without your number (without your number)
I was hoping that your love could take me under whoaa

[Bridge:]
Baby we can move just a little, groove just a little
Two step a little bit
Make you body move in the middle
If you choose just a little
Maybe I can get a little kiss

[Chorus:]
Cause you make me say
I-e i-e i-e i-e i (ooo you make me say)
I-e i-e i-e i-e i (girl you make me say)
I-e i-e i-e i-e i (ooo you make me say)
I-e i-e i-e i-e i (I wish I could be your guy)

[Verse 2: Donell Jones]
I see the way you movin' (movin)
And I wanna talk to you
Look at what your doin'
Can I take a walk with you?
Baby I don't wanna leave without your number (without your number)
And girl I wanna spend some time with you this summer ohhhhh

[Bridge:]
Baby we can move just a little, groove just a little
Two step a little bit
Make you body move in the middle
If you choose just a little
Maybe I can get a little kiss

[Chorus:]
Cause you make me say
I-e i-e i-e i-e i (ooo you make me say)
