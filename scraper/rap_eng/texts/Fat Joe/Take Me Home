[Chorus: Dre]
She wanna take me home and lay me up inside her home
She wanna turn me on, breakfast in the morning
She said, "Daddy let me take ya home
Papi let me take ya home"
And I said, "Mami you can take me home
If you let the whole crew get on" (bitch)

[Verse 1: Fat Joe]
I got this chick from Cali, profilin', she's wylin'
She's gangsta, she knows that she's got it like that
We was drivin' on Crenshaw and cruisin' for food when
She pulled up beside me sat off in a 'Lac
And I said "Damn girl you actin' like you don't know never seen me before
Episode of cribs on MTV video, what you think TS stand for?"
She said "Terrific Sex", yeah that's who and the diamonds is no facade
Used to be a broke nigga from the BX
Now I'm rich got the world screamin' Terror Squad
Think about it now, everywhere we go
Every other city we tour, they never say no
Seems like every other night I got a different chick beggin' me...

[Chorus: Dre]
She wanna take me home and lay me up inside her home
She wanna turn me on, breakfast in the morning
She said, "Daddy let me take ya home
Papi let me take ya home"
And I said, "Mami you can take me home
If you let the whole crew get on"

[Verse 2: Remy Ma]
I was up in the club right had some Remy in my cup right
And that's when I peeped him, he was lookin' so fresh and so cleaned up
From the fitted down to his sneakers
I really do mean this I ain't never seen this, there
Was some people standin' in between us
I had to go over there so I could meet him I had him
Pimped up in the cut near the speakers
If he got a girl I know she's heated 'cause right now I'm all he needin'
If he, crush me then trust me it's a guarantee that he's not leavin'
Told me he heard of me but don't know me and I liked him for some reason
Invited him to my place, sat on his face and I ain't got a man so it ain't cheatin'
Think about it now, I don't gotta stress
I don't never really gotta press, they always say yes
It seems like every other night I got a different nigga beggin' me...

[Chorus: Dre]
She wanna take me home and lay me up inside her home
She wanna turn me on, breakfast in the morning
She said, "Daddy let me take ya home
Papi let me take ya home"
And I said, "Mami you can take me home
If you let the whole crew get on"

[Verse 3: Armageddon]
You's a big girl, eat it up
Now tell ya friend to hold your hair while you eatin' up
A little hot, little drunk, little weeded up
We in the truck and freakin' off while the speakers bump
I'm steady speedin' up swervin' the bumps
I'm tryna fuck, but I ain't tryna fuck the 23's up
So I ease up, drunk and focused
Tryna watch the road but yo the back seats heatin' up
And so I'm keepin' them, wish you could see them
I know you hear them breathin' like you been possessed by a demon
I know you heated, wish you was here but, gotta go now have a good evening
Hang up the phone now, have a good weekend
Shorty just called the boat the front seat
And I think she's about to go down for a season
I know the horn ain't beep for no reason
3 in the morning and actin indecent
She so horny damn this shit seems like every other night
I got a group of chicks beggin' me...

[Chorus: Dre]
She wanna take me home and lay me up inside her home
She wanna turn me on, breakfast in the morning
She said, "Daddy let me take ya home
Papi let me take ya home"
And I said, "Mami you can take me home
If you let the whole crew get on"
She wanna take me home and lay me up inside her home
She wanna turn me on, breakfast in the morning
She said, "Daddy let me take ya home
Papi let me take ya home"
And I said, "Mami you can take me home
If you let the whole crew get on"
