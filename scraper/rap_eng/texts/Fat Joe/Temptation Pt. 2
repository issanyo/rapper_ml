[27 second skit opens song telling Pablo his sister is dead]

[Chorus: 'Pablo']
Joe Crack's that nigga
I'll clap that nigga, hold THAT lil' nigga
I'm from the, BX borough, you ain't promise tomorrow
If you know like I know
You load ya clips up with them hollows, sayin'

[Verse 1: Fat Joe]
Raindrops are fallin' on my hood again, hood again
Niggas is talkin' in the hood again, hood again
Yeah, niggas wanna act live
I got that 9 that kill more than just time
They say they can't stand him
But just yesterday I was chillin' on the block in the Phantom
And ain't nobody smirk my way
Nope, keep speakin' that hot shit, and you can get merked today
Check me out, there's some rumblin' on the blocks
Struggle on the streets
That's why I had to leave that bitch bloody in them sheets
Go 'head and think Crack just rap
Fuck around I'm gon' really have to clap these cats
I hear 'em talkin' that

[Chorus: 'Pablo']
Joe Crack's that nigga
I'll clap that nigga, hold THAT lil' nigga
I'm from the, BX borough, you ain't promise tomorrow
If you know like I know
You load ya clips up with them hollows, sayin'

[Post-Chorus: Fat Joe]
If I don't know you boy I'm lettin' 'em go
I tried to tell you boy I'm lettin' 'em go
Your momma warned you boy that I ain't no joke
I tried to tell you boy I'm lettin' 'em go
If I don't know you boy I'm lettin' 'em go
I tried to tell you boy I'm lettin' 'em go
Your momma warned you boy that I ain't no joke
I'm tired of talkin' boy I'm lettin' 'em go

[Verse 2: 'Pablo']
Yeah, does Crack think he live
Just because he had poppin' in '88 and his boys served time?
I don't care 'bout that neither
I don't give a fuck about him, T.S. or the fever
Yeah I said it, when I see him I'ma pop him
I know he big, but this here 9 gon' stop him
I'm in the streets everyday in these projects
I ain't scared, nigga, man I'm dyin' to get it poppin'

[Chorus: 'Pablo']
Joe Crack's that nigga
I'll clap that nigga, hold THAT lil' nigga
I'm from the, BX borough, you ain't promise tomorrow
If you know like I know
You load ya clips up with them hollows, sayin'

[Post-Chorus: Fat Joe]
If I don't know you boy I'm lettin' 'em go
I tried to tell you boy I'm lettin' 'em go
Your momma warned you boy that I ain't no joke
I tried to tell you boy I'm lettin' 'em go
If I don't know you boy I'm lettin' 'em go
I tried to tell you boy I'm lettin' 'em go
Your momma warned you boy that I ain't no joke
I'm tired of talkin' boy I'm lettin' 'em go

[Verse 3: Fat Joe]
Pussies loose these days, gotta tighten 'em up
Think they comin' of age 'til you lighten 'em up
Momma screamin' cause you lyin' in dust, I ain't lyin'
Who the fuck you think supplyin' the drugs?
I'm your boss's boss, pretty much I bought you that Porsche
And pretty much, I'm 'bout to auction you off
To the highest clapper
Get your head spun backwards you bastards
For thinkin' Terror Squad just rappers, we'll blast ya
You lil' niggas ain't even in my lane
Who you know nicknamed after 'caine?
Yeah I'm goin' to hell, but I'm sendin' you first
Muh'fuckers think they tough 'til them cannons disperse
I know you hear me niggas

[Chorus: Fat Joe]
Joe Crack's that nigga
I'll clap that nigga, hold THAT lil' nigga
I'm from the, BX borough, you ain't promise tomorrow
If you know like I know
You'll load them clips up with them hollows, and

[Post-Chorus: Fat Joe]
If I don't know you boy I'm lettin' 'em go
I tried to tell you boy I'm lettin' 'em go
Your momma warned you boy that I ain't no joke
I tried to tell you boy I'm lettin' 'em go
If I don't know you boy I'm lettin' 'em go
I tried to tell you boy I'm lettin' 'em go
Your momma warned you boy that I ain't no joke
I'm tired of talkin' boy I'm lettin' 'em go
