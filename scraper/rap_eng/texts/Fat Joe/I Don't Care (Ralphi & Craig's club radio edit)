Yeah
Crack
I don't care, that's what Ricky says

I don't care
I just wanna be yours
I know I told you I'd never love you the way that I did again after all that you did to me
But I got to say

I don't care
I just wanna be yours
And I tried everything in my power to never ever say
"please come back to me"
But I got to say

You promised me would always be you'd never let me go
You took the ring and all the things that came with being my girl
The tragedy as I walked through that door
He had your feet up over the seat
All I heard was screaming

It was like a movie, too real to me, that just can't be my bride to be. NO
I was shocked this could be, never thinking one day I'd take this BLOW BLOW BLOW
I was starting to feel like I should kill everything that was moving. WHOA
I've never been in hell like this
Somebody wake me up!

I don't care
I just wanna be yours
I know I told you I'd never love you the way that I did again after all that you did to me
But I got to say

I don't care
I just wanna be yours
And I tried everything in my power to never ever say "please come back to me"
But I got to say

The crazy part was that he just kept going cause she was the only one that had noticed me
Staring into the eyes that I will one day call my baby
How could I have fallen so in love with someone I've known for years
And not even know that she'd be the one to reveal my worst fears

It was like a movie, too real to me, that just can't be my bride to be. NO
I was shocked this could be, never thinking one day I'd take this BLOW BLOW BLOW
I was starting to feel like I should kill everything that was moving. WHOA
I've never been in hell like this
Somebody wake me up!

I don't care
I just wanna be yours
I know I told you I'd never love you the way that I did again after all that you did to me
But I got to say

I don't care
I just wanna be yours
And I tried everything in my power to never ever say "please come back to me"
But I got to say

I didn't mean to do all those things to you
Tell me what to do to make it up to you
I'll do everything, anything you want me to

I didn't mean to do all those things to you
Tell me what to do to make it up to you
I'll do everything, anything you want me to

Should I leave, should I go, should I break apart / My Mama said you would break my heart
I can't believe you a sleaze, you a slut, a ho, now you wanna have a change of heart
Damn
Who would have thought that you would have deceived me, love of my life, you my queen like Eve
And you didn't even tell me you leavin', I had to hear about it on a scandal on TV
Now who this man creapin' in the back door, 'bout to hit him with the FO FO FO
I know you keep sayin' that you lovin' me so, but why the hell you crushin' him for
God damn now
I don't care, that's what Ricky says, and if I catch him then this kid be dead
I don't play that Mami
Now back to the jets you go, I left your Reeboks by the front door
Get rocks

I don't care
I just wanna be yours
I know I told you I'd never love you the way that I did again after all that you did to me
But I got to say

I don't care
I just wanna be yours
And I tried everything in my power to never ever say "please come back to me"
But I got to say

Sorry baby
I didn't mean to hurt you

I don't care
That's what Ricky says
