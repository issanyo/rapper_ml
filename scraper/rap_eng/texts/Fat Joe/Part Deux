How many emcees must get dissed?
How many motherfuckin mics I got to rip? Til you
Are considerate, illegitimate, rap motherfuckers
Stop talkin your shit!! Yeah
Fat Joe, Jealous One's Envy
Steppin to the jam niggas actin all friendly
Smilin in my face, and all the whiles they wanna
Take my fuckin place, them backstabbers, them backstabbers
I got some shit for your whole damn crew
How the fuck you gon' face a Mac-11 with a twenty-two?
And then deliver, I'll shake your shiver
And shatter your bones, the modern day Al Capone
Step into my zone and get blown
He who claims to wear the crown'll get the throne, check it
There's many emcees in this world of rap
But not too many emcees can fuck with Joey Crack
In fact, yo, I be the realest you know
With the illest of flows, bustin caps at po-po's

Chorus:

"You gotta flow Joe!" All these niggas know the time
When I come through I shine with these genuine rhymes
"Let em know Joe!" What you mean they don't know?
I'm representin right now like I represented befo'
"You gotta flow Joe!" All these niggas know the time
When I come through I shine with these genuine rhymes
"Let em know Joe!" What you mean they don't know?
What you mean they don't know? What you mean they don't know?

Many thought it couldn't happen, Joe was never rappin
He was always gettin loot off the crack and
Fuckin with them heavyweights, who had shit sewn in every state
The very sight'll make the average man defecate
Livin the life of stock, bonds and cars, word bond
When I be gone I'll be worshipped like Nicky Barnes
It's on, you don't want no confrontation
Killer communication, I suffer from multiple lacerations
Take a look at Joey Gambino
Spilled your chips in the casinos while feastin on shrimp scallapino
Niggas don't want it, word to mother
I be that catchin body ese that'll leave that ass six feet under
Rappers wonder, where I been since _The Real_
I been plannin my strategy for the next kill
Ninety-five for the real live
Only the strong survive, that's why I pack a four-five
We got, all these actors playin characters and killers
Wannabe hammer cockers, but, shit is realer than they think
Fuck around and get them clothes ?rentin?
Many believe Fat Joe will be the cause of armaggedeon

Chorus 2X

"You gotta flow Joe!"
