(Hook: Fresh)
N****'s out here throwin' dirt up on my neighbors
God Bless
I don't love'em I just try to cheer the game up
God Bless
I'm tryna win chips like LeBron James uh
God Bless
They just did you for the fame uh
God Bless
All I gotta say is God Bless x4

(Verse 1: Maino)
I do this for the riches I don't need the fame
God Bless all my n****'s still movin' caine
Started out with nothing now look what we made
So even when they bury me they'll know my name
Oh God oh God I blew my money up in Aces
Ended up drunk then put my mouth on a waitress
All of them times we didn't shine now we made it
Rolling it dice lets say a prayer for the haters
Back to back foreigns like if I was Meech
They see me treat the Bentley like a Honda lease
Famous b****'s on my line like they on a leash
God Bless all these h** n****'s rest in peace

(Verse 2: Fat Joe)
God Bless all my n****'s in prison
God Bless all the youngest still pitchin'
Had to go to Aces and Bless all the b****'s that's trippin'
Used to run with them but n****'s is trippin'
Stay ever for a G word to Pac I had to ask this s***
Cause I feel we always lasting s***
A n**** self made swear to God I never ask this s***
But police still blastin' kids

In the parades then we shoveling s***
They give you life to tell you hold that s***
And do you follow and the po get rich
My n****'s f*** that s***
