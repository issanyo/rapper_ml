[Fat Joe]
They shootin...This is the sound baby...We ridin on these bitch ass
Niggas...Joe Crack...Here we go

[Hook] + (with adlibs from Fat Joe)
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la...
This is the sound when we ride on our enemies

[Verse 1: Fat Joe]
I thought I told you stay back
You ain't listen the first time
He's the one that I spit in my first rhyme
Now I'm knockin' at your door
With the pistols little bitch niggas you ain't ready for war, my enemies
He's running scared screamin " Crack's back"
So my nigga take that
Niggas tryin' to hate Crack
I'm bringing '88 back
We stay strapped comin' for cowards
Fuck the 9's man we comin' with choppers
Like brat-dat-dit-at(gun shot in background)
That's the sound of them guns
When we come
And you run
Cause you scared and you fear everything you heard about about us
We murder cowards
I know you heard about my words...now niggas bow down

[Hook 2x] + (ad libs from Fat Joe)

[Verse 2: Fat Joe]
One time for my nigga Cool, two time for my nigga Dre
The whole M-I-A
I don't know what you tryin' to portray
But you don't want to see them send my spray
Goin' against our way
Stop, admit it
God forbid it
The way these choppers spit it
You drop in minutes(uhh)
And I don't know how you dare
Nigga stop acting like a bitch you scared
Niggas listen here
And we ain't finished until your mamma in the church
Screamin "Why they took my son up on off this earth"
I know it hurts
And this is the sound when we ride
Niggas die
When our crews collide
My enemies

[Hook] + (ad libs from Fat Joe)

[Fat Joe]
Uhh Cool and Dre on this one
Cali, Whats up nigga
Ohh shout out my nigga ?
All my buddies with money and gold teeth
We ridin 'Fast and Furious'
My nigga Shocker hit me up
I said this is sound when we ride on our enemies

[Hook] till fade + (ad libs from Fat Joe)
