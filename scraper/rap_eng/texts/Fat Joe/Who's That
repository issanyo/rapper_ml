[R. Kelly]
Sitting at the bar with mama
Shorty tryna bring the drama
But she cannot fade the player
Cause this pimp is a money maker
Mettings from Chi-town to L.A
Yo I came to get down at this party
I got my eyes on Keisha and Shante'
Rollin' in like this track was reggae
I roll throught the hottest clubs
With about a houndred thugs
Get up out of thousands hugs
From chicks that wanna sit on dubs

[Chorus]
Yo who's that in the jeep?
(Some honeys)
Who's that up off in that truck?
(My niggas)
Yo what y'all doin' tonight?
(We thuggin')
Yo whats off up in that cup
(Some liquor)
Yo, I'm rollin' wit y'all
(Well lets go)
Shawty where's the alcohol?
(Right here)
Now let me hit that haze
(Fa shizzle)
That would really make my day

[R. Kelly]
Yea, take a plugger for the pool party
Right off up in Miami
Ten G's for the best bikini
Lookin' for the biggest booty
She got the crowd goin' crazy
Cause this track here is so amazing
Yo even with a nigga's life lookin' hazy
Still you R&B cats can't fade me

[Chorus]

[Bridge - R. Kelly]
I'm driving a fast car, jump to the third lane
Mommy a passenger, stealing the champagne
We stop at a red light, she driving me insane
Like, we seened it like a ---------
Stop playing girl the way you shake your phatty back
So sexy the way you tellin' daddy that
Turn that piece around and let me patty that
Got me saying, "Man, I'm tryna marry that"

[Fat Joe]
Oh no, They did it again! (Who?)
Rob and Joe they slept with ten (What?)
Dyme misses, fine misses, big behind misses
All kinds of misses, don't matter, you're my misses
What's love got to do with -----?
And, everyday a new different group of chicks
We headed to the Island of Caymen's
Life of the famous, shorties almost died when we came in
Girl, I know you diggin the diddy bop
This my world come through in the whole city stop
Looks like ice but actually its really not
Diamonds, blindin', all live around me
Five houndred thou and all on the time piece
In the South Bronx you can find me
Nevermind me, thats just how we ball
I'm rollin with y'all now tell me "Where's the alcohol?"

[Chorus]

[Fat Joe]
Come on, make 'em bounce baby
Uh, yeah, uh, keep goin' baby
That chunky, funky, sticky, ooh wheee
Uh, The R, Joe Crack the Don
