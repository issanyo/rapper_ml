[Intro: Fat Joe]
Rihanna, Rihanna, hey ho hey
Madonna, Madonna, hey ho hey
He is a good family man, your Honor
He does give to numerous charities
He did pay back all the money, your Honor
"But do it for America"

[Verse 1: Fat Joe]
For the love of drug dealing, bricks to the ceiling
Tits on display, relatives on payroll
Put my moms in a mansion, mink dragging off the yay
Got lifers ready to kill when I say so
C.O's slide me cellphones
Speak Italian with my capo, Jesus medallions is extravagant
Sitting in the Porsche like I’m Tony M
Niggas tryna X me out, shoot me off the podium
From lux tees to Rugby's, my crime syndicate
I grind in the mix, you niggas rhymed into this
Pump cracks out the wall, back at us all
At Lil Wayne’s crib writing crack on the wall (Crack!)
Barcelona 9’s, but these squeeze all
23 shots off a hardened man jaws
For my Chi Town niggas, Joey need a statue
Cause Joey played the goalie when them things is kickin' at you
Shoot like paparazzi, I go Kanye crazy
Then beat a nigga blue like Beyonce baby
Uh, lifestyle of the realest
Step on Donatella when I’m coming out the villa

[Bridge]
This shit separate me from the pack
I’m the reason why the Hip-Hop Cops came patrolling the block
They must’ve heard I was cooking with rock

[Verse 2: Action Bronson]
Respective path made, the 850 roof is black suede
Hair slicked back like Pat
Driving glove zipped up, speeding tickets getting ripped up
Eating chicken, getting my dick sucked, it's basic
Ronny Fieg Asics
This fucking beat make me feel like I’m in the basement
These fucking drugs make me feel like I’m in the Matrix
With a long trench and a motherfucking feather earring
You better cherish before I perish
Scuba diving off the terrace
Utilizing my athletics
Supersize me on the lettuce, you could keep the beef
Cause I know you’re tryna keep your teeth
I like 'em greek with a petite physique
She make me healthy things to eat and never feed me meat
So I keep Chanel on the feet, I’m a great man
Me and Joey sit at the table, then we ate lamb
Then we shake hands

[Outro: Scratches by DJ Premier]
I’m not a stranger to the court of law
That’s how you got the word for the numbers you sellin'
Niggas yelling out the window “Joe’s at it again!!”
Joe's at it, Joe’s at it, Joe’s at it again!
Why did crack have to hit so hard?
Niggas yelling out the window “Joe’s at it again!”
Said Jojo crack shit’s all the same
(As far as rap go, it's only natural I explain)
These Feds want me for some Tax Evasion

[Action Bronson]
Bam bam Bronsolino
Action Bernstein, Action Constanza
Yo DJ Premier live from headquarters
10 to 12 Friday nights
Get with the fucking program
Listen to that legend
Bam bam Bronsolino in the building Flushing
