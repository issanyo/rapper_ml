[Hook: Fat Joe]
Nothing can stop me, I'm all the way up
All the way up
I'm all the way up
I'm all the way up
Nothing can stop me, I'm all the way up

[Bridge: French Montana]
Shorty what you want ? Short what you need ?
My niggas run the game, we ain't ever leavin'
Countin' up this money, we ain't never sleepin'
You got V12, I got 12 V's
Got bottles, got weed, got molly
I'm all the way up
Shorty what you want ? I got what you need
Shorty what you want ? I got what you need
Shorty what you want ? I got what you need

[Hook: Fat Joe]
I'm all the way up
I'm all the way up
I'm all the way up
All the way up
Nothing can stop me, I'm all the way up

[Verse: Prince Dinero]
Since a youngin', i dreamed of having them rolexes
Started getting lettuce now watch how i'm dressing
Started getting more money, so we ain't really stressing
I put on for my niggas, you better ask about about me
Bunch of bad b*tches and you all see em' round me
More fish in the sea so she ain't never found me
Young nigga big goals so we grinding hard
All these hoes they still treat me like a rising star
I got the game on lock they know i'm coming hard
Young god with the flow, i rap on any beat
All these niggas is fake, but that's the industry
I was sleep for a while but now it's payback
You say it's beef then it's lit so homie say that
Been the man with this rap sh*t i got the crown
Started feelin' myself when hoes recognized
Number one fan from Georgia i ain't local
Say they offered you deals but we don't f*cking know you
Say it ain't worth the wait, now i'ma f*cking show you
When you start doing good they act like they know you
But when you down and out nobody gon' call you
Tried to tell my lil' bro these people ain't loyal
They see you as a bigger step and a benefit
I don't gotta ask for help cause i been the sh*t
Been the man you a fan, stop the chattin' homie
Clip leave a bald spot now his name Ginobili
Cross over with the rock now i'm making movies
And i'm grinding two-four so they call me Kobe
Purple rain rest in peace to the prince
My dope comes in eights so you see how i spend
All this evil going on so it's easy to sin
Cops kill us we dead, now it's back for revenge
How the f*ck they say they fake then snap back to be friends
How the hell you hatin' on me cause they say i go in
How the hell you hatin' on me cause my b*tch ain't give in
And why the f*ck these niggas talking when thy making no ends
My mother told me this gon' happen so i can't act surprised
You closest friends be your enemies, that's they disguise
Half your friends be plottin' nigga, you'll be surprised
They been waiting on this flow tell them hoes i arrived
And i been looking at these followers i be so despised
They say my flow is so sick, cause it's easy to rhyme
And they been trynna' jack my style but it ain't easy so try
These people saying i done changed
But y'all done changed first
How the f*ck i'm gon' forgive if i got hurt first
How the f*ck these people change when they got hurt second
Soon as y'all done they make it seem like you ain't on shit
And i done f*cked with her cousin, so she ain't on shit
And when she found out it happened bet her a** was sick
I know these people talking crazy but they ain't on shit
