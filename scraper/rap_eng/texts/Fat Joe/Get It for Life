[VERSE 1:]
Coca, niggas call me crack in the flesh
Run up on a nigga with a mac'in adress
Hear dat rip through his vest
If you ain't got sticks well you better invest (yes)
A nigga used to dream of that water blue
Now I swapped out for sumtin with killer view
Fresh off the block doin interviews
You can still see the coke on my linen suit
I'm a don, change twice a day
I do it for the love when there's so much hate
Straight out the court room, million dollar bail
Back to the spot, got a million dollar sale

[Chorus:]
I'm a get it for life
Get it for us, get it for love, I'm a keep it alive (yeah, yeah) oh yeah (yeah, yeah)

So much money I'm sittin on mill's
My mansion, bottom of the Poo set scrills
200 over on the Phantom, drop that 650

Sky blue suit with the bow-tie
Yeah [? ] (shiiit)

Had you leanin back till you popped your collar
Mo money (mo money), let's get it (let's get it)
We da best (we da best), I said it (I said it)
