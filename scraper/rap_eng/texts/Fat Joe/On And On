[Verse 1:]
I do it BIG with shoulder staying low key firing lamborghini hoes beat joe lee diamonds
God dwellers never role we do time better watch me puff havanas and wine sellers
Now who's hotter private place from milan to battter while the dawg says shots its the shottas napkins tucked over versace eating pasta baby hard bottoms and bow ties
Duce threes and four fives hey niggas trying to jump man duce threes and four fives hey niggas tryin to jump man and fleet of women getting sun tanned go shot the same day left  the hospital star shit  racketeering and prostitutes hats off to the dawg salute

[Chorus:]
Life life where do your money go is it up your nose or fancy clothes all around the world it goes on and on and on
On and on and on and on one mans dream is a next man reality

[Verse 2:]
Young capo flow fast like marcy olago sometimes i drive slow i find my mind getting right on the block so every now and then i gotta let this Glock go pops told me i am the macho

[Chorus]
