[Fat Joe]
Yeah, uh
I don't give a fuck, fuck you, fuck you too
Fuck you rappers, fuck the industry
Fuck anybody who don't fuck with me, CRACK
Hahaha, this is the Pendemic

[Verse]
We get it poppin', them hammers go
The Spanish bro, Crucial Conflict, I'm Do or Die with the flow
Joe Pesci in Casino, ya know
Poked him 40 times, hit him once more for the road
Yeah, I'm being honest your honor, I killed a man
But he was a fucking problem your honor
They say Joey's a killer, everytime body shit
Every verse iller, ain't nobody hot as this
You know me, I'm a one man army
Even though millions'll follow just like Gandhi
I'm Malcolm, shit I bring it out 'em
Body on Broadway, now nobody can doubt us
Must I be a backpacker or Black Eyed Pea
Or spit conscience shit just to win a Grammy?
Nah, they gonna listen to me
The soul of Big Pun is flowing through me
Yeah, Biggie Smalls is rolling with me
I'm way over your head, you lack creativity
I'm a gangsta rapper, Lord forgive the shit I'm saying
But you'd be surprised where my music be playing
That's what they want to hear
Shit!, Joey from the Bronx, I'm a pistoleer
I keep gunning for 'em, they keep running from me
I'm about my money give a fuck, I'm living comfortably

Yeah, I'm right here, middle of the ghetto
Sweatpants saggin cause I'm packing heavy metal
Yeah I made the switch from clear top to yellow
Mami yelling out the window "Oye déjate con eso"
"I hate that nigga, he makes me sick man, look at him
Soon as I get enough I'mma cuff 'em and throw the book at him
He ain't get all this shit from this fucking rap money
And every time we stop him, nigga think there's something funny
Shit, heard he sells cracks on the block caught a body
Listen to his raps, he calls himself John Gotti"
Officer, officer, please don't be bias
Don't you know all of us rappers are great liars?
We like to exaggerate, dream and imaginate
Sensationalize bringing packs 'cross state
And y'all niggas lying cause young niggas dying
Over in Iraq—yeah families are crying
Controversies like oil for food
Worldwide Pendemic now we got the bird flu
Africa's in crisis, please give aid
Must we do everything like organize Live Aid
Katrina, Katrina, oh Ms. Katrina
I'm looking for some benefits, tell me have you seen her

[Fat Joe]
Yeah...this is the Pendemic
We outta here...(crack)...see you next time if there is a next time
"Thanks to Joey Crack the Gangsta rapper
Do this shit my way like Frank Sinatra"...CRACK
Bye {*echoes*}
