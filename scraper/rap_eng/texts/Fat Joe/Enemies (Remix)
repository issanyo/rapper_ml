[Intro: Prodigy] + (Fat Joe)
Uh oh (Buck 'em down buck 'em down)
Infamous Mobb Deep ya heard (Havoc: Fat Joe)
(Wayne Wonder whattup whattup whattup whattup!!!)
Yo, from Queens to The Bronx, Jamaica to Jamaica you understand

[Verse 1: Havoc]
My pound's spittin, cowards snitchin so what it is
Like a hearty meal in heat, stickin to your ribs
Guerilla style tactic, I learned from growin up in The Bridge
Be down huntin up on you or at your crib
I'm waitin for my enemies while your bent off the Hennessy
Hold the hammer steadily baby girl now you better be
Far from that bitch ass nigga we on fire
Nigga went against the grain so I'm givin 'em more fire
With that lava spittin out of them cannons whattup sire
Mobb connected with Wonder you know that shit is fire
Yeah! And I'm about to squeeze
Got my finger on the trigger then we blow some trees

[Verse 2: Prodigy]
Little kids growin up listen to M-O-B-B
They hear about our guns the word's on the street
We infamous for drama keep that trauma in our reach
We infamous with beef keep them thangs were we be
It be hot where we be
No matter the weather in the drops in the jeeps
You steal from my heat they heard about how we squeeze
Original rudeboys comin out of Queens, you know what I mean
Don't act stupid now
We schooled you niggas how to keep that trigger POW!!!
Where you niggas now, all y'all got a little power
Little bitty strength till I shoot some of your people
Or now I'm makin sense to my....

[Chorus: Wayne Wonder]
My enemies, mi unlock it time I cock it time I pop it
Time I put it pon mi enemies
You won't get away from the ride that comes with atrocities
I got you where I want you now my fingers on the triggers
And I'm about to squeeze, beggin me oh please

[Verse 3: Fat Joe] + (DJ Khalid)
Aiyyo cling cling (Uh oh, where my killas at?)
Joe Crack Joe Crack!!!(And what you gwaan do?)
Head gone, head gone, we got 'em runnin now
Aiyyo Pun look twin we got 'em runnin now
Who waan test I the true king of N.Y
Put out the racthet be like budda budda budda bye bye bye!!!
(PUUUUUULLLLLLLL UUUUUUUUUUPPPPPPPP!!!!!!!!)
Enemies there's no safe haven
You crazy I blaze you now when you bathin in your vacation
I hate waitin no more biz, the fo' fifth will leave 'em leakin
Them small kids are gonna sure miss my (Wayne Wonder: Enenies)
We all got 'em, most high talkin when the babylon lock 'em down
Don't start no shit won't be no shit
Badboy dead rich and he still don't switch
Like at Harlem at the Rucker we live for beef
Cause we didn't see a sign of our...

[Chorus: Wayne Wonder]
My enemies, mi unlock it time I cock it time I pop it
Time I put it pon mi enemies
You won't get away from the ride that comes with atrocities
I got you where I want you now my fingers on the triggers
And I'm about to squeeze, beggin me oh please

[Verse 4: Surpriz AKA Wayne Wonder]
Boy yuh shoulda neva mek my temperature rise
Load up a ready fi go buss at sunrise
Black talon and infared face dem surprised
Dem nuh see a who call DJ disguise
Don't judge becau mi simple mek mi tell oonu dat nuh wise

Pussyhole dead wid oonu fleas and flies
Car crash a dranco hitch upon dry eyes, so

[Chorus: Wayne Wonder]
My enemies, mi unlock it time I cock it time I pop it
Time I put it pon mi enemies
You won't get away from the ride that comes with a atrocites
I got you where I want you now my fingers on the triggers
And I'm about to squeeze, beggin me oh please
