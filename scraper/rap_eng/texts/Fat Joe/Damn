My niggas it Coca
It's crackology 101, Nigga
I breed you Nigga's
My son

Owww

[1st Verse]
The penalty is death
And I'm inflicting the torture
The best of the best couldn't mess with the boogy down Bronxster
Its heavy promo catching beef wit Joe
But my man don't get caught up in these streets alone
Thought we heavy
Chopper firerin
Motherfucker's is dying
Nigga's is runnin'
Helicopters is flying
All these suckers is lying
Tell these Fedsters to see me
And I was just island hopping somewhere in Tahiti
I think its called Fiji or something like that
Get your shit pushed Motherfucker
Fucking wit crack
Catch a hundred in your cap
Your brain be by your waste line
LV on the track
Hell of a baseline
Remind me of the times I was serving them baselines
Only Puerto Rican in Harlem
Now that's stardom
Ghetto Celeb I been since I was younger
Hundred mill strong
Still dying of hunger
Under the chinchilla
Believe me this shits is rilla
This piece ull leave you in pieces
And make you sleep better
The streets terror
The weak better retreat man
I keep Beretta's so heathen's can creep

[Chorus: repeat 2X]
Damn, those guys are gettin doe
That's why all these gansta call me Coke
We get money money
You got nothing from me
And if you get caught Nigga don't mention Joe

[2nd Verse]
I keep hearin that Crack the truth
Real niggas is scream
Joe get back in the booth
Yeah I do it for them niggas that be huggin the block
Them jack boys don't give a fuck
Dumpin there caps
These niggas crazy
Some more real
They'll git you for everything
Even your Paul Wall grill
Yes Nigga
Its survival out here
These niggas don't even respect the bible out here
Its pyro's out here
Cuts and King too
That's the only thing the summer going bring you
I seen it all, man they love it when I spit game
Walk through the middle of Speed wit the big chain
I got 'em sick man
Look how the shit bling
Piss stain
Yellow pebble bezel on the wrist man
You ain't Pac
You ain't even a great actor
Matter of fact
You is a great actor
I'm one O G
You need to respect
Especially if you don't want niggas to see through your chest
I caught his Mama at the face to face
Now she laying in St. Raymond's in Section 8
Nigga
Follow me now say

[Chorus]

Yeah
This goes out to all the Nigga's
From Ghetto to Ghetto
Jail for  Jail
All my niggas playin' in the yards right now
Doin' pull ups
Bumpin'' this shit in your headsets
I love you Nigga's

Crack
Otisville you know its real
Rikers
All my niggas holding in down
All my street niggas gansta Nigga's
Cook
