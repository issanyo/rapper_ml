[Intro: French Montana]
Darkside
Montana.. Crack..
Wooooooooo, it's comin'
Before you get ya head, blown, off
Leave me alone, leave me alone

[Chorus: French Montana]
Before you get ya head blown off
I got a big sawed-off, rinnnn'
Hang you with the shoulder strap, ohhhhh
Black gun, black car, black ones
Black card, uhhhhhh, uhhhhhhh
We the black mob, everything black, dog
Welcome to the darkside (Joe, Crack)
Darkside (Joe, Crack)
Darkside (Joe, Crack) darkside
Black car, black ones
Black card, uhhhhhh, uhhhhhhh
We the black mob, everything black, dog

[Verse 1: Fat Joe]
Yeah, uhh
Darkside, woo!
Go, go -- what's this phenomenon?
Rose, gold -- prezzie on my arm
Straps you with precision, math, do the division
Crack ruin my vision, now all I do is the kitchen
I wanted to ball, maybe for Gramblin' steak
Now all I do is ball, I started slingin' eighths
Halves, wholes, everyone around me
Cash, rules, everything around me
Make it rain, make it, make it, make it rain, whoa
I make it rain, I make it rain on them hoes, whoa
Pop, that, pussy, bitch
Pop, bottles, in this, bitch

[Chorus: French Montana]
Before you get ya head blown off
I got a big sawed-off, rinnnn'
Hang you with the shoulder strap, ohhhhh
Black gun, black car, black ones
Black card, uhhhhhh, uhhhhhhh
We the black mob, everything black, dog
Welcome to the darkside (Joe, Crack)
Darkside (Joe, Crack)
Darkside (Joe, Crack) darkside
Black car, black ones
Black card, uhhhhhh, uhhhhhhh
We the black mob, everything black, dog

[Verse 2: Fat Joe]
Yeah, woo!!
Go, go -- what's this phenomenon?
Rolls, Royce -- steerin' wheel in my palm
Push it down, push it down, where? 8th Ave
Hundred rounds, hundred rounds, where? St. Annes
Fuck talkin' we clappin' (clappin') fuck walkin' we traffic (traffic)
You movin' out the projects, we movin that package
You snitchin' and rattin' (rattin') you bitch and you askin'
You'll look up to me nigga, even if it's in a casket
Oh, God, exportin' baby
Joe, hard, it's Coca baby
Pop, that, pussy, bitch
Pop, bottles, in this, bitch

[Chorus: French Montana]
Before you get ya head blown off
I got a big sawed-off, rinnnn'
Hang you with the shoulder strap, ohhhhh
Black gun, black car, black ones
Black card, uhhhhhh, uhhhhhhh
We the black mob, everything black, dog
Welcome to the darkside (Joe, Crack)
Darkside (Joe, Crack)
