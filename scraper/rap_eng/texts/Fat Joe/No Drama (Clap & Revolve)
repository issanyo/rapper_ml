Nine check Forty check
K's check You be the first to go
Haze yes
Ye yes
Motherfucker this is business, never personal
This Coca baby
I'm an 88er
I put work in these streets
Now do yourself the favor
You bring the drama
Then drama leads to choppers
Then them choppers get to sprayin'
And somebody need a doctor now
You not an actor, not a rapper
You's a clapper, you's a trapper
Got a ratchet, so why you hire coppers now
It is what it is; I got the gliz on me
And don't nobody want it with the Big homey

[Hook] - 2X

[Fat Joe]
Nigga want beef with me
Must be out of his mind
Nigga think that Joey past his prime
Layed his ass flat in the street
Yeah I splattered his mind
Walk away with his life and his shines
Yeah, I smell pussy pussy
Yeah pussy pussy
That's how h e looked when I left his fuckin face gushy
Ask about it
Cracks about it
Went back to the crib and then we laughed about it
I'm a rider, I'm a sider - I'n a money maker
I decided you's a liar when it comes to paper
Broad day we could clap it in these streets
Middle the PJ's make em bring out these sheets

[Hook]

[Fat Joe]
I got a thing for my little buddy
That black Mac do his thing
Leave a Nigga ugly
Yo tell me the best of the best won't fix em

And I'm a rat killer
You hear that BR-Rat Nigga
I don't rap infact I'm just that Nigga
Yeah it's crack Nigga
A lot of bitches like to talk
Make em bite they tongue
Lot of niggas claim New York but they not the one

We don't dance in your face, you muh'fuckers choke
