Rucker, three-peat champ, see us Lakers (whattup Reem?)
Homey please don't hate us
She said that she was single, yo leave or make up - DAMN!
I'm out in L.A. within a week
Honies go to {?} from and they cut (aowwww)
V.A. is you wit me now
Couple bricks of that yay and it's Philly bound, feel me now
I'd rather die in prison, than to be a broke nigga
Live my life in the kitchen, into bakin pies
One of my addictions, on the mound
95 mile per hour pitches, volleyball servin 'em
The iron is itchin
To straighten any nigga out tryin to diss on... Crack

Ain't gotta be celebrity to get with me, shit

As long as they head right and ass fat
I put a pillow over they face and ass that - Crack
'Bout to cruise down your avenue
In the back of that Cad, think collateral
