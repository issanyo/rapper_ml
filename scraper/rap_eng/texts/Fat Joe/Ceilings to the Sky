[Intro]
This don' shit on me
This my shit right here
When it comes to this money shit
This what I do:
These niggas my sons
I own this shit!
CoKe Da Don
TS (Uh)

[Chorus: Timati]
Sky's not the limit, it's just a view
We're up here staring at you:
Ceilings to the sky
Ceilings to the sky
Ceilings to the sky
Ceilings to the sky!

[Verse 1: Fat Joe]
Yeah, a couple kilos on the neck, away to Cuba Connect
It’s like I’m for Dela, way we ruling the checks
Red bone on the passenger, feeling like the chosen
Tacking make the mess, had to real poke cose in it
Villa on the ocean, water look like mouth wash
Hundred acres, gotta move around a golf cart
Panthers in the backyard, charged it to the black card:
Uh, now that’s animal cruelty!
Interior designed by Emilio Pucci
Got supermodel chicks, callin’ me boughie!
Uh, my chauffeur get’s chauffeur
Pimped the whip; miss the "showed up in the new fur"
Hickey cure, more money
What would have happened if they never killed sunny!
God for the stick, got the God for the lit
Now who the fuck got the Godfather hit!

[Chorus: Timati]
Sky's not the limit, it's just a view
We're up here staring at you:
Ceilings to the sky
Ceilings to the sky, (Dolpins in the back yard)
Ceilings to the sky, (Sandy chandeliers)
Ceilings to the sky!

[Verse 2: Fat Joe]
Yeah uh, you basic niggas: I'll basically murder you
Lyrically or out the back of the convertible!
I’m a dawg fresh shit - all the way to heaven
Six shot, one in the head: my lucky seven
I’m a mathmatician: straight with numbers, three million ways
Sixty pounds and all hundreds;
Lost some weight now they’re calling me fancy;
Ring side will lie and merge in the Jim Lampley!
My land ski, ice blue lamby:
Chilling with andi and places you nigga can’t be
Rebello frames and cop me an optical:
Sneaker fame belongs in the hospital
Straight jacket, it’s about main dough
Rags to riches; you can still feel my pain dough
Fat nigga: over twenty million sold
And I’ve been doing this since I'm twenty years old nigga!

[Chorus: Timati]
Sky's not the limit, it's just a view
We're up here staring at you:
Ceilings to the sky
Ceilings to the sky
Ceilings to the sky
Ceilings to the sky!
