[Intro]
This should be played at high volume

[Fat Joe]
This is, this is, this is
Cook! Cool n Dre!
Ain't nobody seeing this right here, we see nobody

[Hook]
I know you came to party so (Oh) get up on yo feet (The god just stepped in town)
Yeah baby just trip that body (come on down), and sing along wit me (come on)
I know you've been searchin' for someone who
Satisfies you and gives you so much more

[Verse 1]
(Yo) Caution when my lip just twitch to one side
We don't bitch, we don't snitch
We thick, and just ride
And I, never gave a fuck about popo
Niggas so gangsta, making songs bout my .44
My, mymy fofo fofofofo
It gets worse, kick my shit when I visit the church
I'm down wit TD Jakes and Kirk Franklin
Better have my offerin' plate filled wit' franklins
Blasphemy, I got niggas that'll blast for me
Ribs touchin and they askin' me, Crack! Nigga!
Show me where the safe bet, I'll lay 'em down with the mac
Leave 'em face flat, listen
You don't wanna start no drama
We don't scrap when there's problems we just clap and revolve 'em
And get it coke, let it go, head it ___, sippin mo, didn't know? Better know now

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Puff and pass in the Hilton suite
Crush and pass, is the sick, tape me
I'll probably when i, ask her didn't know the dick ten feet
You'll need a ladder just to sit on me
(Good! God!) In the race screamin' viva Tito
Wit' Don 'kee Maddison Square, arena people
I pull mammi to the side, she feel me
Yellin' punta a gasolina
Now how many bricks does it take, to marble out a 36 room estate
Follow me, I'm from Philly where they eat cheese steaks
In a red belly, call a bitch v8 (Uh yeah)
It's Joe cr-eal, for-real
And even warn the kids in school on coke deals (Crack!)
(I'm back!) And that's the seltzer
You should know how the shit gon' go, follow me!

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
That's the sound of a man, workin' on a train
There he ain't (crack!) yeah
And we don't see nobody
Make your hair stand up like you're "Growin Up Gotti"
Hit lyrics everytime we come out, nigga
Use a fist 'fo' it come out ya mouth
The way I'm stackin white these days
Looking like a chick that go wit Flava Flav
And I'm so so real, niggas wanna kill the Don
Front of my house, probably wit my son in my arms
But I, drop 'em like its hot
Pass 'em the Glock, my little shorty's a chip off the old block
Go against Coke, let 'em and show
I give you 10 ways to kill off the whole block (Nigga!)

[Hook 3X]

[Outro]
Wooooooooooo
Yeah, that's how a motherfucker go down
3 o'clock in the mornin', m.i.a. nigga
Missin' in action down in Miami nigga
Bitch, its Crack!
Cool n Dre, realz
Uh oh, sound all fuckin shitty
