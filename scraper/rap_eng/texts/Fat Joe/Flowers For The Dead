[Intro: Cuban Link]
Let's have a moment of silence for those that ain't here right now
I know you're up in heaven smiling down
You might be gone, but never forgotten
Flowers for the dead
At times, I still hear your voice in my head
But I wish you was here instead
And all our precious memories, I'll never forget

[Verse 1: Cuban Link]
Twin, we've been best friends ever since we were little kids
So I sit and reminisce on all the things we ever did
I remember all the stupid shit I can't forget
Hope God forgive us for our sins and give you the strength to live
Far from sensitive, but I'm shedding tears right now
Cause I'm watching you fight for your life and I can't help out
Meanwhile, the doctor's shocking your chest, checking for breath
I was with you from the stretcher to the hospital bed
Not believing it yet, everybody sad and depressed
Counting your blessings, praying and praying, hoping for the best
Waitin' in bed, your wife duke shaking from stress
Breaking in tears and fear, cause dog, she love you 'til death
Next thing you know, the doctor comes out, just shaking his head
Nothing was said but I betted in his face full of sweat
You were dead, just all I saw instead was blood shot red
And I felt a chill throughout my body that I'll never forget
God bless you

[Hook: D'Mingo]
Flowers for the dead
At times I hear your voice still in my head
Wishing you were here instead
These precious memories I can't forget
(La flore pa' los muertos)
Flowers for the dead
At times I hear your voice still in my head
Wishing you were here instead
These precious memories I can't forget

[Verse 2: Cuban Link]
In my sleep, I hear you speaking to me and feel you reaching to me
Wish I could see you, though I know you with me spiritually
Physically, right here besides me is where I need you to be
Keeping me company and take over this whole industry
Memories of when we used to be too deep in the streets
If there was beef, we had each others backs naturally
If there was need for me to grab the heat, you'd grab it from me
And blast off with no remorse just as long as its me
Young indeed, we sat and chat on the block puffing trees
Guzzling Hennessy, playing knuckles 'til one of us bleed
You used to eat Rocks and read encyclopedias to me
You was a genius, even though you had no college degree
We were homies, but you will always be a brother to me
So close, we always gave each other kiss on the cheek
Big P, your legacy will always live on the street
And best believe I'm a be there for your wife and three seeds
Rest in peace

[Hook: D'Mingo]

[Verse 3: Cuban Link]
Yeah, this is dedicated to the ones who never made it
I hated the fact you faded away, you were the greatest
So I say this prayer to pay my respects, I'll never forget you cause you special
I'll catch you in my heart, may God bless you
Rest in peace to my peoples who passed away
Best believe I'm a keep you alive always
'Til the day we meet again, face to face with a grin
In Hell or Heaven, you my twin to the end
And I'm a miss you

[Hook: D'Mingo]
Flowers for the dead
At times I hear your voice still in my head
Wishing you were here instead
These precious memories I can't forget
(La flore pa' los muertos)
Flowers for the dead
At times I hear your voice still in my head
Wishing you were here instead
These precious memories I can't forget

[Outro]
Rest in peace, nigga
I know you chillin', I know you chillin'
