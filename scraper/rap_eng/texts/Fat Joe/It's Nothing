(feat. Tony Sunshine)

Yeah. Uhh. Joe crack the don!
Ton' Sunshine. Terror, uhh
Terror squad, its our time!
Uhh, yea, hand it ova
Uh, yo, uh-huh, what, yea, uh... woo

[Verse 1]
Yea, mami jus like that bend down grab ya ankles, do it for crack
Damn should be illegal how that ass so fat
The way you shake yo shit make me wanna cop back
Is it ya motion causing all this commotion?
Forget niggas you even got bitches approaching
Who am I? I'm just a kid from the Bronx
If you love hip-hop you might of heard my shit once
Or maybe twice or like thirteen thousand times
I'm sick of it myself I'm loving the shine
Who else could it be but the squad's O.G?
Be laid up Wit chicks that resemble  ?
Half black, Japanese n something
MÃ©nages, orgies believe me its nothing
The girls want tha facts got to feed 'em the lies
Who else can have you swimming in wealth the blink of an eye?

[Chorus]
Big trucks, gee rides, we fly, twenty-fo' won't you sit in them tires
Believe me its nothing
G-4 ? Just won't mix with my ride keep a strap on my side
Believe me its nothing
Fast women, bad bitches, down hoes, hood rich, pitch up in Daddy's hooood
Believe me its nothing
Big trucks mean rides we fly t-squad our time
Believe me is nothing

[Verse 2]
Drop from Harlem even, more for Brooklyn
Still got my Name covering the walls in central Brooklyn
Haters want me, they love to slut me
Mad because my fat ass stay - living comfy
Down in d-r on the landing strip
When record sales get low we back to advancing bricks
Jack-of-all-trades we do that too
The only rapper get the Suge Knight effect when he come through
When pun died, half of y'all cried
The other half wanna See my demise
It was inevitable the sqaud'll reach new heights it's unforgettable
Follow the don is all we kept telling you
Once you down with the squad you can never give up
No need to get ya jewel's back, let them other crews do that
It's so ironic that I'm under fire I'm like 'mine'll get better one time' you dick blowers

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
No ya, not dreaming, it's not a visage
It's just another platinum plaque to add to my garage
Ten years in the game - and still going hard -
Fuck a club we flood the studio wit broads
Uhh, my whole life never been more focused
Joes the don ask Jennifer Lopez
What the hell in the world did they do to provoke this?
The newspaper reported the scene was atrocious
And still find the time to please girls
Even get hit on by the chick on Cenas world
We beens about it, y'all dudes is frontin'
Big cars, big chips, big Kris' its nothing

[Chorus]
