Crack

[Hook]
For every shell that fell
There's a story to tell
They say you hustler then you going to hell
Nah, I know God love's me
Yeah, I know that he fucks with me
Can a gangster go to heaven
Let me in
I call it survival you call it a sin
Damn
I got a story to tell
Yeah, I got a story to tell

[1st Verse]
Yeah I'm right here
Gun in my right palm
Nigga tried and trap me and cage me like my san
Oh shit this mic on
I'm speaking my thoughts Nigga
You catch a hundred if you speaking in court
I'm feeling like Michael
Just before the verdict
Sweat on my forehead
I'm anxious and nervous
These streets ull eat you if you let em
Cop ull beat you
You pumping diesel then them Jack boys ull beat you
I try and listen more and speak less
Cause all that Barber shop talking ull put a Nigga to deep rest
You on the corner and I'm flying buy
Some foreign exotic mo' fucker
You know we flying buy
Oh you got nine lives
I got a pine box
You might as well hop your ass in it cause my iron popped
And I ain't lying Ac
Yeah I'm lionheart
Run up on anybody that's supplying my block

[Hook]

[2nd Verse]
I know this Nigga named Shaheim
An old school cat
Did Football numbers
And never once rat
Now he back on the block got em slinging them packs
And his rep's kind of crazy
Known for slinging them Macks
Got a baby with Sandra
Names him K-Sacks
Cause that's where he did his first bid way back
Now this Nigga Sha' got like a memory lapse
Basically you give him work and he ain't payin' back
Now with some connects you could away with that
But he must of fucked wit the wrong Columbian cats
Now these niggas comin' strapped they want they money back
And you can't tell the difference cause some of them look black
Now Sha on the block thinkin' life's a joke
And his Mama just had a dream that he might get smoked
But he don't give a fuck he been through the best wars
Knife to knife
The yard to mess halls
And these niggas here have something else in mine
Like a hundred shots fired at a pretzel less spine
Uh huh, you guessed it
Just a matter of time
Another soldier down he got hit with a nine
Dang

[Hook]

[3rd Verse]
Nah I ain't a rapper
Motha fuck rap
They snitched on Kim
How lame is that
This game ain't shit
But snakes and rats
Fighting each other for loose change and scraps
My Nigga kicked you right on your back when you down
No life preservers
They wanna see you drown
Pull the trigger myself
They don't want know help
Now the only Nigga tell on myself is myself
Money Power Respect
You heard the Lox
Half these niggas in here deserve to get popped
I think we another fuckin Biggy and Pac
So you Mo' fuckers could have another million man march
