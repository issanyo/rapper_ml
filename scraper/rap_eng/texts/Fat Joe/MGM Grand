[ Intro ]
Oye money eta vaina ta calientisimo aqui loco que lo que contigo
Tengo una pila mono por todo lao loco esto e rapido muevete

[ Verse 1 ]
I'm the realest nigga in here
You already know it
A lot of you is fuck boys
You already showed it
Use a straw to sip the MoÃ«t
Diamonds on the Cuban
Where the fuck have you been
I'm producing Rick Rubin
Some of you call it Britney
Rest in peace Whitney
But when you live your dreams nightmares could turn in tricky
Chase until your heart stops
Some niggas don't make eighteen
I was pitching hard rocks while you was watching A-Team
Rocky Balboa
Hard white ain't a mystery
And I'm rocking more gold chains than Mr. T
I love strippers like 2 Chainz
In that new mousolini
Bumpin new slaves

[ Hook x2 ]
MGM Vegas on a late night
Bet I put the bread that's a cake fight
Lil broad I'm a put your bra in a fat pussy
Love to take you raw and bring it back to me

[ Bridge ]
Oh my Mexicana baby
Tu ta fuelte
Mi seniorita
Yes lord
My Columbiana baby
Cocaina
Mi catalina
That raw

[ Verse 2 ]
Platinum crucifixes
Diamonds in the crown of thorns
And you popped up out the hood
Survived the phantom doors
It's a suicide
It's a suicide
Pitching Justin Timberlake
No suit and ties
A pair Timberlands and a hoodie on
They wanna strap me to the same bed they put Tookie on
Fuck em though
I'm screaming TS is aboard the flight
Six people on a twelve seater for the night
Now that's six niggas with straps
Six figures to match
On our way to Vegas with yo bitch rolling the craps
Put it all on crack and watch the money show
A pair of Christians have your bitches catch the Holy Ghost

[ Hook x2 ]
MGM Vegas on a late night
Bet I put the bread that's a cake fight
Lil broad I'm a put your bra in a fat pussy
Love to take you raw and bring it back to me

[ Outro ]
Oh my Mexicana baby
Tu ta fuelte
Mi seniorita
