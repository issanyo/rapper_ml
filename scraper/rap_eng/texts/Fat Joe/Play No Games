[Verse 1: Fat Joe]
Ain't no tellin' what a bitch will do
For the dough, she'll probably get on four and fuck the crew
Down south, Up north be the same ass bitches
Man locked up but mama watchin' the children
Talkin' bout my neck my back
Bitch you better learn how to chop rocks if you wanna get with Crack
Ughh, I been in love once, at least I though that
'til I fucked around and hit a broad back
Got burnt, Now you figure the rest
Dick hurt like I'm pissin' baguettes, now I'm livin' depressed
Should have known better than to trust a ho
Especially she wanna know how much doe you hold
Cause there ain't too many real bitches
If you got one hold on, don't wanna be nobody's meal ticket
And you know it don't mean shit to me
Cause you know, Bitches ain't shit to me
What?

[Verse 2: Trick Daddy]
You see the problem is them busta ass niggas you been fuckin' with
Always bought ya shit, but never taught ya shit
Did he ever tell you some things that a playa do
And made you aware that life is more than a hairdo
Boy I tell ya, Best to deal with them real niggas
And stay far away from fuck niggas
Don't be a sucka, Hell at least not from nothin'
All this suckin' and fuckin' a bitch better have somethin'
I need something that's compatible
Not nothin young and dumb and full of cum, But one that's edible
I bet a, nigga like T Double
Get it wetter, Suck and fuck'em better than the average nigga
I need a girl thats into tryin' thangs
So I can put it in her mouth, Fa real ain't into mind games
I know shes a mama girl and I'm a street nigga
Once we get together, I'll bet you she'll sleep better
