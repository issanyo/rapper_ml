[Intro]
Mark Henry...

[Verse 1]
Yeah, uhh, yo
Familiar sound of the trumpets
Triumphantly, playing in my circumference
The sound of the substance
Bubbling in my mind, every time I'm touching hundreds
Hustlers know this feeling and they love it
But God bless the men serving years by the dozens
'Cause all I ever wanted was the finer things, who doesn't
Now (?) getting knocked, it break a brother heart
All our shit is wired, tapped, I said it from the start
Around (?), dead a nigga, made it out of hell
I started my journey the day they taught me how to sell
To this day they still trying to get niggas to tell
So fuck the DEA and fuck sitting in a cell
I'd rather sit comfy on a 90 foot yacht
All aboard, model hoes and my criminal confidants
Toast champagne celebrate that we living
And if you disagree, a 1000 shots is what I'm giving, nigga

[Chorus]
Uh, drop a body on 'em, uh huh
Drop a body on 'em, yeah
Drop a body on 'em
Close casket, nobody saw him

[Verse 2]
Crime sagas from an entrepreneur
Of white powder, distributed clean at night hours
Purchasing firearms, praying God forgive us
But thank God for money and the pussy that it bring us
If hell has a penthouse, I'll be up in it
The mind state of a desperate nigga chasing digits
Roam the yard with the Grim Reaper, watch ya step
'Cause your very last breath could lead you to your death
Picture got money, you can keep your thoughts
Just give me head and (?) hills and bleed you (?)
And recognize a Don when you in his presence
And ask Bishop Eddie Long if dogs go to heaven, woo! Uh

[Chorus]
Uh, drop a body on 'em, uh huh
Drop a body on 'em, yeah
Drop a body on 'em
Close casket, nobody saw him

[Outro]
Yeah, I told you nigga I go hard
Very hard, nigga
Darkside 2 coming your way nigga, arrr!
