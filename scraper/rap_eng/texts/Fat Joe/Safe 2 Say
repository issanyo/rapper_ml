Just Blaze, you a rebel
On this beat nigga, uh
Once again back is the incredible
The incredible

Stop the presses, I'm back, cook Coke, that is
Crack, ain't been gone before a week
And still the fiends line up for blocks till it ain't no space
Pile high to the top of the Empire State

Crack once again so you know it
Ain't been this much hype since that Nas and that Hov shit
Coke spit, the fo' fifth chrome spit
Doe getter since I was small, no better than yours

Truly just check the suicide doors
Thirty inch grill and that black mink floor
Lookin' back I did the shit to death
I guess I ain't killin' it this rhyme, I'm here to raise the dead

I'm here to raise the stakes this time it's ten mill
Supply the sink ill, ship five and then build
And I'm Joe Crack, BX finest
Do rewind this Terror Squad behind this

I got the streets on smash
Niggas on the corner watching me roll past
The bitches they all gasp saying
Once again, back is the incredible
Damn right
(The incredible, the incredible)

I got the heat on blast
Love the seats reclining on that mean G4
'Cause down in New York they saying
Once again, back is the incredible
Damn right
(The incredible, the incredible)

Dope man, dope man, I got that coke man
Brother Joe, man the king of the streets
TS, we incredibly credible like Stun said
It was inevitable the metal was 'gon bump heads

And you know that K go chop, chop, chop
In broad daylight right in front of the One Stop Shop
I'm from Misery Boulevard, right across the street
From I Hope You Die Place, in school, study the crime rate

That's when it became apparent to me
That the pimps and hustlers be apparent to me
I plead innocent your honor
I'm just a product of the streets, product of some beef

Product of that Cappadonna Armani three piece
Problem is when I win, my team eats
But wait, just think the opposite of that
You'll be starin' down the opposite side of them gats, nigga

I got the streets on smash
Niggas on the corner watching me roll past
The bitches they all gasp saying
Once again, back is the incredible
Damn right
(The incredible, the incredible)

I got the heat on blast
Love the seats reclining on that mean G4
'Cause down in New York they saying
Once again, back is the incredible
Damn right
(The incredible, the incredible)

Yo, now have you ever felt the metal to your melon, it just cock back?
Ask for the money and drugs, and you ain't got that
Where the cops at? Prayin' that they comin'
Just a few seconds your brains be layin' on your stomach

On my waist you know I got keep that oven
For ya ginger bread pie ass niggas
The heat's running on high, Joe Crack I
Bake the cake and serve you niggas humble pie

I got the streets on smash
Niggas on the corner watching me roll past
The bitches they all gasp saying
Once again, back is the incredible
Damn right
(The incredible, the incredible)

I got the heat on blast
Love the seats reclining on that mean G4
'Cause down in New York they saying
Once again, back is the incredible
The incredible, the incredible

Yeah, Cook, just Blaze
You a rebel on this beat nigga
