[Verse 1: Fat Joe]
Black bottles, black models
Cuban cigars, Domincanos
Colombianos, it's [?]
100 dope boys on the sofa
I'm going fishin' with Versace on
Stars on the roof for the ambiance
Dug up some more hundreds, fought a few cases
Now we in the club throwing blue faces
Used to see Papi at the [?]
Now I'm crack sittin' on gold toilets
Pure heroine brings more spoils
Large, you people never be royal

[Hook: Jennifer Lopez]
You can buy me way more bottles then them other sections
Leave 1000 dollar tip, what blessin'
All eyes on us, ain't nobody in the club lookin' at your direction
So let me ask you one question
Do we look like we're stressin'? Cause we ain't
Do we look like we're stressin'? Cause we ain't
Do we look like we're stressin'? Cause we ain't

[Verse 2: Fat Joe]
Coke [?] more opus
Break up the makeup, we got motives
I market America, that teamwork
Three keys in my sleep, now that's dream work
It's the Hublot show
Seven figures on the wrist like you don't know
The haters lookin' at me cause the mommies lookin' at me
Fed's lookin' at me, all the snitches lookin' happy
Fo' hunnid on the race, that's hella dough
Just to see the stars with no telescope
I got the pussy wetter than that yayo
Get it off of the block, that J. Lo

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Fat Joe]
Alexander McQueen, Balmain Jeans
Everything all black like the Beijing
Cop the Red Octobers since the Valentine
Have Cupid shoot that ass like 1000 times
In the cell got the wrong number
But she gone be in La Marina all summer
And she gone be up in my tub half naked
And I just sold the plug [?]

[Hook]
