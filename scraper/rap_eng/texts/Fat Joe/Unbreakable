[Verse: Big Scoob]
Not the man I oughta be
But I'm the man I'm taught to be
Blame it on the H.O.G. in me
I guess that I'm just my fathers seed
From all the stories told to me
Just living how its supposed to be
Get your bread is old to me
All you women hoes to me
But then you came and changed my world
Direct hit from Cupid's arrow
Heaven sent my benefit
She's god's gift to a life and pearl

[Bridge: Brandoshis]
I know it hurt it when I get it on
But you still took me back
Mama raised me wild she didn't raise no bull
How did I do you like that
When I get locked up
You still stood by my side
We been through our ups and downs
But this love I just can't hide

[Hook: Brandoshis]
We''re unstoppable. we're unbreakable
We''re unstoppable. we're unbreakable
Made this song for your girl, just to let you know
You my shawty
We''re unstoppable. we're unbreakable
We''re unstoppable. we're unbreakable
