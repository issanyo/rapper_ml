[R&B sample]
I was born and raised in the ghetto {*2X*}

[Intro: Fat Joe]
Coca, uhh, Krillz-mania, dale dale
All my niggas locked down
Doin that time, you heard me?
This for you
("How do we get rid of rats, in the ghetto")
We kill 'em
("How do we get rid of rats, in the ghetto")
Fuck-boy niggas, let's go

[Fat Joe]
These niggas bitchin they snitchin they talkin to the coppers
They plan to stop us and lock us, surround us by helicopters
Joe got hella choppers and hella rockets, propeller poppers
You better watch what you sayin, you sing and this ain't the opera
Push your shit back like a Tracy album, you wildin
I heard you pussy you was cryin minute you stepped on the Island
Howlin - they tryin to dead us to stop the cheddar
Now I'm forever gon' get it admit it this nigga's shittin
Animal Hannibal flow, these hands'll damage you though
It's understandable you tangible we'll dismantle your bones
Chillin with my killers in my platinum Rolls
Trinity's the avenue, anybody yappin well they got to go
Find his whole body decomposed, black hoodie reaper clothes
Shit if his momma seen him wouldn't even know
Joe, I'm a don, the son of a God
One of the hardest to ever yell out the Terror Squad

[Chorus]
("How do we get rid of rats, in the ghetto") Yeah
("How do we get rid of rats, in the ghetto") Ka-ka-ka-ka-kill 'em
("How do we get rid of rats, in the ghetto") Uhh, street shit right here
("How do we get rid of rats, in the ghetto") Kill 'em, Street Runner

[Fat Joe]
Uhh, yo, yo
Joey don't know never seen never heard shit
Niggas is harassin me, tryin to get the murders kid
I don't know them birds flew/flu, I don't know them killers went
Mug shots you showin me these niggas probably innocent
These live niggas turned coat, now witnesses
They'll even tell on they moms, what the business is
We even got some right here in the business kid
And I ain't even gotta say no names, you know them niggas is
Coca, movin blow down to Villanova
Up to Poughkeepsie, got some new birds for Newburgh
I don't know if you got the news, I'm a shoot-er
And if that bitch ever get to talkin I will shoot her
Come with them dogs, go to war with the true birds
My moms on my mind, keep yellin I'm a loser
Word to my nigga Pun, and his Honda scooter
I lay a motherfucker down and throw away the Ruger

[Chorus]
("How do we get rid of rats, in the ghetto")
You know, Pistol this one's for you
("How do we get rid of rats, in the ghetto")
Coca, Streets
("How do we get rid of rats, in the ghetto")
We kill 'em nigga, that's how!
("How do we get rid of rats, in the ghetto")
Brrap, brrrap brrap {*gunshot*}

[Fat Joe]
Kill 'em, spill 'em, hang 'em off the ceiling
Fuck it throw him off the building watch him land on his children
I am just a man but the plan is to fill 'em
Hundred rounds and better if he shut up he'd be chillin
Got a can like a frying pan, hotter than a skillet
Give a nigga his life, now he got his name on a bullet
Pull it~! Pull it~! Nigga don't hesitate, levitate
Anybody soul who cooperates
Feds right on top of me, duck 'em like Apollo Creed
If you wanna find me well I'm anywhere the dollars be
Killer shit is outta me, give it to whatever nigga wanted me
In the Bronx River where the bodies be, fuck-boys!

[Outro: repeat 4X]
("How do we get rid of rats, in the ghetto")
