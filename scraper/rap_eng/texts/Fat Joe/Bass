Feat. Nick Shades
[Intro: Fat Joe]
Yeah! Uh! Uh!

[Verse One: Fat Joe]
I hate when niggas tell their stories talkin when they use to have it
Me I gotta get it I get money have it
I grew up livin savage ain't no need in goin backwards
Unless you talkin Biggie and +Hypnotize+ that's a classic
My life story nothin short of monumental
The way I work the max I got a golden m emblem
Some would say a legend I'm aight with movin kilos
Three on the neck a couple more for my amigos
Trap jumpin Michael Jordan Carolina Tarheels
Pumpin that sick pasta shit that have you doin cartwheels
Different kinda bounce slained niggas might not recover
Face of death row I ain't talkin +Vibe+ cover
But since you talkin 90's that was me with the chainsaw
I'm just tryin to see if the beef would remain raw
I just want the pussy and, please don't save more
And quit askin question 'bout what the AK for?
I stick it out the window start blastin it
Bullets flyin niggas duckin like it's classic shit
Speed off right after I heat up your girl's car
Last thing you wanna hear is +Worldstar+

[Chorus: Fat Joe] (Sample)
The fiends want (Bass) So I feed 'em (Bass)
Not an 808 (Bass) They want that free (Bass)
The fiends want (Bass) So I feed 'em (Bass)
Not an 808 (Bass) They want that free (Bass)
The fiends want (Bass) So I feed 'em (Bass)
Not an 808 (Bass) They want that free (Bass)
The fiends want (Bass) So I feed 'em (Bass)
Not an 808 (Bass) They want that free (Bass)

[Verse Two: Nick Shades]
My nigga Crack unleashed a G to change the game man
So I'm a drop this gem to let these rappers know it's time to change they gameplan
Supply the bass 'cause I'm the flame man
The catalyst to spark you for it's visions make you use this thing more passionate
Paper advocate dog ain't it crazy hop through many acts of savage sacrilege
I got the sand man let it go from all the bad I did
Then come up on a thing of sacrament
That's an omen so your boy on Terror Squad ain't no accident
Cannabis got me chasin after mo' bread
Young nigga 20 with the knowledge of an old head
Infrared beams get your dome fed
Pass lucks for actin up, watch you fade away for not backin up
I crack a dutch every hour on the dot
When my menu is we plot, more methods of collectin to the day I cop the spot
On an island with a model that can't stand to wear a top
I'm a hustler 'til I drop

[Chorus: Fat Joe] (Sample)
The fiends want (Bass) So I feed 'em (Bass)
Not an 808 (Bass) They want that free (Bass)
The fiends want (Bass) So I feed 'em (Bass)
Not an 808 (Bass) They want that free (Bass)
The fiends want (Bass) So I feed 'em (Bass)
Not an 808 (Bass) They want that free (Bass)
The fiends want (Bass) So I feed 'em (Bass)
Not an 808 (Bass) They want that free (Bass)
