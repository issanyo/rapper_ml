Ok, from here on, nothing goes down unless I'm involved
No blackjack no dope deals, no nothing
A nickel bag gets sold in the park, I want in
You guys got fat while everybody starved on the street
It's my turn

[Frank White]
If any of you are tired of getting ripped off by guys like that... You come with me. I'm at the Plaza Hotel
You're welcome. You're all welcome!
