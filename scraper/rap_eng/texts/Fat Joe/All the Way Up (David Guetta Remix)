[Intro: Infared]
David Guetta, Fat Joe
Remy Ma, I'm all the way up

[Hook: Infared]
Nothing can stop me, I'm all the way up
All the way up
I'm all the way up, I'm all the way up
Nothing can stop me, I'm all the way up

[Bridge: French Montana]
Shorty what you want? Shorty what you need?
My niggas run the game, we ain't ever leavin'
Countin' up this money, we ain't never sleepin'
You got V12, I got 12 V's
Got bottles, got weed, got molly
Shorty what you want? I got what you need

[Hook: Infared]
I'm all the way up
Nothing can stop me, I'm all the way up
Nothing can stop me, I'm all the way up
Nothing can stop me, I'm all the way up
Nothing can stop me, I'm all the way up
Nothing can stop me, I'm all the way up
All the way up, all the way up
All the way up
Nothing can stop me, I'm all the way up

[Verse: Remy Ma]
Just left a big house to a bigger house
Ain't have a girlfriend but the bitch is out
Chanel, Prada bags, shit ain't even out
With the gold chains, and the linging, Birk, and cocaine
Lit it up, Pac shit, I hit 'em up
You talking colour money, purple in and blue derm
I got brown in here, I ain't talking 'bout Ross bitch
I'm that nigga on Viagra dick, that means I'm all the way up

[Bridge: French Montana]
Shorty what you want? I got what you need

[Hook: Infared]
I'm all the way up
Nothing can stop me, I'm all the way up
Nothing can stop me, I'm all the way up
Nothing can stop me, I'm all the way up
Nothing can stop me, I'm all the way up
Nothing can stop me, I'm all the way up
