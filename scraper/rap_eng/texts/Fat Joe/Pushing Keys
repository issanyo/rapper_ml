[Verse 1: Fat Joe]
Yeah, uhh
(Mark Henry...) yeah
My niggas murder for recreation and that's a fact
Get off your ass little niggas, learn to sling a pack
Get money, fuck bitches, ain't no leavin' that
Back from Africa, ain't no Prince Hakeem in that
Just crack with a taste of bakin' soda
(?) lines of fiends down the place they fuckin' order
Lookin' at my (?), it's about that time
Lookin' out at my Maybach, my seats recline
Paper over pussy bitch, imagine a mall
Been around the globe carryin' Louie Vuitton
Tote enough chrome to turn this bitch to Vietnam
Brought the devil with me, tell him sound the three alarm
Got a bitch in Houston, call me Joey Crack the Don
Mexico mami, fucked her right on that futon
(?) whiter than the cast of Happy Days
Bullets hit you harder than a note from Isaac Hayes, cause

[Chorus: Fat Joe]
Pushin' keys is a necessary means, ask Alicia
Fiends'll scream ya name from overseas
Way out there in Belize, got a plug and he sittin' on (?)
Waitin' on the Don he wish to be

Pushin' keys is a necessary means, ask Alicia
Fiends'll scream ya name from overseas
Way out there in Belize, got a plug and he sittin' on (?)
Waitin' on the Don he wish to be

[Verse 2: Fat Joe]
Chanel slippers, Chanel's a stripper
I creamed on her, watch you other rappers hug and kiss her
While I'm plottin' on some land to drop another villa
You sittin' on the stand, I thought you was some type of killer
Snitch nigga, you's a snitch nigga
The whole BX know it dog, you's a snitch nigga
Cuban cigar, (?) a bald head bitch
Think she Amber Rose, I just fuck her, I don't propose
No bullshit, meanin' no Derrick Rose
Laughin' at the Cavaliers, losin' 24
'member they used to pose, it was all good a week ago
We on the woods, watchin' Stoudemire free throws
Let the weed smoke, fill the air
Here's the answer to the question, is he still in here?
Here's some bullets through the cradle of ya baby's crib
Here's to coca baby, made a nigga crazy rich, 'cause

[Chorus: Fat Joe]
Pushin' keys is a necessary means, ask Alicia
Fiends'll scream ya name from overseas
Way out there in Belize, got a plug and he sittin' on (?)
Waitin' on the Don he wish to be

Pushin' keys is a necessary means, ask Alicia
Fiends'll scream ya name from overseas
Way out there in Belize, got a plug and he sittin' on (?)
Waitin' on the Don he wish to be
