Feat Tyga & Fat Joe

More money no problems, hard night long beating like a piñata
I tell my baby I love her, I see you mañana
I know it was hard, but I’m busy out get in Dollars 
Fresh out the dealer, dolla my baby shit killer, I got the root for the squillers for where its realler
Be ex girls, be K to LA, grab your friend tell her holla at CJ

Hard to ignore that body specially the way you put it out there girl im right here, why u working that titty babe
You’re about to hurt somebody
It’s so easy to enjoy you
Girl I’ve been a fool to let you go

I want to spend my whole night with you
Baby girl I’m with you to get you out my head

Chorus:
Baby I wanna get you out off your clothes, into my bed
Baby that’s only if you’re ready, uhh it’s getting heavy slamming the door so bring your body right here
I’ll make you love it if you let me
Uhh it’s getting heavy, girl
It’s so hard, yeahh

Not to wanna make love all night
When it feel so right, girl it’s so hard

For me to fight this feeling, specially the way you put them lips out, got them hips out how I keep from going crazy, baby
I just wanna get to behind yeah
Baby you know you got that work, yeah

Chorus:
Baby I wanna get you out off your clothes, into my bed
Baby that’s only if you’re ready, uhh it’s getting heavy slamming the door so bring your body right here
I’ll make you love it if you let me
Uhh it’s getting heavy, girl
It’s so hard, yeahh
Not to wanna make love all night
When it feel so right, girl it’s so hard

Think about you every day, this memory of you never fades, its on girl, its on girl, its getting heavy, heavy
See I’m already trusting you in my mind
When I really gotta waste no time tonight, no baby
Its getting heavy, heavy, heeey

You’re catching me in my cherry red, Lamborghini, me and habibi down the shores of Fiji, eating sushimi and some seaweed with my litte remi
Clance is exceptional, cannes hit the festival, france for romance, im the man with the sexual, rollin with the squad, we like ‘aahh’ , check’em in’em hot cars with brabs mini minaj, in Miami, I just want to settle, make a family, shawty from the A never plan B, gotta understand me, why she plain hard? All bossin me, the stand keep’em company like harbor, tucking that backwards, listen that oprah, even if I stuttered man, I t-t-t-told ya, I go hard!

[Chorus:]
I wanna get you out off your clothes, into my bed
Baby that’s only if you’re ready, uhh it’s getting heavy slamming the door so bring your body right here
I’ll make you love it if you let me
Uhh it’s getting heavy, girl
It’s so hard, yeahh
Not to wanna make love all night
When it feel so right, girl it’s so hard
