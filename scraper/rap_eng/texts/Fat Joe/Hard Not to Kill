[1st Verse]
Let me talk to these niggas
I fought with these niggas
Been in court for these niggas
These is my niggas
I never once count the chart figures
Never blamed y'all when shit came up missing
Naw, Plus You's a live wire
Caught beef aver you niggas in Elmira
Stood next to y'all while you was on fire
Nigga's tried to kill us everyday but we some riders
Right - where did we go wrong
You stayed in the streets I switched to rap songs
You blazin' your heat I'm reppin' the Bronx
Got caught in the sweep
I'm payin your bond
Shit, I'd a done it ten times
Next thing I know I hear you talking out of line
Like, This ain't love
This is extortion
Joey know better I put 'em in a coffin
Shit, I had to take a deep breath
This shit about to get real crazy in the X
Man I have them run up on ya
I'll wait a couple years you'll be on that same corner

[Hook: repeat 2X]
Kind of hard not to kill niggas
Like a full time job not to kill niggas
Oh yeah
This shit is realer then you think
For my respect I do years in the bink

[2nd Verse]
Been in the game for the minute
I'm making moves
I switch careers
I make them movies
Got TV shows that's reppin' the Bronx
I'm spitting Spanish
I'm Viva Reggetone, niggas
Oh yeah I'm ready for war
Any body hard body
Just my four four
I mean Cracks that niggas
I'll smack that Nigga
I'll yap that Nigga
Gun clap that Nigga
Oh yeah I spit that shit
Motivate young bucks how to flip them bricks
Showed you how to jump off and switch the fifth
And this all the mo'fucking thanks I get
Shit, I'm just being polite
I'm married to this rap shit but the streets my life
Matter of fact I
