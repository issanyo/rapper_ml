[Intro]
Crack, nigga!
Darkside, uhh
(Mark Henry)

[Verse]
We live a life and it's off the wall
Straight jacket and I'm leanin' off of Propofol
You niggas sleepin', I'm as dope as y'all
Even better I would dead ya if there's coke involved
A hundred guns up in the stash crib (yeah)
Two bad bitches on my mattress
The strip pole's by the basement
Same place I had Maliah do the Matrix
We out in Vegas at the Floyd fight
Boeing business, just a joy ride
And boy I tell you we enjoy life
Slid the gates and copped some more ice
9-11, and the Porsche is drop
We blow religious like we orthodox
Is there a heaven for a G, man?
Can we politic like this is C-span?
I don't wanna hear what he ran
Same niggas be floatin' up in the deep end
Cement shoes, no 3's bruh
'Cause we get it poppin', what it be's Blood?
Ya now rockin' with the Darkside
Part deux, another classic for the archive

[Outro]
Uhh, yeah, uhh
Darkside 2 niggas
Yeah, yeah
Uhh, Darkside nigga
Welcome to the Darkside, Crack
