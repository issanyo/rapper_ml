[Chorus: Bryson Tiller]
Where you come from girl
You got to be a prototype
Cause you love ain't

I love you to pieces
If I tell you
If I tell you
That's its real
Cause you love ain't normal
It's incredible

I love you to pieces

[Verse 1: Fat Joe]
Soulmates are like diamonds
You never can make them
You got to find them
And your beauty's  quite blinding
Its like staring at the sun on an island
And its always the little things
I could see your halo and pretty wings
Lemon crunch on your pinkberry
That's always she really wants
Got to thank Mary
Foreplay but its so long
Just enjoy the ride
Mama hold on
And your loves the sweetest
Your the pieces to my puzzle
I love you to pieces

[Chorus]
Where you come from girl
You got to be a prototype
Cause you love ain't normal
It's incredible

I love you to pieces
If I tell you
If I tell you
That's its real
Cause you love ain't normal
It's incredible
I love you to pieces

[Verse 2: Fat Joe]
Twenty-four karat gold edible icecream
Thats a thousand dollar sundae
Met her at Liv
Then I scooped her on Monday
Now thats a hundred-thousand dollar sunday
Berkin bags with the tri-colors
Thats just something I can't deny lovers
But this more than just fashion
Its like knowing without asking
Simple things like your feet rubs
Rose petals on the greek tub
Sign says slippery when wet
So I dives in no life vest

[Chorus]
Where you come from girl
You got to be a prototype
Cause you love ain't normal
It's incredible

I love you to pieces
If I tell you
If I tell you
That's its real
Cause you love ain't normal
It's incredible

I love you to pieces

[Verse 3: Fat Joe]
Caramel skin
Hair to her waistline
Porcelin grin
Every kiss like a taste wine
I know true love takes time
If you need a heart
You can take mine
Know you're beautiful
Girl you're beautiful
Things I'd do to you
Things I'd do for you
Cause your loves the sweetest
Your the pieces to my puzzle
I love you to pieces

[Chorus]
Where you come from girl
You got to be a prototype
Cause you love ain't normal
It's incredible

I love you to pieces
If I tell you
If I tell you
That's its real
Cause you love ain't normal
It's incredible

I love you to pieces
