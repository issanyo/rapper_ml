Hey, hey

Pair white nikes
Phantom top drop on that I nine five
Pink see suckers who but

Now I ain't gotta tell you
That them boys pop bottles
And mami's lookin like america's top model
She says your earing look at

Than the rock on my ring
Now she gotta man who plays for the hawks
I'm like cum on ma you know me run New York
Jays in the background put u to bed
Says she got brains so I'm looking ahead
And I'm looking for bread

Real niggas do real things
And I can keep a secret

Cause Baby you got it

[Fat Joe:]
A material girl
In a material world
Venus, Serina
Ma cereal girls
What you know about having dinner on a jet
Make it back before
The DJ's finished with his set
Now they call me the birdman
When them doors ajar
Ghost ride the whip like
I'm from Oakland ya'll
It's the crack man
And he ain't got a shot the don
The wrist is jacob earing chopard
Went to chows for chows out
Know it's da same thing
Bills so high
They throwing the champagne
I'm a real nigga real
Niggas do real things
And I can keep a secret
Is the song that I sing
Yaddamean

[Chorus]
Millionare frames perrier rocks
Every day a different chain

Name another fat guy that fly
Like me to get ya right laid pipe
All night like me

Yellow ones, sky blue the white bag

Red card black card I could buy that

I'm a real nigga real niggas do real things
And I can keep a secret

Yaddamean
