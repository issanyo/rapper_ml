[Fat Joe]
Yo, new millennium, Joey Crack the Don
Yo, yo, uh, yo when the song come on
I be long gone drunk off Sean
In the VIP where the dons belong
With a bad ass mami getting her party on
Taking shots of her body till Bacardi's gone
Caution dog, stay calm I mean no harm
You know the squad, Joe the Don
Be like show me your thong
No he ain't wrong
Crush to our favorite song
In the naked form, till the break of dawn, come on

[Guy]
Looking in your eyes
As we start to dance the night away
(Uh-huh, uh-huh)
I can feel your heart (Yeah)
As your pushing your body close to mine

2 - To the beat, to the drum
To the music till we're one
Don't you worry 'bout the crowd
Cause there's no one else around
I can freak it if you like
I can make you feel all right
I can serve it to you right
Cause I'd like to explore your body tonight

1 - I like to think that I'm the only one she sees
When we're dancing (dancing)
When we're out on the floor (out on the floor)
I like to think that she'll be coming home with me
So I slowly move closer
Let her know that I want her

Baby take my hand (Yeah)
And let me guide you to this dance of love
(We'll be moving so close)
Almost like we're making love
Baby, bring your body and let it bounce with me

Repeat 2

Repeat 1

[Cuban Linx]
Yo, yo, yo
I'm in the club thuggin' it out
Grabbin' my niggas puffin' an ounce
Guzzling down Henney, plenty honeys loving me now
Y'all know my style, wild out
Get drunk and jump in the crowd
Something about Cuban got women running, coming from miles
Ain't no doubt, one smile will have 'em floating on clouds
Throwin' around their panties
Talkin' 'bout how they wanna go out
Cause papi got 'em strung out, crushin' and turnin' 'em out
Ya better throw in the towel
Cause I last longer than trial

[Female](Guy)
Do you wanna dance with me?
(Yeah)
Do you wanna dance with me?
(Yeah)
I want you to, I want you
(And you know that I do)
Do you wanna dance with me?
(Yeah)
Do you wanna dance with me?
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
I want you to, I want you
(Yeah, yeah, yeah I do)

Repeat 1

[Guy]
Can I dance? Can I dance?
Can I dance with you?
Can I dance? Can I dance?
Can I dance with you?
Can I dance? Can I dance?
Can I dance with you?
So I slowly move closer
Let her know that I want her
