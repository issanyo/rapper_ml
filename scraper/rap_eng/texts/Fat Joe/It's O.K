[Intro]
Yeah, right about now
I'm about to slow it up
For that very special lady
I see you right there
But we about to smooth it out for you
Right now

Never, Hey, Hey, Hey, Hey, Hey, Hey!

[Hook]
It's okay, it's okay
It's okay, hey, we was home anyway
It's alright, it's alright
High, High, we was all more night

NIGGAS! Tryin to come in my
I'm talkin 'bout
NIGGAS! Tryin to come in my
Who? Who?
NIGGAS! Tryin to come in my home
Take my chrome, I say yo "It's On"
If my house, I-I been here(speakin spanish too)
Es me casa y yo viva aqui

[Verse 1]
Yeah, check me out now
The other day I was chillin
In the crib with two women
We just finished swimmin
Now I'm ready to slid up in 'em
They the horny type, bout to get it on
With the only dykes, now I hear the alarm
I'm like, "Holy Christ!"
Is somebody tryin to come up in my crib?
I'm like "Who the fuck is this?"
Like Notorious Big, he wore a black suit
With a black mask that match
I'm bout to blast his mask off
Push his cabbage back
Make spaghetti out his brain
Cuz I'm steady with the aim
Niggas comin sideways, gettin petty wit da game
Musta heard about the half in the safe
The stash in the base, iced out
Medals in the case
Niggas comin wit da chrome
Tryin to sneak up in my home, rumors out
I spent a Mil' on the pump piece alone
I got the heat in my palm
Nobody's seein it though
Step your feet on my lawn
I'm puttin 3 to ya dome!

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Yeah, verse 2, yo
Now I got these bitches
Screamin fo' they life
Peein on they nice
Gotta funny feelin that
They teamin on the heist
Scheemin on the ice
Won't get you nothin but killed
Front if you will, get chopped up
Stuffed in the quill
Back to the lab, got these niggas
After my math, these hoes try to play it off
But they captain is back
They must have teamed up
With some niggas thinkin they sweet
Like I just rapped and
I got a ho waitin in the street
I'm playin for keeps, I see 'em
Creepin on the moniters
Got my temperature risin faster than thermometers
I burn banana clips, make all
My victories unanimous
I'm accurate, once I catch a peak
Hey man, yo ass is hit!
Now I see 'em creepin through the front door
I think not! We exchange shots
Like cops into getting blocked{*gunshot*}
He busts, I bust back{*gunshot*}
He caught one in the chest
The other two got hit up
In the stomache and neck{*gunshots*}
I'm under the desk, freeloading
Puttin slugs in the rest
Wonderin what possessed these niggas
To come in my rest!{*gunshots*}

{*breathing hard*}
You motherfuckers want a war with me?
Dont you know I fuckin kill niggas?
Here I come!{*gunshots*}
Oh, shit! Motherfuckers is dead already!
Yo, where them bitches go?
