Yo This is going out to all my peeps locked down
Charlie Rock LD
All my peeps who passed away, yeah

[Verse 1]
I remember when we used to chill on a hill
When Forest Projects, used to be Godsville
Brothers was wilin, others was cool
Some hit the island, some smoked fools
Me I chose the life of crime since day one
13 years old, already trying to cop a gun
I never understood why my pops would beat me
No matter what I did, yo he'd still mistreat me
That's why I never listened to a thing he said
And I wasn't just mad when I used to wish him dead
Instead, me and Ma Dukes kept tight
Promised that one day everything would be alright
14 Years old, cutting mad classes
Puffing on a bone, breaking car glasses
Nothing but dreams of cream on my mind
Shook motherfuckers on the block droppin dime
Everybody knew Joey Crack represented
And if I told you that I’d take your life ayo I meant it’
Hey Yo, I meant it
That's the way it goes
When you deal with the real fake jacks
And get your cap peeled

[Chorus]
Hey Joey, let's just get this money
Brothas just be wilin
Hey Joey, you can't trust nobody
Brothas they been triflin

[Verser 2]
Yeah Momma never said life would be so hard
Sometimes I find myself alone just praying to god
Hoping that today won't be the last
I mean, Just the other day this kid I knew got blast
(Say Word) Word, it wasn't over no cash
It was over some broad who liked to auction off the ass
He was a cool kid, although we lost him big
If he was a real nigga, then he wouldn't have got did
Life's trife, and then you die
Nobody dies of old age, but in the hands of another guy
That's why I keeps an alibi
Giuliani wants to see a brother fry
So I maintain to keep my mind peace focused
Keep the gat near in case a nigga wanna smoke this
Times are difficult on the streets of New York
It’s kinda hard trying to hold fort and not get caught
Blue eyes is on my back with intentions of arresting me
But they won't get the best of me
Cause riches are my destiny

[Chorus]
Hey Joey, let's just get this money
Brothas just be wilin
Hey Joey, you can't trust nobody
Brothas they been triflin

[Verse 3]
No one expected me to blow like this
What was once hand me downs
Is now the best of Antonovich
Yukon Jeeps creepin through the streets
Catching the eye of every big booty cheek freak
Dayton rims so shiny you can see your reflection
Green plush interior, under the seat
The heat for protection
Momma look at me now
Got a house in Long Isle for my spouse and my child
DL condos for first impression hoes
No more holes in my gibros
Strictly tailor-made clothes
Airwaves blasting my latest single
All up in the Mecca Club
Making Lucci while I mingle
Jingle jewels in the face of past enemies
Eat your heart out son, you never was a friend to me

[Chorus]
Hey Joey, let's just get this money
Brothas just be wilin
Hey Joey, you can't trust nobody
Brothas they been triflin

Big Joe, South Bronx
