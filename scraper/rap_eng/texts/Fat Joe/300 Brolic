Taurus Raging Bull, about the size of my arm
See the size of the charm make your wife leave your arm
That's right, I fight, I done been in brawls
I done did some things that made some killers shit they drawers
I done been on boats in Columbia shipping raw and
I done ripped up plenty of stages with Biggie Smalls
Oh shit, wait a minute, I done did it all
Poor righteous teacher I'm featured on final call
Hustle I'm a Laker man yes yes y'all
And Pun already told you that we ready for war
Quit playing, hit mayne, blood stains on the wall
Shit mayne, his brains, your remains on the floor

Stuff em in your mouth where them lil shits belong

We want war

Just when you thought it was
Safe to turn the corner I
Had to run up on him like blat! now he's gone
Just when you thought it was
Safe to turn the corner I
Had to run up on him like blat! now he's gone

[Singing]:
We want war
We love war
We need war
We want war

Just when you thought it was
Safe to turn the corner I
Had to run up on him like blat! now he's gone
Just when you thought it was
Safe to turn the corner I
Had to run up on him like blat! now he's gone
