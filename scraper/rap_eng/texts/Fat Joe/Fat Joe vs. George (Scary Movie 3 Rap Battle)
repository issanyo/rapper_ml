[Fat Joe]
These guys can't be serious right here
Stan and Mini-Me
A.K.A. I hope he ain't
The one you fight with

Hey, yo
This nigga's mad corny
And ain't got no skills
Cause he's all right, but he's not real
Don't mean to hurt your feelings, but you'll never get a deal
Cause he's all right, but he's not real
You're a needle in a haystack
I'm the don the city slicker
Forget cows and milk your moms
Her titties give ya
That elixir
Thought he wasn't?
Bet this nigga end up having kids with his cousin
Half-retarded
My number-one fan be like
(Stammers)
That means Fat Joe's the man
You're a liar in denial
Kill your ass quicker
Than I died in "Empire"
How dare you want to joust with me?
Looking like you dying of SARS or mad cow disease
You fake B-Rabbit
Out to battle me
Eight miles down the road
The farm's that away

Now everybody in the 202
Throw your hands in the air cause Fat Joe is screwed
Now everybody in the 202
Throw 'em up
Check it out

I'm a white boy
But my neck is red
I put Miracle Whip
On my Wonder Bread
My face is pale
Nah, I've never been in jail
Me and Buffy spend every winter at Vail
How many bitches have I slapped?
Zero, unh
And Martha Stewart happens to be my hero
I grew up on a farm and I was born with no rhythm
Dr. Phil's my uncle and I like to hang with him
I can't dance
I wear khaki pants
My middle name's Lance
My grandma's from France
So maybe I'm wack
Cause my skin ain't black
But you can't talk smack
Cause whitey just struck back
