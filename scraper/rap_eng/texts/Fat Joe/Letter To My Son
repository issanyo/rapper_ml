[Intro (Sampled)]
You took away the sound
The touch, the smell, my sight
To see your smile

[Verse 1: Don Trip]
Please, no pity for a G
Though I got a son that I barely get to see
I see him for a hour, after that he gotta leave
On top of that, I only get to see him once a week
Yeah, right, lucky me
Well fuck Keltra Pope and whoever disagree
I learned a valuable lesson indeed
But I'm just tryna be the best father I could be
Apparently I'm an unfit father
'Cause all I know is dope and all I got is dirty dollars
But I'm selling dope to help my family get farther
'Cause no nine-to-five is gon' prevent us from starving
I'm sorry Jaylin, I don't get to see you like I want to
But I just wanna let you know I want to
If the court grant me visitation then I'm goin' to
But you too young to understand what we're goin' through
And your mama's low down
She's just doing everything to hurt me right now
Why? 'Cause I don't love her like I used to
So to get back at me she knows she gotta use you
And I don't know what else to do
She don't understand that this shit will bruise you too
And now I gotta take the bitch to court
So either way, it's a lose - lose

[Chorus: CeeLo Green]
I'm writin' a letter to my baby
I'm writin a letter to my son
Tell 'em things done got too crazy
But it's not over, it's not done
I told your mama I don't love her
It made her trip and now she gone
So I'ma be the bad one
I'ma be the bad one, but I just wanna see my son

[Verse 2: Don Trip]
I tried talkin' to the bitch
But she keep using you as a bargainin' chip
And I am not the one to be bargainin' wit'
That just make me wanna go and put my paws on that bitch
I swear this shit ain't even right, bruh
I ain't even got a chance to change your fucking diaper
This is what I get for going raw when I piped her
Thinkin' that I loved her when I shouldn't have even like her
But I do not regret my child
Stupid bitch, I just wan' see my child
Do what you may, but you will never make me bow
Fuck child support, bitch, take me to trial!
Why you with this shit? 'Cause I ain't read you no vows?
Bitch, move on, me and you ain't workin' out
So what it matter if I moved to work out?
'Long as I provide and put food in his mouth

[Chorus: CeeLo Green]
I'm writin' a letter to my baby
I'm writin a letter to my son
Tell 'em things done got too crazy
But it's not over, it's not done
I told your mama I don't love her
It made her trip and now she gone
So I'ma be the bad one
I'ma be the bad one, but I just wanna see my son

[Verse 3: Don Trip]
Matter fact, I'm in school right now
'Case the music don't work and I can put the work down
My momma say this shit sure to work out
All the bullshit I'm going through to see my first child
See his first steps, see his first smile
Hear his first words, teach him how to count
But I guess I been counted out
Seein' as the bitch don't want me around
When I speak to him he don't recognize the sound
The sound of my voice, so he just looks around
I know she enjoys, so I suck it up and smile
But fuck the stupid bitch, I just wan' see my child

[Chorus: CeeLo Green]
I'm writin' a letter to my baby
I'm writin a letter to my son
Tell 'em things done got too crazy
But it's not over, it's not done
I told your mama I don't love her
It made her trip and now she gone
So I'ma be the bad one
I'ma be the bad one, but I just wanna see my son
