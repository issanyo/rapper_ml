Yeah, uh!
Fuck these hoes
Fuck these bitches
Fuck these bitch ass niggas, you heard me?
(Crap)
I'm talkin' money over bitches fuck a love song
I be the...in your home jus you don't know
This is the opposite of darkside, (Yeah!) the don's home
Baby catch a flight, reignite now we long gone
Now I don't want 'em, I don't trust 'em, I don't love 'em, I just fuck 'em, I just bun 'em
I be ... these hoes, nigga
Know I'm sayin'? I'm just playin, I be slayin', they ain't stand, kick 'em out
Yeah I can come for these hoes, nigga
There's always money over, a nigga never sober and lately these bitches they prison me like I'm Jahova
I'm loyal to the paper, when it calls I gotta leave, rushin' out the crib and I'm movin' Lamborghini speed
We in them Cali hills, sittin' on a hundred mill, drinkin' on these tricks I couldn't tell ya niggas how that feels
How we...down, I ain't payin' no deal
These bitch ass niggas gettin' done up cus I'm so real
Duffle bags, fill up, blow it all, just to get a thrill
Jumpin' in the ocean with my ice
