[Intro]
Darkside!
You know it mean more to me when a nigga really live them lyrics you know!
Yeah! I mean like when I listen to a nigga I be like yeah I remember
Uh-Hah! I don't really remember them niggas, puttin it down like that

[Verse 1: Fat Joe]
Wonder why the flow retarded
Cause the shit we author authentic
More realer than you fake niggas pretendin'
Uh! Late night long drives our main agenda
Get money fuck every bitch before we end up
Dead in the pine box make sure it's a hundred thousand
I grew up in public housin', boilin' crack in water fountains
Youngin on the park bench fantasizin'
Same spot he got shot and they can't revive him
Darkside is a tail of addictions
Turn your moms into a fiend cause you addicted to pitchin'
Uh! You gotta get the cuban three kilos
Giovanci the heat's on me
Got knocked turned quiet bet ya sing off key
Nah man I stay Cool like D.R.E
Living rooms with swimming pools filled with P.Y.T.'s
Fresh pair of J's and some PRPS you know

[Interlude]
Yeah! Uh!

[Verse 2: Fat Joe]
Just me and my bitch, in the two seater
Mink floor in the wind, that'll move PETA
Get me a pot and a stove and I could move pieces
Thirty six of them o's I bought a Mona Lisa
Got more white chicks than a sorority house
While Fox News quick to point minorities out
I got a Mexicana chick, bad Dominicana
Pointed her out the crowd and her son's a punta cana
Put her in some pumps and designer Chanels
She got a pussy wet enough to douse the fires in hell
Got the iron on my seat and I pull up blastin'
9th Wonder on the beat and it's a fuckin' classic

[Outro]
Uh! Yeah! I wanna shoutout my brother Brent T.A.T
Bio, Nice and B.G. Shoutout to Shane 125th!
Uh! Cope 2 I see you, forever king!
