Its the illness going on
Yo Shatek hit me
Y-Young
Youngn' Restless
Joe Crack
Strong Armin', T.S
Patterson, B-X
Hold UP!

[Hook]
Boy, look what you done started now
Ain't no stopping this or calming it down
Don't let me catch one of you fools out of bounds
Heart is cold, be in war from the motherfucking cradle to the grave
Man, look what you done started now
Ain't no stopping this or calming it down
Don't let me catch one of you fools out of bounds
Heart is cold, be in war from the motherfucking cradle to the grave

[Verse 1]
Cowards en traced all this anger and hatred
Gon' make me damage abrasion my attitude is very impatient
Nigga crossed me, first thing I wanna do is erase him
Yea he used to be my dog, but fuck a relation
Once he get money and fame, everybody starts aging
Shit ain't no longer the same, your own niggas be hatin'
Can't see another brother succeed
So you backstab 'em just to see how long he'll bleed
But I'm a strong man, pops always told me never fear no man
That's why I'm scarred up on both hands
And never love a bitch, hell naw I can't trust a bitch
Fuck 'em and leave 'em, that's the way you thug a bitch
It's how a nigga was raised, with a heart full of rage
And I'm just too stuck in my ways (You hear me?)
Its how a nigga was raised, with a heart full of rage
And I'm just too stuck in my ways (So fuck y'all)

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Dog I came here to prove your wackness
Bunch of useless bastards always frontin', moving backwards
This is hardcore, ain't no acoustic classic
Nigga swift for anything reserving using a ratchet
Competition stand 'em in line, cause without permission
I'm handling mine, occupation scramble and grind
Stop your facing, shank you with knives
You're missing a born soldier, operation declined
I'm like a optician, with a vision to shine
A hundred steps ahead of y'all, ain't no getting behind
Say what I choose cause I done payed my dues
Came from an error of pain and terror, alot of rainy weather
I learned to survive through the hatred and lies
That's why from far away, I can spot a snake in disguise
And believe me dog we ain't scared, hope you came prepared
Straight Strong-Armin, nigga we don't play fair

[Hook]

[Verse 3 - Fat Joe]
B-X, T.S
Ya heard me?
Youngn' Rest
Uh, yo, yo
Gear up, you need to fear us
One false move and get paw-pierced up
Drinking like one high loop, man I bang you in the club
Drain the henny out your stomach and replace it with blood
You wish us to hell cause we too real
Selling two mills and still ain't afraid to pull steal
Ready Rock ain't concerned with y'all
I'm too big too strong for y'all
And I came too long for y'all, ya heard Pun
Takes years to earn a pair of Terror Squad balls
Heard you niggas want it with us, a fatal mistake
Been blazing the game since niggas fourth-aides
Crack is king, man the city is mine
And I ain't got no problem with bidding with +Shyne+
Here's the real deal homie, stakes is high
Look at the mirror man I bet you hate your life (Mu'fucker)

[Hook]
