Last night
I had this feelin'
When we were making love
It felt so right
You had me screamin'
There's no one above

*Oh you and I
Will always be together
Love don't lie
Our love will last forever
I'm so high
And I'm hooked on you
And I don't know what to do
You're so good you're gifted
And I get lifted

I get lifted
You're making me high
Whenever you're around baby
Lifted, I get lifted
I touch the sky
Whenever we ??? Don't stop
It gets me excited
When you make the first move
You won't doubt
That's just the way I like it
So please don't lose this groove
*Oh you and I
Will always be together
Love don't lie
This love will last forever
And I'm so high
And I'm hooked on you
And I don't know what to do
You're so good you're gifted
And I get lifted

Whenever you're around my baby
Lifted, I get lifted
You make me so so happy
Baby yeah baby yeah, lifted
You're making me so damn high, yeah
Lifted, I get lifted
Come on over here and stay awhile
I'm high (lifted) Come on baby

You're love takes me higher
Higher and higher, lifted
(repeat *)
