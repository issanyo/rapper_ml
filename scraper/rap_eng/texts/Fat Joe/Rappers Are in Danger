[Chorus]
Rap, rap, rap rappers are in danger
Rap, rap, rap rappers are in danger
Rap, rap, rap rappers are in danger
Rap, rap, rap rappers are in danger
Rap, rap, rap rappers are in danger
Rap, rap, rap rappers are in danger
Rap, rap, rap rappers are in danger
Rap, rap, rap rappers are in danger

[Verse 1]
It's the Darkside, yeah, uhh
Welcome to the Darkside, yo
You got a problem motherfucker then holla
All you seen was the batter
No LeBron, when I pop bring them flowers
Run up in your labels beat your head with them plaques
Better watch what you speak on them raps
Nigga I am cocaine, I am extortion
We are the streets, yes we are inforcing
Time to take the gloves off
Mask off, hit 'em with the Mossberg
Splashing, blast first, baby guts, black hearse
You niggas ain't ready for ready
Wanna talk saucy turn your fucking head to spaghetti
All you young boys, I got 16 in
You can kill and shoot the booth up and still can't win
Nigga left me for dead try to
Kick to the curb, 'til them C and B
Boys came and put in the word
Now it's, more Maybachs, more Phantom drops
Ball 'til we fall, 'til the judge let the hammer drop

[Chorus]
Rap, rap, rap rappers are in danger
Ya now rocking with the Darkside
Rap, rap, rap rappers are in danger
Ya now rocking with the Darkside
Rap, rap, rap rappers are in danger
Ya now rocking with the Darkside
Rap, rap, rap rappers are in danger
Ya now rocking with the Darkside
Rap, rap, rap rappers are in danger
Ya now rocking with the Darkside
Rap, rap, rap rappers are in danger
Ya now rocking with the Darkside
Rap, rap, rap rappers are in danger
Ya now rocking with the Darkside
Rap, rap, rap rappers are in danger
Ya now rocking with the Darkside

[Verse 2]
Champagne dreams
Cashmere nightmares
Nigga couldn't touch my flow
Not in light years
This Is It like the best of the Mike years
You niggas more pussy
Than dykes here
Yeah, in that (?) pearl
With a chick with a fatter ass then Kanye's girl, shit
Either (?)
In the streets is where you find me
The same hood they suppose to let Shyne be
This is that block music
Go 'head and bust a shot music
Bag it up, hustle rocks, fuck the cops music
Yeah, ya now rockin with the Darkside
No love, so you know a nigga heart cry
Bet I still be on top, when them cars fly
Even then man, I still let the sparks fly
Lot of niggas turn their dicks into a slit
Sit down and pee niggas
Now ain't that bitch

[Chorus]
Rap, rap, rap rappers are in danger
Ya now rocking with the Darkside
Rap, rap, rap rappers are in danger
Ya now rocking with the Darkside
Rap, rap, rap rappers are in danger
Ya now rocking with the Darkside
Rap, rap, rap rappers are in danger
Ya now rocking with the Darkside
Rap, rap, rap rappers are in danger
Ya now rocking with the Darkside
Rap, rap, rap rappers are in danger
Ya now rocking with the Darkside
Rap, rap, rap rappers are in danger
Ya now rocking with the Darkside
Rap, rap, rap rappers are in danger
Ya now rocking with the Darkside
