Hazardous
Must me killer, ay
Woo, woo

[Chorus: Fat Joe & N.O.R.E.]
Bendicion, pay homage to the real one
A hot one, you don't wanna feel one
Diga bendicion
They always honored by my presence
Act right, I'm always being present
Dame diga bendicion
Bendicion, bendicion
Bendicion, bendicion
Diga bendicion

[Verse 1: Fat Joe & N.O.R.E.]
Jose Luis shot ya, holding guns with duns
I used to lean back, all the way up with my sons
Niggas foul disrespectin', what they thinkin'
Move a little work now, now he think he kingpin (uh)
Tryna front, clap niggas, that's the end of story (what)
Told the soldiers hold the work, just another second for me
I'm straight low when I'm firin'
See U-P-S, heard that they was hirin'

[Chorus: Fat Joe & N.O.R.E.]
Bendicion, pay homage to the real one
A hot one, you don't wanna feel one
Diga bendicion
They always honored by my presence
Act right, I'm always being present
Dame diga bendicion
Bendicion, bendicion
Bendicion, bendicion
Diga bendicion

[Verse 2: Fat Joe & N.O.R.E.]
These niggas said we was banned from Puerto Rico (where you heard that)
When I was in La Perla, Puerto Rico
I was in Lo√≠za too
They ain't want no beef with you
Pa'lante mi gente we Puerto Ricans too
La Isla Bonita the flow is Fahrenheit
How my shit is so fire, I'm wearing all this ice
LeBron James to the Lakers, I thought you ought a know
We love all of our people, we wanted y'all to know

[Chorus: Fat Joe & N.O.R.E.]
Bendicion, pay homage to the real one
A hot one, you don't wanna feel one
Diga bendicion
They always honored by my presence
Act right, I'm always being present
Dame diga bendicion
Bendicion, bendicion
Bendicion, bendicion
Diga bendicion
Bendicion, bendicion
Bendicion, bendicion
Diga bendicion
