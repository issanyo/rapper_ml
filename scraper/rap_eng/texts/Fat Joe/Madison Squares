[Intro]
Yeah! Uh! What we sellin is a vibe you know
Get money shit! Uh!

[Verse One]
Another day awaken, thank God that I made it
Egg white omelet, slice of turkey bacon
Got that ass to push up, pull them panties to the side
Boy she love to hook up, couple bitches on the side
Then we jump in the shower Medusa faces on towels
I been ballin like D. Wade same jacket with flowers
I inspired the bosses ballers the streets name me Don
I arrive from bustin macks movin packs of heroin

[Chorus]
Call it Madison Squares, movin ye in the hood
Now we in Madison Square, fresh J's on the wood
You know! Yeah! We call it Madison Square!

[Verse Two]
Menu order see us, ringside 'cause we re-up
Dropped a hundred racks aww, damn he God see us
Speakin lingos that's foreign, man he got no imported
Handle ones that afford it, be the ones there to snort it
I'm missin James Gandolfini, we eat spaghetti with lobster
Conversatin 'bout life, yeah he respected this mobster
And the villa is packed, pussy poppin in spandex
But that ass is a killer I'm talkin Aaron Hernandez
I think about boss in charge, when I look at my daughter
Now we throwin tea parties I'm dippin coke in the water
We call it Madison Squares, movin ye in the hood
Now we in Madison Square, fresh J's on the wood
You know!

[Outro]
Uh! Yeah! We call it Madison Square
Those who afford it be the ones there to snort it
Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha! Madison Square
WOO! Uh! Shoutout my nigga Big Mach, shoutout Illa! Cool And Dre on this one nigga!
Madison Squares! Ah!
