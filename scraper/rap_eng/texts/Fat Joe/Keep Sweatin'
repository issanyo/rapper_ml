Pullin' up to the club
Six coke dealers in my truck
Sliding to V.I. room
Hypnotic is in my cup
Then I felt someone grab me
And say, "Ain't you from Cali?"
Then say, "Welcome to Miami"
Yeah, she was on me heavy
So I brushed up, like, "Wassup?"
So her jeans was tight as what
I say next, she made me step
Back a minute, she was wet
By then I was so ready
She got my tank top so sweaty
Tossed her up like Machiavelli
And yeah, she was on me heavy
Ooh, keep sweatin'
Uh uh, keep sweatin'
Ooh, I'm sweatin'
It's so hot, I'm sweatin'
Ooh, well you really don't stop
Do what you do, till your body's hot
Back it on up to the wall then drop
Ooh, now take it to the top
Now push it back, push it back, push it back, baby
Now push it back, push it back, push it back, oh
Push it back, push it back, uh
Push it back, push it back, uh
Come on
3 a.m., club is packed
Sure by now she's feelin' that
I might go and take her home
Yeah, she knew, I made it known
Sweat drippin' down her face
Took my mind to a different place
Club was cool if I had my way
Yeah, we'd be at my place
Crazy how, she was down
Looked at me and said, "Let's bounce"
GT Coupe in velor
Looked at her and said, "Swell huh?"
Then we started to roll out
Almost to my crib and she's down
For whatever, you know I'm down
Yeah, she'll be sweatin' for me now, come on
Ooh, keep sweatin'
Uh uh, keep sweatin'
Ooh, I'm sweatin'
It's so hot, I'm sweatin'
Ooh, well you really don't stop
Do what you do, till your body's hot
Back it on up to the wall then drop
Ooh, now take it to the top
Now push it back, push it back, push it back, baby
Now push it back, push it back, push it back, oh
Push it back, push it back, uh
Push it back, push it back, uh
Come on
Woke up in the mornin' and I washed my face
Had hoochies on the bed three by the fireplace
Another four on the rug and they keepin' on touch
Everybody do the snake when they fuckin' wit us
Now, chicks love me well, at least they say so
Or maybe it's the money or the sweet [Incomprehensible]
See, I don't give a fuck, I just leave and replace hoes
And everyone's a player but believe me, they ain't Joe
Stains on my shirt and it's not from that club
Ray J, don't know how to act you can
If you feel me, we can rock away
I just wanna make ya sweat, y'all feel me
Right around the world from east to west coasts
Gonna make sure y'all go home and change clothes
But now we just want your clothes to be soaked
And if you can't take it undress on the dance floor
Ooh, keep sweatin'
Uh uh, keep sweatin'
Ooh, I'm sweatin'
It's so hot, I'm sweatin'
Ooh, well you really don't stop
Do what you do, till your body's hot
Back it on up to the wall then drop
Ooh, now take it to the top
Ooh, keep sweatin'
Uh uh, keep sweatin'
Ooh, I'm sweatin'
It's so hot, I'm sweatin'
Ooh, well you really don't stop
Do what you do, till your body's hot
Back it on up to the wall then drop
Ooh, now take it to the top
Now push it back, push it back, push it back, baby
Now push it back, push it back, push it back, oh
Push it back, push it back, uh
Push it back, push it back, uh
Come on, uh
Now push it back, push it back, push it back, baby
Now push it back, push it back, push it back, oh

Push it back, push it back, uh
Come on
