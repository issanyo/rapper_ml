[Intro]
Mark Henry...
Yeah, it's like
We got a lot of frauds in the game Dre
Lot of niggas guilty by association
It's Crack, nigga!
Darkside...

[Verse 1]
Yo, yeah
Jumpin' out of helicopters
Stickin' to the script, no teleprompters
Air Jordans never Reeboks
Darkside, anticipated like Detox
Never beef in an interview
Fuck a radio, bullets flyin' into you
Baby girl I'm into group sex
I'm fuckin' actresses and divas, who's next?
No love for the other side
Two dead bodies, no homi, call it double side
Panamera with the bubble eyes
Cop new whips when the bubble rise
Too much autos need a parkin' lot
Had to dead the last chick 'cause she talk a lot
Couldn't hear a sound when I silenced her
100 rounds out the motherfuckin' silencer

[Chorus]
Fuck them other niggas
'cause I ride for my niggas, I, die for my niggas
Yeah, fuck them other niggas
Fuck them other niggas
'cause I ride for my niggas, I, die for my niggas
Yeah, fuck them other niggas
Fuck them other niggas
'cause I ride for my niggas, I, die for my niggas
Yeah, fuck them other niggas
Fuck them other niggas
'cause I ride for my niggas, I, die for my niggas
Yeah, fuck them other niggas

[Verse 2]
Yeah...
Put her on a private jet
Pussy killer, I ain't met a bitch survive me yet
Most wanted, hoes I dick 'em down
Take 'em shoppin' for the thrills, make 'em stick around
Treat you like a wife have you in the house
'Til I meet another bitch, then I kick you out
Rose gold on the Hublot
Tell me really how many bosses do you know?
Italian ties, no Armani
Why these niggas come up missin' is beyond me
Competition lookin more like featherweights
Jay Cutler of the game, movin' heavy weight
Elevators in the crib, paper on the plates
Couple million buried underground couldn't fit the safe
Spend it all in a fuckin day
Make it back tomorrow nigga, that's the hustler's way
