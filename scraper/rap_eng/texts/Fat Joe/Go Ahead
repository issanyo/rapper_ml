[Intro - DJ Khaled & Fabolous]
Yeah I met this shorty last night right (real rap)
And you know she looked like she was with her man (hehehe)
And you know I see you with your man
She was like, "nah that's my friend" (ooooh, okay)
So that was my cue, ayo Fab (ey Khaled)

[Verse 1 - Fabolous]
Shorty wanna give me the go ahead
That I'mma stay even when I need to go head
And if I feel something I'mma try
Figured you winked at me not just something in your eye
See shawty you ain't got to tell me what I know
That was E-40 who said "tell me when to go"
I know I got the green light, and ya'll get the red light
So if the head right I'll be there err night
Err night like a playoff game

Been a player unprepared, everybody grown folks
'Round here, them gold bottles hold them up
Then we can say, cheers (Let's take a toast)

Pull strings like a violin

To Z100 out to Ireland
White chicks is standing on line

Don't discriminate, I disintegrate
So much cake, maybe we can get away

[Hook - Lloyd]
