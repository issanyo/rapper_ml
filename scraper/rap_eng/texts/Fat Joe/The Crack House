Im sleepin' on a billion dollars
Coka
Im eatin
Crills
Im eatin
(Mania)
Im sleepin' on a billion dollars
And I say right about now New York City, ow!
Hoe no, oh Joe he did it, he's back
In the back of that black Maybach trippin
Now blow that motherfuckin kush up in da sky
La la la la, la la la
Bumpin that Kanye you can't tell me nothin' right?
La la la la, la la la la
Hand on the shotgun and Im ridin' shotgun
Uzis, banana clips, what what? I got some
Bullets are wholesale, food stamps, coupons
Yellow mustard Phantom car and Grey Poupon
I can make it Pac Man Jones in here too long
We up a hundred grand whenever I hear a new song
Cmon, cmon, thats too many ringtones
2.8 what you want me to tell ya?
Make it rain and Rihanna go an grab an umbrella
Ella, ella, ella
Holy shit, so much coke a nigga had to shovel it
So much coke a nigga change his government
Now we can all sing along for the fuck of it
Crack crack crack crack
Hey this is the crack house, welcome to the crack house
I mean I'm talkin more plies than a frat house
This is the problem, this is not music
I hope you find it, cause he about to lose it
Joey dont do it , Joey done did it
Joey keep doin it until youre done with it
Bring em to the crack house, show em the crack house
Take em to the crack house, we in the crack house
You gotta touch your toes or Im out
Fuck a club, I got a strip pole in my house
Six million ways to make it rain, hold up
Conflicts in my chain from Angola
Convicts in my plane when we roll up
And they hustle yay not vitamin water
Fat cause Im so rich, rich cause Im so hood
Uzi your whole whip, nigga Im that hood
You flow cold but Joe flow sicka
Even rappin I'll be like Joes that nigga
Joes got it, supreme team show
These are the niggas you compare to Joe, hello
Hey this is the crack house, welcome to the crack house
I mean I'm talkin more plies than a frat house
This is the problem, this is not music
I hope you find it, cause he about to lose it
Joey dont do it , Joey done did it
Joey keep doin it until youre done with it
Bring em to the crack house, its the crack house
Walk em to the crack house, we in the crack house
Talk to 'em
Get em, Joey, just get em, aha
Get em, get on them, yes
And if they piss you off, you shit on them, yes
And if they piss you off, you shit on them, ow!
Hey Weez, just stop right there
Shit Ill let em go get the whole block clear
These niggas act as they are not there
And their times tickin like an auto mare
First nigga pop up an we gave them the piece
Next nigga probably leave em under the sheets
Cmon Popeye you talkin to me
Ain't nobody else runnin these streets cocksucka
Hey this is the crack house, welcome to the crack house
I mean I'm talkin more plies than a frat house
This is the problem, this is not music
I hope you find it, cause he about to lose it
Joey dont do it, Joey done did it
Joey keep doin it until youre done with it
Take em to the crack house, they dont want the crack house
They dont want the crack house, kick em out da crack house
