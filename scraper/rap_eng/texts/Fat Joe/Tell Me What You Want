Yo
If you want it in the morning and you need it in the
Night
I'm a give it to you baby
I'm a give it to you right
[Sapphira]
Would you do whatever I want?
Would you give me all that I need?

[Fat Joe]
Ugh yo yo
Don't need to tell me about your love life
I can see it in your eyes you like the thug type, His & Her bikes
Diamonds in the rough? Right!
Love the crushed ice? Love to puff la? Love to get fucked? Right!
It's the Don with the S-Class, all aboard! With thebest ass
Known to make the sex last
Only rep that, bet ya can't sit
Joey Head Crack, keep you dancin', shit be hectic
Start the party in the limo, Bacardi con Limon
That's what's on, girl, shake your body, c'mon
Forget your friends, you can trust this
I know you heard how we run tris, but I want one chic
Don thick with the big hips,Joe will have a ho
Screaming "Fat niggas got big dicks!"
So lick your lips if you're feeling me, I'm right in
Front of Trinity
The way you work that thong, girl you're killin' me

[Hook]

[Armageaddon]
Yeah
Me? I love the way you work it now [now]
Pumping your bottom up and down like somebody played
You and now you tryin' to hurt them back
Whatever it is that you really need, you can get it
If it's me you can hit, if it's weed it's already litted
We can leave in a minute, hop in the drop top 3 if you wit it
Watch TV in it, feel the breeze
And get lifted on our way to the Four Seasons
Here's a sweet that I rented; I'm a get deeper in it
Than he's been in it
Bangin' like a chief's up in it [Don't Stop]
Fuck your punnony; butterfly on top of my body
I'm a suck that tootsie roll
'til the cops gotta come and find me
That's word life, mommy, I break you off like
Commission, through all the positions
Show you shit you always thought you was missing
Go and walk like a stallion, yelling "Fuck!" like Italians
Beat it from the back, with your butt hitting my trunk, gold medallion
I'm puttin' in work, so now you gotta trade your pussy in it
If Armageaddon heard it, let it rest 'til it's new again

[Cuban Link]
Dame un beso, en el pecho, y quitate pantalon
Let me freak your body, mommy, with my cancion
I got a spot at the Ramada, asta manana
Dame un beso en el quello y quitate pantalon
Let me freak your body, mommy, with my cancion
I got a spot at the Ramada, I make ya holla, holla
I make ya holla, holla, you're the best dada
I'm that dog with the collar, your father told you not to bother
Make it hotter than lava when I climb up in the cama
Llama me when you want and come satisfy your gana
I'm a smooth criminal, type of dude that's sneaking
Through your window while your husband slump, sleeping
In the living room, getting you best, get on that ass
Doing back flips, arial tactics that'll have you
Yelling that's it, then pass it to Joey Gauge
They both know me already, from the show to the telly
Are you ready like R. Kelly?
Just belly to belly dancing, have you cats steadily
Telling me I'm handsome
It's hard to keep my pants on, the last don; I last
Long like sad songs, mad strong
Known for breaking hearts and back bones, act grown
Cause ain't no chaperones in sight
It's no price, I'm a give you what you want tonight
