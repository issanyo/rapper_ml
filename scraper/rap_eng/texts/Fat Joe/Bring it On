[Intro, Spoken]:
Yeah yeah, what
Uh, Terror Squad
Uh, from the streets to the jail cell
I mean, my niggas is facing death penalties and all that
Charlie Rock L D
Yea yea, this go out to you my nigga
Yo, yo

[Verse 1]:
Ain't no solution for this
Since day one I been true to this shit
Often niggas try to shoot but they miss
I've been proven to hit so you know its really real
I went from chilling on the hills to signing deals worth fifty mil'
Self-made millionaire status
We all getting money but it's funny how mine makes niggas maddest
Come at us if you ready for war
Whoever you are
Leave you dead in your hall leaking red on the floor
Better than ya'll
Niggas need to face the facts
Since the days of crack I've been blazing gats trying to raise my stats
And I ain't tracing back you could find me at a racing track
Laced in black betting on a horse called Amazing Jack
Joey Crack's the illest fully backed my killers
Hopping outta 18 wheelers like mad gorillas
Niggas need to calm they nerves when I'm concerned
Cause if you didn't know by now you all gon' learn

[Chorus x2]:
I ain't know you really want it
How am I supposed to know there's something when you keep fronting
Don't want no people wanting to play my game
And if you really want the problems nigga say my name
Bring it on, come on

[Verse 2]:
I puts it down with Pun
Now all I do is lounge in the sun
Look what I done from the slums to sporting 5 thousand and ones
See the ice glitter I only walk with them nice niggas
Sheist niggas that quit it for doing life niggas
You out of touch we came through in the clutch
Fifty fifth ain't no what to do when I came through with ya
The Don Polly - you could find me in Flex's Denali
In times probably even marching at an Al Sharpton rally
I often carry that's the price of fame
Got precise the fame snipe you with the rifle and I light your brain
It ain't a game it's real niggas with real guns
That still run caught a box and pump ox by the millions
Before the children that's confusing life
The brutal type that'll pull out the Uz' and make you lose your life
The noose is tight I got 'em hanging by the neck
Man you tangling with vets when you banging with TS (what, what the fuck!)

[Chorus x2]
