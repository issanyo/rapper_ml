[Intro: Amerie]
Amerie, Fat Joe
Is the music

[Verse 1: Amerie]
Under all the lights
In the darkest nights
Feel it through my soul
Under all the lights
Feel like letting go

[Verse 2: Jean-Roch]
Since my early days
Searching for my way
I was so alone
I am ready to run away
I was on my own

[Hook: Amerie]
In this life I need to know
That I can fly away, fly away
No matter what you might say
I need to know
That i can fly away, fly away
In this life I need to know
That I can fly away, fly away
No matter what you might say
I need to know
That i can fly away, fly away

[Verse 3: Amerie **(w/ Jean Roch)**]
Walls are closing in
**Feel it happening but I feel no fear**
**Sounds come down crushing in**
But I am standing here

[Bridge 1: Fat Joe]
Hopped up on the six, we woke up in Saint Tropez
Talking 'bout ace of spades, we blowing em by the case
This is my life style, so what you tripping fo
My nick is right now, it's what we are living fo
Crack!

[Hook: Amerie]
In this life I need to know
That I can fly away, fly away
No matter what you might say
Oh, yeah, I need to know
That i can fly away, fly away
In this life I need to know
That I can fly away, fly away
No matter what you might say
I need to know
That i can fly away, fly away

[Verse 4: Fat Joe]
It's black cars, black clothes in every different store
The way she hits the floor, it's what we tippin for
Love faces, loud screams, it's what we missin for
On the kitchen floor, it's what we here for
Crack!

[Hook: Amerie]
In this life I need to know
That I can fly away, fly away
No matter what you might say
Oh, yeah, I need to know
That i can fly away, fly away
In this life I need to know
That I can fly away, fly away
No matter what you might say
I need to know
That i can fly away, fly away
