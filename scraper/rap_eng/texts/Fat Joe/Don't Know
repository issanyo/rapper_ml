[Intro: Fat Joe]
Renegade
They call him podcast papi
Niggas is Kinko's, I see they tryna copy
Diamonds in the chain bust down wrists and you ain't never seen no shit like this (uh what)
Tell me something I don't know (what)
Tell me something I don't know (what)
Tell me something I don't know
Like when this shit drop whole game in the choke-hold

[Verse 1: N.O.R.E.]
I be out late night opposite of play fight
See slime break night then slime break night
My wristwatch is like a brake light and you can get it right on your grave site
Uh so tell me something I don't know
$50 pizza when I'm eating in SoHo
Ah I heard that you in love with the coco
Stuffin ya nose hittin them Xans on the pogo
You wanna hate me then hate me what should I do
Keep getin money its funny I was just like you
Super Bowl Sunday, Drink Champs with the facts
Security guard told Kevin Hart to relax (ohh)

[Chorus: Fat Joe]
Tell me something I don't know (what)
Tell me something I don't know (what)
Tell me something I don't know
Like when this shit drop whole game in the choke-hold
Tell me something I don't know (what)
Tell me something I don't know (what)
Tell me something I don't know
Like when this shit drop whole game in the choke-hold

[Verse 2: N.O.R.E.]
Uh I reinvented myself they sorta hated it
I reinvented myself and upgraded it
Traded in the jewels copped a couple new ones
Lost a couple friends and got a couple new ones
Upstairs and downstairs the balcony these ocean side views the alchemy
Ain't nothin crazy like the city in the summertime so when its winter I still be on my summer grind

[Interlude: Fat Joe & N.O.R.E.]
Handle your business
Handle your business
Loyal and honour don't break no bro codes
The MoÃ«t rose match with the rose gold
Whoever counted me out they can't count (ohh)

[Chorus: Fat Joe]
Tell me something I don't know (what)
Tell me something I don't know (what)
Tell me something I don't know
Like when this shit drop whole game in the choke-hold
Tell me something I don't know (what)
Tell me something I don't know (what)
Tell me something I don't know
Like when this shit drop whole game in the choke-hold
They call him podcast papi niggas is Kinko's, I see they tryna to copy
Diamonds in the chain, bust down wrists and you ain't never seen no shit like this (uh what)
Tell me something I don't know (what)
Tell me something I don't know (what)
Tell me something I don't know
Like when this shit drop whole game in the choke-hold

[Outro: Fat Joe & N.O.R.E.]
