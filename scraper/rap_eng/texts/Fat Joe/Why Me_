*Chant*

(Why me)
Why my life had to be so rough
(Why me)
Why the fuck I had such bad luck
(Why me)
Why the judge wanna lock me up
Throw away the key and watch me rust

[Cuban Link]
Yo crack lets get a nine
My mind's trapped behind enemy lines
The scent of weed got me thinkin I remember the time
1979 they planned a biological test
The doctor said I'll be fine and planted a mic in my chest
It's Highteck, I got the fuckin' feds tracing my steps
So what's next? a bomb gold at the back of my neck
I'm in the U.S. everyday still got shit in check
Elly Yel crying freedom while he's facin the teck
I'm probably waistin my breath
Ain't no changin what's left
Start placin your best cause we all race against death
Shit be makin me vex
Cause I know the true fiends
In this game you never win and always loose
Even when you show and prove
Fuck the boys in blue for tryin to set me up
And I ain't sent you pigs you gon have to plant me up
I'm from the streets where we handle beef with lead slugs
So take caution, cause our protection sucks

[Chorus]
(Why me)
Why my life had to be so rough
(Why me)
Why the fuck I had such bad luck
(Why me)
Why the judge wanna lock me up
Throw away the key and watch me rust
Still in God I trust
(Why me)
Why these motherfuckers watchin me
(Why me)
Why they actin like we got the keys
(Why me)
Why these homies and clowns going around
Cloning the town down tryin to throw me with Gotti
Under the ground

[Fat Joe]
Yo niggas call me Joe the Don
Been in this rap game for nine years and going strong
Still holdin on
Still rollin on bitch made niggas
We sick of crazed niggas
That's quick to lay niggas
If Pac was here would these niggas be shinin
Would half these rappers be rappin' so violent
Cold figure, bow down to no nigga
Yeah them cats got rhymes but I flow sicker
For the Po niggas that drink more liquor
Shoot up clubs and love to clip the chrome triggers
Don't get your dough split up man
You fuckin with the wrong guys
You won't like it when you call Lah
And that's six feet hit you with twin piece
Double desert man it's pleasant when the grim reaps
Shit's deep but you gotta love it
I put the shot into your stomach catch your body if you feel for nothin

[Chorus 2X]
(Why me)
Why these motherfuckers watchin me
(Why me)
Why they actin like we got the keys
(Why me)
Why these homies and clowns going around
Cloning the town down tryin to throw me with Gotti
Under the ground
(Why me)
Why my life had to be so rough
(Why me)
Why the fuck I had such bad luck
(Why me)
Why the judge wanna lock me up
Throw away the key and watch me rust
Still in God I trust
