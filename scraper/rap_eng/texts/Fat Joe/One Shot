(Intro: Fat Joe)
Bria
Coca the don
One Shot

(Verse 1: Fat Joe)
Hey yo
It's all love yo we get it big time hit her with the
Nick Nine six times long as they respect mine
The s*** I'm on is wrong but it make her feel better
Ill wit her 42 help me deal wit her
She made a scene up in (?)
You know how hard it is to get a seat up in (?)
One shot two shots face (?) let the whole crew rock
Baby blue drop got to bear a new watch
Used to bump blue tops Lauryn Hill Doo Wop
We be sippin' on blue dot
Brain in the coupe now we call that rooftop

(Verse 2: Bria Lee)
One shot you still lookin' at me
Two shots always yellin' at me
Three shots and i'm startin' to see that you look better when you're blurry
Four shots i'll tell you how I feel
Damn I should've known that the loves not real
Five shots why don't you pack your things
For the 2nd time this week

(Hook: Bria Lee)
Story of my life
And I can't escape no matter how I try
We can't get it right
I'm addicted to the pain I try to hide
So I drink the thought away
I sleep another day
My broken record plays
And if you chose to stay
I'll drink the thought away
Away (x2)
While my broken record plays
I'll drink the thought away

(Verse 3: Bria Lee)
Got a bottle sitting on my lap
A strong one about to throw it back
Don't pour it I drink it just like that
With a mouth like yours I don't need a glass
One shot I could (?)
Two shots you got me stuttering
Three shots he'll be out the door while i'm passed out on the bathroom floor

(Hook: Bria Lee)
Story of my life
And I can't escape no matter how I try
We can't get it right
I'm addicted to the pain I try to hide
So I drink the thought away
I sleep another day
My broken record plays
And if you chose to stay
I'll drink the thought away
Away (x2)
While my broken record plays
I'll drink the thought away

(Verse 4: Bria Lee)
In the morning when i'm all alone the sunlight burns my eyes
Pounding some familiar feeling grief is no surprise
(?) of the words we wish we never said
I count the hours I got left until we thought again

(Hook: Bria Lee)
So I drink the thought away
I sleep another day
My broken record plays
And if you chose to stay
I'll drink the thought away
Away (x2)
While my broken record plays
I'll drink the thought away

(Outro: Fat Joe)
One shot (x2)
