(Intro- DJ Absolut)

Give ya what you’ve neva seen Uh!
It’s cook coke crack
Addicted fo’ lifer
CEO Don and the king
Dawn nigga 3, terror error’s the squad
All that real shit
Mighty,waddup, nigga

(Verse 1: Fat Joe)

Im on some bullshit Nigga
We pull quick and leave ’em choking
Soakin’ in his own blood with his chest open
This last hope and ain’t no comin’ after that
All the shit the nigga was talkin’, he should of packed the gat
Sex money and drugs, sex honeys and clubs
Niggas talk, but don’t want it with us
Uh, niggas packing, but don’t want it to bust
To tell the truth, niggas get scared straight on the bus
We the truth, ain’t no changing us
Niggas hating away, we be raking the bucks in
I’m still in the projects, man, still flippin’ powder man
Still mr. Knee[?] cruisin’ Holidan [?]
Now give me some beats on the other hand
And watch this track bleed like I’m son of Sam
T-E-R-R-o-R Squad
We run up in your window like we brother man
Yeah! Straight business, nigga

(Chorus:T.I)

Plenty niggas act up and talk greasy
So plenty niggas gon’ have to stop breathin’
If any nigga try, then every nigga die
They slip up, this G shit ain’t easy

(Verse 2: Fat Joe)
Don’t get set up, nigga, ask a muthafuckin’ loo
No algebra how i break you down to pieces
Then sprinkle the town with some pounds of ether
Errbody know nothin’ less than a knot
Half the beef ain’t censored just to keep ’em in line
Extortion, never understood man it’s crazy
How niggas selling crack is paying niggas for safety
Lately this rap shit goin’ the same way
If ya know that nigga ass, then that nigga gon pay
It’s cooked coke, Joe hard, whatever you call it
Just know a nigga going hard at whoever want it
Flown and it’s snookin’, even in central bookin’
Errbody sleepin’ on the floor when Joe’s in the buildin’
Not hatin’ black, don’t know why they take it a-crack
I don’t exaggerate, I’m just statin’ the facts
Terror error the squad, most identic
If I ain’t present, I’mma make sure the streets know who sent it Nigga! Y’all know what the fuck this is!

(Chorus)
