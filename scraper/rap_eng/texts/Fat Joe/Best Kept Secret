[Verse One]
You see I skip to my lou like Napoleon at Waterloo
My name is Diamond D, tell you what I'm gonna do
I dip and I dab like a Mike Tyson jab
Even though there's flab I possess the gift of gab
I shoot it like a jammy and girls give the panties and
Even with a fanny and I might win a Grammy and
Maybe I won't so I'll chill like the pope
See I'll never mope cause I know my shit is dope
Like Columbian fish scale, ask my man Ishmael
(Diamond D got props like a cop)
Or better yet DT cause brothers can't see me
Even your girl says you got a small wee wee
Now you wanna go upside her head
Do you feel intimidated by the things she said
Don't be mad cause I paid her back
(You know I) took her to the res and I laid her back
(I go) on and on like popcorn with the butter
A-a-a-a-yo! I used to stutter
But I fall on track and some may say I'm wack and
Fact, but in fact, I'm not any of that black
See I'm the best kept secret
So shut the fuck up and peep it

[Hook]
"Diamond D"... "Raised in Forest"
"Rapper tries to diss I crush the motherfucker"
(Repeat x4)

[Verse Two]
See I write my own rhymes, produce my own shit
Yeah boy, I ain't the one to fuck with
I'll take a beat and I'll flip it
With so much flavor, niggas wanna sip it
But that's cool cause they know I got skills
Let me demonstrate if you will, ahem
Rock is my man and so is Dapper Dan and
I'll shake your hand and don't try to flam
Or front like a stunt who lost her cunt
I only hit grand slams, never will I bunt
Bases are loaded, bottom of the ninth
I step to the plate cause I know my shit is great
I can't walk down the street
(A-yo Diamond, can you make me a beat)
You gotta have cheese, about a couple of G's
But if I know ya, I might just throw ya
A little something on the side, troop
A funky bassline and a hype loop
I got a thousand old records in my crib
I used to hustle but I never did a bid
Some people call me Jo Jo, I keep a low pro
Non-stop props, so act like you know bro
Pass me a mic and I'mma keep it
Yeah boy, I'm the best kept secret

[Hook]

[Verse Three]
Yo, I'm deadlier than Michael Myers
My style will embrace you like a pair of pliers
But don't sweat it G, why don't you let it be
Cause Diamond D is a pedigree
In other words I'm official
I'll never go out like a wet piece of tissue
Ruff and rugged, stronger than Bounty
New York is the city, Bronx is the county
Learned from the best so the rest just fess
Now I'm gettin' booked at the Fillmore West
Located in the Village, so kill it, 'skillet
You ask yourself, will it ever cease?
Cause Diamond's sharp as a crease
I only use bees wax, I'll never use grease on my dreads
But instead if you want some kicks
Step to the mic I'm an 8 to 1 pick
You reap what you sow and I can reap it
Yo I'm the best kept secret

[Hook]
