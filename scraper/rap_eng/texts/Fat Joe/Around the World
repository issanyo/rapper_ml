[Intro]
Mark Henry...

[Verse 1: Fat Joe]
Is this what it's about, baby?
Fuck in the champagne, let's toast to the cocaine, uhh
It put me on that G4 plane
Now we in G5's, and go where we desire
Roll a thousand niggas deep
You used to love it, now it's about just you and me
Bitch you bluffin', I ain't playin '
I'm just sayin' let a nigga live
I was fuckin' them hoes, I put you where I live
You had the keys to the Panamera
Always tryin' to blame me, you need to blame the mirror
I blame myself for fuckin' with ya girl
But couldn't help but love the way the spandex fit ya girl
All that ass, slim waist
Nice walk, cute face, sick taste
Bal Harbour gon' miss ya boo
And the condo security guards they gon' miss ya too

[Chorus: Arland]
Let's take a trip, let's take a trip
Let's take a trip around the world, ohhh oohhh, ooooh
Let's take a trip, let's take a trip
Let's take a trip around the world, ohhh oohhh, ooooh

[Verse 2: Fat Joe]
Got killers on a private
No need for public defenders when you get the kind of cheese that I get
Watch the sunset from up above
I swear to God, I seen the drugs fall from up above
Let's take a trip
Somewhere special, where there's water then we'll take a dip
You can order you some diamonds with a side of grits
Sip mimosa and then fuck to the sounds of Vandross
Luther
You don't listen, he might lose ya
Don't diss him, he might shoot ya
Paradise is just a step away
Look in my eyes, I'll take ya breath away

[Chorus: Arland]
Let's take a trip, let's take a trip
Let's take a trip around the world, ohhh oohhh, ooooh
Let's take a trip, let's take a trip
Let's take a trip around the world, ohhh oohhh, ooooh

[Verse 3: Arland]
You don't have to run no further baby
'Cause I might keep on doin' my thing
Yeeeeaaah, ohhhhhhhhhh, ohhhh

[Chorus: Arland]
Let's take a trip, let's take a trip
Let's take a trip around the world, ohhh oohhh, ooooh
Let's take a trip, let's take a trip
Let's take a trip around the world, ohhh oohhh, ooooh

[Outro: Arland]
All around the world we goooo
London and Tokyo
Wherever this long journey takes us we'll goooooooo
And if you don't then, I don't care 'cause I'm gon' fuuucck
Every bitch around the world
