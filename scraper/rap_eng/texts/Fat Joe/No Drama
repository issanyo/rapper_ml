Motherf***, this is business, never personal
This Coca, baby, I'm an 88er
I put work in these streets, now do yourself the favor
You bring the drama, then drama leads to choppers
Then them choppers get to sprayin' and somebody need a doctor now
You not an actor, not a rapper
You'se a clapper, you'se a trapper
Got a ratchet, so why you hire coppers now?

*** want beef with me, must be out of his mind
Homey think that Joey past his prime
Laid his ass flat in the street, yeah, I splattered his mind
Walked away with his life and his shines
Yeah, I smell nookie, nookie, yeah, nookie, nookie
That's how he looked when I left the homey's face gushy
Ask about it, cracks about it
Went back to the crib and then we laughed about it
I'm a rider, homicider, I'm a money maker
I decided you'se a liar when it comes to paper
Broad day, we could clap it in these streets

And I'm a rat killer, you hear that brrat, ***?
I don't rap, in fact, I'm just that ***, yeah, it's crack, ***
A lot of chicks like to talk, make 'em bite they tongue
Lot of cats claim New York but they not the one
I'm in the streets, muh'f***, you could call me Harlem
In Bed-Stuy like Biggie, the big homey's a problem
