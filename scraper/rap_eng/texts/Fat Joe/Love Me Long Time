[Intro: Future]
It ain't about this ice around my mu'fuckin neck
And Givenchy and Versace and shit, you kno what I'm sayin'?
I gonna run out of time with you

[Hook: Future]
With money and the fame and the women
With the luxury cars and the all the spending
Can you love me? (Can you love me? 3x)
Can you love me? (can you love me?)
Love me long time (Long Time, Long Time)
Love me long time (Long Time, Long Time)
Can you love me? (Can you love me? 3x)
Can you love me? (Can you love me)
Love me long time

[Fat Joe]
Yeah, uh..
Papi love you long time, girl
Smoking on Jamaican, that's that uptown girl
Gave you keys to that drop (drop), hundred G's it's a shot (shot)
Bal harbor, to the harbor, diving off of them yachts
Body look like a stallion, girl, hit the gym and coast fiending
Used to go with just window shop, couldn't even go send it
Got too used to that winning (winning), I got used to them women
Now you beef, stay at least, never dreamed to this ending

[Hook: Future]

[Fat Joe]
You said you'd love me long time girl
But now you say I call you at the wrong time, girl
Oh you acting different (different), what you out here slipping (slipping)
Run the streets with these enemies and make me no difference
Show me that catalogue, to hermans I cope that
They said it only come in hard top, I drop that
Mama said you don't love me (love me), shit about to get ugly
Would you love me and fuck me, if I wasn't getting this money

[Future]
If I ain't have that theory, five karat earrings
Girl would you love me for me?
When that money get low you started tripping
Now you walking out the door and you flipping
Even my mama said you wasn't gon' love me
From the beginning
Cause I was winning
I didn't listen

Can you love me for me?
Can you love me for me? (Can you love me? 6x)
Love me long time, love me long time 2x
Can you love me? (Can you love me? 3x)
If you love me (can you love me)
Love me long time
Love me all the time
Love me all the time
If you love me
