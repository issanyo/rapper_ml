[Verse 1: Pete Powerz]
Powerz the barbarian, swinging axe
I'm throwin' rappers back
I'm the mighty Thor relax
But ya'll kill me with these Marvel Comic raps
I'm avengin' on the track
I'm from the Bronx, promised my mother to bring it back
I'm from the borough I attack, how you want it?
Straight blade to the back, (????), 151 stray back
A Hundred Sixteen get it clapped, Kings Bridge north Bronx, is where it's at
I let it off no thing, ear drums blown no rings, see no evil see no thing
The super hero came to bring the corners back, couple of bodegas gettin' taxed
And I ain't declare war but get it strapped
Rob you give it back
I'm playin' hot potato with the gat, don't pass it back

[Verse 2: Mysonne]
I live in Highbridge, reside on the West Side of the B-Cross, where killa niggas dress fly
Smooth like Harlem, gritty like Bed-Stuy, my Spanish niggas put bullets in your cabeza
Yes I, I ride like the 4 Train, can't catch you, put 5 up in your offspring
Poor thing, gotta pay for his father's sins
We on the corners with (???) and orange Timbs
Yeah, see we grind 'round these parts
You need heart to survive 'round these parts
We spark every day a nigga see chalk, on the street
We book niggas we street smart
We started this rap shit fam but, don't get it backwards fam
We don't just rap, you can get your fucking cap twist fam, step back, click clack click BAM

[Verse 3: Fred the Godson]
156, (?????????), 1-7-8 off a nigga your crew know me
Cypress, (???), Bronx river, (????)
Castle Hill blast the steel, Fred I don't need to brawl
How 'bout a Rest In Peace Party Arty
Used to spend my weekends bagging up, I hardly partied
I bag baby doll cause I raise the bar b, get it? Baby doll Barbie probably
I'm one of the best lyricists that ever gone and did it, excluding Christopher Rios, nah no Pun intended
I (????) with KRS and Mickey Factz, my brother Cory Gunz, Godson bring it back
You know the punchlines, slick talk, metaphors
(???????), can't ride, (?????)
I never lost, clear shot
Before me, the X was silent
Xerox
