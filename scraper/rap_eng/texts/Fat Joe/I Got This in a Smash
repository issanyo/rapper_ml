Yeah, it's time to let 'em know how I got this here
Fat Joe Da Gangsta, got this in a smash, know what I'm saying?
Showbiz, Diamond D, check this out

Awww, one to the head, I don't give a fuck
Suckers better duck, buck buck buck buck!
I let off mad shots
You get dragged when you face the big shot
Yeah, and the Bronx is my territory
Suckers getting sprayed, end of story
Whether one deep or with my crew
I pack a .45, my girl packs a .22
Huh, so you know I'm all right
If niggas want beef, then I give 'em a hell of a fight
Yeah, I'm quick to blow a nigga out the frame
I'm insane, pushing punks in front of a train
Cause I don't have it up to here
Talking about skins, I have more than Richard Gere
Yeah, cause I got it like that
It ain't hard to tell that Joe is living fat
How I last and surpass any nigga who shows his ass
Is gonna end up getting blast
Run for jewels and give me the cash
Everybody knows I got this in a smash

Yeah, you know I got this in a smash (So what's up, what's up?) (Repeat 4x)

Aw shit, another brother hit
This time it's Tone, life is a fucking bitch
It really hurts when the shit hits home
Early in the morning, they calling me on the phone
Telling me my man caught eight to the chest
Nah, this couldn't be, Tone always wore a vest
But that's the way the story goes
Today you're here, and tomorrow who knows?
Man I'm gonna miss him, I love him to death
Charlie's in jail and I'm the only brother left
It's time to get strong, forget about the sorrow
But like Ike said, no one is promised tomorrow
Fuck the bullshitting, it's time to get cash
Don't fuck with me cause I got this in a smash

Yeah, you know I got this in a smash (So what's up, what's up?) (Repeat 4x)

Well it's the F-A-T, Gang S-T-E-R
Living like a star, drive a fat car
525 and I'm crazy live
Not all the loot in the world could make me take a dive
Fucking mad bitches on the first date
Straight to the telly, hit the skins, I gotta skate
See, I got no time for a stunt
Because a 40 and a blunt, that's all she really wants
Yeah, so dough keeps collecting PC
Knocking out punks with my man Diamond D
Cause everybody knows I'm the man
And if you fuck with me, then shit'll hit the fan
I took mad flicks since '76
Robbing every other brother for their motherfucking kicks
I once heard a kid say he's his brother's keeper
His brother turned around and bust him with a street sweeper
Everybody wants the cash
But don't fuck with me cause I got this in a smash

Yeah, you know I got this in a smash (So what's up, what's up?) (Repeat 4x)
