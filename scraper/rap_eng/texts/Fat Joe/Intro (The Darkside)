[Intro]
Bitch ass niggas
Welcome to the (*scratches*)
Welcome to the dark
(*scratches*) darkside

[Verse]
Peep the piff, smoke blowin' through the sunroof
Suede top, mink floors, outside sunny duke
Rims like 26, wrist watch extra chip
And fuck ya baby momma, she can suck a nigga dick
This ain't the past, the present, I'm the future
They size me like I'm super but manuever like a cougar
Joe bazooka, I (?) with the flow
And I can show you how to get knee deep with the coke
This that genocide talk that killin' babies again
And there's lines around the block like it's the 80's again
Yeah The Darkside, and you don't wanna go to this place
Where I got special powers, I can punch a hole through ya face
More coca to taste, more bitches to beat up
Got lips like Meagan Good, and a ass like Vita
Most niggas'll go down if she tell 'em to eat her
But she don't love no more, she seen my episode of "Cheaters"
I'm too high, whole 'nother zone, I'm far-fetched
They put me on the back of that yellow bus like (?)
But R. less, that's that sexy music
Yeah we playin' the background when I shoot it down like cupid
Tell shorty to get the balls, the other two on the dick
The triple play is the deal, damn my life is the shit
And this ain't about money, it's 'bout who's real and who's fake
Who's really a gangsta? Who's fuckin' with Jake?
I throw bodies in the lakes and the others I burn 'em
Stuff a apple in his mouth, and over fire I turn him
It's the reaper man, that'll still rob the reefer man
And rap music ain't the only thing we deeper than
My nigga OG Muggs know we certified
And we gon' throw the biggest party when Curtis die
