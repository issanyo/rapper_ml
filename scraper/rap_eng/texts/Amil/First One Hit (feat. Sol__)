(feat. Sole')

[Sole]
Here it comes, blaze the eye of da storm
Never saw me comin, but I made sure you was warned
In the blaze, I'm runnin gun high soundin the horn
See my niggas never run a negative 4
When I see you stuntin, give me what I need or I take it
Fuck game
Pass the blame ain't no need to be fakin
Muthafuckas wanna bring it to the point where I'm breakin
Feel the wrath in the heart, nigga ain't no mistakin
You gon wait until it calm and the size of the rain
There they go, swallow pride like you swallow my pain
Where da grain? Feel my fire, don't you wish it was tamed?
Cake ain't the same, playa, keep on yellin my name
So they, made the cards I was delt in the game
Take it how you give it, many keep abandonin the blame
Based on how you livin, fuck me's nothin the same
3-6 pimpin at the market knew I came

[Chorus: Amil]
My bitcheeeesssss, light it up and don't stop
We gon make it happen til the last one drop
My niggggaaaazzzz, light it up and don't quit
In the new millenium don't take no shit
My bitcheeeesssss, light it up and don't stop
They gon know we real when we let the guns pop
My niggggaaaazzzz, light it up and don't quit
First one move be the first one hit

[Amil]
Sumpin's bout to jump off
I can feel dis, safteys come off
In tight situations, weak niggas run off
Done off, when the guns go off
Blaow, bout to light shit up
Quicker than cops write shit up
If it get too hectic then you might get stuck
Locked and tied up
While the, key players still the key players
Never burn bitches cuz you might need favors
1-7 cat stacked in 3 layers
All dem house rider mouth, fought to see neighbor
Suspects, what the fuck now?
I double up techs like I shuffle up decks
Rude relationships wit those who cut checks
I want what I want
Nothing less
Yeah yeah, Amillion nigga what

[Chorus: Amil]
My bitcheeeesssss, light it up and don't stop
We gon make it happen til the last one drop
My niggggaaaazzzz, light it up and don't quit
In the new millenium don't take no shit
My bitcheeeesssss, light it up and don't stop
They gon know we real when we let the guns pop
My niggggaaaazzzz, light it up and don't quit
First one move be the first one hit

[Sole]
Light it up, see me callin your bluff
Knuckle up, like a shrug when you thought you was buff
What the fuck?, Tryin to put it down harder than us
Better duck, nigga hair snow like it was puff
Catch the lug, run up
Let me show you we wain't playin in here
Times up, give it up, we gon play on ya fear
One up, Two ahead made it perfectly clear
So the, muthafucka feel the switch of the year

[Amil]
How you like me now?
A lil more fiesty now
Don't get mad cuz I might see now
Just imagine what the price be now
Whoooaaa, I come wit it
Make mouths drop
Got you suckin the titties, poutin a lot
Then when I bring it, I crowd the block
Amillion so laid, ain't about to stop

[Chorus x3: Amil & Sole]
My bitcheeeesssss, light it up and don't stop
We gon make it happen til the last one drop
My niggggaaaazzzz, light it up and don't quit
In the new millenium don't take no shit
My bitcheeeesssss, light it up and don't stop
They gon know we real when we let the guns pop
My niggggaaaazzzz, light it up and don't quit
First one move be the first one hit

[ad libs]

[Chorus x3: Amil & Sole]
My bitcheeeesssss, light it up and don't stop
We gon make it happen til the last one drop
My niggggaaaazzzz, light it up and don't quit
In the new millenium don't take no shit
My bitcheeeesssss, light it up and don't stop
They gon know we real when we let the guns pop
My niggggaaaazzzz, light it up and don't quit
First one move be the first one hit
