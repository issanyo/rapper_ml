Glamorous Life by Lucy Diamonds feat Amil and Jonathan Hay

Verse 1: Lucy Diamonds

Wanna get a taste of Cannabis?
Legalize, manufacture a can of this
Glamorous, back of the club, Minneapolis, acting up
Everybody was damning it, up on a barstool slamming it
I got the sugar Nick Cannon licks, press taking pics with a Canon lens
I freeze like a mannequin, fight 'em off like Anakin
I'm swearing out antonyms cause I'm played like a mandolin
Can I win?  All the odds, I'm gambling, rambling
"Everybody's so glamorous!"
Y'all know what the anthem is!

Chrous: Haze

She wants to live the glamorous life
(She wants to live the glamorous life)
She wants to live the glamorous life
(She wants to live the glamorous life)

Verse 2: Amil

I want breakfast in bed in my baby mansion
Maybe the one out in the Hamptons
Fly in a private jet to Manhattan
Chauffeured Bentley waiting when I'm landing
I'm 'bout to hit 5th Ave, and blow some real big cash
Splurging at expensive places
They all know me on a first name basis
I'm in the mood to hit up Jacob's
Cop a couple Roli's with the diamond faces
I got big plans tonight
Got a party to attend in France tonight
Should I wear my purse with the LV's
With that cute lil' dress by D&G?
I'll be looking so glamorous
Who said money can't buy me happiness, huh??

Repeat Chorus

Verse 3: Lucy Diamonds

I'm gonna get some **ish** and spend up my advances
Look at all the diamonds shine in Lucy Diamonds' glasses
Look at all the diamonds shine around Lucy Diamonds' wrists
Look at all the **ish** I get, forget about accountants
Material girl like Madonna, on a shopping spree
Everybody just lied to you cause the best **ish** in life ain't free
Look at all the diamonds shine around Lucy Diamonds' neck
I ain't ever got cash on hand cause I'm living on credit
Gonna get a breast enlargement
Gonna get my card to charge it
Botox injections, lipo sections
I don't wanna look retarded
Somebody went and told me that myself was all that I had to be
I said that's right so why am I another someone to me?

Repeat Chorus

"Glamorous Life" appears on both LP's 'Old Friends' and 'Poor Dream Redemption'
