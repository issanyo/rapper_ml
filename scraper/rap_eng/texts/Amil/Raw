[Amil]
I'm making it hard for these little rap chicks to come out
I'm coppin' whips you in the street with your thumb out
You wanna battle but when it's time to spit you dumb out
Singles I've touched been going platinum since the first one out
I put on seven niggas just to carry me on
Amilliyon say the hook let'em carry the song
I be the only bitch on the mic makin' it hot
With the smoke in the drop in the vacant lot
Since this bitch been in this game I been takin' spots
And if you hatin' me, shit you must be hatin' the Roc
Take it there yeah, I break it down like this
Ain't a bitch live who can make it sound like this
Don't make Amilliyon have to pull rank
Lyrics never on E, I keep a full tank
Any nigga that I fuck wit got my name in the bank
Yeah you heard me, he got at least my name in the bank

Chorus: 2xs
Everything I spit be raw
I be like 10lbs of coke and be quick to draw
And it's pure fuck Miami, it be Ecuador
For my peeps fuck a foot
I got they leg in the door

Yo, let's take it to the whips, bitch five or six
We could take it to the block flip dimes to bricks
Take it to the mic see who spit the livest shit
Who wanna take it to the streets to the nines and clips
I'm the bitch that won't skate when daddy empty the safe
Lie on the stand if Jake hem'em up with a case
Far as this rap shit fuck fame or shine or rhyme
I don't care who joint drop the same time as min
Chicks redo albums once they heard my buzz
Mother fuckers know, I'm a track murderer
So you could, pop shit bitch run your mouth
I know niggas that'll get you right in front of your house
For free and that's just on the strength of me
If you could touch Amil then you could mention me
You think Jay wrote this, that's complimenting me
I'm the best till somebody prove me differently

Chorus:

You got beef, let's put it all on the table
You want the hottest clique on the street
You know the label
You want the hottest bitch ever known I' willing and able
Could y'all broads be story tale like a Eastside fable
You want me to spit bitch make it payable
If you lucky if you'll be hearing back within a day or two
That's just comin from a chick who done paid her dues
Know I'm the hottest chick from kicks to the gator shoes
A yo, respect this shield of David piece on the necklace
Now who wanna take it to some next shit?
Hey yo I crush all bitches, eat up most niggas
Teach these rap broads, train gold diggas
You know I know niggas and you know I hld figures
We speak but that don't mean my niggas is yo niggas
We up in your spot strapped with the hoods on
I am  Major Coins and any bitch I put on nigga

Chorus:
