[Amil]
Yo, ever since I known you, you been out to get me
Acting like my peeps, but I know that's how you tricked me
Love to see me get high, love to see my tipsy
Heard you even wanna stick a little chip in me
You been trying to play me close ever since my shine
Wanna take me to dinner, feed me shrimp and swine
You said, "Amil I want you to meet a good friend of mine
His name is Money and we partners till the end of time"
Introduced me to your clique, hate, envy, lust and greed
Said you want the whole world in ya custody
And if I give you my soul you'll give me luxuries
Said you could hit me up wit power, it's just up to me
I turn you on when I'm in short skirts and tight jeans
You want my kids to write Santa and celebrate Halloween
Told me sell my people crack and get rich off fens
You love the number 6 but hate the number 13

Chorus: [Carl Thomas]
We'll have some quarrels
Some disappointments
And a whole lot of problems
And you will except me

[Amil]
You wanna, be the one to pick me up when I fall
Told me hang Casear Borgia on my living room wall
It was always something bout you that made my skin crawl
You turned me into a player and showed me how to ball
You give me rewards when I rob and steal
Want me to abort my babies and get on the pill
You put burners in the hood so each other we kill
I see your eye watching me on the dollar bills
When I got the scoop on you, it just made you mad
Cause I moved out your crib, packed all my bags
Them days I turned to you was the days you laughed
You used to smile every time I pledge allegiance to the flag
We speak now and then but we ain't smacking hands
You be up in the clubs asking me for a dance
Still trying to convince me to go cheat on my man
Begging me to please give you just one more chance

Chorus:

[Amil]
When we was kids you was the one who taught me how to lie
Said I could always use you as my alibi
And you kept me from knowledge, wisdom, and the most high
Had me believe God had blonde hair and blue eyes
Our relationship went sour since I found the truth
You know you can't have me so you fuck with my youth
You got all my phones tapped, I gotta talk at booths
I learned an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth
You built Sodom and Gomorra for us all to live in
When we was cool you used to tell me all your visions
Like how you gonna rule the nations under one religion
You got this New World order, it's like a big prison
You said you wanna be worshipped from noon to noon
Nothings gonna get better is what we all assumed
Cause nights is getting shorter and it's snowing in June
I see you working overtime cause you out of here soon
