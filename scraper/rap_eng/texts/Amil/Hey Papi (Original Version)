[Verse 1: Jay-Z]
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Ay yo I got a resolution
This year I'm playing right
No 6:15 and shit (but)
You can stay the night
We can go bowling it ain't like before
Can't you, see that I'm growing?
I was so immature
I was young and having money
Having honies come to the crib
Digging they shit and they couldn't get cab money from me
Some bad chicks didn't get pass the bridge
I went to One Trump Plaza on their asses'
No room service, just snacks and shit
Work with those Lil' Debbies and when your done get ready
But chicks I was fiending to smash
Let 'em lean on the cash
Take 'em on long trips
Break 'em with long dick
There was no such thing as strong relationships
But I'm off that playa shit
I need a chick that practice Tai Chi
And still can buy weed
And can give me some good head
I'll make her remind me, ya hear me?

[Chorus: Jay-Z (Amil)]
(Hey papi)
Even if they don't understand the flow
They understand the dough
My ladies going
(Hey papi)
Promise you'll never let me go
Promise you'll never leave me
Promise we'll grow, they saying
(Hey papi)
Even if they don't understand the flow
They understand the dough
My ladies going
(Hey papi)
Promise you'll never let me go
Promise you'll never leave me
Promise we'll grow, they saying

[Verse 2: Jay-Z]
I was the worse
I used to switch chicks every day
Had niggas mad for real like, "I wish he was gay"
'Cause they knew, sooner or later hun was getting with Jay
In just a, matter of time she was getting with Jay
I'll have your chick in the tropics, somewhere sipping on 'zae
Spitting up in the Pacific, smoking spliffs in the shade
She used to love ya, but she feeling different today
You used to smother her, look at your honey slipping away
Consorting with hustlers, niggas that be giving her space
She said, she feel free when she around me
I'm letting her do her and in turn she's doing me
She's on the phone with her friends like, "How cool is he?"

[Chorus: Jay-Z (Amil)]
(Hey papi)
Even if they don't understand the flow
They understand the dough
My ladies going
(Hey papi)
Promise you'll never let me go
Promise you'll never leave me
Promise we'll grow, they saying
(Hey papi)
Even if they don't understand the flow
They understand the dough
My ladies going
(Hey papi)
Promise you'll never let me go
Promise you'll never leave me
Promise we'll grow, they saying

[Verse 3: Jay-Z]
I was nice to girls but that wasn't the Shawn they felt
They said the coupe was alright, but they ain't like the seat belt
I look tight, they told me loosen up, run a couple of lights
Spank 'em, pull their hair, just don't treat 'em so nice
Left me confused, I mess with chicks that was best when abused
Nice guys finish last was they special set of rules
And me, I overdid it (uh-huh), all chauvinistic
Would treat 'em so vicious, would stroke, but won't kiss it
But now, I'm trying to flow different
I'm trying to cool it now
I'm trying to plant a seed, start a new edition
I'm sick of chasing chickens
Sick of every other city we go, same ol' hoes

[Chorus: Jay-Z (Amil)]
(Hey papi)
Even if they don't understand the flow
They understand the dough
My ladies going
(Hey papi)
Promise you'll never let me go
Promise you'll never leave me
Promise we'll grow, they saying
(Hey papi)
Even if they don't understand the flow
They understand the dough
My ladies going
(Hey papi)
Promise you'll never let me go
Promise you'll never leave me
Promise we'll grow, they saying
(Hey papi)
Even if they don't understand the flow
They understand the dough
My ladies going
(Hey papi)
Promise you'll never let me go
Promise you'll never leave me
Promise we'll grow, they saying
(Hey papi)
Even if they don't understand the flow
They understand the dough
My ladies going
(Hey papi)
Promise you'll never let me go
Promise you'll never leave me
Promise we'll grow, they saying
(Hey papi)
