Why won't you give me a chance?
When I'm giving you everything that I am
Tell me why
When you know you can't deny
The way that I bring it
Cause no one can bring it to you the way that I do

Chorus:
When will you see
That there's no one like me (no one no one)
No matter how hard they try to be
Cause they just don't flow (they don't flow)
The way that I flow (The way I flow)
So baby don't fight it

It seems the more that I try
The harder you make it for me to get by
If you only knew how I felt inside
I'm sure you would be so blind
Cause another like me you won't find

You better think it over before you try
To say that no one can give you what you like
Cause I know just what you want
And there's no way you can front on me
I hope you see
That you belong to me

Repeat chorus

So don't fight the way it feels when  I do my thing

Trick don't leave for ten months
Flip on my for those ?????
Jay, my friend blunts
I'm tight though, mad that you're platinum plus
Let me find out that some broad got you acting up
Spread your wings so I figure you'll be back in touch
Wondering if whats-his-name will he tap my stuff
Yo, all I wanna do if get this doe together
Even if you want this on the low whatever
Fuck around, it's gonna be a hoe forever
Cause when it's beef, I know that we're gonna throw together
But we got issues nigga, cause what you did for me lately
To be a little skanky with them bitches that hate me
You know the kind, door knockers hollaring at that
Them bootlegging bitches, I don't even blick at that
Stop playing, Especially when I'm ?? or black
They think your back how you were putting minks on my back

Repeat Chorus 4 times (with ad-libs)
