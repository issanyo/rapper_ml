How many chicks wanna fuck tonight? [(Amil)] Tonight
How many chicks wanna suck tonight? [(Amil)] Tonight
How many chicks wanna fuck and suck and suck?
Get fucked and bust tonight?

[Verse 1]
Lex GS, Wide body, Remy VS
Militants niggas see less, chrome spinnin'
Got a lust for them grown women
Classy skirt, work-type chicks that own linen and
Hate sneakers, only accept cellies, won't chase beepers
Understand space when needed they relate deeper
Respect hustle, pretty wit' they lewie duffle
Via Spigga wit' the stacks over they Huey Russle
I style wit' 'em, smile, sit 'em down, child wit' 'em
Lay it down if it's love then I'm outa town wit' 'em
Show 'em some new shit, then give 'em some new dick
Help 'em really confront on who they fucking wit'
Feel a nigga? I'm made for this, remain flawless
I'm like the same song never change chorus
It's real, from the hood, but fortune and still
Lost in the hills, niggas soft in the grill
It's on

How many chicks wanna fuck tonight? [(Amil)] Tonight
How many chicks wanna suck tonight? [(Amil)] Tonight
How many chicks wanna fuck and suck?
And suck, get fucked and bust tonight?

Yo:
How many niggas wanna stick tonight? [(AZ)] Tonight
How many niggas wanna lick tonight? [(AZ)] Tonight
How many niggas wanna stick and lick?
And stick and lick and trick tonight?

[Verse 2]
Eight wonder, poker face, aces under
Embrace the mink weather but relate to summer
New wardrobe, chicks wit' they waistes younger
Big coupes kitted up, you can taste the hunger
Hang wit' me, watch how the ladies exchange wit' me
Leavin' the club laughing like them came wit' me
Cop heavy, feel rhythmatic I rock steady
Regardless of the pussy you can have it I'm not petty
It's plain, never meant for the heart but the brain
Depart from the pain, that's the art of the game
Forgive if I ever did, involve your wiz'
That's no reason for niggas, not to father they kids
I'm don, New Guinea born, city calm, with the Russian varn
Looking pretty, all fitted strong, could see it's me
Who else get head in a Vee?, rock red in the Pee?
Spread hash in the streets?
I'm gone

[Verse 3]
Nothing new, understand this is something we do
Party night, play the dance floor, once in a blue
Me and the crew, prank jewelers, we somethin' to view
Beyond live, we leave all that stuntin' to you
Did the swish shit, and all the mistress
Niggas wives wit' they wrist slit
And still a nigga never did kiss
I'm cold, cris bottles, six bottles
Spit it like and Iceburg novel and chicks follow
Finesse, I move off the love of the sex
And if it's over you can bet my hands is huggin her neck
All the respect never one to try and spoil her rep
But if she stress gotta play the chick more to the left
Money or hoes? can take those from under your nose
Eyes shut like them pros, wit' both of them closed
So niggas what? I'm here to take back, every buck
Every chick, ever fucked, time to stick niggas up
Let's go
