[Verse 1]
I'm on the up and up too hot to touch nigga
The narcs couldn't stop the rush
Smuggled in the package tight
I'm 98 a gram leaving attics nice
I get 5 you dont get half a mic
Been known to cut ass for the added hype
And I pop too much shit to be the marriage type
Get spoiled even when I'm not acting right
Can't nobody come with the style I bring?
Piece hanging on the chain just a dangling
Motorola 2-way so the cell don't ring
Crush R&B and I don't even sing
No reference and no pro tools
Till I'm up in my hersh
I'm a show and prove
Got up in the game and made my own rules
Put heat on the reels until I blow the fuse

Chorus
All Money is Legal Baby
And what, and what
All Money Is Legal Baby
What 'chu thing, what 'chu know abut this
All Money Is Legal Baby
The higher the price
The hotter the rhyme

[Verse 2]
Amilliyon doper than heroin
Shoes got to be Gucci wht the fresh pair on
Spend up doe til its damn near gone
Lay it down get spins all year long
You know I run through them papers quick
You know I rock them glaciers sick
Chilling waiting for these shares to clear
I'm the only hot bich you gonna hear this year
You know I ass kick with no practice
Any joint I'm on automatic classic
Niggas pay me just to do ad-libs
And I move the crowd like I move to Saks Fifth
If I'm a gonna flash rocks then I'm a stash Glocks
If I'm a gonna talk shit
Then I'm a walk it
All money is legal now
I'm with Hov, Bleek and Sigel now

Chorus

[Verse 3]
Give me my cue and I'm ready to roll
Take a little ghetto celebrity stroll
Floss with the minks to heavy to hold
Baggettes be whoa, I gets me doe
I'm an uptown swinger
With the light blue on the pinkie finger
Amilliyon 'bout to shake some ass
I'm crack packed in till it break the glass
Keep crates of papes, in the steel encased safe
Watch doe accumulate like real-estate
And you know I gotta keep tricks up the sleeve
Leav'em bankrupt with blue balls till the dick bleed
Save all receipts write it off quickly
If I'm a ball I'm play up in the big leagues
Never fold when the pressure come
You could put Amil up against the best of 'em

Chorus 2x
