Imagine yourself at the top of mountain, looking for the fountain of youth
Well I been searching all my life and I haven't even found the truth
Til one gold day when I met an old sage and he said that the fountain is you
I said you? He said no you
The fountain of youth it lies inside
So kill all those lies inside
Damn near commit suicide
I said die? He said die
You gotta die a couple times
You're not a body with a soul
You're a soul in a vessel
You think it's gone be simple
But the Lord is gonna test you
So he made your worst enemy
To see if you can channel enough energy
To cleanse the inner you. The inner me
But switch it up, don't give it up
Gotta fight until your health goes
Never fall victim to a part of yourself. No

[Hook]

I told him, this life wasn't made for me
So I gotta zone out. I gotta daydream
But my dreams all turn into nightmares
I swear them devils never fight fair
Wanna make me suffer while I'm here
Then take my soul and take me there
I really don't think I can fight til the end of my life
Not even til the end of the night
I feel like my ends at the end of a knife
That's the only way I see to put an end to the strife
3 people hold onto me
Hope they'll be alright when I leave
He said give yourself back to God
He'll take your soul home
I see that you been waiting for salvation here for so long
You don't know the half, I don't even feel like trying
And who would wanna fight when you're suffering like I am
This is all truth I wish that I could say I'm lying
And who would wanna live, when your living feels like dying?

[Hook]

I said, suicides not a viable option
So why should I drink this concoction?
Tried to put one in my head from a Glock 10
Millimeter automatic, got no options
God got another plan for me and I know this
Gotta stay alive, and I gotta stay focused
Change in your mind frame might not notice
Hell is the hottest but Earth is the coldest
Life ain't nice, neither is a knife
Neither is a gun, nigga neither is a pipe
Tryna stay the course but I just ain't right
Tryna air my thoughts but I just can't write
Tryna love my life but my life don't love me back
But when I leave it'll want me back
And when I spaz it won't react
And the world is gone be black
And I gotta stay alive, gotta keep on living
And I gotta keep trying, gotta keep trying, to be forgiven
Your death is destined from the beginning, and this I know
So I'll wait until my destiny and fate come take me home

[Hook]
