[Verse 1: Rappin' 4-Tay]
Fresh up out the Testarossa
Still buzzing off that sticky green Cali doja
Last night had a gang of them freaky bitches jocking
It's the player himself, going to always keep it poppin'
Ripping them off, pissing them off, scooping and talking and picking them off
Six can get off, I'm kicking it off
Stik Figa my nigga, that's like JT the Bigga Figga
Six-inch stiletto's, pedal to the metal
You damn right we on a whole 'nother level
Benjamins, Franklins, Grants, Jeffersons
And tell a broke bitch, to get to stepping
Ain't no player like the one you got
Another hit from the Bay, it just don't stop
Macking like this ain't easy
She said it take a real player just to please me, bitch

[Chorus: Stik Figa]
Never let a sucka stress me out
Players never talk down, respect the crown
Had to put it in they face, they expect it now
And I don't give them nothing less when I rep the town
Never let a sucka stress me out
Players never talk down, respect the crown
Had to put it in they face, they expect it now
And I don't give them nothing less when I rep the town

[Verse 2: Stik Figa]
Ya see I float like a butterfly, sting like an STD
When you pee, better check them freaks
All I have had was teeth like Ali Shaheed
On point like T-I-P, Phife Rest in Peace
See, I don't trip, maybe I'm old fashioned
Got a new stitch, cut from an old fabric
Tailor made fit, speak when I'm in traffic
I'm in my own lane, follow my own map then
Dripping in sauce, don't call me a lyricist
It ain't about the paper then it ain't that serious
Chill and Netflix it's bliss in the ignorance
Until you side chick text she ain't get her period
I'm still going to drink my Henny with the Coke
I'm still gonna stack my pennies like I'm broke
And I might get chips at different on them bro
While I'm Midwest reppin' with my G from the 'Sco

[Chorus: Stik Figa]
Never let a sucka stress me out
Players never talk down, respect the crown
Had to put it in they face, they expect it now
And I don't give them nothing less when I rep the town
Never let a sucka stress me out
Players never talk down, respect the crown
Had to put it in they face, they expect it now
And I don't give them nothing less when I rep the town

[Outro: Stik Figa]
Get down with the get down
That's just how a nigga get down
Get down with the get down
That's just how a nigga get down
Get down with the get down
That's just how a nigga get down
Get down with the get down
That's just how a nigga get down
