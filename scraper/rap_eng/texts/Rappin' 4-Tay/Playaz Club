[Chorus]
Me and my homies, we're tighter than a glove
We chop a lot of game, that's how we do it at the Playaz Club
Check the pool, or kick it in the tub
'Cause we kick much ass at the Playaz Club

[Verse 1]
I got a ho named Reel-To-Reel
She got a buddy named SP-12, now you know the deal
We gets freaky in the studio late-night
That's why the beats that you hear are comin' real tight
Somethin' to roll to, somethin' to stroll to
If you's a player in the game this'll hold you
More money, more money for the bank roll
Stick to the script, don't slip in the '94
A lot of fools put the salt in the game
To where these women get the notion that they running the game
Huh, I run my own, and I'm my own self-person
No respect make the situation worsen
Fillmore, H.P., and Sunnydale
There's a Playaz Club everywhere you dwell
Lakeview, P.H., and Army Street
A different part of town, a different kind of freak
I just wiggle my toes on a mink rug
And press play on remote at the Playaz Club

[Chorus]
Me and my homies, we're tighter than a glove
We chop a lot of game, that's how we do it at the Playaz Club
Check the pool, or kick it in the tub
'Cause we kick much ass at the Playaz Club
(More champagne, Mr. Forte?)

[Verse 2]
From day one I had to get my money right
Me, Fly, and Frankie J, we took an airplane flight
Huh, they wanted to hear a rap, I said "Alright, bet"
We dropped a beat, I grabbed the mic, and then they wrote a check
A few G's for the pocket, no hesitation
Took a flight back to the Golden State, and
Shops made orders from a whole new capital
The word was gettin' out, 4-Tay's out-rappable
Don't need a Glock, but I bought one just in case
A sucka try to stop me from pursuing my paper chase
Know the chase is on, because it don't stop
I got the beat and got the rap, you make the Glock pop
So treacherous suckas couldn't sweat this on a bad day
By the way, just in case you never heard of Rappin' 4-Tay
I'm on the smooth tip
Never trippin' on them suckas poppin' off at the lip
I pop the top off the drank and we can roll some dank bro
Leave the gat at the house, bring some dominoes
Kick off your shoes, relax, and get a body rub
And shoot your mackin' at these women at the Playaz Club

[Chorus]
Me and my homies, we're tighter than a glove
We chop a lot of game, that's how we do it at the Playaz Club
Check the pool, or kick it in the tub
'Cause we kick much ass at the Playaz Club

[Verse 3]
You can't resist it, but don't get it twisted
V.I.P., that means the number's not listed
Membership is based on clout
And how you carry yourself; now homie, what you all about?
I stack paper and kick it with the O.G.'s
Some got a nine-to-five, some took a lot of kis
You can learn a whole lot from a playa
A lot of these playas make a damn good rhyme-sayer
A lot of people get a misconception
And start drifting in the wrong direction
Miss goody two shoe, I'll see you later
I ain't got time, you ain't nothing but a playa-hater
I'd rather kick it with the crew in Arizona
They chop game like we do in California
Another show, another flow, a new bank account
But cash money comes in large amounts
So get your membership but never slip to lameness fast
Or else Fly will have to tap that ass
And drop you to the ground, and make your knees scrub
It's just an everyday thang at the Playaz Club

[Chorus]
Me and my homies, we're tighter than a glove
We chop a lot of game, that's how we do it in the Playaz Club
Check the pool, or kick it in the tub
'Cause we kick much ass at the Playaz Club
Me and my homies, we're tighter than a glove
We chop a lot of game, that's how we do it at the Playaz Club
Check the pool, or kick it in the tub
'Cause we kick much ass at the Sucka-free Club

[Outro: Rappin' 4 Tay & Lil Fly]
Yeah, I'd like to send this shout out
To all the Playaz Clubs throughout the world
I know they got a Playaz Club in Chicago
Huh, what about that one they got in Philly, Fo'?
You know they got one out there in Atlanta
The way they be choppin' it
You understand, shit; Detroit, New York, Texas
Yeah, but we gonna move on down to these Playaz Clubs
Closer to home, like Seattle, L.A., Bakersfield, San Diego
P.A., V-Town, Richmond, Sacramento
Yeah, but a special shout goes out to the Playaz Club
Right across the water in the Biggity Biggity O
Yeah, and last but definitely not least, yeah
