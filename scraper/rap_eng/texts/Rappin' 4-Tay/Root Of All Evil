[Chorus: San Quinn]
The root of all evil, legal or illegal gettings
People's purposes are shifted
Dollar signs on all our minds
At the core of what's in store for me and my kind
The root of all evil, legal or illegal gettings
People's purposes are shifted
Dollar signs on all our minds
At the core of what's in store for me and my kind

[Verse 1: Rappin' 4-Tay]
You remind me of a toilet, trick
It seems that every time you come around, you're always full of shit
Trying to be somebody you ain't, take a vacation
And slow your roll before you fuck up your reputation
Yes, I'm down with that GLP love
We was rippin' and kickin' it way before the "Playa's Club"
Can't none of you haters keep no talented players like us apart
The Bay's on the map, I knew it from the fuckin' start
They talk down on us, but now they wanna be around us
Hatin' to the fullest extent but guess what
Everybody can't be a GLP member
My niggas are sick as fuck, we're lacing this agenda
Like a relay, so parlay, with a fifth of Marnier
I thought you knew, I'll be around, it's Rappin' 4-Tay
We deliver so game it's getting lethal
So separate yours from mine, busta, trust a, root of all evil

[Chorus: San Quinn]
The root of all evil, legal or illegal gettings
People's purposes are shifted
Dollar signs on all our minds
At the core of what's in store for me and my kind
The root of all evil, legal or illegal gettings
People's purposes are shifted
Dollar signs on all our minds
At the core of what's in store for me and my kind

[Verse 2: JT the Bigga Figga]
Renewing my vessels, causing thresholds on a daily
Niggas faulty but ain't no thang because these suckas can't fade me
I want your undivided attention, the seasons of a winner
The top notch percenters to hop skotch beginners
Begin this apparatus, got the baddest conversation for those
Manipulated, you're froze, so close the doors
Open up your mind for the rattle, niggas shackled like cattle
Disrespected like snitches and rounded up for the battle
Now ask yourself: who's the baddest and the boldest from the shoulders?
The Low be rollin' thickest from the youngsters to the oldest
Legendary in my town when I was packin' my 9
But now I'm packin' my rhyme, it's time to climb
Repenting for my old way of life so now I prosper and it's proper
Thanks to the Most High, no need for my chopper
Back up out my face, there is no equal
Prepare for the sequel, you know what I'm sayin'
The root of all evil

[Chorus: San Quinn]
The root of all evil, legal or illegal gettings
People's purposes are shifted
Dollar signs on all our minds
At the core of what's in store for me and my kind
The root of all evil, legal or illegal gettings
People's purposes are shifted
Dollar signs on all our minds
At the core of what's in store for me and my kind

[Verse 3: San Quinn]
Gang with me, none, my speech won't be long
It's about these felines who do not belong
In the field, the D zone, don't know what page we be on
Everything you see is wrong so it's a must to be strong, yo
Keep your clutch with reality and your salary
Your grip or grab a hold 'fore you end up tore up naturally
The ice cold cizash, the reason why we lose you
Do the dirty job, rob and mob or pop
If everybody had a mil ticket, house and a Lex
Rub off our good game, there'll be no need to bless
Smoke dank for stress, but some fortune, don't have it
Do not grab automatic, and man, if you do not have it
'Cause them homies with the same tats, same scratch broke flat
Got the game confused, don't even know where home at
For the love of money, the earth should make it rain
For the petty pocket change, niggas bring the pain
The root of all evil

[Chorus: San Quinn]
The root of all evil, legal or illegal gettings
People's purposes are shifted
Dollar signs on all our minds
At the core of what's in store for me and my kind
The root of all evil, legal or illegal gettings
People's purposes are shifted
Dollar signs on all our minds
At the core of what's in store for me and my kind

[Verse 4: Playa P]
Five Times Nut, that's my crew
And if you niggas in the field, never ever show no fear, make it clear
For your ear, I spin like a hemisphere
On a reel to reel, some call it a track
Be on the mack, that's a fact, could not lack like that
Knick knack, even a stack for me rap
Snap back, we relax, ready to puff a twamp sack
He probably don't even know the facts
Still packin' a gat on the ump that's wack
Put yourself in a trap 'cause your mind went flat
Put the evil with the devil and you still don't care less
Addicted to the game to try to earn a quick stack
Don't ever think twice, you'd rather take their life
Ain't forgiven by Christ, first of all, down to brawl night
Even against the law, yes y'all, do not take down far
Never to borrow nothin', always hid face, frontin'
And for nothin', bruh bruh
Word to the humbug, play a bee, stung ya with the
Root of all evil
(Legal or illegal gettings, people's purposes are shifted)

[Chorus: San Quinn]
The root of all evil, legal or illegal gettings
People's purposes are shifted
Dollar signs on all our minds
At the core of what's in store for me and my kind
The root of all evil, legal or illegal gettings
People's purposes are shifted
Dollar signs on all our minds
At the core of what's in store for me and my kind
