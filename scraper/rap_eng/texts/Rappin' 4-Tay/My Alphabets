[Verse 1: Suga Free]
(Bah-bah-shabba-da-bah)

That nigga this, that nigga that. Where's Quik? Where's Tone?
Where's Hi-C? When your album coming out, holmes?
I'm more anticipated and most waited on
That I don't a fingernail, or break a sweat, or break a bone
I was born at night, but it wasn't last night
You want a toy to go play with, bitch?
'Cause you're fuckin' with some dynamite
Watch it, 4, gotta get mo'
In Pomona, California or Divisadero
And since you wanna report it?
Yeah, I crushed up some crystal meth, lined it up, and snorted it
Gleek-gleek-bah-dah-shabba-dah-ho
And when a pimp feel he had enough, he need him some mo'
(Hey Suga Free, why you blastin'?)
I don't know, motherfucker
Call that nigga you heard it from and go on and ask him
I'm on parole, cuz, and I ain't into telling
I'm into scientific research, bitch, to keep ya bailing

[Chorus: Suga Free & Rappin' 4-Tay]
Mackin' ain't nothin but a thing to me
'Cause I'm a double OG P-I-M-P
Do you know your alphabet, Suga Free?
A-B-C-P
Mackin' ain't nothin but a thing to me
'Cause I'm a double OG P-I-M-P
Do you know your alphabet, Suga Free?
A-B-C-P

[Verse 2: Mac Dre]
Cut the crap, biatch; you can't con me
I'll slice yo' ass thin as salami
Not Ronnie, Bobby, Ricky or Mike
I go bad like OJ, sav like Ike
Gesundheit, so cold, you sneeze
Iced out grill, tattooed sleeves
Bitch please, me no comprende
All I understand is 'daddy, send me'
I drink RÃ©my Martin
Flows on a cougnut, barking
Old school nigga like Theodore
When I see a whore, I can't ignore
I'm all in her face like an angry coach
Servin' her potions and antidotes
Hop in the Range when it's time to go
She'll do whatever I say, she'll even be my hoe

[Chorus: Suga Free & Rappin' 4-Tay]
Mackin' ain't nothin but a thing to me
'Cause I'm a double OG P-I-M-P
Do you know your alphabet, Suga Free?
Yep, A-B-C-P
Mackin' ain't nothin but a thing to me
'Cause I'm a double OG P-I-M-P
Do you know your alphabet, Suga Free?
A-B-C-P

[Verse 3: Rappin' 4-Tay]
Pimpin's been around since the first day
And I been utilizing my mack hand, swingin' my back hand
Checkin' bitches on the daily, fuckin' with my paper route
If you's a broke bitch, best'a get the fuck out
No disrespect but I'm a mack, that's how the game go
Pimpin' these hoes from Hunters Point to Fillmore
Mac Dre and 4-Tay keep it sucka-free
360 degrees, you feel me, Suga Free?
Dirty dead presidents
Put a safety deposit box at my residence
'Cause real playas stack a grip, can't be hesitant
Maneuver on my cellular
100, 100, 100 mo' profit on the regular
Droptop double-R's, stackin' like Escobar
Gotta get that cheese, Cali niggas do it all
You need garage door opener, haters glancin'
Keepin' the feds off balance, they can't find my mansion

[Chorus: Suga Free & Rappin' 4-Tay]
Mackin' ain't nothin but a thing to me
'Cause I'm a double OG P-I-M-P
Do you know your alphabet, Suga Free?
Yep, A-B-C-P
Mackin' ain't nothin but a thing to me
'Cause I'm a double OG P-I-M-P
Do you know your alphabet, Suga Free?
Yep, A-B-C-P
Mackin' ain't nothin but a thing to me
'Cause I'm a double OG P-I-M-P
Do you know your alphabet, Suga Free?
A-B-C-P
Mackin' ain't nothin but a thing to me
'Cause I'm a double OG P-I-M-P
Do you know your alphabet, Suga Free?
A-B-C-P
