[Intro: Rappin' 4-Tay]
LiL' G., You Struck It Rich What Would You Do?
Hey It's Ya Boy 4-Tay

[LiL' Gang$ta]
It's LiL' G

[Rappin' 4-Tay]
Talk To Em Lil' G

[Hook: LiL' Gang$ta] Picture A Nigga Richer Then Rich, And It's All Legit, What Would You Do, With All That Cash, Spend It On A Trick, Or Would You Go Back And Try To Save The World, Save The Starving Little Girls, Or Would You Save Yourself

[Verse 1: Lil' Gang$ta]
Picture A Nigga Richer Then Rich, And It's All Legit, What Would You Do, With All That Cash, Spend It On A Trick, Or Would You Go Back And Try To Save The World, Save The Starving Little Girls, Or Would You Save Yourself?
Try To Buy All The Latest Fashions Until Your Out Of Wealth, Or Would Your Plans Be Different Try To Invest In Some Shit
Until Your Money Starts Falling Then You Gotta Re-Up Quick, Duck The Feds Cause, Who Want's To Be Indited Bitch!
Me And My Niggas Steady Making Plans, New Shit's In Demand, And Niggas Want It, I Go Get It
Wit This Money Call Me Sonny And I Need My Cher, So I Can Keep Stackin' This Bread, An I Never Need Nair Cause I Can Feel It In The Air
Come Up To A Nigga Cause I'll Always Be There

[Hook X3: LiL' Gang$ta] Picture A Nigga Richer Then Rich, And It's All Legit, What Would You Do, With All That Cash, Spend It On A Trick, Or Would You Go Back And Try To Save The World, Save The Starving Little Girls, Or Would You Save Yourself

[Verse 2: Rappin' 4-Tay]
What Would You Do If You Struck It Rich, Hundred Tickets, Multiple Digits, Would You Keep It, Or Would You Split It
Look Out For The Love Ones, Keep A Door Open Of Opportunity, Or Would You Make An Investment For Your Own Community?
Me I Give Back To The Needy, Try To Help This Crisis, Plug The Unfortunate Hope They Keep It Righteous
Give A Function For The Homeless And Feed Em All, Open A Foundation Try To Greet Em All, But Of Course GOD's First
Off Top That's 10 Percent, We Call It Paying Ties Ya'll Best To Represent, And The Family They Get Broke Off And That's Forsure
But Don't Take My Kindness For Weakness Cause I Really Blow

[Hook X2: LiL' Gang$ta] Picture A Nigga Richer Then Rich, And It's All Legit, What Would You Do, With All That Cash, Spend It On A Trick, Or Would You Go Back And Try To Save The World, Save The Starving Little Girls, Or Would You Save Yourself
