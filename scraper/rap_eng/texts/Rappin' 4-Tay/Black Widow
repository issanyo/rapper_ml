[Hook: J Minixx]
She's dangerous; black widow
The kind of girl you don't want to fuck with
Sometimes she's loud, sometimes she's quiet
I take her, with me, everywhere I go
Ain't nothing but cold, everywhere I go

[Verse 1: Rappin' 4-Tay]
Check like a more ass than law loud on here
So freaky that I gotta keep an extra dick for her
Keep her everywhere I go, sorta like a black hawk
Man this's my main bitch, and that ain't no back talk
It's just me and my girlfriend, we stable, yeah
Call her the problem solver - unfaithful
Never catch an attitude, cause I keep a load
And she goes straight to the point, it's never ever sugar coated
Ride or die with me if I squeeze her right
Painin' when I'm aimin' she gon' back in the heat of the night
Step out ya lane, I wish ya nigga would
Baby be havin' me fillin' like Clint Eastwood
Jackas be clocked me out to get me but
I ain't taking no losses, why you think I keep her with me?
Her name is A.K., she got a sister named Nina
They make the front page new, you probably seen her

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Benni Boom]
This the one that never wanna leave me alone
She liked to walk when there's beef so you know that I never wanna keep her home
Damn, I know she lie
But every time when she talk, she always controls the cry
She my main bitch on the playground
And she ain't takin' up life, man, it's Graham
I stay bound, to The West
Never beating the gun smoke to my chest
Locked can't get drama, leave it to the mama
When I have ya chopped up like Beni Hana
She might as well be the spouse
But she be comin' with me, every time I leave the house
She be down as the Devil start
If you fucking with Benni, you puttin' hoes in your heart
Man she dangerous, she a black widow
I like to leave her in bed, under my black pillow

[Hook]
