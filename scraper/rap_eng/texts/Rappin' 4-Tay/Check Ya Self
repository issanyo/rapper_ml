[Hook]
You best to check yo' self before you wreck yo' self
(Why?)
Because that playa hating is bad for yo' health
I got mine, shit you best to get yo' grip
Got tired of them haters talking all that shit

[Verse 1]
Rich thick chocolate
King size candy bar
Keep that on the D.L. like TLC
I'm, known for knocking panties them Grammy's is what I craving
Gold on top of platinum, bitches best to when
Players get to macking about this shit
So gripy when the nifty ski skirts like 40 Water and the Clizzick
Overseas [?] passports, knock knock
Who's there? The Player's Club, 4-Tay and 2Pac
With more game then Chuck Woolery, fuck Parker Brothers
Checkmate, you bit the bait you stupid motherfucker
Knocking haters out like Mike Tyson
Ping-Ping-Ping, two million men keep rising
If you're on the reala for the skrilla fool don't hesitate
Black on everything, devils like to infiltrate
By all means playa
Repelling for them haters niggero
This here's a matter of life and death shit so

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
OJ beat the case, Mike we know they think you did it
Probably won't admit it, but still he got acquitted
Sex money and murder, you probably never heard of a
Embezzlement to flip to selling with moms, you're hurting her
The type of dope that keeps you rocking like a dope fiend
Them devils got my sisters tripping off that Thorazine
Don't want no drama
I don't wanna have to kill nobody
Today a child was born plus another dead body
So thank the Lord you wasn't a victim of the dirty strap
This world is [?], you got my back? I got yo' back
Street life blues
Four in the morning, snooze you lose
See devil's smoking and joking, this shit is hurting fool

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
I'm trying to pimp the system like Mike
And use my brilliance
Fill out my writer's clearance
And rush my mom a million
Dollars pop my collar like a scholar, some ole playa shit
My brother's getting pumps, flipping the script on scholarships
Even the one's that's slanging and hanging
And man they can't stop banging
Everybody that did some dirt
So kid's don't talk to strangers
I don't want you to be like me
I just want you to be yourself
Man always see too much hustlers struggling, keep game in check
