I wanna muse you, not confuse you
Later on, I might wanna use you
For about an hour, me and my power
It doesn't matter if you scream and holler
Cause I'm bigging, when I'm digging
You wanna stop? You must be kidding
The best is yet to come, hit the kick drum
Keep dancing 'till your feet get numb
Rely on the 4, the T, the A, the Y guy
I'm so fresh and if you wanna know why
Then listen. I'm never missing
Suckas be dissing, they're never pissing
Me off track
Cause I'm much bigger than that
If you're not moving your feet
Something's wrong, my job is not complete
Let the DJ spin the wheels
While I test my lyrical skills, that's real
This is the one I made to kick the fresh sound
You new homies can put your mack hand down
And bump the beat all day in your ride
It gets real ill on the other side
Hold it, pause, keep that position
Cut the beat cause I got a proposition
If I can promise to rap to the right stuff
You can sweat and get wet enough
I mean really though
Maybe I can put you in my video
I'm popping cause I must not confuse you
