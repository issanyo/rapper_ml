No I can't run, I can't hide from all this pressure
If I sell out that means I'm copping to a lesser charge
And whenever there's a will baby, there's a way
Each one teach one, I always say
The murder rate is rising, soceity ain't scaring me
Life is like a puzzle, ain't no telling when they'll bury be
They wanna tell me how to live
But I got dues to pay, now how much money you gon' give
For my PG and me bill, cause it's a week late
Leave the hustle alone, fool, don't procastanate
Cause I'm a get mine, and that's the way I was taught
Fool, now what you thought
That I was born and raised in a big house
While you would sleep up in the bed, I slept on the couch
I tried to study, but was often interrupted
Because the nieghborhood I'm from is so corrupted
Rats and roaches creeping through the cracks in my walls
While my folks down the street breaking plain and ball
Trying to count as much as they can count is like hell
Is kind of hard being raised off up in the cell
Get on your own, and get you some bizness, black
Stay sucker-free, and by all means, watch your back
You ain't gotta listen, but take it from your boy 4-Tay
Fool, you think you pormised another day?

Each peice of life is like a puzzle, can you slove 'em
Stress 'll drive you crazy tryin to deal with these problems
Problems, problems, how you gon' solve 'em
Man, I'm going crazy trying to deal with these problems

Each and every day on these streets, game is getting sicker
Thicker than a King-size snicker
And I know who's got the plug, don't need no witness
Cause your bizness ain't everybody elses bizness
Snitchers, and gothams, and gangstas, they're so keniving
In 1995, only the strong will survive and
Everytime I open up somethin', somebody wants some
So I could be broke, all on my lonesome
Too many critics, too many debators
And when they don't hire us, that makes me think they hate us
But that's just anothre problem pushing through my brain
That wouldn't change no matter how much I complained
How would you care if I was living on welfare
You act like you gon' move me and my family elsewhere
Allow me to make this conversation more concrete
Too many formalitys, and I find that so obsolete
But I'm a keep striving, cause it couldn't get no worse
Ain't robbing no banks or snatching nobody's purse
I finally made me a profit, so now I can really chill
Check my mailbox, Oh, too soon , there's my phone bill
Trying to look up for number 1, and that's my mother
If it ain't one thing fly, it's another

Each peice of life is like a puzzle, can you solve 'em
Stress 'll drive you crazy when your dealing with these problems
Problems, problems, how you gon' solve 'em
Man I'm going crazy tryin to deal with these problems

Each peice of life is like a puzzle, can you solve 'em
Stress 'll drive you crazy trying to deal with these problems
Problems, problems, how you gon' solve 'em
Man I'm going crazy trying to deal with these problems
Problems, problems, how you gon' solve 'em
I'm a handle mine
Problems, problems, how you gon' solve 'em
Take 'em one at a time
