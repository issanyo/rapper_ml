[Intro]
Police stay infiltrating
But us black folks really infiltrating our damn self you know what I'm saying?
So we just gotta roll with the punches
And be prepared for anything come along our way, you know?

[Verse 1]
I had it hard I remember it all, mane
No need to purp, I had to work a proper plan
Because my mama, she was workin' and cookin' and doin' it all
Washin' my cloths, cleaning my nose, scrubbin' the floor, scrubbing the walls
She said "whatever you do with your life, just do it properly
And maybe one day you own your own business and buy some property"
My momma schooled me with the game oh yes she laced me
So all them sheisty suckers up in the town, they couldn't fade me
Still can't, I clock bank, I'm potent like a spliff
You know why? Because the good lord gave me the gift

[Refrain]
I don't know what you can do
(He gave me the gift to spit, the gift to keep the crowd rowdy)
Whatever it is make sure it's good for you
(I'm tryna control my scene, it's me and my friend in the room cloudy)
A butcher, a baker, a candlestickmaker
(He gave me the gift to spit, the gift to keep the crowd rowdy)
Whatever
(I'm tryna control my scene, it's me and my friend in the room cloudy)
I don't know what you can do
Whatever it is make sure it's good for you
(He gave me the gift to spit, the gift to keep the crowd rowdy)
A butcher, a baker, a candlestickmaker
(I'm tryna control my scene, it's me and my friend in the room cloudy)
You know the rhyme

[Verse 2]
How would I rap, how would I rhyme?
How would I get me some peace of mind?
I'm thanking the lord, I'm having a [?]
For pulling this shit that I pulled before
Laughing and gaffing at criminal minded
Federal agents follow me 24/7, I pop my spot but they can't find it
And they're so mad cause I'm shaking em, breaking em, taking em, yes I'm swift
You know why? Because the good lord gave me the gift

[Refrain]
I don't know what you can do
(He gave me the gift to spit, the gift to keep the crowd rowdy)
Whatever it is make sure it's good for you
(I'm tryna control my scene, it's me and my friend in the room cloudy)
A butcher, a butcher, a candlestickmaker
(He gave me the gift to spit, the gift to keep the crowd rowdy)
Whatever
(I'm tryna control my scene, it's me and my friend in the room cloudy)
I don't know what you can do
Whatever it is make sure it's good for you
(He gave me the gift to spit, the gift to keep the crowd rowdy)
A butcher, a baker, a candlestickmaker
(I'm tryna control my scene, it's me and my friend in the room cloudy)
You know the rhyme

[Verse 3]
Chilling in home like a zone, reminding myself of Al Capone
Cause soon as some drama comes up in my face, I'm telling you nigga it's on
And the lad [?] the young ones
Slanging and banging and hanging out on the turf, don't be the sprung one, the dumb one
Who follow the leader? You be the leader so we can achieve what goal be
Cause I tell you my brother there's nothing as good as keeping your ass off parole
You gotta do what you got's to do, you gotta hustle
Just remember the circumstances brother, life is just like a puzzle
I'm dropping something that you can relax your mind to
It ain't no ratatatat, you go with the gat, I roll with the Ragtop crew
Just a gang of the riggidy rap so we can lift up out of the five-o face
And tell them that the Good Lord gave me the gift

[Refrain]
I don't know what you can do
(He gave me the gift to spit, the gift to keep the crowd rowdy)
Whatever it is make sure it's good for you
(I'm tryna control my scene, it's me and my friend in the room cloudy)
A butcher, a baker, a candlestickmaker
(He gave me the gift to spit, the gift to keep the crowd rowdy)
Whatever
(I'm tryna control my scene, it's me and my friend in the room cloudy)
I don't know what you can do
Whatever it is make sure it's good for you
(He gave me the gift to spit, the gift to keep the crowd rowdy)
A butcher, a baker, a candlestickmaker
(I'm tryna control my scene, it's me and my friend in the room cloudy)
You know the rhyme

[Outro]
He gave me
The gift, the gift to sang
He gave me
The gift, the gift to sang
To do my thing whenever I want
To sing I'm sorry, make things go right
Oh yeah, yeah yeah yeah
(He gave me the gift to spit, the gift to keep the crowd rowdy)
Listen to this
He gave me the voice to sang
(I'm tryna control my scene, it's me and my friend in the room cloudy)
Oh yeah
The same way 4-Tay is doing his thang
(He gave me the gift to spit, the gift to keep the crowd rowdy)
He gave me the voice to sang
