[Phone rings]
Lady: Ragtop records, may I help you?
Fly: Can I speak to Fo?
Lady: One moment please, he's around
4-Tay: Yo, wassup?
Fly: Wassup, Fo? I know you finished that cut for the radio
4-Tay: As a matter of fact Fly I just finished it baby boy, no worry about nothin', I'll be around

Regardless if I'm chillin' backstage or on tour
With my homie Young Fly even Al B. Sure
Never hesitate to call me after I'm done
'Cause homie I'm real and always true to my loved ones
Too many wakes and funerals full of tears
You say there's something on your mind, well hey, I'm all ears
'Cause ain't nobody thinking about the funk that you're choosin' it
A lot of my homies stuck in the pen for life or losin' it
Call up your folks you keep thinkin' about home
Recorder keeps a peep and there's a block on the phone
And all of this is enough to make a brother's nerves bad
Reminds me of a situation that I once had
Spent that, spent this endless relentless tremendous women on my jock
And don't nobody mind their business
He say she say throwin' salt about it
And chooses to talk about you cause there's no one else to talk about
Talk about the show and the flow and all the clout
Then be real with yourself and talk about and turned it out
It's not hard to compete when his name is poppin'
A scared man can never win that's why I stay clockin'
Fools be huffin' and puffin' don't wanna see me about nothin' I'm down
And if you ever need me Fly: I'll be around

[Hook]
Whenever you call me: I'll be there
Whenever you want me: I'll be there
Whenever you need me: I'll be there
I'll be around

Life ain't based on peaches and cream
This new generation lost a whole lot of dreams
Future doctors, producers, and mothers
The list goes on but now we killin' our brothers
And if we killin' our brothers that means we killin' our own kind
These kids is watchin' now it goes to their mind
Rat-tat-a-tat cause you got a gat
Then they want a gat you livin' like that?
Moms ain't cookin' she worked the week straight
If anything she's the one deserves a hot plate
The ghetto, the ghetto ain't nothin' to dream about
Tryin' to get out now that's somethin' to think about
Fools might disagree but I'm a stay sucka free
Now I'm so black and so strong they can't fade me
Blacks are blacks worst enemy there's still no remedy
You got me for a grip do you call yourself kin of me?
Jealousy, envy, I see it in your eyes
Tell me what's wrong with seeing a black man rise
I keep it funky it's pretty hard to miss it now it is not explicit
A message for the mind, and a moral for statistics
So I'm doin' what we call a roll call
Talkin' about the ones who won't rap then take a downfall
I spit the street life and then I go underground
You silly, it's called versatility and I'll be around

[Hook]

Things are gettin' crucial you gotta exercise your mind
Or learn about life before you're left behind
But how you gonna get it right when you're not doin' right
When you get mad all you want is a gunfight
This tension causes a gang of madness
Now you want funk that results to sadness
Sadness results to a lot of revenge
And your so called friends really ain't your friends
So how do you know who you're able to trust
If you think about the past look what happened to us
I never trust no one, I only trust myself
Or I would've been a victim like everyone else
In friendship or hardship whenever you need me
Just give me a call G I won't deceive thee
These fools be shakin' best believe they're fakin'
Just tryin' to get a grip of all the money you're makin'
This ain't race a mind is a terrible thing to waste
I drop the rap and J drops the bass
To the flow cause ain't nobody get with Fo
I'm a down young brother comin' straight outta Frisco
Droppin' a message out of love to your town
Love your brothers and sisters and I'll be around

[Hook]
