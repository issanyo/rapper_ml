[Chorus: JT the Bigga Figga]
Did you get the dank? Did you get the dank dank?
Yeah, I got the dank
You got the gas on the tank tank?
Did you get the dank? Did you get the dank dank?
Nigga, you don’t fade, you don’t smoke
Did you get the dank? Did you get the dank dank?
Yeah, I got the dank
You got the gas on the tank?
Did you get the dank? Did you get the dank?
Nigga, you don’t fade, you don’t smoke

[Verse 1: JT the Bigga Figga]
Yeah, I’m gon’ fade ‘cause I got the fat blunt
Cerwin Vega, baby, going one on one
Strikin’ 580, headed to the funky Bay
Gots to get my J card, scan another fat stack of posters
I need to roast another spliff
But I can’t smoke a spliff because my boy got the shit
Now I’m just rolling in a bucket with an empty blunt
Waiting on a page from my homie ‘cause he got the gun
Did I say gun? I meant to say bomb
Went to the spot, jumped in the drop, sticky green dank in my palm
Tree, for me, is what you need to know
‘Cause I don’t give a damn when I’m puffin’ on some indio
So don’t ya front when we get to the bank
I’ma ask you one time: did you get the dank?
And if you got the dank, you was cool
But if you didn’t get the dank, you best’a go back to school

[Chorus: JT the Bigga Figga]
Did you get the dank? Did you get the dank?
Yeah, I got the dank
You got the gas on the tank tank?
Did you get the dank? Did you get the dank dank?
Nigga, you don’t fade, you don’t smoke
Did you get the dank? Did you get the dank?
Yeah, I got the dank
You got the gas on the tank?
Did you get the dank? Did you get the dank?
Nigga, you don’t fade, you don’t smoke

[Verse 2: Rappin’ 4-Tay]
I got the gas on the tank, so fuck it
I’m rolling me up some chronic with my nigga, so what’s up with it?
Twist me up a fat one even though we just smoked one
And we takin’ it to the liquor store to grab us some cold ones
‘Cause J, I got the dank, we got the bank, you got the strap?
‘Cause ain’t no tellin’ when niggas be dwellin’ and willin’ to bust a cap
Keep your composure off the doja, my vision’s double exposure
From huffin’ and puffin’ and passin’ the stuff and I got the shit, I told ya
We could twist a 20 sack, a eighth or twist a quarter
Cut the blunt in the middle and place the shit and that’ll hold ya
And if the 40 don’t get ya, the other blunt’ll hit ya
So pass the muthafucka ‘cause you know the 4 is wit’cha
Damn, we do this often, that indo got me coughin’
And laughin’ off that Miller Draft and homie snortin’ soft and
Highway 101, here we come, we comin’ sick
Always drivin’, 41-fivin’, you know we got the shit
Bumpin’ it in the trunk and every time I smell that skunk, I pull a stunt
And grab a blunt, I ain’t no punk, blaze another one (another one)
And if you got the dank, you’s a G
And if you didn’t, nigga, how you gon’ kick it with me?

[Chorus: JT the Bigga Figga]
Did you get the dank? Did you get the dank?
Yeah, I got the dank
You got the gas on the tank tank?
Did you get the dank? Did you get the dank?
Nigga, you don’t fade, you don’t smoke

[Verse 3: JT the Bigga Figga]
Now when you’re puffin’ on dank, and you’re drankin’ on drank
And you’re headed to the party and you’re low on your tank
Got your zags and your vega on your keyholder
And the nigga in the back is a freeloader
No way that you hopped in my shit and you pop at them chicks
And you puffed up so quick, now you can’t cough up them grits
Checked your mail on the first, it ain’t no need here to curse
Just go and give up my money, mayne, before worst things comes to worse
‘Cause everybody else is gone, it’s a long, long way from home
So you better give up that cash or drop your ass over by that phone
‘Cause niggas always play the broke role
But, man, out on the streets, mayne, it’s so cold
So when your ducats in your pocket, don’t try to lock it
‘Cause the drank’ll you’re your ass outer space like a rocket
So don’t ya front when we get to the bank
I’ma ask you one time, nigga: did you get the dank?

[Chorus: JT the Bigga Figga]
Did you get the dank? Did you get the dank?
Yeah, I got the dank
You got the gas on the tank?
Did you get the dank? Did you get the dank?
Nigga, you don’t fade, you don’t smoke
Did you get the dank? Did you get the dank?
Yeah, I got the dank
You got the gas on the tank?
Did you get the dank? Did you get the dank?
Nigga, you don’t fade, you don’t smoke
