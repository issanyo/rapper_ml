[Chorus: Mercston]
'Nuff times I
Gotta escape to get my mind right
In the limelight
The light can be too bright for your eyesight
But I'm ready for the flash
Anytime that I pull up inna my ride
I'm the man right now
See your girlfriend giving me the side eye
RIP to the pussy cuh
I beat it up all night
A man said he's gonna do me something
But I ain't see nuttin' all now
All now, yeah, yeah, yeah
All now
All now, yeah, yeah, yeah
All now

[Verse 1: Mercston]
Been about from all in
'Bout the time they started the congestion
My daddy wasn't even 40
Now he's talking 'bout an early pension
All eyes on my entrance
Chain reaction, not a chain or a pendant
Never been signed, manaman are independent
Gotta do it bigger than big for my descendants
Friday night, I've got styles paying girls [?]
Could've been a dose, could've been a shape-up
Body tilt but the waistline waver
Left the club and she told me to wait for her
Man are tryna be faithful
But if she wanna let me cane then I'm more than able
On a level, limelight ain't what it's cracked to be
A lot of time, the fame level don't match the P

[Chorus: Mercston]
'Nuff times I
Gotta escape to get my mind right
In the limelight
The light can be too bright for your eyesight
But I'm ready for the flash
Anytime that I pull up inna my ride
I'm the man right now
See your girlfriend giving me the side eye
RIP to the pussy cuh
I beat it up all night
A man said he's gonna do me something
But I ain't see nuttin' all now
All now, yeah, yeah, yeah
All now
All now, yeah, yeah, yeah
All now

[Verse 2: Chip]
I used to hate smokers, now I toke it down
Got pagans linking up to try break me down
He said he sounds the 'matic, I ain't heard no rounds
Chip's back with that Illmatic, you can hate me now
On a bars tip
North side niggas that I par with
I hear niggas wanna roll on me
Fuck you and whoever you in the car with, I'm still laughing, cuh
Since Wiley made "Gangsters"
Chippy, I know who's gangster
Coming at Chipmunk, that's not gangster
Gangster, go at a gangster
Trust me daddy, I rated them
Right now, man can't take the pen
'06 times, couldn't take me then
You can't take me now? Ayy bwoy, take the gems
Fuck advice, fuck what they're telling me
Man want my shoes, could you cope with the jealousy?
Niggas chat shit but they know I'm nice
Could blow my own trumpet or phone your spice, yeah

[Chorus: Mercston]
'Nuff times I
Gotta escape to get my mind right
In the limelight
The light can be too bright for your eyesight
But I'm ready for the flash
Anytime that I pull up inna my ride
I'm the man right now
See your girlfriend giving me the side eye
RIP to the pussy cuh
I beat it up all night
A man said he's gonna do me something
But I ain't see nuttin' all now
All now, yeah, yeah, yeah
All now
All now, yeah, yeah, yeah
All now

[Verse 3: Mercston]
Back to back, getting back to facts, I'm like
I was in the flat, she was looking through the catflap
Probably in your manor with [?] in a hatchback
Two tings, one had a batty and one had mad racks
Told Ghetts bring the Ducati and let it backpack
I was in the carnival and seen a brudda snatch that
No time for the red-eye niggas
Pull my corn out, live and let die, nigga
I ain't inna bad vibes, Chip, bun an incence
Bun out the bad aura, I'm on my king shit
Might've done a ting with your girl, but never lipsed it
In my yard, playing Adele, then I depict it
I could be ghost before I ghost, get the power
Build an empire, let it blossom like a flower
Any day, any fucking time of the hour
I'm probably not about, star

[Outro: Mercston]
'Nuff times I
Gotta escape to get my mind right
