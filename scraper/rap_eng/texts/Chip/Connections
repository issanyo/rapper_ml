[Hook]
Every time we touch I get this feeling
Every time we kiss I swear I can fly
Can't you hear my heart beat fast I want this to last
Need you by my side
Cause every time we touch I feel exotic
And every time we kiss I reach for the sky
Can't you feel my heart beat slow I can't let you go
Want you in my life

[Verse 1 - Chip]
When we started I would not kiss
Now girl look I'm all used to your lips
Other girls hate and say that I play
But I know that you're used to the pricks
When we touch my heart skips 2 beats
I don't care if I'm sounding too sweet
When we hug I feel the connection
Like the way that we feel so unique
I never thought that I would find love
I found a wifey and you found hubs
Right now my feelings are so strong
I could put them in a ring but without the gloves
Girl I'm a be here till the end
Not just lovers we're also friends
I won't lie there's pretty girls that I talk to but things ain't the same

[Hook]
Every time we touch I get this feeling
Every time we kiss I swear I can fly
Can't you hear my heart beat fast I want this to last
Need you by my side
Cause every time we touch I feel exotic
And every time we kiss I reach for the sky
Can't you feel my heart beat slow I can't let you go
Want you in my life

[Verse 2 - Tinie Tempah]
You knew I weren't on the kiss bit
I tried to use all excuses
Like I can't kiss you with a lip ring
But before me, you coulda linked bare mans
So I don't know where your lips been
I used to say no like you were listening
But still you seat on the seat
When I needed that kiss on the cheek
You put music like this on repeat
And you prayed for the moment
I used to say wait for old man huh
And the horseman
But one day you came too close
And I moved too slow
I see the feeling man it was too dough
So boy I can understand what you mean in the chorus

[Hook]
Every time we touch I get this feeling
Every time we kiss I swear I can fly
Can't you hear my heart beat fast I want this to last
Need you by my side
Cause every time we touch I feel exotic
And every time we kiss I reach for the sky
Can't you feel my heart beat slow I can't let you go
Want you in my life
