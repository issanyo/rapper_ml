[Intro: Chip]
All this weed all this drink

[Hook: Chip]
All this weed all this drink
Can't be good for my liver and lungs
But I ain't stopping no
I know she fucking other nigga's, true
But I don't care I'm still hitting that pussy
See I ain't stopping no
It's like I'm sinning but winning
I'mma need forgiving
I know she's got a man
She's shown me from the beginning
Lonely night's got me raving all the time
This is me I'm addicted to this life
Yes I'm young and I'm reckless

[Verse 1: Chip]
Uhh
I been smoking amnesia
Kinda fucks with my brain
I'll remember the pussy but won't remember your name
And I ain't breeding up a girl out raving you mad
I'm fucking tonight, next day she pushing your pram (Pissed)
North side but I know south dons
So I might go down south don
You should know what to put your mouth on
Sure I made a go down south song
With Krept and Kone
They next to blow
When they thought they had me I switch the flow
Nigga's gassed up, Texaco
Pussy I got the fire for your petrol
I'm extra terrestrial
I want a bad bitch I'm on pet petrol
I was in class while they were selling class
Now they ain't in my class, class
VIP thats chip
No beans just chips
Got the weed, got the rizzler
But there's no spliff without chip

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Konan]
Yeah
Should have saw her waist, Ass phat
Told her throw it back like its Thursday
Cold hearted had to get the body warmer out nigga
North face, but I'm a south nigga
See the smoke through the crowd
Tell me how can I be quiet
When I'm smoking on that loud
We don't ever turn down
Get money fuck a bitch nigga
First I get the bird's eye
Then she give me fish fingers, arghh
Stop acting like a diva
Say your pussy tight
I don't like spending money either
I ain't going home on my own
My cup full of patron, patron
Your wifey calling  my phone
Cos what's ice cream without cone

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Krept]
Krept, young, reckless, live like a G
Kone and Chip got the weed
I sip goose cos it represents me
Goose backwards is double O G
Get her cards and go clubs
Win girls hearts, it's all nuts
Buy spades, flash diamonds
Jack mans queen, it's all fucked
South nigga but I know north niggers
So I might go up north nigga
Krept, Kone, Chip we corporate
And hoes want to fuck with the fortunate
Go prada man blew a bag
Obama the way I blew a rag
It's all mad side chicks complaining
Deserted her cos she weren't my main ting
Boys still chatting garbage
Nail her then I varnish
The girls that I fuck once
They get whipped and I get car sick
True them honeys on the chill
Spoon with the honey like a meal
Don't get twisted still move trill
Fizzy man up, leave man still, blah

[Hook]
