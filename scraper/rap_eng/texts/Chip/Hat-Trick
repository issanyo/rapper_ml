[Intro]
Call me hat-trick hero
Cuz
London boy settings
0208, 0207
Line up the miemies dem
Mad

[Verse]
Young Gunner going Super Saiyan levels on him
Man United with the flow, I done the treble on him
I'm sidetracked, boy this wasn't my plan
But I can cook up sidetracks for a sideman
Lyrically I can catch me a corpse and
I ain't pretending I can't hear when you're talking
God over everyting, Christians taught him
The Devil comes in disguise but I caught him
Blud why you bloffin'
'Bo trust me they ain't on nuttin'
Chippy had bars from a young'un
You came at me and kept comin' and comin' and comin'
I preed it, he's done now, I'll done him, I'll son him
Don't get mad when I cuss you
Jump on me to grow, I'm not no Mario mushroom
Big up all the DJs, the ones who play fair
When it comes to wordplay, boy don't play here
This is London
Fresh out the dungeon
I ain't gotta scream it, niggas know where I come from
BET Cypher, you cancelled yours, yeah?
True you feel that Chipmunk spirit in the air
You ain't ready, I sweeeear
Cuz, why did you risk it?
Looking like Kylie Jenner, with your big lips
Fire In the Booth debate, the fish bit
Hunger Games - don't test Haringey district
Fuck, look at the power of the internet nigga
Never seen him in my life, he's just an internet figure
I watched NFTR but that's another story
I wish they had the lie detector test like Maury
Back to you now, my lion, you're getting more G
I dunno what drugs you sell but buy more G
Yeah I had 2 2 songs that are corny
Still a green giant with the pen, you can't corn me
You ain't got a plaque, miss me with all the chart talk
Now I gotta boogie with the devil on the dancefloor
Dumb guys can't have me in a art war
School of grime or school of crime, he's an arsehole
Man wanna come up easy, that's all sleazy
You can get three in a week - bun your EP
Sat back, preed it, lined him up neatly
Somebody should've told you
Chippy 'im nah easy

[Outro]
Trust me, I don't wanna hear nuttin' 'bout no five months
After you jumped in suttin' that don't even concern you
Preein' my life for YEARS. From "Who Are You?" to now, how many's that cuz?
Come on cuz! Furthermore, I hope all your gyaldem friendzone you - straight
Cah you're dealing with some haterade ting...and we don't sip that round here rudeboy - you get me?
