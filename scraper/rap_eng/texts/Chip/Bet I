[Verse 1: August Alsina]
I had one too many, two too many, three too many
Four too many, wait a minute, can't remember
Girl if you have any of that Goose and Henney
So let's go to my table, why? Cause I got plenty

[Pre-Hook: August Alsina]
See I got way too many bottles, girls looking like models
And they all in my section, like they tryna get naked
That's why I keep 'em sipping, so later they'll be stripping
And all my niggas faded, so all my niggas tipping

[Hook: August Alsina]
I bet I can turn your girl into a stripper, tonight
I bet I can turn your girl into a stripper, tonight
Bet she gonna back it up, bet she gonna turn it round
Bet she gonna grab the top of that pole before she hit the ground
Cause I bet I can turn your girl into a stripper tonight

[Verse 2: August Alsina]
Do I have any takers? Shout out to my haters
Who think they gonna go shake it, bottom line, let's face it
I'm too real, I can't fake it, it's great here, I'm gon' break it
And please don't be mistaken, if I throw it up she gon' take it

[Pre-Hook: August Alsina]
See I got way too many bottles, girls looking like models
And they all in my section, like they tryna get naked
That's why I keep 'em sipping, so later they'll be stripping
And all my niggas faded, so all my niggas tipping

[Hook: August Alsina]
I bet I can turn your girl into a stripper, tonight
I bet I can turn your girl into a stripper, tonight
Bet she gonna back it up, bet she gonna turn it round
Bet she gonna grab the top of that pole before she hit the ground
Cause I bet I can turn your girl into a stripper tonight

[Verse 3: Chip]
I turn your bitch to a stripper, that's why I learn to get women
And if she bad I'mma tip her, hunneds fifties and twenties
Me and my niggas we spending, get it right back, we ain't tripping
Love the way she drop it down from the top of the ceiling
Now what a wonderful feeling, make it count on a mill
Rest in peace to Chad Butler, it's the return of the trill
You know my wrist is on chill, caught her on that pole
I pull up in that 6, she with me and we gone

[Hook: August Alsina]
I bet I can turn your girl into a stripper, tonight
I bet I can turn your girl into a stripper, tonight
Bet she gonna back it up, bet she gonna turn it round
Bet she gonna grab the top of that pole before she hit the ground
Cause I bet I can turn your girl into a stripper tonight
I bet I can turn your girl into a stripper, tonight
I bet I can turn your girl into a stripper, tonight
Bet she gonna back it up, bet she gonna turn it round
Bet she gonna grab the top of that pole before she hit the ground
Cause I bet I can turn your girl into a stripper tonight
