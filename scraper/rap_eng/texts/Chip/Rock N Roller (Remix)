Roll
Roll, roll, roll, roll, roll, roll, rock and roll
Roll, roll... Remix

[Devlin]
Listen...
When I drop bars in the rave on the stage and it's over
D E V the rock n roller, and you can say I've got colourful cash
Cus mumma need see more shades than Crayola
And what you know about all night parties
J.D. and Brandy girls takin' man deep
Gettin' so drunk that you can't understand me, I ride it
Dev's the rock n roller, I will with my soldiers, they revolve around me
And I'll, let you know, we we're dressed fresh from head to toe
I'll lay a bet on the next to blow, 'cus as well as having septic flows
I'm whiter than December snow, but hate what you know
That's just how I rock n roll, Dev's on O.T.,
Showin' it the whole scene throw


[Kano]
When we hit the town we paint that red
Standing on tables and kicking down chairs
Cause that's just rock and roll
That's just rock and roll

My credit don't crunch, my swagger's insane
No blue suede shoes
Just my Adidas trainers but I'm still rock and roll
Lord knows I'm rock and roll
Rock

Roll, roll, roll, roll, roll, roll, roll, roll
Rock 'n' roll, roll, roll

Drums, bass, pain, pills, girls
Drink, every weekend, raves
Dances, clubs, ships
That's why they all wanna come backstage
I said that's why they all wanna come backstage, stage, stage


[Chip]
It's munk
Nigga I do this, I do auto no tuning, the lolipop man swag, I start everyone moving
Their careers proved I proved it, feature munk star, I'm a Dan
All I need is 16 bars and I'mma leave with half of your fans
Damn, it's all in the plan, stay with the G's and I don't mean grands
Laxativity when I'm up on the track, so my nigga gonna shit when my album lands
Damn, I'mma roll in the game, I only works with the best in the game
You wanna take me off track you better train


[Kano]
One take one verse, lemme school 'em
Nigga, I'm rock and roll
I'm so fire they drop and roll
Labels phone like "what's the deal"
But it definitely won't be a 3-6-0
I'm too prone, I'm too blown
I'm too rock, I'm too
I don't even finish my flows
'cus before I finish these kids'll clone
I'm Kurt Cobain and I'm straight MJ'ing them
Lapping these boys I'm so Hussain'ing them
Riff running it, from ?? to ?? it's
Mwree mwree while the money's D-doubling
Look I like the template now
You think you're clone don't tempt fate know
That's bad luck like black cats
And we paint the town red like Tampax
It's that time of the month... period


When we hit the town, we paint that red
Standing on tables and kicking down chairs
Cause that's just rock and roll
That's just rock and roll

My credit don't crunch, my swagger's insane
No blue suede shoes
Just my Adidas trainers but I'm still rock and roll
Lord knows I'm rock and roll

Roll, roll, roll, roll, roll, roll, roll, roll
Roll, roll, roll, rock and roll, rock 'n' roll
Roll, roll, roll, roll, roll, roll, roll, roll
Roll, roll, roll, rock 'n' roll, rock 'n' roll
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, ohhhh
