[Verse 1: Chip]
I rhyme rhyme, that's why I shine shine
And you can roll anyone of my shows
No lights in my bag no eye sight
I gotta keep on rhyming man
So I keep on shining man
I ain't gonna be a one hit wonder
I am forever, call me diamond man

[Hook: Emeli Sandé]
I've been talkin' 'bout my new diamond rings
Because my new diamond rings they're the shit
Oh oh oh you've been talkin' 'bout my new diamond rings
Because my new diamond rings
They're what's in
And if you're looking at me
You gon' be looking at them
Cause there the swagger that you see in my walk
And if you're listening to me
You gon' be listening to them
Cause they're the slick that you hear in my talk

[Verse 2: Wiley]
[?]
Got a couple new rings, I'm a don
Anywhere I do a show I've got ladies
Front to the back, sing a long with my songs
19 when I started the dream
Came through, straight away I'm moving along
These days everybody gets so much praise
If you're right, I must be wrong
Oh, Wiley, how do you do?
[?] heard your new tune
You said that you're living it up
All night,, that's good, 'cause I'm doing it too
I've got a house, two cars in the back
And a studio, still got love for my crew
Don't doubt me, [?]
I've got diamonds for me, some for you too

[Hook: Emeli Sandé]
I've been talkin' 'bout my new diamond rings
Because my new diamond rings they're the shit
Oh oh oh you've been talkin' 'bout my new diamond rings
Because my new diamond rings
They're what's in
And if you're looking at me
You gon' be looking at them
Cause there the swagger that you see in my walk
And if you're listening to me
You gon' be listening to them
Cause they're the slick that you hear in my talk

[Verse 3 - Kano]
I ain't saying she's a gold digger
But she knows I ain't broke
Checking my stones, PS1s, woah
She's like a Kano, [?], no
She wants a diamond ring of her own
[?] is a new ringtone
She wants that big big [?}
Blood diamonds from [?}
But I'm shining, [?], creps, leaders, streps, diamonds
I told n**gas I'm gucci though
You won't find these in a shop window
[?], but a few bottles
[?]
With chicks I don't even know yet
And next thing she's wearing my bling

[Hook: Emeli Sandé]
I've been talkin' 'bout my new diamond rings
Because my new diamond rings they're the shit
Oh oh oh you've been talkin' 'bout my new diamond rings
Because my new diamond rings
They're what's in
And if you're looking at me
You gon' be looking at them
Cause there the swagger that you see in my walk
And if you're listening to me
You gon' be listening to them
Cause they're the slick that you hear in my talk
