[Intro: Chip]
Hustle Gang
London Boy in the building
Oh shit, by the way, UK
Wha ah gwaan

[Verse 1: Chip]
Okay so niggas wanna hate on me, I don't give two fucks
You better mind who you have your kids with
Or your baby momma will get cocked
I like girls who come roll my weed, pour her up, pour her up
Even if I run out of money bet I won't run out of luck
My nigga ride who I grew up in the hood for real
I had dreams bout a house on the hills
There's a couple things that we'd run from
And that is police and bills
Before I fucking die I'm going to sniff up a mil
I do it for the pussy & the money & the thrill
My nigga it's fuck you & your opinion too
If your name is not on my will

[Hook: Chip]
I don't give two fucks, I don't give two fucks
I don't give two fucks, I don't give two fucks

[Verse 2: B.o.B.]
If I'm in the building you know I'm screwed up
Even in a threesome, I don't give two fucks
Got so many bitches I'm gonna need two trucks
I'mma need two trucks, I'mma need a few trucks
Lame ass nigga just fuck my cool up
Lyin' ass ho trynna spread rumors
Men gon lie, a women gon lie
So when you think about it who can you trust
Nobody, nobody
Errbody worry bout the old bobby
I got two blunts rolled up in each earpiece
I’ll turn your party to a dro party
All about my green like a neo solo artist
I be coming off the top like a tobogan
I say I don't give a fuck
Can't deal with it that's your problem, ho

[Hook]
I don't give two fucks, I don't give two fucks
I don't give two fucks, I don't give two fucks

[Verse 3: T.I.]
Nigga hol' up, I ain't tryna call yo ho up
Pussy probably smell like throw up
Errbody know her for sucking on the dick until it blow up
Pussy hair need a lawnmower, I’ll show a ho the door
I don't give a fuck nigga so what
Matter fact I don't give two fucks
You and that slut with that flappy-ass butt
Fat ho never would get in my truck
She could never get fucked for her it would never stand up
Hanging out with my balls, like "hell nigga naw"
Fuckin suckas now you dealin' wit' some real niggas y'all
I can show you how to get a mil' in the fall
Make it double by the Winter then triple by the Summer
First Benz for yourself, baby mama get a Hummer
Get a crib for your mama, pass the chopper to the gunner
It's a hundred, fuck around if you wanna
Nigga I don’t give a fuck

[Hook]
I don't give two fucks, I don't give two fucks
I don't give two fucks, I don't give two fucks

[Verse 4: Trae tha Truth]
Trae-tha-Truth Gates, young nigga rich
Who the fuck you niggas think you're talking to bitch
Middle fingers up play it safe, eat dick
Never gave a fuck and prolly still don’t bitch
Run up in the field when I gun I move around
Balled on a hater, you ain't see me shoot around
Never walk up out the club til money cover the ground
All gold chains they weigh about ten pounds
Tryna find a slut that fucks for ten rounds
I tell her go long get ready for ten downs
Mention my name it rang in all towns
King of turf my throne is all brown
Hustle gang bitch, my hustle is out of order
When I'm done with that I get back in somebody daughter
I dont fuck wit niggas, my temper done got shorter
I’ll WorldStar they ass and play them like a recorder

[Hook]
I don't give two fucks, I don't give two fucks
I don't give two fucks, I don't give two fucks

[Verse 5: Young Dro]
Benz and the Cadillac, no top (Mmm-kay)
Chevy geeked up, eat em' up (Mmm-kay)
These ain’t 'gators, these crocs (Okay)
These ain’t diamonds, these rocks (Okay)
Cutlass, Butlass, we the camp
4G’s right under this Lam'
Tell a bitch I don’t give two fucks
Matter fact bitch I don’t give a damn
I’m the shit with a rifle, lose meat like Lipo
I text that bitch, she could suck my di- (shhh!) typo
I meant she could suck my dick, my truck so sick
I’m 'bout to call Wayne up, tell that nigga truk my fit
Ho know where I’m at like Low-Jack, yo' camp I blow back
I don’t give two fucks, but they already know that
I’m cool like winter freeze (Brrr!) in London where Chip be
I was so fresh in the booty club thursday, them hoes tried to tip me

[Hook]
I don't give two fucks, I don't give two fucks
I don't give two fucks, I don't give two fucks

[Verse 6: Travi$ Scott]
If I had two dicks, I wouldn't give two fucks
Last week in Magic City, spending In God We Trusts
2 sphinxes on my chain, who the hell King Tut?
Since the world made me, now the whole globe blessed up
Oh, you wanna fuck me? You need at least two butts
Yeah, you wanna smoke with me? You need at least ten blunts
Uh, I ain't touchin that cup, 'less a motherfucker screwed up
Uh, and I'm young & I'm gettin' it, and I never gave two fucks

[Hook]
I don't give two fucks, I don't give two fucks
I don't give two fucks, I don't give two fucks
