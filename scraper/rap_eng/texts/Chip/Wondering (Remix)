[Verse 1: Geko]
What you wondering for yeah
Don't think too much
You know what wondering ’cause, it brings anxiety to you
And that's when you start frightening me
Baby, you are mine fo' true
Don’t think about saying bye to it
If you busy girl, you'd do the same
You the image in my picture frame
And there's no one else to blame
But baby you my main and I know
You telling me you want sometimes
Steaks with peppercorns sauce and wine
Me might go through war sometimes but it's mad
When our love combines

[Pre-Chorus: Annie & Geko]
You say I'm on your mind (I say you're on my mind)
How come you don't make time, aah ah ah
You say I'm on your mind
But lately you showing me signs, aah ah ah

[Chorus: All (Annie & Chanal)]
Wondering, wondering
Been wondering, wondering where you go
Wondering, wondering
Been wondering, wondering where you
Been here like a million times
Right now, you’re on a decline
Wondering, wondering
Been wondering, wondering where you go
(Where you go)
Wondering, wondering where you

[Verse 2: Ms Banks]
Wondering, wondering
Wondering, wondering where you go
Pondering, pondering
Pondering, pondering, take it slow
Tell me how you feel
’Cause you acting up and I don't really know the deal
Kid got skills and I always keep it real
Every nigga in the hood wanna cop a feel, anyway
Played my part, I’ve been on it from the start
You played with my heart, thinking I should leave you in the past
But it don't last, everytime I pull up quick fast
Feels good, no park, I'ma put you on blast
Bringing out a side you don't wanna see
I’d give it F, but I'm on E, keeping it G
Sleeping on me, ain't nobody love you better than me
Must be seeing someone else 'cause you ain't checking for me

[Chorus: All (Annie & Chanal) [Nadine]]
Wondering, wondering
Been wondering, wondering where you go
Wondering, wondering
Been wondering, wondering where you
Been here like a million times
Right now, you're on a decline
Wondering, wondering
Been wondering, wondering where you go
Wondering, wondering where you
Wondering, wondering where you

[Bridge: Chanal & Annie]
I don't want no karma
So I'ma treat you proper
I don't want no drama
So I'ma treat you proper
I don't want no karma
So I'ma treat you proper
I don't want no drama
But lately you showing me signs ah

[Chorus: All]
Wondering, wondering
Been wondering, wondering where you go
Wondering, wondering
Been wondering, wondering where you
Been here like a million times
Right now, you're on a decline
Wondering, wondering
Been wondering, wondering where you go
Wondering, wondering where you
Wondering, wondering where you
