[Verse 1: Wretch 32]
Look, I never fail to turn up my weakness, I supply teachers
A musical genius, I should write speeches
Father forgive me, I sin with the women
I'm a prince with the vision but a king with the written
If the world don't end when I drop my verse
I'll check myself in and play doctor, nurse
I married beat, that's a rap with urb- my family, I adopted words
So there ain't no quitter in me, I'mma bring home the bags while I'm living in T, yeah
I take sugars but nothing made sweet, just a living nightmare or another strange dream
Yeah, that's always about doing it
My chicks there and always I now doing it
So till the day that I live in the sky
I'll make sure that I'm living on sky (televised)

[Hook: Chip]
There ain't no liar in me, just fire in me
I don't know how to quit, blame the trier in me
And I've been spitting fire on beats and only now your noticing me?
Naaah, this ain't make belief, I'mma make you believe
Opening the doors so that everyone can see- Chyeah
Anytime that me and Wretch are on the beat
Armageddon

[Chipmunk]
Apply the class that I travel on the plane to my lifestyle
Business first, the jet's my speed
Compete with whom, my names my league
Right now I'm tryna win against me, so? I don't mind defeat
I get it on when its crunch time, I let the beat punch and then punch line
Let the single pop when it's chart time
A bag of success, bullets loaded
And next year I'mma matrix reload it
Let the critics all tell me who the one is
Not even that I care who's the best
If I never done well you might have never heard the rest
Might duppy a song with missiorettes
I might hop on stage with JLS
Like who's gonna send for me next
Straight cash come in, I take cheque

[Hook]

[Bridge: Thomas Lumpkin]
Bring out the guns, make sure you're ready for what's going down
Bring down the storm, bring down the rain, get underneath them, bring down the pain
It doesn't matter, night or day I will love in every way
It's just the fire in me yeah yeah
And there ain't no liar in me

[Hook]
