[Intro: Chip]
You see my life is like a film
Beginning, middle... we ain't got to the end yet
Grab your popcorn, your Fanta
Whatever the fuck you're drinking, fuck what you think

[Verse: Chip]
My life is like a movie, all you do is sit and watch
You characters, bunch of actors, it's nothing to have you dropped
Pop just like a hit single, I don't play, bro
Hit you with the right hooks, get on radio
From a boy into a man in front of the public
I ain't tryna hear about you writers, you ain't published
You looking for a deal, you looking for a deal, huh?
I'm looking for the real, I'm looking for the real, huh?
Yeah, new year, new swag
Spend that old money on new things, yeah, I'm the man
Fuck, I remember when I never had a grand
I met the devil, I refused to shake his hand
I met with God, my nigga showed me the plan
He told me "even in defeat, you'll hold your chest up like a man"
"And if you wanna get tatted, my nigga, do that"
"Sky's the limit, little nigga, where your roof at?"
I'm tryna make hope, you're tryna make dough
I've got that great flow, you borrow Drake's flow
Give me the ball, I'll never drop it
World in my palm, Queen's head up in my pocket
My life is like a movie and the film's fucking sick
Table full of lighties, everybody take your pick
Ayo Gav, take your pick
Fuck off, we in this fucking bitch
I said my life is like a movie, welcome to the premiere
Niggas know I go hard, blood medium rare
Red carpets, black ties, suits, we on the road
You little fuckboys probably never heard of Savile Row
I triple dare you have a go
I triple dare you, triple dare you, triple dare you have a go
Pick a career, yeah, that's my dinner
Think I can't rap, I'll tortilla a nigga
Toast to my team, toast to the dream
I don't rate half these niggas but toast to the scene
Toast to the niggas going at me, I love it
Got a reply, I'll probably send it when you're buzzing
What you gonna do me? What you gonna do me?
My niggas pop corn like we in the movies
Used to rate Dixie, now I love Susie
Three-piece for your girl, basically she suits me
This film's fucking cold
Roley all gold, next song's snow
I'm going quiet, got my status kinda pending
But you can't predict my ending
CMAR, team full of dons
Yeah, we on a cruise, 50 carots for the ton
Yeah, we still going strong
9/11, we the bomb

[Hook]
Chilling with my team, here's a toast to the life
Fuck you dudes, I'm going to do whatever I like
Who'd have thought she would do whatever I like?
And it may seem like a movie but it ain't, it's my life
Touchdown this morning, we'll be at it by the night
Girl she's [?] all the birds just wanna fly
She's so beautiful, do whatever I like
And it may seem like a movie but it ain't, it's my life
And it may seem like a movie but it ain't, it's my life, my life, my life
And it may seem like a movie but it ain't, it's my life
My life
And it may seem like a movie but it ain't, it's my life
