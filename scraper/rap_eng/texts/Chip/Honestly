Alright, honestly, honestly (honestly)
These hookers don't bother me (bother me)
Got a rusty spinners and [?] with bells

Man's fuckin' up the music ting
But feds wanna lock me properly (wanna lock me)
My nigga spent racks on his wrist
Just so he can see the time properly (flexin')
Honestly, honestly
These niggas rat for a bit of cheese (snitchin')
My nigga put Luger nines in the MAC
And he crashed that properly (grrah, grrah)
Walk in the club and they clockin' me (clockin' me)
Bare iPhones snapshottin' me (flash)
Ciroc in my cup and I'm faded
Tell bro roll up the broccoli (oi, bill it for me)
I got shooters and we serious
Machinery that's on deck (big ones)
From a dotty to a mock
Man's street-sweepin' in sets (grah)
So we're chartin', got an award
But the feds wanna put it to an end (fuck 'em)
I want big bags of that bread
Gotta give mum slices of bread (money)

[Verse 3: LD]
Beg gemmin' it
Wanna act like you bang for the girls
You're a fraud and a damn shame (gem)
I still lurk, I still serve
I still get harassed by these damn jakes (these pigs)
Approach this G with caution
Know how to stand in a man's face (trust)
But it's calm, we can all be rude (we can do it)
I just smash man up in my Loubs (smash)
Keep thinkin' that you're safe at these shows
And awards 'til my 67 gang intrude (gang)
I make mum so proud (mum)
She used to hate all the things that I do (trust)
She don't even know what I rap about
But it's legally payin' my dues (legally payin' my gang)
I get love from the bluefoots
Cocos, lighties, and Asians too (yeah, all of dat, all of dat)
They're in love with my violent past
And the music too (yeah, all of dat, all of dat)
I get Ps from the boxes I bruk down
And the show life too (aight)
And honestly I'm still in the field
Two Ls with a four four two (let's lurk, gang)

[Chorus: Chip]
You should be honest, G (you should be honest, G)
Honestly, honestly (honestly, honestly)
Admit it, you're onto me (admit it, admit it)
Honestly, honestly (honestly, honestly)
What made you turn on me? (What made you turn on me?)
Honestly, honestly (honestly, honestly)

But now she in front of me (now she in front of me)
