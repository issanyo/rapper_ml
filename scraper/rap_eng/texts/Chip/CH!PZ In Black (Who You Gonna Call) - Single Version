"Attention, attention, calling Chipz, calling Chipz
There's been an ufo sighting on the interstate highway 517."
"Rach-L to controle, I'm ready for a cover-up."

There's something strange knocking on your door
You don't know who to turn to, can't take it anymore
There's something weird right above your roof
You don't know who to call, there's an E. T. On the move

Chipz is back, we are back in black
Making up a story, as we cover any tracks

Who you gonna call when your home alone, who you gonna call tonight?
Who you gonna call in the twilight zone, Chipz is gonna make it right!

Chipz is back
Back in black
Chipz is back!

"The ufo is moving south, I repeat, the ufo is moving south."

There's something strange crawling on the floor
You're running to your neighbours, you can't take it anymore
There's something odd, you feel it in your hair
The ufo is lifting as you look up in the air

Chipz is back, we are back in black
Making up a story as we cover any tracks

Who you gonna call when your home alone, who you gonna call tonight?
Who you gonna call in the twilight zone, Chipz is gonna make it right! (Chipz is back)
Who you gonna call when your home alone, who you gonna call tonight? (Come on)
Who you gonna call in the twilight zone, Chipz is gonna make it right!

"Kevin to our cause, I found the ufo, and I'm preparing to step inside."

We're checking up and down
We're looking all arround
We're going into places where the aliens are found. (2x)

Chipz is back, (Yeah)
We are back in black. (Come on)
Making up a story, as we cover any tracks

Who you gonna call when your home alone, who you gonna call tonight? (Who you gonna call)
Who you gonna call in the twilight zone, Chipz is gonna make it right! (The ufo is neutralized)
Who you gonna call when your home alone, who you gonna call tonight? (We're heading back to base)
Who you gonna call in the twilight zone, Chipz is gonna make it right!

Chipz is back!
