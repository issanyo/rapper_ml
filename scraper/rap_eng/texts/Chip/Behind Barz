[Intro]
Yeah
Link Up TV behind barz, Chip
League of my own II
Out now yeah
27, 'aight boom

[Verse]
Right now I got pushed to the max
I got pushed to a M after tax
I want a few more M's after that
It's bare M's like mm real racks
I touch mic no lies just facts
Disrespect let pen do clap
Niggas mad that I'm coming
For more yeah
Thats tours, awards and plaques
No bars and the fans won't back you
Can't crowd-surf fans won't catch you
Look everyone knows I'm a clean cut guy
But I'll do the dirt if I have to
Like fuck I made pop when I had to
I'll still pen up and pop if I have to
Look if music flopped too bait for a job boy
I'll buy a box if I have to
Cuh there's bricks around me no question
I was bricks in water investin'
I just sold up I'm re-investing
Like how much is that I'm interested
Cuh man are seeing how life can end up
I came through the same time as N-Dubz
See the Cuban flood on my neck bruv?
Cash Motto bands up not bankrupt
But man have been through hell and back
God on my side like where the Devil at?
This music ting's my fuckin' trap
10 years plus still selling raps
Legally free got me poppin' champs
High as fuck in Jamaica flingin' stats
Legal beef it just cost me racks
Grown man ting fuck beef with shanks
You don't hear me akh?
They was like Chip don't diss again
I just shot the catalogue for a quarter M
Somehow I still know the rights of them
I'm like, what can I say I'm so CM
You'll give your music up
For less than that
Got these old niggas looking
Stressed and back
We run tings like the mandem's got it
I see you niggas on labels flopping
Quick twelve independent
Way more than twelve on my pendant
I don't lean on man when I'm not strong
I just cut man off know the pendant
Cash Motto will do what it costs
If man get in the way of this proff
You could be the sickest new
Spitter or GOAT
Still get curried and boxed
Like trust me
Man ain't no vegan
I get blood on my fangs when I'm eatin'
It's late nights doing vamp no sleeping
I'm too smart can take man for eediat
They're like shit man he's big now
He don't wanna clash he's pretending
You know my stance from my
[?] my entrance
MC's chat they chatter just let them
'cause everyone's a sheller 'till
Someones sending
Playing deaf
Piece on the board think you're
Playing chess
You play, boy end up dead
Yeah words are Heff'
The games aren't fair man I'll
Choke the ref
Thats game over yes
I, love seeing young blacks get paid
I was 19 with racks in Abbey National
Trust me, feeling like Santan Dave
In this long before Spotify came
Saviour the rave no spot in my place
Behave before you have me
Plotting my aim
Came in the game it was
All happy days
Things changed, look in my eyes
See pain
See a kid who's been snaked
Kid who put trust in the
Wrong ones
Kid who showed love and got
Turned on
Some man are cold but their
Hearts are tied to the wrong ones
Let them learn in a long run
I pray, for peace I promise
That the same I'm no chief
See me in a dance with my
Dawgs and my P's
Im in a dance with my
Dawgs with a piece
Cah I learnt everytime I put a
Touch in
I swear I wouldn't change
No rushin'
Or even when I got my head bust in
Over jewels and thats nothin'
You fall 7, get up at 8
And learn somethin'
It's weird I know
It's like I'm young but old
See they tried stunt my growth
I'm back on the up
Call me the price of gold
Told Clark make everything rolls
Cash Motto campaigning
Teach you 'bout maintaining
Fake friends and hibernating
I'm in Jamaica I'm
Supposed to be vacating
I'm chillin' billin' fillin' pages
I'm 27 now, I'm sick of fucking hoes
Rather sit in smoke I get levelled out
But I get too high to settle down
Guess I need a gyal on my level now
Not one with the batty out on explore page
Revenge is sweet I could dish out more pain
Before I end up with a wife with whore traits
Birthday beat with a bitch nah fuck that
Told my producer send one I'll lunch that
They try throw me under the bus fam
England knows it gets peak when I come back
I, book flights and go where the sun's at
Melanin in my skin it can't bun fam
Anyone who said they wanna be like man
Should not disrespect me I'mma son that
Fuck the past
Still here with a bunch of bars
Test what man will done your dance
16 I was the first advance
Boy chill, you just got your first advance
I don't force words to sound like words
That's not punch lines that shits absurd
You don't wanna play scrabble just [?]
It was Northside niggas with
The wordplay verse
I'm not a new MC I've been out for years
Turndown money I'm cool I'm nice I'm here
I'm a celebrity get me out of here
Nah I can MC that will get me out of here
Say what I like man, go off the rails
Bun Big Brother my one's still in jail
Imagine me going on there for the P's
Please, that's a whole month no weed
Sushi with Fredo and sincere
I got home sent big bro P for canteen
Wanna put it out there I love my niece
You don't know my life behind the scenes
Think I came up through industry patterns like them
Nah, you don't know nothing 'bout me
First come true it was niggas from T
I feel proud to say I made everything clean
I could squeeze some more but
Thats like a hundred and twenty eight bars
You know I'm gonna be here when I'm
Twenty eight dawg
You ain't on my level I can
Levitate dawg
I will kill a MC speed one take dawg
Cereal with it make a man break-fast
Man get along with a
Handful of spitters in the game
I tell everyone straight look
Me and the rest ain't dawgs but I'm cool
I came for P's not friends I'm no fool
Straight CM over you all
You play the game we make our on rules
No time for you fools listen
Right now in England everything's hot
I know what can make everything stop
So I pray no real drillers see their opps
Right now the scene's on top, yeah

[Outro]
Behind barz, Chip, 27
