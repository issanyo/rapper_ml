[Verse 1: Young Spray]
If you're realer than most, say sho
Young Spray, I rock the stage show
All day, I've got to stay sho
More time, I always say sho
With a pretty girl, that's sho
Face sweet, nice clothes
Nice feet, nice toes
I can't lie, I've got love for the hoes

[Verse 2: Chip]
Two fingers in the air, that's (sho, sho, sho)
Yeah, but you already know
Don't care who you are, let you know
Write that, recite that, let that (blukubyebyebyebyebyebyebye)
Go (blow)
Think you're cold? (Yeah?) Think you're road? (Oi)
You've got a strally and a bally and so
Bluffing, covering your face cuh it's cold (dead)
Still up in the ends, man still see me (sho)
Grime scene saviour, man can't be me (nope)
Bare man hate man but still pree me
Pen up, dead up, man's still easy (rah)
Cash Motto ting, yeah, tun up gang
Peng tings come out and tun up for man (dun know)
If man wanna clap, I'll clap, clap, clap
My pad don't jam

[Verse 3: Stefflon Don]
Music got me living better
Investors stay busy while I itch the palm of my hand
Titties bopping at eleven
She asked if it's real and I told her to go ask her man
Mattie, me mattie, me mattie, me mattie
Ze joggen op die blokken en zetten die pakkies
Je moeder die kookt en noemt het een passie
En zij wilt een foto but she must be mad
Yes, I'm bilingual
I run the 'Dam
Shoutout my brother
He can't come to England cause he's on a ban
I love my mother
Can't say the same 'bout my dad
Every now and then, my sister sends my tunes
And he says "daughter, you're bad"
Rude gyal pon every corner
'Nuff man run a mile just fi get di nana
Steff Don hotter than a sweaty sauna
If I catch a bitch slipping, fam, it's Gaza
Gyal still ah get inna body armour
Dash weh dem body like Mr Palmer
Leave gyal hanging like Tommy [?]
Free Dash, bun fire pon an informer

[Hook: Young Spray]
Money in the bank, that's shower
Paying for the bill, that's sho
Keeping it real, that's shower
Th-that-th-that's shower, th-that-th-that's sho
Money in the bank, that's shower
Paying for the bill, that's sho
Keeping it real, that's shower
Th-that-th-that's shower, th-that-th-that's sho
Sho, sho
Sho, sho
Keeping it real, that's shower
Th-that-th-that's shower, th-that-th-that's sho
Sho, sho
Sho, sho
Keeping it real, that's shower
Th-that-th-that's shower, th-that-th-that's sho

[Verse 4: Frisco]
I'm from North London where the mandem sho
Yeah, you dun know
How much gyal do we get? Tonne-loads
Ain't just out on the road, I run road
Out to my big cuz in the can
Just know that it's totally mad when you touch road
My darg in the background don't say much
But he's got something tucked though, sho
More money in the bank, that's sho
And I make money with the camp, that's sho
You man are stuck like you're wearing a clamp
Dem man are damp, dem man are not sho
I'm old school like turbo bower
Devour your team in an hour, I'm shower
You man are like Alfie in EastEnders
I'm something more like Ghost in Power

[Verse 5: Devlin]
Did someone say sho? Someone say dough?
Give me one sec, no sweat, then I'll rep
Like a bailiff sent, Jimmy came through to collect
Pussyholes owe me rent
So that makes me a pimp, then, I guess
Hearts start sinking in chests
When I come through with the crew full of loons
E-double-S-E-X
Seen the films, my county is Rex
Just like I'm in the club
Sipping on the Bud while I'm sitting with this pretty little slut
[?] cause lyrically, I'm loved
Shallow, it shows, but hey, what the fuck?
I'm just here to have fun
So pass another lager
Turns out I take after my father
I'll drink the bar dry then cry like "where we going after?"

[Bridge: Young Spray & Ghetts]
Fuck the beat up like Ghetto
Fuck the beat up like GH
Fuck the beat up like Ghetto

[Verse 6: Ghetts]
Who are you rating, who? I said who are you rating? (Who, who?)
That's what I do when you name 'em (rah)
I kill 'em in a verse, two and it's mayhem (woo)
Said you're the best and I ruined the statement
It's GH, nigga, don't ever forget that (nah)
When I was young, I was spraying these spitters
It's ironic how a spray caused a sweat patch (mm)
Likkle man, I can hear where your head's at
Just know I've got a sweet 16 for your headback (bap)
If I squeeze 16, you're a dead man (bap)
Hostile? Well, that's the gospel
John 3:16 when I end man
E13 (yah), E15 (yah)
E16, man, I rep that
Keep up, please (rah-gyah-gyah-gyah)
See, sometimes these 16s are a setback
Murder, m-m-murder
Man a finna might turn into a burner
Man'll kill an unknown MC anyway or
Man'll kill an MC everybody's heard of
If you think your barber fucked your hairline up
Trust me, I've pushed wigs back further
I've been getting money from music ten years straight
Dem cyan't tell me 'bout earner
