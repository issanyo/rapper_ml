[Verse 1: Chip]
Yeah it's alright
I had a mad week stressed out, I'mma get it tonight
Fantasising about brain got someone in mind
But lifes just a race against time
So yeah them groupie girls are a blur cause too much pussy ain't good for the grind
Yeah it's my life
We do our own shit in the day, link up in the night
Put the keys under the mat, I'll be there in five
Ummm, yeah you know its that time
I find myself in her uhh, whenever I get lost in her eyes
Kush for me wine for her
Busy but I make time for her
She lets the friends slide for me, I let anything slide for her
Straight crazy life, cherish the moments I'm away for nights
Clothes off, rollie on so I can take note of the time

[Hook: Chip & Sevyn]
I'mma hit it from the moonlight
To the sunrise
Yeah we both dress well but the clothes fly
And I know I'm gonna see you all the time so tonight I'mma let you slide it's alright
Yeah, never had a nigga go in like me
You ain't never had a girl put it down like me but tonights the night
See you falling out of the sky the possibilities
Do everything in one night as long as I'm with you it's alright, it's alright
Do whatever we like, as long as you're right here with me I know it's alright

[Hook: Chip & Sevyn]
Cause I be on a high when you come, you'll be on a low when I leave
And they say out of sight out of mind but that's not the case when it's you and me
It's alright, it's alright, it's alright, it's alright

[Verse 2: Chip]
We get down in my pad and my shits on lock
I go in like I'm playing darts, you know I aim for the spot
She appreciates when I'm here misses me when I'm gone
She sings along to every gyal but hates until you are gone
In the morning might be gone on a plane, but I'll be straight to you when I'm back
And I'm gonna pump until you get asthma
Yeah you know you got a nigga with gust
Yeah straight crazy life, cherish the moments, cause I'm away for nights
Clothes off, rollie on so I can take note of the time

[Hook: Chip & Sevyn]
I'mma hit it from the moonlight
To the sunrise
Yeah we both dress well but the clothes fly
And I know I'm gonna see you all the time so tonight I'mma let you slide it's alright
Yeah, never had a nigga go in like me
You ain't never had a girl put it down like me but tonights the night
See you falling out of the sky the possibilities
Do everything in one night as long as I'm with you it's alright, it's alright
Do whatever we like, as long as you're right here with me I know it's alright

[Hook: Chip & Sevyn]
Cause I be on a high when you come, you'll be on a low when I leave
And they say out of sight out of mind but that's not the case when it's you and me
It's alright, it's alright, it's alright, it's alright

[Bridge: Sevyn]
I want you
Give me your love energy
If only for one second more
Baby it's alright, I said it's alright with me

[Hook: Sevyn]
Falling out of the sky, the possibilities
Do everything in one night as long as I'm with you it's alright, it's alright
Do whatever we like, as long as you're right here with me I know it's alright

[Hook: Chip & Sevyn]
Cause I be on a high when you come, you'll be on a low when I leave
And they say out of sight out of mind but that's not the case when it's you and me
It's alright, it's alright, it's alright, it's alright
