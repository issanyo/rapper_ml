Oopsy daisy, I hurt you again
Crushed your heart in the palm of my hands
If you walk out baby, I'll understand
'Cause all I'll do is hurt you again

Yeah, and again, and again
Oops, here we go again
We messed up once, I messed up twice
But how many times are we gonna try again?
(I dunno)

Girl it's like round and round we go
Hustle, prefer if you left me alone
'Cause I can't take the pain
And now my heartbeat feels like a A.O.A

I'm a walking disaster
Don't wanna hurt you, that's why you got to go
Destruction like fire
All around you, that's why I got to go, oh

Yeah, see the fussin' and fightin', lets not
(Know it)
Before I see red, lets stop
(Trust)
If this here's really the end of
I'mma find cupid and put him in a headlock
(No lie)

Now why did you pick on me?
(Why?)
And why let the pretty bird shit on me?
I don't need good luck, but I need good love
That's a girl that will stand by me
(Many can)

And look honey, I didn't diss you
Therefore, I shouldn't have to miss you
And now I feel like Saturdays all week are
Me and my heart got crazy issues

My girl, it's like round and round we go
Hustle, prefer if you left me alone
'Cause I can't take the pain
And now my heartbeat feels like a A.O.A

Oopsy daisy, I hurt you again
Crushed your heart in the palm of my hands
If you walk out baby, I'll understand
'Cause all I'll do is hurt you again

I'm a walking disaster
Don't wanna hurt you, that's why you got to go
Destruction like fire
All around you, that's why I got to go, oh

Yeah, they say, "Three times a lady"
I say, "Three times, you're crazy"
(Right)
Too dumb, with the messin around
Baseball, love, three strikes you're out
You're too busy trying to catch me out
(Here we go)
But I just wanna get a home run
Can't talk, real after a while gets boring
I need to come back to your touch
(No lie)

Look, it's all too much
I guess now we gotta let go
You seen me grow from a boy to a man
So this must really be the end of the road
(It's gotta be)

And girl it's like round and round we go
Hustle, prefer if you left me alone
'Cause I can't take the pain
And now my heartbeat feels like a A.O.A

I'm a walking disaster
Don't wanna hurt you, that's why you got to go
Destruction like fire
All around you, that's why I got to go, oh

Oopsy daisy, I hurt you again
Crushed your heart in the palm of my hands
If you walk out baby, I'll understand
'Cause all I'll do is hurt you again
