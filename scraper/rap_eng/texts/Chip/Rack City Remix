Fuck tru religion catch me in some cheap jeans
Power to the people but my favourite colour green
Arsenal and tottenham its all the same to me
Cos my n***** from spurs are the gunners in my team
Birds tweet chatting shit and never follow up
Fuck them I got more cash than followers
My teams tight I don’t need new friends g
But me and that block button getting friendly
In the club gimmie space fam
You know them white girls love me like fake tan
Yea I’m a made man
Look at what I made man
Team UK I’m a household name fam
Please Lord forgive my sins
Yea I over think and over drink
In the club me I might order Magnums
But my gangster friends might bring one in
Ah yeah we in this bitch n****
You just bitch n****
Cos u a bitch n****
Fuck these MC’s and their punchlines
I got bars like girls I just dump mine
Anytime on any beat I choose
And I bet I can beat any beat I choose
Don’t make me pick your chick cos my point to prove
Pussy I can have u dropped if I point at you

Killer Hip Hop UK
I’m on this TOWIE ting fam its no joke
Tryna swap the second P with a K in Lauren Pope
Never drown in pussy me I stay afloat
Play Noahs ark till I sink ya boat
Ya still living with ya mum you ain't a big man
I never hear you and ya team do it big fam
Play false hair and get one up in your wig fam
Were all inked up but you got shit tatts
And the hot girls know what I’m on
Doggy till ya bottom goes red
Louboutin
You might even get a pair if you cook good
I tell a model it ain't enough to look good
Dead wrong thinking my games up
MC’s paying for views the games fucked
For running up ya beak have you duck taped up
Middle finger up in ya chick who gives a fuck
Say it how it is I don’t give two shits
I’m on this Caribbean tip but shout out the Brits
I use your album cover just to out my spliffs
And I go inside out if them man go in
Yea!
