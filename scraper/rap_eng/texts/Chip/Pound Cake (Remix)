[Intro: Jimmy Smith]
Good God Almighty. Like back in the old days. You know, years ago they had the A&R men to tell you what to play, how to play it and you know whether it's disco and rock but we just went in the studio and we did it. We had the champagne in the studio, of course, compliments of the company, and we just laid back and did it. So we hope you enjoy listening to this album half as much as we enjoyed playing it for you. Because we had a ball. Only real music is gonna last, all the other bullshit is here today and gone tomorrow...

[Intro: Chip]
Yeah
Oi pass the lighter
Just one of them weeks where
If I don't write it down I go mad

[Verse]
Uhh
Who says the lines that make these rappers cry
It has to be Chip
I wrote this shit when I was Flu'd up
It has to be sick
Shit my God-brother's mum died
He's inside
Knowing I knew before him it brought a tear to my eye
He called my up the next day like
J my mum's dead
I never got to tell her why, say sorry, explain why
See when death's around the corner you don't see it coming
Crying he hanged up
Shit the gov's coming
It's got me thinking bout my life and what's what nigga
Like I'll make pop before I'll shot nigga
Imagine if your mum died and you was in a box
Even in them 4 wall's you'll be fucking lost
I'm zoned out put the lemon in the spliff
I been killin' shit from 06
And Wiley told me evolve or be extinct
So why these niggers still flowing like they stuck in 06
You hitting stand stills my nigga well I ain't to blame
So when your tweeting, beg you don't at my name
Me I'm off the rails, I will stop your train
I'm Ali with it, don't punch above your weight
I'm putting words together I'm kinda gifted
Get a diss track gift wrapped for Chirstmas
Couple set backs but I'm still on the ball
Your praying on my downfall, well god missed that call
Yeah, so what we rapping for if it's not the cake
My birthday I want more candles on the cake
Just so I can make a wish for more cake
Cake, cake cake cake cake
Age 14 was paper round cake
17 I kinda found cake
You can't gas me I been around cake
The squares are out of my circle let's get this round cake
Wait, 2014 new cake
Like the kid in Matilda I ran through cake
I've had Rita cake
I want Rhianna cake
I got you thinking what kinda ... cake
I know niggers gang banging bandanna cake
A grade student I get the grammar cake
Any genre I'm coming for all kinda cake
Yeah, woo

[Outro]
