[Intro]
So what are man gonna do when they gotta stop chatting bout me? Man like Chipmunk, you know, yo

[Verse]
Right now if you look around
There ain't much light without me
I'm the sun, you're the moon
You cannot shine without me
Too many man wanna link up
Just to go against my pen
North London stand up
I still rep my ends
Sick MCs come from Tottenham
Real badman come from Tottenham
Went school and college in Tottenham
See a lot of bloodbaths in Tottenham
But I want big tings for Tottenham
Bun that, want big tings for London
Bun that, want big tings for England
But bad mind people, bun them
I don't wanna hear no more problems
Quick time put an end to the nonsense
Man called me out, I came back, they came back
But they came back chatting nonsense
Man are sitting down chatting nonsense
Whole diss tracks full of nonsense
I'mma hit you with the facts, no nonsense
In the crib with my plaques, no nonsense
No airtime off me, I ain't saying no names
Cuh I pree that you man are all 'bout nonsense
Hundred bags worth of jewels that I don't wear
Cause I'm no longer gassed off nonsense
Back back, good over evil
Still outchea with my people
Don't say what you heard and don't say who said it
Come on now, stick to your G code
But let me put an end to your rumours, dead
I don't owe nobody nuttin', dead
Never paid Chris Brown nuttin', dead
Swear on my granddad's grave, he's dead
Man know they can't test me on the mic
So they wanna try switch the vibe instead
I said I am the grime scene saviour
Real talk, manaman are back from the dead but
'Wunsumlysumdemsun, dead
I only asked where you are, dead
Pepper Riddim, three minutes, five man
If you can't do the maths, dead
This ain't between no ends, dead
It's just me and my pen, dead
I've got shit to do, tunes to drop
Cheques to cut #ImStillAliveNotDead
Hating, you wish I was dead
Sorry, I can't run out of bars
You barked up the wrong tree, now I'm fuming
Got more fire for you niggas, bars
No one told me when you're 10 years deep
That man will build their career off your past
We'll see who's still here in 10 years, darg
Do your ting, I'll do mine, I'm calm
Me no tek intimidation
I oversee mind games and stay calm
My verse is like a scripture a psalm
Shout out my brothers who read the Qur'an
Superstars might sing hooks for me
While you man sing my hooks for me
You're just doing what I've done, it's all good to me
It's big tings to you, it's riff raff to me
It's some chatty patty chit-chat to me
To anyone putting my voice on iTunes
No consent, get a legal team
My team's tight, don't play with me
Chipmunk, conscience kid with a conscience
Seize up still, miss me with the nonsense
My problem started out with my man
2 2s, I'm getting teams from the conference
Now look at my face, am I bothered?
From now I'mma Kermit the Frog it
So what?
Man dem spread rumours like gyal dem, them type of man dem, I don't understand them
It's some chatty patty chit-chat to me
To anyone putting my voice on iTunes
No consent, get a legal team
My team's tight, don't play with me
Chipmunk, conscience kid with a conscience
Seize up still, miss me with the nonsense
My problem started out with my man
2 2s, I'm getting teams from the conference
Now look at my face, am I bothered?
From now I'mma Kermit the Frog it
Pretty boy, couple pop tunes
But I can still pen up and pop it
Me VS one man? Nah, that's crazy
3, 4, 5, 6 man can't take me
Nobody's phoned me, everyone's snaky
By now I don't give a fuck if you rate me, I'm out

[Outro]
Believe & Achieve, yeah?
EPisode 1
Trust me
I ain't even got nothing more to say, anyone that thinks they're gonna be chatting to me from here, understand you're gonna be chatting to yourself, rudeboy
Get me? CM
