[Verse 1: Chip]
I put my life in my words, then I put my words in my life
Sacrificing my arm, I guess inks part of my life
Even if I don't write and I do it all in my mind
I never saw none of this coming
And now its right before my eyes
Close, I'ma keep 'em open
Think too long and miss the moment
I was told you might get one shot
I said even if its blank I'ma pop, yeah
And now I run the show
I got the plaque but everything isn't gold
My nicknames a hot topic on the road
But truthfully i just wanna know
Yeah

[Chorus: Chip]
The day i pass away
Will you let my name pass away
And jump on to the next craze
Ama carve my name, in them history books
So you can see how history looks
The day i pass away
Will you let my name pass away
And jump on to the next craze
Ama carve my name, in them history books
So you can see how history looks
History looks

(History looks
History looks
History looks)

(Verse 2: Wretch 32)
I gave my life to the game
And never got on Def Jam
Time goes forward but there's setbacks
It's like I took a step forward and lean't back
And watch the scene fly past with there jet packs
But I got love for everyone of them artists
Were in the same race, It's whoever runs smartest
Heh, I never feel like I'm drowning
Music makes me fly and my friends keep me grounded
Shh, only the best I'm surrounded
We're all on board
Like chess to a crown king, heh
Were all aiming for the top
The best albums, the outcome. we all gotta drop
Yeah, but we ain't all gonna flop
If united we stand in our Benetton and tops
The sediment rocks
We'll be here forever
Legends don't die, they get remembered

[Chorus: Chip]
The day I pass away
Will you let my name pass away
And jump on to the next craze
Ama carve my name, in them history books
So you can see how history looks
The day I pass away (*yeah*)
Will you let my name pass away
And jump on to the next craze
Ama carve my name, in them history books
So you can see how history looks
The day I pass away (*yeah*)
Will you let my name pass away
And jump on to the next craze
Ama carve my name, in them history books
So you can see how history looks
The day I pass away
Will you let my name pass away
And jump on to the next craze
Ama carve my name, in them history books
