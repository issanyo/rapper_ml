I am just a poor girl, madam, poor girl

I am just a guy, see, buy, you enjoy

I need a girl like a tonic needs gin
I need a girl got me down in my sins
Seems even far but it doesn't to me
Since I'm a lonely dedicating the streets

Well, you name it, I'll do it
Anything you want me to do, I'll do it
You name it, I'll do it
Anything you want me to (Anything you want me to)
Anything you want me to do (Well, I do it for you)

Where's my generation, please, be patient

I believe in liberty, whisky, democracy

I need a girl like a tonic needs gin
I need a girl got me down in my sins
Seems even far but it doesn't to me
Since I'm a lonely dedicating the streets

Well, you name it, I'll do it
Anything you want me to do, I'll do it
You name it, I'll do it
(Anything you want me to) (Anything you want me to)
(Anything you want me to do) Well, I do it for you

You name it, I'll do it
Anything you want me to do, I'll do it
You name it, I'll do it
Anything you want me to (Anything you want me to)
Anything you want me to do (Well, I do it for you)
