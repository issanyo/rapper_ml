[Intro]
Yeah
Yeah
Whats he gunna say?

[Verse 1]
You wanna be like me son get a change of plan
I don't hardly see my dawgs, get a hand, pick ma fam
Confused, feelin used, tryin to rearrange plans
Coz I've got a rolex but no time on my hands
Made a transition from a boy into a man
Step one never mix ya business and fam
Haters say I changed but I can't disagree
Coz the figures damn skippy ain't the same in the bank
And I just wanna say thanks
To those tryin to pull me down
I was born to be fly I don't like the ground, so don't tell me stay grounded
I'm good in my town
And when I was blue you just weren't around
I shouldn't know stress at my age
Money came around me then everybody changed
Fools say they know me from day dawg, stop tryin to call me by my government name
Cor its all chipmunk now
You can blow after
It's chipmunk now, it's chipmunks time
Chipmunk's in his prime
And only Chipmunk can take Chipmunk's shine

[Hook]
I made a transition
I made a transition
You can say I made a transition

[Verse 2]
I'm feelin like I found myself but lost my mind
They wanna take my life, I take my time
I'm haere and flesh but lost my life my privacy went up in the sky
When I signed I
Got to six figures then I grin teeth, airing all the tag alongs like bring me
I never breaded no one when I was working
So hate me if you want but don't say I don't deserve it
Understand the position I played then
Understand the transition I made then, go and picture me back in the days then
Look at me now and get mad
They just wanna get fly, I've been there I'm jet lagged
Now everybody step back
I'm on the next ting, its not a bless ting
They're number two, I'm on some next shit
First place that's the first base, suicide that's the worst case
Spend your whole life time is tryin to get your dough up
And then you blow up and blow up
No escalators, stairs, and I'm still tryin to step up
Butter fingers tryin to handle the pressure
I can't let the game slip away
When the UK routes for my name
Shame
Its all Mr. Munk now
You can blow after
It's Mr. Munk now
It's Mr. Munks time
Mr. Munk's in his prime
And only Mr. Munk can take Mr. Munk's shine!

[Hook]
I made a transition
I made a transition
You can say I made a transition

[Verse 3]
Being succesful, that's a gift and a curse
Being paid or being broke I know whats' worse
And people at the bottom say that
You forgot you're roots but that's always the case when you rise from the dirt
And preparation is the key to elevation
But them man are too busy hating, debating
If I sound better on some grime shit
Half of them don't even know what grime is
It's all timing, even though I blew quicker than your average
I came through slicker than you're average
Coz yeah I'm not you're average spitter
Any tempo or instrumental the Flows mental
Straight jacket worthy, conspiracy, they plotting merk me
If I'm the fire, how could you burn me?
I'm so in, how could you out me?
I'm so true, how could you doubt me?
Allow me
Cor its all me now
You can blow after
It's all me now
It's all me time
It's all me in my prime
And only I can take my shine!

Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
You can say I made a transition
