{Hook: Neutrino]
Super rich, Avirex
Girls see this, get wet
Occupation, Mic Check
Yeah, occupation MC Mic Check
Girls come up to we
Talking crazy cos their horny
Wanting sauce in their panties


Chip:
Was a young boy then
Man a big man now
See Garage and Grime, that's a big man sounds
What, you old school then
I'll take it old school now
Pon de mic ?
I'll lick man down
Chip's got gears
Chip's got rounds
Chip's got levels
Don't look down
You think your dizzy
You're probably right
Spin this weight
Get spun back round
I be like fuck them youts its long
I was on sets when Neuts was blonde
Fek had to holla for the Avirex song
14, Ally Pally with my Avirex on
Sing along like
I was on the ends, never had a kilo
Work for my p tho, ........
Bookey yeah that's how the streets go
Man are on me and off key Moschino
Like wow, why so rude
Been a bad week, not in the mood
I need a drink, I need a zoot
You off key niggas need OO2
I just need vocals, decks and a mixer
I don't like niggas cuh, man are too mixup
Mouth too rage man, got no filter
Booth and snap then
Man jus insta
I got too much on my mind when I'm barring
Fuck that bitch and baby, that's jarring
Avirex's to Stoney's I've lasted
Told Fek leave the verse and I'll blast it
