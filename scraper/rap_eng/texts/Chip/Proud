[Intro: Wretch 32]
Regardless if we're young, we're still spraying

[Verse 1: Wretch 32]
Growing my hair, getting my power back
On a Samson vibe up from a shower cap
Now I cut my hair 'bout three times a week
Growing up I sat down for half an hour plaits
Them times I wasn't too fussed about the shape-up
Suit wasn't tapered, the roof might be taped up
Nowadays I jump in a coupe, the roof's raised up
Funny how this is a disgrace to how I was raised up
See, I used to watch my mother scrape the pennies
Now my pennies replaced with Fendi
Still a hole in my jeans, but now it's trendy
I used to follow their lead but now I'm trending
Reminiscing on them days Wretchy didn't need P
Playing kiss chase, they didn't wanna kiss me
Funny how success can define greed
When I was on my face, I found it easier to sleep
Â£5.99 for my bag for school
The other day I saw a girl with Louis bag and shoes
As the world spins, we're getting blinded by the wind
We was wearing Wallaby's, now they're wearing Timbs
Used to make my ringtone, now I make my rings
Devil's wearing Prada, yeah, we're paying for our sins
And I ain't even saying Totty's gonna take the league
But as long as I'm throwing up a T, we're gonna win

[Hook: Chip]
I ain't proud to say
I grew around killers
See, my mother never raised me
To be anyone's dinner around here, round here, round here
You can lose your life round here
Ain't too many ways out round here
Around here, around here
Around here

[Verse 2: Young Spray]
One thing about Spray, you know we ain't fronting
And if I had another chance, I wouldn't change nothing
I'd still be on the block with the same something
And if I got a problem, I'd still say something
I miss back in the day, when the game wasn't
Taken so seriously, we just stayed buzzing
Walking home from school, me and my bait cousin
We never had no tool because it weren't that
Give me my innocent years back
Let me begin again, I'll sin again
Still end up on that island just like Gilligan
Asking the lord why they killed my friend
Mummy raised a good boy, the streets raised a bad one
Grew up in the hood, boy, a dad, I never had one
No excuses but I'm mad I never had one
Cause on her own, how could Mummy cope with her bad son?
I'm representing children on an estate
Where your enemy used to be your best mate
Where every day could be your death day
We're just left with what's left, mate
Why's it gotta be this way? I keep asking
Why's it's gotta be this way?
I don't wanna feel this pain
I need answers, I don't wanna feel this rain

[Hook: Chip]
I ain't proud to say
I grew around killers
See, my mother never raised me
To be anyone's dinner around here, round here, round here
You can lose your life round here
Ain't too many ways out round here
Around here, around here
Around here

[Outro: Chip]
I grew around killers
I grew around killers
