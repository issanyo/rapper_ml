[Verse 1: Chip]
Listen, I heard through the grapevine
You can really wine up your waistline
No Wi-Fi, give me FaceTime
Reverse the ting now and take time
Why don't you tek off and leave him
And tek off your G string to these strings
Morning time, night time or evening
Gyal, you got that someting I'm needing

[Chorus: Kranium]
She say she wan' fuck in a car, my style dat
Trust me ah my style dat
She say she wan dweet pon di beach in a sea
You likkle freak but ah my style dat
She say she wan' ride all night
So me tell her say yes ah your style dat
But if ya wan video every time me ah beat
Me nuh dweet, cause a nuh my style dat

[Verse 2: Kranium]
You are di best, take off ya dress
Cover me, kiss up your neck and get your body caressed, oh yeah

[Verse 3: Chip]
Kiss on yuh chest, take 'way ya breath
Come mek we bill up an uh while you give me neck
Got your hips on mine, mek the stiff something rise
So she say "Mr Wolf, what's the time?"

[Chorus: Kranium]
She say she wan' fuck in a car, my style dat

She say she wan dweet pon di beach in a sea
You likkle freak but ah my style dat
She say she wan' ride all night
So me tell her say yes ah your style dat

[Chorus: Kranium]
She say she wan' fuck in a car, my style dat

She say she wan dweet pon di beach in a sea
You likkle freak but ah my style dat
She say she wan' ride all night
So me tell her say yes ah your style dat
But if ya wan video every time me ah beat
