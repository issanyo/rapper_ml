[Intro: Chip & Dappy]
N-Dubz, Chipmunk
Ay, listen to I innit

[Verse 1: Dappy]
You believe, you believe, you believe, you're a G
Cause you went to the park with your friends and let a shot off in the sky
I'm a G cause if I go to the showroom
I don't have to ask for no discount for whatever I'm gonna buy
Chuck in the door
Tell him I'mma see him in the nearby future
When I want another ride
Got the whole country shoutin' na na naii
Just because you got one tune on the screen
Why you goin' round west with shades on your face
Fake chain on your neck posin' to be seen
You should get rush
I did 280 shows last year
I bagged seven bills every show, that's rare
Imagine how my bank will look next year
I believe, I believe

[Hook: Dappy]
I will defeat you
Should never mention me
If he comes on top and I ring a man
His reply will be like, don't worry I will be there ASAP
I will eat you
Don't wanna fuck with me
Don't get on the wrong side of me
I'm givin' you to the count of 3, 2, 1

[Verse 2: Chip]
Yo, you believe, you believe
You can mention me like I haven't opened doors
I'm the reason, DJ's pay these kids
I'm done supportin' the cause
Hold up pause, how could you mention the best?
You ain't never seen no royalty checks
You will never go to places I went
Dawg, I'm moving up PRS
These kids better done with the indirects
Naw, you don't wanna see, I vex, I'm a lord to the mic
I hear you pray for my end, you can get stuffed
I got a bad boy album ready for the stores
MySpace views that'll will piss on yours
A face that the ladies like of course
I believe, I believe

[Hook: Dappy]
I will defeat you
Should never mention me
If he comes on top and I ring a man
His reply will be like, don't worry I will be there ASAP
I will eat you
Don't wanna fuck with me
Don't get on the wrong side of me
I'm givin' you to the count of 3, 2, 1

[Verse 3: Fazer]
I remember the days we were poor
When five men would chip in for a 10 draw
That's 2 pounds each when days were so raw
Now we're tourin' abroad and achievin' awards
So if somebody was to take my freedom away
I would hate that
Therefore if I got any kind of problem
All I'd have to do is ring my guy and he'll deal with it ASAP

[Verse 4: Tulisa]
When girls see me there like, ain't that the ha ha, girl?
You givin' me a screw face and I, I'll show you what ha ha means
I'm not a trouble maker, but if you bring it to me I will break ya
I'm a real chick and not a bitch, young with a dream, I'm tryin' get rich

[Hook: Dappy]
I will defeat you
Should never mention me
If he comes on top and I ring a man
His reply will be like, don't worry I will be there ASAP
I will eat you
Don't wanna fuck with me
Don't get on the wrong side of me
I'm givin' you to the count of 3, 2, 1
I will defeat you
Should never mention me
If he comes on top and I ring a man
His reply will be like, don't worry I will be there ASAP
I will eat you
Don't wanna fuck with me
Everyone I roll with is trustworthy
I'm givin' you to the count of 3, 2, 1

[Outro: Dappy]
Yo, 2008 or should I say great?
Cause it's N-Dubz and Chippy on the feature
Na na frickin' naii, you say
Gas innit
