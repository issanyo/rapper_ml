[Hook: Keri Hilson]
In the air, in the air
Put your lights up in the air
In this moment, come together
Be as one without a care

[In the air, in the air
Put your lights up in the air
In this moment, come together
Be as one without a care]

[Verse 1: Chipmunk]
Yeah, what is everybody afraid of me for?
See the age I came through I weathered the storm
I'm playing with thunder and firing cells
They making it rain, safe
We making it hell
You wanna visit fire
I throw you to hell
They can't see me
But they feel me, I'm basically braille
You're looking at the Holy grail and this is what I wanna make
I don't care if it sells

[Bridge: Keri Hilson w/Chipmunk]
Put the lighters up (go on put ‘em in the air)
Put the lighters up (everybody, everywhere)
Put the lighters up (high, where I can see)
Put the lighters up (so, you can shine like me)

[Hook]Keri Hilson
[In the air, in the air
Put your lights up in the air
In this moment, come together
Be as one without a care]

[Hook]Keri Hilson
[In the air, in the air
Put your lights up in the air

[Verse 2: Chipmunk]
Why you, why you, why you actin' like you ain't heard of me
This is sick to you, this a verse to me
And everybody's gettin' deals now
Cause every frickin' label wants one of me
Yeah, you can’t replicate my style
I’m on my high horse, no Ralph
And you're looking at the Holy grail and this is what I wanna make
I don't care if it sells

[Bridge: Keri Hilson w/Chipmunk]
[Put the lighters up (go on put ‘em in the air)
Put the lighters up (everybody, everywhere)
Put the lighters up (high, where I can see)
Put the lighters up (so, you can shine like me)]

[Hook: Keri Hilson]
[In the air, in the air
Put your lights up in the air
In this moment, come together
Be as one without a care]

[Hook: Keri Hilson]
[In the air, in the air
Put your lights up in the air
In this moment, come together
Be as one without a care]

[Verse 3: Chipmunk]
This is straight up, you can't F with me music
Never chose it, it's destiny music
This ain't other music, this is confidence crusher music
There ain't too many that I'm cool with
I'm just tryna' take it, but no-one has took it
Yes I am a novelty, hence all the bookings
Never touched the drop, but they smell what I'm cooking
I did it without looking whilst you can’t get a look in

[Bridge: Keri Hilson w/Chipmunk]
[Put the lighters up (go on put ‘em in the air)
Put the lighters up (everybody, everywhere)
Put the lighters up (high, where I can see)
Put the lighters up (so, you can shine like me)]
