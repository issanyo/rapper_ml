[Intro: Tinchy]
Cloud 9, Munk
We're wishing them the best
We're wishing them the best

[Verse 1: Tinchy]
This is catch two-two, I'm age two-two
Spent like two-two on a blackout coupe
Wanna know how I'm looking lately
Don't stare through limousine tints, that's rude
I break necks, I'm a real head-turner
And back then I was a first time learner
I skipped classes, straight to the masters
Now look, I'm a skyline earner
Cash in hand, no finance
When we cash in grands, it's violent
Chipmunk co-pilots the airlines
So flee, we land on next islands
I topped the bill, we can't relate cause you earn the bill
Â£100, there's chrome on the grills
No less than 19s on the wheels
Back to the music, wheel this
I flow crazy, mental illness
Brainless, but I'm amazing grace so thy shall feel this
I'm raising the bar, your waistline
I liaise with stars on cloud nine
Wings on my back, skydive
It's over, wrap, night time

[Hook: Tinchy]
Trust, no stress, we're calm
We're shooting far, we got dem
Trust, we glow in the dark
We're some superstars, we got dem
Trust, no stress, we're calm
We're shooting far, we got dem
Trust, we glow in the dark
We're some superstars, they wanna know
How we sounding lately
Tell me how we're sounding lately
We're down, we're moving
So we keep it moving
How we looking lately?
Tell me how we're looking lately
The grams, we're moving
Flee, keep it moving

[Verse 2: Chip]
I'm the cream of the crop
Flee but I ain't all over the dog
My collar I pop, I'm heavy on pop
I'm heavy on grime, I'm heavy on rock (anyting)
And the garments speak for themselves
Your outfit cost the same as my belt
Five bills, so don't question me about wealth
You get a pair, I get the shelf
And that was before the deal
Assassinate versus born to kill
Colder than Neptunes, so Pharrell
I mean for real, you know the deal
You know the drill, yeah G, I nail it
I talk money, more so, I make it
And Tinchy don't boast too much
But his stack is not what his name is

[Verse 3: Tinchy]
Munk, it's not what my name is
I've got money coming out of my anus
I set trends, don't follow what the craze is
If they're hood rich, we're Vegas
Lifestyle's for the rich and famous
Maybe not rich, but definitely famous
Face on the front page papers
A-list, they trail by acres

[Hook: Tinchy]
Trust, no stress, we're calm
We're shooting far, we got dem
Trust, we glow in the dark
We're some superstars, we got dem
Trust, no stress, we're calm
We're shooting far, we got dem
Trust, we glow in the dark
We're some superstars, they wanna know
How we sounding lately
Tell me how we're sounding lately
We're down, we're moving
So we keep it moving
How we looking lately?
Tell me how we're looking lately
The grams, we're moving
Flee, keep it moving
