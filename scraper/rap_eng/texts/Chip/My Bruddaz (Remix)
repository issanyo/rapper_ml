[Intro]
Way, you see that Cash Motto ting you got right there?
It's wavy (remix)

[Verse 1: Chip]
Yep yep, light show, ya dun know, new ones
One-line flow, quick time flew on
Man have got old friends and new ones
True, I had fake friends and true ones
Look, RIP the real ones we lost this year
North side still got this year
Do you know how long my ends been on?
Man from my ends put other ends on
Gift with the words, man got the gift of the gab
Don't let me give you a verse
Pad called clapping, pencil porn
And I back them out when I'm bored
Like who wants to talk?
No one, that's what I thought
Man can't run out of bars, not when I'm here, though
Man wanna draw me out, that's all air, though
North side, me and my bruddaz still here though

[Hook: Chip]
Pull up in the club with me and my bruddaz
Got this Mac loaded with bangers, all by me and my bruddaz, hey
Buff gyal wanna skank with me and my bruddaz
No one can't tell me nothing, it's just me and my bruddaz, hey

[Verse 2: Jme]
I show love all day, tree-huggers
Breakfast with milk, no udders
What a cheat, test me? Little buggers
Shit creek, no paddle, no rudders
I spit cold bars, cold shudders
Jail crew, bang doors, food pluggers
Broke laws, got caught, street muggers
Any man wanna hate? Suck mothers
Mandem on road, young thuggers
No pain, no gain, Tough Mudders
In hats and hoods, no Uggers
Get rude, black eye, nose blooders
That's right, my goons on crudders
Real friends around me, no others
Family, bredrins, fist spudders
Show, ya dun know, my bruddas

[Hook: Chip]
Pull up in the club with me and my bruddaz
Got this Mac loaded with bangers, all by me and my bruddaz, hey
Buff gyal wanna skank with me and my bruddaz
No one can't tell me nothing, it's just me and my bruddaz, hey

[Verse 3: Lethal Bizzle]
Yo, me and my dons, me and my bruddaz
You don't rate us? You can suck mothers
Real ones only, no others
You man are some thirsty for the fame bruddaz
Man wanna bring him, man wanna be famous
It's not what you think, the gram is outrageous
See me on the TV, see me on the cable
You can't have a seat, you bring nothing to the table
Don been winning here way too long
My brand, yeah, way too strong
Yeah, man's been doing this ting from Craig David
Had pepper grey, them man was singing K2 song, yeah
Me and my bruddaz, yeah, we stay winning
Bare sixes, you man have got no more innings
You wanna be here for ten year plus?
It's my blueprint you need to be preeing, pow

[Hook: Chip]
Pull up in the club with me and my bruddaz
Got this Mac loaded with bangers, all by me and my bruddaz, hey
Buff gyal wanna skank with me and my bruddaz
No one can't tell me nothing, it's just me and my bruddaz, hey
Pull up in the club with me and my bruddaz

Buff gyal wanna skank with me and my bruddaz
