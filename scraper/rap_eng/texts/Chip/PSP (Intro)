Listen, yo, yo

[Verse: Chip]
I got your girl on the bus with my tune, singin', I'm not kiddin'
Before, I was pebblin', now I'm wingin'
I am the best from the 1990s
Who's on the left? [?] I'll sting him
When it comes to the grime, I'm a king and
You're not a king and you will get kick out
I treat the tracks like a lass, you're a gas
I'll strap it, the booth with the fire, then stick it
140BPM, I'm sickin'
Bass with the trouble and the snare and the kick and
Once I get a beat like this from [?]
Leave me so swiftly, the big bar's kickin'
But you'll never [?], get kick out
You likkle small fry, you'll never be biggin'
Once you see me, zone out with a [?]
[?] before I'm [?]
'Cause when I'm [?]
You man are sheep, I'm leadin' a flock
I've been on grime since 003
By 008 with the game, I'll be leggin'
So please don't play with me though
[?]
Wiley done said that playtime's over
Not for me though, I rock with the flow
I rock with the flow and I'll [?] yours
Use it, make it sound better than yours
I can't see one kid on my wavelength
Now I'm on top of this ting, I can pause
I'm a dog with the mic in my paws
On to the grime since 004
And them man's 64 can't test it
My [?] 8s since 004
With my [?] 8s from 004
I'm still bangin' down raves, ask [?]
Take time on a diss, that's still heavy
There ain't no yout man ready
And yeah, I'm in the team for the youts that I heavy
Big up boy Hits is more than ready
Can't forget Shalo, he's back to the muddle
Bang up a boy on the mic, he's heavy
Cuh we goin' on [?]
None of them youts can [?] me again
And I rep for the circular movers
League of my own when I'm ridin' again
So who's gonna try me again?
Criminal's flow but I'm [?] again
Can't chuck a ting cuh I'm comin' in cuh
I'm in the [?] and I'm [?] again, dun know
