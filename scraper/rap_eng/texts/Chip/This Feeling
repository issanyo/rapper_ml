[Hook]
Turn the lights down low
And let the liquor flow
Maintaining this feeling
Freedom is what we are seeking
Oh, so far, so far, so far
Our souls have been stealing
So far, so far, so far
What is this feeling?

[Verse 1: Chip]
I ain't been this high in a minute
I could never hear a fucking hook like this and not kill it
Turn them lights down low, mix that but make it strong
Man, these spliffs ain't working, somebody pass me my bong
Some do rap, some do grime, I'm just doing Chip (me)
Everyday I pray lord, let me do it big
Life's a gamble, I bet Hitler didn't picture this (no)
Turning in his grave as niggas pushing German whips
See me, I'm that north side nigga, you know me
In this concrete jungle, I'm Mowgli
Got a pen in my hand, I'm Shinobi
I just wanna make it out with my homies
Should I say friends cuh I'm really from the ends
Started from a Golf then took it to a Benz
You saw me with Chris Brown walking on water
Skepta came with me cuh we do it for the ends
North side, my nigga (blaow)
And you know what the two letters in hard are
Since "Go Down South", I might go down south
And bar DVS, this one harder
I'm shaked up, going harder
Big up T, my barber
I disappeared, but came back around
With my Cs up, that's for karma, yeah
AR15

[Hook]
Turn the lights down low
And let the liquor flow
Maintaining this feeling
Freedom is what we are seeking
Oh, so far, so far, so far
Our souls have been stealing
So far, so far, so far
What is this feeling?
What is this feeling?
What is this feeling?

[Verse 2: DVS]
It was all a dream, I used to only rap for my team
Now I'm in rap magazines
Saying that I rap supreme, tracks with kings
Getting high in the back of limousines
You can't be too trusting
When life don't mean nothing
It's funeral after funeral
Another funeral, back to bussing
Brixton, home of the brave hearts
Though some man ain't ours
Drop-top whips, when we skate past
They see us, but they stay far
Half the mandem are home
The other half, they soon come out
Word to Amzer and Bax
Looks like it's gonna be a good summer
Some friends think I've forgotten
If you do, then forgive me
We're living better lives, nigga
You was supposed to be with me
I used to wonder what the Porsche for
Till I put the pedal to the Porsche floor
Diamonds shine on the Porsche door
Top down, 44
They ain't doing nothing
I ain't listening to rappers
No Buju or Kartel
I ain't listening to ragga
I told Chip he's getting smarter
Link boss Baff by the harbour
From the north side to the gaza
Got the streets screaming wah nada, harder

[Hook]
Turn the lights down low
And let the liquor flow
Maintaining this feeling
Freedom is what we are seeking
Oh, so far, so far, so far
Our souls have been stealing
So far, so far, so far
What is this feeling?
What is this feeling?
What is this feeling?

[Outro]
Turn the lights down low, baby
We can take it slow, baby
Ain't nobody needs to know
What is this feeling?
