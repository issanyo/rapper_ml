[Skepta - Verse 1]
They say "Skepta, you must get loads of girls"
The music's picked up now
I tell em like J2k, nah, it's all switched up now
She thinks that if she talks to me they'll call
Her a groupie behind her back now
So she stands far but close enough for her pictures
To have me in the background
I'm kinda used to it now
They say its all part and parcel
And if it's this much for me
Imagine what it's like for Curtis and Marshall
I wanna go hard
But my body keeps telling me to take it easy
So I sit here watching a DVD logo bounce around the TV
My life ended ages ago, now it's all a dream
Sitting here, thinking how this whole thing all started
From What D'Ya Mean, What D'Ya Mean
Now that I'm getting that paper I heard a couple man want me dead
So I went out bought a Gucci hat and put money on my own head
I forever hear people talking like I don't know about street
Fake gangsters must think I spent my music money on chocolates and sweets
You're looking for beef in London? Nah it's not hard to find it
But I'm not scared of a gun, it's all about the man behind it

[Hook]
You wanna make it big
You think you like what you see
You wanna make it big
You saw me go from the bottom to the top
Now you wanna be me

You wanna make it big
This famous life can make some people wish they were 6 feet under
But not me
You see when I made it big
I just wish that I knew what I know now when I was younger

[Skepta - Verse 2]
Sometimes I think that I think too much
I start thinking about thinking
Then I start to get paranoid
I think my windows need tinting
They say why work all this time
To get famous Joseph
Just to have to wear sunglasses
Cause you don't wanna get noticed
Once in a while I take em off
And I'm like "arrr, that’s too bright"
Must be because I sleep all day then I wake up at night
Then I phone my girl, see if she wants to link
She said she got work in the morning
So what do I do, I go out for a drink
I spend all my time in clubs
It's starting to feel like home
I don't wanna sit in the VIP but sometimes I just wanna be left alone
I hate when I'm in a bad mood and I see all my supporters vybzin
And I apologies to anyone I've taking a pic with when I weren't smiling
They say "don't you remember me I met you at Party In The Park"
Babe, I can't even remember where I parked my car in the car park
Now she hates me and every time she hears my song she's changing the station
I swear the human brain weren't designed to deal with all this information

[Hook]
You still wanna make it big
You think you like what you see
You wanna make it big
You saw me go from the bottom to the top
Now you wanna be me

You wanna make it big
This famous life can make some people wish they were 6 feet under
But not me
You see when I made it big
I just wish that I knew what I know now when I was younger

[Bridge]
They say tomorrow isn't promised to us so
You have to enjoy today
Cause the game is like a box of roses
Cause when they're done with the chocolate
The wrapper gets thrown away
I said the wrapper gets thrown away

[Chipmunk]
When you're shooting for your targets
And it’s making you a target
You die before you live; I wish they warned me when I started
We go in full hearted, R.I.P the half wits
Cause now we're 6 feet under the top spot fuck a casket
Bastards, don't we make the lifestyle look appealing
Independent names and chains
Skepta are we dreaming?
Nobody could season, this tracks couldn't reach him
Cause now I'm on the other side of that glass ceiling
Mmm, the underdogs are off the leash
Eh Joseph, pass the muzzles and the leads
The games full of demons, lets get this arm house on
Everyone wants handouts but I ain't Stretch Armstrong
We've come so far as MC's
Round of applause or bust it off just make it clap please
I'm so past just trying to be the favourite
You're nobody until you got some haters
But you still wanna make it BIG!

[Hook - x2]
