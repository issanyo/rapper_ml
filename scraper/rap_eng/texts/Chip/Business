[Hook: Chip]
I'm just mindin' my business
Handlin' business, there's no love for you, blud, it's business
I'm just mindin' my business
Handlin' business, there's no love for you, blud, it's business

[Verse 1: Chip]
I do this for Taylor Rae, [?] and Blake
Daddy's goin' doolally if someone tries to violate me
Niggas that are in house are tryna snake me
It's a minor, nothin' in this world can break me
I have risen, I have fell, oh yes, I'm still here
Try to run up in my drum, they're lucky that I wasn't there
Trust me, I'm the one to put your money on
Last thing I do, I'm gonna make it a spare
See I'm just tryna blow and they're just tryna do the same
Started at the same place, they still haven't got a name
Yes, I clocked every snake, but remained social
Shut my mout cause I'm supposed to, not because I'm told to
I don't know what they told you, my team, I stick with it
I'm a loyal munk, I don't switch chips every minute, nah
Unlike some, their time won't come
I'll be in this limelight until my life is done

[Hook: Chip & Mark Asari]
I'm just mindin' my business
Handlin' business, there's no love for you, blud, it's business
I'm just mindin' my business
Handlin' business, there's no love for you, blud, it's business
I said I couldn't give two shits, they haven't got two hits
I've got a catalogue, now I'm movin'
I'm just mindin' my business
Handlin' business, there's no love for you, blud, it's business

[Verse 2: Chip]
And now, man are movin' up
Man might pree one of my tings and try and move it up
If she's done, she'll probably give it up
But I don't give a fuck, poom poom, forget what?
Over chicks I'll never scuff, I learnt that on the streets becuh
One man's wifey is another man's B, dog
Trust me, ayy look, I learnt that the hard way
Fear no evil, trust no gyal, I'm focusin' on my papes
Doin' tings my way, they can't always manage it
Not all decisions made are made by management
You're not a goon, you're a talker boy
Mr. Munk, I'm a boss, not a water boy
You're not that sort of boy, my fam know I'm down, G
There's just a couple man that man don't need around me
You see, I can't take these snaky heads
True love you got for man? Then you won't take offence

[Hook: Chip & Mark Asari]
I'm just mindin' my business
Handlin' business, there's no love for you, blud, it's business
I'm just mindin' my business
Handlin' business, there's no love for you, blud, it's business
I said I couldn't give two shits, they haven't got two hits
I've got a catalogue, now I'm movin'
I'm just mindin' my business
Handlin' business, there's no love for you, blud, it's business

[Verse 3: Young Spray]
You know I handle my business, leave no witness
Prove it but they know who did this
The feds got his pictures
Under the eye with the street boy features
I'm not Chip Diddy Chip, but I'll flip diddy flip
Right hook will open up your lip diddy lips
And don't slip diddy slip, cuh you know what will happen
I'm a real G, them man, they're just rapping
I swear I just slap 'em
I laugh cause while they fake it tryna make it
I'm in the manor in the banger listenin' to [?]
You know me, I'd rather take it
Young Spray, gun spray, catch me on the pavement
Look, Chippy stayed focus
Cess'll make 'em disappear like hocus pocus
Them man there some jokers
They don't handle their business, they're broke, cuz

[Hook: Chip & Mark Asari]
I'm just mindin' my business
Handlin' business, there's no love for you, blud, it's business
I'm just mindin' my business
Handlin' business, there's no love for you, blud, it's business
I said I couldn't give two shits, they haven't got two hits
I've got a catalogue, now I'm movin'
I'm just mindin' my business
Handlin' business, there's no love for you, blud, it's business
