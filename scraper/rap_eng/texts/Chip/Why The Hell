[Chorus: Chip & ManMan Savage]
Why the hell these niggas tryna fuck my bitch?
Why the hell these bitches always on my dick?
Why the hell these niggas say they serving bricks?
Why the hell them niggas say they hittin' licks?
Why the hell they lying like they flipping packs?
Why the hell they lying like they got the Act?
Why the hell you in the trap without a pack?
Why them niggas gotta lie about the sack?
Why the hell these niggas tryna fuck my bitch?
Why the hell these bitches always on my dick?
Why the hell these niggas say they serving bricks?
Why the hell them niggas say they hittin' licks?
Why the hell they lying like they flipping packs?
Why the hell they lying like they got the Act?
Why the hell you in the trap without a pack?
Why them niggas gotta lie about the sack?

[Verse 1: Chip]
Why the hell these niggas talkin' 'bout they getting money but I know they lyin' (all these niggas rich)
Why these niggas talkin' 'bout they got some shooters, ain't nobody dyin' (pew pew, where they at?)
Why the hell these niggas in the mall all the time, they ain't never buyin' (I don't know)
Why the hell the boy Chip in and out of town, man he always flyin' (MIA, and LA)
Tried to tell them niggas not to fuck around
ManMan gun 'em down, hit 'em with a hundred rounds
Bitches comin' left and right, money never up and down
You know I be with my dogs like a fucking pound
Tryna swim with some sharks, you gon' fucking drown
You the man on the block 'til I come around
I got stripes like a tiger tail, phone ringing like a bell
Don't know why I fucked the bitch, why the hell? why the hell?
Why I'm doin' a hundred with the top gone?
Why the hell you call me on a hot phone?
Why you pop a hundred bottles in the club?
You the kind of nigga bitches get the drop on
Why the hell you pillow talkin' with the swoop?
Why you showin' off a pistol you ain't finna shoot?
Why the hell you ridin' 'round with a roof?
Why you ain't spend an extra thirty and go get the coupe?

[Chorus: Chip & ManMan Savage]
Why the hell these niggas tryna fuck my bitch?
Why the hell these bitches always on my dick?
Why the hell these niggas say they serving bricks?
Why the hell them niggas say they hittin' licks?
Why the hell they lying like they flipping packs?
Why the hell they lying like they got the Act?
Why the hell you in the trap without a pack?
Why them niggas gotta lie about the sack?
Why the hell these niggas tryna fuck my bitch?
Why the hell these bitches always on my dick?
Why the hell these niggas say they serving bricks?
Why the hell them niggas say they hittin' licks?
Why the hell they lying like they flipping packs?
Why the hell they lying like they got the Act?
Why the hell you in the trap without a pack?
Why them niggas gotta lie about the sack?

[Verse 2: ManMan Savage]
Why the hell them bitches went and got a baby daddy on a nigga?
Why the hell she couldn't hold it down and stay down for a nigga?
Why the hell when I pulled out the lot they all started lookin'?
Why the hell I'm on the stage and everybody always lookin'?
Fuck a nigga bitch or somethin', ice a nigga whip or somethin'
Why you just won't give me none, oh you just keep lookin' huh?
Everybody want a piece, ain't nobody gettin' nothin'
How the hell you want my bitch? you gon' have to give me some'
I ain't never goin' for the okie-doke
Hit him with the hundred round, now I make his mama hope
Damn that nigga still alive, I hope that the nigga die, damn
No I wasn't gon' let it ride, no I wasn't gon' let it ride
Why the hell you tell and hide, nah I wasn't gon' let it fly
Why the hell you had to lie, huh?

[Chorus: Chip & ManMan Savage]
Why the hell these niggas tryna fuck my bitch?
Why the hell these bitches always on my dick?
Why the hell these niggas say they serving bricks?
Why the hell them niggas say they hittin' licks?
Why the hell they lying like they flipping packs?
Why the hell they lying like they got the Act?
Why the hell you in the trap without a pack?
Why them niggas gotta lie about the sack?
Why the hell these niggas tryna fuck my bitch?
Why the hell these bitches always on my dick?
Why the hell these niggas say they serving bricks?
Why the hell them niggas say they hittin' licks?
Why the hell they lying like they flipping packs?
Why the hell they lying like they got the Act?
Why the hell you in the trap without a pack?
Why them niggas gotta lie about the sack?
