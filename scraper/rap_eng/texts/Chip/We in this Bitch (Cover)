[Intro: (Chip) & {DJ Drama}]
{DJ Drama
London Boy} (yeah)
{Chip!}
(I just wanna
Let the beat play for a bit
(Fuck that shit I'm going in)

[Verse: Chip]
Yeah, visionary thoughts, hell yeah I see the money
We in this bitch like some unborn puppies
Drink away the pain
Smoke away my lungs
Young dumb and 21 we just having fun
She wants me to hit it raw but I ain't ready
Jesus Lord, three abortions already
Please forgive me
I know that karma's a bitch
I kinda feel it when my brother's on Skype with his kids
There's still a gap in my heart that needs filling
It's hard to find a balance when you're sinnin' but you're winnin'
Thinkin' 'bout my little sister everytime I rap
Kill it, yes I will, see I'll be nice when I die
Murder with the bars I'm killing the scene
So I don't need sleep I'm living the dream
Shouts to ?Tyronne and Ram?, they reppin' for me
C-M-A-R, yeah I'm still reppin' the team
Niggas still hatting we don't really care
Fuck a waste man, we ambitious over here-
My teacher said be a teacher I'll make 40k a year
Now I'm looking at my wrist that's 40k over here
Rappers going at me
I don't really listen
If they were better than me?
They'd be in my position
Travelin' the world, puttin' on for my birthplace-
Try deny my talent but you can't deny my word play
