[Hook] (x2)
Sometimes in life you'll fall apart
Sometimes in life you'll break your heart
One day you'll realise
That you'll be alright

[Verse 1]
Have you ever trusted someone that left you on your back? (Chyeah)
Loved someone that just never loved you back? (It's mad)
Ever lusted something you can't have? (Yep)
Tryna live right just with the devil on your back (Two minds)
I'm so young but my life's so nuts (So nuts)
I've come across a couple of two faced cunts (Believe)
Come across a couple of gold digging sluts (Little slags)
But I don't even drop them a nut (Naa)
Do you ever wake up like, why do I work for? (Yep)
I'm worth a lot more than I work for (Everyday)
Just saving up for something you can't afford (Stress)
But having it's such a lovely thought (Yes)
Ever warred with your closest of people? (Your family)
Over the root of all evil (The money)
Like sometimes I think my life's worthless
Besides spitting bars, what is my purpose?

[Hook] (x2)
Sometimes in life you'll fall apart
Sometimes in life you'll break your heart
One day you'll realise
That you'll be alright

[Verse 2]
Sometimes I just fall to cry (Cry)
Thinking of my loved ones that died
Bare letters on the fridge
Water in my fam's eyes (Mummy)
Thinking how I'm gonna make it right
Everything will be alright! (or will it?)
Then again it might not be (Naa)
A role model lives his life properly (Believe)
It's funny that they're looking up to Chip (Uhh)
But Chip feels to jump off a bridge
But fly not die (I swear)
Cause I don't think I'm suicidal
Slim Shady Chip teenagers' newest idol (C's up)
But sometimes I need my own space
But everybody's all up in my face
Managements on my case
Yeah I like getting paid (Who doesn't?)
But I don't want an interview today (Or tomorrow)
There's only so much my mind can take
And my ends with the friends too phase and snakes

[Hook] (x2)
Sometimes in life you'll fall apart
Sometimes in life you'll break your heart
One day you'll realise
That you'll be alright
