[Verse 1:  Chipmunk]
From the age of ten I used to do a paper round
Just so I could see the paper round
So I could splash in the corner shop
And buy sweets till my teeth would rot
I used to play football, I used to like dancing
Man I tried everything, even karate
After 5 years I had to pull it
Caah a blackbelt can't teach you how to dodge bullets
I never knew what I wanted to be or
Knew what the man above wanted for me
They said Jahmaal your smart enough to be a doctor, or a lawyer
But fuck that them jobs are boring
And footie's getting dry, I like raving
But shout out to Craig Eastmond cause he made it
I don't know my profession yet quite
But one day I'm gunna get signed

[Chorus: Jermaine Riley]
Just write the cheque
I'm out here spending money so I gotta make it
Just to make it
Things are different so
Don't you take this shit for granted
When the money's in your hand yeah

[Verse 2 : Chipmunk]
My big bro's MC'in now
I might have to try this out
And Dizzee Rascal's on tv now
Shit, this could be my way out
Good at English but I hate reading
Good grades, just a few exclusions
My story's inspirational
And with the right help I can execute this out to the nations
Or my words can lock down the pavement
Skip Jammer's basement, eskimo dance and sidewinders
Take it straight to the big stages That'll be amazing
But damn I gotta make some
I'm doing it independent, spent before you make some
Think I know my profession now guys, damn I got stars in my eyes

[Chorus: Jermaine Riley]
Just write the cheque
I'm out here spending money so I gotta make it
Just to make it
Things are different so
Don't you take this shit for granted
When the money's in your hand yeah

[Interlude: Chipmunk]
If you ever knew what was getting sold
Just so we can pay for videos
AR from the bottom we roll
So when the cheques came the first hundred bags got blown
Shoutouts to Boy Better Know, me and skeppy from the north side we charted on our own
So they approached us, we never approached the majors
And now look, we majors

[Chorus: Jermaine Riley]
Just write the cheque
I'm out here spending money so I gotta make it
Just to make it
Things are different so
Don't you take this shit for granted
When the money's in your hand yeah

Just write the cheque
I'm out here spending money so I gotta make it
Just to make it
Things are different so
Don't you take this shit for granted
When the money's in your hand yeah
