[Verse 1: Ironik]
Hold me close, you're just to far
Or I can bring you in, so you're right up with the stars
But still down to earth, with our love, we're on Mars
I can give you the chance to be what they can't
I just wanna be sure
That you're not the type to just open doors
I've gone so far to be what I can
I've worked so hard to be where I am
So I'll just...

[Pre-Chorus: Ironik]
Hold you closer and won't let go
I need to know how you feel too
So hold me closer and don't let go
I'm falling so please just don't let go

[Chorus: Elton John]
Hold me closer, tiny dancer (hold me closer, just hold me closer)
Count the headlights on the highway (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Lay me down in sheets of linen (lay me down, just lay me down)
You had a busy day today (uhh uhh uhh)

[Verse 2: Chipmunk]
C's
Mr Munk is immaculate
I ain't stylish, I'm sky-lish, yes, my levels so up there
My lady's adjacent, I smell her fragrance
And whats under my Armanis goes up there
Now I'm in the mood, full salute
No bubberoose, just apple juice
And she ain't ever got to tell me hold her closer
Cause the girls on the trol ain't getting closer
Munk

[Pre-Chorus: Ironik]
Hold you closer and won't let go
I need to know how you feel too
So hold me closer and don't let go
I'm falling so please just don't let go

[Chorus: Elton John]
Hold me closer, tiny dancer (hold me closer, just hold me closer)
Count the headlights on the highway (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Lay me down in sheets of linen (lay me down, just lay me down)
You had a busy day today (uhh uhh uhh)

[Bridge: Ironik]
M-U-S-I-C
I've gone so far, I've worked so hard, listen
I hope you recognise what you really mean
Without you, I couldn't do this song I sing
I hope you like it too, cause it's nothing but the truth
You're not number one but you will be soon, so I'll

[Pre-Chorus: Ironik]
Hold you closer and won't let go
I need to know how you feel too
So hold me closer and don't let go
I'm falling so please just don't let go

[Chorus: Elton John]
Hold me closer, tiny dancer
Count the headlights on the highway
Lay me down in sheets of linen
You had a busy day today

[Chorus: Elton John]
Hold me closer, tiny dancer (hold me closer, just hold me closer)
Count the headlights on the highway (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Lay me down in sheets of linen (lay me down, just lay me down)
You had a busy day today (uhh uhh uhh)
