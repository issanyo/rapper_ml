[Verse 1: Chip]
Yeah, this is my surrender flow
I'm November cold
Place your palm left on my chest
Can you feel a heart of gold?
When you look into my eyes
Can you see your own reflection?
Are you scared that this is perfect?
Trying to find my imperfections
See I've been around the world
I feel at home inside you
Grip me like some handlebars
And I might let you ride too
I can help you to control
Those emotions up inside ya
I promise to be your Sampson
Just don’t do me like Delilah
Uh, puffing on that sour
Thinking for a minute
What we could do in a hour
I’m down for whatever, wherever
Whenever, I’m the type to let ya
You tell me my smile is cute
I use my teeth just to undress ya, uh
So come and come through
I’ll send your body on a trip as long as I can come too
Just me and you
I've been sipping on this wine
Smoking through this all
Don’t turn the lights off, dim em
I welcome you to my zone

[Chorus: Delilah]
Help me, help me baby
Make love to you
Teach me, as I could pay
I know what I'd do
Screaming give me all you've got
(Welcome to my zone, when I'm inside you, I feel home)
Teach me, boy, make me tell my God

[Verse 2: Chip]
Through them winter nights, I can keep you warm
If I hit you like a lightning bolt, could you weather the storm?
Please be warned, I've got sides I do not show
Maybe you'll unveil
When we touch it helps me read you
If love is blind, you my braille
Chest to chest I can feel your heart beating next to mine
What’s the time? I can feel the sun
Creeping through the blinds
You say you can’t take the heat
Love them things you do with ice
I don’t like a girl who doesn't
Me, I love a girl who tries
Yeah, tango takes two
I’ll pay for that dinner if dessert is on you
Yeah you know I come to life when the moon's out
She’ll be biting like a carnal when I let my wolf out yeah
Whenever you come through
I’ll send your body on a trip as long as I can come too
It's me and you, I've been sipping on this wine
And smoking through this all
Don’t turn the lights off, dim em
I welcome you to my zone

[Chorus: Delilah]

[Bridge: Delilah]
Help me!
You know, atmosphere is everything
Real music
Sometimes I wonder how it goes

[Chorus: Delilah]
