[Pre-Chorus: Pixie Lott & VV Brown]
When there's nowhere else to run
Is there room for one more son, one more son
If you just hold on, if you just hold on
Hold on

[Chorus: All]
I got soul but I'm not a soldier
I got soul but I'm not a soldier
I got soul but I'm not a soldier
I got soul but I'm not a soldier

(Instrumental)

[Pre-Chorus: Frankmusik & Tulisa (N-Dubz)]
When there's nowhere else to run
Is there room for one more son, one more son
If you just hold on, if you just on hold on, hold on

[Chorus: All]
I got soul but I'm not a soldier
I got soul but I'm not a soldier
I got soul but I'm not a soldier
I got soul but I'm not a soldier

(Instrumental)

[Pre-Chorus]
When you think your battles are won
Then you find it's left undone, left undone
If you can't hold on, if you can't hold on
Hold on

[Chorus: All]
I got soul but I'm not a soldier
I got soul but I'm not a soldier
I got soul but I'm not a soldier
I got soul but I'm not a soldier

[Chorus: All]
I got soul but I'm not a soldier
I got soul but I'm not a soldier
I got soul but I'm not a soldier
I got soul but I'm not a soldier
I got soul but I'm not a soldier
I got soul but I'm not a soldier
I got soul but I'm not a soldier
I got soul but I'm not a soldier
I'm not a solider
Yea yea yea yea

[Bridge: All, Frankmusik & Dappy]
Yeah you now you gotta help me out
Yeah oh don't you put me on the back burn no
You now you gotta help me out yeah
You gonna bring yourself down
Over and in, let us call for sin
Where everyone loves the battle is one
With all these things that I have done

[Chorus: All]
I got soul but I'm not a soldier
I got soul but I'm not a soldier
I got soul but I'm not a soldier
I got soul but I'm not a soldier
