[Intro: Chip]
You know when them ones just got bare tings to say about man?
And no one don't even really know me
Addressed to you

[Verse 1: Chip]
Those who taught the world the shit about me
Don't even know shit about me
Talk is cheap, so they afford it still
They wanna eat off Chippy's plate but they can't afford the bill
And I've heard it all before
Cuss who's on top, been there before
Another kid sending, I've heard it before
They talk like they ain't heard me before
I'm done with supporting the cause, ayy, look, man
I don't bite bars, I'm teething
They just bite the hands that feed 'em
Wanna diss Chip but they need him
Say what you like
Cuzzy, do your thing, I'mma do mine
Cuzzy, do you and I'mma do I
And I ain't selling out grime
I'm just selling out grime (units)
And now that I'm on top
They wanna help me down, fine

[Hook: Chip](x2)
Say what you like, I couldn't give a rock scully
I does me, I do me, that's why I gets money
I never tried to be something I wasn't, fam
And that's why your opinion doesn't bother man

[Verse 2: Skepta]
Yo, Chippy said I can say what I like
So let me spit the real ghetto gospel into the mic
No word of a lie, no hype
A lot of these MCs couldn't be badboys on the road
So they picked up their pen and paper
And tried to get a little sly
But I ain't in it, a lot of these MCs diss us
But they don't hate us
It's just an excuse to say my crew's name in a lyric
You make an album to showcase your talent
But instead, Ghetto made Freedom of Speech
And said my name every two minutes
Man wanna go to the mountain
Go to shows on the tour bus
Next time, make an album, not a CD full of war dubs
And next time you want a beat, just call us
And I don't mean to be funny
Before Devilman disses me again
He better get his bank card, go to the bank
And give Maxi some money
Yeah? I'm out
Actually
Man better stop calling me bruv and fam
And you ain't even been to my house, show

[Hook: Chip](x2)
Say what you like, I couldn't give a rock scully
I does me, I do me, that's why I gets money
I never tried to be something I wasn't, fam
And that's why your opinion doesn't bother man

[Verse 3: Wiley]
Yo, made "Eskimo" when I weren't looking
I made "Snowman" when I never had a booking
You ain't real, can't carry out orders
You've got a lot to learn, more to put in
I've had 'em up in a 24 bar rally
Was a sinner on night bus, now I get Â£2 grand bookings
Even vinyl got sold
And I was shotting 'em out the car boot
That's why I can't leave
When I try and leave, can't breathe
I would rather live amongst thieves
When I walk through the park, a whirlwind of leaves
Surround me, I'm blessed but my name ain't Jeez
I get Ps, I know this game
As well as I know about the birds and the bees
So it don't make sense convincing me
I ain't no otherwise, you won't peek around me
Don't rap with Eski, the champ is Eski
The camp is dangerous, words don't affect me
If I was at your stage show, you wouldn't detect me
Never sent for my troops cause I protect me, fam
I protect me
The England manager, he would select me
Still a badboy like DJ Maximum
[?] please witness, haters can't forget me

[Outro: Wiley]
Say what you like, init
I'll say what I like, init
Fucking shit mix CDs that you're putting out on the fucking road
Likkle mix CD where you bill up when you're in your likkle studio when you bill up likkle shit
