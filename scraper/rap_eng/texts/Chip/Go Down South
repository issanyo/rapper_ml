Money going up
Girls Going down
Didn't know me then
Bet you know me now
Don't care where you're from just use your brain
Heads up going down south
Going down south
Going down south
Going down south

Don't care where you're from just use your brain
Heads up going down south

Verse 1:[Krept]
Madness, with a bad bitch
In-between her buns going H.A.M thats a sandwich
I can have you come in, labrinth
Handle't you won't stop bus, traffic
She said im hot chocolate with mean swag
When a whore licks, I get a tea bag
Spent 3 bags on 3 bags
Come shop watch the white stick, we had
Your girl said she at a seminar
But word to the scottish its my house where she heading bruh
Bare noise when I get in her
Neighbors can't handle the racket, Federer
When I cruise by
They like you fly
Ask the Arabs About The brands﻿ That I do buy
I'm the man, I'm the man, Im the man
So she wanna toss my salad food fight

[Verse 2: chipmunk]
Aiming at your girl got my stick as a﻿ trigger
Call me John Terry, I don't really fuck with niggers
Tia and tamera y'know I can handle sisters
Virgins know I get it popping, blisters
Telescopes out y'know you looking at a star
All I do is splash, put me in the water park
No tints on the ride they be looking all hard
Spent a car on the watch why you watching the car
At least once a month I be in the papers
Fuck me and sell the story you'll be famous
Might want seconds cos im first class right
I can take you on your first, first class flight
She said chip' I wanna beat don't tell my ex
Says she plays dirty over she krept
Life is a gamble flip a coin yes
Go down south it landed on heads

[Verse 3: Yungen]
Make a toast, I'm﻿ finally getting my bread right
I'm in the club on my ones on a dead night
This ting ambers giving me the red light
I be prada-erd off sippin a red stripe
I don't jam man the girl﻿ know am donuts
She like yung' man you really need to grow up
I put ma tower in-between her twin and make her complain till a blow up
A little jerk but she really wanna fling
Moving rice to get pz, it ain't a ting
Food man, I used to have money in cling
Now my moneys in BANKS - BADA BOOM BADA BING

[Verse 4: Konan]
Said I'm all about the capital I told her from the start
Heard me on the radio and now she wants my heart
But im all about the paper you can tell by the voice
Left her with a kiss cah I really got a choice
They told me go six, and I was like we be in
Give your girl a beat, 120 BPM
The weeds got me parro, girls think im shallow
Cause I got so much adds on my bbm
And after my giggs they usually wana party
So I take em to the park and I get inside the nani
Or its back to the villa, she creaming already
Im far from chavy but I leave the bed messy
Got a bally on my top its bringing like the crook in me
Heard I got chips, now they wanna look for me
They know that im for real, just take one look at me
I used to load clips, now I'm trynna push a t
