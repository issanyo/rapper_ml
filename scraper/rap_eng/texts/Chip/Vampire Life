[Chorus]
Vampire life I don't sleep more time
Get up in the morning, was you on your grind?
You stay there thinking you can take your time
You'd be surprised how quick the years go by
Left a couple niggas on the 079
I don't need yours, nigga I be getting mine
You stay there thinking you can take your time
You'd be surprised how quick the years go by

[Verse 1]
My niggas rapping and trapping, that's how their days go
You niggas lacking, you slacking, you'd rather stay home
Get the money, we travelling when I say so
London niggas popping bottles out in Greystone
It been years in the game but we here though
Drinking, sippin' and thinkin' like where the years go?
They say my opps in the dance "I be like where though?"
Niggas thinking I'm slipping, my niggas here though

[Chorus]
Vampire life I don't sleep more time
Get up in the morning, was you on your grind?
You stay there thinking you can take your time
You'd be surprised how quick the years go by
Left a couple niggas on the 079
I don't need yours, nigga I be getting mine
You stay there thinking you can take your time
You'd be surprised how quick the years go by

[Verse 2]
Was them youngers on the come up, now we flexing
Dripping in it, see the ice on my necklace
Either working or playing, we never resting
You niggas bummy for money, my niggas restless
Penthouse suite with a clear view
I don't see no pagans in my rear view
I'm just celebrating life i'm with my whole crew
Said she heard that it's poppin see wanna roll through

[Chorus]
Vampire life I don't sleep more time
Get up in the morning, was you on your grind?
You stay there thinking you can take your time
You'd be surprised how quick the years go by
Left a couple niggas on the 079
I don't need yours, nigga I be getting mine
You stay there thinking you can take your time
You'd be surprised how quick the years go by

[Verse 3]
Gotta stay in my zone, switching different time zones
Years in the game cah' the future's where my mind goes
Youngers saying I'm old, olders saying I've grown up
Never go off track got them in between the line flows
Time flies, waste yours, can't waste mine
Create settings for my bars, can't afford to waste time
Every line counts, can't afford to waste lines
Cah' my nigga still keeps his suttin' on his waistline
We need to reach a level where he never has to buss it
Ain't nobody hatin' everybody lovin'
Niggas couldn't keep up with the hustle, they ain't coming
Fuck a half heart, give it all or give nothing
What the fuck these niggas intending
Fuck these niggas and their intentions
There's more life pending
Vampire life man don't sleep, man work
You sleep more than you work, then don't sleep on this verse

[Chorus]
Vampire life I don't sleep more time
Get up in the morning, was you on your grind?
You stay there thinking you can take your time
You'd be surprised how quick the years go by
Left a couple niggas on the 079
I don't need yours, nigga I be getting mine
You stay there thinking you can take your time
You'd be surprised how quick the years go by
