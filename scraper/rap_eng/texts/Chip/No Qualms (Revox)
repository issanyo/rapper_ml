[Hook: Jme]
I wear my own garms
Man see me on road and want arms
I wear my own garms
Man see me on road and want arms
I wear my own garms
Man see me on road and want arms
Tell dem shut your mout, there's no qualms
(Listen, shut your mout, there's no)

[Verse 1: Chip]
Yo, I wear my own clothes
Strictly buy, never borrow
I'm like Mavado, no one rocks the garms harder
T-shirt, fresh creps, stunners and jeans
That's what keeps all the gyal dem keen
I write my own bars, wear my own garms
Bare exclusives, that's how I do this
So fly, I could shoulder-barge stars
And gyal dem a wish when Chippy flies past
Gotta look crisp, I'm a rising star
In the music, image is right
Boy, you won't get a deal just cause you got bars
I'm cool cuh my image is fine
If you ain't got one, allow copying mine
I write my own bars, drop my own garms
One day I'll start my own clothing line

[Hook: Jme]
I wear my own garms
Man see me on road and want arms
I wear my own garms
Man see me on road and want arms
I wear my own garms
Man see me on road and want arms
Tell dem shut your mout, there's no qualms

[Verse 2: Jme]
I wear my own garms
Man see me on road and want arms
Tell dem shut your mout, there's no qualms
Rudeboy, why the lip? Why the squalms?
Dem way there, I rock my own tees
Man see me and think I've got Ps
I say "ayo fam, you know me"
Still hustling for my food to eat
Dem way there, I make my own bags
Man see me for internet rags
Giving them out for free? Are you mad
Bare garms, I don't need to pop tags
Dem way there, I've got my own crep
Man see me and watch where they step
Tell dem shut your mout, we're the best
Boy Better Know, that is what I rep

[Hook: Jme]
I wear my own garms
Man see me on road and want arms
I wear my own garms
Man see me on road and want arms
I wear my own garms
Man see me on road and want arms
Tell dem shut your mout, there's no qualms
(Listen, shut your mout, there's no)

[Verse 3: Skepta]
Skepta, I wear my own T-shirt
Girls see me in the party and flirt
I don't tell dem "shut your mout"
I tell dem "well done, you found a diamond in dirt"
Boy Better Know T-shirt, that's my ting
I've got a black one of these with white writing
White one of these with black writing at my house
But you can have this one if you come back to the hotel
Lethal said he's got tees as well
Told him "shut your mout, they won't sell
You can't school me about T-shirt Ps"
Oi Jme, wah gwan for the summer collection?
Boy Better Know tees
I just saw some G-Star RAW tops, they look kinda greaze
Gotta put these other designers on freeze

[Hook: Jme]
I wear my own garms
Man see me on road and want arms
I wear my own garms
Man see me on road and want arms
I wear my own garms
Man see me on road and want arms
Tell dem shut your mout, there's no qualms
(Tell dem shut your mout, there's no qualms cause)

[Verse 4: Wiley]
Cause I wear my own garms
Remix, I wear my own garms
Remix, I wear my own summer collection
In the winter, wear my own scarves
And my wardrobe's silly, all the new garms I've got
They're so fresh like [?]
And some days, I'm a night town parrer
On other days, I'm a LON barrer
See the dress sense I've got? It would've hit sixes
At the Oval like Bilara
You can ask Dominique, you can ask Cara
Wear my own trainers, got my own lana
And I ain't from Smallville
But I've got the fashion locked down like crops to a farmer
You see me, I wear my own bracelet
Chain and watch, I wear my own Prada

[Hook: Jme]
I wear my own garms
Man see me on road and want arms
I wear my own garms
Man see me on road and want arms
I wear my own garms
Man see me on road and want arms
Tell dem shut your mout, there's no qualms
