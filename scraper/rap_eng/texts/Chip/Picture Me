Every time you feel like you cannot go on
You feel so lost and
That you're so alone
All you see is night
And darkness all around
You feel so helpless
You can't see which way to go
Don't despair n' never loose hope
Cos' Allah is always by your side

Insha Allah [x3]

Insha Allah you'll find your way

Insha Allah [x3]

Every time you commit one more mistake
You feel you can't repent
And that it's way too late
You're so confused
Wrong decisions you have made
Hunt your mind and your heart is full of shame
Don't despair and never loose hope
Cos' Allah is always by your side

Insha Allah [x3]

Insha Allah you'll find your way

Insha Allah [x3]

Insha Allah you'll find your way
Turn to Allah
He's never far away
Put your trust in Him Raise your hands and pray Oh
Ya Allah
Guide my steps don't let me go astray
You're the only one that showed me the way
Showed me the way [x2]

Insha Allah [x3]

Insha Allah we'll find our way
