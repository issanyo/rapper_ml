Chipz versus the most fearsome of the seven seas
Captain James Hook
Here we go!
Nanananana
Ohoh wah oh wee oh (4x)
Hes back, the man with the hook
Back again
The king of the pirates
We jump, into the book
You dont wanna miss the adventure
This is a pirates life
I guess it is
This time were gonna fight
Come on, were ready
And all you have to do
Just think one happy thought
And you will fly again
(Revenge is mine)

[Chorus]
Captain Hook, Captain Hook
And Peter Pan
Captain Hook, Captain Hook
In Neverland
Youre such a crook
Now, Captain Hook
One can tell by your look
Captain Hook
Nanananana
Ohoh wah oh wee oh (2x)
Tinkerbell and the Lost Boys are here
In line, on a quest for the treasure
We stand without any fear
We gonna blow them out of the water
This is a pirates life
I guess it is
This time were gonna fly
Come on, were ready
And all you have to do
Just think one happy thought
And you will fly again
(Do it again)

[Chorus] (2x)
Peter, come back and fight me
Haha
Are you ready, poppy
Hahahaha
He crows, he fights, he flies
Muahahahahaha
Nanananana
Ohoh wah oh wee oh (2x)
You are such a crook
Now, Captain Hook
One can tell by your look

[Chorus]
