Party just done and she calling
I know you been sippin' all night
Thought you might pull up no warning
No, tights, on, those, thighs
That's what I like
She don't, ever, mind, giving, brain
Shows i'm on her mind
Ja Rule baby know i'm always on time
I ain't no singer but she loves when I try
Give me all your loving baby

When I say I wanna make you whine
Don't mean make you cry

[Pre: Chip]

When I fling you on your all 4's

Turn off the lights scented candles for the vibe
Window to your soul so i'm looking in your eyes
Only live once before you leave do it twice

Good girl, living in the hood girl
Come and take this, wood girl
Love it when you, bad for me
