[Chorus: Fetty Wap]
Baby, won't you come my way?
Got something I want to say
Cannot keep you out my brain
But first off, I'ma start by sayin' this, ayy
All headshots if you think you could take my bitch, ayy
And I'm too turnt, when I shoot, swear I won't miss, ayy
Ba-baby, won't you come my way?
Baby, won't you come my way?

[Verse: Chip]
Yeah, she said that she wanna turn up
Said I wanna turn up too
See me in a Cash Motto party
Paw Gang, turn up crew
She said she wanna go studio
Took her to my wardrobe room
Told JC set the mic up
Chippy don't need no booth
Nah, Chippy don't need no hoes
Chippy don't need no friends (ayy, bun all of dat)
Cuh when I needed everyone most
That is when everyone left
Nah, worldwide know about Tottenham, man
You can't fool my ends
All I need in this life of sin
Is love, my engineer and a pen (oi, Chip, keep snappin')
It was just me and my amigos
When I came back from the future (mad)
'Cause dem man sound like Migos
Dem man sound like Future (mad)
But dem man can't be Migos
Dem man can't be Future
Can't do rap and still do grime
So fuck off, can't be Chipmunk either (mad)
I've had niggas come at me
'Cause I make songs for the women
Should've seen 'em a couple months later
Tryna make songs for the women
Hypocrites, gotta kill 'em (blukubyebyebye)
On all types of riddims (blukubyebyebye)
Peng tings come my way
Cuh they know seh the mandem's winning
Look at the vibe I'm bringin'
Look in my eyes, I'm missin'
Look in my heart, I'm pure
It's just the times that we live in
Niggas buildin' bridges
I commend it, I assisted, then I had the vision
Yeah, born champion, listen

[Chorus: Fetty Wap and Chip]
Baby, won't you come my way? (Rap vs. Grime, dun know)
Got something I want to say
Cannot keep you out my brain
But first off, I'ma start by sayin' this, ayy
All headshots if you think you could take my bitch, ayy
And I'm too turnt, when I shoot, swear I won't miss, ayy
Ba-baby, won't you come my way?
