[Intro: (Chip) & {DJ Drama}]
{DJ Drama
London Boy} (yeah)
{Chip!}
(I just wanna
Let the beat play for a bit
(Fuck that shit I'm going in)

[Verse: Chip]
Yeah, visionary thoughts, hell yeah I see the money
We in this bitch like some unborn puppies
Drink away the pain
Smoke away my lungs
Young dumb and 21 we just havin fun
She wants me to hit it raw but I ain’t ready
Jesus Lord, three abortions already
Please forgive me
I know that karma’s a bitch
I kinda feel it when my brother's on Skype with his kids
There’s still a gap in my heart that needs fillin
It’s hard to find the balance when you’re sinning but you’re winnin
Thinkin' 'bout my little sister every time I rap
Kill it yes I will so you’ll be nice when I die
Murder with the bars I’m killin the scene
So I don’t need sleep I’m living the dream
Shouts to ?Tyronne and Ram?, they reppin' for me
C-M-A-R, yeah I'm still reppin' the team
Niggas still hatin we don’t really care
Fuck a waste man we ambitious over here
My teacher said be a teacher I'll make 40k a year
Now I’m looking at my wrist that’s 40k over there
Rappers going at me
I don't really listen
If they were better than me?
They'd be in my position
Travel in the world, putting on for my birthplace
Try deny my talent but you can’t deny my word play
