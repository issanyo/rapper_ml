[Intro: Eric Bellinger]
This gon' be your favorite song

[Verse 1: Eric Bellinger]
Oh,, is that your new man?
You look good on his arm
What you say, you got a baby on the way?
That's cool, I don't mean no harm
Oh, he got you a new bag
To keep a smile on your face
But you ain't even into all that
You know he needs to be replaced

[Chorus: Eric Bellinger]
Instead of being all drastic
I'd rather be sarcastic
Oh, you said our love was ever lasting
It's like my heart was made of plastic
More power to you, pysch
More power to you, pysch
More power to you
You know I'm just being sarcastic, yeah, yeah

[Verse 2: Eric Bellinger]
What's that on your hand?
I'm acting like I ain't notice
I guess he did what he can
I'm trying hard to keep it in focus
Oh, but everything's all good
Good as it's gon' get
Girl, I been off you
In fact I'd rather take the chance

[Chorus: Eric Bellinger]
Instead of being all drastic
I'd rather be sarcastic
Oh, you said our love was ever lasting
It's like my heart was made of plastic
More power to you, pysch
More power to you, pysch
More power to you
You know I'm just being sarcastic, yeah, yeah, yeah
Instead of being all drastic, you don't love him, you love him
I'd rather be sarcastic, you don't need him, you don't need him
Oh, you said our love is ever lasting, you don't want him, you don't want him
It's like my heart would be of plastic, you don't love him
More power to you, pysch
More power to you, pysch
More power to you
You know I'm just being sarcastic, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 3: Chipmunk]
Yeah, forget another situation, too serious
'Cause girls come and go like periods
Period, you taught me that
I got a love receipt, can I take it back?
I don't wanna see you happy 'less it's with me
You hearts iceberg, the rest is history
It's just a matter of time before you wake
I got a fuck waitin' for you anytime you want a break, yeah

[Chorus: Eric Bellinger]
Instead of being all drastic
I'd rather be sarcastic
Oh, you said our love was ever lasting
It's like my heart was made of plastic
More power to you, pysch
More power to you, pysch
More power to you
You know I'm just being sarcastic, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Outro: Eric Bellinger]
You don't love him, you don't love him
You don't need him, you don't need him. girl
You know I'm just being sarcastic
Being sarcastic
