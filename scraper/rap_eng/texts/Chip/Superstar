I wanna be a superstar
You ever wanted something so bad, you’d sacrifice your
Whole life for it
I wanna be a superstar
Take a walk in my crep
C’s up! (here we go)
I wanna be a superstar
Yeah, that’s the money the fame the paps the mags the
Cheques the cash but I don’t want the stress
I wanna be a superstar
To be the best of the best I’ma work til I’m dead
Wanna be a superstar nothing more nothing less
Dress to impress without trying look I got CD’s who’s
Buying
At 15 I wasn’t paid in full but I know I had pradas in
School, (I was flash)
Uniform with the fly jacket, rack sack to match it
Swagger I had it
Young and easy in front of the camera making all the
Pretty girls go mad
See the yearbook said I was most likely to be famous
Points proved now I can't live my life nameless
So I hit the studs
Started cutting tunes
Minimal facilities in Ironiks room, but we made do
Still came through
Haters still talking shit so fuck you
Lord knows when I started writing bars never ever
Thought I’d hit the charts
Yeah yeah, C’s up!
I wanna be a superstar
Yeah, that’s the money the fame the paps the mags the
Cheques the cash but I don’t want the stress
I wanna be a superstar
To be the best of the best I’ma work til I’m dead
Wanna be a superstar nothing more nothing less
Age 17 I was spittin raw Chip Diddy Chip went and
Kicked off a riddim war
And one label said I just ain't marketable
Now who runs the market fool, me!
I got the hot verse everybody wants buy
Wanna be on everybodys so nigga fuck that
Tryina cut but so see whos daring, sharing ain't always
Caring
I got the haters nostrils flaring, smelling success
Got em way stressed
Got em way vexed, thinking I fell off you wanna come
Test
You can go fuck yourself, no latex
I ent tryina sleep for life, I’m tryina bring my dream
To life
Feeling like I ought to fly, don’t ask me why, C’s up!
I’m wanna be a superstar
Yeah, that’s the money the fame the paps the mags the
Cheques the cash but I don’t want the stress
I’m wanna be a superstar
To be the best of the best I’ma work til I’m dead
Wanna be a superstar nothing more nothing less
I was too fast learning to rhyme now talent got me
Caught up living two lives
Chart topper everybody know my name but the hood
Doesn’t ever change
It’s worse when you paid and I’m still the same
In my own zone, from the youth club to a live band
Live show, street dreams of a teen from the high roll
The pap lights blind my eyes, bro
I wanna be a superstar
Yeah, that’s the money the fame the paps the mags the
Cheques the cash but I don’t want the stress
I wanna be a superstar
To be the best of the best I’ma work til I’m dead
Wanna be a superstar nothing more nothing less
I wanna be a superstar
Yeah, that’s the money the fame the paps the mags the
Cheques the cash but I don’t want the stress
I wanna be a superstar
To be the best of the best I’ma work til I’m dead
Wanna be a superstar nothing more nothing less
