[Verse 1: Nafe Smallz]

Light if you bad, light if you bad
I'm throwing this cash, I'm throwing this cash (yeah)
Shake it if you bad, she shake it if she bad (yeah)
Popping off some tags, popping off some tags
I just dropped a bag on some Gucci (yeah)
Light it up, I just came off a trip (yeah, yeah)
Light it up, roll up one with the kid (yeah, yeah)
We staying up, the hotel popping all night (yeah, yeah)
We smokin' up, we smokin' up
Smoking for the night (yeah, yeah)
Roll up another blunt, they ain't as fly as us
No, no they don't walk as high as us
I got ego's both side of us in case we gotta turn it up (yeah)
They said they gon rise on us but them niggas won't die for us so
I don't want them niggas trust, no I don't want them niggas trust (Don't want them niggas trust)

[Chorus: Nafe Smallz]

Light if you bad, light if you bad
I'm throwing this cash, I'm throwing this cash (yeah)
Shake it if you bad, she shake it if she bad (yeah)
Popping off some tags, popping off some tags
I just dropped a bag on some Gucci (yeah)

[Verse 2: Chip]
Living that life, booking them flights
Turn up all day and all night (yeah)
Why do I drink, why do you think?
Shut up, you're killing my vibe (yeah)
Ice cream cone, she want the cone, told her don't waste my time (yeah)
Ain't no spliff without chip, don't ask me why I'm high (yeah)
Popping or what (wagwarn)
Rose nectar and pop (Buss dat)
She asked if I'm fucking or not
Took out her bottom but I want the top
I didn't drive, I took a cab (Skrrr)
Cause if jakes pull me its mad (Gone)
Cah we on mission to get frass
Tell her light this if you bad
She spent a bag on some loubs
I spent a bag on some food
Heard that I'm eating its true, got so much weed in the room, feel like a shotta fi true
No I don't go the distance
You on coke then I'm distant
Natural high as an infant
Now there's weed in my system

[Chorus: Nafe Smallz]

Light if you bad, light if you bad
I'm throwing this cash, I'm throwing this cash (yeah)
Shake it if you bad, she shake if she bad (yeah)
Popping off some tags, popping off some tags
I just dropped a bag on some Gucci (yeah)

[Verse 3: Nafe Smallz]
Hold up, hold up, hold up wait
Call up the plug, I need some more weed
She like the way I rock the Balmain's
Smoke out the wraith, the ganja get blazed
Turn up to raves, your man will get paid
When I shutdown shows, the mandem on stage (yeah)
And I don't fuck no hoes, the gyaldem prestige
Roll up another blunt, they ain't as fly as us
No, no they don't walk as high as us
I got ego's both side of us in case we gotta turn it up (yeah)
They said they gon rise on us but them niggas don't die for us so
I don't want them niggas trust, no I don't want them niggas trust (Don't want them niggas trust)

[Chorus: Nafe Smallz]

Light if you bad, light if you bad
I'm throwing this cash, I'm throwing this cash (yeah)
Shake it if you bad, she shake if she bad (yeah)
Popping off some tags, popping off some tags
I just dropped a bag on some Gucci (yeah)
