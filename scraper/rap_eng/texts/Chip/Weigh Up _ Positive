["Weigh Up"]

[Intro: Chip]
I just wanna hear loud music
Oi, when's the drop?
Yeah

[Verse 1: Chip]
This is that loud music
That under influence loud music
I don't rave to meet new women
I just wanna hear loud music
Blow my head off, I've got shit on my mind
My unpredictable life makes
Unpredictable rhymes
I'm not a predictable guy
They said I'll get better with time
Get back to my original sound
Big up those who predicted it then
Probably look like the oracle now
See, listen, I'm looking skinny but I feel amazing
I'm only back cause things needed changing
The industry'll be the industry
I'll stay doing me when the game changes
Skin a cat, I found different ways
I was down and out but it's a different day
If we've got different values and principles
Then you better know we're going different ways
Nobody ain't blocking your lane
You might be just stuck in your ways
I'm way up, my set insane

[Hook: Chip & Maverick Sabre]
I've got some shit I need to weigh up, weigh up
Weigh up, weigh up
I took one hit and now I'm way up, way up
Way up
I've got some shit I need to weigh up, weigh up
Weigh up, weigh up, weigh up, weigh up
I took one hit and now I'm way up, way up
Way up, way up, way up, way up, way up

[Break: Chip]
I just wanna hear loud music

[Verse 2: Maverick Sabre]
I've got some shit on my brain so I toke
Smoking and rolling is so high, I fly
We're living and hating ourselves
The window is tinted as well (who's driving by?)
I don't remember what trust is, so
I'm here just weighing up options
I'm sitting here
Smoking, toking, hoping I
Can focus, this moment is rolling by
Even through this walls I'm in
Singing for the ones I've missed
Oh, I
You said "I don't wanna see these clouds, I just want the music loud
I just wanna be on my ones, no lies, no time", oh my, just wind down
And let the rhythm get your mind high

[Hook: Chip & Maverick Sabre]
I've got some shit I need to weigh up, weigh up
Weigh up, weigh up, weigh up, weigh up
I took one hit and now I'm way up, way up
Way up, way up, way up, way up, way up
I've got some shit I need to weigh up, weigh up
Weigh up, weigh up, weigh up, weigh up
I took one hit and now I'm way up, way up
Way up, way up, way up, way up, way up

[Bridge: Maverick Sabre]
I want to take these things off my mind
I want to live, this shit gets me tired
I need to break these chains that they tie
And fly

[Break: Chip]
I just wanna hear loud music

[Hook: Chip & Maverick Sabre]
I've got some shit I need to weigh up, weigh up
Weigh up, weigh up, weigh up, weigh up
I took one hit and now I'm way up, way up
Way up, way up, way up, way up, way up
I've got some shit I need to weigh up, weigh up
Weigh up, weigh up, weigh up, weigh up
I took one hit and now I'm way up, way up
Way up, way up, way up, way up, way up

["Positive"]

[Bridge: Maverick Sabre]
Father, see this life we're living in where so much people cry
Tell me on the TV to be rich so I don't sleep at night
I know there's a change and we can work to see a different life
Give me a sign, a sign, a sign
They think they know me very well
Left here with no one but myself
Watch time pass by
Oh my

[Hook: Maverick Sabre]
Oh, if I don't see nothing positive
How am I supposed to be more than this?
Yeah, I don't need to be safe
I just need to be paid
And oh, if I don't see nothing positive
How am I supposed to be more than this?
I don't need to be safe
I just need to be paid, and oh

[Verse 1: Chip]
Yeah, people dying where I'm from, mothers crying where I'm from
I know people think I'm hiding where I'm from
Paranoid thoughts all the time
I see mothers bury sons, I imagine that was mine
I'm looking at this life like "blud, what has it come to?"
Banging for your manor but fam, what if your mum moved
Somewhere that you didn't know? Maybe to my ends
Then maybe you would have my vision, maybe we'd be friends
Or maybe you won't trust the vision
Take a different path and be the kind of person
That will make me sit here with this pen
You ain't gotta ask me if I'm really from the ends
Diamond from the dirt but now I'm giving you the gems, but it's stress
So I light this last one that I've got
Positive thinking inside a negative box
Due to end up a political nuisance
This is words from an A-grade student, yeah

[Hook: Maverick Sabre]
Oh, if I don't see nothing positive
How am I supposed to be more than this?
Yeah, I don't need to be safe
I just need to be paid
And oh, if I don't see nothing positive
How am I supposed to be more than this?
I don't need to be safe
I just need to be paid, and oh

[Verse 2: Chip]
Yo, most people don't have a pot to piss, yo
Gotta be the shit to make it out the shithole
Remember why you're flipping when you're flipping it though
As fast as it comes, as fast as it goes
I got stuck up for a chain, learnt my lesson for real
I wanted to be Scarface until the end of the film
I guess the money's what they're all having visions about
Things we do to the Queen's head, wish I could â€” in her mouth
In these times today, take my mind away
As I light my grade, I will find a way
I hope and I pray my soul stays the same
As I pass through the hood where they take lives away
The hating ain't new to me, it's usual
And if I die young, man, they'll bang this at my funeral
Good vs evil times, pick a side
And when you do, my brudda, don't be shook to die, yeah

[Hook: Maverick Sabre]
Oh, if I don't see nothing positive
How am I supposed to be more than this?
Yeah, I don't need to be safe
I just need to be paid
And oh, if I don't see nothing positive
How am I supposed to be more than this?
I don't need to be safe
I just need to be paid, and oh

[Bridge: Maverick Sabre]
Father, see this life we're living in where so much people cry
Tell me on the TV to be rich so I don't sleep at night
I know there's a change and we can work to see a different life
Give me a sign, a sign, a sign
They think they know me very well
Left here with no one but myself
Watch time pass by
Oh my
