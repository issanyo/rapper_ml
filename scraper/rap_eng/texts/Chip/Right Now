Just made a banger with SEVAQK

[Chorus: Chip]
Man are trynna get that pound
Touch that town
Gas that crowd
Shut that down
Facts in the booth on a track right now
Me and my niggas on gas right now
Trynna get that pound
Touch that town
Gas that crowd
Shut that down
Facts in the booth on a track right now (Aight)
Me and my niggas on gas right now (Brrrt)

[Verse 1: Chip]
Two eyes on an MC, no fear
Third eye open I still see clear
Drop the flows, drop the quotes still here
Drop your tape, drop your tracks who cares
Last year everybody had a good year
This year, next year, man's still here
Man can’t play me at musical chairs
Tried and tested, I clap who dares
Four fours, that's sixteen do it properly
Four cars, sixteen dawgs, all got me
Convoy with the gang, God still got me
Bare .44 talk, no one shot me
Man's not hot still man wanna hot me
I get on MC’s, bout you're on me
Man wanna send, man don't wanna clash
Look, trust me, the school I'm from, blud it's long

[Chorus: Chip]
Get, get that pound
Touch that town
Gas that crowd
Shut that down
Facts in the booth on a track right now
Me and my niggas on gas right now
Trynna get that pound
Touch that town
Gas that crowd
Shut that down
Facts in the booth on a track right now
Me and my niggas on gas right now
(Serious)

[Verse 2: Jme]
Yeah, man still don't care tho
You can't hear, man will drill those ear holes
Man's not scared, don’t feel no fear no
Been away, but I’m gonna kill this year bro
Feelings clear, man spit facts innit, facts
Man had to adlib it
Lights out in a dance
It's either me or Batman’s batarang back did it
Man's back with it
Spin a man like boss bearings
Spin a man like that fidget
Man chat wicked up on mic
But face to face, nah, it's not that, is it
Got stacks in a safe, got stacks in a bank
Yeah, stack illegal and stack legit
You have to sandwich it
Got bread on both sides
Tell no lie, us man did it

[Chorus: Chip]
Get, get that pound
Touch that town
Gas that crowd
Shut that down
Facts in the booth on a track right now
Me and my niggas on gas right now
Trynna get that pound
Touch that town
Gas that crowd
Shut that down
Facts in the booth on a track right now
Me and my niggas on gas right now (Brrrt)

[Verse 3: Frisco]
Here's what they’re talkin' about
What's good cuzzie, it's north in the house (Oh yeah)
Diss man and there's no talking it out
Fam, how you're gonna talk with a hawk in your mouth (Sky)
Diss Chip, famalam that's risky (Wah)
You're either lean, drunk or tipsy
If you got love for me, say it now
Don't wait till I'm on my deathbed it's a myth, see
How many of these MC's gotta now get buried (How many?)
Many, many, oh so many, the flow so heavy
I slow-mo any
I'm down for the fuckery, I'm oh so ready (Oh yeah)
Dem man carry too much feelings
I came up on some rude boy teachings (Yes)
Try shut man down, man come back around
Always find a way to sneak in, come on

[Chorus: Chip]
Get, get that pound
Touch that town
Gas that crowd
Shut that down
Facts in the booth on a track right now
Me and my niggas on gas right now
Trynna get that pound
Touch that town
Gas that crowd
Shut that down
Facts in the booth on a track right now
Me and my niggas on gas right now (Brrrt)
