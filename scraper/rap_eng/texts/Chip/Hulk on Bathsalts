[Verse 1: Dopehead]
Dopehead, Detroit tiger in the lion's den
And fuck rappers, bitch, I ain't tryna kick it
Rhymes from my mentals got me kickin' instrumentals
If you talkin' zeroes, we can kick it like Jitsu
Jxxky gettin' zooted off fried green tomatoes
All black choppa', call that bitch Django
Try to stay humble, niggas wanna try me
I pray for these rappers, lord don't let me catch a body (Amen)
My flow nasty like cigarettes
And all my bitches baldin' like Mia X
You cash her out, she hit me up next
Got her taking plan B, after morning after sex
Tiger striped vans, super skinny pants
Still in the spot lookin' out for them fans
Fuck these bitches, she suckin' with no hands
Backseat with the choppa, fuck nigga we ain't playin'

[Hook: Chip$]
Watch out. You think a nigga playin'? Watch out
You think this is a game? Watch out
Watch out, homeboy. Watch out, bruh bruh. Watch out, Ayo. Watch out
(x2)

[Verse 2: Dopehead]
Nigga say they gettin' money, but they pockets flat
Gremlins flat line a nigga for a hunnit sack
Dump a rapper in a river for a hunnit racks
Whole clip a nigga, no comin' back
Bitch, smokin' dope with my gremlins nigga
Mix the molly with the Henny like a chemist nigga
Whack it off the sand like a tennis nigga
Bad bitches love Jxxky, king koochie killa
Chasin' paper in the streets, where the money at?
Nigga die in the zone off a dummy pack
My nigga goose got life, he ain't comin' back
RIP Lil B, Guttah, and my nigga Black
Pull up, smoke, back seat full of bitches
Niggas bitchin', bitch, I'm all about my business
Shot's gon' fire, anything look suspicious
And I be fresh as hell if fans takin' pictures, bitch
