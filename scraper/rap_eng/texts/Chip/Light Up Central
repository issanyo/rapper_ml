[Intro: Chip]
Yeah

Dun know, listen, yah, yo

[Verse 1: Chip]
In a soundclash, manna get light up (yah)
So don't amp or hype up (no)
See the circular team? There's nobody like us (no one)
We're Lord of the Mics
Come here witcha hype, don't 'llow ya face fi get light up
Cuh my team stands tall when the mic's up (yeah)
So boy better know, these boys better grow
And on nothin' anybody get light up
Light up, light up, light up, light up
Mr. Munk will dun a man's hype, blud (yah)
If you clash me and pull off a miracle
No lie, Shalo and Hits will rise up
Rise up, rise up, rise up, rise up (rise up)
Cuh my team stand tall to the end
None of them can do how we do with a pen (never them)
In a soundclash, manna get light up
Don't amp or hype up, most will get light up
If you ain't got bars to back talk
Don't try step up, fam, you best walk (best walk)
I'm a Lord of the Mic
Chat shit, I'll put an end to your hype and an end to your MC life
I got bars to dun a man's dance
So don't try come around and try clash no lad
24s will light up your arse

[Verse 2: Black The Ripper]
In my ends, you get light up
Some man try hype up but they get ignored
They just spit 'cause they're bored
Here's my advice: find a man to fife, blud
And don't release any mixtapes
'Cause nobody's payin' a fiver
Hang the mic up, seriously
What you doin' with your life, cuz?
Don't hit the road, you'll get pied up
Or front light your coat, you'll get light up
Like a big spliff wrapped by [?], that's piff
I'm in a league of my own like Chip
So leave me alone, you pricks
I'm fully grown like Fris
And when I switch, it's mental
Welcome to Light Up Central

[Chorus: Chip]
Don't park your car 'round Light Up Central (don't park it)
Cuh you will get light up, mental (yeah)
You clashed man before and trust
We don't lose so it's far from experimental
Don't park your car 'round Light Up Central (don't park it)
Cuh you will get light up, mental (light up)
You clashed man before and trust
We don't lose so it's far from experimental (rah)

[Verse 3: Frisco]
So don't come around Light Up Central (it's true)
Cuh any MCs get light up, mental
Likkle man need some grilling at night time
Still getting guidance from the parental (rah)
Big Fris and Chipmunk light up them fools (yeah)
Go hard with bars, I flow mental
The bars are far from gentle
Big Fris, I can bring life to any instrumental (it's true)
Everything fast that I place, that's mental
I can't stop, that's mental (it's mental)
So there's no point clashing 'em so we can spray this [?] (uh)
What you say? What you chattin', bruv?
I stand firm when the mic's up
Hype up and get light up around Light Up Central
You don't want a [?] performance
And that bottle [?]

[Chorus: Chip]
Don't park your car 'round Light Up Central (don't park it)
Cuh you will get light up, mental (yeah)
You clashed man before and trust
We don't lose so it's far from experimental
Don't park your car 'round Light Up Central (don't park it)
Cuh you will get light up, mental (light up)
You clashed man before and trust
We don't lose so it's far from experimental (rah)
