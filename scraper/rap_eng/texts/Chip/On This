[Hook: Wiley]
Name won't die out
I proved my point at the try-outs
Can't sell things for the wrong price
Wanna own stuff, no buy-outs
Had a flow for the longest
Had bars for the longest
Other dons wonder why they won't last so long
It's 'cause they ain't on this

[Verse 1: Wiley]
I'm on tings, ring my phone, no long ting
Could've been the right or the wrong ting
Make a big song ting, everybody sing-along ting
Hold tight my gang, though, sing-along kings
I bring along kings
They bring along other sing-along kings
I've shown you already what a string of luck brings
Don't matter about your upbringin'
Man are still winnin', on this ting every day though
Songs don't drop everyday, they're gettin' made though
Ain't on the radio much, I'm gettin' played though
No, I ain't new in the game, I'm gettin' paid dough
Top grime dons are the livest
All the fans come through and decide this
History's written, I ain't gotta rewrite it
Man are the elite, bro, we ain't gotta hide it

[Hook: Wiley]
Name won't die out
I proved my point at the try-outs
Can't sell things for the wrong price
Wanna own stuff, no buy-outs
Had a flow for the longest

Other dons wonder why they won't last so long
It's 'cause they ain't on this

[Verse 2: Chip]
RIP jokes ('llow that, 'llow that)
Man can't die out (never)
I book that and fly out (somewhere hot)
I let it boom bye bye out
Tek man for chocolate chip
You can't melt me or deep-fry me ('llow that, 'llow that)
I beg a man don't doubt me
Put lion bars on a bounty
Can't let nuttin' slide, come on guys (come on)
Tell a boy fuck your watch, take your time (come on)
You man forced the wheel, on your bike (come on)
You're bad in your ends, not in mine ('llow it)
You're nice over there, not on grime (come on)
Don't come over here, stay aside (yeah)
Mad ting, over here
Lyrics fly like birds in the sky

[Verse 3: Ice Kid]
Anybody frontin' like you're on top
I'ma dun your hype
Cold like a chunk of ice, undefined
Best stick to your humble pie, you know me, man
I flow deep like when I humbled Ice
Anybody comin' here, better come precise
Quit talkin' a bunch of shite, you're not hard
Man have got bars somethin' like RondoNumbaNine
Feel like I be the greatest to ever
Step foot on the face of the Earth
Got a way with the words, haters wanna rain on my turf
'Til I take 'em away in a hearse
Vacate 'cause you ain't got the nerve or the graveshift
So many things I can state in a verse
Spray words for the cake in your purse
But you man are all broke, it's like you ain't able to work

[Hook: Wiley]
Name won't die out
I proved my point at the try-outs

[Verse 4: Little Dee]
Look, our line of work was linin' work
Now I'm in the game doin' grime with nerds
Said that I'm a diamond in the dirt
But I don't know what a diamond's worth
I was in the big house ridin' bird
Sittin' with Skrigz, Hattie and Church
Real life link up behind the bars
Now I'm back in the lab like Heisenberg
Still spittin' that meth, turn up to a man's set
Givin' it as good as he gets
Wasn't impressed, labels show interest
Still don't wanna invest
Anyone's guess, man said he wanted me dead
I put the piece to a man's chest, then I put him in check
No, I don't indirect
Somethin' that I need to address? I'll be at your address

[Hook: Wiley]
Name won't die out
