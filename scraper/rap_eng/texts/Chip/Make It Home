[Hook]
Don't know if I'll make it back home
Don't know, make, make, make
Don't know if I'll make it back home
Don't know if I'll make it back home

[Verse 1]
Yeah, my generation know the power of my words
Couple threats got me rapping like this here my last verse
I'm like look at what it's come to
Fuck the world, I need to reason with my uncle
Shit, and my father cuh dem man, their heart clean
Sit up talking 'bout life and what it means
See, they in touch with the spirits I can't see
And they tell me they got me by any means
The angels are on my team, I've got a dream so I've got everything
Listen, let me tell you couple tings I never been
I've never been evil, never been bad-minded
My nigga, I don't even wish bad on bad-minded people
Clean-hearted kid, I say it loud, say it proud
Got a talent, never done nothing immoral for a pound
Gave more than I would thieve, always helping people out
Now I'm focusing on me, my good karma's coming round
I've been waiting on it, praying on it, staying up, saving on it
Boy into a fine young man, they know I've got it
Every man for himself on who shall I depend
Judgement day will not be you and your friend
I ghost and focus, get on my dizzy flow
I told Jazz I'll still be rapping when Izzy grow
I'm thinking back to Atlanta, now look how Iggy grown
That booty had me moving nervous in the studio
My fans want an album from me, I need hope first
I left Hustle Gang and came home, I had to soul search
And it's a blessing just to see who's still hollering
I'm on a journey, boy, you hating or you following
I'm preeing life like a chess board
A king should never sell his bishop out for no dead cause
Hibernating, tryna calculate who loves me
It's hard staying positive, the city's full of fuckery

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
If I told you my dream at 14, you'd say I'm crazy
Lived em all out by 21, you have to rate me
Praise be to God, the boy back on his job
Dots, even I forgot who I was
Forgot where I'm from, forgot that I'm loved
Trust me, you'll be surprised what wrong company does
In and out of deals, you wanna see my lawyer bill?
Now I just wanna build my own company, cuz
The foundation is love, and I'm starting with me
Sorry kids, I can't sign you, I'm still working on me
[?] starting again, I've gotta snap with this pen
So if you're rapping I'm your fucking competition, not your friend, it's not the end
But I'm cool, still give a man a hail up
But I ain't tryna page you, I'm just tryna fill this page up
From 17, I had my cake up
Hey 90s babies, you're my age, step your game up
These rappers tryna play [?]
Blow my own trumpet, I could have your girl here too
Switch my number every minute, I don't need these calls
The pressure makes diamonds, I don't need no jewels
Cuh Neo ain't getting caught up in no matrix
I'm starting new chapters, reading old pages
As long as my talent turns over papers
It's gonna be a broke motherfucker hating
Young, fly, cool shit
Smelling like a victor, so miss me with the bullshit
Come on, someone's gotta rap for all these cool kids
I'm still up in my [?] with my dargs I went school with
From growing pains, yeah, I changed loads
But nigga, you ain't know Mrs [?]
I'm still the same old, with your same old
Doing the same old

[Hook]

[Bridge]
You see, the universe is real
If what you give to it, it gives back to you
I'm looking forward to my next five years
Amen
Cuh you know fear kills more dreams than anything
And that's real
London Boy
