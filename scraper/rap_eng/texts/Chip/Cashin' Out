London City I'm from
London City I rep
Take a look at my wrist
Cost an arm and a leg
And we be cashin' out dumb
But we ain't takin' no cheques
I'm riding round and I'm getting it
Tity Boi on my neck
Violate the kid you'll get touched in a minute
Got that Euros account that I ain't touched in a minute
Know my value know my worth I'ma double these figures
On my George W Bush I don't fuck with you niggas
Im with TI in the VI going down we in Mansion
One blunt, one cup, bad bitch on a mad ting'
Hustle Gang we turned up
One time shout big punch to Kane
Most my niggas still move work
Big in country when it comes to cane
Bitch nigga all I do is go
Count G's smoke O's
Holla when you're ready nigga let me know
Sharp thinker with a blunt rolled
Call me young Chip I hold it down
I don't wash the color when I paint the town
Used to run around hustling for a gram
Fuck you I'm Grand Hustle now
Shouts my nigga Effay
Eh Baf we're moving major
I go blind on a beat
But I still see the paper
And I still put my heart in
Many mills later
Like my cheese chunky
Tell a hater fuck a grater
I'm so futuristic probably walk before I crawl
Chip is the name pop up like Lin nigga all I came to do is ball
And you know i've got too much pride to ever let one of you see me fall
Bitch as long as I've got the mic, the writings on the wall
