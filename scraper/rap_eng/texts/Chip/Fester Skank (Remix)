[Verse 1: Lethal Bizzle]
You might see me in a Lambo
Camo snapback, Rambo
500 horses, Django
2 2 chicken, Nando
You might see me in a Rari
Old school fella, Atari
It's a new dance, no tango
Anywhere I go, I make the gang go

[Break: Lethal Bizzle]
Ayy Diztortion, ayy pull that up man
Let's hit 'em with the remix
Dench

[Verse 2: Stormzy]
They salute me on the roads and tell me well done
If I ever told you what your girl done
I can't even tell you what your girl done
Anywhere I go, I let your girl come
Fester
All black, got me looking like I'm Skepta
On the ball, man, I move like Iniesta
Chilling in the lab and feeling like I'm Dexter, work

[Verse 3: Chip]
Anywhere I go, I make the gang go (woo)
Don't call me cuz, we ain't fam though (move)
Clean everyday, Mavado (gully)
2 2 haters, calm though (haha)
I bring the vibe in my verses
Cemetery full of features that I murdered (rah)
It's a new dance, start skanking (vibes)
Chippy on the remix, mad ting

[Hook: Lethal Bizzle]
Fester, fester, fester
Anywhere I go, I make the gang go
Fester, fester, fester
Anywhere I go, I make the gang go

[Verse 4: Fuse ODG]
You might see me in my condo
Chilling with my Gs on a console
But she saying it be me she wanna control
But I'm the king from Africa to Toronto
She wan' swing on me pronto
She knows I am the king in this jungle
It's a new dance like Azonto
Anywhere I go, I make the gang go

[Verse 5: Wretch 32]
You might see me in a Lizzy tee
Porsche got me screwing flat heads in the Phillipines
On point, now she want a Wretch that could stick it in
Ever since she heard I got mills, she want Nicki-Meek
I called her dreamchasing
Tryna stand her ground, make her knees cave in
That ring says she must be married
When I was banging her to Drake, she said "trust mi daddy"
30,000 in the field, that's a fester
Threesome in the field, that's a festival
When she want dumpling, I get a festival
Cuh anywhere I go, I make the gang go, true

[Hook: Lethal Bizzle]
Fester, fester, fester
Anywhere I go, I make the gang go
Fester, fester, fester
Anywhere I go, I make the gang go
