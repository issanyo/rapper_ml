[Intro: Chip]
Yeah
I might just let it run for a bit and then, like, start later, start like now
Now, now, now-now right? Alright, cool, cool

[Verse 1: Chip]
Me and my team the cream of the crop
Me, I'm the cream, my niggas all crop
You man claim that you spit fire
It's not that deep, you're not that hot
It's not that deep, you're not that hot
It's not that deep, you're not that hot

[Verse 2: Konan]
Model in my car
Said she likes the model of my car
I don't love these hoes, I just touch and go
Never let a bitch take me for a puppy show
Should've never gave me a deal
Instant fame, I can make you famous for real
They read magazines, man empty them
I get bags, I'm your girl's #MCM
Yeah, I get birds cause I get bread
With a ginger girl, getting red head
Better get out the caskets
IPhone but I'm still burying artists
I bully nearly everywhere, you ain't never there
Looking for a fuckboi, nah, never here
I smell some hating arse niggas
Tell em try a ting init

[Hook: Chip](x2)
Waiting on, just waiting on my time
Need to brush some of these bitches off of my line
You been laying low, we ain't heard from you in time
Don't worry bout me, don't worry bout me, I'm fine

[Verse 3: Frisco]
Yo Chippy, let me brush them off
The big dog's here, puppies? I'mma hush em off
I'm so Boy Better Know, you and I know
It's a suicide flow and I'm jumping off
It's jumping off when I start dumping off
Big Fris, I'mma wig this, kid, be my witness
Before man try interrupt my settings
Big 45's gonna get him
It's a mad ting anytime I take it out
Don't know why they wanna take me out
Maybe because my ting tun up
And I've got girls lined up like Take Me Out
Rudeboy, I go everywhere, you ain't never there
Looking for an idiot, nah, never there
If cash ain't your motto and you don't play dirty
Boy better leave that shit over there

[Hook: Chip](x2)

[Verse 4: Krept]
Stay up on the grind
Ordered me a Roley, I'm just waiting on my time
Got your wife on the roster
Balls over her head, niggas saying that I lobbed her
You? Got a couple shoes on the rack
Me? Spent a couple racks on the shoes
Us? We'll do a move with Jack
You? You'll get jacked on a move
Young Gs silence on their burners
Catch you in the dance and get Shmurda'd
Hot nigga, this some hot niggas
Red leather jacket, MOBO, man got Thriller
I be nearly everywhere, you ain't never there
Looking for a fuckboi, nah, never there
I smell some hating arse niggas
Suck your mum, init
