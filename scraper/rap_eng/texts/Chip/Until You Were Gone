Oh whoa oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh whoa oh oh oh oh oh oh (C.M)

If I had all the money in the world
I still couldn't buy me a brand new girl I love
Too much clubbing, not enough loving
Too much shopping, too busy chasing this thriller
Who's now took a lost on your winner
Sitting there singing this song like
You never know what you've got 'til it's gone like

[Hook]
Damn, I wish I would've seen it coming
Cause I blink for a second and you caught me slipping, Oh, Oh, Oh
Now we're done before we even started
Didn't know how much I missed you
(Didn't know how much I would miss you
I messed up the perfect picture)
Until You Were Gone, gone, gone [x3]
I didn't know how much I missed you
Oh whoa oh oh oh oh oh oh [x2]

Let me go, Yeah

And look still I'm here
She left me with no idea
I just don't get it, it's kinda weird
How you took off quicker than my career. it's kinda left
It took a wrong man to admit he's wrong
Still can't do it, I just put it in a song
So don't correct me, I know that I'm wrong
(I just need love)
I'm too stuck in my ways
And I know this ain't helping me change
And I'm sitting here singing this song like
You never know what you've got 'til it's gone like

[Hook]

I'm too stressed and I'm trying not to flip
I close my eyes and you're beside my lips
So I try not to blink for one split sec
Cus she bought in, and got my piece wrecked
Since you left, nothing ain't right
Two different ways, we have to part sides
It's a long sighting, y'know, It ain't the same when you went missing
Didn't know how much I missed you until you were gone, gone, gone

Until you were gone, gone, gone [x3]

I didn't know how much I missed you
(Didn't know how much I would miss you
I messed up the perfect picture)

Damn, I wish I would've seen it coming
Cause I blink for a second and you caught me slipping, Oh, Oh, Oh
Now we're done before we even started
I didn't know how much I missed you

Until You Were Gone, gone, gone [x3]
