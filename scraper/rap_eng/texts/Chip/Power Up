[Intro]
But they don't wanna let me in
Alright then
Beast
All glass ceilings will be broken down
Straight like that
Godly path

They don't wanna see me onstage
See a soundboy get blazed
Crowd go sick, insane

They don't wanna see me onstage
See a soundboy get blazed
Man go sick, insane
By now, you know the name

Talk the truth (ayy), they can't stand it (ayy)
Handle spitters (ayy), I don't have it (never)
Come out and spit two bars
See the crowd go mad when I do this (wheel-up sets)
Can't block me for no reason
I've got a big mouth and I'll use it (yeah)
