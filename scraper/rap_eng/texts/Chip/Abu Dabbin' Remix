[Verse 1: Red Cafe]
Yeah, pulled the 'Rari out the lot
Got to spinning in the drop
I was chatting on my iPhone, she was dabbing in my crotch
Spend a ticket on the watch
I've been sipping on the Scotch
I got little shawty hot
Imma slap her on her ass, this ain't Love & Hip-Hop
Come and see me at the top
Go getta, hustler from gutter, ha
Let the guys drink, man 'affi eat, big boys at the supper
I got pretty women skinny-dipping

Splish-splashing, Abu Dhabi dabbing

Let them all feel the buzz, SOS in the place now
But man are talking Abu Dabbin so you know we had to go and bring the shakedown

[Verse 3: Elias Brown]
Put the pedal to the damn floor
Triple digits on the dashboard
Outcha with the gang, gang
Living grand like the Habtoor

I'm in Calamari on a short stay
Diamonds dancing like Beyonce
My habibi being salt bae

[Verse 4: [Niico]
Assalaamu Alaikum, how you feeling?
Walk into the building, dab, I do it saucy

Pretty diamonds when that light shines
Crossing borders, yeah we in and out

And I be dabbing through the city now

[Verse 6: Chip]
Oi Chippy, yeah, these rappers dab in every song
I saw you dab and bust it wrong (You look mad)
I've been cooking up an album in the kitchen with the wand (I got the magic)
Pulled up in Dubai, tryna be high but I can't find any dope (Mad)
She asked me why do I smoke (Jarring)
Shut up bitch, choke (Ooh)
On high grade when I wrote this
Put the beat on and smoked it
Hoes and L's like I'm joking
Living my life like it's golden
With the gang, doing toasting
Dabbing with the sheiks thought I hit my brain, skrting, switching lanes
Abudabbin playing
Really see my face, know how low I lay?
Ordered me a coupe, other day it came (Landed)
Ghost-writers, that's a no dawg
I ghost writers with my own bars
You ghost drive, is that your own car?
Stunt until you bruk' a bone dawg
CM attire I comes in
Told her keep my shirt, I don't cuff links
Wasteman on your IG lusting
It's just me and Ty and twenty buff tings
