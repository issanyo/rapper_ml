[Hook]
We ain't gotta go out to eat
Kick back, I cook food for you
Everyday I'm in the mood for you
You make a bad boy good for you
Faithful, I don't know how to be
But imma' try learn how for you
See I ride through the hood for you
You make a bad boy good for you

[Verse 1]
Yo, studio this evening
Went from heartless, to catching feelings
Mani’s or pedi’s, I’ll get you treatments
Come we hit a spa for the week
Tower long, fresh out the shower
Me and you tugether, thats powers
I want your company for life gyal
Baby, we can start with some hours
I think you
Should be mine to the end of time
Had too many selfish nights
But  you make me wanna' share my life
Cus' I don't wanna be a playa no more
I wanna' try here
Something you can think, that makes you wanna whine
What you sayin', you ain't ready baby, we give it time
I still see it in your eyes

[Hook]
We ain't gotta go out to eat
Kick back, I cook food for you
Everyday I'm in the mood for you
You make a bad boy good for you
Faithful, I don't know how to be
But imma' try learn how for you
See I ride through the hood for you
You make a bad boy good for you

[Verse 2]
Yo, blast from the past tryna creep
You want me wanna' block and delete them
I said its studio this evening
But you should be at mine for my reachin
And we dance and we whine it to cartel
Truth say I took you (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Come baby dance now
No is not the answer
I just wanna' hear ya say (yeah, yeah, yeah)
I know I disappear but forgive me
10 years later, reappear did you miss me?
Single bed in my mums yard, you would lift me
My heart is an iceberg but we got a history
Don't wanna be a playa no more
I wanna' try here
Something you can think, that makes you wanna whine
Baby you ain't ready for me, cool give it time
I still see it in your eyes

[Hook]
We ain't gotta go out to eat
Kick back, I cook food for you
Everyday I'm in the mood for you
You make a bad boy good for you
Faithful, I don't know how to be
But imma' try learn how for you
See I ride through the hood for you
You make a bad boy good for you

[Hook]
We ain't gotta go out to eat
Kick back, I cook food for you
Everyday I'm in the mood for you
You make a bad boy good for you
Faithful, I don't know how to be
But imma' try learn how for you
See I ride through the hood for you
You make a bad boy good for you
