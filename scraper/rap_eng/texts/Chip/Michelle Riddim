[Intro: Yungen Sample]
Obviously Chipmunk made me do it, if I'm honest
I heard his one... it was hard
You know, Chip boy's goes in and then
I was like 'yeah, I'm gonna jump on this, this tune's hard'
When I was in school, Chip was the guy
Do you get what I mean?
So all the girls in my school loved Chipmunk
Thinking rah, I wanna be like this guy
Get my rap, I can... you know what I mean?

[Verse 1]
No more lyrical war
No more lyrical war
Cuh pre-recording don't count
When you do lyrical war (epic fail)
If you don't like me, buss your gun
If you don't like me, suck your mum
If you wanna make it about ends
Cool, come Tottenham, son
Put your 44 in your 4 door
And make that 45 drive
I've got savages who still love me
You'll get BlukuByeBye
I'll pepper your clart and still perform
My verse on "Don't Waste My Time"
You couldn't be on that song over me
Oh please, don't waste my time
The big spittas from Tottenham
Have done things to help your side
Them man get their respect
I'm like "oh where's mine?"
"Go Down South", that helped you shut up
Sneakbo bussed this lighty, shut up
Patrick backup dancing for Clive?
Plucked your style from Kanye, shut up
Go off the rails from now
The word 'lighty', that's for girls from now
If them man are Destiny's Child for you
#Michelle from now (some Nando's rice)
You little soundboy, stay off grime
You ain't got the touch like man
And you've got a deal you can lose
You don't give a fuck like man (unruly)
And she was cool, she weren't wife
But why you gotta tell lies, fam? (you fucking liar)
And when I made her play dirty
She said "you can't fuck like man"
And what's wrong with having a Smart?
I ain't broke, are you having a laugh?
I've got ten bags for the girl
That's got a restraining order on your clart
No girl in my life has ever wanted
Me that far away (oh god)
You're gonna have some hype after this
But me take the L? No way
Oh no, no, no
Big grade spliff, in my zone
Minding my business, handling business
Young and I spray, show, show
I'll let it go, go, go
You was lost on the long way home
Pizza Boy and I've got a delivery
Right for your dome, dome, dome
I said I wouldn't diss you, I know
But preed you sitting on your video
See, the petrol station, that's my ting
Go get some ideas of your own
"Pepper Riddim", no, you're not me
"In2 Remix", no, you're not me
Bigging up my pagans when you do it
Been a snake? That's not me (never)
These days when I wear designer clothes
Logos, don't see them
But I wear Burberry boxers
Batty boy, you probably pree them

[Interlude]
What the fuck, man?
Ahh
Patrick
What you saying, out here now, yeah?
Cool, bro

[Verse 2]
Patrick, what have you done? (oh no)
When I took you on tour
Your mum said "thank you for bringing my son" (my son)
Now I gotta bury her son (damn)
Sorry Mum, had to be done (damn)
Tell him that I'm not the one (damn)
No, tell him that I am the one (yeah)
The Matrix is over and done
The Matrix is over and done
Out your loafers, got spun
Think you're ready so come
Been a snake, been a coon
Been a coward, been a punk (Judas yout)
Can't even come with facts
When they step up and diss me (joke ting, fam)
Last time I took five bills for a show
You fool, I was fifteen
Now ask yourself
What was you doing then, blud?
Grime scene saviour, rudeboy
(I wear my own garms)
(Man see me on road and want arms)

Preeing my life just like everybody else
And that's all you've got?
When are you niggas gonna learn, blud?
I changed the weather in the whole country
Number one's all good and that, but
Man's in the petrol station with you now
So everything I said in my Fire in the Booth was fucking true
And the truth hurts, init?
That's why you niggas don't like me, blud
Cash Motto for life
North London, I represent you to the end
Yeah?
Powers, forces, spirits
Free Mario, yeah
Man's sold millions of records with Sony, you know
You ain't done jack shit yet
Jumping out of his fucking pram
