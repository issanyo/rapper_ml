[Pre-Chorus: Pixie Lott & VV Brown]
When there's nowhere else to run
Is there room for one more son, one more son
If you just hold on, if you just hold on
Hold on

[Chorus: All]
I got soul but I'm not a soldier
I got soul but I'm not a soldier
I got soul but I'm not a soldier
I got soul but I'm not a soldier

[Verse 2: Bashy]
From peace in the world, I'm a big supporter
All these kids wanna drink his water
But the conflict destroys the bricks and mortar
See pain in their eyes I can feel the torcher

[Pre-Chorus: Frankmusik & Tulisa (N-Dubz)]
When there's nowhere else to run
Is there room for one more son, one more son
If you just hold on, if you just on hold on, hold on

[Chorus: All]
I got soul but I'm not a soldier
I got soul but I'm not a soldier
I got soul but I'm not a soldier
I got soul but I'm not a soldier

[Verse 3: Ironik]
Listen, you got no love 'cause you never received it
And that's 'cause you never did teach it
Preach this, lets the kids go
'Cause love is a potion trapped in a soul

[Pre-Chorus: McLean, Mpho & Egypt]
When you think your battles are won
Then you find it's left undone, left undone
If you can't hold on, if you can't hold on
Hold on

[Chorus: All]
I got soul but I'm not a soldier
I got soul but I'm not a soldier
I got soul but I'm not a soldier
I got soul but I'm not a soldier

[Verse 4: Chipmunk & Dappy (N-Dubz), Both]
See me I'm the type that will die for a cause
But no kids will die for a war
Let fight for a cause, pray for a better days
When going gets tough there's a better way
Fasze you now you been there when there's a better days
Normal pain my life's gotta better page
And no kid should die for a war
I will fight in the eyes of the lord

[Chorus: All]
I got soul but I'm not a soldier
I got soul but I'm not a soldier
I got soul but I'm not a soldier
I got soul but I'm not a soldier

[Verse 4: Tinchy Stryder]
Let them breath in air don't chock them
I got souls so my heart stays open
Stop the wars let the kids incorpen
I seen light look over the ocean

I'm not a solider
Yea yea yea yea

[Bridge: All, Frankmusik & Dappy]
Yeah you now you gotta help me out
Yeah oh don't you put me on the back burn no
You now you gotta help me out yeah
You gonna bring yourself down
Over and in, let us call for sin
Where everyone loves the battle is one
With all these things that I have done

[Chorus: All]
I got soul but I'm not a soldier
I got soul but I'm not a soldier
I got soul but I'm not a soldier
I got soul but I'm not a soldier
