It makes it easier, easier to bear
(Yeah Mr Wretch

You won't be regret it, no, no, no
Some girls, they don't forget it
Love is their whole happiness
(Just to make you smile.)

Squee, Squee, squeeze her, don't tease her, never leave her

(Wretch 32)
Ahh yeah
I got that forever grin
See I ain't even settling for everything
Yeah, I used to wanna piece of mind
Haha, now I guess I want the rest of it
Chilling with Chip
Talking bout acres
Move into the trees
While I accumulate papers
Vegetary on the fax
Accountant on the tax
Ain't allowed to make it rain co’ I drown it in the catch

(Chipmunk)
I used to hate Christmas
Now I’m living merry
She don’t like fruits but wants in on my berry
I don’t run from my bills, Ive been doing my thing
The only red letters I ever see is ping
Too much stress can come from one pen
The ends is in me even though I'm out the ends
And understand that every story has an end
Im trying to marry miley, divorce her and never write again

(Wretch 32)
Aaaamen
God bless we
My flash kicks gave the devil epilepsy
I be the number 1 enemy of jealousy
I let them bitch, they ain't in my pedigree!
See even when I was a little woofer
I was crawling on the curb like I was looking for a hooker
I am for early, I never be late
Was the first to get head but the last to get face

(Chipmunk)
Pedicure toes
LV Slippers
In this white mans world I done well for a nigga!
Wretch made punctuation I told him dont bother
Ca’ were here now every figure has a comma
Full stop
Were still a stand in a restaurant yamming some shit we can't pronounce
Still in the hood they can never run me out
We’re those same niggers trying to move that B off a bounce

(Wretch 32)
Ouch, I don’t feel pain
Had my heart broke when I was young
How I’m still vain
Remains a mystery as strange as Lil B
In the air so much, a plane's a crib to me
Always got a whole stairs
Been hot since 97, guess they wanna Funk Flex
It's not that I’m a legend only cos I am not dead
Feels like I'm in heaven, they tell me I'm god blessed

(Chipmunk)
Ayy Wretch, sipping champagne on a plane
I was underground around the time they blew up all them trains
Lines we make up still carry the game
We only built the foundations just to rub it in your face
Cover your blemishes
If you ain't siding your nemesis
You born losers will never win
Fuck you all, the calibres just ain't the same
There's 2 seats in the back and nigga, you ain't in the range!
