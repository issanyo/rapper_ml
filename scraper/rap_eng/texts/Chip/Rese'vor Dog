[Verse 1: DopeHead]
Mask on my face like Nacho Libre
Grand Theft Auto, call me CJ
Clothes on my body, cash in the brief case
Pull up your pants, dog, this shit is so cliche
Platinum flight pods is copped off Eastbay
I don't give a damn what she or he say
Niggas always stuck on he say she say
The game getting nasty out there, nigga, be safe
Money make it hard for young hoes to keep faith
You niggas live envy, smoke trash, and sleep hate
Y'all ain't balling, you're cheapskates
Listen, I'll show you what the value of a dollar mean
Time for me to throw the mask on like it's Halloween
You ain't got a lot of fiends, you just got a lot of dreams
With beef, then cop them things it's not a thing
Shots is spring like bada boom bada bing

[Verse 2: Danny Brown]
D Brown, pump like Reebok
Y'all niggas bums, y'all pump that sheet rock
Y'all too ugly, Rocksteady and Bebop
Me- I smoke it look like a peacock
Your girl a hoe, she drank my semen
All cause I told her I'll take her to Eastland
Bitch nigga jump, get cracked like a pecan
Brown too dazed nigga this where the weak end
Eight 16's, skipping school up in Prestige
Y'all niggas soft like a batch of wet leaves
Brown town mix that Nestle
Brown been copping since (SS Creskey?)
Nigga don't test me, blow your shit out
Matter of fact, I shoot- Call me Danny Dick Out
Nigga I back out, spit till the finish
Have a nigga look like Reggie Dennis

[Verse 3: Chip$]
I ain't gangsta, I ain't never been in a gang
Plus I'm too fresh, rocking bandanas is lame
I ain't a hustla, that's trying to box me in
I mean I hustle but who don't? If you not, you tripping
And you? You ain't dope enough
The 50 Caliber will crack your whole coconut
Uh no milk, just the cherry filling
Shoot a hater in the head, yeah it's very thrilling
I'm in a European car, panoramic ceiling
Staring at the sun, through the transition
I ain't kill that man, nor did my man shoot him
We put bullets in the air, that silly nigga ran into em
I leave your forehead translucent
I leave your rib cage transparent
When I'm hopping out that van shooting
Kill you on film and mail it to your grandparents
