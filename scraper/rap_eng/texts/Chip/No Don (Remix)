[Verse 1: Lucas]
Ring ring, since I’m getting money I’m the in thing
Bling bling, diamonds on my Rolly got me squinting
Six figure nigga I’m balling I call it dribbling
Imma put on all of my brothers, word to my siblings
Wait. If you’re getting money let me hear you shout pace!
Im the type of nigga take your missus on a date
Thought it was a rental when they seen a new plate
Screaming ‘Lotto to the world’ there ain't nothing to debate

[Hook: Ash]
You ain't making money like we
No don, no don, no don, no don, no don
You ain't making money like we
No don, no don, no don, no don, no don
You ain't making money like we
No don, no don, no don, no don, no don
You ain't making money like we
You ain't making money like we
No don, no don

[Verse 2: Chip]
Yea
What’s your favourite colour’ let me think G
I got a thing for pinkies
Never been red eye, I ain't preeing what you're stacking
When I was first rocking chains half you niggas weren’t rapping
Cruising through the city with an O on me, in an Addison Lee and I got Notes on me
And you were popping that was me, now I’m a young OG
Shorty Swing My Way, K.P. and Envyi
Ay yaya hehe
Red leathers in the coupe, wanna slide with me?
Hit the Caribbean, take a flight with me
Won’t cost you a penny spending time with me, see
Ay yaya hehe
When you’re making money make a Nigga wan pree
Started with a fiver, never had a lyca
How you make your money man, I’m just an MC

[Pre-Hook: Ash]
Everybody wanna swing my way
'Cos they heard I got a banger
I used to call up Lexi, Alisha and Paige
And they never used to answer
And now they wanna roll with a squad like mine
Oh follow nah nah nah
And now they wanna phone up my main line
Oh follow nah nah nah

[Hook: Ash]
You ain't making money like we
No don, no don, no don, no don, no don
You ain't making money like we
No don, no don, no don, no don, no don
You ain't making money like we
No don, no don, no don, no don, no don
You ain't making money like we
You ain't making money like...

[Verse 3: Ash]
I have some new riddims, new lyrics
Some finished, abusing it
Im bruising it, amusing it
But Ive only been in the game for two minutes
Peng ting called Madison
You just need to hop out the Addison Lee
And we could spend nights up in Raddison
That's not my bae man, that's my G, G

[Verse 4: Not3s]
What you sayin? Broke boy what you sayin?
You got old money that’s Nando
I’m peri-tay mar, youre plain
Chicken, I’m winning
Snooze now, you losing
And couple Niggas always wanna try it
Didn’t she really know we got the ting

[Pre-Hook: Ash]
Everybody wanna swing my way
'Cos they heard I got a banger
I used to call up Lexi, Alisha and Paige
And they never used to answer
And now they wanna roll with a squad like mine
Oh follow nah nah nah
And now they wanna phone up my main line
Oh follow nah nah nah

[Hook: Ash]
You ain't making money like we
No don, no don, no don, no don, no don
You ain't making money like we
No don, no don, no don, no don, no don
You ain't making money like we
No don, no don, no don, no don, no don
You ain't making money like we
You ain't making money like we
No don, no don
