[Intro]
Hard food
Ackee and saltfish, dumpling, plantain, dem tings
Yeah
Lava flows
Pepper
Yeah

[Verse]
Never had a clash in your life
Now you wanna talk all rough
That junk should've been free
That junk cost too much
Now you wanna work with the underground
The same niggas that you dissed, fam
I'll teach you about junk food
One time, pen up a Big Mac
Next time you're with your parliament friends
Tell 'em don't bomb Syria
Aim your pen for the pop chart
Don't pen in my area
About RT this, I'll get at him
Do a song on your own while you're at it
Nobody get involved, don't back him
Stand back while I back to back clap him
Why did you tweet that you hope
The mandem get free Yeezys for
Coming out of the BRITs?
Blud, you're gassed, out of your wits
Did you bring anyone out of the BRITs?
No, so shut up, hold your lips
Oi, you don't get it, my bars live forever
And your Twitter fingers are getting you peppered
Oi Patty, I'm not done with you
Man dissed me for working with Breezy
But went off and made songs with you
And who's more pop, fam, him or you?
Who's more pop, fam? Me or you?
Hypocrites, you pricks, you know it's true
Friends I've lost, yeah, fuck 'em too
Niggas don't like me cuh I'm the truth
I'll pepper old niggas
I'll pepper new niggas, I'll pepper you niggas
Link up and make tune niggas
Cuh you don't know what to do niggas, who are you niggas?
To me and my pen, no one
Helping hand from who? No one
I said winter will be a cold one
Both got number ones but hold one
It's just me on my Jack Jones
But I'm still going so hard (repping)
Bought my own jewels, bought my own yard
Wear my own garms (big man ting)
The best ting man do
Bluku bye bye, move (come out my way)
Cuh the best talk gets awks
When I'm in the room (walahi akh)
Can't play me with words
Got wordplay too
I don't do red devils
But I can outman you
You think you got jokes?
I'm on a joke ting too
Oi, I've got the powers in me
That'll bring out the coward in you
I don't wanna sit down and chat though
I'll fling on a track though
You've got biceps and triceps
And abs but got no backbone
Don't know who you're getting at with cane rows
But I know I've got tats though
For the bars ting, you ain't last
But you still gotta get to the back, bro

[Outro]
Cuh trust me, that Junk Food for £5.99, I don't know about all that
Trust me, rather buy Chick-King two-piece
Mad
Cuh trust me, that Junk Food for £5.99, I don't know about all that
Trust me, rather buy Chick King two-piece
Dun know
You know what I mean? With the coleslaw on the side
You get me?
I beg man just start missing me with it, me, please
Cuh trust me, you can download this one bro, this tape here for free of charge
Like a tutorial on how to be a barrers
That's shit money can't buy, man
You know what I mean?
Motto gang
