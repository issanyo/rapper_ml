You claim I used all my strikes
Yet you don't neglect my vibe
If we only get one life
We should have one more try
Don't be foolish
Girl i'm only human (Human yeah)
If we only get one life
We should have one more try

[Verse 1: Chip]
The sunshine reminds me of your face
(Your face, your face, your face)
You come round you brighten up my day
(My day, my day, my day)
There's girls around me but they can never be bae
(They could never ever be bae)
Baby let me tell you sumtin'
They don't mean nutin'
They don't mean nothing

[Verse 3: Kranium]
Ooh yea
If I could I would
Even though I should
Remove all these problems
That is causing pain
And we reach too far now
To retract these lanes
And i'm only human
Don't drive me insane
Come down down down
You give what you get
I never turn my back on you not yet but i
Can't bother with this back and forth
Feel like me stuck in a court
Please make your choice
Let's live our life

[Hook: Chip]
You claim I used all my strikes
Yet you don't neglect my vibe
If we only get one life
We should have one more try
Don't be foolish
Girl i'm only human (Human yeah)
If we only get one life
We should have one more try
Don't be foolish
Girl i'm only human (Human yeah)
Don't be foolish
Girl i'm only human (Human yeah)
