[Hook]
I know you man just might run out of bars
Chip can’t run out of bars
I get lean, I get waved, get burse
Pull up, I tun up the dance
I know you man just might run out of bars
Chip can’t run out of bars
I get lean, I get waved, get burse
Pull up, I tun up the dance

[Verse 1]
Yeah, can’t fuck with the vibe that the mandem’s bringing
Treat the weekday like a weekend, that’s winning
I don’t bred nobody cuh I know my vision
So if you don’t wanna hear me, you ain’t gotta listen, nigga
I keep getting stabbed in my back, but I’m still swagging on tracks
Dem man bounced off me but I preed it and bounced right back
And when I say I can’t run out of bars, everybody gets gassed
Cuh when I say I can’t run out of bars, they all know it’s all facts like

[Hook]
I know you man just might run out of bars
Chip can’t run out of bars
I get lean, I get waved, get burse
Pull up, I tun up the dance
I know you man just might run out of bars
Chip can’t run out of bars
I get lean, I get waved, get burse
Pull up, I tun up the dance

[Verse 2]
Said I won’t run out, I weren’t lying
Wheel-up bar of the year without trying
Tottenham in me, yeah, I’m riot
Eat MCs alive, fuck a diet
And choong girls love flexing round me
It makes bare man vexed around me
Made the UK super lively
Can’t be dead, no, it’s dead without me
Turntable days, put in hours
Turning tables, now I’ve got powers
Pick man apart in minutes
Shoot and upload in hours
You see me, I do the damage
I had to get a little savage
Out of control, can’t be managed
Whenever I’m dropping, they panic
I’ll pick an MC and upset one
You know, live right there on a set ones
I’m not on one, I’m on a next one
Anyone dissing, wheel-ups, can’t get one
So tun up the sound
Who turned their back on me? Turn back around
Too tun up, I can’t turn down
Want a zoot and a drink right now like

[Hook]
I know you man just might run out of bars
Chip can’t run out of bars
I get lean, I get waved, get burse
Pull up, I tun up the dance
I know you man just might run out of bars
Chip can’t run out of bars
I get lean, I get waved, get burse
Pull up, I tun up the dance

[Verse 3]
Yo, I am the grime scene saviour, Eskimo raver
Man’s still around all ten years later
North London geezer, Loughton Town creeper
Work, and the hard times get easier
These soundboys ain’t got no flavour
Give them pepper, indie or major
Tell a man that wants to rain on me
That lightning can strike back six months later
Going on colder, wiser and older
Laughing after who thought I was over
Strap talk, ‘llow that, pen up revolvers
I put the Chip back on everyone’s shoulder
Don’t like sober, I am a stoner
Watered down? What? Man already crossed over
Feature verse tearer, North Face wearer
Cash Motto, it’s a brand new era

[Hook]
I know you man just might run out of bars
Chip can’t run out of bars
I get lean, I get waved, get burse
Pull up, I tun up the dance
I know you man just might run out of bars
Chip can’t run out of bars
I get lean, I get waved, get burse
Pull up, I tun up the dance
