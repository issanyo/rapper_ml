Cowboy cowboy
Riding in a rodeo
Can I be the one for you
Cowboy cowboy
Your my little romeo
Let me be your cowgirl to

When I see you
Shiffer and Shake
I wanna be the one for you
Your me hero but not on a horse
Let me be the one for you

And everytime I'm looking to you
I'm hoping you will look at me to
And everytime I'm dreaming of you
I'm hoping that my dream will come true

Cowboy cowboy
Riding in a rodeo
Can I be the one for you
Cowboy cowboy
Your my little romeo
Let me be your cowgirl to

When the sunset the prerry on fire
Will you be the one for me
Blood is burning, you light up my eye
You can be the one for me

And everytime I'm seeing your smile
You make me wanne smile at you to
And everytime my heart goes wild
I'm hoping that my dream will come true

Cowboy cowboy
Riding in a rodeo
Can I be the one for you
Cowboy cowboy
Your my little romeo
Let me be your cowgirl to
