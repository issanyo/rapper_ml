[Hook: Little Simz]
Oh, finish starters all day
King of hearts, we don't play
I will show no remorse
If you bring that traitor my way
If you're crossing my land
Better understand you ain't safe
King of hearts, we don't play
King of hearts, we don't play

[Verse 1: Chip]
Flow's on thunder, man
Fuck it, light up a thunder pack
Took the CH off Chip and I put it on Alice
Hit the chalice, now I'm in wonderland
Life's just a gamble, darg
52 deck of cards, I'm the king of hearts
Two bars, I could start the party
24, I could done your dance
So wah da bumba ras?
These bars off to a crazy start, mm
Mad with it, yeah, I'm crazy, darg, mm
Why you mad? I'm just playin' my part, mm
Switch numbers on niggas, they be gettin', no dial
They know a nigga goes in when I zones out
You want a verse? Sorry, no reception
But you know I got Simz like a mobile
I get gassy and boundaries brake
That's why we break the rules in the game
Know yourself, know your place
Know your history, stay in your lane (likkle man)
Live by old school code from day
Don't fuck with everybody 'cuh that's how you get AIDS (mad ting)
You see an MC, I see a hoe
I done took off more heads than Henry the Eighth

[Verse 2: Little Simz]
I done took off all heads, have 'em served on a plate
When you address me, its your grace or I can have you meet your grave
I see you wanna be on a shy ting
Ducking and diving, come out of hiding and show your face
I had to call upon the greats to off niggas in a heartbeat
Hardly, even begun a proceedings of the party
They say "how this girl be running shit? Nah it can't be"
Nobody here can control or demand me
Off niggas then holiday in Bali
I been building and now look what I made
Ain't it amazing and now niggas wanna invade
Are you 'dey craze?
Pardon me, can't be chiefed
Young but a part of me's older
See, had a milli' on my mind since Tha Carter III
Kill 'em but remain kind, where my heart should be
What

[Hook: Little Simz]
Oh, finish starters all day
King of hearts, we don't play
I will show no remorse
If you bring that traitor my way
If you're crossing my land
Better understand you ain't safe
King of hearts, we don't play
King of hearts, we don't play

[Bridge: Little Simz]
Ooh, look at me go
Everything stops when you look at me go
Old rappers need to quit talk about legacy
I don't give a fuck about what he or she sold
Switch, might just bag your bitch
Got bodies in bags and shit
Better tread carefully and I mean that shit
You could, you could fuck around and get smoked, woah

[Verse 3: Ghetts]
I am not to be played with
Bully in any playground that I played in
Eat MCs, knife, fork and plate 'em
You don't wanna know what I'm contemplatin'
Kill 'em all
Direct or subliminal
Over there is where?
I direct my subliminals
Who should I send for?
I ain't gotta say no name
I am so descriptive with it
The fans and critics all know who it's meant for
Kill a student and his mentor
I said peace but I meant war
I said sweet but I meant corn
I said ski but I meant board
You MCs never went school
Basic brains on empty, this is petrol
Nah, this is jet fuel
Nah, this is Ghetts' fuel
Nah, this is mental
Where's the Magnum? It's essential
You're alright, potential
I'm sure tonight will be eventful
But stay away with your morning breath, it's menthol

[Hook: Little Simz]
Oh, finish starters all day
King of hearts, we don't play
I will show no remorse
If you bring that traitor my way
If you're crossing my land
Better understand you ain't safe
King of hearts, we don't play
King of hearts, we don't play

[Bridge: Little Simz]
Ooh, look at me go
Everything stops when you look at me go
Old rappers need to quit talk about legacy
I don't give a fuck about what he or she sold
Switch, might just bag your bitch
Got bodies in bags and shit

You could, you could fuck around and get smoked, woah
