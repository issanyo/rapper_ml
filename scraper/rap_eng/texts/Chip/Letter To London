[Intro]

[Verse 1]
It's do or die
I'm screaming do
Sometimes I lie to women, but I am the truth
Tell money count me in, haters count me out
If I ain't top 5 you're either dumb or can't count
A blind man could see I'm on some neck shit
See that deal he just signed I rejected
Defensive, be offended
I'm just such a trendsetter
Plus I think a little bigger
Hence I do a little better
I get cake like it's my birthday
Cheating on my vocab, that's what you call wordplay
To move Stateside, mmm, yeah I'll take a hundred
I'll come back, make a hundred, I'm just keeping it one hundred
You're too busy calculating what my flaws is
If money makes the world go round, you niggas paused it
Critically criticized you couldn't do better
Call me big headed, but I fit this new era
Real G's respect my hustle, let's keep it real G
If you ain't happy for me now you never will be
Now you've heard my mistakes don't make the same ones twice
The best advice that I can give, is don't take advice
Cause they will steer you wrong, to interrupt your drive
Put a spanner in your works before you reach your prime
Everyone that ever shot me down for not making grime is now
Not making grime, I'm just ahead of my time
But I still got the flow, grounded
Fly as fuck, but still grounded
Can't stuck to one genre, switch styles like outfits
Bad luck like 3 sixes
Pussy nigga your locked up
Penthouse suit, your girl, sex in the air, we fucked up
Sativa for my bretha, swish a roll of that reefa
Them boy there don't fuck with us, we don't fuck with them either
Grand Hustle my team strong, my team's on, what's your team on?
Cash motto- two words, cruel start and I'll move first
Move first, step in the way get moved first
Diss me, no treatment, directors will shoot first
Shoot first, Hustle Gang we on one
Fuck you, sprinting quick, I can't see you in the long run
I'm on Ciroc! I'm on tequila
I'm so UK, Call me Ribena
Pack my bags and hit the A, yeah I put my heart in
If I don't crack the states fly me home in a casket!

[Outro]
