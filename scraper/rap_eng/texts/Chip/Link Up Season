[Verse 1: Chip]
Man don't know about Chippy though
From North, yeah, I grew up on the Risky Roadz
Bun all the iceberg history though
Dem man's history's a mystery though
Man get lost and try send shots
Nah fam, miss me with your miss me flows
Diss me? No, that's risky, bro
Round here there's no frisky flows
Yeah, I pepper anytime, pepper anyone
Pepper, what's your name? Pepper, mi no care (dead!)
You man forgot who's colder
That's why I'm back now and everybody showed up
And still couldn't give a rocks if you're older
I'll take you, your gyal and over
Fake MCs wanna diss me, I hate them
Hungry, trust me, I also hate them

[Verse 2: Swiss]
I'm like test SL, that's a no-no, no-no
We set the blueprint though, that's oh no
Been doing this since 2-0-0-0
I'm feeling myself, no homo
And I'm a stick like the man on the polo
Girls go down on your boy like yo-yo
No strings attached, I'm like YOLO
And I still snap on the track, no photo
Snap, if you boys get me vexed
I'll snap, I might just break your back
Like snap, I might just break a neck
Like snap, I'm like snap, snap, snap
G, stop acting a fool
I've been had platinum plaques on the wall
Brand new fresh Air Max on a walk
And I'm in the hood like tags on the wall

[Verse 3: Black The Ripper]
Why do these man kiss arse?
I'm in the garden watering plants
Fuck you and your shit bars
I'm chilling, billing a big spliff in France
I don't need no introduction
I'm better than all these guys you give suction
Anybody disagrees? Fuck them
I'm just smoking my trees and hustling
Trust me, I'm on this reckless ting
And I will be until my necklace blings
Holla at your nigga Black The Ripper
Everyone knows I rep this ting
Smoke my weed in front of police
You know me, I disrespect the ting
See me in my Dank of England tee
One joint will lick off your headtop clean

[Verse 4: Flowdan]
I'm the farrda but never been gassed up
I lean off any riddim I squeeze on
From day one, I've been the wickedest ting
Dem man there can't prove me wrong
Man light up a verse, man write up a song
I get mad and start put shots first in a song
I learnt from the dons of the 90s, so they couldn't try me
I put them in a hearse on a song
Yeah, and now I'm an original don
In grime, E3's where the originals are from
When war a get wicked, hit them for six like cricket
I know man there long time
Dead that, dog dem never waste time
Fix tings, quick ting, yeah, a couple car fines
Dem man are gonna bred and violate my status?
Presidential from long time

[Verse 5: Rocks Foe]
Foe
Send shots on the sly, tell a man any time of the day
Cut a man short with a clip of the bar then I line up the fade
Don't raise up your tone, don't stretch on your dynamic range
GOD with the flow, man know when I'm live in the place
Live in my space, in my zone
Live in your face, in your dome
You lie in, I'm awake from the go
You lying in the main, it's a show
Three lies, I'm taking her home
Crack and go, should come back to back with the Foe
Make a man know that I don't play
Catch a rapper lacking then I go straight
Make a man run out, best roll safe

[Verse 6: Durrty Goodz]
DG was born in [?]
With marvellous bars and fatherless flows
My 16s are hard as elbows
I'm Haagen-Daaz cold, who are you? What are those?
Don't mek me pull it, bullet
I'll give a man new shell toes
I'm as rude as Gullit, bullet
For them man what sell their souls
It's clapped 'em, clapped 'em to Clapham
Make it clap like I'm a Busta anthem, clap
Clap for them, they can't clap to me rapping
Round of applause cuh this is a wrap
Wrap them up like they've all got it twisted
No, I won't send, I will do the business
I'll take out your top 10 listed
And circle your ends like Chinese whispers
