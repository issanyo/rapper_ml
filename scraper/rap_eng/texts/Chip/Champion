[Intro: Chris Brown & Chipmunk]
Some people have to learn
Some people wait their turn
Some people have to fight, yeah
Some people give their lives, oh (Yeah)

[Verse 1: Chipmunk]
They wanna hold you back, tell 'em pee off
Whenever they say you can't, take the T off
I remember when they told me I wouldn't be famous
Now my dream and reality's simultaneous
And work your own way to the top
If they put you on a pedestal, they can take you off
And there's a higher level than the top
You gotta make more, don't make do with what you got
Yeah, so and get it in, sonny
Not everybody gets a second chance at gettin' money
Or even gettin' lucky
So you gotta feel the hunger in your tummy

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown, Chipmunk & Both]
I'm always pushing myself to the limit, making sure I stay ahead (That's right)
You made me who I am, from the words you said (Yeah)

[Chorus: Chris Brown & Chipmunk]
Some people have to learn (Aha, yeah)
Some people wait their turn (Aha, uh)
Some people but not me, yeah, oh
I was born a champion (That's right)
Some people have to fight (Aha)
Some people give their lives (Aha)
Some people don't believe, woah, oh
But I was born a champion (Yeah)
But I was born a champion (Yeah, yeah)
But I was born a champion

[Verse 2: Chris Brown]
Uh, this gon' be the realest shit I ever wrote
Off the records, no cameras, forget a quote
Some of my family doin' good, most doin' dope
I'm from Virginia where they hang them niggas by a rope
I used to see my momma gettin' beat down
Is that the real definition of me now?
I fell off, back on my feet now
Headed to the sky, can't even see down
Award shows, I pour my heart out
And people still steady tryna point my flaws out
And I'd be lyin' if I say it ain't get to me
But I'm a champion, legend, history

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown, Chipmunk & Both]
I'm always pushing myself to the limit, making sure I stay ahead (That's right)
You made me who I am, from the words you said (Yeah)

[Chorus: Chris Brown & Chipmunk]
Some people have to learn (Aha, yeah)
Some people wait their turn (Aha, uh)
Some people but not me, yeah, oh
I was born a champion (That's right)
Some people have to fight (Aha)
Some people give their lives (Aha)
Some people don't believe, woah, oh
But I was born a champion (Yeah)
But I was born a champion (Yeah, yeah)
But I was born a champion

[Verse 3: Chipmunk, Chris Brown & Both]
Okay, no one wants to help, I guess you're on your own
Build a foundation with the bricks they throw
In a black and white world, true colours show
Change if you want, everybody grows
And life's like an eel, but try and get a hold
Opinions ain't facts, take 'em in and let 'em go (That's right)
You made me who I am, from the words you said (Yeah)

[Chorus: Chris Brown & Chipmunk]
Some people have to learn (Aha, woah-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
Some people wait their turn (Aha)
Some people but not me, yeah, oh
I was born a champion (Champion, ooh, that's right)
Some people have to fight (Aha, woo!)
Some people give their lives (Aha)
Some people don't believe
But I was born a champion (I was, I was, yeah)
Some people have to learn (Ahah)
Some people wait their turn (Aha)
Some people but not me, yeah, oh
I was born a champion
Some people have to fight (Aha)
Some people give their lives (Aha, give their lives)
Some people don't believe, woah, oh
But I was born a champion

[Outro: Chris Brown & Chipmunk]
Champion (Yeah)
But I was born a champion, woah, oh
Champion (Yeah)
But I was born a champion
