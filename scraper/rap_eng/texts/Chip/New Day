[Intro]
Yeah
Cash Motto inside
Ayo Maniac
Still a maniac, yeah

[Hook]
New day, new goals
New niggas chatting shit, how it goes
New day, new flows
Ex girl chatting shit, let me go
New day, new clothes
Garms? Dun know, I wear my own
I wear my own garms, man are old school like this sound
I ain't new to these roads
New day, new goals
New niggas chatting shit, how it goes
New day, new flows
Ex girl chatting shit, let me go
New day, new clothes
Garms? Dun know, I wear my own
I wear my own garms, man are old school like this sound
I ain't new to these roads

[Verse 1]
London Town, what's it all about?
Spitters, gats, shanks all about
Rappers, trappers, slangers all about
Pray that all my niggas make it out
I don't always do it by the book
It's Cash Motto, motto: cash we count
What you spend don't affect my pocket
So I ain't watching what's in your account
Niggas wanna take me out, I know
But the way that me and God are set, it's mad
Christian but do not cross the path
Harlem shook the devil off my back
I'm a little different to these niggas
I'd rather buss a rap than buss a gat
Gift of the motherfucking gab
Inner-city London living's mad

[Hook]
New day, new goals
New niggas chatting shit, how it goes
New day, new flows
Ex girl chatting shit, let me go
New day, new clothes
Garms? Dun know, I wear my own
I wear my own garms, man are old school like this sound
I ain't new to these roads
New day, new goals
New niggas chatting shit, how it goes
New day, new flows
Ex girl chatting shit, let me go
New day, new clothes
Garms? Dun know, I wear my own
I wear my own garms, man are old school like this sound
I ain't new to these roads

[Verse 2]
Hey, where you going? Let me see
What's your vision? Who you tryna be?
Niggas got me feeling like a goal cuh
Niggas wanna shoot and aim for me
Fire alie, I still blaze the beat
Skipped uni, my pen for degree
From KiDULTHOOD to AdULTHOOD to BrOTHERHOOD
You can see the growth in me
But I can see you, you can see me
You're just gassed, you know, Crazy T
I don't like the internet, cuz
My laptop's got internet bugs
Niggas ain't been through what I had to go through
17 in my own yard on my own two
21, I fucked off, back now, fuck you
25 now, I still stand on my own two

[Hook]
New day, new goals
New niggas chatting shit, how it goes
New day, new flows
Ex girl chatting shit, let me go
New day, new clothes
Garms? Dun know, I wear my own
I wear my own garms, man are old school like this sound
I ain't new to these roads
New day, new goals
New niggas chatting shit, how it goes
New day, new flows
Ex girl chatting shit, let me go
New day, new clothes
Garms? Dun know, I wear my own
I wear my own garms, man are old school like this sound
I ain't new to these roads
