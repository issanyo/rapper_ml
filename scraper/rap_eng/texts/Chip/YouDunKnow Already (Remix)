[Verse 1: Megaman]
Who went plat with a couple of street niggas
And scooped eleven awards?
Filled up a couple of jets
And then they said to me gyally abroad
When my G Ghetts said Megaman's back
Fucker, what, you think it was talk?
Ghetts, tell a motherfucker who we taking to war
Of course

[Hook]
You dun know already
You, you dun know already
You du-du-du-du-dun know already
You, you, you dun know already (and so we tell 'em like)
You dun know already
You, you dun know already
You du-du-du-du-dun know already
You, you

[Verse 2: Megaman]
I'm a machine, my nigga
[?] with me, Supreme my nigga
We crink the scene like Moschino, nigga
They're cutting in the triple of a ki there, trapper
I wish there was rag for the Gs
We grind hard to cheap fees in the seat, my brudda
If you ever heard the word on the street
So Solid's always putting real niggas on to eat
Hail Mega, that's a boss

[Bridge: Megaman]
Boss, Megaman's back
TT, Megaman that
Megaman hat, ooh, beg a man chat
Slugs might swell a man's back
Dead man for ball or put man on life support
I'll send man to heaven and back
Ding ding, if you ever mek your ting ring
Then us lot'll bell a man back, something like that

[Verse 3: Frisco]
Dem man dere are some joke man
Us man are flying (you dun know already)
And when I say "BBK to the end"
Just know I ain't lying (you dun know already)
Ghetts said "Fris, do you wanna do the remix?"
I was like fam (you dun know already, ready)
Let one of them violate, I'll sky man
(Dun know already, dun know already)
(You) dun know already
Tell an MC come if you're ready
Fuck a slug fest, rudeboy
You will get a slug from the semi
Girls got a tonne load already
You dun know the jezzy all wanna bred man
Try fuck up my plans, you're a dead man
And there's one, two or three 45s on deck
Disrespek, I will take out ten man
Skengman mode, beg a man chat
Slap two and end a man chat, can't tell a man jack
Suck whose mum? Are you dumb?
I will bun man's skin if you tell a man that
Send a man Back 2 Da Lab, actually fam
Strap inna hand, I'm back with a bang
Big bag of lemon in my pocket, ya dun know the medi
Man's frass, ya dun know already

[Verse 4: Chip]
Ghetts said "gotta get Chip for the remix"
I was like yep (ya dun know already)
He said "don't slew anyone please"
I was like G (ya dun know already)
MCs piss me off so
I go off like "what?" (ya dun know already-ready)
Miss me with it
Burning spliffs and bridges (dun know already)
One shot, two shot, three shot, waved
Got CÃ®roc, got grade (lit, lit, lit)
Tell a spitta don't get in my way
I've got peppering ways (BlukuByeBye)
Some man got shots direct
Couple man caught strays (so it go)
Some man try sit on the fence
Your best bet, play safe
Cuh you don't want bars, Megaman time
Ride with us, ride, ride
I've got the spirit of Frisco inside my pen
If I aim at you, that's sky
No lie, Bluku or Boom Bye Bye
Can't take a cheque, nah, too north side (show)
Tell you how quick the ten years fly
We'll see who's still here in ten years' time

[Verse 5: Devlin]
I'm that thorn in your side and the formula's tight
When I form and I strike (ya dun know already)
One who ought to be liked for your bullshit lives
But I'm haunting this mic (ya dun know already)
Tell the fools to resign, get left wrapped, tortured and blind
It's time (ya dun know already-ready)
It's Mr Grey, 1-2
Make way for the granddad of grime
Why the fuck do I spit then? Why? Cause I'll rip them
Hyper, I'll hit 'em like hitmen, I think them
Guys all thinking their ship's Titanic (ya dun know already)
Jim Reaper will sink them
If you're a shit MC, you should've gone and sold bricks then
Don't blame us that you're shit's dead
But all laughter aside though
Why? I've got them at their wit's end
Devlin's back, so all you feminine chaps
Better get back
That's a definite fact
I'm in the chemistry lab with Ghetts and it's mad
Cause we ain't ever looked back
From 2010, confer with the fans
It's been a menacing batch
Of flows and lyrics and they'll revel in that

[Verse 6: Ghetts]
Don't trust that boy, try teef my tune
What a ginnal (ya dun know already)
How could you remix a song that ain't yours
And call it official? (ya dun know already)
I tell an MC don't send shots
At a man with a missile (ya dun know already-ready)
Man went car park
And all done the same visual (dun know already, dun know already)
Turn me up in my headphones
Kill an MC and piss on his headstone
I let men know what the skeng holds
If I let ten go, it's pimento (pepper)
Life for a death
I'll swap one of you new niggas for Esco
Retro, Megaman hat
Trench coat, get a man back, tenfold
Rebelious gat
Next flows, venomous batch
Dress code everyting black
Ghetto don't bury no hatch
Ghetto's just burying man
Hell no, don't call me a veteran, fam
I'm just a nigga that's better than man
I know you say my time's over
Now I'm back like who's relevant gang
Bang
