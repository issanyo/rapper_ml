[Chorus: Chip]
Please don't interrupt my wave
See me lit as fuck, on high grade
Overproof in my cup, I'm spaced
Please don't interrupt my wave
Beg you please don't interrupt my wave
See me lit as fuck, on high grade
Overproof in my cup, I'm spaced
Please don't interrupt my wave

[Verse 1: Chip]
Yeah
It's Friday and I'm high like bitch I think I'm smokey
Got niggas hating hi-key, hating low-key
Plane mode, high as fuck, so don't phone me
Count my money, count my blessings, keep it boasy
Tom Ford on my neck when she's sniffin' me
I just skurred her text, old ting said she missing me
Hit your city and just Rome like it's Italy
I just went through customs with a spliff on me
Flyin' straight, they know where I'm heading
So when its time to roll she wan' get in
He wants to smoke with us, we won't let him
Don't interrupt mans settings
Niggas trying everything to break me
I been a lot of things but never snakey
Roll one for my haters, keep it wavy

[Chorus: Chip]
Please don't interrupt my wave
See me lit as fuck, on high grade
Overproof in my cup, I'm spaced
Please don't interrupt my wave
Beg you please don't interrupt my wave
See me lit as fuck, on high grade
Overproof in my cup, I'm spaced
Please don't interrupt my wave

[Verse 2: Nafe Smallz]
Lets go, lets go yeah
Pour a cup, I be leanin' (yeah, yeah)
Break down the drugs on the weekend (yeah, yeah)
See how the haters are scheming (yeah, yeah)
I ain't got time to even pree them (No way)
I'm off the liquor with the G's dem (Let's go)
I'm diving straight in to the deep end
Shawty blowin' up my dm's
I'm steady wavin' to the AM to the PM, it's where I be again
I swear the devils tryna creep in
The loudest weed has got me tweaking (yeah, yeah)
Don't fuck with the vibe when I'm leanin
Wait, call the plug call the plug
Tell him I need another pack nigga
The one that he gave is not enough
The trap going crazy turnin' up
We high as fuck, high as fuck
Grade and that overproof got me turnin' up

[Chorus: Chip]
Please don't interrupt my wave
See me lit as fuck, on high grade
Overproof in my cup, I'm spaced
Please don't interrupt my wave
Beg you please don't interrupt my wave
See me lit as fuck, on high grade
Overproof in my cup, I'm spaced
Please don't interrupt my wave

[Verse 3: Sleeks]
Gear 6 on the back roads, this is my lane
Ain't new to this, been doing this before Myspace
It's still ring ring, pockets on ching ching
[?] no light like a migraine
From the block bits to the arena's
Tanita's?? to the moshpit's
Trap rap now the Peng tings wanna cuff this
Like the feds done to my brothers
In the box and they locked it
Shoes on and do road, hashtag profit
If this was a book, this is my page
Diesel in my cup, smoking light grade
Only real niggas are beside me
Please don't interrupt cause they're irate

[Chorus: Chip]
Please don't interrupt my wave
See me lit as fuck, on high grade
Overproof in my cup, I'm spaced
Please don't interrupt my wave
Beg you please don't interrupt my wave
See me lit as fuck, on high grade
Overproof in my cup, I'm spaced
Please don't interrupt my wave
