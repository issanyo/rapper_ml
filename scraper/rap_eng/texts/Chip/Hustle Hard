[Chip]
Same old shit
Just a different day
Same nigga's hatin
Just in different ways
My sister getting big
She's into Gucci shoes
I buy her what she wants
So guess what I'mma do

[Hook]
Hustle, Hustle, Hustle Hard
Hustle, Hustle, Hustle Hard
Hustle, Hustle, Hustle Hard
Hustle, Hustle, Hustle Hard

Okay, I just paid off my taxes
My god it was a madness
80g's on clothes receipts, I swear down I ain't actin
I made half a mil at 17
Made my whole hood talk about me
20 now I'm in a suite, I can't hear no talk about me
AR and we rule shit, Sammy still got a full clip
Rumours of me getting taxed
Mums life its all bullshit
Im tired of all these wash nigga's
Why ya on me If ya got figures?
Couple friends with them dirty pigs
And I turned it into them wash figures
In the west end, straight wiling
Hennesey so im smiling
I know I look like im slippin
But I got friend beside on violence
And I got a lightie on me, she's winding
She probably got a good boyfriend
The morale of the story is, keep your chick out the west end
And its Chip nigga im insane
I get ink, cause I like the pain
I spent Â£6 on my white tee, but like 30g's on my chain
So I don't give a fuck what you bitch boys think
Ill spend your pinky cost, on my drink
So you can hate me, and I can hate you
But you can't deny Im doing my thing
Nigga I go in, nigga I go wild
I go blind, I go ray charles
And I could send you niggas my stylist
But you still wouldn't have my style
Euros account, let that one pile
Tell a ex girlfriend, look at me now
I don't bare back none of these chicks
So if I was them, I would keep my child
Yeah the life I live is so crazy
Shouts to my unborn babies (sorry)
Lord forgive me I sin, but I will never let satan take me
It ain't my fault the girls rate me
Book me, fuck me, pay me
Nigga my swag is hearable, I bet a blind chick would date me
I ain't bragging dog its just life, I get more dislikes than likes
I drop every gyal for every gyal now every gyals on a hype
Keep your bitch, she ain't my type
Dog I say and get what I like
Man I git butter pecans in MIA (PHOOOM)
And I'm on a fly
Yeah I get made love in that t
Still shoppin with Green
Haircuts in Finsbury Park, I know real g's in Hornsey
Keep holy water in the basin
Got a god son called Mason
Bible at my bedside, with bullet pages for satan
