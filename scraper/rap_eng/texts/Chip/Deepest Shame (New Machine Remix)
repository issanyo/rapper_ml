[Hook: Ed Sheeran]
There's no way back from here (yeah, yeah)
Only one place left to go, one place left to go now
There's no way back from here (on out)
Only one place left to go, one place left to go

[Plan B]
Is the deepest shame
And to her that is the deepest shame

[Verse 1: Chip]
Uh, heaven or hell, I feel like someone's calling
I'm switching off my voicemail cause I ain't one for warnings
Bolt flow, these niggas can't keep up
You know my verses speak volumes, go and turn me up
See I was just a statistic but I was good with statistics
No council estate oppressions, I had to keep it realistic
My friends are up in the court dog, no plan B
They forced to sell Class A cause there was no plan B
My godson's mummy got nicked, they found a strap in her house
I was as shocked as the feds, I used to stay there myself
Jay, if you hear this I love you, just do that bird, don't speak
I've got some racks put away to help you back on your feet
Fresh outta Broadwater Farm, shoutout to Claps for them curns
Remove the hate from the children, let's teach them discipline first
If love's just a tennis game, I'm swinging my racket first
So RIP Mark Duggan, your justice still isn't served
Yo, the industry can't make me hold my mouth
Lyrically I'm the shit but they know they can't flush me out
North side, money first, whatever second
So niggas take the word hope, rip the O out and sell it
Look, on my past, I ain't dwelling
I'll spend my future repenting
For all my sins, look it's a wrap
And pussy, I am the present
I'm holding up, you hold your mouth
You set the gate, I'll take you out
And respect the fact I made it out
Of where they said there's no way out, I'm real

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Devlin]
You know the apple and core
Head might cost you a score
Or more if you want a meat show on all fours
If not I've got many more girls indoors
Shipped over and told I’ll pay em to clean and sweep my floors
How naive, now I got their passports locked in my drawers
The meat show is the best
She becomes so numb to the pain getting raped all day by the pervs and the pests
There’s only one more place she can rest (god bless)
So sir just show me your money
We don’t take card and we don’t take cheque
Even with a latex
For one this is unsafe sex

[Hook]
