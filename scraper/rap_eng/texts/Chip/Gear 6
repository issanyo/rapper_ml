[Hook x4: Wretch 32 & Chip]
Dem cannot move, while we are chilling, gear six
Get ready for some lyrical shit
Say they cannot move, while we are chilling, gear six
Get ready for some lyrical shit

[Verse 1: Wretch]
Everyone must be dizzy in the industry, they say I'm going bonkers
That's because they need some time and mine's constant
I snuck into the Champions League, I'm so Tottenham
I always see myself on the screen, I feel boxed in
Yeah, but that's easy to cope with
And I can switch up the script cuh I wrote it
Yeah, they're all acting in my scene
But the camera says that the only natural is me

[Verse 2: Chip]
If you're aiming for the top and you come across me, take a detour
Cause I can say less but make it mean more
Uh, I'm who they're throwing up a C for
I blew up in this bitch, it's Mr C4
LOL at these other spitters, they killing me
Besides having bars, I've got Royal Mail delivery
It's funny how MCing makes them angry
The same thing made me a celebrity, it's more fun
