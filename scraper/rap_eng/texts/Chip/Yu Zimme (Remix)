[Verse 1: Stylo G]
Laying to di side like Ding Dong
Chain dem a swing like swing song (ouff)
Yuh light skin girlfriend like mi
Even though mi black like King Kong
She like every picture pon mi Ingram
So right away she a sing song
Mi tell her fi call me a yardie
A me put di "G" inna England
Limited space fi di man dem
Wuleepa space fi di gyal dem
Bottles alone, so put your cups down
If a table dog, a straight shut down
Stylo make you whine up your body gyal
Bumboclart, whine up your body gyal
You nah fi ask wen you see me (wen you see me)
Every gyal you see me with a fi mi

[Chorus]
Yu Zimme, Hey
Yu Zimme, Hey
Yu Zimme, yow, every gyal you see with a fi mi
Yu Zimme, every gyal you see me with a fi mi (x3)
Yu Zimme, you nah fi ask wen you see me

[Verse 2: Chip]
Every gyal you see me with a fi mi
You see dat Every Gyal tune, yeah a fi mi
Lightie, she keep di pussy fi me
She no wear no panties when she see me
Yu Zimme, she want the willie
She want the killy
She a whale, Free Willy
Gwan Chippy, room dark, you can't see me
Dat your bra, slip it off, I love titties
It's all jiggy
Rascal, I switch up Chantelles with Chanels
Those names I'm calling, not one is my girl's
If I really called out some girls that I've slept with
Things will be awkward when I'm with my...
Stylee when I pull up in the party
Buff tings with me and my chargies
The bar said the Wray and Nephew just done
The rum we want, so send Bacardi
Chip will make you whine up your body gyal
Bumboclart, whine up your body gyal
You nah haffi ask wen you see me
Di every gyal ting start with me
Yu Zimmie

[Outro: Stylo G]
Yu Zimme, Hey
Yu Zimme, Hey
Yu Zimme
Yow, every gyal you see me with a fi mi
Yu Zimme, every gyal that see me with a fi mi (x3)
Yo, camera take out when you see me
Camera take out when you see me
