[Intro]
I'd gladly lose my life for you
I'd gladly lose my life for you

[Verse 1: Chipmunk]
If anything in your life is worth living for; trust one day you die for it
Something makes you smile so much; trust me one day you cry for it (oh)
And you can love someone without trusting them (believe)
Paranoid, but true to me
There ain't nothing she wouldn't do for me (nothing)

[Hook: Tulisa]
I'd gladly lose my life for you
I will save you baby
I'd gladly lose my life for you
I will save you baby
I'd gladly lose my life for you
If you weren't here I'd die, you are my life
When I'm not with you it feels like I'm not breathing, what I’m needing
If there was one thing that I lose
I'd gladly lose my life for you

[Verse 2: Chipmunk]
I hope it never gets to that, cause it won't be a song that could get me back
I love the mentality, Ride or Die but I'd prefer if you stayed inside
The road's ain't safe for you, haters can't get me, they get to you
So they can't know how your face looks
So the first thing you don't own is a Facebook
Sacrifices have to be made; as long as I'm in the game
I ain't trying to hide you away
I'm just trying to make a payslip with music, the flirtings work related
And you can love someone without trusting them (believe)
Paranoid but true to me
There ain't nothing she wouldn't do for me (nothing)

[Hook: Tulisa]
I'd gladly lose my life for you
I will save you baby
I'd gladly lose my life for you
I will save you baby
I'd gladly lose my life for you
If you weren't here I'd die, you are my life
When I'm not with you it feels like I'm not breathing, what I’m needing
If there was one thing that I lose
I'd gladly lose my life for you

[Verse 3: Chipmunk]
If you are down for me, I'd be down for you
Make time for me, I'll make time for you
And don't lie to me and I won't lie to you
You can call it a bond, it's more than a song
It's more than sex, we can chill when it on
I’m just keeping it cool
But I never make promises to you, promises come from a fool
I'll just give you my word
Cos that’s all that, I got, this feelings more than a lot
The money, the fame, my name, the game
If you disappear then everything stops, but still
You can love someone without trusting them, but you still put trust in me
There ain't nothing she wouldn't do for me (nothing)

[Hook: Tulisa]
I'd gladly lose my life for you
I will save you baby
I'd gladly lose my life for you
I will save you baby
I'd gladly lose my life for you
If you weren't here I'd die, you are my life
When I'm not with you it feels like I'm not breathing, what I’m needing
If there was one thing that I lose
I'd gladly lose my life for you
