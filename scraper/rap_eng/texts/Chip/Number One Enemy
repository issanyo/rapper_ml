[Verse 1]
You always think you know the better thing to do
But in this case you could be wrong
So you chuck off your shoes with an empty smile on your face
What is the problem with you?
You're constantly in a mood and you've gotta shake it off
Its getting on top of you again
Everything that I say is the icing on the cake and
You've gotta laugh at it
And put it behind you, put it behind you

[Chorus]
Stop, I'm not your number one enemy
I'm not your number one enemy
If you wanna be a part of me
I'm not your number one enemy

[Verse 2]
So, now you've got this far
Do you really want to start again on your own
You say you're eternally scarred
But its nothing we can't fix while you're at home
I'm not your number one enemy
All of you seem to be getting me
A little confused with the way that you're treating me again
We get along every now and then
We need to tie up the loose ends
I know that it will be alright
Lets stay in and talk tonight

[Chorus]
Stop, I'm not your number one enemy
I'm not your number one enemy
If you wanna be a part of me
I'm not your number one enemy
Stop, I'm not your number one enemy
I'm not your number one enemy
If you wanna be a part of me
I'm not your number one enemy

[Middle eight]
I, I, I
I may be the one to blame sometimes
But I want it like it was before
Like it was once before
And you, you, you, you're stuck
In between what you want
And whats the right thing to do
I want it like it was before
Like it was once before

[Chipmunk]
Daisy
Its 'munk
I like this
Take off, take off, Daisy's 'bout to take off
The ones you love the most in life
See you without your make-up
So, put the past behind ya
She don't wanna fight ya
You ain't hit the ceiling yet, but chill before your times up
Oh, look you must be crazy
For 1 6 she ain't your average lady
So you don't really want to go daring daisy
Now shes belling me
Best thing is just let it be
Cos all she keeps on tellin' me
Is that she ain't your enemy
She ain't your enemy
Scarlett! She ain't your enemy so
Stop!

[Chorus]
Stop, I'm not your number one enemy
I'm not your number one enemy
If you wanna be a part of me
I'm not your number one enemy
Stop, I'm not your number one enemy
I'm not your number one enemy
If you wanna be a part of me
I'm not your number one enemy
If you wanna be a part of me
I'm not your number one enemy

[Outro]
Number one enemy
Number one enemy
Number one enemy
Number one enemy
