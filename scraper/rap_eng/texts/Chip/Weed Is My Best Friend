[Verse 1: BlackThe Ripper]
Yo, look what they doin' to us people
How can you make a plant illegal
I don't give a shit I roll like it's legit
Smoke like it's legit, grow like it's legit
Fuck the government they a bunch'a haters
Think we're following your rules see you later
They're just mad cuz they know we getting paper
You ain't the creator, you can't ban nature
Stranger don't beg friend, weed is my best friend
Never ever followed the crowd I always set trends
Smoking weed on Oxford Street, West End
The levels always go sky high when I set 'dem
Ha, and yeah I do smoke the reefa
I writ this in Saint John's Antigua
I feel more creative when I'm high and you know I rep Dank Of England untill I die (and I)

[Hook: Popcaan]

Some bwoy weh a talk and a lip mi nuh trust dem
Weed is my best friend
You know, weed is my best friend

[Verse 2: Chip]
High grade 'dere I got plenty
Bun a spliff bun a MC
They're too bad mind evidently
Niggas left bitches left weed never left me
The pressure's on but Chippy won't crack
Or crumble I keep my grinder for that
Percy stash 'dere and you can't touch it
Get your own weed why you grasshoppin'?

[Hook: Popcaan]
I don’t beg friend na

And mi nuh waan si no next friend cuh

Some bwoy weh a talk and a lip mi nuh trust dem
Weed is my best friend
You know, weed is my best friend

[Verse 3: Shorty]
Yo, I've been smoking weed since a little yout
I love smoking weed when I sip a juice
After a beat then I bill a zoot
Bare cuh tellin' how they livin' room
I get girls everywhere I go
I smoke weed everywhere I go
My head's spinning like a merry-go
If you don't know Boy Better Know, trust me

[Hook: Popcaan]
I don’t beg friend na
Weed is my best friend
And mi nuh waan si no next friend cuh
Weed is my best friend

Some bwoy weh a talk and a lip mi nuh trust dem

[Verse 4: Frisco]
(Break)
Reed weed man 'ting

I bun my 'erbs and get charged up
Dem 'de weed dat make you sickle and park up
So when you see my over 'dere with my eyes all red
I'm just holding the meds, [?]
Weed ammi charge it, not the hard stuff
Flows ever so sharper, like a markup
If it ain't lemon haze 'den, it's amnesia
Puff puff on the reefa, it's a creepa

[Hook: Popcaan]
I don’t beg friend na
Weed is my best friend
And mi nuh waan si no next friend cuh
Weed is my best friend

Some bwoy weh a talk and a lip mi nuh trust dem
Weed is my best friend
You know, weed is my best friend
