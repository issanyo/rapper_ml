Look
I was in the dark praying for light years
Around the time my brother got 9 years
Appreciate the rain, that's the sky's tears
Had to get my mind clear
Said that I be back up by he's out
He's on D Cat now and I'm right here
Poppin' I know
Block girls you bread, and get dough
Just one spliff and a scripture i'm in my zone
Peak for you niggas when these weed bars flow
Get this skunk to your boat
You don't wan' no smoke
You don't drink or smoke but you ain't perfect why you talking
I ain't on the mic like you're sober and boring
Each to their own leave me lone live your life
Don't let me make it fly
Ain't no DM's when I slide
Not here to make friends or enemies
I'm here to leave a legacy
I got bounce back tendancies
Niggas tried to catch me in they web
Straight venom was the remedy
Trust, RIP NRG

You never know when you gon' go
New levels
New devils
I've been on my God flow
And when it comes to drill
I take it in but half though
Cah half of them
Ain't slapping more than strappin' bars bro
All them ends you can't go
That's no life you wan' live
When you're older with your kids
Ask your olders how it is
Parents evening with your children
Paigons still after your wig
Them stressed
There's a myth
You'll need more than a spliff

See it's mad when you're in the public eye but you're not a public guy
Bangers for the party
Fuck it, I'm the party type
Swervin chicken heads
Who wan' date all the time
(KMT)
Got big release dates on my mind
Like my brother's first day out
New album on the way out
Daniel Kaluuya, once you get out, beg you stay out
Life ain't no card game
No use for them jokers
So cut off all them roaches
And fly over them vultures
And cling onto your focus

Grab the kush
I'm going in
Pack, just landed
This ain't tuna in my tin
Stop racing everybody else
And start racing with yourself then
Even when you lose you kinda win
Look
Deal or no deal you can't merk me
Deal or no deal a man's certi
Deal or no deal you can't verse me
Na, not with these verses
Dawg even if I took one I'll be out before I'm 30

I ain't old like them niggas
Or young like them fucking lost spitters
Who start rapping then tun' killers
Got me feeling proud that I made it
Through the era I did
Where music was a way out
Not a way to trap you in
Charted on my own and with a major felt the same king
Being signed
And being independent's overrated
However life tun's out
Them funds 'affi run now
What's more important
The music or how it comes out

Weed and thoughts
This is just weed and thoughts
It's just weed and thoughts
Late nights with my weed and thoughts
It's just weed and thoughts
Weed and thoughts
This is just weed and thoughts
Weed and thoughts
This is just weed and thoughts
