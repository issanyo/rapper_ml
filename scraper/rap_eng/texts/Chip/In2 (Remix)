I'd be lying if I said you wasn't eyeing up the wretch
Girl, you're free to see the best and you ain't even gotta stress
I already got the message, I don't need to read the texts
We'll really speak in-depth when I'm deep between your legs
You played the like game on Insta for a week or two
Then you jumped in my DMs like peek-a-boo
But girl, I'm from the era of Donell Jones
Hit you on the house phone, I knew who I was speaking to
I'd be lying if I said that I was tryna be your equal, equal
Cuh juh make me only legend for you ordinary people, oh na na, yeah
And I gotta keep it shower even though I'm hot and cold

Can't ever run out of bars, even on girl tunes
Manny's a hater, tell him leave me alone
I've got my weed and my spice, I'm tryna be in my zone, ayy
Told her butterfly her legs, let me slide in
Beats on, haffi kill it now, still a grime kid
Neighbour's at the door now and she wiling
She getting too hot, cool down, slip the ice in
You lying if you said I wasn't something that you're into, into
I got niggas in their feelings cuh their ting is one I've been through, slid through
But so it go, dem bwoy there still losing, me she choosing

You're with me and we're both looking fly
But I'm not happy, girl, you're showing too much thigh
Don't lie, it's me that you're into
You say that no one does it better when I'm in you
Have you ever fell in love with a king, boo?

All these bitches on me, girl, I need you for protection
I can get a little picky, man, I know you've learnt your lesson
