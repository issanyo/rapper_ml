[Interlude]

You know sometimes, you have to make your visual, yeah, yeah

[Hook - Kalenna]

If wishes were horses, then beggars would ride
And they would all come to lie
If we all have dreams we'd be starry eyed
And we would all come to lie
And I'd be telling you white lies, whoa
Yeah I'd be telling you white lies

[Verse 1 - Chipmunk]

Check, would you believe me if I told you some people do anything to please me
From burning my own CD as a free be
To shop and taking pictures with my fans in Sainsbury's
Like I wonder if this company still got my CV
Deep in, into my pocket no wallet, I'm feeling jeans
But this pocket full of dreams, ain't buying me what I need
They say I should have loved this paper cause it's only made from trees
But I need this lavish life from LV this isn't free, let's ride

[Hook]

[Verse 2 - Chipmunk]

Yeah, see I was crying out for help but ain't nobody hear my screams
Plus the Lord's the only person I let see me on my knees
I don't wanna hear myself, turn me off don't turn me up
And they kick you when you're down now so the trick is to stay up
Plus as long as I'm alive, guess I'm running out of time
Got my Rolley hands in sweeping hand, tired of clockwise
Some get left behind who don't move with the times
Looking back, the only thing I wouldn't change was my mind
Let's ride, let's ride

[Hook]

[Verse 3 - Chipmunk]

Now the reason that you fell ain't because you never climbed
Now you're looking at your legs trying to work out where you stand
See my dream came to life and OK's came to death
Caught up to your imagination running faster than your legs
Now I feel I need to live before I end up lifeless
I'm trying to buy time even though it's priceless
Dealing with the pressures of the game
Like I know that it's my decade and it'll have to be my game, lets flight

[Hook]
