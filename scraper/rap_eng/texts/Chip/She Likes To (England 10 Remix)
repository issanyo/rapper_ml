[Intro: J2K]
She likes to drink it
She grabs the glass and likes to sip it
She loves Champagne, rosé campaigns
If you got a bottle then she wants to drink it

[Verse 1: J2K]
She loves the whole flex
When I'm bringing the bottles
In Christian Audigier
Can't copy him (uhuh, uhuh)
She love the colour of the bottle though
Get her little hands on it, she's a bottle o-pen-er
But yo, this ones a rosé
Watch her twist the top then follow up
You can learn a few things just swallow up
You dun know what Madonna does
She's telling me

[Verse 2: Wrigley]
She likes to wine on it
Short skirt look kind of fine in it
Yeah she likes to whine on it
That's why I keep my eyes on it
I'm in the club, just clock something nice
Eyes on her wondering "what's on her mind?" - me!
I was watching her wind
Like I was minding her drink, watching her wine
I'm fly in the club, my lyrics are the shit
There's flies on my book
I'm shining because I'm blessed and I'm wise
You know I've got girls to the left and the right

[Verse 3: Ice Kid]
She loves what I be
Me and my team run the grime scene
Covered in Ice Cream down to my feet
Check the icey on the back of my jeans
When I hit the rave, dog, its ???
Have the bottle of ??? no Renault, no Focus
A class, triple a pass, and a quick entrance - no joke thing
Come here to rep for the rave
But if anyone steps in my face
I'm setting a pace, it's all weapons ablaze
I ain't telling them I step with the [...]

[Verse 4: Wretch 32]
Look, she likes to tease me
But im outta this world with E.T
She knows the Wretch is greasy
We'll get connected with BT
Why you gotta be like that
I ain't trying to be your man
That's Ironik, babe
I see your plan, in fact I'm on it
So be proud to meet your match
With no pitch, or referee
We'll do this in the Westwood: Legendary
I ain't doubting I'm fast
Your my head mistress but I'm out of your class

[Verse 5: Ghetts]
She likes the carnival
Favourite film; Love & Basketball
I'm a hot boy, here comes the barbecue
She's got a man but I'm unregardable
I might link up with somebody's woman
Just because somebody bet me I couldn't
If she ain't a good'n
I'll bring the whole hood in
From when I get my foot in her door, I keep pushing
Because if I get breakfast then I want extras
Lunch, dinner and pudding, I'm looking
Drive way, do it my way when I'm pulling
Give her the hood, which one of you wouldn't?

[Verse 6: Wiley]
She likes to the dance some
I'm here again to hype the dance, got
Girls a lot inside the dance
Can't forget the three that like to dance
Yo, do a one step, two step, three step
Billy came back for the remix
And all the girls that we get
Want to see the sun like phoenix
Ain't no B-list
The route I took was a scenic
Straight to the corner of the club
I'm a relish
She's not giving a damn
Where she's putting her hands
We've got similar plans for this evening

[Verse 7: Bashy]
She likes my t-shirt (bish, bash, bosh)
Wants me to pipe and breed her
Plus, her ex man's a idiot
Me her and her best friend can threesome
It's a one grand, two grand, more
I can afford anything that she wants
(What did you lash bash?) course!
When I finished, she couldn't walk
Dead, she was a corpse
Then I taught her the latest craze
Know, Gracious K
Take your right then your left
Then put both hands on my head
(Show me how you get down)

[Verse 8: Scorcher]
She likes the winner flow
And the way I directed the video
Check one, check two
Check when you see me though
I look like money in the wallet
Big money in my wallet
Honey if I'm on it
We can make loving on the bonnet
Can I grab the Bent' off Will
Look down, its kinda got a gentle feel
Look round, it's kinda like sex on wheels
Chain all blinging
Big stage, a cane all swinging
Dropped a little change on Wigan
F' them pennys
I stay for the pimps, I'm getting

[Verse 9: Chipmunk]
She ain't in to grime, fam (no she ain't)
But I know she knows who I am
I'm in the dance
10 man done already got parred
But there's only one can than I can
First thing's first, I am not on the grind
Diamonds independent, my sign
Got females totally on it
She looked at my wrist and was like
"God damn, Chip, what's that?"
A mortgage deposit
I'm just being modest
I mean honest, it's all the truth
You can blame it on me, girl, fuck the Goose
Munk

[Verse 10: Griminal]
Nasty she likes me. Me. Me. Me. Me
M-m-m-m-m-m-m me, me
It's all about me
Me and the money, man
It's all bout P's
G's, Girl is like "Griminal, sleep"
Boy with a bad bitch, Griminal be
The new school lyrical G
Girl on their knees like "Griminal, please..!"
Griminal wants, Griminal needs
4 bill a show be the minimal fee

[Outro]
Change, change
Change, change
Change, change
Change, change
Change, change
Change, change
