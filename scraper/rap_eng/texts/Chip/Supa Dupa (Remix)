[Verse 1: Griminal]
Coming through your radio, it's Griminal
Don't listen, he ain't really saying nothing lyrical
Ain't it typical?
What's that? He ain't original
He ain't supa dupa, what's that? He ain't invincible
Just too many envious
He ain't got a thing to talk about
I really think dudes need to sort it out cuh
I'm doing me, I hope you're doing yourself
I'm doing these shows
If not I'm probably doing your girl
So take that

[Verse 2: Chipmunk]
I'm like guess who's back
Made some bubblegum pop, tell a hater true that
Versatility shows, check my stats
Supa dupa on any type of fucking track
No appreciation, you don't have to
I made what I made so these kids wouldn't have to
Now everybody's going at Chip, stop trying
Claiming you don't wanna get signed, why you lying?
Yeah, ain't nuttin' changed, still a beast
Might cop an apartment in the east
Salute Devs, salute Ghetts, salute G
They came from the school of the hard knocks with me
We used to kill, fuck radio sets
Now PRS checks tell us radio's blessed
Thanks to me, the opposition's depressed
Got a hundred bags on me, saying Griminal's next

[Verse 3: Ghetts]
I'm super, no cape, Lex Luther's old mate
And if you ever get rude, I'll remove your whole face
Who's assuming I'm a human?
BBM face, confusion
I was with Lois before she became Susan
Somebody tell David Cameron he shoulda hollered at Ghetts
Cause I'm the only one that can control these students
Wait, it's too late, I wanna join the revolution
I be front line at the stand-off
I'm black and powerful, but I ain't Hancock
And I can make a tower fall like Sadam's lot
I'm Mr. Radical, and what?
For two eleven, I'mma hit 'em with my newest weapon
Are you forgetting I'm the nigga that will use the venom?
I find a riddim then I write the lyrics, sky's the limit
Well, I'm chilling on the roof of heaven

[Verse 4: Lil Nasty]
I'll be with the superstars, jumping out of super cars
I'll be flowing super hard, yeah, I got them super bars
It's Narst, I'm full of energy, supercharged
I'm about to blow, real talk, no false alarm
We stick together cause they hope that we fall apart
In 010 I went ghost like a haunted yard
True say I go, they wanna know where I bought my garms
I'm make my music appeal and go in all the charts
I'm from the underground with that super sound
Tryna make my mama super proud so I can move her out
To a super house, but for now I'm getting rid of weight
Like I'm losing pounds, aiming at my target, ima shoot it down
See, I like to blaze, that's how I surf the waves
Grey Goose, blue cheese and some purple haze
See I'm a loose one, and by the way
I just had to say the only KA I like's fruit punch

[Verse 5: Krept]
Your girl said I'm rather super
She knows I give her something she ain't used to
She weren't on it, till I seduced her
Gave her that morning cock, I'm a rooster
Your girl follow me, unlike you sir
The girls wanna beat, I'm the producer
If I tell three girls, karma sutra
At least two will, like a scooter
Your girl said I'm brilliant, super
Why you think I got my willy on her hooters?
Yeah, I done it all with your chick
Now she grabbing on my balls and my stick, snooker
Got her sweating out her new perm
Got the church girls yelling hallelujah
I'm signing out
So I'm flying like Medusas

[Verse 6: Wretch 32]
S-U-P-A W-R-E-T-C-H
I hustle with half nines, got the street wave
Could struggle in hard times, was a teenage
You never could cross I less you see straight, Logan
Wolverine, hold 'em
Think being tough's in their genes, till I fold 'em
I was the best kept secret
Now I'm on air, guess it's out in the open
Close down every single show I get
You can't not get the message when it's so direct
Tweet tweet, everybody knows I'm Wretch
140 characters couldn't clone my sense
Yeah, I got flow times depth
Swimming to the mainstream, I'mma hold my breath
And exhale when I did this
I know what you're thinking, I'm a misfit

[Verse 7: Baby Blue]
I'm so super, super duper duper
Meet me in the car, yeah and I am Blue sir
Got you feeling tiny, TI
Mini like Cooper, I think you need a booster
I ain't what you used to, me, I'm so super
Listen, I'll embarrass ya, make you turn fuscia
Never come alone, even with the cheque in my hand
I got some high rollers in my pocket, I can introduce ya
I got some copy cats, cheap imitation
See, I'm the hostess, check ya invitation
I don't miss a trick, now I don't need to catch it
Yes, I got the train waiting for me at the station
I'm so super, yeah I'm in your eye line
I got a star looking something like a night light
Still a few out there that are sleeping on Blue
But those bitches better wake up, rooster
