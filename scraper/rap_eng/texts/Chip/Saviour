[Verse 1]
I never picked this, this picked me
I weren't your average pickney
So many young boys wanna MC
Oh lord I don't know why you picked me
They wanna prick me, tryna hush me rush me
No hurdles jumped me
Just cos I'm moving Louis V, Gucci, Fendi shoes
Here I'm still improving
If it's dead I left it
If I touched it it's epic
The 16 verses so valuable
Cool kid I do it all so casual, so flammable
Since "Fire Alie", I was gone
There ain't even a hook on the song
All I need is a pad and a wand
Like don't you know that I'm the saviour

[Hook]
Please don't mess with me
Dead no destiny
Please don't fuck with me
I never chose this, this is prophecy
The saviour
Will I get to the top yes
Destination success
I just can't settle for less
Push up my chest
To me I'm the best
Saviour
The saviour
The saviour
I never chose this this is prophecy
Saviour
The saviour
The saviour

[Verse 2]
I never dissed them, they dissed me
No reply was the best attack
Me and them ain't on the same level man
So how can we go back to back
Track for track, tit for tat
Got a blind date but ya gal miss and match
I still know where I'm heading
Married to the game, best man, no wedding
Somebody tell 'em
You can cuss if you want it
But it's a hit if I'm on it
Let me come on your tune and fuck you up
A million bees can't match the buzz, that I'm building up
Since Fire Alie I was gone
There ain't even a hook on the song
All I need is a pad and a wand
Like don't you know that I'm the saviour

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Anything I do I merk
I'm proof that praying works
Course them man are mad
Came in the game no name
Shot past I know it hurts
Of course I deserve to be where I am
When I come from where I come
And I don't mind being assessed
But let's not forget like I hate it when nigga my ground was done
Thy kingdom's come
Just words on a beat
Got your girl at my feet
Got a least another 10 years to go
Cos it never took me 10 years to blow
Can you hear the flow?
Since Fire Alie I was gone
There ain't even a hook on the song
All I need is a pad and a wand
Like don't you know that I'm the saviour

[Hook]
