Dear, I love music baby
There goes the kiss because shes my lady
But everybody wants to try me lately
So I'm easin' off the bus and pedal biking lately
See music it brings me haters
Haters got wifeys they bring me papers
And the mummys do love these MC
So the apple doesn't fall too far from the tree
I'm movin up so I'm celebratin'
The girls offer brain but I'm educated
Thanks for always I'm elevatin'
So me and roll hype get segregating
I live a love with a best it's blatent
My watch said that there ain't time for haters
So if you look for trouble no I ain't into that
I'm just a cool dude out for papers

Ah haaah
My names chip diddy chip
I don't ever tolerate lip diddy lip
I don't play around I'm just trying to do my music
But say the wrong thing and I'll flip diddy flip
Some say it's luck but I don't give a shit
Wave to ma haters like see you at the top
I'm the best in the bizz rite next to the kid
Everybody say my name now Chip Diddy Chip

There like chips he's a swagger don
Annoys the haters like a tag along
E2 cause he noes I'm not havin none
If your cool I'm cool we can get along
Diferent day same issue you no what I'm on
No one ain't eatin if chippy ain't gettin none
They can have half a pie if I'm gettin one
But once I bake mine everybodys getin sum
Cause you know just how I stay
If you help me eat mine you get paid
And all over town you know what they say
Chipmunks too cold no you don't say

I drink tea like music pays
It's like more more money more haters hate
I'm in the studio from day to day
It's like work work work they can't knock the raise
A clever man tried bumpin' me
But ain't stupid you can count my A's
Yo class let me have your attention
Settle down everyone to thier seats
Calm down, calm down, calm down
I've got your test results
Some of you hace done very well
You with the bunches straight A star
Some of you have done very badly
Rech 32 out of a 100 son
Chipmunk what have you got to say for your self

My names chip diddy chip
I don't ever tolerate lip diddy lip
I don't play around I'm just trying to do ma music
But say the wrong thing n I'll flip diddy flip
Some say it's luck but I don't give a shit
Wave to my haters like see you at the top
I'm the best in the bizz rite next to the kid
Everybody say my name now Chip Diddy Chip

And ain't nobody floppin me
Check the youtube everybodys watchin me

I say turn left n everybody follows me
[? ]
I don't watch face but everybodys flockin me
Yes I am chipmunk there's no other me
See me n it look like I'm talkin to my self
Look I'm only spittin bars man please don't bother me
Once a son ain't nobody hot for me
Past the moon ain't a star that's the other me
The other stars make room
When I'm coming through beside bars
I'm in control of the galaxy
I don't play no games so don't challenge me
These youths are just nokin ma salary
I love bars like I need more calouries
It's kinder garden anz same ain't ready for the paroply
Ye look the stars ere plz
Ps give me a drum roll please
