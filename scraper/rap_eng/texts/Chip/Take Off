[Intro: Chipmunk]
This might be right, the realest song I ever wrote, yeah

[Hook: Trey Songz]
I never thought I'd see the day when you wasn't by my side
Listen, I was down for you girl, put you first in my world and I thought you were down to right
It's like you didn't want me to take off, take off, take off
It's like you didn't want me to take off, take off, but now I'm leaving

[Verse 1: Chipmunk]
I live my life in a limelight, pap lights, award shows
Red floors, booji bars, yes it's what I'm meant for
And we ain't quite the same as we used to be
My life's in the public eye, I know you don't want yours to be
Truthfully, 2 years in, it's still new to me
I wouldn't say you're comfortable, I would say you're used to me
Hence separatin' doesn't seem real
They tell me Chip keep the girl that you had before the deal, yeah

[Pre-Hook: Chipmunk]
You can call this my ref flow
'Cause this decision might determine how the game goes
Every time you get use me bein' here, I go
On that note, that's my cue to go, yeah

[Hook: Trey Songz]
I never thought I'd see the day when you wasn't by my side
Listen, I was down for you girl, put you first in my world and I thought you were down to right
It's like you didn't want me to take off, take off, take off
It's like you didn't want me to take off, take off, but now I'm leaving

[Verse 2: Chipmunk]
If it ain't a push forward it's a slow down
It's kind of ironic that I slow down
It's best that I go now rather than later
Before you claim I'm too busy chasin' that paper, it's true talk
And to say it's over, there ain't no good words
I don't think anybody breaks up on good terms
So I'ma hit the club, get my mingle on
Get my single on and throw it in a single song, yeah

[Pre-Hook: Chipmunk]
You can call this my ref flow
'Cause this decision might determine how the game goes
Every time you get use me bein' here, I go
On that note, that's my cue to go, yeah

[Hook: Trey Songz]
I never thought I'd see the day when you wasn't by my side
Listen, I was down for you girl, put you first in my world and I thought you were down to right
It's like you didn't want me to take off, take off, take off
It's like you didn't want me to take off, take off, but now I'm leaving

[Verse 3: Chipmunk]
They always ask me if I'm single in interviews
I was too scared to say I'm into you
Movin' like a single dude, didn't ever lie but I skipped the truth
Its past breaks now, fuck it, interlude
On my own, feelin' like I've got a point to prove
Hungry but I don't wanna have my cake and eat it too
And it's not that I ain't feelin' you
I'm leavin' us, I ain't leavin' you, yeah

[Pre-Hook: Chipmunk]
You can call this my ref flow
'Cause this decision might determine how the game goes
Every time you get use me bein' here, I go
On that note, that's my cue to go, yeah

[Hook: Trey Songz]
I never thought I'd see the day when you wasn't by my side
Listen, I was down for you girl, put you first in my world and I thought you were down to right
It's like you didn't want me to take off, take off, take off
It's like you didn't want me to take off, take off, but now I'm leaving
