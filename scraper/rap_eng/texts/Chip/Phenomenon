I met this posh chick in district, she was on the E
Said she love Tinie Tempah but she can’t stand me
20 man deep, put on for the team
Pull up on the red carpet, stinking of green
You wanna test me? Come
You niggas ain’t fucking with me, I’m a nun
My wrist game be a confusing one
‘Cause my Rolex smart but my Hublot dumb
I’m an educated nigga, can you say the same?
A’s in class, never sold class A
Know niggas with degrees, still can’t get a job
If keys open doors what’s the price on the box?
I'm fronting for my niggas, shit I’m talking bait
North side niggas still good on my estate
And I be doing shit that my city never seen
Word to Big it’s all a dream, now I’m rapping with the greats
I be sliding with my nigga, driving on a band
The way we getting cheese got me smiling to the cam
So I don’t want drama with none of you actors
Way bigger fish to fry than you snappers
Everyone’s a gangsta, somebody lying
Bare rap beef, nobody dying
Niggas say my name for views, don’t try it
I just get the money, I don’t be the client
You don’t want shrooms, we go blind over here
Stop the beat, rip you out your seat, musical chairs
State side, yeah they love my accent over there
And I ain’t got swag my nigga, I got flare
And I ain’t dropped a single but a nigga stayed hot
And I don’t need to name drop to make my tape pop
So fuck these hating ass niggas, don’t want it
I’ma motherfuck her pussy, bet your baby mother on it
