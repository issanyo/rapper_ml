[Chorus]
Pre-roll hit the road, thats my Settings (That's my Settings)
Pick up by the O, thats my Settings (That's my Settings)
6 Bottles of Moet, thats my Settings (Settings, settings, settings)
That Nectar best be Rose , thats my settings
Book that flight and go, thats my Settings (That's my settings)
We take them hoes like clothes, thats my Settings (Settings, settings, settings)
Country doing Views thats my Settings (That's my Settings)
Buff ting in the room thats my Settings

[Verse 1: Chip]
I got bad habits I ain't stressing though
Sex and weed thats good for my depression though
So fuck your fella and let him go
Sometimes I want a wife, sometimes I'm pressing hoes
My Bruddas getting cash, yeah we collectin'
Cos hitting raves is dead thats not my Settings
We dishing back at bruddas disrespectin'
You pussys love to dish, Can you tek it?
Just tryna get this money with my bredrins
You switch up over p's thats not my Settings no
Them man put the pre in pretending
A bag of man and no gyal thats not my Settings no

[Chorus]
Pre-roll hit the road, thats my Settings (That's my Settings)
Pick up by the O, thats my Settings (That's my Settings)
6 Bottles of Moet, thats my Settings (Settings, settings, settings)
That Nectar best be Rose , thats my settings
Book that flight and go, thats my Settings (That's my settings)
We take them hoes like clothes, thats my Settings (Settings, settings, settings)
Country doing Views thats my Settings (That's my Settings)
Buff ting in the room thats my Settings

[Verse 2: Chip]
London's always cold, thats not my Settings
Trinidad lets go, lets switch the Settings
Niggas preein' snaps, they preein' settings
Girls don't like your crew, you're too depressing
Chippy's back and flexing, they did not expect this
I've been doing settings, you look so upsetting
Searching for new melodies, cut off all my frenemies
Found out half these niggas weren't as real as they pretend to be
Just tryna get this money with my bredrins
You switch up over p's thats not my settings no
Them man put the pre in pretending
A bag of man and no gyal thats not my Settings no

[Chorus: Chip & Varren Wade]
Pre-roll hit the road, thats my Settings (That's my Settings)

We take them hoes like clothes, thats my Settings (Settings, settings, settings)
Country doing Views thats my Settings (That's my Settings)

Pre-roll hit the road, thats my Settings (Oh yeah, oh yeah)
Pick up by the O, thats my Settings (That's my Settings)
