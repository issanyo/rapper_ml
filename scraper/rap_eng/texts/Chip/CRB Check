[Chorus: Not3s]
I gotta protect my heart

Quick CRB check to pree up your history
Hope my boys ain't been there in the past
I gotta protect my heart
I gotta protect my heart
Quick CRB check to pree up your history
Hope my boys ain't been there in the past

[Verse 1]
Line poppin' like a trapper
And she know every rapper
But even if I trust her
I can't trust these rappers
I pray to God to protect my path
There ain't no condom to put on my heart
Like no, no, no, no
I ain't saying she a hoe
But she be backstage
At like nearly every show
She just wan' a young fly nigga with some dough
Man I wouldn't be surprised
If I heard she linkin' Not3s
Had a good girl she told me lies as well
Two twos I started telling lies as well
Young nigga living my life put my hood in tonight
Put my heart in it time will tell
Zoobie and maggy having a epiphany
I'll get rid of her nah she ain't getting rid of me
I had enough of this girl
Man she taking liberties
I said come and chill with me
She said I'm going Libertine

[Chorus: Not3s]
I gotta protect my heart
I gotta protect my heart
Quick CRB check to pree up your history
Hope my boys ain't been there in the past
I gotta protect my heart
I gotta protect my heart
Quick CRB check to pree up your history
Hope my boys ain't been there in the past

[Verse 2]
Yo
Man a bubbling again
Make another banger man
Just bubble through the pain
Heart bruck once
Nah it can't bruck again
So even though she trouble
I might trouble it again
Hittin' up her phone
I'm like "Baby where you at?"
Missing all my texts but she hittin' me on snap
Heart on my sleeve
But it's hidden in my tatts
(Kmt)
No time for girls like that
That's why I love my down arse ting
Just hits me on WhatsApp
No Facebook
No Insta
No Snapchat
Wamp fi' dis gyal
One bag of back chat
Perm your mouth
My girl, just relax that
Having a epiphany
I get rid of her nah she ain't getting rid of me
I had enough of this girl
Man she taking liberties
I said "Come and chill with me"
She said "I'm going Libertine"

[Chorus: Not3s]
I gotta protect my heart
I gotta protect my heart
Quick CRB check to pree up your history
Hope my boys ain't been there in the past
I gotta protect my heart
I gotta protect my heart
Quick CRB check to pree up your history
Hope my boys ain't been there in the past

[Verse 3: Not3s]
You ain't gotta stay
You can go and link another man
I'm up so I'll always have the upper hand
Man I saw her as potential wifey before
But these rappers already put pipes in her walls
Don't stay
Go and link another man
I'm up but I've always had the upper hand
And I saw you as potential wifey before
But rappers already put pipes in your...

[Chorus: Not3s]
I gotta protect my heart
I gotta protect my heart
Quick CRB check to pree up your history
Hope my boys haven't been there in the past
I gotta protect my heart
I gotta protect my heart
Quick CRB check to pree up your history
Hope my boys haven't been there in the past
