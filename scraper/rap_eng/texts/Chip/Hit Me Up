[Hook: Ella Mai]
You don't ever hit me, up, up, up
Why you think I give no fucks
Fucks, fucks aah
How come you don't hit me...?
I got options couldn't wait on you
Sleeping on me, stayed awake for you
Up
How come you don't hit me?
Thinkin' that my world would change for you
Tables turning, running games on ya
Trust, cause you don't ever hit me

[Verse 1: Chip]
I admit that I'm a prick at times
Sorry if I make you sick at times
I've been switching countries, switching lines
Playing for me, now you're switchin' sides
Had a couple lovers there for you
Waiting for you, while you cared for me
On the ends you're hearing bare stories
Leave the bed and you don't hear from me
Tell me where you think you're going?
Helped you know yourself, you know it
Feeling things and never show it
Feelings growing, now you're going
I've been drinking, rolling, holy smokes
This ain't how it really goes
Cause you're the one I feel to phone

[Hook: Ella Mai]
You don't ever hit me, up, up, up
Why you think I give no fucks
Fucks, fucks aah
How come you don't hit me...?
I got options couldn't wait on you
Sleeping on me, stayed awake for you
Up
How come you don't hit me?
Thinkin' that my world would change for you
Tables turning, running games on ya
Trust, cause you don't ever hit me

[Verse 2: Chip]
All the years amount to nothing
Going nowhere, why you rushing
Buff as fuck your DM's poppin'
I'll still be here when you drop him
Praying you'll be back
How am I fronting on you
He's got nothing on me
She's got nothing on you
Chillin' with my dons I'm lean, I'm thinking of you
Sleeping with me thinking that I'm sleeping on you
But now I'm open for discussion
You took the gamble, I was bluffin'
I guess I wasn't with the cuffin'
I've been drinking, rolling, holy smokes
This ain't how it really goes
Cause you're the one I'm suppose to phone

[Hook: Ella Mai]
You don't ever hit me, up, up, up
Why you think I give no fucks
Fucks, fucks aah
How come you don't hit me...?
I got options couldn't wait on you
Sleeping on me, stayed awake for you
Up
How come you don't hit me?
Thinkin' that my world would change for you
Tables turning, running games on ya
Trust, cause you don't ever hit me (Up)

[Verse 3: Ella Mai]
All the same
I can see myself falling
If I don't change, I took all your bullshit when
All I ever needed was some honesty
That good lovin', no fuss
Why you wanna complicate the simple things?
Everything you said you'd do
He's doing it
And that's what makes you call me up
With your fake love
That you believe, that's good enough for us
I can see myself falling if
I love what your sayin', hypnotize but

[Hook: Ella Mai]
You don't ever hit me, up, up, up
Why you think I give no fucks
Fucks, fucks aah
How come you don't hit me...?
I got options couldn't wait on you
Sleeping on me, stayed awake for you
Up
How come you don't hit me?
Thinkin' that my world would change for you
Tables turning, running games on ya
Trust, cause you don't ever hit me
