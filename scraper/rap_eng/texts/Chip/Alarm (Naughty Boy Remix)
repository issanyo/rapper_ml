[Verse 1: Anne-Marie]
You lay here with me, you're shutting down
I smell her on ya, I'm focused now
I know what's going on in your head, yeah
I know what's happened here in our bed, yeah
Your phone is buzzing, so pick it up
I know she calling, so what the *pause*?
I should've known a cheat stays a cheater
So here we are

[Chorus: Anne-Marie]
And there goes the alarm ringing in my head
Like somebody said, "Don't you trust him, no"
Texting from his ex, what did you expect?
Now you're lying here knowing where he goes
Now he gotta get ya, karma's gonna get ya
Same way that they come, that's the way they go
Now he gotta get ya, rewinding the picture
There goes the alarm and the sirens go
There goes the alarm

[Verse 2: Chip]
Girl, I know that women get protective
But don't go through my phone, you're no detective
If you storm out my yard, I guess it's over
Call me a dog, a chip on your shoulder, who do you blame? The dog or the owner?
Graphic lyrics, graphic life, I was on graphic stuff
I've spent too much time in your stomach for you to hate my guts
I'm still London Boy, the girls show me love
Drama's here cuh I was acting up
Say it out, don't believe ya
Who's the Lemsip for your fever?
Ain't too late to say sorry
I'm a belieber
If I was the type that nobody wanted, would you still want me?
Snooze your alarm, you've still got me

[Chorus: Anne-Marie]
And there goes the alarm ringing in my head
Like somebody said, "Don't you trust him, no"
Texting from his ex, what did you expect?
Now you're lying here knowing where he goes
Now he gotta get ya, karma's gonna get ya, yeah
Same way that they come, that's the way they go
Now he gotta get ya, rewinding the picture
There goes the alarm and the sirens go
There goes the alarm

[Bridge: Anne-Marie]
Bang bang, two shots fired
Man down, one fool, one liar
Ring ring, trust gone missing
House on fire, house on fire
Bang bang, two shots fired
Man down, one fool, one liar
Ring ring, trust gone missing
House on fire

[Outro: Anne-Marie]
And there goes the alarm
There goes the alarm
There goes the alarm
There goes the alarm
And there goes the alarm
There goes the alarm
