[Instrumental 1: "Ghetto Kyote" by Treble Clef]
I know you man just might run out of bars
Chip can't run out of bars
I know you man just might run out of bars
Chip can't run out of bars
I know you man just might run out of bars
Chip can't run out of bars
I know you man just might...

On the mic right now, start a fight right now
Went left but I'm right now, it's alright now
You ain't got a plaque, pipe down
Peng lighty, that's mine
She wants D, look, I wanna write right now
Told her listen up babe, I'll fill up this page and
Bring the pipe right round
And fix your leak, man make the fish go deep
I grab the pen, it's peak
Man think they can murk me, OMG
Big up, you've got big dreams
C-H-I to the P, that lyrical G
Top 90s baby's MC
My man said that he don't take coke
Looked at his nose like "that's not weed"
Me, I'm Michael Jackson of grime
This year I'm going on Bad 25
Done with the sly digs, actually try
Look, actually blud I can actually rhyme
You with the words as hard as eggs
Look, you can get scrambled, boiled or fried
I get high, I listen to Sox
So on the mic, I pulled up mine
Yeah, big up grime and what it surfaced
I disappeared, I ain't perfect
But I'll done ya dance with these verses
I don't know what I'm doing but it's working
Me, I think and see beyond the surface
I might do a song featuring myself
So I can know how it feels to feel nervous
Fam, have you got the right idea?
Chipmunk's back, verbal diarrhoea
Who's the MC I'm supposed to fear?
Believe your own hype until I'm here
You can't hide the truth
Don't want fire? Boy, hide the booth
I heard Tinie's Fire in the Booth
Oi Charlie, that weren't fire in the booth
Want fire? You can count on me
Torn ligament in my knee
So right now I can't bend it like Beckham
But you can get a toe punt out the scene
Watch out, this year I'm coming, yo
Pepper man, I've got the curry flow
And I'll have dinner with the royal family
If they all agree to have curry goat
And give my mum's husband his Visa
I came back wiser and deeper
The whole of England better wake up
Chipmunk's back in your speaker
2015, I'm not ramping
Wallahi Adeen I'm on a mad ting
F your deal and your campaign
Leap on the mic, I do my damn ting
Until I die, I rep my scene
Boy better know Cash Motto's my team
Scrapping for fans? Nope, that's not me
Soon, soon, see me on ITV
Yeah, Master Wong passed me his chi
Shaolin Munk, what you know about me?
I bless the beat, my bars are the sneeze
My fire burns be on third degree
Woo! Still do it big though
I had gyal on my Ericsson, gyal on my Nokia
Back when this was my ringtone
Man don't know what Chip's on
They're like rah, what planet is Chip from?
I've got two pages now full of bars
I put my pen down, becuh my spliff's done, yeah

Like what, you want more, you want more?
8, 16, 24
When my bars clap, clap, clap, clap, clap
Man down, no encore, yeah
Trust me, man better leave me alone
Sniper flow, cap one in your dome
High grade spliff, back in my zone
So many bars, I'm a crew on my own
I've got the title MC
Strip man of the title MC
You don't want to rival MC
Cuh you can't survival MC
Chipmunk, I was born to MC
Don't test me, I'll morgue an MC
I'm a father, I've born some MCs
But listen, I'll still abort an MC

I'm not done, give me more, give me more
8 bars, 16 or 24
Pull up in the dance, get a reload fam
With a 16, I wrote a 16 at 24
When I spit this bar in my 30s
Wanna understand you can't murk me
And the little sly digs don't hurt me
Listen, I'm a big man but I'm not 30
Man know the scene, man know I'm from it
Man just gassed, man don't want it
Man know Chipmunk, man know I'm froggy
Mic in my right hand, you don't want it
Listen, I'm a cool lad, not bad
But when I put my pen to my pad, it's like a gat
Anytime I bust a rhyme, I make it clap
Look how I'm moving it forward, bringing it back
Cut the beat, F that, bring it back
Listen we can get a set vibe live on the track

[Break: Chip sends for Tinie Tempah after hearing his 2014 Fire in the Booth]

[Instrumental 2: "Warning" by D.O.K]
Yo, I've got lyrics better than all your lyrics
Trust me, forget your lyrics
If I look you dead in your eyes and spit mine
You'll forget your lyrics
Forget your lyrics, I'll pull up and check your lyrics
No intellect, your lyrics
Yout man, property ladder, my lyrics
Don't know how far you'll get your lyrics
Party, jumping lyrics, dumping lyrics
Bored-in-my-front-room lyrics
Gyal dem love me lyrics
Girls don't dump me lyrics
Hide your girl, I've got lyrics
Stacks on Instagram
Trust me, fam, you can't buy lyrics
Told Starvz bill it
And he did, threw me a spliff, more lyrics
I go Shalo's house to write lyrics
Man are paro' now cause my lyrics
You'll all get narrowed down cause my lyrics
I'm still living off my old lyrics
But not living off my old lyrics
You know that boy got the flow
2015, I'm ready to go
Yeah, I touch pen and pad, flows
When I touch pen and pad, go
When you touch pen and pad, no
When you touch pen and pad, home
This music ting's not for everyone
I repeat, not for everyone
I've got a big head, no Kompany
But right now I'm tackling everyone
Yeah, Cash Motto fam with me
If I'm in your ends, that's man's city
Blood couldn't make my team no closer
C to the M, that's family
15, I lost my family
Mum left Dad, that was sad to me
I was in the studio, angry
That's when I wrote "Dear Family"
I guess the kid's into money and things
Put my hand on my heart, that was bad of me
You're at home like you still got bars
Nah fam, this is art for my gallery
Right now I'm in another galaxy
I should sell this ship for a Picasso wage
To anyone that tried block my path
Go suck your mum, I'm back, it's rage
Go suck your gyal, I'm back, it's rage
Somebody's gonna feel my pain
Or somebody's gonna feel a page
I do not miss when I aim
Yeah, you buck me any time of the week
Not one out of seven will be your days
And yeah, I got songs for days
But I still got bars to spray

Chick-King eater, T-high streeter
Gladesmore jumper, Adidas sneaker
Prada wearer, lyrical MC tearer
Straight out the 90's
Came out the chlorine now I see
You vs me on you that's not fair
Peep at the top, still there, yeah
