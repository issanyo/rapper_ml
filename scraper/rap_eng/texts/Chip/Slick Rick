[Intro: T.I.]
Ay!
It brings Grand Hustle a great pleasure to introduce to you fresh of his jet, man, across the pawn from London, my boy Chip, holla!

[Hook: Chip]
La Di Da Di, we likes to party
Bet the way I talk might attract somebody
Six foot tall, you can be my shawty
I swear down we don't wanna hurt nobody
Oh shit, I think I'm Slick Rick
Oh shit, call me Slick Rick
Oh shit, I think I'm Slick Rick
Hopped off a plane London Boy in this bitch (x2)

[Verse 1: Chip]
I speak the Queens' English
In my pocket, the Queens' head
I love America, but I'm English
You know it's Ben Franklin up in there
The girls love my accent when I come through
Word to fans I'm A/C cool
I love to party, raise the roof
Get dough or die, R-I-P you
Bottles keep coming, women do the same
Said she knows my song but she doesn't know my name
It's Chip (London Boy)
You know we in this bitch
Going blind like I cover my eyes, Slick Rick

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
You better tell them old rappers fall back
It's a new era word to my cap
Tell a hater you can miss me with the smack talk
Get you stamped out like my passport
Skin covered in ink, liver covered in drink, nigga fuck what you think
Party all night, yeah we about
Mayweather cush, knock a nigga out
My style, Team UK
Spanish girls love me like Enrique
So any time when I'm in M.I.A
I fly like paper, get high like planes

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Chip & (T.I.)]
Big women love me shit's crazy (Shit's dumb)
I got cash money for a baby ('Bout a ton)
Oh baby, oh baby baby
I can come on my own, even with your lady
La Di Da Di, we likes to party
Pull up like Ken, I'm just looking for a Barbie
Hustle Gang, we love James Bond
Call me Chip, Slick Rick or London Boy

[Hook]
