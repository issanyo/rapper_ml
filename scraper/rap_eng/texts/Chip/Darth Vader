[Hook]
Still young, still here, got waves ah
I ain't going bald or grey nah
Fuck 50 shades, man stay dark
Come through all black, Darth Vader
Star Wars, yeah man I had war with stars
Get dark swing my light saber
Some call me the grime scenes saviour
Test me nobody can save ya
Special like i'm born in a manger
Not new to danger, Got no behaviour
Red or blue pill, picked blue took 5
I just wanna touch mic and stay hard
So fuck these spitters and fuck their tracks
With similar beats and the same bars
Similar streets not the same path
Get whipped, get merked, man's A-Class

[Verse 1]
Touch mic with the truth and speak
Tell an MC tell the truth this week
You did not shoot this week
You was in the booth this week
Had a video shoot this week
Making tracks about 100 waps
100 shanks, 'llow it man
You ain't got war with a 100 man
You ain't no 300 spartan fam
These days if you're not chatting about crud
Then the yout dem don't want to hear it
Its for the yout them that i'm fearing
A generation without caring
Too many parents burying their kids
When kids should be burying parents
Man just wanna stay low and bank
Pray I never get shot or shanked

[Verse 2]
Yo, our father, thy kingdom come
On earth can't be like in heaven
So please give us our daily bread
All of these spitters getting daily stress
I write daily yes, Grime Daily yes
Wanna link up? Nah, on my anti? yes
Mad about bars from about 16
Mad about bars from, before you could count 16
Tell a bitch don't count on me, i'm no number line
It's Friday, now you wanna link up
Ahh, this week i'm her number 5
Tell me lies, yeah tell me lies
Sweet little ones
Strapped when I beat, I don't need little ones
She don't want more, she already got one
And she can't get preg swallowing cum
I get graphic, I'm a designer
She might hear this, but that's minor
'cause she rates my path she a rider
And she'd be down if I never had a fiver
But I just get rage some times
Start letting off rage on mic
Man if they cold what am I?
Whether I pick up a pen or write in my mind
No i'm not right in my mind and you're right on my mind
Alright you hopped on the track
Alright you're hot but you're wack
Sweep MCs with facts
Make them think about life
Let alone think about clash
Man get shelling, man don't want this unleaded
Don't come here for your gas
Man don't try it, man can't side with these liars
Man do nice with the facts
