[Verse 1: Giggs]
Time to get that profit all in
Won't rest 'til all my niggas rocket ballin'
I don't even think I stopped this mornin'
I'm that nigga that usually gets them what's-it-calleds in
I'm caught, when it's time to get that shoppin' sorted
Oh, this Armani blazer, bitch I got imported
Yeah I like that whip
Because I'm on the bands, only reason I ain't dropped that forty
Hot chicks see me on the streets and they stop and call me
Want me to get my willy out so they can toss it for me
Got 'em goin' topless for me
When she pop it for me, really got me horny
Record label contract, my lawyers got it for me
Dotted all the I's and the T's, can you cross 'em for me?
You can try and put your crosses on me
I don't watch hate, I got shooters that'll watch it for me

[Verse 2: Professor Green]
I'm heavy, I'm colder
Better me? No sir
I could tear apart MC's, but I'd rather read
A book on childcare by Kerry Katona
No niceness, I ran out of it, dumb it down a bit
Ain't somethin' I'm prepared to do
Well I ain't ever gonna run out of lip
Here's somethin' I prepared for you
I tried to relax
But being spaced it inspires me back
When will I be nice to Katie Price?
The day I see a cage fighter in drag, ah
I don't want a tomorrow without friction
Jump into beef both feet first
And make pros eat their words
And sit and watch 'em swallow their own dic-tion

[Verse 3: Tinie Tempah]
Uh, iSHi distort that bass
Man grew up on a raw estate
Now, everytime I draw my dates
They're like "How the fuck d'you afford this place?"
First place, first place, first place
Try act up, dem man will address that, call it
Put a fuckin' man in his place
Bitch I'm great, for goodness sake
I ain't gotta queue cause they know my face
Girls took my watch tryin' to wind up on me
I was like I ain't got time to waste, get it?
I ain't got time to waste, get it?
Try and get hype in my face, regret it
Got a big pitbull and I don't remember
The last time I fed it, so don't upset it

[Verse 4: Devlin]
Let me grieve for the beat before I murder it
Don't know my name? By now you should've heard of it
Why, cause I'm murderin' anybody lurking in
Close proximity, circlin'
Will make an example of men when I stride in
Dev's has got a tiny temper
I'm observing this, learning
But now I'm just yearning to burn it, I'll fire your agenda
Lock me up, might high risk offender
Make a man turn on his own team like an Irish defender
I'm a rhymin' inventor that's climbin' up heights you're not meant to
The game's over, so roll over
I'm sober, but I'll still kidnap a so called soldier
And bolt in the Rover to Dover
Yeah it's over, the game's over

[Verse 5: Example]
Put up your lighters, I clash the Titans
Fight the fighters, Mike fight the biters
Spit till my throat got tonsillitis
That's on a Monday mornin', ha
Takin' over, run straight past ya
No warnin', a real disaster
Harder, faster, stronger, longer
This one here was top of the classroom
Stop the lecture, drop the pressure
Never say never, but nevertheless I
Never say no to experiments
Whether it's tenements, clubs, yards, spittin' with eloquence
Positive sentiments
Havin' a hell of a time and it's evident
Don't question my relevance
I've started on this so I'm back in my element

[Verse 6: Chipmunk]
Uh, I open my mouth, niggas panic
The jewels are liabilities, mmm, I'm the asset
Underdogs are barkin' up, shh hush puppy
My new chain's got red and blue ice man
I call it my slush puppy
Yeah, let me clap 'em with the reminder flow
I was best newcomer, err, time ago
Yeah, you've all passed your sell by date to me
I'm different nigga, I sell out
When you add a venue and date to me

[Hook: Tinchy Stryder]
And now it's game over
Kick him out the team, I heard he's snaking, he's a cobra
Could have lived the dream but now your days are done, it's over
Should have never schemed and now your looking for a shoulder, to lean on
To wipe your tears on, it's over

[Verse 7: Tinchy Stryder]
They better let me go, let me loose
I'm frozen cold, my veins are blue
Hell to home, but it's Satan proof
Good as gold, my angels flew
Yo, they can't knock down mine
Cuffs on flows I lock down lines
I am not human, real life mutant
Ask Mick Foley, I'm not mankind
Yeah, look under my eyelids
All red, I bleed through the iris
Like I've been toking on weed, highest
Now my brain's on freeze, minus
Yeah I ain't letting it melt
I'm stark, haze, I'm letting it fill
Sideline this now separate that
I'm stayin here I ain't lettin' it gel, ill
