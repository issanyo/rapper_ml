[Hook: Chip]
Boy I got this in my genes keep a pocket full of trees
Course I’m flexing in my 20’s I was flexing in my teens
Pulled up said she wanna please, told her drop down to her knees
Never catch me out of pocket, nah I got this in my genes

[Verse 1: SL]
I still flex on the main roads
With a fuck off stud, you know how it goes
She a dangerous hoe, she don’t say no words
She says it all by the throat, stepped in the room two gorgeous hoes
I looked at bro he said he involved
Yeah I don’t cut no shapes but I cut mans face
Like wrong timing bro
Llight up this different tweed, yeah it come bitter but sweet
Tell my nigga take two off the price
He said alright, yeah he done man neat
Stunts on snap with the nice Louis V’s but it’s never nice when I spot those neeks
I looked at bro I said I like what he sees
He said he likes what he sees plus there’s two if he’s tryna be a g
Trap boy always got it on me
The packs come strong so they go with ease
The bop comes strong so she rolls with me

On a late night whipping up waves

Dsquared drop my jeans down
Smoking on a different tweed (wow)
Top was in a different league (ow)
