Verse 1
Chip) you can't run from us anymore
Looks like we got you surrounded
And since you don't have the money anymore
Looks like you are about to get pounded
Calvitron) bro, let's talk it out before we get violent
Chip) Alright, let's talk about putting this fool to silence
I brought my knife man did you bring one
Alyx Heater) oh yeah I did, too bad, I forgot my gun
Calvitron) come on bro you know it doesn't have to go down like this
Chip) The thing that's going down is your face to my fist
I hope that your good at putting up a good fight
Cause you have no idea what's going down tonight

Chorus (Calvitron)
Come over here and I'll punch you in the face
Punch you in the face, punch you in the face
But you know I just wanna get out of this place
Out of this place, out of this place
Come over here and I'll punch you in the face
Punch you in the face, punch you in the face
But you know I just wanna get out of this place
Out of this place, out of this place, so let's fight

Verse 2
Calvitron) Dodged an arrow punch and hit him right in the bow
He did a circle round and hit me right in the nose
Took a step back just to go get a setback
Got an elbow back in the other guys back
They both went over my head when the fists went in high
Hopefully, I can flight in the midst of all this fight
Got a meat balled fist that went straight to my gut
And I Got a gut feeling of where this is ending up
Did a spin and then I dodged a kick
And then my elbow met up with one of their fists
I hope everything tonight ends up alright
Cause I have no idea what’s going down tonight

Chorus

Verse 3
Calvitron) They pulled out their knives, so I pulled out mine
And we just stood there almost to the end of time
Then he took a swing but I dodged the thing
Then I a faint sound starting to ring
Then I went and ducked as it went passed my head
Then a thud came down as the knife went red
Chip) No no no NO NO NO  NO NO NO!
Wake Up, bro. Wake Up
You, it’s you that did this thing
Tell me why I shouldn’t kill you instantly
But looks like the police are going to do it for me
Now if I were you I’d probably start running

{Skit}
Dad: Now it just promotes violence and killing people! What kind of a book is this!

Kid: that guy is a meanie!

Dad: Yeah, let's just get this over with. Jonah became very scared as the police started to come. Trenton already disappeared from the area, and he was worried that they would think it was him that killed Dexter. He was also worried that they would search him and find what he had in his pocket. He didn’t want to get caught, so he started to run away from the police
