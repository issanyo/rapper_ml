[Intro: Chip]
Yeah, M.O
Chip

[Verse 1: Nadine & Chanal]
When I come, when I come home later
I'm just hoping you'll be awake yeah
When I come, when I come home later, ah ah ah, oh ah ah
Yeah, I know, yeah, I know you're patient
I don't wanna test your patience
I ain't lookin' for a new replacement, hmm ah ah, oh ah ah

[Pre-Chorus: Annie]
You say I'm on your mind
How come you don't make time, aah ah ah
You say I'm on your mind
But lately you showing me signs, aah ah ah

[Chorus: All (Annie & Chanal)]
Wondering, wondering
Been wondering, wondering where you go
Wondering, wondering
Been wondering, wondering where you
Been here like a million times
Right now, you're on a decline
Wondering, wondering
Been wondering, wondering where you go
(Where you go)
Wondering, wondering where you

[Verse 2: Chip]
Hittin' up my line, bad vibes when you text
I ain't with the stress, you got me hittin' up my ex
You ain't on my mind all the time, but you've been in my heart
Yo girl, you give me cardiac arrest
I ain't with pasa, the fussing and fighting
Sometimes people hear more in silence
You should be here right now with me vibin'
But you always on a hype ting
You be on WhatsApp saying that I'm giving you silence
I'm not the lollipop man, stop lying
I give you an inch but you wanna take a mile
It's not everyday, where was you last night?
She be Chippy, you take it too far
Asked where I was and I ran out of bars
For your loving, I was inclined
Now we on a decline
But it wasn't like this at the start

[Chorus: All (Annie & Chanal) [Nadine]]
Wondering, wondering
Been wondering, wondering where you go
Wondering, wondering
Been wondering, wondering where you
Been here like a million times
Right now, you're on a decline
Wondering, wondering
Been wondering, wondering where you go
Wondering, wondering where you
Wondering, wondering where you

[Bridge: Chanal & Annie]
I don't want no karma
So I'ma treat you proper
I don't want no drama
So I'ma treat you proper
I don't want no karma
So I'ma treat you proper
I don't want no drama
But lately you showing me signs ah

[Chorus: All]
Wondering, wondering
Been wondering, wondering where you go
Wondering, wondering
Been wondering, wondering where you
Been here like a million times
Right now, you're on a decline
Wondering, wondering
Been wondering, wondering where you go
Wondering, wondering where you
Wondering, wondering where you
