[Hook: Chipmunk]
I'm looking for a Asian girl tonight
We know that it's wrong but we make it right
Take her to my room, cut out the lights
It's just me and my Asian girl tonight

[Verse 1: Skepta]
I'm looking for an Asian princess wearing a sari
They call me the first black Raja so I'm in here tryna find a Rani
There's too many 10 out of 10s in here
Yo Jasmine pass me the car key
Let's all go back to my house right now and have a mehendi party
I brought so many drinks in here the clubs stinking of gun powder
If you feelin' it like I'm feelin' it say "DJ turn it up louder"
I picked up the microphone and told the club that we're leaving in an hour
Now the ladies looking for me like Mario's looking for Bowser

[Hook: Chipmunk]
I'm looking for a Asian girl tonight
We know that it's wrong but we make it right
Take her to my room, cut out the lights
It's just me and my Asian girl tonight
I'm looking for a Asian girl tonight
We know that it's wrong but we make it right
Take her to my room, cut out the lights
It's just me and my Asian girl tonight

[Verse 2: Chipmunk]
She looking at me like a box of chocolates it's standard celebration
So many Asian girls love me, might start to pin the nation
I got my swagger right
Let's have a bangin' night
I mix the bhangra with the bashment I'mma bang it right
She said her faith is deep yo
I told her I ain't too religious but I seek doe
Hence I found you
You show me Asian sensation then I'll show you round two

[Hook: Chipmunk]
I'm looking for a Asian girl tonight
We know that it's wrong but we make it right
Take her to my room, cut out the lights
It's just me and my Asian girl tonight
I'm looking for a Asian girl tonight
We know that it's wrong but we make it right
Take her to my room, cut out the lights
It's just me and my Asian girl tonight
