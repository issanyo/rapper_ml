[Hook: Nafe Smallz]
Smokin', woo!
I told her I'm smokin', smokin'
I told her I was a smoker
And this shit just ain't no joke
I got my weed in my swisher
I make you choke, I make you choke
Woo! Only weed
In my swisher, in my swisher
I been smoking, I'm so lean, lean
And everywhere we go we keep that blunt
That loud, that pack man
You know that I'm smokin' weed

[Verse 1: Chip]
You know that I smoke my weed
Ain't no emcees smoking me
Mum keeps praying that I put this down
I just went quiet, gotta hit this loud
Sharp lines if I hit a blunt, that's true
And I'm plotting and scheming, I bill up a zoot
Niggas are waiting, replies in the queue
Till I get my pen and my pad and a Q
You can see I'm sure, still waving
Punked out before, now I'm grading
Niggas want a verse, might turf 'em
I'll do one for Nafe, cuh he wavy (My G)
These niggas ain't on my wave, niggas ain't got my wave
I told her I smoke, ain't nothing like a zoot and brain
Make you choke, make you choke
Pre-roll, hit the road
Wifey me, I said no
It's Cash Motto you ho
Backstrapping of course
Ain't a blue slim then it's Raw
Lemon Sativa, Cheese, Amnesia
Trust me I been through 'em all (I smoke)

[Hook: Nafe Smallz]
Smokin', woo!
I told her I'm smokin', smokin'
I told her I was a smoker
And this shit just ain't no joke
I got my weed in my swisher
I make you choke, I make you choke
Woo! Only weed
In my swisher, in my swisher
I been smoking, I'm so lean, lean
And everywhere we go we keep that blunt
That loud, that pack man
You know that I'm smokin' weed

[Verse 2: Black The Ripper]
They say I'm the UK's Wiz Khalifa
Or the UK's Snoop Dogg, but
I was smoking way before I knew who Wiz was
Ain't a joke ting, take two hits of this, I bet you'll all be choking
So much THC, these frosty nugs'll make you think it's snowing
Grab a cone and put a O in
I grow it so I could blow it
Dank of England CEO
See me if you need these O's
Ganja farmer, plus I'm a poet
Say you got dank? Let me see then, show it
Everyone knows I got it
I'm in Europe but I'm smoking exotic
I'm a winner
Sativa for breakfast, Indica for lunch and dinner
Windows up, hotboxing a Bimmer
Smoke where I want these feds are too inner
Fuck the Queen, and the government
Legalise the green, they're mugging it
They say Mary Jane ruins your brain
That's a lie, my life's great and I'm loving it

[Hook: Nafe Smallz]
Smokin', woo!
I told her I'm smokin', smokin'
I told her I was a smoker
And this shit just ain't no joke
I got my weed in my swisher
I make you choke, I make you choke
Woo! Only weed
In my swisher, in my swisher
I been smoking, I'm so lean, lean
And everywhere we go we keep that blunt
That loud, that pack man
You know that I'm smokin' weed
