[Verse 1: Jeswon]
Yo way back when, before I started rappin' with Tuk
It was you and I hangin' at the back of the bus
We had blunt wraps packin' with buds
But you swapped them for those white lines rackin' em' up
Whatever happened to us?
We never dreamed of going platinum with plush leather seats in the Jeeps yeah the shit, it didn't matter to us
We were happy with a packet of darts
In your old man's car steady havin' a laugh
But times change, you chose to go the corporate route
It's awkward now, we ain't got shit to talk about
You wanted to get paid kid go ahead do it
You thought it was stupid how we chose to make music
But now the fans lose it, you finally understand
That despite never seeing you, you're still my brother man
It'll stay that way until the end of time, shit
And you're the reason that I sketch this rhyme
I got love

[Hook: Jase Excell]
Hey how you doing?
How you been?
Shouldn't be this hard to say what I mean
I've been doing okay, I've been doing my thing
Been going my way been chasing the dream
(Hey)
Hey how you doing?
How you been?
Shouldn't be this hard to say what I mean
I've been doing okay, I've been doing my thing
Been going my way been chasing the dream
(Yeah yeah yeah)
(Yeah yeah yeah)
(Yeah yeah yeah yeah)
(Yeah yeah yeah)
(Yeah yeah yeah)
(Yeah yeah)
(Chasing the dream)

[Verse 2: Tuka]
Change is the only constant, from the offset
When shit gets switched up, it pays to know the concept
Though the prospect to perceptive for what it is
When tension is prominent, you best wanna ponder this
Often, friendship, drifts in the opposite direction
To positive unless you acknowledge it
Take steps to honour it, shit
I remember us as just a couple wretched snotty kids
In our younger days used to jump a train
Underlay underlay, if a guard come run away
When you come of age some things can't stay the same
It's safe to say you became a hard mate to face
And I ain't dissin' your world view
I happen to understand about how
You can catch me standing on that other planet as well
Dammed to a cell, bitch about my music
This verse is for you, even if you never listen to it

[Hook: Jase]
Hey how you doing?
How you been?
Shouldn't be this hard to say what I mean
I've been doing okay, I've been doing my thing
Going my way then chasing the dream
(Hey)
Hey how you doing?
How you been?
Shouldn't be this hard to say what I mean
I've been doing okay, I've been doing my thing
Going my way then chasing the dream
(Yeah yeah yeah)
(Yeah yeah yeah)
(Yeah yeah yeah yeah)
(Yeah yeah yeah)
(Yeah yeah yeah)
(Yeah yeah)
(Chasing the dream)

[Outro: Jewson and Tuka]
Seasons change, mad things rearrange
I haven’t seen you in ages
Here’s to the memories that made me put pen to paper
It's strange when best friends become strangers
Seasons change, mad things rearrange
I haven’t seen you in ages
Here’s to the memories that made me put pen to paper
It's strange when best friends become strangers
