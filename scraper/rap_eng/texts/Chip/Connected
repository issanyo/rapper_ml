[Intro: Eric Bellinger]
This gon' be your favourite song

[Hook: Eric Bellinger]
She said "take me on a plane with you
It don't even matter where we headed
I just wanna get away with you
Cause I know that you can teach me a thing or two"
Connected
She already know I'm connected
I'm the only one she wanna mess with
She know my whole squad is connected, connected, yeah

[Verse 1: Chip]
I'm well-connected, well-respected
The only queue I know is weed, eff a guest list
I drop my big chain for a necklace
But smelling good and looking good still on the checklist
She said "you're drunk, right?" Nah, I'm high, boo
I'm high as fuck like shit, it's my tune
So when the time's right, I make the right move
She smell my neck like "that ain't Chanel Bleu"
So ayy, you know my new shit, but y'all be on some new shit
Taking out some rappers on they haven't got a clue shit
Me, I'm on my cool shit, never tryna prove shit
Looking arse niggas always look and never do shit
Hold up, London Boy, I feel like booking a flight
Cali, kush and Hollywood nights
Worldwide, I catch a vibe
You could put that on my life or just put me on the mic, turn up

[Hook: Eric Bellinger]
She said "take me on a plane with you
It don't even matter where we headed
I just wanna get away with you
Cause I know that you can teach me a thing or two"
Connected
She already know I'm connected
I'm the only one she wanna mess with
She know my whole squad is connected, connected, yeah

[Verse 2: Chip]
I like to party, she like to party
We like to party, true
Ayo wasteman, you ain't made no money this week
What you doing at the party? Move
Bun fuss and fighting, I'm worldwide vibesing
Ty booked a flight, he bussed out on a Dubai ting
Too many man are on some real tough guy ting
Bun that, smooth thing, fly ting, my ting
Listen, I know your ting but you don't know my ting
If you've got the cake, cool, Chippy got the icing
Talk long, niggas smile when I see I'm shining
Calm in a Hublot, I took off all my diamonds
London Boy, I'm tryna do it for the buff tings
Tell me drop more bangers, that's a done ting
So I'm ghost putting work in in the booth
You don't see me in the club, boy, I bet you hear my tunes

[Hook: Eric Bellinger]
She said "take me on a plane with you
It don't even matter where we headed
I just wanna get away with you
Cause I know that you can teach me a thing or two"

I'm the only one she wanna mess with
She know my whole squad is connected, connected, yeah

[Bridge: Chip]
I like to party, she likes to party

What you saying, girl? You getting stressed in the ends?
Let's book a flight, me and you
Tell me what you're saying, tell me where you wanna go
Wanna roll with me cause she know I'm on a roll
Who out your friends ain't rating the team
When we tell 'em let 'em go, let 'em go, let 'em go?
