A wise man told me persevere
To elevate me in my career
So still I'm here

The birthday wishing they woulda blew if they woulda listened
And now were gone (they're gone) they're missing (big loss)
Big Difference

Ask wassup like you can't see me (im at the top)

Holla at me if ya need me

Look for me
See im the one to look for
You ain't gotta look far
Look forward
I'm there
Prey da light , the clothes fit clothes prey the swaggers
I work hard like stuff the haters
Took all the stairs no escalators
And my pen kept on passing papers
When another artists wouldn't pass a favour
Cold When I Needed One
I'm a Star how you feeling son?
Trying to keep bringing them hits
Cause my dreams got legs so im chasing it
