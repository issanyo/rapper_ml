[Intro: Chip & MIST]
Ain't' a lifestyle that I would rather
Look into my eyes see...
Just made a banger with Sevaqk, (Uh, huh)
Bill another one forget the drama
Looks into my eyes see Marijuana, yeah

[Chorus: Chip]
Ain't a lifestyle that I would rather
Look into my eyes see Marijuana, yeah
Roll another one forget the drama
Look into my eyes see Marijuana, yeah
Ain't' a lifestyle that I would rather
Look into my eyes see Marijuana
Roll another one forget the drama
Look into my eyes see Marijuana, yeah

[Verse: Chip]
Man ain't got it like this, man ain't wavy like chip
I get Cali' through the post, I book a flight for a spliff
It's a friday night off, I might holla my ting
I might want a night out, I might want a night in
Im just doing my ting, see me flex see me gwan
Man this industry's a hype, man this ganja keep me calm
Say your smoking flavours, whats that, lemon? nah I'm calm
Baby I don't smoke the citrus only pass if its gelat's
Sevaqk up on the riddim, catch the pocket then I fit 'em
Man the game's just a spliff course it needs a little Chip in
Why the fuck you think I'm billin, smokin thinking whippin riddims
On my life i'll never stop till I see all my brudda's winning
Light a zoot say a prayer Lord forgive me I've been sinning
Getting lit' with different women, its been lit' from the beginning
Penthouse suite, couple buffers and my niggas
We ain't running out of visions wheres the rizla come we bill it

[Chorus: Chip]
Ain't' a lifestyle that I would rather
Look into my eyes see Marijuana, yeah
Roll another one forget the drama
Look into my eyes see Marijuana, yeah
Ain't' a lifestyle that I would rather
Look into my eyes see Marijuana
Roll another one forget the drama
Look into my eyes see Marijuana, yeah

[Verse: MIST]
Yeah my vision was mad (mad)
I turned dreams to a plan
Fuck feds, win a mobo in the can (pricks)
Flavours like Dam (ssh)
Always on point fuck Xans (uh)
Stress turned me from a boy to a man (real)
Labbing all night yeah you know where im at (prang)
Cali got me zoning and that
Sit back, blow smoke with my Ahk' (pfft)
Brum on the map (ah)
Brumie' Karla is back
Get aggy, Get daft
In school yeah i own it like maths (huh)
Got kicked out straight juggin and trap (skrr)
Lived in my whip, sluggish and that
Now its a airport ting, no luggage, just cash (gone)
Just dash, Man get money real fast (what)
Choppin overseas and splash
No luggage, Just dash (ah)
Man get money real fast
Choppin overseas and splash

[Chorus: Chip]
Ain't' a lifestyle that I would rather
Look into my eyes see Marijuana, yeah
Roll another one forget the drama
Look into my eyes see Marijuana, yeah
Ain't' a lifestyle that I would rather
Look into my eyes see Marijuana
Roll another one forget the drama
Look into my eyes see Marijuana, yeah
