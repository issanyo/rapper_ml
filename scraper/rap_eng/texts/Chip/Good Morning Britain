[Verse 1]:
Yo, working on my album, this the last song I made
Got me thinking what I stand for and how far I came
Money, drugs, beef and guns man the ends will never change
These days, it ain’t even safe staying in your lane
Cah' the hood gon' be the hood
You shouldn’t ever judge if you ain’t lived there
If bullets flying, you ain’t been there
Listen up, changed from sitting down, talking would be awesome
Nah, fuck Piers Morgan
I know mothers mourning
There's kids ain't going school and girls are getting shot and dying
So immune to the issues in a borough like mine
When your family’s in the ends and your manor's in beef
Look on any road could be the wrong place wrong time, uh
You hear of Tottenham and you think of Harry Kane
I hear of Tottenham and I think of hella pain
They told me music or football could be the course out
True how, it ain’t on sky sports when they score now
Fuck a interview, I don’t wanna sit and talk 'bout how I feel
Innocent girl gone, you call that one nil
Got me flabbergasted like: "Oh that's how you feel?"
You the type of person probably say I ain’t real
When you spread the truth, they wanna see you slapped
Niggas wake up everyday, but they ain’t woke, they're tapped
Man are dissing on the high road, they had me dissing back
But my daddy always told me that’s your brother if he black
Say it loud, mans black and I’m proud
Please don’t call me no lighty, I am very James Brown
Don’t ask me what are the solutions for the town
Everybody going vegan ain’t no beef dying down

[Pre-Chorus]
And that’s real shit
Niggas killing niggas, still there’s racism to deal with
Puffin on my zoot, I hit the booth and spit the realness
We can elevate with love and unity
Views overseas thinking 'bout my community

[Chorus]
Man I pray a change gonna come
No it ain’t safe where I’m from
Niggas only feel safe with a gun
When is change gonna come
I don’t wanna raise my kids somewhere anywhere like where I'm from
Pray a change gonna come
No it ain’t safe where I’m from
Niggas only feel safe with a gun *Gunshot* *Sirens*
And I don’t wanna raise my kids 'round violence, sirens, this ain’t life

[Verse 2]:
Let me open up your mind
Stab or be stabbed pick a side of the knife
You ain’t see it like that right?
I can’t be going mad when even innocents are dying
Van Gogh with it boy I paint a picture with the rhymes
I don’t know what the fuck that you thought
London had more Ms in a month than New York
See anywhere I step, I say a prayer before I walk
The city’s always been nuts but it weren't this mad before
I look around, the kids are going off the rails
You can’t only blame the music, call of duty's still for sale
Heaven sent, rappers lying to the kids give 'em hell
I only offend rappers who been lying to themselves yeah
Sometimes I wanna be a father, then I don’t
Cah' when I look around, it’s like humanity is ghost
The era of the iPhone, there isn’t any hope
See you dead, open snapchat, before they check your pulse
Let the rhymes fly, would the world be better without WiFi
My brother coming home, if feels like time flies
Where did 4 years go, where did all the care go
These niggas wanna air max, see me I wanna air flows
Over the perceptions, and false conceptions
They scorn you when you move out, that’s the objective
But we’ve been oppressed with council estate morals
Where between pride and violence
Man dead over a squabble, uh
Now it’s RIP pics and go fund me’s
Years past and niggas ain’t checking on your mumzy
Young people dying, let me get my pen now
Like I pray I don't get Malcom or triple X'd out

[Pre-Chorus]
And that’s real shit
Niggas killing niggas, still there’s racism to deal with
Puffin on my zoot, I hit the booth and spit the realness
We can elevate with love and unity
Views overseas thinking 'bout my community

[Chorus]
Man I pray a change gonna come
No it ain’t safe where I’m from
Niggas only feel safe with a gun
When is change gonna come
I don’t wanna raise my kids somewhere anywhere like where I'm from
Pray a change gonna come
No it ain’t safe where I’m from
Niggas only feel safe with a gun *Gunshot*  *Sirens*
And I don’t wanna raise my kids 'round violence, sirens, this ain’t life yeah
