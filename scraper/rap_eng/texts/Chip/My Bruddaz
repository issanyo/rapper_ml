Yep yep light show, ya dun know, my bruddaz
Good fellas from the ends, my bruddaz
Haters can't stand us cause gyal love us

Dem man got no vibes or bangers
Kill off a show like bap bap bap
Cuh promoters know I got one bag of bangers

Grime through most Roleys and stoneys
God said that he got me, I said coldly
Anyone I've done favours don't owe me

We bring a vibe, don't know about the others
I make a straight forward path for my bruddaz
Still here, you ain't heard the last of my bruddaz
You already know when I get a big dough
I'm gonna keep my part, give half to my bruddaz
Yeah, that's how we function
So don't run up your gums with assumptions
Man wanna type type now
But ends are small, might see each other at a junction
Squad's like "show me where the beef is"
I replied "let me show you where the Ps are"
Think the States wanna give me that Visa
Take my vibe to the hood where the Gs are

Get in the way, get moved

Stoneys, man are bossy, that's my bruddaz
Dun know man a run road with my bruddaz
