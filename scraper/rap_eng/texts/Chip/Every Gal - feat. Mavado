Tell dem say de stulla, I never cake up
Clean every day mi wake up

Tell dem say de stulla, I never cake up
There ain't a bulletproof needed for none of these shots
And can I get a Baileys on the rocks?
Swagga turned all the way up
No sparkles on that champagne 'cause we don't give a
Heaven sent bringin' hell too
She smelling my neck, that's Chanel Bleu
Table full of goons, still got plenty room
Do they smile? Gully side boo
But everybody's cool
She said she's got a man, I'm Mister Break The Rules
Like just imagine all the things that we can do
Man, he let you out dressed so seductive, he's a fool
Face looking all sweet
Grinding on me like she looking for a beat
Yeah, wave your sober, we every gyal a madova

Every gyal a mad, said dem want di god
Tell dem say de stulla, I never cake up
Gyal a tear off mi garment
And a bawl fi come in a mi apartment
She said my swagga's so alarming
I told her, wake up and do not miss your chance then
All eyes are on we, plain black fitted tee
Are these true religions? No, Laguna beach
I'm 6 foot, she short and sweet
And, yeah, I'm kinda famous, what we call Gully creep
Cool dude, so subtle
She got a crystal like a gold bottle
She whispered in my ear she wants me in her archive
So I told her, back it up, hard drive
Face looking all sweet
Grinding on me like she looking for a beat
Yeah, wave your sober we every gyal a madova

The ladies, they love me, they love me, I'm the youngest general
Got so much to live for they could never see my funeral
[Incomprehensible] Criminal
She [Incomprehensible] my spot because my booties like a mineral
Chipmunk, bring the car, boy
The girl dem love we 'cause dem know suh we a star, boy
I'm a soldier, ain't no fucking toy boy
