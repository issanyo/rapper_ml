[Hook]
I'm ridin' with that thumper
All about my money
Laughin' to the bank
But ain't shit funny
Who that on my nuts?
That's just your baby Mama
Flyer than a fuck
You boys ??? La Bamba
Flyer than a fuck
You boys ??? La Bamba
Oh who that on my nuts?
That's just your baby Mama
Laughin' to the bank
But ain't shit funny
Ridin' with that thumper
All about my money

[Verse 1]
Say my name 3 times like Beetlejuice
Comin' through your mirror make it clearer just to see if you
That guy
If so, I will let that heater shoot
Kush so loud, lit it up and my speakers blew
Monster in my pocket like Ash keep Pikachu
Just popped a ??? on these hoes
And you know these sneakers new
I just wanna fuck shorty
I don't wanna be with you
Married to the money
Ain't no way that it ??? me and you
I can make it visual
Homey, if it's feasible
See me hittin' corners in them European vehicles
Smokin' that exotic I'm fresher than an Easter suit
Fuckin' on that rag? Oh don't be mad if I don't speak to you
Oh shit, you got pills?
That's ironic I'm geeking too
And your girl wanna join, I'm fuckin' each of you
You think you Big Meech?
I'm thinkin' that I'm Big Meech too
There's a thousand motherfuckers out here think they Big Meech too

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Say my muthafuckin' name and you gonna get ya mouth blew out
Big bad wolf, yep might just get your house blew down
Throw my Jason mask on
Represent for hockeytown
Illuminati getting money dammit how can I get down
Bet you couldn’t hang with these type of niggas I be around
Boy they out here slangin' that same shit that fucked up Bobby Brown
O.M.G., you niggas talking violence now?
Bop bop bop muthafucka that’s how I get down
I ain’t catching nobody no it ain’t no body found
Make or miss shawdy
Let me dick ya body down
Oh you got a man?
Call me when he not around
Girl I’ll beat that muthafucka out of bounds
Niggas talk a lot of shit
Only when I’m not around
I’ll pop the trunk spray the chopper til it’s out of rounds
Niggas wasn’t bout it then niggas ain’t bout it now
Just bought the block next year I'mma buy the town
