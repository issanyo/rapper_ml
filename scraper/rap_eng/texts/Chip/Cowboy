Cowboy, cowboy
Riding in a rodeo
Can I be the one for you
Cowboy, cowboy
Called my little romeo
Let me be your cowgirl too
When I see you

And ride on a horse
Let me be the one for you
And every time look at you
I'm hoping that you will looking at me too
And every time I'm dreaming of you
I'm hoping that my dream will be come trought

When the sun set the prairie on fire
Wil he be the one for me
Lord is burning you lied of eye

And every time I see your smile
You make me smile at you too
And every time you make me wild
I'm hoping that my dream come trought
Chorus 2x
Cowboy, cowboy
Riding in a rodeo
Can I be the one for you cowboy, cowboy
Called my little romeo
Let me be you cowgirl too
Let me be your cowgirl too
Let me be your cowgirl too
