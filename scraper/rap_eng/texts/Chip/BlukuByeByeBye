Diss the ting, get bluku bye bye bye bye
Chat my name, get bluku bye bye bye bye
Run your mout, get bluku bye bye bye bye
Run man out like bluku bye bye bye bye
Negative energy, negative vibes
Don't need that, bluku bye bye bye bye
I've got the energy, I've got the vibes
Don't try and get bluku bye bye bye bye

[Verse 1]
Bye, came back around, talk of the town
I'm who the UK's talking about
I told them I'm Cassius Clay with the pen but
They ain't hear me till now
Taking digs, carry on digging
Divs, look at the diamond you've found
I don't wanna hear no chat about Chris and Rihanna
That's late, I'll pen a man down
Man down, man down, champion all sounds
Get a wheel right now, that's how I feel right now
Don't care about a deal right now
The system can't pattern me out
Or pattern me down, I'll pattern these clowns
They tried block my path, I built my own
Ya dun know, better start patterning now

[Hook]
Diss the ting, get bluku bye bye bye bye
Chat my name, get bluku bye bye bye bye
Run your mout, get bluku bye bye bye bye
Run man out like bluku bye bye bye bye
Negative energy, negative vibes
Don't need that, bluku bye bye bye bye
I've got the energy, I've got the vibes
Don't try and get bluku bye bye bye bye

[Verse 2]
Them man there all vanishing
Them man there all panicking
Them man there on some fashion ting
They ain't MCs, they're mannequins
I see bare man's pics on 'Gram like
That's not swag, that's weird
I don't wanna sit down looking at clothes
That I know that I will not wear
Gave away bare of my jewels right now
My mind's on a next ting
Still see me in the west end, hanging with Joe
And the Hublot, owner flexing
The MOBOs dissed me and got a blazing
GRAMMY winners in my inbox rating
My big bro went jail and my dad had a son
I ain't sorry for the time I was taking
I told the mandem trust me
But some of them didn't trust me
Cuh where I come from, we get taught
Don't trust someone who says "trust me"
But I still got this, trust me
Now you're thinking, do you trust me?
Trust me, should've trusted me
My heart's clean, trust me

Diss the ting, get bluku bye bye bye bye

I've got the energy, I've got the vibes
Don't try and get bluku bye bye bye bye
