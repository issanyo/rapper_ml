[Hook]
Bitch I'm on, Bitch I'm on, B-B-B-Bitch (ay ay, ay ay ay) Bitch I'm on B-B-B-Bitch (ay ay, ay ay ay) Bitch I'm on B-B-B-Bitch (ay ay) I said bitch I'm on

[Verse 1: Chip$]
Go ahead and flip the light switch up
My pockets fat, yo shit like a white bitch butt
Ask yo bitch if she like Chip$, "yup"
Had her at the crib and she likes it rough
Oh yeah that hoe want her hair yanked
I got a gun big enough to make a bear faint
I think I'm Godzilla, King Kong
Kickin' in ya door, no ding dong (ding dong)
Bitch, I'm so on (on), I put my team on (on)
Climbed off (off), ya bitch then put my team on (on)
You think you fuckin' with me? (me?), nigga dream on (on)
I put yo ass to sleep, turn your dreams on
T-t-t-turn that shit into a nightmare
All black with the ski mask, night wear
Bitch look good I'll pull her (polar), white bear
Kush got a nigga solar, light year

[Hook x2]

[Verse 2: Chip$]
And you niggas can't turn me off
Turned ya bitch on, now I can't turn her off
That shit I put ya bitch on got her takin' off
Them same clothes she put on, she's now takin' off
(Oh that's yo) Oh that's yo baby mama?
Damn, just the neighborhood basement runner
Had niggas lined up, takin' numbers
On the way out she talkin' 'bout "Chip$, take my number"
(That bitch!) Bitch you better take a hike
If yo feet sore, bitch, you better take a bike
Fuck my money up, bitch, you better make it right
You ain't got shit left, bitch, you better make it right
Be cool rapper, I ain't tryin' to take ya ice
I'm tryin' to take ya spot
Bitch, I'll take ya life
You need to fuck with me, I stay takin' flights
I'll give yo never had nothin' ass a taste of life
