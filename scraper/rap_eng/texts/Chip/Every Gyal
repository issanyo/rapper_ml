[Hook: Mavado]
Clean every day mi wake up, chain pon mi neck ah Jacob
Every gyal a mad, say dem waan di gaad
Tell dem say di stulla, I never cake up

[Verse 1: Chipmunk]
There ain't a bulletproof needed for none of these shots
And can I get a Baileys on the rocks?
Swagga turned all the way up
No sparkles on that champagne cause we don't give a fuck
Heaven sent, bringing hell too
She smelling my neck, that's Chanel Bleu
Table full of goons, still got plenty room
Do they smile, gully side boo
But everybody's cool
She said she's got a man, I'm mister break the rules
Like just imagine all the things that we can do
Man, he let you out dressed so seductive, he a fool
Face looking all sweet, grinding on me like she looking for a beat
Wavy or sober we every gyal ya mad ova, colder

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Chipmunk]

Gyal a tear off mi garment
And a bawl fi come in a my apartment
She said my swagga's so alarming
I told her wake up and do not miss your chance then
Let's go, all eyes are on we
Plain black fitted tee
Are these True Religions, no, Laguna Beach
I'm 6 foot, she's short and sweet
And yeah I'm kinda famous, but we caan gully creep
Cool dude, so subtle
She got a crystal like a gold bottle
She whispered in my ear she wants me in her archive
So I told her back it up, hard drive
Face looking all sweet, grinding on me like she looking for a beat
Wavy or sober, we every gyal ya mad ova, colder

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Mavado]
The ladies, they love me, they love me
I'm the youngest general, got so much to live for they could never see my funeral
Me tek weh bwoy gyal, man ah gyal criminal,
She knocked at my spot because my food is like the mineral
Chipmunk, bring the car boy
The gyal dem love we cuz dem know say we are a star bwoy
I'm a soldier, ain't no fuckin toy boy
Seize a do it and you can take it to the law boy
