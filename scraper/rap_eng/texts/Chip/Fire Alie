Yo, I'm fire alie
League of my own, that's fire alie
Couple other youts are doing this ting
But when they hear me, they're like "Fire alie"
Like yeah, yeah, Chipmunk's fire alie
League of my own, that's fire alie
Couple other youts are doing this ting
But when they hear me, they're like "Fire alie"
Like sho sho, Chipmunk's fire alie
Non stop blaze, then I'm fire alie
Couple kids get excited and try clash man
I rate them though, cause they dove, but tried
Yeah, I rate them though, cause they flowed, but tried
I'm humble and cool but say what I like
If you don't like me don't be a bitch about it
Cause I hate it when the likkle mans lie
I'm Chip Diddy Chip, I'm fire alie
Back in the day, I'd lock into danger
Heard D Double spit birds in the sky
But now I level up with the birds in the sky
I'm a new school lyrical down on the mic
The older MCs must hear me and fear me
Why? Cause they know what I'm like
The new kid on the block that everybody likes
I'm Chip Diddy Chip, I'm fire alie
These likkle manz don't want it with the gang
I'm nang, dun know I'm a lord of the mic
And no, I was not on Lord of the Mics
But know that if I was on Lord of the Mics
Someone would've been overly pissed
I'm overly sick, I'm fire alie
I'm fire alie, I'm fire alie
Chat shit then I ride on a guy
From day I've been in a league of my own
So no other youts can shine when I rhyme
These other kids wanna write how I write
But they know that they can't write how I write
I got a piff book, they got a shit book
How can they be fire alie?
Alie, they're not fire
They're just liars, me, I'm fire alie
Me nah pick to tell a sound boy what I like
And I always get what I want
So padlock your girl if she's what I like
Padlock your girl if she's what I like
Watch her see C and see what she likes
If she spend one night with I
She'd be like Chipmunk's fire alie
He's fire alie, he's fire alie
I write bars and stay up, hook then pay up
This grime scene is a grind
Manaman not spit for free, that's a hype
If you heard that I spit for free, that's a lie
No cash by the hour, just cash by the line
But anyway back to the concept
You know me, I'm fire alie
I'm fire alie, I'm fire alie
They say they're fire, I say they're liars
Besides music, trust me I do this
More times, me, I'll be out on the grind
'Ang tight, the UK garage and grime
UK I rep, that's me when I rhyme
Chipmunk, I'm in a league of my own
Sho sho sho, I'm fire alieee
Yeah
