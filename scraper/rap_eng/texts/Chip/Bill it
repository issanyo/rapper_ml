[Verse 1: Big Narstie]
Ooverman, Ooverman
Industry like scooberman
Pick up dirt like hoover
Bring my ting in uber
Aim at your medulla
You won't see the shooter man
Bravo, do you know, what I did to be the man?
Fat peter pan, used that millimeter read your meter (man)
Teachers said I wouldn't be shit but from pizzaman
I was on the strip, with that zip moving reefa man
Old school shit, Bobby Johnson with her beefer man
BDL, Dank of England, 420 gang
Super orange, I'm no novice, I'm the teacher man
Boss of bosses, homie you never meet the man
Fucking chief got the cheek to even see the man

[Verse 2: Chip]
Are you on it fam? Course I'm on it (obviously)
Grab my weed turn on the mic, niggas don't want it
Couple years back I was down
Like how the fuck I spin it 'round
Turn on me I spin you 'round
And around
And around (blood clot)
Now this nigga's looking dizzy
I'm the rascal in my city (Raskit)
No boo dinners, me black and slim
We just at the table talking Lizzy (mulah)
'member me I've been about (facts)
Too much ammy shut your mouth (dickhead)
Cali kush I'm in the clouds, in the clouds, in the clouds
I can't fuck with these bozos
Cause to spit her I don't go gos
When it comes to that Cali Kush I know tommy ghosts and lobos
My niggas trappin' for they p's
They told me money grows on trees
I said a tenner's plastic you mean
You zummi, you zeen (Chippy)

[Verse 3: Black The Ripper]
You know I'm on it fam, everyday I'm high
Mr light up everywhere, I smoke my weed wherever I like
When I'm bored, I book a flight
Then breeze off to wherever I like
Going broke? That's a joke, I get p's whenever I like
When I said money grows on trees
My teachers said I'm having a laugh
Now I get more than their yearly wages off these cannabis plants
Yeah I got some cannabis farms (Where?)
From London to Durham, got the UK covered
Haters fuck 'em, these snakes I don't trust 'em
I just bill it fam, you know me I'm in the damn
Rolling up the piffest grams
Post a pic on instagram
Smoke with Chip yeah that's my fam
Big Narstie yeah that's gang
We stay high all day and night, Dank of England that's the brand. Might just pull up in your town, might just pull up in your city
Yeah I got so many haters but none of them are fucking with me. Yeah I smoke so many flavors, but I keep it high and strictly
DOE gang we the new age hippies, pretty girls wanna come blaze with me?

[Chorus: Smasher]
Are you on it fam, yes you know I'm on it. (yeah I'm on it)
