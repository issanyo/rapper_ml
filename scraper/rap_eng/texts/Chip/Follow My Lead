[Verse 1: Chipmunk]
Hi world, what's poppin'?
Tryna fuck the game, they just cock blockin
Aiming for the top and I am not stopping
They gassed up and I'm balloon poppin
Real leader. need help, holla me
Caaah if twitter had a twitter I bet it would follow me
Chyeaah, feel the presence when I come through
New or old, I run school

[Bridge: Chipmunk]
And I was never blinded by the lights
But I've always had stars in my eyes
So whether open or closed my vision's in line
And maybe that's the reason why

[Chorus: Eric B]
I'm one step ahead of you, you never catch up to me
Everybody else is just following me
So just follow my lead, you can follow my lead
I'mma star I'll show you the way [x2]

[Verse 2: Chipmunk]
Cheaah, try test me on stage, you'll be left burning
I kill bills, Uma Thurman
You get tired diorrns, I get lie-in morns
You don't think you're the best, why you lying for?
Cleaning up caah been a mess
Me, I never rest. I'm rest-less
I'm F up you sex-less
The vocabs are stubbing
Popstar p.s wordsmith I'm killing it
Gimme 25, then imagine my level when I'm 25- scary times
Mc's on my level there's none
I don't feel anyone I'm nummmbb

[Bridge: Chipmunk]
And I was never blinded by the lights
But I've always had stars in my eyes
So whether open or closed my vision's in line
And maybe that's the reason why

[Chorus: Eric B]
I'm one step ahead of you, you never catch up to me
Everybody else is just following me
So just follow my lead, you can follow my lead
I'mma star I'll show you the way [x2]

[Verse 3 - Chipmunk]
Yeah and I'mma come up there with running their mouth
And now they silent like the B in doubt, no doubt
I didn't wanna be the boy with the rhymes
That spent years in the game but never made no clout
And when I see others success I rate, to me enough of them can't relate
Its cool- you ain't even gotta feel my pain, just feel my rain

[Chorus: Eric B]
I'm one step ahead of you, you never catch up to me
Everybody else is just following me
So just follow my lead, you can follow my lead
I'mma star I'll show you the way [x4]
