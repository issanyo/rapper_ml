[Verse 1: Chip]
Hey, may I speak to you in confidence?
Two shots got me all confident
Big spliff got me all nonchalant
She like Jme in front of an audience
Let the bottles come, let the sparks go out
The bar just said they can't run out
Them niggas ain't got the source for this
I'm like BRB, I've got more lyrics

[Verse 2: Shakka]
I see you staring at the part of the room that I'm standing in
As if I'm doing magic tricks whilst you wonder how they're happening
Ooh, her eyes got me travelling
Ooh, Cupid's got a javelin

[Chorus: Shakka]
Oh no, you don't know what you do
Don't know what you do to me
Oh no, you don't know what you do
Don't know what you do to me
I'm out of control, I'm out of control
Around you
I'm out of control, I'm out of control
Around you, yeah

[Verse 3: Shakka]
Bad at one-liners but I'm damn good at shuffling
Trust, it's better if we dance; if we talk, I'll be rambling
Ooh, why can't I stop gazing?
And woo, Cupid's got a javelin

[Chorus: Shakka]
Oh no, you don't know what you do
Don't know what you do to me
Oh no, you don't know what you do
Don't know what you do to me
I'm out of control, I'm out of control
Around you
I'm out of control, I'm out of control
Around you

[Verse 4: Chip]
(I said BRB, right? Yeah)
See in the dark like Batman
Baby girl got back, man
Tryna pull up to that, fam
No reversing, work it
Look, after here, what's your plan?
Go get your girls, I get the gang
You say bet I can't, bet I can
Get my Fekky on, bu-bu-bang
Just playing, what you saying?
Look, I saw your eyes on me on the way in
Smooth persona she can't decipher
Two shots, now she's swaying
Like oh my god, that dress
But you'd look better undressed
With Chip, never know what's next
But you feel what's pending, yes, come, let's have
Time alone, I ain't that predictable
Don't know what you do to me
Or the things I do for you, yep

[Chorus: Shakka]
Oh no, you don't know what you do
Don't know what you do to me
Oh no, you don't know what you do
Don't know what you do to me
I'm out of control, I'm out of control
Around you
I'm out of control, I'm out of control
Around you
