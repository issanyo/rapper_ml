[Verse 1: Chip]
See, I can't take these man dem
Some promoting beef but getting no Ps man dem
Ain't even got a mix CD
But got the cheek to send for me man dem
You're not Gs, man dem, just cause you talk hard in your bars
Look, you ain't hard in your heart
Look, if you're a bad man, be a badman
If you're a idiot, don't take the badman path (awoh)
And I can't tek the grime man dem
When they indirect and sly man dem
Go for Chip to get noticed
But don't phone me and say hi man dem
It's alright, man dem
See the AR fam? That's my man dem
See us? Cool, suppose it's all love, but hold on a second, yo

[Hook: Chip]
Wah gwan for dem man dem

Always chatting bout leng man dem
End up stuck in the ends man dem, that's dem man dem
See dem man dem?
They're only bad with ten man dem
Always chatting bout leng man dem
End up stuck in the ends man dem, that's dem man dem

[Verse 2: Chip]
They're some sad man dem
Some listen to Giggs and think that they're bad man dem
Look, in the rave waving bandanas
But don't wanna buy no shanks man dem
Some joke man dem, broke man dem
Take two tokes and choke man dem
Ask any real top-of-top shotta
The industry's the new road man dem
Units get sold man dem
And the outfit's gotta stay cold man dem
But the way they promoted hardy on tunes
You would've thought Ed Hardy was new man dem
It's alright man dem
See the AR fam? That's my man dem
See us? Cool, suppose it's all love, but hold on a second, yo

[Hook: Chip]
Wah gwan for dem man dem

Always chatting bout leng man dem
End up stuck in the ends man dem, that's dem man dem

Always chatting bout leng man dem
End up stuck in the ends man dem, that's dem man dem

[Verse 3: Chip]
I do me, man dem (chipmunk)
Switch on your TV, you're bound to see me, man dem
I do shows all over the country
And everyone's throwing up Cs, man dem
Comfortable in my seat, man dem
Face in papers and magazines, man dem
Take note of the N-Dubz tune
Like "you should never mention me" man dem
If you cannot match the CV, man dem
You're an employee, I'm a boss
And I ain't even been writing a lot
I'm flying at the top, call me Lyle and Scott
It's alright, man dem
See the AR fam? That's my man dem
See us? Cool, suppose it's all love, but hold on a second, yo

[Hook: Chip]
Wah gwan for dem man dem

Always chatting bout leng man dem
End up stuck in the ends man dem, that's dem man dem

Always chatting bout leng man dem
End up stuck in the ends man dem, that's dem man dem

Get me?
Dem man dem, yeah
Understand the situation
Cloud 9 Strydes, flee

[Verse 4: Tinchy]
Don't chat about Ps, man dem
Car keys, owned them at 16, man dem (03)
And that was me back then
Money boy since '003, man dem
It's a new year, new goals, man dem
A-list, daytime radio man dem
Live across the road from broke man dem
No less than a G for the show man dem (no less)
F-L-double-E man dem
Raise hell, spray fire like three MAC-10s (buck buck buck)
You ain't gotta rate me, man dem
In fact, forget I MC, man dem (just forget that)
Just know I get paid, man dem
Plus I paved the way for dem man dem
Cool, dem in it for the fame, man dem (Strydes)
Done with the games you play, man dem (buck)
