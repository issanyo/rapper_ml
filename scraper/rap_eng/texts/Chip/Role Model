[Intro]
So you tell me who the kids are looking up to
Chee, Superman Chip, listen

[Hook]
See they say that I'm a role model
But I didn't ask to be
You don't know what it's like
Going college everyday in my hood
When I know men are after me
They wanna see me fall cause I'm on TV
And all the little kids wanna be like me
So I guess I'm a role model
So I guess I'm a role model, listen

[Verse 1]
Balls in the sutin in the morn ain't me
Human nature I grab what I see
In fear of your life you'll grab what's in sight
And swing from the left to the right, alie
Listen, me, I'm just like you
My shit does stink, I'm human too
So why should I make a man violate me
If you don't ever make a man violate you?
See it's more then a Catch 22
Yeah I'm in the limelight, but what can I do?
If they choose to shut me out they will
And So Solid Crew be the damn living proof
See they need to promote, they promoted violence
But did not provoke cry or broken silence
But that's just the life of an artist
The spotlight makes you a target

[Hook]
See they say that I'm a role model
But I didn't ask to be
You don't know what it's like
Going college everyday in my hood
When I know men are after me
They wanna see me fall cause I'm on TV
And all the little kids wanna be like me
So I guess I'm a role model
So I guess I'm a role model, listen

[Verse 2]
I'm living proof you ain't gotta be a nerd to get As
Proof you ain't gotta be a shotta to get paid
Coming up I had some doors closed in my face
But on the road to sucess, I made me a lane
Paved me a way, just me and my team
Kept seeing red but I move like it's green
I couldn't find money but I'd find hope
Chasing the dream with a blind fold
Tryna find money with my eyes closed
Well I might as well have been
Tryna get to heaven but it feels like hell I'm in
And Gucci's got me blowin my dough
Cause I just spend money whenever I feel low
I feel like my mind's in a mosh pit
But thats just the life of an artist
See the spotlight made me a target

[Hook]
See they say that I'm a role model
But I didn't ask to be
You don't know what it's like
Going college everyday in my hood
When I know men are after me
They wanna see me fall cause I'm on TV
And all the little kids wanna be like me
So I guess I'm a role model
So I guess I'm a role model, listen

[Verse 3]
Growing up in a place where there's more hate then love
I was lookin up to men that made money off of drugs
Being surrounded by chicks in a club
Like who the hell said money can't buy love
And school is where the attitude starts
Most of what you learn is irrelevant outta class
Teach the kids to get As and shit
But dont tell a man to get mortgages
Society's designed to contain us in
But I know just what I'd be here for
Cause I give them everything
But they still want more
And 2Pac proved when they die they care more
But I ain't tryna die to sell
But I ain't tryna ask for help
That's just the life of an artist
The spotlight made me a target

[Hook]
See they say that I'm a role model
But I didn't ask to be
You don't know what it's like
Going college everyday in my hood
When I know men are after me
They wanna see me fall cause I'm on TV
And all the little kids wanna be like me
So I guess I'm a role model
So I guess I'm a role model, listen

[Outro]
See what people fail to understand
Is that when your an artist
Even when your in the right, you're in the wrong
You can't win
Lemme get some a's they won't put that in the paper
But let me go mad
And do a total madness
Probly even get the front page
Ageing to see me fall, it won't happen
I got some awards on me now
