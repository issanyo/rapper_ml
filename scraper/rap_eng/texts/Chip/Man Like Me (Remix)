[Verse 1: Kano]
You know I need some more time when a G
Can't fuck with 16s but they're fucking with a
(Man like me) With gyal on my D
The grime scene Adam, where's gyal like Eve?
Might see manaman back around East
Cause I fuck with the youts but man's no priest
(Man like me) Fans dem need
Cause I ain't sold out on my hands and knees
Listen, listen, likkle black sheep
You can't silence them lambs like me
(Man like me) I'm on a mad ting
Mix the vodka with the champers
I was in Syria, you was in Zante
I was on T4, you was in Pampers
(Man like me) Certified
Used to sell herbs, not Herbalife
Been there, bought the T-shirt
I fucked your girlfriend in the merchandise

[Verse 2: Chip]
Cause you see man like me
Grew up on man like Ghetts
Came through when I said I was next
I can back my talk
Left spitters outlined in chalk (dead)
I could name you a list of corpse
But I don't need man coming from the dead for more
A quad bike nearly took my life
I hopped up like Jesus Walks
So what we saying now? These MCs remember me well
Man like me might go off the rails
Futuristic flows, no Behind Barz
That's probably why I ain't been to jail
Or needed bail, turn me up
Man want a hot verse? Phone me up
Tell 'em if they said they're the best MC
Chipmunk, I'm the cunt that'll call your bluff, yeah

[Hook: Rapid & Ghetts]
Man like me (I'm unpredictable)
Man like me (I just got bail)
Man like me (but it's conditional)
Man like, man like, man like, man-man-man-man
Man like me (I'm unpredictable)
Man like me (might go off the rails)
Man like me (just for the principle)
Man like, man like, man like, man-man-man-man

[Verse 3: Devlin]
(Man like me) has got MCs jumping like fleas
When I run up on the set, then squeeze
This might be your wife's backside from her jeans
Spitting lyrics while I give it to her deep
(Man like me) at 2000 degrees
Fire in the Booth for Sloth, have you seen?
Boss, Diana Ross, I'm supreme
What? My manor's hot, I hear the screams
(Man like me) Has got a freedom of speech
Like G when I slaughter these beats
With the force of the beast
Call me a little awkward, at least
I'm still here with the support of the streets
(Man like me) I might switch any second
Inflict pain with a makeshift weapon
Ain't shit changed and my attitude's F 'em
Said that I'll get 'em, then I'll get 'em, let's get 'em

[Verse 4: Ghetts]
(Man like me) They ain't never understand why
I tell a man "mind where you're stepping on my landmine"
I couldn't give a fuck whatever the gang sign
Throw 'em all up, I couldn't care less
(Man like me) I know why the ting's set
I know what the hunger be like when you ain't king yet
I remember when they was all tryna spin Ghetts
And I ain't impressed
(Man like me) They don't know what I'm capable of
They think I'm just Clarke when the cape isn't on
But it's safe to say that I'm dangerous, don
Razor blades in the face of an atheist
Believe me if I say it in a song
Imagine if me and Chip weren't cool, me and Kane weren't friends
Me and Prince didn't meet and me and James didn't bond

[Hook: Rapid & Ghetts]
Man like me (I'm unpredictable)
Man like me (I just got bail)
Man like me (but it's conditional)
Man like, man like, man like, man-man-man-man
Man like me (I'm unpredictable)
Man like me (might go off the rails)
Man like me (just for the principle)
Man like, man like, man like, man-man-man-man

[Verse 5: Rapid]
(Man like me) I'm still here, I'm on top of my game
I raise the bass, I'm hot on the stage
You know I've got you in range, I shoot 'em up point blank
Ready for prey, hit 'em with a brand new wave
(Man like me) I might take it up a notch
Me and my crew, we're way too hot, watch
Ruff Sqwad's gonna get the top slot
Strive, I've got lots, I'm still in the blocks
I'm on the top floor, block 4, money in the top drawer
Top producer, top man, top score
I'm a top gun, I can't be spun
Blaze fire with a 5+3+1
Blaze fire like a summer heatwave or the sun
It's all dumb, the battle's begun
Two hits make an MC jump
MC killer, make an MC slump

[Hook: Rapid & Ghetts]
Man like me (I'm unpredictable)
Man like me (I just got bail)
Man like me (but it's conditional)
Man like, man like, man like, man-man-man-man
Man like me (I'm unpredictable)
Man like me (might go off the rails)
Man like me (just for the principle)
Man like, man like, man like, man-man-man-man
Man like me
Man like me
