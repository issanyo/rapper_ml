[Hook: Dayo Olatunji]
Oopsy daisy, I hurt you again
Crushed your heart in the palm of my hands
If you walk out, baby, I'll understand
'Cause all I'll do is hurt you again

[Verse 1: Chipmunk]
Ch'yeah, and again (yup) and again (yup)
Oops, here we go again (uh oh)
We messed up once, I messed up twice
But many times are we gonna try again? (I dunno)
Girl, it's like 'round and 'round we go
Hustle, I'd prefer if you left me alone (trust)
'Cause I can't take the pain
And my heartbeat feels like an 808

[Bridge: Dayo Olatunji]
I'm a walking disaster
Don't wanna hurt you, that's why you got to go, hun
Destruction like fire, all around you
That's why you got to go, oh oh oh

[Verse 2: Chipmunk]
See the fussin' and fightin', let's not ('llow it)
Before I see red, let's stop (trust)
This here's really the end of
I'ma find cupid and put him in a headlock (no lie)
Now why did you pick on me? (Why?)
Why let the pretty bird shit on me?
I don't need good luck but I need good love
That's a girl that'll stand by me
And look honey I didn't diss you
Therefore I shouldn't have to miss you
And now I feel like The Saturdays all week
'Ca me and my heart got crazy Issues

Girl it's like round and round we go
[Hustle] I'll prefer if you left me alone
Cause I can't take the pain
And my heartbeat feels like an 808

[Verse 3: Chipmunk]
Yeah, they say three times a lady
I say three times you're crazy
So done with the messin' around
Baseball love, three strikes you're out
You're too busy tryna' catch me out
But I just wanna get home, run
'Ca touring, after a while gets boring
I need to come back to your touch
Look it's all too much, I guess now we gotta let go
You see me grow from a boy to a man
So this must really be the end of the road

And girl its like round and round we go
[Hustle] I'd prefer if you left me alone
Cause I can't take the pain
And my heartbeat feels like an 808
