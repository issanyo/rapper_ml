[Verse 1: Chip]
I am the grime scene saviour, Rudolph raver
Chick-King eater, T high-streeter
Gladesmore jumper, Adidas sneaker
Prada wearer, lyrical MC tearer
Straight out the 90s era
Came out the chlorine, now I see clearer
You vs. me, on you that's not fairer
Peep at the top, I'm nearer
I am the circular mover, 24 shooter
16 year old MC trooper
Alwayz recorder, walk with the Lord, not a borer
Mr. Munk's raw to the corer
You got your wifey, you're at home lipsing her up
She see's me, she's flexing sorer
It's not a kiss ting, straight up pull down the zip ting
Flick out the ting then bore her
Big bar writer cuh I'm not hyper
Grew up on Dragon Ball Z and Street Fighter
BMX rider, gyal dem creeper
Full time mic man, part time grinder
If you don't like me, I don't like you neither
Doughnut, you're a minor, you come like cider
I'm the Wray & Nephews rider
Nah you could never test this rhymer

[Hook: Chip]
(Who are you?)
Look cuzzy I'm Chipmunk
Known in the grime scene, I'm taking over
(Who are you?)
A nocturnal creature
Snooze, you lose, the game is over
(Who are you?)
Look, by now you know the name
So there's no need to say
16, 3 mixtapes, yeah, I'm in the game
Ain't nobody hot for my name

[Verse 2: Chip]
Yo, yo, I'm 2 steps ahead
24-7 I up the levs
No soundboi could've dissed my team
From time I'm with Baff and I've always said
I'm still down for C dot Ms
See, won't stop till I see them M's
Alwayz Recording, big from morning
Dun'know fo-sh Chippy keeps it bless
And I'm fully grown, quote what Frisco said
There no dilly, no dally in music
Diss me, you stupid?
Cuzzy I'm a lord of the mic
I'll write a 16 then shoot it
These kids can't do how I do this
Yeah Mr. Munk's moving
Top 3 youts in the game, it's me they're choosing
Cuzzy my mixtape proves it!

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Chip]
Nah, nah, ain't nobody hot for my name
I'm more than hot for my age
Can't stop for a break, like let alone stop for a day
Bars that I made do more than light up a rave
In a clash I will light up your face
You're a spade I'm an ace, I'm a dan, you're a waste
I'm Puffy, you're Mase, I'm fully in charge
League of my own, I'm a bully with bars
And not many kids wanna see me and start
Cah like Double S I get busy with bars
I'm Chippy I'm skippy I'm fully advanced
I am in a league of my own
Circular mover but I still move on my own
Gotta stay out for the dough
I set the level up, kids have to pedal up
Cuh Mr. Munk's going on sho
