[Hook: Lethal Bizzle]
Yeah, I'm a London boy like the Kray, Kray Kray (Ronnie, Reggie, Ronnie, Reggie)
Old school like the More Fire sample, hey, hey, hey (Chubby, drizzle, skeng, skeng)
Some real top boys, yeah G, they're from my way
(North, South, East, West)
If you're a fuckboy, please don't come my way
(Never, never, never, never)
I'm a London boy like the Kray, Kray Kray (Ronnie, Reggie, Ronnie, Reggie)
Old school like the More Fire sample, hey, hey, hey (Chubby, drizzle, skeng, skeng)

(North, South, East, West)
If you're a fuckboy, please don't come my way
(Never, never, never, never)

[Verse 1: Lethal Bizzle]
Yo, I used to kick ball, I used to shot
I used to keep few grams in my socks
I used to be on ringer, Jeleras, down through alleyways losing the cops
I moved the key, I moved the box
Some of the mandem run into shops
One time I was running late so I jumped in the ringer, went Top of the Pops
Na I weren't that bad, just one of the boys
Some done robberies, some done 'roids
I've done me, I wanted P's
Where the mandem stay 100 degrees
Want 110's, off key tees
Hit Pro B, old dry white knees
Hit JD's, HMV's
Then I flipped it, now I sell CD's

[Hook: Lethal Bizzle]
'Cause I'm a London boy like the Kray, Kray Kray (Ronnie, Reggie, Ronnie, Reggie)
Old school like the More Fire sample, hey, hey, hey (Chubby, drizzle, skeng, skeng)

(North, South, East, West)
If you're a fuckboy, please don't come my way
(Never, never, never, never)
I'm a London boy like the Kray, Kray Kray (Ronnie, Reggie, Ronnie, Reggie)
Old school like the More Fire sample, hey, hey, hey (Chubby, drizzle, skeng, skeng)

(North, South, East, West)
If you're a fuckboy, please don't come my way
(Never, never, never, never)

[Verse 2: Chip]
Oi, Chippy, man a London boy, Dungeon boy
Man ain't from round here, run them boys
020 708, how many spitters? All seven get ate
Pirate radio, London sets
Built this ting, that was London, yes
Embrace man from outside of town
But disrespect, show you how London gets
Take a London check, man get boyed
Man's self-made and self-employed
Fully grown man, no I'm not no boy
Boyed, can't address me with 'Oi'
Tourist attraction
See me in the States like "You've got an accent"
Cah man's English and man speak it
Can't school me on my country, leave it

[Hook: Lethal Bizzle]
'Cause I'm a London boy like the Kray, Kray Kray (Ronnie, Reggie, Ronnie, Reggie)
Old school like the More Fire sample, hey, hey, hey (Chubby, drizzle, skeng, skeng)

[Verse 3: Lethal Bizzle]
Yo, man are old school, old school, old school
Yeah, that's word to Raskit
And put me anywhere on that field
You know I'm scoring a hat-trick
Yeah G, I'm far from poor
Draw six birds, I'm 'bout to beat four
Seen a few mill, I'm about to see more
Violate me, you're bound to see war
Yeah, Stone Island with the Air Max, you know how we function
And I know real bad boys out here on clapping, hold tight Junction
Local Beyonces want a rudeboy, she might call that punching
But man already know that money makes you handsome

[Hook: Lethal Bizzle]
'Cause man a London boy like the Kray, Kray Kray (Ronnie, Reggie, Ronnie, Reggie)
Old school like the More Fire sample, hey, hey, hey (Chubby, drizzle, skeng, skeng)
