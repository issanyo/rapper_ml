[Chorus]
Right now everyting bookey
Right now everyting bookey
Blud, I thought my man loved man's side man
He didn't prove it
See money come, see money go
Watch money come, money moving
Right now I'm out of order
Trust me, man can't use me
Right now everyting bookey
Right now everyting bookey (can't trust no one)
Man, I thought my girl loved man's side girl
She didn't prove it (gone with the next man)
See money come, see money go
Watch money come, money moving
But right now, everyting's bookey

[Verse 1]
If man call me bro that means family ties (better treat me like fam)
That means it's heart to heart when we don't see eye to eye (you understand?)
But man switch it up over years, man switch it up overnight (oi, what happened to my man?)
Be a sideman moving sideways, now I've gotta switch my lines (gone!)
Clear mind frame, straight high grade, no more green or purple ('llow that)
Looking around like "who can I trust?" will make man halve their circle (yeah)
But the lord got me (amen), and I got myself
And if nobody don't like me, fuck it, I write for myself (trust me)

[Hook]
Right now everyting bookey, right now everyting bookey
Blud, I thought my man loved man's side man, he didn't prove it
See money come, see money go, watch money come, money moving
Right now I'm out of order, trust me, man can't use me
Right now everyting bookey, right now everyting bookey (can't trust no one)
Man, I thought my girl loved man's side girl, she didn't prove it (gone with the next man)
See money come, see money go, watch money come, money moving
But right now, everyting's bookey

[Verse 2]
Chipmunk dumps on rap, Chipmunk dumps on grime (facts!)
Ayy blud, go ask my ex, don't pep when it's dumping time (never!)
Stressed out, need a masseuse like why they tryna play with my mind?
See the mind games, nobody wins, oi, do your ting, I'll do mine (gone again!)
Clear mind frame, just high grade and cut down on liquor
Them movements run soul but man can't be my nigga
It's like being good don't work either, you've seen how Jesus died
I told Dad when he goes church, pray for me in these bookey times, yeah (trust me)

[Chorus]
Right now everyting bookey
Right now everyting bookey
Blud, I thought my man loved man's side man
He didn't prove it
See money come, see money go
Watch money come, money moving
Right now I'm out of order
Trust me, man can't use me
Right now everyting bookey
Right now everyting bookey (can't trust no one)
Man, I thought my girl loved man's side girl
Dhe didn't prove it (gone with the next man)
See money come, see money go
Watch money come, money moving
But right now, everyting's bookey
