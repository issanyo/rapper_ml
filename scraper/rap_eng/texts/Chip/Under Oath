[Hook: Chip]
Under oath, I don’t lie in the booth
Sing it to me, it’s the gospel truth


[Verse 1: Chip]
So we know how the story or glory goes
But I just tell lies like the Morgan Show
I don’t rap about trappin but you know the shit’s real
I’m the north side product, that the best bricks built
Grew up around the worst of us, made it to the best of us
Fucking every couple, but I’m shitting on the rest of em
The weed stops my growth but my money’s getting tal
Success is just a journey where your circle gets smaller
Liars don’t holler me, cut me I bleed honestly
Game’s just a book I read, you’re looking like a novel
Born in lights switched to increase the stats
I won’t fade away if they give me a shot
King dreams when I aim for the net
You internet geeks are just quoting my web
I be fresh on the scene, a hundred million dreams
Never lie in the booth, truth, are you mean

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Trae Tha Truth]
Same shit, different day, niggas know how it goes
Tryina tell em that I’m a star, pay attention, it shows
So we knocking at the door like why the fuck is they close
Is to the niggas helping, they laughing fuck em, they hoes
They don’t owe a nigga nothing, all good I suppose
They left a nigga in the gutter, they was ballin like pros
I don’t make you reppin I’m a cop but only head and there’s nose
Get rid of it, hit the light and leave him in the whip that I chose
I dare it to go rose and leave the rest of it froze
Laid up with entertainment bitches, some of them missin they clothes
It’s a real nigga in the building, lord knows
Haters aimin for the target while these women they hoes
Tell them that I’m the truth, nothing less if I talk
Nothing less than runnin these streets, off in this money I walk
Never made it to commercial but I’m famous in the hood
In the city, I’m the throneless king, understood?
