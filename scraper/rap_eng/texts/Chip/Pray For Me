[Intro]
Yeah, from hills high in heaven
To Psalms 27
It's that gospel
Take my word for it
Ah, check, listen

[Verse 1]
You see the music business is like the devil's games
So If you play then you might adopt the devil's ways
It's an eye for an eye, a tooth the same
I'm tired of everybody taking shots up my name
I'm just shooting for my targets
Look if you've been shooting yourself in the foot, don't hold me hostage
Making what doesn't sell
Then you complaining when it doesn't sell
Now with that off my chest I'mma hope for the best
I'm never going back to the press, though they wanna see me stress
Counting money and staying relevant
Made me know the difference between family and relatives
I beg the Lord show me a path
Snakes are in my bloodline, and in my grass
Not talking to my marge, cut my family in half
If you reap what you sow, let me break my own heart
Come on

[Chorus]
(Pray for me)
Yeah, please take me to a level only Heaven is above
(Pray for me)
Yeah, I've sinned in the past still Heaven is a must
(Pray for me, yeah)
With the world on my shoulders, I bench-press the game
(Pray for me, yeah)
You know the Lord is my Shepherd so I can't be afraid

[Verse 2]
Pray for me I need it, the good in me is leaking
I only bought this pendant so they can see Jesus
To show what I believe in, shit's getting stranger
The little change I've made got them questioning my faith
My visions strange when they negatively name me
I see low, does that make me crazy?
Suicidal tweets, can you blame me?
Yeah, look what success did to aim me
They couldn't work out my letters so they hung me
I've been fire alie, how could you bun me?
As I stay afloat, it's titanic for 'em
My confidence is made of titanium

I told everybody I'm the savior
Special like I'm born in a manger, major
Born to succeed, who's as humble as me
As long as I got an arm, I wear a heart on my sleeve
Come on

[Chorus]
(Pray for me)
Yeah, please take me to a level only Heaven is above
(Pray for me)
Yeah, I've sinned in the past still Heaven is a must
(Pray for me, yeah)
With the world on my shoulders, I bench-press the game
(Pray for me, yeah)
You know the Lord is my Shepherd so I can't be afraid

[Bridge: Chipmunk]
Looking back like, look what the deal did?
Still with the same circle and I'm still Chip
That's why who I share the last pound with is the same people that I share a mill with

Six zero's in my last mill with
Bread and wine, last supper was some real shit
The prayer's been sent, now we're ready
All Judas's has been removed already
Let's roll

[Hook]
(Pray for me)
Yeah, please take me to a level only Heaven is above
(Pray for me)
Yeah, I've sinned in the past still Heaven is a must
(Pray for me, yeah)
With the world on my shoulders, I bench-press the game
(Pray for me, yeah)
You know the Lord is my Shepherd so I can't be afraid

Pray for me
Pray for me
Pray for me, yeah
Pray for me, yeah

[Verse 3]
Tell my chick don't leave me now, tell my feet don't fail me now
It's too late I'm in front of this crowd
When you see me bow
I'll drown in my own sweat before they take me out
Take the jewels, take the fame
Take the buzz, take the name but the talent still remains
And tell the hater change of plan
I tell the label, drop me you still wonâ€™t reach me where I land
Piss off, this ain't a big trap
This is C-4 gift wrapped, I reply to every diss track
Back from the future, you plums
Thanks in advance for the apologies to come
I'm sick trust me
Eat a plate of fame of vomit, still reppin' for the hungry
Heads shots with success bullets
More Mobo's, Brits and Grammy's before I pull it

[Outro]
Believe me, the flow's tight but the jeans ain't
You can't compromise these days
I opened doors and took the blame for it
'Bout time I do me and get paid for it
So fuck a marketing plan
I'm light skinned and I can smile, come on, market me, man
Pray for me and play your position
I evidently made a transition
