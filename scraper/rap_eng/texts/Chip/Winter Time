[Hook]
Yeah, in the winter time, it gets cold
Tracksuits, boots and coats
I do mic and my friends do road
In the summertime, they've got snow
Year 9, started doing my thing
Year 10, hit school in my Timbs
Year 11, in a league of my own
Yeah

[Verse 1]
Bringing that heat again
Like we're back on Heat FM (mic check, 1-2)
Trust me, the winter's cold
Chipmunk's got the heat for them (fire)
Taking shots, I'm Luke Cage
If I dish them out, I'm on Arsenal (cannon)
If I lick that shot, I will harm you
Football head like Hey, Arnold
King of my, king of my
King of my castle (royal)
Delivery on Royal Mail
I'll write a bomb and pass the parcel (hold that, fam)
Mad ting sad ting
The game's cold, I adapted
Gelled in any habitat that I tapped in
Checked out when I cashed in
Yeah, Finsbury Park, check T, get shaped nice
On the 406 on a late night
West End, chopsticks on a date night (swag)
Fly boy getting ras cuh I spray nice
Mad hours I be putting in work like a trap boy
Vampire ting, I hate daytime (yeah)
Man engage when I gauge mine
Pull up on the set and just spray like

[Hook]
In the winter time, it gets cold (freezing)
Tracksuits, boots and coats (swag)
I do mic and my friends do road (more time)
In the summertime, they've got snow (juuging)
Year 9, started doing my thing (ayy)
Year 10, hit school in my Timbs (swag)
Year 11, in a league of my own (early)
Years, I've been doing my ting (yep)
Years, I've been doing my ting
Years, I've been doing my ting, I've been doing my ting
Years, I've been doing my ting (yep)
Years, I've been doing my ting, I've been doing my ting
Years, I've been doing my ting
Years, I've been doing my ting, I've been doing my ting
Years, I've been doing my ting
Years, I've been doing my ting
Years, I've been doing my thing

[Verse 2]
I feel what's coming in due course (timing)
Do my ting, go do yours ('llow it)
Tek man's gyal, that's true, darg (facts)
Do my ting or do yours (sliding)
You can't take me for a fool, darg (never)
Got more bars than a crew, darg (numbers)
Have your whole crew like "oh lord" (god)
Man know when I strap, that's danger (mad)
Prass, like I'm born in a manger
Why you looking at your boy? He can't save ya (no)
Man can't get saved from the saviour (never)
Independent, mind of a major (yeah)
Do it on my own, done it, would amaze ya (standard)
Who's that saying grime scene saviour?
You ain't me, fam, do me a favour ('llow it)
Bar for bar, can't test man, later
Get it then, get it now or later
Blud, I don't give a fuck how you feeling (nah)
Cash Motto, only here for the paper (gang)
Get waved, then I touch mic, what's the outcome?
Could be a mixtape, could be an album
Could be an EP, could be a three-piece
Still got lyrics for anybody doubting, listen
