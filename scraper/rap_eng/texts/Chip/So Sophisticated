I'm so sophisticated
Deals on the table
Like what's the payment
Negotiating new negotiations
I'm busy rapping
My niggas trapping
We make it happen
Same shit different toilet
All bars in a package
How you want it you can get it
Yea, that's direct with no debit
Ok, I met this chick in Rose club
I was with Joe, that's my breadrin
Her skin colour was butter
I took her home spread it(UGH)
These rappers are sniffing lines
But they ain't spittin' no crack
Needle in my veins, only when i get tatts
My niggas got that be around
Like they bout their honey
So if your a broke joke
You won't find me funny
Kicking ball with my niggas
Just minding my own buiss
Three niggas tried rush me
That's two flaps on the clit,Pussies
I ain't with all the G talk
I'm laid back but I C4
They came in on some G flex
Back fired, rebores
I'm screaming north side birthed me
I'm never switching sides, I ain't Van Persie
Lions, gorillas, snakes, animals but they know me
North London's one big jungle
Well fuck it, im Mowgli
I'm sick and tired of these grown men with women traits
Bitches is bitches
Niggas is bitches
It's all the same
You probaly love your chick
But she just loves to rave
That's why I never love a chick
And only love to chase
I don't care for these pricks
Too busy gettin rich
Ram roll me a spliff
Two pulls them im miff, shit
My stress could never be no chick
But to all you girls that are tripping
I hope you land on my dick(UGH)
My ability is all that I believe in
Screaming free Smit until they freed him
Just got a box of the trees in
Blunt full of pro
Green call it Steven
One party, two parties
What's the after one
I never hit a house rave till like after one
Egg maybe, hot lighty
Yea im after one
Bitches on the pill and not the morning after one
I think out of the box when I spit
You pop a lacative
You still wouldn't come up with this shit
I go so in with the words
Write a racket then serve
Swinging like Murray for Britain
I get love for a verse(UGH)
Yea, like fuck you and your wealth fam
My mixtape be on the way and so is you girl fam
Them rappers cool
But im the hottest write now
And London Boys a broken lift
I promise it won't let you down, I swear

And that's grand hustle, hustle gang
CMAR that's cash motto always recording
Mother-beeep
(Chuckles) YAH
