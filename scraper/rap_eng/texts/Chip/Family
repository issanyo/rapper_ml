[Hook: Loick Essien]
Don't know why they call me fam
'Cause they don't treat me like we're family
People use the word so casually
They say I'm petty, yeah I can be
Lord knows I've got my family
I just want to see them happy
So if I bring you around my...
Just hope you treat me right like we're
Lord knows I love my family

[Verse 1: Chip]
I pray at night like farda help me
Focussed on my dream, Its got me feelin' selfish
My brothers gone, they said he's banked his rights
When they said kidnap, I said Lord have mercy
Like how the fuck? We're from a good home
And daddy couldn't be there anymore, If he could bro
Education that's the key, we were told
And you and him ain't blood but he still to raised you like his own
So fuck a half brother, you my full one
And one time for dad, cause that's a real one
At 17 or 20, should be young and taping jezzies
Got me sittin' here just thinking, mum just had us too young
And water thick as blood, yeah it can be
But listen to me close you got a family
Luigi, I'm your brudda til' the end
You see Mario, that's more than just a friend

[Verse 2: Chip]
No time for a wifey, I don't need stress
Crown for Jahnay, that's my princess
Worry about having a sister when I came in the game
Jahmal and Jahnay, we both got Jah in our names
I love you likkle sister, more than just a sibling
I haven't seen mum and dad as happy since your christening
It's love and guidance for you on the track
Situations change, so don't get too attached
No offence to your boyfriend, 'cah I like him
Trust issues in me, when I'm writing
Fucking with my sister, just know I love her
So that means that you're her lover, then treat her good forever and I will treat you like my brother (uh)
Cah blood is thick as water, yeah it can be
Cash motto photographer, keep it in the family
Mum had locs like Lauryn Hill, you got lots like mummy year
Mario, Luigi and there's Princess

[Verse 3: Chip]
Got another brother, if you didn't know
Aiden Fyffe, he's only one years old
Boy, you got me strappin' three verses
Like my dastehan is still workin'
Addition to the family, yo
Can't wait to see you grow
Chillin' in your cousins arms, like yeah you got the families nose
And you got C in life, I got you brother
All I don't even really know your mother
Mummy got two baby dads
Daddy got two baby mums
Seen marriage, seen divorce
Trust me I ain't on it blud
But course I'm still a family man
One day when you hear this, I hope you understand
As thick as water
Yeah it can be
Bloods makes you relatives
Loyalty makes...
I don't use the word casually
We ain't grow together, but you family
