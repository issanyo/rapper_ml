[Intro]
A little interval
To remind you people
I still do what I do
[Laughs]
Holla at me M
Let me go

[Verse]
You talk money I overstand ya
Money is the motive everyday I want my grands up
I weren't the kid in class front row with my hands up
But somehow I still pass
Hit yard and still bar
No half-heart
Commercial and credible, I'm half and half
Cause I can water down a single for the charts
And top any chart-topper in a bar, don't start with me dawg
You want it? I'm the one prick, I'm so fly, I'm not the one to fuck with
Touch Chip, I ain't buying what you're selling
Time is of the essence, you boys can't smell it
(Chip) So chill with your blocked noses
If you see me, act cool, stop the hard poses
I don't fare posin', I am not jokin'
I am tryin' to get the bread I don't do loafin'

I put it down for the wishing
No lie I'm tryin' stay alive to make a killin'
Send it I kill it
My features alive
A sixteen verse turn your song into mine (it's no lie)
(Yeah) Throw me an A even
Odd thoughts in my brain
No I ain't even
No I ain't leavin'
Better see me dim
Popped in '06 and I'm still peakin'
Still here
Pissed off half the game
Doin' it for years and you ain't got half my name
I'm so not the same, cause I made the change
Cause I spit the good shit and made the change
Niggas' say I sold out please
I never made an album for the cheese
I made an album that represents me (I Am)
Besides I do as I please

Jeez Louise, Julius Caesar the beat
Link with Chip, first link seize the beat
I don't know what you heard about me
But don't leave your girl around me
You can see I got swag (no lie)
When it comes to word play I'm a dad (father)
Laid back cruise 'round in a cab
But I wear whip money on my hands
And the girls go weak for the tatts (they go weak)
Ink made me I get it in
So I put me ink in the skin (some new tats)
And the ice doesn't freeze my drinks
So I put me some in the rink

Bling bling, Blackberry ring ring (we counting money over here)
I'm in (yup yup)
Seems what I'm tellin' them
The other thing that I'm in is telligent
And look me no liar
Pyrotechnic, I play with fire
And I have everything they require
And everything I wear is designer (head to toe)
Fire alie, yeah I'm hot
If they got swag what have I got (somethin' else)
I'm ahead of flash kids
Don't look over here if you epileptic (shut your eyes boy)
My foot's down on the pedal
The best weed couldn't get your boys on my level (too high)
So how you gonna finish me?
Better cop you a ladder to infinity (plus more)
And tip toe on top of it
No scomo you ain't toppin' it
You crept to me boy, put a sock in it
Andrex nigga I'm on top of shit
