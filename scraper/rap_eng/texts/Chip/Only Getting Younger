[Hook: Paigey Cakey]
It's like we're only getting older but they see us getting younger
We're only getting older but they see us getting younger
See us getting younger
They see us getting younger
See us getting younger
They see us getting younger
See us getting younger
They see us getting younger
See us getting younger
They see us getting younger

[Verse 1: Paigey Cakey]
Sometimes I rock my Js
Sometimes I rock my heels
Sometimes I wanna party
Sometimes I wanna chill
Plus I'm always independent, I'll be grinding hard for real
But tonight I'm tryin'a turn up, sorry, that's just how I feel
What you know about P?
Northside to the East
Sing and I rap and I act, murder drama on the beat, ho
Fabulous, I tell'm breath, ho
Started young but now she's grown
F your table, I'm taking shots for like me and all of my people
Uhh, I'm just tryn'a breathe, that's why I love my trees
I dunno where I am, but I don't wanna leave
I'm with Chip, like, you should know the team
I've got five favourite letters - CMAR and P

[Hook: Paigey Cakey]

[Verse 2: Chip]
Yo, I'm stoned
But I'm feeling amazing
Life is a book, right now we on Paigey Cake
Keep the bottles coming over, all cushty
Please don't touch the drinks unless you're letting off your pussy
My sets good, I'm set good
My chick bad, my weed good
I spit Ye, it's all good
From north side, to your hood
These chicks don't want it with Paigey
She the hottest of the female rappers
These chicks better stay in their lane
Or I'll be coming at a female rapper
And you can check my credentials, spitters don't want it with me
I've got five favourite letters - CMAR and P

[Hook: Paigey Cakey x2]
