[Intro: Sample from The Matrix]
Morpheus: It is the world that has been pulled over your eyes to blind you from the truth
Neo: What truth?
Morpheus: That you are a slave. Like everyone else, you were born into bondage. Born into a prison that you cannot smell or taste or touch. A prison for your mind

[Intro: Chip]
Just another Wednesday night/morning
4am flows, mmm hmm
(Splurgeboys)

[Verse: Chip]
I wake up on a daily basis
See these niggas changing faces
Fuck the game, I'll rearrange it
I'm the one that'll replace it
I'm the one they ain't safe with
I'm the one, they can't take it
If you rate me, say it online
Not on the sly, I want praising
Nah, fuck that, keep your ratings
My bipolar thoughts sound amazing
Oi, you ain't my friend, you're faking
Disrespect the thing, catch a blazing
I nearly didn't believe in me
Cuh look how the industry treated me
It chewed me up, then it spat me out
Now I'm spitting back, they're all preeing me
Safe, you brought out the me in me
If you do not get what I mean
Then you wasn't here at the time
But get in my way and you'll see
I've got the powers and forces
If I peppered your clart, you forced me
I know everything comes back around
So I'll wait my time, I won't force it
Cuh these man know about hype
They don't know about sound
Tune for tune in a dance
I'll lick a man down
Chatting 'bout pop back then
Who's popping right now?
Blud, I opened doors
For everyone popping right now
Say what I like
I ain't taking no talk back
Loafers with no socks and jack-ups
Man don't care 'bout all that
Nah, that's not me
Never get rubbed by another MC
I don't wanna kill off another MC (*kiss*)
Test Chipmunk
You'll get Kill Off Killy
I hold my own in grief
Grew up on President T
Make girl way up north
Wanna pop their T
Cuh 'nough of them man too angry
Ain't got the vibe like me
Ain't got the talk like me
Ain't got the source like me
Ain't got the torch like me
Cuh I give gyal the fork like...

[Break: Chip]
Yo, what the fuck, man? Oi, blud
Oi, what we saying?
Oi, fuck this

[Bridge: Chip]
I made it sonic boom on these niggas
I don't wan' share no zoots with these niggas
I keep my energies to myself
Don't wanna be in a room with these niggas
I made it sonic boom on these niggas
Back now, there ain't room for these niggas
I've got a lot of pain, a lot of pain
I'mma charge back to the game, back to the game, yeah

[Outro: Chip]
Know how many years I spent thinking the Matrix was real?
I had to come back for the agents
It weren't real
Morpheus was a fucking lie
The kills were lies, it was all a fucking lie, bro
