[Hook 1]
If you, you, wanna come against I, I
That Lambo weren't yours, no, you're not KSI-I
Turn into the devil, that's fine, fine
God flow just in time, time
You wanted a MOBO so bad
Send your address, I'll send one of mine, mine
Don't worry about me, I'm fine, fine
Too much gym or rhymes, rhymes

[Verse 1]
Pree my @s, I said blast you for that, I said, ok that's fine, fine
Sometimes I'm a sweet boy, right now manaman are on grime, grime
You came out in a Green Lam, went home, face sour like lime, lime
This year not your time
Pepper man normal
Your negative energy ain't normal
Chillin' with the mandem, smoking weed on the sofa
Winning MOBOs, normal
The way you got in the game is not normal
The way you hop on names is not normal
You still wanna turn into Lucifer
You need holy water, you ain't normal
Don't rate me in silence, tweet me, I want feedback
I told them I'll smash mine, weighed it up, they don't need that
Next time pick your battles more wisely, I'm not the one you idiot
Say you wanna clash me, tell Delissa
Holla my manager, idiot
If the money ain't right, don't waste my time
Like fuck it, I'll dig you out of your grave just so I can bury you one more time
Duppy Riddim, you didn't reply
Cause you know the powers that got to your mind
I'm cut from a cloth that you're not designed
Chipmunk relegator, can't compete
You signed up to a mission that you can't complete
This ain't GTA or San Andreas, this is real life, you chief
You didn't prosper at the awards cuh look how you come in the game, cheat
CTRL+ALT+DELETE, cheat

[Hook 2]
If you, you, wanna come against I, I
That Lambo weren't yours, no, you're not KSI-I
Turn into the devil, that's fine, fine
God flow just in time, time
You wanted a MOBO so bad
Send your address, I'll send one of mine, mine
Don't worry about me, I'm fine, fine
Too much gym or rhymes, rhymes
I'll teach you about light work
Boxing don't help your rhymes, rhymes

Trust me, your energy's all wrong, oh so wrong. Big up all my brothers in the 0161, love, maximum love

[Verse 2]
You said numbers don't lie and that's true, you wasteman
"Dickhead" outsold "Wasteman", now who's the wasteman, wasteman?
This flow is so fun, put it on a wasteman (Bluku bye bye bye bye)
How dare you come for the saviour, should have stayed in your place, damn
You've been sniffing charlie, literally sniffing Charlie
Pepper you one more time and then I'll go see Charlie
Just because of my pen you've had to recruit an army
But my pen's my army, them devil boy, they can't harm me

You get me, cuh I was left to sort this alone. So I took your mojo, took the "M" off, now you're alone. #BugginAlone bruh. Ay trust me, Believe & Achieve. That's the Ethos in life, episode 2, November 27th. And I'm throwing a party that night, flyers out soon, peng tings you dun know, guest list ting, holla. Come turn up with the mandem. CM, Cash Motto, Paw Gang, yeah
