[Chorus: B Young & 23]
Ring ring pon the hands free
Piff ting called Ashanti
I zing zing like the Grand Prix
She fling fling off the panties
And them tings extra fancy
She know just what she came to do
She wanna live life jumanji (Testin')
Girl you know I got just the place for you (Two-three)

[Verse 1: 23]
(Two-three)
Jumanji
If your body need fixing I'm the man B
Zing zing like the Grand Prix
Soon as I pull up she popping off the panties
And since she heard a brother just stepped in sauce
She reckless behind bedroom doors
Sent 2 text and paused
Don't ask silly questions I sexed of course
But let me dig a little deeper
You know that this is real cos I picked you over some FIFA
Sober me won't do it but the henny might
Bad girl she pretty pon any side
Foolish like Ashanti
See you're the plan A, there ain't not plan B
Shawty sweet like candy
She wanna live life jumanji  (Two-three)

[Chorus: B Young]
Ring ring pon the hands free
Piff ting called Ashanti
I zing zing like the Grand Prix
She fling fling off the panties
And them tings extra fancy
She know just what she came to do
She wanna live life jumanji
Girl you know I got just the place for you

[Verse 2: Chip]
I say them things that you like
I handle bars, yes I grip you tight
Like said she wanna ride bike, I told her link up
Playing with my balls, baby these ain't trick nuts
Had a plan A and made him plan B
She ain't bad and boujee, she ratchet and she fancy
Big batty girl I see you flexing
But you get way too much attention
Ring, ring, I see her pon my celly
Piff ting called Rochelle, me call Shelly
Gyal got some mhm mhm it's sweet to the belly
I bring the vibes you want vodka or henny?
I hop in bed without my Calvins
She know just what she came to do
She wanna live life jumanji
Gyal you make me wanna stay with you

[Chorus: B Young]
Ring ring pon the hands free
Piff ting called Ashanti
I zing zing like the Grand Prix
She fling fling off the panties
And them tings extra fancy
She know just what she came to do
She wanna live life jumanji
Girl you know I got just the place for you

[Verse 3: B Young]
So let me bring down the lighting
Slip off your tights and we can be vybzin
Girl I see you lip biting
You got the cake and I got the icing
Now I got you igniting
Grindinâ€™ and hitting them spots that you liking
I swear that big batty frightening
Might have you swapping your main with your side ting

[Chorus: B Young]
Ring ring pon the hands free
Piff ting called Ashanti

She fling fling off the panties
And them tings extra fancy
She know just what she came to do
She wanna live life jumanji
Girl you know I got just the place for you
