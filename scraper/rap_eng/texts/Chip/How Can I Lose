How can I lose
My way now
My winnings
How can I lose my way now

Go this way, first exit
Roundabout, cut the traffic out
When the lights turn red, don't stop
Look at the camera, middle fingers up
Me losing my lady, it's crazy
So driver speed up
Cause if the plane boards, I'ma gonna go nuts

It's over and I started it
It's over, it's over
And when I see your pictures
Gets me fucking mad
It's over, it's over
How can I lose
My way now, my winnings
How can I lose
My way now, she's winning

I'm like take this right, first left
I'm bringing money I'll be with you in a sec
I got the Beats by Dre's in my ears
Slow jams wishing you were here
And when you're not, it's like I'm dreaming
Twist and turning when I'm sleeping
I'm weeping
So don't go, please stay
If you're checked in check out, I'm on my way
When the light turns red, don't stop
Middle finger, smile on my face
Me losing my lady, it's crazy
So driver speed up
Cause if the plane boards, I'm gonna go nuts

It's over and I started it
It's over, it's over
And when I see your pictures
Gets me fucking mad
It's over, it's over
How can I lose
My way now, my winnings
How can I lose
My way now, she's winning

They say cheats don't prosper and players never win
But I'm still going in
I see you on your way out, shoulda never let you in
It is what is or, is what it isn't
Blind to your love, now I couldn't see the vision
Wishing we were under the mistletoe kissing
Like every day is Christmas
Got me catting for the beat no whiskers
Yea, you can't play me right
On a next level I'ma catch a flight
You ain't sure don't leave too fast
With me you get a stamp first class
And me plus you winning
Murder she wrote, call it a killing
So I don't know how cool I'll be
She left that when I need TLC

It's over and I started it
It's over, it's over
And when I see your pictures
Gets me fucking mad
It's over, it's over
How can I lose
My way now, my winnings
How can I lose
My way now, she's winning
How can I lose
My way now, my winnings
How can I lose
My way now, she's winning
