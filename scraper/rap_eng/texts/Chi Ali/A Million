A lot of speculation on the crime that I did
Dimes that I've slid
How a nigga been in the limes since a kid
When I was on the run all the time where I hid
What type of shit run through your mind on the bid?
Are you sorry for what you did? And jail was it lonely?
That’s a nice watch, what is that, a Rollie?
Are you still a parolie? I seen you with Joey
Crack in the video, is Fat Joe your homie?
Homie, slow down, I just came home
Can I get a minute, with my kids on my own?
Can I zone for a minute?
Dog, I just finished, doing 12 years surrounded by sergeants and lieutenants
Now I’m surrounded by frauds that’s in this bizness
That rap hard, but they soft and so timid
Lord, give me the strength to deal with this fake shit
Cause I’m just too real
So when a rapper says just call me, I do and he ignore me
After he show love as soon as he saw me
It annoys me, Mike said it’s common practice
He said the rap game is filled with a lot of actors
I’m used to deal with the fish you cats
They miss you calling, they hit you back
They say they gonna give you something
And they give you that
And if they not gonna do something, they tell you that
It’s so simple, but enough about that
Flex, tell Slay, ain't enough that I’m back
And the flow is intact, and I’m lookin like I’m 21
The bid’s over, so let’s let the money come
I could ask the questions, but I’m all about the dough
So the question I ask is, how bad you wanna know?

Blam, blam, blam, blam
A million, a million, a million
A million, a million, a million
