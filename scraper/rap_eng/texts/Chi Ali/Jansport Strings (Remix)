One time up for Chi-Ali
Cuz I could be in a box if I ain't see that screen
My mama prayed that I wouldn't be Chi-Ali
Now my mama straight cuz I wanted to be Chi-Ali
They say my Jansport strings was tying it all together
My Jansport strings was tying it all together
My Jansport strings was tying it all together
And now that new thing got me riding out for whatever

[Verse 1: Skyzoo]
One time up for Chi-Ali for coming home
Stargazing in the booth, my idol is on parole
Pay it forward when they see my lead to run along
Cause everyone who used to be by me is running blow
And they still rite next to me
Bet it how we get it, if I sketch it how they left it shit is still life weaponry
Pardon my advances, honor me by palming where your hands is
Corners gave us carpe diem answers
And I was by the light pole, Tre Styles caught up in a dice roll
Looping up "maniac pyscho"
Wonder the flow hyped me, nothing or no one like me
As much as I owe to Chi I feel like I owe Lighty
Money was everywhere, the liquor store was the anthem
Murder Chi wrote they went and hit him with cameras
Kings Plaza, talking "age is just a number"
Word to his infrared 6s on the cover mufucka

[Verse 2: Chi-Ali]
One time up for Skyzoo
Got me feeling myself like it's a throwback from 9-2
Back from the dead like it's Easter and I'm Christ
And I'm, here for them checks like the sneakers and them Nikes
Got the penitentiary on my back, they all rooting for me
The whole Brooklyn Court, they all shooting for me
So lick a shot for Mumia in the struggle and
Middle finger to them C.O.'s in the bubble now
I done put my gun up, but that don't mean my run up
I'm just coming home so yo, now it's time to come up
And any nigga tryna stop that, just stop that
I'm on parole now, "yo chill Chi, I got that" (skyzoo)
Well get 'em son cause half these niggas don't even rhyme right
They all lemon, shut 'em down like the Limelight
In hindsight, wish I never pulled that trigger
Rest in peace Sean Po, you will always be my nigga

[Verse 3: Skyzoo]
Begging my mother to take me to the record store
Cassette singles turned me to what y'all never was
Never knew that it would mean what forever does
But it's whatever cause to me it just let us run
I ran to it for the taking that it seemed
How the corner should've bagged me but maybe it was Chi
That was kinda like a reason why the pen started leaking
And now they call me top 10 speaking
To that I tell you all, one time up for Chi-Ali
Cause I could be in a box if I ain't see that screen
My mama prayed that I wouldn't be Chi-Ali
Now my mama straight cuz I wanted to be Chi-Ali
They say my Jansport strings was tying it all together
My Jansport strings was tying it all together
My Jansport strings was tying it all together
And now that new thing got me riding out for whatever
