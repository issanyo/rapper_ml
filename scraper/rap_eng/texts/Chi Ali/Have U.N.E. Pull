[Intro: Chi Ali]
Dag, I wish I was like Jordan
So I could just fly through the air no one could ever stop me
Or, or like Mike Tyson
So I could just knock people's heads off
Naaw, more like Prince
So I could pull all the honeys
Well a brother like Chi Ali is pulling all the honeys anyway
But still, it would be nice

[Verse 1: Dres]
What's going on kid?
It's time for Dres to begin
I see you grinning I'm beginning to think that we're friends
And if we are friends, then we are far from fools
So I will then kiss and
Let you into my sphere, cool?
Now listen I'm known as a Black Sheep
And if you try to pull the cover
And attempt to sleep
You won't get rest nah
You can not sleep on this
For I make noise...see?
But anyway, a life inside a day
Is where I live and though I wish
Therefore[?] I pray with hay
I live on nonetheless
Through progess and regress
I've got my body and my intellect
I'm buddha blessed
Now my "chalant-ness"
Or rather lack of this
You call a spade a spade
Well I will call a spade a kiss
Butt in the meantime
You try to fresh on that
And if the source is yours of course
I get a verbal bat
Until I get through
That we are rich with wealth
Can you understand that you should be yourself?

[Hook] X 2
'Bah bah Black Sheep', have U.N.E. pull
'Bah bah Black Sheep', have U.N.E. pull
'Bah bah Black Sheep', have U.N.E. pull
Or are you full of sheep?
Tryin' to pull the wool

[Verse 2]
What's going on black?
You want a hand to smack?
Well I can never be all that
So I won't give you dap
I do the 'Hey yo'
Your girl is on the strobe?
Oh no that's kind of trip
But gee I gotta go
You see it's not the style of me
So I'm not mending
And I won't pull your leg
Nor start pretending
To be a fair weather
With a plea to cop
'Cause you never let me hold your skelly top
You see it's like this I'll start explaining
Dres is down with self maintaining
Don't say I can't, I know that I can
Black Sheep rule, me and my man
Or my man and I, Mista Lawnge and Dres
Baby sounds are in the sphere
Better do as Chris says
As for me, to say just how
You didn't know me then
So you could never know me now

[Hook] X 2
'Bah bah Black Sheep', have U.N.E. pull
'Bah bah Black Sheep', have U.N.E. pull
'Bah bah Black Sheep', have U.N.E. pull
Or are you full of sheep?
Tryin' to pull the wool

[Verse 3: Dres]
What's going on hon?
You say you're out for fun
I got a pocket full of posies
You say, "I got a gun."
Then take a step back
Away from Flipper
I'd rather shoot you with the joint
Inside my zipper
But not to be fresh
For then I lose the groove
I'd rather see you smile
And move your booty smooth
Then I get to know ya
Got things to show ya
Is there the chance
Of me getting over
And over and over and over and over again?
Now tell me
Are you gonna let me in?
For it's getting hot
What I have have not
Give me a second though
I have a mansion and a yacht
A caddy for my daddy
Somethin' new for mom too
A coat for Mista Lawnge
And some hookers for the crew
Honey don't get mad
You know my love is greater
But, I'll dig you later
