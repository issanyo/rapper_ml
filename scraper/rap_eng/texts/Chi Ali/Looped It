This ain't a twinkle twinkle little star
But this may be the fattest track by far
And still the competition is, eager to listen
I keep shooting, recouping, and yo, forever missing
But I'm getting pissed off, they'd better break now
Cause me and the microphone is gonna shake down
And opposer of rhyme composer
Will forever grow and you know, you should have chose a
Different record, used a different method
It really doesn't matter cause I will still wreck it
I use my wits to outwit the other guy
Before he splits I give the vic another try
Rhymes are rabid like rabies when injected
He got hit with a skid and got infected
He was overconfident, and underbalanced
He tried to bully a brother and got silenced
A sudden outburst, the scene it got worse
I had to ostracize, him from the earth
Banish and exile the kid for a while
Throw him under my wing, and raise him like a child
But never lose stride, pace, or beat
Cause I'm built for the human race, plus I keep
Powerful punchlines, and when it's crunchtime
I still flow real suave, with a plush rhyme

I took a funky beat and I looped it (Looped it)
I took a funky beat and I looped it (Looped it)
I took a funky beat and I looped it
(But your budget it a million) Don't worry, I'll recoup it

And the end of a page, I just flip it
Cause it's 28 more lines for me to get wicked
So I continue to flow and blow MC's out the frame
At the end of the show, you know my name
Plus my trademark's left on the brain's base
An inprint the brother who sparked the place
Left the place in flames, scooped the dames
And what remains is a knucklehead skeleton frame
Chi-Ali the main event
Lyrics are bent and slammed to the pavement
A minute and 15 seconds gone
And the lyrical emporer is just getting warm

I took a funky beat and I looped it (Looped it)
I took a funky beat and I looped it (Looped it)
I took a funky beat and I looped it
(But your budget it a million) Don't worry, I'll recoup it

Still ripping parties with a passion
To move your rump is what brings the cash in
Hands are waving, suckers I hope are saving
All your yelling and swelling, and misbehaving
Head for shelter, but that won't help ya
Cause when I'm hot, I'm bound to melt the
Strongest uranium, and bust the cranium
Don't complain to me, complain to them
Cause soldier couselor, higher a bouncer
Whatever you do, it won't amount to
The force of swiftness, of strength and anger
Major wreckless, potential danger
(To Chi, why do brothers envy thee?)
Maybe because the rhymes flow indefinitely
(What'd you do, Chi?)

I took a funky beat and I looped it (Looped it)
I took a funky beat and I looped it (Looped it)
I took a funky beat and I looped it
(But your budget it a million) Don't worry, I'll recoup it (Repeat 2x)

(But your budget is a million) I told y'all not to worry

This goes out to my man Darren, sup man  (But your budget is a million)

Yo I'm telling y'all stop worrying, I'm
Piad, aiight, I'm blowing up y'all don't
Got to worry                             (But your budget is a million)

Yo, I'm not going to tell y'all no more
I'm outta here, aiight?                  (But your mother is a midget!)

Ayo, what's up with that?
