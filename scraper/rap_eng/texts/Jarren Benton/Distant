[Intro: The Weird One]
I see the pain in your eyes
What are we fighting for?
We were so close before
Now we’re distant

[Verse 1: Jarren Benton]
Inside feel cold and so numb
And I don’t face my fears, I just run
And baby I don’t know how to love you back
I know you're hurt and I’m sorry for that
A lot of disagreements we got
I put duct tape on my conscience’s mouth
Now I’m startin’ to question my heart
And I probably be to blame for everything that decays and falls apart
And you don’t understand these changes in the limelight
They still remain dark
And me and you became strangers
And that began to grow anger
And I don’t know how to reconnect
I know the pain we feeling's gonna change us
We both goin’ through phases
I know you losin’ your patience
I pray and hope that the outcome will put smiles on both of our faces
I’m so distant

[Chorus: The Weird One]
I see the pain in your eyes
What are we fighting for?
We were so close before
Now we’re distant, yeah
You say you’re losing your mind
And now you can’t take it no more
A feeling now you can’t ignore
So distant

[Verse 2: Jarren Benton]
Inside feel down and so low
We used to be in love and so close
Now how the fuck we get down this road?
Now I feel so lost and so cold
(So distant)
I know I’m always gone
And I know that shit probably eats you up
I feel lost when I am back home
And these groupie bitches on some other shit
You wonder why they don’t love ya bitch
As soon as a nigga disappear
They jumpin’ on the next sucka’s dick
Lord, I feel like I lost my soul on this road
And I just keep disconnecting from you more distance, all that we know
The path we on gettin’ deviated
And now ya feelin’ unappreciated
You cry yourself to fall to sleep at night
I drink ‘til I feel inebriated
And me and you became strangers
And that began to grow anger
And I don’t know how to reconnect
I know the pain we feelin’ gonna change us
We both goin’ through phases
I know you losin’ your patience
And I hope and pray that the outcome will put smiles on both of our faces
But we distant, so what the fuck are we fighting for? Huh?
You said that you ain’t lost love for me
I say “What the fuck are we fighting for?”
Huh? You said that you ain’t lost love for me

[Bridge: Jarren Benton]
Inside so cold and so numb
And I don’t face my fears, I just run
Said inside so down and so low
Now I feel so lost and so cold
(So distant)

[Chorus: The Weird One]
I see the pain in your eyes
What are we fighting for?
We were so close before
Now we’re distant, yeah
You say you’re losing your mind
And now you can’t take it no more
A feeling now we can’t ignore
So distant, yeah
