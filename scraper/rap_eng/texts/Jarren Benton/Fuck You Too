[Outro]
Dear lord
Please make it so that no weapon formed against me shall prosper
In the time of my imprecious attack
Make me physically and mentally prepared for anything they might bring my way
Protect me and forgive them for that they know not what they do or say
Give me the power and strength to block the negative energies and loose tongues of haters and naysayers
Cause to hate me is to hate you as for I am one of your children
Also instill in me the wisdom to identify all of my friendemies
And at last but not least teach me how to pray for my enemies
