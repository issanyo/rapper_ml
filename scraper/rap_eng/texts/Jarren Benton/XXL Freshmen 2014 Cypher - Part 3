[Verse 1: Jon Connor]
It’s Jon Connor, the people’s rapper
Uh, look, ey, start with a dream, young and naïve and then they grow the ambition
Fucked up conditions, put my mom’s in a better position
See I’m the future like a psychic prediction
I’m from the school of hard knocks, shit I did life in detention
I’m from where niggas get shot down, dreams get shot down
Wish the hood would let us live but all we heard was “block out”
Now I’m further than what they believed I’d achieve
‘Cause Flint niggas don’t even want you to have dreams when you sleep
Low expectations, no expectations, know what you facing
Fuck the odds I proved you can get up from under a basement
I been with scandalous bitches that will take you for granted
Roll with scandalous niggas only taking advantage
People take your kindness for weakness, taking you through the ringer
It’s a gang bang, life is a bitch and it’s not a pre-nup
Life is dirty, shit box dirty, and we’re playing clean-up
Go through the Ike & Tina, before the Martin & Gina
I play follow the leader and I done swam with the sharks made it out the Aquafina
Niggas turned into leeches, turned these swamps into beaches
My people saying "Eureka!", niggas pretend, they hate you, they despise you, they ain’t you
Niggas is full of shit that’s why they probably empty
God promised a feast how you gon’ tempt me with Denny's
Niggas and bitches rats, stay away from mickey's and minnie’s
I fend for this city, when I ain’t have a friend in this city
Adding in your two cents? I’ll show you what to do with them pennies, look
My intellect been a wreck, crash course on this real shit
In Flint, every day is a Virginia Tech, fuck rating on the internet
Fuck what popping off in comments, pop off in public
My niggas is into that, Jon Connor AVM, Aftermath, best in the world nigga!

[Verse 2: Jarren Benton]
Uh, Jarren Benton, half-man, half-tyrannosaurus
I wasn’t born I was thrown out a spaceship and landed in an abandoned forest
The Grizzly bear trapped Goldilocks in a pan of porridge
I carve my name in ya fuckin’ scalp, you can’t ignore us
Go get a damn thesaurus, the preacher, the son of God
Only way you fuckin’ with Mister Benton, no façade
I put a man in the desert sand, that’s no mirage
I go gambit on niggas and pull your poker cards
I go loco mark open heart surgery, with no power tools
A fuckin’ monster, I will devour you
I’m Cujo and cocaine with rabies in them
These kids dying like Casey Anthony babysitting
I’ll fuckin’ fuckin’ rip  your tonsils out
And throw your dead corpse in a tool shed in my uncle’s house
I got love for Lil' Boosie but free Mumia
These niggas signing like three-sixty deals for two New Kias
Shit, TLC got a Rav-4
You might catch me in a Prius with a bad whore
I snatch a rapper out the sunroof of a Jaguar
You ain’t a spitter, then what the fuck do you rap for?
Niggas like “I ain’t a rapper, I’m a trapper”
Then stay inside the trap or get eaten by the fuckin’ master
Of ceremonies, it's hip hop, with a gold rope and a pair of ponies
Can't grab a bitch by the ponytail ‘cause the hair is phony
Moving from African Gods to Amistad
To niggas going broke and still stuntin' in they momma’s car
It’s FV twenty-one-four, the summer’s ours
And you a bitch in a woman’s skirt, son of a coward
The fireman, I extinguish these niggas out fast
I grew up off of Red, Em, Goodie Mob, and Outkast
I keep the Wu-Tang sword propped on the front seat
That’s your favorite rapper? To me that nigga just lunch meat
Jarren Benton, Rest in Peace Jahmal Pryor

[Verse 3: Lil Bibby]
Uh, Let me talk my shit
Bands in my pocket so I walk like this
Just spent 80 grand when I bought my whip
Lou told me to lease it but I bought my shit
And I came in the game like LeBron James
First the money, and the fame, then the broads came
See your clique, fifty deep, but they all lame
Young nigga stacking books like a card game
They like “How the fuck is he a freshman?”
Young nigga spitting better than the veterans
I need the cover, why the fuck I gotta sit with them?
The whole world know these words ain't compared to him
Uh, yeah the kid’s so cocky, feeling like Ali
Niggas can’t stop me, jackers wanna rob me
Opps wanna pop me, that's why I keep a lil’ bro right beside me
I’m from the Chi, shit real in this motherfucker
Fuck around, get killed in this motherfucker
Paranoid, I can’t chill in this motherfucker
Can’t leave without the steel in this motherfucker
These niggas keep saying “Don’t trip”
Climbing to the top, I just hope I don’t slip
Niggas sending threats and I never been a bitch
So I’m steady buying guns, youngin feeling like tilt
Lil’ Bibby I’m the same old pimp
No more Ramen Noodles, just lobsters and shrimp
I could be in jail tryna talk through them vents
Or running from the cops, probably hopping a fence
But, I’m in the drop with the tints
Flow so sick it don’t make no sense
Niggas be mad I don’t take no pics
Chain so froze I could take your bitch
But I don’t even need ice though
And this that eighty-four mic flow
We don’t rap beef, my squad a little psycho
Plus these rap niggas suck like Lipo
I ain’t forgot about the old me
Straight off the block now I’m ballin’ like Kobe

[Verse 4: Troy Ave]
Troy Ave, with the classic feel
Bands be racking, major without a deal
I’m that nigga, if you got eyes you could tell
You’re seeing me rise, you're seeing me with XX-L
Putting on for my city and I’m doing it well
So much style I should be down with The Stylistics as well
This like BIG and Jay, Troy Ave hit after
I represent the streets, I ain’t these weirdo rapper
Self-paid nigga came from whipping the batter
Hit the bank they like “Who is this young stacker?”
HP, PSB, HE, double-L yes, oh baby, yeah, it’s me
Ho spillers, smooth skinner, dope dealer
Mad niggas be out in New York, my buzz iller
I’m an ill nigga, Dungarees by Hilfiger
As a lil’ nigga coming up, now I’m bigger
In the dope game, then these fraud niggas with rap names
I’m named after my block, Troy Ave mane
Chitty Chitty Bang Bang, still in this street thang
We’ll be at the Barclays, Nets vs. Heat game
Man, where these other niggas seats man?
Man, these seats ain’t cheap, man
These other niggas weak, man
Talking ‘bout they proud of me
Pay attention to my moves but I style for free
These bum nigga styles ain’t no style to me
Dickriding never been transportation, B
Powder, Troy Ave biz, we reckless
New York City shit, uh huh
