Another day, another misfortune
I cannot afford to lose my place
Cause when I step outside I can feel it
We could be close to the end and I can’t help it

[Verse 1: Jarren Benton]
You a bitch if you hating on this shit
I grew up off of Southernplayalisticadillacmusik
The everyday bullshit can make a nigga reclusive
I give you all the exclusives, I’m twisting dope like a Rubik’s
(yeah) cube, nigga take a walk in my shoes
Come deal with my paranoia, I’m so scared I might lose
Sip a couple light brews that might lighten my mood
At least for my baby’s sake I pray I make the right moves
I feel like God with a murderous ink pen
About to put a couple hollow points in your ink skin
Rappers you fugazi, we can see that you pretend
Butter soft, leather in the seats that I’m sinking
Welcome to the mind of Mr. Benton
The fuck is these niggas sniffing?
The verbal serial killer just itching to stick this clip in
Niggas nothing different, same shit, different porcelain
Thank God we walked up out that abortion clinic
Old school Chevy, the windows tinted
Another homicide, 12 need more forensics
The fact is, pigs murdering black kids
And black kids murdering black kids
Ay where the value in that?
It’s like we don’t see no value in black
A fatherless habitat, moving vials of that crack

Another day, another misfortune

[Verse 2: Jarren Benton]
Yeah, ATLiens
I told the pastor to pray for them
Lost souls, communities broken, can’t find a way for them
Niggas still waiting on God to sky dive
Like that's our only hope to stop these drive-bys
Ain't no action heroes, a bunch of misguided negros
We scared of our own so we sleep with guns under pillows
And ADT alarms, they don't mean no harm
And I'm guilty of it too, I profile niggas like um
What this nigga up to? Damn he lookin' shady
Is he casing my crib while I'm clutchin' on the 3.80?
Meanwhile he's just tryna find the local gymnasium
We assume the worse and we plant these seeds in our cranium
Damn that’s that same mindframe that killed Trayvon
But we don’t think shit bout the bitch when she selling Avon
Wake up, something going on my niggas
We murder over dumb shit, still miss the big picture
Psychological damage planted in our genes
How’d we go to this when we used to be kings and queens
Meanwhile the African population decreasing over bullshit diseases
Hunger and shit that’s mean’less
That’s weird, the most hated and feared
Open your third eye, there’s something going on here
Slavery mind state still controlling most of y’all head
Ask Malcolm, when you wake from the matrix they want you dead
