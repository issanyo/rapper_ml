[Intro]
Yeah
Yo Spittz you know what fucking kills me?
When I be hearing motherfuckers saying
Yo I had a fucked up day
My day this, my day that
But nigga I'm like shut the fuck up nigga
Nobody had a more fucked up day than me, you know what I'm saying?
And I ain't bullshitting about this, this some crazy shit
So y'all sit back, bring out the popcorn, and listen, alright?
Put the children to bed, pop two pills, take a couple shots to the head
Sit back and listen
Check this shit out

[Verse 1]
Uh
Raised in Decatur
Hung around skaters
Stomp a nigga out with my Charlie Brown gators
Your mom said I raped her
Cause I duck taped her
And she woke up next to me passed out holding a razor
I'm on some bad pack shit
Sick of this rap shit
Sick of being stuck in this Atlanta traffic
Hop out of my car
I walk to the bar
Order Hangar 1 in a real big jar
I spit a couple bars
I met a bitch with SARS
We huffed a tube of glue until we started seeing stars
She took me up to Mars
I met a guy named Charles
With two wooden legs and some nasty war scars
I went back home and popped two Pop-Tarts
That's when I heard a voice saying AllƒÅhu Akbar
Open the front door and there's my homie Clyde
I said what's up and gave him a high five
Maybe we'll get high
Maybe we'll sky dive
I looked at the clock and it's a quarter past five
My nigga's acting weird
He started scratching his beard
I started getting scared cause ooze dripped from his ear
His mouth started foaming, his eyes turned red
I grabbed the kitchen knife and stuck it in his head
He passed out dead
I grabbed him by the legs
Drug him outside and stuck him in a tool shed
Went back to the house
And sat on a couch
Watched Golden Girls marathon until I passed out
Woke up the next morning with drool on my chin
It's a new day and I do this shit again
I know what you're thinking, he's a fucking liar
I hope he freaking dies, goes to hell and burns in fire
The moral of the story, there is none dammit
I'm a dope rapper and my name is Jarren
I vouch for myself, this guy's sick
The fucking Beatgods, they make hits
If you got a label please sign me quick
But first you got to find me and suck my dick
