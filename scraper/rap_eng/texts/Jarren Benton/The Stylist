[Verse 1]
I whipped the beamer out in Vegas yelling 2Pac back
Bitch, I'm a problem what the fuck can niggas do bout that
These rappers too funny, Bitches change cause I got new money
I through a stack at that hoe and tell her go do laundry
Fucking deranged money stuffed in the bank
Mink coat killa got PETA throwing buckets of paint
Ah fuck it, I make a fashion statement on the red carpet
You fuck with my mine and get your head target
I take a back in the book with egg cartons get your head carved in
I write my words past the red margin, fuck it
Whores give me [?] tyrannosaurus rex
I'm a monster I peel off in the vintage orange vest
You know how the god do it
Cotton money

Sloppy hoes wanna know what I [?]
