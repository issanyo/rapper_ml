Kato on the track, bitch

[Hook: Jarren Benton]
Face down, ass up
Go on and get your paper baby, gas up
Gas up, gas up
Gas up, gas up
Man down, act up
Whole lotta gang shit, gas up
Gas up, gas up
Gas up, gas up

[Verse 1: Jarren Benton]
Mask up, gas up
If you a broke-ass nigga, better back up
She gon' work that pony, get her Bachelors
Part that pussy for a bag up, get ya cash up
Fall up in this bitch like a 100 strong
Drop a thong and hit a bitch with the money phone
Gas up, gas up
Got a stick, in case a monkey nigga act up

[Verse 2: Emilio Rojas]
Lil mama ass fat and she got a thong in it
I ain't gon' judge it, ain't nothin' wrong with it
She twerkin' when her favorite song spinnin'
She hit a motherfucker on the way up, she got Solange with it
Mamacita is a [?]
If dudes trickin' on her that is what she use to
She on the IG posin' with the shootas
I'm in the back, chillin', watchin' 'em maneuver, yeah

[Hook: Jarren Benton]
Face down, ass up
Go on and get your paper, baby, gas up
Gas up, gas up
Gas up, gas up
Man down, act up
Whole lotta gang shit, gas up
Gas up, gas up
Gas up, gas up

[Verse 3: Price]
Uh, on the road to riches, got it mapped up
A hundred on the Uber for the black truck
Been drinkin' Gatorade, you last up
Ballin' like I'm Kyrie with the mask, yeah
She swallow the evidence, don't leave shell cases
If you betray Price, I know hell waitin'
I'm 91 gassed up, Shell station, ooh
I jumped behind her fast, yeah I'm tailgatin'
Yeah, I be dancin' on that ass, I don't like waitin'
Her homegirl know the clique like this real quick
Take a break now, for the takedown
Look good in that waist, take a body brace now
Goin' in, put your

[Hook: Jarren Benton]
Face down, ass up
Go on and get your paper baby, gas up
Gas up, gas up
Gas up, gas up
Man down, act up
Whole lotta gang shit, gas up
Gas up, gas up
Gas up, gas up

[Verse 4: Dizzy Wright]
If I'm kickin' game to her then she top of the line
You speakin' to a king, you better follow the signs
Gassed up, look I'm just tryna fill up the tank
Ass fat, too bad it ain't as real as we think
Back it up tho, cautious 'cause I've been that route
Freaky but she beautiful from the inside out
Smoke out the whole freeway with the windows down
These vintage clothes will make you think the Nintendo's out
I told lil mama better take it or leave
She whispered in my ear, "that's the motivation I need"
Why you playing with me?
You just wanna see me spend some, when the rent come
She gon' have that ass

[Hook: Jarren Benton]
Face down, ass up
Go on and get your paper baby, gas up
Gas up, gas up
Gas up, gas up
Man down, act up
Whole lotta gang shit, gas up
Gas up, gas up
Gas up, gas up
