[Verse 1: Jarren Benton]
We used to love each other now we argue, fuss and fight
Throwing dishes at a nigga, that ain't fuckin' right
I'm paranoid, I go to sleep I gotta tuck a knife
Cause she might take my life in the middle of the night
I shouldn't have cheated, I'm sorry 'bout the side bitches
But I was cursed with a dick, baby, my mind's twisted
Psych, that's no excuse for the bullshit
But honestly I didn't believe that you weren't doin' shit
Uh, and now she want me out the house
She tell a nigga "Bounce," she got me sleepin' on the couch
And my kids like "Damn, the living room is dad's home"
Dissin' on that nigga loading his shows, you mad wrong
Damn, ain't nothing like a broke heart
Threw my exclusive kicks and shit in the front yard
It gets major, four months later
She can't stand a nigga drawin' up divorce papers

[Chorus: Bingx]
She been mad ever since Monday
And it's already Sunday
I mean tomorrow make a week of it
She don't wanna speak of shit
But you don't give a fuck about that, though
She don't give a fuck about that, though
You don't give a fuck about that, no, no, no
I know I made mistakes, I'm beggin' you to stay, girl
But you don't give a fuck about that

[Verse 2: Jarren Benton]
She moving on, now a nigga gettin' jealous
Ass gettin' fatter, did it for the new fella
Aye, newsletter, what the fuck can you tell her?
Bitch, I ain't doing bad, shit, I'm stackin' new cheddar
I still wanna split the nigga's wig
Don't suck a nigga's dick then go home and kiss the kids
Cause that'd be some real foul shit
I hope all ya teeth fall out ya mouth, bitch
Lord knows, I'm sorry I wasn't loyal
Ya sister hate me but ya momma still cordial
I pray to god we find happiness
Aye, we deserve it, we carried a lot of baggages
Uh, I hope the kids are just swell
Don't date no lames that wear sandals and neck shells
Time pass, we enjoyin' our life
Aye, once upon a time I called you my wife
And now we out

[Chorus: Bingx] (x2)
