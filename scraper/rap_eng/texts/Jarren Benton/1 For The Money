[Hook: Pounds]x2
1 for the money
2 for the bass
3 for them boys with the (whoo) on they waist
1 for the money, 1, 1 for the money
2 for the, 2, 2 for the bass

[Verse 1: Pounds]
Look
P the commissioner
Best since Christopher
Put it on your head like conditioner
You should hit the minister
I'm-a put the ?
Get sick of a bitch
Twister her
Like 26 kick flips to the face
Grand finale shit, 100 quick clips with a chase
I'm the reason for cheese, please be the cash cow
?
Higher than some 3 dollar seats in the bleachers
I'm a beast so I sleep with the creatures
Rap about them highs and the blow, I don't care man
I put you in the sky for the low, like air train
Hop up in the booth and go Anthony Hopkins
I don't give a shit with your family watchin'
It's all hip-hop, the blood trickle
Oh my ?

[Hook]x2

[Verse 2: Jarren Benton]
Allergic to fake shit
D's on the spaceship
God's favorite son, yet I'm caught up in the Matrix
Dr. Benton here to give the game a face lift
I'm off of the chain like I escaped from a slave ship
I...don't...like
99.9 percent of y'all faggots on the mic
Fuck what you heard
If you ain't the Neptune then more than likely I ain't fucking with you nerds
I'm gone off the syrup
And I am not referrin' to Aunt Jemima nor Mrs. Butterworth
I got a white bitch I call Lindsay Nohan
Cause when she sucks dick the bitch uses no hands
Oh man!
What a feelin'
I'm high as an alien and dancing on the ceilin'
I'm gonna make a billion...
Dollars, so when I'm in the dirt I can have something to leave to my children
Cowabunga dude
Whores, they adore me, but bitch you only love me because of my cool
"What you up to?"
No good
I'm straight from Decatur but I'm not so hood
I'm more-so psycho
More like Michael...
Myers, Jarren Benton bitch, I'm on fire
Sucka ass niggas, she call me sire
And I won't stop rocking until I retire
