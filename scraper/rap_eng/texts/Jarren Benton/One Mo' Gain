[Verse 1: Jack Harlow]
I said I'm lemonade chill, with a hand squeeze feel
In the kitchen making sure the pantry's filled
Everybody wanna know bout what's going on next, but I'm never ever going into grand detail
What you bulls gon' do when the stampede chills
Thinking bout the future and I can't keep still
Yo my cup runneth over need a damn refill
Keep a draw hundred dressing full of Plan B pills, and I'm
Getting better by the day
I've been running through the pressure, I ain't never been afraid
If I want it, I'ma get it, I don't let it get away
And as far as I'm concerned what you telling me they saying
They ain't never really say it, they ain't said it to my face
Ya'll be lying bout the women that you say that you been fucking
Only thing you ever came, it was second in a race
Quit bullshitting, yeah she got the cake I just wanna cool whip it
All that inauthentic, [?] sound fool with it
In my bucket life, gotta couple strict rules in it
Number 1, follow your gut
Number 2, you ain't doing nothing wrong if it's fun
Number 3, if she bleeding put it all in her butt
And number 4, only one of those I follow is one, so

[Hook: Smoov Wooz] (x2)
One mo' gain, one mo' gain
One mo' gain, one mo' gain
Thought I'd tell you random fuckers with it
Guess I gotta tell em one mo' gain

[Verse 2: Smoov Wooz]
If the pussy head on, no Geico
Now they wonder where I come from Catenaccio
I'm the one these hating niggas looking at, crook-ed
Cos I could take your bitch like I study, crook-ed
I'ma saw you niggas even if Jerry tell me I'm not
Her father used to be hot, and bother with the same ho's wanna get my cock
I swear, because I got the juice now, I drop the deuce now, shit on niggas like, ugh!
Sorry couldn't make it to the potty
For the verse you gotta pay in mariachi, that's a bank if you didn't know
Man, I'm just tryna get a pocket full of Piccolo
Or you can check my ding-a-ling like a birthday candle, give my dick a blow
Nah mean, oh wait, she going down on me like a sink, her shit thought I told you niggas before
Don't be a pain, I'm an eeyore
Guess I [?] on you niggas, I really be going in
I kick it [?] you niggas really making a master like with Kato on a keyboard
Listen to me with it, let me see you shake your booty cheeks
In slow motion, they call me Smoov Wooz
If you don't love it kick a bucket till your toes broke in

[Hook: Smoov Wooz] (x2)
One mo' gain, one mo' gain
One mo' gain, one mo' gain
Thought I'd tell you random fuckers with it
Guess I gotta tell em one mo' gain

[Verse 3: Jarren Benton]
It still tricking if you got it (got it)
Ya'll pay for pussy only if these ho's bought it (bought it)
Some of these girls pussy really got some mileage, and I love it when I feel like I don't wanna get up out it
Then these ho's hit your ass with a baby for the summer (what?!)
Hang up the phone like, "Bitch, wrong number!"
These girls want a ring, with a big stone under
Bitch can't rise like a flintstone hummer, listen
Gone with that Beyonce shit, you ain't my fiance bitch
You're fucking up feng shui bitch, I'm hot like a sun ray bitch
You're throwing shade but in a Hyundai bitch, really?
I dropped outta Cooley High, I'm still stunting in some gucci slides
I'm watching New Jack, and they cry when Pookie die
That's what you get when you rant into a suit and tie, it's a homicide
I passed a ho to Jack Harlow, came up niggas slam Cadillac cars though
I dumb it through the cheque Well's Fargo, ho's want a nigga pay the bills in the condo
I told that bitch to stick her head down a sharks throat
Pimp shit nigga, where your heart though?
We bout to get that long money like hard folk
Don't make my niggas draw the heat like a art Show

[Hook: Smoov Wooz] (x2)
One mo' gain, one mo' gain
One mo' gain, one mo' gain
Thought I'd tell you random fuckers with it
Guess I gotta tell em one mo' gain
