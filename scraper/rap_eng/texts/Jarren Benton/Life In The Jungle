[Hook:]
Live fast, die young in the jungle
How the fuck you still standing?
When the ground beneath you crumbles
That's how they want you
You can make it if you want to
Learn to live with your regrets when they come haunt you
It's life in the jungle
Aye, aye, aye
It's life in the jungle
Aye, aye, aye
Don't let me die

[Verse 1:]
High school drop out, I was so young
Just so I could rap, damn I was so dumb
Met a coke head older bitch, I was so sprung
Popped pills, then put a lot of dope in our lungs
Damn, didn't mean to disappoint my mom
Hit a couple licks, then throw away the gun
Never doing time in the state, now we all fucked up
Damn, should've been on my way to prom
Life of a young black teen
Not my kids where the fucking vaccine
Streets turn some niggas to a crack fiend
Had dreams you would hit the line, like rapp-ing
All my niggas so soft in heart
I was in the basement, trynna' practice my art
Life is a beach with a ocean, with sharks
Don't let 'em smell blood, they'll tear you apart
Worst fear: I would turn to be nothin'
Least in my kids eyes I would mean somethin'
Paranoid like a motherfucker seen somethin''
That a scared nigga straight, motherfucker I ain't frontin'
Yes I'm king, young black teen
Throwed off from the bullshit that I've seen
Wait for my nightmare, I live my dreams
Still here bitch, ready for whatever life brings

[Hook:]
Live fast, die young in the jungle
How the fuck you still standing?
Gonna crumble if you tumble
That's how they want you
You can make it if you want to
Learn to live with your regrets when they come haunt you
It's life in the jungle
Aye, aye, aye
It's life in the jungle
Aye, aye, aye
Don't let me die

[Verse 2:]
Sorry y'all, but I was off that night
High as hell, I could've lost my life
What the fuck am I smoking?
What you put in that pipe?
That's PCP nah nigga that ain't right
Confronted my fears right by the moonlight
I was so geeked couldn't even move right
I was so scared, felt God that night
Bless you and me, ACHOO, Gesundheit
Amazed how a nigga made it
Without land on the pavement, and locked in cages
We all go through phases
And roam through hell and hopes someone saves us
Came up from the east, lex, and gold teeth
Chevy's, old school Capri's, running from the police
Some didn't make it like Cochise
My homeboy died over old beef
Yeah, not Salmonella
Rolled around that night looking for the killer
Came back home, boy get it together
What the fuck am I doin', boy chase somethin' better
Try a whole new angle
Levitate through the bullshit, Chris Angel
Must be touched by angels
Bro got a loose foot, gripping this angle
Life in the jungle

[Hook:]
Live fast, die young in the jungle
How the fuck you still standing?
Gonna crumble if you tumble
That's how they want you
You can make it if you want to
Learn to live with your regrets when they come haunt you
It's life in the jungle
Aye, aye, aye
It's life in the jungle
Aye, aye, aye
Don't let me die

[Verse 3:]
Life in the jungle, we scrambling just to make it
Dr. Conrad Murray niggas losin' they patients
Can't find a decent job with good wages he's on probation
Baby momma bitchin' 'bout paper, fuck he can't take it
Stress is kickin' in, and this pain and his heart is achin'
Don't wanna fuckin' lose it, his faith is slowing decayin'
Momma constantly prayin', hope the angels can save him
Poppa was never there, so these fuckin' animals raise him
No decent role models, these dope boys they craze him
Cops patrol the block with no empathy, they just gauge him
Same old cycle, we been through this shit for ages
We question the presence of God, shit is just never changin'
In the jungle
