[Intro]
Yo, Sir Skitzo

Verse 1: CHVSE
Look
Do we gotta problem?
Should we try to solve 'em?
Music harder than rock bottom
Rest in peace to the live of funk volume
Legends never die so you won't be forgotten
Yeah!
Perfect symmetry on beats
Got the public leaning on their seats
Heated MCs says trees till he sees
That these simple pieces
That no more need to be on a leash
So be gone and my flow be strong
Show whats wrong but I know we gone
This hopeless song upon
Which I would write but the public would not respond
Killing an innocent victim of rap
You will not win in this race
If a bitch is thinking of calling me dad
Imma have to commit they Casey Anthony case
Get quick then imma smash in your face
I'm a sick prick plus the jack of all trades
Spit a lymerick then attack with grenades
Somehow I was never passing in grades
Trying to draw some attention
My music has started to get so depressing
Now that I got Jarren Benton
My career is headed in the right direction
I'm the definition
Of a real fucking winner
I'm an intermediate yet your still stuck down at a beginner
Eating these mainstream rappers
That ive seen for dinner
Imma turn you dicks to pussies
I ain't talking about Bruce Jenner

[Chorus]
Time to go to live with this
No-one is equivalent
Me and jarren hit the beat and people say we killing it
All of our rhymes are limitless
Stripping you of your innocence
The shit we say just proves to the public
We are infamous..

[Jarren]
Yeah
What up doe
Back in this motherfucker
JARREN B-B-B-B
I ain't saying my last name
Yall niggas know what time it is Let's go
Yeah Uh
Nigga i'm infamous Jarren you ignorant
I'll write the sickest with a knights penmanship
I dont repent for shit
On some pamper shit
Eat some shrimp and grits
Like dont fuck with my temperment
Slap the cut of his legments
Bitch you ballin you hit the bitch
Underground like we in the trench
All my bitches are immigrants
I say fuck it im done with drugs
All the haters can stomach us
Fuck him up til he vomit blood
All the fans showing tons of love
Man i feel like my lungs go bust
Oh my god what the fuck am i smoking yall
Fuck the protocol
In this bitch in some overalls
Hand grenade in the mortar saw
Fuck i might cut your torso off
Pussy nigga we know you saw
Make them bouce like a pogo ball
Gettin money man m,y show go flawless
Sp eat a rapper up with mojo sauce
The full four knock his logo off
Click Clack now his flow so soft
Yeah, like, See ya later
Niggas shootin through the preset
Now thepreacher they can reach them
Talking bitches into three-some
Kicking ass like liam neeson
Told you niggas i dont fuck around i living form the ground
The illest nigga coming form my town
I kick the door and come in unannounced
Middle finger to my nemesis
My middle fingers up to censorship
Im living life with no limits bitch
It's Mr.Benton bitch im infamous

[Chorus]
Time to go to live with this
No-one is equivalent
Me and jarren hit the beat and people say we killing it
All of our rhymes are limitless
Stripping you of your innocence
The shit we say just proves to the public
We are infamous..

[Sir Skitzo]
Get my point across
That you're crucified
My emotions are utilised
So I'm euthanized
But my suicide
Cause when you live this life
Is either do or die
Questioning if my
Noose will fit
I'm veteran
I ain't new to it
Took your bitch
And then I threw a fit
Because her uterus
Smelled like tuna fish
And that's Ludacris
So lemme call your bluff
Kick your ribs until I pop your lungs
That stupid chick
Didn't drop the gun
So now they call me kirk
Cause I was shot by love
From a shotgun
Now I'm bleeding out
Cock it back and put it in my mouth
Pull the trigger brains paint the sky
While my family's still tryna figure out on
Why I did it, died from living
Cause if lives great then why'd I quit it
Lick a fuse and then my mind was sickened
Till they heard my songs and realised I spit it
Ive been in it till the end
But I never stay intelligent
Loosing my mind like a bitch
Whose getting syphilis
Yo i only rap
Cause the citizens are into it
So I guess that my minds
Staying infamous
