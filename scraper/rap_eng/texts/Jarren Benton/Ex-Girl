Tryna get me out to the club
They say I’ll have fun but I can’t imagine how
Cause just seen my ex-girl standing with my next girl standing with the girl that I’m fuckin right now
Tryna get me out to the club
They say I’ll have fun but I can’t imagine how
Cause just seen my ex-girl standing with my next girl standing with the girl that I’m fuckin right now

[Nikal Feildz]
And they all want the same thing
I tell’em that I got it cause I gets it
But they ain’t wanna listen
And now they say I’m different
They see my picture when they open up the magazine and my kicks all clean
With my fitted on lean
It seems, success just walked in the room
I assume they can smell the aroma
Enough to put a skunk in a coma
I used to wanna bone her, but nowadays I don’t wanna touch her
Let alone fuck her she played me for a sucker back then
But then, she heard I was fuckin her friend
And then, she tried to reconcile the differences
But I just wanna fuck her other friend
They try to get me out to the club
They say I’d have fun but they really know now
Cause once I walk in the door they realise that I fucked’em all
Now they lookin at each other like wooow

[Coach]
Look
It was all good a week ago
Monday was Monday on Sunday unspeakable
Everything in order nothing getting out of line
I bring another meaning to the word quality time
So, I’m not blind I know about the games
And the feelings in between, not one of these lames
I’m not ashamed, I kept shit a hundred
Not tryna Chris Brown situations gotta run it
A lot of shawtys mad cause they think a nigga fronted
Give a couple dick shit that’s all they really wanted
Got a couple gifts and they sick cause they trick
Pissem all off cause I wouldn’t take a lick
My niggas tryna get me out to the club
They say they won’t come but I can’t imagine how
My name is on the flyer, records gettin higher
And they wanna see how a nigga livin now
Wow

[Jarren Benton]
Yeah
Now hello girl how are you
As usual I am cool
Don’t fall in love with no pussy I am no Pepe Le Pew
She cook up that with just [?]
A couple shots and I’m through
Just call me Summer Eve baby cause I’m so into you, and you, and you
Peww
Lets hit my address
Now I should be duckin these hoes like Aflac
Instead I’m tryna get drunk then have sex
Bitch, tryna get me to cash checks
That’s like a midget tryna deepthroat a giraffes neck
Now shawty let me beat beat beat
David Blaine disappear when I skeet skeet skeet
They try to get me out to the club
They say I’ll have fun but I don’t know how
Until I see my ex-girl chillin with my next girl
Know they both down to put my dick in they mouth
Yeah!
