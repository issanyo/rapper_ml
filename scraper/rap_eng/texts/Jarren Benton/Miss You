If you knew

[Verse 1]
Yeah, another day away from home
Yeah homesick, I'm gazin' at your faces on the phone
I know it seems like I've been gone away for way too long
I miss y'all every second, that I breathe so please hold on
Appreciate you for holdin' me down when I'm on tour
I know it takes a toll on you some days, see I'm not sure that
I can do what you do if I was in your shoes
Never take y'all for granted, that's too much for me to lose
Never thought that livin' dreams would be this hard
Might be rockin' shows, but they don't know the sting inside my heart
From being far away from the ones you dearly love
My homies say I'm trippin', "my nigga go live it up"
There's not enough drugs in the world to give me a buzz
That keep me from missin' y'all every day, it's too much
I'm countin' down every single day till I get home
Only if you knew how much I miss you, baby sing the song

[Verse 2]
Uh, I know lately we grown apart
Had our differences in thangs but you still remain in my heart
Remember rushin' home from school to see ya
My momma say I spend too much time with you, I should leave ya
I sit beside the speaker, I listen to every word that you speak of
I was high from your presence, it's like the world was beneath us
I dropped outta school to be with you
You broke my heart so many times, but damn couldn't believe it's true
You said I was too weird and you movin' on, the words had me blue in tone
I thought that you would never change, I guess I was proven wrong
Another sad love song, I guess all the trust gone
I'm feelin' so inadequate like "damn what the fuck's wrong"
I dedicated all my time and sacrificed my life for you
Gambled with my family, even almost left my wife for you
Thought it was me, but you the one cursed with the issues
I don't love you like I used to, but goddamn I really miss you (Hip-Hop)

[Verse 3]
Dedicate this to those who lost someone that they love
Forever livin' through, watch their energy rise above
I know it's hard to cope and I hope that you holdin' on
Can't fathom all your pain, just know that you not alone
No words can okay the sorrow you feelin'
I can't imagine the pain of someone losin' they children
Damn, that shit gotta hit like a Mack Truck
How the hell you have the will to live and get back up
I hope you know you in our prayers, may y'all reunite by Heaven's stairs
Hope the most beautiful angel hold your hand and take you there
I wish that every day gets easier
I hope that all that hurtin' that you feel get to easin' up
Man I'm sorry, I wish it didn't happen to you
I wish you nuttin but the best, I wish I wasn't rappin' to you
Damn, cry so much we need a billion box of tissues
Send a kiss up to the clouds, I hold y'all know we really miss you
