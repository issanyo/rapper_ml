[Intro: Michael Mando]
Did I ever tell you the definition of insanity?

[Jarren Benton]
Fucking insanity got me about to murder these rappers
Let's get 'em

[Verse 1: Kasland]
This is how I make an entrance when I'm about flip a nut
I don't even spit a sentence on the track and rip it up
People say I'm so offensive, do you see me give a fuck
Feeling so damn apprehensive man I should have given up
I started this shit thinking walk in the park
Just give me one year I'll be topping the charts
I knew I was wrong when I shot in the dark
And the only thing I missed were the marketing parts
Now I'm making that change so I target your hearts
Classy with a rough past so pardon the marks
Started making enemies everywhere that I went
Now I howl at the moon and I bark at the stars
Yeah, now it's like this shit's a part of me
I tried to take a look into my future, but it's hard to see
So pardon me for running blind and swinging at an artery
I had to face my fears, now do you think that you can startle me
Nah, and these people can not handle me
I keep expecting shit to change, but wait a minute, can it be
The fact I stay on repeat be why no one's understanding me
Hey Jarren, (What up Kasland?) I think this shit defines insanity

[Hook: Kasland]
And it goes like that, and it goes like that
And it goes like that, then it goes right back
And it goes like that, and it goes like that
And it goes like that, then it goes right back

[Verse 2: Jarren Benton]
While you rappers was having periods I was just building pyramids
That shit you spit is gibberish, frivolous, I ain't hearing it
Stick a dick in your mouth bitch and go shove a beer in it
Fuck an exorcist, head spin around like a pirouette
Fuck y'all, lick taint, sick enough to lick paint
Sniff 'cane with Whitney or Rick James
What you mean now bitch I ain't insane
I ain't never signed with Tech, but I been strange
Bad-a-boom bad-a-bang got a room by the lake
I'm tripping like fuck off the shrooms that I ate
She don't swallow cum so she stroke on my dick
Let me spew it in her face
Yeah, Jesus Christ I'm so fucking nice
Crown me the illest rapper that have clutched the mic
Your momma go buy me some gators if I fuck her right
She let me cut her all night and I ain't even touch a knife
My city's sleeping got me pissed off and sick
These rappers couldn't hang if they was Rick Ross' tits
I'll wipe a haters fucking lip gloss off my dick
And I murder everything so you can just call it quits, bitch

[Hook: Kasland]

[Verse 3: Kasland]
I offer all my mind and if you pass then you'll miss out
They said to turn it up so now we're blasting it this loud
I say we live it up cause it's the last day I'm in town
Plus I'm rich now, can finally ask Taylor Swift out
Nah, I'm serious, will you date me Taylor
Us together would be flyer than an aviator
Plus you're rich could pay for dinner and could save me paper
Then can write your next song and you can thank me later
I'm a dick and a half
What can I say I'm not afraid of people kicking my ass
I'm moving on with my career while y'all just live in the past
So take another hot production and let me rip it in half, let's go

[Hook: Kasland]
