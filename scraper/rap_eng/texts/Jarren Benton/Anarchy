[Intro]
We gone tear this bitch up!
We gone tear that bitch up!

[Verse 1: Jarren Benton]
Yeah
Still motherfuck police
We been on that
Till our motherfuckin' nose bleeds
24/7 nigga we ain't gettin' no sleep
Tear the fuckin' city up
Ride for a whole week
Walk around town with a chopper
Gotta keep a round for the coppers
Hit the genocide and kill a nigga every second
We ain't scared we gone pull it out and break em out (brick em)
Man down, they done let the gas out
Fuck retreating bitch we goin' hard until we pass out
My nigga doing fed time
They just hit the stash house
Ain't no picture for the dope
Man you better cash out
And the niggas steady fillin' up the prison
We just tryna' make a better livin'
So they take the father out the home and leave the baby with no guidance and they wonder why these young niggas trippin'

[Bridge: Jarren Benton]
They say there ain't no hope for a young nigga
They said they wouldn't make it past 21
So we walk around with the guns nigga
In the jungle, know you can't trust anyone
So they march around town with the choppers
Gotta keep a round for the coppers
Hit the genocide and killin' niggas every second
We ain't scared they gone put us in the dirt

[Hook: Jarren Benton]
We gone tear that bitch up!
We gone tear that bitch up!
We gone tear that bitch up!
We gone tear that bitch up!
We gone tear that bitch up!
We gone tear that bitch up!
We gone tear that bitch up!
We gone tear that bitch up!
We gone tear that bitch up!
We gone tear that bitch up!
Hit the genocide and killin' niggas every second
We ain't scared they gone put us in the dirt

[Verse 2: EarthGang]
Bitch we ride with the fire round this motherfucker
Take a look outside
Revolution has arrived
Every single thing I touch get ignited in this motherfucker
Hear my ma no cries, decides, but screams to seem
To strangle, banned to think to turn the blindest eye
I try, I try, I try, I dream
A day when Dr. King
Can come out of fire
Tired up, fired up, fed up
What you think we scared of?
Tell me what a savage look like?
Is his eyes blue or brown? What his granny cook like?
When it all goes down, is you standing up?
Is you man enough?
If you ain't ready then you better go inside
We been waiting for forever for the vendetta to die
'Bout to send the swine to their death, look at tears in the night
Revolution for the future  really help me my nigga
We ain't playing with you we ain't dilly dally my nigga
Fuck 12 they be too sus
Fuck 12 middle school sucks
Fuck yeah most of yall used to ku klux
Oh my fault most of yall still do huh?
Fuck 12 they be too sus
Fuck 12 middle school sucks
Fuck yeah most of yall used to ku klux
Oh my fault most of yall still do huh?

[Outro]
West down on Grove
Just passing 67th Avenue, shots fired, shots fired, multiple shots
