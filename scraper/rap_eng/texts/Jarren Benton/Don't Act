[Hook]
Don’t act like y’all never fuckin’ heard of me
Smilin’ in my face but wanna murder me
Don’t act like we won’t hit these bitches, turn it up!
Leanin’ gasoline, bitch we gonna burn it up!
What you actin’ fo’, what you actin’ fo’?
Keep on fuckin’ with us, give ‘em what they askin’ fo’!
What you actin’ fo’, what you actin’ fo’?
Don’t fuck with us just give us what we askin’ fo’!

[Verse 1]
Straight Tanqueray in my cup, pussy nigga you ain’t like us
Lace it up and then light Up
PBR ‘n Budweiser
Eastside, Quentin Tarantino
Gettin’ head in a old gran torino
Made that pussy pop for a C note
Made that pussy sing like Cee-Lo
Desert Eagle, check a nigga ego
Kickin’ down your door with my amigos
'Bout to throw some D’s on a Regal
Half a gram of coke inside my pea coat
Sayonara, hasta luego
My nigga move blocks like legos
I’m on the same shit they put on Eggos
Waffles, syrup, l'eggo
That’s to all you hatin’ niggas
Them stinkin’ whores they wouldn’t date a nigga
Now they wanna fuck because my paper bigger
Go slit your wrist with a razor, would ya’?
Lights, camera, these niggas actin’
These rappers faggots, I’ma fuckin’ smack ‘em
I’ma fuckin’ spazz, and I’ma fuckin’ stab ‘em
Goin' Charles Manson, I’ma fuckin have ‘em like...

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Sippin’ on Mad Dog 20
I’m goin’ full ‘tard like Timmy (TIMMY!)
I’ma tryna get this ho up out her fendi
Slip a lil of somethin’ in her Remy
The way these niggas actin’ need a Emmy
Smilin’ in your face so friendly
Throw a Molotov into your Bentley
Don’t fuck with Mr. Benton ho, comprende?
Dikembe Mutombo, Alonzo Mourning
Get hit when I wake like hello bitch hi good morning
She don’t care when I call her bitch or a ho
Cause she don’t speak no English, my bitch is a foreign
Your bitch is a boring, my bitch always talk about jerkin’ me off
When I’m home from touring
Really, how? You hadicapped bitch
You Quadriplegic, no legs and no arms
Okay, back to you niggas that’s hatin’
It's Funk Volume bitch, and i ain't got the patience
I came from the bottom, and popped out the basement
I disfigure niggas, let’s play Operation
I cavin’ your face and I need a vacation
Doctor said date ‘em, the Martians invadin’
I stunt on these hoes, Jason Statham
Okay, I’m reloaded, I’m fuckin’ erase ‘em like...
