[Verse 1:]
Yeah, I walk through hell in my Adidas bitch
Inhaling reefer and picking the scabs that life will leave you with
Eastside till my soul decide to leave this bitch
Got snake skin on my shell toes
These kicks will probably make PETA sick
I zone out to the 808
In the old school I let the speakers hit
My Jeremy Scott's got wings on them
I can levitate in these sneakers bitch
This color scheme is so fresh and clean
Pussy nigga you ain't got these
Got the Michael Jackson with the straps on 'em
I can moonwalk Billie Jean (hee)
Sip promethazine in a limousine
Top ten's they winter green
I'll stomp a hater in 3 stripes
And get blood stains on my denim jeans
Lace them up and then scrap in them
Dope boys they trap in them
Jam Master Jay he scratched in them
Run DMC rapped in them (Run!)
B-Boys they pop locked
Tear subways in the South Bronx
Made Hip-Hop in these sneakers
Running through project halls when the cops come
Ghetto kids with dreams
Trying to live life and don't know the outcome
It's history in these sneakers bitch
I had to shout them out on the album
Cause they

[Hook]
Dope boy fresh
Open casket clean
Rick James faded
Smoking gasoline
Eastside till I die
3 stripes on my sneakers
Bitch I'm in my zone
Flexing hard homie
Holdin' my Adidas

[Verse 2]
Rest in peace to the MCA's
A-d-i-d-a-s
I'm so fresh to death, throw me in the crematory
I was on the shit so prematurely
As an adolescent, pubescent teen
Outfit was on guillotine
And my shoe game was open casket clean
I'm a sneaker addict and I need a fix
Polo with these Stan Smiths
West Memphis shit with these high tops
Paid a grip for these damn kicks
It's art on my feet bitch
Like Warhol on a canvas
My girl say I need help
I got a sick fetish for this brand bitch
My homeboy went to jail in them
Next day he made bail in them
Got a pair of 'das so damn cold
With the leopard print and the tail in them
Get pissed off when I scuff them up
I toss them out when I fuck them up
Get a fresh pair the next day
With 4 straps they buckle up
This the brand that I represent
Put that on a testament
This Eastside these 3 stripes
I step out so elegant
Made Hip-Hop in these sneakers
For that I pledge my allegiance
It's me against the world
Middle finger to my foes in my Adidas
