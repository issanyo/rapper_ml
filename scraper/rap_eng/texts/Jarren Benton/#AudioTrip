[Verse 1: Nino Bless]
The government lies
And the hood stay blind
Every south-side in a city is a ghetto
And a dollar's only printed into debt so from the womb you already owe the devil
Wait thats too complicated? Okay, eenie-meenie-miney-mo
Teenie-weenie minds think they're fresh cause they are buying clothes
Polo, oh shit! I ain't mean to go there like when Romo throws a pick
I go solo, like jackin' some homeless folks I am so in a coma, Ebola sick
No, your cancer cells love Coca-Cola soda
Hold up, man shut the fuck up with this bullshit (Sorry, try again)
Versace, Versace, before I couldn't sneak in the cracks were too tiny
But since I've been rhyming so godly they done dilated like an iris on Miley, Cyrus on Mollys
I just embody, Tyson's prime with a karate, black belt
These raps is felt and hit ya chest like having some sake with fish & wassabi at a hibachi
I am captain insomniac, fact, never sleep no
So its by default, Nino's alarm's on beastmode, co-co-copy (whoa)
And in the name of Heaven, I am chasing this wealth
I could escape from the gates of Hell but can not escape from myself
Christ was a carpenter, Nino is a harbinger of the evolved
Got your attention like a swastika stickered yamaka by the bar at a bar mitzvha, fuck ya'll I'm iller
Raw beats through my yamahas stoke this hard spitter, got me all lit up
And this flame got some in awe and probably made Dilla turn to God, like THATS God...Zilla, dog
I am still all that and a bag of the baddest piff mixed with acid hits
Got a bitch so bad she ain't never been on Santa's list, she's only not sucking dick when I have to piss, (I wish)
My wifey won't ever be fond of that rhyme
Thats just a line unless we break up ma√±ana then maybe that line was a sign
(Fuck you Nino!) Just said that so I can do a song with her
2 bisexual girls as roomies, that's word to the ghost of John Ritter
Check the thermometer,somebody temperature's high blame Jarren, I'm hammin
I'm bout to go into his grandma's basement take that gun from her lap and start blammin'
(Blat blat blat blat)

[Verse 2: Jarren Benton]
I'm throwin' Ds on that Delorean
This weed that I'm chiefing on came from Oregon
I need it man so I hop inside the El Camino, then I crash that bitch inside the fucking drug emporium
Fuck you and your metropolis, I'll put the gun in your esophagus
Y'all lames ain't real, these fuck niggas fake acting like they move rocks like a fucking archaeologist
Nigga please, I'm a disease, go get a priest, ain't a fucking human being baby I'm a beast
I'm bout to put a hole in your capris, I told you hoes I'm cheap I'll take a bitch out for a milk shake like Kelis, capicse?
I'm laying on the beach with a bitch, she 'bout to suck the dick til I'm sleep
I wake up, hit the pussy to some Keith Sweat
I'll introduce you rappers to your maker like hello, have you met yet?
I wake with the TEC by the headrest
I'll punch a nigga then I take his necklace
Hoes say that Jarren you a dog, when they throw the pussy at me they be like nigga catch, fetch
Bitch bring it back like the Fresh Fest
I'll put you on the top of that guest list
Mr. Benton coming for you rappers when I catch you motherfuckers I'm-a leave a nigga head-less
God throwing ice to nicest on this mic devices, I'm high trying to fight these vices
Head in the vice grip, I'll leave you lifeless
I ain't got it all someone off my light switch
I eat a rapper's brain and wash it down with Pellegrino, in the Philippines smoking dope with Filipinos
I do a drive-by in an old Grand Tarino, throw a hand grenade out the window with my nigga Nino
