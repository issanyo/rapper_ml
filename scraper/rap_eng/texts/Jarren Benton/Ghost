[Intro]
K-K-Kato on the track, bitch
Black Cloud

[Hook: Locksmith]
Real motherfuckers do real shit (real shit)
Fake motherfuckers get away (get away)
We don't give a fuck how you feel bitch (we don't give a fuck)
We been counting money all day
I been on the grind all year
I been getting mine aw yeah (yeah, yeah)
I been pressing line after line
I been doing quite fine, I ain't worried 'bout them

[Verse 1: Locksmith]
Yeah, how do I make a marker?
How do I break the plain?
How do I fashion out of nothing, enough to finally sustain?
How do I take a notion and focus and not lick the game?
How do I tunnel through the sewage and never show 'em a stain vein?
Pure vanity, candidly I was speaking
Fascinated with fame, my desire started to peak and
I'm taking a route and making a lane that none of you here were seeking
Cause most of these rappers now be reaching
I'm willing to bet the scars and the bruises, they intermediate muses
Sacrifices in crisis, that violently left them clueless
Every slip is a lesson, I'm fully reaping the usage
So what if they sleeping on me, now they lose it
I'm used to the pessimism, I need the discouragement
I encourage it
Every verse is a surgeon, an inclination for nourishment
Every stress is a test and a testament to 'em flourishing
I'm putting my flag down till it's permanent, I concur

[Hook: Locksmith]
Real motherfuckers do real shit (real shit)
Fake motherfuckers get away (get away)
We don't give a fuck how you feel bitch (we don't give a fuck)
We been counting money all day
I been on the grind all year
I been getting mine aw yeah (yeah, yeah)
I been pressing line after line
I been doing quite fine, I ain't worried 'bout them

[Verse 2: Jarren Benton]
Niggas shit on you then turn around and praise you in death
Fuck that fake love, I'd rather take a stake through the chest
Gimme the roses while I'm breathing
Don't wait till I'm a corpse to show remorse
You gotta go through rigor mortis for support
Hate us a pistol, a plastic straw, smack the bitch
Niggas bodies get wrapped with a bag of gauze
Bodies get hat with sauce, these be bitches packed with flaws
So she put them filters on thinking that will attract the boss
Scrubs on the street say he clutching the heat
How she party in Belize but still get government cheese
Moral of the story, half the shit you see is a scam
Niggas do anything for a hit on the gram (clout)
Two turntables and a mic in my hand
Niggas dying from dirty syrup, sprite, and them xans (ugh)
If I don't get rich bitch, I'ma go nuts
When you die that's when your sales go up
What the fuck

[Hook: Locksmith]
Real motherfuckers do real shit (real shit)
Fake motherfuckers get away (get away)
We don't give a fuck how you feel bitch (we don't give a fuck)
We been counting money all day
I been on the grind all year
I been getting mine aw yeah (yeah, yeah)
I been pressing line after line
I been doing quite fine, I ain't worried 'bout them

[Verse 3: Locksmith]
I am the definition of self-sustainable, never would say I'm full
Never would take a hand, I'd bite my tongue to play the fool
I'm making a mark, you're making a mockery portraying cool
You'd rather be unpaid or unrelatable
I'd never accept either
I believe that my circumstances are blessings
Self-examination accumulated aggression
I'm pressing to break the status quo
I'm taking your view, shaking the rules
And making a muse, in my habitation I had to grow
Flow is my ammunition but it ain't just my plan and mission
To feed you misleading lyrics, leave you in panic fishing
But I need you to stand and listen, this is my testimony
Went from being broke to turning down what ain't destined for me
I formally disagree with the office they pitching me
Picture me following suit, tie the suit that they pick for me
Victory is in my foresight
I follow my heart and just ignore hype
This is my declaration for more right

[Bridge: Locksmith]
Real motherfuckers do real shit (real shit)
Fake motherfuckers eat a dick

[Verse 4: Locksmith]
I'm steadily gaining more, more men, and with more venom
Really I'm bored with 'em
Well then I wipe 'em out with metaphors, get 'em
Murder 'em all, reversing the ball, swinging the pendulum, you
Taking advantage of niggas who never knew nothing just to advance few
Get in the game, willing to claim what they can never do
I'm defiant, never compliant, fuck it, I always spit the truth
You been used to these niggas rapping with no condimental traction
And take a potential action to end it in simple fashion
You sick cause you into fast shit
I'm sick cause my lyrics gassin'
Ready to raise the bar, every bar is essential, ask 'em
This is what you ask for, you willing to bleed
I'm willing to crash for, delete for my social media dashboard
You dash toward what you think is your only voice
Niggas will follow anything if you never give 'em a choice

[Hook: Locksmith]
Real motherfuckers do real shit (real shit)
Fake motherfuckers get away (get away)
We don't give a fuck how you feel bitch (we don't give a fuck)
We been counting money all day
I been on the grind all year
I been getting mine aw yeah (yeah, yeah)
I been pressing line after line
I been doing quite fine, I ain't worried 'bout them
