[Intro: Charles Manson]
Maybe i should have killed 4- 5 hundred people, then i would have felt better
Then i would have felt like i really offered the society something
You know, if i wanted to kill somebody
I'd take this book and beat you to death with it, and i wouldn't feel a thing
It would be just like walking to the drugstore

[Verse 1: Jarren Benton]
Yeah, burna by my side i'm Huey Newton in a wicked chair
Wrist frostbit, everywhere i go the bitch is there
Ice cold Benton Ligaments inside the fridge again
Told my mama "Fuck School, 'ima be a billionare"
My heart a ice box fur on my back, that's white fox
Niggas hit the block, put crack inside they white socks
The shit that niggas do to get a buck or two, let a couple loose now they pourin' out a couple brews
Dearly departed, i'm killing these artists
I don't give a fuck about a plaque, they gon' feel me regardless
I needÂ´that dumbbread, i'm so sick i might cut off a fucking nun's head
I'm the future, bitch i have never had my palms red
I might throw gold at the bottom of my teeth
I'm a problem for you geeks
Never modest, i'm a beast
Parallel to hell, blauw niggas catch a pair of shells
Swing the iron at you niggas diddy with the kettlebell

[Hook
One shot, gun shot, three shot, four shot
Am i dead yet?
One time more

One shot, gun shot, three shot, four shot
Leave it dead on the floor

One shot, gun shot, three shot, four shot
Am i dead yet
One time more

One shot, gun shot, three shot, four shot
Leave it dead on the floor

[Verse 2
Drugs, liqour, guns, drugs, liqour, guns
Pull a razor out my gums liqour on my tongue
I sniff gunpowder and i eat metal bullets
Stomp you to death infront of the pigs and sell the footage
Real savage with a still ratchet
Fuck you in the ass with a gun, make you a real faggot
Let's get these pills crackin', let's make these mils' matchin'
Houses and cars under the stars cause we been slackin'
I'm so relaxed knowing how to soak a match
You want me on your tracks then i'm gonna overtax
Snap a fast cause' i use a packets crack
I ain't got no mercy no mo' cause they ain't got my back
Pussy, i'm Drizzy on back to back, Nas on Ether or Biggie on Life after Death
I call on my goons  like "Who we slapping next?"
I have em' blowing in the metal, and no it ain't the clarinet

[Hook
One shot, gun shot, three shot, four shot

One shot, gun shot, three shot, four shot

One time more

One shot, gun shot, three shot, four shot

[Verse 3
Heater by my side, i can feel the cold
Open up the oven, got a sheet of dough
Tell you keep it blunt
If you see the dough, run you mouth until it's time stand to see it, though
Tell you never grow, bitch i see the dough
Humble but i rumble like Muhammed Ali in the jungle, with these demons with George Foreman
I'm George Foreman when the Mike titans like Mike Tyson
Tell my sugar ray [?] is gonna pinch right through the darkness, this is life, fight it
Think outside the box, pack it up like you got lots of it
Fell in love with thots [?] expose like they got cardigans
I was getting carted, hopping trains cause' i have to measure
Drive got me a car, for insurance i got half a Gecko
Racketball been back and forth with paddles on and adderals
Focus on this boat [?]
Cause' there is big fish in the ocean that came from little ponds
[?] Said i feel it never happened, lord it's
