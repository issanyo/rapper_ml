[Intro: Jarren Benton]
Yeah
It's a dedication bitches
Outkast
Jarren Benton
Jawz Of Life
My nigga Stanza
Let's go
Niggas get jacked like Daniel
Something I can handle
Come on
I told you that bitch ain't dead nigga

[Verse 1: Jarren Benton]
Listen
This is my story, this is my song
And to the pussy niggas don't attempt to try this at home
My brain's gone
Mama I ain't coming home
See I done fucked around and slipped into the unknown
I get the weirdest feeling that we are not alone
I think they listen to us when we on the telephone
I'm up late night like I'm on a telethon
Performing open heart surgeries on microphones
Death to the negative niggas and [?]
Who say that they don't understand the shit that I be on
That you don't understand God, life's hard
I try to touch a nigga's soul through his iPod
Then I jog
Through opticals
I done seen shit through my opticals
Nigga pain was an option though
But yet sky's still the limit
I am Jarren Benton, not a motherfucking gimmick
Never been shot
Never slung rocks
Try to give the people hope through the form of hip hop
Rip my heart out my chest and put it on the pad
And give it to the world motherfucker that's swag

[Hook]
Do you know what bring rats, mice, snakes up out they hole
Chonkyfire, spliced with rock n'roll indubitably, piper pied
Now hold on my brother no, no, no, no, hip hop's alive

[Verse 2: Jawz Of Life]
And doing quite well
If it died it done reincarnated through JOL
Hell
I've been on my feet I mean I've been in my shells
Before flip phone sales
Before toothpaste was gel
Before [?] mall had a store called Zales
Before you told your sister "I'm-a tell"
My throat provided hope
To the blind man I'm the braille
To the deaf I'm the hearing
Aid for the listenin'
We've been on a mission
Since Jesus went fishin' with Peter
Kicking peppers cut 'em up with egg after Easter
On the tater salad watch me [?] want it but she got me instead
A real King like Don
Or Juan
With dream
Regime
With dungeon but still my team

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Stanza]
When I'm diving off the highest diving board, no splash
In the square I circle you Urkels, I whoop your ass
The blackjack Johnson
Tyson with the tattoo
I make you bitches suck my johnson
This is the interview
Now there are ten of you on top
Your rhymes compared to mine
Are tennis shoes and I'm flyin'
The blocks you say are old are the ones I call home
So you're lyin'
I'm a lion
And you're fucking with my pride
Now it's on your popcorn nigga
The same song I couldn't manage [?]
Now my arm strong
Go Goliath and David at the same time
The only guy stopping me is me
I put the slingshot down
Samson with no hair
Been lying to niggas don't go there
I bible niggas just to show no care
This is the new basic
I am Stanza
You should hate me

[Hook]

[Outro: Jarren Benton]
I feel like
All these close minded ass niggas in my own city
Won't even let your boys in the game right now
It's a whole different part of the south that got some shit to say
You know what I'm saying
No disrespect to the rest of y'all niggas
But we ain't just snapping in traffic
We got some real motherfucking shit to say
But we can't be stopped
You know what I'm saying
That's all I got to say
