[Intro]
Money Bag, Money Bag, Money Bag

[Verse 1]
Might rock leather in the summer
Watch for the P's and piranhas
Chopper put  a nigga in a coma
Paramedics right around the corner
Momma like the smell of marijuana
But she don't wanna see a nigga high
Prayin' for a nigga every hour
Cause she afraid to see a nigga die
Raised on the mothafuckin eastside
Throwed off nigga i don't seem right
My niggas on go they got the green light
Ay level up nigga get ya team right
I'm paranoid so i keep the ox on me
Fur coat, baby white fox on me
Neighbors wanna call the fuckin' cops on me
Cause i pulled up in the bitch in the drive homie
Ill nigga, ill nigga, ill nigga
Hell yeah, that's the way i feel nigga
Full time job, bout to kill niggas
If it ain't bout the bag, i don't deal witcha
'95 Pac and versace
Bitches pussy poppin' in the lobby
Feel good when you puttin' food on the table, try to stop me i'mma prolly catch a body, it's a homicide-

[Chorus]
Money Bag, Money Bag, Money Bag
Hell yeah, Tony Montana bag
Bitch selling pussy made a hunnid racks
Stick go stand in front of that
Bust down, Bust down, Bust down
Just copped a Rollie that's a bust down
Chopper go not to bust down
If she ain't suckin' dick she on the bus now
Money Bag, Money Bag, Money Bag
Hell yeah, Tony Montana bag
Bitch selling pussy made a hunnid racks
Stick go stand in front of that
Bust down, Bust down, Bust down
Just copped a Rollie that's a bust down
Chopper go not to bust down
If she ain't suckin' dick she on the bus now

[Post-Chorus]
Money Bag, Money Bag, Money Bag
Hell yeah, Tony Montana bag
Bitch selling pussy made a hunnid racks
Stick go stand in front of that
Bust down, Bust down, Bust down
Flexin' on the bitch please calm down
Bandcamp drum, hold a hunnid rounds
Mask off, lay a nigga on the ground

[Verse 2]
'96 Master P, gold tank
Greedy nigga, yeah i want the whole bank
Get a bitch, dick'll make the hoe faint
If you a dope boy, cop the whole thang
Might hit the beach in a mink
Killa Cam nigga, all pink
Raekwon cuban gold links
12 wanna throw us in the clink
If you a fuck nigga, i don't fuck witchu
I don't wanna share space or raise a cup witchu
If i ain't got the aux i gotta cut niggas
Real lowkey, you can catch me in the cut nigga
'95 Pac and Versace
Blow a couple grand up at follies
Feel good when you bringin' money to the table try to stop me i'mma prolly catch a body, it's a homicide-

[Chorus]
Money Bag, Money Bag, Money Bag
Hell yeah, Tony Montana bag
Bitch selling pussy made a hunnid racks
Stick go stand in front of that
Bust down, Bust down, Bust down
Just copped a Rollie that's a bust down
Chopper go not to bust down
If she ain't suckin' dick she on the bus now
Money Bag, Money Bag, Money Bag
Hell yeah, Tony Montana bag
Bitch selling pussy made a hunnid racks
Stick go stand in front of that
Bust down, Bust down, Bust down
Just copped a Rollie that's a bust down
Chopper go not to bust down
If she ain't suckin' dick she on the bus now

Money Bag, Money Bag, Money Bag
