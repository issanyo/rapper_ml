[Verse 1: Jarren Benton]
Uh
Greedy nigga, I want all the guap
Got rid of some niggas, now I call the shots
Benton season, I watch all you drop
No justice for my people, it's fuck all you cops
We was making plays back at Dame's house
Meanwhile them boys was blowing niggas brains out
Where the fuck was Kendall with the Pepsi?
These rappers turn to Jews these niggas looking sketchy
I just want peace and a billion bucks
Get my dick sucked by resilient sluts
Pray my son and daughter have a happy life
Designer clothes and good dick made her a happy wife
My favorite Yeezy album: Late Registration
Vintage polo jackets in my mama's basement
My nigga Ned was chopping crack
We would listen to Company Flow and run it back
I used to sound like Big and Dre
Mixed with Em and Luniz [?]
Real heavy into Wu shit
Rest in peace, Dirty, this that Brooklyn Zoo shit
Damn I miss my nigga Slow
Motherfuck the world, I'm here to let these niggas know

[Hook]
It gets lonely sometimes
When you travel down that road
'Cause everybody can't go
Even in darkness I shine
Blowing smoke, moving through time
Is the vacancy on the passenger side of my journey?

[Verse 2: Jarren Benton]
Uh
Goddamn I miss my old friends
Open the back door and let them hoes in
My mama used to work a lot
My nigga's mama broke so he would serve the block
Southern nigga bumping Illmatic
That dungeon family era that was real magic
We used to cut school and hit the Lenox Mall
Smoking dope at 5 points and bumping Biggie Smalls
That's when I met my baby mama
We could hit the [?] but had a crazy summer
Medusa Offspring that was the rap group
Reebok classics, not a contract suit
That's when I got my first tattoo
Fell in love with this bitch that gave me the claps, ooh
I was in love with Hip-Hop
We used to try to sneak in the club, and they told us kick rocks
Some of my niggas turned to crack addicts
Some did time in the Feds and now they back at it
Some living in the sky
I cherish every moment
Every minute that went by
Too much to rap about I reminisce when I get high
Time turns to memories
Can't take them with you when you die

[Hook x2]
It gets lonely sometimes
When you travel down that road
'Cause everybody can't go
Even in darkness I shine
Blowing smoke, moving through time
Is the vacancy on the passenger side of my journey?
