[Verse 1: Jarren Benton]
Yea, I’m throwin D’s on the Cadillac
Riding through Decatur nigga, bumping Burt Bacharach
You a fuckin’ liar faggot, never slung a crumb of crack
Bash your fuckin window in
I drag you out your pontiac
Tell your mom the zombie’s back
Fucking hypochondriac
Gag a bitch and shove her in the dryer at the laundry mat
Cokehead insomniac, sipping on some Cognac
Dude this fuckin album sucks I want my fuckin money back
Disadvantage, I’m schizophrenic, these bitches panic
Dickin Janice, I’m poppin Xanax and speaking Spanish
Na la cum la la cum pla, I ain’t say a word
A fuckin’ nerd, I’m riding dirty with the Mossberg
I am awkward, I’m sippin cough syrup
I’m high as a martian in a flying saucer
What up to 808 Blake and Mike Whalberg
I punch through the sheet rock and make the wall hurt
'Teen Wolf', I claw a dress and panties off her
Just got a new Lebaron and the seats is all fur
My brains fried, heart’s gone and my balls hurt
I grab the nine to forty-five and let ‘em all squirt
Mr. Benton, bitches said they sick of him
I’m up at Micky Ds, I get an English McMuffin
You hang around all pigs like you McLovin
I shove a freakin prick inside a fuckin brick oven
You niggas fake like mall cop, Paul Blart
I run you over with the shopping cart in Wal- Mart
Hop out the Subaru, huffing a tube of glue
Your girl ring around my dick just like a hula hoop
Maneuver through the city in a bullet proof suit
I’m strong enough to rip a fucking roof up off a coup
You wanna play 2Pac
I throw you off the roof and run down and catch you
Tell these niggas "Jarren got the juice"
Somebody call the doctor, Dr. Suess or Dr. Ruth
I’m so out of my fucking rocker any fucking doc'll do
I let the choppers loose and then I smoke a rock or two
And spend a hundred grand on a one-legged prostitute

[Hook: Jarren Benton]
Yea I’m going hard nigga, honey baked
Big say more money, more niggas hate
I blow a couple racks, just took an eighth of coke
Now let me show you what it means to be skitzo

[Verse 2: Jarren Benton]
Doctor Conrad Murray, Bitch I’m known to kill mics
And meet you in your nightmares, and bash you with a steel pipe
Somebody must have laced this heroin cause I don’t feel right
Just bought my wife a set of Martha Stewart stainless steal knives
Hey, I’m fuckin talking to you dickhead!
Jarren, he's dead he cannot hear you, idiot
Roaming every cities strips and grabbing every pretty tits
Yall niggas playing hookie, mister Benton's really sick
Leave it to Beaver I’m leaving with Beiber with this meat cleaver to his neck
And I’m making him eat ether, kick a bitch in the face cause she’s a dick teaser
Did a song with Satan and that’s a sick feature
I’m not a human being, I’m a sick creature
Run in every church to murder every sick preacher
Stompin niggas to a seizure , smoking every spliff of reefer
A bully throwing geeks off the top bleacher
Fucking skitzo eat the barrel of pistols
I can shit a hand grenade and piss out a missile
Let’s play Operation, I want to see blood drizzle
Let’s make it real official, this saw will cut through a gristle
I’m so extraordinary sleep inside the mortuary
Wake inside the cemetary, dig up every corpse that’s buried
This is so unnecessary, voices in my head, they’re scary
Sick of being crazy, God I want to be ordinary!

[Hook: Jarren Benton]
Yea I’m going hard nigga, honey baked
Big said more money, more niggas hate
I blow a couple racks, just took an eighth of coke
Now let me show you what it means to be a schitzo

[Bridge: Jarren Benton]
Yo Jarren, Jarren wake up dog
Come on, yo wake the fuck up man, come on
Come on, Yo Kato, Kato call 911
Man I think this fucker overdosed

[Outro: Kato]
Yo Jarren, Jarren
Stop, stop, stop! Chill
Yo, you're just slapping...
You're talking to yourself right now man
I'm trynna study for this midterm...
Fucking Skitzo...
