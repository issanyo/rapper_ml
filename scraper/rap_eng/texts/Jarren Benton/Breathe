[Verse 1: Adamite]
Ugh yea round and round I go like the fucking merry go
So quick I turn the Holy Ghost into holy smoke, Holy Smokes!
Look at that nose on Pinocchio, my dick got the same curse thats why I lie until I blow!
Whoah! Speaking of blowing yes I'm blowing smoke, like a train or locomotive, welcome to the magic show
I'm not a dummy, yes I'm eating with a full tummy, thanking Mickie D associates like thanks Honey, Hahaha Yea
Thanks for the money, drive away in the getaway car while the bass bumping, We cracking up like Humpty Dumpty
But wheres the wall, lights flashing like who & the fuck done went and called the law
Poppin' smarties & Adderall in the backseat, the cop says your under arrest I say who me?
He says yes sir your under the influence, I pulled my hand back slap him like bitch you been stupid

[Hook: Adamite]
Now sit back, relax, & inhale-exhale just breathe
Sit back, relax, & inhale-exhale just breathe
Sit back, relax, & inhale-exhale just breathe
Sit back, relax, & inhale-exhale just breathe

[Verse 2: Jarren Benton]
JARREN BENTON, I chug a pass through and slap you
Doing doughnuts in the parking lot, I hit the median spun out & broke the axel
Deranged lunatic, I walk the block in a speedo, Anchorman 2, I smack you with a bean burrito
Throw a rock up at the sky and accidentally hit an alien, chilling with Australians
Get head from an Israelian, whore I take it out her ass & skeeted on her cranium
I spazz like a Tasmanian, my dick is like titanium, Yea, I bully rappers like Debo
Catch me in the isle at your local Home Depot, stick to the G-Code, shoot at your peep-hole
Gotta big ego, I don't like sharing needles but I will if I have to, Niggas know that cash rules
I got my GED by crashing parties at your Grad-School, mad screws loose inside of my head
I woke up with a dead whore inside of my bed

[Hook: Adamite]
Now sit back, relax, & inhale-exhale just breathe
Sit back, relax, & inhale-exhale just breathe
Sit back, relax, & inhale-exhale just breathe
Sit back, relax, & inhale-exhale just breathe

[Verse 3: Adamite]
Jarren! I thought we learned not to fuck whores
Now your laying next to her lifeless & dead corpse
The cops will think the intercourse was more than likely forced
Aww fuck it she opens her legs up more than a door
I panic & run around in a fucking circle
Drop my glasses, jinkies, I'm the white version of Steve Urkel
I can barely move & yea I got an attitude, I just need a bowl of Campbell's Chicken Noodle Soup
Glaucoma, mixed with a strange aroma, appeal to the senses, about as appealing as a coma
I'll tear through you like a zombie on some bath salts, don't blame Adamite or Jarren I swear it's not our faults!
No, its not our fault, it's not our fault, it's not our fault, I swear to you it's not our fault!

[Hook: Adamite]
Now sit back, relax, & inhale-exhale just breathe
Sit back, relax, & inhale-exhale just breathe
Sit back, relax, & inhale-exhale just breathe
Sit back, relax, & inhale-exhale just breathe
