[Intro]
(Sighs) You're a monster

[Chorus: Oba Rowland]
Ain't no hoes in my clique, I got hoes on my dick
Round this bitch I'm Godzilla
R-round this bitch I'm Godzilla
I got bands in my denim, she got friends why not hit em'
I'm a fuckin' live nigga and I'ma fuckin' die winnin'
Bitch (x31)

[Verse 1: Jarren Benton]
Uh, slam Cadillac doors diamond glow on these hoes
New fur on my back sweep the floor on these hoes
That top was A1 had to Vogue on that hoe
Hit the bitch from the back strike a pose in her throat
I'm like uhh. I'm fresh out the dirt bitch I might go berzerk
I kill everything Kato find 'em a hearse
My mind doesn't work someone find him in church
Chrome to your dreads bitch I'm gone off the meds
Got hitters to cut off the bone from your flesh
I saut√© a nigga I'm known as the chef
Got a white bitch that look like Selena Gomez
Ooo, I might go Bieber on niggas
Aluminum bat Derek Jeter on niggas
Too much Tequila I bleed from the liver
Exterminator got the heat for the critters
Ain't making money with him, fuck 'em
Hard to trust these bitches I would never cuff em'
I was out there bussin', niggas clutching ovens
Coldest from the bottom, that is no discussion
Fuck the repercussions, sleep the reapers cousin
I'm my brothers keeper, I'ma keep the covenet
Side bitch foreign, bitch is speakin' Russian
Going Godzilla we can't even function nigga

[Chorus: Oba Rowland]
Ain't no hoes in my clique, I got hoes on my dick
Round this bitch I'm Godzilla
R-round this bitch I'm Godzilla
I got bands in my denim, she got friends why not hit em'
I'm a fuckin' live nigga and I'ma fuckin' die winnin'
Bitch (x31)

[Verse 2: B.o.B]
Godammit who them niggas makin' all the racket in the back
Bitch you see I'm tryna teach a class
Talk about a graduation cap
Never say some shit and take it back in these raps no ain't no exaggeration ain't no cap
Niggas think they runnin' shit, must be to my runnin' shit like (huff huff)
Give a dime a dummer dick now I got my thumb this bitch face
All of the time, bitches be lyin'
She don't own no clothin' line she just do lines
Mental apocalypse, you got a job and shit I do the opposite
Niggas be poppin' shit, I turn into Pac and shit
Hold up
Fuck are you talkin' to? You'll be dead at your eulogy
There's your walk that you bark if you
What up? Pay the blunts, straight
Yo shit is moderate, I'm a post modernist
I do the bodyin', they do the copyin'
Niggas ain't smokin' what I smoke, it's obvious
Niggas be actin' like bitches, androgynous
Eight albums in and they fucked the Kardashian
How she keep goin' and don't need no Oxygen?
Round this bitch she throw zilla

[Chorus: Oba Rowland]
Ain't no hoes in my clique, I got hoes on my dick
Round this bitch I'm Godzilla
R-round this bitch I'm Godzilla
I got bands in my denim, she got friends why not him em'
I'm a fuckin' live nigga and I'ma fuckin' die winnin'
Bitch (x46)
