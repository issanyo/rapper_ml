[Verse 1: Mike Bars]
Yeah, I'm up to no good
Nerdy looking white boy
I’m the kid that you beat up on the black top
Think that you can talk smack on my YouTube
’Til I come and climb out your lap top
Yeah, little internet bully
He want the part, but he ain't committed yet fully
He think he the shit ‘cause he stick to the script
But the twist is, Imma put a clip in that bully
Uh, ain’t it funny how the roles switch?
Now that I'm getting money you're a broke bitch
Thought that you could pull my card
Then you're gonna have to Go Fish
Shit ain’t the same as in ‘06
See you can swing, but I won’t flinch
You’ll get your throat slit
You can’t hang like the rope slipped
Been a bad boy since the flow switched

[Hook: Mike Bars]
Yeah, I’m up to no good (x3)
Flipped my whole style, I’ve been dope since
Dirty, rotten, foul, foul
Yeah I’m up to no good (x3)
Dirty, rotten, foul, foul
Ask the god down in Zone 6
Yeah I’m up to no good

[Verse 2: Jarren Benton]
Yeah, pussy nigga, the bully’s back
Mack 10, Mack 11 and that bitch fully strapped
Yeah, my mama missed me with that Plan B
A nuisance to the block, the fucking neighbors couldn’t stand me
Drugs in a cereal box in back of the pantry
Sock full of Duracells, pow, I knock out your man’s teeth
I’m a narcissist, bullets pop out the cartridges
Tear through your cartilage, turn you niggas to carcasses
These rappers turn to bitches, wearing women’s clothes
Murder opponents, dig a ditch and put you in the hole
These niggas is squarer than fucking Rubix Cubes
Told your bitch to send me a few good nudes
I snorkle in that pussy wearing scuba shoes
You’re aiming at the stars and the sky when you let the Ruger shoot
Keep talking, I’ll be up in your hood
With a pack of angry niggas that be up to no good, bitch

[Hook: Mike Bars]
Yeah, I’m up to no good (x3)
Dirty, rotten, foul, foul
Yeah I’m up to no good (x3)
Dirty, rotten, foul, foul
Yeah I’m up to no good

[Verse 3: Mike Bars]
You fucked up when you fell asleep
See I'm the dude that you find in your nightmare
Strap in, remember what happened on Elm Street?
Deadly - who you think gave Freddy the idea?
Yeah, I guess I’m a freak
That must be why on Halloween Michael Myers go and dress up as me
I heard your music, dog - it should be on Sesame Street
I don’t feel it... like the Ecstasy in my drink
Y’all just chick flicks, no action
You talk, but don't say shit, closed caption
Guess I'm old fashioned, I won’t smack up a hoe
But I’ll whip these boys into shape, I’m Joe Jackson
In High School, y’all was tryna' be slick
Now every one of y’all is my riding my dick
So the nerd in me got urges to murder you hoes verbally
And give you all a third degree burn from the fire I spit
God I’m a pain, but I’m hotter than flame
I ought to be rottin' in Hell like I’m Sadam Hussein
Get out of my brain - swerve, bitch, you’re not in my lane
This Treehouse Gang, hoe, my whole squad is insane
So if you see me, don’t act brave
This ain’t PG, it’s Pee Wee in a matinee
So um, just beat it
And watch your lip, or it might get split like FV did
Break ups happen, my ex had a rare obsession
She said “I love you boo, but there’s something I’m scared to mention
When we’re kissing, sometimes I pretend that you’re Jarren Benton”
So I grabbed her, and dragged her out by her hair extensions
She was a heart breaker...up until Bars ate her
But first I chained her up and I made her do hard labor
Next I’m gonna carve up her ex with a sharp razor
And leave him on a breathing machine like Darth Vader
Okay, that’s a bit much
I’m actually a nice guy
But I’ll say anything for a quick buck
See, all my shit sucks
I only rap just to laugh at how mad people get
I’m a sick fuck
I don’t even like blood, I’m a boss
Y’all more hung up on that than Christ was on that cross
But on some real shit, if y’all don't stop with them Twitter memes
I’ll hit the kill switch and blow you all up to smithereens
Just when the shit seems peaceful
I’ll shoot you with two cannons
'Cause all of my clips need sequels
Fuck boy, If you diss me I’ll turn the tables
Like a bus boy with a party of 16 People
Yeah I’m raw with this and sicker than Saw victims
When I'm spittin’, the whole beat stops and the song listens
An armed menace with bars who’s dealing in large shipments
Mike Bars merch and I ship it from long distance
Dog and my squad’s vicious, no topic is off limits
If Nas spit this, y’all wouldn’t be calling him God’s witness
My song lyrics are all gimmics, but I’m bored of gore
Fuck horror core, I just do this for the goth bitches
