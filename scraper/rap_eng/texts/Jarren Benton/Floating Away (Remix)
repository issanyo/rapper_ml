[Verse 1: Wrekonize]
I fill my tea cup with a bunch of stems and watch them heat up
This whole work week sucked, I really need to ease up
And what better way than to travel in time
Through the map and chew the fat all from the back of my mind
Sometimes it's business, but most the time it's purely pleasure
Seeing things that gets ya double checking what your next to
Try to keep the dosage underneath the limit, Dexter
Or otherwise I'm leaving off the couch out on a stretcher
Trying not to freak out, wallpaper walking
Alien on the TV set, all apes are talking
Stomach kind of nauseous, can't fix with Pepto
Everything is turning Easter colors, time to get low
Brain's gone AWOL, I think I've lost my mind
Technicolor paintball, I'm firing down the line
It's hard to know what's going on when time's hard to find
My tea'll make you see what normally you never mind
And it's been a while since I took a stroll down to memory lane
I finish up my cup and stand up to see what's changed
Seems pretty familiar in this land of milk and honey
No sanity required when you in the space above me and

[Hook: Wrekonize]
Everything's floating away
Nothing's like I found it
Everything's floating away
I can't stay grounded
Everything's floating away
Nothing's like I found it
Everything's floating away
Floating away, I'm floating away

[Bridge: Wrekonize (Bernz)]
(Float, float, float) Get high
(Float, float, float) Get high
(Float, float, float) Get high
(Come on)

[Verse 2: R.A. the Rugged Man]
Hoping you heard of me holding the hammers
You less of a threat than the pope in pajamas
You softer than Barry Manilow singing Copacabanas
Armed robbery robbing you properly
I'm on your property, hypocrisy, murder rappin' debauchery
Before New York cleaned up the four deuce
I had more hair on my chest than Chuck Norris in the flick that he fought Bruce
They hating, it ain't working, it's lyrical brain surgeon
I'm out of the cage lurking you, saying my name's squirming you
Stay in your lane swerving, I'm out of the cave, German
Angulo vs. James Kirkland, I'm hungry, insane, thirsting
Let's go oh so slow, let me flow
Your brain's blown from the fast flow, take a dick choke
300 pound women, I'm eating some hawk ass
In Japan I'm eating the pussy wearing the Saw's mask
Once my army of sperm start swimming in sour women
In the mansion with Wong from Hong Kong, Dom sipping, float

[Verse 3: Jarren Benton]
Strap me in a strait-jacket and move me in a clinic
I'm tweaking again, I'm seeing things of hallucinogenics
The room just keeps spinning, my mind just keeps bending
My spine just keep trembling, what the fuck got into him?
A little bit of shroom, get a minimum
I'm eating the stems and it moves my adrenaline
Fuck it, you popped one and I had like ten of them
Come on this medical journey with me
Take a walk on my whiff and float away like I'm helium
I can't feel my face, shit
So I walk around the town like a zombie on fucking Bankhead
My girl get the shroom and get freaky and give me great head
These colors look so vibrant, fuck it, I'll paint my face red
Mama get custody of the kids like K.Fed
Cause I'm a rocket-man floating in space and I'm brain-dead
Big in the spirit, what you hear is belligerent gibberish
I break down architectural blueprints of pyramids
I am high as hell, tell the medics to come and haul him in
Everything's floating and Jarren's talking to walls again
