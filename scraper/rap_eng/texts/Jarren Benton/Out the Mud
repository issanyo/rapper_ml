[Intro: Jarren Benton]
K-K-Kato on the track, bitch

[Verse: 1]
Yeah, east side nigga, old Atlanta
Mix that cocaina with the arm and hammer
Nab his bag, they wear them blue bandanas
Niggas still at this, they just shoot his hands up, uuh
Came out the mud, used to live there
Chopper dead it drop a big bear
Won't put my dick in a bitch bare (uh-uh)
Wrestle my demons like Ric Flair, uuh
Please miss me with the horse shit
The horse power in the Porshe sick
I murder everything that's the course bitch
Mazel tov, pop the cork, bitch
King Benton I'm the lord's gift
Big scale on the forklift
I read the Forbes list while eatin swordfish, uh
Yeah, trap panther fuckin lap dancers
Drop out, I was baggin' grams up
Damn I thank, was back in hand cuffs
Fast forward now we stackin bands up
Niggas pussy, we gon' smack your mans up
Thirty rounds in the black banana
Fuck the monkey shit this is black Atlanta, ugh

[Chorus]
I got it outta the mud (out the mud)
I got it outta the mud (out the dirt)
I'm comin' up from the bottom (from the bottom)
I got it outta the mud (Brrah)
Uh
Came out the dirt with a whole lot of thugs (with a whole lot of thugs)
Only one option: to win (haa)
I got it outta the mud
I got it outta the mud (out the mud)
I got it outta the mud (out the dirt)
I'm comin' up from the bottom (from the bottom)
I got it outta the mud (Brrah)
Uh
Came out the dirt with a whole lot of thugs (with a whole lot of thugs)
Only one option: to win (haa)

[Verse: 2]
New money new phone I'm like who dis (brr)
Peace on me bitch I'm a Buddhist (I'm a Buddhist)
My bitch couldn't care with no clothes on (she naked)
She walk in my crib like a nudist (uuh)
Me and Kato on some new shit (new shit)
Don't get it twisted like a Rubix (cube)
Run up on me like ya stupid I ain't talking music nigga I will lose it (Brrrah hah)
Fuck you if you think that I am that nigga (I am that nigga)
Not in a literal sense but god dammit I can't think of nobody sicker
I just went through a divorce (freedom)
Got outta tune with the lord (god)
Lately I've been on the edge (oj)
I will put you in the morgue (room)
Okay if you look at scores (swish)
I put a few on the board (cool)
I had to flex on these niggas
See the snakes from the view on the porch
My ego I'm Dylon Dylon (dylon)
Born alone bitch I'ma die alone (die alone)
The drugs that I'm on got me paranoid
Say my prayers every night with a firearm

[Chorus]
I got it outta the mud (out the mud)
I got it outta the mud (out the dirt)
I'm comin' up from the bottom (from the bottom)
I got it outta the mud (Brrah)
Uh
Came out the dirt with a whole lot of thugs (with a whole lot of thugs)
Only one option: to win (haa)
I got it outta the mud
I got it outta the mud (out the mud)
I got it outta the mud (out the dirt)
I'm comin' up from the bottom (from the bottom)
I got it outta the mud (Brrah)
Uh
Came out the dirt with a whole lot of thugs (with a whole lot of thugs)
Only one option: to win (haa)
