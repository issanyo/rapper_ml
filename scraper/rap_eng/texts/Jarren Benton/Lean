[Hook]
You put the codeine in the Sprite
And then you mix it all up
Then you sip it slow
That's how them killas get fucked up
We call that lean, lean
We call that lean, lean
You put the codeine in the Sprite
And then you mix it all up
Then you sip it slow
That's how them killas get fucked up
We call that lean, lean
We call that lean, lean

[Verse 1]
Bada-boom, bada-bing
White cup of lean
Blunt full of green
In the cut as I lean
In a Cutlass Supreme
Fuck with the team
Got her tucked in a jean
I'mma show you what I mean
When I cut a nigga clean, scalpel please
Throw a mu'fucka off the balcony
She don't wanna (gulp) when she give a nigga head
Cause she said that she's tryna watch her calories
It's the weekend
Let your hair down, swallow semen
She just wanna be my girlfriend
Bitch, wake up ho, are you dreamin'?
I got wife and I got children
I don't need you catchin' feelings
What the fuck these bitches sniffing
Cuz you trippin', listen...

Philippine, Billie-Jean, guillotine,Ritalin
Drizzling, Jiggling, Ringaling, Niggaling
Chainsaw blade goes ring-ring
Get a motherfucker for the bling-bling
Bitch I'm on the lean-lean
Girl you on the same thing
Wayne ain't on it no more, let it go, I'mma bring-bring
Chain Flame, get a beat, it's a drink
Gone off of mufuckin' Sprite and Promethazine

[Hook]
You put the codeine in the Sprite
And then you mix it all up
Then you sip it slow
That's how them killas get fucked up
We call that lean, lean
We call that lean, lean
You put the codeine in the Sprite
And then you mix it all up
Then you sip it slow
That's how them killas get fucked up
We call that lean, lean
We call that lean, lean

[Verse 2]
Lean, on it
'Half Ounce, Quarter Pound', throw it in the bong
Nigga we, on it
You ain't gotta fuck it, you ain't even gotta suck it
Just pull out my dick bitch, breathe on it
I often drift, where was I?
Lean in my cup and I'm feelin' so high
"Dude get the keys to his automobile
And if he can't walk straight then you know he can't drive!"
Lean it, swerve it, please don't let a nigga crash
Shoulda got a cab
Shoulda, coulda, woulda, never woulda been a coulda shoulda
Rip a nigga ass
Throw up in a bag
Eastside, throw it on a map
Cut open a blunt, then I fill it up with hash
If I get the pussy, I'mma put it in a hat
I'mma pull it out her mouth, then I put it in her ass like...

Cocaine, lo mein, propane, Rogaine
Gold chain, no brain, Cobain, Don't mayne
Profane, no shame, slow vein, no vain
No lames, squares and no names
No limit, hit 'em with a tec and a gold tank
Y'all niggas hate cause I'm doin' my own thing
ATLien, finding my own lane
Pop cup full of soda pop and codeine

[Hook]
You put the codeine in the Sprite
And then you mix it all up
Then you sip it slow
That's how them killas get fucked up
We call that lean, lean
We call that lean, lean
You put the codeine in the Sprite
And then you mix it all up
Then you sip it slow
That's how them killas get fucked up
We call that lean, lean
We call that lean, lean
