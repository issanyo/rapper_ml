[Hook]x2
Now I'm a S-O-U-T-H-E-R-N man
Hot damn, I'm hot
They can't break me, shake me, throw me
I thought I told you that I can't stop

[Verse 1]
Now I'm a southern man greater baby
East side Decatur baby
Stone Mountain drop out
Mama pray that the Lord'll save me
Daddy was a deadbeat, mama now strugglin'
Grandmama helped out, there was no husband
Collard greens, neck bones, bread in the oven
Grams on the son, no brother, two cousins
One drunk uncle, one gay, but I love him
One was a family man, I ain't see much of him
Six aunties, they was like a nigga's mom
Atlanta public schools made the kid seem dumb
Where the role models at? I don't see none
No father figure, how can I be one
I'm trying to give Gia the life that I never had
I ain't gon' lie, some days I be scared
Waking up in cold sweats, all a nigga got is rap
As long as God got me, baby, they can't hold me back

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Now I'm a southern man, chitlins
Right along on the sandwiches
Pa, ma, chicken
That shit will damage us
Cadillacs, gold real, smile for the camera
Country ass dialect, some folks laugh at us
Cash put the A on the map
90 percent of the rappers in the A nowadays sound wack
Same old bullshit when he raps
If a nigga ain't dancing  with his snap he probably up for the trap
Y'all lames don't respect the god
If Jarren ain't the sickest in the south then that's a facade
Haha, holler back
The south got the best barbecue
I'm vegetarian and what comes after that

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Now I'm a southern man
Stack of Benjamins in a rubber band
Born in the south
Kidnapped from the motherland
Dope boys slinging rocks, he want something other than...
Minimum wage, a lifetime of sufferin'
We show 'em southern hospitality
Any disrespect, we show 'em southern fatal casualties
That's the way it has to be
Young entrepreneurs we slung CD's in the car trunk like Master P
They say them southern boys slow
Trying to play us like a ho
We gon' let you niggas know (let 'em know)
Jarren give his heart to get this blow
I swear to God we gon' make it here
I'm sick of living poor
1 million of us on the pole
We done came a long way but still got far to go
And we have never fled
See, we didn't run up north, we done stayed down here
Bitch, we ain't never scared

[Hook]
