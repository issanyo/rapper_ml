[Intro]
Jarren Benton! SMKA
Nigga wassup
I’m lost in a world made of 808

[Verse 1]
808, beat up blocks
Jarren Benton, he don’t stop
SMKA, we gon’ rock
Speakers blown on my speaker box
Wood grain, Chevy day
Superman was Lois Lane
Night of the Living Dead, we want brain
Blow on a O, on that Mary Jane
Trunk trunk, raddle it, let it bang
Nostrils full of that Eddie Kane
Me I’m tryna get faded, man
If is that fire, nigga let it flame
She like that, it won’t you let it rain
Always money, ho you insane
Trigger on that bitch, know who that lane
Don’t stop, get it, get it, do that thing
Cadillac grown, Cadillac gone
Click-click blah, handle that chrome
Heavy metal that will put a crack on that dome
Sucka ass nigga better paddle back home
TPG, Eastside zone
Fuck up the booth when I beast those songs
Kickin’ down the fuckin’ door to get a little bit of dough
Then hop in that coupe nigga, peace I’m gone

[Hook (2X)]
808 bumpin’, the speakers are jumpin’
The bass just tumpin’
The beat keeps pumpin’
And we got it, we got, we got it, we got it

[Verse 2]
She wanna fuck with that nigga cause think that I got-got-got
When I pull up in the Oldschool Six Deuce
Leanin’ low, beatin’ down your block-block-block
Feeling so screwed then chop-chop-chop
Girl get low then drop-drop-drop
Fuck around with SMKA and J you will get shot-shot-shot
Get it? Yeah!
Cash rules everything nigga, Wu-Tang
Batmobile nigga, black Bruce Wayne
UFO with the triple gold D’s and the 20’s in the back kick Liu Kang
Suicide doors, Kurt Cobain
Fresh to the graveyard 6 shoot game
Hit the pussy, beat the pussy, fuck from the back all night
And I don’t even know her name
Why they hate on that 808 that thing that go
I’m here to take over and innovate so wanna lock doors, it ain’t safe
GA red clay, dope on wax
Fiends get hooked then they can’t go back
Feel it in your soul, this that crack
Put it in your pipe nigga, inhale that

[Hook]
