Chorus
Tell the whole world get off my dick, Like I dont know any better
Tell the whole world to bump my shit, fuck, you didn't know any better
Fit six in the back of the whip, like we ain't know any better
That's from the rip, like we don't know any better
Like we don't know any better
Like we don't know any better
Like we don't know any better
Like we don't know any better
In the back of the whip
Like we don't know any better
Like we don't know any better

Verse 1

Little homie, you not on my level, I hang with the gods and bang with the devil
I bury em' all pass me the shovel, I piss on your grave then dance on the rubble
Then hop in the whip, looking for trouble
Been stirring the pot, now watch me bubble
Been moving a lot, can't fuck with the hustle
If she giving top, make that whopper a double
I said bring a friend, she told me I'm scandalous
I told her nah, I'm polyamorous
Scream at the box like I'm televangelist
Fuck me to death, then call me ambulance
Pop a viagra, I think I can handle this
She smoke the cannabis, stoned like a amythest
Sipping the syrup, like she was from Canada
We going in, put down the camera

Chorus
Tell the whole world get off my dick, Like I dont know any better
Tell the whole world to bump my shit, fuck, you didn't know any better
Fit six in the back of the whip, like we ain't know any better
That's from the rip, like we don't know any better
Like we don't know any better
Like we don't know any better
Like we don't know any better
Like we don't know any better
In the back of the whip
Like we don't know any better
Like we don't know any better

Verse 2 (Jarren Benton)

I tell the fuck niggas, stop jocking my shit
Skrrrt, I pull up, hop out with the stick
That pussy so good, can't pull out this bitch
You talk too much girl, put your mouth on my dick
It's eastside eastside, yeah the south in this bitch
I'm gone off that dope, so I slouch in the six
The feds got that boy in the house with the bricks
That nigga a snitch he was out by the fifth
Bagged on the first, put him back in the hearst
The code of the streets, swear these black niggas cursed
The bully my boy leave these black niggas murked
I'm old dog from menace, might clap at the clerk
Old boy bout the cheddar, the four by the dresser
I'm paranoid, I feel a whole lot of pressure
These bitches smell money, these niggas gon test ya, no more fucks to give, I don't know any better

Chorus
Tell the whole world get off my dick, Like I dont know any better
Tell the whole world to bump my shit, fuck, you didn't know any better
Fit six in the back of the whip, like we ain't know any better
That's from the rip, like we don't know any better
Like we don't know any better
Like we don't know any better
Like we don't know any better
Like we don't know any better
In the back of the whip
Like we don't know any better
Like we don't know any better



Verse 3 (Aaron Cohen)

Should have been a doctor, should have been a lawyer
Should have went to Georgetown, should have been a Hoya
Should have got a good job from a decent employer
Now you out in Queens, eating ramen, stacking Goya
These rappers won't tell the truth, I'll do it for ya
You ain't got no haters, that's just paranoia
Whole style jacked son, so Latoya
Win Oscars for acting, De la Hoya
Your girl say my name like Inigo Montoya
Call her line, I bet she ignore ya
Not Drake, I don't need to control her
No Bodega, but I thought that I told ya
I'm a motherfucking soldier, Hand on the holster
Heart grew colder as I got older, devil on my shoulder
Looked me in the face, told me I'm taking over
