[Verse 1: Jarren Benton]
East side ATLien
Switchblade to your cranium
Shit's about to get ugly bitch
Ever since I signed with Dame and them
Lame niggas be quiet
I don't fuck with them and don't hang with them
Where are the hoes that suck dick on the first date
Yes I want to spend a day with them
After the show hoes hit the lobby
Mr Benton: A problem probably
Drinking while I text and drive
With a bitch like Ricky Bobby
In a sick Ferrari
Just joking darling
Beg your pardon
Shit I'm starving
Eat a rapper like Olive's Garden
Put his body underneath the garden
Let the flowers blossom
Shit I'm awesome
Damn I'm rad
Death to swag
Bitch I'm grown, fuck my dad
When I bust, catch a bus
Catch a cab
One STD and it was just a crab
Hit the lab and smoke the loudest grass
Arnold Schwarzenegger, break your neck in half

[Verse 2: Plex Boogie]
Hold up, time out
Let me find out
That you ain't down with Spacesuit
I'll put your ass in time out
Ain't nothing but bad bitches
Inside of my radius
I want her, and I want her, and I want her
Simultaneous
I'm in the back seat with freaky Francine
She bouncing on that (on that) like a trampoline
The way she do that
Oh yeah, she a true vet
Man I call her Hanes cause she gave the whole crew neck
I'm hot as fuck
Raising up that Fahrenheit
Look at you, you're a mess
You never fly, you scared of heights
You handcuffing them hoes
Reading off them Miranda Rights
But we ain't loving them hoes
We give 'em space like terabytes
Screaming fuck the world, I'm balls deep
You haters make me sick, raw meat
I could really care less 'bout what you call me
All I really care about is that you know...

[Hook: Stevie]
I'm showin' out
And I'm goin' in
I'm showin' out
And I'm goin' in

[Verse 3: Stevie]
Brewha in my hand
I'm just trying to jam
Trying to get my rocks off before the night come to an end
On that turn up
Yeah I'm going HAM
Fliest nigga out since Tuskegee airman
Hot bitches in the cut looking uber dope
Got all them feeling froggy like they jumping rope
But they jumping off
No roofie flow
Drink got 'em gone, to see 'em you need a telescope
I ball out
No fumble though
Go in every night
That's my status quo
You can't tell me shit
Can't tell us no
We living life
Don't know where we gon' go
Now shorty coming out of her attire
Tube top off, that's something I require
She losing my belt
Bet I make her melt
This dope sauce make her feel better than she ever felt

[Hook]
