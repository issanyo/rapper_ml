[Intro]
Step into a world (Klaka klaka, klaka klaka)
Where there’s no one left (Buku, buku!)
But the very best (Klaka, bo bo, BDP crew)
No MC can test (Bo bo bo bo)

[Verse]
Wishing my nigga was alive and his death was a fucking sick joke
I wanna give y'all me but these niggas just want a skitzo
Daily I feel like I'm under-rated
Despite of any small win I've had, I still wonder if I'ma make it
See every day I'm falling outta love with the music
Make up the dumbest excuses just for me to get through it
Money, pussy and fame is what they put in our brain
So when I wake I feel like there's something I must obtain
I should be raising my fucking kids
But I'm tryna write a verse that'd make 'em raise up their ears
Middle finger up to the 17 year old kid
Who think that Kendrick, Cole and Drake are the only ones spitting shit
Don't be a fucking sheep
And if are, jump in a pool of piss with a cinder block to your feet
I'm hearing shots in my sleep, I wake up and it's me
Behind the barrel, my own blood seeping out my apparel
Now how I come so far? Still think of killin' myself
Negative thoughts and drugs, this shit is killin' my health
This vodka just blanket my insecurities
Other rappers hide behind money, clothes and jewellery
How does a nigga silence a beast?
Everything cool, I'm just out here tryna get peace
I'm no better than you, so I ain't out here just tryna preach
Somewhere I lost myself so I'm out here tryna find me
My world

[Outro]
Step into a world (Klaka klaka, klaka klaka)
Where there’s no one left (Buku, buku!)
But the very best (Klaka, bo bo, BDP crew)
No MC can test (Bo bo bo bo)
