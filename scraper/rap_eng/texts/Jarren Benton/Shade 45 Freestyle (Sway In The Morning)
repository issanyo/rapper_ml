Turn my shit up till the speaker blow
I slap a bitch nigga if he come with that amigo flow
Brass knuckle benton: only rapper that you need to know
Barrel out the window in your hood, I drive the Regal slow
Turn rappers to brain particles
Any problems is raining your brain particles
I wrestle gorillas, this liquor eat through my liver
I will ether you niggas and put your corpse in a river
Money talks and Jesus walks
I'm pulling hoes with brain telepathy: I can read your thoughts
I damage a few crews, god dammit I'm cuckoo
When they coming out with them Back to the Future 2 shoes?
You a bitch, your face glued to a dudes pubes
Doctor Benton I operate with a few tools
Fuck school I stay home and play Mario
I jog around in circles so sad and work on my cardio
I'm with ya bitch sipping boxed wine
I was a teen during Pac's prime
Middle finger to the law, bailing through the stop sign
Nigga stop try, you ain't real reciting a bunch of Pac lines
Them pots purple, I skeet in bitches I'm not fertile
I hang with martians, communicating with crop circles
Yeah, I'm flicking reefer in the ash tray
It's Funk Volume, bitch niggas get the gas face


I rep the east to the babylon
You got a date with death bitch and I'm the chaperon
Turn rappers to fucking bags of bones
I might lace it if I pack the bone
I let the sig push a niggas wig back like LeBron
My gun got a mind of it's own like Megatron
Upper echelon, A-Town is what I'm reppin' hun
Say goodnight to the bad guy, fuck up the restaurant
Mad scientist cook up shit like the chemist
Knock over pyramids I'm a fucking menace to Kemet
You fucking rappers are timid
When Benton's in it you're finished
I cut back on violence, I'm trying to cleanse up my image
I'm leaping out of laptops 'bout to murder computer thugs
No Gillette when this razor is chewing through your mug
Uncle Snoop went through my aunt's purse when he was using drugs
Sensitive rappers you fucking faggots could use a hug
A weirdo with a pierced nose
I tap the bottle, pour some liquor for my niggas slow
2015, I'm making Huxtable figure
Same motto as Donald Sterling: I don't fuck with you niggas
Get out my fucking face nigga
