[Hook] Demrick
Wake up, bake up, roll another one
Thank god I woke up to the morning sun
One day I know that my day will come
Have to face all the fears I’ve been running from

Wake up, bake up, roll another one
Thank god I woke up to the morning sun
One day I know that my day will come
Have to face all the fears I’ve been running from

[Verse 1] Demrick
(Life)
Life is precious, this life is filled with lessons
(Yes)
Some live in the present, others ignore the message
Stresses
Keep mounding daily, won’t let the amount of pressure cave me in..
Won’t let the weight I carry bring me to my very end..
Internet killing all the hope (hope)
When the "likes" start feeling like votes (votes)
Rappers out here stuntin’ on the gram one day
Very next post he's a ghost
Niggas barely even check the post
Busy trying to get the flick and the pose
You ain’t a friend, you a bitch, you a hoe
Lost in the phone, loss of control
Boy, you about to lose your life, keep our eyes on the road
Xans got you in airplane-mode
Holding tight to what you can’t let go
Spending nights in your head all alone
Looking for something to set me free
My mind won’t let me be
Tried of watching life play out from A to Z
Every time before I sleep..

Wake up, bake up, roll another one
Thank god I woke up to the morning sun

[Verse 2] Jarren Benton
Yeah
I wake up to blessings
I’m making progressions
My bitch in my ear, she know I hate all the questions
She swear that I’m cheating
Seen your bitch in my DM
I know she very annoyed ‘cause how I treated my BM
That’s my baby mama
I was all dishonest
I don’t face my fear when they call a nigga wanted
But I can chase the paper, what the fuck the point of stuntin’ when your mind and your soul saying “nigga, I could vomit”
I pray so much I’m ‘bout to need some kneepads
I’ve been drinking too much liquor, need a rehab
See, ain’t even made a meeting nigga relapse
I pop a half a Xan a night so I can relax
Yeah
A nigga may got bands, but I be like god damn
Stress got me cracking like the coke in a hot pan
See the footprints that he left in the hot sand
Never let me down so I left it in God’s hand
Preach
