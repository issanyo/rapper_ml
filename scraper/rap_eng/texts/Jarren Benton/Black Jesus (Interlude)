[Verse]
Black Jesus, fuck your pathetic name and your whack thesis
Your momma's a bitch and so is your fat nieces
In a Lex watchin' Kathy Lee & Regis
No peace in the church they come to clap the heat at preachers
Sick of livin', but he too bitch for slittin' his wrist
Typical nigga shit
Watermelon, chicken, and Schlitz
She got a new ass and spent the grip on lifting her tits
Paranoid smoke I twist a little piff and a spliff, ugh
My favorite rapper fell off at grandmama house
All that cheap ass furniture eatin Kellogg's
Get a little head, the next morning she write a tell-all
I shoulda yoked the bitch but instead i just go the hell off
I'm a- Hard act to follow
Semi-Auto in your fuckin mouth now thats a hard Mac to swallow
Bitches skinny-dippin' in an all black [garado?]
You niggas are played-out like love books and [movado's?]
