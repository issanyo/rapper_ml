[Verse 1: Jarren Benton]
I'm scared, I'm scared of living, I'm scared of dying
I'm scared of falling, I'm scared of flying, I'm scared of failure, I'm scared of trying
I'm scared, I'm scared of losing my kids
Suppressing all of my emotions, scared I might flip and lose my bread
Nigga I'm scared, I'm scared this drinking might take control
Becoming so co-dependent, losing my soul, just thought that I should let you know that
I'm scared, I'm scared of turning out like my daddy
Don't harbor no hard feelings, he may've made mistakes, but still glad the nigga had me
I'm scared, I'm scared my grandma gon' pass away
Any day could be her last, I tell her stay strong and fuck what the doctors say
I'm scared, I'm scared that God don't exist
I'm scared of that dark place I used reside when I ain't had shit
Nigga I'm scared that me and my mom will never get close
Success can be so scary especially when failure's all that I know
I'm scared that my wife gon' end up leaving me
Cause I get shut down so easily, now I can see why you don't believe in me
Cause I'm scared

[Hook: OnCue]
I've been livin' like a stranger in my own head lately
Running out of gas, now go ahead and take me
Look at this monster, yeah this is what you make me
So I scream from the top of my lungs
Top of my lungs
Cause I can barely breathe no more air
I can barely, I can barely breathe, no more

[Verse 2: Jarren Benton]
I'm scared, but ain't scared of none of y'all fuck niggas
I'm scared of gettin' my heart broken, I'm sorry that's why I don't fuck wit' ya
I'm scared of love, I'm scared of pain, I'm scared of music, I'm scared of fame
I'm scared of fucking up my kids psychologically, now who's to blame?
I'm scared I might die alone, some days I might cry alone
I walk along these empty roads, scared I might not make it back home
I'm scared I might lose another friend, I'm scared struggle and sufferin'
I'm scared of my insecurities, but they always there like I'm stuck with them
I'm scared to die over nuttin, I'm scared to stand up for su'in
I'm scared of what you might think of me, I find comfort using this substance
At night I'm scared to go to sleep cause I don't wanna have another nightmare
I'm scared if everything fell apart and I was hurt you wouldn't be right there
And I'm scared, Lord help me overcome fears
It's sunshine after tears, I've been afraid for so many years
And I apologise for anything I've done and pray hard to family and peers
But I'm a fuckin' man and I'll be goddamed if I'ma drown in all of these fears
Nigga who's scared?

[Hook: OnCue]
I've been livin' like a stranger in my own head lately
Running out of gas, now go ahead and take me
Look at this monster, yeah this is what you make me
So I scream from the top of my lungs
Top of my lungs
Cause I can barely breathe no more air
I can barely, I can barely breathe, no more

[Verse 3: Big Rube]
I'm petrified
I don't like this feeling, gotta rectify it
This fight or flight like open mics, when safety's off and I'm next to fire
Livin' scared's livin' dead, fuck being pathetic, I remain kinetic
Steady move forward while trending up, but greater heights mean harder falls
Ain't gotta run down no waterfalls, tryna master fear when you hear the call
Overstand above two-step it up, we can break the bank with these bouncing heads
If you say you can't you already lost to depressing thoughts, it'll drive a wedge
Between you and success, don't see you're blessed
How can you count what you can't percieve?
Fear and loathing's just evil clothing, our core is good, but we don't believe
We deserve the best and I serve the best by giving you what we can't retrieve
This life we live is a precious fight, don't take the punches, gotta bob and weave
Bodies can bust but the mind will snap if we fall into their traps kill our belief

[Hook: OnCue]
I've been livin' like a stranger in my own head lately
Running out of gas, now go ahead and take me
Look at this monster, yeah this is what you make me
So I scream from the top of my lungs
Top of my lungs

I can barely, I can barely breathe, no more
