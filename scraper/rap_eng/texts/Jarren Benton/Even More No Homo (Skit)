No homo or nothing, man, but I'm just trying to say like...
Hey, I don't know how to...
I really don't know how to say this, man, but like yo...
Ever since that last conversation I think things went kind of a little south, you know?

No homo, bro, but listen...
I've got feelings for you, bro
Everybody's been telling me I was gay, but I was like
"Nah, I'm not gay, bro. No homo. Really. I'm not gay, bro."

You know... people like...
Hey, you eat that hotdog weird and I'm like
"No, I don't, man
This is how people eat hotdogs
They swallow them like that."
Why do people think that that's gay?
I don't think that's gay
So I don't see... I think you gay for thinking that's gay

I mean like yo... No homo bro, but I know you've seen them porns and all of a sudden it's like three people
Two dudes and one girl
You like "Hey, that chick's gonna get it
Oh wait... Oh oh! They touching!"
I mean, if two dicks bump, why is that gay?
That ain't gay
That's just like two dudes like
"Heeey I'm more manly!"
That's like a manhood test, you feel me?
No homo. Definitely no homo
Two dicks touching; no homo, bro
Two dicks bumping tip to tip; kinda homo, but if side to side and like slapping each other a little bit, you know?
You shove them and giggle a little bit...
That ain't gay. You just having fun
You wrapped up in the moment
Bro, come on!
No homo. Really though. No homo. Definitely

Listen bro... You know me, bro...
We go back, bro. I am no homo
No, everybody now I ain't gay!
Listen... Just cause I kissed that dude one time at the club, everybody like
"Oh, he gay!"
I ain't gay, man! He kissed me
I didn't kiss him! He came up to me when I was drinking and was like"Hey!" and then he kissed me in my shit
What am I supposed to do?
Push him off? What the fuck?
I'm not a dickhead!
No homo bro, but that dude had some good smelling breath that night and his cologne was off the chain
I forgot to ask him what the hell that shit was though
No homo, bro. Come on, man!

Hello? Hey, you there? Hello?
