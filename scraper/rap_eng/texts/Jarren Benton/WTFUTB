[Verse 1]
Bring home the bacon and broccoli
A-Town monopoly
Brass knuckle Benton, no fuck niggas stopping me
Break 'em up properly
Ill nigga fuck up your Empire, stick my dick raw in Taraji P
I come from a era where niggas wear Polos and swimming trunks
Put the gun through the back of your lil' sister head, told the bitch to get in the trunk
Ándale, ándale, I blew 100k
Interstellar bitch like Mathew McConaughey
These niggas wilding, they won't put they guns away
They want their cheddar, buy blue cheese and monterey
I'm trying to smash a Kardashian
Crawl through the check then I cash it in
I'm after the throne no Baratheon
Make sure these niggas can't rap again
[Pre-Chorus]
Grew up with roaches inside of my Frosted Flakes
Now I am having an awesome day
I come and eat and you all are prey
The bully is here bitch you all should pray
Make sure the pistol a toss-away
Cause if that fuck nigga get out of line
He finna get his ass off today

[Hook]
Boy what the fuck is you talking 'bout
What the fuck is you talking 'bout
What the fuck is you talking 'bout
What the fuck is you talking 'bout
Got a hell of a squad over here, what the fuck is you talking 'bout
What the fuck is you talking 'bout
What the fuck is you talking 'bout
What the fuck is you talking 'bout
Nigga we cashing checks over here, what the fuck is you talking 'bout
What the fuck is you talking 'bout
What the fuck is you talking 'bout

Nigga we fucking hoes over here, what the fuck is you talking 'bout
What the fuck is you talking 'bout
What the fuck is you talking 'bout

We ain't gon' lose over here, what the fuck is you talking 'bout

[Verse 2]
I got the juice, brand new bishop and Q
Nigga you broke, no one listens to you
Fuck nigga, don't you got dishes to do
I'm up in the hills, what a different view
Amber alert, shit I'm missing [?]
Mo' money, mo' problems, new bitching to do
The dope boy, he fucked up a kitchen or two
My girl think I'm loyal, that bitch is a fool
R-I-P Big L, I borrowed that line
My uncle on crack, want to borrow my 9
These haters throw shade, want to borrow my shine
They switch up and transform like Optimus Prime
Son of a gun like I came from a Tec, niggas came for your neck, cause we came for the check
Netflix and chill, bitch I came for the sex
And she don't swallow cum so I came on her neck
[Pre-Chorus]
Put your money on me, nigga I am the underdog
God told me go to the top, Jarren shine, get the fuck from up under y'all
Them niggas like Jay, we can talk it out
When that cartridge come out, niggas walk it out
Them haters say Jarren, you crazy you ain't gonna make it, I look at 'em

[Hook]
Boy what the fuck is you talking 'bout
