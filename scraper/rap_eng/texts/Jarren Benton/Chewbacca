[Intro: Jarren Benton]
K-K-Kato On The Track bitch

[Verse 1]
Diamonds on me dance like Hammer
Clique go bananas, still rep the East of Atlanta
Thots walk, never see the keys to the Phantom (skrr)
Fuck Trump I'ma take a knee during Anthem, yah
Fuck a bad drop and bounce back
One two three Mil baby count that
If I ain't a ill nigga tell me what you call that
Busy getting paper tell the bitch to call back (brrrp)
Hello, money phone
Ain't wrapped tight nigga somethin' wrong
Boujee nigga sippin' on Pérignon
Kato on the the track kill the niggas al somalian
Son of Sam, need a hunid bands, bad bitch, no xans
Dirty ass hoe stay runnin' scams
Give her dick it make the bitch do the runnin' man
Going loco in Tokyo, murder fest had to go reload
My lil bitch keep the stogies rolled
Going hard you see more results count the bread right before we go, this the year of the Scorpio
Bitch you know how the story go I want the fame and the glory hole I turn a bitch to a gory show
I'm at ya head with a torpedo (brr brr)

[Chorus]
Fur on my back like Chewbacca (Mink)
Live like I'm dying tomorrow (No fucks)
You are not real you imposter (Aye)
King of the jungle Mufasa (King)
Fur on my back like Chewbacca (Gucci)
King of the jungle Mufasa (God)
Live like I'm dying tomorrow (No fucks)
Live like I'm dying tomorrow (No fucks)

[Verse 2]
Fur on my back like Chewbacca (Mink)
You are not real you imposter (Fake)
Never take hoes to Mi casa (Nope)
King of the jungle Mufasa (God)
I grew up without a father (Fuck em)
We did not make it to Harvard (Drop out)
Kilos of Coke on the Harbor (Bricks)
Fuck the PI die of Martyr (Die)
Live like I'm dying tomorrow (No fucks)
Cadillac's, Chevy's, Impalas (Skrrt)
Spray Vodka straight out the bottle
[?] my hoe look like models (Beyoncé)
I'm sorry but I feel no sorrow (None)
No fucks to gives or to borrow (No heart)
You think that these niggas got pussys (Bitches)
They gossip like bitches on Bravo (Nini)
Mr. Benton I have risen lord if you don't do with it then what you living for, losing patience kicking in the door these niggas crazy hit emballie in the porch we drink the pain away so hit the liquor store, if it ain't murder what you grip the trigger for

King of the jungle Mufasa (God)
Live like I'm dying tomorrow (No fucks)
Live like I'm dying tomorrow (No fucks)

Fur on my back like Chewbacca (Mink)

You are not real you imposter (Aye)
King of the jungle Mufasa (King)
Fur on my back like Chewbacca (Gucci)
