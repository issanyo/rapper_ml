[Intro: Vedo]
Track killas
Too playa for that
It's Vedo, baby, yeah

[Pre-Chorus: Vedo]
I chose up, and you chose me
I don't know why you act so insecure
Your homegirls don't know me
Keep diggin', you gon' find what you lookin' for
Callin' me from a blocked phone
Runnin' game, baby why you tryna catch me up?
Do I remember Keisha?
Ha, I reply "wrong number"

[Chorus: Vedo]
Too playa for that
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Baby, I'm too playa for that
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Too playa for that
Homegirls in my DM (oh)
Actin' like I'm hittin' on them
Tell your girls fall back
Got your girls callin' my line (oh)
Tryna catch me slippin', but I'm
Too playa for that

[Verse 1: Vedo]
OG said never shit where you stay
Keep it G, never do it broad day
Too playa for that
I get in and get gone before the morning
I never make 'em feel like they own it
Don't let your friends get you cut off (cut off), cut off
Goin' out your way tryna get a nigga cut off
Baby, can't you see they wanna jump on it?
I really hope that you don't fall for it (oh)

[Pre-Chorus: Vedo]
I chose up, and you chose me
Tell me why you gotta be so insecure
Your homegirls don't know me
Ooh, soon enough you gon' find what you lookin' for
Callin' me from a blocked phone
Runnin' game, tell me why you tryna catch me up
Do I remember Keisha?
Ha, I reply "wrong number"

[Chorus: Vedo & Jerry Benton]
Too playa for that
Oh, oh, oh, oh (ooh, whoa)
Baby, I'm too playa for that
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Too playa for that
Homegirls in my DM
Actin' like I'm hittin' on them
Tell your girls fall back
Got your girls callin' my line (yeah)
Tryna catch me slippin', but I'm (Jerry Benton)
Too playa for that (yeah, what up?)

[Verse 2: Jarren Benton]
Yeah, I'm a player, I ain't fallin' for the okie-doke (no)
Baby, I'm a Scorpio, you should peep the horoscope (ha)
Goin' through my phone tryna turn this to a horror show (what?)
Why the hell you trippin? I'm a pimp, yeah you ain't know?
Frontin' like you loyal, just deceivin' my mind
You ain't see me with no other girl, you legally blind
Yeah, why the hell my BM keep on goin' through my DM?
Bitch, you never catch me slippin' 'cause I'm

[Chorus: Vedo]
Too playa for that
Oh, oh, oh, oh (whoa, oh)

Got your girls callin' my line (oh)
Tryna catch me slippin', but I'm
Too playa for that

[Verse 3: Vedo]
Had you wishin' me the best (oh)
But you put me through the worst
Too playa for that (oh)
I gave you everything I had
And this how you pay me back (back)
So I'm on to the next

Girl, you on that bullshit

Oh, thank your friends for that

[Chorus: Vedo]
I'm too playa for that
Oh, oh, oh, oh (oh)
Baby, I'm too playa for that (oh, oh)
