Kato on the track bitch

[Chorus: Reezy]
Hey, I pull up and get it n go
And all of my hitters will go and all of my bitches will go
The minute I hit I go, I pull up and get it n go
I hit a lick and I go, all of my bitches'll go
The minute I get it ill go, I pull up and get it n go
Pull up and get it n go, pull up and get it n go
I pull up and get it n go, I pull up and get it n go

[Verse 1: Jarren Benton]
Pull up I get it go to get my money movin' slow
Had to cut em off, some niggas had to go
I went back and dough, a nigga had to grow
Before the status quo, I'm not your average Joe
Dranked up, dripped out, stack doughs, fuck hoes
Bitch bounce, hoes give me discount
Gucci down, pimped out, work hard, get clout

[Verse 2: Price]:
16 got kicked out, flippin' dimes and nicks now
I remember when they shot up Anthony at Nick house, whole family tripped out
It's like Drake and Alicia Keys whenever Price pull his wrist out, fireworks trip down
She fucked the worth at the work and I tell her to strip down, call her Lyft now
Can't let you hoes get too close, please don't be callin' me bro
I'm movin' legit gettin' dough, no you not hittin' my smoke
I just get lifted after shows, don't gotta hit licks no more
But won't let you take nothin' from me, don't let your ass owe me some money

[Chorus: Reezy]
Hey, I pull up and get it n go
And all of my hitters will go and all of my bitches will go
The minute I hit I go, I pull up and get it n go
I hit a lick and I go, all of my bitches'll go
The minute I get it ill go, I pull up and get it n go
Pull up and get it n go, pull up and get it n go
I pull up and get it n go, I pull up and get it n go

[Verse 3: Demrick]
Matte black range rover tinted out, racks hidden in the house
Bad bitch, turn her round, bend her down, baby yeah work it out
Young wild and reckless, diamond Henny bottle necklace
No lames in my section, smoke or not ain't a question, yeah

[Verse 4: Dizzy Wright]
Switch back, hit this, I told lil mama stop flexin'
Chit chat, fuck that, I told her bring that ass in my direction
I gotta get my point across, is you with it or you not?
Wordsmith, twist up, I pull up and get it n go, I gotta get it now
What it mean I'm boutta be the boss
Be about your business, never let them play you out
Hit the city, hit the stage, shirt tucked in, black Bruce Lee style
And I'm blowin' clouds, tellin' Price like, they don't know the tribulations and trials
They don't know the situation, they don't know what we go thru when ain't nobody else 'round

[Chorus: Reezy]
Hey, I pull up and get it n go
And all of my hitters will go and all of my bitches will go
The minute I hit I go, I pull up and get it n go
I hit a lick and I go, all of my bitches'll go
The minute I get it ill go, I pull up and get it n go
Pull up and get it n go, pull up and get it n go
I pull up and get it n go, I pull up and get it n go

[Verse 6: Emilio Rojas]
I'm sittin' in the middle of the city with the cash
I'ma hit a hundred fifty on the dash
All the women that are with me and they bad
When I get 'em in the pad then I hit it they gonna splash
I did it to be livin' in a tenement so when we get the money we just set it in the stash
Yeah, we get it and we never gonna be settlin' for less
If you meddle, then you know we gonna clash
Shorty worried about a fat transfer, I'm just worried about a bank transfer
No ID call my phone but that's the type of call that I can't answer
Runnin' 'round I'm in uptown, I'm with a bunch of kings that speak bad Spanish
Comin' around to my block and you got no pass, nigga taxed after like

[Chorus: Reezy]
Hey, I pull up and get it n go
And all of my hitters will go and all of my bitches will go
The minute I hit I go, I pull up and get it n go
I hit a lick and I go, all of my bitches'll go
The minute I get it ill go, I pull up and get it n go
Pull up and get it n go, pull up and get it n go
I pull up and get it n go, I pull up and get it n go
