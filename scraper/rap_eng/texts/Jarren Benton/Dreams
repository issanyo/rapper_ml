[Hook (2X)]
We just wishin’ on the ghetto stars
Money, clothes, hoes and cars
Ridin’ dirty in my city streets
Blowin’ half a O and go and chase my dreams
Yeah, swear a nigga got dreams

[Verse 1]
Wish upon a ghetto star
Clutchin’ on my hopes and dreams
Some niggas won’t make it
Sorry y’all but that’s the way it seems
Put this crack on paper
He puts his on top of triple beams
Different ways to get it but we all just want the same thing
Opportunity’s a limit, there’s some niggas slayin’ ‘cane
Makin’ out of this nightmare, swear it’s hard to maintain
Underneath Graffiti Bridge searchin’ for a decent vein
What’s inside this needle is the only thing that ease my pain
Scariest feelin’ is not knowin’ how to make it one more day
So we meditate and pray, hope to God I find my way
Cause right now I’m not okay
So I take it day by day, and hope these worries go astray
I’m relyin’ on these words to put my kids to better places
Call it crazy all the choices that niggas not educated
Barely made it over some obstacles that I’ve seen
Try not to loose my life for my sanity, when I chase my dreams

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Wish upon a ghetto star
Hope my grandma’s sickness vanish
Think about her frequently
Anxiety, I sit and panic
Hope you know I love you even though I don’t express it much
I’m just tryna make it, niggas starvin’ out here desperate
Infatuated with not bein’ a loser or a lame
Money talks, I did not write the rules to all these games
Hoes flock when money comes
Bitch is you insane?
She just out here tryna get it
You can’t fuck away your pain
Who am I kiddin’, I can drink away mine neither
I didn’t know that you was hurtin’ too
I am no mind reader
And we let our demons destroy the love that we built for one another
Say some hateful shit we don’t mean, ain’t that a muthafucka?
You know I love when I do this shit for y’all
Apologize for everything, my back’s against the wall
Barely made it over some obstacles that I’ve seen
And I prayin’ not to lose you every day, when I chase my dreams
