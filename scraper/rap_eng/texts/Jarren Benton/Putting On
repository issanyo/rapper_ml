[Verse 1]
Hopsin said fuck the label
Dizzy he stuck with Dame
SwizZz working on his album
And me, bitch I'm still insane
Popped a few pills to deal with the pain
Prefer the money over fame
She'll fuck for a gram of cocaine
Goddamn fame is such a cool thing
Used to stand by the stove when the heat was off
The preachers couldn't reach me what Jesus taught
That's the same language that kept the slaves in line
I walk out the house I'mma bring my nine
I don't trust a broke nigga's frame of mind
These fuck niggas all wear the same designs
I'm still the shit through the change of times
Toast to the real have a drink of wine
I woke up like this, why the fuck is you living?
I take your life if you fuck with my children
Forensics came and scraped his brains off the ceiling
I just fucking dipped don't play with the feelings
I'm just in this bitch to make me some millions
Fuck the middle man we made us a killing
Spilling liquor got a stain on my linen
We give no fucks about the way that you feeling

[Bridge]
We the ones that got it popping nigga
We go hard like ain't no options nigga
Can't stop these choppers, get to chopping niggas
Fuck the way you feeling

[Hook]
We the ones that putting on
Put on, Put on, Put on, (x2)
We the ones that putting on

[Verse 2]
We the ones that putting on
I put a hundred in her thong
She let me fuck cause I'm a rapper
Send her back home with no make up on
This game turned my heart to an icebox
I used to wear Reeboks and Izods
I still bump OutKast on my iPod
When she throw that ass back I'm like "My god"
I told that lil' bitch I got money to make
How can I stomach the hate?
Fuck around get a gun in your face
Don't fuck up your day and get punched in the face
I walk in this bitch like I'm running the place
Bitch we still movin' you running in place
Kick down the door when we run through to say
"I'm friends with the plug, I can front you the base"
This sound like that dope in your veins
Young nigga I notice your pain
Days with no money had drove us insane
Did so much drugs I got holes in my brain
Far from my circle we know you a lame
We go so hard when we go in the paint
This that new crack but the stove look the same
Slow Motion 2 put your nose in this 'cain

[Bridge]
We the ones that got it popping nigga
We go hard like ain't no options nigga
Can't stop these choppers, get to chopping niggas
Fuck the way you feeling

[Hook]
We the ones that putting on
Put on, Put on, Put on, (x2)
We the ones that putting on
