[Intro]
Whoa, I'm really fucking high man!

[Verse 1: JaeWhompus]
I came from outer space there's an alien in my brain
I've done a ton of drugs their probably ingrained
I'm rolling with these martians and they never look the same
Mushrooms loratabs weed liquor add some 'caine
I'm on a drug binge I've been up for six days
I don't know who I am and I'm lost in this cave
I'll never be the same I'm probably insane
I kicked through the glass illusions hiding in my brain
I'm loving and guzzling these drugs again
Popping and dropping these pills again
Cutting and snorting these coke again
Picking and eating these 'shrooms again
I've lost my fucking mind for the very last time
Me and busyblunt broke the glass precipice
Come to find out I'm really MaCubus
Earthly angel you call me a demon
Roaming through the streets you call me a heathen
You tried to kill me but I'm still breathin'
Crossing a river that's known as time
DXM made me climb I'm plateauing through the sky
My life is on the fucking line
Man I'm really higher than I've ever been before
Flying through space but I'm really on the floor
Mama Freaking out paramedics at my door
Running butt naked I'm busting through the door

[Hook: JaeWhompus] x 2

Man I'm really higher than I've ever been before
Mushrooms loratabs weed liquor maybe more
I'm chilling with some aliens running through some sand
I jumped in a river where time began

[Verse 2: SwizZz]

Yo I'm rolling drinking smoking fuck
Higher but I wanna get higher dog
Forget about it who does the driving dog?
I'm a push it to the limit then I'm signing off
Bye goodbye I'm heading to the sky with cape on
Or maybe in the booth like a payphone with aplomb?
Sending motherfucking napalm (That's Fire)
Come put it out if you dare
I feel like fucking a bitch with no hair
The sight of any y'all with that low pro fare?
While I shit she can sit on my dick like a chair
Yes I'm strange but I really don't care
We inhale kush smoke something like air
You can tell we're tired we need a spare
Then we put that bitch on and we go back on the ter (RA)?
The room is spinning my brew is spilling my boo is tripping so lovely
The mood is chilling the goo? is feeling like I'm sitting on a cloud so comfy
Oh Yeah take a seat with me get lost in the moment until it's make believe
Shit let your mind drift of to sea until your fucking mermaids on a sandy beach
(Yep Yep) Get it hat still fitted
Got niggas staring every time I pivot
I can't stop now because I see no limits
And pretend to fall back just and watch me (GET IT)
Don't worry about much (Nope)
My blunts always so stuffed (Yep)
Got no hair on my nuts (Yep)
So their silky smooth to the touch (Yep)
I sway crowds when I bust (Yep)
I take my time and don't rush (Yep)
That whiskey bottle is a must if you plan to kick it with us (Shit)
Remind me I'm outta my mind again I'll let your ass know one more time again
I'm fine good great and back on my grind again (Bitch)

[Hook] x 2

[Verse 3: Jarren Benton]
Ride around on my side of town
I don't blow an O of that bobby brown (NO)
I say bitch I got my mojo back who the fuck you gonna get to stop me now (HAA)
Hello haters yellow gators toss a bitch of the escalator
Y'all niggas know I'm fresh to death and bitch you still hooked to the respirator (Yeah)
House full of hoes like moulin rouge y'all niggas gay like 2 Wong Foo
I gotta Chinese hoe that do kung fu suck dick and cook a nigga wonton soup (HAA)
Ready or not here I come for you gotta blade that really wanna come for you
I'm a cannibal animal old dirty bastard I'll put a motherfucker in the Brooklyn zoo
I'm high as fuck high as fuck I inhale when I light it up
I got promethazine inside my cup
And yo' bitch with us and her minds corrupt (Yeah)
Sour diesel I grind it up and I just might do a line of dust
And we don't sip that expensive shit them PBR's are fine with us
I'm sitting on top of the world like Hi y'all (Hi)
Might sniff the paint off the dry wall
Get a buzz off anything at home trying to sniff the fumes from a can of Lysol (HAA)
Who the fuck turned the lights off where the q-tips shaahe? and five? dog
I'm swerving on 285 in a old school caddie draped out with rain and white walls (HAA)
I'm blurring them lines Give me a minute I'm probably just fine
I can't even walk and I can't even talk what the fuck am I on (I guess I'm outta my mind)
Doctor Doctor can you please fix him I'm out in Cali need a weed prescription
Geez I'm tripping and my knees are twitching there I go again fighting these addictions (HAA)

[Outro Hook]

Man I'm really higher than I've ever been before
Mushrooms loratabs weed liquor maybe more
I'm chilling with some aliens running through some sand
I jumped in a river where time began
Man I'm really higher than I've ever been before
Mushrooms loratabs weed liquor maybe more
I'm chilling with some aliens running through some sand
I jumped in a river where time began
Man I'm really higher than Ive ever been before
Flying through space but I'm really on the floor
I'm smoking with some aliens chilling on the beach
We jumped in a river where time crept
Man I'm really higher than I've ever been before
Mushrooms loratabs weed liquor maybe more
Flying through space but I'm really on the floor
I jumped in a river where time began
