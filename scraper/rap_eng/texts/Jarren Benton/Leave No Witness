[Intro: Jarren Benton]
Yeah, Jarren
I ain't gonna say my last name nigga, you know what it is (say your last name nigga)
DJ mother fucking Hoppa
Your DJ ain't no DJ
He just hit the instant replay, nigga

[Verse 1: Jarren Benton]
Bitch I break the law of gravity ain't no way that Jarren's falling off
I write like my hand's possessed, I had to gnaw that fucker off
Scared of what, all you niggas soft that I come across
Bust out this fucking straight jacket and bite the buckle off
Old school Corvette, colored as mustard sauce
I speak a different language, fuck discussions with y'all
I para sail the Mediterranean
Your bullets couldn't penetrate the god, my skeleton's titanium
Crazy as a Tasmanian Israelian
Now watch you lame niggas hang from a noose with your feet dangling
Rappers need strangling, I punch out of a pine box
And leap out of the bowels of the devil, subterranean
I fell out of love with that bitch called Hip Hop
Freezer full of rapper's arteries in a Ziploc
Fuck off and kick rocks you fuckers don't get props
I get my dick sucked while I'm bumping Kid Rock

[Hook: Demrick] (x2)
This the shit that you don't know about
You don't live this
Kick the door in at your momma's house
Leave no witness
You a killer or a motormouth
There's a difference
Niggas ride for what they all about
Till it's finished

[Verse 2: SwizZz]
I'm not a killer but don't push me, we all have our limits
Your foolish actions are dictated by the drinks you sippin'
And that's gonna leave you in a bad position
A drunk tongue bred bad intentions and I'm ready to get this over with
Fuck your corporate ties and phoney biz
Purpose and content we got more to give
And more to offer, useful verb, I'm not a fast talker
When I'm done she'll have bad posture she'll be stumbling and walking awkward
I ain't here to satisfy your vices
And I will not be the comfort to cushion your lonely nights with
I turn them on, light switch, I turn them off, light switch
I'm mixed like decisions but the flow is so decisive
We are not enticed by the life you glamorize
That's your ego in disguise I will quickly testify
There's no love for impostors
Shout out to Brass Knuckle Benton, Demrick and my valley pal DJ Hoppa

[Hook: Demrick] (x2)
