(Jarren's Verse Only)

[Verse 1: Jarren Benton]
Live from the east side of GA
Your throat got a date with this chain saw blade
Don't be late
I'm scorching, I cremate
Create
Shit that'll make you decay
Hating ass nigga suck my D-I-C-K
No hablo Ingles
Word to Enrique
Iglesias
Grandmama pray for us
You prey to us
We roll it up and lace it up with Angel Dust
And hit it 'til it strangle us
No church in the wild bitch we Athiest
Kill a microphone
You a fucking maric√≥n
Can't kick his way out of a wet bag of styrofoam
Bite the fucking barrel of your firearm
Cut your fucking face off and try it on
Five greatest rappers
Dylan, Dylan, Dylan, Dylan, and Dylan
No, it's Jarren Benton with the nylon
Stocking on his face and the xylophone
Ain't no telling what pharmaceutical that I am on
