[Intro]
DJ Hoppa

[Verse 1: Emilio Rojas]
I am young and Hispanic and proud
And I be a uno so when I ride dolo it still like I stand with a crowd
Understandin' me now, your infantry still in its infancy
You listen to cannon, go blaow, he grinnin' and tatted me now
Emilio been blackin' out, I don't even flinch
I be grabbin' benjamins and y'all penny pinch
I done seen some shit, we be gettin' in the whip and we don't even bitch
When I pull up in the 'Nali and its matte black
Liberty up on his neck with a gas mask
Dizzy pullin' in with the loud and he pass that
I be with a pretty little thing but her ass fat
Yeah like Alexis Texas, I phone exs on iPhone Xs
I don't let chicks take no photos, I just make sure the iPhone exits
I don't let it enter the room, I don't need the evidence
Just use your memory boo when I enter your womb, Emilio deadin' it
What's up?

[Verse 2: Price]
Price is young and he black and he proud
I used to write raps on the couch
At 13 was the man of the house
If it ain't pure then I'd rather be out
I keep a Nefertiti around
Seen her liftin', we breakin' the bed
Niggas always be loafin' around
Probably why you ain't makin' no bread

[Verse 3: Oktane]
I'm from Cali the home of the loud, I-E where nobody's allowed
Everywhere I steppin' its a crowd, man this how to ride in the towns
Yea, I don't talk too much, just know one drop one touch
Your whole clan, that's lunch, yeah I'm the man one punch

[Verse 4: Jarren Benton]
I rep the A and I'm proud, I'ma keep the pounds of the loud
I'ma be down in the south, I'ma keep countin' that clout
Pull up pop out, wet the whole block like an S-curl
Y'all niggas fake like Westworld, head game strong you the best girl
Game over, nigga our turn, the bullet, homie, niggas gotta learn
Too much Henny give me heartburn, I'm just curvin' bitches like a sharp turn
Vamanos, vamanos, I let the llama go, you should be honored hoe
You in the presence of God, y'all niggas presence are odd
Yo bitch keeps pressin' the squad, she gave us neck in this dodge
Y'all show respect to the mob, Emilio, rip out his heart
I'm in a pit with the sharks, you run your lips to the narcs
You know this shit can get dark, bitch we get lit from the start
Spliff of that Chico DeBarge, I pull the heat on the mark
Dizzy OG in the jar, you know he's a retard, nigga ugh

[Verse 5: Dizzy Wright]
I'm from Vegas the city of lies, pimps and hoes, strip life
But follow no silly advice, get your bread and get right
One punch, Mike Tyson style, bring Dizzy right around
We gon' knock 'em out the final round, and not like he been givin' me life
Chillin' in the sky like UFOs, shootin' star, fly? Hell yeah
Independent gotta keep 'em on they toes
Shut up baby, hit the corner store
Melanin, melanin, melanin, might just hit 'em with the sunbeam
I told my bitch don't put nothin' on but your tongue ring
Y'all pussies can't run things, so I take 'em places they never been
A livin' legend, let me come clean, I'm only playin' for one team
Hustle mentality, say what I want don't be mad at me
Peace, love for showin' love, but this is how it had to be
Now we goin' in

[Verse 6: Demrick]
What the fuck you mean? Competiton don't exist
Try to throw against, we just scratch 'em off the list
Talk my shit bitch, I hope you take offense
Just know I'ma get it boy, as long as paper prints
What the fuck you mean? Competiton don't exist
Try to throw against, we just scratch em off the list
Talk my shit bitch I hope you take offense
Just know I'ma get it boy, as long as paper prints
