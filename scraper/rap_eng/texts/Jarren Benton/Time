[Verse 1]
And I'm holding back tears
I'm so scared I can't expose this fear
I'm supposed to be so ahead this year
I'm still at the starting line
Man the pain just appears
Maybe I should let it go
Dreams drift away then the moonlight glows
"She don't want you no more, Jarren, let the bitch go"
Feel a void in my soul as she walk out the door
Is it more to a man's ambition
Then to be a musician for the whole world to listen
And I don't want to be a statistic
"Come on wake up JB where you listing"
Only a few niggas make it
Your options is minimal with no education
They say think logical
Stress will make a mother fucker think diabolical
And I don't wanna give up
And I don't wanna wake some days but I get up
And I been hurting so long from a dream
A gift from god to hold on

[Verse 2]
I'm still holding onto tears
Thought my grandma was gonna pass away this year
And I was so sad
Don't let her pass while I'm stuck in New York I'm at my home boys pad
Just thinking, I ain't spend enough time
Caught up in my own shit I had a tough time
Trying to be a rap legend, husband and a father
I ain't spoken with my mama in a week it's getting harder
And why is it so hard for me to express love
To a woman that would give me the world that's so bum
I feel numb
Unenthusiastic, devoted so much time and my mind to this rap shit
I can't get back time
No delorian, no button to push rewind
I think I'm losing my mind
Somebody lie to me everything will be fine
