[Verse 1]
I'm done giving a fuck, I'm not carin'
2Pac, reserve me a new spot in Heaven!
Nah, I'm not well
Lucifer, reserve me a cool spot in Hell!
I'm too hot to fail
Too pretty for jail
I pity the fool that's fucking with dude's mail
Incredible Hulk, you dudes are too frail
I puff two ales, get drunk from brew ill
Yeah, something's wrong with his cranium
I kidnapped a Martian, traded brains with an alien
You better watch what you say to him
He's on punishment nigga, do not play with him
Mac needle, I'm that evil, I'm that lethal
Rob you for your chains and rings, I'm like Sm√©agol
R2D2, Cadillacs, and Regal
Cocaine, Valium, mushrooms, and needles, nigga

[Hook]x2
If you take a look in my eyes
You'll see I'll be an asshole 'til I die
Them shots of Hangar 1 got me so alive
Jarren tell 'em where you from, nigga eastside

[Verse 2]
I'll break inside your house
Kick my feet on your couch
Punch your bitch in the mouth
Eat your food and bounce
A junkyard dog, a mack with a chainsaw
Have it your way, I'm gnawing your brains off
These rap A&Rs, they faggots, they all soft
2010 version of Adolf...
Hitler, these niggas want beef and steak sauce
I crush bones and snap necks and break jaws
These old ass jerks say "J, you need a hit!"
But the new kids love it, you're gay, go suck dick
I feel like a monster's trapped in my soul
I keep feeding him rappers and hope he'll go home
Shoo guy! Come back here, like, next year
I party like a white boy: pot and Pabst beer
You motherfuckers panic, you're right, it's my year
I'm finna check pussies, give niggas a pap smear, you bitch

[Hook]
