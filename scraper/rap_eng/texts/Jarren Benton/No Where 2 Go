[Verse 1]
Wife's still bitchin'
I'm in the kitchen
I ain't cooking crack, no, nigga that's fried chicken
Pop 2 of these, get high and ride with 'em
It's Russian Roulette, survive or die with 'em
If one more fag say swag
I'm-a probably fucking gag, get mad, and whoop his ass
Haha, look at that, Jarren's irritated
I can't breathe bitch, I'm hyperventilating
I'm antisocial, fuck this conversation
My wife say "chill, just drink in moderation"
Yep, it's the inauguration
Of a pessimistic rapper that's waiting to kick your face in
I'm trying to bring hardcore back
Nigga's in the club with a baseball bat
They say "we don't like the way y'all rap
Got a semi-automatic, better pay y'all tax"
Bougie whores say "Jarren we don't get you"
Don't ever disrespect me again, bitch I'll hit you
Jarren got issues, life's so hard
You nerds heard it first with the fucking beat gods

[Hook]
Breakers, skaters
B-boys, haters
Oh, everybody fuck that
Still nowhere to go
Yeah, still nowhere to go

[Verse 2]
Nigga I'm ill
Still got bills
Past due collection, nigga that's real
So how can I chill
When unemployment sucks
Tap dance for the man like "sir, I give a fuck!"
My economy is fucked
The rap game's fucked
Dumb nigga spent his last on some rims for his truck
And I still pray to be a legend in the game
But the vision's now jaded cause of bullshit and pain
So how can I deal with the bullshit and lame
I just want to fly away, fuck the bullshit and fame
My attitude's reckless
Snatch a rapper's necklace
And beat a nigga's ass at the drive-thru at Checkers
1 word: love
Too much drugs
Got me passed the fuck out on my grandma's rug
Jarren got issues, life's so hard
You nerds heard it first with the fucking beat gods

[Hook]

[Outro]
"Yeah nigga
Ayy, my motherfuckin' swag's so serious nigga
I wake up, I put on a motherfuckin' swag jacket nigga
I put swag motherfuckin' syrup on my pancakes nigga when I wake up nigga
Swagger, swagger, swagger, nigga
My swag this, my swag--"
(Gunshot)
Nigga shut the fuck up about your fucking swag
This is fucking music at it's fucking best
Jarren Benton
That bitch ain't fucking dead nigga I just fucking shook that bitch
Get the fuck up bitch
You ain't dead
You ain't dead bitch!
