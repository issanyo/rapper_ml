[Hook]
Outta my brain, I'm going out of my brain
Outta my brain, you best get out my way
Spend my days wondering if I'm okay
Cause I'm outta my brain

[Verse 1: Bernz]
Yeah!
Think I dove off the deep end
Got too fucked up last weekend
Think I need to go repent
Before I finish charging my G-Pen
I don't know what I'm seekin'
Why I keep the hotel room reekin'
Phone full of freaks it's indecent
Grand-mama said I need Jes-us
Everybody wanna tell me I should slow down
And just hold out, for that safe flight
I don't really want to down-shift, but going too fast to hit stop lights
I'm gon' hit it hard till the fuel's gone
There's no rooftops, you can't do wrong
R.I.P. to my neutrons
Been abusing them for just too long

[Hook]
Outta my brain, I'm going out of my brain
Outta my brain, you best get out my way
Spend my days wondering if I'm okay
Cause I'm outta my brain

[Verse 2: Bernz]
Ha!
Yo, I think I'm losing it
Going out of my brain I'm a lunatic
To be honest, I'm used to it
I feel like I hacked my computer chip
Homie, I've been doing this
I've been lighting spliffs, I've been through the fifth
I'm through arguing with you derelicts
I'm trying to find a chick and just shoot the shit
I'm a product of the fast life
I can't slow down, I gotta hold on tight
Deuces to the rear-view, I can't U-turn, I can't stop my flight
Turned up in the headphones
And if it's too loud, I hope that that's alright
What I'm saying is it's all good, since I let go and I lost my mind

[Hook:]
Outta my brain, I'm going out of my brain
Outta my brain, you best get out my way
Spend my days wondering if I'm okay
Cause I'm outta my brain

[Verse 3: Jarren Benton]
Yah yah yah yah
I'm feeling like I'm out of it
I done turned into an alcoholic, and my mama ain't too proud of it
I'm outta my brain like it has revolving doors
I walk off, I've gone to whores
I get love in Atlanta, over to Baltimore
I get drunk and to the point that I can't walk no more
My nigga, yellin' "Jarren get up off the floor"
Goddamn it, I can't wait to get back home from tour!
I get back home
And thing's all wrong
And not knowing it was bad all along
My baby mama threw the deuces, she said "Nigga I'm gone"
She threw my shit up on the curb, I gotta call top wr-wr-wr-wr-wrong
How did I become such an embarrassment
I take a couple days off, just like Ferris did
Yah, R.I.P my brain cells are perishing
Somebody get a preacher and a therapist

[Hook:]
Outta my brain, I'm going out of my brain
Outta my brain, you best get out my way
Spend my days wondering if I'm okay
Cause I'm outta my brain
