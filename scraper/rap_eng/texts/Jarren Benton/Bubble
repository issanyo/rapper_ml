[Hook: Rock City]
Get fresh 7 days of the week and
Live life everyday as the weekend
That's what we call, call bubbling
Call, call bubble, call, call, call bubbling
Make getting money look so easy
I don't know about you but we eatin'
That's what we call, call bubbling
Call, call bubble, call, call, call bubbling

[Verse 1: Jarren Benton]
Pay attention ladies and gents, it's Jarren Bent
Remember waking up nights feeling like I was shit
Feeling inadequate
Couldn't bring home the bacon
Baby mama bitching
The bread wasn't bakin'
Like a retired doctor I had no patience
Lord show me a sign cause I am sick of waitin'
I'm anticipatin' to get out the situation
Feel like I'm living in hell right next to Satan
Wait, wait, oh, woah, no, this can't be life
All the struggle, all the pain, no this can't be right
It's when I start believing in me
Like a bird soaring through the sky I'm feeling so free

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Jarren Benton]
What don't kill me only makes me stronger
Baby I'm a motherfucking east side monster
Beast in this game, you can hear his hunger
Growl in his stomach, I came from down under
I do this for Gia
[?] America's nightmare
Family counting on me, I'll be right there
Can't lose
Can't snooze
Greedy like two Jews
Nieces, nephews
Jarren to the rescue
I'm special
If you hating on me, God bless you
I hex you
Negative energy couldn't pierce through
Coming soon to a record store near you
Light years past y'all, looking out my rear view
I'm bubbling

[Hook]
