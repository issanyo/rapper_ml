Party, drink, and smoke

[Verse 1: Jarren Benton]
Mix the juice and the vodka, I do this for the Rasta
Hit the after hour nigga still wildin', got the whores en mi casa
Her head game strong lay ya back and she gon' give a lobotomy
Back that ass up and drop it girl do it for Flux Pavilion and Doctor P

[Hook: Jarren Benton]
Rollin' and smokin' and mixin' and pourin'
We up in this bitch til like six in the morning
We up on them drugs we gon' fuck up the club
My high comin' down please don't fuck up my buzz
I can't feel my face like I think I'm not breathing
We still goin' up why the fuck is you sleeping?
We work hard and play hard and did enough reason

Party, drink, and smoke
Party...
Party, drink, smoke, smoke, smoke, smoke

[Verse 2: Jarren Benton]
Yeah, I'm so high in this bitch I don't know all the drugs I'm on
We just come here to party we still goin' hard, doin' shots we ain't goin' home
On the search for a bad bitch, sorry we had no future
I just want out [?] the duces then call her an Uber

[Hook: Jarren Benton]
We rollin' and smokin' and mixin' and pourin'
We up in this bitch til like six in the morning
We up on them drugs we gon' fuck up the club
My high comin' down please don't fuck up my buzz
I can't feel my face like I think I'm not breathing
We still goin' up why the fuck is you sleeping?
We work hard and play hard and did enough reason
I had an all week I can't wait for the weekend
