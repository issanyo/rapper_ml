[Verse 1: Jarren Benton]
Yeah Jarren Benton nigga
Nigga this hard work, hard work
My grandma taught me, "Put God first."
And these fuck niggas in my neck of the woods
They wouldn't show me love, I spit a hard verse
You feel the pain inside of my art, worst
So much failure, felt like my heart burst
I came to eat, fuck the horderves
The bully's home, I'm on all the nerves
So where the fuck were you when I was hurting?
Success was looking so uncertain
I couldn't afford a fucking christmas day for my daughter
Nigga I was worthless
Like God what the fuck is my purpose?
Stressing make a nigga feel nervous
I wash away the pain, no detergent
I'mma hit it with the motherfucking bourbon
So fuck you and your lame ass comments nigga
You don't know me from a fricking comment nigga
I'm going hard for my nigga Slow, rest in peace
I'm drinking till I vomit liquor
I'mma get richer, I'mma die trying, I'mma die grinding
Kill yourself with a hot iron if you hating nigga
I'm about mine, on Cloud Nine like Jesus nigga
I'm jet skiing on the English river
Counting paper till my fingers shiver
Down Grey Goose like I don't need a liver
Beat it nigga, I'mma chase the rest, cause I ain't high enough
I'm going in till my time is up
But if you think this shit just happened over night
And we ain't paying dues then you blind as fuck

[Hook: Locksmith]
I believe in me, I believe in me
Success is all I see, man it's all I see
I believe in me, I believe in me
Success is all I see, man it's all on me
Me, me, me, me
Ain't tripping off none of these niggas, it's all about
Me, me, me, me
Ain't tripping off none of these bitches, they choosing on
Me, me, me, me
Ain't tripping off what they be saying, they waiting on
Me, me, me, me
My future is all that I see, sheesh

[Verse 2: Locksmith]
Yeah and I pray to God as my witness
See I've harbored a sickness
I see life as it is
More than just money, cars and some bitches
I put fright in my peers, so it might come off as auspicious
Such delight when I veered, it was all a conscious decision
Never been a path I would take but mine
Dealing with the past is a waste of time
Nothing you remask can replace what's dying
Whether you adapt, it's a state of mind
Whether you react like a faceless mime
Put it on your back and embrace, I tried
Never been a nigga with a limited vision
I had a mission, I was fishing, but I ain't confined
Fucked in the game would've lost my footing
Things that I did seem so off putting
Had to learn quick if you wanna earn it
Then you have to let go, anyway, that's pulling
Sake for the friends and the hoes you fucked
Till it sinks in, then it slows you up
Whether you're embedded or forget it, you indebted
You can never tell when it's so abrupt
People be talking, the evil is scoffing
With me in the coffin, I meet with them often
I see what they causing, I leave 'em in caution
I know that they want to keep me in the margin
I'm paying no mind, cause their mind is corrupt
I divided it up, have no time to discuss
See? I never been trapped by a label
So why would I label my music?
You blinded as fuck, see?

[Hook: Locksmith]
I believe in me, I believe in me
Success is all I see, man, it's all I see
I believe in me, I believe in me
Success is all I see, man, it's all on me
Me, me, me, me
Ain't tripping off none of these niggas, it's all about
Me, me, me, me
Ain't tripping off none of these bitches, they choosing on
Me, me, me, me
Ain't tripping off what they be saying, they waiting on
Me, me, me, me
My future is all that I see, sheesh

[Verse 3: Futuristic]
I came in the game and I'm making a lane
My friends acting strange and they saying I changed
The fame that you claim is perception
[?] that's reckless, progression is what I maintain
I remade the name that they bang in my state
Then I moved to LA, oh my God, they can't wait
To act like they running a city
Without me, when you in a place only I can create
My girlfriend, I left her, I'm missing her face
But how can you cope with this amount of space
She knows all these bitches is after this nigga
She's so insecure, I can't help with the pain
She know that I'm making this money
I could fly her out, but I bought me a chain
And bought me a whip and bought me a studio
Swear that my next album gon' be insane, sheesh
I believe in me and that's all I believe
I got tunnel vision, promised success is all that I see
I know that I can be anything and that's all I'mma be
Seven shows in seven states and I did it all in a week
You weak, sending emojis with winks
I'm laughing cause you can't compete, don't speak
All things you don't know, I've been 'round the globe
And you barely been on the street, I'm trying to eat
Go Micky D's when I tell you I'm trying to double my cheese
If you think you fucking me, I'm like a black girl
All I say is "Nigga please."
