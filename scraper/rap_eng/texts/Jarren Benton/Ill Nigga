[Verse 1: Jarren Benton]
Illest nigga breathin' oxygen
Bitches injectin' Collagen
And got the nerve to tell me she ain't swallowin?
Bitch please... errggh
Your favorite rapper's a pipsqueak
Dumb as a sack of bricks, i met the bitch in Poughkeepsie
My kicks be, fly shit
Duck when the [?] speak
Overthrow the government they rulin' with an iron fist
Heavy concentrated strains created by a scientist
Foot so far up in your ass i need me a podiatrist
Nuttin' but fire shit, when Dirty Art Club is providin' it-
We ill nigga...
Huh

[Hook]
Tell yo mama we fuckin' ill nigga
Nuttin' but the fire shit, Dirty Art is prividin' it
We ill nigga...
Tell yo sister we fuckin ill nigga..

[Verse #2: Jarren Benton]
Uh, Yeah
Shout out to Asian niggas that don't like to use chopsticks
So fuckin high feel like i fell out the cockpit
You pussy, hide behind computers and pop shit
Preposterous, your sister got a neck like an ostrich
God body bury my body in a sarcophagus
Illest nigga walkin', you whack, you the fuckin' opposite
I bringin' back wallabies, her pussy smell like cottage cheese
Get this bitch some dick and hit that box with some Febreeze
I told you bastards I'ma rare nigga
Click clack pow, my pistol got a Hare Trigger
Pull your bitch's track somebody get some hair witchya

[Hook]
