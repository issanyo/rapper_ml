[Verse 1: Jarren Benton]
2 Years since my nigga died
1 year since a nigga cried
My whole team switch sides
Never trust a bitch, right
These niggas ain't loyal no more
Money turn these niggas into hoes
I just bought a pistol for my foes
I just put a new drug in my nose
New deal but we still independent
I ain't seen my my momma in a minute
Shit, I ain't seen my daddy in some years
I've been so focused on my career
All these rappers sounding so robotic
I done turned in to an alcoholic
This industry's so fucking diabolic
Lately I've been feeling so psychotic
Where were you when I was contemplating suicide?
Now I'm [?] any nigga getting euthanized
Lately I've been dancing with the devil
Money make a nigga feel special
I feel like my brain is all gone
I've been on the road too long
I pray that my kids stay strong
One more drink and hope the pain stay gone

[Hook: Sareena Dominguez]
Am I, losing my mind now?
Dark nights, money, and new towns
How am I supposed to know, who's my friend and who's my foe?
Bright lights, faces I don't know
Drug highs, reflections and long roads
How am I supposed to know, if you'll stay or if you'll go?

[Verse 2: Jarren Benton]
Yeah bitch I know I got trust issues
That's what makes it hard for me to fuck with you
Fuck Cupid, love will break a niggas heart
Take a good girl and turn that bitch dark
These niggas got more friendlier with Lucifer
Funny what a little fame'll do to ya
Lately I've been trying to keep my circle small
Right before the show we sniffing adderall
Right before the show we chugging alcohol
Record make the bitches wanna drop their draws
They see I'm a star but blinded to my flaws
They gone throw that pussy at you after all
I hope that my life's still in Gods hands
Only way to overcome the odds fam
I ain't got no tolerance for nonsense
Lately I've been silencing my conscience
I wonder where the dead go
My nigga don't keep fucking with my head yo
I ain't took no time out to deal with pain
I'm out here just trying to eat this bread ho
More covered and it still fell off
I can see these pussy niggas still real soft
Oh my God this new life of mine but when I look into the mirror nigga still feel lost

[Hook: Sareena Dominguez]
Am I, losing my mind now?
Dark nights, money, and new towns
How am I supposed to know, who's my friend and who's my foe?
Bright lights, faces I don't know
Drug highs, reflections and long roads
How am I supposed to know, if you'll stay or if you'll go?

[Bridge: Jarren Benton]
I feel like I'm losing my fucking mind
I feel like I'm losing my fucking mind

[Hook: Sareena Dominguez]
Am I, losing my mind now?
Dark nights, money, and new towns
How am I supposed to know, who's my friend and who's my foe?
Bright lights, faces I don't know
Drug highs, reflections and long roads
How am I supposed to know, if you'll stay or if you'll go?
