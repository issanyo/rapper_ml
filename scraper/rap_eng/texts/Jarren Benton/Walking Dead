Verse 1 [Toasty]:

I'm a dead man walkin'
So I let the muthafuckas keep talkin'
Don't feel alive in my mind
Why do I have eyes when I'm blind?
I can hear the skies callin'
Bout to shoot some bulls and, I'm cool, and
Rising up, I'm fallin', and I'm haulin'
With this weight on my shoulders, I can wait till it's over
Bitch, I can end it and I think it's upholdin'
I'm the shadow in the dark you're afraid of
Play the game of, rip the blades off
I'll show you what I'm made of
Machete in my mouth as my teacher ripped the blade off
I'm an Adolph, droppin' bombs on these muthafuckas
Headphones on these muthafuckas, what's wrong with these muthafuckas?
Takin' notes every song like I'm wet in the game
So I belong to die sad and sing songs, muthafuckas
Take my advice, put that in a sex dream, bitch
Into your life, I drive straight when I write
Too much pain for the light, with a strange appetite
Blame me? You might, it's like a hurricane every night
Jarren in this bitch, so you know it's goin' hard
Leaving every inch on your fuckin' body scarred
You feel the pinch deep within your skin
Watch the illness kick in, I'm the sickness goin' large
Zombie, I'm so ill that you want me
I won't lie, bitch, I am afraid
Cause of my fucked up past and mistakes I made
It drives me insane, I can't wait for fame
One day, all of you punks will stop laughing
One day, you might just feel like crying
So bitch, don't ever fuckin' say to me that I'm wasting my time
I'll stick a knife in your spine


Hook [Toasty]:

I'm walking dead [x3]
No thought can heal this
I'm walking dead [x3]

Verse 2 [Jarren Benton]:

Yah (J-J-J-Jarren..BEN-TON!)
Buenos dias, never throw a fetus in ya senorita
Crocodile skin on my Adidas, I beat the pussy, leave it paraplegic
I eat everything, everything, YEAH BITCH I eat up everything!
And it's so loud, you smell it through this hella fame
We throwin' pussy niggas off the airplane
Gold trim on these Paraframes
My DNA is on the verowayne
Got a blood bitch that lovin' smellin' paint
My nigga did 5 for sellin' 'Cane
East Side in this muhfucka
Come play with these bloodsuckers
Reign so nice, I'll friggin' lace yo guns
If y'all want beef like fuh-muckas
Smokin' Ether till I'm in a seizure
I put my sneakers up the fuckin' keister
Bumpin' Black Sabbath till I bust the speakers
She let me cut her with no anesthesia
Haters blow me like a Dandelion
I'm out my mind like Amanda Bynes
Tony Stark's, I keep my hands on eyes
So don't cross me nigga, unless you play on dyin'
(PAH-PAH) Put 'em in a morgue
Dig a bigger ditch, I'll put the nigga in a forest
Neighborhood smellin' like a fuckin' rigor mortis
Benton on the baby, yeah, that beat has been aborted
My dope boy said that his boy got deported
Rappers ain't real, I bet that nigga get distorted
Hoes done arose, I got my feet like a forest
But my killas walkin' dead, I'll let my nigga sing the chorus
AAAAHH!
