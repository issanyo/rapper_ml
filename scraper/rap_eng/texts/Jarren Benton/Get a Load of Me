[Verse 1]
Good morning bitches, Jarren's here
I'm 'bout to give the game a douche and a manicure
Crack open a can of beer
Bitch I'm the man in here
Blowin' green in the air like Captain Planet and Planeteers
I'm not a human I'm the reaper in the flesh
Here to feed you ether, I'll eat you and beat you 'til your death
Smokin' reefer and fuckin' disgusting skeezers
This bitch won't leave me alone, cause I told her I'm Justin Bieber
Your a freakin' fever I'm hot as a gas stove
This is for retards, geeks and assholes
I'm pickin' apart things turn rappers to sardines
Shootin' at the radio, Megatron and Starscream
Stabbin' niggas brains with sharp things
I'm a monster, dragon lungs and sharp fangs
Bingin' on beats and puking like bulimics
Heres a picture of my brain tell me have you niggas seen it

[Hook]
They hear us knockin' but won't let us in
Hey tell them bitches Jarren's back for revenge
And get a load of me now
They just shit on me piss on me spit on my grave
Laugh behind my back but in my face get a load of me now

[Verse 2]
Yes, life's great, fuck yours, your whole clique a bunch of lames, up yours
When I was 15 I told my mom fuck chores
I rather run the streets smoke weed and hump whores
Chuggin' PBRs, screw Bud Light Beer
I'm high as the rocket pack in back of Buzz Lightyear
I kill a rapper, puke get squeemish and run
What's been hot to the man that exstinguished the sun
Uh, can't distinguish what planet I'm from
I got a date with your mom and I'm plannin' to cum
Whores get branished and hung
You tuck your dick between your legs, panic and run
I just left the studio and I planted a bomb
Pass me the anal lube and hand me that gun
Eat shit and die, that's what I tell a dork
So what the fuck's a Maybach to a nigga that can teleport

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Good night bitches, Jarren's back
I'm here to give the game a motherfuckin' heart attack
Rappers are Garbage Pail, I spit it hard as hell
What's this blue shit in my pot, nigga I'm Gargamel
This is Decatur rap took to difibulators
Fuckin' idiot shovin' whores in refrigerators
We innovators just watch how they finna hate us
Jedi Mind Tricks like Vinnie Paz and Darth Vader
If you ain't bullet proof, duck when the gun pop
Niggas love Jarren like liquor stores and pawn shops
Lost one of the illest spitters, the night that Pun dropped
Now Jarrens a beast, I'm coming to feast and damn it I won't stop
Uh, I'm a motherfuckin' animal
Saber tooth tiger I'm splittin' your fuckin' cantolope
I make sure you haters don't come back
Have your town full of ghosts like a proton pack

[Hook]
