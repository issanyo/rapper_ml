[Verse 1: Jarren Benton]
I punch pussies, fuck sluts, and rob faggots
Pop pills with Uncle Phil and Bob Saget
Sneak [?] inside movies through Rob's jacket
Cut classes to fist whores with small asses
The glue huffer
The used rubber
Your mom stuck up her
'Fore we hit the meth and a few uppers
I cut a ear off cause I ain't feeling y'all
You the cum that's sprayed on Jake Gyllenhaal
I stay billin' all
You squat in cars
You jocking balls like a homo
Can't stand po-po
Only fuck with Spittz, if he dies I'm solo
Obi Wan Kanobi, the Beatgods logo
Haters like "oh no!"
Chuck Norris  dojo
Karate chop a nigga for stealing my mojo
Bitch, take a photo
It'll last longer
Two Cialis pills
My dick is mad stronger
The go realer
The ho stealer
Even white supremacists, they cheer for me
They like "go nigga!"
Watch for them hip-hop robots
It's 6 o'clock, I'm out, your mom's cooking stove-top

[Verse 2: 4ize]
The stove-top cooker
The hookup on your hooker hooker
The buy my CD and get one for free over-looker
The clean
Vigilante
Machine
Origin born with a skeleton, a wolverine
Rap's a [?]
This I command
Lord, a war with military contraband
In Chi-Town
I park the Hummer in an alley
Cause niggas hold guns like the governor of Cali
So I have to find her
And get to her
Before they kill her
My bullets are silver
They bust when I murk werewolves and vampires
4ize throwing snake heads in the campfires
The coup de gras
The lyrical, super ritual
Yeah, cause mercy's for the weak and the pitiful
I give [?] to the devils and the demons
When I loathe the wretchedness of these heathens
And choke on the foul stench of the wickedness
Behold the wrath of God unlimitless
Did rain down fire and brimstone
Weapons of mass destruction in my Sprint phone
