[Hook: Sareena Dominguez]
Time is tickin', yeah, it's tickin' away
I waited all my life to say
My misery hates company
I'm at a loss for words, that's a first for me
Silence is golden
Go through the motions
Silence is golden
The same color that my throne is

[Verse 1: Jarren Benton]
Yeah, damn, can't believe that my homeboy dead
I still feel shocked like I'm shot in the head
I woke up and cried 'til my eyes turned red
I wish it was a nightmare that I just had
The coroner just put my nigga in a bodybag
And his mama turned away cause she cannot witness that
And I ain't know what to say when I was standin' with your dad
Only thing that I could think was, "Goddamn, this is sad"
Man, we was just laughin' on the weekend
That was your goodbye, guess it just sinked in
No words that I can jot with the ink pen
To describe the way I feel, I guess I'm still grievin'
I wish that I could bring my nigga back
He ain't even know how much he meant to me and that was wack
That I couldn't even express it 'til he layin' on his back
At his fuckin' funeral when I ain't know how to react
Yeah, we supposed to get rich together
God had another plan for you that was better
I send a prayer to your mama and your whole family
Rest in peace, dog, you my homeboy forever
Yeah, I know you livin' in the sky
I wish I had a better way to tell my nigga "Bye"
Make sure you cherish every moment that you spend with your people cause you never know tomorrow they could die
Uh, you believed in me homie, yeah, and for that I thank you
I know you're in a better place, probably up in heaven, crackin' jokes with them angels
Never be forgotten as I'm writin' over violins
I feel alone like I'm on my own island
I think about my nigga every day like I'm at a loss for words as I drown in the silence

[Hook: Sareena Dominguez]
Time is tickin', yeah, it's tickin' away
I waited all my life to say
My misery hates company
I'm at a loss for words, that's a first for me
Silence is golden
Go through the motions
Silence is golden
The same color that my throne is

[Verse 2: Jarren Benton]
Yeah, damn, there we go, not speakin' again?
Out the front door a nigga leavin' again
I rode around the city pissed off about some bullshit you said
Make me feel like I ain't breathin' again
I get back, and we ain't talked to each other for like two days
Damn girl, who pissed in your Kool Aid?
I apologize a trillion times, make it a trillion-one, but this time I'm too late
Yeah, I guess you fed up with my shit
To get through that cold heart I need an ice pick
The look on your iris, so lifeless, remember them good times we had that was priceless?
Damn, did I fuck you up that bad?
You need space now, I guess I respect that
I'm tryna break through them walls that you put up
But I don't even know where your head at
Yeah, I guess I better let her fly away
It's hard to cope with the pain, I wanna die today
I'll find a fuckin' hideaway to hibernate
I sit and let this liquor wash the hurt like a tidal wave
And oh yeah, by the way
If I could take all the hurt back I'd find a way
I guess I'll pop another pill so I can sleep and let my brains cook
Like I put my head inside a microwave
Yeah, now I feel like a loser
I knew all the wrong I was doin', I would lose her
Now I see the light, amen, hallelujah
But I'm stuck in my shit like I sit in cow manure
World went crashin' when I lost my co-pilot
Ringin' in my head, somebody turn off the sirens
She ain't even talk to a nigga and it hurts so bad
Now all I do is drown in your silence

[Hook: Sareena Dominguez]
Time is tickin', yeah, it's tickin' away
I waited all my life to say
My misery hates company
I'm at a loss for words, that's a first for me
Silence is golden
Go through the motions
Silence is golden
The same color that my throne is
