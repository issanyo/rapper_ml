[Verse 1 - Jarren Benton]

My daddy threw the deuces at my momma, (Deuces)
Fuck em', now we going through some commas. (fuck em')
Pop a wheelie on the fucking Yokohama
When you're in water better watch for them piranha's
Gotta keep your hand on your llama, Hasta Ma√±ana
Nigga get to snitching like "that's him, your honor"
Brass Knuckle Benton bitch, dun dun danana!
Smelling like Dolce and Gabbana
A nigga still yelling out fuck 12
I was so low that I could touch hell
To sum it all up in a nutshell
Bitch I've been the shit since I had a high top and a ducktail
I beat the pussy up like I'm Rocky Marciano
Fresh out the ball, Alejandro, Alejandro
Eating good at Maggiano's load the pistol up with ammo
Shoot it a nigga make a scene in the soprano, (wooo!)
Lord have mercy on a nigga
Murcielago get to skirting on a nigga
Slow dead now pourin' bourbon for my nigga
A 9-5 just ain't working for a nigga
My daughter want an Iphone, son need a leap pad
About to rob a liquor store nigga in a ski mask
Fuck that now ride low with the seat back
Bad hoes give me love below like three stacks

[Hook]
I used to be hater like u, I used to be a hater like u (wooo!)
Now I got a lil' paper, too, I went and got a lil' paper too
Yamaha sitting up on one wheel, left the pussy nigga down on Stuntville
Nigga still going after 1 pill, one mill, two mill, a hundred mill

[Scotty ATL]

My momma threw the deuces at my daddy
And I was too young for a say so
Play ball, wanna be a rapper, everything you dream, end up in the streets for the peso
I ain't have a lot of beef but i stay with the [?]
Give me my Nacho like queso, nigga tough, can't say it in my face, though, no lunch but i got pay play though, fuck the fake hoes, see my daddy was player, got [?] i ain't got into some other shit, momma got tired of him saying fuck this shit, i been became a player too, no [?]
Hugging corners in the Chevy with the windows up and the AC on, with the [?] swerve on the bitch, coming for the crown, i'll take a motherfuckers couple crown too, niggas love then they turn around and down you, shit shake nigga fizzle like mountain dew
No red no [?] see a couple ya'll niggas trying do what i do, be you lil' nigga, let me do what I do, little feet can't fit in my shoes, bitch!

[Hook]
