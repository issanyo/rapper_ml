[Intro]
Yeah, feel I don't give a fuck no more
Feel like fuck everything, man
Fuck everybody
Fuck the social media shit
Fuck the TV
Fuck you

[Verse 1]
Fuck every nigga that dislike me, bougie bitches is feisty
Only fuck with niggas with large paper, that pussy pricey
Sleeping on these niggas with dreams
When that man blow, you only on his dick for the cream
You fucking slut
Fuck the Instagram thot that shake her ass every post
Attention craving bitches, all do the most
That pussy gross, do some soul searching
Your kids just asking for love
You hardly pay 'em any mind, you shake your ass at the club
Ayy, fuck them insecure lame niggas thinking they hard
He post his dirt on Facebook, pussy nigga, you fraud
Fuck that nigga that's twenty-five and just joined the gang
Never came from that environment, that nigga a lame
Fuck the house nigga that stand for nothing
Turned a blind eye on inequality, that's disgusting
Somebody snuff him
Fuck anybody that hate me 'cause the tone of my skin
Fuck stressing about this paper, gave a loan to my friend
Fuck the crooked systems, the overpopulated prisons
Classism and racism, fuck what's the difference?
Fuck the radio, 'cause they always play the same shit
Fuck some of you rap blogs, they always suck the same dicks
Fuck if you think better 'cause the college degrees you lack
Knowledge yourself, plus I make more gwap than you B
Fuck all the poverty and fathers that ran out on their kids
Them niggas cowards, I stopped harboring love for you, bitch

[Hook]
I wake up in the morning, cook my eggs on the stove
Feel my heart getting cold, no more love for you hoes
And I don't think about it, middle finger to the sky
Not another tear to cry, will I live or will I die?

I wake up in the morning, put my grits on the stove
Feel my heart getting cold, no more love for you hoes
And I don't think about it
Middle finger to the world like I don't give a fuck about it

[Verse 2]
Fuck your street credibility, niggas living out their negativity
'Cause they're insecure 'bout who they are
Fuck thinking it's cool to be a drug addict, that shit sucks
Drugs destroyed the black community, what sick fucks?
Put the crack in the hood like an experiment
Niggas turning zombies, was once creators of pyramids
I'm guilty of it too, I make songs like, "Lean"
Drop a drug reference on every other sixteen
So, fuck me and fuck anybody that disagree
And fuck the chains we put on our minds from being free
Fuck the presidents and politicians making us sheep
Look behind the sheet, my nigga, wake from out of your sleep
Ayy, fuck my sneaker fetish, could've put that money in my kid's savings
But I go and buy rims, clothes, expensive cravings
Fuck Funk Volume for splitting up
We had potential to be the illest label, no one was sick as us
I miss my niggas, I hope you all doing well
Now I own my own enterprise, nigga I will prevail
Fuck the OGs misleading the youth
Ayy, give 'em babies the truth
Half of that shit you spit is fake in the booth
Fuck fear, fuck doubt, fuck stressing myself out
'Cause I worry that they sleep when I know I'm the best out
Fuck stressing over love, women come, women go
Met my worst enemy staring in the mirror like, whoa

[Hook]
I wake up in the morning, cook my eggs on the stove
Feel my heart getting cold, no more love for you hoes
And I don't think about it, middle finger to the sky
Not another tear to cry, will I live or will I die?

I wake up in the morning, put my grits on the stove
Feel my heart getting cold, no more love for you hoes
And I don't think about it
Middle finger to the world like I don't give a fuck about it
