[Sample: Jarren Benton]
K-K-Kato on the track bitch

[Intro: Evans Desir]
Yeah, you better pray, yeah, you better pray
You better pray that we never collide
You better pray that we never collide
You better pray that we never collide

[Verse 1: Jarren Benton]
Yeah, I have no patience for none of the fuck shit
I am too rich for a bitch not to suck dick
Aye fuck all the talkin' the guap is the subject
Spent too much on strippers just fucked up my budget
All of my niggas addicted to drugs
Without all the filters that bitch is a dud
Aye you call her wifey but we call her slut
My niggas are savages we give no fucks
Took that bitch out the ghetto I showed her the finer things
And drop that bitch right back off at the ghetto
Frozen my bezel(?), I know that there's levels
These vices they'll kill you if you are not careful
They left me for dead now I'm right back on schedule
These broke niggas plottin' I slide back the metal
I came a long way bitch no I never settle
Got rifles for rivals and I have got several

[Pre-Chorus: Evans Desir]
I know you wanna ride like me
I know you want a life like me
Gassin' I'm gassin' I gassed her up
I think they mad that I passed 'em
I kill these niggas in fashion
I don't do talkin' I'm action
Know that I roll with the cash
Stay on the (?)

[Chorus: Evans Desir]
Yeah, look, you better pray that we never collide
I take yo bitch after I take yo life
Left me behind so I had to get right
Comin' for anyone left open wide
You better pray that we never collide

[Verse 2: Jarren Benton]
I have no trust for these niggas these days
Gotta lay low cause these bitches don't shave
I look in your eyes and I spit in your face
And right when you die I will piss on yo grave
I feel my heart getting colder each minute
The fuck out my throne man these niggas are finished
I feel like a king, bitch I think I'm a god
Been stressin' too much think I need a m√©nage
I see the snake and these niggas they slither
The foreign I whip it was sponsored by Hitler
Can call ways to switch ya, my niggas gon' kill ya
Forgot the bitch face but that pussy familiar
These rappers will kill ya they dressin' all weird and
These niggas get bodied then dragged in the river
I spot my worst enemy right in the mirror
Allergic to fuck niggas why are you near us!

[Chorus: Evans Desir]
I know you wanna ride like me
I know you want a life like me
Gassin' I'm gassin' I gassed her up
I think they mad that I passed 'em
I kill these niggas in fashion
I don't do talkin' I'm action
Know that I roll with the cash
[?]

[Chorus 2: Evans Desir]
Yeah, look, you better pray that we never collide
I take yo bitch after I take yo life
Left me behind so I had to get right
Comin' for anyone left open wide
You better pray that we never collide

[Beat Switch]

[Outro: Evans Desir]
If you broke nigga know I could never be you
Married to the money you remember I do
Yeah, up in the sky I feel like a god
Yeah, look, you better pray that we never collide
You better pray that we never collide
