[Hook: WHATEVER WE ARE]
I don't fuck with you or your town
Voices in my head going wild
Push me to my edge and I die
Y'all gon' test me or not, y'all gon' test me or not

[Verse 1: Jarren Benton]
Fuck 'em all, fuck 'em all
I hear them talking in the halls
They making fun of all my flaws
I feel so alone and lost
God I hate this fucking school, who made these fucking rules
Swear that this ain't cool, and all this fucking pressure what is there to prove
And I am so confused, and I am finna lose it
I might flip and OOHH!
Probably hurt someone
Plus the shit that I get from my mom back at home makes the perfect storm
Only thing to bring calm is the percs I'm on
Hide the way that I feel play the perfect son
When she sleep I take cash out her purse and run and go buy drugs everything just to blow up numb
Now it's back up to school with the jocks I don't get it
Pretentious bitches mind your business
I hear your whispers and your disses
They call me weird bitch I'm a misfit
The homie just passed away
And I can't do class today
I'd rather get smashed astray
From this place stuck in hell all these bastards fake
One more kid call me weird I'ma bash his face
All this pain, I might turn to a basket case
I don't fit in so our peers can hate
Where the fuck is the God I just ask for faith
These voices in my head, they force me to the edge
And I am not prepared to make it through the day
To many tears i've shed, these stresses got me scared
It's best if I was dead
My dad ask about my day, I lie and say it was great
He don't know all the shit I take, I just suppress then get high then I drift away
I lock myself in my room catch a wave of the tune, of my favorite rapper then I gaze at the moon
I dreamt tomorrow shifted, day was a doom
Pray I'm left alone and maybe shit'll be cool man
But fuck it, uh
I sit here sad for what
Sick of being here mad as fuck, I steal the gun from my dad then I pack it up
Off to school with the tool, I don't brag or bluff
Fuck around they don't know that the strap is tucked
This for all of the times that they laughed at us
I pull out the gun out the bag, think I've had enough
I tell 'em

[Hook: WHATEVER WE ARE]
I don't fuck with you or your town
Voices in my head going wild
Push me to my edge and I die
Y'all gon' test me or not, y'all gon' test me or not

[Bridge: WHATEVER WE ARE]
Pull up on a kid one time and I drop ya like an 808
Pull up on a kid one time and I drop ya like an 808
Pull up on a kid one time and I drop ya like an 808
Pull up on a kid one time and I drop ya like an 808

[Hook: WHATEVER WE ARE]
I don't fuck with you or your town
Voices in my head going wild
Push me to my edge and I die
Y'all gon' test me or not, y'all gon' test me or not

[Bridge: WHATEVER WE ARE]
Pull up on a kid one time and I drop ya like an 808
Pull up on a kid one time and I drop ya like an 808
Pull up on a kid one time and I drop ya like an 808
Pull up on a kid one time and I drop ya like an 808
