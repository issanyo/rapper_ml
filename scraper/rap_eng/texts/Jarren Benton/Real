[Hook: Sincerely Collins]
Real
We gon’ bring that real back
We gon’ bring that feel back
Yeah I know you feel that
Real
So tell me how you like this
Baby don’t you fight this
They wanna get like this
Real
And I don’t want to waste it
I’m not into basic
I would rather chase this
Real
And we won’t let it fade
Live another day
Please respect the game
And that’s that real

[Verse 1: Sincerely Collins]
I’m stuck between a rock and a hard place
Hardships lead to heartache
Hard dick for the shawtys
The only ones that I partake in then I skrt
Nigga parlay them all day, nigga so Kanye
Nigga ducks in a row like I’m coach bombay nigga
You say I’m wack, I’ma say hardly nigga
Fly like an eagle with your subpar ways nigga
I remember I was just like you
I was just like you, I was just like you nigga
And I learned if I just fight through nigga
Ain’t no telling what I just might do nigga
We do not have to be enemies, peace and serenity
Can’t we just all get along?
They throw us in a cage and they fill us up with hate
So fighting’s the only way a nigga really feel strong
So these hoes caught up, and these niggas tell lies
And the only way to know if it’s really that real is if you look ‘em in the eyes
Hallelujah, praise god, that’s real

[Hook: Sincerely Collins]
Real
We gon’ bring that real back
We gon’ bring that feel back
Yeah I know you feel that
Real
So tell me how you like this
Baby don’t you fight this
They wanna get like this
Real
And I don’t want to waste it
I’m not into basic
I would rather chase this
Real
And we won’t let it fade
Live another day
Please respect the game
And that’s that real

[Verse 2: Jarren Benton]
Yeah, rest in peace to the real niggas
Throw the deuces at them hoes, I couldn’t deal with ya
Wash the pain with the steel liquor
Ain’t no sunshine word to bill [?], always been an ill nigga
Live from a fucked up environment
Mama fucked the money up, enough for her retirement
Made it out the habitat, still was uninspiring
I was at my lowest and my shit was steady spiraling
Out of control and starting to go
Middle finger to all of my foes
I’m tryna get this bitch out of her clothes
But I’m too drunk to get my head out the camo
Lord have mercy on all of our souls
I need Doctor Phil, Jesus Christ and a pot of pills
I helped my grandma pay her doctor bills
And pray her sickness disappear just like [?]
[?] tryna cop a feel
I tell the bitch that we can kick it like a soccer field
I’m just tryna get some top and drill
Yeah ho, you know the fucking deal
You a build-a-bitch, you not for real
We came a long way from cotton fields and cotton mills
Watch how the weak niggas see the cops and squeal
Damn, but really I’m no better than you
I’m living life and I’m scared of it too
Nigga I’m just being real

[Hook: Sincerely Collins]
Real
We gon’ bring that real back
We gon’ bring that feel back
Yeah I know you feel that
Real
So tell me how you like this
Baby don’t you fight this
They wanna get like this
Real
And I don’t want to waste it
I’m not into basic
I would rather chase this
Real
And we won’t let it fade
Live another day
Please respect the game
And that’s that real

[Verse 3: Sean Rose]
Still the one they checking for
Still the one they asking ‘bout
They asking where a nigga went
Tell ‘em that I took the paper route
Had to ask a couple bitches out
Had to leave a couple niggas out
Some details I’m probably leaving out
How, high in back of my mama’s house
How, how my BM tryna sell me out
Damn, why my best friend talkin’ ‘bout me on the gram
What I been through, you don’t even understand
What I been through
Ex’s sending texts that they miss you
Regretting everything with you
And how they just can’t get you off of they mental
Tell ‘em oh well, they in love with the old him
This is 2016 Sean Rose, it’s the new me
I ain’t here to take no L’s

[Hook: Sincerely Collins]
Real
We gon’ bring that real back
We gon’ bring that feel back
Yeah I know you feel that
Real
So tell me how you like this
Baby don’t you fight this
They wanna get like this
Real
And I don’t want to waste it
I’m not into basic
I would rather chase this
