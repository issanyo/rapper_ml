[Antimatter]
I'm way to smooth on the motherfucking entrance
Stick n move
I'm old school by intention
Move like a henchman
Yes i demand your life
When enter your demise
With the dead blank eyes
Ima get em
Hurry let me at em
Like a fanatical
Looking for a battle
You wanna battle the beast
You need the mathematical brain
I subtract remains so how can you gain?
Let me, give you the insight
The guidance
Mentor the fighters
Enter the final stages
With a method its effort less
I'm just dangerous
Examine what you got remaining
Majored in the arts of decapitating
Wanna face it
Face what
The hazardous
Fucking ravenous
Madness
Cold cat
Leaving gashes
Up and down your as quick
The chemical weapon attack like Damascus
I mash shit
Its the father
Messiah
Only one higher
Making a mass amount of miracles spitting fire
Breathe in the LPG exhale in the range of a lighter
I'm just in love with danger
Bow to one knee
And put the ring on her finger

[M.Sith]
Show me your chelsea grin
1,2,3, go

[Matuse]
Covered in bones and roses
Smothered in hoes with toes
Red nosed like roses
Cut off these foes and posers
Poke holes in their coats and clothes and loafers
Smoke the dro enclosed in closures
Hold the door, we got more to show ya
Slow ya roll if ya'll don't know we flow for dough
But fight the foe with only one eye open
Notice the cobra on doujah or sober
Those that oppose us or wanna control us
Know that they owe us much more than they show us
Hold up we roll up and show em we loaded
Focus on moments of potent opponents
And those that oppose us
Will drown in the oceans
Hopeless like pharaoh who fought against Moses
The holders of boulders
The wrath of the locus
So its healthy then
For you to help me then
Grab their face and help me skin
A slim motherfucking Chelsea grin
On the faces of Corporate gangsters
World bankers
Elitist masons
Fanatical radical
Black flag waving
Coming in blazing destroying their sanctum

[hook]

[Jarren Benton]
Smile for the camera
Awaiting to damage ya
Beast mode nigga
I'm a motherfucking animal
I'm here to take everything you owe me
I'm going to crack your fucking mental
Like a cantaloup
Yeah bitch i got the antidote
I gotta get it, i can't stand to see the fam broke
So i load more ammo
Dressed up in camo
I get them while this niggas at the panel
POW throw brick through your lambo
AR15 on the mantel
On the hunt for a crocked politician
I'm a lead a nigga missing
With his face all dismantled
Chelsea Grin, Commando blade
You don't wanna see him
Might pop up and fuck up your whole weekend
His not breathing but his face bleeding
Fuck the world with a cold dick
You tried play us like we don't know shit
We hip to all your crooked ways
Anarchy nigga, lets go bitch
It's wire season, i'm focused
Sick of feeling so hopeless
I made a hit list for you fuckboys
This gun and knife is so ferocious

[bridge]

[N3]
I’m plugged back in the system, aiming for the core
Deadly virus of wisdom, running through your spinal chord
To erase your existence, in an instant
Carving your head thru the floor to Osiris’s kingdom
Then ill hunt you with the reapers scythe, in the afterlife
Hack your soul to pieces, to rest in eternal cries
Lucifer can't hold me down, I’m burning his crown
I’ll take on the underworld, in an infinite the battle round
Beastly roars, spitting at a calibre that will shatter your jaw, the gore is on your
Kings blood will pour, I’ll drink it yeah i’m madder than, than a vatican whore, who’s cunt stink of war
Smelling the doom, is that your perfume
Chocking on your chemical fumes, that i consume
Now my lungs are heating the room, when i breath thru
Blazing out the fire you fuel, I’ma ash you
Flaming these motherfuckers we smoking their banks n’ laughing
We chomp on their tax brackets on all you 1% we snaking
Time to feed the pack, these alphas have got my back
Tracking you through the blackness, n’ stacking the heads we hacking
Diggin’ in deep enough to, giving his ass a smile too
Fist the motherfucker makin’ a puppet i can rap thru
Singing n’ chanting voodoo, klaatu barada nikto
I’ma swallow you soul in my necronomic ritual

[hook]

[Jeff Turner]
Hey Chelsea, would you help me?
Get a couple motherfuckers that are wealthy
Been asking them to just help we
So sick and unhealthy
This a group pic, they taking selfies
About to hit an official right where their belt be
Nothing stays the same
Be wanna be change the wicked which melts him
Everyone like the same song
Everyone has the same phone
Try to speak up all they hear is ching chong
No one to put the blame on, so nigga game on
Its a phenomenon but still i shine, we grime and grind
We can't find the dime, it goes on and on
They've got a dime in mind
They like Neo
Their one, we're 99
It's opposite of equal
They wobble and weavel
Keeping poison in the hood
While their robbing the people
Massaging the zero's
Keeping us below
Posing as heroes
I'm a pedestrian saying let me in
Nigga where's my credit card
Give a nigga his Chelsea Grin
I'm a blue collar nigga with two dollars
And whose calling me for a new job, I get it
Couldn't get a proof or news spot, forget it
This making like a holocoust, two shots a minute
Sleeping on a futon, eating croutons
The weight upon my shoulders is like two tones of interest
Got a choice, a voice and a written
Niggas should have listen when 2Pac was spitting

[Chico Cas]
Here we go again, with the Chelsea Grin remix
Got a bunch of dirty politicians on my hit list
Witness, the meanest combination of the illest
Realest, fearless, but you better fear these
Crazy motherfuckers on the mic, we on
AntiMatter and from the Funk, its Jarren Benton
Jeff Turner make it burn'a, with Matuse from the Free
With me Chico Cas tha Chix and the viking N3
Yeah we Smacktown bitch, and we going strong
Coming straight from Down Under, where we hold the thrown
We represent the strong, that work all day long
Just put a bit of food up on the table, and struggle on
So we gotta get together, and calling out all groups
From Sydney to the States round up the troops
Like we gonna go to war, so better tie them boots
Head to major corporations and them dirty crooks
And we all bandana'd up, all had enough, all soldiered up
Taking all their money then we give it to the poor
Go wreck em up, go fuck em up, No stopping us
We ain't knocking, we just kicking in the door
Then we put a credit card in between your teeth
Put a little pressure on it, make it cut the lips
Coz ain't no politician competition to our vision
On a mission for collision with precision for commission
