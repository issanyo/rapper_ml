[Intro]
A Kato Production
Ayy, man, this right here
Ayy, this for all the people who got somebody naggin' at 'em
They won't shut the fuck up
Haters, baby momma's, niggas
Leggo

[Chorus]
I'm riding dirty in my Autobot
I'm doing doughnuts in the parking lot
I'm sipping Hangar 1 and I'm smoking pot
Bitch you 'bout to blow my high, cause you talk a lot!
What you tell that ho? Shut up bitch!
What you tell that ho? Shut up bitch!
What you tell that ho? Shut up bitch!
What you tell that ho? Shut up bitch!
What you tell that ho? Shut up bitch!
What you tell that ho? Shut up bitch!
What you tell that ho? Bitch you 'bout to blow my high

[Verse 1]
Riding in my Autobot, sipping Coke and Captain
Got bitches in my cabin, I'm gon' drug 'em up and shag 'em
Two shots and they out: Osama Bin Laden
Jacked up, back down from Mars and now my main bitch won't stop nagging
Daaamn! Shut up bitch, bddddrrrr, you're 'bout to get wet up bitch
All you do is nyah, nyah, nyah, nyah, nyah, and now I'm fed up bitch
I've been on the grind like all night long tryna get this bread up, bitch
All you do is shoot a nigga down, you're fucking my head up, bitch
Man, fuck that shit, I don't need that ho
In the kitchen with my nigga Kato whipping up that speaker dough
Flying down I-20, headed to that east side, blowing reefer smoke
And she won't shut up so I hit the radio and let the speakers blow
And I'm so wasted off these PBR's
Put a sock in it, bitch, come give a niggas dick that CPR
Now I'm just riding round and I'm getting it
They tell me shit, god damn it I'm grown bitch, I'm not tryna hear it, no

[Chorus]
I'm riding dirty in my Autobot
I'm doing doughnuts in the parking lot
I'm sipping Hangar 1 and I'm smoking pot
Bitch you 'bout to blow my high, cause you talk a lot!
What you tell that ho? Shut up bitch!
What you tell that ho? Shut up bitch!
What you tell that ho? Shut up bitch!
What you tell that ho? Shut up bitch!
What you tell that ho? Shut up bitch!
What you tell that ho? Shut up bitch!
What you tell that ho? Bitch you 'bout to blow my high

[Verse 2]
Riding in my Autobot, heading to Decatur
Money over bitches, they will not come before paper
Outfit tailored, new Chuck Taylors
Bitch I'm so fresh, I'm still in the incubator
My side ho tripping, every night she bitching
Bitch get in the kitchen, do the dishes, fry some chicken
Psych, I'm only kidding, "Jarren what you sniffing?
Every night you run your fucking mouth", I'm like "bitch zip it"
Cruising in my Autobot, I'm leaning to the side
But you keep popping that shit girl, running your lips and blowing my high
Kato on the track, get a hit of this crack, that shit so fye
Every time you wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, I'm losing my mind!
It ain't like I like that bitch, I just want my life back bitch
Damn you so annoying, swear to God I wanna fight that bitch
Left her on the highway and I told her "I'll be right back bitch"
I should throw the deuces 'fore I turn around and Ike that bitch!

[Chorus]
I'm riding dirty in my Autobot
I'm doing doughnuts in the parking lot
I'm sipping Hangar 1 and I'm smoking pot
Bitch you 'bout to blow my high, cause you talk a lot!
What you tell that ho? Shut up bitch!
What you tell that ho? Shut up bitch!
What you tell that ho? Shut up bitch!
What you tell that ho? Shut up bitch!
What you tell that ho? Shut up bitch!
What you tell that ho? Shut up bitch!
What you tell that ho? Bitch you 'bout to blow my high
