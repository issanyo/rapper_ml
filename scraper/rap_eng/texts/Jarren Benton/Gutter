[Chorus: Emilio Rojas]
Yeah I'm from the gutter
You know we keep it gutter
My people from the gutter
We leave you in a gutter

[Verse 1: Emilio Rojas]
Everything in my momma name because I ain't trustin' one soul, nah
All them girls they won't fuck me, that's why all them hoes at my show, yeah
All them homies get hustlin' when they money start to get low
And I got my neck tatted and my head shaved like a convict on parole, yeah
I'm in uptown but we runnin' shit down to Ebbets Field
And them kids sleepin' on Fentanyl like it's Benadryl
We in the opioid epidemic, yeah everyone usin' dope
It's paralyzin' the paramedics, yeah everyone losin' hope
I got a cousin that overdosed, I got a friend who got clean
I got some people that started on Percocets after surgery, turned into fiends
I got a shorty that had some withdrawals in my crib and I found 20 pills in the jeans
But I didn't judge her, I just took it from her and told her that she couldn't leave, nah
This the American Dream, yeah, this is our fuckin' allure, yeah
They makin' us sick and feedin' us this shit, and sellin' us drugs as a cure, yeah
And they just target the poor, yeah lock us and take us to court, yeah
Send us to public defender because it's the only shit that we can afford, yeah

[Chorus: Emilio Rojas]
Yeah I'm from the gutter
You know we keep it gutter
My people from the gutter
We leave you in a gutter

[Verse 2: Jarren Benton]
I came out the gutter hoe, big guns that'll kill a buffalo
Momma can't even pay the gas bill (uh-uh)
Now we all huddled by the oven door (facts)
Cops shoot niggas over skin-tone
Daddy on crack nigga been gone (fuck 'em)
Broken home, black nigga syndrome, gang gang, nigga don't live long
Livin' in the gutter

[Verse 3: Price]
Rice with the butter
Daddy in jail, now his name is a number
The homie got killed, niggas tripped all summer
I was on tour tryna make a way out
Hefty got killed with his son in the city
12 shot Terrell, it went dumb in the city
She fucked the homie, thought she was the one in the city
I.e. there ain't no fun in my city
It's the gutter

[Verse 4: Oktane]
Yeah, livin' in the gutter
We ain't know we was in it
My neighbors ain't speak no English
Another ride in school, we ditchin'
Had the game and snacks in the kitchen
Don't talk, my friends don't listen
Ain't showin' up to no class, ain't showin' up to detention
I stayed up out that bullshit, still had to watch a homie get his brains blown
Still had to get slammed by the police, no bread so a nigga had to stay home
Wrong side of the hood, don't take long
Stay black, stay strong
Bring back my change and share with your brother
'Cause yeah

[Chorus: Emilio Rojas]
Yeah I'm from the gutter
You know we keep it gutter
My people from the gutter
We leave you in a gutter

[Verse 5: Dizzy Wright & Reezy]
Aye, woke up, took my chances
Trappin' takes no campin' (trap)
Momma kept on spendin'
Rode up mine and his man
Stackin' up the cheese, hold the mozzarella (uh-huh)
Came out the gutter like Donatello (gutter)
Now y'all movin' too slow (god damn)
Drag race, get it off the go, (skrrt, skrrt)
Pulled up in it, with the doors up (doors up)
Where the hoes at? What's the hold up? (hold up)
Pineal gland like a Cobra (like what?)
Pulled up, still hold 'em all up
We don't fold or fold over (not at all)
Me and money gettin' older (cash)
Put the city on my shoulders (I did)
Then I swear the world got colder
(Livin' in the gutter)

[Verse 6: Demrick]
Gutter raised with them gutter ways
Mother stand out the shutters
Watchin' as her sons would play, but on the other paved
Soon she looked away, we was servin' caine
Harsh realities of the real life, killin' off each other didn't feel right
Gotta watch for the red and the blue lights
Don't get caught runnin' 'round after midnight
I'm from the gutter
