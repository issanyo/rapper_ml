[Hook]
Yeah, I'm on my gasoline shit now
So hot, burn the motherfucking house down
Nah baby, I'm an animal
Eat beats in the booth, I'm Hannibal
Yeah, the east side cannibal
Strike a match, my nigga I'm flammable
I'm so (fire)
I spit (fire)
I am (fire)
You're not (fire)

[Verse 1]
Hey yo I'm fresh like baking soda
Arm & Hammer
Pledge allegiance to the east side of Atlanta
Holy ape shit
Dude, I'm 'bout to go bananas
Make these lame niggas shit their pampers
The track need chemo
Erick Sermon gave the beat cancer
No average Joe, baby I'm Cobra Commander
Crack, rock, morphine, and heroin
Money seems promising
Hoes, they want to marry him
Paul bearer you pussy niggas, see I will bury them
Have them niggas swimming with whales in the aquarium
I'm moving up now
I was once very poor
Fire marshal, I start fires like Drew Barrymore
Bulletproof, we can't die, so don't shoot
Bringing hip-hop back like Bill and Ted's phone booth
And I'm-a rock until my life expire
Cause I'm (fire)
You're not (fire)

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Hey yo please call a fireman
Hot like a fire van
Fire extinguisher in the booth is a requirement
Brain needs rewiring
Fire at your environment
Resuscitate rappers and kill 'em so they can die again
Butane, octane, and nitrogen
All we need is a flame, yeah, and we go right on them
Hi kids, do you like violence?
Silence of the lambs, I murdered the mic again
Vodka and Vicodin
Fuck up my night again
Can't put my fire out
Better off just retiring
Yeah, Mr. Benton
Wild as the Taliban
Bomb in my right
Microphone in my other hand
Southern man climbing through his window like Brother Man
Doctor telling his mama "I'm sorry ma'am, we lost him"
Fuck it, we just tossed him
Nigga you a liar
You ain't (fire)
Said I'm on (fire)

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Hey yo, Spittz, knock his nozzle off
Yeah I'm a molotov
Put the flame to the rag, then go drop the bottle off
Y'all niggas all soft
Pray I never fall off
Swear them niggas pussy
Think the doctor cut their balls off
I'm weird like Bjork
Don't eat p-ork
On some other shit like I'm Malachi Z York
Sitting at the seashore
Playing on my keyboard
Married to the game but the bitch wants a divorce
It's about to heat up
I'm turning the beat up
Tell Lucifer kick back and put his feet up
All I got in this world: me and my Adidas
Open up the fridge with [?] I'm 'bout to eat up
You don't run shit, y'all goons paraplegic
Hang them by the feet, go call you an orthopedic
We so out of space
You geeks are so beneath us
Your mama should have swallowed
Too late to abort the fetus

[Hook]
