Yeah, it's like...

[Hook]
And they love it (x3)
Yeah
They in love with it (x3)
Yeah
And they love it (x3)
Yeah
They in love with it (x3)

[Verse 1]
A-T-Lien, East Side Cyborg
I am so high in the sky, like "hi, Lord!"
Rap game's dinosaur
I am such a carnivore
Cannibal, Hannibal, glutton, yeah I want more
Encore, unsure, Jarren's not-- okay
Interruptin' niggas on the stage like Kanye
Nights I felt hopeless, lonely as an orphan
Dude, if you sick well meet Dr. Kevorkian
Yeah I'm-a torture them, welcome to my horror show
Live life fast like there is no tomorrow yo
Hop into that hovercraft, yeah bitch we 'bout to go
Five seconds 'til detonatin' we are 'bout to...

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
I'm a mother freaking problem, haters speak about fightin' him
Cause their bitch gave me head twice like Leviathan
Kids, stay in school and eat your motherfuckin' vitamins
Jarren's on the guest list, who the hell invited him
On his own island baby it's no Gilligan
Popped out that grave like thriller, there's no killin' him
I am such a bully, nigga this is my millennium
They say that he sound like Andre 3K and Eminem
Give 'em something different with a side of cyanide
High as a kite in a shop with free WiFi
If you say "fuck me", pussy nigga it's likewise
Sayonara sucker, say goodnight to the bad guy

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Nigga this is suicide, hip-hop heart rot
Shawty said she's celibate, this is where the car stop
Long walk home, I am so in the zone
See you niggas in the future, I am never coming home
Nightmare on Elm Street, niggas sleeping on me, they dead
Been eating long enough, break bread
I'm-a break legs, kick ass, and take names
You rappers such a geek, like screech, you so lame
Bitch we want one thing
We smoking on that ugly green, call it swamp thing
Cash rules everything, Mr. Benton very strange
Nigga, this that Southern fried dope wrapped in cellophane

[Hook]
