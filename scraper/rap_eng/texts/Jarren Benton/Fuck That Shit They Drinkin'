[Intro: Jarren Benton]
Ladies and gentleman, thank you guys for bein' here tonight
You're now rockin' with the fuckin' best
And I wanna talk about these sucker ass niggas, in my city
They just copy off whatever other nigga do
He drinks this, you drink it
He wears this, you wear it
Bitches!

[Verse 1: Jarren Benton]
Hello young America, fuck wit' us, I bury ya
Dig you up, and drop yo' ass off in another area
Your bitch stop and stare at us
Haters, they don't care for us
I'm so fuckin' fly, you stand by me, you'll get Malaria
Jesus, these rappers actin' like bitches
Lezdinadardi the land of the ripe peaches
Let's play operation, this blade will cut 'em to pieces
Sew him back together, my God, he looks so ridiculous!
Uh, you can kiss my Chuck Taylor's bitch
Run on stage and snatch the mic from your ass, Taylor Swift!
Still rep Decatur bitch, like I am the mayor bitch
Bet I'm 'bout to blow, I told you I'm on the F. Cator shit!
Who's the next competitor? Okay, I'm a predator
I be up in Ecuador gettin' skulls like skeletor
Wake up next to horses head, and hoes I've never met before
If I say I'm a killer, I don't mean it, it's a metaphor!
Yeah, yeah, let's go!

[Hook: Jarren Benton]
Party like a white boy, fall out at the bar
We don't sip no Rosé, give me one more PBR
I say, fuck that shit they drinkin' on
Fuck that shit they drinkin' on
Fuck that shit they drinkin' on
Fuck that shit they drinkin' on!
Hangar One and Henny, all I need, just give plenty
I'm so slizzard off that Billy Dee, Ginger Ale, and Remy, man
Fuck that shit they drinkin' on
Fuck that shit they drinkin' on
Fuck that shit they drinkin' on
Fuck that shit they drinkin' on!

[Verse 2: Tom P.]
When I start the party, (yeah)
I don't just drink a beer (What)
I drink about fifty just to get a little buzz
Till; I'm sick and till the think ain't clear
Kick start, hoppin' on top of the tables
Hollerin', but he can't walk in a stable. (Woah)
Six shots plus a little bit of weed
Got my head spinnin' just like a Hanukkah dreidel
Tom, he been hot, hot since the cradle
An appetite, for what Maddie likes
Yo, what the fuck you drinkin' on?
Quick, kids, sip this, it's half the price
You drinkin' that with a swagger, right?
I'm drinkin' this to get fucked up!
Still Reserves to kill my nerves
Plus a motherfuckin' liquor full of hunch punch! (Yeah)
Jarren Benton don't care for sippin'
On that Red Fad, that there expensive shit we drinkin' on
We're more concerned with where the women at, and there you sittin'
Sippin' on some Rosé, thinkin' that girl gon' care and she isn't
I already fucked up girl off of PBR Push, I swear I didn't! (Haha)
Gangstas all about where you livin'
You grew up on that patron silver
I grew up in Decatur bitch!
Don't get down, not fuckin' feelin' that
G do shit fallin' down in the bar
'Fore we cruise to Decatur for some fast food
Party like a white boy for so long
And the truth is I used to be a black dude!
Ha ha, Tom P!

Walk around this bitch just like my dick was freakin' eight feet long
Yo, hey when I make it, they gon' fear the day I drop
I swear to God when that they come that T.I. could top me off top
187 on the undercover cop, this hip-hop, no, nigga, not pop
Beat down blocks, when the aterway drop
Six feet deep, sleep in a pine box
Fuck Cristal, ?? Shots

Till I die, nigga no won't stop
Till I rot, bitch, I'm 'gon rock
Basket case, pass the blade, maskin' tape
Bash his face, crash this place, and smash his day
