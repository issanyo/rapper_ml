[Chorus]
We smoking dope, stacking dough
Punching niggas, smacking hoes
Move back get the fuck up out my way nigga
Move back get the fuck up out my way nigga
We rolling dope, stacking dough
Punching niggas, smacking hoes
Move back get the fuck up out my way nigga
Move back get the fuck up out my way nigga

[Verse 1:Jarren Benton]
Live on set, choppers on deck
Blade sharp enough to go and chop a nigga's neck
Big Pun nigga hit the ho with the tech
Never gave a fuck about stones over gats
Do it from a zone, throwin' up a set
Spaz out like a mothafucka with Tourettes
East Side E.T. spaced out cadet
Put it in her pussy make it smoke a cigarette
Morning bitches, buenos dias
On a white girl, Cameron Diaz
You know me as, Jarren Benton
Got a couple hoes duct taped in the Prius
Came up nigga same Cadillac doors
If she outta pocket, handle that ho
Gun on a mantle, I'ma grab it by the handle
I'ma throw it at a nigga when the bullets all blown (BLAW!)
Adderall pill, crush it up sniff it
Codeine soda pop pour it up sip it
If she down wit it let ya home girl lick it
I'll join in, smack it, flip it
Pabst Blue Ribbon, parking lot Pibben
Put it on a rag, chloroform get 'em
Murder mothafuckas when they put me in the booth
Click click POW, get 'em, kill 'em!

[Chorus]
