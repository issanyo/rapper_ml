[Verse 1]
Terrorist on the beat, in a booth with a jacket that's filled with C-4
When this needle hit 'em they dying like Philip Seymour
Hoffman, fucking weirdo, I sleep in a coffin
I don't sip promethazine for coughing
I told my chick to sneak this fifth in her purse
It's more rappers, guess I dig a bigger ditch in the Earth
Your new bitch my old bitch, I stick my dick in her first
Fuck your favorite rapper, nigga just a bitch in a skirt
Can't afford a casket so we sit up stiff in a hearse
Mama fucked an alien, I came out different at birth
Son of a cyborg, slice him with a samurai sword
Cherish both of my kids, that's something to die for
Dive off a five-floor
Then land in the drivers side of a white Ford
Catch him at the show and I'll strangle him with the mic chord
Name a rapper better than Jarren so I can sever them
I'm running out of medicine, fuck it, I'll sniff Excedrin
Fuck you and your next of kin and the rest of them
And a random Mexican, I'm tripping off of mescaline
Niggas full of estrogen, address me as your excellence
Fucking mad man wrestling elephants
Lord knows, I woke up in a new Bugatti with two new hotties
I kicked them hoes out the whip just like I knew karate
Rest in peace to Big L, Biggie and 2Pac
We can have a bar fight, I'll slam his head in the jukebox
What it do, Nas? Yeah, this dude knock
These other lames are about as hot as like 2 watts
Live in a glass house, but they threw rocks
I came out ready to kill them all with the tube cocked
So high five, guys, look on the bright side
Ain't have enough gas money to do the drive-by
You could see the pain in my soul, just look in my eyes
I'mma rep it right, it's hip hop 'til I die

[Hook]
I came out ready to kill them all with the tube cocked
You could see the pain in my soul, just look in my eyes
I think they watching me, I know it's just the reefer
You could see the pain, just look in my eyes
I'mma rep it right, I'mma rep it right
Fuck your favorite rapper, nigga just a bitch in a skirt
Name a rapper better than Jarren so I can sever them
Niggas full of estrogen, address me as your excellence

[Verse 2]
I'll let the Mac pop you, pass the hash and Vodka
Came out of my mama's vag and went and smacked the doctor
I think they watching me; I know it's just the reefer
You fucking with the wrong niggas, just like Justin Bieber
I'm not afraid to die like 'Oh it's just the Reaper"
I'm sick like I just ingested ether
I'm telepathic, I heard you like the smell of faggots
K-C-I-D-T-A-E, bitch, spell it backwards
I'm out in LA stuck in hella traffic
My son pissed because I put a parent block on all the shows thats graphic
Microphone addict
A creep just staring out his window of his lair
While the village throwing stones at it
I'm stillmatic, got a bitch that's a pill addict
I shoot the shit with my grandmomma while she peel cabbage
I fuck hoes with low self-esteem to feel average
As a kid I stalked the forest just to kill rabbits
Rappers sensitive like bitches on their menstrual
I show you what I been through with a pencil
Writing life on instrumentals, y'all niggas very sentimental
Kill him and put him inside off the back of a Lincoln Continental
The night stalker is a slight talker
On the fucking moon fighting martians with lightsabers like Skywalker
Stomping haters, it's spilling blood on my Timberlands
You never killed a nigga in the hood like Zimmerman, bitch

[Hook]
