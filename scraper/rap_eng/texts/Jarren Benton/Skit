Ladies and gentlemen
I bring to you myself, Jarren Benton
Thats my fucking government
I go by that shit because it's like I can't find anything that fits me but me
Look here I'm just a mother fucking weirdo that loves music
You know, let me tell you a true story
I just had a mo fucking, I just had a interview at L.A. Reid and a bunch of Def Jam executives right?
I'm all amped like this is my moment right? this is my moment this is my fucking moment
I rap for two fucking songs or whatever and the nigga L.A. Reid wouldn't look at me in the eye
And it was like. dont look at me mother fucker, you're not on my level yet you son of a bitch
I jump on the mother fucking table this nigga rip his fuckin paper like this kid is a fucking disgrace, get him the fuck outta here
But I walked outta that mother fucker like damn i fucked an oppurtunity up
So this is me startin to fuck over man, fuck that oppurtunity man
If the shit ain't fuckin hip for me it ain't meant for me
But you can't stop Jarren Benton
