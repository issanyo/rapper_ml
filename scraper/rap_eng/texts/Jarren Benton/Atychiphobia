[Verse 1: Jarren Benton]
I done risked my life for this so fuck some
Lame ass fuck nigga saying he ain't feeling me
That shit just made me stronger
So keep on shooting bitch you ain't killing me
I still wake up worried like fuck it
Any minute everything could come down crashing
And it's back to them bullshit 9 to 5s
And them niggas behind your back laughing
Like, where the fuck did I go wrong
Fight suicide thoughts like hold on
I don't ever wanna go back when I felt insecure
And so low y'all, I went so strong
Too much pain I need an oxicodone
Left for dead in the cold, no coat on
Brain was so gone, that was so long
Couldn't get a break no Turbo Ozone
Same old slow song we all dance to
Some die young, didn't get a chance to
Live their dreams, just a bullet from a 9 millimeter
Going in your head like shampoo
Get going, still fight the same phobia
Don't let this fear paralyze and keep holding you
One day you wake up today through shit
Tomorrow these unloyal fucks will get over ya
Live great for my kid's sake
Spit pain over mixtapes
And you find out who your real friend
Cause when shit gets tough and them niggas turn away then that shit's fake
Last year I had to shed a few tears
Lost a good friend, had to pour a few beers
Why when everything goes right
Niggas find a way to fuck it up, still waking up with new fears

[Hook: Hemi]
And everytime you hear me I'm trying just to wind the clock back and keep my 15 minutes of fame
Knowing every second that the clock ticks a million other people trying to take my spot and get in the game
This is all I've ever wanted and it's all I know so I gotta hold on
I gotta do it for my family, I can't let them down, I'm so afraid to fail, but they think I'm so strong
But I got Atychiphobia
I ain't come this far to fall
I got Atychophobia
No I ain't come this far to fall
I got Atychophobia
The world's all watching, the world's all waiting
And I don't know why I'm so afraid
But I got Atychophobia

[Verse 2: Wrekonize]
Break down when the clock stops
Hot on the downhill movement
What the mother fuck have I been doin'
Everybody got their own illusion
Stop watch as my life fades
Hopscotch and run tirades
Till the lock pops and I fly straight
I'mma stock shots and run sideways
I'm made in the ice age
Don't cross blades on an off day
Cause I rock stages, not cosplay
These fake fucks are off Broadway
Stock shades on my face of course
Time melts into the base and morphs
To the great divorce and I pray for more
That's just a countdown faster than [?]

[Verse 3: Bernz]
Why these bitches standing in line for their new phones
Iâ€™m scheming, and plotting, and working my options, and burning my new wrongs
Repping the fam and cooking the ham we hotter than two suns
They know who I am but the fans that'll have me on record broke out of the group homes
With some new [?] in Miami the Cadillac's two toned
No time to be wasting, my homies are famous
We never look back, we make new songs
The music is strange and the singers are dangerous
I'll never grow old and the clock will be painted
I'm feeling immortal and popping like Orville
We all got a phobia, gotta disorder that wastes us

[Hook]
