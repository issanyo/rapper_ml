[Intro]
Tragedy with my nigga Jarren Benton
Cyrus on the beat
Shoutout to the whole Funk Volume
Let's go

[Hook]

[Verse 1: $Tragedy$]

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Jarren Benton]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, let's go
How many y'all pop out? A million
I'm tryna make a billion
Pull up, hop out, killin' em
Nah we ain't feelin' 'em
Eastside, fresh prince, throwing hoes out the front door, Uncle Phil'n them
Snakeskin shell-toes, call 'em reptilian
From the A, spend a lot of time down in Michigan
Fuck up the booth like nitroglycerin
Milk box niggas, have they whole family missin' 'em
Goldiggin' them, hoes ain't kissing them
Beat the pussy up then cripple them
This my year, my millenium
Pussy niggas grillin' 'em
Cause their girlfriend swallowed all my chil-d-ren
Mr. Benton, my whole brain missing
Pull a switchblade on a nigga then stick him
My mind don't work if my spine ain't twitching
No Dopeboyz spend their whole time in the kitchen
Yeah, tryna get dough like Betty Crocker
Throw a hatin' motherfucker out a helicopter
Got knives and choppers
Have it your way, like a BK Whopper
Keep it a million, swinging from a fan on the ceiling
Do a drive-by and we grill 'em
FV 2-0-1-3, bitch y'all hatin' ass niggas fuck with Mr. Benton
