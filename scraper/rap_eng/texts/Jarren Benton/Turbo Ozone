{INTRO}
How is everyone doin'? (Yeeaahh)
How to be a hooker: "Get the payment up front!" (uh-huh-uh-huh)
Hehe, is that what their teaching you in home ec when we're in shop?

[Chorus: Jarren Benton]
Damn, bitch, you so rad
Whatever you want just throw it in the bag
You gonna make a nigga have a heart attack
Walkin' around here with all that ass
Drop one time, I spend my last
I go home my wife goes spaz:
"You stupid motherfucker, on some pussy you spent all our cash"

{VERSE 1: Jarren Benton}
D-E-C-A-T-U-R G-A, that's word on my block
The way you move, goddamn that's cool, it'll put a dude like me in a pine box
I wonder can you go both ways?
Can you bring another girl, is it cool if I watch?
The way she ,pop-pop, lock-lock, drop-drop
The girl bring it back like Time Cop
Hypnotize, mesmerize, electrified, by that ass and thighs
You some sort of sorceress
I'm in this bitch again
I think I just spent up my mortgage
Do you smoke or do you snort it? (Snort it)
Which way do we orbit? (Orbit)
Hoes on my dick, 'cause I look like Chuck Norris
Her ass so enormous
An that pussy worth a fortune
Ka-Ka-Kato killed this beat
My nigga please bring in my chorus
I SAY!

[Chorus 2: Jarren Benton]
Damn, she's a bad bitch, I put her on attention
Her ass is like an acid tab, she got my mind trippin'
I'm up in here like every night, she got your boy trickin'
When that pussy get to poppin' then my dollars get to spendin'
T—T—Turbo ozone, turbo ozone
Turbo ozone, turbo ozone
Make that pussy pop, make that pussy pop
Make that pussy pop, make that pussy pop

{VERSE 2}
Turbo, ozone
Damn dude I am so gone
This shit we chiefin' on
Go put a hole inside the ozone
She always give me slow dome
When that dj play a slow song
Her head control my body
Man I call that bitch Voltron
Damn where did I go wrong?
Just took out a bank loan
Must of lost my mind they keep on knockin'
But I ain't home
Her pussy just like napalm
That mean it is a bomb
If you ain't got no money
Take broke ass where you came from
The way that pussy pop
She had me stuck off in a trance
I'm up in here like every night
So I can see her dance
She turn me to a stalker
I'm her number one fan
In less then sixty seconds
I've already dropped a grand

{BRIDGE}

D-D-Damn man I'm trippin'
What's this shit I'm sippin'
Her body like a AK
I just wanna stick my clip in
Addicted to the stripper's man
They got your boy trickin'
When that pussy get to poppin'
Then my dollar's get to spendin'
I SAY!
