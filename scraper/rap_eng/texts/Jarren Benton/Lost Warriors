[Hook]
When the sky ain't blue
And God goes mute
And money dictating everything that you do
The drugs all gone but the world still spins
And Lucifer becomes your best friend
Damn, we lost warriors
In the city of lost warriors

[Verse 1]
Uh, I'm just another lost warrior, chasing a feeling of euphoria
Can't shake the imagine or my nigga in the coroner
So I medicate with alcohol and Adderall
So I can feel something I'm too numb to rock to y'all
Chasing an emptiness that money brings, a fucking glutton
I want it all, everything that I could obtain
Becoming so accustomed at hiding my pain
Knowing that this poison is rotting my brain
At the rate I'm going, I'm plotting my grave
Under limelights, I die for my spot on the stage
I'm feeling like God's gone mute
Or maybe I muted God for something that's so minute
I'm a heretic, inheriting the ways of the lost
Pray that I don't pass the baton to my son
Nor my princess, Lord what I've become
So petrified, like what am I hiding from?
Deal with little boy shit, keep on whispering in your ear
I got to kill the voices, they keep preying on my fears
Lost some good friends, the evil slaying all my peers
When I know I need help, I let my demons interfere

[Hook]
When the sky ain't blue
And God goes mute
And money dictating everything that you do
The drugs all gone but the world still spins
And Lucifer becomes your best friend
Damn, we lost warriors
In the city of lost warriors

[Verse 2]
Yeah, uh, I mask the pain like a superhero
Drugs in my system, mind on my Euros
Suicidal thought, my daughter was a year old
The feeling coming back that whispers by my earlobes
The Mephistopheles is watching me
It bore with the feeling of a nigga feeling obsolete
On the road constantly, my son get emotional
Daughter used to it, when I'm back, I'm so unsociable
Coming home drunk as fuck, this liquor got me out cold
Pray that this behavior don;t destroy a nigga's household
I think my nigga's death took a piece of me
I know we in the sky, rest in peace fully
Hoping I ain't fucking everything up for five mights
Of fifteen minutes of a nigga in the limelight
Regrets come to haunt your fucking hindsight
As soon as you try to find God and get your mind right

[Hook]
When the sky ain't blue
And God goes mute
And money dictating everything that you do
The drugs all gone but the world still spins
And Lucifer becomes your best friend
Damn, we lost warriors
In the city of lost warriors
