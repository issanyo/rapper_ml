[Intro:]
Jarren Benton here, live and direct
If you just now tunin' in that means you 'bout to enter:
Funk Volume's: Don't Fu[n]k Up Our Beats Contest bitch!
Look here, there's only one way to do this shit...

[Verse:]
Ya, ya, okay
FV two-oh-one-three bitch
Honey I'm home it's dinner time bitch
Come on, no knees 'bout to sit on my dick
Heard you wanna murder me you better get in line quick
Pimp hoes, hit 'em with the Jedi mind trick
This my year, nigga better shine bitch
Duck one high, when you hit a nice spliff
Got my first blowjob way back in '96
Back like a 2Pac hologram
Kill a nigga then I put his body in the mausoleum
Break a fucking leg, bet you lean, him without a limb
I'll be damned, but 'em in the dirt, better body 'dem
Jesus Christ, he just nights, he beats his wife, and eat this rice
I eat this knife, I eat these mics, I need this life!
I'm the shit whore, like feces right?
Okay, fuck's sake nigga
Kickin' down the door I'm 'bout to duct tape niggas
Soft as a pillow you a cupcake nigga
Mr. Benton hold on, I'm 'bout to update niggas
How the hell you a G when you butt rape niggas?
Hold up, shout out to my upstate niggas
Blood got a beat that'll make the track bleed
Look back like, "Go ahead, suffocate nigga!"
