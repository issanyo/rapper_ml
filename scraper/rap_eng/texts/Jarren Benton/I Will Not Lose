It's my time, and I ain't losin'
Feet glued to the earth and I ain't movin'
Fuckin' monster
The game's mutant
Pray for death to rappers makin' lame music
I'm sittin' in flames
I'm fixin' to rain
I'm sick in the brain
I'm sick of this pain
I'm slittin' my vein
This prick is deranged
I'm stickin' my lane, just grippin' that grain
I feel like I'm losin' a step in the game???
Feelin' like nothing's gon' change
Feelin' like I am to blame
Feelin' so high as a plane
Pimpin', I'm out of your range
Target inside of your aim
They're sayin' that Jarren is strange
This energy can't be contained
Somethin' I cannot explain
Maybe I'm just insane
Haters throw dirt on my name
Rappers, I'm leavin' them slain
Beat 'em and kill 'em and pick up their flesh right the bottom of my fangs
Feel like I've paid up my dues
Thinkin' not fit in my shoes
Ready to kill all my niggas
I will not lose
