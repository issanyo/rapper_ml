[Verse 1: Jarren Benton]
I spaz on these hoes like the Birdman
Mr. Benton bitch its curtains
So fresh and clean with no detergent
Ill nigga get a surgeon
You gotta watch out for the serpent
If that pussy good she'll get a Birkin
I fill my Thermos up with Bourbon
So high like "where the fuck the Earth went?"
Oh no, nigga this is a horror show
We run this shit better work on your cardio
We killing shit nigga like the Sicario
After the show its a party ho
Pop out the gutter like Mario
Get the dough from [?] to Barbie, yo
I cried when Benny shot at Carlito
I fucked a lot of hoes I hardly know
Hallelujah rest in peace to Prince
My niggas falling out that's word to Peter Wentz
Niggas wonder why the FV split
I'm independent they can't tell me shit
I'm drunk as fuck I hit the cement twice
I pop a pill to help me sleep at night
Hallelujah word to Jesus Christ
We lost a lot of legends rest in peace to Phife

[Bridge: Elz Jenkins]
I might down a four, I might do the dab
I might pop a pill, I might drop a tab
I might roll a blunt, I might smoke a Xan
I might hit the spot, I might show up, smash

[Hook: Elz Jenkins]
Hop in a foreign, I'm killing the lane, my foot on the gas
Smash
Start this shit and we jump on the couch and we fuck this shit up and we
Smash
Met the lil' hoe, and I bend the lil' hoe, and I hit the lil' hoe and I
Smash
Pipe up the spot, and we make this shit hot and get banned from the spot and we
Smash

[Verse 2: Jarren Benton]
Still murdering shit in a Mink coat
No habla these fuck niggas lingo
I'm laid on the beach out in Santo Domingo
The Desert Eagle might be tucked in the jean coat
Whose side am I on, nigga Dame or Hop?
I'll murder both of them niggas, just name a spot
I be there in a flash with the stainless cocked
This for Ms. Tomica Wright, I leave you brainless Hop!
I'm joking, still loving my brethren
Jarren throwed off like I've had at the [?]
I laugh at the Reverend
Put you on a highway to Heaven
I'm out for revenge like that guy in the Revenant
Black Mac 11, clap at you peasants
My uncle smoke his crack get high as a pheasant
I let my babies know that life is a blessing
And when I'm on the road my wife just be stressing
Hallelujah rest in peace to shawty
Y'all can suck my dick until the semen gone
Niggas wonder what the weed be on
Can't sleep at night without the TV on
Hallelujah motherfuck the peace
The bully's homies, niggas cut that bitch
Never catch me on no sucker shit
And we don't fucking quit until we fucking rich

[Bridge: Elz Jenkins]
I might down a four, I might do the dab
I might pop a pill, I might drop a tab
I might roll a blunt, I might smoke a Xan
I might hit the spot, I might show up, smash

[Hook: Elz Jenkins]
Hop in a foreign, I'm killing the lane, my foot on the gas
Smash
Start this shit and we jump on the couch and we fuck this shit up and we
Smash
Met the lil' hoe, and I bend the lil' hoe, and I hit the lil' hoe and I
Smash
Pipe up the spot, and we make this shit hot and get banned from the spot and we
