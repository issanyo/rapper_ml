[Intro: Elz Jenkins]
If money grows on trees then your boy owns a forest
Hoes on my dick cause I look like Chuck Norris
Hey, they say I look like Chuck Norris
I’m fucking with yall

[Hook: Jarren Benton]
And I’ve been on it all day
Feelin’ good, feelin’ great
And they say, Jarren you so sick
Justin Bieber, I got hoes on my dick
I got hoes on my dick so they call me Justin Bieber
I got hoes on my dick so they call me Justin Bieber
I got hoes on my... I got hoes on my...
I got hoes on my dick so they call me Justin Bieber

[Verse 1: Jarren Benton]
I think I’m E.T., still throwin’ up that T-B-
G run away from a bitch with a little bit of itch
Man, that might be an S-T-
D in the back in the Lac with a little bit of yack
And I’m blowin’ on that best weed
Do a drive-by on a Jet Ski, fresh new kicks like Jet Lee
Pull a blade on a nigga Wesley
Snipes so bitch don’t text me
Eastside ho, where the best be
What’s this pill, that’s E
Oh that’s why I can’t sleep
Sucka ass nigga wanna test me
Cut a nigga’s head off with a chainsaw lookin’ at a muthafucka like Let's eat
They say he ain’t got it all
Crushin’ up my Tylenol
Lick it off these cotton balls
Oxycontin, Retinol
Zonin’ out off I’ve gotten lost
Now my dick has gotten soft
She say I’m too high to fuck so therefore she is signin’ off
I think I’m Jesus Christ, kill me I come back to life
Multiply, come back in fight with sharper knives and take your life
Cheifin’ on a quarter pound
Hit the town, it’s going down
Gone off the same dope the shit that fucked up Bobby Brown

[Hook: Jarren Benton]

[Verse 2: Elz Jenkins]
E-l-z, I need my dope
My chain got Bruce Leroy glow
You get drunk, think you swole
Get ya buzz cut like Amber Rose
You talk shit, fuck you sayin’?
Show up on your block with the AK sprayin’
Long range headshot JFK 'em
Put ‘em on a white sheet, KKK
Wanna know my recipe?
Jeezy mixed with Justin B
I done sold coke and weed
You should buy your coke from me
Nation wide and locally
Find a block and shut it down
Got dick off in your bitch’s stomach, watch it on an ultrasound
And catch me cursin’ at my jewelry watch
Face full of stones like it looks right at Medusa’s
Bitches lovin’ me cause man they say I’m so cute
And if the money talks I bet these niggas so mute

[Hook: Elz Jenkins]

[Verse 3: Jarren Benton]
I’m so out of the Atmosphere
Sipping on a Pabst beer
Jarren Benton, I’m up in this bitch just like a pepsmier
You niggas are last year
My sweater is Kashmir
You niggas are fuckin’ geeks so we tryna get cash here
Yeah, I run this bitch just like an athlete
Bet these rappers takin’ in their ass just like they Rasby
Fresh Prince of Georgia
Where the fuck is Ashley?
She said don’t cum in her so I put it on her ass cheeks
And I’m too sexy for my Levis
Yes, I’ve been in this shit since I’ve been playin’ around with G.I
Joes, I’m on a roll, I’m on the same pill as T.I
And if you lookin’ for me find me on the Eastside
My lil’ cousin said his favorite rappers me and Waka Flocka
Jumpin’ out of helicopters, stumpin’ on you muthafuckas
And she do it with no hands
Gone off the same shit that fucked up Lindsay Lohan

[Hook: Jarren Benton]
