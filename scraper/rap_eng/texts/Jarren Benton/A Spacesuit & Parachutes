[Verse 1: Jarren Benton]
Earth to Mr. Benton
Man these pills got me feeling like the Earth is missin’
And you so pussy you can birth an infant
And I’m here to spoon feed you fuckers something different
Zone 6 lunatics we will bury you
I’m so fuckin’ high I need a spacesuit and parachutes
Supermarket knife attack
Put a hit out on the booth, now show me where the mic is at
Battlestar Galactica
These niggas ain’t real they’re like Avatars and Dracula
Haters wanna shoot me out the sky like Galaga
Soaring out the Earth with your bitch in the passanger
These niggas ain’t ready homes
They are on romanic get aways with Bishop Eddie Long
Welcome to the Terradome
And I am no neurologist but your bitch gives me hella dome

[Hook: Jarren Benton]
And I am feelin’ so fuckin’ rad
Totally awsome dude, the best feelin’ I’ve had
I bet they wonder what we smoke
They wanna travel where we go
But you should know we don’t need no roads
Propose a toast cause we’re on top now
I’m up in Mars with the top down
They wanna travel where we go
Put that flame up to that killer, let it smoke
We don’t need no woose

[Verse 2: Aleon Craft]
Mothership Decatur blasting off-off
To another galaxy with a pretty ass Martian break her off-off
It licks her soft, inside her jaw
Travelling through wormholes folding space to a brand new world
Then it’s back to the Earth, Cadillac no skirt with paint like a brand new curl
Yeah, that thang tripping, energy’s constant, no beginning
Bitch I’m a monster, mic’s on ripping
My shit be bumping, eardrum bleeding
Kush platform, no babysitting
I transform, supreme new being
I go hard, I can pitch nine innings
C.C. Sabathia
You don’t really want me after ya
East ATLiens kinda throwed off
We settle like traffickers
Soundwaves and decibels
Hack in the brainwaves, tappin’ the mainframe
Girls go crazy, make ‘em wanna hit that flow, drop low and back it up
Haters just pack it up
Pinch my cheek I’m mess it up
Too far gone, I’m an astronaut
You’re not doper than presrciption durgs
Alien crafts, spittin’ sky rap
Solar system fly, Google sky map

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Jarren Benton]
Same shit different day, the planet still orbitin’
Marty so fly I’m pullin’ hoes in my DeLorean
Where we’re goin’ we don’t need roads
Just a gas mask, oxygene and some weed smoke
So fresh, so clean, I’m an Outkast
Eastside, ain’t hit a nigga, doubt that
When I pull up in the Chevy with the bass beatin’ heavy
Tell me what you motherfuckers know about that
Yeah, Jarren John Rambo
Suicide bomb a sucka nigga, yeah I plan to blow
Cram a dick down your nana’s throat
Bitch if you sick then I’m the motherfuckin’ antidote
Bullshit walks and money flies
The industry is a bunch of fuckin’ robots like Johnny Five
Honey hi, I’m home, and they wonder what I am on
And I’ve got so high I’m blown
And they wonder where I have gone
Right here in the twilight zone
My spaceship flies alone
Here all I need just two turn tables and one microphone

[Hook]
