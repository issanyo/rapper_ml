[Intro]
Kato on the track bitch

[Chorus: Jarren Benton]
Ice block on me, nigga everything froze
She just wanna party she put *sniff* in her nose
Flexin' on these hoes, you know everythin' goes
Pull up in a skrrt and make everythin' froze
Everythin' froze nigga, everythin' froze

[Verse 1: Emilio Rojas]
I'm pullin' off with a lot of chips, if she with me then the body thick
Yea, I'm whippin' around in a Tesla, charge it as quick as the iPhone X
How many haters have I finessed? I've seen they shit and I'm not impressed
I like my women the way that they like they mimosas, bottomless
Yeah wakin' up and goin' on a run for the money
I ain't come from no money but I came for the money
Give up the tough talk for the big dogs
You are not a shooter, I can tell because you aimed at me funny, oh
I spend a sack on a Gucci belt, I spend a sack on some jeans
You spend a stack on a month of rent, you can not stack up to me

[Chorus: Jarren Benton]
Ice block on me, nigga everythin' froze
She Just wanna party she put *sniff* in her nose
Flexin' on these hoes, you know everythin' goes
Pull up in a skrrt and make everythin' froze
Everythin' froze, nigga everythin' froze

[Verse 2: Demrick]
You pistol poppin' or you really rockin'
It's the fame so you really poppin'
Deep pockets like you Ali Baba
EBT shopper live from the projects
Just freeze, oh you know me
Just a lil bit of liquor, lil weed
Couple bitches all a nigga really needs

[Verse 3: Oktane]
Yeah, sounds about right, hold up, yes
I think we got 'em upset
They know what's comin up next
They know we takin' all bets
Third lap, high as a jet
Propane blowin' see that's simple and plain homie
Take it without one chain on me
Boy, I'm cold as

[Chorus: Jarren Benton]
Ice block on me nigga, everything froze
She just wanna party she put *sniff* in her nose
Flexin' on these hoes, you know everythin' goes
Pull up in a skrrt and make everythin' froze
Everythin' froze, nigga everythin' froze

[Verse 4: Reezy]
Subzero froze nigga, I been drippin' ice
Timer on the wrist might cost a nigga life
Stars in the roof take a bitch outer space
You could have her back but she'll be an hour late
They ain't cold-blooded, Rick James, swoop her up like Lyft, man
Been on the toilet, shit-stain, how he froze but he big flame

[Verse 5: Dizzy Wright]
Damn
Air BNB goin' up like the bud, rollin' up when I leave you can still smell the weed
Kush comas got 'em all froze, that's what you get for tryna face the Dizzy OG
I'm still cookin' in the meantime, in between time in the kitchen like I'm Jimmy Iovine
Where Dr. Dre at? I wanna tell him that I be where all the greats at
We in Texas goin' dumb on 6th Street, lettin' my sauces drip
Learn how Superhead got her nickname, when I realize your girl had an awesome grip
Damn don't be the one, actin' like we ain't used to all of this gold
Actin' like we ain't used to all these hoes, some of y'all niggas gonna get it then fold
But me

[Chorus: Jarren Benton]
Ice block on me nigga everythin' froze
She just wanna party she put *sniff* in her nose
Flexin' on these hoes, you know everythin' goes
Pull up in a skrrt and make everythin' froze

[Verse 6: Price]
Let me get her
Tell her she don't need that blow, elevate off this smoke
10 degrees below, everythin' gone, Price froze
Get a pack, flip a pack, lost it all, get it back
Nigga don't sell your soul, die by the gun 'cause he tried to run
Jake up on me like I'm Isaac's son, killin' of shit like Kaiser, huh
Rappin' like Em with the visor, huh, In the mirror like what I become
Beat that pussy down till the sirens come, you the one lyin' hope you violent, huh
But get in person, be the one who silent, huh, scoreboard look about 5 to 1
When it come to stash, she know all of my raps
If she don't get Saks then she turn into a brat
Slavery comin' back, yeah it's turnin' into that
Snip, snip, cut her if she ever get attached
Got my own gas, we ain't ever got a match
F's what you get, I'm the letter after that
G, you lil bitch, no competitor that could rap
With the clique, if her ass fat let her in the trap
Let the hoes choose who get chosen and frozen with

[Chorus: Jarren Benton]
Ice block on me, nigga everythin' froze
She just wanna party she put *sniff* in her nose
Flexin' on these hoes, you know everythin' goes
Pull up in a skrrt and make everythin' froze
Everythin' froze, nigga everythin' froze
