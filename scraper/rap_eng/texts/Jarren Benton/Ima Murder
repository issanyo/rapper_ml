[Verse 1]
I kill a beat and paralyze a chorus
Fuck up your city like they let loose a Tyrannosaurus
Uh my pen is definite since rigamortous
My tongue's a lethal weapon here my bitch is a sorceress
Three Sixes and torches, three killers on horses
Drag a bitch through the forest
Oh the scene is so morbid so sick and so torturess
But Jarren adores it
So open your eyes bitches you better absorb it
I'm painting you portaits they feeding you horse shit
Their visions distorted leave them dead in theyre porsches
There's voices inside my head but I'm scared of these forces
They want me to kill turning rappers to corpses
I'm chopping 'em up put there organs in porridge
I hunger for blood appetite is enormous
And this is ether through your speakers
I can't sleep until I introduce you niggas to the Reaper

[Hook]
Cause they so infatuated with the cars and the clothes
Me I got a thing for stabbing beats and killing flows
I'm a murder, murder, murder, murder
Blood stains cover up my hands and on my paper
Bodies in the trunk of other rappers and you haters
I'm a murder, murder, murder, murder

[Verse 2]
K-I-L-L-E-R Killer
Pop right back from the dead like Thriller
ATLien Eastside nigguh
Sips malt liqour
Sick thoughts nigguh
Semi-Automatic I'm a terminate a faggot
When the body decompose you can only see the maggots
Cut a motherfuckers head off with a hatchet
J's back at it sick black magic
Infatuated with murder
Intoxicated I'll serve up
Them bodies thick when they burn up
My DNA will not turn up
Whack ass shit don't concern us
Got bodies locked in my basement
They on the floor or in the furnace
I'm feeling insane my brains about to pop
I think I'm changing I'm transforming like an auto bot
I keep on killing what a feeling no I'm not gonna stop
Electric Shock Therapy better but what a thousand watts
Straight jackets come equipped with 38 latches
Not enough to contain a man with a crazed habit
And this is ether through your speakers
I can't sleep until I introduce you niggas to the Reaper

[Hook]
Cause they so infatuated with the cars and the clothes
Me I got a thing for stabbing beats and killing flows
I'm a murder, murder, murder, murder
Blood stains cover up my hands and on my paper
Bodies in the trunk of other rappers and you haters
I'm a murder, murder, murder, murder
