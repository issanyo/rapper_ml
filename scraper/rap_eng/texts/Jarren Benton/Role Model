[Verse 1: Eric Biddines]
Yesterday was a moment that came soon
I expect to be a blessing, what other way should I prove
That we don’t need a picture, develop the focused minds
When it disenvision spitting like man that’s a cool design
Smoking on stone, barefooted, no food
Barely clean water flowing for drinking, and think of shoes
Was you dreaming it's on, you know what song
When you’re shot you came home, and electric still on
Got a call from a place that you can’t reach with a phone
This a message for the people in the form of a song
Strong bones build walls like a concrete tower
Rained pourin' till it's fell from the clouds like showers
Broken soul, need a healing, when you’re hoping for change
I just notice if you’re thinking that’s a moment of power
This an elevator, step into the proper direction
I’m the perfect man who listen, I’m projecting perception

[Hook: Eric Biddines & Amber Monique]
Y’all don’t know that I don’t want no problems
Trying to provide me a role model
I done turned a penny to a whole dollar
Missin' lane hoping I’m on full throttle
Y’all don’t know that I don’t want no problems
Trying to provide me a role model
I done turned a penny to a whole dollar
Missin' lane hoping I’m on full throttle

[Verse 2: Bun B]
Waking up in the cold world with no heat
BSB, bop it up and down your street
The world we live in is crooked and corrupt
So we got to let the next generation know what’s up
We got to give em the game they need to survive
Make sure they don’t just exist, but that they thrive
Staying alive, know on days it ain’t a given
Got to be aware of the surroundings that you live in
It don’t matter who you are or what you’re repping
There’s some booby traps laid so watch where you’re stepping
See they don’t really want us to win
Hell, they really didn’t even want to let us in
But keep on striving and keep on hoping
Won’t be long before the doors is opened
You can break out of the crazy hood that you left it
Wise words from the OG and EFN, baby

[Hook: Eric Biddines & Amber Monique]
Y’all don’t know that I don’t want no problems
Trying to provide me a role model
I done turned a penny to a whole dollar
Missin' lane hoping I’m on full throttle
Y’all don’t know that I don’t want no problems
Trying to provide me a role model
I done turned a penny to a whole dollar
Missin' lane hoping I’m on full throttle

[Verse 3: Jarren Benton]
Tryna be a role model, so many issues, I down the whole bottle
Used to feel inadequate, fuck it, didn’t want to see tomorrow
Niggas put too much hope in Barack
Kids grow up fatherless, their mama smoking on rocks
Where the role models when we out strolling these blocks
Ain’t no rocket scientists, no lawyers or docs
Crackheads, dope boys, single mothers, and cops
They fear for their life, can’t cherish any moment they got
That’s the mind of a young soldier in these lost communities
His 13th eulogy, where is the opportunities?
Ain’t no young dreamers, the reality’s a nightmare
We bitch over policies, kids deserve the right care
Fuck the crooked office of politicians and preachers
Waiting on some leader to reach us, nigga please
Seen some dark clouds, the sky forever blue
Dream big young kings, the role model is you

[Hook: Eric Biddines & Amber Monique]
Y’all don’t know that I don’t want no problems
Trying to provide me a role model
I done turned a penny to a whole dollar
Missin' lane hoping I’m on full throttle
Y’all don’t know that I don’t want no problems
Trying to provide me a role model
I done turned a penny to a whole dollar
Missin' lane hoping I’m on full throttle
