[Verse 1: Jarren Benton]
Yea, spend all my money on liquor and strippers
Fall off in the beef with some ignorant niggas
Aye shout out to Hopsin, aye shout out to Dizzy
Aye fuck with me Hoppa, aye fuck with me SwizZz
I can't stop thinking 'bout money and pussy
I ain't no killa but you niggas pushed me
Put the booth in the hearse, put the track in the mausoleum
Go play somewhere nigga, I'm working, don't bother him
Nigga got his brains popped for a Jesus piece
Be careful 'cause somebody hoe got the Eazy-E
I used to pray that I'd get put on by Dr. Dre
Elz get the chopper, it's time to cooperate
Ain't nobody dies if you all would cooperate
Then he bop on that hoe with a glass of Courvoisier
Back against the wall, dick inside the dirt
Fuck a Plan B, plan A 'bout to work

[Chorus: Jarren Benton]
Ride around in my side of town
I'm Whitney Houston and Bobby Brown
4AM and it's going down
No one make a move and no one make a sound, 'bout to
Get it, get it, get it, get it, get it, get it
Get it, get it, get it, get it, get it, get it
All day gon' hit it, I'm 'bout to
Get it, get it, get it, get it, get it, get it
Get it, get it, get it, get it, get it, get it
All day, all night, nigga I'mma get it

[Verse 2: Jarren Benton]
I might tell the bitch I love her but no I don't trust a hoe
Are they real sisters? I don't care, so I fuck them both
My childhood was no reflection of the show 'bout the Huxtables
Niggas started getting money, now we getting comfortable
All they still sending shots like they did Big and Pac
My Glock is [?], yea baby I need a bigger spot
I'mma get rich, I'mma die rich, yea nigga watch
Brass-knuckle-Benton baby, yea I'm so unorthodox
Get my feet on the table when I'm at the meeting at the corporate spot
Ain't no justice for a nigga so we go and explode the cops
Young nigga tryna make a way, so he hit the block
Flick the wrist and stir the pot, call the boy Sir Mix-A-Lot
I ain't want to see my nigga laying stiff up in the box
She gon' give me raw head while I'm sitting in the drop
Living my life like a nigga 'bout to die any minute
Bounce back from the bullshit now I'm 'bout to get it

[Chorus: Jarren Benton]
Ride around in my side of town
I'm Whitney Houston and Bobby Brown
4AM and it's going down
No one make a move and no one make a sound, 'bout to
Get it, get it, get it, get it, get it, get it
Get it, get it, get it, get it, get it, get it
All day gon' hit it, I'm 'bout to
Get it, get it, get it, get it, get it, get it
Get it, get it, get it, get it, get it, get it
All day, all night, nigga I'mma get it
(Jenkins!)

[Verse 3: Elz Jenkins]
Young nigga needed money so a nigga went and got it
Trapping hard then I'm trapping hard, still I went to college
Time it hard, nigga you wouldn't try, what you do for profit?
Grabbing the K with the silencer, I hope you do the knowledge
Kicking, going through the back, yea
Plan on let a nigga go? No
Tell them [?] say, yea
Time up, hit the door, go
Black gun, money bag, yea
Roll with plenty niggas, shot up plenty niggas
Tell them die then play it back, damn
Realest in the city, trillest in the city
Tell them niggas play it back, damn
We them niggas putting on
Ain't nobody put us on, no
Proud and independent, [?]
Riding 'round in my zone
Shoot a snitch like a camera man
On the [?] roll
We ain't friends, niggas just scared to be enemies
Switch sides like crossfade, no friend of me
Sipping, sipping, like 2Pac, need Hennessy
Lord I'm a sinner, I do it again, you forgiving me?

[Chorus: Jarren Benton]
Ride around in my side of town
I'm Whitney Houston and Bobby Brown
4AM and it's going down
No one make a move and no one make a sound, 'bout to
Get it, get it, get it, get it, get it, get it
Get it, get it, get it, get it, get it, get it
All day gon' hit it, I'm 'bout to
Get it, get it, get it, get it, get it, get it
Get it, get it, get it, get it, get it, get it
All day, all night, nigga I'mma get it
