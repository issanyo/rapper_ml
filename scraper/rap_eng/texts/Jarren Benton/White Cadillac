[Hook]
Yeah, white Cadillac, Top off
White girls are ready to ride off
Yeah, on a spaceship of chrome
5-4-3-2-1 gone

I'm so outta here x2
I'm so so so so outta here
I'm so outta here
I'm so outta here
5-4-3-2-1 I'm gone

[Verse 1]
Live from the mind of a lunatic
Grew up on the east side Dope Boyz moving bricks
Me, I'm in the basement
Writing in my note pad
Where the hell is Andre?
I grew up with no dad
Mr. Benton so rad
You should take a photograph
I'm so outta here you see me soaring in my hovercraft
Y'all don't wanna fuck with that
Boy I'm like heroin
Welcome to my dope show
No I'm not Marilyn
They say I'm a dreamer
Looking at the stars
Never was concerned about the money or the cars
I just wanna rock mic
Living in the spotlight
Waking from a nightmare
Feeling something's not right
I can't wait to leave here
I swear I'm never looking back
Jarren on the book it rap
Talking niggas cooking crack
Living in the future
But on this one, yeah I took it back
White Cadillac, gotta love the way I'm looking at

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
The city sleeping on me like a Sealy Posturepedic
But knowing me, I'll probably pop their hearts out and eat it
Yeah
I'm so outta here
I'm so outta here
My girl worry she think her baby is acting weird
Afraid of losing me
She holding back tears
And when I make it I promise I'm coming back here
Better yet I send a (pack of beer?)
A rocketship, we dipping out of the atmosphere
Yesterday I was wearier tomorrow
Now me and your Momma slam in Cadillac Cargos
Living on a pull out not a dollar in my cargo's
Shit is all the same from Decatur to Key Largo
Yeah from misty hallways the white picket fences
Opportunity just keep the guards on the hinges
I bet they hate it when I'm up, up, on
5-4-3-2-1 gone

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
I'm an east side monster
Came from the bottom
I'm so outta here that I'm a mother fucking problem
I love hip-hop
I'm-a die rhyming
Levitate over niggas, I defy science
Im-a get rich one day
Or die trying
Niggas got lifes
Say they rather die frying
Momma coming home from a hard day crying
Why life to working a Vegas shes sighing
Would I die dressed tell her, Momma keep trying
Until we reach the mountaintop, keep climbing
Yeah
Writing like I'm scribbling my last words
Spit it like I'm spitting out my last verse
I'm so sick say I need to see a pastor
Wack nigga killing
Turning niggas into Casper
I say they hate it when I'm up, up, on
5-4-3-2-1 bitch gone

[Hook]
