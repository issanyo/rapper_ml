[Hook: In-Doe & A.T]
Hundreds go, get your weight up
We do it big, get your weight up
We do it big, get your weight up
We do it big, get your weight up
Hundreds go, get your weight up
We do it big, get your weight up
We do it big, get your weight up
We do it big, get your weight up

[Verse 1: A.T]
Lott'a green, codeine, caps and stems, DMT
Ain't my thing but the OC make you feel so good, make you OD
Cocaine by the oz, getting fucked up to the whole key
The American dream or OG
On a mission but they know me
Loud as fuck, make the speakers bleed
See what we're sayin' in 7D
Tryin to stay off the fuckin' street
With In-Doe and a pound of weed
Gone, sippin' on
Fat booty chick that I'm grippin' on
Tried to get it in with the Adderall
Then the ecstasy wouldn't matter at all
Gone, trippin'
That's how we're livin'
MJ like a motherfucker
We ain't even seen pimpin'
Missed the L, my wholesale
Like I'm a couple mutherfuckin' [?]
Gonna go chill in a hotel
And the whole damn time I'ma smoke well

[Hook]

[Verse 2: In-Doe]
I roll up, I hop out
I roll up, I smoke out
Niggas gon' run they mouth
Bitches gon' use they mouth
In and out, in and out
When I come, bring a cloud
Makin' money, money piles
Makin' money, fuck a pound
Got kilos, amigo
They leak though, Bandito
Make movies, Tarantino
Do it big, big, big, Gambino
I pour up to black out
We squad up, that mac out
We ball out, we stack [?]
We low-key, no trap-house
In and out, in and out
Overstates, puffin' loud
Rippin' crowds
New ass-holes get lassoed when we tear it down (Goldyard)
Enough with the games, We smokin' up planes
They keepin' it plain, we keep it creative
We been to Decatur with drugs on our brains

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Jarren Benton]
Yeah, I'm on a Jedi mind trip
Last night had your hoe blowin' my dick
Act up nigga, nigga's open my shit
Pop the trunk, leave a nigga brain blown in this bitch
Sippin' on Schlitz malt liquor, thoughts sicker
Telepathic pimp, I could talk with ya'
Have a hoe selling pussy
Spit game to your mama next week
Put her out then I walk with ya'
Walk in them stores
High as fuck, feel like I'm walking on mars
Tan ass boots, get to poppin' these bars
I'll rip the fucking roof off the top of your car
Yea, come in brass knuckle bitten'
I'll saulder my semi get the [?]
Smoke a 'gar, singin', finger flickin' ash on my linen
If the pussy ripe then you can have the cash in my denim
Yeah, fuck hip-hop, got two kids hoe, need big guap
Remember when I couldn't afford the shit I bit lost
Now I'm tryn'a put stones in my fuckin' wristwatch
Semi-automatic when this shit gets hot
Hatin' ass niggas die slow, Kid Rock
Fuck ya'll, lick cock, Albert Hitchcock
1-2 to the eye, tic-toc don't stop

[Hook]
