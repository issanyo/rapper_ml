[Intro: milo]
I was baptized in a Walmart branded Kiddie-pool

[Verse 1: milo]
There's no more masks to wear
My father stares in my eyes only to see what I've stashed in there
Buffering lies, a particularly covetous guy
Finger-fucks the sky and asks for more
I am content with first base and a staggering birthrate of first-mates
Our Sherpa cannot commit a single mistake
Your favorite rapper is mealymouthed
My home studio is piecemeal
It's supper time in Springfield
This ornamental vest is lacking in pieces of flair
At Old Country Buffet on a Wednesday
And Jesus is there ignoring the sneeze guard
My Patronus is a steam car
Trying to reach whatever level Ween are
Wrote a rap song I couldn't translate to my white friends
An infinite loop of MF DOOM muttering "Aight then"

Sounds like somebody has a case of the Mondays

[Bridge: milo]
I was baptized in a Walmart branded Kiddie-pool
I was baptized in a Target branded Kiddie-pool
I was baptized in a K-Mart branded Kiddie-pool
By an anemic sorceress who's drowning under a hidden moon

[Verse 2: milo]
Guy Fieri eats nigga toes
He doesn't listen to Sigur Ros
I don't want to know about your niche goals or read your Tumblr dedicated to fitspo
I'd rather dance in sandals on tip-toe
Pantsless on skid row
Panting, screaming flip-mode
Find me brewing mint tea with old fogies
Blessing a meal of kimchi with old hoagies
Who wrote his thesis using the one black man emogi
Rap game Mowgli with a nosebleed
Who had the courage to keep on hoping
Who had the courage to keep on hoping
