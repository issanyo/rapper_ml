[Intro]
I wanna talk some shit
I'm so old, I'm so old
I remember, I can recall (you know?)
I'm so old I remember
Memories colliding now, I remember
I can recall

[Verse 1: Scallops Hotel]
I remember three-years-old
86th and Ada, in Ruby's kitchen
Now I drop gems, my rubies glisten
I remember at least seven rap names ago
When my only light was indigo, that's a frail rainbow
Then Cavalcade turned me red like a stained bowl
Post-binge of Flamin' Hot Cheetos
That's a rainy day, that's a rainy day
The poor man is ample with his needs
I recline under the Sword of Damocles
I would love to die doing this
I doubt you heard it from the druid's lips
Sink or swim, you could drown from these fluid quips
And I remember when he did
Got a Squirtle to commemorate
Don't come around talkin' 'bout your skills
You should demonstrate
Don't come around talkin' 'bout you hunt
Where's the dinner plate?
Don't come around talkin' 'bout you on
You been late
My god, you been late

[Verse 2: Scallops Hotel]
You ain't put me on with that Hegel talk
I'm posted on Craggled Rock with A Flock of Seagulls
My flock is regal, your Glock is see-through
You thought the X-Jet was innovativeâ€”
Remember that?
I'm a clumsy thinker, a mumbling in-betweener
I'm gambling on the zenith
Don't act surprised when they doubt you
Wrote the verse high at Western Union in my house shoes
I'm not a dummy
Convert the Blacks and Blues like Bobbi Humphrey
Nah-nah, I doubt you really seen 'em
Understand anxiety is the dizziness of freedom
Understand your own soul as an arboretum
Understand I would trade my entire fanbase
For one more handshake from Rob
VMware server redirects hate mail from God
And I'm lounging, black
And I'm lounging, black
And I'm lounging, black

[Outro]
You feel me, bruh?
Yeah, yeah, yes feel me, bruh
You feel me, bruh?
You feel me, bruh?
I say, you feel me, bruh?
I say, you feel me, bruh?
Cause it's filthy, bruh
Cause it's filthy, bruh
You feel me, bruh?
Do you feel me, bruh?
Is it filthy, bruh?
Can you feel me, bruh?
And I ask again, and I ask again
