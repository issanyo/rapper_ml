[Intro: milo]

(Au Revoir)

Uh-uh
I haven't forgotten
I couldn't forget
I remember my oaths
I remember my duties
I haven't forgotten my loyalties

[Verse 1: milo]
Lookie here, it's my blind spirit dance
Learned it by the riverside, holding hands with Rosencrantz
You ask: where is Guildenstern?
On the other side of a long bridge I burned
He remains so patient and pious
Also pompous and probably going to die soon by gun fight
At high noon we gon' find your blood type
That's how I'd talk if I was a Deadwood character
Imma buy a pink Cadillac and blog Blue America
Drive my momma wherever she need to be at
Taking the corner slow
I was raised on Brother J, X Clan
I was always taught to pass my blessings to the next man
Stomping, walking in my big black boots
Stomping, walking in my big black boots
(Living off the earth eating birds and fruits)
(Living off the earth eating birds and fruits)

[Verse 2: milo]
The force of the winding path was sent tristen trip
The living myth in the physical
The young son of Bobby Digital with all wooden fingers
Prone to write a poem when the gloom lingers
Like I'll swear the gin
Might find an outback bearskin
Where the coarse air wimmering
Crack a Morse Code riddle quick
Of course the boy's all ready ready eat it hand full of mulberry berries
I'm forgetting something
I'm forgetting something
I'm forgetting something

[Verse 3: milo]
How he's so fluid conjuring poetics
Bud Powell with the fez screaming: Off with their heads!
(Who?) Bud Powell with the fez, nigga
Next he's tailored with the black keys
Ashy hands and ashy black knees
On eight chains of the oldest gold
Crowned with fresh picked marigolds, yes I'm very old
Stand in front, I'm only nine with the kasha in my right hand
