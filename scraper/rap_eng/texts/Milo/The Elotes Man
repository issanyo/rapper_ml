[Intro]

I'm positive that I can cure loneliness
My friends may be imaginary but they lack any phoniness
They lack any phoniness

[There are no real verses]

I'm in a field where the rapscallions frolic
My mind is a maze painted by Jackson Pollock.
I'll be the sorcerer lounging under the fig trees;
Lotus pose, meditation, please pardon my big knees
Big Bang Theory crash cymbals *BRRRAAAP*
Wild horses, broken reins there's no holding back
Trendy raps like mocha fraps and yoga mats
An abundance of smoke and mirrors, you shouldn't focus on that

A straight face is a great sign of anguish
Pondering free will and reading Fake Time and Language
Still waiting on my invite to the pitchfork music fest
I'll be dressed in an esoteric druid vest
Ryan Frost gave me a Diablo 3 beta key
Which was rap musics failed attempt to get away from me
Busy validating my heart's beat on a Kaoscillator
The perfect snack is a glass of cold milk and vanilla wafers

The optician with a monocle for your third eye
The news boy with the latest chronicles of the nerd guy

There is a man and he's pushing a cart [Hook 1]
Inside there are cobs of corn
And in my mind there are gobs of porn
And I push my heart on the same four wheels
I am the Elotes man (x2)

There is a man and he's pushing a cart [Hook 2]
Inside there are cobs of corn
And in my mind there are gobs of porn
And I push my heart on the same four wheels
I am the Elotes man (x3)

If Dave Chapelle ran for president I would vote twice
At illuminati circle jerk sessions I'm most nice
I slather corn in mayonnaise and other spices
Tricked my cart out as an extension of my being

YouTube buffering prevents my consciousness from streaming
You don't know depression until your inbox is empty
You complain about office space but I'm pushing my cubicle
Cranky cus' cayenne pepper's all up in my cuticles

I was hip-hop's primary soothsayer
Before I was this affluent corn cob purveyor

[Hook 1] (x2)

There is a man and he's pushing a cart
