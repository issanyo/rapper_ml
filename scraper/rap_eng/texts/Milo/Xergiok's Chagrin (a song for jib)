[Verse 1]
Dark times ingratiate, I scream "hello binge"
Everything is yellow tinged; I guess this dream has jaundice
Passed out red-faced just to see who could scream the longest
Found the secret answer only to learn it wasn't what I wanted
Now my head hurts and I don't know the passwords
I rooted my fingers in dead dirt to catch the last worms
The legion of shark-faced men with their daggers out
Couldn't approach the speeding zen of the blabbermouth
I listened to that folk band
Learned the chords to Old Man
Bought pounds of fair-trade coffee in lieu of roast ham
Built a secure fortress around all my insecurities
And bought a Brita filter to strip water of impurities

[Hook]
I scrubbed my palms of hot cheeto dust
I sang the ordination song for vito on the bus
I scrubbed my palms of hot cheeto dust
I sang the ordination song for vito on the bus

[Verse 2]
Grow a neckbeard just to shave it off again
Try harder to fit in with my girlfriend's friends
I need a restroom break
An excuse to sit on a dirty toilet listening to Neptune Estate
Fuck those white girls with Indian headdresses
I've been restless but never reckless
While all my friends got drunk I flipped poems for a per diem to buy hot lunch
Now my belly stays round, I know I barely been around

[Hook]
I scrubbed my palms of hot cheeto dust
I sang the ordination song for vito on the bus
I scrubbed my palms of hot cheeto dust
I sang the ordination song for vito on the bus

[Verse 2]
Draped in Hong Kong polyester, sang the wrong songs among the throngs of court jesters
I scribbled words on the walls of my mother's house
Post-it note aesthetics in lieu of bread crumbs trailed about
Then my tone deepened
But first my voice cracked
I had a banner but no courage found to hoist that
They came to every rap show, I tried to act nicer
But it was easier to hide in a corner and read Jack Spicer

[Outro]
Then your favorite rapper lets you down one more time
Then your favorite rapper lets you down one more time
Then your favorite rapper lets you down one more time
Then your favorite rapper lets you down one more time
