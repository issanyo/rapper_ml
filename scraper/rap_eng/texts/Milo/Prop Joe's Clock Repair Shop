[Verse 1]
I've got a proposition
You should stop and listen
Time is an inward intuition
You peek from the third
I gaze from my fourth eye
All things are known to me a priori
You're a slave to the newest
I ponder time travel reading David Lewis
Let me elaborate
A man like me bows to no magistrate
Rap is certainly impractical
Too lazy to generate a counterfactual
Existence itself is a pipe dream
Time for another bowl of ice cream
I think I need to pray
I was sobbing in line at the Chinese buffet
Chuch

[Hook]
I sat still in my Birkenstocks
Surrounded by broken clocks
And began to ponder what you could not
I sat still in my Birkenstocks
Surrounded by broken clocks
And began to ponder what you could not
I sat still in my Birkenstocks
Surrounded by broken clocks
And began to ponder what you could not
I sat still in my Birkenstocks
Surrounded by broken clocks
And began to ponder what you could not
Filth

[Verse 2]
I'm on YouTube searching ODB clips
Fools email me for Mr. Gyogi tips
I don't have the answers
Sat in the front pew, hands like a praying mantis
May God bless your stacks
I'm a walking tesseract
With a professor's swag
I'm nearly in my final form
I don't have to mine the internet for porn
I don't have to mine the internet anymore
Put flowers in my hair like Adrian Adonis
I don't really care my dude I'm pompous
Ch'yeah... burn
Ate the whole stash of senzu beans
Then I licked the platter clean
And proceed to construct your matter in a dream
The world is my idea
This axiom is self evident
I call upon myself as my only evidence
I created giraffes
Right before I gave myself a mustache

[Outro]
I think I need to pray
I was sobbing in line at the Chinese Buffet
Chuch
I think I need to pray
I was sobbing in line at the Chinese Buffet
