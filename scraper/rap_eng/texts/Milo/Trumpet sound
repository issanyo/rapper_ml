As a matter of fact...

Couldn't doubt it repping though it
Took about a second
'Cause we built it clandestine
And benefited from hand-me-down methods
That's time tested

The universe is mostly distance
The universe is mostly disinterest
There's an intruder in my interlude
State trooper subterfuge kept me a free man
Duende smuggler in the back of a minivan

This a pacifica
For your pacifist ass
To get a lick upon
For the sick bastards who feel no guilt
Scallops Hotel the house that Ro built
Is presently vacant
Check in vacant
And you will never check out
Check in vacant
And you will never check out
