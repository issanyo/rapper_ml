[Verse 1: milo]
A great swell of energy like a Hadron particle collider
You look like my fear of waterslides personified
Finding beauty big bee in a cornfield
If I'm phony now I can remember I was born real
Threw that self help jargon in my spam folder
Then set to explore the monster like Bram Stoker
Whereof one cannot speak thereof one must be silent
But I yawned and I burped and I passed gas loudly
