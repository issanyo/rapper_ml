[Intro: milo]
Yeah
Sovereign nose of your arrogant.. face
Sovereign nose of your arrogant.. face
One-two, yeah

[Verse: milo]
She play forte, I accompany pianissimo
Borges with a greasy flow, stained clothes
I hope you wasn’t needing those, the fit was like a cum rag
Bite like a thumbtack, rogue artificer
Art vizier slanging doo-riddled undies
Ro' Bundy with the Khmer Rouge bunting
Mala fide hunting
With a battle cry stunted, stole King Geedorah's mic
Celebrated with some sprinkles on a pizza slice
Ass whooped, niggas want that gadzooks
Like I'm Huey P. in Louis V at the eulogy, shit
Rory F. at the front desk streaming ebony love sets
Don’t look at my screen (screen, screen, screen)

[Coda: milo]
Temple in the green (green, green, green)
Scallops Hotel is the, Scallops Hotel is the – building
As in the process
I don’t give a fuck what you thought or thought less
Scallops Hotel is the building, four walls and a ceiling, shit
Scallops Hotel is the building (building, building, building)

[Outro: milo]
This beat is nice
This beat is nice
The mic sounds nice
Road sounds nice, shit
Temple in the green (green, green, green)
Ruby Yacht, Ruby Yacht, Ruby Yacht
Scallops Hotel
That's it
