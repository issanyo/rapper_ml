[Interlude]
Uh, RED WALL, Wahoo Monastery

[Verse 1: milo]
Sure the name is RED WALL, but you know it's Black Cannons
Walk the block with a bop like you verstehen black canon
A list of presidents 15th, like James Buchanan
Canoeing up the shit stream, found our meaning in the hazard
Two brothers like Dukes of Hazzard
Or is it two dukes like Dukes of Hazzard?
I suppose either is true, it doesn't matter
When two human beings form a brick wall
And all it reads is that your dick's small
I wanna redefine what stunting is
A snare drum failing is protecting us from nothingness
Outside the dark moon lunes
Inside and I'm the outspoken coon
Cool, who's about the break the golden rule?
Barter with my older self for a loyal mule

Pledge fidelity to any and all enemies
I will be vehemently opposed to your everything
If life were an arcade machine begging a quarter on the continue screen
It would not be good enough to continue continuing
And yet here i am continuing to continue
In a dream I thought I'd seen you
Beguiling an artifact
Waxing poetic bout the art of rap
Wearing a beatnik-style cap
And All-Star run flats, who was that?

Well they gave me this message

[Verse 2: Safari Al]
RED WALL
Don't presuppose a red place of a red home
Vaulting like Spalding balls do
An impromptu display of fortitude
The dim mak do mean we’re exporting you
Terror bitten and chewed, damn you
Not that you abandoned trenches and the work
But inheriting the legacy of the whole mess
Not down from hollenbeck
Not writing Hallmarks
Too much compressor, too much, too much autoparts
The recesses of my mind is where I mostly take my tantrums at
I would cry to bring the banter back if it left us
A handsome banshee and then some
Now I eat tortillas when I used to eat lefse
Gon' tell me how I lived messed up
It’s the best of mix
Where I come from people might fight about this

These things that you think are unimportant

[Outro: Safari Al]
