[Intro]
(Check Check)
It's the pitter patter of rain
It's the weather
It's the
It's the pitter patter of raindrops that
It's the pitter patter of raindrops that keeps me
I couldn't stop if I would
It's the pitter patter of raindrops on this

[Verse 1]
It's the pitter patter of raindrops on this steel hut
Reminds me of old Doom drums
We should remove the ceiling before the moon comes
Bobby Brown mirror dance
Convinced your soul hopefully works
Feeling like an errand boy sent by grocery clerks
It's the pitter patter of raindrops on this steel hut
Reminds me of little hands gripping heirloom tomatoes

(hm)

He rock that humble pocket symphony
When the clammer of dimes and pennies
Sounds like the most elegant of timpanis
Please discard used tissues and sympathies
In the same trash receptacle
A tad sceptical
Of well to dos
Helter Skelter, in modal jazz cues

You are the last emergency glowstick
Love is vague and probably useless
Coated in bile
Coda mala fide
There's a fly in the buttermilk
There's a fly in the buttermilk

[Chorus]
You know it's nice outside but I'd lower it by ten degrees
So I could throw my Timberland on and catch the Autumn breeze
You know it's nice outside but I'd lower it by ten degrees

No, I don't know this city well

[Verse 2]
No no
I don't know this city well
Yeah it's getting windy on this pedestal
I'm from the one black family from Rivendell
If I told you my old name you wouldn't pronounce it well
The ashy handed bandit with no scruples
A pupil of what's useful
Uncouth, and too cool, but always truthful
Yes it's him with uber hobo zen flow
Reddish elbow ganzo
Never on tiptoes in Timbs though

That bookish basket case
Has a crooked bastard's face
I'm not smart or dumb
You glorify acroment
Call sex hotlines in parseltongue
You don't get embarrassed when you fart in public
I'm selling art in Dublin
To a young Republican
Who suffers the impression that I'm under him
And he'll probably continue to suffer
That's unfortunate

You know it's

[Chorus]
You know it's nice outside but I'd lower it by ten degrees
So I could throw my Timberland on and catch the Autumn breeze
You know it's nice outside but I
I like it a little cooler

You know it's nice outside but I'd lower it by ten degrees
So I could throw my Timberland on and catch the Autumn breeze
You know it's nice outside but I
I like it a little cooler

You know it's nice outside but I'd lower it by ten degrees
So I could throw my Timberland on and catch the Autumn breeze
(It's the pitter patter of raindrops on this)
You know it's nice outside but I
I like it a little cooler

(I couldn't stop if I was)

You know it's nice outside but I'd lower it by ten degrees
So I could throw my Timberland on and catch the Autumn breeze
(It's the pitter patter of raindrops on this)
(It's the pitter patter of raindrops on this)
