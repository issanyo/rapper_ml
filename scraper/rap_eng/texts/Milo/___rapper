[Intro: Busdriver]
Yeah, one two
Uh, it's like this
Come on

[Verse 1: Busdriver]
Back in the days when I was a teenager
Had Myka 9 straight on a screensaver
Look exactly like I just smoked a green acre
Got that information like it was data

[Break: Busdriver]
One two, let's go, uh
One more time, I'll do it

[Verse 1 (cont'd): Busdriver]
I got the memoirs in the rental cars
Spray a homie just with a simple ten bar
Verse or two, I will curse your crew, from Leimert, fool
I hit them up with the two twisted fingers
I want to linger, the rap singer looks like Deborah Winger
Dead ringer, web slinger, dead up in the street, fool
On Crenshaw smoking menthols with Chu Chu
All you niggas get the juju, my name is like flow, Joe
You don't know bro, I'm from the Blowed dojo
You're so-so, fuck them niggas, they don't know bro
("Yeah, nigga, you just not new")
I said this shit with the language splice
When it come through, ha
You ain't a half a slice, from the afterlife
God, the hazard lights look exactly like twinkling stars
Wanna mingle with the bars, yo?
I look exactly like Grand Puba
They know that they got the bland doobah
All of you niggas don't know what to do, bruh, I am a rapper
Young whippersnapper, jive master
Always live on the master, a telecaster from Leimert bro
Los Angeles serve the niggas on the turf, though

[Interlude: Busdriver]
Yeah, you know what's up
One, two, uh
Kendrick and Milo, c'mon

[Chorus: milo & Busdriver]
I'm on my new shit
I'm on my new shit
I'm on my new shit
I'm on new shit
I'm on my cruise ship
I'm on my cruise ship

[Verse 2: Milo]
And each week it's another nigga killed
Imported bits of eloquence direct from Margaritaville
Never imagined Blade Runner as an idyllic film
And the Pokemon GO when the Pokemon GO
When the Pokemon GO
On Potrero Hill bent pole head under firmament
Guess I'll just scat off axis
Arrogant as ever while I rattle off my praxis
I got these nectarines from Ganymede
So live again, dueling with insignificance
Whatever it takes to whittle at the hours
A never ending game of padiddle with these cowards
Like, why don't you take your clothes off?
Argus with 100 eyes, how he harkened to another time

[Coda: milo]
And for following every rule, all you received was applause
And for following every rule, all you received was applause
And for following every rule, all you received was applause
And for following every rule, all you received was applause
And for following every rule, all you received was applause
And for following every rule, all you received was applause
