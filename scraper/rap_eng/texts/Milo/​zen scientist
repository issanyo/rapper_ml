[Intro]
Well there seem to be some misconceptions
There seem to, there seem
I don’t think that you understand
There seem… seemingly a misconception here

[Verse 1]
It’s him who wrote the Tao of the pessimist
As thespians maneuver through the now and its messiness
I’ve grown weary of their kindnesses
The addled Zen scientist with the inwardly infinite capacity for  mindfulness
This is a kite shield to protect you from complacency
I stand adjacent to the vagrancy, no vacancy
Out in the street with palms and guns, the Argo of the ergonauts
It’s enough to send kisses down your arm like Gomez
How he dazzled with bafflegab
Sisyphus surmounts the aggro crag
Cantillating grace and they can't keep my pace
(and they can't keep my pace)

[Hook]
The soul is fly
I’m in the new zone
I’ve decided my point of view
I have decided my point of view
This earth I respect, her subtle mood swings
Summer Winter Spring Fall for you

[Verse 2]
At the back of a long line like always
In the recesses receding
This lawn chair creaks when I’m leaning
The microcosm between velour and velvet
When the ache becomes a Kaiser helmet
Cc me when you supersize your intentions
Ill be in the frozen food aisle until then
It’s a lead lid on this pillbox
I plan on living until the bills stop
Budding curmudgeon with cudgel bludgeon the kerfuffle of the welterweight
That’s understated

[Bridge]
I stay indoors
I stay indoors
I stay indoors

[Verse 3]
We broke so its lawn chairs, long stares
Gloomy, never forlorn
Learn the old forms; honor the old gods via iPod
Don’t stop the body rock, I have decided in good faith to let my soul fly
Mr. Yuk lets his soul fly
Ken Saro-Wiwa let’s his soul fly
Mister, uh, Ken Ford has been known to let his soul fly
I know DJ syndicate let’s his soul fly
The Kleenerz are so fly
Guantanamo bosh lets his soul fly
Jacob Bluefinger well I bet he lets his soul fly
Dugan Nash been known to let his soul fly
Black Orpheus I’m sure he lets his soul fly
That boy, Scipio he lets his soul fly
Of course the wise owl himself, he lets his soul fly
Who was once called Flows-A-Million, yes he’s so fly
