I thought my elders came for me, they said I stunk
But I was drunk off of elderberry tea
I, I, I
I thought my elders came for me, they said I stunk
But I was drunk off of elderberry tea
I, I, I
I thought my elders came for me, they said I stunk
But I was drunk off of elderberry tea
I, I, I

A loser with a winning score
You pitched a tent indoors
I tried to embue this moment with meaning, like a trite Sophomore
But my attempts were all clumsy
I opened my mouth and said that dumbly, I said that dumb thing

I got these stupid tattoos
To remind me of past life snafus
That left me black and blue, bruised
They still tingle when on the receiving end of bad news
I'm on the receiving end of bad news

I hope that you're not mad at me
I felt the rainbow's gravity
You can pass the dandelion wine
I'm not next in line
I'm next to resign myself infinitely
Binge eat secretly
Then watch 'Twin Peaks' for weeks until my armpits reek

I went to the thrift store and bought myself a trophy
Yes I'm lonely
To be forewarned is to be forearmed
I've been etching barcodes in my forearms
But that's strictly off the record
I used to try to hide under my father's dresser
Then that shit collapsed and crushed my back
I got the scars to show it
If I looked in the mirror I'd hardly know
I got a buzz from all this Mountain Dew
I can be a fountain too

I thought my elders came for me, they said I stunk
But I was drunk off of elderberry tea
I, I, I
I thought my elders came for me, they said I stunk
But I was drunk off of elderberry tea
I, I, I
I thought my elders came for me, they said I stunk
But I was drunk off of elderberry tea
I, I, I
