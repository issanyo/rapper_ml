But what are my three wishes?
What are my three wishes?

[Elucid]
Youngblood
What up, champ?
Nostrum

Nostrum Grocers

[Verse 1: Elucid]
I'm not as far from the junction
Where the planes hang low
And if you feel a way, you oughta make it known
Head, shoulders, knees, and toes
What are those
I spend what I sweat for on these second hand clothes
That Freaknik 95' tee
Can't break up the rhyme scheme
The color of this flow is lime green
Bob weave fabric pattern trigger memory
I go willingly
NGs got the remedy
How'd it feel when the first called you a god?
I speak from where I saw a cop bullet lodge
What does a world without pigs look like?
New myths, who lives, who dies
Who shifts, who thrives
No time, I got loose to slip inside
Inner eye guide, never the right time
Do it now!
Those are just words from a guy with a bad haircut
I don't often exercise my tear ducts
But still want to complicate the narrative (narrative)
Hawking tickets to a play of the oppressed
And the caress of supremacy
For whosoever believes
I don't want to mislead you
I love how you love me
I never did it how we do
How we do

Yeah yeah

[Verse 2: milo]
Once more how Autumn is liberal with acorn
My favorite Libra by the cellar door
I feel safe again
He grab that microphone gizmo how Delroy Lindo cup the back of his son's head
Romeo must die with that romantic diatribe
See we're royal, air full of tea tree oil
I'll define cleanliness
Sparring with an umbrian emptiness, it repeats
Sparring with an umbrian emptiness, it repeats
Bluffing with my other fist
Yo, just bluffing with my other fist
I rap in firm opposition
Pafko takes the wall
Rap in firm opposition
Pafko takes the wall
