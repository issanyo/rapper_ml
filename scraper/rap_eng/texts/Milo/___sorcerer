[Intro]
Ruby Yacht for ever n' ever n' ever n' ever n' ever n' ever n' ever n' ever n' ever n' ever, amin...

[Verse 1]
Wipe me down with celerity
Hold myself with alacrity
These are careful notes of every lack in me
I took while jacobins tried to tax my seed
College was rote Zionism
These scars come with broke fire pistols
Renaissance dunce
Bus of blunders tracing a fault line
Trying to defend my distance
Trying to defend my distance
Tried to fend my distance
Big ass painting of myself like I'm Lonnie Liston
The auto-tune clamor of modernity
On auto-pilot for an eternity
She play Shirley Scott and I'm Turrentine
Feel my spirit bugging, but it's weltschmerz
Your soul was cussin' that felt hearse
This Robitussin is for the wet nurse
Karl Popper
Sweating by that hot poker, fuck that
You should've been a stockbroker, fuck that
Rappers look like rock smokers, fuck that
At the bottom of a well and I'm screaming, "There's still more"
I gripped a microphone like I'm John Gilmore
Pilot pulpit as a star-fighter, and the consequences can buffer

[Chorus]
I flourish in the lag time, I, flourish in the lag time, I
Flourish in the lag time, I, flourish in the lag time, I
Flourish in the lag time, I flourish in the lag time
Behind stalactites of my mind, I flourish in the lag time, I
Flourish in the lag time, I, flourish in the lag time, I
Flourish in the lag time, I, flourish in the lag time
While suffering was normalized, I flourished in the lag time, I
Flourished in the lag time, flourished in the lag time
When suffering was normalized, I, flourished in the lag time
Lag time
And the stalactites in the back of my mind
When suffering was normalized, I flourished in the lag time

[Outro]
(muffled voices)
(laughter)
Shit... Shit
Oh yeah, this is dope
