[Everything: milo]
Sometimes I walk home with a scarf on my face
I don't have leprosy but I'm feeling out of place
I'm not really much of a small talker
Made a Faustian bargain with a group of ball bloggers
I'm all over your plasma screen
And I'm so confused, is this a lucid dream?
I can stare at a Rothko painting
With my mind's eye when I'm at Shopko paying

Too much money for Amy's Chili in the green can
Fear is silly and I don't need a wing man
I don't wear a beaded rosary
An effective form of therapy is shopping for groceries

I'm paraphrasing Freud when I say that
I maybe ought to make much noise when I play back
These raps I made with a tape dispenser and 8-track
March 3rd: I went a whole day without crying
And I wrote it in my dairy
I nearly broke my mental cargo vessel pondering piety
I pressed my face against the drab, cold tiles
Whenever I get lost in the cat toy aisle

On the verge of a panic attack
I brought myself to the grocery store
On the verge of a nervous breakdown
I brought myself to the grocery store
On the verge of a panic attack
I brought myself to the grocery store
On the verge of a nervous breakdown
I brought myself to the grocery store

I'm not trying to say I don't know up from down
But somehow my internal thermometer doesn't function now
I was so afraid to be outrageous
Then I meditated under an awning in Las Vegas
And led a small rebellion of Pawn Stars and lost ravers
From mars directly to the nearest cost saver

On the verge of a panic attack
I brought myself to the grocery store
On the verge of a nervous breakdown
I brought myself to the grocery store
On the verge of a panic attack
I brought myself to the grocery store
On the verge of a nervous breakdown
I brought myself to the grocery store
