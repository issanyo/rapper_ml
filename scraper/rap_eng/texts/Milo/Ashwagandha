[Verse 1: milo and Elucid]
The time is now
To stretch your mind to it’s maximum peak
To know everything
To know every inch of your urge

Ro give a fuck to break ice
Out front shaking skittles like dice
Y’all sell sprockets, I clown niggas like Affion Crockett
Flying bicycle kick, up an octave
Poetic license made obnoxious
In the robe of a legendary Unixtarian down
Somebody else’s idea
As if words could pierce tunic
Of someone else’s world
Is not my idea of things as they
Are (Ey)

[Chorus: milo and Elucid]
Somebody else’s idea
Of someone else’s world
Is not my idea of things as they
Are

Somebody else’s idea
Of someone else’s world
Is not my idea of things as they
Are

Somebody else’s idea
Of someone else’s world
Is not my idea of things as they
Are

Somebody else’s idea
Of someone else’s world
Is not my idea of things as they
Are

Somebody else’s idea
Of someone else’s—
World, world
