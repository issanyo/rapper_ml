[Intro]
Reading Nausea in an orange tent
Make mental note "first time feeling a foreign sense"
I'm going to ask my heroes about their debts today
And which ones exactly they've left unpaid

[Bridge]
This is a diagram about that one time
This is a diagram about that one time

[Chorus]
Reading Nausea in a tent with a girl named Sasha and I'm bent
You should ask your nigga about his debts
Reading Nausea in a tent with a girl named Sasha and I'm bent
You should ask your nigga about his debts

[Bridge]
This is a diagram about that one time
This is a diagram about that one time

[Verse 1]
Repeated listens of Mike Ladd's Nostalgialator
Coincide with preference to have been born nower than later
It's the lesser, not the greater, that savors any type of power
Dumb niggas forgot their mathematics
Weak rappers are asthmatics
Bumpkin savages rap on vocal tracks
Peace

[Interlude]
But it's back to the metaphysics
Flash half a rhythm
And decapitate a Metacritic God
But it's back to the metaphysics
Flash half a rhythm
And decapitate a Metacritic God
But it's back to the metaphysics
Flash half a rhythm
And decapitate a Metacritic God
But it's back to the metaphysics
Flash half a rhythm
And decapitate a Metacritic God

[Verse 2]
Showboat rappers get stood up in their studio
I heard Wal-Mart signed Jason Derulo
Then dropped him cause he couldn't sell crew socks
And refused to adopt the umlaut
That's when I flashed an odd smile
And said I only wear argyle
Playing Pile in a smart car
Dummy thinks he's artsy
I only wear chartreuse when I'm boxing
Noble hawk-eye, but mumble like I'm pea-brained
Usually identified by the ghee stain
Moved to California just to mispronounce the weed strains
Stupid

[Outro]
(How did that one sound?)
