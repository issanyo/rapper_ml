[Verse 1]
I found myself in the same place
Aimlessly wandering systemic violence with amazing grace
On my second life like Lazarus
Or John the Baptist, I remember granny read that passage with bated breath
I duel life most comfortably on the razor's edge
You will never hear anyone from my family is underfed
I brought the gun to the knife fight for wonderbread
Keep yo hero in a cave like a cyclops
But the crowd prefer that mindrot
I just spit that eyedrop
A noob with a jaw full of gems for your Saibot
Seto Kaiba with a high top, check it
It surrounds me like the lovely scent of autumn
Speaking coyly to my honeydip in Gotham like
"I am prepared to commit wickedness so you might retain your shine"

[Verse 2]
Pigeon-toed with a stutter step
Known to hide a rapper's skull in the cupboard with the china set
Scarf a green jellybean, hoping to parse the meaning in all things
Couldn't find parking for the part king of the darklings
Too weary of the praise that art bring
Juggle with my organs
Manifest self under a cloak of self-importance
Use stool sheets as discreet rugs
Join internet group cool freaks wikipedia club
Feel ambivalence about existence, but never your
Piss-poor pension to disrupt systems and do chores
Beat box on beat
This particular truth's BPM is... five
Neither healer nor wizard
Tighten the noose at the stool-kicker
We have one that makes a necessity out of virtue
Who among us is not among us?
