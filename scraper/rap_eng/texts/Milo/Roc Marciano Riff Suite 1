[Intro]
I complete forgot the cool part
It's lost on me now

[Verse]
Humble and meek
I don't mean to be soo weak, I don't mean to be soo brittle
Always Malcolm X, never once Malcolm Little
Acquire more riddles to spit more spittle
So these kids can fact check
Yo, they twiddling their thumbs
This is no fun if you expect me to out smart you
I've got my doubts dude, I don't know what art means
I think I brought to life a dark thing
That should've remained hidden in your subconscious
I'm pompous, big fucking ego means I am pure evil
And I know this, nontheless trying to grow to be a lotus
Don't even have to be flying, just existing
Just existing, don't even have to be flying, just existing
Just breathing, just feeling this moment
Letting it vibrate me in the most sincere way
I wanna decay right on time
I wanna decay right on time, right when I'm suppose to go
I know where the path leads, fuck

[Outro]
And you do a little dance down by the cross roads
And you do a two step and  say what up though?
My mama calls me Ro
My father calls me Ro
My sister calls me Ro
But you, you will use no name, you won't know my name
