[Verse 1]
We got our first apartment and spent six months in the front room laughing
Darkness was attractive
Dust in the cabinets cause we could only afford paper plates, no napkins
Your mother approaching us, the repercussions of life, no ramekins

I learned to be a man again
I learned to be a mannequin
I learned to be a man again

[Verse 2]
In my mind I’m the corduroy coon prince
From the outside I'm more like a really dumb doofus
Rap albums made my face expand like lupus
Quit college, I never made it to a senior student
Because I had a dangerous secret like Remus Lupin
That means Imma scary fuckin’ werewolf
Swear to god I nearly blew my brains out on Tuesday
Safari Al taught me how to hide it like a toupee
Now I’m eating Domino's with the lads on a Thursday
It’s Hellfyre til I’m dead
That’s not per se

[Verse 3]
Listen to Mike Eagle’s dishes
When I know I’m gonna feel weird
Because I can’t call him up
Just to say I feel weird
Family dollars pots and pans rust too fast
Asking if I can borrow his preamp and other do dads

“Hey Mike, Rory here…calling about that preamp again”

There were seventeen days
Where I only read Jean Genet
And before bed I only watched Office Space
That was a polarizing experience
Where do I go to be notarized as delirious

Tall and thin built like a NFL punter
Couldn’t afford cover art by Clementine Hunter, my nigga
Don't bet you're passing
Type of dude to beat you with a sculpture of Fletcher, Magnum
Point out how your aesthetic is totally lacking

[Interlude]
See what you need to understand of Kant’s notion of the sublime is that there needs to be an element of clear and present danger
Something so beautiful it could kill you
Like if Kim Kardashian were to smother the life out of you with her enormous butt cheeks
That would be a truly sublime experience

[Hook]
I know I made a mess , it’s time to pick-up sticks (x4)
I know I made a (x2)

(x2)
You can’t tell me why (x3)
Cause you never fuckin’ knew

[Bridge x2]
This is an alcove
This is an outpost
This is a village in a poplar grove
This is an imaginary place
This is the room with the Wolfmother wallpaper

[Outro]
We will not tolerate
Beating, lynching, burning, whipping, pillaging, torturing
Mass murdering of blacks
We are not your o-r-d-i-n-a-r-y r-a-p-p-e-r n-i-g-g-e-r-s
On our chest is wickedness
The Press is telling us lies
We will not tolerate
White men rape black men
Black men take it upon chopping up bones
Smothering them in plastic
Dipping their head in acid
Wondering if Dommer Dies
We will not tolerate
Daryl Gates, hates, beats blacks
Creates mistakes
False facts, fuck that
Getting my gat from under my hat
Surprise, wait, don’t wait
Anticipate fate liberate state of mind
Serve millimeter nines
We’re reaching out so we can feel the blind
Here it’s clear
We will not tolerate...fear
