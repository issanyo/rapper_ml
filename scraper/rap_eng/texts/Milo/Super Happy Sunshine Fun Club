[Verse 1: Milo]
With these clever raps I could probably summon a rainbow
But it'd get awfully lonely without someone's hand to hold
Let's go galloping in mythical great big fields
We'll see what all our constrictive efforts have to yield
We can form like Voltron just as two rapping superheroes
In tight tight spandex who cares if they call us weirdos
We'll form a softcore super rapping super clique
The name Super Happy Sunshine Fun Club ought to stick
We'll have more fans than Justin Bieber
And we'll overload vans full of lust and beaver
On our cross-country tour with Brian Bell from Weezer
But uh, just in case I get nervous on stage
And I hold your hand can you please not call me "gay"?
Because that's one: offensive, and two: very untrue
And think of all the cool hip-hop favours I've done for you
Follow my lead on this upcoming dance break
And it'll be totally awesome cause we have a secret handshake
With luck our fan girls can start an earthquake
Maybe Nick Jonas will tell me my flows are first-rate
Or I'll get lucky and he'll kiss on the first date, uh wait!

[Hook]
We're two very heterosexual rap pals
Our constant insistence on how good the other is
Makes you wonder if we believe anything we're saying
Or if this is our attempt to avoid hip-hop's gay hazing
We're two very heterosexual rap pals
Our constant insistence on how good the other is
Makes you wonder if we believe anything we're saying
Or if this is our attempt to avoid hip-hop's gay hazing

[Verse 2: Safari Al]
He's the one they write about in every tale of folklore
And it's so fricking awesome I can call him my bro
We pay for everything in serenades and sixpences
And finish each others sentences in lucha libre leotards
That are much too small to actually fit
But we both agree they make our muscles look bigger
And we're both content without salaries that got six figures
Pulling triggers on our jetpacks shooting sunbeams
We're the quirkiest couple that you have ever seen
Got an ongoing competition of moustache size
And frequently offer the community free moustache rides
You must ask right, how we can control each others pride (we don't)
[?]
Sitting in our chairs they see us wielding super-soakers
As we host a wet t-shirt contest for all the women nerds
Who have been waiting eons for Diablo 3 to emerge

[Hook]
We're two very heterosexual rap pals
Our constant insistence on how good the other is
Makes you wonder if we believe anything we're saying
Or if this is our attempt to avoid hip-hop's gay hazing
We're two very heterosexual rap pals
Our constant insistence on how good the other is
Makes you wonder if we believe anything we're saying
Or if this is our attempt to avoid hip-hop's gay hazing

[Outro]
Shame on rappers who perpetuate negative stereotypes and homophobia and things like that
Y'all some damn fools
Omar Little's probably going to devour you
Bye bye
