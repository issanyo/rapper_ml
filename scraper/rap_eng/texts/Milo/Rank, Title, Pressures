[Intro: milo]
Woooooooo!
Scallops Hotel, yeah

[Refrain: milo]
Sovereign nose on my arrogant— ayy
Sovereign nose on my arrogant— ayy
Sovereign nose on my arrogant— pow pow

[Verse: milo]
Niggas buckled under titles
Atop the Scallops Hotel was rose sniping rivals
Plenty niggas folded under rank
Too shook to bet the pot when a life’s holdings was at stake, yeah
Plenty more crumbled under pressure
No key to the scriptures, I say peace with two fingers
To the chorus of glue sniffers who first outline this indefinite wobble
A blues for mister Charlie is a refusal to grovel
Saboteur, engineer, very best with the pen and pad
Found your shit unacceptable like I was Lemongrab
Did a jig for emphasis, the nigga looked indigent
Feasting on figs in the city center
Mugen, true nen, ruby as a teeny ember (yeah)
True nen, ruby as a teeny amber, mugen
It was infinite

[Refrain: milo]
Mmm, sovereign nose on your arrogant—
Sovereign nose on your arrogant—
Sovereign nose on your arrogant face, face
Sovereign nose on your arrogant—
Sovereign nose on your arrogant—
Sovereign nose on your arrogant face, face, face

[Outro: milo]
Plenty niggas folded under titles, yeah
Plenty niggas folded under rank, yeah
Plenty more crumbled under pressure, uh
Plenty more is lost in the— ayy
In the valley of, I say, despair
In the valley of, I say, despair
In the valley of, I say, despair
