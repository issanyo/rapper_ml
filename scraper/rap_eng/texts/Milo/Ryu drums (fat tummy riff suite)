[Intro: milo]
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Okay, this a fucking hit and run
Okay, yeah

[Verse: milo]
Mise en scène, I've never hit the creatine
Ain't no muscles big enough to stop the guillotine
Reckoning as an HD, vectoring
Gadgets need Inspector-ing, or spit it like a lecturing, festering
Circle, square, fade, clouds a purple gray
The workings of a thankless day
Non-sense like Motorola and Escalade
I'm never hopeless, I wrote this with a fat tummy, scat funny
And break dance lovely like my goose egg runny
More than proficient, adept, more than proficient, adept
Remember when Al was spitting Windswept
More than proficient, adept
Implication of an invisible third, a willingness
Delicate circuitry somnambulates
This Y-Blade and V-Spartan had the makings
Of an oath in the peach garden
Shit, who am I?
Suppose I'm Lupe on a two-way puffing reckless
Nothing claimed, nothing tested
Snare calibrated to pop your double breasted
I stay well-breastfed

[Coda: milo]
This is how we built the— Brick by, yeah
This is how we built the— Brick by brick
This is how we built the— Brick by brick
Scallops Hotel is the building
