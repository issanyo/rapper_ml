[Hook: milo]
It's a bounce pass, nigga, have faith in the follow-through
Why your healer on crutches like Isaac of Uluru?
I stay with a cape in that lightning like Dooku
It's a bounce pass, nigga, have faith in the follow-through
Why your healer on crutches like Isaac of Uluru?
I stay with a cape in that lightning like Dooku

[Verse 1: milo]
It's the corduroy coon prince with two cent
That cost ten racks
Made a fortune off the empath
Couldn't bargain that art jargon
Not a fart with no pardons
Harken with nothing guarded
Greatness is to act with no security
Your whole spam was a blur to me
Y'all rap with no urgency and exit stage left urgently
Spectre is Sinestra
I'm in your city by vesper
With the '98 Gewehr
Nostrum Grocers spawn connoisseurs of machetes and levers
Of pullies and levers of bullish endeavors
Of black brilliance
Y'all lack resilience and it show
Y'all lack resilience and it...
Y'all lack resilience and it show

[Hook: milo]
It's a bounce pass, nigga, have faith in the follow-through
Why your healer on crutches like Isaac of Uluru?
I stay with a cape in that lightning like Dooku
It's a bounce pass, have faith in the follow-through
Why your healer on crutches like Isaac of Uluru?
I stay with a cape in that lightning, in that lightning, in that lightning

[Verse 2: Elucid]
Y'all can't rock me out like me
Highkey, time 3 with the light V
Skyseat over himey town
Wipe me down
Ride around shining
Revelation remind us
Hesitation is a virus within Godmode
Trace our blicky on the console, gone gonzo
Bakan tree grows in the basement
Spitshine my spaceship
Future ancient, in elder's good graces
Haste or not, my feet toward destruction
If we mustn't, we muss it
Bust it wide open, bent but not broken
They dragged Stokely cross the hospital floor and he sang
"I'mma, I'mma tell God how you treat me!"
New negro poet USA, we know the way
Crazy baldhead razor fade, awake and praise the day

[Hook: milo and Elucid]
