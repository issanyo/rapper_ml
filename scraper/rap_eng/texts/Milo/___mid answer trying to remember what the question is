[Intro]
Let’s do it, bubba, yeah, yeah, one, two
Yeah, yeah, Black Orpheus, okay, yo, okay

[Verse 1]
Huckleberry Hound turned futanari specialist
Mid-answer trying to remember what the question is
Shamika’s son coddiwompling, body rocking
Convert toxin while keeping the party hopping
Dropping science, they copping stock options
There go Cara baby daddy, heard that nigga very crabby
Always pontificating with white boys ‘bout community
Who is he but a charlatan braggart?
The nigga’s an actor, non-factor, underground hip hop miasma
Loud weirdos live off soliciting plasma
I gasp, my breath reek of herb and stewed tomatoes
Clanging ladles, I laugh, darting through kitchens
Great calamitous racket, on a mission
Airing my own dirty laundry, psalm is palm read
When I lay in bed, it feel like the ocean is on me
Ruby’s great grandbaby ducking familial trauma in the Obama era
Karma era, fear kept me awake in class, I
Can’t afford stupidity, and they assume I wrote it to impress they ass
Dirty glasses, long toenails, oh well
He's Boogie's pops, who earned his sovereignty off of how the loogie drop

[Bridge]
And the Ruby Yacht rock, rock on, one, two
And the Ruby Yacht rock, rock on, uh huh
And the Ruby Yacht rock, rock on, one, two
And the Ruby Yacht rock, rock on, uh huh

[Verse 2]
That’s Marilyn’s grand boy communicating with spirits
Derelict appearance, myriad pablum, impeccable delirium
Know the delivery left me wanting, haunting me like bad ideas ad absurdum
Dash of worm tongue, slipping immorality behind high skill
Saga entitled “Up from Blytheville”
I’m just strutting in that old preacher’s footsteps with a compass
Whittled from anxiety, maybe some people shouldn’t be part of s-s-society
It’s a crapshoot tryna rap with Lee’s nephew
That niggas’s chemicals need balancing
You know life’s all about that balancing
You know life’s all about that balancing

[Outro]
Peace to Randal Bravery
