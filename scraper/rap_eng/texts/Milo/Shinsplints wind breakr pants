[Intro]
Black Orpheus
Black Orpheus
Him who has the filthy fifths
Black Orpheus
Scallops Hotel
Check, check, one, two
Yeah, yeah
Check, one, two
Yeah, yeah
Check, one, two
I mean, yeah
Straight out of Soulfolks
Straight out of Soulfolks
Here we go, yeah

[Verse 1]
Same motherfuckers wanna get lentiginous
Run a mile and get shin splits
I ain't really concerned with it
I just wanna make them earn it
Sure you wasn't trafficking
But might take a charge for furnishing
I only believe in what allows for my flourishing
Which certainly isn't law enforcement
Reality divorces itself from spectacle
Bespectacled hecklers, screaming for Hector
With spear in hand, mirror stance
I'm aware you think it's just a dance
And my ancestors giggle
Wouldn't bet you a Manchester nickle
Hooligan anthem, making people use Google at random
I'ma open my own library
Soon as I get home from shitting on these rappers
Skipping stones, flipping poems and the hereafter
As my flesh hold fiascos, misery in tax codes
Brackets, zips, ash trays, hatchets
I'm sure it's all written in the book, hidden in the hook
Unfortunately I didn’t write one of those
Unfortunately I didn’t write one of those

[Verse 2]
You should see my sons dimples, hear his accent
He has no conception of past tense, that’s inspiring
Give me expression of where I’m heading
Yes, I’m betting now my masterpiece isn’t this song
But I dropped the 'G'
Posturing in German philosophy for an older truth
My destiny remains in phone booths
And should they be eradicated I will hold you to that
Sunset promise of building wicker furniture
He whispered "people liked you when you were nervouser"
But I pretended I didn't hear him
My muse said that's a strength of mine
My muse said that's a strength of mine
