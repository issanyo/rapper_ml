[Intro: milo]
Yeah
Scallops hotel
Scallops Hotel is the building

[Bridge: milo]
Sovereign nose on my arrogant—
('Cause he can see)
('Cause he can see right through you)
Hmm

[Verse: milo]
This lonesome crowd lends well to epistrophe
I don't get drunk off Listerine
Question the method, I tell em, "Accept the mystery"
Sternly, bucking expectations as limiting
I roll the jazz cabbage
While her ass fattens
By the fireside
There's no roundabouts, I play the Yes album for a roundabout
The thousandth time
Friendly reminder: there's ample sky, so I take to it
Mogs cop the break fluid
I put that twenty on five and kept it rolling, my nig'
They so corny and jive ,I kept it rolling, my nig'
It's a lot of dead motherfuckas who was also vigilant
Buzz Killington, wear a beat on a sling like a Remington rifle
MC sought disciples or masters
Really I'm just glad I got the rights to my masters

[Refrain: milo]
And y'all called it "art-rap," shit
And ya'll called it "art—"
And ya'll called it "art-rap"
Dark Twain wrote it falling out the sky on a barf bag
Commit a caper as a eulogy
A hater could be most useful to me
A hater could be most useful to me
A hater could be most useful to me

[Outro: milo]
Scallops Hotel
