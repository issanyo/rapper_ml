On them aves where they might ask you
(They might ask you)
They might ask you, "What you need?"
On them aves where they might ask you

[Verse 1: scallops hotel]
In rich folks' homes, drinks come with coasters
My first rap song was to lament Sammy Sosa
I cast Wingardium Leviosa and peeled past the past in a poot cloud
He's too loud with that humble joint of tree root
In conversations, mumbles to the point he seems rude
Regardless, the point is moot
Listen to Vespertine at noon and again at midnight
Repeat for a fortnight, the dork's right
I prefer the Forsythe to the cold knife
How he teaches henches temperance whilst knee-deep in wenches
We played Ascension, I guess it tempts me
Playing Shin Megami Tensei, tense-eyed
I pivot across, sample the ribbit of frogs to loop before I spit a riveting monologue... or diatribe
Hyper shy, this hooptie can't handle hyperdrive
Gallup polls among groupies show scallops hotel most bourgeois
It's soothing, it's soothing
Trust me, it's soothing

On them aves where they might ask you
(They might ask you)
They might ask you, "What you need?" (Mhm)
On them aves where they might ask you
(They might ask you)
They might ask you, "What you need?"
(Um, um)

I'm okay cause you're okay
Since you're okay, I'm okay
I'm okay cause you're okay
Since you're okay, I'm okay
I'm okay cause you're okay
Since you're okay, I'm okay
