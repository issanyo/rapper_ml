She's like a message in a bottle
She just washed up on shore, wishing somebody came for her
A body of a model
Now I can see she’s been torn before
I see all the stuff you been through
It messed you up
I see your broken lemme fix you up
Oh certainly, let me lift you up
See you hurting baby, hurts me enough
So why would I walk wen u need me the most
I just hold you close to me
When you losing our hope
What you crying for?
She said I felt it all before
Seen it all before
Wen they say they down for you they walk away
Wen I say I'm down for you I mean it babe
You tried to push me away
You was stuck in this place
Ain't giving up I’m trying show you I'm here to stay
Wen they say they down for you they walk away
Wen I say I'm down for you I mean it babe
You tried to push me away
You was stuck in this place
Ain't giving up I'm trying show you I'm here to stay
Yea, she got her head in the clouds
Girl whats on your mind
Will you calm down
Wen she thinking out loud
I wanna know what you thinking about
So wise man once told me
Follow your dreams
So I'm rite here behind you
So where do you lead
Girl whatever it takes for you
To bring me to sea
See you hurting babe
Was enough for me
So why would I walk wen you need me the most
I just hold you close to me
Wen your losing our hope
What you crying for?
She said I felt it all before
Seen it all before
Before
Wen they say they down for you they walk away
Wen I say I'm down for you I mean it babe
You tried to push me away
You was stuck in this place
I’m giving up I’m trying show you I'm here to stay
Wen they say they down for you they walk away
Wen I say I’m down for you I mean it babe
You tried to push me away
You was stuck in this place
Ain't giving up I'm trying show you I'm here to stay
She said I felt it all before
Seen it all before
Like Deja vu (2x)
They always say they love
Then they leave me torn
Like Deja vu
Yea, see there’s so many fish in the sea that might wonder
But who wanna fish that swamp
See I gotta fish wit a broken fin
So she wanna swim on her own again
I could just express my condolences
Would be appropriate over our fairy tale
Little mama got kisses like angel dust
Little shawty is my baby my Ariel
Wen they say they down for you they walk away
Wen I say I'm down for you I mean it babe
You tried to push me away
You was stuck in this place
I'm giving up I'm trying show you I'm here to stay (2x)
She said I felt it all before
Seen it all before
Like deja vu (2x)
They always say the love me then they leave me torn
Like deja vu (2x
