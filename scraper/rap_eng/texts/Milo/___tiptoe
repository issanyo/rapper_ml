[Intro: John Witherspoon]
My hair was afro that close to the mirror
I had to pick my hair like this, yeah
When I ran and the wind would hit it, looked like I had a cape on

[Verse 1: milo]
Juking, Hunter Thompson, histrionics, and music
Until time make you anhedonic
How soil look on the knees of a natural
Why would there be a key to this castle?
Rubbing a bromelin from out the Medina oil display
Ruby Yachty a most loyal brigade
Bait worm, dope all, haters learn through phone calls
Bartleby kneeling, bible leaf eating
Barnabas demo reel, arguing heaven is what you feel
Said he made the vision cloudy
You get payed back for that doubting
It’s in how the limerick gets said
Reciting it off the picture in my head
Blue bugler envelope, I wear the beat like a stethoscope
And play my flugelhorn and learn my flank of attack

[Bridge: milo]
Be the, new negroes, it be them new negroes
It be them new negroes, it be them new negroes
It be them new negroes, it be them new negroes
It be them new negroes

[Chorus: milo]
I’m just floating, gliding, tipping, hoping I ain’t slipping
I’m just floating, gliding, tipping, hoping I ain’t slipping
I’m just floating, gliding, tipping, hoping I ain’t slipping
I’m just floating, yeah

[Verse 2: milo]
When the calendar came unglued, challenger lube
Crude strut tightrope in night court with high hopes
Idealism’s eyesore, three letters on the high score
That’s G-O-D, paid on delivery, made a sinner of me, pricked foot
Gift horse hollow, bush bandit, mush phantom, shush tantrums
From who’s army? All them freedoms seem bewildering
My own thoughts require filtering, and that’s just what it really is
MAWGs will hit you with a penance for what could’ve been
And we drift onward, I compliment her locks’ ombre
All of this with the most high as my only sponsor
There’s a ruby in my forearm, right (right)
There’s a ruby in my forearm, right

[Chorus: milo]
I’m just floating, gliding, tipping, I’m just hoping I ain’t slipping
I’m just floating, gliding, tipping, hoping I ain’t slipping
I’m just floating, gliding, tipping, hoping I ain’t slipping
Floating, just floating
I’m just floating, gliding, tipping, hoping I ain’t slipping
I’m just floating, gliding, tipping, hoping I ain’t slipping
I’m just floating, gliding, tipping, hoping I ain’t slipping
I’m just floating

[Outro: milo]
We gon’ sparkle now
