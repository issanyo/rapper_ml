[Verse 1: milo]
You wind up building chapels, lamenting homies
Bending phonies ‘round labyrinth walls, damn it all to low hell
It’s him who thought “oh well” with regards to life’s entirety
They tried knighting me nightly, calling it therapy
Why do it wear at me? My nig, I used to skip daily
When whim was the only thing worth aiming for
Say no more, Pagliacci, bad photocopy
Once again, from the top now
I hate how rap look from the top down
Coarse seed and bottle on forefinger
Oh, how the remorse lingers
In a past life, I used to hate the bad guy

[Chours: milo]
I realize it was a lack of personal effort
Now I’m weaponized
It was a lack of personal effort
Now I’m weaponized
It was a lack of personal effort

[Verse 2: milo]
Fist full of couscous, breathing like Bruce Bruce
At this point, it’s the hunger steering mostly
Foulmouth flow, time traveling, toasting
A likkle labor and a red penny
Sure it dazzles, but continues to fly over my head
As the violet smiles, violence piles in spreadsheets
It occurred to me I had outgrown doubt
Practicing carpentry like a green almond
Swimming as a giddy dolphin, my little boy giggles often
And that’s my pan to see a pandolce
Now I note how they scare easy
As I snatch square hectares from palms greasy
And that’s my panacea pandolce

[Chours: milo]
I realize it was a lack of personal effort
And now I’m weaponized, now I’m weaponized
It was a lack of personal effort
Now I’m weaponized, now I’m weaponized

[Verse 3: ELUCID]
Doom and glory, and knowing who you are
Did you know that I know who I am?
No, I know, no, no, no, no, I, I know
The law’s an anagram of wealth
My black ark is parked
Where Amy Schumer isn’t targeted marketing
I live inside a computer too
But I wrote this on a backyard hilltop
Thinking about how to get them before they get me
