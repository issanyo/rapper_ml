[Verse]
Scallops Hotel lurk wherever popo don't be
Poetry read direct from the bark of a niopo tree, it's
Only me and mine in a teeny kitchenette at supper time
Measure time as the tire vine swings
This night owl's keen when the king's storyteller can't weave
Through social hegemony
Heard Rory was smokin' dope in the Garden of Gethsemane
How he make a nimbus out that nihilism
Woulda fired on him first but the rods is missin'
This slick curl curtesy murray's pomade
This slick flow curtesy of Dr. Bombay
And tenuring in long hallways
It's all harambee
Off days at this grocery
My mother named me Rory, I'm proficient at this sorcery
Of course its he who clambers back and forth with tape recorders
Idealized truth disorder, It's motherfuck a gatekeeper
The utopian was a late sleeper, an angst weaver
With fidgety digits, with fidgety digits
Scallops Hotel is the building, please don't forget
