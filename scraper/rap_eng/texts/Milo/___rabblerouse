They couldn't predicate upon a precipice
Bet I feel like Perseus but less merciful
I'm thirstiest
Most of all impervious
The wordsmith gets knee deeper
Beleaguered, his burdens at will summon purpose
I'm weaker when the light is on
Portion of the pie chart I share with tweakers wearing nylon
I might build you a worthwhile fortress
With borrowed resources
On the front door we painted a mural of the meek tortoise
World picturing, place-making, gate keeping
Do my best scheming in the late evening
I write poems and build suits of armor for suicide note authors
The Melungeon porch monkey accompaniment
Got caught wondering out loud again
You scrawled the word "discursive" in cursive
And called yourself subversive
We all belly laugh
I wrote this rap from Mike Eagle's helipad
Now watch me dance, now watch me dance

(Overconfidence is the greatest enemy! SEEYEAAH!)
