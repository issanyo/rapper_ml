Dedi- dedi-
How I- umm
Spit this rhyme in traffic, yo
Dedicate this- yo yo
Dedicate this flow- shit yo yo
Dedicate this flow to my- uh oh yea yea

Dedicate this flow to my family
Al came through and scooped me in the Camry
For my worthwhile fortress
My sun is shining, my God, today is gorgeous
I don't feel like pouting on no beat, dog
I don't feel like pouting on no beat, dog
The way these wack motherfucks get on is baffling
Point that fuckin' trumpet at St Anthony, it's agony
We need to open the gate up
Al played me the beat, feel like a layup
Feel like seeing my pops in a year
His lineup still so sharp, it could slice lettuce
And let us pray for each hater individually
I dedicate this flow to my family
And let us pray for each hater individually
You'd rhyme better if you accepted the hard work is done spiritually
It astounds me, how I always bring the flatulence
Like I'm rhyming for the souls of mischievous bodies past tense
I can choose to break this jar and huff the last gas
I drew it like escotarse
How y'all rhyme remind me of a fake-ass Atari
Stuck on load screen
It astounds me how I always bring my audience
Like I'm rhyming for spirits and ghosts
Randall bezzling ?? spirits I boast
This Ruby Yacht flow
Cause we all paid our blood ties
This Ruby Yacht flow
Cause we all paid our blood ties
So you understand it's blood ties when I say these my brothers
Born asunder
Lord of thunder, master Raiden
In a pointy hat
Anoint me, black, obsidian cube
The Prime Meridian druid
Sippin' elixir conductor of rhythms so fluid
Could reveal hideous truths
There was a specific beauty to it
How he yanked the weighted curtain
There was beauty to it
How he yanked the weighted curtain
There was beauty to it

[safari al]
Beauty to it
I feel like pouting on no beat, dog
Al pick up the verse like it was leapfrog
I didn't have to sign a non-compete clause
Cause I'm not outside the company or faculty
But from the depth, familiars approach with captive
Incitement, it'll go
Under descended Jet Li extending teleprompter
Formations repeated, this succession of fadings
Under descended Jet Li extending teleprompter
A succession of fade-ins and fade-outs
Speaking all together, a thousand trees
Moving through a tremulous, forgotten speech
Speaking a t- moving through a- forgotten- it's such
Such a trouble to find a good orchestra
?? hibernating or hiding of what
Such a trouble to find a good orchestra, now
?? hibernating or-
The faces seeded people shed through a faint tear
They moving fabulous exaggerated omission
Speaking all together, a thousand trees
Moving through a tremulous, forgotten speech
