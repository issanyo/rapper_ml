[Verse 1]
In Decatur eating waffle house for meals that aren't breakfast
Remember how it felt when the grand verbalizer left us
I don't give a fuck about nary one of y'all, said
Rory's rather scary in them Ruby Yacht coveralls
How he clutch the mic like the heaviest hammer
Debby downer with the steady grammar, fluid with mystique
Druid chic, asking questions they don't want the answers
Pastoral landscaper who wrote out every curseword on fine sandpaper
The mild man's labor is converted into coin, it's a favor to exploit your co-on
Talkin' to Scallops Hotel, he go, on and on, and on and on
He go, on and on and on and on
He go, on and on
He go, on and on
Daddy bug gettin' open again
Daddy bug gettin' open again

[Verse 2]
I'll do better
I'll do better and reject hollow compliments
It's just me and my standards on a big flan continent
How he tap into the whole source code
From lug nut to lignum
A dutch, a bag of ism and a lovely sense of rhythm, a gully cynicism
How he do that, how he do that

How he tap into the whole source code
From lug nut to lignum
A dutch, a bag of ism and a lovely sense of rhythm, a gully cynicism
How he do that, how he do that

From lug nut to lignum
A dutch, a bag of ism and a lovely sense of rhythm, a gully cynicism
How he do that, how he do that
How he do that, how he do that
How he do that, how he do that
How he do that, how he do that

Scallops Hotel is the building
