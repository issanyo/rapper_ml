[Verse: milo]
Tracing it backward, the path will seem infinite
I've been rapping back since cats was proud to be innocent
Now everybody fronting, suppose fronting due diligence
While they chew through well-done mutton ligament
Swished and swallow, a sparrow in the large bottle
Singing throatily; download time pings appropriately
And new packets are processed as knowledge
I hate how people speak on the Internet
The overwhelming decorum of an invisible place ain't for me
I poke at the glass angrily, like—

[Refrain: milo]
Where are you?
Stare in the mirror, like, "Where are you?"
Where are you?
Where are you?
Stare in the mirror, like, stare in the mirror, like
"Where are you?"
Where are you?
(I keep it real, yeah)

[Verse 2: milo]
The circle shrank
MAWGs at karate when they never passed the purple rank
Tank take dozer, I outrank a poser
With a T1, nostrum grocers on the machine gun
I make that canary sing
Cloying with they beady eyes
Spit it like a Pottsylvanian spy, off the goof gas
I was under a not-so-ancient sky in a do-rag
Captain Caveman pull up with Dee Dee Skyes
And I needed that
And I, and I needed that

[Refrain: milo]
Catch myself in that mirror and I just be looking, like, shit
"Where are you?"
Where are you?
Catch myself in that mirror and I'm just, like
"Where are you?"
Where are you?
Where are you?

[Outro: milo & (other)]
(What's Dee Dee Skyes?)
Hm?
(What's Dee Dee Skyes?)
Dee Dee Skyes—did you ever watch the cartoon Captain Caveman? He was this ugly, hairy caveman who had like five biddies, and Dee Dee Skyes was like the super fine one—that I thought was super fine as a kid
(Wait, how old are you? Twenty–?)
–Five
(I'm thirty-four)
But that show was even before my time, because I was just like—
(Really? Because yeah, I've heard of it—crudely drawn)
Yeah, well it's just like of the time, so everything to us looks crudely drawn, but, yeah, just, I don't know
