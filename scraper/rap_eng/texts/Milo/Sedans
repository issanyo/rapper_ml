[Intro: milo]
I'm here as a representative of the Tanaka clan
Oh I gottaâ€”? Okay
Well, I guess I'll demonstrate this move
The dim mak
Okay

[Verse: milo]
Cut off my antenna and wonder why the messages stopped
In human times they kill the messenger and harvest the neighbors' crops
On the boundary of the absurd where labor drops
Eating a bowl of rice and beans I suppose they say lots of things
Tuck what's God's honest behind what seems obscene
Most of it's gesturing, rock a gerund like an overcoat
Ruby Yacht, motorboat, Horus with the morbid overtones
Fortune cookie lucky numbers for a horoscope
I'm with Shea-man in Ray-Bans, niggas can't touch us
In sedans in Sudan, nigga's not bluffin' with that long stick
I'm in that RBYT clique
We on that very indie shit and we don't need to fuck with you
And you don't want to fuck with this
Ro-Man scaled a mountain etch it on the edifice
Step to a rapper like you not a worthy nemesis
On the side of the road tellin' a PO I peddle medicines
Been on a higher level since you was eating gummy vitamins
Myka 9 called my shit high art and on the pie chart
My part look like quiet Pac Man
I'm on my riotous self righteous, pulled many all-nighters
My last apprentice died, shit
But y'all just want them tired quips about stubbed toes
Six years in the wild turn a person cutthroat
I wish I could give a fuck about a brushstroke
Hit it with the gusto, bam!
I'm Emeril Legasse with that ol' frying pan
Emeralds adorn my body on the bough of a Ruby Yacht
And know it's no remorse 'cause rapping is a blood sport
And know it's no remorse 'cause rapping is a blood sport
It's called the dim mak
Crossing the Ruby Yacht would be a dim thought, huh
That'd be a dim thought
