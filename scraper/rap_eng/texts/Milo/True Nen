[Intro] (x2)
There is a me there is a you, and absolutely nothing else
Your favorite rapper talks too much about his fucking self

[Verse 1]
I use my mind like a dull pencil
Rap reminds me of the Water Temple
What's the missing Link?
Or Missingno?
Fuck a cold shoulder
I'm from Chicago where it's frigid though
It's the paily pale paladin who
Only writes down the really real happenings to
Tamper the sound of my soul's own rattling
Wrote raps that read like Russian spy plans
Claustrophobic like fat people in MRI scans
No disrespect
Keep any heat by the fine China dinner set
Your man's caught the chill and it ain't even winter yet
Daaaaaaaaaannng

[Verse 2]
Now we in Boyle Heights wearing goose down coats
Learned a few lessons to not talk loose 'round folks or
Deploy metaphors comparing years to tires spokes
That's trite
You're eating tripe and bragging I
Take a bite of pita
My pants are sagging
I don't want to discuss the Feynman Lectures
I don't give a shit about the glow zone
Wrote my illest rhymes on a GoPhone
To this day I'm playing Snake to jog my memory
Incredibly pompous my origins are top shelf
Spent experience points on stealth, cunning
Silence and exile to your left is a big pile
Of dead rappers and coded slappers in my genome

[Outro]
See that's like a punctuation mark, ya feel me?
