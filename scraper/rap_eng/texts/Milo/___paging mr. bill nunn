[Verse 1]
In the belly of a whale, diorama like Jan Rodricks
A single day with a hundred pockets
Most understated mage
Flow monotone, how you sublimate the rage
I be to rap what Keynes be to Locke
What scenes be to plot
Or a cop tapping on the glass
Like "what seems to be the problem?"

[Verse 2]
They were convinced Sufism was expressed by hat choice
Auto-dictate my didact and map it to black noise
Said the target audience was mothers of blonde-headed black boys
We shouldn't be complimenting fence-building nihilists
Frankly, the frankincense isn't working
All I'm doing is working, understand life is a chore list
What a blessing this boredom is

[Chorus]
He don't know me very well, do he?
Report the bridge for blowup
He don't know me very well, do he?
Report the bridge for blowup
Had to switch styles up and tell em'
"Hol', hol', hol' up"
"Hol', hol', hol' up"
Yeah, he don't know me very well, do he?
He don't know me very well, do he?

[Bridge]
Who taught me of my enemies?
Who's constantly debriefing me?
Who taught me of my enemies?

[Refrain]
(They couldn't possibly become anything other than
What had been demonstrated in front of them)

[Outro]
What's understood ain't got to be said
My soul is flushing in a public park toilet in '69
Debate is catechism
Preference to read the Braille
At the barrier, the patriarch paused
The giver should be thankful
As the magician becomes a sorcerer
Refusing to be smothered under the allostatic load
Refusing to be smothered under the allostatic load
Refusing to be smothered
