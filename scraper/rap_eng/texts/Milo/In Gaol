[Verse 1: Milo]
We took turns eating cake that looked like a flag
And watched the fireworks and I swear I smelled the liars burn
Troubled aquarian doing equestrian things
And a hairy centaur involved in too many Ponzi schemes
Lay on the bathroom tile and think of Billy Mays
And how to make a girl smile in a myriad of silly ways
Listen to the Shins and learn how to sing the right notes
Dream of dorsal fins when manning all the lifeboats
Abandoned baggage in the carousel
I hear Paris is swell this time of year
I guess I'm kind of weird
Daydreaming of Logan's Run then recline a gear
I'm fine here (I'm fine here)
I have very soft skin and write young adult fiction like Gary Paulsen
I'm Frida Kahlo
Your Instagram is pics of pita chips and deer tallow
Condense a rap song into a question, then mutter it

(I wrote this song in green pen)

[Hook: Milo]
Eating brownies, I don't know why I'm frowning
It all happened before I could remember
(Pass the milk, pass the milk)

[Verse 2: Milo]
Run a BBW tumblr blog and forget the password
I may be speaking too soon but this is a disaster
Like old people in modern sneakers
I saw a Book of Mormon with a congregation of true believers
I'm humbled eating lemon bars
I would never waste a daydream on seven cars
I have hella smarts and nudie parts that I never show
I think I'm a noticeably negro Euthyphro

[Hook: Milo]
Eating brownies, I don't know why I'm frowning
It all happened before I could remember
(Pass the milk, pass the milk)
(Alright, boy. There you go)

[Verse 3: KOOL A.D.]
Hey, dude
You like this weird rap song?
It's me, KOOL A.D
The other fool on the weird rap song
A mellow number, 3 minutes, it doesn't last long
Some fools might tell you it's whack, but I think that that's wrong
Really, in fact, I think it's tight
That's right
Wrote this on a carcass of a lion by lamp light
That was a reference to another KOOL A.D. rap line
The last time I said "candle light" instead of "lamp light"
Get it?
So that's like about progress
I'm Michael Ondaatje kissing on your mom in a prom dress
Meaning like she's in a prom dress, not me
I guess, um, that was obvious probably
But shit, you never know
Fools cry over spilled milk and argue over whether a leather kilt is hetero
In my humble, I gotta say is probably just, um, better to let it go
I feel like Leonard Cohen
And I don't even know if I can name a Leonard Cohen track
Is Leonard Cohen wack?
That's rhetorical, you don't need to answer that
I'm Dave Bowie, I mutter question raps for the answer, man
Like mice, I might turn butter to milk like "catch me if you can"
Chris Walken how I'm talking, kriss-krossing on your walkman
She sucking on a dick like it's a tall can
Pass the Four Loko
I'm a leader at last to my local folks, but still broke though
Fuck the Beatles, go Yoko
You know, bro?
