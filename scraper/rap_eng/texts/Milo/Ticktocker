Breathe
It is time to make the time
It is my father singing
It is my mother at the river
It is the spear and the chain
It is your time to swallow the hill
Breathe
Emoyeni passing, passing behind the dust
Emoyeni passing, passing behind the fear
Breath
Emoyeni going, going
I see the coming of the long green rain, breathe
