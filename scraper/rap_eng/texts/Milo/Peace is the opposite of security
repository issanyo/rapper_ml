[Verse 1: Elucid]
Need you, dream you, find you, taste you
Use you, scar you, fuck you, break you
Need you, dream you, find you, taste you
Use you, scar you, fuck you, break you
Spare change for drug store sushi
Juggle monkey hustle great for hand-rolled loosie
Kept his kick laced loosely never plan on runnin'
Lucky loop George Duke stand to watch how it's comin'
Cloud cover acid rain blasted crashin' burnin' the shade brushin' ashes
Broke a sleep, calmly reach for his blade, Bulls on Parade
Universal laws remain, head in the game, caught in the tech fresh out, tryna maintain
Wax and wane, chapped and ashen, hacked human, half-witch, what y'all laughin?
Reality's not all that's displayed, graphiced hard plastic
Automated action, agitated how we behave
Wide net cast over jagged chasm compassion, we're a fuckin' plague
Anxiously waiting for the world to collapse, then nothin' happened
Out here tryin to get a fax cos that goddamn Gmail's backwards
Rose with the sun, the sky looks soft behind these window bars
Wrought iron, my city defies silence, tiny riots, islands to ourselves
Speeding down the belt, transatlantic air traffic overhead
Honkin' secrets in public, bustin lies when in private
Befuddled in lesbian covens, beggin miss for a slice, bless you
Son of Eshu, boondocks, three red room we bled through
Made a mess, birth cycle successful
Might have done with less but we never went without
Might have done with less but we never went without

[Verse 2: Milo]
Yellow back radio broke down, nomos negates agape, nostrum grocers cosplay
To reiterate there's no off-days so if i'm repeatedly pretending
I'm replete to keep the ending, pipsqueaks keep cementing me to yesterday's projections
A stunning introspective of the very old young person
Why's my thumb hurtin? I be posting signs and bills and symbols across the labor temple
Teeny funks like minefields to a mostly fragile mental state
Tabula rasa require impeccable credit statement
But to whom did niggas accredit the statement?
