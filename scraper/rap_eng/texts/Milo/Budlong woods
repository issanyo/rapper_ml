[Intro]
Hey, what's goin' on?
Hey, what's goin' on?
Hey, what's goin' on?

[Verse 1]
I fiddled with my feelings 'til I swear I saw the ceiling crack
Heard the words leave my mouth before I knew I was feeling that
Caterpillars scurried down my capillary veins
And I blinked a couple times because I’m nervous
Finding purpose laying on the kitchen floor again
Daydreams of Deloreans, but a Kanye West context
Kept me reading Complex, that was waste of all my dollar signs
Be compassionate with smaller minds
Hide behind the shower liner, you are not a coward minor

[Verse 2]
Fingers too big for origami folds
I dozed off during your Anunnaki flow
Find me celebrating my irrelevancy
Merely tolerating your hesitancy
Do you think you could make a .gif of this?
Have you read the Myth of Sisyphus?
Do you know the symptoms of syphilis?
The fried rice Nietzsche
And Price Right having a seizure
I'm late to the luncheon after
We should consult a Dungeon Master
This is a Münchausen disaster that echoes back to old times
You should've heard his first mixtape
That's when he had his dopest rhymes

I thought, "Oh, Well", with regards to my entire life

[Verse 3]
In the City you miss the seasons change
Memorize the pseudonym for the hedonists
Who wanna learn your name, never felt a tinge of guilt
Skipping class to play Borderlands
Notice the cracks on this hoarder's hands
Earl Sweatshirt voice-over of his most morbid demands
