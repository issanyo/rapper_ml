[Intro: Jay-Z]
The vocabulary, y'mean the vocabulary is so vast, so big
I couldâ€”I could make you a whole album full of stories, y'know what I'm saying?
The challenge for me is to make it, um, y'know, close to what I've seen, or my experiences, and still rhyme

[Verse 1: milo]
What's a selfie? That's not me, that's my chullachaqui
The path is littered with many a useless tchotchke
I'm Muriel crying, "Eustace!" in that building lobby
Oh, and my Courage is such a cowardly dog
Glasses look like jam jars, rap like if Doctor Parnassus
Was an ansar, ancestor with a capital A
You would sign a contract to earn a capital wage
While we tenured in this deplorable reality
It's a black V5 that earns my salary, impeccable memory
I'm Salazar Slytherin by the salad bar, giggling
Cause I seen that, cause I (seen)
Cause I seen that, cause I (seen)
Microphone on my shoulder like a bazooka that shoots a tooth
My nigga I'm falling apart it's not so much the screws is loose
It don't feel therapeutic just blabbering about neutered truths
Now I got this Big Gulp full of words I gotta eat
It's a burden to have to speak but I would never let them tell it
Bet my barbaric yawp'll echo through the ages
You remind me of how a parrot talk in stages
Like the words don't belong to you
Just mimicking sounds, sounds, sounds

[Chorus: milo]
Y'all was imitating God trying to mimic our sounds
That was imitating God trying to mimic our sounds
And y'all was imitating God trying to mimic our sound

[Verse 2: E L U C I D]
I love wild things wildly, I love quiet things quietly
I wasn't raised this way, my mom, she keep on reminding me
I talk like a man, but that means nothing at all
I'm more than my dick and my wallet but that means nothin at all
Say she fell in love with my hands, I love to play in her hair
She only listen when I'm inside her, I'll stay right here
Agency agents see I'm running, they wait for me
This rooster's in East New York
I'm up early enough to last to feel the rope
Who needs work without the payoff? I voted for a human wage
When living is a protest, I can't get free without you
I can't get free without you, I can't get free without you

[Chorus: milo]
(One more time with feeling in it, hear ghost frequencies)
Y'all was, y'all was, y'all was...
Y'all was imitating God trying to mimic our sound
Y'all was imitating God trying to mimic our sound
Y'all was imitating God trying to mimic our sound
Y'all was imitating God trying to mimic our sound
