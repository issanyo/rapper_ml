[Intro - Milo]
This one, this one, this one

[Verse 1: Elucid]
This one, this a thousand dollar tape ‘cause I say so
Fuck up your safe, though
Scram, this is one for the faithful
A rose that grows from treads where the tank roll
Serpents and rainbows
No, we don’t explain flows
Shouldn’t take a genius to [?] my lingo
Rasca, gringo, who that peekin’ my window?
Splayed out of Kimbo’s, skin glow honey
Harmonize to a crescendo
Post-coital slipback in a sinkhole, swing low
Sing songs, neutralize the syndrome
Then bone and [?] and depend on
Livin’ wrong, don’t come for me, I ain’t sent for
Limit your form once again, y’all
The value determinant, game gushing out the tourniquet
Were to this the [?] third or lessoning in permanence
Burn it all away, learning and discerning
Probably running late, but I’m on my way (on my way)
Thousand dollar tape ‘cause I say so
The best fertilizer is the plantation owner’s foot
Bishop took rook, all my job off-the-books
Can’t stay where I’m put, keep inside if you’re shook
There’s a [?] to respect, there’s a wrong to correct
There’s a debt to resolve, if I hear another motherfucker say this ain’t my job
This ain’t my job

[Verse 2: Milo]
Well, it is my job
Footprint on raincloud courtesy this jealous God
So mind is infinite acres, my madness is sacred
Put it like this:
This a thousand-dollar tape ‘cause I say so
Wipe my ass with yo gatefold
Best fertilizer’s plantation owner foot
Nostrum grocer’s two butchers who will cut it off-the-books
They only covet what is took
Repeat it as cleansing, the beat is splendid
Industry angry they couldn’t lease these independents
Black American Gun Club
And in the back is a pool
Your baby’s too young
Get them babies swimming
There’s a black American gun club
And in the back is a pool
If you baby’s too young you can
Free swimming lessons in the back
Don’t give me no money
It’d be a black American gun club, there’d be a pool in the back if your kid’s too—
[unintelligible]
(Free swim lessons) Get them babies swimming
A black American gun club
