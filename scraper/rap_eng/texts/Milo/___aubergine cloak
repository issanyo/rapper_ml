[Intro: ?]
Art speaks to people, that's why they use it against you
When you hear, hundreds of times a day; stuff that's anti your development. Make you sing songs that tell you you don't have no sense, you're crazy, you don't have no future and you think you're just singing a song. You're actually teaching yourself the propaganda of the opposed. The problem is that they're able to bribe and entice our people, oppressed people, to take part in art forms that actually attack them. Our people will, a lot of times they're not conscious enough to avoid helping their enemies because they can finally say they're getting paid, and that's their excuse

[Verse 1: milo]
Tin can polemic, low tone like Olmec said it
Old school separatist, upper hand on any nepotist
You trying to join the party, I'm like hold up, let's see your weapons list
You're not made integral simply, pledging allegiances
A curious case of waking up, a spurious chase is taking up
Most of my free time, a ghost in the bee hive
A boast is a type of prayer, a shield is a kind of rug
In appeal to the mind above, blithe spirit dancing coon
When lunacy won't fit in Haiku
Predecessor predator, radon sensor, screaming shrill
Needing the feeling, feeling, made a meal to kill the evening
Made a meal to kill the evening
Fitted like a white supremacist, grand daddy hunted
Slave man boots in the land of dandy lovers, candy crushers
Make a gutter snipe mutter twice
Got a scimitar that'll turn your chopper butter knife
Oh, what a life, oh, oh what a life
Oh, what a life, oh, what a life
Oh, what a life, oh, what a life

[Chorus: milo]
Belly out like I'm Pierrot le Fou
How dare you defy physics like I'm Pierrot le Fou
How dare you, I ain’t scared of you motherfuckers (I ain't scared)
I ain't scared (I ain't scared)
Belly out like I'm Pierrot le Fou
How dare you defy physics like I'm Pierrot le Fou
How dare you, I ain’t scared (I ain't scared)

[Verse 2: milo]
Aubergine cloak
They heard "Ruby Yacht" and was looking for the actual boat
Like poet's first spell ain't metaphor, nevermore
Ashy ancient speak nascent at the cellar's peak
Islands of future tense, wield sword like an ethical data
Ethnic native, hopscotching epic myth
Bottle rocket exorcist, Allen and Heath alchemist
Doubting Maoist, champagne flutes over the bow
Into the mist (into the mist), over the bow into the mist (into the mist)

[Chorus: milo]
Belly out like I'm Pierrot le Fou
How dare you defy physics like I'm Pierrot le Fou
How dare you, I ain’t scared of you motherfucker (I ain't scared)
I ain't scared (I ain't scared)
