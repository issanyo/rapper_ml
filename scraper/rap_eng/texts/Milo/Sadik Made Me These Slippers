[Intro]
Yeah buddy
Out by the alfalfa sprouts
Check, yeah
I fucked it up
I fucked it up
Let me do it again

[Verse 1]
Out by the alfalfa sprouts
Overextended, casting wild doubts
And it's, hard to pretend when
It's time to sow and yield a nagging tick
Like how not doing chores feels
Like speaking in quips from only Seinfeld
Thinking you had ginned up a genuine mind-meld
Truth is you just consume in similar ways
Shedding all types of names from my earlier days
Activate shields to ward off covetous looks
My mother Facebook posts pictures of her coloring books
Making me Black Harold with crayon purple
You should pray I don't hurt you
You should pray I don't hurt you
Off the specter on the spectrum
Sectumsempra at the lectern
I don't need the whole spectrum
To paint another universe
The hand of the maker is visible at all times

[Verse 2]
Never in my life have I listened to Magna Carta
I watch films by Agnes Varda with my wife on weekdays
Recalcitrant, Sebaceous Griffin with the malcontent
I heard that rapper you love is a facile manipulator
Copping hand motions from Art Basel gesticulators
You don't want to look up to nobody like that
You don't want to look up to nobody like that, dawg
Nah, nah
