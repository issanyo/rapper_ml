[Intro]
It’s almost there, it’s almost there
It’s like, check one, two, two, one, two, two
Can we get another one going?
I’ll put some money on it, you buying a bag?
He lying, check one, two, yeah
He ain’t got no money, I’ll put some money on it
Yeah, what up, uh huh, uh huh
Uh huh, uh huh, compliments the company, of course
Courtesy your friends at the Scallops Hotel
Bombay marks the, I, love with the

[Verse]
Butterscotch butter crinkle, my muse is bilingual
Her gaze piercing, baby momma instinct
Faking normalcy, hormones extorting me
The horror of gorgeousness, Black Orpheus
Smash, loot, determined for haze, grassroots
The last game of spades, in cahoots with an irascible nave
Who points at his own pot belly
Slave man boot, don’t fail me, slave man boot, don’t fail me
Clouded lemon tree, Solomon grew accustomed to the bowing and bended knees
The scent was heavenly
Wisdoms tarnished to the same color as piss pot
Related by deviance, certain queries repeated
The berries were sweetened, lingon, languish
Who grip be by the pinger, power you
Britta water filtered juice with freshened caboose, kaboom
And a handful of mixed nuts
Leave the show like “milo spoke so well”
Threaten to poke a hole through my fontanel
Idle and bewildered, burnt, booty like bald crudely recalls
Another bygone anthem, psychic tantrum
That machine left my memory rotoscoped
Ro got ambition in bushels, bundles, barrels
Hunting the herald, rest in peace Harold Hunter
Blunted SOS, grunting “Yes, yes”
A disservice when art nuevo act rich, my bong water brackish
We was jigging to Tony Braxton, me and my big love like Bill Paxton
Bro got old and rich off niggas like Phil Jackson
Pass on the ostentatious displays of wealth
Ran her palms along the green felt
Y’all was using binoculars wearing LL Bean belts
My money circle through black economies
From your perspective, Ro was naval-gazing spook astrology
Goose anatomy reduced to flattery, it ain’t no batteries
Self-sufficient male directly to the kitchen where I like to help the help with dishes

[Outro]
That’s Ruby Yacht on all days
And that’s Ruby Yacht, no off days
That’s Ruby Yacht on all days
And that’s Ruby Yacht, no off days
That’s Ruby Yacht on all days
And that’s Ruby Yacht, no off days
That’s Ruby Yacht on all days
And that’s Ruby Yacht, no off days
