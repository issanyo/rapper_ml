[Intro: scallops hotel]
I feel (yeah, yeah, yeah)
I feel fuckin' invulnerable
I feel fuckin' invulnerable
I feel fuckin' invulnerable
…

[Verse 1: Safari Al]
No need to mention the stress in cargo
So there is a need to mention the blessed parcel
In the belly that is French smith kissed
Black coal core strength in the fury in the tank
Miserably curious with the gut to think
Crush it down to resin, smudge the lesson
Brushed the feathered edges, contours if kept in
Smudge the lesson and frustrate pledges to
Protect boundary by eliminating boundary
By eliminating hiding, by
Providing the entrances' entrenchment
In the quest to find the key

[Bridge: Safari Al]
Crust tight, boss fight, searchlight, and personal space
Ox tide, war pike, birthright, improbable haste

[Verse 2: scallops hotel]
There aren't enough letters to rearrange
To describe the depth of my rage—
I was born this way
Another song stuffed in my mouth hole
When depression is no longer fashionable
When the potential begins sapping the actual
And there you are overwhelmed, splintering into fractals
I've been there Sis, I've been there
Oh hell, another morning in the stomach of a blue whale
You're wondering why you're breathing, and I have as well
I've been there Sis, I've been there
(I feel fuckin' invulnerable)
