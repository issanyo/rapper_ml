[Sample: Reggie Baylor]
The moment you receive funding for art, you've sold out
The moment you're paid to associate yourself to art, you're sold out
The moment you sell one painting, you sell out
So why not just multiply that as many times as you possibly can
And then be able to continue to do the thing that you're so passionate about your entire life, continuously and consistently
This is how it really, really started
The professor in the philosophy class put this line on the chalkboard
And then began to explain that the line is what we use to create everything
Mankind uses this for science, mankind uses this for chemistry
We use this for architectural purposes, we use it for engineering
We use it for computers, we use it for storytelling, filmmaking
It is what man uses to make any object
Well then I start thinking, well, if that's the case, then in a line there are points from one line to the next
How do you get from one point to the next
Linear thinking
And if I want to be an artist, what do I need to do to go from one point to the next
Now if I have- how many options do I have when I'm going to point AB
Just so you know imma interrupt you
This is all up here, it's not gonna sound- it's not gonna make any sense to you at all
None at all
Remember I'm an artist, but I'm talking about logic
From point A to point B the professor clearly stated that there are an infinite amount of points between two points
An infinite
And I started to say to myself well if there's an infinite amount of points, what if I just found one for myself
So if the possibilities are infinite, there's no big issue here, it's not that difficult
You just have to find one in infinity
Second question, my senior year in, um, sculpture class something similar to this
I was given twenty minutes- every student was given twenty minutes to give an oral presentation from this question
What is good art
Well, you know, I'm a senior and I'm thinking to myself well, uh, you know, I've spent four years
I get a lot of- I got a lot of As, I was very studious
I was doing good artwork
This is an easy question
Well what happened was all the presentations prior to mine I then started to argue
It was a constant argument
The person would say this- case in point, um, which was my favorite, good art means it is consistently aesthetically relevant
And that one really got me, so you know what I think that's what good art really could be
But then I started to say, well what if it was consistently inconsistently aesthetically relevant
So that an artist then would do a hundred paintings and none of them looked alike, wouldn't that inconsistency necessarily mean that is now good
So consistent or inconsistent good art could exist
