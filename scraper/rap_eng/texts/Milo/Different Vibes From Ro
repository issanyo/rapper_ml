[Verse ]
Say it like this
My very being here is an act of rebellion
Scallops Hotel is the building, house of felons
Shaded spot where the elotes man sells melons
Put it like this
Yo, the kid is bonafide
Ralph Ellison's Rinehart personified
Too ill with the quill and the sheath
Bug out in the pub where the dullards swill grease
A real nuisance with the nuance
Like you really thought that we martyred you
But that was just the Kobayashi Maru
I'm reading Andre Malraux in these days of wrath
Or was it days of yore
Stalin's Granddaughter cosplaying as Tank Girl
You couldn't cop enough sweatshirts to thank Earl
Meanwhile, comparing schematics of rocking chairs
Seen a Ruby Yacht and said, "You could fit a flock in here"
[?]
Time is a flat circle; I toss it how I want to, bruh
The Thief of Nakatomi Plaza ain't supposed to die no natural death
The Thief of Always ain't supposed to die no natural death
Leos Carax how I manipulate my flickering light
Tall boy descending the pygmy
Counting dead fruits in the crotch of a fig tree
They arm an Asantu[?] with that slanderous mambo
However, I'm gnawing towards the center having trouble defining centripetal
Home studio is altered, pen a rap like it's a ancient ritual
And It's all incandescence
The Corduroy Coon Prince ain't supposed to die no natural death
Black Orpheus ain't supposed to die no natural death
