[Verse 1]
Like points on a skill tree
I plant my will as a real tree
Several times over
Bishop Berkeley at the long October tavern boat
And ashy ankle patron saint utopians in the house the third piggy built
Me and the grizzly guilt for making it out alive
Of raking in felt commercializing the battle cry
As the days prattle by
Truth is, government is hallucination in the mind of the governor
What's the oven mitt for
Inadequacy at spacial metaphor to discuss politics
It's not a policy statement abominably based in the sub space
Every day I watch my neighbor build a gallows
Any critique I had seemed shallow, so I wrote this rap song
Spit it casual-like or spit it like Casual

[Chorus]
You're wack and it's all your fault (Your fault)
You're wack and it's all your fault (Your fault)
You're wack and it's all your fault (It's all your fault)
You're wack and it's all your fault (You're wack)
You're wack and it's all your fault (You're wack)
You're wack and it's all your fault (You're wack)
You're wack and it's all your fault (You're wack)

[Verse 2]
Wood sword Yojimbo
Takes heel turn, does heel toe
Dipping back and forth with racket like McEnroe
Clumsy with ratchets like Macklemore
Used to be straight edge and they don't even ask no more
Self-medicated somnambulist ice skating on the stage again
Double axle swirl rainbow jimmies
It's the stained soul in me
Praying for a cleansing wane

[Interlude: Sample]
Are you familiar with subject matter of this proceeding?
Yes sir
Do you have anything to add to this?

[Verse 3]
Tempting pains, bargain hunter hungers
Ardent other brother, I'm the ardent other brother fond of sea clay
Itching my chin like I'm Wee-Bey in Soulfolks
Hit them with the slow flow, Ro with the choke holds
Ro with the sweepstakes, Ken with the beat breaks
Ro with the welder's torch, Ro with the smorgasbord
Ro with the forceful retort, the green horse for-
The green horse for rap

[Outro]
Never put me in your box if your shit eats tapes
Don't ever put me in your box if your shit eats tapes
Don't ever put me in your box if your shit eats tapes
Don't ever put me in your box if your shit eats tapes
Never put me in your box if your shit eats tapes
Don't ever put me in your box if your shit eats tapes
Don't ever put me in your box if your shit eats tapes
