[Verse 1]
We played hopscotch on the riverbed
Long pulls of liquor till your liver's dead
It's been too long since I used my falsetto
If my mind was a neighborhood it would be the ghetto
Into the Wild for the thousandth time
And I am celebrating life with a child's mind
My sweater got snagged on the witch-hazel
Wonder if my heart's the same shape as this red bud
Body full of tingles like I slept with some bed bugs

Galaxies for eyes makes me feel infinitesimal
My own system of numbers are regular sexagesimal
You can't crunch those digits on a binary abacus
Struggling to mutter three words
I'm very bad at this
There's too much dirt under my finger nails
You don't know how liberating it feels to fail
To know these old bones are brittle and frail
I've been in the woods and seen the sterility of a blank night
And felt it cold cruelty cut deep like a shank knife
When these ugly ghosts take a seat at breakfast
I make it a point to use my napkin and not act reckless
My long legs feel just like trombones
Why are all my memories archived in sepia tones

[Refrain]
Which of these trees is a tamarack?
How deep will its roots grow?
When its leaves fall, I hope they fall slow
And when it's dark, I will strip its bark down
I may not be a whole thing but I'm a part now [x4]
