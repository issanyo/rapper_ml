[Verse One: Milo]
We were drinking coffee out of Mason jars
And replacing stars with cheap taboos
The track marks on your face are dried Elmer’s glue
I feel aloof enough to introspect
Read and reread womanist texts
There’s a hierarchy of needs
My kill count includes way too many centipedes
Tell myself I’m not a jerk
Tell your mom I’m not a jerk
Shy away from jobs, borrow money, anything that works
That isn’t work
You read Catch-22 on the Kindle
I used to play "Turkey in the Straw” on the fiddle
Weave a tapestry, my mouth is like a spindle
Modern sitcom titled, “Malcolm X in the Middle”
Which is the bad pill: red, blue or Advil?
Used to write poems and tell myself I had mad skills
My pops would sing in the shower; what a neat vibrato
Hold the violin bow proper when plucking pizzicato
I want to be a bird that wrote in a letter to Nelly Furtado
I’m mostly lonely until I figure out the angles
She laughs when I call her my spottieottiedopaliscious angel
I could make you a delicious peach crumble
You don’t want to send and receive all these messages I bungled
We could go on a swell date to the arcade
Watch your eyes glaze when I give you the star map that I made

[Verse Two: Milo]
One time a bird shit on me while I was waiting for the L train
Dragon Ball Z wasn’t worth watching until Cell came
That’s rather macabre, I hate ask, but what about Bob?
I’ve been wearing flannel pajama bottoms for too long
Only muster the courage to leave the house when the oolong is gone
I don’t like my lentils hard
You snatched me up like one of Olmec’s temple guards
I splurged and bought a case of Bubba Cola
For Pete’s sake, we had plans to buy a bloody Corolla
The domesticated life has been filed away in a beige folder
A well-spoken black man, let me be your Eric Holder
Or more aptly, Erik Estrada
You made delicious cookies with chocolate chips
I want to write a book all about rocket ships
Silly arguments over tofurkey bastings
I feel like Duke William in the Battle of Hastings

[Outro]
I feel like—
I feel like—
I feel like—
I feel like Duke William in the Battle of Hastings
