[Hook]
I am no longer afraid of the darkness
I can walk straight into apartments

[Verse 1]
My girlfriend drinks too many Bloody Marys and I'm a bloody mess
This is how people find marriage
And I have found the light at the end of the tunnel
I will yell Hellfyre Club through seventeen muzzles
If you wanna fight me you'll need seventy muscled men
Clad in the finest chainmail
Chain links click spam filter
My how time makes man shrink
Ego, id, FLAC, lossless files
The demands of this modern life
My boss is the arbiter of strife
But I am my own employer so that can't be right
Too scared to ask Kone for what beats are left
I should have gone to school to become a pizza chef
Whoa
I slung a bandolier of granola bars
And drank a basin of frozen stars

[Hook]
I am no longer afraid of the darkness
I can walk straight into apartments

[Bridge]
I screamed out Ishmael, right before my visions failed
I've forgotten how I read in Braille
This bread is stale
This bread is stale
And you will hide your face when I've decided it is my turn

[Verse 2]
Panic attack rap for my weirdness
Fit nerd urchins third person narrative structure
The fairy tale's ruptured like veins on fat people
I'm no royalty, I just act regal
Daydreams of bald eagles
A Wittgensteinian analysis of Busdriver's pulmonary palimpsest
I'm just another member of the choir singing too loud
Singing out of key, singing 'til his vocal chords threaten to burst
Never wanted the lesson to hurt
I busted the urn with the ashes of my ancestors
My friend is deader than a doorknob, poor slob
I would have prayed but I didn't want to force god, to pick sides
What a sick ride when I roll up on my
When I roll up on my
When I roll up on my
When I roll up on my zephyr
Like I was son of Goku, Gohan
I swear my frame has too many photons
Sacrilegious throwing empty chip bags at pigeons
Mig Welder, felt my insides turn quicksilver
My wit's been pilfered
I don't give nil, sir
Let me sell snack foods on train rides
I will give pep talks to black dudes and scared brides
These are my people, singing out of key hymnals

[Outro]
You can kill each one of my best friends
And I will write them songs on my palms like I didn't fucking notice
