[Verse 1]
Bipartisan like bayonet or javelin
Would gladly quit if posed with riddle: "pay my rent or rap again"
Grocer nostrum, sip colostrum quick, flip
Reverse mortgages to stoner kids, smorgasbord sorcerer
Repeat and court, hold heat in JanSport
Gallop off on khaki Percheron, touch ceiling as nappy Bergeron
Couldn't afford Harrison, behind a wooden door garrison
Hoping time would grant you amnesty, pan-handler philanthropy

[Chorus]
When the hum become the hymnal
When the hum become the hymnal
When the hum become the hymnal
The job of resurrectors is to, raise the dead
The job of resurrectors is to, raise the dead

[Verse 2]
Auto-dictate my didact
Vocab like a bar-fight with Gary Gygax
I got this life-threatening heart disease
That won't let me forget anything
Nizamuddin hunched at the embroidering machine
You need a merit badge and
You need a merit badge and
You need a merit badge
Locum tenens quit the hopeless tenant
As if honesty could mean, "Withhold a sentence"
It's arduous being so overzealous
There are people who find it unbearable to use coupons
It could be nonsense, sure, or clerical nuance

[Bridge]
I don't know how one makes cocaine powder to rock
I struggle with my blues like Eagle "Bones" Falconhawk
Fighting five Ted Danzigs at once
The author chokes and I forget myself

[Chorus]
(Goodbye) When the hum become the hymnal
(Goodbye) When the hum become the hymnal
(Goodbye) The job of resurrectors is to raise the dead
The job of resurrectors is to raise the dead

[Instrumental Outro]
