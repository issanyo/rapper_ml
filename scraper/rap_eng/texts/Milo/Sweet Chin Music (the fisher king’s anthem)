[Verse 1]
I wanted to hold palaver on U-Stream with Black Gallagher
Float down the river when I couldn't paddle much further
Ricky Steamboat got up on a two count after a Stone Cold Stunner
Heard the theme music and said: "Oh, boy, that's a real bummer"
I still dance when I hear that sweet chin music
Repeat the same sins fluid
Sit tight while the caveman de-thaws
Announce my presence like Bonesaw McGraw
Laid on my back, the bright lights circling
I am not Hercules, not even a distant relative
Open Mike tried to tell me that this is all relative
But I have found objective truths
In egg fried rice and fruits
I'm Piston Hondo, bruh
Floating down the canal in a beat up gondola
I'll poison the aquifer with awkward non-sequiturs
I'll enter just to exit, now repeat back that message, sir

[Hook]
I'd like to be a better man
I'd like to be a better man
Get better at making sandwiches
Perfect my figure four leg lock to deal some damages
Cut my afro locks off to brandish wages
The wild caveman's been trained to be slavish

[Verse 2]
Coded DNA fables sent by splintered RCA cable
Red, white, and yellow, bellied like avid camp enthusiasts
I stay hella smelly, a limp wrist, imperfectionist
Interjects a kiss over the samples, hiss
And that's a lot of S words
Get nervous when I have to navigate those breast curves
I'm just an awkward little boy still
That Chinese food money keeps my bill fold bulge, for real
I'll hit up Lebron for a verse
Before I upload myself to the Tron universe
You MAWGs worry about sagging jeans and street cred
I'll worry about hyperbeams and being derezzed
Sit at a desk in a kilt like I'm Rowdy Roddy Piper
Playing Delta Force 3 as team sniper
And yes, I am wearing a headset
And all my best friends, I talk to them on TeamSpeak
And all my heroes are professional wrestlers
I don't feel the need to be the best thing ever

[Outro]
Who can shout louder from the watchtower
Who can shout louder from the watchtower
Who can shout louder from the watchtower
Who can shout louder from the...
