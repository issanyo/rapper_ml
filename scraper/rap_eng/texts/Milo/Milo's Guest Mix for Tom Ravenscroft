Uh, scallops hotel came in with the pointy hat *brrrap*
I lost, I lost
I went in hot, stormed the BBC, I went in hot
Scallops hotel is the building
Thought I knew the game but
You see I lost, you see I lost, you see I uh
I was sure I could beat it
In the desert you can’t remember your name
I rode in on a horse with no
And I lost, and I lost, and I lost, and I lost

You are presently rocking with the corduroy coon prince
R.a.p. ferreira, the ignoble poet
The one known as milo, Black Orpheus, scallops hotel, celes king III

Not quite live but something similar to it
From the Afrolab 9000 located in Soul Folks Record
We are transmitting from blue satellite
Thank you for tuning in
Scallops hotel is the building
Four walls and a ceiling
It’s something like a feeling
It’s something like a feeling

Scallops hotel, fours walls and a ceiling
It’s something like a, it’s something like a, it’s something like a
I lost
Say it with us, say it with us
I thought I had the game figured out
And I lost, and I lost, went to the garden, and I lost
Say it with us, and I lost
Say it with us, I lost
Ruby yacht, Soul Folks
Transmitting from a blue satellite
Much love to Tom Ravenscroft
Much love, much love, it’s all love
True true right right, brother
True true right right

Seeming infinite shadow and act

[part III]:

They want that realness
Scallops hotel, they want that realness
Smooth as butter
(it’s the corduroy coon prince)
They want that realness

I’ve travelled many places
I have found that many people are searching for realness
We cannot help but to believe that we are living in a phony society in a phony society
We are living in a phony age in a phony age

Heard the ruby yacht and was looking for an actual boat
They heard the ruby yacht and was looking for an actual boat
They heard ruby yacht and was looking for an actual boat
Like the poet’s first spell ain’t metaphor nevermore
Ashy ancient speak, nascent cellar dweller, one yeller fella
Bedazzled, they want that realness, they want that realness

I’ve travelled many places
I have found that many people are searching for realness
We cannot help but to believe that we are living in a phony society in a phony
We are living in a phony age in a phony age

In a actual factual
We coming to you, highly melaninated
We coming to you, radiant and resplendid
We coming to you, really real
R-B-Y-T, the arch of bones
Transmitting from Soul Folks
What’s that, my brother
What’s that, my brother
What’s that

I’ve travelled many places many places
I have found that many people are searching for realness
We cannot help but to believe that we are living in a phony society
We are living in a phony age

Go ahead and get your ism prepared
Go ahead we just leaving the mic hot
You rocking with the Soul Folks on this one y’all

Left-handed shadow style
Shingen-ryu scallops hotel is the building
Four walls and a ceiling
Something like a, something like a
Something like a feeling

Scallops hotel is the building
Four walls and a ceiling
Something like a feeling

Eyes like a starry [?]

Images that spun and exploded reflecting visions of three

(scallops hotel exclusive
Jackers will get slapped)
Let us have eagles among my people
The hot wind is melted
Ice, and the ice has fallen
The cold wind chiseled mountains
And they have fallen
The dry wind has gnawed
Away stone, and stone is sand
The cruel winds have cut feathers
Skin and bones, sparrows have died
Let us have new wings among my people
Let us have bones among my people
Let us have visions among my people
Let us ride the high wind into the high country
Let us have equals, let us have equals
Vodu green clenching his waist
Obi purple wringing his neck
Shango, god of the spirits
Whispering in ear
Thunderlight stabbing island
Blood rising from skull
Mojo bone in fist
Strikes the sun from eye
Iron claw make wrist
Recalls rites of strength
Carved upon the chest
Black flame
Tongue of glass, ripple
River sweat
That’s right you heard it first
Strike the island, strike the sun
Strike the eye of evil, strike the guilty one
Strike the island, strike the sun
Strike the eye of evil, strike the guilty one
No power can stay the mojo
When the obi is purple and the vodu is green
And Shango is whispering, bathing in blood
I am not clean, I am not clean
No power can stay the mojo
When the obi is purple and the vodoun is green
And Shango is whispering, bathing in blood
I am not clean, I am not clean
I am not clean


[part VIII]:

Scallops hotel, ignoble peon poet
R.a.p. ferreira, residing
Egyptian magician with a stacked deck
We do welcome you to the lobby
Of the building known as a feeling
Thank you for tuning in

Lyrics like blood, capillaries
Flesh has grown dull at the ears now
Flesh has grown pale and lazy
Flesh has sinned against the Father
If flesh would listen I would warn him
That the spirits are displeased
And are planning what to do with him
But flesh thinks I am dead, charred, gone
Flesh thinks that by fire he can kill
Thinks that with metal teeth I die
Thinks that chaining me in alien temples
With new cards, carved upon my skin
Thinks that all the voices linked from [?] are silenced
Thinks that by cutting me down
I will sing and dance no more
But flesh is lazy and clogged with fat
Flesh does not know that he
Did not give me life
Flesh does not know that he
Did not give me life
“possessed like the exorcist”
That is what the spirits are singing now
It is time that flesh bow down on his knee
The fire bird has come again
Trees blow red where once green
Patterned the summer wind
The great oak hugging my window
Sheds, and shakes with shivering fingers
Every year the guard bird comes
It is not his beauty that I meditate
Rather his awesome message I
Burn them up now
Someday I will get you
The temple is filled today
A solemn white cloud
Trows the village
Yesterday I would not have gone to the temple
But today, today the temple is filled
There is no shouting today
The people are bowing in temple
And long eared cattle will not eat hill grass
Until the temple is empty
The dogs will not bark at the sheep
Until the temple is empty
The streets of colored sea rock will not shine
Until the temple is empty
The children who sing to the fisherman will not sing
Until the temple is empty
The old priest who stutters and nods at the gate will not stutter and nod
Until the temple is empty
The young girls who wear bright red and yellow
And the men who chase them will not laugh and fling their arms into the air
Until the temple is
Until its tempting, until its empty
For the sun will not have shined again
Until death himself has passed away
Thank you Henry, thank you Henry
Those were some very beautiful words
Thank you Henry, thank you for that reading Henry

[part X]:

Of the lotus, I am shaking by the lotus
Break me, break me
A mirage is the mask he wears heavy
Through the window of the dream
I see the wide sea
Shimmering like firey on the horizon’s beat
He sits indifferent pirate-y
Counting all eyes that see beyond his mask
Of the lotus I am
Annointed by the lotus
Of the lotus, wake me, wake me
Before we sleep, before we dream
Somnus often it
Perhaps I have never eaten whale
Nor has a whale eaten me
Perhaps I’ve never been in any kind of jail
But of the lotus, I have eaten of the lotus, of the lotus
When must I break you
When must I break you
I’ve made, I’ve made demi-gods
Of the ages where drunken lovers fall
Ere to myth, sages, philosophy, and science
Two sails billowed by the wind
Two faces like ours
Wrestling with the sea
Across the island I carried my soul
As one would carry a tiny baby
Found starving and dying
[?] skin shedding [?] of the rotting world
My voice walks like a skeleton
I’ve reached the edge of lagoon
Protected in the curve of the title rhythms
Beating down my bones
The island is appeared
Floating perhaps beckoning me
To its water free of beasts
Our voices are saying to our voices
I am the center in a sense
I am the sun, out of me comes everything
I am the center in a sense
I am the sun, out of me comes everything
