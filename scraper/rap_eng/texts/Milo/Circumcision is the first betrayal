[Verse 1: Elucid]
Brown sugar rolled oats
Secret shows at Soulfolks
Nostrum Grocer already told you
My next tape a KPop crossover
Addressed to bosom, shield that’s so true
Freak the Hammer dance on the high sea
Oh I can just kill a man
No jurisdiction on scottfree
Hock squeeze
Imma let them white boys shoot it out
‘Cause I ain’t got the time
With face that composed
Rest to be punk
I’m a nurtuous mind
You can’t call yourself an ally, if we don’t
I tried about Babylon, ponderin’ cycle of completion
Seven seconds in hell and then release it
In the days of finality where one must possess some kind of alchemy
‘Cause they MO is crush, kill, destroy
Airport music for the perpetually detained
Burn it all away for a step toward change
I’m no fatalist
Real Black, like save the bacon grease
Somebody out praying for me
I’m dealin’ with a feeling
I’m dealin’ with a
I’m dealin’ with a
I’m dealin’ with a
I’m dealin’ with a
I’m dealin’ with a
I’m dealin’ with a

[Chorus]
(He shall receive)
God playing goons to kill time all the time (He shall receive)
God playing goons to kill time all the time (He shall receive)
God playing goons to kill time all the time (He shall receive)

[Verse 2: Milo]
Would it be fitting to sing a requiem as the trapdoor closes?
Redundant like Black Moses, Abomunist newscast
I’m watching wide eyed eatin’ a gallon of Moose Tracks
Consistency is prison
Luddite in gabardine and linen
Videlicet, the derelict left butterscotch smears and chapel perilous
When the blues come dressed as an introspective echo
What if I write circuses to poets smoking nervousness, nervously?
Specialization is tyrannical, most certainly in my egg carton palace
Palm a MAWG’s skull and spin it like an atlas
An adder named Barabbas, I sip from the chalice
Budding ornithologists are weary of tired analogies
Budding ornithologists are
Budding ornithologists are weary of tired analogies
Budding ornithologists are weary of tired analogies

God playing goons to kill time all the time
God playing goons to kill time all the time
God playing goons to kill time all the time
