Bell Hooks believes Beyonce's a terrorist
And I'm Updating my working definition of "Very Best"

I am not the best rapper
None the less I'm just stunting like my daddy, though
Watching Mighty Boosh, doing lunges on the patio

I am not the best rapper
I got some problems, various in sundry
My name should be Cornelius, I should farm mung beans

I am not the best rapper
I wear a mustache like old Rustin Cohle
Paired with a coogi sweater from Cliff Huxtable

I am not the best rapper
Most days I sorta wanna be dead
Rap albums couldn't afford me quart of water, pita bread

I am not the best rapper [x2]

Wait up!

You can't stop when a hand write on your fan site
Cause defending my beliefs is how I learned how to dance-fight
No, I am not the best rapper
No, I'm not the best rapper

This is a thought experiment out of the shark tummy
So tell your dad's bridge partners mired in dark money
That I am not the best rapper, or rap whore[?]
Dork[?] booker of a rap tour who's excitable on cash poor
Less KimYe, more Kimchi
Less interplay, more synergy


No, I am not the best rapper
In fact, I'm your least favorite rapper

Whoa, yeah
Whoa, yeah

Oops! You probably don't have my playing card
Cause in 1997, I turned the football field to graveyard
... I'm no one's favorite rap dude
Let's Go!
