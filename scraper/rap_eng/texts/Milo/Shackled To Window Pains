[VERSE 1: Graves 33]
Waking up to the...
Fog and groggy, breakfast without the hogs meat
My thoughts have lost me yesterday them blooms was
Blossoming
But now we’re clocks to bleed. My god its oddities oddly I
Knew I’d have days like this, open up my windows
In congested, head full of mustard innuendoes
No more, Lorenzo sitting pipe dreams, benzotium
Consortium conquest
Hitting a dark hiatus. parade is leaving town, circus ring
Leaders got a serpent
Lurking, weazing, the ground is shifting and once I couldn’t
ﬁnd my passport keys and remote
I pray to the lord of complacent faces
Told 'em I’m condemned to the basement til he could send
A sun ray
Some day we’ll be able to face it
