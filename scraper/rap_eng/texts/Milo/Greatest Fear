[Verse 1: The Wilde]
I’m scared that my sheets will swallow me in my sleep and suck me down deep
Into the depths of despair
When I regain consciousness I’ll be astonished if I don’t need a gas mask to breathe the air
Every new song will be factory made and we’ll accept our doomed fate as fact that remains
Then earthquakes and hurricanes will rattle the nation and we’ll pretend not to know why the affected locations
Are mostly filled with the urban poor and there’ll be a plan to fix it that congress won’t vote for
And more and more we’ll notice mass media is fruitless and our noble quest for new stuff has rendered us useless

And I can’t do shit
And I can’t do shit
And I can’t do shit

[Verse 2: The Wilde]
My hands in my pockets touring the apocalypse and watching all the rocket ships fly away
All the important people sent to space, Bill Gates, Jay-Z, the president, the Yankees
And frankly, no one will ever even look for me, left off the shuttles with no book to read
Think my ideas fell on deaf ears and cold hearts, I’m scared I’m unoriginal my best years had no spark
This fear trumps resilience I’m anything but brilliant my life is a joke whose delivery is killing it
Afraid I won’t prevent this or even make a difference and this song will echo my entire existence

And I can’t do shit
And I can’t do shit
And I can’t do shit

[Verse 3: The Wilde]
When my pen’s out of ink and my heads out of verses I’m hoping I’ll be over that fear
And maybe one day if you hear what I say, you can finally fall asleep head clear

[Verse 4: milo]
That’s a dead deer
Ahem
Maybe perhaps i can't do shit
But i certainly can dual wield q-tips
And clean smudges off miniature armoires
And give gatekeepers with stiff hands, arm bars
I'm not scared of the dark
Or to wave my freak flag around the creeps at the park
Watch me translate anguish with a beat pad
Watch me cultivate the hairline of Charlie Sheen's dad
That seems rad and fear is dumb
Wear sheer leggings that reveal your bum
Don't call back those bill collectors
Don't find jobs in the private sector
Grow oranges, change your name to Hector
Avoid buying knives from vector
Et cetera, et cetera
Decorate the dark hallways with poinsettias
Don't befriend people called trendsetters
Because they're liars and fibbers black hat spies and Indian givers
Be generous with thai food deny the antecedent
And give stink eyes to guys who are rude

It's that easy
It's that easy
It is absolutely that easy
