[Verse 1 - Milo]

The wound is the place where the light enters
So I stuck my right paw in an ice blender
I tend to ruin something nice and delicate
I've got the wingspan of several mighty pelicans
It seems like every asshole in the multi-verse
Has found their life's purpose in the multi-verse
So I got down on these ashy knees
And begged forgiveness for the same blasphemies
That I'd finger painted with pap smear yeast
And bloggers had called my masterpiece
But they couldn't pronounce it right
I'm feeling mad anxious, cranky and boneheaded
Home alone with some filthy animals and we're undressing
The subtext to a stressful lesson
Like I used to skip my string instrument sessions

Inhale deeply, thought I smelled the cedars of Lebanon
Mistook my notebook as Flowers For Algernon

Dark storms, thunder and mad lightning
IPhone Notepad app don't look like my handwriting
I couldn't see you with my moon goggles
Now I run art rap, it's a boondoggle and it seems right
I think I'm Steve Reich
They called me Steve Urkel
But now I'm Prince Nelson, and my cloak's purple
I dare say you act funny
I'm drowning out your poopy rap songs with Thomas Pynchon audiobooks that I bought with rap moneys
Don't sound so surprised when
I tell you I'm Mr. Mojo Risin'

[Verse 2 - Nocando]

My heart shattered the shards in my shirt pocket
Knuckle all scarred from sparring inert objects
Shots in my collar and I call into work tardy
My counterpart called me to party in her body
Guest list, guess I won't stand in line
And she got a door man, what kind of man am I
Brass knuckles on the hands of time
Oh, baby, did they bust my lip, did they black my eye
Did they crush my dream, did they smash my pride
Did they change my trajectory, nah nah nah
See, I'm zen like the Dalai Lama
Ignite the marijuana magic wand and Cali ganja
If I tell a lie it's whiter than Obama's mama
Had to lay that just been delighted with dodging drama
My nigga, my Nietzsche won't acknowledge karma
I'm feeling so sublime all the time
Rest in peace Brad
Sleeping by yourself at night makes you feel like a sleazebag
Reading by yourself at night makes you write pretty deep raps
And these raps, make these pretty bitches pull out the knee pads
And pray to the god of Hellfyre, wherever the that fuck he's at
But Jimmy's here with a set of blood diamond tipped tweezers
Pulling blackhead magic out of Jimmy's beard
Watching these normal niggas behave pretty weird
Now I'm a normal nigga, and that's pretty weird
