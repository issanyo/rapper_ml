When I meet the man up top
I will bargain for nothing
And I will accept my lot
Among those who are suffering (x4)

Yesterday my car died and with it my dignity
So I can bear all like a Greek sculpture sans fig leaf
If I were to cover up, I assure you it'd be a big wreath
I've burned Nag Champa but I've never hit the peace pipe
I've been far too concerned with getting my moral peace right
There was a time where I was the freshest dude on JV B squad
And the kids that I went to school with were uptight like PVC rods
I thought I could define my blackness with a sports team
Needless to say, that was quite the short dream
I went from nigga to nigga in a small timeframe
But this was all before the giant eyeglasses came
I assume this is why I identify with Bruce Wayne
It's a shame that I never had a jump shot
And a video is the only time I've ever pumped Glocks
I've convinced many a lass to inspect her nudes
Under the guise of moral rectitude
I'm not the dude you should lecture to

I've got these elaborate daydreams of picking mangos
The reality is I spend too much time surfing BangBros
It's staggering, I'm a blabbering Bilbo Baggins
Ordained in piety-wrapped factions as captain
I'm a despondent Howard Moon
Trapped in an ornate flowery tomb with powdery-blue
Dancing shoes pissing in urinals taking time to decode the etchings
Skipping class is one of life's fine little blessings
Reading Schopenhauer and feeling mad dense
That I neglected to snag chips off Adsense
Chatting with girls with shirts that are mildly see-through
Asking myself if Rob was here, what would he do?

Staring at my ex-girlfriends Facebook photos
Negates that all these blog nods make me feel like Glen Coco
Which is cooler: a write-up on Forbes
Or to be running a top ranked guild on Horde
My mother named me Rory after a dude who was assassinated
I've got potentials that may never be actuated
I've something like the nerdy dude ambassador
With the Fishscale tape banging loud in the Flux Capacitor

When I meet the man up top
I will bargain for nothing
And I will accept my lot
Among those who are suffering (x4)
