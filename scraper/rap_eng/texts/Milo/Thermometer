[Verse 1: Elucid]
Sea salt over left shoulder
No weapon formed, I done told ya
Fuck what it take to get on, I’m getting over
Float the rock, shoot yo shot, skim cream off top, cosmic slop
Fifty two hand block this snot box, we go rock stop for why
Baby cry hoarse Selassie I, world of pain
Uncertain time we’re locked away, we’re locked away
But joy today for me and mine
It’s hard to say that every rising of the sun
Now and again I’m reminded like I’m dumb
They'll only remember science if it’s sung
Other side of time they say he from
Climb the ladder, grease the rung
Grease the rung, climb the ladder
Stone mountain camo, this the burning of Atlanta
Senator’s daughter geeking in a bando
Chicken wing, licking thigh from Nando’s
She go where the bang go
Poverty is a crime
Yes you get cancelled wrinkled bank notes
Who got ganked, bro? Move as I say so
Serpents in rank bolts and plain clothes, throwing bones in the [?]
I’m on, I’m on
I’m on, I’m on
I’m on, I’m on
I’m on, I’m on
I’m on, I’m on
I’m

[Verse 2: Milo]
I’m on
Lied about writing in iambic pentameter
A lot of rappers are scared of thermometers
Twinkle toes repose, repertoire catastrophic
Rappers need business insurance, the vision gets blurred
Cookie-faced and paranoid trying to buy a high chair
Trying to buy more time on Earth to avoid the job fair
Aerial Toll House, nary a bold mouse could hold this cat
Was once tee-totaler, now pees in peepholer
Back to the task at hand
Ro’ stuck emoting stone-faced like Alpaca Man
Ro’ glare like a bastardized cat scan
Sweaty palms when you dap the man, like Dat Phan, or Kim dotcom
Rapped it like Sinbad’s sitcom, who’s the mark?
Pill box cocked in Pilsen hot
Spouting out Robert Anton Wilson to the block
The whole point was to make ‘em say it back to me
Spent my time on this mortal coil floating
Natural enemy to any O'Doyle gloatin’
All uniforms was plant-dyed
Nostrum Grocers by a landslide, Nostrum Grocers by a landslide
I’m Mélisande Colomb on my first day
You would swear on everything you want it in the worst way
Don’t be scared to bleed and smear mud in it
Here we go with yesteryear's reductionist, ay
Trajectory franking massive, cart playing chess on a sinking asterisk
Suppose, the opponent’s only self
Ronin boasts well on a half-shell, and pray they never have to prove it
Neo hoodooist, this rhythm be nature’s cure all
Neo hoodooist
