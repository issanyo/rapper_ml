[Verse 1]
A great swell of energy like a Hadron Particle Collider
You look like my fear of water slides personified
Finding Beauty, Bigby in a cornfield
If I'm phony now, I can remember I was born real
Threw that self-help jargon in my spam folder
Then set to explore the monster like Bram Stoker
Whereof one cannot speak, thereof one must be silent
But I yawned and I burped and I passed gas loudly
