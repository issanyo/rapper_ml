These are
Henry Dumas' Thoughts

Love came to me and said:
What do you want of me?

Save me I said, Save me
Love knelt down beside me and said:

If you knew the price
Of coming to you

You would ask nothing
But would give

I flew into the country of the mind
And there my wings froze

I fell
Thought sculptured me in stone

You're lying, said memory
You're asleep, said forgetfulness

Hate is also creative
It creates more hate

With an eyelash I etched
Your form upon the moon

The sun bending over the basins of
My eyes this morning washed my hands
