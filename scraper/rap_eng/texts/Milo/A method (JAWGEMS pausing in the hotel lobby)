[Intro: milo]
Mace Windu, [?]
Real purple lightsaber shit
Drop it

[Verse 1: milo]
I find myself in the same place
Aimlessly wandering systemic violence with amazing grace
On my second life like Lazarus or John the Baptist
I remember Granny read that passage with bated breath
I do life most comfortably on the razor's edge
You will never hear anyone from my family is underfed
I brought a gun to the knife fight for Wonder Bread
I keep your hero in a cave like a cyclops
But the crowd prefer that mind rot, I just spit that eye drop
A noob with a jaw full of gems for your saibot
Seto Kaiba with a high-top, yeah
Like the lovely sun of autumn
I'm speaking coyly to my honey-dip in Gotham like:
"I'm prepared to commit a wickedness
So you might retain that shine"

[Chorus: milo]
Keep it clean
But there's this hole in me, I keep it—
But there's this hole in me
I got this hole in me, I got this—

[Verse 2: milo]
Pigeon-toed with a stutter step, known to hide a rapper's skull
In the same cupboard where the china's set
Scarf a green jelly bean, parts the meaning in all things
I grew weary of the praise that art brings
Shit, part king of the darklings
Yeah, yeah, manifests self under a cloak of self-importance
While I juggle with my organs, shit

[Outro: milo]
Yeah, we have one who makes a necessity out of virtue
"Tighten the noose," said the stool kicker
Neither a healer nor a wizard, and that's the kicker
Neither a healer nor a wizard, and that's the kicker
"Tighten the noose," said the stool kicker
"Tighten the noose," said the stool kicker
We have one who makes a necessity out of virtue
Who among us is not among us?
Who among us is not among us?
