[Intro]
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Wrap a flip in a zip
Like spot
A random topic
Say something again, say something again
Something, bitch, damn, damn

[Verse 1: SB The Moor]
Doing dishes watching my life go down the sinkhole
Didn't forget my name, that's how I know I gotta drink more
Stepped onto the stage forgot my cup wasn't a microphone
Then I looked out at the crowd before I rapped about my life alone
Now the only thing that knows my story is some drank wine
I only made ten dollars so I still don't pay the bank fines

[Verse 2: Milo]
Yo, still don't pay those bank fines
Overwhelmed by my numerous advantages, I'm
Overwhelmed by my numerous advantages
I know the best rap songs aren't
I know the best rap songs aren't cohesive thematically
My granddaddy say bad days come automatically
Ruby Yacht Redguard never heard saying woe is me
Floating, vapid, bloated, on the moulding poetry
He put the magic in my left hand

[Verse 3: SB The Moor]
Not in the right, not in the right
Legal tender make a nigga hard
I write all my advantages on a rap roleplaying game card
Legal tender tend to make a nigga hard
I write all my advantages on a rap roleplaying game card
Then I make a PB&J with only whole wheat
Subsist off that shit for a fucking whole week
Forget all of my nightmares and I let my soul sleep
I look into the abyss and the hole is deep

[Verse 4: Milo]
And the hole is deep
And the hole is deep
I like my hoes deep
I guess we're mobbing deep
While my own shallow soul feel like a quicksand pit
At the table of life like "Where's the mixed man sit?"
I know that heaven is the author of
I know that heaven is the author of the virtue in me
Copywrit by paupers who couldn't sense my urgency
Same street corner where the urchin shepherd lunacy
I know they want my secrets though
So I try to be humble, succeed at being average
On tour chewing hella elderberry tablets

[Verse 5: SB The Moor]
Like crunch crunch crunch
Where the fuck is my lunch
I wear a turtleneck rockin' and rollin' with only crew men
Dressed up like a pilot but I never have been proven
I never lost a limb or life I'm still at ninety-nine
I never had a mind to find a problem residing inside of my mind
I never had the time, or the earth
But my mom and pop were blessed with the fucking golden birth
And that's me

[Verse 6: Milo]
Yo
SB and I, two manic fucking Jedi
Hit the panic button and dip on the red eye
I'm Spike Speigel with those long legs
Thirteen, breakdancing with a bald fade
Life is such a vicious windmill
And you could lose your head, you could lose your head
You see, Life is such a vicious fucking windmill
You could lose your head
That would be unfortunate
If you lost your head, if you lost your head
If you lost your head, if you lost your head
