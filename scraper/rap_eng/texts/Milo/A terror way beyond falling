[Verse: milo]
Cue, yawning zeitgeist
Wack motherfuckers flounder for limelight
Ruby Yacht's magnificence is bioluminescence
Dispersed despair, there's a terror way beyond falling
Lackeys of finance, pullman porter of high-hats
This phone booth reserved for Clark Kent
I'm outta here on a starship, nigga
Outer space, motherfucker
Truthfully, I'm outta here on the first thing steaming
Caught you by surprise like Batista eating vegan
No smoking, no spitting read the sign from the management
Escapee of a prison planet
Where compliments were served underhanded
Nigga, it's a conspiracy to keep me ignorant
And I will exact retribution on all counts
Storm the bridge, I'm ripping banners from the wall mounts
So it go, I suppose, "that's how the ball bounce"
Telemachus sneezed
Paranoid about my Louis bodies
Not Louis loafs, such goofy oafs
What do we hopes, what do we hopes
What do we hopes, what do he hope?

[Chorus: milo]
And I know property is theft
And I know property is theft
But it's still some things I'm wanting
It's still some things I'm wanting
It's still some things I'm wanting
So I might take 'em, so I might —
So I might take 'em, so I might —
So I might take 'em

[Outro: milo]
It's Rain Man lawnmower, Tinker Toy soldier
Shit, I need a soldering iron
I'mma reverse-engineer my way outta here
I'mma reverse-engineer my way outta here
I'mma reverse-engineer my way outta here
Shade boogie rather close, and it's—
I'm on that—
I'm on that first thing steaming
I'm on that—
I'm on that first thing steaming
So hold my train, man, hold my—
Hold my train, man, hold my—
