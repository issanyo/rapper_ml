[Intro: milo]
Is this God talking?
Can you translate?
I was told that if God were talking there would be a translator
There is no trans - am I supposed to translate then?
I'll do my best

[Verse 1: milo]
Rap music is deep folk
I wear a green cloak like Gon, son of Ging
I'm conscious of this one thing
I dance on tip-toes like Mama Coss[?]
I don't read Ram Dass
Fearless sort of boy
In No Fear corduroys
Peerless otherwise with a pap smear [??]
Motherfucker, rhymes fly over backpacker beats
It's fuck a nine-to-five, I've disasters to eat

[Verse 2: milo]
Playing Mick Jenkins for strangers to watch their faces
I pretend I wash their faces
Lost in places, never in translation
There's never going to be a translation
My skull holds as much as a wicker basket can
Stone-faced and staring like alpaca man
I'm on tour in a packed rental van
Google image search "dental dam"
Then force quit Safari
Cut a record for two joysticks and an Atari
I'm an idiot

[Verse 3: milo]
The anonymous corroborator
You don't understand my functions like car carburetors
Oscillating awkward favors
Reading Sense and Reference
Don't have the sense to reference
The second-to-last winner of Donald Trump's Apprentice
Bill Gray demeanor
Had a nervous breakdown in Carl's Jr.'s over Carl Senior
The fourth man of The Ahmad Jamal Trio
Son of Mike Ladd whipping a Chevy Geo
Of course it was chartreuse
Said "milo's my favorite rapper, he only rhymes harsh truths"
I'm more of a calm bystander
Cold eye scanners try to trademark the stage banter
Groaning to roll out of a Toyota Sprinter
Never judge an Ayatollah by his whiskers
Sounds like he wrote his rhymes in whispers
It sounds like he wrote his rhymes in whispers
