["This is just the kind of place I've always imagined!"]

Happiness is probably happenstance
The magical rap negro, call me Bagger Vance
Armed with a shield of humility and a braggarts' lance
Used to pride myself in never using cheat codes or tips
This rap business is like Stirner's Union of Egoists
I've taken long walks in hot sand just to cry
Threatened a man's life and felt justified
It becomes a problem when you think that's glory
I've looked demons in the eye and introduced myself as Rory
["Oh Jiji, we can see the ocean from here!"]
My brothers;

A warped schooner in a sea of uninspired half-wits
Who morphed as a late bloomer into a codgy bullmastiff
Folks wanna know how I rap sans rhythms
I've got a pine inch nenis and a knack for spoonerisms
I've traveled the diameter of the sequoia grove
Made myself small enough to look down a cicada's nose
["We fly with our spirit."] Indeed

This morning, served myself a double portion of humble pie
I'm not trying to get over, it takes all my efforts to stumble by
These nerds in forums, like verily, we need 'em
Y'all better catch me before I catch Kerry Leatham
She's definitely not impressed by me since sixteen
You make a great house husband when you know how to fix things
More likely I'm Nietzsche's mustache personified
My heart is where bored, spritely women go to die
Living life as a decoration on your Christmas tree
Yelling over instrumentals and hoping that you'll pity me
Pretty please and with a big bag of sprinkles
I flirt over emails, I'm not equipped to go and mingle
I don't know a single thing about glass bowls
Which normally makes people think I'm some type of asshole

["Jiji, I've decided not to leave this town
Maybe I can stay and find some other nice people who will like me and accept me for who I am."]

Acceptance is a hell of a drug
And with a single utterance, I was rendered a slug
Not the hottest firecracker, but I'm surely no dud
Acceptance is a hell of a drug
And with a single utterance, I was rendered a slug
Not the hottest firecracker, but I'm surely...
["Trust in your spirit! Yes, yes! That's exactly what I'm talkin' about."]

I fell in love out by the Oxbow lake
And my stomach churned like it was full of cold snakes
We can admire these stars without learning their names
But I've got these fears I may never tame
It's one thing to bring dishonor to your whole family
A new kind of embarrassment, losing a fight with gravity
If I've only got dreams of rap star ascension
Why do I spend so much time on Latin noun declensions?

Acceptance is a hell of a drug
And with a single utterance, I was rendered a slug

And my stomach churned like it was full of cold snakes

But I've got these fears I may never tame

"Maybe I have to find my own inspiration."]
