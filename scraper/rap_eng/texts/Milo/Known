(Verse 1)
I just want you in my space
You're the perfect moon
You're beautiful in your way
We should rendezvous
Empty like a silhouette
Fill me with the truth
Music should be your escape
You'll be happy if you do

(Hook)
You shoulda known
Better

Chillin in the window seat
Landscapes are my therapy
Music is my recipe
You don't wanna mess with me
(yeah)
We know how to have a good time
This the part where I make you mine
Imma hit you with one sublime
Paint a Picture in your eyes
(yeah)
(Sub hook)
You got the gravy
You got the... X2
You got the gravy
(yeah)
They tryina tame me
Levels when they tryina faze me
(yeah)
X2

(Rap verse)
I got the juice
All you niggas wanna dilute
Boi LuE
I am the fruit
I am the tree
I bring the shade
Good music up in my roots
I am the truth
They been sleepin on me
Bed of lies
I'm not surprised
I'm preaching love
That's the person in the mirror who'll give you your piece of mind
(sing)
Don't sleep on yourself
There's value in your worth

(Poem by Esihle)
I mean I could've been good
Because I'm vital for others
But bad for you
Heck I'm bad for myself
But I'm their oxygen
Their life
But not for me or you
I'm made of iron and I'm
Corroding us both
You shoulda known better
