[Verse 1: Scallops Hotel]
The supreme architect lacks tact
I should've mumbled that
The corduroy coon prince returns
With two shits to give
Had to ask your man what the lyrics is
Who wrote the most sophisticated limericks in
No time at all
Having swallowed my doubts
I find myself here blabbering
To no one in particular
Is this wickedness?

Never worked in the office place as a stamp presser
I made this beat with the souls of my ancestors
Guiding my very nimble fingers
With closed eyes, I can feel my old earth linger

My little sister is a goddess
Her name is Isis;
She's still more modest than every rapper I know
I take a glance at my foes and chuckle quietly
Prison is a pedestal
I've been there writing from the other side
Writing from the other side of time which is ended
I'm stupid and even I find it stupendous
To be alive, to be alive, to be alive
Imagine that: to be alive and you squandered it
Debating which Pawn Star was awesomest
And I squandered it, debating why Schopenhauer was awesomest
And we felt no guilt, and we felt no guilt, and we felt no guilt
You were promised a rap parade

[Verse 2: DUNZO DONALDS]
Standing in the line
Who've I been all this time
Need no dollars where I'm going
Boing-boing, bounce with me
Confidence of a spiritual space traveler
I've been a real good passenger
Navigate my magic sir
No wands, no wants
Intentions are a different case
I can feel your thoughts from here in center space
Interface inter-spliced with positive energies
I spend it as I please
I believe in many things, I believe in many things
That's how I grew these wings
You can see me from below
Don't blink cause there he go
More like a Pegasus that could sprinkle Lego dust out
Watch you build it up, take it down, & start again
You can always start again
That's the beauty of it
I am the cosmos & I truly love it
True-oo and tell you do too-oo
Tell me you do-oo, oh-ee-oh-ee-oooh
And Groovy-groovy-groove
