[Verse 1: Elucid]
I accessorize with scrap metals
Out-of-barrel ghetto fellow, leave him the hell alone
Scorch the kettle, don't bother settled bones
First owned throne, black Othello
My man, my mellow maricón
Dulce tone on spastic drum-chop
Tongues spun clock-wise young thot faster
Pussy got killed to feed the loot
My city's a noose, runnin' outta room
Smoking by the tomb, holding onto a noose
Triple F.A.T. Goose for the element
LTIP you like safety cone
Clones approach but most won't shake the throne
Church Coltrane, take me home
Came around the long way, heard the horns say
Uh, interplanetary warning on my born day
Spit the core, talk shit like I read the script before
Score my flesh so you get got for less
I’m a hex-breaker for hire
Death like my play cousin, slap-box, flame, and fire
Back-block life for a rap-rock sightful
Please raise your rifles if you’re sure
If you’re sure

[Verse 2: Milo]
Funky flow for the perpetrators, impersonators
Curb the hatred
[?] come off absurdly basic
How you always spit the synonym? Grasp the dissonance
Nuance, the cinnamon
With yesterday’s Shoo-Bee-Wap
Gleamin’ on a Ruby Yacht
Where Roody-Poos routinely get rudely mopped
“Hootie Hoo!” is still what we scream at cops
Thieves guild, they beggin’ for refills on swag bags mawgs earn a mint off ASCAP, and
Act entitled to a ski mask
Had to front like I ain’t seen that
Celes King turn a being into a beanbag
Celes King turn the trap into a think tank
Celes King turn that vocab to a sweepstakes

[Outro: Milo]
Funky flow for the perpetrators, impersonators
Funky flow for the perpetrators, impersonators
