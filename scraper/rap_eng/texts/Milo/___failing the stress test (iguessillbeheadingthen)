[Verse 1]
Prefer my hecklers heavyweight
Make any assassin demonstrate the full gamus
Pose as scholars how they speculate so heavy-handed
My weapons list betrays expensive taste
The only appropriate reply is belly laughter and haste
Watching the past pass with the calm clairvoyance of disasters it makes
For many years we danced and took to crafts requiring quill and ink
Them who thought it was a superpower just to will or think
Build or sink, plot plan, issue decrees, dispatch decoys
And when I returned to Ithaca, they couldn’t recognize the b-boy
Decoder ring look like a cheap toy and I’m just sketching, uh

[Chorus]
I’m just sketching on flesh my perceptions of death
Rest, bless, sex, hep, stress test
I’m sketching on flesh my perceptions of death
Rest, bless, sex, hep, stress test

[Verse 2]
Zorro knelt hurting, the moral kept swerving
While I trudged the straight and thinning, in the mud I made a killing
While rappers went missing, reprise of the tied coon
Sunrise in the waiting room of the pediatrician
It’s hard to listen to your favorite song when the CD's skipping
When heroes is prone to victim blaming
Do it matter where the missile's aiming? (I think not)
I could never submit myself to a laser beam
Still wearing your initials, suppose I felt initial displacement
Official statement, there are no carvings in my hidden places
So what's it matter if my physical husk, niggas is dust
Anyway, lest we forget to beat the breath

[Chorus]
And I’m just sketching on flesh my perceptions of death
Rest, bless, sex, hep, stress test
I’m just sketching on flesh my perceptions of death
Rest, bless, sex, hep, stress test

[Verse 3]
I could never submit myself to a laser beam
Still wearing your initials, initial displacement has passed
Official statement, I laugh
How could I ever care about my body knowing it isn’t me, but mine?
Role felt like blind nigga samurai
I’m really that shit, I’m really that shit, and really it’s best
And really, it’s best, and really, it’s best

[Outro]
And really, it’s best, I do the beheading, and really it’s best
And really, it’s best, I do the beheading, and really it’s best
And really, it’s best, and really, it’s best, I do the beheading, and really it’s best
It’s best, I do the beheading, and really, it’s best
And really, it’s best I do the beheading, not energetic, at my behest
I think it’s best if I do the beheading, and really, it’s best
Really, it’s best, really, it’s best, really, it’s best
Really it’s best, pain up in the neck, really, it’s best
