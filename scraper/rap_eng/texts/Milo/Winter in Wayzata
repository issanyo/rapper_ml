The Farrow - Winter in Wayzata (prod. Milo)

[Intro]
People seldom do what they believe in
They just do what’s convenient and then repent
All I can do is be me, whoever that is
Cause some people feel the rain
Others just get wet
And you don’t need a weatherman to tell you which way the wind blows Or that it’s always winter in wayzata, forreal

[Hook]
When leaves fall and the lakes freeze I...
I gotta get ready for winter time, yeah
When leaves fall and the lakes freeze I...
I gotta get ready for winter time
Gotta find a girl with a bubble butt
Take her out, then cuff her up
Light a fire, let’s light a blunt
On-demand girl cuddle up
