[Verse 1: scallops hotel]
Niglet, nitwit, nitpick, myrrh with mystic goji
Morose is how we flip the allegory
Feet stuck to soil pine
Refusing to shuck or shuffle off this mortal coil for a fucking dime
Give me pause
Give me peace
Give me mind
Ain't seen you beyond time since
Found my way back
Tracing the echo at nine pence
Gleam like an embroidered knife
They hate how he hoard the type
Come from a time when the point was to be mighty morphin' like

[Chorus: scallops hotel]
That was the whole point
'Tis a sniper on that mansard roof
Nigga, I laugh just like Mandark do
Ah hahaha ah hahaha
Ah hahaha ah hahaha
'Tis a sniper on that mansard roof
Nigga, I laugh just how Mandark do
Ah hahaha ah hahaha
Ah hahaha ah hahaha

[Verse 2: s. al]
Origami paperfold
I was just outside of Naperville with a gaping whole in my ch-
Origami paperfold
I was just outside of Naperville with a gaping whole in my cheap shirt
I sew it up
But you need to open up
Like 24/7
My power grew out of regimen, and lots of estrogen
That's next of kin
I'm well fed and nestled in
I'll fucking flip a Nestle truck but save the driver
I'm not a murder club dope pedal rider
But papa said it's good to get this ink on my bicep
Won't find me in the street rocking the flyknit
Mom clipped coupons so I keep receipts
Mom clipped coupons so I keep receipts
Ha haha ha haha ha ha ha hahaha
Hahaha haha

[Verse 3: randall bravery]
Blessing starred a Black bastard smiling
Sunshine half second passes
Beats like hat tricks
Imma bum a ride out this vicious cycle
Every pale one reminds me of Bale's psycho
Hands in prayer like mantis, anthem of bandits
Something for the anxieties
Love when you lie
Herb tastes like Welch's
Smoke cloud with these belches
Transcripts was retrograde or more
But her mans is at the corner store
Health in a reservoir
Reaching a mana well
American life is hell
Dynamite neon
Never been a peon
Haha haha ha
Hahahaha ha

[Chorus: scallops hotel]
'Tis a sniper on that mansard roof
Nigga, I laugh just how Mandark do
Ah hahaha
