I woke up a blind man like I was borges
Trapped in a four by four force field maze
Someone had taken the time to hang klimt paintings
In the middle of this labyrinth jack dempsey is waiting
In the dark with a mirror plotting my career arch
A bumbling idiot of a heresiarch

I might fear the dark
Help me (x2)

Superstitious with a vial of falcon piss
I've been trained in an unknown calculus

I am wandering (x2)
(wandering)

I've got the symbols. tokens and talismans
Broad shouldered like a Diablo 2 paladin
My life is a palindrome for Saladin
The enemy looks like Alec Baldwin
You can't tell cos he wears a mask of false skin
When did I become Diogenes again
I'm a skeptic cynic
The wounds get infected when the septics in it
The exodus; genesis, sega
Sacrifice the cannibal ox like vordul mega
Go ahead and make a mockery of this
I'll stick to the atoms like I'm democritus

I floated
Up into the noumenal realm
My mind is a camera with no usable film
Here's a polaroid of android sheep (x2)
Blog accolades
Iron man band aids
How many is too many melatonin pills
My cerebellum's growing still
I don't want to shake your hands
Exuding the 32 signs of the great man
Notice how my brow meets
I'm, standing strong on webbed feet
I've, been longing for bread to eat
I'll, sip the crystal pure oblivion
Spent my whole life a law abiding citizen
My teeth are coated with granola
My pockets are bulging with spinoza
I wouldn't say I set the fire
I'm the zookeeper of the electric tigers

I heard the feasting horn
So I answered the call
Type of dude to do the rain dance
For us all (x2)
