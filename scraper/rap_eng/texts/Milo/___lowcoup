[Verse]
Du-du-du-du, du-du-du-du, Duke of Earl
And how he spit get felt all across the world
Du-du-du-du, du-du-du-du,Duke of Earl
And how he spit get felt all across the world
Like it ain't nothing, like it ain't, yeah, yeah
Like it ain't nothing, like it ain't, yeah, yeah, yeah
Like it ain't nothing, like it ain't, yeah, yeah, yeah
Like it ain't nothing, like it ain't nothing, nah, nah
Like it ain't nothing
Lickety split is my custom, arms like a fat violinist
My squad got two goons and a biochemist
Nigga, I'm the documentary maker
Writing verse with getaway car enthusiasm
Ooh, it's in him, ooh, it's in him
Ooh, it's in him, uh, ooh, it's in him
Why he'll-he'll bet they feel it now
Bet they feel it now
Duende smuggler's lair, we cooking with grease now
Kente rug for prayer, we cooking with grease now
Spirit dancing long ago and later
Closes the eyes and enters the makeshift movie theater
Holding bean pies, kicking freestyles with waiters
Du-du-du-du, du-du-du-du, du-du-du-du, du-du-du-du
The Duke of Earl
And how he spit get felt all  across the world
Du-du-du-du, du-du-du-du, Duke of Earl
And I freaked it
