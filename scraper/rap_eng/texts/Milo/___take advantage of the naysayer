[Verse 1]
I'm the type of nigga to wear protective layering
Preaching loudly about the journey and the laboring
I just to want to die in the name of something great
Now, I don't wanna die at all
I wanna grow and expand and consume whole galaxies
A strong black man, moonlights as a cattle thief
A strong black man, two stepping through banality
A strong black man, who can't seem to grasp the handling
Of reality, dog
With its peaks and valleys
And peeling wallpapers and bald haters
Everything smells like staircase piss
There's white people on spaceships, bare chests and face lifts
It's all horrifying
And I'm caught codifying my at-home deities
Eating banana pupusas on Regan's couch again

[Hook]
Listen to the Method Man song
But act like my dad is asking those questions
Is it real, son? Is it really real, son?
Do you know the deal, son? Is it really real?
Something you can feel, son?
You want the raw deal son?
You want the raw deal, son?

[Verse 2]
Honestly, who can say?
I remember the art museum where Mike Eagle found Dubuffet
I remember Meredith blessing me with Jean Genet
And blowing my old life kisses, bombs away
I remember packing an apartment into the three bags
And driving across God's kneecaps to Lord knows where
I'm more bored than scared
How I learned to portion the orphan's share or be the burden bearer
Working titles of my autobiography:
I'm Probably Not the Rapper for You
It's all love, it's all love

[Hook]
Listen to the Method Man song
But act like my dad is asking those questions
Is it real, son? Is it really real, son?
Do you know the deal, son? Is it really real?
Something you can feel, son?
You want the raw deal, son?
You want the raw deal, son?
You want the raw deal, son?
You want the raw deal, son?
If it's real, son
If it's real, son
If it's real, son

[Outro]
Rode in on a Ruby Yacht, that's an Ark of...
That's an Ark of Bones
That's an Ark of Bones
That's an Ark of Bones
Had to ask him, "Why you fill me with these dark ass poems?"
