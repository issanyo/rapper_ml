[Intro]
My transmissions began
When diamond said to coal:
"Why so yielding?"
A journey
The valley of quest
The valley of love
The valley of understanding
The valley of independence
The valley of unity
The valley of astonishment
The valley of deprivation
The quest
You leave home
The important part is you leave home

[Verse]
Left home in search of where the orchid grows
Found a lotus pond in Echo Park and got confused
Met an Aristotelian and got to press him 'bout his awkward views
Why you so quick to divide? So hasty, devise and cut in two
Knowing it's impolite to tarry, I went about my way
And I don't like scary niggas so I ain't been around the way
Picking spinach out my teeth from the (Florentine)
Hold this notebook like an advanced new camera
The panorama makes me some kind of past-master
Gawking at the pasture as I pen this, it hails
The Howitzer in the garden of my (mind)
It isn't always so reliable
Earthworm nimrod preaching about survival
And the orchestral nature of chaos
Lurking in the numbers, burping penumbra
How gracefully he fidgets with the ephemeral

[Outro]
A peon wrote this with the stalk of a peony
And a collar of primitive thud
Posing by a bust of Pericles eating fudge
Sun officiating, dugoobie fashion
Seen his hands fasten 'round the ruby hilt of that old, rusty scimitar
Speaking time-tested code to who the other rhythm wizards are
God bless the soul of whoever you think you are
God bless the soul of whoever you think you are
God bless the soul of whoever you thought you was
'Cause it
'Cause it might not be no next (time)
'Cause it might not be no next (time)
