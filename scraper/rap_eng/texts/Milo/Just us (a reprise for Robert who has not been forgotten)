[Verse 1: milo]
I swear to goodness I have no fear of failure
A&E will always hold my place as a commercial wailer
Every mistake I've ever made has had an inexplicable beauty
You overachievers could never replace
I'm not sorry that I failed you
And I'll unabashedly crawl back under the rock that I hail to
I waste a lot of time perusing Wikipedia entries
Locating algorithms that'll make me famous like Fonzworth Bentley
I don't want to wear technicolor bowties
And I'm sure you could surmise
I'm not the type to ghost ride
I was the kid memorizing danger mouse in my tree house
A mansion is a place with plenty of couch space for all my friends
Real brothers don't care if you're an hour late to make amends

But nonetheless I am an hour late
Under a fig tree meditating on Schopenhauer's face
Ashy handed bandit bandwagon of one
What have I done [x2]

[Verse 2: milo]
This sadness is too real
I keep contorting my jawline like Blue Steel
Remember after class stealing muffins and it was nothing, we would laugh
My god, my God robbed Rob of his life force
Replaying the entire scene from my high horse
Passing blue bottles of Polo sport before our night course
Remember trips to Big Star in the back of Martin's beamer
Remember cigarillo burns and earnest eyed dreamers
Remember Kenosha public school politics
Remember Rob telling me to never apologize for shit
Remember learning to let our freak flag fly
We'd curse the sky
And say we'd never die and then you died
And I blame myself
And I blamed everybody that you'd ever met
Then channeled that into shitty rap songs for the internet
Then I smoked a corn cob pipe for a couple months
And felt my inner light grow dull like it never was
Now kids write me about being their favorite rapper
And I'm the asshole who gets to live forever after

[Bridge]
You don't want me to pull memories from way back cause you ain't got the necessary gigawatts in that maybach [x3]

Then I got these tattoos to prove that I too could last forever [x4]
I miss you

[Verse 3: milo]
The English language dictates we speak of you in past tense
Can you cross the River Styx with only a mere half pence?
I don't know the answers
I just know the dances
When your Facebook becomes your memorial page
And I swear to God I cry when I look through the pictorial display
