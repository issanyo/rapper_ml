[Interlude]
To all you marks

[Verse 1: milo]
No, no, I don't know this city well
Yeah, it's getting windy on this pedestal
I'm from the one black family in Rivendell
If I told you my old name, you couldn't pronounce it well
The ashy handed bandit with no scruples
A group full of us useful
Uncouth and too cool and always truthful
Yes it's him, with that uber Soto Zen flow
Read the Shobogenzo
Never? on tip toes and gems though?
That bookish basket case
Has a crooked bastard's face
I'm not smart or dumb
You glorify R. Crumb
Call sex hot lines in Parseltongue
You don't get embarrassed when you fart in public
I'm selling art in Dublin
To a young republican
Who suffers from impression that I'm under him

[Hook]
Gazing pass the moon
I think yesterday's sorrows
I will shut these mards up like Edward R. Murrow

[Sample]
So shut your blood clot and listen
Cause I'm bringing you the ill rendition
