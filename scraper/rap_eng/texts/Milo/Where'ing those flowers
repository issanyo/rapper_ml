Blackness

[Intro]
There's a music that that combines so many opposites
And once you find that balance
Then you have a guideline
You know, between freedom and discipline
Between rhythm and melody
Between uh, body and spirit
Between mind and instinct

[Verse 1: Elucid]
Avocado prices going up
You can always find the greens in aisle 1
Why come you act like we can't have nice things
Dirty digit over dirty money
Handshake suffice, I might
Reach for light, leading with my left
We all we got, connect
Sustain the block any and every Malcolm X
Make a word become flesh
(wearing those flowers)
Break the ground for soft baby's breath
So-called God blather about nation building ad nauseum
And never once mention black women
Fertile is a feeling, what a world that we mirror
Seeking to un-learn back to zero
My spirit body clad in Ruby Yacht apparel
Wrestle not in the flesh
Breaking atoms, outpacing my steps
I'm shedding shape and matter
(wearing those flowers that)
Rap money for flowers, buckwheat, and plant mill
Shadow hand skills, I'm just warming up
Rare feels, came as a wave

Nostrum, nostrum, nostrum
Grocers, grocers
[?], where'ing those flowers

[Verse 2: milo]
Flow art deco, ad nauseum
Sip prosecco, in the autumn
Howdy Mrs., I feel rowdy like Aloyisius
Pugilistic nephew, past curfew
Slurp me like tonkatsu
Recieve blessings like, "Atchoo!"
(Wearing those flowers)
Potluck lick, I'm Dr. Robotnik
My foot on their neck get monotonous
I like the culo gelatinous
Wrote this eating gelato with a goddess
You come across fluent with nonsense
Torturous ijarah, you can't barter with the owner-operator
Keep it (wearing those flowers) humming like a respirant, yeah
Jos√© Kozer with a unibrow
Hose a poser with a uni style
Keyser Soze with a goofy smile
It's two in the foul
Nostrum Grocers be like, "Owww"

[Outro]
That's the way it goes, though
Where'ing those flowers
That's the way it goes, that's the way it goes when you
Under the underground, when you under the underground
When you under the underground, when you under the underground
When you under the underground
(shout out to Dubuffet)
I was wearing those flowers
