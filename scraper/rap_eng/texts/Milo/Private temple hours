[Intro: milo]
Yeah little tricky bugger
Yeah yeah yeah

[Bridge: milo]
Veneration for derelicts accelerating through the doldrums
Gave you my whole self like, "My nigga, that's just my old one"
Fenestration of the giant yelling "ho hum ho hum"
Fenestration of the giant yelling "ho hum ho hum"

[Break: milo]
Two two yeah two two yeah, yeah, ayy

[Verse 1: milo]
I be in a pickled petticoat dropping books like Chuck Monsey
16 bar Rickrolling, beard of Mick Foley
Spit it, slick, coding in a Tennessee Ernie Ford tuxedo
Meat in the peep hole, overcaster of wonder
Open palms, spinning atop rotunda, uh

[Chorus: milo]
Private temple hours, private temple hours (uh huh uh)
My private temple hours yeah, in my private temple hours
It's my private temple hours, private temple hours
It's them private temple hours, private temple hours
It's uh private temple hours, private temple hours
Private temple hours
It's my private temple hours, private temple hours

[Verse 2: YOUNGMAN]
Private temple hours, private temple hours
Check out how I get live with mental powers
Yeah, check it!
Youngman in the building like an elevator
And whatever I don't rap well now, I'll tell ya later
Youngman in a wigwam like a straw roof
And when I lay down the law, it's the raw truth
Youngman in the house like a foyer
And when I punch Nazi goys they say, "Oy vey!" Enjoy hey
That the first time you got a face full of smarts
Both you and your nose are replaceable parts
White supremacy is the light Jew's frenemy
They'll hire you more often and still kill you eventually
Everything I say is incredibly great
While you steadily hate on anything you didn't make, fakes
I'm top five dead or alive
While wifi's your wife and you've lost all your drive
I'm top five dead, alive, or zombie while you stare
With dead eyes at a smartphone, you heart mo' than yo' mommy
I'm top five dead, alive or immortal while you're all worried about "Oh no is my storage full?"
Don't make eye contact now, it might stunt your growth
You've got a flat face and small mind, and I hunt for both
Youngman in the building like a steel girder
And when I kill with words it's real murder (Woo!)
