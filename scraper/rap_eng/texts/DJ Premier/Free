[Verse 1: Torii Wolf]
Its hard to tell you what I dont know
But I do know one thing better than you do
And its hard to tell you what to grow on
But I do know one thing better than you do

[Chorus]
We are free
We are free
We are free
We are free
It's important to me love
That you know we are free
It's important to me
That you know you are free

[Verse 2: Torii Wolf]
Its hard to give you what I dont have
But I might have something better for you
I tell you how to make that good thing last
And maybe make it all feel way better for you
Cause

[Chorus]
We are free
We are free
We are free
We are free
And it's important to me love
That you know we are free
It's important to me love
That you know we are free

[Verse 3: Macklemore]
Gotta have faith at all times
We all become an archive
Oh yea we all die, but
How do we spend our time
Like her with the false pride
Fuck word is at all time
Ego got the people
Divided minded and hog tied
Im a wake up in the morning
Prayin, doin yoga in that order
Keep my spirit open
So i can handle the fault lines
Cuz the earth be shake'n yall
Free, I ain't listening
What they hate'n on
You gotta step into the ring with satan dog
My sparing partner is the devil
But I train with god
Legend hay-makers and I can't play the wall
Bare knuckles in these glove
Gotta take em off
You knuckle up, or run from what you struggle from
It's just another day, under the sun
Baby im livin on
Free, (Free)
Sixteen, dreamteam, me and Preem
Breakbeats, greentea and uh
Free, (Free)
Half peace, half beat
And as long as im me
Then you know that im
Free, (free)
Free, (free)

[Outro: Torii Wolf]
Cause it's important to me love
That you know we are free

[Premier Scratching]
Freedom is a road
Seldom traveled by the multitude

Free, Free
