[Hook]
We out here in the streets tryna make some profits
Dope boys got it and sell it to those who want it
And if you ever cheat on your fly chick
Just know there's always somebody watching

[Verse 1]
Ayo, I spit it from the heart, me and wack rappers stay apart
I ride for the brothers all day from morning till the dark
Everyone wants bread, they're racing like Mario Kart
If there's a pothole, we restart; the grind will never fall apart
I've been killing it from the start, now's the time that I make my mark
Black hoodies in the dark, got Supreme Dreams like Mark
To get green like the wild, people being done foul
I've been crawling for the crown, you've been copying rappers' style
And it's so wild, all of the doubters: look at me now
While your head was in the clouds, I've been plotting on my way out
At one point I lost inspiration, but that's gone; I'm celebrating
The lengths I'm taking for creating this fiery sensation
And you wonder why you got no talent, meanwhile I've been got it
That's cause you talk about yoppas but you tote wrist rockets
Oh so many traps, there's a lot of cappers in rap
And once someone snatches your bag, yo, there's no having it back
Wraps

[Hook]
We out here in the streets tryna make some profits
Dope boys got it and sell it to those who want it
And if you ever cheat on your fly chick
Just know there's always somebody watching

[Verse 2]
I can't trust most, that's why I don't confide in them
You must be smoking something like Eric, Kelso and Hyde and them
If you think that I have no talent, when I've been writing them
Untouchable bars, and I don't mean from Revival
I had thought about it and it don't matter if I'm the greatest
All that matters is that there are lives that I'll be changing
On the daily, killing these rap niggas like I am racist
Never needed anyone, my own is what I stay in
"Ayo, you K RACK$? Cause, bro, you the truth"
But all you said was lies when I tried to be friends with you
ODs almost got Ye and Lex, it took Mac Miller
All these signs from God say we need to stop pushing pills, bruh
That's to the rappers, that's why the media clowning us
And I ain't tryna talk down to ya
I just don't want no one to be like six feet underground from us
Cause these past years have took pioneers of the sound from us
This Bridgeport life is not worth it
I understand we got flaws, we not perfect
But some these girls cockthirsty, get shot while opps lurking
Brothers scraping brothers, killing all up on the block, dirty
And meanwhile, I'm out searching
For a way to get rich while not getting caught murdered
Like the lightskin who got shot by hot burners
Up in that verse written by Kendrick Lamar; Oh, and
I always say to myself, these chances, do not blow 'em
Cause these chances the only thing that I got going
I doubt that I'ma get clout and blowing while I'm out here flowing
It seems my only chance is school or to die homeless

[Bridge]
I'm on the come up and you will never stop it
I work for my bread, you silly niggas just rob it
Freestyles off the top, kid
I'm telling you the truth but never call me a prophet

[Hook]
We out here in the streets tryna make some profits
Dope boys got it and sell it to those who want it
And if you ever cheat on your fly chick
Just know there's always somebody watching
