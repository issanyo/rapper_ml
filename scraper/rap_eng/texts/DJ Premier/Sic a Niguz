[Big Shug]
Yeah, I'm sick of this bullshit
Fake-ass niggas and shit, y'knahmean?
One, yeah
Get it right man f'real, stop whinin and shit
Shut your punk ass up f'real
I'm sick of your punk ass

I'm sick of niggas, who claim to be the best
Say they sleep with the vest but won't come fi test
I'm sick of niggas, who wanna front on Cribs
But won't invite Shug over for the beef ribs
I'm sick of niggas, who say they street like me
I see by your profile you deeply sweet
I'm sick of niggas, who like to talk to cops
And scared to death to box, and suck on cocks
I'm sick of niggas, who rhyme in the same clique
You sound like your man and he's, dog shit
I'm sick of niggas, who fell the fuck off
It's over now nigga, get the fuck off
I'm sick of niggas, who claim to be the boss
But spend their money, on pedicures and lip gloss
I'm sick of niggas, who ask me for money
I slap the dog shit out you sonny, I'm sick

[Hook: repeat 2X]
Wit'cha fake-ass gangsta shit, I'm sick of niggas
In they trick clothes tryin to pimp, I'm sick of niggas
In the hood now chillin with rats, I'm sick of niggas
I'm sick sick, sick sick sick, sick of niggas

[Freddie Foxxx a.k.a. Bumpy Knuckles]
Listen, it's Bumpy Knuckles niggas bow, salute the royal higness
I'm the finest and divine of all rhymers, since the 90's
Hardcore niggas I'm back, sick at you niggas
Still got that ol', fo', fifth at you niggas
I'm sick of you niggas who get, but don't help get
Other niggas bread blockin they shit
I'm sick of niggas and this earring shit, both ears hangin
Like granny in the large house sangin
Sick of niggas who fake gangbangin, set-claimin and crack slangin
But got they NexTel police phone rangin
I'm sick of white boys who got soul
Still on this mic, cause I'm still not cold, y'all not fuckin with me
I'm sick of niggas with they fancy cars
You spittin bullshit, step up your bars
Sick of rap suckers, I got SARS - get it? SARS
Sick of havin to always explain my bars

[Outro - repeat 2X]
I'm sick of niggas, who want a deal
I'm sick of niggas, who I cannot feel
I'm sick of niggas, who snitch and squeal
I'm sick, I'm sick, I'm sick
