[Intro]
Hey KRS ONE do yo thing man

[KRS-ONE]
This going out to the hardcore hip hop

[N0va]
That hardcore shit

[KRS-ONE]
This going out to the hardcore hip hop
Of course we don't flip flop

[Verse 1: N0va]
Alright, Check
Suburban boy drinking burboun out the bottle
Its only Wednesday night but I take it full throttle
I only chase drinks with bong hits
I only chase chicks with thick hips and bomb lips
Naw fuck that I only chase dreams that meek miss
Always chasing something – tryna make it pop like a weak cyst
I’m always oozing something sick
Control the cruise bumping Kanye while I bump a fist
You know what to do ? motherfucker just cut yo wrists
Or I can do it, I could put it on my bucket list
I ain't in my zone yet
Shackle made of stones but
But Im cookin up a potion that’ll put me in the throne
Spitting out some poison – like some venom out my dome
I’m itching for a chance to kick the king out of his home
I can feel it in my bones I been jonzeing to rap
Addicted to the flow – that you know it’s a fact
Everybody wanna smoke, I can roll in the back
I'm colder than the North pole with no Coat and No hat
Ha! That's a lame bar, don't hold up like a weak limb
Like Yokozuna doing pullups at a Cheap Gym
Ha Ha!
It all gunna crash and fall a ton
Like 7 days straight binging on Adderall and rhum
Do people understand nova?
I’d betray anyone for eggs benedict on a hangover
But I would Never fuck my fans over

[Hook]
MC's act like they don't know
(So Ima tell em ! uh!)
MC's act like they don't know
(So Ima tell em bruh)
(You betcha ass ima tell bruh)
MC's act like they don't know

[Verse 2: N0va]
I was never raised a crook but everyone change
I done broke bad, broke glass and broke through the chains
Making a murder – without Netflix clearing my name
I Lost all my homies over the pettiest thangs
Too many stoners getting caught and arraigned up in the system
The government needs prisoners cuz it benefits em
Capitalism – the money moves in a rhythm
I could spit all the wisdom But y'all dudes never listen
We’re growing up scared – not in touch with the times
You couldn’t shield a child from the medias lies
The same things I used to Fear now I look straight in the eye
Cuz I’m all grown up its like I’m 80 in mind
I’m from the dot – where the kings won't share a piece of the dinner
They let the rest of us starve - cuz they ego is bigger
That 1 percent stay hot , while the rest of us shiver
But we always find a way to spark a spliff in the winter
Cuz the six never sleep We hotboxin the rental
Flick the blunt out the window while I’m gassin the pedal
My downtown dawgs going loose in the kennel
All these pussy ass rappers too shook for my level

[Hook]
MC's act like they don't know
(So Ima tell em ! uh!)
MC's act like they don't know
(So Ima tell em bruh)
(You betcha ass ima tell bruh)
MC's act like they don't know

[Verse 3: N0va]
Check, listen
Ive become mentally unstable
Thinking bout the game and put my cards on the table
Just wondering if I’m able To cut the boy from the man
So I can stop letting distractions toy with my plan
Im quick to be making excuses
I’m sick of just feeling im useless
The only time I feel real is when Im spitting and making my music
This my solution now I sleep better at night
Knowing I’m grinding for ma dreams we can set up a fight
Now its Me against the world now and I’m betting my life
That Ima jump all the hurdles and set a record despite
The obstacles
And all the hands ive been dealt
Got me feeling things a man never felt
Let my fears just hang from a belt
I care too much to give up on it
Leaves me restless and stressed – when im lit on chronic
I get high as a way to to leave my woes behind
Running through the 6, Im just rapping and hoping to open minds
I lived a life that you can't replicate
Coming from a place where talking shit will give yo neck a brace
It's N0va
