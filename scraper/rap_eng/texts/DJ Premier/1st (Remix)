[Intro: Torii Wolf]
I got my high eyes on you with my feet on the ground
Won't you dance with me, baby, dance

[Sample]
Dilated

[Verse 1: Rakaa Iriscience]
Three words, she said 'em first
Said it's real till it hurts, offered a doctor and nurse
She said, "I love you for death", I said, "I pay for the hearse"
Ice pumped through my veins and the script was reversed
I revealed I was willin', cold shoulder was chillin'
Tripped onto emotion, it felt hard but I'm healin'
Dealin' with these flashbacks and I'm numb with no feelin'
4 weelin' in this old school whip with no ceiling
Crazy I'm gone

[Verse 2: Evidence (Rakaa Iriscience)]
I get over this shit, you know what happens then (Ha)
I stop giving a fuck, they want be back again
Departed to departed
Fought to the end right back where we started
To the one square, it takes two to make one pair
Leaving me when I believe it is unfair (Yup)
Ain't no love lost (Nah), but ain't no love there (Uh)
I turn around and walk away, cause I don't run scared

[Sample]
I've seen the last come first
I've seen the first last

[Chorus: Torii Wolf]
You fell in love with me first, oh
We fell in love

[Sample]
I've seen the last come first
I've seen the first last

You fell in love with me first, oh
So why are you running away, away
Why are you running away, away, away?

[Verse 3: Torii Wolf]
I got my high eyes on you with my feet on ground
Won't you dance with me, baby, dance
I got my high eyes on you with my feet on ground
Won't you dance with me, baby, dance?

[Sample]
I've seen the last come first
I've seen the first last

[Verse 4: Rakaa Iriscience (Evidence)]
I've seen it first-hand
(I've seen the worst, damn)
Tryna fast forward on the planet spinning backwards
Where darkness is the light
(Where crying is the laughter)
Where living isn't vital
(Where death isn't promised)
Where temporary's final
(Where truth isn't honest
Tryna finish this shit, I wish I never started)
Where life is soft clay
Where lessons are the hardest

[Chorus: Torii Wolf]
You fell in love with me first, oh!

[Sample]
I've seen the last come first
I've seen the first last

You fell in love with me first, oh
And I fell in love with you
And I fell in love with you
So why are you running away, away
Why are you running away, aha
Why are you running away from me?

[Sample]
I've seen the last come first
I've seen the first last
