[Verse]
Got these flowers on the floor
And it's not where they belong
No, it's not where they belong, babe
Walking after dark
Go back to where we were
I try and find you like before

[Chorus]
And, no, you're not where you belong
And I hope it's not too long
Before you're back inside my arms again
Just like these flowers on the floor
You're much farther than you were before
Yes, I loved you all along
[?]
Long before I found you here
And, no

[Chorus]
And, no, you're not where you belong
And I hope it's not too long
Before you're back inside my arms
And, no, you're not where you belong
And I hope it's not too long
Before you're back inside my arms

[Post-Chorus]
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

No, we're not where we belong
No, we're not where we belong
Deep inside our hearts
