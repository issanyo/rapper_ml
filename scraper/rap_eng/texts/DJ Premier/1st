[Sample]
I’ve seen the last come first
I’ve seen the first, last
I’ve seen the last come first
I’ve seen the first, last
I’ve seen the last come first
I’ve seen the first, last

[Verse 1]
I got my high eyes on you with my feet on ground
Won't you dance with me, baby, dance
I got my high eyes on you with my feet on ground
Won't you dance with me, baby, dance?

[Sample]
I’ve seen the last come first
I’ve seen the first, last

[Chorus]
You fell in love with me first, oh
You fell in love

[Sample]
I’ve seen the last come first
I’ve seen the first, last

You fell in love with me first, oh
So why are you running away, away
Why are you running away, away, away?

[Sample]
I’ve seen the last come first
I’ve seen the first, last

[Verse 2]
Darling, tell me what would it take
What does it take to keep you from running away, oh
And I got my high mind on you with my hands on it now
Won't you dance with me, baby, dance
I got my high mind on you with my hands on it now
Won't you dance for me, baby, dance?

[Sample]
I’ve seen the last come first
I’ve seen the first, last

[Chorus]
You fell in love with me first, oh
We fell in love
You fell in love with me first, oh
So why are you running away, away
Why are you running away, away, away?

[Sample]
I’ve seen the last come first
I’ve seen the first, last

You fell in love with me first, oh!

[Sample]
I’ve seen the last come first
I’ve seen the first, last

You fell in love with me first, oh
And I fell in love with you
And I fell in love with you
I fell in love with you
And I fell in love with you
So why are you running away, away
Why are you running away, aha
Why are you running away from me?

[Sample]
I’ve seen the last come first
I’ve seen the first, last
