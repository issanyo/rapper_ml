[Intro]
Sunkiss on the mic. You got DJ Premier on the track and this is how we do it. In the Benz or the 'Lac we both macks

[Hook] (DJ Premier) {x2}
Sunkiss on the mic, DJ Premier on the track
(Yo, that's my man we go back)
Like big boombox's, Adidas shell top
Electric boogie, the wiggle or the wop
The fitted Levis and we still real
And this true hip hop, the culture we feel

[Verse One]
Used to be in jail every summer every winter
I was a bad boy, a crook, a sinner
Always fighting and cursing old ladies
Rolling through The Bronx in a stolen Mercedes
I used to sell drugs, anything you need
Weed, Ecstasy yes indeed
The devil had so much control of my soul
I prayed to God so much my jeans had holes
I used to start fist fights for no apparent reason
As long as I was leaving the other person bleeding
It didn't matter who, I even fought the cops
But they would only win cause they'd pile on top
But yo
Then I met DJ Premier
He had something I wanted to hear
He had the beats with the scratches and cuts
And he made the girls move they butts so what

[Hook]

[Verse Two]
Ladies over here with the sexy ass lips
Fellas over here with the Vodka they sip
Chilling with the ice grill, thugs don't dance
Shorty want the rough sex no romance
Grab that hair, smack that booty
Scratch my neck, my back, give it to me
Raised in the ghetto, I learned to make it rough
We take all we can but never take enough
I know a girl named Big Booty Jobeena
Brothers used to call her The Human Vacuum Cleaner
The way she'd make you feel on a warm summer evening
Make you wanna cry when she said she was leaving
Then she met DJ Premier
He had something she wanted to hear
He had the bass with the scratches and the cuts
And he made the girl move her butt so what

[Hook]
