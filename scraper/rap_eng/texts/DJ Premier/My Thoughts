[Verse 1]
Same niggas that rocked with Bump from the giddiyup
Same niggas who helped to tear New York City up
Yeah, I'm pretty witty with it
Zab Judah pretty with it
You win some you lose, some still fucking gritty with it
Mouth is a chick's favorite, they wanna put a titty in it
I was a bad boy, dawg, way before Diddy did it
Ever had a bid he did it, if Buffy wants a baby with a boss
Tell that big butt bitch to come get it, I'm with it
Hot verse I spit it, chronicles like Riddick
I could have fucked your girl, dawg, she was on my didick
New red yankee fitted, fresh blunt nail split it
Lay it in, roll it up, lick it one time, hit it
Shit y'all niggas beefing 'bout, I ain't really down with it
Half of ya niggas switch hittes anyway, admit it
Keep a rach 2 cliddips, I ain't tryna blow you up
I'm a guarantee FedEx shot, dawg,you will get it

[Hook]
My thoughts, these are my thoughts
These are my thoughts
These are my thoughts

[Verse 2]
Y'all salute the OG, know that I'm a boss, dawg
Got paper call shots in my time like I'm boss hogg
Plus I got the Rosco P Co
Sixten shots to your melon pieace, duke you're finito
Tried to do it legal, paper didn't add up equal
To the work I was doing for white people
Sorry for the shout out, don't mean to be deceitful
Crackers got this game locked better than we do
Sacrifice their young to get the legal tender
First time offender, now they understand us
You riding with the black boys now,, dawg, stand up
Turn your microphone and your band up and man up
Now we put that work in, knew from a fetus they would need us
But we in a jail cell where they keep us
And hardly feed us
When niggas either ride with the Bloods, Muslims or call on Jesus

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Bring the guns and the goons, black
Primo and the boom bap
The 48 hot fucking bars to bring your room back
Dawg, you're a opener, Bumpy, I'm a closer
I spit like I'm high of kush when I be sober
And when my show is over I growl for the cameras
Cause I know I'mma collect my money with a hammer
So y'all be into glamor and I be into duckings
Your gun is for show, mines is to buck it, so
Fuck it, run your mouth and catch it like the common cold
I snatch gold and fatten up the bank roll
I put my niggas right to work when they make parole
My niggas eat before their freedom, it's a day old
We set up on your block and divi the bank roll
Or pull them ezpass blasters, you pay tolls
Connects they blaming you, so you gotta pay it
Respect the game and the rules and how we play it
Say it

[Hook]
