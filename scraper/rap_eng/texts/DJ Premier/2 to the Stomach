[Intro]
What? Yeah, my nigga Preem man
Came, got me off these muthafuckin' streets yo
Was out there doing my muthafuckin' thing
It's a wrap for y'all niggas now, ya heard?
FUBAR, yeah, y'all go hoo-ha!

[Verse 1]
Oh my god, y'all niggas didn't want none of me
Preemo, you should've let me chill, leave me be
But now I gotta attack, pull out my rap stacks
Show all these bitch-ass niggas they can get backslapped
Queensbridge, that's my motherfuckin' kingdom
Poet's my name son and that's where I came from
I been a motherfuckin' terror ever since day one
I was toting Glocks, niggas was playing with play guns
Everything is motherfuckin' real I say dunn
Get out my way dunn, I'm 'bout to slay dunn
Beat you like a slave dunn, make you obey dunn
Poet don't play dunn, the outcome? Critical, crucial
The shit I'ma do to you make hell seem beautiful
I murdered this shit intro to outro
I got real dogs that eat Alpo, straight take you out yo
Show you what this gangsta shit be all about yo

[Hook]
Poet's coming, click boom, 2 to the stomach
I give it to whoever want it
Poet's coming, click boom, 2 to your stomach
I give it to whoever want it, the thug poet
Poet's coming, click boom, 2 to the stomach
I give it to whoever want it, what?
Poet's coming, click boom, 2 to your stomach
I give it to whoever want it, the thug poet

[Verse 2]
Poet's coming hardcore
With a new style for the art of war
Let the Hennessy flow, let my enemies know
Niggas is dead if they not kin of me or friend of me yo
You're not ready for the raw deal, it's all real
Tryna penetrate my force field, get all killed
You don't want to see the Mac clip all the way filled
Big nurse the motherfuckin' gat all in your grill
My shit is banned from TV, banned from radio
You gotta cop me on the low like a bag of dro
I represent the street, I represent niggas hungry
And they wanna eat that gangsta shit
Guns out, blunts lit, polyin' over the strip
Renegades, crack-slingin' soldiers
Hustlers locked down for moving real boulders
Thug bitches that don't play the kitchen, they play the street
'Cause fuck that, hoes gotta eat
Poet's comin'

[Scratched]
A thug poet
Think I'm playin'?

Hit 'em with that shit Preem

[Hook]
Poet's coming, click boom, 2 to your stomach
I give it to whoever want it, what?
Poet's coming, click boom, 2 to your stomach
I give it to whoever want it, the thug poet
Poet's coming, click boom, 2 to your stomach
I give it to whoever want it, what?
Poet's coming, click boom, 2 to your stomach
I give it to whoever want it, the thug poet

[Verse 3]
It's a lot of niggas comin' in, a lot of niggas comin' off
A lot of niggas frontin' like they ill when they butter soft
Competition looks thick, got a lot of niggas locked
But they ain't like me, I'm like you, I'm like from your block
Shot G's with gym stars, dump D's in marked cars
Stay a real nigga in the street and behind bars
Fuck the radio play, I don't need it anyway
Remember back in the day in L.A., N.W.A?
That's the type of shit that I'm on
Gotta get my motherfuckin' shine on
Murderin' every beat I rhyme on
Niggas light up with me, bitches get drunk with me
No rapper and no company can fuck with me, see?
Straight like that, I got that king cobra venomous rap
Get in my face and I'ma give you a smack
I'm on some what what, Noreaga shit
Pull out, spray this bitch
Blaq Poet: hip hop's most dangerous

[Hook]
Coming, click boom, 2 to the stomach
I give it to whoever want it, what?
Poet's coming, click boom, 2 to your stomach
I give it to whoever want it, the thug poet
Poet's coming, click boom, 2 to your stomach
I give it to whoever want it, what?
Poet's coming, click boom, 2 to your stomach
I give it to whoever want it, the thug poet

[Outro]
Shit happens any minute, ya heard?
QB, QB's muthafuckin' finest
Get outta here Preem man, fuck the bitch-ass niggas
