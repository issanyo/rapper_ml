[Intro]
Yeah, it's the god Rakim
Word up, I'm blazin this out to all my comrades
Yanamean? From the slums of New York, to the gutters all over the world
This is for y'all....

[Verse 1]
Through my travels I try to take righteous steps
Because right or left could mean life or death
No matter how trife it get, my sights is set
But it's twice the threat when the nights is death
My mental windows refuse to close, they get exposed
To the neighborhood info where the poison wind blows
A deadly plague spreadin' negativity, viciously
Unto every city be in ghetto misery
Don't let it get to me, the writer be left to die
But it get mesmerize if it catch your eye
Shines enormous, from pure revered Kool's and garments
But it's torment, jealousy drug wars or warring
Tallying, slowly turnin' into barbarians
More scary when the whole boulevard's carryin'
Livin' in the world of sin, my ghetto girls and men
Waiting for the world to end

[Hook]
"Tryin to paint a perfect picture and excel"
"In case you didn't know"
"Never movin' backwards"
"Complicated"
"Know what I mean?"

[Verse 2]
I see destruction, even little kids trust none
They bust guns, that's what they get a rush from
When I see 'em, we build and have a real discussion
"Yo Ra, what's the jewel of the day?" "What up, son"
"You got ambition?" Shorty said, "Man listen
"I got demands for livin, can't stand division
"Make grands on my mission, 'til everything glisten
"Women in the Expedition, no plans for prison
"In a vision the city get, 2 milleni G
"Sittin' in my embassy, sippin' Hennesy
"Gettin' high, and watch life pass me by"
So I asked him why, with a fast reply
He said "I'm livin just to die without any feelings
So I wait here for my maker till it's time to go
With this dime I know, with all of her girls and all of my men
Waiting for the world to end"

[Hook]
"Tryin to paint a perfect picture and excel"
"In case you didn't know"
"Never movin' backwards"
"Complicated"
"Know what I mean?"

[Verse 3]
Shorty was taught to keep his head to the sky, and never cry
But the streets left him to die, now it's death in his eye
Livin' a sin of hitmen, a sinister grin
From the beginning to end, in it to win
Evil rebels, doin' what we doin' in the ghetto
Thinkin' if we was thorough we can deceive the devil
You can't win, your life be end, try again
Shorty said, "Why we born again to die again?"
That's what I said when I realized I had a gift
To uplift and be one of Allah's advocates
Teach the youth and speak the truth
Show 'em what peace can do when they'll reach for you
And my reward won't be jewels or cheese, it's even better
I can be one of the greatest MC's ever
If I tell 'em they intelligent women and great men
And live, stop waitin' for the world to end

[Hook]
"Tryin to paint a perfect picture and excel"
"In case you didn't know"
"Never movin' backwards"
"Complicated"
"Know what I mean?"
"I'm ragin, rippin up the stage an'
Don't it sound amazin, know what I mean?"
"Don't it sound amazin, know what I mean?"
"Rakim"
