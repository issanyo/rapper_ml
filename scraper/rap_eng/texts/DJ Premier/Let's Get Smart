[Intro]
The Works of Mart
“Plus I’m very smart”
It’s different
Just different

[Hook]
Yes, this is Saigon, yes it’s Mart
They done dumbed it down, now let’s get smart
They done dumbed it down, now let’s get smart
Let’s get smart “plus I’m very smart”

[Verse 1]
Nah Preem, I ain’t come around to dumb It down
I done started a revolution, I ain’t running now
‘Cause I don’t yab about having fun, I’m underground?
‘Cause the industry couldn’t get me to become a clown
Mel said don’t push him ‘cause he’s close to the edge
The one to fail shit, most of them dead
It’s ironic if have some bread to put some toast to your head
You just wanted to go to bed, you wanted a wanted poster instead
Trying to be something you’re not got you fronting a lot
Stop using hip-hop to corrupt the block
This nigga preaching the life that he doesn’t live
That ain’t the fact of the matter, look what it does to the kids
Make them want to grow up to be drug dealers
Leading them down a dead end, you’s a fuck nigga
If I can bring Pac back and send y’all to wherever he’s at
Guess what, black people, we back

[Hook]
Yes, this is Saigon, this is Mart
They done dumbed it down, now let’s get smart
They done dumbed it down, now let’s get smart
Let’s get smart, let’s get smart
It’s bigger than business, this is art
We done dumbed it down, now let’s get smart
We done dumbed it down, now let’s get smart
Let’s get smart “plus I’m very smart”

[Verse 2]
Whoever own Worldstar’s a motherfucking genius
‘Cause he ain’t paying for that content
Niggas grab cameras and record all this nonsense
Sending it to them and they get rich from advertisements and sponsors
All you get is a fucked up conscience
Of being a part of depicting your people as some kind of monsters
I’m from the true religion of Clark Kents
Big as just living as hip-hop since it was still on the park bench
That’s why my bars strong as cigar stench
Deadly like Agent Orange, or AIDS, arsenic
Can’t defend myself ‘cause I’m always on offense
The two don’t give you a clue, the nine will give y’all hints
This Saigon and Premier up in here (yeah, yeah)
And we’re giving them think rap this year (yeah, yeah)
Selling it to them shrink rap this here
Hottest shit in the streets, this is heat right here

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Preem, they tried to turn the art form to popcorn
Long as we still rocking, that is not for long
I dwelled here twelve year, that’s ‘cause I belong
You drop a couple hot songs then your rocks is gone
How many niggas can call themselves what I did?
How many brothers done suffered as much as I did?
You see the pain whenever I lift my eyelid
That’s why I’m not in the category as Talib
I give you the greatest story ‘cause that’s what I lived
When I say it’s pain in my life, that’s what I had
Alright, so what, I have money now, why should I brag?
In the hood, they still can’t afford iPads
Who you know just goes and switch flows
Like this, this the show, I have lyrics to go, you know
It’s one thing when you’re just having fun with it
Y’all taking that dumb shit and running with it

[Hook]

[Outro]
“Plus I’m very smart”
“Plus I’m very smart”
“Plus I’m very smart”
“Plus I’m very smart”
