[Verse 1: AKDotZ}
Now I'm just looking at my generation
So much talents in many places,seeing a lot of new faces
Meeting a lot of new races, but I am not trying to be racist...
..When I say
That black people run the rap game, and
It's true
They got bars for days, but I do too
But it's so hypocritical like people who say "suwop" but wear blue
Now I'm just doing my thing til' I die
I won't finish last cuz' I'm not a nice guy
Well, not anymore
I won't stop working til' my words are in stores
And people just cop it
Then watch it swish like I'm ballin'
Get the money and travel around the world and see Holland
Holland, and definitely Egypt
But guess what
I'm not even Egyptian
But getting a spot int he rap game is my mission
I'm trying to get in control but I'm not dissing
Cuz' if I did I'd be wrapped up like an Egyptian

[Chorus: AKdotZ]
Say Uh, UH that egyptian shit, you bitch niggas better just get wit it
Say uh, uh that egyptian shit, if you hatin' I ain't trippin bitch!
Say uh,uh that egyptian shit. That egyptian shit

Verse 2: AKdotZ
They told me my shit is not normal
I be walking 'round dressed like I'm formal
And if you can't see it, then you need some bifocals
I'm doin it for the locals, the people I stick with
My bars are startin' to sizzle kinda like a skillet
Trying to make my style unorthodox, but they said I first needa smoke the pot
But I'm tryna be a Top Dawg like Jay Rock
I'm a funny guy like Chris, but everybody hates em'
But I'm kinda dangerous like a Haitian
Watch this earth shake, but do it like Iverson, behind the back then I pump fake
Now I got you jumpin'
I do this shit all day it ain't nothin'
I do this on the regula, you can't hate ain't nobody stoppin' ya
Too smart for Harvard, not tryna get an Oscar
You fake like Impostors
No wait, more like mannequins
Shoot him and notice that damn that's yo man again
They see me rollin', they ain't tryna stop him
They expect me to do good things and I got em'
Some people hating damn I forgot em'
Damn they in the past so they really isn't nothin'
People see him and they just hug em'
Well that's because.... (EVERYBODY LOVE EM')

Chorus:
