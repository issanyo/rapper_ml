[Intro]
But in the present, I will remain
Because time and space, is all a game
You play to win, and then you make your name

[Verse]
I'm trying to be good, babe
I'm tired of [?]
You asked me just to wait right here
I'm trying to be pure, babe
I'm trying to just keep warm
But I just can't wait this long

[Chorus]
What I gotta beg for your love
Your love, your love
It's not what I'm meant to do, here no
What I gotta beg for your love
Your love, your love
It's not what I'm meant to do, here no

But in the present, I will remain
Because time and space, is all a game
You play to win, and then you make your name

[Verse 2]
I'm trying to be good, babe
I'm tired of [?]
You asked me just to wait right here
I'm trying to be pure, babe
I'm trying to just keep high
But I just can't wait this long

[Chorus]
Why I gotta beg for your love
Your love, your love
It's not what I'm meant to do, here no
Why I gotta beg for your love
Your love, your love
It's not what I'm meant to do, here no

But in the present, I will remain
Because time and space, is all a game
You play to win, and then you make your name
But in the present, I will remain
Because time and space, is all a game
You play to win, and then you make your name
