Demigod Scoundrel and my name is AP

[Verse 1: Apathy]
Last year, my record company was jumpin' me
I wrote "Fuck You" to show they couldn't fuck with me
And I never got dropped but I needed to do something quick
So I'm packin' up my bags and I'm jumpin' ship
I write rhymes like a pimp, always getting my dick licked
Bitches sweat my notebook more than that chick flick
I'm nice with the rhymes but I'm nicer with the ladies
Leaving boxers on the floor like Tyson in the 80s
I'm a D-E-M-I-G-O-D
Add a Z on the end 'cause I brought my friends
I'm known to fist fight quick and rock bright white kicks
Steal the show from bigger acts with the white stripe shit
I'm an arrogant fuck that keeps tearin' it up
My dicks so big ya chick think I'm wearin' a cup
I never ever rock Bapes people think they so hot
Nikes are transformers, Bathing Apes are Go-Bots
But back to the label shit, they not doing nothing
And I'm sick of tellin' fans I don't know when it's coming
They just put out Lupe, they sleeping on Saigon
Barely gave Little Brother love fuck it I'm gone

"Style's beyond sick can't fuck with the clique"

[Verse 2: Ryu]
No you can't hid from the Godz, I expose all frauds
The cops won't find the body 'til the snows all thawed
So bozo pause, you're fuckin' with a stone-cold squad
That'll start up a revolution for a so-so cause
I'm loco, y'all, retarded, if you want it it's cool
Anonymous type, I'll let piranhas loose in ya pool
I'm PCP from CT to CPT
My crew's still number one like it's BDP
You see these geeks
You're frontin' every second, you know it
Your records are ho-ish
You wanna get respect? Well then show it
I'm an exceptional poet, you better look where you're going
And hide the rifle 'cause I'm liable to go mental and blow it
Schizophrenic with rhyme, plus I'm ahead of my time
Make the chicks say "styles" and the brothers say "ho"
You can't tell a motherfucker what to do when he's drunk
You wanna act like a punk, then I'll react with a pump
It's the end of the time so I got to get mine
Hey yo Ap' what's the plan, hit me up when you land
I got some business to finish, the God fixin' to get it
My man E's gonna load a 16 and spit it

[Verse 3: Emilio Lopez]
With a Eagle from the Desert I bust a bumba clot
While I be puffin' pot, your girl be suckin' cock
Ap' made drop with the mixtape done
And I'm still poppin' tags by the way of the slum
There hasn't been a 'Rican like me since the days of the Pun
Sorry for the delay, blame the haze in my lungs
You know the situation with the Demigod foundation
We stay dough rakin', sorta sound ground breakin'
Spreadin' Cali love with the Styles of Beyond
I'm hot like I live a couple miles from the sun
Fuck a racist, we order bottles of the Don
And fuck a local bitch, I'm hittin' models on my lawn
The flow crazy, I hate it when a ho lazy
I ain't a nurse but I'll teach you how to hold babies
Only deuce-deuce, feeling like I'm old lately
'Cause the money flows slower than a old lady
And I'm used to living faster than Jeff Gordon
Hittin' tellys up with two bitches exploring
Crew love, if I'm rich, the set ballin'
You fucks 'bout to go extinct like cassette Walkmans
