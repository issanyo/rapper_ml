Apex be dat lyrical prohphet, so stop it wid nonsense, Bhudda knows I ain't rapping for the profit, never played sports why you jocking, in the skys like a prophet, spit flame so you know I'm carrot topping

Please don't try and top top it, viscous when I dish it comes wid more than 3 toppings, best served cold like the water from a faucet, we bossin, bedrock beats cuz they tell me that they love the way I rock it

Crumbs of your career stuck between my k9's, Ring bells like chymes when my name comes to mind, nevermind how I buy, just worry bout the grind, in time, overseas rapping bout my state of mind

State of mind is the message, never intercept it, mind is always present, bless him for my blessings, blessing is my presence and presence is a virtue, crafting worded weapons with a burn that might hurt you

I, Got you shook, slave to page in my book word to nas we some muthafucking gods, had to do it for the streets cuz its where rap beats, rap beats get beaten lyrics will mistreat em

Rappers I be eating, need a daily dosage, other niggas acting vegan, moving scoliosis codeine when I'm leaning, the green is misleading, you be spending cheese while I'm spiritually healing

Physically feeling your le main squeeze, now she nearing testies, I don't even wanna beat it, got producers fiending, say they want want the rhymes, I say all in due time, cuz I kill for no reason

Treason this season, guiding young cats from the signs of the beacon, flows been morphed in the garden of eden, causing depletion results in deletion, tectonics touch now the world is uneven

So what you gonna do? Call me majin buu with a little mewtwo, visualising rhymes just some thought for the food, well food for you thought, let the message haunt you

Check it

Yo we astro travelling, 6 feet deep gravellin, no craig higgins, we crate diggins the flows unravelling, you wonder what's happening, gambling with your hearts, cuz see as the plot thickens you get left up in the dark

Ain't got no tissues for your issues, jus word powerd missules and be sure there sure to hit you, from rap they will dismiss you, kiss you, hit you with a fist full of pistols, The hit go BOW!  Grave shift now they miss you

Reverend knew, I am que with the juice, its the truth, in the chamber than I shoot the moon, with a flute in my shoes to awaken kamoon, ghoul in the pool chase the fool round the tomb, Till noon oooh
