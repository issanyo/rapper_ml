Introduction:

"Fuck who that I offend. Rappers sit back
I'm bout to begin" - Big L

[Verse One]

Don't get me started on this massacre
See my dialogue's reflecting a higher caliber
Make examples of amateurs
I damage you
With the wordplay
Sending seven shots to your vertebrae
On a Sunday
In the night time
From the skyline
During prime time, listen
How many devils have to die before they see me
Watching my solar rays send holograms
In the form of those that can be
My infinite complexities in the night time
And in my mind
I'll send a death wish to your timeline
That's death without the physical
Spiritual mathematical
My calculations aren't compatible to the new age
My destiny's a manifested excellence
The 90s had the Wu-Tang
But from here on it's the movement
Try to act like we ain't got this
Find your body parts in the boxes
Take me back to Africa
With an AK and a full clip
And I'll resurrect the mother lands
With the words that I spit
Listen my systematic alchemy
Shoot the king up and your majesty
Put a lock up on your third eye
Make you think you seeing props
Ayo top of the morning
The god's flow is hardly retarded
See I was deaf to the barking
Of these shitty rappers
Saying I'm garbage
You was hardly regarded for the record
I was winning regardless
And for the record
Disloyal ass niggas get to steppin!

[Chorus: Big L]

Why do I end up in so much shit?
I done came way too far to be calling it quits
Jake wanna lock me up
Even though I'm legit
They can't stand to see
A young brother's pockets get thick (2x)

[Verse Two]

Ayo pardon I'm cocky
Apollo Brown before he lost to Rocky
You Pacquiao in his prime
And even then you couldn't box with me
I kept the Glock with the pocket
Before I had the option
Of making this music pop off
I was on the block with the rocket
I'm a narcissist
I'm trying to beat the odds before the Parkinsons
Got a couple throw away verses
That are deeper than your hottest shit
I promise this
That's word to all my niggas
With they seats back
Puffin a blunt to relax
Bet a million that we make it
I was the illest nigga
Coming out of that wack ass scene
You was stuck in the matrix
I'm too iLL like honey and bacon
Now your legacy's wasted
A bunch of dirty business at the banquet
Got you looking like a freak show
What the fuck you niggas thinkin
Yo I ain't worried
I'm eating this curry
While I'm peepin the birdie
I'm laughin at stories
That bitches try to hide for the glory
I've been chilla than Magilla Gorilla
I've been steady like the stones of a pillar
I've been stackin the skrilla
See money bands, money bands
I wan't a hundred grand in my hand
And if I did it all for myself
Then I'd be lying dead to my family
That's a Grammy nigga
That's for my brother Papa J
Even if I died tomorrow
I better get one anyway
Ayo the villain is back
And I'm still convinced
That niggas' is wack
You get pushed to the back
If you still debate if Fredo is fact
That Seriphic fact
That gutta rap
We bringing it back
And I want the heads of corrupted officers
Killing Black and Brown people

[Chorus: Big L]

Why do I end up in so much shit?
I done came way too far to be calling it quits
Jake wanna lock me up
Even though I'm legit
They can't stand to see
A young brother's pockets get thick (2x)
