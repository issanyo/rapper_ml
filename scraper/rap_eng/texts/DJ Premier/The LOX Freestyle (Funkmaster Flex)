[Sheek Louch]

Mutha'fucker when the cameras off you back to soft
Nigga when you by yourself you scared to cough
Bloodshot look in my eye,
Too much liquor in me
Look deeper
See the Grim Reaper in me
My blade turn white to red tees
Hawk the size of Croc Dundee's
I bury you wherever you could only you skiis
And I bring it to any one of ya dawgs like fleas
You can start burning your candles now
And tell police last time you saw em
He already ashes get a jar out for em
Fuck that if he wanna bring you could head
I make niggas scared to come home to they beds
Thug mu'fuckers gon talk to the fed
40 cal lift yo little daughter off her sled
I leave the whole snowman red; Walk With Me
Your niggas is (bitches) and soft as (pussy)
Where you going ain't shit in the truck
Stop acting like ya hammer there, when ya camera there
Ride on me ima chop off ya (clapping) mother ear
Catch y'all motherfuckers out there slippin
Smack niggas up and I ain't even had the clip in
400 horses I ain't even put the chip in
Get off my... y'all make me sick
And I bring it to any nigga who ain't my clique
D-Block 354 a whole lot changed
Smack cowards if they look at me strange
Yeah I know my niggas is thugs; Walk With Me
Timbs and sweats and the jeans that don't fit me
I take a nigga whole face
[?] won't be no case
Fucking faggots better stay in yo place
Styles P whattup

Ayo
Never get caught holdin' a grams
Never take a bitch word over ya mans, stay close to him
Never let em know where you live
Never let em get familiar with your dough or your kids
Put the toast to em
Always stay quiet and humble
Don't be scared to take it to the knife or the gun in the rumble
I can show you how to get your neck broke
Stretch coke, in the middle of the ocean on a mean duplex boat
Look here there is no competitor
See nine with the spaceship doors that open up regular
Get it on with the hard plastic
My 16's have niggas feelin' like they trippin' off acid
Trust me I can't see a loss
And know that if you whack me you can't be a boss
Ride or die cry or lie get your hustle on
Hold D-Block down for life truly yours (mwah/muah)
Jada come through controlling a Porsche
Haters shaking like Ali holdin' a torch, Walk With Me
D-Block you heard Sheek
Still sold more than P Diddy my first week
Let it be known
For them other cats I raised y'all fags
So y'all want a gun fight or play razor tag
I hurt tracks and I disperse tracks
Worked out only on my wrist
So the fifth wont jerk back
S.P. where you at baby
D-Block

Ayo my aura see mystical
I flow for the street corner niggas dos house and municipal
Niggas in the bing locked down with they principles
Let me smoke a blunt and ima show you what the mentha do
Respect over money any day of the week
I might blow to be a billionaire or lay in the street
I can tell you what my destiny is, but
Im the hardest nigga out
And I can tell you what the recipe is
Get try life on the streets; running with niggas
That get down
So all I know is my knife and my heat
And all i needs a mic and a beat to explain to you niggas
That I'm the ghost and I got rights to the streets
Every night I fights with the beast
Since my soul I won't sell
So I feel (gill?) when I roll up on L
I got a lot of spirit in me
Check the next sentence
You got more than 5 senses you can hear it in me
Hold up, Hold the fuck up!

(Funk Flex)
Yeah hold up,                               (Jadakiss)
hold up slow it down                  D-Block
Rock that Kid, lets go)

Told you I'm the ghost to this
Burner in the bubble coat
Ridin in the hoopty with
Niggas that be (holdin?) shit
Told you Ima gangsta nigga
Show you how to pop a 38
At a nigga head and straight up shank a nigga

[Jadakiss]

Its the streets Flex, I'm sorry tomorrow baby that's how we gotta do it

[?]

Ayo we all gon' die so who gon' cry for us
Hope in they whip and ride for us
Pop niggas in the set in the frame
I can't help but curse like its
Love of the game
My niggas will call a [?] with your government name
But I'm still loading my guns, getting it on
If a nigga get...

[Jadakiss]
