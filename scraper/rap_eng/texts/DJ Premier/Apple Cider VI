I got them Koi fish aspects even above water
Rock the robe from my armoire to steer lambs to the slaughter
I love it when I'm thought of but aware it will not last
I can lie and say I don't care which makes caring seem crass
Here's a toast to another day's passed, and it's gone
About to grab my pen and mic to get Oscar Wilde on
These dumb fuck listeners who wouldn't even miss me
If I faded from existence like Tony Stark's team
The content of my wine glass has me feeling invincible
But when it evaporates I'm back to being miserable
Heaven knows I'm miserable now and always
Quick to buck 50 those who claim that its a phase
Reroute the drought of those dying of thirst
To the proprietors dehydrating all of the of the 3rd world
If its all the same to you I will abandon reticence
To move in and take over as a taste of their own medicine
Renaissance rap is on the come back, baby
When these trendy rap artists look at me like I'm crazy
Stick a fork in them and then toss them in my oven
To exude like Wu that I ain't nothing to fuck with
I paw the ground before recording a verse
To enthrall you all with sound with the support of some words
I am the storm before the calm meant to reawaken Earth
Ever since I slit my palm with that blade it still hurts
My style is sacrificial for my blood lies within this
Do not knock my hustle or my operating system
For it is that devotion that serves as my step above the rest
While I'm yet to be perceived as a threat
Pulling lyrics out of thin air to use to pave a road with
These cobblestones I laid down probably won't hold
Hopefully they will and be the path to where I crave
Where my dreams have come true and where I'm warm and safe
