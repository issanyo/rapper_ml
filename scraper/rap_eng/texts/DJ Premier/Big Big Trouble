You'd do
Much better without me
'Cause I'm trouble
I am big big trouble
And I know how
To make you shake, babe
Lose all feeling
In your face

You can try and make me wait
You sayin' if I'm lucky
Maybe I'll get to taste you
Yeah you can try and make me wait
But you're in trouble
In a big, big way

You knew the mess you'd get into
Roaming alone after dark
And there's no return from the places we went to
Roaming alone in the dark

I feel you looking, but I can't see anything
With these empty eyes
And this empty chest
And I am hunting for your noble blood
Baby you're in trouble
You're in big big trouble
And I will eat you up before you can finish me
Just tide me over
Replenish me

You'd do
Much better without me, babe
'Cause I am trouble
You know I'm big, big trouble

You knew the mess you'd get into
Roaming alone after dark
When there's no return from the places you went to
Roaming alone in the dark
