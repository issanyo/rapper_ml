[Jeru The Damaja]
Life is the result of the struggle between dynamic opposites
Form and Chaos, Substance and Oblivion, Light and Dark
And all the infinite variations of Yin and Yang
When the pendulum swings in favour of one
It will eventually swing in favour of it's opposite
Thus the balance of the universe is maintained
