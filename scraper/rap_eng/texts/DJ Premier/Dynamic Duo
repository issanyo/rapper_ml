[Sampled Intro]
"And the game won't change just the same old thing.." (x2)
"Preemo"
"Dynamic Duo" (x2)

[Verse 1: JC Assassin]
The duo dynamic, sinking the Titanic’s
It’s automatic if you play around, it gon' be climatic
Choppers coming to your porch, turn your neighborhood to Columbine
Me and G15, twin choppers, double homicide
Double jeopardy, and now your family lives jeopardized
Niggas bugging out so I’m grabbing pesticide
Wait for me to come out on this expedition
Split decisions, split personality’s opinion
Y'all had to screw up bout as bad as my doctor did
Bomb to the neighborhood watch, it kill your foster kids
Currently giving certainty of emergency
The absurdity of your words will murder you internally
For eternity, my extensions extensive
Excessive, forensics ain’t nothing effective
The new Rae and Ghostface, making you a cold case
G15 will put your head on the showcase

[Hook: 개코]
이 험한 현실에서 아직 붙잡아두고 싶은 꿈
높고 힘든 삶의 능선에서 때론 포기하고 싶은 꿈
너와 천천히 오래 걷고 싶어, until the end of time
지금 난 간절히 원해 한 조각의 peace of mind
에야호 에야호 에야호 에야호 (x2)

[Verse 2: gamemast15r]
G15 rolls like the lifestyles of rich and famous
The clips with stainless; don't try to intimidate, you just an ignoramus
The kitchen made us, like this is the shit that happens
When the crime lords come together and clean crack off of the stitch and fabric
This shit is magic, and we all prosper til' the end of time
No reason to fear cause we sent all the En's to die
Stacks and stacks of money making material
Rubbing off the fingerprints and scratching off all the serials
Now we living in mansions, yachts and condos down in the Islands
Silence is the key to moving bricks, or else you have to move to violence
And that's no man's land, it's a place of random interludes
Chances are high of bullets flying into you
That's the type of bullshit that only the sinful do
You'll end up in prison, serving all of your kin some food
And it's all possible, with guard dogs that look like Cujo
Pay back all the people you owe, we the Dynamic Duo

[Hook]

[Verse 3: gamemast15r & Almighty U-Sorcerer]
We’ll put you a cold six thousand meters into the ground
Shots to your family, hang the noose around
Make your death look like an accident, what’s happenin'?
The way your body looks will make you look like you used an ounce
Might pull up on your block and fire rounds unannounced
Your world is blackening, even though police examining
You won't ever find nothing, police is never catchin' shit
Ninja blades formed like they were asterisks
Disappear like magic bitch, Ghostface moving fishscale
Got the Bruce Wayne gadgets, choppers all Chris Bale
Got a throne room made of stacks of dollars, you wonder how we live well
Cocaine in the oxygen, high when I go to inhale
Never get high on your own supply, but if it makes you flow
Then throw your hands in the air, in order to make it snow
I make it rain, I’m a young dictator
A true filmmaker, we kill it with no disclaimer
