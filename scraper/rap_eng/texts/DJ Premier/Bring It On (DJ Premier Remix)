"I biggity bring it" - Das EFX 'Real Hip Hop'

[Verse One: Guru]
To all virtuous light seekers, lift your souls let's unite
The secret truth, the deepest proof of the heights of our birth rights
My heart strikes on mics as if I'm, stronger than passion
The more intense the love the much more longer the lasting
Today I'm fasting, controlling hunger, never falling under
Parts weight a ton, particular, similar to the sun
So when you come you best to bring it strong
The clock is ticking baby you best to bring it on

[N'dea Davenport]
My love is deeper than the ocean higher than a mountain
And I'm gonna keep on reaching for the sun
Can't no other steal my heart or dampen my desire
Oh yeah baby you're the one to turn me on

[Hook: N'dea Davenport]
So bring it on
"I biggity bring it"
On, on
And I'm gonna keep on reaching for the sun
So bring it on
"I biggity bring it"
On, on
Come and get with this it's time to get it on

[Verse Two: N'dea Davenport]
I've been waiting for some kind of sign your ship is sending
Patience is the thing my heart don't wanna know
Yeah we've come a long way but my love I am depending
Don't you try to fight the feeling let it flow

[Hook]

[Verse Three: N'dea Davenport]
Don't take a fool, a fool to see
That your are the one for me stop faking me out
It's still a thrill to be down with you so baby please don't mess me around
Come on

[Verse Four: Guru]
You know you can't fight the feeling when the adrenaline hits
I'm here to take your pain away baby like medical kits
The more effort you put in baby the better it gets
So recognize the real and hold a brother down
Fake snakes back in the past almost sold a brother way down the river
Respect the clout, check out the rush I give ya
These days are hectic, there's no time to bring it wrong
Our time is precious so bring it on
