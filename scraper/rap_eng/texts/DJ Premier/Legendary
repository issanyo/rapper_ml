[Intro: Panchi]
Ha
You used to us yet?
Sha told you to get used to us
We been legenday, it's nothing
Year Round Records
Yeah
From all over
Worldwide, Tri State
Pop off

[Sample 2x]
"From hood to the 'burbs, everyone of you niggas heard of me
Shit I'm legendary," "shit I'm legendary"

[Verse 1: Nick Javas]
I came into this game for a purpose
Not to get pursed quick, but to reach the people with my verses
I knew it when I first spit, wasn't the nastiest
It still gave me chills cause I was reaching the masses
Grabbed the mic and never passed it
Stealing shows like a bandit and I never even planned it
Thought I would be a legend in athletics but when I had to dead it
I just found another sport, man I love this game
I'm above the lames who do it for the fortune and fame
And that's what makes me one of the greaty
Jumps on a Premier track, burning your ear wax
Was in a fight with my chick when I was writing this
And that's what separates the legends from the peasants
When I'm dead and gone, you'll feel my presence
From the top of my egg head, down to where my leg ends
I got what it takes to be a leg-end

[Hook 2x: Scratches by DJ Premier]
"From hood to the 'burbs, everyone of you niggas heard of me
Shit I'm legendary," "shit I'm legendary"
"I don't give a fuck about you or your weak crew"
"There's a long list of high-profile celebrities"
"From hood to the 'burbs, everyone of you niggas heard of me
Shit I'm legendary," "shit I'm legendary"
"I don't give a fuck about you or your weak crew"
"There's a long list of street legends"

[Verse 2: Shabeeno]
How your boy hot as summer get as cold as winter
Cool, calm, collective, got my own agenda
If my flow offends ya, must be no contender
So control your temper, I put the holes up in ya
I ain't the gossiping type and I don't just pop on the mic
Yeah I was born [?] with niggas up in the heights
I got Dominicans in tenements waiting on me
To give the word, I got the word, ya niggas hating on me
I'm Kane, I'm Kool G., I'm the 18th Letter
All wrapped in one, but I don't rap like them
And I don't rap for real, I just talk to niggas
Paint pictures so vivid, think I draw my lyrics
Made my way into the game just supplying some packs
I'm in the booth, but you're a fool think I'm relying on raps
Yeah I was raised in the concrete where the streets ain't pleasant
Get it fucked up, brethren, Shy, I am legend

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Blaq Poet]
They say I'm legendary, I'm here to bury you weak niggas is weary
I run up on you and pop your fucking cherry
Ya niggas is pussy, ya niggas don't want it
That Queensbridge bullshit, yeah I'm on it
I've been doing this hardcore shit since
I was a little nigga playing on the park bench
But now I'm Weapon X, cut ya nigga's fucking necks
Keep y'all niggas ducking, never know what's coming next
I know I got to slay this shit
I fucking love it when Premo makes that crazy shit
I lay the Lord down, better obey the shit
New styles, new flows, new way to spit
Motherfucker, I spit [?]
I'm a gorilla, ya niggas is monkeys
And I'm here to take over
No, it's not Hova, it's the Blaq Bulldozer

[Hook]
