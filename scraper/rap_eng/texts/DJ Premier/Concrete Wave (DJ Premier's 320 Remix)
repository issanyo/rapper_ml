Did you ever ride a concrete wave?
Did you ever ride a concrete wave?
Did you ever ride a concrete wave?
What it say? What it say?

Pavement cracks just an accident
Pavement cracks just an accident
Pavement cracks just an accident
Money well spent till you're late on rent

What you do to fill me up
Will bring one down, just one slip up

Did you ever ride a concrete wave?
High as a kite till the crash does cave
Did you ever ride a concrete wave?
Ride me on back to the golden days

To the top my head does burn
With thoughts of you, I'll never learn

Find did you want me? Whoa
Find you want me? No
Find you want me? No
Find you want me

Did you ever try to burn a breeze?
Did you ever try to burn a breeze?
Did you ever try to burn a breeze?
Light a match, it's not easy

Add a little bit of fuel to flame
Add a little bit of fuel to fire
Add a little bit of fuel to flame
Watch it burn watch it blaze higher

Wrong ideas are quite all right
If you don't tell, let's have tonight

Did you ever try to burn a breeze?
Candles catch torching the trees
Did you ever try to burn a breeze
Eye for eye, teeth for teeth

Secrecy secrets are no fun
If you can't whisper to someone

Find did you want me? Whoa
Find you want me? No
Find you want me? No
Find you want me

Let me catch you carry you to shore
Wrap you in white tides, give you some more
Send you to the sun where asphalt glows
Melt away like putty as the wind blows
