[Verse 1: Vinny Crook$]
Strictly for my soul survivors, cutthroat connivers
I’m so nice with it, kill em with kindness
I could give em Hooks, but I got bigger fish i’m frying
Put my heart in a song like L-Boogie did for Zion
Got no sympathy for shuck and jivers, dick riders
I was cut from a different cloth, with God as my stylist
Hellen Keller blinded to the lies they televising
Raised to be humble in a jungle so violent with tyrants defiant
Where the murder rate skyrockets up higher than auto-pilots
Penning this villainous flow, I record at Arkham Asylum
I’m a buried diamond, even coal miners’ll find it hard to find this
Gotta open doors for the city, like a locksmith
Knockin’ the hinges off, now I got the game in hostage
Ruthless when I bless the mic, like i’m Straight Outta Compton
Easy does it, so you don’t wanna be starting something
I moonwalk then draw the .38 from under buckin’
Blood rushin’, concussions ain’t nothing
Got these hyenas hundred miles and running
They dropped the ball, then I picked it up
Right before the buzzer
They say you only get one shot, now i’m Jordan shrugging
You can hate it or love it

(Verse 2: Vinny Crook$)
Voodoo child, getting signals from Jimi Hendrix
I got jewels for the mind, how’s your crystal healing?
Two tears in a bucket, I’ve been crying up a river
All my friends were drug dealing, I was busy crate digging
First time I seen coke was in my uncles Honda Vigor
We all thought he was working late, instead he sniffing
In the driveway, with Cognac killing his liver
Sucka free with no limits, like Percy Miller ughhh
This the new era of rap, going over your fitted
Got the heart of Mandela, with the art of storytellin’
Andre of this generation, the North got something to say
Till the day we see Armageddon, forever playalistic
We big boys plotting on a million, outcasts (OutKasts) in the building
Minnesota cold bitch, I breathe blizzards
Ya bones quiver and shiver, when i’m gripping the mic
Got ice in my veins, in the cockpit with a
Ounce of donatello, got the plug from Master Splinter
Can’t stop the reign, better get cha umbrella
Can’t thrive in a mission, if the drive inefficient
Shitting on the competition, since I got no pot to piss in
My pockets malnutrition, my bank account insufficient
Mice crawling out my Fruity Pebbles
My life is like a tug of war with the angel and Devil
Pressure weighing on my shoulders like heavy boulders
Pimpin’ 101, i’m 1-0 to each opponent that want it
My chances of a downfall are pretty smaller than
Donald Trump getting voted by Farrakhan
I’m in tip top condition like a lighting rod
Keep a foxy brown chick, mixed with a chyna doll
Get em high off these lines, like flipping that china dawg
I be the underdog with power in my palms like Ali in Vietnam
Boom bap back jumping, Dominique Dawes
Couldn’t lock my mind or body with a task force
I’m on the road to greatness, till I crack the dashboard, umm
You ain’t in my lane, you speeding straight into a crash course
Lamborghini Aventador on you Rav-4’s
From food stamps to getting stamps on a passport
Put some respect on my motherfucking gun, whats up!!!

[Chorus]
Put the rap game on a crutch
Blow the spot without warning
You get no chance to back down
Put the rap game on a crutch
Blow the spot without warning
You get no chance to back down

(Verse 3: Vinny Crook$)
Americas most hated, underrated, barbershop debated
Spitting at paparazzi, i’m Pac reincarnated
You gotta be high off Xanax, if I ain’t one of ya favorite
I’ll be timeless when I make it, they say life is what you make it
I’m the highest in the rankings, yet the highest in the nation
Young Elijah in the making, i’m a legend in the making
Real killas move in silence in the Matrix
The oracle, Killa Mason, put in time like Pappy Mason
When i’m live in the basement, watching Rap City
With Big Tigga live in the basement
Yeah, it’s a Black Power celebration
I’m Bunchy Carter with a declaration
Semi pump, yelling fuck Trump and his legislation
400 years of waiting for liberation, 40 acres and a mule
Juggling regulations, trials and tribulations
Economies fumigated, left us in desperation
Now we busting down doors with a .44 for reparations

[Chorus]
Put the rap game on a crutch
Blow the spot without warning
You get no chance to back down
Put the rap game on a crutch
Blow the spot without warning
You get no chance to back down

(Verse 4: Vinny Crook$)
I’m the Guru of the new school, got soliloquies of chaos
Meets the Qu’ran and the Book of Psalms all in one
Lead my team into the playoffs, never take a day off
Practicing from AM to the PM till we take off
Smoking bomb kush, smell like napalm
In high school, it was nothing but bad bitches on my radar
Phife Dawg as my ghost, turn the booth into a seance
My stakes high, special thanks to De La
See I was born with a set of horns and a halo
Toting the Draco in my sonogram, rockabye in ya cradle
My only competition would be a Kendrick or J. Cole
Hands covered in stones like Thanos and they know
They can never touch this flow like the ass of J-Lo
Since Motorollas, I been had the eye of Horus
The new Messiah, i’m Ayatollah to your Diaspora
Who the king? I split the crown like Moses
If you a foreigner on my block, it’s game over
Gang members with choppers going ape shit, acting like Koba
In the kitchen with dirty aprons and baking soda
Whipping coca, like I was born in the 80’s
But a 90’s baby, raised on Marbury and KG
I’m like Curry meets KD, i’m one of the best arguably
Suicidal tendencies, with genius level artistry
I’m like Ernest Hemingway in a way when I paint
Enter the game, kickin’ magic like I got my fucking Penny’s laced

[Chorus]
Put the rap game on a crutch
Blow the spot without warning
You get no chance to back down
Put the rap game on a crutch
Blow the spot without warning
You get no chance to back down
