[Verse 1]
Here I am again, same as I was
Laid out next to you, but I got things to do

[Refrain]
But I'll take it up on Monday
I'll take 'em up on Monday

[Verse 2]
I've got calls to return
When will I ever learn
I can't be bothered now?
I'll figure out somehow

[Refrain]
When I take it up on Monday, yeah
I take it up on Monday

I take it up on Monday
I take it up on Monday

[Verse 3]
And I got calls to make
My job's at stake
But I'm feeling you now, babe

[Refrain]
So I take it up on Monday
I take it up on Monday

[Verse 4]
I got plans to break
Now you're here
I want my Sunday clear
So, I take it up on ---

[Refrain]
I take it up on Monday
I take it up on Monday
