[Lil Dap]
Yo, I'll be a black panther, all in your dreams
Up Against The Wall they jailed me cause you can't seek peace
And you ain't suppose to die a natural death, that's that
Got to work hard for mines, struggles on the line
Watchin' all these niggas in the streets for a while
Breaking down all they motherfuckin' dirt born style
I keep it real you keep it to yourself and don't say jack
Every time I turn around and you're all in my back
For what? I don't know
These devils won't leave me alone
I've been here for 20 years
I'm here to stand my ground
And these devils gettin' open but they can't get down
Sheddin' lyrics through the city like a newborn seed
These types of lyrics that's mine that's organized with the time
I'm on the road checkin' my B.I
Ideas start to come
But they sees enough success that got them all fucked up
What you want right now you may see mad later
Yo my word is divine you got to seek and find
A new place to rest my mind no more petty crime
Yo I'm up against the wall

[Nutcracker]
Yo the world is falling
Death is calling
I don't know MC's be brawling
On the mike, when I get hyped
Whenever you want yo whatever you like
Bite on my style, I like that
Yo here is your feedback with one smack
Yeah, you know what I'm saying?
No time to be playing cause these niggas be delaying
Word yo when I get busy
Here and over there to New York City
One for one, one for all
I'm on the wall my back is on the wall

Yo is a wonderful world, a world of wonder
I thunder and thunder I won't go under
Won't get in the trap I'm passed all that
You stupid mothefucka my rhyme is phat
Phat as can be on the M-I-C
In the place to be, if you can see
You don't know then go ask your momma
Eatin' MCs live like Jeffery Dahmer
One of one, one for all
I'm on the wall, I'm on the wall

[Lil' Dap]
And for the seeds in these streets rockin' rugged and hard
Innocent bystanders gettin' popped and scarred
Niggas not keeping it real and they will get barred
5-O on my back thinkin' that they are God
Brothers keep on dividing and we won't get far
The devil's on some slick shit ready to hose us down
But I maintain my focus and just hold the fort down
You all know a situation funny thing like this
Unsuspicious yellow cab riding through the East
A stereotype brother make the undercovers wonders
Got lawyers all in the East ready to shine my light
Nutcracker get him open 'fore he sparks the night
For my brothers and my sisters in the street doing their thing
My back is against the wall and can't do a damn thing
Yo I'm up against the wall
