(Beat: Hypnotize - The Notorious B.I.G.)
Hah, sicker than your average
Banish any who challenge my lyrical status
Microphone savage, king of the hip-hop palace
Hip-Hop magician, makin all these wack asses vanish
On the rise, rhymes leave you mesmerized
Hypnotized, the guy your kids’ll idolize, uh
The guy that all them jealous dudes despise
The guy that pops in your girl's mind when she fantasize, yo

(Beat: Made You look - Nas)
The guy that’ll make you look
Drop a number one record with straight bars no hook
Got’em shook, baggy clothes, J’s on each foot
Your girl givin me brain like she be gangbangin them books, ha!
She got the brain, I got them looks
She told me to give it to her and what I gave she took
I ain’t a hip-hop chef more like a gourmet cook
My rhymes like a drug, I got all y’all hooked

(Beat: Mass Appeal - Gang Starr)
That’s just part of my mass appeal
So ill, make a million bills with no deal
I got the wheel, better kneel to my superior skill
Better get ready, grab my machete and watch all the blood spill
Verses I kill, homie, shit’s about to get real
How does it feel? Punchlines hittin you harder than steel
I don’t steal but if I have to snatch the crown I will
Next Biggie Smalls, I got some big ass shoes to fill
Made your girl fall in love watchin this Filipino rap
Where she at? She’s where my frikin ego’s at
She wanted to make a movie so I Tarentino’d that
I’m like a hip-hop guru, where Preemo at?

(Beat: 4,3,2,1 - LL Cool J)
4,3,2,1, they wanted to stop me from blowin but it’s already begun
Rap boogeyman, you better either hide or run
I be killin all these wack ass rappers till there are literally none
I’m the - type of rapper who will straight lyrically attack ya
Do a feature and diss you on your own track bruh
I’m incredible, these other “MC’s” are freakin terrible
Unacceptable, rappin about trappin, pandas, and vegetables
I don’t get it, these other rappers got me baffled y’all
They careers be taking off while I’m still home watchin Dragon Ball
On my Macintosh while jacking off to Bulma, 18, Videl, and Launch
But soon I’ll go Super Saiyan and start Kamehameha blasting y’all

(Beat: ATLiens - OutKast)
A perfectionist, definition of excellence
Real talent is evident, look at me as your evidence
Arrogant - only cause I know me blowin is definite
The real leader of this residence homie, fuck a president
You local rappers step aside, your bars suck
Meet me, you’ll either be pissed off or starstruck
I’m Alaska’s premiere MC, a must watch
One shot, hip-hop’s next big thing, just watch
