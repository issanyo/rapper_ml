Raise your right and I'll blaze the living proof
The godfather to truth, clak, clak, salute

[Lil Fame]
Since we came here we got to show and prove
The M.O.P. is rugged never smooth
We tearin this shit down just like construction
Flip like kilos, with this Primo production

[Billy Danze]

Hardcore niggas on your doorstep neighbor
And this year, here, niggas can't compare
Spectators, haters, cuz we're fuckin with Premier

[Lil Fame]
Fillin 'em up wit raps in fact they can't get wit
A code red, the dope shit, got you niggas addicted
Mr. Danzenie and the Fame stayin true to this game

For the real thugs and ghetto niggas slingin toasters
On all coastses, north to south, east to west
Got high clientele for shit you least expect

[Billy Danze]
M.O.P. from the hill kid, what you tryin to tell me
Still grippin mo' steel than Machine Gun Kelly
I mention, and flinching, and waitin for you to duck the gate
And sellin shit that I won't tolerate
WSUP?! My whole team's in the house
The gat is 1 5 4 5 not four 5's in your fucking mouth
Same ones, burner on blaze
Fuck a memory, y'all remember me for bustin my thang...
