[Verse 1]
Rappers are falling off like Hip Hop is having chemotherapy
I'll let that line marinate completely
Wayniac the cook is the elephant in the room
I'm the element of doom you haven't seen a cider boom
From the womb I've been weaving on the loom
Been writing 'bout my life to the tune of my tomb
And working in my room from the moon to the moon
I'm saying, these shrews are overdue for taming
Make 'em feel like an aphid in the garden of amazing
Roses on your grave like Tuxedo Kamen
I don't give a fuck, these rappers pass away like they used to pass the Dutch
They couldn't find the flux
After hearing "Numbers On The Hoard" you'd think they had enough
But even if they're in the deli, couldn't tell the number's up
Step aside let me show you how I rough
Got a bed full of beats, a rhymebook inside the glove
Compartment, in front I got a honey giving rub
While I run these rappers down in my F-150 truck
I lay in the cut until these sirens have given up

[Verse 2]
These fools afraid to put me on because they know I'm on top
I keep walking as a stranger and rock the whole block
I got a gift that's ironically never been wrapped
It's the wrath of a rapper that's never been had
Shouts to Jeru for doing Wrath of the Math
So I can pull you from the past, I am the aftermath
Rap game Sam Beckett for that ass I'm a rook
These kings are getting checked without the power of a hook
Did y'all forget about the power of a book?
I read like a worm so you know I got 'em shook
They ain't a crook, they see words at a 5th Grade level
I'm this great, the master of the 24-bit...
