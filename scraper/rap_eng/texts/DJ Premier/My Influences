[Intro: Scratches by DJ Premier]
"Today black entertainers, singers, comedians, writers, and artists
Are getting their share of the limelight
And every week
We'll be bringing you a genuine sample of
Genius on the black side"
"Two brothers"
"Listen"
"Let me talk
Let me talk"

[Verse 1: Panchi]
I want to thank my influences for why I prevail
Hunger pains, the landlord, oh yeah, jail
Stash, cash 'nother man holdin' the gate
Made it big enough to fit so when I run off straight
New York times, we rep hard
Heard I made an Amish broad go cop an iPod
The video is rocking, iTunes's in love with us
Downloaded crazy, word the world fucks with us
(When Vel got shot), we laughed, don't believe me?
The hospital staff said you niggas was "ass"
When I was young in the town
Running wild with heat
I ruined more boys lives than a Catholic priest
Turn the other cheek
Where only [?] gets mad
On my left side thinking that his ass could creep
Back out on the whole street, you niggas know P
I've been dumbing since so young and I'm an NYG

[Hook: Scratches by DJ Premier]
"Here we go again nigga
Right back in the booth, right back in the groove"
"NYGz"
"Me and my crew make it our duty to get back on the streets"
"Here we go again nigga
Right back in the booth, right back in the groove"
"NYGz"
"Name a rapper that I ain't influenced"

[Verse 2: Shabeeno]
I put my heart in my music, cats I went to school with
Back in their minds like, "This nigga still doing it?"
Speak Ebonics, probably blowing their chronic
Back in their minds, "Damn, this nigga still go it?"
Yup, ain't lose a step and my swag is still good
Street certified, that's why my raps be so hood
And y'all could ask Suge we got a timeless flow
We sound like Big and Hov flowing on Death Row
Cross me and force me to try to get the Feds off
Cuz we gon' to hit the streets trying to take each other head off
Hydrochlorothiazide won't be bringing down my pressure
Guess I won't relax 'til I see you on a stretcher
I fuks with Game but he be buggin' on things
Somebody tell him, LeBron won a couple of rings
This the hustler's thing, we call it "Get Money Music"
And we don't have to prove it, y'all can Youtube it

[Hook]

[Outro 2x: Scratches by DJ Premier]
"NYGz"
"They knew the time"
"New York Gz"
