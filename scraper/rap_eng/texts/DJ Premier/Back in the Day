[Intro]
What we're gonna do right here is go back
Way back, back into time
Yeah, yeah-yeah
(Donny Hathaway, Leena Horne)
(Miss Aretha, (The Real Thing) James Brown, Billie Holiday)
(Stevie Wonder, Gladys Knight, Louis Armstrong)
(Minnie Riperton, Otis Redding, Etta James)

[Verse 1]
Back in the day, they used to say:
"Play that song, get it goin'" and the band played
And still today, you hear us say
"Play that song all night long, Mr. DJ"
Though times have changed, it's still the same
We all need a minute to get away
So let it go and feel the flow
If you've got soul, let the world know

[Pre-Chorus]
We're gonna set the mood (set the mood off right)
Gonna go back to an old school groove
(Go back to an old school groove)
Gonna rewind to another time
When the originators, innovators were alive, yeah

[Chorus]
Here we say now
So break out the Marvin Gaye and Etta James
Your Lady Day, and Coltrane
Turn up your 45's, bring back to life
The sound and vibe of yesterday
Open your mind, enjoy the ride
Get out tonight and grab that Soul Train (take it back, take it)
Back in the day, back in the day
Aw baby, back in the day, back in the day
Won't you take me back?
Back in the day, back in the day (I'll do it)
Back in the day, back in the day
(Y'all remember back in the day, you dig)
(Ray Charles, Nat King Cole, Miles Davis, Ella Fitzgerald)

[Verse 2]
Now "Chain of Fools" and "Respect"
Was the anthem of a woman, Aretha said
"What's Goin' On", "Let's Get It On"
Such classic songs, don't forget them
Though times have changed
They still remain my inspiration everyday
So give it up for the ones
Who came before, opened up that door

[Pre-Chorus]
We're gonna (we're gonna) set the mood
(Set the mood)
Gonna go back (go back) to an old school groove
(To an old school groove)
Gonna rewind (rewind) to another time (another time, yeah)
When the originators, innovators were alive, yeah

[Chorus]
So break out the Marvin Gaye and Etta James
Your Lady Day, and Coltrane (Coltrane)
Turn up your 45's, bring back to life
The sound and vibe of yesterday (of yesterday)
Open your mind, enjoy the ride
Get out tonight and grab that Soul Train (take it back, take it)
Back in the day, back in the day
Aw baby, back in the day, back in the day
Won't you take me back?
Back in the day, back in the day (I'll do it)
Back in the day, back in the day

[Bridge]
So get up, relive it
Gotta let yourself go
Give up your praise
Come celebrate
Just get up, get on it
Get yourself on the floor
Don't back away (don't back away)
Come celebrate (gonna celebrate, yeah)

[Chorus]
So break out the Marvin Gaye and Etta James
Your Lady Day, and Coltrane
Turn up your 45's, bring back to life
The sound and vibe of yesterday
Open your mind, enjoy the ride
Get out tonight and grab that Soul Train
(Taking it back, back in he day)
Back in the day, back in the day
Back in the day, back in the day
Back in the day, back in the day (back in the day, yeah)
Back in the day, back in the day
Aw baby, I'll do it, aw baby, oh woah, woah
Yeah yeah, whoa, whoa, yeah
(Back in the day)
Hey
