[Intro:]
Now I don’t be foolin' around, I tell the truth. Nothing’s secret

[Verse 1: Jeru the Damaja]
As devils search for the secrets to immortality
I alter my physical chemistry
Walk through the valley of the shadow of death
I exist even when no things are left
Vibrations transcend space and time
Pure at heart because I deal with the mind
That's why I compose these verses
Audible worlds, my thoughts are now universes
Written on these pages is the ageless wisdom of the sages
Ignorance is contagious
So I hope you keep your focus
There's no hocus-pocus, in the end it's just us
Devil got brother killin brother, it's insane
Goin out like Abel and Cain
Wisen up and use your brain
There'll be no limit, to the things that you can gain
In positivity, balance it with negativity
Until then, ain't the Devil happy

[Hook]
[Scratching in the RZA's famous laugh on the song "Tearz" by The Wu-Tang Clan]

[Verse 2: Jeru the Damaja]
I hate when the Devil's happy, so I wear my hair nappy
Knotty, won't go out like John Gotti
He came from the caves to destroy everybody
And we like fools destroy our own bodies
Too many niggas chilling, bad boys boom boom
This leaves no room for the flowers to bloom
Seeds blow in the wind, another drug killing
What are we accomplishing? Nothing
What's the matter?
Why everytime I look around another brain gets splattered?
Some pockets get fatter but it don't matter
The Devil's the only one who really gets fatter
Lead ruptures flesh, spleens are shattered
Dreams are shattered, another Queen without a King
What will our children become without proper guidance?
Probably nothing, so ain't the Devil happy

[Verse 3: Jeru the Damaja]
Niggas are in a state of nothingness
Hopelessness, lifelessness
If you're in range, I hope you hear this
And try to change this 'cause it's disastrous
Who gets the most loot? Who gets bust?
Dollar bill y'all is the god we trust
The days blow by like dust,even Men of Steel rust
We're out here acting ridiculous, when only we can save us
Mentally enslave us for little or nothing, kill our neighbors
Animalistic, cannibalistic behavior
Look to the sky for your Savior
He won't save ya, he didn't save your forefathers
Why bother, brothers?
You must discover the power of self
Know thyself or find thyself
Hating thyself, killing thyself
While he collects the wealth that you sit back and murder for
Ain't the Devil happy?
