[Intro]
Chik chika chika chik
To the beat rock
Bumpy Knuckles (word)
Premo, rock, rock on
To the beat (This is my shit right there, B)
Hardcore, underground
Boom bap forever
Niggas said your was lazy Preem
They bugging
Yo

[Verse 1]
Do y'all really miss hip-hop? (Hell yeah!) Well I miss y'all too
Well in fact I miss you so much, here's what I'm gon' do
Im'ma lay down a nice barrage of hot bars
That equal to the sum of me and the drum
Head nod for you haters tryna figure me out
Fuck rapping, if you want it, let the triggers be out
Cause all this "cool then we beefing then we cool then we beefing
Then we cool", shit ain't cool
You let corny niggas tell you that your music was wack
Then you switch your whole style, now you dressing like that
And you acting like that, and you talking like that
How we 'spposed to look at you when New York bring it back
It's more music for the minds to intake
But while intaking it, you misrepresent how we making it
This might be deep for you surface ass niggas
Stuck on the surface, with no verses with
Nobody want to hear your shit no more
I'm still underground rocking it raw
I'm still an eyesore to MC's
I soar, fold to terror, from the Golden Era, mic wars

[Bridge: Scratches by DJ Premier]
Niggas had their run, now it's time for change
When we step in the club, nigga tuck your chain

[Verse 2]
I'm a beast with the voice projectors
Tap beats on your face [?] quick with the jaw connectors
Salute to the boom bap beat collectors
My lectures over this Preem perfection
Flip word like a word flipper, the mic ripper rip mics
Show up to shows with bikes
While y'all still sucking for a deal
And you do a whole tour for some pussy and a meal, and call it real
My nigga [?] back with the Alvin and the Chipmunks
The fifth dump, and you'll be getting zip from that trip chump
This boom bap is like boom bump
Yeah it's DJ Premier and the underground goon Bump
