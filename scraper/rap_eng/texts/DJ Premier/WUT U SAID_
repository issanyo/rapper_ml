(Intro)
Yo what's good two time?
What up G'z how were you?
Ain't nothing man you know me
Same s*** different toilet I can't call it i'ma cako hornet
Ayo! What's up with your man that you caught that little thing with over there?
Nothing man
It hurts and If I be movin' real I be man
Nah man! Not my man he won't do that
You got the call to my city
Matter fact ain't that son classic building right there?
Where you at?
I'M ON HIS BODY!!!!!!!

(Hook x2)
Whut u said n****?
With this gun to your head n****?
Oh you a dead n****
Hope that don't go over your head n****

(Verse 1)
You came home gave you chips gave you kicks (You was my man!)
We caught a lick I gave you the whole brick
Paid your lawyer so you charge in 1 stick (Get outta jail!)
Now you flipped heard you was talking s*** (Can't believe this s***!)
When I put you on your feet
Now I gotta put you 6 feet (Pitaroll!)
Oh you think this s*** is sweet?
Well i'm the candyman keep hammers like a handyman (You know I got it!)
I'mma spin your block around 8 (Where you at?)
With a 9 hit a n**** 10 times (In his back!)
Or 11 you know how I move
Put a p**** on the Channel 12 News
I get the ooze like the exterminator
Or the pump terminate him like i'm Terminator
Squanchin' n****'s squanchin' n****'s i'll offer n****
Have your homie lighting candle and pouring liquor (R.I.P.!)

(Hook x2)
Whut u said n****?
With this gun to your head n****?
Oh you a dead n****

(Verse 2)
I'm the type to watch your house if you don't watch your mouth
I ring your bell while the other homie watchin' out (same thing!)
Bring! Y'all be clear to see (Uh huh!)
Last thing you seen was that infrared beam
Oh! you a gangsta n**** proove it! (Show me!)
I move with that s*** they shoot up the schools with (Got it!)
Columbine, Afghanistan I'm droppin' bombs
I'm sendin' hits my alibi recordings on (Get that n****!)
Poppin' s*** right into this for talkin' wrong
F*** sendin' threats I'm DMX Get At Me Dog
You n****'s bloggin' on computers

Roll the clips on the Reuger
