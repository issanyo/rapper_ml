Yo, listen, niggas think they better than me, you know what I mean?

[Hook 1]

I have a crown cuz I'm the king of this shit
Niggas see me and say "Torné you're too lit"
I left all my family without legs
The voice in my head said "Torné you're too lit"

[Verse]

Sometimes I think I have tourettes
Cuz whenever I speak I can't stop talking shit
And now I'm high off that motherfucking weed
Niggas plead to me to stop being me
But I say fuck these niggas, bring me the liquor
Have me a bitch making my dick bigger
I need to recover from these niggas taking over
But they better catch me only when I'm sober
Cuz if I see 'em high, they'll surely die
I'll ride then I'll fly into the sky
People know I'm their worst nightmare
Creep behind you then kill you when the light's thin
And in the dark air, you'll know Satan's there
Staring at you while you slowly meet your death
And then you go to hell, hope you do well
I'll catch up when I meet your coward ass there

[Hook 2]

Satanic verses I spit from the top of my lips
Torné you're too lit, Torné you're too lit
So, Satan we finally meet
Torné you're too lit, Torné you're too lit
