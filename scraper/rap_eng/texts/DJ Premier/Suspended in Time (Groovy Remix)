Verse 1: [Lil Dap]
Son started in Brooklyn and you all know that
I call you son for a reason
That means nothing can come between us
When we walk these streets
Lyrics do get deep
Because were born to die
Shed tears and cry
Mom dukes passed away when you was locked up son
They had you, suspended in time
So why kick rhymes
Niggas livin off your fears and ideas to get paid
Brothas makin the bounce and protect your wealth
And this punk style niggas screamin out for help
And theres nothin in this world better than life it self

Verse 2: [Melachi]
Young fools break rules, mic tools got me open
Im smokin, leavin all the punk rappers broken
No jokin, hoping for the best
East to west, Im like a killer puttin rappers in their rest
Cuz theres no tricks, when I let off clips
I leave bodies in ditches, play bitch niggas like bitches
Nutcracker doin hits by the dozen
When I make moves, I ride the train with my cousin
Nowhere near simple
My mental, flex more complex than mozart's instrumental
From my temple, times a bad sign
And if you're doin that
Your suspended in time

Chorus: [Amel Larrieux]
Suspended [repeat x2]
I’ve got so much on my mind
So much on my mind
Suspended in time
I’m just thinkin’ about my life
I’m just thinkin’ thinkin’ thinkin’
Suspended in time
I’ve got so much on my mind
Suspended in time
I’m just thinkin’ about my life
[ad-libs]

Verse 3: [Lil Dap]
Yo son, I think about my soul
Cuz this shell is just a frame
Only used for money, hustlin and playin the game
I want my chance to live long
What like Marvin Gaye, I may be dead and gone
But my word will be born
This is for my niggas and chicks
Who live in the ghetto
We walk the..streets of gold, diamond pearls and girls
And theres nothin better than this course were in the new world
Seein people everywhere that I thought I saw before
Check it out party people as we reign supreme
Yo the Group Home manifest got mad love for the team

Verse 4: [Melachi]
I know that it's tough comin up in the streets
You will be strong because you can't be beat
You gotta put your mind on achieve mode
Go for your goals boom boom explode
Everybodys in the way but they can't hold you back
That's how it is and we do it like that
Yeah..so show whatchu got
No time for fakin moves, the time is wastin on the clock
You know how I rock, I rock non stop
Hop on stage, you jump on my jock
Here's a dope rhyme one time for your mind
If you deaf dumb and blind your suspended in time

Chorus: [Amel Larrieux]
Suspended in time
I’m suspended
So much on my mind
Suspended in time
I’m just thinkin’ about my life
Suspended in time
Hey yeah
So much on my mind
So much on my mind
I’m just thinkin’ about my life
Yeah yeah
So much on my mind
I’m just thinkin’ thinkin’ thinkin’
I’ve got so much, so much on my mind
[ad-libs]
So much on my mind
So much on my mind
Yeah
So much on my mind
