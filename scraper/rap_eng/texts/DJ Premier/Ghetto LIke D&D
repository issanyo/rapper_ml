"It's real"
"Ghetto like D&D"
"All"

"Bad on the mic"
"It's real"
"Ghetto like D&D"
"All"
"Stars"
"For you"

[Verse One: Krumb Snatcha]
I'm more complex than a Cubix when invading your spot
Peak out a 100 watts, watch your eardrums pop
Got this rap shit locked
Plus I'm holding the master
Key for you to see and I'm stepping to snatch ya
Capture melodies like felonies on run
Watch ya brain burst spitting this verse through the tongue
Human magnum
It's aiming and I'm ready to discharge
To kick hard like kung-fu flicks in ya mix god
Blaze through flannel
And rearrange and change like channels
Come through, destroy you and your hip hop panels
Making your head jerk till ya neck hurt
Lyrical expert
Set it up, bomb the perimeter

[Verse Two: Teflon]
Y'all niggas is bringing knives to a gunfight
I'm one hype motherfucker that come right
At all times
See me on The Chorus Line
Eight bars and pass
Give us four stars
It's the all-star cast line up
Nigga ya time's up
We comin' at cha
And after Krumb Snatcha snatch ya worldly possessions
I got strict orders to clap ya
Six oughta relax ya
One to the melon for good measure
To let y'all niggas know the type of shit that we after

[Scratch Hook]

[Verse Three: Q-Ball]
Yo it's the Q-B so watch what you saying
Your mouth is writing checks that yo ass ain't paying
While your team brick laying we got dream team stats
QNC, heavy cream cats, my car gleam wax
You trying to get a bitch while we trying to get rich
My leather button up stitch
Trunk smell like snitch
Your whole style glitch
Fire squad up off the handle
NYC scandal
Bald headed mic vandal

[Verse Four: Curt Cazal]
It's um, we two
On this paper chase caper
Eight precise figures, fade niggas like a taper
At 20 inch on your BM's type shit
We on
And shine like the glimmer off my charm
It's like
Lyrical harm when the piece touch my palm
It's the storm before the calm
John Blaze, four alarm
With that [?]
For you and your whole clique
Knock the screws out [?] and bomb your whole shit

[Verse Five: Starang Wondah]
Ayo we scheme on the riches
Got cars and bitches
Put these rappers under pressure
Till they break like dishes
Got y'all niggas saying "aah ooh"
Y'all know who this is
Call mad rappers out, my crew give niggas the business
Some say we belong in a Cage like Nicholas
Gauge inconspicuous
Mad niggas come out but then look ridiculous
Cause Starang always be on some different shit
Either on the move or on the ave just kicking it
Trying to move fast
Or driving by slow smoking weed with hash
So don't ask
The M.F.C
B.C.C
Ghetto like D&D on MTV
