[Intro]
Being enlightened is no longer enough, you must apply
Being willing is no longer acceptable, you must do
Make it count

[Pre-Chorus]
Na-na-nah!
I gotta shake this
Na-na-nah!

[Chorus]
I gotta shake this jail shit off me
"He ain't gon' never sell, he gonna fail" shit off me, I
I gotta shake this, weak shit off me and keep shit off me
And leave it in the streets like, "Bitch, get off me!"

[Verse 1]
1977, July 5th
Conceived immaculately was me, my mom's gift
Unwrapped right there in a room like Christmas
My mind has been designed to do like distance
Run whole laps around y'all with my thoughts
You ain't hold back on yours, nah that's my fault
Now picture me falling
All the way to the bottom and I'm laying there calling
"Somebody come help me," find my strength
To stop drinking this poison, 'fore I drown my gift
And yeah it's prolly unhealthy, 'cause I went so hard
And woke up sober, I lost my good friend & broke up soldiers
Loco, going hard as a locomotive, self-loathing
Like I ain't chosen, shows to bless souls get exposed
Just know that I ain't folding

[Chorus]
I gotta shake this, shake this
I gotta shake this jail shit off me
"He ain't gonna never sell, he gonna fail shit" off me
I gotta shake this weak shit off me and keep shit off me
And leave it in the streets like, "Bitch, get off me!"

[Verse 2]
September 18th, 2006
I roll up in the court thinking, "This should go quick"
On some couple-thousand-dollar-suit-type shit
From behind thousand dollar Cartier 'scrips
I witnessed my world tumble down like bricks
Two words she slurred and they sounded like this
"One year," traveled through the room
Like moonlight, through the darkness
Ooh, it's heartless, how could I beat two felonies
Then turn around and lose, and lose like this?
My lawyer’s saying stay calm, people saying, "Pray for him"
They locking my black ass up like Akon
My wife at the crib going crazy
Pregnant, yelling, "I ain’t having no more babies!"
People saying Preem ain’t fucking with me no more
Niggas in the pen looking homo, no, no!

[Chorus]
I gotta shake this, shake this, na-na-na
I gotta shake this jail shit off me
"He ain't gonna never sell, he gonna fail" shit off me
I gotta shake this weak shit off me and keep shit off me
And leave it in the streets like, "Bitch, get off me!"

[Verse 3]
Fresh outta jail feeling like Christopher Walken
The king of my city, swinging my dick as I’m walking
Up to the 750, I open the door
My cuz and like several bitches make up the décor
I look in he got a cup and he pours
I tell him, "Nah, I’m good," I would’ve chugged it before
I’m a new man but I could fuck with a whore
Nigga, my dick so hard it’s prolly touching the floor
Riding 'round in the back of a black luxury toy
Getting sucked, like niggas cannot fuck with me, boy
When I look in the mirror, all I see is the real
Your nigga shouldn’t be here, R.I.P. if you will
I’m the moment of truth, I’m the only significant thing
Roaming the scene, soon as I go in the booth
I'ma do it this time, I'm feeling really defined
Unsigned to signed, nigga the city is mine

[Chorus]
I gotta shake this, shake this, na-na-na
I gotta shake this jail shit off me
"He ain't gonna never sell, he gonna fail" shit off me
I gotta shake this weak shit off me and keep shit off me
And leave it in the streets like, "Bitch, get off me!"
I gotta shake this jail shit off me
"He ain't gonna never sell, he gonna fail" shit off me
I gotta shake this weak shit off me and keep shit off me
And leave it in the streets like, "Bitch, get off me!"

[Outro]
Bitch, get off me!
Get off me!
Bitch get off me!
Now do that make me a liar?
Get off me!
Get off me!
Get off me!
