[Intro: J-Hood]
Ayo Premo
They definitely wasn't expecting this

[Scratches by DJ Premier]
"Never be as nice"
"Never be as nice"
"Never be as nice"
"Get it popping"
"Never be as nice"

[J-Hood]
History in the making right here
What do y'all know about it man?
Uh, uh, yo"

[Verse 1]
Ain't none of y'all niggas never gon' be nice as the God is
Screw your bank account and how deep your squad is
If it wasn't for the M-I-C, I don't know where I'd be
In the box or the B-I-N-G
Ever since I was a peewee, I always wanted to rap
Kept the lock in the socks 'case a nigga wanted to scrap
Had a bounce like you wouldn't believe
When Nasty Nas was in the stands in the P's rocking army fatigue
Use to steal my brother's tapes to come out with my format
Then I learned how to lay it down like a doormat
Outkast, Heltah Skeltah, Boot Camp, and the Wu
Biggie, Pac, Jigga, Snoop, and Nasty too
I got slick with the flow, the old heads used to make bets
Trunks open, Geto Boyz banging in the tape deck
And that was way before everybody had gats
In them years, they was still chasing niggas with bats

[Hook]
"This is how we do"
"I'm on my grind"
"Never be as nice"
"1, 2, get ready"
"J-Hood"
"Never be as nice"
"This is how we do"
"Never be as nice"
"In the game playing for keeps"
"Get it popping"
"Never be as nice"

[Verse 2]
As the years went by, I grew and so did my vocab
Dumb young with like 60 rhymes in the notepad
All I need is a pen and a beat and I will mentally eat
Call me summer 'cause I deliver the heat
I got a dangerous mind like M. Pheif and Coolio
Light it up, get in the zone, and go in the studio
Bar for bar, I can't be touched
Want to crack off on me, you're better off cracking a dutch
Take real good glance, I'm hip-hop at it's finest
Right now, the industry's flooded with little vaginas
Rap version of Achilles, who gon' stop me?
Gon' take more than a bow and arrow to drop me
In the spot with more drugs than Eckerds
Niggas bootlegging on the east, niggas don't be selling no records
I'm 'bout to bring that New York look back
'Cause all these little garbage niggas be making New York look wack

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
I'm 'bout to fuck the game up like I scratched the disc
I'll break every bone in your body, starting with the wrist
I'm nicer than everybody that you got in your iPod
Try to find somebody better, you better try, God
Hizzle on the vocals, Premier on the track
Audio cocaine, all you're hearing is crack
Got the key to the city like they gave me the Nobel
For shaving hundred grizzies from a key with no scale
Clown rappers up, I knock them down like bowling pins
I'm starving and I know these niggas got ends
I'm the most lyrical nigga, just break down my wordplay
Or hit the streets with the pencil and take the serve day
Arrogant, but you can't fool me
Been nicest since it was cool to smack a nigga head after he got a baldy
Tales from the hood, money, read it and weep
My prediction is a hundred and fifty the first week

[Hook]
