[Smiley The Ghetto Child, intro]
Yeah, two thousand and fifteen
Still killing off rap these zombies and fiends
This is my site
Ground zero
And I'm legend

[Smiley The Ghetto Child, verse 1]
Behold the legend, just mastered the session
Go hard on a beat
Nickname: Erection
Direction
To the top, put it in perspective
The rap game's sick, it became infested
I am the professor, give you more for lesser
Here's where Preem definitely been a blessing
Suggestions?
And your facing the Wesson
I shove it down your throat like a ?cage of breathmints?
Elegant specimen
Ghetto benjamins
We get from the government but never loving it
Corrupt surcface
There is no purpose
I lay in wake so I correctly wrote this
Praying mamas
Fulling up the churches
?oping that their kids don't hit dirt, kid
Zombies around us, there is no trust
They don't want hip hop, they just... Want the bucks
I'm legend

[Smiley The Ghetto Child, verse 2]
Yo, we had the after dark, Kool Herc in the street parks
Flaming hearts
Was sparking the red Bronx
I kept my cypher fully loaded with fire
A legend at it's best, you can check my priors
Premier made the track
Gave me the mudwire
Said the liver
And take no prisoners
What is this?
You're living like Thanksgiving
Always taking but never giving
I'm a different kind of breed
A cure that people need
To kidnap hip hop, I'm ready to fucking bleed
I sold CD's
And system to make ends meet
No bowing on my knees, the agony of defeat
It wasn't part of my repertoire
I'm here to be a star
I keeps it raw
Like a plate of caviar
You want to kick it? You can't hang with us
You don't want hip hop, you just want the bucks
I'm legend

[Smiley The Ghetto Child, verse 3]
All the zombie homos
Caught in the ill zone all day like clown, fingerfucking their iPhone
They got no vision, they see the televison
Hardcore rapping ain't just guns and prison
Most of these niggas just be the witness
Passing up the great like moon in the distance
Let me give an example
Let me say for instance
Snitches get snitches after fame and riches
Just leave me alone
I'm just being consistent
Staying disciplined
Multiplying the digits
Preem never left, he gave room for the bitches
So we won't be subjected to the herbs on the record
The feelings all shown like seeing them naked
Mad and frustrated
They can't correct it
Hip hop in the trench is going to break the curse
They are not looking for the real, they just want the bucks
