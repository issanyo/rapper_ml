[Verse 1: THE-MIND-UNLEASHED]

“duck fam” what the fuck man
That sounds like a gay porn clan
And dont fuck my my clan or me
Because my minds unleashed
Knock out you god damn teeth
And whip you like Django
Cause im unchained
And your not properly trained for bee
Listen ducks, i done fucked your hens
And i can murder you with the power of simply using a pen
Me and GZA sitting and watching the whole duck fam
Burn up in a melting pot of liquid swords
Poison yall with some ricin
Knock you out like im mike Tyson
Enticing to see your blood decoratively spilled
Like Jason pollock paints
And watch your faint to the ill lyrical animal i am
And im artist see this is artistry like Shakespeare
Ill shake a spear in your artery
Its the crimnal minded part of me
I see you sweating
Well should of never been testing
Now you got paranoia running a 5K on your mind
NOW IMMA GO OFF MY MIND CUZ I AINT GOT NO TIME
So fuck your crew
This is true
Ill haunt you
Ya rhymes are just poo
Empty a clip of ammunition
On you whole crew
I got to damn hard
To damn soon
Im a baboon on the track
A guerrilla in you mother fucking coop
Fucking your hens
And then pulling up to the zoo
Im not controlled
Bitch i control you

[Verse 2: Blunderful]

Its rabbit season not duck season/
Watch bugs bunny he comes on top like a dutch treason/
I ain't even tryna eat fuck eatin/
Im tryna leave none to compete i give up leavin/
Catch a duck by the bill, gon be upheavin/
At the moment im cooking up a nice duck roast/
Rotisserie is my shit its the utmost/
Loveable lets take a toast/
And cremate this gross/
Feathered host/
No ghost, daffy got no soul/
Play it back slow mo/
Hack in its back/
No homo/
Collect more bills than any animal/
Only acknowledge a true mammal/
Feathered friends dont exist they just snakes in camo/
So is duck fam? hell no/

[Verse 3: boppet]

I’m known for lending mind-spurring verses for versus
So it’s certain that prove this assertion on purpose
Today some poor antinidae gonna get exposed and cut away
Not one-by-one per se, I’d rather shock em like a manta ray
And I’ll do it highly physical, for I’m strangely reciprocal
In my methods, and tactical raps add factual blasts to duck boys
You nothing but damp noise in room full of dildos and fuck toys
So bring something that I can never deliver
I’m cold, too bad ducks can't survive In the winter
And this all my hypothesis
Because yall the type to go the club and blow a kiss
Duck fam is nothing, man
I pack yall into a sedan and drop you off the edge of a dam
Damn, I kill you here to Kazakhstan, kill your plans
I’m happy for you though
Cause nobody can dodge like a duck can

[Verse 4: Chef, formerly known as RealChiefKeef]

It’s Chief, I’m a thief, steal your life
Fuck a gun man, I'll make do with a knife
I’m trife, love the strife
Some Nasty motherfucker getting killed tonight

I’m being honest, I hardly knew Nasty
He seemed cool, but then Flow asked me
If I wanted to lay down bars for a beef
I’m the Chief, my shots run deep
I’m a fucking criminal, fuck being subliminal
Crazy as fuck, but I’m still lyrical
Never pass the opportunity to feud
Fuck you Nasty, sorry for being rude
We the collective, you better respect it
Diss my crew, you can’t be protected
Normally I’m quite chill and peaceful
Set me off though, I turn fucking lethal
So fuck you, your crew, what you gonna do?
When we dead everybody, then it’s on to round two
Cause that’s my mindstate, there is no escape
The beef never dies it just escalates
Upvotes by the dozen, RG we runnin'
Run when we comin', say nothin'

[Verse 5: flowforpesos]

I’m done talking, uptown niggas be closing in
You bout to fuck with BK and your mouth will choke in sin
Let alone the heat, bars flaming the war and then
Y'all better be good at ducking slugs cuz I’m giving war to them
At the warden’s den, ain’t no jail bars to end this
Y'all better hope for my death cuz i be living wild like i was Ennis
Hustle be endless, pound cakes with the truffle
Just need 3 muscles to shoot, don’t make me do it, i’m not subtle
First it was @NastyEscobar1409 trying to get a reaction
Downvoting me all the time like some sort of fatal attraction
Get off my dick, you fried, don’t try to fuck with the god
But now I’m feeling like murking you and leaving your ass to sob
Racist wigga, the gloves are off, I’m coming for you and all the cacs
On your corny crew, and don’t make me go beyond wax
You don’t know me, Bedstuy native it’s do or die
And i don’t feel like going now so it’s action time
Why you trying to disrespect Nas, you better recognize
Change your name to “number one stan” and continue to dickride
When i bodied you, couldn’t take it, PM'ing like a bitch
Askingabout my homies that don’t fuck with you, try to get me to snitch
You’re cringeworthy, your entire crew is getting a lil too much wordy
When i start spitting, niggas get religious, gothic and too churchy
No mercy, skinny nigga but packing the gats I’m chunky
You from canada b, dunny, why you trying to fuck with me?
Your man @Guhsteh knows, you ain’t from Jane and Finch
You too Abercrombie and Fitch, you’re acting like a lil bitch
Shut the fuck up ‘fore you need to get some stitch fix
I’m a clumsy nigga, don’t let me spill and get messy with niggas' hissy fits
Your whole crew fucks with me, @GodAmongstKings upvoted my ether
(Now what that tell you?) You ain’t no fam, just a stan with eminem fever
@AtlienJ upvotes everything i post
So don’t act like you a part of the clique, you just a fucking ghost
Toast you with the roast, and I’m getting so close
To end your career once and for all, i don’t even know why you chose
Me, to be the nail in the coffin, the dangerous type of g
Got a lot of beef so logically, i pray on my foes
And for all you other chicks throwing shots on flow
You only get half a bar, fuck y'all hoes
