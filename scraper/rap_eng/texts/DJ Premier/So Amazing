[Verse 1]
Ayo, Scratch Magazine said the flow is untimely
Then they ask why haven't Eminem signed me
I ask myself the same question every day
When I'm sweatin', still baggin' up grams of boo-lay
Yo, Jay, you should really hit me up
'Cause I can go to the Roc or Roc La Familia
Bring that stock up
You could stock up
On a couple platinum plaques, I'll throw the Roc up
Just some shit I thought up, but it probably works
So hit me if you need some quality work
I'm the most underrated
Underestimated
Unsigned new cat to rap
See, I hit every label up
They said, "Damn, you could rhyme
You the best cat out we can't sign"
Well, that's fine, 'cause I'm a remember
Each and every one of y'all faces when I make it
Preme

[Verse 2]
Ayo, who you know nicer than Term, riddle me this
If you don't say Rakim, you better say 'Kiss
Styles P, Kool G or Pac
Anybody else, I put 'em up in a box
They say lyrically, I'm the new AZ
'Cause if I really wanted to I could keep up with Nas
Term is like Earth, Wind & Fire, rims and tires
But you can't ask people, they biased
I'm the flyest sire of this side of Elmira
I'll walk past papayas and into the fire
I'm, chillin' with Mya, crushin' Mariah
While I'm fuckin' with Tyra, you fuckin' Elvira
I got Latino respect like Carlito
Since way back with Stretch and Bobbito
I'm in the lab, it's just me and Primo
The ghost of James Brown and the soul of Chris Rios

[Verse 3]
Puff hear this, take a meeting the next day
I won't say shit, I'll just tell them to Press Play
Yo, Dre, you should hit me with some beats
I'll write the whole Detox in one week
The sun rises in the East but it sets in the West
So I ain't got an 'S' on my chest
I'm the best new artist out that's on the market
Who you think your girl filling up her iPod with?
You give me a mil? I'll turn into 50
Watch me diss every muh'fucker who ever dissed me
My kicks is crispy, sippin' on a Formula 50
Bitches sayin' when I'm tourin', they miss me
I'm so Ludacris, I could be DTP
Get it crunk like TVT
These A&R's hear me, they gon' lose it
Man, it's just Common Sense, it's G.O.O.D. Music
