[Hook: Cee-Lo]
I think I love her, matter of fact I know it y'all
And I'm taking chances and I know this
But I desire her she is wonderful
She is the reason that I wrote this
Holding the pieces of my broken heart
And I can't help it, I'm hopeless
Yes I need her she inspires me
She is the reason that I wrote this

[Wais]
This world is cold you make me warm
I'm in love with your mind, your shape, your form
I spend every last dime til my cake is gone
Just to keep you in minks, bags, Louis Vitton
Feminine Gucci Gooses, I bought it from boosters
You love my style cause I'm not what you're used to
I'm not what you seen I keep the Navi on lean
Champagne in the trunk on top of the pump
You got me mesmerized by your legs and thighs
I don't do nothing sweet they call me rough sex-wise
Thug sex Wais, your boy's a beast
Punish you all night til I curl your feet
Plus I like how you grind in time with the beat
Gangster love, I drive, you carry the heat
Anybody violate they get badly beat
No ring but the hood know you married to me

[Hook]

[Half Dead]
I just want to take this time out to honor ya
You gave birth to my children Hakana yeah I owe you the world
God gave you to me, you more than my girl
And you handles your business I'm oh so proud of ya
Between school and you working hard
I know the kids is a full-time job
But I'm trapped in the stu, and I'm rapping for you
Cos if it happens for me then it happens for you
I already priced the house
And them worthless bitches in my life is out
I'm trying to teach Nine Asia what life about
I'm trying to raise her and Nia
Live old enough to see 'em bring forth they own seed one day
One day I'mma make it up to you for that foul shit I did
I was wrong it meant enough to say
To say I can't swallow my pride and expose my inside, baby

[Hook]
