Yeah
Premier and Slick Rick kid
Jonah Hill
Yeah kid, check it out

[Hook]
Good gosh the world's so bad
It's trying to drive me, a sane man, mad
Great gosh I needs some bad
'bout to drive me, a sane man, mad
(Kick it Rick)

[Slick Rick]
Are you peeping this floosie
Or queens, eh excuse me
Can't believe how many times I had to eat the chick's sushi
Who she?
Look at how a brother gotta roll
All cold, kid
Anyway truth being told
Fit boy too, big
Which one you pick
Rico suave or chick one, two kid
Once I was born in this thick
Why I gotta deal with this horniness tip
This, not enough flair
This, lack lot wares
Got her holding my tears, trying to act like who cares

Reaching, if I say I see kids in the mix
Wanna cuddle, go out something, trick with the chick

Motivate through it though I know it ain't true
Why argue, tell a chick "You're okay too"
Delilah
Though I flirt too beside her
Easy to play dumb while your IQ is higher
Why ya, you treat me like a sucker
I don't know should I keep maneuvering Tanaka?
To what, something sexual, puppy
Anything to get into this shallow chick's body

(Know what I'm saying kid)
Cause it bad, trying to drive me a sane man mad
(Say what my kid)
I needs some bad about to drive me a sane man mad
(Bring it on kid)
Good Gosh the world so bad, trying to drive me, a sane man, mad
(Bring me home kid)
Great Gosh need some bad, about to drive me a sane man...

I want you, munch too, comes to hun, how long do
Ma duke caught the kid masturbating once too
(no)
Passed, looked stunned, kept on like
Don't you have a steady piece to smash yet son?
What to do Mom, none touching dude's joint
Like to see me out here buying some prostitute's bum?
No?
Picking up scroin, cop pursuing
From the stripper club hairdoing
Then laughed and none but wise after
Soulmate, more than sex, a live partner

Snatch can't get, cat frantic
So, in the meantime stripper club, lap dance tip
A professional press box arouser
Some condoms so I don't mess up me trousers
Then start paying, mark swaying
Girlfriend just sit down and start playing
Here's an extra, parading the wealth
Don't want a real kid feel like I'm degrading myself
Bouncing on me funny, bouncing with my money
Or its back to playing cat and mouse games with the honey

(You know what I mean kid)
Caught a script so bad, trying to drive me, a sane man, mad
(Say what Slick Rick)
I need some bad 'bout to drive me, a sane man, mad
(Premier)
Good gosh the world so bad trying to drive me, a sane man, mad
(Jonah Hill kid)
Good gosh, need some bad, about to drive me a sane man...

I need some bad X 4
