[Intro]
I hear voices.. Damn
Word? Shit!
You buggin' my nigga I don't hear nothin, for real!
Damn.. Shit is crazy
Gotta stop fuckin' drinkin' that henny
Smokin' that weed
(Uh!)

[Verse 1]
I hear voices, and it sounds like Pac
Askin' me, yo what's up with Hip Hop?
All these niggas, tryin' to live thug life
They didn't listen when I was spittin' on the mic
All they heard was Makaveli the great
They didn't hear when I was comin' in a positive way
Like Keep Ya Head Up, and Brenda With a Baby
Niggas just love to think that I was crazy
But I was crazy smart
My momma ain't raised no fool
I spit from the heart
Black Panther shit, mixed with street poetry
I had to hit
Aiyyo Poet
All these niggas is ass
If I was alive today I would straight spas

[Hook]
Damn! I hear voices in my head
Niggas that's live, niggas that's dead
Damn! I'm hearin voices
Gotta stop drinkin that Henny
I know that shit's poison
Damn! I'm hearin voices in my head
Niggas that's live, niggas that's dead

[Verse 2]
I hear voices, and it sounds like Biggie
Askin' me, what up with New York City?
Why y'all niggas ain't puttin' up big numbers?
African niggas, bootleggin' every summer
Yo what the fuck?! Y'all better get at them
If y'all niggas tryin' to go gold and platinum
You better start flippin' over them tables
Like a nigga on the street, and they tryin' to play you
But I know the game, everybody gotta eat
I respect the hustle, look how Diddy doin' me
Looks like y'all niggas gotta go harder
And FYI, I'm pissed at Shawn Carter

[Hook]
Damn! I hear voices
Gotta stop drinkin' that henny
I know that shit's poison
Damn! I'm hearin' voices in my head
Niggas that's live, niggas that's dead
Damn! I hear voices
Gotta stop drinkin' that henny
I know that shit's poison!
Damn! I hear voices in my head
Niggas that's live, niggas that's dead

[Verse 3]
I hear voices, and it sounds like the God
Rakim Allah, live Central Park
Thun, you gotta make 'em follow the leader
When the rhythm hit 'em in the ghetto then they gon' see ya
Voices.. And it sounds like Eazy-E
Tellin' me, these niggas is pussy, he's a G
Arguin' about St. Ides and O.E
Talkin' about, how Dr. Dre owe me
I hear voices.. And it sounds like Big Pun
Tellin' me, it's so hard to be the one
Voices, goin' through my head every day
I hear Run, talkin' to D about J
I hear voices, when I smoke that chronic
Big L got niggas hooked on ebonics
Damn! What the fuck I gotta do?
I just heard Dirty screamin' "Brooklyn Zoo!"

[Hook]
Damn! I hear voices in my head
Niggas that's live, niggas that's dead
Damn! I hear voices
Gotta stop drinkin' that henny
I know that shit's poison!
Damn! I hear voices in my head
Niggas that's live, niggas that's dead
Damn! I hear voices
Gotta stop drinkin' that henny
I know that shit's poison!

[Outro]
God! Jesus.. It's crazy!
Ya know'm sayin'?
I got Slick Rick hollerin' at me in my head
Grand Puba in my head
Motherfuckin Treacherous Three
They all in my head.. like.. bangin' in my head
Like Kool Moe Dee.. Screamin' at me
T La Rock, Cold Crush
It's crazy! Shit's crazy!
All the Hip Hop Gods
Niggas that's live niggas that's dead
Help me!
