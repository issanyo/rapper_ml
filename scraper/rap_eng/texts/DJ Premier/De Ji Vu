Yo, it's the De, Ji, Vu... underestimated
I'm coming blessed with hatred and those feelings numbed, but never faded
A fuckin reprobate, an outcast, come get a taste
I'm crushin featherweights with heavy rhymes that often levitate

I never soften, get it straight. Think you hot, then set a date
Ill leave you stomped by stompin you with just two bars, I never waste
Time. Around the clock I never stop to get a break
The sound I rock is bound to shock and to my pops, I dedicate

I meditate in clever ways, embellishing ma breath with haze
With relish to mellow me through many un-zealous hellish days
And if I keep writing, I might even get a raise
Heh... yeh right. I ain't even getting paid

I yell rhymes, I never serenade
My mindstate is very scary, so you best stay wary of my deadly ways
When MC's ask to battle, I just tell 'em "nay"
Cause while I mastered the class of rap, you got left back in second grade

I'm weapons grade plutonium, you pepper spray
I'm the new, you decayed. That whack ass fool from yesterday
You might as well confess you're gay, you can't hide it
And I can't suggest a way. Stop livin sexually repressed, ok?

I'm blessed in ways you couldn't understand
Flows potent like a hundred grams of coke, pure Columbian
The son of sam couldn't tell more gory stories
With such rawness and purity I remain the most wanted man

I'm pumping jams with flavour, don't fuck with nothing bland
Brittle names like "Little Wayne", Im crushin in my fuckin hand
You tryna front without a foot to stand on
Better flush that tampon and don't come back til you a fuckin man

I'm huffin and puffin and trust, I ain't just bluffin man
Your good for nothing ass should just give up, join a percussion band
I bust this with such roughness. Got it sussed, its in the fuckin can
Its DeJi Vu, fool, better remember who the fuck I am


Yo its the De Ji Vu!
Who, who, who, who, who?

Its the De Ji Vu!
Who, who, who, who, who?

Its the De Ji Vu!
Who, who, who, who, who?

Its the De Ji Vu...
