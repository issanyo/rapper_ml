Get the king out his seat
And make way for the beast
Soon you'll realize why they named this coast after me
I rap grimy and timely like the Pros and the Bigs
The Childish, Nitrose slash God's Kid
No one in Hell can stop this kid
Sent on Earth equipped to do God's bid
Rap game's been fastin' and I ate the last fig

This cat named Nick ripped the script, not a bit shook
By the quick pot of shit Momma said 'ould cook
Brooklyn not where I'm from but when I'm done
Y'all be thinkin' that I used to share a bathroom with Satan
Yea there's a lot of shit to deal with
First I'm shorter than everybody who's hearing
This beat in a dark cellar where I'm a dweller emotionally
Writing rhymes in rough times, spittin' till my lips get lines
Art comes from pain so when you babblin' bout fast crimes
In your fine Maybach remind yourself
What you spittin' and rhyme or reason
Only thing protecting you is blubber from the cold rap season

Unlike rappers
I actually enunciate words and verbs
So you can discern the world I picture in the verse
Hardly curse, unless it's necessary;
Slackers deem it a necessity - give'em less syllables to carry
Not to mention the 'N' word which gives Whites a disadvantage
Cuz you can't manage a sentence like, "guys be trippin' and actin' savage;
Villain get off me; you speakin' candid"
I guess I'll have to repackage my emotional bagage

Life is always good and I am always in trouble
Blacks score a triple-double from the rubble
Never fumble or tell jokes subtle
Feed off opportunity instead of crumbling down the fatal funnel
The sun will come out tomorrow
If you're faithful
God leaves the key on the table;
Best be grateful
Like a rose, I arose from the grave
Came a long way from playing ball on a paved plain
Now I'm hear to stay - Derrick Rose did the same
Not to be vain - my name is my name

Started before Hove and Steez on this beat
Cuz I embodied it with the most courtesy to the leading jockey
Don't be deceived
Hove finishes 3rd in this rap heat
His chorus and repetition put him in a position for defeat
Ain't seekin' battles but I think I could contend
Until I'm content with contemporary rap this isn't The End
