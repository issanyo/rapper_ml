[Hook]
Niggas trying to play you out, thun, let the guns blow
Niggas trying to say you can't live, let the guns blow
Niggas trying to play you out, son, let the guns blow
Niggas saying you can't eat, let the guns blow
Trying to play you out, son, let the guns blow
They trying to play you out, nigga, let the guns blow
They trying to play you out, son, let the guns blow
They trynna play you, nigga

[Verse 1]
Ay yo, fuck that, violate, pay with your life
Nigga play you once, then they're bound to play you twice
And when one nigga do it, then another nigga do it
Now the hood know you pussy, your thugging is a wrap
Might as well grab the gat, nigga, and let the guns blow
Turn into Superthug, let them motherfuckers know
I'd rather get caught with it than without it
Police can get it too, put them dicks in critical
I'm taking every penny, I'm drinking plenty Henny
I know you hear me, New York City, let them guns blow
For Big Poppa, Big Pun, and Big L, yo
For Freaky Tah and Jam Master, oh hell no
We got to regulate, we got to set it straight
Ya niggas keep acting like pussy, I take the whole plate
Oh you don't know how this shit do
It's me, Blaq Po', I let them guns blow

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Now when I say let them motherfuckers go, I mean it
Let off some shots from Compton to Queensbridge
I got Pops dusting off his old shotty
Granny running 'round saying "bitch, I'll catch a body"
Look at little nigga with his hair all naughty
Fucking with them big guns, no steel, snotty
Im'ma be the reason why niggas be wilding
Little Rock, Chi Town, Detroit, wilding
You got that 4 pound, let off a few rounds
You bought the motherfucker, what you gon' do now
Just lick it in the air, you thug, you don't care
I thought you was never scared, fuck out of here
Pass it off to a nigga that bust it
Nigga that love it, nigga that don't discuss it
Get high, get drunk, get loose tonight
Whoever you don't like get murdered on sight
One, two, three, throw them guns in the air
You get knocked, remember that...

"I don't care"

Let the guns blow
