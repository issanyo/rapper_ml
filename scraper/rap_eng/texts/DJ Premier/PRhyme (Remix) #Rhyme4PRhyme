Verse 1:
Before my birth, I was destined to be a prima donna
Back when bitches used to still act Like A Virgin, pre-Madonna
Alan Z, there's a diva for ya, bet on me to fail I'ma leave you poorer
Scope a chick and then I R.I.P. her box
Soon as I read her aura (Rita Ora)
I bring light that penetrates energy vampires used to drama
My mind's in the year 3000 like Andre mixed with Futurama
Hoes don't care about your true persona
Long as she got a new purse on her
Ironic that I had to escape Seattle to pursue Nirvana
Am I the one that Courtney Love or another Kurt Cobain?
Tryna be big and white like Childish Gambino and be worth cocaine
Instead of having to serve no-name bigots I have to face
Cuz I have a face
That's neither black or white, some can't get past my race
Even tho I'm Masta Ace at a faster pace, and vocally matching Trey
And Breezy before he could catch a case
Exclusive to the music, but it's like I'm in a rabbit race
As a ninja turtle, getting outlapped at a rapid rate
But I win in the end, so I guess it depends
If I see it as a gift or a curse that I have the last laugh to date
Victory has a bittersweet aftertaste
But I crave the fruits of my labor
Like the birth of a new you, with the fame, chick magnet
When they see you with the vapors
I can freak any style
Freak any girl like Keni Styles, compare me to him
Asiatic but I'm on a pornographic baller status, Ron Jeremy Lin

Chorus
I give my all, trade it all to be famous
It's all I want, it's all I need
Don't care bout nothing just gotta be famous
It's all I want, it's all I need (yeah)

Verse 2
Before I even cross over, they crucify me
But my situation is do or die
And by that I mean either I make it or I commit suicide, now choose a side
Prosper or you can offer
Your 2 cents that ain't worth a dime like an easy thot
Give a penny for your thoughts
But you wouldn't make a dollar
In the 4th quarter if your CD dropped
I care about your opinion as much I care about abstinence...
I don't give a fuck!
I'll be fucking the souls out of hoes til I die
When they die, I'ma fuck their spirits up!
So give it up! If you're telling me to be realistic
All you little bitches can swallow my pride
And I'm proud of my D
I can stroke the emotions out of a chick that she kept bottled inside
The road to success is like a fraternity hazing til you break through
And only gets worse when you debut
But brings you relevance in case you
Wanna quit, but fame's an addiction
A codependency that takes two
It's a sad, sadistic masochistic bond that makes or breaks you
Fame is an illusion, a mist that you can fool women with
Trying to tap into my higher being
Dreaming til I make what's lucid exist
While religious nuts scrutinize music trying to see if Lucifer spits
I'm sacrificing my inner demons per record to make a lucrative flip
All around the world, rocking shows
Getting that melting pot of gold
I'ma leave behind a legacy of sex, drugs, rock and roll
Til models swing on each other over me and compete for attention
I'm swimming in women
I love the American Dream with a vengeance

Chorus
