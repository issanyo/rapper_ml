(Verse)
She said is this really you, this really what you do?
I said, nah, i just got a microphone inside my home
And lip sync the dope lyrics that you hearin’
So you think that I can rap, and consequently
That would make me look cool?
Haha, nah, I haven’t been developin’ since middle school
To feel the rain from the cloud of doubt that you bringin’ through
I just hear the beat and fuckin’ jump in like swimmin’ pool
Cut in like interlude, this just in like interview
Damn
I Willy Wonka roll into the recording booth
Stoop Kid chillin’ at the stoop, I’m the morning news
I been chewin’ up the alphabet like it’s my bowl of soup
Man, I deserve a trophy wife and she deserves a photoshoot
Homie, I’m the sickest, I’ve been doublin’ my doses
You ain’t immune to it, you got multiple sclerosis
My gun is fully loaded if you wanna get me goin’
And my name is still Generic if you wonderin’ who wrote it
Still the same kid, just a different location
Here comes another tape, yeah, that shit is still bakin’
You open up the oven, put that disc in rotation
This shit’s an invite to come and chill at my station
Welcome back
