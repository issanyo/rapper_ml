[Intro: Kidd Loki]
Its KL
F.Y.C. squad

[Verse 1:Kidd Loki
Ain't no discussion i'm soon to be king of this rap shit
The young Mac spittin' classics
Tell the haters hold my baggage
This gone feel like a nine piece to yo' dome
Or nine niggas that's nine pieces to yo' home
I'm feelin like a badass, shoutout to Joey though
So i'ma have to spit that unorthodox flow
I'm as hot as yah' grandpa flippin' coke units
Then goin' stupid and throwing up the wrong gang deuces
But the flow stupid, prophet at the truest
You fuckin' wit' the coolest
Uh, The heat i'm gettin' to it
The new school novelist
Akron my metropolis
Just know for my opposites, I'll still bomb this shit
Burn the building to the ground and shit, and ya'll the occupants
The hottest nig', undeniably the best rockin wit'
Been fightin' wit' the dragons, can't tell me i'm not hot
You niggas ain't above average, shit at least not in my eyes
You tryna see my level?
Just know you'll never climb, I excel every line that's dealt
Wit' my fuckin' mind
But shit, how can you resist a mastermind?
2017 now, 2016 thanks for the ride
(bla- BLAH)

Niggas don't respect the grind and hate on work
Actin' like you ain't never did no dirt
Nigga look at me and tell me what the fuck you worth
Is you gonna put your life or the music first?


[Verse 2: Kidd Loki]
I keep the music poppin', like y'all be poppin' them perks
Keep the burn on yo hip, or they gone lay you in a hearse
Tell me that my words is heard, and y'all not deaf
Tell me the day a young nigga follow in my steps, i must confess
I'm a victim of the world you thought less
We cautious
Tell me the truth if i fall off
But for now i got my guns drawn
And puttin' shots in this beat like a sawed off
My mind's infamous striving to be limitless
Come dwell with the sickest kids
I flick the Bic, then its lit in this Bic, for this rap shit
No caption
X-rated, general masses, yeah the flow classic
(laughs)
Lays on the beat, took my mind off the streets
Stayed cool in the heat, then got stuck on repeat
And i'll be damned if me and my niggas don't eat , because
Life ain't free
But strive for anything
(bla- BLAH)
