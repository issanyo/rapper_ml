[Intro: Stush]
Ight, KidStush up in this one
Boutta spit on that old school shit
Brooklyn!
Just doing what I do
Spittin! Ain't nothing new

[Verse 1: Stush]
Now Imma say it all in laymens, you can never tame this
Tryna head over to caymans, people saying that I'm famous
Lemme tell you what the shame is, they don't even know the name is
KidkedSoStush, the nigguh that is the greatest
These rappers are the lamest, I can say that I'm not having it
I'm laughing with my savage shit and they dont know the half of it
I spit that heat, if nigguh beef, I son em put a calf in it
With luniz on repeat and my 16, the fucking alphabet
Immaculate, it's overhead
The kid is like a loaf of bread
He's gonna feed the poor, for the seed to grow, he gon need some mo
Dough to make it happen, for this rappin gotta do some yappin
Continue with the writing, shocking nigguhs with the lightning
Flow so electric, especially in this rap shit
A specialist, up next bitch, on your fucking guess list
You guessed it, the shame is they don't even know the name is
KidkedSoStush, just know he gonna wreck this

[Verse 2: Stush]
So I guess I gotta do it again, slick with the pen
Ain't another nigguh truer than him, he's gonna win
So fresh, you ain't newer than him, so tell me when
Are you nigguhs gonna do it like him, guess never then
Never begging for a handout, ain't my style, I ain't no pauper
Grace you with my presence, that depends where is my offer
If it ain't about the money than my dick you can jump off of
You the homie then what's poppin, if you ain't where is the dollars
Loyalty til royalty, the motto that I bleed
Tryna spread it to the people, gonna teach it to my seed
Elevate yourself, I ain't talking with the trees
But if you lighting up that blunt then pass that shit to me
Like I'm Usher let it burn, If imma teach you gonna learn
Nigguhs writing and they try, I'm the best, I'm not concerned
And I heard! The shame is you don't even know the name is
KidkedSoStush and I'm just waiting for my turn
