[Verse 1: Logic]
Various women I'm swimming in like a shark
Hold up, that was the first one, let me run it back and restart
Young Sinatra ripping the beat apart
Shining like a diamond when I be rhyming
But y'all in the dark
On point like a poisonous dart
I can feel it now, the fame is coming soon
How can sky be the limit when there's footprints on the moon?
Now, I used to bus tables now I bust rhymes
Spitting lines to the illest of dimes
Just to pass the time
Living like a Don, mafietic mind state
Hip-Hop heads never die, we multiply then dominate
Now I been flowing since a adolescent up until the present
Rehearsing flows for various shows
Yeah that's how I roll
Getting respect and never neglect
That as I infect, they detect it, and when I dissect
Rip it and wreck it now
Thats on the record
As the vinyl spin so slowly
Bringing verses like a Holy...
Bible, my flow is tribal
Meet me in the street homie I'm liable
To get it right then and there
Motherfuckers like where...
He come from?
Got music for days and then some
They were stepping confident until I made 'em run
You know it's Logic
In your vacinity murder evil entities
Better known as your enemies
You feel it now
Spark the L and you be coolin'
Chillin' relaxin' to this audio satisfaction
I leave MC's missin' in action, leave you gashin
From a thousand lashes
Why I'm laughing with a passion
Standing over you smiling til I hear sirens then I'm dashing

[Hook: AZ & *Nas*]
Life's a bitch and then you die
*That buck that bought the bottle
Coulda struck the lotto*
Life's a bitch and then you die
*Got rhymes 365 days annual plus some*

[Verse 2: Logic]
This second verse is dedicated to rappers that never made it
Cause they gave up on their dream
In other words they hesitated to take it
But I swear I'mma make it better than ever before
Cause half of y'all don't even know
See I be rolling through the streets
In a beamer bomber like Hiroshima
Gonna hit you like Katrina until they like "Damn Gina!"
I eat MCs like fast food
Hella rude
I'm the reason that your favorite rapper's in a bad mood
My name is Logic
I was born in 1990
Ain't no need to remind me
That when you listen you wanna rewind me
All the labels wanna sign me
For the right reason
We aim to please
Hunting dollars and it's buck season
Cuz

[Outro: AZ]
Life's a bitch and then you die
That's why we get high
Cause you never know when you're gonna go
Life's a bitch and then you die
Thats why we puff lye
Cause you never know when you're gonna go
Life's a bitch and then you die
That's why we get high
Cause you never know when you're gonna go
Life's a bitch and then you die
