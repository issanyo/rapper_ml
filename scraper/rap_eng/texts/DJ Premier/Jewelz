[Intro]
Uh, uh, yeah, yeah, ha
Come on, come on, come on, ha
What, yeah
Diggin In The Crates y'all
Come on, come on, come on
Uh, yeah
Lord Finesse y'all
Check it, yeah
Uh, check it out
Check it out

[Verse 1]
Yo, my movement motion
Smooth or rough as the ocean
Sometimes it slip away and I lose devotion
My judgement get cloudy, then I wanna get rowdy
Like a mania, terrorize like Saudi Arabia
My avions reflects my mood swing
Switch colors like a mood ring
Wifey telling me good things
So I won't strain
Got grey hairs, and only been here 25 years
Shed tears for niggas I knew for life, now lifeless
When you died, to us, was like the Iranian crisis
I took it hard like a flick of slow mo' breathing
Prophetize dot of a book A Midsummer Night's Dreaming
Semi-wet as I write this, dragging a cancer stick
Smoke thick, Hennessy shots to my wig
Half-naked while I jot this, lounging in my boxers
Dreaming Tahiti, even settle for the Bahamas
I get a boner when I'm asleep
Dreaming that I'm lounging on a yacht
(Chill in the sun) boat 'bout the leave the docks
Reality I wake up to
Feels like I woke up to a cloud filled room with angel dust
It's just the...

[Chorus]
Stress, frust', make me wanna bust
Make me wanna cuss
I lust, for living a life a righteousness
With invisible forces stand in my way, keeping my mind off course

[Verse 2]
I'm searching for the light like Noah
The flame combust
Upon the bush forseeing my future like the Nova
Pushing for the brighter side of living a life
A better time pouring rhymes like wine
'Til my cup run it over
Temptation on my shoulder
I'm growing colder than a polar bear
Thinking about a bank hold up
I fall upon my lap, and rest my head upon my knee caps
Is it a crime that I be dreaming about the G's, black?
Freeze for a minute, gotta take control of my life
Gotta hold it like a knife
Must have more than a slice, you know
Frustration, mental masturbation (confusion)
Life is love, living 'til I'm right, be in a illusion
Seclusion, seeing me is rare
I rather attain stacks, mack the islands on a plane ready for lift off
And spend grands, sipping exotic juice
Laying in the shade in shorts, at a fly resort
On my cell, contact the D.I.T.C. cohorts
Talking to the god Finesse
We tight like Indians with a mohawk
And so on
Conversation going on, do the math
Dreaming I leave the sand for champagne bubble bath
Reality I wake up to
Feels like I woke up to a cloud filled room with angel dust
It's just the...

[Chorus]
Stress, frust', make me wanna bust
Make me wanna cuss
I lust, for living a life a righteousness
With invisible forces stand in my way, keeping my mind off course
Stress, frust', make me wanna bust
Make me wanna cuss
I lust, for living a life a righteousness
With invisible forces stand in my way, keeping my mind off course

[Verse 3]
(You're working hard for the dough) But time seem to go slow
Busting your ass to go from an amateur to a pro
Low budget feeling inside, no more can you score
Bad and the good fighting inside just like a war
Slavery, later foundation for my nation centuries before
Final Call will be the New World Order
2 K's on it's way, no time for play
So I pray to God got me on a path of righteous ways
Even though I get stressed, and frustrated
The best time for me to bless a rhyme is to put the pen through a test
Yeah, I want the riches, the missus on my side
Own a pool with the night when it blizzard
And work magic like a grand wizard
Official O.C., a two syllable sound
Three-six-zero incomplete like the Earth was round
And on that note keep hope alive
Striving to rise from the inner soul
Seeing through the eyes of a crow, you know
Slow pacing walk forth is only right
Separate the cause from another man "Far From Yours"
Going for mine still coming off a two-year hiatus
And in that time niggas bit my shit like alligators
It's alright, though, this rap shit is stress for us
It makes youu feel like you're in a hallway robust with angel dust
Reality I wake up to
My old dad once told me how you live your life is all on you, son

[Chorus]
Stress, frust', make me wanna bust
Make me wanna cuss
I lust, for living a life a righteousness
With invisible forces stand in my way, keeping my mind off course
Stress, frust', make me wanna bust
Make me wanna cuss
I lust, for living a life a righteousness
With invisible forces stand in my way, keeping my mind off course
