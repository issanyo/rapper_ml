[Verse 1]
The system's broken, the gates open so you can enter
I won't destroy your life, I'm the only alive inventor
Your life already got broken, go to the help center
I'm not attacking you, I'm the only alive defender
And my bars become shorter again and again
I hope you haven't noticed that - it wasn't part of the plan
And I'ma do everything for ya, if you say you my fan
I'ma teach how to hadle AK, it's Kazakhstan!
There's the war going on outside, like 90's
But they fought with the guns, smoked the family trees
Now we fight with the rhymes, I can tell it looks harder
You dunking like Davis, I shot 3-point like James Harden
Went through beat like Curry and that's the way smarter
That armor will never help you, I'm the only alive problem
You have still to decide, it ain't real when I'm on the mic
So you have a chance to choose when and where we gon' collide
The nation be splitted: on red and blue on black and white
Say something if you agree, I wanna hear you replie
Ok, I see you are scaried, at least I have tried
I am the only alive rapper who will never lie

[Verse 2]
I ain't did too much yet to start regreting that shit
I still got the loads things to learn and lot of things to commit
My moves are pretty fast, so I will never finish last
I was bulding the houses when you was happy breaking glass
I answer the questions even if you forgot to ask
And all of my answers could be found in SoundCloud
Inspire me one time and I make place overcrowded
No matter who, where, when and what you are
I trust you mister special , you the only alive star
And it be really pleasant If you would trust me too
Like Timbucktu believed in Derrick Rose and his red crew
From Chi-town, I'm going up and I'm down
While I'm putting the sneakers on, please wear me the crown
I'm from another city, from another part of the world
Unlike my peers from a college I have not lost control
Come on, laugh at me, you the only alive troll
They enrolled you like a monkey with a banana
You think you real hard gangsta wearing bandana
You on streets with a gun like Tony Montana 
I was at home, drinking tea in front of piano
So just make the right conclusions, man, don't stay in the middle
And I hope one day you be the only alive leader
