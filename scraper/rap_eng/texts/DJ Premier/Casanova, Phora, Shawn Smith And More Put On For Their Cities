[Verse 1: Flawless Real Talk]
I can't believe that I'm here, no I actually can't
They asked for me by name, that's what I call demand
I told people all year that this is part of the plan
Aw yeah, the world's about to find out who I am
My name if Flawless Real Talk, my music always stand forever
These new rappers don't respect it, I demand the pressure
One on the drums, one on the keys, one could play whatever
Oh you don't get it? I'm just tryin' to band 'em all together
Slide through, they spin it like fast food 'cause mind you
They come, get a mil and they gone, it's like a drive thru
First I had to wait for my plate, well now it's time to
Spit a flow the spirit of Biggie gon' come alive to, wait
I couldn't break, I was breakin' down every door
Flaw never settle like 'cept when I settle scores
Shouldn't have a problem losin' a crown that was never yours
I'm Steph nice, you takin' a shot, then you better score
Success is down the road, death is around the corner
God is walkin' with me, the Devil's offerin' water
Was gonna call it quits but the pay phone was out of order
Before I was diagnosed with an instrumental disorder
I am not waitin', spot taken, their hearts shakin'
And it should be if they get in the way of what I'm chasin'
My music play all over the world, stop hatin'
Over 61 countries, tell Jay I rock nations

[Verse 2: Casanova]
You in the club like shoo shoo
I don't know no fuckin' dance moves
I see a op I'm like shoot shoot
That's how me and my gang move
Walk the top, I told him to fuck a op
Niggas talkin' dirty I clean 'em up with the mop
I was doin' burpees, stressed out in a box
Waitin' for a search, tryin' to hide the [?]
Fresh home, I need a starter kit
So I robbed the motherfuckers I was robbin' with
Damn, I'm a greaseball
Your man on the stand, nigga cheeseball
Yeah, he a known rat
And just 'cause he rat, you condone that
Put in work, I'ma own that
Word to 2 time, I ain't goin' back

[Verse 3: Shawn Smith]
We could talk but just be cautious, I been longin' to snap
But regardless, I'm the hardest, other artists is wack
And chief told me tell these hittas, ain't no arguin' back
Spongebob, I got a slug that'll talk to you cats
I ain't talkin' 'bout the KKK, but I know the point of the hood
Is to show us the ropes, eventually we'll have to hang together
I need some change or something
I'm sorta like a wet dream, boy I came from nothing
And my father was the type to get snorted out just to slang
It was more than clout, it was orbit, you get cornered out if you sang
And the law was given orders [?] would hang
So I feel like gold dust, boy I'm goin' out with a bang
And I'ma bring the savage back if cats adapt to new figures
I'm humble like rap adapt, no matter fact, I'm the biggest
Ladder pap, ratatat, cataracts with the trigger
The mind spray, Kanye, the MAGA hat with you niggas
All my homies baggin' rocks, it's no mo' time for baggin' thots
I'd rather guap, time's gettin' [?] but we ain't had a lot
It's at your stage where they step on birds like Travis Scott
And we just really need a voice, every day the streets exploit
Thinkin' 'cause you got a couple dollars, you don't need a joint
They put a semi to your colon just to show you that your
Commas is beneath the point, you better make a decent choice
Hittas gettin' minimized, they don't know what they symbolize
Actin' civilized gets you criticized, they don't sympathize
Much as when you flip the pies, I could really visualize
My hittas havin' bigger ties, 'bout to hit my business guys
And start me up a enterprise, Young Buck chain from G-Unit
I'm spendin' wise, ho
Thank God I ain't never been tested
Never been a lame nigga, never been arrested
I never had scoliosis, that's just a blessing
That just mean my backbone ain't never been a question
We embark on this patio, it's actually fate
And the heat [?] lasts as snakes
So like Leonardo DiCaprio, our gats be great, Philly

[Verse 4: Phora]
It's disappointing seein' my favorite rappers fall knowin' they was tight
Any move you make, just know I done twice
I'm the type to bring a fuckin' army to a gun fight
My shit hit like a 4-5 and I ain't talking Russ height
Miniature amateur rappers, I'm in your face
I'm with the lions and the tigers, all you hoes could get a taste
I give you two more years, you'll be replaced
By another rapper with dreads and tats on they face
They all the same, fuck it, they know the name, fuck it
They say I changed but I'm switchin' lanes in the same bucket
Someone go tell Akademiks he a bitch
And someone go tell Lil Xan, yo his stylist could get this dick, wait
Rap game is like a circus filled with pests
But if you left it up to me, shit I would trade 'em all for X
But don't lil' bro me when I inspired you
When you flop, come to yours truly, maybe we'll hire you, bitch

[Verse 5: REASON]
Look I'll set it off, like Cleo, cape flappin' I'm rap's hero
This rap's Debo, I'm snatchin' off all chains
Real spittin' is back, look how the time changed
Now it's two kings in LA since 'Bron came
I'm from the bottom, you name it, I prolly did it
I'm ridin' with a chick, body thicker than Kylie Jenner
You're sayin' life's a bitch, I spot her I'll prolly get her
Slid in the DMs quicker than Gotti did it
Then I cruised in it, feel like it's a pool in it
I got a hook like teacups and spoons spinnin'
I see a lot of rappers with spots I'm soon gettin'
Game crowded, they gon' have to make room in it
They tell me I sound like Cole, sound like Kendrick
Sound like Wayne, sound like Quik every time I'm spittin'
How I sound like all these niggas but they sound so different
Well fuck it, if I sound like 'em then I sound like winners, that's real
It's Jay Z in the makin', that's what I'm 'bout, nigga
So tell Hov that REASON able to doubt niggas
Not dissin', bumpin' contradiction, laughin' at my old competition
Future brighter than a house nigga
You want a spot, you gotta show somethin'
Work 'til I'm on top, ballin' and shinin' like Joe Budden
Wait, flip that, I left school and started hustlin'
So when I left academics I stopped strugglin', uh
Pockets was feelin' like them levies in New Orleans, had some broke nights
And now I'm posted with the ballers, had some court fights
Rest in peace the homie [?]
Playin' Fortnite, feel like my circle gettin' smaller
When you legends gon' start rockin' with the youth?
I'm callin' you niggas out, you ain't hidin' from the truth, yeah
Talkin' 'bout when they was poppin' in the booth
But when they first started poppin' they was you, that's real
