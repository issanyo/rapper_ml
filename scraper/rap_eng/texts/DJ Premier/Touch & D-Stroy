[Intro]
Warning. The Surgeon General of Brooklyn, New York...has determined...that the sounds you are about to hear...will always be devastating...to your ear

[Scratching]
"And I'm hittin' 'em hard" - Da Band 'Bad Boy This And Bad Boy That'

[Verse One: Tony Touch]
I'm still capicu still sucka free
Comin' through with a little company
Now enough of this fuckery
If it's that boom bap rap that you want, come fuck with me
Toca!
A brand you can trust
Killin' shit still with my hand on my nuts
Back by popular demand it's a must
50 MC's with plans to discuss
Plus (say what?)
I be the first one to set it
Watch what you ask for, you just might get it
Go for mine before I live to regret it
I wrote this rhyme now you can see where I'm headed
Not bad for a rookie
That's why promoters still book me while y'all playin' hookey
And y'all thought I did it all for the nookie
Off the third rope like looky looky
(Looky Looky)
Superfly Snuka
Hit 'em with the left right, left right hook up
Touch and D-Stroy make you look up
While DJ Premier cuts the hook up
C'mon

"And I'm hittin' 'em hard"

[Hook: D-Stroy] {x2}
Ooh, why yes
You are now rockin' with the best
My rap niggas say "yes yes"
Oh that's fresh
C'mon and bring it out your chest
My rap bitches say "yes yes"

[Verse Two: D-Stroy]
I'mma destroy
Standin' in my D-Stroy stance
Gotta shine like the glow in Bruce Leroy's hands
Out of this world wild, gettin' Leonard Nimoy amped
50 MC's, 'bout to rip like B-Boy's pants
Yikes!
Bushwick SON
I am a little nutty
So lyrical kids will love me till I kill your buddy
And leave 'em like Silly Putty
From this McGillicutty to Magilla Gorilla nigga I'm talkin' everybody
Maxwell's Memorex
Tone Touch forever fresh
Headphones, hoodie on like Bill Belichick
Act disorderly
I keep whores with me
Cause groupies wanna fuck a legend like Kimora Lee
Get up, stand up, c'mon put your hands up
Mosh to the tracks before they put us all in handcuffs
Yeah people tweeting "D is a beast"
Clean version I ain't bleepin' with you bleepin' MCs
C'mon

[Hook]

"I'm hittin' 'em hard"
"I'm back and I'm hittin' 'em hard"
"Tony Touch"
