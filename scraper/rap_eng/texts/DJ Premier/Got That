Let's get 'em LOC

[Verse 1 : MC Eiht]
I'm one hundred from the hood point of view (geah)
West-west y'all my hood niggas stay true (west)
My jeans still sag, the color still blue
Hood shit, nigga spit geah, only a few
That's what it do LOC, I don't flip
Gang shit for the grip compton on trip
And it's so necessary  I don't follow the speech
My motto be the hollow point slug for each
Fuck the radio, ban me, they can't stand me
Never winnin' a grammy, still gon' [?]
Bitch give a fuck about swag
I'm a real D boy check the duffel bag
Compton till I die, or somebody kill
The hood got me back like that for real
Nigga chill got it back on lock
That real deal heavy weight flood the bock (geah)

Nigga I be the truth
Every line is mines I spit in the booth
Tryna make that shit that make you feel good
Never commercial, Eiht real hood
Who would? Nobody but your nigga
Rep to get dough just like he should (geah)
Eiht never change programs
Dance records, muthafucka slow jams
For the bitches that smoke and love real Gs
Nappy ass head niggas with tatts like hes (g-geah)

[Verse 3 : MC Eiht]
Geah, it's hood shit when the streets start yellin'
That west coast dope, muthafuckas keep sellin'
Anybody tellin', keep spreadin' word
Authentic to the ear, so pure you heard
Everything is bomb
When the real gon' drop so these niggas gon' [?]
Stop in the name of the streets
These niggas tryna serve y'all backin' soda [?]
Tryna [?] top when their shit don't pop
In the land of the lost, scream hell is hot
One shot make me kill niggas chance
Indeed take a chance be the circumstance
Eiht got the flava of the year
Gangsta 'round here with my nigga Premier
Steer clear for the weapon's test
Enemy to your hood so they make an arrest
