[Verse 1]
There are times when I look above and beyond
There are times when I feel your love all around me baby
I'll never forget my baby

When I feel that I don't belong, draw my strength
From the words when you said
Hey, it's about you, baby
Look deeper inside you, baby

[Pre-Chorus]
I dream about us together again
And what I want us together again
I know we'll be together again
And I'm so happy for my, baby, yeah

[Chorus]
Everywhere I go
Every smile I see
I know you are there
Smiling back at me
Dancing in moonlight
I know you are free
'Cause I can see your star
Shining down on me

[Post-Chorus]
(Together again, ooh)
Good times we'll share again
(Together again, ooh)
It makes me wanna dance
(Together again, ooh)
Say it loud and proud
All my love's for you

[Verse 2]
Always been a true angel to me, now above
I can't wait for you to wrap your wings around me baby
Ooh, wrap them around me, baby
Sometimes hear you whispering, no more pain
No worries, will you ever see now, baby
I'm so happy for my baby

[Pre-Chorus]
I dream about us together again
And what I want us together again
I know we'll be together again
And I'm so happy for my, baby, yeah

[Chorus]
Everywhere I go
Every smile I see
I know you are there
Smiling back at me
Dancing in moonlight
I know you are free
'Cause I can see your star
Shining down on me

Everywhere I go
Every smile I see
I know you are there
Smiling back at me
Dancing in moonlight
I know you are free
'Cause I can see your star
Shining down on me

[Post-Chorus]
(Together again, ooh)
Good times we'll share again
(Together again, ooh)
It makes me wanna dance
(Together again, ooh)
Say it loud and proud
All my love's for you

[Interlude]
There are times when I look above and beyond
There are times when I feel you smile upon me, baby
I'll never forget my baby
What I'd give just to hold you close
As on earth
In heaven we will be together baby
Together again, my baby

[Chorus]
Everywhere I go
Every smile I see
I know you are there
Smiling back at me
Dancing in moonlight
I know you are free
'Cause I can see your star
Shining down on me

Everywhere I go
Every smile I see
I know you are there
Smiling back at me
Dancing in moonlight
I know you are free
'Cause I can see your star
Shining down on me

Everywhere I go
Every smile I see
I know you are there
Smiling back at me
Dancing in moonlight
I know you are free
'Cause I can see your star
Shining down on me
