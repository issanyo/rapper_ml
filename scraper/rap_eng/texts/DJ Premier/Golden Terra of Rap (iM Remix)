[Canibus]
DJ Premier on the boards
Can-I-Bus on the bars with the Lyrical Law
Just listen to the rhymes, don't behave cruel to be kind
And I'ma show you how I'm nice with mines
Forced to start from scratch to rhyme from the heart when I rap
Looking forward to not looking back
I spit supernatural, look out for the planet sized shrapnel
Rip the Jacker bout to get at you
Ripping: Seek & Destroy the motherfucking beat mission
The rugged rude boy rasta on roids tripping
Martial arts for the mind, Mandelbrot Hip Hop design
You don't understand, stop trying!
The Hip Hop conglomerate, we legends putting it down
You got to honor it, fuck the politics
The B-2 bomb pilot waiting for that long silence
Then I will diagnose with tinnitus
The cuneiform symbols on my uniform tell you what I been through
Nigga, i wish it was that simple
The Master Gunnery Combatant blasting mixtape assassin
Cptn. Cold Crush get it cracking
Heat it up till the bones blacken
My microphone double action, I grab it, switch to automatic
The savage spitting it rapid, I ricochet 7.62 Jacket
Full Metal Gold Plaque classics

[Chorus x2: Canibus]
I take it back, back to the Golden Era of Rap
When it was exactly that
Not specifically jams in the park
But when emcees used to talk with advanced thought
