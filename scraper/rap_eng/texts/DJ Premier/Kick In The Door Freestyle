[Verse 1: Dylan]
Droppin' bombs like the Vietnam war
Kick in the door, waving the 44
Got my mind open like pores
Black and white stripes on a horse
You whores, dont celebrate the fourth
Slave in my mind, slave in the eyes
Like a male lion slaving his pride
Watch the bats fly
What is better tekken or tech 9's
I brought guns to a knife fight
And still managed to get stabbed in the back
Cause you niggas is rats that got ate by a snake
Tattle-tellers get smacked with a rake
I'm about to unfold hell like soft shell tacos
Oooooo (kill 'em)
Killing these asshole
Put poison in yo eggrolls
Me and Naz on tracks, like bow and arrows
Kicking ass like Chavo and Eddie Guerrero
You niggas better narrow down cause I'm the assassin bastard
Hair's to Jurassic, dont ask me to comb my naps bitch
And y'all just asking for me to put a hole in your ass quick
Naz said "you better turn up on this track or get held back like retarded asses"
I'm too nice like white people on Halloween
Homicide, murder scenes, lint lickers cootie queens
Flows nasty, uncooked onion rings
I'm the king and y'all just unleashed the beast
Won't stop, won't cease til all are deceased

[Verse 2: Nahgato]
Naz is like sex to a nympho
But nothing sweet
I"m like beef with a piece to your temple
I'm too official, I go harder than cold nipples
So what's the issue?
I'll let my kunai split you
I've been spitting this ill since fifteen
Dropping sweet sixteens, spitting like an m16 plus sixteen
I bet you felt that pain your cavity
Got these lames mad at me
Cause they wanna be down, but we dont really fuck with gravity
Actually
We the fliest in the galaxy, battle me
I can see through your strategy, stop it
See you dont matter when rap is the topic
I see through your logic
Hypnotic when i spit the narcotics
I live in a comic, im stan lee
Mixed with a little mark bagely
Maybe a little biggie if i were richer than richie
I got my niggas with me
So if you wanna come and get me
Shit say no more
Cause believe me we want war
Yea, i said we want war
(i ain't finished, hold on)
Okay, kick in the door waving the 44
All you heard was Naz dont hit me no more
Gorilla warfare, we got apes galore
Explore your whore until she implores
Kick in the door waving the 44
All you heard was Naz dont hit me no more
Gorilla warfare, we got apes galore
Explore your whore until she implores
For more
Bitches

[Verse 3: Luke Royal]
You niggas live in a fantasy, my facts is quite actual
I know niggas who peel back and cap for the capital
Dont play games, no tic tac toe
When the clock tick
Niggas know we still get the dough
I'm not tryna rap like this or tryna rap like that
I'm striking like lightning, i know its quite frightening
Come through, the AK, show it, he gone
Dont try to be heroic, the poor mans poet
So pour up for the kid, my flow the pole
She work the pole, polar opposites
Or you could say that i am easily attractive
When im spitting om the tracks
And she just likes the way I'm in the back, pulling out the tracks
Okay, put me on the rack, I might turn to carl louis
Or Usain Bolt, a lightnening bolt when i strike or I stroke
It dont matter who it is, what i quote is greatness
Or when you quote me its greatness, dont taint this flow
Diluted when you spit it, but when i spit it, its only truth
And you know thats true, I give you proof
180 proof if you need it
Its abstract, i repeat it
Any feat is defeated, competition fleeted so as my fleet set sail
We excell, dropping balls dropping sells
Hit you with those shells and accelerate your cells
Yall niggas soft as sea shells
Or she sells sea shells by the sea shore
Sally please
