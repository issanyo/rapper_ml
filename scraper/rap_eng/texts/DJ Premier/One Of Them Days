[Verse]
I woke up to a gypsy yelling gibberish
So I blasted Rebecca Black back to be equally ridiculous
Still half asleep, I go to brush my teeth
Mistakenly, I grabbed the Soft Scrub with bleach
I burned the shit out of my gums
But at least my smile is a little brighter than it was
Into the kitchen for a little Cap N' Crunch
And just my luck, the milk poured out in chunks
Maybe I'll just get back in bed
For a reenactment with a dime I just met
A top model, looking like Christina Milian
But now more like Troy Polamalu
Snatched up my t-shirt, ran out the house
Little did I know, I really grabbed her blouse
Ran until I lost her
Around the corner was the gypsy who scratched my cheek and said "balder"
