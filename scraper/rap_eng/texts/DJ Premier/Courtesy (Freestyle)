[Verse 1: Rob A]
This is the moment of truth
We the owners, and you?
Can step in the arena
And let 'em see ya
But ya beef'll be beat up
By the leader of the scene
I'll fill you with a full clip
To keep the masses appealed
Yeah that is the real
Nah, no gangster shit
Just a kid bumping Gang Starr hits
From a city called The Roc
No kidding, it's The Rob
Make the Streets Hop
When they see Rob
The God emcee in the minds of yours and mine
I'm in my prime
And I'm married to a dime
Hip-hop's the illest bitch
And the trillest shit?
Her buns be so perfect for a pimp, see?
I be drilling it
Man, if you tried it'd be like putting a five milligram pill in it
Um, I slayed 'em
I'm surfing through the lyrical murder, crime waving
They tried to stop me but I ate 'em
Like I'm ingesting the law (um)
Whack rappers all I see, cut it out, I'll invest in a saw
Man, all I do is mess with these songs
Listen to Cozz in the car, what's the effect of it all?
Man, I tried to quit, kid, it wasn't effective at all
I just have to spit, bitch, like I was destined to ball
I bounced back so high you wouldn't mention my fall
So here's a lesson for y'all
Be the realest, be the truest, be the best of 'em all
I'm in the building, you were left in the hall
So what's the lesson, recall?
My flow can pour slow, it's my specialty sauce
I'm just a little ticked, kid, don't piss the rest of me off
Say you the best, if it's in jest than be gone
I eat a beat, digest and then yawn
(Isn't that special?)

[Outro: Rob A]
Awww
Naw
I'm Raw...b Ayyeee

I wanna be (wanna be)
The very best (very best)
Like no one (no one)
Ever was
(I respect that)
