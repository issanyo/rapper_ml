[Spoken: Sir Cognac, the Conversation]
And now, the night time...

[Intro: Cee-Lo]
Late in the evening, there is the thieving
And the trickin and the trappin, and they ain't actin
We make it happen
We'll get the guns on anyones and get to clappin', even for rappin'
Does it surprise ya?
We'll readjust and reconcile and recognize up, that I'm a writer
Oh yes I write up
Now open wide and let me put the night inside ya

[Verse: Cee-Lo]
This is music usually confused with major motion picture
No one is stricter about it being status for scripture
No put on your gut is goin', you're wearin' what don't fit ya
You better run little one, cause the rhythm's gonna getcha
And when it hits ya, it usually hits somebody with ya
Make 'em risk a total eclipse of sun to get richer
Baby, a little time and something fine that'll fix ya
With shield love you forgot to remember to miss ya
The nightlife, the dark side of the city
Gon' be on 24 inches, and be defenseless
The nightlife, the dark side of my heart
Where no one really knows you, and no one supposed you
The nightlife, the dark side of my soul
Where if somebody crossed you, kill 'em up off you!
The nightlife, the dark side of the moon
Where the sun is scared to come (give me some) ha!

[Chorus]
Take me where the darkness is still beautiful!
Oh, wanna go, wanna go, wanna go
Wanna know, wanna go, wanna go
Wanna go, wanna go, wanna go
Wanna know, wanna go, wanna go
Give me the night! The night is gonna getcha, ah, it's gonna getcha
The night is gonna getcha, ahhh its gonna getcha
Give me the night! The night is gonna getcha, ah, it's gonna getcha
The night is gonna getcha, ahhh its gonna getcha
Give me the night! The night is gonna getcha, ah, it's gonna getcha
The night is gonna getcha, hey its gonna getcha
Give me the night! The night is gonna getcha, ah, it's gonna getcha

[Verse 2: Chazzie]
I'll be your lady, fairweather friend
I'll be honest, and I'll pretend
I'll act like I love ya, oh
I'll act like I love ya, oh (give me some now)

[Chorus]
Take me where the darkness is still beautiful!

[Verse 3:Cee-Lo]
I've been runnin' since "Rock Box"
I've cocked Glocks and locked blocks and rocked rocks
And dropped tops, the obviously odd, five foot six inch God
In the flesh, I've been the best, I'll get in your chest and in the mess
In your vest and out your back without even getting out the 'llac
I lied about how I really handled that situation about the AK
I'll hit back, if your lead was the only collateral you got I'll get back
Now get flat, say a prayer cause shorty want this shit back
Sit back, this chit-chat is pitch black, but you can still see
What I'm sayin', and heavy is how I weigh in
Niggas love singin' sad songs about how bad they want to stay in
Either hold out on basketball playin or make use of some yay' then

[Spoken: Sir Cognac, the Conversation]
Wooooo, Lord, sho' feel good to me
I promise, I promise
Not to ever, ever leave this night life alone
This me (Me too!) Yup, this me
This me (And me three) Have mercy

[Chorus]
