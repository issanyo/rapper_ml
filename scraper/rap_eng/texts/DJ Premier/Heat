[Intro]
DJ Premier trilogy starts in: 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, go!

[Verse 1]
Remember times when we lived on the edge of the town?
I do, I see the fields across the street
Remember times when we haven't any time to sit down?
I do, and the smell of the wet concrete
I gave a fuck just 'bout to play the ball with my friends
Thought that this life never ends, and it made sense
For me when I was nearly 7 years old
Mama feed with apples and chips were the gold
I could run the whole world to get pack of Lays
I hid them under the T-shirt and hoped she won't see my face
'Till I enter the bathroom and wash it off real quick
Then I said "I ain't hungry", she be thinking I'm sick
And everyday was a challenge to not get caught
Mission was to not let her connect these dots
And if she find the pack of Luxe with cheese I brought
25 fucking minutes of listening how mama tripping,  fuck

[Man talking on the phone]

[Verse 2]
It was 9 years ago but seems like yesterday
No I got new things to learn and new games to play
I just achieved level twenty in steam
But the wet dream is still in the list of my purposes
I try not to show it, but it comes to the surface
It is simple as that, I need only one person
Rather girl than guy, isn't it?
I think the sis of my homie gonna perfectly fit
Or maybe friend of my sis, or maybe sis of my dog
Maybe cat of my brother, just need somebody to fuck
Freaking animal instincts, can't ignore them
I hope it's hardest part of this fucking life exam

[Man talking on the phone]

[Verse 3]
I say hello to the world I was brought to
There's a lotta shit in here, but let's check another view
Nas released 10 albums, but this is my debut
If you ain't getting my words, i'll construe
So what about your sister? She so damn pretty
But... wait, I gotta hold down the city
