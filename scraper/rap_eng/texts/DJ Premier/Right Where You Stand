Always said if I was put on the spot to spit on a beat
First thing ima do is bring up the streets
The ones you never meet
Rest in peace
And the ones going thro the struggle not tryna settle
Fuck the police
In the same car as Rodney King
Hoody on like Trayvon
The games on
You see my attitude
I ain't mad at you
Cops in my rear view
I see the helicopters too
I got the chopper too
Lord knows what we about to do
T.I in the passenger
Huey in the back
Pac with the bandana
Polishing the mac
In a all black Cadillac
From the bottom of the map
And I'm always on point
When I sleep , I can't relax
I be lost in the music
Tryna find my way back
In fact
I'm trapped in a maze
Alone on the stage
Funny how time flys
When u rhyming
Making beats you wanna give up
But you keep on trying but you
Tired of the cycle
Same shit different day
How can I get away
& maintain & stay sane
Keep my headphones on
Im in the zone wanna be left alone
& I'm gone
