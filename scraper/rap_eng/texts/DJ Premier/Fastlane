[Scratching]:
Edo G

[Verse One]:
I speak for the hood, I speak for the 'burbs
I speak for the G's, I speak for the herbs
My feet in the street, your food on the curb
I speak a different language, you speak a few words
Responsibility and humility in a world of hostility
My best ability is availability
What's yours?
With no possibilities and closed doors
I thought it was rap, y'all Dairy Queens
Cats who get scared by scary things
See what the Berry brings?
Hip hop them heavy things
And to me it means everything
You either lookin' or you facin' somethin'
Everybody's either chasin' or runnin' away from somethin'
It ain't just rap, I teach it well
Speak it well
You lookin' at Heaven from a seat in Hell
It's Edo

[Scratch Hook]:
Why these rappers so soft?
They corny ass raps be makin' me dose off
The original O.G
Watch us comin' up in the fastlane

[Verse Two]:
Yo, classics last they get played on
My music all colors like a box of crayons
But I'm as black as Akon
Cause killers get prayed for, victims get preyed on
The crew around you should ground you
If the people don't change, change the people around you
I shake hands never pass my brothers
Fortune smiles at some but laughs at others
You report news, I make news
Bend or break rules on you crews and these fake dudes
Boycott your music like my boy Blues
The shoemakers children always goes without shoes
We don't lose, I always win
Only two dudes can do this so I guess I gotta twin
Edo a champ, go ahead, drop the confetti
Primo cut it with a scalpel and not a machete
It's Edo

[Scratch Hook]:
Why these rappers so soft?
They corny ass raps be makin' me dose off
The original O.G
Watch us comin' up in the fastlane
