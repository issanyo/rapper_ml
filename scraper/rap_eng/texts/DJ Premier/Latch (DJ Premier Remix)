You left my heart out
When the rest of me is down
You, you enchanted me, even when you are not around
If there are boundaries, I will try to knock them down
I'm latching on they
Now I know what I have found

I feel you close enough
I wanna latch in your love
I think we're close enough
Cuz I latch when you're mine

Now I got you in my space
I won't let go with you
What you shackle in my embrace
I'm latching on you

Now I got you in my space
I won't let go with you
What you shackle in my embrace
I'm latching on you

I'm so encaptured, got wrapped up in your touch
Feel so enamored, hold me tighter then your clutch
How do you do it, you got me losing every breath
Why did you give me to make my heart bleed out my chest

I feel you close enough
I wanna latch in your love
I think we're close enough
Could I latch in your love, baby
I feel we're close enough
I wanna latch in your love
I think we're close enough
Could I latch in your love, baby

Now I got you in my space
I won't let go with you
What you shackled in my embrace
I'm latching on you

Now I got you in my space
I won't let go with you
What you shackled in my embrace
I'm latching on you
Latching on you
I won't let go with you
(I won't let go)
Latching on you
I won't let go with you
