[Verse]
I'm Basquiat in the art of rap
You call it trap
You find your pleasure in shallow thots
You shadowbox
I fight demons for sleep at night
I'm Kryptonite
My flow been as tight as your girl pussy
Cuz you dont hit it right
Get your program blocked
We be nick at nite
Get prison time
For selling nicks at night
It isnt right
My flow is rudimentary prison knife
It isnt hype
Im just tryna be here
Be here to enlight
The delight of victory of seeing your jaw drop to floor
The crowd fiend and applause, could there be more?
The flow never thrifty like can you macklemore
I been the quarterback, made the defense tackle the floor
Mans wanted his quarterback, threw a bullet
Made mans tackle the floor
Like damn that was savage and raw
Energizer shots made his battery gone
He needed duracells for his body to battle that war
Now his body not warm, he in the morgue
3 in the morn, deep in my zone
No devil shit
But the streets spit hot hellish clips
We selling it;, exploring these topics on my Magellin ish
Its relevant
I only tell it cause its prevalent
This the type of shit that got K-Dot out of his ELEMENT
You niggas mustard thought u was gon ketchup
But u buns as hell, I sit back and I relish it
Who you telling shit
