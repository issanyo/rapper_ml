[Verse 1: OP]
I bet you would feel me if I had a silly trick
Or if i told you "flip a brick"
Even if the brick that I told you to flip
Had never been flipped
By the one that told you "flip"
You'd fuck around get picked up
By the cops, feeling G
Talk about, you want to be like me
With OP on your G playlist
Well keep it G
Because you see what they tell you see
Now I see
I see you only feel it if its weak
If its cheap, if its heavy deep
Dripping in deceit, your deceased
By the memories they told you see
But never been in
Its kind of like your Kel, they're like Kenan
If they show you orange soda
You will scream
I'm trying to get my parents of the scene
You don't feel that
Trying to get my sisters of the scene
You don't feel that
Trying to keep it 7 more than 3
You don't feel that
You only conceal that and follow whats not real
So now tell me how you would feel?
If every time you went into the field or the void
They were telling you their thoughts what they think?
"You should think about doing things"
"Doing things like the other niggas"
"You think I really want to be like them other niggas?"
I m trying to take over the world and
Give it to this girl that I saw on the gram
Don't know if she has got a man
"what you saying?"
We can plan if I can, you hear me on this jam
Its a plan
Hope you feel me

[Hook: OP]
Feel me, Feel me
Feel me, Feel me
Feel me, Feel me
Feel me, Feel me
Feeling me, feeling me, fulfilling me
Are you feeling me? Feeling me?
Fulfilling me. X2

[Verse 2: OP]
My butterfly keeps flowing
Time keeps going "For Free?"
"Crown" me King Mic
"Institutionalized" in these walls
Are "U" "Alright" ?
I'm pale, but my intellect is not "For Sale"
My "Mum" taught me about "Politics"
"How much a pound cost"
My "Complexion and the color of Zulu Love"
"Blacker the berry" "i" ain't gotta lie
I, a "Mortal Man" Pimp by butterfly
This is a story of a chap
That sat in the back and
Oh snap he can rap and ain't going the trap route
Like every lad that's puts pen to the pad
Truth
Hes spitting the facts, every track
"But you don't feel me!"
A "Good Kid, Mad City" with "GOOD Music"
A "Dream villain", "Illmatic"
With no "Blueprint"
"Before the money" was tough
But I'm not "Ready To Die"
Because "All Eyes On Me" like Slim Shady!
I ain't Jay Z, ain't Kendrick, and ain't Marshall
I hate Arsenal
Love women that wear pea coats
I hate free throws, too easy I will eat those
I'm Kobeing, so being my own being
That my own being, don't know what my eyes seeing
So I'm preeing, still looking for life's meaning
On IG and, I'm just trying to find the real me
And I'm just hoping that they feel me..
