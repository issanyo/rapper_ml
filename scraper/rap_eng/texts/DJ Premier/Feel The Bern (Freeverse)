Read Chris Webby's Explanation of "#FeelTheBern (Freeverse)"

[Intro]
Ya
Webby's Lab 2!
CT, what up man, still got those motherfucking bars on deck

[Verse 1]
I'm a killer whale
My frigging tail could tip the scales
And my train of thought is so heavy that I could strip the rails
On dark nights, you ain't catching me with Christian Bale
I'm a Tom Hardy and Ledger up in the city jail
Fuck bail, I'm already down in hell and chilling
Raise hell and sinnin'
Not counting on the day that I meet God and get to hang around in heaven with him
So when I'm Grammy winning, giving acceptance speeches
I ain't sharing the credit with him
Machete gripping
And Redy Whipping, up in my Chevy ripping
From Connecticut to your television, you better listen
Cause the flow's so vicious
I'm superhuman all they are is superstitious
So watch yourself bitches
Cause I be so malicious, vicious
So stay the mother fuck up out my business
I roll up and hit this now I am so lit
It is clear I'm on grass like a picnic
And you know we blunt sparking
Eyes lower than Ben Carson's
Space Jam ballin', I am Marvin the Martian
Pardon, I heat it up like methane and carbon
But I'm going green, solar panels in my garden
I'm committing arson when I drop my project
And I'ma burn your house down with the shit I drop next
Connecticut to the prime meridian listen in
I'm up in every classroom, home and condominium
And I cause a racket bitch, and I'm not talking Wimbeldon
I get it in
That's why they seeing Web like they looking between the toes of an amphibian, I'm brilliant
These other rappers talk but we ain't buying it
Like they selling bottled tap water from Flint Michigan
Bitches I'm on my shit again
Thinking back on life but now it's different
Always evolving, I'm so Darwinian
I'm no simpleton, Webby here to get it in
And I got my Michelin's grippin' the pavement
It's ride or die, bitches let me get an amen
My rap game's godly, pull up with a poss√©
Rocking the ear flaps like Kyle Broflovski
Webby kamikaze, bonzai watch me
Detonator in my pocket like a Tamagotchi
Swerving like I'm Ozzy, I think it was the molly
I put it down for months but my brain's still foggy
I'll be doing this until the day I go senile
Forget how to write, perform and spit freestyles
I'ma kill shit 'til then with no retrial
Cause I got my lawyer Saul Goodman on the speed-dial
Meanwhile, I'ma swerve like I'm flippin' a bitch
And it's simple as this, on these minimalists
Cannot hang with the bar heavy lyrical shit
When I'm back up in that lab like Kibbles and Bits
Get it? Like retriever? The dog, Labrador?
No? What the fuck, all I'm asking for is you to understand me
And some money for the package store
I need a dollar, can you loan me some Macklemore?
I want them Thrift Shop checks
So I don't care who I piss off next
Clock in, not a shift off yet
It ain't easy trying to live off debt
Put in work but nobody getting rich off sweat
You see I really love rapping bro
But now it's turned into a motherfucking fashion show
They wearing skirts and flip flops, what the fuck he doing?
With pants so tight, you see the damn buttcheeks through em
I'm East Coast cause my sweats in Timbos
A scruffy ass face, cigarette, and brim low
With a sexy bimbo, big breasted nympho
Giving head in a rented limo
So check your info
The game looking real concerned
Cause when I'm on, I'ma steal your turn
I'm like Senator Sanders mixed with a fucking Charmander
So, either way you gonna feel the burn
