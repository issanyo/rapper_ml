[Verse 1: Abstrakt]
Oh shit
It’s the metaphorical medical corporal
Causing more destruction in your area than whirlpools
I got this, inconspicuous like the Loch Ness
Appearance is negative it’s as if I got the wrong test
Televised, meaning contextual misinformation
Politically issued washing into mental assimilation
Your structure is simple, similar to prokaryotes
Grow curious, cherry it, carry it to the chariot
Now look, stop it, drop it, you ain’t a lyrical prophet
‘Cause all the lines you write are purely made for profit
Lost it, wrapped these other rappers heads in cellophane
Took a hit, Rihanna, now you can call me a mellow brain
My opposition to my competition is composition
Of exposition for decomposition of your rap position
Listen, ‘cause I’m on a lyrical mission
That’s leavin’ you wishin’ that you could gain these skills by addition
It’s an addiction with diction and flowing hotter than friction
I’m not a Christian, but I still eat the blood and flesh in your kitchen
