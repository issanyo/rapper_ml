[Verse 1]
Strangely enough I've been struck
Affected by her smile, and yo, her style is worthwhile
And knowing that I'm deep like a river, I feel I should give her
Things that those others can't deliver
Contrary to what I had wished, it seems that I've been dissed
But hey, I don't want to miss this
Wonderful opportunity, my boys, they try schoolin' me
But see I know what I want
Someone who'll be there for the whole nine, this honey is so fine
But now she's hung up the line
Upset because I told her I'm busy, she made like a grizzly
And started chewin' my head off
Screamin' that I spend more time with friends
And also, she said I ruined her weekend
I said "I know the stuff we had planned but please understand
Right now I'm loungin' with my man"
I guess I didn't realize I'd hurt her, she said I had the nerve to
Just neglect her like that
Then she started bringing up past things and she kept asking
How come our love isn't lasting?
I said, "Hey baby, please calm down 'cause I'm still around
And it's for you that my heart pounds
Can I call you later on? You say I treat you wrong?
But why you flippin' on me?"
She said something else and then click
Left me alone on the phone with the tone
And now I'm Lovesick

[Bridge: DJ Premier scratching]
Love... sick, sick, sick, sick

[Verse 2]
Relationships can grip with the pain
Arguments in the crib, in the streets, on the train
I'm crazy fed but then still
When she ain't there I feel sad, I feel ill
Frowning 'cause I'm down in the dumps
The other night I took her out, so she could shake her rump
But after we were there for a few, some girls that I knew
Stepped up and asked me to come to
A party they were havin' at their house
I looked at my girl, and yo, she started walkin' out
I said "Hey love, just wait for a second, and won't you just check it?
It's all a part of makin' records
Those were just some friends in the business
No need to get angry, so listen up while I kick this
And what about the things we discussed about havin' trust?
What's all this attitude stuff?
Now hon, you know that I wouldn't play you
But time after time, you let your jealousy sway you
Hey, don't you turn your back like that, come on, this is wack
You're heated up like a thermostat"
Then she stepped off in a whirlwind
And I don't know when or if I'm gonna see her again
I could've sworn she was the right one to pick
But now... man, I'm just Lovesick
