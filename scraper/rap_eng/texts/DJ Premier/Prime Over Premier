Now I know y'all couldn't wait to hear Prime Over Premier
Kill you on a beat, then listen over the air
Cause y'all ain't nothing but rappers with expensive clothes
That's the reason ima leave y'all with expensive holes
See ain't none of y'all better than Prime
Kill any MC, get em right here, dead in a line
Understand I get better with time
I don't care if we tight, I still wanna dead you with rhymes
Cats always talking bout that "Save Hip-Hop" shit
Come down to it won't none of em cop shit
That's why when I get the microphone I rock shit
So I suggest all of y'all get off my dick
Too fly to be backpack. Not street enough to do trap rap
Just let me rap
Plug in, listen to this, and just sit back
You're gonna hear D Prime on these Preemo tracks
