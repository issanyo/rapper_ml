[Intro]
Real shit right here
Focus on the MC's a little
Turn it up
Yeah

[Scratches by DJ Premier]
"I grabbed the mic and never choked up"
"I grabbed the mic and never choked up"
"I grabbed the mic and never choked up"
"I'll fuck your ass up"

[Verse 1]
A yo Premier, these niggas tryna bite your feel
The boom boom bap don't even sound real
We're strapped with AK's that crack like old mics from Radioshack
We flow tight 'til the day we go back
To the es', bless
All the dope spitting MC's who left
While I'm here, I be the motherfucking best, yes, yes y'all
Bumpy in this motherfucker strapped with a vest, y'all
I hate them old ass flows stuck doing classic
And your new shit sounds like your old shit
Let a scholar help these niggas do some new scholastics
Young nigga say Bump spit the dope shit
I'm like Sly from Family Stone
My microphone's the focus, real MC's notice
But you sellout, you want to be something that you're not
You want to be rowdy but you're not
You want to be outie but you're shy
Down on the ground, screaming what you're not
You're not a gangster, not a thug, not a killer, not a rapper
Not a love you get from any one of us

[Hook]
Stay the fuck away from me
You bitchmade ass MC
You come around me
And I'll fuck your punk ass up
Just, stay the fuck away from me
You bitchmade ass MC
You come around me
And I'll fuck your punk ass up

[Verse 2]
I see you old ass rappers ballriding young niggas
Like short eyes, this shit is really embarrassing
You can keep the little boys, I'ma keep it moving
No comparison, I'ma get this money like a Carrington
Blake, ain't got time to hate on Drake
I'm trying to get my own motherfucking cake
Get your money, young nigga, and watch out for these snakes, they strike
Before you know it, you're in a fight with a cat that you put on
And he's saying that you need him, but he wrong
'Cause niggas don't dance to acapella songs
Sixteen bars of his Bentley Coupe
Four bars of Bump Knucks and you're sipping soup
Loser, you're funny looking like the PT Crusier
Got the Zab Judah jab, the four hit abuser
I'm on my Biggie with the boom bap, so gimme the loot
I'ma take it back to Championship hoodies and Timberland boots

[Hook]
Stay the fuck away from me
You bitchmade ass MC
You come around me
And I'll fuck your punk ass up
So, stay the fuck away from me
You bitchmade ass MC
You come around me
And I'll fuck your punk ass up
