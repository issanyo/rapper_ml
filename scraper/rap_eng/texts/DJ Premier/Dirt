[Intro: DJ Premier & Big Shug]
DJ Premier: Ayo, what up, Shug?
Big Shug: What's popping kid, what's going down
DJ Premier: I got a question, yo, do you ever do dirt, man?
Big Shug: Man you already know the answer to that

[Intro: Big Shug]
Yeah, one two, one two
Big Shug, Big Shug
Ha
Hold me down
What
We get down and dirty, grimy, what

[Scratches by DJ Premier]
"Dirty"
"I advise you to tell us where the cash is"

[Verse 1: Big Shug]
I bounce checks and tote tecs
Left chumps twice my size flat on the deck
From the rough fisticuffs, knuckle game supreme
Always took it to them streets for the stacks of cream
Muscle the hustlers, fuck the diplomacy
The more money to get, the more money for me
See, I held tre pound pain to brains
Left people shaking to death in pee stains
Insane? I guess when I was smoking that shit
Suitcase money and a bedroom full of bricks
I smacked fathers and brothers for fronting
But I never hit no sister or mother for nothing, respect
I know where the bodies lay low
In places where most men are scared to go
But I won't turn states on records and tapes
So the secrets will stay all the way to my grave
I took weight from London to Japan
And returned to Murderpan still the man
Don't get it twist by the jewels and whip
Most of my life, I hustled for material shit
Fuck what you thought, I'm far from rich
But when that day comes, I refuse to switch
But you'll be gunning for me then
'Cause I got two more years to outlive my sins
I like puddin on some DL shit
But I never swung dick to a Porky-The-Pig-looking bitch
For me, I do what work
And if it don't work, then I return to do dirt
My word

[Hook: Scratches by DJ Premier]
"Now get low when I do dirt"
"I do a lot of dirty shit"
"Dirty"
"I advise you to tell us where the cash is"
"Now get low when I do dirt"

[Verse 2: Smiley The Ghetto Child]
I keep dirt in my drawers, got the four in the draw
I was filthy on tour, robbing rich for the poor
Uptown to score from the papi store
Act like I brought the soda, but it's really the raw
In them dirty pins with trifling gents
Some niggas rob their moms just to get a hit
Dirty lawyers, dirty cops, even scheme on plots
You can pay a filthy judge just to skip and leave town
I ain't underground, I'm under the underground
With worms and germs, where the fire don't burn
I pollute my lungs like a Russian sun
Yeah rats in subways, dirty gun trays
I'm dirty like the corner that's infested with the rest of it
'Cause God never blessed it, my lungs stay congested
I'm filthy like the [?] when your ass get arrested
And dirty like a gun with no member when I test it

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Hannibal Stax]
Straight out of Brooklyn where we get to them, hustling
Scrambling through boroughs and states, no escape, trapped within my actions in
Learned to do dirt when y'all was learning how to backspin
Blew shots at niggas for the love of how the barrel spin
Cheated on my girl 'cause bitches found me attractive
By the age of 13, I was heavily crime active
Now I travel the path that's narrow within
But wear my frown, throw that upside-down devilish grin
Still looked at as the crook that sneak the metal in
Once even poisoned my own fam in the effort to win
Down my regrets in [?], poker bets, and gin
Let's not talk about stress, I don't know where to begin
All I know is when it came to ends, I robbed an old time friend
Ran to him recently and made amends
But if worst comes to worst, I'ma rob him again
If it's work, I'm getting dirty, I meant no need to pretend
Fuck the bullshit

[Hook]

[Outro: Big Shug]
One thing I hate is some straight fake motherfuckers who really ain't got no idea on what's real
So they're living a fantasy world and they think that's what it's all about
But they don't really know what's really real
