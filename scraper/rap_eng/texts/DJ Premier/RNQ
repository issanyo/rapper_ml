[Intro]
You can send us to the state penitentiary
You can send us to the county farm or your county jails
And hit us across the head with your sticks and let your dogs bite us
But we don't care. Cause we ain't scared of your jail now, cause we want our freedom!

"You understand that nigga? You understand that?"
Real nigga quotes. El Che. Real nigga quotes. Uh, Chi-Town. Look, Plug City
"And this I quote"

[Verse One]
We ain't land on Plymouth Rock
The Rock landed on us
So we cut it up and bag it till it land us in cuffs
I beat a nigga down till he can't stand to get up
And spread the word around till our whole planet gets touched
These real nigga quotes, they the quotes I hope
Can help brothers who sell dope or feel worthless broke
Malcolm X said we gotta get paid by any means
If you don't stand for somethin' you'll fall for anything
Yeah
All for one, one for all
Grab a gun and keep bustin' if I happen to fall
Don't look back, cause when they have you back to the crawl
Back to that 9 to 5 with your back to the wall
That's why I say, "Fuck 'em all"
Hillary, Jesse Jack, even Barrack's involved
When police beatin our ass, none of y'all do a damn thang
But you can raise a hundred million for a campaign?
Homie, you better explain
I'm in a cell with a nigga that look like Ving Rhames
When it rains it pours
This the type of rhyme that'll spark the war
Part the floor
Empower the poor
Read my lips
Primo start the chorus

[Scratch Hook]
"And this I quote"

[Verse Two]
You want the truth?
You can't handle the truth
Snitch recruits, federal agents on the roof
Chicks that's cute
Don't turn around when they pull it!
[Sample of Bill Clinton talking]
"I did not have sexual relations with that woman"
I hope not fam-o
Praise the lord and pass the ammo
? holy Koran say to tie your camel
That mean protect your interests
Block the entrance
Don't let them hit you off with them new offenses
The walls are barred, the guns the guards
You can jail me
Still you can't imprison a cause
Me against the world?
That just even the odds
You hate life, you believe that it's hard
So I'm comin' with these real nigga quotes
They the quotes I hope
Can help brothers who sell dope or feel worthless broke
Malcolm X said we gotta get paid by any means
If you don't stand for somethin' you'll fall for anything

[Different men talking]
Uncle Sam, who is guilty of all of thee
Uh, violations of our rights that have taken place in this country
So the only way our people can really get some meaningful results
It has to be taken out of Uncle Sam's hands
It is a fact that WE built this country
Nobody else. I'll explain that to you
When this country started, economically it was an agricultural country
The cash crop on the world market was cotton
WE PICKED THE COTTON! WE PICKED THE COTTON! We did
Why do you insist on keeping us caged?
You know all that does is intensify rage
Every group of brothers should have at least one white guy, for safety
For when the shit goes down, somebody's gonna have to talk to the police
The black man must be a provider. He must be a maintainer
He must secure and protect the black woman
The black man who will not work is a black man who is a drag
To the black family. A black man who only knows how to make a baby
But does not know how to protect that child
Who does not want to feed and secure that child
Is an enemy to the rise of the black man
I want you to understand it. I want to talk to you brother
We shall overcome
Just tell me you don't do that in the revolution
You don't do any singin', you're too busy swingin'
