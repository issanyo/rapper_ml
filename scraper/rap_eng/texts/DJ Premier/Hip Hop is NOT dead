It's Benevolent baby, What up NaS?
Ayo you said hip hop is dead right?, Right

[Verse 1: Benny Boy]
Is hip hop dead?, Nope I promise
Obviously it just got on it's
Two feet after rap done knocked it
Unconscious, left it there unwanted
Left it there, face down crying out
But even Batman needed Robin's help
And he told me that he couldn't do it hisself
So I grabbed a microphone off his utility belt
And I grabbed a couple pens, grabbed a couple pencils
Grabbed a sheet of paper, and I grabbed an instrumental
Grabbed a couple things just to show you what he's been through
Got a lil' nervous of what I was getting into
Didn't intend to show you what it's come to
People in the cypher spitting mic check, one two
Everybody rocking gold chains with the jumpsuit
Then all of a sudden everybody's all gun proof
If you wasn't gun proof, they didn't even want you
And if they ain't want to, you didn't even want to
So you went with the trend and did what yo was told to
Let the industry take over and control you
So you should have switched, you should have flip flopped
Cause the executives are saying, "You should get shot"
I'm not trying to get popped or get dropped
Cause I'm not gun proof and neither is hip hop
