I’m the type to make some fly shit, nah I ain’t like others
You niggas playing, and me I just write, brother
You get left, viciously stepping with this murder weapon
I give you lead like Zeppelin that’s a ''Stairway to heaven''
Presidential flow, nah I can’t be trendy or random
I got to make my moniker blow: Lewinsky scandal
Like a nudist club you niggas don’t get close, to say
Even next to Sean Carter, I’m more than a protégé
I ain't buying offers, you niggas be dyin’ like Sawyer
Just to get to touch some mic nickels, your life’s little
I’m better than all you niggas, wanna step and see?
If you think you can be betting it, you better get your sheets
I’m the only made man here, and I don’t mess with you
Underdog killing the vets and move, ejecting dudes
Wrecking crews, I’m just a thinker and you’re not ready
I got paunches like groups of drinkers with potbellies
You rot really, killing dreamers coldly; yes I glow with it quick
You’re Angelina Jolie; that means you’re close to a pit
As a whole my raps deeper all the foes getting sick
They wanna see the dock like a lost boat on a trip, no fronting
All respect to Joe Budden, but shit is true if I was you
I would never let Hollow win like a Jehovah’s Witness
Flows I’m kicking em, niggas ranting I’m evicting em
Sucker you don’t hit licks so spit it how you live it, son
