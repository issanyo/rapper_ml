[Intro: You-C]
Yeah
I think I'm a call this one...
Tazzy's Rubix Cube
I got my nigga Lil Kydd with me
Shaz Krew to Lost in the 312
You know, it's a suburban thing
Yeager!

[Verse 1: You-C]
My life is brilliant. I'm steady daydreaming of a million
Fantasize about bad bitches falling from the ceiling
My flows be killing like it is Frieza against Krillin
My style is like Ant-Man, espionage, I gotta steal it
If I ruled the world, then Nas would be president
And all the angels I come across would be Heaven sent
Instead of demons with make-up who try to blow you
Like opportunities, failed by all the opps who try to know you
I'm charged up, like Drizzy Drake when he's getting fired
Lazy as fuck, I tried to move the "R" but I'm tired
Bitches be choosy and still choosing the wrong nigga
Like how you want a nerd from Englewood who be pulling triggers?
And got a 4.2 with good credit
But will knock a nigga out on the set, with no flexing
You need to cut it like a O.T. Genasis collage
And focus on your swag like Spongebob when he pronounce salad
Don't even laugh cause it's not a funny matter
Searching for Francis, while tryna protect the pink matter
I just described the greatest movie that was ever created
Don't you forget it like Glenn Lewis, and don't you hate it
Go where you're loved and not just tolerated
But strangers tend to show more love and have you celebrated
Sad as it sounds, your enemies start to follow you
I had a convo with your mother, she said should have swallowed you

[Hook: x2]
To me, it's what I see
To you, it's what you do
MArkham Asylum where all them niggas be robbing
They might smile in your face but I'm promising you they plotting

[Bridge: x2]
Guess who's back in the motherfucking house

[Verse 2: You-C]
Don't make me take control like I'm Kendrick Lamar
And start bodying niggas like they smoked 100,000 cigars
The fucking Cancer, giving cancers to all of you lames
With the hardest intentions as you play the easiest game
How can you grow without struggle? There's no success without hustle
As I continue to jam deaf like my name is Russel
Shit, I'm disappointed in that corny line
But when your colonel, it's bound happen in a couple rhymes
I got the spirit and energy of a Busta Rhymes
But never been a buster like watching Arthur when off a line
I'm never off a line like Tony Montana
When he was high as fuck and gunned down Manny inside his fucking casa
And then his sister witnessed
And she was crying and screaming and yelled "we just got married" and he ain't even flinching
It's like the Lady of Rage could raid a dozen graves
And come out with a thousand Jesus pieces and never be saved
It's like playing a PS2 with no memory card
Turning the system off while playing, questioning what went wrong
Never switching sides like the styles Tr√© Melvin
Bars so hot, you need to measure it in Kelvin

[Hook:]
To me, it's what I see
To you, it's what you do
MArkham Asylum where all them niggas be robbing
They might smile in your face but I'm promising you they plotting
To me, it's what I see
To you, it's what you do
Hazel Crest, where the realest niggas don't rest
Little Kydd the tallest killer, shoot that nigga in his fucking chest

[Verse 3: Lil Kydd]
The trench-coated gentleman with reprehensible table manners
Angrily stuffed your head in the end of a Campbell's canister
(Use your noodle!)
Brethren drowning
Me and the You-C smother them in the blood of their publicist and their manager, nigga
Down is the only parameter
I sip my cup of Jasmine infused with the scattered ashes of your grandmother
That's why I spit so old school
That's golden buckles on my red low tops like I'm stepping on Tyrion Lannister
The game never consisted of thrones
I came here with a folding chair, I ain't gon' leave on my own
My toilet paper is porcelain, my toilet is chrome
I go harder than raw obsidian, I'm dropping some stones
See you can come to the open mic hella first
But when the nigga up front say, "random order", ask yourself, "is it really worth?"
You can be the most articulate in the business
And the one with the biggest Twitter earns a seat with the early bird
You can walk in the light of God's vision and still get burned
Take another look at your pigment and ask yourself is it really cursed?
(Word, word!)
I'm an animal clad in the newest fur
Blind squirrels getting a nut, bury it right inside the Earth
And thus I killed him
I'm a high-five into a cricket
Lifted wizard on his Raven Baxter game, respect the vision
Gathering batches of kids where I last imprinted you niggas in the earth
Like "meet at Tyrone's crevasse", see in a minute. (Bye!)
Trench-Coat Wizard
