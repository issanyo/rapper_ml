Zach is like the cat to fight to grab the mic
At the cypher night and rap it right
Cats that bite got loose screws, dude
They're half as tight so I smack the mic
Out their hand and I pack the pipe
I didn't bring a Bic bruh, better pass a light
Let's get high
Yo, I wanna rap tonight!
And slap me five if that was tight
I take aim at tracks, I'm the sniper to beat
The Huf shoes on my feet keep my cipher complete
I write rhymes in my room with rap on repeat
And get your hands up like a cab on the street
I drop jaws
Better call Fifty's physician
You'll never pull my card like a shitty magician
Studied and rejected sixty religions
Cuz all of em brought with some shifty traditions
Plus Popes throughout the past have made some iffy decisions
Like supporting Nazis, you with me? Then listen
I worship hip-hop
But a messiah been missing
So I grabbed a mic and Jesus Chrysler quickly was christened
He is risen
You can't see me like the Holy Ghost
I burn the kush and Corinthians, holy smokes
Yo
Raise the bar, I propose a toast
To my dream of doing damage from coast to coast
