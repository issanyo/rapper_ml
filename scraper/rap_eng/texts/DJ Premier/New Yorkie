[Intro: Oscizzy]
Pull up to the brib

[Jay Em]
Lets sipp

[Oscizzy]
You already

[Both Oscizzy & Jay Em]
Your fucking girl

[Hook: Oscizzy]
New York, New York, New York
Pussy niggas out here with the fuckin' talk
And you know that you all soft so you better start to walk
'fore we pull up in the horse and we light you with the torch

[Verse 1: Oscizzy]
I'mma kill a nigga racing in his hatchback
'till you fucking scratch that, send it to his snapchat
Reaching for the gat peeking through the knapsack so I get the last laugh coming from the gas mask
Of course I'll have his bitch blowing like a bag pipe
Know I get the cash right, I don't have to ask twice
All these pussy niggas squeaking like they mad mice, when we heard that mix tape and it wasn't even that nice
Word to moms, man this album's a sin since I lift the pen in my song kith and kin
True Religion, superstition, niggas spitting venom
When you out in the street move with intuition
And then they say that I'm the craziest in class still
It's all fun and games until you get your caps peeled
And if you starting jack with a high school quarterback, better check your underwear so you don't get a blister pack
All your man does in the gym is fuckin' jumping jacks, hit the sack when his faggot ass gets a heart attack
And brush his teeth cause he's got a little dental plaque from the cracker jacks that made his breath take you aback
