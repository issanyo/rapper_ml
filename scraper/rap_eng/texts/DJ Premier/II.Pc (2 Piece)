My definite dimensions / Have a perfect defenition / Fix your third ocular if you can't see the picture / I figure , I can figure out a couple routes just to spit this hot shit through the mouth / Gold child , time & date about the same amount / Put that shit in roman numerals , if you can't feel the style / This is my forbidden sound , catch these hot rounds / Heres a bottle for your drought don't pout  ; fresh out the spout / I often soften the cushion ; for these niggas Kush'Pushin / Let my shit hit soul like a pin in a cushion / If you can see what I see ; then my nigga don't get pushed in / My niggas keep me up , so like good damn looking / But this ain't where the book ends / Fuck these "chickens" & Oh yeah fuck the central bookings / They searching for niggas who crooking but shooting men for how they looking / Don't touch the kitchen, im not done cooking / Wang & Rap is my shits , they my book ends / So , keep it in mind schemes can cop the cream too / And don't fall for money you can be a fiend dude / Due to me i'll be in the same mood , gaining rep & fame too / Fuck that trap shit , thats what these motherfuck'n lames do / Can you see my angles ? / They about 47 degrees / For schemes , who can't see / Let me bless these / So unhealthy / Your tracklist screaming help me / I won't stop grinding til my fam eating healthy / WANG yall niggas asked for whoopings pass the belt please....
