[Intro]
("Fuck who did I offend, rappers"
"Sit back I'm about to begin")

[Verse 1]
Uh, ayo, sharp as a razor blade
With a sting, like a taser
This rap game is whack as I've known
Now I'm attackin' you clones with my lightsaber
Give it to you with that nice flavor
But you ain't welcome to my table if you disrespect my behaviors
Lately I've been stifling anger, I might go and fight a stranger
Put my life in danger for exciting venture
But now to the matter at hand, imma attack with a plan
Kill you in 2 bars, a couple jacks in my hand
Cause I'm sick of all this funny shit
Clowns have just been mumblin'
And trust me, I like some of it
But how bad is it gonna get?
How we let these toxic folks in?
Kids is poppin' oxycodone claimin' that they watches frozen
Probably have a hard time tellin' time then
I'm a sick repellent virus
Infected like some psilocybin
So let's be real like the Hill of Cypress
I don't understand half the culture
But my raps explosive
Braggadocios causin' pandemonium
With rhymes I jot, sick of all the negative talk
Time to leave my enemies outlined in chalk, man

[Chorus: Big L]
Why do I end up in so much shit?
I done came way too far to be calling it quits
Jake wanna lock me up, even though I'm legit
They can't stand to see a young brother' pockets get thick

[Verse 2]
Uh, ayo enough's enough, whack rappers out here making bucks
Imma call they bluff until everybody exodus
When I hear that trash I change it to another channel
Kids got hair colored rainbow, I'm here to come dismantle
That bullshit, put your flame out like a fucking candle
Some example I am of a decent guy
But there's a reason why motherfuckers I eat alive
Are sweet as pie like cherry
When I rhyme I'm ready to annihilate steady
Battle me, you'll suffer plenty
When I kill the motherfucker, he'll be grateful he's dead like Jerry
Scary, the skill I contain, ill in the brain
Chop your head off with a guillotine
And all I do is put the pencil to paper
Terminator, determined for greatness
Murdering stages and earning wages
Now time to finish my verse, sick with the words
Hit with a curse, it would occur to me that they expect courtesy
But I expect a check until I'm drowning in currency

[Chorus: Big L] 2X
Why do I end up in so much shit?
I done came way too far to be calling it quits
Jake wanna lock me up, even though I'm legit
They can't stand to see a young brother' pockets get thick

[Outro]
("What would you do if a vicious enemy
Suddenly started coming at you
Armed to the teeth and ready to kill you?")
