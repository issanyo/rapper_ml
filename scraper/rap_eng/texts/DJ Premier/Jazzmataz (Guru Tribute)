[Intro: Martin Luther King Jr.]
We’ve got some difficult days ahead. But it really doesn’t matter with me now
Because I’ve been to the mountaintop; I don’t mind
Like anybody, I would like to live a long life. Longevity has its place. But I'm not concerned about that now. I just want to do God's will. And He's allowed me to go up to the mountain. And I've looked over. And I've seen the Promised Land. I may not get there with you. But I want you to know tonight, that we, as a people, will get to the promised land!
And so I'm happy, tonight
I'm not worried about anything
I'm not fearing any man!
Mine eyes have seen the glory of the coming of the Lord!!

[Verse 1: Jay Electronica]
Boom bash dash
I had to break, I had to get away
Pack my bags, headed for Greyhound, it was a Monday
Time to start my mission
I felt that burning feeling in my soul, I had to listen
I had this re-ocurring dream from the stage in a suit with a fade
I had set the game ablaze and they threw me a parade
I stacked a little change and took my family out the caves
But I was trapped in a maze like a lab rat
And at the bottom of the barrel where they keep the crabs at
No Geico, no Aflac, nothing to fall back on
But the streets where niggas cussed out the police and sold they crack on
Better known as back home, where they treat the Arabs and the Spanish and the blacks wrong
There he go with that song
You may be tired but I spit what I'm inspired
From the Lord of the worlds cause the devil is a liar

[Hook: Tone Treasure]
Say, I've seen the lightning flashing (yes I did)
And I've seen the thunder roar
But you can't (you can't keep me down for long)
Because I'm getting stronger (Because I keep getting stronger)

[Verse 2: Jay Electronica]
My style is like a shot of Jack Daniels, a baby grand piano
Lightening Hopkin, smokin' cigs, strummin' on the banjo
The son of man's the son of a gun with hella ammo
Sheriffs shootin' Bob Marley, John J. Rambo
Six sextillion, 19 million, the holy pyramids say we all Allah's children
Voodoo for the pilgrims who bring weapons and conceal 'em
They silence you with force and then indoctrinate the children
Yo Gabba Gabba, Ahmadinejad will blow up your apartment if you don’t observe the Sabbath
I look the devil in his eye and say abracadabra
Then drown 'im in the mighty light his brain couldn’t fathom
Scrappin' every day, just like fight club
A thriller and a smooth criminal like Mike was

[Hook: Tone Treasure]
Say, I've seen the lightning flashing (yes I did)
And I've seen the thunder roar
But you can't (you can't keep me down for long)
Because I'm getting stronger (Because I keep getting stronger)
