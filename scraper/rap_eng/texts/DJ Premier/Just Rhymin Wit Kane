[Verse 1: Just Ice]
Caution, red alert, time to do work
Mammy with the wet lips sipping on some crist'
And em over there, honey drinking belvedere
Smoking blunts everywhere saying peace to Premier
Yeah, ass shaking, get this thing popping
Ass for the taking, got that shit rocking
Bitches one side, niggas on the next
We thinking about cake, they talking about sex
I'm talking toasters and roasters, ain't always tryna pose
I'm getting closer and closer that gun push your nose up
Y'all feel, me feel me, even if you can't see me
From the streets to the beat, let it go, yo watch me freak
Okay, here's the final round
This is how it goes down
I got six loaded clips, sick corroded clips
Belvedere everywhere, Hennessy and the Cris'
We getting drunk and smoked out whole room getting choked out
Hydro and a flow, this bitch wanna toke but nope
Stay strong, nothing love of my team
The part I play is strong, but we got to get the cream
By any means we stay doing our thing
Motherfuckers so dumb they can't figure where it's coming from
They got school wrong, all they do is pull triggers
All they do: dig out bitches, some even digging niggas
What the fuck? The rap game changing everyday
Hard rocks walk away, now this shit is turning gay
All I say, you come hear it with me with it
You get your shit broke the fuck up your cap get twisted
I spit it Just Ice, colossus, immortal
Any time that I come I got some banging shit for you
So y'all just chill, sit back relax
That real motherfucker is back, that's a rap, gangsta

[Verse 2: Big Daddy Kane]
Look, I'm from the streets where them kids like clapping
Corner stores sell the midnight dragon, got right out the game and had to get right back in
Any day, shit might happen and that be on the real
Cats be on your heels, gats be on reveal
I got niggas that seen trial
I got some niggas about to walk the green mile up in the P now
Meanwhile i try to excel deeper, make my pockets smell sweeter
With cheddar spreading more than Velveeta
Make sure you flip the dough in the the 2 triple 0
Come through sip the Mo', I be that true gigolo
See me getting ass in the ride
Scrub style from the passenger side, you asking to die?
Shit, couldn't fuck with this on your best night
I scream let's fight, niggas turn transvestite and don't dress right
When the red light is pointed at your chest sight
You just might, wanna check your vest tight, nigga
