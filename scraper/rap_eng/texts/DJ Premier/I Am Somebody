"I'm MC slapping, machine gun action"
"I'm MC slapping, machine gun action"
"I'm MC slapping, machine gun action"
"I'm MC slapping, machine gun action"

[Intro]
Aha
Big Shug, DJ Premier
Triple OG in effect
Aha
I am somebody
But y'all already knew that
For sho'
Here we go

[Verse]
I'm the voice, I'm the truth, I'm the raw
I'm that step above the law
I'm the black, not the white
I was born on the wrong side of the right, and that's life
I'm the ledge, I'm the juice, I'm the Bishop
When I cut loose, bitch better move
I'm the heat, I'm the lead
I'm the passing through your goddamn head, for real
I'm the pimp, I'm the daddy
I'm the custom spoke rim black paint caddie
I'm the hood, I'm the making
Now let me see you dudes come and try to take it
I'm the real, state your course
I'm the black hearse, [?] that motionless corpse
I'm the fist, put it up in the air
And let me hear my people out there
I'm the break, the MC, the fact
To let you know that hip-hop is back
And what y'all know about the Gang Starr scene
What y'all know about repping for the team
And what y'all know about the Boston bean
DJ Premier, show 'em what I mean

"I'm MC slapping, machine gun action"
"I'm MC slapping, machine gun action"
"I dare you try to get the best of me"
"I'm MC slapping, machine gun action"
"I dare you try to get the best of me"
"I'm MC slapping, machine gun action"
