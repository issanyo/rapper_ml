[Chorus]
Ain't no other man can stand up next to you
Ain't no other man on the planet does what you do
You're the kind of guy, a girl finds in a blue moon
You got soul, you got class, you got style, you're badass
Ain't no other man can stand up next to you
Ain't no other man on the planet does what you do
You're the kind of guy, a girl finds in a blue moon
Ain't no other man it's true
Ain't no other man but you

[Bridge]
Ain't no other, ain't, ain't no other (other)
Ain't no other, ain't, ain't no other lover
Ain't no other, I, I, I need no other
Ain't no other man but you

[Chorus]
Ain't no other man can stand up next to you
Ain't no other man on the planet does what you do
You're the kind of guy, a girl finds in a blue moon
You got soul, you got class, you got style, you're badass
Ain't no other man can stand up next to you
Ain't no other man on the planet does what you do
You're the kind of guy, a girl finds in a blue moon
Ain't no other man it's true
Ain't no other man but you
