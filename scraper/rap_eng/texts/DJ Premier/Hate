"Thinkin' if I were to evacuate
You'd probably be straighter than straight
And wouldn't have so much hate"

[Sample: Scratches by DJ Premier]
"Have so much hate"

[Verse 1: N.O.R.E.]
Hate is a drug and most niggas love to use it
Addicted to it, so they abuse it
Hate from the heart, they hate from within
And not realizing they're hating their own skin
Only time I hate is when they hate me, I hate back
Talk behind my face but they won't say it to my face, black
I can erase that, drama chase that
Losing so long, about time for a victor
'Bout to change my name to Victor, that's right, it's Victor
It's already rock steady, [?] trigger
I did blow where the pimps go
I drink wine in the box, grind in the blocks
Fuck a wallet homie, keep guap in my socks
Queens, New York, Queens New York, [?]
Moving downtown right by Versace  [?]
Melvin Flynt dropped and niggas told me it's a classic
The reason I ain't like it cause I felt like a bastard
God's favorite, I felt like the hood's favorite
Besides N.O.R.E., that's niggas' number one
Aight fuck it, yeah nigga, that's my number one
Premier send us your beat, your turn, blow it
That's why I'm burn down in the bridge with Blaq Poet
And left rap, niggas living off in [?]
Bin Laden, [?]

[Hook 2x]
"I'm mad vexed, it's what the projects made me"
"Have so much hate"
"Most hated"
"True story"
"Have so much hate"

[Verse 2: Blaq Poet]
Yo, I see ya niggas, ya hating niggas
Scheming on the side, want to take from niggas
Trying to figure out how to make these figures
Rain, sleet, or snow, Blaq Po' delivers
I don't give a fuck, nigga, hate me
Cause God's the only one that can judge me
Ya bitch ass niggas ain't worth the hate
Plus I love to chop off the head of the snake
Some hate the fact that I'm still here
Still ill, still raw, still nigga don't care
Plus it ain't no debate
I'm the hardest, so why should I ("have so much hate")?
Ya motherfuckers better get it right
Too much hate, it's gonna be some shit tonight
I wish there was more love in the hood
But niggas love to hate more when you're good
That's the way it is, what it's gonna be
It's "fuck you" nigga, if it's "fuck me"
It's all about what you make it
I know niggas running around, heart full of hatred
It's no telling what they might do
They hate everything, but they would love to get you
In the hood, rock stars pack heavy metal
Give me a break, niggas, hating on every level

[Hook]
