"Got a, freaky, freaky, freaky freaky flow" - Jeru Da Damaja 'Come Clean'
It's freaky deaky
It's freaky deaky - Brother J

[Verse One]
My flow is stunning
Coming from where you would be running
The Dead Zone, get your head sewn the Evil Dead's home
Back from Sharom
Many moons
Are there any goons with flows that froze snows?
So cool, make a fool wanna duel
Can't take the truth, you got proof
See the nigga on the roof? Move slow
He already know, who you are so it don't really matter to me
The badder you be, the better for your rehabilitation
Strap ya down and slap ya 'round
Call ya "Susan", using, abusing
Methods, are nothing
You're so poetic, where does he get it?
I inherit, the gift of the gods, I don't lift a card
I break down stars, body gasp
You can talk fast and flabbergast most
But I freak flows from coast to coast

[Scratch Hook]

[Verse Two]
I got styles they study in sections
My interjections stun 'em, they summon someone
But they don't know
They made a show and wrote a book
But they don't look
So who you following they only borrow
From my [?], they don't know the cost
Or the cause
They just applause cause they hear the pause
I got laws against the offense of perpetration
Interpretation or termination
Sick of gimmicks, mimics and and mimes
Wack rhymes and them black on black crimes
It's outta hand how the man gotcha
Then they watch ya, thinking they got the answer
But they can't cure cancer
The real question, inciting aggression
In our seed
That's why somebody gotta bleed
Word to Reed
I got 100,000 niggas to feed

[Verse Three]
I push up on the mic like I'm turning on a light
You wanna fight? Step in the ring
Whatever kind of weapon you bring is fine
I got my mind set
Internet, now I'm in your assets
Ain't got shit and still making ass bets
Get on my nerve like pets
That's why, I support no beast
They bite the hand
Everyday I gotta fight the man
Ticket, stick it
In your discharge I'm this large
You'll get disbarred trying to diss fraud
Now my premonition is getting graphic
I'm stuck in traffic
Four plain clothes is aiming at my nose
Someone blows a horn and then they gone
At a red light I see a headlight
High beaming, am I dreaming?
Now I don't even know
Flashbacks is causing me to flow
