McKittrick: See that sign up here - up here. "Defcon." That indicates our current defense condition. It should read "Defcon 5," which means peace...because of those stunts you pulled

"Wow we got something"
"We're in"

[Verse 1]
This is music mimicking images
Vividness versus timidness
Giving what I've been living with lately can make you finish it
I've been waiting and plotting, we vacating your spot
Trey eight by the bulletproof wallet
I cook with Chef
Niggas shaking babies, shook to death
Wu-Tang Forever, they literally hooked on Meth
I Capadon' abracadabra
Strapped and wore prosthetic limbs
My co-workers are packing arms
Don't sleep without a job at the vet
And I only hustle hard just to rob my connect
Got a problem with debt
Can't resolve it with checks
Or evolve with the threats until I'm involved with a death
And I'm heavy in any and every area aware of me
Legends and lost souls only people compare to me
My energy
Size 'em and penalize 'em
By jeopardizing the rest of they lives as soon as I recognize 'em

[Verse 2]
Timing is perfect
Bound to resurface with the 4-5 on my person
Rhyme like it's urgent
Plus if the vibe isn't perfect I'm violent and nervous
All my people liable to burst this, survival is worthless
So my Daily Operations, spend my life high
Now my Moment Of Truth is my No More Mr. Nice Guy
You can favor odds, gotta play your cards
Autism flow, everything I say is hard
On drums, I got Primo drums and guns that's illegal
Was the plug of my people, we do it all
There's laws of the underground fool with the 100 rounds
Got something to prove? Homie we prove 'em all
Career investment, that's A.I.G
Got a strap on my sneaker like the A.I.3
So the way I see
Either harming me or honor me
My army be in harmony with armories in foreign seas
