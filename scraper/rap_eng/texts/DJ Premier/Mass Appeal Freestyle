Yea

[Verse]
Im bouta be goin off
I put on for my city
I got the mass appeal
Your girl, showin me her titty
Im really makin it fo' really
No milli vanilli
Make it illy when i machiavelli
Im chasin the fetti
You ready im ready to get it
No matter what the weather
Im better than ever
Im Jerry collectin' all the cheddar
You better prepare
Cause im bouta fire all of my weapons
You need to beware cause if
You fuck with me i get to steppin
Whatchu doin im reppin the 4-1-0
Been here a second
Get at me whenever
Yea my birthday is in late december
Dont ever forget it
You ain't better
This the armageddon
And im bringin the venom
I fed em forever
You fell in the trenches
I put in the work so i can pull all the wenches
Im never in benches
Im bendin dimensions
I pen up the paper then spit it
So i can get the mention
Did i mention
Im menace im used to being respected
I respect my elders
I expect the ones who disrespect
Will get ejected and rejected
Every single second
While im breakin records
