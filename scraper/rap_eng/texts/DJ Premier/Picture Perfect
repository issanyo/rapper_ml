[Intro]
Uh-oh, oh-oh
Uh-oh

[Bridge: Chris Brown]
You might've seen her on every cover
Of every magazine but can't nobody get her but me
Uh-oh, there she go, uh-oh, there she go
Uh-oh, there she go, can't nobody get her but me

[Verse 1: Chris Brown]
Hot damn, let me tell you man
She looks so good I'mma say it again
So good that I can't explain
When she do what she do, she's gon' do her thing
Over here Ms. Lane
Come on, get fly with a Superman
You ain't got to worry, I won't play no games
Baby tonight

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown]
So don't front, you know you wanna stay
It's all fun, so baby come and play

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
It's picture perfect, the way you work it girl
What's your purpose? Cause I deserve it girl, ohh
Before we get into something crazy
All you fellas back up off my lady
Get you one cause I got that one
Get you one cause I got that one
Get you one cause I got that one
Get you one cause I got that, got that
It's the way she wears her clothes, the beauty overload
The definition of a star (wanna meet her?)

[Bridge: Chris Brown]
You might've seen her on every cover
Of every magazine but can't nobody get her but me
Uh-oh, there she go, uh-oh, there she go
Uh-oh, there she go, can't nobody get her but me

[Verse 2: Chris Brown]
Damn girl set my flame ablaze
Top model chick from my favorite page
At the same time form around the way
When she break it down she gon' do her thing
After the beat drop
You can hear the bass from the parking lot
You ain't gotta worry you won't tell me stop
Baby tonight

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown]
So don't front, you know you wanna stay
It's all fun, so baby come and play

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown]
So don't front, you know you wanna stay
It's all fun, so baby come and play

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
It's picture perfect, the way you work it girl
What's your purpose? Cause I deserve it girl, ohh
Before we get into something crazy
All you fellas back up off my lady
Get you one cause I got that one
Get you one cause I got that one
Get you one cause I got that one
Get you one cause I got that, got that
It's the way she wears her clothes, the beauty overload
The definition of a star (wanna meet her?)

[Bridge: Chris Brown]
You might've seen her on every cover
Of every magazine but can't nobody get her but me
Uh-oh, there she go, uh-oh, there she go
Uh-oh, there she go, can't nobody get her but me

[Verse 3: will.i.am]
Hot damn I got the hottest chick
She gotta be a goddess, her body's sick
3D booty like holy shit!
She's holding them Angela Jolie lips
(Hold up!) With the tig ol' bits
Willy get whipped when she wiggles it
She jiggles it, my stick gets stiff
Make a brother think she's a hypnotist
Cause she hypnotize
Brothers gon' trip when she arrives
Looking like she fell out the sky
Heaven's missing an angel, guys gonna cry
Cause she's, chilling, with, me
I, am, Willy in love with Double D cups
And she stack plenty
Just need one, I don't need many
She loves me never money or pennies
Look if you want brother, you ain't getting any
That's mine, yep yep, that's right sonny
Get you one cause that's my honey

[Outro: Chris Brown & will.i.am]
Get you one cause I got that one (yeah)
Get you one cause I got that one (yeah)
Get you one cause I got that one (yeah)
Get you one cause I got that, got that
It's the way she wears her clothes, the beauty overload
The definition of a star
Get you one cause I got that one
Get you one cause I got that one
Get you one cause I got that one
Get you one cause I got that, got that, got that, got that
Got that, got that, got that, got that, got that
