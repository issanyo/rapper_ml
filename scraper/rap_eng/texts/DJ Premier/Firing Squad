[Hook x2]
Firing Squad
Ain't no telling what they might do
Firing Squad
Yo them niggas will invite you
Firing Squad
To the battlefields so they can wipe you
Firing Squad
That's them niggas that don't like you

[Verse 1: Billy Danze]
Everybody hit the floor
Aw shit not again, don't flinch
All F A G emcees play the bench
You drop jewels, we just cruised on your maggot ass
Now make a move and we'll squeeze tools at your faggot ass
Now, guess who's, back in the place, kid I missed M.O.P
Hey I'm sorry you had to wait G
In '93 you barely heard us in the crowd
So we eject from select, and now our shit is bumpin loud
Firing Squad, back on the case
To school ya, turnin more boys to men than the great Luke Dubra
BOOYAH! Do ya, plan to, stand and prove
Remember I got love for only a handful
That's [Danze] architechting the game plan
To bust down your levels, I've already smacked the shit out your main man
I don't think you want no static C
Automatically, automatic G's, bump somethin

CHORUS

[Teflon]
Count your blessings, this meltin' Smith & Wesson's in a hurry
The more grounds I cover the more brothers to worry
Everlasting, got a certified passion for blasting
As(k)' 'em I never show guns but I'm still an assassin
Yes some say my rap's about to crack the afterbirth
Up out the verse, send the whole entire earth into a blackout
Here's the facts about my M.O.P. click
We get down, roll in deep waters we drown niggas and leave 'em seasick
Yo let it be known, we own the Marks
Up on the hill we own the thrones, we own the parks
For real, we own the loan sharks
Niggas practice what they preach and back with what they reach wit
The ill part is on the mic I be kickin the freak shit
Said it, violators get beheaded, rumors we dead it
Amazing how we plays, close the show, and roll the credits
It's over, straight from Saratoga, said these niggas better recognize
We exercise, our lyric, something deadly

[Hook]

[Lil Fame]
[Take it to the streets] Watch niggas collapse
Perhaps, we could bust raps or bust caps
[THIS IS] ghetto hell we in, and if it's beef
You tell me and these vill-i-ans will go to war like Israelians
Once I catch ya, I'm guranteed to get ya
Duke, I bet ya, you leave this piece on a stretcher
Ain't nothing to kid about
I put one in your wig and bounce
Leave the rest for the autopsy to figure out
Now, who's that nigga that's tryin to take my spot
New jacks in rap must pay dues before they rock
Yo I run shit like Mr. Harper, because I'm proper
And I rip raps like crackheads strip copper
Partner, it's bug, fake thugs don't get no love
You could easily get got by hot sinking slugs
Nigga what, I take your pride and slide
And turn a rap cipher, into a motherfucking homicide

CHORUS
