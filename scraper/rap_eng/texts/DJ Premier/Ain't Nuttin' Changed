[Hook x2]
[Akon Samples: "Blaq Poet"]
(When I come to the hood)
You know what's poppin'
(Ain't nuttin changed)
You know what's on

(When I come to the hood)

[Verse 1]
It's like woooo-aaahhh!
Ain't nuttin' changed 'Po whatchu gonna do man?
We still gettin' money, bitches still actin' funny
They wanna hold somethin, can't get shit from me
I'm back on the block, passin' the rock
Got my young squad, you don't want 'em bastards to pop
Rhyme veteran ready to get it in
Way before fif I was hated by many men
When I come to the hood, you know I'm creepin'
Leave you leakin', missiles heat seekin'
Nuttin' to talk about, fo' pound in your mouth
New York in the house, I dare you to walk it out
Straight menace, fight to the finish
Niggas get demolished, diminished I mean business
Millionaire rappers still wanna envy me
They wish they was mini-me, I'm sick on any beat

[Hook x2]

[Verse 2]
Niggas need those
I'm on a hill, where all the fiends go
Big bottle of yack, the big gat
Niggas fall back, I got the biggest crap
And when it's time to go, I go hard
Fuck the police they got a job, I got a job
Ain't nuttin' changed, except the weather
Except the chedda, except a nigga got betta
After all these years and all these beers
I got niggas still running in fear, why?
I ain't killin' nuttin', I ain't lettin' nuttin' die
Niggas know the repercussions if they fucking try
Shine up, stand up and a puffy eye
Besides that? Blaq Poet, a lovely guy
Run around have fun in the hood
Get love from my thuns when I come in the hood

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Ain't nuttin' changed
Niggas still pumping the rain
Things still come from the train
Still gotta tell them mothafuckas no change
Niggas still on the block, holdin' em thangs
Some disappeared like motherfucking Blaine
Some got hang, some comin' home, some in the zone
They all can't wait 'til I tell 'em that it's on
Blaq Poet army across New York
Ya'll niggas don't even talk, You done prim with a fork
Screwball disciples get at you
Niggas don't like you, baseball bat you
Or sit up on a roof, and snipe you
Miles away, 50 cal rifle
A real gangsta is good in any hood
A real goon comin' soon to your hood

[Hook]
