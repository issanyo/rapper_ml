"Is it fresh?"

[Verse One: Queen Latifah]
My mellow Latee was kicking flavors
The R.E. posse said "Yo Latifah we can do this"
So I paused and took a thought then my brilliance I caught
And I agreed because I already knew this
Now you should want to plex, cause I'm in full effects
Queen Latifah is five-oh on this set
You've been begging and dying for somebody's rhyming to set you free
For God so loved the world he gave you me
I'm coolin teaching those needing schoolin
And the mic, this mic in my hand, I'm ruling
So prepare your mind for my lifeline
And meet the new Queen of Royal Badness
Latifah has the spirit so head for the water
And dive into the wrath of my madness

[Hook: Queen Latifah]
Cost of living getting higher cause them to rhyme our way
Queen Latifah getting higher cause her to rhyme our way

[Verse Two: Queen Latifah]
Some MC's act bold and arrogant, vein
And using each other to compete with
These subjects I pity because their rhymes are not witty like mine
To write a rhyme so delicious you can eat it
There are those who like my taste, but don't consider biting
There's penalties for those who don't do writing, just be reciting
Everyone else's word that took a lot of thinking
It's not our fault your thoughts are shrinking
While mine are growing, yes you know like all the woman inside of me
Despite what you do or say, and even in spite of me
Brothers, catch my eye with little hijinks like eye winks
Dying to have a lover of my likeness
So release all your shyness, just call me "Your highness"
And dare to feel the wrath of my madness

[Hook]

[Verse Three: Defari]
Here comes the gauge
Eight shots ready, open the cage
I got the go ahead from Premier, we take the stage
I connect, I use the atlas as game time, not practice
It's ill
Remix feel, Wrath Of My Madness
Oh my goodness my nigga watch me do this
Lyrically the best way to mention me is the truest
People in shock like they just got socked
Or rocked by a round of AK shots that woke up the block
Defari's hot
No doubt about it
The type of nigga to pass on the wine and rather Royal Crown it
Touch down it
Champion material
Remember hearing Latifah in high school, eating cereal
Disperse lyrics like prescriptions at clinics
Ayo go bag this
And dare to feel the wrath of my madness

[Hook]

I scene is mine cause I took it
I took it for the money and I took it for the fun
Don't step up in my face, you don't want to feel the taste
Don't try and play me out, cause I am not the one
Brothers on my bra strap, sisters clocking my sound, why?
Because they wanna be down with the
Queen L-A-T-I-F-A-H in command
I supply the concept for you to understand
For those who want to bite, don't make me have to fuss
The only thing you get is the gluteous maximus
Suckers on the tip, you're loving me, you're leaving me
You wish that one day you could have this
Come on, you know the time, just be thankful for the rhyme
And get up on the wrath of my madness

[Hook]
