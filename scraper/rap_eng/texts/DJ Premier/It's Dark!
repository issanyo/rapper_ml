[String]

[Prod. DJ Premier]
Sing like Bilal!

[Verse 1]
Sing, rap, dance, kick
The beat hit and that's it
Where the fiends at?
Must be at the fields where the genius at
Must be the scene on the TV screen
That gets them clapping
Harder every time his persona gets the shine
Of the limest light
Tight jeans with a tint
Red, blue, and green see - the forest? Of course
The source of the noise is none other than brother
Sidd kid, resusci-tate him, Paid in Full, paid it to him
They saying that the world is at a new high, sigh
I'm afraid I'll shoot him
A little DMT, a defeated fiend seeing
Spaceships and stars, thinking his brain construe 'em

[Hook]
The darkness is coming x8

[Verse 2]
Turn the light up I gotta see it the product of comedy, oil wars and soy sauce
Boy if I saw what you saw se√±or, boy
I'm at the bleachers sitting
Just trying to fit in
Feeling like a mixture of Yosemite Sam, Bugs Bunny and Yogi Bear
Try and catch me bitch, wherever you at
You know I won't be there, I won't be scared
Savages smack me with a club, Bah Humbug!

[Hook]
