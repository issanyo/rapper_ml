[Intro]
Ugh
King DJ you feel me, but nah
R.I.P. to everybody that was gone this week
Regardless of whatever
It's real shit, yo
I said..

[Verse 1: DJ]
If it was fair out here
Then nobody would care
But I know that it ain't
Believe me cause i've been there
And everybody been shooting
It's cause their hands don't work
And everybody say they're real
But thats on April first
You dodged the law so many times
Until your luck is reversed
You gotta keep your head up
Before you fully submersed
And everybody top 5
Talking tough through their computers
Till you slippin' on the strip
And then you come across the shooters
Most of y'all just talk a lot
But y'all was never bout that action
Trynna talk it out while they was on your block, clappin
Starve together, eat together
Thats just how its supposed to be
He said that you my brother forever
Because your close to me
Grind together, shine together
Toast to you and toast to me
These snakes wear masks
And they good at faking loyalty
Same ones faking it like this my day one bro
Taking pics, its crazy how the next day you're unknown
Can't trust nobody just incase you thought you probably could
They'll use you till they out the hood and then they turning hollywood
Smiling in your face but they hate you, they're bad actors
Trynna take your place and replace you, they're back stabbers
I know the game from the first page to the last chapter
If the 9 to 5 don't work you change to card crackers
Same dudes you used to jump in the pool with is car jackers
They know the trapping life is a trap but they all trappers
Hustled backwards, now they come up with nothing like snack wrappers
You was cool in school but after i'm getting the last laughter like damn homie
To win in this life you need a plan homie
Women wanna be wives they need a man homie
One day you gotta grow up to understand homie
I could teach you a lot
Whether you my people or not
All this snow on the streets
You should bump my heat through the blocks
The real is all that i speak
Whether you believe it or not
(but yo, it's real shit)
You gotta live this life to learn this life (uh huh)
You gotta show respect to earn it right (right)
You gotta give it up to earn your stripes
Something light, get it

[Verse 2: NaSmoove]
Yo DJ
Tell them that real shit
This other track we did
Will have these niggas on some chill shit
For real shit
But this song about that kill shit
You think i'm scared of opposition
Not even a little bit
Ruthless
I swear my guys be on that troop shit
Claiming that we beefing they see me and never do shit
I see these niggas mad cause i'm on my new shit
New born, don't fuck with it i give two shits
This what we do we see your crew and we start shooting
Rip up your resume`s my team is not recruiting
On the corner every day, no prostitution
Fuck the judge and my A.O. no prosecution
NaSmoove, Nazo, call me what you want
I come through with my bros and all we do is stunt
I'm smoking on a blunt, i'm higher than a punt
Creeping with a uzi got me on a hunt
Chasing money, taking money call it fast cash
Since niggas outta line I copped the flash pass
Bullets flying, people dying when I flash past
From the home of them shooters out in new baghdad
A.k.a. new brighton mother fuckers better recognize
All the colors in my charm will leave you mesmerized
I never take the stand, ill never testify
My film is rated r it can't be televised
(i'm different)
I swear to god i'm different
I'm really with the shits
Can't stay the night i'm only visiting
Gods christening
I swear I play for better christmases
This non-membership will leave you dead
If you ain't listening
Caught 'em at the light
Dragged him out his 6 cylinder
He wasn't acting right
His brave-heart wasn't big enough
Just had to hit em up and zip him up
Man I ain't give a fuck
My city real as fuck
This an example how we gives it up
Always gripping up, home court and y'all the visitors
I'm trynna switch it up from time to time my flow is sick as fuck
You can't sit with us if you ain't trynna get your benjis up
I gotta get them bucks and move my family out and live it up
(Woo!) It's NaSmoove man
