Straight outta the BPT
The kid from the 203

[Verse 1: WTG]
Out from the kitchen, another victim of what I'm kicking
Kicking and spitting, spitting so hard, don't know what hit them
And when it's written, fake G's the glove is fittin'
See you resenting, your time is up, that's end of sentence
The moral of the story
Even if it has to be bloody and gory, restore rap to its former glory
I'm pouring out a 40, for all the dead homies
We shooting like Kobe, I mastered being the master, Obi
You wouldn't wanna see me under the street lights
When we fight I make new adjustments like a rewrite
187 on you cus it's a G Thang
And G's moving in silence, specially on East Main
White on White forces with the straps so you know the deal
Nike Air up on the back so you know its real
And if you ever try to tell me I don't hone the skills
I'll pull up in your hood and make sure that I'm known to kill
And all the memories locked inside of your dome will spill
I'm spazzing out, yeah my team and I ain't so known to chill
B$B gated community, boys is peeping in it
Only time I lie in the studio's when I'm sleeping in it
And I spit till I got cotton mouth
203 State of Mind, the boys will tell you what Im talking bout
I clap a man if he talking out
I heard you trying to battle, you might as well bring your coffin out
Ain't no substitute, it's W
I'm a trouble dude, if you talking reckless then we'll come for you
East Sider with an attitude
Send shots to ya body, ya mans and em, they can catch em too

State of mind, 203 State of Mind (2x)
