[Movie Sample]
"I learned something from these two men. I learned to give love and get love unconditionally
You just have to accept people for what they are. And I learned the greatest gift of all
The saddest thing in life is wasted talent."

[Verse 1]
Dear diary your presence is felt
You inspire me to write about these demons inside of me
And express violence, but really that's an expression of self
It’s me dealing wit the cards I was dealt
Nobody believe in me, I’m not sure I believe in myself
Got all this pain in my veins, so when the fat lady sang I hope she sound like Adele
You got a problem with me or my team I’ll see you in Hell
Where the demons dwell, on your knees screaming for help
I've been slipping through the mud
Thinking about death because I’m not living it up
Giving my all but it’s neva enough
Most niggas in my position are driven to fuck up, I seen it
Most sluts get knocked up before they're sixteen and because they beliefs they keep it
And shatter their dreams before they even conceive it
R.I.P. to Christopher Rios and Pac, you not here but your spirit alive
So I’m on the rise like my life's compromised
You talking crime, stop it 5
I’m dropping bombs and ending the world like the mayan’s prophesized

[Hook x2]
It’s like I’m living in a day dream
That’s why I keep my diary closer then my enemies (never pretend)
I’m just trying to be what I was destined to be
And steadily shine until I die, I hope y’all remember me

[Verse 2]

It was all a dream,I used to hide Playboy magazines
Caught in my misery, and now I’m making history
Using my mind like Einstein
Trying to find time to connect my rhymes like Wi-Fi
I can’t sleep in the nighttime
Because these daydreams make me crazy
And praying to a damn god is NOT gonna save me
Insomniac, never awake, never asleep
When I blow trees I smoke half, it’s like me, incomplete
Trying to rise from the quicksand, from the land of broken promises
Hearts cut open and the thrown with the rest of bones in my closet
To die and sleep perchance to dream, of Shakespearian dramas
My heart weeps, surgeons  couldn’t cover the scars from karma
Caught up in the cold world full of lost souls with no shot of return
So call me absurd and I’ll respond wit the bird
Because honestly i’m not that concerned with this that and the third
Respect is earned so after this shit tell me what I deserve

[Hook x4]
