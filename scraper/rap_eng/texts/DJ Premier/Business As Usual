(samples?)
In my lifetime
I did it all i spit it t' all right rhymes
But not quite like mines
I break heart rocks down to minerals
Don’t believe what you read
Niggas lie in interviews
And I can lie ? up with criminals
Got the ladys say 'ey you is a fly ass nigga you
And I'm a south Bronx general
I put your face on the wall
Next to candles on the floor
Nigga I' been around in the world and back again
I know it ain't no rerun  but they wanna know whats happening
They wanna know if I make their soul clap again
If that’s your question call me Allen Iverson

Move like gambino they think I got ties to them
I introduce shit to gotti puff the brown like bobby
Fuck around watch your body be found in the lobby
In the intercom I'm hot like winter 's gone

First BO than  big L now kid is gone
Goodfella for life inspired when I sing this song
You know the words sing along
With the king and kong
Emancipate the niggas trying to get my linking on

(scratched HOOK )
Once again by popular demand
Showbiz and AG
What's the deal now you know that’s how we roll
It's business as usual
We killin' this fat beat

Once again by popular demand
Showbiz and AG
What's the deal now you know that’s how we roll
It's business as usual
We killin' this fat beat


I was born prince pop left from a king with a dream
Make phantasy reality before 19
My team like steam
Shit I' blowing this real
Going through your research
Fuck around put me first

A spitta ? G Dilla rezz his soul gave his life for this hiphop shit
You don’t hear me yo
Hear me flow now is like a breath of fresh air
Wondering how you got better after all these years
All these tears lead to pain pain make great music
Fuck it to ? show I hate sucied
Speak to gospel slave music
One in the same a lords messenger
That’s why they arresting us to mark us
They know the power we posses dog
And they know they posses us

A trunk full of PCP headed to DC
My homie got a spot we can double o pc ?
GD on my arm god injected
The dirt into my blood and now I'm infected
Who you think is really respected me or you
It’s a mismatch like 3 on 2

R Kelly you bitch ass I pee on you
You probably like it in your face
Faggot nigga could have start on will and grace
Weird ass weird ass I’ll yank your bitch
When kelly rollin' rollin' in my sheets no that ain't a diss
I stay away from this groupies
This bitches don’t know how to act
When they eyeing this stars like bootsy
Calling smoke trees ralling ? carry the hook
I ain't gotta lay you down
I just carry the chalk
