I gotta hold down the city
Gotta let you know where I come from
I gotta hold down the city
Gotta let you know (let you know)
I gotta hold down the city
Gotta let you know where I come from

[Intro: Papoose]
Papoose there

[Verse 1: Papoose]
Did all my laps in the gym, the sweat ran off my skin
They thought I ran out of breath but I was just catching my wind
That only happens to them, I gotta capture my win
I practice 31 days a month and I practice again
Was born equipped with sportsmanship so I just laugh and I grin
Victory is my objective, I don't have to pretend
Spread my wings like an eagle and let them flap in the wind
No guts, no glory, no pain, no gain, these are actions of men
My teammate is a warrior, got my back 'til the end
My offense is God-sent, you gon' have to defend
My crossover is vicious, I got more swagger than him
Hit the bottom of the net or the back of the rim, uh
Your style is a flagrant foul, your score, I'mma take it down
All of your trash talking was pointless, say it now
You're slacking and goaltending, my actions are bone-chilling
Got the home court advantage, I'm back on the road winning (road winning)

I gotta hold down the city
Gotta let you know where I come from
I gotta hold down the city
Gotta let you know (let you know)
I gotta hold down the city
Gotta let you know where I come from

[Verse 2: Papoose]
I gotta hold the city down, anyhow, they gon' have to really bounce
Totally dominate the game in front of any crowd
I keep it 100 while you only keep it 50 thou'
I can conquer any style, victory is in me now
My time is now, who said it was later?
It comes natural, I got a competitive nature
Look at them guys when I'm coming, they be hiding, I'm hunting
Luckily, they've been ducking me, you see lots of them running
Challengers, I embarrass 'em, they a dime and a dozen
Full of fire just like a dragon straight out of the dungeon
I'm just rising above it, you just lied to the public
I serve a purpose, you nervous with butterflies in your stomach
Don't try to intimidate me, you couldn't scare me, will it?
I'm spontaneous, smart, dangerous, fancy and quick
My trainer told me to work, he ain't prepare me to quit
I'm the only captain who's sailing this champion-ship!

I gotta hold down the city
Gotta let you know where I come from
I gotta hold down the city
Gotta let you know (let you know)
I gotta hold down the city
