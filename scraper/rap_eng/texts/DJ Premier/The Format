[Intro]
I'm ready...

[Verse 1]
You know the chronicles, the shit that if mama knew
The stress the drama do, the TEC's phemonenal
Rapid fire, it pecks through the abdominal
You bastard liars, it's me who's the honorable
Bathed and clothed up, shaved and close cut
Restraint from temptation was drained from both nuts
Heh, now in the physical form
Verbalize through the scriptures, I was Biblically born
It's I'ah, Jeremiah conceived through the blunt fire
On Kawasaki's, can wheelie up on one tire
Well respected, jail connected
Got the method for the pretty females perfected
For sure, very few flaws, heavy Chevy two-doors
Candy paint it'll give a nigga the blue balls
Pause, this the life I chose
Done did the 360, the cypher's closed; c'mon!

[Chorus: scratching by DJ Premier]
The format is real sickening, contagious
Here I come, AZ, there you go
Still I don't have to run no game, I done those things

[Verse 2]
Young and gifted, my tongue's prolific
In the beach bungalow is how I brung in Christmas
For the streets I'ma flow from the hungriest districts
Swiss kicks, crisp when I come to them picnics
Play slow, paper chase stack and lay low
Range Rove tinted, all black, the same old
Psychic mind, righteous rhymes
That turned a new leaf on my life of crime
No concerns with new beef, who's as nice as I'm?
It's confirmed, from few feet I'm still a sniper blind
Built my fame, spilt my pain
Politicking daily, still trying to milk the game
It's obvious that I'm real, rap skills remain
I took some change and I'm still the same

[Chorus: scratching by DJ Premier]
The format is real sickening, contagious
Here I come, AZ, there you go
Still I don't have to run no game, I done those things

[Verse 3]
Learnt the system, burned some izm
Jotted my jewels down like journalism
How I maneuve now, it'll merge the wisdom
A pilgrim, prophesize putting words to rhythm
Relating, I Adam Clayton it, manifestation, patient
Meditatin' with them animals waitin', pacin'
Like an inmate that sealed his fate
Let some years escape, but I'm still in shape
I'm chilling, deeply rooted, a beast with music
From Bed-Stuy to the East, I'm too at peace to lose it
But love it, I still does it, breathing off a Trump budget
Fresh out of Bloomies with the Louis luggage

[Chorus: scratching by DJ Premier]
The format is real sickening, contagious
Here I come, AZ, there you go
Still I don't have to run no game, I done those things
