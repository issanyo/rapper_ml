[Verse 1: Pat G]
12 11 97 my life is testament
But you can call it an investment
I wonder where the rest went
Because I'm taking contestants
Educated at my age I understand that there's questions
Life is a blessing although some are not as lucky
Teach you some lessens when I'm feeling funky
Took time to take the truth you've-
Opened your mind to my groove
Still have so much left to prove but I'm determined to get it done
Priorities straightened out and don't forget son
ONE
Your worth is really nothing like a dollar
TWO
Your cash will make most girls holla
THREE
Develop your wealth as a scholar
FOUR
Add to yourself and stack is taller

[Chorus: Pat G]
It's not free
You can see
Better be
The Money
I'm Pat G
You know me
Need to see
The Money

[Sample: Mos Def]
For the modern MC, i.e. the blue collar worker

[Verse 2: Pat G]
Saving up my change so I'm boutta buy a bank
Make a living off these fans when that happens I will thank
You, I should sue those who think they shit don't stank
Ask 'em for a verse and they left the page blank
Hope my career doesn't tank
Living large but not Titantic
Record a couple hits now my ego is gigantic
Nah, miss me with all that shit
If I'm not real with myself then my throat you should slit
Might be a little harsh but they just don't get it
Wealth doesn't make you better that's right I said it
Don't get me wrong it'd make some worries go away
No wonder I stay in the lab, working every day

[Chorus]

[Bridge: Pat G] x6
And everybody say
'I'm about to stack it up'

[Verse 3: Pat G] x2
And when my paper is up
You know I'm tryna get down
Come and say 'what's up' when I'm rolling through your town
My feet on the ground but I feel like flying high
I feel like Kweli rapping just to get by
