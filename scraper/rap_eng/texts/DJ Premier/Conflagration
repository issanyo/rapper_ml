Verse 1:

I spit harder than speech impediment
Kill you with intelligence call that death sentences
H Town the residence, the best I got evidence
Writing bars all day, all night, fuck some restlessness
Cause sleep, man that for the weak
Burn a few down, it's making my lungs weak
Burn a few more, now I can't even speak
But the thoughts up in my mind complex and so unique
You've reached, the peak of your career
If it ain't done yet imma end it right here

Chorus 1:
My styles impetuous, pretty much a death wish
Fuck around with me and ill leave you next to my next bitch
Always keep em guessing, that's not how it should go
Lets try to use our flow to educate, woah

Bridge 1:
Woah, set the tone, woah

Verse 2:
I can't believe these dancing ass dudes get famous
The type to make one hit, up on the party playlist
I be spitting real shit and ill always be paid less
If I'm beat by the game, noo working at pay less
No disrespect, to those who living check to check
But its all cause and effect, in the end get what you get
And imma be the best, first I gotta hit the net
Gotta spit it with my chest on a round table quest
Chillin high like birds in nest, with only one request
I need women, weed, and weather, oh and music how could I forget

Bridge 2:
Just call that shit HiiiPoWeR
When you gon' realize that that
The world is ours

Verse 3:
If you need cleansing take a shower
Others save time for the lord, even if just an hour
So take time and learn the power
Master it, climb to the top, and then fucking devour
I'm seeing your reaction why so sour?
Is it cause I'm bitter sweet, I'm killing these fucking beats
Or is it cause I took defeat to someone on they own damn beat (shout out preem)
Damn man, but that ain't gon' stop me, you are just inspiring
And I may not spit fire but I'm pouring out the gasoline
Watch what the magnum bring
Yea, I said but that ain't gon' stop me, you are just inspiring
And I may not spit first but I'm pouring out the gasoline
Watch what the magnum bring
I go bang the game conflagrate

Chorus 1:
My styles impetuous, pretty much a death wish
Fuck around with me and ill leave you next to my next bitch
Always keep em guessing, that's not how it should go
Lets try to use our flow to educate, woah
