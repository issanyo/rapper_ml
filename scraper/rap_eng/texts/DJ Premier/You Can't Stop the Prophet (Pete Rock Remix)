Guy 1: Ohhh! Yo look towards the darkness

(The Prophet)
I, leap over lies in a single bound
(Who are you?) The Black Prophet
One day I got struck by Knowledge of Self
It gave me super-scientifical powers
Now I, run through the ghetto
Battlin my, arch nemesis Mr. Ignorance
He's been tryin to take me out since the days of my youth
He feared this day would come
I'm hot on his trail, but sometimes he slips away
Because he has an army, they always give me trouble
Mainly - Hatred, Jealousy and Envy they attack me
They think they got me
But I use my super-science and I twist all three
I see sparks over that buildin - they're shootin at me
I dip, do a backflip
Then hit em in the heart with sharp steel bookmarks
Ignorance hates when I drop it
But no matter, what he do.. he can't stop the Prophet

(Deceit)
Yo Prophet, yo Prophet, c'mere real quick
Yo I just saw Ignorance downtown, let me put you on

(Girl #2)
Word, he down there buggin
He got them illin out, they shootin and everything else..

(The Prophet)
Let's continue the saga, mad mad drama
I met this chick, she said she knew where Ignorance was at
I said, "Where?" She said, "Downtown"
He had babies havin babies - and young niggas sellin crack
I think the bitch is lyin, it's a set up
I can smell it, but Ignorance is runnin rampant
Aight baby show me the exact spot
Meet me at Hoyt and Schermerhorn at 3 on the dot
So I hops up on the A-Train, I'm bein followed
My seventh sense senses danger
I turn around, it's Anger
And he brought a mob along, it's the same old song
Despair and Animosity got broke with the swiftness
I don't know what they think this is
I feel a sharp pain in my neck now I can't see, I'm like Hiram
They hit me with the dart filled with the pork chop serum
I tried to hold on but before long I dropped
When I awoke I was locked in the barber's shop
Trapped in the barber's chair
Oh no, they're gonna try and cut my hair
But that can't stop the Prophet

(Anger)
Yo Prophet!
Ignorance is tired of you followin him around
We about to put an end to that RIGHT NOW
Anamosity (YEA!) Despair (YO WHASSUP?) Get him!!

{DJ Premier cuts and scratches: "Can't a damn thing stop me"}

(The Prophet)
A few minutes passed by, I hear a buzzin noise
It was that chick with some of Ignorance's boys
She said, "Prophet, we got you beat;
By the way I'm Mr. Ignorance's wife, Deceit
But enough talk; now for your hair cut.."
When the clippers touched my hair, they blew the fuck up
After the explosion there was no one left
Cause I know Dim Mak/poison hand/touch of death
My vision's still kinda blurry, but I see a clue
Ignorance is at the library
I hurry, with lightning speed like The Flash
He's at the big one, on Grand, Army Plaz'
When I get inside the doors shut and the lights go off
Damn, another trap
I hear a hissin sound, I smell a funny smell
I gasp, I can't breathe
Ignorance is laughin at me
Waitin on my downfall, but he can't stop the Prophet

(Mr. Ignorance)
Well Prophet
It seems like you're in a bit of a jam
I hope you can unstick yourself
Oh, and what you did to my wife, it was nothing
I have others
Hahahahahaha... hahahahaha.. hahahahahah...

"The saga continues!"
