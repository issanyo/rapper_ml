[Hook: Scratches by DJ Premier]
"Survive"

[Verse 1]
Saturday night in the crib chilling, watching the Knicks
Fourth quarter, up 25, Mel on his shit
Check an ad in my Instagram, scrolling through pics
Double D's, double taps, shit it is what it is
Type starving got a hand full of menus, got to get me a bite
Something quick, something cheap cause my paper is tight
Thinking Domino's, nah, something different tonight
Oh, what about the Chinese spot that I like?
555-7279
Let me get a half chicken, fried rice on the side
Shrimp roll, mad duck sauce, and nothing with swine
"Deliver in 10 minutes", yeah he'll be here on time
Forty-five minutes later, they was calling my phone
Answered it tight like "damn, son, what took you so long?"
Said "the driver at the door, bring enough for a tip"
"Too long, I ain't tipping him shit" *click*

[Torae talking during hook]
You know what I mean, see I wasn't doing shit, I'm looking through the peephole
It's not the normal dude
It's like, shorty like curvy and all that, hold up

[Verse 2]
Crack the door, into my surprise, delivery chick was a dime
When I ordered breast and thighs, I was thinking with fries
Opened it wide, "come inside, let me get you this bread
That's in the wallet in the room on my bed"
Walked to the counter, she put the bag of food on the edge
Walked to my room, looking back at it shaking my head
Thinking damn, wishing she was on the menu instead
Then the room door shut like "I heard what you said"
She was with it, I was with it, so off came the fitted
Like I was trying to deliver to you for a minute
I get it, now you're gon' get it, she leaned back, jumped in the sack
Undid my zipper, laid me down on my back
By an hour into it, somebody calling her jack
Non-stop back to back like "you should get that"
Said "it's just Ping, my ex, the black belt, dude is obsessed
He probably followed me up to your address"

[Torae talking during hook]
Yo what you mean, followed you to my address?
Like, like a black belt, like karate, like he nice with that shit?
Nah ma, you got to get the fuck out
Hold up, hold up, hold up

[Verse 3]
Kicked in the door, waiving the nunchucks
Bo staff and laughing, dude was type nuts
Tried to tell homie "I didn't know your wife was a smut
No need to bust in my crib all wrecking my stuff"
Seen his lips move, but he never uttered a word
About 8 seconds later, this is all that I heard
"You Torae, you must pay
Kitty cat you slay, now under the ground where you must lay"
Got in a stance, two ninja stars in his hands
Threw them both in my direction, blocked them both with the plant
Kept coming, I start dumbing, never been a punk
But dude a karate master, hit him right in his nuts
Screamed "ahh!", leaned forward, an uppercut in his jaw
Foot swept him to the floor and threw him right out the door
Peeped shorty at my sight, she asked if I'm alright
I said "it's to be expected, it's Saturday night"

[Outro 2x: Scratches by DJ Premier]
"Up from the ground up son, you get the picture"
"Up from the ground up son"
"A veteran, I flow like I'm young, what"
