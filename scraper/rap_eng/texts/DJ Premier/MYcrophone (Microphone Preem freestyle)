I'm tryna murder that microphone
Don't need a burner to snipe your dome
I don't like you clones, I'm not opposed to drama
So I do the opposite of Obama and strike you drones
Ain't about to listen to what you clones say
Was coming tree clouds our vision like road spray
Four elements, raw intelligence since the old days
Combining my joints over them five points of Old Sway
I am the furthest thing from okay
Feel like Chris Martin when I premier this cold play
Catch and run, don't stay, been in the right mood
To Jackson for his ice cubes like O'Shea
These little rap crews are so gay
Bunch of fruit at the bottom dudes, they heart pumps Yoplait
Fuck no I never sold gay
Been killing them for so long y'all forgot that I ball, I'm OJ
I don't know made up laws that you abide by
You on the business end of the babble, I'm screaming bye bye
This distorted view brought to you in hifi
To counteract the cataracts that hide inside your mind's eye
And I don't know what you groupies are on
I'll loogie your pond, your new baton and Louis Vuitton
You newly to bomb and your top 40 isn't equal
Just a list of people I am truly beyond
That statement's inflammatory, you made it exclamatory
Hazmat suits in my laboratory are mandatory
You fans are corny
You been stuck more times than a badass shorty with the fattest ass and a massive orgy
Back up off me I'm determined to fight
Til ya recognize it's the illest you ever heard in your life
Til they swear I'm killing with every word that I write
And they call me Darren Wilson for the way that I murder a mic/Mike
You are not ready, everything I drop heavy
Got heads nodding like Night At The Roxbury
But on the contrary you could get your squad buried
Had been known at getting pussies open like a popped cherry
Go chill with the thugs, you're still timid cuz
I exposed you, showed who the real gimmick was
What I spit kills critics yet they still giving love
Cuz I'm ill with it like spitting up some illicit drugs
So when is your turn to run? you should turn and run
Try to teach me a lesson but forgetting where you learned it from
Son fuck a burner, I don't need to burst a gun
Cuz if the truth hurts, every new verse is murder one

I just murdered the microphone
You never heard of this type of zone
Don't matter if I'm in this fight alone
Not meant to fall back against the wall and I'm right at home

I just murdered that microphone
I just murdered that microphone
I just murdered that microphone
I just murdered the microphone
