[Verse 1: Swami Netero]
I'd like
To get it right/
But I'm always going out
And getting faded every night/
I say it isn't right
But I ain't taking my advice/
I'm elated off the white
Inebriated off the sprite/
You might just say it's wrong
Cause I'm conscious of my flaws/
But don't do jack at all
Except expose them in these songs/
I long to chuck the bong
So I won't be hypocritical/
To cultivate my spiritual
But I'm gonna need a miracle/
For beer to make me irritable
Atleast in these conditions/
No food up in my kitchen
And noone around to listen/
Maybe I'm codependant
But tell myself I'm not/
Cause my ego's trying to block
My heart from getting ripped and squashed/
Cause it's happened a lot
So I've just given up/
I'll numb my feelings with these drugs
Instead of trying to look for love/
I've had enough
Of being lonely and depressed/
But everytime I think I found her
It just turns into a mess/
Forget the sex
I want my life to have some meaning/
I need someone to heal me
Cause my heart is slowly bleeding/
I guess the reason's
Cause I just want a family/
A wife who's understanding me
And kids to love emphatically/
Ain't had it in the past you see
But I ain't trying to blame noone/
Me and my three brothers
Always walking home and getting jumped/
But that was just life growing up
Later's when it got to me/
All I had was drug addicts
To help my mama father me/
And they can't do it properly
They're busy eating up the food/
Swore I'd never walk out on my kids
Just some other dudes/
No matter what I'm going through
I'm just gonna have to deal with it/
All this pain I'm feeling
Ain't going to have my children feeling this/
I'm always going to be there for them
I'll love them more than anything/
We're always going to be giggling
Be tighter than some skinny jeans/
For now I'll keep the imagery
And travel in obscurity/
To cleanse all my impurity
And heal my insecurity/
