(Verse 1)

Hit you at the dome microphone rhyme killa
Murder the beat then set you to lay next to Dilla
Focus and keep your ears open like Ben Stiller
Girls race to my balls like they name was vegeta
And im challenging the reefa
Supplier get me higher that it sets me next to Jesus
Another track murdered it up grim reaper
East side get more hampers than Brothel keepers
Haters telling me that I'm gonna fall off
I'm the rap God do I have walk on the sea to show off?
Doper than keys fluidly like Billy Joel
From the heart and soul lyrics are the ozone hole
Ask Pinocchio if this is flava to ya ears
Erection on the nose can't lie to the puppeteer
Ain't you get the memo, I'm the greatest even off my demos
Pulling so much strings you probably think that I'm geppeto
98 till infinity and beyond
Going to your region bounce till you bruise your joints
Mind is the weapon step aside or I'll reload
You pussy pistols pencil make me spit torpedo's
Lacking empathy get scared hearing my conscious
My tape is the warning sign that it reads caution
Hook)
Kick in the door waving the 4-4
All you heard is poppa don't hit me no more
Kick in the door waving the 4-4
All you hear is Steelo don't hit me no more (x2)
