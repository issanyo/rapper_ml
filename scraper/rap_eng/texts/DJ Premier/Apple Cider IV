My elevated conscious leads me where the clouds sit
Shrouded were the limits that I broke into a thousand little pieces
As my thesis tries to prove that I am unchained
Leaves me with the burning question who will love a lad in sane?
I'm on the outside. Beyond here lies a quiet little pip-squeak
I'll sit and drink some tea until the inspiration hits me
Now I'm geared up. Rolling like a bike on its 10th speed
Eliminating those who plot to overthrow my entries
Watch my steps close. Imitate my sound just like an echo
It's technical so pay attention close when i give say so's
Initiate the fullness that you feel after you've let go
Then open up to me to hear your heart just like a stethoscope
I'm grief stricken since the passing of Bowie
And even though he didn't know me It felt like that we were homies
I would like one day to have that same effect on someone else
But until then I'll spend my time by wasting it becoming shelved
Gone pedestrian. Incredulous of getting a progressive swing
My life and I's in constant competition like its wrestling
Sometimes it's got the strong arm but I flip over the pesky thing
Then pin it to the ground and have the ref count down the rest of 3
My success recipe is at an impasse when every single rhyme I formulate creates a syntax error
The wind latched on to a page that took a day to write
Dismayed my might, a faded sight as it blew it away
But its...not...so...bad
See I get it how I live it
Through a storm with the compassion I exhibit
With the limits null and void its time I osculate the pendulum
That sped up how I operate. The drop is too intense for some
Brush the cobwebs off the cogwheels in my head
To get the right side moving to produce when nothings said
Spit it tangible so you can feel what I present to you
Unless I interject with some pretentious type of spectacle
When less than full I feel the need to eat the current vegetables
Their brains are drained from trying to compute what I have said to them
I promise to behave but that is not a guarantee
Understood? Step aside, and welcome this calamity
