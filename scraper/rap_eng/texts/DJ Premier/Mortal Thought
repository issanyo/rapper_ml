[Intro]
You never will conquer the champion
You never will conquer the champion
Calm down my selecta
Adjust that treble right now adjust the bass
Turn it up, stop frontin', c'mon, turn it up
Alright, check it out ninety-three lyrics, here we go

[Hook]
I never want a jheri curl up under my hat
The woman in my bed has got to be strictly black
I never want money if my lyrics are wack
So I must, rock, the mic
I play only the reggae and I play only rap
I rock the African, the European, and Jap
Beneath I got to show you that I am all that
So I must, rock, the mic

[Verse 1]
Are you tired of lyrical liars, passing fliers
Wannabe MC's, but really good triers
Tripping over mic cords, getting you bored
A total fraud, this kind of thing I can't afford, so I
Pick up the mic and kill it ill it top bill it
The club is a skillet, where MC's get fried in it
You got beef chill it, blood I spill it
After seven long years of ripping the party and I'm still widdit
You call my name I don't think about suing ya
I come to the club with that Booyaka
Laughin' while I'm doin ya the crowd is booin' ya
Gimme one month, record for record on tape I'll ruin ya
Some likkle awl pon sound bwoy wan fi rule de city
His style is lookin pretty beats and rhymes are dibby dibby
Here comes the rootical ratical teacha
I'll eat ya defeat ya beat ya till ya stagger and ya teeth chatter
You'll be goin through convulsions as I flash data
Any rapper can be a decapitated rapper now what's the matter
You're full of more junk than a sausage
Let me show you what a real hip-hop artist is

[Interlude: DJ Premier]
"My posse from the Bronx is thick!"*

[Hook]
I never want a jheri curl up under my hat
The woman in my bed has got to be strictly black
I never want money if my lyrics are wack
So I must, rock, the mic
I play only the reggae and I play only rap
I rock the African, the European, and Jap
Beneath I got to show you that I am all that
So I must, rock, the mic

[Verse 2]
Of course yeah I'm the most brilliant recording artist in your life
Never have to repeat a rhyme style twice, precise
In a lyrical drought like water to your lips oh yes my lyrics will suffice
I'm nice, like beans and rice, I am delicious
Who's the freshest lyricist on the mic, you don't want to fuck with KRS is
Lyric for lyric, rhyme for rhyme, style for style I break you like dishes
Either you come fully correct or the lyrics you simply makin' wishes
We got no time for fake black leaders and dreamers blowin' wishes
Youse a fraud, I mean a fraud like in fraudulation
I know what it is, the crown of rhyme supremacy you're tastin'
And yes, before the flavor hits your greedy tongue
You get ripped up by KRS-One
Now, lyrics, somebody want lyrics, from the lyrical terrorist
Here's a little somethin for you all to remember KRS, and remember this
I am no pessimist, more of an optimist
Activist revolutionist, yes the hardest artist
And the smartest, Premier spark this

Beneath I got to show you that I am all that
