[Intro]
The real, the real
That's what's up

[Verse 1]
Something's changed
Surprised it ain't me
But i guess that i'm to blame
All we had was this
Unsigned mutual agreement
But it seems like that was game

[Bridge]
Talkin' fly, cause in your mind
You're way more than what you really be
So I'mma be, honest and, hope you do the same
Over time, emotions climb
You felt that this was more than a fling
But, we both know you'll never get a ring

[Chorus]
I won't apologize for keepin' it real
(cause that's how i feel, my baby)
Cause the whole time baby, you knew the deal
(you knew the deal)
I won't apologize for tellin' the truth
(tellin' the truth)
See, I'mma do me, and you do you
That's what's up

[Verse 2]
All this pressure cause, I'm not what you want me to be
But see, we ain't bound to change
Can't be cuffed
No need copping a plea
I already beat the case

[Bridge] + [Chorus]

[Outro]
The real, the real
That's what's up
