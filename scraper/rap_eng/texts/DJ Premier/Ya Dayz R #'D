[Verse One: Shiggy Sha]
I keep my New York fitted
Sittin' on 360s
A New York Giant, okay you can't miss me
Hip hop's a young man's game
Nah mayne
Just young when the Shig got fame, what really changed?
The shit callin' me, I ain't playin' cause I wanna
This my new hustle, I ain't playin' on the corners
I'm done with that, had a run with that
I'm in the booth motherfucker, yep the funds is back
Why get in where I fit in? Push my way in
Monopolize the game like George Bush and friends
The code of the streets, man what happened to that
I live the codes of the streets, I just happen to rap
I done been through the nonsense
Indictment to Johnson
But what I'm palmin' make more Sense than Common
Won't hear shit when Sha hit ya up
Coroners will pick ya up
Morticianers will fix ya up

"Ya Dayz are numbered"
"Stand tall, stick your chest out boy and be a man"
"Ya Dayz are numbered"
"Never the less"
"It's most real in my everyday life"
"Ya Dayz are numbered"
"Stand tall, stick your chest out boy and be a man"
"Ya Dayz are numbered"
"Never the less"
"It's most real in my everyday life"

[Verse Two: Panchi]
And bwoy me not romp so
Calm down talk slow
Hands out my face or I air the place
It's the rise and the fall
Drugs women and liquor
The book and the movie, all in one nigga
When I die, my request, the thing that I ask
Is bury me face down and critics kiss my ass
But have my cash get standard
You heard what I said
Look me in the eye, living it's the same when I'm dead
Support me y'all
Keep my CD in ya crib
If not, fuck around you me just see me in your crib
Pillow case full of goodies with a blicker to your wig
And back to the lab just to divvy up your shit
A heard headed real nigga, there's nothing you can tell me
I'm like X in Belly or Florian Feliz
A real live pioneer that you can rely on
C'mon y'all, new shoulders to ride on

[Scratch Hook]

[Verse Three: Shiggy Sha]
You know the last verse for ya might be the worst for ya
Drive by see ya, eeer, hit reverse on ya
That's hunger in our eyes, hear the growl in our stomach?
Yeah dogs we comin', make us wild out in public

[Panchi]
Don't tell me that's it's too hard for ya
This brand new bar
Even without Bobbito we Stretch our Armstrong
I can see while you stand there, you stuck and you stare
Cause the shit right here is ever so and rare

[Shiggy Sha]
NYG'z that new dope, I rap PCP
We hi definition, Blu Ray DVD
We gotta connect like the Internet

[Panchi]
New Round gon' move the stuff

[Shiggy Sha]
Ain't shit you can do to us
Except get use to us

[Panchi]
As you can see it ain't easy to do
But we leave the blueprints for you to walk in our shoes
G's, young niggas with our chest in the wind
Writing checks with our mouths our ass cash in the end

[Shiggy Sha]
And that's why...
