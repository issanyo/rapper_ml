(Y'all feel it?)

[Chorus]
I'm talking in my sleep
Where my shadows crawl out of me
With a blind eye and my mouth wide
I'm talking in my sleep
(Y'all feel it?)

[Verse 1]
Let the blinds fall
And the night is young
Unlock my vault
Full of secrets left unsung
And I fall deep
With you next to me
With my eyes closed
But my mouth goes
(Y'all feel it?)

[Chorus]
And I talking in my sleep
Where my shadows crawl out of me
With a blind eye and my mouth wide
I'm talking in my sleep
(Y'all feel it?)

[Verse 2]
I tell you I love you
And I try and stay true
But when I sleep talk you baby
You find out what I do
(Y'all feel it?)

[Chorus]
Darling I'm talking in my sleep
When my shadows crawl out of me
With my blind eye
And my mouth wide
I'm talking in my sleep
(Y'all feel it?)
I'm talking in my sleep
(Y'all feel it?)
