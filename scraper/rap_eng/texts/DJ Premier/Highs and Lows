[Hook: Royce Da 5'9"]
Hey there, music world, you've been keepin' 'em waitin'
(These are my highs and lows)
You've been deprivin' 'em of the real, been on a vacation
(No matter where we go)
If you ask me, all around the world, I think they sleepin'
But we ain't sang you a lullaby
(I got no love in my heart for the other side)
B-b-bye, bye, bye

[Verse 1: Royce Da 5'9"]
The streets said I'm either supposed to be in jail or dead
My uncle told me before he died to watch for these whores
Before I wake up in the bed in the morn'
Next to a horse head, prolly why I'm war-bred
Prolly why my self-portrait, should be a Porsche with bald tires
And poor tread, to symbolize my upward swim, uh!
Nigga, we ain't go to no NBA
All we know's to sweep rappers up to K
Lookin' like, I'm tryna rake leaves on a windy day
So leave me out of your kind of war, be hysterics
When's the last time you seen a carnivore eat a carrot?
When's the last rhyme you heard that had you trying to find your words?

[Verse 2: MF DOOM]
Such absurd verbs do not disturb blurbs
Slid to the curb, he's not the first herb written on a mirror
Blurred rap guys is buyin' by like flies on a turd
Preemo and Royce surprise 'em, eye-to-eye 'em, they scurred
Slur intended, demented, got some nerve
Got no patience and a little perturbed, you heard?
Guessin' wit' more questions than answers
Why they started rhymin'? Should've just remained dancers
It's better odds than countin' cards at the Luxor…
Carbon fiber, black mask, askin' what the fuck tux for
Deluxe war, to whom it may concern
It's too late to burn; DOOM; you wait your turn

[Verse 3: Royce Da 5'9"]
I remember bein' broke, playin' Little Brother out my mother whip
Now I got some shit look like the mothership
Now my little brother got my other whip
Havin' to return it back to me…
Is exactly what he think the meanin' of struggle is
People compliment my grind, they wonder how I stay this clean
Comin' from Michigan, you don't seem to age
That's cause I don't whine about the state of things
Hatin' on others'll get you old quick
So I just salute and let my flow switch
Takin' my shit to the highest of levels
Combinin' everythin' that I have developed since '99
My style just seems to get better and better and better
Hoppin' out the custom Corvette
The same hustle, ready for whatever
Not a mushroom, portobella
I'm a truth-storyteller, uh, uh, right on

[Verse 4: MF DOOM]
Grab the microphone like he smack a rapper iPhone
PRhyme time, time's up, dial tone, smile's on
Show your teeth, known by the wild prone
All getters, pile on, gone since child grown
On the count, check, you'll catch a pound next
Stop clownin' around for rec', no disrespect 'tended
Said it, I meant it
Before it's invented, get it, did it, spent it
Keep the change, he needs that receipt, thanks
MCs need franks regardless of street rank
Their feet stank, we never leave the beat blank

[Verse 5: Phonte]
Masterpiece theatre, we the no limit think tank
Love to hit the club with my nigga cause when we drank
He think he a pimp but he can't see that them three skanks look nothing like Selita Ebanks
Wake up in the morning like, "Gee, thanks"
Tigallo the polymath, Raleigh boy, rap game Rolly Forbes
Never with the same sound, crazy like James Brown on Polydor
Sniffin' cocaine off of a bodyboard
Quick to 86 your top five if he not in yours
Why so serious? What y'all melancholy for?
Against us you'll never score at all, nope
Never headline a tour at all
Y'all Flintstone chewables fuckin' with toradols
Now who you wanna call?

[Outro: KXNG CROOKED & Royce Da 5'9"]
I rap, I rap, I rap circles around 'em
I rap, I, I, I rap, rap circles around 'em
I rap, rap, rap, rap circles around 'em
This the difference between y'all niggas and real rap
I rap circles around 'em
PRhyme!
