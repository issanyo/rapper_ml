[Intro: Master P]
What's up, Game?
Pour out a lil liquor, for Jevon Taylor
Lil Drako, and JoJo
My brother Kevin Miller, Hot Boy, Lil Fred
All the real niggas man
Y'all hold y'all head up
Is there a heaven for a gangsta, gangsta, gangsta?

[Verse 1: The Game]
Let my nigga C out
Hotbox the 7 'til the smoke start to seep out
Got on chains like a slave in the deep south
Could've been Michael Jordan but I took the Master P route
Had to take the street route, niggas know what we 'bout
Hard to snitch when the Glock knock your fucking teeth out
And I just voted for Obama, nigga
But I'd still shoot you in front ya mama, nigga
Word to Michelle, got stripes like Gazelles
Pour hot sauce in the devil food, strike a match in hell
Skip that yayo just to tip that scale
My favorite stripper drive a Maybach, I tip that well
Fish tail in the Phantom with a chick that's pale
White America's nightmare, rich black male
Used to work at Foot Locker, had to use my brother piss
I got the job, but he got hit with the fifth

[Chorus: singer & Master P]
Is there a heaven for a gangsta, gangsta, gangsta? (I need to knooow)
Is there a heaven for a gangsta, gangsta, gangsta?
Heaven's in your heart
Heaven's in your heart, ooh ooh, oh
Heaven's in your heart
Heaven's in your heart, ooh ooh, oh
Is there a heaven for a gangsta, gangsta, gangsta?

[Verse 2: The Game]
I think so, but my blood still run cold
I'm tryin' to make my momma feel like Gabby's when she won gold
The greatest stories remain untold
As souls wither away, transparent in that gun smoke
I tell the story so my sons know
I believe there is a heaven for a gangsta, nigga, Pun know
Used to have to pump blow to make my funds grow
'Cause when them funds low that Uzi weigh a ton though
Catch me in the morning sipping champagne on Instagram
Funny how that chandelier used to be a ceiling fan
Funny how that Buick Regal, turned into a Lam
Funny how Lilly's grandson turned into a man
I look around out here, a bunch of little me's
Everybody tryin' to do it B.I.G., a bunch of Lil' Cease
And since Lil JoJo can no longer breathe
I'ma ask y'all for him, so check it

[Chorus: singer & Master P]
Is there a heaven for a gangsta, gangsta, gangsta? (I need to knooow)
Is there a heaven for a gangsta, gangsta, gangsta?
Heaven's in your heart
Heaven's in your heart, ooh ooh, oh
Heaven's in your heart
Heaven's in your heart, ooh ooh, oh
Is there a heaven for a gangsta, gangsta, gangsta?

[Verse 3: Master P]
My nigga dead, didn't make the team
Could've been the next ML King
Young niggas rolling with them triple beams
Cup full of lean, but why a nigga spilling dreams?
And the little homies dying over Twitter beef
Black president, niggas should consider P
It's a dirty game, nigga, when you got cash
Bitches don't holla when a nigga on his ass
And the pigs set the trap and they got C
I really know them motherfuckers wanted me
And now the world's scared of Chief Keef
He just a lil' nigga tryna eat
I remember bitch, '99 ('99)
Now it's 2012, I'm getting mine (getting mine)
Little niggas pay attention
All my real niggas know that I miss 'em

[Chorus: singer & Master P]
Is there a heaven for a gangsta, gangsta, gangsta? (I need to knooow)
Is there a heaven for a gangsta, gangsta, gangsta?
Heaven's in your heart
Heaven's in your heart, ooh ooh, oh
Heaven's in your heart
Heaven's in your heart, ooh ooh, oh
