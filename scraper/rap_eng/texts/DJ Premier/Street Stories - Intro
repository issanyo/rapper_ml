[Intro]
G15, 2016
Street Stories
Young Toronto, hit it

[Hook]
Street Stories
Novels on top of beats sold, that's how the streets unfold
Street Stories
Your nobody til somebody kills you, you and your boy killed too

[Verse]
Sorry it took too long to write this introduction
Had writers block and on top my brain wouldn’t properly function
Maybe it was the lack of sleep or the fact that I don’t eat
It’s not because I’m too broke it’s because I’m too cheap
But I couldn’t take it anymore
I took my ass to the store
Bought a box of hot pockets, ate em, and went back for some more
But as I got to the door, the clerk said I couldn’t enter
“Get the fuck away from here” came out his old grimy dentures
I responded “Fuck You” and I entered the shop
The crazy clerk jumped the counter with a fully loaded Glock
Suddenly, from under me, the floor started to give way
Fell in a pit and hit my head, couldn’t tell the time of day
The clerk fell in too, but the fucker didn’t shoot
Because the gun fell out his hand and hit the top of my shoe
Immediately picked it up, and shoved it right in his gut
Told him “no more sudden movements, or else you’ll be fucked”
I thought this gotta be a dream, I almost did something dirty
Heard a sound go off, it was my alarm clock, it said 7:30

[Outro]
(Gunshots)
Take that motherfucker!!
