Check out, check out
Check out, check out my melody
Limp Bizkit, bring it on

Special, you think you're special
You do, I can see it in your eyes
I can see it when you laugh at me
Look down on me and walk around on me

Just one more fight about your leadership
And I will straight up leave your shit
'Cause I've had enough of this and now I'm pissed

Yeah, this time I'ma let it all come out
This time I'ma stand up and shout
I'ma do things my way
It's my way, my way or the highway

This time I'ma let it all come out
This time I'ma stand up and shout
I'ma do things my way
It's my way, my way or the highway

Limp Bizkit
Check out my melody
Rock the house y'all
Check out my melody
Gonna feel y'all

Just one more fight about a lot of things
And I will give up everything
To be on my own again, free again

Yeah, this time I'ma let it all come out
This time I'ma stand up and shout
I'ma do things my way
It's my way, my way or the highway

This time I'ma let it all come out
This time I'ma stand up and shout
I'ma do things my way
It's my way, my way or the highway

Someday you'll see things my way
'Cause you never know, like you never know
When you're gonna go

Someday you'll see things my way
'Cause you never know, like you never know
When you're gonna go

Check out my melody
It's all about the he said, she said
What's it all about
Check out my melody
Check out my fabulous beat

Just one more fight and I'll be history
Yes I will straight up leave your shit
And you be the one who's left, missing me

Yeah, this time I'ma let it all come out
This time I'ma stand up and shout
I'ma do things my way
It's my way, my way or the highway

This time I'ma let it all come out
This time I'ma stand up and shout
I'ma do things my way
It's my way, my way or the highway

Someday you'll see things my way
'Cause you never know, like you never know
When you're gonna go

Someday you'll see things my way
'Cause you never know, no you never know
When you're gonna go
