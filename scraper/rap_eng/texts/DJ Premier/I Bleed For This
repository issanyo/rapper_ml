[Intro: Big Shug]
Aha, I bleed for what I believe in, you feel me?
Aha, Preem!

[Verse 1]
I bleed for the streets, I bleed for the talk
I bleed for soldiers lying in chalk
I see it from all sides so I take position
To have a clear aim at my opposition
And foil my essence, I count my blessings
I keep the fans bopping until their convalescence
When it comes to real rhymes, they say I'm the best
Cause when i talk to you, I say it with my chest
I could say it with my best, but i say it with my song
And all you little kitty rappers, please run along
I bleed for my music, I bleed for respect
To make sure you never forget the architects
You can keep your checks, pay me in cash
Fuck the government in the "I-R-Ass"
Sometimes crash, but always with class
Make more noise than a shotgun blast

[Hook]
I bleed for what I believe in
I bleed for hip hop, all day
I bleed for my family
I bleed, I bleed, hey-ey

[Verse 2]
I bleed for Guru, y'all know that
But some twisted minds want to alter the facts
I scratch off numbers and I alter the gat
And watch you tap out when you're hitting the mat
How dare you question the legacy of the team
It's still Gangstarr nigga, Guru and Preem
And Big Shug said "Sing it like Al Green"
I bleed for the team, Real know what I mean
Authentic Boston-New York sound
Twenty years plus, we're still down
Pound on the table if you like boom-bap
And pound out the middle if you're blowing the back
And pound on my fists if you getting them stacks
And pound on your chest if Preemo is still crack
I bleed for soul music with a hip hop twist
King James baby, witness this
Bleed

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
What's up with new cats who're signing paperwork
Put yourself in position and bleed, or get hurt
You know blood's in, and blood goes out
If you hussle it, then shut your mouth
I bleed for family, I bleed for my life
I bleed for hip hop, and I always do it right
I bleed for God, and praise him dearly
And every time I pray, I know that he hears me
Some say Jesus Christ, some Allah
Madmen praise to almighty Jah
Michael Sam is not my man
He can do what he wants, cause he can
They say it's your land, and my land
I bleed for the truth before I leave man
Mass confusion, we can't understand
But someday we all get the answers, man
Bleed

[Hook]
