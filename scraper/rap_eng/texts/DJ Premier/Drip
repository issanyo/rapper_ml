[Intro]
Alright, let's one take this shit

[Verse 1: Abstrakt]
I’m the kid that steals candy from toddlers at the carnival
But I’m a carnivore, so I toss the candy at a whore
I gave her twelve seconds to run but she just wanted more
So I gave it to her raw shimmy shimmy fucking ya
Hey yo, take a hit of this, it’s that Cali cannabis
You think that you can handle it? Shit, I got a can of this
You can bring your stress but I don’t plan on having it
I already got some dank chilling in the cabinet
Now look, I don’t only rap about killing shit
I can rap about the herb to broken relationships
But I ain’t gonna do that shit ‘cause you don’t want to sit through it
So I stick to bud, it’s universal and intuitive
The smoke is smooth so it’s probably best that you be kind to it
Inhale, and exhale, like your throat’s a conduit
Take a hit and pretty soon you’re gonna be all into it
Wait a sec you’re gonna be all faded and incompetent
Call Carl Sagan up and get to fucking blazing up
Feeling like an astronaut, stuck, and then we’re gazing up
Rolling up Swishers until fingers form blisters
A blunt to the face gets you twisted like twisters
The bowl is lackin’, get crackin’ wait who’s packin’
Call in the captain, oh shit here’s comes the kraken
Smashing through the ceiling like, what the fuck just happened
Screaming crazy like Sticky Fingaz when he’s rappin’
It’s clear this is a marijuana-influenced style
Buddah went and then enlightened up the white grape Owl
Now the second hand’s spinning and minutes turn into hours
Cottonmouth spitting and munchies that we devour
And people always saying that weed makes you lazy
Well maybe that’s exactly what I need ‘cause I’m crazy
Can’t phase me, I’m faded, way past elevated
But you can stay mad like an ex-girl who’s jaded
