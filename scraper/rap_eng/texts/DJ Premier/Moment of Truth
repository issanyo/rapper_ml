[Napoleon Da Legend verse 1]
My appetite for life is infinite without an end in sight
Tried and failed a million times I had to get it right
Shipwrecked like Robinson Crusoe on a desert island
No longer thousand island dressing on top of my salad
The city’s overcrowded started taking cold showers
Noticed humble folks are those who hold the most power
Sacrifices you make in and out of state
Going outside your comfort zone, feeling out of place
Early morning in the gym and it’s a ghost town
Still I gotta get my body strong in case it goes down
And there’s an urgency it’s hard for me to slow down
Feel like Barry Gordy in the early days of Motown
They didn’t have the Internet I wonder how they did
It was harder then we constantly complain bout the business
How you calculate success? Single sales and dollars
Inside ya bank account how many shows or followers?
Respect amongst ya peers, family and friends?
How you helping others? Ya inner peace or ya zen?
My art is all I own give it 110%
When I’m gone I wanna leave something on earth for my kids
And the rest of the world to understand the way that we live
And inspire all the youth to do better than what we did

[Napoleon Da Legend verse 2]
I love waking at the crack of dawn when the streets is empty
Mother Earth giving us air gotta treat her gently
My mother’s there and she cares for my well-being
Used to stress her but lately I can tell she can see it
Getting this Velvetta doing what I love
Long stretch from I was J.O.B.'ing for a dub
Cause it u let it you can lose ya motivation fast
Caught up chasing ass being lazy straying from the path
And being disappointing in people not keeping promises
But whatever you promised is promised, I don’t bother with
Anything that’s not in my control cause god knows
Many nights i felt the cold just searching in my soul
Where the ghosts and dark entities roam and fog my energy
Demons I collected became part of my identity
From ashes I rise in all my splendor and brashness
Smacking these arachnids in my sleep yo I got this
Cause my worse enemy is me and the penalty’s
Deep carry my weight like a centipedes knees
Let my legacy speak when my body gone eating Szechuan
Word to Chapelle I’m a never put a dress on
Staring at the truth on my death bed floating towards the lights
I’ll never die Cause my life’s in ya head set
Breaking the rules and I’m no longer confused
I guess I seen my moment of truth
