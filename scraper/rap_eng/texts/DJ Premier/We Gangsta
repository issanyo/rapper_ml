[Intro]
And everybody wants to be a killer
And everybody wants to be a gangsta
But you can't be, what you wanna be
Cause we are truly gangsta

[Verse 1: Big Shug]
You niggas style is bum, you niggas suck like thumbs
Matter fact, where the fuck you come from
You ain't gangster at all, you ain't got no balls
You only tough when it's cops to call
We gangsta for real, we talk loose still
Cock clap, how does that feel? (What)
You getting weak at the knees, we taking all of your cheese
You gangster? Nigga please
We do violent acts, you do platinum plaques
And pay niggas to watch your back
Me and these niggas, it's all I got
So we bring the drama and we pop the shots
You only pop on records and CDs
Only thugging on radios and CVs
Look at me, I'm what you wanna be
But you sold your ass for G's, it's a rap
And you can never come back
You're better of working in the circus, black
This here is real rap and I got something for ya
Cock, clap (cock, clap, cock, clap)

Hook:
We gangsta, we gangsta
We gangsta, you better tell them
We gangsta and we came to play
You better tell them, we gangsta
We gangsta, we gangsta
You better tell them, we gangsta
And we came to play

[Verse 2: Singpore Cane]
Walked in gangsta images, playing the games a life scrimmages
Gangsta niggas been under [?] since genesis
Hardcore niggas get shot and turn religious but
My niggas roll deep like slums in the villages
Spinage is a root of evil, my militance is see you
And break you up like evil canival
If today was Friday, then I'd be Deebo
Taking your chain, your bike and your fucking weed too
I got enough attitude so I don't need yours
Get me fired up and I will explode like I was C4
Catch me with Ray Lewis slapping niggas in B-more
Crazy as fuck, what you think I need cheese for
I am not even a celebrity and I got more bitches
Than Ron Jeremy what the fuck is you telling me
You might see me in the [?]
With enough ammo to supply the Gaza Strip
Now that's gangsta

Hook: (x2)
We gangsta, we gangsta
We gangsta, you better tell them
We gangsta and we came to play
You better tell them, we gangsta
We gangsta, we gangsta
You better tell them, we gangsta
And we came to play
