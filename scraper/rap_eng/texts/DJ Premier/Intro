[Hook]
A little 1,2 to clear your soul
My sickle cell got my blood very low
Im getting kind of cold can you spare a coat
Its Fidel Mofuckin Ca$hflow (X2)

[Verse]
Are we safe anywhere
Trump became president
Should I live in fear
That my skin color gonna lead my mom in tears
Is my complexion not light enough to live here
Or
Should I go back to Haiti
Where niggas out here killing and they raping all these babies
Where natural disaster always striking almost daily
My mind is more complex
Sometimes it drives me crazy
But Ya boi like to act blind
Ignorance is bliss
Answers that we cannot find
We rather raise our fists
Than to merge and design
A plan to fix the drought
There's a lack of sunshine
Ayy off this conscious shit
I only started rapping for the fuck of it
To all rapper not comfortable practicing
Ur only as good as ur ever gonna get
So don't come for my clique
Words slice like machetes
U will get ripped
Cut into pieces and fed to the fish
Don't let your mon witness it
You might survive
If u stick ur head in a turbine
And let it split
Ever mofuckin ligament
U not my mans
U a fan
Like a cool breeze
I'm a rapper
Taking chance
Throwing up my 3s
U in the stands
I'm on demand
Like a movie
I been the man
With the plan
Watch the buzzer beat
Whoa
I put in overtime tied score
Up in my business
But You need to mind yours
If u venomous
Words I'll ignore
Like jehova witnesses
Knocking up on my door
Knock knock
I'm not home
Leave me lone
In my zone
Your Call blocked
No dial tone
We not joint to the hip
Like a femur bone
Just A bunch of dumb niggas with smartphones

[Hook]
A little 1,2 to clear your soul
My sickle cell got my blood very low
Im getting kind of cold can you spare a coat
