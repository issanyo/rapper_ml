[Intro]
Lil' Dap: Damn son
Melachi: What the fuck is wrong with you man?
Shit shouldn't be happening out here man
Niggas don't be realizin' the shit, man
But yo, tell 'em what you be seein' out your window
Lil' Dap: Yo I be seeing out my window gunshots everyday
Melachi: Man yo I be seeing sex money and drugs too but yo
Tell 'em how Duke said
Lil' Dap: The world's about to end

[Verse 1: Lil' Dap]
Feared by bandits hated by chicks
Loved by kids and never did a bid
Yes the Group Home is thick
Plus I don't eat beef cause these busy ass niggas and chicks think shit is sweet
Yo I work hard and hard my man praising down to the gods
After that keep it movin' have no time to be foolin'
Around town A&R's you get down with the hype sound
The things I say will make a grown man dream
I speak sayings "Go by yourself, be by yourself"
Let my lyrics vibrate and shake the earth
I travel ghetto to ghetto back streets to streets
Kick a rhyme or crime with this ill mastermind
Mom dukes used to tell me with these tears in her eyes
Now I'm out on my own survival with the time
Like an African tribe little Dap will blow your mind
Check it out like this and then like that

[Verse 2: Melachi The Nut Cracker]
Suprise attack, strike from the back
Black maniac, power impact
Fact, anyway is the way
Death wishes I pray to the KKK
That's what I said, hitler is a dickhead
My black crew is coming at you with the nappy dreads
Much realer, dough is my thriller
I'm gettin' more iller than the Zodiac killer
Yeah, flipping shows like stunt men
I'm just thumping, the beat is pumping
In your ear very clear better be aware
Now you know I'm a motherfucking nightmere
Yeah, superman supa star
Give me super fat dough like Pablo Escobar
"Super duper star"

[Hook]
("So what the fuck y'all movin' on up")
("Yes the Group Home is thick so all y'all punks hear this)" (x3)
("So what the fuck y'all movin' on up")
("Yo check it check it out like this here we go")

[Verse 3: Lil' Dap]
Yo I got niggas flipping they wig
Chicks grabbing they cunts
As they rhyme they get doper and then they greet me with blunts
One times for your mind before I break these streets
Ain't nothing holding me back hip hop tracks
Yo son you know the feelin' shit will get revealed
As the times will get better
Watch me walk that walk and talk that talk
Popping through the ghetto with that group home walk
Cause at the corner of my crib drug war is going on
Ma dukes got to pack before she walks out the door
Watch you back stay cool, you never know who's a fool
I stand back and attract, kid you're beefing for rap
Got to much on my mind some days I think like crime
A little chaos, chaos, set it, set it, set it
Lyrics I connect, ayo nut crackers next

[Verse 4: Melachi The Nut Cracker]
Madness, madness, lies from hell
Living on this earth much pain I've felt
Tried not to melt to the rough hard times
Came this far, did me mines
Bust the rhymes in your face like that
A new supervillian my teammate is dap
Back to back with the a-mob crew
Rolling over you, I do what I gotta do
The nut cracker, watch the earth shatter
Brains will splatter from who, the nut cracker
No lie but before I say bye
You can't take money with cha when you die

[Hook]
("So what the fuck y'all movin' on up")
("Yes the Group Home is thick so all y'all punks hear this)" (x3)
