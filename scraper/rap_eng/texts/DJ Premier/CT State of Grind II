[Verse 1: BvgattiCT]
It's been a long time, since i've spit a long rhyme cosigned with
A dream with closed eyelids; cause i ain't never tried it
Never been the type to sleep, i never denied it
Imma star in alignment with the belt like Orion
Man all these hoes sould they soul for heels with red soles
And gold with clothes that embody their whole persona
But truthfully the newer me really ain't trynna know you
Cause i got big dreams baby, its like a coma
Me and competition broke up, they couldn't grow up
So a nigga had to roll up, sorry i ain't sober
Hit my nigga Josh and told him i needed closure
So i wrote this 16 just to tell them its over
Game time, watch your lane im past the state line
They better put the stakes high, if niggas tryin to take mines
Never make eye contact, this isnt face time
Its about time to rape this, but nah this isnt dateline
On a paper chase but nah, i never chase dimes
Only thing i chase is Patron if it dont taste right
Me and Fame got a prenup if it dont stay right
But fuck Fame, i made that bitch come like i used KY

(Chorus)(x2)
CT State of Grind. (x3)
From '82 to '99

[Verse 2: BvgattiCT]
Its been a long time time, since ive spit a long rhyme
Cosigned with a clothes minded outfit, my showtime shit
Designed to make a mess
Addressing all of the best with a set of 16s
My 8s would put them to rest, no less
My 12s would put a nigga to death, god bless
So my 16s would really make a bitch bleed
I let the bitch breathe, then get back at it
Like an addict hiding crack in her ass, up in the attic gettin'..
High as Messiah, or prolly higher than taxes
And what i lack in dress code, im never slackin'
So I told them i want it all
Momma told me to strap in
Its gone be a long ride to the riches, they trynna back in
Nah.... I dont know cause the lane of fame is a one way
And so my time comin', the fans waitin' on one day
But waitin' on that now is like spottin' her in a crowd
I came too far just to give it up now, you hear my sounds son?
You ain't the only one; Probably among many
Just the other day a fan of my mans, said he ain't ready
So to keep the mood steady i told him: Just keep your head up
But he thought that i was sly, and replied: Your way better..
Ain't that a feelin'
Ain't no need to conceal it
I feel the need to reveal that my music really appeal to the..
Real niggas.. Fake bitches
My team about to make it, i put the lord as my witness

(Chorus)(x2)
CT State of Grind. (x3)
From '82 to '99
