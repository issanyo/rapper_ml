[Verse]
Beginning to think, I might need a wifey
Dating all of these women is getting pricey
The whole situation is getting dicey
But them bumping into each other excites
Common sense tells me to do the right think but
My ignorance tells me I'm doing it
I'm Pritt Stick, glued to the game too innit
To be removed, wanna quit but I'm too legit
Too slick to give up the way I'm living man
Got cash as long as people wanna sniff a gram
Ain't changed, ain't lies, if I'm different man
People say any different, I couldn't give a damn
Let 'em hate, say I switched the flow
Course I've switched the flow, old shit is old
Out with the old, in with the new shit
For my haters, that all wishing they could do this
Think you're big? I don't think you're big enough bitch
I'm struggling to pick a brush to smear your blood with
I don't think I'm a t'ug ya little fuckwits
It's fun when they think I'm a punk, then get a bust lip
No miming, just rhyming, I'm hot Prof
And this is my spot 'til I'm in a pine box
Aquire dosh, I'd be lying if I said my lines off
But it ain't nah, licking my shots
Knee deep in slosh, whilst you're still beating off, silly
Billie's, A Millie's, nearly just taught me to OZ
Have I got crabs or am I just itching my crotch
In my business but you're interns in it, I'm the boss
Afternoon, I'm just passing through
On stage after me? That's a par for you
How do you make something so easy look so hard to do?
Pass my zoot!
Now I'm high up, as high as high gets
Get cycle eight past the class but I ain't sat my test
They say I'm best when I jest, I beg to differ
I say I'm sicker when I'm vexed
That's when I rap better at the end of my tether
I'm silly clever, poppy, cocky, like I ain't ever been beat ever
But whoever, hear you talk shit better walk it
Or else walking is gonna get a little awkward
Type to run a red just to see your Porsche flip
Run your lips and I hope you're being in to tortured
Olders and youngers, best to knows the cold is amongst us
I ain't boasting, just being real
Somebody give me a pill, I got a headache
P's not a dunce, don't menstruate but I am a bleeding cunt
That don't hesitate, when it comes to beef I run
Straight back in it, with a lyric on fire like when I'm in the clinic
I am into digits, yeah I like P
Dairy intolerant but high off cheese
I'm a punchline king, I dare anyone of these chumps to try a ting
Step into my ring and let's swing for it
Life I'll make you sing for it
Ain't nothing but puppets on my strings, ding
I made my way in, with raps so fat
I had to drop my boxers when I weighed in
From saving, I was hot the first CD I dropped was amazing
Hating begins now the albums coming
I came back they wondered how I done it and now what?
Doubt not, I'm as sick as I sound
Prof, come to your house party just to piss in your mouth wash
