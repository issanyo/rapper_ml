[Verse 1: Majestic Gage]
First off I'd like to state that most you niggas are garbage, b
Saying this wholeheartedly so you never got to pardon me
I do this flawlessly, cause it's flowing through my arteries
They not as hard as me, junior varsity with their artistry
What's up with all these rappers, seems their train of thought is narrow
Funny style niggas with strange choice in apparel
These words barely travel cause the situation's fragile
Label executives scraping the bottom of the barrel
Got me in the underground, going hard from the gravel
Whoever's at the surface's on the wrong side of the barrel
Sickest with the precision, crossbow with the arrow
Hit you in the your Ralph Lauren, knock the nigga off the saddle
They not soldiers in fatigues, they're just dojas and fatigued
Mascot niggas talking to the owners of the league
Claim they known for pushing ki's, which is rather hard to believe
Just some sucker MCs that be rolling with the D's
Inherited my talent from my great-grandfather's grandson
Bar for bar, they don't wanna shoot the fair one
Throw their hardest punchlines but could barely land one
Then try playing foul, but I still score, my nigga, and one
Don't care about your Phantom, where you rockin' your shines out
Sonning corny rappers, I'm 'bout to put 'em on timeout
Have 'em standing in a corner, facing a wall
See that's what happens when the Flipper's in a tank with the Jaws
Come on

[Verse 2: A-Bless]
Flow is premiere, star in the game
You niggas wired, like guitars and the strings
Spar with the king, you could never knock me down
If you don't know, then you sleeping, Pacquiao
A-Bless -- when I was young, my mother stayed stressed
Cause I pushed pieces on the block, I ain't play chess
Swagging, whatever belt, pants sagging
Throwing bands, now these bitches on the bandwagon
Will shoot, vest on, steel boots
Bitches say he got a little gut, but he still cute
Post with the grams, no filter, you got me?
You niggas live for that Instagram, nigga not me
Watch me, what you gonna do when the money come?
Then I ball hard with my niggas 'til the money done
Then we get the money up again, make a money run
I got money now, put up money to get money done
Niggas don't know 'bout it, eyes D, no wallet
High like a jet, me and Izzy, he the co-pilot
Mad cause I do more, GT two-door
Big, moving like a U-Haul, nigga you too small
My niggas gonna fuck any bitches we like
Standing on the couch in the club, like, "What it be like?"
It's dark, but I got my ice on, you gon' see light
Do it for my niggas locked up that won't see light
I'm gone

[Verse 3: Tashane]
I'll prolly be up top sitting with six felonies
And violent from the bullshit a bitch telling me
Reading a book called "Nigga" by Dick Gregory
It's giving me insight, listen and get well with me
When night falls, you could get your life lost
Blacks fighting in white wars belong in psyche wards
If they like yours, give it up or get sniped off
Cause they hungry, putting ones together like pause
All these rappers now say they got the molly
And hold weight, bet they roll on you like a dolly
A bow eight , waiting for a come-up in the lobby
With no cake, 'bout to risk it all for a cold plate
I'm starving, start to look at my peers different
Don't use my mouth much, just let my ears listen
Jail got me fucked up, swear I could hear prison
The cell doors locking, still keeping a clear vision
I'm spitting soul culture, see y'all scared, I'm so vulture
Demolish the track with no OSHA
Let's toast to me spitting fire, got halatosis
I'll roast yah-- it's light like mimosa
I told yah I'm flaming, aiming
They set traps but I never fell in, I'm Raymond
I tell facts like Diggin' In The Crates is on the rise again
Watch you fall in the eyes of men
Fort Apache

[Verse 4: A.G.]
Now I'll diss your favorite rappers all at the same time
Line 'em all up, put us on the other side
Let's get it, yeah nigga, Bronx embedded
Feel like I was born on Cedar and Sedgewick
Time's up, cause I'm up
So many G's in my circle, this ain't a cypher, this a line-up
Play with the purple, no rehearsal
Do this for Gifted Unlimited Rhymes Universal
It's Show and A 'til I backseat to Earth
And how you the king, when I was crowned since birth?
And how you a gangsta, you running 'round with a murse?
How I'm under arrest, when I'm just smoking the Earth?
Yeah, you in a verse to message me
Obama the president, I voted for Eric B
Mob style, guerrillas on the compound
Bronx bound and we don't calm down
What!?
