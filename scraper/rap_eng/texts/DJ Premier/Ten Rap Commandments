[Verse 1: Benny Boy]
I've been in this game for years, I'm supposed to be an animal
They told me that I'm supposed to follow the manual
Try to act real, try to act tangible
Feed off every other rapper like a cannibal
Satisfy your fans and you'll, give them what they want
Talk about the trendiest new thing to come
And remind them that they're broke and they can't afford none
Listeners play catch up, that was number 1
Number 2, you always got to roll with a crew
And all of them are gangsters, including you
And brag how tougher you are from the others
If a crew had a ten foot pole they couldn't touch ya
Number 3, you got to be raised from the streets
And your whole career, needs to thrive off of beef
If you ain't got no one to beef with
Skim radio waves til' you see sick
Number 4, I know you've heard this before
Think that you're the best rapper alive
Number 5, you can't write or you can't spit?
Hire ghostwriters to write all your hits
Number 6, tell your girl to go and ball her fists
Cause the groupies at shows can make you call it quits
Number 7, be foul and disrespect them
Like flagrants, send them for the line like Kevin
And if that upset them, follow number three
Cause it ain't too late to generate some hate
Number 8, always keep your money on your mind
Even if you unravel your family ties
Number 9, any exposure is worth it
So try and get in front of paparazzi on purpose
Flinch at photographers, make em' all nervous
Make sure the girl you're accompanied with is a perfect
10, this is more important than the others bruh
Music industry is the number 1 hustler
Rappers are the product, fans are the customers
Make money off of you until they had enough of ya
Kick you to the curb before you can blink your eyelids
Have you double and triple checking all of the fine print
I was contemplating if I would label it nonsense
Cause I started rapping from the table of contents
Now I'm at the index, flipping through the glossary
Then I realized that it's way too hard for me
Tore up the booklet, I just couldn't stand it
Cause I don't have to follow the 10 rap commandments (what)
