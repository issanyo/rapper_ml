My j's high grade GO BACK TO YA NANS
With mind games on a psywave NO ALAKAZAM /
My boy's a star FOREVER TO THIS HUMAN EARTH
So understand my son remains the CENTRE OF MY UNIVERSE/

Fuck up this beat with the BARS THAT I'M BLAZING
I hit it first no kanye but i'm AFTER THE RAY TING /
Head strong like pele and YOU'RE JUST WANK
I strike but they turn a blind eye GORDON BANKS /

Used to hate stupid as a YOU TUBE TROLL
But it flipped when kids played the prick to a VOODOO DOLL/
USE LOO ROLL to wipe away the SLOW RAP SHIT
KNOW MANS SICK i do this for the love NO SAM SMITH/

Ive come a long way like a NERDS COLLECTION
Making school boy errors but i 'LEARNED MY LESSON'
..so im thankful for the likes and the STORY WITH IT
Coz i only tend to get a little love like a HORNY MIDGET //

Maybe i'm crazy.. that's WORD TO CEE LO
Killing art with every paragraph that's MURDER SHE WROTE /
Born a talented winner with NOTHING TO LOSE
So you can play the judge i've got NOTHING TO PROVE /

ALL THAT COOL CHAT but you ain't got BALL BAGS
Them man ain't even selling heroin but yeah they TALK SMACK /
FALL BACK with fiction when in FACT THEIR NOT A GANGSTER
Don't believe me? check the proof n HAVE A PROPER GANDER

Yeah you got a little bar but not MUCH ELSE
Slow dickheads get reps of light work.. DUMB BELLS /
Fishing for a hook shows your INSECURE
The end of your lines are bait and fake, FISHING LURE /

I know my path but for you there's no ESCAPIN
Coz right now you're in the place with A MAZE IN/
LIGHT THOSE SPLIFFS coz my MINDS SO SICK
No crazy siblings but i'm dealing with a PSYCHO SIS //

Poor man's door trap JOTT A GRITTY VERSE
We could talk money all day but WHAT'S IT REALLY WORTH? /
Never in a debt nor EXPECTING SILENCE
Money talks yeah but to earn RESPECT IS PRICELESS /

Too strong for the MENTAL BLOCKS THAT WOULD WARP THE DOME
Like survivING a TEMPLE SHOT FROM THE CORNER STONE /
It dont matter if you don't FEEL MY IMAGE
...you'd think i had immortal cheerleaders coz you couldn't KILL THE SPIRIT


I was nath the needy truant
..who could never quite get on with those who came to teach the students
Engaged in greedy prudence making seedy movements
Disliked life so much that i would hate on breeding humans
Haters wanna hate and create discrete illusions
And the foolish follow suit because they believe delusions
I stay away, so i hate to be a nuisance
But i need to sort it coz i want my life to change and see improvements
N keep dreamin, but whatever fuckin helps me sleep
Chin gentsai spit game, my tongue will melt emcees
No win for them nah them cunt can smell defeat
..more chance of seeing a country bumpkin brushing healthy teeth
I'm not gonna be another one who fell beneath
A bloody world of grief or stuck in hell for keeps
Struggling, but i don't need no fucker helping me
Becoz i keep myself on track with nothing but my self belief
