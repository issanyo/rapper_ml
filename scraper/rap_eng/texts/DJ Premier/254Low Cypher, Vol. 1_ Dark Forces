[Intro: Octopizzo]
Yeah, y-yeah
Woo! It's Namba Nane, baby!
You know what it is
Okay, ye-yeah, ye-yeah, ye-yeah
(DJ Crème!)
Yeah, let's go!

[Verse 1: Octopizzo]
Okay, cheki
On your marks, get ready
Akili ni nywele, bado vile kuna venye kila msee ananyoa madredi
Ulimi imembao, reason natema ka niko steady
Na nikikuja na virus, mi huwamada ka ukedi
Nikivaa macho nne, mi hu[?] ka lady
Nikivutanga makuru mi huwa slim ka Shady
Wako zile za, "Octopizzo, uko high"
Yeah, niko high juu bado sijadedi
Yeah, niko high juu nilipitia kwa pedi
Na hapa Nairobi, natafuta [rudia?], design ya Eveready
So Nairobi, ah-hah
Bana, tumia bongo ka wasee wangu wa Da
Na ka kawaida, man
Niko juu, juu wako down mpaka morrow, man
Niko Yu juu Safaricom ina-borrow, man
Ukija na silver, nakuja na ugoro, man
Ukija na mpyenga, na-come na kikoro, man
Leo ni leo, hakuna di story ya morrow, man
Ni P-I-double Z, ay-ay
So huwezi kuwa juu, ay, hata utumie juju
[?] kibandani yako ka Buju
Then mi ndio na-come na Newton ka Kulundu
Ni wanachama, kazi yao tu ni kuniangalia—
Namba Nane, you know how I do this
You know how I do this, I don't do this like Doobiez
I kill niggas! You know what it is
Blah!
Mmemaliza ama bado?

[Verse 2: Timmy]
Yeah, uh, Timmy Tim, ch'yeah
See when you make it and you finally famous
The first thing that'll change is the people you hang with
Friends turn into strangers and you didn't claim this
Start to explain, it's just part of the game
In which you have to make sacrifices
If you wanna rap the nicest, or buy yourself expensive ice
And the flashing lights follow you around
Losing touch of reality, so hold on to the ground, damn
See I'm just tryna come off as different
Acknowledgin' the fact that only some of us listen
To what we usually say without havin' to stress it
'Cause every single verse I put down has a message
So they askin' me questions, I never learned to answer
Not because I'm stupid, I just never had the chance to
Intellectual, my mind is like a mansion
I don't use it for really though, to save you the embarrassment

[Verse 3: Yung Kass]
Shappaman, cypher, Yung Kass, let's go
Uh, I keep it cool like Cool J, hooray
Kick and push like Lupe
Skateboard P, I'm for real all day
And we like to party like Beyoncé
That's my city, Nairobi's got love if you feel me
Hate it or love it, the underdogs still bit him
Been tryin' for a long time, diallin' the wrong line
But on a mission and now they callin' me a spoiled child
Okay, I get it, they tryna make me panic
But fuck it, I'm so determined that I should run the planet
I'm tired of thinkin' average, now I'm thinkin' like a maverick
The police station's got M-Pesa, can you imagine?
Uh, but who am I to speak?
I'm CSI, kinda deep
A car full of stars, that's astrology, obviously
And niggas tryna ball like the Premier League
Who do I represent? Boy, you know it's Kenya Team

[Outro]
