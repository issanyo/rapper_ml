In this link, you can hear .Paak’s verse for this song

Spits something like this [correct if wrong]:

“Front page on the front line
More crime
Shots from the automatic fire
One died
Doc. say it please not mine not mine
Doc said "nothing we could do … no time”

All he ever wanted was a break of some kind
Looking at his reflection gripping that 4-5
Sipping on cough medicine
God bless him
Did a coke line off the dresser then started flexing

Dipping through the avenues of treachery
Misdemeanor misdemeanor felony
Said it “he was ready if he never leave”
And if they wanted beef then it was perfect cause the pedigree
Clutching to a rosary, rolling with the opposition
Running from authorities, feelings and a stolen pistol

Settle down boy they gone get you
YOU RUN AROUND LIKE YOUR TOO OFFICIAL."

[PRE-HOOK COMES IN]
