[Intro: Joey Bada$$]
Third time's a charm
Funk Flex drop the bombs
We about to hit them with the harm, so stay calm
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, is this New York?
Is this NYC?
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, okay

[Verse 1: Joey Bada$$]
Skinny nigga with a fat wallet
First class seats right behind the pilot
O.N.I.F.C, fucking living lavish
I've been getting stylish
I'm just being modest
Fucking up the commas
Fuck reading comments
You would know whats real if you was really conscious
Substantial content in anything I'm dropping
And the flows i'm kicking, k-k-karate chop 'em
Back to the topic
Going so hard with no plans of stopping
Yeah, looking so strong, got a whole lot of options
Hair growing so long, covering up my optics
And this is coming from the top, though I came from the bottom
With enough fire in my heart to move a whole mountain
And I sip the youth from the fucking fountain
Won't stop 'till my name what they shoutin'
Overseas and the money I'm countin'
So just chill, I breeze
Just trynna fight the good fight
The Devil is alive, walk with him on good nights
Channeling my higher self at this time
I'm leveling with the top spot cause it's mine
Ever been high before it must be
Just me, nobody but the world above me
And I could give a fuck how the world could judge me
Cause if I die today I bet they all would love me
God forbid
Knock on wood
Twist fingers in the air, nigga rep your hood
Tell my nigga's still bang, you up to no good
Cause ain't shit changed, we misunderstood
Taking shots to the brain, leave you dead where you stood
Probably hidden the remains, dead bodies in the woods
And that's just how the world revolve
Is it love or evil of the evil of love, tell me lord

[Verse 2: Joey Bada$$]
I said first class seaters
Chilling with my feet up
These bitches just keep ID's up
These niggas just wanna be us
You see us, it's obvious
We moving like mafias
Heard they wanted a verse with a hearse, where my fee is
Told mama that I'll feed us
I ode as your fetus
Birth of the true leader, they can never defeat us
No time for non-believers, they ain't worth our ether
Remember my school teachers never had faith neither
Now i'm at the Ivy Leagues as a big time speaker
I just got my new advance, I'm 'bout to park my jeep up
So keep up if you can
I'm the man, understand
Got the motherfucking world in the palm of my hand
Drop a bomb on a man, but never harming my man
And if it's tucked in my pants, it's all according to plan
Never missed me with the patience, my timing will win
They in a sticky situation now, call in the jam

[Interlude: Joey Bada$$]
Hold on, hold up, hold up, hold up
I think i got another one

[Verse 3: Joey Bada$$]
I come off the top, yes it's the golden child
The Brooklyn son, I'm moving, this is so wild
And I got the style, yes, this is freestyle
Funk Flex you might as well drop that bomb now, cause I'm
Going in, it's no signs of stopping
Anytime we going in, trust me we 'gon win
We never taking a loss
And thats of course
Because we just gotta floss and we keep it lit, I said

[Interlude: Joey Bada$$]
Hold up, hold up, let me catch the beat right
Hold up, hold up, let me catch the beat right
Yeah, yeah, said let me catch the beat right
Okay, yeah, okay

[Verse 4: Joey Bada$$]
Now we 'gon see who get the last laugh
Funny, cause these niggas always tripping off the gas
Think this shit a joke 'till somebody gets choked
Smoked, for the very words that they spoke
Listen here though
It's getting near close
'Bout to blow your brains through your fucking earlobes
With this one
The kid been gone for a while, they missed him
Patient with the shot when I blast off, won't miss him
My last victim went missing
Fuck sneak dissing
I hit 'em off from a distance
Another check off of my hitlist, fuck a witness
Then all of you'd eventually get this
You dismissed
Done now, finito
Talking like you lethal but we simply don't belive you
Nobody wants to be you
If your life was a movie, wouldn't even watch the preview
I guarantee it won't be no sequel
When we see you, we'll probably leave you see through
You talk guns cause you need those
Everything is done to the Max no Keeble
Circle tighter than Speedo, I'm the Don like Cheadle
I can spit the old bars off the top and still defeat you
I make these rap airways stone hard to breathe through
Took a student in the game just to come and teach you niggas
