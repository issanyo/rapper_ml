Verse:

Looking at all my brothers faces
All I see is hatred
An most women are faithless
All I do is stick it to em
Like take it
My phrases are the greatest
Impressive to the haters
All black on the track
Like a darth vader
Leave u in pieces like a grater
Put it all together while u still
Puzzled
Got ur chick wet like I'm stepping
In a puddle
That suede on my shoes
Got ghosts on ur asses like pick a boo
Nice guy but my attitude is kinda
Rude
My pants say guess an u
Askin' who
Unorthodox like the blunt
In my socks she know
I'm easy but my dick kinda
Hard
I won't stop no no
I won't stop I'm too fucken
Great
Fuck it easy never late
StadiQ nigga
That's all I'm gonna say
Caus u know the truth thy told
Me
It don't suit u like a
Tie
Cause nigga u a lie
X-Men niggers still fly
On that first class shit
This shit an oxymoron
An this beat go so on
I'm gone
I'm gone
Its that eazi nigga motherfucker I'm gone

Dance to it like
Uha
Uha

Chorus:

Do this for my niggers
Who just see me on the street
Do this for my niggers
When I'm riddin round here yea
Ye ye ye yea
Unorthodox is the freestyle by the docks
Unorthodox is the freestyle I just hit bitch

Woah

Reckless behaviour on my worst behaviour too

Whow ...
Rick Flare on you bitches like
Whow
Rick flare on you bitches like
Whow
Whow...
(Sniff)
Whow
(Giggle)

Let the beat play
