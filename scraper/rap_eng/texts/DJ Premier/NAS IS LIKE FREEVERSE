Rush is like infinity
Spitting rhymes that are sickening
Got other rappers bickering
Bout how they can't compare to me
It seems completely fair to me
You need to get your bars up
I'm hotter than the summer
And I'm colder than a starbucks
Drink
So prepare to take an L, like Meek
I will be the most treacherous when at my peak
Or in my prime
I spit a different flow with these rhymes
They tell me I'm the future, I'm ahead of my time you get it
Undeniable
I'm viable
Outshining those
Who claim they're spitting fire those
Who claim they're on the highest road
Who claim that they are killing it
Who claim that they are dishing out
It's time for Rush to show them what I'm bout
You see I -- kill the flows
Chop - rock - deal the flows
I'm like a millionaire without a home
Unheard of
Unspoken
They submitting like a token
And you know that they are choking
On these hot bars
Hot sauce, you know I'm right
I'm like -- Lil Wayne's jeans, cause you know I'm tight
And you know I got a nice style
Know you play it in your system every night now
