- Aiiyo son, it seems like, everyday
More and more people begin to get more foul
Uhn, now dig..
Association breed assimilation
Let me tell you what happened
I'm driving the other night, these two faggots pull me over
Talkin bout I got a broken taillight
They got a broken headlight
They shake me down, they tellin me
That they gon' come and see me tomorrow and have somethin for them
- Word, so what up?
So now I got somethin for them

[Verse One: Guru & Napoleon Da Legend]
Who's the real criminals, take a look behind the scenes
Cause half of goons incarcerated playing in the minor leagues
Guess it pays in many ways to have a few schemes
Gotta do me, before they they put us in a snooze
Make you lose speed
The systems set up in a way to keep us in a trap
Phone tap, crime and justice start to overlap
Remember Ferguson? They taking joy in hurting us
It's like a curse for us, police be the first to bust
Think about it...
Police roam where we struggle most and
For them the evidence'll vanish in a puff of smoke
I've been observant
Had to dig below the surface
I guess you get what you deserve in this
From project hallways to courthouse hallways
Scraping for these bucks no such thing as an off day
Speed on, before you get beat on
All I need is more power, then I'mma put the squeeze on

[Hook]
I want more power, I'm gainin more troops
I'm gaining more respect cause I want more juice
The most influential men, got influential friends
And I'mma put the squeeze on all of 'em

I watched y'all get fat, now I want my share
What you ain't got it all? Then I want what's there
The most influential men, got influential friends
And I'mma put the squeeze on all of 'em

The squeeze..

[Napoleon Da Legend verse]
Hey yo that badge got you gassed?
Gotta hit ya quota so you looking for a black man to bag?
Incarcerating us in mass cause there’s cash in imprisonment
Especially the tenement class
U know the quote, unquote poor who can’t afford lawyers when go to court so they get the book thrown at em
Treating us like our lives don’t matter it’s a known pattern
Do you have a weapon on u? No madam
No ma'am, no officer, no ya honor
I just wanna live longer than the stats show in the left column
I just left Harlem stopped on my way home
Plain coats I guess it’s same ol’, same ol’
New Jim Crow the pipeline from streets to prison
We gotta put a squeeze on the beast defeat the system
Fuck ya biases, this for the blocks and high rises
Watch ya back yo don’t be caught lacking or blind sided
