[Verse 1: Ab-Liva]
Me and Mika
I guess the world-a [?] my girl, I mean
She my heart, my companion, a rider
She thorough like no other chick I know
She like my nigga, when we kicking it
But oh so tender, she surrenders when I'm hitting it
She don't condone the work I do;
Hustling, was hurt a few
Years ago, some nigga named Scope
Was a hard-hitter
I left a little work at her crib
A little paper I owe
I scoop it later, I ain't
Really tripping doe

[Verse 2: Rosco P. Coldchain}
I'm fresh home from a 1 of 3
I did in the [?] correctional facility
Got caught with a small 2.3 grams I cooked up
How they get hooked up?
Mika and this bag, probably had it when I got booked up
She still live at her mother's
And since her brother got kicked out
With me down, he supposed to be the man of the house now?
I think I'll give him a visit
I still know where they living
Knock at the door
"Hi Mom"
"Where you been?"
"In prison !"
Talk my way in, walk to the room. What's this?
[?] a Smith and West forty, a fully loaded clip
Any nigga can get it. I got something for 'em
An appointment with the surgeon
Back of an alley or a backstreet, I

[Chorus: Ab-Liva]
Im'ma kill this nigga
Oo
I can't wait
Im'ma kill this nigga
If there's beef, then there's war in the streets
If it's on, then it's war with your peeps
Until every shot cease
Ain't no calling police

[Verse 3: Ab-Liva]
This nigga violating
Robbed my girl's crib, got my work
Got my burner, got the cash I was slipping
He got my ass, I was flipping
I got the mask, I was dipping
I got the blast, I was tripping
I wouldn't listen to reason, and then it flashed
A vision was positioned. I'm sitting in clear glass
With a ten, all I hear is him taking his last gasp
But my pride-a-make me ride, I'm sinning, a clear mask
That my forty five long, that a [?] you like tear gas

[Verse 4: Rosco P. Coldchain]
I'm back with two strips
A new mac, an even newer clique
And I think that nigga Liva, he know what time it is
I'm back on the map, thanks to you
And Mika, he can keep her, already had your boo
But I got something even more viable
I got his pride in my hands, his money in my stash, and I ain't worried about a thing
I ain't living in the past, my future plans?
Keep it trucking. If we meet again, Imma trunk I'm, double pump him
This ain't Pharell, and I ain't fronting
Only time will tell, I ain't bluffing
I will snuff 'em
If I get a chance to, slump 'em
If I get a chance to, I just purchased a forty one caliber and I want to see what these slugs do

[Chorus: Ab-Liva]
Im'ma kill this nigga
Oo
I can't wait
Im'ma kill this nigga
If there's beef, then there's war in the streets
If it's on, then it's war with your peeps
Until every shot cease
Ain't no calling police

[Verse 5: Ab-Liva]
I went from South West to North
That 18th to Oxford
His Grandma's spot, where he sounding [?] not hard
That little ass strip
Where they say he play the block hard
That little ass vest on his chest
I hope it block hard

[Rosco P. Coldchain]
So you searching for me?
Who the fuck he think he is?
He looking from me
This flea is barking up the wrong tree
Nigga, I did what I did
It is what it is
He went to my block, even came to my grandma's crib

[Ab-Liva]
I'm on the low
Rented out, tinted out
Burner on my lap, with the window cracked, scoping for this nigga

[Rosco P. Coldchain]
It's whatever, Imma shoot your ass to the promised land
And when you meet the lord tell 'em Scope sent you there

[Ab-Liva]
Or i'll send his ass first, but if worst comes to worst

[Rosco P. Coldchain]
Burners gonna burst and someone's gonna end up in the hearse

[Ab-Liva]
The worst mistake, a nigga make

[Rosco P. Coldchain]
Is to doubt you

[Ab-Liva]
I'll see you in hell

[Rosco P. Coldchain]
And it won't be the same without you


[Outro]
Hey, that nigga over there...
Hey Liva
Bitch ass nigga
Somebody got it nigga
Get this motherfucker (gunshots)
YEE HOMIE YEE (gunshots)
OO OOOOOO (gunshots)
OOO YOU MOTHERFUCK (gunshots and bombs drop)
