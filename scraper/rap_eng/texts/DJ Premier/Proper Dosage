[Verse One: Hannibal Stax]
What you put in is what you get out
All I know rappers can't fuck with how I spill out mine
These big kids built off an ill design
Skilled at bagging dimes and such
Relations to crime
Heart and soul, gangsta melodies, is speaking our mind
Plus who brought the heat, seek and you'll find
'89, gravy line, pay me mine or I'mma spray the nine
Don't get caught fucking round hating on mine
Cause I'll walk back, talk back then put it on you
Spark that, throw them things at you and your crew
Shhh
Keep it on the low like who would've knew?
Who'd ever guess Fabbiden rock with the best of the best
Leak a key or two of dopeness, sad request
Hit you with the proper dosage, ease your stress
Give it to you, gun plenty, no less
That pure unadulterated raw black man on deck shit

[Hook: Hannibal Stax] (Boy Big)
(Y'all niggas ain't got this)
A lava flow that's brolic, more than MC'ing
(Cause this is that Fabidden shit)
It's like grizzly gorilla P.I.M.P.ing
(Ain't nothing out got this)
"East New York nigga, y'all know what it is" - Group Home 'Tear Shit Down'
(Cause this is that Fabidden shit)
"Test this"
"Raw street intelligence" - Guru 'Certified'

[Verse Two: Hannibal Stax]
My nigga Big Perm hit me off with consignment
All I could think of was refinement
Fabid' lock and load for the assignment
Get your paper, keep dodging confinement
Feel good don't it, put it in the hood, why won't it
Kinda make you wanna get up and seize the moment
Make honeys so hot they wanna seize and bone it
Make true fans and new fans pleased to own it
The leaking is potent as I put the squeeze on opponents
BK till my dying days, home grown
NY, USA, let it be known
We rep for all our generations with a style of our own
H. Stax, Mike Rone, Fabid, smell it?
Eat well, stay healthy, get big, get wealthy
On the strength we knew we got that shit
And ain't nothing y'all can tell us
We is who we is
That's why

[Hook]

[Verse Three: Hannibal Stax]
All it take is loyalty, devotion and passion
Balance that with royalty, promotion and talent
Avoid the bullshit that make it more than a challenge and there you have it
An uncontrollable knack for making shit happen
Mix that with the Gang and get the party to cracking
Packed in like a Black Joe function, get it jumping
Anybody stunt we dumping and dumping
Give it to 'em how they want, hold back nothing
We do it for hustlers in the street that pump to the beat
For our deceased, Hell or Heaven, rest in peace
For our brethrens, waiting on their date of release
For 9 to 5ers making ends meet week after week after

[Hook]
