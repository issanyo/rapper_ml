[Chorus]
Round and round I go
Where I stop, you will never know
Round and round I go
Where I stop, you will never know

[Verse 1]
I just don't understand
What is your master plan?
What would you have me do?
Confusion in my mind
Been hurt a thousand times
Now I know you're not true
(That's why I can't be with you)

[Pre-Chorus]
You don't know what it meant to me
Just to make you happy
All this time I've waited
Now our love has faded
Please tell me why it's gone
So my life can go on

[Chorus]
Round and round I go
Where I stop, you will never know
(You would never know that I'm going 'round)
Round and round I go
Where I stop, you will never know

[Verse 2]
I told you once before
I'm walking out the door
I'm leaving you behind
Thinking 'bout you all the time
Makes me so sad and blue
Now what are we gonna do
(That's why I can't be with you)

[Pre-Chorus]
You don't know what you did to me
When you told me you loved me
Now you're actin' shady
Now I'm going crazy
Please stop holding back from me
'Cause I got to keep from going 'round

[Chorus]
Round and round I go
Where I stop, you will never know
(Where I stop, you will never know I'm going 'round)
Round and round I go
(Gotta keep from going 'round)
Where I stop, you will never know

[Bridge]
Oh, ohhhh
Oh, ohhhh
Oh, ohhhh
Oh, ohhhh

[Chorus]
Round and round I go
Where I stop, you will never know
(360 degrees I'm going around and around)
Round and round I go
Where I stop, you will never know

[Bridge 2]
You promised me you'd never leave
You said you'd stay with me always
Always
Oh, oh, you'd never leave, oh, oh

[Chorus]
Round and round I go
Where I stop, you will never know
Round and round I go
Where I stop, you will never know
Round and round I go
Where I stop, you will never know
