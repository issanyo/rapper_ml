[Verse 1: Royce Da 5'9"]
Nothin' says friend more than starvin' with your neighbor
Nothin' says family like arguin' and make up
Nothin' says wake up like that cold air
Comin' through that plastic on your window in November
That breeze gave me chills like my introspective pen does
No intellect formed against us shall prosper
Noodles mixed with ketchup, stale pasta
I tossed it in the garbage in the can that's outside
Don't you tell papa; precious or fresh dressin'
Got me stealin' out the register for booster sales
If they don't pass me in school then the institution fails
If you hoopin' good you cool, but I represent the tales
So motherfuck your trust, double-dutch, Hula-hoop betrayals
Dinnertime we got the message well before our food
Puttin' jelly on a sandwich from a deli cart, lose
In the alley cops finna search and we gettin chased through there
We was not in the winner's circle, we just played too square
I done got brain from Spain, Spokane to Maine
And all I'm tryna do is bang cocaine Lorraine
I applied my brand new mantra when I found the art
Tell my consciousness buy a new watch for my counterparts
We make paper, you party, we play Vegas
Nothing besides reign surrounded me when we make wagers
I'm fuckin' the girl of my dreams and we their favorite
That BMWi green like DeRay Davis
I be givin' orders out to niggas' mommas like their grandpa
Trappin' is for rappers, I be grindin' like the dancehall
I don't know astrology, I just know I'm a Cancer, male
Eatin' south of France, he who doubts the man, can't prevail
Back when Guru used to manifest the rhyme
I was known for nothin' less than just a candidate for crime
In and out of Ibiza, spendin' power of Visa
Standin' the test of time like the Leaning Tower of Pisa
In my D-zone so the bitches gon' sweat it
Got the same piece of chrome Sweets loaned Bishop on credit
Got the Glock Craig used to help out Smokey and Day Day with
The .38 Mad Dog used to pop JJ with

[Chorus]
You don't wanna end up on my bad side
Why don't you let me project some of this good on you?
If I ever pick up on a bad vibe
It's all that it's gonna take then I'm good on you
Go on do your thing, go on do your thing
Go on do your thing, go on do your thing
I'ma let you finish tellin' that lie
Go on do your thing, girl do your thing

[Scratches: DJ Premier]
Do my thang
Do my thang
Do ya thang
Do my thang

[Verse 2: Royce Da 5'9"]
Walk up in a strip club lookin' for me a mind to rape
It's Friday so I may stimulate the economy
I don't recollect if I ever offered advice
Make sure you walk it like you talk it or pay the ultimate price
All you petty bloggers and trolls, forever callin' me broke
If my money funny, then y'all must be Eddie, Martin in Life
Fuck the social network, if we talkin' you bring your boss then
Tell them I got two Deserts—I call them the Winklevoss twins
Dodgin' the fake, dark man, dubbin' a cape
All of us are marked men, this hits on y'all
I'm Zartan, scar on the face
Real recognize real, who cares what you foreigners say
My predators from the nation of Islam, corner and pray
Fuck what comparisons say
Ain't got no roof, you just wear a toupée
The coop ain't got no shoes like Eric Benét
Baby, I'm poppin', I got like eight or nine watches
Kick my feet up, check the time on my ankle like I'm Affion Crockett

[Chorus]
You don't wanna end up on my bad side
Why don't you let me project some of this good on you?
If I ever pick up on a bad vibe
It's all that it's gonna take then I'm good on you
Go on do your thing, go on do your thing
Go on do your thing, go on do your thing
I'ma let you finish tellin' that lie
Go on do your thing, girl do your thing
You don't wanna end up on my bad side
Why don't you let me project some of this good on you?
If I ever pick up on a bad vibe
It's all that it's gonna take then I'm good on you
Go on do your thing, go on do your thing
Go on do your thing, go on do your thing
I'ma let you finish tellin' that lie
Go on do your thing, girl do your thing
