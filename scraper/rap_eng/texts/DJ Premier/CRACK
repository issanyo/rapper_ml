I'm what's known as an unknown you niggas is clones
Getting lifted with my realest niggas twisting up bones
I don't profit I'm a prophet and a risk to the throne
You in the closet if you gossip nigga stick to your own
Yea, this as high as it gets
I ain't playing nigga satan trying to tighten the grip
He trying to knock me down and pull me in the fiery pit
But I don't give a fuck I use that shit to light up the piff
I had a dream that I woke up on a battle field
All I did was roll up cause they soldiers wasn't half as real
A master of this rapper shit, a slasher if a half to kill
Passion is ignited after lighting shit and half a pill
Is it cool if I rap about my life?, If I talk about the fucking time a niggas had to fight
Cause them faggot niggas hating on a youngin cause I'm light
Had to prove I wasn't no bitch cause niggas hitting on sight
So you better stick to the rules
Cause its fuck the police, you didn't listen in school
The school of hard knocks where real niggas is cool
Cause I'm a motherfucking graduate you niggas is fools
