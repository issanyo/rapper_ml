[Billy Danze]
Hey yo back by popular demand it's your man Danze
(and Fizzy Womack) from the trenches of the dungeons
Who want some? Remember I'm sick with it
(BROWNSVILLE) B-K nigga, don't forget it
I'm still beat boppin when you see me poppin through
And the money mission seem to be impossible
I put it down, all way across the board
The original O.G. (B.D.) not a fraud
Clap, don't applaud
It's the legendary M.O.P. (yes yes y'all!)
I'm from where a lot of soldiers are found
And the hearse seem to be the illest whip in the town
When the gangsters decide to put it down I'll be around
With my hat broke down, grippin a pound, now
Please send them cats; I'll get up in 'em
With venom bend 'em and send 'em the fuck back!

This money gots to be made (heyyyyy)

Make yourself be heard - OHHHHHHHHH

Here to hold down the streets and the thugs know that
So tell me who in this (who in this)
You in this (you in this)

BACK, one mo' gen (THAT'S RIGHT)
And the, streets is back y'all, come on in
We bring the heat on purpose
Clear, shit in the middle of your show
Like a horse at the circus
Damn what you worth bitch, you get your head gauze wrapped
Real tight, tell me is it worth it?
I'm prepared for the traps that this game brought to me
It's the First Family, tell yo' bitch talk to me, c'mon!
