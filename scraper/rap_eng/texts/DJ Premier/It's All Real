Cruising down Whyte, middle of the night, tryna stay concealed
Making tracks just tryna get a deal on the real
With the boys always in and out the hood
They knew id always make it when nobody said i could
Tellin me take a chance when nobody else said i should
Doing what i do to show people that i would.. uh
Im spitting knowledge for my niggas...
I won't stop til im making four comma figures
Spit a song with Jo-Vaughn and celebrate with my sisters
...this one is for all the listeners
We on the top like we thought we would
Straight outta callingwood
Aiming for the stars, forgot thats Hollywood
Now we aim for the charts, tryna keep em inline
Im tryna get signed, they tell me itll happen in time
Who woulda ever thought at 17 id be in my prime
Impossible to find, designed, im just one of a kind
Im done with all this whack shit
This ignorant rap shit
Whatever happened to passion
The lyric attractions
Im done with all of the fashion, harassin
You ain't gotta ask em bout appearances
Gotta keep this clean because my mama gon be hearin this
Cheering this , even deceased are gonna be fearing this
You think your gonna make it huh?
This song is for boys,  nobody else will listen
Stuck with me through it all when nobody could see the vision
Back to block i never had a pot to piss in
Now i keep em by my side because we on the way to the riches
The difference between winning and losing is picking and choosing
Your enemies, your friends, and whoever your crew is
Wanna kick it gotta tell you just do it
Or sell your soul to the music
We're All in, three lines you can use it
Or abuse it, my flow is to sick
Tipsy off a two-six
Keep your chick polished like its new kick
Never been to collage but got knowledge like i knew things
Plotting for a vengeance this new shit is like a blueprint

Living life like i did this before
Living life with all of my bros
Ya we living life like we did this before
We living life, and we getting them hoes

Back to the topic, back to the dream
Mama told me go to school and get a degree
Because rapping ain't a job when you do it for free
But money ain't the issue cause i only do it for me
So now i do it for K and now i do it for J
Called by first letters we ain't got a first name
Now i do it for A and i gotta to it for D
Straight from grade 8 dont ever mess with my team
They say fake it til you make it but i wanna play fair
Anything goes, just tryna make it onto the air
Told me the message doesn't matter but i want em to care
"you wanna be fair?" guess you dont really wanna be there
Ya i got the hiipower but im still in senior high
Dropped a mixtape cause i wanted to be that guy
Now everyone on my side say its gonna be fun
Just me and the boys, the story just begun

Living life like i did this before
Living life with all of my bros
Ya we living life like we did this before
We living life, and we getting them hoes
