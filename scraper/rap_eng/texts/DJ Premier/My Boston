"Reppin' Boston" - Big Shug

[Verse One] [Big Shug]
It's not the NBA, we don't jump in the air and bump
It's around the way, where cats jump outta the car and dump
Boston
Where some cats, guns are props
Some pop, some end up in the morgue shop
From Blue Hill Ave, to Talbot Ave, to Derby Park
I pushed the whips, hustle my money, and got my start
Norfolk Park is where I rocked and bared my soul
Boston, outta control, death toll
We got cops on foot, and bike patrol
It's been the same way since I was eight years old
Racism
We beat that back
I seen the whole world, but I still keep comin' back
I love my town, not for Paul Revere
But for Big Shug's legend and Murderpan Square
Touch the stage, as a GangStarr survivor
I rep for Boston, and it gets no liver
Than...

[Hook] [Big Shug]
Boston, aye
My Boston, ho
My town
My Boston, hey
My Boston, ho
"Reppin' Boston"
My town
My Boston, hey
My Boston, ho
My Boston, hey
"Reppin' Boston"

[Verse Two] [Singapore Kane]
Yo, think of Boston I think of racists, Charles Stuart cases
Crooked jakes shine flashlights in our faces
Home of the Red Sox, Celtics, and the Patriots
And crash dummy kids with guns ready to spray shit
Every city's the same shit, don't matter the size
Anywhere the population is poor, then you got crimes
Some dudes be doin' crimes, some dudes be doin' rhymes
Salute, my dawgs in the System doin' their time
What you think? Cause we got Harvard
Boston niggas don't be robbin', mobbin' when we starvin'?
Smoke blunts like Redeye back in the Garden
We'll see who's hard, when you're confronted by my squadron
Talk on and on 'bout your million gats, but if you're pussy
We'll skin you like Brazilian Wax
A lotta cats die flossin'
Bitches shed tears for years cause you got Paul Pierced in my Boston

[Hook] [Big Shug]
Boston, aye
My Boston, ho
My town
My Boston, hey
My Boston, ho
"Reppin' Boston"
My town
My Boston, hey
My Boston, ho
My Boston, hey
"Reppin' Boston"

[Verse Three] [Termanology]
One two
Jeah, it's the L-A-W-T-O-W-N
Law-town, niggas done it again
Let me tell you 'bout my city
It's wild gritty
I got a hundred and fifty spics that ride with me
Wanna know 'bout crooked cops livin' in Boston?
Hit the block, bust a homie, cop get the pardon
You can learn about my Bean in Hi-D
These sirens in my dreams
It's a wild scene
Mamas in the street pick up their son, like "Why me? "
No I.D., the boy got stuck like I.V.s
Throw my threes, these wild streets, can't retire me
On my beats, they all bang, like I signed with Preem
Legendary like, Paul Pierce in the wheelchair
Lotta cats hatin' on me, but I'm still here
From Hell-town, back to Mattapan Square
Beware!
What a wonderful place to live

[Hook] [Big Shug]
Boston, aye
My Boston, ho
My town
My Boston, hey
My Boston, ho
"Reppin' Boston"
My town
My Boston, hey
My Boston, ho
My Boston, hey
"Reppin' Boston"
