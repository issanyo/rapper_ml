Here we go with the periodic rap
114 its a real long track
It will be done by group of column
By far the hardest thing I've done all autumn

First off we got the alkali metals
But so soft you'll never use em as a pedal
Lithium sodium potassium rubidium
Cesium francium ionise to plus one

Earth metals next thats what were classing
Because with water they all be reacting
Beryllium magnesium calcium for your bones
Strontium barium radium but not chrome

Now we got the transition metals
Some of these you could find in your pedal
Manganese titanium vanadium chromium zinc
Scandium cobalt iron nickel copper sinks
Yttrium zirconium and niobium
Molybdenum and check my technetium
Ruthenium rhodium and also silver
Palladium and cadmium could make you iller
Hafnium tantalum iridium ain't light
Rhenium osmium tungsten makes it bright
For the chains theres platinum and gold
Mercury is used to tell if its cold
Rutherfordium after ernest you get it
Dubnium exists but its purely synthetic
Seaborgium is hard to get to like heaven
Bohrium actually belongs to group seven
Hassium and meitnerium they are what's next
Copernicium's namesake is what you'd expect
Darmstadtium and roentgenium check it
That's the d-block safe to say that i wrecked it

Now were moving down to lanthanides
F-subshell is where their electrons reside
Lanthanum cerium praseodymium
Neodymium promethium samarium
Europium gadolinium and terbium
Dysprosium holmium and erbium
Thulium ytterbium and lutetium
Other mcs on the mic i'm wrecking them
Nobody else can rap the periodic table
I know if every element is or isn't stable

So now were moving down a single row
Whos bombing you man just listen while i flow
Actinides were in japan's reactor
Now the radiation is spreading slow like a tractor
Actinium is why they're called actinides
Thorium isn't really thor in disguise
Uranium was in the bomb that dropped
Instantly 75 000 hearts stopped
Protactinium is what came before that
Neptunium is crazier than borat
Theres plutonium and americium
Curium and also berkelium
Californium was first made out in cali
Einsteinium was not found in an alley
Theres fermium and medelvium
Nobelium and lawrencium
This finishes off the craziest names
So now lets not keep the beat the same

I only got about 33 left
Some could say that on the mic my aim is always to impress
Sit back now as breeze through the rest
We're starting from the top of group three
Aluminum boron and I'm Austin D
Galium thalium and indium
This is chemistry we dont study no pendulum
Carbon silicon germanium and tin
Lead flerovium and nitrogen
Phosphorous arsenic and antimony
Theres bismuth fluorine chlorine and bromine
Now were going back cause i missed group 6
Sulfur and selenium will actuate my lisp
With no oxygen I would be greatly missed
Tellurium polonium and number 116
Livermorium, now its the nobel gases
A full octet keeps them unreactive

Helium argon and xenon
Theres krypton radon and also neon
Im sorry for going a little out of order
Almost every element from the stars to our water
Hold up, wait, theres three that i missed
Astatine and iodine which comes out in your piss
Now the element which makes up the sun
I know its got atomic mass of one
So on the count of 1, 2, 3
I want everybody to shout it out with me
Cause right about now were at the end
1, 2, 3, hydrogen
