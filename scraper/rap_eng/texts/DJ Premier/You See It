We doing some real high fa looting around here
Ain't they? Huh
You know I just you know
I need the world to see you know where my life been at you know I mean
Since whenever you know what I'm talking about
You know,Brooklyn style on some pimping
You know we do that thing over here too
You underdig Church

(VERSE 1:Wais P)
Pull up in the Lincoln, pulling a Lebron
Miami,two Heat players in my palm
Two 38's send ya to the pearly gates
Sentenced to an early fate
Its an early case
Its all Pimping
I seen it all through my laser vision
My mission, to keep it real with no condition
My addition,the Escalade with the new Edition
Wood grain wheel I pop off when I peel
Zebras on my feet,Premo on the beat(Yep!)
Crocodile mics, pimpin' it saved my life
And I'm no bitter
Holiday I throw a no hitter
I keep a b**ch that swallow, A no spitter
I don't follow no n**ga
Piano wire around your throat n**ga
I'm a go getter go figure
The sawed off trigger, will get your arm gnawed off by the pimpster
Mister
(HOOK:DJ Premier/Wais P)
You See It
Baby come on in
I brought the gangsters,the hustlers,the players & pimps
Cause I walk like a pimp,talk like a mack
You See It
Baby come on in
I brought the gangsters,the hustlers,the players & pimps
And you handle your business I'm oh so proud of you
(VERSE TWO:Wais P)
I bet you thought I was play pimping
I stay winning,rock linen
Staying low in the truck with your h*
Let her blow on my n***
Two finger Spock style
One in her p*** one in her b***
Live long and prosper
Fitted on,Artful Dodger
Space Jam kicks
No space jam sh**,Just Gators
All Flavors
Come through the spot and make the papers
Ain't that Wais P the kid from The Ranjahz?
Yeah
Always moving forward,on to the next
Had to start pimping b**ches,hated waiting on them checks
Now I get that money out that latex
No boo
Thousand dollar tip to the waitress
Who you
Think you are?,Baby girl I'm a star
In New York and that Vegas
My stones like lasers
And for the right wages
I'll have you turning more tricks
Than Cirque du soleil is,or Blue Man group
Only difference is, you got to bring me back that loot
Put this pimping in your life to tailor make that suit
Call me entrepreneur,no entrapan**ga
Steven Corn minks but the collar chinchilla
California closets with the cedar oak pillars
For real'a,my house in Jerz look like a villa
I'm really just a mack but my swag scrams killer
I'm oh so proud of you
(HOOK:DJ Premier/Wais P)
You See It
Baby come on in
I brought the gangsters,the hustlers,the players & pimps
Cause I walk like a pimp,talk like a mack
You See It
Baby come on in
I brought the gangsters,the hustlers,the players & pimps
And you handle your business I'm oh so proud of you
(VERSE 3:Wais P)
Promethazine flow,gymnasium dough
The sh*t keep flipping,Uncle Chuck keep cripping
Khadaff Soo Woo you n**gas do you
I'm a stay on a b**ch that's how I'm getting rich
I'm a stay a hundred proof in Gucci rain boots
And thank god for them n**gas that aimed and ain't shoot
Usual suspects, you n**gas suspect
You see the pimping getting money now you upset
(HOOK:DJ Premier/Wais P)
You See It
Baby come on in
I brought the gangsters,the hustlers,the players & pimps
Cause I walk like a pimp,talk like a mack
You See It
Baby come on in
I brought the gangsters,the hustlers,the players & pimps
