[Verse 1 - Jayden]
Write my rhymes in the car because my dad's so loud
Never been the type of son that makes my family proud
All they saw in my eyes was always evil and greed
But I learnt a special woman was all that I need
I got the girl who loves me and I love her back
I'm not afraid to speak it that's a straight up fact
I will admit I like holding her soft hands
She's the reason why I scrapped my risky robbery plan
I needed better ways to expand my wealth
Real sick of stashing twenty's up behind the shelf
So I thought I'd play it safe and get a real job
Dealing got me paranoid, I was praying to god
I was only fifteen, my state of mind was inclined
Wanted to reach higher, fuck working full/part time
I once bought a Cuban link gold chain
Everyone I knew thought that I was insane
Dropped out after tenth back at Varsity College
I learnt that studying grades aren't the key to knowledge
Didn't really give a fuck about humiliation
True signs of intelligence is imagination
Einstein taught me that, so scum step back
Because imagination is a skill that you lack
The key opens up a mind to success and power
But you're still in school, I'm working twelve bucks an hour
My bank was stacking up, I thought I'd be quite pleased
Realised this isn't who I really wanted to be
Guys' I use to know now, rocking Ralph Lauren Polo's
I'm repping the same hoodie I wore three years ago
Never spent as much as I thought I would
Even though there's no doubt that I actually could
The gold fitting rims on the new flashy car
And I'm sitting in my Camry writing sixteen bars

[Verse 2 - Ritchie]
Verse two, now what the fuck I do?
Do I talk about growing up with my crew?
This is the truth - this is what is real
I may be a buster but I don't do no deals
Now, growing up in my house I was always told to go out
To look for a job or see what I'm about
I figured with my homie - to be in the game:
It's all about expressing, it's not about the fame
Scheming off the top yo, I ain't never figured
That starting this off we would need to pull triggers
Struggling on this path, I'm pulling all the switches
Tryna' find a ride for the road to the riches
Hoping that this road won't even fade
Cos' I don't like to dream about getting paid
And they called 'Next!', I believe that's me
They call me MC Rice and I'm grooving to this beat
Well, I'mma grab this mic and rhyme to this melody
Rapping with my boy, yeah we'll show you how it's meant to be
Time to hit the switch and kick it old school
Back in the days just like when there were no rules
I release lyrics smooth and incredible
Guaranteed to come up hard cos' I said it will
Many try but they look illiterate
So when I try you can stay shook and jitter-ish
Cos' my style is straight old school, isn't it?
Hey yo, consider it, Facebook and Twitter it
I'm not playing so listen and pay attention
As I take you to a whole new dimension
Now this shit might not blow up til' we really go in
Protons electrons always cause explosions

[Outro: Ritchie]
That last line meant peace for all of y'all that didn't get it
Peace
