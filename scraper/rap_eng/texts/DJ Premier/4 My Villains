[Intro: robFIVE]

It's for my Villains though.. (SHOT)

VVVIIILLLLLLAAAIIINNN

(That's weird.... bbooiinngg)

It's for my Villains though

[Verse: robFIVE]

Man I promise... Y'all ain't' ever been on my level
I'm so high I could change my name to Rob Angel

But I've been rapping like a devil for so long... you see the schedule
No time on my bezel for a rebel

If it ain't' about the moohlah I just tell ya' "kick pebbles."
We the Villains, real-life Goodfellas

Rap hella Frank White with light skin like Marshall
You just gotta marvel at a maven when his arsenal is so effective

Flow amazing and it's so respected
Every time I pass GO I get dough collected

Every time I tell a bitch "No!" they feel so rejected...
Like I didn't know that pussy was a weapon, HA!

You trying to make nothing of something that I got goin'...
Like I sold my  soul to know a whole lot you not knowin'

You better let it go like you got Frozen
Hot boy Feverelli got chosen and you know it, HA!

ONE. There's so much drama where I live
TWO.. Y'all stay rappin' bout the shit you never did

THREE... Only Real Ones on my team and I would take one for my team
Even when we disagree... we in agreement about Family...

How we all respond to tragedy. I'm rapidly adjusting my strategy to become your majesty

Majestic throw-back raps come up like no gravity
Presidential Roleys can get you mouth like a cavity

That's why I wear my jewelry at Tom Foolery's
Or Talk of The Town. You hear me talking you down?

You just some dog food and I'm a great dane
What up Dane?! Come through with the cocaine!

Back when Double AA changed his name to Drew Cobain
We was poppin' something with the cham to feel no pain

I got no taste on Opposite Day
And you will not get in my way. I'm bout to pop one for the Bay. THIZ
