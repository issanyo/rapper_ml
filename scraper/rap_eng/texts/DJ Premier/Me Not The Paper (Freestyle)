[Cuts by Tony Touch]
Now you stepped to A.G. you get your ass-kicked

[Verse 1: A.G.]
Put us together and that's danger so don't mess with it
Niggas copied the pattern so the best part you'll never get
D.I.T.C, strong on some extra shit
Claiming our spot in the Bronx right next to Chris
Now we original from the lords to the gangsters
From the righteous, to the criminals, they thank us, rank us
Top seat so just imagine how we have 'em
Indeed, I sport fatigues but not for fashion
In God's name, I grab mics and create flames
And blaze shit, leave em in amazement, with basics
Face it, I'm the dopest in here
Checkin' for the second baddest bitch, cause the first is who I came with
I keep 'em fiendin', so Tony Touch play it again
We got 'em leanin', like some weed that's rated a 10
You sport the ice and rock the Roley, I done that
But here's a jewel a nigga once told me, run that
It's real feeling steel up on yo back
Listen closely, now I tote gacts for shit like that
On a rise to the top
They wanna take what we got
But a law, is the master plan now so let's plot
Front, like my shit ain't hot, I'll go bananas
Similar to scanners, on some unidentified shit

[Outro: A.G.]
No doubt, D.I.T.C
