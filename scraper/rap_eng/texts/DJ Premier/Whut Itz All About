[Intro: Scratches by DJ Premier]
"Okay, get ready now. Here he comes"
"No doubt, you don't know what it's about"
"Let me tell you what it's all about"

[Verse 1]
You ain't never been a hustler or been to jail
You ain't nothing but a buster and I can tell
By the tone of your voice and that rinky dink gold
You're talking a mile a minute and gangsters talk in code
Demented and crazed, the nigga has issues
Pistols get used in case the rent's past due
You getting paper, well man, I ain't asked you
And guess what, my block does numbers
To the point, 5-0 set a mobile home on my corner
It's a mini police station, I work around the situation
I got an appetite for destruction
Sco knows the consequence [?] is full of corruption
What I supposed to stop grinding 'cause it's hot, that's the wrong assumption
Take a block, set up shop, I can't stop pumping
Smokers won't stop coming
I ain't buying no food or clothes 'til this block starts jumping

[Hook: Scratches by DJ Premier]
"No doubt, you don't know what it's about"
"Going against the kid"
"Coldchain jack"
"Yeah"
"That's how we get down"
"Let me tell you what it's all about"

[Verse 2]
Nigga, watch what you say, don't you hear that echo over the phone
The police is already watching the house
We hustle in the middle of a school zone, how we don't love the kids?
Can I help that at recess they learn how [?] pop up at my dope crib?
Coldchain the medicine man, I give 'em a fix
Black sedan, Grand Marquis
Same as the cops so they can't mark me
See I've seen people turn soda cans into [?]
And niggas hop out of vans with bad intentions
Get straight taken away
Until this day, I never saw 'em again
Like camouflage, I blend in
Some say I talk about too much death and gunplay
Bitches suck dick for weed and pills
Deals gone bad, connects get killed

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
You're talking too much, it appears you're light in the ass and heavy in the mouth
Me? Write with my cash and kicking it south
My current connect is currently living down in San Antonio, Texas
Forty-five an ounce, 400 a pound
Ramon, give me 20 of them things so I can bounce
But if Ramon think I'm a dummy like I can't count
Start to act funny about my business, Im'ma take him out
I'm in the block vacating
Alleviating situations as fast as I can
I'll send you pussies on a permanent vacation
[?] this time of the year
Heard it feels like Hell right now, Im'ma send your ass right down
So you can have a sit-down with Satan right now
I have no fears, I embrace death with cocked 4-pound
To blow his black hood right now
Y'all ain't making no noise, Coldchain's in your corner [?] my drugs of choice
Cool, calm, and collective so I'm never losing my poise
Conversate with my mac so I'm never losing my voice, nigga
I stay strapped

[Hook 2x]
