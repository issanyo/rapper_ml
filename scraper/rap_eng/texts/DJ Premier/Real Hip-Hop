[Hook]
To the hiddip the hop ya don't stop (don't stop)

[Verse 1: Krazy Drayz]
Well on your mark and get set, can't forget to go
In case you didn't know the flow is Fat like Joe (like Joe)
Yo, you niggedy-know that I'm back, man
You're wack man, I eat a rapper like I'm Pac Man
I briggedy-bring it, straight from the cellar
Fo' realla, packin' more hits than Lou Piniella
I swell a, nigga in his eye if he test me
You don't impress me, a-yo Books kick the rest, G
Uhh, one time for your mind...

[Verse 2: Skoob]
Ayo, what up? It's the crew bringing the ruckus, no doubt
We's the roughest dream team, Reign Supreme like a Cutlass
Getting duckets, the dough, you can't touch the flow
It's me, the nigga wit' G, the B double O K-S
So say yes and bust your caliber
When I pop shit and rock shit like Metallica
Stakes through the hearts of them snake fake niggas
Them all up in my face, jealous of my tape niggas
So honey shake your figures and show me whatcha got
(Blow the spot) Das EFX with the Real Hip-Hop

[Chorus]
To the hiddip the hop ya don't stop (don't stop)
Das EFX with the real hip-hop (hip hop)
To the hiddip the hop ya don't quit (don't quit)
Das EFX and we came to rip shit (rip shit)
To the hiddip the hop ya don't stop (don't stop)
Das EFX with the real hip-hop (hip hop)
To the hiddip the hop ya don't quit (don't quit)
Das EFX and we came to rip shit (rip shit)

[Verse 3: Skoob]
Iggedy-okie-dokie
Next nigga to quote me
I hope he got more Miracles than Smokey
Won't be no discussion, strictly head crushing
Lead rushin' through your body
You're in my Dangerfield like Rodney
Howdy, I'll back up in that ass, G, kaplowie
And now we got the game to a Tee like Howie
Allow me, to introduce myself and my peeps
Straight from the sewer, stayin' true to the streets

[Verse 4: Krazy Drayz]
Well it's me, Krazy Drayz, bringin' up the rear
I swear, we got to Hold It Down e'ry year
So there, let me crack a beer and kick my feet up
Turn the heat up and smiggedy-smoke all the weed up
Kids I eat up, wit' a style that's the newest
My crew is, getting more run than Carl Lewis
It's from the sewers now ya see me on the top
So stop and recognize the niggas on ya block

[Chorus]
To the hiddip the hop ya don't stop (don't stop)
Das EFX with the real hip-hop (hip hop)
To the hiddip the hop ya don't quit (don't quit)
Das EFX and we came to rip shit (rip shit)
To the hiddip the hop ya don't stop (don't stop)
Das EFX with the real hip-hop (hip hop)
To the hiddip the hop ya don't quit (don't quit)
Das EFX and we came to rip shit (rip shit)

[Verse 5: Skoob]
Ayo, MC's is irrelevant, and delicate to the texture
But this style of mine is well defined like Webster
Ainâ€™t a badder nigga raw from the jaw than the Jabber-Jibber
When I get Stone like Sharon from Sliver
Equipped to riggedy-rip the microphone to shreds
Dread, yo come and hit these niggas in the head

[Verse 6: Krazy Drayz]
Well I connect my rhymes like Lego, so l'eggo my Eggo
I burn ya like Waco, you need more than Maaco
I take it to ya crew and keep 'em moving like I'm U-Haul
I'm here to school y'all figgedy-faggots like RuPaul
I throw a screwball and strike out the MC
And if he temps me, I knock em out like Jack Dempsey
I burn some sensi and chase it wit' a Guinness
The illest, now hit me with the hook because I'm finished

[Chorus]
To the hiddip the hop ya don't stop (don't stop)
Das EFX with the real hip-hop (hip hop)
To the hiddip the hop ya don't quit (don't quit)
Das EFX and we came to rip shit (rip shit)
To the hiddip the hop ya don't stop (don't stop)
Das EFX with the real hip-hop (hip hop)
To the hiddip the hop ya don't quit (don't quit)
Das EFX and we came to rip shit (rip shit)
To the hiddip the hop ya don't stop (don't stop)
Das EFX with the real hip-hop (hip hop)
To the hiddip the hop ya don't quit (don't quit)
Das EFX and we came to rip shit (rip shit)
