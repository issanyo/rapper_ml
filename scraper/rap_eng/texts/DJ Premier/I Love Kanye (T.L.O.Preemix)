[Intro: samples and scratches]
"Any luck?"
"No, but we're not giving up
I'd like to come back again"
"Anytime, just let us know"
"You know, the Lord works in a different way
Way different than we understand
Why? I don't know"
Mi-Mi-Mi-Mi-Mi-Mr. West
Mi-Mi-Mr. West

[Verse: Kanye West]
I miss the old Kanye, straight from the 'Go Kanye
Chop up the soul Kanye, set on his goals Kanye
I hate the new Kanye, the bad mood Kanye
The always rude Kanye, spaz in the news Kanye
I miss the sweet Kanye, chop up the beats Kanye
I gotta to say, at that time I'd like to meet Kanye, Kan, Kan, Kan, Kanye, Kanye, Kanye, ye, ye, ye
See I invented Kanye, it wasn't any Kanyes
And now I look and look around and there's so many Kanyes
I used to love Kanye, I used to love Kanye
I even had the pink Polo, I thought I was Kanye
What if Kanye made a song, about Kanye?
Called "I Miss The Old Kanye," man that would be so Kanye
That's all it was Kanye, we still love Kanye
And I love you like Kanye loves Kanye
