[Verse 1: Lil Dap]
Son started in Brooklyn and you all know that
I call you son for a reason
That means nothing can come between us
When we walk this beat, lyrics do get deep
Because we're born to die, shed tears and cry
Mom dukes passed away when you was locked up, son
They had you, suspended in time, so I kick rhymes
Niggas livin' off your fears and ideas to get paid
Brothas maintain your balance and protect your wealth
And these punk style niggas screamin' out for help
And there's nothin' in this world better than life itself

[Verse 2: Melachi]
Young fools break rules, mic tools got me open
I'm smokin', leavin' all the punk rappers broken
No jokin', hoping for the best
East to west, I'm like a killer puttin' rappers in their rest
'Cause there's no tricks, when I let off clips
I leave bodies in ditches, play bitch niggas like bitches
Nutcracker doin hits by the dozen
When I make moves, I ride the train with my cousin
Nowhere near simple
My mental, flex more complex than Mozart's instrumental
From my temple, comes a bad sign
And if you're doin' that, you're suspended in time

[Scratched Chorus (Repeat 4X)]
Don't talk the talk if you can't walk the walk
The crew bringin' the ruckus no doubt

[Verse 3: Lil Dap]
Yo son, I think about my soul 'cause your shell is just a frame
Only used for money, hustlin' and playin the game
I want my chance to live long, what, like Marvin Gaye
I may be dead and gone, but my word will be born
This is for my niggas and chicks who live in the ghetto
We'll walk the...streets of gold, diamond, pearls, and girls
And there's nothin' better than this 'cause we're in the new world
Seeing people everywhere that I thought I saw before
Check it out party people as we reign supreme
Yo the Group Home manifest and got mad love for the team

[Verse 4: Melachi]
I know that it's tough comin' up in the streets
You will be strong because you can't be weak
You gotta put your mind on achieve mode
Go for your goals, boom boom explode
Everybody's in the way but they can't hold you back
That's how it is and we do it like that
Yeah...so...show 'em what you got
No time for fakin' moves, the time is wastin' on the clock
You know how I rock, I rock non-stop
Hop on stage, you jump on my jock
Here's a dope rhyme, one time for your mind
If you're deaf, dumb, and blind, you're suspended in time

[Scratched Chorus (Repeat 4X)]
Don't talk the talk if you can't walk the walk
The crew bringin' the ruckus no doubt

Don't talk the talk if you can't walk the walk (Repeat 4X)
