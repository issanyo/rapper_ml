[Intro: Nas]
"Represent to the fullest"
Let's represent forever
"Represent"
We gon represent forever
"Represent"
I will represent forever
"Represent"
Yeah, say what?
What you say?
"Represent"
What we do?
"Represent"
Represent

[Verse 1: Nas]
Any day could be your last in the jungle
Get murdered on a humble, guns'll blast, niggas tumble
The corners is the hot spot, full of criminals
Who don't care, guzzling beers, we all stare
At the out-of-towners, they better break North
Before we get the four pounders and take their face off
The streets is filled with undercovers
Homicide chasing brothers
The D's on the roof tryin' to watch us and lock us
And killer coppers even come through in helicopters
I drink a little vodka, spark a L and hold a Glock
For the fronters, wannabe ill niggas and spot runners
Thinking it can't happen 'til I trap 'em and clap 'em
And leave 'em done, won't even run about
I don't believe in none of that shit, your facts are backwards
Nas is a rebel of the street corner
Pulling a TEC out the dresser; police got me under pressure

[Chorus: Nas]
Represent, represent
Represent, represent
Represent, represent
Represent, represent
Yeah

[Verse 2: Nas]
Yo, they call me Nas, I'm not your legal type of fella
Moët drinking, marijuana smoking street dweller
Who's always on the corner, rolling up blessed
When I dress, it's never nothing less than Guess
Cold be walking with a bop and my hat turned back
Love committing sins and my friends sell crack
This nigga raps with a razor, keep it under my tongue
The school drop-out, never liked the shit from day one
‘Cause life ain't shit but stress, fake niggas, crab stunts
So I guzzle my Hennessy while pulling on mad blunts
The brutalizer, crew de-sizer, accelerator
The type of brother who be pissing in your elevator
Somehow the rap game reminds me of the crack game
Used to sport Bally's and Cazals with black frames
Now I'm into fat chains, sex and TECs
Fly new chicks and new kicks, Heines and Beck's

[Chorus: Nas]
I represent y'all
I represent y'all
I represent y'all

[Verse 3: Nas]
This is what it's about
Before the BDP conflict with MC Shan
Around the time when Shante dissed the Real Roxxane
I used to chill on the corner, on the block
Every day's a different...that had us running from cops
If it wasn't hanging out in front of cocaine spots
We was at the candy factory, breaking the locks
Nowadays, I need the cash in the hand just like the next man
Fuck a yard, God, let me see a hundred grand
Could use a gun, son, but fuck being the wanted man
But if I hit rock bottom then I'ma be the Son of Sam
Then call the crew to get live too, with Swoop
Bokeem, my brother Jungle, Big Bo cooks up the blow
Mike'll chop it; Mayo, you count the profit
My shit is on the streets, this way the Jakes'll never stop it
It's your brain on, to all fly bitches and thugs
'Nuff respect to the projects, I'm ghost, one love

[Chorus: Nas]
I represent y'all
I represent y'all
I represent y'all
I represent y'all

[Outro: Nas]
This one goes
This one goes
To the Queen rich crew, the 40 side of Vernon
The 41st side of Vernon, The Goodfellas
My man Cee-Lo from the Don, Lakey the Kid
My whole crew, Big Dove
[?] yeah baby
To my whole crew from the Northside, from the Southside
Way out the [?] projects
[?] Wood
The whole Long Island city, we here baby (we here)
And of course to you D.C
"Represent"
"Represent"
"Represent"
"Represent"
"Represent"
Yeah
"Represent"
Yeah
"Represent"
Yeah
Oh, we represent to
Represent to the fullest
Represent to the fullest
