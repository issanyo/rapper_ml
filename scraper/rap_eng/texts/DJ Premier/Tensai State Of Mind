[Verse: Arkh Zeus]
Gather around, settle down, and sit down
There's lots of room in this church to preach about Zeus' greatness
Unnecessary to discuss it towards the public
No one's above him and when he spits the crowd goes ape shit
Practical crack to these simpletons
Even though what I say doesn't make sense to them
They still give me eminence
15, but lyrically infinite in age
What can I say? I read and my favourite MC's Lupe
But enough of the modesty, I am my own favourite
Words dangling from the verbal rope I use when I'm strangling
Anyone that thinks they compare to me
There ain't no sparing thee
I'm sly, the cops ain't came to me
No suspicion, I keep it low key, I'm just kidding, do you get it?
Oh you don't? Either it is or it isn't
I'll never tell, you'll just have to figure out yourself
I hope you do and don't, cause that means you'll understand me, but I'll be in jail
I had to dumb it down for the judges
Don't wanna be pleaded guilty of 3rd degree lyrical combustion
Forget this discussion, most that took a listen just doesn't
Comprehend, no need to pretend that you do cause you'll amount to nothing
That's right, I'm in my permanent prime
Sublime rhyming when I'm in a tensai state of mind
Perfectly perfecting all of my rhymes, line for line
And no it won't be long before my time comes to shine
