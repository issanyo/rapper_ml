[Hook: James Franken] x2
I ain't even standin' but I'm feelin' tall
Y'ain't even listen but you heard me call
Most of y'all are like fish in this pool of sharks
These dudes is hard
Who'da Thought?

[Verse 1: ?henom and James Franken]
[?henom]
The wickedest rap out
I di-r-ect flows to show my fans how
I ran cowards tracks into the sand
[James Franken]
And I pass the planet to the left of me
Two bitches tryna get the best of me
They fed me ecstasy
The rest is history
[?henom]
I got the illest imagery
Spit impeccable Vectors
Flow in sectors
Man these hoes look delectable...
[James Franken]
Like edibles
I manifest to keep my sanity
See the can that he handin' me
This is my life and yo' fantasy
This why you fans of me
[?henom]
The grams are anti gravity
Grabbin' me floatin'
Like a coast guard saves you out the ocean
I'm stayin' open
[James Franken]
I'm dose dosin'
Lyric leg droppin' those that oppose
Like Hulk Hogan
I'm a Mac but this is mo' dope, man
I'm only boastin' because it shows that I can kill quick
Even when I'm in slow-motion I'm so focused
Never gonna stop the flow
Iron like a monocle
Horizon full of obstacles for those that's un-accountable
On the counter like my fruit
That shit is bountiful
But it ain't gonna hold me back from gettin' that pound of gold
Most rappers in the state got me not likin' sounds of those
'cept for the select crews
Y'all know who you are

[Verse 2: ?henom]
We be the game changin'
Dame bangin'
Bank breakin'
I'm fuckin' tracks up with my cracka James Franken
Flu flow
Force of sumo
Source of a pseudo
Psycho livin' inside a simmerin' pot of
Fluent Might doe
Atonement of a Minnesotan
Glowin' when the winter wind is
Blowin' me a frozen scope
Of scene off in the moment
With more sides dodecahedrons when spittin' awesome shit
Droppin' talk I wrote a lotta thoughts down on my poppin' script
Rippin' like cotton spittin' 'em quick them noggins bobbin'
I'm Astonishin'
They Like ma'fucka you need oxygen!
Coch-r-ane, Johnny
Slick in my talk
My simple system is take the lyrics and twist 'em
'Round the snare and kick drum
Ma'fuckas these days think it's bout gettin' paid
But gimme mics and Molly
I'll turn the stage to a rave
And I Rage Against the Machine
Guerrilla Radio tactics
Stadiums gon' be crackin'
Like brews when it fuckin' happens
