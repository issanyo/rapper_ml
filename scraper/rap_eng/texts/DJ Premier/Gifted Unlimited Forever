[Napoleon Da Legend verse 1]
Who benefits from gurus legacy? Pac’s legacy?
Big L, Pun and Biggie's legacy?
Guru got a stronger catalog than Biggie don’t he?
Biggies one of the G.O.A.T.s, it’s deeper than just Diddy
So what is it really? could we speak truth without offending?
Fuck who I offend cause Guru's never mentioned
Maybe Guru was too positive
Cause In Hip-Hop when crime ain’t glorified
People are horrified
Either you "whorified" or branded as a boring guy
Peddling sex gun and drugs’ll have you soaring high
Hip-Hop is more like an adolescent child grew up from being an infant and it’s essence died
Maybe Guru's watching staring from the heavens skies
The business might try to distract but legends never die
And ya voice was so important to us
A source to us in the form of hope to us

[Napoleon Da Legend verse 2]
Monotonous flow but so emotional
This tapes for the heads only promotional
And it’s a great honor for me to pay homage
To the Mount Rushmore of Hip-hop scholars
Peace to Preem too both of y’all a great gift
Gotta give our people their roses while they live
Regardless of whom, we’ll all be gone soon
Hard to find inner peace when living in monsoon
Shout out to the coons cause y’all got a job too
Play the tunes, they tell u to play you bafoons
We keeping it a buck on this side
We used to it no matter how rough it get on this side
Cause you’ll never win living a lie, you gave it a try
You gonna pay for every single head u took for a ride
I’ll be bumping that classic Gang Starr in my Tesla car
Sleep In peace Keith Elam, bless the God
