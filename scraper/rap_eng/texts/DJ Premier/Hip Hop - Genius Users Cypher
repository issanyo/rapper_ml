[Intro: ]


[Verse 1: BS-Calrissian]
Take my shining I will shine bright with a light test
Take my rhyming I will rhyme right with a mic check
On hot mic's I quite wreck, destroying these hype tracks
And on top I get right back, was shaking for slight secs
Till I rock with the sure shot, bars I sure drop
Wait till the beat stops, than catch a full shock
While spit wreck I think not, no gun I don't lick shots
In love with the Hip Hop, one quote from the Chief Rock
"Hip Hop and Rap yeah that's where my hearts at"
I rock all the rows front to back at the concert
Wait a sec, I forgot I don't got none of those yet
Don't worry bout that, will happen since I ain't wack
Back on track, I like to really focus on the love
Not the random hocus pocus but the love from above
The one that only comes from spending time but building trust
I'd like to show you mine, it's what I got, that's a must

[Verse 2: ThaHipHopHead]
Coming in headstrong could you leave dead wrong
Gun sung a lead song to my opponent, now he’s forever gone
I wanna see someone challenge my spot, your talent is not
As grand as mine, you’ll land a fine just for not acknowledging hot
Lyricists, like me, you’re feisty, then fight me
I’ll smite thee with lightning, indict me, I might be-
Come the new OJ, run up on you like “Oh, hey”
Don’t front with the bullshit or I’ll go “Olé!”
Coming with the style that’ll make oldheads go “He’s wild”
With a single pace, complete a journey of a thousand miles
My influence is like Scarface mixed with John Gotti
Shot to the dome makes your hair red like Yatchy
Hip hop is this spot where I complete what you cannot
The wrist watch is opposite of hot, cold to you bitch thots
Shout to DJ Premier, and shout out to Mos Def too
The illest of their kind, don’t make me blow lead at you

[Verse 3: gamemast15r]
Hip Hop, that’s the shit
What makes you motherfuckers think that being wack is sick?
How many motherfuckers do I have to slay on wax?
When premo bringing the beat in and I lay the raps
Bitch you thirsty, please grab the drano
Kill yourself now cause you ain’t taking my pesos
This D-O Double G shit boy you better lay low
Either get the fuck down or stay out of my way though
Like Tony Montana on the banana boat, Harry B with the Day O
Bring the pistol to your grill, on the end a potato
See the Feds? I know all the shit that they know
No surprises, no demise, philosophize like I’m Plato
I craft my words like I’m using the play dough
It takes two trucks in total to move all of this base ho
And I don’t need a soldier boy to hit you with the Draco

[Verse 4: Almighty U-Sorcerer]
The one you frightened to trade bars with
Young and almighty, I'm steady working a graveyard shift
Nowadays, it seem like everybody passing away
Those the niggas that I was chilling with back in the day
My uncle death hit me like a slap in the face
They look at me wrong, we staring back in their face
Those the same motherfuckers who done stabbed in the back
Took it out and starting rhyming like Cat in the Hat
Ain't the type of nigga to go stomp you in a locker room
Rhyming like my name is Dr. Seuss, while in hot pursuit
Rhymes so sick, niggas thinking that I caught a flu
Niggas said they bodying the tracks, although I caught a few
I'm killing you M-F's and I ain't talking bout the Doctor Doom's
If you like talking to cops, then we don't talk to you
I can't even spit bars on the same track as you if your pockets small
Invite your bitch and we can kick it, soccer ball

[Verse 5: Sello TheRapper]

It was - only a matter of time before I was on premier
Bout tah spit the typa shit make gangsta rap look queer
Approaching wit my balls hanging like I got no fear
Eyes dried up can you spare a tear?
Shit i'm off bar on par
Spit some protons 4 bars
So hard i'm goyard
So screen shot and hang it on your mantel
Cerebral flow i'm aiming at your mental
Flow hot leave you burnt to the third DEGREE - ANGLE
On 90 so swerve RIGHT else your boy leave you mangled
I'm Rambo
So Cena John I seen a John so small you can't use the public John
So PSYCHO you can't tell which DELIC im on
Spell my name right im a demi god
Thats not to say that im rarely god
Im just an African wit some hot flows
Tighter than pussies at a pop show
Its that honcho- head
Superhuman so my saliva - lead
Ten shots to the dome imma leave ya - dead
So count your blessings while im steady just counting bread
Chickens on my phone im just countin heads
Two whites and one yellow - its time for my meds

[Verse 6: Corduroy Crook]
I've got questions While these niggas is testing
Lethal weapons dispensing
Bullets
In the form of life lessons
Its amazing how obsessed with the lights
They be
Are you moth or sheep?
Are you knife or tree?
See while I glimmer in the sun
I'm most effective in the night
You seem adept at throwing shade
But wilt away without the light
Simple to say it ain't ok where we come from
Where stories stay unsung
Wrong step and your done done
Might think they tall tales
But many faces fell short
Where do you find comfort
When it's not only the guns
That's taking the lives of first sons
It hurts to see another black hearse in the bronx
Why are mothers thutmose when they live in the dirt?
Is there always a moses when there's niggas in bondage?
Why are Winslows avoided yet they’re never responding?
Why can't no one explain why my brothers exploited?
They ain't respected the same (pause)
My niggas is pawns but it ain't a fair trade
They been running the triangle before phil played the game
Its insane
They keep passing broking bills but they expect us to change
I’ll be a broken record till not a single question remains

[Verse 7: Liiight]
Came out strong and fucked the game up
Way I spit straight flame made them change up
Bowser not bowing you Mario's get karted away
Bartered as slaves
Now you Yoshi's just some fucking trophies
Never choking cause I sip on potion
Eating good don't test my devotion
Split a spliff in half tell me what's the quotient
Slow motion steamrolling anybody trolling
Man of mystery mystifying the mystical mystics
Analytical watch the block to make a difference
Know some niggas who never lived to see a pension
Know some niggas who just craving some attention
No top flight but I shine this light on them
Long nights of henny trying to find the fight in them
They thought I had swag just spilled bleach on my denim
Fuck all the crowds
I walk and go get them
Telling the truth
I don't fear any villain
Massacred niggas who got in the way
Shame on the niggas who sold out for pay
Lawd
