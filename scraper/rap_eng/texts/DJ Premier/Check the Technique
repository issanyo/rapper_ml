[Produced By DJ Premier]

[Verse 1]
You puny protozoa, you're so minute you didn't know the
Gang has been watchin' but instead of just squashin' you
I'm scoopin' you up out of the muck you wallow in
Like a chief chemist, other scientists are followin'
Plannin' to examine you, on a petri dish
Sticking you and frickin' you, just a teenie bit
I'm clever, with science, but never relyin'
On false words from cowards who forever be tryin'
Insisting they come off, I let 'em get some off
Then come back wit drum tracks their ears could get numb off
Blockbustin', like makin' love, I'll never stop thrustin'
Into your system, so just listen
I'm like a neurosurgeon, operatin' wit a purer version
I write prescriptions, of words that fit in
The dope gets prescribed, as I kick it live
'Cause it's more than a style, it's conceptual genius
My effect on the scene is, to project that I mean this
You deadbeat, wait until you see my next feat
I get respect for the rep when I speak

[Verse 2]
I'm rushing you like a defensive end as I recommend
That you comprehend, I could stomp you in
A battle, contest, or war, what will occur
Will be the forfeiture, of your immature
Insecure for sure, meek, weak visions of grandeur
To rudely awaken you, I then'll be breakin' you
Taxin' without askin', attractin' a snake in you
Makin' you succumb to the drums of Gang Starr
By far we are, truly gifted ones, son
But if you were to speculate or estimate us losin'
You'll be dyin', tryin' to face the fate of your delusions
Cause miscalculation, is all you're statin'
So I'm chumpin', puntin' punks just like footballs
'Cause I wanna put y'all, back in the mess hall
To clean up the slop, and stop all the bullcrap
Your rap's crazy wack, so don't try to pull that
You're lackin' the vernacular, I'm slappin' ya and cappin' ya
And closin' your jaw, 'cause you can't mess with Gang Starr
The Guru and Premier always dope with the blessed beats
Dance your ass off, Hobbes, check the technique

[Verse 3]
"Bon voyage", "Sayonora", "Arrivederci"
Your ass gets busted, doodoo mustard, you tried to work me
You irked me, because you copy and falsify
And I don't care how many step up, 'cause you all could try
To wish and fish for a style, here's a fishing rod
These rhymes are hittin' hard, constantly I'm gettin' large
Inevitably, I readily kick a slew
Of lyrics so deep, so don't sleep, but just peep me
Puttin' methods on records and spinning for each millisecond
33 RPM's displays the art of men
And as my rhymin' builds you see my time it's chill...
And then I look upon weak ones
I'm teachin' each one so they become redone
Essays are relayed to twist you up like French braids
Or tied up like corn braids, 'cause I got a strong rage
Force like police raids to never be delayed
I once was the least paid but I made the grade
'Cause this ain't a slave sale and I ain't the same stale
Rapper, no, I'm not a phony microphonist with no class or
No type of real appeal or real - talent
And it makes me violent, man
To see all of these peewee bee MC wannabes
Making G's 'cause some dumb companies
Have lots of money but no idea of what is wack and what is dope
So check out what the Guru wrote
'Cause I will prevail, give you tales as I unveil
Have enough brain cells so I can stay paid well
Now I'm in the driver's seat, and rockin the liver beats
Bouncin' and boomin' and blastin' you to the next seat
Chic and unique with lots of kick like a cleat
