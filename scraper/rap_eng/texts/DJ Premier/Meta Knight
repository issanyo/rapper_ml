[Verse 1]

I'm blacker than coal, spit hot, blood is cold
Never caught, 7 assaults, not even a soul
Can be this fast, a hundred murders up in my ass
Ten thousand million dollars, all of it in cash
What the fuck I'm gon' do, two banks on my crew
Settin up a rendezvous, bring your deuce deuce
Stay watching because police is in the trail
But by definition they will never catch the prey
Leave a snitch nigga blind, and take his vocal chords
This is the meta shit that you were looking for
Yes i have sinned, maybe more than anyone
But fuck it i dont regret it, if I did I wouldn't be torn
I shouldn't been born, but my parents fucked up
Is that a blessing? I don't know, dont ask me, ask god
The key to success is to never look behind
Tonights de night, stay in watch for the Meta Knight

[Hook]

You know the Meta Knight keeps your body warmer
Cuz he spit hotter than the sun in a Bq's summer

[Verse 2]

Empire Earth says soma, sunte, they're attacking us
When I call EE it says "¿Sí, mi señor?"
You want me in your side cuz I'm a madman
Not even Batman can catch me with this master plan
Don't you ever trust a man who looks like he acts good
Cuz most of the times these men are the worst crooks
I know two, but it isn't the time for it
Right now just know, I'm coming for ya, you better run like Forrest
To the forest where I can't find you easy
You use yeezys, that's whack, you are quite sleazy
You teached me to never trust anybody
And I gon' teach you to never find me with a shotty
I'm out with shorty, repeat what you just said
Imma cut you up with this absolute meta blade
I'm the fucked up person you'll never want to find
Torné, the best mc, I'm the Meta Knight

[Hook]

[Outro]

Yeah, and you just heard the sounds, never pronounced, by me, Torné, the Meta Knight, yo, never forget my name
