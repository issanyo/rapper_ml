I’m at the inception
In the process of making in roads
B Complex see the pool out my window
Plus I got the U on my back Kellen Winslow
Ready for my Big Show I smackdown an intro
And ince you like this track now just take down my info
Here’s my card and pen if you want to scribble it out
A&R’s need more some more talent
Their’s fizzlin' out
Yes I’m Jim Carey with the lyrics
That I’m riddlin’ out
A.I. am The Answer
In the middle of doubt
But the ball’s in your court
I suggest you dribble it out
I’m hyperactive at the easel
I need Ritalin now
But I fear no evil
We just get rid of it now
MVP
Hip Hop’s Lebron
And I’m about to drop bombs like Iran
Going going gone
Barry Bonds with the vocab
Think the only difference is the size of my gonads
Ask Lance man he’s only got one
But..like him I have this chance to become
A legend in the game
Hip Hop lives on
No survival for the weak
So we live strong
See my key to success is not locked away
Yes I’ll get it done tomorrow if it’s not today
Watch me reinvent the game like Dr. J
I’m an ill artist
I need a Dr. Dre
‘Cause as far as great producers go
Merrick knows
I need a #1 track like Derrick Rose
Foes you hate my music
I don’t even know you
But if you give this a listen I can show you
Just exactly why you’re dead wrong
‘Cause I don’t run from my problems man I meet them head on
Me and you hater
It’s just us now
If you can’t stand this music
Sit the fuck down
Yes I’m lookin' presidential in my Uptowns
Air Force Ones if you didn’t get the reference
I’m just preachin’ to the choir who admires my presence
Like it’s Christmas
Life is vicious
It’s hard to grab hold of success, man, it’s slippery
But I can see a victory in my periphery
History converted to an mp3
My name is You MC
And I’m an MVP
