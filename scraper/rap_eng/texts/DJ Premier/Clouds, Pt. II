[Verse 1]
I ain’t really give a fuck, so why start now?
It’s been damn time that I came back in style
I’mma start right here, another classic instrumental
That everyone will criticize, acting all judgmental
If you’re so essential I’mma question your potential
Cause the game a sacred temple but you treat it like a rental
I ain’t a hip hop purist, I’m just sick of all the tourist
That act like their mixtape the greatest thing to exist
“Oh you think it’s good cause you found a trap beat
With the same old snares, 808 on repeat
That’s really so cool that you nailed that Migos flow
The same triplets all Atlanta rappers know.”
& then I got beef with all the rap lyricists
Use big words but ain’t ever really saying shit
“Oh you looked up synonyms and now you’re building pyramids?
Nobody can understand what the true vision is?.”
Except for you cause you’re living like you’re limitless
We can barely process all the knowledge that you’ve given us
Fuck you man, you ain’t bringing nothing new
& Nothing came to me because you put it into view
& don’t get me wrong I ain’t even in that category
Some motherfuckers act like ego’s a vocabulary
Then you sell yourself like you with us or against us
Here I was thinking that my shit was too pretentious
Music was my side-chick, but now we’re moving in together
Asking her for rent but she’s looking for a seller
It’s hard to have patience when you’re living under pressure
But you would understand if you had ever really met her
I made some introspective shit, made some fun shit
But it has to be good no matter which it is you pick
We all forever novice that’s one thing that I can promise
So treat me like I’m Nyck, addressing me with Caution
I tend to do this often one could even say it’s common
The fruits of your labor, make sure they aren’t rotten
I woke up feeling cocky cause my raps are not a hobby
Fuck your label lobby I ain’t trynna be a copy
The way I rap, shit, it ain’t even gonna sell
So today I think and ask where I’d like my own cell
Whether freshman in college or freshman XXL
But I’m saying farewell because my art posted bail
I'm trynna be Gambino as he distances from
Rap
I probably wouldn’t be here if it wasn’t for his Camp
Product of my idols, trynna make them all my rivals
I’m trynna be the best so I’ll see them at the finals
& all these written verses are my version of the Bible
We caring ‘bout the others ‘till we all become entitled
Our music going down the stream, we hit by the tidal
Support our prophets but we ain’t buy the vinyls
It’s in their own profit that we see them as vital
Sometimes it might be the case but other times we’re lied to
So why can’t Yachty and Joe both be the culture?
It’s some of y’all imitating actin’ like vultures
Eating off a dead sound all of y’all ruined
Whatever you gotta do to bring that money to fruition
But if that’s your motivation then your shit ain’t art
Sorry to burst your bubble but things fall apart
I’m on this track alone but best believe that it’s a start
I’m dreaming of a day that a song breaks the charts
Yeah that’s a stretch, quite a bit far fetched
But I rather play the game than be sitting on the bench
Just trynna chase your dreams before you let em die
Cause you tend to leave em all like you left them out to dry
& another comes around and he tries to buy your mind
& now you seem to go blind like those contracts that your signed
So now you’re all inclined to always stay way far behind
Became a part of a system that ain’t ever spared a dime
& yeah my flow generic, treat the beat like an epic
My odyssey, hope you hear every lyric
The way I feel now, I’ll do more than watch the throne
Refrain from throwing stones, please don’t ever hit my phone
& fuck your collab cause I work better alone
I suggest that the next time you fucking watch your tone
I ain’t giving up my sound for a couple plays
& sorry for the delays, I’m just trynna find my way
Cause yeah that shit pays but I rather have praise
Yeah you made it quick but you know I’m trynna stay
Fuck a mixtape I’m trynna make an instant classic
Sign me to Atlantic, have me crossing the Atlantic
I guess that’s hypocritical, I’ll sell it as dynamic
I’m trynna make a sound, both synthetic and organic
Fuck a demographic when my life is cinematic
I’m an addict afflicting damage ain’t no closer thing to perfect
Conflicted cause you clicked it now you feeling like you missed it
Cause I spit it and I mixed it and this song is just a snippet
Count the digits, count the minutes every single time I pivot
What flow do you want cause nothing is original
Stealing other’s lanes used to never be permissible
If you’re being critical then let me be reciprocal
You’re just an individual who’s always been invisible
You’ve never been formidable that shit is unequivocal
You’re trynna be better but I’ve always been the pinnacle
Y’all busy being pawns so I always stay withdrawn
Trynna make a great album you ain’t even know you want
Food to feed the soul but it’s year long Ramadan
Nobody gave a listen on the tracks that I be rapping on
Hope that they listen way before that my soul is gone
Till the day I walk out and they like “that’s Jon.”
