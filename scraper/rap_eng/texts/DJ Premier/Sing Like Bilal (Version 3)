[Intro: Sample Of Lil' Fame]
Sing Like Bilal!!!

[Joell Ortiz] (Sample Of Lil' Fame)
Uh! Uh! Y-Y, Y-Y-Y-YAOOOWWWWW!!!!
J-J-Joell Ortiz, yeah (Sing-Sing like Bilal!!!)
Oh! Aiyyo Flex I got the kite, I was tuned in saturday night
Heh heh! You hear these guys?! (Sing-Sing like Bilal!!!)

[Verse One]:
You remove the big label that be backin them (Uh)
The moistened nine, ice the fake platinum
And bring it back to rap I will flatten them
I'm the best across the board like Tat and 'em
New York, If you feelin like me then you tired
Of listenin to liars, wishin it was fire
But none of them is hot not the flicker of a lighter
I'm about to blow up in they face Richard Pryor
Your industry buzz ain't valid on the streets loser
We don't care about them mags and them weak rumors
Your secret wack parties with free hookah
Ev'rybody walkin 'round tryin to be cooler
Nah! See I be where they keep ruegers
You ain't got to be in beefs the police shoot ya
The ox will give ya a ill buck fifty
New rappers is cool but we still bump Biggie (Baby)
I walk and perfects with a ill one with me
Fitted to the side on my Brooklyn shit
No V.I.P. I ain't shook for shit
I'm at the bar like after push ups and dips
As for this mic they don't want nothin (Why?)
Cause I eat 'em for breakfast, oatmeal cornmuffins
Lil' insects y'all all buggin
Flex I got you, next time I'll call up and record somethin

[Hook: DJ Premier scratchin]
W-When you hear-W-W-When you hear-W-W-When you hear me rewind me
From the city where niggas known for puttin in work ("Xzibit")
I-I-I-I make 'em nervous, I do it on purpose ("LL Cool J")
W-When you hear-W-W-When you hear-W-W-When you hear me rewind me
From the city where niggas known for puttin in work ("Xzibit")
This here serious ("Erick Sermon")
Sing-Sing like Bilal!!! ("Lil Fame")

[Verse Two]:
Check, I see your mouth movin, but you ain't sayin nothin
Ya boy's speakers all heat like my neighbor's oven
If I'm ANYWHERE near a mic, then I'm claimin somethin
I can't resist "The Temptation", David Ruffin
Hah! Who feelin froggy? Hop, kiddo!
I see to it Miss Piggy is a chopped widow
Before I saw gwap from Joell features
I had the corner on lock, Darrelle Revis
It's so I treat rap like coke, bet it
You want lines, gimme mines, homie no credit
Y'all was hyped about homes like, no sweat it
He turned out to be a "Bus", Jerome Bettis
I'm on my chiro shit now, +back+ at it
Steady spittin that crack, I'm a crack addict
The belt sittin on my wiast, take a crack at it
My craft'll put you to sleep - hehe, Craftmatic

[Hook: DJ Premier scratchin]
W-When you hear-W-W-When you hear-W-W-When you hear me rewind me
From the city where niggas known for puttin in work ("Xzibit")
This here serious ("Erick Sermon")
Sing-Sing like Bilal!!! ("Lil Fame")

[Verse Three]:
Anyone who hear this and feel they rap heat (Whattup!)
I'm ridin 'round with the gloves in my backseat (Yeah)
Your manager is fiendin to prove a point
Since you ain't got the real belt we can square for your Gucci joint
And after I win it I give it back
But see I hope you gotta shake cause I gotta take your fitted hat
It got that N.Y. on it and I run that
P.R. ride with me since we can't bring Pun back
I'm king of the borough where original guns clap
Where that BIG nigga from the 'Stuy sold his joints at
Another 'Stuy nigga make you cough up your lungs at
Now a Cooper nigga flow dumb, no dunce cap (YAOOOWWWWW!!!!)
Ha! So easy up you little cocky schmuck
Your career's on thin ice you little hockey pucks
Mouth fire, everything I spit is Cajun
I'm tellin you I'm hot dog I just sit at Nathan's
