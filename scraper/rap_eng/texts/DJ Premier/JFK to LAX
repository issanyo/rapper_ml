[verse: Napoleon Da Legend]
This ain’t premeditated I won’t edit what I say
Rappers prostituting my bending over for whatever pays
Self-educate, made myself a heavy weight
Self-made that’s as American as a Chevrolet
Make it resonate from Beverly Hills to section 8
On my way to JFK forgot where I was yesterday
Time zones and jet lag cash checks and check bags
Backed up 80 messages I gotta check back
So be patient on the text back "x" that
On my way to LAX where my ex at
Don’t trespass the cultures precious we protect that
Breakfast in the back eating fruits eggs flapjacks
Let the sun hit my face and let my battery charge
Feeling like I beat a battery charge
Feeling marvelous
Promoters flew me up, homies come to scoop me up
Without a worry in the world we just doing us

[Hook:Guru]
They wanna lock us all up, and throw away the key
Don't wanna see us come up, don't wanna see us making G's
Long as we know this is the key to our destruction
Let's make moves no discussion

[verse: Napoleon Da Legend]
For whatever reason I became a rebel genius
Chilling backstage with several divas
Ya numbers ain’t looking right, I can tell you cheating
Relax... I’ll let you live... I can keep a secret
My pet peeve is really those who waste time
And you can never get it back that’s why I claim mine
I'm a mix between jay Z and Dame’s mind
So confident I’m bout to give away my 8 lives
Great minds think alike that’s why we disagree mostly
Last month was going on Hennessy and no sleep
Caffeine adrenaline addict it’s like a passion
And things going better than I can ever imagine
Life is good when you take charge
A wise man told me quit if u can’t convince em after 8 bars
Flight control tower they keep me on they radar
JFK 2 LAX we do it like it ain't far
