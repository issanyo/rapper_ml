[Intro]
One two
Yeah
Uh huh
One two, one two
Get the levels right, baby
Yeah
When I strike, you motherfuckers better be out
I'm not playing around man, I never did anyway
I ain't gonna start now
You know what I'm saying
Aha

[Scratches by DJ Premier]
"I keep you on the run"

[Verse 1]
One for the money, two for the show
The industry is scared 'cause I go toe to toe
Door to door, my flow still break locks
Invite your girls over 'cause I still serve cock
I splash some and broke the rest
Knee deep in the game, so I spit my best
Still rocking it, though, so I'm feeling blessed
Live the motto, serve and protect
I need more money than a royalty check
So I can keep the condo and the gated complex
I once lived life low on the hard
Now I live in the spot where they clean up after dogs
Still go to clubs where the floor is sticky
And all my dudes still smoke sticky
And them haters, well, they still want to get me
But don't get it fooled, I'll still beat up a fool
And all these cheap verses got to stop
Niggas is customers, make them get up off that guap
And when I strike, you may not like
So prepare your squad for a fight
When I strike

[Hook]
When I strike, you better be ready
"Are we ready"
When I strike, you better be ready
"I keep you on the run"
When I strike, you better be ready
"Are we ready"
When I strike, you better be ready
Ready

[Verse 2]
I split dudes who reach for my food
'Cause everyday, I can't be in a good mood
I be in the Caymans watching the catwalk
Then after the show, I'm spitting the don talk
It don't matter if she's tall, heavy, or thin
We still gonna get it in
I still play to win, I still pray to wash my sins
But they still keep pulling me in
Owe me money? I still break legs at the shins
Still slapping off them silly grins
I still fill up the stash sheet, clap at your cold feet
Give your girl full skeet while you're holding short meat
Want to throw shots? Say when
And get tossed of the roof and scraped off the pavement
And when I strike, you may not like
So get your squad ready and prepare for a fight
When I strike

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
My diamond in the rough is now flawless
She done came through with the flying colors
She's my main girl, she's the right girl
In this hip-hop world, she's my hype girl
She don't understand it, the ins and outs
But that's not what wifey is all about
She shows support for the things I do
I be the one, and she's a lot more than the two
But niggas still want to take what she got
So I hit them with the hot Glock, cook them like a Crock Pot
Hit them in the snot spot, watch the bullshit stop
I change things I do not like
So when I step left, you better step right
And get your squad ready and prepare for a fight
When I strike

[Hook]
