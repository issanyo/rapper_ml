[Intro]
Yeah, off the dome, I'm extreme
I don't do this normally, I'm to much of a king
With this rap shit, let's just go, yo

[Verse]
Rappers will never repent, after there ending
Their easily given, trick some bitches
Won't be submissive to them
If they scratching me, with they lee nails colored pink
And as soon I'm thinking, I'm always have some type
Of recognition to the visions, ya bitches
I'm flipping chicken, my niggas with clips longer than snippets
Making decisions, collide the business
What's written is vicious, I don't need permission
To set graves on instrumentals and RIP it
With thoughts imprisoned
Listening to my Illmatic, ill with the ambition
Yo, I remember I met John, he told me
That there's no pot to piss in, when you feel
Like your whole world gone, and life's a song
That's not meant for the singing, diamonds in the dirt
I ain't blinging, I'm just pinning, spinning my time
Spitting, for at least a couple dollars or some pennies
Still sicker than a whole clinic, I'm in it, like old winnings
I met a homeless nigga, near the road of the interstate
Saying he needs some bread, I gave him 10
To get on, and not sleep at the bridge under the 77
And now later that nigga gonna thank me then
I think that be real, none of these niggas
Will survive in a field of life's wheel
You rats squeal, the pigs don't scare me
Neither do ya'll punk niggas, what I tote is real
Have a mind, that's too divine to mess up
Niggas will have they opinions, no need to fess up
But if a nigga push me, he gonna kicked back
I'm making my mix, match, popping
More than a fucking soda patch
Shit, at that, if niggas want war, they gonna have to pick up
Something other than they guns, you can make fun
But I'm still the best to ever do this son, full energy
Tank shots, that's in epitome, and see
I don't give a fuck of what you think of me
The inner me, telling don't knock out this nigga
But my mind, is telling me, if you don't, he'll beat you
Within a second, my thoughts resign
I won't back from a challenge, fuck with the most intricate
And I'll have to recruit to some violence
Meditate with the silence, my mind fly like a pilot
Sleep the cousin of death, I think he full of knowledge
I have a father of time, and the mother of Earth
This the rebirth of the curse, I'm bout to show what's worse, gone!
