[Verse 1]
Excuse me, you headin'my way?
Tryin'to find something to brighten up my day
Maybe I could talk to you or you could talk to me
Your eyes seem to call out for some comfort
Is it the everyday racism
Or a pain from deep within
I may not understand now but then again
You could talk to me or we could just sit here and daydream

[Chorus]
Say, you headin'my way
Two lonely hearts on the subway
Singin'the blues on the subway train

[Verse 2]
Black black yes it's hard and that's a fact
But I can rise above
When I have love
Here comes the train
Please don't turn and walk away – stay
We could read some Ntozake Shange
And I loose myself in the book
I escape to my heavenly tomb
Or we could read The Voice
It's your choice
I just want to get to know you

[Breakdown]
Say, you headin'my way
Say, you headin'my way

[Verse 3]
Your lovely black face
Accompanied by some strictly roots
As we venture – it's just nice to be near you
