[Hook: Omar]
It's never too late to do what you want
Things can go right, you've got to be strong
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse: 50 Styles: The Unknown Soldier AKA Uptown]
Awww take a look
Now you want to go write a book
And try to break out with all the clout that you took
No doubt you're trying to play me out like a crook
Got me so vexed you made a nigga want to hook
Hook blaow!
You tricked me and you don't know how
I knew the [?] Mac-10 was gonna wil'
It's my turn to burn with the mic as a weapon
I yearn to learn so I keep steppin'

[Hook]
