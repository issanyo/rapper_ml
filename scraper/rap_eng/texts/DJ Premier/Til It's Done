[Intro: Samples]
"Let me break it down for you"

[Hook: Anderson .Paak]
And isn't it amazing, took a little patience
Look at all the faces I shocked
Runnin' on the payment, workin' like the grave shift
Tryna make my way in this bitch
What I'm gon' do when the youth is gone?
What I'm gon' leave for my son?
Every single day I'm running on the payment
Til it's done

[Pre-Hook: Anderson .Paak]
Oh how they love me when the game is strong
Oh how they love me when the money's way long
Oh now they wonder if the hype is real
Oh now you want me when I'm off the radar

[Hook: Anderson .Paak]
And isn't it amazing, took a little patience
Look at all the faces I shocked
Runnin' on the payment, workin' like the grave shift
Tryna make my way in this bitch
What I'm gon' do when the youth is gone?
What I'm gon' leave for my son?
Every single day I'm running on the payment
Til it's done

[Verse 1: Anderson .Paak]
Look how they looking, look like they love me
They wanna take a picture, run kisses, now they wanna hug me
I remember when bitches didn't want my company
I remember rollin' up swishers with nothin' but bits of struggle tree
And it wasn't you, wasn't none of you around me
Everybody wanna count you out when you down for the counting
Even when I didn't have much, I had sense enough
To let the engine run and such the finish come, but we ain't done

[Bridge: Anderson .Paak]
I was looking at the stars, starry eyes
I was tryna keep the lights on, in the darkest times

[Verse 2: Anderson .Paak]
Yeah, and look at all the bullshit I've been through
Now they wanna ask me how you do it
Everybody want that overnight
Don't nobody want that sacrifice
Don't nobody wanna work that overtime
My compensation overdue
My confirmation came from self
I never wait on you

[Pre-Hook: Anderson .Paak]
Oh how they love me when the game is strong
Oh how they love me when the money's way long
Oh now they wonder if the hype is real
Oh now you want me when I'm off the radar

[Hook: Anderson .Paak]
And isn't it amazing, took a little patience
Look at all the faces I shocked
Runnin' on the payment, workin' like the grave shift
Tryna make my way in this bitch
What I'm gon' do when the youth is gone?
What I'm gon' leave for my son?
Every single day I'm running on the payment
Til it's done
