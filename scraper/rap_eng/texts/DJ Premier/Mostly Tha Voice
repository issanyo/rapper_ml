It’s mostly the voice
That’s gets you up
It’s mostly the voice that’s makes you buck
A lot of rappers be buzzing and some got skills
But if your voice ain’t dope then you need to chill

These rapper wanna rhyme all fast
Trying to hide the fact they rhymes is trash
A few comments and get all gassed
But most Internet fools don’t know jack about rap
On stage with ya vocals on the track
Not to mention that ya voice is ass
I rather hear wind coming out a horse’s ass
Trying to be intricate the way you forcing is sad
My R.A.P. M. E. S. S. I. A. H
They waiting on me like the Latter Day Saints
I’m just that dude and they mad that they ain’t
I tell em that

It’s mostly the voice that’s makes you buck

Soon as I enter the scene they had to recognize
Record wise but to me it was just exercise
Tap dancing on high hats with words
This is high class pulling chicks with fly hats and furs
And yes my names heard across the land
From U.K., Germany, down to Japan
They pay me grands just to rap and stand
But they don’t understand and I tell em that

Y’all dudes doing too much
Flashing ya cash
Paying for strippers that be shaking they ass
Looking for waves that you can catch and surf
Study who’s popping so you copy and match they work
I just follow groove like Nice and Smooth
When it comes to these bars I don’t got much to prove
Look at my shoes a rock sneakers and tracksuits
And I still want the props like the song from Black Moon
Peace to Evil Dee, peace to Baz, peace Prime time
Eclipse and DJ Fab
I run 100 dash without a break a sweat
And do a tour around the world without a taking a jet
They be asking how’s that even possible yo
You hard headed pay attention, I tell you that
