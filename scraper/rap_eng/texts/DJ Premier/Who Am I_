Blasting off in the car
Thinking bout my dad drawing a loan and dropping the car
Keeping it in the driveway parked
Taking the license plates and tossing them like a frisbee
Keeping my foot on the gas praying not one of these cars miss me
Maybe an 18-wheeler just might hit me
Part of my mom lung just dropped
Last year my brother got locked
This year my brother playing his luck
I just want to get shot in the torso and let the bullet get stuck
No more selling, no more profits
Contemplating suicide screaming fuck all the prophets
Feeling down and out on my luck
Being an asshole to everybody and I don't give a fuck
My parents just might die, my thoughts turning dry
Still in this speeding car cruising through southside
Staring at the ground picturing my brains spilled on the pavement outside
Niggas done made me cry, said they wish I'd just die
Done fucked with the slyest of the sly
But none of these things compared to the feeling of having my vision die
Constantly Asking the question, who the fuck am I?
