[Intro]
Like a sound you hear that lingers in your ear
But you can't forget from sundown sunset, now
It's all in the air, you hear it everywhere
No matter what you do, it's gonna forever hold on you
California

[Verse 1]
Floor me out with the sun in your mouth, like you always do
I can't go on like this, like you want me to (everlasting peace)

[Chorus]
Baby, I will fall back on you
Like you want me to, like you want me to
Baby, I will fall back on you
Like you know me to, like you know me to

[Verse 2]
Ooh, comes love, as your eyes move slowly
You're all around me now (everlasting peace)
[?] while your hands move on me
You doubt me now (everlasting peace)

[Chorus]
Baby, I will fall back on you
Like you know me to, like you know me to
Baby, I will fall back on you
Like you want me to, like you want me to

[Bridge]
And the knife falls down
And you need me around
Am I always down? (everlasting peace)
When a knife falls out
And you want me around
Am I always down?
Am I always down?

[Chorus]
Baby, I will fall back on you
Like you want me to, like you want me to
Baby, I will fall back on you
Like you know me to, like you know me to

[Verse 3]
Cut me down with the blade out your tongue
Like you know me now (everlasting peace)
I can't grow,when you keep me so small
Yeah, I found you out (everlasting peace)

[Outro]
Like a sound you hear that lingers in your ear
But you can't forget from sundown sunset, now
It's all in the air, you hear it everywhere
No matter what you do, it's gonna forever hold on you
California
