Thinking school shooting is cool
It's as normal as hitting the juul in the school bathroom
Until your brain begins to fathom
Wishing you were danny phantom
Introverted, extra extra perverted
Not talking about adam or fade, jewel or spade
Gaining some hate
Dragging all your weight
Jump past the gate
Not talking about your fate

Call it a rap or show me a free
Criticisms somethin' I no longer need
Ya see, I don't accept it
To move as I am directed
I'm not the type to think that it's cool to get arrested
If u know me I'm low key, I'm known to be difficult
Unable to compete wit the king of satirical
Your right to be cynical when the fight is unwinnable
Your raps lack any impact that is visible
If I seem critical just know it's for the best
Listening to phony mcs get me depressed

Chorus:
Knowing this is a freestyle
Knowing you are an imbecile
Knowing this is a freestyle
Knowing you are - you are - you are - an imbecile

Noone fooled from the deceiving ways of ur bait
You better learn how to wait before you learn
Indefinete traits
You've got to await the state of yourself
I am going to set the record straight
Knowing you cannot relate
Gotta clean my great big over the gate plate
Wishing you can play like a playmate
Mutating before you can restate
Reflate, postdate, predate, prostate
The roommates rotated weight is twisted
Can you please, please translate
Bender fendered the tailgate

Chorus:
Knowing this is a freestyle
Knowing you are an imbecile
Knowing this is a freestyle
Knowing you are - you are - you are - an imbecile
