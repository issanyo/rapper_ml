[Intro: DJ Premiere]
Go up, go up
Go up, go up

[Verse 1: Miley Cyrus]
Feels like I just woke up
Like all this time I've been asleep
Even though it's not who I am
I'm not afraid of who I used to be

[Chorus: Miley Cyrus]
No one stays the same (oh, oh)
You know what goes up must come down (oh, oh)
Change is a thing you can count on (oh, oh)
I feel so much younger now (oh, oh)

[Verse 2: Miley Cyrus]]
Feels like I've been living in a dream
But never make it to the end
My eyes open when they feel the light
It's always right before I'm about to scream

[Chorus: Miley Cyrus]]
No one stays the same (oh, oh)
You know what goes up must come down (oh, oh)
Change is a thing you can count on (oh, oh)
I feel so much younger now (oh, oh)

[DJ Premiere]
Go up, go up
Go up

[Bridge: Miley Cyrus & DJ Premiere]
What goes up must come down (go up)
What goes up must come down (go up)
What goes up must come down
What goes up must come down (yeah)

[Chorus: Miley Cyrus]
No one stays the same (oh, oh)
You know what goes up must come down (oh, oh)
Change is a thing you can count on (oh, oh)
I feel so much younger now (oh, oh)
I feel so much younger now (yeah)
I feel so much younger now
