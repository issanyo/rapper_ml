[Intro: Royce da 5'9"]
Yo I like this one
Just let it go Preem
Give em a second to give us a lil courtesy, you know
You ready? (You ready?) Okay
Well hold these sunflower seeds, I'm going in

[Verse 1: Royce da 5'9"]
Guess who's bizack, the best two that's gon' ever do it
Don't need no Metro or Neptunes trizack
This is what you call alcoholic recordin', flawless guitar rifts
Now they ridin' with us for sure in the Audi or this
Ferrari, this is for Joe Montgomery and Johnny Morris
Now we 'bout to Power up the Ghost like Omari Hardwick
Time flies when you havin' a nice time
So when I drive I try to ride slower than Heinz pourin'
My mama told me to try to enjoy it
Take you a vitamin, boy, and stick to your diet and tour it (harder)
Keep risin' and soarin', (harder) don't put your mind on the evil
Keep your eye on the people who would kill just to be by you
And beware of those who appear to be dyin' to meet you
Let your therapy be The Bible and let yourself just be legendary
And just continue to keep on helpin' the less fortunate
Not for no fuckin' credit in public but for the blessings above
Most important lesson I learned was just to love (true)
Most of my aggression was extra liquor and just the drugs (true)
Wherever I go, whoever I'm with, I'm met with hugs (true)
While all you rappers gettin' extorted, in debt with thugs

[Chorus: Royce da 5'9"]
I'm ridin' around in a Maserati 'bout to go to McDonald's
Eatin' sunflower seeds (laid back)
But I still'll spit the shell out the window
Still'll spit the shell out the window (whattup doe)
Now that I'm livin' well all I remember is
All I could afford was sunflower seeds (laid back)
But I still'll spit the shell out the window
Still'll spit the shell out the window

[Verse 2: Royce da 5'9"]
I will spit these out a Gallardo
Then peel off laughin' like Ricky Ricardo
Go to your lady home and spit a whole bag of sunflower seeds out on her marble
Floor, oh no I didn't
I killed the fish and put wings on the doggie
For treatin' me like I don't, don't know fly bitches
Nickel, I'm back in the Preem of things
Two jackets, this one is dapper, that one is Steve McQueen
I flip on a rapper
Quick as Christopher could finish up a track on a beat machine
I pull out a full metal jacket
Show you exactly what goin' platinum with features mean
I am the absolute shit, I actually speak latrine, PRhyme 2
All day you hear UZI choppers and nines too
All day you niggas eat sushi, sausage, and fondue
The drum dilla like Ma Duke, the Hummer red
And it come on top of giant-sized shoes like clown suits
The rifle rightfully mine too
It might just heat up from the field in the clutch
Like when Mike and LeBron shoot

[Chorus: Royce da 5'9"]
Ridin' around in a Maserati 'bout to go to McDonald's
Eatin' sunflower seeds (laid back)
But I still'll spit the shell out the window
Still'll spit the shell out the window
Now that I'm livin' well all I remember is
All I could afford was sunflower seeds (laid back)
But I still'll spit the shell out the window
Still'll spit the shell out the window

[Outro: Novel & Royce da 5'9"]
And I, I grew up in the streets
One man (one man), one heart (one heart), one love (one love)
Livin' in the ghetto you get one chance (you get one chance)
You know I keep a piece and my sunflower seeds in the other hand
And Po-Po out here shootin' niggas, yeah they tryna kill the brother man
And I, I grew up in the streets
One man (one man), one heart (one heart), one love (one love)
Livin' in the ghetto you get one chance
You know I keep a piece and my sunflower seeds in the other hand
