(Intro: Melachi The Nutcracker)
Yo! This is the mighty Nutcracker, no doubt
Check it out
It is ok that we make mistakes
No one on this level is perfect
It is ok to cry and make mistakes
That is part of bein of a human being
We must sacrifice for the best and the best is yet to come
So everyone who doubt in thee
I'm just sayin: fuck you!

(Interlude Cuts):
Our society is fucked up
They're fuckin our brothas
This is-s-s, this is white society
They've, problem, us, uh
This shit ain't no god damn accident
This shit wears niggas out too hard
This shit was created for us
This shit was created to make niggas tweak
It must be something in the... the nigga blood or something
This shit... these ni-ni-niggas, ni-ni-niggas

(Verse 1: Absaloot)

Aiyyo the crooks be crooks and the sunz be sons
May the biggest man be the man with the biggest guns
To elevate my mindstate, and take the weight
Cock back two gats, it's power moves to make
I sacrifice the lifestyle, that I'm livin
For all the real shit and drama that been givin
For years, I never faked jax with fear
Step to my missions, man to man, act my own age
One for one, go for yours, blow for blow
All out schemes to see the big doe
Yo, I sacrifice my lifestyle, man
Word up, yo, uh..

(Verse 2: Melachi The Nutcracker)

Here's a lesson from God, show 'em how we roll hard
This life I must sacrifice with the death squad
It's all about  yo gettin mines no fuckin' doubt
And all y'all fake fuckin niggas need to break out
Word up, yo, I kill you in a battle
Deadly like a rattlesnake
But I don't rattle
Here's a saddle for the ride of ya life
And if you don't know me, I think you better think twice
You better step or check for someone else
When you step in my trap, you wreck yourself
Here's the wealth, good health and the money
You funny, like that fuckin dummy Bugs Bunny
Feel my wrath, here's my ass in the cold draft
Cause I love to blast, and I love to crash
Everyday we do it around my way
Have no time to play, I just fade away...
I sacrifice my lifestyle

(Interlude Cuts:
Hey, you can't change anything
Just goin' on, you know what...
Hope y'all... don't let TV take over your minds
Le-learn and think for yourself)

(Verse 3: Absaloot)

Ain't nothing sweet, you and death'll meet
Fuckin with the streets, shit's real
We know the deal so we pack steel
We be the individuals livin relentless
Packin automatic weapons and bullet proof vests
Me and my crew got to live & prove
Livin Proof- so I choose not to fake moves
I make moves and break rules if I have to
No dough, so I got the gat pointed at you
By any means I'm out for cream
And willin to do sticks, catch vicks
Because I'm on some trife shit
Yo, I sacrifice my lifestyle man, wordup

(Outro: Absaloot)

The absolute Nutcracker
The boogie-woogie body snatchas
Yea, to my nigga Deputy
Getting that paper, know what I'm sayin?
My nigga Headquarters
Smily, the Ghetto Child
Brainsick Mob, A Mob, yo, yeah, uh
