[Verse 1: Jeru the Damaja]
Electromagnetic beam, I get charged
Rhymes I run right through 'em like a big box of Trojan large
MCs tried to hang but it's a Brooklyn thing
Poison slang, poison fang
Poison pen let me begin
Tryin' to rhyme up in my cipher is gamblin'
Freestylin' me G, I be buckwildin'
You can't even challenge a nigga in my position
Technician, renditions more freaky than Rick James
Fly like airplanes through all it remain the same
My cuts like Freddy Krueger, don't need a German Luger
But shoot more shit than Sturm-Ruger
Dirty rottens comin' through punks cling to their guns
Don't start none, it won't be none
'Cause uhh... fuck around and it'll be tragic

[Hook]
And I could rock a rhyme with just statik
And I could rock a rhyme with just statik
And I could rock a rhyme with just statik

[Verse 2: Jeru the Damaja]
Devastating, I gotcha heart pulsating
Kool-Aid, you need aid, ejaculating
Rhymes like semen, MCs is scheming
Tryna bag me baby black you must be beemin'
Fiendin', I don't know who gassed ya head up
I'm straight up, for less niggas have got wet up
I'm on a mission, scrambling my enemies transmission
And when he least expect it, run up in his HQ
High IQ, every verse is EQed
Slither like a snake, still you can't elude
The neba, but not caneza
It's the toucha, no gun or God can protect ya
Neither the scripture, choke like a boa constrictor
This is my house and I'll evict ya
Big respect is automatic - black

[Hook]
And I could rock a rhyme with just statik
And I could rock a rhyme with just statik
And I could rock a rhyme with just statik
And I could rock a rhyme with just statik
And I could rock a rhyme with just statik

[Verse 3: Jeru the Damaja]
I'll snatch up your girlfriend, her friend and their friends
I got the game and fame, she got the condoms
She's a victim, you shouldn't have that mouth dirty rotten
For the longest we knew you were plottin'
On the downfall, who stands tall, lick the balls
I'm not like that, so I smash out pussy walls
On the low, oh no, on the high
I get high, praise to the most high
Try to battle me, step up and die
Like the arc of the covenant I electrify
Petrify, intelligence I glorify
So devils are horrified
Sprayin' like pesticide, come commit suicide
Step into my realm and be fried
By the statik
