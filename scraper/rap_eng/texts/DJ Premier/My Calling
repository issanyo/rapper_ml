[Intro]
Ready?
Yeah

[Verse 1]
I was told by God to bar rap
I thought he meant go to bars, buy bottles and all that
As far back as I care to remember, I been very stupendous
Birds flockin', coppin' furs, watches, canaries, and pedants
I reinvented after I quit and then buried the image
Uncle Joe told me, "Take care of your business"
Hoes know me, I'm the only nigga famous in the D you still'll see
On the block ballin', answerin' my callin'

[Chorus]
So you know my bitches wide-bodied
My whip is wide bodied
Religion, god body, uh
I walk up in here like
This is my party
Gettin' these hoes' numbers like
This is my calling, uh, my calling, uh

[Verse 2]
Either they're criticizin' the music, comparin' numbers
Or makin' America great again, wearin' rompers
I ran bundles for that clown, I can't mumble
Or stand stumble, I sat down, I stand humble

[Bridge]
PRhyme
Take the boxing gloves off
Hand 'em to the gods
We do it for the music
'Cause I rise to the top, then I lay it down flat
PRhyme
Take the boxing gloves off
Hand 'em to the gods
We do it for the music
'Cause I rise to the top, then I lay it down flat

[Verse 3]
I'm what you call a boss, I buy the booth then do the toast
I don't floss though, I inspire the youth to do the most
Lemon pepper wings from Hooters flow, the coolest though
I swing on you quick if you misconstrue us 'cause you the hoe
I come from the school of hard knocks, only the student rose
Sippin' from a chalice that's Michigan College, blue and gold
Feel like I belong here, though I'm labeled as garbage
A born-player which may be my callin'
Maybe I was made for trickin' dollars and misbehavin' in Starlit's
Breakin' a misses heart with her sister and maid of honor
She's conflicted 'cause she watches me go out in the streets and lose the very same respect she witnessed me make and honor
And I got all this stuff, but I'm stuck being alcoholic, bruh
Therefore I'm all mixed up, like Aunt Jemima
My pants cost a thousand
They made by designers with names
I done forgot 'cause I can not pronounce them

[Chorus]
So you know my bitches wide-bodied
My whip is wide bodied
Religion, god body, uh
I walk up in here like
This is my party
Calling my sidechick up like
This is my calling, uh, my calling, uh
