[Verse 1: Lil Dap]
Yo, I'll be a black panther all in your dreams
Up Against The Wall, they jailed me 'cause you can't seek peace
And you ain't supposed to die a natural death, that's that
Got to work hard for mines, struggles on the line
Watchin' all these niggas in the street for a while
Break it down more than motherfuckin' dirt poor style
I keep it real, you keep it to yourself and don't say jack
Every time I turn around and you're all on my back
For what? I don't know, these devils won't leave me alone
I've been here for 20 years and here to stand my ground
And these devils gettin' open but they can't get down
Chantin' lyrics through the city like a newborn seed
These types of lyric that's mine that's organized with the time
I'm on the road checkin' my B.I., ideas start to come
But the season of success, it got them all fucked up
What you want right now you many see mad later
Yo, my word is divine, you got to seek and find
A new place to rest my mind, no more petty crimes
Yo, I'm up against the wall

[Verse 2: Melachi the Nutcracker]
Yo the world is falling
Death is calling
I don't know, MC's be brawling
On the mic, when I get hype
Whenever you want yo whatever you like
Bite on my style, I like that
Yo, here's your feedback, with one smack
Yeah, you know what I'm saying?
No time to be playing 'cause these niggas be delaying
Word, yo, when I get busy
Here and over there to New York City
One for one, one for all
I'm on the wall, my back is on the wall

[Scratched Hook 2X]
"Such a pity, that livin' in the city is like livin' in the times of Frank Nitti"
"Walkin' the tunnels of hell, the next level"
"It's the end of the time, so I gotsta gets mine"

[Verse 3: Melachi the Nutcracker]
Yo, it's a wonderful world, a world of wonder
I thunder and thunder, I won't go under
Won't get in a trap, I'm past all that
You stupid muthafucka, my rhyme is phat
Phat as can be on the M-I-C
In the place to be, if you can't see
You don't know then go ask your momma
Eatin' MCs live like Jeffery Dahmer
One of one, one for all
I'm on the wall, I'm on the wall

[Verse 4: Lil Dap]
As for the seeds in the streets rockin' rugged and hard
Innocent bystanders gettin' popped and scarred
Niggas not keeping it real and they will get barred
5-O on my back thinkin' that they're the God
Brothers keep on dividing and we won't get far
The devil's on some slick shit, ready to hose us down
But I maintain my focus and just hold the fort down
You all know a situation funny thing like this
A suspicious yellow cab riding through the East
A stereotype brother make the undercovers wonder
Got lawyers all in the East ready to shine my light
Nutcracker get 'em open 'fore he sparks the night
For my brothers and my sisters in the streets doing their thing
My back's against the wall, I can't do a damn thing
Yo, I'm up against the wall

[Scratched Hook 4X]
"Such a pity, that livin' in the city is like livin' in the times of Frank Nitti"
"Walkin' the tunnels of hell, the next level"
