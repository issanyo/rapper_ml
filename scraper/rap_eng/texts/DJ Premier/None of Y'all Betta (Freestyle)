(Freestyle)
I wanna bleed, sweat & cry over Premier
I'm tryna follow the same path Slaine, Budden, Tech & Em career
On your death bed, you can read my page, my pen you'll hear
I'm fuckin' crawlin' under your skin with fear
Say my name seven times, watch my sins appear
On your knees say your prayers
Can't get ridda of me like Conjuring, I stay under the stairs
Deaths not all black & white like Insidious with grey stares
Speaking in fuckin' tongues, you'll have nightdreams & daymares
Pull it backwards play my dares
With my hands I turn my rhyme book pages idle
Give you 39 lashes with every page from the bible
It gets to the point your thoughts get to the centre stage of bein' suicidal
My conditions critical in this fuckin' cage I'm vital
