What, boy?
Let's have some motherfuckin' fun
Yeah, ayee, yeah

[Verse]
Folarin like, women level-headed
And more aggressive
That demoralize any moralless
Man or woman and
More or less any man or woman that go against me
Better know the lord, ignore it, keep it F450
Truckin'
Fuck a 450, we 730
It's December now
When they simmer down we start burnin' 'em
It's embarrassing
There's literally no comparison
That's like comparing Yogi Berra and Yogi Ferrell
I'm the coldest poet, they never show it
I show up like the fuckin' bear from Revenant
Barely niggas is Yogi Bear in here
Mo', this is a picnic walk
I sip gin, tonic in booth then I big shit talk
I'm cool, clam, collected 'less I get pissed off
Then everybody get it like a pitch in kickball
Pimp hard, pimp hard, but think two times harder
Mulsanne parked
I bet the Pumas Usain Bolt to us
Woo! That's a fast ass pussy cat
Ralph really rappin' like he's really, really in his bag yeah
Folarin like, a lot of artist father I
Think a lot of y'all been multiplying the prototype
Notice I
Don't hang with niggas much in this industry
Been this way, niggas be hating wasting my energy
Then they say
Maybe Folarin is just a mental case
It's not the case
I just confide in cases of Hennessy
L.A. Fitness with Philip, yeah I'm gettin' a little bigger
Baby mama don't notice, all my bitches can dig it
'Bout to hit the casino, Steve O bring all the women
And if we hit the digits, the only way that we're trickin'
Rose gold the pinky
Flows gold, the singles
Is all gold and platinum, I'm so focused really
Whole goal was really
To promote the city
Some niggas off that boat like they got motion sickness
Lord forgive me, you know that I'm flawed
But been on my job
Way more, 'cause I had a daughter
I dogged bitches before
Now talk sense into bitches
And not to give you my business
But they ain't bitches no more
Naw, nah, fuck it let's keep this shit goin'
I see niggas talkin',  could chalk it, grown people ignore it
But keep with the bluffin'
You see I be with people that love that shit
Love to see you public performin', we will applaud
Now you Weekend at Bernie-lookin'
Mama purchasing urns for you, confirming you finished
I done murked you niggas
Was the first one, this versatile
Hurts me to hurt ya
It burns, yeah it burns because I birthed you nigga
Yeah, of course you niggas forgot
But every time I drop a single niggas hittin' me up
Tellin' me to give 'em a jump
Never think they'll ever pull up
Literally I live in Maryland, Beverly Hills and the charts
Yup, and with the pen it's like I'm like Kemba with ball
I'm Kyrie, Jamal
Crawford, guard me and you fall
Foreign features from South Korea
BTS be the shit, we about to see it
I am not North or South, I am just DMV
I'm a G, well-achieved, well-received
I'm a seasoned nigga
Yeah, boy I'm the cleanest nigga
Got soul, got style, rap genius nigga
I will not back down when you see a nigga
My whip black, light brown, Pam Gina nigga
Yeah, Folarin like
Women like Miss Erykah
Badu, see you next lifetime, I marry ya
Playin' though nigga this gospel on my tonsils
Got the world on my hand like Kwame on Captain Planet do
I'm just a rhymer a lot of y'all just be sleepin' on
They stay at mama's house and get their Cheetos and cheap reefer on
They stay on social media
Being somebody doper than the person they are in person
Of course nobody meetin' them
Folarin like, none of these niggas
Shine coming, man I'm tired of everyone of these niggas
Fuck 'em
