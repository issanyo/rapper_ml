Yeah

Topshelf

Ent Lifestyle

Santa Barbara California's where I'm out

Enyukay yeah I got it in da smash
And that's too bad you
Sweatpants straight hangin' off my ass
So forget about the tailored suits

Do me favor
Life is stable
While I savor
Got the world my both hands
Hot potato
Up top when I glide across land like I'm able
If Enyukay's a lost man God can save him
Its like I'm steppin' from the streets
Its my ass's fault
Layin' down the concrete
This a small feat but
Stay strapped in my car seat
Enyukay's goin' straight to the top where stars meet boy
I see positive power
Teens nowadays they be thinkin' all sour
If its just a phase
Grab a towel and take a shower
If you tryna blaze then we rollin' up a tower
Waitin' for the days man you thinkin' like coward
California days
Im just thinkin' like a cow would
Enyukay Topshelf rep it like child would
Seems like the days just passin' like the hours

Enyukay yeah I got it in tha smash
And thats too bad you
Dejavu like I've lived a lost past
So I could uncover the strains of truth

Enyukay cover chronic up with hash
Like its fuckin' no thing to do
At nights when I'm thinkin' all nasty
I got dreams of bein' in you

Enyukay muthafucka
