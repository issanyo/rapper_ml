[Scratching]:
"You are now rappin' with the"
"NYG'z"
"Are you ready?"
"I said, are you ready?"
"You are now rappin' with the"
"NYG'z"
"Are you ready?"
"I said, are you ready?"

[Verse One] [Panch]:
I've been Shady since Dub C, my Curb Servin'
Had me rhymin' big guns and car swervin'
Nigga, ask Big Monster from any hood
He gonna tell you, "Oh yeah, cuz is in good."
Not the first or the last, I'm just one of many
1-83rd niggas that gets busy
The other half of Shiggy
Votes is in, we tallied 'em up
Yo the G's is in this bitch, I done rallied them up
Now take a look in my eyes, see I'm down to dance
Blow hell out your pants when you're fuckin' with Panch
Make your son a bastard, wife a widow
I'm the reason old ladies don't come to the window
The reason why the ambulance ain't come to get ya
Bring that nigga to the corner we know Panch gon' hit ya
What up Roulette, my love one, I ain't forget ya
You got bulletproof love, you know the Giantz is witcha

[Scratching]:
"You are now rappin' with the"
"NYG'z"
"Are you ready?"
"I said, are you ready?"
"You are now rappin' with the"
"NYG'z"
"Are you ready?"
"I said, are you ready?"

[Verse Two] [Shiggy Sha]:
Listen
It's not a game, from the streets we came
And why all this rain, wash away the blood stains
Haunted by my memories, can't shake my dirt
But these young boys will G me cause I put in work
Shiggy
Ask about me, my resume's official
Real nigga
That's why Terror, Spook, L, we miss ya
We shed tears, they up there where it's clear
I'm down here in the confusion gettin' it in with Premier
Y'all used to us yet?
I know we growin' on ya niggas
All year round we've been flowin' on y'all niggas
Keep showin' all y'all niggas
The movement's in place
I catch a flashback, I'm smackin' dudes in they face
But wait
Listen to the tale of the tape
I'm straight, with three and a half years on my waist
Hit the breaks (the breaks?)
Yeah, the speed it could be deadly
Y'all hope I'm just rappin'
I hope y'all niggas ready

[Scratching]:
"You are now rappin' with the"
"NYG'z"
"Are you ready?"
"I said, are you ready?"
"You are now rappin' with the"
"NYG'z"
"Are you ready?"
"I said, are you ready?"

[Verse Three] [Shiggy Sha]:
One more gunshot back in the speaker
Get my point across help you blow like some reefer
Y'all niggas ready, got some shit I could teach ya
Like how to slide a diva and treat her like you don't need her
How to turn a hooptie to trucks and two seaters
Hustle gettin' bigger the figures and new sneakers
Been there and done that, show you, new features
Enjoy life and kick back with your feet up

[Panch]:
A great student, good teacher, I'm the shit really
A pro baller out the Bronx like Malik Sealy
Cramps over, plus she's bleeding I should stop it
Your period is over, this G shit we poppin'
This nigga Preme hit us off with some shit and we used it
Cause industry niggas don't recognize street music
It's the twins in New York reminiscent of the dealers
We rappin' to make a killin'
These niggas will have to kill us

[Scratching]:
"You are now rappin' with the"
"NYG'z"
"Are you ready?"
"I said, are you ready?"
"You are now rappin' with the"
"NYG'z"
"Are you ready?"
"I said, are you ready?"
