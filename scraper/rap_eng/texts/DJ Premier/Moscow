[Intro]
One, two, three, four

[Verse 1]
You won't need to worry, dear
'Cause how we [?] is how we feel inside
You'll be fine

[Chorus]
Take me
Take me
'Cause I wanna go wherever you go
Yeah, I wanna go wherever you go

[Verse 2]
Honey, you won't need to worry about a thing
'Cause now our time [?] bound by string
And I will lay you down in the tall grass
I will lay you down in the tall grass and, oh, your head

[Chorus]
Take me
Take me
'Cause I wanna go wherever you go
Yeah, I wanna go wherever you go
Take me
Take me
'Cause I wanna go wherever you go
Yeah, I wanna go wherever you go

[Outro]
Honey, you won't need to worry about a thing
Just lay your heavy head inside my hands
And I'll carry this old thing
And I will give you my good love
Darling, take my good love
And you'll be fine
