It's your boy Kanye Cheddar and I'm 'bout to sell (a million)
How much he charge for a track? About (a million)
How many niggas bit the soul? 'Bout (a million)
How many girls did I bone? About (a million)
I freestyle battle niggas for (a million)
Hey yo, y'all niggas don't want it
It's (a million) ways to die in this city
Hear me? (a million) Look, listen

A lot of speculation about the money I've made, me and Just Blaze
How are they fo'real, are them niggas really paid?
Rappers I've met or dealt with direct
Is it true he won't send a beat tape until he get a check?
What's the position you hold?
Can he really master depths who check by check
And 'H to the IZZO' only single that went gold?
If Roc-a-Fella should fold and you're left out in the cold
Is it back to ghost producin' for D.Dot on the low?
For the millionth time, askin' me
Questions like Toni Braxton, harassin' me
Like you don't care about my son's feelin's
Can I get a minute, you whack [bitch]
I ain't gotta jack shit
You heard 'Takeover', who runnin' this rap shit?
Eww fake tits
Shut up and make hits
Can't we all just get along, spread love like Take Six
What'chu doin' in L.A. with 50 Cent and Dr. Dre?
Didn't one them niggas have beef with Jay?
We doin' this shit for entertainment
Brings guns to the arraignment
While the judge in the chamber let one up out the chamber
BLAOW! {*laughs*}

I'm gonna sell (a million)
And after that I'ma buy a couple buildin's
My dog He Nice named his son (a million)
