[Napoleon Da Legend verse 1]
No way you’ll never make it come with that bullshit I’ll blaze ya
And show you the real meaning of entertainment
Peep the expression on his face when he figured out
His 30 seconds of fame about to wither out
Isiah Thomas, ya career go in and out
You gave a shot at the top that’s not the timid route
Done with ya P.R .run no more Sway
No Breakfast Club, Hot 97, no more play
It’s like they pushed an off switch you off lit
Dead you like concentration camps in Auschwitz the cold shoulder  Some call em vultures of the culture
Ya songs sweeter than a Ice cold soda
Following these trends them bitches is bi-polar
Quick to leave you for the next high roller
Then you’ll be mad as hell you signed a record deal
Cause you played yourself out to get the mass appeal

[Napoleon Da Legend verse 2]
Oh yea I’m nicer than all MCs when I breeze give me room please
I keep em captivated with the raps I’m making
Like the lives of the rich and famous
These rappers sounding like new borns fresh out of the incubator
One mic and a DJ on the 1's and 2's
Mike Jack... I couldn’t help it if I wanted to
I be stumbling on rhymes by accident
Without looking for the line that come after it
Can spot the type chasing after the spotlight
Every time I hear em talk I feel like something is not right
Like Cartwright shoot a 3 in the fourth
With 4 seconds to go and Michael Jordan on the court
At the finals on the seventh game, center stage
Got booed out of the arena
Now u wishing you had never played
I’m only spitting the real...
While they be losing the race trying to chase Mass Appeal
