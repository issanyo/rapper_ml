[Coal Cash]

This water ain't safe to drink when the levee break, convince the fishermen
We embed the lead so heavy, the flow's deadly like Flint Michigan
The dissident apparition switch to omniscient when I'm glitching in the omnipotent
With rhythm pitching to throw the sink of the kitchen
In, Logician of super wisdom in super condition cause of your superstition
Emissions back from the future, no supervision cause I'm in super position
No use for the wishing with precognition stomping the competition
Suspicion don't act surprised the wise apprised by Zecharia Sitchin
Tactitional drive of a black magician
Intuition inscribed the side of my ammunition with the names of victims of opposition that died
Applied a wide transmission for your suicide collision
As I split 'em to smithereens when the war screams of this Titan hit 'em
A demolition machine, its an obscene threat when I get relentless
You're defenseless verse this vet, bringing more death than the Tet Offensive
The letters invented a better incentive to the dead and demented
Template of how you write cuz that ain't right so you better repent it (re Pen It )

You flow malarkey with lethargy for show
I sniper siphon your soul, cyphers controlled by my oligarchy
A solar star fleet with anarchy in our heartbeat
Spark heat when I bust plus I'm smart enough to teach at Berkeley
The hierarchy ready to start me like a Maybach car key
Partially cuz I'm beast wrapped in a golden fleece stole from Harpies
Started an art league where marks leave that shit locked
My ships docked to greatness, it's all aces when the chips drop
Spit hot  and rip tracks, factors of who my family are
Hip-Hop is like a Kit Kat, rappers are filled with candy bars
Star chomper the art monster of spoken truth
Dudes like alright Wonka how much you want for that golden goose
The nuke launcher when I conjure up a doom cloud
A mushroom bloom, I'm a loon that was rubber room bound
Get hewn down by a platoon that'll ruin towns
We howl at the moon, spitting typhoons to consume ground
Drowning buffoons who assume, we couldn't be tuned out
A tomb to house goons hooking harpoons through their ruined crown

Uh..I blaze the path that the masters follow
My life story is a graphic novel
Andretti when he smashed the throttle, you're a plastic model
Crafted out of half a bottle of glue won't make it past tomorrow
Your career just hit a massive pothole
I got some knuckles for you fags to swallow
Nasty combos, I got the jabs of Drago
Not for nothing get put in a box if you rush in, ask Apollo
I roam the land smoking these potent plants
My foes should scram, ready to brawl
It's death for all when I'm throwing hands
You know the plan, expect more than swollen glands
When I start choking you chochas like extra small yoga pants
This is your only chance to view the truth in God's mind
Now imbued with the power to make mountains move like a rock slide
And if he's not in your top five, I'm a show these fucking kids the boogeyman does exist, your mom lied

I came to murder you, this verse will break the Earth in two
You a fake snake, somehow you make it work for you
This blade is surgical, your fate ain't reversible
Take it personal when I use your face as a urinal
These raw writtens are jaw shifting
Less talking, more spitting, that's all in the Lord's vision
Abort mission, you frauds don't want to war with him
The only rapper getting endorsement offers from morticians
Live fire, divine rhymer, shine brighter
Type of writer that wrote his first rhyme on a typewriter
King of the mountain I claim higher
The Em that rolled with Mekhi Pfeiffer wouldn't survive in my cypher
Fist to your eye, that's how I high five ya
Wanna compare the dukes, got a pair to shoot [parachute], no skydiver
You about as hard as fine china
Your birth certificate was written with Ricky Martin's guy-liner
Here's some guidelines, don't let your pride blind ya
Side winders will wind up at your side looking to eye spy ya

[Tabs]

And I'm way to fly to be caught in the web of a sly spider
And it's a fact your music attract rats you pied piper
I don't use hook to bait you betas you still a line biter
You homos are Rosemo, you gave the game a nice shiner

[Coal Cash]

You whole style should be hit with some white primer
Fly by nighters missing their targets like a blind sniper

[Tabs]

I might slice ya like a knife fighter
If you wanna grapple I'll crush your Adam's apple into fine cider

[Coal Cash]

We're Krackatoa, twin erupting rhyme geysers
Return of the old kings like how Tolkien described strider

[Tabs]

Divine fire inside of my mind's fibers
My cypher is a prize fighter fighting five bikers inside Rikers

[Coal Cash]

Haha..the black knight riding in on five white tigers
As pyrotechnic igniters light fires and wide spires

[Tabs]

This is what happens when you combine Steiners with Dan Henderson when he was fighting for Pride....[fades out]
