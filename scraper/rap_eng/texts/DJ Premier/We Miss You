[Intro: K.C. Elam]
What's up Uncle Keith?
You know I miss you
Tell Biggie and 2Pac I said what's up
And tell my grandfather I said what's up
Aight, Dad, get that, man

[Verse 1]
Atlanta, Georgia, you was getting the grades
Me and Lennox [?] hustle, getting my pay
You're a Morehouse man, far from the stage
We hung out at [?] every Wednesday
It's crazy, it seems like just yesterday
How quick time pass away
I used to watch New Edition and Mojo used to handle it
I chopped the [?], bagged it and scrammed with it
I had this gift to rhyme hard as shit
You wanted to learn cause you couldn't rhyme for shit
Buttermilk bottom in front of Spellman
We worked it out with Tony Mitchell, never dissed you
You had an issue to tell your fam
That you went to school, now you had to switch your plans
Try to convince them now you's a rapping man
With the dude Suga Bear from Murderpan
At first, it was hard for the judge to swallow
But he had no choice but to follow, it's what it was

[Bridge: Scratches by DJ Premier]
"Don't ever try to underestimate Guru the Great"

[Hook]
Me miss you
We miss you
We miss you
We miss you
We miss you
We miss you
We miss you

[Verse 2]
Back in Boston, we rocked some shows
You got better by the days, liked your flows
Suga Bear and Keithy E., soon to be stars
This was the first edition of the crew, Gang Starr
You and me, and my brother Swave D
Swore to God, we're the new Treacherous Three
Dropped my brother, flipped the script with Mike D
Kept it moving with the Gang Starr street legacy
My addiction to hard white got me locked up
After the while in the bing, guess what popped up
Manifest, nice video, nice dream
I seen you rocking it with your new man Preem
I wasn't hating, I was glad at the fact
That you was trying to put Boston right on the map
And I knew that I'll soon be free
And I hope you had a spot waiting for me, real talk

[Bridge]

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
I remember when you embraced me like a brother
Came to New York so you could show me another
Level of this hip-hop that I dreamed about
Biz Markie, Kane, still walked about
Toured the world, seen all kinds of nations
Formed the crew to hold you down, Gang Starr Foundation
Made money cause of you, bought a crib cause of you
The whole world know me cause of you
And I'm sorry I wasn't there for your last day
Saw your pictures withered away
I wished that I could've save you, but God had to save you
No more clowns would enslave you, real talk
And every time it rain, I'ma think of you
And every time the sun comes out, I'll think of you
Alana's holding it down for little Gu
And my life to you is true, I miss you

[Big Shug talking]
Real talk my man
Lot of people trying to make money off your name and such right now
But we gon' continue the legacy
Me and DJ Premier
And all those around us still
You know what I mean
It is what it is, man
Big Shug
Aha

[Bridge]

[Hook]

[Outro]
And every time it rains, I'm thinking about you
And every time the sun comes out, I'll think about you
Everyday and night
We miss you
We miss you
Guru
Yes we do
Everyday
We miss you
