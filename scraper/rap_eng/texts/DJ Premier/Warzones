... and we're gonna do it like this

[Intro: Pure Ponder]
Ha
Yeah
Preemo
Pure Ponder, Pure Ponder
Jack of All Trades, Jak Spade
I'm on the mic check it out y'all
I'm on the mic check, check it out y'all
I'm about to wreck it
Check it
Check check

[Verse 1: Pure Ponder]
Time to man up in any manner
No matter if 20 platters you spat up
They'd never match up to that of the many raps
That I've written and rapped
Been given a knack of talent
No challenge trying to balance the violence with elements
Those who've seen what I've wrote have voted
And know that a fiend has exploded
Every new note that I note is
'posed to yoke enemies' throats
The heavenly hopes of seventy popes
Know that they can never-endingly cope
With letting me flow
The verbal nerd who swerves words so deadly you don't deserve to even get to behold
So you better be broke
Or get robbed quickly the mics that you've been letting me hold
So in sum you're damaged. I'll manage to smash your ashes
Burnt and dirty, my verbal stings like a bee will leave rashes
In d-d- dayâ€”did I stutter? I
Will butterfly
Like Cassius Clay
A master's aim in a disastrous game
More striking than matches
Except the match heads stay lit
The same shit is heard from everyone else
Stealth is what I've taken from Hell
Yet in Heaven I dwell
I'm number one and I'm running the wealth
Your ass is stuck last between 11 and 12th
I fill them with shells
Of relevant tales
A third of attempt to murder your health
Careful because you will never prevail
Don't get this distorted
This story's ordered in New World Order
History ought to be shot up
The way they wrote it and taught us
Now all our water is taxed
And next the thoughts we thought up
Now what will we tell our daughters
When the globe never gets hotter?
So let's finish the shit they started
Fuck around and you'll get martyred
Harder than any soldier caught up in war zones
Pure Ponder
