[Intro: Krumb Snatcha]
Uh
Premo, D&D y'all, that's right
I want to speak a little truth about what guns is really about 'Cause me being victim of guns
Was an experience of gettin' closer To God

[Verse 1: Krumb Snatcha]
Since the day I was young I had premonitions of an ending to come behind the barrel of the next man's gun
It used to be fun, when I'm the one doin' the clappin'
Now I'm facin' my death, doin' fast breath, no laughin'
How can this happen? Holdin' my chest on the floor
Laid up or sprayed up dreamin' to even the score
Bright lights all I saw, my life flashed before me
From a distance I heard a faint voice steady call me
I guess my time is here, suppress my fear, I'm ready
Tryin' to breathr steady, feelin' my legs gettin' heavy
Lord, don't let me..die this young, without leavin' a son
To carry tradition, listen my life has just become
A nightmare flick, visions of swingin' the poolstick
Depicted by near death, I turn left then pull quick
Lost control of my mind, flipped the safety off the nine
And squeezed, chased 'em down discharging rounds then fell on my knees
Reach for my heart, feeling my chest gettin' hot, I got caught
Vivid memories on how my gun dropped
Bullets in stock, lost all thoughts of me rappin'
Try to catch one 'fore I die for self satisfaction
Get up off my knees, begged the Lord please, picked up the squeeze
Dipped behind cars, bullet shells hittin' the trees
Curse my enemies for being smart enough to take cover
Feelin' my body shudder, as I drop right in front of
The root place as hot shells hit the cheek of my face
Catchin' bloody taste, watch my blood leave trace
Hennessy got me trippin', plus the brew I was sippin'
Feelin' more blood drippin' I see them load a second clip in
Retreated, I've been defeated, my life is ice like popsicles
Open the door, hit the floor of the hospital
It's on

"Gettin' closer to God in a tight situation"
"Let me be your angel and I'll be your protection"
"I stopped breathin', damn, I see demons"

[Verse 2: Krumb Snatcha]
My heart's racin', a casualty in confrontation
Hopin' one day I'll awaken, feelin' my body start shakin'
I've been mistakin', retaliation to come soon
Holdin' my gun wound on the floor of the hospital room
A silent cry for help as I look up at the ceiling
My inner feelin' tellin' me to start healin'
Not in a million, years, I would wanna end here
Wipin' my tears, thinkin' of my long lost career
In this business of rap, now I'm flat on my back
Tryin' to put a place to face on this enemy cat
Cardiac control, I put a hold on my soul
Twenty-two years old and my life done took on some toll
My body fold for numerous feelings I felt
Layin' here lonely, watchin' my homie scream for help
I hear a doctor yellin' directions to the meds
Cut open my threads, bring me to the nearest bed half dead
My inner head screamin', losin' my breathin'
(*scratch* "Damn I see demons")
Don't remember the good Krumb, only the bad one
And now I can tell the depths of hell for evils I've done
Can't run, facin' my worst of fears
Leavin' my physical as my spiritual descends stairs
But wait, this can't be real, I feel the angel Jibreel askin' my name, overlookin' my bloodstained gold chain
Easin' my pain, from where he came I don't know
But he's tellin' me it's not the right time to go
Back in my flo', tubes suckin' the ooze from my mouth
As nurses run about tryin' to send me down south
Who shot ya? That's word from the detect' and the doctor
Before I got flown to Beantown in a helicopter

[Hook: scratched and cut by DJ Premier]
"Gettin' closer to God in a tight situation"
"Let me be your angel and I be your protection"
"I stopped breathin' damn I see demons"
"Gettin' closer to God in a tight situation"

[Verse 3: Krumb Snatcha]
I awake with cold feet feelin' weak and can't eat
Seein' homies stand around, but no sounds, I can't speak
Cheap hospital clothes and patched up bullet holes got me depressed
As I'm lookin' at my legs and my chest
They patched up five, lucky that I had survived
Layin' in bed with a naked head but alive
Recallin' the night before, me tryin' to make sure
I was staggerin' in through the hospital door
[?], then flash to a normal room respitator
Then flashback to me gettin' respite from my savior
I can't understand it, must been the way that they planned it
In my commandment, I'm never takin' life for granted
Rememberin' on my knees, beggin' please
Don't let my soul get seized, lost track of my thoughts
Cause the DT's, came and question me, tested me
Had secrets thoughts of arrestin' me
Stop stressin' me, 'cause ain't no confession see
Funny ain't it, thought I was back in entertainment
Now my image is tainted, cuffed on my crutches for arraignment
Damn!
