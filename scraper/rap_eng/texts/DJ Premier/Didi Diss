Verse 1 - Riley:
Alright, imma break it down real easy
So you don’t get all queasy
When I be spitting on the mic
Like didi let me show you
I understand your diss was a form of expression
But it wasn’t exactly a rap progression
So lemme give you a lesson
In grammatical physics
Cos I’m a scientist, chemist, an astronomical physicist
The fuck you wanna call it
I'm on cornrow Kenny's guest list
It be me and snoop on the loop
Didi you're a nincompoop
I mean I speak the truth
*strewthhhh*
I'm sorry it didn’t work out with ruby
But you came across a little loony
I mean I don’t mean to be rude
Oh, wait… I do *psych*
A-tuck bout to come to the mic
But remember that you are just a mite
I and tam will destroy you to everyone’s delight, second

Verse 2 - A-Tuck:
Here I go, deep type flow
Didier's jokes could never get this low
Riley just destroyed you… BOOM
Just warming up a bit, vroom vroom
It's quite obvious you have never received yourself
I know you're frustrated but dissing just us won't help
Your diss wasn't even a diss
It was just an excuse to live
You didn't diss us in any way so I guess you missed the premise
All of your girls were crazy
Elenie was too lazy
Clair is dating a 30-year-old I guess she's really racy
Milly wanked with Declan
She is not a good lady
Don't mumble in your next diss your words were very hazy
Those blowjob lines were queasy
You've never done anything sleazy
Condom on my forehead because my dick got too greasy
My dick is very meaty
Go eat some tortellini
I will come over to your house and stuff your ass with zucchini
I'm about to hand it to Riley
He will diss you very slyly
And I have little respect for you I don't think of you very highly
Your willy is very tiny
It being big is unlikely
I destroyed you on this diss and it was done very nicely

Verse 3 - Riley:
Yeah I’m back in
I destroy didi like bing ting ling
Now what about the meme team
I’m gonna make your head steam
You steppo and mr.hoare
Selling memes galore
Who the fuck you think you are
I gonna mash ya head up
And slap you on the butt
I only got seven toes
But you got no hoes
I am putting on a show
Now remember maths class
From memory, you tend to come last
It’s like you’re living in the past
When people talk to you
It’s like their breath smells like poo
Cause you never make eye contact
You fucking wombat
A-tuck going to decimate you in his final verse
Your life gonna turn adverse
King k out

Verse 4 - A-Tuck:
Well I’m a sire, I set didier on fire
Rap styles vary and carry like Mariah
I come, from the Shaolin slums, and ill slap your bum
Backhand, then forehand, didi’ll run
So please don’t try jesting, confront me, contesting
You’ll catch a sharp sword to the midsection
With my goong goongs samurai blade, it was handmade
Used to cut me hair with the good fade
Don't claim you’ve had an affair - with clair!
This shit is fire but theres too much shade out there
Tried to go for a normal girl for once
But she ended up turning down her thumbs (RUBY)
King k and I ready for war
Were like gang star, we’lll wash you ashore
The dangerous duo we're a rapport
No vasoline, so we’ll leave your ass sore
Please dont date another wiered girl, im tryna look out for you
The next one will have a fetish for poo
Rain coats and long whites that shits rank
You don't have any style and you're late to the dank (MEMES)
Stop tryna act like yung lean, just admit it
Fuckerooni, you can’t impersonate shit
U suh dude ill hit you with a belt
And, of course, N-A-S are the letters that spell
