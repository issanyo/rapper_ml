[Intro:XL & Gangstarr]

[XL]
Too much XL rap spittin'
Too many of these itty-bitty kitties getting famous off of genie wishes
You can see me, I give no fucks, your luck is up, I'm puffin' on the tree to the stumps
And speaking of stumps, I'm leaving you [?]
Keep on, ducking my pump, I'll leave you with chumps
Straight passing you up, stuck [?]
God let me walk twice, don't show no pity
Keep it, 150 out, you're stuck in the 60's
Any fuckin' pedal you just whippin' the 6-speed
And bitch please, ain't none of y'all better
Make a single move, have your crew step into a set up
Your groupie catchin' the stairs before we walk all over you
Sneak an m9 on the red line, shoot at your altitude
Peaking from the blinds is a tweaking white dealer dude
Fiends parents paranoid I'm a product, ruin the youth

[Outro: Gangstarr]
