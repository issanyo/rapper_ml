[Verse 1]
When I was born I didn't cry, being only kid who could smile
They say your son is a gift and it's my motto for now
And the city I'm living is only place where to start
A road to success and I'll be only lead by my heart
First grade playing soccer, second grade shooting basket
Mama told me to chill, she thought that I'm kinda blasted
Ain't no reason to stop, I'm professional baller
Even when I'm wearing a tank, which coasted a dollar
It is the grade number five, first year in new school
In the begging I'm quiet but then I'm acting a fool
My homies is my support, I trust 'em all of the secrets
We never wanted to study, we were busy with business
Teachers hated us though more than we hated them
Always avoiding the punishment, had a nice working scheme
You tryna look in my side but you can't actually see me
I'm only hundred and eighty, your head is touching the ceiling
But we playing on court, cause I'm still point-thirsty
I never asked for a thank, you never asked for the mercy
Fuck the weather, I'm wearing Bulls' jersey

[Verse 2]
When I was born, you did cry, the king is here, city's mine
A pair of Jordans is the only thing I need to fly
For the love follow us, we gotta stuff to discuss
I'm here alone so I can hear every buzz
And every bar becomes shorter, when it goes on my mind
Haters shouting "u ain't shit", homies say "Nevermind"
I stuck beetwen two H's, I hope I find the right pages
I say thank you to my aces for making me to feel spacious
We doing business in stages, and I see changes in here
To many phrases with the similar endings in here
I'm playing fair, so nobody cares bout your claims
Yeah, that's right - run that's olympic games
It's the grade number nine, I'm still setting the screens
I'm doing Pick & Roll, brother! Where are your skills?
You didn't play for a week, wasting time with a girl
Your team is done, we kicked your ass with 21
I still got loads of thing to learn
But I'm announcing that, it won't take too long
Basketball season has returned

[Verse 3]
Sport's important for you, it's important for me
But don't forget improve you mind, homie, let it be free
And if you disagree, just think what'd happen to you
If you damage your knee, what do you gonna do?
Same team, no games that's what Preemo has done
These beats make my legs ain't never stopping the run
Like Golden State Warriors - the greatest has come
It's 23-0 when I'm writing this song
And I hope it be 0 to 100 for real quick
And all the other teams gon' suck a golden dick
They're making history like Jordan in 1995
They're making history like Kobe Bryant in '05
My homie P gon make the H in american F
He told the name of combination, sounds like bass clef
I hope he'll make it cuz only when he be faded
If coach he respected tells he's overrated
Shit, I'd never say that, fuck, he'll never get that
This song is mine, I do what I think will be better
Oh yeah, I'll put to my letter
