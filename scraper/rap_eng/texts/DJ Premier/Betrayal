[Hook: Guru]
Scandalous, money greed and lust
In this trife life, there ain't nobody you can trust
Plus there's no justice, it's just us
In fact, watchin' yo back it be must
And each and everyday around the way gats bust
And jealous so-called friends'll try to set you up
It's called betrayal

[Verse: Napoleon Da Legend]
I seen the best in friends and I seen the worst in friends
It hurts to see a friendship you were thinking that was worth it end
Got me questioning which criteria determines friends
Some will change like commercial trends and it’s an urgent thing
Some’ll show they truest colors like a nudist that was covered
You discover it a few summers later and then you will suffer
U get fake text back, I tell em lose my number
Picture me making the same mistake like I grew up dumber
Went from hanging everyday to like we barely knew each other
I’ll be aight cause cutting off is nothing to me brother
People don’t play fair and I believe in balance
If you take and take and take I’m a mute u put on silence
And they hate when you call em on they bullshit they culprit
Get off ya pulpit hope you got a coat when the cold hit
That shoulder frozen your nose is growing Pinocchio
Noticed my door was closing couldn’t hold it open so


Mingle with so and so taking flix with this and that
What you reap is what you sow some folks don’t believe in that
Betrayals painful and that’s the devils cradle
Rock you to sleep ya ass gets too comfortable
And then that’s when they play you
That’s why it’s usually the closest ones
That’ll violate ya trust like a serrated knife cut
That’ll a leave a mark like Karl Marx in Russians states
Catch yourself a couple breaks and it
Doesn’t take much for you to see that they
