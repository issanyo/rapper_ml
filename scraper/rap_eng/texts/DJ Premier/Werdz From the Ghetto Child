[Smiley]
Yo, yo
Yo gangsta gangsta, O.G. is what you call me
It's like my life is like a never-endin drug story
Make coke, expand, yo you know who I am
Death percentages rises in the hood like grams
Who done it and ran, who blammed on my fam'
Out the window every night, deadly intentions man
Cocked back and ready to fire, hit man for hire
And fuck politicians, nothin but liars
As I build my cream, with self esteem
But drink the water from the streams, of gangsta lean
To keep food on my plate, stick a mac to your face
So I never have to fall off, so you can never underrate
Force pressure, is the techniques of real men
So when you slam the doors, we still get in
It's like demons when, what you fight that you can't see'll
Come out your buildin, and get shot drastically
The way of the world, niggas fiendin to pull it
You either bite the dust, or just dodge that bullet
