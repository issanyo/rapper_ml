Ayo, this is Bahamadia's Kollage
A collection of lyrical and musical art that brings forth her masterful contribution to the hip-hop world
And as we move on into the future y'all, we must heed the signs y'all, build with minds y'all
Always think of the children and always be true to ourselves
And for those who don't know yet, in this rap stuff, kid, we come with mad originality, creativity, and intensity
So maintain and heed the lady's words, a'ight?
True
