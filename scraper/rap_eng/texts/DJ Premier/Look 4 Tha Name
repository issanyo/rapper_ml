[Verse One]
Yo, put on my sounds, hit the bass up
Hoes, put on pounds, get your weight up
I'm in the game now, take ya crown and all the posters?
You better take it down and all the chauffeurs?
Better make ya 'round, you get a phone call
You better make it now, I came to shut shit, the gate is down
Y'all non descript
And the drama that I bring is beyond the script
A lot of chicks coming up but to sum it up
I used to feel a lot of shit, now I'm numbing up
I take advantage, triple what your advance is
The chance is Slim like Eminem
Blade wanna make advances
Something every week drop
A few wanna scope, hoping to find a weak spot
But I'm on point as you see in my name
On a bad night I'm still MVP of the game
That's right niggas

[Hook]

[Sonja talking]
Yo Primo yo, switch the beat up. Let's take it to the streets for these niggas

[Verse Two]
Middle finger out the sun roof, blowing through the intersection
No holds barred, flow is hard like an erection
Unmarketable, made remarkable
I hold my ground like the carpet do
No crews, no news, I reign at showbiz
You hate? That's yo' biz
Nobody as hot as the flow is
Sho' is, nigga Blade's rhymes pose a
Threat, wanna bet? Nigga playtime's over
S holder
I'm like blood cause I stay in the cut
Push your album back when I'm laying a cut
Play severe, Blade/Premier and the way we Bond is like James
Got flow like Avian
Black AV on
Full figured
Pull niggas like triggers
Blaow
Conceited chick, head high pose, Bed Stuy flows
It's drama when I drop like thermometers cold
What?

[Scratch Hook]
"Just look for the name"
"Sonja Blade"
"You can say what you want but spell my name right"
"You want war? Yes or no"
"They spread the effect of the rap"
"Just look for the name"
"Sonja Blade"
"You can say what you want but spell my name right"
"You want war? Yes or no"
"So ill"
"Talk slick all you want"

[Verse Three]
Yeah I know you motherfuckers probably had it with me
But I'm in it for the doe it don't matter with me
Y'all chicks be cute and shit but need help with songs
Got a little clique but everything else is wrong
Look, don't get gassed dear, cause for the past year
I wrote millennium hits, shit you tried last year
And this is my realm, you ain't gon' last here
I'll call the cashier, to get my cash here
Get the mold for my gear, rocks all in my ear
Blade on my neck and it's not for nothing
Rolly with the pink face like the watch is blushing
Whoo
You see that shit, believe that shit
So I never sweat niggas I'm too cold for that
Picture me hating on a bitch, I'm too old for that
And if y'all want to get it on, I'mma hold you to that
I know my shit is double plat' if you ain't gold for that
