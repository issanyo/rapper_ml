[Spoken Intro]
Look, it's all or nothing, baby
Are you in or are you out?
If not, I gotta let you go

[Verse 1]
Almost made you love me, almost made you cry
Almost made you happy, babe, didn't I, didn't I
You almost had me thinkin', you were turned around
But everybody knows, almost doesn't count

[Verse 2]
Almost heard you sayin', you were finally free
What was always missin' for you, babe, you found it in me
But you can't get to heaven, half off the ground
Everybody knows, almost doesn't count

[Bridge]
I can't keep on lovin' you one foot outside the door
I hear a funny hesitation of a heart that's never really sure
Can't keep on trying if you're lookin' for more
Than all that I could give you, than what you came here for

[Verse 3]
Gonna find me somebody, not afraid to let go
Want a no doubt be there kind of man, you came real close
But every time you build me up, you only let me down
But everybody knows, almost doesn't count
Almost doesn't count

[Bridge]
Hey...hey...hey...hey...
Can't keep on, baby; can't keep on trying
Everybody knows, almost doesn't count
I can't keep on...
I can't keep on lovin' you one foot outside the door
I hear a funny hesitation of a heart that's never really sure
Can't keep on trying if you're lookin' for more
Than all that I could give you, than what you came here for

[Verse 4]
Maybe you'll be sorry, maybe you'll be cold
Maybe you'll come runnin' back, babe, from the cruel, cruel world
Almost convinced me, you're gonna stick around
But everybody knows, almost doesn't count
So maybe you'll be here, maybe I'll see you around
That's the way it goes, almost doesn't count
