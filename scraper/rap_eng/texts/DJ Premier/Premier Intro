[DJ Premier]
Yeah, the time is now
Yeah, for all real niggas to step up
Fake niggas, step the fuck back; this is not for you
This is the real shit, always been the real shit
M.O.P., muthafuckas (First Family!)
Yeah, first of all, we would like to apologize for all the real niggas waiting for this album to drop
We do not apologize to all you fake ass niggas, for you are not important to us
It's official, we Warriorz, baby; cock and squeeze
This year, I hope we don't have to prove ourselves to you again
For this is home team
I repeat, First Family, M.O.P., salute
