(Evidence) (is at the door)
What's up (with the dope rhyme that I kick)
(Evidence) (is at the door)
(With the dope rhyme that I kick) Yeah, uh
(Now it's time for me to make my impression felt)

[Verse 1: Evidence]
I was guarded as an artist from the first day I started
I lowered my voice deep and tried to rap hardest
Thinking back, I wasn't letting 'em in
Even when they're knocking at the door and telling me to win
I felt like losing, like, "How could I be worthy"?
My friends did it big and my friends did it early
Met a lot of people I admired, inspired by their talent
I looked the other way if they was criminal or violent
Mic stand, booth and an ASR
Pantyhose from my mother clothes, and I lay a bar
Lay 'em all together, then I make a song, feeling like I made a hit
Go to class, play the shit, the day is what you make of it
(Fucking crazy) I make it mine 'cause my eyes are open
'Cause no one will do it for ya, so I keep 'em peeled and scoping
As an ode to my mom, what the camera's shooting solo
While my fans wait for music leaving comments on a photo

[Verse 2: Evidence]
Same vinyl crates, but I'm coming up with new flips
On my classic, like karate kid and blue chips
I don't wanna see my fans broke or be bitter
And I don't wanna see my heroes slanging verses on their Twitter
(Ayy) Everyone's an imitation
Spitters cop the G Rap, the rest are on some Drake shit (right)
I took my time to find my own shit, 10,000 hours
No borrow type or loan shit, 'cause I'ma own it
Burning bridges, there's nowhere to go but forward
I strike the match, then I'm caught up in the moment
But never in my feelings when I'm dealing with opponents
I dead 'em first, and their scalp is just a bonus
"The alpha dog, quiet, quiet, and honest"
You'd make our paper euro, dollar, yen, kronas"
My mother said I'd understand when I was grown up
Well, here I am, graduating with diplomas

(Evidence, Evidence, Evidence, Evidence) (is at the door)
(With the dope rhyme that I kick)
