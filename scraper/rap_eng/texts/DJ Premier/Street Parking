30 years on the force, the course of history changed
People hot 'cause they be sick of the pain
Another innocent shot, another officer slain
The people in charge, they just talk
And they ain’t doing a thang!
In this market they always targeting something to blame
Why? 'Cause the cash is the king, cha ching
You really think a couple pickets and spitting a couple lyrics
A rally appearance will stop the currency train? OK
Lemme tell me you lil' something that I learned
About the nation that we living in
Everything surrounds around dividends
From the ground down to the farms
To urban cities up to presidents
It's all connected with cream
You got credit, buy the American Dream
But stay in your place buddy 'cause freedom ain’t free
We preach love while saying it’s peace
While taking his piece, meanwhile we’re gripping AR-15s
You know what I mean?
Schools not even as safe it seems
We’re fed violence all day so we hate us in dreams
Changing trains from A to the E to the G
During the short walkway through the station, what do I see
Matt Damon with a big-ass gun, Kim K with her big-ass butt
The Rock sitting in a big-ass tub, it’s guns, sex, materialism
I don’t think it’s a problem 'cause I’m old, for me, so it isn’t
But I just think about the children on their way to the school
Rocking supreme, palace, dabbin', whatever that's cool
See, I don’t know because I’m just out of it
I’m just thinking 'bout what they surrounded with
I mean, this was always around but the difference now
Is we’re allowing it, proud of it
Glorifying it and evil sells, so we be buying it
The same people saying the generation is aimless supplying it
So what the fuck is this system and why am I in it?
The next president, prolly puppets
Who’s gonna win it? Clinton! I mean prolly Trump is
And I'm just getting by, vibing to Donnie Trumpets
And writing lyrics to supply you with
Some rhymes with substance
Word is bond
A lil' something something from me, hope you love it
Beloved, raw doesn’t always have to mean rugged
It means they ain’t reach me yet
Hip-hop started out for positivity but they like please forget
We could do it though
Running and running and running and running
And running and running and running running
We could do it though
