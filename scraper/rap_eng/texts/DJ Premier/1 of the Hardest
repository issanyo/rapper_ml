[Intro: Royce Da 5'9"]
I swear I'm one of the hardest niggas that's out here doing this shit right now
I swear I'm one of the hardest niggas that's out here doing this shit right now

[Verse 1: Royce Da 5'9"]
Swear I'm the truth, holmes
I'm that blue chrome coupe with the roof gone
Thats two-tone, I'm that dudes own, talking on two phones
While my new hoes eat out my palm like, like one of my loot homes
Like all night, I'm the product of Group Home
I'm a superstar like Lupe Fiasco's The Cool
Save your theatrics for fools
I'm a Alcatraz spazzes, spittin' Alcatraz, blastin' pistols
Numbing the laughin' gas, the niggas is gassin'
To be the best you gotta have the respect
I do the same to you that I do to the alphabet
I put the A, the B, the C, D, E, and the F in the back of a EMS
Before I go back to doing anything in rap for a G unless
I black but niggas like DMX, don't bark, it's dark and Hell is hot like a furnace is
When I was 16 caught the same clap pop taught me about when I was turning 6
I guess I just wasn't listenin',  bet you still couldn't hold a candle to my burnin' dick
My wife whip like nice stick, life lit like a burnin' wick, stay sharper than a icepick
You'll probably have to measure my clip by height and width
Try me then I will just put the writing on the wall like fuckin' hieroglyphs
I'm in the street like tire skids, I admit

[Chorus: Royce Da 5'9"]
I'm one of the hardest niggas that's out here doing this shit right now
I swear I'm one of the hardest niggas that's out here doing this shit right now

[Verse 2: Royce Da 5'9"]
Swear I'm the answer, got angels floatin' around my niggas that's angry Locin'
Like trigger the gamblers, move the hustle nigga my language broken
My lyrics is written for like-minded individuals, age appropriate
The cage is open to all of you animal rappers, I got a old chick
With vintage vagina who look just like Angela Bassett
I got a young cute chick who look just like Dej Loaf
And I take em both to the days end, I wake up focused
Go to sleep with the face of ages, here to with the ears of focus
Buggin' on these niggas and then I pray for roaches
I'm Doctor Oz and Doctor Bombay, Ryan's a popular hombre
For those of y'all who play ferocious, I am like Harambe
I take your wife and fiance, I take your life and ya mom's egg
So I don't pull no muscle flippin' nobody off
I take advice with my arms raised, I'm the incredible
I got the chart remains of the dead in my cellar spoof
I got celery chart, Romaine in my lettuce juice
I got 2 pistols, I let 'em loose called Betty Boop and Petty Sue
I leave venom in every booth, I'm reinvented
Head on a beach in Venice from a chick from Finland
Who's finished, as soon as she's finished I tell her you finished
Because I'm

[Chorus: Royce Da 5'9"]
One of the hardest niggas that's out here doing this shit right now
I swear I'm one of the hardest niggas that's out here doing this shit right now
I swear
