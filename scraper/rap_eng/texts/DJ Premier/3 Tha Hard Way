[Verse 1: Bahamadia]
Salutes to action be the latest en-t-ry for 'Illadel colonies
To get the cream like cherries jubilee
My steeze put you at ease like methamphetamines
Or like Tony Starks fantasies about his wallabees
Too fitting, yada mean? Big East be comin' through
Ghetto magic plus the bullies back it what
Me now Buddah Blessed for I and I
Provide da greatest naturale pure as life that exit from the gentatile
Styles international like direct connects from internet
Verbal text blossom like Chia Pets
Perfect with the mic devices Bahamadee be the nicest
Bringin' this rap thing to the light like Osiris
For the Nine pound etc
Peace to Gang Starr and my nigga K-Sarrah

[Hook]
"We gonna rock this motherfucker like Three The Hard Way"

[Verse 2: K-Swift]
Ayo, I'm doing this for the crews claimin' that they're better
I'm tickled, ya must be like Sanford on the ripple little by little
I kick verses of the middle of my brain
The Riddler couldn't fuck wit Kannon Riddles
I remain the undisputed, you should've known if you knew it
Montell couldn't tell you how we do it
If you got the chance to even do the battle dance with the Kannon Band
Shit be slammin' more than Larry Nance
And plus it's in me to give you more like Demi
I do it easy, leave the hard-a-way to penny
As I display skills for what it's worth
Sent to this Earth to put the curse of wack MCs upon my turf
This is the end like Armageddon, you're settin' a bad example
Niggas still using samples times ample
Yo Swift never said she was the baddest but I kept it real
You niggas frontin', talkin' 'bout you packin' steel
You be sportin' a foot all up in rectum
By them Central kids sittin' all up in the bully section
Wreckin'

[Hook]
"We gonna rock this motherfucker like Three The Hard Way"
"We gonna rock this motherfucker like Three The Hard Way"
"We gonna rock this motherfucker like Three The Hard Way"

[Verse 3: Mecca Starr]
Do you remember those you chose to forget back when ya ears was wet?
And now ya preachin' me releasin' mini-tec
I need a mic check because the static comes sporadic
Emcees be hooked like addicts while casualties stay tragic
There ain't no glamour in that story, all guts no glory
Entrenced in jealousy just like the suckers who abhor me
They tell but they don't know the core, so raw is now my reference
Like Mumia there is no evidence to say I am more than I am
Undbending, never ending similar to million men
Me say "just us" you say "me bust bust"
Mental stagnation like the cancer patients eatin' cow fuss
As the minds rust
From dawn to dusk I rest in Mecca
The words sound power as in energy see Heka
To die because ya black simply be no cause at all
Surreality just like the lengends of the fall
Initial looks of the shook hearted kids who shouldn't started
Lyrics leave like spirits and the waters Moses parted
Do or Die's ya slogan but niggas slip with Trojans
Major mental corrosion like Murray's meat unfrozen
I am the Chosen, Earth, Sun, Moon and stars
Hard for me to find a top contender just to spar
Some peep the exterior and think inferior
Next ya know they callin' for a Sound Bwoy Burial
D&D Studio be wicked, catch wreck for infinity
One love peace to Bahamadi'

[Verse 4: Bahamadia]
Like Salt-N-Pepa I take it to the next plateau
Niggas scream they what this Brown Sugar like D'Angelo
I make it better fo' fantanics fienin' for the butter, boo
Like 25 to lifers do from lack of gettin' power; you
Oh, I put my little thing in action, smooth like satin
Or Special Ed when he was taxin'
Heads relax and play the back when I spill
I regulate a flow like chicks on birth control pills
Ill anitics, keep it movin' on
Bouncin' like nylon from 'Illadel to Lebanon (no doubt)
It's 3 Tha Hard Way

[Hook]
"Three The Hard Way"
