[Intro]
On the phone : Ayo Nas ! I don't know how to start this shit either man
Okay, Let's go !

[Verse 1]
Y'all Welcome to the black house city of dreams
Nightmares, dark shades, it ain't nothing nice to see
Bitches in the fight, Gays fuck for free
Crack dealers walk along of these city streets
Pissed off car noises, make me feel so nervous
Each with their own siren, they drive fast and furious
I know what they drivin' for, some ambulance dishes !
The doctor asked for, so they might be so delicious
Stoned Homeless screaming ask you when you walk all alone
They think nice dressed people won't be poor
White Buildings and Houses increase more and more
So why homeless people they increase more and more
Not the way it was suppose to be but that how we do
Walking in empty alley like you hit the death row
Gangs of streets I can see the blood in sewers long
Flows cold between rats,  the smell breaks all the bones
No angels fly in the sky even in the daylight
Letting the demons gain all the commandments of rights
But Yo! No one wins, even the dark knight
In the black jungle he lost the light no sight no good night
That where the city when the city never sleeps
I'm afraid to sleep'cuz the death is the cousin of sleep
So I stay wide awake hustling running hiding from police
They chase me and my bros'cuz in the street we don't snitch
It got black roses which got a lot of thorns
They buzzing all the time, different people different cons
Different bitches all, dig deep the same hole
Different teens wear boots and fuck rich olds
A lot of women I meet you're trying to recall
I've never knew there's a streap club behind these walls
Be there, I try to walk in these grey clouds
Girls're dancing and the waiters pick the money they throw
Multi-lingual, multi-religious in the same crowd
Some fools play the swords and scream so loud
They think a life is game, but how ?
North and south go against the mothafucker law
Going here for a bill to take the shit going there
Drug dealer chic even the cops getting scared
You mothafucker bitch I got no time to spare
But I've been living here for years and I ain't go nowhere bitch

[Hook]
I ain't go nowhere bitch... I ain't go nowhere yeah!

[Verse 2]
Be having dreams that I have a castle
Black Knights, building pecs, make sure my body stay intact
Then I stepped They all prostrate
Princesses with white head kiss in the bath, never have a time to be sad...
But just a wigger, walking with his finger on the trigger
His only desire is to kill a mothafucker chigger
I ain't a type of wigger made for you to start messing
I ain't dissin' I give a lessons you better start to listen
Having a rap flow, beat, mic and shelter
Hip hop ain't just a music is a it's a whole culture
With the Dj's, my Freestyles plays, the vinyl strays
Dumb ass bitches amazed, Haters they still hate
Back to the black, city is still infect, human rats
From what I see in the movies when the movie is the fact
I'm living where the city is dark black
The people fight to get light, I don't mind, I mean I thought I was white
And lamp like a boss, it's full of hoes
Who get short luxury life, fake and flooded with cums
I gotta too many skills, but I'm not so famous
Life is similar to Hell but nobody cares
And be ambitious, though we live dangerous
Cops could just arrest me, beating us, treating us like criminals
It's only right that I was born to use mics
Not to use nines you got a problem drop the guns lets fight
I take rappers to my new castle, through rap slow
I don't sell my soul to be in a BET live show
The smooth tongue move when the beat breaks
When I spit, it dances like Shakira when the reed pipe hisses
The city never sleeps, full of villains and geeks
That's where I learned to hide a scalpel had to scuffle with freaks
I'm addicted to my speakers, Raping and meeting girls like Emeers
In the street I can meet ya, the Tech I can teach ya
I don't do hack shits, you better ask mad kids
I never sleep, 'cause sleep always awakes my nightmares
In my city, the good and the bad always met
Nothing's equivalent to Casanegra state of mind

[Hook]
Casanegra state of mind... Casanegra state of mind. Yeah !
Freezy Mayne in the house bitch !
