Yo, I done had 20 racks and blew it all to the ground
I sold nickel bags and peddled the pounds
Can't even talk drugs
And bitches in my city that was saying my name
Snotty nose used to pitch in the rain
Now my bitch play with my dick in her range
She start beef and I'm just catching a flight
It's probably drugs if I'm sipping the sprite
You know my life; drink, smoke, roll some dice
Shoot the club up on opening night
Hit a bitch in the wig, tall nigga got caught in the leg
I hit the sherm and go dump at the feds
I'm on your block, come kill me
Them purple stars, was doing them filthy
Ruined lives and I ain't never felt guilty
Nigga walk with me
A couple racks at the sound of a chirp
I'm smoking dope while I'm bagging the work
In the building, at the top of the staircase
Probably getting top on the staircase
Fiends take a bump and can't stand straight
Yeah, I'm a firm believer in God
But it get cloudy when them times get hard
It make a nigga wanna get up and rob
Wasn't for me a lotta niggas would starve
They needed work so I give 'em a job
Feed your peoples nigga
A lotta niggas don't share them views
So the TV gotta share that news
You know the streets and these made up rules
All cause niggas ain't pay them dues
They show up 'tarted with some beat up shoes
Shit is wicked and most of these niggas is duck
Just keep it tucked or you pressing your luck
You know the peeps get to searching the truck
They smelled weed now they bringing in dogs
Running your name, thirsting to give you a charge
Take you to county, wanna show you the bars
Speak on beats just to share my world
Ain't had no money, had to sell that girl
Road the bike and ignored all stops
You played them books and I played them blocks
So what you know about waking up in the middle of a situation
They had your dog, wanna ask you questions at the station
Said they know that you was slanging the work
Somebody rolled and threw your name in the dirt
Toss you a jumper, got you changing your shirt
The wristband with the date of your birth
Jail sucks, but intake is the worst
Called you names tryna break you apart
Set your bail, now you know where to start
Thinking it was numbers that you know by heart
And it's all for the love of the fetti
I cop a soda and a dutch from the ghetti
A lot of niggas that I run with is petty
But them my niggas, what the fuck you gon' tell me?
Selling bags and stealing shit out the deli, nigga
