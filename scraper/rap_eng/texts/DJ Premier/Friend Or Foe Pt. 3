[Intro]
I been waiting 20 years
Shit, I been waiting 20 years
Waiting 20 years

[Hook]
You was thinking Cold Crush back then on the move
But you gon' rethink it all when I'm finished with you
You was thinking Cold Crush back then on the move
But you gon' rethink it all when I'm finished with you

[Verse 1]
Friend or foe yo, state my biz?
They always said revenge is slow so, here it is
20 years in the making
I been waiting more or less
More so to draw slow
And Picasso your chest, let me back track
'96 flexing, you ran across a bredren
Hands on a trunk full, tap dance stepping
Perico stretching, small town juggling
Tryna do the 1st to the 15th and be done with it
He was down in Newport, you was on your way there
Both of y'all from New York, one of y'all should've stayed there
Both tryna play there
A come up was a given
But when the aim's the same
You shooting at a collision, so you stick him
Caught him on the humble on his way out
Surrounded him, reached on your waist and pulled the trey out
Room keys led to a few ki's
That's how the game go, none of that shit confuse me
But like a year later he was back south, motel 6'ing
You was juggling Rap City and stove whipping
You found him, gave him demands over the business
Then clapped him, one in the stomach like "good riddance"
And this is, where the story change on the dial
Cause he died saying "all he would ever miss is his child"
And speaking of, know that that child ain't been a child in forever
20 years just decided to catch up
And here we are
And the look on your face is so upsetting
Cause I was looking for Iceberg based on your records
Come on, where the cool at?
Where the "cough up a lung" face screw at?
What's up with the panic?
You don't do that
But you never would've knew that
The dude you was booking
Had a baby 10 minutes away from you in Brooklyn
Cause me? I'm from Tompkins
The same ones you said run their mouths just like y'all
And was foul just like y'all
Is it foul that I got in here by leaving a rack with the receptionist?
You'd call it money well invested
And I'm with, two heaters, Bluetooth speakers
My theme music blaring
Serenade you with "Ether", let's do it
You was catching bodies and escaping
Then bragging about it to 20,000 on stages
Imagine, having to grow up without a dad and
Being reminded of how you lost him through a playlist
And waiting, to be in this office with all your ranks
And all your Basquiats and your floor seats and all your bank
And all your goons, lined up in adjoining rooms
Are now alumni from Harvard
Why would you even bother?
So it's me and these two 9's
Rounding up applause
And yea I thought about how you might have one in the drawer
But I was like "nah, duke Lemonad'ing with his woman
And he ain't been tough since like '98 or something"
And something gotta give
I'm like, "this mu'fucka went and took a father from his kid
So now I'm walking him from his"
And "him" being YOU
Either that, or empty out them Swiss's you done you grew
Like a Swisher on the stoop
Stop itching when you move
Keep it De La cool
Or all of this will turn into reverse déjà vu
And you from Marcy, and Marcy don't raise no rats
So you gonn' keep your mouth closed while I take these plaques
And I ain't old enough to buy yo' spade
But I'm old enough to yap it from inside yo' place, throw me a case
See my mind's like a flower in bloom
They celebrating while I'm dedicating
Guess I'm outta the loop
20 years I been plotting for now, call it war
20 years outta pocket and now?
I'm all in yours
And money comes in quick but leaves out faster
So I'm paying Dame tomorrow for them Reasonable Doubt masters
Now do something...

[Hook]
You was thinking Cold Crush back then on the move
You gon' rethink it all when I'm finished with you
You was thinking Cold Crush back then on the move
But you gon' rethink it all when I'm finished with you
Friend or foe, right?
