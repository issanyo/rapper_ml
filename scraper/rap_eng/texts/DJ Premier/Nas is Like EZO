[Intro: EZO]
Listen

[Verse 1: EZO]
Freedom or jail, clips inserted, a baby's being born
Same time my man is murdered, the beginning and end
As far as rap go, it's only natural, I explain
My plateau, and also, what defines my name
EZO put it in your cell phone
E as in three for the Holy Trinity
Z in the 9 perfection from rhyme to delivery, God
O, 6 for i am human and my existence is to be flawed
I'm the rhyming Medina
Have you green like the reefer of the fever
Want to be battling?
I'll leave you scrambling fro words like we was Scrabbling
It's Maddening when you get to the big stage
And spike it, you throw away the game
Joell taught me how to rap
Biggie taught me how to craft
Nas showed me that the game is about more than that
EZO is like a lyrical drug
Ketamine in a slug
Fuck rapping the lights out, goodbye to the utilities, roof, and the rug
My mixtape don't go gold, I'll give the Kanye shrug
Guess the game really is in the hole that it dug
Skill made Chance my friend in this rap game
Like, Vic, Mensa as my, nick name
I'm 16, looking for a Super Freak like Rick James
Cold blooded when i Kick the Urban Rapsody, but I Get Money like Wayne and T-Pain
Insane the number of lines in his brain
Such a quick claim when you see he used the simplest rhyme in the game
Go back and forth like a dope tennis match
I stay in line like 4 bars of Kit-Kat
Come at me it's a mismatch
One eight seven over the dispatch
