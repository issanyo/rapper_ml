[Intro]
Yeah, yeah
Ayo B, it's time (it's time ?)
Aight, let's get it
Yeah, straight out the dungeons of unhealthy rap
Where your trainer know how to rap
Yo this the coach
Bust how I start this (RBG Fit !)

[Verse 1]
Yeah, lyrics I had to flip 'em
I'm just tryin' to give 'em what I'm livin'
Nutrition, my body in condition
Through pain, cut like Scarface, Fit-Hop lane
Lethal like M-16, healthy, my pen on green
Now, bad habits, had to delete those
I get it in my street clothes
Comfortable training, keep my eyes closed
Y'all know my steelo
Healthy music, no air play
I stopped the E&J
Smokin' blunts up in the stairway
I'm still on the corner rollin' dice with the cee-lo champs
Do it for push-ups, playin' 'til my muscles cramp
Embrace the soreness, bad diets I'm off it
Pull-ups with the legs on lift to keep the core ripped
The TV lyin' callin' mens are shootin'
Time to start the revolution
Wake the homies that's in Houston
Bro' they caught us off guard, with that lean they put in fashion
My mind and my body on train like an assassin
Used to act up, made brothers back up
My young stint, beef all over New York, was livin' mad quick
Now I do mixed greens, fresh fruit, almond milk
I'm attaining new degrees and belts, gettin' my skills up
Health's the topic, get yours in order 'fore it's danger
Exercise is one of the ways, you've got so many chambers
I'm talkin' healthy mind and healthy body
Tryin' to get the children right so they could be as right as I be (so what you sayin' ?)
It's like the game need to change
Got little homies killin' they livers with these pills and these liquors
The plague's up on us
Those without knowledge are goners
The food ain't right
Curb that meat they put up on us
Right 'fore they enslaved us, sugar's the new crack
Binge eatin' that back to back
I had to stop all that
You know you rich if you healthy, otherwise you not
So clean your diet 'fore your insides stop
I know this heardhead who says he gon' eat what he want
He still breathin' so therefore he gon' live how he want
But yo, your body goin' through invasion
Inside organs aching, battlein' infiltration for the mutation
It drops deep like the truths that they kept
I get my sleep
'Cause I know the importance of rest
Beyond the walls of intelligence, body and mind
Drink alkaline, because I got a healthy paradigm

[Hook]
Healthy state of mind (x4)

[Verse 2]
Truth be told I'm still a gangsta
Minus MoÃ«t and the Tec's
Mind of a warrior, aware of all the threats
My health is my stock
I'm bigger than the blocks and sellin' rocks
Goin' to jail, avoidin' cops
A father figure, not walkin' with his finger on the trigger
Pourin' up lean until my body gets sicker
I ain't the type of brother made for you to start testin'
My Jiu Jitsu lesson break 'em down in a second
Health is my cash flow, food and shelter
Whenever frustrated, hit the bag like cancer
In the PJ's, my mixtape plays, healthy's the wave
No more speedin' to graves, real G's switch up they ways
Man, the trap's wack, facts, plus the county is packed
From what I hear in all the stories when the homies come back
Black, I'm livin' where the nights is jet black
I meditate to weave that, slip that
Through stillness, achieve that
Went green on my own, left junk alone
This the real luxury life, skin shinin' like stones
Homes, I wrote so many rhymes, through infections of my brains
Spit survivors of my hell and I must maintain
Want it prosperous, 'though it was dangerous
Cops could just arrest me, blamin' us
We held like hostages
It's only right I tell the homies what's right
Now the stuff that I write, it's like a map for your life
I'm takin' rap to a new plateau, Fit-Hop bro'
My rhymin' is a detox pill without a capsule
The OG on 'ine shake
Never put me in your box 'cause my body's in shape
I don't do nothin' weak, strength train in my sleep
My martial art trainin' help me how to work on my tweaks
I'm a addict for sneakers, teachings from Buddha
Get Chi from the teachers
In the streets I can reach ya
I'm the coach, i teach ya
Inhale deep, find the calmness in breath
I get my sleep, 'cause I know the importance of rest
I give thanks to the troubles had in earlier times
Nothing's equivalent, to gainin' healthy state of mind

[Hook]
Healthy state of mind (x4)
