[Verse 1]
I'm in the zone
Don't feel like staying home
Cuz for now i don't wanna be alone
I'm feeling like it's my day
There's no better time to party than a Friday
Pick out my clothes call my friends
Pop some dro, now let's begin

[Hook]
Wenting out getting out not staying in the house
Call my friends make some plans
Finding out what time the party begins
Hanging out for the weekend
Get out the crib have some fun
Enjoy yourself live for once
'Cuz you'll never ever know when your time is up
So you've got to live it up

[Verse 2]
Now it's about 10 o'clock
Before I leave I'll have some Henny on the rocks
Pick out my fit you see, some fitted jeans
No make up just a little vaseline
I'm feeling fresh, I'm feeling clean
Grab my CD's so i can blast it through the streets
Pick up my homegirls a cop a touch
Get it twisted while we're on our way into the club

[Hook]
Wenting out getting out not staying in the house
Call my friends make some plans
Finding out what time the party begins
Hanging out for the weekend
Get out the crib have some fun
Enjoy yourself live for once
'Cuz you'll never ever know when your time is up
So you've got to live it up

[Verse 3]
Live your life with absolutely no regrets
No need for contemplating death
'Cuz you'll look back and miss everything that you have and
Party for the night, do what you gotta do
If you need some encouragement i ain't even mad at you
Do what's right and know that everything will be alright
It'll be alright
Celebrate life, celebrate hustling
Pop some dro' for all our money doubling
All my ladies that stick to the ruggedness
Smoke some dro' with cats that stay thugging it
It's our life we gon' live it up
Party all night till we see the sun coming up
Celebrate the weekend
Don't forget we gon' celebrate every single day that we breathing

[Hook]
Wenting out getting out not staying in the house
Call my friends make some plans
Finding out what time the party begins
Hanging out for the weekend
Get out the crib have some fun
Enjoy yourself live for once
'Cuz you'll never ever know when your time is up
So you've got to live it up
