[Interlude: Bumpy Knuckles talking]
Always paid attention to how many cats I rocked with and who I worked with on projects and everything
Because, you know, what's important is to stay focused on the growth of your brand
You know, every MC is a brand, you know, whether they want to admit it or not
You know, at lot of cats running around here screaming how they just love hip-hop so much and they rock for the love and all that
Wish I could walk into Best Buy and say, "yo, I've been buying from y'all for mad years, yo, and it would be my honor if y'all let me rock one of them flat screens right there."

[Intro]
Premo
Yeah
Bumpy Knuckles
DJ Premier
Let's rock

[Verse]
There used to be money in the hood then crabs started having baby crabs
And all of them niggas wanted to be Scarface
While I stayed on my Oliver Stone and wrote images
Bodying top MC's, you lost scrimmages
Mic on amp it, the warrior holler is how I stamp it
Stash spots popped open
We're at war with the people, loyalty is a deal maker
Still royalty's a deal breaker
Mic check one two is what I do
Before I spit that real nigga shit at you
I spit that MC tsunami that will have you niggas crying to your mommy
Punk try me
C'mon

[Hook "w/ Scratches by DJ Premier"]
"Focused man"
I never put my focus away
Underground, boom-bap, Bump's dropping
"Focused man"
I mix it with the vocals I lay
OGs show the streets really was popping

[Verse 2]
Peep niggas' verses, subliminal bitch shit
I bitchslap rappers who bitch quick
Eyes swole, bitch quick, hit you with the biscuit
And grab the mic and butter the room like a biscuit
Soaked into the mind of rhymes will make you feel like you can do it
Like the Nike sign, fuck what you wear
Can you write these rhymes that don't conform?
Can you spit it over and over in classic form?
Yo, streets playing dirty
A hot 16 will get you 30 years when keeping it real goes wrong
Black man, I put the pen in composition
Destroy competition, our soldiers in position
I'm loyal to my pen, you're loyal to your chain
That you bought with your little advance and not cocaine
Real niggas got their hammers out, my niggas wilding out
I think you need to leave the violence out

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
I was born a follower who learned to lead
Amongst low-life shitbags who burned in greed
Criticize me when you reach my level
Until then, just admire my style of fire, it's fire
I built on mistakes and learned from them
Studied from my enemies and learned from them and never turned from them
The higher you fly, the smaller you'll appear to the eye
To those hate-weighted niggas on ground level
Devils

[Hook]

[Outro]
Salute to the game
Don't ever put your focus away
