(Hook)
I’m trying to make millions and millions and millions
I’m trying to make millions and millions and millions
I’m trying to make millions and millions and millions
I'm trying to make millions and millions and millions
I'm trying to make millions and millions and millions
I'm trying to make!

(1st Verse)
‘Lotta speculation ‘bout the crackers of this nation
Californication
Nerds got the weed system growing like Jamaicans
Step into the pan. Get it flipping bacon
I’m the sinner of Satan
I’m addicted to patience
Popury Importum. Gotta grace this
I’m rolling up a blunt to Johnny Blaze shit
Barbie doll standing there in amazement
You don’t move soon you’ll be stuck in ancient
What the fuck is past to the present?
I’m asking y’all like any mattered opinion will be measured
And that’s false of course
That’s like asking what’s better between Golf or Porsche
I’m 911 GT
Guess that’s why you didn’t see me coming like a DT
Low-key. The key; I’m low
And the way a nigga blow, I’m ‘bout to come underneath
Finally found the difference between you and me

(Hook)
I’m trying to make millions and millions and millions
I’m trying to make millions and millions and millions
I’m trying to make millions and millions and millions
I'm trying to make millions and millions and millions
I'm trying to make millions and millions and millions
I'm trying to make!

(2nd Verse)
You could catch me in the back screaming, "Change the station!"
I got less patience than doctor patients
Too many hoes in the reception room
I'ma play your bitch in order like math operations
Strictly emergency
Pulled it out, cause she started bleeding burgundy
Sorry girl but I’m a germ-a-freak
Im’a wipe my memory. Well chill next week
Sike! I'm gone for good
Yea I know its big mami. Get off my wood
You thinking you can, you wish you could
Only chasing one thing. Got it understood?

(Hook)
I’m trying to make millions and millions and millions
I’m trying to make millions and millions and millions
I’m trying to make millions and millions and millions
I'm trying to make millions and millions and millions
I'm trying to make millions and millions and millions
I'm trying to make!
