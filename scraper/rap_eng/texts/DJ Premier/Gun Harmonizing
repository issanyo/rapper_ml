[Intro]
Somebody lift me up, yeah
And give me a hand
Give me a ride, I'm sliding off the highway
There's a curve in the road
I don't know when I'm going, crazy

[Chorus: Royce Da 5'9" vocal gun sounds]

[Verse 1: Royce Da 5'9"]
Verbalizing my theme murder
Communicating while you debating using machine squirters
Br-r-rat, that trigger's my tongue, I l-l-lick a nigga
That fo'-fifth'll,lift a nigga whole clique up
The Lord call for your soul, it's time to go, pick up
Answer the horn, it's blowing at you, you cold, stiff up
My heat, heating my whole hip up, all we do is court strippers
Your metal freezing like it's a morgue zipper
I, ride around with Preem
Not the Preem from Queens, but the Preem from "DWYCK"
'Bout to change the game, 'bout to fly the desert
Eagle for y'all people, like the wing's the clip
And the barrel's the beak, my apparel is fleece
I'm adorned in diamonds, I'm a pharaoh deceased
Like if Spawn was rhymin, and I would advise you
Not to tempt her, New Temptations, the gun harmonizing

[Chorus: Royce Da 5'9" vocal gun sounds]

[Verse 2: Royce Da 5'9"]
Every bullet's a note, I write with a firing pen
Every time that trigger pull, it's a quote
Inside a booth fulla smoke, sniffin lines of that gunpowder
I'm hotter than a pair of boots and a coat
And a turtleneck, the best rapper alive
Could be the best rapper that died, I'm murderous
If you ain't get it by now, I'm suicidal, I'm wild
A nigga better than me, is who I ain't heard of yet
So I ain't murdered yet, he ain't even been born
His momma's a virgin, she ain't even fertile yet
Prepare to get back, next time you take a shit, stand and turn around and look in the toilet, then compare me to THAT!
Don't compare me to none of these muhfuckin' wannabe hustlers
Tough until they standing in front of me duckin'
It's off with yo' head nigga, 'less you one of them Dodgers
We sound off as one, we gun harmonize!

[Chorus: Royce Da 5'9" vocal gun sounds]

[Verse 3: Crooked I]
This shit is musical, my spit is beautiful
And if the best rapper died we'd be sitting at Nickel's funeral
But we ain't dying cause our trigger finger nail you
As quick as you clip a cuticle, hollows'll hit your follicles
I split your wig from far away like a long arm barber
Then lift your weight like a strong arm robber
Put that on Moses, I rely on my rod
As sure as Satan's tongue lying to God, everybody dying
It's like you standing in a circular firing squad
Singers for hire, I find him a job
You see the gauge baritone, the revolver's a tenor
Way the shots spin your body, I'ma call 'em "The Spinners"
Call 'em "Earth, Wind and Fire", put you beneath the earth, wind and fire
Feel the fire that burnt Richard Pryor
I'm keeping two guns, I named 'em Romeo and Juliet
Make you take five like you and your homies on the movie set
BLAOW!

[Chorus: Royce Da 5'9" vocal gun sounds]
