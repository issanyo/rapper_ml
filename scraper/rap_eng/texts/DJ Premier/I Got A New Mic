[Intro: Lupe Fiasco]
Just testing my new lil mic that I got
You know what I'm sayin?
Got this new mic from Guitar Center
So I'm just gonna bless it one time, put a little verses on it
You know what I'm sayin?
Uhh Ramadan Mubarak to everybody out there fasting, you know what I'm sayin?
This just a lil something, it's safe (feel me)

[Verse 1: Lupe Fiasco]
Sights and sounds write em down like football plays
Chang sun gang ton, how took ya'll ways
Far from rap, might as well write a book on stage
Carbon that, ID's cuz I look off age
Enemies, energies, tight shook off sage
Some of these symphonies, life took all days
Where the popos white as ghost clothes
It ain't good always where Jane Goodall stays
Coolest little black kid, livin' in the ghetto
Hmm, feelin' like livin' in Soweto
In the 80s, apartheid babies
Another dark side hope the hard drive saves me
Been diggin' in the archives lately
Reminiscing of a car ride, ain't he?
Collective plot, how I connect the dots
Like I'm making pepperoni pizza, for the seekers
Leap of faith, it's zabiha
It's okay, you can eat it with your mates
How Sway? You ain't got the answers
Like Sarah Huckabee Sanders. (Sway, Sway, Sway)

[Outro: Lupe Fiasco]
Ahh man, that's good right there, that's a good mic
Oh we gonna have a nice, nice lil' career together, me and you lil microphone
You know what I'm talking about? (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
