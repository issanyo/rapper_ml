[Intro]
Uh, just a quick one before class
(Zero to a hundred)
Ya know
(Real quick)
Rob A
Uh

[Verse]
This is hip-hop
Who am I? Bitch, it's Rob
5'10", but my rhymes are 6'5
My cynical rhymes put me on Criminal Minds, I stitch eyes
And sew Os
And why? See
My vocals a blow to the nuts, XYZ (Whoo)
Fantasize with your nasty mind but you'll never castrize me (Nah)
Castrate
At this fast rate I'll never be in last place
You're never gonna pass me
I'm light years ahead (Uh)
You can be Woody, I'd rather be Buzz Lightyear instead (Ya know)
So even when I fall off it's with style
Get your dogs called off, I'm a Rottweiler (Grrrrrr)
Don't mess with the kid who's on top NOT cause of the curve (Yikes)
You need to change who you mess with
But with me, the only change is progression
And I ain't looking for your change, fuck your cents, Man (Cha-ching)
I aim to give you my two
While spitting twenty-two twos
Like Jay when I was just two (Woo!)
And if you still don't feel it, than fuck you (Ha!)
Online you say you run shit, but you're only one shoe (Uh)
I'm a new pair of J's and some old school Adidas
You better run when I read your DMs, see ya (It's like that!)
Your credibility
Is now dead anonymity
Name a better kid than me
Uh, Rob A
