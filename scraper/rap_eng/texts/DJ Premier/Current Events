[Verse One]
Niggas ain't ready to ride no more
They used to try to keep it real, now they don't even try no more
They don't represent the 'Stuy no more
Ever since Big died, nobody Ready To Die no more
They don't get murdered when they testify no more
They just tell the whole truth, they don't lie no more
They don't sell real lah no more
When you smoke the same weed it don't even get you high no more
They ain't loyal to they connect, not no more
They just cop one time and they don't buy no more
Can't listen to music when you drive no more
Cause they don't make thinking music for the mind no more
50 Cent ain't got beef with Ja no more
Jay-Z ain't got beef with Nas no more
Too friendly, ain't no competitive side no more
Rap game boring, it ain't even live no more

"Here it is, step into my biz
With the free flow steelo, head crack like ceelo"
"I'm a winner, spit heavy rotation for the gangsta nation
Got no time for wankstas"

[Verse Two]
I said I'm better than Jigga cause I'm better than Jigga
I ain't no rookie to this shit, I'm a veteran spitter
I grew up with jooks men, good fellas and killers
My homies catch a case, man I send letters to niggas
I ain't hating, but I ain't get no bread with them niggas
I feel like it should've been me instead of them niggas
I wish the doctors and paramedics was quicker
Cause I'm sick with this shit, I need my medicine nigga
Niggas talking indirect, I step to them niggas
I wouldn't give a motherfuck if it was ten of them niggas
Head crack six niggas, I'm on a six man spree
Your girl think you a gangsta, I think that bitch can't see
Niggas say they gon' hit me, your whole clique fear me
I get your hit man hit up, they call me "Hit Man P"
You the best in the city, I'm screaming "This can't be."
You ain't no fucking gorilla, you just a chimpanzee

[Scratch Hook]

[Verse Three]
I'm a philosopher, popular for just popping impostors up
Rising like the mercury inside a thermometer
You say you off the meter, they lied to ya
I'm a thousand more times off the meter like a fucking kilometer
I'm not a big enough star? What are you astronomers?
Swallow a hollow cause you ain't promised tomorrow bro
Bloggers and bothers, Twitter following followers
I'm cocking a chopper to pop shots like photographers
My third eye focusing like I watch with binoculars
Drug money in my sneakers, foam posit depositer
The coppers be watching but I ain't stopping, I'm tired of ya
Middle finger to camera while they watching the monitors
Smoke ganja from Florida when I roll a blunt I hold a blunt
To my mouth like the player hold a harmonica
Can't stop the drama there ain't no hiding bro
I Barack Obama/Osama Bin Laden ya
