[Verse One: Seven]
Listen
Everyone's bothering, cause everyone bothers me
Everyone's digging me, and everyone's calling me
Everyone's chasing me, everyone's racing with me
I just wanna stay away and stop that wasting me, yeah

[Hook: Seven]
I don't wanna be the one, I don't wanna be your son
I just wanna surf the notes and all I want is my life go slow
I don't wanna be the one, I don't wanna be your son
I just wanna surf the notes and all I want is my life go slow

My life go slow, my life go slow
All I want is my life to go slow

[Verse Two: Seven]
I sit between trees and beach, the world is like melting cheese
I wish everything could freeze just one day all alone with me in peace
I realize, I start to hide
Reaction spills, and I trance inside
It's a task not to wear a mask and make you believe everyday
That everyday is just a blast

[Hook]

[Verse Three: Talib Kweli]
Livin' in the fast lane, gotta have game
Most of these lames stay Greene like my last name
They filled with envy and they lack experience
Shady, and they act mysterious
Baby, why you act so serious?
Here's a fun fact
You wanna go clubbin', but I've been there, done that
Maybe if they pay me
Maybe if you bring your whole crew along for the ride
And they all ladies
Otherwise we're just chillin' at the crib, maybe skillin' up a spliff
Maybe chillin' with the kids, two-willin' on the strip
Spittin' to the beat, while I'm buildin' like a brig
Sippin' on a fifth, while I kill 'em with the heat
The thrill of victory, the agony of defeat
I can never see why they don't slow down when life hit the curb
Chill out like you just hit the herb, word

[Hook]

My life go slow
All I want is my life to go slow

My life go slow
All I want is my life to go slow
