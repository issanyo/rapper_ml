[Verse]

I don't give a fuck who is on the throne with their feet up having honour shown
So you can keep Your Honour, thrown
Because I pen like an assassin aiming at a Martin Luther standing on the balcony
So when I write rhymes I'll kill a King

The both of us have a dream
You pose for the magazine covers, chosen for fashion, seen with these heaux, you're a fashion queen
My approach is No Vaseline, so having my name on a bullet is the only way I wanna be in a magazine

I'm a penile, little senile, fickle, thee child still in denial about the loss of a loved one
But, you see I'll still kidnap a blade runner behind bars just so I can put Oscar on a cricket pitch and tell Morn√© Morkel, "aim for the stumps"

I'll sniff a line, take sips of lime
This spliff 'til I'm so lifted I'm convinced that I'm in a time where Reason gets listed diamond
Rappers can all get fisted rhyming with two syllables
Listen, I'm indifferent
I'm insistent, priming, twisted, diamond in the rough
