[Intro]
“Fuck who did I offend, rappers”
“Sit back, I’m about to begin”

[Verse 1]
Didn’t wanna say this shit, but this shit is passed due
You’re judging me by my past not knowin’ that I’ve passed you
I see you lurkin’ at night
I see you worshippin’ I
I see these kids lookin’ up to pricks so here’s a word of advice:
The same ones that had to see you win to believe in you
Are the same ones, that in a split second, be leavin’ you
For some fool who was misplaced inside of this fixed game
No shit stains, but these rappers wantin’ bar fights already shit faced
Constantly talkin’ ‘bout others, why you so scared of yourself?
Constantly talkin’ ‘bout me, why you keep comparin’ yourself?
Aware it won’t help, but yet, you still tryin’
How you dead, and still dyin’?
I’m still fightin’ these lies, despite the violence they try to ignite to feel frightened
Oh, shit!
I’m always right, you woulda’ thought I had arthritis, and I’m still writin’
Depsising these rappers
Only time I diss guys is when I’m un-disguising these rappers
Flow holy with these verses, I’m baptizing these rappers
I don’t rationalize ‘cause those are just irrational lies
All these rappers slackin’ like some pants with no tag on the side, they worthless
All these rappers lackin’
I got some baggage so I convey what’s felt like a conveyer belt that’s amassin’ fashion, mothafucka’

[Chorus: (Sampled) Big L “Enemy”]
“Why do I end up in so much shit?
I done came way too far to be callin’ it quits
Jake wanna lock me up, even though I’m legit
They can’t stand seeing a young brother’ pockets get thick”

[Verse 2]
I don’t know which one’s worse:
Not knowin’ who will last, or not knowin’ who’s gon’ go first
Mothafucka’s suckin’ dick just so they can blow first
Nose diving in lies just to see who’s really gon’ float first
But I’m still at the standard that you can’t meet
So, how can you beat me with bars when I’m the bar that you can’t reach?
I can go from standin’ in the stands to takin’ a stand without a planned speech
Rappers talkin’ ‘bout class when they can’t teach
Rappers talkin’ ‘bout violent acts, but run away when they see a massacre like they can’t preach
I feel like I might need some credit like transactions
Feel like I bleed just so it can be said that I’m weak in actions
Y’all need to change it up, I can read your tactics
Speakers blastin’, I mean really, boy?
You a silly boy
Escalatin’ situations, you ain’t even on my level yet
If I’m better, then tell me, what are we settlin’?
I’m never irrelevant, so don’t say that I be speakin’ too soon
I’m so ahead of your response, I’m already readin’ your tomb, mothafucka’
(Gun Shot Soundbite)

[Chorus: (Sampled) Big L “Enemy”]
“Why do I end up in so much shit?
I done came way too far to be callin’ it quits
Jake wanna lock me up, even though I’m legit
They can’t stand seeing a young brother’ pockets get thick”
