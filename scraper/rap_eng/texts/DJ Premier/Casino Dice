[Hook x4]
“Pacino life, G a roll, casino dice”
“Ain’t nothin’ move but the money”

[Verse 1]
Murders of whole squads, put a toll on my life
They say your life can fade with the roll of the dice
So I moved out to Vegas to get my next paycheck
So I can run free and make bets, being as cold as this ice
I walked in, fat stacks, in a couple suitcases
And a bunch of assholes suckin’ up, “I was hoping you’d make it”
Cool, but listen up, I’m gonna run this place my way
So either shut the fuck up or you're hitting the highway
“No one’s going to interfere you running this place
Just as long as you stay incognito and not go gunnin’ for Jakes"
So it's me and DJ Premo in this palace paradise
Making C-Notes of suckers with malice while they roll the dice
I be the head honcho, he be the floor manager
Lookin' for cheaters, eagle eye spotted before cameras
Take them out back, how long you figure til' they buckle?
Prolly five seconds before I break all of they knuckles

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
People assuming that business is boomin'
Truly people need to think before bringing the doom in
Bad luck I guess, life be a succubus
Police found mob ties and now they be shutting us
Me and Premo burned anything that linked us to it
No way in hell that we were going to face the music
On the upside, a lot of millions each
We shook hands, said goodbyes now I'm flying back to the east
Everything died down by now, it's best to go to sleep
It'll take some hours before the bank will transfer the C's
I miss home, I miss the dirty streets
I miss the feeling of every motherfucker trying to murder me
I miss having to go under emergency surgery
I miss having to bribe the cops to make sure nobody heard of me
I miss scrambling out brains to look like a can of beans
Last bar of the song, take notes, I miss my family
