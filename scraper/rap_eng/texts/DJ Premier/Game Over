[Verse 1: Smooth B)

What seperates me from the rest of these so called MCs
Their rhymes dont flow like Smooth B's
A fortified rhymer with vitamins and minerals
Flow for the common folk, flow for the criminals
For the fans, womans and inbetween
???? much like a Hip hop fiend
Call me the glimmer man
I rock mink, ch-ch-chinchilla, Timberland
Y'all be looking for me, well here I am
The ego killer, I make a millionaire feel like he ain't got no credit
Picture me falling off, please nigga forget it
Don't call a hater a hater
Call him lotion, they always waiting to get put on with no devotion
Real niggas do real things
And fly bitches, fall for Smooth B like puppets with Dutch strings
Paid In Full like Azie, Alpo
And Rich Porter, next quarter, watch some careers get shorter
Game Over

[Verse 2: Smooth B]

I dont just spit on the mic, I throw up
And when I'm finished, I blow up
When it comes to writing poetry, I show off
Like Bismarck, I go off, I go off
Most competitive, most compatible, equilateral
The way I break it down on the beats, its mathematical
Real players eat lobster shrimp
When I pop my collar -  I look like a pimp
In Harlem like Dan I'm dapper
The rappest rapper
I go to Hot Pock for rice and beans and red snapper
When I'm fed up, foes fear me, I get fiery
I'm not a bad boy, but I bust off like Mike Lowrey
Dropped seven hits for seven summers before Diddy
Ask Diddy, who the real prince of the city?
Emperor like Hirohito, you small like a mosquito
I'm fillest to fall like ???ito
Italians say magnifico
Bad bitches say, are you from New York or Puerto Rico
From the Bronx, I was raised doing that ???? burrito
The man standing next to the man like I was Chico
Give me baked chicken and ???? ???? with ???? fritos
Don't make me pull out a can of whoop ass
I never go broke, I just run out of cash
And when that happens, I pull out my plastic
And if you owe me money, that shit can get drastic
Cuz' frankly I don't give a damn, like Clark Gable
I got my own style, my own money, my own label
Rap Tzar
