[Hook: Pusha T & Malice]
R-E-U-P-G-A-N-G, one plus three, the four we be
White to beige
Shit we lost them souls the Lord save
Monopolize these corners we own 'em like board games

[Verse 1: Ab-Liva]
It's  the allure of the grime
Nigga I love crime
Bentley Arnage with the cuts well [?]
When you ain't got shit, fuck the world
You got chips, you can fuck the next man's girl
Harsh, but they been ripped apart my world
So I shall cook crack, so I hurl
Three quarter lamb skin nigga, so I Shearl
Up on them five-spoke chrome things, so I hurl
Haters they earl, they nauseous
Lookin' like I'm god sent
Cream accents over that pearl white parchment
Interior blindin', floor mats ostrich
Scream havoc and [?] it's a constant (nigga)
I'm that knot that you flash when you buyin' the bar
I'm the pistol when niggas run for they car
I'm the bullet that travel through the barrel
Pierce you like an arrow
See your soul, flyin' with the sparrows

[Verse 2: Pusha T]
Been hearin' all the lies about your tires
Chrome rims and wires
And all them neighborhoods you supplyin'
Tryna get the OG to buy it
I was out Cancun vacationin', tryna get inspired
Second time around, they say the third's the charm
But listen, we the Re-Up Gang, we ain't the norm
Four rap niggas with a dope dealer swagger
But can you call it swagger if you still really bag up?
I think not, the glass stove with the gray pot
Mason jar, quarter contents of the Ziplocks
Small-minded niggas think I'm readying the rock
But in reality, I'm just cookin' a drop top
Or gettin' my wrist right, or makin' my neck heavy
Or keepin' my bitch tight, she love steppin' in Giuseppes
So now they flashes, the 600 hashes
Twiddlin' our thumbs on that La-Di-Da shit

[Verse 3: Sandman]
Swervin' with my pinky, on my lap's the steel
Mac-10 matchin' the carriage whippin' the wheel
All my diamonds resembling 'Cris
Hypnotizing ya bitch, you yellow-bellied in piss
Them Pelle Pelles I switch
I'm more butter than in what I pitch
Hoes love it, I smut 'em quick
Make 'em nut till they sick
Let 'em wipe off my dick before my [?]
Then I rub 'em on they belly 'cuz they shit beat up
Ya dig?
That's how I do you niggas bitches every day
Movin' [?] shittin' on you in every way
Come from a [?], told 'em my Glock waitin' to pop (blaow)
You playin' gorilla, then you ready to die
I'ma still shine on, big yellow bell
More squares than an ear of corn
Fuck tattoos, I make real tears form
Blood pools through when that HK drawn
Shots splatter the block now they they drawn
SWATs run on the block but they they gone

[Verse 4: Malice]
Ya'll niggas rhyme? You're lyin' to me
Get a good look what you aspirin' to be
I see you got drive, consign him a key
Whoever got flow, then you sign him to Re
-Up Gang niggas, sold a million plus
And still I'm in the kitchen like I'm Wolfgang Puck
Damn shame, ain't it? Yeah, my love's tainted
For the game, so forgive me if I seem a bit jaded
I ain't up on the latest in hip hop news
I'm more concerned with my tick-tock shoes
Don't get it confused, we here to take aim
It's the tale of two brothers like Frank and Jesse James
Ab play the role of the Sundance kid
Fuckin' with the Re-Up, you might not live
And Sand's Butch Cassidy, finger on the trig
Ya'll niggas stand for [?], like them bitches from the [?]
