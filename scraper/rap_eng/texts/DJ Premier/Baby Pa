[Lil Dap]
Uh, check it out...
Walkin' through the ghetto and the feelin' is fine
Relaxation, no frustration 'cause it's time to get live
One hand washes the other in these lonely streets
No justice, no peace and motherfuckers won't eat
So we struggle and strive niggas just to stay alive
I sense fear in these pussy rappers rhymin' okay
Yo, we speak what we feel, and what we feel must be real
Baby Pa, you know the deal...
