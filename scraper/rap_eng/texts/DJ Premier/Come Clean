[06. Jeru The Damaja - Come Clean]
TUTORIAL LA MIXTAPE

[Verso 1]
You wanna front—what? Jump up and get bucked
If you're feeling lucky duck then press your luck
I snatch fake-gangster emcees and make ’em faggot flambé
Your nine spray, my mind spray
Malignant mist that'll leave comp defunct
The result's your remains stuffed in a car trunk
You couldn’t come to the jungles of the East popping that yang
You won't survive get live catching wreck is our thing
I don't gang bang or shoot out bang bang
The relentless lyrics the only dope I slang
(I'm a true master, you can check my credentials) (x4)
'Cause I choose to use my infinite potential
Got a freaky, freaky, freaky freaky flow
Control the mic like Fidel Castro locked Cuba
So deep that you can't scuba dive
My jive's origin is unknown like the Jubas
I've accumulated honeys all across the map
’Cause I’d rather bust a nut than bust a cap
In your back in fact my rap snaps your sacroilliac
I'm the mack so I don’t need to tote a Mac
My attack is purely mental and it's nature's not hate
It's meant to wake ya up out of your brainwashed state
Stagnate nonsense, for if you persist
You’ll get your snotbox bust you press up on this
I flip, hoes dip, none of the real niggas skip
You don't know enough math to count the mics that I've ripped
Peep the Dirty Rotten scamp as his verbal weapons spit

[Hook sampleado] (x5)
Uh-oh! Heads up 'cause we're dropping some shit!

[Verso 2]
Real, rough and rugged, shine like a gold nugget
Every time I pick up the microphone I drug it
Unplug it on chumps with the gangster babble
Leave your nines at home and bring your skills to the battle
