[Verse 1: Bigs Gavino]
Why SoundCloud, why?
What are you doing?
What are your developers, high?
Ah, let me check my inbox
Let's see whats this, knock knock knock
Smelled better service from a dirty gym sock
Copyright this, and copyright that
Why did I say that, I'm not cat in the hat
I'm literally copying Landy's ideas
This is hard to do like furniture from Ikea
Biggie Smalls is the illest
Kill me please I wanna be the killed-est
No flow like SoFlo Antonio
Row row row your boat call me plutonium
That was me finding rhymes with Antonio
What on Earth is plutonium
Hi, my name is what
My name is who
My name is not Slim Shady
Your mom gay
Understandable
Have a day
I didn't specify what kind of day
I don't force moods on people, okay?

[Chorus - NeutralStar]
One, two, three and to the four
I beat my meat then kick in the door
One, two, three and to the four
I beat my meat then kick in the door
One, two, three and to the four
I beat my meat then kick in the door
One, two, three and to the four
I beat my meat then kick in the door

[Verse 2 - Vector The Shitposter]
Welcome to the Nutshack, you silly motherfucker
You think I'm actually a rapper, god you're a sucker (yo)
Load my rifle, pack a snack
Sorry son, but you about to get capped
Break your door, right down, I'mma make you take a nap
The infinite universe, full of possibilities
Unfortunately, It's filled with uncivil hostilities
Jesus christ, look at the time
I guess it's time to bust some rhymes
If I don't, I serve a dime
Rotting in a cell for wav crimes
I check my youtube, looks fine
But soon shit is gonna turn awry
A bunch of suckers wanna die
I listened to their requests, and I oblige
Hey, you wanna fight? Aye!
If you say so, stand by
Fuck the rules, those are for fools
I pull out my pistol and say "Bye"
God, I'm tired of this shit
References to death and forced wit
Making Biggie look like a total twit
Destroying the whole song
Lickety split
Star will probably
Throw a fit
I will probably
Lose it
They're the soundclown drillbits
We're the misfits (yo)
This idea wasn't stolen
If anything, it's fucking golden
If anybody asks, we'll just say it's trolling (slant rhyme)
These verses aren't stolen
What the hell are you talking about?
Your need to spout bullshit makes you sound like a girl scout
Aww, you need a feel to shout?
Sorry that I called you out
That's what happens when you have a pussy
You stay down for the count

(What? I can't say pussy? Is that offense? Yeah, sorry, here's the chorus.)

[Chorus - Vector the Shitposter]
One, two, three and to the four
I beat my meat then kick in the door
One, two, three and to the four
I beat my meat then kick in the door
One, two, three and to the four
I beat my meat then kick in the door
One, two, three and to the four
I beat my meat then kick in the door
