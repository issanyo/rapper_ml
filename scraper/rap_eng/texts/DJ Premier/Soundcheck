[Intro]
Yeah man, turn that up
My vocals is mad loud
Should I turn this thing down?
We gon' get the mics right in this bitch
C'mon man, get the monitor straight right here
Two two, yeah, yeah
I'm feeling that right here
This one's good
Get them levels popping, P
You know what I'm saying?
The song's going to be bananas tonight, man, for real

[Verse]
Cock the hammer, shoot first mentality
And you're a fantasy to us, a reality
When it comes to the streets, I am the innovator
While you're sitting down at Wendy's eating a baconator
I keep my rhymes cool up in the refrigerator
While you rock them baby rhymes spit from the incubator
My kicks is flavored up like the Now and Laters
And I'll smash your think ass skull like it's a soft tomato
You got a switch in your walk like you's a hot potato
And I'm serving hot lead like I'm the gangster waiter
Twice as smart as you, I'm the great debater
While I spit it from the streets, you's a perpetrator
You way lesser than me, you know that I am greater
Plus you gay as hell trying to act straighter
I'm loving my life while you remain a hater
You's a weak-hearted cat, need a defibrillator
Preem take it way, slap the crossfader
While I show these motherfuckers exactly what I'm made of
With the mind of a pimp, beef like a gladiator
I bring life up to this game like a human resuscitator
Hit you and taser ya, then I rob you for your glaciers
Now you're singing to the cops like Julio Iglesias
Cut up your body, scatter it in different places
Now it's off to Aruba spending your big faces
You need some gangster shit, give me a call
And I'll attack them all like a caged animal
Tomb raider, while you remain an agitator
Yo Sing, get the bags, let's meet up in Jamaica
Uh huh, uh huh

[Outro]
Yeah, yeah
These mic is straight right here, P
Just make sure when we come back to do the show
Everything is like this
You know what I'm saying?
Soundcheck is done, man
I hope they got some good food in the dressing room
I'm out of here
Big Shug
Aha
