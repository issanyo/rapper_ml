[verse: Napoleon Da Legend]
Nixon got impeached, I’m sipping white tea with peach
You might have the features but don’t have the reach
I’m bout to pull receipts pull up a seat
Full press release listening to y’all is like pulling teeth
I only speak when the stakes peak
The crowds migrate from main stage to see me rock stage B
Cannot replace me I’m once in a lifetime
When you hearing one project, I got 10 in the pipeline
This ain’t a grind for lazy, my passport crazy
I’m a tad like Scorsese and my raps more wavy
Promoters gotta assign a whole task force to pay me
Fast forward to the future I’m the black warren Beatty
Slack never stack cheddar for the bad weather
Take it max like Etta James on wax
This is ya brain on crack no designer drug shit
Tie em up you had ya moment now ya time is up kid

[verse: Napoleon Da Legend]
Ya mans about the action that hand to hand transaction
Aim a gun behind my back and shoot a backstabber
Leave em with a bad status let em carry that baggage
I’m a maverick if there’s a challenge I’ll take a stab at it
My rap matters like the lives of black men
Don’t try to act like you ain’t racist cause you have a black friend
Kyrie Irving back spin my curve game is exceptional
Perfection is a given anything less unacceptable
Pep talk for hustlers we just export to customers
We next door plotting just to extort the government
Buju Ton-Ban That’s Jovi Bon don
Eating Bonchon word is bond bong
Hit it then I’m gone, the soul of Guru is alive and it’ll never die
Connecting the dots like in Akhenaton mind
Belafonte scripted with a better font
Cats chop it up like the back of chinese restaurants
