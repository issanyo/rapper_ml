Let's go
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Big Big Shug, Big Big Shug

(And this is the way, the way)
The way it is
(And this is the way, the way)
The way it is

[Big Shug]
I'm not the, Lord of the Rings, I'm the lord of poppin them things
Settin you up, and takin your bling
Hoes love the way I spit it though
Cause of the Speakerboxxx they give me Love Below
I'm from Murderpan where they raise no snitches
But some cats still do, I navigate
Nicely around them cats, you snitch on me
They find your ass out back
Bein' chewed on by the pigeons and the rats
Hollow your body, and that's a fact black
Fo' sure
You not an MC, you'se a rapper
Fashion yourself, after Hollywood actors
I ain't hatin' on your progression though
Cause for two years now your skills have been in recession yo
No aggression, no passion, no heart
That's when shit, starts to fall apart
More money, more security
Out of touch nigga you can't even feel me
Deadbeat nigga owe money to your kids
That's just the way it is, the way it is

[Hook]
(And this is the way, the way)
The way it is
(Now I'm back with the flyest material)
(And this is the way, the way)
The way it is
(I got plans for this rap game)
(And this is the way, the way)
The way it is
(The look in my eye punk, has got you scared of me)
(And this is the way, the way)
The way it is
The way it is

[Big Shug]
Lil' mane, playin' the blame game
Can't take the weight, blame it on your mayne
Sound like a bitch, a-gain in the game
When shit's goin' smooth you go against the grain
Fake cuckoo, like you goin' insane
But won't hold a gun to your motherfuckin' brain
You used to be so right, you used to be so tight
Now I wanna knock out your fuckin' lights
Fright night nigga, scared of your own shadow
You, you, yes you, you wanna battle
I'll eat your ass up and stuff you in a barrel
Crush up your bones and feed the pits the marrow
Serious biz, I got out for the scriz
That's just the way it is, the way it is

(And this is the way, the way, the way)

[Hook]
