30 hour round trip Philly to Florida
Driving In the snow just to get where it’s warmer
The way I’m coming off of the record like a reporter
Law and order I've never been kinda sorta

I was more the; latter than the former
I’m a make a quarter million dollars out a quarter
For my son and my daughter you won’t catch me cutting corners
Toyota I’m moving forward
I bought a house by the water
To meditate at the harbor; at sunset
Letting my mind wander
I realign all the chakras
Black author yeah I'm sharper than fine tip marker
I know it’s harder to get ya lines up like a barber
If I'm smarter than I will go farther

Harder

GoVanGoes go grab another zippo
I just put my Jordans on I got to tiptoe
GoVanGoes I know you get the memo
You was playing games; I was designing the demo
Your wife in my limo; your relationship in limbo
When I hit my tempo; you stuck in your friend zone
Smoke blows out the window, then I gotta get low
Copy that like 10-4; Copy that like Ditto
When I'm in the studio; I be on my DIPLO
Ten Toes Yeah you know I'm on my Shit YO
Yeah I'm on my Shinto
Pack my luggage but don't trip
Fuck you mean I just hit a bean in a pinto
No competition; No Fucking pot to piss in;
NoteBooks, Hallways, and Stop and Listen
