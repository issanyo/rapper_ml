[Chorus]
“Rockin’ with the best”

[Verse]
Uh, oh no y’all didn’t
Call me out like I’m the one y’all did it
I’m the one who will come through this here off ri-ip
And rip the wind off you as quick as I ran off with it
Uh, man down if he ain’t authentic
I’m like, no y’all didn’t
I’m the best when comes to killing the so called illest
I’m the pinnacle, no one identical to me
I’m spinning on you, I pick and roll like I been to the movies
I been in more pressure than you been in before
Close calls where I lost, blowouts where I won
I been in more situations which has made me what I am today
I’m too unstoppable not to look at you as if you’re crazy
If you get in my way like “oh no y’all didn’t”
Impossible’s nothing, I know y’all feel this
