[Hook]
Ayo, I'm gonna be on ti-dop, that's all my eyes can see
Victory is mine, yeah, surprisingly
I've been laying, waiting for your next mistake
I put in work and watch my status escalate

[Napoleon Da Legend verse]
5:24 the world belongs to early risers
My circle solid, u can be the first to cop it
They see it popping then they flip and commercialize it
None of these nerds can knock it this ain’t for the bloggers
This ain’t for profit this for bragging rights
Maybe a bag rice still it might make the algorithm spike
This is flour white powder organic spice
I plan it right like Dana White, I don’t pay for likes
I don’t ask for favors twice, one man gang
Hit it up on Bandcamp name ya price
The original no duplicates
Budapest movers we colluded with
Salute kid this might be my new career
My life went thru the roof when I removed the fear
This mood is rare take a souvenir
This the cross I choose to bear
All you can eat I got food to share

[Hook]
Ayo, I'm gonna be on ti-dop, that's all my eyes can see
Victory is mine, yeah, surprisingly
I've been laying, waiting for your next mistake
I put in work and watch my status escalate
