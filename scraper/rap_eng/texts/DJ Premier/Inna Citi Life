"I excel...I excel then prevail" (Repeat 4X)

[Verse 1: Lil' Dap]
So much anger built inside
I'm a legend of my time, '95 is mine
And these punk-style niggas thinkin' that they are fly
Talk about the ghetto life but they don't know the hard times
I'm eatin' curry chicken and rice and these hoes look nice
Smoking lala with my niggas 'til the day turns night
Watchin' fiends hustle for schemes to fuck up their dreams
We watch their back, it's cool; you never know who's a fool
Real niggas know the rules, I pack a tool for these fools
Hop skip, you lose in this inner city blue
Check it out
Where my niggas at?
Where my niggas at?
Where my niggas at?

[Verse 2: Nutcracker]
Ayo, niggas I flip, and drugs I shift
I shoot a nigga in his face 'fore I shoot the gift
Check it
Swing the mic, living trife, do what you like
I hit your moms in the head with a metal pipe
Walk through the valley of death with no fear
And nuttin' suckas like a runaway deer
So step off, son, you just can't get none
No matter how strong they come, they get done
I grab my gun in the presence of danger
I'm real frustrated with so much anger
Express myself violently, that's how I think
So stand back, I'm hittin' harder than a fuckin' tank
I just cut my G's and keep steppin'
I'm gettin' respect but for the damage I be wreckin'
The Nutcracker and I have no pity
That's how it is for the kids in the inner city

"I excel...I excel then prevail" (Repeat 3X)

[Verse 3: Lil' Dap]
Lyric dissolve from your dome  before I break your brain
Ain't nothin' too insane, got them open like cocaine
Check it out party people as I speak with the lisp
People said we couldn't do it 'cause they can't feel it
Yo, the Group Home representer, low budget environment
Word is bond, shit is on, now let's all sing along
Check it out for my niggas that are R.I.P
Pourin' beer on the streets, think about your deceased
Nothing can be better, but the shit goes on
But that's life, ah, in the inna city

"I excel then prevail"

[Verse 4: Nutcracker]
I make you wanna jump, sike, I kill a fuckin' mic
I write the hype dope lyrics that you like
I stay low-key to myself and keep stepping
You wanna fight while I'm reaching for my murder weapon
A young nigga, I'm only eighteen
When my peoples had beef, I was always on the scene
I'm the Nutcracker and I do what I like
That's how we live in this Inna Citi Life

[Outro]
"Now now now let's get this straight
I am the star of this act"
"Don't nothin' scare a nigga, daddy, shit..."
"Niggas ain't scared of nothin'
Except not being able to get some pussy..."
"We real cool"
"Alright, we gonna try a new song..."
"Break it down like this..."
