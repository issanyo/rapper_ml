[Intro: L.I.F.E. Long and (Poison Pen)]
Uh huh.  Yes.  Live and direct from [?].  (Stronghold Number 1).  Uh huh.  Yes.  Live and direct from [?].  (L.I.F.E. Long).  Uh huh.  Yes.  Live and direct from [?] Studios.  (Harry Potter).  Peace to my man [?].  Ayyo, Stronghold, Strongheezy.  The Mixtape part two, y’all.  It’s like, “1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.  1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8”

[Verse 1: L.I.F.E. Long]
Stronghold, chosen ones this side of fiery hell
Walking through the future where devils dwell
Survival of the fittest, we overcome the weakness
Climbing through obstacles of the inner mind’s deepness
With street sense, conscious to this system’s nonsense
The attributes of my people recorded in documents
That be held in chambers at Schomburg Museum
Take the march uptown to the mausoleum
[?] Africa what I represent
Conquer your primitive land on top Pakistan elephants
Erase televised lies of Africans swinging on vines
Climb the highest mountain to obtain the Sun
What is now recorded has been precisely done
For one nation, spread the word for children to rise
With they thirds on the prize.  Use wisdom to uplift
Opening a blind man’s eyes, so explore the scene:
You in front the raw, rugged, kind-of-bugging scripts
Original, y’all admit it.  Tried to camouflage it, but I peeped y’all
Slipping on thin ice, then laugh when you fall
Got up like it was nothing, bluffing
Cats is fraudulent, built for the scuffing of grills
Getting rearranged like interior decorators decorating
Stronghold, we drop wax, start shutting down player-hating
Now non-believers on our side, giving props
Coming soon: L.I.F.E. Long trading cards endorsed by Topps
On your block, brewing up storms on tour
Get out your Gore-Tex ‘cause when it rains, it pours
Stronghold, much in store.  Continuous, flawless this year
Just like last year and the previous year
“Foundation,” rebuild it again.  Put it in the air
For the squad putting in the most work
Make y’all punks get your weight up, jerk
We berserk with a verse, make you black out
Knock you out before the bell, no doubts
We the unstoppable force everybody’s talking about
It ain’t hard to tell.  I rock well
And still excel.  Uh huh.  Energizing it like that
Putting Stronghold on the map
You know how we do
L.I.F.E. Long.  Stronghold be the crew

[Outro: L.I.F.E. Long]
Poison Pen.  Uh huh.  Stelf Index, L.I.F.E. Long, C-Rayz Walz, Breez Evahflowin’, DJ Static, Big Mike the Terror, my man Wiz.  Stronghold.  Guard the women and kids.  It’s like that.  Uh huh.  Yeah.  Uh huh
