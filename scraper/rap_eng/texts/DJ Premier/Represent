[Intro]
Yo, yo, yo, yo
First and foremost, man
I'ma tell the cops stop shutting down my motherfucking places
Wherever the fuck I go to party, motherfucker
Leave me the fuck alone, I'm peaceful

[Hook]
Represent, represent
Represent, represent
I can't even have a God damn drink anymore, nigga
Represent, represent
'Cause I ain't no hip-hop police, the gang squad [?]
Represent, represent

[Verse]
Straight up, shit is real
I'm laying back, hot box, change the channel
It's back in '93, Time Warner couldn't handle
Fuck a cable bill, rather have it fixed watching Spice
Fast forward to a decade later, gone and shooting dice
Project radiator, mom tried to cuff me to it twice
She always found my crack way before I picked the mic
Never dreamed that I'd be touring through the states
'Mind me of a surgeon, how I bypassed the hate
I'm looking for a pastor nowadays, I need to pray
Never sell my soul, don't matter what Satan pay
I'm a product of the money-makin' borough, Spanish Harlem
On my skin, every Harlem nigga shine, double up like a twin
Rub shoulders with the Underworld, forgive me for my sins
Lord, I need the money, even if I gotta swim
In a lake of fire, Hell, hoping Heaven let me in
Sometimes I wanna die so I can be born again

[Hook]
Represent, represent
Word
Represent, represent
Can I drink this Hennessy?
Represent, represent
Represent, represent
Yeah

[Outro]
This that NahRight, UpNorthTrips exclusive, 2014 shit
One time for your mind
Yo, Ohla, niggas keep on doubting me like I ain't the best, pa
It's not cool to be average, nigga
Line your favorite rappers up and watch Papi shut them niggas down
Word up, female rappers too
I don't give a fuck, boo, word
From ashin' to classics, still sending packages up north
The world is ours, Tanboys nation
