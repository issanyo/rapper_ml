[Intro: A.G.]
Uh
Yeah ya know what it is
Show & A.G
Bars in the Booth
Premier was here, huh
South Bronx baby
Diggin in the Crates for life

[Verse: A.G.]
King of the courtyard, call me A like report card
I give a fuck about these cameras like porn stars
You think I flew in to London
The way I throw heat like Heathrow
I'm in the hood on the Friday and I'm looking for Debo
So many bars got them screaming for the CO
I take a photo with my people
A thousand likes on the gram, that's a kilo
So serious, playing with the beat though
Usual suspect, skully with the petticoat
World premiere, I run the globe and ask Premo
You see me and you see Show
Flags up, got Vanguard with me
So crazy with the verses, my man moms hit me
Said nigga you the illest, I disagree not
Tag my name on her stain, I write on the spot
You lack class, you lack fame
You think you fly, have you missing like that plane
It's Red Apples, digging number four
One half of Show & A, I'm the A, I'm the raw, I'm the core
The nigga on the floor with your girl tryna score
It's like Wilt wearing slik nigga, huh
I'm the reason that see hates your style
You the reason she got a fake profile
And 'cause of me she feels liberated, huh
And 'cause of you she take her phone and incinerate it
Beast boy, nigga out the fed
Try to chill, now he back the fucking with Heavy D like Trouble T-Roy
I'm a hardcore b-boy
Looking for the truth, you a decoy, huh
Diggin' Entertainment, still drop bombs
