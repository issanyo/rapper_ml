FIRST VERSE
The streets couldn't wait to hear Fish over premier/
Im colder than peers and getting iller over the years/
And this flow right here a bring hova to tears/
Im watching the throne and gunning for who holding the chair yeah./
Nigga show said go, No holding back/
I got a star quality and ain't no molding that./
Plus i got the skills to make a rapper look foolish./
Far from new to this son i really do this./
I can tutor this, so holla if you need lessons./
They think they need weapons when they need direction./
When you coming from the hood its hard to see your blessings./
Behind eviction notice seeing moms stressing./
But im guessing everything got a silver lining/
So im grinding with this rhyming till its perfect timing./
Start climbimg and polished until a nigga shining./
Pressure from this cold world turned me to a diamond./ Fisher

Second verse
Now its all on G, told the team put it all on me./
Now these bitches all on me like they all on e./
They let the blind lead the blind, now they all gone see./
Promised all my niggas rich what we all gone b./
Jesus christ peace god asalaam alaikum./
They turned obama's nation to an abomination./
And nah i ain't up here preaching to the congregation./
But you need to go and read the emancipation proclamation./
This shit is deeper than rap./
Reminisce on the abyss but its deeper than that./
Im speaking the facts, eventhough i be heating the tracks./
I know its such a cold world and niggas eating with rats./
I need it now why die hopeing./
Smoke a lot of lah to keep my third eyes open./
Wise guy floating and i ain't italian./
But im bout to go and copp a malcome x medallion./

Third verse/ beat change

Now this shit right here is bout beats and rhymes./
You need to read between the lines just to see the signs./
Im a redefine what it is to be divine./
Read my mind, im surprised my life exceeded crime./
For the drop with the rims i threw rocks at the pen./
Bitches stay jocking cause im shopping again./
Now im trying get my city poppin  again./
Meanwhile the cops stop and try locking us in./
But if we came together ain't no stopping us then./
But instead of marching you rather play the block with your friends./
I was the same way in the trap playing gameday./
With the team and all we run is the same play./
Get high, get drunk, fuck a chick or two./
I can't lie i be doing what a nigga do./
Ima street nigga too so i ain't here to preach to ya./
But its a cold world im just trying bring some heat to ya./ Fisher
