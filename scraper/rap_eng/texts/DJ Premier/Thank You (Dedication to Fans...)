Since I felt like a prisoner of my dreams, yeah
It took such a long time
For me to realize just how to be
And to listen to me

Don't go thinking I'm not thankful
'Cause me, I've got my hands full of good things, ooh

You inspire me to keep on living
(So what you gotta say?)

So thank you for standing right by me (I will always love you)
So thank you for being behind me (you are just so amazing)
And watching me grow and lettin' others know
