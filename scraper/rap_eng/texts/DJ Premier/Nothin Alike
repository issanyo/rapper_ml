[Sample Scratch Intro]
You don’t know you better ask somebody
What, you think you like me? You ain’t like me

[Verse 1]
In a rap game full of fake niggas, I'ma stand out
Homey, we nothing alike. Don’t put ya hand out
Came up in a time when…they’da touch you for dimin'
Now it seems that we stuck in an environment
Where dudes turn puppets for diamonds, other than rhymin
Homey/you and I have nothing in common/nah
Swear it make me wanna demonstrate
How this fo-five set a fuckin demon straight
But i rather enlighten/but it’s so hard cuz all the
Trash yall be writin be lackin excitement
Fake jacks but wit a fraud you send syn-onymous
Ain’t no threats you send ominous/I’m in this
To let you all know: more than likely
He who act hard as a scram that be showin off for the cam
Talk like he spark it and blam…but when it’s
On he get tweet beef/I just mark it as spam

[HOOK]
You keep that rachet/you be clutchin it tight?
You put in that work/earned a couple a stripes
You only live that live when you clutchin the mic
What you rhyme ain’t your reality/we nothing alike
PREEM
[Sample Scratch] You don’t know you better ask somebody
What, you think you like me? You ain’t like me
Anyway

[Verse 2]
Never sell your soul/that remain the slo-gan
No matter what you attain/it’s just a slow gain
Y’all portray an image….that the label presented
Y’all say that it’s business/I say it’s a gimmick
They say that the minute you really live what they order you
To say like you meant it…then they’ll throw you away in a minute
You mean to tell homey if a fell-ony
Fell on me….they a flip and tell on me?
What I’m supposed to do?….when they want real and it’s
Only a few who…..can show it to you
The soul of Guru is flowin thru you
Carry that torch/that what they holdin you to
I long for longevity…..but if it
All wasn’t meant to be/it’s all good. I’ll let it be
Can’t be the one they say threw away all
Morals/integrity…all for celebrity

[HOOK]

[Verse 3]
Everybody’s a gangsta/till it’s time to be a
Gangsta/yall are so inconsistent
Front like y’all poppin off/when it’s time to
Pop em off/y’all all turn bitch in an instant
Everybody a thug/till the time come to thug
For real/pop off a slug and kill
You gambling wit ya life when you playin them games
Homeboy you better stay in ya lane (word up)
