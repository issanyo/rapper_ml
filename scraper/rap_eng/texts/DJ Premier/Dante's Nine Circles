"One two three four five six seven eight nine"
[TK]
It's Dante's nine circles
One!
Yo Tarun, Who you Feeling like
[T. Sun]
Dante
[TK]
Agreed
Let's get it

Been in the forest for years, climbed a hill and saw three animals
Leopard, lion, wolf. Made my legs run mechanical
A figure appeared moonlit, and he was sent
To take me to hell, famous poet named Virgil

[T.Sun]
Circle Numero Uno: This place is limbo
Virgil, Ovid, Plato, righteous folk
Lived before christianity quite literally
These poets are guiltless, they deserved heaven but got less

[TK]
Two: Cheat, that's the punishment for you
Guarded by Minos, heard a story that got me comatose
Told by Francesca
Plucked at my chest cuh
Hurricanes there bruh

[T.Sun]
Circle Three: Don't put too much in your body
The circle of much shame where it perpetually rains
And if the sin of gluttony you are found to blame
Until trumpet plays, you'll suffer in pain

[TK]
Circle Four: People move weights cause they hoard
Only take what you need
God really hates Greed

[T. Sun]
Circle Five: Wrathful fight and sullen lie
The condemned swim in styx but its not as bad as circle

[TK]
Six! City of Dis, with the Heretics
Seen a bad pope name Anastasius

[T.Sun]
Circle Seven: the ones too violent for Heaven
Murderers and tyrants scream loud or drown in silence
Limbs become twigs when suicide is the fix
Speak blasphemy, rain flame for all eternity

[TK]
Circle Eight: Where frauds stay; Malbolge
Each pouch is treacherous in its own way

[T.Sun]
Circle Nine: this circle is as cold as can be
First and second rings have traitors to my party
Rings 3 and 4 who made ill for their benefactor
And he was just sitting; All frostbitten

[TK]
Satan
Three-headed and as large as a mill
Each mouth chewing a traitor who couldn't be killed
First mouth had Judas, he betrayed the Holy Son
Cassius & Brutus
Killed Cesar, Rome was done
I followed Virgil, climbed Satan. We made our way up
We passed the southern hemisphere, it was a shakeup
Found a hidden road to make it to the top
We saw the stars after many bars but we couldn't stop
We climbed Satan's hair, we saw the sinners that were there
Felt bad for those people but I know my God is fair
Gotta go, Gotta go. Me and Virgil are headed for Paradisio


Sorry Biggie, I needed the A
