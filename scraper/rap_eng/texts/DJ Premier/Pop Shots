[Intro: DJ Premier (ODB samples)]
Rest in peace, Ol' Dirty
"See my name is the ODB"
"The-the-the-the-the Ol' Dirty Bastard"
"Wu-Tang, Wu-Tang, Wu-Tang, Wu-Tang"
"Roc-a-Fella, Roc-a-Fella, Roc-a-Fella, Roc-a-Fella"
"Wu-Tang, Wu-Tang"

[Hook 2X: Ol' Dirty Bastard w/ samples cut]
As I poppppppppppp, shotttttttttttttttttts
As I po-a-opppppppp, shotttttttttttttttttts

[Ol' Dirty Bastard]
'86 was the year that it started
Crack hit the states, and my hood got to poppin'
Back then, you had to catch it with narcotics
Without a doubt, Brooklyn had the hardest projects
Nowadays, if a nigga say you got it
You be sitting in the county, with like 3 or 4 charges
Young when started, but I had a talent
To get this package up, cuz I took it as a challenge
The older niggas game me much as I can handle
Cop the eagle, started jackin' with the green New Balance shit
I'm feelin' clean, I was only thirteen
With the heavy starch, on my Bugle Boy Jeans
My name's spelled right on my four finger ring
It was Dirt then, cuz McGirt you ain't seen

"The Ol' Dirty Bastard"
"Rollin...."

[Ol' Dirty Bastard]
Toe to toe, I scrap with the best
If I spit ten rhymes, nigga, nine gon' connect
If you ain't feelin' 1 or 2, I respect
Cuz I probably just forgot, and wrote it strictly for my set
Wu-Tang, man I love my set
Niggas comin' up here, this is where the G's at
Look here, more money, more problems, my ass
You'se a naive cat, if you still believe that, for real
That's a trick to try to keep you where you at
All content, while niggas ridin' Bentley's and Maybach
Think I'mma lay back, playa, forget it
First hundred G's, I see, nigga, I'm tryin' to flip it
And that's some real shit, not just a lyric
Drop a couple open cases, not too specific
Niggas out here tryin' to prove whose the realest
It's ok to pop shit, but come a little different

"Tell 'em who the fuck I be..."
"The ODB"
"Tell 'em who the fuck I be..."
"The-the-the Ol' Dirty Bastard"
