What u say when u drunk in the club (hood up)
And u deep in the club let me know
(hood up)
Show me where u from if ya city's #1
(hood up hood up hood up....)

Chingy

Lets ride
Then i drop the top
You know ching a ling gon' make it hot
Let's ride
Girl i got it locked
Shut the club down when i hit the spot

Ain't no secret im doin it baby
If i like what i see im pursuin it maybe
But a nasty attitude that could ruin it lady
If its all gravy hop in and (lets ride)
And we can cruise a lil bit
Wild out and act like fools a lil bit
My whip ain't old girl this that new shit

Twist that thing and wiggle it more
A couple big faces what u jiggle it for
Now close my door hold on

Strip tease yeah i know you will won't ya
Other chicks mad cuz chingy flaunt ya
And ya know i'm on ya
