[Intro Talking]
That's why we here, we got other things to do
But brothers and sisters, y'all better listen
And your God, that put you in this that put you in this
Is callin' now, He's telling you it's time
And they know it's time, they know it (know it, know it)

[Verse: Chingy]
Befo' I say this verse all praises to the most high (most high)
Sittin' on a throne, "Chingy the King" what I go by (Judah)
Jumped off the slave ship to a spaceship, boy I'm so fly (so fly)
Cut yo' triangle eye, with my shortminders, know I
You in the kitchen, cookin' up, trynna bake a pie
I'm readin' 'bout my past deception, trynna cremate a lie
Guess I should talk about, bottles, girls, the hood and guns
I've gotten sick of that you son of sin, I'm God's Son
Throw up yo' number ones, and rep that seven with me
New year for new light and new life where can’t no hater get me
And tell'em my machine, gotta do that for the cheese
And keep that swine, beef 'n shrimp, I don't want that slow disease
They sayin' nigga please, what you done got on?
I’m sayin brotha please, mad cause you ain't got on
I hope this here hit home, prolly not cause addictions
Satan in yo environment and I’ll be right here in my JUDAH-sdiction

[Hook: Chingy]
I can't deny it, I'm a straight rider
You don't wanna fuck with me (with me)
Got them gentiles bussin at me
But they can't do nothin' to a G

I’ve gotten sick of that you son of sin. I’m God’s son
When will we live as one, prolly not 'til the end
Agenda 21 just started, let the show begin
Fix you face up from this hate, there's FEMA camps in yo state
They must pray there's no debate, I president the debate
Wait (wait), hope you got what you wanted
Take yo' kids out they school systems, why? Cause their teacher's haunted
I know I'm gone be wanted, we gotta die for some
Now turn the treble up and beat low but the speakers bumpin'

[Hook: Chingy]
I can't deny it, I'm a straight rider
You don't wanna fuck with me (with me)
Got them gentals bussin' at me

Sittin' on a throne, "Chingy the King" what I go by (Judah)
Jumped of the slay ship to a spaceship, boy I'm so fly (so fly)
Cut yo' triangle, I whipped my shortminders, know I
You in the kitchen, cookin' up, trynna bake a pie
I'm readin' 'bout my past deception, trynna cremate a lie
Guess I should talk about, bottles, girls, the hood and guns
I've gotten sick of that true sonners and them God Sons

[Outro Talking]
Goin' down for all the wickedness, and what it perpetrated on the Earth
And you're livin' in that time, we're living in that generation
Okay, right now you got the UN armies guarding all the borders, right now
The only job you can get right now, is a military job
There are preparing mass slaughters, over half a million coffins is waiting in, in Half a million waiting in Georgia
Over 2 million coffins is waiting between, between Arizona, Mexico and Canada, okay
All your storing facilities, they've erected
They're ready for a mass murder
Read:
Therefore should all hands be faint
And every mans heart shall melt (2x)
Whoever is not connected to the most high
When this go down, you're not gonna make it, okay
I hate to be the bearer of bad news
But before the most high destroy anything
He sends teachers, to warn the people
And no one listens
No one prophesied for a hundred and twenty years
People looked past him, spit on him, talked, told him he was crazy
Until it rained
Same thing is goin' on now
The most high telling people "you better change"
You knew sooner or later this place would go down
Based on what is perpetrated on the Earth
You gone steal kill, destroy and disease
And believe the man upstairs don't say "you know what, it's time for me to pay this place a visit"
You don't build a country, a country off rape, robbery, robbery and murder
And think God is just gonna stand back and let this be
