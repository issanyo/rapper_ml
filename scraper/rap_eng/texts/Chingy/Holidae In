Bomb ass pussy
Ma, ooh you got that bomb ass pussy
Ma, ooh, you got some bomb ass pussy
Ma, I know you got that bomb bomb pussy
(Whachu doin'?)
Nothing chillin' at the Holidae In
(Who you wit?)
Me and my peeps won't you bring four of your friends
(What we gon' do?)
Feel on each other and sip on some Hen
One thing leading to another let the party begin

Peeps call me up said it's a hotel party
Just bring the liquor there's already eight shawties
I took a chick in the bathroom seeing what's poppin'
You know what's on my mind, shirts off and panties dropping
Now she naked strip teasing, me, I'm just cheesing
I told ol' G, bring tha camera
But no footage as I ram her
Stop, drop kaboom, baby rub on ya nipples
Some call me Dick, some call me Mr. Wiggles
Sippin' some ripple, I got quarters, dimes, and nickels
For shizzle dizzle
I'm on track with Lounge against the machizzle

(Whachu doin'?)
Nothing chillin' at the Holidae In
(Who you wit?)
Me and my peeps won't you bring four of your friends
(What we're gonna do?)
Feel on each other and sip on some Hen
One thing leading to another let the party begin
