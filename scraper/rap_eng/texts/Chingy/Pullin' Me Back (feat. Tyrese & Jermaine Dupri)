(feat. Tyrese)

(Chorus)
Every time I try to leave
Somethin keeps pullin me back, me back
Telling me I need u in my life
Every time I try to go
Somethin keeps tellin me that, me that
Everything gon be alright
Every time I try to leave
Something keeps pullin me back, me back
Telling me I need u in my life
It was meant to be
You were meant for me
So that means we gotta make it work

(Verse 1)
It was all good at first
Spendin money, goin shoppin
Eatin at the finest restaurants
And then from club hoppin
She was right thurr with me bottle poppin livin that life
She just didn't understand my lifestyle and that I don't like
We didn't have a worry in the world, got u diamonds got u pearls
Cut can't help it if Ching-A-Ling been attracting all the girls
Baby I'm a superstar and that come wit it
You got a good nigga on the side, u betta run wit it
Even though I'm on tha road doin shows
I make time for me n her, relationship to grow
They tell me don't trust a woman in this industry
But she not any woman, more like a sacred friend to me
Plus, when I'm outta town, always think of her
May conversate with some chicks, but no one come above her
(Uh) I thought i was your man
Guess u ain't understand
N now I'm sittin herre, lookin crazy like
Damn!

(Chorus)
Every time I try to leave
Somethin keeps pullin me back, me back
Telling me I need u in my life
Every time I try to go
Somethin keeps tellin me that, me that
Everything gon be alright
Every time I try to leave
Something keeps pullin me back, me back
Telling me I need u in my life
It was meant to be
You were meant for me
So that means we gotta make it work

(Verse 2)
Walkin to house from hard work, my head hurts
Instead of arguin, can i have dinner with some dessert (uh uh)
She talkin 'bout this phone number she found
Hey, give me time to put my bags down
She's straight up, clowned
Before we end up fightin, let me leave
I'm exhausted and dis hurr, I don't need
Now I'm wit the fellas ridin n drinkin
She's blowin my two way up but I need some time for thinkin
(Yeah) I wanna go back, but something sayin naaaw
Give her some space and the next day I might call
What should I do
Look, let me ask ya'll
Should I stay and talk, or let this relationship fall
I ain't down on what happened, my feelings crushed
But it happens some time
It's either love it or give it up
I thought I was your man
Guess u ain't understand
N now I'm sittin' herre lookin crazy like
Damn!

(Chorus)
Every time I try to leave
Somethin keeps pullin me back, me back
Telling me I need u in my life
Every time I try to go
Somethin keeps tellin me that, me that
Everything gon be alright
Every time I try to leave
Something keeps pullin me back, me back
Telling me I need u in my life
It was meant to be
You were meant for me
So that means we gotta make it work

(JD:) Chingy holla at dem agian !!

(Verse 3)
Ta all the fellas know u feel me, if u eva had a woman
Good times led to bad times n u ain't see it coming
Try the best to make her happy
But it wasn't enough
Cuz mamma told me in relationship to roll ya bluff
N i don't wanna have my head down
Weak n stressed out
As bad as it hurts i gotta move to the next round
(Uh) I thought i was her man
Guess she ain't understand
N now she's sittin' hurr lookin crazy like
Damn!

(Chorus)
Every time I try to leave
Somethin keeps pullin me back, me back
Telling me I need u in my life
Every time I try to go
Somethin keeps tellin me that, me that
Everything gon be alright
Every time I try to leave
Something keeps pullin me back, me back
Telling me I need u in my life
It was meant to be
You were meant for me
So that means we gotta make it work
