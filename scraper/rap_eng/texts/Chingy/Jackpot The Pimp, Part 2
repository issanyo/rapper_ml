Hey, whats goin' on y'all?
Its your main man, Jackpot The Pimp once again
Did you miss me? Hope not
I've just been pan-handling makin' these hoes walk backwards to the track to get
My stacks or get smacked and my pimpin'
HELL YEAH, 24/7, 3 hundred 65 days outta a yurr, I am, Baby
But check this out, I talk to my main man, Snoop Dogg, the other day
He told me to make a bitch pay like she weigh
Hoe, you made the bed you gotta lie in
Matter of a fact, Bitch, die-in
You see you all this gator skin on me, hoe
Fur on my rolls royce, flow
Take ya shoes off before you get in hurr, bitch
Say what? Pimp, I got the juice
And the flock of hoes im bout to let it loose on your strip
Wurrs my cash, Trick?
Get My Grip
Nigga, quit watchin' Superfly so much
And quit copyin the mack
I really do gotta Cadillac with a wheel
On the back that say Hoe Slayer
