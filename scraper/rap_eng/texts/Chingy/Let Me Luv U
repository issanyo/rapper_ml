Yea…Let me
This that Pro Player Music
Right hurr man
For the playas dirty
Let me
You ain't even gotta say nothing to a girl
You ain't even gotta approach her
She just gonna give it to ya
This ain't for you rookies though
Aim for your best
Get it

(Chorus: Girl)
You can get this lovin
Its nothing
I think I got the something you wanting
So when you leave the club and
Come on in
Private party's jumpin over here
Come on in, come on in, til morning
Come on in
Come on in
Come on in, til morning
Come on in

I bumped in to this chick
Light skin and 5'6"
Thick as a brick
Nice stomach with some wide hips
Approached her like what's good baby?
You seem hood baby
Maybe we could hook up oh yea we should baby
She asked my name
I laugh and flash my chain
I can't stop staring
Damn she got ass and thangs
We can forget about the club and go to my crib
The finer things in life, that's how I live
I told her think about it, take a second, then tell me
She said ain't nothing to think about (ha ha)
Ya smell me
She got close and……..
And almost overdosed
I stays fly ya know ya know

(Chorus: Girl)
You can get this lovin
Its nothing
I think I got the something you wanting
So when you leave the club and
Come on in
Private party's jumpin over here
Come on in, come on in, til morning
Come on in
Come on in
Come on in, til morning
Come on in

(Chingy:)
We on the way to my house
Know what Im thinking about
Pop some Jodecy in
That'll get her wet, no doubt
Look like you been needing a friend
To please, ya heard me
With that gangsta love, girl come ride with a G
Rolled up some of that sticky

Since she like to smoke
Did a 100 to the pad, had to stash the toast
Pulled into the driveway
Hopped out and opened the door
Ya'll might think that's weak
But all the real playas know
Got inside, said she's cold
So I turned the heat on
Persian rug on the floor
To wipe ya feet on
And in 15 minutes, head boss gonna get beat on
She ain't got no man
Ain't got no woman
Who there to cheat on?
Can I get it?

(Chorus: Girl)
You can get this lovin
Its nothing
I think I got the something you wanting
So when you leave the club and
Come on in
Private party's jumpin over here
Come on in, come on in, til morning
Come on in
Come on in
Come on in, til morning
Come on in

(This is how it went down…)

(Chingy:)
We in my bedroom
She ask, can I take a shower
Hell yea, there go the soap, lotion and baby powder
She got undressed in front of me
She must been reading my mind
Glad I ain't buying
This something you'd want to see
Instantly, I snuck in
Then she told me, get in
I grabbed to glasses and a bottle of that Seagrams Gin
So we got in the Ja'causezi
Cause its more relaxing
Call me Mr. Miyabi
Cause that ass I'm gonna be waxing
She got a little tipsy
Then started feeling on me
Then start feeling on herself
Yep, its going down homey
Next thing I know
She went down...I got blessed
Then she got on top and let it drop
You know the rest

(Chorus x2: Girl)
You can get this lovin
Its nothing
I think I got the something you wanting
So when you leave the club and
Come on in
Private party's jumpin over here
Come on in, come on in, til morning
Come on in
Come on in
Come on in, til morning
Come on in
