Pussy niggas (6x)

Verse 1:
Retaliation is a must

If you ain't gettin it, im about ta roll ya right
Like a dodgy blunt (ho) ? pick'in thrown off the side

Verse Two:
Do'in it like Donald Trump
I'm send'in this one to the women with body
And all my hustla's with the grill front
Thats got check / But it ain't gonna last for four months
Bought a chain ? that's some cardy-?) of grain (get it main)
Don't stunt / Get wit my beats in the four blunts-?)
Leave with your cunt
Heads up ? must of broke one
Yeah it's official now (? official now) / Blow your whistle now (? whistle now)
I got a rifle to tell 'em blow your whistle now-?)
When I'm chill'in (when I'm chill'in) / Half fill'in (half fill'in)
Real good watch'in flat screens on the ceil'in
Big wheel'in (big wheel'in) / Quarter melon (quarter melon)
Three hundred c ? plus tar-?) spill'in (?) (bitch!)

Verse Three:
But it depends (? it depends) / On how I feel (? how I feel)
And how you been in the past either your fake or your real
I don't deal / With whole niggas
Cuz whole niggas they / Hamper-?) Dre like they're bigger than they really are
Ride'in in my fast car like Tracy Chapmen
I'm simply rapp'in
Given the world pure satisfaction
If action is what you like to do
Then play your role
Cause I'm tired of niggas com'in in my life (play 'em whole.-?)

Chorus:1x
Ta all my hustla niggas
Fall in(fall in)
Ta all you bitch ass niggas we gone do it again
I got kin(kin) I got friends(friends)and the river don't stop with them
