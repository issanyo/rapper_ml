Intro
My high hat connected to the snur drum
And my snur drum connected to the kick drum
And my kick drum connected to the beat drum
And my beat drum connected to the bass

Bridge
Imma see you when i see you when im riden through the hood
And if i dont say nothin homie know its all good
Cause my speaker steady bumpin and my trunk beat thumpin
Got a pocket full of dough and your whole block jumpin

Chorus (x 2)
I need my high hat
I need my kick drum
I need my ten stacks
Now mumma get some

I make ur body rock
Into the bass drum
Them 808's not
In with the snur drum

Outro (x 2)
High hat
Kick drum
Ten stacks
Now mumma get some
I make ur body rock
Into the bass drum
Them 808's not
In with the snur drum
