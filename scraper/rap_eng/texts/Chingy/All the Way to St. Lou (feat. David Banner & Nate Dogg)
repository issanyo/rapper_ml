(feat. David Banner, Nate Dogg)

(Verse One)
(Chingy)

Young rich and dangerous but not kris kross
Me I was just a running boy til I made it the boss
Got alot on my plate breakfast,lunch and dinner
Call me dear on heart killa yeah bitch i'm a winner
On my block it's lil kids pulling pistol's
In Iraq it's innocent kids dying from missoles
That's why i'm back and taking the title from those before me
Matthew Broadway can never see the day i reach glory
I know parlitions is wishing that banner stop
But I'm ridin with bannana flow and hat cock 4 shots
To my cousin thats lock
Come back soon tome rest in peace to my rilla roc
I'm a affilated hustler so keep ya talk to a minnium
Hate on me first class to ya grave i'm sending em
Give me the rock and i'ma run it back
To all my young niggas out thurr stugglin i hope you make a jack
Where you at

(Nate Dogg)

(Hook)
Back one more again it's Nate Dogg
One day I might stop but not now
My game to damn strong to be stopped
Got hoes every place that i stop
Got beef tell you what I'm gon do
Call up David Banner and demoish ya crew
(David Banner)
Man them laws looking for me man
(Nate Dogg)
Rob to Mississippi All The Way To St.Lou

(Verse Two)
Stressing bout to take 4 blunts to the head
Making a revoulution listening to dead prez
He say, She say i don't curr what they said
Number 1 hustler said equpt with the bread
IRS tripping so fuck the FEDS
Taking shit to these devils cut off my legs
Lord don't let em put me in my death bed
For my son,nieces and newphens life I plede
Sit drinking yak till my eyes get red
Pass me a clip I'm a magnum to the lead
I hope society will let my love spread
Cause my lil cousin steadily thugging before they go I'm dead

(Hook)

(Verse Three)
