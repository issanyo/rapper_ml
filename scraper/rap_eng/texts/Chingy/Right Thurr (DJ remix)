The type of girl that'll getcha' up and go make you grind (Grind)
I'm thinkin' about snatchin' her up, dirty, makin' her mine

Look at her hips (What?), look at her legs, ain't she stacked? (Stacked)
I sure wouldn't mind hittin' that from the back (Back)
I like it when I touch her 'cause she moan a lil' bit
Jeans saggin' so I can see her thong a lil' bit

I know you grown a little bit, twenty years old, you legal
Don't trip off my people, just hop in the regal
I swoop on her like an eagle swoopin' down on its prey
I know you popular, but you gon' be famous today

Her man, he's so wack, girl, can I taste yo cat?

Gave her 300 to strip, like buyin' a throwback
She stay in the club (Club), like to be seen, she got it, honest
In real life, girl remind me of Pocahontas
She be at events (Yeah) stop the press when she pass (yeah)

All the high rollin' cats wanna pay for that ass
Ain't no half steppin' (Steppin'), she strapped with a nice weapon (Weapon), trip
It's against the law for her to move them hips
If you ever seen her dirty, your mouth gon' drop
World wide, fools probably tell you this off tops

Twerkin' in a phatty girl halter top
Then she backed it up on me and let it drop (Drop)

Make it hop (Boing) like a bunny (Bunny)
Girl, can I touch you where it's sunny?
Her appearance will make you give her some money

She should pose for Sports Illustrated
It's like a picture perfect site
When she pass, all the other girls hate it
