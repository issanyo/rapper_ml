See that fur coat, that's for when it's cold
Break that white gold,plain gold, got old
Snake skin shoes, give yo' friends blues
Step out the car, sharp as a fuckin' auto too
Got tall girls, into small girls
Latin, Japanese, Black, Mexican all girls
Willin to work for it, throw in they purse for it
Down wit' me even if they put in a herse for it
Lie in the dirt for it
Call me papi and'll pull up they skirt for it

People ask me why I'm like this
See my father and my uncles gave me this shit
Since I liked it got down and hiked it
That's why you catch me doing foursomes with dike chicks
They like my style, I like they mouth
Even gotta couple hookers workin' the south
And on the east my girls the pay me
In Cali got 10 out on sunset
Pimp of all pimps, young Don Bishop
Got life insurance, trick gon' I won't miss ya'
On the sole of my gators she can kiss the (smooch)
Bitch!
