[Chingy]
(Woo!) Put your hands up {*2X*}
("Deep cause the whole St. Louis is ridin wit me"}
And uhh {"Cause the whole St. Louis is ridin wit me"}
(Woo!) Put your hands up! {*2X*}
And uhh ("Deep cause the whole St. Louis is ridin wit me"}
And uhh {"Cause the whole St. Louis is ridin wit me"}

[Hook: repeat 2X]
Yeah, hurr comes the king of the Midwest
C, H to the I to the N to the G
{"Cause the whole St. Louis is ridin wit me"}
Say what, say what {"Cause the whole St. Louis is ridin wit me"}

[Chingy]
I'm back (yeah I'm back) I ain't went nowhurr
'Cept across the world and back, right hurr and right thurr
It's a fact (it's a fact) I'mma do what I do
Hold the town down, always represent the Lou'
And I pack (and I pack) a 45 for the hate
People like "When it's gon' drop," cause man they can't wait
Ha ha! (Ha ha!) You can catch me on the bricks
In a fly-ass whip, with a fly-ass chick
Talk to 'em Chingy, women tellin me they miss me
All these fools tryin to diss me, these lil' girls tryin to kiss me
(Say what, say what) We're still makin big deals
Still roll on 26's cause I ride big wheels
Yeah - still keepin it real
Still got that thang on me, homey keep that steel
(Stay back, stay back) So if you want me come get me
I ain't trippin {"cause the whole St. Louis is ridin wit me"}
