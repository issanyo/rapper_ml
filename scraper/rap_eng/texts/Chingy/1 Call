[Verse 1]
And I used to love runnin', lookin' for you, yeah
And then I met her, I saw her sweater
It's in the game and that wasn't your thing
And you was in Margiella, I was just another nigga tryna holla
Figured, I would politic ya
So I tried that on the low, baby
I know you deny that, keep it low with a nigga
And I still roll in Miami with sideways, top back
You got a nigga but I'm still your nigga on the low

[Pre-Hook]
'Cause I've been gone for way too long
Down in Miami, been here waiting
'Cause this feeling's way too strong

[Hook]
I'm one call away
If you wanna go, oh, yeah
Girl, I'm just one call away
Girl, I'm just one call away

[Verse 2]
Still on her, still want her, still get her
Still kick the melody when I sing up
Hit record all about you, I figure
You would have to hear it some way
Girl, I've been searching and searching, ain't found it
All of the things that you do just remind me
Where did you go? Girl, you was just beside me
All of the signs, girl, I'm out of time, but I guess I

[Pre-Hook]
I've been gone for way too long
Down in Miami, been here waiting
'Cause this feeling's way too strong

[Hook]
I'm one call away, baby
I just wanna sing to you, woah, yeah
Girl, I'm just one call away
Girl, I'm just one call away

[Outro]
One call, baby, I'm one call away
One call, baby, I'm one call
'Cause I just wanna sing to you
Break it down, baby
Woah, let me break it down for you, babe
Break it down for you
Break it down
Break it down for you
