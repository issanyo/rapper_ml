[Chorus]
I feel lost in the deep end
I feel trapped in a sequence
I feel like I have no cellular
I feel lost on the regular
I’m too trapped in the deep end
I’m stuck facing these demons
I feel like I have no cellular
I feel lost in this regular

[Verse 1]
In this regular
In this regular
I'm trapped deep and I know
One more time til I go
My heart can’t take this anymore
Yeah
Lonely I can't force myself to leave
But I wear this heart on my sleeve
I feel like this will repeat
Yeah
Lately I’ve been working on my own
I'm lost on the road with no phone
I'm lost and my heart feels too cold

[Chorus]
I feel lost in the deep end
I feel trapped in a sequence
I feel like I have no cellular
I feel lost on the regular
I’m too trapped in the deep end
I’m stuck facing these demons
I feel like I have no cellular
I feel lost in this regular

[Verse 2]
In this regular
In this regular
I'm trapped deep and I know
One more time and I go
My heart can’t take this anymore
Yeah
Lonely I can't force myself to leave
But I wear my
On my
For my
On my
Thats right
Thats right
Yeah
