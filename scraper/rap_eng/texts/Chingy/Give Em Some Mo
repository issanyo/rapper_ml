"Give Em Some Mo"

(Intro)
Its your boy chingy
Representin the king
G.I.B. git it boys
Stop hatin' derrty
And maybe you can get some in your life playa

(chorus)
Niggas act like they got paper but no (oo, oo, oo)
Git it boy niggas runnin the show (G.I.B.)
If you wit it get your ass on the floor (get up)
But then right before i finish (get up)
They say give me some mo

(verse 1)
Uhu
4 point 6, dodge in the dits
Trunck full of brick, enought to build a house
To give cat a fix, grand barry six
I gave it to my bitch, but thats how it goes
When a playa rich
On the mound i pitch
Call me mr. quick
In a fast lick
(skert, skert)
Whips
Flyin past grams
Derrty i'm the man
That ya don't understand
Back in hand
If the club wit me
Pop a bottle wit me
Niggas got a problem
Tell'em come get me
The git it boys hurr
And you know
We from that 314

(chorus)
Niggas act like they got paper but no (oo, oo, oo)
Git it boy niggas runnin the show (G.I.B.)
If you wit it get your ass on the floor (get up)
But then right before i finish (get up)
They say give me some mo

See some cats don't understand
How i got this and i got that
Derrty i laid back
Handle my business
Don't bother nobody, don't be hatin and backstabin unlike you fake ass niggas do

(verse 2)
Damn boy wounder
A C3 hummer
Got for the summer
You won't want my number
Don't need that skeka
More friends niether
Tramps want a dollar
Thats why i holla
Young donald trump
Back on this grizzle
Kick in it wit banner
Down in mississippi
Man i'm world wide
Carryin a 4.5
Doin this for life

Biggest street reppers
Waters think they hot
Bout as hot as peppers
Better in my basement
For you funky hoes
Chingy ain't gettin it
Trick gon buy some clothes

(chorus)
Niggas act like they got paper but no (oo, oo, oo)
Git it boy niggas runnin the show (G.I.B.)
If you wit it get your ass on the floor (get up)
But then right before i finish (get up)
They say give me some mo

G.I.B

(Verse 3)
Screw Bill gates
Chain and face
Name in place
In case of anger face
Bing in the scoop
Scale with the doop
A bell with a coke
Therd by the loab
Off in my loaf
Yall rappers think ya'll hard
I know ya'll soft
Its chingy
Ya'll hoes act for me
So i'm gone give it to'em
Like ron jeromey
Mo clarony
Don't slide up
Big cowerd behind me
In da rolls ride up
The sides so rough
Its st. louis
Fussed up grades
Im bout to run for the ciminal of state

(chorus)
Niggas act like they got paper but no (oo, oo, oo)
Git it boy niggas runnin the show (G.I.B.)
If you wit it get your ass on the floor (get up)
But then right before i finish (get up)
They say give me some mo
