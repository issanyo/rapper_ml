[Verse 1:]

They love the luxury cause it get em so moist
Navigation one button activated by a voice
You can call me the king cause I got so many toys
My favorite designer Louis Vaton I'm a shiner
Cocky kinda true as a don big tymer
Rocks will blind ya, yea I'm the bomb street grinder
Cocked the niner now you folks now ya time up
When I'm in LA missta chize I rub back

Flash 100 large make a bet where you scrubs at

They spinin 24's when they sell me the 'cut back
Real cats get down, fake cats get mugged rat
Baby got back now baby can I rub that

[Chorus:]
The phantom 400 you can check the tags
Spent some grands on the Louie luggage check the bags

Get outta line with me partner I'm a check yo ass

The phantom 400 you can check the tags
Spent some grands on the Louie luggage check the bags

[Verse 2:]
Wanna be my boo, plus they caked up
Just stay up on ya fashion always be draped up
And just know this ya man about paper
And when I talk listen hey f**k them haters
O you like Shenell I can take you to meet her
Heels and sandals baby you done wearin' sneakers
Business I handle heads turn when they see us
And if they don't know we gunna make em some believers
Juicy Couture I can see you in that too
Never wear nothing twice everything brand new
Keep your hair done shape right and nails nice
Stay flawless in public if you wanna be my wife
Them other brauds say but hey get them hoes
But they just mad cause I don't sweat them hoes
Cause they mad broke and I get them hoes
My swagga' tight and my sway penny rolls

[Chorus:]
The phantom 400 you can check the tags
Spent some grands on the Louie luggage check the bags
Get outta line with me partner I'm a check yo ass
I'm fresh to death so baby check my swag
Check my swag, check check my swag [x4]
The phantom 400 you can check the tags
Spent some grands on the Louie luggage check the bags
Get outta line with me partner I'm a check yo ass
I'm fresh to death so baby check my swag
