There she go with that coke bottle, body guns, bang, bang
When she drop it on down, doing her thang, thang
And I can't stop assuming her

She get it in then she run, run with it
Break it on down, 911 with it dumb, dumb did it
Took my fit it, wink her eye then I go, go get it, ay
I got nothing to say, all she wants is to play

Then I close my eyes and realize that I want this to sway
Don't get up on the 5's, I looked her right in the eyes
We feeling like these feathers stuck together, blowing away
