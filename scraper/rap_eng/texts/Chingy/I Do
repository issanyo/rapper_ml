[Intro]
Chingy, Track Stars (How many rides you got, dirty?)
Well, I got a Caprice on 24's
I got a Range Rover with spinners
I got an Impala with beat (let's go)

[Hook]
I do ride Bentleys and coupes
But I don't give away all my loot
Trick four've us and a tramp, I won't
Ride less then 20 inches, I don't – but I do…

[Verse 1]
Know this might be a single when I brought my chains on
So they might jingle if she give me brains on
The haters know where my crew is, so famous
That I can't go nowhere in the Lou, you name it
The mall, the gas station, them people be waitin'
To see me hop in somethin' hatin' all them duece duece skatin'
Runnin' it like Walter Payton, and tell you "fuck you"
I'm so blatent, the paper I'm savin', my bank acount is amazin'
I'm ratin' myself a 20, I'm takin' myself a 20
I'm doin' this show for 20, then holla at me in 20
About money, I gots to make
Stack up a couple hundred mil then take my ass a break

[Hook 2x]

[Verse 2]
I gotta 75 Caprice in my yard
A Loui drop top graphics, man, it's hard
Custom made interior, dirty, it's the shit
Dayton spins and spokes 24's on it
Yup, got a TV and steerin' wheels like Luda
And if you run up on me, look, dirty, I'll shoot ya
G.I.B 1 on my customized plates
Slide a lot of bottles, don't never come fake
I'm about to hit Lillian, just past Clackston
Whippin' with a piece that's better than Toni Braxton's
Ain't no right, no rhythm in with my few team bumps
I got the three amps and the woofers in my trunk
Yeah, I know you money hungry hoes wanna roadtrip
You know I ride nothin' less than them Dubs

[Hook]

[Bridge]
Pretty honey hit me lookin' good
Right sittin' on the banks lookin' good
100 000 round my neck lookin' good
Cappers tryin' to run up, I wish she would

[Verse 3]
I role with nothing but ballers with 26's with them chrome lips
Rims on the truck make them heffers get hypnotized quick
Candy colored paint, makin' them tricks faint
And there's bars on my top er'y time to step up into my whip
OG blue secrets, money makin', you fools sick
Us slingin thurr, my dirtys flippin' some whole bricks
I don't give a damn if you don't give a damn
I'ma stunt, I'm gonna go and let us know who I am
Cars, clothes, money, ice, straps, clips, hoes, dikes
Magnums, freaks house, price, 1 point 5 life

[Hook]
