Uh...Uh...Uh..He's here...He's Here...He's Here
He..is..here..is he..really?

[Chorus]
Don't be scurred now
Got it made now
From the leg down
He..is..here

Don't be scurred now
Got it made now
Just pray to God I don't get you

[Verse 1 - Chingy]
Back slap that ass
Clap that ass
Dropping body bags
Glocks and mags
Four blocks you fast
Talk your trash (Drop you fast)
Never jock a cat
I will blast
Shot is stacked
Rock your hair
Watch my mirror
Stocking caps so I watch my style
Cock and grab
Open up shop and draft
Quarter bags all of that
Water lasts shorter halves
Have ya comin back cause I'm fourth of stash
Extort the hash
Extort the wrath
Cope the past
Brought my mags
Sort my cash on the docks
Flock a hop
Keep it in a proper spot
Adopt a cop
Rob a spot
A lot of ice a cop or not
Drop a pot
Slide a lot
Jackpot a lot
Already got a lot of wine, but not in my ride, I'll stop

[Chorus] - 2X

We..are..dangerous
He'll mangle us
Who playing with us?
And saying this stuff?
And fuck with gangs and stuff?
I aim to bust
You straight up tough
No thanks to us
We're famous, duh
A game I love
To train my sluts
To give brains and cuss
Learn pain and plus
Get tricks to claim the bust
Think they nuts
Slurp them up
Hook or work them up
Wake them up, break them up
Taking crust shake them up
Make it stuck in your twat
Hit the streets, bend the blocks
Sin or not, hit the daily spot
Gin or scotch, top notch
On my roster
Mobster eating pasta
Chop her in the closer, crack her like a lobster
Have my ho to rob you
Then dodge you
Any ho need work?  I got a job for you
Go see the supplier
Make like you a buyer
Then buy slut, trick these fake playas
Often what they say, you'll buy em up messiah
Wait and bring it bacj to my empire
Chingy keep these heffers on the strip and on fire
Try her

[Chorus] - 4X
