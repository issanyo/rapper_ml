So dudes be handcuffin but dirrty that ain't fairr

Out-a-towners come around and straight over dose
Where the hips sing to ya and swing like, BUMP, BUMP, BUMP

Back out legs showin talkin like mann
Who got the drink and where the party at tonight damn
That's when they start that backing it up on ya homie and
That's a feelin' you just can't fight
We fired up off that Hypnotic and Hennessey
She can't keep her motherfuckin' hands off me
We both in the club high bouncing to the beat
When she turn around this is what I told her
