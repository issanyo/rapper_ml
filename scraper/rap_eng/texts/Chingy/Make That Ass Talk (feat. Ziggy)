How the hell did you get all of that in dem jeans?
How the how the hell did you get all of that in dem jeans?
'Cause your waist so little and your ass it like wo
'Cause your waist so little and your ass it like wo

Prada, Gucci
Tell me what you like
Coach bag
With the shoes
To match
Forget the price
Marc Jacob shades
Fifty karats all ice
Model in dem jeans for me
Luxury now that's your life
That's the type of shit I'm on
Let me see you get them on
Back it up a bit
Yeah that's it
'Cause I can see your thong
Carmale skin tone
Daum you look like Nia Long
Don't be acting like that lil mama
'Cause I can leave you 'lone
Mix the lime with that Patron
That's what we drinking on
She wanna go out to eat
But me JD I'm think home
Just so I can see 'em off
But what the hell we both grown
Wearin' dem jean like that
Will make me take trips with you to Rome
Hey now (hey, hey), hey now (hey)
You know they thick from the STL to the A~Town
Hey now (hey, hey), hey now (hey)

Baby lay down

[Chorus]
Daum girl
How'd you get all that in
Dem jeans

How'd you get all that in Dem?
Daum girl

(Is you talking to me?)
Yeah, you
I bet you had to jump up and down
Just to put 'em on
Bet you had to wiggle it around
Just to put 'em on
Bet you had to lay back on the bed
Just to zip 'em up
Am I right?
(You right)
Baby that's what's up

Now. Now. Now
When walkin' girl
And you make it swirl

And I want you in my world
Bubbled up (oh)

Licking' my lip saying
Shawaty swing it my way

Dem pants ma
Hope you ain't up in here with your man ma
I love it when you wiggle it Shake it
Drop it and do your little dance
True Religion, 7's
Or dem rocking Republics
Or the ones that fit the best
And show it just how we love it
Know just how to hug it
Know just how to cup it
When you walk away it make me wanna rub it
Hey now (hey, hey). Hey now (hey)
You know they thick from A~Town down to H~Town
Hey now (hey, hey). Hey now (hey)
Let me help you with dem jeans

[Chorus]
I don't mean to be rude
But I like the way you move
Got your boy in the mood
Let's go back to magic cruise I ain't like the mother fools got
To play by ma rules face down, ass p, pants off look (uh)
There it go
Don't be scared
Let it show it
Like them curves make that thing talk when you walk
I'm slurring ma words
Drop it to the floor

Ain't no hating girl got to sing it
Like the style but man you working them a lot

[Chorus x2]
Baby that's what's up
