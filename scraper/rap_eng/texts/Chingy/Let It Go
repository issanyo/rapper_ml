Born 5, 10, twenties I let it go
Somebody better let her know I let it go
Ups have it ground to the floor lady let it go
Gotta hold lot of money I let it go
Ups, I let it go, ups I let it go
I let it go, let it go
Your man sipping on cocaine, I let it go
I let it go
Pull up to the club I'm in the black
A black, it master burn
Don't... grind
No horsing
Joking but I'm not the dirt
20 stacks in jeans
Them chicks flocking over 'cause they know we got it
And now I'm in the building and we
My money hel me your child on the
M

Muggin

Your paper cry

Fighting over this dollar
So don't be surprised like some f*cking
But they not alive

Fresh hood then in my
Pounds hey got them pounds
