[Intro: Soulja Boy & Chingy]
Turn-turn it up, turn-turn it up
Turn-turn it up, turn-turn it up
Turn-turn it up, turn-turn it up
Turn-turn it up, turn-turn it up
Ayy, Soulja Boy Tell 'Em
Got Chingy, got Chingy
One, two step, just two step
One, two step, just two step
One, two step, just two step
Let's go

[Hook: Chingy & Soulja Boy]
Ayye!
I got the beat, beat quakin' and the 808 knock
Ridin' thorugh your city, beat-beatin' down your block
Them hoes gotta choose, them hoes gotta choose
Turn-turn it up, turn-turn it up
Them hoes gotta choose, them hoes gotta choose
Turn-turn it up, turn-turn it up
I got the chain (chain) swanging (swanging)
Watch (watch) blanging (blanging)
Stunna shade's on, block-blocking off the haters
Them hoes gotta choose, them hoes gotta choose
Turn-turn it up, turn-turn it up
Them hoes gotta choose, them hoes gotta choose
Turn-turn it up, turn-turn it up

[Verse 1: Chingy]
I got a mansion on my neck, Ferrari on my wrist
Receive and write checks, hoe why you think I'm rich?
Drop a mill on the jets 'cause I can take the best
Bachelor pad in Dubai, that's just to take my bitch
One, two step, just two step
Slot-A-Lot, G.I.B., my whole crew reppin'
"Hater-Blockers" on, yeah they Prada baby
The dirty got a "he", but he ain't hotter baby
This a 2012 (my whip), can you match that?
This whip don't come out till then, you prolly didn't catch that
Them 6 12's hittin', knockin' pictures down
That magazine ready, come getcha issue clown
Hahaha!

[Hook: Chingy & Soulja Boy]
I got the beat, beat quakin' and the 808 knock
Ridin' thorugh your city, beat-beatin' down your block
Them hoes gotta choose, them hoes gotta choose
Turn-turn it up, turn-turn it up
Them hoes gotta choose, them hoes gotta choose
Turn-turn it up, turn-turn it up
I got the chain (chain) swanging (swanging)

Turn-turn it up, turn-turn it up

[Verse 2: Soulja Boy]
Aye, aye, aye Soulja Boy Tell 'Em!
Gucci bandana, white [?]
Aston Martin, [?]
I go so hard like I took some Viagra
With a Chinese chick and her pussy diagonal, goddamn!
Gettin' silly, count a milly in Piccadilly
SOD Money Gang, pounds in the ceiling
Trunk beatin', makin' quake sounds in the building
Soulja Boy Tell 'Em got Chingy hurt these niggas feelings, damn!
I hit your baby moma on the d-low
Baby hold your round down, don't wanna hurt his ego
Now all I gotta do is make a call to my people
Now turn the speakers up and watch this fucking beat go...
Ckyuah!

[Hook: Chingy & Soulja Boy]
I got the beat, beat quakin' and the 808 knock

Turn-turn it up, turn-turn it up

[Verse 3: Chingy]
Check it out
Car lot in my drive way so I call that bitch "drop and go"
Different colorize and colors as a box of Popsicles
Hood so clean, look like I hit that shit with "Mop & Glo"
Yeah we on fire, hoes tellin' me and Soulja droppin' row, droppin' row
Keep so much cash, man I can drop a [?]
[?]
I come around, hoes fall like dominos, dominos
Hit that thang then till Obama knows, 'bama knows
Some of you rappers tell me it's comical
Call me Steven Spielberg 'cause I bring that drama folk
Slip up, talkin' crazy, I'mma let that chrome llama go
Llama go what? Turn the beat up, then I'mma go..

[Hook: Chingy & Soulja Boy]
I got the beat, beat quakin' and the 808 knock
