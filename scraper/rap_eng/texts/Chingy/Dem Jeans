[Intro: Chingy & JD]
You already know, ha-ha, Slot-a-lot, SoSoDef
And if you're a bad chick get on the floor and....
How the, hell did you get all of that in dem jeans?
(Bounce, bounce, bounce)
How the how the hell did you get all of that in dem jeans?
(If you're a bad chick get on the floor and bounce)
Cause your waist so little and your ass is like whoa
(Yeah I know what this is, SoSoDef!)
Cause your waist so little and your ass is like whoa

[Verse 1: Chingy]
Prada, Gucci, tell me what you like?
Coach bag with the shoes to match, forget the price
Marc Jacob shades, 50 karats all ice
Model in dem jeans for me, luxury, now that's your life
That's the type of shit I'm on
Let me see you get them on
Back it up a bit, yeah that's it, cause I can see your thong
Caramel skin tone
Damn, you look like Nia Long
Don't be acting like that lil' mama, cause I can leave you 'lone
Mix the lime with that Patron
That's what we drinking on
She wanna go out to eat, but me, JD, I'm thinkin' home
Just so I can see 'em off
But what the hell we both grown
Wearin' dem jean like that will make me take trips with you to Rome

[Pre-Hook 1: Chingy]
Hey now (hey, hey), hey now (hey)

[JD]
Now. Now. Now

Bubbled up (Oh)
Poking out (Hey)
Lickin' my lip saying, shawty swing it my way
Damn, Ma, damn, Ma
How the hell you get all that in dem pants ma
Hope you ain't up in here with your man ma
I love it when you wiggle it, shake it
Drop it, and do your little dance
True Religion, 7's or dem rocking Republics
Or the ones that fit the best and show it just how we love it
Know just how to hug it
Know just how to cuff it
When you walk away it make me wanna rub and say

[Pre-Hook 2: Chingy & JD]

[Verse 3: Chingy]
I don't mean to be rude
But I like the way you move
Got your boy in the mood
Let's go back to my jacuzz'
I ain't like them other fools
Got to play by my rules
Face down, ass up, pants off, look (ooh)
There it go, don't be scared
Let it show it, like them curves
Make that thing talk, when you walk, I'm slurring my words
Drop it to the floor, ya heard
Ain't no hating girl, ya hot
Like the style but man you working them a lot
