Hey man, (what?)
You think you got the game (yeah)
Well check this out
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, do what you do

[Chorus]
I'm bout to shake 'N bake ya right thurr (right thurr)
From the three point line, I dont curr (dont curr)
I'm bout to shake 'N bake ya right thurr (right thurr)
Cross over make the whole crowd sturr (crowd sturr)

[Chingy]
I like the way the crowd churr when I lay it up (up)
Like EA Sports I'm in the game 'N playin tough (tough)
The day is on, bout to take it to the hoop
But first, let me come out my warm up suit
I play the court (court), while you fools play the bench
Yo coach dont know, that play didn't make no sense
Pass it, Steal it, its all team work
Cheerleaders on the sideline in they Chingy shirts
My dribble is wicked as I drive down the lane
To the hoop, I take it, shake 'n bake it, it ain't no thang
Once I get in the game, dont worry bout a thang
But why ima be the MVP with a ring

[Chorus 2x]
I'm bout to shake 'N bake ya right thurr (right thurr)
From the three point line, I dont curr (dont curr)
I'm bout to shake 'N bake ya right thurr (right thurr)
Cross over make the whole crowd sturr (crowd sturr)

[Chingy Missing lyrics]

[Chorus 2x]
I'm bout to shake 'N bake ya right thurr (right thurr)
From the three point line, I dont curr (dont curr)
I'm bout to shake 'N bake ya right thurr (right thurr)
Cross over make the whole crowd sturr (crowd sturr)
