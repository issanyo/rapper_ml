[Intro: Vinni & (Chingy)]
Yo
We need to clean this earth up don't you think?
(Yeah, I think so)
Stop all wars, create more peace
Do it right about the kids
(Make a change)

[Hook: Vinni x2]
Learn to live, live to learn
Get rich, give back, that's my concern
What we gon' do with this money we earn?
Clean up the community and it's your turn

[Verse 1: Vinni]
Stop the violence, create some love
People acting like it is too late to love
For the kids at home, I'ma save a hood
I don't think your witness still convicted by the judge
What goes up, must come down
To all my folks in jail, I'll always be around
Kids know about war, don't know about school
Knowledge is power, a wise man I'm [?]
And same my [?], I use that as my tool
Clean up the ghetto and things might be cool
Got a golden life? Win, and don't lose
Want to change the earth? Show love; the first move

[Hook: Vinni x2]

[Verse 2: Chingy]
Man, I'm thinking we got it all wrong
We steady wondering what god we're supposed to call on
Knowing tomorrow, everything here could be all gone
That's why I'm hoping that today will be the day, we stop being morons
But I knew all along, that it could never happen
That it will never be 'cause jealousy is all the fashion
Still, all I'm asking, just work with me
And feel our knowledge and compassion place perfectly
It never hurts to see, it's ok to be afraid
See, these kids they be looking for ways to be amazed
Ways to lead astray, games that people play
That's the way good folks get to see the gray

[Hook: Vinni x2]

[Verse 3: Diaz]
If anybody gave back, it was me
All my hometown be like, it was D
That never forgot us, because he's
Big hearted, he and the hood never parted
Se I'ma make bread, then break bread
I got money on my mind, I'm a cakehead
I wish I could pass by heaven [?]
Instead I go and spill a little hand out
I'ma hand out words to folks like Jesus
I put that on my uncles and nieces
Unborn to those that already left me
I try to son, [?]

[Hook: Vinni x2]
