Every time I try to leave
Something keeps pullin' me back, me back
Tellin' me I need you in my life
Every time I try to go
Something keeps tellin' me that, me that
Everything gon' be all right
Every time I try to leave
Something keeps pullin' me back, me back
Tellin' me I need you in my life
It was meant to be, you were meant for me
So that means we gotta make it work
It was all good at first, spendin' money, goin' shoppin'
Eatin' at the finest restaurants and if I'm club hoppin'
She was right thurr wit me, bottle poppin', livin' that life
She just didn't understand my lifestyle and that I ain't like
We didn't have a worry in the world, gotcha diamonds, gotcha pearls
But I can't help it if Chinga-ling be attractin' all the girls
Say what? Baby, I'ma superstar and that come wit it
Gotta good nigga on your side, you betta run wit it
Even though I'm on the road doin' shows
I made time for me and hurr, relationship to grow
They tell me don't trust a woman in this industry
But she not any woman, more like a sacred friend to me
'Cuz when I'm outta town, always think of hurr
Might conversate wit some chicks but no one come above hurr
I thought I was ya man, guess you ain't understand
And now I'm sittin' here, lookin' crazy like damn
Every time I try to leave
Something keeps pullin' me back, me back
Tellin' me I need you in my life
Every time I try to go
Something keeps tellin' me that, me that
Everything gon' be all right
Every time I try to leave
Something keeps pullin' me back, me back
Tellin' me I need you in my life
It was meant to be, you were meant for me
So that means we gotta make it work
Walk in the house wit hard work, my head hurt
Instead of arguin', can I have dinner wit some dessert? Uh uh
She talkin' 'bout this phone number she found
Ain't gimme time to put my bags down, she straight up clownin'
Before we end up fightin', let me leave
I'm exhausted and this here, I don't need
Now I'm wit the fellaz, ridin' and drinkin'
She blowin' my two-way up but I need some time for thinkin'
Yeah, I wanna go back, but sumthin' sayin' naw
Lemme give her some space and the next day, I might call
What should I do? Look, lemme ask y'all
Should I stand tall or let this relationship fall?
I ain't down wit havin' my feelings crushed
But it happens sometimes, either love it or give it up
I thought I was your man, guess you ain't understand
And now I'm sittin' here, lookin' crazy like damn
Every time I try to leave
Something keeps pullin' me back, me back
Tellin' me I need you in my life
Every time I try to go
Something keeps tellin' me that, me that
Everything gon' be all right
Every time I try to leave
Something keeps pullin' me back, me back
Tellin' me I need you in my life
It was meant to be, you were meant for me
So that means we gotta make it work
To all the fellaz, know you feel me, you ever had a woman
Good times led to bad times and you ain't see it comin'
Tried your best to make her happy but it wasn't enough
'Cuz Mama told me in relationships, the road get rough
And I ain't the one to have my head down, weepin', stressed out
As bad as it hurts, I gotta move to the next route, yes
I thought I was her man, guess she ain't understand
And now she sittin' thurr, lookin' crazy like damn
Every time I try to leave
Something keeps pullin' me back, me back
Tellin' me I need you in my life
Every time I try to go
Something keeps tellin' me that, me that
Everything gon' be all right
Every time I try to leave
Something keeps pullin' me back, me back
Tellin' me I need you in my life
It was meant to be, you were meant for me
So that means we gotta make it work
Said, we gotta make it work, baby
