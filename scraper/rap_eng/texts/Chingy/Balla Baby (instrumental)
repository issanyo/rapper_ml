You know the definition of a balla (uh-huh)
That's me
C-H-I-N-G to the Y
Let me explain it to you though

(Chorus)
I'm a balla (say what)
High, roller baby (baby, baby)
Shot colla (thats right)
Drivin chickens crazy (like me)
You a hater (you a hater)
Why you tryin to play me (I don't think he know)
Fake playa (yeap, fake playa)
Scared I'll take your lady (hey, I'm a balla for real)
(oh, oh, oh)

(Verse 1)
Girl I know you do the nasty (nasty)
I could tell when ya (when ya) walked past me (past me)
And your Prada lookin flashy
Errthing's on your mind, just ask me 
I know my ear related to da wasky wabbit
Carats all in it jazzy, it's a habit (uh)
Hoe where's my cash
Outside I got a Benz and Jag (both sittin on chrome mags)
Is you down wit gettin dirty wit a 'Git It' boy
All I need is one night just to hit it boy
After the club we can check in at five-star telly
Get a suite and let me put somethin in your belly
What's your name? Sheena
Oh, I thought you was Shelly
Don't matter four o'clock, just be ready
For a episode you probably won't come
Back from, your momma must be thick
That's where ya get your back from?

(Chorus)

(Verse 2)
GIB we keep it crackin ask Em and Rich, (whats up)
The girls on us so dirty who you rollin wit, (GIB)
From Magic City to the pink slip in the Lou, (Lou)
Them chicks love the diamonds that I get from rob jewels
We be in the spot maaaan hang up flirtin
We be surrounding by girls man and I ain't burping
All I know is money, cash, hoes, like Jay
And I got all three no I don't play
Chicks call me drama king like Kayslay, (Kayslay)
Cuz in the bed I bring it, yeah night and day
Lettin rounds off in em like an AK
You leavin wit me tell me is it free or do I have to pay, (what you say?)

(Chorus)

(Verse 3)
I like them black, white, Puerto Rican, or Haitian
Like Japanese, Chinese, or even Asian, (okay)
Don't matter what color on this occasion, (fo sho)
Like smoke take a hit of what I'm blazin
Instead of God it's me these girls praisin
Meet me at about 6 at the Days Inn
5 of em, 1 of me, I'm feelin caged in
I'm a pimp, I'ma keep on playin
You know I love em for that one night, (one night)
I could take on ten with my one pipe, (one pipe)
Knock em all like a bowling pin on site, (on site)
Make em soak, change, girl look herre you better get your mind right, (cuz...)

(Chorus)
Ain't nobody gettin it like me
