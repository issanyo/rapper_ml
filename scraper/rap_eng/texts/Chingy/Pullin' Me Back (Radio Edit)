Every time I try to leave
Somethin' keeps pullin' me back, me back
Telling me I need u in my life
Every time I try to go
Somethin' keeps tellin' me that, me that
Everything gon' be alright
Every time I try to leave
Something keeps pullin' me back, me back
Telling me I need u in my life
It was meant to be
You were meant for me
So that means we gotta make it work
It was all good at first
Spendin' money, goin' shoppin'
Eatin' at the finest restaurants
And if I'm club hoppin'
She was right thurr with me bottle poppin'
Livin' that life
She just didn't understand my lifestyle
And that I ain't like
We didn't have a worry in the world
Got u diamonds, got u pearls
But I can't help it if Ching-A-Ling be
Attracting all the girls
Baby, I'm a superstar
And that come wit it
You got a good ***** on your side
U betta run wit it
Even though I'm on tha road doin' shows
I made time for me n her relationship to grow
They tell me don't trust a woman in this industry
But she not any woman, more like a sacred friend to me
Plus, when I'm outta town
Always think of her
Might conversate with some chicks
But no one come above her
Uh, I thought I was your man
Guess u ain't understand
And now I'm sittin' herre lookin' crazy like
Damn!
Every time I try to leave
Somethin' keeps pullin' me back, me back
Telling me I need u in my life
Every time I try to go
Somethin' keeps tellin' me that, me that
Everything gon' be alright
Every time I try to leave
Something keeps pullin' me back, me back
Telling me I need u in my life
It was meant to be
You were meant for me
So that means we gotta make it work
Walk in the house from hard work
My head hurts
Instead of arguin'
Can I have dinner with some dessert?
Uh uh, she talkin' 'bout this phone number she found
Didn't give me time to put my bags down
She's straight up, clowned
Before we end up fightin'
Let me leave
I'm exhausted and dis hurr
I don't need
Now I'm wit the fellas
Ridin' n drinkin'
She blowin' my two way up
But I need some time for thinkin'
Yeah, I wanna go back
But something sayin' naw
Let me give her some space
And the next day I might call
What should I do?
Look, let me ask ya'll
Should I stand tall
Or let this relationship fall?
I ain't down wit havin' my feelings crushed
But it happens sometimes
Either love it or give it up
I thought I was your man
Guess u ain't understand
And now I'm sittin' herre lookin' crazy like
Damn!
Every time I try to leave
Somethin' keeps pullin' me back, me back
Telling me I need u in my life
Every time I try to go
Somethin' keeps tellin' me that, me that
Everything gon' be alright
Every time I try to leave
Something keeps pullin' me back, me back
Telling me I need u in my life
It was meant to be
You were meant for me
So that means we gotta make it work
(Chingy holla at â€~em again!)
Ta all the fellas know u feel me
If u eva had a woman
Good times led to bad times
N u ain't see it coming
Try your best to make her happy
But it wasn't enough
â€~Cause momma told me in
Realtionships the road get rough
N I ain't the one to have my head down
Weak n stressed out
As bad as it hurts
I gotta move to the next route
Yes, I thought I was her man
Guess she ain't understand
And now she sittin' thurr lookin' crazy like
Damn!
Every time I try to leave
Somethin' keeps pullin' me back, me back
Telling me I need u in my life
Every time I try to go
Somethin' keeps tellin' me that, me that
Everything gon' be alright
Every time I try to leave
Something keeps pullin' me back, me back
Telling me I need u in my life
It was meant to be
You were meant for me
So that means we gotta make it work
Said we gotta make it work baby, ooh
