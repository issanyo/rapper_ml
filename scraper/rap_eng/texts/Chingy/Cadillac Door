Yes
Hey yo, what up
This one for all my homeboys across the world, right, been through some shit
I know you've all had a lot on your mind, man
Had a lot of struggles you went through in your life
Keep your head up dirty

Chorus 1:
I've been through the dirt, been slammed from right to left
I've been hit, been low, been high, I guess...
I'm like a Cadillac door (say what)
I'm like a Cadillac door (say what)

See the star was born
Don't think nobody notice
Goin' through these trials and tribulations kept me on focus
Tried to do a 9-5, but where's the money?
Coming to work damn near bumming, people thinkin' it's funny (haha)
I'm fed up
Plus my homies sellin' crack doin good
Now I'm thinking fuck doing it legal bring it back to the hood
Man it's hell, you see, wasn't no woman there for me
I ain't got shit but a dream, that's why they chose to ignore me

Chorus 1:
I've been through the dirt, been slammed from right to left
I've been hit, been low, been high, I guess...
I'm like a Cadillac door (say what)
I'm like a Cadillac door (say what)

Chorus 2:
I've been through the dirt, been slammed from right to left
But I ain't blowin' up I'm built to ride to death
I'm like a Cadillac door (say what)
I'm like a Cadillac door (say what)

Hey
Now I'm on the block pumping rocks toting blocks
Grand-mama on my head, I'm ducking and dodging the cops
All cuz I'm trying to make a living (living)
Consequences of that:
End up dead or in prison, ain't shit given
I done struggled too long not to floss and get on
Imma get it with the double, if not the microphone.I'm headstrong plus I'm out for those dead presidents
And the government ain't doing shit for my residence

Chorus 1:
I've been through the dirt, been slammed from right to left
I've been hit, been low, been high, I guess...
I'm like a Cadillac door (say what)
I'm like a Cadillac door (say what)

Chorus 2:
I've been through the dirt, been slammed from right to left
But I ain't blowin' up I'm built to ride to death
I'm like a Cadillac door (say what)
I'm like a Cadillac door (say what)

It's been a long time coming (yeah we struggled)
It's been a bumpy ride (but we gonna make it)
So these wheels will keep on turning (say what)
Till the day I die (ride with me fo a minute yall). [x2]

Chuch
Now my homies busted and getting shot at it's getting serious
Plus I'm praying but they breaking down in tears
See now that I'm on, people think money make you proud
But I've been struggling trying to come up since I was a child
Who are you to judge me for my sins and what I did wrong
I'm trying to live don't my mama singing a sad song
They say look out for your family and so I try to shurr
Look Tommy I miss you but I'll see you when I get thurr

Chorus 1:
I've been through the dirt, been slammed from right to left
I've been hit, been low, been high, I guess...
I'm like a Cadillac door say what
I'm like a Cadillac door say what

Chorus 2:
I've been through the dirt, been slammed from right to left
But I ain't blowin' up I'm built to ride to death
I'm like a Cadillac door say what
I'm like a Cadillac door say what
