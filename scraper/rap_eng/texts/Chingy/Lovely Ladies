Without great grandmother theres no me
Without grandmama theres no me
Without ma momma theres no me
Dem ladies made our family tree
Because i love dem all da same
And think of em all da same
Need sumthin juss ask i got it covered ain't no thang
Ma autn jenni works hard and i appreciate that
So threw this song ima give my appreciation back
Remember a long time ago i would be down in da basement rappin
Shed stomp on da floor n say quit all dat damn snappin
She ain't no 20 years from den datz wats makin all dis happen
She ain't no at ma shows 50,000 ppl clappin
Plus i wish i culda seen her face wen i bought dat pad
Dat waz juss a cool thank you gift from ur growner lad
