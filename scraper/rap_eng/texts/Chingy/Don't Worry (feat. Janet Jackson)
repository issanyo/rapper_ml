Eh, wassup?
You haven't been talkin' to me for a couple of days
But it's all good
I just wanted to let you know that
I know, I do some things that's wrong
You do some things that's wrong
You know what I'm sayin?
We ain't perfect
We all make mistakes
Nah nah nah, hold on
I'm talkin' to you
Don't just be tryna' leave and stuff like that
I'm talkin' to you
I'm tryna make things better for me and you

Just me and you
(Ooh Chingy)
Don't matter what we go through
Just me and you
We don't need nobody else
Just me and you
(Ooh Chingy)
And I'ma always be down for you
Just me and you
So don't worry bout a damn thang

Now that we together girl the light's so bright
It took a lil' time but now the feelin so right
Remember when I snuck through your window at night?
Bringin' you flowers and candy
Me and you sippin' on Brandy
Plus I appreciate the love on sight
Huggin' me, holdin' me
Fix dinner, so polite (thank you baby)
Even when them stupid pigs was tryna sue me
Forget about friends and family
You tha one that knew me
The way you smile at me
Keep me feelin' alright
This ain't about furs, fancy cars, or ICE
So I'm dedicatin' this to my female friend
Sincerely yours
Words can't express my feelings within

Just me and you
(Ooh Chingy)
Don't matter what we go through
Just me and you
We don't need nobody else
Just me and you
(Ooh Chingy)
And I'ma always be down for you
Just me and you
So don't worry bout a damn thang

We human so we gon' fight and fuss at each other
He told me you trippin' but girl don't worry bout my brother
We have a argument, it drive me to go out
You my flesh, so me and another woman won't BOUT (bout meaning
Thinkin' bout the times when you flew to my house
Gonna give you everything that you want
This man ain't a mouse
Am I cheatin'?
Hell naw, hope you got no doubts
Rose petals in tha tub
Baby, unbutton that blouse
Wait, better yet, come ON YOU HUNGRY? LETS GO eat at Mr. Chow's
Know you love me
When you mad, you don't get loud
So I'm dedicatin' this to my female friend
Sincerely yours
Words can't express my feelin' within

Just me and you

And I'ma always be down for you

So don't worry bout a damn thang

I like your style, your grace, your beautiful face, your essence
Your size, your shape, this beautiful place, a blessin'
Your weight, your waist, your delicious taste, perfecting
Your height, your sight, with my life as your protection
So sweet like CANDY, let's raise a family in Miami
Where the beach so sandy, toast two champagne glasses, you and me
Your scent, like the smell of fresh AIR (pronounced URR) of relief
And for you I go over my budget
No I ain't CHEAP
Can't stop grindin'til I get EVERY(pronounced ERRY) RECORD to the top
Just Know that you on my mind erry second on the clock
Tick tock, if you ever need help, scream (Oooh)
And I come runnin for my life,to trade it in for your dreams
