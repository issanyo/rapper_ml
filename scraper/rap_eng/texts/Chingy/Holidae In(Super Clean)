Peeps call me up {*phone ring*} said it's a ho-tel party
Just bring the liquor there's already eight shawties
I'm on my way (way) let me stop by the store
Get a 12 pack of Corona, plus an {coughs} of 'dro, ya know?
Now I'm on Highway 270 to Natural Bridge Road
I'm already UHHH, hit third I'm a be Ooh some mo'
Pulled up, stop parked, rims still spinning
Valet look like he in the game and must be winning
To room 490 I'm headed, on my way up
There's three girls on the elevator like wassup
I told em follow me they knew I had it cracking B
One said ain't you that boy that be on BET?
Ya that's me, Ching-a-ling equipped wit much ding-a-ling
Knock on the door I'm on the scene of things Busted in
Henny bottle to the face! OOOH it then, feel like my head a toxic waste
There's some pretty girls in herre
I heard em whispering
Talking bout that's that dude that sing
'Right Thurr' he glistening
I ain't come to talk (talk)

What I came for was to find out who I'm gon hit, AWWW

You know what's on my mind, SHHH off and AWW dropping
OOOH knocking on the door drunk
And silly The girl said can I be in yo video

Now she UHHH strip teasing, me
I'm just cheesing She gave me a reason to be a {dings} heathen
Handled that, told ol'

Then I thought about, no footage while I ram her
Walked out the bathroom smiling
Cats still whiling
Sharing the next room wit some girls lookin like they from an island

Stop, drop, KABOOM!, baby rub on ya UHHH
Some call me Ludacris, some call me Mr. Wiggles
Far from little, make ya mammary glands giggle
Got 'em under control, the bowl of tender biddles
Doc-tor giggles, I can't stop until it tickles
Just play a little D and I'll make ya mouth dribble
Bits and Kibbles, got 'em all after the pickle
I swing it like a bat, but these balls are not whiffle
Hit 'em in triples, wit no strikes, stripes, or whistles
I ain't felt this good, since my wood lived off a thistle
Sippin' some ripple, I got quarters, dimes, and nickels
For shizzle dizzle, I'm on a track with the
Big Snoop Dizzle
Let the Henny trickle, down the beat, wit a ghetto tempo
I done blazed the instrumental, laid it plain and simple
Getting brain in the rental, I done did it again
My eyes chinky, I'm wit Chingy, at the Holidae In
