(feat. R. Kelly)

Ba da da

CHORUS-
Baby don't you want to leave this VIP
And finish off this party in my hotel suite
Girl just follow me because I got room keys
Sex, red bull and belve, we be like

Ba da da

I pull up on the light
And i fell up in the spot
Saint louis can't talk
Tryin to find somethin hot
Drink in my hand
Hundreds in my pocket
I dont curr if he ur man
Understand im ur profit
Its 2:39, we should leave by 3
We can stroll around an go get something to eat
Outside I got a flat drop
You hungry?
Round your girls up and we can all go to ihop
You prolly think im tryna cut
And maybe you're right
You dont like one night stands?
Well baby the night
I got a presidential suite at the ritz
Errything on me? huh ain't that a hushhhhh

(chorus)
You actin like you dont hurr me
Come nurr me quick
Bacon, and take a puff of this green from jamaica
Just bought a new yacht with 4 rooms and a bar
No you're not that used to bein around a hood star
My papa told me good girls always go fast
So if I touch her right thurr ain't no need to get mad
I could take you from the club to paradise
Used to my chicks, I like them thick
Plus naughty and nice
The way you sweep me off my feet, you should be a broom
The way you smell, shoulda had ur own perfume
So knock knock, whos thurr? Jackpot (thats hot)
Ran with the old head so ?(fuck the sex)?
Do it tickle when I lick your neck?
Better get you wet
Lookin at your sexy ass make me wanna write a check

Baby don't you want to leave this VIP
And finish off this party in my hotel suite
Girl just follow me because I got room keys
Sex, red bull and belve, we be like

Ba da da

I know she like it from the back and from the front
I know you like it off the yak and on the blunt
I know you wanna ride around lets go bout the town
You know you claim of bein on top an goin down
So show a little somethin
Whisper in my ear and let me know a little somethin
You workin that body
Well throw a little something over here where im at
Girl I got too much pride to be chasin the cat
But i like how that lingerie fit
Shit, i got enough game to hit queen elizabeth
My blood blue so you know im royalty
Im through with catering to all you girls
Spoil ME

(chorus)
Now hold on the way you put it on me now
Hold on I love the way you shake it now
Hold on you drop it then you pick it up
Hold on girl you got me goin what the (whoo!)

(chorus)
