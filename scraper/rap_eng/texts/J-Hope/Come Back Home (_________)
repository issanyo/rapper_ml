[Intro: J-Hope, Jin]
Cause I'm comin' back home
난 지금 무엇을 찾으려고 애를 쓰는 걸까
난 지금 어디로 쉬지않고 흘러가는가

[Verse 1: J-Hope]
난 내 삶의 끝을 본 적이 있어
내 가슴속은 갑갑해졌어
내 삶을 막은 것은
나의 내일에 대한 두려움

[Verse 2: J-Hope]
Angry? Hungry? Yes I'm hangry
매일이 되풀이, 미랜 개뿔이
나는 없었어
그리고 또 내일조차 없었어

[Pre-Chorus 1: Rap Monster]
아직 우린 젊기에
괜찮은 미래가 있기에
자 이제 그 차가운 눈물을 닦고
Come back home

[Pre-Chorus 2: SUGA]
왜 시간을 허비해
내 피 땀들은 정직해
자 이제 그 트로피에 내 이름 박고
Come back home

[Chorus: Rap Monster, Jungkook]
You must come back home
떠나간 마음보다 따뜻한
You must come back home
거칠은 인생속에
You must come back home
떠나간 마음보다 따뜻한
You must come back home
나를 완성하겠어

[Hook: V, Jungkook]
Come back to my home, come back home
Come back to my home, come back home
(거칠은 인생속에)
Come back to my home, come back home
Come back to my home, come back home
(나를 완성하겠어)

[Verse 3: Rap Monster]
Hunnit band, hunnit band, hunnit band
가문의 영광 어머니께
또 내 식구들의 배, 터지게 부풀려주려
계속 열일해, 열일해, 열일해

[Verse 4: SUGA]
친구들, 걱정 붙들어 매
우리들 앞길이 훤해
Started from the bottom and we still going up
난 더 많은것을 원해

[Pre-Chorus 1: Rap Monster]
아직 우린 젊기에
괜찮은 미래가 있기에
자 이제 그 차가운 눈물을 닦고
Come back home

[Pre-Chorus 2: SUGA]
왜 시간을 허비해
내 피 땀들은 정직해
자 이제 그 트로피에 내 이름 박고
Come back home

[Chorus: Rap Monster, Jimin]
You must come back home
떠나간 마음보다 따뜻한
You must come back home
거칠은 인생속에
You must come back home
떠나간 마음보다 따뜻한
You must come back home
나를 완성하겠어

[Post-Chorus: Jungkook, J-Hope, Jimin]
Oh, you must come back (Yah)
You must come back (Yah)
You must come back home
(집에 돌아와)
Oh, you must come back (Yah)
You must come back (Yah)
You must come back home
(집에 돌아와)

[Refrain: Jimin]
Cause I'm comin' back home

[Chorus: Rap Monster, Jungkook]
You must come back home
떠나간 마음보다 따뜻한
You must come back home
거칠은 인생속에
You must come back home
떠나간 마음보다 따뜻한
You must come back home
나를 완성하겠어

[Hook: V, Jimin]
Come back to my home, come back home
Come back to my home, come back home
(거칠은 인생속에)
Come back to my home, come back home
Come back to my home, come back home
(나를 완성하겠어)

English Translation

[Intro: J-Hope, Jin]
Cuz' I'm comin' back home
What am I trying so hard to find now?
Where am I continuously drifting to?

[Verse 1: J-Hope]
I've seen the end of my life
I feel suffocated inside my heart
What is blocking my life is my fear towards tomorrow

[Verse 2: J-Hope]
Angry? Hungry? Yes I'm hangry
Everyday is repeating, the future is bleak
There was no me
And there was no future

[Pre-Chorus 1: Rap Monster]
Because we are still young
There is a decent future
So let’s wipe that cold tears now and
Come back home

[Pre-Chorus 2: SUGA]
Why are you wasting your time?
My blood and sweat are truthful
Now, let's imprint my name on that trophy and
Come back home

[Chorus: Rap Monster, Jungkook]
You must come back home
Warmer than my heart which has left
You must come back home
In this rough life
You must come back home
Warmer than my heart which has left
You must come back home
I will complete myself

[Hook: V, Jungkook]
Come back to my home, come back home
Come back to my home, come back home
(In this rough life)
Come back to my home, come back home
Come back to my home, come back home
(I will complete myself)

[Verse 3: Rap Monster]
Hunnit band, hunnit band, hunnit band
An honor to my family, to my mother
And to make my family get stuffed til their stomachs explode
I continuously work hard, work hard, work hard

[Verse 4: SUGA]
Friends, don't you worry
Our future path is bright
Started from the bottom and we still going up
I still want more

[Pre-Chorus 1: Rap Monster]
Because we are still young
There is a decent future
So let’s wipe that cold tears now and
Come back home

[Pre-Chorus 2: SUGA]
Why waste time
My blood and sweat speak the truth
Now, let's imprint my name on that trophy and
Come back home

[Chorus: Rap Monster, Jimin]
You must come back home
Warmer than my heart which has left
You must come back home
In this rough life
You must come back home
Warmer than my heart which has left
You must come back home
I will complete myself

[Post-Chorus: Jungkook. J-Hope, Jimin]
Oh, you must come back (Yah)
You must come back (Yah)
You must come back home
(Come back to my home)
Oh, you must come back (Yah)
You must come back (Yah)
You must come back home
(Come back to my home)

[Refrain: Jimin]
Cuz I'm comin' back home

[Chorus: Rap Monster, Jungkook]
You must come back home
Warmer than my heart which has left
You must come back home
In the rough life
You must come back home
Warmer than my heart which has left
You must come back home
I will complete myself

[Hook: V, Jimin]
Come back to my home, come back home
Come back to my home, come back home
(In this rough life)
Come back to my home, come back home
Come back to my home, come back home
(I will complete myself)
