English Translation
[Verse 1]
J-HOPE m-my name, I start putting on grease
I stop the wheel that always spins, i p-put on my worth
Gather around, I’ll show you many things, the way I cut
I cut out the rotten parts, the lice that will fall eventually
The pigeons that run away in a heartbeat, they don’t understand the meaning
I just diss them cooly, displaying, watch my talent
(WHAT)
For 2 and a half years We observed and looked on this fiery scene
It’s time for these capabilities to react, without limit
Ridicule the paparazzi, I aim for everyone’s two ears
I’ll include all my resentment, everyone listen and stay aware
REAL REAL
I don’t wear a mask, this is my motto
I live while doing what I want shit
It’s not all the same, I match with my instincts
Build my career
Only scrape the outside, I become everyone’s watermelon and to break that
I kept postponing and postponing my efforts come into fruition
Everyone’s getting impatient, brooding
This rhyme, flow have been waiting and then explode
If you call this a verse you fall immediately
I make them unable to forget, crowd around me
Even all of my fans
To the haters I make them throw up
Retributive justice, you reap what you sow
Praises make me bow
If I receive criticism
I will digest them all
I will poop it out
My ambition and pride don’t stop
I get what I want
You can‘t even go against me
Your body is below my destiny
All this bothersome phlegm, I spit it out on the ground
I gently walk on the road that my fans have made for me
You’ll feel double the effort that I have made with my brothers
Rising in the world and gaining fame
I’M ON

[Chorus]
