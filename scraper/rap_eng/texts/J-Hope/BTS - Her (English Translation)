The world is a complex
We wus lookin' for love
I was just one of those people
I did not believe what love was
I wanted to love like a habit
But I found myself
The whole new myself
I'm confused. What's really going on?
I will meet you and I will not be a book
Or did you take over my bookshelf?
Damn
Anyway, I want you the best man way
Probably because you were the world itself
If you die, you must die with me God I swore to myself
So many complex
But I'm lookin' for love
I love fake country
You are the beginning and the ending itself
You must finish me

Maybe I'm your truth and I'm lying
Maybe your love and hate
Maybe I'm your enemy
Your heaven and hell, sometimes
Proud and humiliated
I will never take off my mask
I'm not the one you know in this mask
Make up to wake up today
And dress up to mask on
To be the one you love
To become the one you love
I liked his XX too
Just for you
Excessive make-up
Your laughter and happiness is the
Measure of my happiness
Oh my darling I am deserved of your love
Always try to be your best
I did not know that

As always, mask on
Cheer me
Your only star. Shine without a thing
In the most brilliant time I have to mask off
Lost star drop my luggage and enjoy the darkness
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
Just as you go
As soon as I get it, do not get me
Tick ​​tock the dark is over
To be your best again
Grab myself
Love makes people crazy
Yeah
I will assign it to the best expression
Give me the answers I gave you for all of you
You love it
I am trying for it
A night that finds new meaning in your presence and shines
I got it. When the darkness is over
You are the morning to me
You woke me up
