English Translation

At first, I was only curious as I started to show interest in you
Holy shhh yeah, even if you ignore me
You’ll fall for me for a minute
We look good together, without you, I’m like a Seoul city without lights
I fiercely glare at your empty spot, a rabbit hole graffiti
A day without you is a one-act play of tragedy

Us meeting isn’t just coincidence
Meeting you was what I wanted
You’re a flower and I’m a bee
You’re honey and I’m a bear

Words come out as if reading a book
Seems like you resemble me somehow
You’re so pretty, I’m getting a feeling
Your charms are exploding, come give it to me

Look here, don’t run away
Look here, don’t run away
Look here, don’t run away
Because soon, you’ll want me

When you’re crying because you’re lonely, it’s already too late
I already figured out your pretty charms
Baby come on

At first, you answered once when I texted ten times
But later, you call me first and look for me all day

Look here, don’t run away
Look here, don’t run away
Look here, don’t run away
Look here

A guy like me has talent for going to you
Admit it, I ran my finances for you
Achoo, words like a sneeze, bless you
If you get bored, I’ll debut every week
I’ll go to you, what do you want?
Come with me to the sea of love
You’re a thief, I’m the police, pay for your crime
Without you, I’m a lonely city nomad
I want you

Us meeting isn’t just coincidence
Meeting you was what I wanted
You’re a flower and I’m a bee
You’re honey and I’m a bear

Words come out as if reading a book
Seems like you resemble me somehow
You’re so pretty, I’m getting a feeling
Your charms are exploding, come give it to me

Look here, don’t run away
Look here, don’t run away
Look here, don’t run away
Because soon, you’ll want me

Baby stop playing hard to get, cmon show me what you got
You sexy girl, that’s important to me
(You’re my ideal type) let’s get married
You’re featuring in my daily life
Weighing 99kg
I can’t shake you off, I hate you
I’m wishing for some luck today
You’re cute and pretty, the truth and reason
Yo my genie, Lamborghini, be my teenie weenie mini
You’re a bikini and martini, Mercedes so hot
It’s too tiring so stop that eenie menie miny
Please take me out of here
Let me switch your mind, please change
Stand over there, let me walk with ya
Sweet talk to me
Get it?
