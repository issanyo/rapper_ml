[Chorus]
내 피 땀 눈물
내 마지막 춤을
다 가져가 가
내 피 땀 눈물
내 차가운 숨을
다 가져가 가
내 피 땀 눈물
[Verse 1]
Oh can you see the devil? (oh can you see him?)
'Cause he's watching me (he's watching me)
He's got tricks up his sleeves (up his sleeves yeah)
Peaches and cream
He's luring me in
Chocolate cheeks
And chocolate wings
Oh no my heart is racing
I believe this is his win (his win)
Kiss me or I'll bleed
You're the one I need
Looks like my greed will never let me leave
The darkness is consuming me
Oh just you wait and see
[Chorus]
내 피 땀 눈물
내 마지막 춤을
다 가져가 가
내 피 땀 눈물
내 차가운 숨을
다 가져가 가
Oh love me love me love love me love me love me
Why won't you love me love love me love me love me
Why won't you love me love love me love me love me
Why won't you love me love love me love me love me
[Verse 2]
Oh I can feel a strange power rushing from my head all the way to my feet (to my feet)
I ain't one to accept this kind of love and just face defeat (face defeat)
So kiss me on the lips, lips (yeah)
Now move your hips, hips (yeah)
I know you want to submit, submit
I've never felt this kind of love before but I think I like it
[Chorus]
내 피 땀 눈물
내 마지막 춤을
다 가져가 가
내 피 땀 눈물
내 차가운 숨을
다 가져가 가
Oh love me love me love love me love me love me
Why won't you love me love love me love me love me
Why won't you love me love love me love me love me
Why won't you love me love love me love me love me
[Verse 3]
Someone help me, someone help me, I'm going numb in my brain (numb in my brain)
Someone help me, someone help me, escape this pain (escape the pain)
Someone help me, someone help me, it's just not the same (not the same)
I am done with this, let me outta here before I go insane
[Chorus]
내 피 땀 눈물 (yeah, yeah, yeah)
내 피 땀 눈물 (Josh, it's the remix)
내 피 땀 눈물 (haha)
