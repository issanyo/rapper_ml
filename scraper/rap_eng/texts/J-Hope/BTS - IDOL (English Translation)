[Verse 1: RM, J-Hope]
You can call me artist (artist)
You can call me idol (idol)
No matter what you call me
I don’t care
I’m proud of it (proud it)
I’m free (free)
No more irony (irony)
Cuz I was always just me

[Refrain 1: Suga, RM]
They point fingers at me
But I don’t care at all
Whatever the reason for your criticism is
I know what I am (I know what I am)
I know what I want (I know what I want)
I never gon’ change (I never gon' change)
I never gon’ trade
(Trade off)

[Verse 2: J-Hope, Suga]
FACE OFF, just like John Woo, ay
Top star with that spotlight, ay
Sometimes like a superhero
I'm your Anpanman
24 hours isn’t enough
Can’t afford to be confused
I do my thang (I do my thang)
I love myself (I love myself)

[Refrain 2: Jungkook, V]
I love myself, I love my fans
Love my dance and my what
There are hundreds of me’s inside of me
I’m facing a new me again today
It’s all me anyway
So instead of worrying, I’m just gonna run
Runnin’ man
Runnin’ man
Runnin’ man
