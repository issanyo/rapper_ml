[Verse 1: Jungkook]
She’s my religion, so I can call you shesus
I push aside the fact that you have no boyfriend
When you looked at me, you wrapped around my heart
A normal guy like me doesn’t fit your standards
So I wore a “friend” mask
Hiding my true feelings when I’m next to you
Sliding into the comfortable category
Always high-kicking the blanket at night in frustration
Damn you always entice me
I can’t control myself because of all of your expressions
Watching you, my head spins
Pool full of beauty and I dive in it
Girl I’m so K.O
You’re like Napoleon, conquering me in an instant
I continued to watch you
Hiding behind a friend image

[Chorus: Jimin]
You’re beautiful
Don’t we look good together
I always imagine it like this, you be with me with me

[Jungkook]
You’re beautiful
What will we be like together
I always imagine it like this, you be with me with me

[Verse 2: J-Hope]
The start was at dance class, I took interest in you after hearing rumors
But when I saw you I lost my mind, my heart is like a keyboard
Trying hard to be cool
Not giving you a single glance to protect my ego
But your words hit me like a bowling [ball]
My heart is hit by a strike like a bowling pin
Following the number exchange is an all-night texting session
My feelings for you just keep getting better than better
But I can’t figure out how you feel about me
I hear “She has a boyfriend"
I guess all girls are the same, all uniform
It’s a one-sided love but it’s still beautiful

[Chorus: Jungkook]
You’re beautiful
Don’t we look good together
I always imagine it like this, you be with me with me

[V]
You’re beautiful
What will we be like together
I always imagine it like this, you be with me with me
