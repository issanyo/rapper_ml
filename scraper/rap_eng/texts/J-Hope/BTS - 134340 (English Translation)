[Verse 1: V, Jungkook]
If only I could, I wanted to ask you
Why did you do that back then? Why did you kick me out?
Without a name to myself, I still revolve around you
Our goodbye is colorless, that unchanging color

[Verse 2: RM]
There’s no name allowed for me
I, too, used to be your star
You must feel nice to be the light
All I did was to receive you

What meaning is left of the fallen planet’s remaining life
I’ll receive it til I die, your stifling stare
I still orbit you, and nothing’s changed
If love has no name, everything has changed

Could it be really that you’ve found Eris
Tell me, how am I not as good as that moon
Us is the plural form of U
Maybe I wasn’t there from the start

Someday, you’ll also understand my words
My seasons were always you
My cold heart is 248 degrees below zero
It stopped the day you erased me
Damn

[Pre-Chorus: Jimin, Jin]
I’m just orbiting you
(I missed you, I lost you)
I’m just going in circles
(You erased me, you forgot me)

[Chorus: Jungkook, V]
I once belonged in a world under the sun
(The song paused, the song stopped)
A smoky layer of mist in the heart of the stars
(You erased me, you forgot me)

[Verse 3: Suga]
It’s not much different from yesterday ay
Same old days, except you’re not here
We were together just up until yesterday ay
But it’s to the point where it’s scary, same days but no you

I’ll be honest, even up until one year without you
I was fine, I didn’t have any feelings left
The last day I had forgotten
I don’t even remember your scent

But wait, I’ve smelled this perfume somewhere, ay
Just when my memory was about to come back
I turned my head around and saw you
You’re smiling brightly, but beside you there’s

Ah (Hello?) Hello
How are you? I’m doing okay
Unlike my heart, that feels like it’ll explode
The temperature right now is -248 degrees

[Pre-Chorus: Jin, Jungkook]
I’m just orbiting you
(I missed you, I lost you)
I’m just going in circles
(You erased me, you forgot me)

[Chorus: Jungkook, Jimin]
I once belonged in a world under the sun
(The song paused, the song stopped)
A smoky layer of mist in the heart of the stars
(You erased me, you forgot me)

[Bridge: Jin, J-Hope]
I’m just orbiting you
(Beyond the fog, I watch you as you continue to smile
Without you or anything
There’s no meaning to my irregular orbit)

I’m just going in circles
(I’m just a hard number to remember
And the Pluto of darkness
But I’ll continue to orbit around you forever, damn)

[Pre-Chorus: V, Jungkook]
I’m just orbiting you
(I missed you, I lost you)
I’m just going in circles
(You erased me, you forgot me)

[Chorus: Jungkook, Jimin]
I once belonged in a world under the sun
(The song paused, the song stopped)
A smoky layer of mist in the heart of the stars
(You erased me, you forgot me)
