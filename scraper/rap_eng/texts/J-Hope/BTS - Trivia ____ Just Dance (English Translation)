If you ask me about that moment
Bright sunshine was falling down
If you ask me about that feeling
Naturally, it was a one shot into my eyes
Music playing in those vibes
We each stretch
Getting rid of the nerves
If I hid my heart, I would’ve regretted it
Watching this sunset with you
Hey, dance with me dance with me
Any kind of bounce is fine, dance with me
Where are you from, why are you dancing
A natural conversation, say something
It’s weird, we’re connecting too much
Feels like everything will go well
But you’re my Friend, yeah my Friend
Just
I like the feeling of being with you
I like the feeling of dancing with you
I just wanna, wanna, wanna
I really wanna, wanna, wanna
Just dance

To the rhythm of the music
However our bodies move
We’re shadows underneath the moonlight
Fall in.. fall in..

I like the feeling of being with you
I like the feeling of dancing with you
I just wanna, wanna, wanna
I really wanna, wanna, wanna
Just dance

In my muddy life
You were like a single stem flower
Even this suffocating studio
If we’re together, turns into paradise
My dreams that once had no answer
Now becomes something we can relate to
Because our rhythm is matching
Because we have our dance, it’s a fate-like beat
Let’s get it on POP
Washing me over with those waves
Our heartbeats are in sync
You’re getting to know my heart too
I wanna keep this going
I like you like I like to dance
So you’re my love, yeah my love
That’s what I like

I like the feeling of being with you
I like the feeling of dancing with you
I just wanna, wanna, wanna
I really wanna, wanna, wanna
Just dance

To the rhythm of the music
However our bodies move
We’re shadows underneath the moonlight
Fall in.. fall in..

I like the feeling of being with you
I like the feeling of dancing with you
I just wanna, wanna, wanna
I really wanna, wanna, wanna
Just dance

I felt it baby
This moment, you and me, baby
This all fits together like a math formula baby
Even obscurities, baby
Even difficulties, baby
Because of you, I’m comforted from all of that, baby

I felt it baby
This moment, you and me, baby
This all fits together like a math formula baby
Even rough breathing, baby
Even shedding sweat, baby
Because of you, it all has meaning, baby

I like the feeling of being with you
I like the feeling of dancing with you
I just wanna, wanna, wanna
I really wanna, wanna, wanna
Just dance
