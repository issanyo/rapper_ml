My bro Suga. From J-Hope
Hey. It's me, Hoseok
We’ve been together 7 years, including our trainee days
When I was first at the dorm, I felt so awkward and shy
So I remained in the living room
Then you came over to talk and made me relax
I still can't forget that moment
Coming from Gwangju, you were like my savior
When I was sick or sad, you were there by me
When I was tired and had it hard, you were there to give me strength
When I got seasick on Bon Voyage 2 and opened my eyes from sleep, the first person I saw was you - though Jimin was also there
I didn't say it then, but I really appreciated your help
As much as we’ve spent time together, I'm that much grateful to you
I'd like to say that with this letter at this time
Thanks for becoming a member of BTS
And thanks for being my big brother
I hope you're always by my side
