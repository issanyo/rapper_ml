[Intro]
Dane: Hey yo, Hurb what's up?
Hurby: Dana, where you been?
Dane: Yo, the limo came late man.  I just stepped in
Hurby: Well, let's start the show.  The peoples getting upset.  Tell them what this be
Dane: Okay, Hurb, bet

[Verse 1: Dane Dane with Hurby Luv Bug]
Let this be the reason for all mankind
You're taste buds will just love a well seasoned rhyme
That I recite on the mic
Making you get hyper
Than (You've ever been)
Cause I'm Dane.  I'm on the mic again
Rapping up a storm (Oh, come on)
Yo, Hurb! (Huh?)
Tell them what what's going on

[Switch: Hurby Luv Bug with Dana Dane]
Now what we have here's
The best jam of the year
Top security for your assurity
I swear
Me and Dana is maxin hard
(Cold chilling)
If you want to flirt, flygirls
(We're willing)
Who, me?  I'm Hurby Luv Bug, word see
I've been rapping for years
But no one's heard me rhyme
Because I spend most of my time
Producing other groups, but now I'm going for mine

[Switch: Hurby Luv Bug with Dana Dane]
Now you'll dance (You'll glide)
You'll move with pride
And you don't stop moving even though you try
You won't (you can't)
You'll huff (and pant)
And "we want more" (Will be your chant)
So you wait, you hope
Wide eyed, you scope
Praying for another rhyme that's just as dope
But you're tired (waxed)
But here is the facts
Just like sex you want your climax
As sure as I'm Dana Dane With Fame
When it comes you'll know it came
Cause a sigh of satisfaction will be exhaled
And all at once you all will yell

[Hook]
Dana: "We want to party, we want to party!"
Crowd: "We want to party, we want to party!"
Dana: "I said, we want to party, we want to party!"
Crowd: "We want to party, we want to party!"

Aaaaaah, yeah
Haha
That's right.  Get down
So let's party

[Verse 2: Hurby Luv Bug with Dana Dane]
Yes, we're going to party if you like it or not
I don't care if you're tired or burning hot
Dana Dane and I came here to drop
(Dope, def) [?] rhymes on the spot
(In effect)
You can bet
Two great poets
And my man, Clark Kent on the D.J. set

[Switch: Dane Dane with Hurby Luv Bug]
Yes, we're going to party until you're out of breath
And the drum seems like it's going to beat you to death
Have you scream and holler throughout the show
(Yo, are we going to party?)
Now Hurb, you know
We'll make them dance until their legs get weak
But they'll still refuse to go grab a seat
"Party Hard" (G)
And that we will
And there'll be no reason for you to get ill
Cold drinks at the bar
Sounds up to par
And for your entertainment, we are your stars
Now I'd like to send out a call
And I want a little feedback from you all

[Hook]
Dana: "Say, we want to party, we want to party!"
Crowd: "We want to party, we want to party!"
Dana: "I said, we want to party, we want to party!"
Crowd: "We want to party, we want to party!"

[Outro]
Ooh, ooh, ooh ooh, Baby, please
Do it, do it, do it, do it
Do it to me like that
(do it, do it)
Let's party

Let's party
Yo, the party's at our hotel girls
That's right and I got the lambskins, so trust me
Cases of em
Ah, yes.  Ah, yes.  We are ready for tonight
But if you're coming with your boyfriends, we suggest you don't
That's right, leave your man home
This is a girls party
[fades out ... inaudible]
