[Verse 1]
The sounds you're about the hear coming through your speaker
Will blow you over and fry your tweeter
Get up out your seat
Give your feet a treat
And you'll understand why this be the def beat

[Interlude with talking]

[Verse 2]
Listen up patriarchs of the rapping sphere
The rapper entertainer Dana Dane is here
Now I came here just to have fun
So guys get loose and girls shake those buns
A lot of you girls what I would love to meet
And I'll check you later when my job's complete
Cause as for now I am only around
To make you party people just get on down
Cause the rhymes I write
Are fresh and ripe
And guaranteed to be just your type
Cause you the public knows who we're rhyming for
And for my rhymes I'd like than you all
Cause I've worked hard for days and nights
Just to make sure the rhymes came out right
Now that I did, you must admit
That the rhymes I wrote were the ultimate
But nevertheless I'd like to exclaim
"This Be The Def Beat" is this jam's name
Now do me a favor for me and my team
When I say "scream" would you please scream?
Scream!
(Crowed screams)
Yes, something like that, yes, yes

[Interlude with talking]

[Verse 3]
The beat is bad, getting badder
On the way up the ladder
"The Beat Is Dope" is the neighborhood chatter
You might think the record would be hard core
But I'm here to tell you it's much much more
A combination of rap, rhythm and blues
And a swinging beat that you can't refuse
Some call it slick, others say it's jammin
Clark heard the beat and said, "Yo, it's slammin!"
Crashing through your speakers like a wild stampede
With enough base to make your eardrums bleed
And just when you thought it's just a beat
The music line come in for a extra treat
It [?] on point smooth but also crisp
The producer Hurby just has that gift
Now on the microphone a voice that you can trust
Yes me, Dane, kicking it from dawn to dusk
Simply conveyed
Are the words I say
Don't ask me why, I just rhyme that way
But let's get back to the rhythm at hand
"This Be The Def Beat" is the name of this jam

[Outro with talking]
