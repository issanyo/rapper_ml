[Verse 1]
Fuck what you heard, act like you know
For the ninth time Dana Dane serves a funky flow
Oh you didn't know that I was down with the Lifestyles?
Battlecat, we flip this, he makes the track that's buck wild
People wondering where I've been, what I'm going to do now
Well I've been north and south creating a new sound
Thought I couldn't do it, huh?  Make another single?
After "Dane With Fame" you thought the Dana Dane was done
Because they say you're only as good as your last
The Diggy coming through with something new on your funky ass
Yeah, see I've been missing in action
Gone, but not forgotten
'95 Diggy Dane's go you rockin'
And you know there'll be no stopping
I got to keep the fellas hyped
And keep the honies panties dropping (oh drop those drawers honey)
With the funky hits that I'm bringing
You know I'm going to win 'cause once again I got y'all singing

[Verse 2]
I can't sleep because (the nightmares) keep messing with my head
I couldn't top my last smash hit, that's what the critics said
About the capital D-a-n-a capital D-a-n-e
I ain't worried about it though 'Cause I know I got more hits in me (that's real)
So, where do we go from here? That's what I ask myself
Sold five hundred thousand copies from the store shelf (I'm gold)
But a whack contract
Tried to hold be back
And bring me down
But you know there'll be none of that
I got to make it happen
I'm aiming for platinum
Sitting back and rolling up a fat one
Everybody spreading rumors, but I'll get the last laugh
'85 to '95 Dane still signing autographs
So suckers [?] one in your mouth
You never thought it came from Brooklyn
We cooking up the flavors of the Lifestyles
Old jams linger and persist and keep hanging
Yeah, once again I got you singing

[Verse 3]
Y'all remember how I kicked it
I ripped it
Gifted lyrics flowed like liquid
(Uh huh, Uh huh)
But now it's time I flipped it
And shifted
To that other level of the game
Yes it's me Dana Dane (Fame)
Once again on the cut
Here to fuck it up
Fort Greene Projects Brooklyn
Off the [?] [?] [?]
I'd like give shouts to
[???]
I had to bust a power move that tapes in LA
Made a plane with my man
Harry O, Little K
Yo, we hooked up and now I'm down with that clique
All the non-believers sick
Your honies riding disnick
Of the Dana (scrath) Dana
The Entertainer
The Gucci Tamer
I can't express it any plainer
For too long I had ya'll waiting and fiending
So I hit you once again fat and hard to keep you screaming
