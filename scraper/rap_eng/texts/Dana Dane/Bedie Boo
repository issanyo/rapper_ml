Bedie Boo
Used to be so cute
Now you're kinda loose
Yeah, I know the scoop
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

Now Bedie was this girl I graduated from high school with
You know, the type of girl that everybody is real cool with
She didn't smoke or drink, in fact she never ever cursed
She wore the rosary beeds and kept a Bible in her purse
Well, one day she was aligned waiting to get in a night club
Some major group was playing, and everybody was real hyped up
Now Bedie wasn't assort to go to parties of that type
And I couldn't help but wonder why she had came here tonight
Now I didn't ask any questions, I went inside and got a drink
Someone tapped me on my shoulder (Hm, who could it be?) Now let me think
I looked around, and there was Bedie, all dressed up in lace and leather
Boy, I must admit, she really had her act together

Bedie Boo
Used to be so cute
Now you're kinda loose
Yeah, I know the scoop
About you Bedie now
You're livin kinda foul
Been skeezin for a while
Until it gets around
Oh-oh-oh Bedie Boo

(Hello, remember me?) I said, "Oh yes, of course I do
You're the girl from science class that I used to sit next to"
She started givin hints like she wanted me to hit it
(Was you with it?) Well, you know.. (Yo, was you with it?) Yeah, I was with it!
I led her to this room, the door said 'V.I.P.'
Only for people with juice, and of course that meant me
I said, "Gosh, how you changed, Bedie, you sure look, different"
(But you said she was religious) I can see now that she isn't
She got on her knees and started reachin for my zipper
I sang this little song right before, you know, I did her

Bedie Boo
You used to be so cute
Now you're kinda loose
Yeah, I know the scoop
About you Bedie now
You're livin kinda foul
Been skeezin for a while
Until it gets around
Oh-oh-oh Bedie Boo
