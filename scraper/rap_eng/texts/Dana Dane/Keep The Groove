[Intro]
Keep the groove so we can dance [x3]
Keep, Keep, Keep, Keep [scratched]
Keep the groove
Keep, Keep, Keep the groove
Keep the groove so we can dance
Dance
Dance
Dance
Dance

[Verse 1]
Well I am here to show
And to let you know
How to get you party people out there on the go
See my potential is great
Soon I will own a estate
And drive a fresh Volvo with my name on the plate
Now with the rhymes I create
I guess it would be my fate
To be considered as the best at the present date
See I am only a man
Giving you what you demand
It's time to make you party people cold clap your hands
'Cause I created this flow
To make go, "Ho"
And one more thing that I think you should know
I'm hear to entrance
Also enhance
Your feeling for the art of rap so you'd want to dance
The bass drum and snare
Vibrating through the air
Has been conceived to make your party spirits flair
The music line is smooth
And guaranteed to sooth
And it's moving at a speed that we call The Groove

[Chorus]
Keep the groove
Keep, Keep, Keep the groove
Keep the groove so we can dance
Dance
Dance

[Verse 2]
Now I walk
I don't be-bop
Here to make your finger pop
Soon enough I am bound to reach to very top
Call me King
Nah, that ain't my thing
I just hope you enjoy the rap songs I sing
But what I try to maintain
As said in my name
To be the rapper entertainer Dana Dane With Fame
I execute my rhyme
Moving oh so fine
And all you need do is listen to the line
'Cause the rhymes are rough
Even call them tough
To hear them one time wouldn't be enough
'Cause the words I say
Will make you sway
And for years to come this record will play
'Cause the jam is hot
Sure to hit the spot
And to make you all groove is the only plot
So won't you bust a move
I'm sure that you will approve
And it's moving at a speed that we call The Groove

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Now be free at heart
Come on and do your part
I'm sure others will follow if you just start
I'm not hear to cause trouble
Or burst your bubble
I just want the party rocking right now on the double
Not trying to sound rude
Fierce or crude
Just trying to get your bodies into mood
'Cause we created this thump
To make the house jump
And with he help of the scratch it's sure to pump
So won't you do like me
Let your body be free
And I'm sure in a moment you will agree
That in conclusion
It was amusin'
And also had your bodies groovin'

[Chorus x2]
