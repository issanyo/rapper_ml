Dana Dane with fame

I'm Dana Dane with fame
Here to entertain
By the time I'm through you'll remember my name

[Verse 1]
Now you probably don't know it
Because I don't show it
But I'm Dana Dane, that natural born poet
The girlies adore it
The guys try to stall it
But each one of them knows I'm not going for it
They're ultra defeated
And so damn conceited
I know how females want to be treated
Their butts you massage
Their chest you caress it
Then you make love when they kiss and suggest it
It's not how you play it
Cause no words can say it
It's how you approach it, yo how you convey it
It's now how you rub it
It's just how you love it
There is no rush, don't push or shove it
You know when you've got it
When you have ??? rocked it
The girl screams out, "Loverboy don't stop it"
Now that I've said it
You all can fret it
Dana Dane told you this and don't you forget it

[Verse 2]
More than a many people I did astound
With a master rap and a different sound
Now I am established and world renowned
And no one out there can put me down
Sucker MCs they're on an ego trip
They're blabbing off with their mouths
They're running off with their lips
But they all are bound to take a fall
And all of them can kiss my ...
[Hurby]: You Dana, cool out man
[Dana]: Okay, I'll behave
But only this time y'all have been saved
Cause I came here just as simple and plain
To get on the mic and to entertain
For a few minutes I was thrown off track
But I've regained my composer and now I'm back
To give all you party people what you're waiting for
To see what def rap I have in store

[Verse 3]
I'm the rapper Dana Dane, an all time great
And I'mma give a little story just to illustrate
See I was in my house and I was all alone
I head a "brrring, brrring" on my telephone
Answered the phone, guess who was on it?
This girl they call miss [?]
She said "Hello is this the Casanova?"
I said, "Yeah baby doll", said, "won't you come on over?"
She said, "Not right now, I just got out the shower"
"Let me check you out another half an hour"
Time flew fast and I was feeling bored
I head a "knock, knock, knock" on my front door
Opened up the door guess who was there
A lighted skinned girlie with jet black hair
I said, "Hey baby doll you're right on time"
"Come on in and have a glass of wine"
I sat her on my couch, she started to chuckle
Talking about she want to wear my [?]
I rocked it once, she said, "Dana please!"
I rocked it once again, she started talking Japanese

(vocalizing)

I'm Dana Dane. I'm doing my own thing
I'm Dana Dane. Yes, I'm doing my own thing
Rocking the house

Now as she walked out the door
There's one more thing
She looking me in my face and began to sing

Dana Dane with fame
Dana Dane with fame
I'm Dana Dane with fame
Here to entertain
By the time I'm through you'll remember my name
Dana Dane with fame
