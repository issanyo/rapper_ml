Out top story for tonight is child abuse
And the effects it has on the family structure
Film at 11

[Verse 1]
Damn, every time I turn on the news
Somewhere, somehow another child is being abused
I’m confused
What kind of people do we live among?
They must be sick doing the things that’s being done
(See what I’m saying y’all)
Young children being raped and battered
Or they’re falling victim to the ratta-tat-tatter
Who protects them? Who respects them?
When their own family neglect them
It’s time we check them
(yo, check these mothers)
And let them know that we can’t have this
Type of madness
Scaring our kids for life and putting others in their casket
It’s time we made a change today
So there won’t be no more mothers to hear their child say

[Chorus]
Mommy, mommy, please don’t leave
‘Cause Chester’s got something up his sleeve
And if you leave then I can’t sleep
‘Cause Chester’s gonna put his hands on me
Mommy, mommy, please don’t leave
‘Cause Chester’s got something up his sleeve
And if you leave then I can’t sleep
‘Cause Chester’s gonna put his hands on me

[Verse 2]
Now, A mother cries, slumped over a dead body
A teenage girl in the corner screams
“I’m sorry mommy”
Her mother wants to know one thing, Why?
Here’s the words of a girl too scared to lie
She said, “It happened to me first when I was nine
He burst in my room and told me I was fine
He sat me on his knee and said that he loved me
And in his dirty strange ways, he touched me
That night you worked late at Macy’s
Mom I prayed that you would come home and save me
Cause he did these things, these nasty things to me, Ma
These things, these nasty things
And I thought I would die from the pain
It was crazy”, the young girl explained
“When he was through with me he looked down and said
You tell anyone, your mom and you, you’re dead”
She feared for their lives so she stayed quiet
Five years of being raped and being silent
1,825 days she suffered
From a man who says I do this because I love ya
Now she’s 14 and can’t take no more
And she knew he kept a gun in his dresser drawer
So she got it, she saw him, she cocked it
She said I hate you Uncle Chester, that’s why I got to stop it

[Chorus]
Who protects our children
From the grownups touchy feeling?
Now what kind of world do we live in
When you abuse our children?

Mommy, mommy, please don’t leave
‘Cause Chester’s got something up his sleeve
And if you leave then I can’t sleep
‘Cause Chester’s gonna put his hands on me
Mommy, mommy, please don’t leave
‘Cause Chester’s got something up his sleeve
And if you leave then I can’t sleep
‘Cause Chester’s gonna put his hands on me

[Verse 2]
Now, who protects our children
From the grownups and their touchy feeling?
Do we let our kids kill or someone kill them?
Parents don’t be blind to a developing young mind
Guiding starts at home and I’m going teach mine
Hey young world, I know it’s crazy out there
I know they’re bigger and stronger and they get you really scared
But you have to find someone that you can trust
So they can help you put an end to this madness
You are not alone no matter what people have told ya
Many have been abused from the unknown to Oprah
Now what I’m saying is let’s make a change today
So you won’t be the next to hear your child say

[Chorus] [Repeats]
God bless our children
