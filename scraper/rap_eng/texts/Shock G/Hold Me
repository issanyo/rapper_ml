[Chorus]
Hold me, love me
Give me all that you got
Tell me, truly
Can I get in the right spot?

[Verse 1]
For so long I've waited for you to come and love me
Don't waste my time
'Cause I need you to let me know if you want me to
Do the things to you that no other can do
(I want you too)
I want you bad, and I won't lie
And I can't deny that I want you tonight

[Chorus]
Hold me, love me
Give me all that you got
(Give me all that you got)
Tell me, truly
Can I get in the right spot?

[Verse 2]
I wonder what is it that turns me on when I'm next to you
Can't figure out why I want you
Is it lust or love? Either one will do
'Cause I want you for myself and nobody else
(Take the place of you)
Right now 'cause it is on
So unplug the phone, 'cause I want you to hold me

[Chorus]
Hold me, love me
Give me all that you got
(Give me all that you got)
Tell me, truly
Can I get in the right spot?
Hold me, love me
Give me all that you got
(Give me all that you got)
Tell me, truly
Can I get in the right spot?
(Can I get into your spot, baby?)

[Bridge]
Oh baby, you drive me crazy
Put your arms around me, baby
And hold me now
That's what I wanna do (All that what I wanna do)
Right now, baby
I want you to hold me

[Chorus]
Hold me, love me
Give me all that you got
Tell me, truly
Can I get in the right spot?
Hold me, love me
Give me all that you got...
