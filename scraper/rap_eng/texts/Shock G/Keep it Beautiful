[Hook]
Stop actin' like a, you scared, I ain't neva scared
Got the drop on you now, yeah that man's dead
Make my grandmother cry, make anotha judge happy now
Send my ass away, little babies got no daddy now
Everybody is a punk, everyone's a killa too
Nuff keepin' it real, we can still keep it beautiful
Nuff keepin' it real, we can still keep it beautiful
Nuff keepin' it real, we can still keep it beautiful

His special special gift was his love side
So many try'na be Pac but only cop the thug side
How come yall don't wanna be Shock? I survived
And I ride for everyone
It's what you make it, so I made mine fun
Yeah it's bad now, don't make it worse
You wanna be happy? set that energy in motion and offer a smile first
They don't get it? try it again, breathe baby, breathe
You really wanna be like Pac? read shorty, read
Dear God, I'm sorry but we're way off track
Savages, and human beings are the only animals that act like that
This whole planet needs a hug, let's give it her
You fix you, I'll fix me, let's stop screwing her
'Cause I get around a lot and everywhere I see confused eyes
It's like everybody's fighting back a huge cry
Congratulations, we fucked the world, we did it
All these leaders and politicians are lost, admit it
Compassion is the only way that we're gonna make it now
So forgive me, but I'mma be that rapper still wearin' a smile
Peace is what we need
- Whaddaya mean we're not eating? We're overweight
But if you're hungry, eat from my plate, it's nothing -
Yo Keith..

[Keith Porter]
Real, the way that I feel, woah, oh, it's so real
It's so real, so real, so real, so real
- Don't kill'em, that's your brother
Don't kill'em, that's your brother -
Real, the way that I feel, Lord knows
Woah, it's so real
Not yet, not yet, not yet
