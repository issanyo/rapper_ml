What is life? It’s a balance between joy and pain, like how you need the sun and rain to make a rainbow, unlike rain though, there’s no telling where it’d go, it’s like you’ve got a boat that’s having trouble staying afloat, outta luck and outta hope, but then you feel love, it’s like you feel the flames of hell, then see the skies open up, and a hand grabs you from above, but while you feel that you could be the others side bitch, an escape from a main chick, a thrill with a risk to inflict, some pain, to leave a stain on the brain, dogs like this are in every place, it’s all the same, like wanting to be rich but hating the fame, but you gotta play properly when you play this game, rules are bullshit, and they may drive you insane, fueling warm hearts with hate and rage, plus the feeling of worthlessness, leaving me wondering is it worth this stress, like a blur in a frame of perfectness, this may drive people to join a gang, till a gun goes bang and they just fade away, but as I said it’s a balance, it’s all a challenge, impossible chances at quick glances, although you always have to face the music, embrace it and dance, struggles are important to learn from and advance, life is shit right now, why do you think I sit and take the time to write these raps, to educate the youth of the future, I don’t have to teach them all, I just wanna reach a few, that’s my goals
