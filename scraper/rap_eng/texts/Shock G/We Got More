Mammy zammy damn there's nothin to me
But when they rock us in the streets we say "Ooo we"
You see the freak in the beat she do me
I hit that mitty bitty wit the sticky ooo we gooy
I got more funk in my left in my left pinky toe
I got more soul in my style
Then they will ever know
I got more rhythm than I'll ever need to show
We got them groceries bro
Yo Luniz let go

I got the flow so let the Luni man take over
Get deep into my hold
If ya lost, then picture gold
I heard styles that others stole
But it's no original flow
Like the Luniz an the man wit the nose

Notice my flows kick like a loaded Mac-11
Ghetto heavy, could climb wit mo "Good Times" than James Devin
Glock wars
Meanin you critize 2Pac for
Homies in the hood, we strap Rugers an "We Got More"

Didn't ya know
Our brothas got more
So check the new flow
'Cause here we go-e-o-we-oh
Look how we throw
A lil sumpthin to roll to
Hold you, from the O-we-O-we-O

I got that Voodoo runnin through my veins
Quit
Suppressed yes
Crazy no
Not insane
I smoothie through the menu then I make my order
I got that dominate gene
So if ya 'noid hide yo daughter
The love ya givin is based on what I do for you
For the right amount of money you probably let me ??? you
I like to glide up in it, but I got my pride
Ain't no whore
Don't second guess yo man 'cause he got more

Studio gangstas want to battle, well let's battle
I blasted
They plastic ass get put under ground wit the fragments

Snaggle tooth rhymers wit no flavor
Save a gang a neighbors
Then move away so they won't be called haters

Captain Save-A-Hoe
Up-up an away ya go
The "O" is too unfadeable

But don't trip
Get a grip
Make ya own skit
Be sure
Before
You slide through the door 'cause "We Got More"

Didn't ya know
Our brothas got more
So check the new flow
'Cause here we go-e-o-we-oh
Look how we throw
A lil sumpthin to roll to
Bump hoes to
From the O-we-O-we-O
