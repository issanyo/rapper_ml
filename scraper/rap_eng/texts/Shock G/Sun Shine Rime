[Intro: Shock G]
Now each one teach one, life flow grows
Sun shines through one, true ones glow
Third eye no die, see long time
Long run one ton sunshine rime

[Hook: Shock G](Delina Dream)
Drink from the cup of a tribe that shines
And (we shine long time)
We glide in the light, and the night's just right
For (a sun shine rime)

[Verse 1: Shock G]
Now each one teach wise man told ya
No hurry, no worry about the overexposure
Bathe in the light freely is the answer
Sunscreen no need, we opposite cancer
Humpty dancer three left stain
Little did ya know we was down like that man
And my brain's unfrozen son
Thanks to the chosen one
P.A.C. left me the keys
To the L. I. G. H. T
You T.O.O., not just Shock G
Pardon me while I SHhh.I.N.E. on thee
Be all you can be be, graduate
Change fate to obtain the degree
Hustlin', rime'n, crime'n, it all counts
Valid in this life is degree from the street
Purposely I didn't say grinding
Demon in the substance takes man down
First makes man smile, then makes frown
Substance takes man down low
Home or another set, animal or object
Give to everything respect. Yes
Purpose of the life is to not live foul
Shock sun rime done, Mo rime now

[Mo]
I breathe it and sleep it, I dream it and see it
You can't tell me that I'll never achieve it
First, one believes it, then makes you repeat it
Every predicted defeat is the fuel I needed

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Mo]
Check, yo
Shock drops top game, Mo come hot flame
Hit block harder than rock cocaine
Got no shame in anything that I do
Right or wrong guarantee that my words b true
Worry free's hard to be when your thoughts are filthy
Mind is grimey, false streets that built me
Yeah, boulevards are dark, so I walk blinded
Guided by the light in my heart
Wise work smarter, dumb man work harder
And lazy man steady say why bother
I'm not a scholar but I watch life unfold
Like last dollar in a pocket.. "Woahhh!"
Drop cash fast and expect get broke
Treat life like sex, sometimes take slow
Make money, save money, watch money grow
Get in fight with bank account, leave it on swole
Mo's one ton sunshine rime now done
Outcome: You take game now run
Outcome: You take game now run
Outcome: You take game now run
Outcome: You take game now run
