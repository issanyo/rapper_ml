We'd like to ask now that all passengers please hold your breath
As we take you through an underwater hip hop extravaganza
We're now desending, we're two hundred fathoms and now deep
We're four hundred fathoms, we have arrived
Now last night, underwater, I saw a French mermaid
Treated her to caviar and wine over shrimp brain
In the raw, on the ocean floor, need I say more?
You never heard nobody kick it like this before
Pink champagne, octopus brains
Saw your DJ underwater through the window pane
That sucker tried to hit a mix, but the mix didn't happen
Records kept floatin' all the fish kept laughin'
A blowfish blew my mind and started to rhyme
As the octopus cut nine records at a time
Your boy said, "Show me how to keep my records down"
But the shark ate his amp, your boy got clowned
The rhymes he say have no particular order
The sheriff's after me for what I did to his daughter
Go 'head bite his rhymes if you think that you oughtta
Hold your breath, M C's, my rime's underwater
Underwater rimes
Underwater rimes
Underwater rimes
Underwater rimes
I tried to mix a cut from a TV blooper
Got pulled by a deep sea state trooper
Told me that I didn't have the right to bite
I said, "Your wife looks just like a fat blue grouper"
Sittin' in my aqua blue jail cell, didn't have my bail
I had to break out with the rhyme
Shrimp scatter on a platter, I rock like a mobster
Told an MC, "Yo, you look like a lobster"
Qualified to wreck your mind, I get busy one time
Like fish on a dish, you getting served with the rhyme
Kick the jam in the crowd if you need a fo' instance
Watch the people stop, they don't want to miss this
I'm tweakin' your speakers and I'm makin' no sense
'Cause on your turns, this record burns like incense
The rhymes he say have no particular order
The sheriff's after me for what I did to his daughter
Go 'head bite his rhymes if you think that you oughtta
Hold your breath, M C's, my rhyme's underwater
Underwater rimes
Underwater rimes
Underwater rimes
Underwater rimes
Underwater rimes
Underwater rimes
Uh, 1, 2, 1, 2, check , 1, 2, 1, 2, they call me MC blowfish
We're gonna do a little something like this
Well I'm a deep sea gangster, underwater prankster
Kissin' all the girl fish, dissin' all the sangsters
Because I blew your mind and started to rhyme
Doesn't mean that we're cool, 'cause you'll be back next time
With a hook and a line, so you can hear that fryin' sound
I'm tellin' you I'm down
I'll spin your boat around, leave suckers lost in the bay
You wanna play? I'll hook your line to a stingray
Get out of here with that boat and a stick
Get out of line, I'll call my homey Moby Dick
I'm not thinkin' 'bout dyin', fool, stop tryin' to test me
People fishin' don't catch me
And when you get home, sad 'cause you missed
Just remember MC blowfish
And you don't stop, oh yeah
Uh oh, here comes that stupid shark again
I guess I better blow up
