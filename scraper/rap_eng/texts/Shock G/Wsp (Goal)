[Verse 1]

Listen , if life was so easy and sleasy it would be pleasing to me to be so freely free from all the lies and the schemes / Who pretending to be / the best they can be / but shit whats the birds and the bees / gotta couple tricks up the sleeve / yall change like seasons on me from snow to the leaves / I leave you with this / Why the only way to getting rich is by kissing some dicks ? / I bare witness /full equipping / this my verbal health / my mental wealth / I found my inner self with a tree and belt / yall doing the "mans" metal kelt / that kept you lock on knees trying to ease the pain , from whips and chains / May Rihanna sang / and as June as my jig is up / I'll leave with some knowledge in cup / wassup ? / young black boy tryna get his weight up / payback his fam when he get some true paper / wheres my lightsaber ? /I need to slice up some muthfucking haters / boutta educate'cha / A + B = C / which means A is the shemes who are trying to vex me

WASSUP !?!

[Verse 2]

I finally found the fountain of youth / can you feel it ? / This is the energy its new / are we winning ? /grinning , my soul done tending / our minds our bending / giving you a chance / to give you this chill ass chance / to prance and dance and laugh / I get to cutting the ass / of any nigga who trash / listen , who in the kitchen making a mess ? / who said a sensei couldn't be a chef ? / stress off my chest / making the right moves in lifes game of chess / from the east to the west / let my shit sound if I was a giant , i'm bound to shake the ground / but shit /  just a six foot bandit / tryna man my own ship / i'm telling you now ! / I could give TWO fucks about your clique / keep it listed / i'm insisting while assisting the era / cause I keep it progressive / when i'm inside your ear / thats aggressive / yall niggas some real fucking peasants
