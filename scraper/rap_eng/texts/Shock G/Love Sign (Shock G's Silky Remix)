[Intro]
(We don't stop)
Love sign
Love, love

[Chorus]
If you are sick of evil knocking on your door
Throw up the love sign once and forever more
If you would rather make love and have a little fun
Throw up the love sign everybody and not the gun

[Verse 1]
In a chariot of red and gold
The cool, fuzzy voice said, "Come save your soul"
Before the fear of rejection reared its head
He stood before the masses and calmly said

[Chorus]
If you are sick of evil knocking on your door
Throw up the love sign once and forever more
If you would rather make love and have a little fun
Throw up the love sign everybody and not the gun

[Verse 2]
In the day of where and why we all belong
Don't nobody want to hear a silly love song
And if they did then we would sing it on the news
While you are aiming your gun at me and I'm aiming back at you

[Chorus]
If you are sick of evil knocking on your door
Throw up the love sign once and forever more
If you would rather make love and have a little fun
Throw up the love sign everybody and not the gun

[Ad Lib]
Now
Song now
Everybody sing the song now

[Verse 3]
If you only had one year left to live
What good is the time you spend if you got no love to give?
Let's all get up off the front and find a cause to back
Then we can teach the babies replications of the act, of the act

[Chorus]
If you are sick of evil knocking on your door
Throw up the love sign once and forever more
If you would rather make love and have a little fun
Throw up the love sign everybody and not the gun
If you are sick of evil knocking on your door
Throw up the love sign once and forever more
If you would rather make love and have a little fun
Throw up the love sign everybody and not the gun

[Outro]
(Sick of evil knocking, yeah)
(Then ev..everybody, oh)
(We can have a little fun)
(Everybody, oh yeah)
(Oh yeah)
(forever more)
(Make a little love now)
(We can make love instead of guns, oh)
Now
