[Intro: 2Pac & (Shock G)]
Ah yeah
(Round and round, round they go)
I get around
Still clown with the Underground, when we come around
(Round and round, round they go)
(Around and round, round they go)
Stronger than ever
(Round and round, round they go)

[Verse 1: 2Pac]
Back to get wrecked, all respect
To those who break their neck to keep their hoes in check
‘Cause, oh, they sweat a brother majorly
And I don't know why your girl keeps pagin' me
She tell me that she needs me, cries when she leaves me
And every time she sees me, she squeeze me—lady, take it easy!
Hate to sound sleazy, but tease me
I don't want it if it's that easy
Ayo, bust it, baby got a problem saying "bye-bye"
Just another hazard of a fly guy
You ask "Why?", don't matter, my pockets got fatter
Now everybody's lookin' for the latter
And ain't no need in being greedy, if you wanna see me
Dial the beeper number, baby, when you need me
And I'll be there in a jiffy
Don't be picky, just be happy with this quickie
When will ya learn you can't tie me down
Baby doll, check it out: I get around

[Chorus: 2Pac & (Shock G)]
(Round and round, around they go)
2Pacalypse now don't stop for hoes
(Round and round, round they go)
I get around
(Round and round, round they go)
(Round and round, round they go)
Why I ain't call you? Hahaha, please...

[Verse 2: 2Pac]
Fingertips on the hips as I dip
Gotta get a tight grip, don't slip; loose lips sink ships
It's a trip, I love the way she licks her lips, see me jockin'
Put a little twist in her hips ‘cause I'm watchin'
Conversations on the phone 'til the break of dawn
Now we're all alone, why the lights on?
Turn them off! Time to set it off, get you wet and soft
Somethin' is on your mind, let it off
You don't know me, you just met me, you won't let me
Well, if I couldn't have it (silly rabbit) why you sweatin' me?
It's a lot of real G's doin' time
Cause a groupie bent the truth and told a lie
You picked the wrong guy, baby, if you're too fly
You need to hit the door, search for a new guy
'Cause I only got one night in town
Break out or be clowned, baby doll are you down?
I get around

[Chorus: 2Pac & (Shock G)]
What you mean you don't know?
(Round and round, around they go)
Check it, check it, I get around
The Underground just don't stop for hoes
(Round and round, around they go)
I get around, still down with the Underground
(Round and round, around they go)
I get around, yeah, ayo Shock, let them hoes know
(Round and round, around we go)

[Verse 3: Shock G & (Money B)]
Now you can tell from my everyday fits I ain't rich
So cease and desist with them tricks (tricks)
I'm just another black man caught up in the mix (mix)
Tryna make a dollar out of 15 cents (a dime and a nickel)
Just cause I'm a freak don't mean that we could hit the sheets
Baby, I can see, that you don't recognize me
I'm Shock G, the one who put the satin on your panties
Never knew a hooker that could share me; I get around

[Verse 4: 2Pac]
Round and round, the Town we go
But the Underground just don't stop for hoes
What do ya know? Another young bro making dough
But the po-po won't let me go, tryna do my show
But other young bros wanna throw
Time to hit the do', grab a hoe
Don't forget my dough, and if the promo say "no"
Let 'em meet my 4-4, I'm from the O
And yo, I get around

[Outro: Shock G]
Round and round, around we go
Round and round, around we go, uhh
Round and round, around we go
Round and round, around we go
Round and round, round we go
Round and round, round we go
Round and round, round we go
Round and round we go...
