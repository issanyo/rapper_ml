Chorus x1
Now when I die, die if I die
Remember me ballin'...ballin'
Now when I die
Mama don't you cry
Just remember me ballin'...ballin'
Now when I die nigga don't you cry
Just remember me ballin'...ballin'
(born to die)

[Indo G]
Fresh out the womb, 1973
A baby boy, I'm ready for war
Now this just can't be
Wit my daddy
He don't love us, just too young to know
I love you mama, work real hard
It got us out the ghetto
No more dependin' on my mama
See I'm a cra... man
And I got kids of my own
But if I call she there
Somehow, someway
Indo gone shine like diamonds
Immortalize to my rise dodgin' demons and phantoms
Realize your situation, ain't gettin' no better
They building more and more prisons
I wrote my nation a letter
Conversation and hation
I talked to god last night
Like from last saw 6 phantom
And I'ma lie in twilight
Zonin', think I'm gonin'
Maybe bro hoe
Was I talkin' on that level
Crucifix on my door
Race em', rece em', racin'
Got my heart pacin'
Listen learn it's my turn
I'd a free mase em'

Chorus x1

[Gangsta Boo]
The late generation 6
Never caught up in clicks
How can you haters
Claim you real
Turn in (??)
But anyway that stories old
Let me kick in the loot
I'm tellin' heavy understand me, baby this Gangsta Boo
Now all you wannabe's
Claimin' platinum LP's
I can't believe all you fakers in the rap industry
You stay at home at your moms house
Stackin' your cheese
Whatever punk, I'm on my own
Still stackin' g's
I'm young in ages
Only the hair trick, I've been everywhere
I'm takin' flights to NY
Lookin' for somethin' to wear
I don't be carin' what you say
I'm hypnotized for your mind
I state it fly
Sippin' wine
Wit my 6's behind
Call up Chris
I'm in crystal
What you got for me baby
Me and Paul comin' over
Range Rover we're reelin'
X-O through the door
Cause we got plenty more
We be the one with the flow
Hurtin' all I fall

Chorus x1

[Indo G]
Triggas bleed the same blood
We killin' each other for colors and lovers and others
We can talk a long time
Smoke a blunt and touch faces
Rull laces, talk, pimp, and no slippin' and take it
To upper places
Like do you have a strong mind
What's your purpose in life
Begin it to end in my potion, I'm steady coastin'
Bustas look me in my eye
Turn around and throw crosses
Talkin' shit, your jealous bustas come and go like my (??)
Toss and turn, and burn and yurnin' for freedom in my sleep
I'm bout' to lose my mind
But them angels watchin' over me
Three strikes and now your gone
To the penetentiary
Word is bond, they won't capture me
I'm on a mission, I'm wishin'
Up on a star
Workin' on a meal ticket
While I'm eatin' caviar
I lie please
Bless my soul on my journey through hell
I know my bothers my keeper
My brother got a street sweeper
We gonna blast these devils
I know you comin' to get me
But when I die, I'm takin' six of ya'll wit me
Killuminati
I got my soldiers
And I'm ready for war
Check mate, Rockefeller
Now they jumpin' in the door

Chorus x1
