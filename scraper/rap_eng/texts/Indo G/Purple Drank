[Intro]
Get yo' Sprite, get yo' Jolly Ranchers
Get yo' drank, nigga
Mix it with a little yellow, yeah, with the 'zine, nigga
Get yo' lean on, boy
Uh huh, uh huh

We go like Hollywood, off with that purple stuff
Then a [?] rollin' it up, hydro with a [?] nut
Then I bust 'bout four, five 'nuts
In her mouth, while I'm sipping on what?
Purple drank, with some yellow mixed in
Got me moving in slow motion

I'm a P-R-O on the drank
I'm a P-R-O on the dank
Haters try to hold me back but they can't
[?] four-five in the bank

In the bank, hydrocodone, Percocet [?]
X pills, Xanax boy, if you got them [?]
But I call it Frankenstein, 'cause I took it from the morgue
Transport down to Tex, 'cause them niggas payin' for it

Transport, purple, yellow
Do my shit like acapella
[?]
Troopers hit me with the scanner
Keep my cool, keep my pace
Seatbelt on, don't hit my brakes
Call they bluff, pass me up
Like OJ Simp in a big white truck

[?], bricks, mirrors Alaskan snow
Slam my Cadillac door, get your ass knocked down to the floor
Put your money where your mouth is
So you wanna be on my team, break bread
So you wanna be [?]
So you wanna be a ho, then, go ahead, be a ho

[Chorus]
Purple drank, purple drank
(Purple drank, purple drank, purple drank, purple drank)
Purple drank, purple drank
(Purple drank, purple drank, purple drank, purple drank)
Purple drank, purple drank
(Purple drank, purple drank, purple drank, purple drank)
Only want to see you sippin' on that purple drank

[Verse 2]
Put the purple in the Sprite, with the Jolly Ranchers
And pop a Xanax, got a nigga fucked up
XDGB, my nigga, he leaned out
Smoke a hydro blunt, burned down the whole house

And my nigga Kilo, he towed his Taho, [?]
RIP to my nigga [?] and all them other niggas who died from sippin' too
Much of the yellow and purple and pill poppers
Xanny bar, promethazine and oxycontin
Purple in my blunt, purple in my cup
With the yellow mixed in, got me seein' purple stuff
Like Prince in my backseat puffin' on a sweet whole of [?]
Hey, nigga, hey, sip sip [?] purple cup in my hand

[Chorus]
