[Sample]
"You better not try and change it, oooooh"

[Verse: Lil' Blunt]
Here's something for the brothers that can flow
And go where the P.O.L.I.C.E. don't grow
A place where the brother C.L.V. is smoking chicken
But when they smoking that chicken then their nines start to clicking
So yo withstand from the drama yo here's something for yo' mama
Can't tell you what to do or not do, do what you wanna
Don't worry about creeping just chiefing on a half
The only time a brother shuts up thinking, won't care
This type of chilling mode will make a person wonder
If this was an everyday thing a lot of people wouldn't be under
So I'm legit, keep myself from having fits
Stay calm, feeling numb with a fat philly blunt lit
Now I'm feeling straight, falling back
Bottom's up, smoke a sack
Conjac is on the deck
In my lap's a twelve pack
Now you tell Blunt how he living
Don't have a worry in the world
I'm chilling like a villain

[Verse Two: Indo G]
Yeah I just keep on kicking lyrics from the one into the two
Clocking, jocking make them duckets, not just me but the whole crew
So just sit back and relax and let the rhythm cold take over
Moving and grooving the party people, taking 'em to a higher level
Yo try to C.L.V. take it from me boy I'm gon' tell ya
You ask me what it is, just shut the fuck up I'ma tell ya
To see if you don't know you must be smoking, 'C' standings for 'Chilling'
The L it stands for 'Like A' and the 'V' it stands for 'Villain'
There ya have it I'm chilling like a villain, don't try to take the broken beat
The first one to jump up the first one to catch a clip in ya butt bro
I'm doing the kind of music girlies love to freak to
Bringing the bass and kicking it with the brothers in my crew
Making the tape but bullets will break a sucker [?]
Stabbing and capping, flipping and flapping, yep I shut your lip up
If you're chilling, where you go? The liquor sto'? Texaco?
Get a 40 or a six pack that's the only way to G.O
P me up I like [?] hot
Culture got the [?] liquor
Give me a brew, ya ask for four big girls cause I'm all for down with chilling
When I down a fourth I know it makes me wanna chill
My other brothers drank it and it makes them wanna kill
Hey man that ain't the subject for right now cause I'm top billing
I won't give up, no not tonight cause I'm just chilling
I'm chilling like a villain
