Get it planned what you pay
Gon' break 'em off
Post up with decay
Gon' break 'em off
Let 'em know who da boss
Gon' break 'em off
Now leakin' hot sauce

[Verse 1: Lord Infamous]
BLAY!
Standin' in the acid rain
Skin meltin' off my face, you can see my veins
Clothes hanger up his nose, pull out some brain
Rap the .45 through his teeth - chitty bang bang
Niggas meltin' like salt poured on a snail
Slice your pupils, have your bitch ass needin' braille
Eat a sack lunch in a fuckin' whole sale
Pay my lawyer with cocaine and post a damn bail
I'm Lord Infamous the villain, come with me to hell
Break down the Thrax and snort me a wicked rail
Pulled up with my playa partner pumpin' pistol grip
Erase the whole strip, walkin' with a gangsta limp
Don't make me trip
Run up with the Mossberg, heads tossed on the curb
Bitch don't you say a word, this shit can get absurd
Run up with the Mossberg, heads tossed on the curb
Bitch don't you say a word, get your fuckin' face blurred

[Verse 2: Indo G]
(?) how kids washin' 'em with these ways
I ain't talkin' 'bout no chicken
The Chinese get me explained
Framed like I'm Hussein
I'm a bad ass mane
They scared to see me shine
Now that's some goddamn shame
I'm a full grown pit
You boys is like chihuahua
Me and the Chinese boys fight
You gon' get ate, slaughter
Like Texas Chainsaw Massacre nigga
Breakin' the best in the game
But I took a chill pill
Stackin' my figures
Boy it's hard in these streets
Knee-deep up in this game
If I don't hustle; I don't eat
Can't front you nothin' mane
The fuckin' snow
Bitch the show must go on
Wrong place, right time
Do or die 'bout me and mine
Crime pays, ounces, pounds, bricks
Niggas catchin' cases
Over the phone, leavin' traces
All up in yo fuckin' matrix
Watchin' nigga, watchin' bitch
And watchin' blood
When shit hit the fan
It's just you and fuckin' judge dummy

[Hook: Indo G] 2x
Get it planned what you pay
Gon' break 'em off
Post up with decay
Gon' break 'em off
Let 'em know who da boss
Gon' break 'em off
Now leakin' hot sauce
