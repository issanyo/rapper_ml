(DJ Paul)
Yeah, we back up in this mothafucka
Prophet motherfuckin' Posse ho
Three 6 mafia, M-Child
A whole bunch of mothafuckas
And ready to do this shit
You wanna fuck a ho
Then Wait until you're back
When the war's gone bitch
You better recognize you motherfuckin' suckas
Thinkin' that I'm for the 9-7
Once again, it's on
Bout to pull yo' motherfuckin' ass in bitch
Woow, woow, woow woow woow woo

(DJ Paul)
Now when it comes to my hood
I be like blackhaven zone
Now when it comes to parts of the body
I got more than Autozone
In the middle of fashion I got to keep it like rockin'
It be Bacardi and green this cocaine got my jaw lockin'
Let's get this ??? in here I need to let some shots off
It's Dj Paul with Teflon on so take that bulletproof off
When they jump, I pump and put some iron in the punk
And then I dumped all his bodyparts into my trunk

(Lord Infamous)
Play
I'm terror from The End
I'm watching your body explode
Every time that I blast
I'm thinking about two holes on them bloody clothes
Kill 'em though, Don't you know
I want to get rid of them faked up hoes
It's the city of Memphis
Watch me witness how the scarecrow unload
Rage make me regularly, force me blood
I feed ya' hot lead slugs and watch you drip like fudge
I'm nuts
You got no crips
You got no heart
You niggas front from the start
I want to fill my fucking backyard with your body parts

(Gangsta Boo)
Wussup mista trick
Do you wanna get with this
Pimp type ass bitch down with the Triple 6
My Lexus trunk or Viper
Prophet Posse nothin' nicer
In his fuckin' body parts to we add more spicer
Cause we come to get it crunk
Several bodies in my trunk
Never denyin', always high
Fuck you playa hatin' punks
Always stayin' on the top
Look at the Billboard Charts
Prophet Posse takin' over
Nigga now we got you hot

(M-Child)
I don't know you
Why the fuck you all in my grill
Must i get buck on you niggas, say you so so trill
You ain't no killa
My niggas leave a schedule
Go to sleep
Sleepin' with the lights on, ho, you cautious of me
Me and about 80 more motherfuckers who coming
Four and five vans deep while your bitch ass running
We be the Prophet definition meaning click so tight
M-Child, Orange Mound, smoking out every night, BITCH!!!!

(Juicy J)
I met this fool last week
Who said he slangin' nothing but keys
Also had a hook up on some tones and some light green ink
What you think
I was tryin' to plan a robbin' spree
So I drove a low key car
Tryin' to fool the streets
Curve after curve
I turn tryin' not to swerve
Knowin' by the hour I be choppin' up my bag of herbs
Mossberg pure herb AK's all kinds a guns
Till the nigga pulled his car to the side and start to run

(Scanman)
Please don't test these murderers
Slugs I will pump at your gut
Scan from the Killa Klan Kaze
I will dump your bodyparts into my trunk
Let's go ride then play a game
What's the game
The game of names
Now which, which one would you choose
Which ever you choose you lose, you lose

(Droopy Drew Dog)
First time on the mic, so I'ma come real, trick
You see them hatas talk shit but they don't know the deal
Dope sella
BHZ's where I dwell-ah
They looked into the barrel of my chin black Barretta
Ratta Tatta is all you heard
To see you niggas comin' up and they want to splurge
But watch the game
Cause you don't got no friends
Droopy Drew Dog self made to the end

(Crunchy Black)
Check this here
Niggas will, rob and steal, mob and kill
And it feel
They don't feel
What I feel, then I fill
Them up with
Bullet lead two to the head
Then I lay them in graves
That I dig
Just for them
Yes it is

(Project Pat)
Slammin' bones, throwin' licks
Puttin' bitches in there clicks
Kaze in this motherfucker
Down with the Prophet click
Clack boom doom for you hatas hatin' realness
Mossberg slug to your grill
You gone feel this
Trigger happy, nappy headed, sell that dope you sent me
Project Pat is down
But ain't no fuckin' damn fool
We riding, chiefing, dranking, bodies stanking, I can smell it well
And if the police pull us over I'm the first to bail

(Indo G)
Jackin' and packin', attackin' those fakin' ass bitches
That think they some thing, I know they so broke
I'm leaving them red instead
While I chop this track up like i'm Freddy
Straight from very bone
Til a motherfucka fall out on his face
See Triple 6, It's on
Bitch every month up in the source bar
I don't wanna kill a motherfucker
Betta get a motherfucker for talkin' that shit
Huh, I don't wanna kill a motherfucker
Betta get a motherfucker for crossin' my click bitch
Boogety boogety bang bang nigga blew your brains
On the motherfuckin' wood grain nigga
Pullin' the trigga like uhh die nigga uhh die nigga

(K-Rock)
Motherfucker, I'm K-Rock
I dump them body parts into my trunk
See me after Killa Klan
See when that K-Rock solo bump
Wakin' up in my dream
Prophet Posse my niggas
Gimme that forty Glock
In my pajamas pullin' that trigga
I see traitors, stupid-ass player haters
Faking while we blast our gat
I don't know your ass
Therefore, automatic weapons commence to blast
If a nigga don't believe me, trick afraid in front of that car
To that ditch
I dumped all his body parts into my trunk
