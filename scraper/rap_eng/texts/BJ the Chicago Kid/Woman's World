[Chorus]
This is a woman’s world
This is a woman’s world
I know you heard that this is a man’s world
But this is a woman’s world

[Verse 1]
Money just don’t compare
Far more valuable than a house made of gold

[Pre-Chorus]
Rareness and a beauty just a few qualities
Stand on your own two feet always proud to be
Strength when I’m weak baby, truth is
God knew what he was doing

[Chorus]
This is a woman’s world
This is a woman’s world
I know you heard that this is a man’s world
But this is a woman’s world

[Verse 2]
Let’s talk about the power
The power of a woman
Tell me who can give life to a baby boy and turn him in to a man

[Pre-Chorus]
Rareness and a beauty just a few qualities
Stand on your own two feet always proud to be
Strength when I’m weak baby, truth is
God knew what he was doing

[Chorus]
This is a woman’s world
This is a woman’s world
I know you heard that this is a man’s world
But this is a woman’s world

[Bridge]
Show me a man
A powerful man
I will show you a strong woman behind him
Search far as you can and you’ll understand
That in the end this is a woman’s world
