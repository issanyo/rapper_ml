Ugh
(Laugh)
It's Money
Yeah
Chicago, Midwest
Let's get it
Aye This time we going in
Only thing stopping you from greatness is yourself
Stay focus on that paper, Let them hoes chase that bank roll (laugh)
This one going out to everybody who work hard everyday who got lavish dreams and addictions

Verse: 1
Use to be nothing but high end fashion
Now I'm into boutiques, match the polo with the 10 deep
With 95's that you ain't never seen
Feeling like a dream that we doing it
But I pray to god we don't ruin it
Still hustle in the streets
Trying to make a couple dollars off a P
Like em light skin with pretty feet
We trying to make it to that Dupont Registry
With them cars that a change a nigga life
And a crib that's better than a site of downtown at night
(Yeah that's what we want)
No hollywood niggas where we hang
Air bag we got the marijuana on the plane
Shit is crazy I should've had a baby
Young nigga but couldn't nobody come close trying to persuade me
Know exactly why my mind tripping
Cause these Lavish Dreams and Addictions got a nigga wishing/

Hook
Got me wishing that I had it all
But I know inside it all has a cause
So tell me are you willing to pay it
And the games are willing to play it
To keep it trill there's no rules at all
Just gotta be ready when the time calls
And player don't get caught sleeping
Cause I'm luxury dreaming

Verse 2:
They say my flow sound like a Phanton
Ready for take off iPod on the random
These hoes I love em but yet I can't stand em
Lets have a slumber party in my nigga mansion
I want that fifth ave Manhattan millionaire life
What a feeling at night (Gotta get it)
And I was born to dedicate
Count paper and switch states the shit great
I'm from the city that's surrounded by the Great Lakes
And when it's summer it's a new state
If you don't like it it's consider hate
You from the burubs then you probably fake (that's what they say)
But in this situation it ain't the case
You listen close you'll love what I say
Money old got it turning to grey
And I'm prepared for success I'm just waiting my day

Hook
Got me wishing that I had it all
But I know inside it all has a cause
So tell me are you willing to pay it
And the games are willing to play it
To keep it trill it's no rules at all
Just gotta be ready when the time calls
And playing don't get caught sleeping
Cause I'm luxury dreaming
