[Verse 1: Highlife]
I wake up wit a swisher
It's Highlife baby, you ain't got to say Mr
Low end pimpin, no blunt skimping
Don't try em, theres know chump in him
MOGs losing... I'm winnin
In the city of the hate where mogs comfortable wit grinning
Fucked up buildings, bike life children
The lose square mog even know how I'm feelin
We hate on the next mog we don't give no fawk
If I don't see Ish i don't give know cut
All in my ashtray is boss dawg ducks
I just had a long day I'm about to roll one up
Bout to take bike trip, Lake Shore nice trip
Nigga, JJ fish, mild sauce on my strips
The city of the gyro, Cold Hard is the west side hero
Hype Park wit Dwel, smoke on some deisel
Head to the wall spray my tag for the people
Hop in the whip wit Vic, he smokin papers
Ask that nigga for a mutherfuckin favor
To take me get 55th to grab some kicks
I get them shits early, I don't get taxed bitch
My city not the cleanest, famo part of my English

[Chorus: BJ The Chicago Kid]
Ain't no need to ask where I'm from (where I'm from, where I'm from)
Chicago is the city where I'm from (where I'm from, where I'm from)
And I'm so proud (Whooooooahoooooahooooo)
Chicago!

Now ain't no tellin what Highlife sellin
And BJ singing mean your lady gon be in
Going late night drinkin
Got me thinking bout the city that I be in
Place to smoke trees in
Cause there's no bitching, no snitichin, no treason
Ghetto on a fixed gear, exercise demons
Pedal to the medal, every single weekend
Sky line greet me, I can see the bitch Cheesin
All my niggas eatin, sushi European
Goin for the win with the 4th quarter D in
On low end, kickin it wit Spencer doe
If she ain't going then I switch her for a different hoe
Real mog principle, Go Ill typical
Boss hogg, boss dawg
Yeah
Smoke  clouds, cough fog
Till it blow over
Leave the Chevy nova for a range rover
It's a cold cold world but I say colder
And hit dem hoes wit the cold shoulder
Smoke a swissher when the flows over
But and till then you can hit me on the fixie til the wheel bends
Got me feelin like a mason when I'm buildin
Cause it's Brainiac, Savemoney, Treated all black like a dam Animaniac
Don't wonder where they made me at
Play it back

[Chorus: BJ The Chicago Kid]
