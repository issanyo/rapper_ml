[Bridge]

I need you
You're all i want
And i need you
I would've gave you everything
Everything
Anything
I would've gave you everything
Everything
Anything

[Chorus]

You think I'm falling
But I'm calling out
I want it now
So won't you give it to me
Everything
Anything
Everything
So won't you give it to me
Everything
Anything
Everything

[Verse 1:]

Here we go with this again
Instead of arguing
Can i get a kiss again
3 am, i send this text again
Bout how this shit is over
I need closure
And we just some distant friends
Pulling out this fight
I been tryna get this right
You been telling me you love me
But you love her
It ain't right
I been doing me
Outta sight
I been thinking bout it like frank
Cuz this shit ain't get no clearer
Since the fear of last night, UH
Thinking bout the old times with a main dame
Back when mentally we was on same page
Back when really, shit i would've gave everything
Everything but my name
Or the love of fame
Change was the only aim
Pain all we ever gave
Faith never came in hand
You ain't really give a damn
I just had ideas, Japan
We just lived a different life
We ain't really click though
I ain't really did more
You ain't really see me
I ain't make it easy
All this time you walked around acting like you need me
I couldn't give a fuck less knowing you ain't please me
Some things just take minute to adjust to
What dude

[Bridge]

And now its easy to see
You shouldve listened to me
Is what I'm hearing them say
I would've gave anything


[Bridge]

I need you
You're all i want
And i need you
I would've gave you everything
Everything
Anything
I would've gave you everything
Everything
Anything

[Chorus]

You think I'm falling
But I'm calling out
I want it now
So won't you give it to me
Everything
Anything
Everything
So won't you give it to me
Everything
Anything
Everything
