It really ain't no pressure, baby. I'll take you where there's good weather, baby. What you think about letting go, letting go? Girl, lose control. (x2)

[Verse 1: Freddie Gibbs]
Uh, tell me what you know about it
Fell asleep in the projects and woke up on an island
I'm ice cold where the gold pieces are the deposit
That baby face with a killer body, she bout it bout it
And if I play my cards right she might stay
I'm tryin to work on treatin you the right way
I hope you forgive me for all the bullshit cause ain't nobody else in the world I'd rather go through it with

I got plenty g's, Bentley keys, s'all you. Girl, let's stop the fighting. Pick a mall and we can ball through. (x2)

[Verse 2: Freddie Gibbs]
Uh, I just wanna make her feel good
She workin and wheelin, I'm twistin up the wood
Sleep at night and early mornin we gettin to it
Wake up somewhere we ain't never seen where the sea of blue is
Lately I've been thinkin bout, growin up cause I could lose her if I fuck around. I'm fuckin up, I go from state to state and town to town. But in the end I need a real one to hold me down
So hold me down

I got plenty G's, Bentley keys, all you. That don't mean a thing if I don't got you to come home to. (x2)

It really ain't no pressure, baby. I'll take you where there's good weather, baby. What you think about letting go, letting go? Girl, lose control. (x2)

I'm so happy that you're the only one. Could have been anywhere we end cause, row but you need me
