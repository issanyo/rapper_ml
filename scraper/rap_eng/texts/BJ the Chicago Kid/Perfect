[Intro/Outro]
That body perfect in my eyes
No matter what they say, everything looking just right
You get that blessing in disguise
Wouldn't known

[Verse 1]
She say her ass ain't big enough
She feel her breasts ain't big enough
She think her abs ain't flat enough
Now when you add it all up
I love it

[Hook: BJ The Chicago Kid & (Fabolous)]
That body perfect in my eyes
No matter what they say, everything looking just right
You get that blessing in disguise
Wouldn't known it, girl you got me
(Thim slick girls get me every time
Thim slick girls could get every dime)

[Verse 2]
(She like, hold up)
Let me pause for a minute
I know that this your jam
So sing this part for a nigga like
''Dida dida, dida dida dida, damn''
I bet seeing you get dressed in the morning baby baby
I swear it will make a nigga jump upon it
Cause your body, body, body, body perfect

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
(She like, hold up)
Hell yeah a nigga friendly
Uh, It's in my blood girl, it's in me
How do you want these [?]
Just to lead a itty bitty titty committee
All these girls yeah they need love
Real niggas need love too
And just because she thicker than you
Don't mean a nigga can't have fun with you too
Uh, oh Lawdy, got better head than she got body
She gave a nigga head, then a nigga can't tread
I been up her bed and gettin' coke in the lobby
Because that body
