And they asked why he named her Pineapple Now and Laters
This for color folk who sing the rainbow of Kool-Aid packages in the pantry
Who passed up the yellow Starburst cause they was nasty (Check this out)
This for my ladies with the Crunch Berry heels
And Frosted Flakes denim, You're Great!
I’m a witness to you killing them
This for every time you get that pack of raspberry Marlboro’s
Chi-town to the city of the Black Mamba, I know you feel me
For all them nights you felt like a Pina Colada Mistic with Sour Apple Charm
I know you listen to music, let’s go change how you hear it
After Pineapple Now and Laters your taste buds change
This Skullcandy, sweet somethings in your ear, straight raw that pure sugar cane
Sweet shock watermelon Sour Patch Kids on the brain
Brain starving for this album called Candy Rain
I hope you get a sweet tooth just off interludes
This the first time you got full off candy, instead of real food
This for all my Lemonheads don’t be fooled by junk food
Go ahead and show your affection for this perfection of confection
Feel no conviction for your confession, you love it
This history, so save your paper after you run route
Pineapple Now and Later
