[Verse 1]
Since I can’t cry I'mma let the song cry
'Cause it’s hard for me to sing when they come from my eyes
Since I can’t die I'mma lay my head down
And just wait for this dark night to fade into a sunrise
And this hand that I’m feeling is pulling me deep
So deep that I can’t breathe

[Hook]
'Cause I can’t erase all my mistakes
I’m just a man who falls on his face
Servants and kings have all felt this pain
By now I should be sick of falling on my face
Falling on my face
Falling on my face
Falling on my face

[Verse 2]
Feel like I can’t win so I'mma throw my hands up
'Cause every time I get close something mess up
Imagine being in hell looking up at heaven
And just saying if I can get there it will make it better
But this hand that I’m feeling is pulling me deep
So deep that I can’t breathe

[Hook]
'Cause I can’t erase all my mistakes
I’m just a man who falls on his face
Servants and kings have all felt this pain
By now I should be sick of falling on my face
Falling on my face
Falling on my face
Falling on my face

[Bridge]
No one to blame I’ll take the shame
Every stone that needs to be thrown throw my way
Sometimes the best lesson are learned when you know
And you find your way when there’s nowhere else to go
Now that I know

[Hook]
'Cause I can’t erase all my mistakes
I’m just a man who falls on his face
Servants and kings have all felt this pain
By now I should be sick of falling on my face
Falling on my face
Falling on my face
Falling on my face
