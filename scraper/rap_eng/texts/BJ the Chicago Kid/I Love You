I love all the girls
All the girls in the world
It’s so hard to choose
But, somehow
I chose you
I love you
(Yo Yo Yo)
So good, so good
Baby you know I love you baby
I love when you shine
(You crazy)
Cause complement me

[Verse 1: Problem]

Every line he designed on you
Like fly girls looking for watches
Chachi finna take his time on ya
Clear the schedule, make time for ya
Clockwork
Whisper something ratchet right before I make that box squirt
Maybe these ho’s feelings but yo heart, I will not hurt
Not on purpose anyway

You are, you are

My everything
And I love when you shine
Cuz you, complement my style
And I love you
