[Intro]
Way down
Way, way down
The deep secrets you keep that didn't weigh you down
Only now it was heavy on your soul

[Chorus]
Hiding in plain sight, in plain sight
Lord knows you're terrified
Oh, it's weighing down on your soul
It's weighing down on your soul

[Verse]
It's the way now
Just a long way down
The deep pain you feel when the truth comes out
Just like the wolf in the skies
Pulling it over your eyes

[Chorus]
Hiding in plain sight, in plain sight
Lord knows you're terrified
Oh, it's weighing down on your soul
It's weighing down on your soul
It's weighing down on your soul

[Bridge]
Way down, way down
Way down, way down

[Verse]
It's the way now
Just a long way down
The deep pain you feel when the truth comes out
Just like the wolf in the skies
Pulling it over your eyes

[Chorus]
Hiding in plain sight, in plain sight
Lord knows you're terrified
Oh, it's weighing down on your soul
It's weighing down on your soul
It's weighing down on your soul
