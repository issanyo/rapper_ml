[Verse 1: Goapele]
Since the day I saw you babe
Distractions on a daily basis
All that's running through my mind is your face
You know I don't trust easily
But this is all I'll ever need
Just turn the lock; you've always had the key

[Chorus: Goapele]
So won't you just stay a little longer?
Love a little stronger
Right here is where you belong with me
So won't you just stay a little longer?
Love a little stronger
Right here is where you belong with me

[Verse 2: BJ The Chicago Kid]
The world outside is a tempting place
It can't compare or can't replace
What we have is something so unique
And life will throw us crazy things
But my love stands, still it remains
If I lost it all youâ€™re all I need

[Chorus: Goapele]
So won't you just stay a little longer?
Love a little stronger
Right here is where you belong with me
So won't you just stay a little longer?
Love a little stronger
Right here is where you belong with me

[Refrain: BJ The Chicago Kid & Goapele]
Baby, I'm yours
You belong with me
Baby, I'm yours
Baby you're mine

[Verse 3: Goapele & (BJ The Chicago Kid) + both]
I've given you my everything
(Baby, you ain't seen the rest of me)
Only Heaven knows where this can go
(Baby, give it to me, don't stop)
And I don't want to rush a thing
And I ain't gonna run away
'Cause in this moment there is nowhere else I'd rather be

[Chorus: Goapele]
So won't you just stay a little longer?
Love a little stronger
Right here is where you belong with me
So won't you just stay a little longer?
Love a little stronger
Right here is where you belong with me
So won't you just stay a little longer?
Love a little stronger
Right here is where you belong with me
So won't you just stay a little longer?
Love a little stronger
Right here is where you belong with me

[Outro]
Said I'm gonna stay right here
With me, with me, with me, with me
You belong with me
With me
I get high sometimes
Know that you're all mine
No, no
