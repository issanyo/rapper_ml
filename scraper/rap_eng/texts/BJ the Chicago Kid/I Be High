Watch, watch

[Verse 1: Tiara Thomas]
I got a couple niggas that I oughta love
I got hoe friends, they got all the drugs
I'm in Saks Fifth, don't follow us
They like, "Bitch, you can't with the Margiellas"
I'm like, "Shit, bitch, you actin' like it's hard for us"
I know it's hard for ya, put a middle finger up when they start to judge
Move finger in the bum and shut up to fuck

[Chorus: BJ The Chicago Kid & Tiara Thomas]
Ooh, yeah
Pulled up in a Jeep 'cause I'm humble, you know me, yeah
Ol' boy said that you was a freak, come and show me, yeah
Oh now you love a nigga and I think I know why
But I don't give a fuck 'cause you know I be high
'Cause you know I be high
'Cause you know I be high
'Cause you know I be high
But I don't give a fuck 'cause you know I be

[Verse 2: BJ The Chicago Kid]
Backwoods and front two leaves
That's what I got when I roll up
If you fuck with me, then you stuck with me
In the cut with me and we fold up
You know I roll up the best
Shout out to my connect
Now you know I smoke one the best
You feel that shit in your chest
Inhale, nigga, exhale, nigga
Now baby, you claim you a freak
Whatever's on your mind, baby, it's fine
Matter fact, it's all on me
No hesitation when I'm faded, ooh

[Chorus: BJ The Chicago Kid & Tiara Thomas]
Ooh, yeah, yeah, yeah
Pulled up in a Jeep 'cause I'm humble, you know me, yeah
Ol' boy said that you was a freak, come and show me, yeah
Oh now you love a nigga and I think I know why
But I don't give a fuck 'cause you know I be high
'Cause you know I be high
'Cause you know I be high
'Cause you know I be high
But I don't give a fuck 'cause you know I be
