[Verse 1: Freddie Gibbs]
At night I can't sleep, I toss and turn
So I just twist up a sweet
Brain tissue stay gettin burned
As I cruise up 94, did a robbery night before
He thought I was there to purchase 10, but I robbed him for 90 more
Now I'm 100 solid, bout to set up shop in Wisconsin
Grabbed my phone and chirped my plug in Milwaukee, he just responded
Homie told me sex, money and drugs, they rule the earth
So get your own, you know them thangs good as gone when they touch the turf
Destined to pay for my dirt, the resist of temptation was hard
So be a thug from your birth til you face to face with your god
And when I'm faced with that moment, I check out chiefin on straight kill
Baptized in a lake of fire, so this how hell feel
And I ain't never snitched or took the stand, bitch I'm a gangsta

[Verse 2: Freddie Gibbs]
Made nigga, bitch Ima make it at all costs
Few of these niggas be testin me, but they resume all false
Heard his family wept, with my weaponery blew the wall off
Know some Belizian boys that'll bury you with your balls off
Castrated
Niggas in yo click cut yo throat just cuz you candy painted
Made a little change and they forgot that you barely made it
Fuck it, two tears in a bucket of crabs
I couldn't put food in my budget, I was bustin my ass
To make a choice to either eat or have money for gas
Enough to make you break morals for the love of this cash
The devil work and he stay immersed in my idle time
When there ain't shit twerkin, niggas get murked in this life of mine
And I took some hits on some niggas, never knew what they did
Never considered they momma, they family or they kid
Loaded up my sig, got a pint of gin and I took a swig
Bout to go knock his ass off the map cuz I'm on my dick

[Hook: Freddie Gibbs]
I'm a made nigga, bitch Ima make it at all costs
If you niggas seen what I saw, you'd roll with a sawed off
Heard he utter words of my murder, but it was all talk
The killers I know don't get caught, but I bet they all walk
I'm a made nigga, bitch Ima make it at all costs
If you niggas seen what I saw, you'd roll with a sawed off
Few of these niggas be testin me, but they resume all false
This thuggin gon' be the death of me, lord we all lost

[Outro: BJ The Chicago Kid]
Tell me what would you do if you were in my shoes?
Can you tell me?
What would you do if you were in my shoes?
Can you tell me?
Can you tell me what would you do?
What would you do if you were in my shoes?
Can you tell me?
Tell me what would you do if you were in my shoes?
