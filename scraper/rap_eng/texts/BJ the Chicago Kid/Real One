Hook:
She said she fucking with me on the lizzo
She’ll do whatever, long as nobody knizzo
I met her thru one of my brizzo’s
Fucking with a real one, with a real one
Fucking with a real one

Verse 1:
I’m the real one
Take you to home plate, I never had to steal one
Waiting at third base, no curving, like changeup
Past our bedtime, make that thang stay up
Take the makeup off, and let’s make up
Waiting on you and your man to break up
Keepin’ it A1, but the steaks up
Finna hit it in the morning when we wake up, fuck the day up. Uh
Girl pop that
Stop talking emotions, I ain’t about that
Your mind working hard, thinking maybe I’ll replace him
But I’m here for one thing, so embrace it
Drank should be the only thing you chasing
My name should be the only thing you saying
If you came to get deep, crawl back into that jeep
Cause fucking is the only way you staying

Verse 2:
Keep the lights on
Let me see what that mouth do
You said you're the best
Honestly, I don't doubt you
Don't know shit about you
Couldn't give less than a shit about you
But the way you’re licking your lips and shaking your hips
I don't see how I lived without you
So glad I found you. Girl, I’m bout to
Hit you in a style, I can doggy pound you
In the bedroom all over the house too
Over the bathtub, bent over the couch too
Keep this shit on the low low
He won't get mad if he don't know though
I was never concerned about the way you feel
You said you always loved it when I keep it real though, so...
