[Verse 1]
Twice I turned my back on you
I fell flat on my face but didn't move
So tell me where would I go
Tell me what led you on, I'd love to know

[Hook]
Was it the blue night gone fragile
Was it about the men?
In a wonder, steady-going under
Was it the light ways?
So frightening, was it a two wills?
One mirror holding us dearer now
Now, now, now
Now, now, now

[Verse 2]
I thought I heard an answer once
But your random way swept me along
Colossal signs so I got lost
With so many lovers singing songs

[Hook]
Was it the blue night gone fragile
Was it a bow of a man?
In a wonder, steady-going under
Was it the light ways?
So frightening, was it a two wills?
One mirror holding us dearer now
Now, now, now
Now, now, now

One mirror holding us dearer now
Now now now
Now now now
One mirror holding us dearer now
Now now now
Now now now
One mirror holding us dearer now
Now now now
Now now now
