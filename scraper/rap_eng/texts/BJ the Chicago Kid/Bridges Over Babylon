[Verse 1: Benny Cassette]
Women, women, women, will make you want it all
Money, money, money, will pay for your downfall
Lovers, lovers, lovers, they bring you close to God
The Devil aims to please, so have yourself a ball

[Pre-Chorus]
Hey, diamonds keep falling from the sky
Hey, the gold that dances in your eyes
Hey, the palaces that we brought to life
Crumbling underneath an all stars line

[Chorus]
Babylon, Babylon, Babylon
I'm trying to get back to Jerusalem
Babylon, Babylon, Babylon
I'm trying to get back to Jerusalem
Babylon, Babylon, Babylon
I'm trying to get back to Jerusalem

[Post-Hook] (x2)
Say my love, say my love
Say my love [?]

[Verse 2: BJ The Chicago Kid]
I'll never justify the evil in my eye
While I'm getting high off my ego's own supply
They got our souls for sale, in hell but they can't tell
Falling under the spell, of that your Jezabel

[Pre-Chorus] + [Chorus] + [Post-Chorus] (x3)
