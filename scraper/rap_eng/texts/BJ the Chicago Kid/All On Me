[Verse 1]
Got up with her around three
Said she just wanted to talk
But I know she had a drink or two or three
But then it went wrong
We've been friends for many years
Sometimes I was like a close brother
So I still can't believe in one night
Two friends become lovers

[Hook]
Now it's all on me
And it's all on you
Yeah it's all on the both of us girl
Now what we gon' do
Said it's all on me
And it's all on you
Said it's all on the both of us girl
Now what we gon' do?

[Verse 2]
Yeah we used to flirt here and there
Even though we both knew we had to stop
Before it got too out of hand
Even though I knew I could beat it up like a cop
And I heard when you drink
They say the truth comes out
Well I'll tell you what
After we done we'll see just how it all pan out

[Hook]
Now it's all on me
And it's all on you
Yeah it's all on the both of us girl
Now what we gon' do
Said it's all on me
And it's all on you
Said it's all on the both of us girl
Now what we gon' do?

[Verse 3]
I'm with it if you with it
You just can't tell nobody
That I touch your body
Don't let nobody around
They be mad as a motherfucker
Mad as a motherfucker
You're so bad
You're still bad as a motherfucker
Yah you're such a lady girl, but you're still my dog
I know you talk to niggas, never tripping when they call
Know I keep it cool like it ain't nothing at all girl
But remember that time you blew my mind next time that nigga call
Ooh I swear you fly girl
(?)
(?) roll your eyes girl
We could smoke a little tree
Ooh we gon' be in so much trouble baby
Fuck around and have a baby
Word up

[Bridge Out]
Ooh we gon' be in so much trouble baby
Fuck around and have a baby
You be badder than a motherfucker
Badder than a motherfucker
You're so bad
Yah you're just still badder than a motherfucker

[Sample: (?)]
Let me have a peek what's wrong with her
Yah she's quite ill
We're looking at a severe case of anemia
She needs rest
I'm not releasing her, not for at least another three weeks

Sit up for me, sit up for me
