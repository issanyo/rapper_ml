Girl I want you so
I can't lie, to get to you my line
It's kind of like the winter's cold
But with you in my life I'm stuck in July

[Bridge]
Even when we fuss and fight
I can't stay mad at you 'cause baby
We'll be back making love that night
Baby how we do what we do drive me crazy

[Hook]
So can we make love
Like we ain't mad at each other girl
Baby making love
Like you trying to take me from my girl
Don't you wanna make love
I be really trying to get over something
Let's make love
Girl tonight

[Verse]
And baby when you come through the door
You're gonna feel like your clothes were robbed by the floor babe
And baby when you get to the bed
There's gonna be a whole lot of crazy things going through your head
You're ready by now I'm sure
I can feel the moisture from your Juicy Couture baby
Now I'm ready too
Sometimes it don't matter what we do

[Bridge]
Even when we fuss and fight
I can't stay mad at you 'cause baby
We'll be back making love that night
Baby how we do what we do drive me crazy

[Hook]
So can we make love
Like we ain't mad at each other girl
Baby making love
Like you trying to take me from my girl
Don't you wanna make love
I be really trying to get over something
Let's make love
Girl tonight

I want you
Come a little closer
Tell me
You (?)
Oh we can finally get what we've been waiting on all day baby
Baby yeah
