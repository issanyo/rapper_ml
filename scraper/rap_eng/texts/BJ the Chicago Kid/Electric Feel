[Verse 1]
All along the western front
People line up to the sea
Cause she got the power in her pants
To shock you like you won't believe
Saw her in the Amazon
With the voltage running through her skin
Standing there with nothing on
She, she's gonna teach me how to swim

[Hook]
Oh oh girl
Shock me like an electric eel
Baby girl
Turn me on with your electric feel
I said oh girl
Shock me like an electric eel
Baby girl
Turn me on with your electric feel

[Verse 2]
All along the eastern shore
Put your circuits in the sea
Because this is what the world is for
Making electricity
Oh you can feel in your mind, yeah
Oh you can feel it all the time
Plug it in and change the world
Oh you're my electric girl

[Hook]
Oh girl
Shock me like an electric eel
Baby girl
Turn me on with your electric feel
I said oh girl
Shock me like an electric eel
Baby girl
Turn me on with your electric feel yah

[Outro]
Do what you feel now
Do what you feel now
Do what you feel now
Electric feel now
Yeah yeah yeah
Do what you feel now
Electric feel now
Do what you feel now
Electric feel now
Do what you feel now
Electric feel now
