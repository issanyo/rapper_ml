[Verse 1: BJ The Chicago Kid]
I'm mad as hell, don't know what to do
I'm tryna get through
I'ma turn around and get right back to you
Shit, what they gon' do?

[Pre-Chorus: BJ The Chicago Kid]
Feels like they're holding me as a prisoner
Only thing in my head, baby, is us laying together
Laying right here in my bed
Right here, baby, next to me
This can't be my destiny

[Chorus: BJ The Chicago Kid]
'Cause, baby, desperately
I need you next to me 'cause I can't stop
Thinkin' 'bout ya, thinkin' 'bout ya
Thinkin' 'bout ya, thinkin' 'bout ya
'Bout ya, 'bout ya
All night and I think I'll still be thinkin' 'bout ya

[Post-Chorus: BJ The Chicago Kid]
It got me thinkin' 'bout ya
([?] mind go wild)
Oh, thinkin' 'bout you
(I ain't judge you when I [?])
I can't stop, no
(I know that my life be kinda wild
That's why, that's why)

[Verse 2: BJ The Chicago Kid]
They know answers, but you keep me smiling
[?]
And, baby, just the thought of you keep me from wildin'
I don't know what to do

[Pre-Chorus: BJ The Chicago Kid]
Feels like they're holding me as a prisoner
Only thing in my head, baby, is us laying together
Laying right here in my bed
Right here, baby, next to me
This can't be my destiny

[Chorus: BJ The Chicago Kid]
'Cause, baby, desperately
I need you next to me 'cause I can't stop
Thinkin' 'bout ya, thinkin' 'bout ya
Thinkin' 'bout ya, thinkin' 'bout ya
'Bout ya, 'bout ya
All night and I think I'll still be thinkin' 'bout ya

[Post-Chorus: BJ The Chicago Kid]
It got me thinkin' 'bout ya
([?] mind go wild)
Oh, thinkin' 'bout you
(I ain't judge you when I [?])
I can't stop, no
(I know that my life be kinda wild
That's why, that's why)
Got me thinkin' 'bout you
