[Intro: Dame D.O.L.L.A.]
Haha, you feel me?
I'm just wonderin'

[Chorus: Dame D.O.L.L.A.]
Who gon' be there when I'm down?
Who gon' be there when I'm gone?
When it's bad, no one around
You gotta fix it on your own
You gotta fix it inside
You gotta fix it in your soul
You can't fix it on the 'gram
You gotta fix it in your home

[Hook: BJ The Chicago Kid]
Every night I pray
You separate the real from the fake
The same way You separate the night from the day (oh, oh)
Yeah, I be
But I pray You help me see

[Verse 1: Dame: D.O.L.L.A.]
I know that it's gon' come a day where it won't be as fun to play
Wonder if my starrin' is bright, will some people run away?
I think about it
Lose sleep about it
I hate to even speak about it
I'm weak without it
Will they love me when I'm slowin' down and missin' game winners?
No longer buyin' flights and all them free steak dinners
Wish me happy birthday if it's over 'cause I'm injured
Is the luxury the only thing I gave 'em to remember?
Seen that movie, clearly happen often
Things went left, e'rytime they lost it
Now I'm up to bat, pray I don't go Kenny Lofton
Who gon' love my kid when I'm layin' in a coffin?
A lotta things to juggle
Who up in my bubble?
Who will look you in the face lyin', say they love you
Surprise you with a stab in the back, face double
Support me like I supported them when they struggled

[Hook: BJ The Chicago Kid]
Every night I pray
You separate the real from the fake
The same way You separate the night from the day (oh, oh)
Yeah, I be
But I pray You help me see

[Chorus: Dame D.O.L.L.A.]
Who gon' be there when I'm down?
Who gon' be there when I'm gone?
When it's bad, no one around
You gotta fix it on your own
You gotta fix it inside
You gotta fix it in your soul
You can't fix it on the 'gram
You gotta fix it in your home

[Verse 2: Nick Grant]
Uh, royalty blooded, hustlin'
Like Warren Buffett trust us
I'm tryna stack it like I'm doublin' the chorus
They are just tryna ride the wave, um
Please don't get nauseous
You know we bearin' arms if you stick your fingers in porridge
Hope you suited for war 'cause they tie up mothers and daughters
This is reverse slavery, how I'm whippin' this foreign
I base things off your character, I put nothing before this
I hate when they get corporate
I'm late, no time for talkin'
This here never gets old
Like I'm watchin' re-runs of Martin
My life: murder and murder
Who freed the greedy accomplice?
These youngins die over tweets
That bird chick is a monster
You see who they put in office, but quiet the feds recordin', uh
Real ain't when you beefin' with yo' brothers, homicide
Beefin' with yo' brothers just to let these races slide
Real ain't when you hold the camera just to watch 'em die
Real people set the standard, yeah, it's time to rise, I'm alive
So much, I could do this here for free
Trust in God, but sometimes you gotta pray with a knee
In the mirror with a angry face like, "What it mean to me?"
Opportunity opens doors, but consistency is key
Yeah, dope, dope, dope, dope
Yeah, I'm in the trap, killer
Sellin' hope, sell some more, all that there is whack, killer
Tell me where were you when I was out here tryna get it
Love this game, but I hate it, the beautiful contradiction
Player, listen

[Chorus: Dame D.O.L.L.A.]
Who gon' be there when I'm down?
Who gon' be there when I'm gone?
When it's bad, no one around
You gotta fix it on your own
You gotta fix it inside
You gotta fix it in your soul
You can't fix it on the 'gram
You gotta fix it in your home

[Hook: BJ The Chicago Kid]
Every night I pray
You separate the real from the fake
The same way You separate the night from the day (oh, oh)
Yeah, I be
But I pray You help me see

[Outro: BJ The Chicago Kid]
Oh-oh-oh, oh
You say you gotta fix it
Yeah, you say you gotta fix it
Yeah, you say you gotta fix it
Yeah, you say you gotta fix it
Yeah, you â€“
