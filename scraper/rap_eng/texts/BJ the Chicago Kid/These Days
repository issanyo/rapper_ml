Bottles and a hundred hoes

Verse 1: (JBdaPilot)
I step in the club and I promise you notice
We taking shots for the fallen so bring some more bottles for all of my soldiers
Purple heart is for the activists, these days I'm living hazardous
Stashing burners in the couch, keeping money in the mattresses
I went to school for my bachelors, graduated to the models and actresses
I spend a rack to get that off the rack all this cash is for whoever catches it
Come make it pop for ya boy, baby you know I'm the man
I got a lot on my mind, like me you and all of your friends

Bridge:
These Days I'm on a roll, money never running out
Tell 'em bring 100 more, bottles with the sparkles now
I know it don't last forever, (I) wish I could slow it down
(Let's) live for the moment baby (all) this money on the ground

Hook - (BJ The Chicago  Kid)
I just got 100 ones tell 'em bring 100 mo'
These days in the club 100 bottles and 100 hoes
These days baby I can take you anywhere you wanna go
And I know it's coming quick but just look how fast the money go
These Days I'm everywhere the money goes
You know I'm everywhere the money goes
I just got 100 ones tell 'em bring 100 mo'
And I know it's coming quick but just look how fast the money go

Verse 2: (JBdaPilot)
I walk out the club bet she leaving you lonely
She want a boss and we ballin', (got it) I'm squaded  with all of the homies (got it)
They put in work on the  avenue, I'm down to roll with my savages
Y'all be flexing for the summer, we been stuntin' for a calendar
I ain't got too much in common with rappers I only do foreigners no challengers
I used to pray for the the rollie now I got the prezi these hoes in my cabinet
Come make it pop for ya boy, baby you know I'm the man
I got a lot on my mind, like how much I got in my hand

Bridge:
These days I'm on a ride, where you wanna go I'm down
I ain't really for the talking, unless you say the right amount
I'm feeling I'm way too faded, (But) let's  get another round
(And) you see me throwing this paper, (Why) they wanna hate on me now

Hook - (BJ The Chicago  Kid)
I just got 100 ones tell 'em bring 100 mo'
These days in the club 100 bottles and 100 hoes
These days baby I can take you anywhere you wanna go
And I know it's coming quick but just look how fast the money go
These Days I'm everywhere the money goes
You know I'm everywhere the money goes
I just got 100 ones tell 'em bring 100 mo'
And I know it's coming quick but just look how fast the money go
