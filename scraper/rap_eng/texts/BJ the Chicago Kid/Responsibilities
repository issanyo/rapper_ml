[Intro]
At least you still talk back oh God damn
I ain't mad, I'm crazy motherfucker

[Verse 1: Anderson .Paak]
Puffy said it's all about the Benjamins
I'm good at making money but I'm way better at spending it
The heartache is killing me, I drink enough to numb the feeling
You know I'm chasing pennies
Mama said I need to see the bigger vision
But I'm broke, mama, I can't pay attention
Hey I'm dippin' in my rent money
Like it ain't comin' at the top of the (?)
My gas tank, never wanted to fill it
The chrome wheels make the bitches go silly
I just park it where they can see me
I'm eatin' out every evenin'
Coppin' trees like it's Christmas season
I can spend it before I get it
If you blink you miss it and niggas talkin' about investin'
You can miss me with it
Invest in these Jordans, nigga

[Chorus: BJ The Chicago Kid]
Look at you with your fancy shoes
And your high priced clothes
Tell me what you know
But no money in your pocket
Don't you need to stop it
That hold you got on yourself, you gotta unlock it
But I get what you tellin' me yeah
Fuck my responsibilities

[Verse 2: Anderson .Paak]
I used to backpack back tracking train to train
Way back in the days, seek hoes in my younger grade
No direction no lane, blowin' stacks in the rain
God bless me I came out of it
Had a little seed and doubled up my salary
Responsibilities, I had to handle 'em
Took my ass out the club, put more time into what's valuable
And I still don't know shit bout a 401k
But if I get a little extra I put that money away
I ain't stressin' bout the future, take it day to day
It's a marathon baby I'm just learnin' the pace
The more money I make
The more money they take
The more talkin' you do
The less food on your plate
It's a marathon baby I'm just learnin' the pace
Take it day by day

[Chorus: BJ The Chicago Kid]
Look at you with your fancy shoes
And your high priced clothes
Tell me what you know
But no money in your pocket
Don't you need to stop it
That hold you got on yourself, you gotta unlock it
But I get what you tellin' me yeah
Fuck my responsibilities
