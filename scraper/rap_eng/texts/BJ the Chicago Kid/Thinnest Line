[Verse 1]
I put a lot of people before myself this year
Yea but fuck it I do it all the time
I swear I paid a lot of people’s bills off this year
Yea and I ended up late on mine
I spent more than $100,000 and don’t have nothing to show for it
I pray my stars get realigned
I hope I find the thinnest line between two wrongs and doin what’s right but ended up left behind
I bet not many know how that shit go
I got a problem with not holding shit over people’s heads
Yea I guess you can say that’s a state of mind
I bought my first condo and moved the whole squad in just because
If we alone together then we home together
But youd be surprised how much your learn about a person when you see them every day
I guess that’s just a blessing in disguise
It’s possible that even a blind man used to have open eyes
Huh well it’s just some shit you don’t see coming

[Saba]
I like to be as mellow as the sun is yellow (yeaa)
I like to be as cool as the breeze
But baby I don’t trust you

[Hook]
And I pray that my feet touch the ground
And I hope that all lost will be found
And I got faith that I won’t let you down
Just find the thinnest line between the thinnest line

[Verse 2]
Yea I said that it’s possible that even a blind man used to have open eyes
Man there’s some shit that you just down see coming like
Imagine having a son by someone you don’t know
By someone you don’t love but still got to care for HER
Money you sending every month it don’t mean that you there for him
Even the time you left, ain’t enough for to reassure him
It’s tough but it’s for the better, do I compromise my career
Cause no matter the situation things ain’t always gon be clear for her
I try to keep a balance, maintaining
Just nonexistent the pressure of being a father when they questioning your commitment
When deep down you know you doing better than a majority of these niggas
Who don’t got a head on their shoulders, dream, team and power and vision
Who don’t got a tour life, Deadlines and a bunch of business that keep me backed up as LA traffic
You know stuck in the middle trying to keep it together and doing what really matters
Cause I always found satisfaction out of trying to make everyone happy

[BJ the Chicago Kid]
Please protect me from my enemies
And those close to me, close to me
Cause those the ones that hurt you the most
Help me see what I don’t understand
And be a better man

[Hook]
And I pray that my feet touch the ground
And I hope that all lost will be found
And I got faith that I won’t let you down
Just find the thinnest line between the thinnest line
