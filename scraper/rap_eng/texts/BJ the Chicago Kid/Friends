[Intro: Freddie Gibbs]
Yeah, sup
Got a little sum'
One-hunnit withcha know what I mean?
Yeah

[Verse 1: Freddie Gibbs]
Sometimes I admit you get on my fucking nerves
Sometimes I be through with you, nigga to the curb
Prolly got drunk and started some shit you don't deserve
Took my frustrations out on you and put 'em into words
Yeah you know how niggas get, popping silly shit
Twelve grade, drinking that blue beast, we was getting bent
I look around and wonder where all my real niggas went
Victim of violence, moment of silence, let me reminisce
Damn, my cognac trickles to the pavement
It's fucked up his family making funeral arrangements
Told me when he die: "don't cry just have a celebration"
Drive his casket through the ghetto cause the streets raised him, paid him
Always making sure your niggas ain't...
Suckas disrespect us and it's nothing we gon' demonstrate
Sippin' Henny, tryna get the strength to step up in ya way
Father why you let these pussy niggas take my motherfucking friend?

[Hook: BJ The Chicago Kid]
Friends
Tell me how many of us have them?
Friends
Someone that's always riding till the end
No hating, or money, or bitches ever coming between us
I'm talking 'bout friends
Most of us don't really have them

[Verse 2: G-Wiz]
Come follow me down road stroll
Fifteen years old, all we wanted was triple-gold D's on the fleetwood
Floss skates be good
He killed the highs and lows, nigga done been through some cold shit
Like when the doors got kicked and my [?] got sick
I was there for ya homie
Brother from another, damn near my kin
Running 'em streets and licking shots off of the corners, they been
Living life like we was outlaws
Plus, we told them youngsters not to be like us
When they grown, now ya gone
I take a [?] and still pass your way
Outcha own, my own castaway
Familiar glimpse of the past when I see my brother through his lookout face
We tryna hold on to yesterday
When I say my prayer, man I pray
Lord forgive us for these D's
Have mercy, I done made thirty
And I'm still dirty, and I'm still working
AKA second in servant
Maintaining until they call for all the curtains on me and all my...
