[Verse 1]
Shit's so cold
I try to leave, it won't leave me lone
I keep having flashbacks of me hitting it hard from the back
Roll you 'round on your front
Girl I love just how it tastes
You gon' have my son
'Cause nights like this

[Pre-Chorus]
We be making love
For the nights we've missed
Crazy we started off of just one kiss
Now we both look like fiends
Girl look what we did, look at this shit

[Chorus]
We done turned around and made nothing into something babe
Look what we did baby
Imma sing it again
Done turned around and made nothing into something baby
Look what we did baby

[Verse 2]
Shit's so cold
The flames still be burning when we get old
Baby girl every time you touch me you
Touch my soul
You touch it on nights like this

[Pre-Chorus]
We be making love
For the nights we've missed
Crazy we started off of just one kiss
Now we both look like fiends
Girl look what we did, look at this shit

[Chorus]
We done turned around and made nothing into something babe
Look what we did baby
Imma sing it again
Done turned around and made nothing into something baby
Look what we did baby
