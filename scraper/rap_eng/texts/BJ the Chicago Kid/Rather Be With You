[Verse 1]
Bout to go again
Round the world again
Time to kiss you, I'm gonna miss you again
Never think nothing is more important than you to me
We both know
I love what I do
I know you love it too
You're my best friend
I do it all because of you
My everything turns to nothing
When you're not with me
And I

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't wanna be in the club all night thinking
Up arguing about how much money Puff making
Oh baby I swear that I'd rather be with you
Yes I do
If I woke up and I was Superman
And the whole world's fate was laying in my hands
Oh baby I swear that I still would rather be with you
Yes I do

[Chorus]
I'd rather be with you
Ooh I swear I would
I'd rather be with you
You know who this is
Yeah I'm talking to you

[Verse 2]
Its the simple things I miss
Like the way we kiss
After laughing 'bout Martin episodes we missed
And playing our favorite music all day long
Oh baby how you touch me
When you ask me how's my day
But baby it ain't the same
Cause we ain't face to face
Girl this love we got is so rare
I swear you're the truth
I'm telling you

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't wanna be in the club all night thinking
Up arguing about how much money Puff making
Oh baby I swear that I'd rather be with you
Yes I do
If I woke up and I was Superman
And the whole world's fate was laying in my hands
Oh baby I swear that I still would rather be with you
Yes I do

[Chorus x2]
I'd rather be with you
Ooh I swear I would
I'd rather be with you
You know who this is
Yeah I'm talking to you

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't wanna be in the club all night thinking
Up arguing about how much money Puff making
Oh baby I swear that I'd rather be with you
Yes I do
If I woke up and I was Superman
And the whole world's fate was laying in my hands
Oh baby I swear that I still would rather be with you
Yes I do

[Outro]
Baby, don't never, ever, ever think
Because I'm gone or I'm doing what I do
That it's never ever more important than you
I love you
