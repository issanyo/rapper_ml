[Verse 1: BJ The Chicago Kid]
Now and then I think of when we were together
Like how you said you felt so happy you could die
Told myself that you'd do right by me
But felt so lonely in your company
But that was love and it's an ache I still remember

You can get addicted to a certain kind of sadness
Like resignation to the end
Is always the end
So when we found that we could not make sense
Well you told me that we would still be friends
I'll admit that I was glad that it was over

[Chorus: Gotye & BJ The Chicago Kid]
But you didn't have to cut me off
Make out like it never happened
And that we were nothing
And I don't even need your love
But you treat me like a stranger
And that feels so rough
No you didn't have to stoop so low
Have your friends collect your records
And then change your number
I guess that I don't need that though
Now you're just somebody that I used to know
Now you're just somebody that I used to know
Now you're just somebody that I used to know

[Bridge: BJ The Chicago Kid]
Now she say she wants to love me
Now she don't she say she want's my homie
Now she fuck, she said she used to love me
Now she don't she say she want's my homie
Now she fuck

[Verse 2: Kimbra & BJ The Chicago Kid]
Now and then I think of all the times you screwed me over ( I admit it, I admit it )
But had me believing it was always something that I've done
But I don't wanna live that way
Reading into every word you say
You said that you could let it go
And I wouldn't catch you hung up on somebody that you used to know

[Chorus: Gotye]
But you didn't have to cut me off
Make out like it never happened
And that we were nothing
And I don't even need your love
But you treat me like a stranger
And that feels so rough
No you didn't have to stoop so low
Have your friends collect your records
And then change your number
I guess that I don't need that though
Now you're just somebody that I used to know
Now you're just somebody that I used to know
Now you're just somebody that I used to know
