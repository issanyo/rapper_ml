Oooh
Awww baby, baby, baby
I just got one question for you
How can you do the things you do babe
Knowing the things I know
You turn right around and keep giving me amazing love
Knowing that I keep doing you wrong
And writing love songs
But you keep doing everything
Everything that it took
To get me my baby
Baby, baby it gives me the chills
In my arms, in my spine, in my body
Communicating to you this way
Cause you keep loving me baby
Cause I'm just a man
Each and everyday
If you keep doing
The same old things it took to get me
To (?) the first day
Yeah baby
