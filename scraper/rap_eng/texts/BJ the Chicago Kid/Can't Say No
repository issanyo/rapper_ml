[Intro-Sample (?)]
She stopped believing in me
See I got dreams in me
I got dreams that's bigger than St. Louis
She don't touch me like you
She don't make me feel the way you do
I can't even talk to her
You're the only one
You're the onliest one I could talk to like this

[Verse 1: BJ The Chicago Kid]
Something told me not to go to the club that night
I know she would be there
Plus me and my girl just had a fight
Like any man in a fight with his girl
It leaves you open
So I was going hoping she would be there
(?) from lying might as well (?)
Soon as I seen her in that dress I knew just what I was gonna do
I'd love to tell you now where we were an hour later
But Imma tell you later

[Hook: BJ The Chicago Kid]
I just can't say no
Baby girl do all the things my girl don't do
I just can't say no
And there's too much history baby girl between me and you
Seem to always let go
Of the fact that I got a girl and she got a man baby
I just can't say no
We both know its wrong
But I just can't say no

[Verse 2: BJ The Chicago Kid]
Now I'm in the lobby of the hotel getting my key
On my way back to my car making sure no one sees me
I usually help her take it off but this time her legs were open
And we're trading emotions
I'm glad (?) and we having a good grown time
I know my girl think I'm out tripping, but I'm doing fine
To anybody that hears this song
This is our little secret, 'cause my girl hasn't peeped it
She'll go crazy

[Hook: BJ The Chicago Kid]
I just can't say no
But its crazy how she do all the things my girl don't do
I just can't say no
And there's too much history baby girl between me and you
Seem to always let go
Of the fact that I got a girl and she got a man baby
I just can't say no
No I just can't say it
No I can't say no
'Cause baby girl do all the things my girl won't do
I just can't say no
And there's too much history between me and you baby
Seem to always let go
Of the fact that I got a girl and you got a man
I just can't say no
Said you got a man
Said you got a man baby
I know one day we've got to stop
But I just can't say no tonight
