[Verse 1: Kehlani]
Best friends and lovers
Can't seem to draw the line between each other
What is defined means nothing to a brother
You just don't give a damn, that's why I think I love ya
It's not fair, how easy I melt when you play with my hair
I ain't going nowhere, it's not right
I can't sleep without you anymore at night time
Not in this lifetime

[Hook 1: Kehlani]
Love ain't never been so close, but so far away
Like your mind is telling you to just back off
And your heart says just stay
What's a love that doesn't keep you up all night and all day
If it's not too late, yeah you realise it one day
We can go to the movies boy, maybe we could hang out boy
Whatever you wanna do, cause I'm down for it
I'm down for you

[Verse 2: BJ the Chicago Kid]
One day we're lovers, next day we're friends
Don't know where it begins or it ends
But let me tell you one thing going through a nigga's head
Most nigga's just scared
It feels too good to be true
Every time I'm with you
I'm ignoring what I'm next to

[Hook 2: BJ the Chicago Kid]
Cause love ain't never been so close, but so far away
It's like my mind is telling me to just back off
And my heart says just stay
Tell me what's a love
That doesn't keep you up all night and all day
And if it's not too late, maybe I realize it one day
We can go to the movies girl, maybe we could hang out girl
Whatever you wanna do, cause I'm down for it
I'm down for you

[Break: Kehlani & (BJ the Chicago Kid)]
(I'm down for you baby)
Babe, I'm down for you
(Are you down for me?)
I'm down for you
I'm down for you

[Hook 1: Kehlani & BJ the Chicago Kid]
Love ain't never been so close, but so far away
Like your mind is telling you to just back off
And your heart says just stay
What's a love that doesn't keep you up all night and all day
If it's not too late, yeah you realise it one day
We can go to the movies boy, maybe we could hang out boy
Whatever you wanna do, cause I'm down for it
I'm down for you

[Outro: BJ the Chicago Kid]
And when I'm ready baby
Maybe it won't be too late
Maybe one day you find some guy
That won't treat you like I will
Better choose up, better hurry up
Time keeps ticking, but you're my lover
