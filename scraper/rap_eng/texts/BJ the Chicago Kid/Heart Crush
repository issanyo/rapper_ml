[Verse 1]
So sick of trying
So tired of lying
Past the point of dying
No compromising

[Bridge]
And that fire we had girl just couldn’t survive the rain
Heard the weather man telling us that it was gonna shower some pain

[Hook]
Sometimes we want to work so bad we stay too long
Then too long turns to too much
'Cause too much is how two hearts crush

[Post-Hook Bridge]
Sometimes it gets too much
A lot of everything but no love
Just too much
That’s how two hearts crush

[Verse 2]
Arguing about everything
And having sex just to make me happy
Our folks think we got everything
But they don’t know that we so unhappy
Every time I hear a love song on the radio
I think of what we used to have but ain’t got no more

[Bridge]
(Like that fire) The fire we had girl just couldn’t survive the rain
Heard the weather man telling us that it was gonna shower some pain

[Hook]
Sometimes we want to work so bad we stay too long
Then too long turns to too much
'Cause too much is how two hearts crush

[Post-Hook Bridge]
Sometimes it gets too much
A lot of everything but no love
Just too much
That’s how two hearts crush

[Outro]
I swear it feel like pain got a thing for me
It’s like love want me to be in pain and want me to leave
I swear it feel like pain got a thing for me
It’s like love want me to be in pain and want me to leave
I swear it feel like pain got a thing for me
It’s like love want me to be in pain and want me to leave
I swear it feel like pain got a thing for me
It’s like love want me to be in pain and want me to leave
