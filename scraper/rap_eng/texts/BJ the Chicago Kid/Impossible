[Chorus: Keyshia Cole & New Birth]
I've been waiting my life and I stayed on my grind
Now I made up my mind, it's been way too much time
That's why (It's just impossible)
It's impossible, and you know that

[Post-Chorus: Kanye West & New Birth]
I don't wanna hear that bullshit
I wanna hear that official shit
Kanye and that Twista shit
That's so impossible to get it (It's just impossible)
Get it, that's so impossible to get it
Get it, that's so impossible to get it (It's impossible)

[Verse 1: Twista & New Birth]
Ain't no way that you could pull up to the party
In a Bentley blowing B, gettin' club like this (Oh no)
Ain't no way that you could cook up in the studio
With Kanye and get it jukin' in the club like this
(Oh no, impossible) Ain't no way that you gon' win
Dust some haters off while I'm sippin' on my Henn
Holla at a chick while she sippin' on her gin
And I got the mobsters hollerin' at her friends
(It's impossible) For you to ever be the nicest
You won't get gangsta or get righteous
You ain't never stood on a tip like this
You ain't never stood for no shit like this
(It's just impossible) For you to get it if you don't wanna win
Get up off yo' ass and go for yours, I'm goin' for mine
Now you ain't from the ride what I'm in, know what I'm sayin'?

[Chorus: Keyshia Cole & New Birth]
I've been waiting my life and I stayed on my grind
Now I made up my mind, it's been way too much time
That's why (It's just impossible)
It's impossible, and you know that

[Post-Chorus: Kanye West & New Birth]
I don't wanna hear that bullshit
I wanna hear that official shit
Kanye and that Twista shit
That's so impossible to get it (It's just impossible)
Get it, that's so impossible to get it
Get it, that's so impossible to get it (It's impossible)

[Verse 2: Twista & New Birth]
It's impossible for you to ever get with me
Because of how I ride on the track
Got the bitch in the back of the Bentley [?]
Used to have the bitch in the back of the Cadillac
(It's just impossible) Niggas always hatin'
Even before I came out with [?]
You be sittin' back and be talkin' your shit
I can't help but I see you though, I don't get it
(It's impossible) Lil' mama, for you to fit all that ass in them jeans
Movin' kinda wilder, turnin' regular jeans into low riders
Tell me, can I be your man?
(It's just impossible) For you to ever deny that I'm about Chi-Town
Represent the city with the deal for twelve years
And sell a couple of mil' and still hold it down, that's impossible

[Chorus: Keyshia Cole & New Birth]
I've been waiting my life and I stayed on my grind
Now I made up my mind, it's been way too much time
That's why (It's just impossible)
It's impossible, and you know that

[Post-Chorus: Kanye West & New Birth]
I don't wanna hear that bullshit
I wanna hear that official shit
Kanye and that Twista shit
That's so impossible to get it (It's just impossible)
Get it, that's so impossible to get it
Get it, that's so impossible to get it (It's impossible)

[Verse 3: Kanye West & New Birth]
Get it, roll the weed up and lit it
Smoke a little but don't admit it
Do it like I did, too late, I did it (It's just impossible)
The controversy can't worse me, man
I'm eating but I'm still thirsty and
Thirsty, what is you sayin'?
I got a duel with a couple niggas, that's Thursday, man
Why the hell is I'm worryin'?
Hoppin' out the Benz with the perfect 10
"Man, your life must be perfect, man
Look at how they came up with the perfect plan"
(It's just impossible) It's impossible
Got strip clubs playin' gospitel, flow so sick in the hospital
You know I jammed out like 'Pac'll do
You know you throw your diamonds when I rock with you
Since Michael Jackson made "Rock With You"
I done did shit on Logical
Maybe 'cause we did the impossible
Baby, we done did the impossible

[Chorus: Keyshia Cole & New Birth]
I've been waiting my life and I stayed on my grind
Now I made up my mind, it's been way too much time
That's why (It's just impossible)
It's impossible, and you know that

[Post-Chorus: Kanye West & New Birth]
I don't wanna hear that bullshit
I wanna hear that official shit
Kanye and that Twista shit
That's so impossible to get it (It's just impossible)
Get it, that's so impossible to get it
Get it, that's so impossible to get it (It's impossible)
I don't wanna hear that bullshit
I wanna hear that official shit
Kanye and that Twista shit
That's so impossible to get it (It's just impossible)
Get it, that's so impossible to get it
Get it, that's so impossible to get it (It's impossible)

[Outro: New Birth]
It's impossible
It's just impossible
It's impossible
