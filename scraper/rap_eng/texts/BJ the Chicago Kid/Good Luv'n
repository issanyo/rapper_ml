[Verse 1]
Just her face'll make you wanna have a taste
Or just her smile'll drive you crazy for a while
Then I told her, "There's nothing wrong with me loving you
Baby, no no no, no no na na"
And giving yourself to me could never be wrong
If the love is true aw baby, aw

[Hook]
So let's do it in the morning
Sweet breeze in the summertime
Feelin' your sweet face
All laid up next to mine
Good lovin' in the midnight
Good sleep come mornin' light
Ain't worried 'bout nothin'
Just gettin' good, just gettin' good
Just gettin' good lovin'
(Everybody wanna feel that G-O-O-D-L-O-V-E)
Just gettin' good lovin'
(Everybody wanna be that G-O-O-D-L-O-V-E)
Just gettin' good lovin'
(yeah Everybody want that G-O-O-D-L-O-V-E)
Just gettin' good lovin'
(Everybody wanna feel that G-O-O-D-L-O-V-E)

[Verse 2]
Of course her waist line reminds me of this bass line
And if you went back in time she still would be fine
Even if this was 1959
Oh there's nothing wrong with me loving you, yeah
And giving yourself to me could never be wrong
If the love is true aw baby, aw

[Hook]

[Outro]
Everybody wanna feel that G-O-O-D-L-O-V-E
