Part 1: "Jeremiah"

[Verse 1]
The sun still shinin' bright
And the moon still glows at night, yea
But it don’t make me all right
To know another one’s holding you tight

[Chorus]
And it burns real deep (eeh)
Said it burns real deep
Jeremiah said it’s just like fire, yea
Said it burns real deep

[Verse 2]
The stars still shine at night
Reminds of the look in your beautiful eyes
Sometimes I stare up to the sky yea (yes I do)
Knowing somewhere you seeing the same sky
But you ain’t with me

[Chorus]
And it burns real deep (eeh)
Said it burns real deep
Jeremiah said it’s just like fire, yea
Said it burns real deep

[Musical Interlude]
Just in case you were wondering what Jeremiah I'm speaking of...not the singer, but, uh, the prophet from the Bible. Called to be a prophet at a young age, it caused fear in his heart to speak what the Lord gave him to say. But God told him, "you're not a boy, you're a prophet."...So pretty much fear not, know what I mean? So whatever he had to say for that day...the feeling that he had then, I have right now

[Chorus]
And it burns real deep (eeh)
Said it burns real deep
Jeremiah said it’s just like fire, yea
Said it burns real deep

[Bridge]
Girl I love you
Yes, I still love you
(Yes I do)
Always love you
(Always love you)
Forever love you
(Forever love you)
