[Verse 1: J. Cole]
Life make a nigga wanna yell out
Change for that fame, how some niggas turn sell out
Too old for my mama crib, I'm tryin to get the hell out
Stayin' out these cells but we working on that bailout
Help out, please. Sure is hard livin without cheese
Ain't shit in my pocket only these house keys
They pray for a nigga but yet they doubt me
That's why I'm out getting higher than balconies
But no I won't jump, being broke is childish and boy I'm grown up
My money runnin' late tho so boy I won't front
When my paper finally make you should know I'm gonna stunt
So, hard

[Pre-Hook: Kendrick Lamar]
My God, my life is such turmoil
Can't save me tonight cause times is hard now
I know you tell me don't let my guard down
I gotta get it my nigga

[Hook: BJ The Chicago Kid]
Never believe what they say
Man, I gotta get paid
Dawg it's so damn amazing
How I'mma shock the World
I'mma shock the World
Hell naw I ain't lying
Yea, I gotta get mine
Dawg itâ€™s about time
So I'mma shock the world
So I'mma shock the world

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
Stare inside of the soul of Kendrick
While I stare inside the solar, system hopin' I soak up
Enough game to play 3 systems with one controller and remain sane and remain unsober
Was closer to my dreams but reality actually told me hold up
No money in my jeans and my salary said you owe us
Can't pay them taxes, laid on that matress and feel colder than a polar bear
But this bear was in California
So I felt out a pocket and then a piece of lint fell out my pocket
A broke opportunist all in my optics
And you could see it even when I'm Sleep
My screw's loose, I hate when loose change fall in them seats
Because I need every dime like Magic Johnson
Or Hugh Hefner living in his prime
Prime example of youngin' on his grind
This the life of a Compton nigga
I know the vanities of the world like the promise niggas
That's why we crooked, in yo bushes where you find us nigga
You better scramble before you fold like an omelet nigga
This ain't insomnic nigga and that means I don't need Busters to front on me
A Bible in my pocket I'm walkin' like it's a gun on me
So when I catch a fade they know to put more than one on me
Fear no evil, I can still see Regals pullin' up
Niggas tuck like a baby in fetal, position
If you listen you can hear the city needs you
That's what my mind said
But my big head is tellin' me that I'm a black Beatle
Until my number is called and someone yell bingo
A shadow in the dark, park the coupe
Then recoup with the homeless in the park, Kendrick Lamar
