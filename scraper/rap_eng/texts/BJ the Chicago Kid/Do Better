[Hook: BJ the Chicago Kid]

Since we all understand this shit ain't never gon change
We all need to really try to make the best of it
I know its gon be things you can't change
But still you gotta make the best of it

[Verse 1: Onis]
Its no doubt im in better shape
Better form
Above the norm
Got a better taste like kettle corn
That bullshit im beyond that
Come journey with ya crony while I take a rewind back
Rewind that
Made some bad investments
Wasted time and finances
Not really a waste I learned a valued lesson
Couple foreclosures
Car repossession
Shit was hectic nigga had to pawn them vvs's
Under plenty pressure
But whats a young nigga to do when bills accrue thats far beyond his means
You see nobody never taught me how to handle cream
Helped some people I shouldn't have trying to keep it real
Hella spending sprees
Spacious loft above the Oprah store
I really lived it this is not a dream
All goody im woody
Back on my damn grind
Trying to inherit more carrots than keratin
Message in the bottle view the letter
Show effort nigga do better

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Onis]
Lesson 2
Came from the hands of a Betty Boop
Thought she was my boo
Drama queen amongst all things
But she was pretty in them Giddy boots
Quick to give a nigga the boot
Break up to make up
Sex added a boost
The love turned to lust
No more lovers deluxe
Black and Filipino
Thought I won boy I was yelling bingo
Plenty men know she love to mingle
Arguments in the coupe/that x-type
I guess the jag fit since im on to the next ride
I took that L like left eye
Can't lie that threw me for a loop like riding the redline
Had to regroup
Had to restrict circles
Rid myself of them Urkels
Now im riding solo blowing plenty green
All goody I'm woody
Back on my damn grind
Trying to inherit more carrots than keratin
Message in the bottle view the letter
Show effort nigga do better

[Hook]
