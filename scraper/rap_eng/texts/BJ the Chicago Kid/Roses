[Verse 1: BJ the Chicago Kid]
Knock knock here we go
She wanna play again
But a nigga ain't gonna go
She go from the safe house to the trap house
Then back to my front door
She on the same old shit
Wanna see a nigga fold
Now here we go again

[Bridge: BJ the Chicago Kid]
But I like it though
Every man love a good thing
Hard to let it go
Foget what they say
You know how the game go
And I ain't that nigga that's gonna be chasing, no
I know how the game go

[Hook: BJ the Chicago Kid]
Roses pretty red
She love to keep it going playing with my head
She know a nigga ain't got time for it
Roses pretty red
She love to keep it going playing with my head
But a nigga in love with it
Roses pretty red
She love to keep it going playing with my head
She know a nigga ain't got time for it
Roses pretty red
She love to keep it going playing with my head
But a nigga in love with it

[Verse 2: BJ the Chicago Kid]
She wanna go left I wanna go right
And I don't know
If she really down or just for the hype (real life)
And I be going through her pictures
Double tapping showing I like (showing I like)
What's the use of having venom baby if you never gonna bite
She never replied

[Bridge: BJ the Chicago Kid]
But I like it though
Every man love a good thing
Hard to let it go
Foget what they say
You know how the game go
And I ain't that nigga that's gonna be chasing, no
I know how the game go

[Hook: BJ the Chicago Kid]
Roses pretty red
She love to keep it going playing with my head
She know a nigga ain't got time for it
Roses pretty red
She love to keep it going playing with my head
But a nigga in love with it

[Verse 3: BJ the Chicago Kid]
But every time that she's gone
She's feeling some way all along
Its like when I call
She never call back
But she's at every one of my shows

[Hook: BJ the Chicago Kid]
Roses pretty red
She love to keep it going playing with my head
She know a nigga ain't got time for it
Roses pretty red
She love to keep it going playing with my head
But a nigga in love with it
Roses pretty red
She love to keep it going playing with my head
