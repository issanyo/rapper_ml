[Intro: BJ The Chicago Kid]
Too much love
Can’t keep it to myself
Baby girl, I think I need…

[Chorus: BJ The Chicago Kid]
I want you to feel the love I have inside me
Inside you tonight
I want you to feel the love I have inside me
Inside you tonight

[Pre-Chorus: BJ The Chicago Kid]
I want you to feel it
I want you to feel it, yeah

[Verse 1: BJ The Chicago Kid]
Lay it down, it’s time to pay up, yeah
I’m fresh up off the re-up, yeah
I know you're used to rain, but tonight you gonna pour, oh
They might hear you scream while I’m giving you more, more

[Pre-Chorus: BJ The Chicago Kid]
I want you to feel it
I want you to feel it, yeah

[Chorus: BJ The Chicago Kid]
I want you to feel the love I have inside me
Inside you tonight
I want you to feel the love I have inside me
Inside you tonight

[Verse 2: Isabella]
Viens ici, j'attends
Je veux sentir ton amour
Embrasse-moi
Arrête de parler
N'arrête pas
N'arrête pas

[Pre-Chorus: BJ The Chicago Kid]
I want you to feel it
I want you to feel it, yeah
I want you to feel it
I want you to feel it, yeah

[Chorus: BJ The Chicago Kid]
I want you to feel the love I have inside me
(Too much love, can’t keep it to myself)
(Baby girl, I think I need your help)
Inside you tonight
(Said, too much love, can’t keep to myself)
(Baby girl, I think I need your waist)
I want you to feel the love I have inside me
(Said, too much love, can’t keep to myself)
(Baby girl, I think I need your hips)
Inside you tonight
(Said, too much love, can’t keep to myself)
(And all night we gon' do it “to the beat, y'all”)
