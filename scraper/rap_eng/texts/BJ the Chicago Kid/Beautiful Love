[Verse 1: Jill Scott]
Fireflies are lighting up the night air
Our dance to a new a new moon's tune
The scent of your cologne, won't leave me alone
Eight phases to a lunar cycle
This is the time, this is the night to

[Chorus 1: Jill Scott]
Make beautiful love
Beautiful love, mmm
Couldn't be more perfect if we planned it
Hand in hand we walk, so romantic

[Verse 2: BJ The Chicago Kid]
Aw baby, there's no place I'd rather be
Than your chocolate-covered coated honey d
And baby, making love, just ain't making love to me, no

[Chorus 2: BJ The Chicago Kid]
Couldn't be more perfect if we planned it
Wouldn't change a thing, this is magic

[Chorus 3: Together Jill Scott and BJ The Chicago Kid]
Make beautiful love
(Make beautiful)  Beautiful love
Baby, I just love your beautiful...
Couldn't be more perfect if we planned it
Wouldn't change a thing, (this is magic)

[Bridge: Together]
Tonight I feel the glow
Two universes under one love, feels so spiritual
What you are to me is all time
Ooh, and we both know...

[Outro:  Together Jill Scott and BJ The Chicago Kid]
Couldn't be more perfect if we planned it (couldn't be)
Wouldn't change a thing, (this is magic)
(Magic)
Baby, I just love your beautiful....
Couldn't be more perfect if we planned it
Wouldn't change a thing, (this is magic)
Tonight I feel the glow
Make beautiful love
Feels so spiritual
Oh and we both know
(Couldn't be more perfect, perfect, perfect)
