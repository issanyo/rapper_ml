[Verse: BJ The Chigaco Kid]
I used to want a big wheel
I used to want the transformers
I used to want a basketball court
All Michael Jordan ?
New clothes, new shows

But baby, now I am a man, and all I want is you!

I used to want a brand new bike
So I could roll around my hood and ?light nomad ice
I used to want a jordan jammer
GI Joe, sake of genesis, Nintendo
And I know they couldn't handle, when I came to school
That first day with that fresh gold roach

[Hook: BJ The Chicago Kid]
But this year, girl, I want you (I want you)
There's nothin I won't you (I won't do, yeah)
But this year, girl, I want you (I want you. There's nothi..)
There's nothin I won't do (I won't do)

[Bridge: BJ The Chicago Kid]
Baby girl, all I want is you
Baby girl, all I want is you
(Yeah, it's christmas)
Baby girl, all I want is you
Baby girl, all I want is you
(All I)
Baby girl, all I want is you
Baby girl, all I want is you
(?)
Baby girl, all I want is you
Baby girl, all I want is you
Baby girl, all I want is you
Baby girl, all I want is you

[Verse: Jerreau of Fly Union]
Yeah, either your number changed or you ignoring me now
Probably changed my name but don't answer by now
You were so intimidated by my lifestyle that you tell it:
You can never see me settling down
Are you still down?
When I text you reply: "Who is this now?"
I laugh it off like I just - I didn't read that now
I be lyin if I say wasn't hurt right now
She still get to me, you suppress feelings, but they still exist
This is starting to remind me of our first kiss
Starting to look like some shit I won't forget
Damn, good/bad ain all that different
What you say don't add up, that's the difference
But let you tell it, it's just different
What you sayin, you know what I want
Girl, I used to come through - you should pull up
Girl, wassup!

[Hook: BJ The Chicago]
But this year, girl, I want you (I wan't do)
Theres nothin I won't do (I won't do, yeah)
This year, girl, I want you (There's nothin)
There's nothin I won't do (I won't do, yeah)

[Bridge/Outro: BJ The Chicago Kid]
Baby girl, all I want is you
Baby girl, all I want is you
(Yeah, it's christmas)
Baby girl, all I want is you
Baby girl, all I want is you
(All I..)
Baby girl, all I want is you
Baby girl, all I want is you
(?)
Baby girl, all I want is you
Baby girl, all I want is you
Baby girl, all I want is you
Baby girl, all I want is you
