"I've never really viewed myself as particularly talented. Where I excel is ridiculous, sickening work ethic, you know? While the other guy's sleepin', I'm workin'. While the other guy's eatin', I'm workin'. I have a great time with my life and I wanna share it."

Most people wake up if you ever turn the (lights on)
Cause it mess's up their dreams, they get mad like a (python)
Just like you, I'm tryna live my life (right)
And in the fight of life turn on the (lights)
And if you do that, then you'll be fine
Cause I remember dreaming, dreaming as a kid of me getting older
And exactly what I'mma do
I had to get ready cause I didn't know what time or place
To make my dreams come true

Then later onnnnnn...

I learned that you can't talk to losers bout winning
It ain't their language, they ain't never gonna get it
& Anything I can think of, I can make it come true
Just look @ me now I'm on DREAM II

My nigga Rico Love said turn the lights on
Cause you can see the truth a whole lot better with the lights on
Don't be afraid to turn the lights on
I've learned to dream with the lights on

"I want my life, I want my work, I want my family to mean something. If you are not making someone else's life better, then you're wasting your time."
"The first step before anyone else in the world believes it is you have to believe it. There's no reason to have a Plan B because it distracts from Plan A."

You just gotta find
Just let your ?
So I'll take it from here

And I've learned you can't tell everybody your plans
Cause sometime your dreams are bigger than them
You just gotta find your own place to grow
& just let your actions show them

So take it from me

I learned that you can't talk to losers bout winning
It ain't their language, they ain't never gonna get it
& Anything I can think of, I can make it come true
Just look @ me now I'm on DREAM II

My nigga Rico love say turn the light on
Cause you can see the truth a whole lot better with the lights on
Don't be afraid to turn the lights on
I've learned to dream with the lights on

"Greatness, is not this wonderful, esoteric, illusive, god-like feature that only the special among us will ever taste
You know? It's something that truly exists, in, all of us. It's very simple, this is what I believe, and, I'm willing to die for it. Period. It's that simple"
"I know who I am, I know what I believe, and that's all I need to know."
