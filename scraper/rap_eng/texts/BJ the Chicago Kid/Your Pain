[Intro: Davis Absolute]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah (x2)
(This is the way I feel)

[Verse 1: Davis Absolute]
Look
I don't know why You keep blessing what I'm doing
But the path is made clear, so I'm walking through the roads
My mind with spirit it's obvious that poverty's a truant
I'm inadequate can't fathom I can be of any use with
The sin that I carry the cost on that cross You give
Abba with a master plan so I head to the blue print
Find rest in strong arms, save me from the spell
Two feet in the sand and I can't carry myself
And still

[Hook: Kendrick Lamar and Davis Absolute] (x2)
I don't know why You keep blessing me
I don't know why You keep blessing me
I don't know why You keep blessing me
I don't know why You keep blessing me
I don't know why, I don't know why, I don't know why

[Verse 2: Davis Absolute]
Right now I know someone who's fighting for the next meal
While I got money in my pocket and a roof over my head
Extravagance brought into the plain view with the tragedies
Christian men and women goin' through the worst, imagine it
A better place is my God, ways for me to come home
Faith means walking in the unknown
Even though I am a young man I've got ambitious dreams with the means to support a family and get married to a beautiful queen
But Lord still

[Hook] (x2)

[Verse 3: Davis Absolute]
Even though rap don't put a dollar to a ring on her finger yet
I know reaching your soul is more significant
Not to place proud of the things of my life
Worry in the world won't place importance on the things that I write
You can discern that as pride
Belief, I'm always fighting it
What a strength to this puppet show abused by the violent
As I obey the Master the movements make music
I only pray that He can use it
And now I know why

[Hook 2: Kendrick Lamar and Davis Absolute] (x2)
Now I know why You keep blessing me
Now I know why You keep blessing me
Now I know why You keep blessing me
Now I know why You keep blessing me
Now I know why, now I know why, now I know why

[Bridge: Kendrick Lamar, BJ the Chicago Kid and Davis Absolute]
So I can bless you
So I can bless you
So I can bless you
So I can bless you, you, you
So I can bless

[Verse 4: BJ the Chicago Kid]
Lord help me
Cause I need You
I know this weed is burning
And I'm on drink number two
But it's all to soothe the pain from this
Cold, cold world
Sometimes I think You can help me
But this bus here is temporary
So I'm talking to You
This sick world will drive a sane man crazy
Birds dropping out the sky, daughters having their fathers' babies
And this the news I hear
When my god-kids, nieces, and nephews turn a year
I wonder, will it get better
A little cheddar, when it get better
But the rest of that cash
Make last year's Christmas gift you, my bad

[Hook 3: BJ the Chicago Kid] (x2)
But somehow You keep blessing me
But somehow You keep blessing me
But somehow You keep blessing me
But somehow You keep blessing me
But somehow, but somehow, but somehow

[Hook 4: Davis Absolute and BJ the Chicago Kid]
Now I know why You keep blessing me
Now I know why You keep blessing me
Now I know why You keep blessing me
Somehow, You keep blessing me
Now I know why You keep blessing me
Now I know why You keep blessing me
Now I know why You keep blessing me

[Verse 5: BJ the Chicago Kid and (Davis Absolute)]
If I just keep the faith (now I know why You keep blessing me)
I (keep blessing me) know You'll be right there (keep blessing me, keep blessing me)
Sometimes it may not seem that You are there (now I know why You keep blessing me, now I know why You keep blessing me)
But You're there
I feel You're there (now I know why You keep blessing me)
You're everywhere (now I know why You keep blessing me, now I know why You keep blessing me)
And I thank You for (so I can bless you, you, you)
Protecting me in these streets (so I can bless you, you, you)
From danger seen and unseen (so I can bless you, you, you)
I never know (so I can bless, so I can bless, so I can bless you)
What happened the night (so I can bless you, you, you, so I can bless you, you, you)
I wasn't there (I can bless, I can bless, I can bless you)
Something told me leave so I left (I can bless you)
(So I can bless you)
It was the next morning
Three got shot after the club (you, you, you)
All listening to that small voice (you, you, you)
Oh you saved my life (you, you, you)
(Oh I can bless, I can bless you)
