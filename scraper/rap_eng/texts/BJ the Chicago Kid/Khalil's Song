[Verse 1]
I’m back better than ever, surprise, surprise
They want me in a pine box but I’s alive
And I was told the streets might be my demise
Still I got faith in em, case [?]
From where I’m at to where I’m headed ain’t far of a jump
This how it look when you get to the roof out of your trunk
And now you open up that trunk and tuck up your roof
I’m walking proof the studies show ain’t always the truth
I stayed away from labels all tryna water me down
Stood on my own two and look what they offer me now
A seven digit nigga no longer talking in thous
My steps lead my niggas out, just follow me now
Look, I had a baby boy, that’s my pride and joy
And losing him would leave me empty, feelings null and void
I loved him before I saw him, that’s just raw and honest
Khalil’ll never want for nothing, that’s his daddy’s promise

[Hook]
The day comes when you got to make a stand
To turn from a boy to a man
The timing is never your plan
But it turns you from a boy to a man

[Verse 2]
I had a crazy ass pops and and angel for a mother
Real niggas trendy now, I been like this since I was a youngin
Pencils I was dubbing, ghetto fences I was jumping
Been a man since 17, you couldn’t tell a nigga nothing
I love that east side, that’s where the smokers reside
Church rang off the hook soon as I opened the trap
Dope money sidetracked, no time to focus on rap
Opportunities below but I don’t focus on that
To you opportunist niggas, don’t call me your homie
This shit for business, never pleasure, just pay what you owe me
I seen Scarface once, now I move like I’m Tony
With nothing given, nigga got this shit here on my lonely
See I got dollars to make, a nigga tryna be paid
Almost got locked before I balled, you know them Iverson ways
I’m way out of your range, probably never gon’ change
They say I got an old soul, I’m just acting my ways my nigga

[Hook]
The day comes when you got to make a stand
To turn from a boy to a man
The timing is never your plan
But it turns you from a boy to a man

[Verse 3]
I might just make a million off a mixtape
Then double park my whip in front your bitch place
Go and tell these broke niggas get they shit straight
And look me in my eyes, this that you can get chipped face
Hate is what you niggas wanted to see
Ain’t I everything you liquor niggas wanted to be
You think you balling, look here partner that’s nothing to me
I could teach a class on it, give a stunner degree
Since I was a juvenile, the block been 400 degrees
Iron on me loaded, give a bitch nigga a crease
And right now crooked hot, that’s just saying the least
Cook chickens like they battered down and cooked in the grease
Sheesh, I’m sick of telling y’all niggas
I’ll fuck around and put a shell in y’all niggas
Fruit basket, I might just knock the melon off niggas
Fuck a judge, I fuck around become a felon off niggas
Homies locked in them cages, can’t get em out of that box
Money on my nigga’s store door, connecting them dots
Good dick for them bitches, middle fingers for cops
Guns I’m toting live and loaded, ain’t no studio props
Granddaddy got a job that he done worked his whole life
Mama retired, still working, that’s that shit that ain’t right
I’m tryna make a way out, the hood held me back
And hood niggas never make it, you can’t tell me that
Cause I know better nigga, and this four on me’ll wet a nigga
My dogs killers, truth is I’m no better nigga
I used to have to ride on that Jerome Bettis nigga
Now it’s camera plates, tinted windows with that leather nigga
Do what I want and never what this world let a nigga
I come from nothing, what the fuck did y’all tell a nigga
Do what I want and never what this world let a nigga
I come from nothing

[Outro – DJ Drama]
Khalil for you, Skeme
Dedicated to generation now
Ingleworld 2, we’ve decided to take things to a greater height
This what y’all asked for

[Outro – BJ The Chicago Kid]
Boys to men
Boys to men
