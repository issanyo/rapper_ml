[Verse 1]
Yeah I smoke a little bit
Might drink a little Hennessy

[Pre-Hook]
But when it boils down to me
Doing my job I gotta do me
Yeah 365 7 days of the week
And I hang with the giants and we prey on the weak
Remember this is what you asked for now here come the beast
When you hear me kill every song just say "There go King Kong"

[Hook] (2x)
Yeah, yeah, yeah yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah yeah
King Kong

[Verse 2]
Sometimes I love to cruise around the city
Find some untempted pussy

[Pre-Hook]
