[Verse]
I love God
But I also love mob movies
I don't agree with everything I understand
But I understand it
The only things I'm afraid of
Is losing someone I love, God, and spiderwebs
I'm not afraid of failing
As a matter of fact I failed so many time
Before my first run around the bases
You wouldn't believe it
That's what taught me to respect the success
Trust what you know
Rock with your folks
But take no prisoners
