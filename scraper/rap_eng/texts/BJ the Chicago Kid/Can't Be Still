[Hook: Big KRIT & BJ The Chicago Kid]
Lord, Lord, Lord
I've been down for so long I can't be still
Calling out for your name, heaven it can't be here
Lord, Lord, Lord
I've been down for so long I can't be still
Calling out for your name, heaven it can't be here

[Verse 1: Big KRIT]
Mic check, one check, one two, anybody out there listenin'
To my pains and my disposition, I'm on that impossible mission
Tryna make somethin' out of nothin'
Before the government come and crush it
Ain't enough weed and Codeine you can pour me
To keep me buzzin'
Shawty burnin' palo santo to clear the air
Lay some Krizzle out even if my energy ain't really there
I'm thankful that you shared
I'm more concerned with a big house and a nice car
But she don't care
But I'm an alpha male so I grind
The 40 acres and mule, I want mine
Ain't nothin' free in life they woulda told me
As a new born I could barely walk
Tryna chase a dollar on Easter Sunday
Then they popped my collar like be a player
Don't fall victim to bein' broke
Them white folk want you down and poor
So get money, that's all I know

[Hook: Big KRIT & BJ The Chicago Kid]
Lord, Lord, Lord
I've been down for so long I can't be still
Calling out for your name, heaven it can't be here
Lord, Lord, Lord
I've been down for so long I can't be still
Calling out for your name, heaven it can't be here

[Verse 2: Big KRIT]
Nowadays bottles get popped
Ain't been to the doctor for a physical in a minute
I'm sure my liver probably shot
Ain't no sleepin' if you on
Tryna keep up with the Joneses
Yeah, it's lonely at the top but the view is beautiful
In the morning to tell the truth I miss my family
Ain't spoke to my mom in weeks
I promised her I buy her a new house
The next time that we speak
So I'ma hit the road like a flat tire
Run these brakes 'till they squeak
And I'ma pimp what I can from Def Jam
Cause I know my worth ain't cheap
Ya'll can't sell me no dream
I done been down and out, growing
If happiness is the tour bus that's a far aways from homeless
That's a far away from where they want me
Shuckin', jivin', for a piece of change
These niggas do whatever for the shine
But I can't be the same

[Hook: Big KRIT & BJ The Chicago Kid]
Lord, Lord, Lord
I've been down for so long I can't be still
Calling out for your name, heaven it can't be here
Lord, Lord, Lord
I've been down for so long I can't be still
Calling out for your name, heaven it can't be here
