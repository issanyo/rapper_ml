The taste of your lips
It makes me want you more
You're my little taste of heaven
All i'm living for
Babe when we are one
It takes me on a ride
Girl i grab your waist for ?
Because we 'bout to touch the sky

Some days we lived of a baby
Young seeing stars (stars)
Stinging the way passed and get further to mars (mars)
There's something about this place i just can't wait
Once you get here i know you don't wanna stay
I'm gonna planet love (planet love)
Oh planet love
Oh welcome to planet love, girl

Planet love (planet love)
Oh, planet love
Welcome to the planet love girl

Cloud ? got nothing on this place that we found
Show you what you worth every round
And baby girl if we want we can come back everyday
Just for you to tell me

Some days we lived of a baby
Young seeing stars (stars)
Stinging the way passed and get further to mars (mars)
There's something about this place i just can't wait
Once you get here i know you don't wanna stay
I'm gonna planet love (planet love)
Oh planet love
Oh welcome to planet love, girl

Planet love (planet love)
Oh, planet love
Welcome to the planet love girl

Planet love (planet love)
Oh, planet love
Welcome to the planet love girl
