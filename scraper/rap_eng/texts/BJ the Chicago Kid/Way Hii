[Bridge: A$AP Rocky]
Said she in love with cocaina, love to sniff it, my nig
Gave her drops of LSD, and  now she trippy, my nig
Told her if she get with me, I'll live life different, my nig
I'm official, ya dig? Come get with me, lil bitch

[Chorus: Buddy]
Way high, way high, way high
Way high, way high
Everyday we stay high, stay high, stay high
Stay high, stay high, stay high
Way high, way high, way high
Way high, way high
Everyday we stay high, stay high, stay high
Stay high, stay high, stay high

[Post-Chorus: BJ The Chicago Kid]
It ain't hard to tell what the fuck I'm on
Every verse I have, every hook is on
Plenty women 'round me with nothing on
Bad bitches only thing into my arms

[Verse 1: Buddy]
Floating as you rolling, smoking on this potent
Baby say she want a line, I gave her purple potion
Now I'm 'bout to go in, got her body soaking
Stroke it 'til the morning, well, I can't forget the Trojan

[Chorus: Buddy]
Way high, way high, way high
Way high, way high
Everyday we stay high, stay high, stay high
Stay high, stay high, stay high
Way high, way high, way high
Way high, way high
Everyday we stay high, stay high, stay high
Stay high, stay high, stay high

[Bridge: A$AP Rocky]
Said she in love with cocaina, love to sniff it, my nig
Gave her drops of LSD, now she trippy, my nig
Told if she get with me, I'll live life different, my nig
I'm official, ya dig? Come get with me, lil bitch

[Verse 2: A$AP Rocky & Wiz Khalifa]
This is how it goes
Niggas sleepy high, wake up stoned
Clique up with my bros
Nigga, hit my line with my phone
Hop in the whip and I roll
Getting these women, just giving them dick, that's for sho
Niggas is talking, we living it though
Finna' pull up in this bitch in my robe
Cozy Boyz sprinter on tour, fill it with hoes
They don't want drama, they gon' get exposed
My new bitch don't model, we drink out the bottle
Be so high, you probably think our eyes closed
Yo Wiz, man this shit finna' go
She in love with the coke and I'm sipping the fo'
Sniffing lines off my dick, puttin the tip of my dick in her nose, oh
Whoa, where did we go?
Got my own papers, I don't got to send you to the store
Got a bitch who stash my weed and got another one to roll
Got a bitch from Instagram who want to fuck me on the low
First I slide up in them DMs then I slip into her throat
We stick to the code

[Chorus: Buddy]
Way high, way high, way high
Way high, way high
Everyday we stay high, stay high, stay high
Stay high, stay high, stay high
Way high, way high, way high
Way high, way high
Everyday we stay high, stay high, stay high
Stay high, stay high, stay high

[Post-Chorus: BJ The Chicago Kid]
It ain't hard to tell what the fuck I'm on
Every verse a half, every hook is on
Plenty women 'round me with nothing on
Bad bitches only thing into my arms
