[Verse 1: Gary Soulz]
A fella just got fired how he gonna pay the rent now
He just rear-ended a whip how he gonna fix that dent now
Mind you his name is not on no policy
Pops said no because his pockets weak
And add the fact that He's an expert at bars
But not for a law degree uhh
Mother can't afford her debt had to file for bankruptcy
College got his sister owing thousands
Even though she got that grant money
He had to get some homies out jail n shit
Their folks wouldn't pay their bail n shit
And his home girls out angry fighting at court
Cuz she ain't get child support damn
Just keep your head up
There is no going forward when you're looking down
So never give up
The door is there you just gotta look around
We all going through it whether you broke or rich
Insecurities on the low
Even with the dopest chick
Realities of Mom's at Home pops is Gone
Cuz he was out too busy turning into crack fiend
Or Mom's at home pops is gone
Cuz bills got him hurts so he's workin Overnight to stack cream even the old white man stressin
Believe he has it all yet has his dome against a smith n Wesson  You'll always see me walkin with a smile
But bet there's shit pulling me down
Ya homie got issues

[Bridge 1: BJ The Chicago Kid]
It ain't just you my nigga we all got issues
Sometimes it makes you want to cry
Sometimes it makes you want to lay down and die
We all got issues
Got issues, got issues
We all got issues
Got issues, got issues 2x

[Verse 2: Gary Soulz]

Got a lot of issues on my plate but ima eat em up nigga
Nearing the climax ready to bust nigga
That HOV lane like what up jigga
5 zeros is settling below a Millie ain't enough nigga
Land of the free or the land of the beast
They hands up yet getting blammed with the piece
Can't even call the police
Without busting off shells from the chrome
Nowadays they throw you in jail or you're blown
Killing at an all time high
Uncle Sam question for you is you on our side
They're aiming & firing like we got 9 lives
Why you shooting He's innocent He ain't done no crime
It's about that time for the fella to get it
My homies I'm next on the road to the riches
You throwing shots think you fucking with me
I guess you don't know how shits going to be
Just got yourself issues

Bridge 2: Gary Soulz & BJ The Chicago Kid]
We all got our issues
Before you give up look around you my homie
We struggling with you
I know that you're losing your patience
But there's hope put down that pistol
This for me people out fighting their pains
Thinking bout what they gotta do to make a change
