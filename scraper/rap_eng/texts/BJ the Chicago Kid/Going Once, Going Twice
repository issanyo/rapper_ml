[Verse 1]
She can be whatever you want her to be
I'm saying lord knows
She done showed your boy a whole lot things I done never seen
Sex, drugs, and rock 'n roll you know she can't turn it down
So to any man that wants you
He can have you now

[Chorus 1]
She like to party, have a good time, ain't nothing wrong
She control the vie, play all her favorite songs
But when she roll up, put something in her cup
Don't you be scared 'cause she don't give a fuck
'Cause her hair's hanging down
'Cause she know her body right
Plus what she's on
She could go all night
She's really what you want
Dog she's just your type
I'm just trying to change my life
Going once and going twice

[Verse 2]
I know you've seen a lot of girls but she's the one you want
She can sex you up, cook a meal, and pay the bills
All while she's on the phone
She may talk a lot of shit
But on the inside she really ain't tough, no
I can help her pack her stuff
Hell I'll even rent the truck

[Chorus 1]
She like to party, have a good time, ain't nothing wrong
She control the vie, play all her favorite songs
But when she roll up, put something in her cup
Don't you be scared 'cause she don't give a fuck
'Cause her hair's hanging down
'Cause she know her body right
Plus what she's on
She could go all night
She's really what you want
Dog she's just your type
I'm just trying to change my life
Going once and going twice

[Bridge 1]
Oh, I found me a new one
And she bad, so bad
She bad, so bad
Treats me better
So much better
Treats me better
So much better than you

[Bridge 2]
Oh, I found me a good one
And she bad, so bad
She bad, so bad
Treats me better
So much better
Treats me better than you

[Chorus 2]
She like to party, have a good time, ain't nothing wrong
She control the vie, play all her favorite songs
But when she roll up, put something in her cup
Don't you be scared cause she don't give a fuck
'Cause her hair's hanging down
'Cause she know her body right
Plus what she's on
She could go all night
She's really what you want
Dog she's just your type
Don't you be scared 'cause she don't give a fuck
She like to party, have a good time, ain't nothing wrong
She control the vie, playing all her favorite songs
But when she roll up, put something in her cup
Don't you be scared 'cause she don't give a fuck
Cause her hair's hanging down
Cause she know her body right
Plus what she's on
She could go all night
She's really what you want
Dog she's just your type
I'm just trying to change my life
Going once and going twice
