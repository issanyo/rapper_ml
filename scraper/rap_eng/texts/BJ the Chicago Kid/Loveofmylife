[Verse 1]
It's really over now, she ain't comin' back
I really don't know how, things ever got this bad cause I
I said sorry way too much, this time sorry ain't enough
And now she's gone and it's only now that I realize
How much she means to be without

[Chorus]
I could lose a car, even body parts
Still I'll live but, still can't live without the love of my life
And everybody knows money comes and goes
There's never enough but it still ain't much
Without the love of my life

[Verse 2]
I thought that I was right for trying to be the man
I was hustling to provide but I guess I didn't understand that
The part that I was making the living for
All the while, I was just killing us
That's why she's gone cause she's tired of fighting
And I'm tryna' find what I should do to get her back
Cause I

[Chorus]
I could lose a car, even body parts
Still I'll live but, still can't live without the love of my life
And everybody knows money comes and goes
There's never enough but it still ain't much
Without the love of my life

[Bridge]
Cause right now, uh, (there ain't nothing in this world)
That matters (matters more than my girl)
So no matter what I (I gotta make it right)
Cause she's been (she's been there for so long)
I hate my self no (I hate, me when I'm all alone)
I don't know if there's anything I can do
But I gotta find my way back to her heart
(Back to her heart and then do my part)
My part (back to her heart, back to her heart)
So sorry for everything I ever did
If you leave me now, I don't think that I could handle it
I don't deserve another chance
But if you just give me one more
I'll give you a better man

[Chorus]
I could lose a car, even body parts
Still I'll live but, still can't live without the love of my life
And everybody knows money comes and goes
There's never enough but it still ain't much
Without the love of my life
