[Verse 1:]
Sitting on the front porch thinking about what happened
And how it all went down that shit was crazy
But you know I can’t afford to lose my lady
But you know lately we been going crazy
But you know we’re bigger than any of this
And you know that we ain’t ready to split
Am I wrong for thinking it’ll all go away or you could just carry on like you didn’t see my face

[Pre Hook:]
I’m tryna fix it all
You tryna tell it all
Could we just hold this off and wait till the morning
I know I did her wrong
But you tryna cut us off
Can we just hold this off
And wait till the morning

[Hook:]
Wait till the morning
(I know you gone tell her)
Wait till the morning
(I know you gone tell her)
Wait till the morning
(I know you gone tell her)
Wait till the morning

[Verse 2:]
I gotta tell her though I’m not bold enough
Even though I know I’m old enough
Loving her like I did before just ain’t enough
Only a fool would do the same thing
So I’m gonna call that place that I know she like
Tell em to hook it up hop in my truck every red light’s a green light
Then I pull up run up to the door had to be about midnight
And I knew what it was when that phone rang

[Pre Hook:]
I’m tryna fix it all
You tryna tell it all
Could we just hold this off and wait till the morning
I know I did her wrong
But you tryna cut us off
Can we just hold this off
And wait till the morning

[Hook:]
Wait till the morning
(I know you gone tell her)
Wait till the morning
(I know you gone tell her)
Wait till the morning
(I know you gone tell her)
Wait till the morning

I just need another night to make love to her like my wife

[Bridge:]
I know you loyal
To your girl though
But I love her
No more undercover
She my baby
And you her best friend
I know my name ain’t worth more than dirt right now but please listen

Please don’t tell her tonight
Please don’t tell her tonight
(wait till the morning)
Please don’t tell her tonight
Please don’t tell her tonight
(wait till the morning)

Please don’t tell her

I know you can’t
(wait till the morning)

Ring, ring, ring, ring
Ring, ring, ring, ring
Right  now you not answering your phone
And I got to talk to you

All I ask of you
Is just don’t lie to me
Just don’t lie to me
All I ask of you
Is just don’t lie to me
Just don’t lie to me
I’ve given you my heart
I’ve given my soul
So just don’t lie
I’ve given you every part of me
So just don’t lie to me
