Yeah, you know the name, Top Dawg bitch
No cat in this, I volunteered for these Hunger Games (Soul!)
I'm the one to blame for fucking up the frame of mind
Of many minds but might I mind you these are minor things
My aim is to ill instill in the powers that be, the power in me
To move matter with my brain, powder ain't my name
Money, power and respect, powder in my

And I hop out looking fresh as Zanerobe leather sweats
Fucking bitches in the PH, not the PJ's (Saudi)
Blow a hundred thousand dollar check, got them goons on deck
Be quiet, real killers move in silence (they do!)
