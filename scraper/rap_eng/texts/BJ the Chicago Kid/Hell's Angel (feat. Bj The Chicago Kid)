Summer breeze in the Keys

Off the coast of Belize

Is where I'd rather be

Then walkin' in the rain, two left feet

Tryin' catch the beat

Tryin' to dance with the stars, in the presidential suite

Sideline judges want me impeached

Like the world against me, I wanna drive right like I'm born a lefty

The score in the war, rise and uproar

Place like hell, but blessed with?

Man, I need my amore

With a taste I never had before

To sooth my desires she soars

With the wings, removes the halo

We both hate the devil, but she's hell's angel

They say you gotta go through hell just to get to heaven

Well, I've been goin' through hell since before eleven

Baby girl, you were meant for me and I was meant for you

But we'll see, just don't let me down (down, down)

Tan brown skin, nigga gotta cash in

Condone that good sin

Hair curly like Sue

Natural hair-do and I'm lovin' the view

From the side, from the front, or the back

God was smilin' when he made that

Burnt his hand when he made that

Precision intact

Attitude ready for combat

Lumbar pad, as she grazed my back

When a nigga was backsliding off the track

Throughout the thespian, I was through with the acts

And the games, Sun break clouds when I speak her name

Comes down with her wings, no halo

Both hate the devil, but she's hell's angel

Yeah, I'm flawed and imperfect

But my soul can never be purchased

Conditioned to worldly ways

Material slave with wrongful praise

Taught to live like every day's my birthday

Eye for an eye,? four-ways

Her actions slap me out that phase

The way she gives so selfish, kind of high

Unconditional love like a?

Warms like my heart like cold it get thawed

Not many folks makin'?

As a person she take hold and I let her

God puts folks in your life for a reason

Some for a day and some for a season

Comes down with her wings, no halo

We both hate the devil, but she's hell's angel
