[Pre-Hook: OG Maco]
In the evils among
At night, in the calm of the storm
It made you one
I feel alive

[Hook: OG Maco & BJ the Chicago Kid]
I feel alive, I feel alive
I feel alive, I feel alive
I feel so alive, I'm feelin' alive
I feel so alive, I'm feelin' alive
I feel so alive, I'm feelin' alive
I feel so alive, I'm feelin' alive

[Verse 1: OG Maco]
So alive you need to wrench from me
Take a bullet to the face or something
We the type to act a fool in public
Still shopping, eat the food of puppets
Who got drugs in this bitch?
What you smokin' lil nigga?
Few of us'll bring in M's
We the chosen lil nigga
Time is now to start a revolution
Fuck 12, fuck the institutions
Goddamn

[Pre-Hook: OG Maco]
In the evils among
At night, in the calm of the storm
It made you one
I feel alive

[Hook: OG Maco & BJ the Chicago Kid]
I feel alive, I feel alive
I feel alive, I feel alive
I feel so alive, I'm feelin' alive
I feel so alive, I'm feelin' alive
I feel so alive, I'm feelin' alive
I feel so alive, I'm feelin' alive

[Verse 2: OG Maco]
We put the trap in a dead end
Taking lives for these dead men
Take my advice and defeat your vices
Winter nights won't be the nicest
Take your pride and then sacrifice it
Know your rights and then exercise 'em
Dream big and don't undersize 'em
Yeah yeah
Who know but you the shit that's come easy
Niggas want beef, the game will get greasy
Not 'fraid of fame, I hardly get queasy
Media greedy, want the fettuccine
Genie, Houdini, making magic happen
Unleash the Kraken, plottin' war like Patton
Life is my visions, haters hate, I happen
Rage in my instance, hope you keep me balanced
Ay man

[Pre-Hook: OG Maco]
In the evils among
At night, in the calm of the storm
It made you one
I feel alive

[Hook: OG Maco & BJ the Chicago Kid]
I feel alive, I feel alive
I feel alive, I feel alive
I feel so alive, I'm feelin' alive
I feel so alive, I'm feelin' alive
I feel so alive, I'm feelin' alive
I feel so alive, I'm feelin' alive
