[Chorus:]
Either way it goes this shit’s all pimpin
For money an hoes, an even the cars an clothes you buy an even the weed you smoke
You better know-wo
Either way it goes this shit’s all pimpin
Cause if you ain’t buying better be sellin some’n
Cause ma niggas ain’t playin all about supreme clientele [x2]

[Verse 1:]
High life bitch, where d ladies at
I got all ma treated crown but I’m still a brainiac
Ease up mothafucka, get your cheese up
My fuckin blunt’s d size of a mothafuckin cheese puff
I puff, she scales, now she wanna jay down (yea)
Wid a playa from d low end, of the Chi Town
I’m dark as fuck but all ma hoes is light brown
An they jump in my balls cause I exercise wit bikes now (bikes)
BJ, Naledge, money bags that’s ma nigga Vic
Bi-bitch made niggas couldn’t ride a bike dat was fixed (no)
It’s a shame that I rap better than y’all
Some playa shit, but I’m quick to tell em “suck ma balls!” (suck it,suck it,suck it,suck it)
They love it how I dray or flex, on em bitches, they can’t go nowhere like house arrest
Chronic, lethal, my highlife is all about d tree
Smoke a fuckin house an get my hand some zees, yea

[Chorus]

[Verse 2:]
Ah, pass d tree to Vic Spencer though
Keep your bra on ma, snickers turnin them thing to hoe
I like dem attitudes, plus when she got a temper, that means she wanna fuck, yup!
Tryna take advantage an manage d money an d purse
Fuck d change dat was dangling, ah!
I told her “lil mama, dat’s a little tax money
I already took my fu-fuckin wit yo ass money!”
I love scalliwags wit big boobies, starin at me dead in ma face
Distracting me from the movie
Ma bar’s like 16 after oozin skee skee in a brawd’s face then call back ma noodies
Ooh wee! is a nigga rolling bout though
What you grandpa talkin bout smashin homos
You know d model, fuck all y’all
But I wanna pluck a chicken, cause her ass is butterball

[Chorus]

[Verse 3:]
Yea, she want dat OD, dick bartell
My ex girl, I an ma new girl be lyin down
That’s a preference, the pimpin, persistent, the mission, just keep your distance
Keep it all up like a tent is, raincoat to everglades
I can sit up in d barber chair an still never fade
Billy D I’m still smooth nigga, no Mikey Rocks but I’m cool nigga
Send ma love to other side her pillow, she weepin just like she willow, I’m sweepin up dis dinero
Got a carload in ma earlobe, mortgage on ma neck
Watch dat thing do a pendulum swing across ma, chest (chest)
Similar to Travis Best, on point wit d lyrical, cut like umbilical
Head like guillotine, you a fuckin imbecil
Ballin ma city like ma name is fuckin Kendall Gill
Aaaah, ah-ah-aah, ah-ah-aah
