[Verse 1]
Growin' up on the south-side of Chicago
I thought I was a cool kid, yes I did
Just cause I could hoop, shoot dice, and hustle
The ladies, the ladies always came callin' at me
Now that I live in LA, where the cool kids is skaters
And when I get fed up in life, I get sick of the strife
I call my nigga Maestro on the line, when I need a break
I make 'em take me where they skate

[Hook]
Yeah, cause they can't do what I do
And I can't do what they do
So I love seeing them skate, yeah
I live my dreams of skating through you

[Outro]
Yeah it kinda amazed me man, like
How they're amazed at what we do and how we come up with a track
From a kit, snare, and a hi-hat
And come up with a hit song on the radio and sell millions
And we're amazed at them how they could just you know
Ride a skateboard and do tricks and just be fresh at what they do
By being themselves, you know what I mean
Me being from Chicago, southside, I grew up in the hood with that type of crowd
For me to be in LA to see that they the cool kids
And it's something that that don't involve negativity, you know what I mean?
It's positive, it's dope for the kids, man
You know, I rocks with it man
Just the whole culture, from the way they dress to how they get down man
I respect it, no homo
