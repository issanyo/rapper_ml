[Verse 1]
Baby, I can't believe what you done to me
I'm lying here, thinking unclear
Cause you done put it on me tonight
And baby, this is going down in history
The greatest love experience we've had this far
And I'm, I'm on a high
Cause you took me for a ride and I've got to admit
That I'm stuck on your love
And now I wanna do it again, again

[Hook]
Lay your head upon my chest
While I roll a cigarette
Bodies drippin' wet
We just make good love
We just make good love
Tonight

[Verse 2]
Baby, I never want this night to end
Cause having you next to me
Is the ultimate ecstasy
And baby, there's nothing else I'd rather do
Than make sweet love to the early morn'
Cause your body is so beautiful
And I must confess
The way you workin' those hips got me so sprung on you
And I can't catch my breath
Cause girl this attraction so strong
I can't get no break

[Hook]
Lay your head upon my chest
While I roll a cigarette
Bodies drippin' wet
We just make good love
We just make good love
Tonight

[Bridge]
Aw baby
You leave me speechless girl
Your love makin' is so incredible baby
Don't wanna be without your love
Love (yeah), love (yeah), love
(Yeahhh)

[Hook]
Lay your head upon my chest
While I roll a cigarette
Bodies drippin' wet
We just make good love
We just make good love
Tonight
