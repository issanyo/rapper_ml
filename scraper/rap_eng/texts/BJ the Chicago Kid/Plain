[Verse 1]
Do you know who you are
And what you mean to me
Do you know how much I need before everything
If I had to fathom words, one million miles I would serve
And if I had to write a letter
I'd be writing her forever
How can I make it plain
Like getting wet in the rain

[Verse 2]
What I gotta do to prove
That for you my love is real
Baby step inside of me just to see how I feel
How can I make it plain
Like getting wet in the rain
Girl will that make it plain
Like getting wet in the rain

[Verse 3]
If we move in together
And I go tell your mother and your father
I will take care of you
Do I gotta get on one knee?
So all your friends and your family can see
Well I got that ring
Baby whatever it is
When I do it, Imma do it big
How can I make it plain

Do you know who you are?
What you mean to me?
