Part 1: Angels

[Choir]
Sleep under moonlight, 'til summer's gone
Gazing at stars bright, waking for the dawn
See all the angels, circle above
If you were able, you could be my love

[Choir]
Sleep under moonlight, 'til summer's gone
Gazing at stars bright, waking for the dawn
See all the angels, circle above
If you were able, you could be my love

Part 2: Your Love

[Verse: BJ The Chicago Kid]
It makes no sense
Traveling the distance
To get so far
And something's been missing
I thought I was good
But I really wasn't living
'Cause I ain't had
The feeling you're giving

[Chorus: BJ The Chicago Kid + Jack Steadman]
Thinking 'bout your love
(Now I feel it taking over me)
Thinking 'bout your love
(Now I feel it taking over me)
Thinking 'bout your love
(Now I feel it taking over me)
Baby, I need your love
(Now I feel it taking over me)
Your love
Yeah, my love
(Now I feel it taking over me)
Yeah, would you be my love? (my love?)
(Now I feel it taking over me)
My baby, b-baby, my love
(Now I feel it taking over me)
Yeah, would you be my love? (would you be)
(Now I feel it taking over me)
(Would you be) be my love, baby?
(Now I feel it taking over me)
Would you be my love?
(Now I feel it taking over me)
(Yeah, yeah) My love (be my love, baby)
(Now I feel it taking over me)
Ooh, would you be my love?
(Now I feel it taking over me)
My love?
