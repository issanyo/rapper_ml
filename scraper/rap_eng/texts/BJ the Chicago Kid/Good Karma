[Verse 1]
I wanna date all of y'all
Kiss you on the forehead 'fore you go to bed
Tell you tomorrow girl we're hitting the mall
Problem solved
Lost a few pounds, need a new fit
Got a new man, got a new whip
Got a new life now you the new shit
Wish I could make love to all of y'all
Do it to you real good like you never had
Making your mattress mad
If the walls could talk
They would call the law
Tell it all, tell it all

[Hook]
Heard you've been going through the worst
You had this coming
Well I'm not Mr fix the hurt
I'm just good karma, I'm just good karma
Heard the world's been getting on your nerves
You had this coming
Well I'm not Mr. fix the hurt
I'm just good karma, take this good karma

[Verse 2]
I hope I reach all of y'all
Whether in the dorm room or the break room or the radio in your car
Let it touch your heart
Close you eyes, take a deep breath
Picture me, touching you
Doing what you want me to
I wanna get all of y'all
In the same place on the same day
At the same time girl I ain't lying
If the walls could talk
They would call the law
And tell it all, yeah

[Hook]

[Break]
You know this is just procedure baby, you really deserve this
(You deserve everything, yeah)
You just reaping what you sewed, this is all for you baby, all for you
Karma comes in a lot of ways, and you just happen to be looking at one of 'em. So baby please, close your eyes

[Hook]
