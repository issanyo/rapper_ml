Girl we both know we
Both know we belong together
We're gonna have some kids, a house and a dog baby
And endure the stormy weather
And usually when a man realizes that this very woman
Is gonna be his last one for life
Oh this get old, relationship gets cold
And nobody seems to understand why
Things ain't going right
Girl everyday with you
Gets sweeter than the day before
Baby girl it gets sweeter
Baby
Baby girl it gets sweeter
Sweeter, yes it does
Baby girl it gets sweeter
