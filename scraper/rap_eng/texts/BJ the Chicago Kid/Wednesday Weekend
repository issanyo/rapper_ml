[Intro (2x)]
Get it, get it
Freak me just how I want

[Verse 1]
Take a look at me
I know you probably like what you see
Probably see a young G
From the C-H-I-C-A-G-O
But I'm still here to let these niggas know
In case they didn't know
No, you can't buy this from no store
I do this for my bros

[Bridge]
Baby girl ain't no tellin' what we can do when we're alone
And girl I don't know about you but me I'll be doin' the most
I think I'll sing it again

[Hook]
Ain't no tellin' what we can do when we're alone
And girl I don't know about you but me I'll be doin' the most
Girl we can make a Wednesday feel like a weekend (Do it just how I like)
I'mma gonna turn the lights off (Do it just how I like)
Girl turn your freak on (Do it just how I like)
Baby this time will be the last time
If you take your time with me (You freak me just how I like)
I'mma gonna turn the lights off (You freak me just how I like)
Girl turn your freak on (You freak me just how I like)

[Verse 2]
Look at them thighs and look at that waist
Sexy hair, pretty face, somethin' with it
And girl since our introduction all I could see is us fuckin'
When I'm in it I'mma rep my city
I'm gonna, gonna keep it on the low
Nobody, nobody's gotta know
You can't complain with me around
Nobody's gotta know

[Bridge (1x) + Hook (2x)]

[Outro]
And when we done I'mma tell you to just find somethin'
How I know you freak me girl (You freak me just how I like)
In case you freaky, know
And girl only a freak could freak me (You freak me just how I like)
Started from the back, that's a trap
But a nigga love that (You freak me just how I like)
Hope it ain't just this time, or bed time (You freak me just how I like)

Ain't no tellin' what we can do when we're alone
And girl I don't know about you but me I'll be doin' the most
(You freak me just how I like)
