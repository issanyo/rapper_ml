[Hook : BJ The Chicago Kid and Kaye Fox]
We do this all day everyday because we popping
Niggas in the hood yeah they never forgotten
Hold the same nine because you know that we popping
Same niggas I pray with all day because we popping
Popping, popping they know that Im popping
Drop it lock it nigga yeah you know I get it popping
Got my city popping and you know that we never stopping
Popping, popping they never forgotten

[Verse 1 : Jallal]
Im torn apart
Baby make it hard
She wanna hit the club but my heart with Allah
Baby is a fiend got my soul so tired
If she keep it up she gets dropped like a call
She don't ever stop, now she wanna hit the mall
I guess no biggie right more money more problems
Wish I gave the wrong number
Wish I never trust her
Don’t know my birthday but know the numbers to my card
No reason she say I don't care about a nigga caught up in his feelings
She ain't got no empathy at all no lie
Pretend it never happened but I remember the day you played me

[Hook : BJ The Chicago Kid and Kaye Fox]
We do this all day everyday because we popping
Niggas in the hood yeah they never forgotten
Hold the same nine because you know that we popping
Same niggas I pray with all day because we popping
Popping, popping they know that Im popping
Drop it lock it nigga yeah you know I get it popping
Got my city popping and you know that we never stopping
Popping, popping they never forgotten
Verse
And its foolish I know, but my heart still getting broke
You make me feel the fire, feel the fire
This place about to blow!
Da, Oh badadadada
Oh badada
Oh Badadadadada
