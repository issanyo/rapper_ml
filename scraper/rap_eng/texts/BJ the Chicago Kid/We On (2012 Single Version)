[Verse 1: Marcus Orelias]

Marcus Orelias, come with me or get left
Why like me? Your girl been stressed
Past dresses motivated bars I bench-pressed
Dropping science till the bell rang, shoes had holes so I felt the pain
Got played, so I don’t play, pockets got fat so she knows my name (ooo weee)
Do they hit my line, coming quick and I love it
J.J. mixed so I spit sick throw up you spine
Give me a millisecond or a kiloton; I’ll R.I.P. this at instance
I moonwalk on sentences till I free birds with sentences in a few days
Been a minute and a long way, reminiscing on my old ways
And I love the way she move that thing but hey
Hands on her hips she lick her lips when she see’s me flow
She don’t know yearned for hype they said no, so I became my own
Now what I need is TLC or P&P till I TNT, get high and won't come down
Cause they know the sound when I come around
From that Rebel Of the Underground
Wassup

[Hook: BJ the Chicago Kid]

You must be a fool to think that I ain't on
And if you think I ain't on, nigga you must not be on
Cause we on (until hook ends)
