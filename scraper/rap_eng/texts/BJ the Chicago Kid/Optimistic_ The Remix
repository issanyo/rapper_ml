[Intro: Kirk Franklin]
When life gets dark it's easy to forget that the sun never leaves us
But we leave the sun, see it's cyclical
The sun sets and it rises, because the Earth moves away from it
A lot of times we can move our eyes from the light
But if you stand still, when it's dark I promise you that the sun will rise again
It's guaranteed, because it's been dark before
That's why weeping may endure for a night, but joy does come in the morning
Lets go

[Verse 1: Kierra Sheard]

You can't see up when looking down
A brighter day tomorrow will bring
