[Chorus]
When I shine you shine with me baby
Our love, it burns that deep
When I shine you shine with me baby
Shine bright for the whole world to see
When I shine you shine with me baby
My love, it burns that deep
When I shine, you shine
Baby we shine

[Verse 1]
When I think about the two of us
It’s not perfect but it’s just for me
I see you smiling now
It’s like a dream but far from make believe
We argue and fight, but girl you stay by my side
And even when we loving you still give it to me like it’s nothing
Even when you knew that I was a lie
For me you put up a fight
And baby I don’t know how we do it but we always stand the rain

[Chorus]
When I shine you shine with me baby
Our love, it burns that deep
When I shine you shine with me baby
Shine bright for the whole world to see
When I shine you shine with me baby
My love, it burns that deep
When I shine, you shine
Baby we shine

[Verse 2]
Baby they don’t nothing about our love, no
No they don’t know nothing about us
They don’t know nothing about love, no

[Bridge]
And girl I know that you go through so much hell for me when you ain’t around me
They call you crazy say you less than a lady but you still my baby
They don’t know the feeling we feel when we’re alone and the world stands still
'Cause when I look in your eyes girl I see the truth and the truth is I’m nothing without you

When I shine you shine with me baby
My love it burns that deep
When I shine you shine with me baby
Baby we shine

When I shine you shine with me baby
My love it burns that deep
When I shine you shine with me baby
Shine bright for the whole world to see
