[Intro: Bjrnck]
Can't explain why your lovin' makes me weak
Can't explain why your lovin' makes me weak

[Verse 1: Brian Fresco]
Yeah, whenever you want me
Whenever you call, whenever you're horny
I'll be your pony
I'll be your homie, call me your hombre
Only we know it, what we be doing
Licking that lovely, stroking, you moaning
Whenever you lonely
Whenever you lonely
(Whenever I'm lonely)
Just hit up my phone, we'll talk about homie
Then when I'm touring
(Then when you're touring)
Don't mean to be boring
Or like I'm holdin', really just moldin'
'Cause, girl, you a trophy
(Boy, I'm a trophy)
Just need to be golden
(Need to be golden)
And I'm tired of these hoes just thought you should know that

[Refrain: Bjrnck and BJ the Chicago Kid]
Can't explain why your lovin' makes me weak
(Baby, I don't know)
Can't explain why your lovin' makes me weak
(I can't explain, I can't explain)

[Verse 2: Brian Fresco]
However you want it
I'll flip it, I'll lick it, I'll kiss it, I'll hit it
The minute I'm on it
(The minute you on it)
All up in that monkey
Actin' a donkey
Wish you could clone me
(Wish you could clone me)
'Cause you know you can't own me
You so sick of this rollin'
Stone, rollin' down stony
Leavin' you lonely
But whenever you lonely
(Whenever I'm lonely)
Just to turn to this song
I'll sing to you slow
So leave for the call me
(Leave for the call me)
'Cause you know you can't call me
Feelings just fallin'
Money just stallin'
'Cause whenever we argue
Girl, you know that I start
You wanna be part, but I can't 'cause I'm locked
'Cause the bitch got the key to my heart
(Can't explain why your lovin' makes me weak)
That pussy be tasting like water
And whenever you call, girl, I slaughter
If you get it, you know Fresco taught her
I train all of my bitches, Coach Carter
I swear that's what these bitches should call 'em
'Cause they know when my team full of ballers
From the bottom, but niggas we toppin'
How this topics, now we toxic
To these rappers who rap with no topics
So, baby, no need for the talkin'
Just get topless
All that nonsense
Girl, it obvious you with the money team
Girl, I thought

[Refrain: Bjrnck and BJ the Chicago Kid]
Can't explain why your lovin' makes me weak
(Somethin' 'bout everything you do to me, baby)
Can't explain why your lovin' makes me weak
(It's drivin' me out of my mind tryna figure out what you do to me, baby)
Can't explain why your lovin' makes me weak
(Yeah)
Can't explain why your lovin' makes me weak
(I'm not, I'm not finding knowing what I'm sayin' 'bout you, baby)
Sayin' 'bout me, baby

[Outro: BJ the Chicago Kid and Bjrnck]
Yeah, can't explain why your lovin' makes me weak
(Why your lovin' makes me weak)
Ohh can't explain, can't explain
(Can't explain, can't explain, can't explain)
No, no, matter of fact I'm on way to you, baby
(Oh, baby, your lovin' makes me weak, me weak, yeah)
