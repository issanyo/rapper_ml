[Chorus: BJ The Chicago Kid]
She say she wanna drink, do drugs and have sex tonight
But I got church in the mornin', church in the mornin'
She say she wanna drink, do drugs and have sex tonight
But I got church in the mornin', church in the mornin'

[Verse 1: Ty Dolla $ign]
Hope they got a heaven for a real one
Hopin' God forgive me, 'bout to kill some
Brown skin chick with some thick 'ol thighs
Told me she in love, that's a big 'ol lie
Hit it last night, now she back tonight
Said her boyfriend couldn't get it right
Kissin' all on it while I blow that strong
Knowin' damn well we both dead wrong
But it feels good so it's okay, yeah it's alright
You got heaven in between your thighs, don't look me in the eye
I'ma say shit I don't mean and I hate when I do that
Blamin' it on the molly or the weed or that 1942, yeah

[Chorus: BJ The Chicago Kid]
She say she wanna drink, do drugs and have sex tonight
But I got church in the mornin', church in the mornin'
She say she wanna drink, do drugs and have sex tonight
But I got church in the mornin', church in the mornin'

[Verse 2: Anderson .Paak]
Flippin' through the pages of the Old Testament
Like baby, don't test me
I grew up in the pulpits
But I was on the drum stool, riffin' and groovin
And every Sunday you the best dressin'
But I don't know who you foolin
As soon as the preacher stop hoopin'
I'ma get the car warmed up and come scoop yah
I'ma pray to god the reverend don't shoot me
I should put a lot more pause in my movement
I never touched it but good lord, have mercy
The lord is my shepherd he knows what I want
The devil on my shoulder
Tell me I should take you for shots of Patr√≥n
And take you to Bible study in the mornin'
The angel said to leave that man's wife alone
He payin' the save souls
I just went home then

[Chorus: BJ The Chicago Kid]
She say she wanna drink, do drugs and have sex tonight
But I got church in the mornin', church in the mornin'
She say she wanna drink, do drugs and have sex tonight
But I got church in the mornin', church in the mornin'

[Verse 3: BJ The Chicago Kid]
Hopefully we can go to Heaven
Baby girl understand that the plan is to win like the boys in '97
Ecstacy all night, baby girl
Hopefully you can call the reverend
Hopefully he friends with Melvin
From the Blue Notes tell him bring two smokes
And a shot of Hen', drive his Benz back to heaven
Cause baby you, got what I want and baby you know it
And every time you walk by, baby I can tell you just can't control it
A nigga done fell in love with the preacher's daughter
I know we shouldn't but we both oughta
Do it again, Lord forgive us for our sins

[Chorus: BJ The Chicago Kid]
She say she wanna drink, do drugs and have sex tonight
But I got church in the mornin', church in the mornin'
She say she wanna drink, do drugs and have sex tonight
But I got church in the mornin', church in the mornin'

[Outro: Buddy]
Hopefully we can go to heaven
(I pray) Hopefully we go to heaven
(We can go to hell) Hopefully we can go to heaven
(I Pray) Hopefully we can go to heaven
Hopefully we can go to heaven
