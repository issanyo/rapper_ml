[Hook: BJ The Chicago Kid & Kelechi]
I gave my all
I said my peace
I fly, I fall
I stretch, I reach
This is holy ground
Lord bless my feet
I work this land
Till I rest in peace
Amen
I don glo'd up
Aye young nigga glo'd up (x2)
Sho nuff, aye young nigga glo’d up
I don glo’d up
Young nigga glo’d up

[Verse 1: Kelechi]
Run along, run along now
Did it all, get a call, break a law, rip a bong now
Stand it all till you fall down
Squeaky clean till you started verbing with the wrong nouns
So who you gonna call now
Niggas go ghost when you busted
They leaking through the walls now
Hold your lady down, she done put up with it all now
Ring up on her finger and her body in a long gown
I never saw myself growing up
This mind ain't big enough for the both of us
I used to open up
Thinking I was close enough
Tryna get a buzz and niggas begging me to sober up
Hop up on a locomotive track I'm goin' coconuts
Going coast to coast with all the folks who did the most for us
Push the envelope and hit a lick my nigga close it up
And pray to God that you dope enough
Dab on'em
Ride slow like you crawling up in Dallas in a slab on'em
Don't push the gas on'em
All you got is your words and you gotta hang your hat on'em
Son shinin’, stuntin’ like my dab on’em
The college dropout came back with some class on them
Started stuntin’ like a grad on them
Givin’ everything I had on them
I gave

[Hook: BJ The Chicago Kid & Kelechi]
I gave my all
I said my peace
I fly, I fall
I stretch, I reach
This is holy ground
Lord bless my feet
I work this land
Till I rest in peace
Amen
I don glo'd up
Aye young nigga glo'd up (x2)
Sho nuff, aye young nigga glo’d up
I don glo’d up
Young nigga glo’d up

[Outro: Kelechi]
You see. I’m done giving people the option whether or not they gon' see me shine. Whether they gon' see me fly. Whether or not they gon' see me glow. Nah, you gon' see me glow. You gon' watch me glow. Cause I done gave my all. I said my peace. You see, I don't fly. I fall and I stretch and I reach.  This right here is holy ground. The Lord has blessed my feet and I will work this land until the day that I rest in peace and the church said Amen
So you gon' watch me shine
And then you gon' watch me glow
You gon' watch me fly!
You gon' watch me fly!
You gon' watch me glow!
You gon' watch that black boy fly!
Watch that black boy fly!
Watch that black boy glow!
Watch that black boy glow!
Whooo!
Watch that black boy glow!
What he said?!
What he said?!
Watch that black boy glow!
Yeah! Watch that black boy glow!
(Amen!)
