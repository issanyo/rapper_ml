What do ya say girl
Who are you playing with
I'm that dude girl
But I don't be saying shit
Yeah thats me girl chilling in the back
And when you talk to me yeah I talk back now girl
That's my steez
Yeah that's why you love me, cause I do me
Now, girl

The exactly same reason why you wanna do me girl

LOL smiley face, girl I know you type that
Cause I hit it so good you'll be right back
Baby girl it's like that

And I don't mean to be rude
But baby girl, tonight I'mma be bullying you

Tonight girl you gonna surrender
Tonight girl you gonna surrender
Gimme your all
Gimme your all
Shit-talking ain't doing nothing
Shawty it don't mean a thing
Girl, don't hold nothing back
Gimme your all
Gimme your all

Next time that you with a girl and after sex
First question's "what's next?"
Then you move on to the next one
Ain't no way in the world she could've gave you her all

What about when she don't arch it right
She just can't take the pipe
Grabbing sheets like crazy
Maybe she need a pillow to bite

Shit, the Big Payback
Don't say shit, baby girl lay back
Watch your head
Remember everything that you said
Here go to bed, baby girl take that
Yeah, it's the big payback, the big payback
