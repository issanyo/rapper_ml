Lyrics

V1:

Giant arms that encapsulate the captain of the ship, I capture the comrades catapulting off the cliff, its reaction I'm a kraken attacking and scratching your name off of the list, my rein rains like Poseidon is writing all of my shit, change, but ooh

My dick hangs, you know, my switchblade to yo pit stains then go, click bang

Shooting out poems like uzis use these usually to dismantle your mandible (this way) till I get my pay nigga

V2:

Can’t you see that I’m contemplating reversing the conversation of verses with condemnation, this nation of constant hating, its blatant, if they can care less about money making, and reagan is greatly mistaking, thanking the making of the hating is from the others covered out

Keeping us out, locking us down, I’m about to be out of reality while

I’m good with The man upstairs, no but he cannot bare to witness, all of the gifted

Giving up all of the water to all of the fishes

V3:

Stuck with the worst of people just because the diamonds and gold, climbing the pole, though knowing I can lighten the load

I’ve been drilling, chilling, still in killing mode, and I take it that you know my empire’s, gonna’s be the talking of the, time, but I gotta get it right, till I make it to the sky, and the birds, and the bees, and the trees , I will just leave it behind

So relax, find a blessing when you think a each day, bj, can you take it over for me nigga
