[Intro: BJ The Chicago Kid]

Said ya never know what's gonna happen next dog so you know you gotta be ready
Even when the ground start to shake dog, hold the wheel tight, strong and steady
The objective is to keep from... Goin under
And when you realize that you're okay... That's when you fly away

[Verse 1: Lil G]

Uh! Spread my wings as I let loose
Competition nada, all the naysayers jet fuel
Just move nigga this my victory dance
Arms crossed head back, this my victory stance
If you niggas got a problem with it
Tilt head back and gargle with it
G is just a monster with it
Spit it till I'm outta here
Mixed in with this confidence
Is work ethic and common sense
Fool with the Heat, so stop acting so Cavalier
Uh! So while ya TVs on channel hate
I stay above the smoke like a mantel place
At ya table, nah nigga we don't ask a place
We just kick the legs off and stuff our face
Life is on the right track, nigga check the ticket stub
Cuz when have everything, ya still missin much
But I'm here now, and you done watch me grind
This when wait until, becomes watch me shine

[Breakdown: Lil G]
I look to the sky to keep me grounded
If your ego is a drug, don't overdose
Always throw my last dime in the fountain
Cuz the future ain't written so ya neva know

[Hook: BJ The Chicago Kid]
Aaahh, Said ya never know what's gonna happen next dog so you know you gotta be ready
Even when the ground start to shake dog, hold the wheel tight, strong and steady
The objective is to keep from... Goin under
And when you realize that you're okay... That's when you fly away

[Verse 2: Q]

I'm mobbin through my switchin gears in a dunk named desire, I don't let nobody steer
Mind over matter, attitude pioneer, not a sucka among us, all alphas over here
Leanin off the pier and the devil puttin weight on me
I just took a step back, brush my fade on him
It's a different type of love, so they hate on us
Fightin all out lives, Lord please shed some grace on us
I think I seen the sun too many times
So I'm runnin at it hard I think I'm runnin out of time
Goin for the alley, but they scared to the drop the dime
My two cents, made mo sense (cents), now everything in line
If life is a battle, then the battle is defined
By the passion in your heart and the path of your mind
So keep your eyes open when you running through the fire
Cuz the very thing you lookin for is on the other side

[Breakdwon: Q]
This the road less traveled
You gotta go out there and take it
This where the rubber meets the road
Cuz it's more about the journey when you're headed for the bacon
