[Verse 1: Chance The Rapper]
Keep ya head away from windows
Keep your arms inside the ride
Trust me with ya body, trust me with ya life
Banging on the windows, baby come inside
Certainly in trouble, maybe you should hide
I'mma tell you like

[Chorus: Chance The Rapper]
Don't you look up to me, don't trust a word I say
Don't you end up like me, if you learn one thing today (naw naw naw naw)
Don't you look up to me, don't trust a word I say (no, no)
Don't you end up like me, if you learn one thing today
