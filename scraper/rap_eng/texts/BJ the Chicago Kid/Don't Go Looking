[Verse 1: BJ The Chicago Kid]
Oh lately it ain't been the same
You don't even call me no more
To check on me like how was my day
Sometimes laying next to you feels strange
I feel like you've exchanged
The old you for somebody with the same name
Grandmomma always said be careful
Cause what you're looking for
Could show up at the frond and backdoor
Now I've gotten my back up against the wall
And I never though another love would be the reason for our downfall

[Hook: BJ The Chicago Kid]
And if you're looking for a heart I'll tell a lie
And if you're looking for a heart I'll say goodbye
And if you're looking for another man
To come mess up you plans
And take the girl that you've got
And if you don't think she'll come home
An dyou think that you're gonna have to do it on your own
Don't go looking ' cause you may just find it
Don't go looking 'cause you may just find it

[Verse 2: BJ The Chicago Kid]
If you looking through her cellphone, you gon' learn
Cause I know from experience
You play with fire then you gon' get burned
In her face and what you've heard
But don't know
I can tell you over and over
But don't let the hard way be the way you gotta go

[Hook: BJ The Chicago Kid]
And if you're looking for a heart I'll tell a lie
And if you're looking for a heart I'll say goodbye
And if you're looking for another man
To come mess up you plans
And take the girl that you've got
And if you don't think she'll come home
An dyou think that you're gonna have to do it on your own
Don't go looking ' cause you may just find it
Don't go looking 'cause you may just find it

[Bridge: BJ The Chicago Kid]
To every question there's an answer
But how bad do you wanna know the answer
To every question there's an answer
But how bad do you wanna know the answer
To every question there's an answer
But how bad do you wanna know the answer
Don't go looking 'cause you may just find it

[Hook: BJ The Chicago Kid]
And if you're looking for a heart I'll tell a lie
And if you're looking for a heart I'll say goodbye
And if you're looking for another man
To come mess up you plans
And take the girl that you've got
And if you don't think she'll come home
An dyou think that you're gonna have to do it on your own
Don't go looking ' cause you may just find it
Don't go looking 'cause you may just find it

[Outro: Sample (?)]
Come on Anna May don't go nowhere now
Don't leave me by myself
I can't be by myself tonight
(But Larry she's your wife)
No we ain't married, we ain't never been married
I just can't make her happy no more
(Things change I mean maybe
Y'all can work it out)
She did the worst thing she could do to anybody like me
