[Intro]
How many of y'all out there know about the soul of a woman?
I'm not talkin' 'bout a soul, soul, I'm talking 'bout, hah
How many of you really know about the soul of a woman
What makes her tick and toc, and things combined to make her to woman she is today, for you, for me. Listen

[Verse 1]
You get your smile from your mom
You kinda walk like your auntie
Daddy girl, you hate the drama
But you get your dimples from your granny
Like a queen girl you got swag
But all the other girls they hate that
You're strong like your grand daddy
Nothing's perfect but you make me happy

[Pre-Hook]
Cause girl you, got that fire burnin' down in my soul
With you, by my side feels like I'll never grow old

[Hook] (x2)
I'm talking 'bout the soul of a woman
So good to see
That it feels so good to be loved by you
And a wonderful place to be

[Verse 2]
You learn to cook from your granny
But you're gettin' mad like your auntie
Home remedies from your mom
But she get 'em all from your granny
Your my queen so you got swag
But all the other girls they hate that
You're strong like your grand daddy
Nothing's perfect but you make me happy

[Pre-Hook] + [Hook] (x2)

[Interlude]

On guitar
Our very own
