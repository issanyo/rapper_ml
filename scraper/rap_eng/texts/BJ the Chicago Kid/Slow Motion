[Intro: BJ The Chicago Kid]
You know I, you know I take my time, don't lose my mind
It's all intact 'cause every time, they see me shine
It's like callin' back that time work, that's how it goes
It come with my roll to make control
Livin' fast while I'm whippin' slow

[Verse 1: Oktane]
Ridin' in silence, nothin' but the city boomin'
I am livin' improvement, I just kick it and prove it
I be stickin' and movin', known for chiefin' and groovin'
This is really my life and your nigga really be losin'
Your girls really be textin', sayin' what they seen what they witnessed
Your girls really need niggas, hobbies, and they own business
You know my life movin' fast as these women all focused on the winners
Since you met me I been gettin' it
I know a couple things ain't pan out
Through everything I still stand out
Never took handouts, I never gave handouts
And I give it to you when you want it
Then my life get to doin' a hunnid
And that's when my plane land
And I get everything yeah

[Hook: BJ The Chicago Kid]
You know I, you know I take my time, don't lose my mind
It's all intact 'cause every time, they see me shine
It's like callin' back that time work, that's how it goes
It come with my roll to make control
Livin' fast while I'm whippin' slow motion
Slow motion, slow motion
Livin' fast while I'm whippin' slow motion
Slow motion, slow motion

[Verse 2: Price]
I'ma turn my phone off, you'll get all my time baby
Ain't no need to rush it, we can take our time baby
Can't deny your energy got me vibratin'
Tell me anything but just don't tell me lies baby
Yeah gotta take life slow, gotta let the dice roll
Solo on them rides home
Tryna duck the five-o on them streets T-2 died for
TC died for
I look up to the sky in pain
Can't let the homies die in vain
All my enemies wanna catch me slip
Cops kilin' and arrestin' kids
You know in every single text I get
Cause ain't no message in the messages
I use to wanna flip my neck and wrist with a naked bitch
And a spot at the top that was definite
Now I just want excellence
For me and my people I take a hit and move slow

[Hook: BJ The Chicago Kid]
You know I, you know I take my time, don't lose my mind
It's all intact 'cause every time, they see me shine
It's like callin' back that time work, that's how it goes
It come with my roll to make control
Livin' fast while I'm whippin' slow motion
Slow motion, slow motion
Livin' fast while I'm whippin' slow motion
Slow motion, slow motion
