[Intro]
Life is a gamble, oh baby
Where you win or lose
Life is a gamble

[Hook: BJ the Chicago Kid]
They say life (is a gamble)
So be careful when you shake em up, shake em up, shake em up, shake em
Shake em up, shake em up, shake em up, shake em
They say life (is a gamble)
So be careful when you shake em up, shake em up, shake em up, shake em
Shake em up, shake em up, shake em up, shake em

[Verse 1: Big KRIT]
I roll the dice one time for my folks that died off
Rep the side they believe in but they side lost
Let me toss a seven for the ones won't see tomorrow
Cash those chips in for some time we don't need to ball
Gunshots ran out, everybody hang out
Yellow tape party, all over we sang out
I don't like this feeling, ain't nothing that appealing
Bout reminiscing, over you, my God
I couldn't cry cause your mama couldn't stop crying
And that's hard, lord I wish my folks would stop dying
But who am I to say it wasn't your time to black out?
You betted all on a spot, I guess you crapped out
For the finer things, indeed we chase
We told you pace yourself
It's funny, how the things we love, can make us hate ourselves
Russian roulette table, I gotta bet safer
You gotta know when to fold your cards
When you ain't able to reach into that dash when that
Jackal up and flashed that, brass like
Give me all you got or that's your ass
That's all that it would took, the house got me shook
Cause ain't no point spread, but god doing books

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Big KRIT]
Life is a gamble feel like I'm rambling sometimes
Like what the fuck I'm sposed to say in this rhyme
I shed tears and they won't come back
I said the word and they won't run back
My slot machine was broken this time
Ain't no tokens, I can't redeem to preserve the focus of mine
So many died and I'm scared it's just a matter of time
For I'm lifted myself, six people I know
Ain't been in church in a while, I heard I reap what I sow
Casket close, Caddy doors, can't commemorate
This tracks my gurney, my verse can be the ventilator
So I breathe, cause Loathing in Las Vegas wasn't meant for me
Too scared I'll stay too long and forget where I'm really meant to be
Heaven maybe, heaven lately, but all these lights are captivating
I had to play it, for the sake of me and mine
Lord, I pray I hit it big this time

[Hook]
