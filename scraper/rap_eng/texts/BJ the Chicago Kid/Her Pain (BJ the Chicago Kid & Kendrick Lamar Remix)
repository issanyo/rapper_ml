[Intro]
This is the way I feel

[Verse]
Iâ€™m from the Murder Mitten where murder killed religion
Where Stevie first sew that ribbon onto a million pistons
Liquor store next to churches, you call it juxtaposition
Where being black and distinct is on the brink of extinction
This affliction is like a supervision
Lack of inspiration, too much television
Me call it a dummy box for a reason
Ma turned it off and said "please go and get some ambition"
She played a good villain, always spoke with conviction
Protecting us from gang bangers and politicians
Taught me about strong men and about strong black women
Ms Angelou, Ms Parks, Ms Truth, Chaka Khan
But not Oprah cause she only helped the black people in Africa

So why, why
So why am I here with blood dripping from my nose
Fear running down my face
My lovers hands grabbing my throat?
Unprovoked, he choked our love and trust out of me
Baron of any emotion on the floor he left me
19 years old, all I saw was 19 year flash before me
So that night I smoked 2 joints, stole a fifth for myself and made a toast to infidelity
Broken and lonely I drink to blur these thoughts
Hoping that you will show me

[Hook]
And I don't know why you keep blessing me
I don't know why you keep blessing me
I don't know why you keep blessing me
I don't know why you keep blessing me
I don't know why, I don't know why, I don't know why
And I don't know why you keep blessing me
I don't know why you keep blessing me
I don't know why you keep blessing me
I don't know why you keep blessing me
I don't know why, I don't know why, I don't know why

But you keep on, but you keep on, blessing me

[Hook]
And I don't know why you keep blessing me
I don't know why you keep blessing me
I don't know why you keep blessing me
I don't know why you keep blessing me
I don't know why, I don't know why, I don't know why
And I don't know why you keep blessing me
I don't know why you keep blessing me
I don't know why you keep blessing me
I don't know why you keep blessing me
I don't know why, I don't know why, I don't know why

Hey thank you Jesus

[Outro]
Lord help me
Cause I need you
I know this weed is burning
And I'm on drink number two
Lord help me
Cause I need you
I know this weed is burning
And I'm on drink number two
