[Intro: Rosewood 2055]
Paint an image of your mind
That's the weapon
The world's your canvas
Share your expression
Just free your mind
That's the weapon
The world's your canvas
Share your expression

[Verse 1: Young RJ]
Yeah, I need extra help when I express myself
So you should come along with your sexy self
And I can only imagine how your exes felt
She can’t keep her pants on, she need an extra belt
Bend corners in my black jeep, look at me creep
Thick bitch in a blue body suit, that look like mystique
Your technique is kind of unique, its easy to sleep
And it's easy to get me off, cause your reverence is deep
How you doin'? Monumental
Your sexual confidence is confidential
You sit behind the desk, cross your legs and hold the pencil
Never tell it to the - cause I know there be potential
Please believe, I want you in a special way
If your body is a temple heres a special place
No haste, no waste, less less on my case
And I don’t need to go fast to express the way

[Hook: BJ the Chicago Kid]
This for my sexy ladies
Independent
From all around the world
I love sexy women
And all my beautiful ladies
I love what you’re doing
And when you hear this song
Free your mind

[Verse 2: T3]
Yeah, [?] it was not impenetrable
I ain't talking touching genitals like most men would do
Tryna reach your pinnacle, you're so non-typical
Sexual individual who smart with the spiritual
Yeah, your about your biz you gotta love it
Most complain and never got the guts to rise above it
Explain how it is, how you does or how you doesn't
Stress stay retained like a case of bad luggage
Yeah, high self and high esteem
Plus you got a air that’s kind of rare, you entice these
They trying to steal your heart, you got it locked, they ain't got keys
They want to beat the box, you tell them “Nah, this is not free”
Let me breathe, exquisite mix it with some solid traditions
In my opinion, see the difference, they can’t finish your sentences
They just bitches, you out the ordinary
This is my commentary to get you laid out on my itinerary

[Hook: BJ the Chicago Kid]

[Bridge: BJ the Chicago Kid and (Illa J)]
(Yeah, use those words effectively)
And move that body sexually
C’mon, move, girl, c'mon, move, girl
(Yeah, use those words effectively)
And move that body sexually
C’mon, move, girl, c'mon, move, girl
Free your mind

[Verse 3: Illa J]
And release that stress and you will be free
To live a life filed with love, no misery
And you will be healed by love so easily
And float on the clouds above, so peacefully
But first you gotta sh-show me what you feeling right now
Be transparent so I can see clearly
Just like I’m speaking right now, I know you hear me
Even though I’m thinking out loud, I’m thinking clearly
And I write what I feel that’s why they fear me
I just need space to express so I don’t care if they cheer me
I hope you’re hearing this lesson, cause I’m explaining the theory
Of how to clearly express everything you are feeling
