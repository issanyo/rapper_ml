[Verse 1]
Come follow me
I've got something special to see
You can finally be where you should be
Just come follow me
Don't you know your [?]
[?]
Exactly where you should be
Gon' get your mind right
[?] make sure your wheels tight
Fly straight and have faith in [?]

[Pre-Chorus]
And when you really make it
Remember you can go too far
The power's in your hands to change it
You can be the hand to reach out
The dark

[Chorus]
Say it, come follow me
I was here the whole time, and it was just you and me
Come follow me
Come follow me
Come follow me
Come follow me

[Verse 2]
You're moving strong now
You've been through the water and the fire
A fighter, it's your time now
I've heard a million no's
I just one yes

[Pre-Chorus]
And when you really make it
Remember you can go too far
The power's in your hands to change it
You can be the hand to reach out
The dark

[Chorus]
Say it, come follow me
I was here the whole time, and it was just you and me
Come follow me
Come follow me

[Ending]
Come follow me
I've got something special to see
You can finally be where you should be
Just come follow me
