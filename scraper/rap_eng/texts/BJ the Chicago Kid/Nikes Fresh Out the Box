[Intro]
Ain't nothing like
A pair of fresh all white air force ones
And I said to myself. I got to have

Got to have her like nikes fresh out the box

[Verse 1]
Everybody want to know her name
Its like she walked right out a dream
A fantasy unreal
Dear god sent me an angel
Shes like no one I ever seen
No one I ever met
Someone I'll never forget
Looking at her is good for my health
She got me singing to myself

[Hook]
I see her
I want her
Got to have her like (Nikes fresh out the box)
Im fading
Day dreaming
Got to have her like (Nikes fresh out the box)
I won't scuff her up. I'll lace her up right
Treat her real good like a pair of fresh white hi top or low tops
I got to have them white nikes fresh out the box

Ay yay ay yay (ay yay ay yay)
Ay yay ay yay (ay yay ay yay)
Ay yay ay yay ay yay (ay yay ay yay ay yay)
Ay yay ay yay ay yay (ay yay ay yay ay yay)

[Verse 2]
I really don't want to waste time
Trying to hook up wit a dyme
Because im checkin out a dollar
Thats making me want to holla

Someone I'll never forget
Looking at her is good for my health
She got me singing to my self
