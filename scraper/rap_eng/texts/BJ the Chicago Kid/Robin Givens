Backshots no ass shots

All up in the farm tryin to bring her pass slot
Cause that head us good

She throw her hair up in a bun and keep it real hood
She deserve finest put me out like baby in a bonnett
Got a tight schedule but we get around it
Little bit of hennessy little bit a chronic

That mouth gon get a ear studded
Shit so real hard to keep on my bucket
Drop a thug tear for it

Expensive gifts that bitch love paper, me too
But for right now it’s bottom lip biting and fuck faces
She like you ain't ready you holdin that covers like Robin’s & Eddie

She like it rules to this shit, I admire the fly
But when the feeling get to intense
Nigga it’s pimp or die

[Bridge:]
Put that ass right here[x3]
Oh yea right here, right here, right here
Right here, yea
Baby show me how you move it
Oh yea right here, right here, right here
Gon lose control


[Chorus]
