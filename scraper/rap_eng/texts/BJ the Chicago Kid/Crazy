[Intro]
In my mind I am crazy, crazy about the right things. Crazy about the things that could change my life and honestly if you ain't crazy about something, I can't rock with you. So at the end of the day man, get crazy about something

[Background vocals] (repeating)
C-R-A-Z-Y

[Verse 1]
Close your eyes to see everything that you can't do
It's not that hard, you can do anything you want to

[Hook]
It's cra-, I'm cra- it's crazy now
I'm cra-, it's cra-, I'm crazy now
It's cra-, I'm cra- it's crazy now
I'm cra-, it's cra-, I'm crazy now
It's cra-, I'm cra- it's crazy now
I'm cra-, it's cra-, I'm crazy now

[Verse 2]
I never ever let nobody tell me what I can't do
Just because you could not care, nigga fuck you

[Hook]
It's cra-, I'm cra- it's crazy now
I'm cra-, it's cra-, I'm crazy now
It's cra-, I'm cra- it's crazy now
I'm cra-, it's cra-, I'm crazy now
It's cra-, I'm cra- it's crazy now
I'm cra-, it's cra-, I'm crazy now
It's cra-, I'm cra- it's crazy now
(Don't never ever let nobody tell you what you can't do)
I'm cra-, it's cra-, I'm crazy now
('Cause when it all falls down only you can blame you)
It's cra-, I'm cra- it's crazy now
(Don't never ever let nobody tell you what you can't do)
I'm cra-, it's cra-, I'm crazy now
('Cause when it all falls down only you can blame you)
Blame you, blame you

[Outro]
Don't never ever let nobody tell you what you can't do
Just because you could not care, nigga fuck you
