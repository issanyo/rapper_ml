[Intro]
Yeah, that's right babe
That's right babe
That's right babe, yeah
That's right babe
That's right babe
That's right babe

[Verse 1: Ro James]
You be acting like you on one
You be acting like you don't want it
How you gon lie to me?
Don't lie, stay a hundred and put something on it
Lil' something like you on top of me right now
Breathing on me and I'm breathing on you
It's like making love, but it's more like making magic
We be stopping traffic
We be going this hard

[Chorus: Ro James]
Oh, but you already knew that
But you already knew that
You, you already knew that, girl
You already knew that
But you already knew that
You-you probably knew that girl yeah

[Verse 2: BJ The Chicago Kid]
I could tell that she didn't know it
Didn't know that I had the bomb, baby
Stepped on that bed like a land mine
You get yours 'fore I get mine
Girl, it's kinda like that every time
Purple raindrops fallin' on my head
I must be dead 'cause
The feeling I feel's just like heaven
Baby, oh, baby, angel already knew

[Chorus: BJ The Chicago Kid]
Say you already knew that
You already knew that
You know that I love it
Make a nigga wanna touch it
Turn that around and start fucking

[Chorus: Ro James]
Oh, you already knew that
You already knew that, girl
You already knew that

That's about that, I ain't sayin' no more
'Bout it be about it, don't explain no more
I ain't playing no more games no more
No no no
But you already knew that
You know I don’t fuck around
You already knew that
Baby go ahead, pull them panties down
Never mind, lemme do that
That's mine, lemme do that
I’ll be gentle when I do that
I know you like it when I do that
You my only one babe
You make me feel some type of way
I need your body all day
I'm like a young Marvin in his hey'
(Oh baby, I can't fight this feeling)
(No no no no no, no no no no)

[Chorus: Ro James]
But you already knew that
Oh, you already knew that
But you already knew that
You, you already knew that girl
You already knew that
But you already knew that
You-you probably knew that girl, yeah

[Verse 3: Ro James]
Now let me hear that thing speak back (Speak back)
'Cause I need a little feedback (Feedback)
I won't leave, won't leave you (Leave you)
But if I do, imma be back (Be back)
I won't leave, never leave you (Leave you)
But if I do, imma speed back (Speed back)
I'm in the V with the seat back (Seat back)
Fuck the police 'cause I need that
Real right, real right
Imma fiend and I mean that

[Chorus: Ro James]
But you already knew that
You already knew that
You already knew that girl
You already knew that
But you already knew that
You-you probably already knew that girl
But you already knew that
Oh you already knew that
Yeah you already knew that girl
