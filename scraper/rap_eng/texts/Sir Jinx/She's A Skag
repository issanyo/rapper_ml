[Verse 1: Ice Cube]
Well I was at this party, feeling kind of horny
So I went to the bar, ordered Coke and Bacardi, yes
I was chillin' like an ordinary dude
Smellin' real good, could see the attitude
And then I saw a freak that I think I'd admire
I strolled on over, and sat down beside her
I said "I'm Ice Cube, from the Stereo Crew"
She looked at her friend, then they both said "Who?"
Ice Cube, to rock the joint
Conceded MC, but that's beside the point
And don't turn your back baby, just give me a chance
I only walked over to you to ask for a dance
To dance yes baby, it's you I select
To get you on the floor is the main object
But you a stuck up flict, I tried to hit
Comin' in dead last at a beauty pageant

[Chorus]
She's a Skag
She's a Skag
She's a Skag
She's a Skag

[Verse 2: Sir Jinx]
Well at Venice Beach is where my episode began
To catch a freak was the original plan
Well I was looking good, as you can all see
But this girl I tried to get just didn't agree
So I walked over to her like a fish to a lure
I said I'm Kid Novaco from the Stereo Crew
She said "Listen up, no need to keep talkin'
You don't drive a Benz, so you best keep walkin'"
I said that's not my style, don't carry no beeper
Don't drive a Benz, 'cause the bus is cheaper
If you don't like my ways and you don't like this
Check it out baby, you know what you can kiss
I don't want you, your body ain't that great
26" in the chest when you should be 38"
'Cause you look like a monkey, a jack-ass junkie
Your thighs too fat, and your hips too chunky

[Chorus]
She's a Skag
She's a Skag

[Verse 3: Sir Jinx & Ice Cube]
She's a Skag (Scallywag) when she really needs a bag
Walk around town lookin' like a sea hag
But I talked to her, I must've been mad
But every other girl look just as bad

[Chorus]
She's a Skag
She's a Skag

[Verse 4: Sir Jinx]
Everybody out there, there's a type of girl (A Skag)
That's right, she'll run your world
She'll pick you up and she'll be your honey
But all she really wants is your car and money
She thinks she's fresh, and she tries to impress
With her Georgio perfume and the way she dress
But don't be fooled by the girl's attraction
You tell her that you broke her watch, her reaction
Excuses come quick, she try to be slick
And she can't go out tonight because she thinks she's sick
(She's a Skag) The one that you've been lovin'
(A Skag) The girl is all about numbers
(She's a Skag) You say she's one of a kind
(A Skag) But the girl is robbin' you blind
So hey, if the girl don't give no play
Fellas out there, here's what you say

[Chorus]
She's a Skag
She's a Skag
She's a Skag
She's a Skag

[Verse 5: Sir Jinx & Ice Cube]
Fellas out there you better beware
Skags are lurkin' everywhere
They're every topic, as quick as a rocket
But most of the time you find them in your pocket
When you're poor and broke, they won't talk to ya
When your income is sufficient, they wish they knew ya
You can spot her from a mile, they're always on the prowl
Runnin' that drag with a Kool-Aid smile
And if you haven't heard the latest, her drag is the greatest
Out of all the crooked people, she try to be the straightest
But there's one mistake, you can not make
Don't forget the smile on her face is fake
So leave it alone, we advise
We hope you all out there realize
If a girl's like this, don't boast, don't brag
'Cause you've got a girl that we call a Skag

[Chorus]
She's a Skag
She's a Skag

[Refrain]
She's a skag (Scallywag) when she really needs a bag
Walk around town lookin' like a sea hag
But we talked to her, we must've been mad
But every other girl look just as bad

[Chorus]
She's a Skag
She's a Skag
She's a Skag
She's a Skag

[Refrain]
She's a skag (Scallywag) when she really needs a bag
Walk around town lookin' like a sea hag
But we talked to her, we must've been mad
But every other girl look just as bad

[Chorus]
She's a Skag
She's a Skag
She's a Skag
She's a Skag

[Outro]
