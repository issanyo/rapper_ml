[Blends into intro with dialogue from Spike Lee's Do the Right Thing]

"Twenty D Energizers."
"Twenty C Energizer?"
"D, not C, D."
"C Energizer?"
"D, motherfucker, D! Learn to speak English first, alright? D!"
"How many you say?"
"Twenty, motherfucker, twenty."
"Honey..."
"Mother fuck you!"

[Ice Cube]
Every time I wanna go get a fuckin' brew
I gotta go down to the store with the two
Oriental one penny countin' motherfuckers
That make a nigga mad enough to cause a little ruckus
Thinkin' every brother in the world's out to take
So they watch every damn move that I make
They hope I don't pull out a gat and try to rob
They funky little store, but, bitch, I got a job
"Look, you little Chinese motherfucker
I ain't tryin' to steal none of yo' shit, leave me alone!"
"Mother fuck you!"
Yo, yo, check it out
So don't follow me up and down your market
Or your little chop suey ass'll be a target
Of the nationwide boycott
Juice with the people, that's what the boy got
So pay respect to the black fist
Or we'll burn your store right down to a crisp
And then we'll see ya
Cause you can't turn the ghetto into black Korea

"Mother fuck you!"
