Baby, I saw you from afar
And you wanted my attention
Baby, I'm not afraid to mention, no
Ya' sent the signals one by one
Oh, I just did not respond
Suga, ya know I got it goin' on

I remember when your love was so good
Whisperin' sweet things in my ear
Tellin' me all the things I wanna hear
But now you're gone and all is said and done
You used to be my number
I'm gonna find another one

You tried to play me out
Didn't know what true love was all about

The hardest thing for me to do
Was tell you I was through with you, yeah
