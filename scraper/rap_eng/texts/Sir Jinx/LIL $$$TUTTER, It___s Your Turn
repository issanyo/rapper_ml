Little Stutter you better stop muttering
Or else I'll tell your mother and then you’ll start shudderin
Last week, you were suspended
And if she heard that shit you would want to end it
White boi use the “N” word
Attention seeking, you just wanna be heard

And you better not grab my ass
I’m like Abby, yes ill take a pass

Past you and your janky homies
What they gonna do? Try to bone me
Yeah, Mack and little sailor
Your complexion starting to get paler

Blood flushed right out
Just along with your clout


You think you cool with your expensive t-shirts
Air Max boots, hiding a small weiner

But yeah come on Seth what’s new?
Probably nothing, maybe a new shrew

I doubt you even know this track
That’s why it’s such a good clap back

Sometimes I feel kinda bad
You stutter- that means your childhood really sad

But at the same time you is just a little bitch
Your lines are whack, your tune is out of pitch
You talk about heroin?
All you do is vape, you’ll never get head again
Maybe you never did in the first place
I bet you never made it past first base

We ain’t talking baseball
You nut right at the start like Darth Maul

You and me, we go a long way back
The trouble is you always been a jack
Ass, has always been your vice
But girls know youve never been nice

Nor do you follow the rules
You constantly be acting a fool

We know you smoke weed on the weekends
Always coughing, up until the joint end
You make me need a juice cleanse



Okay Seth, here comes another verse
Don’t get scared, but you may need a hearse

Shaved sides, alt right hair cut
But forreal I’m gonna be blunt

It’s amazing that you’re still here
Yes even after all these years

Last week we thought you were gone for good
To some alternative school in the hood

Well, you’re never gonna learn
Little Stutter, it’s your turn
