[Intro]
"Get down let's see your hands, see your hands!
Let's see your hands, everybody, hands!
Everybody let's see some hands! Huh?
Don't nobody move!
Don't get out of the car, stay where you're at"

[Verse 1]
Niggas in the street that I dislike
You better get this right
These days what the fuck is a fist fight
Picture me puttin niggas in headlocks
When I can lick off shots, and put they ass in a box
Cause if you steppin to me tryin to throw a right hook
You're just lookin to get your motherfuckin life took
Cause I can't wait to be a niggas fate
So while you lift weights, I'm liftin light ass nickel plates
So if you wanna misbehave nigga
I'll have to kick it to the motherfuckin grave digger
You motherfucker you heard it
Doin all that rope-a-dope shit, nope, your dopey-ass murdered
Niggas'll be the Karate Kid
But I'll be in prison doin a motherfuckin body-bid
So you can take all that Rocky shit home
Sylvester Stallone ain't shit against Al Capone
Cause I ain't got no patience or energy
For motherfuckers and punk-ass suckers that wanna injure me
Step up and play me like I'm soft
Bitch I don't knock motherfuckers out, I'm knockin motherfuckers off
Leavin the scene like Machine Gun Kelly
Two to the head about four across the belly
Steady givin niggas the runs
Fuckin clowns put your fists down and go for your guns

[Interlude]
"Alright, on the ground, face down face down on the ground
Get on the ground
Hands behind your head"

"So, so what are you gonna do?
Beat-beat the crap out of me?" GO!

[Verse 2]
You punk-ass niggas better hop or chill
Cause my Glock can kill twenty motherfuckers with boxer skills
That's how I put a niggas head out
The murder scene needs more than Visine to get the red out
And I don't give a fuck if you know Judo
Cause I'mma blow your motherfuckin ass to Pluto
And when I blast the trey niggas pass away
Put in the ground til your silly clown ass decay
So all you niggas with the jokes
(Is everybody ready?) Well dibbida-dat's all folks.
Cause nigga you don't want the nine to go (boom)
Niggas like Tyson woulda died a long time ago
Ran outta luck when I struck on you sucker ducks
No uppercuts you'll be another motherfucker bucked
Gettin all rough in scuffed up boots
Hell no, I'm givin motherfuckers burial suits
Your little T.K.O was A.O.K
My way is R.I.P., niggas are D.O.A
Dead on Arrival
So nigga you better come with your gun if you want survival
From the Mac-11
And those are real shots on the motherfuckin track 7
I ain't kickin niggas buns
If it's a bitch I'mma wetta you better go for your guns

[Interlude]
"Yo wassup, what the fuck is up now man?
What?
Where my money at man?
Hey yo, yo I told you I'd see you when I see you
Aww man you act like you wanna fight
What what? Yeah yeah alright yeah, I wanna fight" *BOOM*

[Verse 3]
Rollin up on niggas wearin wigs
Cause I got a Sig for you nigs and all you motherfuckin pigs
Kool G Rap's a bad decision
Fuck front page I'm puttin niggas on television
I got heart kid if you want we can throw it out
But you ain't got no heart motherfucker when I blow it out
Straight out your back
Cause you got attacked by the mack let's see you black belt dat
Picture me doin some pushups, and get ambushed up
And put in a box all squooshed up
So motherfucker be a learner
Cause I can't hit or wrestle a niggas without pullin out my burner
So when a motherfucker want to fight
You fuck around with G and you'll be fightin death tonight
So you don't wanna get loose chief
Cause I'm givin more flat lines to niggas than loose-leaf
So come on Bruce Lee
Yo I'mma show you who the motherfucker is with all the juice G
So if you wanna intimidate
A nigga like me, great, will make your fuckin head disintegrate
I'm sendin niggas to Bedrock
Look out for the red dot
Or get your motherfuckin head shot
Niggas are dialin 911
Huh, you little bitch niggas go for your guns
