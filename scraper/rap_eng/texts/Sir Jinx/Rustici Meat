[Verse]
Goddamn, I can't stand to look at you
But, now it's time I took from you
Wanna diss me, well here's one for you
Salad Fingers called, he wants his fingers back you damn ginger
Lookin' like Slender Man, but more like a transgender man
And I keep on poppin', but ALL you do is keep on stoppin'
Reppin' these J's, but you really be lookin' for those gays
Tall man thinks he's coolin', but he really be foolin'
Asking me if I beat my meat, but I really be cookin' up some Rustici meat
Getting crossed up by sixth graders
Yo James, stick to that Rapoza dick
Thinking about Travis Scott's dick
But Lucas really thinks you're a prick
