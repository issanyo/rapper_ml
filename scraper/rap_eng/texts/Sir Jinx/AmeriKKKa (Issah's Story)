[Verse 1: Dru Wills]
Issah, 23, fresh outta college
Real nigga attitude but killing you with knowledge
Can't nobody stop me on this path that I started
Shit, I left the gangbangers back in my old projects
Perry Ellis slacks, tie, with the shoes to match
Everybody gives me stares just bc my skin is black
I'm tired of this hick ass town
Giving niggas looks just because our skin is brown
It's all good, got my momma out the hood
She don't live in Riverdale, made sure she's doing good
So tell me, why I get stares in Newnan town?
Even though I walked the stage in my fucking cap and gown
Racism still alive. That don't sound fair
Martin's dream turned into Martin's nightmare
Riding in my Acura on Prince road
Though my white coworkers thought I drove a 64
I don't wanna be the next Michael Brown
The next Sean Bell could be from your town
Not trying to skip chapters in this story
But it starts with a fuck ass cop named Corey
Had me face down on the ground
Left hand on the radio, the other on the tre' pound
Just for jay walkin
Arm on my neck, bull shit he's talking
Look boy, I don't think you fucking understand
Keep resisting you're gonna be the next Sandra Bland
Now tell me what yall think
Wasn't resisting, just wanted to go grab a drink
Cause shit, work was rough
But now I got this fuck ass cop talkin tough
Just trynna be successful, get my riches bigger
But I'm down on the ground cause im a nigga

[Break]

[Verse 2:]
Sitting on the curb feeling stupid
Though, this fuck cop should be the one feeling foolish
And he knew this, But I didn't run
Thinking he the shit with a badge and a gun
Are we livin in the 60s?
Asked him if hes fucking Kermit cause he looks like Miss Piggy
Maybe I should shut the fuck up
Not trying to be another black man roughed up
By a crooked ass cop
I'm surprised he didn't pull his Glock and started thumpin shots
But something crazy happened
Old white man walked up to this faggot
Told the cop you abusing your power
This man didn't do shit wrong you fucking coward
Fuck cop stared at him
Then he let me up as if nothing happened
As I stood up off the pavement
He said stay outta trouble or I'm taking you to the station
Everybody here ain't racist, or unorthodox
Even white man dont fuck with crooked cops
