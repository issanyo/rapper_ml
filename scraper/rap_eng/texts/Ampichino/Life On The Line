[Intro: The Jacka]
Its the Mob man
Devil... American Horror
Story.. Jack
Shiieeet
I know they know what this
You gotta know

[Verse 1: The Jacka]
I used to wanna join a label, start a stable, be just like my hero
Now we got the empty all we talk about is killing people
Our memories erased when California hit us with the legal
Feelin' like I'm young, (?), under the coat four-nickel
I don't give a shit think I'm a bitch we (?) to correct you
My niggas want you down I walk you out don't mean I don't respect you
You heard of me before
Mob because nobody wanna lead the world
They locked up Kazi he was prolly finna lead the world
I'm getting famous but my thing was just to paint a euro
Now I'm just insane catch a drain lookin' in the mirror
You gonna get dope but come closer you can hear us clearer
