[Intro]

[Verse 1: Ampichino]
American Horror story
Bodies get tortured, it is murder for territory
Killing niggas off with a rifle (?)
This is off the wire, my niggas are psycho like Michael Myers
Blasting, nigga the pain is (?)
Ready to smash in, I'm deadly like James Cagney
Body bags (?)
Put it in the back of a Maseratti and gasing it
Don't ask me Nathaniel, blowed out with the collapsible HK with the pearl handle
The House of the Dead, 36 zips this shit is over your head
I'm standing over your bed with a Jason mask on
I'm ready to murdering, (?) your bones
Blood plasma, fragments on your dome
The bullet travel from the tip of the pistol and then your dome

[Hook: Chino Nino]
American Horror Story
Amityville, sick like Norman Bates
See ya mammy get killed
Pull up in the hearse, (?)
Children of the corn (?)


[Verse 2: The Jacka]
Why act hard you know we packing
Pulling up with niggas with triggers and slow reactions
I'm with the evil genius hyenas that's not laughing
Already in your crib when you enter so all our masks off
Nigga I just spent a hundred grand cause we trafficking
Pull my cannon have you outside with no pants like a African
Same time out here with them cans gun you down in the late night
I'll have you with no hands like a nigga who can't fight
Smoking old men with a nigga who take life
Before he rat his friend he a man who don't think twice
Or take advice from a square ass mothafucka
He take you light, take his life then everybody love you
Showing love but I know you scared
I feel a lie you not alive if I owe you bread
You owe the Mob its not no way to (?)
Unless I take you to my rival and you come out with his fucking head

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Dubb 20]
Baggin up good in my cabin in the woods
Ghetto grim reaper with my cannon in my hood


[Hook]
