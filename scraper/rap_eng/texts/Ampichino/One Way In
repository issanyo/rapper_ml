[Intro: Rydah J. Klyde]
I had to do it, it was
No other choice, took off my mask
Because he noticed my voice, A little nigga but a strap (?)
I kidnap, jack and trap I never been employed

[Verse 1: The Jacka]
They used to beat you up every nigga knew the king of the school
Now you quickly see the king or queen when you whip out a tool
Sick but the one with the chicken who they listening to
Trigg locked, King Freak died, we don't listen no more
Simple drum on the nickel make you piss on yourself
Babylon get on us they gon' take me to jail
So we don't pull over free all my niggas down
One way in my hood and no way out
Lash another thug they showed they wealth
See the llama dripping off the 'Gamo belt
They say they got drugs so we line them up
I said I be back in no time now they can't find us

[Hook: Rydah J. Klyde]
'Cause it was one way in and no way out
Where hustlers get hustled, the players play out
We be a illogic with a killer when the k's came out, the brains hang out, you might change your route
A hundred from the get go (a hundred from the get go)
A hundred from the get go (a hundred from the get go)
I did a hundred from the get go (a hundred from the get go)
I just wanna get dough

[Verse 2: Rydah J. Klyde]
Live low, showboatin' on when you did more
But you don't keep score (did a hundred from the get go)
With more knowledge than college scholars, that's more than dollars, damned if I do

[Hook]


[Verse 3: Ampichino]
Never had a job, rob and steal with my niggas
Born in the mob hopin' god will forgive us


[Hook]


[Verse 4: Planet Asia]
Iced out mob material, all hail the grinders
PA from central Vall, that's god science
Bunch of tour sluts pulling up in that Porsche truck
All of them slaves to the waves under my Horse Brush
(?) where the pimpin is natural
Did to much dirt to every get a tattoo
Kushed out I'm higher than the presi price
In the lab with Diggs scarfing a vegi slice

[Hook]
