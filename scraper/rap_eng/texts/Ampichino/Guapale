[HD of Bearfaced & Ampichino]
⁽ᴴᴰ⁾ Used to try to reach out, had to watch my hands
Feed them niggas with the long thang, long hand

⁽ᴬᵐᵖ⋅⁾ When that strong came through we called it Conan
The Barbarian spit bars that'll bury 'em

⁽ᴴᴰ⁾ And we expose these cats like veterinarian
They not used to the beef, they vegetarian

⁽ᴬᵐᵖ⋅⁾ They better cut that shit out like a cesarean
C-Section, ⁽ᴴᴰ⁾go hard like erection
We all got boners on each weapon

⁽ᴬᵐᵖ⋅⁾ The detectives trynna figure out who the necklace

⁽ᴴᴰ⁾ Taxin' niggas on the lean call it Lil' Texas
In the kitchen whippin' whole things up for breakfast
Let them fly out the spaceship like The Jetsons

⁽ᴬᵐᵖ⋅⁾ I can't wait to see my grandmother in the essence
Finessin' these niggas yankin' on Smith & Wessons
Quit traffickin' end up dead in a split second
Catch you in the intersection ⁽ᴴᴰ⁾shots intercepted
⁽ᴬᵐᵖ⋅⁾in his midsection, ⁽ᴴᴰ⁾metal jackets tear vests
(?) plays like Vick, we breed killers in piss
Where I come from, ⁽ᴬᵐᵖ⋅⁾Even gorillas get lit
The hardest in your click get hit first

⁽ᴴᴰ⁾ Before I run up in a bitch, I run up in her purse
Hood rich off the syrup and Oxys
I done seen niggas get it up and fuck off the profit
Got a crazy work ethic and he spit ill logic
To get a vacuum seal you gotta put in deposit

⁽ᴬᵐᵖ⋅⁾ Killers in the project, only bones in my closet
It's from dead men they tryin' to run him out through the (?)
30 round cartridge in the abandoned apartments

⁽ᴴᴰ⁾ Suckas might know what we whippin' so watch how you park it (Get a motorcycle)
Ratchet in my Ferragamo take away your tomorrow
Brought it back with vanilla and a special pineapple

⁽ᴬᵐᵖ⋅⁾ Fish Scale, trynna get this money to stack up
30 round houses on the Mack truck how could you snack up
Spectacular over a stove look like a spatula
Dracula, kill you for dough dead in this Acura

⁽ᴴᴰ⁾ Immaculate baby you swallowin' my ejaculate
Elaborate on anything that gotta do with presidents
For Harlem & Haleyah I'll bareface the city bank
Open up the bag the Molly sparkle up like candy paint
Watch a broke nigga face when you mention the (?)

⁽ᴬᵐᵖ⋅⁾ Don't mention this (?) heron in the fish tank
Balloons for goons in the penn. trynna get weight
Cut him on the tear stick a shank in the snitch face

⁽ᴴᴰ⁾ Young soul snatcher got a hundred his first case
So easy for a young nigga to throw his life away
Even though it's evil nothin' sweeter than guapale
Lash team kick the door ram in and pop the safe
Trynna stack (?) this how we operate

⁽ᴬᵐᵖ⋅⁾ Cooking crack-ola I never put my Glock away
A.M.P.I i'm dope like Dr. Jay
Hop out a drop put a chop in the copper's face
Rob base you could cook it and sell it
Load it on a spoon, shoot it up, or inhale it
I smell jealousy niggas irrelevant
They can't fuck with me they celibate get your melon split
I just signed a 360 but it's a dope deal
When I shop I pick my blow out of coke fields
Whoever cop heavy know i'm gettin' a dope deal
In the kitchen grittin' my O's look like oatmeal
