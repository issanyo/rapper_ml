[Intro]
Lift your chin, set your shoulders
Plant your feet, take a brace
When it's vain to try to dodge it
Do the best you can do
You may fail, but you may conquer
See it through
Black may be the clouds about you
And your future may seem grim
But don't let your nerve desert you
Keep yourself in fighting trim
If the worst is bound to happen
Spite of all that you can do
Running from it will not save you
See it through
Even hope may seem but futile
When with troubles you're beset
But remember you are facing
Just what other men have met
Eyes front, head high to the finish
See it through

[Hook]
I set up a plan and then I seen it through
I gave you a chance 'cause I believed in you
No matter how hard it get, see it through
My only award was just to see you grow
So see it through, see it through
No matter how hard it get, see it through
See it through, See it through (Damn...Jack)
No matter how hard it get

[Verse 1: The Jacka]
Moms gone
Pops, his arm in a belt
Me in juvenile hall, wonderin' why we hate ourselves
Drugs brought us all down, is it too late to save myself
Grandma stressed, kicked outta school, I can't behave myself
Whole time tryna' be cool, I made the bed I slept
Wonder is my little ones cool 'cause now I never check
Not right, I owe you my life, so now I do my best
Ill whip, come through the night, though I'm a piece of shit
Pray God till we get right then how soon we forget
Here I am, thousands of rap fans lovin' The Jack
Coke drain got me insane and I don't love 'em back
These gems stem from real pain, they don't deserve this shit
Dopest rap song in the game, you never heard of it
Should be the judge and the witness because I murdered it
In the past, thought for my listeners, so I killed him with class
Young lads wanna be rappers, so I give em' a chance

[Hook: The Jacka]
I set up a plan and then I seen it through
I gave you a chance 'cause I believed in you
No matter how hard it get, see it through
My only award was just to see you grow
So see it through, see it through
No matter how hard it get, see it through
See it through, See it through
No matter how hard it get

[Verse 2: Kae-1]
Shit I really do can't tell you in a song
Can't incriminate myself who gone write me if I'm gone
Copped an eighth we gone pour it until it's gone
And a nigga so hood how did he get so on
Write my wrongs I'm trying to do the right thing
I gotta stay on my grind 'cause I'm a boss a young king
Bussin 4 20s out the judge
Bust that girl down can't lie I get a buzz
Appeared in that thing in the wrapper
Want a real nigga not the ordinary rapper
36s way to chop her
It took me 30 seconds how quick did I knock her
Young niggas making money like doctors
Over the stove whippin like it's off of the rocker
Game done made my heart cold as hell
Commissary and some mail to my niggas up in jail forreal

[Hook: The Jacka]
I set up a plan and then I seen it through
I gave you a chance 'cause I believed in you
No matter how hard it get, see it through
My only award was just to see you grow
So see it through, see it through
No matter how hard it get, see it through
See it through, See it through
No matter how hard it get

[Verse 3: Ampichino]
We pumpin' snow 'cause I believe in you
He got the go just make sure you see it through
I'm in the kitchen trying to see what a key will do
It's hard for good to picture this money we was breezin through
I hop out the bed holding the tech
Everyday I wake up I feel closer to death
Every time I go to cop I'm holding my breathe
I know anyday they can knock me there's a war in the jects
25 to life for the coke and the x
My lawyer talking crazy my mom hope for the best
She already lost her left breast to cancer
Sitting on the church steps asking god for answers
Stripped from our real names
Trapped in Babylon
Wish I had a magic wand
This planet I travel on
Is cursed since birth
My hood is like the Amazon
Gorillas and orangutans
Do business with hammers on

[Outro]
Ya it's the motherfuckin J-A nigga
PTM and the motherfuckin mob nigga ya know im sayin
It's the dopest shit you ever heard before nigga I ain't gonna lie to you man
It's the illest shit out
Period
What happened to the world, the street album
