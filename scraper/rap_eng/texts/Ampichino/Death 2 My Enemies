[The Jacka]
Just tryin' to protect my nigs, on some mob shit
We'll never let you win, rep the projects now
Everything out here, just not sense
You was never the I swear, we monsters
Stab me in the face you won't make it through the night
30 on his waist but he still lost his life
I was down south down in the deep
Ridin' with a pure round house on my seat
Niggas that I grew up with, been knew I'm nice
You ain't got no kicks, Kimbo Slice

[Hook: Husalah]
In the night time in the moonlight
Gunshots echo the (?)
I hear them whispering, all my enemies
The squares speaking they want to put me all to sleep
That's why I chose this life and here I speak, that's why I chose this
(?) squeeze, Squeeze I squeeze, wishing death pon my enemies

[Ampichino]
We pull up in convertibles to murder you
Eat beef like burgers my niggas ain't never heard of you
Innocent youth, then pulled a Glock on ya
Gangster and a gentlemen move coke at the opera
You think that's what's poppin' because it's popular
Use chops to rock him, baby I'm in the mafia
Shock him with a tec, take a ride through the 'jects
Devilz Rejectz, I'll die for respect
You can be next, cuz we was poverty stricken
That's why my trap do numbers, like lottery tickets
Summer after summer, it's hot in the kitchen
I try to tell my little niggas, but they not finna listen
Fuck it, grab the duffle, dropped him a chicken
Watch him break it down in zips straight to the block and then pitch it
No shoppin' and kickin' it, no boppin' with bitches
Got hop, off top, I gave the block the bidness

[Hook:]

[Lil Rue]
Now when them vans pull up and them niggas start runnin'
Shells start droppin' and you niggas start duckin'
Bullets hit ya body and heart stop pumpin'
I ride with all gangsters, sippin' on my tussin'
You niggas say they all gangsta, but they really all bluffin'
I got niggas younger than me that'll knock you off for nothin'
I ride and slide in lowkey, steady sucka duckin'
Young fly nigga got the little chicken cluckin'
It's fucked up goin' against a nigga with nothin' to lose
But you niggas actin' tough like you got somethin' to prove
Shoe lace around my neck yeah I'm stuntin' the Uz
I play the game how it goes, I just follow the rules
I was 13 with 22s in my, shoe, the only nigga rockin' a pistol in middle school
In the night, I be high as 3 [?] I ain't gotta talk I'll let the choppa speak for me

[Hook:]
