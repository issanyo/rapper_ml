[Verse 1: The Jacka]
Hunnid pack of Raws, 60 Styrofoams, 'Bron Sprite, Cream Jones when the pack touch down
Nickel in the tuck, who can you really trust when the numbers go up like a touchdown
All I think about is us, choose paper over lust, waiting for the UPS truck touch down
I just wanna live in a dope place, summer in the cuts where our dope safe
Slow money better than no cake, still I'm 24 nigga no break
The people that I lost made my soul ache
Its all I talk about so they don't hate
Just give your all if you so great
So much bar we are overwieght
All my life I held a strap before I could hold it straight
They love me if they thugging real nigga from the golden gate
Pistol in my 'ligions smoking shit that's from the golden state
Listen...

[Hook: The Jacka] (x2)
We hope the check last long
Niggas locked where did we go wrong
Never wait for a drop at the doorstep
Stacked the bread we got so when laws come we cool with it


[Verse 2: Ampichino]
Can't wait to see my nigs in the afterlife
I thought that my life was gon' change when I grabbed the mic
I'm not Webbie but I'm living a savage life
You niggas acting like killers, and never had a fight
Never sold white, (?) but the age
Never took a flight with a banger on cold night
Never rolled dice, or put it all on the line
I let my balls hang, I do this shit all the time
My middle name is crime, I think I'm out my mind
It's hard to spit rhymes and  push coke at the same time
I go hard when it's game time, military mind, kill a nigga with the same nine, I thought I had a future, but the world blind, you thought I was gon' shoot you, but your girl mine
I hit you where it hurts, in your bitches purse
We just became spitters, we was gritters first

[Hook] (x2)
We hope the check last long
Niggas locked where did we go wrong
Never wait for a drop at the doorstep
Stacked the bread we got so when laws come we cool with it
We hope the check last long
Niggas locked where did we go wrong
Never wait for a drop at the doorstep
Stacked the bread we got so when laws come we cool with it
