[The Jacka]
Nod your head to the kongos
They turnin' all the 'jects into condos
It sound like some serious shit my friend
Look around everywhere it ain't the same
Sideshows shut down no where to hang
Everybody moved away and times changed
911 made the price on the pies raise
They still gettin' high anyways
So I'm really fly sittin' up blowin' trees
Always buy nigga never front shit to me
Ask around I ain't frontin' 'bout my history
I been around since Rydah sung Misery
Runnin' through a key doin' murders in the street
Gotta cop from me if you really wanna eat
It's not a grip, I'm just sayin' boy I got it cheap
Out of state star quarterback goin' deep

[Chorus]
Big blow that's all I know
Kush and Dro that's all I know
Gettin' money from a ho that's all I know
I got a job for the city bitch I'm shovelin' snow
Big blow that's all I know
Kush and Dro that's all I know
Gettin' money from a ho that's all I know
I got a job for the city I got work to go

[Berner]
I fire up and relax
Nice batch you know how that kush smokes
50 dollar hash for my stick so it burn slow
Just another Monday lettin' that work go
Today I'm on Cherry, Bubba, and Purple
I turn my beat up and light my weed up
We get love from the street cuz the streets need us
Hit me when can meet up
About a hundred fifty grand in my stash yeah I'm ready for the re-up
Old school chevy in my driveway, put a truck full of reggie on the highway
Doin' 90 lookin' out for the highway
Damn right I'm livin' proof that crime
I stay clean ain't no cut in my cream
Got a blunt full of kush and a cup full of lean
Gotta move weight had enough of the fiends
20 grand in my jeans I'm the man can't you see? Shit

[Chorus]
Big blow that's all I know
Kush and Dro that's all I know
Gettin' money from a ho that's all I know
I got a job for the city bitch I'm shovelin' snow
Big blow that's all I know
Kush and Dro that's all I know
Gettin' money from a ho that's all I know
I got a job for the city I got work to go

[Ampichino]
Out here in a world so cold, sellin' cocaine is all I know
Tryna think on a higher plane
But I still get high tryna hide the pain, hustle in the rain
This world'll never change
I told my girl I'll never change
When papi touchdown I want everything
Duffle bag cartel cop heavy game
Young niggas with plenty yay
Come up short home boy I'll let the semi spray
You can die any day
He begged for his life I put a hollow in him anyway
From the city where you don't let a dollar pass
Sands of time livin' life in the hour glass
Thanksgiving without the feastin'
Lookin' for a reason to smother him
It's drought season

[Chorus]
Big blow that's all I know
Kush and Dro that's all I know
Gettin' money from a ho that's all I know
I got a job for the city bitch I'm shovelin' snow
Big blow that's all I know
Kush and Dro that's all I know
Gettin' money from a ho that's all I know
I got a job for the city I got work to go
