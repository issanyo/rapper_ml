[Intro: Ampichino]
Desert Eagle 5-0 same color as my hero
Lifetime life of crime its a war against my people
I swear the world blind now they back to moving diesel
Tired of moving coke and I know that it's evil

[Verse 1: Ampichino]
Mom said she loved us, pops never hugged us
By the age 14 I was selling rocks to my uncles
Aunty's cousins in the block hustling
And they say I walk funny I got that chop on my stomach
Don't Nann nigga want it, I was up all night till the top of the morning
Serving fiends hard white its rock and its going
High performance big block
Sideways with that thang yanking off them tee-tops
It sound like I'm trynna start a lawn mower
We overlords of this over(?) and we over war
We go (?) and knock (?)
You know we don't give a fuck we were selling it to em raw
A rebel without a cause, I'm a outlaw
Nigga fuck the feds I be dumping them shots off
Killing and selling dope that's how I get my rocks off
Top shottas, mobstas, and crime bosses

[Hook: Ampichino]
Desert Eagle 5-0 same color as my hero
You might be a thug but to them you're never equal
Lifetime life of crime its a war against my people
Insane out our mind only let the stupid lead you
I swear the world blind now they back to moving diesel
Devilz Rejectz like dope in a needle
Tired of moving coke and I know that it's evil
But it's the only thing I know selling blow to my people

[Verse 2: The Jacka]
Hunnid thang on me will never let me down
Hunnid times on (?) will never let me down
Mob boss you ain't in no condition be fucking off
Cause we tripping have you red over chicken like hot sauce
Look around at the niggas that's with me they not lost
Pour a 9 in a Lebron Sprite we nodding off
Getting high cause just last night they wrapped Boss
Then get back me and Fed bring straps to (?)
I used to wake up in the penn. wearing all black clothes
My (?) speak the European cause of the cars we chose
I barely think about the women and the hearts we stole
Today we large but we came from cooking hard on stoves

[Hook]
Desert Eagle 5-0 same color as my hero
You might be a thug but to them you're never equal
Lifetime life of crime its a war against my people
Insane out of mind only let the stupid lead you
I swear the world blind now they back to moving diesel
Devilz Rejectz like dope in a needle
Tired of moving coke and I know that it's evil
But it's the only thing I know selling blow to my people
