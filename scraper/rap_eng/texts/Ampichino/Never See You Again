[Intro]
I hope I never see you again
Ampichino
I hope I never see you again
The Jacka
And we are

[Verse 1: Ampichino]
In it for the goapele let the choppa spray
I ain't got a lot to say we was balling like Dr. J
I kept somethin' that'll knock you down from a block away
And it barely make a sound I told you we not for play
Spit in the copper's face I play with a lot of cake
And deal with a lot of weight and I deal with a lot of hate
This just the life when you deal with a lot of paper
Counting bands all night in the skyscraper
Tailor made suits we were sliding fly paper
Never let you slide I call Rydah the fly gangster
They track you down through a phone book or the internet
Catch him in the intersection let the Tech intercept him
It's crunch time and we shine like reflectors
All dope I get dough I'm plugged with the necklace
I made fifty bands before breakfast
Devilz Rejectz the dopest no question

[Hook: The Jacka]
You know I thought about it all day
And all the trouble that I get in
I know you wondering where I am
I better never see you again
I gotta load up the troops again
Let the world the truth is near
I used to think that you was my nigg
I hope I never see you again

[Verse 2: The Jacka]
Shoulda never seen you
Believed in ourselves then everything came through
Shot a nigga in my crew but nobody bulletproof
Better hope you're by yourself when I slide up next to you
Cause nobody will be spared 'less a woman or child there
Killed my cousin Tay can't believe they allowed that
Remember hail P-World (?)
Never thought you'd go away now I snort away my fix
So much bull in my face that I drove away my chick
Was with Hus and PK they unloaded on our whip
Now can't nothing save you same day I return the favor
(?) ramadan after that we return to prayer
SalatulIsha brought it up to not mislead you
They hear our songs they love our thoughts but I do not need you
I gotta leave you cause my whole life illegal
We selling primo where I'm bout to light a pre-roll
Can't nothing stop us cause we mobstas like Casino
Mobstas, machine gun, and Bugsy Siegel
(?) like you know me but I never seen you
Devilz Rejectz only thing left for y'all to cling to

[Hook]
You know I thought about it all day
And all the trouble that I get in
I know you wondering where I am
I better never see you again
I gotta load up the troops again
Let the world the truth is near
I used to think that you was my nigg
I hope I never see you again
I hope I never see you again
I hope I never see you again
