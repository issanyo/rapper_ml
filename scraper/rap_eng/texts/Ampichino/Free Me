[Hook X2: Berner]
All white Benz, I'm just ridin' like I'm leanin'
Three or four charges and I'm hoping that I beat 'em
They let just ball out, then they pull us out a dream
Look at me
Twenty-nine, in the cell screaming free me

[Verse 1: Berner]
New Gucci Locs, uh, custom made Gucci coat
Black jeans, fifty stacks, lean got me movin' slow
Bitches in my face talkin' money, is she ready though
I guess she strips and already hoes
Trust me, I lost loved ones over money
It's funny
Cause I know my ex-wife still loves me
Twenty on my head, try and take me away
I'll leave a shooter on his face, dead
You think that I'm playin'
I'm talking nights with no sleep, stuck, thinkin' of jail
My lil homie got hit, shit, I hope he don't tell
I hope all is well, them letters gettin' harder to read
My daughter needs her dad, but daddy's still stuck in them streets
I'll do an old school flip with that mitt if I have too
Roll the windows up and let the pigs right roll past you
It's cloudy in my car, how you livin'?
And if I die tonight, remember me like John Lennon
Fly woman give me gifts just to get some dick
I'm on the road like Joe Pelly if the feds come hit
I only rap cause I need this trap money legit
I'm in the sticks, letting pounds of kush go for six
And my shit's limo tint, sun roof, feel the sun
Mind numb from the shit I seen, I hate doing wrong
Crime pays, why lie, shit, I'm young and I'm rich
Probably sittin' in the cell looking back at this shit

[Hook X2: Berner]
All white Benz, I'm just ridin' like I'm leanin'
Three or four charges and I'm hoping that I beat 'em
They let just ball out, then they pull us out a dream
Look at me
Twenty-nine, in the cell screaming free me

[Verse 2: Freeze]
What the fuck my nigga Price die?
Ain't no love in this streets, so the price high
I cry, dry tears out my eyes, so I'm hot
Wife walked out on our marriage cause I'm a mob guy
She want a regular dude with a regular job
But Freeze married to the game, it's not a facade
No Bill Cosby, no Phylicia Rashad
Bumpin' 2Pac's shit, Ambitions of a Rider
Cause I'm a rider for my sun and my daughter
I might off you, forgive me heavinly father
I ain't the best father, I need their approval
I keep them fresh like every day is back to school
Michael Jay Fox, I'm Back to the Future
Tony Montana style, I am actor as future
Good niggas dying, we need accurate shooters
Accident homo niggas too sacred to put their dukes up

[Hook X2: Berner]
All white Benz, I'm just ridin' like I'm leanin'
Three or four charges and I'm hoping that I beat 'em
They let just ball out, then they pull us out a dream
Look at me
Twenty-nine, in the cell screaming free me

[Verse 3: Ampichino]
House with two swimming pools
All wood floors, glass ceiling, panoramic view
Barbecues in the winter
Still grittin', my vision clear even though I wear carty lenses
Party with women that drink Bacardi and lemon
You niggas is tardy, we've been revil Harley engines
All my niggas that's gone, you know it's hard to mention
And the concept like a fresh from a car convincing
Ball 'til I fall, I still thank God for livin'
Don't go to church, though I'm living, this my religion
Cook and work in the kitchen
That's food for thought, my nigga, you do the dishes
Cover your mouth when we talk, you know the feds listenin'
Guns got the sparkin' at this little son Christinin'
Neck and wrist glistinin'
You owe bread, then found dead by old white fence and then
Hated like Zimmerman, looked at the world we livin' in
Handle your business, we move more trees to Timberland
Ball like the Wimbledon, Harin, Bone, and Pendalin
Project tennamix, ya'll niggas indigent
Ya'll talk that we livin' it, we walked and we did this shit
We're barkin with bigger clips
Don't care if you innocent
Look at my black skin they me the immigrant
He didn't die, I'mma hit him with an iller clip
