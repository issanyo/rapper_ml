[Hook: Ampichino]
King Pin, get caught up take it on the chin
Everything we lost we'll make it back again

[Verse 1: The Jacka]
Got my passport same day went overseas
Sittin' first class thinking damn this was in my dreams
I guess I'm here at last my nigga Ken went to the league
(?) went to the league
Been here from the start thank god for everything
I knew I'd be a star PK in the NYC Jordan passed the ball
Goddamn you the man bull that's something to celebrate
Not normal shit when good times hard to calculate
Remember Haight Street, Cell dropped the CBC
Me n Boe Strangles pulled up late they waited for me
Shit was so packed goddam the memories
And let my Pops out came out to visit me
Never forget that day old enough to buy him weed
He met the Figz we the niggs he was proud to see
His lil' boy is a man now
I had a couple hundred grand he didn't ask me for no hand-out
