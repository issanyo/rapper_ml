[The Jacka]
I guess I revived the scene, they finally realize who’s king
I remind them so much of who they supposed to be, the best time I ever had in my life was free
Grabbed the mic on the stage ripped the crowd, errybody was amazed then look at me now
Even though I’m older I still helped my little niggas spout
Prayed for a change in the hood but (it was all a dream)

[Ampichino]
I used to spray AR[?] magazines on the block where its hot serving crack to fiends
Looking at high beams, running from sireans, the mob ain’t no team we’re a fucking machine
Regime, Treal Shottaz, Devilz Rejectz, all through traffic with a mac in da p-jects
Fuck da boy, we did it off the muscle, fake thugs I’m Ray Luv “Forever Hustlin’”
We came from nuttin to sumthin, I gave my niggas the script to keep bumpin
Let the Feds get on your dick, they keep dumpin
Think you’re slick, try’n to get nigga rich like Mr. Drummond
You can get what you want no problem-o, drive up and get served right through your car window
You can cop like Carl Winslow, come up short and you’re gonna get popped with a four nickel

[Chorus: The Jacka] x2
Wake me up if I’m dreaming
I’m about to go crazy
Look at what the world made me
Where’s the dreams I keep chasing[?]

[The Jacka]
Yeah, It was all a dream
Cooking crack knocked[?] it off I’m a fiend
Dope drived from the lean, ghost ride in my beam
Bounce in gank up outside of a thing
She said “I go, I know I’m on but thanks anyways”
“Matter of fact, where you stay? I got plans for you.”
You a do everything that I tell you to
Let’s get rich fuck everything you’ve been though
I’m in the hood all the time, tryna leave here too
You’re about to lose your mind trying to be here though
Big dreams make it so you really need me ho
Remember me your whole life because I’m ice cream cold
Got a real expensive taste for the price you’ll love
On the block overnight, my top is out of sight
Hiding from the Task and them cars that is all white
Hus had the slaps sitting up he was tight
Had the time of my life when he was home, that’s life

[Chorus] x2

[Zumbi]
Yeah, it was all a dream
Sitting in the south, head spinning
Trying to earn me a living, see a fool straight winning
But ah, I guess it’s all written for the good
Struggling watching homies drown in the hood
We young and restless, the law’s gonna test us
You can’t cop a Lexus on minimum wage
And you can’t find a job but we gotta get paid
Some will run like a slave, I’m a spit a grenade
That will split all the drama, devils are made
And I’ll chant how we rhyme but it wouldn’t get played
So I stayed in the shade, my dreams kept me warm
I perform like a storm for the shit that we on
And that we in the business, you can bear witness
Don’t have to grind D, getting G is my gift is
So I lift this shackle and chain
There been a weight on my brain with no cocaine
But see, we moving up getting over the pain
It’s like an everyday thang, we be one in the same
From the pimps and the pusher to the preachers and hookers
Like Melle Mel pushed us over the edge
Pour a little bit of liquor out over the dead
Reminisce on my folk who went out before me and bled
Keep the dreamin’ alive is how we survive
I thank God that my nine to five is to get live
