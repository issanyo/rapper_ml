[Intro: ]


[Verse 1: The Jacka]
We never planned or ever ran from nothing
My niggas working tan the working mans a sucka
I'm first class on United to Russia
Fresh from Copenhagen bitches beg me to touch em
I'm from the Mob I only talk to bitches bringing me money
I was in Prague they listen to me got the whole UK love me
I'm not a Laker but I staple your center I was in London
With my Ahks making Rakats but they Kater from Yemen
I probably tell you what you thinkin' fore you finish a sentence
A nigga (?) it'll kill he ain't finish his business
Everybody bout to die unless they finishing with us
Shout to everybody fly from the (?)
Slit your throat 'fore you lie that's the code that we living
They paved the road for I & I so its hope for the killers, Mob
Don't fall in love, you on the rise, it ain't no hope for your feeling
Mob
