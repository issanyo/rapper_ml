[Intro: Ampichino]
Cheah
Devilz Rejectz
C-cheah
J-A and The A-M-P-I
Cheah

[Verse 1: Ampichino]
You believe in this
If you ever hit the stand just plead the fifth
Better know who you cop and eatin' with
Had to knock a nigga down you piece of shit
As I look back can't believe I'm rich
Every bar that I spit is the deepest shit
I told my bitch that I sell dope just to keep it lit
Cheah


[Verse 2: The Jacka]
They call me Jack, could never get a job so we all we got
Had us down but they know we strapped
Bitches hit my phone won't get on like they trynna vamp
Nigga watch your tone 'fore a cabron come melt your ass
Fed the next Pac head-shot he was built to last
This can't wait to drop, rap was hot now everybody trash
(?) and a hockey mask

[Verse 2: Ampichino]
I'm hard you know
Selling blow and counting chicken is all we know
Yo, no convo if we ain't talkin' numbers
I can change the weather, make it snow in the summer
When it's raining, chopper bullets, I can make it thunder
Put you in a slumber, my heart cold like tundra
The hood took me under, no bloops or blunders
Fuck your baby's mom, I got rich off cookie monster


[Verse 3: The Jacka]
Check the body count
When I squeeze my Heckler another body fount
Yea, make everybody bounce
But if I squeeze my choppa then there's no way out
They call me Jack, out here getting rich now they want me back
Damn, I knew they was gon' do that
Act proud when they really shot down every move we had

[Verse 4: Ampichino]
Try to live out your dreams
But you still died
Couldn't cry couldn't scream
This is real life, look in the eyes of a king
When he passed away, his pops was in the bing
Never felt a thing
A falcon without a wing
I'm off my deen with a zip and pint of lean
Designer jeans, diamond rings, finer tings, this is different
I came up off Lima Beans

[Outro: The Jacka]
I make a lot of my music for the streets, for the penitentiaries, and at the same time, I make it  for the youth, too, so we can lead them in the right direction, because a lot of people glamorize the life, the style, the streets or whatever like that, you know, but when you hear them speaking, they're not speaking that life. We speak that life, because that's what we come from, you know what I mean? We not joking, we not playing around,  all my friends are either dead or in jail
