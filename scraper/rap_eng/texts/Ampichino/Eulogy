[Verse]
Money my mind frame
Spit dope, lyrically, supply 'caine
Time came, the rich and the famous
Rock five chains, you can say I was brainless
Human tornado, Dolemite stable
You either whip coke or you hold a mic fatal
Designer white labels cause the fiends at night pay you
You got to stay solid in case them suckers try and play you
Put the money on the table, my nigga, let's weigh this paper up
Hand me the duct tape, I'm a bundle this A-1 up
My rhymes dope like a roundhouse
A Peruvian, while you moving back in your mom's house
We was moving units and I ain't talking about music
We was booming pharmaceuticals, get the blow out your cuticles
Business as usual, this a beautiful funeral
Death come in threes, so we make this murder a musical
I got the mind of a Rothschild
Rock galoshes over crocodiles when it's raining out
Bangers flaming, money, sex, and entertainment
The world's most dangerous niggas is who you hanging with
Let me explain it, this how the picture is painted
Precise premonition what got the gifted acquainted
This world's so cold you can feel the pain in my language
I'm exhausted, I feel the pain in my pancreas
This the mania, zaniest, this the fastest
This money ever came in my life, I feel the rapture
I'm hungry, you niggas bologna, Oscar Meyer
I'm off the wire, I'll put a cops head in a dryer
You can smoke all you want, there's none flyer
More game than a crooked attorney, I'll tongue tie you
I'll cook the whole thing up, money can't change us
You can't fuck with me, even if we fuck the same sluts
Angel dust, I'm tangled up, I'll bang your slut
I'll strangle you, leave you pressed up under a mangled bus
Halo's over angels, I hope they pray for us
Cause even the deacons and preachers became afraid of us
Lust ends, fuck friends, family first
Guns burst, I'm starting to question my sanity
Amityville, my mother named me Anthony
Hand me the steel, I'm about to kill my vanity
On my knees, I ask God when I'm gon' die
You could look all you want but ain't no God in the sky
I try to run from this pain by buying jewelry
Fuck it, when I die, let my enemies do my eulogy
I try to run from this pain by buying jewelry
Fuck it, when I die, let my enemies do my eulogy
