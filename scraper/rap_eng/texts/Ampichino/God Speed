[Verse 1: Ampichino]
We are DR, put you the ER
Hit you with the back of the chop
Make you see stars (*rarrrrrr*)
(?)
Counterfeit it, I had a junkie test it, you
Bought a pile of shit, He fell off
Started shooting hop between his toes
(?)


[Hook: The Jacka & Ampichino]
Free my nigga Gap, free Ren Fetti
Your wife on my dick but I rather cop heavy
God speed going light speed never let em catch me
Fuck over The Jack make him wish he never met me
Put my life on the line doing time in the belly
My nigga need a sandwich tell him come to the deli
Where every man wearing two chains get Makaveli'd
And every man selling 'cane to feed his family

[Verse 2: The Jacka]
I'm a Muslim this a Sunnah not a Rozay beard
This a AR-Ab, Dark-Lo, Freeway beard
This Sunni boy (?) beard
This a Ampichin, Suge Knight finna take the plug right
Now the bitch niggas scared to take a risk love life
In the kick game, risk game, no love-life
Taking everything while your lil man does life
Its been a while but I know I'm dope
One way in this low shit no way out
No hanging out you come through here you must be buying coke
Say you want the jets it must be all you smoke
Young king barely read send a knock for everything I want
Barely left the cage went straight back like a conk
No punk gonna play with me way in front
Same day double back on him with the pump
Trigger play is how a nigga pay for what he done

[Hook: The Jacka & Ampichino]
Free my nigga Gap, free Ren Fetti
(?) but I rather cop heavy
God speed going light speed never let em catch me
Fuck over The Jack make him wish he never met me
Put my life on the line doing time in the belly
My nigga need a sandwhich tell him come to the deli
Where every man wearing two chains get makaveli'd
And every man (?) to feed his family

[Verse 3: Lee Majors]
You looking into the eyes of a madman
(?)
Cop heavy free Ren Fetti
(?)
My nigga fresh out the pizza with
One left, he fuck around he might
Lose his whole life, I told him
Slow down he might lose his whole life
Might lose his family and his wife and kid
Fucking over the plug could get your ass clipped
He stressed out stuck his whole face in a brick
Monkey on his back (?)
Hammer on his hip and I ain't talking carpentry
(?)
And I would do the same damn thing, man it's the mob in me


[Hook: The Jacka & Ampichino]
Free my nigga Gap, free Ren Fetti
(?) but I rather cop heavy
God speed going light speed never let em catch me
Fuck over The Jack make him wish he never met me
Put my life on the line doing time in the belly
My nigga need a sandwhich tell him come to the deli
Where every man wearing two chains get makaveli'd
And every man (?) to feed his family
