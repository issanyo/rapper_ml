[The Jacka]
She tried to keep me out of shit but I still ride
He tried, emptied out his clip but ya still died
5 in the morning and I'm still outside
Tryna make a million dollars finna send that broad
On a flight with a brick of white, we so fly
We out our mind we don't sleep at night
The lights are too bright
Took away my sight took away my everything
But I love the life so nigga what set you claim?
A second breath came killin' just to test my aim
Body shot  first time I tested a thang
The best still remain
In the cuts [?]
Keep minding then ya murder's gon' be arranged
It's gon' be a shame
Just give me ya chain, and hop out ya car
Raid his pockets, hop in and blend with the dark
Fuck what you love boy or get shot in the heart

[Chorus]
You see a nigga making these moves
That's why I try
When I fall I'm takin' that bruise
That's why I try
I cannot lose, I cannot lose
That's why I try [x2]

[Ampichino]
Whenever I cook the sherm, believe me it's potent
They say my rhymes are words, just float like the ocean
I keep heat so they call me the toastman
I move coke and weed so they call me a dopeman
I call it hope if ya home was broken
Moms smokin' pops a rollin' stone it's hopeless
I grew up with the rats and the roaches
On a pissy mattress thinkin' bout mansions and Porches
Money expansion [?] your fortress
No door handles only until our money was corporate
[?]
On some 2Pac Shakur shit, makin these whores sick
I go hard I ain't the one to go to war with
Showin' no remorse to ya ribs when this .44 spit
[?] but I still end up doin' time in the pen, shit

[Chorus]
You see a nigga making these moves
That's why I try
When I fall I'm takin' that bruise
That's why I try
I cannot lose, I cannot lose
That's why I try [x2]
