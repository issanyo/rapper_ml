[Chorus]
I don't got no time, what's next (yeah time)
I can't feel my face, mo' stress (yeah stress)
Picking up the pieces, yeah (yeah yeah)
Thought you were the reason, yeah (yeah thought you were)
I don't got no time, what's next (yeah time)
I can't feel my face, mo' stress (yeah stress)
Picking up the pieces, yeah (yeah yeah)
Thought you were the reason, yeah (yeah thought you were)

[Verse]
Take a little trip, I'm on my way (on my way)
You can come along, but you can't stay (no no no no)
Told you everything that I needed (yeah yeah)
All these blue faces, blue cheeses, yeah (oh my god yeah)
Now my pockets painted every way (every way)
And everybody call me by my name (by my name)
Can't hold me back when I'm so far gone
I won't be around when it's all fake love

[Bridge]
I can't go back
It's been so long
Keep bringing back
The same problem
Need more time now
I've been patient
Bit more life now
You've been wasted

[Chorus]
I don't got no time, what's next (yeah time)
I can't feel my face, mo' stress (yeah stress)
Picking up the pieces, yeah (yeah yeah)
Thought you were the reason, yeah (yeah thought you were)
I don't got no time, what's next (yeah time)
I can't feel my face, mo' stress (yeah stress)
Picking up the pieces, yeah (yeah yeah)
Thought you were the reason, yeah (yeah thought you were)
