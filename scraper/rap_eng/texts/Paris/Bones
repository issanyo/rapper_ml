[Verse]
When I'm gone now she want me to stay
I can't leave what you want me to do?
Telling lies got you falling in love
But I lied and I told you the truth
'Cause I'm done with the ways that you move
And I'm tired of feeling so used
Only up in the night I'm alive
Always thinking got something to prove
Now I'm up and I'm feeling alright
Lost it all I got nothing to lose
Should of told you I never would lie
Looking at me I'm looking at you
When I'm gone now she want me to stay
I can't leave what you want me to do?
Telling lies got you falling in love
But I lied and I told you the truth

[Pre-Chorus]
You know I try (try)
Only one way (one way)
You don't go back (go back)
Should've known that (known that)
We got one life (one life)
Only one day (one day)
We can't go back (go back)
Should've known that (known that)

[Chorus]
Each life you take can't break me down
We'll fall away and die alone

[Verse]
When I'm gone now she want me to stay
I can't leave what you want me to do?
Telling lies got you falling in love
But I lied and I told you the truth
'Cause I'm done with the ways that you move
And I'm tired of feeling so used
Only up in the night, I'm alive
Always thinking got something to prove
Now I'm up and I'm feeling alright
Lost it all I got nothing to lose
Should of told you I never would lie
Looking at me I'm looking at you
When I'm gone now she want me to stay
I can't leave what you want me to do?
Telling lies got you falling in love
But I lied and I told you the truth

[Pre-Chorus]
You know I try (try)
Only one way (one way)
You don't go back (go back)
Should've known that (known that)
We got one life (one life)
Only one day (one day)
We can't go back (go back)
Should've known that (known that)

[Chorus]
Each life you take can't break me down
We'll fall away and die alone
