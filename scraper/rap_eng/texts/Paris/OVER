[Pre-Chorus]
Tell me the truth, even when it hurts
I promise you this, I'll give you my word
When I think I'm better, you always make it worse
I promise you this, I'll give you my word

[Chorus]
I'm getting over you, it's over, hard to stay sober when
I'm getting over you, it's over, it's over
I'm getting over you, it's over, hard to stay sober when
I'm getting over you, I'm getting over you

[Verse]
Tell me pretty lies like you love me on the way home
I don't say goodbye, I just hang up the phone
Diamonds in her eyes, but you know that her mind gone
She used to be mine, but now I'm gone

[Bridge]
Break away from us
Swear I gave too much

[Pre-Chorus]
Tell me the truth, even when it hurts
I promise you this, I'll give you my word
When I think I'm better, you always make it worse
I promise you this, I'll give you my word

[Chorus]
I'm getting over you, it's over, hard to stay sober when
I'm getting over you, it's over, it's over
I'm getting over you, it's over, hard to stay sober when
I'm getting over you, I'm getting over you
