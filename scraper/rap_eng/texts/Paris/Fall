[Chorus]
Fall
The way I fell myself
Today I won't break down
I know you call my name
Today I won't break down

[Verse 1]
You've been holding on
I think I can't get enough
Lookin' in my eyes
Tell me that your so in love
I need more than life
It's been far too long
Only got one life
Hope I live it long

For this life I live
Hope I never change
Look me in my eyes
You can feel my pain
I've been gone for so long so long
Bury me inside of your coffin

I've been waiting over so long
You've been calling all night so gone
I can't wait I know you’re all wrong
Telling me to stay

[Chorus]
Fall
The way I fell myself
Today I won't break down
I know you call my name
Today I won't break down

[Verse 2]
You don't know what I'm feeling
But I love when you don't know
I know you love me leaving
But I don't want to let go

You know this life I live
Hope I never change
Look me in my eyes
You can feel my pain
I've been gone for so long so long
Bury me inside of you coffin

I've been waiting over so long
You've been calling all night so gone
I can't wait I know you’re all wrong
Telling me to stay

[Chorus]
Fall
The way I fell myself
Today I won't break down
I know you call my name
Today I won't break down

[Bridge]
You don't know what I'm feeling
I know you love me leaving
Telling me to stay

[Chorus]
Fall
The way I fell myself
Today I won't break down
I know you call my name
Today I won't break down
