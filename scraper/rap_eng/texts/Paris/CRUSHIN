[Chorus]
Crushin' up weed like I'm crushin' on you (on you)
On you (on you)
And I've been thinkin' 'bout the things, every dirty little thing to do (to do)
To do (to do)
I ain't give you roses 'cause you ain't give me you (no, no)
Give me you (no, no)
Nothing you can say, you can save your excuse (save it)
Excuse (save it)

[Post-Chorus]
Pourin' up now, pullin' up now
You a let down, you don't get down
Always found out, always found out
Oh, you don't know love, guess you were the wrong one

[Verse]
When the feeling's all gone
You can't run forever, no
You don't gotta lie no more
No more, no, no, no
Now I'm just too far away (far away)
And you keep blowin' up my phone (phone)
So tell me what'd you do this for
No, no, no, no

[Chorus]
Crushin' up weed like I'm crushin' on you (on you)
On you (on you)
And I've been thinkin' 'bout the things, every dirty little thing to do (to do)
To do (to do)
I ain't give you roses 'cause you ain't give me you (no, no)
Give me you (no, no)
Nothing you can say, you can save your excuse (save it)
Excuse (save it)

[Post-Chorus]
Pourin' up now, pullin' up now
You a let down, you don't get down
Always found out, always found out
Oh, you don't know love, guess you were the wrong one

[Outro]
Crushin' up weed like I'm crushin' on you, on you
And I've been thinkin' 'bout the things, every dirty little thing to do, to do
I ain't give you roses 'cause you ain't give me you, give me you
Nothing you can say, you can save your excuse, excuse, yeah
