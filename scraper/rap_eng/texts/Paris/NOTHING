[Chorus]
You said you needed more for you, you wanted less of me
And then you left me at my worst, gave you the best of me
Now I have nothin' left to give, nothin' left to lose
Feel like there's no one else for me, nothin' else to do
You said you needed more for you, you wanted less of me
And then you left me at my worst, gave you the best of me
Now I have nothin' left to give, nothin' left to lose
Feel like there's no one else for me, nothin' else to do

[Post-Chorus]
Nothin' left to lose (to lose)
Nothin' left of you (of you)

[Verse]
No one really understands, at least I thought you would
Had too many one night stands here in Hollywood
I went and cancelled all my plans 'cause you said I should
Then you broke my heart in half like I knew you would
All I wanted was forever, but nah, nothin' lasts
Except this black Gucci sweater and these Prada pants
I wipe my tears with all my money, now I'm cryin' cash
I threw all your letters in the fuckin' trash

[Chorus]
You said you needed more for you, you wanted less of me
And then you left me at my worst, gave you the best of me
Now I have nothin' left to give, nothin' left to lose
Feel like there's no one else for me, nothin' else to do
You said you needed more for you, you wanted less of me
And then you left me at my worst, gave you the best of me
Now I have nothin' left to give, nothin' left to lose
Feel like there's no one else for me, nothin' else to do

[Post-Chorus]
Nothin' left to lose (to lose)
Nothin' left of you (of you)
