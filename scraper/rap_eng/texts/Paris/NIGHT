[Chorus]
Cross my heart and hope to die
Might not make it through tonight
Ask you once, I'll ask you twice
Am I who you want late at night?

[Verse]
I be wonderin' if I'm the only one
Like would you want me still if I ain't have this Louis on?
Until you came around I was comin' down
But then you changed it all, need you forever down

[Refrain]
Talkin' to myself ain't as fun
I only keep you 'round 'cause I know that you're the one
I woke up in a room that wasn't mine just because
Lookin' in your eyes got me thinkin' 'bout us

[Chorus]
Cross my heart and hope to die
Might not make it through tonight
Ask you once, I'll ask you twice
Am I who you want late at night?
Cross my heart and hope to die
Might not make it through tonight
Ask you once, I'll ask you twice
Am I who you want late at night?

[Refrain]
Talkin' to myself ain't as fun
I only keep you 'round 'cause I know that you're the one
I woke up in a room that wasn't mine just because
Lookin' in your eyes got me thinkin' 'bout us

[Chorus]
Cross my heart and hope to die
Might not make it through tonight
Ask you once, I'll ask you twice
Am I who you want late at night?
Cross my heart and hope to die
Might not make it through tonight
Ask you once, I'll ask you twice
Am I who you want late at night?

[Outro]
Cross my heart and hope to die
Might not make it through tonight
Ask you once, I'll ask you twice
Am I who you want late at night?
