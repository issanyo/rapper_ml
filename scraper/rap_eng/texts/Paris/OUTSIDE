[Chorus]
See you don't have to cry when you feel alone, yeah
I be feelin' low too
Dead inside, and you're not at home
Meet me outside, yeah
Day's all gone
I don't wanna wait that long
She don't wanna cry no more
Waitin' on the day I fall off
Fallin'

[Verse]
It don't take too much for me to leave, I'm on my way up
Thought you were the one, you taught me wrong and now we changed up
I can't go away, I'm still the same but now I'm paid up
All these faces change, rearrange like a jigsaw
All the pieces in place, only moment away
All it took was some time, knew it'd come one day
Now you want me right now when you're feelin' alone
Quick to change up, guess this ain't up

[Chorus]
See you don't have to cry when you feel alone, yeah
I be feelin' alone too
Dead inside, and you're not at home
Meet me outside, yeah
Day's all gone
I don't wanna wait that long
She don't wanna cry no more
Waitin' on the day I fall off
Fallin'
