[Hook: Paris]
I've been thinking about you all night
You've been thinking about the last fight
We've been holding onto what's right, for too long
I've been thinking about you all night
You've been thinking about the last fight
We've been holding onto what's right, for too long

[Verse 1: Paris]
We on different pages now
Both in different places now
Funny how shit changed around
Sometimes I wish you stayed down
Tried with me and tried again
Didn't have a heart to say it
All the things I never said are stuck replaying in my head
Can't forgive, can't forget
Probably bury me with my regrets
I thought you said you love me
Guess it ain't mean nothing
If I'm being honest, let me tell you something

[Hook: Paris]
I've been thinking about you all night
You've been thinking about the last fight
We've been holding onto what's right, for too long
I've been thinking about you all night
You've been thinking about the last fight
We've been holding onto what's right, for too long

[Verse 2: Landon Cube]
Oh you never know, with love
You never know
You never know what's going on inside
Through all the lies
Cause back then, you said it was okay
Now I can see that you live at your own pace
And you sniffing cocaine
And you left your daddy, you're out at your own place
And I miss your old face
Cause lately it seem you ain't wearing your own face
Shit it ain't okay
Just tell me, just tell me
This shit it ain't okay

[Hook: Paris]
I've been thinking about you all night
You've been thinking about the last fight
We've been holding onto what's right, for too long
I've been thinking about you all night
You've been thinking about the last fight
We've been holding onto what's right, for too long
