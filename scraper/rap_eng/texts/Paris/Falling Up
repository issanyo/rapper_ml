[Verse]
You don't have to feel my pain
Long as you can really hold me down, I know
You could be the realest from the fake
Won't take another chance don't wanna crowd my thoughts

[Pre-Chorus]
Running think I'm going M.I.A
Cuz' lately all these people wanna lie for love
Why they always wanna break away
Keep calling for my name don't wanna lie no more

[Chorus]
I've had enough
Won't let it change
Who's holding on
To take your place
Take more time than a little
You're falling up
Take more time than a little
It's time for change

[Verse]
You don't have to feel my pain
Long as you can really hold me down, I know
You could be the realest from the fake
Won't take another chance don't wanna crowd my thoughts

[Pre-Chorus]
Running think I'm going M.I.A
Cuz' lately all these people wanna lie for love
Why they always wanna break away
Keep calling for my name don't wanna lie no more

[Chorus]
I've had enough
Won't let it change
Who's holding on
To take your place
Take more time than a little
You're falling up
Take more time than a little
It's time for change
