[Chorus]
You my angel in that Saint Laurent
My Gucci shirt, come and take it off
You too damn good, never last that long
You my angel in that Saint Laurent
You my angel in that Saint Laurent
My Gucci shirt, come and take it off
You too damn good, never last that long
You my angel in that Saint Laurent

[Verse]
Scratch marks, nails black, show me you can take that
Bite me, might bury me inside a Maybach
Oh, Every time we fuck, it's for payback
It's always make bread, and ain't no takebacks
New Rick O, Raf, even when I mix I match
Baby back, body bag, push to start, I hit the gas
Every time we fuck, it's for payback
It's always make bread, and ain't no takebacks

[Chorus]
You my angel in that Saint Laurent
My Gucci shirt, come and take it off
You too damn good, never last that long
You my angel in that Saint Laurent
You my angel in that Saint Laurent
My Gucci shirt, come and take it off
You too damn good, never last that long
You my angel in that Saint Laurent
