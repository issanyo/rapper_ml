Hey little bird on the tree would you tell me something please
Do you ever feel alone around all these trees
Do you ever cry because they don't feel
Hey little bird on the tree would you tell me somethin real

They can't see who you are
Take my hand let's go far

Fly fly up to the sky
They can't hide your light
Just be free
Fly fly up to the sky
And you can just try
I'll set you free

Hey little bird don't you see, I'm just destined to be me
Trying to find an opportunity in this vast reality
Learned to live without fear in my own fantasy
So little bird don't you see I'm just destined to be free

They can't see who we are
Take my hand let's go far

Fly fly up to the sky
They can't hide your light
Just be free
Fly fly up to the sky
And you can just try
I'll set you free
