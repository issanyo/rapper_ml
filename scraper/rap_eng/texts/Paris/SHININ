[Chorus]
Stab me in the back, all you do is front
I stack up my cash, all I do is stunt
All I, all I, all I, all I do is stunt
Walked up in this bitch, I do what I want
Stab me in the back, all you do is front
I stack up my cash, all I do is stunt
All I, all I, all I, all I do is stunt
Walked up in this bitch, I do what I want

[Verse]
Got me a lot of hoes
Fel like I won the lotto though
Swear that I'm on a roll
She want my antidote
So I might just blow through the red light
I wanna see what the head like
She wanna see what the bed like, yeah
I turned a bad bitch into my new bae
I turned a Honda straight into a Wraith
Texted her phone and said I'm on my way
If I get pulled over it's gon' be a chase
My Hublot look like Merlot when the light hits
Swear that I'm on the graveyard, been workin' all night shifts
My legacy I'm leavin' gon' be timeless
And just like all my teeth you know I'm shinin'

[Chorus]
Stab me in the back, all you do is front
I stack up my cash, all I do is stunt
All I, all I, all I, all I do is stunt
Walked up in this bitch, I do what I want
Stab me in the back, all you do is front
I stack up my cash, all I do is stunt
All I, all I, all I, all I do is stunt
Walked up in this bitch, I do what I want
