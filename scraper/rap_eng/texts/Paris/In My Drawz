[Intro]
Yes, yes, party people
You know what? I'd like to welcome everybody back
Everybody back, into the house of Hard Truth
Hard Truth Soldier, that is
So, go ahead and take the gas mask off, and let the air subside
This is Guerrilla Funk, and you know who we about, okay
Matter of fact, I'ma quick talk to you this out

[Verse 1]
Some people say I'm contradictin'
Some say I'm not down with the cause
Some people say I'm just a hustler (hustler)
Some say I'm not revolutionary at all

[Pre-hook]
But if you lean back, you can see that
I'm just tryna spread the message, holdin' over where the G's at
So please, believe that, you gon' go ahead and preach that
"Power to the people," routine to some folks but I don't need that

[Hook]
Cause I got freedom in my draws, liberation in the chamber
Automatic justice when I bust, and my family don't feel no danger
I got freedom in my draws (freedom in my draws), liberation in the chamber
The president fightin' wars in my name, but I don't feel no safer
Now come on, man

[Verse 2]
Some say they're righteous when they might just roll a spliff and snort a line
Some say they're righteous when they might just be miked up the whole time
Some say they're righteous when they fornicate, drink wine, and eat swine
Then question me, but I just pay it no mind

[Pre-hook]
But if you lean back, you can see that
I'm just tryna spread the message, holdin' over where the G's at
So please, believe that, you gon' go ahead and preach that
"Power to the people," routine to some folks but I don't need that

[Hook]
Cause I got freedom in my draws, liberation in the chamber
Automatic justice when I bust, and my family don't feel no danger
I got freedom in my draws (freedom in my draws), liberation in the chamber
The president fightin' wars in my name, but I don't feel no safer
Now come on, man

[Verse 3]
Now let me see you gangster walk to the White House
Bring your paperwork, groove, and they about to cut your lights out
Matter of fact, bring all your bills
And tell 'em you need your reparations paid right now
Relatives still smokin' that pie out
In the fourth quarter of life with no time out
Second thought, they ain't seein' what I'm sayin'
Dog, go to the trunk and bring them back thy mouth
Two kids in the backseat cryin' out
"Daddy, that the man you always rhyme 'bout?"
Yes, kids
He's also the man daddy said was the reason that we ain't had breakfast
Now be quiet, 'cause he's tryin'
To dodge me and say my cheque got mailed out, but he's lyin'
Matter of fact, why should I keep on tryin' to bust a rap
When I got a strap?

[Hook]
Cause I got freedom in my draws, liberation in the chamber
Automatic justice when I bust, and my family don't feel no danger
I got freedom in my draws (freedom in my draws), liberation in the chamber
The president fightin' wars in my name, but I don't feel no safer
Now come on, man

[Outro]
Some say they're righteous
