Counting (prod. Pro Logic)

Chorus x2
40 days and counting I'm going to sleep

Verse 1 (Minty Burns)
I've been a stray what people do to get that green today
That Golden Mile I lead the way I give a fuck what people say
Ain't sleep for days it's been a long and crazy journey chiefing Marley
Man I love this shit I ain't trying to leave the party
Because we the party this is my house my house
That's the lab where I cook shit up but this time we gonna dine out
I've been on my shit for 40 days EQ reverb no delay
Mac Book Pro Tools call my name then what I do I go away
To a zone where the people don't bother me palm trees everywhere it got to be
Built this shit me and all my team so I wouldn't be happy with the lottery
Snap back for the crew get the order right
Fire up a doob for the Florida flight ATX I was smoking right at the fader fort did it over night

Chorus x4
40 days and counting I'm going to sleep

Verse 2 (Minty Burns)
Reefer Madness ain't sleeping we living lavish
They seem so average while me I'm at Caesars Palace
Chasing dreams without making cream don't wait too long or its gone
Like a chick you met a couple nights ago and the numbers not in your phone
Backtrack to those days Fast Times at Mint Mont High
Think about those times we had I swear to God not a day goes by
Got to provide for my lifestyle same time got to look all fly
One border north side I got em show time
Come up all so presidential risk I take so detrimental
Won't stop until my voice is heard all throughout your complex residential
Reason they want to see me fail 4 star in Fort Lauder-dale
Whole stock rising on a scale but my grind and work is not for sale

Chorus x4
40 days and counting I'm going to sleep

Verse 3 (GLC)
My days are stuck on autopilot nights are stuck in party mode
Fast pace switch up different cities only one place that I call my home
T dot knows how Mint roll know they loved that home grown
Some say boy go do your thing and some say please just don't go
I got to get it before it's gone can't be waiting too long
We put in that overtime while you waking up for your alarm clock
What's the motto don't stop one stop at the smoke shop
Cannabis connoisseur damn right I take the whole pot
We riding through the city future looking pretty
Bright is that blue diamond we make magic with that MIDI
I'm glad you like what I do rap life is so cool
I'll be gone for about 40 days but that I'm coming back to get you Reno

Chorus x4
40 days and counting I'm going to sleep
