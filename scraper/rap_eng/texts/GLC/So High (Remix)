[Chorus: Kyle Lucas]
I'm high, so high, so high
Mother fucker
I'm high so high so high so high so high
I ain't coming down, and i ain't coming back
I'm high, so high, so high

[Verse 1: Kyle Lucas]
Light up
Yea yea yea
In the oc with 2 Emcee's
I got an oz of the og
And i'm OT with the OP
It's a matter a fact they know me
But it's all good cause i know Mills
And i flow with GLC
It's packed in this hotel
And theirs snow here
She ain't try'na leave
Ok smoke fills up like Oatmeal
One hit will leave her room filled
Plus i mixed like four pills
I'm so still like roadkill
My cups so filled
Stuff so chill she on my coat tails
This chicks so high sniff of that white
All blown up like my phone bill
I can't move but the rooms spinning
Y'all ask me if that good living
Like turn to my baby that's blurred vision
She persistent to burn incense
Light it up its her turn to hit it
She want a cut like incision
Eyes rolled back call a mortician
If you so burred abort mission
That shit just ain't just gunna happen round here
Get a pound burn it down around here
I got a pack of the loud and i like the way that sounds
Shit i'm up in the clouds and i ain't coming down

[Chorus: Kyle Lucas]
I'm high, so high, so high
Mother fucker
I'm high so high so high so high so high
I ain't coming down, and i ain't coming back
I'm high, so high, so high

[Verse 2: T. Mills]
Hey yo it's MILLion
I stay higher than the Ceiling
Im really on girls sippin purple ribbon
Got me feeling on
Im in the zone
Bought another mechanic
I smoke black trees grown organic
Im down in long beach but im from another planet
Call me kurt with some purp
Dont forget the captain
I saw your girl so you know i had to stop her
Had her flying in my helicopter
Thank you for your offer
She dont blow this much
Excuse me she a cougher
Oh hello officer
Thats my cutie take off
She dont know whats up with all those clothes i had to take off i think i should just break it off
Boy what am i thinking
I just met this girl
I dont know her not a wee bit
I fucked her like a wee bit
While asking for my leaf lid
Then a cock block from a cop
Left me high or seeming

[Chorus: Kyle Lucas]
I'm high, so high, so high
Mother fucker
I'm high so high so high so high so high
I ain't coming down, and i ain't coming back
I'm high, so high, so high


[Verse 3: GLC]
Ye player im so high
Blowing on the kush an the dro fire
Pimp shit leaving dont die
Pimp tied up like bow ties
Pimping these hoes im so tired
Rolled up to the H three twenty five
Tricking these lames
Getting that change
Smoking that green i dont mind
Coming up short in your ride
Bitch get the fuck on your man
Dont make money on your time
Straight from the bottle I incline
Smoking this purple haze'n
I swear im feeling amazing
Trying to resist the smell of a pimp
Smoking with a pimp she gave in
Im the max sensation
Blaze ??????evasive
Sativa is out-rated her friend came to look she gravitate to the smell of the kush
Yell at hoe and she look?
Yea im a crook
You keep smoking them seeds man
You should change your weed man
Why do you think she leavin
Too come be with me man
GLC ??????????
Smoking on the green as i put in work
Looking for the seeds
Smoking my trees
Its OG you ain't gotta search
Too unclear to finish GLC's verse

[Outro: Kyle Lucas]
I'm high, so high, so high
Mother fucker
I'm high so high so high so high
I'm high so high so high so high
Mother fucker
I'm high so high so high so high
So high so high
I ain't coming down
And i ain't coming back
I ain't coming down and i ain't coming back
So high so high
