Man I shine like mister Clean
Got more gold than mister t
Pretty girls in the mist for me
Got more chips like chips ahoy
My game is Cole as Melyssa Ford
Takin' trips, chips and horres
Blinded by the light
Yeah she says my... change
Yeah she says my angel wings
Girl better do what you do to your face
Look like she might put Maybelline
Bitch she say pullin' out
Up all in and out my baller jeans
I think that's what she became

Up on the road when the light hit
Just turned on like light switch
Right there stop thinkin' of
What type of... she might get
Now she got no gansgta bitch
She take a pitch where I can see her
One in a million look like Aalyah
Blinded by the light

Once she tear me what's the sound

Like getting' money since 17

She never had been on a plane
Could have flown to LAX
But I preffer to do...
On the ground like...
Collars pop like elvis prez

Blinded by the light
Off the plane to her daddy
She cut her hair
She looked like Ali
On the map like...

Brand new bag, yeah she got it
Brand new jet, yeah I got it
We drive back like automatic
Blinded by the light
Off to the party
And Ali is...
On to the...

Spaceship yes I will

Blinded by the light
