(Hook: Toya 2X)
Right, I’m lovin this life
Every night is a Saturday night
After dark moguls we shine on site
A List Celebrity

[Verse 1: Omekka]
Underground A-List Celebs
Rumor is we washed up we bathing in Hermes
That’s so from Paris we are paired in Paris
Me and J Pierre we compare to the rare
Walking down Chaum se leisse think we ball players
If we ball players we compared to Gale Sayers
You the doers we the sayers yeah you do what we say-uh
Presidential mind fall back like the mayor
Never fed the feds on current affairs I swear
Coco beware a paris up in my air
Women naysayers
They sayin that we are players
I’m fly I’m the heir of the air I inherit
Every step is a stair swear that they fair
SYY bought five thousand shares
I see now why Sonny divorced Cher
When they’re sunny in the bones know the skeletons are there

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Geechi Suede]
Fall into illustrious limitless luxury leaning on dirty wealth
Every night is a Saturday holiday celebrate yourself
Boats in the backyard, Triple Onyx Black Cards
Still keep a sawed off, penthouse at the Waldorf
A List Celebrity she singing to my melody
Quality and quantity bottles of that Donald P
Gator flavor major maker poker player Suede ah (right)
Take it to Tequile shake it thorough with a blender (right)
We live it like we love it and we love it like we live it
Twist another cigar make it bigger when you roll it
We live in the glitter you picture the best
We swim in the glamour unglimmer the rest
We counting it heavy then swerving it left
One step Two Step
A List we make this look so ritz
Eight sips you decked out then play this

[Hook]

[Bridge: Kaye Fox]

[Verse 3: GLC]
I’m the most official mack ever encountered
