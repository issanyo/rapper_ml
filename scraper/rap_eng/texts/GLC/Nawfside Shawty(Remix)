[Verse 1: GLC]
Southside youngin' baggin' hoes cashing checks, you ain't getting money I can't show you no respect, stayin' in the studio playin' with my tech aye brand new Nikes I be runnin' to a check mirror mirror on da wall boy you a mess getting all this paper so I can't even stress, got a new yacht and it's got a party deck chill with my niggas and all we do is flex

[Hook]
Where you headin' to the bank smelling like some stank (x8)

[Verse 2: GLC]
Gettin' money gettin' money never broke, so much money spent 250 on a coat, soft queen with some lean designer on my clothes and I ain't even had it back designer on my hoes yeah, always on the track but I never take long l, and if he ain't fresh then he better get lost, look so stiff I just cope it for the cost, and all I do is hop in the ghost and get lost

[Hook]
Where you headin' to the to the bank smellin' like some stank (x8)

[Verse 3: JCSTIFFY]
Where you headin' to the bank smellin' like some stank, cross that nigga so hard that I had him on skates, went to my niggas house to cop a double plate, saw this fine ass girl at school but she tryin' hate, so many bands I just go and buy a wraith, pullin' up to Bush with my music playin' loud, cause later this song is goin' on soundcloud
