Life would be different if Benji had made it to the pros
If Moms was still here, if Kevin wasn't gone
Made 25 this morning, guess these my birthday wishes ya'll
So uh, So uh
So as I blow out these candles I'm hoping you understanding why your
Writing on wax is not fire igniting
Swear GL said it right cause I lost my momma then I lost my mind
And I ain't got time like a bare wrist
Compare this, to parakeets or parodies get embarrassed
Grow a pair of these before you stand on the chariot
Pressing buttons try and blow me, do I look like a clarinet?
Nigga, you a Harriet, Winslow, sleeping with the opps
My kinfolk, praise me like a temple, god, son, shout my nigga Na$
He got this tempo throbbing like a temple
I could lose my job next week like a temp though, por ejemplo
Where that nigga Pill go?  He was on the billboards, he was on the freshman 10 though
Do this shit for we like Nintendo, still though
Not a nigga for these hoes to play with, no, I am not a Ken doll(Naw)
I swear, in bad weather say I won't prevail, there is not a chance
I'll make it hail in hell, that's hell freezing over god damn
I am, the definition of determination, that dedication, and discipline
I'm Ben Wilson in '84 I stress, my bloodline the best
Shout out Auntie Marie, Big Curt, Anthony, and Jeff
I look like success to these niggas and just like sex to these women
Fresh Connection my linen, and I swear that I'm smooth
That's word to Jigga and Killa
I'm off a fifth of the henny, but you know vodka my preference
If it's a celebration why I'm the one with the presence
But still missing the cake
That's kind of strange yeah, strange yeah, eerie in fact
I'm superior great, from here on, I'ma kill 'em
Oooh kill 'em that's on Terio chain

Ohh Lord, sweet Lord I just pray some Angel Wings fit me
On this road to the top I bring my people with me
If they can't go it ain't worth it, it ain't worth

[GLC]
Boy I still drinkin', still thinkin', rotatin' and still linkin'
Man I fucked this bitch last night,  on the G she was still kinky
Always want to suck me off, she a freak like Mimi Faust
Lame niggas try and lay me down, I play them niggas just like lacrosse
I am the boss, I am the ISM, cathedralfied, I am the vision
Lame niggas can't fuck with me, because they make these lame decisions
Niggas know that it's never over, so much game I feel like Yoda
Cathedralfied, I'm on the rise, said so much game I feel like Yoda
They getting high just to get by, goofy niggas want to see me die
Goofy niggas don't want to see me fly, I am the ISM bitch I rep the Chi
From the Chi out to Rocky, goofy niggas try and see me fall
Cathedralfied, say fuck 'em all, these goofy niggas they gon' see me ball
Yeah fool I feel like Benji, stupid niggas want to come and get me
Bet I do not give a fuck, because I got to keep this game up in me
Still bad in Chicago, damn it's Chiraq
Goofy niggas want to fuck with me but these goofy niggas can't come back
ISM!
