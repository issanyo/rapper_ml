[Verse 1: GLC]
Man what a life merlot over the ice
Feeling kinda gifted here shawty was right
Blow a little kush then call it a night
My ism is a plus sound mac in device
Never set aside nothing will suffice
Until she went to church my vision will entice
Her to get naked, may only take a second
Church on the move my ism is effective
Solidified limit is on the rise
Bring your girl around and then let her decide
Pro with game equipped with a poet aim
Burn out these lames' game like yoga flame
Once she hear that weak ass shit she gonna complain
Man I give her hope like the pope do
High hopes I let her roll and smoke too
When she went to church she see dreams come true
At the Ritz grab your crew and come through
Coming to fruition, pay lawyer fees never pay tuition
As We proceed to get cheese and flicking
Haters aggravated, mad a player made it
Mr GLC my paper done levitated
All throughout the 'Go, I had to let em know
Riding in the fast line, just came from driving slow

[Hook:Josephine]
I'm so high, I'm so high
I hope I'll never come down
So if I fall, if I fall
I hope I land on the cloud
I'm so high, so high
I'm standing on higher ground
So if I fall, if I fall
I hope I land on the cloud

[Verse 2:Phil Ade]
So much for you niggas that didn't believe
I Swear my next vaca' is a trip to Belize
Who you niggas out plotting on, shit puh'lease
I had my niggas get at em like living with Eve
I be in K street Sunday, Eden on Monday
Benz ain't mine but picture me in a Hyundai
Mmm nah, that ain't fit in the frame
They ain't as fly as Phil, wire sale fit with the frames
Get paid to party now shit is insane
All I can think about is money swear that shit is engrained
Can blame with what I came from, pain from a pay stub
With a couple of digits like they must have been kidding
Had enough school it was interrupting my mission
My mom like look at all that stuff I missing
And in my head I'm saying look at all the stuff I'm getting
Got a whole wardrobe from being tough with the spitting
In the club with the dub sack stuck in my pants
And something top shelf in the cup that I'm sipping
Haters what are you tripping for? tweeting subliminal
I'm on and I ain't coming off your screen like its pick-n-roll
When it's over I give-n-go
Even though the flow is three below
Got these hoes giving up cerebral
I'mma keep it go for now I'm hustling
The game I'm just in now I gotta get that Bieber dough
Sunny I swear that most rappers is losers
We indie balling you niggas should call us Hoosiers
Hold on to your soul you can lose yours
Hold on to your hoes I could use yours
I'm here to move and soar to new heights
To prove you niggas wrong and all my dudes right
To show you my endeavors for the better
So even when I fall you'll remember me forever

[Hook]

Pulled up in the S class, blowing the best grass
Walk straight in we don't need a guest pass
No time for your feelings girl just ass
And if your man want a problem he can just ask
Grab a glass pour the red berry
Tonight let's get throwed, hail mary
So let the j go round and round and watch it all come crashing down
