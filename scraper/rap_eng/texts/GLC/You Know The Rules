[Verse 1: Sir Michael Rocks]
I just landed in the land from Atlanta on a late flight
Panoramic views out the window to the pool
He was playing that po' pimping out the windows of the Lincoln
Navigator, glad he had endo in his glove box
'Iers on his temples, fast with the tempo
And he smash on the gas, getting cash with his kinfolk
He never get skipped when they pass around the endo
Nope, I make the 'Lac get low and do the limbo
On the Lake Shore Drive, Rich South High in them hallways
We wished we was ball playing niggas who was All-State
Wind pipe exhaust game, sick on that Audi thang
Nautica Nice Guys tame bitches that you thought was crazy
Now we out in Matteson twisting spliffs and now we coughing crazy
I can't be lazy, especially when it's payment season
Season vets telling me to get my circle tight
Squeezing all them other niggas outside
They ain't got a reason to be in there

[Hook: Sir Michael Rocks]
You know the rules in this game we play
Most we can do is keep everything straight
This is a game that you can't reply
So roll the dice let em lay em where they may

[Verse 2: GLC]
Aggravating, hallucinating, tryna let go of my frustrations
Sit down with some wealthy niggas, you gon' help me get some paper?
If not I keep it moving
Don't give in to frequent rumors
