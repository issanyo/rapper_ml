[Verse 1: XV]
What got in her is all them girls that got in her
Ear when she heard that old nerd is newly popular
Getting looks of you on facebook, saying "X fine!"
This is when Urkel turned into Stefan
Unless I'm going crazy
And all of these ladies always liked dude
I was like Common & Kanye: too shy, dude
Now they mad when I move how I move
That's how your hoes turn to foes like 2 times 2
See, I knew it would happen with the rappin
And they lacking and they cashing
The kid in band class has got em on the band wagon
Blast from the past, chicks in class, I was passing
Notes to, they checkmark the box they said no to
I'm a new man like Randy, you can't stand your old dude
And when I ask about him you say "me and him are so through!"
All of the time I gave you all of my time
Now I got none to give and I'm all on your mind..

[Hook: GLC] x2
Now it's up to you to say that you were wrong
When I knew all along you'd call my phone
And shawty
(You can only blame yourself)
When you just hear the tone
Don't leave a message and just leave me alone

[Verse 2: Emilio Rojas]
Remember when you left me? You right for me now
I couldn’t get the time of day
Now you want nights on the town, right
But a threesome what I like right now
Life a bitch and karma’s a bitch, I’m dykin' it out
Like mama mama mama, you could be the one
Really, I ain’t fuckin' with you, you should be a nun
If you want a reason from me, I would say because
I told you because no love cause I’m over you, over you
I roll with a chosen few, no one was as cold as you
Your heart is like some frozen food
When I would go to school, I would get ignored
You toy with my emotions like pieces on a board
I’m Jordan and scorin' it in at every turn
Before the kid was pennin', you was never concerned
Now a phsycician in a clinic askin' “when you gon learn?”
Just tell that bitch, it isn’t pimpin' if you never been burned

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Casey Veggies]
She heard me screamin
Joined back on the team then
Started loving me more
The art of winning that war
These women don't love these artists
They often take them to stores
And hope that they get em the presents
With money we made on tour
That's cold: but you know, life ain't fair
When I needed you most
You see, your life wasn't there
When I leave here and coast
Now the phone rings bells
Looking at it while we blow L's and press decline
I'm fine on all that
Got too much on my mind, it's time to fall back
Caught up in the grind and you trying to crawl back
My heart is in these lines, hope this markers soon be fine
I hope these models love wine and these white jacuzzi towels
Roll with the winners, Ruth's Chris dinners
All good intentions, chasing dreams, like a J O B
See me shining, now I'm on a track with GLC
