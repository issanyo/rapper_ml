Let me get my theme music
Let me get my theme music
Aye, let me get my theme music
Aye, let me get my theme music

Baby, just forget everything that you know
Let's take it all the way back to hello
They say you livin' like you died before
I got a place that only I can go

Let me take you to flight school
(We'll learn to fly)
Let me take you to flight school
(Above all the lights)

You've never been so high
Kiss the ground goodbye
And you say, damn, baby, how did you get that fly?
Flight school

I got the airplane passes, the Aviator glasses
She be lookin' fly like Aviator classes
So classy, Jacqueline Onassis
Used to sneak and move like Ali, Cassius

Massive, like Kennedy's assassin
We was killin' time like clocks in the casket
Perhaps it's time to prevail
I'll show you Gotham City like I'm Christian Bale

I can be Barack and let you be Michelle
My girl, Giselle, dress fresh as hell
Louis, Gucci, yeah, in that pastel
Adore Dior, ride down Lake Shore

She felt the vibe, I had to make sure
She felt deprived, livin' like she died
Slide with a G, now she felt revived
In town for the night, she's somebody wifey

The LE, she never seen these
So the moment I might seize
I done come up out the coma of livin' life's dreams
When you wake up in the morning you join the flight team

Baby, just forget everything that you know
Let's take it all the way back to hello
They say you livin' like you died before
I got a place that only I can go

Let me take you to flight school
(We'll learn to fly)
Let me take you to flight school
(Above all the lights)

Hey, you've never been so high
Kiss the ground goodbye
And you say, damn, baby, how did you get that fly?
Flight school

I got my Superman power, my Superman cape
These the last hours, but Superman late
The clock is ticking, damn, can you wait?
Man, will he come back and save the day?

Fly across the earth, put things in reverse
I wish this life was a movie I could just rehearse
Certain things I can't doctor and you say I'm the worst
I ain't have enough patients, but I needed a nurse

That'll come by my bed late
See if my head ache
Then get my head straight
Then give me head, great

Every time I popped up like the VCR
I took your breath away
Then we performed CPR
With all the cars, the clothes, the lights, the boats

I guess I was just trying to sow my raw oats
In the Penthouse position
With Penthouse bitches
See I pimp'd my crib, so I must exhibit

Shit, these last year's been a haze like Issac
So I close my eyes
Tighter than Asian eyes get
Realized I got the same wings angels fly
With Louie Vutton feathers, now that some fly shit

Baby, just forget everything that you know
Let's take it all the way back to hello
They say you livin' like you died before
I got a place that only I can go

Ooh, let me take you to flight school
(We'll learn to fly)
Ooh, let me take you to flight school
(Above all the lights)

Hey, you've never been so high
Kiss the ground goodbye
And you say, damn, baby, how did you get that fly?
Flight school
