[Verse 1: Kallay]

Champagne flutes I toast those
Kush strains I roast those
So player I coach hoes
Not Hall of fame but I'm close though
Schizophrenic flow switcher
Love trees but don't blow swisher
Might fuck a ho but I don't kiss her
Young Chi guy a real go getter
Stay round pussy like kitty litter
I bob and weave like hair nigga
Feeling like that Mohican cause I'm the last real nigga breathin
I'm just living progressively your tomorrow's my yesterday
Hustle excessively chasing destiny what the method be
Fuck I look like never seeing 7 figures
Then I'm no different from none of these other niggas
I refuse to lose like Jordan in game 6
Bad chicks plush kicks tryna get rich
Investing in myself with every dollar I earn
Cause not punching a clocks my #1 concern
I'm passed the point of no return pass the joint and watch it burn
Pass me over watch and learn the passion you see in return

[Hook:GLC]

No ya role, play ya role
Take the road, pay the toll
Watch it all take it's toll
That's how the game pose to go.(2x)
(Repeat)

[Verse 2: Chuck L.I.]

Church on a movement
Whip got a pulpit
Riding like the pope no bangs when I'm moving
Bitches choosing you'd be truant if you didn't know I'm chosen
Money nasty what I'm grossing man I'm tryna buy a ocean
(On god)
Really I'm finessin
Ain't no sense in stressin
Unless niggas Smith and Wesson
Then I'll be investin
Rolling up that sticky wit Missy
My whip look like its a hickey
I'm sitting on them 24's I call em griffey's
I'm picky stop critiquing my shit you know how scholars get
Fuck a metaphor I ain't met a million dollars yet
Ism dripping down to my shoulders it got my collar wet
Give her back shots in the backlot til I hollar back
Shorty pour the henny up
Rub a nigga back or somethin
Man get the swisher sweets roll a nigga pack or somethin
I don't fuck wit most of these lames dawg they lackin somethin
I always play my role
They be like do you act or somethin

[Verse 3: Kallay]

Say he god like cause I'm made in his image
Hard life so I'm blazing the spinach
Ounce of OG 2 dimes and a grimace
Cause life ain't shit but a race to the finish
It's the young stoner paper plane roller
So high probably up somewhere solar
Recovering weed addict six seconds sober
My new miss from ole miss was miss October
That's a college girl and a model chick
A sophisticated lady who moscato sip
Feeling like Orville wright Jedi knight every bar I writes like neon light
Bright, my minds at an airplane height
Mid flight and rising this just round one
Living out my dreams never scared of the outcome
Cause it ain't over til Precious drop a album, Nigga!

[Hook]

[Outro: Kallay]

No offense to Pipp I gotta be the man
(Be the man)
Young and fly forever just like Peter Pan
(Just like Peter Pan)
Better under pressure like charcoal
Been through hells flames but my heart cold
Never put a price tag on my soul
These other rappers might as well come wit a bar code
I'm guessing records ain't the only thing y'all sold
Said them records ain't the only thing y'all sold
