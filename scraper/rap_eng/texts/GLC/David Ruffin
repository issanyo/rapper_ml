[Louie P. Newton]
Say she never seen a dream sold like this before
Or encountered one that's cold like this before
Swore she wouldn't fall for it, then she seen I'm missin' more
And keep askin' me why I'm creatin' all this distance for
It's traditional, church but not a piscopo
I make her work for that position, it's a privilege ho
Her first taste of red wine and medicinal
And I ain't mad, she think my belt buckle is mistletoe
I ain't dissin' though, it's strictly principle
Stay poppin' tags homie, I ain't missin' dough
And it's probably cause I'm gettin' chose
And she workin' so hard, I can get another chick fa sho
She know I'm hardly home, party with my Carti's on
And get Wolfgang Puck fresh at the drop of a button
With no discussion, like it's nothin'
I take it till she realize that she was bluffin'
I'm cold on 'em

[Hook]
She give me everything
Tell me I don't owe her nothin'
They say I'm cold on these hoes

It's James Jones, drug zone
Meet your neighbor, hoodlum
They say I'm cold on these hoes, I came up from nothin'
Slangin' bowls for them pros, every day I'm hustlin'
We get the low, get 'em gone, in a day it's nothin'
Got the trap bunkin', my connect Russian/rushing
When I double what you cop, now that's frontin'
Niggas frontin' like they live, nigga stop frontin'
Cause that shit'll get you shot, and I'm not bluffin'
We'll run up in your spot, get to bustin' plural
Now his block's a mural, full of Care Bears and Teddy Ruxpins
Runnin' from the black and yellows, black and yellows, packin' metal
Had to throw my crack and ran go get my thumper
Cause the other day they found my nigga in the dumpster
Thinkin' 'bout all the dirt we did when we was youngsters
Led astray, the hood try'na take me under
Streets didn't kill me, only made me stronger

A pimp from the 'go, I give a ho
Some pimpin' to go, my ism critical
Amnesia pimpin', I hit it then forget a ho
Girl I beat that pussy up, call that boy Riddick Bowe
Teddy Pendergrass, Love TKO
Countin' plenty cash, blowin' kush and plenty hash
It's what we have, playa what you got?
That 31 from the Pacers
We gettin' paper, let this ism motivate you
? bother them ass shots, trusty in your stash spot
Man I just gave her game to change her from a have not
Who she gave that paper to the moment that she came out
Why she came in here with you and leavin' in my fast car?
Fool, she drove on a player call it Nascar
Y'all speedballin', fallin' like I'm John ??
Cold on these hoes, chuuch, Pope John Paul
