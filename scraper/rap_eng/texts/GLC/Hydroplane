This record is fueled by the Yael Naim cover of Britney Spears' "Toxic"
Chopping a few bars throughout the song and a few vocal snippets, then combining the heavy 808's and dirty snares and bouncy hats to create to "high" octane spaceship for Mic and GLC to whip around the city


[Intro]

[Hook: Mic Terror]
I want to fly a plane
I need something to take me higher,higher, higher, higher, higher
I think I want to go to space
I need something to take me higher,higher, higher, higher, higher
Sometimes I want to fly a plane
I need something to take me higher,higher, higher, higher, higher
I think I want to go to space
I want something to take me higher,higher, higher, higher, higher

[Verse 1: Mic Terror]
That one girls' pussy was good,this new girls' pussy seems better
It's something about it seems wetter,when I'm fucking and I just met her
And I don't even know what your name is,but you giving me good brainage
And you graduated from Cambridge,maybe Oxford
Her boyfriend? what my Glock's for,she on my dick because I'm not poor
You think she bad? I got a lot more,with a lot more
In the back and in the front,you get the gin, I get the blunts
I'm hitting the weed,I'm high as fuck,I like to drink and I like to fuck

[Hook]

[Verse 2: GLC]
My game cold,frostbit,running hoes,exhausted
Lames used to have some pimpin' but somehow they lost it
Swear my Ism is Kelsy Grammar,I'm always on boss shit
El Dog Cadillac,with a duel pipe exhaust kit
On my pimpin' her guy hatin',she so thirsty,dehydrated
If you blowin' my high baby,I'm gon' tell you goodbye baby
Can't bring me down,I'm skyscrapin',I love the money,I'm cakin'
These hoes are feeling my vibrations, they love to see their guy make it
South Side,Chi native,made my goal to get rich daily
Mentality is bitch pay me,must be thinking I'm a little crazy
While I'm blowing this kush haters,steady counting this green paper
Out here smoking on green acres,go wherever our dreams take us
I do this shit like a G's supposed to do
Never let these simps get close to you
They tell other simps that they smoke with you
And now you got pimp niggas roastin' you

[Hook]

[Outro]
