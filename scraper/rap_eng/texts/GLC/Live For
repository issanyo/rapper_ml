[Verse 1]
Yow yow
I wish i wish you would scratch my paint
With mah team in this bitch I dont give a fuck who ain't
Pouring out that piss in that shit gang
Ninety Five on the pedal ninety seven in the tank
I Just fuck the wheels offa this bitch
Almost got the breaks done tryna kiss me on the lips
Almond tips piss the leather on the three prong wheels
Ladies slow down when you pass the dealership
Playing with the big dogs roaming off the leech
Spin the block on these niggas bro I think that was the deal
Rolling on foot watch the signs of the streets
Thank the lord for them times when it could a been me
Yeah niggas thought that they was tell em think again
Breezing with the pack playing in the wind
Dread on the phone bread on the phone
Niggas just be rappin songs we getting head on the phone
Shead a tear share a thought tell mah youngest shead the block
As the world keeps turning on mah old head watch
Hand on mah crotch a tracy in mah sack
You know who gettin the money whether you feel them or not
Fuck with me i get you paid talkin a lot
Heard some niggas was hating yeah talkin a lot
Care a none them im gettin weeded, yeah sparkin a lot
Open the door to the pigeon coop I fly off the top
Neven wanna inhale around the goofy nigga
Lights so blinding be so much smoke and mirror
Gotta see in time and thinking this you know
Hustle hard stack you money up and then flip it
Anywhere you lay your head at you supposed to get it
There ain't room in this world for a bullshit nigga
If you ain't livin by yo own rules whatcha livin for
Its more to life than breathing its about survival

[Hook]
All my life all I had was a dream so you can't tell me what to live for
All my live all I have was me so so so so
All my life all I had was a dream so you can't tell me what to live for
All my live all I have was me so so so so

[Verse 2]
The gone plot when they see you sitting at the top
You touch yah paper And they watchin everything you got
Stash house boy they watching how you cash out
You try to help em but they hatin shit never stop
You came up and they feeling like they left out
Situations make a hater pull that mask out
See them laying there like the leaking till they passed out
Slow money man they tryna take the fast route
When they broke then you in like a cash cow
Eating Green pastures like nebraska
How yah heart cold like alaska
How yah body cold in the casket
Say you wanna bawl do you know what you was asking
Know what you was wishing
Feel you can't trust em man trust your intuition
Ism God guy tryna tell you something you should try tha listen
Niggas say they love you be the same niggas snitching
Broke from the street cause his business is risky
I lead you to the light like jesus did the Christians

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
I never understood why niggas hate
When you get something mama told me dont let the world take nothing from you
Show your hand you throw that stone rumble young and rumble
Niggas always try to be something end up be fronting
Ain't no shame in shit you do
If its love in it niggas say they hard but they ain't got no G in em
Put that on the dutch and the bud in it
In the head First jump in it
Ima keep thugging it
We in it for the long run a list niggas that ever hand  me shit
Is a short one weak such a strong word
You can't say the same anything that pays nowadays that's the way
Yeah you got and they want it, ain't that ballin what they call it
It ain't all about the money but it feel good don't it
Got em hundreds in yo pocket try to count it
You can't fold it yeah the game turn ya stoic
Homie whats your story, No niggas
No no what they told niggas
Fronting like the big willie
But really joe niggas hoe niggas
Hating on your come up want to be your competition
Keep you in reach with em I bet that fuckin deep nigga

[Hook]
