[Verse 1: GLC]
The truth they just can’t handle it
They say he just too scandalous
I got my 7's on, man I feel I had to pimp
Demonstrating aqua 8's, feeling fine in my white 9's
Jordan back in '91, yeah fool it’s my time
I’m shining now, the ism flying
I am the Chi, na-na-na-na
I’m fly like Zeus, my bitch divine
She say she chose a G, cause my grey 5's
In the Chi, man we stood in line for 'em
Gangsters did time, did crimes, just to shine from 'em
And the hoes love the vibe of 'em
First sign of an addict is denial
But I love 'em

[Hook: GLC]
Something bout these black 3's that make these girls attack me. [x8]

[Verse 2: GLC]
Something bout these black 3's that make these girls attack me
Rock 'em with my Leader’s hat and I’m a mack exactly
Elevate the ism, when I’m pimping naturally
Something bout these blue 4's
That make me get some new hoes
They ain’t fly, they peek mine's
They just play the guest role
Get us by(?), carolina 9's
Always make me get chose
Olmypic 7's, black 11's
Man these shoes is jacking hefty(?)
GLC gonna do his thang
Six ring, macking expert(?)
Ferrari's on, sorry holmes
Man you got them replicas, Sizike's not Spizike's
Yeah fool you messing up, where the hell you get them from
Your shoes disrespecting us
God blessed me with some Jordan's, then God blessed America
