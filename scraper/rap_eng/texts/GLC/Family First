[Verse 1 - MJ]
My family's not perfect, but they're perfect for me
Know they love me, would do anything for me
When I reach a new level
I'mma meet a new devil
I'm young, tryin' to find my place in this world
Hate seeing the ones I love in pain
Problems on top of fucking problems
Lord knows I'm tryin' to find a way
Don't no money will bring us closer
But it's tearing us apart
Don't no money will bring us closer
But it's tearing us apart
I got a good head on my shoulders
Need a cry? Here's my shoulder, here for you
On everything I love, you are everything I love
That's on everything I love

[Chorus]
Cause it's family over everything
Over everything
Over everything
Family over everything
Cause it's family over everything
Over everything
You can call me
If you need anything
Cause it's family over everything
Over everything
Over everything
Family over everything
Cause it's family over everything
Hey, hey, hey
At the end, that's all I have

[Verse 2 - GLC]
They show support when you're on that lonely path
You look up and you find out that that's all you have
My sister [?] and when mama died
She put her life on hold only so that I could shine
My brother got that cancer but he gon' survive
And we gon' keep partyin' like '99
My niggas is my brothers, [?] not my guys
Trials and tribulations, that's what make you wise
It's hard to be honest in the face of lies
Niggas get more time for conspiracy than takin' lives
Don't rush your hustle seriously just take your time
I help you face your issues as if they was mine
Haters hate, they don't wanna see you shine
?? man, it's nothin' over family ties
My man came home, he took the honor roll
My nephew snapped out, he made the honor roll

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
All my niggas from the Chi
That's my family, dog
Now my niggas from Paris
That's my family, dog
Feel like one day
You'll understand me, dog
You can still love your man
And be manly, dog

[Verse 3 - Twista]
Twista!
Comin' at 'em, I'mma let it bang
Nothin' over family, it be the man in me to say it
And display it and I weigh it over everythang
I'mma be the one to tell 'em in a minute if you ever get a
Chance that you you better go and hug 'em
Love 'em, better say with the opportunity when it
Come, I don't wanna put nothin' above 'em
Fussin', it will never get you nowhere with 'em
You don't wanna listen,  you will never get to see 'em
If a man wanna follow the plan of not
Takin' care of the family, I don't wanna be him
Me, I'm in another category and I got a story
?that are? followin' and we shall be
The ones knowin' what's important
When they say MJ, Twista, GLC:
Family...

[Chorus]
