[Verse 1: Relay]
Blowing that green like landscape
Better break fast, no pancakes
Squad on the rise and we live all the time
Now we trynna get a deal like handshakes
Ridin' round to the Chi-town
Yeah we bringing that iller noise
Put in work and we still employed
Got the vibes, and we fill the void

[Verse 2: James Major]
Making these moves and we all here
Get to the green like lawn care
Think it's your time? It's the wrong year
Better step back like Paul Pierce
All net, collecting challenges
All bets, yall some ameturers
Far fetched, in the booth I'm like Clark Kent
Making moves, getting these checks

[Hook: GLC]
Motivated, elevated, the culture made it
Motivated, elevated, the culture made it
Motivated, elevated, the culture made it
I'm blowing on that green like I'm so Jamaican
I'm blowing on that green like I'm so Jamaican
I'm blowing on that green like I'm so Jamaican
I'm blowing on that green like I'm so Jamaican
I'm blowing on that green like I'm so Jamaican

[Verse 3: Mic Anthony]
I ain't ever been an underdog, meaning I ain't never been under yall
Lot of bitch niggas wearing wonder bras, threw a lot of house parties never come to yall's
Cause you ain't got the ratio
Girls don't give felatio
Couple rap niggas really hate me though but it's only cause they've never been paid for shows
And I ain't got shit to do with that
I ain't ever tell their crew to rap
Niggas think it's all about shoes and hats
But they cap never really paid their dues to rap
But we moving, carry on
I don't even fly with the carry on
Really don't matter what "Air" we on
Hit a swish like the 06 Marion

[Hook: GLC]
Motivated, elevated, the culture made it
Motivated, elevated, the culture made it
Motivated, elevated, the culture made it
I'm blowing on that green like I'm so Jamaican
I'm blowing on that green like I'm so Jamaican
I'm blowing on that green like I'm so Jamaican
I'm blowing on that green like I'm so Jamaican
I'm blowing on that green like I'm so Jamaican

[Verse 4: GLC]
Motivated, elevated, the culture made it
I'm blowing on that green like I'm so Jamaican
It came from a dream now it's cultivated
I'd rather be overpaid than overrated
She came in some jeans now she fucking naked
The Ism and these lames there is no relation
She tired of these games, join the congregation
Temptation, ups and downs, the paper chasing
The coin, trynna catch it like a dream catcher
Anointed, while these goofys seem desperate
Hatin' on my game like Russel Westbrook
Execution, retribution , fucked up your best look
I'm dressed in all black like Beijing
Ya lady living single like Regine
That's what she said to a player
I told her drive slow but she sped to a player. Ism!
