[Chorus: GLC]
I told my mella, that this right here is life or death
This is gangsta shit, yeah you hear me nigga?
I told my mella, that this right here is life or death
This is gangsta shit, yeah you hear me nigga?

[Verse 1: GLC]
I miss Ms. West, and I miss my momma
Feel like Tom Cruise, in the "Days of Thunder"
After the coffee glass, a playa crash
Will I ever get to see him laugh? A playa wonder
I got they blessings, I'm in zone come-up
Kind of angel hear my questions as I flame my blunt up
Or should I save my inner thoughts?
Took it all and put up everything that's in the vault
Thanks for looking out, when I didn't get caught
Did crooked things, to compliment my walk
Have you ever seen a friend layin' up in chalk?
This is gangsta shit, at least that's what we thought
Now everybody shootin', but as kids we fought
What the older hustlers bought, that is what we copped
Now the shawties bein' us, and we at fault
Cause we showed them the same bullshit that sent us off

[Chorus: GLC]
I told my mella, that this right here is life or death
This is gangsta shit, yeah you hear me nigga?
I told my mella, that this right here is life or death
This is gangsta shit, yeah you hear me nigga?

[Verse 2: GLC]
Why worry about, making seven figures?
Cause when you die, man, they say that you can't take it with you
Try tellin' that, to the Kennedys, and the Rockefellers, make paper for centuries
Why you think this street life temptin' me?
I gotta pay this warranty, and extension fee
Man I stay up in the fresh shit
Instead, I shoulda make some investments
Now I'm back out here hustlin', hopin' I can get some bread once again
Down, down, down, that's what I found, that it all comes tumblin'
I told my mella, that this right here is life or death
This can detour a G, from takin' righteous steps
But he ain't hit me back, I guess he ain't care
Turned his back up on a playa like I wasn't there
Like I wasn't there? Yeah, you hear me nigga
I'm in the gym gettin' cut up like an action figure
Honors' society, label me an active member
Six-feet deep in thoughts, nothin' will distract this pimpin'

[Chorus/Outro: GLC]
I told my mella, that this right here is life or death
This is gangsta shit, yeah you hear me nigga?
I told my mella, that this right here is life or death
This is gangsta shit, yeah you hear me nigga?
I told my mella, that this right here is life or death
This is gangsta shit, yeah you hear me nigga?
I told my mella, that this right here is life or death
This is gangsta shit, yeah you hear me nigga?
