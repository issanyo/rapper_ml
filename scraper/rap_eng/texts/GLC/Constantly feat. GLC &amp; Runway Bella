[Verse 1: Weasel Sims]
I Smoke a eighth/and dope my face
Toke away /each hope and pray
Think I might need locs today
Eyes so low/I'm riding slow-2
My vibe is cold /bitch plz don't kill it
Got Mind control/sleep on the ceiling
I grind 4 doe/ gotta feed my children
I'm close to great/ I know its fate-4
I'm constantly constantly
Rolling up dat broccoli
Pouring up cups properly
No We don't fuck wit dat garbage weed 6
Dem trash bags/ get so laughed at
My bitch be like where dem grams at-7
She roll up and I smash that
Like cam/ ho throw dat ass back-8
My last pack/ was a gas pack
Palms stay  itching/ for dat fast scratch-9
Kush numbers up and down like Nasdaq
I Get pounds first no hash tag-10
And sell  big boys daddy fat sax
I outlast other outkast-11
Since  the p's going fa the 3 stacks
Niggas greet me like where the weed at-12


[Hook: Cold Hard of Crucial Conflict]
Constantly, constantly, constantly smokin weed
Constantly, constantly, constantly smokin weed
Constantly, constantly, constantly smokin weed
Constantly, constantly, constantly smokin weed

Constantly, constantly, constantly smokin weed
Constantly, constantly, constantly smokin weed
Constantly, constantly, constantly smokin weed
Constantly, constantly, constantly smokin weed

[Verse 2:  Runway Bella]

I'm too high for giving a fuck bout what these haters say/
Person of interest, I'm the topic of discussions lately/
But that's below me bitch I'm spittin like a G.O.A.T be/
& they cannot overthrow me like lebron cannot beat Kobe/
I tell weasel pass the stogie these bitches finna blow me/

& imma beast so rippin beats it's like my feast, and you look weak/
Think it's best for you to change up, xscuse as I blAze up/

[Verse 3: GLC]

I'm constantly smoking that good
I'm often misunderstood
I'm from the chi
Where to survive
You take something or joog
I don't wanna do it
I stop it if I could
If a opp run up on me
Ima drop him in the mud
Genocide got me disturbed
Do tryta take what I earned
Why you think I been tweakin
Why you think I'm smoking bud
Why you think I'm out here in it
Spreadin ism what I invented
Getting head worship
Outer drive
Windows tented
You should try it
I recommend it
Get inspired
By the ism
See the skyline
Blowing good getting head
Baptism
I'm high like Jehovah
Shout out to my grower
We taking over
Got that Blue dream that Grover
