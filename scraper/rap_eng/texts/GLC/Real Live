[Intro - Bun B - talking] (*echo*)
Bitch don't play, for real
It's P.I., no bullshit, back up off me
I'm so serious about this
I'm so serious about this
Move around bitch, if you ain't down, move around bitch
Church on the move

[Verse 1 - Bun B]
Say bitch you fuckin with a boss (boss)
Trill O.G. that didn't come to take a loss (take a loss)
I paid the cost to be who I are (are)
And they know it when they see me ridin my car (car)
Candy, with the 'dro inside a big jar (jar)
I'm about to roll that motherfucker in a cigar (cigar)
And when the swisha sweet is hit, a be careful (why?)
That smoke'll have you coughin all your shit up (all your shit up)
I'm in my everyday get up (what?)
Black T, Levis, Jordans and them diamonds that stay lit up (that stay lit up)
You wanna be like Bun B, then step yo' fit up
Nigga this is Player's School, pay attention, sit up (nigga sit up)
'Cause big daddy's on the block (block)
Smokin private stock and his bitch is sellin cock (cock)
Hit the block, count the cash, get the G's, get the dough
And if you never did this shit before (shit), you can hit the do' (hit the do')

[Chorus - Bun B] - 2X
I need a real live ho (live ho)
That'll pick it up and drop it to the flo' (to the flo')
Fo' sho', now bust it open, let me see it
If you're lookin for a man ho, you know I can't be it (can't be it)

[Verse 2 - The Gator Main]
Okay, Gator, Main, nigga
I-I-I need a real live bitch (yeah)
To get out on that block until her daddy get rich (uh)
Now come and let a nigga put you on my gift list
This Rap-a-Lot bitch, grab a shovel, dig this (dig this)
Broke bitch, get a hustle, flip this (yeah)
If you don't like it, you can raise like a lift kit (a lift kit)
Little bitty boy, I was lifted
Off of kush smoke, seventh grade, must've missed it (missed it)
I start blowin up like some Bisquick
Fish stick ass nigga, plex, it was dismissed
My name be on top of nigga's hit list
Better yet my name be on top of a nigga's wish list (wish list)
Canary diamonds lookin like a piss test
Shorty wanna be with me, she better be a rich bitch (rich bitch)
Or she better be a dime don diva
When I'm down in the H-Town fuckin around with Bun Beeder, nigga

[Chorus] - 2X

[Break - GLC - talking]
Know the ism will continue to rotate mayne, you know what I'm talkin 'bout?
Non-pimpin wouldn't be prudent, you know what I'm talkin 'bout?
Learn a lot from the teacher and the student man
It's GLC with my mentor Bun

[GLC talking behind Break] - 4X
Everywhere I go, hold up, pimpin is respected

[Verse 3 - GLC]
Everywhere I go, hold up, pimpin is respected
Hoes keep a player chose, honor and accept it
Astonishin collective, my ism is effective
Wake up to some pressed clothes, pussy and some breakfast
Pimpin is a threshold, physically neglected
Women call my phone and plea for GLC to smash this
Tryin to check on me and see what they could come and help with
Yeezy's and some LIG's they wasn't on the shelf bitch
Just because your man be wearin that, what is that some velvet?
He at least intriguin, so I call him Robert Redford
Get an A for effort
That's when situations always lead to somethin desperate
I'm at another airport
Church is on the move, ooh, let me be your shepherd
The mackin Moses I was on it, I was caught up in the moment, mackin moment of atonement
Askin me to be your man, when you know the answer no, bitch (hell nah)

[Chorus] - 4X
