[Intro]
I got my drink in my hand
I’m feeling gone
But I ain’t even on yet
You know what I’m sayin’?
I just don’t did this shawty
Our hood rotatin’ through these windows
City streets, baby
Check it out

[Verse 1]
Trips to Tijuana, smoking ganja with [?]
To eliminate the haters upon us
But nigga they honor
Introduced her to that Gucci and Prada
Had it way before the boot leggers got it
A sick SS from a [?]
These girls love me more than they love their father
Game tight like a virgin Madonna
Ever since I can remember I been poppin’ my colors
Interlink incontinental when their [?]
That shit I take it in rooms that remind us
Girls wanna get me like Ivana
Tryna get my grill like [?]
‘Cause Mr. GLC is just a G, own his dollars
Flicking on you pimpin’ and pustules
Ain’t no need to get hostile
Keep everything airy, like you a [?]
Ten years from now they be diggin’ your fossils
But fucking with the king like Mufasa
Nigga I got ya

[Hook]
I’m in the strip club, spendin’ nothing but hundreds
Swappin’ right past the law, close [?] marijuana bud
Drunk than a motherfucker, I ain’t even on yet
Drunk than a motherfucker, and I ain’t even on yet
Everywhere I go they say “Boy you know you wanted”
‘Cause I’m [?] got hoes in the [?]
Drunk than a motherfucker, I ain’t even on yet
Drunk than a motherfucker, and I ain’t even on yet

[Verse 2]
All the cold hoes begin where we begin
[?], smokin’ them out, provokin’ ‘em all
They close, they rollin’ with the G, Double-O, D, oh, he cold
And this ain’t nothing about, the word got sold
A few dros, a few Os, blow like a bugle
Fuck what you heard, shawty I’m the nigga to know
Keep your mouth closed ‘bout me, yes my Malibu, oh
Screw, two tone crown, smokin’ on that homegrown
Bad bitch from out West, ass like Hongkong
Bad bitch from out South, drinkin’ on that Patron
All I wanna do is get ‘em home, and out that thong
Back when my colors was struggling
I confess I was fuckin’
The baddest bitches that niggas was coffin’
Hatin’, I wasn’t, I was doin’ it the plain way
As in imagine [?], don’t lay awake, hey

[Hook]
I’m in the strip club, spendin’ nothing but hundreds
Swappin’ right past the law, close [?] marijuana bud
Drunk than a motherfucker, I ain’t even on yet
Drunk than a motherfucker, and I ain’t even on yet
Everywhere I go they say “Boy you know you wanted”
‘Cause I’m [?] got hoes [?]
Drunk than a motherfucker, I ain’t even on yet
Drunk than a motherfucker, and I ain’t even on yet
