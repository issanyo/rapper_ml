Let me get my theme music (x2)
'Aye, Let me get my theme music (x2)

[Hook: T-Pain] + (Kanye West)
Baby, just forget everything that you know
Let's take it all the way back to hello
They say you livin' like you died before
I got a place that only I can go
Let me take you to flight school
(We'll learn to fly)
Let me take you to flight school
(Above all the lights)
You've never been so high, kiss the ground goodbye
And you say, damn baby how did you get that fly?
Flight school

[Verse 1: GLC]
I got the airplane passes, the aviator glasses
She be lookin fly like aviator classes
So classy, Jacqueline Onassis
Used to sneak and move like Ali, Cassius
Massive, like Kennedy's assassin
We was killin' time like clocks in the casket
Perhaps its time to prevail
I'll show you Gotham City like I'm Christian Bale
I can be Barack and let you be Michelle
Miguel
Gizelle
Dress fresh as hell
Louis
Gucci
Ye in that pastel
Adore Dior, ride down Lake Shore
She felt the vibe, I had to make sure
She felt deprived livin like she died
Slide with a G, now she felt revived
In town for the night, she's somebody wifey
The Air Yeez', she never seen these
So the moment I might seize
I done come up out the coma of livin life's dreams
When you wake up in the morning you join the flight team

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
I got my superman power, my superman cape
These the last hours, but superman late
The clock is ticking, damn can you wait?
Man, will he come back and save the day?
Fly across the earth, put things in reverse
I wish this life was a movie I could just rehearse
Certain things I can't doctor, and you say I'm the worst
I ain't have enough patients, but I needed a nurse
That'll come by my bed late
See if my head ache
Then get my head straight
Then give my head, great
Every time I popped up like the VCR
I took your breath away, then we performed CPR
With all the cars, the clothes, the lights, the boats
I guess I was just trying to sow my royal oats
In the penthouse position
With penthouse bitches
See I Pimp'd My crib, so I must exhibit
Shit, these last years been a haze like Issac
So I close my eyes
Tighter than Asian eyes get
Realized I got the same wings angels fly with
Louis Vuitton feathers, now that some fly shit

[Hook]
