[Intro: Splacc &  DJ Mustard]
(On My Mama I'm On
S - P - L - A - C- C
Mustard on the beat hoe!

[Chorus: Splacc & Big Mike]
Money in the bank bankin' baseball shit
Off mackin' gettin' rich on these niggas doing know what (You know it)
Thousand to a million real quick
Now you niggas can't tell a nigga shit too loud when I blow up (You know it)
Nigga I'ma stunner and a stunter stuntin' on your squad
Everyday I treat it like a summer (I know it)
Nothin' to be fucked wit', played wit'
Take you out the game quick
I put that on my mother (You know it)

[Verse 1: Nef the Pharaoh]
Real bank nigga like to J.A
My niggas doin' murders off the pay lay
Name a legend in the V and niggas better mention me
They'll tell you Neffy spit like a A.K
I just signed a deal wit' E-40 nigga
Was just a kid wrappin' keys wit' the forty nigga
Now I hit the club and spend forty, hit the mall and spend forty
Shit I used to couldn't afford it nigga
Money on my mind like a headband
Fuckin' wit' my fetty you a dead man
Shoot in the chest watch his head split
Everyday I make a band and never played an instrument

[Chorus: Splacc & Big Mike]
Money in the bank bankin' baseball shit
Off mackin' gettin' rich on these niggas doing know what (You know it)
Thousand to a million real quick
Now you niggas can't tell a nigga shit too loud when I blow up (You know it)
Nigga I'ma stunner and a stunter stuntin' on your squad
Everyday I treat it like a summer (I know it)
Nothin' to be fucked wit', played wit'
Take you out the game quick
I put that on my mother (You know it)

[Verse 2: Splacc]
Cause ain't shit funny 'bout a broke joke
Oh no, not me, walkin' rubber no dope nigga
How you gon' eat wit' your mouth closed
Rise and grind raise the money up like a high note
Ain't no friend of me, stunt on enemies
Don't come to me, talkin' 'bout what you finna be
You might emulate, pass that swisher please, I won't let her breathe
Show no sympathy, ain't no sippin' me apparently
They all wanna be down when it go up
But if you ain't a day one don't show up
This the kinda dough that stack it don't fold up
And I'm the first off the pack when they hoe up

[Chorus: Splacc & Big Mike]
Money in the bank bankin' baseball shit
Off mackin' gettin' rich on these niggas doing know what (You know it)
Thousand to a million real quick
Now you niggas can't tell a nigga shit too loud when I blow up (You know it)
Nigga I'ma stunner and a stunter stuntin' on your squad
Everyday I treat it like a summer (I know it)
Nothin' to be fucked wit', played wit'
Take you out the game quick
I put that on my mother (You know it)

[Vese 3: Big Mike]
This money ain't a prize what I'm led by
Feel like a zombie how I'm walkin' with them dead guys
Slide through late night on the red eye
She pick me up in the beamer wit' her hair tied
And if it ain't broke then don't fix it
I still need my distance
Don't cross me like Christians
Your life or your image
Run trap life positions
No dope on the premises
Dodgin' the sentence
No talkin' no witnesses
My bitch is sensless
No feelings, no gaggin'
I go chase the cheque 'fore I unwrap a Magnum
Jump out like what's happenin'
Pumpin' my lap like a napkin
If I fuck she the baddest
On my money I'ma opportunist
Off my meds I'ma orthodontist
You hit the liquor then you called the jeweller
I hit your bitch and then I got the chopper

[Chorus: Splacc & Big Mike]
Money in the bank bankin' baseball shit
Off mackin' gettin' rich on these niggas doing know what (You know it)
Thousand to a million real quick
Now you niggas can't tell a nigga shit too loud when I blow up (You know it)
Nigga I'ma stunner and a stunter stuntin' on your squad
Everyday I treat it like a summer (I know it)
Nothin' to be fucked wit', played wit'
Take you out the game quick
I put that on my mother (You know it)
You know it
You know it
You know it
