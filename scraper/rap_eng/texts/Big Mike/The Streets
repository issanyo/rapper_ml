(Verse1: Thato)

The streets lay silent with so much to speak, here is one of their chapters; listen!  Thato ya Modimo once again, Big Mike on production.  The streets, the streets, the streets, the streets yo!  Bare feet roaming the dusty streets, destiny is calling.  Marching along to the heart beat, though we go weary don't accept defeat.  Wisdom is sacred water, nurture the seed; beautiful rare jew' mother of pearls.  First God's pride, the people's last hope.   People lost hope out on the streets a man lives on dope, poverty stricken, the thought makes a man stop talking and start thinking.  Burning in the melting pot we are all sinking in the belly of the beast.  Looking west bearly east.  Tales of the streets, the one you least expected when you least expect it, you have got to respect it kid, the streets yo!  See the streets can make a man and the streets can destroy a man.  That's how it is!  Out here on these streets some dreams deafur, some dreams come true, which one is yours?  Sorrow painted my past and I hope some day it will all disappear(repeat 3), open class room, picture is in the dark room; future is dark doom, no degree post graduate from the university of life, taught by the corners graduated with honors no matter how it be I am going to get my ph. d from these streets, the streets yo!
