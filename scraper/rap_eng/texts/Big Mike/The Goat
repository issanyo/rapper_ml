Hook

Ahh that’s my brother mane
We don’t give a **** mane
We just poppin champagne
The world is not my judge mane
Got the game hogtied
G raw in the frog eyes
She think I’m the goat yeah
I say I guess so yeah

Ahh that’s my brother mane
We don’t give a **** mane
We just poppin champagne
The world is not my judge mane
Got the game hogtied

First verse

My plug got pure coke oh
30 bands in the loui tote oh
550 on 24s yeah
Backseat bad **** only
Won’t catch me wearing phoney
My **** on powder and she boney
Smoke moon rocks when She lonely
Grabbing at that **** when she on me
She same I’m the goat
Running butt naked on my boat
Whippen up that dope
Crack float like ivory soap
60 bands up for a show
9 inches all her throat
Feel in your stomach can you cope
Swimming in that *****
No rope
Cuban links bustin on my neck
Woke up rich to a check
Now old hoes recollect
But she can’t get this dick
Unless my niggas can choo choo
Whole gang yeah we foo foo
Spray yo whole city with the tommy gun
Knock off you quick
You and yo honey bun

Second verse

Me and my bruddah
From another mother
Gettin baked
In the A8
**** wanna chase
Give us face
Mutha **** a case
We like tay k
On a race
Coupe look like outer space
I am from another race
Extra terrestrial
Chopper lower your cholesterol
**** her in the *** with aster oil
I just bought a faster car
Run up on my window get posterized
Nuts hang low all in your eyes
Rata Tat tat
For you and your guys
She got good *****
All in them thighs
Paper still pilin
How high
Loud got me coughing
Mile high
Jumped out a coffin
So fly
Now my bitch got my name on her
Left thigh
And she trying to just give that
Left eye
Thanks for the accolades
And dope life
I run around town
Like I’m dope I
Run around town like I’m dope I
