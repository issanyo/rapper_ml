[Intro]
(“Fire”)
Nigga, you gotsta (“call the fire engine 'cause I’m flaming up your building”)
Nigga, you better (“call the fire, call the fire, call the fire engine 'cause I’m…”)
(“Fire”) (“Sending fire through my spine”)
(“Fire”) (“Sending fire through my, fire through my spine”)

[Verse 1: Big Mike]
Mark ass niggas, grab your shit because it’s on
And if you ain’t come to get down, then just get gone
Big Mike is up in the house and I’m about to bring it on
So nigga, bring it right or just get hung for bringing it wrong
Fool, this ain’t a dream, ‘cause if it was, I’d be the muthafuckin’ Sandman
Puttin’ niggas to sleep like so with my bare hands
The nigga from the hood causing wreck
Blacker than the lacquer that you’d find on your living room set
So nigga, don’t fuck around ‘cause I ain’t scratchable
I know you wants to fly my fuckin’ head but it ain’t detachable
So nigga, what is you askin’ fo’?
One to the dome, or should I just reload the chrome and blast some more?
Hittin’ every nigga up until it’s more dead
With the .44, laying ‘em down on their foreheads
So pack up your shit and retire, fool
‘Cause come June I’ma set your world on…

[Chorus]
(“Fire”)
(“Call the fire engine 'cause I’m flaming up your building”)
Nigga, you gotsta (“Fire”)
(“Call the fire, call the fire, call the fire engine 'cause I’m…”)
(“Sending fire through my spine, fire through my spine”)

[Verse 2: Mr. 3-2]
Oh no, I can’t be faded, I know you hoes hate it
‘Cause I peep out six shotswith the 9 millimeter nickel-plated
It can’t be debated, 1993, more murder killer upgraded
And muthafucka, it’s already been stated
For your ass to bring it on but you hesitated
My nigga, my loc, my homie, I can’t be imitated
Niggas be sick, all up on my dick, and player haters hate it
So get the gat, load the fuckin’ clip, nigga
‘Cause these busta ass niggas wanna trip, nigga
Bustin’ shots in a classic as we flip, nigga
Steady gettin’ fucked up, ‘bout to dip, nigga
It ain’t shit, nigga; so what the fuck is you talkin’ ‘bout?
Bumpin’ your gums, runnin’ off at the mouth
So pass the Swisher Sweet, so I could get higher
And watch your ass ‘cause I’ll fuck around and set your
(“Fire”) to your ass, bitch; to your ass, bitch; to your ass

[Chorus]
(“Call the fire engine 'cause I’m flaming up your building”)
(“Fire”)
(“Call the fire, call the fire, call the fire engine 'cause I’m…”)
(“Sending fire through my spine, fire through my spine”)

[Verse 3: Big Mike]
How can I kill a muthafuckin’ busta? Let me count the ways
Blast his muthafuckin’ ass for days and days and days and days
Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, lick a shot
Block-block, every muthafuckin’ busta gotsta drop
Word to the muthafuckin’ heater, man
Got a gang of niggas ready to bust a gang of caps when I see the man
Ooh, now what you hoes wanna do?
Ooh, run and get your punk ass crew
Cool, I got a gang of bullets too
Fool, one for him, one for you
Quick fast, to the ass, niggas be damned for dying slow
When I be letting the 22 plus 22 go
Boom, yeah, boom, come again, boom boom
Watch a muthafucka hit the floor again
Real, rugged, rough and original
Coming from the G-H-E-double T-O
No nuts, no glory, 1993, niggas be gettin’ smoked with that bullshit
In case you didn’t know, hoe
So if you plan to come down, they call me sire
Yeah, ‘cause I’ma set your world on…

[Chorus]
(“Fire”) Yeah
(“Call the fire engine 'cause I’m flaming up your building”)
Come on (“Fire”) come on
(“Call the fire, call the fire, call the fire engine 'cause I’m…”)
(“Sending fire through my spine, fire through my spine”)
Come on (“Sending fire through my spine, fire through my spine”)
Conflict’s in this muthafucka, y’all
(“Sending fire through my spine, fire through my spine”)
Big muthafuckin’ Mike and 3-muthafuckin’-2, yeah
(“Sending fire through my spine, fire through my spine”)
Pee-Wee on the muthafuckin’ boards, bringing that noise for y’all ass
(“Sending fire through my spine, fire through my spine”)
The Southern way, no other way, fuck what another say
(“Sending fire through my spine, fire through my spine”)
