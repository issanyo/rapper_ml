Trippy stangs, business on my brain
Perfect in my lane, I woke up early in the, early in the game
Different lanes, but it's all the same
Just the other day, I woke up early in the, early in the game
Then I floated off, then I hit the weed, then I drop that top, disregard that speed
That's a pricey watch, now I rolled up my sleeves
You nigga's sleeping, but I woke up early in the game

Jewelry so froze, I'll be on that no do's
Knock left, grand respect, super skinny, low pro's
Had to hop up on my ass and chase it
Now success I'm bout to grab, I can taste it
Throw that luggage overboard, them nigga's dead weight
Celebrate your new beginning pop some champagne
And never let them fuckers pull you back in
She out of pockets as the hoeâ€™s only a back in
Liquor pourin, kitty purrin, know she trynna creep
And cocaine niggas be the hottest on the streets
Pull up in a Viper on them ghetto corners
This shit here be dedicated to better mornings

That's a pricey watch, now I rolled up my sleeve
You nigga's sleeping, but I woke up early in the game

My wrist is chunky, that coupe is soupy
My pinky Disney, she call it Goofy
Taylor Gang, Coke Boyz, this my call of duty
Got 94 versace frames and a baby coogi
I got the block, ain't pay you niggas no man
Now a nigga cleaned up, I look good, don't I?
Two and a few, me and chinx the same
First thing we got in common never speak a name
That's Taylor Gang, Coke Boyz
You hear dem chains, you ain't making no noise
That's off with your top, like the roof gone
Stepping out on these niggas, put my shoes on
