When we show up,we pull up,sit up or get hit up/
Envious cuz they can't get up/
Boy we no rookies,No Cookie,don't know what u took o' me/
Used to be grounded now look at me
See just how crisp my slack crease get?/what's the streets'll get?Blow out yo speakers wit? Yo we Etheric
Forever Grindin- Forever we Shinin'- Forever Timin'-Forever we climbin'
HOOK- Meditate/ Til I Levitate/ I could Elevate or Devastate 3X
I Meditate/Til I Levitate/ Then I Detonate- Let's Go!!
VERSE 1-Tre'mendous
Somewhere off in that deep south/
Where the hoes stroll and thot's got the deep mouth/
Where the hustla's grind just to reap clout/
Bleed hand to hand til the stake outs creep out
Goal is to stack a few racks fo' the weeks out

Sounds far-fetched but it's non-fiction ain't it?/
I'm Yung Trizzay Get'em,I say fuck yo system,You don't know who is him?
Than Bitch get Acquainted!

Speak on my Ism,yo bottom trick fainted/
My colorful Prism go hard in the Paint it-
Ain't hard to tell I inhale and excel/
The Mic I contact and attract clientele/

Hataz tune in for the fail/
Tell a fuck boy hold his breath 'til his face turn pale/
Lame ass Sucka trying to sniff my trail/
Flunky tryin' to hold on to my coattail-

Oh well,Yo fail/ Boi I'm doin' so well/ Hotel- DEREK!
'Dro Smell,and snow sales/Keep me stackin mo' mail/ so go tell- PARROT!

Got where I'm at off of merit/
So issue me my Collard Greens and Karat's/
Candy Yams and my Cornbread, then I'm Going fed!
Hold yo head, young Boy!

CHORUS- They envious cause they can't get off the ground/ Envious cause they can't get up/ We used to be Earth bound but look at us now!/ Used to be grounded but look at us CLIMBIN'! /Whippin that Whippa around-SHININ'!/ All of 'em eyein' us down- TIMIN'/ Could'nt be better than now- GRINDIN'! Perfectly so perfectly I

VERSE 2- Big Mike
Teleport 50's and 100's bruh/
Illuminate on 'em a shinin star/
Levitate on 'em Main see me soar/
Devil is hurtin and lookin' sore

I spit what they ridin' to in cars/
Butter maku wit that Caviar/
So familiar they wanna know who we are/
OG ain't no way no superstar/
Nothin about what I say is law

Christ is King and you should know I'm not-
Givin' the truth like it ain't a prob/
Fully equip I'm completing the job

Levitatin' on 'em, like I'm sent from God Only-
Art all one me....
These hataz hungry I hear 'em comin/
Wanna take food from my kid and Woman

Sprinklin holy water from buckets
With the intent that they owe me somethin
Up in they Biddy like it ain't nothing/
Spiting that Monkey style when I'm drunken

2015 and they still stuntin/
Hi-Teck security push the button/
I'm givin thanks over Leg o' Mutton/
Bro not too long ago I was strugglin

In it-Tryna get it-Stomach hurtin, come on with it, come on with it/
Either get it-Or forget it-DIG IT?

Spitin' it with the hottest of 'em/
Cookin that '4 with they microwave oven/
No they ain't real,just cause they rappin/
90 percent of the time they just cappin-
While I-
