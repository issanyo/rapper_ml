[Intro]
Yeah, like that, come on, come on, come on
Smoke ‘em and choke ‘em like the muthafuckin’ Peterman
1, 2, 3, uh You ain’t know?
(“Smoke ‘em then choke ‘em like the muthafuckin’ Peter Man”)
(“Smoke ‘em then choke ‘em like the muthafuckin’ Peter Man”)
(“Smoke ‘em then choke ‘em like the muthafuckin’ Peter Man”)
(“Now they got the flashlight, looking for Big Mike”)

[Verse 1]
Ah yeah, the Peterman’s back in the thick of shit
Getting down for mine, taking care of business, bitch
Y’all remember me, the nigga who step out the house at 10 o’clock
Fired a couple of shots and shook up the whole block
Well now I’m back, and muthafuckas wanna flex
I let ‘em flex ‘cause I’m known for giving two to the chest
Now there’s a lot of down niggas that know of me
But on the other hand, there’s a few that ain’t sure of me
So I’ma take of my business, right?
And let them niggas know that the Peterman is in this
Since I’ve been away some wanna say I ain’t able
I played the game long enough, it’s time to take the money off the table
And put an end to all that bullshit singin’
Because I’m true to the muthafuckin’ game that I’m playin’
See, it’s a job, not a muthafuckin’ hobby
You hoes don’t know me, you better ask somebody, and I’m…

[Chorus]
(“Smoke ‘em then choke ‘em like the muthafuckin’ Peter Man”)
(“Smoke ‘em then choke ‘em like the muthafuckin’ Peter Man”)
(“Smoke ‘em then choke ‘em like the muthafuckin’ Peter Man”)
(“Now they got the flashlight, looking for Big Mike”)
You ain’t know
(“Smoke ‘em then choke ‘em like the muthafuckin’ Peter Man”)
(“Smoke ‘em then choke ‘em like the muthafuckin’ Peter Man”)
(“Smoke ‘em then choke ‘em like the muthafuckin’ Peter Man”)
(“Now they got the flashlight, looking for Big Mike”)

[Verse 2]
Bang bang, niggas fell down when they ran up
1993, jack move, get your hands up
Niggas fall to the wayside tryna play fly
Fuck around me, can wave your family bye-bye
Had to kill a copper for some shit he tried to do me
Steady making money ‘cause the dope game ain’t new to me
Steady stacking paper with my niggas and we all in
And there ain’t no stoppin’ this playa from New Orleans
Ninth Ward, always hard, nigga never pulled my card
Fuck around me, they’ll find your ass lying in the morgue
Laid out, niggas got played out, opposition faded out
Bitches wanna know how I made it out
So I just plaly that pimp role on ‘em
Be making ‘em thinking I’m lovin’ ‘em
When I just really be wantin’ to bone ‘em
And their daddies can’t understand, yeah
‘Cause ain’t nann layin’ more dick than the Peterman

[Chorus]
(“Smoke ‘em then choke ‘em like the muthafuckin’ Peter Man”)
(“Smoke ‘em then choke ‘em like the muthafuckin’ Peter Man”)
(“Smoke ‘em then choke ‘em like the muthafuckin’ Peter Man”)
(“Now they got the flashlight, looking for Big Mike”)
(“Smoke ‘em then choke ‘em like the muthafuckin’ Peter Man”)
(“Smoke ‘em then choke ‘em like the muthafuckin’ Peter Man”)
(“Smoke ‘em then choke ‘em like the muthafuckin’ Peter Man”)
(“Now they got the flashlight, looking for Big Mike”)

[Verse 3]
1, 2, 1, 2, muthafuckas, here I go again
Run and tell a fuckin’ friend, Big Mike’s on the hunt again
Huntin’ niggas, gunnin’ niggas, hittin’ niggas, splittin’ niggas
Grabbin’ niggas, stabbin’ niggas, chokin’ niggas, smokin’ niggas
Taking ‘em to the muthafuckin’ max
Niggas get back when I drop this muthafuckin’ axe
Dead across the back of a hoe
Niggas catch a blow, bitches get stitches and robbed of their riches
‘Cause I be the nigga you never seen
Worse than a fuckin’ bad dream and deadlier than a guillotine
Choppin’ muthafuckas in pieces
Dumpin’ their bodies in rivers and watch it wash up on beaches
I’m from that Nine, where niggas don’t mind dying
Always packin’ iron, fool, I ain’t lyin’
So when you see them niggas ru-ru-runnin’
Look who’s co-comin’ through, the muthafuckin’ Peterman

[Chorus]
(“Smoke ‘em then choke ‘em like the muthafuckin’ Peter Man”)
(“Smoke ‘em then choke ‘em like the muthafuckin’ Peter Man”)
Yeah, fool, I told you once before, ha ha ha
(“Smoke ‘em then choke ‘em like the muthafuckin’ Peter Man”)
(“Now they got the flashlight, looking for Big Mike”)
(“Smoke ‘em then choke ‘em like the muthafuckin’ Peter Man”)
(“Smoke ‘em then choke ‘em like the muthafuckin’ Peter Man”)
(“Smoke ‘em then choke ‘em like the muthafuckin’ Peter Man”)
(“Now they got the flashlight, looking for Big Mike”)

[Outro]
Yeah, right back up on your ass, the Southern way, no other way
Fuck what another say, fool—that’s my motto
Yeah, that new thang, new slang, watch out for the dame
It’s like that, y’all (It’s like that y’all, and ya don’t stop)
