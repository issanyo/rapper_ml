[Verse 1: Walker M]
I'm just another Rainy City rapper wishing you good morning
My eyes to the sky and my idols in California
Warning, there's more in store you can't get rid of me
It's chilly but I'm hot, believe it or not, Ripley
Simply put, you asked for it, matter of fact tacked the shit
Up in your tackle box and went out fishing for compliments
And confidence is key, luckily I rap incredibly
Wanna be big, but stay lowkey like Thor's enemy
I hit you like a hammer with my quote and quote humility
I used to pay for gigs and now the venues writing checks to me
Intent to recompense the gifts that I've been given
Cause music is my life and I just breathe to make a living
So when I die, I want you all to know me as the guy
Who let prophesizing Mayans try and drive his white suburban life
And asking why he'd take me for a ride, I took a knife
And showed his approximate apocalypse an Aztec sacrifice
Yeah, and that was nice, rhyming while I'm eating rice
And chowing down on chow mein cause I'm half-Asian and half-white
Little wop, mobster-like, marveling at Robin's tights
Dropping cops, quickly robbing fobs of their Miranda rights
Mobbing on 'em, non stopping, spitting fire tryna light?
Sloppy hand job, jocking zombie-like, I lost my mind
Got a mic, so I tell it how it is
And how we're more than just a couple over-privileged white kids
North of Oregon, whoring out our gifts to so-and-so again
With lips licked, engrossed in studios to make recordings in
'Course I'm out of style, rocking fitteds and not snaps
And you're hopping bandwagon, kangarooing in a Yankees cap
Back to where I started at, Kangley and a Road of Wax
East Hill chilling on the rail tracks
Bumping KMAC, DnS Mixtape I got dat
Piff-puffing the magic dragon, you can ask me all about that

[Break]
You can ask me all about that
You can ask me all about that
You can ask me all about that
You can ask me all about that

[Verse 2: Walker M]
I get high and waisted like a hipster's best pair of pants
Music in my heart ever since my life began
Anne Frankly I've been hiding out, hoping for a chance to drop a track
And get my name well established around the world and back
And whack rappers boring me, I got the authority
To call them all bitches, the whole game is a sorority
That'll never change, cause it makes up who I am
I'm a slacker, cracking jokes like knuckles and cracker jack
I'm not religious, but I say that I'm a Catholic
Slacking, cash, stacks, racks, hash and ass my six sacraments
And rap is both the seventh and my ticket into heaven
Cause I kill these beats, confess my sins and then ask for repentance
I'm a white and yellow rapper, sorta like a Trojan
A rap surprise attack a Trojan horse of forced importance
California calls my name, and Seattle does the same
Cause the west coast is best coast and that'll never change

[Break]
And that'll never change
And that'll never change
And that'll never change
And that'll never change
