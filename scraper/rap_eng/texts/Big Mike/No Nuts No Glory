(Big Mike, how you livin?)

[ VERSE 1: Big Mike ]
I been sellin out the same dope house since the age of 16
Shufflin crack like cards to these burnt out dope fiends
Cookin rock after motherfuckin rock
Seein cop after motherfuckin cop on the block
Changin face after motherfuckin face
Watchin niggas catch dope case after dope case
Add it up and you'll find mo' niggas doin time in the pen
Cause he wouldn't snitch on his fuckin friend
And that same motherfucker that didn't go to jail
Wouldn't come and pay his homeboy's bail
But that's the way niggas do you
Caught a case for another nigga and he swear he never knew ya
12 months in the county, you done got out and found out
That your homie runs his own dope house
And he ain't gave you shit
Not even a funky-ass ounce to get on yo feet, that sheisty bitch
And he still calls you family
But I be damned if I be kin to a nigga who ain't payin me
Cause I ain't with that ho shit
So if you thinkin 'bout fuckin me, nigga, you better try some mo' shit
Cause I done paid my dues and like a fool in the process
Watch another nigga progress
Off the motherfuckin shit I did
But in the '90s, it's payback and I ain't takin no shorts, kid
Cause life is a bitch
And I ain't that nigga to be broke while makin another motherfucker rich
So wise up, nigga, get with the program
Cause in this dirty game you gotta wash your own hands
And I got a Tec-9, ready to take mine and what's for me
Ho, yeah, no nuts no glory

Now I done heard a nigga say they callin me the biggest bitch in Texas
Cause I'm bummin a ride when I should be drivin Lexus
But you know I gives a fuck about what niggas say
I handle mine by handlin shit my own way
I let niggas think it's cool
To fuck a nigga like me, but they don't know who they psychin fools
See, I stay low key
Lettin a nigga think he know me, but he really don't know me, G
Claimin that we friends
When my little girl is ridin the bus and his little girl is ridin a fuckin Benz
Who's your friend, ask yourself that shit
The only friend I got is my fuckin pistol grip
Filthy rich, I know you love it
I done made yo ass fat and you still talkin 'bout 25 off a hundred
Be real, that shit went out in '86
I'm down with the Geto Boys but my mind ain't playin tricks, bitch
Still refuse to give me mine? Cool
Nigga be that way and I'mma handle my business, fool
Just like my nigga Snoop Dogg told me
You gotta get down for your shit while you can, homie
And you's about to get yo ass lit up
Cause the fuckin aim proper and I ain't the nigga that's catchin the nut
Payback is a motherfucker, payback is a bitch
But payback is a must when I ain't the nigga that's gettin rich
Cause life ain't but one big chance
And unlike these other motherfuckers I ain't scared to touch yo bitch ass
Cause if you believe in fuckin niggas, you's a ho
And the Peter Man can't tolerate hoes, so you gots to go
Mr. Big Man, Mr. Big Nuts
Got everybody thinkin you's the shit
But really I'm the motherfuckin one
So I'm about to grab my shit off the self
And go on a mission, one nigga gettin busy by his damn self
So keep on thinkin you fuckin me
But while you thinkin I be pullin your fuckin number, G
Cause I'm a nigga with no heart and no worry
Gettin down for mine, bitch, no nuts no glory
