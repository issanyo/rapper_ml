I got a thorn in my side and I wish someone would pull it
I'm thinking about giving this motherfucker a bullet
But I ain't going out like that
I got too much at stake
To let myself be brought down by these snakes
They fake
And everybody know it
Hell, they be tryin' they best not to show it
But it coming out like sweat from they pores
I sees 'em everywhere with these 5 dollar hoes
Callin' for a war but they don't want no trouble
If I really had my way I'd spank that ass on the double
These niggas mumble, Conversations with they partners
But, they best-a take vacations
Before the catch hot ones
They whereabouts, I always know
And little do they know I got niggas ready to blow up they homes
But I'm-a tell my niggas to freeze that
Ain't no need to go to jail or hell behind these fucking thieves, black
Fuck that (See these niggas ain't right, it's about time we all get hype)
We'll see 'em on the street when it's meant to be when the time is right
But until then, stay cool only time'll tell
When it's time to make these motherfuckers raise up and bail
Set sail
Get the fuck up off the block nigga
Or better yet, gimme what the fuck you got
I want everything
From the dope to G's, expensive clothes, elbows in vogues and Lexus keys

(chorus)
We sendin' letters to bitches who were about to get-get it
Sealed it with kisses and blew their brains when they read it
Let it
Be your first fuckin' lesson
Zero tolerance for niggas disrespecting leather connections...

Now I hear they got several niggas out to get me
Puttin' out hits G, but to me they talkin' shit, see
Cause they ain't holdin' a motherfuckin' thing
Neither him, his hood or his motherfucking gang
They let gunshots ring
Every day and every night
But they ain't hittin' shit, cause they ain't hittin' Mike
They try with all their might, but I watch 'em all fall, big or small
I'm-a fade 'em all, fool
Call me crazy but I don't give a damn
It's obvious to me, that they don't know who I am, cause see
Them payback niggas don't go for no losses
I do some wicked ass shit and watch niggas fall in coffins, often
So don't try and test the Black, my knock
I bust back into the motherfuckin' ??New Jack?? I stack
Every night and every day
And don't give a damn to what these hoe-ass niggas say

(chorus 2nd version)
We're sending letters to bitches who were about to get-get it
Sealed it with kisses and blew their brains when they read it
Let it
Be your first fucking lesson
Zero tolerance for disrespect leather connections
I'm exing
These motherfuckers out like wrong answers
Get a grip, I got a hold on your ass like cancer
Make 'em dance, I make niggas do gymnastics
Pull and try to cash this
Set 'em down in caskets, yeah

It's been a whole year and I still ain't fall down
My shit still circulate through y'all town
It's a small town but, compared to other cities
It really don't matter cause the situation's still shitty
Or will they get the motherfucking picture
And if I shoot and miss, then I'm-a have to get ya, hit ya
With something real, something harder to steal
Something serious nigga, that I know you'll feel, now
How many motherfuckers gonna fall when I come around
How many motherfuckers like y'all gonna hear the sound
I thunder on your motherfucking back
Like a whip when I flip
You'll hear that bitch crack your back
You bitch ass niggas don't want no static
I'll leave you feenin' like an addict when I work my magic
It's like voodoo
Coming from that swamp
I might do you
You'll get your ass stomped

(repeat 2nd chorus)
