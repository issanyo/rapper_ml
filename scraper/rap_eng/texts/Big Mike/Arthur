I'm still spitting on the mic I ordered on Amazon
But I got the game wrapped like boas and anacondas
I'm sharp as Excalibur, forged in Avalon
And compared to mine, your brain goes as slow as a grandma's Honda
My flow is candy Wonka bars, sweet and rich
Ask me if I'm keyed as shit and I'll likely try and plead the fifth
I need a bitch to tell me that we're finger lickin' good, not
KFC, but AFB is sizzlin' chicken bucket hot

I'm never one to go and commit party fouls
I stay McFly, straight out of Marty's house
Can I do it? Yes I Ken; like I was Barbie's spouse
Trying to get brain so I obtain a smarty's mouth
Your girl's the Joker, always smiling around me
I go hard, you as soft as Downy
We're not good buds like a poor kid's brownies
If you're looking for real, then it's a good thing you found me

"Pretty much everywhere, it's gonna be hot. Charlotte?"
"Man, I don't need a jacket."
"[laughs]"
"Thanks Arthur."

[Walker M]
They all say he's really fucking good at everything he fucking does
Writing 16's since before he fucking was
Since I've been getting views, I've been where the chicks are
That's right - I got a Woody while I'm building up a Buzz
Like Pixar, on that VHS
Bump me on surround sound like THX
I make that X a C, then I'm in ecstasy
And then I check to see if I can see the checks

[DC]
Got flow like the girl at Progressive
I don't give a shit like I got bad digestives
I go aggressive, like "Is his flow impressive?"
I say "No shit Sherlock, and Holmes, I'm no detective!"
You can try, but nobody is stopping me
Get money then I go, man, life is just Monopoly
Commonly copping Z's, then go smoke that broccoli
Your girl is a hoe, so I'm probably pushing her off of me

[Hook]
They all say the same thing when I'm at the spot
"Pretty much everywhere, it's gonna be hot"
All the hoes need to quit the racket
"[laughs] Man, I don't need a jacket!"
Thanks Arthur x8
