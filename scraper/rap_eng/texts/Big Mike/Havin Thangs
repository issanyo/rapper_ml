[ Hook: Pimp C ]
Fly hoes and chains and swangin thangs
Just another young nigga havin thangs, mayn

[ VERSE 1 ]
Time brings change and change comes with time
Throughout these years I learned to get down for mine
Had to do some crime with the attitude of not giving a fuck
Born with no luck, refused to stay stuck
I made the bucks, did what I had to, I did what I could
My rise to the top was no surprise cause I knew that I would
Make it, oh, the chance, I had to take it
Fake it never because that nigga was too clever
If there ever was a motherfucker down for his crown
It had to be me, the B-i-g M-i-k-e, straight gee
Come sun down, come sun up, gun up
For them niggas who wanna run up
Whatchamacallit came up short, that nigga done what?
Fool, this big black nigga don't go for no losses
I had to get rid of my runner, so I recruited more horses
Down with neighborhood bosses, I made a connection and rose
Later for elbows and Vogue's, I just kick back and stack rolls and hoes

[ VERSE 2 ]
Times are changing, I'm living my life in and out the door, black
Lounging here and there, somethin screamin in my ear
"Michael go back home," but I ain't really sure, black
I gots to get my shit together the right way, nigga, I know that
Coming up short swinging by the tail and
Thinking of a master plan, this nigga's bailing
Down the road, and I promised not to look back
At what I once had, what I have now, what I left, and what I once took, black
Shook that, now I'm in my own realm
Controlling shit, kicking it, never knew life could be so damn well
I got mine, everything fell in line
Time brought change and change came with time

[ VERSE 3 ]
Lock another nigga up, throw away the fucking key
That's the way they punish me, motherfuck society
I could spend a century in the penitentiary
It won't make a difference, gee, cause ain't nobody missing me
Round and round and round we go, a different day, a different face
Damn, I wish I could run away, I hate this motherfucking place
Too many goddamn rules, that's why I quit school
Giving me a crooked test, I ain't no damn fool
Can't walk out my house because they always in my face
And if I step out of place they wanna give me a case
Ain't no difference between society and the jailhouse
Everybody's locked up and wanna get the hell out
Just cause you ain't locked down you think you got it good
But you better think again cause the police
Are checking niggas in the neighborhood
Beating our ass down
Cause society is just like the pen, so get ready for the lockdown
Clock now while you can, man
Huh, cause it's all about havin' thangs
And I'mma get mine, fool
Time brought change and change came with time
