[Hook: Konan]
What goes up must come down
Ones everywhere, but what's a dollar to a pound?
Oh, bass turn up every time you turn around
I swear you must've been practicing when you're by yourself in your house
Cause you make it look so easy, so easy
Girl you make it look so easy, so easy
How you make it look so easy, so easy?
Girl you make it look so easy, so easy
How you make it look so easy?

[Verse 1: Konan]
She call me Mr, she wanna role play
Now turn around and make that rotate
I've got her dancing on the table
I think Charlie's missing an angel
Yeah, I told a friend to come and help me with it
Arse so fat, I took a selfie with it (behave!)
These other girls couldn't fill your shoes
Say you got it from your mum, you better bring her too

[Hook: Konan]
What goes up must come down
Ones everywhere, but what's a dollar to a pound?
Oh, bass turn up every time you turn around
I swear you must've been practicing when you're by yourself in your house
Cause you make it look so easy, so easy
Girl you make it look so easy, so easy
How you make it look so easy, so easy?
Girl you make it look so easy, so easy
How you make it look so easy?

[Verse 2: Krept]
Flick the left cheek, flick your right cheek
Tick tick, buss it open in them Nikes
And them tight jeans make me wanna fornicate
Police said freeze, must've saw the chain
Shit, the way she got that booty clapping
Shake it like you tryna win a booty pageant
Clap it, throw it in a circle, that's a free for all
I think that we should make a freak show

[Hook: Konan]
What goes up must come down
Ones everywhere, but what's a dollar to a pound?
Oh, bass turn up every time you turn around
I swear you must've been practicing when you're by yourself in your house
Cause you make it look so easy, so easy
Girl you make it look so easy, so easy
How you make it look so easy, so easy?
Girl you make it look so easy, so easy
How you make it look so easy?
