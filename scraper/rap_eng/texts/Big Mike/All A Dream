Erse 1 (Big mike)
What it be like patna, If you be like me you be high and shit/ thankin bout the payoff and how u gone be buying shit/fliping round town fly and shit. Na,no need to lie my Nig I seen em come and go/Bunch of fools hang in round the studio/beggin for people to hear em flow/mad at me could of got they shattered dreams left on the flow.But that's the way it goes in this rap game it ain't no play thang,play thang/M.C.'s been hustling for years trying to make this hear a permanent pay thang.Na you got these ear hustlers/fake Lil busts trying to swipe yo knot/They ce IP with they crooked game trying to get they name in lights and what not.No instead of trying to write what's hot/niggas steady trying to swipe yo spot/Trying to get to keep popping why they plot in to lie in ya lot.But my homie let me tell you that's how haters is they be trying trying to get paid off yo ideas/you thenput in work for years trying to get recognition for your peers.Platinum record sales and cheers,headlining and sold out shows/Bringing I'm bundles of doe at the back if the bus talking bout what they hitting for.Spitting at the finest hoes/slammin big mansion doors/bought your mama a crib in the country at the end of some big winding road/the idea of it all is just too cold...

Chorus:Can it be it's All A Dream,Everything ain't always what it seems/Can't have no fake ass niggas on yo team/All you playas know just what I mean...

Verse 2 (Tre'mendous)

It's a Cryin' shame,lames act like they ain't heard of buying game/
In the midst of snitches sporting wired frames,I'm trying to make the money mail cause im tired of fame-

I roll incognito smoke a sweet so,we can jam a little bit of screw cause the beats slow/
Chillin with the click looking for the freaks tho,chunk up the playa duece when we creepin 4-

Deep N' peepin for the laws we blow to stay mellow, 4 sho ride,never slip and slide,we can't slip and die, we got clips inside and we eqipt to ride, fo this rap shit and where the click resides

But it ain't bout that, plus I dont doubt that these niggas gone respect the set we bout black/
We just want the checks and no doubt the clout that I earned on the lyrics on the tracks I put out flat

With no shiesty shit in the game and the playa haterism,knowin I got the real flavaism/
With them under the table calls,nigga I quit ball cause of favortism

So boy, recognise the truest, in Northline nigga's have a hardtime trying to flip a nickel to a dime so its time that we do this fool

Talkin bout cash flippin,anybody interferin catch an ass whippin, mash dippin/
Gotta keep the cash hidden from the fakes and the jakes pullin fast tricks n'

Maintain prevail, pray for a smooth sail n',get a chance to bail when they try to intervene/
They seem to be trying to take me under ,wondered whem I was younger would I punder to the fate that appeared im my dreams to me?
Or could be its all a dream
