I put nitrous on a kid's stroller and roll it down a hill
Grab your white pants and Folger's and "accidentally" spill
Put Kool-Aid powder on your flowers, wait about an hour
And as the rain showers down to the ground your plants will be killed
Best believe your frown will be filled
I'm burning a forest down for every house that be build
It's so astounding a thrill to have a heart pounding with thrill
I'm relieving rap game pain like you're downing a pill, uh
Poor kids living in a poor city (thirsty)
I pour some water on the ground and make them plant look more pretty (curse me)
You better cake up with that makeup 'cause those pores look shitty
I give the wrong answers to kids and they end up scoring fifties
My good friend wanted headphones, he's the best guy
So I bought some at Best Buy and sent them to a deaf guy
Crazy? Nah, I just like to say I have a blessed mine
I'll kick a cop's ass before they can ever arrest mine

Nothing glitters when you're growing bitter and old
Act young or get grown

Yo, all that glitters is gold
Be dumb and never grow old
Yo, all that glitters is gold
Be dumb and never grow old

I was put on the earth to cause headaches and neck pains
It's been said that hell raise because of my birth
But it hardly marks a party 'til somebody gets hurt
In third grade, I left the bully's blood on the turf
And I done it with mirth, and I gun at the first chance to force the gimmick
As I aim Yo Mama jokes at orphaned children
I make all the gorgeous women follow portion limits
I tell dead baby jokes at abortion clinics
And of course I get it, I ain't no bumbling idiot
I'm just the chief executive at Monkey Business
There ain't no money in it, it's just some funny shit
I use big words, all the chicks love a cunning linguist
They be like "Jesus, isn't he really cool?"
As I push another paraplegic in a kiddy pool
And if humor is a global health hazard
I'll laugh at kids in Africa and go to hell after 'cause

[Hook]

Nothing glitters when you're growing bitter and old
Act young or get grown

Yo, all that glitters is gold
Be dumb and never grow old
Yo, all that glitters is gold
Be dumb and never grow old
Be dumb and never grow old

[Bridge]

Be dumb and never grow old
Be dumb and never grow old
Be dumb and never grow old
Be dumb and never grow old

[Hook]

Nothing glitters when you're growing bitter and old
Act young or get grown

Yo, all that glitters is gold
Be dumb and never grow old
Yo, all that glitters is gold
Be dumb and never grow old
Be dumb and never grow old
