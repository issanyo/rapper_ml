Look, it's ya girl Nicki Maraj
My nigga Ru Spits
Getcha... G's up

[Hook]
Where my niggas that's getting they G’s up
In the back and you rolling your trees up
Where my bitches that's getting they freeze up
And getting they tease up, just tell em to ease up
Where my niggas that's getting they G’s up
In the back and you rolling your trees up
Where my bitches that's getting they freeze up
And getting they tease up, just tell em to ease up

[Verse 1: Nicki  Minaj]
See I don’t know what they take me for
And I don’t know what they hate me for
I gets cake fo-sho
And I don’t know how to take it slow
I’m the type to get right, stay in the limelight
These broke niggas always re-ing up
Niggas see me in the beam now he speeding up
I’m like "Duke holler at me! When ya G’s is up"
Oh, that’s the Kanye piece? Throw your Jesus up
When I say I’m bout my guac, I don’t mean amole
Feel like I’m being watched, I don’t mean a rollie
I’m half past seven o' clock, all by my lonely
Spits got the dessie on cock, don't run up on me, blocka
Bitches getting mad, cause they know they can’t, stop her
Nickname should be TV, the way they, watch her
Run with a, shotter
Gotta be at least six feet to break me off, proper

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Nicki Minaj]
See, I don’t know what they take me for
And I don’t know what they hate me for
I gets cake fo-sho
And I don’t know how to take it slow
I’m the type to get right, stay in the limelight
I’m at the bar getting Rémy on rocks
I’m coming for these rap bitches if they ready or not
You know the girl, I already was hot
You tell 'em fuck a new bitch, I want a veteran spot
Look, it’s Nicki M. in the place so stay back
I stay around the white like I’m Pat Sajak
Plus I had my A-game up since 8-track
I’m Diddy with the flow, “Take that, take that”
My flow say ca-ching and my pockets say cheese
I ain’t got a bag but my wrist say freeze
Dick em, trick em, I know how to pick em
Beeeeert! Stick em, ha-ha-ha, stick 'em

[Bridge]
If you wanna me sweat me
Then baby let me
Tell you, I’m not like them other girls you've been with
Cause I know you think I’m sexy
You wanna sex me
Rolling with Ru Spits
We make hits
Where my chips, bitch?

[Verse 3: Ru Spits (Nicki Minaj)]
I don’t know what you chasing dog
Cause I ain't got patience for (nope, nope)
All these dudes that be hating ya’ll
Cause money we be taking more, getting cake for sure
Only think about making more
Grey Azzure, mink drag, let it scrape the floor
Don’t be mad when I take your broad
Rock stone, can’t trace the flaw
So I guess in a way, you could say I was made to ball
Act out and the K applaud
Me and Nicki gon’ pay the cost
You wanna play the boss, you gon' learn how to take a loss
Of course I’m back, kid still torch the track
I'm getting paper like Office Max
Branch house with the horse to match
Pink gems, and the cross attached, hit you then I toss the gat
So, G’s up, niggas get your B’s up
Chick act up, tell a hoe to ease up
In the back of the club, homie roll that weed up
If you wanna jump bad, a beat down’s the out come

[Hook]
