[ VERSE 1: Prode'je ]
Another soldier from the Central with the 80 in my pocket
A nigga's knocked it and I fucked him like socket
Cleared his fuckin ass, cause I never play the last place
So now he's walkin with the muthafuckin gas face
That's right, I'm burnin muthafuckas like a arsonist
I have you walkin like a crippled and retarted bitch
I never fuck around when I'm with a team of fuckin gangsters
Westcoast freestyle bangsters
Kickin a foot up in yo ass like Pele
And prosecute like the muthafuckin D.A
I'm rollin a small coupe drop through the hood of gees
And hittin the chips on the undercover p-i-g's
I'm givin a fuck about naythin, muthafucka Satan
Cause I'm the only nigga crematin
Fool, the Prod came out heartless
Gang related, don't be anohter nigga on my shitlist

[ Hook ]
I don't waste a minute, muthafuckas I be smokin
(I got another gang story to tell, peep)
Sometimes I walk around strapped, nigga

[ VERSE 2: Tre-Duce ]
Back up in the hood I thought you knew, oh punks, you didn't know
Though you got a grip you're gettin dropped like a sixty-fo'
I put my foot up in your ass so far
I'm leavin prints on your neckline, signed 'Mr. Bogart'
Another victim of society
Why did you lie to me?
So I gotta use my strap daily
And take you muthafuckas out
It coulda been prevented, but the niggas was sho' from the sto'
A.K.-47 ways to heaven
I took em for a 211
And left his ass with 187
Just a another nigga dead and gone
He fell victim to the chrome as I punched in the gold broam
I roll the streets with a murder rep
I'm known for kickin hoes and niggas' necks and causin istant death
Young niggas goin in and comin out winnin
The gang story that a nigga's tellin

[ Havoc The Mouthpiece ]
South Central L.A. is the gang capital of the world
Where niggas walk around strapped daily
And won't hesitate to smoke yo ass in a minute
Take it from the Mouthpiece
This is just another Gang Story

[ VERSE 3: Havikk The Rhimeson ]
Back up in the hood, oh yes, I'm back
I'm leavin your fuckin skull marinated in the heat as I creep
I'm stickin my shoe up in your ass so far
My shoestring will look like hemorrhoids as you're lyin in the fuckin morgue
I gives a fuck when I creep
I told you I was evil as a nigga when I'm lyin by the devil 'sleep
I let the slugs fly quick
The Tec-22 is in your ass like flies on shit
I'm from the dephts down below, the groundward
The graveyard, rockin you niggas, cause I'm that hard
Rhimeson casuin havoc for the underground
You fuck around, you lay around, and yo, you hang around
I'm puttin niggas on graveshift
The Glock-9 plays connect the dots off in your ass, bitch
The hardest nigga with a g slang
'94, here we go, muthafuckas, it's a g thang

[ VERSE 4: Big Mike ]
Just another muthafucka who got tore down
Came home and beat his ho down
Bust shots at the police and lost the showdown
Low down, but now his little brother's stuck on payback
Rollin through the hood, and them little niggas stay strapped
What can I say, black? B.G. is heartless
Usin one-time as targets, I warned you not to start this
Cause he's down with some down-ass niggas from around the way
It be that way, they got they nuts off fo' deep, and they down to play
Anything you hoes wanna do
(Well, bust a right at the light, come back and bomb that corner, fool)
Four young niggas ready to fuck your cap up
Left three niggas dead, and you thought they wouldn't act up?
Zip the sack up, and wipe the blood off of the flo'
Started some shit, and now they got everybody at each other's throats
Kinda fucked up, but that's the way it be
These niggas don't be playin on these muthafuckin streets
