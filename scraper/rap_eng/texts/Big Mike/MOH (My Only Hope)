(Vesrse1: Thato)

Ah - ah - ah! To serve, to love and have our hearts removed, open up and let charisma flow.  Shooting star, dark skies reflect in my glow. Black rose polluting your soul blowing white snow, Zulu said: fourth - coming attraction might not show.  We live fast and die slow, Jesus and Diablo, Biko and Dialo.  Robert Denerio scenario, remember blood diamonds from Sierra Leone?  Take a journey see how far we can go.  Foolish men cherish gold.  Mahatma Ghandi, my heart bleed kind of enigma.  I keep on keeping strong, my thoughts deep in a song.  Pain is as deep as a thorn, raised in the days of pyramid schemes, characters moulded by broken dreams.  Power of God, fire ignite: like days in the night scenes.  I am a flower of word on the mike my light gleams, many grow without a father in the motherland, we fear the devil more than we fear God.  Scared to show love to the brother - man huh!
