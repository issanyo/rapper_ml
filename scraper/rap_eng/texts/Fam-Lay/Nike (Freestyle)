[Intro: Fam-Lay] (DJ Cipha Sounds)

Yeah (Let's go!)
Traintago
Star Trak
Uh uh

[Verse 1]
It's Fam-Lay, cuz, straight from Huntersville
Damn, my folk now pronounce it Gunnaville
Told y'all before, if my bros do comin' here
[?] gone be shit but a bunch of blood in here
Six foot, sweatpants, cornrows, XL
Knives et cetera, don't make me wet ya
Uh, uh, uh, the west can't protect ya
I keptcha to stretch ya [?]
Now you know how I do, when I come through
When I come through, nigga the gun come, too
I'll cop the pump 1, 2, run upon you and take what I want from you
Just the way momma's only son do
[?] wanna some, they can come, get some, too
I'm publics enemy, two jugs of Hennessy
Living the life only thugs of Virginia see
Black bastard and all black masses
Wanna push us, smoke is no joke, I better stop laughing
Niggas rap about that and this
But the real truth about all of that is this, nigga
Never confuse that with this
'Cause that lil' nigga Fam-Lay [?]
Get your hustle for your chain and watch
And then I push you for your chain and watch, watch
Virginias killa, get realer on the [?] drug dealer, gorilla, on a four wheeler
Listen, life's too short to take a long time to get rich
So I'mma bout to grab a revolver and make this grip quick
We from Virginia, dog, don't about being safe
I stay on my feet, [?]
Switch my flow from crack to [?]
I sold a couple O's and dro, back the d
'Cause the dro move too slow, let's have a meal
Trafficking to feds [?]
[?] used guns to take more dough, so stick in meat, no hoe
Move for the million, man
[?] about a billion grams
Y'all folks, here's the man
Who gon' drink all your liquor and steal your fans
Even my chick in here is about that
They gon' fuck you, kill you and keep their mouth shut
I'm a south cat
All 'cause of links and designer shoes
You was all in the pink [?] line the news
Cockney, German Sheppard gonna find the clues
Trynna see where in the fuck I have the crew
Hide your food, cause we ain't gone starve
You silly if you thinking that we ain't gon rob
Anytime this nigga from Virginia rhyme, it's dinner time
Them seven million [?] and put 'em in the line
I'm better gettin' mine
Star Trak, Fam-Lay, Ice Gang you sucka, cuz
