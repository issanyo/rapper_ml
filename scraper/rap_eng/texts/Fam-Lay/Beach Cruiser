[Hook]
We be rockin' with the beach cruiser
Beach cruiser, stacking on the handlebars
You could ride wid me

[Verse 1 - Famlay]
Look, I'mma be 100 with you
If I can't get no money with you
I ain't running with you, I ain't even come and get you
I ain't being funny with you
Can't do nothing with you
Let your other cousins come and get you
Cause behind my nickle, look, I'mma find my pistols
And shoot my way up out the courtroom like I'm Brian Nicols
Look, it's a blessing from the Heavens if I ain't twist you
Normally, the passenger seat'll be dying with you
Look at you: bullets is the issue
Bullets rip through tissue, bullets rip through gristle
Let a physician fix you
Look, I'm a missile, inside a silo
Cause I know that my flow is like white folk's assault rifles
Sometimes I'm might go Psycho
Sometimes I'm might go  Michael
I'm not no psycho, no this not no fucking typo
I type on iPhones: you vs me is a no-no
White string long, Yo-Yo

[Verse 2 - Famlay]
See all that mess they talkin bout?
They never block him out, they never NARC him out
Singles keep on poppin out
See what people talkin bout?
See what he's talkin bout, see what she talkin bout
T.Y.B.O. poppin out
They mic on the right song my right palm
Like lightning. My right palm is napalm
My icon ?, skate or your bike on
Your fuck on, you fight on
Then bygones be bygones
C'mon: you can ride, you can go, you can slide
You can roll, you can fly, you can float
Hypnotized by the spokes, it's alright if you smoke
We can ride to the store
Meet up: time to re-up, break a lead up
Heat up, light the weed up, beat the beat up
Feet up, put your seat up, put your Vs up
A down, this is a teaser
