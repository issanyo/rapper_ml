And you see the sawed off, nigga better hit the ground

[DJ Cipha Sounds]
Let's go, Star Trak, Def Jam, Fam-Lay, Oh

[Verse: Fam-Lay]
I'm blasting, nigga laying in the street cause
Talked shit, so I hit 'em wit the heat
Runts moving, keys like oz's
Like a cliental, errbody know me
Running! running from the 5-0
Drug life, and it's all about survival
Hustla, known worldwide dawg
I'm in the game and I'm bout to drive by y'all
Gambler, 4 - 5 - 6ing it
10 grand in the bank and I'm sticking it
Bitches, got 'em by the dozens
From their mammy, to their sisters to their couzins
Star Trak, is the crew that I run with
Nigga don't get murdered over dumb shit
Fuck you! it's how I'm caring if
Nigga try to start beef and we burn it

[Hook: Fam-Lay]
When the car roll up and windows roll down
And you see the sawed off, nigga better hit the ground
We getting busy!! You better haul ass dawg!
You better haul ass! You better haul ass dawg!
You better haul ass! (OWW!! getting!!.. OWW!!)
