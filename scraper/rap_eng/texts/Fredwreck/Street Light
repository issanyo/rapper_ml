[Hook]
Underneath the streetlight, now, waiting for the shit to go down
Oh, no, there's gonna be a murder, oh god, when the street go down

[Verse 1]
In Africa everything broken
Ch'Yeah boy, no money no friends
Just live to fight another day
At night the rats come out to play
In the trash, empty streets where rattys rolling thick as thieves
Take your money if you rich
Take your life and rape your bitch

10pm - no body, in the streets just yolandi and me night walking sipping wine, feeling fine, killing time
Night life wild if you feel like fun, some reason didn't bring my gun
My tipsy, giggly and taking selfies, making up rhymes that made me wealthy
Sense the threat, from behind, we stop underneath the street light look past these 6 motherfuckers yep, 6 rattys rolling up on us

[Hook]
Underneath the streetlight, no, waiting for the shit to go down, oh, god
There's gunna be blood on the streets, so much blood on the streets girl, when the shit go down, oh, oh god

[Verse 2]
Fuck, we getting rolled on
Wait, don’t run, just hold on
Didn’t wanna run away into the dark
Six rattys rolled up on us hard, they stick a knife against my guts
They take my phone, who gives a fuck?
Take what you want, I keep calm
Some one ratty grabs Yolandi’s arm
‘Nother rat pull a GAT, but it didn’t go blaow
Motherfucker ratty’s only pull a GAT now
Yolandi starts to fucking kick and make me lose my fucking shit
I busted the motherfuckin’ rat with the GAT
I kicked and hit and bit this guy
Stuck my finger in his eye
Took the ratty’s gun away
No bullets so the ratty’s run away
Set the ratty over there
He dragging my girl by the hair
She’s tryin' her best to get away
He punching my girl in the face
What the fucking fuck, then quick
I smashed a bottle on a brick
Watch a motherfucker like a wild animal

[Bridge]
Blood, blood so much blood, oh, oh no, oh no no
What did I just do, oh my god? oh, jesus fucking christ
Blood, blood so much blood, oh, oh no, please forgive me
What did I just do, oh my god? I didn't mean to kill a man, oh no

[Hook]
Underneath the street light, oh, that's where the shit went down, oh, oh, oh, god, your mama gonna cry tonight, girl, when she hear about the shit that went down, oh, oh, father forgive me

[Outro]
