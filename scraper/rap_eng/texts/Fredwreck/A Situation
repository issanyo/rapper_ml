Situation, have myself some fun
Situation, have myself some fun
Situation, have myself some fun
Situation, have myself some fun

[Verse One] [Sez Batters]
Lyrics cooking in that kitchen, you don’t measure up
I’m hot dog, the mustard's something you could never cut
Catch up/ketchup motherfucker, you still on level 1
They tryna take shots like Ketel One
Take it to the dome, niggas know this a breeze
Flow is cold as some snow and some skis
Stiffer than a popo, sayin' "Nigga freeze"
Got lines like the government, was handing free cheese
Shorty hit video record I’mma wreck her
Say I pushed the right buttons, got her feeling special
That’s cuz I don’t control her
Scared to show her dueces like Noah
Roses really speak, had to sink our friendship
Didn’t have faith but now I’m doing big shit
All about my gravy, say she want my baby
Cuz I’m getting cheese like them crackers, I’m at the Ritz
She’s tryina make a..

[Verse Two] [Freddie High]:
By back against the wall for assault brings the situation
Hit these tracks like stars for the ventilation
I’m in the lane with a dime that I’m penetrating
And her cat is real fat, yeah, Pappy Mason
So what you sayin? Who you playin? It’s that new shit
And L7 be them dudes that I grew with
Been screaming "king" since that nigga named Bling
Food for thought, then I eat plates clean
This shit is feeling right Spike, please Do The Right Thing
Squares spend they whole life rootin' for the right team
Yeah, but I’m sure you niggas know already
It’s that time of the month cause the flow is heavy
The more I levy, they break, my flow cocky
Cause instantly I see my style copied, that’s not me
Watch say it’s my time, A$ap Rocky
Chris Pine, I swear they can’t stop me
Y'all niggas gotta..

Looks like I found me a..
Situation, have myself some fun
Once in a lifetime baby, once in a lifetime
Situation, have myself some fun

[Verse Three] [XV]:
See I never like to party with girls
Eyes get starry
And niggas try to throw shots after throwin shots of Baccardi
In a twist of fate like Jeff Hardy, now I got 'Raries
Leavin they kid just to come in and drive the Ferrari
You ain’t thinking like me, ho you think like Steve Harvey
Keep your nose about my business and your ass off my Atari
That’s what the OG’s taught me so tell my nana I’m sorry
But some wack bitches scarred me in the hotel lobby
Baby face Vizzy, turn 50 bet they still card me
And if I had one of your biddies bet she’d still call me
Wanna determine if that’s a lie, don’t call Maury
Just check your girls Safari, history, bet she bookmark me
No, I used to front with those type hoes
But I said fuck it nigga I'll live my life though
She had a night robe, I had a nice robe
She had the lights low and I had the light bulb
Looks like I found me a...

Situation, have myself some fun
Situation, have myself some fun

[Outro] [XV talking]:
Wuddup yall?
Squarians, that’s what I’m talkin to. I hope you all enjoying Volume 1 so far. Me and DJ Richie still in here. L7. You see, a lot of people, they get confused on what a Squarian is. You know, like being a Squarian ain’t about being a square. You know, so when niggas say that’s square, that ain’t squarian. That’s square, you know what I mean? It’s okay to be yourself, you know? And all we tryina do is promote living your life. That’s what being a Squarian is. About living your life. Love life, loyalty and living long like legends
That’s that L7, nigga
