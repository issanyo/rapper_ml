[Intro: The Notorious B.I.G.]
Huh, check it up, check it up now
Check it up, check it up now
Check it up, check it up now
Huh, huh, hm

[Verse 1: The Notorious B.I.G., Faith Evans & Both]
I got a bitch that suck my dick til' I nut
Spit it on my gut and slurp that shit back up
Ain't that a slut? Hell naw, you be doin' too much
She even take it in the butt, nigga, yeah, yeah, what?
Recognize G, straight up, I can't knock ya
Boy, you know you love it when I call you Big Poppa
You talkin' shit but whenever I'm gone, you be ringin' my phone
Bring yo' ass on home
I roam in Lexuses and Benzes, this is the fly way
With the flyest bitch, gettin' head on the highway
My way deep throat on Luke's boat
When the moon rises, I'm cumin in her eyes-es (do it)
Just the way players play
Leave it up to me, I get fucked all day (we fuck all day)
Sucked all day, smokin' blunts, countin' cheese
My baby is all I need (yeah, oh yeah)

[Chorus: Faith Evans]
That I ain't givin' it up to nobody but you (I ain't givin' it up to nobody)
It ain't never too much to freaky for ya
The sexy things you do, they put me in the mood
Can't get enough of the things that you do

[Verse 2: Faith Evans]
Every time we touch, you givin' me a rush
I'm ready come out my clothes (my clothes)
Look in to your eyes, I'm feelin' your vibe
I'm losin' all control
You're takin' me to Ecstasy
(Boy, it feels so heavenly)
And you know that you are makin' me weak (yeah)
Boy, you got that good thang, so come put it on me
I love the way you do it to me baby
Boy, I'm gettin' hot, can't wait to get you home
Let you hit from the back, sex game strong
Take me to paradise, I want to [?] all night

[Chorus: Faith Evans]
That I ain't givin' it up to nobody but you
It ain't never too much to freaky for ya
The sexy things you do, they put me in the mood
Can't get enough of the things that you do

[Verse 2: The Notorious B.I.G. & Faith Evans]
Biggie bag bitches from barbecues to barmitzvah's
The big donâ€™t fit, use your lips cause..
Fuckin' with me, you know what you get
You be havin' a fit over my lip, yeah
I'm feelin' kinda itchy for a quickie
Don't take off your coat, all you got to do is lick me
Me eat you, I beat you
Baby, you can do whatever you want to me
Which one of these hoes in the lobby wanna slob me?
You know me, I like my dick Brown like Bobby
These bomb-ass chicks ain't ready for you
Unless she lick ass and blow dicks like flutes
I like em cute, round tits and fat asses
Educated, so I can bust off on they glasses
Take it real slow, you can take your time
I wanna cum on your tongue and gums, all night
Baby, you know....

[Chorus: Faith Evans]
That I ain't givin' it up to nobody but you (I ain't givin' it up to nobody)
It ain't never too much to freaky for ya
The sexy things you do, they put me in the mood
Can't get enough of the things that you do (I can't get enough of the things that you do baby)
