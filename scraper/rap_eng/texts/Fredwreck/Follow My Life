[Intro - Obie talking]
Yeah! (*echo*), uh
Let y'all niggas know me
Yeah, (WOO!)

[Verse 1]
Eleven, fourteen, seventy-seven a nigga entered
Big lips, popped out placenta
Mom ain't breast feed, had no pop neither
Pop leaves shit but a name - Obie
Elementary homie that's how it started
In garbage, retarded, gainin that heart
Fuck niggas, claimin they hard, a nigga come home touched
My motherfuckin momma bangin me harder
"Nigga take your ass out their and fight them tomorrow"
That's what she told me, "little punk, blame that on your father"
So I had no choice, nigga pick up a brick
Split a motherfucker's shit for tryin to fuck with the kid
Get a little older, hair on my dick, now I'm curious
Niggas on the corner getting money, rockin jewelry
Allowance, nigga that ain't man shit
Cowardice, nigga that ain't man shit
I had to prove to myself
How these niggas same age as me calculatin this wealth
So I got me a clique and niggas what?
Workin one sixteenth, like "nigga we can clean up"

[Hook] - 2X
Follow my life, homie from start 'til now
Only my motherfuckin momma nigga holds me down
And Lord knows all the shit that I done put her through
I speak through her, straight to you motherfuckers

[Skit - Obie talking]
Two for one, here, here take this, two for one
Quit switching dicks, holla at me, see you fuck with

[Verse 2]
Summer '94, I'm gettin a little dough
Taller than my momma, so I'm listenin to her nose
I'm listenin to them hoes scream "O!"
And I'm listenin to them O's go CHOP! (*echo*)
P-Funk, Joe and me pumpin on the block, summertime
I call her auntie, she cop three at a time
Throw a extra bump bringin cline
I'm so involved with the grind, I'm losin my mind
Fuck a steady job, I'm tryin
I steady mob, I'm dyin in this game, I ain't lyin
Sellin so much coke forgettin it's a crime
Flyin down I-75, pocket full of dimes
Give a fuck about the radar on me (*police sirens*)
Bumpin +Big Poppa+ nigga who tryin me?

[Skit] (*Notorious B.I.G.'s +Big Poppa+ plays in background*)
(Cop) - Get off the god damn truck!
(Obie) - Fuck you, yo I ain't did shit!
(Cop) - Put your fucking hands in the air!
(Obie) - Bitch!

[Hook] - 2X
Follow my life, homie from start 'til now
Only my motherfuckin momma nigga holds me down
And Lord knows all the shit that I done put her through
I speak through her, straight to you motherfuckers

[Outro - Obie talking] (*echo*)
Yeah, all my of life
Only my momma know
Obie .. Obie Trice .. Shady and it's crazy, motherfuckers
