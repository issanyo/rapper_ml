[Verse 1]
The way you smell, the way you taste
You know I have an appetite for sexy things
All you do is look at me, it's a disgrace
What's running through my mind is you up in my face
Yeah, yeah

[Refrain]
Your voice is like music to my ears
Whisper softly and the world just disappears
Take me higher and just wipe away my fears
When you're with me, oh boy, it's my heartbeat that I hear

[Chorus]
Ooh, ooh baby
Touch me and I come alive
I can feel you on my lips
I can feel you deep inside
Ooh, ooh baby
In your arms, I finally breathe
Wrap me up in all your love
That's the oxygen I need, yeah

[Post-Chorus]
You're filling me up
You're filling me up
You're filling me up
You're filling me up
You're filling me up
You're filling me up with your love

[Verse 2]
The more you move, the more I dance
It's like you got me hypnotized, I'm in a trance
Your jersey fits, it's right at home, between my hands
But now I hope you know that I'm your biggest fan
Yeah, yeah

[Refrain]
Your voice is like music to my ears
Whisper softly and the world just disappears (World disappears)
Take me higher and just wipe away my fears
When you're with me, oh boy, it's my heartbeat that I hear

[Chorus]
Ooh, ooh baby
Touch me and I come alive
I can feel you on my lips
I can feel you deep inside
Ooh, ooh baby
In your arms, I finally breathe
Wrap me up in all your love
That's the oxygen I need, yeah

[Post-Chorus]
You're filling me up
You're filling me up
You're filling me up
You're filling me up
You're filling me up
You're filling me up with your love

[Bridge]
You got something that I really want, and
Come here, oh, we don't even have to talk, and
Lay back and let me tell you what I'm thinking
'Cause I like you (I like you), 'cause I like you

[Breakdown]
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby
Ooh, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby
Ooh, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby
Baby (baby), baby (baby), baby

[Chorus]
Ooh, ooh baby
Touch me and I come alive
I can feel you on my lips
I can feel you deep inside
Ooh, ooh baby
In your arms, I finally breathe
Wrap me up in all your love
That's the oxygen I need
Ooh, ooh baby
Touch me and I come alive
I can feel you on my lips
I can feel you deep inside
Ooh, ooh baby
In your arms, I finally breathe
Wrap me up in all your love
That's the oxygen I need, yeah

[Outro]
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby
Baby (baby), baby (baby), baby
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby
Baby (baby), baby (baby), baby
