Some of the most impenitence, incredible, magnificent "yeah"

This nigga ain't on his first Rolex "yeah"
This nigga done hittin' switches and smackin bitches since day one
Ho, act like you know

Nigga, this nigga done walkin on the water
Pimpin, throwin' some hoes out of the movin' vechiles
Goddamn, what the fuck you got to do?
Do we got to bring the game to you on a motherfuckin silver platter?
Do we got to enforce feed this shit into you?
Or you just gonna sit back and listen to this L.P.?
Nigga recognize, learn somethin'
Increase your wealth, learn how to knock a bitch
This is the real shit
Peep game, for real...
