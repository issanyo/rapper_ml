[Verse 1 : B-Real]
I'm in the city of sunshine
But don't be fooled!
They say it never rains
I can tell you: "That ain't true."
Cause when you hustle on the streets
So that you can feed your family
Depending on what you hustle
Niggas could just kill a man!
The game of life
I'm a full-time player!
Never settle for less I keep searching
For what's greater
Inspite of any hater portrayal
I keep it moving
Never fucked anyone over
Cause it comes back later!
At the dump it's a long fall
When you hit the bottom
People remember all the attitudes
You shot 'em!
The minute you fall
You're as good as forgotten!
Thought you had it all
But it all went rotten
But no many times I have failed
I've never let anything get in the way
Of my dreams and hot spells
I stay focussed with my mind on the price
And if you try to block me
Then we push you aside!

[Pre-Hook : Sen Dog]
Yeah, that's right; yo!
Hip-Hop veteran!
Gon' tell you that we better than most of these fools out here!

[Hook : B-Real + Sen Dog]
Easy they come when you got the dough!
It's the Hill, baby! (it's the Hill, baby!)
It's the Hill, baby! (it's the Hill, baby!)
Easy they go when you got no mo'!
Spit it real, baby! (spit it real, baby!)
Spit it real, baby! (spit it real, baby!)
C'mon! (c'mon!)
Easy they come when they want your soul!
Shit is real crazy! (shit is real crazy!)
Shit is real crazy! (shit is real crazy!)
Easy they go when yo' shit gets old
Shit is real crazy! (shit is real crazy!)
The game is so shady lately! (the game is so shady lately!)

[Verse 2 : Sen Dog]
This business ain't nothing
But a series of comebacks (comebacks!)
Write you off as dead 'til you
Come back with a bomb track! (bomb track!)
Man you got to save food
Cause they said you washed-up (it was washed up!)
Even if your prays nothin'
All over your hot stuff! (all over your hot stuff!)
That's right I believe in myself and my talent (that's right!)
Skills have been diminshed; motherfucker
There you have it! (there you have it!)
You got to learn the game
Master every angle (master every angle!)
Like a zen master runnin'
The triangle! (runnin' the triangle!)
Just when they think
That you're all dried up (you're all dried up!)
Surprised that they asked when
The back don't cut! (when the back don't cut!)
All around the globe
Keep a silent fan base, (shut up!)
Hip-Hop icon -
Tell you what it takes! (tell you what it takes!)
Patience, persistence. -
Perseverance! (perseverance!)
Know it in your song, they gon' love it
When they hear it!
[?] the career been down
And [?] for years!
Nobody's takin' me out;
I'll decide when I'm outta here! (I'll decide when I'm outta here!)

[Pre-Hook : Sen Dog]
That's right y'all!
EZ come EZ go!
[?] Cypress Hill, dog!
We takin' it forever, G!

[Hook]

[Verse 3 : B-Real]
I got love for every fan
Ever part of the plane
So while you can take some pictures
And sign some autographs
Share a couple of hits
Of my kush [?] is you should ask
But if you push!
Then I put my foot in your ass!
Not many in this game would
Last so long
So they can get what they can
Before the time is done
People are gona stay with you
But you must never mislead them
But if you treat them wrong
Lead them on they'll say: "We don't need you!"
Then it's back to
The streets to square one
Now you're screaming:
"This ain't fair!" Yeah
But nobody cares!
You had the money and the cars
Big house and pearls
Jewels and hot beats
So that you could spit out words!
So much time and emotion invested
From being on top;
Nigga, can't get arrested!
EZ come, EZ go;
When they forget who you are
Forget you were star
Forget you in every regard!

[Outro : Sen Dog]
Yeah!
My maaan... still comin' at-chaaaaa!

[Hook]
