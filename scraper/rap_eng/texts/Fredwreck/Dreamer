[Verse 1]
I'm at the grocery store and there you are just watching me
Pick up my clothes from the cleaners and look who I see
I try to lose you in my car, but you won't go away
C'mon, buddy, don't you think you've overstayed your stay?
Don't you have better things to do with your life
Than hang around, and stare at me, and complicate mine?
Your eyes must burn so bad 'cause you haven't blinked
You and me will never be if that's what you think

[Chorus]
Ohh, you're such a dreamer
But I'm not a believer in all the things that you dream
Stop watching me, stop watching me

[Verse 2]
I go to bed and I wake up, isn't that interesting?
I brush my teeth, and feed my dogs, isn't that thrilling?
(Don't you think that that's thrilling, don't you think?)
It must be fun to follow me pretending we're a thing
It's just so messed up
Can't you see that you're just scaring me?

[Chorus]
Ohh, you're such a dreamer
But I'm not a believer in all the things that you dream
Stop watching me, stop watching me
Ohh, you're such a dreamer
But I'm not a believer in all the things that you dream
Stop watching me, stop watching me

[Bridge]
Don't you have better things to do with your life
Than hang around and stare at me and complicate mine?
Don't you have better things to do with your life
Than hang around and stare at me and complicate mine?

[Chorus]
Ohh, you're such a dreamer (You're such a dreamer)
But I'm not a believer (I'm not a believer)
In all the things that you dream (In everything that you dream)
Stop watching me, stop watching me
Ohh, you're such a dreamer (You're such a dreamer)
But I'm not a believer (Iâ€™m not gonna believe)
In all the things that you dream
Stop watching me, stop watching me
Stop watching me, stop watching me
Stop watching me
