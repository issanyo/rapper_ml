[Intro]
One time for the legendary Rakim
One time for the legendary Z-Ro
Southwest Alief Texas, this is for us baby

[Verse 1]
Off the bat, I attack, word to Bruce Wayne
I spit crack and I strapped, don't need a shoe string
But don’t confuse things, the good shepard gave me a new frame
Of mind, so you can see that I'm different, that's word to 2 Chainz
Ooh, but I’m still the same ol' G
I stay lowkey with mo sauce than Aeoli
I play goalie when blessings start to rain on me
And catch a lot of chips and gaucamole, Ooh
That's monetary blessings for you slow people
My flow a monastery for them extra poor people
That don't get commentary and get honored rarely
For the guava jelly they produce, even though they get thrown fecal
Matter on a platter, made by their oppressor
I shatter all the chatter that seems to make us lesser
Than anybody that put on they drawers the same way I do
Name could be Motley, the way I get it rockin' wit' my crew
But it ain't, my name Tobe Chukwu
Which means praise God, but just like Face Mob, I knew too well
Just how good it felt to be a gangsta
Rolled wit' more G’s than bankers, but somehow found sanctums
All up and through the streets of Alief
Grew up a beast but in my pants kept a crease
Now I slay beats, remember when I would slay freaks
Back when Sherwin worked at Popeyes and would sneak an eight piece box
Of chicken straight through the drive thru
Back when we was young, dumb, and broke in high school
And we would dodge guns and swung on those in piru
And would ride, live and die by one concise rule
That’s unless it's a one on one, no spectating
Or you’ll get hit and be tryna to breathe when your chest vacant
That's the hood definition of breathtaking
No Wes Craven, I seen Horror films on the West Daily
Ooh, but you play the cards you dealt when you don't get to pick it
Fat ain't the thickest, but she solicit Yahweh the quickest
Most people get explicit when trying to visit the mountain top
With intentions to sacrifice all that but that in the thicket
Ooh, I’m speaking solely of atonement
And most would get it if they weren't living just for the moment
The air we breathe is rented, repent if you think you own it
That's hard to comprehend when you busy bending them corners
Loners is what they say you must become to separate yo self
That's a misnomer, relationships are the greatest wealth
The problem is you in relationships where hate itself
Is the sole establishment so much that you wouldn't date ya self
Ouch, that's a pinch that might cause an abrasion
But don't fret, we all miss some steps effing with Satan
He got to pissing on my leg and told me it's raining
But that urination led to the actualization
Of me cracking the safe in my life to look past the frustration
Of one of my partners clappin' himself and blasting hisself and
Realizing that the world is flawed
Though it's all Gucci, it's the same dookie in different stalls
Elohim introduced me to Lucy so we could waltz
Then wiped me down like Boosie and used me to make withdrawals
On folk that got integrity and light
Then pass it back to those that lack the necessities of life
The recipe for equity ain't in celebrity hype
And yo destiny low-key tied to the destiny of the device
That has yo spirit mangled, I peep yo frustrations
Stop giving CPR to dead situations
Some people don't go far 'cause they too impatient
I went from rapping in the car to rapping with Sway and
Tracy G, I audaciously
Murdered every beat that they gathered on the plate for me
So they plainly see how the spirit embraces me
Way before I get to see all the G's like freemasonry
Ooh, taste and see the goodness of the
Drinking gourd, my Lord, reward the horde that
Follow the torch you stored inside my pen
My flow be leading 'em towards shores that might convince them
That healing just might can happen for the nappy heads
But feet can't stop at the beach, dig deep, push past the edge
And let yo toes hit that water, renew yo aura
But keep a pistol to slaughter any demons that come at cha neck
And that's all I got
Holla
