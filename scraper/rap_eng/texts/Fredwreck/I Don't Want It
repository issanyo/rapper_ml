[Verse 1: The Notorious B.I.G.]
How you spell cash? C's and some hash
At last, a nigga kickin' game full blast
How you want it? Diamonds or dime-elles?
Jansport bookbags and bags from Chanel
Issey Miyake, smellin' up my Kawasaki
Jawns by Versace all them joints by Jockey
Clock me workin' real hard for a nickel
He drive a tricycle and his pants too little
And his shoes too little
Won't you get with the clique with the big ass dicks
That make sure your kicks fit
The real shit, true, balla pack steel shit
The nigga with, the movie and the mill shit
Mass appeal get me in the clubs for free
So all you got to do for me is just
Make your way to my king sized bed
And lie on my pillows and my Gucci bed spread
Keep the pussy, I got other plans instead
Just gimme some head, gimme some head

[Chorus: Faith Evans]
If you ain't fuckin' me for life
I don't want it, I don't want it
And if you ain't tryna make me your wife
I don't need it, I don't need it
I'm not about that life
I don't get down, get down like that

[Verse 2: The Notorious B.I.G. & Faith Evans]
Some bitches do and some bitches don't
Some niggas spend cash on that ass
Shit, I know I won't!
That shit you kickin'? Nigga it ain't hittin'
It is what it is, hope you can handle your biz
A real nigga know he gotta put his back in it
If it's some weed, fuck around and pull the crack in it
I see you talk so slick, but you cum real quick
This bomb ass shit, got your cigarettes lit
Nine outta ten women wanna spin, honestly
Hold up, nigga wait
Them bitches ain't me, I'm what 9/10 other women wanna be
Better tell 'em Lil Cease

[Verse 3: Lil Cease]
Ayo, you crazy sis, don't put me in that shit
Fuck around and say the wrong shit and I'll be in a twist
You know that nigga Big get high and start trippin'
Try to make you mad, but then you get to flippin'
Ayo Fiz, I understand where you comin' from
But these hoes is savages, son!

[Verse 4: Faith Evans]
Let me put it to you like this
'Cause really, I'm just tryna make this clear
You don't need to be confusin', get the wrong idea
You got to earn much, you need to have a plan
'Cause I'm the type you want to wife, I ain't no one-night-stand
The only way I'm rockin' this, you got to put a ring on it
You gotta lock it down (lock it down), show me what you really about

[Chorus: Faith Evans]
If you ain't fuckin' me for life
I don't want it, I don't want it
And if you ain't tryna make me your wife
I don't need it, I don't need it
I'm not about that life
I don't get down, get down like that
If you ain't fuckin' me for life
I don't want it, I don't want it
And if you ain't tryna make me your wife
I don't need it, I don't need it
I'm not about that life
I don't get down, get down like that
