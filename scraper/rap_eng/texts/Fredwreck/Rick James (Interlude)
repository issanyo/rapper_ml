[Dave Chappelle as Rick James]
*dial tone*
Snoop Dogg, Snoop Doggy Dogg what's up?
What's up bitch, it's Rick James
It's Rick James bitch
How the fuck you gonna do Mary Jane without me?
One of the best singin', one of the best lookin' muthafuckas
One of the best, most talented muthafuckas ever in music
That's fucked up Snoop
Shit, fuck weed
Cocaine's a helluva drug nigga
How 'bout that?
And that's real
I was in love with Mary Jane first muthafucka
I'm Rick James bitch
I'll break in ya house and grind my feet on ya couch bitch
That's how I'm livin'
Snoop Doggy Dogg
