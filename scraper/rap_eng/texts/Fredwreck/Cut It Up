[Verse1]
Let's hit the street tonight
We got the brand new ride
We got the beat that's tight
Me and my boy inside
Let's ride until the wheels fall off
All the ladies scream and shout
All the fellas ball
Cause we goin' to the club tonight
Man, I'm buying up the bar once I get inside
East Coast, West Coast show love, from the North to the South
Everybody Cut it up, Cut it up

[Hook]
Cut it up, Cut it up
Cut it up, Cut it up
Cut it up, Cut it up
Cut it up, Cut it up
Cut it up, Cut it up
Cut it up, Cut it up
Cut it up, Cut it up
Cut 'em up

[Verse 2]
Ooh, look at the big time stunner
Cruising down uh, hauling in the new hummer
You know I stole it, you know I stay rolling
Me and my boy, boy we ride like Soulja's
Big Chucky ooh I'm so lucky
I'm a murderous psychopath toy
They can't touch me
I'm ill-er than MJ's Thriller
See the scar on my face?
Like Pacino, I'm a killer
Cut it up

[Verse 3]
Cut it up, Cut it up
Cut it up, Cut it up
Cut it up, Cut it up
Cut it up, Cut it up
Cut it up, Cut it up
Cut it up, Cut it up
Cut it up, Cut it up
Cut 'em up

Whoever thought that I was a joke
I slit they throat, then drank a runny Coke
My hit movie, and I'm ill-er than ever
Tougher than leather, getting way more clever
Everybody in the club, feeling this
Big Chucky with his son and of course his Miss'
So beware if you got a flat tire
Slay Jason, Freddy Krueger and even Michael Myers
Cut it up

[Hook]
Cut it up, Cut it up
Cut it up, Cut it up
Cut it up, Cut it up
Cut it up, Cut it up
Cut it up, Cut it up
Cut it up, Cut it up
Cut it up, Cut it up
Cut 'em up
