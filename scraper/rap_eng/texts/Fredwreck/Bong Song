[Verse 1: B-Real]
Once upon a time, not long ago
I had an 8 foot bong with the strongest stroke
And no, it was not for knocking mothafuckas out
One hit, that's it, nigga sleeping on the fucking couch
But maybe you're tripping out rather quietly
Off in the corner, having anxiety, hoping for some privacy
Lips touch glass smoke fills lungs brain cells lit
Now you elevate, top floor, homie what

[Verse 2: Xzibit]
Once upon a time, in the projects yo
Me and my homies had to grow
24 lights, air tight, was lit right
Turn around, pounce, one vode is clip night
Backwards bought like I'm paying the invoice
The contact hire had ya higher than Lloyd's voice
Abracadabra, lit loud in a Rolls Royce
So sit your ass down, stop talking and roll joints

[Skit]
*Smash*
Aww my bad
Ay, what the fuck you doing dawg you just broke the bong
Pass me them papers, imma roll myself a fat one mang
And we'll get it lit

[Verse 3: Garrick Grout]
Once upon a time, not long ago
I had a household bong that my mom would toke
Joint rip, got the funky feel tint
Xzibit just shot me a hit, made me quit
Wacks got them poppin' out dimensions
[?] took a dab, started [?] projectin'
Backward gettin [?] in
Live risin' you still session resin'
Man that shit depressin'

[Bridge: Garrick Grout]
Ay
Here's a lesson
Yuh
This a procession

[Verse 4: B-Real]
Now back to the lecture at hand
I'm about to pack this gram in a fol' and go ham
Hit it [?] hard high feeling close to god
The bong hits like a Tyson blow to the [?]
[?] in your chest, you say "I can't breathe"
Now the feeling's coming on and you can't leave
Got you stuffed asking "Why'd I hit this damn thing"
Gasping, tryna write it down, one last thing

[Verse 5: Xzibit]
Let me buy dub sack dirty bag bong weed
[?] ass niggas you can never smoke with us
Brass knuckle brigade, die from a grenade
Hey you wanna get high?
Stop ducking the fade
Open up the bag then break out them zags
Take two puffs, enough, now make that pass
Who cuts the fucking joint that god damn long
Now I gotta roll another one so hit this bong now

[Xzibit]
I swear to fucking god man
Every time you get high you start talking like a fucking bitch

[Verse 6: Garrick Grout]
Back to the 8 foot bong
Honey cone, double [?] you [?] it hit it strong
Pulled a smoke probably get knocked unconscious
Concentrated, my concentrate's obnoxious
Toxic, I be getting smoked out daily
Wonder if they did it like me in the 80's
Coming out the 90's, brownies so strong it can blind me
Faded on Mars where you find me

[Hook]
I got so high
I think I might die
Stuck on my couch
With cottonmouth
I got so high
I think I might die
Stuck on my couch
With cottonmouth

[Robotic voice]
