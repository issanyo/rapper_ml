[Verse 1]
What's wrong with me?
I get lonely in a crowd
Everyone is smiling, but I made myself left out
I've got an imaginary shield around me
But nobody's ever really getting through
I keep thinking that they're gonna break me free
But they never do, no

[Chorus]
When somebody's knocking
When somebody wants me
When somebody's trying to love me completely
I get scared
Don't know how it works
Will somebody save me, or will I get burned?
Don't wanna get burned

[Verse 2]
There's a thickness in the air weighing heavy on my heart
Why can't I just fit in?
Why can't I do what everyone else does?
People come around like a storm when you least expect them to
For me, I run for cover when I should really face the truth, oh

[Chorus]
When somebody's knocking
When somebody wants me
When somebody's trying to love me completely
I get scared
Don't know how it works
Will somebody save me, or will I get burned?
Don't wanna get burned

[Breakdown]
What's wrong with me?
I get lonely in a crowd
Everyone is smiling, but I made myself left out

[Chorus]
When somebody's knocking
When somebody wants me
When somebody's trying to love me completely
I get scared
Don't know how it works
Will somebody save me, or will I get burned?
Don't wanna get burned
When somebody's knocking
When somebody wants me
When somebody's trying to love me completely
I get scared
Don't know how it works
Will somebody save me, or will I get burned?
Don't wanna get burned

[Outro]
I get scared
Don't know how it works
Will somebody save me, or will I get burned?
I get scared
Don't know how it works
Will somebody save me, or will I get burned?
I get scared
Don't know how it works
Will somebody save me, or will I get burned?
