[Verse 1: Tray Deee]
Nappy heads, free lunches, food stamps; how we come up
Represent the set, disrespect and we nut up
Run up on a motherfucker strapped or not
And once we ride, we ain't hiding we at the spot
Flipping sacks, hitting Yak, for the bread and meat
Either take off a space off and scared to eat
And I was taught from the start have heart, have money
I have to live lovely if I have to make it ugly

[Verse 2: Goldie Loc]
I'm smashing the game bossed out
Never trip, kept my head up, man the homies flossed out
Eastside thang fool back on that ass
It don't stop you know we always making cash
Stash spot on deck, police come no sweet
'Serve there ass Goldie so they never forget'
Kick on kak while a nigga rip rhymes stay banging on that motherfucking mad ass Eastside

[Chorus: Bamm]
Roll 'em, smoke 'em, make that money
On the Eastside, land of milk and honey
Bull rag idol 'round the 'K
Bang those blue shoes straight away
We tip, we crip, were fly
Straight to the spot, yeah we ride
We toss that throwaway
Bang those blue shoes straight away

[Verse 3: Goldie Loc]
(We on fire) Steady lighting up the scene with this all blue attire
Don't stop now let me hear the whole thing
Bumpin' this shit'll make your momma gangbang
Tied a rag around a cane, hit the streets bring 'em pain
Young black male push the set with my gang
Never throw your hands up when come I'ma bust, hardest rap in the cut, go and get fucked up

[Verse 4: Tray Deee]
On my major chase, paper make the earth go round
Everybody heated, its about the first to draw
Aim, squeeze, take cheese, bang these, escape!
On the grind, sunshine 'til the evening - late
Niggas scheme and hate but when I bring the 'K
I lay down a whole crowd when I sweep the place
No pity, stone gritty, Long Beach for life
Do or die, nigga stand on the creep for mine

[Chorus: Bamm]

[Verse 5: Tray Deee & Goldie Loc]
You be making out that we be 'bout a million strong
When everybody spit the lyrics when they hear our songs
Still G'd up, speak up if you got deez
21st street Eastside I C Gs

We them eastside ridaz, making money
We play for keeps, cos for us ain't nothing funny
Get your wig pushed back try'na start some shit
Lil' Loco from the 1 5 rolling dub Crip

Straight banging, steady bringing rip riding heat
With that young top gun on the side of me
You niggas wish that we would quit
But we ain't about to slip
The only thing we giving up is coming out the clip

Stay true to the streets, move fast with the heat
Bite down on the beat, keep them chucks on your feet
Tray Deee, Goldie Loc C walking in your sleep
(Haha) Were C walking in your sleep

[Chorus: Bamm]
