[Intro]
I begin to fall
I begin to fall
I begin to fall, fall, fall, fall...

[Verse 1: Braille]
Gravity got a hold of me
Enemies tower over me
It won't be over easy
They scramble the frequency
I hear voices try'na speak to me
Try'na take my peace from me
Even when they go away they leave with a piece of me
I just wanna go our separate ways and live peaceably
Put it all behind us, they continue to rewind it
Add to the confusion when I'm looking for the minus
And y'all took a piece
But I don't know where mine is
Maybe my greatest weakness was my kindness
And I just need silence
Why does it seem like violence is the only way to find a moment of peace and quiet
Taking thoughts captive, so many to collect
When they dance around my head while I'm close to the edge
Don't push!
I blame everyone but me
Even though it's plain to see I was a kamikaze, that's right
I'm the captain of my own ship
Yeah, I'm the captain of my own ship-
Wreck, lost at sea
Living above the law
Not that it was warranted
Thinking I'm innocent
Then they showed me where the warrant is
I'm drowning in guilt
My grave is the bed I made
What I thought what was watching out for me was actually a
Razor blade wrapped around my wrist
Time wasn't on my side
It didn't have me back when confronted with my pride
Does it lead to the fall, I can't remember which is first
It's the start  of the end, December 1st as I burst through the clouds
I'm leaving this whole world behind me
Must have forgot that this world lives inside me
I tried to escape, I was flying but I fell
When you buy into the lie, it's your soul that you sell
I was falling to my death but before the sun set
The Son stepped in my place
The one who gave me breath took the fall so I fell
In the palms of His hands
And I fell to my knees and surrendered my plans
Now I'm close to the Son, walking in the light
Waiting for the day when my faith turns to flight

[Bridge]
I begin to fall

[Verse 2: JGivens]
Sometimes I feel like
Harvey Dent with two faces
Reminded death is a choice
That's only a flip away
Of a coin and I'm tired of flipping like birds in a gym-nest
Directed by Wes Craven or Hitchcock nonetheless
I'm tired
I'm so tired of being strong in front of the choir
And wretched when I'm alone and I'm jaded
I hate it
I hate my sin
I hate it, I hate it, I hate it, I hate it, I hate it
I hate the reason
Why I think they say I'm their favorite
As soon as they play it as if the music I'm making
Could substitute for any one or
Two of the hundred and fifty from David
I'm Saul when I'm naked
I'm falling in anguish
They all thinking if there's a
K or a M on your followers then that probably mean that I'm famous and these are pre-teens that say this
Try to escape it
I'm not and I don't, I don't want to be
Till the benefits of it hover in front of me
How I'm gon' to live up to Humble Beast
When I'm mumbling
Underneath tumbling from a tree
Of the knowledge of good and the
Evil deceitful covering up with the public me
And now Iâ€™m wondering, what
Good is the motor of running-backs that keep fumbling?
Does he dream of the day that we play it up on the jumbo screen?
Lupe Fiasco was view like liquor and food
Just to prove you are just as fly as the coolest Judas with Jesus
Piece nooses and submarines
See I had other dreams try'na fill other shoes
And now I covet you
You in that office despising your ten to two
And you, turning in missing an assignments, tired of school
Sometimes the grass you thinking is greener is really blue
There is a beast lying beneath at the surface searching for food
There's a reason why wisdom always seems to run from a fool
Sometimes the beast ain't the serpent it's really you, so
Stay more submitted
Take your repentance like way more serious than mere confession and scream out mayday with more intentions to change the traditions
Stay more in spirit
Wait for what you say the spirit can prove
And mention @prayforjgivens
A name that I pray you do
