[Intro]
A priest-judge is a temple guardian
Commissioned by the Lord to guard His holy presence from evil
And execute judgment on anything unclean that would defile His holy temple
Adam was a priest-judge
Adam was a priest-judge

[Verse 1]
Adam was a priest-judge, he was
Put in Eden to keep it from anything unclean cause
It was a temple, God with His people
So Adam's job was to guard it from evil
Genesis 2, turn to the part
Verse 15 and observe this remark
For 'keep,' the Hebrew verb is 'shamar'
And in its context yo, the word means 'to guard'
And this is seen in chapter 3:24
Where Adam's no longer priest anymore
Cause of his arrogance ensnared in sin
Now shamar's used for the guards--the cherubim
Cause of what happened back a few verses
An intruder in the garden, that was the serpent
Was it an accident? No, it happened on purpose
For Adam to image God and smash him for certain

[Verse 2]
And since Adam fell
Yahweh chose a new priestly race in Genesis chapter 12
Though Abraham's from a pagan fam
The Great I AM called him to Canaan and
It's a new Eden, new creation land
Flowing with milk and honey where His holy place would stand
In the midst of this nation clan
For them to be priest to every race of man
Seen in Abraham's desperate plea
Full of intercession to rescue please
His nephew Lot before he's wrecked to cease
But they're not just ancients of blessed peace
Israel is His collective priest
To judge those who sin incessantly
Genesis 15, the text it reads:
"The sin of the Amorites is not yet complete"
In other words, this double purpose
To rescue His precious kids in Exodus was to show abundant mercies
Plus for his judging servants to bring justice curses
On Canaanites for disgusting worship
And they must deserve it
Cause they're really the offspring of that ugly serpent

[Verse 3]
Be convinced as I teach
Exodus 19, Israel's a kingdom of priests
True indeed, but do you see
The Levites are priest-judges within the community
Yahweh's holy wrath is intense
Beholding the golden calf incident
So Moses boldly asks of his men
Who love the Lord, it don't matter the sin
The Levites as a whole gather to him
To hear the holy task that he gives
"Take your sword from your thigh cause the Lord was despised"
Killed 3,000 who abhorred Adonai
A strange form of praise and worship
Maybe these verses make you nervous?
But Exodus 32:29, that day was the Levites' ordination service
Jump with me to Numbers 3
The Levites were to kill anyone unclean
Their priestly charge was to keep and guard
The tabernacle, several times we see "shamar"
Leviticus, since Yahweh is in the midst
Purge sin and get rid of this
But the illest is Phineas
Who saw the insidious worship of Baal hideous
He went in the tent
Where an Israelite laid with the woman from Midian
Then he stabbed them in their abdomen
With a javelin so God's wrath was spent
He was a priest-judge

[Verse 4]
The Promised Land was blessed and precious
The place of Yahweh's special temple presence
So the wicked yes, best be put to death
Intruders in the land, they should be dispossessed (yarash!)
Driven out, given now into the hand of Joshua who quickly rout
Stricken and hit, no doubt
Then slain by the edge of the sword with a shout, listen pal
Priest-judgment was what the Canaanite conquest is about
Foreshadowed by Abram who slaughtered kings
Devoted to destruction, his offerings
But this is rowdy, right?
When Saul failed to kill Agag the Amalekite
Samuel shows what an actual priest is
With his sword, he hacks Agag to pieces (rowdy!)
Crushing the head of Goliath with a rock
Cause that serpent defied the living God
In David's killing spree of Philistines
A priest-judge king is really seen
So it's not limited to a specific office
Elijah smitten all the wicked, it's the prophets
After God's fire consumed the entire offering, Elijah slaughtered them (Shachat!)

[Verse 5]
All these priest judges were incomplete
But there's a final Prophet-Judge-Kingly-Priest
Yeah, I'm talking about Jesus the Lord
The One who came not to bring peace, but a sword
The first Adam should've did what's essential
So the second Adam was cleansing the temple
Of the wicked and unlawful
Then washing the feet of His twelve new Israel apostles
Cause He's the Lamb and the Priest and the Temple
Judged in our place for our deeds that are sinful
So the living God has raised Him
To destroy that false temple, that synagogue of Satan
70 AD, now His holy discipline does steadily spank me
His true temple, He's changing His nation
Tearing down our idols and sanctification
His grace is aflaming, cleansing His peeps
His church is His end-time kingdom of priests
So in church discipline
Now the elders are priest-judges to purge sinful men
Though Josh in the Land routs heathens
The greater Joshua was casting out demons
When He returns, he'll physically, spiritually
Cleanse the land of all who displease Him
In the Greek text follow
Matthew 12, to cast out demons, we see 'ekballo'
Revelation 12 says in its pages
He casts out Satan from the heavenly places
Along with his henchmen
Already at the cross and resurrection, accomplished at ascension
But at the Second Coming
You'll the perfect picture of the Priest-Judge executing judgment
Revelation 19 demonstrates what I mean
See His robes, He's arrayed as High Priest
Watch the Son of God unleash
Millions of saints and angels, His squad is deep
Bronze His feet, when in His sovereign seat
He returns to squash the beef
Christ the cosmic Priest when at the perfect season
Will come to do His earthly cleaning
It will be purged of heathens
Thrown into the eternal furnace heated
With the fury of the wrath of the Almighty
Then we'll worship God rightly
Since the Son's faithful
We'll fulfill our second Adam's status as we judge angels
Since the Son's faithful
We'll fulfill our second Adam's status as we judge angels

[Hook]
Christian, you a priest-judge because He was
Now we crush deeds of greed, lust
So that Jesus' deep love is seen much
He was double Priest-Judge so clean up, clean up!

He kills sin
