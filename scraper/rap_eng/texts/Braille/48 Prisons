[Intro - Braille]

Let's see what Xperiment made for the record
Dude, what is that â€” like, Morse code?
You picked the right production name, I'll give you that
Everything you make sounds like an experiment
This beat is so weird!
How am I supposed to rap over this?
For real, come on, man
COWBELL!

[Hook - Unknown]

Spit prison cells
Livin' in the world, no different, for myself

[Verse 1 - Braille]

Tried to get it right the first time
But I couldn't nail it
You only get one shot
I'm aimin' with a nail gun
Trigger happy, took a couple extra under pressure
Sweatin' bullets but I let the salt marinate my skin
Salt of the earth, walkin' closer to the fault line
Whose fault is it? It's mine, but I'll share
Contagious, beware, Visionaire with a blank stare
Bankrupt souls, who wants to be a millionaire

There's a million ways to die, only one catalyst
Sin is the enemy we battle with
Jealousy don't gel with me
This felony just fell on me
Keep this dirty little secret
Like, tattletale, don't tell on me
Everything in moderation
Monitor your consumption
Get in a slump and blame others for your corruption
The gossip is toxic
Intoxicated at a toxic bar, saying, "At least I'm not a rapist"

It's tasteless
You can run but can't escape it
Watching pornography, constantly washin' your hands
So much audacity
Actin' like you're innocent 'cause someone else is worse than you
Take it personal
We perpetrate it, look at the data
Crooked nature can't manage the commandment to love our neighbors
Danger, danger, we can never earn the favor
Or deserve fellowship with the Creator, so holy

Try to be the hero but we're more like heroin
Boastin' about our bondage, ignorant and arrogant
They want that pure, uncut, and unadulterated
I want that pure, uncut, but no adultery
Tell me lies, sweet little lies
White lies come from black hearts
Take the mask off, face the facts raw
None of our facades are foolin' the triune God

[Interlude - Braille]

This beat's actually kinda hard, dude
Nah, I'm feelin' it
Yo, but this song's called "48 Prisons"
I only spit 32 bars, we gotta keep it going
Gimme more!

[Verse 2 - Braille]

Pleasures of this world leave me thirsty with an empty cup
Twisted definitions of manhood, I can't measure up
Loosen my possessions, in the heavens throw my treasures up
Better get some shelter when the bad weather comes
When the rain falls, when it's all said and done
I just wanna be conformed into the image of the Son
To live is Christ, to die is gain
You were murdered for my shame, I will suffer for your name

No one took your life, the sacrifice you freely gave it
Set free all the captives and broke the chains of enslavement
Rose from the grave in a glorified body
No false prophets can make the same claims
I'm inconsistent but the Lord is magnificent
And my life is significant 'cause he's the one givin' it
Makin' me obedient, sanctified livin'
Jesus the ransom for sinners, he can unlock the prison
