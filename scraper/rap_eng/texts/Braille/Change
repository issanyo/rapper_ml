[Hook]
I'm so through wasting words, here let me show ya
I'm so done wasting words, homie let help me show the (world)
This is project action, I'm sure, I'm sure
Well if you know like I know, then let's go change the world
I'm so through wasting words, Jah come show them

[Verse 1: Propaganda]
When'd we get so cool with so-so?
Brains are B+ so now mediocre's dope tho
But that's another subject, next album's called Excellent
Already started writing, that's a biblical work ethic
Real manhood, faithfully forming family
Developing godly kids, my best gift to this community
Hopes that God'll use me to leave bruises on the booth sheet
Humbly sharpen Sharpies and speak sharply
Young learned to practice being hip to scare tactics
Stop giving me lies but [cotton pictures are dead men?]
Never blame my skin, outright out-write ya
Stainless steel spines just to spite you biters
Speak in definition, no inch of this is shy
Our culture's diabetic, I got raps that act as insulin
Still the only hope for real change is found in Christ alone
He leaves you jailbroke like my iPhone

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Braille]
Yeah, the world is fading away and everything in it
Will eventually diminish so take a minute and listen
Adjust your antennas and get a vision, the way I'm spittin'
It's like fishing lines, I'm focused on the finish line
[?] with the fire ignited
I get delighted when men living in darkness get transformed and enlightened
Restoration through the gospel truth is possible
Even when it sounds illogical, stand back and watch the Spirit move
Jesus don't discriminate, he forgave prostitutes
Made 'em clean when they believed 'cause He can change everything
This constitutes a response from us despite our pompous attitude
This sin inside of us is so monstrous
We say "in God we trust" but live for our greed and lust
Askin' God to give us more, He gave up His Seed for us
Cured our disease, made us pure and blameless
So if you got a wicked heart, Jesus can change it
