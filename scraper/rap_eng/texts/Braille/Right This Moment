Right this moment, yo we're running out of time
We'll see if I get to finish this rhyme
Life on earth is cursed, the curtain closes, eyes open
Searching for peace in final moments, playing the game till it's over
Perfect strangers, perfection isn't obtained by
Momentary gain or, voluntary pain
Martyr your heart condition, sacrifice all your possessions
It's burning up in flames with violent aggression causing depression
Right this moment a women gets raped, there's no escape
The flesh flashed in his face fed his rage
On every tv station and magazine page
We keep falling (to temptation) cause this is how we're raised
I don't expect every line to make sense at first mention
That's why with this album I recommend repeated listens
My flow isn't the illest, my content isn't the sickest
These visions are to specific, I'm bringing you something different

Right this Moment, what's going on?
Step outside, turn on your tv, turn on the radio
Blaow, coming through your speaker right now
Music is more then just a style
Right this Moment, what's going on?
Step outside, turn on your tv, turn on your radio
Blaow, coming through your speaker worldwide
To many shades of grey, time to make it black and white

Right this moment, another rapper gets shot
You'd act surprised, but there's something you forgot
We reap what we sew, each lyric is a seed
Guns ain't killing rock stars, they only murder mcs
Many lives lost, stolen by bullets blasted out chambers
A clear and present danger, playing the game till it's over
It's all fun and games until someone gets hurt
Might just start shooting ourselves like Kurt, (for what it's worth)
Right this moment, soldiers invade foreign territory
Tear it down and bring terror to their family
I can't say if it's wrong or justified, I'm just a man who stands
Between behind the scene secrets, so I admit I have a weekness
We can sit and argue about, who's right and who's wrong
Who's good and who's evil, the discussion goes on and on
All I know is, (right this moment) I can make a difference in this world
Sit and watch it get worse or work to make it more secure
