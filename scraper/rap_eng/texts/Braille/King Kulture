[Hook: Lee Green]
Ooooo
Ooooo(Yeah!! Yeah!!)
He's The King of all creation!!

[Verse 1: Braille]
A collective reflecting the inaccessible light
Expressing the excellent essence of Christ
Words echo in the trenches where trespassers
Tremble in fright consider this a preemptive strike
The Eminent saving the remnant from every nation and tribe
Makin' our faith alive before we vaporize from the fatal eyes
We're split in the wilderness
In the middle of a war, so take sides
It's psychotic to stand against a true God
With a straight jacket on and yo shoes untied
Your mind is gone, but so is mine
I saw the signs, cuz the sovereign Lord is kind
And that's why I draw the line between
Raps I used to write, talkin' bout myself
But now, um, self must die, set aside, sayo-nara
Tomorrow's not promised, on the gospel I'm dependent
For salvation, it's a privilege to proclaim and defend it!

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Theory Hazit]
Ayo, the end times lessons are three:
Beware, the worst is near
Open up your third eye, listen with ya third ear
It's like a thriller video, evil is lurkin'
So I link with the same power that took the feet from the serpent
Satan got tricks up his sleeve and is workin'
But ain't it funny how a King could step in
Defeatin' his purpose, leavin' him nervous
Send me to be in His curtains
I'll lead the people to worship Him: Royal, loving, and merciful
He's the King of the culture

[Verse 3: Odd Thomas]
You were the influence for centuries but left Babylon
Escaped from a eminence and ran from the very hill we built upon
With the rapture round the corner
And the world clock winding down
Christians abandon position and wait for the "trumpet sound"
Mister "elephant in the room" assuming you use intelligence
We lose because we privately engaging but socially irrelevant
We become the evangelical ghetto developin' our own lingo
So the church becomes isolated, and God incognito
So while you're separatin' sacred from secular and miss ya chance
To advance the kingdom of God, because they disrespectin' you
It's time we capture the heart, not to censor it
But become a mentor to it, speak to it
And stay true to it, only to restore through it
And wave the banner in a manner that's not only possible
To redeem the influence on the culture
But at the same time present the gospel

[Hook]

[Verse 4: Lee Green]
They said the blast did it but wait a minute
Who infinite invented in the beginning in His image minds
And men and women before ceiling could limit it to the shire
And blemish his desire render it as crime and [?]
To benefit the swine and fill in the divine
Militant resign repent and then refine
Because we've been and died
And watch His Word make us all new
Because we in a bind we down her praising dust
Cause they spit a rhyme
Before L, Christ rocked bells through dinner time
Break through, fought down at the scrimmage line
Every culture ask the throne for a sip of wine
Intertwined in the vine, blood-bought orphans
Freedom rings, the lawyer called to drop the charges
And at the cross is where the judge saw they swapped the corpses
Every color is in his hand like a box of markers
The Rock is gorgeous, tidal wives couldn't stop applauses

[Hook]
