Poison
You're eatin' me alive with these lies
Eatin' me, you're eatin' me alive with these lies, lies
With these lies, eatin' me, you're eating me alive
Poison
You're eatin' me alive with these lies
Eatin' me, you're eatin' me alive with these lies, lies
Eatin' me alive with these lies, you're eating me alive

[Verse 1]
And I believed the lie before you lied to me
The irony that I would be to blind to see
Yeah saw it in my diary
I knew it all along but I'm human and I'm wrong
I just want to control
I'm such a liability moved by epiphanies
Made up my mind and I refuse to see it differently
Prophetic when I said it so the message was embedded
But I always make exceptions to the rule I don't regret it
Instead of walkin' away with a hard heart
Lots of anger lots of frustration rage like danger danger
The opposite is true grace compassion and truth
After everything that happened bad habits and distractions
It's hard to imagine all the coulda woulda shoulda
But what would it be to this is not my hope
So I repent for the events that have taken place
And I ate enough poison that I recognize the taste

Poison
You're eatin' me alive with these lies
Eatin' me, you're eatin' me alive with these lies, lies
With these lies, eatin' me, you're eating me alive
Poison
You're eatin' me alive with these lies
Eatin' me, you're eatin' me alive with these lies, lies
Eatin' me alive with these lies, you're eating me alive

[Verse 2]
In the last four years I shed more tears than I'd like to admit
But I also shed my skin that revealed that I'm a serpent
I hate snakes crawlin' on they bellies
Don't tell me that I got that in my character trait
I see the scales on my face
And I'm fightin' it no that's not me
It never has been but that's when it kicks me like a ton of bricks
Like I deserved the punishment the wrath of God
I tried to laugh it off
But I can neither stand in judgment or stand in awe
For moments when I couldn't stand at all
Collapsing in perhaps it was caused from trying to hold it in
When something is wrong but you don't know what it is
With a blind fold try to pin the tail on a donkey
Is it you or is it me?
Who's responsible for this?
It's impossible to guess
So I'm left in unrest for the moments I wept
Kept your dirty little secrets
Which only made it harder to put together the pieces
And know I see it
A clear picture
That this path was here for me to walk down
An instrument used to break me down
So I could be broken over my own sin
And not be subject to the lies
Spoken inward and out would the outcome is out of my hands
The thought that my plans could succeed on my own without God
What a total facade
