[Intro: Propaganda]
Can you turn this up real quick
So here's a celebration for you guys who have been through a lot of ugly things
And the Lord somehow brought you to where you are now
And all you can do now is be involved in this goodness
Am I right, check it out

[Verse 1: Propaganda]
Yeah, cause I remember karaoke mics pointed at the speaker
Boom box play the tracks, CD skipped, bunch of raps
Open mics, night side, drive by ghetto bird
Hoping you can make it home
Better get swift with your words
Birthplace, earthquake
Hometown; it goes down
Learn to bust choppers before your ABC, tragedy
Survivor rivals the odds of tryin’ to fight gravity
A compliment when MC say come battle me, stay cool
Now a dad, college grad, quit my job, hit the road
Tryin’ to get my marriage happy
Ask about me at the bottom of the 710, holding down the sea port
Beach city, coast guard, Queen Mary, Snoop Lion
Trust me, I'm a native, the Hollywood sign be lyin' beneath it
Grave of a thousand young souls, take a stroll on a sure dream of Californication
And I still can't explain how any of us made it
It's grace

[Hook: Andy Mineo & Propaganda]
And I got a feeling I can't describe
I see this place when I close my eyes
Wake me up if we ever arrive
And tell me how did we
How did we get here?
Tell me how did we (You can do better than that)
How did we get here?
Tell me how did we
How did we get here?
Tell me how did we
How did we get here?
Tell me

[Verse 2: Propaganda]
We'd be waving palm branches
People with second chances
Coal train love [?]
Half [?] the things that there ain't no
People would turn back things I can't grow
Runnin' tables telling stories of young decisions
More like who'd you rather be
2Pac, Biggie, Beatles or Rolling Stones
Kobe, Lebron, [?] or Jordan it's all [?]
[?] I prolly ain't [?]
[?] homie I can walk with
One of us is [?]
Homie the Divine did it
Another [?] who never lost his accent
Google it
[?] option, but thanks for the celebration
On every stage I stand on
Oh, before [?] don't let me stumble you
If it's on Jeter the next one's on me
It's a good day

[Hook: Andy Mineo & Propaganda]
And I got a feeling I can't describe
I see this place when I close my eyes
So wake me up if we ever arrive
And tell me how did we
How did we get here?
Tell me how did we (You can do better than that)
How did we get here? (I don't even know)
Tell me how did we
How did we get here?
Tell me how did we
How did we get here?
Tell me

[Interlude: Propaganda]
Sometimes you just need to take a step back and give in to all His goodness
I really don't have an answer except for the Lord is gracious
So if you ever get in that position
Take that moment
You can ask yourself "How did we get here"
Let me tell you what I learned though

[Verse 3: Propaganda]
And I learned you ain't in love with this
Time to fire your publicist, I inspire above the mess
Your desire requires this lost angels city, don't pity us, fully aware
That's why I don't flinch at a bully scare

[Outro: Propaganda]
That's us trying to be pretty with our music
