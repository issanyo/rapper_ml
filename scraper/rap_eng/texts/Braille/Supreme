[Verse 1: shai linne]
Let me start this off with a, "Hallelujah" to Jesus, the sovereign ruler
This is not a rumor, got the truth so we about to school ya
Check how the style maneuvers, shout it to you like the loudest roofers
Christ brought us up from out the sewer, we don't have to doubt the future
Craftin' our verses as we bask in His worship
You askin' the purpose? Partly to snatch cats from the furnace
Through Jesus' extravagant service, immaculate purchase
He was smashin' the serpent and we only scratchin' the surface

[Verse 2: Braille]
He's the seed that was conceived in the womb of a virgin
The Son emerges in a manger while the angels serenade Him
It's the birth of the Saviour, the great I Am became a man
Came as a lamb and would be executed to execute the plan
A substitute to stand, in the place of the wicked
On the cross, He was lifted, but we considered Him stricken and afflicted
Just like the prophets predicted, He came at the proper moment
To stop His opponent and lay down His life to offer atonement

[Verse 3: Odd Thomas]
He's the most magnificent, the total antithesis of insufficient
The blessed, the glorious, splendid, transcendent
Difficult to comprehend, independent of space and time but presently present, suspending the heavens with speech
From coast to coast, He speaks peace to wind and seas
Got heavenly hosts easily posted on bended knees
Controls the cosmos with the most authority
So we boast in the most exalted King, Christ supreme!

[Verse 4: shai linne]
He's the sovereign thriller, the awesome healer, the Law-fulfiller
The Sodom-killer, the fraud revealer, no god is realer
When you're taking your time in the Scripture, what you get is a prominent picture
See His light shining bright in the night and His frightening might in a dominant mixture
See, His name had all the renown, though, when He came for the lost that He found low
He was tame, didn't floss all around, but remained from the manger to the cross to the crown, yo
Satan had a choke-hold on Him, Christ pulled the rope-a-dope and then
R, to the I, to the S, to the E, to the N, that's what we hopin' in!

[Verse 5: Braille]
Risen on the spell check, the Risen King can rinse clean
The most rebellious, I was hell-bound, now I’m spellbound
Word is bond, I’m a bondservant to the Word of life
Call me a sellout, I was bought with a price
We got a hope that won’t fail us when we return to the dust
We will rise up just like the One who justified us
It’s not wishful thinking, when the truth sink in, we are clinging
To the promises of God bringing an everlasting kingdom

[Verse 6: Odd Thomas]
Nothing can compare to the worth of what we inherited
Nothing in Heaven and Earth can measure what Christ merited
The skies declare the affairs of His glorious care
The God who is there, who's aware, who delights in our prayer
His purposes are permanent and perfectly proportionate
Everything that orbits around His glory's subordinate
He is the most excellent One, intrinsic, infinite Son
Preeminent, the name Par Excellence, prénom phenomenon

[Verse 7: shai linne]
He’s beyond phenomenon, you see, the Father of Cosmology
The Abba of Astronomy, He’s Potter, we are pottery
It’s shocking, Jesus died for me, the Father, He adopted me
And constantly provides for me, whether or not I got degrees
You gotta see His odyssey: From sovereignty and lottery
To poverty and robbery to resurrected bodily
Apocalyptic prophecy: He’s stopping all the mockery
And scholarly snobbery that don’t acknowledge Him properly

[Verse 8: Braille]
You ought to be on bended knee before the Preeminent
It’s awfully arrogant to reject  Him to your detriment
Study the development from Old to New Testament
You’ll find a theme that’s prevalent, from age to age, it’s relevant
Christ is on the center stage, forget religious sentiments
That center on man, for something less is what you’re settling
He is the most excellent, exercising benevolence
And blessing a remnant with the benefits of His inheritance

[Verse 9: Odd Thomas]
The sin of sinners that separated and segregated
That severed the relations between man and his Maker
And placed Christ on His costly cross and compensated
His life, death and resurrection, emancipated and gave us
Freedom from it all, freedom from the effects of the Fall
Freedom from Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden and from the Law
So the saints stand and applaud His grace and glorious cause
With hands raised, praisin' His name, singin' “Glory to God”!
