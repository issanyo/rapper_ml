[Verse 1: Sean Little]
A conscious consumer pays no mind to obnoxious rumors
Lays low, time an obstacle to maneuver
Optical is lunar, prophet and profitable is possible a pursuer
And doer to skewer manure in the sewer so it'll lure fewer
And fewer will mature to the truer
Conclude get a clue, curb your enthusiasm
Proving passion isn't a looming distraction
Illuminating on the path when
So few are creating on the past tense
When rap meant action not a mass trend
A labyrinth of elaborate lavish distraction
To keep my mind on my money, money on the mind
Pacify the passive laughing like it's funny all the time
Ratify the active saying something in they rhyme
And I strategize with braille for the blind

[Hook]
The way I bust like just might blow your mind
Said it might blow your mind
Cause I can trust I must try fail adjust fly
And it blows my mind
From the dust to a rhyme and the rust of the grind
Man this stuff blows my mind
Don't give up on the climb, touch the skyline
And it just might blow your mind

[Verse 2: Braille]
Let me start from the beginning, the first inning inning
The birth of a child on this Earth spinning spinning
Before I could talk, had to first listen
Take the baby steps, now I write a verse and spit it
With words of wisdom but where did they come from from
I used to feel like my life was hum drum drum
Run of the mill, just another young dumb dumb
Searching for the thrill cause my heart was so numb
None of this made sense back then
I'm speaking past tense, looking back with a cracked lens
Eyes wide shut, look how my life lined up
I was attracted to the hip-hop with rhymes and cuts
The kind I love, I could never find enough
Had to try it on my own before my time was up
I had no assumption of what it would lead to
If you told me back then, I wouldn't believe you

[Hook]
The way I bust like just might blow your mind
Said it might blow your mind
Cause I can trust I must try fail adjust fly
And it blows my mind
From the dust to a rhyme and the rust of the grind
Man this stuff blows my mind
Don't give up on the climb, touch the skyline
And it just might blow your mind

[Verse 3: Sean Little]
If I would have know then what I know now
No way no how, make a brother slow down
Heart cold frost like Jack
Thought like black for I fall right back
What a brother believe, I was not taught like that
Anyone other than me a thought like that
Is what I think I thought, blink brought
Before me the Glory the ink taught
Who are we gnarly, not partly entirely
This little light of mine only star in me
Not a part or a piece apart from Me
Me a part of the tree, particle leaves
Parson to party peeps who hardly believe
Arson to arguing over arbitrary
Which only adds to the army of the Larson chief
Harming by charm and deceit
Tell by the fruit who was farming the tree
Consider yourself warned by bars and a beat

[Hook]
The way I bust like just might blow your mind
Said it might blow your mind
Cause I can trust I must try fail adjust fly
And it blows my mind
From the dust to a rhyme and the rust of the grind
Man this stuff blows my mind
Don't give up on the climb, touch the skyline
And it just might blow your mind
