Verse 1 [Ozay Moore]

Othello’s the name ya’all surely can trust, so make it easy to let me lead it's a must/
I , promise to make it real good for your soul, moment to moment showing how the moments can grow/
Into and experience you hold till you're old, and , pass down as a see you can sow/
Into the youth as proof they can know, better times let it ride imma glide to it slow, like so/

This is a moment here to be free in ya soul, and if you can't let go,you stay froze and never grow/
So now you've heard it twice and as nice as it seems, you continue to dream but never drink from the stream/
And live life to the fullest so, if your with it ,and you dig it, you can get if you let it soak catch the message and react to it, yeah ya’all/
