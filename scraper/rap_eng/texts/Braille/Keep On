9-1-1 wasn't a joke
Pistols blaze, young guns get lost in the smoke
There's a war going on between the rich and the broke
It's in the streets, worldwide, overseas and under oath
From day one man was flawed, we fall daily
No man is perfect, word, but we can keep working
Fulfill our purpose, before we're gone with the wind
Storing treasures for the final days and focus on the end (result)
The vinyl plays and I write, my minds stays in the light
And sprays a rhyme to ignite freedom
I'm feeling like it's all over
Standing in the cold to be reminded that I'm still breathing
And I'm leaving this state of mind that got me depressed
All the desires of the flesh, get put to rest
And understand, we can live free in harsh reality
And shine light, when it's to dark to see
Keep on, sun rise to sun fall
Get your back up off the wall and keep
Keep on, we in this together, good and bad weather
Only the soul lasts forever
Keep on, sun rise to sun fall
Get your back up off the wall and keep
Keep on, focus on the permanent things
We can't always trust what we see

I'm taking shots at the system like a paparazzi
You can't stop me, from operating properly
I'm set to prosper with no illegal scandal
Just honest, diligent hard work, I can't stand still
I call my cash cream, it's not about the benjamin's
My cream is medicine, I'm not afraid to spread it thin
Bless a struggling family with some food to eat
I know if in reverse, they would do it for me
I'm looking out for my people in these trife (trifle) times
Children play outside and put their life on the line
It's not all bad, but it's been seeming so lately
Seeing all these teenage girls raising babies
With no fathers, subliminal manslaughter
Young bucks on the block sipping dirty bath water
In glass bottles, feeling betrayed and cursed
Stay encouraged, the last shall be first, I'm saying

Keep on, sun rise to sun fall
Get your back up off the wall and keep
Keep on, we in this together, good and bad weather
Only the soul lasts forever
Keep on, sun rise to sun fall
Get your back up off the wall and keep
Keep on, focus on the permanent things
We can't always trust what we see

Goliath strikes and stands larger then my shadow is
I'm not equipt to battle this man handler alone
Built on the rock, evil infiltrates my home
And I'm to honest to God to cast the first stone
Fear factor got me thinking to turn, run the opposite way
Options fade, opposition tossing grenades
I'm not trained in the art of war
I'm not running wild chasing beef, like a carnivore
Sometimes I feel like giving up
Sometimes I feel like it's not worth the fight
Sometimes I feel like nobody cares
Cried at night and realized, God was right there
So regardless of what's see with physical eyes
(deep inside) I know there's meaning to life
And even when I'm feeling down, defiled, defeated and dry
I can still lift my hands to the sky (keep on)
