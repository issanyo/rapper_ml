[Verse 1]
Meet little Miss So & So, sitting right over there
Rolling her eyes, blowing her bubble gum, and twisting up her hair
Showing her thighs in her miniskirt, she's quite aware
She's a pro at this she knows it when she's setting up her snare

She's quite accomplished in the tricks of the trade
Her mama's boyfriend taught her everything when she hit the 6th grade
He violated her and said he couldn't help the assault
Her mama hated her for tempting him and held her at fault

Their were lots of men who befriended her mother
And to little Miss So & So, some were friendlier than others
She wanted a father figure but got parasitic lovers
They drained her of her spirit and she never did quite recover

She's having a hell of a time dealing with being a shell of a girl
Trying to fit in with the smiling faces of an irrelevant world
You know you're lost when the demon of lust
Is the only one you think you can trust

[Chorus]
She's not a prostitute, she just wears the uniform
She's been hurt by so many she doesn't quite know who to scorn
Trying to find love by sleeping around, she's hunting unicorn
But mommy did the same thing, so she's staying true to form

She likes to go fast, likes to shop for romance
Doesn't think she's worthy of some flowers and a slow dance
There's a boy she knows who wants to walk around and hold hands
Sorry to break it to you brother, but you ain't got no chance

[Verse 2]
She walks the halls of her high school
Looking for the bad boys, passing up the nice fools
She spends more time under the bleachers than the classroom
Even met one of her teachers in the bathroom

Flushing her education right down the drain
She's got a reputation that she's gotta try and maintain
Her clothes are barely painted on, she's in the skimpiest dress mode
The principal sits her down, trying to stress the dress code

She hears the whispers pointed toward her locker
About her visit to the clinic and the abortion doctor
Last week, when she said she was in her room with the flu
Gossip hurts just as much when the rumors are true

She wishes it was her instead of the fetus that died
She portrays confidence but she's defeated inside
She sees the hurt coming but instead of running away
She just grabs the nearest boy and gets straight to numbing the pain

[Chorus]
She's not a prostitute, she just wears the uniform
She's been hurt by so many she doesn't quite know who to scorn
Trying to find love by sleeping around, she's hunting unicorn
But mommy did the same thing, so she's staying true to form

She likes to go fast, likes to shop for romance
Doesn't think she's worthy of some flowers and a slow dance
There's a boy she knows who likes to walk around and hold hands
Sorry to break it to you brother, but you ain't got no chance

[Verse 3]
Walking home at 2 AM after staring at a stranger's ceiling
She feels something tugging away at her she's just not used to feeling
Something that drops her to her knees on the sidewalk
And makes her want to lay down and get outlined in white chalk

She's so angry, she's so bitter
The shame and the pain and betrayal, it all hit her
She screams out as she's digging her nails into her palms
Then a door opens up wide, instantly she's calm

She sees a man, he's walking toward her
He tells her to stand and she's good at taking orders
She rises to her feet and prepares for the worst
He says "Here's a glass of water, I can tell that you thirst"

He saw a little girl, not a filthy whore
She drank that water like she'd never tasted it before
He smiled at her and she knew right there and then
That she never in her life wanted to be thirsty again
