[Intro]
So what they gon' say about us, huh?
Early 21st century, humanity, when history tells the truth
America on the brink of war, with three countries consecutively
And the church?
Well, one part was making reality shows about decadence
And the other?
Man, they wrote blogs about how the first part was wrong
And the rest?
Well, they ain’t have running water
Or the governmental right to practice their faith
So they just died off
They say our nation is on it’s way to hell
As if it’s ever been in Heaven In the first place
It’s time to REDEEM time

[Verse 1]
He be morphin’ the pimp, hustler, and rapist to co-laborers
And them muy mal female canines, come see the change in ‘em
It relates to the laymen, our mistakes ain’t go to waste, boy
The Redeemer did just that then sent us right back to ya
Huh, Wake up, come join the winning circle and come hang wit us
Swoop through, we stroll as royalty in full regalia
And don’t love the old us that’s pitiful necrophilia
The nasty made clean, there’s no rewind just redeem

[Hook]
It’s such a fortunate failure
And tossed into that sea of forgetfulness
Redeem, redeem
Helpless to change our past
But great was Elohim to redeem, redeem
There’s no rewind
Just redeem, redeem

[Verse 2]
It’s pieces of perfect symphony
A Mozart of irony
The Vincent Van Gogh that only paints with serendipity
He be dippin’ His brushes into messy blotches of coincidences
And attackin’ that canvas like every splatter had a destiny
Broaden y’all’s lenses a little wider you’d see that perfect symmetry
Redeemed
Boy, it’s all on purpose
I’m still off on purpose
My Papi takes the worthless
And brandishes a stamp of one-of-a-kind and priceless
A cosmic thrift shopper, Macklemore could only imagine
Buyin’ stuff He made Himself from dust and words
In other words: us
And this is all my confidence for the 626 and the Exodus
If you certain you was blood purchased
Please come stand wit us

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Lee Green]
My dad was a preacher and a doctor
But with me he didn't bother
Section 8 was momma's wisdom
How we’d sleep but it was warmer
I would grieve, I would dishonor
I would speak but it was drama
Sleep while she was workin' harder
So that we could make it further
Failed school or smoke the money, guilt I'm sweeping on my father
As if his absence was reason for making my momma a weeping martyr
My efforts sandcastles that just wait for beaching waters
Until I heard who wrote my life, and saw that Jesus was the author
See, a bastard is robed in curses
What man has disposed as worthless
God chose to bestow a purpose
His show’s when they close the curtains
He blows on His coals of words, in our bellies they glow a furnace
The soul of a person that knows that he’s purchased will explode in worship
I hear stories that have passed, His invitations
Trash the antiques, past parade a pageant of his graces
Epistles of bone believe his blood is active validation
Weigh your faults against the cross and see who has enough to pay them

[Hook]
