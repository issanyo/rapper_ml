[Intro: Gabriella Winchester]
Yo Yo
What's up ya'll?
This is Gabriella
And you are listening to Native Lungs with Braille Brizzy
Whoop Whoop

[Hook: Braille]
West coast native
West coast native
West coast native

[Verse 1: Braille]
I was born 1981
September 22nd
First born son
Got my feet wet in the city of rain
Learned how to walk, on the muddy terrain
Used my tape decks to study the rap game
Been around for a while seen a lot of things change
This is my native land
Language I understand
Before I made records I was a fan
I was in the east coast mostly
The Lifesavers were my favourite group locally
2000 Cream Team with the speakers on max
And the DJ would scratch with his sneakers on his hands man
You could find me in the front row
With the 'double X' clothes on
Pockets full of paper that I wrote on
Always had rhymes with me
That's how I know how to write them so quickly

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Braille]
Where was I?
Let me pick up where I left off
A few years after 'Hammer Pants' and 'Kriss Kross'
I took it serious
Notebook
Pencil lead
Flow go with the beat like a needle and thread
Needle to the record freestyling in my room
No audience
Letting the bass go boom
For the love of it
And that's the native lung of it
Back then never knew what would become of it
Before I had my drivers licence
I was analysing who could rhyme the nicest
Shy and silent
But something inside was rising
Each step got more surprising

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Braille]
Yeah, I learned the hard way, nobody told me how
Kept flowing even though I had a sloppy style
Didn't know how to count my bars right
Must have learned how to play my cards right
So many MC's light-years ahead of me
What can I do that hasn't been done already
Not much I'm a novice in this
Made mistakes I can't go back and fix it
I was wicked never sought forgiveness
Never thought I'd write rhymes with the Gospel in it
I'm not the 'El Capitan' or lieutenant
Things never panned how I planned I admit it
Thank God I repented
I was so foolish
I thought I could get saved by the music
But he chose me
That's a lot to take in
And that's how the story begins
Let's get it in
