[Verse 1: Eshon Burgundy]
Yo
Some of the most unfortunate events have taken place inside my brain
I try to condense but it expands when I explain
And that may sound intense but that's just agony and pain
That I casually contain
But magically it change
When I'm in front of everybody yo
I laugh and joke but I'd rather just go hang out in the lobby doe
Somebody asked me if I was paranoid one day
I guess it come off that way after seeing so much gun play
Post traumatic stress disorder
I don't know but I guess so, sorta
Man especially when I had my first daughter
And I ain't have a clue of what I could possibly do to support her
My pride kept me outta Burger King, “May I take ya order?”
The Lord'll provide even though I'm living my life less organized
An example of grace not an excuse to make mistakes
I'm not abusing my faith I'm just concluding what it takes
And that space is reserved for the One who died in my place
That burden get on my nerves
Burden give me the shakes
That burden is heavy weight
That burden'll make me break
And me giving it all away
Is me learnin to levitate
Instead of a ski mask on my face
I'm just off in a better place
Let's pray

[Hook: Liz Vice]
I know I’m set free when I feel trapped
Can’t let it live, gotta kill that
No matter how hopeless
I can’t deny that
There’s a calm blue sky over Iraq
So there’s hope
There’s hope

[Verse 2: Eshon Burgundy]
Yeah, to be honest, I can't do nothing but believe the promise
No fronting
I'm just stuck on something only He can accomplish
I mean, the streets is in me deep
See, I done seen too much
So when things get tough, it’s screaming to be released
And if I'm not preoccupied, those demons can be increased
That's verse 45, chapter 12 of Matthew
The least of my troubles
When I entertain the speech of the devil
So I remain in reach of the Father
Who applies heat to the kettle
So I scream
When I blow off steam
Then I’m settled
Reminded of the power in that Name
Then I'm leveled
Still embezzlin my dreams
Negligent of my schemes I know Heaven intervenes
When I war with spiritual things
Ignore amphetamines when I'm offered the better things
No substitute for the truth and that
Truth is He never change
Simple and plain I'm a man
And I ain't got it all together
I need His Son
I need His Spirit
And I need 'em all forever
Good grief

[Hook]

[Hook 2: Liz Vice]
My eyes are on the sky above
Where the fire can’t climb high enough
I’m focused on the sky above
Where the problems can’t fly high enough
