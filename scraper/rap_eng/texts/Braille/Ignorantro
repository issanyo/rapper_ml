[Verse]
After that a supernatural disaster just happened to happen
What's happenin'?
Let's get it crackin'
Y'all better have faith
Got a habit of takin' your place on your homie's tablet as his favorite rapper
Matter fact, matter fact the only rapper
Last May, seen a Jackpot link and they hit play
Went to Google Play you was history that day
Sorted it by genre, Hip-Hop, he had J
Added Nevada's assassin like mathematics
Both sides black-ish
Old fish burn when it's rainin' acid
No chance for all you rappers
Subtracted your track and deleted the cache
Delete it for no reason, you seen he had mad space
Like chin-to-brim of your hat space when you fill it with that face, backspace
Oh they mad? Oh they bad?
Don't say that, take it back?
I need you to have grace
He don't really listen to rapping
Give him compassion as he's cleanin' out his trash with the track on your last tape
Sucka MC, Jan 15th, King day
King of Kings day, freedom at last is first place
Hashtag SameTeam for the direction
Verily, verily, not necessarily with the craft, aye
Imitation cheddar gets shredded sharpen your edits
Learn a lesson when I reverse the subject and predicate
Get your raps up, matter of fact
Stand up two feet on the shoulders of Shaq, bruh
With a Sharpie and a pen and a pad write a rap
Write every, simile, metaphor, imagery
Pattern and the description of the persona we're witnessing
As if these things
Aren't just elephants sipping tea
In a studio apartment restartin' a sippin' spree
The thirst of poverty's kitchen sink
Ooh, you're mimicking, dead it
All y'all pens unleaded
I record at headquarters in Portland, Oregon, check it
And they don't gas much but, homie, you gassed up
Oh, I think they like me
Oh, I think they unliked me
Oh, I think they gon' unlike me
If I was you I would be my favorite rapper
And my favorite rapper's favorite rapper
The rapper every rapper is afraid to rap after
I'm the latest, I'm the greatest
I'm the underrated, I'm the undebated
I'm the one who made it, I'm the one who famous
I'm the one who's on Humble Beast, I'm the one who came through
I'm the one who comes from the East to the West
See, I'm the one to do it
I'm the one that's fluid
I'm the one that's freestylin' just to do it
On the album too
