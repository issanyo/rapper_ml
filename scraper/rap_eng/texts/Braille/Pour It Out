I've soaked it all in, now I want to pour it out
I've soaked it all in, now I want to pour it out

I XXX on a soul train in downtown Philly
Sat back in my seat and soaked in the city
Fell asleep and then the train stopped running
So I walked the streets until the sun rose again
It was unfamiliar territory abandon and a few cars driving by
And people on the corner standing
They didn?t acknowledge me so I did the same back
Plus it was so dark I tried to stay on track
Following the street lights so I can see ahead of me
Avoiding the dark alleys and probably pass them plenty
Where situation could have been deadly
But I wasn't a treat to no one just moving alone steady

I've soaked it all in, now I want to pour it out
I've soaked it all in, now I want to pour it out

I had no clock so time was a guessing game
I want to go where? nobody knows my name
XXX XXX's fighting... I wonder who will win
I'll check the results tomorrow on channel 10
I saw this girl who looked like a supermodel
XXX on a runway she's running away
Standing in one place a car pulled beside her
We made eye contact, but neither of us smiled
It started raining
I've tried to block it out in my mind in the sky with some dark clouds
And then I recognize how I miss being home
But even there is no different than this
Surrounded by things that I can't change
Or maybe I could? if I wasn't searching for the next train

I've soaked it all in, now I want to pour it out
I've soaked it all in, now I want to pour it out

I was just walking talking to myself
Somebody asked for change? I didn't hesitate to help
Reached in my pocket... but there was nothing there
He looked at me as if I didn't really care
I just kept moving? the city seemed so alive, but I felt so dead inside
So I figured I was hungry? now I'm asking for change
Sometimes we?re so different then we become the same
The city moved faster as the sun started to rise
I wasn't tired or hungry... just wanted to catch a ride
But at this point I was lost and confused and I didn't wanted
To leave cuz that?s what I always do
Never around to do something significant
Just watching from the distance and soaking it in
And that?s why I'm always getting on a train
But this time I won't ever be the same...

I wish I could make your problems go away, but I can't even do that with my own
So that?s why I'm getting on a train... searching for a place called home
I wish I could make your problems go away, but I can't even do that with my own
I think this time I'm going to stay and pour out what I've soaked in

I've soaked it all in, now I want to pour it out
I've soaked it all in, now I want to pour it out

I've soaked it all in, now I want to pour it out
I've soaked it all in, now I want to pour it out
