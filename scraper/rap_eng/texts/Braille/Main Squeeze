Everything's gonna be alright
Ask Alicia, my girl is a queen like Latifah
Nice to meet ya, I'm not a creeper
So if I dance in your radius I'm not trying to freak ya
I don't live single, I mingle with the ring on
Tied the knot in 02' until infinity beyond
I'm light years ahead of you player, I don't play games
I won't take back my words like it's my last name
Innocent until proven, word to Chief Wiggum
Call my raps Sugar Smacks and all ya'll Dig Em'
The track gets composed on the MP
Nobody seeing this, who's on the boards, check the fingerprints
88 keys drop the 808 bass, cause it's 2008 and I got something to say
Hey rappers, hey judgment day, bad news

Are you my main squeeze?

I wanna squeeze you
I wanna hold you tight
That's what I want to do

I'm not a drinking man, I'm more like a thinking man
I think out loud they say, "Boy watch your mouth!"
Yo man if you got something to say, let it out
Don't hold your breath, it's like hey
The world should know this and also take notice that
I'm not afraid to get on stage and share emotions
The more I put in it the harder I rock
And the harder I rock the harder they jock
Radio disk jockeys on their high horses
Whipping the listeners, keep running the same track
The playlist is more like a paylist
But my songs are on from DJs who only play favorites
