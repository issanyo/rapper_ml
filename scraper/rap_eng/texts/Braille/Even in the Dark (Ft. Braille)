[Verse 1: Dillon Chase]
A fiery furnace I've come to no gain
Turn the heat up like propane I'm pro pain
That means I'm for the struggle
I don't shun the hurt
You can destroy and crumble
All of my fumbled works
I feel like I'm under dirt
And the casket is sealed
Laboring fruitless vineyards collapsing the field
I'm asking myself
Now the fact is revealed
Trying to justify myself
Living backwards for real
But God uses the darkness
To make me more sensitive to the spark- lit
When the light of the gospel charges
In on my heart covered in dark tint
I recognize that the light's there
God, rescue me from this nightmare
This depression never fights fair, might fail
I'm terrified, paralyzed, in a tight snare
But even still

[Chorus]
Even in the dark, I know you are God
Even in the dark I know who you are
'Cus even in the dark you are light
Even in my wrong you are right
Even in the dark, I know you are God
Even in the dark I know who you are
'Cus even in the dark you are light
Even in my wrong you are right

[Verse 2: Braille]
I came from the domain of darkness
Walking with no sight
There were no shadows in the night
No light to give shape, substance, or form
To this tattered and torn place I was born, darkness
Not the face of the earth but the state of my heart
It was a statement of dark hatred for God
Loving the darkness rather than the light
This is where I feel at home
And this world where I roam
Born breaking the law
Believing my own right
Getting further from the truth
'Cause if I fail to love God then I'm a murderer too
Guilty of it all
Didn't even know it
Couldn't pay the penalty once I realized I owed it
I was hopeless
The light came in the world, the world would reject him
From the cross to the grave
Now in heaven resurrected
So I'm walking through the dark in the light of his grace
And I can only stand because he stood in my place

[Dillon Chase]
(My God lightens my darkness)

[Chorus]
Even in the dark, I know you are God
Even in the dark I know who you are
'Cus even in the dark you are light
Even in my wrong you are right
Even in the dark, I know you are God
Even in the dark I know who you are
'Cus even in the dark you are light
Even in my wrong you are right

[Verse 3: Dillon Chase]
Yeah, I'm well acquainted with this dark haze
Need to be elevated from my heartache
I've got pain, deadened by disappointment
Wondering what the point is
Wishing I could avoid this
Have you ever received news that removed the ground from underneath you?
And that light that used to lead you leaves you when you got nothing to cling to
It isn't true darkness isn't dark to him
He's in a prison of affliction you can call him friend
The light vanished because you turned your face
Eyes closed face down in the dirt not observing grace
This is the perfect place to get a fresh wind
Press in until he leaves an impression
Don't let sin dominate the flesh
When the light of the world is your Lord and your best friend

[Outro]
Even in the dark, I know you are God
Even in the dark I know who you are
'Cus even in the dark you are light
Even in my wrong you are right
Even in the dark, I know you are God
Even in the dark I know who you are
'Cus even in the dark you are light
Even in my wrong you are right
Even in the dark, I know you are God
Even in the dark I know who you are
'Cus even in the dark you are light
Even in my wrong you are right
Even in the dark, I know you are God
Even in the dark I know who you are
'Cus even in the dark you are light
Even in my wrong you are right
