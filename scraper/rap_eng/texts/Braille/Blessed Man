I feel so blessed yall
This track is incredible
S one
You can feel it
I'm a blessed man
Yes man, I'm a blessed man
Right now, I'm a blessed man
No question, I'm a blessed man
You can feel it, so much joy

It's like a dream come true
A sneak preview of the grand finale
I get a taste of heaven, it's like milk and honey
I was blessed with love before I had money
The things I love most, you can't take from me
I hold them close, the Most High and my family
I might never get fortune and fame
I'm always gonna say I've been a fortunate man

And when they ask who I am, I will stand up and say I'm a blessed man
And when they ask where I'm at, it doesn't matter, I'm with you, I'm a blessed man
And when they ask why, I will point to the sky, I'm a blessed man
Yeah, yes man I'm a blessed man
Yes man I'm a blessed man

We walked through the park holding hands
And I'm thinking to myself I'm a blessed man
You're so beautiful the words escape me
Like the day I watched you give birth to our baby
You illuminate when I'm in a dark place
Bless my heart with a smile on your face
I'ma say it, my wife is hot
So it don't matter how much ice I got
I put a ring on her finger, leave it at that
If it wasn't for her I wouldn't be where I'm at
If it wasn't for God maybe we never would have met
But He brought us together so there's no question we're blessed
I don't write many love songs, I'm sorry girl
The truth is I never hear beats worthy of it
But when the glove fits I let the world know
I'm married to an angel and plan to stay faithful

As I sit back reflecting
It's obvious that my life's been protected
I had friends get murdered
I could have been there
Friends committed suicide
I could have went there
Depression, my life could have ended
I could have took a flight on September 11th
Life is fragile, we take it for granted
I'm thankful for the life I was handed
Christ stretched out His arms on the cross
Offered me freedom at a tremendous cost
I can't accept the gift without repentance
I talk to God with expectancy
He said "Ask for anything in the name of My Son
If it's My will then it will be done"
I'm not praying for material possessions
Being close to God is the greatest blessing
