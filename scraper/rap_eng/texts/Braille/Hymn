Since the day you saved my soul
You've been proving yourself to me, Lord

[Verse 1: Ambassador]
Let me get deep, Genesis 3
Verse 15, the Gospel first given to Eve
Given to Adam, a woman would be given a seed
Blood will splatter cause this one will be willing to bleed
He put an end to the enemy with his energy
Enter in a world for his enemies, he would intercede
Go up on a tree and appease, he'd be the remedy
Sinners on the outs now hear him shout, "now ven aqu√≠!"
This is Jesus the one whose resurrection's the one proof
He tops heads like buns do
These are dark times, hard to smile like having one tooth
So we drop lines to bring the light in like a sunroof
One truth we need is how our sin is freed
Just believe, don't add nothing like putting in a weave
Just receive, he put in the work
I'm amazed that he saves from the grave plus arrays
What they put in the dirt?
Me

[Verse 2: Shai Linne]
Why we gotta talk about him?
Hmm, wrong question
We ain't gotta talk about him
We get to talk about him
We were made to make much of him
'Tis so sweet to trust in him, a touching hymn
When I'm bleeding, I wanna touch his hem
Before the throne of God above, I was subject to be judged
'Til Jesus paid it all and it was nothing but the blood
Jesus blood was spilled in pain
But he wasn't killed in vain
Cause all who trust in him lose all their guilty stains
Nothing in my hands I bring, simply to the cross I cling
And can it be in Christ alone?
How sweet and awesome when we sing!
Forever we get to tell about Jesus our citadel
Shoulda been in the pit of hell
Instead we're singing it is well

[Verse 3: Da' T.R.U.T.H.]
In a civil war, homie wavin' a white flagtch
All these shares to honest tears that I fight backtch
I got somewhere to leave my baggage like Skycatch
It's a mistake to look at his people and typecast
An avid reader with cabin fever, the saints rise
Face off with the fallen soldiers in plain sightch
I fell back and leaned on a wall when the paint drytch
Then the devil gave me a run for my money like bank heistch
Only love and compassion, licking my open sores
They say that chivalry's dead, but he still opens doors
Sent death hell and the grave, homie they ova fo'
God is faithful, put respect in his name, por favor
I need more time, vanity in my veins
Naturally but it's peace when the sanity's in my brain
He's so good boy and He planning to be the same
Shelter in the storm and a canopy when it rains
I'm gone

[Verse 4: Braille]
And I don't need a platform to rap for him
As if it matters more if more see it
My God is all-seeing, I'm seeing life in a different light
There's nothing new under the sun
But everyone under the Son is made new
I'm no longer on the fence, now my defense is offense
I'm drawn away from sin when I gaze upon him often
Look unto the Lord, is you for Him or against Him?
The gospel is offensive cause it deals with our offenses
But God is more offended when it comes to the unrepentant
And the darkness in the hearts of those refusing to surrender
I'm a messenger of grace, Christ crucified the message
And when I count my blessings
He's the treasure that's most precious, yeah

[Verse 5: Jackie Hill-Perry]
You can't afford the price for life like you Little Rich with the keys
Between 'em black bars laying flat, that's a major key
He's the best, you can bet ain't no change in him
Penny pinching freedom, it ain't Lincoln that slaves needed
The grave beat it
And moonwalk when he raise even the stars know his fame
Stays daily it's rain season, his name's Jesus
We ain't passive-aggressive or vain neither
Let us adore him in Romans don't pay Caesar
He waved either to tell you hello or to save seeds
From the same evil that Bell Biv Devoe when they sang "Poison"
The fangs leave from the neck
When the veins bleed from the stretch
And the same fellow that made Adam even with one breath
It's easy
