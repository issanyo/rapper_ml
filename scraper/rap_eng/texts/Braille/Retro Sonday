[Verse 1: Eshon Burgundy]
Yo I'm screaming out, “Hurry Lord, hurry Lord”
What was once beautiful is pure ugly Lord
You know?
I'm sayin before I'm buried Lord
I'm hopin for ya perfect will to be open and real
Tryna stay broken and provoked to show up in the field
Centerfield
Sinnerville
I feel right at home
Was in the hospital
With a kid that was almost killed for buyin chrome
Wrestle with the Bible cannot leave that Light alone
Lesson in survival lose the life you tryna own
In reference to my rival
I know that he real I'm responsible for mine
But let's not act like he don't steal
Kill and destroy
Men, women, girls and boys
Dream of the day that I can watch him be deployed
God's promise something we cannot avoid
Sayonara to the aura of the occult
And farewell to all unrighteous revolt
A step further than King’s dream
ML King's dream
The Trinity, the universal supreme team
I know I'm foul but I hunger for the thunder
The crackin of the sky before the chariot arrives
There is forgiveness for us
Iscariots,  His vest is blood-dipped
His tongue sharp as an arrow tip
Now these J's I got on
Sicker than asthma
But please, they could of kept these
And brought me back the Master

[Hook: Eshon Burgundy]
King of Heaven
King of Glory
Bring'em back
Calm the sea
And walk the water
Bring'em back
The definition of true love
Bring'em back
He died in cold blood
Bring'em back

[Verse 2: Braille]
I'm screaming out hurry Lord, maranatha
We out here in the final days, the last chapter
How long will it last?
I can't give an answer
But I was sent from the dispatcher to preach to the broken and fractured
Scatterin seed, the God
Who made us is holy
And we
Are guilty before Him because of our wicked deeds
They say I don't need your religion or pleading petitions
To receive a bleeding Savior to save me from my condition
But when Jesus returns
It’ll be a dramatic scene
That's why I play the sermon clip and unload the magazine Glory to the King
There is mercy for sinners
The gates of Heaven are open there's only one way to enter
It might sound dogmatic
But if your faith is static when you stand before God
Than its more than problematic
That's why I'm so emphatic no matter the demographic
It's compassion
Without Christ life will end tragic
Ya’ll I used to be a dead man
Walkin in the darkness
Spiritual carcass, now I'm alive because my God lives
I preach the same gospel that the gospel of John gives
The same gospel that J Given the same gospel that John Givez
Timeless Vintage
The message doesn't change
But on the day when He arrives
That's when everything changes
New heaven and earth
Sin and suffering is over
And the glory of the King
Will be seen full exposure

[Hook]
