[Verse 1]
When I wake up new mercies meet me
Two hearses greet me
They search me with an urgency
We sea deep like seaweed
Body bent like it's cursive
This worship is rehearsal
It's universal who you work through
The churches purpose is to search you, mmm
This verse's purpose is to lurk the murkin' purpose of the joy thief
I seen it hidden
Where the joy be?
Inside the commands the plan B 'Destroy me'
The part of me
That can't enjoy Thee
The ploy be deploy peace
Two fingers like a 70's boy seen with some bell bottoms
Hell always riding with objects
They rejected better yet they forgotten the compass
That the optics only option is spotting the Abba
When adoption's got you, Gotham [?] is cropped from the topic
It's a process when no watching or rockin' his promise
Must be honest there's some blindness this time in my progress
Um then I remember

[Hook]
You make us happy when we look at you
You make us happy when we look for you
Satisfaction only happens to those
Who were glad in you
Glad in you

[Verse 2]
I tried to find joy in everything
Searched a couple mountains
Even thought I could get it from two from fifteens
That filled my lungs with something higher and inspire me like a sixteen or Sistine
It didn't work
But what did it was the finished work
Brought me back to Himself
Now I'm living in reverse
Seeing good gifts as a glimpse of the giver
Not the gifts as a giver
Merry Christmas if the vision works
If you seen him then you get it
An image no sentence can keep out of a mental prison
Our mental was limited with mention of His existence
When it was finished, that was the beginning of all joy, all the attention
If I'm happy in You
I'm happy with You
Attraction to You makes our drastic passions turn to ashes
Grab the urn and burn it faster
Then Jackie Turner satisfaction serving you
I'm just happy learning you

[Hook]
