[Verse 1: Braille]
And I don't wanna go to your funeral, I'd rather die first
But I don't want you to see me die so I don't know which one is worse
It's like the lesser of two evils, I know these days are evil
So I pray the Lord will guard me from the evil one, he's schemin'
I've seen friends turn their back on the Lord
It weighs heavy on my shoulders, yet I know the story isn't over
So I'm hoping for the best and keeping my mind sober
When my phone rings, I hear the voice of somebody that's broken
And I wanna say I told ya, now it's too late to listen
Running in circles with friends who struggle with addiction
Caught in a spider's web, this life is but a vapor
And lust is like a viper waiting in the grass to strike ya
I was called to give my life instead of keep it
Gotta leave behind my sin if I wanna follow Jesus
In our weakness is where the Gospel meets us
The beauty of redemption revealed in our broken pieces

[Hook: Aaron Strumpel]
Shadows cross right over me, right through me
And my thankfulness for this life is busted up certainly
But you go to the bedrock of my inmost being
Sowing seeds of gratefulness you see me

[Verse 2: Braille]
God is my rest, but lately I'm losing sleep
The Good Shepherd never loses track of his sheep
That's a good thought to ponder when I see so many wander
Off road, it makes me wonder how I keep from going under
When I'm overwhelmed, I know I'm in over my head
Fighting with myself but my opponent is dead
How can we win the battle when we burn deeply within?
Jesus laid down His rights, I can lay down my sin
If He is Lord, all that competes with him loses
Only He completes me and cuts through the confusion
Of my wants and my needs, my desires and my dreams
His love inspires me to lift my thoughts to higher things
I was called to give my life instead of keep it
There's nothing worth keeping if it's keeping us from Jesus
In our weakness is where the Gospel meets us
The beauty of redemption revealed in broken pieces

[Hook: Aaron Strumpel]
Shadows cross right over me, right through me
And my thankfulness for this life is busted up certainly
But you go to the bedrock of my inmost being
Sowing seeds of gratefulness you see me
Shadows cross right over me, right through me
And my thankfulness for this life is busted up certainly
But you go to the bedrock of my inmost being
Sowing seeds of gratefulness despite my feelings
