[Sample]

You feel it
You feel it
You feel it
You feel it like braille
You feel it like braille
You feel it like braille
You feel it like braille
And I can feel it
And I can feel it

[Verse 1: Braille]
Deep breath as I cross the street
What's on the other side right across the street
Double crossed
Homie had a cross on his necklace
Thought I could trust him
Cross examination
I take back that last statement
Boiling point
I could feel the lack of
Patience
Planets and habitations
Panic and passive hatred
Go off the top in a battle get decapitated
They don't hurt you on accident it's always premeditated
They had it all planned out
I want to fly away
But I can feel gravity
And the depravity
Of my humanity
I feel trapped in a bubble or a square
Then I complain like 'the struggle ain't fair'
Cities destroyed by tsunamis
Different forms of despair
Like my issues don't compare

[Hook: DJ Revolution Scratches]
You feel it like braille
You feel it like braille
You feel it like braille
And I can feel it
And I can feel it

You feel it like braille
You feel it like braille
You feel it like braille
And I can feel it
And I can feel it

[Verse 2: Braille]
I let the cat out the bag my life was getting hard
It's still raining cats and dogs on the boulevard-
Of broken dreams chasing after light beams
Staying close to my shadow
Keep your enemies close
Raising my daughter in a broken home
And when she's not with me I'm just home alone
Might get a few calls on my mobile phone
But I keep it on silent when I'm in the zone
Ha!
I zone out when the beat come in
Speak life over death that's why I can't sleep cause I'm
Facing problems like man
Can't keep running
Blood sweat and tears you really want to bleed from it
This is my job
I keep my shirt tucked it
But I never punch out
Sometimes I punch in
I feel the weight of this fallen world
I know you feel it too
The lord is my refuge redemption and rescue

[Hook]
