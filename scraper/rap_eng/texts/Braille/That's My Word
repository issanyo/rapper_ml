[Hook] [Braille]:
Authentic with y'all in it, no doubt, no doubt y'all we turn it out
That's my word
"Word"
There you have it
That's my word

[Verse One] [Braille]:
It's the return of the prodigal son back on the saddle
It took awhile to break from the shackles
More miles to travel, still kickin' up gravel
There's still more battles to fight and more topics to tackle
Grab a pot, hold it, it's too hot to handle
Warnin' signs in the sky with a Roman Candle
I've been grindin' all year and I can't stand still
Surrounded by scoundrels, downfalls and scandals
Send me an angel to protect my territory
Cause I'm terrified of what the future might hold for me
Illegal downloads, record labels goin' bankrupt
And I'm still rappin', I haven't lost my passion

[Hook] [Braille]:
Authentic with y'all in it, no doubt, no doubt y'all we turn it out
That's my word
"Word"
There you have it
That's my word
Authentic with y'all in it, no doubt, no doubt y'all we turn it out
That's my word
"Word"
There you have it
That's my word

[Verse Two] [Theory Hazit]:
All these rappers catchin' vapors, karma got they tongue
They not, they out for Washington
They here today and gone today but death is something promising
As you bowing down to platinum jeans and diamond teeth this is
Horribly MCing is construing know who Jesus is
Worshiping these one hit wonders, I mean blunders
Many summers come and go and so do they along with the units and numbers
It's a bummer, hella bogus
They scream "battle" but won't shadowbox with Lois
Superman status, get clowned by Theory Hazit
Pumpin' Master it's a classic, dope on plastic when I craft it
Get it crackin', tongue lashin' like Michael Jordan scorin' on a court a quarter past life
Enter like, "he wack", but exit like "Haz nice"

[Braille]:
Ayo I'm still at it
Tryin' to make a classic like Illmatic
Midnight Marauders
I'm Criminal Minded
It's hard to find a balance
I keep it movin'
Constantly improvin' and mixin' the message with the music
I try to be transparent cause actin' is not my forte
Find me in the northwest and go check my tour dates
Travelin' Man
Mos Def made the theme song
It's just another game of pinball or ping pong
I sing songs to keep the streets calm
Ring the alarm
It's odd, it's all peace in the middle of Vietnam
I don't gotta see it on TV
Cause everywhere I go
Gunshots in the parking lot after my show
This is the actual
All city, international
The darkness surrounds me homie, so I have to glow
The fans show support, after shows they show love
I sho' nuff appreciate the love and show it back
I'm still blooming, when I fail I try again
Turn up the bass and call me Boomer Esiason
Shotgun formation
I'm not done rockin'
This is the optimum, I only got one option
Spiritual minded behind the scenes and on camera
Monkey business and these bangers got 'em screamin' "Bananas!"
I'm not sellin' my soul boy, neither should you
Good music is from the heart so I'm keepin' it true

[Hook] [Braille]:
Authentic with y'all in it, no doubt, no doubt y'all we turn it out
That's my word
"Word"
There you have it
That's my word
Authentic with y'all in it, no doubt, no doubt y'all we turn it out
That's my word
"Word"
There you have it
That's my word
