[Hook: Latifah Alattas]
Praise God from whom all blessings flow
Praise Him all creatures here below
Praise Him above ye heavenly hosts
Praise Father, Son, and Holy Ghost

[Verse 1: Braille]
I will offer a sacrifice of praise, I know it's gonna cost me
The cost is not greater than the cross where you bought me
I was lost and you sought me, I was ignorant, you taught me
I was impotent against my enemies, you fought for me
I exist for your glory, never for mine
I never would shine if it wasn't for your Spirit inside
You made me alive when I was dead in trespasses
The passion of Christ left my sin in the past tense
Every good and perfect gift comes from your hand
You set me back on course when I run from your plan
No excuse to refuse to lift my voice
Because the gospel is true, there's always reason to rejoice
And that don't mean that my sorrow is inconspicuous
But when I grieve, I got a greater joy in the midst of it
The joy of knowing I will see you face to face
And it's all to the praise of your glorious grace

[Hook: Latifah Alattas]
Praise God from whom all blessings flow
Praise Him all creatures here below
Praise Him above ye heavenly hosts
Praise Father, Son, and Holy Ghost

[Verse 2: Odd Thomas]
Oh God full of glory and grace
Open in me a fountain of faithful praise
Let it flow from the depths of my heart like great lakes
Let my soul be the sweetness that spreads its fragrance
Save me from the love of the world that you created
More than the God whose beautiful hands made it
Break me from pride and consecrate me
Make me feel the weight of my sin, sorrow and safety
Let me sing with the saints of your great salvation
And join in the songs of all creation
Let the winds obey, the oceans wave, the mountains cave
Let every star you placed display grace
Let my speech do the same as the skies proclaim
Let everything that has life and breath bless your name
Let the earth be the stage where all creation aims
To heaven in endless praises and adoration

[Hook: Latifah Alattas]
Praise God from whom all blessings flow
Praise Him all creatures here below
Praise Him above ye heavenly hosts
Praise Father, Son, and Holy Ghost
