If I fall and lose it all let my pride be defeated
The cure to my weakness
Every man has a dark secret
It eats away at our heart where we keep it
I can feel victory rising up as I speak this
Confessing my sins, they all get deleted
Decorate my life with humility and uniqueness
I got to let you go now, you're no longer welcome
At times we get selfish and stubborn, Lord help us
Wash away my bitterness, forgive and deliver me
I'm lost in the wilderness, wondering aimlessly
I can't blame the government for the pain I see
So instead of complaing I rather help those in need
Listen to the wise and submit to authority
It's part of my testimony, I can't compromise it
Trying to stay humble and living life like Christ did
Count it all joy when I'm making sacrifices

I'm trying to find, that place of humility
Deep down inside
I don't want to lose what I have
We all want everything
I'm tring to reach, that place of humility
Deep down inside
I'm trying to do the best that I can
And be thankful for what I have

I wrote so much now, I'm running out of words
Trying to emotions into literary terms
As I juggle my responsibilities and opportunities
I'm not a teenager no more, I'm twenty four
I've walked through a lot of doors and face many more
Trying to learn from the mistakes I already made before
I understand that no man is perfect and complete
I also now that God is strong when I am weak
So I stand on my feet, through victory and defeat
How I made it this far is a mystery to me
Every time I write it's like my history repeats
Searching this life for humility and peace

(Chorus)
Yesterday is gone, I miss it so much
I'll never forget you, its hard to move on
Today slips away, he was so young
His time was cut short, rest in peace my man
And now we celebrate the birth of tomorrow
New smiles form and replace all the sorrow
I hold on to the memories you left me
Pass them to the young so they know their history
Making an effort to embrace every moment
It seems the end approaches before we ever notice
I won't take you for granted while your here
I know we're not promised tomorrow again
I got a child on the way, the joy of my world
As I write this I don't know if your a boy or a girl
It seems the future is sneaking up on me
I'm not afraid, I just pray for humility
