[Verse One: Ethic]
Bow to the response date, given time to motivate
But exploded just short of long enough for the spot to evacuate
When I'm through with ya, I'll drag your skin to a taxidermist
You acting nervous entering what you thought was a skirmish
I eat a bottle of Advil to relieve my migraine
It's the curse of a brain to big for a skull to contain
Without shame, I let my rhyme mess with your mind
Taking vital signs, hard to find, but I flat line
Free humankind like a hyper evolved specimen
The pathogen immune to all forms of modern medicine
Maneuvering past asteroids like the Millennium Falcon
Continuous shouting makes it the skills that you're doubting
Ethic will diss ya just for thinking you're a singer
If I were to express my true thoughts they'd be too ill for Jerry Springer
I'd single handedly abolish the first amendment
Cause freedom of my speech will render everybody offended
Like a blended example of Rush Limbaugh and Howard Stern
My writing are like Sutter Cane and in my Mouth Of Madness you burn
Turn of events, my words are like a shot to the gut
You touch my notebook you die, multiple paper cuts
