[Intro]
No one. None. The idea's become obnoxious. I watch the clock as I practice. Time slips though my fingers
Quicker than I thought it would. Okay

[Hook]
No one to talk to except the voices in my head
The voices are the ones telling me to go to bed
No one to talk to except the voices in my head
The voices are the ones telling me to go to bed

[Verse One]
I feel like a hero, I wanna rescue
My journey's illuminated by sentimental value
I'm here for you, who made me like this?
The night gets dark enough to shut down my eyelids
I don't give up, my shirt is your blanket
Sudden movement always keeps a quiet man alert
You're sleeping on my shirt, I hear it
Shades of bass in the distance
My patience begin to melt
I built no room for explanation
The remains of my brain splash against my protection
I'm the man in the mirror, I'm the criminal's reflection
I'm empty, serving justice before you let me
I barely ever get to share my poetry
Class, put down your pencils, it's now 8:30
It's now 2:30, retire from your desk
I said to go to bed, but you're headed towards the deck

[Hook]
No one to talk to except the voices in my head
The voices are the ones telling me to go to bed
You're not smart, but that doesn't mean you're stupid
I'm not smart, I've always been creative
It's not something I decided I was
It happened when I wrote how I was feeling cause
I never say never, and the fact I won't say it
Is the reason that I don't believe it

[Verse Two]
That still doesn't explain all this meaningless time
When there's no one home, and there's no one alive
My mind disappears yet things remain clear
It's part of my nature as I creep down the stairs
There's people under the stairs who don't seem to care
They say go to bed in a tone that makes me scared
Beware, discovery destroys my purpose
Thinking about thinking, wrestling in bar dust
I can't put my finger on it, it's part of human science
My life's an experiment, tears went rolling down my shoulder
Well, I'll understand this battle when I'm older
I'm glad when it's over, release me from this cage
People always tell me that I'm mature for my age
But I haven't wrote one mature line on this page
I'm just a teenage capture in a teenage stage

[Hook]

[Verse Three]
I don't make suggestions, I just answer questions
So if you're not asking, then we're probably not talking
From school to dinner was always isolation
And after dinner time, everyone started sleeping
I've beaten all these ideas into my head
And it seems that by now, I should deserve to go to bed
Physically, with energy, there's plenty of me left
But mentally I've gently been beaten to death
But mentally I've gently been beaten to death

[Hook]

I never say never

Never ever ever
