[Hook: Braille and Citizen Aim]
And I want my dream to be your dream
The dream that you gave to me
And I want my dream to be your dream
The dream that you gave to me

[Verse 1: Braille]
You want hurt?  I got hurt
You want pain?  I got plenty to go around
Come and get it
Run my name through the mud I'll give you the dirt
And pray for the rain like we're stuck in the famine
When I'm suffering it's time to examine
My heart.  Visit the core and survey the damage
My life is not a right that I earned or deserve
To be blessed beyond the boundaries of human concern
I did not create the foundations of the earth
So everything I give was given to me first
I just return it to the rightful owner
Keep fighting till my physical life is over
Your eyes never hold
Excellent and awesome are a reflection of God's grace
And how much it cost Him
To redeem the un-redeemable I dream
The unthinkable and let go of control
'cause I don't want it if He did not give it
Humble when I spit it the weight has been lifted
From my trespasses and my transgressions
So all glory goes to Him humble beginnings

[Hook: Braille and Citizen Aim x3]
And I want my dream to be your dream
The dream that you gave to me
And I want my dream to be your dream
The dream that you gave to me

[Verse 2: Citizen Aim]
I haven't had a vision since I slipped in reality
With a conjured operating instilled in me
When there were holes in the net of the dream catcher masterpiece
The nightmares never made it through the squash piece
No doves, no [?] hand signs
To relay only rely on the ghost machine
From the shell doesn't speak when it tells
But I moved and I felt when it whispered go and follow feet
Hand scripted of line go and choose sides
Skip the picket fence straddle battle whose right
Put my life before you, you put your rights as the truth
Now decipher through ooze or want something more
Blue, black, backin' up the grey skies
Sun raised break through promisin' the same kind
Of warped the love this doesn't fill hearts
First beginnings sure subtle humble from the start
Slowly inch towards the finish line cap
But then the minute rime laps
Come full circle but the time pass
When I started it was pieces of me
Never thought that you could use the broken pieces in me

[Hook: Braille and Citizen Aim x2]
And I want my dream to be your dream
The dream that you gave to me
And I want my dream to be your dream
The dream that you gave to me
