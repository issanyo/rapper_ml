[Hook: Braille]
We gonna have to handle this
Channel this energy
The damage has already been done
It's time to get revenge the right way
Get revenge the right way
We gonna have to handle this
Channel this energy
The damage has already been done
It's time to get revenge the right way
Get revenge the right way

[Verse 1: Braille]
Don't get me wrong when I make this song
I'm just a messenger for inter ventilation from my chimney with this fire
I'm spittin' if I pop em in the mouth
Pop the trunk and throw the body in
Or get my posse involved
Kamikaze and the obvious reaction they expect from me
Just let it be
I keep em guessing and they ain't got telepathy
Cause I turn the other cheek It's not a weakness
It takes a bigger man to put together all the pieces
My choices will affect my daughter nephews and nieces
I don't wanna infect em with any of my diseases
So ceasefire chill we got children in the mix
So I can't go aping wild out like gorillas in the mist
Rebuild until my life gets better than before
Connected to the resurrector let him settle the score on my behalf
So I can bring destruction and wrath
But is it worth getting sidetracked off the right path?

[Hook: Braille]

We gonna have to handle this
Channel this energy
The damage has already been done

Get revenge the right way

[Verse 2: Ruslan]
I feel vibrant how do you survive it
When they start wildin' out and get violent
But I've been on this path my father has taught me that
Characters revealed on the field and how you react
I feel like real life's better than what a pill might do
So I press on even when it don't feel right
Been laughed at stabbed in the back
Spit on talked about didn't know until after the fact
And I ain't trying to get even Stevens
Let them stone them
Saw the heavens open up and felt the Lord
Hold 'em console 'em
I can't condone 'em
They are not understanding me I can't control 'em
So I let go of my insanity

[Verse 3: Beleaf]
You had me out of obligation
I remember walking home from road to station
Cause you kicked me out of our place and
Spitting on my face and carry on your case and
Lying to the lawyers bout the truth so you can save face and
Put that fear in me so I wouldn't be complacent
Used to dream about your death and your funeral arrangements
I'm the first born you made all your mistakes with
Beat me as a child as man I am patient
I heard abuse can be contagious
But I left that in my past like slaves under racists
It's crazy cause even though we still see him
It's easy to forgive when you know you got freedom

[Outro: Beleaf]
It could taste so sweet or it could taste so bitter
Don't hold the pain in get healed and deliver
That's revenge the right way
Get revenge the right way
