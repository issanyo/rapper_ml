[Intro]
Shh, right, quite on the set
Don't give me that look
Hold up hold up
You guys ready?

[Hook]
There's really nothing left to say
You gonna do what you gonna do
Live how you wanna live
There's really nothing left to say
Nothing left to say
There's really nothing left to say
You gonna do what you gonna do
Live how you wanna live
There's really nothing left to say
Nothing left to say

We go "mmm" when it tastes good
Yo when it sounds hot
You wastin' my time so I'm pointin' at the clock
It's all I got to do you know exactly what I mean
Must a been a butter fiend
You in the ring of butter been
You steal things [?] ER, does that ring
A bell is it over your head? Ding a ling
Is it me or do you see it to?
I don't play games, I watch DVDs on my ps2
If you were in my shoes you would be stressed to
You would break down and maybe break through press through
Yes you gotta choose for yourself
I don't do the right thing cause I have to I do it cause I want to
Walls I walk through barriers that block you
I don't care if I'm number one
Don't care if I'm top two
My brain is a mess probably looks like chop sue
[?] ain't nothing about this life is easy
I speak with my hands and use them for grindin'
Write with my eyes closed music for blind men
Fight with my hands tied kicking and screaming
Live through a nightmare but keep on dreaming
I'd rather get the silent treatment
Then have hateful words spark a violent sequence
I'm not talking bout the past
Yo these thoughts are recent
I figured it was time to release them

[Hook]
There's really nothing left to say
You gonna do what you gonna do
Live how you wanna live
There's really nothing left to say
Nothing left to say
There's really nothing left to say
You gonna do what you gonna do
Live how you wanna live
There's really nothing left to say
Nothing left to say

[Verse 2]
I get the last word in
Sign online type my password in
Update my status on the social network
Rock to the beat that's making you neck jerk
Grind hardcore from my nine to fivers
Morning and night pull another all nighter
I get rushed and attacked like a bullfighter
Soul survivor I don't let go I hold tighter
West-sider hear the story from both sides
Before you decide the enemy seeks to divide
Wolf in sheep's clothes its only a disguise
You gotta speak up yo I can't read your mind
I can't waste this life I don't got nine
I'm not feline I feed lines
Into the veins that's a I V rhyme
Same mind frame in a different time
I get surprised when the plans change
It's bananas and plantains
But I can't panic I got ta maintain
They lookin at me
Like I lost my mind or I'm totally insane
They probably right it's my problem though
God is sovereign so I'm standing on a solid rock
Rollin down the block knowing
After the storm comes the rainbow with a pile of gold

[Hook]
There's really nothing left to say
You gonna do what you gonna do
Live how you wanna live
There's really nothing left to say
Nothing left to say
There's really nothing left to say
You gonna do what you gonna do
Live how you wanna live
There's really nothing left to say
Nothing left to say

[Outro]
Nothing left to say (x8)
