[Verse: Foreknown]
With the pride of an eagle
I exaggerate my wingspan, I do not fly, I soar
But I’m no bird of prey, I’m simply here to play and explore
I am the sparrow and it’s buried in the deepest part of my being, my core
I sail over the cities and towns, over the hills and the fields
Taking in the sense of wonderment that it yields
The thing that nobody knows is that I’d give
All of my feathers to be one of the men
To simply be living amongst the ground dwellers
So I sail over the cities, over the shops, and the stores
Watching transactions between consumers and entrepreneurs
Listening to one-sided conversations on cellphones
Wishing I was on the other end, instead of flying alone
But still I’m flying alone, they would never embrace me
Sometimes I just wish one of ‘em would just catch me and cage me
They think that it’s so great to be as free as a bird
But if it doesn't come with love, freedom's the ugliest word
And I've seen love, I know it’s something that they possess
When I follow them from the city to the suburban nest
I see that mommy’s cooking dinner and daddy’s paying the bills
Too busy to ever notice the little bird on the window sill
I tuck my beak into my chest and turn around to fly away
That’s precisely when I heard a little boy’s voice say

[Foreknown & Catalina Bellizzi]
“Little bird, little bird, sitting on the window sill
Everything’s gonna be fine if you just sit completely still.”

[Foreknown]
So still I sat, frozen. I wouldn't risk taking a breath
I’d be content to stare in his eyes, until I starve to death
He noticed me, so this is what it’s like to feel free
He’s looking into my eyes, so this is what it’s like to fly
He smiles at me, so this is what it’s like to feel loved
Unflinchingly, I smiled back, and that’s when everything went black

[Outro: Catalina Bellizzi]
Wish you saw, wish I was, wish you saw what I saw
Wish you saw, wish I was, wish you saw what I saw
Wish you saw, wish I was, wish you saw what I saw
Wish you saw, wish I was, wish you saw what I saw
Wish you saw, wish I was, wish you saw what I saw
Wish you saw, wish I was, wish you saw what I saw
