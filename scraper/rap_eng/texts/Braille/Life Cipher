Ay yo, I cipher in the center of this life cycle
It's a rhyme recital written for your safety and survival
It's vital information for a dying generation
My text respiration for the earths restoration
And edification, soul crusade, I tour the states
Eight years rhyming, still improving with age
Making musical wages, moving crowds in all locations
On stages and radio stations, got love for all creation
Rocking the nation I'm patient, motivated to make it
The David vs. Goliath scenario, blasted through your stereo
From every angle and topic, deposit knowledge
Wisdom and logic cautiously, kicking it constantly
A clear conscience and a strategy for the process
Put thoughts in action with active ingredients, actively feeding this
Vision all that it needs, raising havoc
Even when I wreck it here's a method to my madness
Braille Brizzy I'm back, I connect with the
Track, attack and react with raw rap
Cipher in the center of wherever I'm at
When the beat drops it's on, I let loose and blast
Braille Brizzy I'm back, I connect with the
Track, attack and react with raw rap
Cipher in the center of wherever I'm at
When the beat drops, it's on, I let loose and blast
