[Verse 1: Braille]
I acknowledged my sin to You and I did not cover my iniquity
There's no way to hide from Your all seeing eyes
You know everything I can't tell You a lie
You know my own heart much better than I
You know when I sleep and You know when I rise
You know all the thoughts that go through my mind
From morning to night every moment of pride, Hey!
I acknowledged my sin to You and I did not cover my iniquity
You know what I've done, You know what I do
So I open my mouth and confess it to You
And You're making me new, it's Your Spirit at work
To convict me of sin so I know where to turn
And I know where to run
Run to Your arms to be cleansed of my sin by the blood of Your Son, Hey!
I acknowledge my sin, I know I can't kill it with a knife or a gun
It must be crucified on the cross with Your Son
Then I can know that it's finished and done
Then I can know that I'm truly forgiven and get to the business of living for You
And it's not for my glory but only for You
And it speaks of Your mercy, Your love and Your truth
Give me the faith to believe what You say
And to trust in Your Word when I'm tempted to stray
And to patiently wait for the day You return
I hate my sin it burns but

[Verse 2: Odd Thomas]
Oh God my sin is great, there's no escaping it
I hate my sin but I still partake in it
I've become numb to the touch from feeling it
I've learned the art and skill of concealing it
I might pretend and keep my composure
Hoping never to disclose the truth that it exposes
And even though nobody around me knows it
God, You notice it
And when I'm alone it shows it
I do a good job doing good deeds
Look the right part because I say the right things
Trust in Your Word, and what's best for me
But it seems that I still live in disbelief
I begin to better understand confession
When I understand the weight of my sin and its' effect
And how it's a direct reflection of my selfishness
And recognize Your correct assessment
I don't have to hide behind my own pride
Tear myself up from the guilt inside
Because I've been given everything I've ever needed
To stand clean and forgiven when I received Jesus so

[Chorus: Beautiful Eulogy]
The old will pass away, while I'm still here You hear my prayer
Please, wash my sins away, oh Lord, release me from this snare
