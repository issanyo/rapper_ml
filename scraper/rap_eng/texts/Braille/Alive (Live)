[Hook: Chad Gardner]
What's the difference if we fight fair?
'Cause you live to lie
So are you ready for a nightmare?
I'm right here, alive!

[Verse 1: Beleaf]
I figured it out
I've been just kickin' it, livin' in doubt
Livin' so timidly, uh
I live with fear and it limits me
Can't let the enemy hinder me
Handle these bars
Live in the land of the lost
But I'm disobeying the law
Yeah, I can see through the fog
It's like I be seeing my God
Yeah, it's just me and my dogs
Whole squad ain't scared to handle any beef
Please don't let 'em try to let us off the leash
Ain't nobody really tryna mess with Beleaf
I'll body anybody, anybody wanna see?
Who the illest out there? I don't care
I ain't walking 'round here with the fear no where
Ain't no worry, we ain't goin' nowhere
So you know, no, we don't fight fair

[Verse 2: Braille]
Naw, naw, no, we don't fight fair
When the light's on, the darkness is gone
This is a war that you cannot win
Must keep in mind that you're just a pawn
Not in control, no, not for a minute
Even when I get pushed to my limits
I belong to the King, mind, body and spirit
You're a lie, I'm alive, that's the difference

[Bridge]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Alive, alive
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Alive, alive
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Alive, alive
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Alive, alive

[Verse 3]
Don't you get that I'm defended?
I will never die
It’s a battle that you can’t win
This love, it keeps me alive
And I won’t ever have to die your death
My final breath the birth of life
And I will rise up resurrected
My past and future in Christ
You will never feel my freedom
The embrace of light
Know the power of a new life
Where fear and faith can collide
You’ll never see me in the fiery depths
My soul is kept in paradise
Until I rise up resurrected
I’m right here, right now, alive
And I can hear the beat of heaven
Feel the pulse of life
In my blood and in my future
It keeps my feet in the fight
You’ll never see my in the fiery depths
My soul is kept in paradise
Until I rise up resurrected
I’m right here, right now, alive

[Outro]
'Til I rise up resurrected
I’m right here, right now, alive
'Til I rise up resurrected
I’m right here, right now, alive
I’m right here, right now, alive
I’m right here, right now, alive
