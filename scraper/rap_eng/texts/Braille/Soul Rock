Soul Rock Rock, Rock your Soul
Soul Rock Rock, Rock your Soul, let me hear you say
Soul Rock Rock, Rock your Soul
Soul Rock Rock, Rock your Soul

The Soul Rock soldier, rock solid sonic Solomon
Rock in Sodom and Gomorah, souls tortured, sin abolishes
Society, the beats and rhymes bring the balance back
I swing a battle axe, attack accurate, lyrical tactics
Take flight over the badlands, bad habits reign supreme
Battered and bruised, confused with shattered dreams
It's time to change the scene, full swing, drums harder to hit ya
Get a ticket for the show, your missing the big picture
Dis-figured images, deception dominates the premises
It's war, but who's the enemy? Who's the nemesis?
Pessimistic perceptions spread spiritual pestilence
(soul rock) not just to entertain but also for your soul's benefit
