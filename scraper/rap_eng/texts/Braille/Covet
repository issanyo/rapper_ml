"This song is called Covet. It goes down in three parts."

[Verse 1: Odd Thomas]
I heard early in life you deal with the hand your dealt
But it was unconcerned words from people who never felt
Or never needed
I pleaded so many times to be seated among the wealthy
Only to be greeted with a blank look for looking for help
You can see it in my face
Got me dreaming of leaving this place
To obtain a better life for mine
And aspire to provide for my wife and I
I've never been afraid to use my hands
Or get them dirty
In fact I work just as hard as any other man
If I could get just one wish
My hope would be to get one chance
To strike it rich and switch my circumstance
And advance myself to count myself as one of them
You know them
The ones who never have to pretend to be
Who have money for everything
Who never have any enemies
Who write checks then check out
And never have to worry about anything
I wanna live like that
Because what they got
Is a lot more appealing than what I got
They got no care for me
So I should take a little bit of what they got
Why not?

"As we continue on, scene 2 to the story."

[Verse 2: Braille]
Fast forward past my formative years
And it appears I'm stuck here
Looking back on wasted years
And I got nothing to look forward to
Unclear where to steer
Where to go or
How to get far from here
Far away from the shed where I lay my head
And often shed my tears
Deep down I long for a place to belong
Safe and calm
It seems I always went the wrong way
Now all my dreams are gone
No destination left for me, no destiny to manifest
Trying to catch butterflies
But I got a hole in my net
I want to escape and run away
Because every day I'm forced to fake it
If the opportunity showed it's ugly face then I would take it
And no one would expect it
Guess I never had the heart to tell them I wanted a fresh start, cause I've been barely getting by for a long time
It's easier to leave and never have to see them bleed
And I might sound like a coward
But inside I feel powerless
They say the eyes are the windows to your soul
If so then my windows are broken glass
Shattered pieces that's
Where I hide and keep my secrets at

"And now the story makes a hard turn left. Scene 3"

[Hook: Odd Thomas, Braille, Courtland Urbano] x2
Before the world began and the fall of man
You unfolded the drama of salvation's plan
And though we violate
We're cursed by the law
He sent his son to die
And he absorbed it all
We covet, we kill
Our throats are open graves
We lie and we steal but he still saves
It's happening now
New hearts will burn
All creation yearns for the King's return
