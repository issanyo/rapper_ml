[Verse 1: Odd Thomas]
If in one unfortunate moment
You took everything that I own
Everything you've given from heaven above
And everything that I've ever known
If you stripped away my ministry
My influence, my reputation
My health, my happiness
My friends, my pride, and my expectation
If you caused for me to suffer
Or to suffer for the cause of the cross
If the cost of my allegiance is prison
And all my freedoms are lost
If you take the breath from my lungs
And make an end of my life
If you take the most precious part of me
And take my kids and my wife
It would crush me, it would break me
It would suffocate and cause heartache
I would taste the bitter dark providence
But you would still preserve my faith
What's concealed in the heart of having
Is revealed in the losing of things
And I can't even begin to imagine
The sting that kind of pain brings
I would never blame you for evil
Even if you caused me pain
I came into this world with nothing
And when I die it'll be the same
I will praise your name
In the giving and taking away
If I have you I could lose everything
And still consider it gain

[Hook]
It could mean everything, it could mean nothing
One word makes the difference
It could mean everything, it could mean nothing
One word changes everything
It could mean everything, it could mean nothing
One word makes the difference
It could mean everything, it could mean nothing
One word changes everything

[Verse 2: Braille]
(Everyone who trusts in you will not be put to shame)
If that's not what I believed
Then why is that what I proclaim?
If it don't change how I live
Should I still shout it just the same?
If I shout it as loud as I can
Will blessings shower down
From the heavens and land on my crown
To rinse away all my doubt?
And the grace of God is only sweet
To the ears who hear the sound of it
But that sweetness won't be tasted
By the mouth of a counterfeit faith
Only the thirsty will drink from the fountain of life and count
Everything as a loss for the sake of being found in Christ
Obedience to God's word is the safest foundation
A safe haven for saints waiting for the glorious great day when
Our saviour will return
That's the day of restoration
Those who sleep will be awakened
And we will never cease to thank Him
Singing "worthy is the Lamb to receive glory and honor"
Worthy is the Lamb who reconciled us to our Father
Worthy is the one who gives life without end
But if Christ is not raised then we are still in our sin
If...

[Hook]
It could mean everything, it could mean nothing
One word makes the difference
It could mean everything, it could mean nothing
One word changes everything
It could mean everything, it could mean nothing
One word makes the difference
It could mean everything, it could mean nothing
One word changes everything

[Outro]
It could mean everything, it could mean nothing
One word makes the difference
It could mean everything, it could mean nothing
One word changes everything
It could mean everything, it could mean nothing
One word makes the difference
It could mean everything, it could mean nothing
One word changes everything
