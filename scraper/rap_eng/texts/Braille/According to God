[Intro: Joseph]

[Verse 1: Braille]
I'm a believer
Sometimes I believe the lies of the deceiver
The lies are seeds, when they sprout
They lead to seasons of spiritual amnesia
Deep seeded self doubt
That creeps in my conscious feeds my fear
And keeps me up at night conquered by
Critical thoughts my mind is prone to conjure
When it wanders, watching my failures
Play back, play back, on repeat
I'm trying to change the chain of events
But can't rewind or find the delete
Button to push, I'm on the edge
It's like the world is about to end
I'm in the middle of Armageddon
With no arms, no weapons, no armor for protection
It's the testing of my faith
And I know the answers but instead I'm just guessing
Like I forgot that God was my father
And I was set apart for His own possession
His Word is my armor and my protection
Against the enemy's deception but I still question
How could I receive such an incredible blessing
When I feel like I'm less than
Because I went through a divorce, am I
A second rate Christian? I know that's a lie
So I won't listen, through Christ I'm forgiven
I'm being formed into his image
According to God I was called from darkness
Into his marvelous light
He is near to the broken hearted
And faithful to finish what he started

[Hook: Joseph]
Who do you think you are?
Who do you think you are?
Who do you think you are?
Who do you think you are?
Who do you think you are?
Who do you think you are?
Who do you think you are?
Who do you think you are?

[Verse 2: Odd Thomas]
As a child I struggled to identify
Most of my misplaced anger and rage
Dealing with a whole of emotional consequences
Based on the way I was raised
The feeling for affection and affirmation
Adjusted performance to get attention and gain
Some sort of acceptance but found
I was always rejected and pushed away
Deep scars, feelings of not belonging
Caused tall emotional walls
And any attempt to recover from the loss
Of my confidence was incredibly small
The residual effects of abandonment
Had me observing my character flaws
And viewing them all as insufficiently
Capable of relating or growing with God
I believed these lies to be true for me
My experience was the proof for me
Up to the point where I could sense Christ's
Relentless love and complete pursuit of me
And spoke to me offering me hope and life
Through His word showing me His beauty
Changing my perception and giving me
Perspective of the way that God truly viewed me
A man who was prized and pardoned
And chosen before the world's foundation
His own possession, His royal priesthood
I'm part of His holy nation
I'm his friend, I'm valued completely cared for
Enough for Christ to purchase
According to God I'm an adopted child
With intimate access created with purpose

[Hook]
