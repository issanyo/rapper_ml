Sending this one out
Where ever you are

And it was just me and her in the car
Rode trip to nowhere sleeping under the stars
She was buckled in her seat
But wanted to be held in my arms
I sang her a song and prayed from my heart
It was dark in Sacramento
Pulled over to the side I was tired and it's been a long ride
Nothing else matters after this moment
Everything changes It'll never be the same
My daughter asks questions
Like how can I explain it in a way that makes sense to a little child's brain
It isn't child's play this is serious biz, it really is
Starting over just me and my kid
In one year we lived in eight different houses
Slept together on floors and couches
But God filled me with faith to move mountains
God filled me with faith to move mountains

So I don't really worry about tomorrow
Tomorrow get worried about me
Yeah I know yesterday was crazy
Who knows what tomorrow may bring
But I don't really worry about tomorrow
Tomorrow get worried about me
I'm not worried about you
You should worry 'bout worry 'bout me
Tomorrow
You should worry 'bout me I'll be coming for ya

And tomorrow ain't nothing I never seen
Sorrow ain't something I never felt before
I can't predict the future
All I know is how I spend today
We play a major role but I'm not in control
No sense in stressing all the unknowns
I'm learning about contentment
Things in my life been turning around
Once the jury is out the word of mouth starts spreading
And then I see the direction I'm headed
It's better than if things went the way I expected
As long as the Father's will is done I won't be disappointed with the final outcome
There's way to many tomorrow's
And I'm not afraid of losing it all
Whatever I'm going through I know your there and in the end know you're my reward

So never worry about tomorrow
Because tomorrow will worry about itself
Each day has enough trouble of it's own
