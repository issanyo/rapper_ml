[Hook]
Think you wanna walk in another man's shoes
Think you wanna do what he do
Think you wanna be where he's at
Think you wanna be where he's at, huh?

[Verse 1]
I ain't gonna tell you nothin' new
And to the best of my ability every word is true
Tell you my story but I'm not the only one
As you sit back lookin' at the things that I've done
How y'all already promised that I wasn't gonna lie
So while I rap these words you can look me in the eyes
I'm not a perfect man
Let's get that out the way
But that's not a good reason to stray
It's not an excuse when I lose my way
These are choices I live with on each new day
When I say I'm a blessed man
I'm being sincere
But don't assume it was easy for me to get here

[Hook]
Think you wanna walk in another man's shoes
Think you wanna do what he do
Think you wanna be where he's at
Think you wanna be where he's at, huh?

[Verse 2]
It's never enough
Never satisfied unquenchable thirst
When the supply is plentiful
The workers are few and the sky is heavenful
Full of heaven, full of God's majesty shining forever more
The more we hold back the more the tension grows
The more we keep our eyes on the temporal
Permanent residence of the soul is the place of reverence
And grace is the evidence that we will face his excellence
With faith that's measureless
Paved by the footsteps of Christ as he walked to his death
Before we resurrected I strive to be intrepid
Lay me fear at his feet till the day I'm perfected

[Hook]
Think you wanna walk in another man's shoes
Think you wanna do what he do
Think you wanna be where he's at
Think you wanna be where he's at, huh?

[Verse 3]
But he said to me "my grace is sufficient for you. My power is made perfect in your weakness"
Therefore, I will boast all the more gladly about my weaknesses
So that Christ's power may rest on me
That is why for Christ's sake I delight in weaknesses
In Insult in hardships in persecutions in difficulties
For when I am weak then I am strong
