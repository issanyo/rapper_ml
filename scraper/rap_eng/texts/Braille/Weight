[Odd Thomas]
We will not lose heart
Even though this present age will waste away
We will surely suffer, but it's a slight momentary trouble
The deconstruction is painful, but the transformation is beautiful
When we the children of God are crushed under the heavy affliction of this world, be reminded that it's weightless in comparison to the eternal measure of God's glory
We have lost our eyes for the unseen and have swallowed the false hope of the visible
We must realize the empty grave and revel in the certainty of His resurrection with assurance of renewal, considering it worthy to suffer for the faith
So we will worship while we wait
