Constantly growing
We constantly grow
The people we know
Mind body and soul
Good and evil grow
We reap what we sow

Grow or die
The dichotomy a cacophony of mediocrity
Monotony gets pawned off ??
Frontin on your fans
Common yo honestly
Why you even bother B?
You better off being who you oughta be
So part of me
As I outgrow this pottery
Roots run deep
Down where the water be
This honesty brings out the God in me
I'm placed in his garden
Right where I gotta be
The rain gives me food
It's sun gives me light
But, the only reason I grow the Son gave me life

The tent that we live in is for rent, not owned
It withers away then one day it's gone
But inside we thrive, we advance, we sprout
We constantly grow, our souls abound

What up my people?
We break it down to the soil
It all started with a seed, and that includes me
Every thought, every action
Every tree bearing fruit, everything that we see
Growing simultaneously with spontaneity
Celebrated moments and forgotten memories leaving a legacy
Negative and positive, good and evil, wrong and right
Perfect vision and lost eyesight
We see it in hindsight after we fall behind
Learning from mistakes as our heart gets refined
The design of mankind
Clay in the Creator's hand, connected to the vine
Understand who made the man before the man made mandates
The man-maker had a plan greater to save us from the sin nature
Grim reaper, we dig deeper than physical features
Individual students and teachers
The garden of our hearts, reaping a harvest from what was planted
Sowing seeds and taking chances
No time for standing still, life moves on
The cycle continues, the greatest change of your life will happen within you

In a greenhouse
Getting grown organically
Sun precipitation soil no genetic tampering hampering my growth
It's a metaphor for the ceaseless process we all me before our death
Life happens whether or not there were made plans
Memories hold hands with experiences on the sands that time buried
So carry on to the next phase
We the past like the last ?? on next days dawn
It brings along a host of situations
To aid in vegetation it's destiny chasing
Quicken the pace so I can catch the trip
I'm at the winds of change
It's all natural mechanics (it's plain why it feels strange?)
