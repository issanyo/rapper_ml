[Verse 1: Odd Thomas]
There used to be a time when we were fine
Living life with no particular religious bend
Pretending to be our own gods
Inventing our own systems of belief so as to not depend
On anything other than our own self-governing consent
Defending an impending doom with no perceived need
To concede or repent, presuming our innocence in a sense to sin;
The sting of death was only the inevitable end
Of everything we could never rightly understand or comprehend
We used to fear the unknown 'til God made himself known
And atoned, mending the relationship between God and men
Giving His life as a ransom for many when He died and ascended
And in that one event the certainty of eternal death was circumvented
Making a way for the day when history stops and time suspends
Spending eternity in fellowship that never ends
We see the greatest expression of God's love extended in that moment
When those who were once enemies instead became God's friends

[Hook: Odd Thomas, Braille, Courtland Urbano]
And when it's my time to go
Go ahead and take me home
I know I'll be with you
I know I'll be with you;
When it is my time to go
Go ahead and take me home
Nowhere that I'd rather go
I wanna be with you

[Verse 2: Braille]
How sweet the Gospel sounds to ears like mine
Well acquainted with pain and strained relationships
Friendships that suffer from long distances
Or even worse they get severed from something more severe
And He still hasn't wiped away all my tears yet
My cheeks get wet every now and then
Even when I give my best, I know I fall short
I get scared when the ball's in my court
Focused on my performance, wretched and poor
It makes the message more real when I preach it
I'm not there yet so I'm reaching, reaching for a goal:
To stand before my King and be speechless
Then, never again will I question if His grace is sufficient to cover my sin
Cause death is gone, and all the effects of evil and wrong
Will be conquered when His Kingdom comes
So this is my hope and my prayer
The air that I'll breathe in eternity with lungs that never fail me
If it pleases my Lord, and only by Your grace
Use my life 'til it's poured out for Your sake
Until then I'll remain where You have me
With joy when I feel unhappy
And a peace that surpasses all my understanding
My life is in the hands of Your love everlasting

[Hook x2]
And when it's my time to go
Go ahead and take me home
I know I'll be with you
I know I'll be with you;
When it is my time to go
Go ahead and take me home
Nowhere that I'd rather go
I wanna be with you
