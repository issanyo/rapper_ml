[Bridge: Propaganda]
The pain that guides us
The strings that tie us
The coincidence that proves to us God's existence
Joy we misplaced
Beautiful mistakes
The scarlet thread
The Crimson Cord

[Hook: Propaganda]
Wear your scars out loud
That's the fingerprints of The Lord
A crimson cord, baby, a crimson cord
A timeline, a scarlet thread
A crimson cord, baby, a crimson cord
Let me celebrate your crimson cord
And that's beautiful, a crimson cord
No regrets, boy, a crimson cord
Evidence of God's love, that's a crimson cord

[Verse 1: Propaganda]
What it do to a boy's brain to see his father through glass walls
While Algebra homework  less important than last calls
Collect calls come from up state
You eventually grow numb, it's a sad state
And it's hard to conceive, let alone believe that you're worth it
When your little brother's blood is still stained on your Converse
And system leave him hanging, they still binge on syringes
Filled with self-hate, that's why we fly off the hinges
Self-medicate, still struggle at the smell of that fresh kush
Even after salvation, it's tough
Looking back at wasted life, who never had a chance to begin with
Ya'll talking about a lamb that's sinless

[Verse 2: Propaganda]
What it do to a girl's brain to see her father through face time
Why, if you call her pretty, you can have her at lunch time
American dream has filled her Mama with botox
And personalized license plates, dinner dates, he went to Jared's
Can't conceive or believe that you're worth it
When rather than hanging with you, they buy you designer purses
And you ain't pose' to be mad, your dad buys you everything, right?
We should all wish to have your life
While she self-medicates with packages and purchases
Oxycontin morning after pills no condoms
Suburbia good school, healthy church folk parents
Hittin' death, cover-up
Mac product, not enough
