Yea

The size of sin is as small as a grain of sand, but separates between Wide Ocean and dry land
It’s bigger than bad habits; it’s a matter of man seeking for God's spot following in same pattern as Adam
Its deep rooted we are the seed of a broken family tree branching out limbs of disease. Look at this mess we leave
This weight of wickedness is heavy as lead trying to catch its descents like stopping a falling rock in a spider’s web
It’s thin silk thread begins to snap and all that’s left is the residue that sticks between the cracks
It all ends with a slip into a bottomless pit, grips the heart in the man’s chest till swallowing death
Sipping for the glass of God’s wrath and genuine justice a just judge must summons for infinite punishment
The smallest white lie is enough for being indictable
The size of sin so big it causes a cosmic fraction and Hell is the only relevant response to righteous reaction
This is what our sinful actions actually earned us, but God took upon himself the weight of sin reserved for us; a weight so significant that only the blood of an innocent one is acceptable and worthy
So rather than make light of it or minimize the size of it, we should marvel at the magnitude of mercy
