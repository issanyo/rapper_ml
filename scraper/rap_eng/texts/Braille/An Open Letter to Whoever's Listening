[Hook: All]
Greetings, from us to you, pull up a chair
There's a few things we'd like to share
An honest open letter
We address it to whoever, wherever, whenever
You get a chance to listen to what we've put together
And just to be clear, what's in your ears
It's a result of blood, sweat, and tears
Now that we're here, you can hear what we got to say
And the way we say it
The best way to explain it was to make this and just play it

[Verse 1: Odd Thomas]
Ah, this is a little bit love letter and a little bit of incentive
Signed, sealed, and delivered from it sender
With a P.S. of encouragement depending on whether you receive it in
The medium for which it's intended
Dear whoever has ears to hear listen and pay attention
We write to make mention of the Gospel and the Resurrection
Exist with the tension of trying to creatively display Creation, Fall, and Redemption
Contextualize and set the context for the text that's divinely inspired
Maybe music isn't the best medium for making much of the Messiah
But for Courtland Urbano, Braille, and I, there's really is not a lot of options
Only poor penmanship trying to paint pictures of proper doctrine
Make you logically stop and think doxologically
Cause honestly, a little bit of music and theology never really hurt anybody
And it's probably better for your soul
If you ingest the various words letters and tones
As we speak psalms, and write these songs, and sing praises to God
And Him alone, who sits on throne who has shown great grace
And much mercy to His own

[Verse 2: Braille]
And we don't write to get a reaction as highly regarded rappers
That was never the purpose when we permeate these pages with permanent statements
Our determination is a response to our God who loved us first
Immersed in the Word of Life so we write from the heart
And give it all that we got
The Lord ordained that we would make this before the Earth's foundation was laid
So we lay it down for your benefit
Anonymous audience get your audio fix
Medicine for the sick, I used to be an optimist
Now the Gospel is the central message I'm rocking with
Embedded in every line that we spit
Music is a platform, a tool we use to gain influence
But we're more concerned with discipleship than ciphering
Engage the culture with the truth from the Scriptures
When it hits ya the Holy Spirit bears witness
And the proper exposition can switch up your disposition
For the downtrodden and bound up, losing balance, feeling calloused
We empathize with your challenges and pray this might be a catalyst
For spiritual development, so you can worship God more truthfully
Servants of the Messiah
Yours truly
Beautiful Eulogy
