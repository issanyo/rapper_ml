[Verse One: Braille]
I'm guided down a path which the life define
Plant my flag in this world of a spiritual state of mind
My rhymes shines light reflected from the divine
Kick a verse for the masses, change the face of mankind
I'm blind in the flesh, some are blind to the truth
Ignore something too long then it forgets about you
[?] and that excuse
We're equal but the triangle of life is still obtuse
Distribution of tattoos, don't try and remove
The storm is coming, Life was hitting store shelves like can foods
(It's Braille's debut)
Give me your attention
I mention my vision for the sake of worldwide inspiration
Hijack habitats with text respiration
Many sleeping on God, it's time to end hibernation
This isn't competition
My purpose won't be defeated
I'm here to get you open
Or at least open minded
The key to getting ahead has always been getting started

[Storm The Unpredictable]
You better hurry before you start hearing "dearly departed"

[Braille]
I keep my stand corrected

[Storm The Unpredictable]
Unpredictable

[Braille]
Unexpected

[Storm The Unpredictable]
But constant with God in my heart because He's top selected

[Braille]
My smile can't be adjusted by people who can't be trusted

[Storm The Unpredictable]
Cause if I let it my whole spirit will come busted

[Braille]
I'm guided through life course, through God's force I'm protected

[Storm The Unpredictable]
Respect it cause it's keeping me cool calm and collected

[Braille]
Not interested in the amounts you count when you're paid

[Storm The Unpredictable]
Cause the money will go but your soul will never fade

[Braille]
I could care less how fresh you are in a claim

[Storm The Unpredictable]
You're lame, chill with that or be destroyed by your fame

[Braille]
It's all the same, the only change is who's behind it

[Storm The Unpredictable]
Rise, open your eyes stop walking this Earth blinded

[Braille]
Back in the day, hip hop was my only work

[Storm The Unpredictable]
But now I'm a child of God I've put life first

[Hook]
[B] When I inflict pain
[S] It's cause the truth hurts
[B] I do a lot of things
[S] But keep life first
[B] There's more than hip hop to express in a verse
I write what I live, and live life first
[B] When I inflict pain
[S] It's cause the truth hurts
[B] I do a lot of things
[S] But keep life first
[B] There's more than hip hop to express in a verse
I pay rent with happiness, live life first

[Verse Two: Storm The Unpredictable]
Now look here
Somebody told me it was all about flows, bank rolls and hoes
I beg to differ
Coming from the non coke sniffer
The non weed smoker
The non alcohol [?]
The brother who was looking forward to meeting his maker
Storm the Unpredictable
Flows are hot
Hip hop means a lot to me but it is not all that I got
I heard Common say that
That brother made Sense
Negativity stay back, I'll turn down on it before I
Sold out my soul to the evils of this nation
I would repeat that statement with no trace of hesitation
Don't get me wrong, sometimes I fall into temptation
Done things that had my family worried and pacing
But God's got my back now I don't worry who I'm facing
The higher power
Turns things sweet when sour
I'm serious about this, life comes first
Before I step on stage and verbally disperse
That's why to make money I will not curse
Cause what's worse
The cheddar doesn't matter in a hearse
What does matter is the way you've lived your days
The way you've affected lives in your path I pray
That you will, put good use to these words I say
Cause rhyme is not just abuse with your verb display
Serves I made remind you of cause I drop bombs
When it was sent by the creator so no need for alarm

[Hook]

[Verse Three: Braille]
The things I'm called to speak put all my dreams in reach

[Storm The Unpredictable]
By example I teach
My ways and actions preach

[Braille]
I think it's time to expand upon my past attempts

[Storm The Unpredictable]
Before you think we're all a bunch of players, prostitutes and pimps

[Braille]
Putting a price on head checks
It's my mind well spent

[Storm The Unpredictable]
Some of you between the ears don't have one red cent

[Braille]
I've meant what I said while others keep cutting corners

[Storm The Unpredictable]
That's the reason that families have turned into mourners

[Braille]
We don't show your true colors like ink and black and white pictures

[Storm The Unpredictable]
The words we bring register 10 on the Richter

[Braille]
It's about having confidence in the message you deliver

[Storm The Unpredictable]
And constantly being called "the unselfish giver"

[Braille]
Reality hit you harder than a championship boxer

[Storm The Unpredictable]
Don't let the ills of this world outfox ya

[Braille]
In the days when [?] exchange pages for pacemakers

[Storm The Unpredictable]
And they learn that we're afraid so who's waiting to undertake ya?

[Braille]
I look at the future and wonder where time went
I'm upset that so much going down is incorrect
There's different sides of the fence to make it all make sense
My contents intense, it's knowledge you need to get
I'm not out to prove who's more intelligent
I just ask you look at music as more than entertainment
To me it's evident those that talk about guns
Will eventually end up being shot by one
Don't argue till I'm done, these are my concepts
My tongue ain't involved in that traditional nonsense
I'm drug free
You can't control me with a substance
I'm hooked on God, life, the mic and my subconscious
It's obvious, my image won't sell magazines
But if it does than maybe this song changed some things
See I live life before I grab the mic
So on the mic I display life

[Hook]
