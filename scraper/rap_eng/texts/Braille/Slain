[Verse 1: Odd Thomas]
If you don't seek justice, you probably don't know peace
At least the kind of peace that Jesus brings us on account of belief
I don't know if you've noticed but there's a direct corellation
Between your profession of faith and your expressions of grace to the hopeless
Yeah, it's true that all men are broken, but to only help the healthy
Would make us miss the open wounds that matter the most in those moments
The deconstruction of dignity buried deep in the heart of assumptions
Where selective justice is just another name for social corruption
A system is flawed when just cause is "just because"
But even a man at odds with the law is made in the image of God
It's admitted that none of us are innocent all of us complicit
But to solicit the silence of injustice doesn't just dismiss it
And just in case you forgot, Christ will come at just the right time
A divine King bringing perfect justice to judge all of mankind
The only difference between us I'll stay seated at Jesus' feet
And rest between the span of His hands where justice and mercy meet

[Hook: Braille]
There's a virus in my iris
I was blinded, close my eyelids
See my Savior laying down his righteous life
And saying "I forgive" (x3)
Virus in my iris (x3)
Deep down I know my eyes are sick

[Verse 2: Braille]
The wrath of God is coming, can you hear the warning?
Joy comes in the morning, but now is a time of mourning
When all I'm seeing lately is a nation going crazy
Looking bad, needs some hope like the words maybe
If or probably, but if I'm honest in light of all these problems
If my hope is only probable, how long 'til it dissolves?
I don't have the capacity to see these problems solved
I take comfort knowing that my God is still involved
That's my certainty when the road I'm on is serpentine
And I'm threatened by the serpent's sting, the evil one is prowling
Looking to devour, but no one can usurp the King
Lord, have mercy while we're waiting for the final hour
This is my Father's world, it's also a fallen one
The domino effect has infected the whole set-up
I'm not afraid to talk about social injustices
Let's also talk about the throne where perfect justice is
It sounds insensitive and some will hate the stench of it
But the church is not faithful if we fail to mention it
We worship a God who can speak to the world's pain
Because salvation for us came through the Lamb who was slain

[Hook: Braille]
There's a virus in my iris
I was blinded, close my eyelids
See my Savior laying down his righteous life
And saying "I forgive" (x3)
Virus in my iris (x3)
Deep down I know my eyes are sick
