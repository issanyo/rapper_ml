[Intro]
When the storm clouds rise
And the sky is dark
And I'm pressed with anxious care
I've a safe retreat in the strong, high tower
For no ill can harm me there

[Hook]
I'll hide in Your safe retreat
Hide in Your safe retreat
When the storm clouds fly
'Til they pass me by
I will hide in Your safe retreat

[Verse 1]
When the lightnings flash
And the thunders roar
And the storms in fury be
When they seem so sure to engulf my soul
Then I'll hide in Your safe retreat
Soon the storms will pass
And the sky will clear
And my rest be calm and sweet
I will trust and wait with no anxious fear
For I'll hide in Your safe retreat

[Hook]
I'll hide in Your safe retreat
Hide in Your safe retreat
When the storm clouds fly
'Til they pass me by
I will hide in Your safe retreat

[Verse 2: Braille]
Where have I been when it seems like
I'm hiding under a rock? I'm hiding under my rock
I'll seek then not hide, I'm too weak to speak
In the stillness of prayer there's no secrets
God already knows my longing, my yearning
My groaning, my burning, my scars and my hurting
It's no surprise to Him, His watchful eye'll see it
I'm only fooling myself when I conceal it
Apart from grace I would never seek Your sovereign face
Next to You the only place to keep my heart chaste
Otherwise I chase idols to my disgrace
And waste time tryna fix what I can only break
It's when I'm broken that I'm standing open-handed
Reaching out to my Father, knowing You understand me
In Your arms I can safely rest
You're the God who gives life from death

[Bridge]
None of this is wasted
Still becoming who we are
Ordinary people
Extraordinary scars
From a million places
Like a million shooting stars
We belong to hope now
Heaven isn't all that far

[Hook]
Hide in Your safe retreat
Hide in Your safe retreat
When the storm clouds fly
'Til they pass me by
I will hide in Your safe retreat
I'll hide in Your safe retreat
Hide in Your safe retreat
When the storm clouds fly
'Til they pass me by
I'll hide in Your safe retreat

[Outro]
Hide in Your safe retreat
Hide in Your safe retreat
When the storm clouds fly
'Til they pass me by
I'll hide in Your safe retreat
