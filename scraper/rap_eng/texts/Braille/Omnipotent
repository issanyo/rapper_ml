[Verse 1: Braille]
The weakest man I know is the man I see in the mirror
But it's okay to be inferior when you know Christ is superior
Much stronger than my fears and doubts, He's the Overcomer
He holds me up when I'm overwhelmed by the weight my soul is under
From the highest throne is flashes of lightning and rolls of thunder
Yet He knows the number of hairs upon my head, I'm full of wonder
That the One with universal power would be personal
With His creation as He unfolds His gracious purposes so perfectly
I was purchased by the death of Jesus, crucified in weakness
I worship a God who weeped, who intercedes for me while I sleep
Yes I know He hears my cries
He doesn't roll his eyes but rather He sympathizes
And reminds me that all my needs have been provided
I have no reason to trust that I could be strong enough on my own
So I gladly boast in my weakness
That Christ's power might be shown
Manifested through my life to prove my faith is genuine when tested
Cause in the depths of my weakness is when my strength gets perfected

[Hook: Chad Gardner]
Almighty God, omnipotent
You're my confidence
You're my confidence
I am so convinced
You hold me in my helplessness
You're my confidence
You're my confidence
I am so convinced

[Verse 2: Odd Thomas]
Yeah I understand what means to be branded as a Biblical man
But I can't stand the fact that I still try to live up to man's standards
It's really hard for me to be perceived as needy
When everyone around me seems to be succeeding
While making life look so easy
I'm constantly fighting this feeling of failing as a father
And this feeling of falling short as a husband
This sort of never measuring up
Of course it's all in my mind, it's just an expression my pride
Yeah I get it, but it's still hard for me to admit it sometimes
I get so tired of taking refuge in my own strength
While standing with the weight of my insecurities on my back until my bones break
It won't make a difference to my situation as a whole
Whether I tend to hold it together for the moment
Or pretend to be in control
God mold me into a man who holds fast to your everlasting hands
Give me the strength that I need to get past my circumstances
God rescue me, make my desperate attempts cause me to confess
My dependance
And may the depths of my weakness make strength perfected

[Hook: Chad Gardner]
Almighty God, omnipotent
You're my confidence
You're my confidence
I am so convinced
You hold me in my helplessness
You're my confidence
You're my confidence
I am so convinced

[Outro]
Almighty God
Almighty, almighty
Almighty God
Almighty, almighty, God
