These day they put rhymes on everything
Rhymes on TV commercials
Rhymes on comedy sketches
It’s like a rhyme don’t mean nothing no more

I put rhymes on everything
Rhyme pages everywhere
Nothing’s off limits
I rhyme about everything
They say one dimensional
Pay more attention though
Every line is intentional and what I wrote
It’s not a gimmick to get more records sold
If that was the case I woulda quit a long time ago
I’m still here
Shining glow whenever the father let’s me
Cut my hair off, cause I was looking kinda sketchy
I could rhyme about fashion the clothes in my closet
Or rhyme about the cash in my wallet
I could write a song about the gas prices
Or conspiracy theories on that healthcare crisis
Politics build the food pyramids and choose profits over people
We don’t die because we starve
We die because we eat
They say it’s self inflicted
So the ones getting burned are the ones taking the heat


We get rhymes on everything
Most the time it don’t mean anything
So, I don’t hold back anything anymore
Always give my everything
We get rhymes on everything
Most the time it don’t mean anything
So, I don’t hold back anything anymore
I put rhymes on everything


Sharpie and a notebook I’m leaving my mark
Had to lock the flow making words rhyme is the easy part
Speak my peace and let my peace speak like graffiti art
And give you a peace of my heart
When I rip the beat apart like Hulk Hogan’s tank top
Or Hallow da Don so ya’ll can follow along
I worked with S1 before the power song
Now it’s on, my mic sounds nice
Blame it on the Avalon
Extra effort to make it my best record
You can hear my pain and flesh
In every bar and measure
I’m far from a super star
Not a household name
But, I’m known for writing rhymes so I fan the flame
Family man many plans came but I’m still alive
After the famine came
And I still got passion
Not for the spotlight
But, if the beats hot I’ll write a rhyme right on the spot


I’m not new to this
Check my track record I worked with 9th Wonder
Before you heard him on that black record
Haven’t made a classic yet
Haven’t made a whack record
If I start slaking as a father that’s my last record
And now I’m rocking with that optimist
I know God is in control no matter how dark it gets
Some of this songs on the radio are venomous
They are not my nemesis they see my own blemishes and imperfections
My heart was reprobate, redemption resonates
Jesus saves he came to set my record straight
Now my penmanship is for the benefit of everybody
Nodding their heads to this
So, turn the beat up
Until the speakers blow out
Thorns in my side that the tweezers can't pull out
I be writing rhymes till the day that I role out
Until the day that I role out
