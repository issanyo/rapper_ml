[Intro]
Welcome to Weapon Aid. Today's special is
Broken into many parts. It's served with a side of disappointment and garnished with anxiety. Although it seems like a heavy meal dessert will be much lighter. Please excuse my messy outward appearance but I assure you that this waitress is beautiful on the inside
By the way, get well soon. Right?
You're sick. Get well soon, man
Hope that thing clears up cause that is nasty
You been walking around carrying that?

[Verse 1]
Grab your bubble goose fleece, I'm cold blooded beast
When I utter my speech so better beats for the most gutter streets
To the most luxurious I flow fast and furious The four cast is frigid
Freestyle a written
I'm a riot when I rip it [?]
Rippin' on the rhythm
I don't rhyme about the frivolous forget about it
Authentic sugar plums plummet
Passion in my voice because it comes from the stomach
So what you feed on is the type of tick you beat on
Fake fought a phenom, wake up dream on
I stay and hide a man
You know China Japan
Cause I light up the jam
No magic tricks or slight of the hand
Braille briz gonna sail to Brazil
Move to Brazil
Get well soon, the kid's ill
I'm taking off, write me a card
When I return I'm coming back on a lightening rod

[Hook]
We gotta get well soon
Cause we're all so sick
We gotta get well soon
Cause we're all so sick
Get well soon
Get well soon
Get well soon
Get well soon

[Verse 2]
I'm under the weather
Whether the storm trying to get better
Waitin' till the weather is warm but will it ever
Change if I don't
Change if all I do is complain
Then it stays the same
And I can't stay here, lets make that clear
I don't want next year to be like last year
I don't want to feel like I'm always trapped here
It's bigger than my record sales and rap career
Rap with me
What if I snap like bear traps
You feel that like gorilla slaps on bare backs
Embarrass my enemies, expose the pharisees
Give 'em a taste of their own disease
And they don't like that, when animals attack
Who gave the prisoners cannon balls and gat's
Who's the real ones and who's the rats?
It's hard to tell cause the sickness is so easy to catch

[Hook]
We gotta get well soon
Cause we're all so sick
We gotta get well soon
Cause we're all so sick
Get well soon
Get well soon
Get well soon
Get well soon

[Verse 3]
I hope it's not contagious
Somebody call me a doctor
I hope it's not contagious
If it is then you caught it
I hope it's not contagious
Somebody call me a doctor
I hope it's not contagious
If it is then you caught it
Lord please won't you heal me
Open my eyes reveal the real me
Help me see, help me be healthy and free
Help me see, help me be healthy and free
Lord please won't you heal me
Open my eyes reveal the real me
Help me see, help me be healthy and free
Help me see, help me be healthy and free

[Hook]
We gotta get well soon
Cause we're all so sick
We gotta get well soon
Cause we're all so sick
Get well soon
Get well soon
Get well soon
Get well soon
