R-A-W

Raw

Vicious on the rhythm leave the beat in a bad position
It's gonna need more than stitches when I'm finished with it
And that's a clever way to say what my intention is
Kill a track with a vengeance and I won't hide the evidence
There's no question left
I won't second guess the the infinite, the heavens open up for men to enter in
His sanctuary in the sky where we worship him
I gained access, it ain't come to pass yet
We still live in the middle ground
They call my style under
I slap mics with my upper hand
Broken man God's redemption plan gives me hope
And that might be the rawest rhyme I ever wrote
So raw the blood is still red, ecoli
Fee figh of fum a giant on the drum
I am [?] when the fire comes light it up brighter
And keep it raw until I hear well done

R-a-w
Raw
Braille serving God
Until my death
My goal is to stay raw

Move back I'm a boom-bapitarian
So boost the frequency to beats sounds like a feast (beast)
Blood in the water for a shark in the aquarium
When it comes to the bars I'm a barbarian
I ain't no joke homie that's hilarious
Spill my guts on the cut, Caesarean style
This is bringing out the animal in me
React to the track with the animal instinct
My body it broke it's hard words till my body hurts
Working to the point of exhaustion
Working when my stomach is nauseous
Still got a lot to accomplish
So I keep on rocking regardless
My lack of faith is like a slap in my masters face
And pleasing God is worth more than anything I chase
Gotta persevere through the drama and the nonsense
The love of Christ keeps me going through the process

Well done is the new raw
Let me break it down for ya'll no confusion involved
No illusions or mirages
The movement is large
I'm on the grind all day cause I'm down for the cause
Emcees out there you better stand clear
The beats that I'm rocking this year are unfair
Excellence is what I strive for
The Kingdom is what I grind for
And you don't stop
Ohmega Watts on the beat ya'll
Well done is the new raw
Well done is the new raw
