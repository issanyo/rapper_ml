Letting go, of something that you hold close
Why you let it stay around, you just don't know, say
Let it Go
Let it Go
Letting go, of something that you hold close
Tried to make it work out, but it won't, say
Let it Go
Let it Go

I gotta let this go, once and for all, I'm one voice
Speaking in-between the pauses, waiting for my time
Is it right now or has it passed me by, I magnify
The situation through my glass eye and analyze it
What's real and what's fake? It's blown out of proportion
All the voices in my head sound distorted (do the right thing)
And muffled, I'm stretching my faith muscle, this rap game's a hustle
A struggle to stay humble and trust
Big trouble, in little me, causing complications
I run from confrontation, observations made from a distance
My defense to resist, I'm not convinced
That all my silhouettes can co-exist, so I drift
Into the clouds of God's grace and freedom, feeling like these feelings
Is filling me, with pride and negativity I don't need
And even though at times I felt stepped on
And taken for granted, it's time to heal from the damage

Letting go, of something that you hold close
Why you let it stay around, you just don't know, say
Let it Go
Let it Go
Letting go, of something that you hold close
Tried to make it work out, but it won't, say
Let it Go
Let it Go
