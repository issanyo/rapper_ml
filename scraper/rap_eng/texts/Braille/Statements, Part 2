So hello hello, we came to rock your dome
I got my man by my side so I'm never alone
Return to Sender on hiatus, but the fruit still grows
Lightheaded worldwide, see you at the next show
So knock knock, we came to rock your dome
I got my man by my side so I'm never alone
Return to Sender on hiatus but the fruit still grows
Lightheaded worldwide, see you at the next show

Ay yo, I cipher within, endless chapters of information
Put rappers in their place like assigned seating arrangements
Saving for the future, never wasting my wage on instant
Gratification, the ramifications will manifest themselves in (due time)
The moon shines when the sun doesn't
Problems come, you either solve them or run from it
I've done both, humbled to make honest statements
To stay rooted in the truth and stop making excuses
Wounds soon to heal, stay tuned for the update
Of progress, reporting from Portland never conforming
To confusion, that clouds our vision like winter breeze
Love doesn't cost a thing but we can't sin for free
Consequences roam the premises, ready to strike
I rock steady in strife, and not shaken by the night (fall)
For all ya'll in the place, Lightheaded running the race
And I will say it like I mean it till I'm red in the face

So hello hello, we came to rock your dome
I got my man by my side so I'm never alone
Return to Sender on hiatus but the fruit still grows
Lightheaded worldwide, see you at the next show
So knock knock, we came to rock your dome
I got my man by my side so I'm never alone
Return to Sender on hiatus, but the fruit still grows
Lightheaded worldwide, see you at the next show

Cohesive connection, a fleet of rhymes feeding off divine
Intervention, inventing styles that will free your mind
Boggling, heads bobbing abiding to the rhythm
Provision given from Tony Stone, Return to Sender spitting
Splitting atoms and still, haven't released Needles in the Hay
So check the Pure Thoughts and future projects on display
For all the listeners, what a combination
We fellowship on MICs with life giving statement
