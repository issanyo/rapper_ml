Intro
(Piano instrumental)
(Ohmega Watts)
Yes, yes, Ohmega Watts in the house
I'd like to welcome you to the banquet for the broken
Ay yo Braille, there's no turning back now
I think it's time you set the table

(Braille)
Invited to the banquet, I'm glad that you could make it
Invited to the banquet, I'm glad that you could make it
Now, now
Now let me set the table
Now, now
Now let me set the table
Invited to the banquet, I'm glad that you could make it
Invited to the banquet, I'm glad that you could make it

(Verse 1)
And these the questions I ask myself, when I question myself
Why keep rapping, should I put it on the shelf?
What's it really worth to work at this, there's gotta be more than
Self-expression and self-help lessons
I know both sides man when I was yea high
I made music as a hobby, that's where it all started
Now it's my profession so what am I professing?
How do I decide what direction to go it's been
More than a decade, since shades of grey
Now the hair that's on my head got shades of grey in it
And my shades been tinted, rose colored glasses
I could rhyme fast or let the flow go like molasses
Slow it down, let me ease into it
I'm a disciple of the Lord with or without the music
Got me asking why I do this? Tell me the plan
Is it Christian rap music for Christian rap fans?
I make songs for the broken if the shoe fits wear it
For those who could never measure up by their merits
For bad kids in a mad city who never had parents
For those who never pray but say they're praying for Paris
These are pearls for perilous times, why waste it
I feel the weight of the world but I'm weightless
Outer space all my burdens were lifted
And I confirm this by living with the firmest convictions, hah
I was born in the 503, hip-hop junky my heroes were emcees
My heart was cold sub-zero degrees
But God showed mercy to a zero like me
Amputate my legs and I'll still walk with Jesus
When I say my last words, I will talk about Jesus

(Chorus)
Come, all you who want rest
Come, all who search for truth
Come come, all who ran in vain and found dust
Come, you who have been untrue
Come, all who need His grace

(Verse 2)
And I boldly proclaim that it's only by grace
That sinners become saints, holy and saved
I know what I say won't be fully embraced
I stay fully engaged spilling rhymes on the page not
Aiming for fame, I don't got the strength
I dedicate this to the blind, poor, crippled and lame
Simple and plain, an invitation to the banquet it's a heavenly feast
And the end of all anguish
The language I speak when my pen bleeds
Can't leave rap alone, I know who the game needs
I can't promise you a pain free existence
I point you to a permanent hope off in the distance
This is my blood, and this is my body
Through faith in Christ the wicked become godly
The healthy, don't need a doctor the sick do
And It's obvious we got a lot of issues
Bow down, for the King's arrival
The Kingdom of God is no place for the prideful

(Chorus)
Come, all you who want rest
Come, all who thirst for truth
Come come, all who ran in vain and found dust
Come, you who have been untrue
Come, all who need His grace
Come
