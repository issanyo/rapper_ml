Move forward, they lock us up, we lock it up, and ?? give us the ?? to keep going. Let's go

Raise the dead spirits
How can we raise the dead when
They've been gone so long, Please
Bring them back to life
Is it possible to do that?
Zombies in the streets
Their needs have been ignored
Screaming can't you hear this?
Raise the dead spirits

In the destitute land
We cry for revolution but don't execute the plan
Our people get executed instead
The land of the living dead
Pop shots aimed at their head
Lost ones, young sons who got guns, they pull it out
Make them shout when trouble comes
Nobody knows where he got it from
But when it blows he's got us on the run
The block is scared, living in fear
Total paranoia, he takes steroids and the boy is a destroyer
Bullets fly, inflicting his first victim
He said he would kill a second in a millisecond
Red and blue lights flashing
Cops harassing potential assassins
Mamas cry
These kids don't listen well
One in the grave and one in the prison cell

I'm speakin on those that we walk with talk with live with
Those we relate to even just a little bit
Mischievous misfits cops and killers
Every man woman and child that has been delivered
It's not God but made in his image
In the strive for perfection we all lose our pilgrimage
Humble in slum villages peace war and famine
Keep the young dumb and build up more smart cannons
Soft porn and hard landings
Found dead with this ??
Picked him up from a stray bullet
Here a gang bangers standing
Hand in your resignation
Lives cut short from violence stds or disease
Beef and pork
Worked for a living and forget to live
Save every nickel and dime but never give
Die to live live to die
Every life that you led
Lived to see another day
