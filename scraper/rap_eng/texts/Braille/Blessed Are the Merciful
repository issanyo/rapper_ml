Are you merciful? Why?
Because Jesus healed the sick
Because Jesus fed the multitudes
Because Jesus gave legs to the crippled
Because Jesus granted sight to the blind
Because Jesus opened the ears of the deaf
Because Jesus found prostitutes and tax collectors and drew them into the sphere of His love
Because Jesus touched the untouchable
And loved the unlovable
And forgave the unforgivable
And welcomed the undesirable
Because Jesus even now saves the otherwise unsavable, why!?
Because they deserve it!?
When the goodness and loving kindness of God our Savior appeared
He saved us NOT because of works done in righteousness
NOT because we met Him halfway
NOT because we took the proper steps forward
And in good faith have elevated ourselves to the place of the deserving poor
But according to His MERCY!

We are here because Jesus Christ didn't say with cold indifference
"Give them what they deserve, they brought it on themselves!"
Jesus Christ IS the Mercy of God!
And seeing us in our misery and need
He doesn't just feel for us
He takes the necessary action to relieve our distress
He leaves the eternal glory of heaven and the perfect fellowship of the Trinity
He condescends to us
Lives among us
Suffers like us
Dies for us!
Do you understand this!?
Have YOU experienced this!?
How then is it possible to EXPERIENCE it and not DISPLAY it!?
IT ISN'T POSSIBLE!!!
YOU HAVEN'T EXPERIENCED IT IF YOU DON'T DISPLAY IT!!
The evidence of God's mercy in your life isn't determined by how much theology you know
By how many books you read
But by your active goodness to people in misery and in need!

Blessed are the merciful, for they shall receive mercy
