Oh Lord I give my life to you
I trust in you my God
Do not let me be disgraced
Or let my enemies rejoice in my defeat
No one who trusts in you will ever be disgraced
But disgrace comes to those who try to deceive others
Show me the righ path oh Lord
Point out the road for me to follow
Lead me by your truth and teach me
For you are the God who saves me
All day long I put my hope in you
Remember oh Lord you compassion and unfailing love
Which you have shown from long ages past
Do not remember the rebellious sins of my youth
Remember me in light of your unfaling love
For you are mercifull oh Lord

I get frustrated that these scares from my past still cause me to hold back
Cover my shame with a blanket of faith so I don't waste my life
It seems so easy to fall off track
Help me to believe that you are who you say hold me back when I lose my way
I walk a lonely trail sometimes it feels like it's you and me only, the Lord is my witness
Sober minded they offer dranks thanks a lot
If I did drink, last year I woulda drank a lot
And mighta never stoped it runs in my family
It got the best of my grandpa, uncle, and pops
Shake it off, shallow advice
But it takes more to conquere a vice that grips so tight
When I'm low help me remember and put my hope in Christ

And when our minds get filled with lies
We will remember
The [?] get's pulled over our eyes
We will remember
Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide
We will remember
The enemy tries to steal our lives
But, we will remember

Close my eyes act like it never happened
Take my chances like my life is just an accident
Ignore the sorrow
Like the feeling is it real
But never learn how to deal with the emotions I conceal
Let it out
Ups and downs
Character producing
This stress that I carry is ulcer inducing
And ultra confusing
Which way is up
Love doesn't sweep issues under the rug
It faces the reality
They say forgive and forget
Let go don't live to regrets
But someones always left with a mess
How can we erase memories from our head
Where will they escape to
How will I forget when I'm reminded everyday
Every day every morning when I wake up
I'm gonna need grace just to make it
Your grace is the blanket
That covers all my sins and mistakes up
Help me remember
