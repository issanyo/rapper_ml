Trained for this moment since the day I was born
Since before I made tapes that ignored
Since before I had a rap name or started to record
I've been chilling in the back getting prepared for war
I got a strategy, this isn't random rapid fire
This is one shot, headed for Goliath (I can't miss)
Target practice on topics, flipping rhymes off the top
Waiting for this one chance to throw my rock (rock on)
The least expected to defeat the beast
Judgements passed to blast my confidence, I won't surrender or retreat
Return my gifts to the sender, this is worship in the chaos
This is heavy concentration (got my game face on)
An eruption of noise flooding from a mouth of silence
I'm nobody, a spec of dust battling a giant
He stands and mocks me, everyone things I'm crazy
Laughing as if I'm not aware of who I'm facing

Goliath, I sat back and watched for to long
You can't hold me down anymore
Goliath, it's been going on for to long
I'm sick and tired, now I'm taking out the giant
Goliath, I sat back and watched for to long
You can't hold us down anymore
Goliath, it's been going on for to long
I'm sick and tired, now I'm taking out the giant

And his shadow covers the country side, we're dwelling in the darkness
Running away, while he's running things
Calling shots, got us locked in bondage
His threats hold us hostage, afraid to be free from his grip
I can't hold my tongue, I'm holding this stone
Hands sweaty and callus, mentally un-balanced, I'm ready for the challenge
Seen many before me back down and crack under pressure
It's time to take drastic measure, let it loose
Intimidation factor tries to set in, I'm grab my weapon
Not arrogant, but it's apparent that he's feeling threatened
I'm stepping in his direction, the point of no return
With every action backed by the power of words

Goliath, I sat back and watched for to long
You can't hold me down anymore
Goliath, it's been going on for to long
I'm sick and tired, now I'm taking out the giant
Goliath, I sat back and watched for to long
You can't hold us down anymore
Goliath, it's been going on for to long
I'm sick and tired, now I'm taking out the giant

My armor is weak, I don't expect to be hit at all
I'm entering, knowing I'm protected (he can't touch me)
Mental simulations, got me picturing victory
He's snickering and slithering, I'm setting him strait
Full speed ahead, he's surprised by my approach
Probably thinking I'ma try and swing a sword to his throat
But I go for what I know, throw a stone with precision
Accurate and cracking his skull, when it hits it
He's tripping, he's shaking, I'm taking him out
And before he could react he fell flat on the ground
The whole earth shook, I returned to finish him
Chopped of his head and carried it through the villages
The city people cheered, I delivered a speech
They all danced in the streets celebrating his defeat
I said, he was dead, before the battle started
To take him out you just gotta aim for the right target
