[Sample from an argument between a black Trump supporter and anti-Trump protestors]

[Hook]
Hold up, I ain't feelin' yo' energy
(Hold up, I ain't feelin' yo' energy)
Those words, they don't sound like a friend to me
(Those words, they don't sound like a friend to me)
I heard you came to make enemies
(I heard you came to make enemies)
Okay, hand down my penalties
(Okay, hand down my penalties)

[Verse 1]
Hello, love, today the delegation votes
Today we must determine on who is our future foe
I just left a meeting, I've got permission to go
So I choose to use this time to write you a quick note
We've really made some progress on pushing through some policies
Dealing with misogyny, boosting up our economy
Removing nationalism and private prisons
Racism, corrupt businesses, bad religion
We prayed to the Lord above, and we asked Him for wisdom
We made some really tough decisions, but I'm glad we did it
But now I'm starting to notice things are changing our behavior
'Cause every time we meet I think the worst of my neighbors
I feel like our leaders like to argue just for time's sake
When you have no foes, you create 'em. Why do I hate?
I think I understand all the reasons why you left
And me not listening I'm starting to regret
But it's hard to leave now, I have authority
One year from seniority, we'll have a majority
And I'll change things formally and morally
Already things here are much better for minorities
Just pray for me, I'm tryin' to make a difference
I'm afraid I'm not far from being the opposition
Any time we disagree, they just call it phobia
This is how you silence your critics up in utopia

[Hook]
Hold up, I ain't feelin' yo' energy
(Hold up, I ain't feelin' yo' energy)
Those words, they don't sound like a friend to me
(Those words, they don't sound like a friend to me)
I heard you came to make enemies
(I heard you came to make enemies)
Okay, hand down my penalties
(Okay, hand down my penalties)

[Bridge]
We agree we share the same enemy (get down)
Handshakes, lofty words and subtle winks
Marches in the streets and the cries for peace
Everything was good 'til they came for me
(Everything, everything was good) 'til they came for me
(Everything, everything was good) 'til they came for me
(Everything, everything was good) 'til they came for me
(Everything, everything was good, get down)

[Verse 2]
(Hey, talk about utopia)
You askin' bout utopia?
(Is this a safe space?)
I mean, I mean it's a diverse place
But it's still monolithic
Because nobody thinks different
(Nobody thinks different)
I would have somebody's back in the day we would
Try to preserve the traditions of utopia
Others would just look past it, right
So then they told me to run when I wasn't scared (wasn't scared)
Some told me to look, but there was nothing there (nothing there)
Some would tell me when to sing and clap my hands (clap my hands)
And have like rules for entertainment and how I should dance (dance boy, dance)
I just know there was a problem
Everybody wanted to be royalty
Nobody wanted to be servants
Because the peasants they would become privilege and perverted
But be careful how you share your views
Cause they'll protest you
We scream "Power to the people, power to the people
Power to the people" (until that power corrupts)
We scream "The system stay evil, the system stay evil, man
Them systems are evil" (until it benefits us)
They tell me "Give to the poor, give money to the poor"
Tell me "Give to the poor" (First I gotta make a little more)
They screamin' peace over war, there's peace over war
Man there's peace over war (until they came for yours)

[Outro]
You act like a pig and you dirty up the dishes
You talk like a friend, but you a politician
We deconstruct words until nothing has meaning
Disguise our hate with our political leanings
Because we just don't like people
We love evil, we say equal
But we really want the power
Exchange your insecurities with ours
I'm afraid this very hour censorship has turned us into cowards
Nothing is pure, everything is a mystery
You've got no shame, you rewriting history
My apologies don't fit in your ideology
You're trying to build an ideal society
I overestimated my influence
I thought utopia was a place of prudence
I guess I'm foolish
Should I say something, fight back or start running?
Wait, hold up, I think I hear 'em coming
