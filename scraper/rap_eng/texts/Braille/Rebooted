[???]
I got love in my sweat glands
If you monkeys touch my mangoes then I'll smack you with banana hands
We got a plan

[Foreknown Apostolic]
Character study shows that white America loves negroes
So from my black half to my white half, gotta say that I love you too
As I backtrack through the mine shaft I'm stepping on dead canaries
Necessary precautions just ain't my style
I'm a leader in teetering quite maniacally over a violent sea
Even I see the irony in being scared even though my beard is piratey
I refuse to swashbuckle under the pressure
Too scared to be walking the plank and too proud to be swabbing the deck
That's not my role
I'm an intellectual
I've got a wooden pipe and a leather bag and perform in front of a lecture hall
Patches on my jacket so the elbows don't get torn
I've got a mean glare with enough of a bifocal stare to warn
Any potential makers of shenanigans to plan against
Any kind of tomfoolery, horseplay, ridiculousness or hijinks
They try to take the floor but I take the floor away
This is my forum and it's time to start filling them in on what I think
