[Verse 1: Odd Thomas]
Yup, this is a re-introduction plus some practical perspective
For those of us indeed who are in need of complete vision correction
The only thing that’s required is a lens that’s genuinely objective
And a minute of your time to wrap your mind around divine perception
Because even the most mindless and spiritually blind can be the spectator
In the theatre of God’s magnificent design, if you would incline
Your ears and your eyes to these sounds and these signs
We would attempt to rightly refine and align your crooked sight
But we’re not implying that a sunset or an ocean can begin to set in mind
What the Son of Man began to set in redemptive motion
But morals, meaning and devotion, heart, mind and emotion
Substance, significance and truth cannot be explained
Or reduced to a big bang explosion
Because His character and nature cannot be known through natural revelation
Or shown through random acts or figments of your imagination
We, the Beautiful Eulogy, attempt to communicate audibly
And visually to help you hear and see the glory of God clearly

[Verse 2: Braille]
My life is in the hands of Your love everlasting
I start where I finish, pick it back up where I left it
I'm just a man of unclean lips, I've only seen a glimpse
But everywhere I look I see His finger prints, all things were made through Him
We received His revelation so we reflect it when we breathe
And the concepts we conceive are born of spiritual seed
Manifest in the material realm as musical composition
The rhythm of heart beats transformed by the Gospel and Godly wisdom
I'm an instrument of His mercy
Unworthy but still He uses me the Beauty of the Eulogy
Through His death we are truly free, free indeed
The condemnation and the bondage of our sin was abolished
On the cross and He alone accomplished it
God made Himself known exposing His own nature and His glory
Through His Son
The revelation of Our Saviour the fullness of God born in human form
Deity in the flesh we need the Spirit
And the Word to open our eyes so we can see correct; the Vital Lens
