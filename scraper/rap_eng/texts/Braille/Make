[Verse 1]
Yeah
Them creative forces that forged
From dust an entire species
Native forces surged
From muck and mire? Please
Pain that makes the ground fertile to launch artistic movements
Pick your renaissance, Italy or Harlem
Art that steers clear of them squad cars
Stay under that radar
Them tasers sting hard
I've been there
Art that shines bright in a prison
Yo let me tell ya
Elegant, brilliant, audio Helvetica
Mind change with side change, compression it's bliss
Didn't see it, but now I know possibilities endless
Who would have thought something as dumb as rap could spark this
Paradigm shift
He only used one image to (make)

[Chorus]
Came and gathered up the gravel and
Fashioning from mud
Everything we know and love
Lumps of coal
Got soul from JAH's nostrils
Blood bought, mud blood, walked in Terracottas
Something out of nothing
I dare you
And stare straight into the status quo
Like "Do I scare you?"
The mainstream tremble and fall
And point them all to the Savior
Until they all stand in awe

[Verse 2]
So push yourself
Force yourself
You feel the pain?
Lean into it
Growl!
Lose your voice like you mean to do it
The P90x of thinking
Build up resilience
Pen don't give brain breaks
Makes you brilliant
And feast on a catalog
Update your dialogue
Fool, we still build schools of thoughts out of Lincoln Logs
The big homies chew me up [?]
But Hoover used to school me like
Everything in life
You either do it right
Or do it twice

[Bridge]
Homie opt in
Like you ain't got an option
Confirm God's calling like you're all in
When the combined force
Of four horsemen
Forged in Hell's furnaces
Challenge you to face off
Show them what you made of

[Chorus]
Came and gathered up the gravel and
Fashioning from mud
Everything we know and love
Lumps of coal
Got soul from JAH's nostrils
Blood bought, mud blood, walked in Terracottas
Something out of nothing
I dare you
And stare straight into the status quo
Like "Do I scare you?"
The mainstream tremble and fall
And point them all to the Savior
Until they all stand in awe
