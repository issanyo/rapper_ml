[Odd Thomas and Braille]
Limited in mind, limited in body, ruler of our own domain
Claim false authority, like we're the ones who rule and reign
The mentality of the majority is more than metaphorically morphing into a misinformed form of who we were born to be
Torn between, blind perception and divine reality
Torn at the seems, our dreams are built on a faulty foundation of fallacy
This will be our fatality, it's simply a formality
See the casualties of war laid on the floor of the battle scene
We worship how we feel, we don't worship who we should
Yeah we got it bad, and if God calls it bad we call it good
We covet what others have, grab whatever we can, whatever we want, we think it belongs in the palm of our hands, going along with a song and a dance. Worshipping idols to fulfill our entitlement issues
Addicted to the feeling we get when we get what we want so we pick and we choose. Even the air we breathe is a gift we receive that we think we're entitled to
Even the air we breathe is a gift we receive that we think we're entitled to
They say you get what you deserve so we work hard to earn it
Earn as much as we can to determine our self worth and purpose
Identified by what we buy, it's a sad state of affairs
And when we die we loose it all and just lay there, naked and bare
But none of this stuff can cover us, no it never was enough for us
Nothing we can work for to obtain can wash away the stain
The only thing we're entitled to is judgement for the lives we led
There's nothing we can hide behind, in the end we need grace instead

[Odd Thomas]
We spend a lifetime trying to find love in anything and everything this life has to offer it's true
And often times we trade the temporal satisfaction for the things the genuine believer is entitled to
I'm convinced that it's because they don't understand that there exists an order
Of benefits of redemption that's applied to his bride
And the basis of his choice in election was for God alone to decide
And it is not like an "invitation" that one might accept or reject, but rather its the effectual calling drawing to Himself His elect
Regenerating and enabling us to respond in faith toward Christ
Giving us the gift of repentance and revealing the nature of His sacrifice
Binding us with a true intellectual realization of our sinful condition
Converting us and turning us from our previous malicious disposition
Ultimately leading to a legal declaration by God that we've been made right in his sight
Justification being credited to us on the basis of the righteousness of Christ
Adopted to be the children of God and grafted into fellowship
Being bound together by the blood of Christ into a common membership
Sanctified by the spirit given gradual growth in holiness
Increasing in our thinking and behaving in a ways that shows that were chosen
And all the while being preserved and upheld according to his sovereign providence
Giving us confidence that he will carry us to completion just like he promised
