Nightmare walking
She's a nightmare

She got butterfly eyes but I call them bat wings
She bat them things and trap you in the shackling
You want to get in the sack with her
She put you in the body bag pull up the zipper
You say and that's my Boo get her named tattooed
Girl will put you through a nightmare you should call her your BOO
Run away like [?] them spider legs ain't cute the itsy bitsy spider climbing up your spinal cord
Paralyze you when the venom enters your veins
Check her in at the clinic cause she mentally insane
Get yourself checked incase any venom remains
Once it sinks in deep you can never remove this pain
Your heart gets entangled with her [?]
You were walking with a target on your back
She on the attack like a marksmen
This mistress never misses
You'll be swimming with the fishes if she get's you on her hit list
Strictly risky business a sticky predicament
Tricky isn't it she get you into thinking she was into it
This sickening make your stomach turn when you picture it
Lies coming from her lips
Looking like red liquorish

It might sound sorta shocking
It's not a foreign topic
For some the erotic is like a narcotic
Acting erratic the siren song is so hypnotic
You get lost want it at all costs
With her fishnet stockings she a fisher of men
But that's not what the parable meant
It's terrible fell in the trap with the temptress
You couldn't find a catch you got caught it's the opposite
Honey on the lips make the lies sweet
Smells like she's dead but her perfume hides it
She got butterfly knives
Carves her name on your wrist
You get captured by the ball and chain
No ring but you sing when she calls you
And her personal life don't involve you
With all due respect I'll tell you a dark secret
Two become one, so you are who you sleep with
Horror stories, there's a reason to be mortified
When two [?] of the lamb join hands God is glorified
But if you always in bad relationships look in the mirror
And tell me who the nightmare is

Nightmare walking
You're a nightmare
