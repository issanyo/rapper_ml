[Verse 1: Braille]
And for this I'm not fit for the task to craft words with
Adequate passion to match the, size of grace
Beyond anything I can grasp but it grabs hold of me
So I hold on tight and hug it back
Surrounded by grace that surpasses the past
Beyond anything we could hope for or ask
How can words describe the Word made flesh?
The best way to understand Him is to understand His death
What He set to accomplish and fulfilled with every step
He was sent from the Father, God's gift to the world
Gave His only Son to purchase sons and daughters
To make us one with the Son and one with the Father
Took upon Himself the condemnation we deserved
Resurrected after death and He promised to return
Filled us with the Spirit to seal our election
And protect us until the day that we share in His resurrection
The size of grace how great the size?
The gates of Heaven are open wide!
And people of all kind are welcome inside
Should have been denied but instead God replied
He said, in your place my Son has died
His death gave you life it's the size of grace
Innocent blood that was shed to erase
Every trace of sin for a chosen race
It's the great exchange, it's power to change
The Gospel, salvation for ALL who believe
All for His glory, overcoming our hatred and sin with His divine love

[Bridge: Braille and Odd Thomas]
The love of our God, gracious and kind
God became a man and suffered for mankind
The punishment for our sin, was poured out on Him
So we could be forgiven and forever live
Saved by grace the cost was not cheap
We can't add to it, His work is complete
The greatest gift we could ever receive
It's the Gospel, salvation for all who believe

[Outro: Braille]
So we pray for strength of the power of His Holy Spirit
So that Christ may dwell in our hearts through faith
That we would have the strength to comprehend
Together with all the saints
The height, depth, and length
The love of Christ that surpasses knowledge
Filled with the fullness of God
The size of grace
