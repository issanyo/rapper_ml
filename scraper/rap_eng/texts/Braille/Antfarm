[Intro]
If you follow a light down a dark path the path can go anywhere. Eventually leading to a dark end. If you are the light. You are the path

[Verse One]
Identified by an ankle bracelet
Placed in head equipment specialized to make me forget
Be quiet, I benefit observing my past
To go against the grain and watch the world behind the glass
I can't adapt
Perhaps my flesh makes it hurt
With the segregated colony digging in the dirt
What's it worth?
The birth of Earth's eternal nap
Skin peels off my palm as I rub the genie's lamp
Tunnels filled with sap leave ants stuck on stupid
Gathering crumbs, left behind by the morbid
The farms lit yet days to nights they both dim
In quicksand, I'm trying to learn how to swim
Read my lips
It's hard to speak to the deaf
Saying Jesus is coming, I might as well hold my breath
The dead, never recover from my demand
They can't afford their soul so they leave it in the sand
Jesus is coming, my words echo in their ears
The Devil's in a red coat and I'm Paul Revere
Wet knees, they kneel down in sand
Now my tactics reveal to the damn

[Verse Two]
I press my face against the glass module
The fact that I'm alive is the only obstacle
I stumble
Over a crowd of corpse
A nation of fly soldiers, the decaying body source
I pawned a suicide while I'm searching for the reverend
Why does it take 100 years to get to Heaven?
I need seven, paces back but I'm a pawn
I'm starving
Eating associates like Ghengis Khan
It's gone
You're never advised to provoke
It's healthy but goes down like drinking egg yolk
The sun pokes it's way straight through desire
The magnifying glass made you large, you're on fire
I perspire from the aspects redundant
Everything was raised to praise it's bad judgement
Thee advancement in population decrease
It seems the wrong motives keep believers on their knees
And they say...

[Interlude]
You just go on and on and on repeating this process over the centuries
How many roads must a man walk down?

[Verse Three]
They replace my thoughts of the cross with lots
Of theories to leave me lost, I'm lost enough to toss
My morals on the cross till there's no guidance left
Playing tug of war with thin lines between life and death
Had you know I would die then why did I live?
They knew they could sin cause they knew You'd forgive
I sit on conclusions, not knowing that something's wrong
Sometimes I sit and dream just to see what's been beyond
Whatever floats my boat makes hope's remote work
One nation divided by variations of the church
I perch on branches and die with the day
If there was anything I could do I would've done it yesterday
I say Jesus is coming, circle around your tomb
You can't rest in peace without knowing your doom
I assume, it makes sense when it's ended
Now we both wish I follow through with what I've threatened
Pretend you died for a hopeless cause
The Devil is Hitler and you run his Holocaust
