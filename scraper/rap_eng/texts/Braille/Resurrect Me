[Intro x3]
'Cause I think I'm dead
And if not, I'm dying
Bring me back to life

[Verse 1]
Never imagine myself walking in these shoes
The road I was on was littered with many clues
I didn't recognize the signs
I couldn't read them
It was a foreign language
So if you were speaking
I heard the sound
But couldn't interpret the signal
'Cause my ears were not trained
To understand the pitfalls that many talked of
I thought I understood
But I was undermining my understanding
Crash landing
Barely standing
Chaos overrules and overthrows careful planning
So much demanding all of me
Every day all I see is someone or something that needs me
But I got needs too
It's funny 'cause I don't even know what they are
But when I find them I'll probably keep searching for more
Instead of being thankful for what's provided

[Hook x2]
So resurrect me
Oh won't you resurrect me
'Cause I think I'm dead
And if not I'm dying
Bring me back to life

The passion that burned is gone
The laughing just hasn't happened it's all gone
If you ever looked at me and thought I was strong
Sorry to say you were wrong
What went wrong? I don't know
I try to trace back every step I took
I look for your smile but it's somber
I look in the mirror and I'm conquered
Do you concur that this is obscure?
That the perfectly painted picture is now just a blur
My inside gets stirred
I was so innocent
Never knew how bad this life could hurt
And that's why I live like a bird
But now I just live like a burden
I was driven by faith and purpose
Now I hitchhike cause I'm afraid to make a wrong turn

[Hook x2]
So resurrect me
Oh won't you resurrect me
'Cause I think I'm dead
And if not I'm dying
Bring me back to life

[Outro]
Bring me back to life
Resurrect me
Bring me back to life
Resurrect me
Cause I think I'm dead
And if not I'm dying
To bring me back to life
Cause I think I'm dead
And if not I'm dying
To bring me back to life
