You can't filter the filthiness it's fillin every crevasse
Hard to the core and it's oozin out the edges
Balance with no boundaries perfectly symmetric
If you set trip you get your head flipped, effective
Reap what you sow change the whole perspective
Disrespect em get surprised if you get disrespected
Natural law like when gravity falls
But my humanity is not controlled by the those animal instincts discipline displayed
At my disposal are weapons that can blow you
But I'd rather get to know you show you the way
Out of orbit I forfeit my power take yours and absorb it
I could leave you in torture and torment
Or free you from your distorted self portrait
Mixed emotions fixated on fiction
Reality burns more than it bites fight the addiction
Fantasy land price of admission is everything
Enter at your own risk when the dark abyss promises bliss
Listen close the serpent always talks with a hiss

You could get this
When you walk down slowly
It doesn't get lower than this
The only way left to go is

After rock bottom I'm taken off in a rocket
I'm tired of the topic so drop it
I got this toxic venom ready to inflict on the victim
There's enough room for all of us know your place in the system
When planets collide the damage is dynamic
It's a shame when your potential dies from bad habits
I ride sound waves across time and space
You could see the sunshine but be blind to the rays that illuminate
The human status so temporal but the absolute truth is unpenetrable
I put my armor on fend from the fiery darts
You could get lost following stars or if you follow your heart
Deception is deaths best friend
Return from the depths of a dead end
I'm dead set on elevation stand in my position
And no man can come and sway my commitment
