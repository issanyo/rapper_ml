[Chorus: Catalina Bellizzi]
Take it easy love is hard
Walk among us, come from God
Take it easy love is hard
Walk among us, come from God

[Verse 1: Braille]
Shadows, silhouettes, fragments, can’t get a clear picture it’s the image of love
My brush can’t paint the make believe
No, I can’t give it if you already take it
Shoot the breeze but don’t squeeze the trigger
If you got bad aim and your shots are aimless
Never know who you might hit
Might look at what you get and wish you could change it, dang it
Stuck with what you got and it’s a mess
Stains on the floor from the blood, tears, sweat
Grab a bucket and a mop
Clean it up if you got real love
Don’t forget that it never changes
It never stops unless yours is tainted
I’m saying, it might get hard to follow
Through if your words are hollow
I gotta ask, do you really view love the same way you paint it?
Thought it looked nice so you framed it
Then you hang it, on the wall as a decoration
In your house so you see it every day but lately
You wish you could take it down and put it in the basement
Ain’t it funny?
We love each other like we love money
Love each other like we love a sunny day
Puppy love, was it really love?
What was that feeling?
Whatever it was I think it went away

[Chorus: Catalina Bellizzi]
Take it easy love is hard
Walk among us, come from God
Take it easy love is hard
Walk among us, come from God

[Bridge: Catalina Bellizzi]
Teach me the sweetness of something endless
Bring good, bring wisdom
Nothing is painless
Teach me the sweetness of something endless
Bring good, bring wisdom
Nothing is painless

[Verse 2: Odd Thomas]
People tend to follow a pattern of physical attraction
Great first date, second date late night passion
It never lasts long so you keep on passing to the next one
You never really felt the connection
Only physical affection
So you protect your heart and correct your self and self reflect
So the next one you connect with better be better
Than the last one
Because the last one was disaster waiting to happen and the impact was greater than you could ever imagine
So you planned to be more selective with your selections
Love less and be less affectionate
But the fact is the minute you think you mastered it you return right back
To the pattern of what you think love should look like
Maybe you're not finding it cause you're not defining it right?

[Chorus: Catalina Bellizzi]
Take it easy love is hard
Walk among us, come from God
Take it easy love is hard
Walk among us, come from God

[Bridge: Catalina Bellizzi]
Teach me the sweetness of something endless
Bring good, bring wisdom
Nothing is painless
Teach me the sweetness of something endless
Bring good, bring wisdom
Nothing is painless

[Outro: Catalina Bellizzi]
Take it easy (x4)
