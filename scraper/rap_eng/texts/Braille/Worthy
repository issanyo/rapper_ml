[Verse 1: Braille]
What a joy it is to stand in Christ forgiven
Righteousness and eternal life when salvation is given
All my sins paid for and I could never repay You
But now my greatest delight is to trust You and obey You
More than a genre of music, worship is a heart change
I gladly bow my knee to the God who never changes
Every day I'm changing, becoming more like Christ
Adoring what is good, adorned with the fruits of new life
And my hope is not a fantasy, it's built upon a reality
That you will keep Your promises according to Your sovereignty
I will see Your face and be safe under Your reign
When my faith turns to sight and only perfect love remains
Your people are my people no matter where they come from
The church exists according to the works of God's Son
So in the New Creation when we're gathered in His name
It will be obvious that He's the one that's worthy of all fame
Cause the worthiness of Jesus is the reason we belong
So "Worthy is the Lamb" will forever be our song

[Chorus]
Wisdom, Power, and Praise
Glory, Honor, and Strength
Worthy!
To the Lamb who was slain
Be Wisdom, Power, and Praise
Forever!
And to the King on the throne
Be Glory, Honor, and Strength
You are worthy!

[Verse 2: Odd Thomas]
There is a space between us, it's a right divide
Distance between the depths of Your worthiness and mine
Mine is derivative, all my worth comes from Thine
I am merely a man, all Thy works divine
I abide only as a branch attached to the vine
That grows the beautiful fruit that gets crushed into wine
I am the least deserving made worthy to touch His feet
The servant that did nothing to earn a seat at the wedding feast
I'm a created being, You created everything
You make footstools of fools and galaxies Your rings
You are Christ the Consummate, my hope and every confidence
Worthy to receive praise from every mouth and every continent
Infinitely worthy of loyalty and my allegiance
Worthy enough to die to self, to offer my obedience
Worthy is the Lamb, worthy is the Son of Man
Worthy is the One who takes the scrolls from His holy hand
Where angels and elders and living creatures all fall
And worship the highest King, the most worthy of all

[Chorus]
Wisdom, Power, and Praise
Glory, Honor, and Strength
Worthy!
To the Lamb who was slain
Be Wisdom, Power, and Praise
Forever!
And to the King on the throne
Be Glory, Honor, and Strength
You are worthy! [x2]
