Sick of the thought of all the battles that I fought
Tangled up intestines and my stomach's in a knot
When will I learn my lesson wrestilin' with flesh and blood
I've fallen so far behind it's like I'm never catching up
Ambition in my belly so I take a bigger bite than I can chew
But now it's to late to spit out my food
Swallow my pride take the bitter pill
When I feel hypercritical and hypocritical combined
A bad combination
Birds of a feather weight afraid of heights
So they never elevate or fly
The fear of failure
Make you scared to even try
Cause you so selfaware that your're not quite there
I learned the hard way like it was a Broadway
Show went broad daylight and everybody saw
They probably talking right now I hear voices in the background
When I turn the track down down
Every scar in my repertoire
Is a reminder for my weakness leading me back to Jesus
Oh how I need his mercy and grace always
We all fall short and I learned that the hardway

That the lesson that I learned
It don't have to be that way
You better work it out
I learned the hard way

Look, sharing life's ills while the ink spills
From the independent will
Where do I begin
My hands take a walk
They talk with my skin
Feel the scars from all of them hard lessons of my sin
Put it in laymens
I thought my game plan was better than the one of who's image I was made in
Making my own choices
Instead of heading his voice
Kid, I went and mixed a cup of that poison
Scotch felt so good till the morning
But was only scotch taped till what an earth quake had broken
Pain outweighed what I gained in enjoyment
Dang, and I cold have a-voided it
But, you gonna suffer no matter what lane you choose to take
The pain it changed or the pain it just staying the same
So while you wrestle with the choice
Thank good cause only one leads to joy
I love the father tell heâ€™s good boy not to put his hand on the pot cause he know the joint hot
And we get all burned up he just don't want us burned up
But, sometimes it takes a good hour to get learned up
