[Intro]
Simple message is so clear it's complex
Simple message is so clear it's complex
I'm [?] this dimension
I'm extra equipped during the evil invasion, the evil invasion
Simple message is so clear it's complex
I'm [?] this dimension; complexicated
I'm extra equipped during the evil invasion

[Verse 1]
I speak candidly and don't mask nothing
Lay my cards on the table
Way past bluffin'
No poker face
Treat me like a joker
But I'm over the debate
I know I'm holding an ace
Flame thrower trying to gas my head
I stay sober pavin' the way with no payola
Fame is a lame motive
I aim to remain ultra
Beyond the status quota
Padded envelopes with my pen and pad quotes
'Cause I been bad since your favorite album covers had ropes
Gold chains for you dull frame
I'm in the zone through my own thang full swang
Heavy hitter always ready to deliver
And I bring my girl with me if we get a babysitter
That's a complexicated situation right there, yes sir

Simple message is so clear it's complex
I'm [?] this dimension
I'm extra equipped during the evil invasion, the evil invasion
Simple message is so clear it's complex
I'm [?] this dimension; complexicated
I'm extra equipped during the evil invasion

[Verse 2]
Every word I serve is so pertinent
Sounds real deep with some pain and some hurt in it
I got time to kill this is how I murder it
All your enthusiasm, I'm curbin it
That sounds worldly when I put some earth in it
But please don't curse the gift
'Cause the gift is making room for me, yeah
Blessed man but I'm not a blind one
A worthy challenger no I couldn't find one
For God for me
Plenty up to par
But how you gonna battle Bill Gates with pennies in a jar
I got the word in my heart
But my memory is scared
Spirit is willing but surrendering is hard
Trying to fight this war won't get me too far
'Cause I'm not even sure who my enemies are

[Hook]
Simple message is so clear it's complex
I'm [?] this dimension
I'm extra equipped during the evil invasion, the evil invasion
Simple message is so clear it's complex
I'm [?] this dimension; complexicated
I'm extra equipped during the evil invasion

[Verse 3]
I see vultures in the sky 'cause I smell like death
But I got abundant life his mercy is fresh
I wonder around on this forsaken land
Where truth is hard to find like a faithful man
I guess I got big shoes to fill
Never abuse the power of my musical skill
If the needles don't hit you then Cupid will
Giving up is stupid putrid and ill
The male ego is frail and feeble
I pale in comparison to him, Braille's evil
Are you surprised that I'm flawed like David and Paul
With thorns in my flesh and all
I went through hard times like "poor me"
But I survived to tell this story
To God be the glory
Perseverance produces character
To God be the glory

[Hook 2x]
Simple message is so clear it's complex
I'm [?] this dimension
I'm extra equipped during the evil invasion, the evil invasion
Simple message is so clear it's complex
I'm [?] this dimension
I'm extra equipped during the evil invasion

Complexicated
