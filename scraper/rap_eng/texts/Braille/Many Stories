I have to be deliberate when I deliver this
The words are on the tip of my tongue
Lips quivering
It's not cold outside but my body is shivering
And the skin that I'm in is shaken deep to the core
I'm pacing the floor like I have a nervous habit
And I'm an anxious person but that's not the reason why
It hurts to be a husband, seeing your wife cry
Concerned for her emotions while I'm tripping over mine
Holding my baby during the first day of her life
Doctors come into the room saying something isn't right
They couldn't tell us why
So they started running tests at the ICU with wires connected to her head
The imagery was intense, we just kept on praying
Trying to stay calm, but in my mind it was mayhem
We faced it as a family
Never alone
And I was smiling when we got to bring our baby girl home

If I could tell you all my stories
Then you would realize in yours it's not over
I've been through so many battles
And I almost lost myself, but now I'm back
Now I'm back again

I was in Portland writing this song
Then I got a call that something was wrong
It never crossed my mind that you might be gone
Cause you were so young and your will was so strong
On my way to the hospital
I was driving slow
Didn't really think it was your time to go
When I arrived, I was calm, asking what happened
They said after the cat scan I can chat with the chaplain
And he's telling me you had a major stroke
A vessel in your brain stem suddenly broke
Took me to your bed, now it's just me and you
Father and son in the emergency room
I said a few words
You couldn't even speak
The only reason you're breathing is from a machine
I'm always gonna miss you, but God gave me peace
Letting go of regrets, holding on to the memories

If I could tell you all of my stories
I'm sure you have many of your own
