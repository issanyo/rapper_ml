Oh oh oh, Nobody make noise
Nobody raise your hands to the sky
Oh oh oh, Nobody reach out
Nobody touch it, what you gonna do
Oh oh oh, Nobody make noise
Nobody raise your hands to the sky
Oh oh oh, Nobody reach out
Nobody touch it, what you gonna do

Daily double trouble all around, he got a bubble goose
When they shoot, he ducks down
Avoiding the forces destroying the fruits of his seed
Employed by the streets he was working for free
Motivated by greed, green sacks he would smoke up
And sell to common folk who like toking (smoking) it, on the reg (regular)
Ay yo, shots fly he pray one, reach his head
Blood pours he caught on in the leg, now
Where he run to, crippled, simple minded
Lived in the city and, dreamed of dying
Promoted death, with every single breath
But now his breath is getting short and he's scared
Shaking in his boots as he pulls out his hair
Got what he wanted but he wasn't prepared
Crying, realizing he don't wanna die
He's nobody, and me and him are so much alike

Oh oh oh, Nobody make noise
Nobody raise your hands to the sky
Oh oh oh, Nobody reach out
Nobody touch it, what you gonna do
Oh oh oh, Nobody make noise
Nobody raise your hands to the sky
Oh oh oh, Nobody reach out
Nobody touch it, what you gonna do

When the rain falls down, nobody seeks
Shelter for the storm, or strength for the weak
Nobody wants peace from the violent wind
Nobody wants to escape this, life of sin
When children cry, nobody wants to help
Nobodies true to others, nobodies true to self
Nobody shares their wealth, mentally and physically
Spiritually and so forth with, faith in God
Nobody wants to live, nobody wants to fight
Nobody chooses sides standing for what's right
Nobody sees color beyond black and white
Nobody shines so even the blind can see the light
Nobodies leaving behind all the pain from the past
God's willing to help, nobodies willing to ask
God's willing to help, nobodies willing to ask
If only nobody would take off the mask
Oh oh oh, Nobody make noise
Nobody raise your hands to the sky
Oh oh oh, Nobody reach out
Nobody touch it, what you gonna do
Oh oh oh, Nobody make noise
Nobody raise your hands to the sky
Oh oh oh, just call me Nobody yeah
And I'll be ready when they say that Nobody will do it

When the rain falls down, Nobody (I, me or you) seeks
Shelter for the storm and strength for the weak
Nobody (I) wants peace from the violent wind
Nobody wants to escape this, life of sin
When children cry, Nobody wants to help
Nobody is true to others, Nobody is true to self
Nobody shares their wealth, mentally and physically
Spiritually and so forth with faith in God
Nobody wants to live, nobody wants to fight
Nobody chooses sides standing for what's right
Nobody sees color beyond black and white
Nobody shines so even the blind can see the light
Nobody is leaving behind all the pain from the past
God's willing to help, Nobody is willing to ask
God's willing to help, Nobody is willing to ask
Nobody just take off that mask

Oh oh oh, Nobody make noise
Nobody raise your hands to the sky
Oh oh oh, Nobody reach out
Nobody touch it, what you gonna do
Oh oh oh, Nobody make noise
Nobody raise your hands to the sky
Oh oh oh, Nobody reach out
Nobody touch it, what you gonna do

Uh, it goes daily I wrestle
See me on stage but I'm nobody special
Just call me Nobody yeah
And I'll be ready when they say that Nobody will do it
Uh, it goes, daily I wrestle
See me on stage but I'm nobody special
Respond if you feel it
A generation of Nobodies waiting to be revealed
