[Intro]
We all
We all
We all
We all

[Verse 1: Lee Green]
It’s the battle of ages
If we ever could try to measure the terror that’s evident
Then it would shatter the cages
In a balance of wages
That this payment
Sin shackled and chained it
To the back of our brain and we actin’ insane if
We actually vain as we grapple for change and we prove that we trapped in enslavement
The devil wants our bellies full to consume earth then waste it
Not knowing that, we feed to die like the cattle that grazes
See we were made to crave, I believe that is true
Adam was a slave of love before he had a clue
See we do what we like (like) cuz we like what we do (do)
Father God, change our wants so we are slaves to You

[Chorus: Lee Green]
We all
We all surrender, yeah
We all
Either to death or for life in the Lord
We all
We all surrender like slaves
We all
But sin is death, He is life OH

[Verse 2: Odd Thomas]
This is a pragmatic axiom
We were born into a system, automatic slaves and addicts
And whether you believe it
It’s just a matter of whether you consider it compatible or problematic
But if you honestly acknowledge the logical conclusion
For you to choose your destiny is a delusion
Cuz when you examine the general system of living
It proves who’s your true master and who you’re enslaved to
And it’s true that since the fall
We’ve all been taught a false view of freedom
And a rebellious mind recoils and is inclined to deny him
And bind him with the ties of treason
Either rebellion or righteousness
Both lead to the inescapable mark of eternal life or death
Bound to sin or bound to obey
Either way we’re both slaves, one kills, one saves

[Chorus: Lee Green]
We all
We all surrender, yeah
We all
Either to death or for life in the Lord
We all
We all surrender like slaves
We all
But sin is death, He is life OH
We all
We all
We all
We all

[Verse 3: Braille]
Dear descendants of Adam and Eve
We’ve been contaminated with a disease
The infiltration of sin is deep in our nature
Peel back the layers
It’s no secret
Even the naked eye can see it under careful examination
No exaggeration needed
These are exact statements
We are dead in our offenses
We can’t pay penance with petty possessions
No exceptions or exemptions will be made
Nothing independent of true repentance and redemption
Deserving the death sentence
We earned it by our own merits
Inherited from our parents
Pride and arrogance
Endlessly in error is the best way to describe
Our rebellious lives as blind derelicts
On what basis should we escape judgement and condemnation
If we get graded on a curve, who is worthy of God’s favor?
If He is righteous and just and the wages of sin is death
The only way for us to live is if someone perfect dies for us
How else can the spiritually lifeless rise from dust?
From the worst to the least of sinners
The truth hurts but let it simmer until your soul surrenders control
The goal of faith is to believe that we need to be saved
And then rejoice knowing that our Savior came
Died in our place and His sinless life was raised from the grave
Our sin is death, Christ is life
Either way all of us are slaves
One kills, one saves
