[Verse 1]
How long it take before the sky will crack?
How long it take for time to buy us back?
What's the price to find a chiroprac?
What's the price to find the rifle that
Emptied out inside the back and called it freedom
How long I gotta wait for them to calm the demons?
Inside the place that made the place to stay for legion
How long I gotta groan for when they pledge allegiance?
Time out
How long I gotta pray for patience?
How long I gotta pay for education?
How long I gotta debate with the racists?
On both sides we both cry for better days
Man could you ever pray for God to come back before the bullet came?
Did you wanna have to die for us to say your name?
Sandra you took the blame
We still hangin' onto every word you said
God we still strangers in this world you said was dead
God

[Verse 2]
How long I gotta be afraid?
How long I gotta wrestle with my ways?
How long I gotta wait for you to save?
Some family doesn't even know your name
I'm handling the blasphemy with grace
While standing on they grave
How long before this body's done away?
How long before this body can't complain?
How long before the body sees the face?
They kept him while they cried they had to say
Maranatha
Maranatha uh
How long it take before the sky will crack?
How long it take for time to buy us back?
What's the price to find the chiroprac?
What's the price to find your final lap and finish it?
You paid blood and the witnesses clouding my space
How long 'til I'm out the way to lay aside
Find the race and run for it
Run Forrest while you lookin' behind
Like your perfecter of faith
Ain't run forward
The Son's sure to come back just wait for Him
The waves form when the page tore when
The saints swore it gave 'em hope
The same story he wrote
He prayed for you he won't
Delay longer and
Hope sustains don't I know it
It's hard to show it
How long I gotta bear it in faith?
How long before you carry me weight?
How long before they bury me? ...wait
How long before you take me away?
Away, away, away, away, away, away, away, away, yeah

[Outro: John Tucker]
Might be night
But the Son's coming back
Might be night
But the Son's coming back
Watch the time
Keep yourself on track
Yourself on track
Yourself on track
Might be night
But the Son's coming back
Might be night
But the Son's coming back
Watch the time
Keep yourself on track
Yourself on track
Yourself on track
Might be night
But the Son's coming back
Might be night
But the Son's coming back
Watch the time
Keep yourself on track
Yourself on track
Yourself on track
