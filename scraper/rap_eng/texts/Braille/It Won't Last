Count the cost, I'm gonna make this life count, before I'm down for the count
Count the cost, we're gonna make this life count, before we're down for the count

We, struggle and fight, through the dark of night
And the sharks that bite will give you scars for life
See the stars and stripes, we salute
A never ending pursuit of truth it's true
The permanent we're after, persevere when disaster strikes
Shining light when we're smashing, smashing MICs
And stay focused on the after, after life
Cause if it won't last it's not worth the price

It's all live, dead alive, stage dive, resurrect for recreation
Re-create, re-structure, set the record strait for restoration
Constant temptation, I'm set apart and separated
Every step we take, elevates us towards the final destination
Determined and certain the words in the sermon are serving a purpose
Lifting the burdens, if your searching I'm sure it's worth it
To seek the surgeon, defeat the serpents and circumstances
That lurk below the surface waiting for a chance to murk us
Infectious infections, the tongue is a lethal weapon
That can either destroy you or bring protection
Who's the enemy? Who's injecting our seeds with greedy eyes
And feeding minds sugar coated poison, disguised as vitamins
Vital signs of the times are evident, most are hesitant
To realize, the seven headed dragon spitting fire speaking lies
But I will rise, receive the spiritual prize
And not waste my life chasing temporary highs

We, struggle and fight, through the dark of night
And the sharks that bite will give you scars for life
See the stars and stripes, we salute
A never ending pursuit of truth it's true
The permanent we're after, persevere when disaster strikes
Shining light when we're smashing, smashing MICs
And stay focused on the after, after life
Cause if it won't last it's not worth the price

Count the cost, I'm gonna make this life count, before I'm down for the count
Count the cost, we're gonna make this life count, before we're down for the count
