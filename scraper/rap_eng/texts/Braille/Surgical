[Intro]
It's just a friendly game of operation
Look at me now just laying here

[Hook]
Sometimes you gotta bleed
And smell your own blood
So cut me open
If this is a surgery

[Verse 1]
I'm just strapped down to a operation bed
And everyone can see where I bled
And cry when I bleed
And take turns cuttin' away
To extreme for TV; the camera cuts away
Take the focus off me when I feel the most broken
I think about Terry Hulk Hogan Jon and Kate Plus 8 and tabloid gossip
Phantom of the opera zombies and monsters
We walk with our heads high
The dead alive double mind it double or nothing
We can only choose one side
I'm totally tongue tied
Crumblin' my words
Stay humble and serve
But I stumble and swerve
Crumble when I hurt
I'm not numb to the pain
I could feel it but I gotta let it wash down the drain
I am not the first man to walk in these shoes
Many different roads and pathways to choose
Free will yeah the choice is yours
Can't walk by sight
'Cause my eyes get sore when I really want to soar
Fly above this
Fight against lust and discover what love is

[Hook]
Sometimes you gotta bleed
And smell your own blood
So cut me open
If this is a surgery

[Verse 2]
Lord please cloth me in righteousness
Look away I don't want you to see me like this
I don't want to walk away from this life prematurely
I can never return once once I leave too early
I'm living for God to be a pleasure of him
But it's hard to bear fruit during the season I'm in
I refuse to let the deceiver win
I'm the light of the world even when it gets dim
I'm the salt of the world even when I'm salt and pepper
My lonely heart's so broken and tender
Join the club upgrade your membership
Get saved before the grave is your residence
But I would not reside in the slow
With my bones lonely but never along
I feel like I'm trapped in a nightmare
And I can't wake up until the princess will kiss me
Let myself return to empathy
When I'm full of self doubt empty me
Fill me up I'm on bended knee
When I repent and turn the temptation flees
I am not afraid of the darkness
The darkness is afraid of me
The heartless they envy me
So there is no room for envy or jealousy in me
What's gonna matter when it's over?
I carry that weight upon my shoulder
Who I am as a man a husband a father and son
Strivin' to hear well done
In all of the above
'Cause I only got one life
I only got one life
And I can't do it over
