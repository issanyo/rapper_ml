[Verse 1: Odd Thomas]
On that day we will sing of the Name more excellent than angels
A purified bride
A refined heart, speech and mind
Where unity and fellowship is perfected in the church
Where divine love
Rests in the hearts of the inhabitants of the new earth
And receive a crown only to cast it down
At the feet of the resurrected Jesus
In a perfect ceaseless form of worship. Singing
Glory!
To the liberating King who came not to conquer kingdoms
But conquer hearts and restore
Men back to what they were intended for
And escape from this life marked by anguish
A great fountain of love that flows from heaven's gates awaits us
You can take this world
It's joys, and it's fleeting pleasures
But give us Jesus, our future hope and our greatest treasure
The fulfillment of our expectation
With nothing to separate us
Nothing to hinder the saints
From the greatest expression of adoration
Finally fit with language to describe
With the right words to express
The richness of eternal possession
The blessing of inheritance
Where God will be seen through purified eyes
Purged from the sin that blinded us from viewing God as glorified
Where love will be expressed with the perfect affection
Until then, we wait with expectation for all that we will acquire
In heaven

[Verse 2: Braille]
Lord
You did everything required to save us and bring us
Into Your presence so to know You and behold You
Is our hearts desire
There is nothing higher
Nothing greater to acquire
Holy, Holy, Holy
Is the song of the choir
Your people sing Your praises
Gathered from all the nations
We were chosen to be holy and
Blameless before the earth's foundation
And it's only on the basis of Your glorious grace
And we will never grow tired of gazing upon Your face
And falling before Your feet
Worshipping at Your throne
Your appearance is like carnelian and precious gemstones
Like nothing we've ever seen
Your glory never fades
The Lamb of God who was slain to wash away sins stain
We were ransomed by Your blood
Your loss was our gain
And You live forevermore
Lord
Forever You will reign
The King of all Kings
Name above every Name
And everyone who trusts in
You will not be put to shame

[Short Instrumental]

[Outro: Josh White]
O Jesus, King most wonderful
Thou Conqueror renowned
Thou Sweetness most ineffable
In whom all joys are found!
O Jesus, Light of all below
Thou Fount of life and fire
Surpassing all the joys we know
And all we can desire
May every heart confess Thy name
And ever Thee adore
And, seeking Thee, itself inflame
To seek Thee more and more!
