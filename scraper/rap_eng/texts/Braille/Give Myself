I give myself, is that enough for you?
I will give myself to you
I give myself, is that enough for you?
I will give myself to you

[Verse 1]
She got a face like a porcelain doll
And her big brown eyes make me feel so small
Porcelain dolls are so fragile, she breaks when she falls
But I will catch you, that’s what I promise
She got a smile that could light up the room
The smell of her perfume got me high as the moon
The way she moves entices, but stay away
I'm convinced I could kill a man like Cyprus
And she knows that I would die for her
But that wouldn’t save her soul so I live
Give myself, I know I’m not Jesus, but
I wanna love her like he does
This is free love, it only works two ways
You can accept what I offer, or throw it back in my face
And I take this woman to be
But I don’t wanna take from her, I wanna give myself
And all that I have, to have and to hold, for as long as I live
I give myself and all that I have
To have and to hold, for as long as I live, I give

[Hook]
I give myself, is that enough for you?
I will give myself to you
I give myself, is that enough for you?
I will give myself to you

[Verse 2]
She looks good even when she don’t try
Everyone tells her but she doesn’t know why
I said ‘Girl, if you lived in the sky
I would buy a telescope just to look in your eyes’
She laughed a lil’ bit and she brushed it off
Brushin’ her hair it’s so black and soft
She said her hair is just like her heart
It might look strong but it’s fallin’ apart
And she knows that I got love for her
I spend my life making sure I’m the one for her
She was with me on almost every van or bus
You’re not a fan of me, you’re a fan of us
The man I’ve become, husband and daddy
I wanna make these two beautiful girls happy
I wish that I could offer the world
But all I got is these words and a promise to give myself
And all that I have, to have and to hold, for as long as I live
I give myself and all that I have
To have and to hold, for as long as I live, I give

[Hook]
I give myself, is that enough for you?
I will give myself to you
I give myself, is that enough for you?
I will give myself to you

[Verse 3]
She's got a face like a porcelain doll
Her big brown eyes make me feel so small
She got a smile that could light up the room
The smell of her perfume got me high, high...
And she knows that I would die for her, but that wouldn’t save her soul so I give myself
And all that I have, to have and to hold, for as long as I live
I give myself all that I have, to have and to hold, for as long as I live, I give

[Hook]
I give myself, is that enough for you?
I will give myself to you
I give myself, is that enough for you?
I will give myself to you
