[Intro: Citizen Aim and Beautiful Eulogy]
A one two, a one two
A one two, a one two
A one two, a one two
I'm a, a come home to you, to you

[Verse 1: Citizen Aim]
Waiting for the first touch
The first meet, the first chance
Knew it had to happen
Sealed it at the first glance
And where 'n when from then
Was out of our control
Souls danced together when warmth
Brought us inside out the cold
A new experience
New relationship
New after thoughts
Found an avenue to cross
To lead us to our section marked to
Weary reside sign
Where our hearts fly fine
Perched high above the heaven
Is where moonlight dies to sunshine
Resurrected in these feelings and emotions lost
Got a fresh chance for the desires of my days that brought me
New attitude
And a new identity
And humans prove him wrong and move
'Fore we show him what we came to do
Written in our destinies before we roamed the earth
Before we learned what hurt
What words made the feelings burn
I swear I soothe your swords
And mend the wounds that won't close
Let me close let me hold
I promise I'll fix those

[Hook: Citizen Aim and Beautiful Eulogy]
Step up in my chariot, girl, and we gonna fly away, fly away, fly away
Up into the heavens, leave this world and we gonna fly away, fly away, fly away
Step up in my chariot, girl, and we gonna fly away, fly away, fly away
Up into the heavens, leave this world and we gonna fly away, fly away, fly away

[Verse 2: Citizen Aim]
I love the way your hips rock
The way your body's non stop
Motion with the curves
Movement ever flowing this spot
Is where I wanna be
For the rest of my existence
Hold you in a firm stance
Your like [?] of my missions
Leave your name up on my train
It's cherish never buffed off
When left a clean slate
A blank space
Where you can write thought
And then I'll soon respond
With an open ended love letter
Catching myself staring at your beauty makes me feel better
To see your shadow lets me know comfort's on it's way
You feel my battle and my pain still you don't delay
With honesty your heartfelt words can make my heart melt
Pick up pieces catch, the reasons why I love you more now
Than day 1, its grown, blossomed to a newer height
Let your light shine
Measure, count the times it just felt right
So when my chariot arrives at your doorstep
Step on in, close the door behind you feel the sun set
