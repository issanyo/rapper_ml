[Art Azurdia]
Let’s suppose that a kite could come to life and develop its own personality.  On the one hand, it would feel the exhilaration that comes from the surges of wind that direct it through the sky. On the other hand, it would almost immediately take notice of something annoying. The tugging of the string at its centre; a feeling of constraint; resistance. And soon the kite begins to think to itself, “If only I could detach, then I could really fly.”
To the kite you see, its seems that the string is limiting its full experience of freedom. But as any boy or girl who has ever flown a kite knows were that string to suddenly snap, the kite wouldn’t soar freely for very long. It would dart to and fro for a minute; maybe two; but very soon thereafter it would end up on the ground in a pile of broken sticks and torn paper never ever to fly again. Rather you see it is the taut line between the kite and the one holding it that enables the kite to fly. It allows all the principals of aerodynamics to come into place so that the kite might achieve its full purpose
Christian love performs the very same function as a kite string. You take away the stabilizing force of Christian love and every towering gift, every supernatural power, every sacrificial act, every musical performance; you name it friends; it will all, all end up on the ash heap of eternal insignificance without love
