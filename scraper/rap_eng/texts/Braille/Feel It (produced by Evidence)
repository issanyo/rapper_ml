[Intro]
You feel it…
You feel it…
You feel it…
You feel it like braille

[Hook]
You feel it like braille
You feel it like braille
You feel it like braille
(And I can feel it)
(And I can feel it)

[Verse 1]
Deep breath as I cross the street
What’s on the other side right across the street
Double crossed, homie had a cross on his necklace
Thought I could trust him, cross examination
I take back the last statement, boiling point
I could feel the lack of patience, planning some habitation
Panic and passive hatred go off the top in the battle, get decapitated
They don’t hurt you on accident, it’s all premeditated
They had it all planned out (out)
I wanna fly away, but I can feel gravity and the depravity of my humanity
I feel trapped in a bubble or square
Then I complain like the struggle ain’t fair (it ain’t fair)
Cities’ destroyed by tsunamis, different forms of despair
Like my issues don’t compare

[Hook]
You feel it like braille
You feel it like braille
You feel it like braille
(And I can feel it)
(And I can feel it)

You feel it like braille
You feel it like braille
You feel it like braille
(And I can feel it)
(And I can feel it)

[Verse 2]
I let the cat out the bag my life was getting hard
It’s still raining cats and dogs on the boulevard of broken dreams
Chasing after light beams (light beams)
Staying close to my shadow (shadow)
Keep your enemies close
Raising my daughter in a broken home (broken home)
And when she’s not with me, I’m just home alone
Might get a few calls on my mobile phone
But I keep it on silent when I’m in the zone (ha)
I zone out when the beat coming
Speak life over death that’s why I can’t sleep, cousin
Face problems like a man can’t keep running
Blood, sweat and tears, you really wanna bleed from it
This is my job, I keep my shirt tucked in
But I never punch out, sometimes I punch in
I feel the weight of this fallen world, I know you feel it to
The Lord is my refuge, redemption and rescue

[Hook]
You feel it like braille
You feel it like braille
You feel it like braille
(And I can feel it)
(And I can feel it)

You feel it like braille
You feel it like braille
You feel it like braille
(And I can feel it)
(And I can feel it)

[Outro]
You feel it like…
You feel it like…
You feel it like…
You feel it like braille
