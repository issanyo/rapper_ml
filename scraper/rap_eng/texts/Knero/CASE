VERSE 1( MOTAKI)

Let me use this verse to sound a warning./
She always dey figa, motaki motaki but sey the flow is boring./
You Diss me at night but you always get vim! to text in the morning./
How you fit chat-Ah!/
Boggie, menners always dey my case top./
I’m at the peak of ranks the game’s top./
Talk about the trophies that you made up./
Yet you still push me I’ll stay at the same spot./
Name the top ten with someone above me./
I’m The Rap King, Pride Rock dang it Mufasa Motaki./
Never try to claim my spot or I swear it’s gonna be bloody./
As I’m counting stacks and you dey chat plus abacus./
You fit dey my case,  but you always stay under us./
You always dey chat but you’re too scared to come for us/
Motaki dey call shots and they call me Guns R’ Us./
The rap game’s a jungle and I go Nasty. See./
What makes you think you could drop a verse than me./
Motaki’s got bars fit to spin you sum degree./
Take a bullet from us my paddy, you can’t be me./
