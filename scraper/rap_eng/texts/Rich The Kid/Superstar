[Intro]
(Crowd cheering)

[Chorus: Matthew Santos]
If you are what you say you are, a superstar
Then have no fear, the camera's here
And the microphones
And they wanna know, oh oh oh, yeah

[Drop]
If you are what you say you are
Yeah

[Verse 1: Rich The Kid]
Count a hundred bands when I'm waking up (hunnid)
The hard was on the ground, had to pick it up (yeah)
Baby, I'm a star
Yeah, horses on a car
What? Pulling up in a new foreign
Wrist for my bitch boring (my bitch)
Most of your wrist torn
Too fly? I'm sorry
Yeah, she want a nigga like me
([?] on BET)
Look at my diamonds in 3D (three)

[Chorus: Matthew Santos]
If you are what you say you are, a superstar
Then have no fear, the crowd is here
And the lights are on
And they want a show, oh oh oh, yeah

[Verse 2: Sha Mula]
(Sha M)
I'm a star for real
Catch me outside, no Dr. Phil
I'm Harden, bitch, when I'm balling against
Slam harder, remember I'm not your kill
I'mma hit that top spot
I cut fake niggas off like crop tops
They catch this fade, no high top
And I'mma slide in your bitch like Cha Cha (yeh)
I know you said you are
But you are not a star
We all about the Kareem
It ain't no Abdul, and it ain't Jabbar (we balling)
They way I make these bars
These haters hating hard (they hating)
They can hate me hard
If I aim for the stars
This shit gonna take me far

[Chorus: Matthew Santos]
If you are what you say you are, a superstar
Then have no fear, the crowd is here
And the lights are on
And they want a show, oh oh oh, yeah
