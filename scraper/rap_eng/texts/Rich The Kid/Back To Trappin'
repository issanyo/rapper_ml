[Chorus: Rocket Da Goon]
Wrap the work, wrap it up in plastic
In the jungle, she gets jurassic
In the 'Rari, sliding with the Ratchit
Make the work disappear like magic
If rapping don't work, I'm going back to trapping
If rapping don't work, I'm going back to trapping
If rapping don't work, I'm going back to trapping
Wrap the work, wrap it up in plastic
In the jungle, she gets jurassic
In the 'Rari, sliding with the Ratchit
Make the work disappear like magic
If rapping don't work, I'm going back to trapping

[Verse: Rich The Kid]
I pour the pint clean, you sippin' that fake Lean
The chopper got red beams, my Activis too clean
50 racks in my pocket, she on the pill, taking off like a rocket
Me and Rocket, in the club, yeah, I got it
Bad bitch want a lil' bit of Scotty
Wrap the work up, ship the dope out
This the trap house, I got racks now
Told your lil' bitch to come here, Gucci, that's all on my underwear
I'm sippin' the Lean, no Belvedere
I pull out that chopper, spray everywhere

[Chorus: Rocket Da Goon]
Wrap the march, wrap it up in plastic
In the jungle, she gets jurassic
In the 'Rari, sliding with the Ratchit
Make the work disappear like magic
If rapping don't work, I'm going back to trapping
If rapping don't work, I'm going back to trapping
If rapping don't work, I'm going back to trapping
Wrap the march, wrap it up in plastic
In the jungle, she gets jurassic
In the 'Rari, sliding with the Ratchit
Make the work disappear like magic
If rapping don't work, I'm going back to trapping
