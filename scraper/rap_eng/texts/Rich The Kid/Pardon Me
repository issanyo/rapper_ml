[Intro: Rich The Kid]
Big boss shit
You feel me? shit
Forever ever, forever ever

[Chorus: Rich The Kid]
Pardon me, you said that we would never be
But actually, we made it here eventually
We got the money, it's time to flex
Fuck it, my ice on my neck
Pull up the 'Vette, count up a check
Pardon me, you said that we would never be
But actually, we made it here eventually
We got the money, it's time to flex
Fuck it, my ice on my neck
Pull up the 'Vette, count up a check

[Verse 1: Famous Dex]
Ah-pardon me, man this boy is so broke, huh
I got a bitch with the most
Baby girl why you so mad, man cut off her throat
Ah-pardon me, I get the money like lottery
Don't bother me, she suck me so good, no slobbery
Wait, look at my wrist and get blind
Don't trap where you stay, that's a fine
Baby I'm one of a kind
Almost so broke, got it up in the summer time
Don't bother me, sippin' on lean can't fall asleep
They callin' me
These bitches they buggin', they follow me

[Chorus: Rich The Kid]
Pardon me, you said that we would never be
But actually, we made it here eventually
We got the money, it's time to flex
Fuck it, my ice on my neck
Pull up the 'Vette, count up a check
Pardon me, you said that we would never be
But actually, we made it here eventually
We got the money, it's time to flex
Fuck it, my ice on my neck
Pull up the 'Vette, count up a check

[Verse 2: Rich The Kid]
I gotta flex on 'em, I drop a check on 'em
You ridin' a wave homie
I pull out the K on 'em
I was just hustlin', trap with the customers
Whip out a fifty and double it
Bust in her mouth and she lovin' it
Too many hundreds, I'm duckin' the government
Ooh, what, everybody wanna sound like us?
Pinky ring yeah that's a blizzard, had to freeze it up
Pull up, I don't even have no neighbors
I can't keep one bitch, I'm way too player

[Chorus: Rich The Kid]
Pardon me, you said that we would never be
But actually, we made it here eventually
We got the money, it's time to flex
Fuck it, my ice on my neck
Pull up the 'Vette, count up a check
Pardon me, you said that we would never be
But actually, we made it here eventually
We got the money, it's time to flex
Fuck it, my ice on my neck
Pull up the 'Vette, count up a check

[Verse 3: Jay Critch]
Excuse me, they know I got the blue cheese
New freezer, I just cashed out on a new piece
KFC, I got chicken like a two-piece
Them bitches seein' me, turn your wife into a groupie
But she can't stay with me
Spend the night and then she lose me
They like who he, countin' all the paper, all the loose-leaf
In a new V, I might just go pull up on like two freaks
My life a movie, rock Balenciagas, not no two-threes

[Chorus: Rich The Kid]
Pardon me, you said that we would never be
But actually, we made it here eventually
We got the money, it's time to flex
Fuck it, my ice on my neck
Pull up the 'Vette, count up a check
Pardon me, you said that we would never be
But actually, we made it here eventually
We got the money, it's time to flex
Fuck it, my ice on my neck
Pull up the 'Vette, count up a check
