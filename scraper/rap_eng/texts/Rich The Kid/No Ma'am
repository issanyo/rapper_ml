[Hook: ILoveMakonnen]
Mama called me on the phone, ask me if I'm still trappin'
I'm like, "No ma'am"
Heard the house still boomin' and you're still gift wrappin'
Know I won't slow down

[Verse 1: Rome Fortune]
Aye, Mama said you're goin' too fast, nigga slow down
Ain't seen a red light, no po-po 'round
Your ho 'round, she go down, she low down, she low down
Spend the night with me? Hell no, no ma'am
I just wanna live life
Fuck it, you can spend night
Fuck it, live a big life
Fuck your best friend's wife twice, yes
Hopped up in the Benz like twice, yes
Turn two times to a thrice, yes
Too much cheese for your mice
Two piece for you bitch, yes
Oh she fill the sheet, sheet, sheet
Oh she finna cheat, cheat, cheat
Oh she fill the sheet, sheet, sheet
My phone ring, now momma!

[Verse 2: Rich The Kid]
Mama called me on the phone, asked me if I'm still trappin'
I take your bitch but you don't know what happened
Mothafuck 12, I've been ridin' with a chopper
It's about to go down
Flooded my Rollie, I'm droppin' a hundred
Niggas, they mad cause I'm rich, I got money
Swerve in the 'Rari, ain't slowin' down
Trappin' and trappin', got  plenty pounds
I was layin' in the bed with three bitches
Groupie hoes like the feds, take pictures
Still trappin', lil' nigga, my money up
Rich and Makonnen, we whip it up
Trap jumpin' so I'm still in the kitchen
I got hoes butt naked cookin' fishes
Lotta Os on the check cause I'm winnin'
Me and mama ridin' 'round in a Bentley
