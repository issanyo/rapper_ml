[Hook: Rich Homie Quan]
Me and Rich The Kid going crazy
That's on Jesus
Nutted In this nat-nat ho and told that bitch abort my baby
She ain't going for that, I said she not going for that
Tried to convince her with a Mercedes but this bitch just want my babies
Why these hoes just gotta be crazy?
I don't want nothing to do with her but
She not going for that, I swear she not going for that

[Verse 1: Rich Homie Quan]
Going for it
I'm showing for it
If its far down you know I'm going for it
I got 40 on me, I got this 40 showing
I beat that bitch you on, and she got shorts on
Louis V shorts on, RED.!!
Louis V torch on, RED.!!
Flag hanging showing on her, RED.!!
Any problem with 9 deuce, Your Dead.!!
F showing, no Fendi nigga
And she ain't going for that if you ain't spending nigga
I swear ballin getting boring
If you love her never ever show it
She'll take advantage of it if she know it
Take her round Atlanta just like a tourist
(Who you with)

[Verse 2: Rich The Kid]
Tried to kick her out the crib but the bitch ain't going
I'm Rich she know it
Shawtie tryna fuck around and have my baby, she must be crazy.!!
I cannot buy you no Louboutin, Cuffing and Loving and Doing it
Pull up in rari then coupe again, i ride in a jet when I'm traveling
They want you fugazi I ain't going for that
I live on the block where they trapping at, come to the trenches we jumping the fences, in the bed with two bitches they back to back
In the mall my pockets so sloppy
Rich nigga In a new Bugatti
I done caught your bitch out the lobby
Look at my diamonds they out the safari
Still going crazy, all this gold like the 1980's
Bitch say she want a Mercedes I told that ho she can't play me
Told her get the fuck out she ain't going for that
They asking me where is my ceiling at
I'm finally rich I ain't going back
Your bitch in the kitchen she whippin' that
(Whip)
