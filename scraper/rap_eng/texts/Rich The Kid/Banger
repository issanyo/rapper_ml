[Hook]
Young nigga all I make is banger
5 mill for a deal that's banger
If it don't work selling dope banger
Imma Pull up on ya plug banger
If shorty is a jawn bag her
I see her smoking on the lawn banger
Aye I pull up on these niggas banger
Young nigga young nigga banger

[Verse 1]
Club going banger banger
On the couch I got stamina
Travis Scott when my shit play
Woulda thought I don't got a brain
In the section with your main thing
She upset she not my main thing
Club cuffin not my main thing
3 Cubans thats chain gang
Fake friends yelling gang gang
Cheesing hard like Jonny dang
Behind ya back throwin' dirt on ya name
Behind ya back how I peeping game
Behind the back how Im passing hoes
High and back going high and up
Blunt rolling going back and fort
Bruh I'm rolling going back and fort

[Bridge]
What's that weed that's in your blunt? banger
Jugg rich like I'm coca vango
Yellow Rollie look like it taste like mango
Realest nigga you can call me Django
Aye, aye, banger
Aye, aye, what banger
Aye, aye, banger
Yea, yea we got a banger

[Hook]
Young nigga all I make is banger

[Verse 2: Rich The Kid]
I got a truck with a banger
Run up on me you in danger
Aye
I treat that bitch like a stranger
I flex that bitch like a gymnastic
Stretch the work like plastic
I make the brick do magic
The trap I abracadab it
Young nigga pull up with a banger
Bentley but I got a truck
All of my hoes stuck up
I fuck her and bust in her butt
Money long like a bus
Bad bitch I can't trust
You gon put the cuffs on her
Smoking strong marijuana
Fuck your bitch and I'm a goner
Maserati when I roll up
In the foreign doing donuts
I'm walking my pockets too swole up
I might buy that bitch a new benz
I might fuck that hoe and her friends
Bitch I'm walking with a 10
(???) and they twins
I got a truck with a banger
I got a truck with a banger
I got a truck with a banger
Run up on me you in danger
Aye
I got a truck with a banger

[Hook]
Young nigga all I make is banger
5 mill for deal that's banger

Imma Pull up on ya plug banger
If shorty is a jawn bag her
I see her smoking on the lawn banger
Aye I pull up on these niggas banger
Young nigga young nigga banger

[Verse 3]
They only come around when you up
Stay focused on going up
You not worried bout wats in my cup
You just a bottle girl tryna come up
Want me for money I'm broke tough luck
Leaching on dudes 'till they done up
I paid my dues and never let up
I'm preaching that news for you bless up
Started up from the bottom
I came from below the bottom
Dark nights like Gotham
Them shits not forgotten
The world cold now it's autumn
This time is mine and its audemar
I'm outta this world I'm up to Mars
Tryna school you like seminar

[Bridge]
What's that weed that's in your blunt? banger
Jugg rich like I'm coca vango
Yellow Rollie look like it taste like mango
Realest nigga you can call me Django

[Outro]
I don't know what them hoes had against me
Now they thirst and I'm hot see how shit change
Oooohh they tried to play me
Ahhhhhhh they overlooked me
I don't know what them hoes had against me
Now they thirst and I'm hot see how shit change
Oooohh they tried to play me
Ahhhhhhh they overlooked me
Young nigga all I make is banger
5 mill for deal that's banger
If it don't work selling dope banger
Imma pull up on ya plug banger
