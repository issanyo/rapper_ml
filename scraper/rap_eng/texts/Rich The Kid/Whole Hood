[Chorus: Rich The Kid]
They used to hate on a nigga when the kid was down
Now they see me up in crucial throwin' money on the ground
The whole hood show me love now (love now)
The whole hood show me love now
I used to be the jit, now they say I'm the shit
And now I got the juice, so boy, I know I never quit
The whole hood show me love now (love now)
The whole hood show me love now

[Verse 1: Rich The Kid]
The whole hood showin' love to a real young nigga
Gettin' money by the minute, but it better come quicker
Used to kid me in the west, or up in College Park
On the south side, nigga, better watch out after dark
Better watch out where you park 'cause they gonna check your whip (skrr)
Got some niggas bangin' Blood, got some niggas bangin' Crip
So don't start none if you don't want none
If you don't got a gun, then bitch, you better run

[Chorus: Rich The Kid]
They used to hate on a nigga when the kid was down
Now they see me up in crucial throwin' money on the ground
The whole hood show me love now (love now)
The whole hood show me love now
I used to be the jit, now they say I'm the shit
And now I got the juice, so boy, I know I never quit
The whole hood show me love now (love now)
The whole hood show me love now

[Verse 2: Sy Ari Da Kid]
Uh, yeah

Stripes, no shell toe

Paid in [?]
Raised in the trenches
Nigga, how you thuggin' when your shades is prescription?
Wishin', I get paid to rap shit
On a mission, LiveMixtapes and DatPiff
Got a redbone hoe on the north side, that bitch grimy (skrr)
On my Barack, I gives a fuck about you [?]

[Chorus: Rich The Kid]
They used to hate on a nigga when the kid was down
Now they see me up in crucial throwin' money on the ground

And now I got the juice, so boy, I know I never quit
The whole hood show me love now (love now)
The whole hood show me love now

[Verse 3: Rich The Kid]
Okay, the player hate the game
You hatin' 'cause you lame
Boy, I'm chasin' after paper, give a fuck about the fame
Give a fuck about your bitch, give a fuck about your clique
Nigga, try me like a hoe, and you gon' end up in the ditch
They used to hate on a nigga, hate on a nigga
Now they main hoe callin', and they wait on a nigga
Ain't it funny how things turn around?
I left your hoe at the store, and I ain't finna turn around

[Chorus: Rich The Kid]
