Hit a hunnid band juug?! Meet me at the safe house
(Aye flip whatchu wanna do with these ten bricks?)
Flippa!, stash em in the stash house
Got rich wid me, floatin' them bales, leavin' no trails
It's clientelle, just wanted to sell your brother will tell
Keep a bad bitch in my safe house strictly for cookin'
No dates! Fat ass, no weights, she work the wrist good
No breaks, keep whippin b, don't get outta place, I can't take you on dates
Got cash like Bill Gates, you want a white plate, then its a flat rate
Scope out yo place, run in' yo crib, go crack the safe
Chopper to yo face, get on the floor, nobody safe

Trap house, a.k.a. it's a safe house
Got rastas with choppas, my niggas, they mobbers

You know you ain't say you get it
Pow! Glaw!, hit a nigga with extensions
Kickin shit witcha bitch at the condo
Young nigga got stripes like a bar code
Yeah my nigga Flippa, we the Wells Fargo
I'm a real street nigga, check the bio

I'm smashing these niggas like Mario
Real street nigga don't like the camera
I'm kickin' boss shit up in Canada
Got a pistol on me nigga, imma challenge ya
21 years old, had a challenger
I hate these pussy ass rappers
I'm shootin' you first then yo manager
Leopard Giuseppe's, walkin' around with a mammal
Eat a fuck nigga like cannibal
