[Verse 2: Rich The Kid]
I fucked your bitch in some new Chanel
Wasn’t in class, I got saved by the bell
Too much heat like nacho
New Rari, I pull up with Guapo
Hit the dab one time, now they jackin’
Bricks disappear, what the fuck happened
Made a mil off rap, still trapping
Walk around, Rick Owens, still dabbing
Look at the watch, it’s my time
Had the [?], I walk with a dime
I smashed your bitch and forgot about it
I just got shot by the paparazzi
Flip like a gymnast, she pop a molly
Rich The Kid on fire, better tell somebody
Been in the trap, make it work
Trappin’ it up, got to work
She put the key in her purse
I’m off the Xanny and Perc
I just came up from the dirt
Bitch got a strap in her skirt
Ridin’ ‘em out like Obama
Was broke, I got too many commas
Got rich off a digital scale
I just got a brick in the mail
