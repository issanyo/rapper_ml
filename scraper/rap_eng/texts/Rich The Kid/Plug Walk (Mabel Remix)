[Intro: Rich The Kid]
Ayy, ayy

[Chorus: Rich The Kid]
Plug walk (plug walk, plug, plug)
I don't even understand how the fuck my plug talk (huh? what, what?)
Pick him up in a space coupe, I don't let my plug walk (skrrt, pull up in a space coupe)
New freak, had to cut my other lil' bitch off (ooh, ooh, lil' bitch)
50K, you could come and book a nigga for a plug walk

[Verse 1: Rich The Kid]
You can't reach me (what?), space coupe like E.T
It's the plug tryna call me (skrrt, skrrt)
I was up trappin' early in the morning (plug)
Ooh, on the wave like a du-rag (du-rag)
Pussy nigga callin' for his boo back (pussy)
Plug walk, Gucci on my shoe racks (Gucci)
Walk up in the house, hit a rat-a-tat
'Til I ran into the plug ('til I ran into the plug)
'Til I ran into the mud (to the mud)
I done ran into some racks, I done ran into your girl (your girl)
Why the plug show me love? (Show me love)
I done came up from a dub (huh?)

[Chorus: Rich The Kid]
Plug walk (plug walk, plug, plug)
I don't even understand how the fuck my plug talk (huh? what, what?)
Pick him up in a space coupe, I don't let my plug walk (skrrt, pull up in a space coupe)
New freak, had to cut my other lil' bitch off (ooh, ooh, lil' bitch)
50K, you could come and book a nigga for a plug walk

[Verse 2: Mabel]
I been smoking so much lately, yeah, I'm a fire
I know all the secrets and the rumours, I'm a wire
So don't waste my time, been on my line now
I ain't gotta tell no one, they know you a liar
You don't know the kinda plug I know
You ain't got it the way I got mine, yeah
Rolling easy everywhere we go
Head to every fingertip designer

[Bridge: Mabel]
Plug walk, we ain't got no time for faking or the small talk, yeah
Plug walk, we ain't got no time for faking, let the money talk
Plug walk, we ain't got no time for faking or the small talk, yeah
Plug walk, we ain't got no time for faking, let the money talk
You say you wanna get connected
Wanna roll with the collective
Pardon, wanna be selected

[Chorus: Rich The Kid]
Ayy, plug walk (plug walk, plug, plug)
I don't even understand how the fuck my plug talk (huh? what, what?)
Pick him up in a space coupe, I don't let my plug walk (skrrt, pull up in a space coupe)
New freak, had to cut my other lil' bitch off (ooh, ooh, lil' bitch)
50K, you could come and book a nigga for a plug walk
