[Hook: Trippie Redd]
I don't know a thing about pain
I just keep on sippin' my drank
Swear I don't know shit about pain
I just keep on sippin' my drank
Swear I don't know a thing about pain
I just keep on sippin' my drank
I do not know shit about pain
I just keep on sippin' my drank
Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah Aye
Sippin' my drank, Sippin' my drank

[Verse 1: Rich The Kid]
She wanna sip Act', I told her get back
Back of the Maybach she lose it
She go stupid, I cannot love her no Cupid
Pickin' up [?] for a check
Money counter, drop a cross on my neck
Sippin' drank, couple pints on a jet
Bitch bad, Imma teach her to flex
100K in my Loui', Pull up on you [?]
Please don't touch on my cup it got lean in it
