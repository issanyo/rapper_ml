[Hook: Rich The Kid]
I'm that nigga she could spend them bands with
Look at all these rings, I won the championship
Running with the check like I got Nikes on
Baby told me please put down that Styrofoam
I'm that nigga she could spend them bands with
Look at all these rings, I won the championship
Running with the cheque like I got Nikes on
Baby told me please put down that Styrofoam

[Verse 1: Rich The Kid]
Sippin' on the drank, I'm looking like I'm sleep
Switching bitches and they kissin', I'm in love with freaks
Look at my neck, wet, I got to flex
The king was never at school, I ran up a check
Been trapping the same spot
I dropped a Benz on a watch
Bitch gon' suck it or not, still got the dope in my sock
I made a mill with that same wrist
Niggas gon' hate and it don't mean shit
Drinking the cup with the Actavis
My little niggas strapped like a terrorist
Since I got the cheque, I had to ball on 'em
You say you got the shooters, you can't call on 'em
Bitch I know you broke so you gonna run your mouth
Play with me, I pop up at your momma house

[Hook: Rich The Kid]
I'm that nigga she could spend them bands with
Look at all these rings, I won the championship
Running with the cheque like I got Nikes on
Baby told me please put down that Styrofoam
I'm that nigga she could spend them bands with
Look at all these rings, I won the championship
Running with the cheque like I got Nikes on
Baby told me please put down that Styrofoam

[Verse 2: Slim Jxmmi]
Yeah break a bitch back, break a bitch back
Feel like Slick, Rick without the eye patch
Hoe you know that I put my city on the map
If I want her I'ma get her and I promise that
I look like a nigga with a lot of racks
I fell into some money, don't know how to act
Running with the cheque like I got Nikes on
I'm Slim Jxmmi, but my money long
Benjamin's, Benjamin's, 'em my only friend
You don't wanna race me nigga I am in the Benz
I am an Olympian, Iâ€™m going for the win
You know how I do it man I'm speeding on the freeway
Spend a whole bag on her like it was a B-Day
Eat that pussy good man I gotta call it mean, baby
All these rings, feel like MJ
All this money, she don't care what her friends say

[Hook: Rich The Kid]
I'm that nigga she could spend them bands with
Look at all these rings, I won the championship
Running with the cheque like I got Nikes on
Baby told me please put down that Styrofoam
I'm that nigga she could spend them bands with
Look at all these rings, I won the championship
Running with the cheque like I got Nikes on
Baby told me please put down that Styrofoam
