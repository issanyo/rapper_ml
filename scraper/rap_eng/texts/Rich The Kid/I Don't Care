[Hook: Rich The Kid]
I told that bitch I'm a player
I got money everywhere
Flexin' so much make 'em stare
We throw the racks in the air
Water on me, that's clear
Make her suck it anywhere
I'll make your bitch disappear
Fuck up a check I don't care
I told that bitch I'm a player
I got money everywhere
Flexin' so much make 'em stare
We throw the racks in the air
Water on me, that's clear
Make her suck it anywhere
I'll make your bitch disappear
Fuck up a check I don't care

[Verse 1]
Check (check), flex (flex!)
They done gave some money to the wrong nigga
Fuckin' a bitch in the bank too
Ya ain hatin', but you broke like ooh
Cashed out on a Lamb, my might buy two
I got a check, everything brand new
Pick up the phone, call Will Smith
Looking for a stake in Philly
Fresh off a jet, I'm the prince of the bity
All my bitches has some titties
Too much lean, need a new kidney
She sucking my dick while the roof missin'
Whoa, check, yah
I got Karrueche on the texts
Made half a mil, dropped the shit on my neck
Balenciaga, put a lamb and I'm bent
Broke and bougie dumb bitch she a bird
Forgiatos, foreign scrapin' the curb
No friends, I was trappin' the first
Pussy good, I'mma buy her a purse

[Verse 2]
Water..., drip...
I got a chain from of grip the jewler
Niggas plottin', gotta stay with a shooter
Boyfriend, broke fuckin' a loser
Money short, like I'm pissing a ruler
More ice, you can't fit in a cooler
Vlone Thug stay with a ruger
Bankroll, stretch
Overseas they still hatin'
Goyard and they stay with the paper
Red bitch gave me top in the A.M
Doors up, let me fuck in a Lamb (skuurt!)
I don't trust niggas, they bogus
I'm in Paris, money on me
Broke boy, stay away
Fuck up a check that I made today
Tellin' ya
Overseas for the bands, Australia
I told that bitch I'm a player
Hittin' malls by the pairs
Don't come around, you a square
Blue cheese everywhere (rich!)
