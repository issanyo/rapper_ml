[Intro: ]
You hear that?
It's a whole lot of money in this shit
Damn swag


[Hook x2: Rich The Kid]
I get a square for cheap
50 a show at least
Bought her Patek Philippe
You broke 'cause your bands are creased
50 bags cash out I'm back in
Ain't doing no features I'm taxing
She sucking me up I'm relaxing
They hating I'm flexing the baggage

[Verse 1: ]
They hating I flex in a Maybach
Don't fuck with my niggas we stay strapped
My diamonds they rocky like asap
Just came to Ruth's Chris where my steak at
Out in LA you know I'm with Rich
He changing my neck it's yellow like piss
I'm having the racks I walk up in gift
I'm fucking your bitch just hitting a lick
Hold up wait Louie V duffel
I got that shit from the muddle
I'm fucking your bitch I don't cuddle
I stay in some pussy but stay out of trouble
Damn these niggas be hating
Because I'm so young and my diamonds is skating
Free my daddy
Fuck all these snakes they like statements
When I'm in Philly I'm cooling the meet
I got to grind just to get that Philippe
I just spent 30 thou on this new piece
Don't need a receipt
A foreign a feet
I'm foreign a whip
Hop out them foreigns and shit
He be [?] on me taxing
Took the PJ you know I'm relaxing

[Hook x2: Rich The Kid]

50 bags cash out I'm back in
Ain't doing no features I'm taxing

[Verse 2: Rich The Kid]
I get a square for cheap
Straight out a pint I'm sleep
My niggas playing for keeps
The Bentley was bought no lease
Can't fuck with these rappers they pussy
Stuffing the back of the back with a cookie
I'm back with a mac for the money
That's water my wrist dasani
All blue faces
Givenchi with no laces
Fuck her one time now she famous
I came up from nothing I finally made it
Flexing 'cause my bag right
Goyard hold a pint of the act right
They calling me Diddy
You kissing her mouth but I bust on her titty
A foreign a simply
I'm already rich so these labels can't pimp me
The loud with some
Pull up with a barbie
Shoot her some car keys
I brought her to Arby's
Money old like Sega
You can't ever play a player
Rich Forever that's the label
I won't ever ever save her
