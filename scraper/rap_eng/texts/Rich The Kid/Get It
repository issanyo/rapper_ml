[Intro: Rich the Kid]
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
You know what time it is
Im fucking geek'd, it's 12

[Chorus: Mally Bandz]
Ooh yeah (talk that shit) ooh yeah (rich forever shit)
Ooh yeah (huh huh) ooh yeah (huh woah)
Ooh yeah, ooh yeah (x2)
And my momma said i'm gon' get it, i'm gon' get it (yuh)
I'm gon' get it yeah i'm gon' get it

[Verse 1: Mally Bandz]
I know imma get it
Pitch a hoe then you know that i'm dippin'
Pour it up, soda i'm sippin'
Rari look like it's missing an engine
That's my bitch she ain't nothing but a pigeon
She said she religious, she suck dick like she just won a ribbon
Hundreds blue, nigga no I ain't crippin'
Bitch I ball like a Piston
Diamonds fighting like they Sonny Liston
We sold out, I don't think they can listen
Know some niggas still up in the kitchen
And no they ain't washing no dishes
Call up just so you swam with the fishes
Spending 2K i'm forming bridges
These niggas burning they bridges
Me, I cannot do no switchin'
My shooter pull up with precision

[Chorus: Mally Bandz]
Ooh yeah, ooh yeah (x4)
And my momma said i'm gon' get it, i'm gon' get it
I'm gon' get it yeah i'm gon' get it (x3)

[Verse 2: Rich the Kid]
Huh
Rich forever on gang imma get it (what)
Grab the pot with a fork imma hit it (whip)
You been rapping ten years need to quit it
I was 17 driving my Benz (skir skir)
Talk money, 'rich forever' on the chain now
Got your bitch ass up with her face down (lil bih)
Hit a lick on the plug that's a touchdown (plug)
Fuck nigga, they were hating got a check now (huh)
Ooh she wanna give me the coochie
I wanna bust on her boobies (bitch)
Ooh bet you i'm gon' get the top
Top down in the coupe (skir skir)
I'm with Mally, she want molly
Me and my niggas hit a lick and split it (we split it)
I was broke but now i'm gon' get it (gon' get it)
New freezer got my wrist on fridges (rich)

[Chorus: Mally Bandz]
Ooh yeah, ooh yeah (x4)
And my momma said i'm gon' get it, i'm gon' get it
I'm gon' get it yeah i'm gon' get it (x3)
