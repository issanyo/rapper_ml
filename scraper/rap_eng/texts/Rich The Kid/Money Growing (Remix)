[Verse 1: Rich The Kid]
All of this money be growing!
I got your bitch and she going
She bussin it open
Look at my wrist that's snow
Made me a millie off blow. What?!
I got the gas like a gas station
Made me a millie they hating
I got your bitch and she waiting
Fucking that ho we ain't dating
I got more buzz than a jam
The lean I move like a snail
White bricks are pale
A lot of white broke the scale
I got your ho and she nervous
Broke bitch want a Birkin
Fuck your ho now she squirting
Hit it once leave her hurting
Lot of racks like the bank though
Cooking dope in the safe though
Trapping gas need a elbow
Need a front I'm like hell no
Phone on one percent
One shoe pay your rent
Got a Masi now in debt
Still money well spent!!

[Verse 2: Ponce]
All of this money be growing
All of this money be growing
I'm stacking the do'
I might pull up on your ho
She take off her clothes
Her panties end up on the floor
All of this money be growing
Love with the do
I drop my ex for a O
She want me to work a nine to five, but I'm too busy out here playing the snow
All of this money be growing
About to go and cop a foreign
Tired of these niggas sleeping on me, I'm a kill em' while they snoring
I get the jug from my woe
He stay on the low
Shotgun right behind his door
If you step he let it blow
Wrong move lose your soul
It take a toll
All of this money be growing
Yea, all of this money be straight shit
Chain and watch Presidential
I just finished the election
In love with money fuck my exes
Bad bitches love the flexin'
Swear to God I love to fill up banks, fill up banks like the Fresh Prince

[Verse 3: Riff Raff]
Smoking sweets in Manhattan
Hashi Tashi tv's taller than Bin Laden
All them jewels I been had em'
Now I'm in Aspen
Million bubbles in my Benz bubble bath
Ain't going in public much, because
I got a Versace attitude
Never watch the news
I got a Beradama watch
Looks like a DVD set of Blue Clues
Roll the window down half way
Put my Rolex in the sky
Sky box see watching the jazz
Jezzy bitches always flashing they ass
Role boy in the back in the back of a Jag
Right hitter like Rodger Clemens

[Hook]

[Verse 4: Dash Flash]
All of my niggas they know
Walk in the place and we shut down the show
Type of nigga that be taking your ho
All about business I'm focused on do'
Been through it all in this life I'm a pro
I catch you slipping then I'm laying low
He was sneak dissin' now he slumped on the floor
Cop everything when I walk in the store
Your money shrinking well my money grow
No competition I'm sick with the flow
To me she say yes and to you she say no
The difference you kiss her I just get some blow
Spend all my cash then I go get some more
Waiting for you to go die like a crow
My brothers they ride and they ready to roll
They hold it down while I'm gone they parol
I say fuck a whole city I'm taking the globe
I just travel the world and don't stop like a probe
If you backstab me I move like a drone
Getting that money I'm moving alone
Don't need that fake shit all up in my zone
If you a fraud then you not in my phone
I'm the type to get you hit with the chrome
He feel like he went and got hit with a stone
Acting all tough but soft like you foam
I just rock Bape and stay fly in the Vlone
Got a bad shorty she stay in my home
She cry like a puppy I give her the bone
All of the diamonds and fly shit is shown
Made it happen I just learned on my own
As a young nigga still had to be grown
Dominican and I got love for my Zoes!!!
