[Intro: Hass Irv]
You think this is funny
Yeah, yeah
Hassy, Hassy, Hassy Irv
Ahh, ahh, ahh
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Hook: Hass Irv]
I just told the doctor please prescribe me for some lean
I got me a bad bitch, I might buy her a Céline
That ass look fatter than them racks inside my jeans
I was so damn broke, I got that bag, I almost screamed

[Verse: Rich The Kid]
Pussy so clean, I just might buy her Céline
She want a ring, I just might give her a bean
Put in a wraith
Ooh, I just might bust on her face
You want a case?
Cuff the bitch, I'ma fuck her and break
Too much of that lean
I might break her spleen
Bentley truck or 'Rari when I pull up on that scene
Ohhh, Balencies, told her fuck me, bitch don't diss me
The neck, please
Pussy ride me just like jet-skis

[Verse: Hass Irv]
The jacket Supreme, so I gotta get this shit by any means
Paper was coming in slow, so now I'm just running it up with the team
Rich said "The world was yours"
So I called him up and I'm chasing my dreams
Mo money, mo problems, so I'm rolling up and I'm facing my weed
Flex up, flex up, flex up bless, hoo
I got a new bag alert
There, Hassy up next year
Huh, you looking mad and you hurt
Bitches want to stress us
But we putting the money and family first
What you spent on dinner for your bitch times seven is what I spent on a purse
Hop in the booth, don't rehearse
Count up the blessings, no church
I feel asleep off the syrup
Got some codeine on my shirt
I beat it up with no shirt
Shorty still got on her skirt
Told her the sheets were Versace, ho, be careful when you squirt
Hop in the V and go skrrt, skrrt, skrrt, skrrt

[Hook: Hass Irv]
Hey, I just told the doctor please prescribe me for some lean
I got me a bad bitch, I might buy her a Céline
That ass lookin' fatter than them racks inside my jeans
I was so damn broke I got that bag I almost screamed

[Outro: Hass Irv]
Ayy, ayy, Hassy Irv
Hassy, Hassy, Hassy, Hassy Irv, ayy
Ayy, Hassy, Hassy, Hassy Irv, ayy
Hassy, Hassy, Hassy Irv
