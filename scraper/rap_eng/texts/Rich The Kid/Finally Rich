[Shorty Fresh]

Trap, Trap

Young nigga gotta trap
Pull up in the Phantom with the Forgiato rims
Two ho's, and they kissin' in the back
She poppin' the molly, she know that I'm rich
She flippin' & doin' them trick's
Walk in my mansion, and bitches are doin the dishes
You see how I live
These dollars I'm a mu-fuckin rich nigga
Give a fuck about a bitch nigga, rich nigga
[x2]

I been had a milli
These hater's they watchin they copy
I trap out the vacant
Momma said nigga be patient
I stayed in the trap and I made me a milli
My bitch is fuckin a bitch
Is fuckin my nigga look at my wrist
Livin like Tony Montana
I ride in the Mozzi
I switch to the poor Panemera
Fuck is you thinkin?
My young nigga hit you with Hollow's
You will not see a tomorrow
Real nigga pull up in the Range Rover
You a broke nigga fuckin' on the same ho
I'm a ball in the mall like Mutombo!
I tell you fuck nigga you stuck in your feeling's
I ride in the Rari, no ceilin'
Droppin' the top in the bently
Rich nigga stepped in the buildin'
Bitch I bags to the ceiling
I got diamonds on my neck
Your chick she fuckin' the rip
I walk in the room and she strip
They talkin' bout Q.C. the label
But they know that we rich
Young nigga I trap out the Benz
The trap it jumpin' Shawn Kemp
You nothin' but a shrimp
Ridin' round with 2 ho's and they kissin' in the back
Young nigga with a sack, Rich!

Young nigga gotta trap
Pull up in the Phantom with the Forgiato rims
Two ho's, and they kissin' in the back
She poppin' the molly, she know that I'm rich
She flippin' & doin' them trick's
Walk in my mansion, and bitches are doin the dishes
You see how I live
These dollars I'm a mu-fuckin rich nigga
Give a fuck about a bitch nigga, rich nigga
[x2]

Give a fuck about you.. or your feelin's
Young nigga worth a billion
The kitchen she whippin that Lindsay
Countin the benji, you envy
Laughin, I'm sippin' and drinkin' the pink
Broke as the bitch, there no gas in your tank
You ridin' a honda, I'm chasin the Comma's
Pull up in the Phantom!
Young nigga had to get it
From the bottom, ?
You'll never find a nigga that can do it like me
On the jet gettin' paid flyin cross the country
Fuck all ?
Your bitch wife me on tv
Walk in ?
Diamonds dancing on the camera
Ask your baby momma, I'm the hottest in Atlanta

Red bottom my shoe, like I murdered a bitch
VVS diamonds, my neck, and my wrist
Got 5 gold ring's on
Nigga mad cause his girl got my song on her ringtone
Pull up in Phantom, I'm ridin with Loucy
See she got a trophy
I know that you cussin' and lovin' that bitch
You watchin' her clothes leave

Young nigga gotta trap
Pull up in the Phantom with the Forgiato rims
Two ho's, and they kissin' in the back
She poppin' the molly, she know that I'm rich
She flippin' & doin' them trick's
Walk in my mansion, and bitches are doin the dishes
You see how I live
These dollars I'm a mu-fuckin rich nigga
Give a fuck about a bitch nigga, rich nigga
