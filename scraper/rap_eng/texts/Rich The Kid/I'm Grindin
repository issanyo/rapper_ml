[Hook: TK-N-Ca$H]
I’m grindin’
Hustle all day, money piling
I’m wyling
I’m grindin’
Went and copped that foreign, now I’m riding
You lying
But I’m grindin’
Hustle all day
I’m grindin’
Hustle all day
I’m grindin’

[Verse 1: T-Wayne]
Ok I’m paper chasing, I’ma get it any time
Ain’t gotta show respect but make sure you respect the grind
I’m just tryna see them better days
No wooly mammoth but that chain look like the ice age
Ok it used to be a hoopty, now I’m riding foreign
Going around and I’m flexing on a groupie
I ain’t never been an actor but I swear to god that I’ll make a movie
She used to hate on me in school but now she say she wanna do me
That’s crazy

[Verse 2: Rich The Kid]
I been grindin’
Pockets stuffed with cheese, lasagna
Check my diamonds
Rolex bezel flooded, shining
You was steady tryna hate
I was running up the cake
Goin’ crazy in the coupe
Bitch looking for the roof
Hustle, got to get it
I put mama in that Bent, no more Honda Civic
Chasing paper, can’t sleep
Big bag full of cash
[?] Steve Nash
Jugg the plug with a mask

[Hook: TK-N-Ca$H]
I’m grindin’
Hustle all day, money piling
I’m wyling
I’m grindin’
Went and copped that foreign, now I’m riding
You lying
But I’m grindin’
Hustle all day
I’m grindin’
Hustle all day
I’m grindin’

[Verse 3: TK-N-Ca$H]
Cause I’m grindin’
Diamonds shining
You been lookin’ for the money, bet I find it
And you lying
You ain’t never drive a foreign, now you spying
Cause you see me ridin’ in it
I been grinding so long, I’m just tryna get this paper
Getting cash over everything, fuck a hater
We ain’t asking for no hand outs or no favors
Middle finger if you doubted, screaming see you later

[Verse 4: Tate Kobang]
Wake up in the morning and I thank the lord
I ain’t to got to trap no more
We ain’t on the corner no more
Pills ain’t on me no more
It was days, all I see was darkness
Used to be in the park, [?]
Now it’s always push to start shit
And the shooters with me case they wanna start shit

[Hook: TK-N-Ca$H]
I’m grindin’
Hustle all day, money piling
I’m wyling
I’m grindin’
Went and copped that foreign, now I’m riding
You lying
But I’m grindin’
Hustle all day
I’m grindin’
Hustle all day
I’m grindin’
