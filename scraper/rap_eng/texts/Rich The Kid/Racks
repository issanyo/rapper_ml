[Intro]
Uh what?
Aye, aye, aye, relax
Wait, relax
Yaa, yaa, yaa, yaa, yaa, yaa

[Hook]
I just hit a big lick
I threw her out the doorway
I fucked that lil bitch dog
I told that bitch go away
You can not smoke with me
I'm [?] and I don't [?]
I brought all my dogs with me
My niggas they all paid
Racks sitting on top of them racks
Racks sitting on top of them racks, racks, racks
Racks sitting on top of them racks
Racks sitting on top of them racks, racks, racks
Racks sitting on top of them racks
Racks sitting on top of them racks, racks, racks
Racks sitting on top of them racks
Racks sitting on top of them racks, racks, racks

[Verse 1: J $tash]
Pour 4 up in a Fanta
I'm rockin' Gucci sandals
I fucked her on the camera
Met that bitch down in Atlanta
I'm sellin' Danny Phantom
I ride in a brand new Phantom
I'm on them pills, she say, "It's kinda hard to understand him"
Seen the Rolex, now her boyfriend, she said she can't stand him
You know i'm gon' flex everyday, can't take that shit for granted
I pull up in that coupe
I drive by they be like,"Oooh"
Stupid fruity swag, diamonds wetter than a swimming pool

[Hook]
I just hit a big lick
I threw her out the doorway
I fucked that lil bitch dog
I told that bitch go away
You can not smoke with me
I'm [?] and I don't [?]
I brought all my dogs with me
My niggas they all paid
Racks stacked on top of them racks, racks stacked on top of them racks, racks, racks
Racks stacked on top of them racks, racks stacked on top of them racks, racks, racks
Racks stacked on top of them racks, racks stacked on top of them racks, racks, racks
Racks stacked on top of them racks, racks stacked on top of them racks, racks, racks

[Verse 2: Rich The Kid]
Money counter, keep the hunnids around me
Blue cheese got my pockets sloppy
Broke rapper, ain't got no shows
Drop a hunnid four times in a row
Relax
My trap nigga bring the pounds of the gas
Richwater take a dive splash
Can't buy her a purse, but i fuck her, she bad
Rich Forever blue cash
Trap money, put a mil in the stash
2 phones, plug callin' me back
Cut her off, I was chasing a sack
Relax
Count a half a milli, I'ma flex in your face
Mo' racks, drop a bag in the safe
M&M's, Goyard on my waist.

[Hook]
I just hit a big lick
I threw her out the doorway
I fucked that lil bitch dog
I told that bitch go away
You can not smoke with me
I'm [?] and I don't [?]
I brought all my dogs with me
My niggas they all paid
Racks sitting on top of them racks
Racks sitting on top of them racks, racks, racks
Racks sitting on top of them racks
Racks sitting on top of them racks, racks, racks
Racks sitting on top of them racks
Racks sitting on top of them racks, racks, racks
Racks sitting on top of them racks
Racks sitting on top of them racks, racks, racks
