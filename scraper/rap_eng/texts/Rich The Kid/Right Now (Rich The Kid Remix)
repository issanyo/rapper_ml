[Intro: Rich The Kid]
Know what I'm sayin', Rich Forever shit
Flexed up, right now

[Hook: Evander Griiim]
Right now
C'mon baby, bust it open, right now
Throw the cash, all I want it, right now
All the pussy, all the fame, right now
All the love, all the fame, right now

[Verse 1: Evander Griiim]
Niggas try to ride my wave but can't swim
Nigga you be chewing too, too much
Got a foreign in my foreign, and she snorin'
Little nigga I'm the GOAT, 'bout to trip it
Eski-eski-eskimo, I'm so cold
Ride around with my neck, and my wrist
On froze, nigga gold, all gold
All gold, all the hoes, all the drip
Poppin' pussy, nigga woah, with my gold
Nigga tax me I'ma flip, with my thumb
Poppin' pussy with my thumb, with my thumb, right
Right now
Throw it baby, bust it open, right now
All I wanted was a ten and a four
All I get it for the low, for the low
Hit that nigga, I'm the plug, right now
Send that nigga with the bugs, right now
All my bitches kiss bitches, and they wealthy
And they suckin' for the selfie
I'm so petty, oh so petty

[Verse 2: Rich The Kid]
I got the check on me right now
I take her, I'm fucking her lights out
I was in the field like a quarterback
Bitch better ride like a horseback
Gold, wrist froze
Niggas know that I was trappin', I had elbows
I was meeting with the plug, Pablo
Had to hit me for the work, peso
I got to trap off the beeper
You a bitch, you got the desert eagle
Now I'm trapping 50 for a beach
I'm painting pictures, Mona Lisa
Rich Forever and we over right now
Diamonds they bite like a tiger
Lambo, I bought me a spider
Bitch I'm on fire like a lighter
Flexed up, right now
Niggas hate, I got the check, I won't pipe down

[Hook: Evander Griiim]
Right now
C'mon baby, bust it open, right now
Throw the cash, all I want it, right now
All the pussy, all the fame, right now
All the love, all the fame, right now
C'mon baby, bust it open, right now
Throw the cash, all I want it, right now
All the pussy, all the fame, right now
Right now
