[Verse 1: Soulja Boy]
Whipping and whipping
I’m breaking my wrist, I’m fucking your bitch
Taking a trip, to flip all these bricks
And get all these bricks, I’m rich
Me and Rich the Kid riding around and hitting these licks
I’m rich, but I’m still hitting licks
Still hitting licks, I'm still hitting licks
Still hitting licks, I’m still hitting licks, AP on my wrist
Flex with your bitch, I’m fucking your bitch and we taking a trip
Soulja, Soulja, Young Soulja, Young Soulja
Young Soulja and Rich The Kid
Soulja, Rich The Kid
Feels good to be rich
Hollow tips, extended clip leave a body in ditch
Versace, Versace, Givenchy, Givenchy, they all on my dick
AP on my wrist, I know I’m the shit
Cuban links, they cost 30 G's, study this shit
Keep me a hollow tip if a nigga talk shit
All of my niggas that’s on the block trap, trap, trap
Get rich, trap trap, get rich
Taking a trip and I’m flipping the bricks
Pistol on my lap full of hollow tips
Bad bitch, I’m making her strip
Whippin'  the foreign whip, 'round South Vegas
I'm riding the strip
Niggas talk shit and get hit with the K
Fuck out my way
King Soulja, lil Dre
Pull up on your block and you know I’m spraying
Niggas get shot up if they think I’m playing
SODMG, we plug with Jamaicans
Turn up, turn up, turn up, all we smoke is loud
Pull up to the club and I shoot up the crowd
I’m turning up, I’m not turning down

[Verse 2: Rich The Kid]
I’m breaking my wrist, the police they busting my spot
I’m jumping the fence
The bitches they hated, they said I wouldn’t make it
Young nigga I’m finally rich
I sip the Actavis, you do the Qualitest
Pull up with Soulja, these bitches gon' bother me
More pints than a pharmacy
Covered in gold, you cuffing these hoes
Was broke but I’m touring the globe
Young rich nigga, whole lot of cash on me
This chain on my neck worth four Rolexs
The Audemar look like a waterfall
The trap is jumping, no basketball
You taking that bitch to the mall
Rich nigga got bricks in the wall
I done came from the bottom
Now it’s QC the Label and I’m sitting at the top nigga
You a lame ass nigga, still cuffing these hoes
My bitch got a bitch with her
Put me in the kitchen, I can show you how to do it
Forgi’s on the Rari, pull up with the Uzi
My necklace is flooded, Jacuzzi
Living my life is a movie
