[Intro: Roy Woods]
Woah woah, oh...
Woah woah, oh...

[Verse 1: Roy Woods]
Ride around with a few tings I don't know them
Pass that blunt let me show you how to roll it
Still in the six spend time by my lonely
I don't need bands to get panties on the floor
Just left my mom in LA fully loaded
All the females and the money is a bonus
Gotta' stay focused god knows where you goin'
Never lost sight on the mission that I'm on
Are you down or just sayin' that you are?
Spent a lot now I'm making deposits
Can't stop this music my heroin, yeah
Now is it all good if you get down on me?
Spend a few rounds on me
Where you gon' go?
Let me set that brand new thing, girl when you back it off for me yeah

[Chorus: Roy Woods]
I want you to ride in my new new
My new shawty attitude new new
Hit the club and I spend it on you you you
None of these girls got what you do
I want you to ride in my new new
My new shawty attitude new new
Hit the club and I spend it on you you you
None of these girls got what you do

[Interlude]

[Verse 2: Rich The Kid]
Uh, yeah
New bitch hop in the coupe bih (What?)
I brought a hoe like a toupee
Fuck her two time make that pussy go cray
She give me top in the Maybach Mercedes
Ooh
I might just make her my boo
No flex I'm addicted to you
I pull up she look for the roof
I just might buy her a rolly
Smoking a cookie she rollin'
Ice on my pinky she can get a ring
Shawty too bent now she want to sip lean
I let her ride it (ride it)
Bought me the 'rari I gave her the Mazzi
The toppy too sloppy
Fuck her one time now she callin' me papi

[Chorus: Roy Woods]
I want you to ride in my new new
My new shawty attitude new new
Hit the club and I spend it on you you you
None of these girls got what you do
I want you to ride in my new new
My new shawty attitude new new
Hit the club and I spend it on you you you
None of these girls got what you do
