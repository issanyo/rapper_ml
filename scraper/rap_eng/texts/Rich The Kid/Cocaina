[Chorus: Daniels]
She like the night life 'cause she know everybody
She like my big house, she throw my afterparties
She really like me, but she, she love that cocaina
Cocaina
She like tequila, she drink it from the bottle
She's such a nice girl, I think I won the lotto
She really like me, but she, she love that cocaina
Cocaina
It's a great day to hit the slopes

[Verse 1: Daniels]
All my cutlery is platinum and it's good for cutting cake
But my flatware is Versace, don't be fuckin' up my plates
Girl, I told you, tell your people there's some rules they shouldn't break
But fuck it, it's a Sunday, keep the party going late
Pablo, so bring the next ones in, but it's way too many
Let the best ones in, wait
She got a three-piece with her, only let one in
Tell the other two there's no space
I got one for you, one for you and you and you and you
So fuck you, she's cool, but not the dude
She want in Miami at the beach house
She like it when we poolside with her feet out
She want it in the bathroom at the night spot
You can catch her in the back room, check the blind spot

[Chorus: Daniels]
She like the night life 'cause she know everybody
She like my big house, she throw my afterparties
She really like me, but she, she love that cocaina
Cocaina
She like tequila, she drink it from the bottle
She's such a nice girl, I think I won the lotto
She really like me, but she, she love that cocaina

[Verse 2: Rich the Kid]
Walk around town with a bankroll
Bitch fell in love with the coco
Bought a ap, coulda got a condo
Kick a bitch right out the Lambo
White diamonds on me like cocaina
Finessin' a pearl for his mamacita
Nigga tryna ride a wave, I don't do no feature
Direction, my pocket, might pull out a beeper
Jet blow, straight through the hundos
Always broke i walk around with a bankroll
Is it summertime, pull up in the two door
She'll hop on the dick like a pogo
Trappin' all white like a napkin, call me the captain
Broke ass but I'm still cappin'
I bought a yacht in Miami
She wanted a Beemer, you bought her a Camry

[Chorus: Daniels]
She like the night life 'cause she know everybody
She like my big house, she throw my afterparties
She really like me, but she, she love that cocaina
Scarface, cocaina
Cocaina, she love that cocaina

[Outro: Daniels]
Tato, tranquilo
Mami, ay dios mio
Me llamo, el jefe
Tata, mi amor
