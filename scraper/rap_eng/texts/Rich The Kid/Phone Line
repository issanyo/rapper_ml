Phone line
All these dam bitches on my phone line
I just called Rich on the phone line
Tell em we need a brick on the drug line
Thats my phone line (phone line)
All these dam bitches hit my phone line (bitches)
Callin' up Rich on the phone line
Say we need 50 chicks on the drug line

[Verse 1: Rich the Kid]
AP, Cost me, 50
I got chicken, Bitches whippin' the dope
Stickin' the dick in they throat
Pull up in ghost
Right when it come off the boat
Trap house is boomin' and bunkin'
Young nigga I'm stackin' the paper
Sippin on Laker
Passin your bitch hot potato
I live in a mansion I don't got no neighbors
Bitches be stalkin' the plug
He stuffin'  the plane
He fly the bricks to New Orleans
Feels good be rich
Young nigga I come from the bricks
Flexin' finesse with tricks
Back then I was broke
Momma said Rich we cannot get no cable
Im countin the M&M s blessed with the Benjamins QC the label
