[Intro: Rich The Kid & M R$CH]

Get up!
We ready to get up, you'll stay down
Whoa, Aye
Dollasignnow
Getting rich
I can't wait
I can't wait
Me either

[Verse 1: M R$CH]

Fly shit, only on my [?], I'm rocking [?]
High up in the hills and my view is really lavish
She running from the dick cuz she say I'm doing damage
She couldn't keep this shit to herself, it's hard to manage
Dollasignnow, we up, how did it happen?
Niggas stay real, no movie scripts, no acting
But nigga

[Hook: Rich The Kid] (x2)

Do you got a problem?
I got a chopper or revolver
Stay down in the trap
Got an Uzi and a Mac
Hunnid' rounds in your back
Niggas killing for a sack

[Verse 2: M R$CH]

Stay down in the trap
You don't even know that I rapped
Need my paper asap
And I keep me a [?]
Trapping how I wanna in these Cali streets
I'm from Minnesota, I'm just trynna eat
Everybody know cuz I rap it
Keep that M on my [?]
Ain't gonna be no disrespecting nigga
Everywhere I go, bro, I'm showing love
They know: "That nigga don't bang, but he know what's up"
Anywhere I go, man, I'm good
Real nigga straight, showing [?] hood (x2)
And I'm living out my dreams
Trapping out in Hollywood
Hold it, this nigga to my left he keeps looking
What's good?

[Hook: Rich The Kid] (x2)

Do you got a problem?
I got a chopper or revolver
Stay down in the trap
Got an Uzi and a Mac
Hunnid' rounds in your back
Niggas killing for a sack

[Verse 3: M R$CH]

Niggas hating on me cuz I'm pulling up
With a foreign, with the top back
And they know what's up
They know it's us - we dem niggas
You shooting but your eyes closed
You ain't no killer
Look me right into my eyes
You see who realest
Boy, I'm pulling up from deep, I'm Reggie Miller
I'm going hard in the [?], I'm the [?]
And my flow been killing shit, call it [?]
