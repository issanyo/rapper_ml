[Verse 1]
Getting money is a hobby
Drugging your bitch up she run around a lot
She sucking me in red Balenciaga
I fucked her then passed out that never a problem
I can do magic call me Harry Potter
You niggas is little ya’ll play cops and robbers
Can’t stand these fake niggas they some imposters
You is Luke Skywalker, I am your father
Money hanging out my pocket man can you not see
All my nigga camouflaged in army fatigue
Gold plated sharper Range I am the nigga that people wanna be
Kanye West ego, it’s all about me
Wanna live like me, gonna cost a fee
My diamonds so colder than the winter breeze
People that didn’t like me now wanna hang
Ain’t riding with that fake shit, nigga please
Put that shit over there get away from me
That girl over here sucking and she on me
All yellow Lamborghini like a bumblebee
I’m over here shaking my dread like I’m Bugatti
Don’t give a fuck what you think that shit don’t phase me
I just run up a check to let you niggas know that I get it
I run up on you to see if you with it
I’m a bad boy just call me P Diddy
I know you wanna be like me just admit it
Red dot on you and you cannot escape it
You not getting money so why try to fake it
One call that’s all, you know they gonna take it
Tie him up and send him down to the basement

[Hook]
Rolls ghost and the clip hanging out the door
Looking at that crowd you that know we pack every show
I look at these niggas that’s joke then stomp on mine with my gold Margiela toe
Smoke your party like a bag would a pole
You cannot get everything you not angelical hoe
Call me if you want you know that I’m blasting
Riding the ‘85, riding the Aston
Yeah I’m from the north nigga who asking
Have someone take you out like an assassin
Got your girl right on the tele I just got to hit it
I skeet on her belly it look like a reincarnated Machiavelli
Fuck that lil nigga I’m never gon tell him
Shipping these bullets I got a melli
You pussy nigga I know that you smelly
The hand that you put it on you not gon sell it
I’m just living life and all these folks jealous
I know that you smarter than that I can sense it
When I’m in trouble I get Lingo senses
Riding round the city my windows tinted
What’s in my pocket that’s none a your business nigga

[Verse 2]
Fuck the law, fuck the law
Freeze the homie got a bitch wanna lick it off
Too much money young nigga can’t spend it off
Lingo with me in the Bentley we taking off
All a my diamonds don’t drip
In the coup getting top and a rim
Young nigga bought a chain with the grip
And I’m straight from the jet to the check bitch
Round one quarter mil on my next shit
Niggas hating beat instead a texting
Aaliyah I fucked in a Lexus
I was broke a man milli I did it
Man go wake up and go get it
Fame bout money ain’t speaking
Young nigga had to fight for no reason
I be getting to the money ain’t sleeping

[Hook]
Rolls ghost and the clip hanging out the door
Looking at that crowd you that know we pack every show
I look at these niggas that’s joke then stomp on mine with my gold Margiela toe
Smoke your party like a bag would a pole
You cannot get everything you not angelical hoe
Call me if you want you know that I’m blasting
Riding the ‘85, riding the Aston
Yeah I’m from the north nigga who asking
Have someone take you out like an assassin
Got your girl right on the tele I just got to hit it
I skeet on her belly it look like a reincarnated Machiavelli
Fuck that lil nigga I’m never gon tell him
Shipping these bullets I got a melli
You pussy nigga I know that you smelly
The hand that you put it on you not gon sell it
I’m just living life and all these folks jealous
I know that you smarter than that I can sense it
When I’m in trouble I get Lingo senses
Riding round the city my windows tinted
What’s in my pocket that’s none a your business nigga
