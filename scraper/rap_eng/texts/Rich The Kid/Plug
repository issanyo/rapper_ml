[Chorus: Rich The Kid]
Plug, I was juggin', finessin', and flexin', till I ran into the plug
I got the key wrapped up in the Louis V now they call me the plug
I'm out in Guatemala with a quarter million dollars fuckin' with the plug
Touchdown on a nigga for his sack then I brought it to the plug

[Verse 1: Rich The Kid]
Finessin', I'm juggin' the plug, in the trap makin' play like a quarterback
Told them dumb nigga I'm takin' your sack, I came up from 1 gram
Now I pull up the blue lamb, hide 'em bricks and Trans-Am
The kitchen done turn into Michael like Jackson, I'm takin' the pint and I'm beatin' it
I'm mixin' the chemical, turn to a chemist and people done call me a genius
I was thirteen, ran up on the plug, stickin' 'em up for the drugs
Pull off in the Wraith and I'm pourin' the pints of the mud
Flipping the pot like white water, I flip but they callin' me Flippa
They callin' my Motorola for zippers
I'm out in Jamaica with strippers
Hunnid band, hunnid band, jugg
Me and Rel Money hit a lick on the plug, mo money, Imma blow it
Motorola, still whippin' yola, young nigga, they call me the plug

[Chorus: Rich The Kid]
Plug, I was juggin', finessin', and flexin', till I ran into the plug
I got the key wrapped up in the Louis V now they call me the plug
I'm out in Guatemala with a quarter million dollars fuckin' with the plug
Touchdown on a nigga for a set then I brought it to the plug

[Verse 2: Playboi Carti]
Bitch, you know I bag it, Raf Simons bag
Perry Ellis bag, call my phone, I bag it
Bought my hoe some Palace, she know that I bag it
Ayy, yo, Jero had a bail, he know that I bag it
I'm gon' move that traffic, can't let these opps have it
It’s snowing in my attic, it’s snowing in my yard
My block too hot for all that shit so you don't want no action
Niggas get to blasting, man down, somebody braggin'
Designer jeans, I cash and let a nigga have it
Probably at Follies or we up at Magic
Ayy, bitch, I let em have it
She know that I bag it up, he mad cause she bag it up

[Chorus: Rich The Kid]
Plug, I was juggin', finessin', and flexin', till I ran into the plug
I got the key wrapped up in the Louis V now they call me the plug
I'm out in Guatemala with a quarter million dollars fuckin' with the plug
Touchdown on a nigga for a set then I brought it to the plug

[Verse 3: Kodak Black]
I'm ballin' on you niggas don't nobody fuck wit you cause you a scrub
Thirty inches on that G body, nigga I don't ride dub, really, im the plug
Kodak, why you do me like that? I just want a lil love, no bitch I'm a thug
Nigga already know what's up, so don't try to dap me up, when you see me in the club
She say baby, you ain't gotta rush, but i already caught my nut
What you expect? I'm booted up
I told her leave her shoes at the door
Better not catch you steppin' on my rug or Imma wet you up

[Chorus: Rich The Kid]
Plug, I was juggin', finessin', and flexin', till I ran into the plug
I got the key wrapped up in the Louis V now they call me the plug
I'm out in Guatemala with a quarter million dollars fuckin' with the plug
Touchdown on a nigga for a set then I brought it to the plug
