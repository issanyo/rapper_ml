"You owe me"

(Hook) (Rich The Kid)
Fuck her, flip her, pass it ain't no texting

Look Ouu, pinky ring raindrop
I make your man go dat way, I make your girl come this way x2

(Verse 1) (Rich The Kid)

Bad Bitch stalking me , 10 in the morning
Raindrop , pinky ring
Iced my watch put my wrist on 3-D

(Verse 2) (Rich The Kid)
