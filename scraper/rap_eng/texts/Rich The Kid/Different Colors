[Hook: Rich The Kid]
These hoes tricking made a fucker wear a rubber
Sipping actavis cup of muddy trouble
Run them bands up I can make it double
Still flexing got my diamonds different colors
Different colors, Different colors
Chains, Rings, Colors
Different colors, Different colors
Watch, Different colors

[Verse: Rich The Kid]
Chains, Watch, Different Colors
I been fucking with your baby mother
Lambo or the Wraith, Two different colors
Look at my diamonds they dancing, Canary
Muddy trouble cup of codeine scary
Watch, brand new chain
I'm in Hollywood, don't need no brain
White, I've been fucking with the same color
I done made it off of baking soda
No iPhone I'm still trapping off this Motorola
Work, Whole lot
Two different color bitches in the same spot

[Hook]
These hoes tricking made a fucker wear a rubber

[Verse 2: Rich The Kid]
Purple I don't sip no other colors
I know these bitches wishy washy, I can't fucking trust them
Pinky Ring weigh a brick but this the same color
Bitches stripping in the kitchen why the fuck you cuffing
All my niggas 100 I can't change on them
She want a nigga with some chains on them
Freaks, pass them to my brother
Got a situation he gone switch and fuck them
All her shoes same color she want red bottoms
Bitch, you got a fucking problem
And I'm still counting more commas
All my bitches different colors give a fuck about them

[Hook]

Sipping actavis cup of muddy trouble
Run them bands up I can make it double
Still flexing got my diamonds different colors
Different colors, Different colors
