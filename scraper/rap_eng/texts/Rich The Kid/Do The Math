[Intro: Rich The Kid]
Huh
The diamond way
You know what I’m sayin’
You know them diamonds ain't real boy
She with the shit though

[Hook: Rich The Kid]
I know she with the shit
I got a diamond wrist
White Madonna bricks
And I might blind your bitch
I look at your diamonds and laugh
I need a Rihanna motherfucker, she bad
I just be doin’ the math
I put that shit on the dash
I know she with the shit
I got a diamond wrist
White Madonna bricks
And I might blind your bitch
I look at your diamonds and laugh
I need a Rihanna motherfucker, she bad
I just be doin’ the math
I put that shit on the dash

[Verse 1: Jay Critch]
New designer shit
Diamonds on me might blind a bitch
Now you can’t find your bitch
Sucking me up, I might sign a bitch
I need water on the wrist, that’s super cold
Shit look like the glacier
I poured water on my bitch, I hit it twice
Fuck around and erase her
Niggas sitting on the bench
Rich Forever ball out like the Pacers
Got a new bitch then replace her
Lot of purple, nigga play for the Lakers
You a lame Urkel boy, go get your cake up
Bad bitch, I’ma fuck up her makeup
Bad bitch, she just came from Jamaica
For that cash cliques, have you meeting your maker
Hey, new designer shit
Red bottoms when I step on the gas
Fetty monster got these bitches mad
Fuck Instagram, getting instant cash
Hey, hood fav had to hop in my bag
Was on the block, had to hop in the lab
Rode the bus, had to hop in the Jag

[Hook: Rich The Kid]
I know she with the shit
I got a diamond wrist
White Madonna bricks
And I might blind your bitch
I look at your diamonds and laugh
I need a Rihanna motherfucker, she bad
I just be doin’ the math
I put that shit on the dash
I know she with the shit
I got a diamond wrist
White Madonna bricks
And I might blind your bitch
I look at your diamonds and laugh
I need a Rihanna motherfucker, she bad
I just be doin’ the math
I put that shit on the dash

[Verse 2: Rich The Kid]
I’m in the back
More cash, fuck a price tag
Give me top in the coupe
Two foreigns, gotta lift up the roof
Fuck what they think
They was sleeping, I was all in the bank
I might make her faint
Still leanin' on the pints of the drank
She with the shit, I fuck her sister
Suck on my dick but you kissed her
Boy you a shrimp
Bought the Masi, dropped the top like a temp
Diamond wrist now, I might take your bitch now
Hollywood, I hold my wrist out the whip now
Gotta bolt, this a Ghost
My bitch say I do the most
Keep the money extra close
They only hating ‘cause they broke
I might take her to the trap again
My diamonds they straight from the Africans
She look like Rihanna, she with the shit
I’m flexing around with the baddest bitch

[Hook: Rich The Kid]
I know she with the shit
I got a diamond wrist
White Madonna bricks
And I might blind your bitch
I look at your diamonds and laugh
I need a Rihanna motherfucker, she bad
I just be doin’ the math
I put that shit on the dash
I know she with the shit
I got a diamond wrist
White Madonna bricks
And I might blind your bitch
I look at your diamonds and laugh
I need a Rihanna motherfucker, she bad
I just be doin’ the math
I put that shit on the dash
