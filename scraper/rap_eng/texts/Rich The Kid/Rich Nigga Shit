[Hook]
This that rich nigga shit
Got a AP on my wrist
This that rich nigga shit
I just cashed out on a Bent'
Rich nigga shit, rich nigga shit
Rich nigga shit, this that rich nigga shit
Rich nigga shit, rich nigga shit
Rich nigga shit, this that rich nigga shit

[Verse 1]
Rich nigga got money like Oprah
Hundred-fifty bands cashed in the sofa
Trap phone juggin' off a Motorolla
Got money on the table like a coaster
Two cups in the morning, I'm leanin'
In a Maserati just left Neiman's
Got a red bad bitch suck semen
Feels good to be rich, I'm dreamin'
20 bands for a show, QC chain froze
Got your bitch on go
Porsche white like snow
Made a mil off blow
And I'm still gettin' mo'
Can't trust no bitch
My wrist game sick
Got 4, 5 whips
Young nigga takin' trips
Muhfucka I'm rich

[Hook]
This that rich nigga shit
Got a AP on my wrist
This that rich nigga shit
I just cashed out on a Bent'
Rich nigga shit, rich nigga shit
Rich nigga shit, this that rich nigga shit
Rich nigga shit, rich nigga shit
Rich nigga shit, this that rich nigga shit

[Verse 2]
QC the label, money on table, plugged in like cable
Pull up in a Aston Martin coupe with the Forgiato rims, I ain't tellin' no fable
I got so much money, blow my nose in twenties
Trap house jumpin' like Bugs Bunny
Got commas on commas, count up in designer
Took your bitch to Benihana's
Back then I had a Honda, bought a Bentley for my mama
Bitch I'm hotter than the summer, feed down for an Audemar
Could've bought a new car but my diamonds go retard
No key, just push start
Rich ass nigga got a portrait by Mozart

[Hook]
This that rich nigga shit
Got a AP on my wrist
This that rich nigga shit
I just cashed out on a Bent'
Rich nigga shit, rich nigga shit
Rich nigga shit, this that rich nigga shit
Rich nigga shit, rich nigga shit
Rich nigga shit, this that rich nigga shit
