[Intro: YBN Almighty Jay & Rich The Kid]
Oh, gang, gang, gang (ayy, It's Rich Forever, gang, gang, gang)
Whatchu-whatchu, gang, gang, ayy (gang, gang)

[Chorus: YBN Almighty Jay & Rich The Kid]
I got a chopstick, a FN, and the Draco hold 100 (Draco hold a 100, grrah)
Got a shooter in the booth with me like he goin' huntin' (like he goin' huntin')
She like, "Who them YBN niggas? Why they always stuntin'?" (why they always stuntin'?)
Where yo' bag at? Where yo' cash at? Boy, you frontin' (uh, uh)
Smokin' cookie blunts out the cookie jar, and we don't match that (gang, gang)
Don't leave me yo' mixtape 'cause I'm gon' trash that (bitch)
Bad yellow bitch, she bag it up, I tell her, "Bag back"
I love my chopstick, that bitch be shootin' like it's Baghdad (wow, grrah)

[Verse 1: Rich The Kid]
And my bitch got a chopstick like she Chinese (bitch)

Young nigga, I trap out a Sidekick (trap)
Don't play with my niggas, they violent (violent)
I flew with my choppas, I'm private (whoa)
Got a chopstick, a FN, and the Draco hold a 100 (a 100)
Got a shooter in the coupe with me, I got all this money (skrrt)

Lemon bitch, and she talk back when she bareback (hol' up, hol' up, Rich)

[Chorus: YBN Almighty Jay]
I got a chopstick, a FN, and the Draco hold a 100 (Draco hold a 100)
Got a shooter in the booth with me like he goin' huntin' (like he goin' huntin')
She like, "Who them YBN nigga's, why they always stuntin'?" (why they always stuntin'?)
Where yo' bag at? Where yo' cash at? Boy, you frontin'
Smokin' cookie blunts out the cookie jar, and we don't match that (remix, gang)
Don't leave me yo' mixtape 'cause I'm gon' trash that (remix, gang, pow)
Bad yellow bitch, she bag it up, I tell her, "Bag back" (bag back, ayy, ayy, ayy)
I love my chopstick, that bitch be shootin' like it's Baghdad (grrah)

Niggas want me dead, but got no aim so what you shootin' at? (huh, ooh)
Y-YBN, Rich Forever
Cut off my ex-hoe to get it together (bitch, ooh)
She told you wait 'til y'all married, but she let me fuck
The first time I met her (gang, ooh)
