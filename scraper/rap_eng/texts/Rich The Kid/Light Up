[Intro: Rich The Kid]
You know how the fuck we bomin', nigga
Hottest young nigga in the street
Sayin' we burn shit up
(Good job, 1st!)
Huh, huh?

[Verse 1: Rich The Kid]
My bitches got bitches, we lit (We lit)
Trap, we whippin' a brick (Trap)
But then I was jumpin' the fence (A what?)
Diamonds on me, I'm a prince (Ice)
Fuck that, I'm a king (A king)
Ice up on the ring (Ring)
Bad bitches love the bling (What?)
Three hoes on a screen (Huh?)
Four hoes by the door (Door)
Five hoes, need some more (Bitch)
Ooh, I'ma serve it for the low
Ooh, I'm a fisher, I'm a pro (A pro)
I'm a cook, I'm a chef (Cook it)
I'ma shooter at your neck (Grrah)
I'm a baller for the check (Baller)
Tell her light up and gimme the neck (Rich!)

[Verse 2: Xander850]
On a roll
I just popped an Addy, in the zone
Rewind it and reload
I just took a shot with the bros
They said they got my back now
'Cause we do it for the bag now
Got the whole bag without the trap now
And lil' shawty rollin' up the graas now

[Chorus: Xander850]
Tell that chick to light up
I'm getting real higher, light up
Tell lil' shawty light up
I'm getting real higher, light up
'Bout to smoke for the first time in a long time
No, this not my last time
But this strand, it looks outstanding
I gotta feel that on my mind

[Verse 3: Xander850]
See us ridin' with a lot now
Whippin' 'round the city with the top down
And lil shawty out here wildin' out with her top down
Ooh, we got pulled over by the cops now
In a Jag so we goin' fast, 150 in an 85
Not a care in the world, no
We're just tryna live our fuckin' life

[Chorus: Xander850]
Tell that chick to light up
I'm getting real higher, light up
Tell lil' shawty light up
I'm getting real higher, light up
'Bout to smoke for the first time in a long time
No, this not my last time
But this strand, it looks outstanding
I gotta feel that on my mind

[Outro: Xander850]
Lotta cash and we're goin' fast
So you know I'm driving really high
Swerve the road, hope we don't crash
We're just tryna live our fuckin' life
(If you look into my eyes, you can tell I'm high
It's a vibe
If you look into my eyes, you can tell I'm high
It's a vibe
Light up....)
