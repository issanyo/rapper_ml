Everything designer, everything designer
Everything designer, everything designer
Swag from another country

Foreign shit from other countries
Everything designer, everything designer

[Verse 1: Rich The Kid]
OG gas from another country
Trap shit in the hood, young nigga getting plenty money
I could whip it so easy
I'm a young rich nigga trapping down like Jeezy
I'm smoking good gas from the west coast
Got a real thick bitch, get the best though
And still in the corner with the best dough
Why you wifing that hoe, she ain't in for
And my whip game foreign
Pull up in a Rari, trap jumping like Jordan
Picking shipment in the morning
Addicted to money, that's only important
Too much ice in the wrist
Compton bando, teach you how to whip a brick
In the trap with the sticks
I done made a million dollars but I'm still hitting licks
I done fuck and leave the stove on
Ice too cold, yo bitch might need a coat on
Trap in the trenches
Standing in the trap with a bundle of bricks
Your bitch wanna fuck with a real nigga
Smoking on backwood, no swisher
I'ma pull up in a Rari and a Phisker
In a mall walking around to take pictures

[Verse 2: Yank Deezy]
In a foreign whip with a foreign bitch, blowing foreign shit cause it taste better
Step out the Maison Margiela's
Then I step in the kitchen to make extras
On some different shit the way I whip the wrist
In the bando trap and me and Rich The Kid
I'm balling boy you can't bitch the kid
Montana Max, young rich you rich
And I stay with the shotgun like open season
Right through the chest to make a nigga pledge allegiance
Your bitch on my penis
European threats from England
I'm spending this cash for no reason
Just landed in Sweden
Ice got me cold as a penguin
Wearing that work like I'm [?]
Feeding the streets cause they need it
Nigga we eating, living this life while you dreaming
I know you see it
Nothing but pistols and real niggas on the side of us
Gotta stay fresh to death everyday cause a nigga like me be designer'd up
Bricks coming up across that water, you can say that's my designer plug
Smoking on moonrocks, sipping on Actavis, yeah them designer drugs

[Verse 3: Boosie Badazz]
Hermes for my mama, whole clique designer
Gucci for Tootie red bottoms for Iviana
Nigga neck kinda foreign tonight, uh your neck kind boring tonight
Got a bitch look like J Lo with me, everybody know I like em bright
I be riding tight
Double r, Rolls Royce, that's a raise nigga
Yeah they got a couple niggas got that
Designer rims hood nigga, I'm a nigga from the project
Designer coke was foreign but rap more important
She all on my swag, ooh boy them jeans look foreign
Running from different countries, foreign homes, I'm eating
(She say hi but that's 'bout it), cause she don't speak no English
Rolex, Tobago, no roof, how I roll
Everybody gotta go designer blood like that nigga Pablo
Boosie
