[Intro: Quavo]
Yeah

Migos in the building
Yo, what's up, Rich The Kid?

Shit, I might get that 'Rari
I said that's hard
Tell them hoes I'm sorry, man
Y'all pardon me
'Scuse me

[Chorus: Quavo]
Birds singin' just like Marvin (brr)
Y'all niggas out here starvin' (starvin')
My diamonds, they sparklin' (shine)
A rich nigga, pardon me (pardon me)
Sorry (sorry), might pull off in that 'Rari (skrr)
Pardon me, sorry, might pull out Aston Martin (skrr)
Birds singin' just like Marvin (money)
