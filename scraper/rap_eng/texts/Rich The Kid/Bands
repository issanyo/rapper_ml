[Hook - Mally Bandz]
Cause I'm the man
If I ain't text you bitch, i'm prolly chasing bands
We ain't shaking hands (nooo)
If I ain't text you bitch, i'm prolly chasing bands
If you want extra, I told her to bring a friend
She wanna sit, now she sleeping of a xan
This heat on me gon give you a tan
We don't do no flexing on the gram
She ain't ask no questions, just got in
All I did was text and hit again
What the fuck you in here for ain't tryna win
Diamonds look a waterfall and they blinding them
Get here looking lost, you misguide them
Every year  as soon I got in

[Verse 1 - Melo Guyzer]
On the gram talking greasy
I'm out on you like 3d
Designer dripping like Fiji
Lowkey, nigga wanna be me
Get that money, thats the basics
Whole lotta blue faces
Taking trips out to the Vegas
Fucking bitches, different races
This lean got me in the Matrix
Cookie [?], I
Going gorilla, going ape shit
Then I pull up in the big fit
Baby girl, she was fiending
So I ran up in Nemans
I spend what you niggas dreaming
She wanna glizzy, she a demon
I got in on me, I run it now
Fucking everybody like furniture
Boy, your in trouble with the Punisher
I saw [?] like coroner
I wanna run it up bands
Now you bro, I ain't no mans
My bro pop you like xan
He the homie, he cool like a fan

Diamonds look a waterfall and they blinding them
Get here looking lost, you misguide them
Every pack I get year  as soon I got in

[Verse 2 - Rich the Kid]
I told that bih please don't complain
Hoe, this a bentley, not a range
I'm tryna fuck, I'm kicking game
Oh that's your boyfriend, he a lame
Everything, straight flooded
Double cup, still money
One around hunnid
I was broke, came from nothing
She wanna hop in
I fucking her sister, her best friend
They accusing each other, they lesbian
The pussy licking when they [?] in
