[Hook: Rich The Kid]
Break a brick down, all 21
I’m a savage nigga, like 21
Had the chopper ‘fore I hit 21
And the clip hold all 21
21, 21, had the chopper ‘fore I hit 21
Got a clip and it hold 21
I’ma hit you with the whole 21

Break a brick down, all 21

21, 21, had the chopper ‘fore I hit 21
Got a clip and it hold 21

[Verse 1: Kalan.FrFr]
21, I’m finna cop a Masi
21, she got a lot of body
I ain’t 21 but trappin’ is a hobby
Empty 21, I bet I drop a body
21, but I ain’t savage bitch
Plus 9 on me, on some savage shit
Trash bag full of gas
Duffel bag full of cash
Never kiss her if she babysitting
She gon’ pay a nigga just to pay attention
Two bad bitches and they both kissing
Put they head down, now my dick missing
20 bottles, I ain’t even 21
20 bitches, beat the pussy like a drum
ATL your ho, I tell her give me some
But got to strap it up so she won’t give me none’
Bitch I’m for real
I bet your bitch know the deal
Bands on my neck, I’m so trill
Hit ‘em up, I tote the steel
Pistol in my pocket like a wallet
It’s designer, then I got to cop it
If it’s a lick, a nigga got to flock it
Running with the pack, a nigga never drop it
If she choosin’ I’ma run in your bitch
Catch you slippin’, I’ma run in your shit
Niggas trippin’, we got 21 clips
Shoot a movie, we got 21 flicks
Niggas trapping, we got 21 bricks
Maison Margiela, your bitch on my dick
FaceTiming with your bitch on my wrist
While the other hand whip the whole 36, for real

[Bridge: Rich The Kid & Kalan.FrFr]

[Verse 2: Kalan.FrFr]
Pull up on the block and empty out the clip, I serve the whole 21
You say you need a zip, well I’ma pack it up and FaceTime you when it’s done
21, that’s the feature price
21, that’s my sneaker price
Bands on my neck, look at the ice
Illuminati, had to sacrifice
Boy I’m so ignorant
Potato on the barrel and chopper be whispering
The feds be listening
Tried to catch me slippin’ when I shipped it to Michigan
Bitch I be gettin’ it
Bitch I be gettin’ it, bitch I be gettin’ it
Cause bitch I be shippin’ it
Bitch I be shippin’ it, bitch I be shippin’ it
