[Hook]
I put that bitch in red bottoms
Nigga was snitching, the feds got him
Pull up in Rari, that’s not a Charger
She want that Fendi and Ferragamo
Sipping on nothing but drink
Actavis straight out the pint
Doing the shit that they can’t
I got the bands in the bank
I got the bands in the bank

[Hook]
I put that bitch in red bottoms
Nigga was snitching, the feds got him
Pull up in Rari, that’s not a Charger
She want that Fendi and Ferragamo
Sipping on nothing but drink
Actavis straight out the pint
Doing the shit that they can’t
I got the bands in the bank
I got the bands in the bank

[Verse 1]
I got bitches in red bottoms, nigga was snitching, the feds got him
Louboutin comes with the spikes on, flexing on purpose, my ice on
Actavis, sipping on drink
Hitting that ho in the sink
Rich, I got bands in the bank
Pouring the purple, the pink
Putting that bitch in some red bottoms
Givenchy, Givenchy, I flex on em
Niggas that hate cause I got money
Trap got the goons and the blue hundreds
I been running with the real nigga bands
Capping and trapping and made it happen
Came from the bottom, they said I wouldn’t make it
I put the cash in they face
Old, money so old, but I want more
Neck full of gold, everything’s froze
I got a check, pull up with TECs
And the respect, look at my neck

[Hook]
I put that bitch in red bottoms
Nigga was snitching, the feds got him
Pull up in Rari, that’s not a Charger
She want that Fendi and Ferragamo
Sipping on nothing but drink
Actavis straight out the pint
Doing the shit that they can’t
I got the bands in the bank
I got the bands in the bank

[Hook]
I put that bitch in red bottoms
Nigga was snitching, the feds got him
Pull up in Rari, that’s not a Charger
She want that Fendi and Ferragamo
Sipping on nothing but drink
Actavis straight out the pint
Doing the shit that they can’t
I got the bands in the bank

[Verse 2]
Niggas be sipping on anything
I got the codeine, promethazine
Pourin' the Actavis on the plane
Kicked in the door and I found a chain
My bitch got racks in her purse
I’mma need 100 racks for a verse
I get them pints from my nurse
All of my niggas got work
Bitches they come by the twos
She want to look at my jewels
Money got me in the mood
Rari, it come with no roof
I ain’t seen you in the city
Flexing on purpose like Diddy
I got the hoes like I’m Pippen
Hurting their feelings, I’m winning
I been living like a rock star
Getting head from a bitch, suck the dick like a porn star
Whipping the brick like a retard
200 in cash on the dashboard
Whipping with red bottoms
Heard that you snitching, the head shot em
Knew you was through when the feds got you
Got back on the streets and they red dotted

[Hook]
I put that bitch in red bottoms
Nigga was snitching, the feds got him
Pull up in Rari, that’s not a Charger
She want that Fendi and Ferragamo
Sipping on nothing but drink
Actavis straight out the pint
Doing the shit that they can’t
I got the bands in the bank
I got the bands in the bank

[Hook]
I put that bitch in red bottoms

Doing the shit that they can’t
I got the bands in the bank
I got the bands in the bank
