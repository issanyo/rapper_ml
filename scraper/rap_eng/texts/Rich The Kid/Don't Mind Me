[Intro: Famous Dex + (Rich The Kid) + TK Kravitz]
I'm sayin' oh man God damn
(You nigga the fucker man forever shit
We take over the world lil bro, nah for real)
Nah for real, start flexin' right now, let's get it

[Hook: TK Kravitz]
Don't mind me I'm just stuntin' right now
Cause life got me high, I ain't never comin' down
Thumb through that check man I love that money sound
Thumb through that check man I love that money sound

[Verse 1: TK Kravitz]
I came through to stunt on purpose
I buy all my girls purses
Night and day for the money I'm lurkin'
I want that new Maybach, I close the curtains
Watch me go and get it
I'm the hottest in the city
Wanna be just like Diddy
I walk around town with 50 on me

[Hook: TK Kravitz]
Don't mind me I'm just stuntin' right now
Cause life got me high, I ain't never comin' down
Thumb through that check man I love that money sound
Thumb through that check man I love that money sound

[Verse 2: Rich The Kid]
Run up with a check like Nike on me
Roy diamonds real deal, icy on me
Rich Forever chain that's water 3D
Bandana on forehead we get it out the street
Niggas hate cause I'm winnin'
Bought a Mase', chopped the ceilin'
Fuck your bitch, sloppy, sloppy
I was choppin' that 20 Bugatti
Mama said put down that lean
Drinkin' I pour up this pink
Cookie dough, smokin' that stank
I'm shittin' on rappers, you stink

[Hook: TK Kravitz]
Don't mind me I'm just stuntin' right now
Cause life got me high, I ain't never comin' down
Thumb through that check man I love that money sound
Thumb through that check man I love that money sound

[Verse 3: Zoey Dollaz]
Money machine, oh-oh-oh-oh
I'm countin' green, oh-oh-oh-oh
Don't mind I'm just countin' right now
Got bout a 100,000 all twenties right now
These niggas mad, look at my haters, they said
They say a young nigga too fly cause I be poppin' them tags
I told 'em...

[Hook: TK Kravitz]
Don't mind me I'm just stuntin' right now
Cause life got me high, I ain't never comin' down
Thumb through that check man I love that money sound
Thumb through that check man I love that money sound
