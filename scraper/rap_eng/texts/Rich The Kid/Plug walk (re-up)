Rich The Kid & JP Fuego Plug walk re-up
.

Rich The Kid
[Chorus]
Ayy, ayy, plug walk (plug walk, plug, plug)
I don't even understand how the fuck my plug talk (huh? what, what?)
Pick him up in a space coupe, I don't let my plug walk (skrrt, pull up in a space coupe)
New freak, had to cut my other lil' bitch off (ooh, ooh, lil' bitch)
50K, you could come and book a nigga for a plug walk
.
JP Fuego [Verse 1]
I've never owned a truck or whip (what?)
Although I drive your bitch crazy like a chauffeur (skrrt,skrrt)
I'll let her chill on my lab like sofa (go shawdy)
Odb thoughts but I'm YG (youngin , youngin)
I hope y'all nigga naa mean (naa mean)
Mc to the highest degree (levels, levels)
I'm too hot like the flame burns inside of me (what, what?)
I might walk on water like peter (splash, splash)
Nigga full of miracles
Plug walk, plug talk, no pillow talk
Flakka flakka I'm too high , need me a spaceship (fly, fly)
Super Nintendo, Sega Genesis (super NES)

.
[Chorus]
Ayy, ayy, plug walk (plug walk, plug, plug)
I don't even understand how the fuck my plug talk (huh? what, what?)
Pick him up in a space coupe, I don't let my plug walk (skrrt, pull up in a space coupe)
New freak, had to cut my other lil' bitch off (ooh, ooh, lil' bitch)
50K, you could come and book a nigga for a plug walk
.
JP Fuego [Verse 2]
I woke up in the middle of the night and wrote a song (ghostwriter)
You niggas is Kevin Hart on the hook , y'all just ride along (jokes on you)
Ain't no fake shit nigga ,you can even check my catalogue(tell em B)
Vans,Timbers,23's and Redbat (tell em B)
I'll let you talk to the hand, that's a monologue
Hit me up online, nigga I don't even say shit (what)
Been on steroids since twenty sixteen
(long ago, long ago)
Nine three double o, city of hot teens (vixens, vixens)
They know me as Dj Take a nigga's bitch
Done came from the street of the East
Where they yell gang ,gang,gang,gang
A whole lotta gang shit
They talk it like they walk it
Plug walk , moon walk , I'm Michael Jackson (plug walk , plug walk)

[Chorus]
Ayy, ayy, plug walk (plug walk, plug, plug)
I don't even understand how the fuck my plug talk (huh? what, what?)
Pick him up in a space coupe, I don't let my plug walk (skrrt, pull up in a space coupe)
New freak, had to cut my other lil' bitch off (ooh, ooh, lil' bitch)
50K, you could come and book a nigga for a plug walk
