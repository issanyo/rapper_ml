[Intro: Jay Critch]
Pierre, you wanna come out here?
What's all the talk about?
What's all the talk about?
What's all the talk about?

[Chorus: Jay Critch]
What's all the talk about?
I hear they chat, they ain't talkin' no brag
I gotta walk it out
Hundred racks, can't fit in the bag
Check the McFlurry
That's a lot of ice, walkin' around with a slab
Vision get blurry, ayy
Diamonds moving like the shits got lag
I need M's in the safe, no lie
President like I talk to the dad
Play it safe, boy you come in last
Residents got me finding your head
Out the roof, we ain't following no rules
Niggas feeling froggy, we the type to change a nigga's mood, ayy

[Verse 1: Jay Critch]
I came up on one and made it two, ayy
That bitch tryna link, bitch it's too late
Lotta lead up in my cup, used to be Kool-Aid
Hologram all on these busters like the Bluray
How your man be switching up over some loose change?
Goin' in like Liu Keng, 'til a nigga too paid
We got Henny and the D'usse
She a freaky lil bitch, she bad
Suck me up and my boxers rip
Diamonds hittin', yeah boxin' bitch

[Chorus: Jay Critch]
What's all the talk about?
I hear they chat, they ain't talkin' no brag
I gotta walk it out
Hundred racks, can't fit in the bag
Check the McFlurry
That's a lot of ice, walkin' around with a slab
Vision get blurry, ayy
Diamonds moving like the shits got lag
I need M's in the safe, no lie
President like I talk to the dad
Play it safe, boy you come in last
Residents got me finding your head
Out the roof, we ain't following no rules
Niggas feeling froggy, we the type to change a nigga's mood, ayy

[Verse 2: Rich The Kid]
I do numbers, Bentley truck no Hummer
Shitting on these niggas, call the plumber
Ain't nothing to talk about
Wrist on bust down, hold it out
I bought a pint just to pour it out
Fuck her one time and I kick her out
She say I'm rude
Boyfriend call, I'm killing the mood
Go to the moon
Run up on me, get hit with a boom
Gucci on my glasses
I don't want no Bally
Bitch I'm in New York
I'm smoking Cali, I got salad

[Chorus: Jay Critch]
What's all the talk about?
I hear they chat, they ain't talkin' no brag
I gotta walk it out
Hundred racks, can't fit in the bag
Check the McFlurry
That's a lot of ice, walkin' around with a slab
Vision get blurry, ayy
Diamonds moving like the shits got lag
I need M's in the safe, no lie
President like I talk to the dad
Play it safe, boy you come in last
Residents got me finding your head
Out the roof, we ain't following no rules
Niggas feeling froggy, we the type to change a nigga's mood, ayy
