[Intro: Famous Dex]
You know what I'm sayin'
What we doin' Rich?
You know what I'm sayin'
The elevation way
The money way
You know what I'm sayin'
Rich Forever Way
Ooh, Dexter

[Hook: Famous Dex]
Huh huh, what, bitch I be lucky like three
Ooh, yeah, bitch I be lucky like three
Diamonds they drip like the sink
Bankroll in my jeans
Pullin' the Lam out, it's clean
Bitch I be lucky like three
Huh huh, what, bitch I be lucky like three
Ooh, yeah, bitch I be lucky like three
Diamonds they drip like the sink
Bankroll in my jeans
Pullin' the Lam out, it's clean
Bitch I be lucky like three


[Verse 1: Rich The Kid]
Woah, you might get lucky like three
My shooters they shooting for me
Not one chain wearing three
Yellow diamonds, my wrist is on pee
Sloppy toppy, give me top in the Rari
Three rings but I'm balling hardly
Bitch I might Gucci your socks
Three bitches give me top
Three trappers, one block
The kitchen, I'm cooking the drop
I still got that dope in my sock
Rich Forever, we still on top
Three hundred get you popped
One phone call get you knocked
Three bullets in the Glock
Gucci slippers on my sock

[Hook: Famous Dex]
Huh huh, what, bitch I be lucky like three
Ooh, yeah, bitch I be lucky like three
Diamonds they drip like the sink
Bankroll in my jeans
Pullin' the Lam out, it's clean
Bitch I be lucky like three
Huh huh, what, bitch I be lucky like three
Ooh, yeah, bitch I be lucky like three
Diamonds they drip like the sink
Bankroll in my jeans
Pullin' the Lam out, it's clean
Bitch I be lucky like three

[Verse 2: Famous Dex]
Bitch I be lucky like three
Bad bitch magazine
I got this Bape on my jeans
Sippin' that Wock, someone pass me the weed
Lil boy you ain't in the streets
I fuck your bitch, pull her weave
Wait, my watch is on freeze
Alicia bitch, I play the keys
Wait, Goyard my bag
Walk in the mall, I don't brag
I don't check a tag
Run up on him, he a fag
Put that lil boy in a bag
Rich Forever be with me
I got these diamonds my teeth
Wait, your bitch be a freak
Bitch I be lucky like three
Dexter!

[Hook: Famous Dex]
Huh huh, what, bitch I be lucky like three
Ooh, yeah, bitch I be lucky like three
Diamonds they drip like the sink

Pullin' the Lam out, it's clean
Bitch I be lucky like three
Huh huh, what, bitch I be lucky like three
Ooh, yeah, bitch I be lucky like three
Diamonds they drip like the sink
Bankroll in my jeans
Pullin' the Lam out, it's clean
Bitch I be lucky like three
