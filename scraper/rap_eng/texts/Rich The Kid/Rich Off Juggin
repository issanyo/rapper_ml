[Intro: Eskay]
Mook!

Rich off juggin'!
Rich off juggin'!
Rich off juggin'!

Rich off juggin'!

[Verse 1: Eskay]
Back in high school I never got in AP
Now I be gettin' money because nothin' ain't free
Everyone who doubted me they fuckin' hate me
I be seeing all the places that them niggas can't see
I got a check, and now I ride on a jet
No baby we can't have sex, you ain't Moschino your dress
Niggas they hatin' because I turn up my shows
And they be bringing out niggas and I be bringing out hoes
Watch me jump in the crowd, I got rich off beats
I got rich off kicks, my niggas got rich off the streets
'Til I reach 10 mill this shit ain't mission complete
Bitch you living off tips when I'm in the VIP nigga—

[Hook: Eskay]
I done got rich
I done got rich
I done got rich
I done got rich
I done got—
Rich off juggin'!
Rich off juggin'!
Rich off juggin'!
Rich off juggin'!
Rich off juggin'!
Rich off juggin'!
Rich off juggin'!
Rich off—
I done got rich!

[Verse 2: Rich The Kid]
Rich off juggin'
I'm still cookin'
Auntie whippin'
Got them pigeons
Shippin' them birds like ándale!
Rarri you juug out a Escalade
Ya'll niggas still broke
You talkin' 'bout work but you ain't seen the dope
You ain't neva pulled a kick door
100 band juug brought it back to the bando
I be too hot like a candle, flippin' the work like a sandal
What you know about juggin'?
All my niggas got guns, we ain't doin' no hookin'
Bring your bitch around me she gon' get tooken
We ain't doin' no flexin', pull up you know that I'm flexin'
Whippin' the pot for the extra, 100 bands cash on my necklace
Mad that I'm rich, your bitch she pull up with bricks at 6
Rich nigga still hittin' them licks!

[Hook: Eskay]
I done got rich
I done got rich
I done got rich
I done got rich
I done got—
Rich off juggin'!
Rich off juggin'!
Rich off juggin'!
Rich off juggin'!
Rich off juggin'!
Rich off juggin'!
Rich off juggin'!
Rich off—
I done got rich!
