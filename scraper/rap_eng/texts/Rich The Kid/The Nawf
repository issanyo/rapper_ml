[Hook]
Real boss take a loss
Sniper rifle take you out
We was jugging in the nawf
Buy it all fuck the cost
For real I'm finnesin' the plug
Purple paint in a mug
Bad bitches showin' love
On the nawf came up
I had to jugger the nawf
I made a plug in the nawf
That's the bando in the nawf
Got a sniper rifle, take you out
I'm runnin' up in the nawf
I made a mil' in the nawf
Real boss take a loss
Came up in the nawf

[Verse 1]
Bando that's a trap
Bad bitches bring it back
Bring a perc, bring a bag
All the dope jugger set
I was finnesin' you know it
The best and I flooded a rollie
Sniper rifle on a roof
Four holes on a booth
Meet the plug in the nawf
Real boss take a loss
Now I got it, I'm flawless
Maybachs, no roof
I was jugging, finessing
I done got rich, that's the blessing
I done ran it up, no question
My shooters got toppin' Smith & Wesson

[Hook]
Real boss take a loss
Sniper rifle take you out
We was jugging in the nawf
Buy it all fuck the cost
For real I'm finnesin' the plug
Purple paint in a mug
Bad bitches showin' love
On the nawf came up
I had to jugger the nawf
I made a plug in the nawf
That's the bando in the nawf
Got a sniper rifle, take you out
I'm runnin' up in the nawf
I made a mil' in the nawf
Real boss take a loss
Came up in the nawf

[Verse 2]
I'm flexing on purpose, you know it
Water diamonds like a lake
Fuck the slave, take the cake
I was grinding, I was straight
I stand in my house and they doubting me
My momma she told me I had to leave
My wrist is on zero degrees
I'm getting the rest in Belize
Hollywood, change locations
In the field with my haze
Real boss take a loss
Being rich forever, no Ross
Like Birdman I been stuntin'
I cop a wraith, it ain't nothin'
On the top, press a button
Call my phone for a onion
