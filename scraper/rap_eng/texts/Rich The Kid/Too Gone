[Intro: Khalid]
No, oh, mm-mm-mm-mm, yea

[Chorus: Khalid & Rich The Kid]
Ooh, I'm sorry if I missed your call
Lately I'm just trippin' off this alcohol
I'm not really used to you calling me back
But I'm way too gone and I'm out of it (way too gone)
And I'm way too gone and I'm out of it (way too gone)
And I'm way too gone and I'm out of it (way too gone)
I'm not really used to you calling me back
But I'm way too gone and I'm out of it (hold up, what)

[Verse 1: Rich The Kid]
Way too gone, too many shots of Patr√≥n (what)
She wanna ride in a Maybach home (skrrt)
Passed out, I can't pick up the phone (brrt)
I don't call back, I got Tourettes (what)
She want Chanel and all that (huh)
Might fuck her one time and I fall back (huh)
She think I'm in love, what you call that? (yuh, yuh)
Thinkin' too much, I been sippin' (sippin')
Said that she thought I was different (what)
I want that money, go get it (go get it, go get it, yuh)
Ain't buyin' her Prada (huh)
She bad as hell but she can't get a dollar (yuh)
Might call you tomorrow ('morrow)
With three freaks and they all tryna swallow (woo)
Flexin' up, no departure (flex)
Got a bitch gon' ride for me (bitch)
But might fuck yo' bitch on a Snapchat (Snapchat)
Pass her around, she a nat nat (whoa)
Really not used to you callin' me (callin' me)
I'm in love with the coupe (coupe)
She too bougie, get the boot (bougie)
Too gone on the juice (rich)

[Chorus: Khalid & Rich The Kid]
Ooh, I'm sorry if I missed your call
Lately I'm just trippin' off this alcohol
I'm not really used to you calling me back
But I'm way too gone and I'm out of it (way too gone)
And I'm way too gone and I'm out of it (way too gone)
And I'm way too gone and I'm out of it (way too gone)
I'm not really used to you calling me back
But I'm way too gone and I'm out of it (huh, huh)

[Verse 2: Rich The Kid]
Takin' a bottle, I'm outta here (what)
She blow up my phone, I don't care (brrt)
Ask if I'm high, I'm like, "Hell yeah" (hell yeah)
Pull up to my crib with no underwear (skrrt)
Hold up, bitch, I'm a star (bitch)
Foreign swerve, don't push it to start (swerve)
Shawty, you smart (smart, ooh)
Ooh, she a model but she can't get the part (whoa)
Couple tequilas (tequilas)
Fuck yo' mamacita ('cita, 'cita)
Right when I meet her (meet her, meet her)
Chanel on my feet (yuh)
Maybach with curtains ('tains)
She tryna hop in (in)
Bitches, I'm blockin' (yuh)
They keep on callin' (whoa)
She wanna fuck on my wrist (wrist, ice)
It's lit (it's lit)
Bitches, they takin' they pics (pics, pics)
I'm rich (rih')
I slur when I slip a little
I got two bitches and I'm in the middle (whoa)
Came up from a nickel (nickel)
That's your girl, got her on a rental (bitch)

[Chorus: Khalid]
Ooh, I'm sorry if I missed your call
Lately I'm just trippin' off this alcohol
I'm not really used to you calling me back
But I'm way too gone and I'm out of it (way too gone)
And I'm way too gone and I'm out of it (way too gone)
And I'm way too gone and I'm out of it (way too gone)
I'm not really used to you calling me back
But I'm way too gone and I'm out of it
