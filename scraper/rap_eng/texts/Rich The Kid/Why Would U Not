[Hook] Part 1	(Johnny Cinco)
Young nigga stay on the grind
The racks on the way though
The racks on the way though
The way though
Young nigga serve on the grind
And I want the peso
I want all of the peso
All the peso
Why would you not go up in it
Why would you not go in shine
Why would not go in Rover
I paid a forty for mine
Why would you not go up in it
Why would you not go in shine
Why would not go in Rover
I paid a forty for mine

[Verse 1 : Rich the Kid]
I paid a forty, these diamonds just in my bezel they shining might make you go blind
Had to stay down rackin them up in peso's
The fuck come in. my chain say QC the label

Young nigga on fire, ain’t got no fever
Real trap niggas still got my people
Rich nigga problems, which car I’m gon' drive (Skrr,Skrr,Skrr)
Might pull up in the act that’s escuse me pourin’,sorry!
Took down on the board, we were picking the packages
Juggin’ the plug for the cannabis
Young nigga, I finally made it, got plenty of benjamins
Young nigga stayed on the grind, Now I want them M’s
Why would you not, stay off the block when it’s hot. I got the work at the spot
I takin’ a trip, your bitch wanna fuck me because I got the peso.(Oooo Wee)
I’m wake up she whippin’ the Lambo, I got the ammo, no Rambo

I just Cavalli’d my couch. Lot of bad bitch on the couch
She don’t clean up while I count. She don’t clean up while I count
I’m a fuck her when I finish, woke up to breakfast and Bennish
Why would not go a Bentley
Why would you not go commercial
Why would you not go a PJ

Fuck all the ho’s and they momma, Fuck all the ho’s and they momma

Pappi got me playin’ Poppyseed. Why would you not give the bitch the Rollie
Bezel full of yellow bumblebee’s, California Rari overseas. (wooo!)
Rich the Kid, OG Gas Bags, Juggin’ Mid. Purchasing price of the reg
Sippin’ and spilling on my Louboutin heels. I get em in, lil’ trap on the hill
Why not get them bitches digits foreal. I live my life Beverly, like Dr. Phil
Diamonds on my neck, they give you a chill
Blue Benjamin’s I want them bills
Paper-cuts, I got em thumbing no deal
Young nigga still grindin’ in the bando
Hit em with the chopper let it go
Now another nigga dead, got it knocked off .44
Y’all niggas stay on this grind
All I ever wanted was some more
