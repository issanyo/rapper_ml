[INTRO]
If I ain't got no haters I ain't popping
If I ain't got no haters I ain't popping nigga

[VERSE]
If I ain't got no haters I ain't popping
Fuck the Feds cause they know they watching (fuck 12!)
I got too much money in my pocket (I got racks!)
Ballmains and my pocket's sloppy
In red Rari with a red bitch
Diamonds dancing, my new wrist
Got locked up on some trap shit
Fucked around and came back bitch
Feds hating cause I got them commas
Too much money bitch I got a problem
New whip when I pull up, Rich nigga with them chains on
Last week I was locked up, had to walk around with them chains on
Ye-ain't gangsta, ye-ain't never seen a chopper
As a kid, momma' said I was a monster
Bad bitch, she-a cook fish, still playing around with that white
Fuck around with them freak hoes, they eat molly like rice
AK, they gon' spray it at your face nigga
I got little niggas, beat the case nigga
Came home to a dumb check, fuck 12 free Offset
Ten 10s on my neck, bet it get your bitch wet
Niggas think they all that, I'm back now, better fall back
Ran it up, I got tall racks
Bitch I'm back in that same trap!
Fuck around [I still got that] that blacka-blacka
I still want the cheese like a fuckin' whopper
I just got my syrup from that fuckin' doctor
And I just might pull up in a helicopter
Riding around in the A-town, Money long like Greyhound
You still ride on that bus, got Actavis in my cup
Givenchy looking like it came up out the jungle
You playing with my money then your ass in trouble
Purposely I'm flexing, all this ice in my necklace
Got lotta' hoes like a pimp, you walk around like a shrimp
Your bitch on my dick because she know I'm poppin'
Ima' fuck her, nothing you can do about it
Free Murda, Free Mango, bat whipping that Lambo
Niggas really mad cause' they know I'm poppin'
Pull up on the scene I got my pocket sloppy
Ima' set the trend and then these niggas copy
If I ain't got no haters I ain't popping
Fuck the Feds cause I know they watching (fuck 12!)
I got too much money in my pocket (I got racks!)
Ballmains and my pocket's sloppy
If I ain't got no haters I ain't popping
If I ain't got no haters I ain't popping (I ain't popping nigga)
If I ain't got no haters I ain't popping nigga
Fuck the Feds cause they know they watching (fuck 12!)
