[Chorus: Hoodrich Pablo Juan & Rich The Kid]
Mixed the cookie with the OG veteran
I'm mixing up my medicine
Popped me a Percocet, Lortab, and the Xanny
I need my medicine
Fell in love with that dirty Fanta
Activis, Hitech and Tussionex
Mixed my medicine like DJ Champ
Geeked out, fell asleep on the jet
Busting the bricks out the wrapper
We the original dabbers
Chopper bullet that'll hit you
Pussy good, I'ma split you
Actavis, I don't drink Qualitest
I'll pick up your bitch in a private jet
Popped me a Perc and a Vicodin
Still leaning, I'm mixing the medicine

[Verse 1: Hoodrich Pablo Juan]
Mixing that Hitech with the Tussionex
Cookie bag, call me fat ass
Don't be coming at me with no Qualitest
I need Act, my apologies
I'm in your hoe like a gynecologist
I got the carats and the collards
I got a snow bunny, Miley Cyrus
I popped a Percocet just to balance
I got OG like the gangstas in Cali
I drank too much lean, got me fat like I'm Khaled
Platinum cookies like a Wendy's salad
At least an eighth of Hitech on the travel
Me and Spiffy got the Act, we in Dallas
Smoking Backwoods fatter than mallets
Ten pints, ten bands in the palace
Cookie blunt, I ain't passing, I'm childish

[Chorus: Hoodrich Pablo Juan & Rich The Kid]
Mixed the cookie with the OG veteran
I'm mixing up my medicine
Popped me a Percocet, Lortab, and the Xanny
I need my medicine
Fell in love with that dirty Fanta
Activis, Hitech and Tussinex
Mixed my medicine like DJ Champ
Geeked out, fell asleep on the jet
Busting the bricks out the wrapper
We the original dabbers
Chopper bullet that'll hit you
Pussy good, I'ma split you
Actavis, I don't drink Qualitest
I'll pick up your bitch in a private jet
Popped me a Perc and a Vicodin
Still leaning, I'm mixing the medicine

[Verse 2: Hoodrich Pablo Juan]
I just hit a lick for a brick
Buy a pint, nigga, pour a six
When them Percs in, I need a whole script
Drank too much lean, R.I.P. the Pimp
Moonrock and cookies, I'm mixing it
Popped me a Xan, got me ignorant
I need my drugs, that my medicine
I down the Vicodin with Tussionex
The stripper get loose on them Percocets
I don't want no red 'less it's Hitech
Get on a plane higher than the plane get
Jump out, Louie luggage, Damier
Can't see that I hopped through these Cartier's
I'm buying all my drugs by the pairs
I'm leaning too hard, need a wheelchair
On the road, trip [?]

[Chorus: Hoodrich Pablo Juan & Rich The Kid]
Mixed the cookie with the OG veteran
I'm mixing up my medicine
Popped me a Percocet, Lortab, and the Xanny
I need my medicine
Fell in love with that dirty Fanta
Activis, Hitech and Tussinex
Mixed my medicine like DJ Champ
Geeked out, fell asleep on the jet
Busting the bricks out the wrapper
We the original dabbers
Chopper bullet that'll hit you
Pussy good, I'ma split you
Actavis, I don't drink Qualitest
I'll pick up your bitch in a private jet
Popped me a Perc and a Vicodin
Still leaning, I'm mixing the medicine
