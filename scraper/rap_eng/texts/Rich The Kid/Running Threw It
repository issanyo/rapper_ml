[Hook]
Walking with that rollie cost a fifty
Bitches want to fuck me, I got millys
Then I made, know they hate it said I wouldn't do it
I trap that pack I got that sack and now I'm running threw it
Walking with that rollie cost a fifty
Bitches want to fuck me I got millys
Then I made, know they hate it said I wouldn't do it
I trap that pack I got that sack and now I'm running threw it

[Verse 1]
She said that she fuck with the new me
I fuck that bitch in my coupe
You stupid you kissing that groupie
Pouring the four, with a doobie
I was riding through the six
I got a trunk full of bricks
I got a robber no Chris
Flexing hard take a pic
Fucking your bitch and I smash
Look at my rollie, like cash
I'm walking around with a bag
My foreign ain't got paper tags
Got a pool like I'm Drake
Got a mansion on a lake
Rich nigga, eatin steak
Chasin' money always late
Look at the time on the watch
I fuck it you eating the box
I could go [?] before a drop
Fuck it, I'm losing the top
Fuck it, I'm doing the dab on 'em
Hollywood on a 100
Iâ€™m a juug servin' dummy
I'm a fiend for that money

[Hook]
Walking with that rollie cost a fifty
Bitches want to fuck me, I got millys
Then I made, know they hate it said I wouldn't do it
I trap that pack I got that sack and now I'm running threw it
Walking with that rollie cost a fifty
Bitches want to fuck me I got millys
Then I made, know they hate it said I would do it
I trap that pack I got that sack and now I'm running threw it

[Verse 2]
You just be talking the trap
I hit a bitch like a bat
Fuck it you eating the cat
Rich forever on the map
I put them rings on my fingers
Birds sing like singer
I got them fly like John Cena
I used to trap out the beeper
Fucking that bitch from the back
She give me top like a hat
Sticking my dick in yo cat
My Bloods, they bagging like blaat
I might off with your sack
I'm taken they know me for that
Walking with too many racks
Old money like a cadillac
I did a show in Bermuda
She riding the dick like a scooter
Pop a molly I'm a Buddha
Money trouble, scary, Freddy Kreuger
I be running through the money
Always prayers like Easter Sunday
I was broke, jug the hunnid
Money bought me what I wanted

[Hook]
Walking with that rollie cost a fifty
Bitches want to fuck me, I got millys
Then I made, know they hate it said I wouldn't do it
I trap that pack I got that sack and now I'm running threw it
Walking with that rollie cost a fifty
Bitches want to fuck me I got millys
Then I made, know they hate it said I would do it
I trap that pack I got that sack and now I'm running threw it
