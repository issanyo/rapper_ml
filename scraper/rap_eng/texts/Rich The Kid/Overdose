[Chorus: Rich The Kid]
I been rollin', I been drinkin', I been leanin', I been smokin'
I been rollin', I been drinkin', I been leanin', I been smokin'
I'm feelin' overdosed, I'm feelin' overdosed
I'm finna overdose, I think I'm finna overdose
I been rollin', I been drinkin', I been leanin', I been smokin'
I been rollin', I been drinkin', I been leanin', I been smokin'
I'm feelin' overdosed, I'm feelin' overdosed
I'm finna overdose, I think I'm finna overdose

[Verse 1: Rich The Kid]
Okay, I'm on the lean again, rollin' on the bean again
I think I'm finna overdose, can't wait 'til I can see again
Blowin' on that purple shit, sippin' on that purple shit
I'm leanin' like a bitch, I'm finna fall, I'm on that Actavis
Hold up, fuck it, the bottle's in the bucket
Got bitches in the bitch with me, you know they tryna suck it
Crush up two Xans, and I'mma put 'em in the syrup
Get a little kush, and I'mma mix it with the purp
I do this every night, so please don't try this shit at home
I'm drivin' to the crib, and your bitch blowin' up my phone
I'm swervin' like a bitch, I'm ridin' down 285
I think I'm finna overdose, I'm tryna stay alive

[Chorus: Rich The Kid]
I been rollin', I been drinkin', I been leanin', I been smokin'
I been rollin', I been drinkin', I been leanin', I been smokin'
I'm feelin' overdosed, I'm feelin' overdosed
I'm finna overdose, I think I'm finna overdose
I been rollin', I been drinkin', I been leanin', I been smokin'
I been rollin', I been drinkin', I been leanin', I been smokin'
I'm feelin' overdosed, I'm feelin' overdosed
I'm finna overdose, I think I'm finna overdose

[Verse 2: Bambino Gold]
Right now I'm feelin' jolly, just ate a gram of molly
Lick it off my palm, they started goin' [?]
I love to bottle pop, feed her coke, and mess her up
Poppin' Ros√©, it flowin' out the top
Dope got me sweatin', free [?]
Ice all on me, I think I'm Wayne [?]
Free my brother [?]
Yo, Blood gang
White and red diamonds, suuwoo and cocaine
Kush smell like pine, smoke that out the pound
I'm finna overdose, tonight it might be goin' down
I know you see this paper, I can't see you haters
I'm blowin' kush circles out the skyscraper

[Chorus: Rich The Kid]
I been rollin', I been drinkin', I been leanin', I been smokin'
I been rollin', I been drinkin', I been leanin', I been smokin'
I'm feelin' overdosed, I'm feelin' overdosed
I'm finna overdose, I think I'm finna overdose
I been rollin', I been drinkin', I been leanin', I been smokin'
I been rollin', I been drinkin', I been leanin', I been smokin'
I'm feelin' overdosed, I'm feelin' overdosed
I'm finna overdose, I think I'm finna overdose

[Verse 3: T-Mack]
I don't do no bean, we on that lean
Pour up out the pink, and I can't even think
Won't even blink, I had too much of that drink
Two hoes ain't enough for me, so
I need five or six
Still blowin' mid, I done graduated [?]
I just hit a lick, but I still bitch
Yeah, it was a whole brick, but I want twenty bricks
DTE the mall, we go extra hard, trappin' raw
Keisha out the jaw, stupid strong, bring a [?]
Keep throwin' ones in your set, you should be throwin' fifties
12 pull up on the block, I post out and dip it
Glock .40 thing on me, and it clip extended
I hold to your head thing, you could get the business

[Chorus: Rich The Kid]
I been rollin', I been drinkin', I been leanin', I been smokin'
I been rollin', I been drinkin', I been leanin', I been smokin'
I'm feelin' overdosed, I'm feelin' overdosed
I'm finna overdose, I think I'm finna overdose
I been rollin', I been drinkin', I been leanin', I been smokin'
I been rollin', I been drinkin', I been leanin', I been smokin'
I'm feelin' overdosed, I'm feelin' overdosed
I'm finna overdose, I think I'm finna overdose
