[Intro: Chevy Woods]
I got your bitch on my cellular
I'm counting up this is algebra
Bitch started tripping to hell with her
Real trees no medical
Keep it a buck with my guys
Just came from cooking a pie
Standing all over the stove
Suicide doors on the Rolls

[Chorus: Rich The Kid]
More money than Bank of America
Look at my diamonds unbearable
Bitches they fuck on the couch now, I put the dick in her mouth
Drink out the bottle we faded
Hollywood momma I made it
More money than Bank of America
Look at my diamonds unbearable
Bitches they fuck on the couch now, I put the dick in her mouth
More money than Bank of America
Look at my diamonds unbearable
Drink out the bottle we faded
Hollywood momma I made it

[Verse 1: Rich The Kid]
Swerving that Ghost up in Hollywood
Fuck her she sucking me good
You said I wouldn't make it I knew that I would
Pull up in a Wraith in the hood
Flipping your bitch like a skateboard
No roof in that thing just a dashboard
Mansion we don't got no neighbors
Bangin' I trap with the Taylor's
Look at your diamonds they fu-fu
Why are you smoking that boo boo?
I got a sniper gon' shoot you
I'm a big dog call me Blues Clues
Look at my diamonds unbearable
Fuck around you might go blind
50 a rollie I'm shining
I got your bitch on a [?]
I'm swerving no license or ID
I was broke got a milli
Put the money in the ceiling
Bend it over lemme feel it
Money like Bank of America
Too many rings are unbearable
I got a mil on the schedule
[?] all my clothes I got several

[Chorus: Rich The Kid]
More money than Bank of America
Look at my diamonds unbearable
Bitches they fuck on the couch now, I put the dick in her mouth
Drink out the bottle we faded
Hollywood momma I made it
More money than Bank of America
Look at my diamonds unbearable
Bitches they fuck on the couch now, I put the dick in her mouth
More money than Bank of America
Look at my diamonds unbearable
Drink out the bottle we faded
Hollywood momma I made it

[Verse 2: Chevy Woods]
I got your bitch on my cellular
I'm counting up this is algebra
Bitch started tripping to hell with her
Real trees no medical
Keep it a buck with my guys
Just came from cooking a pie
Standing all over the stove
Suicide doors on the Rolls
Tell 'em I'm balling like Vince
And my phone jumping like Vince
Out in Toronto like Vince
38 special hold 6
Never been friends with the plug
We exchange money and drugs
I double back in a day
He started showing me love
You mad 'cause I'm getting rich
Hollywood Hills me and Rich
She topped me after the club
I ain't know that was your bitch
Creep through the city with tints
'Cause I might be with your main
She liking all of my pics
She wanna fuck for the fame

[Chorus: Rich The Kid]
More money than Bank of America
Look at my diamonds unbearable
Bitches they fuck on the couch now, I put the dick in her mouth
Drink out the bottle we faded
Hollywood momma I made it
More money than Bank of America
Look at my diamonds unbearable
Bitches they fuck on the couch now, I put the dick in her mouth
More money than Bank of America
Look at my diamonds unbearable
Drink out the bottle we faded
Hollywood momma I made it
