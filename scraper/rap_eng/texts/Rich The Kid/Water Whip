[Hook - Rich the Kid][x2]

My diamonds got a flu they sick
Canary yellow on my wrist straight piss
Cook it up, stir it up, water whip
Then I poof, be gone with yo bitch

Water whip [x4]
In the kitchen all I do is water whip
Finesse the plug wit tricks

[Verse 1 - Rich the Kid]

Made a mil out the kitchen I ain't never had shit
You would think I was the shit the way I'm cookin up shit
Here (?) P and the Key (?) pulled up in the V
Diamonds sick on my neck like HIV

Re-whip, re-rock, remix
I'm serving the junkies tripped up in (?) like bunnies
You broker than fuck I got plenty of money
Finessin the plug, I hit em with dummies

Flying the bricks cross the country
I play with bananas like monkeys
Get killed in the Jungle, Jumanji
My diamonds is shiny it's sunny

[Hook][x2]

[Verse 2 - Rich the Kid]

Got bales in the rover whole lot a coco
Young Rich Nigga got bricks in the sofa
Flipping the world like a spatula
Got Audis and Rarris no challengers

The kitchen I'm cookin tilapia
The chopper the uzi I damage ya
My wrist getting crazy got stamina
Them pigeons they flying to Canada

Got 36 o's my wrist
I poof Houdini yo bitch
Got Audis got Rarris got whips
P90 long barrels got clips

[Hook][x2]
My diamonds got a flu they sick
Canary yellow on my wrist straight piss
Cook it up, stir it up, water whip
Then I poof, be gone with yo bitch

Water whip [x4]
In the kitchen all I do is water whip
Finesse the plug wit tricks
