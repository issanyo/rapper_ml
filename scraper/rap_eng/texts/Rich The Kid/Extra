Read all about it
I'm looking for that extra extra

[Verse 1: Rich the Kid]
Girl, you know you got that extra wet
When we done fucking for some hours, have some extra sex
Bitch, extra dick
I got extra whips
Ian' got no time for no extra bitch
Don't be mad cause I'm chasing my paper
I need my extra Benjamin's, I'm like fuck a hater
We should spend some time taking extra trips
[?]
Put some extra racks in her Bezel
I ain't mad
Bitch bad, extra bad
Put some extra racks in her extra bag
I can't even lie, she flexing
Red bottoms and she got extra
Ima' fuck her till I'm extra tired
Give her exercise

[Verse 2: Rich the Kid]
Know what I'm looking for
I need a bitch that need to dab on me, on some extra shit
Pull up with extra clips
Ain't dreaming about it, you living it
Everything foreign, extravagant
I'm in her mouth like cavity
[?]
And having no top with no speaker
Extra leaking
And I'm geeking
That's an extra reason
I'm on a pill with no advil
All in that pussy her ass real
Extra sauce
Even in that Coupe, she top me off
We in Hollywood, I ain't went Hollywood
Even [?] extra paid and I'm extra good
Ian' in a escalator, miss some extra shit
Bought my bitch a pinky ring, that cost a extra brick
