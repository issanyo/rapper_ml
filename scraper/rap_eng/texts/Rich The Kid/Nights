[Hook: Joey Fatts]
Young nigga went and got a check
Used to curve a nigga now they throw me sex
Thumbing figures while she give me neck
These the nights a nigga won't forget
She say that molly got her pussy wet
I tell that bitch she fuck me with her [?]
Thumbing figures while she give me neck
These the nights a nigga won't forget

[Verse 1: Joey Fatts]
Ten, twenty, fifty, man a nigga need to double up
Tonight I'm off the Henny, man a nigga need another cup
Shawty' fucking with me, guarantee she'll give my brothers some
These bitches out to get me because they see a nigga coming up
Young nigga had to get his check right
[?] we trapping that off white
Posted on the block like all night
[?] you gotta' walk like
Big Spanish, she can't talk right
She fucking on a nigga but that's on sight
We beefing with a nigga, then it's on sight
When we see that nigga, boy it's on sight
"Joey where you been?" I been cripping with my niggas ho
Thumbing through these M's, flying places we ain't been before
I spent a rack on these clothes
I spent the rest on my bros
I don't spend none on these hoes
Ima' G, gotta' stick to the code
Real fleek try to stick on my coat, boy this Margiela
On the East used to sleep in the cold, now my coat cost fifteen to [?]
All my niggas getting cheddar
All these bitches about whatever
Never been one for talking, but that 45.'ll give your ass a lecture

[Verse 2: Rich The Kid]
I got your bitch on the molly
A freak I just made her a [?]
Can't fuck her in the bed, got wet, wet
Hit it one time then I dipset
Look at my neck I got jewels
Lean, moving like a snail
Give me head, I won't tell
Can't fuck a bitch, got a smell
Nigga hating on me, I'm getting paid
[?] I'm riding in an Escalade
I got more ice than escapade
Came up off trapping in the seventh grade
In a world full of snakes
Bitches fucking, niggas fake
These friends will cut you for the cake
I left the struggles, living great
I want that neck like a scarf
Bought the foreign, got a push start
Pull up and I'm taking her heart
Kept it real from the start
Make a movie, flip the script
Got the nut upon her lip
Bought the jet, I took a trip
Made a milli', made it flip
I'm stepping on Ben Franklin in Balmain
Fuck a bitch, "What's your name?"
Swerving miles through the lanes
Rolly' fifty, plain chain
Roll up and I got a check
The foreign, it's making them wet
We got money on deck
Jug, flex and finesse
