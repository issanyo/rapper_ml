[Chorus: Jay Critch & Rich The Kid]
Just got back from London
You know how I'm bomin'
Balenciagas on me
Bank rolls coming

Aye cookie by the onion
Turn nothing into something
Aye Fendi, Masi, stunting
Lotta blue cheese coming

Blue cheese on the way though
I was fucking up a bank roll
Turn nothing into something
I was broke now I'm stunting

Twelve watching gotta lay low
Blow the racks like play doh
I was broke man I couldn't afford it
Nowadays I pull up in a foreign

[Verse 1: Jay Critch & Rich The Kid]
I'ma block her if she keep calling
Huh, Rich Forever, still balling
Maybach is [?]
BK that's Jay Critch
I was broke, got a broke wrist
Hundred bands now I ice it

Bentley truck just me and Rich
Hundred bands gotta make it flip
I'm the man and she notice it
I got money now she can't get over it

Huh niggas that hated, we balling
Pull up Bugatti, I'm sorry
I drop a dub on a ring
She want Chanel and CÃ©line

She want Chanel and a ring
But she cannot get a thing
Rich Forever bitch I ball like the ref
She in the back of the 'bach with Dex
Jugging up packs on packs, who next?
I need the racks on racks to flex
Call up my shooter he at your neck
I get the moolah, I fuck the rest

[Chorus: Jay Critch & Rich The Kid]
Just got back from London
You know how I'm bomin'
Balenciagas on me
Bank rolls coming

Aye cookie by the onion
Turn nothing into something
Aye Fendi, Masi, stunting
Lotta blue cheese coming

Blue cheese on the way though
I was fucking up a bank roll
Turn nothing into something
I was broke now I'm stunting

Twelve watching gotta lay low
Blow the racks like play doh
I was broke man I couldn't afford it
Nowadays I pull up in a foreign

[Verse 2: Jay Critch & Rich The kid]
Aye green cabbage gotta have it
Aye smoking jattic, living lavish
My bitch ain't average, rockstar Zoe Kravitz
She seen the fabric Goyard, let me smash it

I'ma smash it, attack it, pass it
I'm bending the bitch over backwards
Rolling with too many bankrolls, hundos
I ran them up for the blue notes

Walk around with the green on me, like Rondo
Too much money that it can't fold
Justo just got a elbow

Cash it, Rack it
Aye 50K on a back end

[Chorus: Jay Critch & Rich The Kid]
Just got back from London
You know how I'm bomin'
Balenciagas on me
Bank rolls coming

Aye cookie by the onion
Turn nothing into something
Aye Fendi, Masi, stunting
Lotta blue cheese coming

Blue cheese on the way though
I was fucking up a bank roll
Turn nothing into something
I was broke now I'm stunting

Twelve watching gotta lay low
Blow the racks like play doh
I was broke man I couldn't afford it
Nowadays I pull up in a foreign
