[Chorus]
Bands-bands-bands, that's a check talkin'
Take off your pants-pants-pants
Bitch, ain't no time for talkin'
Watch me do my dance-dance-dance-dance
Bands in my pocket
Come and get your mans-mans-mans
'Fore I up my rocket
Ooh, bands-bands-bands, that's a check talkin'
Take off your pants-pants-pants
Bitch, ain't no time for talkin'
Watch me do my dance-dance-dance-dance
Bands in my pocket
Come and get your mans-mans-mans
'Fore I up my rocket

[Verse]
Pull up with a choppa, let it eat, aye
Yah, walkin', Jesus sandals on my feet, aye
Ooh, talk with shiny gold all up on my teeth, yah
Ooh, and I'm rockin' Goyard and Supreme, aye
Yah, pull up with the choppa, watch 'em freeze, ooh
I got a shooter and he gon' take off his knees, aye
All it takes is two shots, watch his body drop
Bitches on my dick cause I skrrt off the lot, aye
Skechers on my feet but I'm a rich guy, yah
Cannot fuck with hoes 'cause they be picking sides
(just pick a nigga)
Ice-ice-ice, that's my neck talkin'
Ooh, and I'm rocking Goyard and Supreme, aye (That's that check)

[Chorus: Comethazine]
Bands-bands-bands, that's a check talkin'
Take off your pants-pants-pants
Bitch ain't no time for talkin'
Watch me do my dance-dance-dance-dance
Bands in my pocket
Come and get your mans-mans-mans
Before I up my rocket
Ouh, bands-bands-bands, that's a check talkin'
Take off your pants-pants-pants
Bitch ain't no time for talkin'
Watch me do my dance-dance-dance-dance
Bands in my pocket
Come and get your mans-mans-mans
Before I up my rocket

[Verse 2: Rich The Kid]
Way too many bands-bands-bands-bands
I've been plug walkin' (what)
Run up on me, hit you with that fan
Got the choppa on me (Graaa)
I might cash out on a Wraith (Wraith)
I got a plug on the way (plug)
Trap open servin' Jay (trap)
Make hundred every day (hunnid)
Bank roll, bank roll, bank roll (bank roll)
Walking 'round with the hundos (hundo)
Rich Forever I'm the huncho (huncho)
I got the cheese, nachos (nachos)
You niggas rapping for promo (hah)
I need a coupe not a four door (skrrt)
These niggas talking to po-po ( po-po)
Stuck to the money like velcro
Still got a beeper (beeper)
She a real eater (eater)
Really nice to meet ya (meet ya)
That's your mamacita (woah)
Callin' my phone I can't pick up
Walk out the bank like a stick up
She coming over and lick up
Take her phone no pictures (Rich)

[Chorus: Comethazine]
Bands-bands-bands, that's a check talkin'
Take off your pants-pants-pants
Bitch ain't no time for talkin'
Watch me do my dance-dance-dance-dance
Bands in my pocket
Come and get your mans-mans-mans
Before I up my rocket
Ouh, bands-bands-bands, that's a check talkin'
Take off your pants-pants-pants
Bitch ain't no time for talkin'
Watch me do my dance-dance-dance-dance
Bands in my pocket
Come and get your mans-mans-mans
Before I up my rocket
Ouh, bands-bands-bands, that's a check talkin'
Take off your pants-pants-pants
Bitch ain't no time for talkin'
Watch me do my dance-dance-dance-dance
Bands in my pocket
Come and get your mans-mans-mans
Before I up my rocket
