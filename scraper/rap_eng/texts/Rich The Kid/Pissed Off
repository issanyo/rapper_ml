[Chorus: Rich The Kid]
She a stupid lil bitch kick her out the vette
I been married to the money playin' with a check
All of my niggas ball on y'all
I bought a rari was pissed off
Stacking my money it's too tall
Whippin' so hard broke my wrist off
She a stupid lil bitch kick her out the vette
I been married to the money playin' with a check
All of my niggas ball on y'all
I bought a Rari was pissed off
Stacking my money it's too tall
Whippin' so hard broke my wrist off

[Verse 1: Lost Boy]
I be fresh to death
Dressed up like a preacher
Bitch I’m always blessed
Riding with a Nina
Wrist game Katrina
Know you niggas mad tho
Louis V the bag tho
Margiela straps tho
Plus i got the straps on me
Diamonds out the ass tho
Gotta run back tho
Gotta break her back tho
Flexin' on her gram tho
Flexin' in the camo

[Verse 2: Goldwood]
I feel like I'm Pablo I feel like Gustavo
Hit the lotto run them bands up the motto
Kick the throttle pop the damn Forgiato
I'm the don of Los Unidos Estados
I'm unique I pop a xan and I geek
Patek Philippe I blew a band in a week
Crush the weed I stuff the green in the bleep
Beat the pussy til I'm fallin' asleep
Young boy I serve like a waiter
Askin me how I get paper
Movin them packs in Decatur
Young boy I ball like a laker
Boy you a snake you spaghetti
Chop off the top with machete
Yo girl she ugly like Betty
Flex on my ex I'm so petty
Pull up on us we be ready

[Chorus: Rich The Kid]
She a stupid lil bitch kick her out the vette
I been married to the money playin' with a check
All of my niggas ball on y'all
I bought a rari was pissed off
Stacking my money it's too tall
Whippin' so hard broke my wrist off
She a stupid lil bitch kick her out the vette
I been married to the money playin' with a check
All of my niggas ball on y'all
I bought a Rari was pissed off
Stacking my money it's too tall
Whippin' so hard broke my wrist off

[Verse 3: Max Gertler]
I been hitting stains I don't fuck with lames
I been ducking Jakes, I been ducking all the cops whoa
I been catching plays countin' money everyday
Get faded plus i'm dripping on the drop
Max been sippin' on wock
Tripping if you think the winning really stop whoa
I been getting money how the fuck u didn’t know
Lost 10 bands when i threw em on the floor
Money gonna change me
This music gonna kill me
I pop 10 pills
Now elvis is in the building
Told the shawty i’d just fall in love with a feeling
I'm robbing and stealing
She top me, the ceiling
I'm raw as, oh shit wait
Was gonna say papes
But 10 deep supply me with boxes
So thanks
I'm making bank, fuck what you thank
Record in my crib you could hear my estate

[Verse 4: Tyrin]
Diamond wet like sweat in a grey jet
Gucci linen bad bitch take her to the MET
Damn I'm so fly like a toucan
I gotta ride I need 2 xans
Heat up yo bitch like it's Sudan
Feet up she suckin her new man
Jules mules
Diamonds all wet like a pool
Cool, with the thool
I was blowin on the fuel
Wreckless pull up with the group
Wet I pull up with the coup
Fresh I roll up on the stoop
Blow loud you blow poo

Everybody want me
But ion want no one else ay
They on a bean she on a bean
Popped a couple myself ay
Stupid lil bitch spilled the ack out
Now ya young nigga gotta act out
Goofy ass niggas wanna go doubt
Only cause ya bish finna go down
She a stupid lil bitch kicked her out the vet
I been married to the money playing w check
All my niggas ball on y'all
I bought a Rari was pissed
Stacking my money it's too tall
Whippin' so hard broke my wrist off

[Chorus: Rich The Kid]
She a stupid lil bitch kick her out the vette
I been married to the money playin' with a check
All of my niggas ball on y'all
I bought a rari was pissed off
Stacking my money it's too tall
Whippin' so hard broke my wrist off
She a stupid lil bitch kick her out the vette
I been married to the money playin' with a check
All of my niggas ball on y'all
I bought a Rari was pissed off
Stacking my money it's too tall
Whippin' so hard broke my wrist off
