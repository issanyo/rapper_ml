[Chorus: Hypo]
Got the AP, that's a buss it down
Got the Rollie, that's a buss it down
Got the whole brick and I buss it down
She 10/10 so I buss her down
Buss it down, buss it down
Buss it down, buss it down
Buss it down, buss it down
Buss it down
Got the AP, that's a buss it down
Got the Rollie, that's a buss it down
Got the whole brick and I buss it down
She 10/10 so I buss her down
Buss it down, buss it down
Buss it down, buss it down
Buss it down, buss it down
Buss it down

[Verse 1: Hypo]
Baby you 10/10, come like a brick of the peng
I might just fuck you again, chop you again and again
She never wreckin' with 'dem, she know we ball in the Prem
All of this money we're spendin', winnin' babe, I got the rent
Half of the niggas are lyin'
Fake ass trappers, no one ain't gettin' no money
All my of niggas are shinin'
Big Kors diamond, no one ain't takin' this from me
All of my niggas on fuckery
Buss up a Rollie, buss up a cheque
Buss up a boy for respect, buss up a chair
Buss up a boy for respect

[Chorus: Hypo]
Got the AP, that's a buss it down
Got the Rollie, that's a buss it down
Got the whole brick and I buss it down
She 10/10 so I buss her down
Buss it down, buss it down
Buss it down, buss it down
Buss it down, buss it down
Buss it down
Got the AP, that's a buss it down
Got the Rollie, that's a buss it down
Got the whole brick and I buss it down
She 10/10 so I buss her down
Buss it down, buss it down
Buss it down, buss it down
Buss it down, buss it down
Buss it down

[Verse 2: Rich the Kid]
(What) I bought a Rollie and bussed it down
Got an AP and it's flooded out
Don't want yo' bitch, I'ma put her out
Sippin' that lean, gotta pour it out
Buss down, you freeze on me right now
Pull up in the coupe, I'm swervin'
Right in the [?], that's no suburban
Buyin' her too many purses
Wanna talk about ice, got all that
Young nigga walkin' around with the big racks
Standin' in the Bentley on the way to the pack
Might take your bitch and I give her back
Buss down, buss down
Got me a chick and I bought her buss down
Ridin' with a chopper, AP and 100 rounds
Bad bitch wanna buss down

[Chorus: Hypo & Suspect]
Got the AP, that's a buss it down
Got the Rollie, that's a buss it down
Got the whole brick and I buss it down
She 10/10 so I buss her down
Buss it down, buss it down
Buss it down, buss it down
Buss it down, buss it down
Buss it down
Got the AP, that's a buss it down
Got the Rollie, that's a buss it down
Got the whole brick and I buss it down
She 10/10 so I buss her down
Buss it down, buss it down
Buss it down (buss it), buss it down (buss it)
Buss it down (buss it), buss it down (buss it)
Buss it down (buss it)

[Verse 3: Suspect]
Touch it
Stepped in the game all icy causing a ruckus
They love it when they see me with [?], face all busted
Came up with nothing, a young niggas takin' the piss
And he ain't taking no shit
Run up on fuck nigga, fu-fu-fu-fuck nigga, fuck nigga wet
Break down a brick, boy we good on these streets
We had no abyss
Then I run on the stage and I buss it down
No played games, man'll buss it now
OTB, yeah we buss it now

[Chorus: Hypo]
Got the AP, that's a buss it down
Got the Rollie, that's a buss it down
Got the whole brick and I buss it down
She 10/10 so I buss her down
Buss it down, buss it down
Buss it down, buss it down
Buss it down, buss it down
Buss it down
Got the AP, that's a buss it down
Got the Rollie, that's a buss it down
Got the whole brick and I buss it down
She 10/10 so I buss her down
Buss it down, buss it down
Buss it down, buss it down
Buss it down, buss it down
Buss it down
