Lyrics from snippet

[Chorus : Rich The Kid]
Okay let's go and pull let's ride, that's right, let's ride
Okay my girl ain't boujee she slide, she slide, that's right
We ain't talkin 'bout money be quiet, be quiet, be quiet

[Verse 1: Rich The Kid]
The fuck is you mad at me?
That's how I had to be
Momma, she proud of me
My bitch [?]
Your niggas is sad to see
I go get the cash and lease
The bentley ain't cappin'
Your niggas is mad at me
You're a switcher for a chain
Imma fuck her in the rain
I wanna give her the fame
I want her all in my plane, huh
You can't have that fame back
Wake up, where my bank at?
Too much drip like where that sink at?
I'm too rich, now I can't go back
Niggas snitching I won't do racks
Rich Forever, boy, you knew that
Platinium plaque, I need more racks

[Chorus : Rich The Kid]
Okay let's go and pull let's ride, that's right, let's ride
Okay my girl ain't boujee she slide, she slide, that's right
We ain't talkin 'bout money be quiet, be quiet, be quiet

[...]

[Chorus : Rich The Kid]
Okay let's go and pull let's ride, that's right, let's ride
Okay my girl ain't boujee she slide, she slide, that's right
We ain't talkin 'bout money be quiet, be quiet, be quiet
