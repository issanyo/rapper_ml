[Chorus]
I'm ready to die like Big, against the world like Pac
I'm ready to die like Big, against the world like Pac
I'm ready to die like Big, against the world like Pac
All I got in this world is the racks and my Glock
I'm ready to die like Big, against the world like Pac
I'm ready to die like Big, against the world like Pac
Ready to die like Big, against the world like Pac
All I got in this world is the racks and my Glock

[Verse 1]
Stick 'em, stick 'em, stick 'em up, stick 'em
Take a nigga racks, and this bitch, it won't miss 'em
Louis, Gucci, Prada cost a couple bands
Hit the mall, I'm spendin', and I blow that money like a fan
Give a fuck about a fuck nigga, no
Bitch, we bustin' at them duck niggas, yeah
Fuck ya bitch like bang bang, hell nah, I don't gangbang
Y'all cuff a hoe, y'all lock 'em up, y'all send them hoes the chain gang
Tatted up like 2Pac, ridin' 'round with two Glocks
That's two guns, that's too much fun, I pull up, y'all niggas run'
Laughin' at y'all niggas 'cause y'all niggas really broke, nigga
Fuckin' with the fuckin' rounds will get you slumped, nigga

[Chorus]
I'm ready to die like Big, against the world like Pac
I'm ready to die like Big, against the world like Pac
I'm ready to die like Big, against the world like Pac
All I got in this world is the racks and my Glock

[Verse 2]
50K on your head, you'll be gone in a day
I got racks, I got bands, hit the mall, and I play
I make your bitch throw up, no money, I don't show up
Youngins on the block make the murder rate go up
I don't even give a fuck about yo' momma, nigga
Talk shit, then you gonna meet the llama, nigga
I ain't even gotta worry 'bout no drama, nigga
A street president, call me Obama, nigga
Backin' Migos, that's the gang
Rich The Kid, nigga, that's the name
I put a bullet in ya brain, you want a [?]
I don't give a fuck about you or your clique
I had your baby momma and your sister suck my dick

[Chorus]
I'm ready to die like Big, against the world like Pac
I'm ready to die like Big, against the world like Pac
I'm ready to die like Big, against the world like Pac
All I got in this world is the racks and my Glock
I'm ready to die like Big, against the world like Pac
I'm ready to die like Big, against the world like Pac
Ready to die like Big, against the world like Pac
All I got in this world is the racks and my Glock
