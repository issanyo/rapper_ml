[Intro]

Trap!

[HOOK]x2

I don't want to sleep no more, no more
I don't want to eat no more, no more
I don't want to drink no more, no more
I don't want to smoke no more, no more
I just want the fucking cash
Put it in the paper bag
Diamonds blind them like they flashing
Bitch I'm rich and niggas mad

[VERSE 1]

Why these niggas mad cause I came up
They don't wanna see me shine but I'm iced up
Stayed on the grind for the blue bucks
I just want the benjamins, count it up!
I can't fuck around with a broke bitch
Too many diamonds in the bezel that's a broke wrist
Can't sleep, I'ma dream about the money
Fuck a ho, I'm trying to get hundreds!
I was broke, I ain't ask for a dollar
Now I'm rich and I'm counting up guala
I was jugging, really taking off masks
Twenty-Fifteen Rari' going fast
Had to get it as a kid, skipped class
Young nigga doing numbers, no math
I know you fake-
Got benjamins all on my dinner plate
I get to the cake
You broke as a bitch and you losing weight
My squad got nothing but them real niggas
If it ain't about the paper can't deal with you
I've been flexing in the mall you can take a picture
Woke up in a Rari' -
Now that I'm rich, no I'm not sorry
Bitches they calling me papi

[HOOK]x2

I don't want to sleep no more, no more
I don't want to eat no more, no more
I don't want to drink no more, no more
I don't want to smoke no more, no more
I just want the fucking cash
Put it in the paper bag
Diamonds blind them like they flashing
Bitch I'm rich and niggas mad

[VERSE 2]

Look at my diamonds, you get blinded
You can't see me shining
You want to hate cause I'm rich?
Thinking you the man, you ain't really doing shit
I don't need nobody
Young nigga came up you can't say nothing about it
Bitch never seen the Bugatti
Benjamins stuffed in my pocket
I'm touring the world
You think that I'm giving the fuck about a girl?
Put me in the bank with a AK
I just want the money, have a nice day
You are no problem
Addicted to paper for money, I rob it!
I ain't gone lie I done been broke
Made it from the chopper with a nice scope
Niggas gotta take care of their family
Your bitch walk in my crib with no panties
Ho look at my diamonds they dancing
Keep staring where the fuck is your manners?
Now that my name is the topic
They flexing on bitches they know that I got it
A hundred can't fit in my wallet
I'm walking around with the commas!

[HOOK]x2

I don't want to sleep no more, no more
I don't want to eat no more, no more
I don't want to drink no more, no more
I don't want to smoke no more, no more
I just want the fucking cash
Put it in the paper bag
Diamonds blind them like they flashing
Bitch I'm rich and niggas mad
