[Verse: Ski Mask The Slump God & Rich The Kid]
--Just like "achoo!"
Diamonds they sick, like I'm the flu
Diamonds be wet, just like the Gram
It's in the booth, it's on the blue, ay
Anywhere the money come with me
The Lamb truck done cost 250
She a model, real ass, but got fake titties (jump, jump, jump)
With a hundred in the Civic and got more it
I'm in the motherfucking dentist, uh
I pour Moet in it (wait)
Measure a boof like it's hennessy, hennessy
