[Hook]
Where that cheddar, where that check because I need that
I'm in the ghost I ride the Bent' like where the keys at?
Bank roll getting bigger, bitch I'm famous take a picture
In the bed with two sisters, Rich the Kid and K Swisha
Bank roll with the rubber band bitch I need that
Ghost I ride the Bent' like where the keys at?
Bank roll with the rubber band bitch I need that
I can't go without the money cause I need that

[Verse 1]
Riding round in a Nissan you a broke boy
You love that bitch I pull a flex and take your hoe boy
I had to run up a sack, fucking your bitch from the back
Phantom I ride in the back, money old like a Cadillac
Diamonds they drip, I do a show and I dip
I got your hoe in the VIP, [?] lean and pourin a zip
Where the check cause I need that
I'm in the ghost where the keys at
I'm in the trap where the bees at
My shooters will kill em' for three stacks
Count the money all day
Your class I was trapping in hallways
Pick up a bitch with blue flame
Freak hoe with two names
I gotta' watch for the snakes
I'm walking round with the k
Money long [?]
Get the check and then I skate

[Verse 2]
Walking round with too many rubber bands
Bitch I'm rich don't give a damn
Break my wrist I'm going ham
I was broke I got a lamb
I fuck your bitch then I leave her
I pick up chicken from [?]
Motto bitch she a diva
I'ma fuck her never eat her
Rich forever, got a deal now
I'm playing round with them mils now
Way too much money I'm throwing them hunnids' out
I got a foreign I swerve
Leaning on Ac' and she nervous
Bitch I'm flexing on purpose
She suck my dick and got a birken
Look at my diamonds they real
Celebrate on a pill
One hunnid' keep it trill
I was broke and had to steal
Look at my tee, it's double G
She a flea  wanna' suck on me
Brought sand to the beach
You ain't rich that's a lease
