[Intro]
Kiing Skrrtt

[Verse 1: Kiing Skrrtt]
I won't have it, I'm a savage
Ice so cold it needs a jacket
If u man get beef den I won't back it
I get dough over and over again like its a habit (bah)
Open it up, bracket
Put it inside, packet
Look at that ass, smack it (bitch)
Huh, What
Look at that ass, smack it
Can't last 10 secs, imma snap it
You man be spech
You niggas b barstars like u came from a creche
If u keep talking u get shanked in the flesh
Man can tell u need some aquafresh
It will give you better breath
Put it to the test
Look at that breast
Underneath that dress
She got back a chest
But imma stay blessed
But once I get that address (woe)
I'll be under arrest

[Chorus: Rich The Kid]
My bitch too foreign, need a visa (ooh)
I don't need her (huh?)
Pull up drop top with a eater (skrrt)
Two seater (skrrt)
New bitch wanna fuck to my AP (AP, ice)
New freezer (ice)
I woke up thinkin' 'bout bands (bands)
Hop off a jet to a check when I land (yuh)
My bitch too foreign, need a visa (bitch)
I don't need her (huh?)
Pull up drop top with a eater (yeah)
Two seater (skrrt, skrrt)
New bitch wanna fuck to my AP (bitch)
New freezer (new freezer)
I woke up thinkin' 'bout bands (new freezer)
Hop off a jet to a check when I land (dat way)

[Verse 2: Kiing Skrrtt]
As high as I seem
No molly, codeine
Got the pain, vaccine
Got the chain, ice cream
Acting fishy, red bream
Going through the extreme
Man ur lips so dry, u might need vasalene
Boost your self esteem
You need some listoreine
Can't concentrate, daydream
Stay fresh, stay clean
Yeah am the rich gene
New freezer with team
Jealous cuz I got the supreme
Saint Laurent on me
Bitch, u wanted me to want you
But ice so cold got the flu
Dumb niggas, no clue
Want beef, go moo
Imma win DAT too
You will never breakthrough
Gold chain, its new

[Chorus: Rich The Kid]
My bitch too foreign, need a visa (ooh)
I don't need her (huh?)
Pull up drop top with a eater (skrrt)
Two seater (skrrt)
New bitch wanna fuck to my AP (AP, ice)
New freezer (ice)
I woke up thinkin' 'bout bands (bands)
Hop off a jet to a check when I land (yuh)
My bitch too foreign, need a visa (bitch)
I don't need her (huh?)
Pull up drop top with a eater (yeah)
Two seater (skrrt, skrrt)
New bitch wanna fuck to my AP (bitch)
New freezer (new freezer)
I woke up thinkin' 'bout bands (new freezer)
Hop off a jet to a check when I land (dat way)
