[Hook: Rich The Kid]
Okay my trap jumping, phone ringing
Bitches wanna fuck me cause my bands beating
Okay my trap jumping, feeling it
I just put that Mazi up for no reason
We give the world Dab fever
Whipping a pan, no Peter
Sippin' a pint, real Easter
Running around with the nina
Yeah the trap still jumping
12 pull up, I'm running
Still stay with that money
Dab fever, cross the country

[Verse 1: Rich The Kid]
Dab fever, sippin' Easter
Bad bitch, Mona Lisa
Strapped up, Desert Eagle
Green salad, no caesar
Boy you lying, straight flexin'
Need the pussy, no textin'
I'm a veteran, you a freshman
Dab school, I give lessons
I was broke with no money
Gnaw on steak when I'm hungry
Blond bitch, she go dummy
All I want is them 100s
Niggas hating on the dab
I'm counting up, do the math
Fuck a bitch, buy a cab
17 bought a jag

[Hook: Rich The Kid]
Okay my trap jumping, phone ringing
Bitches wanna fuck me cause my bands beating
Okay my trap jumping, feeling it
I just put that Mazi up for no reason
We give the world Dab fever
Whipping a pan, no Peter
Sippin' a pint, real Easter
Running around with the nina
Yeah the trap still jumping
12 pull up, I'm running
Still stay with that money
Dab fever, cross the country

[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]
Start car, do this for my block
Tell that shorty give me top
Rolling papers, finna drop
Hit this KK and no cough
Bitch I run it like a relay
Gave it to me once, brought it back like a DJ
Smoking on a freeway
Watch me dab, shout out to Skippa Da Flippa
Break it down, roll me a zipper
Yeah man I'm great, little niggas coming last in the race
So much ash in my tray
So much cash in my safe
Boy I been hitting your phone, that's what all the bad bitches say

[Hook: Rich The Kid]
Okay my trap jumping, phone ringing
Bitches wanna fuck me cause my bands beating
Okay my trap jumping, feeling it
I just put that Mazi up for no reason
We give the world Dab fever
Whipping a pan, no Peter
Sippin' a pint, real Easter
Running around with the nina
Yeah the trap still jumping
12 pull up, I'm running
Still stay with that money
Dab fever, cross the country
