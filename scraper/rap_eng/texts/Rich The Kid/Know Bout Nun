Whole team on fire (on fire), roll that shit, get higher
Burnin' rubber in the Masi until I bust a tire (skrr, bust a tire)
Cooley, Cooley, bitch, I am the shit, you is a liar (you is a liar)
Nigga play with me, I bet today he will expire
Truckload, bitch, I'm gettin' 'em off the boat
Got a condo by the ocean, hoe, I'm livin' by the coast
In that Phantom half a million, bitch, I'm chillin' in a ghost
Watch me do the [?], all that hoe shit for hoes
