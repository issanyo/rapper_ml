Drip drip see my flex, yah (drip, drip)
This goes for my ex, yeah (yeah, yeah)
You just slip, watch your step, yeah

Bottle after bottle, take a sip
Water on my AP, watch it drip
Think I need a napkin for my wrist
All my diamonds dripping, please don't slip
They're (?) trynna get a glimpse

Let the money talk just shut up and listen
