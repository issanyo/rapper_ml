[Intro: Raven Felix]

[Verse 1: Raven Felix]
It’s lights, camera, action
If you wanna deal with me
So you gon have to keep it real with me
(real with me)
If you wanna feel my energy
You gotta show that you into me
You want me to spend the night, yeah
Drop top, bout to take it for a ride, yeah
And I promise that I won’t bite, yeah
Keep pouring the Hennessy
And lets shoot another scene
Now you living out your fantasy
Can you handle me?
Got you calling me a star
First you wanna dance with me
Take a chance with me
Had to take it this far
Now we rollin
Sippin 40oz of the potion
I put it down and we postin
Cuz I got that ass movin slow motion, yeah

[Chorus: Rich The Kid]

And she love the way I do, baby ride it
Don’t hit the wrist, party shop (?)
Baby come and take a ride in my Ferrari

[Verse 2: Raven Felix]
I’m a bad bitch, I know that’s a problem
Yeah, they like the way I do it
Cuz I get it poppin
You got head game
Then give me some knowledge
Turn the camera on, just on me
So you can watch it
You’re the one I wanna chill with, build with
Real shit, mirrors on the ceiling
Yeah, that’s how I’m feelin when I’m in it
Wake up in the AM and it’s still lit
Damn right I be flexing
And I know I’m the one you obsessed with
Angelina Jolie when we sexting
Cuz I can be the star and give you direction, yeah

[Chorus: Rich The Kid]
