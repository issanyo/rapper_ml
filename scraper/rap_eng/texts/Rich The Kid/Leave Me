Ayy, ayy

[Chorus]
Why you, why you wanna leave me, baby? (what?)
You know you drive me crazy (crazy)
And you been drippin' lately (drip)
You know you different, baby (different)
Know you have to suck it right when I come through (come through)
Pick up the phone when I want you (want you)
Pull up like a boss when I come through (come through, ooh)
Pick up the coupe, it's brand new (brand new)

[Verse 1]
Why you wanna leave me, baby? (leave me)
Know that you drive me crazy (crazy)
She wanna ride the Mercedes (Mercedes)
I put her right in the latest (right in the latest)
I was flexing like a bitch 'til the bag came in (bag came in)
Pussy too good, so good, amen
Hate to leave her, gotta get the racks in (racks in)
Money falling, ayy
I'ma fall in it (woah)
Get up all in it (ooh)
She gon' cook me chicken (chicken)
I just want something different (lil' different)
I just might snatch the Porsche (snatch it)
But it's for you of course (for you)
I got the game in sport (sport)
Your boyfriend a lame, a dork (a dork)
She got a bag, she got it
Ain't gotta brag about her (nah)
Don't gotta flex, she poppin' (poppin')
Don't gotta take her shoppin' (nah)
And I do it (do it)
Ran through the money, I blew it (I blew it)
Young rich nigga, she knew it (she knew it)
Fell in love with the pussy, go stupid (rich!)

[Chorus]
Why you, why you wanna leave me, baby? (what?)
You know you drive me crazy (crazy)
And you been drippin' lately (drip)
You know you different, baby (different)
Know you have to suck it right when I come through (come through)
Pick up the phone when I want you (want you)
Pull up like a boss when I come through (come through, ooh)
Pick up the coupe, it's brand new (brand new)

[Verse 2]
I gotta freeze her
She cold like a freezer
Ooh, she a keeper
Red bottom sneakers (red)
Walk with 100, my bag different
I'ma give you the game if you listen
Took her to the island, she missin'
Whole lotta Gucci, she drippin'
Skrrt, skrrt, think I might buy her a new vert
I put Chanel on my T-shirt
I'm fucking it up, and she squirt
Why you gon' leave me?
Bet she don't need me
Hope she believe me
She make it look easy
My bitch, she a boss (boss)
I can't cut her off
I'ma make her cook for me and her ass soft
For her, it's a good day
Bitch, it's the pay way
Might get the green Wraith
Patek got the green face (green)
She deserve it
I'ma give it 'cause she worth it ('cause she worth it)
And I ain't nervous (I ain't nervous)
Ballin' on them niggas like I'm 30

[Chorus]
Why you wanna leave me, baby? (what?)
You know you drive me crazy (crazy)
And you been drippin' lately (drip)
You know you different, baby (different)
Know you have to suck it right when I come through (come through)
Pick up the phone when I want you (want you)
Pull up like a boss when I come through (come through, ooh)
Pick up the coupe, it's brand new (brand new)
