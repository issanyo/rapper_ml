[Intro: Swae Lee]
They can't wait until we turn this bitch upside down
They can't wait until we turn this bitch upside down

[Hook: Swae Lee]
My homies the real deal, we smokin' that kill-kill
She shake it, it feel real
The paper flowin' still, now that bitch wanna chill
Damn, this shit stay chill
My homies the real deal, we smokin' that kill-kill
She shake it, it feel real
The paper flowin' still, now that bitch wanna chill
Damn, this shit stay chill

[Verse: Rich The Kid]
Look at my diamonds, they real deal
In a maybach smokin' on kill kill
At ya partner's head now, no advil
Catch ya bitch, she gon ride like a ferris wheel
Sippin' lean, out of pint, pop a new seal
If a rollie tick tock then it ain't real
Need the racks on time or it's no deal
Tomorrow we made it like mike will
Money comin' in my wrist chill
Ain't sign no deal need 10 mil
Bitch bad but she can't pay her phone bill
Come close, lemme see how the head feel
She gon turn up on the molly
I got more bitches then follies
Boast; all of my pockets are sloppy
I'm fuckin' your bitch in a maserati

[Hook: Swae Lee]
My homies the real deal, we smokin' that kill-kill
She shake it, it feel real
The paper flowin' still, now that bitch wanna chill
Damn, this shit stay chill
My homies the real deal, we smokin' that kill-kill
She shake it, it feel real
The paper flowin' still, now that bitch wanna chill
Damn, this shit stay chill
