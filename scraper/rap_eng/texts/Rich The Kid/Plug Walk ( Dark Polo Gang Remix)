[Ritornello: Rich The Kid]
Ayy, ayy
Plug walk (plug walk, plug, plug)
I don't even understand how the fuck my plug talk (huh? what, what?)
Pick him up in a space coupe, I don't let my plug walk (skrrt, pull up in a space coupe)
New freak, had to cut my other lil' bitch off (ooh, ooh, lil' bitch)
50K, you could come and book a nigga for a plug walk

[Strofa 1: Rich The Kid]
You can't reach me (what?), space coupe like E.T
It's the plug tryna call me (skrrt, skrrt)
I was up trappin' early in the morning (plug)
Ooh, on the wave like a du-rag (du-rag)
Pussy nigga callin' for his boo back (pussy)
Plug walk, Gucci on my shoe racks (Gucci)
Walk up in the house, hit a rat-a-tat
'Til I ran into the plug ('til I ran into the plug)
'Til I ran into the mud (to the mud)
I done ran into some racks, I done ran into your girl (your girl)
Why the plug show me love? (Show me love)
I done came up from a dub (huh?)

[Ritornello: Rich The Kid]
Plug walk (plug walk, plug, plug)
I don't even understand how the fuck my plug talk (huh? what, what?)
Pick him up in a space coupe, I don't let my plug walk (skrrt, pull up in a space coupe)
New freak, had to cut my other lil' bitch off (ooh, ooh, lil' bitch)
50K, you could come and book a nigga for a plug walk

[Strofa 2: Pyrex & TonyEffe]
Dark Walk
Tanti contatti quindi ho due iPhone (brr brr, brr brr)
Valigie in mano sono appena tornato da New York (New York, ey)
Scappo dalla polizia  facendo il Moonwalk  (skrt skrt)
Sono un dark boy, fotto la tua bitch non stop
Guardami mentre spendo ventimila in pubblico
Se mi ferma la Finanza faccio il finto stupido

[Ritornello: Rich The Kid]
Ey, Plug walk (plug walk, plug, plug)
I don't even understand how the fuck my plug talk (huh? what, what?)
Pick him up in a space coupe, I don't let my plug walk (skrrt, pull up in a space coupe)
New freak, had to cut my other lil' bitch off (ooh, ooh, lil' bitch)
50K, you could come and book a nigga for a plug walk
