[Verse 1]
That's wrong, they was hatin' all alone
With the money, not alone
Trap talk on the phone
Wonder why they did hatin' me
One verse that's a rollie
I was runnin' from the police
Servin' the J, he got no teeth
Fit the work like a skateboard
I got the molly she asked for
She gon' talk me in a two doors
Now I'm rich, I want more
That's right
I put your bitch on a flight
I can buy you what you like
I run to the check like a night
Rich forever in these diamonds
You cannot stop me from shining
Look in my rollie, going blind man
Stevie I play with the key but no blind man
That's right, I got rich over night
Sniper hit you in your life

[Verse 2]
You broke to that place with a hunnid bands
You blow diamonds cloudy
Rich niggas all around me
They lookin' at me like a OG
Fuck niggas, all hatin'
I got choppers, puttin' haze
Hit the jewel, hit the jewel
I'm the plug, I'm the plug
Flippin' out work on a [?]
Too many geeks like a genator
Phone rings
[?] bitches drink semen
Flexin' on you my rollie
Hunnid bands carry got it on me
Ask your clips never lonely
You don't want beef you want baloney
That's right, she rode that dick like a bike
I give this bitch what she like
Fuck her, she coming me twice
Big, big, big diamonds
They was hatin' but I'm shining
In the field like a [?]
I'm in the hills you can find me
