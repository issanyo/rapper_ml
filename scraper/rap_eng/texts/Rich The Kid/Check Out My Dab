Check out the way that I dab
Walking around with the cash
I got them haters they mad
She wanna check out my dab
Flexing in them half
Ain't cuffing that bitch we can switch
Pull up I'm dabbing they taking the pics
Check out the way that I dab
Walking around with the cash
I got them haters they mad
She wanna check out my dab
Flexing in them half
Ain't cuffing that bitch we can switch
Pull up I'm dabbing they taking the pics

[Verse 1]
Check out the way that I dab
She look at the Loub's
She wanna fuck in my bed
She wanna make it her move
Capping we still trap in the Rari, I pull up dabbing
We went from a bando to mansion
My diamonds still dancing
Dab with the racks in the Balmaine
Roll you a ice you a plain Jane
Fucking a bitch and I'm dabbing
Racks to the ceiling i'm having
Handcuffing no bitch we switch
The kitchen I'm breaking my wrists
Flexing the dab on purpose
Feels good to be rich I was hurting

[Verse 2]
Ain't cuffing that bitch we can switch
I'm in the trap with the bricks
Dabbing on purpose I'm making em' nervous
I'm pulling right up on your bitch
Dropping the top, doing my dab
That's where we smoking the gas
Pull up on foreign I'm doing the dash
I got them haters they mad
Chuck on my dab and I giving a class
Sipping the lean out a glass
Was broke now I walk with cash
My niggas they take it with no mask
Rollie the dab, with the wrist game
Teaching that dab with the water
Ain't loving no bitches I'm cuffing my riches
I thought that she riding them harder
