[Verse 2: Rich The Kid]
Put a stripper in a Ghost
Diamond white like a ghost
I met a chopper to scribble with me
Fuckin' your bitch, got a chopper with me
Bitch she ain't that fine
Me and Desiign, play with the keys like I'm blind
Wake up with too many hundreds
Tourin' the country, a stripper, she bustin' it for me
I hit the bitch like a hammer
I think she from Canada, I play with the keys like a janitor
I fell in love with a stripper
Dick in her mouth like a pickle
She don't wanna be a freak no more
I don't put her on the geek no more
Water money, can't sleep no more
I need a stripper like three more hoes
Free bands bustin' like strippers
Me and all my money gettin' tickled
I'm in the coupe with two strippers with me
I'm in the jet with a zipper with me
I'ma bust her and delete her
I'ma fuck her, I won't feed her
I'm in the cut with a stripper
She swallowed the cum, but you kiss her
