[Hook: Tate Kobang]
My niggas they came up from nothing
We was just young and was thugging
I left out the house with no money
Came back to the house with the money
Nigga go get you some money
Young nigga get you some money
I had to get  me some money
You can’t got to war with no money
Don’t talk if it ain’t ‘bout that money
We struggle, we ain’t had no money
Them 20’s, them 50’s, them hundreds
I had to go get me some money
Young nigga get you some money
I had to get me some money
I had to get me some money
Yeah I had to get me some money

[Verse 1: Tate Kobang]
I left out the house to the money
Came back to the house the next Monday
I went to church on the Sundays
Thank the lord I got some money
I can’t see my young niggas hungry
We might just go cop us some dummies
We might hit the block with the bunnies
I got to get me some money
I got some kids to feed
I need them M’s, them green
I got that work if you want it, but I just can’t front it
I needs my cream
Get it by any means
I get it by any means
I fell in love with the money
Them 5’s, them 10’s
Them 50’s, them hundreds

[Hook: Tate Kobang]
My niggas they came up from nothing
We was just young and was thugging

You can’t got to war with no money

[Verse 2: YGG Tay]
Ay bro it’s first class when I’m on a flight
All the whips got double pipes
Walk through, don’t stand in line
Cause these Balmain's kinda fight me tight
YOLA money got me living right
Free my nigga, just gave him life
I know it’s crazy but that’s our life
If you get caught then you pay the price
I fell in love with that dough, cheese
I bust my ass ‘til I got it right
Heard that nigga was sneak dissin’
So I fucked his bitch just out of spite
Most niggas ain’t ‘bout shit
85 percent just all hype
All day I think about the money
You don’t think the same, then you not my type

[Hook: Tate Kobang]
My niggas they came up from nothing
We was just young and was thugging
I left out the house with no money
Came back to the house with the money
Nigga go get you some money

[Verse 3: Rich The Kid]
You talkin’ that trap and I live it
You flexing, you riding that semi
I got your bitch looking for the ceiling
I was just broke, now I got a milly
Look at my Rolex, a bust down
Ho pull up, she gon’ fuck now
I was on the grind, had to stay down
Now my money longer than a Greyhound
All of my niggas official
Flippa got choppers, I swear he won’t miss you
Now that bitch wanna take a ride with me
One chain on my neck cost 250
I just hit a lick and bought a new coupe
She ain’t tryna fuck, I hit her with the boot
Pull up in the city with a missing roof
Ain’t playin’, bitch my diamonds playin’ peekaboo

[Hook: Tate Kobang]
My niggas they came up from nothing
