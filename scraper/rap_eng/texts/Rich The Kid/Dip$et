Jr Writer

It don't get graded, it naw
I just be raising the bar
I roll up with so many Cubans
You think I'm making cigars
Niggas be lacking, think I'm just rapping
I'm busy gaming they broads
Bitches I mack em' ask Tony Braxton
You won't see bae till tomorrow
Yeah, I fuck your bitch and I dipset
You can come get her I've been left
She had a shape like an hourglass
I thought I may needed windex
Wanted to go where the kids stay
I told her wait like a bench press
Then (?) DeKembe
She got the wave of an index

No No
Where you think you going girl
Here go the key to the tele
Woah Woah
I just get low in the V
And then breeze on parellies
Oh No
These bitches don't go to the crib
Picture them know where I live
I don't be playing them games
You know what it is
