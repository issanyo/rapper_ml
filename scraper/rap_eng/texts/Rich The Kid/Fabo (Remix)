[Chorus]
I went and called young Illz, he come and pour it in my Faygo
Nigga try run up but I keep the K, it came wit' a potato
Baby she grabbin' my dick, I told her leggo of my Eggo
Baby she checkin' my swag
She wanna build with me like motherfuckin' legos
Uno I came with the chopper
I leave a hole in you like motherfuckin' bagels
Girl don't you listen to them little niggas
I swear they be telling them fables
All of these bitches be watching me 'cause I'm the plug like a motherfuckin' cable
Hop on the back of that bitch tell her giddy up like that hoe fresh out the stable

[Verse 1: UnoTheActivist]
Pop me a perc and I lose it
But I never thought I was even that stable
Kicks is so fresh that I grab on my shoe and tell 'em I feel just like Fabo
Nigga fuck wit' me I put a bullet in his head now he got a lil' halo
Yeah, it's some lil niggas I do not fuck with they from Clay Co
Posted up wit yo main bitch, you lookin a little embarrassed, huh
Posted with yo little hoe you was planning for marriage
Ride on that back of that bitch like a carriage
I'm gonna hide in the bush, I feel like a motherfuckin' bear
Baby she rise to the top of that dick like a motherfuckin'
Ferris - wheel
Choppa sit right on my shoulder like motherfuckin' parrots
Huh, killed the rabbit took the carrots
Lil baby digging me she say she like my appearance

[Chorus]
I went and called young Illz, he come and pour it in my Faygo
Nigga try run up but I keep the K, it came wit' a potato
Baby she grabbin' my dick, I told her leggo of my Eggo
Baby she checkin' my swag
She wanna build with me like motherfuckin' legos
Uno I came with the chopper
I leave a hole in you like motherfuckin' bagels
Girl don't you listen to them little niggas
I swear they be telling them fables
All of these bitches be watching me 'cause I'm the plug like a motherfuckin' cable
Hop on the back of that bitch tell her giddy up like that hoe fresh out the stable

[Verse 2: Rich The Kid]
Three Molly got me geeked like Fabo
Still puttinâ€™ lean in my Faygo
Tell her leggo of my Eggo, she a foreign eat dick like egg roll
I used to trap the beans, I let her fuck the team
Pick up the check, I leave, D4L, call me Fabo I'm geekin'
Hundred band cash, I was born with the racks
The coupe is disabled
Bitch wanna fuck, she give me the top, ain't calling her later
Real diamond, this Goyard on me, bitch I'm a player
There's some lil niggas I don't fuck with, better say them a prayer
Ouh, I might pull up with your bitch, now you embarassed
Ouh, the money is on like my bitch, need me a Halle Berry
Ouh, all this money stackin' up, need me a secretary
Lean with it, in the kitchen, rock with it

[Chorus]
I went and called young Illz, he come and pour it in my Faygo
Nigga try run up but I keep the K, it came wit' a potato
Baby she grabbin' my dick, I told her leggo of my Eggo
Baby she checkin' my swag
She wanna build with me like motherfuckin' legos
Uno I came with the chopper
I leave a hole in you like motherfuckin' bagels
Girl don't you listen to them little niggas
I swear they be telling them fables
All of these bitches be watching me 'cause I'm the plug like a motherfuckin' cable
Hop on the back of that bitch tell her giddy up like that hoe fresh out the stable
