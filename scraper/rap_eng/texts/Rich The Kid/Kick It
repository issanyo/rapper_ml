[Hook – Rich The Kid][x2]
Your bitch wanna kick it with a young rich nigga
Imma hit it like shrimp
Your bitch wanna kick it with a young rich nigga
Wanna ride up in the Fisker
Bitch wanna kick it with a rich nigga
She just wanna kick it with a rich nigga
She just wanna kick it with a rich nigga
She just wanna kick it with a rich nigga

[Verse 1 – Rich The Kid]
I knew the bitch was a gold digger
Groupie ass ho, like the feds, take a picture
Got her out the mud, I’m a young rich nigga
Imma hit your girl then you come get her
Flexing, better know that I’m having
I was really hitting plays, I ain’t talking John Madden
We done hit a move, now everybody dabbing
The plug, he look like Aladdin
Y’all was sleeping on me so I had to wake em up
I just want the neck, I ain’t even tryna fuck
Your bitch wanna kick it with a rich nigga
I done came from the bottom, now I made it
For days I ain’t even had a dollar
Now I’m counting up bands till tomorrow
You be kissing, she sucking and she swallow
Broke nigga, 30 deep in the club with one bottle

[Hook][x2]

[Verse 2 – Skippa Da Flippa]
Foreign little groupie, I know she’s no citizen
Let her suck it while I count on my dividends
I count up my thirty and then count up ten again
Me and Rel Money just touched down in Michigan
Rigged [?] to hit the blocks, she wanna fuck on a young nigga, nonstop
Ammo and magnums are always in stock
My toes get to curling when she lick the cock
In that bitch [?], my diamonds on glacier, you know they gon freeze here
Backend [?] a ticket on meeting her
Pussy so good like I sawed off my pivot
Ooh, I’m having, my dabbing's exquisite
Had the beef come with brisk [?] not [?] and biscuits
Need a rap [?], low key do the Henny
Passing my cup then I go swipe the Bentley
