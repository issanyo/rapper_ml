Trust me Danny

[Chorus]
Listen up (listen up)
Way too much cash, can't lift it up (what)
You got a bag, ain't big enough (bag)
I do the dash, digital (skrr, huh)
Listen up (listen up)
I'm in the Lamb, switch it up (what)
I want the neck, suck it up (suck it up)
Back in the trap, whip it up (what)
She want a bag, huh? (bag, huh?)
She want a Jag, huh? (she want a Jag, huh?)

Let me fuck one time, let me fuck one time (what)
I just blow her mind, we don't spend no time (lil' bitch)
Pinky ring on shine, pinky ring on shine
She be on my line, I just hit decline (yuh, yuh, yuh)
Pull out the Lamb often (skrr)
I just wanna flex, and they salty (salty)
She got a Benz, she bossy (bossy)
You a lil' bitch, we ballin' (ballin')
Back of the back (back)
Real freaky I'ma bust on her tat (her tats)
Got too many racks (racks)
23 like I'm back in the trap (trap)
She want a bag, huh? (bag, huh?)
I'ma smash, call a cab, huh? (skrr)
In love with the money on any day (any day)
Smoking on cookie that's from the bay
Woke up

Broke niggas still ridin' the wave (the wave)

Racks on me, Goyard on my waist (rich)

Ain't cuffin', I kick her out (she out)
I had to trap out the house (trap)
Ooh, I don't want her 'cause she ran through (huh)
You wanna ball, I'll teach you (I'll teach you)
