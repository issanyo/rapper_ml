[Chorus: Desiigner]
Getting money, yeah we going
All my niggas yeah we going
Big diamonds yeah it's glowing, it's glowing
Gucci down when I go in
Every time, we mobbin' 54 in
Desiigner rocking in foreign
Drive the coupe, I got a xanny
Drive the coupe, I got a friendy
Drive a new Bugatti, gettin' it
Drive a new Bugatti, gettin' it
Drive the coupe, I got a xanny
Everyone poppin', going

[Verse 1: Desiigner]
Getting money, yeah we all in
Pop a bottle, yeah we all in
Chop a whole 8th my niggas all in, all in
Drop the roof, we got to get it
Drop the roof, we got to get it
Everyone poppin' it, ay ay ay, going!
Gettin' money, yeah I'm touring
Cross seas, yeah it's all in
Flow poppin', four in, hallway
In the bed she be scoring
Fuck a bitch, it's a foreign
Pull up in the morning

[Bridge: Desiigner]
White girl, white girl

White girl, white girl (Wildin for Wallet)

[Chorus: Desiigner]
Getting money, yeah we going

[Verse 2: Rich The Kid]
New coupe, I got the foreign
She'll suck me 'til the morning
Switch the Porsche to Lamborghini
Bitches they fuck when they see me
I put that little bitch in Gucci
My wrist Jacuzzi, foreign I bust in her pussy
I got a hundred blue hundreds, a bankroll
Rake in my money, I stack up my Legos
Honcho, throw me an elbow
I hit the plug for the pesos
Break down the pack and it's going
Walk in the trap and it's snowing
I put your bitch on recording
Flexing On Purpose, not sorry
Mama I bought me a Rari
Woke up in the kitchen, I whip a Bugatti
Yeah, dat way
Foreign lil' model, might put her on the runway
Plug still calling, put Desiigner on, three way
Young rich niggas sellin' bricks on eBay
Yeah, dat way
Touch down on the plug like Green Bay
I'm a fucking rockstar like Green Day
And my diamonds 3D like Blu-ray

[Chorus: Desiigner]
Getting money, yeah we going
All my niggas yeah we going
Big diamonds yeah it's glowing, it's glowing
Gucci down when I go in
Every time, we mobbin' 54 in
Desiigner rocking in foreign
Drive the coupe, I got a xanny
Drive the coupe, I got a friendy
Drive a new Bugatti, gettin' it
Drive a new Bugatti, getting it
Drive the coupe, I got a xanny
Everyone poppin' it, ay ay ay

[Verse 3: Quavo]
Throwing money out a drop-top, out a drop-top
Hot spot is a hot spot is a hot spot
Big knots, got big knots, got wristwatch
Young nigga, goddamn, why you got the trap hot?
Fuck up the pot, fuck on the thots
Look at my watch, booger my watch
Ay, I call the shots, niggas they plot
I'm having clips, niggas gon' drop
I got the fire, don't want me to pop
I bought the coupe, right off the lot
We back in business, stack up a milli
Pour me a four in a twenty ounce, still cannot feel it

[Chorus: Desiigner]
Getting money, yeah we going
All my niggas yeah we going
Big diamonds yeah it's glowing, it's glowing
Gucci down when I go in
Every time, we mobbin' 54 in
Desiigner rocking in foreign
Drive the coupe, I got a xanny
Drive the coupe, I got a friendy
Drive a new Bugatti, gettin' it
Drive a new Bugatti, getting it
Drive the coupe, I got a xanny
Everyone poppin' it, going

[Outro: Desiigner]
Black girl, black girl
