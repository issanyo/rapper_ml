[Hook: Famous Dex & Rich The Kid]
We was broke, we rich forever
Yeah I put that on my mother
M&M’s, never struggle
I got two bitches, they kiss each other
All my houses got range
And now I’m geeking on the stage
I was juggin’ 9th grade
Half a million on the wraith
I was known for juggin’ work
Masked up like The Purge
I’m juggin’ so hard man it hurt their nerves
Going up your bitch skirt
Pop up, put you on shirt
Diamonds they hang out the Wraith when I swerve
Kill the pussy, I’ma beat it then you eat it
Fuck with them racks, I don't need em

[Verse 1: Famous Dex & Rich The Kid]
I’m working all night, looking for a hater
Supreme on a nigga like a fucking skater
You run up on me, get the vapor
My money tall as skyscraper
And me and Rich up in a Masi
All tats up on my body
And yeah I’m looking for a hotty
I put my dick up in her tummy
Tap in the pussy, it’s water
She eat up the dick and I swear that she gorgeous
Call you an Uber, can’t stay ‘til the morning
Pinky ring'll pay your mortgage
I fuck that bitch until the morning
My dick up in her like she yawning
I put my kids up in her throat
And now this bitch screaming “Maury!”

[Verse 2: Famous Dex & Rich The Kid]
Forever getting to the riches
I’m in the coupe with two bitches
Ten mil for the last
I was broke, no cable
Coming up, I’ma scope it
House known for the roaches
He got the money, I poke him
Find a nigga through a joker
Kick door, was stealing your TV
I pull out a gun no BB
I was young on the corner
Now the Wraith is matte black when I pull up
My necklace is sick like Ebola
Put holes in your head like a doughnut
Hold up, walk around, pockets too swole up
Hold up, diamonds so cold, get a cold cut
Woah, damn, pour a little six in my soda
Yeah, woah, I fuck every lil bitch that you know bruh
Damn, woah, I’m rich forever, getting more bucks
