[Intro: Famous Dex]
No, No, read about this shit
You know what I'm sayin'?
See about everything that's goin' on, ya dig?
Dexter
Fuck a lil bitch, tell her read
Fuck a lil bitch, tell her read
I got them diamonds on me
See about it, I got the money, they be about it
I got the money, they be about it

[Chorus: Rich The Kid]
Read about it
I woke up flexing, I dreamed about it
I'm thanking god and nobody
These niggas is fraud, they so sorry
Stacking more paper than libraries
My niggas they legendary
Sip out my cup, it's the muddy scary
I tell your bitch to go read about it
Read about it
I woke up flexing, I dreamed about it
I'm thanking god and nobody
These niggas is fraud, they so sorry
Stacking more paper than libraries
My niggas they legendary
Sip out my cup, it's the muddy scary
I tell your bitch to go read about it

[Verse 1: Famous Dex]
Read about it
I get the money they see about it
Your diamonds ain't real, boy you dream about it
You say you got money then be about it
Ah-woah, remember they said I wouldn't make it
Back in the day used to trap in the basement
Left wrist cost eighty
I know these people can't take me
Wait, pulled up in the Lam like who is that?
Yeah it's just me and your bitch
Diamonds on my wrist and they glisten
Your man don't flex like this
Wait, pulled up in the Lam like who is that?
Me, my bitch, and her friend
Rich Forever, yeah we winning
Call up Jay Critch, yeah we did it again
Dexter

[Chorus: Rich The Kid]
Read about it, read about it
I woke up flexing, I dreamed about it
I'm thanking god and nobody
These niggas is fraud, they so sorry
Stacking more paper than libraries
My niggas they legendary
Sip out my cup, it's the muddy scary
I tell your bitch to go read about it
Read about it
I woke up flexing, I dreamed about it
I'm thanking god and nobody
These niggas is fraud, they so sorry
Stacking more paper than libraries
My niggas they legendary
Sip out my cup, it's the muddy scary
I tell your bitch to go read about it

[Verse 2: Jay Critch]
Read about it
All of my niggas they synced up
They tryna copy the wave
But these niggas nothing like us
How these niggas throwin' shade
I'm getting paid, diamonds they brighter
Smokin' cookies to the face
Broke in the days, young nigga piped up
She in my face, calling me bae
I'ma go pipe her
That money ain't going away, that's every day
Shooters they snipe ya
I'ma go put my wrist on ice
I'm on a P, just boolin' like Mike
Rich Forever what your bitch like
Call up the DJ, play that twice
I'm ballin' hard, need a replay
Sportscenter, top 10 highlights
Might put your broad up on eBay
He ain't gettin' no racks, he tight
Swear to god I was broke for a minute
Had to do the math, add up them digits
And I got a bankroll in my denim
Try to touch this cash, nigga you finished

[Chorus: Rich The Kid]
Read about it, read about it
I woke up flexing, I dreamed about it
I'm thanking god and nobody
These niggas is fraud, they so sorry
Stacking more paper than libraries
My niggas they legendary
Sip out my cup, it's the muddy scary
I tell your bitch to go read about it
Read about it
I woke up flexing, I dreamed about it
I'm thanking god and nobody
These niggas is fraud, they so sorry
Stacking more paper than libraries
My niggas they legendary
Sip out my cup, it's the muddy scary
I tell your bitch to go read about it
