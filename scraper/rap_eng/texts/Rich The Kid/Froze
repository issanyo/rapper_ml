[Hook: Warhol]
Aye, chest on froze, diamonds wet just like Voss
I ain't never need attention, niggas workin' sayin' a boss
Big boss, I got big bands in these Ricky pants what it cost
Air Force One like chalk, new whip cream like Off-White
Ain't picking no fights, folks 'nem came wit' a pipe
Right, sippin' on Sprite, dirty wit' the ice
Yuh, yeah I'm high, high like a kite
Aye, G5 ride, nigga take a flight

[Verse 1: Warhol]
Woah, yellow diamonds shock a nigga just like Pikachu
Peepin' through the peephole with a big pole like, nigga, Peek-a-boo
Talkin' all that tough shit, I'm a real nigga, so I see right though
Run a nigga main hoe like Tango, he ain't even have a clue
And I'm the truth, ay, I'm the one that they can't tame
Pick up the pace, and we switching these lanes
Red beam on, don't need no aim
Chop up the brick I'm like a Peewee the chef
Hundred round drum and it came wit' a TEC
Niggas gon' hate when I count up that check
Bulletproof wraith, it came with a vest
Hoe I need top Ion need no sex
Rich lil' nigga Ion need no stress
Fuck these niggas, big K, no kick
Pulled up, E wit' me we po' up the bricks
Sippin' on Tech like a young nigga sick
Balmain Jeans but the racks don't fit
Bad lil' bit' wanna suck like a tic
Lame ass nigga look just like a lick

[Hook: Warhol]
Aye, chest on froze, diamonds wet just like Voss
I ain't never need attention, niggas workin' sayin' a boss
Big boss, I got big bands in these Ricky pants what it cost
Air Force One like chalk, new whip cream like Off-White
Ain't picking no fights, folks 'nem came wit' a pipe
Right, sippin' on Sprite, dirty wit' the ice
Yuh, yeah I'm high, high like a kite
Aye, G5 ride, nigga take a flight

[Verse 2: Rich the Kid]
She pop a pill, take flight
I put my cup on ice
I put my wrist on ice
Pussy so good, I might fuck her twice
Pull up, Off-White
My shooters pull up in the daylight
No yellow, I'm sippin' on Act right
I fuck her one time, got her back right
I don't even want that Wock
I tell her "give me the top"
Rich Forever, we on top
In Hollywood straight from the block
She want a brand new Benz
I want some brand new twins
I told her bring brand new friends
Rich Forever, I get to the dividends

[Verse 3: Jay Critch]
Niggas say they want problems, well let's get it then
All these Instagram models, I'm swimming in
Want the money, you worried 'bout fittin' in
Spend it all, make them commas gon' flip again
And that foreign is white, look like Eminem
And that money is talkin, I'm listenin'
Baby, I'm flexin' up like I hit the gym
Baby, Ima count up, get my wrist on swim
Like magic, in the coupe, fly past ya
Ima make a movie, niggas actors
How you always lose, that's tragic
I'm in Louie shoes smokin' jattic
I don't want your boo, you can have it
And I'm in the loop, you a has been
And I love the loot wit' a passion

[Hook: Warhol]
Aye, chest on froze, diamonds wet just like Voss
I ain't never need attention, niggas workin' sayin' a boss
Big boss, I got big bands in these Ricky pants what it cost
Air Force One like chalk, new whip cream like Off-White
Ain't picking no fights, folks 'nem came wit' a pipe
Right, sippin' on Sprite, dirty wit' the ice
Yuh, yeah I'm high, high like a kite
Aye, G5 ride, nigga take a flight
