[Intro: Famous Dex]
Uh yah
Uh yah, uh yah
Oh what?
Now I be gone off the Lean, the pills
The molly, and the Percs
OHMANGOTDDAMN!

[Hook: Famous Dex]
I got the drugs in me
I got the drugs in me
I got the drugs in me
I'm gone off pills and Hennessy
I be turnin' up my shows
I be coolin' with the bros
I can never trust these hoes
I got the drugs in me
I got the drugs in me
I got the drugs in me
I got the drugs in me
I'm gone off pills and Hennessy
I be turnin' up my shows
I be coolin' with the bros
I can never trust these hoes
I got the drugs in me

[Verse 1: Famous Dex]
I got the drugs on me
I'm bustin' off Ecstasy
She say I'm her man
I'm married to money, I can't say a thing
I be geekin' in the lobby
All these tats on my body
3 bitches in the party
I'm drinkin' lean not Bacardi
I poured me a 6 till I doses
I'm flexin' soo hard in my overalls
And baby geekin' off the percs
I'm goin' right up when I I skurt
4k for the purse, you didn't know Dexter was a flirt
Baby girl, what you worth?
All these drugs like a nurse

[Hook: Famous Dex]
I got the drugs in me
I got the drugs in me
I got the drugs in me
I'm gone off pills and Hennessy
I be turnin' up my shows
I be coolin' with the bros
I can never trust these hoes
I got the drugs in me
I got the drugs in me
I got the drugs in me
I got the drugs in me
I'm gone off pills and Hennessy
I be turnin' up my shows
I be coolin' with the bros
I can never trust these hoes
I got the drugs in me

[Verse 2: Rich The Kid]
I got the drugs in me
That syrup you drinkin' in Hennessy
Half a pint or 2 liter
In the coupe with 2 ninas
I drop a grip on my ring
Rich Forever on the chain
Jumpin' through your bitch at the Blue Flame
Maserati matt black, no Bruce Wayne
I need my medicine
Ride around in the coupe, goin' crazy in Beverly
I'm a motherfuckin' chemist in the kitchen doin' chemistry
Walkin' around with that MAC chicken
Empty the clip leave your face missin'
In the kitcken whippin' 33 bricks, that's a Scottie Pippen

[Hook: Famous Dex]
I got the drugs in me
I got the drugs in me
I got the drugs in me
I'm gone off pills and Hennessy
I be turnin' up my shows
I be coolin' with the bros
I can never trust these hoes
I got the drugs in me
I got the drugs in me
I got the drugs in me
I got the drugs in me
I'm gone off pills and Hennessy
I be turnin' up my shows
I be coolin' with the bros
I can never trust these hoes
I got the drugs in me
