[Intro: Kodie Shane]
No, like babe [?]

[Chorus: Kodie Shane]
You hit my phone, you said I'm childish
I hit you back like "babe, you drunk or somethin'"
You text me now like "babe, I miss you though"
And now I know you must be drunk or somethin'
You must be drunk or somethin', woah

[Verse 1: Kodie Shane]
Brand new whip, no mileage
Brand new bitch, I'm a stylist
Bad bitch, she do no smilin'
Brand new AP, no diamonds
No, no way talkin' to us
Voices in my head, keep quiet
These girls keep talkin' too much
I don't know what they want, keep quiet
This money multiplyin'
These girls, they always lyin'
You know this water on me, now I feel just like Poseidon
I think I need her and her friend 'cause I don't like decidin'
And I heard that you're still in love with me but I'll keep quiet

[Chorus: Kodie Shane]
You hit my phone, you said I'm childish
I hit you back like "babe, you drunk or somethin'"
You text me now like "babe, I miss you though"
And now I know you must be drunk or somethin'
You must be drunk or somethin', woah
You must be drunk or somethin', woah
Yeah, you must be drunk or somethin'
You must be drunk or somethin', woah

[Verse 2: Rich the Kid]
Dive on your bitch like I'm drunk or somethin'
I'm flexin' blue hundreds, might pull up on you
[?] I'm drippin' on 'em
Got rich [?], I switched up on her
Young nigga, turn my wrist into a new freezer (ice)
In a coupe with three hoes, that's a two-seater (what?)
Bitch wanna go that way, new Beamer
See you tryna run away, got a desert eagle
You scrapin' pennies, I might put her in a Fendi
The Wraith, I might go get the Bentley
They hate but they pockets is empty
For real though, I put your bitch on the pill though
These niggas, they talk to the pillows (what?)
Bitch [?]

[Chorus: Kodie Shane]
You hit my phone, you said I'm childish
I hit you back like "babe, you drunk or somethin'"
You text me now like "babe, I miss you though"
And now I know you must be drunk or somethin'
You must be drunk or somethin', woah
You must be drunk or somethin', woah
Yeah, you must be drunk or somethin'
You must be drunk or somethin', woah

[Outro: Kodie Shane]
Woah, woah
Oh yeah
Yeah
Why you do this?
