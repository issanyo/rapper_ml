[Intro]
Spillin' Rosé on my new shoes
Dom Pérignon

[Chorus]
I'm so fly, catch me in the sky, nigga I be high
Bitches cry when I ride by wishin' they could ride
I'm so fly, catch me in the sky, nigga I be high
Bitches cry when I ride by wishin' they could ride
I'm so fly, catch me in the sky, nigga I be high
Bitches cry when I ride by wishin' they could ride
I'm so fly, catch me in the sky, nigga I be high
Bitches cry when I ride by wishin' they could ride

[Verse 1]
I'm so high, blowin' on that gas, I'mma bust yo' ass
I'mma blast if you play with cash (bow), nigga you won't last (grra)
I got racks in both pockets, I got hella bands (racks)
Magic City money, I'mma do that money dance (turn up)
Nigga, I'mma drink Rosé, nigga, every night (that Rosé)
If you playin' with my money, then we gonna fight
All up in your bitch, wet, and she super tight (ha, your bitch)
If she tryna get that dick, I'mma get it right (yeah)
Riding down 85, motherfuck the limit (skrr)
Got yo' bitch in the passenger, I know she with it (haha)
Blowin' gas, bruh, yeah 35
Extendo (bow), shot and let it ride

[Chorus]
I'm so fly, catch me in the sky, nigga I be high
Bitches cry when I ride by wishin' they could ride
I'm so fly, catch me in the sky, nigga I be high
Bitches cry when I ride by wishin' they could ride
I'm so fly, catch me in the sky, nigga I be high
Bitches cry when I ride by wishin' they could ride
I'm so fly (skrr), catch me in the sky, nigga I be high
Bitches cry when I ride by wishin' they could ride (skrr)

[Verse 3]
I am smokin' on that Keisha, foreign bitch, her name Felicia
[?] gon' use a visa, Puerto Rican, her name Lisa
Bally Bentley when I'm ridin' through the city (skrr)
I be feelin' like I'm Diddy, and I got a J.Lo with me (bitch)
Gas, nigga (gas), straight from Afghan (Afghan)
Got a pound (pound) on my nightstand (wow)
She just roll it up (roll up), and then we catch a flight (bye)
Fuck yo' bitch (ha), but I never keep her overnight
They wonder why I fly like a kite, dog (kite)
You a lame, I ain't nothin' like ya (a lame)
Cash money (cash), cash money (cash)
Been about the Benjamins, I got money

[Chorus]
I'm so fly, catch me in the sky, nigga I be high
Bitches cry when I ride by wishin' they could ride
I'm so fly, catch me in the sky, nigga I be high
Bitches cry when I ride by wishin' they could ride
I'm so fly, catch me in the sky, nigga I be high
Bitches cry when I ride by wishin' they could ride
I'm so fly, catch me in the sky, nigga I be high
Bitches cry when I ride by wishin' they could ride
