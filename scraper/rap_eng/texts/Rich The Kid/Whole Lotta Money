[Verse 1]
I met your girl on the beach
You riding around in a lease
Made a milli with a triple beam
Fuck your bitch, break her spleen
Come to my mansion, we having a party
She hop on the dick and she ride like a Harley
Smoking a pound like Bob Marley
Bitch, I take off like a spaceship
Kissing that hoe, but she basic
Rich forever, I done made it
Drinking a bottle, I'm faded
I do not pick up no phone calls
Girl goin' wild, that's a party
I need them clothes off your body

[Hook]
I got money wrapped in a rubber band
That's a whole lotta money, whole lotta money
I be walking 'round with a whole lotta money
I got money stacked in a rubber band
That's a whole lotta money, whole lotta money
I be walking 'round with a whole lotta money

[Hook]
I got money stacked in a rubber band
That's a whole lotta money, whole lotta money
I be walking 'round with a whole lotta money

[Verse 2]
My money don't fit in a rubber band
I got them choppers, Afghanistan
My shooters, they pull up like Taliban
Rollie cost a hundred bands
Wake up, was dreamin' a check
Rich Forever 'round my neck
Pinky ring extra wet, lotta money for a bet
Fifty racks in each pocket, I be walking with it
You a broke riding 'round in a Honda Civic
In a Maserati, flexin'
Bitch I had to get it
Look at my necklace, it cost me a chicken
I gotta take care of my family
Ain't worried that I got 'em right next to me
Trap nigga, high school with a felony
Got a whole lotta money, what you telling me?

[Hook]
I got money wrapped in a rubber band
That's a whole lotta money, whole lotta money
I be walking 'round with a whole lotta money
I got money stacked in a rubber band
That's a whole lotta money, whole lotta money
I be walking 'round with a whole lotta money

[Outro]
Whole lotta money
I be walking 'round with a whole lotta money
Rich
