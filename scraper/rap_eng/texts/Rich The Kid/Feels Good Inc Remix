[Intro: 2D & Rich The Kid]
Feels good, feels good, feels good
Feels good, feels good, feels good
Feels good, feels good, feels good
Feels good, feels good, feels good

[Verse 1: Rich The Kid]
I took my momma to Hollywood
Fuck a bitch in a coupe and it feel good
Everything real lavish
I stay with Gorillaz my niggas is savage
Diamonds on her I might take her to Tiffanys
Fucked her once real good now she missin' me
Rari, I bought a horse, literally
Fall In love with Milan, Italy
Once I killed that you can have her back
Too much cash make me laugh, hilarious
Too much flexin' got her mad, apparently
Thank god for the blessings
Feel good that my money straight
Pop a pill I get too geeked
Walking around ain't got no sleep
In love with the money we married
Drop a check all in Goyard Paris

[Hook: 2D & Rich The Kid]
Windmill, windmill for the land
Turn forever hand in hand
Take it all in on your stride
It is sticking, falling down
Love forever, love is free
Let's turn forever, you and me
Windmill, windmill for the land
Is everybody in?

[Verse 2: 2D]
City's breaking down on a camel's back
They just let it go ‘cause they don't know whack
So all you fill the streets, it's appealin' to see
You won't get out the county ‘cause you're bad and free
You got a new horizon, it's ephemeral style
A melancholy town where we never smile
And all I wanna hear is the message beep
My dreams, they gotta kiss it, 'cause I don't get sleep, no...

[Hook: 2D & Rich The Kid]
Windmill, windmill for the land
Turn forever hand in hand
Take it all in on your stride
It is sticking, falling down
Love forever, love is free
Let's turn forever, you and me
Windmill, windmill for the land
Is everybody in?

[Verse 3: De La Soul]
Laughing gas these hazmats, fast cats
Lining 'em up like ass cracks
Ladies, ponies at the track
It's my chocolate attack
Shit, I'm steppin' in heart of this here (yeah)
Care Bear rappin' in heart of this here (yeah)
Watch me as I gravitate, hahahahaha
Yo, we gon' ghost town this Motown
With yo' sound, you in the blink
Gon' bite the dust, can't fight with us
With yo' sound you kill the inc
So don't stop, get it, get it (get it)
Until you're cheddar header
You watch the way I navigate, hahahahaha

[Reprise: 2D]
Shake it, shake it — shake it, feels good
Shake it, shake it — shake it, feels good
Shake it, shake it — shake it, feels good
Shake it, shake it — shake it, feels good

[Hook: 2D & Rich The Kid]
Windmill, windmill
Hand in hand
Windmill, windmill for the land
Turn forever hand in hand
Take it all in on your stride
It is sticking, falling down
Love forever, love is free
Let's turn forever, you and me
Windmill, windmill for the land
Is everybody in?

[Outro: De La Soul]
Don't stop, get it, get it
We are your captains in it
Steady, watch me navigate, hahahahaha
Don't stop, get it, get it
We are your captains in it
Steady, watch me navigate, hahahahaha

Shake it, shake it — shake it, feels good
Shake it, shake it — shake it, feels good
Shake it, shake it — shake it, feels good
Shake it, shake it — shake it, feels good
