[Hook]
Liar, Liar, Liar, Liar
I ain't never been a loser
I spent a grip at the jeweler
Bitch, I dropped my wrist in a cooler
I need the syrup like pancakes
You aren't iced up, that's fake
Flexing around, not a liar
I set the city on fire
Liar, Liar, Liar, Liar
I ain't never been a loser
I spent a grip at the jeweler
Bitch, I dropped my wrist in a cooler
I need the syrup like pancakes
You aren't iced up, that's fake
Flexing around, not a liar
I set the city on fire

[Verse 1]
Boy, you riding in a rental
Two bitches, I'm stuck in the middle
Woah boy, you a liar
I fuck her, she seein like Mariah
I got the trap jumpin' like
I got your bitch ridin' like
I got to win, I get the check and I spend it
I don't need no friends
Water, water, water, water
I hit the hoe and record her
Rolley, rolley, that's a check
Birds singing, Keith Sweat
The world mine, the world mine
I got the sack and now I piss 'em off
Rich forever, I'm the boss
No neck, bitch? Got to can it
Jump in the house , itâ€™s abandonded
Diamonds bite, switching guard then I'm flexin on them
Ridin (?) too clean
Blue money, blue money
Forgien bitch countin' 50s and 20s
Band jumpin' like bungee

Liar, Liar, Liar, Liar

Flexing around, not a liar

[Verse 2]
Young nigga keep flexin'
I get a check with no question
The money ain't wastin a second
Rich nigga, you a peasant
Diamonds cut like a barber
Sit in the track, eat lobster
I bet she do it for the fame
Diamonds they boxin' like Suga Shane
Pockets filled with asparagus
Walk in the kitchen, experiment
Baby you know I got to go, I need that paper
Murder scene put chain cut like a shank
I told you I don't need help, I had to hustle myself
Everybody stop and they starin'
I think I might want a Mclaren
Overseas in Paris
The altar with money, we married
Look at my water, that's clarity
Verified like a parakeet (brrrppp)
Niggas askin' for a handout
I was really hustlin' in the street

Flexing around, not a liar
