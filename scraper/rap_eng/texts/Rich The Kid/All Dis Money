[Intro: Mango Foo]
All this money, got so much money
Money, money
All this money, got so much money

[Hook: Mango Foo]
All this money, got money, got money in the trap
All this money, got money, got money cause I rap
All this money, so much money, put it in the bag
All this money, got money, got these niggas mad
All this money, got so much money
All this money, got so much money
All this money, got so much money
All this money, got so much money
All this money, all this money
So much money

[Verse 1: Migo Bands]
All these dirty hundreds made the money counter jam
I ain’t got to count it cause a dollar weigh a gram
Nigga I got birds, I got birds, Trans-Ams
Young rich nigga catching serves out the Lamb
I’m sticking to the script, you get script if you get caught stealin'
I fell in love money, I done think I had no feelings
Count it up, count it up, looking at the calendar
I don’t know when I’m going out
Word on the street if the plug serve me then we ain’t seeing no drought

[Hook: Mango Foo]
All this money, got money, got money in the trap
All this money, got money, got money cause I rap
All this money, so much money, put it in the bag
All this money, got money, got these niggas mad
All this money, got so much money
All this money, got so much money
All this money, got so much money
All this money, got so much money
All this money, all this money
So much money

[Verse 2: Mango Foo]
Mango the fool, I’m draped up in jewels
I got paper like I’m in school
My diamonds they wet like a pool
You tryna take 'em, Fox 5, make the news
I got money like I work at a bank
OG gas bags all in the trap, got it stank
Got a knife on the end of the rifle, get shanked
Hit the water with the baking soda, fuck around and faint
Got a whole lot of money
Trapping and capping I don’t have a budget
Underarm kush got the whole club musty
Say your nigga real shooter but your gun clip rusty
I come from the dirty like rugby
Rode around, tryna call me Benny cause I been had hundreds
In the kitchen whipping like George Foreman
I bring it back like it’s karma
OKC the trap, we hit a nigga with the thunder

[Hook: Mango Foo]
All this money, got money, got money in the trap
All this money, got money, got money cause I rap
All this money, so much money, put it in the bag
All this money, got money, got these niggas mad
All this money, got so much money
All this money, got so much money
All this money, got so much money
All this money, got so much money
All this money, all this money
So much money

[Verse 3: Rich The Kid]
All this money, got too many hundreds
Only big fish and my bitch count twenties
Mango, go hit em with the K though
Fuck around and leave your brain gone
Big chase, big money
Bunch of our shoes cost 15 hundred
More chains, more ice
Might blind your bitch, that’s on my life
Young rich nigga from the bottom
Made it from the bricks, you know we got 'em
Hundred band cash on my robins
Call Migo Bands, hit 'em with the carbon
But your bitch can’t whip it like me
Ain’t talking bout Alicia, got Keys
Nigga I’d rather be rich than famous
Fuck your ho one night, bitch in Vegas

[Hook: Mango Foo]
All this money, got money, got money in the trap
All this money, got money, got money cause I rap
All this money, so much money, put it in the bag
All this money, got money, got these niggas mad
All this money, got so much money
All this money, got so much money
All this money, got so much money
All this money, got so much money
All this money, all this money
So much money
