[Hook: Quavo]
Meet me in the trap, I'm having pounds
Niggas having straps, don't come around
Niggas having all white, yeah, that step-down
Just hit me when you need me, I'll pull up on you right now (x2)

[Verse 1: Rich The Kid]
Bitch ride like six pack, break her like Kit-Kat
Ho fuck around, get kidnapped
Drown the bricks in the water, take a bird bath
All white diamonds like RiFF RAFF
Trap! Flippin' and breaking the packs, I got the catch in the back
Migo Jerz got the gas, no petrol, made a million dollars on the metro
Giving them hell, DJ Durel, watch the dope on the scale
Sippin' the lean, moving like snails, but I'm still wrappin' the bales belts
Clientele, clientele, bitch I've been running from twelve
Shipping the pounds in the mail, Migo Gang label cartel

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Offset]
Meet me in the bando, flippin' bricks like it's a sandal
Got a chopper, and it's camo, monkey nuts, a lot of ammo
I got more blow than a candle, get pulled up in Bugatti not no kiss
Migo Gang, we so ignorant, take your dope, take your flats and shit
Rolex my wrist blow a kiss, I might take your bitch for a hit
Look at my bitch, she British, Australian gator my fit
And when the pack in the town, we baggin' them up in them grounds
I've got O's, no nouns
Married to the money, took a vow

[Hook x2]
