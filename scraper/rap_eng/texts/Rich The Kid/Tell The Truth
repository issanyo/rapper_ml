[Intro]
Yeah
I spoke to my bro the other day
He told me niggas changing boy
You narsayyy

[Verse 1: Dirtbike LB]
How the fuck they leave us waitin'
Me and bro was patient
Learnt to whip at 14 shout out big homie no fake shit
Man he lost his savings
Married to the corner, I was married to the pavement
God gave me a chance, and I'll take it
I used to bag the whole box, it used to take me ages
I'm just going through these phases
If I pour another box, can you cop, are you sure?
We stay drippin' in Dior, YSL there you go (YSL there you go)
YSL I buy you more, all this money in my Goyard I can go and buy the store

[Chorus: Young Adz]
First things first
I can, really get a nigga hit with ease
I don't, need more drama I need more lean
She can, get a new bag maybe Céline
I'mma disappear like I'm Houdini

[Verse 2: Rich The Kid]
I can go and buy the store now
Bitches fuckin' in the road now
Bought a Roley it was bussdown
I'm in the Billy ain't no bus now
Switcharoo them bitches I can't cuff now
Fuck her in the mansion she get bust down
Vegan but she eat meat
Porsche I got the two seat
Ain't in love with Keke
Fuck her when she greet me
The bankroll on overload
I'm too rich I don't need you hoes
Got more ice than an eskimo
Got more checks than an envelope (Yuh!)
Makin' more than me I doubt it
Had to cut 'em off they doubted
I got a Bentley had to mount it
Too much money I can't count it (Rich!)

[Chorus: Young Adz]
First things first
I can, really get a nigga hit with ease
I don't, need more drama I need more lean
She can, get a new bag maybe Céline
I'mma disappear like I'm Houdini

[Verse 3: Young Adz]
I've had fed chases, court cases, niggas writing statements
20 crackheads in my alleyway I'm telling 'em, "be patient"
Took the other side to war
Selling crack got the whole UK on tour
I was so bummy wow but I'm getting money now
My fiend just asked me for a fix 'cause his nose is getting runny now
She just told me that's she's coming now
She my lady that's a thousand pound on shoes for her to run around

[Chorus: Young Adz]
First things first
I can, really get a nigga hit with ease
I don't, need more drama I need more lean
She can, get a new bag maybe Céline
I'mma disappear like I'm Houdini
