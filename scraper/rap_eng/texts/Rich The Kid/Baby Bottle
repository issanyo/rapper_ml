[Intro: Eurokid]
I just bought a pint, pass the baby bottle
I just bought a pint, pass the baby bottle

[Hook: Eurokid]
I just bought a pint, pass the baby bottle
We don’t drink liquor but we always poppin’ bottles
Foreign money gang, my belt is Ferragamo
Swagger on 100 so I only fuck with models
The kid is the truth, I pull up in coupe
I’m smoking the booth and sippin’ the lean
It’s killing my spleen, Balmain on my jeans
I’m counting these bands, and moving the grams, I need me a Benz
[?] my gang, [?] my gang, you must understand

[Verse 1: Eurokid]
Go get you a route, it’s never a drought, 9 5 down south
Cash out, I don’t need a bank account, I need a fucking stash house
You ain’t gettin’ no money, why you always looking bummy?
My diamonds always looking sunny
Screaming money in my pocket, and I always keep the rocket
And I shop at Neiman Marcus
What you know about Barney, and the cup full of Barney
Two cups full of purple, smoking on purple
You dressed like Urkel, don’t make me have to hurt you
Don’t make me turn up, I’ll make you turn down
We smoke out the pound, I’m the man of the town
Fuck boy move around, don’t fuck with no clowns
All I do is drink, my cup Easter pink, give a fuck what you think
My ice bling bling, your boy sing sing, pockets on ching ching
You niggas so fake, been getting this cake, hitting licks out of state
Whip whip, earthquake, make the fucking pot break
That’s how you get cake

[Hook: Eurokid]
I just bought a pint, pass the baby bottle

The kid is the truth, I pull up in coupe
I’m smoking the booth and sippin’ the lean
It’s killing my spleen, Balmain on my jeans
I’m counting these bands, and moving the grams, I need me a Benz
[?] my gang, [?] my gang, you must understand

[Verse 2: Rich The Kid]
Baby bottle, I got lean, pop a pint
Bitch I got the Act, I’m on the dirty Sprite
Mama keep tellin’ me put down that drank
I can’t even taste it, eat that Easter pink
I been on that purple, I can’t even think
I pulled up in Rari, made that ho, she faint
I drive the Benz and the Jag
I jugged the plug for the work
She got a brick in her skirt
Leanin’, I’m swervin’ the vert
I can buy the bitch new red bottoms
You see ‘em ‘round the block, young nigga then I head shot ‘em
I had to pull up Bugatti
Them diamonds came [?] safari
Sippin’ on drink, I’m on Marley
I’m on the drink and the bars
Still got the pints in the drought
You sippin’ on Quali’, we pouring it out
I’m fucking your bitch while you sleep on the couch
Put me in the kitchen, I’ma whip it up
More drank came in I’ma pour it up
Sippin’ on lean, I can never ever give it up
I’m rich!
