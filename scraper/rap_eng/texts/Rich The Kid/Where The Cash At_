[Verse 1: Rich The Kid]
Little nigga where the cash at?
I been chilling where the trap at
Bad bitch with a accent
She see em, where the racks at
They say I wouldn't, but I did that
I might pull up in a new Jag
Knew the money would change me
Look at my chains, my diamonds they wavy
Bitches they tried to play me, now these hoes asking for babies
My whole life changed all in one year
In the kitchen made a brick disappear
Lot of ice, whole block in my ear
It took a lot of hard work to get in here
Police they say they have evidence
Free my niggas, that's irreverent
Taking trips out to Beverly
God said I was heaven sent

[Hook: Rich The Kid]
Wake up and I gotta go get it
Rich nigga I done ran up a million
You can ask me how I did it
I'ma tell you go get it
I been counting up daily
Coupe going crazy
Looking at my diamonds they wavy
I knew that the money would change me

[Verse 2: Rich The Kid]
Still in the hood with a trap nigga, bitch wanna ride like a bicycle
Bitch I got rich and I'll never change
Came in this bitch with the Migos gang
I'ma make your ho do the dishes
High class trap nigga in the Fisker
Real shit, I'm living like Diddy
New York right now smoking cookies
Made a hunnid, when you see me I'm flexing
What the hell I ain't do no texting
In the field getting pints outside Texas
Sipping syrup in the morning, no breakfast
I heard they said I'm a superstar
All of my trap got them burglar bars
Came from the hood now I'm switching cars
Thanking the lord that I made it far

[Hook: Rich The Kid]
Wake up and I gotta go get it
Rich nigga I done ran up a million
You can ask how I did it
I'ma take over again
I been counting up daily
Coupe going crazy
Looking at my diamonds they wavy
I knew that the money would change me
