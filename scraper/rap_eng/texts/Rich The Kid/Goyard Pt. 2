[Hook: Rich The Kid]
I got a bank all of bags
She wanna fuck for a bag
I was in the trap fuck class
I had an A in math
I let the birds take a bath
Look at my finger the glass
I bought the bitch a new ass
Flexing around with the cash
Rollie watch, Goyard
Ain't lovin' these bitches, a cold heart
I needed a foreign to push start
Rollie watch, Goyard
Ain't lovin' these bitches, a cold heart
I needed a foreign, a push start

[Verse 1: Rich The Kid]
I need a brand new foreign
Rich forever get the money together
Bad bitch pullin' up with my cheddar
Strap on me like I had a Beretta
Killing niggas like I pulled out the shovel
Got a pint, double cup as a trunk
In the kitchen with the pot makin' bubble
Y'all niggas really really ain't trappin'
I was broke but made it happen
Brick disappearin' like magic
I left the trap with a broke wrist
Goyard, Paris
In love with the money we marry
She claim me and got embarrassed
You a rat like Tom and Jerry
Wet you up like a Squirtle
I be trappin', I  can serve you
I bought a watch and a new coup√©
Pull up to the party with no roof
I bought a brand new Glock
I bought a brand new drop
In the trap, in the spot
Real hot, flush the dope 12 hit the block

I got a bank all of bags
She wanna fuck for a bag

Look at my finger the glass
I bought the bitch a new ass
Flexing around with the cash
Rollie watch, Goyard
Ain't lovin' these bitches, a cold heart
I needed a foreign to push start
Rollie watch, Goyard
Ain't lovin' these bitches, a cold heart
I needed a foreign, a push start

[Verse 2: Famous Dex]
A fast car, go zoom
I used to sleep in my cousin room
I push the money with push broom
Run up on me my gun go boom
Look at me, I'm a star
I used to drive in a bogus car
Swear to god I can go far
Trick a lil' bitch send her right up to mars
Hard to kill call me Steven Seagal
Wait, used to sell drugs out my car
Yeah, used to do hits in my car
Wait, I'm off the flats, fuck the bars
Now I be balling like Kobe
My .30 on me you can't hold me
Hold up, hold up lil homie, wait
They calling me Dexter
Never leave home no Beretta, my 40 might get you
Bullets hit you like ketchup
And make you dance like Step Up
My diamonds they shine in the dark
Oh shit, in the dark
A 40 for the Goyard
A 5 for the Goyard, whaat?
