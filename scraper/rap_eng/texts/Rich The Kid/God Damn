[Hook: Rich The Kid]
Lotta motherfuckas hatin'
Ballin' mama said she proud of me
Whole gang gon' ride for me
Walkin' 'round with a knot
Can't trust your bitch she a thot
Spend a whole lot on a watch
Flexin' hard now they want me to stop
She in the coupe with no panties, god damn
I'm flexin', I'm flexin'
She in the coupe with no panties, god damn
I'm flexin', I'm flexin'

[Verse 1: Rich The Kid]
In the coupe with a model bitch and I'm fuckin' her cause she foreign
Rollie diamonds keep dancin' on me, still havin' Act so we pourin'
Money on me, fuck a bitch in my yeezys
Young nigga had to get it believe me
Diamonds on me, that's a whole lotta water
Rich forever, buy the masi' I flex
Hold up
That lil money that you got, it ain't nothin'
Broke rappers, where ya chain come from?
Bitch I done made at the mall

Old rapper with a rusty necklace
Pinky ring on water, the faucet
You was winnin', had the sauce, but you lost it
Now I'm winnin' and I'm flexin', they salty
