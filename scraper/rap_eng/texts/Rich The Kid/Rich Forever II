[Verse 1: Wy~lie]
I just pulled up in Atlanta
I ain't worried about the scammers
Pour a four inside a Fanta
And all my bitches they outstanding
I'm smoking gas that's out the function
I fuck my bitch inside the function
I ain't worried about nothin
I stack my bread I ain't bluffin
All these bitches wanna talk
I'm just tryna stack it up
Throw my money in the club
Make it back we fuck it up
Cocain rang rover
Pullin up four doors
Hopping out like woah
And I'm feelin so slow
All this lean gotta go
Smokin weed by the O
Me and Rich on the road

[Hook]
Freshin
Oh we finessing
And we rich forever
Got bitches far settle

[Verse 2: Rich The Kid]
I just pulled up Atlanta
Pour a four inside a Fanta
Money old like your grandma
Fuckin your bitch on a camera
Black and white print like a panda
Flippin network like a sandal
Play with my niggas we damage you
I gotta [?] that go shoot
Extra clips on the roof
Don't play with me I roll with the hammer
Put this dick in her mouth like bananas
[?]
Money got grey how you like nana
Bet she gonna lie to you
I fucked around and lost the roof
[?]
She suck it I give her the boot
Bet she gonna lie to you
At work she pull up at about 2
I hit her and pass to the crew
You kissing and calling her boo
And I hang with the killers like a [?]
Lean to much got juice
Ridin around the city in the coup
Can't fuck the bitch the pussy to loose

[Hook]
Freshin
Oh we finessing
And we rich forever
Got bitches far settle
