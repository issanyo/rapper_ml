[Intro: Offset & (Quavo)]
Huh
Take one shot
(Free the muthafuckin' savage man)
Dope
Boy
On the block
(Migo Gang nigga!)

[Hook: Offset]
Dope boy on the block tryna make a flip
I can't believe I got fame, look where I came, the 9 in my hip
When you geting money, you gon' change the way that you live
My bitch go both ways and I ain't trippin' on that bitch
Take one shot, take two shots (x6)

[Verse 1: Offset]
Offset!
Take one shot take two shots
We pullin' up in the brand new drops
Cuffing these bitches you niggas is cops
She suck me up but I don't eat the box
In the industry you get only one shot
We grindin' non stop and we not gonna flop
Your bitch she suck me up like a lollipop
Allergic to broke give me chicken pox
Ooooh sexy chocolate drop
Slow, sippin' Actavis at night
I keep the savages with me with pistols my nigga why not
You like the type of nigga I can beat with my hands with no eyes
If you ain't know 20,000 ain't enough
I can get you knocked off for a dime
I was so blind I had to do time
50,000 for my rhymes
20,000 for my uh uh
Quarter million for my Fisker
I'm workin' that bitch and you kiss her
Ooh smash her, dismiss her
I'm official, you niggas is unofficial
I'm a millionaire but I still keep the pistol
Come and take one shot and fuck with a nigga
Taking 2 shots you be fuckin' a nigga
I got out of jail and had plenty Benjis
Thank the lord for the vision and the mission he sent me

[Hook: Offset]
Dope boy on the block tryna make a flip
I can't believe I got fame, look where I came, the 9 in my hip

My bitch go both ways and I ain't trippin' on that bitch
Take one shot, take two shots (x6)

[Verse 2: Quavo]
Take one shot, take two shots
Came from the bottom to the tree top
Hit a fuck nigga with the re-rock
I used to trap out my Reeboks
Now these hoes lookin' so gorgeous
The Rollie you cannot afford it
I became very important
You want my dab, it cost a fortune
Never in a drought
That's 'cuz  I trap with them boards on the house
(And I'm havin'!) choppas under the mansion
(And I'm havin'!) money under the couch
When I make a play, they in and out
Walk in my trap hold yo' snout
When you wanna purchase get a large amount
Lotta millions all in my account
I do this shit for all of my rounds
Real niggas gonna keep it 100, real niggas gonna hold you down
I use to trap out the house(Trap out the back!)
Look at me now
We gettin' money now, ain't no playin' around
Play wit' my niggas, we pull up wit' sticks, 100 rounds

[Hook: Offset]

[Verse 3: Rich the Kid]
I'm Rich!
I was in the kitchen, had one pot
Bitch I mad a mil on one block
Trappin' all night at the Quik stop
Thank God I just pulled up in the drop top
I'm the number one muthafuckin' suspect
Fuck 12, tell them niggas free Offset
I was broke, now I'm walkin' with a dumb check
Bought ya bitch some Chanel, she was upset
And you know I don't fuck with the police
Fuck nigga, you don't really know me
One shot to the head and it's ov
In the trap and I started wit' a QP
One time, tell them niggas free Mango
Me and Martin hit a lick on the kickdoor
[?]bando
On the phone wit' the plug, he in Tokyo
Had to come up, so I stayed down
Me and Offset roll one pound
I was in the trap wit' the block hot
Had to serve a fuck nigga re-rock
One shot, Imma hit you wit' the beam on it
Turn your bitch over, Imma skeet on it
I hit her one time and I beat on it
She come home to you and you eat on it!
