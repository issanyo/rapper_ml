[Chorus: Rich The Kid]
I'm drinkin' medicine, I'm drinkin' medicine
Bitch, I'm drinkin' medicine
Double cup love, I'm drinkin' medicine
I'm drinkin' medicine (lean), bitch, I'm drinkin' medicine
Pour a four up, I'm drinkin' medicine (medicine)
I'm drinkin' medicine (dirty Sprite), bitch, I'm drinkin' medicine
Sprite in the club, I'm drinkin' medicine (medicine)
I'm drinkin' medicine, bitch, I'm drinkin' medicine

[Verse 1: Rich The Kid]
She said, "what's up with them cups?"
I say, "bitch, I'm drinkin' medicine"
I don't want no Goose, just bring some Sprite
I'm drinkin' medicine
I'm sicker than a bitch, so I gotta drink my medicine
Two white cups, Styrofoam is what I put it in
I'm leanin' like a broken chair, movin' like a turtle
Everything is movin' slow, but shit, it's how that's 'sposed to go
I'm stingy with my shit, you can't have none of my medicine
This that Actavis, man, I know ain't nothin' better than
That dirty Sprite, double cup, you leanin' too, then pour me up
I love my Sprite, it slow me up, think I should stop, don't give a fuck

[Chorus: Rich The Kid]
Double cup love, I'm drinkin' medicine
I'm drinkin' medicine (lean), bitch, I'm drinkin' medicine
Pour a four up, I'm drinkin' medicine (medicine)
I'm drinkin' medicine (dirty Sprite), bitch, I'm drinkin' medicine
Sprite in the club, I'm drinkin' medicine (medicine)
I'm drinkin' medicine, bitch, I'm drinkin' medicine

[Verse 2: Cap-1]
I'm on it
Yeah, I'm on it
I'm on that motherfuckin' medicine, AKA the Actavis
I guess that's why I act like this, got money in my mattresses
Don't pass me no vodka or no brown, I'm off that medicine
Sippin' on some sizzurp, I'm the pour up veteran
Got two cups and my two liter, that dirty Sprite, I'm sippin' on it
My niggas like it, my bitch want it, I pass it out, and we sippin' on it
Pourin' up on that G shit, your drink cut, that's remix
Doctor, give me that medicine, we poppin' seals, who better than
Drop 550 for the BT, hit you over the head fifty dollar zipper
You could come and get this red shit 'cause we drinkin' purple, so don't even trip
Hit the club, post in the VIP, pack of rillos, roll up a [?]
[?] chick, and she comin' with me
Duffle bag, we run the city, I'm gone

[Chorus: Rich The Kid]
Double cup love, I'm drinkin' medicine
I'm drinkin' medicine (lean), bitch, I'm drinkin' medicine
Pour a four up, I'm drinkin' medicine (medicine)
I'm drinkin' medicine (dirty Sprite), bitch, I'm drinkin' medicine
Sprite in the club, I'm drinkin' medicine (medicine)
I'm drinkin' medicine, bitch, I'm drinkin' medicine

[Verse 3: Dolla Boy]
Poppin' seals on the pint
Got my whole crew sippin' on the way to the top
My whole comin' with me, sittin' high on them sixes
On a straight money mission, niggas know how we get it
No slippin' in the trenches, get ya money, young nigga
Coupe look like a spaceship, we'll sit and sip like a chemo patient
Tryna fuck bitches, but I ain't the type to do no chasin'
And the work's all there, we don't do no fakin', no
Round of applause like I'm playin' b-ball
All doped up like I'm fresh out the ER
Southside dope boys we are
And we gettin' higher than a fiend dippin' blunts in the lean, shit

[Chorus: Rich The Kid]
Pour a four up, I'm drinkin' medicine (medicine)
I'm drinkin' medicine (dirty Sprite), bitch, I'm drinkin' medicine
Sprite in the club, I'm drinkin' medicine (medicine)
I'm drinkin' medicine, bitch, I'm drinkin' medicine
