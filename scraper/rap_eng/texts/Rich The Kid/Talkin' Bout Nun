[Hook: Rich The Kid]
You ain't talkin' bout racks, you ain't got no cash
You ain't talkin' bout whips, you ain't talkin' bout bets, you ain't talkin' bout Jags
You ain't talkin' bout loud, you ain't talkin' bout gas, you ain't talkin' bout strong
You ain't talkin' bout juugs, you ain't talkin' bout plays
Boy I'm so on, boy I'm so on
I can't live without it, ain't no way around it
You ain't got that sack, then you shouldn't talk about it
I can't live without it, ain't no way around it
You ain't got that sack, then you shouldn't talk about it

[Verse 1: Rich The Kid]
You ain't talkin' bout lean, you ain't talkin' bout Act
You ain't talkin' bout bales, you ain't talkin' bout bricks, you ain't talkin' bout packs
You ain't talkin' bout shit, I ain't never have shit, I ain't never been shit
Now I'm switching up whips with a red bad bitch, and she suck that dick, my wrist so sick
You ain't talkin' bout hoes, you ain't talkin' bout freaks
Moe, I fucked more hoes than you did last week
Make your baby mama leak
You ain't talkin' bout whips, you ain't talkin' bout cars
Boy I'm talkin' bout Planes
Boy I'm going insane in a brand new Range, ain't got no brain
Hit n run a A train, you ain't talkin' bout wrist, don't you see my ice?
Don't you see your bitch? Don't you see my whip? Don't you see my life?
I'm living so nice, AP on my wrist, cost me bout 50 thousand
All my niggas killers nigga, ain't no way around it

[Hook: Rich The Kid]
You ain't talkin' bout racks, you ain't got no cash
You ain't talkin' bout whips, you ain't talkin' bout bets, you ain't talkin' bout Jags
You ain't talkin' bout loud, you ain't talkin' bout gas, you ain't talkin' bout strong
You ain't talkin' bout juugs, you ain't talkin' bout plays
Boy I'm so on, boy I'm so on
I can't live without it, ain't no way around it
You ain't got that sack, then you shouldn't talk about it
I can't live without it, ain't no way around it
You ain't got that sack, then you shouldn't talk about it

[Verse 2: Rich The Kid]
Hit a 100 band juug, cash out on my neck
Young nigga got a check and you know I gotta flex, you ain't even got a sack, ima hit you with the tech
Brand new drop top Audi escort the roof
Freaky bitch from Strokers, I just nutted on her tooth
You ain't talkin' bout diamonds.. Don't you see me shining?
Hit the club and I'm blinding, seat reclining
And I'm poppin' them bottles, and I'm with them models
Ferragamo and Fendi, Truey, Louie and Bally
Young rich nigga, taking them trips to Cali
I'm sippin' I'm drinkin' I'm leanin' I'm fallin' my money is taller than buildings
I'm smokin' on kush and you smokin' on midget, I'm talkin' bout smaller than children
You ain't talkin' bout guns, you ain't talkin' bout drama..
You ain't talkin' bout M's, you ain't talkin' bout money, you ain't talkin' bout commas
You ain't talkin' bout shit

[Hook: Rich The Kid]
You ain't talkin' bout racks, you ain't got no cash
You ain't talkin' bout whips, you ain't talkin' bout bets, you ain't talkin' bout Jags
You ain't talkin' bout loud, you ain't talkin' bout gas, you ain't talkin' bout strong
You ain't talkin' bout juugs, you ain't talkin' bout plays
Boy I'm so on, boy I'm so on
I can't live without it, ain't no way around it
You ain't got that sack, then you shouldn't talk about it
I can't live without it, ain't no way around it
You ain't got that sack, then you shouldn't talk about it
