Grind hard, so I can't lose (nah)
Chase dreams, I don't chase bitches (nope)
Niggas talkin' like, "Trip different"
See the love, but I feel the hate
Money talkin', I don't talk for free
Young nigga comin' from the streets

Now I'm really tryna be a boss
And it hurt when you take a loss (loss)

So I'm gon' keep stuntin' (stuntin')
I know they hatin', but I'm just impatient

I sip lean, then pass out (I pass out)
I chase bread, that cash route
I break pounds, I hit licks (break pounds)
I live this, don't talk shit
You hatin' 'cause I'm 'bout mine
It's Bullyionair, and I'm gone Chi
Since a young boy, I'm a go-getter
I was really just tryna do better (yeah)
Said, "fuck school," and chased checks
'Cause nobody ever gave me shit (nah)
