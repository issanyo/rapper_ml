[Verse 2 : Rich The Kid]
I fucked your bitch in some new Chanel
Wasn’t in class I got saved by the bell
Too much heat like nacho new Rari I pull up with Guapo
Hit the dab one time, now they jackin
Bricks disappear what the fuck happened
Made a mil off rap still trapping
Walk around Rick Owens still dabbing
Look at the watch it’s my time had the I walk with a dime
I smashed your bitch and forgot about it I just got shot by the paparazzi
Flip like a gymnast she pop a molly
Rich The Kid on fire better tell somebody
Been in the trap make it work trappin it up got to work
She put the key in her purse I’m off the Xanny and Perc
I just came up from the dirt bitch got a strap in her skirt
Riding em out like Obama was broke I got too many commas
Got rich off a digital scale I just got a brick in the mail
