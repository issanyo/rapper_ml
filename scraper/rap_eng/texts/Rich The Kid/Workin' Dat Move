[Hook: Offset]
Fake watch buster can’t bust me, I ain’t working that move
Cuffing these bitches, I ain’t loving these bitches, you do it
Riding round the city, no pistol, I ain’t working that move
Telling on your partner, talking to the police, I ain’t doing it
I ain’t working that move, I ain’t working that move, I ain’t working that move
I ain’t working that move, I ain’t working that move, I ain’t working that move
I ain’t working that move, I ain’t working that move, I ain’t working that move
I ain’t working that move, I ain’t working that move, I ain’t working that move

[Verse 1: Rich The Kid]
Cuffing the bitch, ain’t working that move
Maison Margiellas, got dope on my shoes
I be riding round with a chopper, they ain’t working that move, I don’t know who shot ya
Flooded that AP, Rari goin’ crazy, traphouse jumping like KD
All these bitches and I’m trapping out the mansion
Counting up blue hundreds in the back of the phantom
From the bando to the billboard, real trap nigga, got keys like a landlord
Walking round no pistol, ain’t working that move
Ain’t playing no games, got shooters on the roof
Shmigo of the gang, got bodies
Motherfuck 12, free Bobby and Rowdy
Your watch fugazi getting them diamonds too cloudy
Ain’t working that move, might cost a Bugatti

[Hook: Offset]
Fake watch buster can’t bust me, I ain’t working that move
Cuffing these bitches, I ain’t loving these bitches, you do it
Riding round the city, no pistol, I ain’t working that move
Telling on your partner, talking to the police, I ain’t doing it
I ain’t working that move, I ain’t working that move, I ain’t working that move
I ain’t working that move, I ain’t working that move, I ain’t working that move
I ain’t working that move, I ain’t working that move, I ain’t working that move
I ain’t working that move, I ain’t working that move, I ain’t working that move

[Verse 2: Offset]
Flooded out Rolex, flexing like Boflex
Bitch looking so hard, bout to break her neck
Which one of you working, I ain’t gon’ fuck that
Used to be the nigga with the flat screens in the back
I am not working that move
Told on your partner, now he on the news
Look at you rocking all them fake ass jewels
VS diamonds in my Rolex like pools
9 millimeter, now he walking like a caterpillar
Money longer than a ruler, your money a centimeter
Crawling through your window like Roger, they call me Chiefer Creeper
Teach you little niggas a lesson, they call me Offset teacher
Birds in the fender bender, not talking bout chicken tenders
I got the ratchet in my jacket in the winter
I’m richer than a motherfucker, still a gang member
My niggas they animals and I do not tame niggas

[Hook: Offset]
Fake watch buster can’t bust me, I ain’t working that move
Cuffing these bitches, I ain’t loving these bitches, you do it
Riding round the city, no pistol, I ain’t working that move
Telling on your partner, talking to the police, I ain’t doing it
I ain’t working that move, I ain’t working that move, I ain’t working that move
I ain’t working that move, I ain’t working that move, I ain’t working that move
I ain’t working that move, I ain’t working that move, I ain’t working that move
I ain’t working that move, I ain’t working that move, I ain’t working that move

[Verse 3: Quavo]
Riding round hundred bands on me, nigga no strap, I ain’t working that one
Say you don’t like me when you see me, like Matt [?], we can get to clapping
I’m working the move, bitches whipping powder in my new factory
If 12 bust a move, nobody is snitching, the work is not ‘ttached to me
Woah, you better move, don’t be mistaken by my Loubotin shoes
I’m not a fool but I dropped out of school
I made a million on the avenue
Look at the critics, they want to ask me
Look at the bitches, they want to smash me
McJacking, dabbing, and I came from [?]
Power move, and we move out to a mansion

[Hook: Offset]
Fake watch buster can’t bust me, I ain’t working that move
Cuffing these bitches, I ain’t loving these bitches, you do it
Riding round the city, no pistol, I ain’t working that move
Telling on your partner, talking to the police, I ain’t doing it
I ain’t working that move, I ain’t working that move, I ain’t working that move
I ain’t working that move, I ain’t working that move, I ain’t working that move
I ain’t working that move, I ain’t working that move, I ain’t working that move
I ain’t working that move, I ain’t working that move, I ain’t working that move
