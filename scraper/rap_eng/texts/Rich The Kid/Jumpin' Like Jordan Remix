[Verse 1: Lil Durk]
Trap house jumpin' like Jeremy (Lin!)
Can't lend a bitch none of that money
Spend 20 at Saks, for sure I need racks
And the trap house jumpin' like Jordan
Savages, savages, savages
[?] off to a bitch, ain't havin' it
Hundred P's, I ain't talkin' 'bout whip
But I got a couple whips that we use for the traffickin'
A lotta gold, lotta guns, lotta 'Sace
[?] got everybody watchin'
Turn your bitch to a fan, now she startin'
[?] got the dope, smell rotten
Ugh, juug, molly water, juug, juug
I pull up like ugh, ugh, thinkin' I'm a bull, ugh
I think, ugh
In the trap, in the trap, in the trap
No rap, then it's back to the trap
Lean got a nigga want a nap
"This Ain't What You Want" got a nigga on the map
No seatbelt but a nigga stay strapped
[?] in the city, runnin' laps
One nighter, off a pull, gon' bite her
Fuck her, don't like her, 300 where it's at

[Hook: Rich The Kid]
Got the trap house like Jordan
Pull up in a brand new foreign
300 on the dash and I paid straight cash
Take off on you niggas Jeff Gordon
AP, it cost me 50
Model ho yeah she wit me
Livin' life like I'm Diddy
In the Kitchen with Whitney
Got the trap house jumpin' like Jordan
Trap house jumpin' like Jordan
Got the trap house jumpin' like Jordan
Trap house jumpin' like Jordan
AP, it cost me 50
Model ho yeah she wit me
Living life like I'm Diddy
In the Kitchen with Whitney

[Verse: 1 Quavo]
Trap house jumpin' like Jordan
J's in the hood they snorin'
Double cup lean I'm pourin'
Yo bitch whippin in the early mornin'
Pull up in the drop top Phantom
Niggas in the hood can't stand em
Whip game is so special
I'm whippin up the whole Grand Canyon
I got molly I got white, Marilyn Manson
I went to the jeweler cashed out on a new P now my diamonds dancing
Yo bitch think I'm romantic, my coke card game is frantic
My whip game make you panic, my plug is Phil Jackson
Feeling like Mutombo, I got all these Kush bowls
Juugin at the Texaco, you smoking on Reginald
Trap game Elvis Presley, you can't impress me
Dark skin ho can cook the dope, she look like Nestle

[Hook: Rich The Kid]

[Verse 2: Rich The Kid]
Got the trap house jumpin' like Kobe
Cashed out, hundred K on a Rollie
You ain't one of me, nigga, don't talk to me, nigga
I'm a real ass nigga, you phony
In the kitchen whippin' up them babies
Make the Pyrex trap go crazy
Young nigga got money, young nigga got work
Young nigga got crack like the 80s
I'm winnin', I'm winnin', I'm dunkin', I'm dunkin'
I'm Jordan, you're not even Kobe
In the kitchen with a Pyrex pot
Where the whippin' in the pot too hot
Drinkin' lean, out the bottle
In the Aston Martin foreign with a model
Twenty racks on me, got tats on me
In the bed with six hoes like two times three

[Hook: Rich The Kid]

[Verse 3: Takeoff]
Trap house jumpin' like Jordan
I’m a free man, no Morgan!
That choppa, it take out you organs
I play with them keys, no organ!
Your bitch in my kitchen, she snorting
The lean, I’m pouring, I'm snoring
I’m making them plays in Delaware
Versace, Medusa my underwear
Who the fuck, nigga better have haircare
You don't trap on the block if you dont live there
The trap be jumpin', and bunking, the fiends they running, the money keep comin'
I'm kicking hoes out like a punter, if i start shooting, turn to a track runner
I'm calling up Rich, he bringing the kids, Whipping the babies all summer

[Hook: Rich The Kid]
