[Hook]
Fifteen hundred for Margielas
I been flexin' diamonds wet I got em' jealous
Side bitch, give her no kiss
My niggas on some old shit
Gucci back pour a six
Rings on me like six
Fifteen hundred for Margielas
I been flexin' diamonds wet I got em' jealous
Side bitch, give her no kiss
My niggas on some old shit
Gucci back pour a six
Rings on me like six

[Verse]
Keep flexin' my diamonds bustin' Margielas homie they jealous
Bitch I might take her to Paris, money cut too scary
I got a check and they hate it, broke rappers in they feelings
Rich Forever got a label deal now I walk around with a few milli
I got your bitch in the comments, we do not go for the nonsense
Fuck around and go missin', Rich Sonny Liston
I was in school rebellious, teachers called me a failure
Now my bitch from Australia, diamonds dancing on la playa
Got a bitch get cut off, was a stripper but she laid off
Swervin' I'm getting topped off, big diamonds like golf balls
I was just poor, I had to sleep on the floor
Flexed up I'm the CEO, Fucked three hoes in a row
These niggas actin' like hoes

[Hook]
Fifteen hundred for Margielas
I been flexin' diamonds wet I got em' jealous
Side bitch give her no kiss
My niggas on some old shit
Gucci back pour a six
Rings on me like six
Fifteen hundred for Margielas
I been flexin' diamonds wet I got em' jealous
Side bitch, give her no kiss
My niggas on some old shit
Gucci back pour a six
Rings on me like six
