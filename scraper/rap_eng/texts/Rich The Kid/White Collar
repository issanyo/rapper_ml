[Verse 1 : Stak Da God]
Made a hundred bands off of white collar
And the streets jugging ducking importers
It ain't no ? fingers pussy I'll holla
Broski whipping flowers call it white collar
Niggas talking crazy but they never knew me
30 in the Glock and I just copped the Uzi
All these fucking clips you tryna shoot a movie
Poppin' like I'm Austin got me feeling groovy
Pulled up in a Panamera flexin' on 'em
With the weapon on 'em Smith & Wesson on 'em
That's for any nigga disrespecting on 'em
Make you ? that's a blessing on 'em
Made a hunned bands fuck a Uncle Sam
Never gave a fuck and still don't give a damn
Fill my plug Western Union money gram
Go and flex a couple pics on instagram
Niggas know I got whip so exotic
Bitch so exotic that's a double foreign
Get it state to state to state like I'm Torin
This balenciagas nigga fuck these jordans
She don't fuck with you cause you too fucking boring
Now I DMV I pee cause I'm important
Cop the Glock I see a opp you know I'm scorin'
Youngins kick your door in the early morning for that :

[Verse 2 : Rich The Kid]
Cappin' and trappin' I'm makin' the jugg
Worry I pull up my truck in the hood
Moved out the bando everything now good
Lean I'm trappin the sprite
Pull up and I got the actavis tight
Hit a hundred band jugg we made it
Young rich nigga in the coupe goin' crazy
I got the brick in the back though
The block is too hot like a candle
Flippin' the work like a sandal
Come to my spot I got white for low
Daddy called me a trap star
In the kitchen water whippin' rich gang gon' retail
I'm switching the cars
Rich nigga bought a maseratti and a black car
