[Intro:Rich Homie Quan]
I said, they thought that I went crazy 'cause that money came and
I said, they thought that I went crazy 'cause that money came and saved me
Now we shop in different places, no more clearing racks and Macy's

I, I say I'm worth a million

Young nigga, I'm next up (next)
Hit a club, I'm flexed up (flex)
