[Verse 1: Lil Uzi Vert]
Ya'll so clear you see through it
Gettin' money off stream music
So much Bape in my closet
She suck a real off G Unit
Hat on the head with a D on it
O with N with a C on it
If you talk drugs nigga we on it
Look at my ring put a key on it (trap)
Look at my car and a key on it
Look at my broad ain't no weave on it
You the type nigga that be on it
Can't even afford to breath on it
Yeah, I'm gettin' all this paper like whats up now
My chopper, chopper bigger than a damn truck now
Like uh, ring on check, chain on check
Ring on check, just three wings
Tell your bitch, I'm makin' money

She givin' me neck, yeah she next and then she next
Look at the chain up  on my neck it got all of those baguettes
Ha! Woo!

[Verse 2: Rich The Kid]
Rollie on my wrist that's a bust down
Diamonds on my wrist like I'm Chris Brown
Bitch, I don't even want to talk to you
Lil Uzi going to put you in the hospital
I was ten hittin' jewels on gold
Money so tall can't fold
Come to your house, kick in the door
Walking around with a bank roll
I done made a mil' in the trap house
Bad bitch but she got a good mouth
I do not kiss and we fuck on the couch
You cuffing I'm kicking em out
Bust down, Bust down, Bust down
Pinky ring, pinky ring, bust down, I'm sipping on Actavis now
Smoking OG by the pound, On a PJ for the Rico
My hoe is too foreign she closing the borders, illegal
Don't fuck with you people, it's QC the label
Bitch take a look at these chains
For the fame I'm still the same
In the kitchen I'm whipping that same thang
That Audemars 50k plain jane

[Hook: Lil Uzi Vert]
