[Intro: Rich The Kid]
Ayy, ayy

[Chorus: Rich The Kid & Ufo361]
Plug walk (plug walk, plug, plug)
I don't even understand how the fuck my plug talk (huh? what, what?)
Pick him up in a space coupe, I don't let my plug walk (ja, ihr wisst Bescheid, ja)
New freak, had to cut my other lil' bitch off (ja, Rich The Kid, ooh, ihr wisst Bescheid)
50K, you could come and book a nigga for a plug walk (jajaja)

[Verse 1: Ufo361]
Bin die Quelle in Berlin, ey (in Berlin)
Ey, Stay High, Money Team, ey (Stay High)
Ey, ruf die Bitches ins Maritim, ey (Maritim)
Zu viel Geld, ja, z채hl' es mit Maschin'n, ey
Ey, lass' die L채ufer laufen, so wie Forrest (skrrt, skrrt)
Ey, lass' die L채ufer renn'n, Fernando Torres (skrrt, skrrt)
Ey, alle drauf, Christoph Daum, ey
Meine Fresse taub, ja, zu viel Staub, ey
Stay High, Rich Forever, ey (Rich Forever)
Von jetzt an nur noch Steak auf meinem Teller, ey (jaja, skrrt, skrrt)
Ihr seid alles kleine Heuchler, Uri Geller (ihr wisst Bescheid, Ufo361)
Meine Roli gl채nzt, Dicka, wie die Schuhe von Cinderella, ey

[Chorus: Rich The Kid & Ufo361]
Plug walk (Stay High, plug, plug)
I don't even understand how the fuck my plug talk (huh? what, what?)
Pick him up in a space coupe, I don't let my plug walk (skrrt, pull up in a space coupe)
New freak, had to cut my other lil' bitch off (ooh, ooh, lil' bitch)
50K, you could come and book a nigga for a plug walk

[Verse 2: Rich The Kid]
You can't reach me (what?), space coupe like E.T
It's the plug tryna call me (skrrt, skrrt)
I was up trappin' early in the morning (plug)
Ooh, on the wave like a du-rag (du-rag)
Pussy nigga callin' for his boo back (pussy)
Plug walk, Gucci on my shoe racks (Gucci)
Walk up in the house, hit a rat-a-tat
'Til I ran into the plug ('til I ran into the plug)
'Til I ran into the mud (to the mud)
I done ran into some racks, I done ran into your girl (your girl)
Why the plug show me love? (Show me love)
I done came up from a dub (huh?)

[Chorus: Rich The Kid]
Ayy, plug walk (plug walk, plug, plug)
I don't even understand how the fuck my plug talk (huh? what, what?)
Pick him up in a space coupe, I don't let my plug walk (skrrt, pull up in a space coupe)
New freak, had to cut my other lil' bitch off (ooh, ooh, lil' bitch)
50K, you could come and book a nigga for a plug walk
