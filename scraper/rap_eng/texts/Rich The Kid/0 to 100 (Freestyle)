[Verse 1]
Fuck being on some chill shit
We go 0 to 100 nigga real quick
They be on that cuff and kiss a ho shit
I been married to the money in the trap bitch
Oh lord, know my worth, got it out the dirt
Bitches said I wouldn't make it pull up in a vert
Migo Jerz shippin' the birds
Skippa da flippa he choppin' the curb
These old rappers they get on my nerves
You cannot copy the words
Oh lord, went finnesin I'm a vet
Shoutout to yo bitch because she pull up with that wet
I cannot love her, how do you trust her?
I'm fuckin' yo bitch on top of the covers
She come with the rubbers
Niggas doubting, I'm still countin', I ain't worried bout it
Pocket rocket, keep it on me, go nowhere without it
Feels good to be rich, my life is the shit
I pull up in Bentley's with Soulja, Soulja
The Audemar dancing like nigga we made it
Trap still been jumpin', money still been comin'
I'm a fool with this shit boy
360 with that wrist boy
This that rich nigga shit boy
Trappin' trappin', turned into rappin', how did it happen?
The bricks they disappearing like magic
The racks in the matress
Oh lord, Rich The Kid ride a Rolls Royce
I'ma flex on y'all, I got no choice

[Hook]
I go 0 to 100, nigga real quick
Real quick, whole squad on that trap shit
0 to 100, nigga real quick
Real quick, real fuckin' quick 
I go 0 to 100, nigga real quick 
Real quick, QC on that real shit 
0 to 100, nigga real quick 
Real quick, Migo Gang on that trap shit
