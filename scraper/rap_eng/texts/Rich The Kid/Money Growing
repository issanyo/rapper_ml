[Verse 1: Dash Flash]
All of this money be growing
All of this money be going
All of this money be growing
Nigga you chillin' you wasting your time, what the fuck is you doin'
No time for chicks with emotions
Don't really love em' just fuck em' then send them emojis
Hearing you talking about me, with your homegirls but baby girl I'm just your homie
Now that I'm hot you just act like you know me
But girl I know that you been with my brodie
Don't even try to come up with a story
Not trying to hear it I know that you phony
Focused on money I'm destined for glory
They know I'm blessed, my flow is so holy
I score with your chick. And you try to block, I should call you a goalie
If any problems I talk to my OG
He getting hyped and he spazzin like Broly
Hit up the studio we got that codeine
We fifty deep none of us never lonely
Hit up the crib and I'm chillin' with shorty
She love my style and she kissing all on me
But back to the business
Because ain't nothing funny
I'm just getting that money. Aye!

[Verse 2: Rich The Kid]
All of this money be growing!
I got your bitch and she going
She bussin it open
Look at my wrist that's snow
Made me a millie off blow. What?!
I got the gas like a gas station
Made me a millie they hating
I got your bitch and she waiting
Fucking that ho we ain't dating
I got more buzz than a jam
The lean I move like a snail
White bricks are pale
A lot of white broke the scale
I got your ho and she nervous
Broke bitch want a Birkin
Fuck your ho now she squirting
Hit it once leave her hurting
Lot of racks like the bank though
Cooking dope in the safe though
Trapping gas need a elbow
Need a front I'm like hell no
Phone on one percent
One shoe pay your rent
Got a Masi now in debt
Still money well spent!!

[Verse 3: Dash Flash]
Getting this money I'm focused on hundreds
Drive past your block and you know that I'm Stuntin'
Stay with my niggas, this game we be running
Successful and blessed, is what I'm becoming
See your results and it seems you get nothing
Claim you make moves but you niggas be bluffing
Not even home, (Where's Dash at?!) but in my hometown I'm the one that these chicks they be loving
Never break bread with the fakes I'm reluctant
Walk in the room and there is no disruptions
Only the chicks they get quick to the touching
Walk in my city my music they bumping
Fact that they loving us
They fuck with us
They try to ride the wave and move up with us
Got chicks wearing Blessed shirts. Take one home, like Migos my nigga I pipe it up!!
