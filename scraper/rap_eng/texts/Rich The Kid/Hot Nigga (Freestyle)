Trap
Trap
Shout to Shmurda man
Hot nigga
Put your bitch up in the kitchen, get to trappin' ho
Trap
Put your bitch up in the kitchen, get to trappin' ho
Trap

[Verse 1]
Juuging for a check, I been a hot nigga
Police looking for me like I shot niggas
Gimme the loot, dropping the top on the roof
Skippa Da Flippa gon shoot
Been on the block, walking around with the knots
Moving the bags out the spot
Quavo with the K, that’s a hot nigga
Run up on us then you gon' die nigga
Got 100K on me right now nigga
Back then I was stealing them bicycles
Hot nigga, hot nigga, hurricane, hurricane, whip with the egg beater
All my young niggas trap, all my young niggas trap
Then you go and buy two seaters
Your bitch sucked me in the mouth, she damn near passed out
Throw 100 racks and I cash out and I mash out of that trap house
I’ll knock you out like Pacquiao
Blow your main bitch’s back out
She sucking me, you kissing her, you must be on that Bobby Brown

[Hook]
Put your bitch up in the kitchen, get to trapping ho
We got molly, we got white just like a napkin ho
Free my nigga Mango or we tweaking ho
Migo gang, 30 chains, pull up flexing dough

[Verse 2]
I been getting money since the first day
Look at the hate, was hungry but now the chef cooking the plate (Rolex)
My diamonds so deep, red bottoms my feet
Young nigga, I trap out a mansion, I’m sipping a whole lot of lean
I just went and bought a 'Rari bought a week ago
Had to hang up out the side and got to squeezing ho
Why you mad? Cause I’m rich and I ain’t broke no more
I got niggas that’ll shoot you like a video

[Hook]
Put your bitch up in the kitchen, get to trapping ho
We got molly, we got white just like a napkin ho
Free my nigga Mango or we tweaking ho
Migo gang, 30 chains, pull up flexing dough

[Outro]
Put your bitch up in the kitchen, get to trapping ho
