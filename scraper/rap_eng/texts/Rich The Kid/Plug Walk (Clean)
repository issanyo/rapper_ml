[Intro]
Ayy, ayy

[Chorus]
Plug walk (plug walk, plug, plug)
I don't even understand how the f*ck my plug talk (huh? what, what?)
Pick him up in a space coupe, I don't let my plug walk
(skrrt, pull up in a space coupe)
New freak, had to cut my other lil' b**ch off (ooh, ooh, lil' b**ch)
50K, you could come and book a n*gga for a plug walk

[Verse 1]
You can't reach me (what?), space coupe like E.T
It's the plug tryna call me (skrrt, skrrt)
I was up trappin' early in the morning (plug)
Ooh, on the wave like a du-rag (du-rag)
P*ssy n*gga callin' for his boo back (p*ssy)
Plug walk, Gucci on my shoe racks (Gucci)
Walk up in the house, hit a rat-a-tat
'Til I ran into the plug ('til I ran into the plug)
'Til I ran into the mud (to the mud)
I done ran into some racks, I done ran into your girl (your girl)
Why the plug show me love? (Show me love)
I done came up from a dub (huh?)

[Chorus]
Plug walk (plug walk, plug, plug)
I don't even understand how the f*ck my plug talk (huh? what, what?)
Pick him up in a space coupe, I don't let my plug walk (skrrt, pull up in a space coupe)
New freak, had to cut my other lil' b*tch off (ooh, ooh, lil' b*tch)
50K, you could come and book a n*gga for a plug walk

[Verse 2]
Big ol' Bentley, it's a spaceship (whoa)
Call me on my phone, I don't say shit (what?)
I make money when I talk (when I talk)
I'm a boss, take a loss (I'm a what?)
I could introduce you to the plug (to the plug)
B*tch, this ain't no Henny in my cup (lil' b*tch)
Stayed down, now the racks up (racks up)
She gon' let me fuck, *ss up (*ss up)
Plug
I stuck kis in the Louis V (Louis V)
F*ck 12, Iâ€™m a G, ain't no stoppin' me (ain't no stoppin' me)
And my wrist is on overseas (drip)
R*ch n*gga, you can't talk to me (rich)

[Chorus]
Ayy, plug walk (plug walk, plug, plug)
I don't even understand how the f*ck my plug talk (huh? what, what?)
Pick him up in a space coupe, I don't let my plug walk (skrrt, pull up in a space coupe)
New freak, had to cut my other lil' b*tch off (ooh, ooh, lil' b*tch)
50K, you could come and book a n*gga for a plug walk
