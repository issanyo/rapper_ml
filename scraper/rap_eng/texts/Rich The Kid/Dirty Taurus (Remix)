[Intro: Ant Beale & Rich the Kid]
Ayy (Gih), yah, ayy
I used to whip a dirty Taurus, it said wash me on the back (Woah, woah, woah, woah, yeah)
We used to whip a dirty Taurus (Whip a, whip a dirty Taurus), it said wash me on the back
Ayy, ayy
Good-good-good-good Work Charlie

[Bridge: Ant Beale]
We used to whip a dirty Taurus, it said wash me on the back
Now I hop up on the plane and take it to L.A. and back
I just be vibin' with the team cause I know they got my back (Yeah, aayy, yeah)
I'm just vibin' with the team cause I know they got my back

[Verse 1: Ant Beale]
They be like "Ant Beale, all he do is pop shit"
Seen him out in Cali' he was chillin' with a pop bitch
Then I turned around and seen him drivin' in his mom whip (Skrrt, skrrt, skrrt)
They all love to talk about the kid cause they ain't got shit
They ain't never seen shit (Seen shit), less they seen me out in Calabasas with a scene bitch
Smelling like some Dolce & Gabbana mixed with lean sip (Lean)
And a little green shit (Green)
Fuck that shit they talk about cause it don't ever mean shit
It's like the moral of the story is I grow and get bigger
We got the Goose and lemonade tonight cause he bought the liquor
Ya WCW just followed my Twitter
And I know you really like her so I'm tryna get with her

[Chorus: Ant Beale & Rich the Kid]
I need them VVS' on my ring too
I need a singing bitch I can sing to
I need someone to ask me why I get so high
Need the trunk shaking when I ride by
You know the hate is the new love
They get close to us just to use us
But I'ma keep turnin' up too much
Fuck the club up so bad they try to sue us (Ayy)

[Bridge: Ant Beale & Rich The Kid]
We used to whip a dirty Taurus (Ayy), it said wash me on the back (Yeah)
Now I hop up on the plane and take it to L.A. and back
I just be vibin' with the team cause I know they got my back (Woah, woah, woah, woah, ayy)
I'm just vibin' with the team cause I know they got my back
We used to whip a dirty Taurus, it said wash me on the back (Ayy)
Now I hop up on the plane and take it to L.A. and back
I just be vibin' with the team cause I know they got my back
(Whip a, whip a dirty Taurus)
I'm just vibin' with the team cause I know they got my back (Ayy)

[Verse 2: Rich The Kid]
Whippin' a Taurus
That shit was just Louie, I used to wear Forces
Up at ten thirty (Thirty), bitches want a Birken (Bitch)
Shawty tryna run it up, she twerkin' (Twerkin')
Can't talk on the phone with the plug 'cause they heard it (Plug)
I hit a jugg (Jugg), I had to hustle, got it out the mud (Whoa)
They said I wouldn't do it (Do it)
Look at the Rollie, the diamonds go stupid
Birds take a bath (Bath), I'ma do the dash (Yerr)
Ain't cuffin' the bitch 'cause she bad
Straight to the kitchen, I do the math (Whip)
I'ma slap her on her ass (Ass)
This a Rari, not a Jag (Whoa)
Goyard, not Lacoste ('Coste)
Real boss take a loss (A boss)
She just boujee, cut her off (Huh?)
Drop the top and get lost (Yeah)

[Verse 3: Ant Beale]
They got evil intentions, I could see right through it
I won't need me no pension, bitch I get right to it
Bet they wanted me dead, once the kid got ahead
I could ride in they bed and grab they bitch by the head, woah (Woah)
I'm the boy she told you not to worry 'bout (Worry 'bout)
She told you she was going to her auntie house (Her auntie house)
She called the Uber Black to the studio
Yeay, we made a movie woah
