[Intro: Charlotte Devaney]
You can put it on a plate
Eat it any way

Come get ya five a day
You can put it on a plate
Eat it any way
When its ripe and ready
Come get ya five a day

Hit it hit it can you say that you did it
Get it fresh out the kitchen

Get it fresh like a lemon
H-h-hot like a pepper

[Pre-Chorus: Charlotte Devaney]
Put it all in ya mouth
Chew it up spit it out
Watch it shake shake shake shake
As i put it down
Send it up to the clouds

Got me bounce bounce bounce bounce bouncin' the ground
Put it all in ya mouth
Chew it up spit it out
