[Intro]
Eye, caught my eye
Baby, you caught my eye
Caught my eye

[Hook]
Baby girl, I ain’t a fool for love, you caught my eye
When we first met we was just chillin', fuckin', gettin' high
But now I love you girl
I really need you girl
Fussin', fuckin' we was fightin'
Baby girl just ride it
She call me daddy when I’m inside her
Pull out my dick and she get excited
You was hurt to see my phone hoes textin' me
But I don’t need them other bitches
Only you and me

[Verse 1]
Baby girl I ain’t just playin'
I really need you
I was tourin' on the road
Came home to see you
Thank you God for my soulmate
I told you that we gon' be straight
No chance it was fake
Got outta jail beat the case
Now we ridin' round the hills out in Hollywood
Told your momma you with me
And we gon' be good
Diamonds all in your ring
I'mma show you what I mean
Now we onto better things
Forever you and me
Niggas hatin' they bitches
My fans tryna take pictures
Changing my life to be with you
Come home beat the pussy
Baby smell like Versace
Neck good, extra sloppy
Right here cause you got me
I'mma buy you a Masi

[Verse 2]
I'mma fuck you like I love you
Baby girl you my world
You feeling like I was wrong
Even though we made it this long
Chef in the kitchen, she cook for me
Now we living how we suppose to be
I told my momma you mine
The only thing on my mind
And you can do just what you want girl, I support you
And I will never ever forget what we been through
We done made it through the winter

Take you home you in trouble
Bathtub with the bubbles

I got to thank God cause God made you perfect
Forever always
I just wanna fuck you like all day
