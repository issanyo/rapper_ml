[Intro: Hoodrich Pablo Juan]
Yeah, Pablo Juan, man
You know what the fuck going on, nigga
Just came back from Africa, nigga
Straight out the plane, nigga, jumped straight in the 'Rari, nigga

[Chorus: Hoodrich Pablo Juan]
My diamonds, they splash
VS 1 stones, they look fantastic
You can see them hitting through the tint in the Aston
Twenty on the pinky ring, got me advancing
Bust down the Rollie, too many adjustments
I should just put all this ice in a Fanta
Froze like the North Pole, bag like Santa
Walk in this bitch and I'm lit like a candle
Oooh, look at them diamonds dance
Look at them diamonds dance
Look at them diamonds dance
Look at them diamonds dance
Oooh, look at them diamonds dance
Look how them diamonds dance
Look how them diamonds dance
Look how them diamonds dance

[Verse 1: Hoodrich Pablo Juan]
Oooh, they dancing
Oooh, look how they splashing
Them diamonds ain't real, they plastic
I put VS 1 stones in my Cartier glasses
Them diamonds, they looking fantastic
They see me, they getting embarrassed
I bounce through the trap like a rabbit
I'm having the cabbage and carrots
Touched down the plane, got a jeweler from Africa
The flaws on my diamond, they looking spectacular
Subzero, nigga cold like Alaska
Run up on my diamond, nigga, I'ma blast you
Bought a Rollie, come from cashing the bricks
Bought a Bentley, blinded myself and I crashed it
Too many diamonds, these niggas embarrassed
Bought myself a ring, me and money got married

[Chorus: Hoodrich Pablo Juan]
My diamonds, they splash
VS 1 stones, they look fantastic
You can see them hitting through the tint in the Aston
Twenty on the pinky ring, got me advancing
Bust down the Rollie, too many adjustments
I should just put all this ice in a Fanta
Froze like the North Pole, bag like Santa
Walk in this bitch and I'm lit like a candle
Oooh, look at them diamonds dance
Look at them diamonds dance
Look at them diamonds dance
Look at them diamonds dance
Oooh, look at them diamonds dance
Look how them diamonds dance
Look how them diamonds dance
Look how them diamonds dance

[Verse 2: Famous Dex]
Look how them diamonds dancing
I'm selling white, Henny, and Hansen
Sipping on lean, I can't stand
And fuck your little bitch, take her shoes off her right here in my mansion
Look how them diamonds bling
Look at them diamonds, my ring
Little boy, you ain't on a thing
Pablo, bring the chopper out, spray the thing
Wait, I used to trap with my cousin
Now I get them by the dozen
Rozay got the trap bunking
Don't knock on my door 'cause my auntie, she dumping
My diamonds, they dancing
I got a little bitch, man, her head is fantastic
Swear to God, this bitch know magic
I swear to God, this bitch know magic, whoa, Dexter!

[Chorus: Hoodrich Pablo Juan]
My diamonds, they splash
VS 1 stones, they look fantastic
You can see them hitting through the tint in the Aston
Twenty on the pinky ring, got me advancing
Bust down the Rollie, too many adjustments
I should just put all this ice in a Fanta
Froze like the North Pole, bag like Santa
Walk in this bitch and I'm lit like a candle
Oooh, look at them diamonds dance
Look at them diamonds dance
Look at them diamonds dance
Look at them diamonds dance
Oooh, look at them diamonds dance
Look how them diamonds dance
Look how them diamonds dance
Look how them diamonds dance

[Verse 3: Rich The Kid]
Diamonds on me dancing like a real deal stripper
Bust in her mouth, you a fool if you kiss her
Diamonds on me dancing like Chris Brown
You said I wouldn't make it, well, bitch, I'm the shit now
Little bitch, sit down
Kicking in your trap with the chopper, better get down
Hoodrich Pablo on the jet with a whole pound
Young rich nigga, money long like a Greyhound
Blue money on me like the wave, too
Fell in love with the Lamb, had to buy two
Oooh, look how them diamonds dance
Flexing on them, hundred racks in my pants
Rings on me, that's water
Rich nigga, I was riding in the MARTA
Diamonds on me and they cut like a barber
I'm flexing on them in a 'Rari, no charger

[Chorus: Hoodrich Pablo Juan]
My diamonds, they splash
VS 1 stones, they look fantastic
You can see them hitting through the tint in the Aston
Twenty on the pinky ring, got me advancing
Bust down the Rollie, too many adjustments
I should just put all this ice in a Fanta
Froze like the North Pole, bag like Santa
Walk in this bitch and I'm lit like a candle
Oooh, look at them diamonds dance
Look at them diamonds dance
Look at them diamonds dance
Look at them diamonds dance
Oooh, look at them diamonds dance
Look how them diamonds dance
Look how them diamonds dance
Look how them diamonds dance
