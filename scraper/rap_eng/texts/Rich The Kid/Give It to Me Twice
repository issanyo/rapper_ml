[Verse 1]
Baby girl, see you cross the floor looking wonderful
And I wanna know what it's gonna take to make you stay with me
'Cause I want that and I need that
I can give it to you, baby, just believe that
Get to know me, come in closely and let it all go down

[Hook]
Hands in the air, baby girl, get wet
Hands in the air every time you step
Hands in the air like we up in a rave
Hands in the air, yeah, you [?] up the place
Hardy we party till we see the sunrise
Felt so good the first time, getting even tonight
Give it to me twice
Give it to me twice
Give it to me twice

[Verse 2]
If she fine, I'mma give it to her two times
Maserati while you riding in a Nissan
Ain't it cool? I got two chickies
Two rollies only cost two-fifty
Two chains on, cost a whole lot
[?] shots, still cappin' I got two traps
Baby, put it in the air, yeah
Smoking two (hey) got me high as hell
On a jet, I got two of 'em
Two brought two, have a foursome
Got your girl, she gettin' old like a rework
Mama told me two times [?] threesome

[Hook]
Hands in the air, baby girl, get wet
Hands in the air every time you step
Hands in the air like we up in a rave
Hands in the air, yeah, you mash up di place
Hardy we party, till we see the sunrise
Felt so good the first time, getting even tonight
Give it to me twice
Give it to me twice
Give it to me twice
Give it to me twice
