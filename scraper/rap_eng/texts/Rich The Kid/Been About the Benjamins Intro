[Verse]
Rolex, wrist on chill
Turn my dream to my life, now this shit so real
Cash money, I got cash money
Birdman fly, but I ain't with Cash Money
I got two bad freaks, and they goin' both ways
Eyes real low, I ain't slept in four days
Money on the table, money on the floor
Keep a .40 cal on me like ten times four
Black diamonds, so you know they come in black, boy
Not Yo Gotti, but I got the sack, boy
And I'm runnin' with them jackboys
Everybody got a strap, boy
If I catch your bitch in the club
She leave with me, you don't get no love
If I catch your bitch in the club
She leave with me, you don't get no love
Cash money, I got cash money
Birdman fly, but I ain't with Cash Money
Cash money, I got cash money
Birdman fly, but I ain't with Cash Money
Cash money, I got cash money
Birdman fly, but I ain't with Cash Money
Cash money, I got cash money
Birdman fly, but I ain't with Cash Money
