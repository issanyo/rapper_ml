[Hook: Rich the Kid]
Said she wanna do it for a bankroll
Pull out the chop at the back though
Ain't tryna see your clothes on no more
Baby just do it for a bankroll
Said she wanna do it for a bankroll
Pull out the chop at the back though
Ain't tryna see your clothes on no more
Baby just do it for the bankroll

[Verse 1: Cadre]
Dollar bills and rubber bands
Alcohol in my other hand
Her man left, I came through the window like "brother man, I'm the other man"
Mix drinks with a mix bitch
Teach yo somethin', this pimp shit
See my clothes, that's rich shit
Fine 9, that's slim dick
Booty shackin', thighs jigglin', titties bouncin' at the same time
I got the car running outside, I break yo off from your break-time
That bassline, make 'em get low, like Diplo and 6 Fo's
Rich ho's, rich ho's, my striphouse is rich ho's
She said it came to the club in a wheelchair, cuz that bitch broke (I said "ah!")
She said it came to the club in a wheelchair, cuz that bitch broke
Okay big face and your waist band
Take a chance or just real nigga
You tired of her? Well get some money, and your ass won't had to deal with her

[Verse 2: Cadre]
Yeah I been workin' all three shifts, that's how all the hustlers get rich, yeah
All thright, as my wrist
66 with this shit, yeah
Never ran from no block C
Damn B, the type of niggas get caught and talk to the judge
I got that loud in, that's hang time, blowing smoke at the K-9
New fit, fresh look, ho's on me like West-Brook
Ho's on my like too short, lanes never get good points
Wild party in the Beverly Hills, house probably cost 70 mil
Born broke, I won't die broke
Real shit, real shit
I said I'm born broke, I won't die broke
Real shit, real shit
Said all that gaz had just made us famous
Booty big because she got a trainer
Bankrolls like Pablo, fuck me right and get a condo
