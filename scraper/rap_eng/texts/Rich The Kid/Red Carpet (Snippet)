[Lyrics from Snippet]

[Hook: Rich The Kid]
I'm a boss I might flex on a bitch (yeah yeah yeah)
I ain't lyin' spent a grip on my wrist
If she bad I might take her to the Red Carpet
Foreign car now I'm tryna ?
I'm a boss I might flex on a bitch
I ain't lyin' spent a on my wrist
If she bad I might take her to the Red Carpet

[Bridge]
Popped up, hit it and I slide
Ten bands up , do you ride
When I got that money I ain't change up
Bet she know my name I got paper

[Hook: Rich The Kid]
I'm a boss I might flex on a bitch
I ain't lyin', spent a grip on my wrist
If she bad I might take her to the Red Carpet
Foreign car now I'm tryna ?
I'm a boss I might flex on a bitch
I ain't lyin' spent a on my wrist
If she bad I might take her to the Red Carpet

[Bridge]
Popped up, hit it and I slide
Ten bands up , do you ride
When I got that money I ain't change up
Bet she know my name I got paper


[Verse: Rich The Kid]
Do she know my name, do she know my name
Rich Forever, put that on my chain
Why y'all mad wheres y'all petty cash
Salty ? thats a ten piece
Woke up with a bankroll today
