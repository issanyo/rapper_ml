[Intro: Rich The Kid]
Trappin' and dabbin'
Bitch, I been cappin'
Droppin' the top on the [?]
I got the gas in the back of the 'Rari
Why they keep askin' for molly?
Trap

Sonny Digital
Whoo

[Chorus: iLoveMakonnen & Rich The Kid]
I got the gas (trap) and the coke
I don't sell molly (molly) no more (whoo)
I keep the white and the green (white)
And it gotta be a pint (trap) if you looking for the lean (lean)
I got the gas (trap) and the coke (gas)
I don't sell molly (molly) no more (whoo)
I keep the white (trap) and the green
And it gotta be a pint (gas) if you looking for the lean (trap)

[Verse: Rich The Kid]
Trappin' and dabbin'
Bitch, I been cappin'
Droppin' the top on the [?]
I got the gas in the back of the 'Rari
Why they keep askin' for molly? (molly)
Got two foreign hoes, they kissin'
Codeine sippin' (lean), molly got lost in the Bentley (in the Bentley)
Walk in the trap (trap)
Remix, re-rock, you can't get no straight drop (bitch)
Fly with the wrist
Stand in the kitchen, I'm breakin' my wrist (breakin' my wrist)
Finally rich (whoo)
Servin' the block, and I'm stuntin' the brick (I get the brick)
Heard you was snitchin' (what), talkin' to the five-o (twelve)
I got the gas, but I don't sell molly no more (rich)

[Chorus: iLoveMakonnen]
I got the gas and the coke
I don't sell molly no more
I keep the white and the green
And it gotta be a pint if you looking for the lean
I got the gas (uh) and the coke (uh)
I don't sell molly no more
I keep the white and the green
And it gotta be a pint if you looking for the lean
