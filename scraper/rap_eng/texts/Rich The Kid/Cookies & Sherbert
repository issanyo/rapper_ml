[Intro: Rich The Kid]
Yah, yah, huh

[Chorus: Rich The Kid]
I'm mixing them cookies with sherbert (lean)

Young nigga hop out the vert (yuh)

I might pop a perc, I might make it work (huh)

[Verse 1: Rich The Kid]
Pop me a perc now I'm geeking
Hop out the Maybach I'm sleepy (bitch)

Back in the bando a minute
Pot too hot need a mitten (hot)

Counting up 150 (hunnid)
I was dreaming bout a Bentley (woah)
Niggas broke pockets empty (broke)
Fuck is you saying dog?

Over watch stick the dick in her mouth
Diamonds on me straight knocking you out
Ran off with the plug money
Running through it we blowing money
Can't trust a bitch might turn on you
Take your hoe and I swerve on you (skrt)

Pull out I bust on her boobies (huh)
She sucking me don't want the coochie

[Chorus: Rich The Kid]
I'm mixing them cookies with sherbert (lean)

Pulling up right in that two seater (skrt skrt skrt skrt skrt)
Soak it up just like a mop (soak it up)
