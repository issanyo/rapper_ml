[Intro: Rich the Kid, Austin]
Ooh, I got the keys, baby
Ride with me baby (It's PRETTYMUCH)
The Billy the B (yuh, yuh, yuh)
They ain't richer than me baby

[Chorus: PRETTYMUCH]
Hola, mami (hola)
You got me losin' focus (yeah!)
Got what you need
And you don't even know it
Lost and solita (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Lost and solita (yah)

[Verse 1: Brandon & Edwin]
Girl I know why you came out tonight
So shake it off
Whatever's been sitting on your mind
I'll take it off
We can dance the night away (yeah)
Fallin' for you like the rain (rain)
Don't you worry 'bout a thing (woo)
Don't you worry 'bout a thing (yeah)

[Pre-Chorus: Zion & Nick]
Where you at, where you at
Girl it's all on you
Take my hand, take my hand
Put a smile on you (yeah)
I know that you wanna dance
I know that you scared of love
But if you give me the chance
You know that I'll be the one

[Chorus: PRETTYMUCH]
Hola, mami
You got me losin' focus
Got what you need (you need)
And you don't even know it (know it)
Lost and solita (solita)
I found you
Lost and solita (sola, sola, sola)

[Verse 2: Nick, Zion]
I swear I ain't tryna rush you, girl
I'll wait for that (I'll wait)
The moment I get to touch you, girl
I'll pray for that
Like ooh
Nobody up in here is looking as good as you do (as good as you)
I promise you Mami, it's true

[Pre-Chorus: Zion & Brandon]
Where you at, where you at
Girl it's all on you
Take my hand, take my hand
Put a smile on you
I know that you wanna dance
I know that you scared of love
But if you give me a chance
You know that I'll be the one

[Chorus: PRETTYMUCH]
Hola, mami (yeah)
You got me losin' focus
Got what you need
And you don't even know it
Lost and solita (yeah, yeah)
I found you
Lost and solita (solita-aaa)

[Verse 3: Rich The Kid]
She gon' drink with me on an island (yup)
Pull out the 'Rari I'm wildin' (skuur)
She's so bad, she gon' shine like a diamond (like a diamond)
I got money, throw it up, change the climate (freeze)
And that ass too fat, get behind it
And a - too good, I rewind it (I rewind it)
Rocks in her watch like shots (like shots)
Need to pull up on a yacht for the blocks (freeze)

[Chorus: PRETTYMUCH, Edwin]
Hola, mami (mami, yeah)
You got me losing focus (losing)
Got what you need
And you don't even know it
Lost and solita
I found you
Lost and solita (I found you, yeah)
Hola, mami
You think I didn't notice
You got dressed up
And you deserve to show it
Lost and solita
I found you
Lost and solita (solita-a)

[Outro: Rich the Kid, Brandon, Austin]
Hola, mami
She gon' drink with me
We gon' sip 'for free
She as boujee as she can be
Hm-mm
Yo, it's PRETTYMUCH
