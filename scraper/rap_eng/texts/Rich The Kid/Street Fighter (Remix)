[Key!: Verse 1]
Raf Simons when I walk in bitches gon' remember this
All this fucking money I'm throwing bitches can't get none of it
I just brought your bitch to the trap house
Okay, we fucking in that bitch like it ain't no trap house
Okay, police can come at any fucking time
Okay, but she don't care she just wanna lose her mind
Okay, its fat man Key I wrote the game
Okay, its fat man Key I took your chain
Okay, I'm humble for the Bentley, not a name
Okay, I'm ballin' like I went to Notre Dame
All this shit we been through, I think we deserve it
I fuck up the fefe on purpose

[Verse 2: Rich The Kid]
Fuckin' your bitch then I leave her
Rich nigga trap off a beeper
More chains than a slave
Sippin' lean in the lemonade
Now they fuckin' on the couch
I'mma put it in her mouth
Ran off on the plug
Choppa ridin' with the glove
Might take a hoe to the trap house
She suck the dick then I kick her out
Balmain got a 50 on me
Hit a bitch with the switcharoo
You a lame tried to cuff her
She a freak, bring the rubbers
Givenchy, 3 racks on the sneakers
I'm ballin', you sit on the bleachers
Would you cop a quarter milli on a chain?
And I've been wantin' to be rich, but fuck the fame
Gotta get it on the bible
Street Fighter, it's survival
I'mma pull up in a sports car
Fuckin' this bitch, she a pornstar

[Hook: Key!]
