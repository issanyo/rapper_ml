Pull up in Bugatti
My bitch from safari
I'm sleeping, I'm running the lobby
Pull up in Bugatti
My bitch from safari
I'm sleeping, I'm running the lobby
Maison Margiela umbrella
Rich nigga I'm chasing, the weather got bricks in the flexer
Pull up in Bugatti
My bitch from safari
I'm sleeping, I'm running the lobby
Pull up in Bugatti
My bitch from safari
I'm sleeping, I'm running the lobby
Maison Margiela umbrella
Rich nigga I'm chasing, the weather got bricks in the flexer

[Verse 1: Selfmade Espy]
I'm checking and switching the climate
Cuban link with the diamonds
They think I'm mad that I'm rhyming
8 p perfect timing
I told my hoe know it's trap eyes
I may finesse you with juug eyes
I may finesse you with juug eyes
Club my kitchen that's cook eyes
I run to the spinach like Popeye
I ain't got no rule so I hop out
They stick on me, stick on me, stick on me
I know they seek on me, seek on me
My bitch run , she ain't got no cut on her
Giuseppe's they naughty, it's hugging
I think about cash while I'm fucking her

[Verse 2: Pablo Juan]
Play with the keys, piano man
Too much money call me Tilly Mann
Popped the molly, perc, and the xan
My nigga from the DC come get the tag
Run the check nigga, Peter Pan
What the fuck you know about a kilo gram
Little nigga I'm the cheeky man
Licking my wrist then I jump in the pan
Stay with the chopper like I'm from Iran
Boy I had a plug, I had a plan
Take a nigga shit, call up my man
Chop a brick up with my bare hands
[?] call up the plug [?]
Dirty Harry 238 twins
Wreck the Beamer, went and bought me a Benz
Diamonds in my watch they African
