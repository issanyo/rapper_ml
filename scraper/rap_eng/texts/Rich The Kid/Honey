[Chorus]
Little bit, little bit, little bit
A little bit of honey
Never hurt nobody
Never hurt nobody
Just a sip, just a sip, just a sip
Now baby all up on me
A little bit of honey
Never hurt nobody

[Verse 1]
Watch me drip, drip, drip
Got that sugar, sugar, sugar, sugar
On my lips, on my cherry lips
These kind of lips need tasting
Taste on, taste on, taste on
Comfy, I know you crave some
Ain't gotta ask, turn it on
Make it happen, turn it on

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't know 'bout it
Can't come up away
Ain't no burn up from this
Gotta taste something sweet 'fore you come through me

[Chorus]
Little bit, little bit, little bit
A little bit of honey
Never hurt nobody
Never hurt nobody
Just a sip, just a sip, just a sip
Now baby all up on me
A little bit of honey
Never hurt nobody

[Verse 2]
Grip, grab it quick (quick, quick)
Got that sugar, sugar, sugar, sugar
Take, come on take a dip
Yum, yum, come get some
Taste on, taste on, taste on
Comfy, I know you crave some
Ain't gotta ask, turn it on
Make it happen, turn it on

[Chorus]
Little bit, little bit, little bit
A little bit of honey
Never hurt nobody
Never hurt nobody
Just a sip, just a sip, just a sip
Now baby all up on me
A little bit of honey
Never hurt nobody

[Bridge]
I got what you want, I got what you need
You need some raw, you need some sweet
I got what you want, I got what you need
You need some raw, you need some sweet

[Chorus]
Little bit, little bit, little bit
A little bit of honey
Never hurt nobody
Never hurt nobody
Just a sip, just a sip, just a sip
Now baby all up on me
A little bit of honey
Never hurt nobody
