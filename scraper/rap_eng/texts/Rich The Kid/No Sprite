[Intro: Rich the Kid]
Drinking lean out the bottle
We drinking lean out the bottle

[Hook: Rich the Kid]
I drink lean out the pint, I don't need no Sprite
I don't need no Sprite, I don't need no Sprite
I sip Act., it's aight, I don't need no Sprite
I don't need no Sprite, I don't need no Sprite
I sip lean by the pint, that's a money sign
I don't need no Sprite, I don't need no Sprite
I sip Act., it's aight, I don't need no Sprite
I don't need no Sprite, I don't need no Sprite

[Verse 1: Rich the Kid]
I don't need no Sprite, I don't need no roof
Went and got another 'Rari, I don't need no Coop
Bitches kissing on it, I got the work if you want it
I'm sipping lean in the morning
Sipping the syrup and I'm coughing
I need a cup of the codeine, she pop a pill now she rolling
Bitch a bitch, go both ways, I stack on that lean but I run with the K
I'm in the block when it's hot, sippin' the Actavis screwdriver
Selling a pour of the [?]
Drinking the lean and I cannot stop

[Hook]
I don't need no Sprite, I don't need no Sprite
I sip Act., it's aight, I don't need no Sprite
I don't need no Sprite, I don't need no Sprite
I sip lean by the pint, that's a money sign
I don't need no Sprite, I don't need no Sprite
I sip Act., it's aight, I don't need no Sprite
I don't need no Sprite, I don't need no Sprite


[Verse 2: Andy Milonakis]
Fuck Trump, he a lame, he a scab
Stacking gold in the hamper and all I do is dab
I be dabbing in the cabin, stab like junior demons
Work at Mickey D's and I'd still be a genius
Young Sachi feeling low like two bars
Fuck with my fam, fam you'll be FUBAR
Milonakis, old like the Acropolis
Cold like the apocalypse, I flow like Metalocolypse
B.A. Baracus shit, like A-Team
Stay with my contacts, like saline
Red on deck, not the HiTek
We talkin' 50k Cams, like a diplomat check
Got more act than L.A
Ese comprende, comprendo, lean with extendos
Bitch you got pretendo
Me and Rich rich bitch, no new friends though
I sip lean out the pint, I don't need no Sprite
Fuck a Bloody Mary, sipping Act. on my flight
Bitch

[Hook]
I don't need no Sprite, I don't need no Sprite
I sip Act., it's aight, I don't need no Sprite
I don't need no Sprite, I don't need no Sprite
I sip lean by the pint, that's a money sign
I don't need no Sprite, I don't need no Sprite
I sip Act., it's aight, I don't need no Sprite
I don't need no Sprite, I don't need no Sprite
