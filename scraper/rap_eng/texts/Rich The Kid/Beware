We at the top floor

Run that money counter baby

Water clear (water), she gon' stare (stare)
This ain't fair (fair), bitch beware (huh)
Give a fuck 'bout a bitch (uh), I'm poppin' shit (shit)

Ooh, my plug pull up on a carpet, Aladdin (plug)
Ooh, I was just broke as a bitch, now I'm havin'

[Verse 2: YBN Almighty Jay]
Two hoes wanna fuck, switcharoo (whoa)

Water faucet pussy wet like a pool (wet)
Fuck it up, dive in like ooh

Got a chopstick for the nigga that sneak diss
You don't want problems (problems)
Spikes on my shoe with the red at the bottom
Came from the bottom, went straight to the top
Can't cuff that lil bitch 'cause I ain't no cop (bitch)
Just copped a new chain (chain)
My bro in the trap choppin' bricks like Liu Kang (chop, chop)
These niggas too lame (huh)
You lovin that bitch, boy you bought her a new ring (what)
Gone on that rap shit
Had to slow it down, had to get off that trap shit (trap)
You signed a deal with a lame nigga (lame nigga)
Just golden Ferrai and lane switch it (skrrt)
That bitch acting bougie, you hang with her (bougie)
Ice on my bitch, make her rain shiver (cold)
Ooh, two hoes (two hoes)
Drive in the coupe with two doors (whoa)
