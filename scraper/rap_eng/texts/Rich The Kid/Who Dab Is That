[Intro: Quavo]
Ay man, over here at QC the empire man
We really tired of these niggas running off with the swag
Ooh, I mean dab
We don’t call it swag no more
Y’all lame ass sucker ass niggas

[Hook: Quavo][x2]
Who dab is that? Who dab is that?
Who dab is that? Who dab is that?
Who dab is that? Who dab is that?
Who dab is that? Who dab is that?
You ran with that dabbin’, now give it back
I think that it’s time that you give it back
You ran with that dabbin’, now give it back
I think that it’s time that you give it back

[Verse 1: Offset]
Who brought Versace back?
Who’s bando was the trap?
You know we invented that
You can go look it up on the internet
Give it back, give it back, give it back
Make that bitch put the dope in her kitty cat
Maison Margiela, I mix and match
Watching my dab like it’s cinemax
Dab on them folks, dab on them folks, I do it
Eat it up, eat it up ‘til you get full
We ball like Kareem, I’m talking that bull
Smoking on gas, smelling like cow manure
We trendsetters, we piped em up with the dab
Infected, you niggas spread it like a rash
Emmitt Smith, we brought the stakes, need the cash
I’ll take you to dab school, 10 thousand a class

[Hook: Quavo][x2]
Who dab is that? Who dab is that?
Who dab is that? Who dab is that?
Who dab is that? Who dab is that?
Who dab is that? Who dab is that?
You ran with that dabbin’, now give it back
I think that it’s time that you give it back
You ran with that dabbin’, now give it back
I think that it’s time that you give it back

[Verse 2: Quavo]
Run Forrest run! (Run with the dab)
Baow, I shot him with the gun
I should’ve played for the Phoenix Suns
I got a white ho, she a nun
I met the plug in Vietnam
You taking my dab, you the Migos’ son
Counting up guap at the top of the Renaissance
Preaching the dab like I’m Quavo reverend

[Verse 3 - Skippa Da Flippa]
(Dab, dab, get em Flippa!)
Put your head in your arm like you’re sneezing
My dick in her mouth like she teething
And I go crazy with it like a heathen
I’m the first one that dabbed with the leg kick
Took it, I could’ve gave you an assist
You claim you dab king then you taking a risk
I can teach you how to move but it’s gon’ cost a brick

[Hook: Quavo][x2]
Who dab is that? Who dab is that?
Who dab is that? Who dab is that?
Who dab is that? Who dab is that?
Who dab is that? Who dab is that?
You ran with that dabbin’, now give it back
I think that it’s time that you give it back
You ran with that dabbin’, now give it back
I think that it’s time that you give it back

[Verse 3: Rich The Kid]
Heard he talkin’ bout the dab
Broke niggas gettin’ mad
Hating nigga you a clown homie
Dab king, put the crown on me
Look at my dab, bad bitch
Foreign thick, red with the ass on her
She think I’mma put a few bags on her
I fuck her one time and I dab on her

[Verse 4: Takeoff]
I fuck her one time and I dab on her
After I fuck her then I call a cab on her
My niggas serving that cash only
My niggas trap on the block with them bags on me
Who dab is that, niggas know we invented that
Fathered you babies, I fed em that Similac
Ain’t no discussion, you know we gon’ handle that
[?] then went and dabbed, that’s a dab attack
(Takeoff)

[Outro: Takeoff]
Yeah
Dab is contagious
Dab went world wide
We gave the whole world dab fever
