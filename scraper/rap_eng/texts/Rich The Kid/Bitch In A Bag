[Chorus: LouGotCash]
I put that bitch in a bag, I bought that bitch some new Remy
She suck my dick in the Bentley, I fucked that bitch off the Henny
She said I be treatin' her bad, baby you know I got plenty
Bitch you just one out of many, can't fuck with that bitch, she too friendly
She love me, I don't doubt her
Money machine, watch me count up
Hundred bands, look like a mountain
Them diamonds dance, look like a fountain

[Verse 1: LouGotCash]
Just get that head, yeah, hmm, baby you know I want face and shit
Ayy, yeah, Louie don't be on that basic shit
Bad boy, lookin' like Diddy and Ma$e and shit
Trapper, if I got the time I'ma face the shit
She tweakin' now, she geekin' now, she keep callin' my phone
I put you in a Lyft bitch, how you gettin' home?
If I get you the Lyft bitch you gotta give me dome
And now I'm on that savage shit, pockets gettin' swole
She want my dick when I back up
I'm feelin' like Future with mask off
Nigga I'm puttin' them racks on
That's when they takin' them racks off
Lil bitch brazy, she gon' play me, how she gon' pay me
Bitch too brazy
Every time I turn around niggas gon' say they made me

[Chorus: LouGotCash]
I put that bitch in a bag, I bought that bitch some new Remy
She suck my dick in the Bentley, I fucked that bitch off the Henny
She said I be treatin' her bad, baby you know I got plenty
Bitch you just want all the mini, can't fuck with that bitch, she too friendly
She love me, I don't doubt her
Money machine, watch me count up
Hundred bands, look like a mountain
Them diamonds dance, look like a fountain

[Verse 2: Rich The Kid]
Took your bitch, she say I'm handsome
Diamonds on me, they be dancin'
Fuck her in the Wraith, she fancy
She want lick me and my AP
Fast money like a mountain
Too many racks, I need an accountant
I'm fuckin' her bouncin'
Got cash, keep hundreds around em
Gucci on my fit, your bitch on my dick
Hate me 'cause I'm rich, these niggas counterfeit

[Chorus: LouGotCash]
I put that bitch in a bag, I bought that bitch some new Remy
She suck my dick in the Bentley, I fucked that bitch off the Henny
She said I be treatin' her bad, baby you know I got plenty
Bitch you just want all the mini, can't fuck with that bitch, she too friendly
She love me, I don't doubt her
Money machine, watch me count up
Hundred bands, look like a mountain
Them diamonds dance, look like a fountain
