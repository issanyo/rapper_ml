[Intro]
Omar on that come up
Danny I see you

[Chorus: Hoodrich Pablo Juan]
Everything rare, everything rare, everything rare, everything rare
Everything rare, everything rare, everything rare, everything rare
Everything rare, everything rare, everything rare, everything rare
Everything rare, everything rare, everything rare, yeah
Foreign car, I got the trunk in the rear
Foreign bitch with me and she got long hair
Everything rare, exotic Gelato, put weed in the air
Thirty-two squares and they white like veneers
Everything rare, customized gear
Everything rare, the flawless baguettes make 'em stare
I pour up that Act, I can't share, it's too rare, yeah

[Verse 1: Hoodrich Pablo Juan]
You want that beef, get it well done
Got a bad bitch way from Belgium
Twenty-five pints, I won't sell one
Swang the door with the gun and turn the scale on
I hang by myself, who the fuck I'ma tell on?
Get the trap right by the marathon
Mixed bitch, I hit that pussy like Barry Bonds
Mix the codeine with caffeine and drop it in styrofoam
We the first with the emoji chain and it three tones
Yeah, everything rare
My stripper bitch ass look just like a pear
Off-White Nikes, I got every pair, they rare
When it get cold I just put on Moncler
Cashed out for the foreign, it cost your career
Rari mustard, catch up lil nigga
I don't need no stylist, I got too much charisma
I got some niggas that's richer than you, still in prison
I bought all the Balmains at the boutique
No cheap shit, take my bitch on a shopping spree
Soon as I post on the 'Gram, they copy me
Girl you got blessed if you can get on top of me
Backwood vanilla, came way from overseas
Whole team balling, everybody shoot like the Dream Team
Racks in my pockets they stuffed like some green beans
I know you ain't got these new Christian Dior jeans

[Chorus: Hoodrich Pablo Juan]
Everything rare, everything rare, everything rare, everything rare
Everything rare, everything rare, everything rare, everything rare
Everything rare, everything rare, everything rare, everything rare
Everything rare, everything rare, everything rare, yeah
Foreign car, I got the trunk in the rear
Foreign bitch with me and she got long hair
Everything rare, exotic Gelato, put weed in the air
Thirty-two squares and they white like veneers
Everything rare, customized gear
Everything rare, the flawless baguettes make 'em stare
I pour up that Act, I can't share, it's too rare, yeah

[Verse 2: Rich The Kid]
Ayy my bitch too rare, you can't find her
She a thick lil thang, and she kinda, ooh
Pussy too good, put her right in designer
Young rich nigga, pockets cheese like lasagna
Blue cheese, that's hunchos
Rich Forever, I'm the honcho
Need my cash like pronto
Cuban link, that's a condo
He ain't getting cash for real, nigga
You ain't never seen six figures
They gon' talk a lot of shit, I don't care
Just to keep it one hundred, that's rare, ooh
New foreign, dashboard
Ain't talking lil bitch, I paid cash for it
I fucked your ho cause she asked for it
I was just broke on my last, boy
Boy stop it, you ain't poppin
Bentley truck, take a bitch to go shopping
We ain't talking 'bout the money, we got it
I want a Rolls Royce truck, no Audi
That's rare, VVS that's clear
Ain't seen a rich nigga, she stare
I been flexing too much, ain't fair

[Chorus: Hoodrich Pablo Juan]
Everything rare, everything rare, everything rare, everything rare
Everything rare, everything rare, everything rare, everything rare
Everything rare, everything rare, everything rare, everything rare
Everything rare, everything rare, everything rare, yeah
Foreign car, I got the trunk in the rear
Foreign bitch with me and she got long hair
Everything rare, exotic Gelato, put weed in the air
Thirty-two squares and they white like veneers
Everything rare, customized gear
Everything rare, the flawless baguettes make 'em stare
I pour up that Act, I can't share, it's too rare, yeah
