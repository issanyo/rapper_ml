[Intro: Future & Rich The Kid]

[Chorus: Future]
I take exotic drugs
I take exotic drugs
I take exotic drugs
I got exotic plugs
I got exotic hoes
I got exotic cars
I got exotic sticks
I got this Adderall
I take exotic drugs
I take exotic drugs
I take exotic drugs
I take exotic drugs

[Verse 1: Rich The Kid]
I'm in designer truck
I got a exotic plug
Hop in the Bently truck
The Molly, she eat it up
Pinky ring takin' a bath
I'm on a pill and a half
Ridin' around with a quarter mil' cash
Bitch, I'm rich, got 'em mad
Check came quick
Hurricane wrist
New foreign too exotic
Thick white, got her straight out of Follies
I'm in exotic trucks
My wrist is new freezer up
The bank got 'em fitted up
No cappin', go read it up
I done ran off with some seals, we been trappin', just a lil'
Pockets full of bills, if you real, let me feel
In Paris, sold out
Bentayga a robot
Man, fuck what they talkin' 'bout
Yo' bitch could get kicked out
Exotic
Kickin' shit wit' the pilot
I got the Lamb', no mileage
She got a brain, outta college

[Chorus: Future]
I take exotic drugs
I take exotic drugs
I take exotic drugs
I got exotic plugs
I got exotic hoes
I got exotic cars
I got exotic sticks
I got this Adderall
I take exotic drugs
I take exotic drugs
I take exotic drugs
I take exotic drugs

[Verse 2: Young Thug]
Fuck around and show some love to the plug
100K Versace down my rugs
I got my ice from Alaska
And I'm on fire like Tobasco
You tried to cross me, you bastard
Pop at they head like a Snapple
I could act like it ain't nothin'
Meanwhile, my nigga gettin' drastic
Meanwhile, my nigga gettin' treacherous
Meanwhile, my niggas get messy
I bust a nut, that's a lesson
She havin' orgasms at Westin
You see yo' enemy, you clutchin'
I see my enemy, I'm bustin'
I'm wide awake, wide awake, wide awake
I got cake like it my birthday
That white powder like funnel cake
Yeah, I got a bar today
Hey, I make the charts today
Hey, I caught a charge today
Paid my lawyer then beat the case
Hey, never repeat the case
Hey, I'ma defeat the case
Hey, I gave 'em three mil'
Yeah, and I got the key today

[Chorus: Future]
I take exotic drugs
I take exotic drugs
I take exotic drugs
I got exotic plugs
I got exotic hoes
I got exotic cars
I got exotic sticks
I got this Adderall
I take exotic drugs
I take exotic drugs
I take exotic drugs
I take exotic drugs

[Outro: Future]
DJ Eskimo city
I take exotic drugs
I take exotic drugs
I take exotic drugs
I got exotic plugs
