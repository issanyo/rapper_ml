[Intro: Saweetie]
We got London On Da Track
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
London On Da Track, London On Da Track, bitch
London On Da Track, London On Da Track, bitch

[Verse 1: Saweetie]
From the Bay to Sacramento all the way to SoCal
I'm a West coast nigga with a bougie ass sound
And I love me a real nigga, fuck them clowns
Fresh wax, Gucci down, when my man's in town
For the haters, you don't wanna fuck with me (nope)
You could never stunt on me (mmm, mmm)
Used to do promo for the free
Now I only post for a fee (uh huh)
All my niggas stay prepared, all my partnas with the shits
So all they ask is when and where
Call 'em up, nigga where you at? I'm there
Man, I got them doin' whatever, they was there when no one cared
We the ones y'all wanna copy, I ain't close to everybody
And you know I'm hella busy, you should text and never call me
I need to change my number soon, AT&T make that arrangement
And if it ain't about that money, it's a waste of conversation (bye)

[Chorus: Saweetie]
All my niggas yeah we up now (all my niggas yeah we up now)
All my niggas yeah we up now (all my niggas yeah we up now)
All my niggas yeah we up now (all my niggas yeah we up now)
Only way is up, we ain't goin' down (only way is up, we ain't goin' down)
All my haters show me love now (love now)
We gon' run it up in the club now (club now)
All my niggas yeah we up now
Only way is up, we ain't goin' down

[Verse 2: Rich The Kid]
Bought a Bentley 'cause I'm up now (ayy)
Ass fat, tell her, "Turn around" (turn around, woah)
Rich nigga, bring the cash out (rich)
If she bad, I'ma fuck her in my trap house (ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
Give me sloppy, girl, turn her to an icy girl (ice)
That's your wifey? I might put her in a coupe, swerve (yeah)
No roof, ridin' 'round, I got two birds (two birds)
Bitch, I'm way too geeked, more than two nerds (geek)
I need racks, I don't talk, do my plug walk (plug walk)
Fuck your bitch, kick her out, make that ho walk (bitch)
I'm not Cupid (Cupid), she a groupie (groupie)
Grandpa used to trap out a hoopty (trap, yeah)
Too much cash, I done ran it up (ran it up)
Broke nigga better back up (back up)
I need a Brinks truck (Brinks truck), Cuban linked up (linked up)
Even if she bad, face down, ass up (huh)

[Chorus: Saweetie]
All my niggas yeah we up now (all my niggas yeah we up now)
All my niggas yeah we up now (all my niggas yeah we up now)
All my niggas yeah we up now (all my niggas yeah we up now)
Only way is up, we ain't goin' down (only way is up, we ain't goin' down)
All my haters show me love now (love now)
We gon' run it up in the club now (club now)
All my niggas yeah we up now
Only way is up, we ain't goin' down

[Verse 3: G-Eazy]
Gerald, ayy
Leave the stage, buy the chain all bust-down (all bust-down)
Ayy, Bay Area, we up now (we up now)
Ayy, tap in when you touch down (for real, though)
I feel like Marshawn with the touchdown
Got my 2012 OG Nike Yeezys on
All around the world, yeah, they know the G-Eazy song
Bay to the world, tryna put my city on
I got you on a verse, Saweetie what you need me on?
Let me know, Sac to the O
I was gone for a minute, came back with the glow
I come from the Bay where they actually go (dumb, dumb)
I could buy a house, but I stash for my show, yeah, yeah
New Ferrari, yeah, I'm up now
Plus I own the liquor company and my cut now
Stillhouse, that's what's up now (yee)
It's really no limit, 'cause I don't really give a fuck now (Stillhouse)
I hear people runnin' their mouth
I only moved 350 miles south
I got my credentials, they know what I'm 'bout
I've been validated, I ain't even gotta say it, yeah
Hyphy, hyphy, hyphy, hyphy

[Chorus: Saweetie]
All my niggas yeah we up now (all my niggas yeah we up now)
All my niggas yeah we up now (all my niggas yeah we up now)
All my niggas yeah we up now (all my niggas yeah we up now)
Only way is up, we ain't goin' down (only way is up, we ain't goin' down)
All my haters show me love now (love now)
We gon' run it up in the club now (club now)
All my niggas yeah we up now
Only way is up, we ain't goin' down
