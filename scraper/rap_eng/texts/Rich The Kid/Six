15 hundred for Margielas
I've been flexin', diamonds wet I got 'em jealous
Side bitch, give her no kiss
My niggas on some hoe shit
Gucci bag pour a six
Rings on me like six
15 hundred for Margielas
I've been flexin', diamonds wet I got 'em jealous
Side bitch, give her no kiss
My niggas on some hoe shit
Gucci bag pour a six
Rings on me like six

[Verse]
Keep flexin' my diamonds bustin', Margielas on me they jealous
I just might take ya to Paris
Money comin' too scary
I got the check and they hatin'
Broke rappers in their feelings
Rich Forever got a label damn now walk 'round wit a few milli
I got yo' bitch the comments
We do not go for the nonsense
Fuck around and go messy
Rich bought yo' son (?)
I was in school barely
Teachers callin' me a felon
Now my baby from Australia
Diamonds dancin' and I'm a playa
Got a bitch and she pay off
One strippa she laid off
Swervin' I'm gettin' topped off
Big diamonds like golf balls
OG pour I had to sleep on the floor
Flexed up I'm the CEO
Fuck three hoes in a row
These niggas actin' like hoes

Side bitch, give her no kiss
My niggas on some hoe shit
Gucci bag pour a six
Rings on me like six
