[Intro : Rich The Kid]
Trap?
I got rich nigga problem
I'M RICH!

[Hook x2 : Rich The Kid]
Wake up in the morning get paper
Money real long, got acres
Fuck it, we don't need no neighbors
Richer than a motherfuckin' mayor (I'M RICH!)
I'm livin' my life just like Diddy, I'm livin' like Diddy!
I'm livin' my life just like Diddy, I'm livin' like Diddy!

[Verse 1 : Rich The Kid]
Livin' like Diddy, the king of my city
I ride in a masi I switch to the Bentley
I ride in a Audi I switch to the 'Rarri
Call me Bugatti
Sippin' on lakers
You know but I hate her
My bitch from Jamaica
I'm countin' the twenty's the fifty's the hundreds
I'm stackin' the paper
Walk in my room with 3 bitches they naked
She poppin a Molly she's already faded
Katrina call FEMA my neck is flooded
Spacin' and patchin' these bitches are dirty
Cappin' and trappin' I wrap it in plastic
Reachin' it over, got racks in the attic
Livin' like Diddy, pull up in a Bentley
My bitch got siddity

[Hook]

[Verse 2 : Jose Guapo]
2 bitches want me, my diamonds they dancin' like Diddy
Is love to shit I'll tell a fuck nigga I'm a kingpin in my city
Versace, Versace, young nigga feelin' like Biggie
Shoe grain safari California 'Rari, got a lot in the engine
That bitch is bad like Cassie
This money is dirty, it's nasty
My fashion come way from Paris
She fucked it, she sucked it in the Aston
I'm smokin, I'm leanin' and I'm laughin at peasants
I think I'm P.Diddy, get out of my presence
Your bitches gon' fuck cause they know that they want me
I'm a Bad Boy, nigga know I keep the Willie on me

[Hook]
