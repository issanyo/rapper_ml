[Verse 1: Sad Frosty]
I got that Whoopi Goldberg on my shirt
Still talkin' reckless and he'll and get merked
Remix, I had to get Rich on the verse
I fuck on that bitch and I pull up her skirt
I feel like Rich, I don't walk with the plug
I'm out in LA and they showin' me love
I just wanna fuck, I ain't givin' no hugs
Keep right on me cause the goofy's some bugs
Look, ay, I fuck that bitch in the ass
I passed her to Tay 'cause that pussy was trash
Pull in the Wraith, do the digital dash
I'm takin' your money, finesse all the cash
Them broke boys they hatin', they plottin' the low
Tearin' up my wrist, and my diamonds on froze
Next sack I get I'ma cop me a Rov
Not enough money I need me some mo'

[Verse 2: Rich The Kid]
Look at my wrist, thats a whole thang
I got more chains on than 2 Chainz
I got a bitch out the Blue Flame
My diamonds they kickin' like Liu Kang
First off, yeah a nigga so broke
Hatin' on me, you a joke
I can't get shit in you studio
The trap, I'm movin' them elbows
I got white, white Taylor Swift
I'm gonna jump in the bridge
I made a mil with a wrist
That a real Rollie, no fool
Bad bitch, I need two
Look at my neck, bust down
Pussy niggas, don't come 'round
I got a shooter might gun ya down
Rich Forever, got minions now
Turn your smile to a frown
Came out the trap, bando was a house
