[Chorus]
I been in and out of jail, I grew up in these streets
I be juuging for for real, I grew up in these streets (juug)
I be flexing on these hoes, I grew up in these streets (flex)
I ain't never had a job, I grew up in these streets (no job)
I grew up in these streets (streets), I grew up in these streets (I did)
I grew up in these streets (juug), I grew up in these streets (flex)
I been in and out of jail I grew up in these streets (jail)
I be juuging for for real I grew up in these streets (juug)
Yeah

[Verse 1]
My parents all the way from Haiti, I was born in Queens
Smash 'em then I toss 'em like some chicken wings (them hoes)
Now I'm getting money, everything is foreign
If it ain't foreign then it ain't important
Now I'm pulling up in Astons and the Maseratis (skrr)
When I'm on the scene you better tell some body
Came down from the N-Y
To the A yeah, a nigga so fly
Can't lie 'cause the hold hood fuck with me
Got your girl rolling on a molly
Straight up, just met your ho, now she trying to fuck

[Chorus]
I been in and out of jail, I grew up in these streets
I be juuging for for real, I grew up in these streets (juug)
I be flexing on these hoes, I grew up in these streets (flex)
I ain't never had a job, I grew up in these streets (no job)
I grew up in these streets (streets), I grew up in these streets (I did)
I grew up in these streets (juug), I grew up in these streets (flex)
I been in and out of jail I grew up in these streets (jail)
I be juuging for for real I grew up in these streets (juug)
Yeah

[Verse 2]
You see this Rolex on my wrist, I got this shit from juuging
I ain't no chef but I'm steady cooking
Young rich nigga straight up out them bricks
In a foreign whip, with a foreign bitch (skrr)
Now I'm rocking all Versace and the Prada shoes
If you try me nigga you up on the news
Have your baby mama singing the blues
A hundred thousand dollars stuffed in my Tru's
Rapping on some hundred thousand dollar beats
Young rich nigga straight up out them streets
And I got them goons for your ass
They gon' blast, just for cash, leave you dead real fast

[Chorus]
I been in and out of jail, I grew up in these streets
I be juuging for for real, I grew up in these streets (juug)
I be flexing on these hoes, I grew up in these streets (flex)
I ain't never had a job, I grew up in these streets (no job)
I grew up in these streets (streets), I grew up in these streets (I did)
I grew up in these streets (juug), I grew up in these streets (flex)
I been in and out of jail I grew up in these streets (jail)
I be juuging for for real I grew up in these streets (juug)
Yeah
