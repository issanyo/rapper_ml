[Chorus: Yung Mal]
Bag way, the bag way
I ain't goin' out sad nowadays
We rich forever, we forever gettin' paid
1017 around my neck, it came from Pheasant
The bag way, the bag way
Two hundred on my dash, yeah the fast way
We fuck 'em back to back, these hoes getting laid
We love to flex, we love to stunt, we came from nothing

[Verse 1: Lil Quill & Yung Mal]
We love to flex, we love to stunt, we come from nothing
Foreign cost me 'bout six figures, I'm not balling on no budget
Plug called me with them babies, we gon' wrap 'em up in Huggies
[?] LA this edition covered all over my luggage (the bag way, the bag way)
I get this shit the fast way
I do the dash, I drag race
Count up that cash, I'm fast paced
A nigga broke in last place (I ain't goin' out sad nowadays)
I'ma pull up no mask, run out with the K, okay

[Chorus: Yung Mal]
Bag way, the bag way
I ain't goin' out sad nowadays
We rich forever, we forever gettin' paid
1017 around my neck, it came from Pheasant
The bag way, the bag way
Two hundred on my dash, yeah the fast way
We fuck 'em back to back, these hoes getting laid
We love to flex, we love to stunt, we came from nothing

[Verse 2: Rich The Kid]
I fuck 'em back to back, we got them racks on racks
You got a piggy bank, I got a bigger bag
Ooh AP bustin', we get money
Count a hundred, she go dummy
Back in the bag, bag way, I was gettin' to the cash
I do the dash, new foreign and I ain't got a tag
She come this way, might get that black Wraith
Patek the black face, this the bag way

[Chorus: Yung Mal]
Bag way, the bag way
I ain't goin' out sad nowadays
We rich forever, we forever gettin' paid
1017 around my neck, it came from Pheasant
The bag way, the bag way
Two hundred on my dash, yeah the fast way
We fuck 'em back to back, these hoes getting laid
We love to flex, we love to stunt, we came from nothing
