[Intro: Lil Mouse]
Mouse
Let's get it
Count up the bands
Rich The Kid, what up, man?
We in here, man
That just what I do
Nigga, that just what I do

[Chorus: Rich The Kid]
Hit the mall and blow them bands, nigga, that just what I do
Blow that money like a fan, nigga, that just what I do
The next morning I be shoppin', nigga, that just what I do
Spend that money with my crew, nigga, that just what I do
That just what I do, nigga, that just what I do
That just what I do, nigga, that just what I do
Hit the mall and spend them bands, nigga, that just what I do
Blow that money like a fan, nigga, that just what I do

[Verse 1: Rich The Kid]
Okay, Louis on the floor, Fendi on the wall
I ain't never went to school, all I know is ball
Got racks on racks on bands, got money in my hands
Got three much money in my pockets, can't fit in my pants
In the jewelry store with Mouse, I just bought a house
He just bought a mansion, now we in there money dancin'
Hella bands, hella bands, throwin' hella bands
In the strip club underage, throwin' hella bands
Smash 'em, I don't cuff 'em, I just pass 'em to my partner
All these haters, I don't see 'em like my name was Stevie Wonder
Me and Lil Mouse in the club poppin' Ros√©
Three bad foreign bitches and they goin' both ways

[Chorus: Rich The Kid & Lil Mouse]
Hit the mall and blow them bands, nigga, that just what I do
Blow that money like a fan, nigga, that just what I do
The next morning I be shoppin', nigga, that just what I do
Spend that money with my crew, nigga, that just what I do
That just what I do, nigga, that just what I do
That just what I do (Mouse), nigga, that just what I do (let's get it)
Hit the mall and spend them bands (bands), nigga, that just what I do (grra, boom, grra)
Blow that money like a fan, nigga, that just what I do (grra, grra)

[Verse 2: Lil Mouse]
In the club, party hard (party), man, that just what I do (let's get it)
Throwin' money at lil' momma (bands), that's gon' make her chew my crew (she chew it)
Livin' life like a rock star, Lil Mouse is that dude (Mouse)
If you get too disrespectful (bow, bow), Rich The Kid, he gon' shoot (grra)
Money dance, hella bands (bands), hold my belt loop through that Louis (Louis)
I ain't talkin' Waka Flocka, you want beef, then oh, let's do it (boom, boom)
On the nine, yeah, we grind, you mess up, and then we pull it (grra)
NBB, yeah we rollin' my hitters on [?] (let's get it)
At the mall, yeah, I ball, dude, give my belt that puddle
Livin' life, dude, big [?]
Goin' down, and I'm spinnin' now, dude look like a yo-yo (grra)
In the club with a model chick (grra), she takin' the photos (grra)

[Chorus: Rich The Kid]
Hit the mall and blow them bands, nigga, that just what I do
Blow that money like a fan, nigga, that just what I do
The next morning I be shoppin', nigga, that just what I do
Spend that money with my crew, nigga, that just what I do
That just what I do, nigga, that just what I do
That just what I do, nigga, that just what I do
Hit the mall and spend them bands, nigga, that just what I do
Blow that money like a fan, nigga, that just what I do
