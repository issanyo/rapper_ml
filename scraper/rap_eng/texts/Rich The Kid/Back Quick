[Intro: YBN Almighty Jay & Rich The Kid]
Ooh, I fuck yo' bitch from the back
Don't worry, nigga, I'ma give her back (ayy, throw it back quick)
Ooh, I'm tryna run up the racks
YBN like the Men in Black (know what I'm sayin', fuck a check up at Saks Fifth)
Ooh, bitch tryna finesse my chain
She come back, then she gettin' smacked (ooh)
Ooh, bitch had the gang run a train
Knock the pussy right off the tracks (huh)
Woah, woah, woah, woah, gang, gang
Bitch, whatchu-whatchu, gang, gang (bitch)
Gang, gang, gang, ayy (ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
