[Intro: Rich The Kid]
Run that money counter, baby
Nah, yeah run the money counter
Need all that
Having more paper, more haters
You feel me?
Narquise, turn that shit up
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ayy

[Chorus: Rich The Kid]
On my rich shit (rich), got a rich bitch
And my wrist sick, we the wave bitch (the wave)
Ooh, too many racks, need a new vault (new vault)
Can't get a bag, now she pissed off (she mad)
I'm the biggest boss since Rick Ross (Rick Ross)
New ice, freeze my wrist off (what)

[Verse 1: Rich The Kid & Famous Dex]
Got a rich bitch (rich), on my rich shit (huh)
Don't need to park it (park), Bentley smart [?] (skrrt)
Ride the wave, watch out for the sharks
I don't want the bitch, I'm just breaking her heart (bitch)
Too many racks out (uh, Dexter)
Me and young Dexter geeked up in the traphouse (ha, ooh)

[Verse 2: Famous Dex]
Too many racks [?]
I just might pour up a pint
Don't want that bitch 'cause she stank
I was so broke now I run in the bank
Say you get money, you ain't
Smoking on dope, me and Jay
