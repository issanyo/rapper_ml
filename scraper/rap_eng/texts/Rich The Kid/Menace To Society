[Hook]
A menace to society
Free my boys Bobby and Rowdy
I was just scraping up change
Everything changed, I ride in a Masi
12 behind me, I hit the corner, can't find me
They call me a menace to society
I'm riding, no license or ID
A menace to society
Free my boy Bobby and Rowdy
I was just scraping up change
Everything changed, I ride in a Masi
12 behind me, I hit the corner, can't find me
They call me a menace to society
I'm riding, no license or ID

[Verse 1]
Free Rowdy, free Bobby
Fuck 12, we rowdy
Catch a body, catch a body
Bitch I'm geeking, popped a molly
I only fuck with the real niggas
My diamonds they give you the chills nigga
My young niggas keep flexing
Get the check, don't waste the second
I only fuck if she foreign
Lil bitch ride like horses
Diving in the pussy, I'm snorkling
Been way past five, I'm soaring
I'm juvenile, they call me menace
Racks on me, play tennis
I got an Apple Watch
Flooded with diamond rocks
Still make it jump like 2 3
These niggas mad niggas, they jealous
I'ma run it up, keep flexing
I'm bench pressing, money stretching
Bitch I'm a menace, no Dennis
Fuck you lil niggas, I'm winning
I just might go cop the Bentley
You saving that money, got plenty

A menace to society

They call me a menace to society

A menace to society

I was just scraping up change
Everything changed, I ride in a Masi
12 behind me, I hit the corner, can't find me
They call me a menace to society

[Verse 2]
I ran it up in a second
I bet she fuck in a second
Pouring up a four, lean heavy
I told her like Rocko, bitch we ain't goin' steady
Diamonds bitin', break dancin'
I keep flexin' got 'em staring
So many rings like marriage
Pour an eight, I'm looking scary
13, I was hustling
14, I was busting
16, I was taking from something
Run in your house for the money
I could teach you how to rob
I got rich without a job
Make something from nothing, thank God
I just want to win with the squad
They was hating for no reason
I said I'd do it, they didn't believe me
Got kicked out of school, was a menace
Fuck it, I still got my blessing
Everything European, swear I thought I was dreaming
Fucked your bitch then I fucked up Niemans
I pulled up fresh for no reason

[Hook]
A menace to society
