All I know, all I see
Is the money, all I need
I've been runnin', to the green
I've been runnin', to the cheese
All I know, all I see
Is the money, all I need
I've been runnin', to the green
I've been runnin', to the cheese

(Verse 1)
[Rich The Kid]

I been runnin' up that check
I been whippin' up that white
Got a bitch she my favorite ----
She gon' suck the dick good all night
Trappin' made it really happen
From the bottom I was cappin'
We been rappin' in a mattress
I pull up in a Rauri with a bad bitch
You know i'm comin', you know how we comin'
Hundred round drum in, this choppa' start bumpin'
Pull out the stuff and go digital
Bad bitch bro I can't even really fuck with you
Rollie, my diamonds play Pikachu
You look at my necklace say pee-a-boo
My niggas they come with the Mac, no laptop
We drove in a drop top
The Audi, the Mazi, the Rauri, they got 'em
I'm makin' her heart stop
Young rich nigga, walk around with a hunnit bands
Two cup, two cup on ------
I'ma need a fucking kick stand

(Verse 2)
[LIL WEST]

I see you call me, aye
You don't really wanna talk about nothing, aye
Cut that bitch off like my cousin, woah
Don't give a fuck about nothing, aye
This be the reason they love me, wait
I really came out the dungeon, aye
I really came out the slums
Bums, whatever you call it I love it, aye
Jump out the Coupe, and it don't got a roof
Look at these niggas, you can tell that they don't like the truth
They hate what I do, they really just want me to lose
I do what it do, i'm fucking these bitches at school
That's the shit that I feed off
The shit that they hate be the shit that I be on
Fuck this bitch and then tee off
I fuck the bitch good with my mufuckin' tee off
He might need an ER
I pop the bitch once it might just knock his feet off
Use my bitch as the PR
To get all these thirsty ass niggas to hear us
