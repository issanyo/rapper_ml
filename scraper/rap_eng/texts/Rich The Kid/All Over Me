[Verse 1: Quavo]
Got these snakes all over me
I pull up in that bumblebee
And who am I supposed to be?
It's Quavo from the BMG
I'm lookin down, you under me
I am where you wanna be
I'm with your bitch at Benihana's, you take her to Apple Bee's
You don't like me? Cuz I'm rich and I'm icy?
Got flat screens in the head rests and I'm watchin' Remember The Titans
Got a 28 of Cali purp, we call it Minnesota Vikings
Got two foreign hoes, they dykin'
Got a alligator, chopper is bitin'

[Verse 2: Offset]
85 birds Kevin Ogletree (brr)
Catching these plays like Crabtree
In the streets gotta be lowkey
Cause I'm in [?] trap selling low key
In the two-seat, gotta keep the heat
Smoking on the gas, high as fuck call it nose bleed
Got a bitch from Beijing , speak japanese
She know [?]
[?] like morphine
Five rings on looking like Kobe
What the fuck you talking to me, you don't know me
[?] Migo Gang, you know me
Rolex turned me up a couple notches
Versace, Versace, Versace
I got your main bitch over there watching
We takin' shit over like the Nazi

[Verse 4: Rich The Kid]
Versace and Bally, I'm shoppin'
A 100k stuffed in my Robin's
That Bentley departed, the Dolce I bought it
The Aston I'm driving, no license
That Rollie, the Audemar, Breitling
Canary they yellow my diamonds
My bitch might get deported, all my clothes imported
I'm dunking the ball like Kobe
A 100k bezel in my Rollie
The Aston, that 'Rari, that Bentley
On 85 doing 350
You still pulling up in the Tesby
[?] infinity
I'm shining, I'm shining
Versace, Versace, my diamonds
