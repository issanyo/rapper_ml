[Intro: Ski Mask The Slump God & Rich The Kid]
Yuh, yuh (ayee!)
Okay (ya digg)
Lil' stupid, lil' stupid (who it is?), no cupid (umm, no love)
Lil' stupid (bitch, bitch)
Ha, ha, ha, drip
Wet, flex, yuh (can you hear it?)
Lil' stupid, lil' stupid (that's the charge)
Uhm, yuh (ay, ay, ay, ay, ay)

[Chorus: Ski Mask The Slump God]
I'ma drown a nigga in a river of lost souls (I'ma drown)
I'ma drown a nigga in a river of lost souls
Dearly depart from these unmotivated hatin' hoes
Your bitch looking at me up and down
Like an Elder Scroll, ayy!
I'ma drown a nigga in a river of lost souls  (I'ma, yuh, yuh)
I'ma drown a nigga in a river of lost souls (yuh, yuh, ayy!)
Dearly depart from these unmotivated hatin' hoes
Your bitch looking at me up and down
Like an Elder Scroll, huh

[Verse 1: Ski Mask The Slump God]
I fuck ya bitch when I'm bored (I fuck yo' bitch when I'mâ€”)
Because you drive an Accord (because you drive)
I am not Simba, but when I do fuck that bitch
I greet that bitch with a roar (rrr!)
Ferragamo to the floor (ay, ay, ay)
Flow hot like Earth's core (ay, ay, ay)
"Knock, knock, knock" not the sound of the door
That's the sound when I hit your whore, um
Aye little bitch, you need to wake up (ay, ay)
Need face right now, so fuck ya makeup
Aye little bitch, dick when you wake up
'Cause I just woke up in Marc Jacobs
Aye little bitch, Dragon Ball shit diamonds Destructo Disc
Hopped in the gang, anime shit, full One-Punch Man fist

[Chorus: Ski Mask The Slump God & Rich The Kid]
I'ma drown a nigga in a river of lost souls (I'ma drown)
I'ma drown a nigga in a river of lost souls
Dearly depart from these unmotivated hatin' hoes
Your bitch looking at me up and down
Like an Elder Scroll, ayy!
I'ma drown a nigga in a river of lost souls  (I'ma, yuh, yuh)
I'ma drown a nigga in a river of lost souls (yuh, yuh, ayy!)
Dearly depart from these unmotivated hatin' hoes (ya dig)
Your bitch looking at me up and down
Like an Elder Scroll (yuh, aye)

[Verse 2: Rich The Kid]
I might drown a bitch (bitch)
Your money counterfeit (whoa)
Smokin' on a pound and shit (huh)
My diamonds gonna blind you quick
Fuck these rap niggas (what)
Bitch my check bigger (racks)
Too much money gotta hide a milli (hide a milli)
Young rich nigga gotta ride the Bentley (skrt, skrt)
Fake ass Rollie, what it cost ya? (cost ya)
Get bossed around if you ain't bossed up (you ain't bossed up)
Fuck a hater, bring your check up (check up)
Drown a bitch from my neck up (whoa, what)
Slump (slump)
I'm ridin' around with a pump (skrrt)
Five hundred thou in the trunk
Black and white coupe like a skunk (black and white)
She keep starin' what I'm wearin' (yeah)
Hop out the new McLaren (McLaren)
Pinky ring unnecessary
I was broke, I'm legendary (I'm legendary)
Drip (drip)
Way too much water might drown ya (might drown ya)
Deep in the ocean they'll find ya (whoa)
My bitch is foreign, from Canada

[Chorus: Ski Mask The Slump God]
I'ma drown a nigga in a river of lost souls (I'ma drown)
I'ma drown a nigga in a river of lost souls
Dearly depart from these unmotivated hatin' hoes
Your bitch looking at me up and down
Like an Elder Scroll, ayy!
I'ma drown a nigga in a river of lost souls  (I'ma, yuh, yuh)
I'ma drown a nigga in a river of lost souls (yuh, yuh, ayy!)
Dearly depart from these unmotivated hatin' hoes
Your bitch looking at me up and down
Like an Elder Scroll, huh
