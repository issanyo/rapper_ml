Lyrics from a snippet

[Verse]
{?} Hurricane
Young nigga, im ballin' im {?}
Flooded my arms, 50 {?} my charms
Cookin' that dope like my mom
Whippin' a {?} straight from the pot
Stand on the block for the guap
They kick in my door, then I'm running from cops
I got the dope in my sock
Young nigga walk in with the cash
Trap with the OG's gettin' bags
I bust in the trap with no mask
I pull off the lot, a convertible {?}
{?} finna be rich
And nigga, I'm putting more ice in my bezel
Can't see this fuck niggas behind me
Young nigga, I smash in the {?}
