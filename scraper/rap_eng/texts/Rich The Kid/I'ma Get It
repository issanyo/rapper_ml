[Hook: YRN Lingo]
If I want it, I’ma get it
Catch you slipping, take your shoes off your feet
Always running towards a meal ticket
Masi, Bentley, can’t decide it
Pussy really don’t excite me no more
Always got to watch my back, they my foes
Loyalty over everything, that is my oath
Leave a nigga head red like Peg Bundy
One wrong word, my nigga come head hunting
Time is money nigga, and I’m chasing after money
End of discussion
What you gon’ do man, you really just fussing
Leave your whole squad stanking like an onion

[Verse 1: Mango Foo]
Let’s talk about money
I been fiending for the hundreds like junkies
Let’s talk about chronic
Drop a bomb in the trap, it is atomic
Beat the pot like I’m Sonny
Put your bitch on the track like I’m London
I got rings on my fingers, no onion
I invest in a bando, come join me
I got bags on the nawf like I’m Santa Claus
Make your bitch run a play like I’m Randy Moss
Sip the lean out the bottle, no Tylenol
I won’t stop until I get my point across
Pull up, drop the top on the Rari
I got the white like Rowdy
I just put my bitch in the Audi
For no reason, she say that I’m childish
Two hundred thousand, can you count it?
Everybody talkin’ but who ‘bout it?
How these real diamonds but they cloudy?
You ain’t up, you still jugging ounces
My niggas trappin’ out the regal
She eat it up so I’ma feed her
I spent your rent on my re-up
I ball on niggas, make ‘em D up

[Hook: YRN Lingo]
If I want it, I’ma get it
Catch you slipping, take your shoes off your feet
Always running towards a meal ticket
Masi, Bentley, can’t decide it
Pussy really don’t excite me no more
Always got to watch my back, they my foes
Loyalty over everything, that is my oath
Leave a nigga head red like Peg Bundy
One wrong word, my nigga come head hunting
Time is money nigga, and I’m chasing after money
End of discussion
What you gon’ do man, you really just fussing
Leave your whole squad stanking like an onion

[Verse 2: YRN Lingo]
You tellin’ these niggas how you get your money
Nigga what the fuck you doin’?
I’m seeing too many mini-me’s walk around
I’m finna start suing
Talkin’ too much, gon’ get your body wrapped up
And dumped in the sewage
Hold up, who callin’ me from 8-9-6
Never mind, money get to it
Chopper in the backseat
Put a red stain in your white tee
I really don’t do no talking
These niggas pocket watching, stalking

[Verse 3: Rich The Kid]
My bitch is too bossy
I bought her a bag, now guess what it cost me
Yeah I’m flexing and I’m flossing
Hit the plug, I’m Randy Moss-ing
Lingo next up, yeah dat way
I was stuck in the bando all day
Fuck a ho, you a buster, can’t trust her
Birds sing in the trap but no Usher
Broke my wrist in the pot two times
While you love her I’ma hit her on the futon
If I want it I’ma get it
Maserati, no Honda Civic

[Hook: YRN Lingo]
If I want it, I’ma get it
Catch you slipping, take your shoes off your feet
Always running towards a meal ticket
Masi, Bentley, can’t decide it
Pussy really don’t excite me no more
Always got to watch my back, they my foes
Loyalty over everything, that is my oath
Leave a nigga head red like Peg Bundy
One wrong word, my nigga come head hunting
Time is money nigga, and I’m chasing after money
