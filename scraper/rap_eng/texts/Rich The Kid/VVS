[Intro: Rich The Kid]
Ayy ayy ayy ayy, you know what I'm sayin'
This that real deal, you know what I'm sayin'
Y'all niggas still rockin' that fufu, you know what I'm sayin'
No go, that way
Can't go that way
You dig?

[Chorus: Jay Critch]
VV's, diamonds they shining, they 3D
Diamonds they blinding like Stevie
I make the grinding look easy
You got Cartier frames, can't see me
This bitch won't go away, she need me
I ran off with the drank, a PT
That lean got me in space, ET
VV's, diamonds they shining, they 3D
Diamonds they blinding like Stevie
I make the grinding look easy
You got Cartier frames, can't see me
This bitch won't go away, she need me
I ran off with the drank, a PT
That lean got me in space, ET

[Verse 1: Jay Critch]
Diamonds pop out of the chain, 3D
Heard you got all of the cake, PC
Had to spend a couple G's, easy
Got to run to the green, Luigi
Diamonds dancing on the chain like Breezy
John Cena, all these haters can't see me
Shawty your boyfriend a lame, a guini
Niggas playin' with the keys like Stevie
Ayy, watchin' niggas 'cause shit ain't what it seems
Playin' dirty, my soda not clean
Woke up, I was livin' the dream
More bucks, mama need that Celene
Whippin' that foreign like NASCAR
Rich forever nigga, we who they ask for
Off the lean, slowin' down, gotta fast forward
Balmain jeans, nigga fly like a passport

[Chorus: Jay Critch]
VV's, diamonds they shining, they 3D
Diamonds they blinding like Stevie
I make the grinding look easy
You got Cartier frames, can't see me
This bitch won't go away, she need me
I ran off with the drank, a PT
That lean got me in space, ET
VV's, diamonds they shining, they 3D
Diamonds they blinding like Stevie
I make the grinding look easy
You got Cartier frames, can't see me
This bitch won't go away, she need me
I ran off with the drank, a PT
That lean got me in space, ET

[Verse 2: Rich The Kid & Famous Dex]
VV's, diamonds they water like Fiji
Bitches they pull up, come see me
Thought it was Keisha or Ke-Ke
He bought that chain out the middle of the mall
Real ice piss 'em off
VV's on me like big gumball
Stop wearin' knockoffs
Look at your diamonds, so custom
Got a lil bitch from Russia but I can't trust her
Look at that AP, I bust it
I'm a lucky motherfucker
VV's, I get that money, can't see me
Bitch I be ballin' like Stevie
I get the money, believe me
Dexter

[Chorus: Jay Critch]
VV's, diamonds they shining, they 3D
Diamonds they blinding like Stevie
I make the grinding look easy
You got Cartier frames, can't see me
This bitch won't go away, she need me
I ran off with the drank, a PT
That lean got me in space, ET
VV's, diamonds they shining, they 3D
Diamonds they blinding like Stevie
I make the grinding look easy
You got Cartier frames, can't see me
This bitch won't go away, she need me
I ran off with the drank, a PT
That lean got me in space, ET
