[Hook: Rich The Kid]
Baking soda on my Pradas, all I do is fuck the models..
20, 30, 50 bottles..
All I do is count them dollars..
I been about them Benjamins, I said I been about them Benjamins..
I'm all about them Benjamins, I said I been about them Benjamins

[Verse 1: Rich The Kid]
I just bought a new whip, I just bought a new Rove
I got 35 bitches, I don't need no new ho
Got a iPhone 4, got a iPhone 5
Got, niggas tryna kill me so I'm tryna stay alive
Got my nigga T with me and you know he strapped up..
And my nigga peel it so you better back up..
And I'm racked up..
Truey and that Prada
I'm in Magic City Mondays throwing way too many dollars..
Now I'm up in Onyx, strippers up in Follies
Got your girl open and she fuckin' on a Molly
In my Aston Martin, and it's extra Foreign..
Got your old girl with me, bitch is extra boring

Baking soda on my Pradas, all I do is fuck the models..

I'm all about them Benjamins, I said I been about them Benjamins

[Verse 2]
I be draped up in Versace swagger jackers tryna copy
Pull up in that Maserati, foreign bitch she do pilates..
If that pussy good, I put her in Armani
She be flippin' on a Molly, diamonds straight from the Safari
Burberry, Range Rove.. Hit the mall I change clothes
Captain cup, y'all save hoes, well I'm tryna get these bankrolls..
Rolex, Breitling.. Don't you see my diamonds?
Love the way I'm shining, hit the club I'm blinding..
I just bought a Ferragamo Porsche on 26's..
Pull up to the mall and leave with 20 bitches..
Young nigga been about them Benjamins..
Big face hundreds, I be stackin' 'em..
