[HOOK](x2)
I just bought a Rollie bust still ain't got the time for it
Made the bitch get a passport
If it ain't bout money nigga I ain't got the time for it
Two-Fifty on the dashboard
Keep on talking nigga I ain't got the time for it
I be into it I ain't got time for it
I just bought a Rollie bust still ain't got the time for it
I ain't got time for it!

[VERSE 1]
Got a Rollie bust down that's a full one
Bitches talkin, niggas hating, bought a new one
If it ain't money I ain't got time for it
I been working, heavy hand - check the scoreboard
I was broke back then, had to run it up
Now I'm rich, got a bitch in a Porsche truck
Rollie got ice like two cups
Bitches on my dick cause' I'm racked up!
Since a young nigga I was dreaming
Now I drop a hundred off at Neiman's!
Lookin' at the watch bitch this is my time
Staring at my chains you might go blind
Come into the trap I got good gas
Got a brand new chopper for your bitch ass
Keep on talking nigga I ain't got time for it
Leave a fuck niggas brains on the dashboard!

[VERSE 2]
Stacked up my Benjamins, dropped the roof
Made it from nothing and that's the truth
What would you do for the fortune and fame?
Young Rich Nigga changing the game
Stayed independent, we made a name
The Rolex cost fifty at Plain Jane
Taking your bitch out that bra mane
I grabbed it for nothing, not one chain
Ain't got time cause' I'm still trying to run it up
Money on a Motorola when I'm picking up
Hop on a jet and I'm overseas
Momma' she told me go get the cheese
Yeah I'm rich but a nigga's still working
Walk around, Ima' flex on purpose
Finally made it and bought a Rollie
Walking around with a hundred on me
