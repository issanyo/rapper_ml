[Hook] x2
Bankroll to big pull my pants up
She make it clap like a dancer
Lambo , I'mma flex with the doors up
Drink lean in the morning like starbucks
You can't be my girl im sorry
Ain´t loving these hoes they garbage
That´s not my baby like maury
Lil bitty bitch stop calling

[Verse 1]
Bitch stop calling
I told to the bitch stop calling
Drinking lean in the morning
I pour a 4 in the morning
They was hitting on me now I racked up
Mango with the Draco back up
In the kitchen with the pot
Make it bubble up
First i made a hundred bands, then It doubled up
I put them hoe on a blocklist
Breaking a model with a toothpick
I just came for the trap bought a new wrist
Bentley and a rover, Im calling it bover
Imma chop up in a wraith like this
.40 say no how like big
[?]
Goyard on my waist
Ain´t got time for that bitch
I forgot what I did on the percocet
Rich Forever dumb get the pussy wet
Woke up now I´m living my dreams
Watch out for these snakes no Gucci
So wearing new shit now I'm bad and Louie
I told that bitch to stop calling me
Bankroll to big pull my pants up
She make it clap like a dancer

[Hook] x2
Bankroll to big pull my pants up

[Verse 2]
Vlone on me yeah dat way
I took that hoe out to London
Meeting my plug outta country
I got to keep flexin'
The money keep comin'
They’ll put anything on the internet
I was just hustlin´ I wanted the check
I did fuck it up, made it back a thousand times
Who´s trap bad beating letting it alpine
I got the Raf Simons on me
And I knew I would do what god told me
Still buying more rings on the go like Kobe
Young nigga in the trap with the OG´s
My bitch is Bad and Boujee
[?]
These niggas they what, acting like groupies
She ate a Macdonald's but wanted some sushi
Broke ass bitches, [?]
Young rich nigga in the coupe, yeah the Bentley
Diamonds on my neck play tennis
Broke nigga don´t talk just shut up
CEO I’m a boss now
Want a new Bentley truck imm´a cashout
Imma fuck it so good make it tap out

[Hook] x2
Bankroll to big pull my pants up
