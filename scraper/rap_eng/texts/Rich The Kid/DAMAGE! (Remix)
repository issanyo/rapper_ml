[Intro]
Aye! Aye! Wooh! Wooh!

[Hook]
Pull out the choppa, do damage
Ride with the babies, no family (what)
I got the racks that they talk about (racks)
Stay in the trap imma break a pot (break a pot)
Rollie water, real deal (rollie)
Drink, pour up the whole seal (lean)
Momma, I made it like Mike Will (momma)
Trippin' I'm leanin' off 2 pills
Pull out the choppa, do damage
Ride with the babies, no family (what)
I got the racks that they talk about (racks)
Stay in the trap imma break a pot (break a pot)
Rollie water, real deal (rollie)
Drink, pour up the whole seal (lean)
Momma, I made it like Mike Will (momma)
Trippin' I'm leanin' off 2 pills

[Verse 1]
Pull out the choppa advantage
I am a legend lil' bitch no Atlantis
The choppa do damage
You prayin' like mantis
The oppas they scramblin', like diamonds they dancin'
I bet you didn't know a lil' nigga could flow
I'll spend all of my dough and start whippin' that woah
And my diamonds still cold like that shit got some snow
Ice age on a hoe got me on Eskimo
Fuck a new wave nigga this a tsunami
You cannot be saved little bitch get up off a me
I'm the original, you just a wannabe
This game is physical
Why don't you watch and see
Best come correct like a porn star with aim
All of my niggas I cannot contain
To all of these rappers
Your shits just the same
If your losing money I guess I'm to blame
This shits just the start
They will be saying my name
I'm moving fast, better stay in your lane
Bitch I got heat in my brain
I cop ice in my veins
Momma said I'm insane (gang)

[Hook]
Pull out the choppa, do damage
Ride with the babies, no family (what)
I got the racks that they talk about (racks)
Stay in the trap imma break a pot (break a pot)
Rollie water, real deal (rollie)
Drink, pour up the whole seal (lean)
Momma, I made it like Mike Will (momma)
Trippin' I'm leanin' off 2 pills
Pull out the choppa, do damage
Ride with the babies, no family (what)
I got the racks that they talk about (racks)
Stay in the trap imma break a pot (break a pot)
Rollie water, real deal (rollie)
Drink, pour up the whole seal (lean)
Momma, I made it like Mike Will (momma)
Trippin' I'm leanin' off 2 pills
