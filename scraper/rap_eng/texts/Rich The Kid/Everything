[Chorus: Rich The Kid]
I make your bitch roll up my Swishers, your bitch wash all my dishes
Your bitch pick up my pack, boy, I send her on a mission
Your bitch do everything, your bitch do everything
Your bitch do everything, I make your bitch do everything
I make your bitch roll up my Swishers, your bitch wash all my dishes
Your bitch pick up my pack, boy, I put her on a mission
Your bitch do everything, your bitch do everything
Your bitch do everything, I make your bitch do everything

[Verse 1: Rich The Kid]
Oh, she a slut, she a dog, she a freaky ass bitch
But she rollin' up the kush, and then she suckin' on my dick
I'm like, "bitch, please, hoe get out my face"
Why the fuck you in my house? Bitch, get out my place
First, she wash the dishes, then pick up my pack
First, she suckin' on my dick, lickin' on my sack
I'm like, "hoe, where the fuck your man?"
All up in the pussy and I be goin' HAM
I got racks on racks on racks on racks, bitch, I got the stupid packs
Blowin' on that kush, that loud, catch me in that fuckin' cloud
Your bitch do everybody, your bitch at every party
She roll that kush, she suck that dick, and then she pop a molly

[Chorus: Rich The Kid]
I make your bitch roll up my Swishers, your bitch wash all my dishes
Your bitch pick up my pack, boy, I send her on a mission
Your bitch do everything, your bitch do everything
Your bitch do everything, I make your bitch do everything
I make your bitch roll up my Swishers, your bitch wash all my dishes
Your bitch pick up my pack, boy, I put her on a mission
Your bitch do everything, your bitch do everything
Your bitch do everything, I make your bitch do everything

[Verse 2: Derez De'Shon]
Your bitch do whatever I tell her
And she eat what I feed her
Make your bitch feel special
Fuck the hoe, and then leave her
Your bitch say she love me
I tell her the same thing
Gotta beat the work in the jewelry store with my prisoner
Chain gang, couple bad bitches, a few plain janes
Now your bitch my main thing, and then we young niggas like Chief Keef
We don't cuff a hoe, we bang bang
It's Rich The Kid and D Dash, better get your hoe 'fore we take her home
Fuck her like she a porn star, and then drop her off with you later
Oh, Dash

[Chorus: Rich The Kid]
I make your bitch roll up my Swishers, your bitch wash all my dishes
Your bitch pick up my pack, boy, I send her on a mission
Your bitch do everything, your bitch do everything
Your bitch do everything, I make your bitch do everything
I make your bitch roll up my Swishers, your bitch wash all my dishes
Your bitch pick up my pack, boy, I put her on a mission
Your bitch do everything, your bitch do everything
Your bitch do everything, I make your bitch do everything
