[Hook: Rich The Kid]
I'm that nigga she could spend them bands with
Look at all these rings, I won the championship
Running with the check like I got Nikes on
Baby told me please put down that Styrofoam
I'm that nigga she could spend them bands with
Look at all these rings, I won the championship
Running with the cheque like I got Nikes on
Baby told me please put down that Styrofoam

[Verse 1]
Sippin' on the drank, I'm looking like I'm sleep
Switching bitches and they kissin', I'm in love with freaks
Look at my neck, wet, I got to flex
The king was never at school, I ran up a check
Been trapping the same spot
I dropped a Benz on a watch
Bitch gon' suck it or not, still got the dope in my sock
I made a mill with that same wrist
Niggas gon' hate and it don't mean shit
Drinking the cup with the Actavis
My little niggas strapped like a terrorist
Since I got the cheque, I had to ball on 'em
You say you got the shooters, you can't call on 'em
Bitch I know you broke so you gonna run your mouth
Play with me, I pop up at your momma house

[Hook: Rich The Kid]
I'm that nigga she could spend them bands with
Look at all these rings, I won the championship
Running with the check like I got Nikes on
Baby told me please put down that Styrofoam
I'm that nigga she could spend them bands with
Look at all these rings, I won the championship
Running with the cheque like I got Nikes on
Baby told me please put down that Styrofoam

[Verse 2]
I'm addicted please dont play me bout my paper
Need a check or imma turn into the Terminator
Thats your wife but she gon suck me in the bathroom
12 hatin I got racks and them tattoos [?] I got that gas and that drank on me
