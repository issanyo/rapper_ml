Mike WiLL Made-It

[Verse 1: Rich The Kid]
Jump out the Bentley, bitch (skrr)
I drop a house on my necklace (what?)
I drop a Benz on my wrist, bitch (huuh)
She want a bed, I can buy it (lil bitch!)
I'm teachin' a lesson (a lesson)
I got the job, professor of flexin' (flex)
I got a confection
I won't be broke, I got me a Bentley (skrr)
I'm in love with hundreds, I'm in love with guala
She can get some dick tonight, can get no prada
I'm a player, can call her tomorrow (tomorrow)
Freezer on me nigga I got too much water
Player with the check (a check), pinky ring wet
Y'all wanna see me shine, put the diamonds on my neck (what?)
All type of reckless my necklace (my necklace)
I block her call, she keeps texting

[Chorus: Swae Lee]
Jump in the Pegasus
All kinda reckless the necklace
All kinda reckless I flexed it
K-keep the change, yeah you heard me correctly
If she sleek and foreign, call her Lexus
Every week a foreign, I just check her wishlist
Only thing I'm here for is perplexin'
Caterpillar whip and I lowered it

[Verse 2: Slim Jxmmi]
Lil' Jxm', I got a problem
I'm in love with money, I'm in love with ballin'
Gotta keep my phone on vibrate, how these bitches callin'
Neiman Marcus' shawty and I ain't window shoppin'
2K on my feet, yeah, 2K, I be kickin' game
Bubble Gum OG, I'm smokin' on a different strain
Niggas stealin' sauce, they need to stay up in their lane
Baby, we on top and that ain't ever gonna change
Put you boys to shame
Pull them foreign's out
And put you boys to shame
Going hard on a bitch like Major Payne
Say my name (Jxm')
They ain't know how to spell it, so I put it on my chain

[Chorus: Swae Lee]
Jump in the Pegasus
All kinda reckless the necklace
All kinda reckless I flexed it
K-keep the change, yeah you heard me correctly
If she sleek and foreign, call her Lexus
Every week a foreign, I just check her wishlist
Only thing I'm here for is perplexin'
Caterpillar whip and I lowered it

[Verse 3: Swae Lee]
All these, hundreds got me siftin'
G35, needs a liftkit
Man dirty cup I'm grippin' I mean it's a pig pen
Leave your chick within five feet of me, wouldnâ€™t risk it
Niggas cannot stop me, told 'em just to face it
Aston sittin' low (lower), damn I scraped it
She like "spread your wings, 'cause it's the Pegasus"
I'm like "I might go and take the spot, because of negligence"
Oh, barricades ain't holdin' me
Money on me, but that ain't controllin' me
Last night had bitches bogin' me, like they go at me?
Took off on these niggas, caught a JetStream

[Chorus: Swae Lee & Slim Jxmmi]
Jump in the Pegasus
All kinda reckless the necklace (yeah)
All kinda reckless I flexed it (yeah)
K-keep the change, yeah, you heard me correctly
If she sleek and foreign, call her Lexus
Every week a foreign, I just check her wishlist (yeah)
Only thing I'm here for is perplexing (yeah)
Caterpillar whip and I lowered it (yeah)
