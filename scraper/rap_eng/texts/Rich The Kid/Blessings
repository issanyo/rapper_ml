[Hook]
I had to learn a lesson, lose it all in a second
I made it here that's the blessing, get the money not stressin'
You better count yo' blessings, you better count yo' blessings
You better count yo' blessings, you better count yo' blessings
I had to learn a lesson, lose it all in a second
I made it here that's the blessing, get the money not stressin'
You better count yo' blessings, you better count yo' blessings
You better count yo' blessings, you better count yo' blessings

[Verse 1]
Thankin' God for the breakfast
Pockets stuffed I got extras
Your own friends they'll hate you
Play a bitch like a Sega
Gotta thank God for the dinner
Neck on froze like the winter
Broke niggas still runnin' they mouth
Back then used to break in the house
Look what these bitches a do
Niggas hatin' on me too
Know they see me in the coupe
You better count yo' blessings
I had to learn a lesson
Bet she gon' call on me
These bitches is all on me
Can't forget about the struggle
In the streets gotta get it ya hustle
Walkin' red bottoms flexin' the muscle
Yeah I gotta get it regardless
Red bag bih run like a Harley
In the kitchen I'ma whip it the hardest
Bring it back to the trap where it started

[Hook]
I had to learn a lesson, lose it all in a second
I made it here that's the blessing, get the money not stressin'
You better count yo' blessings, you better count yo' blessings
You better count yo' blessings, you better count yo' blessings
I had to learn a lesson, lose it all in a second
I made it here that's the blessing, get the money not stressin'
You better count yo' blessings, you better count yo' blessings
You better count yo' blessings, you better count yo' blessings

[Verse 2]
I was jugging in a Lexus
Bitches switch up in a second
I pull up in a i8, she blowin' up my i7
Yeah my red bottoms drippin' the wrong way
Thank God for a new day
Goyard on the suitcase
I'm in her mouth like toothpaste
Workin' hard and I'm flexin'
Big diamonds on my necklace
Yo' boyfriend he drivin' a Lexus
I stack the money like Tetris
Fuck her one time and it's over shit
She jumped in my sofa
She thick so I'm bendin' it over
Yea, I like to trap with the bakin' soda
Get it out the dirt
You can make it but you gotta work
Puttin' money in my grandma purse
She pray for me sunday at church
Say a prayer shoutout to my haters
Workin' hard I got new paper
My hoes be comin' in flavors
I told that bitch I'm a player

[Hook]
I had to learn a lesson, lose it all in a second
I made it here that's the blessing, get the money not stressin'
You better count yo' blessings, you better count yo' blessings
You better count yo' blessings, you better count yo' blessings
I had to learn a lesson, lose it all in a second
I made it here that's the blessing, get the money not stressin'
You better count yo' blessings, you better count yo' blessings
You better count yo' blessings, you better count yo' blessings
