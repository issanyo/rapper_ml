[Chorus: Rich The Kid]
Say she wanna do it for a bankroll
Pull up to the trap at the back door
Ain't tryna see them clothes on no more
Baby just do it for a bankroll
Say she wanna do it for a bankroll
Pull up to the trap at the back door
Ain't tryna see them clothes on no more
Baby just do it for a bankroll

[Post-Chorus: Rich The Kid]
Bankroll, bankroll, bankroll
Bankroll, bankroll, bankroll
Got a blue bankroll, my money don't fold
I bet you she'll do it for the bankroll
Bankroll, bankroll, bankroll
Bankroll, bankroll, bankroll
Got a blue bankroll, my money don't fold
I bet you she'll do it for the bankroll

[Verse 1: Rich Chigga]
Yeah, uh
Bankroll city pay slow
Everybody on the payroll under control
Every twenty minutes change clothes
Shout out my boy Post only that
You wanna say go if you say so, uh
Run up in the scene in my tight jean shorts
Looking like a pimp but I got one hoe
Try to shut me up and I say hell no
Never switching up, only switch up flows
Bling blau, honey on the carousel
She get looking at me now
And she hit me when in town
She thirsty like she in a drought
Does she want to fuck no doubt
Living life like a king
I ain't even got a crown, ay
Hundred bands, hundred bands
Hold up bitch I got hundred thousand in my pillow case
You can try me run it with the Nike
But you'll never do it in my pace
Hundred racks, hundred racks
Hold up hoe, this is my first time in the States
My aura so bright but my bars so dark
You would think you in the Sunken Place

[Chorus: Rich The Kid]
Say she wanna do it for a bankroll
Pull up to the trap at the back door
Ain't tryna see them clothes on no more
Baby just do it for a bankroll
Say she wanna do it for a bankroll
Pull up to the trap at the back door
Ain't tryna see them clothes on no more
Baby just do it for a bankroll

[Post-Chorus: Rich The Kid]
Bankroll, bankroll, bankroll
Bankroll, bankroll, bankroll
Got a blue bankroll, my money don't fold
I bet you she'll do it for the bankroll
Bankroll, bankroll, bankroll
Bankroll, bankroll, bankroll
Got a blue bankroll, my money don't fold
I bet you she'll do it for the bankroll

[Verse 2: Rich The Kid]
Walk in with a pocket full of broccoli
Bitch, I'm rich like I hit the fuckin' lottery (what!?)
Started in the trap with an elbow (elbow)
Hit a split on the dick for a bankroll
I was ridin' in a Masi, me and Diplo
Tell your bitch get low like a '64
I don't play no games, Nintendo
Rollie cost a bird, hold it out the window (brrrr)
I'ma make it flip like Skippa (Skippa)
Got a freak every week, I can't kiss her
Red and white Lamb' like a peppermint
Bankroll in each pocket, bitch I'm hella rich (bankroll)
Ain't tryna see them clothes on no more
Your boyfriend cuffin' you like po-po (12)
Pour some more Act, movin' slow-mo
You ain't got the bankroll it's a no go

[Chorus: Rich The Kid]
Say she wanna do it for a bankroll
Pull up to the trap at the back door
Ain't tryna see them clothes on no more
Baby just do it for a bankroll
Say she wanna do it for a bankroll
Pull up to the trap at the back door
Ain't tryna see them clothes on no more
Baby just do it for a bankroll

[Post-Chorus: Rich The Kid]
Bankroll, bankroll, bankroll
Bankroll, bankroll, bankroll
Got a blue bankroll, my money don't fold
I bet you she'll do it for the bankroll
Bankroll, bankroll, bankroll
Bankroll, bankroll, bankroll
Got a blue bankroll, my money don't fold
I bet you she'll do it for the bankroll

[Verse 3: Young Thug]
Pardon me, I'm just ballin' over from the sideline
Pardon your bitch, she ain't watchin' me, I'm going primetime
Rich nigga shit
Bet the bitch'll jump on a nigga dick (bet the bitch'll do it)
Rich nigga shit, bet the bitch I'll jump on her clit
Drop the soap with her
She wet like a boat with her
I'ma wet her up like a cold killer (brrrrr)
Thugger Thugger the cold nigga
I done flipped a bird
Then I saw the bitch pat right down on her
And I've been rich for the last five years
No I cannot pipe down

[Chorus: Rich The Kid]
Say she wanna do it for a bankroll
Pull up to the trap at the back door
Ain't tryna see them clothes on no more
Baby just do it for a bankroll
Say she wanna do it for a bankroll
Pull up to the trap at the back door
Ain't tryna see them clothes on no more
Baby just do it for a bankroll
