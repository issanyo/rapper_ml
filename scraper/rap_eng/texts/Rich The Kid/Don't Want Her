[Intro]
Ya, I don't want that bitch cuz she garb'
Ya, I just wanted this s' look faster
Ya, you know what I'm s...

[Hook]
Shout out my new bitch, she perfect
Trap still jumpin' like Kermit
Flexin', I'm makin' 'em vomit
The Rollie is water, it came out the faucet
I put a M in my closet
Racks cannot fit in my wallet
The money is comin', can't stop it
I don't want that bitch 'cuz she garbage
Shout out my new bitch, she perfect
Trap still jumpin' like Kermit
Flexin', I'm makin' 'em vomit
The Rollie is water, it came out the faucet
I put a M in my closet
Racks cannot fit in my wallet
The money is comin', can't stop it
I don't want that bitch 'cuz she garbage

[Verse 1]
I don't want that bitch 'cuz she garbage
I'mma hit ya ho and then I give it back
Married to the money, all these rings have an ice attack
"Flexin' on Purpose", thought a nigga had a six-pack
Money on my mind, I was thinkin' 'bout a hundred racks
Lil thot gimme top ice in my wrist watch
Oh my mother, I won't love her, can't trust her
Broke rappers on Fake Watch Busters
Kissed a hoe in the mouth while she suck it (urgh)
Your chain came out the mall now you busted (whoop!)
Call me the goat
Too much lean, gotta pour up a fo'
I don't want that bitch 'cuz she garbage
Fucking ho's off the runway, models
Diamond's water, like they came out damn faucet
You was winnin', had a soul but you lost it
Nigga they tryna be me
Give a fuck about a bitch, run your money up
I got a foreign, I just make her count it
I know my business don't need no accountant
Niggas are the poor, fuck these niggas I ain't tryna be cool
Grow bad money, got bands like a fo' (hunnids)
I'mma count hundreds, I ain't think about you

[Hook]
Shout out my new bitch, she perfect
Trap still jumpin' like Kermit
Flexin', I'm makin' 'em vomit
The Rollie is water, it came out the faucet
I put a M in my closet
Racks cannot fit in my wallet
The money is comin', can't stop it
I don't want that bitch 'cuz she garbage
Shout out my new bitch, she perfect
Trap still jumpin' like Kermit
Flexin', I'm makin' 'em vomit
The Rollie is water, it came out the faucet
I put a M in my closet
Racks cannot fit in my wallet
The money is comin', can't stop it
I don't want that bitch 'cuz she garbage

[Verse 2]
Keep on winning, got to flex up
Walk with a Mac better back up
Ain't stressin' no bitch, I'm a player
Fucking and I leave, I can't buy you no hair
Cut her off, where the scizors
Countin' money, get a splinter
Neck froze like the winner
Came from the bottom, gotta flex up
Just seen a hundred gotta let em' keep callin'
Kermit trap still jumpin' I'm ballin'
Take her home, I'mma fuck till the morning
Walk around with a hundred, it's on me
Wake up I need some more Benjamins
Cash a check, yeah datway
Countin' money, get a headache
Rich Forever, I'm in Beverly
I was grindin', had to get it, now I'm flexin' really
You can't see round no nigga that ain't got a milli
You savin' these hoes put yo cape on
I'm on the way tell her pick up the phone
Shoutout my new bitch, December she cold
Count a quarter milli, now I'm flexin', you broke

[Hook]
Shout out my new bitch, she perfect
Trap still jumpin' like Kermit
Flexin', I'm makin' 'em vomit
The Rollie is water, it came out the faucet
I put a M in my closet
Racks cannot fit in my wallet
The money is comin', can't stop it
I don't want that bitch 'cuz she garbage
Shout out my new bitch, she perfect
Trap still jumpin' like Kermit
Flexin', I'm makin' 'em vomit
The Rollie is water, it came out the faucet
I put a M in my closet
Racks cannot fit in my wallet
The money is comin', can't stop it
I don't want that bitch 'cuz she garbage
