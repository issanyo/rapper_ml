[Hook: Jaden Smith & Rich The Kid]
I’ma jump in it like this
I don’t party with the kids
I get lit and I sit at the crib
You my baby, no bib
I’ma jump in it like this
All I want is the neck
Dive up in it, she wet
Woke up, dreaming ‘bout a TEC
She be my girl from the city
She got a body like Nicki
She put a scratch on the whip
Baby I'll fix it, no biggie
Gotta hit it two times
Gotta cuff her, it's a crime
Bust it open, now it's mine
Put my life up on the line
Swimmin', I'm swimmin', I'm swimmin', I'm swimmin', I'm swimmin', I'm swimmin'
I roller coaster through the women
They lay their back up on the linen
Yo me and Richy 'bout to get it
They ain't even see it coming
I was broke, turned nothing to something
Maserati in my pocket, just stuntin'
Let me hit it, change my name to McLovin

[Verse 1: Rich The Kid]
Trappin' out a mansion
Made a million dollars, now my diamonds dancing
I was thinkin' 'bout a check
Fuck your bitch, I got her wet
Rich forever, got a deal
Motherfuck how you feel
Fucking a ho out in Calabasas
Spitting the fire like a fuckin' dragon
Why they want to see me broke
Took your bitch and now she broke
I was trappin', selling dope
Double G on the coat
Doors go up on the Tesla
Young nigga, I flex like a wrestler
Kill the pussy, put it on a stretcher
I get geeked like professors
Spending that check and I'm winning
I get head in the Bentley
Ridin' 'round with a semi
I got cheese like the dentist
I'ma jump in it like this
I'ma go- I'ma go dive in a bitch
I'm finally rich
Want a model, take a pick

[Verse 2: Rich The Kid]
Let me hit it, let me hit it
I can't cuff her, let me flip it
I'ma pass the ho to Jaden
I'ma fuck her if she taken
Walkin' around like a boss
I made me a mill, I'm a boss
This Chanel, no Lacoste
I'ma flex like fuck the cost
Hit from the back then she suck it
She call me daddy, I'm bussin'
Nothin' but money I'm cuffin'
Cook a pot on the oven
Me and Jaden on the hills
Skateboarding, shit for real
I'ma tell you what it is
They was hating on me still
I just might pull out her hair
Freak bitch, no underwear
Sit on my dick like a chair
I can make it anywhere
I was rackin', they was sleepin'
Made a hundred for the weekend
I been preaching like a deacon
You better listen when I'm speaking
