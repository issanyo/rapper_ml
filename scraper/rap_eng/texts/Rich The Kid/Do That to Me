[Verse 1: Tasha Catour]
Ooh, ooh, oh yeah
Ooh, ooh
You said that you'd love her
Told her you would put no one above her
You told her that your love would always last forever
No matter what, you and her would always be together, together
Told her you wouldn't lie
You'd never do anything to make her cry
So I can't understand why you all in my face now
I can see right through you, right through you

[Chorus: Tasha Catour &  Rich The Kid]
You would cheat on her
What's to say that you won't do that to me?
Just to be in my world
What's to say that you won't do that to me, to me, to me, to me?
You won't do that to me, to me, to me, to me
You said you love her (I did, though, not no more)
What's to say that you won't do that to me?

[Verse 2: Rich The Kid]
Why you trippin' on a bitch that I ain't even fuckin' with?
I got tired of her shit (yuh), so you know I had to split (yeah)
Girl, I'm really fuckin' with you, I ain't even gotta flex (nah)
Why you talkin' 'bout my ex (yeah)? She goes chasin' after checks (yeah, yeah)
Hold up, why you stressin' me (why)? Askin' me through textin' me (yeah)
Goin' through my phone while I sleep, you be testin' me (ooh)
You got trust issues (whoa), but I still fuck with you (whoa)
I ain't lyin', girl (yeah), I'm really in love with you (yeah, yeah)

[Chorus: Tasha Catour]
You would cheat on her
What's to say that you won't do that to me?
Just to be in my world
What's to say that you won't do that to me, to me, to me, to me?
You won't do that to me, to me, to me, to me
You said you love her
What's to say that you won't do that to me?

[Verse 3: Rich The Kid]
I ain't gotta flex to you (nah)
Shawty, what you tryna do? (yeah)
Lookin' for a man, but you got one here right next to you (yeah)
You be in the club lookin' for love with you girlfriends
I ain't tryna just make you my girl, but my best friend
I ain't a cheater, though (nah)
How you believe the hoe?
She was a trick, she was a bitch, I had to leave the hoe
She be flexin' to her friends 'bout her check (yeah), but she broke as fuck (yeah, yeah)
Tellin' people we together (what), but we really broken up (what)

[Chorus: Tasha Catour]
You would cheat on her
What's to say that you won't do that to me?
Just to be in my world
What's to say that you won't do that to me, to me, to me, to me?
You won't do that to me, to me, to me, to me
You said you love her
What's to say that you won't do that to me?
