Hey!(hey!)
Aye!(aye!)

[Chorus: Jay Critch]
I gotta smoke up the onion
Cookie beat a nigga head, concussion (cookie beating my ass)
I just be talkin' that money, me and the bread be havin' discussions (I just be talkin' that bread)
I made moves she ain't want me
VVS's on me now the bitch bustin' (hey!)
I had to hit me a lick (jug)
You thought it was lean, but it was the 'tussin (jug)
Thought it was
She goin' through the gang, all of us (all of us)
She off a Xan, party bus (hey!)
Shooters in the cut don't start 'em up (brrow)
Pull up to the spot shoot the party up (brrow)
My pockets was low but I got 'em up (got 'em up)
My niggas on go, ain't no stopping us (stopping us)
I got me some dough now she poppin' up (poppin' up)
I pour me a 4 of pineapple crush (yeah)

[Verse: 1 Jay Critch]
I pour me a 3 in a peach crush (in a peach crush)
She sip on my lean now she geek'd up (now she geek'd up)
The girl of your dreams is an eater (is a eater)
Rocket on me nigga don't try to sneak up (don't try to sneak up)
Too boring, why she think that i need her?
Two foreigns bitch need me a visa (two foreigns)
She staring like she Mona Lisa (hey!)
Ice glaring came out of the freezer
Diamonds fighting like Goku and Frieza (Goku and Frieza)
No shawty I don't want you, I need ya (want you, i need ya)
How you ballin see you up in the bleachers (up in the bleachers)
Imma hit a stain, my niggas they bleach up (jug)
LV put it all on my sneakers
[?] smokin' all the best reefer (hey!)
In the ghost lookin' like the grim reaper
On the road, she give brain like teacher (brain like teacher)

[Chorus: Jay Critch]
I gotta smoke up the onion
Cookie beat a nigga head, concussion (cookie beating my ass)
I just be talkin' that money, me and the bread be havin' discussions (I just be talkin' that bread)
I made moves she ain't want me
VVS's on me now the bitch bustin' (hey!)
I had to hit me a lick
You thought it was lean, but it was the 'tussin (jug)
Thought it was
She goin' through the gang, all of us (all of us)
She off a Xan, party bus (party bus)
Shooters in the cut don't start 'em up (don't star 'em up)
Pull up to the spot shoot the party up (party up)
My pockets was low but i got 'em up (but i got 'em up)
My niggas on go, ain't no stopping us (stopping us)
I got me some dough now she poppin' up (hey!)
I pour me a 4 of pineapple crush

[Verse: 2 Rich the Kid]
Pour a 4 down in the big blue (what)
Ice on me like a fucking igloo (ice)
Big dog nigga no blues clues (big dog)
Bring your bitch imma give her back too (bitch)
Oo, rappers they broke and they salty
Lean in the morning like coffee (lean)
She got a Birkin, she bossin'
My neck is so wet like a faucet
Niggas on the internet flexin' (flex)
Lookin' at my pockets they pregnant
I just might pull out the Bentley (skrt)
Now that I'm worth a few milli (huh)
In the kitchen but the stove broke
I was hustlin' for a bank roll
Blue cheese all hundo's (blue)
She on her back like camel (bitch)

[Chorus: Jay Critch]
I gotta smoke up the onion
Cookie beat a nigga head, concussion (cookie beating my ass)
I just be talkin' that money, me and the bread be havin' discussions (I just be talkin' that bread)
I made moves she ain't want me
VVS's on me now the bitch bustin' (hey!)
I had to hit me a lick (jug)
You thought it was lean, but it was the 'tussin (jug)
Thought it was
She goin' through the gang, all of us (all of us)
She off a xan, party bus (hey!)
Shooters in the cut don't start 'em up (brrow)

My pockets was low but i got 'em up (but i got 'em up)
My niggas on go, ain't no stopping us (stopping us)
I got me some dough now she poppin' up (poppin' up)
I pour me a 4 of pineapple crush (yeah)
