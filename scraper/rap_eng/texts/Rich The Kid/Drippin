Baby girl like the ocean (like the ocean)
Deep sea when I'm stroking (deep sea)

[Verse 1: Rich The Kid]
All my cars, all my broads, they exotic (it's exotic)
Pussy drippin', I might take her out the tropics (out the tropics)
If she bad, I might fuck her in a 'rari (in a 'rari)
That's your girl (that's your girl), I'm not sorry (no, no)
She too bougie you can tell (you can tell)
All she think 'bout is Chanel (is Chanel)
But that pussy so wet, I can sail (I can sail)
You gon' put her in jail (yeah, yeah)

[Verse 2: Chris Brown]
Water, sauce drippin doin' backflips
And when I dick her down, .45 in the mattress
You ain't gon' catch me slippin' in no traffic
Fuck a Uber, brought the shooters
I'm icy than a bitch, I'm freezin' bad
Water, all of these hunnids, baby, I know you need 'em bad (cash)
And it don't matter if I lose, I get it right back
Girl, just throw it right back
Niggas be petty, oh, when they ain't on yo level, no
So I pop the trunk on the Chevy
I gotta send they ass straight to the devil, so
Water, wa-wa-water

[Chorus: Rich The Kid & Chris Brown]
Baby girl like the ocean (like the ocean)
Deep sea when I'm stroking (deep sea)

Pull up in it, oh, I'ma pull it out (I'ma pull it out)
Pussy good, need that shit like every time, huh
