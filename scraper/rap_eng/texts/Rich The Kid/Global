[Hook]
Hundred bottles, VIP, flexing
Bought ‘em all for the whole dough
Popped a pint, had to pour four
Need a check or it’s no go
Them ain’t real deal diamonds, you flexing
Fuck around, went global
Bad bitch from Soho
Hundred bands or no show
You ain’t never had a check, you flexing
Y’all niggas still broke though
Rich nigga getting more dough
Free my niggas, fuck po-po
You ain’t never had a check, stop flexing
You niggas still broke though
Rich nigga getting more dough
Fuck around and went global

[Verse 1]
You ain’t never had a check, stop flexing
Poppin’ real deal pints out of Texas
Got a bitch I’m fuck, no texting
Got a whole lot of money, I’m flexing
That’s your ho, bend her over with the heels on
My trap still jumping, got ten phones
Motorola, I ain’t trapping off an iPhone
Need a Bentley, young nigga get your roll on
Ride around with the bands in the trunk and the Louis bag
I can’t fuck with a broke bitch
In the kitchen whipping so damn hard
I fuck around and got broke wrists
100 bottles for the bitches, gon’ flex
Rolls Royce, we ain’t riding no Lexus
Walk around, my pockets look pregnant
She gon’ suck it, then send her to the exit

[Hook]

Free my niggas, fuck po-po
You ain’t never had a check, stop flexing
You niggas still broke though
Rich nigga getting more dough
Fuck around and went global

[Verse 2]
I could send a brick through the e-mail
Move this trap, got a new scale
On the north side like [?]
From the bando to the fishscale
I be running up the money, got a beeper on me
I was still getting paper, they was sleeping on me
Walk around, blue money, got to keep it on me
I got old money, I ain’t going broke
You ain’t ever had a check, stop flexing
Rich The Kid chain water, and the necklace
I can tell a bad bitch anything
Batman Lambo, Bruce Wayne
Say you want nigga, they gon’ pull up
32 choppers in a black truck
Rich nigga walking ‘round, flexed up
Riding in the Bentley with the doors up
