[Hook: MPA Duke]
Pop a Hunnid bottles in the club nigga turn it (turn it)
And we flexing on purpose nigga
Serving that shit to who ever want it
Run up that money I bought me a loft and a house
I get that shit in and get it out
Two or three K's in my trap house
4 ring matte black Audi
No I'm not talking no Master P
I run with some niggas that bout it
But we trapping with endurance
Try me you gone need insurance
Not a convicted felon but I'm running felons that'll bust your melon
Niggas be acting so hard
But they telling like DTE Trouble I'm ready

[Verse One: MPA Duke]
Cook up a 31 I need some ready
(???) Free the Guwop what I'm telling ya we are together not separate
Take all the extra I bout me a Tesla
These niggas broke like the levy

Why these niggas act like they having
Throw me a bomb I'm going Flippa McFadden
Just booted up and I'm high as Aladdin

Preach to the hood like a pastor
Popping these percs and they get me high faster
