[Hook]
So many racks like the bank
Passed out, I just poured out the pint
Walk in the trap and it stank
I told that bitch cut on the sink
So many racks like the bank
Passed out on the four out the pint
Walk in the trap and it stank
I told that bitch cut on the sink

[Verse 1]
Told mama I would be rich forever
Now I’m riding in a Masi, rich forever
Niggas hating then I bought a bigger bezel
I be staying on the stove like a kettle
Play with the keys like Zaytoven
In the trap, wrists moving, J’s smoking
She from overseas, Rolex get away
Maybach pull up, get in it
Let your main bitch fuck and then I drop her off
In the Goyard ballin’, no basketball
Fuck 12, said a nigga free Gucci
Have your bitch wipe me down like Boosie
I be in Hollywood swerving
Like the president, back of the Suburban
They been hating on me but I run it up
Everybody been waiting on the Trap Talk
I broke my wrist, 360
This bitch so hot, saddity
You was just mad ‘til you fell off
I was getting money out in New York
Fucking your bitch, then I leave her
I had to trap out the Beamer
I’m talking the trap out your speakers
Bust in your bitch like a desert eagle
