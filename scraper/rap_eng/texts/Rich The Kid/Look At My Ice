[Intro]
That's right, I gotta take 'em off man. Cause there's only one, and that's me. You understand? For all the fightin' you understand? Sucker thing he good, sucker think he want me I know he can't

[Hook: Trill Sammy]
Look at my ice, yeah, you can't help but stare
Spend a lot on these Margielas, yeah, 1500 for a pair
While I'm laughin' to the bank though
Sippin' drank though
We smoke OG not no mango with your main ho
Look at my bitch, yeah, you can't help but stare
Spent a lot on her Burkin bag, now she gon' keep it real
While I'm laughin' to the bank though, smokin' dank though
Diamonds dancin', we can tango, you see my chain glow

[Verse 1: Trill Sammy]
Diamonds dancin' like Chris
I got a white bitch, she rich
But I think she really want Rich
She not never get no kiss
I'm kickin' her out, she can't stay (like Martin)
I swear I'm in love with her face
I'm movin' them packs in the Bay
I (?) these niggas don't (?) stay
You lovin' that bitch, she's a thot
Just look at my diamonds, my watch, I'm lovin' her top
You see the Margielas I cop, I'm drivin' it straight off the lot
Early mornin' get the paper, made 100 bands off rappin'
Only 18, how that happen?
But I'ma flex and throw all that back

The trapper was dyin' but we gave it life
With a Rollie pure ice and a (?) look like rice
The Beemer cost 140, let's be precise
So many chains like I just hit a heist
Big money bag when I walk in the bank
We stand ready so I bought me a tank
Flew to Germany to get some new paint
I be stuntin', and I do what you can't
I pay a rack for some regular shoes
2500 I spent for the Loubes
She don't fuck with me cause she say that I'm rude
And I do what I want because I made my own rules
