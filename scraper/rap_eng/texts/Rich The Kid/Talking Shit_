[Intro: Lil Yachty]
Yup, yup
30, you a fool for this one

[Verse 1: Lil Yachty]
Broke niggas still talkin' the loudest
When you doing bad, niggas the proudest
Need a deposit before the private
Too exclusive, you can't talk to my manager
AK chopstick, cock it back and I damage her
Back in high school had a bitch out in Banneker
Talkin' bout Stephanie used to [?] selling act to the felonies
I fuck [?] caucasian, ebony, indian, cinnamon
"Ain't fucking, come again", never heard that before
Bitch off the X she bout high as a acrophobia
Geeked off the shrooms, she swear she seen a UFO
Brother had bricks like an old house chimney
Walk in the crib, that's the gang house reminy
Back in college I was fairly odd like Timothy
Now I blew up like you mixed the wrong thing in chemistry
And I give a fuck if you into me, fuck the industry
These niggas fake, my young niggas slimeball with the drake Niggas said you sweet as hell like you cake
Eat it up, eat it up off the plate, nigga
And I been poppin' and these niggas got animosity
I can feel it in the air like Phil Collins
Got a stupid bitch, she like doing pills, call her Mary Poppins
I could give a fuck bout a rap nigga
I could give a fuck about a pump, pump, pump it up old ass rap nigga
Talking about how it ain't gon' last for a nigga
Just to keep it real, I made more money in the last two than you ever did
I'ma stay down with the same gang
...
[?] taste like kiwi
And I spent the guap on GP
Lil' Boat

[Verse 2: Rich The Kid]
What!
Huh, lemme talk my shit, huh
Lil' bitch, don't play with me niggas, they violent (lil' bitch!)
My shooter ain't talking, he silent (grrah)
I'm thinking 'bout buying a island
Ooh, I just bought the Maybach, I'm wildin' (ooh, yeah)
Nah, [?] for real
