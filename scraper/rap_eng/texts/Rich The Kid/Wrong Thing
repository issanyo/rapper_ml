[Chorus: Rich the Kid]
Got the Rolls Royce, it's a truck (It's a skrrt)
Got a half a million dollars in the cut (Half a what)
Got a lil' blonde bitch tryna fuck (tryna fuck)
All these hoes on me 'cause I ran it up (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
I just copped the skelly, it's a AP

Put some ice on her now she skating (Skating)
Yeah, she think I love her, it's the wrong thing (Wrong thing)
