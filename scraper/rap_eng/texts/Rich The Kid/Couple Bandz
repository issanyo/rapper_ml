[Intro]
Okay, a hundred on my neck, so yeah, my chain is on ridiculous
And Gucci on my wrist, so yeah, your bitch she just be lickin' this
I'm in the club, and I'm throwin' up them bands
You in the strip club, no money in yo' hands

[Chorus]
Fendi cost me couple bands
Louis cost me couple bands
Gucci cost me couple bands
Hit the club, and I'm throwin' up them bands

[Verse 1]
Okay, a hundred on my neck, so yeah, my chain is on ridiculous
And Gucci on my wrist, so yeah, your bitch she just be lickin' this
I'm in the club, and I'm throwin' up them bands
You in the strip club, no money in yo' hands
Rollie rose gold, bitch, it cost me, fifty bands
No, my name ain't Shawty Lo, but yeah, your bitch said I'm da man
You a broke nigga, you don't know nothin'
I'm a rich nigga, I be straight stuntin'

[Chorus]
Fendi cost me couple bands
Louis cost me couple bands
Gucci cost me couple bands
Hit the club, and I'm throwin' up them bands
Fendi cost me couple bands
Louis cost me couple bands
Gucci cost me couple bands
Hit the club, and I'm throwin' up them bands

[Verse 2]
I got them bands, racks, bitch, I'm throwin' the stacks
Hit the club with 'bout 50K 'cause I ain't got no max
I hit the strip club, and all these bitches run to me
'Cause I'm the big dog, and shit, y'all just a son to me
Okay, I'm thumbin' through the check with my eyes closed
Then I leave the fuckin' club with 'bout five hoes
Pull off in a 'Vette 'cause I got that check
On the way to the crib, I'mma get that neck

[Chorus]
Fendi cost me couple bands
Louis cost me couple bands
Gucci cost me couple bands
Hit the club, and I'm throwin' up them bands
Fendi cost me couple bands
Louis cost me couple bands
Gucci cost me couple bands
Hit the club, and I'm throwin' up them bands
