[Intro]
Squat made the beat
Go Grizzly
Huh?
You must be deaf
What, ayy

[Chorus]
She wanna drip a bit, I bought her some red bottoms (What?)
He wanna trust the bitch, she left him for more dollars (Bitch)
I wanna pour up a four of the lean, got more problems (Lean)
I cannot trip or slip, bitch I got more commas
You thought you was classy, my money gettin' ashy
Them hundreds is old, I’m doin' 'em nasty (Ayy)
Got chicken like Zaxby’s
I'm fuckin' with Keisha, I thought that was Cassie
I can't let her pass me (What?)
Got too many racks, I'm doin' 'em nasty
I'm doin’ ’em nasty, ew

[Verse 1]
Hundred fifty racks, doin' ’em nasty
Bought a Richard Mille, 200K, bougie and classy, bitch (What? bitch)
Drop 50K on her wrist, I'm on my shit (My shit)
'Nother quarter mil on a Bent, ooh (Skrrt)
Pull in the Porsche, flexin' exactly (Flex)
I want the bitch, I won’t let her pass me
I told Dex, we need more zeros on them checks (Huh?)
So we can flex, 100K, that's a bet (A bet, ayy ayy ayy)
Bend her over, I'ma do her nasty (Do her nasty)
She a freak, actin' like she classy (Classy)
Bend her over for the first time, call me daddy (Rich, ayy)
Bust a nut and I'ma send her home in a cabby (Yeah)

[Chorus]
She wanna drip a bit, I bought her some red bottoms (What?)
He wanna trust the bitch, she left him for more dollars (Bitch)
I wanna pour up a four of the lean, got more problems (Lean)
I cannot trip or slip, bitch I got more commas
You thought you was classy, my money gettin' ashy
Them hundreds is old, I'm doin' 'em nasty (Ayy)
Got chicken like Zaxby's
I'm fuckin' with Keisha, I thought that was Cassie
I can't let her pass me (What?)
Got too many racks, I'm doin' 'em nasty
I'm doin' 'em nasty, ooh ooh ooh, ew

[Verse 2]
Put a Birkin on her, now she classy now, ayy
It's an AP, I might bust it down, ooh
A Keisha or Cassie
In the attic, money gettin' so ashy
I fuck her, she happy (Huh?)
Freak bitch always tryna harass me
Pull up, my Bentley do donuts
Too much money, it don't fold up
I'm takin' bitches, put your hoes up
I'm smellin' like money, she holdin' her nose up
Lamborghini, hold the doors up
I was broke, now I'm froze up
Keep the money so closer
Fake diamonds, nigga no sir (Nah)
She wanna drip, bought her some new heels (New hills)
I wanna geek, I popped like two pills (Two pills)
That's your bitch (Bitch)
I fuck her, she roadkill (What?)
The titties is fake, but the ass real

[Chorus]
She wanna drip a bit, I bought her some red bottoms (What?)
He wanna trust the bitch, she left him for more dollars (Bitch)
I wanna pour up a four of the lean, got more problems (Lean)
I cannot trip or slip, bitch I got more commas
You thought you was classy, my money gettin' ashy
Them hundreds is old, I'm doin' 'em nasty (Ayy)
Got chicken like Zaxby's
I'm fuckin' with Keisha, I thought that was Cassie
I can't let her pass me (What?)
Got too many racks, I'm doin' 'em nasty
I'm doin' 'em nasty, ew
