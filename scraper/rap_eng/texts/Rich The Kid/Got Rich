I done got rich and I'm flexing
I got cake, they can hate
I can tell that you fake
So much ice, she could skate
I done got rich on these niggas
I cannot fuck with these niggas
Damn, my diamonds got bigger
Cut her off, no scissors
I done got rich and I'm flexing
I got cake, they can hate
I can tell that you fake
So much ice, she could skate
I done got rich on these niggas
I cannot fuck with these niggas
Damn, my diamonds got bigger
Cut her off, no scissors

[Verse 1]
Cut it off, can't trust em
Imma fuck her you love her
Yellow diamonds that's mustard
Fuck 12 can't cuff me
Momma said niggas gon hate on you
I took that bitch now I'm straight on you
I was 19 when i bought the coupe
Pull up to school with a missing roof (Skrrr)
I got that dab and they biting
Touch down on the plug like a Titan
Who got the ounces, I'm buying
You say that you got it you lying
I was always in trouble
Take the pot make it bubble
Got a hundred million dough
Jugg the plug that's a fumble
My nigga ballin' like 23
Fuck the plug, I'm the plug
I can get it out the mud
Chopper riding with the glove
Cut you off, cut you off
I'ma boss, take a loss
Touchdown, Randy Moss
Rich niggas gotta floss

[Hook]
I done got rich and I'm flexing
I got cake, they can hate
I can tell that you fake
So much ice, she could skate
I done got rich on these niggas
I cannot fuck with these niggas
Damn, my diamonds got bigger
Cut her off, no scissors
I done got rich and I'm flexing
I got cake, they can hate
I can tell that you fake
So much ice, she could skate
I done got rich on these niggas
I cannot fuck with these niggas
Damn, my diamonds got bigger
Cut her off, no scissors

[Verse 2]
Switch from the Ghost to the Mazi
Cut you off no scissors
Snakes in the grass with the venom
Eating that pussy for dinner
Told mama i'm moving to Hollywood
Half a mill for a Wraith
Bigger diamonds in the face
Bought a molly for the day
These niggas too fake can't trust em
In the chopper and a trunk i'll bust you
I'mma let you burn no Usher
Gotta 10 chains on like Busta
I done got rich and I flex
I got cake, they can hate
Bought a mansion on the lake
Bigger house, bigger safe
Lotta snakes in the grass
200 on the dash
I was trappin', sellin' bags
Run up on you with the mask
I done got rich now they hate on me
I left for my shooter a K on me
Fuck friends, just the money and me
Too many racks, pockets ugly

[Hook]
I done got rich and I'm flexing
I got cake, they can hate
I can tell that you fake
So much ice, she could skate
I done got rich on these niggas
I cannot fuck with these niggas
Damn, my diamonds got bigger
Cut her off, no scissors
I done got rich and I'm flexing
I got cake, they can hate
I can tell that you fake
So much ice, she could skate
I done got rich on these niggas
I cannot fuck with these niggas
Damn, my diamonds got bigger
Cut her off, no scissors
