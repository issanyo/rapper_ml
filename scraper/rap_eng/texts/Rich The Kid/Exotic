[Hook: Rich The Kid]
Pull up with the trunk in the front
Got Amsterdam kush in the blunt
Foreign bitch gonna buy what she want
Gucci louis we stunting’
Exotic, exotic, all my cars exotic
All my hoes exotic, everything exotic
Maserati got whips, got bo, take trips
Hundred bands on my neck ain’t shit
You ain’t never chased out on a lick

[Verse 1: Rich The Kid
6 rings on I’m Jordan, You tryna be Kobe
Stepped in the building your bitch trine know me
Versace so exotic you can’t find this in the store
I took a trip to coca rica picking up the dope
In the kitchen water whipping cooking white girl
I’m in the bed getting head from 2 white girls
I just touched a million dollars I ain’t 21

[Hook: Rich The Kid]
Pull up with the trunk in the front
Got Amsterdam kush in the blunt
Foreign bitch gonna buy what she want
Gucci louis we stunting’
Exotic, exotic, all my cars exotic
All my hoes exotic, everything exotic
Maserati got whips, got bo, take trips
Hundred bands on my neck ain't shit
You ain't never chased out on a lick

[Verse 2: Rich The Kid]
All white Lamborghini I’m stunting’
100 bands on my neck ain’t nothin’
Young rich nigga shit you a broke nigga
You can have your bitch broke I ain’t cuffin’
Bricks all white like George Bush
In the Masi’ blowing amsterdam kush
All my cars exotic I gotta start push
I don’t fuck with you, I fuck exotic bitches
I just came off the plane with 3 Korean bitches
Pull up with the trunk in the front
Ferragamo with the Bally imma stunt
Young rich nigga I could buy what I want

[Hook: Rich The Kid]
Pull up with the trunk in the front
Got Amsterdam kush in the blunt
Foreign bitch gonna buy what she want
Gucci louis we stunting’
Exotic, exotic, all my cars exotic
All my hoes exotic, everything exotic
Maserati got whips, got bo, take trips
Hundred bands on my neck ain’t shit
You ain’t never chased out on a lick
