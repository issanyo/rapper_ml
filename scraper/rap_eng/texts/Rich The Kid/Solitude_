[Verse]
I think that she lonely
Nah I'm trippin' I know that she lonely
The money is on me
Kick it with you don't fuck with no homies
Can't play with her heart
Chasing the paper can't keep us apart
Baby you smart, buy you a Bentley just push it to start
She just want my time, baby its back to the grind
All of the time you all on my mind, together we shine
Said she hurt she don't want no purse
