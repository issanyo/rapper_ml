[Hook]
At W, but nigga you was staying at Doubletree
I’m a young rich nigga, 100 bands on me
I could take your bitch, fly across the country
My niggas young niggas, with triggers
They ain’t scared to go on a frenzy
My pinky ring it cost me way more than your [?]
Feels good to be rich
I’m a young rich nigga, I’m a young rich nigga
Feels good to be rich
I’m a young rich nigga, I’m a young rich nigga
Feels good to be rich
I’m a young rich nigga, I’m a young rich nigga
You ain’t talking bout money, no cash
I can’t fuck with ya

[Verse 1]
I don’t know how I did it
[?] bitches that wouldn’t fuck with me
Now, pull up in a ‘rari, 24s [?] call up money
My paper real long like chips in the ground
Hard work pays off, nigga had to stay down
Imma ride for my niggas, I ain’t never gon lay down
Fuck what you’re talking bout
Young rich nigga, I’m walking round with the ice
Got to thank god cause he saved my life
Been through everything, it wasn’t right
Nigga I was robbing, hitting juugs all night
Young rich nigga, take your bitch, fly across the country
But your bank empty
Back then I was broke and my gas was on E
Now I’m rich, on free

[Hook]
At W, but nigga you was staying at Doubletree

You ain’t talking bout money, no cash

[Verse 2]
You ain’t talking bout money, ain’t speaking
Young rich nigga, buy all for the weekend
These hoes keep telling me that they love me, they must be geekin’
In the bitch by the Benjamins
In the kitchen counting up, and I’m just bout a million
Your bitch know I had jewel man
How you try to cuff her, you ain’t got no dividends
Red bottoms [?], got an OG gas bag and I’m getting served heavily
I ain’t even have a dollar, I was tryna [?]
Feels good to be rich, now my house underwater
And them bitches used to act like you know me
Trap jumping like Ginoubli
Two bitches trapping four, call it Kobe
Foreign bitch and she rolling up OG

You ain’t talking bout money, no cash
