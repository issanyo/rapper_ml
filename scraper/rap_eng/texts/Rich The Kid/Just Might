[Intro]
Hello? Trap
Hello? Trap
Woah, ayy

[Hook]
I just might just cum on her face
I just might just go buy the Wraith
I just might go to Japan
Overseas for the bands
I was broke, got a Lamb'
Pull up, bitches like damn
No credit card, that's a scam
Take the pot, I'm goin' HAM
I fucked that bitch in Givenchy
Walkin' around with a 50
I done got rich, money filthy
I'm in New York, call me Diddy
Look at my Rollie, the ice
Pussy so good, fuck her twice
Take the whole cake, fuck a slice
She ride this dick like a bike

[Verse 1]
I just might pour up a pint
I'm sippin' the dirty with Sprite
That's your bitch - fuck her twice
Walkin' round with the ice
I just might fly to Japan
I just woke up with the bands
Servin' the pussy out there
No I'm ballin' like the Cavs
Take the pot, Stephen Curry
Put your bitch in Burberry
Money trouble too scary
Me and money got married
Takin' the pussy, I beat it
You lovin' the pussy, you eat it
Broke nigga you funny
Ballin' all this money
I make her nut when I fuck her
She suck the dick like a sucker
I run the bitch like a trucker
I hit the bitch like I snuck her
I got the money, no pressure
Walkin' around with the extras
I put that bitch on a stretcher
Iâ€™m a professional flexer

[Hook]
I just might just cum on her face
I just might just go buy the Wraith
I just might go to Japan
Overseas for the bands

Pull up, bitches like damn
No credit card, that's a scam
Take the pot, I'm goin' HAM
I fucked that bitch in Givenchy
Walkin' around with a 50
I done got rich, money filthy
I'm in New York come in Diddy
Look at my Rollie, the ice
Pussy so good, fuck her twice
Take the whole cake, fuck a slice
She ride this dick like a bike

[Verse 2]
Racks bust out the Balmain
Fuckin' that bitch I don't kiss her
I pass the ho out to Flippa
She got ass like a stripper
Rolling now she geeked up, geeked up
Now I'm chargin' 50 racks for the feature
I'm ballin,' you all in the bleachers
I'm walkin' with salad like caesar
I had to run for the money
None of my niggas stay hungry
All of my niggas 100
I had the check that they wanted
I had to work for the spot
Now she drop it like it's hot
You a cuffer like a cop
Put a lock on a box
I hit a ho with a switch-a-roo
I fuck her aunt in my Jimmy Choos
I'm in the streets and a movie too
Shawty a foreign, she love the crew
I nut on her face
My chopper can't fit in my waist
I got out of jail, beat the case
I'm walkin' around with the K
