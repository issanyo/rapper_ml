[Hook]
Everything is expensive
Yeah this life is God pricey
Revenge is so costly
Tell me what would you pay

[Verse 1: Rich The Kid]
I was trapping I was lying to my mama
Niggas hating I was looking for a come up
What would you do for a rollie a bust down
The price of the fame is too much now
Taking trips on the bus when I was jacked
Real niggas they'll die about respect
Back then I was broke now I flex
Pull up in a Bentley or Maybach
The rari I ride in Miami
I promise you won't understand me
I gotta provide for my family
Thanking the lord for the Benji's
Everybody wanna be a rich nigga
In the mall bad bitches take pictures
I don't trust no hoe can't kiss her
I was born , my wrist go get it
The fact that I'm rich but grind forever
Look at the rollie its presidential
Came in the game for the gold medal
Walking around with a gold bezel
What would you do for the millions
They said I wouldn't make it
I'm hurting they feelings
Sipping the lean out the ceiling actavis smoking on cookies

[Hook]
Everything is expensive
Yeah this life is God pricey
Revenge is so costly
Tell me what would you pay

[Verse 2: Rich The Kid]
What would you for the life
Got niggas they taken
They paying the price
Model bitch only eat rice
You can't stop my hustle put that on my life
I woke up counting bands you a fuck nigga
Walk in the trap with a spatula
Dropping the top and I laugh at her
Niggas they dab then they mad at her
From the bottom now I'm selfish chopper
On the road getting money I ain't stopping
I need a guy have a master plan
Touring the country I thank the fans
I just need a tour bus with a stove in it
Little bit of money bought more bitches
I cannot talk on the phone with ya
Chasing the paper need more riches
When you broke ain't nobody there with ya
Got niggas they getting it life sentence
Police can see me in a Porsche tinted
Flexing for bitches that Benz rented
[?] came till tomorrow
Please do not ask me to borrow
Spending your money on clothes and louboutins
But cannot pay your car note

[Hook]
Everything is expensive
Yeah this life is God pricey
Revenge is so costly
Tell me what would you pay
