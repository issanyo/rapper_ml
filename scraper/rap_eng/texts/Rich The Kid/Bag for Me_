[Chorus: PnB Rock]
Put some diamonds in my chain, now my shit bussin' (bussin')
You know I'm having cash, yeah this shit ain't nothin' (it ain't nothin')
I be posted on the block, juggin' and finessin'
She ain't suckin', she ain't fuckin'
End of discussion
Bitch, you can't get this bag for me
Bitch, you can't get this cash for me
I be posted on the block, juggin' and finessin'
She ain't suckin', she ain't fuckin'
End of discussion

[Verse: Rich The Kid]
Ooh, she

Put some diamonds in my chain, now my shit bussin' (bussin')
You know I'm having cash, yeah this shit ain't nothin' (it ain't nothin')

She ain't suckin', she ain't fuckin'
