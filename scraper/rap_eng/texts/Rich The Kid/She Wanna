Rich!

I pulled the jug on the plug too
Pull out the bentleys its brand new
I took your bitch thats my new boo
Pourin the 4 in the big blue

Wake up I count up a check
I got it all from finesse
In the trap wit a tech
Quarter mil around my neck

I jus cashed out on a new coupe
She dont wanna fuck imma give her the boot
Running around wit her Brains loose
Kick the bitch out I dont want you

Flex up flex up I had to tennis my neck up
These niggas too slow playing catch up
I got no roof when I pull up RICH!
