Okay, all my bitches foreign, all your bitches boring
My Japanese bitch said she'll be here in the morning
Bitch so bad, but I gave her a warning
Ever had a Chinese bitch sayin' "me so horny?"
In the new Mercedes, baby, with a bunch of 80s, baby
Yeah, you know I love the ladies, I can't help I drive them crazy

Have you ever made love to a foreign hoe, my nigga? (yeah)
