[Intro: Rich The Kid]
You know what I'm sayin', I know they doubted me
Counted me out, you know what I'm sayin'
Bossed up, real CEO though, read about it

[Chorus: Rich The Kid]
Suicide doors, go up (skrrt)
They ain't wanna see me blow up (what)
Huh, from the Mazi' to the Bentley trucks (Bentley trucks)
Off-White with the Gucci, I might switch it up (yeah, yeah)
Came up off a sill, sign my deal in the same week (huh)
Put my wrist on chill, AP real, that shit ain't cheap
Amiri these ain't Robin's, my jeans fit a hundred thousand
I'm the shit, like a toilet, why you flexin'? Can't afford it (huh)

[Verse 1: Rich The Kid]
Huh, I know I'm winnin' but they doubted me (doubted me)
Niggas thought that I was playin', I'm the prodigy (what)
Diamonds cooler than a cooler, shout out to my jeweler (ice, ice)
If I want that pussy sooner, put her in a Uber
I had ran up a sack, fuck a contract
Cookie pack, anthrax, catch a contact (yeah)
Rich forever I'm the CEO (CEO)
50,000 just in Barneys, I got plenty more (whoa)
Pickin' bitches out a magazine
AP or the new Philippe (ice, ice)
New Givenchy on my feet
I got three million haters, you can take a seat (Rich)

[Chorus: Rich The Kid &  Pusha-T ]
Suicide doors, go up (skrrt)
They ain't wanna see me blow up (what)
Huh, from the Mazi' to the Bentley trucks  (ooh)
Off-White with the Gucci, I might switch it up (yeah, yeah)
King Push
Came up off a sill, sign my deal in the same week (huh)
Baby, your self-esteem cannot be this low
Put my wrist on chill, AP real, that shit ain't cheap
Why is you fuckin' this man?
Amiri these ain't Robin's, my jeans fit a hundred thousand
You know he can't afford it
I'm the shit, like a toilet, why you flexin'? Can't afford it

[Verse 2: Pusha-T]
He can't afford you, baby, just abort it (kill a baby)
That 488 just got ordered
Facetimin' from the flight I just boarded (right)
I'll have my travel agent get you sorted
Nowadays you impressed by so little
I look at your top 5, niggas is so middle
The rhymes don’t even riddle
The diamonds in your Rollies don’t skittle
I see no rainbows, all you lame-os, I just changed clothes
The peacoat is Marni, you thinkin' Armani
This shit is from Jeffrey’s, that shit is from Barney’s (ooh)
You should have Zoe Costello to applaud me, or impede

[Chorus: Rich The Kid]
Suicide doors, go up (skrrt)
They ain't wanna see me blow up (what)
Huh, from the Mazi' to the Bentley trucks (Bentley trucks)
Off-White with the Gucci, I might switch it up (yeah, yeah)
Came up off a sill, sign my deal in the same week (huh)
Put my wrist on chill, AP real, that shit ain't cheap
Amiri these ain't Robin's, my jeans fit a hundred thousand
I'm the shit, like a toilet, why you flexin'? Can't afford it
