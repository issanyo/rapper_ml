[Intro]
Made 100 thou in my trap house
If ya money count short we can't work it out
(Hell you talkin' bout?)
Ridin' round the city with the choppers out
(If you talkin' then I pull up to your momma house)
I'ma air it out

[Verse 1: Rich The Kid]
Free Gucci ridin' to that Chicken Talk
Walk up in the trap, take her panties off
Twenty band cash in the Goyard
Crib has more TVs than Wal-Mart
I was just juugin' finessin'
Go ahead and teach me a lesson
Bitch nigga you a peasant
I was broke now I'm flexing
Too many rings like a champ
Ain't touchin' a brick with no stamp
My diamonds they look like a lamp
I cut off a bitch like K Camp
Bloody water in the grill
Young nigga made mil
Pop a pint, keep it trill
Actavis with the seal

[Hook: Rich The Kid]
In the kitchen, whip it up
Gotcha baby momma with her panties off
Trap talk bitch, I'm the plug
I'ma fuck her, I can't give her no love
Fuck a bitch, get the money
Rich forever, chain stuntin'
I'm in Neimans, drop 100
I'm in Neimans, drop 100
In the kitchen, whip it up
Gotcha baby momma with her panties off
Trap talk bitch, I'm the plug
I'ma fuck her, I can't give her no love
Fuck a bitch, get the money
Rich forever, chain stuntin'
I'm in Neimans, drop 100
I'm in Neimans, drop 100

[Verse 2: 21 Savage]
5k on my teeth
Fuck your bitch on the sheets
Like Slime Nudy, I don't beef
Roll the window down to eat
Cut her off cause she a leach
I'm a savage I'm a beast
All this money, I'm obese
Fuckin' freaks on the beach
I ain't the Kid but I'm rich
In the 'Rari with a stick
I'ma dog, Michael Vick
I'ma dog, Michael Vick
They fuck 'round and hand me the torch
Young niggas scrape the bowl with a fork
Young nigga been jumped off the porch
Swag a nigga like I came from New York
I spent a rack on Margielas
Smokin' gas look like Donatello
Skrt, skrt, scrape the pot with my elbow
Playin' with the kitty, I'm not talkin' hello
Zone 6 is a motherfuckin' hell hole
Drinkin' on Act', nigga fuck the yellow
Savage cuff the bitch? Fuck no, hell no
Fuck a diss song, I'm lettin' shells go

[Hook: Rich The Kid]
In the kitchen, whip it up
Gotcha baby momma with her panties off
Trap talk bitch, I'm the plug
I'ma fuck her, I can't give her no love
Fuck a bitch, get the money
Rich forever, chain stuntin'
I'm in Neimans, drop 100
I'm in Neimans, drop 100
In the kitchen, whip it up
Gotcha baby momma with her panties off
Trap talk bitch, I'm the plug
I'ma fuck her, I can't give her no love
Fuck a bitch, get the money
Rich forever, chain stuntin'
I'm in Neimans, drop 100
I'm in Neimans, drop 100
