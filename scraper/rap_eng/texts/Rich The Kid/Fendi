[RICH THE KID VERSE]
Ya ya
I fuck up the Louie and Gucci Store
Im trappin, Im whippings it outta row
I dont pull a 9 to 4
Ninja turtle now im movin’ slow
Diamonds, bitin’
Look at my Rollie its fightin’
Pull out the chopper im firin’
I stay with that, pushing alliance
Walk around, thinking’ its sweet
Pop out, leave you in the street
What’s up with these rap niggas
I don’t wanna kick it, pour up or rap witcha
I get it man, no computer
I walk around with a shooter
Ima smoke it like a hookah
Walk up on ya, ima do ya
Fuckin yo bitch at my ease
I made it they didn’t believe me
(They doubted us, u know what I’m sayin?)
I just might go to Belize
Trappin’ down like I’m Jeezy
Play wit the keys like Stevie
I put the house on me
(Big pointers, big cuban, I gotta act up. Thats the definition of new freezer)
I got the racks on me
I put your face on a tee
Knock you off for a G
I fuck up the Louie and Gucci Store
I started just trappin the tree

[YUNGPOW VERSE 1]
I keep the chips in the bank
Pockets be smelling like dank
Neck and wrist lookin like sink
Snow on my neck Ice rank
Ya you kno im up next
I made a banger with dex
Rich just taught me how to flex
I had him count up my checks
Triple s on my feet
Kiid planet on the beat
I’m in love with the money
So theres no need to cheat

[HOOK x2]
All eyes on me like some fendi
I’ll sign ur shoes like I’m Virgil
Big dawg u a gerbal
Im smoking gas u on herbal
All eyes on me like some fendi
I’ll sign ur shoes like I’m Virgil
Big dawg u a gerbal
Im smoking gas u on herbal

[YUNGPOW VERSE 2]
I spend the dough and I get it right back
Cash money hit me and I flip the pack
Keep the stash in the box they call me jack
I called up rich and he sent me the track
Moncler for the winter
Gucci flops for the summer
Ya im really with the shits
U should really call a plumber
Stop talking shit u irrelevant
I only flex for the hell of it
Stop talking shit u irrelevant
I only flex for the hell of it

[HOOK x2]
All eyes on me like some fendi
I’ll sign ur shoes like im Virgil
Big dawg u a gerbal
Im smoking gas u on herbal
All eyes on me like some fendi
I’ll sign ur shoes like im Virgil
Big dawg u a gerbal
Im smoking gas u on herbal
