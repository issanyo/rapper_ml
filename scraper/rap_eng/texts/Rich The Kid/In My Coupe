I just pulled up in my coupe
I might just fuck on your boo
Look at my hunnids they blue, ooh
I fucked your bitch after school
Dive in the bitch like a pool
Look at my chains, I'm too cool
Now she say she fallin' in love
She fell in love with the drugs
I just might make her my boo
She fell in love with the jewels
You had the juice but you lost it
My diamonds wet like a faucet
Your bitch she callin' my iPhone
Diamonds yellow like the Flintstones
They doing shit that we been on
I'm in New York like I'm Jim Jones

[Verse 1: Famous Dex, Jay Critch & Rich The Kid]
Bad bitch, I'ma bust on her titties
Good lean gotta fuck up my kidneys
More money gotta flex on these bitches
Fuck her in the Rari, switching positions
I was broke, I had to get it
I was trappin' out the kitchen
Selling dope I do the dishes
Trappin' yeah right on the stove, may God be my witness
He say he get money but I need a witness
Boy yo' money shorter than midgets
Ice on me got my frigid
Toke nice niggas know you missin'
Magazine model sucking me sloppy
Rich Forever Way they wanna copy
Play with me, they'll be finding your body
Wake up, I'ma buy a Bugatti

I just pulled up in my coupe
I might just fuck on your boo
Look at my hunnids they blue, ooh
I fucked your bitch after school
Dive in the bitch like a pool
Look at my chains not too cool
Now she say she fallin' in love
She fell in love with the drugs
I just might make her my boo
She fell in love with the jewels
You had the juice but you lost it
My diamonds wet like a faucet
Your bitch she callin' my iPhone
Diamonds yellow like the Flintstones
They doing shit that we been on
I'm in New York like I'm Jim Jones

[Verse 2: Famous Dex, Jay Critch & Rich The Kid]
I got that money on me

Rich Forever be my team
Don't trap where you stay, man they call the police
Come correct when you talking to me
Niggas sleeping but that money don't stop
I'ma stack it and go get me a watch
Bad bitch suck me up on a yacht
I'm in New York like I'm 50
Fuck her so good that she miss me
I was hustlin', counting pennies
Now my money to the ceiling
Wait, I get the Lamb and they rent it
I ain't been broke in a minute
