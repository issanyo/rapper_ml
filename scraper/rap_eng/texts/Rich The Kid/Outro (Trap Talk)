[Hook: Sample]
The taste of lead
That's how they gave it to you
But one was laced with lead

[Verse 1]
They don't wanna see you make it
They don't wanna see you shine
How to get a skateboard on the grind?
Look at my diamonds, go blind
Niggas they talkin', they broke
Y'all just be talkin' that coke
Ain’t pick up no fork, you ain’t whippin'
Never seen the Act, ain't sippin'
Alright, alright, alright
I done ran up a check overnight
Want the pussy bad, bought the bitch a flight
Look what I did to the Sprite
Lil bitty bitch want them bands
Look at the doors on the Lamb'
Like shawty, hello I'm the man
You the nigga on fire, need a fan
Many men wish death upon me
Strapped up, Dej Loaf, try me
Niggas they don't want that lead
I hit your face, not your head
You pimp out that bread
We gon' have to put you in your death bed
And I'm sippin' on the purple, not red
I've been smokin' too much, got dreads

[Hook: Sample]
The taste of lead
That's how they gave it to you
But one was laced with lead
The taste of lead
That's how they gave it to you
But one was laced with lead

[Verse 2]
They might try to take your life
But I'm walkin' with a choppa, think twice
Wake up in the mornin', gotta thank God
I'm flexin' with a Rollie, have no job
Walkin' with the cash, I do numbers
Got a Masi but I coulda bought a Hummer
And I might drop the top all summer
Why you hatin' on me tryna get commas?
They might try to take your life
Try to take your life, try to take your life
Niggas started hatin' on me, bought a Tec
I ain't worried bout nothin' but a threat
On the way to Miami on a jet
I'm a rich nigga, get the net
I'm a real savage like Offset
Pull up Forgiatos, they offset
They might try to take your life
Try to take your life, try to take your life
But I'm walkin' with a choppa, think twice
Take a chance like Vegas on the dice
All this (?) all up in the 360
All the TV hoes tryna get with me
Wake up in morning, thank God
I had holes in my shoes, now the black card

The taste of lead
That's how they gave it to you
But one was laced with lead
The taste of lead
That's how they gave it to you
But one was laced with lead
