[Hook x2: Rich The Kid]
Kitchen, whipping, cooking, flipping, broke my wrist
I done made a milli cooking with the fish
Hit the plug on the juug for the whole thang
Alicia I got keys I made them birds sing

[Verse 1: Rich The Kid]
I flip them birds on the regular
Young nigga I trap out the cellular
Fuck around with the plug
Spend a milli on the drug
Drop top with a bad bitch
I fuck her she can't get a kiss
100 thousands on my wrist
Drop top for a brick
Hold it, flip it over with that baking soda
I done made a milli off of coca cola
Flipping, whipping like a motherfucking chef nigga
Catch me ride 'round with that tech nigga
100 round drums, I got extra clips
I ain't shooting at your legs I hit your lip
2-2-3 handgun I make your body flip
I got bitches when they pull up they gon' have to strip

Kitchen, whipping, cooking, flipping, broke my wrist

Hit the plug on the juug for the whole thang
Alicia I got keys I made them birds sing

[Verse 2: MuffLucid]
A hunned that what is the cost
I'm livin' this life like a boss
My dogs they takin' no loss
Gotta hold them down, fuck the law
If they come we ready to draw
Can you fuck with that darkside squad?
All black [?]
You know we ready to do all the damage
You done fucked around and ran up on a blood
Hittin' the dopes and it's done
Flexin' my wrist [?]
My team money makin', man what the fuck you mean?
Don't make me pull it homie
Got this 380 whodi
And it pump back make you jump back
Slump that, slump that
