[Intro: Yung Dred, Rich The Kid, & Richie Wess]
This nigga Rich out here drivin' in the UK
Pussy ass nigga
Haha, hold up
Oh, nah, we on the other side, haha
Yeah, we in a different country
Nah, different shit, though
Pickin' up different money

(LegendaryKeyzz)

(TheLabCook)

Ayy, know I'm 'bout some money comin' through this motherfucker
(Throw that shit)
Dig that
(Come on)
My Brother and Me 2
(Whoa)

[Chorus: Richie Wess]
My brother and me (whoo)
My nigga still in the streets (trap)
I just called up the plug (hello)
I need a hundred of these (a hundred)
Ain't nothin' but money to me (money)
I thumb through the blue and the green (whoa)
Diamonds blue like the sea (whoo)
This who you wanna be (huh)
Y-young rich nigga, and we did it independent (whoo)
Real ice cube, frozen water on my pendant (blaow, blaow, blaow)
Real spaceship, foreign whip, this ain't regular (skrr, skrr)
Real conversations, we ain't talkin' on no cellular (hello)

[Verse 1: Richie Wess]
I met the plug in person (plug)
Me and Rich out in Berlin
Fell in love with a German (whoo)
Pussy tight like a virgin (damn)
Diamonds flashin' like sirens (bling)
Foreign roarin' like lions (skrr skrr)
Them ain't diamonds you buyin
Lyin', don't know why they keep tryin' (hahaha)
These niggas wait on the wave
These niggas ain't on the wave (nah)
They just copy and paste
Like a baker, I get to the cake (money)
That choppa'll make you erase (grra)
Run it up, I did the race (run it up)
50K right in the safe
Ten bands, that's shoe money
Blue strips, that new money (whoo)
New account just to move money (damn)
Broke niggas is too funny (hahaha)
Rich Forever, that's gang shit (gang, gang)
Gucci feet, Balmain shit (whoo)
Same drip that I came with
Talk money my language (money)
We rather be rich than famous (rich)

[Chorus: Richie Wess]
My brother and me (whoo)
My nigga still in the streets (trap)
I just called up the plug (hello)
I need a hundred of these (a hundred)
Ain't nothin' but money to me (money)
I thumb through the blue and the green (whoa)
Diamonds blue like the sea (whoo)
This who you wanna be (huh)
Y-young rich nigga, and we did it independent (whoo)
Real ice cube, frozen water on my pendant (blaow, blaow, blaow)
Real spaceship, foreign whip, this ain't regular (skrr, skrr)
Real conversations, we ain't talkin' on no cellular (hello)

[Verse 2: Rich The Kid & Yung Dred]
These niggas funny to me (huh)
I need a hundred at least (what)
You probably bought the bitch a Jeep (yah)
You might lose her for a week (skrr)
Got the Phantom out (Phantom out)
Fuck you talkin' 'bout (bitch)
Trap out momma house (trap)
Pull the fork out (whoa)
You niggas is too broke
I'm finally rich, was trappin' a elbow (trap)
She leave out the back door
In love with the money, I'm fuckin' the hundos (yeah)
Bitch be doin' too much (do too much, whoa)
I drop the Act' in my cup (Act')
I told her back that shit up (bag it up)
Fuck her, she pack that shit up (rich)

[Verse 3: Yung Dred]
Big racks got 'em mad (racks)
30 on me, that's a big bag
Thumbin' through it, that's a cool ticket (thumbin' through it)
I don't know what to do with it
My wrist water like a pool in it (whoa)
Foreign V with your boo in it
Took her back to the [?] lot (she gone)
We OT when it's too hot
My neck cold like the glaciers (blaow)
Ballin' on it like the Pacers
Draco for the haters
Draco for the, uh (grra)
Back to back with the re-up (re-up)
Started from the bottom independent
Had to make a wave, nigga, we up (whoa, hahaha)
We up

[Chorus: Richie Wess]
My brother and me (whoo)
My nigga still in the streets (trap)
I just called up the plug (hello)
I need a hundred of these (a hundred)
Ain't nothin' but money to me (money)
I thumb through the blue and the green (whoa)
Diamonds blue like the sea (whoo)
This who you wanna be (huh)
Y-young rich nigga, and we did it independent (whoo)
Real ice cube, frozen water on my pendant (blaow, blaow, blaow)
Real spaceship, foreign whip, this ain't regular (skrr, skrr)
Real conversations, we ain't talkin' on no cellular (hello)
