New freezer on me, yeah it's flooded
Racks on me like a hundred
AP bust it down
I was making real love in her mouth
I'ma fuck three hoes then I kick 'em all out
Back then I was broke, now my wrist iced out
Four rings, eight chains, like fuck it
Two models, redbones, and they fucking
Straight to the top
Old rappers, put 'em right in a box
Wrist cost a lot
Me and Tokyo race in a drop
New Patek run a cool two hundred
Thank god my whole wrist flooded
Gucci 'cause I'm hot
Fendi bought it out
