Protecting my millions from these niggas
Protecting my millions from these niggas cause they always tryna plan something
Protecting my millions from these niggas
Protecting my millions from these niggas cause they always tryna plan something
What you tryna do? What you tryna prove?
Nigga always tryna break the rules, nigga always tryna make the news
Nigga always tryna get a name, nigga always tryna have the fame
Nigga always tryna change the game, can you see the gold in my chain?

[Verse 1 – YRN Lingo]
Nigga always tryna be som’n, nigga always tryna touch som’n
Nigga always tryna bust som’n, nigga you know I don’t fuck with ya
Nigga always tryna be with ya, nigga always tryna creep with ya
Nigga always tryna see with ya
Get back nigga ‘fore I pop the trunk
And you know the hundred round gon' thump
I’m going crazy, grab my chopper, add my laser
I’m finna take a vacation, to the Bahamas and get up my racks
Throw up bitches that she bring another back
Pussy ass nigga creeping in a Cadillac
Nigga I do not care what you sayin'
Nigga I do not care what you sayin'
Are you putting money in my hands?
Stacks on top of stacks with rubber bands?
My hands are so hot need to cool down
Carry the stick while I’m in town
Shut the fuck up nigga, lay down
Chopper make you dance, James Brown

[Verse 2 – Skippa Da Flippa]
Can you see the gold in my chain
Had cash money when I was plain Jane
Twin turbos and Forgi’d the fucking range
Got to pour four just to maintain
You want to be noticed, I want to be rich
I still came up quick, you a thick money Mitch
Flippa the ho doctor, you think I’m Hitch
She'll transport the dope if you give her some dick
Me and Lingo we just throwing C notes
So many bags, I think I’m eagles
Count so much money till my fingers tingle
OG Christmas tree like Mr. Jingles
Navigator same color Akon
Golden gun, no James Bond
Call of Duty scope but you won’t respawn
Triple wrap a hundred, stash it in the pond

[Verse 3 – Rich The Kid]
Pussy nigga want to try something
Chopper extendo the hand gun
Bitch you fussy cause a nigga made it
Wearing two Rolexs, I got plenty paper
Protecting my millions, hand me the blue Benjamins in the ceiling
They trust these bitches, I just overnight em
Rolex bezel, it got plenty diamonds
Little nigga, I was really juuging
Kitchen cooking, I'mma whip it, flip it
Lingo got the roof missing
Fuck your bitch, bust up on her titties
See the backpack scar like Guwop
Me against the world like 2Pac
In the trap, rerock with the two Glocks
I’m a real trap nigga, that’s a straight drop
