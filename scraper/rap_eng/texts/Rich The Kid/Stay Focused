[Hook: Rich The Kid]
I got them blue hundreds keep 'em on me
Y'all drinking Qualitest I'm sippin' codeine
Yo nigga lame I know he broke in that ford focus
Told myself stay focused now that drop top loaded
I got them blue hundreds keep 'em on me
Y'all drinking Qualitest I'm sippin' codeine
Yo nigga lame I know he broke in that ford focus
Told myself stay focused now that drop top loaded

[Verse 1: Rich The Kid]
Told myself stay focused rollie bands on loaded
They put me in a ford I bought myself a Lotus
Hit my knees thank God
Trap the block word hard
Sippin I’m swerving on two bars
real nigga no fraud
They call me flippa I'm havin'
Touchdown on the plug like John Madden
You cuffin', I'm fuckin a pornstar
She sucking me up in a sportscar
Fuck it I'm doing the dash
I'm smokin' the cookie no gas
Jung the plug with the mask
Focused on nothing but the cash
Big rocks in the bezel
Young nigga with the cheddar
Bathing Ape on the sweater
Stay focused live better
Now I'm on another level
Red Bottoms on the pedal
I want the stone like a Tea Kettle
Diamonds dancing

[Hook: Rich The Kid]
I got them blue hundreds keep em on me
Y’all drinking Qualitest I'm sippin' codeine
Yo nigga lame I know he broke in that ford focus
told myself stay focused now that drop top loaded
I got them blue hundreds keep 'em on me
Y'all drinking Qualitest I'm sippin' codeine
Yo nigga lame I know he broke in that ford focus
Told myself stay focused now that drop top loaded

[Verse 2: Skippa Da Flippa]
I been stacking four million, I love the cash
top floor condo know I'm living lavish
If you are no a trapper are no a rapper what is your status
Flip the PT's like gymnastics
Put my niggas on when I got the package
I stay with them hundreds to me it is nothing
To you iIknow it is something
Who got the [?]
She make a nigga come quick soon as she jump on it
Grab me a three and I pour in a liter
You follow I know I'm the leader
I be dabbin' and accounts with cash
I know she love my demeanor
You know I had to cap the trap
I heard ya hustle how ya rap
talk in code like its tap
Ain't got no time to see my nigga take a nap
Juug a twenty off of phones
Lord forgive me I know I was wrong
350 for the zone
the devil put a nigga on

[Hook: Rich The Kid]
I got them blue hundreds keep 'em on me
Y'all drinking Qualitest, I'm sippin' codeine
Yo nigga lame I know he broke in that ford focus
told myself stay focused now that drop top loaded
I got them blue hundreds keep 'em on me
Y'all drinking Qualitest I'm sippin' codeine
Yo nigga lame I know he broke in that ford focus
told myself stay focused now that drop top loaded
