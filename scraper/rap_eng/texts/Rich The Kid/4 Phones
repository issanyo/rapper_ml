[Chorus : Rich the Kid]
And now I've got cash I ain’t got to brag no more
I play with the money I just might go and [?]
I run through the check, I'm fuckin the baggest clothes (baggest clothes)
[?]
I drop a whole [?] now my neck frozen (ice)
Rich Forever [?]
They gon' still trappin I’ve got 4 phones

[Verse : Rich the Kid]
Niggas is cap for real
80 and a half for meal
A big ass thick so real
I don't trap I pay the bills
Money longer need to pick up trunk
Lotta hundreds we can pick'em up
Got a [?]
In the tesla but I had to switch
Niggas [?] I really count a flip

They was lying but I'm really rich
She be lying you can't trust the bitch
Want the money yeah the check that's it
Rubber bands I ain't [?] my wrist
Broke niggas they ain't talk ’bout shit
I was broke, had to hit that lick

[Chorus : Rich the Kid]
And now I’ve got cash I ain't got to brag no more
I play with the money I just might go and [?]
I run through the check, I’m fuckin the baggest clothes (baggest clothes)
[?]
I drop a whole [?] now my neck frozen (ice)
Rich Forever [?]
They gon' still trappin I've got 4 phones

[Verse : Rich the Kid]

[Chorus : Rich the Kid]
And now I've got cash I ain’t got to brag no more
I play with the money I just might go and [?]
I run through the check, I'm fuckin the baggest clothes (baggest clothes)

I drop a whole [?] now my neck frozen (ice)
Rich Forever [?]
They gon' still trappin I've got 4 phones
