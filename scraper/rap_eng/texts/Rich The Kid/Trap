[Verse 1: Rich The Kid]
My diamonds is dancing
I pull up in Phantoms
I trap out a mansion
My bitches they come cross the border
They naked no bra or no panties
I fly with a fish & i fly with a fish
And I whip and I'm breaking my wrist
My ice from the glacier
I'm sipping the Lakers
I'm rich like the mayor
Fuck a nigga's feelings, bitch I'm rich, I don't give a damn
I just fucked a nigga baby momma off of Instagram
Trapping and trapping it turned into rapping
I don't even know how it happened
The money is coming in an orderly fashion
Young nigga I'm capping and trapping
Flipping the work wit' no spatula
Pull up in 'Rarri, I'm crawling tarantula
My nigga got choppers, berettas and uzis
I promise they'll damage ya
Migo gang, pull up flexin' 30 chains
Lamb no brains, got it off of cocaine

Trap, trap, trap, trap
Hit it wit the remix, re-rock
No straight drop, my whole hood trap

[Verse 2: Offset]
How does it feel to be broke?
White diamonds like coke
Wrapping the brick up like mummies
100 bricks coming on monday
Just a young ass nigga, thats 15
Chapo wit' the red beam
No Rockets I got Yao Mings
Yadda Mean?
I'm speaking bilingual
I'm talking in spanish
That Mota', coca'
Baking soda
Feeling like Pablo Escobar
Trapping in Louis V Loafers
So much got damn cash
I feel like a Bank of America broker
Got shooters wit me nigga
I thought I told ya
The game is not checkers it's chess
No spades it's poker
I travel the world, you local
Mo bags then Krogers
Young nigga, with a hundred rounds
Bitch it's over

Young nigga finna blow ya brains out
Tornado arms
Play wit the water like thunderstorm

What ya gone do? Better run

Trap with extension across the map
