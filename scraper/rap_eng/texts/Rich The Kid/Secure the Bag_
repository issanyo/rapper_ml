[Verse 1: Chris Brown]
Baby, baby, you know I'ma spend all of this money on you
You don't even really have to ask
You put it on me crazy and you got a nigga fienin' for you
She told me to smack her on her ass

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown]
She know that I secure the bag, she want the bag
Throwin' all this cash, I got the bag
I secure the bag, I got that bag
Throwin' this cash up, baby I need it

[Chorus: Chris Brown & Rich The Kid]
I'm gonna need you
I'm gonna need you, I got that bag (bag)
I'm gonna need you, I'm gonna need you

I'm gonna need you, I got that bag (oh)
Throwin' this cash up. baby, I need it (Rich)

[Verse 2: Rich The Kid]
Bag secured, my nigga they get to the cash for sure (bag, for sure)
I smash of course, she wanted the bag that you can't afford (smash, huh)
Threw too many Hunnids, they double up (hunnids, huh)
She wanna fuck with me

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown]
She know that I secure that bag, she want the bag
Throwin' all this cash, I got that bag
I secure the bag, I got that bag
Throwin' this cash up, baby I need it

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
