[Intro]
Yeah, yeah, yeah
It's a lotta, lotta hatin' goin' on
Lot of foolery
Lot of fugazin'
Lot of, lot of fakes

[Chorus]
Get off your ass and hustle (huh?)
Now that I flex with muscle (flex)
Niggas they runnin' for cover (flex)
I'm fuckin' your bitch undercovers (yuh)
I'm the definition of a hustler
I was juggin' so hard, got busted (got busted)
Them lil' model bitches ain't nothin' (nothin')
I would hustle so hard, my wrist straight busted
Get off your ass and hustle (huh?)
Now that I flex with muscle (flex)
Niggas they runnin' for cover (flex)
I'm fuckin' your bitch undercovers (yuh)
I'm the definition of a hustler
I was juggin' so hard, got busted (got busted)
Them lil' model bitches ain't nothin' (nothin')
I would hustle so hard, my wrist straight busted

[Verse]
Yo' bih' want some head on the couch (on the couch)
Niggas Instagram flexin' for the clout (for the what?)
I was broke, got bands and accounts (I was broke)
First thing, taught my son how to count (how to count)
These rappers, they real deal hoes (they hoes)
I know that you actin', you might get exposed (yuh)
My pockets, they finna explode (my pockets)
Ride with the lean, pourin' more than a 4 (yuh)
I finally finished probation (probation)
The feds, they watchin', I stick with my Haitians
My only friend is the Benjamins
I'm finally rich but got too many enemies
I need my percentage, you bitin' (you bitin')
In love with the flex, and keep talkin' 'bout diamonds (flex)
You fuck niggas doubtin' me (doubtin' me)
I'm hurtin' they feelings, I pull out the Lamborghini (skrrt)
Ooh, my niggas shootin' a movie (grra)
No Biggie but I used to trap in the Coogi
Yuh, yuh, yuh, yuh, dat way (dat way)
Yeah, bitch, I pull up that Wraith (flex)
She wanna fuck with the campaign (campaign)
150 bottles, but I don't drink champagne
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, dat way (dat way)
Money way, bitch, that's the only way (flex)

[Chorus]
Get off your ass and hustle (huh?)
Now that I flex with muscle (flex)
Niggas they runnin' for cover (flex)
I'm fuckin' your bitch undercovers (yuh)
I'm the definition of a hustler
I was juggin' so hard, got busted (got busted)
Them lil' model bitches ain't nothin' (nothin')
I would hustle so hard, my wrist straight busted
Get off your ass and hustle (huh)
Now that I flex with muscle (flex)
Niggas they runnin' for cover (flex)
I'm fuckin' your bitch undercovers (yuh)
I'm the definition of a hustler
I was juggin' so hard, got busted (got busted)
Them lil' model bitches ain't nothin' (nothin')
I would hustle so hard, my wrist straight busted
