(*talking*)
It's one hundred - 3x
S.U.C., this how we do it mayn
The Take Over

[Hook - 2x]
It's one hundred, me and my niggas we gon keep it one hundred
Riding around in big Benz, getting blunted
Parking lot pimping, we sitting low up on them 20's
It's all one hundred, nigga

[Mike D]
I've been gone for a minute, look how the rules done changed
Since a few of these cake niggas, took position in the game
I guess it's true, all the real niggas dead or on lock
And the few that's still standing, done found another route
I don't play because out here, situation critical
Low down and pitiful, the streets'll get rid of ya
That OG talk, I'm like EF Hutch
Nigga pause and pay attention, like I'm strutting on buttons
Ain't no honor among thieves, no mo'
These lil' niggas'll get full of that dro, and run through your do'
Then have the nerve, like they done a lil' some'ing
And catch 'em in the county, they be sideways bumping
But believe me lil' daddy, your click ain't gon save ya
Jack me I'll jack back, send ya to your maker

[Lil 3rd]
Hundred percent, S.U.C. believe that
Choppers and calicoes, respond as feedback
You can tuck your tail back, now where your Clover G's at
Fifty in your head, fifty mo' where your knees at
Parking lot pimping, twenty spreading where your knees at
And the Clover, where the ghosts know in army fatigue hats
Split a nigga head, like I just skeed that
Screwed Up Click, cap that's where the best eat at
Southsi' for li', bitch nigga believe that
Respect, or it's drama involved when you see that
Boys shaken up, like a bad weed sack
Before I squab full of terror, make a nigga lean back

[Hook - 2x]

Fa sho I'm a hundred, I keep it gutter grimey gangsta
And money after cash, I blast on all prankstas
Give it to 'em raw, come real is all I know
Gon get it and come back with it, true blue head to toe
Seen it all heard it twice, five deuce like dice
In the do' slanging banging, putting it all in your life
1 double O fa sho, pack it up that's how it's coming
Candy dripping Davin's spinning, wood gripping trunk bumping
Rep the click until I fall, united and standing tall
Throw it up and rep it watch this, one hundred the Lord call
I'm a hundred with words, and I'm a hundred with birds
I'm a hundred with Miggity Mike D, and 3rd
Game won S.U.C., Greenstone real nigga
Certified with the game, Woodfair go getter

[Trae]
What the fuck, they thinking cuz
This problem here ain't no solving, 'til they be stinking cuz
Fresh off the chain a motherfucker better check theyself, shit they better go check they health
Slugs deep inside of they pack, fucked off I'ma bet they felt
Fuck a hundred, I'm a hundred and ninety-nine to the T
Asshole by Nature bitch, cause it define who I be
I heard some niggas in the game, ain't never heard of my set
May unload the back and make the bitch clap, while introducing my set
A.B.N., S-L-A-B and S.U.C. what I'm toting
And plus you need to pay attention, from this chrome that I'm toting
With thirty shots for thirty jocks, a dot and a hot Glock
In something that's sitting dropped, and tipping on plenty blocks

[Hook - 2x]
