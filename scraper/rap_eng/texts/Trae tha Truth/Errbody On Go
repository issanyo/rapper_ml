[Hook: JuneOnnaBeat]
Body baggers, body, toe tag
Jump out with a K that worked for (?)
In any car you in, we gon' tag that
Put a whole hunnid side nigga, you can have that
I just talked to (?) to a full liter
You better keep your heat, keep your toolie
Stop tellin' all these bitches you gon' do me
Cause when you see me, you ain't ever try to shoot me

[Verse 1: Mozzy]
Everybody on go nigga, everybody on go
We get to flocking at your nose
Everybody on go nigga, everybody on go
Don't try to play close
10k for a show
Everybody gon' go, so you know everybody on go
Grab these niggas to the throat nigga
Bust it down, rolling dope nigga
I can't even eat til I smoke nigga
Everybody on go nigga, everybody gon' go
We get to flocking at your nose
Everybody on go nigga, everybody gon' go
Oh, try to play me to close
Checked a hunnid on a hoe nigga
I checked a hunnid on a hoe
How the fuck I'm never going broke
She what a real nigga want nigga
You know I was a lil bro
I just walked in and got throat
So you know...

[Verse 2: Trae tha Truth]
Fuck what them niggas talkin' they ain't got nothing on me
I pull up out the festivity, slidin' by my lonely
I got my weight up cause they ain't respect when I was boney
Right off the boulder Miami I pick the path of Tony
King of the streets, I was Michael Jordan with fundamentals
Jumped out the rental, no talkin', I'm aimin' for your dentals
These niggas pussy, I'm savagin' ain't nothing sentimental
I'm out my mental, I'm pressed, ain't nothing accidental
I'm from the West where niggas makin' killin' they hobby
Boy, you don't mean it if you ain't standin' over his body
They burning niggas like something going wrong with a thottie
Hoe niggas better check in, I ain't talkin' no lobby
Tryna fuck up a sack, me and money was trippin'
I hit the block and tell 'em brick no walkin' no skippin
I'm the big homie in the city, don't need your permission
I wrote the book hoeing niggas this the special edition

Everybody on go, everybody on go
Everybody on go, everybody on go
Everybody on go, everybody on go
Everybody on go, everybody on go
Everybody on go, everybody on go
Everybody on go, everybody on go
