[Hook]
Cradle 2 tha grave, told you one time gotsta, gotsta get paid
Another 48, nigga
Ride, ride every day
Cradle 2 tha grave, told you one time gotsta, gotsta get paid
You ain't shit if you ain't screwed up
Ride, ride every day

[Verse 1]
I'mma come down, sittin' so heavy
Glass on the 4-6, shoes on the Chevy
Slidin' through the streets, [?] 'til it's over
Haters trynna witness, I ain't speakin' no Jehovah
'Nother hater trip, I got this top on me
And any time I come around I got they boppers on me
And I be flippin' like a motherfucka, get money
Tell 'em kiss me through the night, I still can make it Sunday
I got these diamonds in my mouth, what you wanna do?
Steal, bang, screw, come through
Some brand new, sicker than the flu
In the trap trynna throw his fears, trynna see this bread
On the low, trynna stay ahead, gangsta 'til I'm dead, nigga

[Hook]
Cradle 2 tha grave, told you one time gotsta, gotsta get paid
Ride, ride every day
Cradle 2 tha grave, told you one time gotsta, gotsta get paid
Ride, ride every day

[Verse 2]
Ridin' through the hood, still doin' mine
Mama say I'm fine, hustle 'til I shine
Bumper on recline, never make a sign
Left the trunk open and the top fallin' down
Ridin' every day, ho I don't play
Alphabet killa, hit 'em with the K
Fuck up out my way, nigga, I'm the truth
Word to mafio, bitch, deuce out the roof
Chickens in the coop, talkin' white bricks
Pull up with them sticks, talkin' shit to K [?]
Ridin' slow motion, incised leather
E'rry block flooded give a fuck about the weather
Water, nigga

[Hook]
Cradle 2 tha grave, told you one time gotsta, gotsta get paid
Ride, ride every day
Cradle 2 tha grave, told you one time gotsta, gotsta get paid
Ride, ride every day
