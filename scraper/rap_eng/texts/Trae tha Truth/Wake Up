[Hook: French Montana]
Wake up, wake up
Nigga, it's the first of the month
Pay up, pay up
Buying all the drugs that you want
Wake up, wake up
Nigga, it's the first of the month
Pay up, pay up
Buying everything that I want

Moving ceiling but how long
Before these niggas try to G on their own
Now I'm moving ceiling but how long
Before these niggas stop trying to G on their own

[Verse 1: Trae Tha Truth]
So we in debt with the devil's daughter
Re-up this first quarter
Prices they going lower
This shipment fresh out the border
Yeah bitch I got it cheaper
Pumping just like a speaker
Hood say these niggas jacking
I lay 'em down like a sleeper
Kill this shit like the reaper
Trap finals, I'm a sweeper
Plus that shit you got weaker
I'm hands-on trying to freak her
Buried off in this bottle
What you need bitch, I got 'em
Here that shit bitch, I got 'em
Don't worry about it bitch, I got 'em
Carpooling with this work
I'm on this clock bitch, I work
Where them grimy niggas play in dirt
With something tucked in this shirt
The first and fifteenth I'm collecting these checks
Fuck if you a smoker or a hustler, just give me my checks
Yeah, wake up, wake up, nigga it's the first of the month
Just call me Pusha T, I get you anything that you want

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
I just can't leave this white bitch
My Cubans cut my mic switch
Loaded all up in my garage
YG say it might fit
Yeah, I got Whitney hostage
I got Bobby working
I got Screw jacked up
I only talk in person
Count this money like the bank
I'm trapping, what the fuck you think?
Inhale this loud up its dank
This gas, I ain't talking tanks
Top ten, I ain't talking ranks
650, I could get your drank
Look nigga, not no alcohol
That Texas shit that make you faint
Then I hit the NY with French
Did 305 with Ross
Then I hit the hood and took off
Shit, other than that, I get lost
I'm an H-Town bill collector
Anytime you lay this over
Look bitch, I practice work religion blueprintthem like Hova
Call me trapper man, I take it where the fuck others don't
