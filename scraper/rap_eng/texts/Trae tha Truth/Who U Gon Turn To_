[Verse 1: Trae Tha Truth]
Damn my nigga, it was good just a week ago
Who would have thought that she went to chris
And I would see her go
I kept the cold but nowadays no one believe in those
I had to back this how I seen it when you hit the door
They say when it rains it pours
Bitch I’m under water
So every midnight I return to my heavenly father
I realized nobody knows you when you hit the bottom
They give you 30 but soon as she come around I got em
I used to feel like fuck the world, nowadays it’s still the same
I never cried myself to sleep, I stayed and took the pain
Real shit, fuck niggas with they fakin ass
And fuck bitches in the dark, they so a shakin ass
It’s hoe it now but I know one day all this shit will pass
I feel they only lookin down cause now I’m on my ass
They used to try [?] and took me out, it’s on the gas
I would have heard them if my stupid ass wasn’t skippin class

[Hook]
When thangs get hard man, who u gone turn to?
Thangs get hard man, who u gone turn to?
Better hope them niggas that you with never burn you
Better hope them bitches that you with never burn you

[Verse 2: Mistah]
When my mama died feeled like my world turnt up and down
Daddy died, father side, I don’t even talk to them
God up in heaven, wish man I could take a walk with him
It’s often them that follow him, who offer then support for men
Religion cause confusion to these children of this orphanage
In the ghetto we are orphans, in the ghetto’s hell, of course it is
Of course it is, smile, you used to keep high the tears of pain
Grinding for so damn long with nothin to show of years of game
My peers remain, stuck behind some prison chains
Recipients of life, just for living strange
Life sentences, damn they was giving maine
Stuck in the cell, was hard to hide this hidden pain
Forbid in vain, forget in fame
Lil nigga got shot, cause he hit the block
All with a bigger chain
Hell is hot, on my block it will burn to you
Cause when it’s hard man, who u gone turn to

[Hook]
When thangs get hard man, who u gone turn to?
Thangs get hard man, who u gone turn to?
Better hope them niggas that you with never burn you
Better hope them bitches that you with never burn you

[Outro]
You know they way what go around come around
So you know my time is coming yo, yeah
