(*"What can I do" is repeated as a snippet to the beat throughout the song*)

[talking]
Asshole By Nature
I see you motherfuckers just determined
To make a nigga get on y'all ass
Roach ass motherfuckers
I don't know what to do with you beat up ass broke motherfuckers
See us in the streets......

[Verse 1 - Boss]
What can I do to get these hoe ass niggas out my mix
I'm straight from the block tryna get a brick
I ended up puttin shit down with the click
Now a bunch of niggas out ridin my dick
I'm a slide me a bitch, sit him in the 6
Put zip lock then I'm a hide me a bitch
No more pride for the bitch
Niggas get mad cause I bang to the left, and plus I ride when I switch
Stickin to the G guide line, peep them from the side line
Boss gotta big gat bitch I'm a hide mine
Got it ready to pop and put you on the high line
From my hot nine thinkin I would never pull out and pop mine
Bitch it's the maab, ridin our dick must be your big job
I might serve every nigga standin in your squad
Got G's from over seas, and places apart
You don't wanna fuck around
Put him in the middle of a 30-30 scope and I'm buckin him down
4 slugs hit e'm before he touchin' the ground
I'm in love with my rounds, I be lovin the sound
While I'm huggin four pounds, hoe made niggas better move when I'm 'round
Before my face show a frown

Hittin niggas up with that HGC and that 2-2-3 and I'm ditchin the town

[Verse 2 - Trae]
Guess who the fuck-top back in the do'
Seperatin from the plex with a beam and a scope
Hop fly I'm a hit a nigga dead in his throat
With a mac fully attack no force to let go
Might touch on a nigga like Shaq
Hit him in chest now he body rockin like Pat
When he size up I'm a put his ass on his back
Have his bitch ass runnin to the trunk for the gat-where the haters at
Better yet nigga why bother, I'm a pain in the ass like Antonio Tarver
ABN we opperate like the carter, and been G'd up since a nigga was starters
North to the South, South back to the North
East to the West let it go I set it off
We the team of the H plus we run with the south
Trae, Jayton, Z Ro the Crooked, and Lil'Boss
Hop in the L crank up ready to floss
Swoop through the block my frame ready-to-toss
Mouth piece gotta nigga bout to goin off
Cause my grill worth about 4 ki's in the south
Now what can I do about niggas like these
AK's to the chest will make them burn like trees
Forty-rounds out the clip will make them scat like fleas
Roach ass nothin type of niggas gotta bleed
