[Verse 1]
Yeah
They tell me to be patient, I tell 'em them days is over with
You ain't feeling how I was feeling
Then why the hell you talking up in my face?
You better know the kid
Everyone judging me like a killer
I was [?] somehow, read the [?] of my mission
I did it out of love and love is what they missin'
I told 'em play it solid, but now I see they ain't listen
It's funny how them niggas the same niggas who dissin'
They better play it safe, I played it gangsta when it was tension
Holding on this toolie like somebody need them a fixin'
I don't trust shit, everywhere I look niggas switchin'
The fuck I kept it real when that part of it they was ditchin'
Shout out to my old bitch, I wish you the worst
Any feeling I thought I had I put that shit in a hearse
I'mma do this for every day that you was laughing at verse
Who laughing now? Underestimated, my worth, I'm good
Keeping it G with it, I get to you like I'm a feeling
Balling like Jordan and Pippen way back in '97
Reminiscing about all my niggas who made it to heaven
And all the ones I know didn't who needed the reverend
It's still love, God bless their soul
Every time I think about it that shit there cold
[?] with the pressure, still I will not fold
Nigga, I've been a king, now my crown covered in gold, for real

[Chorus]
Yeah, I know they hoping it was over for me
Yeah, check it, I know they hoping it was over for me

[Verse 2]
The industry of my city labeled me as an outcast
No Big or 3K, just me in this black mask
Nothing easy, I'm fainting like how long will this shit last?
Knowing they all together heaven toast with a shot glass
Fuck 'em though, I hope them niggas choke on a shoe [?]
Headed to the top, I know they hoping this coupe crash
I know they only live to count me out like loose cash
I'm rolling with my feelings tucked away like a [?]
Plus my attitude nothing here worth talking about
Nothing personal, just don't give a fuck what you talking about
Talking so tunnel vision, every day I was walking out
I'm sick of the pain, where the fuck he at? Let me call him out
I ain't looking for help 'cause ain't nobody gon' do shit
But watch a nigga sink it to ya they never knew shit
They play it like a snake infiltrating your cruise ship
Jealousy a disease and it spread like the flu, shit
I ain't dying, niggas' code ain't nothing like mine
Nowadays niggas get with you so they can talk down
Telling me it's love, but they hoping I get choked down
Everybody's wave's fucked up, I'm glad I caught mine
Got me feeling this my time, man, I'mma take it
Worth somewhere in the coma, I gotta wake it
Guess this shit part of my life, I can't escape it
I been aim high, it's time to elevate it, nigga

[Chorus]
Yeah, I know they hoping it was over for me
Yeah, I know they hoping it was over for me
