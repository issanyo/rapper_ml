Yeah, you ain't playing fair, fuck your ground rules

Whole lotta hand, help [?] the rounds too

[Verse 1: Trae tha Truth]
Yeah, smoothie got me feeling like Pac, let me revive 'em
Niggas better know if I'm slidin', they better hide 'em
In your business, all on my dick, it ain't no ride
Any given, I could fuck up the streets or either guide 'em
[?] gas, no brakes right out the gate
Fuck the weight, I'm tryna make shit shake until it break
Mindstate told me flush this white, I call it Kate
Hey, who? Boss, this shit crackin' he takin' plates
[?] niggas in the lake, no yachts, we 48 'em
Two sticks, I'm starving, it's savage the way he ate 'em
Hit neck, tell him go [?] without the hair
I'm a asshole, fuck what you talkin', nothing fair nigga

[Verse 2: Mozzy]
No more than a 4, niggas know where I go
If you ain't a 4 fuck it, buck down a deuce
I need more woods, on my way to the store
They brought a Randall knife and they're playing this cool
Yeah, I had to get it off the stove for my school clothes
Lil' brat Freddie B sprintin' on them group-ons
[?] it was two toned
First she heard of Kevin Gates, baby he had two phones
All kinda nookie bitches in my new phone
All kinda nookie bitches in my new phone
Usalama, can't afford to move wrong
He ain't moving mean, for the [?] you should move along

[Hook: Mozzy]

[Verse 3: Snoop Dogg]
When I come through I'm bangin' like a crip dawg
Sippin' on some Cisco, hand on my pistol
Chicken grease with the Crisco
Kaepernick, slap a bitch, we in San Francisco
This hoe, that hoe, nigga you can add 'em up
Been with the shit, two strikes nigga, bat up
Jumpin' out the GM with it
I learned how to swim with it
Thirteen, learned to mix a lil' gin with it
Been with it and you can check my pedigree
Let it be, there's a picture of me next to the letter C
I'm confident, the crip keeper
I'm at your door, doing chores with the street sweeper nigga

[Hook: Mozzy]
You ain't playing fair, fuck your ground rules

Whole lotta hand, help [?] rounds too
Whole lotta hand, help [?] rounds too

Whole lotta hand, help [?] rounds too
Whole lotta hand, help [?] rounds too
