[Intro]
Say You remember that shit
Talmbout them days nigga
We pull up nigga sta-flo starched down

[Chorus]
(I pray they take me back)
Pants standing up by themselves
(I pray they take me back)
Big ass nugget mothafuckin' earrings fake ass gold chains nigga fake
(I pray they take me back)
Mothafuckin golds in our mouths
(I pray they take me back)
We the coolest niggas on earth mane starter jackets, gummies, flat tops
(I pray they take me back)
Nigga remember all that shit mane couldn't tell me shit in my mothafuckin life
(I pray they take me back)
Late nights sweet talkin' on the mothafuckin phone
Thinkin we muhfuckin R&B stars an' shit
An' ya ass had to beat that curfew
Or ya ass was gettin an ass woopin nigga
(Yeah)

[Verse 1]
Thinkin' bout them early days like "What the fuck I did with life?"
Funny how fast time'll past and make you pray to live it twice
Overalls and British knights
Spray painted the huffy bike
Just to ride the block like I'm the shit pull up on something nice
She was wearing daisy dukes finger weighs and hoopsins
Baskets from the grocery store just to shoot some hoops in
Corner store passing up them old niggas under the trees
Yelling out look out but I keep going its 90Â°
Hoping ain't no dogs loose
Might just have to switch routes
Plus I want my kool cup
She better not be sold out
Gun be lookin' wop sided, leanin' like its fallin over
Grease fallin on my shoulder
Still I feel cool like the polar

[Chorus]
(I pray they take me back)
I was playa though
(I pray they take me back)
Days like that made me who the fuck I am man
(I pray they take me back)
I remember mothafuckin me an' boss stepping out
(I pray they take me back)
Jay'ton ain't old enough to come out so he gotta stay at the crib
(I pray they take me back)
Madder than a mothafucka
(I pray they take me back)
Nigga used to pull up at the skating ring nigga
(I pray they take me back)
Nigga any mothafuckin broad we want nigga we gon' shoot on sight
(I pray they take me back)
Lord knows prolly ain't get them hoes anyway but fuck it
(Check it)

[Verse 2]
Doing things we had no business
Had me feeling like a menace
Hopping over gates and nigga knocking running like a scrimmage
Somewhere in and out my granny house she yelling close the door
Soon as she flip out and get that switch, oh shit its time to go
What youknow
Older brother on his way to juvenile
Jackin' cars begging them to ride but I was just a child
All I knew was a lot of laws, movies had us running wild
Gold tooth, open face, I wanted it just to smile
Couldn't get it hit beauty supply and got the fake instead
Pager on my waist and stolen candy tryna make some bread
Stole my partna daddy gun bet no one go'n take my shoes
All about respect I knew to make a move or stay confused

[Chorus]
(I pray they take me back)
I'm talmbout them stadium old days nigga
(I pray they take me back)
Round that time nigga nigga seen Menace to Society, Boyz 'n the Hood nigga
(I pray they take me back)
Err Thang dickie down nigga
(I pray they take me back)
You'd have thought we were biggest mothafuckin' gangstas in the city
(I pray they take me back)
I love that shit though mane
(I pray they take me back)
Them the mothafuckin' days man
(I pray they take me back)

[Outro]
I can't tell about all this new shit going on right now
But I remember what we had going back then
Remember them mothafuckin' Rolex banners
Young nigga diggin', you knew him, crazy lil' mothafucker though
Motherfuckin' brother nigga, I ain't forgettin' this shit
Mf brother i ain't forgot this shit
