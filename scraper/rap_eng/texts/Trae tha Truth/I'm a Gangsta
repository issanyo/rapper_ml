(Chorus-Trae)
I'm a gangsta, they don't make these on the block
Gan-gangsta, they don't make these on the block
I'm a gangsta, they don't make these on the block
Gan-gangsta, they don't make these on the block
I'm a gangsta, they don't make these on the block
Gan-gangsta, they don't make these on the block
I'm a gangsta, they don't make these on the block
Gan-gangsta, they don't make these on the block

[Verse 1-Trae]
I'm a gangsta, they don't make these on the block
Twenty inch 4's, they don't make these on the drop
If they wanna jack I ain't finna tell a nigga stop
I bet a hundred stacks he can't take this out the Glock
I'm a damn fool puttin broke niggas outta stock
Take a picture bitch send it to my niggas on lock
I'm a asshole, ghetto hoes love the way I rock
A sick mouth piece-I talk a bitch right up out the cot
I'm 'Tha Truth'if you say a nigga name
And I'll be there to cross ya ass if you say a nigga lame
I use to have a Hoop, but I rearranged the frame
So when they see me tippin slow-they get the fuck up out the lane
All Star in the game, money longer then a train
I finally got fly and I don't think I'm finna change
Thirty stacks out the safe so they see a nigga change
Fifty mo stacks now they know a nigga name
Nah the game ain't the same my attitude thru the roof
I'm bout to take my right hand and run it thru a nigga tooth
I hear boys gettin fly, swagger jackin in the booth
Tell them dickridin niggas that I'm the mothafuckin truth, Real Talk!

(Chorus-Trae)
I'm a gangsta, they don't make these on the block
Gan-gangsta, they don't make these on the block
I'm a gangsta, they don't make these on the block
Gan-gangsta, they don't make these on the block
I'm a gangsta, they don't make these on the block
Gan-gangsta, they don't make these on the block
I'm a gangsta, they don't make these on the block
Gan-gangsta, they don't make these on the block

[Verse 2-Trae]
Ay a nigga wanna find me-I'm the streets of the south
With a bunch of ignorant niggas that'll take it to ya house
In a click of black whips everytime a nigga floss
I tell a bitch to give me head, and tell a bitch to get lost
It ain't nothin to a boss-I'm a league of my own
Better greet me with the code when you hit me on the phone
Tell them hoes I'm on the roam on 26 inches of chrome
I'm at a half of mill and that's off of rappin alone
If you think I'm goin broke my nigga that's where you wrong
If the rappin stops I load up a couple bricks then I'm gone
I use to watch my brother turn powder right into stones
But I done switched the game and put the crack in a form of a song
Now I got the hood set, doors flyin like a jet
Ostrich in the whip got haters on deck
If they thinkin that was somethin tell e'm see me in a sec
Everytime I pull up on e'm I'ma leave they face wrecked(haha)
I'll shut a bitch down, have e'm shook when I'm around
Get e'm if they pride high try to run it to the ground
Ain't shit to get the click and make niggas get out of town
If you ever see this gangsta, then hit e'm up with a sign

(Chorus-Trae)
I'm a gangsta, they don't make these on the block
Gan-gangsta, they don't make these on the block
I'm a gangsta, they don't make these on the block
Gan-gangsta, they don't make these on the block
I'm a gangsta, they don't make these on the block
Gan-gangsta, they don't make these on the block
I'm a gangsta, they don't make these on the block
Gan-gangsta, they don't make these on the block

[Verse 3-Trae]
I'm a gangsta nigga you can tell when I walk
Right off the rip I check a bitch, and you can tell when I talk
I lost count ain't no tellin how many guns I done bought
And when it come to beef I won everytime that I fought
And if I ever end up caught, I get right back to the streets
And if I need to check a bitch I get right back to the beats
And if I need to touch a bitch I'm finna put e'm to sleep
And have his body out of function for a number of weeks
Asshole nigga never will I fold
And I represent the hood everywhere a nigga roll
I don't know what you was told but my boxin game cold
You try it you gon'be the first nigga that's gettin stoled
Then I'm back to the whips, slab floatin like a ship
I just released the top now they sayin I'm a trip
They hate the Mac-11 when I got a full clip
4 deep, 1 deep, 1 blood, 1 crip when I tip
I'm the one and I gotta let they ass know
Thinkin somethin slow and I'ma have to let my last go
I'll get ya touched for alittle bit of cash flow
Let the world know I'ma mothafuckin asshole!

(Chorus-Trae)
I'm a gangsta, they don't make these on the block
Gan-gangsta, they don't make these on the block
I'm a gangsta, they don't make these on the block
Gan-gangsta, they don't make these on the block
I'm a gangsta, they don't make these on the block
Gan-gangsta, they don't make these on the block
I'm a gangsta, they don't make these on the block
Gan-gangsta, they don't make these on the block
