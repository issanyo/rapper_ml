[Intro]
Yeah
You know we working that wood nigga
The holy water hehe chicken

[Verse 1]
They stealing my dick
I be feeling heat
Off in the gut I’ll be taking this shit
Nobody can stop me I tell them to quit
Niggas be broke like they can’t be fixed
Gripping that grip while I flipping that porgery
I make them see that quadren
Hustlers I never be that gowers
Fuck what you’re worth i’m charging
Still high behind, they make shit that is blacker
Everyday I make a movie but I’m no actor
Now with the truth you not the factor
One in the head is the risk of the jackers
Ain’t ntn go for the team of traitors
I get a greenlight that’ll go and attack you
Now you have no one to go and back you
Because there are other people paying
Others to pack you
Say what you over there vibing on
How you falling off of bitches I’m falling on
Go to play with my purple lining on
Go long got sports shining over
Pull up with that new rolie timing over
And I think it’s by 48 hours later
In the boost cause it make you greater
Doing me cause I don’t give a fuck about haters

[Hook]
Sipping up this drink up in this place
One thing I want to know is understood
Tipping these hoes and slapping these hoes
Pulling these hoes and man these hoes
Sipping these drinks up in display
One thing I want to know is understood
Tipping these hoes and slapping these hoes
Pulling these hoes and man these hoes

[Verse 2]
Maybe a nigga don’t know how to act
Chuck up in them while I make this pack
One of them nigga they hold me a sack
They sipping cordenes but before they had act
I do not freestyle and I do not matter
My wife is a kilo and bitches are better dre
Get so much money you haters can’t handle that
Live to see the back and bitches be loving that
Rollie be on me when I’m in the grave
40 on me if you trip I’m a bay
Them realer nigga ain’t no getting me paid
Folds poking while I’m holding her leg
All in the game me and you fakers are nothing the same
We are the takers you niggas is laid
Spread you niggas if you play with my name yea

[Hook]
Sipping up this drink up in this place
One thing I want to know is understood
Tipping these hoes and slapping these hoes
Pulling these hoes and man these hoes
Sipping these drinks up in display
One thing I want to know is understood
Tipping these hoes and slapping these hoes
Pulling these hoes and man these hoes

[Verse 3]
East town wad up, you see Lloyd Banks
Yo tolotolo what's cracking
Another forty eight hours
Been there in the streets
After dawn boss

Gripping that great old school rider
Whipping that engine when I pull up beside you
Bitch I’ve been pulling stunts like machiver
Three on the corner there ain’t nothing liver
Slamming the water looking like a diver
These niggas are pussies they are nothing but vagina
Don’t give a fuck hope they can remind you
Open the tit like who can find us
Smoking on something that captain debate
Greenlight yo ass and get shot in the day
Ain’t no mistake bitch I’m riding with trae
Dragging my bumper while scraping the plate
Pull down my stakes gonna be time to play
Knocking knocking now riding with trae
Pussy bunkers when I pull up the play
I’m one deep with vp and cake

[Hook]
Sipping up this drink up in this place
One thing I want to know is understood

Pulling these hoes and man these hoes
Sipping these drinks up in display
One thing I want to know is understood
Tipping these hoes and slapping these hoes
Pulling these hoes and man these hoes
