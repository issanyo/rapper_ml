Don't you know that this shit's fire

[Verse 1 - Reem Da Illist:]

Up in New York, yeah, the Empire State of Mind
Let me turn it around, twist it, yall hatters stay alive
Gettin' them hits, percets, milly's, xanax, rocks
Takeoff, imma lay it down, give it to ya like
Retro dock, AK make yo head pop, yeah
Got that ice, and i'm drippin water on the block
My old mistakes don't haunt me, I take a shot
1 shot, take 2 shots until it's 3 o'clock
I fill up the tank, she call me baby daddy, I gave her the juice
Chicks always wantin' me, but i'm choosin'
I'm I feelin', I might sit beside her
Automatic just popped you and ya dad
I'll think about givin' condolences, RDI in the coop, wit' the boot
Lame nigga, get right witcha
Got that masterpiece, wit' the lock and the major key
Wet like water, steel like ice, that shit like a wilderbeast
If all my niggas know me, I give zero fucks and chills in me
Yeah bro, I see you G

[Outro - Reem Da Illist:]

Up in New York, yeah, the Empire State of Mind
Let me turn it around, twist it, yall hatters stay alive
Gettin' them hits, percets, milly's, xanax, rocks
Takeoff, imma lay it down, give it to ya like
Uh, Retro dock, AK make yo head pop
Got that ice, and i'm drippin water on the block
My old mistakes don't haunt me, I take a shot
1 shot, take 2 shots until it's 3 o'clock
I fill up the tank, she call me baby, I gave her the juice
Chicks always wantin' me, but i'm choosin'
I'm I feelin', I might sit beside her
Automatic just popped you and ya dad
I'll think about givin' condolences, RDI in the coop, wit' the boot
Lame nigga, get right witcha
Got that masterpiece, wit' the lock and the major key
