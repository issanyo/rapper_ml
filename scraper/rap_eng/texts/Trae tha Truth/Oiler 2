[Verse 1]
It's midnight, I'm heading down to your crib
I'm on one, got chad all in my drink
R.I.P to the pimp, underground these motherfuckers
They know I'm bout to be king
Missed call from my main girl but my mindset is on Kim
My ex-girl who branched out and amputated her limb
It's all good, she gon' see the man, the young boy turned in
Still swangin' on these folks, with the same guys I came with
Now what the fuck should I think?

[Hook]
I'm screwed up, you can blame that on the beer
Screwed up, UGK up in my drink
Screwed up, Actavis under my skin
Screwed up, I can never trust a bitch

[Bridge]
Where ya been at? How ya been?
How ya doing, girl? Can I come in?
Where ya been at? How ya been?
How ya doing, girl? Can I come in? Yeah

[Verse 2]
Called her up, I'm down to ride and we all up
Sippin' on that cough syrup, that Big Mo
Pour four for the Pimp too, this Big Hawk, not pimp juice
Hold up, let it sink in, got pink all in my system
Swangin' down that highway, my girl say I move sideways, it's alright
Cup muddy on hard ice, don't give a fuck like I'm [?]
Ain't nothing change but the weather baby
But the young boy got the star life
Same boy who came up was the same man working all night

[Hook + Bridge]

[Verse 3]
Yeah, I'm swangin' on these eighty-fours
Caught up in the past like "How the fuck I'm gon' get away?"
Everybody who left me out tryna reminisce like "Wait!"
Boppers all in my face
No Johnny Dang, no Paul Wall, get yo' grill outta my face
Rap a lot, I'm a prince, boy, and I put that all on J
From Kingston to the A-Town to the H-Town, we straight
Shout out to the greats, DJ Screw, Scarface
Big Mo and Trae, Big Hawk and Pimp C, nigga

[Hook + Bridge]
