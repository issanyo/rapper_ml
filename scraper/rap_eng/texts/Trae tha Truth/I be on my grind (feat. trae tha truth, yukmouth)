[Freddie Gibbs]
Yeah, yeah, yeah...
Yeah, yeah...

Yeah, I be on my grind
I be on that, I be on that full clip and my nine
I be on that break a whole round of kush all down to dimes
Niggas say you lookin for the good-good smoke, tell them hoes that it's on the Eastside
Tell them hoes that I'm on the Eastside, tell them hoes that I'm in the East Bay
Tell them hoes that I'm with Jos in the U-Haul truck finna ship that yay
Tell them hoes that I got that pack, fat O man I brought that back
In the strip club with them racks, hoe know I got that sack
Freddie Kane baby, make you do something strange
For a piece of change baby, bitch I don't do kiss and tell
Say no names baby, I throw that ass under the bizz-us
You fuck and suckin something, that's the mission if you with us
Freddie Kane baby, I make you do something strange
For a piece of change baby, bitch I don't do kiss and tell
Don't say no names baby, I throw that ass under the bizz-us
You fuck and suckin something, that's the mission if you with us
Gangsta Gibbs, uh..

[Chorus: Freddie Gibbs]
Yeah, I be on my grind
I be on that, I be on that full clip and my nine
I be on that break a whole round of kush all down to dimes
Niggas say you lookin for the good-good smoke, tell them hoes that it's on the Eastside
Tell them hoes that I'm on the Eastside, tell them hoes that I'm in the East Bay
Tell them hoes that I'm with Jos in the U-Haul truck finna ship that yay
Tell them hoes that I got that pack, fat O man I brought that back
In the strip club with them racks, hoe know I got that sack

[Trae Tha Truth]
Maneuverin through the block full of gangstas (yeah)
Where they mark their territory like Picasso, spray in the sense of danger
Ever since I got up and got out my major, I was dedicated
Dreamin on the flo' but now the flo's I walk be elevated
Palomino Penthouse, graduated the rent house
Forty stories above the bucket niggas tryin to get out
Policy guarantee haters, get the message to send out
Pull up on 'em, they go the fuck in, that's what I been 'bout
Exquisite taste, somewhere in the jet to match my ego (yeah)
200K, hit the valley, met with my amigo
Somewhere lost to something, that engine move at the speed of light
Bitch get exposed on sight, you know where she gon' be tonight (heh-heh)
That's on God, I bless the game
Take 'em out of ratchet, redesign 'em in something that cost in change
Even if I switch up on 'em, your highness, they will adapt it
Benjamin shoppin, hit the trap, just to tell 'em the paper stackin

[Chorus]
[Yukmouth]
Elegant thuggin, hunnid K in the Louie luggage
I'm +Big Pimpin'+ like Pimp C in the Gucci bucket
My coupe disgusting, Lil' Weezy voice, yep
+Mercy+ with them doors up, not Yeezy, it's your boy Yuk!
Bang~! Dragon Gang in this thang, nigga
Piece, teeth, watch, and the chain Johnny Dang, nigga
Galleria shop up and cop a Versace frame, nigga
'Caine flipper, bricks in back of the Range, I'ma a made nigga
Nigga, and I'm a +Asshole By Nature+
Sellin that +Big Daddy Kane+ on the block, they caught the +Vapors+
Houston, Cali, Vegas, ballin out, fuck you haters
Like 'Bron, I took my talents down South for that paper
Shout out to Chief and J. Prince, your nigga been paid since
Herms, Lou' Vuitton, spikes and suede shit
Your nigga went from cookin hard white in the basement
To rockin mics with the ankle bracelet - gangsta

[Chorus]
