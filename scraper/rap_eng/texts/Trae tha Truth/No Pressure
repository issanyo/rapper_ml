King truth is out to play
I need to fall back but no today
If you ain’t talking bout money I’m out the way
Yeah I’m in the game but not to stay
Only pull up on the block with something to cruise
Yeah I gotta run nice just look at the shoes
On the cool Tell them haters they got it confused
Tell em go against me I bet he gon loose
Niggas talking bout they move but I’m holding the crown
How you speaking for the streets & you running around
Go to disrespecting me & I’m walking em down
When it come to competition they’ll never get found
I know they mad cause they know they ain’t better then me
Every diamond on me water who wetter than me
Look at me I guarantee I’m the level to be
Better know it’ll never be pressure to me

No pressure

Guess who just stepped to the door
Time that I even the score
Everything go
I am like nothing you know
Haters so fall down below
I’m like where did they go
How you the king of the streets
Back for the throne ain’t nobody gon sit in my seat
I should’ve been the contractor for Heat
They know the truth be demolishing beats
I will not stop I feel I’m on a mission
Ain’t no one interrupting my decision
Moving through Houston something like a Goat
Go against that you’ll be on a coalition
I’m at the top
And ain’t nobody higher
Dude think he tough
I tell him to retire
Hottest they come
I know you see the fire
You entertain for me I’m to inspire
