[Hook: Lil Durk]
Gotta keep on runnin' 'fore the feds see me
Smokin' on these drugs I talk to dead people
And I told my kids I will never leave you
Lyin' since a kid, I will never believe you
And you always told me do my thing
Lost the same niggas but had different pain
I will never go against the grain
Even if you can I told you that I can't

[Verse 1: Lil Durk]
And I had yo' back 'cause you my guy too
And I watch yo' back like I'm yo' spy
Dab you in yo' back no not eye
That me put a 4 on the high
We together can't divide
Screamin' loyalty that word they can't define
Dealin' with a million cash we ain't alike
We don't hold it for ourselves we provide
You was my brother since a youngin' since them powers boy
We was turned up in the trenches we were savage boy
Yeah remember them days, on minimum wage
You hungry, give it away
For real, keep it on the plate

[Hook: Lil Durk]
Gotta keep on runnin' 'fore the feds see me
Smokin' on these drugs I talk to dead people
And I told my kids I will never leave you
Lyin' since a kid, I will never believe you
And you always told me do my thing
Lost the same niggas but had different pain
I will never go against the grain
Even if you can I told you that I can't

[Verse 2: Hypno Carlito]
Smokin' up that wood I'm smokin' dead people
Baby momma said slow down before them feds see you
I be in and out countin' nothin' but dead people
I got savages that be slidin' don't let that van see you
I done came up I ain't change I'm still that same nigga
It be niggas talkin' always but never hang with us
All my niggas they be my brothers just like a gang with us
I done did alot for these niggas and ain't get no thanks with it
Lost a whole bunch of niggas fuck 'em all I miss 'em yeah
Always got it on the scope don't miss him yeah
I had yo' back through it all yeah
And my bitch my dog yeah

[Hook: Lil Durk]
Gotta keep on runnin' 'fore the feds see me
Smokin' on these drugs I talk to dead people
And I told my kids I will never leave you
Lyin' since a kid, I will never believe you
And you always told me do my thing
Lost the same niggas but had different pain
I will never go against the grain
Even if you can I told you that I can't

[Verse 3: Trae Da Truth]
Everywhere I look my niggas fallin'
It's hard to leave the streets when they callin'
Choppa on my seat I guess I'm (?) goes in
They told me it was my time but they was stallin'
I thought you was my brother nothin' else
You had stabbed me behind my back you hit my chest
It was dirty the way you did me like the rest
But you know when you play me better send yo' best
Everywhere a nigga go I gotta stay extended on the waist
My brother gone and you ain't ride, why the fuck you in my face?
How the fuck are we so far apart when you used to be my ace?
Loyalty the only way but you movin' at a different pace

[Hook: Lil Durk]
Gotta keep on runnin' 'fore the feds see me
Smokin' on these drugs I talk to dead people
And I told my kids I will never leave you
Lyin' since a kid, I will never believe you
And you always told me do my thing
Lost the same niggas but had different pain
I will never go against the grain
Even if you can I told you that I can't
