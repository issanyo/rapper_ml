She said if you don’t know mo city don she can’t fuck with you

She said if weak shit you on then no no she can’t fuck with you

Said you grew up on that barre baby

Thats why I fuck with you, you know exactly who you are baby

Girl you a blessing let me undress you

You hot like 25 lighters

So Ima put you on the dresser

Tell me can you feel the pressure

Ima fuck you in the hall

Crazy how I’m the one driving and she still gripping wood now

I let the top down I feel the wind blow shawty she faded gone off that into

Girl I got more you should go and let your friends know

‘Cause girl it ain't no thang with me

Hop in that whip just gripping grain with me

Sipping switching lanes with me

Oh girl but don’t play with me now





My brother used to tell me bout these

Horse power ain't no Ralph lauren

Full speed bitch I’m not stalling

And the came centers keep fallin

I was draped up and dripped out

That Texas shit what I’m bout

Plenty diamonds all in my mouth

Better know I’m reppin that south

Niggas know I’m on the block all day

You ever try to jack me bitch ill spray

Can’t blame me

The hood raised me

Play shady

This can go crazy



My brother used to tell me bout these

Houston women from the nawf to the southeast

Yeah they always down to ride and they love to ball

So many of em I just wanna love em all
