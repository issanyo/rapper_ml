[Intro: Trae tha Truth speaking]
Yeah
The undisputed king
Nigga I am the street, shit - haha
Trae tha Truth
Pyrexx
Yeah

[Verse 1: Trae tha Truth]
If you looking for the realest I'm here to give you the biz
King of whatever them niggas yelling they is
Any nigga got a problem, well then tell 'em who it is
I didn't stutter motherfucker, you can tell 'em who it is
Got a temper that'll beat a nigga up under the flow
With a pipe that I probably sticking up under your ho
If they wanna get it in, tell em I'm ready to go
Got a trap, I put it somewhere up under the snow
When they come to get money, then tell em I'm all in
Drama you looking for, this topic will fall in
If it go to work, then I bet that you called in
In the back of this Phantom out the side that I crawled in
If I did it, don't worry about it, tell em it's all me
If I did it, you heard about it, tell em it's all G
Put you out of sight for a hell of a small fee
People give a fuck about if you had a show or tell em that it's free
Come and switch it up, you niggas fucking with my minute, get it back
Tell em I was sick, even sicker when I hit a track
Never been one to give a fuck about what you feeling
Cause if you feeling anything different, I ain't feeling that
Yeah the king back
Team is all black
Green is all racks
Rachine is all that
Anything I'm in like to transform when the sun go
Fourth wheel stunt while the fifth one lean back
I bet you never seen a nigga who talk for night
No matter where you at, I bet I'll light up your life
I'm a star, at the same time hood with it
Set it off, I bet like Mary you're praying to Christ
So my advice, if you see me with Pyrexx
The gang's somewhere round and ready for whatever bitch
So just know when you fuck with gorillas
Gorillas gone show you what's really whatever bitch

[Hook]
I'm strapped up, black mask
Still gangsta, in the hood
Set tripping, still thugging
Real nigga, understood

What they talking, I ain't tripping
Chopper loaded, I ain't slipping
Now you're leaking, should've listened
Fucking with the game will leave you missing

Strapped up, black mask
Still gangsta, in the hood
Set tripping, still thugging
Real nigga, understood

What they talking, I ain't tripping
Chopper loaded, I ain't slipping
Now you're leaking, should've listened
Fucking with the game will leave you missing

[Verse 2: Pyrexx]
I'm tatted up, all white
Pistol loaded, what they talking
I ain't tripping, Trae I got 'em
Like I'm getting money when I'm up from the bottom
P-Y-R-E-double-X, Pyrexx, you can tell I'm a beast with the flow
Every in caine's in my vo', when I go, I'm a show, with them motherfucking diggers in the globe now
Got Trae on this track with this white boy
Yeah well it's like out of this world you would think I'm black
But I ain't, but I got a black heart with a blue blood bumping out this motherfuckin' track
Uh, yeah, I'm not bitch, "Free Pyrexx" was a movement bitch
Whatcha wanna do, fucking with a fool
One phone call Trae get the click mobbin' bitch
I'm from the hood, northside
Northwest psychers home
That's right
Don't get it twisted, on mine
I can run with the gorillas from the southside
So I ride with a cocked nine, never stop mine
Fitting to rise and to shine, I'm a get it in
Never will I give, get it how I live
After doing this bid y'all gonna really star, starâ€¦

But even in my raps, my style, my flow is gone but everybody know
Till I'm out on me, everything give away big up to the tone we gone get this dough homie

Best believe when I step out I'm a shine bright with a mouth full of gold
Six point stars on the teeth
Known for the cheef
Fuck with the camp on the ground when you go
