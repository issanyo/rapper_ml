I'm just sittin' back thinkin like
Who'da ever thought I'd be able
To create some so special
Everytime I sit and watch it man
Swear y'all remind me of me
My lil homies man

Look all praise out to the Father
When you in a life full of hate why
Bother
Seeds planted like farmers
Though I gotta be smarter for the
Ones that I birthed
Even when it darker
Even if it fade black
Ain't no need of a barber
I'ma deal wit it
They know they daddy real wit it
They still get a pridw
They still say this whatever the
Fine
Though soon enough get it with
Time
And to my little niggas
The one rockin my life than
Quicker than suicide
For love of everything don't tell
Em when I do the ride They all bliss I can't tell you what
They do inside
If  I don't make you well hidden loafer then my tribe
Won't lead most of they assume
Is what they mean to me
Just the thought of me bein dead
Was a dream to me
Lay everytime I look at her look
Lik a team to me
I'm only playin' they proud of
What they see in me

It's like
I'm just sittin in the studio vibin'
Right now
Ain't nuthin better
Lookin that whole videos of
Pictures
And there ain't nuthin better
My young little niggas never
Cease to amaze '
Ain't nuthin better
For real
Yeah, there ain't nuthin better

Conversatin' wit my brother
Bout how lil niggas kick it
Even it's bullshit it don't matter
Them niggas wit it
Used to stea; runnin this  game
We never quit it
Niggas still mean as hell don't you
Foget it
J finally made it to a team feelin
They fly
His mama still on his ass
He don't even comply
Probably some where on the
Phone hollerin' at lil chicks
Yeah the all in the mix
And I ain't mad at em
Baby need still
How did I train for days
I still can't believe TO'd and cut
Off his braids
Now you're lookin like a lil man
The happy feelin that I got you
Couldn't understand
I showed the world when they come
To family I'm dedicated
The position the real father
I was educated
Unconditional with the love
Never hesitated
If we ever separated I would be
Devastated

Sit there thinkin like
Ain't nuthin better
Damn
Now I need the babies I used to love
Man
And there ain't nuthin better
The crew they out there they're
Grown
Fly as hell
Ain't  nuthin better
They're too damn fly if you ask
Me
And ain't nuthin better

You know nothin my light that
Can give me the smile
Until I look at y'all Even though you're
G
You know I'm here to pick up the
Slack
And you the fold man
You ain't different at all
And I'm ridin through the town
Watchin Houston gettin grown
Every chance I get I try to get em
On the phone
What they got me goin through
With him is kinda wrong
That's why when we together we
Be in another zone
Only pray I get to see my kids
Graduate
Anything stoppin it'll prolly have
To wait
I'm tryna tighten up a bond that
They could break
I'm tryna keep her understandin' if
You went straight
I rather to you
I lay you before I float in the sky
And if I tell you somethin'
Different I'd be livin a lie
Everyone of y'all the biz
Little somethin' came by
Y'all the reason I was livin
I ain't ready to die

No lie
Ain't nuthin better
I gotta thank God everyday for
What He blessed me with
And there ain't nuthin better
Yeah, you know you the leader of
The pack man
Take care of your brothers
Ain't nuthin better
Baby, Nicole
Houston
I love you
And there ain't nuthin better
Ain't nuthin better
And there ain't nuthin better
Ain't nuthin better
And there ain't nuthin better
