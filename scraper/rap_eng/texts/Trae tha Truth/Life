[Verse 1: Trae tha Truth]
I'm unable to kick the bucket so I wake up to stress
Out of patience feeling like everybody else getting blessed
Took a breath, throw on my locs, get my pistol and vest
I'm in The Matrix dodging bullets 'til they put me to rest
I ain't happy to be here but I'm thankful I'm still alive
I need to be here for my son, Nico barely made it to five
Everything fading away in the dark when I step outside
I'm too lost to see where to go, I just hop in the car and drive
Mad, shit, as I think of my brother, Lord tell him I love him
Maximum security got it where I can't even hug him (damn!)
The devil hate me, but fuck it, I don't think nothing of him
I hate that bitch too, end of discussion (yeah)
He left me without a sister, just images of her murder
Knowing she cried for help, I'm just wishing I could've heard her
So related to the pain, the gutter love me like a son
That's why they say the only place that understand me is the slums
These don't problems don't go away (go away)
Cop him a spot and chill (spot and chill)
Duck off and go to sleep (go to sleep)
Wake up and show it's real (show it's real)
I take it for what it is, ain't no use in me trying to heal
I could be deep in my grave way up in heaven and feel it still
I'm kinda sick, the shit I'm on will lead to medication (fuck)
I'm on this road to life without no registration
I'm in this hall of shame like I had a reservation
The streets is dead, they overdue for a resuscitation

[Verse 2: Jadakiss]
Uh, uh, HA-HAAAEEH!
Yo, it ain't one thing or another, either the law or ya baby mother (uh huh)
Dumping the clip, burning rubber (yeah)
Raised in the gutter, grew to be a shooter and the cutter
All the OG niggas love ya (ha)
But you know that there's more to discover (more)
And you getting tired of living your life according to others (uh)
Things going on in ya mind, you can't talk about
Soon as a nigga cross the line, you gon' chalk him out
Push-ups and crunches, never travel in bunches (nah)
Stay out of the sight of the cops, no hunches (yep)
Four Season brunches (ha), niggas with millions up in the hundreds (woo!)
Just being there will make you want this (come on)
Came a long way from the swim mobile and free lunches (uh)
To a whole song with three punches
With that being said, handle your fucking biz (yeah)
As long as the hood know what it is, life

[Outro: Female singer]
Oh yeah, oh yeah
Oh yeah, oh yeah
You gotta break me down
