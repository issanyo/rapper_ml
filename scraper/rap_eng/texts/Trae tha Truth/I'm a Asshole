Yeah you already know, this Trae mayn
Asshole By Nature, Slow Loud And Bangin'
Doing my motherfucking thang, feel what I'm saying
This here, for my motherfucking gangstas
My Crips my Bloods my folks, thugs
Whatever the fuck, you wanna call it
We gon get this bitch wired up
Get to slapping the shit, out somebody

[Trae]
I come around the corner, like Jordan in '87
Bailing on 23 inches, and holding for all my felons
Me and lil' bro, been the heat of the West
I got these niggas off the chain, cause I'm the Truth of the West
With a black on black, in back of the back of it with they scope
24 plus strap, cause these niggas know how it go
You see this year I got the music, that'll go get these niggas fired and wired up
Whooping niggas for days, and they ain't chunking they side up
Have these niggas on Anthem, about to start em a riot up
Loading and busting some'ing, that'll be fucking your hide up
My drop be dyed up, the same color as Hoovers
With a houpe a couple cars behind, with gorillas packing rugers
I know these bitches wanna stop us, but I fly right past em
With the left dropped and the right cocked, jamming that S.L.A.B. "The Anthem"
They been waiting so I'ma grant tem, with Z-Ro in a Phantom
This here be Assholes bitch, and we can click on the random

[Hook]
I'm a Asshole

Bitch, I'm a motherfucking Asshole

[Jay'Ton]
Who the fuck is Joe Boy Alleycat, bitch where your mama at
You better fall back, 'fore she end up in all black
I'm never caught slipping, wood grain gripping
Still Hoover Cripping, fin to leave your whip flipping
I'm scooting up the block, with my locs and twin gats
Some of my dogs flame, but I promise they bring cash
It's Jay'Ton bitch, and I'm exposing all rats
Running with twelve pounds, hit the wood and I bounce back
Now, show me where your heart at cuz
Cause I'll put into drama, where it start at cuz
Niggas ain't even a threat, so I'm checking em off
And pick that bitch up off the ground and kiss the dust in her mouth cause I'm a asshole

[W.G.]
I'm so gangsta, flipping in my suicide brougham
It's Dub G from A.B.N., packing on chrome
I done waited my time, I'm sitting back on the scenes
Got everybody, wondering what all that red means
Stop hating me bitch, not from Sunnyside but I'll check a ho
With a cocked fo'-fo', in a fo' do'
I ain't tripping, but what I got waiting in the back
Will raise the back of, any nigga that's a Silverback
You wanna know, why we lean so much
Cause grey Screw tapes and red cars, and that purple stuff
And I've been known to send shots your way
We gon rep the Southwest, and hold it down for Grey

[Boss]
Boss in a Regal that's black, I got Blood in the back
Ready to pump the right side of that Lumina, so let it crack cuz
Cuz what it is, what it was
Fuck the fuzz send a slug and put that nigga in the dust cuz
I'm from the H mayn, killers hopping gates mayn
Bossing on niggas, got us where we standing today mayn
When my finger split that thumb, you better run
I got thirteen TTP's, PVL's with guns
Niggas head hunting, we taking souls from niggas set fronting
First time we said we wanted one, y'all niggas ain't said nothing
HGC gon start bucking, fucking with my cousin
I'ma kit-katting and cutting, and if a crisis come I'm dumping
