[Verse 1: Trae tha Truth]
Sitting, fighting this pressure in the state of exhaust
How many times I talked to God, speaking on those that I lost
A couple brother, couple sisters then a bunch of my homies
That's why I move up out my lonely, hoping God'll come show me
A new direction cause I feel like I'm losing faith by the minute
Tryna hide away from reality in something that's tinted
I conversate most of the time across the mind of a seal
Same niggas that showed me love, you might just find em in hell
I hate to see us, or to blame em on everything they been through
In a different circumstance a better life, they might just been you
Tryna provide, missing homicide by minutes
Or they tryna get stripes from a basic Sargent to lieutenant
I do this here for my nigga Dawg, my nigga Clip
Ain't too many others that are sold, that's why I trip
I trip out, but try to keep my cool knowing pain is here
Wanted the sun, but since I missed this shit the rain is here

[Hook: Mitchy Slick]
Abnormal heart, diagnosed at birth
All my niggas got em whole family cursed
T-shirt with their nan just ain't the same
Shoulda have em attack out all the stress and strain
Fuck this fame and this change
Fuck this chain and this Range
With all my real ones gone I can't sleep the same
I wish this fuckin rain' would go away

[Verse 2: Trae tha Truth]
Lost is what I feel, looking at where I'm headed
Talked to God begging for help so much I feel like I'm out of credit
He don't know me and I understand, I just need a helping hand
Talked to my grandfather day later, now we on the sand
The homie calls mama's stress
And even though he gone, he still around so yeah we blessed
It's a cold world
They say it get better but I just save the drama tired
From all the pain the I acquired, left the Devil fired
I swear it's life to end the days
Of tryna make it out but I can't get up out this maze
It's me against the world and I can't get up out this phaze
Niggas jumping fly like they can't get up out them J's
I'm on my defence
May my sons forgive me, I don't wanna be no failure
But being real throughout the pain, it hurt like hell I tell ya
It's hard to see when you're surrounded by the dark
It's that type of shit that take ya air support
For real mayne

[Hook]
