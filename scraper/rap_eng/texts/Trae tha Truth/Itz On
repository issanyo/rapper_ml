(*talking*)
Yeah, I know they ain't think I was gon let they ass make it
Motherfucker you must be stupid, put your game face on bitch
This first and ten, hoe ass niggas

[Trae]
Niggas acting like they forgot, I'm the reason the streets relaxing
I brought it back for the hood, to let some real niggas get action
I'm certified with these streets, so why the fuck is niggas asking
I been riding since I was 12, now the fuck you think I'm lasting
Watching niggas turn gangsta daily, cause they practice flashing
But talking against the Truth, will have em starving like they fasting
I fuck around and come just start up they career, dead then I'm crashing
Then have em just looking stupid, till every rapper come pass em
Say homie you better watch me, I'll show you how to do this shit
And tell them two-faces non-rapping ass niggas, stay off my dick
I can't believe these niggas ego's, that pump em up like they got beef
Lord knows if I get started, who the fuck can they get to stop me
This here's a warning shot, niggas better be on they A-game
I'm the leader of the gang, and I'm running with Lil' J mayn
I'm only here to win, if I lose then I ain't gon play mayn
I'm sick of asking niggas, who hating and they say mayn
Bitches ain't no better, but they got some'ing like they know me
They be the first to say they fucking got money, knowing they fony
These bitches worst than that gold digger, trying to get all up on me
Then they wonder why they five dollar, roaching ass by they lonely
I'm here to give em the truth, and reflect em like I'm a mirror
And fuck a new set of glasses, I'm helping you see it clearer
And if I spit it respect it, cause it ain't getting no realer
I been around the hood and back, and I stay posted up with killers
These niggas talking that hot shit, like Restless ain't what they banging
Knowing that when they flipping alone, I be what they singing
I got the Southwest on my back, so you know I know where you hanging
I know you contaminated, I hope you don't call it stinging
Even if I never see gold, the streets gon keep me paid off
And if I don't see platinum, I'll still never get laid off
Now who you think they ride for the trill, if shit didn't break off
Decided over here motherfucker, now watch you fade off

(*talking*)
I think you motherfuckers, picked the wrong nigga
On the wrong motherfucking day, on the wrong motherfucking block
Now you ass hoping it stop, but shit ain't gon stop nigga
You pumped your ass up, to fuck with the Truth nigga
I'ma give you the bidness, I can't do nothing less you know what I'm saying
This what it is, nigga know this shit go way back with me nigga
Holla at the motherfucking O.G. Dinkie, and see what the bidness is
This Asshole By Nature nigga, motherfuckers ain't worth no two verses
They ain't even worth a chorus, I'm play with ya you know
I'm having fun right now, but you piss me off
Your ass'll be starving out here nigga, fuck with me
