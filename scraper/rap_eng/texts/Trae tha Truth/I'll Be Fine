It Hurt But I Won't Cry
Wish I Could Turn Back Time
Just To Say What's On My Mind
I Know I'll Be Fine
It Hurt But I Won't Cry
Wish I Could Turn Back Time
Just To Say What's On My Mind
I Know I'll Be Fine

Listen My Dog's It Ain't The Same
Where Did He Go Feeling So Lost
Ain't No Mistakin
I Been Here Before
Wish I Could Hook him and tell
Him i love him
I need him around
Never forget bout the moment
This casket went into the ground
Screw how you do it
Heard you were still someone
With your pet

Yeah i'm still reppin'
Drunk in the air
Body rockin' the slack
That was a fact
Told them leave nothin if they
Ain't screwed up
Just know that I got you

Every So comic i wish you could
Touch
What about mister three two
Mafia still got the claw
Tell 'em we still comin through

SUC still got it locked
Everyday make 'em respected
And though i'm messin' with truth
Know i was holdin for Texas

It Hurt But I Won't Cry
Wish I Could Turn Back Time
Just To Say What's On My Mind
I Know I'll Be Fine
It Hurt But I Won't Cry
Wish I Could Turn Back Time
Just To Say What's On My Mind
I Know I'll Be Fine

It Hurt But I Won't Cry
Wish I Could Turn Back Time
Just To Say What's On My Mind
I Know I'll Be Fine
It Hurt But I Won't Cry
Wish I Could Turn Back Time
Just To Say What's On My Mind
I Know I'll Be Fine

Fight me seals
Thinkin bout quip
But i'm still tryna smile
Knowin that so much to change
Reminiscing bout days we was
Wild
I'll make you proud
Move for you
I was head first in the crowd
Silent but loud
Look in the sea
If your face in the cloud
Me and lil Nico gon pull up in
Somethin

Still rippin the wrists
Tatted your face on my chest
I can't lie to you
I'm stressed
But i try to do my best

You and us was all we needed
I'll be damned we get defeated
These memories i can't delete it
Time ain't enough
Wish i could tell you how much it
Been rough

I had to face it
Everything do it
Was makin me tough
My brother my friend
Everything bout me is still A.B.N
Lure you to death
All for the day imma see you again

It Hurt But I Won't Cry
Wish I Could Turn Back Time
Just To Say What's On My Mind
I Know I'll Be Fine
It Hurt But I Won't Cry
Wish I Could Turn Back Time
Just To Say What's On My Mind
I Know I'll Be Fine

It Hurt But I Won't Cry
Wish I Could Turn Back Time
Just To Say What's On My Mind
I Know I'll Be Fine
It Hurt But I Won't Cry
Wish I Could Turn Back Time
Just To Say What's On My Mind
I Know I'll Be Fine

I Know I'll Be Fine
I Know I'll Be Fine
I Know I'll Be Fine
I Know I'll Be Fine
