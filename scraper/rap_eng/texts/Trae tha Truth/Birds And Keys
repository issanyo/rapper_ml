[Chorus] (x2)
Little bird
Have you got a key?
Where will you go?
Keep yourself afloat

[Verse 1: Frenchie]
It's time for me to step up
Everything happens for a reason, I fell back now I gotta catch up
Niggas want me dead, I'm riding 'round with that pistol every day, I'll have your white tee looking like ketchup
Spilled on it
Table got a deal on it
But I'ma stay humble cause money don't make me, I got a feel for it
I got four damn kids that I live for
You think I won't kill for 'em?
I don't gotta talk, if I pull it out I'ma pop it
Let off a hundred rounds, I guarantee you'll see the carpet
And you get too close, I bet Wooh Da pull out the carbon
Shooting at everything, don't get this nigga started
I put that everything, my niggas go retarded
Cuckoo, insane, something is wrong with my brain
My daddy made me with Vodka and cocaine
The hood where I'm from, you give [?] no names
If you do something, niggas will clap your man
Run at a funeral just to make sure he dead and clap again
A little nigga will pull up on a strip with some shit on his hip
Like he got it fresh out of Pakistan (for real?)
Trying hard, do my best just not to clap a man
[?] my nigga, they say they got him for trafficking
When they let him out, the industry gon' let him in
I pray that he'll never have to clap again

[Chorus] (x2)

[Verse 2: Trae Tha Truth]
It's too much fiction in the air, it's like I'm choking
Homie might end up leaving you burned like he was smoking
Hope you not sleeping cause if you do you gon' get woken
Show up at your door, I swear to God you better not open
Look, it ain't nothing for play, thought they was playing for keeps
Everything [?] for real, niggas ain't taking defeat
Niggas might make it ugly, you thinking that [?]
Fuck a 9 to 5, young niggas be gunning for cheap
All I know is do what I do and I get the fuck on
Every hater all on my dick, I tell  'em to suck on
Anyone fuck up my vicinity getting bucked up
Pull up with that [?] nigga your luck on
I hear them niggas say I was tripping, fuck it, tell 'em I'm tripping now
You in need of [?], you can tell 'em I'm pimping now
Trying to get off this artillery, I'm moving in foreign whip
Trip and I'ma end up getting a flip now

[Chorus] (x2)
