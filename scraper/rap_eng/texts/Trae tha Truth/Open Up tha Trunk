Open up the trunk see the way we hit the brakes
Cause you love the way you wait wait
Open up the trunk see the way we hit the brakes
Cause you love the way you wait wait
Open up the trunk see the way we hit the brakes
Cause you love the way you wait wait
Open up the trunk see the way we hit the brakes
Cause you love the way you wait wait

[Verse 1]
Yea that rate I’m gonna get my respect
Any nigga that run up on me get the whip
You don’t get it from the hands you get it from the tip
Guaranteed I’m a win place your bet
If you wait for the trap pound for pound
Pull the slab out the shop you bound to drown
When the club raised up i’m bound to clown
Put a price on your head and calm you down
Praise me in the streets and I’ll save you nigga
It doesn't matter if it's trae they phaze you nigga
Think you better than the truth they played you nigga
Get your money up forget it I raised you nigga
I’m in the zone you can hear it all in my voice
I’m the king of the street you got no choice
I’m the nigga that roll the royce
I feel to dive in something moist

[Hook]
Open up the trunk see the way we hit the brakes
Cause you love the way you wait wait
Open up the trunk see the way we hit the brakes
Cause you love the way you wait wait
Open up the trunk see the way we hit the brakes
Cause you love the way you wait wait
Open up the trunk see the way we hit the brakes
Cause you love the way you wait wait

[Verse 2]
Niggas pussy I don’t like you
Keep it rockin might just ignite you
King cobra might just bite you
Infrared might just sight you
Spend my whole life trying to make a
Hundred grand on a slow night
Afterwards you can tell them i’m low life
Squeeze up to the silver life
I hear a bunch of niggas try
But they wouldn't be
You want to get up in the game I’m an OG
I’m a play to the end nigga OT
You want to tip me nigga and you don’t know me
You can talk or you don’t want to talk back
Walk your ass over here and you don’t walk back
Nigga I was on a roll pull up at your house like like like
Pull up at your house nigga where your hoes at
Got a team and a wrist nigga frooze that
Fuck niggas want to hate I suppose that
Top up my shit can’t close that
Neco get the stick don’t know that
It’s a bunch of shit that I don’t feel getting real
Fuck these haters now I work my way up
Seventeen on my k and put it all in my grill
And now young og gonna tell

[Hook]
Open up the trunk see the way we hit the brakes
Cause you love the way you wait wait
Open up the trunk see the way we hit the brakes
Cause you love the way you wait wait
Open up the trunk see the way we hit the brakes
Cause you love the way you wait wait
Open up the trunk see the way we hit the brakes
Cause you love the way you wait wait
