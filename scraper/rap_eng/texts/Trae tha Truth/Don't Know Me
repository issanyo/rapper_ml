[Hook:  Young Thug]
Started from the bottom of the clock
Now I'm at the top of the globe
You don't know me, nah, you don't know me
I gave her everybody money I paid all my kinfolk
No, you don't know me
I did it from the heart
I did it from the heart
I did it from the heart, ey
You don't know me
You think I did it to say I did it, and shit on you, but
You do not me, you do not know me

[Verse 1: Trae tha Truth]
I feel like I'm going crazy, so much shit I remember
Nothing when these niggas pretenders
They stay forgetting what you did when they counted
It's hard to see they had a different agenda
Oh my brother dead that I lost in November
I did everything from the heart
[?] nigga but keep it real [?]
Thought you was down with me but that's false
What you niggas done to me, it's gone cost
Tell a nigga fuck respect, cause that's lost
Can't overlook shit, some shit you don't cross
Who the fuck are you to tell me what the hell I done
And who the fuck a nigga [?]
But only pointed fingers when they really needed you
You didn't help, and I didn't even trip about it
I was living for the hood you was getting out it
Go ahead, walk around and flip you out it
Everybody say they real, shit getting crowded
I highly doubt it, everything is fake
Instead of tryna give you only here to take
I'm nothing perfect, yeah I know we make mistakes
Something different we just call it [?]
Guess I gotta deal with it
I'm the king of the streets and I'm still with it
Tolerate none of it you a still get it
You was out of line, guess that's on my mind
How you moving like you blind
They gone see your kind, you the type without a spine

[Hook: Young Thug]
Started from the bottom of the clock
Now I'm at the top of the globe
You don't know me, nah, you don't know me
I paid all my kinfolk
No, you don't know me
Yeah, they don't owe me
I did it from the heart
I did it from the heart
I did it from the heart, ey
You don't know me
You think I did it to say I did it, and shit on you, but
You do not me, you do not know me

[Verse 2: Young Thug]
You don't know nothing 'bout me
You don't know what I've been through, yeah
You don't see nothing but money, yeah
You don't see nothing but these jewels, yeah
You don't see these jews behind me
Taking all these fucking millions from me
You don't see these bitches 'round me
Acting like they really kin to me
You don't see these pussy niggas frontin'
You don't see these monkey bitches flexin'
You don't see these pussy niggas trippin'
You don't see the wreckage
You don't see my niggas grew up treacherous
Aye, we was in the motherfuckin' trench gettin' it, aye
If he my fake brother, I'ma slide on 'em, yeah
Soon as he leave I'ma send slime right to his spot yeah
I want everything in the bitch, clean 'em out yeah
You gonna have to do a lot better cause I'm at the top now
But I swear you don't know me
I swear fore God, you don't know me
You don't know what I been through so you don't know me
I paid for everything around me they don't owe me
I paid for everything they got
I paid for all their cars, all their clothes
All my motherfucking shows
All the T-shirts I sold that I gave to them and split it broke
And they don't owe me, I swear to God they don't owe me

[Outro]
You don't know, you don't know
You don't know, you don't know
They don't know
They don't know
They don't know
