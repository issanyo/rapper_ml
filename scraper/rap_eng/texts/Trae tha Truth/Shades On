Shades On

[Verse 1: MobSquad Nard]
N u kno We got da top back ridin wit my shades on ion even see em let dem niggas get dey hate on 
It all started wit da grind yea we make moves
But u kno ween got shit to prove
Dis for my niggas who keep everything clean thang cocked back
Pockets on swole n ya game all dat
Stay cool young nigga get da ups from me 
Stack ya bread n stay bustafree 

[Verse 2: MobSquad Nard]
Fuck what dey holla make a dollar den its Makin sense
Opinions from a know it all ain't never payed da rent
A nigga watchin other niggas he ain't really focus
Just let him talk gone tell his hand before he really notice
I got a hustle so my worries a thang of da past
All I'm worried bout paper cuts while I finger da cash
Nigga say I'm spoady I cock da banga den laugh 
One flip out da head just in case u was thankin 
I'm off my rock cuz I'm drankin 
I got my bop from my daddy
He told me shit feel better u take care of ha pad
I got some cluckas do what ever anything for da cash
My homie had a hard life and he passed
Nigga I do it for you
We all tryna make it do what it do it do
Some real niggas fall tryna make it do what it do 
Nigga we ball all you niggas misconstruing the crew 
But I ain't trippin nigga do what you do 

[Chorus]
