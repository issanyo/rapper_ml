[Trae / Young Jeezy:]
Cheeah!*
Street shit
(I got this yeah I got this)
I got this (I got this yeah I got this)
I got this (We ain't worry about em) naw
(We ain't worry about em) naw
(We ain't worry about em) naw
(We ain't worry about em!)

[Chorus (2x): ~Young Jeezy~]
I got this look look I got this (YEEAAHHH!)
I got this look look I got this (so don't worry)
I got this look look I got this (YEEAAHHH!)
I got this look look I got this (so don't worry)

[Verse 1: Trae]
I tried to tell em I got this
I got this
Trae Tha Truth
I'm feeling like everythang relevant irrelevant nowadays
I thought I had a chance but now they showing me crime pays
The shit I'm living got me feeling like a old man
I been the H so where I'm fighting for my own man
They told me chill but this anger in my heart steel
My closes niggas turning on me like I'm cartwheel
I never played with disrespect nigga this score is real
If I was plexing and I still woulda fuck out'cha steal
I'm old school I never post up on this sneak shit
That's all in Houston you can miss me with that weak shit
Keep shooting undercover slugs dissing ass niggas
On the hood you bout to be some missing ass niggas
It don't take much to see these niggas out here fake as hell (fuck em)
All they ways goin have a nigga going straight to jail
I read these bitches like the numbers that's working the scale
And tell em being real ain't rated by the way ya sale
You looking for attention I'm about to make em famous
Soon as this shit get in the fan the pussy niggas blame us
I kept it loyal but these niggas loyal to theyself
I did it out of love they only did it for they wealth

[Chorus x2: Young Jeezy]
I got this look look I got this (YEEAAHHH!)
I got this look look I got this (so don't worry)
I got this look look I got this (YEEAAHHH!)
I got this look look I got this (so don't worry)

[Verse 2: Young Jeezy]
(So don't worry) bout these hoe niggas, been there before niggas
All they gotta do is ask I'm writing show niggas (ha ha)
Just to show niggas, that I can show niggas
What else I gotta say you seen my show nigga
1 2 3 4 here we go niggas
And I ain't never been a hater I'm like 'Yo nigga! '
Who's hot who's not I'm like so nigga
See they just warming up I'm hot as coal nigga
Probably why I'm platinum never been a gold nigga
The only thang he ever sold was your soul nigga
And they don't want me getting open I might close niggas
They won't give me no expose I might expose niggas

[Chorus x2: Young Jeezy]
I got this look look I got this (YEEAAHHH!)
I got this look look I got this (so don't worry)
I got this look look I got this (YEEAAHHH!)
I got this look look I got this (so don't worry)
So don't worry
So don't worry
So don't worry
