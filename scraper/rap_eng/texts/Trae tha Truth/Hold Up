[Hook: Trae Tha Truth]
I’m feeling like I’m fly as fuck, no planes
Yelling where them haters at, ain’t nothing changed
Still talking white bricks, cocaine
In the club with one hundred racks, I’m just saying
Yeah bitch I might
(Hold up(x6) Yeah)(x2)

[Verse 1: Young Jeezy]
I’m just saying, hold up
California ‘rari bitch top just fold up
Nigga with an attitude Michael Kors polo
Top’ll get to popping  make them freeze up like a photo
Nightmares about the feds smelling like Hermes
Black with a check now you Cortez
The exorcist nigga  when I roll it turn heads
Put some Ninas ‘til they  froze like staring at Medusa hair
You see me in these streets on these beats
With them hoes of the kitchen
A pussy nigga think different pussy nigga tripping
It’s Jizzle from the bottom  die a legend out this bitch
I get to whipping up that fo’ and get a seven out that bitch

[Hook: Trae Tha Truth]

[Verse 2: Trae Tha Truth]
King of the streets, it’s when it drops I’m startin’
Bitch I ball for the city just like my last name Harden
So much green inside the trunk it should’ve stayed in the garden
All I do is pay the price  never ask what they charging
I pull up on your bitch and repossess her like you owe that
Put her in a flick and  display her like she was Kodak
King motherfucker I’m classic like I was throwback
This ain’t what you want pussy nigga, you better know that
Too deep in this ‘rari, something blowing like Bob Marley
Hit my youngin’ with a chopper Tell him ride like Harley
I do this for my niggas in the city of the slow shit
Well they pulled up and they bang something
Them laws come we don’t know shit
Street nigga problems, we don’t never duck ‘em
I’m an asshole, Trae forever young  and fuck ‘em
Nuts hanging to the point it ain’t no where to stuff ‘em
I let my chain play nigga, I don’t ever tuck ‘em

[Hook: Trae Tha Truth]

[Verse 3: T.I.]
Jays in the yard, Ki’s in the kitchen
AKs’ in the closet a quarter million in the ceiling
All the yay we distributing  no wonder how they never caught me
All I gotta say is pay your taxes  pay your lawyer fee
Think im runnin’ round a nigga, I know the mayor I can call it
Yeah that’s above the law call it what you call it
Don’t take no shit  ’cause I ain’t no toilet
See me shawty you see me ballin’!
I pulled up, hopped out sharp as shit
Rolls Royce so big  can’t park the shit
You ain’t ’bout that life  quit startin’ shit
Cause we ain’t gon’ wanna hear that "I'm sorry" shit

[Hook]

[Outro: Diddy]
Ay yo, ABN
Trae The Truth
Kings, baby
I got stadium place, bitches
And I ain’t just talkin’ to women neither
