I'm respected in these streets, nigga they treat me like a king [x5]
They treat me like a king
They they treat me like a king

I'm respected in these streets, nigga they treat me like a king

[Verse 1]
I'm the definition of real life still on my toe
Got six old niggas looking down so from the bottom I'm rollin
This is the truth the ghetto nightmare better lead the expose
They don't need to come to the streets only this six in this close
The hood only me I'm close to person I'm never from being
TeeI ain't about to be a store I jump that hit to be a G
You can play this thing but they still gonna be realest ever
Never saluted by gangstas plus I'm respected and TDC
Look at they craze being in streets like I'm the only one that they feel But the do lane and all the hate but my gangsta remain still
A post to child be a definition to when they say it's real
When I rap up I'll beat the hood and this nigga brooke the pee pill
The streets is gate to me to the mother niggas they hate Benz
Tell the fuck they respect I dump that shit say place my trash shit
Can like this chick it's time pick up I'm your shit before you can shit The king is here they play the throne you try to seat your ass

[Hook]
I'm respected in these streets, nigga they treat me like a king [x5]
They treat me like a king

[Verse 2]
I start it with nothing witness in the dick ride the fake ride
Never work on have to bout out that something greatest shit
Cause they come happy other rappers be undercovers
I might not shine as mush as the real nigga gonna get your face down Get a thick to speak the tree & watch the hood plan as they street [?]
Get out the truth and play the pitch I'm like the streets deal
My name stay on the corners like rumors the streets that get lose
Call me the cleaner man this hope nigga for less choose...
Put the Billboard I even come us on magazines
But still I'm made religion cause here there's nothing I've never seen
The nigga with [?] before I go head to team
I head the [?] so to the bottom like more than before we hear the dream
I got the movin in this streets they say is out of order
But they gifted like yeah soon as my voice touch and recorded
The politics that people feel it ain't have the bigger when it come to crowning this streets I bet they have to seat me

[Hook]
I'm respected in these streets, nigga they treat me like a king [x5]
They treat me like a king
They they treat me like a king
They they treat me like a king
I'm respected in these streets, nigga they treat me like a king

[Verse 3]
I'm the bullet up in the chain but is danger soon as I climb though
Took a player with can't get your thing put up in time moe
I lived the torch and now rap stratchin and tryin to put mine though
They scared I'm go exposing and leave the city to find though
I'm reachest to the G so it take a gangsta to know gangsta think
I got in this streets is gonna take here to told me these dope me
Niggas [?] cause I'm the streets and they belong me
Tell em the passage by abut now I'm back for what they owe me
[?] is in the streets so invisible it's a get in now industry
Say I'm here but I'm here don't tell me I'm pimpin
And if I wouldn't leave em spillin being in their topic
Since one of the realest niggas did it they never and I start it
Without a profit and represent it like Jordan while other people over thug the hood like we couldn't afford them
I stay to keep it real while other soul [?] without the shit they got it never equal my respect cause I'm a king
