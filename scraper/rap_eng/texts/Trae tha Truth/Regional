[Hook-Spodee]
I started out a local, now my distances is regional
A thousands pounds of midget, you can get it, but it's seasonal
Kush go for the high, but you keep coming, I'll be reasonable
Started off a local, now my operations regional
Keyshia Cole, that's molly then
I can bring it to you, but you gotta get a lotta them
All you see is ice on me
All I keep is goons around, boy don't lose your life for free

[Verse 1-Spodee]
I'm [?] price since '93
All I smoke is 93 (gas)
Took a trip to Akron, cause I heard they had them pints for three (that cash)
You ain't got 800 dollars, you can't get a pint from me
My true's sag "hold up, hold up", I don't wear no tiny jeans
I'm grown ho, go on ho, blow me til your tongues sore
Don't even try to act like that, you ain't got no tongue sores
I don't care nothing bout no bitch
You just want my [?] for sex
With all due respect, I was waiting on that insurance check
Super Spodee, [?] for goldy, I could pimp your wife today
I ate shrimp with rice today, and served a slice of spicy steak
I bought a new truck and put 'No Pressure' on my license plate
And I know a few niggas that'll come and take your life away

[Verse 2-Trae tha Truth]
I started off local, young nigga no plan
All this saved money got me feeling like the man
All I know is water in the pot, no pan
I ain't finna go back broke, ya understand?
I'm all up in this trap, hit it up, no fan
Bitch I got the Whitney, all that Bobby in the van
Next day is good, waiting on the day it land
Even if I middle man, that'll be a couple grand
Block crank up, they goin do whatever Trae say
Competition going "Man down", like mayday
No 1st and 15th, everyday a pay day
Any nigga end up getting caught best not say Trae
Yeah I got that Miley Ray Cyrus where the hoes at?
.38 black, this grip just froze that
Neighborhood pusher, nigga what it be like?
I can get you whatever you want if the fee right
Vacate some wins, to make a year [?]
Serving everything that was underneath the street lights
Only colors that I see be green, white
Tell um catch me in traffic, green lights
Come short, ya ass will get lost bitch
A1, that shit that gone cost bitch
No lip, ya ass will get frost bitch
Ask Spodee, he'll tell you I'm a boss, bitch

[Verse 3-Spodee]
Uhh, these niggas ain't tight as me, no
And I got access to the highest strand of weed, dope
I hate when niggas try and come explain a fee
You can't get a motherfucking thang for free
Being cool lame to me
I'm hot as a thang of grease
Man these niggas three crazy like Boosie said, but you are not the same as me
I got about a hundred niggas who bang with me
You niggas still wearing Prada, you lame to me
The same niggas need to ride to McDonald's
Gettin double cheeseburger with some dollars and change with [?]
I don't even eat that shit
We at Versace tables in the mansion with food
Now we smoking on Z with the OG's and you talking bout a dance you can do?
Man I'm way more advanced than the dude
Shouldn't even answer the dude
You fall asleep with your thumb in your mouth, on the couch, dawg you more gangsta than who?
