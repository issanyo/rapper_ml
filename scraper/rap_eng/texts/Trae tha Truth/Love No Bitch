(*talking*)
Huh, I guess these bitches thought they couldn't get it either
Shit, they get it worse then a nigga
Thought I forgot about everything huh, ain't shit changed
Still a Asshole By Nature, get on now bitch

[Trae]
I guess you thought that you was home free, with that shit that you did
Motherfuck your feelings, plus your bitch ass ain't just like a kid
Now I could recall way back in the gap, they told me I wasn't nothing
Look at me now, when I pass your ass on 24's that I'm strutting
I guess I came to my conclusion, niggas and bitches be the same
All you motherfuckers ain't shit, they ride your dick to get your change
Only change you get from Trae, is how I'm treating your ass
Don't hit my phone, better call that nigga who be beating your ass
And by the way, I really love the way that you try to hop fly
Bitch I don't smoke, but if I did you'd prolly be blowing my high
So catch this middle finger, and put that bitch somewhere you don't want it
I'm worth a mill at the least bitch, I know you hate that you don't it
But now I'm laughing at your bitch ass, cause you know that you gone
I know the shit that hurt the worst, is that you know that you gone
And that's a damn shame, and I bet you wish that I would take it the worse
But dig these blues, your trash ass just worked one verse

[Hook - 4x]
All that I know, is I really don't love no bitch

[Yung Redd]
You know what it is, you know how I live
It's no other way, but G
Shorty I'm so street, like the concrete under your feet
When I was broke, it was hard to see yourself with me
Listen, this time I got the upper hand
Black on black 7-60, low pro rubberbands
Understand, for them athletes I play the back seat
You love them niggas on your TV, but that's me
Overtime, all them hoes I charm
Came back with hopes, that I had open arms
But naw not at all, Yung Redd got it all
And the last thing, I need is a broad
I'm so large, I'ma tell you like a nigga told me
P-I-M-P, is what a bitch show me
Ay I'm paying my dues, you paying a tuition
But my hoes playing they position, I'm pimping

[Trae]
You can quit, calling my phone
You can quit, calling my phone
You can quit, calling my phone
Cause, I don't love no bitch - 2x

[Hook - 4x]

[Trae]
You can quit, calling my phone
You can quit, calling my phone
You can quit, calling my phone
Cause I don't love no bitch - 2x
