[Hook]
Rolling and restless, the plates say Texas
Rolling and restless, the plates say Texas
Rolling and restless, the plates say Texas
Rappin straight on, watch I'm young and I'm restless

[Verse 1]
Look, I'm rolling and restless, the plates say Texas
Shot in the Lexus, the paint say witness
Trappin for breakfast then get this money so reckless
By any means necessary, I'll grind til I'm breathless
I do this for Big Hawk, I do this for Fat Pat
I do this for Scroo Zoota, yelling where haters at?
9-5 great tapes, I'm tellin I'm bring it back
Dub's up out the roof, pull up with the ceiling cracked
Bulb light's turned on, glass looking so illegal
Old school military, came barkin like a beagle
Feelin like Iron Mike, I be damn I get faded
Whole world watchin too, gyeah I know them niggas hated

[Hook] x2
Rolling and restless, the plates say Texas
Rolling and restless, the plates say Texas
Rolling and restless, the plates say Texas
Rappin straight on, watch I'm young and I'm restless

[Verse 2]
I'm sittin in some foreign, shirt say Ralph Lauren
Ain't a hood I ain't stowing, fuck niggas I ain't bowin
Still on that grey cassette, pimp all up in my dick
Real nigga, don't disrespect, I take flight like a jet
Swangers look it's stitchers, trunk solved and like this tension
Slam on that other shit, ceiling with no suspension
Ain't no grass I ain't walkin
I'm Tha Truth, wutchu talkin?
Keep me a foreign bitch, with something pink like a dolphin
Everything heavy coated, Porsche moving like a stallion
Me, I just do the chain, a hundred with no medallion
Rolling and restless, somewhere off in the city
Thuggin into my casket, haters ain't fuckin with me

[Hook] x2
Rolling and restless, the plates say Texas
Rolling and restless, the plates say Texas
Rolling and restless, the plates say Texas
Rappin straight on, watch I'm young and I'm restless
