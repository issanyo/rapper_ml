[Verse 1: Berner]
They wonder why I would ever leave the game
'Cause they was speakin' on me when them people came
I just want the money I dont need the fame
And RIP to the Jack the band never be the same, JA
The dope game it tried to pull me in
I was countin' cocaine money with Peruvians
Tryna shake broke bitches, yeah I'm on the move again
Back to sendin' boxes out, I turn two to ten
Man this money feel good but it's temporarily
This shit don't last I'm smokin' at the cemetary
Thinkin' bout my homeboys the shit we did was legendary
I be spendin' outdoor money all February

[Hook: Berner]
Every time I leave they try to pull me in
Headshots, dead bodies though
I'm tired of losin' friends
Phone clickin', drug money got me on the move again
Freedom, nah that's somethin' I can't lose again
Every time I leave they try to pull me in
Headshots, dead bodies though
I'm tired of losin' friends
Phone clickin', drug money got me on the move again
Freedom, nah that's somethin' I can't lose again

[Verse 2: Berner]
When I die, will they forget my name?
And dont cry, 'cause I don't miss the pain
I love my daughter, yeah I miss her face
Lil bro got me, make sure the kids are safe
All the drama tryna pull me in
Fuck you too, yeah go ahead and lose with them
You with the shit? Go ahead and prove it then
We keep cannons stray bullets on the loose again
I'm in my Benz ridin' through Marin
Blue pills, duffel bags full of, big blue bills to spend
When we touch down we open up boxes
I'mma ball all summer with my profit
We live to die young

[Hook: Berner]
Every time I leave they try to pull me in
Headshots, dead bodies though
I'm tired of losin' friends
Phone clickin', drug money got me on the move again
Freedom, nah that's somethin' I can't lose again
Every time I leave they try to pull me in
Headshots, dead bodies though
I'm tired of losin' friends
Phone clickin', drug money got me on the move again
Freedom, nah that's somethin' I can't lose again

[Verse 3: Trae Tha Truth]
Next to God I got no fear
All I lost it's been a cold year
Pain got me numb, ain't no more tears
Pray to fly away but ain't no lears
Thinkin' bout Jack, I'm thinkin' bout my brother
Think he doin' life I'd hate to be my mother
Homie say they love us why they undercover?
Talkin' to the people, came up from the gutta
Fuck 'em, I stay out of their way
No love I ride around with the K
God got me, in the night I don't pray
Gotta to what's best for Trae
Used to be a cool nigga
All that fuck shit turned me into a fool nigga
Shit real, I can show you what to do nigga
That's 1 triple 0 times 2 nigga
In the field with that late night, no lights
For my niggas in the pen give no kites
Tryna win nigga fuck seeing slow nights
I ain't tryna hear shit nigga show right
Haters, I don't understand them
I'm tryna live I'm tryna see that Phantom
Look at this wrist I dropped a 100 band on
King of the city why they wanna ban him?

[Hook: Berner]
Every time I leave they try to pull me in
Headshots, dead bodies though
I'm tired of losin' friends
Phone clickin', drug money got me on the move again
Freedom, nah that's somethin' I can't lose again
Every time I leave they try to pull me in
Headshots, dead bodies though
I'm tired of losin' friends
Phone clickin', drug money got me on the move again
Freedom, nah that's somethin' I can't lose again
