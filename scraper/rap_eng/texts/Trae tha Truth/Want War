And if these niggas want war
Then we gonna ride
And if a nigga disrespects
Then we gonna ride
My niggas low enough in choppers
We 'bout to ride
'Cause all we know is homicide, then we gonna die
And if a nigga sneak this, then we gonna ride
It's 28 for the brick, so we gonna buy
Them bricks sitting right there, then we gonna rob
'Cause everybody they done with talking homicide

Ar-Ab-

4 deep in the van and we 'bout that
30 shot extendos up in our strap
Only call my phone if it's about racks
Got two whole walls buried out back
I caught niggas up took two bricks
So they shot me ten times in my new whip
Me and Cass for the murder, he ain't do shit
I had to kill a nigga, I was cool with it
Drugs and racks every night with my black dorm
I turn for an order and a popcorn
My niggas... got life 'cause you rock for it
A nigga came up short, he got shot for it
Since 14 I was on my own, before I wrote a song I was cooking zone
Getting up in the morning tryina get 'em going
OBA's family, I'm a put 'em all

And if these niggas want war
Then we gonna ride
And if a nigga disrespects
Then we gonna ride
My niggas low enough in choppers
We 'bout to ride
'Cause all we know is homicide, then we gonna die
And if a nigga sneak this, then we gonna ride
It's 28 for the brick, so we gonna buy
Them bricks sitting right there, then we gonna rob
'Cause everybody they done with talking homicide


Trae Da Truth-

Yo, I'm a different type of lame
Letting your blanket lay
Licking the tub but the tub is licking your face
Got a hell of a bite, the... sleep with their pipe
But never fucking with the kind, I was coming tonight
See, I do what I need, never do if I hate
Head them bullets out the top, imitating the flight
If you ain't about it, you ain't doing it right
Leave a nigga's whole neighborhood covered in white
Me and Ar-ab just quit the quick, certified street, sip what you get
There they go with these... nigga underground
But I bet you nigga know we exist, cost I pay through thumb, get no secret
I'm here to get paid, I don't get no stick
Riding through the air, I don't get no quit
Ar-ab and gang niggas know I'm rich
Then they look, they tripping, I'm a let out a shot
There's something whipping, I'm a let off the top
My niggas hungry I'm a tell them to shop
They go be tripping till I tell them to stop
Fuck a pussy, obviously they get guap
Try to get it and get tossed like a block
Guess I'm sick of niggas running their mouth
Fuck the weather, I can get you that hot
Yeah, I can make these niggas famous, we'll gonna move it
Shake your dress, then come and ride
I'd like tonight do things too many, gonna blast it
I was heavy with this,.. when I'm light that blasting
Just to put you in that casket, pussy nigga




And if these niggas want war
Then we gonna ride
And if a nigga disrespects

My niggas low enough in choppers
We 'bout to ride
'Cause all we know is homicide, then we gonna die
And if a nigga sneak this, then we gonna ride
It's 28 for the brick, so we gonna buy
Them bricks sitting right there, then we gonna rob
